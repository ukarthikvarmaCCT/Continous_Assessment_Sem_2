 unke liye kosh kaa uchit upyog vahi vidvan kar paata he jise vah kanthsth ho
 Shlokas become memorized quickly
 isliye sanskrit ke sabhi madhyakaalin kosh padya main hai
 Seventy years ago the Italian poet Pavolini proved that these Sanskrit lexicons are a collection of important and less useful words for poets
 amarkosh aisa hi ek kosh he
 The real name of Amarkosh is Namliganushasana according to Amarsingh
 naam kaa arth yahan sangya shabd he
 Amarkosh has the discipline or education of the noun and its gender
 avyay bhi die gaye hai, kintu dhaatu nahin hai
 The shells of metals were different
 halaayudh ne apana kosh likhane kaa prayojan kavikanthvibhusanartham bataaya he
 Dhananjaya has written about his dictionary - i am writing this for the benefit of poets
 amarsingh is vishay par maun hai, kintu unka uddeshy bhi yahi rahaa hoga
 Amarkosh is full of ordinary Sanskrit words as well as extraordinary names
 aarambh hi dekhie- devataaon ke naamon main lekha shabd kaa prayog amarsingh ne kahan dekha, pataa nahin
 Such heavy and nominal words are stored in this dictionary, such as Devdrayang or Vishdrayang
 kathin, dularbh or vicitra shabd dhundh-dhundhakar rakhana koshkaron kaa ek kartavya mana jaataa tha
 Namasya is the word of Rigveda
 dwivachan main naasatya, aisa hi shabd he
 In these dictionaries of medieval times, Prakrit words at that time have also been kept as Sanskrit
 madhyakaal ke in koshon main, us samay praakrit shabdon ke atyadhik prayog ke kaaran, kai praakrit shabd sanskrit maane gaye hai; jaise-chhurik, dhakka, gargari, duli, aadi
 The influence of buddhist-deformed-sanskrit is also evident, such as Arkabandhu, a namapariya of Buddha
 buddha-vikrut-sanskrit main bataaya gaya he ki arkabandhu naam bhi kosh main de diya
 Other names like Buddha's 'sugat' etc
 are similar
 amarkosh par aaj tak 40 se bhi adhik tikaaon kaa pranayan kiya ja chukaa he
 Some of the major commentaries are as follows - ramashrami tikaa main, amarkosh main pariganit shabdon kii vyutpatti or nirukti di gayi he
 Hindi translation of this commentary is not available yet
 yah amarkosh kii ekmaatr aisi tikaa he, jisamen shabdon kii vyakaranik vyutpattiyon ke saath–saath nirukti bhi di gayi he
 It is said in Yask Krit Nirukta - isi siddhanth kaa paalan karte hue bhanuji deekshith ne amarkosh main pariganit shabdon kaa nirvachan kiya he
 They also interpret all words as metal
 peetikashlokacharant in vachaspatyam Heaven buddhih Land: namaskritam Poojitam kakarantah Classboli, professional dialect, or jargon are special words used by a particular occupation, field, or class
 vargboli isliye viksit ho jaati hai kyonki "har vigyaan kii apni vishesh bhashaa hoti he kyonki har vigyaan ke apane vishesh vichaar hote hai"
 Like slang, the class is also full of words for a particular class that is of interest or interest to the people of that class
 jahaan kathboli aupchaarik bhashaa kaa bhaag nahin hoti, vahaan vargboli aksar sabhy or aupchaarik prayog ke liye uchit maani jaati he
 Common people outside the class often find the class technical, difficult, bizarre or incomprehensible, while members of the class use it easily
 udhaaharan ke liye sanganakon se parichit log praayah 'bit', 'bite', 'ram', 'sipiu' or 'hexadesimal' jaise vargboli shabdon kaa prayog karte hai jinhen sanganakon se aparichit log bilkul nahin samaj sakate

 ] The carbon dioxide from the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the ph
 Carbon dioxide will start to carbonate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made
 This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete
 If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide of the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete
 When designing a concrete structure, it is normal to state the concrete cover for the rebar 
 The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes
 If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur
 One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the surface with phenolphthalein
 This will turn when in contact with alkaline cement, making it possible to see the depth of carbonatation
 An existing hole is no good because the exposed surface will already be carbonated ---> ] This phenomenon has been popularly referred to as "concrete cancer"

 In this way, the construction of paper, the history of printing, development of various methods of printing of pictures, various activities performed during the construction of a book, etc
 all come under the term 'bibliography'
 granthsuchee vastut: soochiptr kaa hi ek rup he, par donon shabd paryaayavachi nahin hai
 The catalog contains knowledge of the literature available in any one library or museum
 soochiptr kisi prakaashak dwaara prakashit granthon kii suchi maatr bhi ho saktaa he tathaa kisi pustak vikreta dwaara beche janevaale granthon kii suchi bhi
 It is considered sufficient to give a minimum description of the texts which are included in the catalog
 isse kisi granth ke astitv maatr kaa gyaan hi ho paata he
 The method of preparing the catalog is also simple
 vah yaa to granthon ko dekhakar taiyaar kiya jaataa he yaa kisi duusare soochiptr kii sahaayta se
 Sometimes assistance of other libraries and scholars is also taken to prepare the catalog
 soochiptr main granthon kaa jo vivaran diya jaataa he, usase kaai vyakti yah pataa nahin laga saktaa ki kisi granth kaa mudran kin paristhitiyon main hua tathaa us granth ke baad ke sanskarnon main yadi koi parivartan, sanshodhan kiya gaya, to kyon? Although the area of the bibliography is also limited to a few pieces, its range may be minimal if on one side and very wide on the other
 granthsuchee ke antargat kisi ek lekhak, prakaashak, mudrak, vishay, kaal yaa desh se sambandhit granthon kii suchi ko liya ja saktaa he
 If available in a library of texts related to any author, publisher, printer, subject, period or country; Or other type of bibliographic material, such as all types of published unpublished literature, pamphlets, journals, newspapers and 'reprints' of maps printed in them, maps, drawings, microfilm material, handwritten texts, etc
 prepared with a particular purpose and order
 If it goes, it will be called a bibliography
 ise or adhik spasht karne ke liye ek udhaaharan lenaa apraasangik nahin hoga
 The list of all the texts available in the Aryabhasha Library of Nagri Pracharini Sabha, Kashi, will be called 'catalog of Aryabhasa Library'

 The bibliography is restricted by some form of limitation
 yah seemaa bahut vyapak or bahut choti bhi ho sakati he
 If in the above example, a list of only the literature written and related by Premchand is published in a certain period, ie between 1920 and 1930, then this bibliography is limited to the subject 'premchand', a certain Also limited by time
 is granthsuchee ko, yadi koi chaahe to, 'premchand kaa kahani sahitya : 1920- 1930' tak bhi simit kiya ja saktaa he
 On the contrary, if one wishes, one can also include Premchand Krit and the entire literature related to them, translated and published in all the languages of the world
 aisi sthiti main granthsuchee kii seemaa bahut adhik bad jaaegi
 The point is to say that the bibliography is always limited to some direction, but on the contrary, the catalog should not be limited to any one subject, period or place
 soochiptr kii tulana main granthsuchee apane uddeshy main bhi simit hoti he
 According to the subject and purpose, the order of the texts in the bibliography is there and one of the main features of the bibliography is that it is all-inclusive within its prescribed range, although nowadays only a bibliography of selected literature is also compiled for some new and difficult subjects
 Has started going granthsuchee or soochiptr main doosraa mukhya antar yah hota he ki soochiptr kaa upyog mukhyat: pustkaalay ke sadsy yaa anusandhankarta aavashyak granth praapt karne yaa unke sambandh main aavashyak sankshipt vivaran praapt karne ke liye karte hai
 In contrast, the bibliography is used only for a fixed and limited purpose
 soochiptr se saamanyat: kisi granth ke sambandh main lekhak kaa naam tathaa uski prakationatithi hi gyaat ho sakati he, par granthsuchee main die gaye vivaran se sabhi prakaar kaa aavashyak sambhavit vivaran, jaise granth kaa lekhak, naam, mulya, prishthsankhya, prakaashak, prakashansthaan or tithi, aakaar prakaar, sanskaran, prakaashan sambandhi koi mahatvapurn tathy tathaa isi prakaar kaa anya vivaran bhi praapt hota he
 The bibliography can be of many types, but its main forms are as follows: arthath kisi desh main prakashit samast sahitya kii suchi
 It cannot be denied that the entire literature published in a country should be accessible to the people of that country without any objection
 koi vyakti yaa sanstha sabhi prakashit sahitya nahin kharid sakati
 Therefore, this literature should be kept in a place where everyone can use it equally
 yah kaary desh vishesh kii sarkaar dwaara hi sambhav he
 For this purpose, national libraries have been established in almost all the countries of the world
 par keval itane se hi samasya hal nahin ho jaati
 The library cannot be fully utilized without any means of knowing what literature has been stored in the library, and whether there are any texts or not
 duusari baat yah bhi he ki kisi bhi desh kii samskruti itani sampann nahin hoti ki vah duusare deshon se bina kuch liye die hi falti phoolati rahe
 Nowadays, when it is considered necessary for the whole world to be tied in one thread from the point of view of science and humanity, it has become necessary for the researchers also to be aware of the progress and progress made in other countries
 at: prayek desh kii sarkaar kaa yah kartavya ho jaataa he ki vah koi aisa saadhan prastut kare jisase desh ke logon ko hi nahin varan videshiyon kii bhi desh main prakashit sahitya kii soochna mili
 The national bibliography serves this purpose
 rashtriya granthsuchee main kisi desh main prakashit sabhi prakaar ke evam sabhi vishyon ke samast granthon kaa vivaran diya rahata he
 This list is usually prepared on the basis of literature stored in the national library of the country
 abhi tak kisi bhi desh main aisi rashtriya granthsuchee taiyaar nahin ho saki he jisamen us desh main prakashit sampurna sahitya kaa vivaran ho
 The national bibliography is in fact the result of this century
 britain jaise desh main bhi 1950 se purv koi rashtriya granthsuchee nahin thi
 The British National Bibliography started publication there from 1950
 yah suchi yahan ke rashtriya pustkaalay- british museum ke pustkaalay- main kapirite kanoon ke antargat praapt hue granthon ke aadhaar par taiyaar kii jaati he
 In India, the year 1958 should be considered very important from the point of view of bibliography when the publication of the National Library Bibliography started there
 is suchi main bharat ke rashtriya pustkaalay main kapirite kanoon ke antargat praapt sabhi bhashaaon ke sabhi granthon kaa vivaran diya rahata he, par hindi tathaa anya bhartiya bhashaaon kaa durbhaagya hi he ki yah suchi keval roman lipi main prakashit hoti he
 In this way, the problem of literature of all Indian languages published in India after 1958 and thereafter has been solved a lot, but no bibliography of literature published in India before 1958 is available till date nor the Kai plan is under consideration
 
 lekin bharat ko is baat kaa garv hona chahie ki yahan rashtriya granthsuchee kaa prakaashan aarambh ho chukaa he jabaki kai deshon main abhi tak koi rashtriya granthsuchee prakashit nahin hui he
 The list of national libraries here can be used only by those who can visit the library themselves
 iske atirikt doosraa ekmaatr upaay patravyavhaar dwaara kisi granthvishesh ke sambandh main jaankaree praapt karnaa he
 But now, with the influence and cooperation of UNESCO, plans for publication of national bibliography are under consideration in some countries and it is expected that for the next two decades, national bibliography will be published in almost all countries
 rashtriya granthsuchee ke prasang main vishwa granthsuchee par dhyaan janaa swaabhaavik he
 Many efforts have been made in the world for world bibliography from time to time since the 18th century, but none of the efforts were successful
 vishwa granthsuchee ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi britain kii royal sosayadi ne sarvapratham vaigyanik sahitya kaa soochiptr prakashit karnaa aarambh kiya, par sheeghra hi yah prayaas sthagit kar dena padaa
 After this, an international catalog of scientific literature was planned as a supplement to the above list
 yah yojana bhi kuch samay tak hi chal saki
 The failure of both the above schemes revealed a number of problems related to the world bibliography, which did not normally get the attention of scholars
 in donon yojanaon ke baad bhi royal sosayadi is kshetra main kuch na kuch karti rahi he
 No matter how much money a library spends, it cannot buy the entire published literature of all countries
 british museum ke pustakalayadhyaksh anthoni panijee is pustkaalay main vishwa ke sabhi deshon main prakashit sarvshereshth granth rakhana chaahate the
 For this purpose, they tried to get the best literature of all the languages of the world, but for many reasons they could not succeed in their efforts
 america kaa congress pustkaalay bhi, jo vishwa kaa sabase bada pustkaalay mana jaataa he, vishvapustkaalay nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But the catalogs of the world's major libraries fill the gap of 'world bibliography' in very few portions, since these libraries have been trying to collect useful and important texts published in all the countries of the world
 aadhunik yug main vishwa granthsuchee ke mahatv kaa anumaan keval isi tathy se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unesco kaa praaia: prayek vibhaag or shakha granthsuchee ke vikaas main kisi na kisi rup main sambhddha he tathaa vividh vishyon kii granthsuchee taiyaar karan evam unase sambhddha samasyaon ke hal ke liye unescon ne alag alag samitiyaan sthapit kii he
 In order to improve the current state of bibliography in the world, members of the international conference which took place in Paris under the auspices of UNESCO in 1950, unanimously came to the conclusion that a 'bibliographic center' should be established in every country at the national level
 Where various necessary work related to bibliography can be done
 baad main inhen kendron kii sahaayta se vahaan kii rashtriya granthsuchee bhi prakashit kii ja sakati he
 These bibliographic centers established at the national level will be useful as foundations for world bibliography
 soochiptr bhi kuch seemaa tak granthsuchee kaa rup le sakate hai
 If a catalog of texts of only a certain subject is available in a library, it can be used as a bibliography to some degree
 adhikansh prasiddh evam bade pustakaalayon ke vishay soochiptr kalantar main vishay granthsuchee kaa mahatv praapt kar lete hai
 The feature of the texts included in the catalogs is not usually that they are works of a particular author, or because all the texts are related to a single subject, although in case of some catalogs both or any of the above is also correct
 Can
 varan un granthon main visheshta yah hoti he ki ve kisi ek prakaashak dwaara prakashit hote hai, kisi pustak vikreta ke yahan krayarth praapt hote hai yaa ve kisi pustkaalay ke sangrah main hote hai
 But the importance of large library catalogs is similar to the bibliography
 isi kaaran britain ke british museum pustkaalay, america ke congress pustkaalay or france ke 'bibliothek neshnal' ke soochipatron kii gananaa granthsuchee kii koti main hoti he
 The main purpose of their compilation and the main similarity of the texts involved is that they are related to any one subject
 yah granthsuchee, anya prakaar kii granthsuchiyon ke samaan samasamyik granthon kii bhi ho sakati he tathaa purvakaleen granthon kii bhi
 It can also be vivid or only selected literature, likewise there may or may not be commentary with details of the texts involved
 iskaa prakaashan patrapatrika ke rup main nirdhaarit samay main bhi ho saktaa he, choti pustika ke rup main bhi or swatantra granth ke rup main bhi
 Author titles 'supporting bibliography', 'other literature', 'readable literature' or useful literature, etc
, sometimes as independent chapters or appendices at the end of some passages of university textbooks and scientific texts, and at the end of some important research texts
 List some texts by giving
 kuch patrapatrikaon main prakashit mahatvapurn lekhon ke ant main bhi kabhi kabhi sahaayak granthsuchee di rahati he
 Similarly, a brief bibliography is given at the end of encyclopedias and research articles
 inhen bhi granthsuchee kaa hi ek rup maananaa chahie
 With the continuous growth of published texts in all the countries of the world, the need for author and subject bibliography also increases
 paashchaatya deshon main praaia: sabhi prasiddh lekhakon kii granthsuchee prakashit ho chuki he
 Some bibliographies of some authors have been published for different purposes
 lekin keval granthsuchee ke prakashit ho jane se hi samasya hal nahin ho jaati
 Unless there is no means to find out which books of which author and which subjects are available and what kind of bibliographies are available, then the available bibliographies cannot be fully utilized
 isi uddeshy se ab 'granthsuchiyon kii granthsuchee' ke sankalan kii ore paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakarshith hua he or europea bhashaaon main ab tak kai choti badi 'granthsuchiyon kii granthsuchee' prakashit ho chuki he
 In this connection, 'A World Bibliography of Bibliography' compiled by Theodore Westerman is notable
 is vishaal granth main vishwa kii bhashaaon main prakashit 84, 403 granthsuchiyon kaa satippan vivaran diya gaya he
 This new form of bibliography came to light early in the same century
 is prakaar ek vishay ke prakashit aprakashit mahatvapurn sahitya kaa vishad parichay diya rahata he
 a bibliography of this type has also been published in Hindi
 granthsuchee ke uparyukt prakaaron ke atirikt kuch anya prakaar bhi hai jinamein anukramanikas tathaa abstracts mukhya hai
 The most important and important thing in compiling any bibliography is that its purpose should be clear
 granthsuchee main shaamil kiye janevaale granthon kaa kram uske uddeshy par hi nirbhar rahanaa he
 The texts to be included in any bibliography can be placed in any of the following order: acaradi kram
 According to the name of the author, according to the name of the book, the name of the subject or the place of publication
 kalkram, Classified, bhugolic kram According to the type of texts
 yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy prayek granth kaa vivaran dena maatr he to sabhi granth lekhakon ke naam se acaradi kram se rakhana upyukt hoga
 If the purpose of the bibliography is to tell the development of the history of a subject or to introduce the literature development of a famous writer, then all the texts should be kept from the chronological arrangement
 yadi pathakon ko upyogi evam mahatvapurn granthon ke sambandh main dishpradarshan karnaa ho to granthsuchee ke ant main acaradi kram main vishay anukramani dekar aisa kiya ja saktaa he or yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy keval yah batalaana he ki vishay par ab tak koun koun se granth likhe ja chuke hai tathaa kis ang kii abhi tak kami he to kisi vargeekaran paddati ke aadhaar par sampurna sahitya ko vargeekrut kram main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if the importance of the texts to be included in the bibliography is due to a place or geographical area, then all literature can be placed in geographical order
 granthsuchee ke saamaan yah arth bhi simit kshetra main prayukt hota he
 This meaning is mainly used only for texts published before the machine era and at the beginning of the machine age
 aadhunik kaal main vaigyanik yantron kaa itnaa adhik vikaas ho chukaa he, tathaa mudrankala ke kshetra main bhi itani adhik pragati ho chuki he ki kisi ek granth kii lakhon karodon pratiyaan bina kisi shaareerik shram ke mudrit kii ja sakati hai, saath hi is baat kii jaraa bhi sambhaavna nahin rahati ki in pratiyon main aapas main kisi prakaar kaa antar hoga
 Therefore, in modern times there is no question of 'description' of printed texts
 granthavarnan se taatpary granth ke vishayvarnan se nahin varan granth ke bahya rup, uske nirmaan evam astitv main aane kii vividh kriyaaon se he
 Before the machine era when texts were written by hand, it could not be expected that any two copies of the same book would be identical in every way
 or to or, unka kaagaj bhi ek sa nahin ho saktaa tha, phir likhaawat, chitrakaari, paragraph, 'pruf' kii ashuddhiyaan, hashia, aadi main to or bhi zyada asamanta rahati thi
 Even after almost 100 years or more after the invention of printing, the development of printing was not well
 is samay bhi mudrasambandhi adhikansh kaary maanav shakti dwaara hote the
 Therefore, it was natural that there should be some difference between two copies of the same book
 us kaal ke chape granthon ko dekhne par pataa chalata he ki ek hi samay or ek hi saath chhapi ek hi granth kii do pratiyon main compojing, mechap, pruf, formon kii sajaavat aadi main ascharyajanak asamanta he
 In the modern period, while in the early years of the invention of handwritten texts and printing of ancient times, the collection of printed texts has attracted the attention of artisans and literary institutions and collectors of handwritten texts at high prices for manuscripts of famous authors and their books Started collecting early versions, it became necessary for their convenience Land that Jayँ produce a Grnthsuchiya including original description
 is varnan ko dekhakar asli or nakli prati kaa bhed aasaani se kiya ja sake tathaa kalapremi sangraahak dhokhebaajon evam jaalsaajon dwaara thage na ja saken
 Needless to say that many fraudsters in Western countries have earned millions and crores by copying the manuscripts of famous authors and preparing 'fake first editions' of their texts
 baad main vastusthiti kii jaankaree hone par sangraahakon ko haath malkar rah janaa padaa he
 In order to protect art lovers and collectors from fraud, the description given in the bibliography is complete in itself and sufficient to identify any book
 paashchaatya granthon ke varnan ke liye vahaan ke vidwaanon ne granthavarnan kii kuch vishesh vidhiyaan maanya kii hai
 Granthwaran is actually a type of sign language that only the experienced can understand
 hastlikhit granthon tathaa mudrit granthon ke liye alag alag vidhiyaan tathaa niyam hai
 Similarly bibliography is also given more or less according to the purpose of the bibliography
 yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy maatr ek 'suchi' hi taiyaar karnaa he to suchi main shaamil kiye janevaale granthon kaa aavashyak sankshipt vivaran diya jaataa he, par yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy granthon kaa vishad parichay dena hota he to granth ke pratham prishth se lekar antim prishth tak kaa puraa vivaran, chitron kaa puraa vivaran, prayek prishth kii mukhya mukhya visheshtaayen yadi hon, hashia kaa kram, paragraphon kaa kram, compojing kaa kram prayek prishth main kitni panktiyaan hai, yadi kisi prishth main kam yaa adhik panktiyaan hai to isaki soochna, koi pankti yadi kisi vishesh sthaan se prarambh hoti ho to uskaa vivaran, aadi sookshmatisookshm prayek baat kaa varnan, 'granth varnan' ke antargat aata he
 If two copies of an ancient book are available, then their physical designs are compared among themselves and if there is any difference between them, this fact is mentioned in 'granthwaran' and the attention of the collectors is drawn to this
 kisi ek granth kii do pratiyon main koi antar hone kaa arth yah kadaapi nahin ki donon main se ek prati jaali he
 Even if there is a difference between the two copies, both copies can be real, because there can be many possible reasons for the difference between them
 granthavarnan ke prasang main in kaarnon par vistrut rup se vichaar kar kisi ek nishkarsh par pahunchnaa hota he
 The detailed bibliography of this type is given in the list of books, which facilitates art lovers, collectors and librarians, but their use does not end here
 saahitiyik drushti se bhi granthavarnan kaa kuch mahatv rahata he
 Texts and other similar material by which ideas are expressed are often not true models of the author's ideas
 kabhi kabhi aisa hota he ki lekhak apane vichaaron ko thik-thik vyakt karne ke liye upyukt shabd nahin khoj paata tathaa kabhi kabhi vah aise shabdon kaa bhi prayog karata he jiskaa arth pathak yaa shrota kii drushti main kuch or hi hota he
 It is also necessary to pay attention to one other fact in this regard
 yadi lekhak swayan apane granth ko mudrit karata yaa uski hastlikhit pratiyaan taiyaar karata he tab to kisi prakaar ke bhram yaa galat shabd ke prayog kii sambhaavna praaia: nahin rahati lekin vastusthiti kuch or hi he
 When a book which comes out of the pen and brain of the writer comes out in printed form, then many other people are responsible for that form, not the writer
 in logon kaa saahitiyik gyaan praaia: shunya rahata he tathaa jis vishay ke granth ko ve taiyaar kar rahe hote hai us vishay se bhi ve praaia: anbhigya rahete hai
 In such a situation, complete justice cannot be done to the writer
 iske atirikt kabhi kabhi aisa bhi dekha jaataa he ki lekhak apni mul prati main jo kuch likhata he, use mudrit rup main dekhne par uskaa arth badalata hua najar aata he
 Even if the author himself takes a lot of caution in proof-reading and reduces that possibility a lot and thus has little control over the medium of expressing his ideas, there is no evidence that this control is completely 'impeccable'
 vastusthiti yah he ki lekhak swayan hi sab kuch nahin karata
 Even after self-proof reading, he has to depend on others for later actions
 at: 'truti maanav se hoti he', is siddhant ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki lekhak ke kaaphi saavdhaanee rakhane par bhi anya vyaktiyon dwaara koi galti ho jane kii sambhaavna bani rahati he
 Many famous authors have acknowledged that their texts are not in physical form exactly as they had imagined
 at: kalpana or yatharth ke antar ko dur karne ke liye granthavarnan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As a matter of fact, Granthavarnan is like a bridge for literary review
 kisi granth kii vishay vastu kaa moolyankan karne ke purv sameekshak ko is baat se aashwast hona aavashyak he ki samiksha ke liye vah granth kii jis prati kaa upyog kar rahaa he, vah lekhak ke mul paath ke adhaar par hi taiyaar hui he
 If it is not so, then it becomes necessary to establish a relationship between them by looking at copies of all the volumes of the book
 kyonki kis granth kaa itihaas vastut: uske lekhak ke sahitiyik itihaas kaa hi ek mahatvapurn ang he
 It is also necessary for the reviewer to know the history of the text of the treatise, so that it can identify the version that is most closely to the author's original manuscript or to which the author himself has made an amendment
 sameekshak ko yah bhi gyaat hona chahie ki us granth main baad main kya kya nai saamagree jodi gai yaa usamen se koun sa ansh nikaal diya gaya, yah parivartan, parivardhan swayan lekhak dwaara yaa uski anumati se kiya gaya yaa mudrak, prakaashak athwa kisi anya vyakti dwaara
 The dates and the order of all the editions of a book should also be known to the reviewer
 yah spasht he ki itnaa sab vivaran praapt karnaa yaa taiyaar karnaa sameekshak kaa kaary nahin
 His task is only to study the content of the book and examine its quality
 at: sameekshak kii sahaayta ke liye granthsuchee main granthavarnan dena aavashyak ho jaataa he
 3- Study of the scripture as a physical substance, as stated in the beginning, under this meaning, the study and history of all the methods and things that help in the construction of a book
 yahan granth ke paath se kuch bhi taatpary nahin, kushal bibliographer keval yah dekhtaa he ki yah granth kaise bana tathaa granthanirmaan kii jo nirdhaarit maanya vidhiyaan hai un sabhi kaa prayog kis granth ke nirmaan main hua yaa nahin
 This study comprehensively covers the method of paper making, the difference in different types of paper, and their properties, various printing methods and their characteristics, the various functions that fall under the printing method, the method of manufacturing the type, the working of the printing machines, the binding
 Everything is considered
 ukt teen arthon ko dekhne se yah spost pataa chalata he ki pratham do arth aapas main poorak hai kyonki grathvarnan granthsuchee main hi diya jaataa he tathaa varnan ke abhaav main granthsuchee or soochiptr main koi antar nahin rah jaataa
 Scholars have raised counter-arguments from time to time regarding the third meaning and have questioned that the compiler of the bibliography does not have to have knowledge of printing
 par aadhunik vidwaanon ne jab yah maan liya he ki mudrankala kaa gyaan hue bina koi bhi vyakti granthsuchee kaa sakanlan nahin kar saktaa
 In fact, the bibliography is a concordance of the above three meanings
 granthsuchee vahi hoti he jisamen kisi ek nishchit pranali ke anusaar granthvivaran diya gaya ho
 According to the famous scholar Dr
 Greg, the bibliography refers to the study of the text in physical form, no relation to its content here
 isi prakaar prasiddh america vidvan dow boars ke mat se granthon kii suchi maatr taiyaar karnaa to soochikaran hi kaha jayega, par yadi us suchi main granthon kaa varnan bhautik padaarth ke rup main diya jaae to use sahi arth main 'vaigyanik evam vidhiwat granthsuchee' kaha janaa chahie
 Dr
 Boers went a step further in favor of making such a bibliography an analytical bibliography
 unka mat he ki granthsuchee main kisi granth kaa jo vivaran diya jaataa he, usak uddeshy us granth kii 'adarsh prati' kaa pataa lagaana he
 By ideal copy, he does not mean a copy that has no defects, but is a copy that originates at the beginning of the printer, no matter how many textual errors it contains
 aisi 'adarsh prati' kaa yathatathy granthavarnan karne ke liye mudran kala kaa vishad gyaan hona aavashyak he
 All the actions that have been used in the making of a book are mentioned in the Granthavarnan
 mudran kriyaaon kaa gyaan kisi granth ke keval mul paath kii drushti se hi nahin varan us granth kaa itihaas jaanane ke liye bhi sahaayak hota he
 Having knowledge of printing, the entire history of that book can be told by looking at different versions of the same book
 kisi granth kaa bhautik rup se sookshmatisookshm adhyayan uske mul paath sambandhi vivaadaaspad prashnon ko sulajhane main sahaayak hota he
 Along with this, sometimes he also draws attention to such things which have not been noticed by the scholars before
 yah sahitiyik drushti se to mahatvapurn he hi, anusandhan kii drushti se bhi isaki upyogita se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In the words of Dr
 Gragg, if the word literature is not taken in its limited sense, but in a detailed sense, then the text description should be called the grammar of literature
 momahil sar karakoram parvat shrunkhlaa kii histor muzataag upashrunkhalaa ek parvat he
 It is located in the gilgit-baltistan region of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which India calls its share
