 When i started his death in 1987, after my deekshaguru's body was quiet, i decided to do nothing except to become an element
 kisise kuch maanganaa nahin he 
 Do not keep the money with you nor touch it
 apni orese kahin janaa nahin he, jisko garaj hogi, vah le jaayga 
 After this i came in contact with Sethji Shrijaydalji Goindka, the founder of gitapress
 ve meri drushtimen bhagwatprapt mahapurush the 
 He had a special impact on my life

 maine kisi bhi vyakti, sanstha, ashram adise vyaktigat sambandh nahin joda he 
 Even if the relationship was related to someone, it was immediate, not forever
 main sadaa tatva kaa anuyaayi rahaa hoon, vyaktika nahin 
 4
 It has always been my view that people should not be engaged in me or any particular person, but in God
 vyaktipujaka main kadaa nishedh karata hoon 
 5
 i have no place, monastery or ashram
 meri koi gaddi nahin he or na hi maine kisiko apana shishy prachaarak athwa uttaradhikari banaaya he 
 After me only my books will guide the seekers
 gitapresski pustakonka prachaar, goraksha tathaa satsangka main sadaiv samarthak rahaa hoon 
 6
 i strongly prohibit drawing my picture, step-touching, cheering, garlanding etc
 7
 main prasad yaa bhentrupase kisiko maala, dupatta, vastra, kambal aadi pradaan nahin karata 
 i myself do body-care from alms
 8
 satsang-kaarykramake liye rupee ikattha karneka main virodh karata hoon 
 9
 i do not give blessings / curses or boons to anyone nor do i consider myself worthy of it
 10
 main apane darshanaki apeksha gangaji, surya athwa bhagavadvigrahake darshanako hi adhik mahatva detaa hoon 
 11
 Rupees and women - i have completely abandoned the touch of these two
 12
 jis patr-patrika athwa smarikaamein vigyaapan chhapate hon, unamem main apana lekh prakashit karne kaa nishedh karata hoon 
 Similarly, i also prohibit printing my name in the material published for the promotion of my shop, business etc
 gitapresski pustakonke prachaarke sandarbhamen yah niyam lagu nahin he 
 13
 i have kept such dignity in satsang that men and women sit separately
 mere aage thodi doortak keval purush baithen 
 Arrange for men and make arrangements for men and women
 kisi batkaa samarthan karne athwa bhagavanaki jai bolaneke samay keval purush hi apane haath unche karen, striyaan nahin 
 14
 Karmayoga, Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga - Among the three, i consider Bhakti Yoga to be the best and in the attainment of the supreme love, i consider the perfection of human life
 15
 jo vaktaa apneko meraa anuyaayi athwa kripapaatr bataakar logon se maan-badai karwaata he, rupee letaa he, striyonse sampark rakhata he, bhent letaa he athwa vastuen maangata he, usko thag samajhnaa chaiye

 And "mahapurushon ke satsang kii baaten " naamak pustak main bhi aap donon mahapurushon ke milan kaa varnan he)
 You say that attaining God is not difficult
 paramatma kii prapti bani sugamawa se ho sakati he or bahut jaldi, tatkaal ho sakati he
 Man is the only inborn person of divine attainment, no matter what it is
 kam se- kam samay main or murkh se murkh manushya ko tathaa paapi se paapi manushya ko bhi paramatma kii prapti ho sakati he
 The person who is in and under the condition, he can achieve the divine in the same situation and there itself, can do well, can get liberation

 We should take advantage of them soon
 aapane bhagwatprapti ke aise naye- naye anek sadhano kaa avishkaar kiya he
 Question- Then why did the revered Swamiji Shri Ramsukhdasji Maharaj become a sadhu? uttar- aisa prashn ek vyakti ne shri swami ji maharaj se bhi kiya tha ki aap sadhu kyon bane? In response, Shri Swamiji Maharaj said that i have not become a monk
 
 Question- Why did Mataji make you a monk? uttar-aapaki mataji bani shreshth or bhagavan kaa bhajan karne vaali thi
 You believed in the success of human life only from the Bhajan of God
 aap ram naam japti thi
 You had a lot of hymns
 anek santon kii vaani aati thi 
 You had great devotion and devotion among saints
 sant- mahatmaon par bhi asar tha ki ye mataji bane jaankaar hai
 Mother's village was Madpura
 aapke yahan jab koi sant-mahatma padhaarte, tab aap or sakhiyaan bhajan gaaya karti thi
 Once upon a time, Saint Sri Jiyaramji Maharaj should visit you
 sakhiyon ne aap se bhajan gane ke liye kaha
 You didn't sing tab kisi ne maharaj se kah diya ki ye bhajan nahin ga rahi he
 Someone said how these villages! He is a child
 tab shri jiyaaraam ji maharaj ne kaha ki raamji or denge 
 You should sing praises
 tab aapane bhajan gaaya
 When you were approached by Bhagwatkripa, he was brought and handed over to Jiyaramji Maharaj
 maharaj ne kaha ki yah balak to aap rakho
 Give it to the child this time
 tab us balak ko mataji ne apane paas main rakh liya
 After that Jiyaramji Maharaj went to Param Dham
 phir do varshon ke baad mataji ke jab doosraa balak hua or wo chaar varsh kaa ho gaya, tab usko mataji ne jiyaaraamji maharaj ke baad vaale santon ko de diya, sadhu bana diya
 The saints made him his disciple
 balak ke janm kaa naam tha sukhdev
 Then he was named - revered Swamiji Shri Ramsukhdasji Maharaj
 gurujanon ke prati aapkaa bana aadar bhav tha
 On his saying, you studied Sanskrit and learned and even took the exam till Acharya

 You liked the words of God
 gita padhanaa acha lagata tha
 You had an affair with Geeta at the age of twelve
 baad main dhyaan dene par aapako gita ji kanthsth mili, kanthsth kerani nahin padhi
 While reading, Geeta ji remembered
 aapane gita- paathshaala khol rakhi thi or aap logon ko gita padhaate the
 Sometimes new thoughts of Gita ji would come in your mind that which are not seen in the commentary of any Gita
 is prakaar or bhi kai baaten hai

 You did not let you put an umbrella on yourself even in the rain
 aap na rui ke bichhonon par baithte the or na sote the
 Neither used to sit nor sleep on the bed
 buni hui kursi par bhi aap nahin baithte the
 Before laying the posture anywhere, you used to bury that place with the air of soft posture, remove the micro-organisms from there
 bina asana ke baithte samay bhi aap jeev jantuon bachaa kar baithte the
 While walking, you used to keep in mind that no animal could die under foot
 aapkaa bana komal sheel swabhaav tha
 There was always a quality in your heart, which was visible to others
 aap hameshaa jal chaan kar hi kaam main lete the
 Filtered water was also filtered back after four or six hours; Because after four hours in the Chaturmas and six hours at other times the organisms are produced
 jal main jeev bahut chote hote hai, dikhte nahin
 That is why you used to filter the water by double the thick clothes and after careful sterilization, they used to release those organisms into the water
 is prakaar aap chaane hue jal ko kaam main lete the 
 You used to use water only after filtering water, drinking, drinking, defecation, bathing etc
 apane nirvaah ke liye kamase- kam aavashyaktaa rakhte the
 Necessary items were also limited
 paristhiti ko apane anusaar na bana kar khud ko paristhiti ke anusaar bana lete the
 He did not possess any object, person etc

 Sometimes, if a woman touched the stage by mistake, you would stop eating
 upwas rakh kar uskaa praayshchitt karte the

 shaastra main garbhpaat ko brahmahatya se bhi duguna mahapaap bataaya gaya he
 You opposed family planning, dowry and widow marriage
 vivaah se pehle var- vadhoo ke milan ko paap maanate the or iskaa nishedh karte the
 You also prohibited making a guru

 You have always tried to protect gaay ke sooyee lagaakar duhane ko aap bana paap maanate the or iskaa nishedh karte the
 You were strongly opposed to the fire of garbage

 Used to destroy the photo taken
 aap manushya kii photo ko mahatva na dekar bhagavan kii photo ko mahatva dete the or rakhane kii salaah dete the
 You gave great importance to satsang
 satsang to maano aapkaa jivan hi tha
 You used to say that as much benefit as there is from satsang, living in solitude is also not done by means
 varshon tak ekaant main rahakar saadhan karne se bhi jo laabh nahin hota he, wo laabh ek baar ke satsang se ho jaataa he 
 Perform satsang and do the means
 saadhan kare or satsang kare
 Doing this way brings great benefits
 satsang sab kii janani he
 No one can say the benefit that comes from satsang
 aap jahaan bhi virajte the vahaan nity- satsang hota tha
 The five o'clock satsang used to go on in the journey as well
 kabhi- kabhi yatra ke kaaran gani main chal rahe hote or praatah paanch baje vaali prarthana satsang kaa samay ho jaataa to gani main hi prarthana, gita-paath or satsang kar liya jaataa tha
 Satsang used to happen many times during the day
 satsang ke bina khaali din aapako pasand nahin tha
 Thus, a very good satsang continued
 


 Finally, in Samvat 2062, on the night of Ekadashi with Krishna Paksha of Ashada, after three and a half hours, after leaving the body at Gitabhavan Rishikesh, Gangatat, you reached Paramdham

 prashn- kya unki chita bhasma ko gangaji samet kar le gai? Answer- Yes, his last action was done on the banks of Gangaji
 dahkriya ke baad duusare tisare din hi gangaji itani badi ki vahaan ke chitabhasm aadi sab avshesh bahaakar apane saath main le gai
 The land there has changed
 maano gangaji bhi aise avasar ko paanaa chaahati thi
 
 mahapurushon ke vahaan se prasthaan kar jane par prakruti ne bhi apane niyam badal diye
 For two years, the fruits of mango trees stopped growing
 
 Every year, such paranas of those leaves used to be made so that they were given on general contract for sale etc
 But this time it did not look like this

 It is considered an area rich in natural beauty
 "phuket" malay bhashaa ke "bukit" shabd se utpann hua he, jiskaa arth tila yaa chota pahaad he
 From afar, the island appears as a mound

 Any disease that is caused by such a retarded immune response is called autoimmune disease
 swapratiraksha akasar lakshyit pind main jeevanapadaarth ke vikaas ko abhaav ke kaaran hoti he or is tarah pratirakshi pratikriya uski apni koshikaon or utakon ke viruddh kaary karti he 
 iske ullekhneey udaahranon main shaamil hai, celia rog, madhumeh prakaar 1 ), pranalik lupas arithematosus ), jograine kaa rogesamooh, churg-strans rogesamooh, hashimoto kaa avatushoth, grevz rog, ideopathic thrombocytopinic parpura or gathiyaroop sandhishoth )
 dekhen, swatahpratirakshak rogon kii suchi
 The misconception that a person's immune system is completely incapable of identifying its own antigens is not new
 beesvin sadi ke prarambh main paul ehralich ne horer autotoxicus kaa siddhant prastut kiya, jiske anusaar ‘saamaanya’ sharir apane swayan ke utakon ke viruddh pratirakshi pratikriya shuru nahin karata he
 In this way, any autoimmune response was considered abnormal and related to human disease
 ab yah sweekaar kar liya gaya he ki swapratirakshi pratikriyaayein prishthvanshi pratirakshak pranaaliyon kaa ek atoot hissaa hoti hai, jinhen saamanytah rog utpann karne se swatah-pratijanon ke prati pratirakshatmak sahishnutaa kii kriya dwaara roka jaataa he
 Self-defense should never be considered as separate immunity
 swapratiraksha kaa ucch str jahaan aswasthkar hota he, vahiin iskaa kam str vastav main laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 First, low-level autoimmunity helps identify the cells produced by CD8 + t cells and thus reduces the incidence of cancer
 duusare, swapratiraksha kii sankraman kii praarambhik avasthaaon main tej pratirakshi pratikriya hone dene main bhoomika ho sakati he, jis samay videshi pratijanon kii uplabdhi pratikriya ko simit karti he 
 steffanova or anya ne apane adhyayan main, sidi4+ tii koshika-emechasi antarkriya ko asthaayee rup se rokane ke liye emechasi varg II anu ke ekal prakaar ko vyakt karne vaale ek prati-emechasi varg II pratipind kaa injection chuhon ko diya
 prati-emechasi dene ke 36 ghanton baad in chuhon se praapt anubhavheen sidi4+ tii koshikaon main pratijan kabutar ke cytochrome si peptid ke prati pratikriya main kami dekhi gai, jiskaa nishchay zap-70 phophorilikaran, prafalan or interlukin-2 ke utpaadan se kiya gaya tha
 In this way Stefanova maintains the reactivity of CD4 + t cells in the absence of other foreign antigens
 swapratiraksha kaa yah vichaar saidhantik rup se ladaai ke khel jaisaa he
 Lion's children and automhc) fighting games can cause minor scratches or bruises, but in the long run it proves beneficial, as it prepares the lion's child to fight well in the future

 This breakdown causes the immune system to initiate an effective and specific immune response against the adjuvant
 pratirakshi sahishnutaa kii sahi utpatti abhi tak gyaat nahin he, lekin iske mul kaa varnan karne ke liye madhya-beesvin sadi se kai siddant prastut kiye gaye hai
 Three hypotheses have caught the attention of immunologists extensively: inke alaava do anya siddanton kaa gahan adhyayan jari he: Tolerance can also be divided into 'central' and 'periodic' tolerances, depending on whether or not the above methods of testing work in the central lymphoid components or periodic lymphoid components
 is baat par jor dena chaiye ki ye siddant paraspar anany nahin hai or is baat ke adhikadhik sanket mil rahe hai ki ye sabhi prakriyaayein prishthvanshi pratirakshak sahishnutaa main sakriy rup se bhaag le sakati hai
 Loss of tolerance is a confounding feature in voluntary human autoimmunity, which is almost entirely limited to autoantibody responses produced by B
 lymphocytes
 tii koshikaon main sahishnutaa ke lop ko darshana atyant hi kathin he or jahaan kahin bhi asaamaanya tii koshika pratikriya kaa saboot uplabdh he, vah saamanyatya swapratipindon dwaara pahachaane gaye pratijanon ke prati nahin hoti he
 In this way, autoantibodies to igg Fc are found in bovine vata, but there does not appear to be a corresponding t cell response
 Systemic lupus has autoantibodies to DNA, which cannot induce t cell responses, and limited evidence of t cells responses to nucleoprotein antigens is found guilty
 celia rog main utak transglutaminez ke prati swapratipind hote hai, lekin tii koshika pratikriya videshi pratijan glayadin ke prati hoti he
 This disparity has led to the idea that human autoimmune disease is in most cases based on the omission of b cell tolerance, which uses normal t cell responses against foreign antigens in a variety of misguided ways
 kuch logon main swapratirakshi rog hone kii jananik rup se atisamvedansheeltaa hoti he
 This hypersensitivity is associated with many genes and other risk factors
 jananik rup se samvedansheel logon main swapratirakshi rog sadaiv hi viksit nahin hote hai
 Three main sets of genes are suspected in many autoimmune diseases
 ye jine nimna se sambandhit hai: The first two, which participate in the recognition of antigens, are innately variable and susceptible to recombination
 ye parivartan pratirakshi tantra ko atyant vividh prakaar ke aakraamakon ke prati pratikriya karne kii kshamta pradaan karte hai, kintu saath hi swa-pratikriya karne kii kshamta vaali lasikakoshikaayen bhi utpann kar sakate hai

 dwipaksheeya rajnay kaa taatpary he - 'do pakshon ke madhya sambandh'
 Diplomacy between two states is called bilateral diplomacy
 rajnay ke dwaara do rajyon ke bich kii samasyaon ko hal kiya jaataa he
 If national problems are complex, then solutions can be resolved by a conference between the two states
 rajnay kaa saamaanya, saral tathaa sidh maarg yah he ki videsh vibhaag tathaa inke dwaara niyukt rajdoot samasyaon ke samaadhaan aapas main baatcheet dwaara kar lete hai
 In this way, the relations of the states keep going smoothly
 rajyon ke madhya parsparik vyaktigat sampark donon ke madhya sambandhon ko madhur banaata he
 Diplomatic relations between states have been in place since time immemorial
 ye utane hi pracheen hai jitne kii rajya
 In ancient times, when there were differences between the states, the representatives of the two countries found a solution to the problem and tried to end the differences
 aadhunik yug main bhi aisa hi kiya jaataa he or ise dwipaksheeya rajnay kaa naam diya gaya he
 Before the First World War, only smart, capable and efficient ambassadors made relations between the states
 rajyon ke madhya matbhedon athwa samasyaon ko dur karne ke liye kai baar do rajyon ke rajdhyaksh swayan baatcheet kar lete the
 The “simla Agreement” of 1970 is an example of this
 yah samjhauta bharat dwipaksheeya evam bahupaksheeya rajnay, sthaayee mishan : kaary evam bhoomika 201 or pakistan ke madhya hua tha
 The agreement was signed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on behalf of India and President Mr
 Bhutto on behalf of Pakistan
 isi prakaar sheet yuddh kii samaapti karne ke liye america tathaa rus kii dwipaksheeya vaarta dwaara yah sambhav hua
 The biggest argument in support of bilateral diplomacy is that the Head of State or Prime Minister can reach out to solve the problem at any place
 kai vidwaan iske vishay main bhi tark dete hai ki dwipaksheeya vaarta se samasya kaa hal nahin ho paata balki samasya or badhati he
 The noted 15th-century ambassador Philip D
 Comines said that "two kings who want to establish a sweet personal relationship should not meet each other directly
" vyaktigat pratyaksh vaarta main is baat kaa char rahata he ki rajdhyaksh kahin ek duusare ke virdohi na ho jaayen
 Henry VIII and Charles v started hating each other due to bilateral diplomacy
 dwipaksheeya rajnay kaa upbhog kabhi-kabhi praachaar ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation it becomes a means of victory in the hands of an ambitious leader and not the basis of a just agreement
 praayah yah dekha gaya he ki is prakaar kii vaarta main na to nirnay puure liye jate hai or jo nirnay liye jate hai unhen samay kii kami ke kaaran unako adhinsth adhikariyon par chhod diya jaataa he
 This is one of the reasons why Russia and America could not have good relations
 dwipaksheeya rajnay dwaara kabhi-kabhi vyaktigat sampark se do deshon ke madhya maitri sambandh drudh ho jate hai
 Direct and quick decisions can be taken by this type of conference which is appropriate to solve the problem of that time
 yadi nirnay nahin bhi liye jate to rajanyik pratyanon se samjhaute kaa rup le saktaa he
 a bilateral conference is a good tool to understand international problems well, to understand one's own and others' perspectives
 iske madhyam se lokapriyata bhi praapt kii ja sakati he
 a drawback of bilateral diplomacy is that decisions are taken quickly by it, which lacks complete and mature ideas
 har paksh apni suvidhanusaar in nirnyon kaa alag-alag matlab lagaataa he
 Their decision is also avoided in implementation
 aaj ke kisi bhi ati vyast rajdhyaksh ke paas itnaa samay nahin hota ki vah jatil samasyaon ko samaj sake
 The result is that such conferences fail
 nehru-liyakat pact ek aisa hi sammelan tha jiske parinamswaroop bharat-paak ke sambandh madhur hone ke bajaay bigade
 Even in the 1960 Paris conference, relations between Russia and the US deteriorated instead of being friendly
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke baad dwipaksheeya rajnay kaa aaj ke yug main mahatv kam hota ja rahaa he
 It has now been replaced by multilateral diplomacy

 Kilimanjaro Mountains is the highest free-standing mountain in the world as well as the fourth highest emerged mountain in the world which is 5,882 meters or 19,298 feet high from the base
 kilimanjaro naam kaa sateek arth or utpatti agyaat he
 It is believed to be a combination of the Swahili word Kilima and the Kichaga word Jaro, which translates to "whitewashed", from which the name White Mountain originated
 Another belief is that "jaro" in Chaga / Kichaga means 'our' and therefore Kilimanjaro means our mountain
 It is derived from the Chaga residents who live at the foothills of this mountain
 yah agyaat he ki kilimanjaro naam kahaan se aayaa he, lekin kai siddhant maujuud hai
 European explorers adopted the name by 1860 and stated that it was its Swahili name, and Kilimanjaro is divided into two parts, one is Kilima and the other is Jaro whose origin varies according to the principles - some people According to it is an ancient Swahili word meaning white or glow, or according to non-swahili origin it came from the Kichaga language, the word Jaro means "caravan"
 The problem with all of this is that they cannot explain why the term redundant kilima has been used instead of millima, the proper term for the mountain
 yah naam ek sthaneey hansi-mazaaq kaa hissaa ho saktaa he, jo "jaaro kii choti pahari" ko africa mahadweep kaa sabase bada pahaad sanderbhit karata he, kyonki yah paas kaa shahar he or guide bataate hai ki yah jaaro logon kii pahari he
 In a different view it is believed that it comes from Kichaga Kilmanare or Kiliajo which means "one who defeats birds / leopards / caravans"
 But this theory does not explain the fact that Kilimanjaro in Kitchaga was not used before in Europe in the mid-19th century
 1880 ke dashak main, yah parvat, jisaki german vartanee swahili naam ke ghatakon ke anusaar us samay kilima-ndscharo thi, german purv africa kaa ek hissaa ban gaya jab karl peters ne sthaneey mukhiyaaon ko sandhiyon par hastakshar karne ke liye manaaya 
 1889 main kibo shikhar kaa naam hanse mayer dwaara "kaisar-wilhem-spitje" rakhaa gaya, jab is shikhar par 5 oktober 1889 ko pehali baar chadhaai kii gai
 The name was used until 1918, when German colonies were given to the British Empire after World War I
 jab british prashasit tanganyika ko 1961 main apni swatantraaa praapt hui, to is shikhar kaa naam "uhuru shikhar" rakhaa gaya, jiskaa swahili main arth hota he "swatantraaa shikhar"
 The key-prefix has many underlying meanings in Swahili
 pracheen kaa-alparthak sangya upsarg ko, kii varg ke saath vilay kar diya gaya
 It has another meaning under which it describes anything unique: Kilima, a single peak, unlike Milima, which describes more of a mountain range or uneven country
 kai anya parvaton main bhi yah upsarg laga hua he, jaise ki kilima bogo jo kenya main nairobi ke bilkul uttar main sthit he
 People with disabilities are also placed in the same category, which is not that much of a diminutive idea; Rather a unique situation in which they are: a blind or deaf person, Kipofu and Kiziwi
 This prefix "ki-" does not imply derogatory meaning in any way

 Over the years, various maps with many other properties have become available

 There are six official climbing routes through which Mount Kilimanjaro can be climbed, their names are: Marangue, Rongai, Lemosho, Shira, Umbwe and Machame
 Of all the routes, Machame is quite panoramic, though its climb up the mountain is quite steep, which can be completed in six or seven days
 rongai sabase aasaan shivi maarg he or marangu bhi apekshaakrit aasaan he, lekin awaas jhopadiyon main hota he
 As a result, this route becomes very busy and the ascent and descent route is the same

 Although this climb is not technically as challenging as climbing the summit of the Himalayas, the high altitude, low temperatures and occasional strong winds make it a difficult and dangerous climb

 Tanzanian medical services around the mountain have recently expressed concern over the growing influx of tourists who consider Kilimanjaro apparently an easy climb

 Kilimanjaro National Park shows that only 30% of climbers actually reach the Uhru summit while most climbers return 300 meters below Uhru, at Gilman Point or 200 meters below Uhuru from Stella Point
 kilimanjaro ko aksar kam aanka jaataa he kyonki yah ek takneekee chadhaai nahin he
 However, many climbers consider Kilimanjaro to be physically very difficult climbs

 The majority of these dead are wearers who are killed by hypothermia
 parvatarohi pahaad kii khadi dhaalon se gir jate hai or chattaanon kii skhalan ne bhi parvatarohiyon kii jaan lee he
 For this reason, the route passing the Arrow Glacier was closed for several years

 The low level of endemism at Kilimanjaro can lead to the destruction of low altitude forests, not the relatively young age of the mountains
 Another feature of Kilimanjaro's forests is the lack of bamboo area, which is present on all other high mountains with high rainfall, similar to East Africa

 These killers on Kilimanjaro are found on the northern slope, where the area is dry for a long bamboo field

 In microeconomics, the law of demand states that, "keeping all other aspects equal, the fall of the prices of a commodity: increases its demand; and the lifting of the prices of a commodity: drops its demand
" " duusare shabdon main, maang kaa kanoon mulya or maatra ke bich ek vyutkram sambandh kaa varnan karata he jo kii kisi vastu ke liye hota he
 The price of the commodity and the price of the consumer's income are considered permanent
 haalanki, maang ke kanoon ke kuch sambhavit apwaad hai, jaise ki gifen vasteen or viblen vasteen
 The statute of demand, under mathematical expression, shows the inverse relationship between the price of a given commodity and its quantity, in the same way; Q{x} = f (p{x};aanshik P_ {x} <0,} The above equation shows that, when the demand for goods is on the x-axis and the price is on the y-axis, both a increases or decreases a demand curve, also known as a demand schedule
 ek saamaanya maang vakr ke neeche kii dhalaan prakruti, maatra kii maang or keemat ke bich vyutkram sambandh ko darshaati he
 Therefore, the downward sloping demand curve reflects the law of demand
 dhyaan den ki "maang" or "maang kii gai maatra" kaa arth aarthik shabdaganan main alag-alag baaten karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 On one hand, "demand" refers to the entire demand curve, which is the relationship between quantity demanded and price
 maang main parivartan kii maang vakr main ek badlaav se graphic rup se darshaya gaya he
 On the other hand, "quantity demanded" refers to the quantity consumers want the price given, conditional to the other determinants
 maang vakr ke saath ek andolan dwaara "maatra kii maang main parivartan" graphic rup se darshaya gaya he
 Generally, the demand for a commodity increases when the price of that commodity falls and vice versa, as the price increases, the amount demanded for the commodity falls
 kuch maamalon main, haalanki, yah sach nahin ho saktaa he aise kuch saamaan hai jo is kanoon kaa paalan nahin karte hai
 These include more Giffen goods
 Exceptions and descriptions are given in the sections below
 shuru main sar 'robert gifan' dwaara prastaavit, arthshaastri bazaar main giffen vastuon ke astitv se asahmat the
 a Giffen item describes a low commodity as one whose price increases, demand for the product increases
 udhaaharan ke taur par, 19veen shatabdi ke irish batata akaal ke dauraan, aalu ko giffphen vastu mana jaataa tha aalu irish aahaar main sabase bada stepal the, isliye keemat badhane ke kaaran aay par bada prabhaav padaa
 People responded by cutting luxury items such as meat and vegetables and bought more potatoes in return
 isliye, jaisaa ki aalu kii keemat main vruddhi hui he, isliye maatra kii maang kii gai
 If an increase in the price of a commodity causes one to expect a further increase in the price of a commodity, they may begin to buy more and more of the item at the present increased price
 isi tarah, agar kisi vastu kii keemat main kami kii ummid he, to vah apni kharid ko sthagit kar saktaa he
 Thus, some argue that the law of demand is violated in such cases
 is maamle main, maang kii avasthaa baayen se daaen neeche dhalaan nahin karti; iske badale yah upar se neeche kii ore se neeche kii ore ek pichde dhalaan ko prastut karata he yah vakr ek asaadhaaran maang vakr ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Medicines covered by insurance are a good example of how important basic or essential items are for people who need to be priced
 aise achche mulya kii keemat main vruddhi yaa kami se isaki maatra kii maang nahin hoti he
 These goods are not fully correlated, as any change in price does not change the quantity demanded

 Indra Botany gandhiji kii janmabhumi porbandar main san 1849 janme or vanaspati shaastra ke mahaan vidwaan kaa naam tha jaikrishna indraji thaakar
 Due to not being able to fill the school's eight coming fees, they were able to study up to class three through English medium, because the fee for class 4 was 1 rupee per month, which was difficult for Indra
 maatr kaksha teen tak pard pane vaale indra ji ko dow bhagwaan laal indraji kaa sanidhya milte hi unhone indraji ke andar chupe vidwaan ko pahchaan liya or unheen kii madad se indra ji vanaspati shaastra ke mahapandit bane
 Indra first wrote a Gujarati book on botany in 1910 called "botany"
 is pustak ko dekh kar us samay ke angrej vidwaan chaunk gaye or unhone indraji se is pustak ko angreji main likhane kaa aagrah kiya tab unka uttar tha: You British can identify the vegetation that originates in any province of India, you also write a book on the flora of India, but we do not recognize the vegetation that grows in our country; The method by which you recognize the vegetation of the world, i want to tell that method to my countrymen, so i have decided to write this book in Gujarati itself
 755 prishth kii or 10rupee mulya kii is pustak main indra ji ne lagbhag 611 vanaspatiyon kaa varnan, vanaspati ko pahchaanane ke tareeke saath hi gujarati shloke or dohe kavitaaon ke madhyam se vanaspati ke upyog kaa vistrut varnan kiya tha
 By reading this book, Gandhiji used neem as a medicine during his Africa stay
 par afsos ki apni patni ke gahane girvee rakh kar yah pustak prakashit karwaane ke baad bhi yah pustak itani nahin bik pai
 That is, almost 17 years passed in selling the first iteration of the book, but Indraji was not disappointed and with the request and support of the Maharaja of Kutch, he wrote another book called "kutch ni herbs"
 is pustak main indraji ne lagbhag 100 jadi bootiyon kaa sachitr parichay diya tha
 At that time, books of botany were not kept in the category of literature due to which this book also did not become so famous, but His Majesty Pt
 Madan Mohan Malviya of Banaras Hindu World School invited Indra Ji to visit Kashi and Help in botany
 ” main bada ahsaan maanoonga yadi aap kripaakar yahan aawein or vidwaanon kii mandali main kaashi vaas kaa sukh anubhav karen or ayurveda ke uddhaar or unnati main sahaayta pahunchaane ke liye vanaspati vanambhotenichal Garden banane main sanmati or sahaayta den
 But due to old age, Indraji could not accept the proposal of Pt
 Madan Mohan Malaviya and wrote: “ab yah sharir 76 varsh kaa jeern hua he, karn badhir hua he, munh main ek daant shesh rahaa he
 After wandering in the jungle for years, the waist is also sticking up



 After the Deepotsav, if there is a health, then at one time, you will be thankful after visiting the botanical forest in the Ayurvedic Department of Banaras University

 While many FM radio stations primarily in Europe provide an additional unencrypted satellite feed, there are also subscription-based digital packages of many channels that do not broadcast locally, with the US being notable
 europe main, kai aapurtikartaaon dwaara efem radio istemaal kiya jaataa he jisamen kai sthaneey efem punaravartak vrihad kshetra main, aamtaur par puure desh main ek ekal kaarykram ke prasaaran ke liye ek network kaa prayog karte hai
 Many of them have an additional satellite signal that can be heard in many parts of the continent
 iske vipareet, america sthaliy stesan hameshaa sthaneey hote hai or unamem se har ek ke paas anoothaa kaarykram hota he, haalanki ve kabhi-kabhi sindicated saamagree ke liye jude rahete hai, lekin phir bhi prayek sthaneey stesan ke paas apane swayan ke vanijyik or samachar antaraal hote hai
 This means that the national distribution of the contents of the original local stations via satellite has no real meaning in the US, so satellite radio is used in a different way
 sirius, exem or worldspes jaisi mobile sevaayen, shrotaaon ko samast mahadweep main kahin bhi ghoomane or jahaan kahin ve jaaen usee shravy kaarykram ko sunne kii suvidha pradaan karti hai
 Other services such as Music Choice or Muzac's satellite-distributed content require a fixed location receiver and dish antennas
 sabhi maamalon main, antena kaa spasht chitra satlite ko dikhnaa chahie
 jin kshetron main oonche bhawan, pul, yaa parking garrej sanketon ko aspasht kar dete hai, vahaan shrotaaon tak signal pahunchane ke liye punaravartakon ko sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 Radio services are generally provided by commercial enterprises and are fee-based

 Providers generally provide a variety of news, weather, sports and music channels, etc
, along with ad-free music channels

 Thus in the UK and some other countries, the contemporary development of radio services focuses on digital audio broadcasting services or HD radio instead of satellite radio

 Compared to older line rivals such as Music, satellite radio has become a very attractive option due to its significantly lower price, commercial free channel variety and more reliable technology

 Broadcast translators are able to provide local repeater signal similar to boosters even if satellite observation is blocked, for example in a large city skyscraper
 pramukh surang main bhi punaravartak ho sakate hai
 This method also allows local programming to be broadcast in major metropolitan areas in traffic and weather, as of March 2004
 prayek resiver main isaki pahchaan karne ke liye ek electronic serial number radio idi hota he
 When an entity becomes active with a subscription, an authorization code is sent to a digital stream allowing the receiver to access blocked channels

 This table applies mainly to the United States

 Some channels have CD quality audio and others use low-bandwidth suitable audio for speech
 tab se bandwidth kii ek nishchit maatra license ke bheetar uplabdh he or adhik channelon ko jodne kaa matlab he ki kuch channelon kii gunvattta ko kam kiya janaa chahie
 aavriti pratikriya or satlite channelon ke gatisheel range donon se adhikansh, se behatar ho sakate hai, lekin sabhi eem yaa efem radio stesan nahin kyonki adhikansh eem or efem stesan ucch dhwani ke liye audio ko clip karte hai; yahaan tak ki sabase kharaab channel adhikansh channelon se phir bhi behatar hote hai, lekin kuch eem tunurs sarvshereshth efem yaa satlite prasaaran se behatar hote hai jab ve ek sthaneey stesan main parivartit ho jate hai, yahaan tak ki stirio kii kshamta nahin hone par bhi

 3 Some satellite radio services and DTR services act as an iterative repeater for local AM / FM stations, thus being a feature of high frequency of interruptions
 4 gaiyr laabh stesan or sibisi / radio- canada or enpiaar jaise saarvajanik radio network or piarai-sambaddh stesan or bibisi vanijyik-mukt hai

 vastav main, aapako keval headphone ko plag-in karnaa hota he or aasaani se aap ise sun sakate hai or ise kahin bhi le ja sakate hai
 However, it can be a little difficult to receive signals due to the clinging of buildings and trees and sometimes because of your body also depending on which side you place it and how you move it

 Following a merger in July 2008, Sirius XM Radio, a holding company in the United States and Canada, operates two satellite radio services
 donon sevaaon ke liye ek masik shulk lagu kiya jaataa he 
 kuch exem sangeet channelon vigyaapan hote hai jabaki sirius vigyaapan-mukt hota he
 Both services have an ad-free music station as well as conversation and news stations, some of which include advertisements
 exem, do sthanon se nishchit-sthaan jeeosteshnari satlite kaa istemaal karata he or sirius digital stream kaa prasaaran karne ke liye atyant andakar netrakotor uttar or dakshin america main paarit karte hue teen jeeyosincronas sataliton kaa upyog karata he
 The net difference is that the Sirius signal comes from a higher elevation angle in the northern part of the United States and even more Sirius in Canada
 donon sevaayen mukhya rup se automobile main portable resiver ke madhyam se uplabdh hai, lekin donon main kai sahaayak upkaran hote hai isiilie koi bhi portable boombox ke saath home stirio ke madhyam se sun saktaa he, yaa vyaktigat computer ke madhyam se online bhi sun saktaa he
 Both services have some form of receiver that is fully portable
 satellite radio kii pramukh parisampatti yah he ki vah sthaneey nahin hoti he: driver seva ke padchihn main kahin bhi ek hi programing praapt kar sakate hai
 a stop at a truck stop would demonstrate the popularity of Sirius XM among long-hole drivers
 In addition, both XM and Sirius receive programming that is not possible to receive only on commercial radio stations
 vishesh stesan pariwarik vaartalap, radio naatak, shastreey sangeet or live events jaise kaaryakramon ko prastut karte hai
 The footprint of both Sirius and XM is only the upper third of the United States, Canada, Mexico; It does not cover air as the satellite TV does
 29 july 2008 tak sirius exem ne 18
5 million se bhi adhik graahakon kaa daawa kiya
 An important factor in the success of satellite radio is the deployment of receivers in the car
 sirius exem ne apane resiver ke saath vaahan taiyaar karne ke liye auto nirmaataaon ko manaane kaa prayaas kiya he
 As of 2008, the following manufacturers offered satellite radios as original equipment: 2007 se lekar 2012 tak sirius kaa vidbalu or audi vaahanon ke liye vishesh anubandh he
 Those brands previously offered both services
 jiem, honda or sujuki sabhi exem ke pramukh niveshak hai; unke vaahan main vikalp ke rup sirius kii peshkash nahin he
 Bentley and rolls-royce came not only with the receiver but with lifetime membership for Sirius service
 Specialized motorcycle models from harley-davidson feature the XM, while Sirius can be heard in many brands of recreational vehicles and boats
 satlite radio ke liye ek chunauti kaaron se nikal kar upabhoktaaon ke gharon tak pahunchnaa tha
 Many portable satellite radio receivers were built for this purpose
 XM Satellite Radio developed the xm2go line of "walkman-like" portable receivers, such as Delphi mayfi, Pioneer Airware and Giants International's Tao
 Polk Audio with XM capability makes the i-sonic a component-style home XM reference tuner and a tabletop entertainment system
 sirius ne kenwood portable satellite radio tuner, sirius S50, hiyar2anivair or sirius stellato 100 kaa vikaas kiya
 Pioneer Inno and Samsung Helix for XM were among the first portable receivers to offer the ability to record live events for later listening
 is prakaar yah empi 3 players ke saath pratispardhaa karne ke liye satlite radio ko anumati detaa he
 While significant agreements were still being made with automakers, the two companies only jumped away from satellite radios in the car and reached consumers' homes
 sadak main ek bamp se ghar main adhik vyapak rup se istemaal kiya jane laga or donon sirius or exem 2006 ke armbh main aantarik efem transmeter ke bare main kanoonee muddon main apane epasisi ke saath chal rahaa he
 This required Sirius and XM to take many of their models off the shelf and solve the problem
 epasisi daawa karata tha ki aantarik efem transmeter kaa utsarjan bahut shaktishaalee tha or nune karne kii aavashyaktaa thi
 With these changes, any customer purchasing a new satellite radio receiver does not receive the same distance as the old model
 chunki ghar main ek satlite radio kaa istemaal karne kii kshamta kaa yah ek mukhya bindu he inke chalate kai graahak ek atirikt vyaktigat efem transmeter ke istemaal karne kii ore unmukh hue jaise hole house efem transmeter, si
 kraine company, griffine technology aadi
 isane nune shakti vaale aantarik efem transmeter ko sthanantarit kiya
 Since these external FM transmitters have been part 15 compliant and can transmit signals more than the new internal FM transmitter included in satellite radio, it is still legal
 yah bahari efem transmeter sirius or exem radio ke liye upabhokta ghar bazaar main pahunchi satlite radio kii pragati main dhimepan ko roak saktaa he
 Satellite radio technology was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology of Fame in 2002

 The first two would use a similar system that was setup for the US, while the application of CHUM was for a subscription radio service via an existing terrestrial DAB transmitter rather than broadcasting directly from the satellite
 The CHUM service is Canadian in all respects, with the other two applications offering a mix of Canadian-produced channels and existing channels from their US partners
