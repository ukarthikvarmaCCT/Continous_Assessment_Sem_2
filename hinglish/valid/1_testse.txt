 prabhaat prakaashan nai dilli ne devendra swaroop kii nimna pustaken prakashit kii hai: Occasional thinking on the country and times under the pretext of Devendra ji's books, Accessed date: 3 January 2014 panzia, panjeya yaa panji, ek vishaal ekikrut mahadweep tha jiskaa astitv lagbhag 250 million varsh pehle peliojoik or mizozoik yug ke dauraan tha; maujuuda mahadweep apane vartmaan swaroop main isi main se nikal kar aaye hai
 The name was coined in the scientific discussion of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental flow
 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1
8 GA
 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar
 pracheenatam ordovisian main 480 eme ke aasapaas evalonia kaa chota mahadweep, ek jameen kaa hissaa jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america, nova scotia or england bana, gondvanaa se mukt ho gaya or isane laurenshia kii ore apana safar shuru kar diya
 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
 Meanwhile southern Europe fragmented from Gondwana and the newly formed rake began to move across the ocean towards Euramerica and collided with the southern Baltic in the Devonian, although this small continent was in the form of an underwater strip
 ipitas mahaasaagar kii shakha khantee mahaasaagar bhi siberia se ek dweepiya vrutt ke rup main sikud rahaa tha jo purvi baltic se takaraa gaya
 a new ocean, the Ural Ocean, was present behind this island
 silurian kaal ke ant main uttar or dakshin china gondvanaa se dur chale gaye or sikudte hue proto-tethis mahaasaagar ke paar uttar kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or iske dakshini sire par nayaa peleo-tethis mahaasaagar khul rahaa tha
 In the Devonian period, Gondwana itself started moving towards Euramerica, causing the Rake Ocean to shrink
 praarambhik carbonipheras yug main uttar-pashchim africa ne uramerica ke dakshin-purvi tat ko chhu liya tha jisase epalchian parvaton or messeta parvaton ke dakshini hisson kaa nirmaan hona shuru ho gaya tha
 South America moved northward towards southern Euramerica while the eastern parts of Gondwana started moving from the equator to the south pole
 uttari china or dakshini china swatantra mahadwipon par sthit the
 The small continent Kazakhstania collided with Siberia in the Middle Carboniferous era
 pashchimi kazakhstania carbonipheras yug ke ant main baltic se takaraayaa jisase unke bich ural mahaasaagar kaa sampark band ho gaya karne or unamem pashchimi proto-tethis ural parvaton or vishaal mahadweep loresia kii utpatti kaa kaaran bana
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa antim charan tha
 Meanwhile, South America collided with southern Laurentia, closing the rake ocean and forming the southernmost part of the Appalachians and Ouachita Mountains
 is samay tak gondvanaa dakshini dhruv ke paas sthit ho gaya tha or antarctic, bharat, australia, dakshin africa or dakshin america main glaciaron kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Part of northern China had collided with Siberia by the end of the Carboniferous era and thus the proto-tethys Ocean was completely closed
 parmian yug kii shuruyaat main cimerian plate gondvanaa se vikhandit hokar alag ho gayi or yah loresia kii ore badhane lagi jisase iske dakshini sire par ek nayaa mahaasaagar, tethis mahaasaagar nirmit ho gaya or plato-tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya
 Most of the terrain was still integrated
 trysic kaal main panzia thodaa sa dakshin-pashchim disha main gum gaya tha
 The Cimmerian plate was still crossing the shrinking paleo-tethys which continued until the middle of the Jurassic period
 The paleo-tethys was closed from west to east, thus creating the Cimmerian Orogeny
 panzia angreji ke "si " akshar kii tarah dikhaai detaa tha jisamen si ke andar ek mahaasaagar, nayaa tethis mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Pangea had cracked by the middle of the Jurassic period, its fragmentation is given below
 panzia ke jeevashm-pramaan main mahadwipon par paayi jane vaali ek jaisi or abhinn prajatiyon kii maujuudagi shaamil he jo ab kaaphi dur chale gaye hai
 For example, fossils of therapsid Listerosaurus are found in South Africa, India and Australia, along with members of the Glossopteris flora that would have extended from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their current positions; Similarly, the freshwater reptile Mizosaurus is found only in the local areas of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa
 panzia ke atirikt pramaan dakshin america ke purvi tat or africa ke pashchimi tat ke bich bhuvaigyanik rujhaanon ke milan sahit isse sate mahadwipon ke bhugarbha main paae jate hai
 The polar ice layer of the Carboniferous period covered the southern end of Pangea
 visheshkar ek hi yug tak kii himandiyon ke sangrah or sanrachanaayen kai alag mahadwipon par paayi jaati hai jo panzia mahadweep main ek saath rahe honge
 Paleomagnetic studies of apparent pathways of polar aberration also support the theory of giant-continent
 bhuvaigyanik chattaanon main chumbakeey khanijon ke unmukhikaran kaa pareekshan kar mahadwipiya platon kii halchal ko nirdhaarit kar sakate hai; jab chattaanon kaa nirmaan hota he, ve prithvi ke chumbakeey gunon ko apane andar samahit kar lete hai or yah sanket dete hai ki chattan ke saapeksh dhruv kis disha main maujuud hai
 Since the magnetic poles tilt toward recurring poles occur only over a period of a few thousand years, measurements are averaged over several lavas of several thousand years to determine a clear average polarity position
 talchhati chattaanon or ghuspaithi aagney chattaanon ke namoonon main ek chumbakeey jhukaav hota he jo aam taur par chumbakeey uttar ke jhukaav main in 'ek saamaan badlaavon' kaa ek ausat hota he kyonki unke chumbakeey kshetra turant nahin ban jate hai jaisaa ki thande ho rahe lava ke maamle main hota he
 The magnetic variations between sample groups that have a difference of millions of years in age are due to a combined real polarity deviation and movement of continents
 vaastavik dhruviya vichlan ke ghatak sabhi namoonon ke liye samaan hote hai or inhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 This gives geologists a part of this drift that shows continental stirring and can be used to help redefine earlier continental conditions
 parvat shrinkhalaaon kii nirantarata bhi panzia ke liye sakshya uplabdh karaate hai
 An example of this is the Appalachian mountain range that extends from the northeastern United States to the Caledonides of Ireland, Britain, Greenland, and Scandinavia
 panzia ke vikhandan ke teen pramukh charan the
 The first phase began in the Early – Middle Jurassic period when Pangea began to diverge from the Tethys Ocean in the east and the Pacific Ocean in the west, eventually leading to the development of the vast continents Lauresia and Gondwana
 jo daraar uttari america or africa ke bich bananaa shuru hua tha usne kai asafal daraaron ko janm diya
 ek daraar ke parinaam swaroop nae mahaasaagar, uttar atlantic mahaasaagar kaa nirmaan hua
 The Atlantic Ocean was not uniformly open; Rifts began to form in the north-central Atlantic
 dakshin atlantic kriteshs tak nahin khulaa tha
 Lauresia started moving clockwise, it moved north to North America and south to Eurasia
 loresia ke ghadi kii disha main badhane se tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta bhi band ho gaya
 In the meantime a new rift had also begun to form on the other side of Africa with the adjacent margins of East Africa, Antarctica and Madagascar leading to the creation of the southwestern Indian Ocean, also opening up in the Cretaceous
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa doosraa mahatvapurn charan praarambhik criteshas kaal main shuru hua jab chota vishaal mahadweep gondvanaa anekon mahadwipon main alag-alag vibhakt ho gaya
 Around 200 MA, the Simaria continent collided with Eurasia as described above
 However, a subduction zone was created when Cimaria collided
 is sabadakshan kshetra ko tethian trench kaha gaya tha
 This sea trench was probably subducted as the Tethyan mid-ocean Ridge, this ridge responsible for the expansion of the Tethys Ocean
 yah sambhawatah africa, bharat or australia ke uttar kii ore badhane kaa kaaran bana tha
 In the early Cretaceous period, the Atlantic, which is today's South America and Africa, was eventually separated from eastern Gondwana, opening the way to the "south Indian Ocean"
 madhya kriteshs kaal main gondvanaa ne vikhandit hokar dakshin atlantic mahaasaagar kaa maarg khol diya tha kyonki dakshin america ne africa se dur pashchim kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya tha
 The South Atlantic was not uniformly developed; Rather it formed as a crack from north to south
 iske alaava usee dauraan madagascar or bharat antarctic se alag hone lage the or uttar kii ore badhane lage the, jisase hind mahaasaagar kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 Madagascar and India separated from each other in the 100–90 MA at the end of the Cretaceous period
 bharat 15 centimetre prati varsh kii gati se uresia kii ore uttar disha main badhata rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band kar diya jabaki madagascar vahiin thahar gaya tha or africa plate main sthir ho gaya tha
 The remainder of New Zealand, New Caledonia and Zealandia began to diverge from Australia and was moving eastward towards the Pacific and opened the way to the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa teesraa mahatvapurn or antim charan praarambhik sinojoik yug main puraa hua
 Lauresia was separated when North America / Greenland was liberated from Eurasia and in about 60–55 MA it opened the Norwegian Sea
 The Atlantic and Indian Ocean continued to expand and the Tethys Ocean's route was closed
 isi bich australia antarctic se vibhajit ho gaya or teji se uttar kii ore bad gaya, thik usee tarah jaisaa 40 million se adhik varsh pehle bharat ne kiya tha or vartmaan main yah purvi asia ke saath ek takkar kii sthiti main he
 Both Australia and India are currently growing in the northeast direction at a speed of 5-6 centimeters per year
 takreeban 280 eme main panzia kii utpatti ke baad se antarctic dakshin dhruv main yaa iske paas rahaa he
 India collided with Asia at the beginning of about 35 MA which led to the formation of the Himalayan orogeny and the Tethys seaway was eventually closed; This collision continues even today
 africa plate ne pashchim se uttar-pashchim tak europe kii ore apni dishaao ko badalanaa shuru kar diya tha or dakshin america uttar kii disha main badhane laga tha, jisase yah antarctic se alag ho gaya or pehali baar antarctic ke aasapaas sampurna samudri parisancharan shuru ho gaya, jiske kaaran mahadweep teji se thanda hone laga or himandiyon kaa nirmaan hone laga
 sinojoik yug ke dauraan hone vaali anya mahatvapurn ghatnaon main california kii khadi kaa khulanaa, alps kaa utthan or japani samudr kaa bananaa shaamil tha
 The fragmentation of Pangea in the Great Rift Valley continues to this day

 Studies by neurological psychological tests and brain modeling techniques such as fmri and PET to test for functional differences in brain function have shown that differences are mostly found in the frontal / anterior part of the brain, hippocampus, and temporal parts

 Specific attention has been focused on the functioning of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain

 This concept also confirms the fact that amphetamines, which increase the secretion of dopamine, can worsen psychiatric symptoms in the event of schizophrenia
 ek prabhavali avadharana, jise sizophrenia kaa dopamine sidghant bhi kehete hai, ke anusaar D2 abhigrahakon kaa atyadhik sakriy hona sizophrenia kaa kaaran hota he

 The fact that glutamate receptors are less effective means that the tests to detect the function of the frontal / forebrain and hippocampal are not accurate, and that glutamate affects the functioning of dopamine, all of these in schizophrenia
 , Which has been shown to be an important mediator in the role of glutamate pathways in schizophrenia

 However, according to these studies, the average change in volume is close to the measurement range set by MRI methods, so it is naïve to determine that schizophrenia is a neurological process that is weighty when symptoms appear
 Or that it is better to consider it a process of neurological development in which an abnormal amount of brain is produced at an early age

 The author states that in schizophrenia two networks of the white matter tract may be affected, which is likely to 'break down' the gray matter regions to which they are attached
 fmri adhyayanon ke dauraan sizophreniake rogiyon main mastishk ke difolt network or tascapositive network main gaharaa sambandh dekha gaya or yah kramah intervavlokan or bahya avlokan ke prati prati dhyaan kaa atyadhik anukulan pradarshit kar saktaa he

 However, in the context of the side effects of psychiatric obstructive treatment, the treatment of those who have never been diagnosed with schizophrenia, especially in those with symptoms of dysfiguring tardive dyskinesia, and in rare but far more lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome
 The most commonly used health safeguards for the prevention of schizophrenia have taken the form of public awareness campaigns informing about the risks and early symptoms, aimed at detecting the disease and giving early treatment to those who delay treatment
 To be improved

 Fasting for some or all meals, drinks or both without any duration is called fasting
 upwas purna yaa aanshik ho saktaa he
 It can range from very short periods to months
 upwas ke anek rup hai
 Fasting has been practiced since prehistoric times as a religious and spiritual practice
 yah kai prakaar kaa hota he
 This type of fasting is religious, which is done on the days of Ekadashi, Sankranti and similar festivals
 aise upwaason main dopaher ko doodh kii bani hui mithai tathaa shushk or hare donon prakaar ke fal khaae ja sakate hai
 Some are waterless fasting
 inamen dinabhar na to kuch khaaya jaataa he or na jal piya jaataa he
 Fasting is also done in diseases, which is called skipping
 aajkal raajnneetik upwas bhi kiye jate hai jinhen "anshan" kehete hai
 Their aim is to attract the government's vision and get them to do the work for which fasting is done
 kabhi-kabhi bhojan na milane par vivash hokar bhi upwas karnaa padataa he
 All these types of fasting have the same effect on the body
 ek baar bhojan grahan karne par kuch ghanton tak jo sharir ko khaae hue aahaar se shakti milti rahati he, kintu usak pashchaat sharir main sanchit aahaar ke avyavon-protein, carbohydrate or sneh yaa vasa-kaa sharir upyog karne lagata he
 Fats and carbohydrates generate the power to work
 protein kaa kaam sharir ke toote phute bhaagon kaa punarnirmaan karnaa he
 But when fasting is prolonged or prolonged, the body also uses protein to produce power
 is prakaar protein uthkanirmaan or shakti-utpaadan donon kaam karata he
 Carbohydrates are present in the body in two forms: glucose, which circulates in the blood and glycogen, which is stored in the muscles and liver
 saadharantaya carbohydrate sharir pratidin ke bhojan se miltaa he
 During the fasting period, when the glucose in the blood is spent, the accumulated glycogen gets converted into glucose and goes into the blood
 upwas kii avasthaa main yah sanchit carbohydrate do chaar dinon main hi samaapt ho jaataa he; tab carbohydrate kaa kaam vasa ko karnaa padataa he or saath hi protein ko bhi is kaary main sahaayta kerani padati he
 Special amounts of body fat are stored under the skin and in the arts
 sthool sharir main vasa kii adhik maatra rahati he
 For this reason, a gross person can starve longer than a lean person
 sharir ko dainik karmon or ushma ke liye carbohydrate, vasa or protein, teenon padaarthon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo usko apane aahaar se praapt hote hai
 The fat available from the diet goes to the liver and there, in chemical reactions, is converted into Vasamal and Aceto-acetic acid, it flows into the blood and provides strength and heat to the body
 upwas kii avasthaa main sharir kii sanchit vasa kaa yakrut dwaara isi prakaar upyog kiya jaataa he
 This accumulated fat can also replace carbohydrates for a few weeks
 antar keval yah he ki jab sharir ko aahaar se carbohydrate miltaa rahata he tab acito-aseetic-amla yakrut dwaara utani hi maatra main sanchalit hota he jitani kii aavashyaktaa sharir ko hoti he
 In the absence of carbohydrates, the production of this acid is special and high and some part of it starts coming in the urine
 is ansh ko kitone kehete hai kitone kaa mutr main paaya janaa sharir main carbohydrate kii kami kaa chihn he or uskaa arth yah hota he ki carbohydrate kaa kaary ab sanchit vasa ko karnaa pad rahaa he
 It occurs in the beginning of fasting
 rugnavastha main jab rogi bhojan nahin karata tab sharir main carbohydrate ke chayapachay ko jaanane ke liye mutr main kitone kii jaanch karte rahanaa aavashyak he
 After the long-term fasting is eliminated, the weight of heat and strength production falls on the protein
 sharir ke komal bhaag kaa praaia: 75 pratishat ansh protein se bana hua rahaa he
 During the fasting period, this protein is converted into amino-acids and flows into the blood
 sabhi angon ke proteinon kaa sanchaalan samaan maatra main nahin hota he
 As long as the weight of the brain and heart is usually reduced by 3 percent, then the weight of muscles decreases by 30 percent
 shaareerik utakon se praapt amino-amlon ke mukhya do kaary hai : atyaavashyak angon ko surakshit rakhana or rakt main glucose kii apekshit maatra ko sthir rakhana
 Proteins are nitrogenous substances
 atev jab sharir ke protein ko uparyukt kaam karne padate hai tab mutr kaa nitrogeneey ansh bad jaataa he
 In the first week of fasting, this fraction comes out to about 10 grams with urine per day
 duusare or tisare saptaah main isaki maatra kuch kam ho jaati he
 If the kidneys are unable to excrete this nitrogenous fraction, then that part starts going into the blood and in the condition of diureticness in the person
 isko vyakti kii antim avasthaa samajhnaa chahie
 There is no accumulation of protein like carbohydrates and fats in the body
 sharir ek jivit yantra he
 Protein is the basis of its composition
 is yantra kii yah visheshta he ki iske saamaanya bhaagon main protein upvaaskaal main bhi aavashyak angon kii raksha karte rahete hai
 The functioning of the body apparatus is dependent on the chemicals, ferments and hormones produced in the body
 ye upwas kii avasthaa main bhi banate rahete hai
 For the manufacture of these, normal parts of the body provide their protein in the form of amino-acids, so that these chemical substances continue to form and do not interfere with the body's action
 swasth sharir ke liye protein kii dainik maatra praaia: nishchit he
 One gram of protein is required in proportion to each kilogram of body weight per day for a young man and it comes from diet
 garbhvatee stri tathaa badhate hue shishu, balak athwa tarun ko 50 pratishat adhik maatra main protein kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 By staying in this high protein diet, the body has to boycott it by analyzing it, due to which the function of liver and kidney is increased unnecessarily
 protein shaareerik yantra kii marammat ke kaam main aata he
 Therefore, protein should be increased in the diet during the post-acute and post-fast period
 in sab baton kaa pataa nitrogen santulan ke lekhe jokhe se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This work is done in biochemistry-laboratory
 yadi mutr ke nitrogen kii maatra bhojan ke nitrogen se kam ho tab isko "dhanatmak nitrogen santulan" kehete hai
 From this it is understood that the body is consuming only a specific amount of nitrogen in the diet
 yadi, iske vipareet, mutr kaa nitrogen adhik ho, to iskaa arth yah he ki sharir apane protein se bane nitrogen kaa bhi bahishkaar kar rahaa he
 This state is called "negative nitrogen balance"
 upwas kii avasthaa main "rinatmak protein santulan" or upwasottar kaal main, aahaar main protein paryaapt maatra main rahane par, "dhanatmak protein santulan" rahata he
 In the days of disease, food is often discontinued in our country and warji, sago etc
 are given
 isse rogi ko tanik bhi protein nahin miltaa, jisase angon ke hraas kii purti nahin ho paati
 Therefore, long-digested protein is also required to be given to the patient in some form
 badhate hue baalkon or bacchon main protein or bhi aavashyak he
 For a few days in fasting, physical activity depends on accumulated carbohydrates, then on specific accumulated fats and finally on body proteins
 mutr or rakt kii pariksha se un padaarthon kaa pataa chal saktaa he jinka sharir par us samay upyog kar rahaa he
 The direct symptom of fasting is a continuous decline in one's power
 sharir kii vasa ghul jaati he, peshiyaan ksheen hone lagati hai
 Getting up, sitting, turning etc
 becomes difficult for the person and in the end consciousness also goes away in the state of urination
 rakt main glucose kii kami se sharir klaant tathaa ksheen hota jaataa he or ant main shaareerik yantra apana kaam band kar detaa he
 The account of the people of the famed Bengal of 1943 is horrifying
 is akaal ke saamaajik or naitik drushtikon bade hi romaanchakaari hai
 But his scientific study was very instructive
 bubhukshiton ke sambandh main jo anveshan hue unase upwas vigyaan ko bada laabh hua
 One example is that by putting milk in the mouth of these prematurely hungry people, it was immediately ejected from the anus
 jaan padataa tha ki unki antadiyon main na pachan ras banataa tha or na unamem kuch gati rah gai thi
 In such a state, food was given to them by the veins
 tab kuch kaal ke baad unke amashay kaam karne lagate the or tab bhi ve purv paachit padaarthon ko hi pachaa sakate the
 Gradually, they had the power to digest milk and other foods
 isi prakaar gat vishwayuddh main jin deshon main khaadya vastuon par bahut niyantran tha or janata ko bahut dinon tak puraa aahaar nahin mil paata tha unamem bhi upvasajanit lakshan paae gaye or unka adhyayan kiya gaya
 These studies led to a significant increase in dietetics and fasting knowledge
 aisi alpahari janata kaa swasthya bahut ksheen ho jaataa he
 There is no immunity in it
 gat vishwayuddh main uchit aahaar kii kami se kitne hi balak andhe ho gaye, kitne hi anya rogon ke grass bane
 Fasting is complete or incomplete, short duration or long duration, whether based on religion or politics, its effect on the body is the same by duration
 dirghakaalin alpaahar se sharir main ve hi parivartan hote hai jo purna upwas main kuch hi samay main ho jate hai
 There are special rules for breaking the fast
 anshan: praaia: falon ke ras se todaa jaataa he
 The juice should also be given slowly, so that no special weight is placed on the digestive system
 do teen din thodaa ras lene ke pashchaat aahaar ke thos padaarthon ko bhi aise rup main prarambh karnaa chahie ki amashay aadi par, jo kuch samay se pachan ke anbhyast ho gaye hai, aksmaat vishesh bhaar na pad jaae
 The amount of diet should be increased gradually
 is avadhi main sharir vishesh adhik maatra main protein grahan karata he, iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 As soon as the fast starts, the body does not get power from the food according to the rules of routine, so other remedies should be used for this, such as the use of pure air and pure water
 shuddh vaayu main gahari saans lene se pranavayu ke sparsh se rakt main pehle se upasthit vishele tatv dur hote hai
 During the fasting period no unnatural food gets into the body, so the foreign matter is not found in the blood and it is purified
 dhoop-snaan se sharir ko anek vitamins milte hai tathaa rogon ke keetanu nasht hote hai
 During fasting period, more water should be drunk, so that more urine is excreted from the body through excretion
 mutr gurdo main rakt chhanakar banataa hai, atev rakt main jal kii adhikta hone se adhik gandagee saaf hoti he
 Fasting can be done from 2-3 days to two months continuously according to physical condition and disease
 ek saptaah se adhik kaa upwas lambe upwas kii shrenee main aata hai
 Prolonged fasting should be done very carefully, otherwise there is a fear of loss in place of profit
 lambe upwas todane main kaaphi saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 It should be broken with lemon juice or orange juice
 phir ek din tak mausam ke fal lene chahie
 One should take fruits for the fourth time of the day for which he has fasted, and after that he should eat food
 par yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki upwas ke baad pun: galat bhojan na le
 The benefits of fasting will be felt by doing this and if the body gets pure, if the foreign matter goes into the body, then it will be harmful to the body in full quantity

 Its period is believed to be from 4500 to 1900 BC
 bich main 2300-2100 isapurv ke dauraan akkad ne sumer par prabhutaa hasil kii, lekin akkad ke patan ke baad sumer phir se majboot hua
 It is believed that the rulers of Sumer were not Semitic - that is, they were not ancestors of today's Jews or Arab Muslims

 Goddess of the west emeter yaa 'emmapi' kisi paripath kii kisi shakha main bahane vaali vidyut dhara ko maapne vaala yantra he
 The devices used to measure very small currents are called "millimeter" or "micrometer"
 ameter kii sabase puraani dizin di'arsonal kaa dharamapi yaa chalit kundalee dharamapi tha
 In 1820, the ampere invented that if a conductor, in which current flows, is placed in a magnetic field, then a force acts on it
 is bal kaa maan chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata, dharaman or chaalak kii lambaai ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 The direction of this force is determined by Fleming's left-hand law
 apane baayein haath kaa angutha, uske paas kii ungali or bich kii ungali madhyamaa kaa is prakaar failaayen ki ve teenon ek duusare ke lamberup rahen
 If the index finger points in the direction of the magnetic field and the median in the direction of the current, then the speed of the conductor will be in the direction of the thumb
 chumbakeey kshetra main rakhi hui kisi kundali main jab vidyutdhara pravaahit hoti he, to kundali par ek balyugma kaary karne lagata he, jisus vah ghoomane lagati he
 The dharmapi that have been made by using this principle, they are called chalakunda dharamapi
 isamen ek ytaakar kundali hoti he, jisamen patale or vidyutrodhit taanbe ke taar ke bahut chakkar hote hai
 This coil is hung with a screw by a very thin leaf of phosphor brange, one end of the coil is attached to this leaf and the leaf is connected to a connective screw of the dielectric
 is pattee main ek vrittakar samtal yaa natodar darpan bhi laga rahata he, jo pattee ke saath saath ghumta he
 The second end of the coil is connected to a spiral spring of metal, which is connected to the second connective screw
 yah kundali ek shaktishaalee sthaayee naal chumbak ke dhruvon ke bich main lataki rahati he
 The poles of the magnet are curved in concave cylindrical shape
 ek narm lohe kaa chota sa belan donon dhruvakhandon ke bich main kundali ke bheetar ek pech dwaara dharamapi kii peeth main ksaa rahata he
 All these items are kept locked in an non-magnetic box
 baks ke saamne ke bhaag main kaanch laga rahata he, jisase darpan kaa vikshep lamp tathaa paimaana vidhi se napa ja sake
 When electric current flows in the coil, a force act on the two arms of the coil and rotate the coil from its position, causing a spasm in the phosphor brange leaf and the downward spiral spring and a twitch force pair
 But starts working in the opposite direction
 jisase kundali sheeghra hi santulan main aa jaati he
 If the coil has a deflection angle, the current comes from the following formula: arthath dharaman vikshep kone kaa samaanupati hota he
 These thermometers are very stable and suitable sensitizers
 inase 10-10 ampiore tak kii dhara naapi ja sakati he
 There are mainly two types of magnetoscope
 isamen kundali ek dhaatu ke dhaanche par lapet di jaati he, jisase dhara pravaahit hone par kundali vikshepit ho sheeghra sthir ho jaati he
 As the coil rotates, vortex currents arise in it and its metal structure and stop the coil
 kundali dolan nahin karti, isi se is yantra ko mrit-spand kehete hai
 The horoscope reaches its former position as soon as the current is removed
 atev dhara kaa maan kundali kii purvasthiti tathaa dhara pravaahit hone par kii sthiti ke gyaan se badi saralata se gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 In this currentometer, the coil is tied on a dielectric structure and due to this, there is no vortex current in it
 at: kundali ke vikshep main bahut kam pratirodh padataa he
 The coil oscillates on both sides of its deflection when the current is not flowing through the metal structure
 yah ati sookshmagrahi hota he or kshanik aavesh ko bhi badi sugamawapurv isse ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 These are of two types: attractors and repulsors
 vidyutrodhi taron kii ek sthir kundali se yadi vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, to kundali ke bich main or aasapaas main bhi chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 If a piece of cast iron is hung near this horoscope, it gets attracted towards the coil
 is lohe ke tukade main agar ek sanketak laga ho, to sanketak bhi vikshepit ho jayega
 If there is such a mechanism that it can be brought to equilibrium by applying force opposite to the attraction force on the piece of iron, then the value of the current will be known by the deflection of the indicator
 bahudhaa ek sarpil kamaani dwaara is aakarshanabal kaa virodh kiya jaataa he
 The force of attraction is proportional to the square of the current-value
 isliye sanketak kaa vikshep bhi dhara maan ke varg ke samaanupati hoga
 For this reason, it can also find the value of alternating current
 vidyutarodhi taron ke kai chakkaaron kii sthir kundali ke bich, do naram lohe ke patale chad kundali ke aksh ke samaantar lage hai
 One rod is fixed, the other is connected to an indicator which is mounted on a nail itself
 sanketak kaa doosraa sira ek dial par ghumta he
 When the current flows in the coil, both rods become the same type of induced magnet
 chumbakeey niyamon ke anusaar unamem pratikarshan hoto he or sanketak se judaa loha gum jaataa he, jisase sanketak main vikshep hota he
 In this also, the deflection angle is proportional to the square of the torrent
 ye yantra atyant saral or saste hote hai
 When measurement does not require much precision and many robust instruments are required, then ammeters and voltmeters based on this principle are used
 bijli gharon main switchboard par narm lohe ke yantron kaa hi prayog adhiktar hota he
 The attraction or repulsion in the induced magnet does not depend on the direction of fluency
 bal dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 Therefore whatever the direction of current flow, the direction of force is same
 inhen kaarnon se ye yantra disht dhara athwa prayavartin dhara donon ko naapane ke prayog main laae jate hai
 Due to the inductance of the coil, they cannot be used in the measurement of high frequency alternating current
 is prakaar ke emeter vidyutdhara ke ooshmiya prabhaav par nirbhar hote hai
 When current flows through a conductor, then that conductor becomes hot
 utpann ooshmaa kaa maan 2 x ke samaanupati hota he
 If the current is in the ampere and the resistance is in ohms, then ooshmaa kaa maan dharaman ke varg ke samaanupati hota he, arthath dhara kii disha par nirbhar nahin hai
 Therefore, such ammeters can be used to measure both directional or alternating current
 is prabhaav kaa prayog maapanvidhi main do prakaar se kiya gaya he : The first type of instrument was first created by Major Cardew in 1883
 hartman-bron ne isamen sadhaar kiya
 The current flows in the wire and spreads as it is heated
 is samay taar ke bich main judi hui kamaani taar ko khinchati he or ghirani prasar ke anusaar gum jaati he
 At the same time, the pulley indicator is deflected and the current value is displayed on the dial
 dhara kii anupasthiti main taar thandha ho kar sikudta he or sanketak phir apni purv dasha main aa jaataa he
 Such integrators have been used a lot due to being simple and cheap
 inamen kundali nahin hoti, is kaaran unamem prerakatv nahin hota or ucch aavriti kii prayavartin dhara bhi naapi jaati he, parantu ye paryaapt rup se yatharth nahin hote or adhik maatra kii dhara ko sahan karne main asamarth hote hai
 These are more convenient and accurate thermo-thermometer
 aajkal ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kaa maapan adhiktar unheen yantron se hota he
 The current flows through the wire and heats it
 is taar se jude hue tamba kanstantan taapyugma kaa sangam bhi garam hota he
 Due to this, electric carrying force is produced in the ratio of heat to temperature
 yah ek disht dharamapi main dhara pravaahit karata he
 When the dial is calibrated, it displays the value of the first alternating current
 == samakalni emeter ==hiiuu The Union Cabinet of India on Monday approved on 3 August 2012, the Build at Workplace Safety Bill against Sexual Harassment of Women, 2010, to ensure a safe environment for women at work sites in Parliament, both in the public and private sectors

 The Lok Sabha is the lower House of Representatives
 rajyasabha main 245 sadsy hote hai
 In which 12 members are nominated by the President of India
 inhen 'namit sadsy' kaha jaataa he
 Other members are elected
 rajyasabha main sadsy 6 saal ke liye chune jate hai, jiname ek-tihaai sadsy har 2 saal main seva-nivruth hote hai
 In any federal rule, the upper part of the federal legislature is made a federal level defender of state interests due to constitutional obligation
 isi siddhant ke chalate rajya sabha kaa gathan hua he
 For this reason, Rajya Sabha is seen as the equality of Houses, which has been formed as the second house of Parliament
 rajyasabha kaa gathan ek punarikshan sadan ke rup main hua he jo loksabhaa dwaara paas kiye gayi prastaavon kii punariksha kare
 It can also fill the shortage of experts in the Council of Ministers because at least 12 experts are nominated in it

 bharat ke uparashtrapati rajyasabha ke sabhapati hote hai
 The first session of Rajya Sabha was held on 13 May 1952
 rajya sabha ek aisa naam he jisaki ghoshnaa sabhapith dwaara sabha main 23 agast 1954 ko kii gai thi
 It has its own special features
 bharat main dwitiya sadan kaa prarambh 1918 ke monteg-chamsford prativedan se hua
 The Government of India Act, 1919 provided for the creation of the Council of States as the second house of the then Legislature, with limited privileges and which actually came into existence in 1921
 governor-general tatkaaleen council of stats kaa paden adhyaksh hota tha
 Hardly any changes were made to its formation through the Government of India Act, 1935
 samvidhan sabha, jisaki pehali baithak 9 disambar 1946 ko hui thi, ne bhi 1950 tak kendriya vidhanmandal ke rup main kaary kiya, phir ise 'anantim sansad' ke rup main parivartit kar diya gaya
 During this period, the Central Legislature, called the 'constituent Assembly' and later the 'provisional Parliament', remained unicameral until the first elections were held in 1952
 swatantra bharat main dwitiya sadan kii upyogita athwa anupayogita ke sambandh main samvidhan sabha main vistrut bahes hui or antat: swatantra bharat ke liye ek dwisadani vidhanmandal banane kaa nirnay mukhya rup se isliye kiya gaya kyonki parisangheey pranali ko apaar vividhtaon vaale itane vishaal desh ke liye sarvaadhik sahaj swaroop kii sarkaar mana gaya
 In fact, a directly elected single assembly was deemed insufficient to meet the challenges facing independent India
 at:, 'council of stats' ke rup main gyaat ek aise dwitiya sadan kaa srijan kiya gaya jisaki sanrachana or nirvachan paddati pratyaksht: nirvaachit lok sabha se purnat: bhinn thi
 It was deemed to be another House whose membership is less than the Lok Sabha
 iskaa aashay parisangheey sadan arthath ek aisi sabha se tha jiskaa nirvachan rajyon or do sangh rajya kshetron kii sabhaaon ke nirvaachit sadasyon dwaara kiya gaya, jinamein rajyon ko samaan pratinidhitiv nahin diya gaya
 Apart from the elected members, the President also nominated twelve members for the assembly
 isaki sadsyta hetu nunatam aayu tees varsh niyat kii gai jabaki nichle sadan ke liye yah pachchis varsh he
 Elements of dignity and prestige were added to the Council of States meeting
 aisa bharat ke uparashtrapati ko rajya sabha kaa paden sabhapati banaakar kiya gaya, jo isaki baithkon kaa sabhapatitv karte hai
 Article 80 of the constitution prescribes a maximum strength of 250 members of the Rajya Sabha, out of which 12 members are nominated by the President and 238 are the representatives of the Member States and the Union Territories
 tathaapi, rajya sabha ke sadasyon kii vartmaan sankhya 245 he, jinamein se 233 sadsy rajyon or sangh rajyashetra dilli tathaa puducheri ke pratinidhi hai or 12 raashtrapati dwaara namanirdeshit hai
 The members nominated by the President shall be persons who have special knowledge or practical experience in respect of subjects such as literature, science, art and social service

 Qualifications for membership of Parliament are set out in Article 84 of the Constitution
 rajya sabha kii sadsyta ke liye arha hone ke liye kisi vyakti ke paas nimnlikhit arhataaen honi chahie: He should be a citizen of India and take an oath or affirmation and sign it before any person authorized in this behalf by the Election Commission as per the format given for this purpose in the Third Schedule; use kam se kam tees varsh kii aayu kaa hona chahie; He should have such other qualifications as may be prescribed in this behalf by or under any law made by Parliament
 nirarhataayen Article 102 of the constitution stipulates that a person shall be disqualified to be elected a member of a House of Parliament and to be a member- yadi vah bharat sarkaar ke yaa kisi raajay kii sarkaar ke adheen, aise pad ko chhodkar, jisko dhaaran karne vaale kaa nirarhit na hona sansad ne vidhi dwaara ghoshit kiya he, koi laabh kaa pad dhaaran karata he; If it is malformed and such declaration of competent court exists; yadi vah anunmochit diwalia he; If he is not a citizen of India or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign state or has accepted allegiance or admonition to a foreign state; yadi vah sansad dwaara banaai gai kisi vidhi dwaara yaa uske adheen is prakaar nirarhit kar diya jaataa he
 Explanation
 — For the purposes of this section, no person shall be deemed to hold the office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of a State merely because he is a Union or a Minister of such State
 iske atirikt, samvidhan kii dasvin anusuchee main dal-parivartan ke aadhaar par sadasyon kii nirarhata ke bare main upbandh kiya gaya he
 According to the provisions of the Tenth Schedule, a member shall be disqualified as a member if he voluntarily relinquishes membership of his political party; Or He votes in the House against any direction given by a political party of which he is a member or continues to vote and is not waived within fifteen days by such political party
 has been done
 nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main nirvaachit sadsy nirarhit hoga yadi vah apane nirvachan ke pashchaat kisi raajnneetik dal main sammilit ho jaataa he
 However, a nominated member of the House by the President will be allowed to join any political party if he / she does so within the first six months of assuming his / her place in the House
 kisi sadsy ko is aadhaar par nirarhit nahin kiya jayega yadi vah rajya sabha kaa up-sabhapati nirvaachit hone ke pashchaat apane raajnneetik dal kii sadsyta swechha se chhod detaa / detii he
 Representatives of States and Union Territories in the Rajya Sabha are elected by indirect electoral system
 prayek rajya tathaa do sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhiyon kaa nirvachan us rajya kii vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadasyon tathaa us sangh rajya kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal ke sadasyon, jaisaa bhi maamla ho, dwaara ekal sankramntic mat dwaara anupatik pratinidhitiv pranali ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 The electoral college of the Delhi National Capital Region consists of the elected members of the Delhi Legislative Assembly and the Puducherry Union Territory electorate in the Puducherry Legislative Assembly
 rajya sabha ek sthaayee sadan he or yah bhang nahin hota
 However, one-third of the members of Rajya Sabha retire after every two years
 purnakalik avadhi ke liye nirvaachit sadsy chah varshon kii avadhi ke liye kaary karata he
 An election held to fill a vacancy created otherwise than on retirement at the end of the term of a member is called a 'by-election'
 up-chunaav main nirvaachit koi sadsy us sadsy kii shesh karyavadhi tak sadsy bana rah saktaa he jisane tyaagptr de diya tha yaa jisaki mrityu ho gai thi yaa jo dasvin anusuchee ke adheen sabha kaa sadsy hone ke liye nirarhit ho gaya tha
 The Presiding Officers of Rajya Sabha have the responsibility to conduct the proceedings of the House
 bharat ke uparashtrapati rajya sabha ke paden sabhapati hai
 Unlike the members of the Rajya Sabha, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha has a tenure of 5 years, the Rajya Sabha also elects a Deputy Chairman from among its members
 rajya sabha main upsabhadhyakshon kaa ek panel bhi hota he, jiske sadasyon kaa namanirdesan sabhapati, rajya sabha dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In the absence of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, a member from the panel of Deputy Speaker presides over the proceedings of the House
 lok sabha ke vipareet rajyasabha kaa sabhapati apana istipha upasabhapati ko nahin balki raashtrapati ko detaa he
 The secretary-general is appointed by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and his rank is equivalent to the highest civil servant of the Union
 mahasachiv gumnaam rah kar kaary karte hai or sansadeey maamalon par salaah dene ke liye tatparta se peethasin adhikariyon ko uplabdh rahete hai
 The secretary-general is also the administrative head of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat and the custodian of the records of the House
 vah rajya sabha ke sabhapati ke nidesh va niyantranaadhin kaary karte hai
 Under Article 75 of the Constitution, the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha which means that the Rajya Sabha cannot form or topple the Government
 tathaapi, yah sarkaar par niyantran rakh sakati he or yah kaary vishesh rup se us samay bahut mahatvapurn ho jaataa he jab sarkaar ko rajya sabha main bahumat praapt nahin hota he
 In the case of a general legislation, to remove the deadlock between the two Houses, the Constitution provides for a joint sitting of the two Houses
 vastut:, ateet main aise teen avasar aae hai jab sansad kii sabhaaon kii unke bich matbhedon ko sulajhane ke liye sanyukt baithak hui thi
 The issues to be raised in the joint meeting are decided by a majority of the total number of members present and voting in both the Houses
 sanyukt baithak sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh main yojit kii jaati he jisaki adhyakshata loksabhaadhyaksh dwaara kii jaati he
 However, in the case of a Money Bill, there is no provision in the Constitution to convene a joint sitting of the two Houses, as the Lok Sabha enjoys prominence over the Rajya Sabha in financial matters
 samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke sambandh main, samvidhan main yah upbandh kiya gaya he ki aise vidheyak ko donon sabhaaon dwaara, samvidhan ke anuchhed 368 ke adheen vihit rup main, vishisht bahumat se paarit kiya janaa hota he
 Therefore, there is no provision to remove the deadlock between the two Houses in relation to the Constitution Amendment Bill
 mantri sansad kii kisi bhi sabha se ho sakate hai
 The constitution does not make any distinction between the assemblies in this regard
 prayek mantri ko kisi bhi sabha main bolne or uski kaarywahi main bhaag lene kaa adhikaar hota he, lekin vah usee sabha main mat dene kaa hakdaar hota he jiskaa vah sadsy hota he
 Similarly, with respect to the powers, privileges and immunities of the Houses of Parliament, their members and their committees, the two Houses have been placed on the same level by the Constitution
 jin anya mahatvapurn vishyon ke sambandh main donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai ve is prakaar hai:- raashtrapati kaa nirvachan tathaa mahabhiyog, uparashtrapati kaa nirvachan, apatkaal kii udghoshnaa kaa anumodan, rajyon main sanvaidhanik tantra kii vifaltaa se sambandhit udghoshnaa or vittiya apatkaal
 In connection with receiving reports and letters from various constitutional authorities, etc
, both Houses have equal powers
 is prakaar, yah spasht he ki mantri-parishad kii samuhik jimmedaari ke maamle or kuch aise vittiya maamle, jo sirf lok sabha ke kshetradhikaar main aate hai, ke sivaae donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai
 The Rajya Sabha, being a federal house, has certain powers under the Constitution
 rajyasabha ke paas teen vishesh shaktiyaan hoti he All the subjects / areas related to the legislation are divided into three lists - Union List, State List and Concurrent List
 sangh or rajya suchiyaan paraspar apvarjit hai- koi bhi duusare ke kshetra main rakhe gaye vishay par kanoon nahin bana saktaa
 However, if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, it is "necessary or expedient in the national interest" that the Parliament certify any in the State List If the law is made on the subject, then the Parliament becomes empowered to legislate for the entire territory of India or any part of it on the subject specified in that resolution
 aisa sankalp adhiktam ek varsh kii avadhi ke liye pravrutt rahegaa parantu yah avadhi isi prakaar ke sankalp ko paarit karke ek varsh ke liye pun: badhaayi ja sakati he

 Although geochemistry has made special progress in the twentieth century, the notion of geochemistry is very ancient
 shabd bhu-rasayan sarvapratham san 1838 main swiss rasayanajna shanbin dwaara prakaash main aayaa
 Clarke, a US scientist, has given a finite explanation of the subject in his book, "the Data of Geochemistry"
 usamen kaha gaya he ki vartmaan uddeshyon ke liye prayek chattan ek rasinic paddati maani ja sakati he
 It can also bring chemical changes by various means
 aise parivartan nai paddati ke nirmaan ke saath ant main santulan ke vikshobh ko suchit karte hai
 This new method is permanent in a new situation
 in parivartanon kaa adhyayan bhu-rasayan kaa kshetra he
 To determine what changes are possible, how and when they occur, it is the job of the chemist to observe the events that take place in the said changes and record their final results
 san 1954 main ve0 em0 goldsmith ne, jo aadhunik bhu-rasayan ke pita kahe jate hai, bhu-rasayan ke prathimak uddeshy jahaan ek ore prithvi tathaa uske bhaagon kaa maatraatmak sanghatan gyaat karnaa he, vahiin duusari ore vishesh tatwo ke vitaran par niyantran rakhanevaale niyamon kaa pataa lagaana bhi he
 To solve these problems a geochemist requires extensive collection of analytical data of terrestrial matter, such as rock, water, atmosphere etc

 In the same year, the famous geochemical phan lae showed that the gradual configuration of the atoms inside the crystal acts as diffraction grating when the x ray is passed through the crystal, and in this way he discovers the permeable structure of solids

 Even after the valuable efforts of scientists to give a firm foundation to this subject, this work fell on the shoulders of the great scientist whose name cannot be separated from the history of geochemistry and he is the father and originator of modern geochemistry
 BM Goldshmit unke athak or maargdarshi anusandhan ne, jo unhone oslo or gatingen main kiya, is ugte hue ankur ko sinchaa he
 In India, work on this subject was first done by Professor Krishnakumar Mathur and Sir Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar at Kashi Hindu University

 Salvation is the only name to be released from the bondage of this birth
 jab manushya moksh praapt kar letaa he, tab phir use is sansar main aakaar janm lene kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti

 It is necessary in the imagination of heaven that a human being, after experiencing the fruits of virtue or auspicious deeds, again takes shape in this world; Due to this, he will have to suffer many kinds of suffering again
 par moksh kii kalpana main yah baat nahin he 
 On attaining salvation, the living being is released from all kinds of bondages and sufferings
 bhartiya darshan main nashvarata ko dukh kaa kaaran mana gaya he
 The world is the center of traffic, birth and death

 moksh is tarah ke jivan kii antim parinti he
 It has been accepted as the ultimate purpose of life by assuming altruistic values
 moksh ko vastusatya ke rup main sweekaar karnaa kathin he
 As a result, in all systems, the idea of salvation is often self-centered
 antatogatva yah ek vaiyaktik anubhuti hi siddh ho paata he
 Although different systems have imagined salvation differently according to their knowledge, but ignorance can be free from sorrow
 ise jeevanmukti kahenge
 But there are some systems, in which justice, specialty and specialism are notable; Denying the possibility of liberation of life
 duusare rup ko "videhamukti" kehete hai
 Whose feelings of happiness and sorrow have been destroyed, after leaving the body, he is freed forever from the cycle of traffic

 Nirvana has been conceived parallel to salvation in Buddhist philosophy
 "nirvana" shabd kaa arth he, bujh janaa
 Critics have made the doctrine of nirvana meaningless by the original meaning of this derivation of the word nirvana
 unka maananaa he ki nirvana kaa arth he sabhi maanviya bhaawanaaon kaa bujh janaa, jo mrityu ke saamaan he
 This type of meaning has tried to ridicule the principle of Nirvana
 duusari baat he ki aalochak 'nirvana' or 'parinirvana' main bhed karnaa bhi bhul gaye hai
 "when the bodies of the body are shattered, all the nouns stop, all the afflictions are destroyed, all the responses stop and the consciousness goes away, it is called Parinirvan
 nirvana kaa kabhi bhi yah arth nahin ho saktaa
 Nirvana means to keep sufficient restraint on one's emotions, so that a man is able to walk on the path of religion

 nirvana prapti se sadacharanpurna jivan jiya jaataa he
 The goal of life is nirvana
 nirvana hi dhyey he
 Nirvana is the medium way
 nirvana aashtagic-maarg ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 In Buddhist philosophy too, the reason for the bond has been attributed to Trishna, Vitrishna and Avidya
 jab aadmi in bandhanon se mukt ho jaataa he to vah nirvana praapt karnaa jan jaataa he or uske liye nirvana-path khul jaataa he
 An octagonal route has been arranged for this
 ve is prakaar hai: samyag drushti, samyag sankalp, samyag vachan, samyag karm, samyag jeevika, samyag praytn, samyag smriti or samyag samadhi
