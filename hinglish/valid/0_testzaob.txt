 This is called "bus Mitra, Dhumpan Nagarnu Hola" in Nepali

 The West Land is a modern 434-line poem written by TS Eliot, first published in 1922
 ise 20 veen sadi kii sabase mahatvapurn kavitaaon main se ek bhi kaha jaataa he
 Despite the poignancy of the poem — it is a journey between satire and prophecy, with the unexpected change of the speaker, the mournful literature of place and time, culture and literature — the poem has become a familiar criterion of modern literature
 iske prasiddh muhaavaron main hai "april ij da krolest manth" ; "ai vil sho you fier in a handphul of dust"; or sanskrit bhashaa kaa mantra " om shantih, shantih, shantih " Eliot may have worked on the poem The Waste Land for a number of years before its first publication in 1922
 neuyork ke ek vakil or aadhuniktawaad ke sangrakshak jon queen ko 9 may 1921 ko likhe gaye ek patr main, aliot ne likhaa ki " mere paas ek lambi kavita he, jo dimag main he or aanshik rup se kaagaj par likhi bhi ja chuki he, main use puraa karnaa chahta hoon
" Richard Aldington recalls that when Eliot read the draft of The West Land's manuscript in London "a year or so ago", Eliot came to visit him in his country, walking into a cemetery as he did Thomas Gray's Allegi Returns in a country began to discuss the church-yard poem
 eldington likhte hai: mujhe yah jaan kar aashcharya hua ki aliot ne itani lokapriy cheez kii prashansa kii or phir usne kaha ki agar ek samakaleen kavi, grey kii tarah apni simaaon ko jaanata he, tabhi vah aisi kavita ke sabhi uphaaron par dhyaan kendrit karegaa, jo use isi prakaar kii safalataa ke kaaran mil sakate hai
 " aliot, ko jinhen kuch snaivik vikaar tha, chikitsakon dwaara aaraam karne kii salaah di gayi thi
 He applied for three months' leave from the bank; The reason given on his staff-card was "nervous breakdown"
 He and his first wife, Vivienne high-wood Eliot, traveled to the coastal resort of Margaret for recovery
 vahaan rahete hue, aliot ne 'westlend' kavita par kaam kiya or sambhavatya ezara pound ke praarambhik sanskaran ko darshaya, jab landan lautne ke baad, aliot ne navambar 1921 main paris kii yatra kii
 There he was a guest of Pound
 aliot ne doctor roger vitos se upachaar lene ke liye logen, switzaraland kii yatra kii, otoline morel ne use is doctor se milane kii salaah di thi; viven ko us samay paris ke baahar senetorium ke baahar ruknaa padaa
 logen main, aliot ne kavita kaa 19 prishthon kaa ek sanskaran taiyaar kiya
 He returned from Lausanne in early January 1922
 pound ne tabhi is par sampadakeey-tippaniyan kin or pandulipi main kai katautiyaan kin
 baad main aliot ne kavita ko pound ko samarpit kiya
 Eliot sent a manuscript manuscript draft to John Quinn in October 1922; Which reached Quinn in New York in January 1923
 queen kii mrityu ke baad is kavita kii pandulipi kaa draft unki bahan julia anderson ko viraasat main mila
 Many years later, in the early 1950s, Mrs
 Anderson's daughter Mary Conori found the contract in a museum
 1958 main usne nijee rup se inhen neuyork ke saarvajanik pustkaalay ko bech diya
 The existence of the book was not known until April 1968, and the drafts of the manuscript were not known to the poet's second wife and widow, Valeris Eliot
 1971 main, 'febar and febar' ne mul draft kii ek "pratikruti or pratilekh" kaa prakaashan kiya or ise veleri aliot ke dwaara sampadit ankit kiya gaya
 The whole poem is replicated before Pound's editorial changes
 kavita ke draft se pataa chalata he ki mul kavita antim prakashit sanskaran kii tulana main lagbhag duguni thi
 As editor, Ezra Pound 'ruthlessly quarreled' in it and due to the many suggestions he gave, the creator himself removed many large parts of it
 vartmaan main kavita kii mashhoor panktiyaan-' April is the cruellest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land, 


'— tip script ke duusare pej ke upar nahin dikhaai deteen
 tipscript ke pehle pej main 54 panktiyaan thim, jise ham duusare khand a game of chess ke ant main phir se pard sakate hai
 This page has been lightly cut by Eliot himself

 The 'the Typist Home at Tea Time' section was originally in the regular verse of the Panchpadi verse, which had the verses of Aabab, the same scheme used in Gray's Allegi, which Eliot had in mind at the time
 Were living
 pound ne draft ke is khand ke bare main kaha "padya utana ruchikar nahin he jab ki kavita isaki varantee detii he
 "finally, the regularity of the four-line verse was abandoned
 ek sanskaran main 'da fire saraman' kii shuruyaat main, ek veertapurna dohe kaa ek lambaa khand tha, jisamen elexander pope kii da rape of da lock se nakal kii gayi thi
 It described a female Fresca
 jaisaa ki richard elman ne iskaa varnan kiya he "uske shauchalay ko pope ke belinda kii tarah banane ke bajaay, freska joyas ke bloom kii tarah isamen ja rahi he
 "these lines are: elman ke anusaar "pound ne aliot ko chetavanee di ki klyonki pope ne dohon ko behatar banaaya he or joyas ne shauchalay ko, isliye kisi or round kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Pound wanted to include some short poems that Eliot wanted to insert between the five volumes
 in main se ek he, jahaan se aliot ne 'shoakgeet' ko kuch yon shuru kiya
 At the request of Vivian, Eliot's wife, a line was removed from the 'A Game of Chess' section: And we shall play a game of chess / The ivory men make company between us / Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door "this section is apparently based on her married life and she appears to be revealing these lines
 haalanki, da "iveri main" kaa arth aliot ke liye kuch or ho saktaa he: 1960 main, vivian kii mrityu ke teraa saal baad, unhone landan ke pustkaalay ko bechi jane vaali ek pratilipi main pankti ko daalaa
 In a letter to Eliot to commemorate the poem's "birth" in late December 1921, Pound wrote a 48-line poem
 The title of this poem was "sage Home"
 In this, Eliot was called the poet's value, but was compared to his mother
 kuch chand hai: Eliot had already found the publisher before editing began
 neuyork se horas livrit, boni kii ek prakaashan form se the, livrit ne ejra pound ke saath kai baithkon main hissaa liya
 During dinner on 3 January 1922, he offered to publish the works of Pound, James Joyce and Eliot
 aliot ko niojit kavita ke sharad sanskaran ke liye pustak kii 15 pratishat railty di gayi
 To increase his income and reach the maximum readership, Eliot tied up with magazines
 dial magazine ke liye landan se sambandhit hone ke kaaran iske sah maalik or sah-sampadak ke college mitra, scofield thair ke liye dial ek adarsh vikalp tha
 Although Dial offered $ 150 for the poem, Eliot resented that the entire year's work would be priced too low, as another contributor was willing to pay a considerable price for one of his short stories
 dial ke saath sauda lagbhag tay tha lekin pound ke prayaason ke saath ant main sauda tay hua, 150 dollar ke lava aliot ko dial meggin ke dwitiya vaarshik puraskaar ke liye chunaa gaya, kyonki usne apni vishisht sevaayen uplabdh karaayin thim
 a prize of $ 2000 was awarded

 Bonnie and Liveright used the promotion of Dial's prize to boost their initial sales for Eliot
 kavita ko pehle britain main lekhak ke note ke bina prakashit kiya gaya, ise ek saahitiyik patrika da criterion ke pehle sanskaran ke liye prakashit kiya gaya tha, jiskaa sampadan khud aliot ke dwaara hi kiya gaya tha
 The poem was first published in the US in November 1922 in the edition of The Dial magazine
 disambar 1922 main, kavita ko boni or livrit kii pustak main prakashit kiya gaya
 In September 1923, 'hogarth Press', a private press run by Eliot's friends Leonard and Virginia Woolf, published the first British edition of The West Land, with 450 copies by Virginia Woolf
 da west land ke prakaashan itihaas kaa varnan donald geoup ke vruttchitr main kiya gaya he
 Eliot's 1922 salary at Lloyds Bank was £ 500, he made about £ 630 with Dial, Bonnie & Liveright and Hogarth Press publications
 aliot multah is kavita ko he do da polis diferent voises sheershak dena chaahate the
 In the poem's version, Eliot brought the first two volumes of poetry from Switzerland - 'the Burial of the Dead' and 'A Game of Chess' - which appear under this title
 in ajeeb vaakyanshon ko charles dicans ke upanyaas aar mutual frends se liya gaya he, jisamen vidhwaa betty higdan apane god liye hue bete se kahati he "you mite note think it bat slopy iz a beautiphul reader of a news paper 
 hi du da polis in diferent voices "
 isse pathak ko yah samajhane main madad milegi ki haalanki kavita main kai alag alag awaajen hai, kuch aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki isamen ekmaatr kendriya chetana he
 By rejecting this title, Eliot must have felt that he had reinstated his characters' comments in his note about Tiresias
 ant main aliot ne sheershak 'da west land ' ko chunaa
 kavita ke liye apane pehle note main ve grel ligand par jessi el weston kii pustak from ritual tu romance ke sheershak ko uttaradaayi maanate hai jisamen fisher king ghayal ho jaataa he or iske parinamswaroop uski dharti banjar ho jaati he
 To fix the king and re-fertilize the land the Grail Quester asks "what's the problem with you"? kavita ko galati se sheershak "west land" diya gaya he 
 However, in a letter to Ezra Pound, Eliot politely stated that the title should begin with "the"
 kavita se pehle da petroniyas ke da setairicon se latin or greek shilaalekh diya gaya he
 In English it is as follows: "" i saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a jar, and when the boys said to her, Sibyl, what do you want? she replied i want to die
 " shilaalekh ke baad ek 'samarpan' diya gaya he, iske anusaar ejra pound ke liye: il miglior fabbro " Here Eliot is both quoting line 117 of Canto XXVI of Dante's Purgatorio, the second cantica of The Divine Comedy, where Dante defines the troubadour Arnaut Daniel as "the best smith of the mother tongue" and also Pound's title of chapter 2 of his The Spirit of Romance where he translated the phrase as "the better craftsman
" yah samarpan mul rup se aliot ke dwaara syaahi se boni or livarit ke sanskaran main likhaa gaya tha, kavita ke is saskaran ko pound ko pesh kiya gaya; baad main iske bhavi sanskarnon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The five parts of The West Land are titled: kavita ke paathya ke baad kai prishthon ke nots hai, jo iske roopak, sandarbh or sanketon kii vyakhya karte hai
 Some of these commentaries help to explain the poem, but some are controversial and most are opaque prose with no commentary
 in nots ko aliot ke prakaashak ke anurodh ke baad joda gaya, kyonki unke anusaar da west land ko ek alag pustak ke rup main prakashit karnaa uchit tha
 Eliot himself originally wanted a collection of questions about The Waste Land, or he wanted to divide a poem into five sections
 aliot ke kaam kii style naatakeey ekalaap kii sambhaavnaaon ko spasht karti he
 This expression is at least as expressive as J
 Alfred Prufrock's The Love Song
 aliot sangeet ne haul kaa bhi anand uthaate hai or manoranjan ke lokapriy rup ko is kavita main daalaa gaya he, jigfeld folice ke dwaara die gaye gane da shexpherian raag ke rachanaakaar dev stemper or jin bak hai
 The music follows the pattern of Fudge, with multiple voices entering the theme

 Interestingly, at the same time that Eliot was writing The Waste Land, Robert Bridges was working on his first neo-miltonic syllabics, the poem was titled 'poor Pool', it also took lines from many different languages
 Were
 jin sroton se aliot ne apane uddhran liye hai yaa jinke kaam ko usne shaamil kiya he ve hai: homer, sophoklass, petroniyas, virgil, ovid, saint augustin of hippo, daante aligheri, wiliam shakespeare, edmund spencer, gerard de narwal, thomas kid, jeffri chausar, thomas middlaton, jon webster, joseph conrad, jon milton, andru maarval, charles baudalere, richard veganar, oliver goldsmith, harman hoshe, alds huxley, paul varlen, walt wheatmen or baram stokar
 aliot ne puranic lekhan kaa bhi kaaphi upyog kiya he, isamen bible, da book of kaaman prere, hindu vrihad aranyak upanishad or buddha kii fire saraman se kai chijen lee gayin hai
 In addition, facts have also been taken from cultural writings such as Sir James Fraser's The Golden Bow and Jesse Weston's From Rich to Romance
 aliot ne mul note main likhaa ki "na keval sheershak balki kavita kii yojana or pratikon kaa suzav miss jesi el weston ke dwaara diya gaya tha," lekin- tees saal baad-weston ne kavita ke nots main kai parivartan kiye, usne afsos vyakt kiya
 
 In addition to the West Land, Eliot used many symbols
 inamen fisher king, terro deck, perilas chapel or grel quest ke pratik shaamil hai
 The initial acceptable of the poem was of mixed type; Although many portrayed its universal despair and disgusting technique, others such as FL Lucas examined the first poem, while Charles Powell said it was just "a waste of paper"
 1922 main da dial ke liye edmund wilson kii "da poetry of drawt", ke bare main kai aalochak kehete hai ki kavita main ek prabhavi saranchana he jo bhaavnaatmak tatwon or jeevani ke uddharanon par jor detii he: Not only is life sterile and futile, but men have tasted its sterility and futility a thousand times before TS Eliot, walking the desert of London, feels profoundly that the desert has always been there
 Like Tiresias, he has sat below the wall of Thebes; like Buddha, he has seen the world as an arid conflagration; like the Sibyl, he has known everything and known everything in vain
 daraavnee kavitaaon ke lekhak ech pi lowecraft aliot kii kavita ko "vyaavhaarik rup se muhaavaron, sanketon uddharanon boliyon kaa ek arthhin sangrah bataate hai" or ek nirarthak parody likhte hai: west paper: a poyam of pro found incigniphicans"
 Critic Harold Bloom found that The West Land's pioneer is Alfred Lord Tennison's model: a monodrama
 yah vishesh rup se walt whitemen kii elegi wain lilakas last in da duuryaard bloom'da kii agrani he
 The dominant image of Eliot's poem is found in Whitman's Ode
 aliot kii kavita main "avastavik shahar", apni pratilipi, "priy bhai" or matra vilaap" kaa chithran sadhu ke geet ke rup main kiya gaya he
 One evening, Eliot read a part of the poem for the royal family during World War II, a few years later, the Queen Mother discussed it again: yahan ek shokakul vyakti ek suut main tha or vah ek kavita pard rahaa tha

 "the Burial of the Dead" is the title of the first volume of Eliot and is taken from the Book of Common Prayer, the Church of England Prayer Book
 "da bariyal of da ded" ke duusare khand main shaktiheen meri kii aawaaj sunai detii he jo lekhak kii aawaaj ban jaati he
 The first twelve lines of this volume consist of three Old Testaments and the author finds himself in a summer drought where the land has turned into a desert
 use "san of da main " kaha gaya he, jo hebrew kii bible main aam he, kabhi kabhi yah kisi vyakti arthath kisi vyakti ke putr=maanav ko ingit karata ho, lekin kabhi kabhi ek vishisht aadmi kii or sanket kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye ajekil, jise gold ke dwaara israel ko chetavanee dene ke liye pashchaatap kiya jaataa he
 The same title is also used in the New Testament, primarily Jesus himself using it when he is predicting his death and return, or announcing his decision to come
 ajekil main bhagwaan ant main sant ko bataata he ki israel nahin badalegaa; isliye unke swarup samaapt ho jaayenge, unki chhavi khatm ho jaayegi or unke shahar barbaad ho jaayenge
 aikalecystas kii pustak main, bhagwaan yahudee logon ko chetavanee dete hai ki unhen apane budhaape ke liye apane yauvan ke dinon ko yaad rakhana chahie, "dar maarg main bana rahegaa" or "dharti par dhul laut aayegi" 
 Gish expresses these writings with the lines "dead land, broken images, fear and dust, all take on the significance of human failure" After a dismal sequence of events, the author finds shelter under a mysterious "red rock" Which, for the coming Messiah, would be "like a river of water in a dry place, like the shadow of a big rock in a land

 Dante writes, "there was an infinite train of souls, i wonder how many deaths can happen together?"
 dante bheed main ek kaa vivaran dete hai jise ve jaanate hai, ve likhte hai "maine ek kii chaaya dekhi, jo kaayar tha, jisane inkaar kar diya" 
 The "great denial" to which Dante refers refers to the lack of selection of good or evil
 ve kabhi bhi jivit rahe bina hi mar gaye; iske alaava, ve narak yaa swarg main nahin gaye, unke paas jivan main paap yaa punya kaa koi chunaav nahin tha

 Then, as soon as the mixture of hydrogen and ammonia gas from the evaporator reaches the absorber cell, a fine spray of water is found in it
 isse ammonia gas to pani main ghul jaati he tathaa pani main aviley hydrogen vaashpitra main waapas laut jaataa he
 Here, the ammonium hydroxide enters the evaporator and restores the action cycle

 Jack Keruac wrote the phrase "beat Generation" in 1948 to mark an alleged underground, anti-homicide youth movement in New York
 Introduced

 Keruac allows this original form to have street hustler Herbert Hunkel who used the phrase "beat", as in an earlier discussion with him

 The origins of the Beat Generation unearthed Columbia University and may be the meeting of Keruac, Ginsburg, Lucian Carr, Hal Chase and others

 The beats are generally regarded as anti-academic, formed in response to many of his ideas, such as professors like Lionel Trillian and Mark Van Doren

 He said he was given the option of advocating insanity to avoid a prison sentence, and he met Carl Solomon where he was committed to 90 days at Bellevue Hospital

 In his first public reading, Ginsburg performed the just-finished first part of the howl

 Since the 1956 publication of "howl", it was also a marker of the beginning of the Beat movement and in 1957 brought its obscenity test to nationwide attention

 Keruac was impressed with Snyder and they were close for a number of years
 1955 ke vasant main ve snidar ke mil vaili cabin main ek saath rahete the
 Most beats were urban and they found Snyder almost foreign, with his rural background and wilderness experience, as well as his education in cultural anthropology and Oriental languages

 Burrows was in love with Lucian Carr, introduced to the group by David Kammerer

 Carr also met with Burroughs in 1944, through which he knew Keruac's girlfriend Eddie Parker

 One of his last, Dulo's arrogance, once again wrote about the incident twice in his first novel, Town and City, and Keruac in his own works
 unhone kaha, baroj ke saath ek sahyog upanyaas likhaa tha "and da hippos var boild in der tenks" hatya ke vishay main
 Gary Snyder was an important member of the Hara movement
 gairi snidar vyapak rup se lekhakon kii beet peedi sarkal ke ek sadsy ke rup main mana jaataa he: vah prasiddh chah gailaree ghatana main padhaa ki kaviyon main se ek tha, or kerua sabase lokapriy upanyaason, "dharma bams" main se ek ke bare main likhaa gaya tha
 Some critics argue that Snyder's connection with Beats is exaggerated and that he can be better regarded as a member of the West Coast group San Francisco Renaissance, which is independently developed

" The "primitive social practices" were blinding and directionless disappearance

 His reasoning was that this ideology of Beats promotes criminal practices in the society
 beats ke sadasyon par lagaae gaye aaropon main se ek tha ki, ve "jivan" va "sahitya" ke bich ke antar ko samaapt karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 In response to this, Ginsberg said in a 1958 documentary "the Village Vice", "we are being accused of a hollow allegation of intellectual disharmony
" hamane bhi in tikaakaron kii bhanti unhi shaalaaon main vidya pai jaha buddha jivi bhi hote the
 Podhoretz is also rooted in the literature of eighteenth century in the twentieth century, so his outlook is backward

 Russian Karanjia was a journalist and editor of India
 unka vaastavik naam 'rustam khurshedji karanjia' tha
 He was the founder editor of an English weekly newspaper called 'blitz'
 patrakarita jagat ke nirbhik mahamanav roosi karanjia kii yaad aate hi uparokt panktiyaan barabas hothon par aa jaati hai
 When a journalist brother heard the above lines in Russian, the Russian Karanjia's face was awash with a bright aura of smile
 unke aasapaas baithe log chakit the- unki akruti kii urjamaayi chhavi dekhakar
 Russian Karanjia had seen ninety five spring
 duniya ko dikhaa chuke the ki nirbhik evam swatantra patrakarita ke maane kya hote hai, kitne or kya-kya hote hai uske pahalu or parakram
 He had to go to sleep, but he left his legacy, but on his departure, a challenging question mark has emerged - is there any lion's chested hero in this media, who can further obstruct the Russian Karanjia? Russian Karanjia is considered the father of tabloid journalism in India
 sahi arthon main ve desh ke pratham khoji patrkaar the
 At a time when all newspapers were wearing the 'arrangement letter', Karanjia's newspaper was spreading the system
 jin vyavastha - purushon ke kaale karnaamon kaa karanjia ne pardaafash kiya unhone unki khoji patrakarita ko 'pit patrakarita' qaraar dene kii lakh koshishen kii
 But they had no effect - neither on Karanjia's health nor on the strength of the 'blitz', nor on the readers' fervor
 'blitj' kaa matlab hi - akraman, dhaava, chadhaai
 Whatever the organ or component of the system, it was awe to hear the name of 'blitz'
 'blitj' samachar patr ke pathakon kii pehali pasand hota tha
 Russian Karanjia never let the fearless and independent character of 'blitz' weekly be distracted or tarnished

 On the death of Moraes, he had said - After Frank's creation, Bhagavan broke his mold

 adhik jaankaree ke liye dekhen : vikipedia amukt saamagree The Maheshwar Sutra is considered to be the basis of Sanskrit grammar
 panini ne sanskrit bhashaa ke tatkaaleen swaroop ko parishkrut evam niyamit karne ke uddeshy se bhashaa ke vibhinn avyavon evam ghatakon yatha dhwani-vibhaag, naam, pad, aakhyaat, kriya, upsarg, avyay, vaakya, ling ityadi tathaa unke antarsambandhon kaa samavesh ashtaadhi main kiya he
 Ashtadhyayi has 32 footers which are equally divided into eight chapters
 vyakaran ke is mahneey granth me panini ne vibhakti-pradhan sanskrit bhashaa ke vishaal kalevar kaa samgr evam sampoorn vivechan lagbhag 4000 sutron main kiya he, jo aath adhyyon main vibhajit hai
 Keeping in mind the misbehavior of writing material in the society then, Panini has taken the help of sutra style to make the grammar memorable
 punah, vivechan ko atishay sankshipt banane hetu panini ne apane purvavarti vaiyakarnon se praapt upkarnon ke saath-saath swayan bhi anek upkarnon kaa prayog kiya he jiname shivasutra yaa maheshwar sutara sabase mahatvapurn hai
 The origin of the Maheshwar Sutras is attributed to the Tandava dance performed by Lord Nataraja
 arthath:-"nrity ke avsaan par nataraj ne sanakaadi rishiyon kii siddhi or kaamana kaa uddhaar ke liye navpanch baar damru bajaayaa
 In this way, this web of fourteen Shivasutras appeared
 " Playing the fourteen times of Damru produced sounds in the form of fourteen sutras, the grammar was revealed by these sounds
 isaliye vyakaran sutron ke aadi-pravartak bhagwaan nataraj ko mana jaataa he
 Fame is that Maharishi Panini received these sutras with the blessings of Devadhidev Shiva which formed the basis of Paninian Sanskrit grammar

 In these 14 sutras all the characters of Sanskrit language have been included
 pratham 4 sutron main swar varnon tathaa shesh 10 sutara vyanjan varnon kii gananaa kii gayi he
 In short, vowels are called good and consonant letters are called hal
 ach evam hal bhi pratyaahaar hai
 Pratyahara means short statement
 ashtaadhi ke pratham adhyay ke pratham paad ke 71wein sutara ‘adirantyen saheta’ sutara dwaara pratyaahaar banane kii vidhi kaa panini ne nirdesh kiya he
 Adirantyen Saheta: The Adi Varna creates a pratyahar with the last Varna Varna, which gives a comprehensive understanding of the Adi Varna and the pre-conscious Varna Varna
 udhaaharan: ach = pratham maheshwar sutara ‘aiun’ ke aadi varna ‘a’ ko chaturth sutara ‘aiuch’ ke antim varna ‘ch’ se yoga karaane par ach pratyaahaar banataa he
 This good pratyahar makes sense of all the letters from its initial letter 'A' to the one who comes before it
 atah, Ach = ae u ॠ ॡ a a o o
 isi tarah hal pratyaahaar kii siddhi 5wein sutara haywarat ke aadi akshar ha ko antim 14 wein sutara hal ke antim akshar l ke saath milaane se hoti he
 As a result, uparyukt sabhi 14 sutron main antim varna ko panini ne it kii sangya di he
 Since it is a noun, these last characters are used only for contract to make pratyahar, but they are not counted in the grammatical process i

 they are not used

 jab samudaay ke anek vyakti ek saath ek hi tarah ke uddeshy kii purti ke liye praytn karte hai to vah ek samuhik ghatana hoti he jise ‘janariti’ kehete hai
 This 'janriti' keeps on transferring from one generation to the other, thus it gets more and more of a group's appreciation while being transferred, because the successful experience of each generation makes it even stronger, this is the 'practice'
 kabhi-kabhi maanav in prathaon kaa paalan kanoonon ke samaan karata he
 Because he is afraid of society, he is afraid of publicity and he is afraid of social exclusion
 jaisaaki uparyukt vivechna se spasht hi he ki samaaj se manyata praapt, peedi-dar-peedi hastaantarit hone vaali suvyavasthit, drudh janaritiyaan hi ‘prathaen’ kehalaati hai
 The practice is actually an established and accepted method of social action
 log ise isliye maanate hai ki samaaj ke adhiktar log usee vidhi ke anusaar bahut dinon se kaary yaa vyavhaar karte aa rahe hai
 Thus, 'practice' is an adult form of 'janriti', with which social opinion or acceptance is associated
 ‘pratha’ kaa sambandh ek lambe samay se prayog main laai jane vaali lok-ritiyon se hota he
 In other words, it includes actions that have been accepted for generations
 inhen prathao ke kaaran ham naveen kriyaaon ko karne main kuch hichkichaahat kaa anubhv karte hai
 a person's behavior is influenced by practices
 maikiveror pejake anusaar, Prof
 Bogaardas, giving the definition of practices and traditions as one, has said, sepirane bhi likhaa he, But from the above definition of Prof
 Bogardus, it should not be understood that tradition and tradition are the same
 vastav main inamen paryaapt bhinnata he
 Explaining the difference between these two, Ross wrote that, he
 '' pratha kii prakruti ko spasht karne ke liye isaki visheshtaon ko jaananaa aavashyak he- The basis of 'custom' is society, but it is not made intentionally, but it develops during social interaction
 ‘pratha’ vah janariti he, jo peedi-dar-peedi hastaantarit hoti rahati he
 It is followed only because many people have been following it for a long time
 ‘pratha’ vyavhaar kii ve reetiyaan hai jo anek pidiyon se chalati aati hai or is prakaar samooh main sthayitv praapt kar leti hai
 There is more and more opinion of the group or society behind it
 vastav main anek pidiyon kaa safal anubhav hi ise drudh banaata he
 The 'practice' is conservative, so it cannot be changed easily and the pace of change is very slow
 ‘pratha’ ko banane, chalaane tathaa ise todane waalon ko dand dene ke liye koi sanghathan yaa shakti nahin hoti
 It is the society that gives birth and implements it
 maanav ke har prrkaar ke vyavhaar ko niyantrit karne kii kshamta, prathaon main bahut badi maatra main hoti he
 In human life, from childhood to death, they have an impact
 pratha kii prakruti ko spasht karne ke liye ginsburg ne ‘pratha’ or ‘aadat’ main antar karnaa aavashyak samajha he
 You wrote that, ginsburgke anusaar ‘pratha kii prakruti ko bhaleebhanti samajhane ke liye ‘pratha’ kaa ‘fishan’ se bhi antar samaj lenaa hoga
 It is sometimes said that fashion is an instantaneous analogy of a verb; That is, by its effect, every person does what every other man is doing; And thus it is based on simulation
 par ‘pratha’ to kriya kii kramik samanta he
 In other words, each person does what has always been done by working according to the practice and thus the practice is essentially based on habit
 lekin donon main isse kahin adhik mahatvapurn antar bhi he
 First of all, the practice seems to be related to the basic needs of the society, which always exists; While the influence of fashion is reflected in less poignant and less common areas of life
 fishan anivaary rup se gatisheel or parivartansheel hota he
 In fact, fashion is a series of recurring changes and is often characterized by imitation and innovation
 iske vipareet, pratha anivaary rup se susthir or bagaiyr toote chalane vaali hoti he
 And change in it always happens slowly
 isamen sandeh nahin ki kuch fishan aise bhi hote hai jo badalte nahin hai, lekin aisa hone par vastav main ve fishan nahin rahete, balki pratha ban jate hai
 In other words, they get the respect of both past and present
 duusari baat yah he ki pratha or fishan main prerak tatv pruthak-pruthak hote hai
 


 The practice follows that in the past, it has often been followed, whereas fashion is currently being followed
 iske atirikt, fishan ek tarah se naveenta kaa dyotak hota he or iskaa anivaary aadhaar apane ko duusare se pruthak karne kii utkar ichha main paaya jaataa he
 On the contrary, the emphasis of the practice is very much based on the fact that by this society can protect itself from the dangers of innovation
 arthath pratha kaa aadhaar apane ko dusron ke ateet ke or puraatan ke samaan kar lene kii ichha hoti he
 Generally, practices and public practices are considered the same
 parantu vastav main ye donon hi bhinn-bhinn vichaar hai
 Practices are actually their own developed forms rather than public pleasures
 samooh kaa koi bhi vyavhaar tab tak pratha kaa rup dhaaran nahin kar saktaa, jab tak ki use saamaajik sweekruti praapt na ho
 In this form, the generals can be called the first step of collective behavior and practices are the second step
 iske atirikt prathaen janaritiyon kii tulana main adhik sthaayee or shaktishaalee bhi hoti hai
 Not only this, as an instrument of social control, the importance of practices far exceeds that of the generals
 pratha kii utpatti ekaek yaa ek din main nahin hoti
 The development of any practice takes place slowly and over a period of time
 dainik jivan main manushya ke saamne anek naveen aavashyaktaayen aati rahati hai
 There are some of these which are related to most of the people of the group
 isliye is prakaar kii saamaanya aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke sadhano ko doundh nikaalane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 This instrument first comes to an individual's mind in the form of an idea or concept
 vyakti apane is vichaar ke anusaar kaary karata he or yah jaanane kii koshish karata he ki us tareeke se us aavashyaktaa kii purti ho sakati he yaa nahin
 If he is successful in this endeavor, then he repeats it again and again when the same need arises in future
 baar-baar dohraane se vah uski vyaktigat aadat ban jaati he
 When others see the first person's successful behavior or method of action; So they also adopt that method
 jab vyavhaar kii vah vidhi samaaj main fail jaati he to use janariti kehete hai
 When Janriti is transferred from one generation to another, it is called custom
 is prakaar ek vichaar se vyaktigat aadat, vyaktigat aadat se janariti or janariti se pratha kii utpatti yaa vikaas hota he
 Thus both past and present contribute to the origin of the practice
 vunt ne likhaa he, According to Mr
 Ginsberg this statement is true in the sense that custom is the creation of a composite creation and thousands of interactions
 lekin isse yah na samajhnaa chahie ki pratha ke peeche kisi mahamastishk yaa samaaj kii saamaanya aatma kaa astitv hota he
 In the end, the practice is born by mixing other personal habits with a personal habit
 unamem se prayek kii aadat kaa duusare se prabhavit hote rahane or duusare ko prabhavit karte rahane kaa hi fal he ki ant main ek sanyukt upaj ke rup main uskaa swaroop sthir ho jaataa he
 This is what we call custom
 jaisaaki hobahouse ne likhaa he- The importance of practice in social life cannot be denied in any way
 vastav main adikalin athwa saral samaajon main inkaa mahatv rajkeey kanoon se bhi adhik hota he
 There is a particular reason for this and that is that in simple societies the life of individuals is highly conservative, as well as highly influenced by religion
 atah ve pratha kaa ulanghan kisi bhi rup main nahin kar pate
 In addition, since the practice is passed on from generation to generation, its violation is considered an insult to the ancestors
 nimnlikhti vivechna se pratha kaa yah mahatv or bhi spasht ho jayega
 Fail and therefore social needs are not met by them
 aisi prathaen bahudhaa samaaj kii pragati main baadhak bhi ho jaati hai
 But we should not get confused by seeing the practice of some unhelpful practices that the practices are meaningless and meaningless
 prathaon kaa saamaajik niyantran main atyadhik mahatv he
 Practices control a person's behaviors to a great extent
 yadhyapi inke peeche aisi koi kanoonee shakti nahin hoti jiske dwaara vyaktiyon par unke manwaane ke liye dabaav daalaa ja sake, phir bhi manushya saamaajik ninda ke bhay se prathaon kaa ulanghan nahin kar paata
 Since the practices are successful experiences of previous generations, one quickly accepts them because he has a feeling of hesitation and fear in carrying out new practices
 prathaon kaa prabhaav aadim or saral samaajon main to kanoonon se bhi adhik hota he
 a special reason for this is that the lives of individuals in these types of societies are highly conservative, as well as more influenced by religion
 atah ve pratha kaa ulanghan kisi bhi rup main nahin kar pate
 Additionally, since the practices are passed down from generation to generation, their violation is considered an insult to the ancestors
 prathaon ke isi vyapak prabhaav ko de khate hue shakespeare ne prathaon ko ‘krur pratha’, monten ne ‘gussebaaj va dagaabaaz skool-masterni’, bekan ne ‘manushya ke jivan kaa pradhan nyaayadhish’ or lock ne ‘prakruti se bhi badi shakti’ kaha he
 Ginsberg wrote describing the role that practices play in social control, isiilie to prathaon ko saamaajik abhimati praapt hoti he or iske bal par hi ye vyakti ke vyavhaaron ko niyantrit va sanchalit karti hai or is prakaar saamaajik niyantran main sahaayak hoti hai
 The ancient society was small and simple and each person knew each other very personally
 saath hi, saamaajik jivan main na to parivartan shighrata se hota tha or na hi saamaajik samasyaayen gambheer thim
 Therefore, it was through practices that social control was easily done
 parantu aadhunik samaaj main prathaen bilkul aparyaapt hai or keval inke dwaara saamaajik niyantran aaj asambhav he
 There are four major reasons for this - is prakaar yah spasht he ki aadhunik samaaj ke liye prathaen aparyaapt hai or inke dwaara saamaajik niyantran kaa sampoorn kaary kadaapi nahin kiya ja saktaa he; yahi kaaran he ki aaj prathaon kaa mahatv din-pratidin ghatata ja rahaa he or kanoon kaa mahatv bad rahaa he
