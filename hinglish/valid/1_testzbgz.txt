 aseergarh madhyapradesh ke burhanpur jile main sthit ek gaanv he
 The historical fort of Asirgarh is very famous
 aseergarh qila burhanpur se lagbhag 20 kilometre kii duuri par uttar disha main satapura pahadiyon ke shikhar par samudr sataha se 250 foot kii oonchaai par sthit he
 Even today, this fort is singing the glory of its glorious past with a free speech
 isaki tatkaaleen aparajeyata swayan siddh hoti he
 It is counted among the few famous world famous fortresses, who were considered to be rare and invincible
 itihaaskaaron ne iskaa 'bab-e-dakkhan' or 'kalod-e-dakkhan' ke naam se ullekh kiya he, kyonki is qile par vijay praapt karne ke pashchaat dakshin kaa dwaar khul jaataa tha, or vijeta kaa sampoorn khandesh kshetra par adhipaty sthapit ho jaataa tha
 When and who founded this fort cannot be said with confidence
 itihaaskaar spasht evam sahi raay rakhane main vivash rahe hai
 Some historians relate this fort to the place of worship of Ashwatthama, son of the heroic warrior guru Dronacharya of Mahabharata, his immortality
 burhanpur ke 'gupteshwar mahadev mandir' ke sameep se ek sundar surang he, jo aseergarh tak lambii he
 It is said that on the festival day, Ashwatthama comes to bathe in the Tapti River, and later returns to his place after worshiping 'gupteshwar'
 kuch itihaaskaar ise ramayana kaal kaa bataate hai
 According to the famous historian 'mohammad Qasim', it was constructed by a person named 'asha Ahir'
 aashaa ahir ke paas hazaron kii sankhya main pashu the
 Such a safe place was needed for their safety
 kehete hai, vah is sthaan par pandrahavin shatabdi main aayaa tha or is sthaan par it mitti, chuunaa or pattharon kii diwaar banaakar rahane laga
 In this way, this fort became famous as Asirgarh in the name of Asha Ahir
 aseergarh kuch samay ke liye chouhan vansh ke raajaaon ke aadhipaty main bhi rahaa tha, jiskaa ullekh raajapootaana ke itihaaskaaron ne sandarbh main kiya hai
 After some time the fame of the Asirgarh Fort spread far and wide
 firozshah tululaq ke ek sipaahi malik khaan ke putr naseer khaan faaruqi ko aseergarh kii prasiddhi ne prabhavit kiya
 He came to Burhanpur
 usne aashaa ahir se bhent kar nivedan kiya ki "mere bhai or balkana ke zamidaar mujhe pareshaan karte rahete hai, evam meri jaan ke dushman bane hue hai
 Therefore, you help me and allow my family members to stay in this safe place, then it will be kind
 "asha Ahir was a generous person, believing Nasir Khan's word and ordered him to stay in the fort
 naseer khaan ne pehle to kuch doliyon main mahilaon or bacchon ko bhijwaya or kuch main hathiyaaron se susajjit sipaahi yoddhaon ko bheja
 Asha Ahir and her sons came to welcome
 jaise hi doliyon ne qile main pravesh kiya, doliyon main se nikalakar ekadam aashaa ahir or uske putron par hamalaa kiya gaya or unhen maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 In this way, Nasir Khan Farooqi got authority on this fort
 adilshaah faaruqi ke dehanth ke baad aseergarh kaa qila bahadurshah ke adhikaar main aa gaya tha
 He was not a far-sighted king
 usne apni or qile kii suraksha ke liye koi vyavastha nahin kii thi samraat akbar aseergarh kii prasiddhi sunakar is kile par apana adhipaty sthapit karne ke liye vyakul ho rahaa tha
 He migrated south
 jaise hi bahadurshah faaruqi ko is baat kii soochna mili, usne apni suraksha ke liye qile main aisi shaktishaalee vyavastha kii, ki das varshon tak qila ghira rahane par bhi baahar se kisi vastu kii aavashyaktaa nahin padi
 Emperor Akbar started attacking Asirgarh, and closed all the routes of the fort
 vah qile par raat-din topon se golabari karne laga tha
 Thus the order of war continued continuously, but Akbar had to face failure every time
 usne apane paramarshdaataaon se vichaar-vimarsh kiya, tab yah nishchit hua ki bahadurshah se baatcheet kii jaae
 Message sent by messenger
 saath hi yah vishwaas bhi dilaayaa gaya ki bahadurshah par kisi bhi prakaar kii aanch nahin aegi
 Bahadur Shah believed Emperor Akbar
 vah usase bhent karne ke liye qile ke baahar aayaa
 Bahadur Shah Farooqi greeted and then the conversation started
 baatcheet chal hi rahi thi ki ek sipaahi ne peeche se bahadurshah par hamalaa kar diya or use jakhmi kar bandi bana liya
 He told Akbar "this is your betrayal of me"
 is par akbar ne kaha ki "raajnneeti main sab kuch jaij he
 "then Akbar filled the fort with the gold, silver, diamonds, pearls of the fortress and soldiers with political tricks and tricks
 in lobhiyon ne qile kaa dwaar khol diya
 Akbar's army entered the fort
 bahadurshah kii sena akbar kii sena ke saamne na tik saki
 In this way, on 17 January 1601 AD, Akbar conquered the fort of Asirgarh and hoisted the flag of Mughal rule on the fort
 akbar kii sena ne bahadurshah ke putron ko bandi bana liya
 Akbar sent Bahadur Shah Farooqui to the fort of Gwalior and his sons to keep it in other forts
 jis prakaar faaruqi badshaah ne is qile ko raajnneetik chaalon se, dhoortta se praapt kiya tha, thik usee prakaar yah qila bhi unke haathon se jaataa rahaa tha
 Thus after the Mughal suzerainty was established over Asirgarh and Burhanpur, the Farooqi dynasty collapsed
 prasiddh itihaaskaar farishta likhata he ki, "akbar jaise samraat badshaah ko bhi aseergarh qile ko hasil karne ke liye 'sone kii chaabi' kaa upyog karnaa pada tha"
 After the reign of Akbar, this fort remained in the possession of the Marathas from 1760 AD to 1819 AD
 maraathon ke patan ke pashchaat yah qila angrezon ke aadhipaty main aa gaya
 The English Army resided here since 1904 AD
 aseergarh kaa qila teen vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 The upper part is called Asirgarh, the middle part is Kamargarh and the lower part is called Malayagarh
 is qile tak pahunchne ke liye do raste banaaye gayi hai
 One is in the east direction, which is a simple terraced path, and the other is in the north direction, which is extremely difficult and painful
 yah maarg vaahanon ke liye he
 Walls have been built on both sides of the roadway to protect the vehicle
 yah maarg ek badi khai ke paas samaapt ho jaataa he
 There is a big gate, which is famous as 'madar Darwaza'
 neeche se qile kii oonchaai dekhakar himmat baith jaati he ki, itani oonchaai par chadhnaa kathin hoga, parantu qile ko dekhne kii ichha, sharir ko sfoort karti he evam ek nai shakti or utsaah bhar detii hai
 As we go uphill, the natural beauty of the surrounding attracts the heart
 in sundar drishyon main qile par chadhne vaala vyakti itnaa magn ho jaataa he, ki use is baat kaa ahsaas tak nahin hota he, ki vah kitni oonchaai par pahunch gaya he
 Humans are surprised to see the maze-filled path of the fort
 qile ke is vicitra rang ko dekhte hue jab aage jaaen, to qile kaa pehla dwaar nazar aata he
 Some far east direction from this door, hidden in the long grass, two different sources of water named ganga-yamuna, whose water is very clean and sweet, no one knows where the water comes from
 pani main bani seedhiyaan spasht nazar aati hai, or aage tak rasta bhi nazar aata he
 Fear is felt when you move forward
 aisa lagata he ki yahan koi gupt maarg qile ke kisi na kisi bhaag tak avashya jaataa hoga
 In front of this door is a black rock, on which four inscriptions of Akbar, Daniyal, Aurangzeb and Shah Jahan are installed in Persian language
 in shilalekhon par qile ke qiledaron par vijay praapt karne waalon or soobedaaron ke naam ke saath anya varnan ankit he
 It is known from the inscription of Shahjahan that, during his tenure, some buildings were built here
 is chattan ke paas jo daravaaza he, use rajagopaldaas ne, jo qile kaa soobedaar tha, banwaaya tha
 Standing from here, beautiful views of the surroundings attract the heart
 qile kii deevaaron par or darwaazon par thode-thode antar se choti topein sthapit kii gai thim
 As soon as entering the top of the fort, there is a huge ground on the front, on which the grass appears to have grown
 kisi samay yahan kheti kii jaati thi, parantu ab yah vishaal maidan yun hi viraan padaa he
 Moving forward, the two towers of the mosque of Asirgarh are clearly visible
 yahi aseergarh kii 'jama masjid' he
 This mosque is built entirely of black stone
 yah bhavy masjid faaruqi shashan kaal kii nirmaan kala kaa utkrisht namoona he evam yaadgaar he
 This mosque was built 5 years before the Jama Masjid in Burhanpur
 is masjid kii lambaai 935 foot or chaudai 40 foot he
 Its roof is based on 50 pillars
 isaki 13 mehraaben or 4 dalan hai
 Its arched doors are also of stone
 yahan lagbhag 1200 aadmi ek saath aasaani se namaaz padh sakate hai
 In front of the mosque is a large terrace, on which three sides of the stone verandah have been made
 masjid ke madhyabhaag kii mehrab ke upree bhaag par arabi bhashaa kaa ek shilaalekh he, jisamen faaruqi vansh ke sulatanon kaa vansh evam masjid kaa nirmaan varsh 992 hijri ankit he
 The arches at the northern corner have a Sanskrit inscription similar to the inscription of Jama Masjid of Burhanpur
 isse masjid kaa nirmaan varsh aadi gyaat hota he
 On the front pillar, an inscription was inscribed by the emperor Akbar in Persian, which describes the victory over Asirgarh
 is shilaalekh ko us samay ke prasiddh lekhaakaar 'mohammad maasoom' ne pathar par taraasha tha
 There is a square stone platform in the central part of the mosque, with a large iron screw on it
 bataaya jaataa he ki is lohe ke darvaaze ke neeche ek gupt rasta he, jo qile ke baahar jaataa he
 This path is so wide that the horse can easily pass through it
 iske bare main yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki, yah bhumigat gupt rasta burhanpur tak jaataa tha
 The British discovered this path, but were unsuccessful
 masjid ke dalan se lage hue ek jaise do minaaren hai, jo lagbhag 80 foot unche hai
 To reach the top of these towers, a curved path is made of stairs
 masjid ke pravesh dwaar ke bai taraf ek kuna he, jiskaa pani, meetha, thanda evam svachh he
 It has an iron chain
 neeche utarane par abhas hota he ki, yahan vishaal tal ghar he
 Departing from the mosque, in the eastern northern part of the fort there is an ancient temple on the front side
 yah mandir mahabharat kaaleen ashwatthama kaa puja sthal bataaya jaataa he
 Nandi sits outside the temple, and has Shivling and idols in front of him
 is mandir main bhi ek gupt rasta bataaya jaataa he, jo qile ke baahar pehle darvaaze se kuch dur ganga-yamuna main aakar samaapt ho jaataa he
 It is possible that this secret passage has been made to enter the enemy's fortress and to attack him from behind by deception
 nirantar prakritik ghatnaon ke ghatit hote rahane ke uparaant bhi yah mandir ab tak vidyaman he
 In fact, this fort is a wonderful act of surprise for the work done by humans, which is its own example
 aseergarh ke neeche lagbhag ek hazaar kii aabaadi vaala gram he, jo aseergarh ke naam se prasiddh he
 Badanagar was inhabited here in the sixteenth century, and it was famous only for the tenancy of grapes, whose grapes were sold far and wide till 1870 AD
 parantu aaj in angooron kii kaasht dekhne ko ankhen tarasati hai
 Kashi of Mahua has taken his place
 gram aseergarh main bhi faaruqi kaal kii choti-si masjid he
 There is an inscription on the southern wall inside the mosque, with rectangles inscribed on it
 purv main masjid khandit ho chuki thi
 The people of the city and the village have collected it and rebuilt it
 yahan kii sadak ke pashchim main thode faasale par shiv kaa bhavy pracheen mandir he, jo kaale pathar dwaara nirmit he
 The temple is still in good condition

 apart from government officials come and stay

 This tomb is of Hazrat Shah Noman

 a beautiful terraced path has been built to reach the tomb
 yahan se kuch duuri par motimahal kii imaarat he
 She is also said to be the Mughal carpet

 Due to which the work of repair etc
 continues

 In 1834, Faraday published some of his numerical observations related to electrotherapy
 inhen farade ke vidyut apghaton ke niyam kehete hai
 There are two rules under this
 pathyapustakon or vaigyanik sahitya main main in niyamon ko alag-alag tareeke se prastut kiya jaataa he lekin vahudha prachlit rup kuch is prakaar he- In electrical decomposition, the amount of material deposited on the electromagnets is proportional to the volume of the current
 'dhara kii maatra' kaa arth aavesh se he na ki vidyut dhara se
 When the quantity of current is equal, the amount of material deposited / removed on the electronegative is proportional to the equivalent weight of that element
 farade ke niyamon ko sankshep main is prakaar likh sakate hai - Where dhyatvy he ki m / z jamaa hue padaarth kaa tulyanki bhaar he
 For Faraday's first rule, M, F, and z are assigned; Hence the higher the Q, the more m
 farade ke dwitiya niyam ke liye, Q, F, tathaa z niyatank hai; at: m / z jitna hi adhik hoga, m bhi utana hi adhik hoga
 If a simple situation is spoken in which the electric current is fixed, then q = i t { \ displaystyle q = It} and jahaan But if the moving current is flowing, then the value of the total charge q will be equal to the relative integration of time to stream i τ { \ displaystyle \ tau}: nadikhairavadi main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke karnulu jile kaa ek gaanv he

 film kaa aarambh san 2016 isa purv ko saraman or hojo evam unke doston se hoti he, jab vah amari kii pracheen gaanv ke yuva, apni naav main safar karte hue tang nadi main ja funsate hai
 And they are suddenly attacked by cannibal crocodiles
 saraman behad sahaspurn dhang se apane bhaale se ladata he or unhen maar daalata he
 Then, after carrying them, they return to the village where they cheer as heroes
 saraman ko us raat neend nahin aati: jab bachapan main uske mata-pita ko kho detaa he, uske man main ab bhi kai dinon se apane chachee kii gunagunaahat gunjati mahasoos hoti he, or jab sapane dekhtaa he to use ek seengvaala vicitra pashu or mohenjo daaro ke vishaal nagar kii jhalak dikhaai padati
 However, his uncle never allows Sarman's decision to go to Mohenjo Daro
 aakhirkaar uske chachaa haar maanate he, or salaah dete he ki mohenjo daaro ek bahut nirmam nagar he or saraman ko kisi par bhi bharose par ehtiyaat baratane ko kehete he
 His uncle used to give him a dirty mess which tells him to use it only when he is alive or when he dies
 tamaam maal-asabaab ke saath vyapaar ko niklaa saraman jyon hi mohenjo daaro pahunchataa he to vah nagar kii vishalata or vaibhav dekh awak rah jaataa he
 The market here attracts unseen and unique goods and livestock sales from Macedonian and Sumerian and foreign traders
 saraman ko maaloom ho jaataa he ki mohenjo daaro ke shashan bagdor uske pramukh taanashaah maham or uske dusht bete munja ke haathon main he
 Maham proposes to raise additional taxes from farmers; On this proposal, all the mps of the city council give their support, who are the companions of Maham except the representatives of the agricultural farmers
 chunaav biit jaataa he or jab kisaanon ke pratinidhi maham kii karatuuton kaa benakaab karte hue dhamkaate hue yah puchhate he – ki kyon aakhir maham ko padosi nagar hadappa ne unako tadeepaar karaayaa – maham tatkaal unhen maar daalata he
 On the other hand, Sarman meets a beautiful girl named Chani, the daughter of Mohenjo Daro's head priest and she will choose only 'one' who will liberate the city and bring a new dawn
 is tarah vah mohenjo daaro ke kisaanon ke saath maham ke is nae kar ke viruddh baghawat kaa netritv karata he vah nagar ke sambhraant varg main apane chachaa ke die tabiz ke kaaran jagah bana letaa he, jab vah chaani ko gussell ghode ke prahaar ko bachaa letaa he, tab vah uske pita se miltaa he, pramukh purohit, is mulaakaat ke baad hi use pahchaan letaa he
 Sarman and Chani are unable to express their mutual love in front of the people, but Chani's tearful statement that he is being forcibly married to Munja
 nav chandramaa ke utsav par yojit nrity dauraan hi maham ko saraman or chaani ek-duusare se prem karte hai or ye bhi ki saraman hi kar virodhiyon kaa netaa he
 Maham immediately declares the death penalty to Sarman but realizes that he has the support of the public, then Maham avoids the punishment and very deviously challenges Sarman to play goat-zokhar
 saraman ke saamne yahi prastaav rakhaa jaataa he ki yadi vah vijayi hua to chaani ko is sagaai se mukt kar degaa
 And he accepts it
 pramukh purohit karawas main saraman se miltaa he
 He tells that Mahim was despised due to the illicit trade of Sheesham in Harappa with the Sumerians
 maham anya saudagaron ke bhaanti hi mohenjo daaro daakhil hua or dekhte hi dekhte is dhandhe ke kaaran nagar parishad tak apni pahunch bana sakaa
 At the same time, Maham has accumulated extensive gold reserves in the great Indus River and then Mahm proposes to build a dam in the river with a big plan and the gold mine finds another way and starts depositing in the chest of Mohenjo Daro
 
 shrujan naamak budhimaan va eemaandaar pradhan is yojana kaa virodh karata he lekin maham kisi tarah use naakaam karata he or baandh kaa nirmaan karwaata he
 Mahm arrests Shrujan by false accusation of gold hoarding
 use is baat kaa behad pachhtaawaa hota he ki kaise unako va durjan ko maham kii dhamkiyaan milti thi yadi unhone virdohi shrujan kii sahaytaaki to
 Shrujan is killed

 Therefore, if the particle of mass m is moving in a uniform circular motion, the value of the centripetal force acting on it will be given by the following formula: f = − m v 2 r u ^ r = − m ω 2 r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {F} =-{ \ frac {mv^{2}}{r}}{ \ hat { \ mathbf {u} }}_{r}=-m \ omega ^{2} \ mathbf {r} } The epithet is a grammar in which an object is called in which something is called by its own name, rather than by a characteristic or other thing related to it

 India which is India is a union of states sangh rajow ke samjhaute se nahin bana he atah ve sangh se pruthak hone kaa adhikaar bhi nahin rakhte, atah sangh avinashya he Only those states which belong to the Union Center are part of it and not the Union Territory Article 3 states that Parliament has the right to change the name and area of the state, but the Parliament will implement it only by the rules mentioned in the Constitution

 moulik adhikaar nagariko ke adhikaar he inako america samvidhan ke bill of rhite se liya gaya he
 The reason for these rights being maulika is- The First Amendment was challenged in Shankari Prasad v
 Union of India suit 1951, when the Supreme Court, interpreting Article 13, gave two legislative powers of Parliament - saamaanya jiskaa prayog se bana act vidhi kahalaayegaa savaidhanik – jiska prayog karne par sanshodhan utpann hogayah shakti nirmaan kaari shakti he tathaa samvidhan nirmaatri sabha ne sansad ko is liye di thi taaki vah samay aane par savidhan m parivartan laa sake
 The first is only a sign of general power and by using it, the Parliament cannot amend the fundamental rights, but in the exercise of the powers of Article 368, the fundamental rights will also be subject to amendment
 yah sthiti golkanath banaam punjab rajya vaad 1967 tak rahi parantu is vaad ke nirnay m supreme court ne moulik adhikaron ko asanshodhaneey bataa diya koi bhi satta yahan tak ki sansad bhi un main sanshodhan nahin kar sakati he yah adhikaar to maatr naveen samvidhan sabha ko hi diya ja saktaa he
 In the decision of this suit, Article 368 was stated to be only constitutional amendment process and not constitutional amendment power, till that time the title of Article 368 was constitution amendment process
 In response to this decision, Parliament passed the 24th Amendment and Article 13 and Article 368 The amended composition of Article 13 declared that the amendment passed by Parliament under Article 368 will not have anything to do with Article 13, similarly the title of Article 368 is amended

 The question of the validity of the 24th amendment was raised in the Keshavanand Bharti vs State of Kerala
 In its decision, the Supreme Court declared this amendment valid, and considered the Parliament to be an authority to amend any part of the constitution and the decision of the Golaknath suit Scrapped, but Supreme Court did not consider the parliamentary power to amend, the amendment destroyed the basic structure of the constitution or Cannot be paused even though it is free to amend any Article

 Article 368 To remove ambiguity, it is declared that there is no restriction on the amending power of Parliament

 But the rights given in Article 20,21 cannot be withdrawn in any case
 The type of distinction in the provisions of Articles 358 and 359, Article 358 1 The rights to Article 2, effective only due to war or external aggression, will be automatically suspended
 The executive of the executive cannot apply until the national emergency is in force
 Article 359 1 a separate order of the President may come into force for the emergency for any reason

 For this, he will use the principle of natural justice, thus this process makes the court more powerful
 DU process means that the process is fair, logical, Be just and not prejudiced and free of charge, the Indian constitution only talks about the procedure established by law, but in Maneka Gandhi case, the Supreme Court said that natural justice is enshrined in Article 21 and thus it is due in due process
 According to these principles, no person will be a judge in his own case
 It will not get punishment without hearing
 3 The working establishment will work without any discrimination
 It is said that the act should be supported by logic
 This principle is universal
 According to the Supreme Court, the judiciary is also subject to them
 It is the fundamental right of the individual and private
 It is applicable against individuals organizations, it is not built by the constitution but it is pre-contained in the central In 1986, the Supreme Court in the Inland Water Transport Case brought this principle in par with Article 14 anu 21 yah anu 86 ve sanshodhan 2002 dwaara sthapit kiya gaya he yah anu praathmik shiksha ko 6 se 14 ayuvarg hetu ek moulik adhikaar banaata he ye shiksha nickshulk tathaa anivaary hogiisi ke dwaara ek nayaa moulik kartavya 51 e sthapit kiya gaya he jo parijanon hetu apane 6 se 14 aayu varg ke bacchow hetu shiksha praapt karne de The relative or any acquaintance shall have the right to inform about his arrest

 Intrinsic consciousness means the right to follow internal consciousness
 This right is uninterrupted when the inner consciousness is external

 The promotion of XOA is for the education of others
 In the case of Stenisal v
 Madhya Pradesh, the propaganda is just the propagation of the forwarding of ideas and its recognition, but the right of conversion is not fundamental

 The development of horses was a slow process

 After that, the development of horses at a slow pace came through many other animals

 The first Equus hyirakotirium was a small jungle animal of early Eocene

 It resembled a dog with short neck, short snout, short legs, and long tail

 This famous little equid was once known as the Iohippasaya "dorf Horse"

 Mesohippus had three toes on all his legs and still had pad legs
 chauthe morche ko pair kii anguli ek baaqi thunth kam ho gaya tha Soon Meosohippus celer and its very close relative Measohippus westoni appeared, a similar animal called Miohippus assiniboiensis was born, after about 36 million years ago
 ek theth miohippas saafe bada tha or ek misohippasaki tulana main thodaa bada khopadi tha
 The facial fossa was deeper and more expanded
 iske alaava, takhne sanyukt aasaani se badal gaya tha
 Miohippus also started to show a variable crest on its upper cheek teeth
 satraa lakh saal pehle, meryihippas rghode pankti main shaamil ho gaye
 The muzzle lengthened, the jaw deep, and moved back to the eyes to accommodate the roots of the larger teeth
 mastishk vishesh rup se bada tha, chaalaak or adhik chust pehle ghodon kii tulana main meryihippas kar rahi he
 Overall, this species was distinctly acceptable as a horse with a very "horsey" head
 lagbhag 15 karod saal pehle bich meosin yug main pilohippas, ek teen panje ghode paidaa hui
 The gradual loss of the side toes is seen in this species through three consecutive sections
 pilohippas bahut samaan tha or aikavs kaa pratyaksh purvaj mana do mahatvapurn matbhed ke liye chhodkar
 First, the Pylohippus' skull is the deep facial fossa, while the equus has no facial fossae at all
 doosraa, pilohippas' daant dridhtaa se ghumaavdaar hai lekin aikavs ' daant bahut sidhe hai
 Although Pylohippus apparently belongs to the Equus, the former probably did not give rise to the latter

 The first Equus was 13
2 tall, pony shaped, with a classic "horse" body - rigid spine, long neck, legs, and nose, and fused leg bones with no rotation

 Like Dinohippus, the Equus had a claw-side ligament that prevent twisting of the hoof

 Thakur Deshraj writes that Maharaj Surajmal had four queens
 jinase jawaharsingh, ratansingh, navalsinh, ranjitsingh or naharsingh paanch putr paidaa hue the
 It is said that Jawahar Singh and Ratansingh were from a Rajput queen, whose beauty Surajmal was married to her
 fadar bendil or imadussat kaa lekhak donon hi is baat kaa samarthan karte hai ki jawaharsingh kii maa ek raajaputaani thi
 Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, pg-648 maharaj surajmal apni sab raniyon main vir kishori rani kii, jiske koi santan nahin hui thi, adhik pyaar karte the
 Luckily Jawahar Singh was adopted by Rani Kishori and due to his influence and love, the rebellion-loving Jawahar Singh survived the wrath of his father
 armbh main navayuvak jawaharsingh ke hriday main yavan shaskaon ke liye baari ghrinaa thi
 He had reprimanded the Wazir of Dehli only for why he kissed his hand and defiled it? Maharaj Surajmal's desire was to make Nahar Singh his successor
 naharsingh apane pita kii aagyaakaari, gurujanon kaa sammaan karne vaala, namr or sada swabhaav kaa tha
 But he was not full of the qualities of fearlessness and bravery as required
 jawaharsingh ko na ishwar se bhay tha or na manushya se
 He was willing to face both man and God in fulfillment of his intentions and in revenge
 vah rankushal, prabandh karne main yogya, furtila, chatur tathaa vir hone ke kaaran janm se hi shaasha hone ke yogya tha
 But Maharaj Surajmal feared his constant fighting instincts that it is very possible to destroy the Jat caste
 isi se vah inhen jat-shakti arthath apana rajya nahin dena chaahate the
 Just as frugal as Maharaj Suraj Mal was, Jawahar Singh was just as wasteful
 yahi kaaran tha ki unhone apni ek alag party bana lee
 Separate court and army started keeping, which cost more than the money accepted to Surajmal
 maharaj surajmal ne jawaharsingh kii allhadpan-yukt veerta se khub laabh uthaaya

 At the same time, Jawahar Singh found some companions who instilled him against his father
 maharaj surajmal uske saathiyon ko dand dena chaahate the, isliye unhone deeg par chadhaai kii
 But Jawahar Singh considered it an insult and he came on the battlefield
 thode hi samay main unke saathi to bhaag khadey hue, lekin vah maidan main date rahe
 He was injured due to being surrounded by many people
 surajmal jo ki apane vir putr kii mrityu ke mukaable main haar janaa pasand karte the, ghayal putr ke paas lapakkar pahunche or apane pyaare putr ko chaati se laga liya
 Since then, he started loving Jawahar Singh a lot
 unki ladaaku-pravriti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue maharaj surajmal ne yah vichaar kiya ki jawaharsingh ko haryana praant kaa swatantra shaasha bana diya jaae
 If this idea of him was fulfilled, then Maharaja Jawahar Singh should come from the invaders from Punjab jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-649 The means kept on getting, and then the form of India would have been different

 i will climb with some of my army that i have and look back who is the heir of the father? With this threat, Nahar Singh left Bharatpur and Balaram considered it wise to become Jawahar Singh's companion

 In Vair, his cousin Bahadur Singh was looking to establish his independent princely state

 In order to give the Afghans a chance to get out, their army withdrew 4-6 Kos
 najibuddaula afgaanon ke saath baahar niklaa
 The Jats broke down on the Afghans like hungry wolves
 unhone afgaanon ko shahar main ghusaa diya
 Maharaja Jawahar Singh, along with Holkar and other chieftains, crossed the Jamuna and looted Shahdara
 jaaton kii 17 navambar kii topon kii ladaai se najeebakhaan kii senaayen maidan chhodkar kile main ghus gai
 Now the fort and the city began to be shelled
 teen maheene tak jat afgaanon kii naak main dam karte rahe
 On February 1765, while standing on the high ground near the entry of vegetable and cattle, the Afghans bombarded the Sikhs and the Jats
 kintu jat goliyon kii kuch bhi parvaah na karke afgaanon ke dal main ghus pade
 The Afghans were forced to flee again
 jab ki jawaharsingh ko purna vijay milane hi ko thi unke namakharaam dost malharav holkar ne unki aashaaon par pani pher diya
 Father Vendel writes - jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-651 Jawahar Singh was not pleased with this treaty
 vah malharav se khunas maanate hue deeg ko laut aae
 Nevertheless, in the Battle of Dehli, he was involved in looting many jewels and valuables
 “asht dhaati” naam kaa phatak jise ki chittod se musalmaan badshaah dehali main le gayi the aaj tak, bharatpur main chadha hua he
 The marble throne of Deeg is also present in the plunder of Delhi
 bharatpur ke dehaton main ab bhi aisi chijen pai jaati hai jinhen ve dehali kii lut se laayaa hua1 batalaate hai
 There is also a proverb in the Jats called 'loot of Delhivare'
 dehali kii chadhaai se laut aane ke peeche unhone apare aantarik shatruon ke daman karne kii atyant aavashyaktaa samajhi
 He also suspected that his army chief was involved in Malharrao Holkar's conspiracy
 unke paas samaru naam kaa prasiddh general aa chukaa tha
 Maharaj prepared a good army under his chairmanship
 kuch samay ke pashchaat vah agre gaye or balram tathaa duusare logon ko giraftaar kara liya
 Balarama and a second chieftain committed suicide for fear of insulting them
 maharaj jawaharsingh chaahate the ki in logon ke paas beyimaani purvak ikattha kiya hua dhan he, vah unhen praapt ho jaae
 It was said that Mohanrai Sardar had Rs 80 lakh in cash except personal property
 lekin mrityu paryant in saradaaron ne jawaharsingh ko kuch nahin bataaya
 Maharaja Jawahar Singh gave a lot of pain to those who had doubts about having any money
 itnaa karne par bhi maharaj jawaharsingh ko jitani aashaa thi, utana dhan praapt na hua, kyonki ve log jinhen puure dhan kaa pataa tha, duraagrah-purvak pataa batalaane se mar janaa uchit samajhe hue the
 After this, Bahadur Singh also had a power in opposition to Jawahar Singh, who also received a lot of rewards through the services of Maharaj Suraj Mal
 yah jawaharsingh kaa chachera bhai tha or vair kaa Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, p
 652 swami tha
 Along with a lot of money it also kept a good army
 maharaj surajmal kii mrityu ke baad bahadursingh ko abhimaan ho gaya tha
 He considered the right to establish and rule over the Jat-state as much as Jawahar Singh
 uske tatkaaleen vyavhaaron dwaara prakat hota tha ki vah ber ke maidani kshetra par swatantra shaasha banakar rahanaa chahta tha
 He did not stop even after Jawahar Singh stopped
 usne kilebandi kerani shuru kii
 Jawahar Singh ascended the war in August 1765 and surrounded the enclosure
 bahadursingh ne pehle se hi badi taiyaari kar lee thi, isliye usne datakar saamana kiya
 For three months, there were similar attacks and Bahadur Singh kept on wasting
 aakhirkaar vah chaalaaki se giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Bahadur Singh was imprisoned by Jawahar Singh and brought to Bharatpur and was released in November 1765
 idhar maharaj jawaharsingh bahadursingh ke daman main lage the or udhar naharsingh jawaharsingh kaa chota bhai dhaulpur rahete hue bharatpur par adhikaar kar lene kii cheshtaa main tha
 He knew very well that Jawahar Singh would deal with Bahadur Singh and turn you around
 sanyog se malharav holkar bhi sameep ke hi ek jat sardaar kii taak main phir rahaa tha
 Nahar Singh began to read and write to Bharatpur to get him empowered
 malharav dehali kii chadhaai ke baad se jawaharsingh se anth hi gaya tha or jab usne holkar par vishwasghaat kaa aparaadh laga kar tehre hue shesh 22 lakh rupee dene se inkaar kar diya to vah or bhi kudh gaya tha
 He understood this opportunity to take his oath and accepted Nahar Singh's help with great pleasure
 usne use dharmaputra banaaya or putr kii raksha ke naate se apni sena chambal bhej di, jo naharsingh kii sena se milakar dhaulpur-durg kii raksha karne lagi
 Jawahar Singh was also not sitting quietly in this period
 uske paas kul samachar pahunchate rahete the or vah is budhimaani se akraman karne kii taiyaari main tha ki naharsingh ke sahaayak maraathon kaa bhi raste main hi maan-mardan kar sake
 Maharaja Jawahar Singh soon saw the opportunity and left with his Punjabi soldiers and reached the banks of Chambal in December 1765
 yahaan maratha sena kaa ek hissaa, jo ki jat-pradesh main ghus aayaa tha, giraftaar kar liya gaya
 When Maharaja Jawahar Singh attacked Dholpur, the army of Nahar Singh and Marathas could not take iron from him and vijay-sri supported Maharaj Jawahar Singh
 dhaulpur par adhikaar karke vahaan ke bahut se maraathon Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, p
 653 ko unhone kaid kar liya
 Nahar Singh escaped from there and rested in a small Rajput jagirdar fort in Dholpur
 vahiin usne vish khaakar aatm-hatya kar lee or uskaa parivaar raja jaipur ke yahaan jaakar rahane laga
 Jawahar Singh Maharaj was not as humble as Surajmal
 vah avasar paakar shatru ko nasht kar dene kii taak main rahata tha
 Because of this same policy, he was not even on his side, the governor of his army
 maharaj jawaharsingh ne dhaulpur par adhikaar ho jane par dekha ki maraathon kii shakti itani hi he to vah unhen raajaputaane se nikaal bhagane kii ichha karne laga
 But as summer approached, his Sikh soldiers declined
 atah us samay usne apana iraadaa sthagit kar diya
 But Maharaja Jawahar Singh's motives were not just intentions
 us samay kii badhati hui shakti main sikh sainik uski adhyakshata main rahete the
 Therefore, he was in the idea of completing and firming the foundation of Surajmal's Jat-kingdom in all of northern India
 abdali ke mukaable main date rahane ke liye sikh kaaphi the or idhar vah maraathon ke liye tarkiben soch rahaa tha
 He was preparing to treat the Marathas by mixing the Jats of Malwa with the Jats
 gohad kaa rana chhatrasaal atyant veerta or bahaduree se maraathon se yuddh kar rahaa tha
 Like the Jats of Punjab and Bharatpur, the Jats there also showed their free thought and great courage
 maraathon kii vishaal sena ke saamne bhi varshon tak apane swatantra vichaar or dhyey ko kaayam rakhaa
 Maharaja Jawahar Singh, with the help of Veerwar Rana Chhatrashal, was determined to weaken the power of the Marathas
 jab madhorav peshwa ko is jabardast jat-sangh kaa pataa chalaa to use bada bhay hua
 Because he knew that its root is very strong and that is Jawahar Singh, due to which Maratha escaped from Dholpur a few days ago and whose news he had known
 usne 1766 basant ritu main raghunatharav ko holkar ke saath 60 hajaar ghudsavaar or ek sau badi topon ke saath maraathon kaa dabadabaa jamaane ke liye bheja tha
 Raghunathrao already laid siege to Gohad and offered very strong demands
 jawaharsingh is samay bahut biimaar tha, parantu sheeghra hi swasthya laabh lene par maraathon se yuddh karne pahunch gaya
 But the misfortune which has caused our country to suffer so many disasters, and the country has reached this anxiety-plight, the same misfortune also stagnated there
 maharaj ke dal main do dusht jayachand khadey ho gaye
 They greed a little jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-654 But Maharaj promised to imprison Jawahar Singh in his camp
 foot jane vaale vishwasghaatee anupgiri gosai ke bhed kii soochna guptcharon dwaara maharaj ko thik samay par lagi
 He prepared his army at midnight and immediately attacked the camp of the Gosai
 dusht vishwasghaatee badi kathinata se bhagkar praan bachaa paae, parantu uske saathi ek badi sankhya main kaid kar liye gaye
 Looted their camp
 jisamen 1400 ke kareeb ghode, 10 hathi, 100 topein va anya or bhi kitna hi saamaan maharaj ke haath aayaa
 Thus they got the fruits of their actions
 isi samay abdali ne phir pair badhaayaa or maraathon kii tarah vah bhi bharat main punah rob-daub baitaane punjab main upasthit hua
 Jawahar Singh and Raghunathrao had a treaty to confront Abdali — in a way they decided to quarrel
 aapas main tay paaya ki-1
 jo kaidi bharatpur main hai chhod die jaaen, 2
 yadi ki marathe duusari sandhi kii sharton ko puraa kar den to jawaharsingh malharrav ke tay kiye hue bakaayaa rupee de degaa, 3
 raghunatharav, maharaj jawaharsingh ke rajya ke aas-paas kaa raajaputaane kaa hissaa raja ko 5, xxrep 5 0 rupaya salaana lagaan par de den
 Thus, these conditions were not fulfilled from both the sides and neither was there any desire to fulfill them, if any saw would have seen the benefit of breaking it
 san 1767 ke madhya tak sikhon ke jor pakad jane se abdali kaa bhay na rahaa
 At that time, Jawahar Singh did not sit quietly
 usne varsha ritu main hi yuddh ke liye kadam badhaayaa
 Ater and Bhind where the kings of the Marathas were under the rule of Maharaja Jawahar Singh first went towards them
 vah us ore bahut bad gaya, jitna ki usne swayan na sochaa tha
 With his powerful army, he took Marathas and other small vassals up to Kalpi in his possession
 is tarah jat-rajya kii seemaa usne bahut kuch badha di
 At this time a power in India was gaining more legs and that was the British
 parantu angrej bhi kisi aise mitra kii khoj main the jo unki madad kar sake
 The clever British sent a letter to Maharaja Jawahar Singh on 19 August 1765, in which it was written that if the Maharaja removes the French named Samru from his place, the British will help Bharatpur against external invasion
 parantu maharaj ne is patr par kinchit bhi dhyaan na diya
 Even Maharaj completely forgot about it
 lekin angrej maharaj jawaharsingh se sandhi karne ke liye vyagr ho rahe the
 They were trying it again and again
 jawaharsingh ne dekha ki sandhi ke liye marathe jab swayan prarthana kar rahe hai to unase to sandhi ke Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, p
 655 liye darkhwaast kii gai he, vah sheeghra hi abdali ke viruddh angrejon main ja mila
 He was attracted towards the British due to the sincere terms of the treaty
 jawaharsingh ne bhi apni mitrataa ko puri tarah nibhaayaa
 He did not have any relation with Abdali when he was befriended by the British and even after his prayers, he remained firm in his determination and position
 isi tarah maraathon se angrejon ke kaaran mitrataa tod di
 Maharaj Jawahar Singh, whenever he had the opportunity, hit hands with the Marathas and because of their indifference, he occupied many of the Maratha occupied territories
 dehali ke aas-paas or meerut ke jaaton ne jab suna ki jat naresh jawaharsingh dehali par chadhaai karne ko aayaa he, to ve lathi, ballam jo bhi haath laga, lekar sena main aa mili
 Similarly, Braj's Jats also joined him
 jab unhone malwe par chadhaai kii to vahaan ke jaaton kaa haal or prem bhi vah dekh chuke the
 Now he wished to see the Jats on the west side of Rajputana
 unka rajya teen ore to bad chukaa tha, ab yah chauthi disha baaki thi jis par ki unhone ab tak dhyaan na diya tha
 Raja Pratapsingh, the founder of the kingdom of Alwar, encouraged Jawahar Singh to move further
 usne samarthan hi nahin, balki inase prarthana kii, kyonki vah jaipur-naresh se jhagada karke maharaj surajmal ke sangrakshan main aayaa tha
 Therefore, he wanted the state which had done injustice to it to avenge it
 vastav main bharatpur or jaipur ke virodh kaa kaaran bhi adhiktar yahi tha
 But later on due to this betrayal, Maharaja Jawahar Singh had to suffer loss
 is haani kaa fal bhi jawaharsingh ke liye bahut bura hua
 The Maharaja betrayed what he did well
 thik hi he - “payah paanan bhujanganaan kevalan vishavardhanam
 " bharatendu jawaharsingh ne pushkar snaan ke uddeshy se senasahit yatra shuru kii
 Pratapsingh was also with Maharaj
 jat-sainikon ke haath main basanti jhande fahraa rahe the
 Hearing the news of the journey of these Jatavirs of the King of Jaipur, they stood up
 vah ghabadaa-sa gaya
 Although Jawahar Singh did not go with such an intention at this time, but the royal way of travel
 jaipur naresh yaa kisi anya ne unke saath koi ched-chhaad nahi kii or vah gaaje-baaje ke saath nishchit sthaan par pahunch gaye
 Even after bathing and meditating, Maharaj stayed there for a few days
 raja vijaisingh se unki mitrataa hui
 As soon as Maharaj left, there was a storm in the Rajput feudatories
 udhar ke shasit jat or is shaasha jat raja ko ve ek drushti se dekhne Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, p
 656 lage
 As soon as this petty idea was born, the balance of the feudalities deteriorated and the flock reached Jaipur King and started provoking them
 parantu jat sainikon se jinhen ki unhone jate dekh liya tha, unki veerta or adhik taadaat ko dekhakar, aamane-saamne kaa yuddh karne kii inaki himmat na padati thi
 Jawahar Singh was fond of his brave community, the only purpose of his visit was not only to pushkar-snan, but also to see the condition of Jat-people there
 unako maaloom hua ki tauravati main adhik sankhya jat nivas karte hai to udhar waapas lautne kaa nishchay kiya
 The Rajputs had made full preparations to attack them on their return
 yahaan tak ki jo niraashrith pratapsingh bhagkar bharatpur raaj kii sharan main gaya tha or unhone aashray hi nahin, kai varsh tak apane yahaan sakushal or surakshit rakhaa tha, shadyantr main shaamil ho gaya
 He gave all the secret of Maharaj's strength
 rajput tang raste, naale vagairah main maharaj jawaharsingh ke pahunchane kii pratiksha karte rahe
 He was seeing such an opportunity that Jat Veer separated from each other and appeared in two to three parts only then he could be attacked
 taarikh 14 disambar 1767 ko maharaj jawaharsingh ek tang raste or naale main se nikle
 By nature, very few soldiers can move together at such a place
 aisi haalat main vaise hi jat ek lambi qatari main ja rahe the
 The baggage had already passed two or three miles
 aamane-saamne ke dar se yuddh na karne vaale rajputon ne isi samay dhaava bol diya
 Faith-deadly Pratapsingh had already left Maharaja Jawahar Singh and left
 ghamaasan yuddh hua
 The Jat Veers gave up their attachment to life and broke up on the enemies in the battlefield
 jaipur naresh ne bhi apmaan se krodh main bharkar rajput saradaaron ko ekatrit kiya
 All, except the 10-year-old boy of the Jagirdar Rajputs of Jaipur, had joined this war
 sab sardaar chhin-bhinn raste jate hue jat-sainikon par pil pade
 The Jat soldiers also surrounded and accepted this call of war and started a fierce battle
 akramanakariyon kii paidal sena or topakhana bahut kam raftaar se chalate the
 The Jat soldiers took advantage of this and entered the valley
 kareeb madhyanh ke donon senaayen acchhee tarah bhidin
 At this time, the forces of Madik and Samru fought with great valor and cleverness on behalf of Maharaja Jawahar Singh
 jat-sainikon ne jaipur ke raja ko parrast kiya
 But due to the fact that the army was organized and operated on behalf of the Jats and not present in the battle-field, Maharaj Jawahar Singh did not succeed in this fight
 lekin vah swayan sadaa kii bhaanti asaadhaaran veerta or josh ke saath andhera hone tak yuddh karte rahe
 Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, p
 657 jaipur sena kaa pradhan senapati dalelsinh, apni teen pidiyon ke saath maaraa gaya
 Although Maharaj did not get victory in this war and had to suffer a lot of loss, but at the same time there was no less loss of enemy
 kehete hai yuddh main aae hue kareeb kareeb samast jagirdaar kaam aaye or unke peeche jo 8-10 saal ke balak batch rahe the, ve vansh chalaane ke liye shesh rahe the
 There is no doubt that Maharaja Jawahar Singh also came to know about the situation and attitude of the Jats that his self-respect was dead due to being ruled for a long time
 nahin to kya kaaran tha ki jab vah dehali kii or chadhaai karne gaya tha to you
pi
 or meerut ke jat prayek ghar se lathi kandhe par rakhkar usase aa mili or maharaj par idhar akraman hone par bhi unke kaanon par jun bhi na rengi
 The visit of Maharaj Jawahar Singh was not auspicious
 ab unka madhyahn surya dhalaa
 The only rule of a changing world is that there is not always a single attack here
 is mahatvakankshi jat sardaar ko bhi parivartan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 When his enemies heard that Jawahar Singh had suffered from the Jaipur war, he saw that now is the chance
 yah samachar sunate hi chambal paar kaa pradesh vidrohi ban gaya or jis shighrata se vah jat-rajya main mila tha, usee tarah nikal bhi gaya
 Here, the courage of Madhousinh was also increased and due to heavy loss, he entered the Jat-kingdom with 60 thousand army to take revenge
 farrukhanagar kaa nawab musabikhan baloch or ruhele rajputon kii sahaayta karne ko tatpar ho gaye
 It is rightly said, like 'durdin dade Rahim Kahi, Bhoolat Sab Pehichan', the Sikhs took off on leaving the Maharaja's friendship and started leaving his two outlying provinces
 madhusingh ne aage badhane or agre ke durg ko musabikhan kii sena se milakar jeetne ke liye shahi hukmanama bheja
 At this time everyone was advising Maharaja Jawahar Singh to reconcile with the Rajputs, but the self-respecting jat-sardar preferred to settle the glorious settlement by fighting the war
 vah yuddh ke liye tatparta se taiyaari karne laga
 He gave 7 lakh rupees to the Sikhs in exchange for the greed of plunder
 em
 medic kaa bhatta sena badhaane ke liye 5000 rupee mahavar badha diya
 When the Rajputs got scared
 ve soch rahe the jawaharsingh swayan sandhi kaa prastaav karegaa, parantu ab unhone dekha ki sikhon ko usne apni ore kar liya he, to ve ghabara gaye
 All their intentions had to be bribed and taken away
 jat-rajya se sakushal nikal janaa unhen asambhav maaloom hua
 With the fear of incoming fear, he made a treaty with Maharaj Jawahar Singh, one of his defenses jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-658 Thought only solution
 jat-naresh se sandhi-prarthana kar sandhi kar lee gai or vah shighrata se apane sthaan par laut gaye
 In this way the Rajputs reached their country even before the terrible horsemen of Punjab arrived
 jab se jawaharsingh raajaputaane se lautaa tha, tab se vah shant na baitha tha
 His enemies had forgotten that he had become courageous, although at that time he had to suffer a lot due to his enemies standing upright, but he did not become unstable
 uskaa swabhaav hi allahadpan kii veerta se ot-prot tha
 He did not even know what fear is called
 ladaai karne kii ichha uski rag-rag main bhari thi
 Life was dull for him without a fight
 madhusingh ke chale jane par jab usne dekha ki yah aayaa hua yuddh rupi khel khilne kaa avasar nikal gaya to medic ke saath ek kile ko jahaan rajputon kaa ek doosraa vansh rajya karata tha, adhikaar main karne kii taiyaari kar kooch kar di
 After a month and a half, he was able to climb the fort
 uski sena jab kile ke gole-barood se bhaybheet ho gai to bhi yah nidar bhav se data rahaa
 The second time he went from under the drawer of the fort and the fortress guards became afraid
 maharaj jawaharsingh is tarah drudhchitt or adamya utsaah se phir sambhal baitha tha, jise jaanakar shatruon ko bhay hone laga tha
 Very quickly, Maharaj again made the situation deteriorated
 uske hathiyaar pehle kii bhaanti chamakane lage or rajya dhan-dhaany se samrudh hone laga jisase praja kaa prem bhi praapt ho gaya
 He organized his army in a European manner, increased artillery so that the outsiders started to honor him
 uske shatruon ko bada bhay hua ki kahin uske krodh kaa jwalamukhi phir se na ubal pade
 But unfortunately, it was something else that caused the lamp of ghee to burn in the house of his enemies
 june san 1768 main jawaharsingh kisi ghaatak dhokhe se maar daale gayi
 In the 'brajendra-vansha Bhaskar', the name of that deadly is written Sujat Meo
 ‘imaad’ kaa lekhak likhata he ki maharaj jabarsingh ne keval ajaan dene par ek manushya kii jihva nikalava lee thi
 Agra's mosque was marketed and grain shops were opened in it
 koi bhi kasaai maance nahin bech saktaa tha
 It is likely that a Tasubi Muslim may have attacked and killed him
 maharaj jawaharsingh kii mrityu ke liye itnaa hi kahana paryaapt hoga ki jaaton kaa sitara, hindu-dharm kaa rakshak, jisaki abhi baari aavashkata thi, asamay main hi vilupt ho gaya
 The car of the Jat-empire stopped due to his death jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-659 But at the same time Hindu interests were also hurt
 1 He had seen that on every occasion, Iranians, Turani Muslims and Biloch living in India supported the outside invaders, engaged in a plan to re-enslave the country to Afghans, by issuing some Sufi saint fatwas here, Abdali Were supporting atah unako is varg se ghrinaa ho gai thi
 When Maharaja Surajmal was killed by deceit near Shahdara, the Empress Kishori told Maharaja Jawahar Singh in a single taunt saying "you walk around wearing a turban, your father's turban is turned upside down in the shawras of Shahdara", preparing for war
 gave 
 maharaja jawaharsingh hi pehle hindu naresh the jinhone agre ke kile or dilli ke laal kile ko jitkar vijay vaijayanti fahraai thi 
 In the battle of Red Fort in Delhi, when the fort could not be conquered in any way
 jawahar singh ki dilli vijay main paakharia kaa yogadan atulyaneey he
 When the Jat army reached Delhi and it was necessary to break the lock of the gate of the Red Fort to conquer Delhi so that the army could enter the fort
 par jab laal kile ke phatak ko todane ke liye kesaria naam ke hathi ne 12 takkar maari, par phatak nahin tut paaya
 Each time the elephant was injured by piercing a banana on the head of the elephant
 yah dekh maharaj jawahar singh bole kila mushkil se tuutegaa
 The war will end in half

 That is when Pushkar Singh came forward to show bravery
