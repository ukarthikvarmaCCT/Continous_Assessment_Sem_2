 Muslims believe that it was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad
 musalmaan maanate hai ki koran hi allaah kii bheji antim or sarvocch kitaab he
 This book originated about 1400 years ago
 islam kii manyataon ke mutabiq koran allaah ke farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko san 610 se san 632 main unki maut tak kulasa kiya gaya tha
 Although initially spread orally, it was first written in 633 after the death of Prophet Muhammad, and in 653 it was standardized and distributed to the Islamic Empire
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki ishwar dwaara bheje gaye pavitra sandeshon ke sabase aakiri sandesh koran main likhe gaye hai
 These messages originated with Adam
 hazarat aadam islamic manyataon main sabase pehla nabi tha or isaki tulana hindu dharm ke manu se ek had tak kii ja sakati he
 Just as the children of Manu have been called human in Hinduism, similarly the children of Adam in Islam are called man

 In his time, the Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years, the mark of this civilization on the whole world gives its mark
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 According to Muslims, the knowledge given in the Quran proves that Hazrat Muhammad is an Islamic prophet
 "koran" shabd kaa pehla zikr khud koran main hi miltaa he jahaan iskaa arth he - usne padhaa, yaa usne uchaara
 The word takes its Syrian parallel Kuriana meaning reading texts
 hanlanki paashchaatya jaankaar isko syrian shabd se jodate hai, adhikansh musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mul kura shabd hi he
 But whatever it was at the time of Hazrat Muhammad's birthday it became an Arabic word
 khud koran main is shabd kaa koi 70 baar zikr hua he
 Apart from this, the Qur'an also has many names
 ise al furqaan, al hikmah, dhikr / zikr or mashhaf jaise naamon se bhi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 In the Qur'an, Allah has mentioned 25 Ambiya
 quran shabd quran main lagbhag 70 baar prakat hota he, jo vibhinn arthon ko maanata he
 It is a verbal noun of the Arabic verb qara, meaning "he reads"
 siriek samatuly qarayana he, jo "shaastra padhane" yaa "sabak" ko sanderbhit karata he
 While some Western scholars consider the term to be derived from the Syriac, a majority of Muslim officials consider the word to have originated
 bhale hi, yah mohammad ke jeevankaal main arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 An important meaning of the word is "the work of the text", as indicated in the early Qur'anic passage: "it is for us to gather it and read it
 anya chhandon main, shabd "ek vyaktigat maarg " ko sanderbhit karata he
 This is done in many ways in many contexts
 udhaaharan ke taur par: "jab al-quran padhaa jaataa he, to ise sunen or chup rahen
 "can also assume the meanings described with texts from other religions such as the Torah and the Gospel
 is shabd main samanaarthi samanaarthi shabd bhi hai jo puure quran main niojit hai
 Each synonym has its own different meaning, but its use can be found with the Quran in some contexts
 is tarah ke shabdon main kitaab, aayah ; or sura shaamil hai
 The latter two terms also denote units of publication
 sandarbhon ke bade bahumat main, aamtaur par ek nishchit lekh ke saath, shabd ko "prakaashan" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jise antaraal par "bheja gaya" diya gaya he
 Other related words are: dhikr, referring to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and hikmah, sometimes referring to revelation or part of it
 quran khud ko "samajhadaari", "grantho kii maan", "guide", "gyaan", "yaad" ke rup main varnit karata he
 And "revelation"
 ek or shabd al-kitaab he, haalanki yah anya shastron, jaise torah or bible ke liye arabi bhashaa main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term Mushaf is often used to refer to particular Quranic scripts but is also used to identify earlier books in the Quran
 islamic parampara se sambandhit he ki mohammad ne pahaado par hira kii gupha main apni ibaadat ke dauraan apana pehla prakaashan praapt kiya tha
 Subsequently, he received the revelation of the complete Qur'an over a period of 23 years
 haddees or muslim itihaas ke mutabik, mohammad madina main aakar ek swatantra muslim samudaay kaa gathan karne ke baad, unhone apane kai saathi quran ko padhane or kanoonon ko seekhney or sikhaane kaa aadesh diya, jinhen dainik bataaya gaya tha
 It is related that some Quraysh who were taken as prisoners in the Battle of Badr regained their independence after having taught some Muslims the simple writings of the time
 is prakaar musalamaanon kaa ek samooh dhire-dhire sakshar ban gaya
 As it was said initially, the Quran was recorded on planks, skins, bones, and wooden stems
 musalamaanon ke bich zyaadaatar sure upyog main the kyonki sunni or shiya donon sroton dwaara kai hadison or itihaas main unka ullekh kiya gaya he, mohammad ke islam ke aahvaan ke rup main quran ke upyog se sambandhit, prarthana karne or padhane ke tareeke ke rup main
 However, the Quran was not present in book form in 632 at the time of Muhammad's death
 vidwaanon ke bich ek samjhauta he ki mohammad ne khud ko rahasyodghatan nahin likhaa tha
 Sahih al-bukhari narrates the revelation to Muhammad in the hadith, "sometimes it is like ringing a bell" and Aisha said, "I saw the Prophet being inspired by him on a very cold day and with his forehead
 Was sweating
 jaise hi vahi kii prerana khatm ho jaati to unki bechaini dur hojaati
 "muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was with a vision
 prakaashan ke madhyam "ek shaktishaalee" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, vah vyakti jo "sabase upar kshitij par tha jab dekhne ke liye spasht hua
 Then he came close and started talking to Muhammad
 " islamic adhyayan vidwaan velch vishwakosh main bataate hai ki unka maananaa he ki in kshanon par mohammad kii haalat or vivaranon ko vaastavik mana ja saktaa he, kyonki in rahasyodghatano ke baad unhen gambhir rup se pareshaan kiya gaya tha
 According to Welch, people around him must have witnessed these visits to the superhuman origins of Muhammad's inspirations
 haalanki, mohammad ke aalochakon ne unhen ek vyakti, ek kavi yaa jaadugar hone kaa aarope lagaaya kyonki unke anubhav pracheen arab main aise aankadon dwaara daawa kiye gaye logon ke samaan the
 Welch additionally states that it is uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial prophetic claim
 quran mohammad ko "ummi" ke rup main varnit karata he, jise paramparaagat rup se "ashikshit" ke rup main vyakhya kiya jaataa he, lekin iskaa arth adhik jatil he
 Medieval commentators such as al-tabri stated that the word inspired two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; Second, inexperience or ignorance of previous books or texts
 mohammad kii nirakshartaa ko unki bhavishyavaanee kii vaastaviktaa ke sanket ke rup main liya gaya tha
 For example, according to Fakhruddin al-razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading, he might have been suspected of studying the books of the ancients
 wat jaise kuch vidwaan "ummi" kaa doosraa arth pasand karte hai - ve ise pehle pavitra granthon ke saath aparichitata ko ingit karne ke liye lete hai
 The last verse of the Quran was revealed in the year 10th Hijri on the 18th of the Islamic month of Dhu al-hijjah, a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632
 paigambar ne gadir e khumm main apana upadesh dene ke baad yah khulaasa kiya tha
 After Muhammad's death in 632, many of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in the Battle of Yamama by Musalima
 pehle khalipha, abu bakr, baad main pustak ko ek granth main ikattha karne kaa faisla kiya taaki ise sangrakshit kiya ja sake
 Zaid ibn Thabit was the first to collect the Quran as he wrote the verses and suras read from Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah
 is prakaar, shastreey samooh, sabase mahatvapurn zayd bin thabit ne chand ekatra kiye or puri kitaab kaa sankalan karke kuran ko kitaab kaa rup diya tha
 In this way, the Quran came in the form of a book and it was with Abu Bakr
 is kaary ke liye zayd ne un tamaam panne jinhen haddi par, patton par, pattharon par likhaa gaya tha or kai log kanthst bhi kiye the un sab kaa krodikaran kiya
 After Abu Bakr, Muhammad's widow Hafsa Bint Umar was assigned to this manuscript in about 650
 tisare khalif uthman ebn afaan ne quran ke uccharan main maamuli matbhedon ko dhyaan main rakhana shuru kiya kyonki islam arab prayadweep se pare faras, levent or uttari africa main failaa tha
 To preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use the copy of Abu Bakr and produce a standard copy of the Quran
 is prakaar, mohammad kii mrityu ke 20 varshon ke bheetar, quran likhit rup main patibaddh tha
 The text became the model from which copies were made and projected in urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed
 quran paath kaa vartmaan rup muslim vidwaanon dwaara abu bakar dwaara sankalit mul sanskaran mana jaataa he
 According to Shia, Ali ibn Abi Talib compiled a complete version of the Quran soon after Muhammad's death
 is paath kaa kram uthman ke yug ke dauraan baad main ikattha hua tha ki is sanskaran ko kalkram kram main ekatrit kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, he made no objection against the standardized Quran and accepted the Quran into circulation
 quran kii anya vyaktigat pratiyaan ebn masood or ube ebn kaab ke kodex samet maujuud ho sakati hai, jinamein se koi bhi aaj maujuud nahin he
 The Quran is most likely written in scattered form during Muhammad's lifetime
 kai strot bataate hai ki mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan badi sankhya main unke saathi ne khulaasa yaad kiya tha
 Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above understanding of the early development of the Quran
 quran apane vartmaan rup main academik vidwaanon dwaara mohammad dwaara boli jane vaale shabdon ko record karne ke liye aam taur par mana jaataa he kyonki verient kii khoj ne bahut mahatv nahin diya he
 Professor Fred Donner of the University of Chicago stated that "


 there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonant text of the Quran, possibly a broader and more diverse set of related texts in transmission
 is manakikrut cannical paath ke nirmaan ke baad, pehle aadhikarik granthon ko dabaa diya gaya tha, or sabhi maujuuda pandulipiyon - unke kai roopon ke baavjood-is maanak vyanjan paath kii sthapana ke baad ek samay kii taarikh lagati he
 "although most version readings of the Quranic text have ceased to be broadcast, some are still
 vahaan koi mahatvapurn paath nahin hua he jis par kuranik paath kaa vidwaan punarnirmaan aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Historically, controversy over the content of the Quran has rarely become an issue, although debate on the subject continues
 1972 main, sanaa, yaman shahar main ek masjid main, pandulipiyon kii khoj kii gai thi jo baad main us samay maujuud sabase pracheen kuranik paath sabit hue the
 Sana's manuscripts have a page from which the parchment has been washed to make it reusable — a practice that was common in ancient times due to the lack of writing materials
 haalanki, behosh dhoyaa hua antarnihit paath abhi bhi mushkil se dikhaai detaa he or ise "purv-uthamanik" kuranik saamagree mana jaataa he, jabaki sheersh par likhe gaye paath ko uthamanik samay mana jaataa he
 Studies using radiocarbon dating show that parchments date back to the period prior to 671 CE with a 99 percent probability
 2015 main, 1370 saal pehle dating karne vaale bahut hi shuruaati quran ke tukade england ke birmingham vishvavidhyalay kii pustkaalay main khoje gaye the
 According to tests conducted by the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, "the parchment ranged between 568 and 645, with a probability of over 95%"
 pandulipi lija arabi ke praarambhik rup hijaaji lipi main likhi gai he
 This is possibly the oldest example of the Quran, but an extended date of trials is allowed, so it cannot be said with certainty which of the current versions is the oldest
 saudi vidwaan saud al-sirhaan ne tukdon kii umr main andeh vyakt kiya he kyonki unamem dots or adhyay vibhaajak shaamil hai jinhen mana jaataa he ki baad main iskaa janm hua tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran has become a book of divine guidance from God to Muhammad through Allah through Jibril and sees the Quran as God's final revelation to humanity
 islamic or kuranik sandarbhon main prakashitvaakya kaa matlab he ki ishwar kaa kaary kisi vyakti ko sambodhit karnaa, praptakartaaon kii ek badi sankhya ke liye sandesh bhejnaa
 The process through which a divine message comes to the heart of the Messenger of God is sordid or nazul
 jaisaa ki quran kahata he, "sachai ke saath hamane ise neeche bhej diya he or sachai ke saath yah neeche aa gaya he
 " quran aksar apane paath main jor detaa he ki ise ishwariya rup se niyukt kiya jaataa he
 Some verses in the Quran indicate that even Arabic-speaking people will understand the Quran if they are recited
 quran ek likhit purv-paath, "sangrakshit tablet" ko sanderbhit karata he, jo ise bhejne se pehle bhi bhagwaan ke bhaashan ko record karata he
 The issue that the Quran is eternal or created became a religious debate in the ninth century
 tark or tarksangat vichaaron ke aadhaar par dharamshastra ke ek islamic skool mutajilas ne kaha ki quran banaaya gaya tha, jabaki muslim dharmavidon kii sabase vyapak kismein quran ko ishwar ke saath sah-shaashvat maanate the or isliye akushal the
 Sufi philosophers frame this question as artificial or incorrect
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa vartmaan shabd mohammad ko pataa chalaa he, or quran 15: 9 kii unki vyakhya ke anusaar, yah bhrashtachar se sangrakshit he 
 Muslims consider the Quran a guide, a sign of Muhammad's prophecy and the truth of religion
 quran kaa anokhaapan yah vishwaas he ki quran se kisi maanviya boli yaa koi saamagree se tulana nahin ho sakati
 The Quran is considered by Muslims to be an incomparable miracle, effective until the day of Yaum al-qiyama, and thus, providing central evidence to Muhammad in the certification of his prophetic status
 quran main aprihaaryta kii avadharana utpann hoti he, jahaan paanch alag-alag chhandon main virodhiyon ko quran kii tarah kuch utpann karne ke liye chunauti di jaati he: "yadi maanav or jinn is quran kii tarah vaani paidaa karne ke liye ek saath bandha bhi jaaen to ve kabhi bhi aisa nahin kar paayenge, yadi vah aapas main kitna bhi samarthan karke dekh len
 "so the suggestion is that if there are doubts related to the divine authorship of the Quran, then come forward and create something like that
 nauveen shatabdi se, kai log or kaam dikhaai die jo quran kaa adhyayan karte the or isaki style or saamagree kii jaanch karte the
 Medieval Muslim scholars, including al-jurjani and al-baqillani, have written several texts on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran
 anya log tark dete hai ki quran main mahaan vichaar hai, aantarik arth hai, umr ke madhyam se apni taazgi banaae rakhte hai
 And through the Quran there have been major changes on a personal level and in history
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki quran main vaigyanik jaankaree he jo aadhunik vigyaan se sahamat he
 The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran emphasizes the illiteracy of Muhammad because of how the unknown prophet would have the ability to write the Quran
 is liye yah ishwar vaani he
 The first sura of the Quran is read and repeated in Sura e Fatiha daily prayers and other occasions
 yah sura, jisamen saat chand hote hai, quran kaa sabase adhik baar padhaa jane vaala sura he: Let me start in the name of God, who is very kind to me
 All praise is for the sake of God, who is God and master; And the one who carries all the living is a great kindness; Rosé is the master of Jaza; God we pray to you and seek help from you; So, keep us on the straight path; Their path, which you have not accepted, nor their path, on which you have been thrashed and misguided
 " Other sections of the Quran are also recited in daily prayers
 quran ke likhit paath kaa sammaan kai musalamaanon dwaara dharmik vishwaas kaa ek mahatvapurn tatv he, or quran ko sammaan ke saath mana jaataa he
 56:79 Based on tradition and a literal interpretation of the Quran, some Muslims believe that they must wazoo before touching a copy of the Quran, although this idea is not universal

 vah likhte hai: "quran saboot ke bina anumaan lagane ke khatre par dhyaan khinchataa he gyaan nahin kiya he 


 17:36) or kai alag-alag chhandon main musalamaanon se poochta he pramaanon kii aavashyaktaa ke liye, to saboot kii aavashyaktaa he, donon dharmik vishwaas or prakritik vigyaan main

 Ziauddin Sardar made a case for Muslims to develop the foundations of modern science in order to pay attention and reflect on the natural phenomena that the Quran repeatedly calls for
 bhautik vigyaani abdus salaam ne apane nobel puraskaar bhoj pate main quran kii ek prasiddh kavita uddhrut kii or phir kaha: "yah prabhaav sabhi bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he: jitna gaharaa ham chaahate hai, utana hi adhik hamaare aashcharya utsahit, hamaare nazar kaa chamak he "
 One of Salam's core beliefs was that there is no contradiction between Islam and discoveries that science tells humanity about nature and the universe
 salaam ne yah bhi raay rakhi ki quran or adhyayan or tarksangat pratibimb kii islamic bhaavana asaadhaaran sabhyataa ke vikaas kaa strot thi
 Salaam, in particular, used Ibn al-haytham and al-biruni as pioneers of the empiricist who introduced the experimental approach, breaking with Aristotle's influence and thus giving rise to modern science

 The message of the Quran is conveyed with various literary structures and devices
 mul arabi main, surya or chand dhvanyatmak or vishaygat sanrachanaon ko niojit karte hai jo paath ke sandesh ko yaad karne ke liye darshakon ke prayaason main sahaayta karte hai
 Muslims insist that the content and style of the Quran are inappropriate
 quran kii bhashaa ko "kavita gadhy" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he kyonki yah kavita or gadhy donon kaa hissaa he; haalanki, yah vivaran kuranik bhashaa kii layaaddh gunvattta ko vyakt karne main vifal hone kaa jokhim chalaata he, jo kuch hisson main adhik kavy he or dusron main adhik gadhy jaisaa he
 The Quran, while found throughout the Quran, is typical of many earlier Mecca Suras, in which relatively few verses throw singing words into prominence
 is tarah ke rup kii prabhaavashiltaa udhaaharan ke liye sura 81 main spasht he, or isamen koi andeh nahin he ki in margon ne shrotaaon ke vivek ko prabhavit kiya
 a change of verse from one set of verses to another signal is often a change in the subject of discussion
 baad ke khand bhi is form ko sangrakshit karte hai lekin style adhik expogitary he
 The Quranic text has no beginning, middle or end, its nonlinear structure is similar to a web or net
 paathyacharya vyavastha ko kabhi-kabhi nirantarata kii kami, kisi bhi kalkram yaa vishaygat kram or doharaav kii anupasthiti ko pradarshit karne ke liye mana jaataa he

 Selling also addresses the recurrence of much discussion of the Quran, also seeing it as a literary device
 ek paath aatm-sanderbhit hota he jab yah swayan ke bare main bolta he or khud ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Stephen Wilde, the Quran illustrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted
 un anuchhedon main aatm- refrencielity spasht he jahaan quran swayan ko ek aatmanirbhar tareeke se, samachar, maandand ke rup main swayan ko prakat karne ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 There is a blessed remembrance that we sent down, so are you rejecting it now? "), Or in the frequent presence of the" say "tag, when Muhammad is ordered to speak
 junglee ke anusaar quran atyadhik aatm-sanderbhit he
 This feature is more pronounced in early Mecca Suras
 mukhya lekh: tafasir The Quran has sparked a vast body of commentary and interpretation intended to explain the meanings of Quranic verses, clarify their import, and unravel their significance
 tafaseer musalamaanon kii sabase shuruaati shaikshanik gatividhiyon main se ek he
 According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person to describe the meanings of verses for early Muslims
 anya shuruaati nikaayon main mohammad ke kuch saathi shaamil the, jaise ' ali ebn abi talib ,' abdulla ebn abbaas, abdulla ebn umr or ubey ebn kaab 
 In those days exegesis was limited to the literary aspects of the poem, the background of its publication and, sometimes, the explanation of the interpretation of one poem with the help of another
 yadi kavita ek aitihaasik ghatana ke bare main thi, to kabhi-kabhi mohammad kii kuch paramparaon ko iskaa arth spasht karne ke liye varnit kiya gaya tha
 Since the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic, many of the latter did not convert to Islam, they did not always understand Quranic Arabic, they did not catch Muslims who were fluent in Arabic of Muslims and were concerned with settling subjects in the Quran
 Clear struggle of
 arabi main tippanee karne vaale tippaneekaron ne sanketon ko samajhaayaa, or shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah samajhaayaa ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke karier main quran ke chhandon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya tha, jo ki sabase shuruaati muslim samudaay ke liye upyukt tha, or jise baad main prakat kiya gaya tha, radd karnaa yaa " nirast karnaa " nasakh ) pehle ke paath 
 However, other scholars say that there is no repeal in the Quran
 ahmadiya muslim samudaay ne quran par das khand vaali urdu tippanee prakashit kii he, jiskaa naam tafaseer i kabir he 
 The esoteric interpretation or Sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meaning of the Quran
 sufiwaad chhandon ke spasht bindu se aage badhata he or iske bajaay quran ke chand ko aantarik yaa gudh or chetana or astitv ke aadhyatmik ayaamon se sambandhit karata he
 According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are indicative rather than explanatory
 ve sambhaavnaaon ko ingit karte hai jitna ki ve prayek lekhak kii antardrushti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The Sufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keller, is also an example of the use of the subject of love, for example in the Qur'anic interpretation of the Quran
 quran 7: 143 kahata he: When Moses came at the time when we appointed, and his Allah spoke to him, he said, 'my Allah, show me yourself! let me see you!' He said, 'you won't see me, but look at that mountain, if it stays strong you will see me
 ' jab uske bhagwaan ne pahaad par khud ko prakat kiya, to usne ise kharaab kar diya
 Moses fainted
 jab vah thik ho gaya, usne kaha, 'jai ho! main tumse pashchaatap karata hoon! main vishwaas karne vaala pehla vyakti hum! In 7: 143 Moses, the way of those who are in love, comes asking for a vision but his will is denied, he is commanded to see other than the mountain, while the mountain is able to see God
 
 parvat par bhagwaan ke prakat hone kii drushti se parvat chur or musa behosh hojaate hai
 In the words of Kushayari, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and Moses of Moses had nothing left
 khud se unmoolan kii sthiti main, musa ko vaastaviktaaon kaa anaavaran diya gaya tha
 From a Sufi point of view, God always causes the will and suffering of the beloved and the wayfarer to realize the truth
 mohammad hossain taababatei kehete hai ki baad ke utthanon ke bich lokapriy spashtikaran ke anusaar, tavil kaa arth he ki ek kavita kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 The meaning of revelation, as opposed to Tawal, is clear according to the explicit meaning of the words, as they were told
 lekin yah spashtikaran itnaa vyapak ho gaya he ki, vartmaan main, yah tavil kaa praathmik arth ban gaya he, jiskaa mul rup se "vaapasi karne" yaa "vaapasi sthaan" kaa arth tha
 In Tabatai's view, what is called taiwil or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran is not concerned with the signification of words
 iske bajaay, yah kuch sachai or vaastaviktaaon se sambandhit he jo purushon ke saamaanya bhaag kii samaj se pare he; phir bhi yah in satyon or vaastaviktaaon se he ki siddhant ke siddhant or quran ke vyaavhaarik nishedh jari hai
 Interpretation is not the meaning of the poem but it is transparent in a particular type of transit through that meaning
 ek aadhyatmik vaastaviktaa he- jo ek kanoon kaa paalan karne kaa mukhya uddeshy he, yaa divine gun kaa varnan karne kaa mul uddeshy he- or phir ek vaastavik mahatv he ki ek quran kii kahani kaa sandarbh he
 According to Shia beliefs, which are strongly rooted in knowledge such as Muhammad and Imams, know the mysteries of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, bayaan "koi bhi bhagwaan ko chhodkar isaki vyakhya ko jaanata he" kisi bhi virdohi yaa yogyata khand ke bina maanya rahata he
 Therefore, as far as this verse is concerned, knowledge of Quranic interpretation is reserved for God
 lekin Tabatabaei anya chhandon kaa upyog karata he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki jo log bhagwaan dwaara shuddh hai quran kii vyakhya kuch had tak pataa he
 According to Tabatai, there are esoteric interpretations that are acceptable and unacceptable
 sweekaarya ta'vil apane shabdic arth se pare ek kavita ke arth ko sanderbhit karata he; balki antarnihit arth, jo antat keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he or akele maanav vichaaron ke madhyam se sidhe samajha nahin ja saktaa he
 The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, contentment, anger, and sorrow, which are clearly attributed to God
 asweekaarya ta'wil vah he jahaan ek saboot ke madhyam se ek alag arth ke liye ek kavita kaa spasht arth "sthanantarit" hota he; yah vidhi spasht visangatiyon ke bina nahin he
 Although this unacceptable Ta'wil has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to Quranic verses
 sahi vyakhya yah he ki vaastaviktaa ek kavita ko sanderbhit karti he
 It is found in all verses, decisive and ambiguous alike; This is not the meaning of the word; It is a fact that it is too fantastic for words
 bhagwaan ne unhen apane dimag main thodaa sa laane ke liye shabdon ke saath taiyaar kiya he; is sambandh main ve kahaniyon kii tarah hai jinka upyog dimag main ek tasviir banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, or is prakaar shrota ko spasht rup se icchit vichaar ko samajhane main madad milti he
 One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation before the 12th century is Sulami whose work would not have been preserved without most of the early Sufi commentaries
 sulaami kii pramukh tippanee hekik al-tafaseer kii ek pustak he jo pehle sufi kii tippaniyon kaa sankalan he
 Several other works, including commentaries from Kushayari, Dayalam, Shirazi and Suhrawardy, emerged from the 11th century
 in kaaryon main sulaami kii kitabon or lekhak ke yogadan se saamagree shaamil he
 Many works have been written in Persian such as the works of Mabri Kashf al-asrar
 rumi ne apni pustak mathnavi main vishaal rahasyamay kavita likhi thi
 Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in the translation of Rumi's work
 mathnavi main badi sankhya main kuranik maarg paae ja sakate hai, jinamein se kuch quran kii ek sufi vyakhya par vichaar karte hai
 Rumi's book is not exceptional for quotations and elaborations on the Quran, however, Rumi mentions the Quran more often
 simnani ne quran par gudh exegesis ke do prabhaavshaalee kaaryon ko likhaa tha
 He reconciled the sentiments of Sunni Islam with the ideas and manifestations of God in the material world
 18 veen shatabdi main ismail haaki bursavi ke kaam jaise vyapak sufi tippaniyan dikhaai detii hai
 His work Ruh al-bayan is a huge marifat
 arabi main likhaa gaya he, yah lekhak ke apane vichaaron ko unke purvavartiyon ke saath jodta he
 Unlike the Salafis and Zahiri, the Shia and Sufis as well as some other Muslim philosophers believe that the meaning of the Quran is not limited to the literal aspect
 unke liye, yah ek aavashyak vichaar he ki quran main bhi aantarik pahalu hai
 Henry Corbin describes a hadith that goes back to Muhammad: quran main bahari upasthiti or ek chhipi gaharaai, ek asaadhaaran arth or ek gudh arth he
 This esoteric meaning in turn hides an esoteric meaning
 to yah saat gudh arthon ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 According to this view, it has also become clear that the internal meaning of the Quran does not eliminate or invalidate its external meaning
 iske bajaay, yah aatma kii tarah he, jo sharir ko jivan detaa he
 Corbin considers the Quran to play a role in Islamic philosophy, as nanology itself goes hand in hand with the prophet
 paath ke zahir se nipatane vaali tippaniyon ko tafaseer kaha jaataa he, or batin se nipatane vaali harmenetic or gudh tippaniyon ko tavil, jisamen paath ko isaki shuruyaat main waapas lenaa shaamil he
 Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God
 iske vipareet, kuranik shabdikta, iske baad salaphis or jahiris, yah vishwaas he ki quran ko keval iske spasht arth main hi liya janaa chahie
 The reenactment is the name of the hermeneutic style of some former Muslims who converted to Christianity
 unki style yaa punrariti vigyaapan or gaiyr-vyavasthit he or maafee maangane kii disha main taiyaar he
 This tradition of interpretation is based on the following practices: grammatical rethinking, curriculum preference, retrieval, and rethinking concession
 mukhya lekh: quran anuwadyah bhi dekhen: quran ke anuwaadon kii suchikuran kaa anuwaad hameshaa samasyagrast or kathin rahaa he
 Many argue that the Quranic text cannot be reproduced in any other language or form
 iske alaava, ek arabi shabd ke sandarbh ke aadhaar par kai arth ho sakate hai, sateek anuwaad ko or bhi kathin banaate hai
 Nevertheless, the Quran has been translated into most African, Asian and European languages

 In the 12th century, the Quran was translated into Persian by Najm al-din Abu Hafs al-nasafi

 It can be said that this discipline studies the rules and methods of proper recitation of the Quran and three main areas: proper pronunciation of consonants and vowels, rules of pause in recitation and restoration of recitation, and musical and melodic features of the text

 quran kii bhashaa thi samaan karne ke liye siriek bhashaa
 The Quran recounts the stories of many people and events heard in Jewish and Christian sacred books and devotional literature, although it differs in many details

 In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other person
 mohammad kii tulana main quran main isa kaa aksar ullekh kiya gaya he, jabaki mariyam kaa ullekh quran main kiya gaaya he or engil main nahin
 Some non-muslim groups, such as the Bahá'ís and the Druूसs, regard the Quran as sacred
 unitian universalist bhi quran se prerana lete hai
 Summaries of books such as Dietesiron, James's Protévangelin, Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Sudo Matthews bear similarities to the Quran

 After the Quran's incarnation, and the general rise of Islam, the Arabic alphabet rapidly developed into an art form
 chicago vishvavidhyalay main paas purvi bhashaaon or sabhyataaon ke professor vadaad kaadi, or yangstown state uniwarsity main islamic adhyayan ke professor mustasir mir, ke mutabik: The main areas in which the Quran made a noticeable impact on Arabic literature are dictionaries and themes; Other areas relate to the literary aspects of the Quran, especially oaths, metaphors, allegories and symbols

 allaah ne is dharti par manushya ko apana caliph banaakar bheja he
 Before sending, he had properly explained to every person that they are going to earth for a short time, after that they have to return to him

 In the same way, there are many more
 is dharti par manushya ko kaary karne kii swatantraaa he
 The means of the earth are allowed to be used

 But with this freedom, God arranged for the divine commands to be given to the human beings on the earth to live life exactly in that form, and he sent his messengers to every part of the earth, who sent the message of God to humans
 kaha jaataa he ki aise ishdooton kii sankhya 1,84,000 ke qareeb rahi
 Hazrat Muhammad was the final link in this connection
 aap ke baad ab koi doot nahin aayega kintu hazarat isa apane jivan ke shesh varsh is dharti par pun: guzaarenge
 The last book of God is in your hand, no other divine book will come now

 Because of the passage of thousands of years, in the divine orders, human beings would add their thoughts, their convenience and create a new religion and distort the original religion and create a monstrosity and many times work against the divine orders
 kyon ki har prabhavi vyakti apni shakti ke aage sab ko natmastak dekhnaa chahta tha
 After all, the last prophet Hazrat Muhammad came to this earth with the Quran and the Quran came with the challenge of God that God himself would protect it
 1500 varsh kaa lambaa samay yah bataata he ki koran virodhiyon ke saare prayaason ke baad bhi koran ke ek shabd main bhi parivartan sambhav nahin ho sakaa he

 iske saath koran kaa yah chalange bhi apane sthaan par abhi tak qaayam he ki jo ise ishwariya granth nahin maanate hon to ve is jaisi puri kitaab nahin uskaa ek chota bhaag hi bana kar dikhaa den
 Knowing this form of the Qur'an, it should be known that this book was not given to Hazrat Muhammad in the form of reading it to the people and printed and put it in every house
 balki samay samay par 23 varshon tak aavashyaktaa anusaar yah kitaab avatarit hui or aap ne ishwar kii marzi se uske adeshon ke anusaar dharti par vah samaaj banaaya jaisaa ishwar kaa aadesh tha

 ek uljhan or saamne aati he
 According to the Quran's claim that he is for the people of the whole earth and for the rest of the time, but the Arabs of that time appear to be addressed to him
 sarsari taur par yahi lagata he ki koran us samay ke arabon ke liye hi avatarit kiya gaya tha lekin aap jab bhi kisi aise sthaan par pahunchein jab yah lage ki yah baat keval ek khaas kaal tathaa desh ke liye he, tab vahaan ruuk kar vichaar karen yaa ise note karke baad main is par vichaar karen to aap ko har baar lagegaa ki manushya har yug or har bhu bhaag kaa ek he or us par vah baat thik waisi hi lagu hoti he, jaisi us samay ke log|arabon par lagu hoti thi
 Great books have been written and can be written in relation to the Quran for Muslims
 yahaan u¬ddeshy koran kaa ek sankshipt parichay or uske ummat par kya haq hai, yaha spasht karnaa he
 There is a hadith recited from Hazrat Ali
 hazarat haaris faramaate hai ki main masjid main daakhil hua to dekha ki kuch log kuch samasyaon main jhagada kar rahe hai
 i went to Hazrat Ali and informed him
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- kya yah baaten hone lageen? maine kaha, ji haa
 Hazrat Ali ordered- Remember i have heard from Rasul Allah
 aap ne farmaaya- khabardaar raho nikat hi ek bada fitanaa sar uthayega maine arz kiya- is fitane main nijaat kaa zariyaa kya hoga? farmaaya-allaah kii kitaab
 The entire squeeze of the Quran comes in this one hadith
 koran dharti par allaah kii antim kitaab uski khyaati ke anuroop he
 It is very easy and it is also very difficult
 aasaan yah tab he jab ise yaad karne ke liye padhaa jaae
 If you do not fail in your destiny and want instruction from the Quran, then Allah has made this book easy
 samajhane or yaad karne ke liye yah vishwa kii sabase aasaan kitaab he
 It is in the Qur'an itself 'and we have made it easy to understand the Qur'an, so is there anyone to think and understand?' In the same way, there are many more

 The world is progressing continuously, human knowledge is increasing continuously, which was defunct yesterday in the Quran, today it has become clear, and tomorrow some parts of it will be clear
 isi tarah gnanarjan ke liye bhi do vibhinn tareeqe apnaanaa honge
 In the Qur'an in terms of orders, the contemplator must travel backwards

 ) And what did Sahaba mean by this
 yahaan tak ki khud ko hazarat mohammad ke qadamon tak pahunchaa de ki khud sahabe koran kaa is bare main kya aadesh tha? On the other hand, in terms of knowledge, it has to be considered further and continuously forward
 samay ke saath hi nahin usase aage chalaa jaae
 The surface of human knowledge is constantly increasing
 koran main vigyaan kaa sarvocch str he us par vichaar kar nae avishkaar, khoj or jo vaigyanik tathy hai un par kaary kiya ja saktaa he
 Mouzaza refers to a miracle that is on the hands of a prophet or Rasul and is beyond human power, to which the human intellect is shocked
 In every age, whenever any Rasul reached the divine orders of man, miracles were given to him by Allah
 hazarat musa ko asa di gai, jisase kai chamatkaar dikhaae gayi
 Hazrat Isa was given the opportunity to resurrect the dead, to heal the sick
 kisi bhi nabi kaa asal muajaza vah he jise vah daawey ke saath pesh kare
 Hundreds of Mojaz are described on the hand of Hazrat Muhammad, but the claim which is presented with the claim and which is still present to the world as a miracle, is the Qur'an which this disciple of the world is unanswered
 Be made as shown
 yah daawa koran main kai sthaan par kiya gaya
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran purna rup se surakshit rahegaa, is daawey ko 1500 varsh biit gaye or koran surakshit he, purna surakshit he
 This has been proven, which is a miracle
 The Qur'an has stood the test of science, and its scientific narratives are preceded by scientific efforts
 yah bhi ek chamatkaar he
 1500 years ago in the Arabian desert, an illiterate person presented a book that showed its truth in front of all the instruments of the twentieth century
 yah kaary koran ke atirikt kisi anya kitaab ne kiya ho to vishwa uskaa naam jaananaa chahega
 This miraculous form of the Qur'an is for us today and may be another miraculous form of it for the time to come
 jis samay koran avtarit hua us yug main uskaa mukhya chamatkaar uskaa vaigyanik aadhaar nahin tha
 The miracle of the Quran in that era was its language, literature, eloquence, which shook the language knowledge of the Arabs of its time
 yahaan spasht karnaa uchit hoga ki us samay ke arabon ko apane bhashaa gyaan par itnaa garv tha ki ve shesh vishwa ke logon ko ajami kehete the
 Due to the style of the Qur'an, the Arabic linguists fell on their knees
 koran aisi kitaab he jiske aadhaar par ek kranti laai gai
 Such illiterate people of the desert who had no importance in the world map at that time
 koran kii shikshaaon ke kaaran, uske prastutakarta kii training ne unhe us samay kii mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh laa khadaa kiya or ek aise korani samaaj kii rachana maatr 23 varshon main kii gai jiskaa uttar vishwa kabhi nahin de saktaa
 Even today, the world believes that the Quran and Hazrat Muhammad created an ideal society
 is drushti se yadi koran kaa adhyayan kiya jaae to aapako uske saath qadam mila kar chalanaa hoga
 Follow his education

 is bare main tiramizi main hazarat zayd bin araqam dwaara varnit haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki koran allaah kii rassi he jo zamin se asaman tak tani he
 The word is from Hazur, described by Hazrat Zaid
 There is another hadith mentioned in Tabrani, which states that one day when a person was brought to the Hazur Mosque, he saw some people reading the Quran sitting in a corner and explaining to each other
 yah dekh kar aap ke chehre par khushi kii lahar daud gai
 You reached that group of Sahaba and said to them - Do you believe that there is no other Mabud except Allah, i am the Messenger of Allah and the Quran is the book of Allah? Sahaba said, or Rasul Allah we testify that there is no Mabud except Allah, you are the Rasool of Allah and the Quran is the Book of Allah
 tab aapane kaha, khushiyaan manaao ki koran allaah kii vah rassi he jiskaa ek sira uske haath main he or doosraa tumhaare haath main
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran allaah kii rassi is arth main bhi he ki yah musalamaanon ko aapas main baandh kar rakhata he
 The unity of ideas in them, at the time of differentiation, presents a perfect model for judgment and life by the orders of Allah
 It is in the Qur'an itself to hold the rope of Allah firmly
 koran ke mul aadhaar par musalamaanon ke kisi gut main koi takaraav nahin he
 The Right to the Qur'an has five rights on every Muslim of the Qur'an, which he should fulfill according to his power and ability
 koran ko samajhane ke liye uske avateern kii prishth bhoomi jaananaa zaruri he
 This is not the kind of book that has been written in full and given to the Prophet that he should go and call people
 balki koran thodaa thodaa us kranti ke avasar par jo hazarat mohammad ne arab main aarambh kii thi, aavashyaktaa ke anusaar avatarit kiya gaya
 From the beginning, as soon as some part of the Qur'an descended, you would write it down and also tell with whom it would be read
 avateern ke kram se vidwaanon ne koran ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the Makki portion, the other the Madni part
 aarambh main makke main choti choti suuratein nazil huin
 His language was superior, effective and of the highest literary rank according to the Arabs' preference

 Their history, their atmosphere

 After this, the people who occupied the political and economic power of Mecca, sensed this danger for themselves, that they had to leave their homes and die in the small number of Muslims
 khud nabi ko ek ghati main saare parivarajanon ke saath qaid rahanaa padaa or ant main makka chhod kar madina janaa padaa
 This was a very tough time for the Muslims and the Qur'an revealed by Allah at this time was the cutting of the sword and the speed of the flood
 jisane puraa kshaitra hilaa kar rakh diya
 There are consolations for Muslims and prayers during this difficult time, which was the main part of this eight-year Quran
 is hinsaatmak prakaran se spasht hota he ki maanviya rachanadharmita evam bhaawanaaon kaa prabhaav is granth kii rachana main rahaa
 Thirteen years after the Makki era, Muslims found a center in Medina
 jahaan saare imaan laane waalon ko ekatrit kar tisare daur kaa avateern shuru hua
 Here Muslims were introduced to two new types of people
 pratham yahudee jo yahan sadiyon se aabaad the or apane dharmik vishwaas ke anusaar antim nabi kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 But when he saw the last prophet in his second demise, he created a ruckus
 koran main is daur main ahale kitaab par koran main sakht tippaniyan kii gayi
 In this era, a group of malicious people was born among the Muslims who pretended to be Muslims and kept meeting their opponents
 yaheen musalamaanon ko sashastr sangharsh kii ajna mili or unhen nirantar makka vaasiyon ke hamalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, with the establishment of an Islamic state, the divine rules were created for the creation of the whole society
 yudhd, shanti, nyaay, samaajik reeti rivaaj, khan paan sabake bare main ishwar ke aadesh is yug ke koran kii visheshta hai
 On the basis of which Rasul of Allah created an ideal state of social equality
 jiske aadhaar par aaj sadiyon baad bhi hazarat mohammad kaa kram vishwa nayakon main pratham mana jaataa he
 He did not give verbal instructions in every field of life, but showed it by following it
 is prishth bhoomi ke kaaran hi koran main kai baar ek hi baat ko baar baar doharaaya janaa lagata he
 Monotheism, religious order, heaven, hell, patience, religion are subjects of perennialism that were repeated again and again
 koran ne ek sidhe saadhe, nek vyapaaree insaan ko, jo apane parivaar main ek bharpoor jivan guzaar rahaa tha

 keval yahi nahin usne registan ke anpadh logon ko aisa sabhy bana diya ki puure vishwa par is sabhyataa kii chhap se saikadon varshon baad bhi peechha nahin chhudaaya ja saktaa
 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today

 After studying them, he said that the descriptions in the Quran regarding embryology are exactly in line with modern discoveries
 kuch aayaton ke bare main unhone kaha ki ve ise galat yaa sahi nahin kah sakate kyon ki ve khud is baat main anbhigya hai
 It also included the first verse of the Qur'an that was translated

 aise saikadon udhaaharan hai jinhe koran kii is tikaa main aap nirantar padhenge
 There is a difference of opinion that when the Qur'an is such a siddha book, why do scholars differ from Hazrat Muhammad in his commentary so far
 yahaan itnaa kahana kaaphi hoga ki paigambar mohammad ne apane anuyaayiyon main sehatmand vibhed ko badhaava diya kintu matbhinnata ke aadhaar par kattarpan or gutbandi ko aapane pasand nahin kiya

 The literal verse Qur'an descended on Hazrat Muhammad, in divine words
 yah vahya shabdic he, arth ke rup main nahin
 This has to be clarified that in Christian educational institutions, it is taught that it is not in divine words but on the heart of the prophet that he describes it in his own words
 isaiyon ke liye yah vishwaas isliye zaruri he ki bibil main jo badlaav unhone kiye hai, use ve isi prakaar satya bataa sakate the
 The entire Christian and Jewish world has been trying for centuries to somehow prove that the Qur'an is the words of Hazrat Muhammad and is his creation

 Computer users have a curiosity about whether they really need to adopt Windows Vista, the new operating system released by Microsoft
 kya microsoft ke pichley oparating system windos ekspe windos 2003 or windos 2000 kii tulana main isamen aise fitures hai jinaki andekhi karnaa sambhav na ho
 Microsoft claims that Vista is more capable, simpler, faster, smooth and secure than previous Windows
 vista pichley oparating systams kii tulana main adhik teji se khulata or band hota he
 Start up and shutdown processes are completed in five to ten seconds
 haalaanki isamen vista ke apekshaakrit behatar hardware kaa bhi yogadan he lekin khud oparating system ke code main bhi iske liye vishesh prayaas kiya gaya he
 Vista's boom is also due to its new memory management technology that keeps the most used applications ready for loading in advance
 ise 'memri fech' kaha jaataa he
 The Ready Boost feature in Vista has also contributed to its speed
 ab tak windos main memri sambandhi atirikt aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye virtual memri ke rup main pejafilon kaa istemaal hota tha
 These were placed on the computer's hard disk
 lekin vista main iske liye yuasabi drive kaa istemaal karne kaa praavdhaan he jo hard discs kii tulana main bahut tej gati se kaary karti he
 Microsoft has also provided hybrid hard drive support to its new operating system, which increases computer speed by using both flash drives and traditional hard drives combined
 windos vista main sabase pehle dhyaan khinchne vaali cheez he iskaa windos airo naamak khubasurat mukhaawaran or graphic effects
 Although such Sudarshan graphics are already present on Macintosh computers, they are first exposed through 'vista' on the Windows platform
 windos vista home premium, bijness, ultimate or enterprise sanskarnon se yukt un computaron par jinamein ek acha graphics adeptor maujuud ho, airo ke mohak graphics effects kaa anand liya ja saktaa he
 This assertion has changed the core of Windows and has made it much more attractive, diversified and decent than before

 There has been a general perception among Microsoft users about Microsoft's operating systems that they are less secure than their rival operating systems and are relatively more vulnerable to viruses, hacking, spa ware, etc
 microsoft ne vista main is baat par khaas dhyaan diya he
 Although Vista's original 'kernel' is not rewritten, its security has been strengthened this time
 pehali baat to yah ki ab is oparating system ke sabhi bhaag karnel mod main nahin chalate balki unamem se kuch chuninda hisse hi chalate hai
 Most drivers and software in Vista run in user mode and it is no longer easy to install anything in kernel mode
 iske liye sicurity certificate or administrator str ke adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 And it would be very difficult to get administrator level privileges, especially in offices

 It is also not that you as a normal user cannot install the software in your computer
 aisa karne ke liye unhen asthaayee taur par jaruri adhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Microsoft has created two categories of computers for installing Vista operating system - Vista Capable PC and Vista Premium Ready

 Cypo virus is a virus
 cypo virus pehle sapporo kii tarah virus ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa tha
 Then, there are doctors and scientists see it as a possible classical calicivirus stomach flu
 apane aap par, cypo virus ek jivan ke liye khatra virus nahin he
 According to the CDC, the virus triggers a mild form of stomach flu in humans
 yah bacchon main kaaphi prachlit he, jabaki virus sabhi umr ke logon ko prabhavit karata he
 When the virus combines with another form of line smoking policies, as the virus commonly refers to, it can trigger acute viral enteritis in adults
 cypo virus virus aamtaur par sanderbhit karne ke liye ke rup main rotawiras kaa ek or rup ke saath jodatii he, jab ve 5 varsh se kam aayu varg ke hai bacchon main pet flu jajanke trigar kar sakate hai
 The CDC states that there is a specific time limit regarding when cypo viruses can break
 prakope kisi bhi samay ho saktaa hai
 Medical studies that indicate that the virus is more common during autumn and winter months, that is, are between September and January
 is avadhi ke dauraan, yah ki aap acchhee tarah se kiya ja rahaa apane bacchon ke baad dekho mahatvapurn he
 Cypo virus on its own is not a life threatening disease
 haalanki, jab yah villin ho jaati he rotawiras or rekha dhumrapaan karne nitiyon kii tarah virus ke anya prakaaron ke saath yah pet flu, jo bhi aamtaur par karne ke liye vayaskon or bacchon donon main antrashoth ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he ki ek gambhir rup ho saktaa he
 The incubation period that merges with the cypo virus may vary depending on the type of virus
 cypo virus rekha dhumrapaan karne nitiyon ke saath villin ho jaati he, jab ooshmaayan avadhi 1-3 dinon se range kar sakate hai
 In this context, see the incubation period of time in the body before symptomatic manifestation of the virus
 ooshmaayan avadhi ke dauraan, rogi rog sanchaarit karne main sakasham nahin he
 However, the symptoms may occur from the time the infection is cured after 2 weeks to spread the infection
 sidisi ke anusaar, rotawiras bacchon main dast kaa praathmik kaaran he
 Contrary to line smoking policies, the virus is quite contagious during the incubation period and 2 weeks post treatment
 ooshmaayan avadhi rotawiras ke liye 1-2 din se alag ho saktaa he
 Since the immune system in children is still developing, they become more contagious compared to adults
 vahaan kai lakshan he ki ek marij pradarshit ho saktaa he jab cypo virus se peedit hai
 While some common symptoms of abdominal pain, dehydration and vomiting are linked to cypo virus, this symptom may differ from one patient to another who is merged with cypo virus depending on the virus
 Is important for

 The absorption of light by substances is according to "lambert's Law of Absorption"
 lambert ne 1760 i
 main prayogon dwaara gyaat kiya ki kisi samang avasoranakari madhyam ke baraabar motiwali tahen apane andar se guzarati hui prakaash kii tivrata kaa samaan anupaat main avasorana karti hai
 This rule is expressed by the following equation: Ia = Ii exp Here = emergency light intensity; = The intensity of the transmitted light and the thickness of the fold of the medium
 ko avasorana gunank kehete hai
 The basis of natural logarithms
 rabart bunsen ne ke sthaan par lop gunank kaa prayog kiya
 The omission coefficient is the inverse thickness of the fold at which the acceleration of the incident light becomes one-tenth of what it was initially
 e = 0

 Beer's absorption rule Beer expanded Labert's absorption law in 1852 AD
 usne vilyan ke madhyam dwaara prakaash ke avasorana kaa praayogic adhyayan kiya or is adhyayan ke falswaroop "bear kaa avasorana niyam' pratipaadit kiya
 Express this rule by the following equation: Ia = Ii exp xxrep 11 
 Or Ia = I1

 jab sandratha c gramanu main hoti he to k anvik avasorana gunank kehalaata he or e 'gramanu lop gunank' kehete hai

 When a photon is very close to a single molecule, the photon is either completely absorbed or absorbed, and is again emitted as a photon of another energy
 jo photon purnat: avashoshit ho jaataa he uskaa roopantaran nimnlikhit prakaaron se hota he : 1
 The heat of the heat absorbing system increases
 2
 vighatan anu apane chote chote ghatakon main vighatit ho jaataa he jaise kakh ® +hn k+ kha
 3
 The excited molecule absorbs energy until it reacts chemically with another molecule, or it transfers energy to another molecule that uses it to bring about chemical changes

 It has been proved by experiments that all types of chemical reactions such as dissolution, reconfiguration, additive, multiplication series, light catalytic reactions can occur by light
 prakaash rasinic abhikriyaaon kii vyakhya karne ke liye do niyamon ko pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 The first rule is known as "grathus Draper's Rule"
 yah niyam gunatmak he
 According to this law, the same light produces chemical reactions in substances which are absorbed from them
 kintu iskaa yah arth nahin ki vah sabhi prakaash rasinic abhikriya kaa srijan hi karata he jo padaartho dwaara avashoshit ho jaataa he
 Often this absorbed light gets converted into heat, which increases the temperature of the substances
 doosraa niyam "oinstin kaa prakaash rasinic tulyata niyam" ke naam se prasiddh he
 This rule is important for theoretical interpretation of photochemical processes
 kwantum siddhant kaa upyog karke oinstin ne is niyam ko pratipaadit kiya
 According to this law, the absorbing substance absorbs light into quanta and the primary process of photochemical transformation is that an absorbing molecule absorbs only one quantum hn of light
 kisi prakaash rasinic paraveerthan kaa jo antim fal hota he vah avasoranakari anu kii badi hui rasinic kriyasheeltaa ke kaaran he, is kriyasheeltaa ke kaaran yah tantra ke gaun rasinic kriyaaon main bhaag letaa he
 The final fruit is the compiled fruit of primary and secondary verbs
 oinstin ke niyam ke anusaar praathmik kriya main kisi padaarth kaa ek gramanu 6
02 x 10E23 quanta kaa avasorana karata he
 This "grammar quanta" is called an "einstein"
 agar n aavriti kaa "photon' ek gramanu dwaara avashoshit hota he to avashoshit urja E, Nh n ke baraabar hogi, jahaan n = ek gramanu main anuon kii sankhya = 6
02 x 10E23
 If the wavelength of the absorbed photon is l, then n = c / l, c is the sign of the velocity of light
 agar l angstrum main he to e = arg prati gramanu hua
 For convenience, energy is expressed in calories
 ek calori 4
184 x 10E7 arg ke baraabar hota he
 Therefore, calories per gram
 upar likhit sameekaran main N, h, tathaa c kaa mulya rakhane par e = kilo calories per gram
 is e ko oinstin kehete hai jo l lambaai ke vikiran dwaara praapt hoti he
 It is clear from the above facts that the energy absorbed per gramma is increased by the increase of l and the energy absorbed by red light is attenuated
 prakaash rasinic abhikriyaaon kaa fal praaia: prakriya kii kwantum kshamta dwaara pragat karte hai
 The definition of quantum potential is the following: The number of light absorbing grammars that participate in a chemical reaction by absorbing an Einstein of light is called the quantum potential of that reaction
 usko ham is prakaar bhi kah sakate hai ki prakaash ke ek kwantum kaa avasorana karke kitne anu pratikriya main bhaag lete hai
 According to Einstein's law, a grammar will participate in the process by absorbing an Einstein
 at: yah aashaa kii jaati he ki kisi bhi prakaash rasinic abhikriya kii, jisamen keval prakaash se hi pratikriya hoti he kwantum kshamta ek hogi
 It has been known by experiments that the quantum potential in Ini Guinea chemical reactions is one or the closest to one
 adhiktar abhikriya main yah ek se yaa to adhik hogi yaa kam
 Generally, one, two or three quantum potentials are very common but there are some photochemical reactions in which it is either very high or, very rarely
 oinstin ke niyam tathaa praayogic parinaamon main jo abhaasi antar he uski vyakhya nimnlikhit rup se kii gai he
 It is now assumed that Einstein's law applies only to the primary action in which the actual absorption of light occurs but it is often that the substances produced in the primary action are coupled to the repulsive molecule at a later thermal Participate in verbs
 in tapiya kriyaaon ko gaun kriya kehete hai
 In other words, although the quantum potential of an elementary action is one, the quantum potential obtained by secondary actions is one, and the quantum potential that is obtained by secondary actions is different from the one
 
 kisi bhi prakaash rasinic abhikriya kii kwantum kshamta ke vaastavik mulya se gaun kriya kaa swabhaav tathaa inaki kriya samajhane main badi madad milti he
 For example, the quantum potential for photochemical dissolution of hydrogen iodide is two
 at: sampurna abhikriya kaa kram nimnlikhit he : HI + hn -> H ́ i HI + h --> H2 + i i + i -> I2 , or ke yoga se 2H i + hn --> H2 + i One of the main aims of studying photochemical reactions is to find out the quantum potential of any reaction by experiment
 iske liye kwantum kshamta, j = se pragat karnaa vaanchhneeya he
 The familiar chemical analysis methods are known by how many granules of light-absorbing material participate in action per second
 chunki oinstin kaa mulya prakaash tarangadairghy yaa aavriti par nirbhar karata he yaa prakaash rasinic abhikriya ke praayogic adhyayan ke liye ekvarni prakaash kaa upyog karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Monochromatic light means light of a certain wavelength
 ekvarni prakaash kii ati parishuddh twrita "tapiyapunj' dwaara gyaat ho jaati he
 Thermal heat changes the light heat and the electric carrying force generated by this heat is determined by electromagnetic instruments
 vidyutadvahak bal kii maap kriyaatantr kii anupasthiti tathaa upasthiti donon main karte hai
 The difference between these two is known by how much Einstein is absorbed
 kai kaaryo main tapiya punj se jitani parishuddh maap hoti he uski aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Therefore, the light energy absorbed for all these functions is determined by a beam of light or power cell
 kiran kriyamapi ek yukti he jiske dwaara prakaash rasinic parivartanon main kitni vikiran urja avashoshit hui gyaat karte hai
 Nowadays, a uranyl oxalate ray mechanometer is the main type of ray mechanics used
 isamen ek paardarshak paatr main urenil sulphate tathaa oxelic amla kaa tanu vilyan rakhte hai
 Oxalic acid is dissolved when this beam illuminates the spectrometer by a violet or violet radiation
 prayog ke ant main oxelic amla kii kitni maatra vighitit hui isko vilyan main bache hue oxelic amla kaa pautacium paramanganet dwaara anumaapan karke gyaat karte hai
 Before starting the experiment, this beam spectrometer is standardized at different wavelengths of light
 oxelic amla kii kitni maatra vighatit hui isko gyaat karke kitne oinstin kaa avasorana hua gyaat ho jaataa he
 Like the use of thermal mass, the Einstein absorbed in it is also measured in the absence and presence of mechanism
 is prakaar kiran kriyamapi dwaara jitani urja lee gai un donon ke antar ke baraabar urja, kriyaatantr dwaara avashoshit hui
 Laton and Forbes have studied photochemical reactions with extreme caution and precision by measuring beam activity
 yadhyapi kwantum kshamta tarang kii lambaai ke saath thodi bahut badalati he phir bhi maan liya gaya he ki ek mishrit vilyan dwaara, jisamen urenil sulphate tathaa oxelic amla kii sandratha kramash: 0

05 gram anu prati litre he, 2540-4350 angstrum ke prakashtarang ke kwantum ke avasorana se oxelic amla ke 0
57 anu kaa vighatan hota he
 In other words, a granule of oxalic acid will dissolve by 1
75 isan of wavelength of 3,000 angstrum
 tapiya kriyaaon kii bhanti prakaash rasinic abhikriyaaon kii gati kii abhikaarakon kii sandratha, daab, vilyan swabhaav tathaa utprerak kii sandratha aadi par nirbhar karti he
 These reactions are much less affected by heat than thermal reactions
 inkaa taap gunank bahut hi ksheen hota he
 Photosensitive reactions are also covered under photochemistry
 bahut si kriyaaon main prakaash avasorak anu kriya main swayan bhaag na lekar keval urjavahak kaa kaary karata he
 a best example of this is the atoms of mercury vapor, which are absorbed into the active state by absorbing 2,537 angstrom ultraviolet radiation
 is vikiran kii urja 1,12,000 calori prati gramanu he
 1,02,400 kcal is required to decompose one gram of hydrogen gas into an atom; 2537 Angstrum wavelength energy is more than this
 kintu agar hydrogen gas ko thande pardwashp lap dwaara praapt 2537 angstrum se aalokit karte hai to uske anuao kaa parmaanuon main vighatan nahin hota
 But if the hydrogen molecule breaks down into an atom
 kriya kaa kram nimnlikhit rasinic samikarnon dwaara pragat karte hai : Hg + 2,537 Angstrum = Hg *; H2 + Hg * = Hg + 2H Hydrogen gas is transparent to 2,537 angstrom-radiation
 paarad vaashp parmaanu prakaash-sugraahak kaary karata he
 The hydrogen atoms thus obtained are highly reactive; They reduce metallic oxides, nitrous oxide, ethylene, carbon monoxide and other substances with quickness and ease
 uttejit paarad parmaanu keval hydrogen kaa hi nahin balki ammonia tathaa anya carbonic padaartho kaa bhi vighatan karte hai
 Apart from the mercury atom, there are many other examples of light receptors such as chlorine, bromine, ozone and uranyl oxalate
 prakaash sugrahikarniya abhikriyaayein sabhi avasthaa 3⁄4 thos, drav tathaa gas-main hoti hai
 Different types of photochemical reactions are done by which waves of light and their quantum potential, they have been studied with many compounds
 prakaash rasayan ke adhyayan ke kuch mahatvapurn vyaavhaarik prayojan hai
 Some reactions have commercial utility
 in abhikriyaaon main mukhya rup se shrinkhalaa tathaa bahulikaran prakriyaayein aati he
 Substances that are synthesized from small amounts of light are of commercial importance
 vikiran urja ke vinaashkari prabhaav bhi anek hai, jaise rang kaa ud janaa, rabar kaa hraas, kuch bahulkon kaa vichchhedan
 It is necessary to address these destructive effects in the industry
 prakaash rasinic vidhiyon dwaara swatantramulak tathaa sakriyashil parmaanu aavashyaktaanusaar sugamawa se utpann kiye ja sakate hai
