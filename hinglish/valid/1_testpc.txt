 In ancient times, there have been many sakas and many times jauhar in Rajasthan
 johar puraane samay main bharat main rajput striyon dwaara kii jane vaali kriya thi
 When the defeat was certain in the war, the men would prepare themselves for the war after death and go out to get heroism and the women used to do Jauhar, that is, by setting fire to the Jauhar Kund itself they jumped into it
 johar kar lene kaa kaaran yuddh main haar hone par shatru raja dwaara haran kiye jane kaa bhay hota tha
 First Saka; It was in 1303 that Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khilji invaded Chittor after the Ranthambore conquest
 allaudin khilji kii samrajyavaadee mahatvakanksha tathaa rana ratan singh kii sundari maharani padmini ko paane kii laalasaa is hamale kaa kaaran bani
 Second Saka; It was in 1534-35 when Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat attacked Chittor with a huge army
 rajmata rani karnavati durg kii saikadon viranganaon ne johar kaa anushthan kar apane praanon kii aahuti di thi
 Similarly the third Saka; During the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar, Chittor was strongly attacked
 yah saaka jaimal or fatta sisodiya ke parakram or balidaan ke liye prasiddh he
 The first Saka in Jaisalmer happened when Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khilji attacked with a huge army and surrounded the fort
 isamen bhaati shaasha rawal mulraj, kunwar ratan singh sahit aganit yoddhaon ne asidhaara tirth main snaan kiya tathaa lalanaon ne johar kaa anushthan kiya
 The second Saka occurred in the early years of the rule of Ferozeshah Tughlaq, Rawal Duda Triloksi and other Bhati chieftains and warriors who fought the enemy army, found Veeragati and Durgastha Veeranganas performed Jauhar
 teesraa saaka ardh saaka kehalaata he isamen veeron ne kesaria to kiya lekin johar nahin hua atah ise aadha saaka hi mana jaataa he yah ghatana 1550 isvi kii he jab raav lunkaran vahaan kaa shaasha tha
 The famous Saka of Ranthambore took place in 1301 AD when the mighty ruler Rao Hammir Dev Chauhan surprised the rebel generals of Alauddin Khilji with his ideal of refugee Vatsalata and secured valor along with trusted warriors and fortified the queens while protecting their own Heroic women performed the ritual of Jauhar
 gagron kaa pehla saaka san 1422 isvi main hua jab vahaan ke atul parakramee shaasha achaldaas khinchi ke shasankaal main mandu ke sultan alpakhaan gori urf ne akraman kiya
 As a result there was a struggle in which Achaladas, along with his brothers Bandhavas and warriors, attained heroism while battling the enemy and other queens of the fort were given their queens home in the flame of Jauhar
 achaldaas khinchi ri vachanika main iskaa vistaar se varnan hua he
 Gagaron's second saka occurred in 1444 AD when Sultan Mahmud Khilji of Mandu attacked this fort with a huge army

 The mass of a photon is zero

 The modern form of photons was given by "albert Einstein" by his experiments which could not describe the wave form of light

 saarvbhaum sarvocch vidhi nirmaataa evam niyantrak hota he yani samprabhutaa rajya kii sarvocch shakti he
 The rise of the modern state in Europe resulted in the concept of 'sovereignty' in the seventeenth century
 madhya europe main europee rajshahiyon or samrajyon main satta raja, pope or saamanton ke bich banti rahati thi
 The decline of the recognition of the Catholic Church in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries led to the disintegration of feudalism and the rise of Protestant faith gave sovereign states a chance to flourish
 samprabhutaa kaa matlab he - 'sampoorn or aseemit satta'
 But its implications are not so simple
 mahaz is arth se yah pataa nahin chalata ki akhir is sampoorn satta kii sanrachana main kya-kya shaamil he? kya iskaa matlab kisi sarvocch vaidhanik praadhikaar se hota he yaa phir iskaa sambandh ek aisi raajnneetik satta se he jise chunauti na di ja sake? Due to similar disputes over the meaning of sovereignty, it has been understood since the nineteenth century by dividing it into two parts: legal sovereignty and political sovereignty
 is avadharana ko vyaavhaarik rup se aantarik samprabhutaa or bahya samprabhutaa ke taur par bhi grahan kiya jaataa he
 The internal version of sovereignty means the division of power within the state, the supreme power within the political system
 bahya sanskaran kaa taatpary he antarrashtriya vyavastha ke tahat rajya dwaara ek swatantra or swytt vajood kii tarah sakriy rah paane kii kshamta kaa pradarshan
 The concept of sovereignty is also rooted in the basis of modern nation and nationalism
 rashtriya swatantraaa, swa-shashan or samprabhutaa ke vichaaron ke mili-jule prabhaav ke bina a-upniveshikaran ke us silsile kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati jiske tahat dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke baad asia, africa or laathini america main bade paimaane par naye rashtron kii rachana hui
 There is an intellectual history of the difference between legal and political sovereignty which has to be looked at to understand the differences between Jean Boaden and Thomas Hobbes
 bodaan ne apni rachana da sicks books of kaamanvil main ek aise samprabhu ke paksh main tark diya he jo khud kanoon banaata he, par swayan ko un kanoonon ke upar rakhata he
 According to this view, law means to run people on the orders of the sovereign
 iskaa matlab yah nahin bodaan yahan kisi nirankush shaasha kii vakaalat karnaa chaahate the
 He believed that the sovereign ruler who made and complied with the law would be subject to a higher law
 yani loukik shaasha ke praadhikaar par daivi kanoon kii muhar zaruri hogi
 Contrary to Bodan's view, Hobbes in his composition Leviathan describes the idea of sovereignty not in terms of authority, but in terms of power
 hobbs se pehle saint augusteen ne ek aise samprabhu kii zarurat par bal diya tha jo maanavtaa main antarnihit naitik buraaiyon ko kaabo main rakhega
 Further developing this logic, Hobbes, while defining sovereignty as a monopoly on the oppressive power, recommended that this power should be in the hands of the ruler alone
 haalaanki hobbs nirbaadh rajshahi ko praathamikta dete the, par ve yah maanane ke liye bhi taiyaar the yah satta shaskaon ke ek chote se gut yaa kisi loktantric sabha ke haath main bhi ho sakati he
 This debate between Bodas and Hobbes suggests that legal sovereignty rests on state law as paramount
 iske vipareet raajnneetik samprabhutaa satta ke vaastavik vitaran se judi hui he
 Despite this difference, one also has to believe that the practical notion of sovereignty has legal aspects as well as political aspects
 aadhunik rajyon kii samprabhutaa kanoon kii sarvoparita par bhi nirbhar he or us kanoon kaa anupaalan karwaane vaale sattamulak tantra par bhi jiske paas damankaaree mashinari hoti he
 No law applies merely on the basis of moral obligations
 dand dene vaali vyavastha, police, jail or adaalaton ke bina use kaayam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This equation of legal and political sovereignty seems to be effective on both sides
 kanoon ko apane anupaalan ke liye agar satta ke tantra kii zarurat he, to satta ko apni vaidhata ke liye kanoon kii sanstuti kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Governance has to be lawful and constitutional, only then its legitimacy is maintained
 keval raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke dam par taanashaah sarkarein hi kaam karti hai
 If the government is democratic then its oppressive machinery has to remain accountable before the courts by staying within the boundaries of law
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik swaroop ke prashn par raajnneetik siddhant ke daayaron main kaafii bahes hui he
 After all, what should be the place of supreme and unlimited power? Would it be better to place it in the hands of one ruler or would it be better to have its center vested in a representative institution? In the seventeenth century, Emperor Louis Fourteenth of France told Darp that i am the kingdom
 ek vyakti ke haath main samprabhutaa dene ke peeche tark yah he ki us surat main samprabhutaa ke avibhajya hone kaa guarantee rahegi
 His expression will be in one voice and no other authority will interfere in it
 samprabhutaa kii is sarvasattavadi dharna main prabhaavshaalee hastkshep attharahavin sadi main kiya gaya jab jyaan-zaak ruso ne lokapriy samprabhutaa kii avadharana pesh kii
 Russo, rejecting the rule of the monarchy, wrote in his composition Social Contract: 'man is born free, but everywhere he is held in chains
 ’ darasal, soshal kantrect aadhunik raajnneetik darshan ko ekadam nayaa rup de detii he
 Their social agreement is different from Hobbes and Locke's social settlement
 ruso se pehle ke darshanikon kaa yakeen tha ki manushya apni buddhigat kshamtaaon ke kaaran duusare praaniyon se bhinn he, jabaki ruso maanate hai ki insaan naitik chunaav kii kshamta ke kaaran alag he
 If he is not given the freedom to make this election, he will be nothing more than a slave
 chunki samaaj tarah-tarah kii a-swatantraaaon se bharaa hua he or manushya apni prakritik swatantraaa ke shuruaati sansar main nahin laut saktaa, isliye ruso tajaviz karte hai ki use apni us azaadi kaa vinimay naagarik swatantraaa se karnaa chahie
 For this, human beings will have to form associations with each other, social existence will be created under which all people will relinquish their rights and in turn get rights as citizens, will remain as members of one sovereign
 arthath ek samvidhan bananaa padegaa jiske tahat har vyakti adheen bhi hoga or sahabhaagi naagarik bhi
 Only this way freedom can be guaranteed
 yah loktantr kii avadharana thi, par ruso janata ke pratinidhiyon dwaara chalaaye jane vaale loktantr yaa vidhi-nirmaan se sahamat nahin the
 Like the direct democracy of ancient Greece, Rousseau wanted all citizens to congregate in a public place and formulate a law
 alpamat ko bahumat dwaara liye gayi nirnay ke adheen hone se bachaane ke liye ruso ne sarvasammati kaa paksh liya jise kargar banane ke liye unhone apane sabase vikhyath siddhant ‘jan-ichha’ kaa sutrikaran kiya
 Following the law created on the basis of 'public will' meant to follow one's own will
 ruso dwaara pravartit ‘jan-ichha’ kaa siddhant aage chal kar aadhunik loktantric siddhant kaa aadhaar bana
 Rousseau envisioned a comfortable community of citizens who would be the bearers of equality and unity beyond high-altitude relations, so he believed that it would be easy to provide 'public will' among them
 lekin ruso kabhi is prashn kaa uttar nahin de paye ki nagarikon kii aam sabha main vyakt kii jane vaali ichchhaaon main se ‘jarnal-vil’ kaise niklegi
 Therefore, in the end, they were seen saying that if 'people's will' is not available, then the will of the majority should be considered synonymous
 samprabhutaa ke siddhant ko udaarataavaadi-loktantric vichaar ke pairokaron ne aade haathon bhi liya he
 He says that the notion of sovereignty is unnecessary in the context of pluralistic and democratic governance
 ye log samprabhutaa ke vichaar ko uske sarvasattavadi ateet se peedit or isliye avaanchhneeya maanate hai
 He says that democratic governments are not run by the allegedly lawful regime imposed by the oppressive machinery
 ve to niyantran or santulan ke sameekaran or uske aadhaar par bane network ke zariye shashan karti hai
 Indeed, in modern states with a federal character, it is very difficult to determine the center of internal sovereignty
 sanyukt rajya america, canada, osterelia or bharat jaise sanghatmak rajyon main sarkaar do staron main vibhajit he or prayek str ke paas apane swytt adhikaar hai
 Sovereignty in such states emerges as a partnership between the center and the periphery
 aisi paristhiti main agar koi avibhajit samprabhu he to vah he samvidhan jo centre ko bhi samprabhutaa sampann banaata he or rajyon ko bhi
 External sovereignty signifies the status of a state in the international system
 is tarah kii paristhitiyaan bhi hoti hai ki kisi rajya main aantarik samprabhutaa par vivaad chalata rahata he, par antarrashtriya kshetra main uski bahya samprabhutaa kaa aadar kiya jaataa he
 Anyway, in the era of democracies, issues of internal sovereignty are no longer considered so important, but the question of external sovereignty has become more important than ever
 aise kai antarrashtriya vivaad hai jinamein ek desh kii samprabhutaa kaa daawa duusare desh kii taraf se apni samprabhutaa ke liye chunauti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The movement by the Palestinians for their sovereign nation is considered by Israel to be the cause of the decline of its sovereignty

 esaech keval satyapit karata he ki kya saarvajanik vyakti kii peshkash karne vaala vahi vyakti milan karne vaali nijee kunjee kaa maalik he
 It is important to verify unknown public keys in all versions of SSH, that is, before accepting them as valid, associate the public key with the identity

 Now he wanted to expand to Punjab
 kintu us samay punjab par mohammad gauri kaa raaj tha
 By 1190 AD, the whole of Punjab was occupied by Muhammad Ghori
 ab vah bhatinda se apana rajkaaj chalata tha
 Prithviraj knew very well that it was impossible to establish the Chauhan Empire in Punjab without fighting Mohammad Ghauri
 yahi vichaar kar usne gauri se nipatane kaa nirnay liya
 To materialize this decision, Prithviraj left for Punjab with a huge army
 teevr kaarywahi karte hue usne haansi, saraswati or sarhind ke kilon par apana adhikaar kar liya
 Meanwhile, he received information that the rebels in Anheelwada had revolted against him
 punjab se vah anhilwara kii or chal pade
 Gauri attacked behind them and took the fort of Sirhind again
 prithviraj ne sheeghra hi anhilwara ke vidroh ko kuchal diya
 Now he decided to wage a decisive battle with Gauri
 usne apni sena ko nae dhang se susajjit kiya or yuddh ke liye chal diya
 There was a fierce battle in the army of Khet Singh Khangar, the commander of Prithviraj on the banks of river Ravi, but nothing came out
 yah dekh kar prithviraj gauri ko sabak sikhaane ke liye aage badha
 The battle was fought at a place called Tarain, 14 miles from Thaneshwar and near the fort of Sirhind
 tarin ke is pehle yuddh main rajputon ne gauri kii sena ke chakke chhudaa die
 Gauri's soldiers started saving life
 jo bhaag gaya uske praan batch gaye, kintu jo saamne aayaa use gaajar-muuli kii tarah kaat daalaa gaya
 Sultan Muhammad Ghori was badly wounded in the war
 apane unche turki ghode se vah ghayal avasthaa main girane hi vaala tha kii yuddh kar rahe ek uske sainik kii drushti us par padi

 Ottoman soldiers ran in front of Rajput army
 prithviraj kii sena ne 80 mile tak in bhaagate turkon kaa peechha kiya
 But the Ottoman army did not dare to return

 He shared this wealth with his brave soldiers

 King Jayachand was badly hurt by Prithviraj Chauhan's deportation of Princess Sanyogita in this way
 uske hriday main apmaan ke tikhe tir se chubh rahe the
 He wanted the demolition of Prithviraj at any cost
 bhale hi use kuch bhi karnaa pade
 He came to know from reliable sources that Mohammad Ghauri wants to avenge his defeat with Prithviraj
 bas phir kya tha jayachand ko maano apane man kii muraad mil gayi
 He decided to kill Prithviraj by assisting Gauri
 jayachand akele prithviraj se yuddh karne kaa saahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 He thought that in this way Prithviraj will also end and the kingdom of Delhi will be given to him as a reward
 raja jayachand kii aankhon par pratishodh or swaarth kaa aisa pardaa padaa kii vah apane desh or jati kaa swabhimaan bhi tyaag baitha tha
 The result of the treason of King Jayachand was that Muhammad Ghori, who had not forgotten his defeat in the battle of Tarain, then started plotting to confront Prithviraj
 raja jayachand ne doot bhejkar gauri ko sainya sahaayta dene kaa aashwaasan diya
 After getting the help of the traitor Jayachand, Gauri immediately agreed to take revenge on Prithviraj
 jab prithviraj ko ye soochna mili kii gauri ek baar phir yuddh kii taiyaariyon main juta hua to un par koi prabhaav nahin padaa
 Prithviraj's friend and Raj poet Chandbardai requested military help from many Rajput kings to confront Muhammad Ghori's army, but due to coincidence, many Rajput kings had become antagonists of Prithviraj, at the behest of the Kannauj king
 Agreed to wage war on the side
 1192 i0 main ek baar phir prithviraj or gauri kii sena tarin ke kshetra main yuddh ke liye aamane saamne khadi thi
 a fierce battle ensued from both
 is yuddh main prithviraj kii or se 3 lakh sainikon ne bhaag liya tha jabaki gauri ke paas ek lakh bees hajaar sainik the
 The special thing about Gauri's army was that he had a powerful cavalry squad
 prithviraj ne badi hi aakraamakata se gauri kii sena par aakarman kiya
 At that time the military was used by elephants in the Indian Army
 gauri ke ghudsavaaro ne aage badhakar rajput sena ke haathiyon ko gher liya or unpar baan varsha shuru kar di
 The injured elephant could neither move forward nor backwards, but they started to flaunt their own army in fear
 tarin ke dwitiya yuddh kii sabase badi traasadee yah thi kii deshadrohi jayachand ke sanket par rajput sainik apane rajput bhaaiyon ko maar rahe the
 Secondly, Prithviraj's army did not attack at night, but the Ottoman soldiers were also attacking by night
 parinaam swaroop is yuddh main prithviraj kii haar hui or usko tathaa raaj kavi chandbardaai ko bandi bana liya gaya
 The traitor Jaichand got worse, he was killed and captured Kannauj

 ek utpaada ke jeevanchakra ke vibhinn charnon ko vyavasthit evam ekikrut karne liye anek software samaadhaan viksit kiye gayi hai
 PLM should not be seen as a single software product, rather it is a collection of software tools and functional methods that need to be taken care of at a single stage of the lifecycle or to add different functions or to manage the entire process
 Is integrated for kuch software pradaata sampurna pielem shrenee kii purti karte hai, jabaki anya keval kisi ek kshetra ke anuprayog tak simit hote hai
 Some applications may span multiple areas of PLM with different segments in a single data model
 pielem ke antargat aane vaale kshetron kaa ek avlokan yahaan samahit kiya gaya he
 However, it should be noted that simple classification does not always fit accurately, some regions overlap each other, and some software products are spread over more than one area or cannot be easily placed in one category
 We should also not forget that one of the main goals of PLM is to collect knowledge that can be used to reuse other projects and support contemporary development of many products
 vyapaarik prakriyaaon, vyaktiyon or vidhiyon ke saath bhi iskaa utana hi sambandh he, jitna software anuprayog samaadhaanon ke saath he
 Although PLM is primarily concerned with engineering functions, it also includes marketing activities such as product portfolio management), particularly in terms of new product presentation)

 Despite increasing simplicity of use of PLM equipment, it has not been proven practical to provide training to all personnel on the entire PLM equipment set
 haalanki, ab pielem kshetra ke antargat sabhi pratibhaagiyon ke liye prayog kii saralata par dhyaan dete hue kuch sudhaar kiye ja rahe hai
 One such improvement is the ability to 'play the role' of specific user interfaces

 Many established procedures have been adopted by PLM and further improved
 pielem digital ejineering takneekon ke saath, company ke lakshyon, jaise bazaar tak pahunchane main laganevaale samay main kami or kam utpaadan laagton, kii purti karne ke liye unamem sudhaar kiye gayi hai
 Reducing the time required is a major factor as getting a product to market faster than its competitor will be helpful in getting higher revenue and additional amount of profit and increasing market share
 in takneekon main shaamil hai: Concurrent engineering) is a workflow that performs parallel tasks, rather than sequentially performing multiple tasks through different stages
 udaahranarth: utpaada kii vistrut rachana purna hone se purv hi vaastavik upkaran rachana kii shuruyaat karnaa, yaa avadharana dizine sataha model purna hone se purv hi vistrut dizine thos model kii shuruyaat karnaa
 Although it is not necessary to reduce the amount of manpower required for a project, it also reduces the time required and hence the time taken to reach the market

 Some CAD packages also allow for collaborative copying of geometry between files
 yah, udaahranarth, ek bhaag ke dizine ko upkaran diziner dwaara prayukt filon main nakal karne kii anumati detaa he
 The production engineer can then start work on the equipment before the final stage stops; When a design's shape or texture changes, the equipment geometry will be updated
 Concurrent engineering adds the benefit of better and more rapid communication between departments, reducing the likelihood of costly and delayed design changes
 
 paaramparik krmanugat ejineering kii samasya samaadhaan or punarrachana vidhi kii tulana main yah ek samasya nivaaran vidhi ko apanaataa he
 Bottom-up design centered) is the design in which the definition of 3D models of a product begins with the creation of single components
 iske baad inhen abhaasiya rup se ek se adhik str kii up-asembliyon main tab tak ek saath laayaa jaataa he, jab tak ki puraa utpaada digital rup se paribhaashit na ho jaae

 BOM consists of all physical components; It may also contain the final product BOM, such as paints, sarshes, oils, and other materials, commonly referred to as 'bulk goods'
 thok vastuon main vishishtatah bhaar evam sankhya hoti he, lekin ve sadaiv hi jyamiti ke anusaar pratirupit nahin hotin
 Bottom-up design focuses on the capabilities of real-world available physical technology and executes solutions for which this technology is most appropriate
 jab in vaastavik-vishwa main in bottm-ap samaadhaanon kaa koi mahatv hota he, to bottm-ap dizine top-down dizine kii tulana main bahut adhik daksh ho saktaa he
 The risk in bottom-up design is that it provides much more efficient solutions to low-value problems
 bottm-ap dizine is baat par kendrit hota he ki "is praudyogiki ke saath ham sarvaadhik dakshatapurvak kya kar sakate hai?" na ki top-down kii tarah, jo ki is baat par kendrit hota he ki "kiya jane vaala sarvaadhik mahatvapurn kaary koun-sa he?" The top down design focuses on high-level functional requirements and has relatively little attention to current implementation technology

 top-down dizine kaa jokhim yah he ki ye, visheshtah hardware kriyanvayan ke sandarbh main, vartmaan bhautik praudyogiki ke sarvaadhik daksh anuprayogon kaa laabh nahin legaa
 When the top-down model has used a summarization path that is not efficiently integrated into the available physical-level technology, sometimes the top-down design results in excessive levels of lower-level summarization and inefficient performance Get
 top-down dizine kaa sakaaratmak paksh yah he ki ye ishtatam samaadhaan aavashyaktaaon par apana dhyaan kendrit rakhata he
 Some of the risks of a top-down design can be removed with a part-centric top-down design

 Sometimes the top-down assembly is called a control structure
 yadi samiksha sanrachana ke liye leout va maapdand paribhaashit karne hetu ek ekal file kaa prayog kiya gaya ho, to aksar ise ek scaleiton file kaha jaataa he
 Traditionally, defense engineering develops the product structure in a top-down method
 systams ejineering prakriya aavashyaktaaon kaa ek kaaryaatmak vighatan nirdhaarit karti he or uske baad kaaryon ke liye utpaada sanrachana kaa bhautik aavanton karti he
 Generally this top-down method will have lower levels of product structure developed from cad data in the form of bottom-up structure or design

 The flow of a BEATM design process can begin with an emerging technology that can suggest valuable solutions, or it can also begin with a top-down approach to a problem that requires a solution
 kisi bhi sthiti main, dizine prakriya ke donon chhoron par turant dhyaan kendrit karnaa hi beietm dizine kaary paddati kaa mukhya gun hota he: samaadhaan aavashyaktaaon kaa ek top-down drushtikon tathaa kisi aisi praudyogiki, jo ek daksh samaadhaan pradaan kar paane kaa vaada karti ho, kaa bottm-ap drushtikon
 beietm dizine prakriya top-down aavashyaktaaon tathaa bottm-ap daksh kriyanvayan ke bich kisi bindu par ek ishtatam vilay kii khoj main donon chhoron se aage badhati he
 Thus, BEATM has been faithfully presenting the best of both practices

 If used consciously, BEATM provides even more powerful benefits
 top-down dizine ko agle charan par le janaa agrabharan he
 The complete control structure and review structure, as well as low-level data such as drawings, equipment development, and cam models, are created before the product is defined or the start of a project is authorized
 filon kii ye assemblyz ek template kii rachana karti hai, jinase utpaadon kii ek shrinkhalaa kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 When a decision has been made to go with the new product, the product parameters are entered into this template model and all data related to it is updated
 swaabhaavik rup se purv nirdhaarit sahachaari model sabhi sambhaavnaaon kaa purvanumaan kar paane main sakasham nahin honge or unamem atirikt kaary kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 The main principle is that many experimental / research works have already been completed
 in templeton main bahut sara gyaan nirmit he, jiskaa nae utpaadon main punarprayog kiya janaa hota he
 This requires additional "advance" resources, but it can drastically reduce the time between project initiation and release

 Its symbol is S
 kisi nikaay kii kul urja kaa vah bhaag jise upyog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa, us nikaay kii entropy kehalaati he
 The mathematical definition of entropy is given below
 germany ke ganitagya evam bhautikashastri rudolph classias ne 1850 ke dashak main entropy kii sankalpana di or uskaa yah naam diya
 In 1877 Ludwig Boltzmann gave a definition based on probability of entropy
 ooshmaagatiki ushmagatiki ke dwitiya niyam dwaara bhi ek nae sankalpana kaa samavesh hota he
 This is the concept of entropy
 anya sankalpanaaon kii apeksha adhik amoort hone ke kaaran isko samajhnaa bhi adhik kathin he
 The main things about entropy are given below- ooshmaagatikeey rup se vyutkramntic kisi nikaay ke liye entropy main parivartan nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara paribhaashit he- Where t is the absolute temperature of the body, dq is the heat given to the body
 entropy kii yah paribhaasha kabhi-kabhi 'vyashtigat paribhaasha' kehalaati he
 Note that this is the definition of 'change in entropy', not of total entropy
 entropy kii sankalpana bahut upyogi paayi gayi he or isaki kai anya paribhaashaayen or bhi hai
 Later on, the definition of absolute entropy was also based on statistical mechanics or on the third law of thermodynamics
 yadi kisi prakriya main taap aparivartit ho to Using the above definition of entropy and the equation of ideal gas, the following relation can be derived- yaa, Where γ = cpc v { \ displaystyle \ gamma = { \ frac {c_ {p}} {c_ {V}}} \ ,} 1890 se 1900 kii kalavadhi main austria ke bhautikashastri ludwig boltzman or anya vaigyanikon ne sankhyikeey yantriki kaa vikaas kiya
 This greatly influenced the concept of entropy
 entropy or ooshmaagatikeey prayikta main nimnlikhit sambandh diya gaya he- Where s is the entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, ω is the number of all possible micro-states of the body

 Surdas took initiation from Vallabhacharya Ji and presented Krishna's lovelings and child sports in the color of devotion
 maadhuryabhav kii in lilaon ne janata ko bahut rasmagn kiya
 In this way two main sects were present in their time under full devotion, Ram Bhakti Branch; Krishnabhakti Branch
 iske atirikt bhi do shakhaayen prachlit huin - premumarg tathaa nirgunmarg shakha
 Parallel to this development sequence of Sagun Dhara, Muslim Sufi saints who came from outside were also spreading their ideas to the general public
 musalamaanon ke is lambe pravaas ke kaaran bhartiya tathaa muslim samskruti kaa aadan-pradaan hona swaabhaavik tha
 Then these Sufi saints also made a successful attempt to spread their ideas to the masses, to present their opinions in Indian lectures, in the Indian environment, right here
 inke maton main kattarta kaa kahin bhi abhas nahin tha
 His main principle was the element of love
 yadhyapi prem ke madhyam se ishwar ko paane ke liye kiye jane vaale prayaas main kuch antar avashya tha tathaapi inke prem tatva ke pratipaadan evam prasar style ne logon ko aakarshith kiya
 He also propounded monotheism, which some believe to be monotheism, which is not fair

 In this Sufism also four streams mainly ran - jaaysi, qutuban, manzan aadi prasiddh kaviyon ne hindi sahitya ko amuly sahitya ratna bhent kiye
 They also had an impact on the Nirgungyanashrayi Shakti branch and things were said to erase the distinction between Hindu and Muslims
 acharya shukla ne bhi inhen ’hindu or musalmaan hriday ko aamane saamne karke ajanabeepan mitaane vaala' kaha
 Ramanand ji brought Ram bhakti to North India
 unke siddhanton main is bhakthi kaa swaroop do prakaar kaa tha - ram kaa nirgun rup; ram kaa avtari rup
 Both these views were together
 nirgun rup main ram kaa naam to hota par use ’dasharath-sut’ kii katha se sambaddh nahin kiya jaataa
 Ramanand saw that after coming to the shelter of God, there is no bonding of untouchability, caste and caste etc
 Therefore, even after being blessed by Sanskrit pundits and high Brahmin clans, he wrote poetry in the country language and gave everyone the name Ram
 Preached kabir inhen ke shishy the
 Kabir, Raidas, Dhanna, Sena, Pippa etc
 his disciples made this idea famous
 ramanaam ke mantra ko lekar chalane vaale akkhad-fakkad santon ne bhed-bhav bhula kar sabko prempurvak gale lagane kii baat kahi
 Emphasizing the renunciation of obsolescence and external laws by the Vedic rituals, spread the love of Rama name, simple method of remembering with reverence and easy samadhi
 kabir main teen pramukh dharaayen samahit dikhaai detii hai - Hatha Yoga definitely has some effect on them, but the emphasis is mainly on the element of love
 saamaajik sudhaar ke kshetra main in santon kaa mahatvapurn yoga rahaa he
 In the literature of these saints, we get a glimpse of all the social, religious and political situations of the era 
 dharmik drushti se bhi inkaa yoga bahut he
 Due to the emphasis on the language of easy love, people also had a lot of inclination on them
 kabir kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad isamen bhi sampradaay kii sthapana ho gai
 Like other branches, its importance is also in making the devotee complete
 ye chaaron shakhaayen bhaktikaal yaa madhyakaal ke purv bhaag main apane utkarsh main thim
 All these four branches gave big personality to Hindi literature such as Sur, Tulsi, Kabir etc
 apane bhakthibhaav kii charam utkrushtataa ke liye bhi ye janata ke man-maanas par aadhipaty kar sake
 Even today they are seen with reverence and respect
 yadhyapi kaalaantar main in sampradaayon main bhi aniatikta ke tattvon ke pravesh ke kaaran shuddhta nahin rah gai thi tathaa inkaa patan bhi dhire-dhire ho gaya tha tathaapi jo adbhut maniyan is kaal main praapt huin, ve kisi bhi anya kaal main praapt nahin ho sakin, yah nihsandeh kaha ja saktaa he
 Art flourished in every way in the Bhaktikaal, a new environment was born, sources of devotion, love and reverence burst out among the masses, such a period is truly worthy of being called the "golden period" of literary history
 sampradaayon se mukt rup main bhi bhakthi kaa prachaar tha
 The names of Meera, Rasakhan, Rahim are taken with as much reverence as any of the saintly poets
 is tarah kaha ja saktaa he ki janata main sampradaay se bhi adhik shuddh bhakthi-bhav kii mahatta thi
 Ecumenical devotion took a collective form and engulfed the hearts of every person
 tulsi kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad hi reetikaal ke aagaman ke chihn dikhaai dene lage the
 The decadent form of Rama was normalized to include the temporal pastimes
 krishna kii prem bhakthi jaagrit karne vaali lilaon main se krishna kii shringaarik lilaon ko grahan karke uskaa ashleel chithran hone laga tha
 This situation had reached its abysmal form in Retikal
 isiilie kaha gaya tha "radhika kanhai sumarin ko bahaano he
 "the form of Rambhakti which Tulsi inscribed, though it did not tarnish, was forgotten by the poets living in the shelter of the kings in an atmosphere of adornment
 is tarah dhire-dhire i
1680-90 ke aasapaas bhaktikaal samaapt ho gaya
 Over the years, even though devotion remained in the public, neither it was able to generate great fame and neither a very popular book could be written
 bhakthi yug kaa yah aandolan bahut bada aandolan tha evam aisa aandolan bharat ne isse pehle kabhi nahin dekha tha
 This literature awakened reverence, devotion, faith, livelihood in the heart of the public, imparted courage, gaiety, love, presented a huge and encouraging picture of its motherland, its culture, patriotism was also awakened in the heart of the people for the same reason
 Happened
 bhakthiyug main is tarah mukhyat: bhaktiparak sahitya kii rachana hui parantu yah bhi purnataya nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kisi anya prakaar kaa sahitya us kaal main tha hi nahin
 This was the reign of Akbar and there were many poets in his court
 abdurrahim khaankhaana aadi kii rajprasastiparak kuch kavitaayen milti hai
 Akbar also encouraged the traditional stream of literature, so that form of poetry is also available in Kriparam's "hitarangini" Birbal's retail couplets etc
 iske atirikt niti parak dohe aadi likhe gayi
 Another great poet Acharya Keshav has been placed by Shukla ji in the retail poets of Bhaktikal
 yah kaary unhone keshav ke rachanakaal ke aadhaar par kiya he
 Shukla Ji has placed him among the great poets of this era, considering Keshav's ornamentation, verses, signs of rasa - three important compositions which represent examples - Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika, apart from devotion
 keshav kaa acharyatva puure reetikaal ko gaurav pradaan karata he
 Method - Symptoms - The tradition of determining the example also appears in them first, even if it is inappropriate to separate Keshav from the ritual for this determination in the reticulum, so it is not appropriate to keep them in devotion
 bhaktikaal main lalit kalaon kaa utkarsh dikhaai detaa he
 Pictures of various leelas of Shri Krishna and Radha are found in this period, many idols expressing gentle and succulent expressions are found in this period
 murtikla kaa bahut vikaas is yug main bahut adhik hua tha
 Muslim style coordination in architecture, painting, and consequently the use of arches, domes etc
 became more visible in Indian style
 madhyakaal main rajasthani style adhik lokapriy thi
 In addition to human paintings, marking of natural scenes, various episodes of court life, murals are also received in this era
 ’qutubameenar’, ’adhaai din kaa jhunpda’ aadi aitihaasik vaastukala ke apratim namoonay hai
 In this way, fine arts were also greatly developed along with literature
 sangeet ke kshetra main bahut pragati hui
 The plan of the Krishnilalas to sing, sakhi, ramani, raga to the verse is not attainable elsewhere in this period
 sur or tulsi sahitya main anek raag-raganiyon kaa varnan aata he
 In conclusion, one can say that whatever Indian literature, Indian culture and history received during the growth and development of devotion, is unique, unique and rare in itself

 dow shyamsundar das ke netritv main or acharya ramchandra shakl jaise marmajna aalochak or hidi sahityavijna ke sahaayakatv main tathaa baalkrishna bhatta shri amir sih, shri jaganmohan verma shri bhagavanadin or shri ramchandra varm ke sampadakatv main anek vidwaanon, kaaryakartaaon ke sahyog se sampadit or nirmit yah kosh ek mahaan prayaas tha
 In the editing of this Mahakosh with the consideration of means and circumstances, the masters of the assembly and the activists of the dictionary got great success
 isaki kuch uplabdhiyaan he jo stuty or abhinandaneey hai
 It can also be said that this Mahakosh was the staple and base of all the small and large shells of the Hidi, which became interchangeable with the Hindi word
 hindi koshkala ke labdhpratishth sampadak shri ramchandra verma ke is prashansaneey kaary kaa upjivy bhi mukhyatah hindi shabdhsagar hi he
 Its original form is mostly calculated from the words in the form of elemental
 hindi ke anya koshon main bhi adhikansh saamagree isi kosh se lee gai he
 Like most of the earlier Hindi dictionaries, the Hindi word ocean was not created by one person but was created by many suddis penetrating language and literature

 a very mature appropriation of grammatical system and systematic instruction of words and meanings is seen in the Hindi dictionary

 Interpretation of the meanings from the idiom and proverbs of Hindi idioms and proverbs or the use of rituals is also sufficiently mature in this
 shabdhsagar main arthnirdhaaran main vyaakhyaatmak paddati apanaai gai he
 But at the same time most synonyms have also been placed under the key words
 is kaaran kabhi kabhi aisa bhi lagata he ki yah kosh aadhunik dhang kaa paryaayavachi or nanarthak kosh ek saath ban gaya he
 Under the explanatory method, many types of introduction and description of the person, subject, object, etc
, mythological, historical, classical and traditional, are given in place
 is kaaran yah kosh vishwakosh, gyaanakosh, charitkosh or paribhaashik kosh ke parivesh kaa bhi yatra-tatra sparsh karata dekhai detaa he
 Some deficiencies can also be counted in this
 shabdon ke samast arthon kii prayogpushti or pramanikta ke nimit sarvatra udhaaharan nahin hai
 Wherever they are, nominal texts are often specified
 unek prasangsthal or sanskaran kaa ullekh nahin he
 Self-made examples of colloquialism have also been employed at many sites
 sab milakar isamen shabdasangrah or arthvivruti donon kii paridhi ko yathasambhav vyapak or vistrut banaaya gaya he
 In this area, the importance of this dictionary has increased greatly due to the combination of vocabulary stored with various professions and class life

 maudrik saudon kaa lekha karne ke pashchaat unhen unke swabhaav ke anusaar samanta ke aadhaar par pruthak pruthak samoohon main vargeekaran kiya jaataa he taaki pruthak pruthak madon ke liye pruthak pruthak suchanaaen uplabdh ho saken
 For example, to collect all the sales deals, which are written in different places, in one place, so that the total sales amount can be known
 yah kaary khatabahi main khate kholkar kiya jaataa he
 The main purpose of accounting is to provide important information for decision-makers
 is kaary ke liye varsh ke ant main sabhi khaaton ke shesh gyaat karke unase ek suchi banaai jaati he or us suchi se do vivaran- laabh-haani khaataa tathaa chittha taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 These details provide important information regarding the profitability of the business, financial condition, payment capacity etc
 is prakaar varmbhar kii samast suchnaaain sankshipt hokar do vivaranon main samaa jaati he jo vyavsaay ke antim parinaam darshaati he
 Accounting not only performs the task of accounting, classifying and summarizing but also interpreting those data to provide conclusions and useful information
 udhaahrantaya sanstha main pratyaaya kii dar kya rahi ? vigyaapan kaa prabhaav bikri main vruddhi par kitna hua? taralata tathaa bhugtan kshamta kii sthiti aadi suchanaaen uplabdh ho jaati he

 and other persons interested in the business so that they can form their opinion regarding the financial condition of the business and the future plan

 lekhankan kaa antim kaary aisi vyavastha karnaa bhi hai jisase vibhinn vaidhanik aavashyaktaaon kii purti ho sake
 There are many laws which are mandatory to be fulfilled by a businessman like submission of income tax return, sales tax return, compliance of rules made by SEBI etc
 lekhankan is kaary main sahaayta karti he
 Accounting is considered a requirement for the successful operation of modern business operations
 lekhankan kyon aavashyak he, ise nimna tarkon se spasht kiya ja saktaa he - There are several accounting systems, among which the following are notable: 1
 nakad len-dein 2
 single accounting system 3
 doharaa lekha pranali 4
 Indian bookkeeping system is pranali kaa prayog adhiktar gaiyr vyapaarik sansthaaon jaise club, anathalay, pustkaalay tathaa anya samaaj sevi sansthaaon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of these institutions is not to make profit and it only wants to know from the bookkeeping how much cash they have and how much is left and how much is left, only cash book is made under the cash system
 is pustak main saare nakad lendenon ko likhaa jaataa he
 At the end of the year no final account or profit and loss account etc
 is created
 aay-vyay kii sthiti ko samajhane ke liye ek aay-vyay khaataa banaaya jaataa he
 In this method, cash transactions are written in cash book and credit transactions are written in ledger
 yah pranali mukhyatah chote footkar vyapaariyon dwaara prayog kii jaati he
 In this way, keeping books only gives information about the condition of the cash of the merchant, that is, how much cash came and how much is left and how much is left
 kisko kitna dena he tathaa kisase kitna lenaa he, isaki jaankaree khaataa bahi se ho jaati he
 With this method it is not possible to create profit-loss account and economic letter unless this system is converted into a double accounting system
 isliye is pranali ko apurna pranali mana jaataa he
 It is considered the best system of bookkeeping
 is paddati main prayek vyavhaar ke donon roopon kaa lekha kiya jaataa he
 It is based on certain principles
 varsh ke ant main antim khate banaakar vyavsaay kii vaastavik sthiti kii jaankaree karnaa is paddati ke madhyam se aasaan hota he
 This is the prevalent method in India since time immemorial
 adhikansh bhartiya vyapaaree is pranali ke anusaar hi apana hisaab-kitaab rakhte hai
 It is also a completely scientific system based on certain principles
 is pranali ke aadhaar par bhi varsh ke ant main laabh-haani khaataa tathaa aarthik chittha banaaya jaataa he
 The main objective of financial accounting is to identify, measure, write, transmit financial information as well as record business transactions in the books of accounts in such a way that the operational results of the business for a fixed period can be known and on a fixed date
 Economic status has to be ascertained
 laagat lekhankan laagton ke lekhe karne kii ek aisi prakriya he jo aay va vyay, athwa un aadhaaron ke jin par unka pariklan kiya jaataa he, ke abhilekhan se armbh hoti he tathaa sankhyikeey samankon ke taiyaar hone ke saath hi samaapt ho jaati he
 This accounting method also considers current costs as well as future expenses
 prabandh lekhankan se taatpary lekhankan evam sankhyikeey pravidhiyon kii soochna ko prastut karne evam nirvachan karne ke vishisht uddeshy ke liye prayog se he
 It is designed to bring maximum efficiency to the information managers and to assist in the task of measuring their performance after considering, projecting and coordinating future plans
 agar hamen kisi upkram kii sthirataa, vikaas or laabhadaayakta sunishchit kerani ho to uski maanav sampatti se adhik mahatvapurn anya koi sampatti nahin he
 Its importance can be easily understood when other means of production such as capital, materials, torches, etc
 are all available and workers are not available
 itnaa hote hue bhi is mahatvapurn sampatti kaa lekhankan evam moolyankan aarthik chitthey main kisi bhi prakaar parilakshith nahin hota he
 As a result, the comparison of the economic results of the two firms on the basis of mere capital on appropriation etc
 is incomplete and sometimes misleading
 lekhankan main is kami ko dur karne ke liye maanav sansaadhan moolyankan evam lekhon main darj kar vittiya parinaamon main pradarshit karne kii ek nayi pranali viksit hui he jise maanav sansaadhan lekhankan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to the Human Accounting Accounting Committee of the American Accounting Association, "human resource accounting is the process of identifying human resources, measuring it in the form of data, and organizing this information to the relevant parties
 ’’ If we look at the long-term price situation of the past, one thing is universally clear that the value of every item in the world has generally increased
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad mulya suchakaankon main parivartan kii gati behad teevr hui
 This inflationary situation made the comparability of economic outcomes in the commercial world redundant
 mudra sfiti ke is dushprinaam kaa prabhaav shunya par vaastavik parinaamon kii jaankaree karne ke liye mudra sfiti mulya suchakankaan kii sahaayta se laabh-haani khate ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or isi prakaar se chitthey main sthaayee sampattiyon ke mulyon ko samyojit kiya jaataa he
 Final accounts are also prepared by revaluation
 vartmaan main is lekhankan kii do vidhiyaan-vartmaan laagat lekhankan tathaa vartmaan kray shakti lekhankan prachlan main he
 In the present few decades, the ideology of social responsibility has emerged in business
 badalte hue saamaajik mulyon or aashaaon ne samaaj main vyavsaay kii bhoomika ke bare main vichaar ko badhaaya he or yah vichaar vyavsaay ke saamaajik daayitv kii prakruti par kendrit ho gaya he
 It has been assumed that this liability can be met by social obligation accounting, a form of accounting
 chunki vyavsaay utpaadan ke saadhan sthaneey sroton se praapt karnaa he atah paryaavaran main uske kaaran anek hanikaarak parivartan hote hai
 Under social accounting, a business can show the extent to which it has carried out social responsibilities by creating a social profit-loss account and social letter
 lekhankan kaa mul uddeshy sanstha main hit rakhane vaale aantarik tathaa bahya pakshakaron ko aavashyak suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 But what information a party needs, it depends on the nature of interest in his business
 vibhinn pakshakaron kii drushti se aavashyak lekhankan soochna kaa vivechan is prakaar he- Owners arrange funds for the running of the business, hence they want to know that they have appropriated the funds provided by them
 us kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti jaanane ke liye lekhankan suchanaaen chaahate hai
 Such information is provided from time to time by financial statements prepared from accounting records
 duusare se kaary karwaane kii kala hi prabandh he
 Therefore, the management should ensure that its subordinate employees are doing proper work or not
 is sambandh main lekhankan suchanaaen bahut sahaayak hoti hai kyonki isse prabandhak karmchaariyon ke nishpaadan kaa moolyankan kar saktaa he
 Corrective action can be taken by comparing actual performance of employees with pre-determined standards, if actual performance is not of the desired level
 vastav main lekhankan suchanaaen hi prabandh kii vittiya niti, niyojan evam niyantran kaa aadhaar hoti hai
 Appropriators include potential shareholders and long-term lenders
 inkaa hit apane viniyog kii suraksha tathaa us par paryaapt aay praapt karnaa hota he
 They therefore require accounting information to evaluate the past performance of the institution and to explore future prospects, so the employers rely on accounting information included in the financial statements for their investment decisions
 ve jis sanstha main viniyog karnaa chaahate hai, lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par us sanstha kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 Creditors include sellers of goods, bankers and other lenders
 ye rin dene se purv sanstha kii vittiya sthiti jaananaa chaahate hai tathaa is baat se aashwast hona chaahate hai ki sanstha samay par rinon kaa bhugtan kar degi
 In other words, the liquid position of the institution is satisfactory
 sanstha kii taralata sthiti kii jaankaree ke liye inhen chaalu sampattiyon, taral sampattiyon tathaa chaalu dayitvon sambandhi lekhankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo inhen sanstha ke vittiya vivaranon se uplabdh hoti he
 Various government departments and agencies like Company Law Board, Registrar of Companies, Income Tax Department, Wing Market etc
 are also interested in financial information of companies
 in agensiyon kaa uddeshy yah aashwast karnaa hota he ki company ne apane lekhon main kar, labhaansh, hris aadi ke sambandh main adhinium kii vyavasthaaon kaa paalan kiya he athwa nahin tathaa apane laabhon evam vittiya sthiti ko sahi va sachche dhang se prastut kiya he athwa nahin
 The government determines the tax payable capacity of business entities on the basis of information received from the statement of accounts
 ye suchanaaen sarkaar kii bhavi kar niti, utpaadan, mulya niyantran, anudaan, license, aayaat-niryaat niti main di jane vaali suvidhaayen aadi kaa aadhaar hoti he
 The government also requires accounting information of business entities to determine national income
 kabhi kabhi sanstha ke utpaadon kaa mulya nirdhaarit karne ke liye bhi moolyankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki upabhoktaaon evam utpaadakon kaa shoshan na ho sake
 Employees are interested in the economic soundness of the institution as the payment of bonuses depends on the benefits earned
 iske atirikt niyoktaaon or shram sanghon ke bich samuhik saudebaaji lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par hi kii jaati he
 Accounting information, which is said to mirror the financial performance of a business institution, is very valuable to researchers
 ek kaary vishesh kii vittiya kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye shodhakartaaon ko kray, vikray, chaalu sampatti evam daayitv, sthaayee sampattiyaan, dirghakaalin daayitv, swaamiyon ke kosh aadi ke bare main vistrut lekhankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, aisi suchanaaen sanstha dwaara rakhe gayi lekhankan abhilekhon se hi praapt kii ja sakati hai
 Each transaction has two aspects or parties
 khaataa-bahi main prayek paksh kaa ek khaataa banaaya jaataa he
 An account is that part of an ledger in which a collective statement of transactions made in relation to a person, goods or services is written
 is prakaar prayek khate kii sthiti kaa pataa lag jaataa he ki vah khaataa lender he tathaa dendar 
 According to the dual system it is necessary to know the classification of accounts in order to write transactions in sources
 jin khaaton kaa sambandh kisi vishesh vyakti se hota he, ve vyaktigat khate kehalaate hai
 An individual means an individual, firm, company and any other type of business entity
 duusare shabdon main, sab lendaaron tathaa dendaaron ke khate vyaktigat khate hote hai
 From this point of view, the accounts of capital and withdrawal are also personal as these transactions related to the owner of the business are written
 vyapaar ke swami ke vyaktigat khate ko puunji khaataa kaha jaataa he
 Withdrawal account is opened by the business owner to withdraw money from the business
 is prakaar aaharan khaataa bhi vyaktigat khaataa hota he
 Accounts of goods and property are called real accounts
 in khaaton ko vaastavik isliye kaha jaataa he ki inamen varnit vasteen, vishesh sampatti ke rup main vyapaar main prayog kii jaati he
 The merchant can convert his capital into money by selling them when needed
 vaastavik khate aarthik chitthey main sampatti kii tarah dikhaaye jate hai
 Such as machines, buildings, goods, machinery, furniture, cash and banks etc
 are the actual accounts
 in khaaton ko avastavik khate bhi kehete hai
 Business consists of many expenditure items, income items and profit or loss items
 in sabake liye alag-alag khate banate hai jinako ‘nammaatr’ ke khate kehete hai
 They have no tangible basis like personal or real accounts
 udhaaharan ke liye vetan, mazdooree, kamishan, byaaj ityadi ke khate nammaatr ke khate hote hai
 Each transaction has two sides
 rini yaa debit paksh or dhani yaa credit paksh
 For this reason, each account has two parts to write its account
 baayen haath kii ore bhaag ‘rini paksh’ hota he or daahine haath kii ore kaa bhaag ‘dhani paksh’ hota he
 Debit or credit to accounts - When an account is a 'lane' party in a transaction, that is, it gets debited then the accounts are debited
 debit karne kaa matlab yah he ki khate ke rini bhaag main lenden kaa lekha hoga
 Similarly, when an account is a party to a transaction, that is, someone gains something from it, then that account is credited
 arthath us khate ke credit bhaag main lenden kaa lekha kiya jayega
 In this transaction one account and another account are credited in this way
 debit khate main debit kii ore lekha tathaa credit khate main credit kii ore lekha hota he
 Credit and debit accounting is done for every transaction according to double account system
 udhaaharan - yadi hamane mohan se 100 rupaye kaa maal kharida he to isamen do khate hue- ek maal kaa doosraa mohan kaa
 One account will be done in the account of the receiver ie goods account and the other account will be done in the account of the recipient ie Mohan
 isi kaaran is pranali ko dohare lekhe kii pranali kaha gaya he
 Each transaction has two accounts, a debit and a credit
