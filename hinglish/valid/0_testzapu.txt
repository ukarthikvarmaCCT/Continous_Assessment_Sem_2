 pehla film 'drimigirl' ke premier par, jahaan om or pappu chaalaaki se ghus jate hai
 Another on the set of the film where Om saves Shanti from fire by playing on her life

 She demands Mukesh his rights
 sab sunakar om kaa dil tut jaataa he
 One night, Mukesh takes Shanti to the set of the film 'om Shanti Om'
 vah kahata he ki vah film ko band kar degaa or saare samaaj ke saamne shanti se vivaah kar legaa
 But it turns out to be a trick of Mukesh
 vah shanti ko apni vittiya haani kaa kaaran samajhataa he
 So he sets the set on fire and leaves Shanti to die there

 Then Om and his assistant seek Shantipriya's lookalike

 And then their plan begins - Om plays games with Mukesh

 Om states that he was witness to the killing of Shanti by Mukesh in his previous birth
 mukesh use chunauti detaa he ki purvajanm kii baat par koi bhi adaalat vishwaas nahin karegi
 Just then, a young woman in the guise of peace comes there and says that just below the chandelier on the set, the proof of murder is buried - her body, which Mukesh had buried alive under the ground
 vah om ko mukesh par waar karne se roak detii he
 a heavy chandelier falls down and Mukesh gets subdued by it
 duusari ore se pappu ke saath sandy kamare main aa jaati he
 Om then realizes that Sandi, not the one who spoke the evidence, was the soul of the real Shantipriya, who avenged his killer

 'mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas' was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the field of science and engineering by the Government of India in 1977
 ye karnataka se hai
 Even though the Adivasis of Indian Sociology may not be formalized, they have enriched this discipline in independent India with their theoretical contributions, unique understanding of caste and the method of participatory observation that they have given to the top sociologists of the country
 Enough to include
 samajashaastra main unhen samskruthikaran, prabhutvshaalee jati or vot bank jaisi moulik prasthaapanaaon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Srinivas was also the creator of the institutions
 baroda or dilli vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke vibhaagon kii sthapana kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 His contribution to the development of Indian sociology will also be considered as classical in terms of establishing and guiding high-level institutions of research and study
 gramin samudaay or jati kii sanrachana ke vishisht adhyayan ke alaava em
en
 shrinivas ne vigyaan ke saamaajik prabhaav, gandhi ke dharmik chintan, maanavshaastra ke itihaas se lekar gender jaise vishyon par bhi vicharottejak kaam kiya he
 Srinivas's work is considered to be a rare confluence of objective supervision, fineness of analysis and theoretical depth
 unka lekhan antar-vishyaktaa ko ek khaas tarah kaa jamini sandarbh pradaan karata he
 Srinivas's sociological vision explores the external structure of events and fathoms the structures and historical forces that compose them
 saamudayik jivan ke baarik byoron or antardrushtiyon ko saral bhashaa main prastut karne kii unki kshamta unhen samakaleen samajashastriyon se ek alag vyaktitv pradaan karti he
 In this sense, they transcend the thematic vocabulary and choose the simple and popular language
 ise unki vidvatta kaa janawaad hi kaha jayega ki unki saidhantik avadharanaayen apane kutarthon main uljhane ke bajaay vishay ko samajhane main zyaada madad karti hai
 Srinivas created a new land for Indian sociology at the level of ideology
 ullekhneey he ki jis daur main shrinivas bhartiya samaaj ke adhyayan kii taiyaari kar rahe the us samay samaaj-vigyaanon par america or british academik prasthapanaayen haaavee thi
 The prevailing approach in American universities emphasized Sanskritic traditions to understand the society of the Indian subcontinent
 iske asar main bhartiya samajashastri samakaleen yatharth ke adhyayan ke liye sanskrit ke sroton or bharat- vidya / indolji ko zyaada pramanik maanate the
 Srinivas was the first sociologist to challenge this dominant position
 unhone apane lekhan se sabit kiya ki samajashaastra main samaaj ke vaastavik kaaryakalapon or gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan shastreey sandarbhon par nirbhar rahane se zyaada shreyaskar he
 The concepts of dominant caste and Sanskritisation presented by Srinivas have been widely used by historians of streams like subaltern of history-writing besides political scientists
 is arth main unke krititv ko ek bauddhik parampara kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo naye-puraane vidwaanon ke liye ek zaruri sandarbh kii haisiyat hasil kar chukaa he
 Incidentally, the concept of dominant caste reflects dominance in a particular village or region of a caste due to factors such as number force, land ownership, education and job, so Sanskritisation is the culture of upper castes especially Brahmin class by lower castes
 Indicates the tendency to adopt customs, language and costumes etc
 haalaanki unki teesri avadharana vot bank, samaaj-vigyaanon main sthai jagah nahin bana paayi parantu raajnneeti ke dainik vimarsh or media jagat main is pad kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In studying the political and social structure of independent India, all these three concepts and related discourse have acquired immediate significance
 prabhutvshaalee jati or samskruthikaran kii avadharanaayen bharat kii saamaajik vyavastha or uske santhnik dhaanche ke nirnaayak tattvon ko samajhane main madad karti hai
 Although the concept of Sanskritisation is no longer considered as important due to the decreasing legitimacy of Brahminical ideals, the fact remains that Sanskritisation was a fairly notable trend for a long period of the twentieth century and even after independence
 dalit andolan or mandal ayog ke baad ubhari raajnneeti main samskruthikaran kii pravriti ksheen hoti gayi he lekin prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana ko bharat ke gramin samaaj main chalane vaali raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa vishleshan karne main aaj bhi ek jaruri aujaar kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 Many contemporary sociologists have been urging to assess Srinivas's work in the larger context of nationalist sociology
 unka kahana he ki swatantra bharat kaa shahari abhijan aupniveshik shashan ke aadhunikeekaran kii pariyojna ko jari rakhana chahta tha
 Therefore, the same colonial arrays of thought and thought were active in the work of nationalist sociologists on the basis of which the British power had been legitimizing its rule
 in vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati or samudaay par kendrit shrinivas jaise samajashastriyon kaa krititv ek akhil bhartiya sanskritvaadi hindu dharm kii samaj ko peethika pradaan karata he
 But Srinivas's vision is a hasty plea to be overtly or indirectly guided by the foundations of British or American anthropology, which, despite the lack of evidence, dares to prepare charge sheets
 yah daleel shrinivas ke krititv kii us pravriti ko lakshith karne main chook karti he jisamen shrinivas samudaay kaa adhyayan karte hue samudaay or apane sambandhon ke dwait par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Srinivas considers the basic foundations of sociology and anthropology in a similar way
 gauratlab he ki shrinivas sahabhaagi adhyeta ke taur par khud ko ek aise adhyeta ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisaki iyatta apane vishay yani logon se alag nahin he
 Srinivas did not classify the people or community he studied
 is sambandh main kai british maanavshastri yah maanate rahe hai apane samaaj kaa adhyayan karne vaale maanavshastri ko alag tarah kii mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 According to him, the anthropologist of the developed country always wants to imprison an indigenous anthropologist in a particular mold by pointing to his inferior position
 shrinivas ne is masale par deshaj maanavshastri kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ki jab koi bhartiya maanavshastri bharat kii kisi jati yaa anya samooh kaa adhyayan karata he to vah jati yaa samooh uske liye anya bhi hota he lekin saath hi is baat ko darkinar nahin karnaa chahie ki us jati yaa samooh ke katipay saanskrithik rup, vishwaas or mulya ukt adhyeta se bhi mail khate hai
 That is, in such a situation the Indian anthropologist actually studies the self in one way or the other
 is myne main vah jati yaa samooh uske liye nitant aparichit yaa anya nahin rah jaataa kyonki donon ek hi samskruti se jude hote hai
 Srinivas considers this situation as unusually complex, multilayered and duplex
 dhyaan se dekhen to shrinivas apane vishay ke saath antar or samanta ke jin binduon baat karte hai unhen dekhte hue un par rashtravaadi samajashastri hone kaa aarope damdaar nahin lagata
 In fact, Srinivas stresses that this multiplicity of self and others in study is far better than the anthropologist's singularity of being a member or an outsider of his community
 yah gauratlab he ki apane shodh adhyayan ke liye shrinivas ne jis rampura gaanv ko chunaa tha uski jati vyavastha ke adhyayan main ve chicago skool ke kai prekshanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Srinivas proving the pre-british concept of varna as a bookish point of view, saying that this vision dwarfs the dynamic aspects of caste
 haalaanki shrinivas kaa jati-adhyayan ek gaanv kii sthaneey sanrachana par kendrit tha lekin vah is parighatna kii akhil bhartiya vyapti ko lekar bhi sachet the
 In one of his articles, he points to the fact that caste is undoubtedly an all-india structure, as groups can be seen everywhere in the country that form a distinct group based on paternal and marital relationships
 shrinivas is sambandh main in samoohon ke parmparik rojgaar kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 He also says that the existence of castes serving Brahmins, untouchables, farmers, artisans, merchants and others can be seen everywhere in the country

 In the long term, Srinivas, as a sociologist, has also freed the Indian village and caste structure from the theoretical dominance of colonial perceptions
 or saath hi dyumon jaise samajashastri kii manyataon kaa bhi pratwaad kiya jo yah pratipaadit kar rahe the ki jatigat vibhinnataayen bhartiya gaanv ko samudaay kaa rup nahin lene detii
 When Srinivas talks about the concept of rural community and the economic-cultural interdependence of villages, he also talks about All India Civilization in a latent manner
 kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki shrinivas ne jati ke adhyayan main brahmanvaadi yaa ucch jati kaa drushtikon apanaaya he
 But looking at this argument from the right angle, it seems to have originated from colonial sociology
 shrinivas kii tark-yojana vastav main pashchimi samajashastriyon kii bharat ke gramin samudaayon ke sambandh main pratipaadit sthool or alp-chintit dharanaon ko ujagar karti he

 The Second Sex is a book written in French by Simon the Bauer that has deeply influenced feminine perceptions and discourse
 stri adhikaaravaadi vichaardhaara vaali simon kii yah pustak nari astitvvaad ko prabhavi tareeke se prastut karti he
 It establishes that the woman does not take birth but is created as she grows in life
 unki yah vyakhya higel ke soch ko dhyaan main rakhkar “doosraa” kii sankalpana pradaan karti he
 According to her concept, a woman should have the right to live and work in her life according to her likes and dislikes and she can move from man to society
 aisa karke wo sthirataa se aage badhkar shreshthata kii ore apana jivan aage badha saktin hai
 By doing this, women are encouraged to move from the cycle of duty in their lives to move towards independent life
 doosraa ling ek iesai pustak he, jo europe ke saamaajik, rajnatik, va dharmik niyamo ko chunauti detii hai, jisane nari astitv evam nari pragati main hameshaa se baadha daali he or nari jaati ko purusho se neeche sthaan diya hai
 In this book, he has given his thoughts about the policy of not thinking on the goodness of the women who have been harassed by the frauds of the men
 iskaa hindi anuwaad stri upekshita naam se hua
 The Second Sex was originally written under the title Le Temps Modernes, which was published in June 1949
 is kitaab kaa doosraa bhaag pehle bhaag ke chhapane ke kuch mahino baad prakashit kii gayi thi
 Both parts were published in the US soon after by Howard Persley, translated into English
 howard par anuwaad karne kaa prastaav alfred nof kii patni, blaanch nof na rakhaa tha
 Since Howard understood very little of French and he had no interest in or understanding of philosophy, he had done the work of translation to a great extent
 ve smith college main jeev vigyaan padhaate the
 Many years later, in 2009, on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the original published French book, a second translated book of the two parts was published
 beovior ne apni vichaardhaara do alag auraton se pratyaashit kii thi, erika jong or german greer, jo striyon ke ahikaro par samarthan karti thim
 "woman: Myth or Truth" is a chapter where the writer Beauvoir describes how men have given woman the status of "second" in society
 ve kahati hai ki purush ne nari ke chaaro ore jhuthe niyam ore kaanoon banaakar unhen is aashwashan main rakhaa hai ki unki jagah purush shreshth hai
 The writer believed that by doing this, the men had lost their understanding of the problems of the women and their false frauds have helped them to keep the women bound under them in the society
 beovoir kaa maananaa hai ki aisa hi dabaav samaj ke dusre bhaago main bhi dekha gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye, samaaj main rang, jaati, evam dharman ko lekar kattar va choti soch vaale paakhandee logon ne kai jhagade va bhed-bhav felaaya he
 But they believe that as much as Sastri caste has been suppressed in the history of society, no religion and caste has been suppressed
 nari ko apane se neeche rakhkar paakhandee purushon na samaaj main apana ooncha sthaan banaaye rakhaa hai
 In his book Beauvoir has highlighted many such ideas, which challenge the rules or rules of society
 unhone kaha hai ki striyon ko kamazor evam shaareerik va maansik rup se asaamaanya mana gaya he or isi karanvash striyon ko kahi bhi uchit avasar nahin mila hai
 Women have always been assured that they are weak and they should follow the guidance of men to remain stable and normal
 da second sex ke prakashit hone se pehle nari astitvvaad ke vishay main france main kabhi koi bhi vichaar vimarsh nahin hue the or striyon ko kabhi bhi samaaj ke kanoonon se koi shikaayat nahin thim
 But Boar changed the mind
 unka nari va purusjh jaati kii samaaj main samanta do muddon kii taraf dhyaan khinchataa hai: ek, ki kis tarah shaareerik asaamanyata purushon ko nari se upar va badhkar hone kaa kaaran ban gayi hai
 The second is how debating and thinking about physical abnormalities shows that physical abnormality is actually an action of nature and men have no hand in it
 atah, shaareerik asaamanyata ko purusho ore nari main saamaajik asamaanyata karne kaa kaaran vyarth evam murkh hai
 Here Beauvoir denies Plato's idea that a person's gender is an event that does not insist on that person
 isliye, purusho or naario main koi bhed bhav nahin karnaa chahie
 Beauvoir has made many contributions to women's existence, but Beauvoir has never called herself a staunch feminist rightist
 parantu 1960 or 1970 ke stri adhikaaravaadi morcho ke baad 1972 main beovoir na apane aap ko ek stri adhikaaravaadi ghoshit kiya tha

 Accounting has been called the 'language of business'
 hindi main 'accountancy' ke samatuly 'lekhavidhi' tathaa 'lekhakarm' shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Accounting is the branch of mathematical science that is useful in finding the reasons for success and failure in business
 lekhashastra ke siddhant vyavasayik ikaayiyon par vyaavhaarik kala ke teen prabhaagon main lagu hote hai, jinke naam hai, lekhankan, bahi-khaataa, tathaa lekha pariksha 
 In the modern era, the form of economic activities of man has become very wide and versatile
 anek prakaar ke vyapaar va udyog-dhandhon tathaa vyavsaayon kaa janm ho rahaa he
 The purpose of industries and other business activities is to achieve profitability
 vyapaaree yaa udyogpati ke liye yah aavashyak hota he ki use vyapaar kii safalataa va asafalataa yaa laabh-haani va aarthik sthiti kaa gyaan hona chahie
 For this, he makes extensive use of manuals and accounting methods
 lekhankan-pustaken banaakar vyapaarik sansthaaon ko apni aarthik sthiti va laabh-haani kii jaankaree praapt hoti he
 Although bookkeeping and accounting are not compulsory for a businessman, but without this they cannot carry out their work successfully and they are not even aware of the profit or loss from their business activities
 lekhe rakhane kii kriya kisi na kisi rup main us samay se vidyaman he jab se vyavsaay kaa janm hua he
 a very small businessman can keep accounts in the brain by recourse to memorisation, another can provide written form on paper
 vyavasthit rup se lekha rakhaa jaye yaa avyavasthit rup se, yah lekhankan hi kahalaayegaa
 As the size of the business grew and the nature of the business became increasingly complex accounting began to take shape
 isamen tark vitark, kaaran prabhaav vishleshan ke aadhaar par pratipaadit thos niyamon evam siddhanton kii neenv padati gai evam saamaanya lekha-jokha ek kaalaantar main vrahat lekhashastra ke rup main hamaare saamne aayaa
 The size of modern business has grown so much that hundreds, thousands and thousands of business transactions take place in it
 in len denon ke byore ko yaad rakhkar vyavsaayik upkram kaa sanchaalan karnaa asambhav he
 Therefore, systematic records of these transactions are kept and their systematic knowledge and experimentation is called accounting
 lekhashastra ke vyaavhaarik rup ko lekhankan kah sakate hai
 According to the Bulletin, the accounting terminology of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, "accounting for behaviors and events that are at least partly financial in nature, effectively writing, classifying and summarizing money as a currency and the consequences thereof
" Is the art of explaining
 ’’ According to this definition accounting is an art, not a science
 is kala kaa upyog vittiya prakruti ke mudra main maapneey vyavhaaron or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan, vargeekaran, sankshepan or nirvachan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Smith and Ashburn have presented the above definition with some improvement
 unke anusaar ‘lekhankan mukhyatah vittiya prakruti ke vyavsaayik lendenon or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan tathaa vargeekaran kaa vigyaan he or un lendeene or ghatnaon kaa mahatvapurn saransh banane, vishleshan tathaa vyakhya karne or parinaamon ko un vyaktiyon ko sampreshit karne kii kala he, jinhen nirnay lene hai
 According to this definition, accounting is both science and art
 kintu yah ek purna nishchit vigyaan na hokar lagbhag purna vigyaan he
 The American Accounting Principles Board has defined accounting as a service action
 uske anusaar, ‘lekhankan ek seva kriya he
 Its function is to give consequential information of financial nature mainly about financial units which is useful in making economic decisions by rational selection in alternative behavioral actions
 ’ Based on the above considerations, accounting can be called the art of writing, presenting, interpreting and informing the transactions of the financial nature of the business in a definite, structured and well planned manner
 sarvapratham praarambhik lekhankan ke record pracheen babylon, asyria or sumeria ke khandhar main paae gaye, jo 7000 varshon se bhi pehle kii taarikh ke hai
 The people of the time relied on ancient accounting methods to record the growth of crops and cattle
 kyonki krishi or pashu paalan ke liye prakritik ritu hoti he, atah agar fasalon kii paidaavaar ho chuki ho yaa pashuon ne nae bachche paidaa kiye hon to hisaab-kitaab kar adhishesh ko nirdhaarit karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 Based on the above definitions of accounting, the following characteristics are clear - lekhankan ek kala or vigyaan donon he
 In the form of art, it helps to know the financial result
 isamen abhilikhit tathaa vargeekrut len-denon or ghatnaon kaa saransh taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 They are analyzed and interpreted
 vittiya samankon kaa vishleshan evam nirvachan lekhankan kii kala hi he jiske liye vishesh gyaan, anubhav or yogyata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Similarly, conveying the meaning of financial data to the internal and external aspects of a business and its changes in such a way that they can take wise decisions in relation to business, is the art of accounting
 vigyaan ke rup main yah ek vyavasthit gyaan shakha he
 It has definite rules for recording, categorizing and summarizing transactions and events
 in nishchit niyamon ke kaaran hi lekhon kaa krambaddh va vyavasthit rup se abhilekhan kiya jaataa he
 But it is not a 'completely definite' science, but an 'almost perfect science'
 lekhankan main mudra main maapan yogya vittiya prakruti kii ghatnaon or vyavhaaron kaa hi lekha kiya jaataa he
 Practices that are not financial in nature are not accounted for in books
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek sanstha ke paas samarpit va vishwasaneey karmchaariyon kii ek toli ho jo vyavsaay ke liye bahut upyogi he, kaa lekha vyavsaay kii pustakon main nahin kiya jaayegaa kyonki yah vittiya prakruti kii nahin he tathaa ise mudra main abhivyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Accounting is a service function according to the board's definition of accounting principles
 iskaa uddeshy vyavsaayik kriyaaon ke bare main parimanatmak vittiya suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 The final product of accounting, ie the financial statement, is useful to those who make decisions about alternative functions
 lekhankan swayan kisi dhan kaa srijan nahin karata he, yadhyapi yah iske upyogkartaaon ko upyogi soochna uplabdh karaata he jo inhen dhan ke srijan evam rakh rakhaav main sahaayak hota he
 The main objectives of accounting are as follows - prayek vyavsaayik len-dein ko pustakon main krambaddh tareeke se likhnaa va uchit hisaab rakhana lekhankan kaa pratham uddeshy he
 In the absence of accounting, there would be a lot of burden on human memory which in most cases would have been impossible to bear
 vidhivat abhilekhan se bhul va chal-kapaton ko dur karne main sahaayta milti he
 Accounting protects against improper and undesirable use of business assets
 aisa lekhankan dwaara prabandh ko nimna suchanaaen pradaan karne ke kaaran sambhav hota he - The above information helps the business owner to know that the funds of the business are not unnecessarily idle
 lekhankan avadhi ke ant main vyavsaay sanchaalan ke falswaroop utpann shuddh laabh athwa haani kaa nirdhaaran lekhankan kaa pramukh uddeshy he
 There is a difference between net profit or loss and some proceeds of certain duration and some expenses
 yadi aagmon kii raashi adhik he to shuddh laabh hoga tathaa vipareet paristhiti main shuddh haani
 It is an indicator of managerial skills and business progress
 yahi anshadhariyon main labhaansh vitaran kaa aadhaar hota he
 The information provided by the profit and loss account is not sufficient
 vyavsaayee apni vittiya sthiti bhi jaananaa chahta he
 This is accomplished by letter
 chittha ek vishesh tithi ko vyavsaay kii sampattiyon evam dayitvon kaa vivaran he
 It acts as a barometer in knowing the financial health of the business
 vivekpurna nirnay lene ke liye sambandhit adhikariyon evam sanstha main hit rakhane vaale vibhinn pakshakaron ko vaanchit soochna uplabdh karana, lekhankan kaa uddeshy he
 The American Accounting Association has also given special emphasis to this point while defining accounting
 unke anusaar, The first task of accounting is to systematically and methodically accounting all business deals and events in the journal
 yahaan yah dhyaan rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he ki lekhankan main unheen saudon evam ghatnaon kaa lekha kiya jaataa hai jo vittiya swabhaav kii hai tathaa jinhen mudra ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 After accounting for monetary transactions, they are classified according to their nature into separate groups on the basis of equality so that separate information can be available for different items separately
 udhaahrantaya samast bikri ke saudo ko, jo bhinn bhinn sthanon par likhe gayi hai, ek hi sthaan par ekatrit karnaa, taaki kul bikri kii raashi gyaat ho sake
 This is done by opening accounts in the ledger
 lekhankan kaa mukhya uddeshy nirnay lene waalon ke liye mahatvapurn soochna pradaan karnaa he
 For this work, at the end of the year, after finding the balances of all the accounts, a list is made from them and two details - profit and loss account and letter are prepared from that list
 in vivaranon se vyavsaay kii laabhadaayakta, vittiya sthiti, bhugtan kshamta aadi ke sambandh main mahatvapurn suchanaaen uplabdh ho jaati he
 In this way all the information of the year is summarized and merges into two details which shows the final results of the business
 lekhankan na keval lekha karne, vargeekaran karne evam sankshipteekaran karne kaa hi kaary karti he balki un aankadon kaa nirvachan karke nishkarsh evam upyogi suchnaaain bhi pradaan karti he
 For example, what was the rate of repatriation in the organization? How much did advertising impact sales growth? Information such as the status of liquidity and payment capacity are available
 lekhon ke vishleshan evam nirvachan se praapt soochnaaon kaa unke prayogkartaaon jaise viniojakon, lendaaron, sarkaar, swaamiyon aadi tathaa vyavsaay main hit rakhane vaale anya vyaktiyon ko sanvahan kiya jaataa he taaki ve vyavsaay kii vittiya sthiti ke sambandh main apni raay bana saken tathaa bhavi yojana ke sambandh main nirnay le sake
 The last task of accounting is to make such arrangements so that various statutory requirements can be met
 anek aise kanoon hai jinaki purti karnaa ek vyavsaayee ke dwaara anivaary he jaise iskar kii ritern prastut karnaa, bikrikar kii ritern prastut karnaa, sebi ke dwaara banaaye gayi niyamon kii paalna karnaa aadi
 Accounting helps in this task
 aadhunik vyapaarik kriyaaon ke safal sanchaalan ke liye lekhankan ko ek aavashyaktaa samajha jaataa he
 Why accounting is necessary can be explained by the following arguments - lekhankan kii anek pranaliyaan hai jinamein se nimnlikhit ullekhneey hai- 1

 An income-expenditure account is created to understand the state of income-expenditure
 is paddati main nakad len-denon ko rocked pustak main tathaa udhaar len denon ko khaataa bahi main likhaa jaataa he
 This system is mainly used by small retail traders
 is prakaar pustaken rakhane se keval yah jaankaree hoti he ki vyapaaree kii rokad kii sthiti kisi he, arthath kitni rokad aayi tathaa kitni gayi tathaa kitni shesh he
 How much to give to whom and from whom to take, the information becomes from the ledger
 is paddati se laabh-haani khaataa va aarthik chittha bananaa sambhav nahin hota jab tak ki is pranali ko doharaa lekha pranali main badal na diya jaay
 Hence this system is considered as incomplete system

 On the basis of this system, a profit-loss account and an economic letter are made at the end of the year

 If we have to ensure the stability, growth and profitability of an enterprise, then there is no other property more important than its human property
 isaki mahatta tab aasaani se samajhi ja sakati he jab utpaadan ke anya saadhan puunji, saamagree, mashaanen aadi sab uplabdh hai or shramik uplabdh na hon
 Notwithstanding this, the accounting and valuation of this important asset is not reflected in the economic letter in any way
 parinamswaroop do fermaa ke aarthik parinaam kii keval viniojit puunji par pratyaaya aadi ke aadhaar par tulana apurna evam kabhi kabhi to bhraamak hoti he
 To overcome this shortfall in accounting, a new system of human resource evaluation and reporting in accounts and displaying in financial results has developed which is known as HR accounting
