 Wushu which literally means "martial arts"
 yah do shabdon 武術:武 se bana he, jiskaa arth he "marshall" athwa "sainya"術, jiskaa paryaay "anushaasan", "kaushal" athwa "paddati" he
 The word wushu has also become synonymous with modern sport, which is associated with performing Chinese art with unarmed arms and weapons, which has been adapted and judged as a contemporary aesthetic criterion for scoring

 Ideas associated with Chinese martial arts changed with the development of Chinese society and over time it gained some philosophical underpinnings: a passage in Zhuangji, a Daoist formula related to the psychology and practice of martial arts
 The author of the name of Zhuangji is believed to have been born in the 4th century BC

 However, there are at least forty such sources between the 16th and 17th centuries, suggesting that Shaolin monks not only practiced martial arts, but martial practice had become such an integral part of the life of the Shaolin Monastery that The monks felt the need to create a new Buddhist science to justify it
 References to the practice of martial arts of Shaolin are found in various literary disciplines after Ming: Shaolin monks find mention in warrior memorials, martial arts manuals, military disciplines, historical writings, travelogues, stories, and poems

 At that time, some began to view martial arts as a means of increasing national pride and building a strong nation
 As a result, several training manuals were published, a training academy was created, two national examinations were conducted and demonstration teams traveled abroad, and several martial arts associations were established in China and among various Chinese communities abroad

 The end of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949 led to the rapid international spread of Chinese martial arts

 In figurative speeches, he encouraged the use of the word kuoshu instead of the colloquial word gongfu, so that Chinese martial arts could be more closely associated with national pride rather than personal achievement
 In 1958, the government established the all-china Wushu Association as an umbrella organization to regulate martial arts training
 The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports took the initiative to standardize most of the major arts
 During this time, a national Wushu system was established, incorporating standard forms, teaching courses and instructor gradation
 hai skool or vishvavidhyalay str par vushu kii shuruuaat kii gayi
 During the Reconstruction era, when communist ideology became more compromised with alternative approaches, the suppression of traditional teaching was relaxed
 1979 main, shaareerik samskruti or khel ke chini rajya ayog ne vushu ke shikshan or abhyaas ke punarmoolyankan ke liye ek vishesh kaary bal banaaya

 As a result of these social factors changing within China, both traditional and modern Wushu styles are being developed by the Chinese government
 chini marshall art ab chini samskruti kaa ek abhinn ang ban gaya he
 China has a long history in the martial tradition, which includes hundreds of different styles
 pichley do hajaar saal main kai vishisht style viksit kii gayin or prayek kaa apni takneekon or vichaaron kaa samucchy he
 There are also common themes of various genres, often classified by "families", "denominations" or "schools"
 ansi bhi sheliyaan hai jo pashuon kii gatividhiyon kii nakal karti hai or kuch sheliyaan vibhinn chini darshanon, mithkon or kinvadantiyon se prerana leti hai
 Some styles focus most of their attention on the key, while others focus on competition
 chini marshall art main fark karne ke liye unhen vibhinn shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: masalan, bahari or aantarik 
 china ke kis bhaag main shaileyon kaa udbhav hua, us sthaan yaa avasthiti ke aadhaar par bhi chini marshall art ko vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he, jaise ki uttari or dakshini 
 yangtaze nadi yah vibhaajan karti he
 Chinese martial arts can also be classified according to their province or city
 uttari or dakshini shaileyon ke bich mukhya antar yah he ki uttari sheliyaan tej or shaktishaalee kicks, oonchi kud or aam taur par asthir tathaa twarit gati par jor diya karti hai, jabaki dakshini sheliyaan majboot bhujaa or haath kii takneekon, tathaa sthir, drudh mudra or tej footwork par adhik dhyaan detii hai
 Examples of northern styles include Changkuan and Singyikuan
 dakshini shaileyon main bak mei, choy lee foot or wing chun shaamil hai
 Chinese martial arts can also be divided according to religion, imitative styles, and family styles such as Huang Gar
 vargeekaran ke prakaar par dhyaan die bina chini marshall art ke vibhinn samoohon ke bich prashikshan main vishisht antar hai
 However, only a few experienced martial artists make a clear distinction between internal and external styles, or are able to accept the idea of northern methods being predominantly kick-based and southern systems more dependent on the upper body
 apane aantarik namavali ke baavjood adhikansh shaileyon main hard or soft donon tatv hua karte hai
 Analyzing the difference based on yin and yang theories, philosophers asserted that the absence of one would make the trainee's skills imbalanced or flawed, as both yin and yang are half of the whole in themselves
 agar is tarah ke antar ek baar astitv main aaye, tabase ve dhundhale ho gaye
 The training of Chinese martial arts includes the following components: basic elements, types, uses and weapons; Different styles emphasize each component differently
 iske alaava, chini marshall art dwaara darshan, naitikta or yahaan tak ki chikitsa paddati kaa bhi bahut sammaan kiya jaataa he
 a complete training system should also provide complete knowledge about Chinese trends and culture
 mul tatv kisi bhi marshall prashikshan ke liye ek mahatvapurn hissaa hai, kyonki unke bina koi vidhyaarthee adhik unnat charnon kii ore pragati nahin kar saktaa
 mul tatv aam taur par praathmik takneekon, mudraon sahit {1anukulan vyaayaamon{ / 1} se bane hote hai
 Basic training may consist of simple activities that have to be repeated over and over; Other examples of basic training are stretching, meditation, striking, throwing, or jumping
 Without strong and flexible muscles, key or breath management, and appropriate body mechanics, it is impossible for a student to progress in Chinese martial arts
 chini marshall art ke praathmik prashikshan ke bare main ek aam kahawat nimnlikhit he: Which can be translated as: External training includes the hands, the eyes, the body and stances
internal training includes the heart, the spirit, the mind, breathing and strength
 Structural postures employed in Chinese martial arts training are postures
 ve neenv or ek ladaaku ke aadhaarik sanrachana ke atiranjit rup kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 Each style has different names and variations for each pose
 pair kii sthiti, vajan kaa vibhaajan, sharir sanrekhan, aadi dwaara mudraon main bhed kiya ja saktaa he
 Posture training can be practiced statically, aiming to maintain the texture of the pose over a set time period, or dynamically, in which a series of actions are repeated over and over
 ghudsawaari mudra or dhanush mudra jaisi mudraon kii misaalen chini marshall art kii anek shaileyon main paayi jaati hai
 In many Chinese martial arts, meditation is considered an important component of primary training
 dhyaan kendrit karne main, dimagi spashtataa ke liye or kigong prashikshan ke liye ek aadhaar ke rup main kaary kar sakane main dhyaan kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Many Chinese martial arts have the idea of ki or chi
 kii ko naanaa prakaar se ek aantarik urja yaa "jivan shakti" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, jo praaniyon main jaan daal dene ke rup main janaa jaataa he; yaa sahi haddiyon ke dhanchaagat sanrekhan or mansapeshiyon ke prabhavi prayog ke liye is shabd kaa prayog hota he; yaa phir marshall art kaa vidhyaarthee philhal puri tarah samaj paane ko taiyaar nahin he, is vichaar kii ashulipi ke rup main ise paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 There is no need for these meanings to be mutually exclusive
 quigong ke naam se vikhyath vibhinn shaareerik or maansik vyaayaamon ke niyamit abhyaas se vyakti apni kii main sudhaar or majbootee laa saktaa he
 Although qigong is not a martial art by itself, it is often incorporated into Chinese martial arts and, thus, is practiced as an integral part of strengthening internal abilities
 kisi kii kii urja ko niyantrit karne ko lekar bahut saare vichaar hai, jaise ki iskaa istemaal apane athwa kisi kaa upachaar karne main kiya ja saktaa he: chikitsa kigong kaa lakshya he
 Some styles focus the key at a point when attacking and believe in targeting specific areas of the human body
 aisi takanic dim mark ke rup main jaani jaati he or iske siddhant acupressure se milte-julate hai
 Most Chinese styles offer training in a wide arsenal of Chinese weapons for body adaptation and coordination and strategic exercise
 buniyadi, vidhiyon or prashikshan anuprayogon main vidhyaarthee ke praveen ho jane ke baad aam taur par hathiyaar prashikshan diya jaataa he
 The basic principle of weapon training is to consider the weapon as an extension of the body
 mul tatv kii hi tarah isamen bhi usee tarah ke footwork or sharir samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The process of weapon training proceeds with methods, methods with pairing and then applications
 adhikansh shaileyon main paddati ke liye khaas visheshikrut upkarnon sahit vushu ke atharah shastronmen se prayek ke apane prashikshan tareeke hote hai
 The application refers to the active use of martial techniques
 chini marshall art takanic adarshagat rup se dakshata or prabhaavashiltaa par aadhaarit hai
 Many internal martial arts involve inexplicable drill applications such as pushing hands and also include boxing practice within various contact stars and rule sets
 kab or kaise anuprayog sikhaaye jate hai, yah shaileyon ke hisaab se badalata rahata he
 Today, many genres have begun to teach to focus on exercises, in which each student knows to practice war and technique within a defined range; These exercises are semi-ductile, meaning that a student does not actively use his technique in his demonstrative resistance to clean performance
 adhik sajiv abhyaason main, kam niyam lagu hote hai or vidhyaarthee kis tarah pratikriya karen or pratyuttar den, iskaa abhyaas kiya jaataa he
 The 'practice of boxing' application refers to the most important aspect of training, which creates a war-like situation by incorporating rules and regulations to reduce the chances of seriously injuring students
 chini marshall art kii mukkebaaji pratiyogitaaon main lei tai or sanda yaa sanchau kii paramparaayen shaamil hai
 Leitai, represented for the first time in the Song Dynasty, represents public competitions
 un spardhaon kaa uddeshy tha apane pratidwandvi ko kisi bhi aavashyak upaay se oonche manch se baahar phenk dena
 sanchau or sanda lei tai pratiyogita ke aadhunik vikaas kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, lekin gambhir chot kii ashanka ko kam karne ke liye niyam banaaye gaye hai
 Many Chinese martial arts schools teach or work under the rules of Sanshou and Sanda; It is under this that they mix activities, characteristics and theory of their own style
 chini marshall kalakaar mukkebaaji, kickboxing or mishrit marshall art sahit gaiyr-chini yaa mishrit yuddh khel pratispardhaon main bhi bhaag lete hai
 Methods or Chinese in Taolu Chinese: 套路; Pinyin: tào lù are a series of predefined joint activities or movements, so they can be practiced in a linear set of activities
 vidhiyaan multah ek vishesh style shakha ke vansh kii raksha karne ke liye hua karti thim or kala ke vansh kii raksha karne ke liye aksar unnat chaatro ko sikhaayi jaatin thim
 The methods are constructed in such a way that they incorporate literally, both representative and practiced forms of application technique; Through debate sessions, students whose abstracts can be extracted, tested and trained
 aaj, anek log vidhiyon ko chini marshall art ke mahatvapurn abhyaason main ek maanate hai
 Traditionally, he played a small role in combat application training and was eclipsed by debates, exercises and adaptations
 vidhiyaan kalakaar ke lacheelepan, aantarik tathaa bahya shakti, gati or sahanshakti kaa dhire-dhire nirmaan karti hai or santulan tathaa samanvay sikhaati hai
 Many styles include methods of using a wide range of weapons of different lengths and types with one or both hands
 aisi bhi sheliyaan hai jo ek nishchit prakaar ke hathiyaar par dhyaan kendrit karti hai
 The methods are both practical, useful and usable, as well as promoting the flow of attention, focus, flexibility, balance, and coordination
 shikshak aksar kehete hai "apane tareeke yaa vidhi ko saadho, jaise ki tum mukkebaaji karte ho usee tarah ek mukkebaaz kii tarah tareeke ko bhi dekho
" There are two common types of methods in Chinese martial arts
 sabase aam hai "ekal rup", jo ek akele chaatr dwaara kiye jate hai
 In addition there are forms of "boxing exercises", which are demonstrated by the holding of combat sets by two or more people
 mukkebaaji ke abhyaas kii vidhi is prakaar se banaayi gayi he ki nae yoddhaon ko iske buniyadi upayon tathaa yuddh kii avadharana se avgat karaayaa jaay or skool ke liye pradarshan abhyaason ke kaam bhi aa sake
 jo hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karte hai, ladaai ke wo rup vidhyaarthiyon ko hathiyaar chalaane ke liye jaruri vistaar, duuri or takanic ke shikshan ke liye vishesh rup se upyogi hote hai
 Chinese martial arts methods reflect realistic martial techniques, but despite how these techniques will be applied in warfare, the activities are not always identical
 Several methods have been described above, on the one hand to provide better combat preparedness and on the other hand more attention has been given to aesthetically
 nichali mudra or ucch, streacing kicks kaa upyog, vistaar kii ore is pravriti kii ek abhivyakti he jo yuddh anuprayog ke pare chali jaati he
 These two devices are unrealistic in warfare and are used in methods for practice purposes
 kai aadhunik skulon ne vyaavhaarik pratirodh yaa akraman gatividhiyon ke badale kalabaji kartabon ko sthaan de diya he, jo dekhne main adhik chamatkaarik lagate hai, isiilie pradarshaniyon or pratiyogitaaon ke dauraan inhen protsaahan miltaa he
 Traditionalists criticized the approval of more acrobatics in this pageant-specific Wushu contest
 Although appearance and appearance have always been important in many traditional forms, all forms exist because of their combat functionality
 aitihaasik rup se, aadhunik vushu ke aagaman se bahut pehle aksar manoranjan prayojanon ke liye vidhiyon kaa pradarshan kiya jaataa rahaa he; anupoorak aay ke liye kalakaar sadakon yaa theatron main pradarshan kiya karte
 yuan rajvansh ke dauraan puri tarah se pradarshan ke liye taiyaar kii gayi vidhiyaan pehali baar dikhaai deen
 Many traditional Chinese martial artists and modern sports professionals are critical of the idea that the work of methods is more relevant to art, not boxing and practice applications; While most continue to see the practice of traditional forms in the traditional context — both for proper combat execution, it is important to maintain the meditative work of Shaolin artistry and body art style as an art form
 mukkebaaji anuprayogon se takanic kii tulana karne par yah aksar alag-alag roopon main dikhaai detaa hai, kuch logon ko iskaa ek kaaran yah laga ki bahari logon se takneekon ke asli kaaryon ko chhipaane ke kaaran aisa hota he
 As their forms have evolved over the years amidst complexities and many of its forms can be practiced for a lifetime, this is why the styles of Chinese martial arts have been developed in such a way that they are fully concentrated in their forms And the application is not practiced at all
 The primary goal of these styles is performance and competition, and often includes aerobics jumps and activities to increase the visual impact compared to traditional styles
 aamtaur par jo paramparaagat style kaa abhyaas karte hai ve dikhaave par dhyaan kam dete hai or ve paramparawaadi kehalaate hai

 Moral is what results from the predominance of the determination of power, immorality is the manifest form of weakness

 In 1969, Shri Nandkishore Yadav joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 varsh 1969 main unke jivan main ek nayaa mode aayaa
 In the same year, he passed the matriculation examination
 yahi vah varsh tha jab unki jindagi hameshaa ke liye badalane vaali thi
 In the words of Mr
 Yadav Ji, “I used to go to the courtyard of the Khajekalan Shiva temple to study intermediate mathematics with my friends
 vahiin ek baar unke ek mitra, kumaar dinesh ne ek geet sunaayi- "why the pride of our pride, the brave of the country, forgot it, upadesh diya jo gita kaa kyon sunanaa, sunaanaa bhul gayi
 " poochne par kumaar dinesh ne is sambandh main bataaya ki ukt geet ve log rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii shakha main gaate hai
 Hearing this, Mr
 Yadav's eagerness to know more about the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh grew
 agle hi din apane mitra ke saath ve aar0es0es0 kii najdiki shakha main gayi or usee din aar0es0es0 se jud gayi
 As a young student leader, a dedicated volunteer for the RSS, his identity deepened due to his constant struggle over the problems of the students
 unki kaarykushalta or lokapriyata unhen chaatr raajnneeti main oonchaiyon tak le gayi
 In 1971, he joined the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad

 Today, when the development of Bihar is discussed, the development of roads comes first, whose credit goes to Shri Nand Kishore Yadav
 nitish kumaar ke bhaajapa se alag hone ke baad san 2013 main shri yadav ko bihar vidhaan sabha main netaa pratipaksh kii jimmevary mili
 His speech in the Legislative Assembly as the Leader of the Opposition became so popular that it had to be published in booklet and distributed among thousands of people
 san 2015 main aap bihar vidhaan sabha kii lok lekha samiti ke sabhapati bhi bane
 The biggest secret of his successful political life so far, his amazing organizational ability and deep tolerance is not to be discriminated against even to those who think
 othon par muskaan or manovinod ke swar se apane se kanishton ke prati sadbhaav unke swabhaav kii khaasiyat he
 As a result of political activism, whether the organization belongs to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad or the Bharatiya Janata Party organization or in the state government, till 1971, Nand Kishore Yadav has not been without any responsibility
 ek laudspikar ek vidyut-dhvanik urja parivartitra he, jo vaidyut sanketon ko dhwani main parivartit karata he
 The speaker moves according to changes in electrical signals and transmits sound waves through air or water

 The term "loudspeaker" may refer to an energy changer alone or to an entire enclosed speaker system with one or more drivers
 Most loudspeaker systems use more than one driver to adequately reproduce a wide range of frequencies, especially for higher sound pressure levels and maximum accuracy
 bhinn aavriti shrinkhalaaon ke punarutpaadan ke liye alag-alag driveron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The drivers are named subwoofers, woofers, medium-range speakers, tweeters, and sometimes supertweeters, optimized for the highest audio frequencies
 vibhinn spikar driveron ke liye shabdaawalee anuprayog ke aadhaar par parivartit hoti he
 Two-way systems do not have mid-range drivers, so the reproduction of mid-range sounds is done by woofer and tweeter
 home sterio main ucch aavriti driver ke liye "twitor" naam kaa istemaal hota he, jabaki peshewar sangeet system main unako echef yaa hai kaha jaataa he
 When more than one driver is used in a system, a "filter network" called a crossover separates the incoming signals into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver
 en pruthak aavriti band vaale laudspikar system ko “en -ve spikar” kaha jaataa haih ek tu-ve system main ek vufar or ek twitor hota he tathaa ek thri-ve system main ek vufar, ek madhya-shrinkhalaa tathaa ek twitor hota he
 Johann Philippe Rees installed an electric loudspeaker in his telephone in 1861 that was capable of reproducing pure melodies but could also reproduce speech
 elexander graham bel ne 1876 main apane telephone ke bhaag ke rup main pehle vidyut laudspikar ko patent karavaaya tha, jiskaa 1877 main anusaran kiya arnst cemens ke sanwarddhit sanskaran ne

 At the same time, Thomas Edison was issued a British patent for his initial cylinder phonograph using a system of compressed air as an augmentation mechanism, but he eventually gave his familiar, membrane-driven metal hub to the needle with a needle Only adopted
 In 1898, Horace Short patented a compressed air-powered loudspeaker, the rights of which he sold to Charles Parsons, who had been issued several additional British patents before 1910
 victor talking mashin tathaa pathe sahit kuch companiyon ne sampeedit-vaayu laudspikaron kaa prayog karte hue record players kaa utpaadan kiya
 However, these designs were limited due to poor sound quality and inability to reproduce sound at low intensity

 Electromagnets were used in these early loudspeakers, as large and permanent magnets were not commonly available at a reasonable cost
 ek vidyutchumbak kii kundali, jise kshetreey kundali kaha jaataa tha, driver ke saath sambandh jodne vaale duusare yugma main pravaahit vidyut dhara se sakriy hote the
 This coil typically played a dual role, acting as a coil choke to filter the power supply of the amplifier connected to the loudspeaker

 In the 1930s, loudspeaker manufacturers began combining two and three bandpasses of driver importance to increase frequency responses and sound pressure levels
 1937 main, pehla film udyog kaa maanak laudspikar system, "theatres ke liye shorer horn system", metro-goldvin-mir dwaara shuru kiya gaya tha
 It consists of a single multi-cellular horn with four 15-frequency low-frequency drivers, a crossover network set to 375 Hz, and two compression drivers to provide higher frequencies
 jon kenneth helliard, james bulo lencing or duglas shorer sabhi ne is system ke nirmaan main bhoomika nibhaai thi
 At the 1939 New York World's Fair, a towering two-sided public address system was installed at a tower in Flushing Meadows
 sinaudagraph ke liye mukhya abhiyantaa kii bhoomika main rudi bojaa ne aath 27” kam-aavriti driver dizin kiye the
 High-frequency drivers were probably made by Western Electric

 The most common type of driver is a light diaphragm or cone
 a rigid basket or frame is attached to a flexible suspension by which a coil of fine wire moves axially in a cylindrical magnetic field
 jab ek vidyut sanket wais kundali main bheja jaataa he, to wais kundali main vidyut dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he, jo ise ek chal vidyut chumbak bana detaa he
 The interaction between the coil and the driver's magnetic system produces a mechanical force that causes the coil to move back and forth, resulting in the reproduction of the sound under the control of the electrical signal from the amplifier
 laudspikar ke is prakaar ke vyaktigat ghatakon kaa varnan nimnlikhit prakaar he
 The diaphragm is usually produced in a conical or domed configuration
 vividh prakaar kii saamagree kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, lekin sabase aam, kaagaj, plastic or dhaatu hai
 The ideal material for this is one that is 1) rigid, to prevent uncontrolled motion of the cone; 2) Reduce weight, so that the minimum initial force requirement and energy storage issues are minimized, 3) well deformed, so that the signal does not continue to vibrate due to the resonance frequency set by its use and audible echo Don't be In practice, the use of current material cannot fulfill all three criteria simultaneously; Hence there are dilemmas in the design of the driver
 udhaaharan ke liye, kaagaj prakaash or aamtaur par acchhee tarah avmandit he, lekin kathor nahin he, dhaatu kathor or halki ho sakati he, lekin yah aamtaur par avmandit nahin hoti he, plastic halkaa ho saktaa he lekin aamtaur par, ise jitna kathor banaaya jayega utana hi iskaa avamandan kam hota jayega
 natijatan, kai shanku ke kai prakaar kii mili-juli saamagree ke bane hote hai
 For example, a cone can be made of cellulose paper, to which some carbon fiber, Kevlar, fiberglass, flax or bamboo fibers are added, or it can be used with porous layers, or additional a layer may be applied over it to provide hardness or damping
 chumbak antaraal ke saath mahatvapurn sangati main vikruti ke kaaran iske chumbak antaraal main wais kundal ke deevaaron se takaraane ko taalane ke liye chasis, frem yaa tokari ko kadaa dizin kiya jaataa he
 Chassis are typically cast in aluminum alloys or stamped in thin steel sheets, although molded plastic or deformed plastic composite baskets are popular, especially for cheap and lightweight drivers
 dhaatu ke chasis wais kundal se ooshmaa ko baahar pahunchane main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai; sanchaalan ke dauraan garm hone se pratirodh parivartit ho jaataa he, jiske kaaran bhautik aakaar parivartit ho saktaa he or yadi bahut zyada garm hone par sthai chumbak kaa chumbakatv nasht kar saktaa he
 The suspension system places the coil in the middle of the gap and provides the recirculation force needed to bring the cone back to normal after speed
 aam taur par ek nilamban pranali ke do hisse hote hai: "makadi", jo diaphram yaa wais kundal ko frem se jodatii he tathaa punarprachlan bal evam "gheraa" banaati he jo kundal / shanku sangyojan ko kendrit karne main sahaayta pradaan karata he or chumbak antaraal ke saath anukulit adhikansh piston-gati pradaan karata he
 Spiders are usually made of wavy cloth discs filled with a hardening resin
 yah shabd praarambhik nilambanon ke aakaar, jisamen chah se aath mudi hui "taangon" se jude bakelite saamagree se bane do sankendrit challe the, se liya gaya he
 Transformations of this structure included the addition of a swatch of namde to block particles so that they do not cause the voice coil to rub
 The German firm Rulik still offers unusual maneuvers with spiders made of wood
 shanku ke chaaron ore kaa gheraa rabad yaa polister fom yaa racin lepit kapade kii lahardaar challa ho saktaa he; yah donon bahari diaphram paridhiyon tathaa frem se judaa hota he
 These diverse enclosure materials, their size and treatment can dramatically affect the acoustic output of the driver; There are advantages and disadvantages to each category and implementation
 udhaaharan ke liye, poliester fom halkaa or kifayati he, lekin ozon, parabangnee prakaash, ardrata tathaa ucch taapmaana ke sampark main iskaa apchayan hota he, jisase iskaa upayoga jivan lagbhag 15 varsh tak samit ho jaataa he
 Voice coil typically uses copper wire, although aluminum — and very rarely, silver — is also used
 chumbakeey antaraal shretra main taar kii parivartansheel maatra pradaan karte hue, wais kundal ke taar kii anuprastha kaat, vrittakar, ytaakar yaa shatkoniya ho sakati he
 The coil is coaxially oriented inside the gap, it moves back and forth in a small circular space in the magnetic structure
 antaraal ek sthaayee chumbak ke do dhruvon, pehla antaraal kaa bahari hissaa or doosraa kendriya post ke bich ek kendrit chumbakeey kshetra sthapit karata he
 The pole piece and backplate are often a single piece called a poleplate or yoke
 aadhunik driver chumbak lagbhag hameshaa sthaayee hote hai or chini mitti, pherite, elkino yaa adhik haal main, durlabh mrudaa jaise niodymium or samarium cobalt ke bane hote hai
 Due to the increase in transportation costs and the desire for smaller, lighter equipment, the design has a tendency to use the final type than the heavy ferrite type
 bahut kam nirmaataa abhi bhi vidyut chaalit kshetreey kundaliyon kaa upyog karte hai 
 jab ucch kshetra-tivrata vaale sthai chumbak uplabdh hue, to kshetra-kundal driveron kii vidyut aapurti sambandhi samasyaon ko khatm karne ke kaaran aluminium, nikal tathaa cobalt kii ek mishradhatu, alnico lokapriy ho gai
 Alnico continued to be used almost exclusively until the 1980s
 Especially when used with high power amplifiers, alnico magnets can be partially distorted by accidental 'pops' and 'clicks' caused by loose combinations
 This loss can be reversed by magnetization
 1980 ke baad, adhiktar driver nirmaataa alnico ke sthaan par chini mitti tathaa barium yaa stronsium pherite ke maheen kanon ke mishran se bane pherite chumbak kaa upyog karne lage
 haalanki in chini mitti ke magnet kii prati kilogram urja alnico se kam he, ye kam kharchile hai tathaa nirmaataaon ke liye di hui kaaryakshmata hasil karne ke liye bade kintu kifayati chumbak bananaa sambhav ho jaataa he
 Depending on the design goals, the size and type of magnet and the details of the magnetic circuit vary
 udhaaharan ke liye, dhruviya khand kaa aakaar vaak kundali tathaa chumbakeey kshetra ke bich chumbakeey anyonyakriya ko prabhavit karata he or kabhi-kabhi ek driver ke vyavhaar ko sanshodhit karne ke liye iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a "miniature ring" or Faraday loop may be included in the form of a copper cap fitted to the pole or a heavy ring located inside the magneto-pole cavity
 is jatilta ke laabh ucch aavritiyon par pratibaadha kam hona, vistaarit ucch swar nirgam, hormonic virupan kam hona or aamtaur par bade vaak kundali bhraman se jude prerakatv modulan main kami hona shaamil hai
 On the other hand, the copper cap with increased magnetic resonance requires a wider speech interval, reduces available carry and requires a larger magnet for equivalent performance
 jis prakaar ek spikar system banane ke liye do yaa do se adhik driver ek antahkshetra main sanyojit hote hai,use shaamil karte hue, driver dizin kala tathaa vigyaan donon he
 Some combinations of magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and materials science theory are typically used to improve performance, with observations from experienced listeners and high precision measurements

 To ensure that the speaker can be measured free of room effects, designers can use non-resonant chambers, or use any of several electronic techniques that can replace such chambers to a limit
 kuch developers vaastavik-jivan kii shravan sthitiyon ke anukaran ke uddeshy se sthapit vishisht manakikrut kamare ke paksh main apratidhwanik kakshon kaa tyaag kar dete hai
 The construction of finished speaker systems is split, depending largely on prices, transportation costs, and weight ranges
 sthaneey kshetron se baahar kifayati parivahan ke anukool aakaar se aam taur par bade or baari ucch-ant spikar system saamanytah unke lakshith bazaar kshetron main hi banaae jate hai or unki laagat $140,000 yaa adhikprati jodi ho sakati he
 The lowest-priced speaker systems and most drivers are produced in China or other low-cost production sites
 alag-alag vidyutgatikeey driver ek simit pich seemaa ke andar ishtatam pradarshan karte hai
 Multiple drivers typically perform beyond that range by combining them across an entire loudspeaker system
 ek purna-seemaa driver ko yathasambhav vyapak aavriti anukriya ke liye dizin kiya jaataa he
 These drivers are small, typically 3 to 8 inches in diameter, designed to provide reasonably high frequency response and carefully designed for low-distortion output at low frequencies, although their maximum output level is reduced
 purna-seemaa driver sarvaadhik aam rup se jan udghoshnaa systamon par, televijan par, chote radio, intercom, kuch computer spikaron main sune jate hai
 In hi-fi speaker systems, the use of wide range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers due to incompatible driver conditions or transition network issues
 vyapak-seemaa driver hai-faai systamon ke prashansakon ke daawey ke anusaar dhwani kii sansaktata, ekal strot tathaa vyatikaran ke abhaav ke kaaran he or sambhawatah sankraman ghatakon kii anupasthiti ke kaaran bhi he
 Opponents typically require large, wide, expensive enclosures — such as transmission lines or horns — to reach their optimal performance, along with limited-frequency response and minor output capabilities of wide-range drivers
 purna-seemaa driveron main aksar vijar naamak ek atirikt shanku lagaaya jaataa he, jo ek chota, halkaa vaak kundali tathaa praathmik shanku ke bich jod se judaa hota he
 The whizzer cone provides the driver's high frequency response and extends its high frequency directivity, otherwise it becomes extremely narrower due to the external diameter cone material not able to keep in sync with the central speech coil at high frequencies
 mukhya shanku kaa vijar dizin main is prakaar nirmaan kiya jaataa he ki vah centre kii apeksha bahari vyas main adhik muda ho
 nateeja yah hota he ki mukhya shanku kam aavritiyaan vitarit karata he vijar shanku adhiktar ucch aavritiyon main yogadan detaa he
 Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, the output immersion at higher frequencies is better relative to a single large diaphragm
 simit-duuri ke driveron kaa istemaal bhi akele, aamtaur par computer, khilone or ghadi radio main kiya jaataa he
 These drivers are less elaborate and less expensive than wide-range drivers, and they will have to make many compromises in order to fit into very small spaces
 In these applications, sound quality has a lower priority
 maanav kaan dhwani kii kharaab gunvattta ke prati ullekhneey rup se sahansheel hote hai or simit-duuri driveron main antarnihit virupan, boli gai sabd saamagree kii spashtataa ko badhaate hue ucch aavritiyon par unke nirgam ko badha saktaa he
 a subwoofer is the lowest part of the audio spectrum, typically below 200 Hz for consumer systems, below 100 Hz for professional vibrant sound, and below 20 Hz in THX approved systems
 chunki aavritiyon kii lakshith seemaa simit he, sabavufar system kaa dizin aamtaur par paaramparik laudspikaron kii tulana main kai myanon main saral hota he, aksar ekal driver ek upyukt box yaa antarvesh main arohit
 In order to accurately reproduce very low sounding tones without unwanted resonances, the subwoofer system must be solidified and properly tightened; Good speakers are usually quite heavy
 kai sabavufar systamon main vidyut pravardhak or nimna-aavriti punarutpaadan sambandhi atirikt niyantranon ke saath electronic sab-filter shaamil hote hai
 These adaptations are known as "active subwoofers"
 iske vipareet, "niskriy" sabavuparon ko bahari pravardhan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a woofer is a driver that reproduces low frequencies
 driver antahkshetra ke dizin ke saath sangyojan karke upyukt nune aavritiyaan utpann karata he 
 kuch laudspikar system sabase kam aavritiyon ke liye vufar kaa upyog karte hai, kabhi-kabhi sabavufar kaa upyog na karne ke liye paryaapt hota he
 Additionally, some loudspeakers use woofers for mid-frequencies, eliminating the need for a mid-range driver
 ise ek aise twitor kaa chayan karke purna kiya ja saktaa he, jo kaaphi neeche kaam kar saktaa he, kaaphi oonchi aavritiyon par pratikriya dene vaale vufar ke saath sanyojit hokar, madhya aavritiyon main donon driver sansakt rupase jud jate hai
 a mid-range speaker is a loudspeaker driver that produces mid-frequencies
 madhya duuri driver diaphram kaagaj yaa mishrit saamagree se banaaya ja saktaa he or pratyaksh vikiran driver ho sakate hai
 Or they can be compression drivers
 If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be installed on a loudspeaker enclosure in front of the enclosure, or if there is a compression driver, to be installed on the neck of the horn to control the extra output level and radiation pattern
 Can

 There are many varieties of tweeter designs, each having different capabilities with respect to frequency response, output fidelity, conduction, maximum output level, etc
 narm-gumbad twitor gharelu sterio system main vyapak rup se paae jate hai or bhumpu sajjit sampeedan driver peshewar dhwani prabalan main lokapriy hai
 Ribbon tweeters have gained popularity in recent years, as their output power has been increased to a level useful for professional sound reinforcement and their output pattern is wide in the horizontal plane, a pattern that has convenient applications for music festivals
 ek samakshiya driver do yaa adhik sanyukt sankendriya driveron ke saath ek laudspikar driver he
 Coaxial drivers have been made by many companies, such as Altech, Tannoy, Pioneer, KEF, BMS, Kabase, and Janilek
 multi-driver spikar system main prayukt, crossover ek sabsystem he jo nivesh sanket ko vibhinn driveron ke anukool aavriti simaaon main pruthak rakhata he
 Drivers receive electric power within their usable frequency range and thus reduce distortion and interference between the drivers
 crossover sakriy yaa niskriy ho sakate hai
 a passive crossover is an electronic circuit using one or more resistor, inductive or non-polar capacitor combinations
 ye bhaag dhyanpurvak dizin kiye gaye network main gathit kiye gaye hai or pravardhak ke sanketon ko alag-alag driveron ko vitarit karne se purv aavashyak aavriti band main vibhajit karne ke liye inhen adhiktar vidyut pravardhak tathaa laudspikar driveron ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 The passive crossover circuit itself does not require any external electric power beyond the audio signal but there is a significant reduction in the damping coefficient between the speech call and the crossover
 ek sakriy crossover ek electronic filter paripath he, jo shakti pravardhan se purv sanket ko alag-alag aavriti band main vibhajit karata he, is prakaar prayek bandpas ke liye kam se kam ek vidyut pravardhak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Passive filters can also be used in this way before power amplification, but this is an unusual solution due to the persistence compared to active filtering
 koi bhi takanic jo crossover filtering ke baad pravardhan kaa upyog karti he, vah saamanytah nunatam pravardhak channelon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par bai-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping or isi prakaar aage, ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Some loudspeaker designs use a combination of passive and active crossover filtering, such as passive crossover between mid- and high-frequency drivers, and low-frequency driver combined active crossover between middle and high frequencies
 niskriy crossover saamanytah spikar bakse ke andar santhaapit hote hai or ghar tathaa kam shakti ke upyog ke liye crossover kaa sabase saamaanya prakaar he
 In car audio systems, passive crossover may be required in a separate box, adjusting the size of the components used
 Passive crossover may be common for low-level filtering, or complex to provide steep slopes of 18 to 24 db per octave
 Passive crossovers can be designed to accommodate undesired characteristics of driver, geopolymer or enclosure resonance and may make implementation difficult due to components interactions
 niskriy crossover kii, driver ikaayiyon jinhen ve fid karte hai, kii bhaanti vidyut vahan seemaa hoti he, niveshan haani hoti hai 10% aksar daawa kiya he) or pravardhak dwaara dekha bhaar badal jate hai
 Changes in the hi-fi world are a matter of concern for many
 jab ucch utpaadan str kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, sakriy crossover behatar ho saktaa he
 Active crossover may be simple circuits that equal the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing wider audio adjustments
 kuch sakriy crossover, aamtaur par digital laudspikar prabandhan pranali main, aavriti bainds ke bich phej or samay main sateek sanrekhan, tulyakaran or gatik niyantran shaamil ho sakate hai
 Some hi-fi and professional loudspeaker systems now include an active crossover circuit as part of an onboard amplifier system
 ye spikar dizin ek pravardhak-purv se ek sanket cabel ke alaava apni asi vidyut kii aavashyaktaa se pahachaane ja sakate hai
 This active structure may include driver protection circuits and other features of a digital loudspeaker management system
 computer dhwani main sanchalit spikar system aam hai or aakaar ke spectrum ke duusare chor par, aadhunik sangeet kaarykram sound system jahaan unki upasthiti bad rahi he mahatvapurn or teji se
 Most loudspeaker systems have drivers mounted in the enclosure or a cabinet, mounted in an enclosure consisting of drivers
 The role of the enclosure is to provide a place for the drivers to physically mount and to prevent destructive interference with the sound waves emanating from the front of the driver's back; These usually result in significant levels and quality changes at cancellations and low frequencies
 saralatam driver arohan ek sapaat panel hota he, jiske chhidron main driver arohit hote hai
 However, in this method, sound frequencies of longer wavelength than the amplitude of the resist are canceled out, because the transverse radiation from the back of the cone interferes with the radiation from the obverse
 ek aseem bade panel ke saath, is vyatikaran ko puri tarah roka ja saktaa he
 This action can be performed from a sufficiently large sealed box
 chunki anant aayam ke panel avyaavhaarik hai, adhiktar antahkshetra gatisheel diafram se prishth vikiran ko samit karke kaary karte hai
 a sealed enclosure prevents transmission of sound emitted from the back of the loudspeaker by limiting the sound to a rigid and airtight box

 However, a rigid enclosure internally reverts the sound, which can be transmitted back through the loudspeaker diaphragm - again resulting in degradation of sound quality
 ise avasorak saamagree kaa upyog karke aantarik avasorana dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he, jaise antahkshetra main kaanch ke reshe, oon, yaa synthetic fibre batting kaa prayog
 antahkshetra ke aantarik aakaar ko bhi is prakaar dizin kiya ja saktaa he ki dhwani ko laudspikar diafram se dur prayavartit kiya ja sake, jahaan use avashoshit kar liya jaae
 Other types of enclosure convert sound radiation so that it is creatively added to the output produced from the front of the cone
 aisa karne vaale diginon kaa upyog praayah prabhavi nune-aavriti anukriya kaa vistaar karne or driver kaa nune-aavriti nirgam badhaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 To make the transition between drivers as seamless as possible, by shifting forward or backward to one or more driver's mounting points so that each driver's acoustic center stays in the same vertical plane, system designers attempt to time-align the drivers

 The speaker mounting scheme can also produce diffraction which can result in chirping and degradation of frequency responses
 ucchtar aavritiyon par, jahaan tarangadairghy cabinet ke aayam ke samaan yaa chote hai, samasya saamanytah sabase badi ho jaati he
 This effect is achieved by rounding the front edges of the cabinet, rotating the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorbent material around the driver, or any combination of these or other schemes
 Can be reduced by using
 adhiktar laudspikaron main sanket strot ke saath sangyojan ke liye do taron ke siron kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This is done by tying the column to the back of the enclosure or by applying spring clips

 This type of telegraph does not harm the speakers, but is not optimal

 The output specifications of most amplifiers are given at a specific power in an ideal resistive load, however, the resistance of a loudspeaker in its frequency range is not fixed

 The result is a load resistance that varies quite widely with frequency and usually also has a variable phase relationship between a voltage and an electric current, which also varies with frequency
 kuch pravardhak in badlaavon kaa saamana dusron kii tulana main behatar kar sakate hai
 To produce sound, a loudspeaker is driven by a modulated electric current, which passes through a "speaker coil", which then magnetizes the coil, creating a magnetic field

 It is essentially impossible to completely characterize the sound output quality of a loudspeaker or system

 Loudspeaker efficiency is defined as sound power output divided by electrical power input

 Most of the remaining speech turns into heat in the coil and magnet combinations

 laudspikar driveron kii dakshata aavriti ke saath bhi badalati he
 For example, the output of a woofer driver decreases when the input frequency decreases due to the increasing poor matching between air and driver
 die hue nivesh ke liye espel ke aadhaar par driver anumatank ko samvedansheeltaa anumatank kaha jaataa he or saidhantik rup se yah dakshata ke samaan hai
 Sensitivity is generally defined as the number of decibels at 1 w electrical input, often measured at 1 meter at a single frequency
 The voltage used is often 2
83 VRMS, which is 1 watt at 8Ω speaker impedance
 Measurements taken with this reference are quoted as db at 2
83 v @ 1 m
 dhwani dabaav nirgam laudspikar se ek meter par tathaa aksh par mapa jaataa he, ki shart ke tahat ki laudspikar ek aseem badi jagah main ek aseem avarohak par arohit hokar vikirit ho rahaa he
 Obviously then, sensitivity is not directly correlated with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the acoustic environment in front of the actual loudspeaker
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek prashansak kaa shring us disha main adhik dhwani nirgam utpann karata he jis disha main iskaa rukh kiya jaataa he, dhwani tarangon ko prashansak se ek hi disha main sankendrit karte hue, is prakaar "kendrit" hota he
 The horn also improves impedance matching between speech and air, producing more acoustic power than a given speaker power
 kuch maamalon main, behatar pratibaadha milan spikar ko adhik dhvanik shakti kaa utpaadan karne kii anumati degaa
 It is not necessary that a driver with high maximum power titer may not necessarily be driven at a faster level than a low-rated speaker, as sensitivity and power management are largely independent properties
 aagle udaahranon main, maanalen ki tulana kiye ja rahe donon driveron kii vidyut pratibaadha samaan he; donon samaan aavriti par apane-apane paas band par sanchalit hai; or shakti sampeedan tathaa virupan kam hai
 For the first example, one speaker is 3 db more sensitive than the other, producing two times the sound power for the same power input, thus, 92 db for a 100 watt driver titer @ 1 m sensitivity for a 200 watt tether driver
 1 watt @ 1 meter will generate twice the acoustic power compared to 89 db, while the current is run at a uniform 100 watt investment
 is vishisht udhaaharan main, jab 100 wat par sanchalit he, spikar e utana hi SPL yaa tivrata kaa utpaadan karegaa, jitna spikar bi 200 wat nivesh ke saath utpaadan karata he
 Thus, a 3 db increase in sensitivity of a speaker means that it will require half the amplifier power to achieve the given SPL
 This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier and often, lower overall system cost
 ucch dakshata kaa compact antahkshetra aakaar or paryaapt kam aavriti pratikriya ke saath sangyojan sambhav nahin he
 When designing a speaker system, only two out of three standards can be selected

 is anguuthe ke niyam ko kabhi-kabhi hollman kaa louh niyam The interaction of a loudspeaker system with its environment is complex and largely beyond the control of the loudspeaker designer
 adhikansh shravan kaksh aakaar, rup, khand or saaj-saamaan ke aadhaar par ek newnaadhik chintansheel vaataavaran prastut karte hai
 This means that the sound that reaches the ears of a listener is not only the sound coming directly from the speaker system, but the same sound travels through one or more surfaces and reaches late
 ye parilakshith dhwani tarangen, jab pratyaksh dhwani se judati hai to chaynit aavritiyon par nirasan tathaa yojan hote hai, is prakaar shrota ke kaan main dhwani ke lay or charitra badale hue pahunchate hai
 The human brain is very sensitive to small changes, including some of these, and this is part of the reason why loudspeaker systems give different sounds in different listening conditions or in different rooms
 ek laudspikar system kii aawaaj main ek mahatvapurn kaarak vaataavaran main maujuud prasar or avasorana kii raashi he
 The clap in a typical empty room without a hand, curtains or carpets, produces a sharp echo, which is both due to lack of absorption and maintenance from flat walls, floors and ceilings

 This to some extent breaks the reflection caused by otherwise naked flat surfaces and propagates the reflected energy of the incident wave to a larger reflection angle

 In addition, there are complex resonance states with three, four, five and even six boundary surfaces in which all surfaces combine to form backward waves

 The proximity of the loudspeakers to the room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are stimulated, as well as the relative power at each frequency
 shrota kaa sthaan bhi mahatvapurn he, jaise ki ek seemaa ke nikat ek sthaan par aavritiyon ke kathith santulan par ek bada prabhaav ho saktaa he
 This is because the backward wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the Schroeder frequency - typically around 200–300 Hz, depending on the size of the room
 dhwani visheshgyon ne, dhwani sroton ke vikiran kaa adhyayan karne main kuch samajhane ke liye mahatvapurn avadharanaon kaa vikaas kiya he ki kaise laudspikaron ko samajha jaataa he
 The simplest possible radiation source is a point source, sometimes called a simple source
 ek adarsh bindu strot ek ati sookshm dhwani vikirankaari sookshm bindu he
 It may be easy to imagine a small vibrating sphere, whose diameter decreases and increases uniformly, sending sound waves uniformly in all directions, free of frequency
 ek laudspikar system sahit, kisi bhi dhwani utpaadak vastu, ke aise hi saadhaaran binduon ke sangyojan se bane hone ke bare main sochaa ja saktaa he
 The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources will not be similar to a single source, but will depend on the distance and orientation between sources, the relative position from which the listener listens and the frequency of the referenced sound
 By using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources can be solved easily, others do not
 ek saadhaaran sangyojan he, do saral strot ek duuri ke dwaara alag he or pravastha-bahya kampan kar rahe hai, ek sookshm gole kaa vistaar hota he, to duusare kaa sankuchan

 The direction of a dipole is 8 points in size, and the maximum output is with a vector connecting the two sources and toward the minimum side when the observation point is equidistant from both sources, where positive and negative waves cancel a spur
 jabaki adhikansh driver dwidhruv hai, jis antahkshetra se ve jude hai uske aadhaar par, ve ekaladhruv yaa dwidhruv kii tarah vikiran kar sakate hai
 If mounted on a finite resistor and these phase-out waves are allowed to interact, the dipole frequency response results in a vertex and a zero
 jab prishth vikiran ko avashoshit yaa ek box main roak liya jaataa he, diafram ek ekadhruviya vikirak ho jaataa he
 Bipolar speakers are a method of deriving omnidirectional radiation patterns created by phase-mounting monolithic to opposite sides of a box
 vaastavik jivan main, alag-alag driver vastav main jatil shanku or gumbadon ke rup main 3di aakaar hai or inhen vibhinn kaarnon se badhika par rakhaa jaataa he
 a mathematical expression for the directivity of a complex shape, based on a modeled combination of point sources, usually not possible but the directivity of a loudspeaker with a spherical diaphragm is similar to that of a flat spherical piston, so it is discussed Can be used as a simplified example
 shaamil ganitiya bhautikee ke ek saral udhaaharan, nimnlikhit par vichaar kiijie:ek anant badhika par ek golakaar piston kii durakshetra dishikata ke liye sutara p = p 0 j 1 k a sin ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle p={ \ frac {p_{0}j_{1}}{k_{a} \ sin \ theta }}} haijahaan k a = 2 π a λ { \ displaystyle k_{a}={ \ frac {2 \ pi a}{ \ lambda }}}, p 0 { \ displaystyle p_{0}} aksh par dabaav he, a { \ displaystyle a} trigya he piston, λ { \ displaystyle \ lambda } arthath tarangadairghy he θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } aksh kone he or j 1 { \ displaystyle J_{1}} pratham prakaar kaa basal falan he
 a plane source will radiate the same sound for equally low frequencies whose wavelengths are longer than the dimensions of the plane source and as the frequency increases the sound from such a source will be concentrated in an increasing narrower angle
 
 The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this contraction of directivity occurs
 yahaan tak ki agar diafram bilkul golakaar nahin he, yah prabhaav is prakaar hota he ki bade strot adhik dishik he
 Many loudspeaker designs have been made which have almost the same behavior
 adhiktar sthiravaidyut yaa chumbakeey samtal dizin hai
 Different manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements to create a specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed, to create a specific sound type in the space for which they are designed
 The resulting radiation pattern may be intended to closely simulate the sound produced by real instruments, or to create a controlled energy distribution just from the input signal
 An earlier example is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1 / 8 sphere
 The design of such a system was patented by Professor Amar Bose-2201 and actually produced commercially
 baad main bose modelon main jaan-boojhkar vaataavaran kii parvaah kiye bina laudspikar dwaara swayan sidhe yaa paravartit dhwani ke utpaadan par jor diya gaya
 These designs have been controversial in high-fidelity circles, but have proved commercially successful
 kai anya nirmaataaon ke dizin samaan siddhanton kaa paalan karte hai
 Directivity is an important issue because it affects the frequency balance of the sound the listener listens to, as well as the speaker system's interaction with the room and its accessories

 Increasing directivity at very wide or high frequencies can give the impression that the treble is too high, or too low
 This is part of the reason why the full characteristic of the sound of a loudspeaker given the response measurement on the axis is not described

 vaak pravardhak megaphone main shring kaa upyog kam se kam 17veen shatabdi jitna purana he or yantric gramophone main shring kaa upyog sabase pehle 1857 main hota tha
 Ring loudspeakers designed in front of or behind the horn loudspeaker driver are used to increase the loudspeaker directionality and for small diameter conversion, high pressure position on the long diameter driver cone surface and low pressure position on the horn face
 is se laudspikar kii samvedansheeltaa bad jaati he or dhwani ek parimit kshetra main kendrit ho jaati he
 With neck size, mouth, horn length, as well as area expansion rate, it should be noted that matching drives should be carefully selected to provide conversion functions across a range of frequencies
 The length required to make a bass and the transverse mouth area or sub-bass horn is required to be several feet long
 'vulture rings' can reduce the overall size but force designers to compromise and accept increased complexity such as cost and construction
 kuch shring dizin na keval kam aavriti shrung ko valit karata he lekin, kamare ke kone main diwaar kaa upyog shring mukh ke vistaar ke rup main karte hai
 In the late 1940s, Shringas, whose faces occupied much of the room's wall, were no longer unknown among hi-fi fans
 Room-size installations were much less acceptable when two or more were needed

 Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over traditional loudspeakers: they are overload resistors that typically destroy most high frequency drivers and can be used without a crossover due to their electrical properties
 vahiin nuksaan bhi hai: kuch pravardhak thartharaana sakate hai jaise adhikansh pijovidhyut, jiske parinamswaroop virupan yaa pravardhak ko kshati ho saktaa he
 Additionally, their frequency response is, in most cases, lighter than other technologies

 Piezoelectric speakers can have extended high frequency outputs, this is useful for certain situations: for example sonar applications that have piezoelectric adaptations as output devices and input devices
 These applications have their advantages, not even simple, solid state construction that can resist the effects of seawater better than ribbon-based devices

 Magnetic distortion speaker drivers have some special advantages: they can provide more force than other techniques, short excursions can prevent distortions from large excursions in other designs; The magnetization coil is stable and can therefore be cooled more easily, as they are stronger, do not require a delicate suspension and a walk coil

 Their disadvantage is that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited due to practical construction limitations, the stator is positioned forward, requiring higher voltages to achieve acceptable efficiency, which increases the tendency of the electric arc, as well as dust by the speaker
 The attracting of particles increases

 Due to this reason and low excursion capacity, the full range electrostatic loudspeakers are larger in nature and the bass will roll at a frequency of wavelengths equal to one quarter of the narrowest panel amplitude
 To reduce the size of commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles bass frequencies

 The states of Bahawalpur, Kheripore and Kalat are particularly notable in this regard

 The bloody clashes at the time of partition further divided Bengali Muslims and Hindus
 us saimay, bengal ke muslim bahul zile, mountbayton yojana ko sweekruti ke pashchaat, vibhaajan ke pakshadhar the, or, unhone purvi bengalko pakistan adhirajya ke saath sammilit kar diya
 From 1947 to 1954, East Bengal remained an independent administrative unit of Pakistan, being governed by the Pakistan Muslim League, led by Nurul Amin
 varsh 1955 main, bengali pradhanmantri mohammad ali bogra ne praant purvi bengal ko visthapit kar, ek ikai niti ke antargat, purvi pakistan ko sthapit kiya, jisaki rajdhani, dhaka thi
 In the elections of 1954, the Pakistan Muslim League suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the United Front led by the Awami League

 varsh 1965 ke raashtrapatijna chunaav main purvi pakistan ekamat se ne ayub khan ke viruddh, fatima jinnah ke paksh main matdaan kiya
 These elections were widely believed to be rigged, in favor of Ayub Khan, and it was felt that they, in state patronage, tried to influence the electoral college of indirect elections through state patronage and intimidation

 In 1966, the six-time movement brought by the Awami League increased support for state autonomy among the public, and demonstrated strongly in the 1970 election over the Awami League Issy issue and gained a clear and exclusive majority in East Pakistan, and Simultaneously, the Awami League also won a clear majority in the Parliament of Pakistan
 aam chunaav ke pashchaat, pakistan piples party ne awami lig ke janadesh ko maan ne se inkaar kiya, or awami lig ke sarkaar banane kaa virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 In this situation, the then military president Yahya Khan attempted to reconcile between the two political parties, and at the center, advised to form co-operatives

 In response, the Awami League declared independence of Purvi Pakistan on 26 March 1971, and declared a liberation war, in support of which India began to provide military support to the Mukti Corps

 Albinism is a disease of the eyes in which the patient is not able to perceive any one or more colors; Due to which the power of color perception is less than the power of color of ordinary people
 yah rog janm se ho saktaa he, athwa katipay rogon ke baad utpann ho saktaa he
 The ordinary person can well perceive the lightness or deepness of the color
 par is rog main vyakti kii rangon ke gaharepan kaa bodh yaa rangon ko pahchaanane kii shakti lupt ho jaati he
 Different classes of disease and their names are also based on the perception of one color or mixture of colors in the spectrum
 manushya main samaan rup se rang kaa bodh trivarnataa ke siddhant se hota he
 According to this theory, color perception occurs through a diverse mixture of three colors
 ye teenon shuddh or mukhya rang hai : laal, haraa tathaa nila; jinaki pruthak maatra ke mishran se sab prakaar ke rang ban jate hai tathaa in pruthak rangon kaa vishesh bodh drushti dwaara hota he

 Such persons are called deformed tri-particles, which require all the three pure colors in different proportions for color perception than normal people
 jin vyaktiyon main teen ke sthaan par do yaa ek hi rang dwaara rangabodh hota he, ve kramash: dwivarnak tathaa ekavarnak kehalaate hai
 Disorders of color blindness are most commonly found in unicellular individuals, less frequently in diabetic individuals, and lastly in the least tivaric individuals
 jin vyaktiyon ko laal tathaa hare rangon kaa bodh nahin hota, unhen laal evam haraa varnaandh tathaa pile evam nile rangon kaa bodh na hone par pilaa evam nila varnaandh aadi kehete hai
 The pigment of birth requires the maximum amount of green color and such a person has difficulty in different perception of light green and yellow color
 kuch vyaktiyon ko laal rang kaa bodh nahin hota he, at: aise vyaktiyon ko is varnandhta ke kaaran saamaanya jivan main badi kathinaayee uthaani padati he
 It is true that such a colorless person generates the power to identify objects only by the varied depth, brightness, and shape of the color, but such a person makes a mistake in deciding on the subjects dependent on the knowledge of color recognition
 There may be severe consequences, for example mistake of identifying traffic signal etc

 jaise 3 sankhya purvokt samucchy s kaa sadsy nahin he; ise ham likhte hai ki 3 ∉ s { \ displaystyle 3 otin S} 
 "∈ { \ displaystyle \ in}" This sign is called 'member'
 yadi kisi samucchy a ke sabhi sadsy kisi anya samucchy b ke bhi sadsy hai to yah kaha jaataa he ki A, b kaa upasamucchy he
 For example, if a = {p, q, r} and b = {p, q, r, s}, we write that a ⊂ b { \ displaystyle a \ subset B} must be two subsets of each set; One is itself a subset of itself, the second set of zeros is a subset of all the sets
 samucchy {a,b,c} ke sabhi upasamucchyon ko likhen to ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset }, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c} evam {a,b,c} tathaa shunya samucchy
 If a set has n members, the number of all its subsets will be 2 n { \ displaystyle 2 ^ {n}}
 jis upasamucchy main sadasyon kii sankhya mul samucchy ke sadasyon kii sankhya se kam ho use 'uchit upasamucchy' kehete hai
 The set formed by taking all the existing components in a problem is called an all-inclusive set relative to that problem
 udhaaharan ke liye, 11 sankhya tak sabhi visham sankhyaon kaa sarvasamaveshi samucchy hoga - ξ { \ displaystyle \ xi \ } ={1,3,5,7,9,11} Many problems of set theory are easily solved using the Venn diagram
 sarvasamaveshi samucchy ko ek aayat dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he tathaa iske sabhi upasamucchyon ko vrutt dwaara darshaya jaataa he
 In this diagram the complementary set of a is shown by shading, ie a c { \ displaystyle a ^ {c}}
 iske alaava vrutt ke bheetar vrutt banaakar upasamucchyon ko darshaate hai
 Such as b ⊆ a { \ displaystyle b \ subseteq A} do samucchy a or b hon to inkaa sarvanishtha samucchy vah samucchy hoga jisamen ve sadsy honge jo a or b donon main hon
 For example, if a = {2,4,7} and b = {2,3,7,8}, then the common set of a and b will be {2,7} which we write as: a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} = {2,7} What is shown by the shadow in the Venn diagram in the picture is a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B}
 do samucchy a or b kaa sangh vah samucchy he jiske sadsy ve hai jo a main hai, yaa b main hai yaa donon main hai
 For example, if a = {3,4,6} and b = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then we will write the union of these two sets as: a ∪ b { \ displaystyle a \ cup B} = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
 yadi do samucchyon a or b main koi bhi sadsy ubhaynishth nahin he to in donon samucchyon ko asamyukt samucchy kaha jaataa he
 We write it like this: a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} = ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset} samucchy main avyavon kaa vibhinn hona aavashyak he
 If x is any element of the set A, we write: x ∈ A
 sabhi avyavon kaa byora na dekar, unhen niyam dwaara bhi bataaya ja saktaa he, jaise visham sankhyaon kaa samucchy
 b is called a subset of a when each element of b is a member of a and writes it as: b ⊂ A
 It reads as follows: b is included in A
 yadi a main kam se kam ek aisa avyav ho jo b kaa sadsy nahin he or B, a kaa upasamucchy he, to b ko a kaa vaastavik upasamucchy kehete hai
 Such a set, which does not have a single component, is called a zero set and expresses it with φ

 The French Revolution was a period of political and social upheaval and radical changes in the history of France that lasted from 1789 to 1799
 baad main, nepolian bonapart ne francisi samrajya ke vistaar dwaara kuch ansh tak is kranti ko aage badhaayaa
 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe
 is kranti ne aadhunik itihaas kii disha badal di
 This led to the decline of the absolute monarchy around the world, new republics and liberal democracies

 He made laws against his will

 France expanded by diplomacy and military prowess

 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept
 lui 15waan atyant vilaasi, adoordarshee or niskriy shaasha tha
 Participated in Austria's succession war and the Seven Year War caused great damage to the country's economic condition

 He had no understanding of the troubles of the common man
 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy

 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats

 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi

 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society

 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy
 vastutah france ke raajaaon kii phijulkharchi tathaa lui 14wein ke lagaataar yudhon ke kaaran shahi kosh khaali ho gaya tha

 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy

 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom

 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"

 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights

 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people

 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this

 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers

 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality

 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control

 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places

 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians
 jiske anusaar “saamaanya ichha” hi saarvbhaumik ichha he
 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
