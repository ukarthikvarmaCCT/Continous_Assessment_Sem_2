 However, they may be restored only by a "clear sign" from God who speaks holy and untainted words - the Prophet Muhammad bringing the Qur'an, which lays down proper laws and morality
 The fifth ayat explains that all God asks of mankind is, "to praise God by offering Him devotion being true, to pray the salat, and to give charity
 And that is the Religion of Truth
" Those to cling to these simple truths will be offered the Gardens of Paradise, "down which rivers flow" as their prize; for God is pleased with them for being the best of possible creations
 Those who turn away, however, shall meet the fires of Hell

 After his sacrifice, Bhai Mani Singh Khalsa and other Khalsa brothers collected all the works of Guru Gobind Singh ji by the orders of his religious wife Mata Sundari and put them in a book which is today called "dasam Granth"
 sidhe shabdon main kaha jaye to guru gobind singh ji ne rachana kii or khalse ne sampadanaa kii
 The entire Sikh community is entertained by the Dasam Granth
 dasam granth kii vaaniyaan jaise kii jaap sahib, tav parasaad savaiye or chopai sahib sikhon ke rojaanaa sajadaa, nitnem, kaa hissaa he or yah vaaniyaan khande bate kii pahole, jis ko aam bhashaa main amrit chakna kehete hai, ko banaate vakt padhi jaati hai
 In the gurudwaras of Takhat Hazur Sahib, Takhat Patna Sahib and Nihang Singh, the Dasam Granth is lighted with Guru Granth Sahib and is also taken daily

 Due to these reasons, Pahari Raje and Brahmin began to envy Satgur Gobind Singh and started provoking the government against them
 katad musalamaanon ko bhi pataa chalaa kii gobind singh ne apni vaani main musalamaanon ke upar bhi tipni kii he wo bhi khilaaf ho gaye
 In the Atha Pakhyana Charitra Kitaute, the characters of clever women and men wrote how this world is prone to envy, hostility, work and other disorders

 Guru Sahib made Aurangzeb aware of his truth in Zafurnama that he is not an intelligent king and is not able to do justice, not only that he is a non-muslim who is under the control of Quran Sharif
 yah patr satgur ne dina, malwa punjab main likhaa
 Apart from this, in the Shastra Naam Mala, the weapons were watered in the spiritual style and in 33 Savaiya, the rituals and beliefs were hit

 4) In 1741, the slogans composed by Bhai Sevadas mention Ram Avatar, 22 Savaiya, Zafarnama and Hikayats composed by Satgur Gobind Singh Dura
 5) 1752 main, gurbilas paatshahi 10 main koer singh kalaal ji ne zikr kiya he kii guru gobind singh ji ne bachitr naatak, krishna avatar, vishnu avatar, akaal usatati, jaap sahib, zafarnama, hikaayatein likhi hai or yah pehla itihaasak granth he jisame aadi granth ji ko guru pad dene kii baat darj he
 6) In 1766, Kesar Singh Chhibber ji in his book Bansavalinama mentions how Mata Sundari and Khalsa Bhai compiled the Dasam Granth
 yah pehali kitaab he jis main guru gobind singh kii maut ke baad hue ghatana karm kaa zikr he
 7) In 1766, Sarup Chand Bhalla Ji Duaara Mahima Prakash has written a pictorial play titled Satguru Gobind Singh Dura, and not only the characters' lectures and avatars are also mentioned
 8) 1790 main, guru kin sakhiyaan rachit sarup singh koshish ne bhi bataaya he kii guru sahib ne bachitr naatak, krishna avatar, shaastra naam maala, adik vaani khud likhi hai
 8) In 1797, Sukha Singh ji in Gurbilas Patshahi 10 mentions the speech of Guru Gobind Singh
 9) 1812 main, angreji vidvan je bi malkom ne sketch of sikhs main dasam bani kaa varnan kiya he or bataaya he kii yah granth guru granth sahib ke saath parkashit hota tha or sikh isamen baraabar shardha rakhte the

 Forfeiture or forfeiture a method of determining land revenue in India in the Middle Ages based on measurement
 yah bharat main suron or mughalon ke samay main prachlit thi
 Sadhnaat: Forfeited, but sometimes called zabti and zarib or 'amal-e-zarib'
 abul fazal ke anusaar sur raja shershah or islam shah is paddati ke pravartak the
 Its main feature was, unlike other methods, which was based on measurement ie the rate of 'kanakut' crops per bigha was determined in advance and not at the time of harvesting
 vaastavik bhoomi rajasav kii dar kii 1 / 3 thi, or yah niyam naapi hui bhoomi par rajasav prapti ke liye lagu kiya jaataa tha
 That revenue was first taken in the commodity itself, then converted into cash based on the then prices

 In revenue, cash was determined by the land revenue multiplied by the sown Araji Dastur
 dastur jinamein samay samay par parivartan hota tha, praaia: prati varsh upaj or mulyon kii daron ko dekhe bina lagu hota tha
 In the event of divine calamity, the demand was cut, without the change in the custom, the objectionable area was reduced from the Araji

 Metering was only when the farmer or officer was not satisfied with the earlier measurement, if it was not based on the present yield

 The confiscated area under Akbar was further developed, although it is doubtful that extensive agricultural land outside Delhi and the provinces would have been measured and determined

 The B'nai Brith Library, founded in 1892 in Jerusalem, was the first public library in Palestine serving the Jewish community
 pustkaalay B'nai Brith sadak par sthit Meah Shearim pados or roosi yogic ke bich hua tha
 Ten years later, the Midrash Abrabanel Library, as it was then known, moved to Ethiopia Street in 1920, when plans were ready for the Hebrew University, the B'nai Brith collection became the basis for a university library 
 pustakon ke liye Scopus mount chale gaye the jab vishvavidhyalay ke paanch saal baad kholaa gaya
 In 1948, when access to the university campus on Mount Scopus blocked, most of the books were moved to the university's temporary room at the Terra Sancta building in Rehavia

 In the 1970s, when the new university campus on Mount Scopus was inaugurated and the Faculty of Law, Humanities and Social Sciences returned, departmental libraries opened on that campus and the number of visitors to the Givat Ram Library dropped
 In the 1990s, construction suffered from maintenance problems and pest infestation such as rainwater leaks

 Under this, soil building, classification of soil, study of physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, study of fertility etc
 are done
 mrudaa vaigyanik is baat ko lekar chintit hai ki vishwa kii jansankhya-vruddhi ke saath mrudaa tathaa kheti yogya bhoomi kaa sarakshan kaise kiya jaay
 Man knows the soil from time immemorial
 dharti, jis par vah hal chalaata he, khet jisamen vah fasalein ugaata he or ghar jisamen vah rahata he, ye sabhi hamen mitti kii yaad dilaate hai
 But our knowledge of soil is often negligible
 yah sabhi jaanate hai ki anaaj or fal mitti main upjate hai or yah upaj khaad evam urvarkon ke upyog se badhaai ja sakati he, lekin mitti ke anya visheshtaon ke bare main, jinase ham sadak, bhawan, dhawnpath tathaa bandhon kaa nirmaan karte hai, hamaara gyaan bahut kam he
 Knowledge of the chemical and physical composition of the soil is necessary to understand the behavior of soil properly
 bhautikee kii drushti se mitti ke teen avyav hai, ret, silt or mrittika
 Sand is a gross component, which has neither capillary nor condensation
 ret ke kanon kaa aakaar 0
05 mimi0 se 2 mimi0 ke bich hota he
 Silt particles are also finer than sand
 inkaa aakaar 0
05 mimi0 se 0
002 mimi0 ke bich hota he
 Both sand and sila are inert substances
 teesraa mahatvapurn avyav mrittika he, jiske kan 0
002 mimi0 se chote hote hai
 The major difference between sand, silt and clay is that where sand and silt are inert, the clay is chemically active
 mitti kii banabat kaaphi seemaa tak in avyavon kii pratishtata par nirbhar he
 When there is an excess of sand, silts and clay, the soil is called sandy, silty and mattiar respectively
 in avyavon ko prati shat nirdhaaran bhautikeey vishleshan kehalaata he
 The texture of sandy soil is open, due to which the air circulation is sufficient and if the amount of mineral content in the soil is sufficient, then this soil is more suitable for cultivation
 matiyaar mitti sookhne par paryaapt sikudti he or paryaapt pani se khub phoolati bhi he
 Such soil is neither good for agriculture nor for building houses
 khuli banaavat vaali mitti saghanta kii kami ke karan krishi ke liye acchhee hoti he, kyonki jal atirikt sthalon main pravisht kar khanij lavenon ko ghulaa saktaa he; par ejiniyari ke kaam ke liye yah mitti acchhee nahin hoti, kyonki jal pravesh ke kaaran mitti main saghanta honi chahie
 The denser the soil, the greater its strength and firmness
 saghanta kaa ghanatv vastut: ardrata kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 The percentage of humidity that provides maximum density for a particular type of soil is called the optimum humidity of that soil
 ishtatam ardrata halake roller kii tulana main baari roller ke liye kam hoti he
 The soil in which the compaction of low-size particles is good, has the highest density
 sanghanit mitti kii prabalata banaae rakhane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki pani ke mridukaran prabhaav kaa vah pratirohak ho
 For this, cement, lime, chemicals or bituminous substances are added to the soil
 yah pehle hi bataaya ja chukaa he ki mitti main pradhanthya ret, silt or mrittika rahete hai
 Along with these, it contains some solutes and some insoluble salts, such as carbonates of calcium and magnesium and chlorides and sulfates of sodium and potassium
 anek roopon main bhinn sandratha ke carbonic padaarth bhi rahete hai
 All these affect the chemical behavior of the soil
 jaisaa ki pehle bataaya ja chukaa he, ret or silt niskriy hai tathaa mrittika hi rasayanat: sakriy he, at: mittish ke rasinic gun mrittika par avlambit hai
 The clay is formed as a complex structure of many elements, such as iron, aluminum, silicon, etc
 mrittika ke khanij sanmishra ke kuch gun vilakshan hai
 It is insoluble in water, but may remain suspended in it
 iskaa nilambit rahanaa kanon ke aakaar par nirbhar he
 In the suspended state it gives acidic reaction
 isaki amlata aseetic amla kii amlata sadyash he
 This acidity can be neutralized by alkaline substances such as calcium and sodium hydroxide
 iske falswaroop calcium or sodium mittiyaan banati hai
 Due to the granular structure, calcicham soil is suitable for agriculture, but sodium soil is more useful for building dams and roads due to water logging
 mitti dwaara calcium ayan avashoshit hokar aisa sthirikrut ho jaataa he ki shuddh jal ke dwaara vah ghulkar nikal jaataa par anya lavan se saralata se pratisthapit ho jaataa he
 For example, when calcium soil is neutralized by a salt solution, sodium clay is formed from it and calcium ion comes into the solution in the form of chloride
 sodium mitti ko phir calcium, yaa anya mittiyon ke vilyan ke saath apkshalit karne se calcium, yaa anya dhaatuon kii mittiyon main parinat kiya ja saktaa he
 This property of soil, in which alkali is exchanged, is called the "exchange property of soil" and the cationic soils are interchangeable, of which calcium, sodium, potassium and manganium are the main ones and nickel, cobalt, boron etc
 are very few
 They live in moderation, although they are necessary for plant growth
 sookshm maatra main rahane vaale in tatwon ko anuposh "tatv' kehete hai
 The percentage of cation in a soil depends on exchange holdings, which are higher in montmorillonite grade soil and lower in kaolinite grade soil
 maantmarilonite koti kii mitti kaa udhaaharan kapaas vaali kaali mitti he, jo bharat ke madhyapradesh, madras or bombai ke kuch bhaagon main faili hui he
 Keolinite clay is commonly found in the alluvial plains of India
 jaisaa pehle sanket kiya ja chukaa he ki jis mitti main tanu amla ke upachaar se vinimeya kshar kaa nitant abhaav he, uski hydrogen aayan sandratha ucchtam hoti he or falat: pi ech nimnatam hota he
 As interchangeable ions such as sodium calcium are added to the soil, its ph increases
 mitti kaa ucchtam pi ech lagbhag 11 tak pahunch jaataa he
 In actual field conditions, some more ph has been observed, but the cause is not interchangeable cations, but rather soluble salts such as sodium carbonate, which are normally present in alkaline soils
 aise lavenon kaa ek nishchit seemaa se adhik hona fasalon kii vruddhi ko roktaa he
 But having sodium carbonate in soil is beneficial for engineering structure
 in lavenon kii upasthiti mitti kaa sodium mitti main parinat karti he, jo saadhan avasthaa main calcium mitti se adhik jal pratirodh karti he
 As a result, soil strength remains in moist condition, which is necessary for engineering structure
 nisarg bhoomi ke teen pramukh avyav hai, ret, silt or mitti
 Not only are there differences in the size of their particles, their chemical and physical properties are also different
 ret saadharantaya silica or sphatik kii bani hoti he
 Silica and crystalline are inert
 ret kaa aakaar 0
06 mimi0 se 2 mimi0 tak hota he
 Sand particles do not have cohesion and capillarity, but permeability is high
 silt ke ghatak silica or sphatik hi hai, kintu iske kanon kaa aakaar 0
0002 mimi0 se 0
06 mimi0 tak hota he
 Silt particles do not have fusion, but capillarity is considerable
 mitti ke kanon kaa aakaar 0
002 mimi0 se kam hota he
 Its dissimilarity with sand and silt is that clay particles react with chemicals due to chemical ingestion
 mitti kii adhikta se bhoomi main keshikatv tathaa sansanjan aata he
 Such a land swells when wet and shrinks when it dries
 mitti ke in spasht bhautik gunon kaa kaaran usamen kolyd kanon kii ucch pratishtata he, jisase hydrogen, sodium, calcium, potacium, magnesium aadi ke ayan prishth se adhishoshit hote hai
 These ions are interchangeable, meaning they are replaceable with other ions in the solution
 in ayanon ko adhishoshit karne kii ucchtam kshamta ko kshar kii vinimay dharita kehete hai
 The base of anions will be equally high
 mitti ke gun prishth par adhishoshit dhanayan par nirbhar karte hai
 The chemical components of different soils are the same, that is, in quantity, with,, and water, but different soils have different mineral compounds
 anek vaigyanikon ke eks kiran tathaa sajaateey shail vishleshan anek vaigyanikon ke eks kiran tathaa sajaateey shail vishleshan sambandhi prayogon ke falswaroop mitti khanij ke do samooh nishchit hue hen
 The basis of classification is the texture of the crystal lattice
 dekhen - chini mitti The minerals in this group are made up of sheets of silica and alumina
 is samooh ke khanij ke crystal jaalak do ikai silica chadar or ek ikai alumina chadar se bane hote hai
 Due to the variation of crystal lattice structure, there is a great difference in the chemical and physical properties of the soils of these two groups
 keolin khanij kii kshar vinium dharita nimna or uskaa adhishoshan gun bhi kam hota he, jab ki maantmarilonite khanij kaa dhanayan-adhishoshan hota he
 The predominant cotton black soil in the soil groups of India, which is often dominated by the whole of central and south India, belongs to the montmalonite group
 iskaa mukhya gun sikudna tathaa failana he, jo bhawan tathaa sadak nirmaan kii samasya he
 The discovery of this place has proved that the reaction of coarse lime reduces the lot of soil
 chir yovvan praapt karne ke liye ashwinimudra istemaal kar sakate he
 Pranayama can be termed as the all available nectar
 is brahmad main sahaj-sulabh hokar sirf laabhakaari hone kii koi kriya yoga main he to vah he pranayam
 With its constant use, increase of physical energy, enhancement of disease resistance, spiritual feeling, cessation of mental disorders etc
 Many benefits can be obtained from this boon of nature
 is yogic kriya main aavashyaktaa sirf samay va lagan kii rahati he, jisaki jarurat bhi saamanytah prarambh main hi adhik hoti he
 After some time, the knowledge and experience of its benefits leave such an impact on the one who does it, that then the mind of not doing it is not possible except as an indicator of divine wrath or misfortune
 pranayam kii anek vidhiyaan hai
 In the process of doing this simple and easy method, a person willing to sit in a cool and ventilated place, sitting in an east or north direction, should sit
 dhyaan rahe ki asana plastic kaa nahin ho tathaa kriya karne ke lagbhag do ghante purv tak kuch khaaya nahin ho evam 30 minute purv tak kuch piya nahin ho
 While sitting, the spine is straight and there is no tension in the entire body
 vastra suvidhajanak va deele-dhaale hona chahie
 In this situation, close both eyes and start focusing on your breath
 dhire-dhire man main shwaas chaar baar '' man main bolkar athwa kisi bhi isht kaa naam lekar andar bharen
 After coming in, keep breathing twice as long as taking 8 times '8' or taking any name
 rokane se dugane samay arthath 16 baar '' athwa naam jitne samay tak shwaas ko dhire-dhire chhodte jaaen
 In this process, this process should be done in order to prevent double time from breathing and to leave double time from it, thus from the period of growth
 din-pratidin isamen samay kii vruddhi karne evam pranayam kii maatra bhi badhanaa chahie
 For a normal person, doing this activity till the age of his age is added to 5 years
 jaise yadi avasthaa 35 varsh kii ho to kriya 35+40 baar tak karnaa chahie
 With this, its benefits start getting

 Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd is a British manufacturer of luxury sports cars, based in Gaydon, Warwickshire
 company kaa naam is company ke sansthaapakon main se ek, linel martin, ke naam se or buckinghamashair main eston clinton ke paas eston hill speed hilaklimb se liya gaya he
 From 1994 to 2007, Eston was part of the Martin Ford Motor Company, which became part of the company's Premier Automotive Group in 2000

 eston martin kii sthapana 1913 main linel martin or robert bamford ne kii thi
 The duo laid the foundation for their joint strength as Bamford & Martin to sell last year's cars made by Singer from the premises of Callow Street, London, where they also serviced GWK and Calthorp vehicles
 martin, eston clinton ke paas eston hill par vishesh prakaar ke res lagaate the or donon ne apane khud ke vaahanon kaa nirmaan karne kaa faisla kiya
 The first car to be named as Aston Martin was manufactured by Martin in a 1908 isota-fraschini chassis with a four-cylinder Coventry-simplex engine
 unhone kencington kencington ke henikar place main ek parisar ko adhigrihith kiya or march 1915 main apni pehali car kaa nirmaan kiya
 Due to the outbreak of World War I, production could not begin and Martin Admiralty and Bamford joined the Royal Army Service Corps
 sabhi kal-purjon ko sopvith aviation company ko bech diya gaya
 After the war, the company was restored at Abingdon Road in Kensington and designed a new car bearing the name of aston-martin

 Since time immemorial, it has been believed that according to the thoughts that a person has at the time of dying, his soul is insecure after his daily life, so at the time of death one should leave the worldly fascination and remember Hari or Shiva and mind

 It has come there that the power of thought keeps the soul higher, so that the human-mind should be aware that all the material substances or manifestations in the whole universe are all one and they have the same variety
 bhagavadgita ne yahi bhaavana or adhik spasht rup se vyakt kii he-'vah vyakti, jo antkaal main mujhe samaran karata hua is jivan se vidaa hota he, vah mere paas aata he, isamen sanshay nahin he'
 But one thing to remember is that nothing will happen in the end only by remembering God, when the soul is overwhelmed with such emotion throughout life, then only God attains God
 aisa kaha gaya he-'vyakti mrityu ke samay jo bhi rup sochataa he, usee ko vah praapt hota he or yah tabhi sambhav he, jabaki vah jivan bhar aisa karata aayaa ho
 ' puraanon ke aadhaar par kuch nibandhon kaa aisa kathan he ki antkaal upasthit hone par vyakti ko, yadi sambhav ho to, kisi tirth-sthaan main le janaa chahie
 Shuddhittattva has quoted the Korampurana - 'A person attains salvation by dying in the waters of the Ganges, in the site or waters of Varanasi, in the Gangasagar or in its land, water or space
 ' isi arth main skandapurana main aayaa he-'ganga ke taton se ek gavyuti tak kshetra hota he, itani dur tak daan, jap evam home karne se ganga kaa hi fal praapt hota he; jo is kshetra main marataa he, vah swarg jaataa he or pun: janm nahin paata'
 He has come to Pujratnakar - 'where the Shalgramshila is there, Hari resides there; One who dies near Shalagramashila receives the supreme sacrifice of Hari
 ' aisa bhi kaha gaya he ki yadi koi anarya desh main bhi shalagram se ek kos kii duuri par marataa he, vah vaikuntha paata he
 Similarly, a person who dies in the forest of Tulsi or at the time of death in whose face Tulsidal gets Mokshapad even after committing crores of sins

 There are some assumptions about the best period of death
 shaantiparv main aayaa he- 'jo vyakti surya ke uttar disha main jane par marataa he yaa kisi anya shubh nakshatra evam muhoort main marataa he, vah sachmuch punyavan he
 'this sentiment is based on the notion of dying in Uttarayan and Dakshinayan expressed in the Upanishads
 chaandogopenishad main aayaa he- 'ab chaahe log uski antyeshti kriya karen yaa na karen, vah archi: arthath prakaash ko praapt hota he, prakaash se din, din se chandra ke ardh prakaash, usase uttarayan ke chha: maas, usase varsh, varsh se surya, surya se chandra, chandra se vidyut ko praapt hota he
 Amanav leads him to Brahm
 yah devon kaa maarg he; vah maarg, jisase brahm kii prapti hoti he
 Those who go this route do not return to human life again
 haan, ve nahin lautate
 'the same thing has come in the Chandogyopanishad, where it has been said that the householder who knows Panchagni-gya and also the Vanaprastha and Parivrajaka who believe and meditate, also go to Devayana
 or jo log gramvasi hai, yagyaparayan hai, daan-dakshinayukta hai, dhooma ko jate hai, ve dhooma se raatri, raatri se chandra ke ardh andhkaar main, usase dakshinyan ke chha: maas, usase pitrulok, usase akaash evam chandra ko jate hai, jahaan ve karmfal pate hai or pun: usee maarg se laut aate hai
 The Chandogyopanishad has indicated a third place, where insects and kites etc
 keep coming
 brihadaaranyakopenishad ne bhi devloag, pitrulok evam us lok kaa ullekh kiya he, jahaan keet, patang aadi jate hai
 The Bhagavad Gita has also said these words of the Upanishads in a subtle way - i will describe those times when devotees depart from this world to never return
 agni, jyoti, din, shukla paksh, uttarayan surya ke chha:; jab brahmagyani in kaalon main marate hai, to brahmalok jate hai
 Devotees who die in six months of Dhoom, night, Krishna Paksha, Dakshinayan Sun, go to Chandralok and return again
 is vishay main ye do maarg, jo prakaashmaan evam andhakaarmay hai, sanathan hai
 One who returns from one never returns, but one who comes from another returns
 veydantasutra ne 'prakaash', 'din' aadi shabdon ko yathashrut shabdic arth main lene ko nahin kaha he; arthath uske mat se ye margon ke lakshan yaa str nahin hai, pratyut ye un devataaon ke pratik hai, jo mritatmaon ko sahaayta dete hai or devloak evam pitrulok ke margon main unhen le jate hai, arthath ve aativaahik evam abhimaani devtaa hai
 Shankar has explained in the interpretation of Vedantasutra that when Bhishma recited Uttarayana, it should be understood from this that there is only praise for Archiradi - the one who is a Brahmistra, even if he dies in Dakshinayan, he gets the fruit of his knowledge, That is, one attains Brahm
 jab bhishma ne uttarayan kii baat johi to aisa karke unhone keval lokprasiddh prayog yaa aacharan ko manyata di or unhone yah bhi prakat kiya ki unamem yah shakti bhi thi ki ve apni ichhashakti se hi mar sakate hai, kyonki unke pita ne unhen aisa var de rakhaa tha
 Despite the words of Shankar and Vedantasutra, it has been a well-known thing that it is better to die in Uttarayana
 antyeshti ek sanskaar he
 It is one of the sixteen or more rituals performed by the Dwijs and is performed with Vedic mantras by the views of Manu, Yajnavalkyasmriti and Jatukarnya
 ye sanskaar pehle striyon ke liye bhi hote the, kintu bina vaidic mantron ke or shudron ke liye bhi bina vaidic mantron ke
 Baudhayana Pitrimedhasutra states that there are two rites of credit for every human being and they are the birth rites and the deceased rites
 dah sanskaar tathaa shraadh aadi aahitagni evam smartagni ke liye bhinn-bhinn ritiyon se hote hai, tathaa un logon ke liye bhi jo shrout yaa smart koi agni nahin rakhte
 One who is a woman, a child, a parivrajak, one who dies in a distant country, one who dies prematurely or commits suicide or dies accidentally; Funeral acts for them are of different types
 ek hi vishay kii krity-vidhiyon main shrautasutra evam grihyasutra vibhinn baaten kehete hai or aage chalakar madhya evam pashchaatyakalin yugon yugon main vidhiyaan or bhi vistrut hoti chali gayi hai
 Decision Sindhu has clearly stated that, the funeral is mentioned differently in each branch, but some things are same in all branches
 anty-karmon ke vistaar, abhaav evam upasthiti ke aadhaar par sutron, smritiyon, puraanon evam nibandhon ke kaal-kram-sambandhi nishkarsh nikaale gayi hai, kintu ye nishkarsh bahudhaa anumaanon evam vaiyaktik bhaawanaaon par hi aadhaarit hai
 The five Suktas of the Rigveda are translated as follows before the Shrutasutras, Grihyasutras and the later deeds mentioned in the later texts
 in sookhton kii richaayen bahudhaa sabhi sutron dwaara prayukt hui hai or unka prayog aaj bhi antyeshti ke samay hota he or unamem adhikansh vaidic samhitaon main bhi paayi jaati hai
 Indian and Western commentators have interpreted and interpreted these mantras in various ways
 rugveda main pratham sookt kaa varnan is prakaar he- The description of the second sukta in the Rigveda is as follows - rugveda main tritiy sookt kaa varnan is prakaar he- The description of the fourth sukta in the Rigveda is as follows - Except for three to six mantras of this sukta, other mantras do not throw light on the funeral, so we will translate only four mantras

 "sarvavijna pusha, jo pashuon ko nasht nahin hone detaa or vishwa kii raksha karata he, tumhen is lok se bheje
 May he subject you to these fathers and let the fire subordinate you to the Gods who know you
 4
 vah pusha jo is vishwa kaa jivan he, jo swayan jivan he, tumhaari raksha kare
 May those who have gone ahead of you protect you on the way
 savita dev tumhen vahaan pratishthapit kare, jahaan sundar karm karne vaale jaakar nivas karte hai
 5
 Pusha knows all these directions in sequence
 vah hamen us maarg se le chale, jo bhay se rahit he
 He is prosperous, bright, with all the mighty men; That science grew ahead of us without any errors
 6
 pusha margon ke sammukh sthit he, vah swarg ko jane vaale margon or pruthivi ke margon par khadaa he
 He loves us, he is standing in front of both worlds and he keeps on going in both worlds
 " The description of the fifth Sukta in the Rigveda is as follows- yah avlokaneey he ki 'pitru-yajna' shabd rugveda main aayaa he
 What does this mean? We have to remember that the verses of the Rigveda indicate the acts of a person after death
 unka sambandh purvapurushon kii shraadh-kriyaaon se nahin he
 The eagerness to express affection for the immediate martyr must have been expressed to the forefathers, who have been called Barhishads: and Agniswat
 purvapurushon ko 'havi:' diya gaya he or ve use grahan karte hai, aisa pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The purpose of the above mentioned Rigvedic mantras is different from the purpose of the mantras given in the Taittiriya Samhita
 yah baat thik he ki taittiriya samhita ke teen mantra rugveda ke hai or ve pind-pitruyajna main prayukt hote hai
 But there is no argument to say that the Rigveda's 'pitra Yajna' is more ancient than pind-pitragya
 yah sambhav he ki ye donon vibhinn baton kii ore sanket karte hue samakalik prachlan ke hi dyotak hon
 The acts which took place after the death of the person initiated for the Somayagya or session are described in the Assavalayana Srutasutra
 isamen aayaa he-"jab dikshit mar jaataa he, to uske sharir ko ve tirth se le jate hai, use us sthaan par rakhte hai, jahaan avbhruth hone vaala tha or use un alankaranon se sajaate hai, jo bahudhaa shav par rakhe jate hai
 They cut the head, face and body hair and nails of the body
 ve nald kaa lep lagaate hai or shav par naldon kaa haar chadhaate hai
 Some people cut the intestines and remove stool from them and fill the background with them
 ve shav ke paanv ke baraabar naveen vastra kaa ek tukdaa kaat lete hai or usase shav ko is prakaar dhank dete hai ki anchal pashchim disha main pad jaataa he or shav ke paanv khule rahete hai
 Son, etc
 take the price of a piece of cloth
 shav ke vastra ko 'shav vastram' yaa 'shav aachhadanam' kehete hai jise bolchaal kii bhashaa main 'kafan' kehete hai
 The dead fire of the dead is placed on the aranis, the dead body is brought out of the altar and taken to the south, fire is produced by friction and the body is burnt in it
 shmashaan se lautne par unhen din kaa kaary samaapt karnaa chahie
 On the second morning, recitation of weapons, singing of hymns and singing of prostrations is done without repeating and without chanting 'him'
 usee din purohit log grahon ko lene ke purv tirthon se aate hai, daahine haath ko unchaa karke shmashaan kii parikrama karte hai or nimna prakaar se uske chaturdik baith jate hai; hota shmashaan ke pashchim main, adhvaryu uttar main, adgaata adhvaryu ke pashchim or brahma dakshin main
 After this, sing the mantra starting with 'aayin Gau: Pashishnirakramit' in a slow voice
 gayan samaapt hone ke uparant hota apane baayen haath ko shmashaan kii ore karke shmashaan kii teen parikrama karata he or bina 'om' kaa uccharan kiye udgaata ke gayan turant pashchaat dhimen swar main stotriy kaa paath karata he or nimna mantron ko, jo yama evam yamyyanon ke mantra hai, kahata he; yatha-rugveda
 They should end with the Rigveda and after that collect the ashes in a pitcher, take the pitcher from the side of the pilgrimage and place it on the pedestal where the dead Yejman used to sit
 shankhayan shrautasutra ne aahitagni kii antyeshti-kriya ke vishay main vistaar ke saath likhaa he
 Katyayana Shrutasutra has said the same things in a nutshell
 katyayan shrautasutra ne kesh evam nakh kaatane evam mel padaarth nikaal dene kii charchaa kii he
 Kaushikasutra and Shankhayana Shrutasutra have also alluded to these things and have added so much that if they cut the bones out of the right side, then they sew them again or they only bathe the body, Cover with a cloth, decorate it, put it on the bed, on which the black antelope rests, place a garland of Nalad on it, and cover it with a new cloth
 satyasarh shrautasutra evam gautamapitrumedhasutra main bhi aisi baaten di hui hai or yah bhi he ki shav ke haath evam pair ke anguthe shwet sutron yaa vastra ke anchal bhaag se band diye jate hai or asandi udumbar lakdi kii bani hoti he
 Kaushikasutra mentions many mantras of the Atharvaveda, which are said to burn the pyre and while offering Hava
 shatapath brahman kaa kathan he ki pathar evam mitti ke bane yajna-paatr kisi brahman ko daan de dene chahie, kintu log mitti ke paatro ko shavvaahan samajhate hai, at: unhen jal main phenk dena chahie
 After removing the vapors of the strings, one should cover the mouth and head of the deceased and while doing this, recite 'agnarvarm'
 pashu ke donon vrikk nikaalkar mrit ke haathon main rakh dene chahie-dahinaa vrikk daahine haath main or bayen baayen haath main-or 'atidrav' kaa keval ek baar paath karnaa chahie
 He places the heart of the animal on the heart of the corpse, with the opinion of some people also holds two pieces of rice or barley flour
 katyayan shrautasutra ke anusaar anustarani pashu ko kaan ke paas ghayal karke maaraa jaataa he
 By the opinion of Jatukarnya, parts of the same parts of the animal are kept on different parts of the body
 kintu katyayan ise nahin maanate, kyonki aisa karne par jalaane ke pashchaat asthiyon ko ekatra karte samay pashu kii asthiyaan bhi ekatra ho jaayengi, at: unke mat se keval maance bhaag hi shav ke angon main lagaana chahie
 The Shatapatha Brahmin Ashlavayanagrihyasutra states that the animal is exercised by choice, that is, either the animal can be cut or released or given to a Brahmin
 shankhayanshrautasutra kaa kathan he ki maare gayi yaa jivit pashu ke donon vrikk peeche se nikaalkar dakshin agni main thodaa garm karke mrit ke donon haathon main rakh dene chahie or 'atidrav' kaa paath karnaa chahie
 He cuts the same part of the animal on the body of the dead body and again covers the body with its skin and recites the call of 'imam Agne' while carrying the water of Pranitha forward

 is vishay main aahitagniyon ke liye ashauch 10 dinon tak tathaa anya logon ke liye keval 3 dinon tak hota he
 In the Satyasadha Shrutasutra, Boudhayan Pitrimedasutra and Garuda Purana, such a system has been given that if a person who has gone abroad returns after shaping, that is, a person who is deemed dead returns to a living state, he is taken out by dipping in a pool filled with melted butter; He is given a bath again and all rites are performed from caste work
 iske uparant usko apni patni ke saath pun: vivaah karnaa hota he, kintu yadi uski patni mar gayi he to vah duusari kanya se vivaah kar saktaa he or tab vah pun: agnihotra armbh kar saktaa he
 Some sources have provided that if Ahitagni's wife dies before he can, he can either burn it with shroteagni or keep it in a fire filled with cow dung or in three thalias, soon by the fire produced by the burning weeds
 Can burn manusmriti kaa kathan he ki yadi aahitagni dwij kii savarna evam sadaacharini patni mar jaye to aahitagni pati apni shrout evam smart agniyon se use yajyapatro ke saath jala saktaa he

 This theory is opposed to the views of other commentators, but he has taken the 'savarna' used in Manusmriti as an example only because not doing so will lead to sentence discrimination
 at: brahman patni ke atirikt kshatriya patni ko bhi manyata di gai he
 Some memories have written that Ahitagni can perform his Agnihotra even in a widower form and perform Yajnadi by making a wife's gold or Kush statue, as Rama did
 jab grihasth apni mul patni ko shrautagniyon ke saath jalaane ke uparant pun: vivaah nahin karata he or na pun: naveen vaidic agniyaan rakhata he to vah marane ke uparant saadhaaran agniyon se hi jalaayaa jaataa he

 keval sadaacharini evam pativrata stri kaa dah-karm shrout yaa smart agni se hota he
 According to Ritu and Baudhayana Pitrumedhasutra, the widow and widow are cremated by the fire called kapal, the brahmachari and the Yeti is born from the fire, the virgin girl and the unborn boy are born from the straw
 yadi aahitagni patit ho jaae yaa kisi prakaar se aatmahatya kar le yaa pashuon yaa sarpon se bhidakar mar jaae to uski shrautagniyaan jal main phenk deni chahie, smart agniyaan chauraahey yaa jal main phenk deni chahie, yajyapatro ko jala daalana chahie or use saadhaaran agni se jalaana chahie
 Manusmriti, Yajnavalkyasamriti, Parasramadhaviya, Vishnu Dharmasutra, Brahmapuran should cover the womb, fetus, dead baby and toothless infant covered with cloth
 choti avasthaa ke bacchon ko nahin jalaana chahie, kintu is vishay main pracheen smritiyon main avasthaa sambandhi vibhed paaya jaataa he
 Parskar Grihyasutra, Yajnavalkyasmriti, Manusmriti, Yama etc
 have arranged that children within the year should be buried outside the village in a clean place away from the crematorium
 aise bacchon ke shavon par ghrit kaa lep karnaa chahie, un par chandanalep, pushp aadi rakhane chahie, na to unhen jalaana chahie or na jal-tarpan karnaa chahie or na unka asthi-chayan karnaa chahie
 Relatives cannot go together
 yama ne yamasookt ke paath evam yama ke sammaan main stutipth karne kii vyavastha di he
 Manusmriti has given some alternative arrangements, such as watering can be done for children with teeth or naming-sanskrit children, ie there can be cremation of such children
 at: do varsh se kam avasthaa ke bacchon kii antyeshti ke vishay main vikalp he, arthath namakaran evam daant nikalne ke uparant aise bachche jalaaye yaa gaade ja sakate hai
 But in doing this it is not necessary to go with all the dead bodies
 yadi baccha do varsh kaa ho yaa yadi adhik avasthaa kaa ho, kintu abhi upanayan sanskaar nahin hua ho to uskaa dahakarm loukik agni se avashya hona chahie or maun rup se jala dena chahie
 Chudakaran with the opinion of Laugakhi - Sanskrit children should have the same kind of funeral
 vaikhansasmartasutra ne kaha he ki 5 varsh ke ladke tathaa 7 varsh kii ladki kaa dahakarm nahin hota
 After Upanayana, there is cremation like Ahitagni, but Yajnapatras do not have right and mantra
 boudhayanpitrumedhasutra ne vyavastha di he ki chudaakaran ke purv mrit bacchon kaa shavadah nahin hota, kumari kanyaon evam upanayan rahit ladakon kaa pitrumedh nahin hota
 He has also arranged that children without teeth are buried with 'om' and children with teeth are buried with vyahtriyas
 mitakshra ne niyamon ko nimna rup se diya he-'namakaran ke purv keval gaada jaataa he, jal-tarpan nahin hota; namakaran ke uparant teen varsh tak gaadna yaa jalaana vikalp se hota he; teen varsh se upanayan ke purv tak shavadah evam tarpan maun rup se hota he; yadi teen varsh ke purv chudaakaran ho gaya ho to marane par yahi niyam lagu hota he
 After the Upanayana, the cremation of the dead is done by temporal fire, but the manner is the same as that prescribed for Ahitagni

 hinduon main vibhinn avasaron par kii jane vaali parmparik puja-richa kaa kriyaatmak rup karmkand kehalaata he
 Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya has given the importance and justification of rituals in a book, while some scholars like Vrindavanastha Pandit Vijay Prakash Shastri, according to some scholars, describe the three rituals in the Veda - Upasanakand and Jnanakanda
 veda ke kul ek lakh mantra hai- chaar hajaar gyaan cond ke, solah hajaar upasna cond ke or sabase zyada assi hajaar karmkand ke hai
 Therefore rituals occupy prime position
 is prakaar veda ke teen bhaag hai
 "three Scandal Unity Shan - Veda
 veda ke karmkand bhaag main yagyadi vividh anushthanon kaa vishesh rup se varnan miltaa he atah yajna karmkand hi vedon kaa mukhya vishay he
 Mantras are used in rituals, being the main subject of the Vedas
 veda mantron ke bina karmkand nahin ho saktaa or karmkand ke bina mantron kaa thik-thik sadupyog nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, it is clear that Vedas are rituals and rituals are Vedas
 vishnu dharmottar puraana main varnan aata he vedastu yagnarth mabhipravritah
 With this promise and God Manu's Dudoh Yajna Siddhayami 1 / 23, it is clear from this sentence that the Vedas originated for ritual, yagna, ritual
 jis prakaar veda duruh hai usee prakaar vedang bhoot karmkand bhi atyant duruh he
 Just as there are worshiped deities in the Veda, similarly in rituals, there are also deities worshiped
 jis prakaar veda upasya veda kisi purush ke dwaara na banaaya hua
 The description comes in the eternal and eternal - Parashar Smriti
 nakshchidved c vedasamanrta chaturmukhah
 Nākshidevādaकर्ताa ch Veda Smarta Chaturmukh
 
 There is no one to create the Veda
 chaturmukh brahma ne veda kaa samaran kiya
 In the same way, yajna rituals, rituals are also apaurusiy, routine and eternal
 rugveda ke pratham mantra ‘agnimide purohitam’’ main yajna pad aayaa he atah siddh hota he ki veda se bhi pracheen karmkand he
 The ritual is a staple of Vedic culture
 karmkand se hi samast manushyon kii kaamanaayen siddh hoti hai
 The ritual, fulfills the desired desire and well-being of human beings and temporal happiness-peace and many desires that are determined in the mind
 hamaare dharmacharyon ne manushya ke liye jitne bhi dharm kahe hai ve sabhi karmkand lakshan se sanyukt hai| pracheen rishi maharishiyon ne shastron ke anusaar hi apana jivan yajiumay banaaya tha
 He used to do welfare of himself and the world through sacrificial rituals
 vastutah karmkand main apurv shakti he
 'the ritual which one wishes to attain, he gives the same thing to him
 ' ‘‘yo yadichchhati tasya tat’’
 12 / 16 So it is clear that there is no such thing in the world that cannot be attained through rituals
 karmkand se keval loukik, dhanadhanya, santati aadi vastuon kii hi nahin apitu parloukik ‘moksh’ aadi padaarthon kii bhi prapti hoti he
 The laws of this superior karma are also very difficult
 karmkand ke teen vishesh ang he

 Concentrated acid draws water from organic materials, wood and animal tissues, which results in the decomposition of organic materials and the cuckoo as a residue
 gandhakaml lavan banaata he, jise salphet kehete hai
 Sulfates are common or neutral salts, such as normal sodium sulfate or acidic sodium bisulfate
 amleey isliye ki isamen ab bhi ek hydrogen rahata he, jo ksharakon se pratisthapit ho saktaa he
 Sulphates are formed by the action of acids on metals, metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or other salts
 adhikansh sulphate jalaviley hote hai
 Only calcium, barium, strontium, and sis salts are insoluble or very soluble in water
 anek lavan audyogic mahatv ke hai
 Barium and sis sulfate are used as pigments, sodium sulfate is used in paper manufacture, copper sulfate as a pesticide, and calcium sulfate as a plaster of Paris
 sis or ispaat par sandra amla kii koi kriya nahin hoti
 Therefore, Sis and steel vessels are used in the manufacture of acids and for keeping acids
 prayogshaalaon main nimnaankit teen ritiyon se alp maatra main gandhakaml taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he : By dissolving sulfur trixide in water, hydrogen paroxide tathaa sulfur dioxide kii sidhi kriya se- By the slow oxidation of a solution of sulfuric acid in the air
 audyogic str par sis-kaksh-vidhi tathaa sansparsh vidhi se amla kaa utpaadan hota he
 In the contact method, sulfur dioxide is first formed by the combustion of sulfur, such as sulfur or iron sulfide, and is converted into sulfur dioxide by the oxygenation of air in the presence of a platinum metallic asbestos catalyst, which dissolves in water to form sulfur
 is vidhi main jal kii upasthiti main nitric amla dwaara sulfur dioxide ke oxikaran se amla banataa he
 This action takes place in large Sis chambers, hence its name is 'sis-chamber-method'
 is vidhi kaa upyog baari maatra main salphuric amla banane ke liye hota tha, kintu isaki kuch kamiyaan hai jiske kaaran ab iskaa sthaan sansparsh prakram ne le liya he
 The first factory to manufacture Gandhakamal on a large scale was established in 1740 AD in Richmond near London by a scientist named Ward
 nirmaan ke liye gandhak tathaa shore ke mishran ko lohe ke paatr main garam kiya jaataa tha or amla ke vaashp ko kaanch ke paatro main jinamein jal bharaa rahata tha, ekatra kiya jaataa tha
 The dilute acid obtained in this way was concentrated in glass containers above the sand boiler
 kuch samay pashchaat sheeghra tuutanevaale kaanch ke paatro ke sthaan par chah foot chaude sis kakshon kaa prayog hone laga
 In 1810, the use of modern seashell method started by the hard work of a scientist named Holker
 1818 i
 se gandhak dwizarkik kii prapti ke liye kachche maal gandhak ke sthaan par pirietiess naamak khanij kaa prayog hone laga
 The Sise-chamber method was modernized by the development of the gay-lupac Pillar in 1827 AD and the Globar Pillar in 1859 AD
 yahan nitrogen ke oxide, gandhak dwizarkik tathaa vaayu ko kaksh main pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 Such a gas mixture is injected into the 25-foot-high Glover column from below
 is stambh main upar se ge-lusac stambh kaa gandhakaml tathaa nitrosil gandhakaml kaa mishran tapakataa he
 The gas mixture enters the sis chamber after exiting the column
 saadharantaya sis kaksh teen rahete hai
 Here steam also enters the chamber
 gas mishran or bhaap ke bich kriya hokar, gandhakaml banakar, kaksh ke pende main ikattha hota he
 The residual gases now enter the gay-lussac column
 inamen pradhanthya nitrogen ke oxide rahete hai
 The gay-lussac column is filled with pieces of coke or stone
 usamen upar se gandhakaml tapakataa he or rukaawat ke kaaran dhire-dhire girakar, nitrogen ke oxidon ko avashoshit kar, nitrosil gandhakaml banataa he or glover stambh main prayukt hota he
 In this way, the loss of nitrogen oxides is saved
 sis kaksh se praapt amla ashuddh hota he
 The impurities contain arsonic, nitrogen oxides and some salts
 aisa amla pradhanthya urvarak ke nirmaan main prayukt hota he
 Pure acid is not necessary for this
 aisa amla sasta hota he
 Another method of manufacturing sulfur acid is the contact method
 is vidhi se praapt amla adhik shuddh or sandra hota he
 It was developed by a scientist named Nitz in 1889–90 AD
 germany kii badishche anilin and soda fabric company ne is vidhi se sarvapratham amla taiyaar kiya, at: ise badishche vidhi, athwa badishche prakram bhi kehete hai
 Most of the world's sulfuricides are manufactured nowadays by contact method
 isse kisi bhi sandran kaa amla praapt ho saktaa he
 In this method, sulfur is obtained by burning sulfur, or by acquiring pyrites
 ise vaayu ke saath milakar utprerak par le laayaa jaataa he, jahaan gandhak dwizarkik vaayu ke oxigen se sanyukt hokar gandhak trioxide banataa he
 "oleum" is obtained by absorbing sulfur trioxide into the concentrated sulfur
 olium kii jal ke saath kriya se vaanchit sandratha ke amla ko praapt kiya jaataa he
 First microdivided platinum was used as a catalyst
 yah bahut mahanga padataa tha
 When vanadium pentoxide is used in place of platinum, it is much cheaper than platinum
 utprerak kii kriyasheeltaa kam na ho jaae, iske liye aavashyak he ki sulfur dioxide arsenic, raakh tathaa dhul kanon se bilkul mukt ho
 Hence, the sulfur is arranged for filtering the bifurcation and it is passed through such substances in which arsenic is completely released
 yadi gas ko shuddh na kar liya jaae, to utprerak kii kaaryashiltaa jald nasht ho sakati he
 The gases that enter the catalytic chamber contain sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen
 urdhwadhar paatro main utprerak rakhaa rahata he
 The gas released there is absorbed into the concentrated sulfuric acid
 isse olium praapt hota he
 Up to 40 percent more sulfur in the oleum can be absorbed in addition to 100 per cent of sulfur
 aavashyak maatra main pani daalkar, isse vaanchit sandratha kaa amla praapt kar sakate hai
 Several acid manufacturing plants have been made by contact method, which can give more pure and less expensive acid
 aise sanyantr ab bane hai jinamein 24 ghante main 600 ton amla taiyaar ho sake
 Few people are sufficient to take care of them
 prati ton amla ke liye ek ton se adhik unchi daab vaali samprukt bhaap, yaa ati tapt bhaap, kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 To obtain 100 acid per tonne requires 35 kilowatts of electricity and 4,000 gallons of cold water
 lasabela yaa las bela pakistan ke balochistan praant kaa ek tatavarti zila he
 It is called Las Belo in Sindhi accent
 yah 30 june 1954 ko us samay ke kalaat vibhaag ke andar ek alag zile ke rup main gathit kiya gaya tha
 The district consists of 9 tehsils and 21 federal councils
 lasabela main baloch logon or sindhi logon kaa ek mishran rahata he
 The Jamot community of Sindhis is in large numbers here
 jamot ek rajput samudaay he jo swayan ko sammaan rajvansh kaa vanshaj samajhataa he
 Almost all people are Muslim although a small Hindu community also exists
 yahan ke sindhi ek 'lasi' naamak sindhi upbhasha bolte hai jo maanak sindhi bhashaa se thodi alag he
 If the coastal route to Makran is adopted between the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, Lasbella falls on it
 sikandar mahaan jab pashchimottar bharat par qabza karne ke baad babilon laut rahaa tha to lasabela se guzara tha
 In 711 AD, Muhammad bin Qasim, the warlord of Umayyad Khilafat, also came out of Lasbela to attack Sindh
 bharat kii azaadi or vibhaajan se pehle las bela british raaj ke prashasan main ek alag riyasat hua karti thi jiskaa shaasha jamot samudaay kaa tha or 'jam' kii oopaadhi rakhata tha
 After independence, it was merged with Pakistan in 1954–1955
