 There is no authentic history or history of the origin of insurance, but from various narratives it can be concluded that insurance originated with the development of civilization in ancient times
 pehle sanyukt parivaar pratha bhi beemaa kaa hi ek swaroop tha yadi parivaar main koi mar jaataa, aapng ho jaataa, berozegaar ho ja us vyakti ko uski patni va bacchon kii dekhbhaal parivaar ke anya log karte, parantu vartmaan main yah vyavastha vighatit hone se bime kii aavashyaktaa utpann hone lagi
 The emergence of life insurance is also considered to be BC
 rome ke log jivan beemaa se parichit the parantu aadhunik swaroop kaa prarambh 1583 ko hi hua jabaki landan ke shri wiliam gibbans ke jivan kaa ek varsh kaa beemaa kiya gaya
 It is said that Mesopotamia and Babylon started insurance for the first time in 3000 years ago
 aadhunik beemaa kaa vikaas 13veen shatabdi main hua mana jaataa he
 In the ancient times, the movement of goods with foreign countries was mostly by sea, which was fraught with many risks
 in jokhimon se bachaav hetu vyapaaree ek samjhauta kar lete the ki maarg main hone vaali haani ko vyapaaree hiton ke anusaar baant lenge isi prakaar rin dene kii pratha bhi thi jise bautmari bond kaha jaataa he
 Thus maritime insurance first and then fire insurance developed
 edrcd lid naamak kaaphi vikreta ne landan main samudri beemaa ko aadhunik rup pradaan kiya
 In the Great Fire of London in 1666 in which 13000 houses were burnt down, insurance was promoted and in 1680 the first fire insurance company named 'fire Office' was Shri Ganesh
 bharat main samudri evam agni beemaa kaa vartmaan swaroop england se aayaa he
 Life insurance started in India in 1818 with the establishment of 'oriental Life Insurance Company' in Calcutta
 1823, 1829, 1847 main bhi anya companiyaan sthapit hui
 In 1850, Triton Insurance Company Limited in Calcutta for general insurance business
 Was established
 1871 main bombai mutual life esorance socity” naamak bhartiya sanstha kii sthapana kii gai jo saamaanya premium daron par bharatiyon kaa beemaa karne lagi
 Later also in 1912, 1928 other acts were made
 parantu 1938 main sabhi adhiniyamon ko ekikrut karke beemaa niyaman hetu ek beemaa adhinium banaaya gaya In 1907 Indian Mercantile Insurance Company Ltd
 Established in Mumbai which first started fire insurance
 phir is kshetra main kai bhartiya va videshi sansthaanon ne kaary karnaa prarambh kiya
 The Insurance Act 1938 was enacted in India to regulate and control the functioning of these institutions
 isi prakaar san 1956 main india riinsurance corporeshan li

 The life insurance business was also nationalized in 1956 and the Life Insurance Corporation of India was established to conduct business and the business of 245 indigenous foreign insurers was acquired and handed over to the Life Insurance Corporation
 san 1971 main bharat ke saadhaaran beemaa vyavsaay kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya
 The 107 companies that undertook marine, fire and miscellaneous insurance were acquired and handed over to the General Insurance Corporation of India and its four subsidiaries

 The four subsidiaries of the General Insurance Corporation were also separated from March 2003
 ab ye swatantra companiyon ke rup main beemaa vyavsaay kar rahi he
 The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority has authorized the General Insurance Corporation of India as a reinsurer of India
 ab saamaanya beemaa jivan beemaa ke kshetra main kai nijee companiyaan kaary kar rahi he The history of insurance theory is related to the beginning of sea trade
 apane aadi rup main kshatipurti kaa beemaa siddhant sahakaarita ke siddhant par aadhaarit tha jise "jeneral averj" kaha jaataa tha
 It was sometimes necessary at the time of hurricanes or other hazards at sea to lighten the ship by throwing some goods into the sea to protect the ship and other goods
 is prakaar honevaali haani us vyapaar yojana main bhaag lenevaale sabhi hit anupatik rup se vahan kar lete the
 This is the principle of cooperative development as insurance respectively
 samudr beemaa anubandh main keval ek khatre ke viruddh beemaa nahin kiya jaataa varan usamen un sabhi khataron kaa ullekh hota he jo samudrayatra main sambhavya hai
 Keep in mind that the same risks are considered to be suitable for insurance
 aisi yatra main jo haniyaan nishchit hai, jaise pashu aadi kaa biimaar ho janaa athwa fal aadi kaa sad janaa ityadi unka beemaa nahin kiya jaataa
 There is also a condition of sea insurance that the said contract is written ie the insurance certificate is considered to be complete proof of the said insurance contract
 samudr beemaa chunki kshatipurti kaa anubandh he at: beemaa karaanevaale ke vaktavy vastut: satya hone chahie
 Also, even if the insurer has not disclosed the fact that earlier someone had refused to take the said insurance, it still has no effect on the validity of that contract
 anya prakaar ke beemaa sambandhon main pehle kii asweekrutiyaan chhipaana us anubandh ko avaidh qaraar dene ke liye paryaapt he
 Another difference between indemnity insurance and other types of insurance contracts is noticeable
 jivan beemaa main beemaa hit kaa astitv beemaa karaane ke samay hona aavashyak he, bhale hi beemen main varnit ghatana ghatit hone ke samay vah hit rahe yaa na rahe
 For example, if a is insuring a period of fifteen years for the marriage of his daughter, then the existence of the daughter of "A" is necessary at the time of insurance
 us 15 varsh kii avadhi ke purv hi k kii putree kii mrityu bhale hi ho chuki ho, kintu vah dhanrashi k ko praapt ho jaaegi
 But if the daughter of a is not born, then due to non-existence of insurance interest required for the said type of insurance contract, a cannot get the said type of insurance
 iske vipareet kshatipurti ke beemaa anubandh par beemaa hit beemaa karaane ke samay vartmaan ho yaa na ho lekin ukt kshati ghatit hone ke samay dhanrashi chaahanewaale main ukt beemaa hit vyast hona aavashyak he
 For example, a got fire insurance of his house and while the insurance was in operation, he sold the house to B
 bikri hone ke duusare din us makaan main aag lag gai
 In such a situation, the insurance provided by A, although current, cannot claim compensation on the basis of the said insurance contract due to the lack of insurance interest in that house, because the house as well as the house at the time of damage
 Insurance interest has also been expressed in B
 isi siddhant kaa ek nishkarsh yah bhi he ki jo vastu kshatigrast hui he uskaa moolyankan beemaa karaae jane ke samay ke mulya par nahin varan kshati ghatit hone ke samay ke mulya ke aadhaar par hi kiya jaataa he
 The insurance sector has become very widespread in the modern era
 beemaa ke anek prakaar hai parantu mukhya rup se vargeekaran is prakaar he :- In life insurance, the insurer pledges to pay a fixed sum to the insured after a certain period or to the heirs of the insured after a certain period of return
 premium kii raashi nishchit samay tak, nishchit interval se athwa ek mushth bhi jamaa karavaayi ja sakati he
 If the insured dies during the insurance period itself, the insurance premium is not paid upfront and the claim amount is passed on to the heirs, along with financial security, there is also the benefit of saving and appropriation
 agni beemaa main bimakarta bimit ko ek nishchit premium ke badale nishchit samyavadhi main bimit vishaywastu ko agni se hone vaali kshati kii purti karne kaa vachan detaa he, yah saamanytah ek varsh kii avadhi kaa hi karaayaa jaataa he
 In lieu of a fixed return in marine insurance, the insurer undertakes to protect the insured from certain risks and losses from maritime risks
 samudri beemaa jahaaj, jahaaj main laade jane vaale maal, jahaaj ke bhaade va maarg main hone vaali samudron jokhimon jaise jahaaj kaa kisi anya jahaaj yaa chattan se takaraane, samudri tu phan aadi kaa kiya jaataa he
 Social insurance is a system in which many risks such as unemployment, sickness, accident, death, etc
 can be insured with the cooperation of workers, employers and the government so that they can be assured of survival even if these risks arise
 saamaajik biimon main praaia: nimna prakaar ke beemaa sammilit kiye jate he - Apart from marine, fire, there are some other risks that a person tries to insure, and it is also mandatory to get some beams

 The storyboarding process can be very time consuming and complicated
 jis rup main iskaa aajkal vyapak rup main prayog hota he, uskaa vikaas 1930 ke prarambh main walt digni studio main hua
 In his father's biography, The Story of Walt Disney, Disney Disney Miller mentioned that the entire storyboards were first produced in the 1933 Disney short film Three Little Pigs
 jon kenmekar ke anusaar, paper drims: da art and artists of digni storybords main, digni main pehle storyboard kaa vikaas comic kitabon jaise "story scaches" jo 1920 main banaae gaye the or jinka uddeshy anemated cartoon ke chote vishyon jaise plane kreji or steambot vili, bananaa tha, se hua or phir kuch hi varshonchaar anya studio main fail gaya
 According to Christopher Finch in The Art of Walt Disney, Disney credited animator Webb Smith for telling the entire story in a sequence by drawing scenes on different papers and tying them on a bulletin board, and thus the first storyboard He is also credited for making it
 doosraa studio jo "story scaches" se storybords kii taraf badha, vah tha, 1935 ke prarambh main walter lantz productions, harman-ising or leone sclisinger ne bhi 1936 main yahi kiya, jabaki 1937-38 tak sabhi studio storybords kaa upyog kar rahe the

 Storyboarding became popular in the production of live action films in the early 1940s, and then became a fixed medium for previewing films
 pes gailaree ke nireekshak anneti mykalson, ne apane kitaab drawing intu film: diarector'sa drawingus, main 1940 se 1990 ke dashak ko aisa samay mana jab "utpaadan dizin mukhyatah storyboard main se hi banaae jate the
 "storyboards are now an essential part of the construction process
 ek film storyboard nishchit rup se us film kaa ek bade str par comic board hota he athwa film kaa kuch hissaa pehle hi nirmit kar liya jaataa he jisase film ke nirdeshak, chhayakaar or televijan ke vanijyik vigyapanon ke graahak drishyon ko dekh saken or sambhavit samasyaon ke ujagar hone se pehle hi unhen khoj len
 aksar storybords main tir yaa nirdesh shaamil hote hai jisase film kii gatishiltaa kaa pataa chal sake
 Regardless of the fidelity to which a script is written in the making of a movie, a storyboard provides a visual outline of events as they can be viewed through the camera lens
 or interactive media ke maamle main, yah leout or anukram ke rup main hi upyogkarta yaa darshak vishay vastu yaa jaankaree ko dekhtaa he
 In the storyboarding process, most of the film making technical information or interactive media project can be described efficiently by a picture, or by additional words
 kuch live-ection filmon ke nirdeshak, jaise ki joel or ethan koen, praayojakon ke paas jane se pehle storyboard kaa atyadhik prayog karte hai, ve iskaa kaaran yah bataate hai ki isse unhen aavashyak samarthan milane main sahaayta milti he, kyonki ve yatharthatah yah bataa pate hai ki unke paise kaa istemaal kahan kiya jayega
 kai varshon tak adhiktar tippaneekaron dwaara bade vishwaas ke saath yah mana jaataa tha kii alfred hitchkok kii filmon ko baarikiyon sahit storyboard par utraa jaataa tha, haalanki baad main kiye gaye anusandhan se yah pataa chalata he ki yah sab lok prasiddhi ke liye tha
 Other directors take only a few scenes of the film on the storyboard, or at all
 anemeshan nirdeshkon ko aamtaur par storyboard kaa kaaphi prayog karnaa padataa he, kabhi kabhi script likhane ke bajaay sirf storyboard par kaam karnaa padataa he
 a common misconception is that storyboards are not used in theaters
 unka aksar vishesh upkarnon ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he jiskaa upyog nirdeshak or naatakkaar drishy ke leout ko samajhane main karte hai
 The great Russian theater businessman Konstantin Stanislavsky developed the storyboard for the elaborate production plans of his Moscow Art Theater performance
 german nirdeshak or naatakkaar bertolt bract ne apni dant kathaon ko theatre kaa rup dene ke liye kai vistrut storybordon kaa vikaas kiya
 Work related to giving animation and special effects, followed by storyboarding, can also be done on simplified mock-ups called animatics to find out how it will feel and feel in terms of visual dynamics and timing
 In its simplest form, an animative is a series of immovable images that are edited and shown together
 saamanytah, ek praathmik samvaad or / athwa dhwani trek le kar achal drishyon ke saath jod diya jaataa he taaki yah test kiya ja sake ki dhwani or drishy saath saath prabhavi rup se kaary kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 This allows the animator and director to make changes to the screenplay, camera position, shot list and timing issues that may occur in the storyboard
 yadi aavashyak hota he to storyboard or dhwani trek main sanshodhan kar liye jate hai, or storyboard ke achook hone tak ek nayaa anematic banaaya bhi ja saktaa he or nirdeshak ke saath uski samiksha bhi kii ja sakati he
 Editing scenes in the film can be avoided by editing the animatic
 anemeshan aamtaur par ek mahangi prakriya he, atah yadi film bajet main taiyaar kerani ho to yah aavashyak he ki "dilited drishy" kam se kam hon
 Often the animation of the storyboards is done with simple zooms and pans from which the camera comes in motion
 By combining these animations with the available animatics, sound effects and dialogue, a presentation can be created to find out how a film can be shot together
 kuch feechar filmon kii dividi main vishesh ficharon ke tahat nirmaan se sambandhit anemetics die hote hai
 Animatics are also used by advertising agencies to create cheap test ads
 thode pher-badal ke saath "rip-o-matic" maujuuda filmon, televijan kaaryakramon yaa vigyapanon ke drishyon se bhi banaaya jaataa he, jisase prastaavit vigyaapan kii ruparekha ko mahasoos kiya ja sake
rip, kaa is arth main taatpary he ki, kisi moulik kaary ko cheer kar kuch nayaa banaaya jaae
 a photometric is a series of still images that are edited together and shown in a sequence on the screen
 aamtaur par, isamen ek parshv aawaaj, dhvanipath or dhwani prabhaav jod die jate hai taaki ek prastuti de kar yah bataaya ja sake ki ek film kis tarah se filmai ja sakati he
 Photometric has been used by advertisers and advertising agencies to find out the effectiveness of the proposed storyboard before creating a complete television advertisement
 photomatic, ek anematic kii tarah hi anusandhan kaa upkaran he, kyonki yah kuch chuninda darshakon ko hi apana kaam dikhataa he jisase kaam karne vaale logon ko isaki prabhaavashiltaa kaa abhas ho jaae
 Originally, photographs were taken using colored negative films

 Those prints were kept on a platform and their video recording was done with a normal video camera

 Scenes drawn could then be edited

 sanyukt tasviir anemation se se kaaphi jatil drishy, jo ki saamaanya rup se kai test filmon ke bajet se zyada honge, aasaani se banaaye ja sakate hai
 Some authors have also used storyboard-like illustrations to illustrate story books, often featuring characters' positions, backgrounds, and balloons, including instructions for artists, often written in margins and dialogue / captioning
 There used to be a hint

 Storyboards for films are made in several stages
 ve haath ke dwaara banaaye gaye rekhachitron dwaara athwa computer par digitaly bhi banaae jate hai
 If drawing is done by hand, the first step is to create or download a storyboard template
 ye ek rikt comic strip kii tarah dikhte hai, jisamen tippaniyon or dialog ke liye sthaan hota he
 a "thumbnail" sketch is then made
 kuch nirdeshak thambanel sidhe hi aalekh ke haashiye main sketch kar lete hai
 These storyboards received this name because they are primary sketches and no larger than a thumbnail
 kuch gati chitron ke liye, thambanel storybords hi paryaapt hote hai
 However, some filmmakers rely heavily on the storyboarding process
 yadi nirdeshak yaa nirmaataa chaahate hai to, adhik vistrut or vyapak storyboard chitra banaae jate hai
 These pictures are either hand-drawn by professional story board artists or are created using 2D storyboarding programs on a computer
 kuch software aplicoshan vishesh storyboard chhaviyaan bhi dete hai jisase nirdeshak kii kahani ke prati jo manshaa hoti he use vyakt karne ke liye turant shot bananaa sambhav ho paata he
 These boards have more detailed information than thumbnail storyboards and they are able to show the mood of the scene well
 ye phir pariyojna ke chhayakaar ko prastut kiye jate hai jo phir nirdeshak ke vijan ko paane main sahaayak hota he
 Ultimately, if necessary, 3D storyboards are made
 The advantage of 3D storyboards is that they show exactly what the film camera will see, using the lenses used in the camera
 The drawback of 3D is that it takes a lot of time to create scenes
 3 di storybords kaa nirmaan 3 di anemeshan program kii sahaayta se bhi ho saktaa he athwa 3 di kaaryakramon ke bheetar digital kathputliyon kaa prayog kar bhi inhen banaaya ja saktaa he
 Some programs have a collection of low-resolution 3D images that can aid in this process
 kuch 3di aplicoshan chalchitrakaaron ko yah suvidha dete hai ki ve "takneekee" storybordon kaa nirmaan kar saken jo drushtigat rup se sahi shots or frem hote hai
 Although technical storyboards can be helpful, visually correct storyboards can limit a director's creativity
 clasik gati filmon jaise orsan velles kii naagarik ken or 'alfred hitchkok kii north by northwest main, nirdeshkon ne aise storyboard banaae jinhen prarambh main chalchitrakaaron ne fimana asambhav samajha
 aise naveen or naatakeey shots main field or angel kii asambhav gaharaai thi jisamen "camere ke liye koi jagah nahin thi" - kam se kam tab tak nahin thi jab tak nirdeshak ke dwaara kalpit aise shots jinhone nae aayam gadhe ke liye rachanaatmak samaadhaan nahin mil gaye
 It is very important that the director should not be limited to only what the cinematographer considers "possible" or "normal"
 Technical 3D programs can sometimes help cinematographers face the challenges that the director has given them to film complex shots

 Later, many scholars have written the story of Lord Rama according to their wisdom, knowledge and opinion
 is tarah se anekon ramaayanon kii rachanaayen hui hai
 According to Hindu scriptures, Lord Rama was an incarnation of Vishnu
 is avatar kaa uddeshy mrityulok main maanavjaati ko adarsh jivan ke liye maargdarshan dena tha
 Finally, Shriram killed Ravana, the king of the demon race and restored the religion

 In Mithila, Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, also known as Janaki, was also organized as a swayamvar where Rama married Sita by breaking the rainbow according to the Janakprati
 ram or sita ke vivaah ke saath hi saath guru vashishtha ne bharat kaa mandavi se, lakshmana kaa urmila se or shatrughna kaa shrutakirti se karvaa diya
 Shortly after Rama's marriage, King Dasaratha wanted to crown Rama
 is par devtaa logon ko chintaa hui ki ram ko rajya mil jane par ravan kaa vadh asambhav ho jaayegaa
 Distraught, he prayed to Goddess Saraswati for some kind of remedy
 saraswati ne manthra, jo ki kaikeyi kii daasi thi, kii buddhi ko pher diya
 Kaikeyi went to Kop Bhavan with Manthara's advice
 dasharath jab manaane aaye to kaikeyi ne unase vardaan maange ki bharat ko raja banaaya jaye or ram ko chaudaa varshon ke liye vanvaas main bhej diya jaye
 Sita and Lakshman also went to the forest with Rama

 vashishtha ne bharat or shatrughna ko unke nanihaal se bulavaa liya
 On coming back, Bharata did his mother Kaikeyi, for his wretchedness, repented a lot and performed the funeral procession of Dasaratha according to the gurus
 bharat ne ayodhya ke rajya ko asweekaar kar diya or ram ko manaa kar waapas laane ke liye samast snehijanon ke saath chitrakoot chale gayi
 Kaikeyi also felt very sorry for his actions
 sita ke mata-pita sunayana evam janak bhi chitrakoot pahunche
 Bharata and all the other people proposed Ram to go back to Ayodhya to be ruled by Rama, who obeyed his father and obeyed Raghuvansh
 bharat apane snehi janon ke saath ram kii paduka ko saath lekar waapas ayodhya aa gayi
 He enshrined Rama's Paduka on the throne and started living in Nandigram himself
 kuch kaal ke pashchaat ram ne chitrakoot se prayaag kiya tathaa ve atri rishi ke ashram pahunche

 vahaan se phir ram ne aage prasthaan kiya or sharbhang muni se bhent kii
 Sharabhang Muni was residing there only by wishing to see Rama, so having fulfilled his desire for Rama's darshan, burnt his body with yogagni and made Brahmaloka move
 or aage badhane par ram ko sthaan sthaan par haddiyon ke dher dikhaai pade jinke vishay main muniyon ne ram ko bataaya ki rakshason ne anek muniyon ko kha daalaa he or unheen muniyon kii haddiyaan hai
 On this, Rama vowed that he would slay all the demons and make the earth devoid of demons
 ram or aage bade or path main sutikshn, agastya aadi rishiyon se bhent karte huye dandak van main pravesh kiya jahaan par unki mulaakaat jataayu se hui
 Ram made Panchavati his place of residence
 panchvati main ravan kii bahan shurpanakha ne aakar ram se pranay nivedan-kiya
 Rama sent him to Laxman, saying that he is with his wife and his younger brother is alone
 lakshmana ne uske pranay-nivedan ko asweekaar karte huye shatru kii bahan jaan kar uske naak or kaan kaat liye
 Shurpanakha asked for help from khar-khoan and he came to fight with his army
 ladaai main ram ne khar-dooshan or uski sena kaa sanhaar kar daalaa
 Shurpanakha went and complained to her brother Ravana
 ravan ne badla lene ke liye marich ko swarnamrig bana kar bheja jisaki chaal kii maang sita ne ram se kii
 After ordering Laxman to protect Sita, Rama went after him to kill the golden form of Maricha
 marich ke haathon maaraa gaya par marate marate marich ne ram kii aawaaj bana kar ‘ha lakshmana’ kaa krandan kiya jise sun kar sita ne ashankavash hokar lakshmana ko ram ke paas bhej diya
 After Laxman's departure, Sita alone deceived Ravana and took him with him to Lanka
 raste main jataayu ne sita ko bachaane ke liye ravan se yuddh kiya or ravan ne uske pankh katkar use adhamra kar diya
 Not finding Sita, Ram became very sad and started mourning
 raste main jataayu se bhent hone par usne ram ko ravan ke dwaara apni durdasha hone va sita ko har kar dakshin disha kii ore le jane kii baat bataai
 After telling all this, Jatayu gave up his life and Rama proceeded within the dense forest in search of Sita after performing his last rites
 raste main ram ne durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran rakshas bane gandharv kabandh kaa vadh karke uskaa uddhaar kiya or shabari ke ashram ja pahunche jahaan par ki uske dwaara diye gayi jhuthe beron ko uske bhakthi ke vash main hokar khaaya
 Thus Rama proceeded inside the dense forest in search of Sita
 ram rishyamook parvat ke nikat aa gayi
 Sugriv lived with his ministers on that mountain
 sugriv ne, is ashanka main ki kahin baali ne use maarane ke liye un donon veeron ko na bheja ho, hanuman ko ram or lakshmana ke vishay main jaankaree lene ke liye brahman ke rup main bheja
 After knowing that he was not sent by Bali, Hanuman befriended Rama and Sugriva
 sugriv ne ram ko santvana di ki janaki ji mil jaayengin or unhen khojane main vah sahaayta degaa saath hi apane bhai baali ke apane upar kiye gayi atyaachaar ke vishay main bataaya
 Rama fraudulently slaughtered Bali and gave the kingdom of Kishkindha to Sugriva and gave the post of crown prince to Angad's son Angad
 rajya prapti ke baad sugriv vilaas main lipt ho gaya or varsha tathaa sharad ritu vyateet ho gai
 On Rama's displeasure, Sugriva sent the monkeys to search for Sita
 sita kii khoj main gayi vaanron ko ek gupha main ek tapaswini ke darshan huye
 Tapaswini brought the search party to the beach with the power of yoga where she met Sampathi
 sampaati ne vaanron ko bataaya ki ravan ne sita ko lanka ashokavatika main rakhaa he
 Jambavant encouraged Hanuman to cross the sea
 hanuman ne lanka kii ore prasthaan kiya
 Sursa took the test of Hanuman and blessed him by finding him worthy and capable
 maarg main hanuman ne chaaya pakadaney vaali rakshasi kaa vadh kiya or lankini par prahaar karke lanka main pravesh kiya
 He met Vibhishan
 jab hanuman ashokavatika main pahunche to ravan sita ko dhamka rahaa tha
 When Ravana left, Trijata consoled Sita
 ekaant hone par hanuman ne sita se bhent karke unhen ram kii mudrika di
 Hanuman killed Ravana's son Akshay Kumar by destroying the Ashokavatika
 meghnath hanuman ko nagapasha main baandh kar ravan kii sabha main le gaya
 In response to Ravana's question, Hanuman introduced himself as the messenger of Rama
 ravan ne hanuman kii punch main tel main duba hua kapadaa baandh kar aag laga diya is par hanuman ne lanka kaa dahan kar diya
 Hanuman approaches Sita
 sita ne apni chudamani de kar unhen vidaa kiya
 They came back across the sea and met all the apes and all went back to Sugriva
 hanuman ke kaary se ram atyant prasann huye
 Ram reached the beach with the army of apes
 udhar vibhishana ne ravan ko samajhaayaa ki ram se bair na len is par ravan ne vibhishana ko apamaanit kar lanka se nikaal diya
 Vibhishana came under the shelter of Rama and Rama declared him king of Lanka
 ram ne samudr se rasta dene kii vinati kii
 Rama was angry at not accepting the request and fearing his anger, Samudra himself came after pleading for Rama and told him how to build a bridge by Nal and Neel
 jambavant ke aadesh se nal-nil donon bhaaiyon ne vanar sena kii sahaayta se samudr par pul baandh diya
 Sri Rama established Sri Rameshwar and worshiped Lord Shankar and crossed the ocean with the army
 samudr ke paar jaakar ram ne deraa daalaa
 Ravana was deeply disturbed by the news of the bridge being tied and Rama crossing the sea
 mandodari ke ram se bair na lene ke liye samajhane par bhi ravan kaa ahankaar nahin gaya
 Here Rama along with his vanarasena started living on the Subel mountain
 angad ram ke doot ban kar lanka main ravan ke paas gayi or use ram ke sharan main aane kaa sandesh diya kintu ravan ne nahin mana
 The war started when all the peace attempts failed
 lakshmana or meghnad ke madhya ghor yuddh hua
 Lakshman fainted due to the power of Shaktiban
 unke upachaar ke liye hanuman sushen vaidya ko le aaye or sanjivani laane ke liye chale gayi
 On receiving the news from the intelligence, Ravana sent Kalanemi to interrupt Hanuman's work, which Hanuman killed
 aushadhi kii pahchaan na hone ke kaaran hanuman puure parvat ko hi uthaa kar waapas chale
 On the way, in the suspicion of Hanuman being a demon, Bharat fainted by hitting the arrow, but knowing the truth, he sat on his arrow and sent it back to Lanka
 idhar aushadhi aane main vilamb dekh kar ram pralaap karne lage
 Hanuman brought medicine at the right time and Lakshman became healthy with the treatment of Sushen
 ravan ne yuddh ke liye kumbhkarna ko jagaaya
 Kumbhakarna also unsuccessfully prayed to Ravana to go to Rama's shelter
 yuddh main kumbhkarna ne ram ke haathon paramgati praapt kii
 Laxman fought Meghnad and killed him
 ram or ravan ke madhya anekon ghor yuddh huai or ant main ravan ram ke haathon maaraa gaya
 Handing over the kingdom of Lanka to Vibhishan, Rama along with Sita and Lakshman boarded Pushpakviman and left for Ayodhya
 uttarkand ram katha kaa upsanhaar he
 Ram returned to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and the entire Vanarasena
 ram kaa bhavy swaagat hua, bharat ke saath sarvajanon main anand vyaapt ho gaya
 Rama was crowned with praise of the Vedas and Shiva
 abhyaagton kii vidaai di gai
 Rama preached to the praja and praja expressed gratitude
 chaaron bhaaiyon ke do do putr huye
 Ramrajya became a role model
 uparokt baton ke saath hi saath goswami tulsidas ji ne uttarkand main shri ram-vashishtha samvaad, naarad ji kaa ayodhya aakar ramachandra ji kii stuti karnaa, shiv-parvati samvaad, garud moh tathaa garud ji kaa kakbhushundi ji se ramakatha evam ram-mahima sunanaa, kakbhushundi ji ke purvajanm kii katha, gyaan-bhakthi nirupan, jnyanadeepak or bhakthi kii mahaan mahima, garud ke saat prashn or kakbhushundi ji ke uttar aadi vishyon kaa bhi vistrut varnan kiya he
 While Tulsidas ji has abolished Ramcharitmanas by writing the above description, Adikavi Valmiki in his Ramayana narrates the birth of Ravana and Hanuman in Uttarakhand, Sita's exile, Raja Nriga, Raja Nimi, Raja Yayati and the dog's justice in Ramrajya, The birth of Lavkush, the ritual of Ashwamedha Yajna by Rama and the Ramayya composed by Mahakavi Valmiki by his sons Love and Kush in that Yagya
 Singing, Sita's Abyss entry, abandon LAX, is also described 515 518

 All the characters in Ramayana follow their religion
 ramayana ke charitron se sikh lekar manushya apane jivan ko sarthak bana saktaa he
 Inspired by Valmiki Ramayana, Saint Tulsidas composed an epic like Ramcharitmanas which is the Hindi version of Ramayana written in Sanskrit by Valmiki
 ramcharitamanas main hindu aadarshon kaa utkrisht varnan he isiliye ise hindu dharm ke pramukh granth hone kaa shrey mila hua he or prayek hindu parivaar main bhakthibhaav ke saath iskaa pathan pathan kiya jaataa he
 Inspired by the Ramayana itself, Maithilisharan Gupta composed the clauses named Panchavati and Saket
 ramayana main lakshmana kii patni urmila ke ullekhneey tyaag ko shaayad bhulvash andekha kar diya gaya he or is bhul ko saket khandakavy rachakar maithilisharan gupt ji ne sudhara he
 Inspired by the story related to Rama, Shree Bhagwatananda Guru composed the Sanskrit epic Sriraghavendracharitam which is full of wonderful and secret Kathaprasang
 is granth main 20 se adhik prakaar ke ramaayanon kii katha kaa samavesh he

 In rock sciences, vaporization means evaporation from igneous magma and its effect on rock formations
 Pneumatolysis is the alteration of rock or mineral crystallization effected by gaseous emanations from solidifying magma
 The change in rocks due to the combined effect of heat and magma release, which mainly consists of halogen elements, water and compounds of boron, phosphorus, and other alkaline metals, is called volatile metamorphism
 atev vaashpakhanijan shabd mukhyat: ucch taap par vashpiya avasthaa main, uparyukt tatwon se prabhavit kayantaran prakriya kii ore ingit karata he

 The process of metamorphism is said to be due to the action of graphene, superfluous water vapor and fluorine
 grenite main felspar aakraant hokar, abhrak main jo bahudhaa lithium yukt hota he, parivartit ho jate hai
 This results in the formation of a set of muscobite and quartz, called "greysen"
 elbite is prakaar ke vaashpakhanijan se aprabhavit rah kar batch jaataa he, jab ki potash, felspar purnat: nasht ho jate hai
 Topaz is often the main ingredient of Greysen and when its volume exceeds this rock type, the shell is called the "topaz shell"

 Kaolinization is caused by little fluorine and boron with superfluous water vapor

 The story narrated by the twenty-seventh effigy named requestvati is as follows- King Vikramaditya was a marvelous virtuoso
 ve sachche kalakaaron kaa bahut adhik sammaan karte the tathaa spashtvaadita pasand karte the
 Talent was honoured in their court
 chapalusee jaise durgun kii unke yahan koi kadra nahin thi
 Hearing this, one day a young man came to meet them
 darbar main mehfil saji hui thi or sangeet kaa daur chal rahaa tha
 The young man started waiting for the king's permission at the gate
 vah yuvak bahut hi guni tha
 Known many scriptures
 kai rajyon main naukari kar chukaa tha
 Being an outspoken, his refugees were seen to be indignant, so he was fired everywhere
 itani thokare khaane ke baad bhi uski prakruti tathaa vyavhaar main koi parivartan nahin aa sakaa
 He was standing at the door when he heard a voice in his ear and he grumbled - "people sitting in the temple are fools
" sangeet kaa anand uthaa rahe he, magar sangeet kaa jaraa bhi gyaan nahin he
 Sajinda is playing the wrong raga, but no one is denying it
 " uski badbadaahat dwarpal ko spasht sunai padi
 His face became red with anger
 usne usko sambhalkar tippanee karne ko kaha
 When he told the young man that Maharaja Vikramaditya himself was sitting in the Mahafil and that he was a great art connoisseur, the young man scoffed
 usne dwarpal ko kaha ki ve kala premi ho sakate hai, magar kala parkhi nahin, kyonki sajinde kaa doshapurn vaadan unki samaj main nahin aa rahaa he
 That young man also told on which side that conspiracy is sitting
 ab dwarpal se nahin rahaa gaya
 He told the young man that he would get the scepter, if his point was not proved true
 us yuvak ne use sachai kaa pataa lagane ke liye kaha tathaa bade hi aatmavishvaas se kaha ki vah har dand bhugatne ko taiyaar he agar yah baat sach nahin sabit hui
 The gatekeeper went in and this thing reached the king's ears
 vikram ne turant aadesh kiya ki vah yuvak mehfil main pesh kiya jaae
 In front of Vikram too, the young man pointed in one direction and said that there is a player's finger defective
 us ore baithe saare vaadakon kii oongliyon kaa nirikshan kiya jane laga
 In fact, the upper part of a player's thumb was cut and he had put a thin skin on that thumb
 raja us yuvak ke sangeet gyaan ke kaayal ho gaye
 Then he got acquainted with the young man and kept him in his court with due respect
 vah yuvak sachmuch hi bada gyani or kala marmajna tha
 He won the king's heart by showing his ability from time to time
 ek din darbar main ek atyant rupavati narttaki ai
 Her dance was organized and in a few moments the dress was decorated
 vah yuvak bhi darbariyon ke bich baitha hua nrity or sangeet kaa anand uthaane laga
 She was performing a very nuanced dance and Nartki was enthralled by the audience
 tabhi na jane kahan se ek bhanvara aa kar uske vaksh par baith gaya
 The dancer could not stop the dance nor could she remove the bhangra with her own hands, because the breaches would get messed up
 usne badi chaturata se saans andar kii ore khinchi tathaa puure veg se bhanvare par chhod di
 Bhanwra flew out of fear due to breathlessness
 kshan bhar kii is ghatana ko koi bhi na tad sakaa, magar us yuvak kii aankhon ne sab kuch dekh liya
 "wow! Wow!" He got up and put a garland of beads around his neck in that dancer's neck
 saare darbari stabdh rah gaye
 This has become a height of indiscipline
 raja kii upasthiti main darbar main kisi or ke dwaara koi puraskaar diya janaa raja kaa sabase bada apmaan mana jaataa tha
 Vikram also did not like this and asked that young man to give some concrete reason for this audacity
 tab yuvak ne raja ko bhanvare vaali sari ghatana bataa di
 She said that the cleanliness with which the dancer blew the whirlpool was an award-worthy gesture, in harmony with the rhythm, without destroying a bhai bhanima of dance
 use chhodkar kisi or kaa dhyaan gaya hi nahin to puraskaar kaise miltaa
 When Vikram asked Nartki, he supported the young man's words
 vikram kaa krodh gaayab ho gaya or unhone narttaki tathaa us yuvak- donon kii bahut tarif kii
 Now the importance of that young man became more important in his eyes
 jab bhi koi samaadhaan dhoondhna rahata uski baton ko dhyaan se suna jaataa tathaa uske paraamarsh ko gambhirthapurvak liya jaataa
 Once, there was a discussion in the court on intelligence and rituals
 darbariyon kaa kahana tha ki sanskaar buddhi se aate he, par vah yuvak unase sahamat nahin tha
 He used to say that all the sacraments are hereditary
 jab koi mataiky nahin hua to vikram ne ek hal sochaa
 He moved away from the city to build a palace in the forest and appointed dumb and deaf maids in the palace
 ek-ek karke chaar navjaat shishuon ko us mahal main un naukaraaniyon kii dekharekh main chhod diya gaya
 One of them was his son, a General Secretary, a Kotwal and a Brahmin's son
 baarah varsh pashchaat jab ve chaaron darbar main pesh kiye gaye to vikram ne baari-baari se unase poocha- "kushal to he?" chaaron ne alag-alag jawaab die
 The king's son said "all is well", while the son of the general minister described the world as mortal and said, "if the coming has to go, how is the skill?" Kotwal's son said that thieves steal and slander is innocent
 aisi haalat main kushalta kii sochna bemaani he
 Lastly, the Brahmin's son's answer was that as the age decreases day by day, how is the skill
 chaaron ke javaabon ko sunakar us yuvak kii baton kii sachai saamne aa gai
 The king's son was sure to see everything efficient and the minister's son gave a reasoned answer
 isi tarah kotwaal ke putr ne nyaay vyavastha kii charchaa kii, jabaki brahman putr ne darshanik uttar diya
 Everything happened due to our ancestral values

 Emanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 AD, in the city of Königüzburg, under the East Provinces of Germany
 koniguzaberg shahar aaj rus main he or ab iskaa naam kalininograd Kaliningrad he
 His early education was under the supervision of his mother, who was greatly influenced by the religious movement called the "holy Way" of his time
 atev, alpaayu main hi vah dharmanumodith aacharan, saral, suvyavasthit evam adhyavsypurna jivan main ruchi rakhane laga tha
 At the age of 16, after completing his education at the "collegium Pheidrichianum", he entered the University of Königsberg, where for six years he studied physics, mathematics, philosophy and theology
 vishvavidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaant nau varshon ke liye, konigsburg se 60 mile dur, judsken naamak gaanv main chalaa gaya
 There he taught his livelihood in two families and continued his self-study in physics and philosophy
 is bich uske bahut se lekh tathaa laghugranth prakashit hue, jinamein se do–"jivit shaktiyon ke uchit anumaan par vichaar" tathaa "saamaanya prakritik itihaas evam akashasambandhi siddhant" vishesh ullekh hai
 In the first of these publications, he attempted to coordinate the ideas of power of Rene Dacart and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, and in the second the mechanical and objectivist ideas of Newton and Leibnitz, and in the second, the mechanical and purposive ideas of Newton and Leibnitz
 usne "doctor legence" kii oopaadhi ke nimitt aavashyak prabandh bhi 1755 i
 main prastut kar diya tha or konigsburg vishvavidhyalay ne use ukt oopaadhi pradaan kar uski yogyata pramanit kii thi
 But there was no change in his personal problems
 vishvavidhyalay ne uske nau varsh ke parishram se prasann hokar use vishisht vyaakhyaata niyukt kar liya tha, kintu is kaary ke liye use vetan kuch bhi nahin miltaa tha
 Kant, despite odd circumstances, served the university unpaid until 1766 AD
 1758 i
 main usne tark or darshan ke mukhya adhyaaapak pad ke liye prarthana kii thi, kintu vah asafal rahaa
 In 1766 AD, he was appointed Assistant Library Manager along with teaching and now he got ten pounds annual salary
 chaar varshon tak kaant ne is rup main bhi kaary kiya, kintu usne adhyayan chintan or lekhan kaary jari rakhaa
 After being appointed "private Dozant", by 1770 AD, five of his epics were published - uparyukt granthon ke sheershakon se pataa chalata he ki 1755 or 1770 i
 ke bich kaa samay kaant ke vichaaron ke nirmaan kaa tha
 His thinking appears to have developed in a systematic way with the Latin installation paper published in 1770 AD - "the Shapes and Principles of World's Understanding and Wisdom"
 isi varsh, vah konigsburg vishvavidhyalay main tark or darshan ke usee adhyaaapak pad par niyukt hua, jiske liai use 12 varsh purv niraash hona padaa tha
 He had already become worry-free as he was getting 60 pounds annual salary
 un dinon itnaa vetan sammanit adhyapakon ko hi diya jaataa tha
