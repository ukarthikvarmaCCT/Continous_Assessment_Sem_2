 samyavaadee chintanadhara kii manyata he ki adhiktar vichaar, visheshkar samaaj ke sanghathan se sambandhit vichaar, varg vichaar hote hai
 They are actually the views of the class that dominated society at that time
 in vichaaron ko vah varg baaki samaaj par thope rakhata he kyonki yah varg prachaar ke saare sadhano kaa swami hota he
 Ideological conflict in a society with opposing classes is analogous to a conflict of class interests, because ideology can also be a true or false reflection of reality and can also be scientific or unscientific
 pratikriyaavaadi virgon ke hit juthi vichaardhaara ko poshit karte hai
 The interests of the progressive, revolutionary classes are instrumental in building a scientific consensus
 samyavaadee manyatanusaar vichaardhaara kaa vikaas antatogatva arthvyavastha se nirdhaarit hota he, parantu saath hi usamen kuch saapeksh swatantraaa bhi hoti he
 Its manifestation is particularly in the impossibility of directly explaining economic content of ideology, as well as some inequality of economic and ideological development
 in sabake alaava vichaardhaara kii saapeksh swatantraaa kii adhiktar abhivyakti vichaardhaaratmak vikaas ke aantarik niyamon kii sankriya main or saath hi un vichaardhaaratmak kshetron main hoti he, jo aarthik aadhaar se bahut dur sthit hote hai
 The reason for the relative independence of ideology is that ideological development is under the influence of various non-economic factors
 ye kaarak hai : vichaardhaara ke vikaas main aantarik anukramik sambandh, vichaardhaara vishesh ke nirupakon kii nijee bhoomika tathaa vichaardhaara ke vibhinn roopon kaa parsparik prabhaav, aadi
 In the sixth and seventh decade of the twentieth century, mismatches of a scientific view of reality and ideology of reality became widely prevalent among bourgeois philosophers
 burjua vichaardhaara ko atmik pratyay kii bhanti maanate hai jo keval samooh yaa dal vishesh ke hiton ko vyakt karti he
 That is why they are willing to make differences between science and ideology, to keep them in competition
 burjua darshan or vigyaan kaa tathakthith "nirvichaardharakaran" karne kaa praytn karte hai
 In the eighth decade, bourgeois ideologues began to talk of "rethinking" in the realization of their cause, presenting their new ideology against communism

 bahadur shah zafer bharat main mogul samrajya ke aakhri shahenshaah the or urdu ke maane hue shaayar the
 He led the Indian soldiers in the first Indian freedom struggle of 1857
 yuddh main haar ke baad angrejon ne unhen burma bhej diya jahaan unki mrityu hui
 Zafar was born on October 24, 1775
 unke pita akbar shah dwitiya or maa lalbai thim
 After the death of his father, Zafar was made Mughal emperor on 18 September 1837
 yah digar baat thi ki us samay tak dilli kii sultanate behad kamjor ho gai thi or mughal badshaah nammaatr kaa samraat rah gaya tha
 Zafar had to pay a heavy price for playing an important role in India's first freedom struggle
 unke putron or prapautron ko british adhikariyon ne saream goliyon se bhun daalaa
 Moreover, he was taken captive to Rangoon, where he died as a prisoner on November 7, 1862
 unhen rangoon main shwadagon pagoda ke najadik dafnaaya gaya
 His burial site is now known as Bahadur Shah Zafar Dargah
 aaj bhi koi deshpremi vyakti jab tatkaaleen burma kii yatra karata he to vah jafar kii majaar par jaakar unhen shradhanjali dena nahin bhuulataa
 How much respect people had for him can be gauged from the fact that in many places in India, roads have been named after him, while in Lahore city of Pakistan, a road was named after him
 is
 bangladesh ke old dhaka shahar sthit victoria park kaa naam badalakar bahadur shah jafar park kar diya gaya he
 In 1857, when the spark of India's independence erupted, all the rebel soldiers and kings and emperors considered him Emperor of India and led them to brick by brick of the British
 angrejon ke khilaaf bhartiya sainikon kii baghawat ko dekh bahadur shah jafar kaa bhi gussa foot padaa or unhone angrejon ko hindustan se khadedane kaa aahvaan kar daalaa
 Indians defeated the British hard in Delhi and other parts of the country
 shuruaati parinaam hindustani yoddhaon ke paksh main rahe, lekin baad main angrejon ke chal-kapat ke chalate pratham swadhinata sangram kaa rukh badal gaya or angrej baghawat ko dabaane main kaamyaab ho gaye
 Bahadur Shah Zafar took refuge in Humayun's tomb, but Major Hadas captured him along with his son Mirza Mughal and Khizar Sultan and grandson Abu Bakr
 angrejon ne julm kii sabhi hadein paar kar deen
 When Bahadur Shah Zafar was hungry, the British served him in front of the plate and brought his sons heads
 unhone angrejon ko jawaab diya ki hindustan ke bete desh ke liye sir qurbaan kar apane baap ke paas isi andaaj main aayaa karte hai
 The British sent the last Mughal emperor out of the country to Rangoon to eliminate the rebellion for independence
 bahadur shah jafar sirf ek deshbhakt mughal badshaah hi nahin balki urdu ke mashhoor kavi bhi the
 He wrote a number of famous Urdu poems, many of which were lost or destroyed during the upheaval that broke out against the British
 unke dwaara urdu main likhi gai panktiyaan bhi kaaphi mashhoor hai- xxrep 4 , Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
,,, His Urdu poems continued to flourish in Rangoon outside the country
 vahaan unhen har vakt hindustan kii phikr rahi
 His last wish was that he take the last breath of his life in India and be buried there, but that could not happen
 lagata nahin he ji meraa ujde dayaar main,kis kii bani he alam-e-napaayadaar main
 Bulbul was written from Bagban and not Sayyid, destined to be imprisoned in fasal-e-bahar

 The day was over in the evening, the legs of the spreaders would sleep in kunj-e-mazar
 kitna he badanaseeb 'zafer' dafn ke liye,do gaz zamin bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 There are very few rulers like Bahadur Shah Zafar who love their country like Mehbooba and succumb to pardes with the promise of not getting a place in ku-i-yaar
 yahi buniyadi farq tha moolbhoot hindustani vichaardhaara ke saath jo apane desh ko apni maan maanate he
 When King Zafar breathed his last while imprisoned in Rangoon, this lion of his own famous ghazal must have been on his lips- "how much is bad luck for Zafar Dawn, two yards of land was not even found in ku-i-yaar 
 " Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor to play an important role in India's first freedom struggle, is also noted as a great poet of Urdu
 unki shaayari bhavuk kavi kii bajaay deshbhakti ke josh se bhari rahati thi or yahi kaaran tha ki unhone angrej shaskaon ko takhte-landan tak hindustan kii shamsheer chalane kii chetavanee di thi
 According to public opinion, when the emperor Zafar was arrested after the first freedom struggle, an English military officer who knew Urdu said this lion while sarcastically saying - "dum dum nahi, now Khair mango ki a jafar is now sheath Is Shamsheer of India 

 !! " On this, Zafar gave a befitting reply and said - "there will be boo in Hindi when the talk of Iman, the planks will go till London
 bharat main mughalkaal ke antim badshaah kahe jane vaale jafar ko pratham swatantraaa sangram ke dauraan dilli kaa badshaah banaaya gaya tha
 One of the few orders he gave as soon as he became emperor was to ban cow slaughter
 is aadesh se pataa chalata he ki ve hindu-muslim ekta ke kitne bade pakshdhar the
 According to Dr
 Shailnath Chaturvedi, former Professor of History at Gorakhpur University, during the time of 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was such a great personality, who was respected not only as a king but also as a secular person
 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again
 deshprem ke saath-saath jafar ke vyaktitv kaa ek anya pahalu shaayari thi
 Not only did he encourage large Urdu poets like Ghalib, Daag, Momin and Jauk, but he himself was a good poet
 saahitiyik samikshakon ke anusaar jafar ke samay main jahaan mughalakalin satta charmara rahi thi vahiin urdu sahitya khaskar urdu shaayari apni bulandiyon par thi
 After Zafar's death, his poetry was compiled under the name "kulliyat e Zafar"

 Around 150 CE, Claudius Ptolemy mentions five stars appearing in nebulae in issue VII-VIII of his book Almagest
 unhone saptarshi taramandal main ek badalon se yukt yaa dhundhale kshetra kaa bhi ullekh kiya tha, jo kisi bhi taare ke saath nahin judaa tha
 Unlike the galaxies, the first real nebula was mentioned by the Persian astronomer Abd al-rahman al-sufi in his "situated Star Book"
 unhone andromeeda gallexi ke sthaan par "ek chota badal" dekha tha
 He characterized the Omricran Velorum constellation Punj as a "nebulous star" or obscure star and other obscure objects in Bruchi's cluster

 In 1715, Edmund Halley published a list of six nebulae
 Throughout the century, the number continued to increase, with the compilation of a list of 20 released in 1746 by Jean Philippe de Chasaux
 Nicolas Louis de Lacale listed 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope in 1751â€“53
 Most of which were previously unknown

 In early 1864, William Huggins investigated the spectra or range of about 70 nebulae
 They found that about a third of them had a wide range of gas inclusions
 baaki main ek satat vistrut shrenee dikhaai di or inhen sitaron kaa ek samooh mana gaya
 In 1912, a third category was added when Vesto Slifer demonstrated that the nebulae around the Meropee star resembled the Pleiades open starfish
 is prakaar niharika taron ke prativimvit prakaash dwaara chamakta he
 Slifer and Edwin Hubble continued to collect a wide range of these from several diffused nebulae and discovered that 29 of these showed emission spectra and 33 had continuous spectra of starlight
 1922 main habal ne ghoshnaa kii ki lagbhag sabhi niharikaayen sitaron se judy hai or unki roshni taron ke prakaash se aati he
 They also discovered that nebulae in the emission spectrum are almost always warmer than B1 or more, whereas nebulae with continuous spectra appear with relatively cold stars
 habal or henry noris rasel donon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki garm taron ke aasapaas kii niharikaayen kisi na kisi prakaar se parivartit ho rahi hai
 Many nebulae are formed due to the mutual gravity of the gas in the interstellar medium

 Dark or dark nebulae are the same as diffuse nebulae, but they cannot be seen by the light emitted or reflected by them
 Instead, they are seen as dark clouds in front of distant stars or emission nebulae
 haalanki ye niharikaayen prakaash tarangon par alag-alag dikhaai detii hai, par ve sabhi infrared yaa avarakt taragon par utsarjan ke ujjwal strot hai
 This emission mainly comes from the dust inside the nebulae

 It is definitely said that everyone is united for the benefit of the country but it does not seem possible
 ye vichaarneey hai : baat kashmir kii he to donon hi taraf ke kashmir ke log chaahe ve musalmaan ho yaa gaiyr-muslim, jahaalat or dukhabhari jindagi ji rahe hai
 If you are having fun then separatists, terrorists and their masters

 The situation in Indian Kashmir is many times better than Pakistani Kashmir
 paak adhikrut kashmir se kai muslim pariwaron ne aakar bharat main sharan le rakhi he
 Pakistan has ruined Kashmir on both sides
 bhutan ke 10wein hisse jitne kshetrafal vaale â€˜land locd aaazaad deshâ€™ se na bharat kaa bhala hoga, na kashmiri musalamaanon kaa
 Pakistan and China will surely do well and ultimately it will be that some part of it will be eaten by Pakistan and some will be swallowed by China
 china ne to kuch bhaag nigal hi liya he
 The fundamentalist Kashmiris do not understand this and they do not even want to understand
 ye itihaas he : 1947 ko vibhajit bharat aaazaad hua
 At that time, the work of merging Indian princely states was going on, while the tribes were being united in Pakistan
 idhar junagarh, kashmir, hyderabad or travnakor kii riyaasaten vilay main der laga rahi thim to kuch swatantra rajya chaahati thim
 This led to instability in these states
 junagarh or hyderabad kii samasya se kahin adhik jatil kashmir kaa vilay karne kii samasya thi
 Muslims were the majority in Kashmir but the number of Pandits was also not small
 kashmir kii seemaa pakistan se lagane ke kaaran samasya jatil thi atah jinna ne kashmir par kabja karne kii ek yojana par turant kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Although India and Pakistan had been divided in which the territories had also been settled, Jinnah took advantage of the situation and sent the Pakistani army to Kashmir on 22 October 1947 under the guise of tribal robbers
 vartmaan ke paak adhikrut kashmir main khun kii nadiyaan baha di gayi
 King Harisingh, the ruler of Kashmir, fearing this bloody game, returned to Jammu
 vahaan unhone bharat se sainik sahaayta kii maang kii, lekin sahaayta pahunchane main bahut der ho chuki thi
 Nehru had friendship with Jinnah
 ve yah nahin soch sakate the ki jinna aisa kuch kar baithenge
 But Jinnah did it like this
 bharat vibhaajan ke samay tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru kii dhulmul niti or adoordarshita ke kaaran kashmir kaa maamla ansulajhaa rah gaya
 If the whole of Kashmir was in Pakistan or the whole of Kashmir was in India, the circumstances would have been different
 lekin aisa ho nahin saktaa tha, kyonki kashmir par raja harisingh kaa raaj tha or unhone bahut der ke baad nirnay liya ki kashmir kaa bharat main vilay kiya jaae
 Due to this late decision, Pakistan captured almost half of Kashmir by sending tribesmen to Gilgit and Baltistan
 bhartiya sena pakistani sena ke chakke chhudaate hue, unke dwaara kabja kiye gaye kashmiri kshetra ko punah praapt karte hue teji se aage bad rahi thi ki bich main hi 31 disambar 1947 ko nehruji ne yuano se apil kii ki vah pakistan ke uttar-pashchimi luteron ko bharat par akraman karne se roke
 As a result, a cease-fire was declared between India and Pakistan on 1 January 1949
 isse pehle 1948 main pakistan ne kabailiyon ke vesh main apni sena ko bhartiya kashmir main ghusaakar samoochee ghati kabjane kaa prayaas kiya, jo asafal rahaa
 Nehruji's move to UNO led to a ceasefire and the Indian Army was tied up, which could never succeed in getting the Indian Army the remaining territory occupied by Pakistan
 aaj kashmir main aadhe kshetra main niyantran rekha he to kuch kshetra main antarrashtriya seemaa
 There is constant firing and infiltration from the international border
 iske baad pakistan ne apane sainya bal se 1965 main kashmir par kabja karne kaa prayaas kiya jiske chalate use munh kii khaani padi
 Pakistan lost in this war
 haar se tilamilaae pakistan ne bharat ke prati puure desh main nafrat failaane kaa kaary kiya or pakistan kii samoochee raajnneeti hi kashmir par aadhaarit ho gai yani ki satta chahie to kashmir ko kabjane kii baat karo
 As a result, in 1971, he again attempted to annex Kashmir
 tab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne iskaa datakar muqabla kiya or antat: pakistan kii sena ke 1 lakh sainikon ne bharat kii sena ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kar diya or â€˜bangladeshâ€™ naamak ek swatantra desh kaa janm hua
 Indira Gandhi made a big mistake here
 yadi ve chaahatin to yahaan kashmir kii samasya hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye sulajh jaati, lekin ve julfikar ali bhutto ke bahekaave main aa gayi or 1 lakh sainikon ko chhod diya gaya
 After this war, Pakistan understood that it would be difficult to defeat India in a face-to-face battle to capture Kashmir

 When an experienced and thoughtless leader Rajiv Gandhi took over the reins of the country in place of a powerful leader, his critics started saying that he has no plan and no policy
 1984 ke dangon ke dauraan unhone jo kaha, use kai logon ne khaarij kar diya
 He shifted his attention completely from Kashmir to Punjab and Sri Lanka
 indira gandhi ke baad bharat kii raah badal gai
 Due to this new game of terrorism in Punjab, Pakistan's eyes once again turned towards Muslim-majority Indian Kashmir
 usne paak adhikrut kashmir main logon ko aatank ke liye taiyaar karnaa shuru kiya
 The Afghanistan experience was beginning to work here
 tatkaaleen raashtrapati general jiya-ul-haq ne 1988 main bharat ke viruddh â€˜oparation topaakâ€™ naam se â€˜war vid lo intencityâ€™ kii yojana banaai
 Under this plan, the people of Indian Kashmir had to sow the seeds of separatism and hatred towards India and then put weapons in their hands
 kai baar munh kii khaane ke baad pakistan ne apane se zyada shaktishaalee shatru ke viruddh 90 ke dashak main ek nae tarah ke yuddh ke bare main sochna shuru kiya or antat: usne use â€˜war of lo intencityâ€™ kaa naam diya
 Actually, it is a developed form of guerrilla warfare

 Due to this wavering attitude of Indian politicians, 'operation Topak' in Kashmir continued without any problem and Indian politicians continued to enjoy power by becoming ostrich
 kashmir or purvottar ko chhodkar bhartiya rajaneta sab jagah dhyaan dete rahe
 'operation Topak' reached the first to second and second to third stages
 ab unka iraadaa sirf kashmir ko hi ashaant rakhana nahin rahaa, ve jammu or ladakh main bhi sakriy hone lage
 The Pakistani army and ISI organized riots in Kashmir and after that there was a series of terrorism
 pehle charan main masjidon kii taadaad badhanaa, duusare main kashmir se gairmuslimon or shiyaon ko bhagaanaa or tisare charan main baghawat ke liye janata ko taiyaar karnaa

 More than 7 lakh Kashmiri Pandits were displaced due to terrorism in Kashmir and they moved to other parts of the country including Jammu
 is dauraan hajaaron kashmiri panditon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Although there are still about 3 thousand Kashmiri Pandits living in the Kashmir Valley, but now they are able to get out of the house very rarely

 == reference == yah 10dec me banaya jata he |ek chikitsakeey tapamapi]] a thermometer or thermometer is a device used to measure heat or 'heat stress'
 'tapamiti' bhautikee kii us shakha kaa naam he, jisamen tapamaapan kii vidhiyon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Thermometers can be built based on many principles
 dravon kaa aaytan taap grahan kar bad jaataa he tathaa aaytan main hone vaali yah vruddhi tapakram ke samaanupati hota he
 Ordinary thermometers work on this principle
 tapamaapan kii ikai nirdhaarit karne ke liye kisi padaarth ko kramash: do nishchit tapiya samyavasthaon main rakhaa jaataa he
 These are called fixed points
 in avasthaaon main padaarth ke kisi vishesh gun ke pariman nikaal lete hai or unke antar ko ek nishchit sankhya main baraabar baraabar baant dete hai
 Each of these degrees is considered a unit of temperature, which is called a degree or degree
 bahut samay se tapamapiyon main himbindu or bhapavindu kaa niyat binduon ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The temperature at which pure ice and pure air-saturated water coexist at the pressure of one atmosphere is called a snow point
 isi prakaar nishchit daab par shuddh pani or shuddh bhaap kaa samya bhapabindu batalaata he
 In normal thermometers, there is a small hollow hole in the glass, filled with mercury or liquid
 tapiya prasaran ke kaaran drav nalee main chadh jaataa he
 Marks are placed in front of the bottom of the fluid at both fixed points
 centegrade paimaane main, jisko ab selsius paimaana kehete hai, himbindu ko shunya or bhapabindu ko 100 degree maanate hai
 The distance between these two signs is divided into 100 even parts
 fahrenheit maapehit mapkram main ye donon bindu kramash: 32 or 212 degree maane jate hai or inkaa antar 180 bhaagon main vibhakt hota he
 In the above thermometers, the temperature is based on thermal transmission, but not necessarily so
 koi bhi gun, jo tapavriddhi ke anusaar ekadishtataa se badhata he, is kaary ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 In fact, many sensitized thermometers in the laboratory are based on electronegative changes or thermodynamics
 gunon kii tarah drav padaartho par bhi koi pratibandh nahin hota
 Any substance can be used in a thermometer, but the main problem is that different thermometers can be created by the difference of substances and properties, except for the two fixed points, there will be differences in readings at all other temperatures
 isse siddh he ki yah sab mulat: pramanik nahin maane ja sakate
 In principle, thermodynamics based on thermodynamics are considered automatic proofs and other scales are purified accordingly
 is vigyaan main aise ingine kii kalpana kii gai he jo ek bhatthi se ooshmaa lekar uskaa kuch ansh mahattam dakshata ke saath kaary main parivartit kar detaa he or shesh bhaag ek nimnatapiya sanghnitr ko de detaa he
 This is called the Carno engine, or reversible engine
 siddhant ke anusaar agar bhatthi or sanghnitr ke bahut se bhinn tapiya jode ekatrit hon or ek carno ingine prayek ke bich kramash: lagaaya jaae, to uske dwaara kiya gaya kaary in jodo ke tapatar bhed ke samaanupati hota he
 Thus the temperature can be determined by measuring the work
 is ingine kii dakshata uske silinder main bhare hue dravya or uski avasthaa par nirbhar nahin karti, isliye isko taapmaana kaa aadhaar mana gaya he or iske dwaara nirdhaarit taap ko paramtaap kehete hai
 Like the centigrade and Fahrenheit scales, the permittivity scale is not arbitrarily zero
 carno ingine dwaara kiya gaya kaary bhatthi or sanghnitr donon ke taap par nirbhar karata he
 The thermal state of the condenser can also be such that it converts all the heat from the engine furnace to work and the condenser does not get any part of it
 aisi sthiti main sanghnitr kaa taap paramashunya mana jaataa he
 To determine the degree of degree, two fixed points are required as before
 1954 i0 se purv paramtaap paimaane main bhi him or bhaap binduon kaa prayog hota tha
 The temperature difference of these two was considered to be 100 Â° ultimate
 iskaa yah arth he ki kaarne ingine kii bhatthi ko bhapabindu par or sanghnitr ko himbindu par rakhane se jo kaary miltaa he uskaa shatansh kaary ek degree pradarshit karti he
 The major difficulty in this arrangement is that the accuracy of the icepoint is limited and there is a difference of up to Â± 01 Â° Pa in the zodiacs obtained by different scientists
 isse bachane ke liye san 1954 se antarrashtriya nishchay ke anusaar keval ek hi niyat bindu kaa upyog hone laga he
 Trikindu is the temperature at which water, ice and water vapor are possible
 iskaa maan swechha se 273
16Â° paa maan liya gaya he
 It can be said that before 1954, the paramount scale was determined by three points, but now only two points are used
 duusaren shabdon main is lekh ke prarambh main varnit do niyat binduon main se ek paramashunya or doosraa trikbindu hota he
 The 1 / 273
16 fraction of the work done by the Carno engine working between Trikbindu and Paramanyu shows an absolute degree of work
 carno kaa ingine adarsh maatr he or vyavhaar main iskaa nirmaan sambhav nahin, parantu yah siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki adarsh gas ke tapiya prasaran dwaara nirmit tapamapi ke paathyank paramtaap ke baraabar hote hai
 Therefore, the ideal gas scale is considered to be an automatic proof, or primary standard
 adarsh gas us gas ko kehete hai jo nimnlikhit niyam kaa paalan karti he: In which there is pressure, volume and temperature
 niyatank he jiskaa maan prayek adarsh gas kii ek gram-anu maatra ke liye ek samaan hota he
 Gas thermometers are of two types, one with constant volume and the other with constant pressure
 pehle kii kriya saral he or uski trutiyon kaa sanshodhan vishwasaneey rup se kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence only static volume thermometers are used
 jaisaa naam ke prakat he, inase gas kaa aaytan sthir rakhkar daab kaa maapan kiya jaataa he
 It takes a lot of hard work and time to extract heat from an ideal gas thermometer
 anek kaarnon se paath main trutiyaan hona sambhav he or inke liye praapt falon main sanshodhan karnaa hota he
 Some errors are corrected by making appropriate changes in the temperature of the thermometer and long calculations have to be done for some
 isse yah siddh he ki gas tapamapi prayogshaala main dainik kaary ke liye upyukt nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, according to international determination, the melting and boiling points of some substances are used as the primary standard
 ye ank adarsh gas-paimaane se bahut parishram ke pashchaat thik rup se maap liye gaye hai or unke maan antarrashtriya sweekruti paa chuke hai

 Like thermal propagation, this increase can also be used in temperature
 is kaary ke liye anek dhaatuon ke taron kaa upyog hota he
 Nevertheless, a thermometer made of platinum wire is more important because it is used for interpolation of international scale
 taar shuddh ghaatu kaa or vikrutimukt hona aavashyak he
 Wrap the wire in a thin mica, or crystal frame, in the bulb and measure its resistance by calculating the heat by the appropriate equation as needed
 pratiroshmapan ke liye kai prakaar ke vidyutsetuon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Among them, the calendar-griffith's bridge is old and well known
 yah wheatstone sethu ke siddhanthapar aadhaarit he
 The carrier wires that are connected to the platinum wire of resistance are also heated by heat, which also changes their resistance
 yah parivartan bhi sethu dvaaramaapit hokar taap kii gananaa main ashuddhi kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 To remove this error from the calendar Griffith bridge, exactly the same type of carrier wire is also placed in the conjugate arm of the bridge
 donon jode tapamapi main paas paas rahete hai or inpar ooshmaa kaa ek sa prabhaav padataa he
 For this reason, they have no effect on the balance and measured resistance of the bridge
 is truti ko dur karne kaa anya upaay yah he ki platinum ke taar kaa pratirodh na nikaal kar uske siron ke bich vibhavantar napate hai
 a certain amount of electric current is carried inside the wire
 iske do siron ko ek vibhavamaapi se jodakar vibhavatanr maap lete hai
 Since the resistance is proportional to the resistance, the resistance is calculated according to the rules of ohms
 inamen vaahak taron ke pratirodh kaa prabhaav purnataya lupt ho jaataa he
 If the wires of two different metals are combined in a circuit and their confluents are placed at different temperatures, then electric current flows in the circuit
 yah dhara paripath main sugrahi dharamapi dwaara dekhi ja sakati he
 The value of the generating force of the current, that is, the electric force, depends on the temperature of a and b
 at: isko naapakar tapantar gyaat kar sakate hai
 The joints of such wire are called heat pair
 antarashtriya paimaane main prayukt tapantar yugmon kii dhaatuon kaa varnan upar kiya gaya he, kintu prayogshaala main sugrahita or prayog kii aavashyaktaaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar vibhinn dhaatuen kaam main laai jaati hai
 The temperature in the heat pair is dependent on the temperature, so the temperature at the confluence of the lower temperature is kept constant
 k or kha siron ko vibhavamaapi athwa milivoltmapi se sanyukt karke EMF maap liya jaataa he
 It is directly measured in millivoltmeters, but it is not as sensitive as a voltmeter
 jab kisi thos vastu ko garam kiya jaataa he to usase urja kaa vidyucchumbakeey tarangon ke rup main vikiran hota he
 The wavelength of the waves is low when they are low in temperature and they feel heat
 adhik tapavriddhi hone par chote tarangadairdhyavaali tarangon kaa aadhiky ho jaataa he, jinase prakaash kii pratiti hoti he
 The amount of radiated energy and its properties also depend on the state of the hot object
 purnataya kaali vastu main yah gun hota he ki vah apane upar padanevaali samast vikeern urja kaa shoshan kar leti he or swat: adhiktam urja kaa vikiran karti he
 Such an object is also known as Krishna object or Krishnaka
 yadi chaaron ore se band khokhale pind kii deevaaron ko samtap par rakhaa jaae to uske bheetar utpann vikeern urja gun or maatra main purnataya krishnika vikiran ke samaan hoti he
 Therefore, in the laboratory, we use such a hollow pot for a black body
 yah avashya karte hai ki usamen ek chota chhidr bana dete hai, jisase bheetar se urja baahar aa sake or uske gunon kaa adhyayan sambhav ho
 For the highest temperature use a black body
 isapar aadhaarit tapamapi do prakaar ke hote hai
 The amount of complete radiation is measured in one
 isko purna vikiran uttapamapi kehete hai
 The second type studies the properties of radiation
 inako prakaashiya uttapamapi kehete hai
 These thermometers have the property that they do not require the thermometer to be attached to a hot material and can measure high temperature
 par inamen dosha yah he ki siddhantat: inase keval krishnika kaa tapamaapan sambhav he
 The temperature of other items will be less than the actual temperature, which requires modification
 yah stephen ke niyam par aadhaarit he
 According to this law, the energy radiated by a black body is proportional to the fourth degree of absolute heat, that is, ek sthiraank he
 For temperature measurement, the radiation of a thermodynamic object focuses on one end of a heating pair from a lens or mirror, causing energy to be extinguished
 agar sthiraank maaloom ho to uparokt sameekaran dwaara taap kii gananaa ho sakati he
 In fact, the power of heat is slightly different from 4 due to many errors
 isliye vyavhaar main neeche die gaye sameekaran kaa prayog karte hai: It has more constants
 b stephen ke niyamanusaar 4 hona chahie, kintu yahan isko agyaat maan lete hai
 The heat and temperature of a thermodynamic black body is the temperature of the pair
 uttapamapak ko nishchit tapon kii krishnikaon ke samaksh rakhkar a or b kaa maan nikaal liya jaataa he
 There is such a arrangement of radiation focalization in the device that the heat measured from it does not depend on the distance of the heat object
 yadi vastu purnataya krishna na ho to is ashuddhi ke liye sanshodhan kar liya jaataa he
 In these, the microscopic fraction of the spectrum of radiation received from the black body, which has a wavelength of about one, is sorted and its intensity is compared to the radiation intensity of a standard lamp
 yadi tarangadairghy ke liye paramtaap par krishnika kii vikiran tivrata par uski tivrata ho, to plank ke niyamanusaar Is a constant whose value is determined by Planck's theory
 yadi E1, E2 or T1 gyaat hon, to T2 gyaat ho jaataa he
 The invisible fibers change the radiation intensity of the standard light in the atomometer in such a way that its intensity becomes equal to the intensity of the radiated energy measured
 us samay batti kaa tantu adrishy ho jaataa he
 In another type of optical thermometer, the intensity of standard radiation is kept constant and enters the thermometer, including radiation of objects of unknown heat
 daanon ko lambavat talon main rekhadhruvit kar diya jaataa he
 It is arranged that the image of each radiation should be semi-spherical and adjacent to each other
 inako ek nikal prijgs dwaara dekha jaataa he, jisko itnaa ghumaate he ki donon pratibimbon kii prakashtivrata ek si pade
 Find the temperature from the above formula by finding E1 / E2 from the rotating angle of nickel
 antarrashtriya paimaane ke sambandh main 'nimna taap' kaa 1900 sein0 tak maapan varnit he
 This leads to the use of volatile thermometers for lower temperatures
 drav kii vashpadaab uske taap par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, the gases transform into liquid form and fill them in steam volatiles
 daab kii maatra se turant taap gyaat ho jaataa he
 For this, oxygen, nitrogen and helium are used in liquid form
 helium vashpadabeey tapamapiyon se lagbhag 10 tak taap maapit ho saktaa he
 This causes magnetic thermometers to be used for low temperatures
 isamen ek samchumbakeey lavan naapi jaati he or curi ke niyam ke anusaar gananaa karke taap nikaal lete hai
 Normally this temperature has errors, which are amended to remove the temperature
 paare kaa tapamapi sarvavidit he
 Due to its many properties, it is commonly used, but its accuracy is limited
 jahaan vishesh yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he vahaan iske vaachan main anek trutiyon ke liye sanshodhan karnaa padataa he
 The most prominent error in these is that the zero symbol varies
 yah do karno se hota he
 When a thermometer is made, its glass keeps shrinking for a long time after that, due to which the zero sign keeps changing
 duusare, jab bhi kisi garam vastu kaa taap napate he, tab shishe ko apni saamaanya avasthaa main aane main bahut samay lagata hai
 The thermometer or thermometer can be classified into two distinct groups according to the level of information on the underlying thermodynamic rules and the physical basis of the quantities
 praathmik tapamapi ke liye, padaarth kii maapit visheshta itani bhalee prakaar gyaat hoti he ki taapmaana ko bina kisi agyaat pariman ke pariklit kiya ja saktaa he
 Examples of this are thermometers that are angular asymmetrical on the equation of a gas state, the velocity of sound in a gas, the thermal noise voltage or the flow of an electric resistor, and the gamma ray emission of some radioactive nuclei in a magnetic field
 Are based on
 praathmik tapamapi apekshaakrit jatil hote hai
 == Usage == a temperature of 96 Â° Â© to 110 Â° Â© is measured with a medical thermometer
 2- paare kaa himank -39Â°Â©hota he
 And to measure the temperature below that, use a thermometer with alcohol
 alcohol kaa himank -115Â°Â©hota he
 The temperature of the sun is measured by a 3-pyrometer

 During the 18th SAARC Summit held in Nepal in 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had proposed a satellite serving the needs of SAARC member countries
 jo unki 'pehle pados' niti kaa hissaa tha
 Although the satellite is intended to serve in the SAARC region, Pakistan opted out of the program, while Afghanistan and Bangladesh did not pledge their commitments
 2014 main bhartiya aam chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan narendra modi ne sanket diya tha ki vah apni videsh niti ko sakriy rup se bharat ke padosi deshon ke saath sambandhon main sudhaar laane par dhyaan denge

 In other words, the study of the process of converting 'word' to 'term' is called morphology
 rupavigyaan, bhashavigyaan kaa ek pramukh ang he
 Under this, various parts of the term - basic nature and prefix, suffix, inflection - are analyzed properly, so some Indian philologists have given the term "nature-suffix-idea"

 Walking through the steps, we reach to the sentence and syntax
 "kisi bhashaa ke padvibhag ko thik-thik hridyangam karne kaa arth he us bhashaa ke vyakaran kaa puraa gyaan"
 Different types of morphology have been enumerated based on the point of view of the study of form
 bhartiya aacharyon ne shabdon kii do sthitiyaan - siddh evam asiddh di hai
 In these, the word "imperfect" is simply translated as "word" and the word "siddha" as "verse"
 "siddhi" ke sumbat evam tisaint tathaa "asiddh" ke kai bhed prabhed kiye gaye hai
 Even every Sanskrit word has been designated "dhataj"
