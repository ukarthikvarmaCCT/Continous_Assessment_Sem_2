 Perhaps the saying that applies to domesticated buffaloes also applies to buffalo standing buffalo instead of bean before buffalo

 Male cubs leave the herd at the age of two
 shavakon kaa janm aksar barish ke mausam ke ant main hota he
 Normally the female bison and cubs form the herd and the males live separately from the herd, but if a female of the herd is ready to conceive then the most powerful male does not allow any other male to come near her

 If the mother of a cub dies, other drugs take her
 inkaa swabhaavik shatru baagh he, par yadi junglee bhainsa kamjor boodha yaa biimaar ho to junglee kutton or tenduon ko bhi inkaa shikaar karte dekha gaya he
 However, their biggest danger is from the infectious diseases of domestic cattle, the main disease is foot and mouth
 ridanrpest naam kii beemaari ne ek samay inaki sankhya main bahut kami laa di thi
 The second major threat to them is genetic pollution, with bison establishing contact with domesticated buffalo
 haalanki flamand or tulaach jaise shodhakartao kaa maananaa he ki aam taur par junglee nar bhainsa paaltu nar bhainse ko maadaa ke paas nahin aane detaa par swayan paaltu maadaa bhainse se sampark kar letaa he par is vishay par abhi gaharaai se shodh kiya janaa baaki he
 The domesticated buffaloes of the areas where it is found in central India are also similar to them
 is baat ko ek mjedaar ghatana se samajha ja saktaa he
 a few years ago a team of Bombay Natural History Society along with Mr
 Raman Pandya, Forest Officer of Bijapur reached Indravati National Park to study and take pictures of wild buffaloes, saw a large herd of wild buffalo and took hundreds of pictures of them And one Mr
 who at that time was considered to be very knowledgeable of wild buffalo in the country, the rest of the people of bison and domesticated buffalo Ic busy explaining inter suddenly a shepherd and took Hank all buffaloes
 madhya bharat main junglee bhainson ke viluptata kii kagaar par pahunchne kaa ek pramukh kaaran uskaa vyahvaar he
 While Gaur goes to high places in the rain, the same wild buffalo live around the fields in the plains and cause great damage to the fields
 is kaaran gaanv vaale unka shikaar kar dete hai
 There is also a reason that the natural forests have been destroyed and replaced by trees like teak, sal, eucalyptus which meet the urban needs
 inamen se kuch ke pattey akhaadya he, inke neeche vah ghaas nahin ug paati jinako ye khate he, vaise bhi junglee bhainse bahut chuninda bhojan karti he
 Due to this also their conflict with the villagers has increased a lot
 takaraav badhane kaa ek kaaran yah bhi he, ki pehle adivasee berwa paddati se kheti karte the
 They did not have to work very hard in this
 jangal ke tukade jala kar uname bina hal chalaaye beej chhidak diye jate the
 The ash was a very good fertilizer
 paidaavaar bhi bahut acchhee mil jaati thi
 Apart from this, Kandamul and Phal were also found in abundance in the forests
 yada kada kiye jane vaale shikaar se bhi unhe bhojan kii kami nahin hoti thi
 They were not completely dependent on farming
 isaliye vanya praaniyon dwaara fasal main se kuch hissaa kha liye jane par iname bair bhav nahin aata tha
 And because of changing the place every two or three years, the grasslands used to become grasslands in the back
 vanya praaniyon ko chaare kii koi kami nahin hoti thi
 Therefore, their number of occasional hunts did not decrease
 ab chunki adivaasiyon ke paas sthai khet hai, jinaki urvartaa uttarottar kam hoti jaati he
 And plowing in them has to be done like weeding and applying fertilizer, which takes a lot of labor and money
 iske alaava kheton kii gheraabandi ke liye baans-balli or anya van utpaada lene kii ijaajat bhi nahin he, atah ab adivasee apni fasalon ke nuksaan par vanya praaniyon ke jaani dushman ho jate hai
 Due to all these reasons, wild buffaloes have come under the category of rarest animals today
 khayr yah sab ho chukaa he or is nuksaan kii bharpai karnaa hamaare bas main nahin he
 But there is one place which is untouched by the destruction of development till date
 vah jagah aaj bhi thik waisi he jaisaa prakruti ne use karodo saalon ke vikaas kram se banaaya he, jahaan aaj bhi berwa paddati se kheti hoti he or jahaan aaj bhi van bhainsa bade jhundo main shaan se vichrata dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan badi sankhya main baagh, bhaaluu, dhol, pahari maina or anek anya jaanavar shanti se apana apana jivan yaapan kar rahe hai
 Where thousands of species of vegetation, trees and plants, many of which have become extinct from the rest of India, are flourishing
 kareeb 5000 varg kilometre ke is swarg kaa naam he abujhmaad
 There are neither smoke-blowing factories nor mines blowing dust, nor are there roads through which destruction can reach here
 par yah sab kuch badalane vaala he or kuch to badal bhi chukaa he
 The so-called comrades of the tribals living here are holding guns
 hajaaro saalon tak swarg rahi is dharti par in swayambhu kamredon ne baroodon ke dher laga diye hai
 These people have laid such landmines on this picturesque land, which the security forces cannot differentiate between tribals and wildlife
 or sabase bade khed kii baat to yah he, ki jin yojanaon kaa dar dikhaa kar inhone adivaasiyon ko bhadkaaya tha, hamaari sarkaar aaj unheen ko lagu karne ja rahi he
 Mines are being allocated here without reaching Abujmad and without conducting any study
 or hamaare vanshajon kii is dharohar ko isaliye nahin barabaad kiya jaayegaa, ki desh main louh ayask kii koi kami he, balki is ayask ko niryaat karke pehle hi dhan kuber ban chuke khadaanapatiyon kaa laalach ab sari simaaen tod chukaa he or ve itane taqatvar ho chuke hai, ki ab ve netaaon ke nahin balki netaa unke ishaaron par naachte he
 Wildlife and tribals have no value in their eyes
 prakritik asantulan, global varming, nadiyon kaa pani viheen hona or akaal jaise shabdon kaa inase koi vaasta nahin
 As long as any place in the world is worth living, then they will have enough money to live happily
 inhi karatuuton se hamaare in jangalon main bachi hui junglee bhainson kii aabaadi bhi nasht ho jaayegi

 iskaa paalan karne waalon ko 'aghori' kehete hai
 Its originator is believed to be Aghornath Shiva himself
 rudra kii murti ko shwetashwataropanishad main aghora vaa mangalamayi kaha gaya he or unka aghor mantra bhi prasiddh he
 Abroad, especially in Iran, such old views are also known and some scholars of the West have also discussed them
 henry balfor kii khojon se vidit hua he ki is panth ke anuyaayi apane mat ko guru gorakhnath dwaara pravartit maanate hai, kintu iske pramukh prachaarak motinath hue jinke vishay main abhi tak adhik pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 Its three branches are famous by the names of Auaghar, Sarabhangi and Ghurre, the first of which was Kallusinh and Kaluram, who was the guru of Baba Kinaram
 kuch log is panth ko guru gorakhnath ke bhi pehle se prachlit batalaate hai or iskaa sambandh shaiva mat ke pashupat athwa kalamukh sampradaay ke saath jodate hai
 Baba Kinaram Aghori was born in the village of Samagarh in present-day Benaras district and lived in a depressed sense since childhood
 inhone pehle baba shivaraam vaishnav se diksha lee thi, kintu ve phir girnaar ke kisi mahatma dwaara bhi prabhavit ho gaye
 That Mahatma is often considered to be Guru Dattatreya, to whom he himself has made some signs
 ant main ye kaashi ke baba kaluram ke shishy ho gaye or unke ananthar krimikund par rahakar is panth ke prachaar main samay dene lage
 Baba Kinaram composed Viveksara, Gitavali, Ramgita etc

 He died in 1826
 baba kinaaraam ne is panth ke prachararth ramgarh, deval, hariharpur tathaa krimikund par kramash chaar mathon kii sthapana kii jinamein se chauthaa pradhan centre he
 This cult is also commonly called 'ouddhpant'
 ‘viveksaar’ is panth kaa ek pramukh granth he jisamen baba kinaaraam ne atmaram kii vandana or apane aatmanubhav kii charchaa kii he
 According to him, there is truth or Niranjan which is present in all wide and prevalent forms and whose existence is a simple form
 granth main un angon kaa bhi varnan he jinamein se pratham teen main sristirahasy, kaayaparichay, pindbrahmad, anahatnaad evam niranjan kaa vivaran he; agle teen main yoga sadhana, niraalamb kii sthiti, aatmavichaar, sahaj samadhi aadi kii charchaa kii gai he tathaa shesh do main sampurna vishwa ke hi aatmaswaroop hone or aatmasthiti ke liye dayaa, vivek aadi ke anusaar chalane ke vishay main kaha gaya he
 Among its followers are people of all castes

 People who associate themselves with this cult by referring to themselves as 'aghori' or 'aughdar', are mostly seen embalming, eating corpse, drinking liquor in its skull, and behaving in disgusting things, which is probably the influence of Kapalikas
 Ho
 inke madiraa aadi seven kaa sambandh guru dattatreya ke saath bhi joda jaataa he jinka madkalash ke saath utpann hona bhi kaha gaya he
 Aghori is also similar in some respects to the beleaguered Jogi Aughdars who are counted among the early seekers of Nathpanth and who have no connection with the Aghor sect
 inamen nirvaani or grihasth donon hi hote hai or inaki veshbhusha main bhi sade athwa rangeen kapade hone kaa koi kadaa niyam nahin he

 Many of these compositions are available in plenty and they also throw a lot of light on the ideology of this branch
 aghor panth ke praneta bhagwaan shiv maane jate hai
 It is said that Lord Shiva himself propounded the Aghor cult
 avadhoot bhagwaan dattatreya ko bhi aghorshastra kaa guru mana jaataa he

 Aghor Sadhanas are performed mainly at cremation ghats and uninhabited places
 shav sadhana ek vishesh kriya he jiske dwaara swayan ke astitv ke vibhinn charnon kii pratikatmak rup main anubhav kiya jaataa he
 According to the Aghor belief, the word Aghor is basically made up of two words 'A' and 'ghor' which means one who is not stoic which means easy and simple
 prayek maanav janmajaat rup se aghor arthath sahaj hota he
 As the child grows up, he learns to differentiate and later inside him evils and evils and he is no longer in his original nature ie Aghor
 aghor sadhana ke dwaara punah apane sahaj or mul rup main aa sakate hai or is mul rup kaa gyaan hone par hi moksh kii prapti sambhav he
 The practitioners of the Aghor sect wear a garland of male mundans for visualization and also use male mundas as characters

 The most common accessory for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, can also be used
 asthaayee rekhachitron ko blikeboard par yaa whitboard par yaa nihsandeh lagbhag har chiz par banaaya ja saktaa he
 This medium has also become a popular means of public expression through mural painting due to the accessibility of permanent markers
 rekhachitr, drishy abhivyakti kaa ek rup he or drishy kala ke antargat pramukh roopon main se ek he
 There are several subcategories of sketches, including cartoons
 rekhachitr ke kuch tareeke yaa drushtikon jaise, "dudling" or rekhachitr kii anya anaupchaarik vidhiyaan jaise bhaap snaan ke kaaran bane dhoomil darpan par chitra bananaa, yaa "intoptic graphomenia" kaa atiyathartwaadee tarika, jisamen sade kaagaj par ashuddhta ke sthanon par bindu banaae jate hai or phir in binduon ke bich rekhaaen banaai jaati hai, ise "fine arts" ke rup main "rekhachitr" kaa hissaa nahin bhi mana ja saktaa he
 Likewise tracing, drawing on a thin piece of paper, sometimes designed for the same purpose, around the outline of pre-existing shapes that look from this paper is not considered fine art, although it May be part of the preparation of draftsman
 'rekhachitr' ke liye angrezi ke shabd 'drawing' kaa prayog ek kriya or ek sangya, donon ke rup main kiya jaataa he: Drawing is usually concerned with marking the area of lines and tones on paper

 There are many different forms of jellyfish that represent various Nigerian classes including scyphozoa, storozoa, cubozoa and hydrozoa
 in samoohon main jelifish ko, kramshah, scyphomeduse, storomeduse, cubomeduse or hydromeduse bhi kaha jaataa he
 All jellyfish subspecies are embedded in medusozoa
 medusa jelifish ke liye ek or shabd he or isliye jivan-chakra ke vayask charan ke liye vishesh rup se prayukt hota he
 Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the depths of the ocean
 kuch hydrosoai jelifish, yaa hydromeduse tazaa pani main bhi paae jate hai; mithe pani kii prajatiyaan vyas main ek inch, berang hoti hai or dank nahin maarthi hai
 Many well-known jellyfish, such as Aurelia, are scyphomedusae
 ye bade, aksar rangeen jelifish hai, jo vishwa bhar main saamanytah tateey kshetron main paae jate hai
 In its broadest sense, the term jellyfish generally refers to members of the association Tinophora
 haalanki niderian jelifish se koi nikat sambandh nahin he, tinophor mukt-tairaaq planctonic mansabhakshi hai, jo saamanytah paardarshee yaa parbhasi or vishwa ke sabhi mahasaagaron ke uthle se gahare bhaagon main maujuud hote hai
 Lion mane jellyfish are the most well known jellyfish and, arguably, the tallest animal in the world
 chunki jelifish vastav main machhlee nahin hai, shabd jelifish ko mithyaa naam ke rup main mana jaataa he or america saarvajanik machhleegharon ne iske bajaay jelly yaa samudri jelly shabdon ke upyog ko lokapriy banaaya he
 Many other jellyfish, which have been in common practice for more than a century, are equally useful and picturesque and prefer the term more than jelly
 shabd jelifish kaa upyog kai alag prakaar ke niderian ko nirupit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jin sabamein chhatari ke samaan dikhne vaali ek buniyadi shaareerik sanrachana hoti he, jinamein shaamil hai scyphojoi, storosoi, hydrosoi or cubosoi jeev 
 Some textbooks and websites refer to scyphozoi as "real jellyfish"
 iske vyapak upyog main, kuch vaigyanik jab jelifish ko sanderbhit kar rahe hon, kabhi-kabhi sangh tinophora ke sadasyon ko shaamil karte hai
 Other scientists prefer to use the term "gelatinous zooplankton" when referring to them, with soft-bodied animals in the water column
 jelifish ke samooh ko kabhi-kabhi bloom yaa jhund bhi kaha jaataa he
 "bloom" is generally used for large groups of jellyfish that congregate in a small area, but may also include the time component, which is seasonal or greater than expected
 jelifish apane jivan-chakra ke swabhavanusaar "prasphutit" hote hai, jo dhoop or plankaton kii badhotaree par praayah apane nitalsth polip dwaara utpaadit hote hai, jisaki vajah se ve akasmaat prakat hote hai or aksar badi sankhya main, tab bhi jab paristhitiki tantra kaa santulan bana hua he

 kuch polip kabhi prachurodbhavit nahin hote or unhen "nihsang" upjati ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Jellyfish do not have specialized digestive, osmotic, central nervous, respiratory, or circulatory systems
 ve amashay-vaahikeey vivar ke jathar-twajeey astr kaa upyog karte hue, jahaan poshak tatwon kaa avasorana hota he, pachan karte hai
 They do not need the respiratory system because their skin is so thin that the body oxidizes by diffusion

 Ocean currents tend to collect jellyfish in large swarms or "blooms", which contain hundreds or thousands of jellyfish
 samudri dhaaraon dwaara kabhi-kabhi sankendrit hone ke alaava, prasphuton kuch saalon main asaamaanya rup se ucch aabaadi kaa bhi parinaam ho saktaa he
 Blasting formation is a complex process that is dependent on ocean currents, nutrients, temperature, sedimentation and oxygen concentrations
 jelifish apane pratiyogiyon kii tulana main kam oxigen vaale jal main behatar tareeqe se jivit rahane main sakasham hote hai or is tarah bina pratispardhaa ke plavak par pal sakate hai
 Jellyfish can also benefit from saline water, as salt water contains more iodine, which is necessary to convert polyps into jellyfish

 The global increase in jellyfish eruption frequency can be caused by human impact
 kuch sthanon par jelifish paristhitik aalon ko bhar sakate hai jis par pehle ab adhik machhliimaar jeevon kaa kabja tha, lekin note kiya gaya he ki is pariklpana main samarthak data kii kami he
 Jellyfish researcher Marsha Youngbluth further clarifies that "jellyfish nourish the same types of young and adult fish, so if the fish are removed from the equation, the jellyfish is likely to take place
" " Some jellyfish populations, which have shown a clear increase over the past few decades, are of other "invasive" species coming from natural habitats: examples include the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, the eastern Mediterranean beaches of Egypt and Israel, and Mexico
 American coast of the Gulf of
 Invasive species populations can expand rapidly as there are often no natural predators present in new habitats to prevent their growth
 zaruri nahin ki aise prasphuton adhik machhleemari yaa anya paryaavarniya samasyaon ko pratibimbit karen
 Increased nutrients, attributed to agricultural flow, have also been cited as the precursor to the jellyfish abundance

 The fact that jellyfish are growing is a sign that something is happening in the ecosystem
 " a sample of ocean life off the coast of Namibia suggests that as a result of heavy fishing in the region over the past few decades, jellyfish biomass has overtaken fish
 jelifish dwaara gambhirtha se prabhavit kshetron main shaamil hai uttari mexico khadi, jiske bare main graham kehete hai "moon jeliyon ne ek prakaar kaa shleshiya jaal gathit kiya he jo khadi ke ek chor se duusare chor tak failaa he
 " jelifish prasphuton maanav jati ke liye samasyaayein paidaa karata he
 The most obvious are human stings and tourism declines on the beaches

 The barrier also creates a number of problems including shutting down nuclear power plants and desalination plants, as well as disrupting ship engines and overturning boats by the largest species, the Nomura jellyfish
 anek jelifish apane jivan chakra ke dauraan do alag jivan itihaas charnon se guzarate hai
 The first is the polypoid stage, when the animal takes the shape of a small stalk with nutritive tentacles; This polyp can be localized, living on a lower surface or similar substratum, such as fetters or the bottom of a boat, or it is attached to small pieces of free-floating or free-gv plankton or rarely, to fish or other invertebrates
 it happens
 aam taur par polip main anthosoai or saath hi sangh nideria ke nikat sambandhi laghu polipon ke samaan urdhvamukhi sparshakon se ghira mukh hota he
 Polyps can be solitary or phylogenetic and some proliferate in different ways asexually, producing multiple polyps
 kai bahut chote hote hai, jinhen millimitron main mapa jaataa he
 In the second stage, small polyps asexually produce jellyfish, each of which is known as medusa
 chote jelifish polip se dur tair kar jate hai or phir plavak par badhate or poshit hote hai
 The medusa has a spherically symmetrical, umbrella-shaped body called a bell, usually consisting of small tentacles, such as bordered tentacles, on the side of the bell that hold the prey
 jelifish kii kuch prajatiyon ke jivan chakra main polip bhaag nahin hota he, lekin ve jelifish se nishechit andon ke sidhe vikaas ke madhyam se jelifish kii agali peedi main jate hai
 Jellyfish are monogamous, meaning they are usually male or female
 zyaadaatar maamalon main, donon aas-paas ke pani main shukranu or andey jari karte hai, jahaan andey nishechit hote hai or nae jeev main paripakv hote hai
 In some species, sperm swim into the female's mouth to fertilize eggs within the female's body where they are present during the early stages of development
 moon jelly main, andey maukhik bahon ke gaddhon main basate hai, jo vikasshil planula larva ke liye ek asthaayee bacchon kaa kaksh banataa he
 After fertilization and early development, the insectoid form called the planula develops

 It solidifies on the solid surface and develops into a polyp
 polip ek pyaale ke aakaar kaa hota he jiskaa ek mukh sparshakon se ghira hota he, jo chote samudrafool ke samaan dikhaai detaa he
 After the growth interval, polyp begin to asexually reproduce by eruption, and in scyphozoa it is called a segmented polyp, or scyphistoma

 Only scyphozoans belonging to the Rhizostome class are captured for food; About 12 of the 85 species are collected and sold in international markets
 adhikansh ekatrikaran dakshinpurv asia main sampann hota he
 Rhizostomes, especially Ropilema esculentum in China and Stomolophus milligris in the United States, are preferred because of their larger and more rigid body and their toxin is not harmful to humans

 Freshly processed jellyfish have a white, creamy color that turns yellow or brown during prolonged storage
 china main, sansaadhit jelifish ko raat bhar pani main bhigo kar vilwanikrut kiya jaataa he or pakaa kar yaa kaccha khaaya jaataa he
 Dishes are often cut and prepared with oil, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar, or served as a salad with vegetables

 In 1961, Osamu Shimomura of Princeton University, while studying the photoproteins that were the cause of the biopolarity by this species of jellyfish, extracted the green fluorescent protein from the large and abundant Hydromedusa equorea victoria and another bioremediated protein called equorin
 Three decades later, Douglas Prasher, a post-doctoral scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP
 sheeghra hi colombia vishvavidhyalay ke martin chelfi ne pataa lagaaya ki kaise GFP ko anya koshikaon yaa angon main jin ke fluoroscent marker ke rup main sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Roger Sian of the University of California, San Diego later chemically manipulated GFP to acquire other fluorescence colors to be used as markers
 In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfi and Sian won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on GFP
 maanav nirmit GFP kaa ab saamanytah pradipt tag yah darshane ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he ki koun-si koshikaayen yaa utak vishisht jeenon ko vyakt karte hai

 In a cell or animal, the synthetic gene is generated in the same tissues as the normal gene and at the same time
 lekin saamaanya protein banane ke bajaay, jin GFP banaata he
 This can then be done by flashing light on the animal and observing the illumination to determine which tissues can express that protein - or at what stage of development
 Fluorescence refers to where the gene is expressed
