 Belief in Islamic theology refers to a believer's belief in the spiritual aspects of Islamic theology
 isaki sabase saral paribhaasha vishwaas ke chah lekhon main vishwaas he, jise "arkan al-imaan" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It means faith in the six themes of Islam's faith
 imaan shabd quran or haddees-e-jibril donon main chitrit kiya gaya he
 According to the Quran, Imaan must be accompanied by religious deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into heaven
 jibril kii haddees main, islamic dharm ke ayaamon kaa nirmaan yah teen karte hai "islam" "ihasaan" or "imaan"
 Within and outside Islam, religion is discussed for faith and purpose, and the relative importance of both cannot be forgotten
 kai vidwaanon kaa tark he ki ek hi strot or jagah se vishwaas or hetu donon utpann hote hai isliye donon ko saamanjasypurna hona chahie
 In Arabic, Iman, the pronunciation means "faith"
 yah kriya sangya he, آمن, matlab kisi chiz main vishvas rakhana
 In the Hadith, Muhammad Sahib defined as "the meaning of Iman - wisdom in the heart, voice on the tongue, and activity in the hands and feet"
 vishwaas ek bharosa he sachai par jo vaastavik he
 When people believe, they attach themselves to that truth
 sachai jaananaa hi kaaphi nahin he, dil use maananaa bhi chahie, jeebh dwaara vyakt kii jaani chahie jo buddhi kii abhivyakti he or ant main unke aatmavishvaas ko pratibimbit karne ke liye us kaa amal karnaa bhi zaruri he
 Hamiduddin Farahi, in his tafsir, explaining the meaning of Iman, wrote: vishwaas aam taur par vishwaas ke chah lekhon kaa upyog karke ullikhit he: The first of these is mentioned by the Qur'an and the first five by Muhammad, while a doctrine of belief in Allah - the good and the bad of God-ordered destiny - refers to all six in the following way in the Hadith of Gabriel: mohammad se bhi ek or samaan varnan he: "ibn Abbas narrated that Malak Jibril once asked the Prophet:" Tell me what is Iman? "the Prophet replied:" Iman is to believe in Allah, on the Day of Judgment, on His Malaika, books and prophets, And to believe in life after death, and to believe in heaven and hell, and on the establishment of the Mizan which is to weigh our karma, and believe in destiny, on its good and evil
 jibril ne phir un se poocha: "yadi main yah sab karata hum to main imaan ke saath rahoonga?" paigambar ne kaha: " jab aapane yah sab kiya he, to aap imaan main honge
 " yah bhi mana jaataa he ki aavashyak imaan main pehle 3 chize hoti hai 
 In the Quran, one of the 10 virtues is Imaan which one gets due to becoming the recipient of Allah's mercy and reward
 quran kahata he ki vishwaas allaah ke samaran ke saath bad saktaa he
 The Quran also says that in this world there should be nothing but faith that is dear to Momin
 mohammad ne kaha he ki; usne vishwaas kii mithaas praapt kii jo allaah ko ishwar islam ko dharm or mohammad ko paigambar ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 He also said that no one can be a true believer until he loves the Prophet more than his children, parents and relatives
 ek or udhaaharan main, unhone tippanee kii he ki yah allaah or mohammad ke saath prem karne ke baad hi ek vyakti vishwaas ke asli swaad se avgat ho saktaa he
 Amin Ahsan Islahi, one of the Quran's emissaries, has clarified the nature meaning of this love: 

prem keval kisi kii patni, bacchon or anya rishtedaaron ke liye swaabhaavik rup se bhavuk pyaar kaa sanket nahin detaa he, balki yah kuch drushtikon or buddhi or siddhanton ke aadhaar par prem ko bhi sanderbhit karata he
 It is because of this love that a person, in every sphere of life, gives priority to this attitude and principle
 agar vyakti apanai patni, bacchon or rishtedaaron kii maang is drushtikon kii maangon se juujhati he, to vah bina kisi hichkhichahat ke is kaa paalan karata he, isi imaani prem ke kaaran uski patni or bacchon kii ichchhaaon or unke parivaar or kabeeley kii maangon ko kam kar detaa he
 Both Islahi and Maududi have speculated that the Quran's comparison of a good word and a bad word in chapter 14 is actually a comparison of faith and unbelief
 is prakaar, quran prabhavi rup se ek ped par vishwaas kii tulana kar rahaa he jisaki jaden mitti main gahari hai or akaash kii vishalata main shakhaaen faili hui hai
 There is also the subject of a prayer made by Iman Muhammad to Allah: he allaah! maine apane aap ko thukraayaa he or khud ko aap ke hawaale saunp diya he, or main ne aapaki badhaai pahchaan kar pehle aapke sharan main aagaya hoon, aap se bhaag kar kahin bhi sharan milane vaala nahin he
 If you are with anyone then prabhu! maine aapaki pustak main vishwaas kiya he jise aapane prakat kiya he or paigambar main vishwaas kiya he jise aapane paigambaron ke rup main bheja he
 Imam al-behiqi has compiled in his book Shu'ab al-iman that there are 77 branches of faith
 isamen, vah imaan ke aavashyak gunon ko samajhaate huve kurani aaayaaton or nabi kii hadison kaa ullekh kiya he, jo vishvas ko darshaate hai
 The following hadith is based on Muhammad Sahib: abu huraira ne suna he ki paigambar ne kaha tha: "imaan main 70 se adhik shakhaaen hai
 The most excellent of these branches is to read "la Ilaha Ilallah", and the shortest branch is to remove the obstacle read in the way
 or haya imaan kii ek mahatvapurn shakha he
 " islam main, yah aavashyak he ki vishwaas or karmon ke bich sadbhaav or samanvay maujuud ho
 Farahi has explained this aspect in his tafsir in the following way: vishwaas ke baad quran main dharmik karmon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he 


 vishwaas ke maamle main, isaki vyakhya kii aavashyaktaa spasht he: vishwaas kii jagah dil or buddhi he
 In matters of intelligence and heart, not only can a person deceive others but sometimes he himself can be deceived
 vah khud ko ek mumin maanata he jabaki vastav main vah nahin he
 For this reason, it requires two evidences: a person's words and a person's deeds
 chunki shabd asaty ho sakate hai, isliye ek vyakti jo keval shabdon ke madhyam se vishwaas kaa daawa karata he use muman ke rup main nahin mana jaataa he or ise aavashyak samajha jaataa tha ki ek vyakti ke karm bhi uske vishwaas kii gavaahi den
 Thus the Quran said: o you believe with the tongue! Trust through your actions
 islam main tark or vishwaas ke bich sambandh sadiyon se faili ek jatil bahes he
 Ismail Raji al-farooqi explains on this subject: gaiyr-musalmaan islam ke siddhanton kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 However, they should be aware that Islam does not offer its doctrines specifically to those who believe or want to believe
 islam is ko tarksangat rup se, tarksangat rup se pesh karata karata he
 It introduces us to the necessary grounds with logical and consistent arguments
 vyaktigat swaad, yaa vyaktiparak anubhav ke saapeksh aadhaar par asahmat hona hamaare liye vaid nahin he

 Although the queen of the bee lives for many years, intercourse occurs only once, and at one time sufficient quantities of sperm are reached to impregnate its eggs throughout life
 maithun ke pashchaat nar kii sheeghra hi mrityu ho jaati he
 Many insect males copulate with isolated females multiple times in their lives, and both male and female copulate repeatedly with many castes
 andey saadharantaya bahut chote hote hai
 Nevertheless, it is often possible to tell the egg which kind of insect will emerge from the egg
 bahudhaa yah baat bahut mahatv rakhti he, kyonki isse hanikaarak kiton kii hanikaarak dasha ke vishay main bhavishyavaanee kii ja sakati he
 Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the shape, form and color of eggs and the place and method of laying eggs
 andey samtal, shalkyakar, golakaar, shankvakar tathaa chaude ho sakate hai
 The upper shell of the egg is completely smooth or with a variety of markings
 andey pruthak pruthak yaa samudaayon main rakhe jate hai
 The eggs of oilseeds reside within the ovum
 jalawaasi kiton ke andey chipchipe lasadaar padaarth se dhake rahete hai
 Enlargement of the egg is found in sufficient quantity to feed the fetus, called a yoke
 andaropan vibhinn prakaar se hota he
 Eggs are laid in such places where the immediate requirements of the offspring can be fulfilled
 kuch jatiyon kii maadaaen nichi udaan udati, apane andey aniyamit reeti se giraati chali jaati hai
 The females of many moths, whose eggs eat grass or its roots, keep dropping their eggs on the grass while flying
 saadharantaya andey aise paudhon par rakhe, paudhon ke utakon main pravisht kar die jate hai jinako dimbh khate hai, jaise kuch prakaar ke tiddon main
 Some insects lay their eggs in the soil
 parashrayi jatiyon ke keet apane andon ko un poshakon ke upar yaa bheetar rakhte hai, jo unki santanon kaa poshan karte hai
 Females of different castes have different numbers of eggs
 drumayuka kii kuch jatiyon kii maadaaen sheetkaal main keval ek hi bada anda rakhti hai
 The domestic fly lays more than 2,000 eggs in its life
 dimak kii rani main anda rakhane kii shakti sabase adhik hoti he
 It can lay one egg per second and lays 10,00,000 eggs in its six to twelve years of life
 andey ke sansechan ke pashchaat parivardhan aarambh ho jaataa he
 Initially a two-legged root band or germ band is formed, which is divided into twenty eggs by transverse lines
 agle chah khand sir, parvarti teen khand vaksh or shesh khand telson ke saath milakar udar banaate hai
 In addition to the first segment and the telson, a paired embryonic component develops in each segment
 avyavon ke pratham yugma kaa sambandh dwitiya khand se rahata he or inase shringikas banati hai
 The second pair is very short and transient
 teesri, chauthi or paanchavi jodi ke avyav viksit hokar mandible, mexila or labium ban jate hai
 The three pair of components behind them are somewhat large and clear
 ye taangon ke agravarti he
 The last pair of abdominal components become sarsai, but all the remaining pairs are usually destroyed before they reach the ovum
 andey se baccha nikalnaa-bhrun jab purna reeti se viksit ho jaataa he or andey se baahar nikalne ko taiyaar hota he, tab shukti main pehle se bani hui topi ko apane anda phodne vaale kaanton se hataakar baahar nikal aata he
 Initially in some insects, the fetus swallows air and increases its expansion so much that the secretion is broken
 bachche ko baahar nikalne main uski peshiyaan sahaayta karti hai
 Growth begins only after hatching
 janm se praudhata tak keet ke aakaar main jo vruddhi hoti he vah atyadhik aashcharya janak he
 The adult insect weighs between 1,000 and 70,000 times the birth weight
 itani adhik vruddhi aise khol ke bheetar, jiskaa vistaar bad nahin saktaa, nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, breaking of the shell is very important
 yah kentul ke patan se hi sambhav he
 Chronic externality is called snakeskin
 jeern bahyatvak ke fatne se purv hi iske bhitaravaale adhicharm kii koshikaaye naveen bahyatvak kaa utsarjan kar detii hai
 Then some of these special types of cells, which are called snake glands, produce a fluid substance
 yah drav padaarth puraane bahyatvak ke bhitari str ko villin kar nae bahyatvak se pruthak kar detaa he, isko komal bhi bana detaa he tathaa swayan puraane or nae bahyatvak ke madhya ek maheen jhilli si ban jaati he
 At such a time, the insect grows
 kentul patan ke pashchaat keet kii akruti ko instar kehete hai
 When the insect comes out of the egg, the first instar occurs, after the first snake fall the insect is the second instar, the last instar is called the complete insect or adult insect
 adhiktar kiton main andey se jo dimbh nikalataa he uski akruti or rup vayask keet se bahut bhinn hota he
 Many insects undergo many changes until they become mature in shape and form
 is prakaar ke parivartanon ko roopantaran kehete hai
 Pests that do not convert are called conversionless
 iskaa udhaaharan leha he
 Most insects undergo metamorphosis, and such pests are called metabolites
 kiton main do prakaar ke kriyasheel apraudh paae jate hai
 These are called nymph and egg
 ninf us apraudh avasthaa ke keet ko kehete hai jo andey se nikalne par adhik unnat hota he
 The differentiation of nymph from the complete insect is that it does not develop side and external gonads
 ye sthal par rahete hai or pakshon kaa vikson bahya rup se hota he
 The growth from nymph to complete insect is gradual and does not form pupa
 is prakaar ke parivartan kaa apurna roopantaran tathaa keet samudaay ko hemimetabola kehete hai, jaise eekh kii pankhi
 The ovum is very different from that of the late stage insect
 isamen pakshon kaa koi bhi bahya chinh nahin paaya jaataa
 The ovum has to become a pupa before it becomes a complete insect
 is prakaar ke parivartan ko purna roopantaran kehete hai, jaise gharelu makkhi main
 Minor insects have overrepresentation
 in dambhon main dimbh avasthaa main bhi atyadhik parivartan paaya jaataa he
 They have four or more apparent instars
 inke jivan or vyavhaar main bhi bahut bhed paaya jaataa he
 This type of transformation is called a hyper transformation, as in cantharis
 kiton main roopantaran ke niyaman kaa do hormonon se sambandh hota he- kentul patan kaarak hormone or shishav hormone
 Derm-degeneration hormone often excretes the thoracic gland
 yah hormone keet kaa kentulapatan karata he
 In adult, the thoracic gland disappears, so the dermis also ends
 yadi ninf kii vakshiya granthi praudh main jamaa di jaae to praudh bhi kentulapatan karne lagegaa
 Infant hormones emit corpora alata
 yah hormone praudh ke lakshanon ko dabaae rakhata he or ninfon ke lakshanon ke tivrata se ubhaadne main sahaayta karata he
 The reactivity of the thoracic gland increases at the time of conversion, and the effect of its hormone is sufficient enough that infancy crushes the effect of hormones and thus conversion occurs
 nead jalawaasi or bahut kriyasheel apraudh hote hai
 Their breathing stops
 shwasan jalashvasanikaaon dwaara hota he
 These are campodyiformes, that is, the legs are well developed and the body is flat
 dimbh holometabolas or hypermetabolas kiton kii ek apraudh avasthaa he
 When the eggs hatch, their growth conditions may vary according to different species
 inaki yah dasha kuch ansh tak yoke kii maatra par, jo inaki vruddhi ke liye andey main upasthit rahata he, nirbhar rahati he
 It has often been seen that when the egg has a small amount of yoke, the ovum is more imperfect when it comes out of the egg
 dimbh chaar prakaar ke hote hai protopod dimbh par jivi kalapakshon main paae jate hai, kyonki inke andon main yoke atyalp maatra main hota he
 These eggs are almost in embryonic state
 inkaa jivit rahanaa isliye sambhav hota he ki yaa to ye anya kiton ke andon main yaa unke sharir ke bheetar rahete hai, jahaan inako vruddhi karne ke liye atyadhik pushtikar bhojan miltaa he
 There are no segments or any type of components found in their abdomen
 polipod yaa irusiform dimbhon ke sharir main spasht khand or udar par avyav bhi hote hai
 The horns are more existing, but smaller
 ye apane bhojan ke sameep rahete hai or is kaaran aalsee hote hai
 Such eggs are called caterpillars and are found in butterflies, moths and safflowers

 obtect arthath kavchit pupa ke paksh or taange sharir se chipki rahati hai
 There is no progress in them
 is prakaar ke pun adhiktar shalbhon main paae jate hai
 In the coarctate pupa, the last snout of the ovum does not collapse, but this snake becomes stiff and becomes the piperium outside the pupa
 is prakaar kaa pupa gharelu makkhi main paaya jaataa he
 The insects break their shells in different ways while leaving the puparium
 chabaakar khaane vaale keet apane jambh se apane puparium ko kutar-kutar kar baahar nikalate hai
 Suckle feeding insects emit a fluid, which softens the silk of the Koya from one side and breaks down spontaneously
 kuch shalki-pakshon main kaante hote hai, jinase ve puparium main daraar banaate he
 Some bipedes have a pouch on their head, filling the air in which they press the end of the puparium
 is prakaar yah sira tut jaataa he or makkhi nikal aati he
 When coming out of the puparium, the insect first excretes its contents
 is samay iske pag sikude hote hai, phir rengkar sabase sameep yah jo bhi avlamb paa jaataa he us par isi dasha main vishram karne lagata he
 The sides also spread quickly due to the bleeding of the body in the sides and by the shrinking and spreading of muscles
 puparium se nikalne ke kuch samay pashchaat hi keet udne kaa praytn karne lagata he
 Addition of complete pests In pests with incomplete conversion, changes in the pests of complete pests are gradual and varied
 ye bahya tathaa aantarik donon hote hai
 The senses of Renif are transformed into the senses of Purnakit
 iske aakaar main vruddhi ke atirikt bahut hi thodaa anya parivartan aata he
 In insects with complete conversion, the senses and tissues of the ovum merge in varying degrees in the state of the pupa
 is vidhi ko hystolysis kehete hai
 At the same time, the senses of the adult are formed in their place
 naveen utakon kaa yah utpaadan histoginesis kehalaata he
 Both types of changes keep happening simultaneously without destroying the indisposition of senses
 vastav main purnakit kaa bananaa dimbh main hi aarambh ho jaataa he
 First of all, buds of complete pests are formed
 ye kalikas bhavishya main hone vaale keet ke un sab bhaagon kaa, jinaki isko aavashyaktaa hogi, punarniman karti hai tathaa un sab indriyon ko bhi banaati hai jo dimbh main nahin pai jaati
 Many insects continue to grow under diapause ie, growth-friendly conditions
 is bich yadi koi pratikul paristhiti aa jaati he, jaise nimna taap; to kuch samay ke liye parivardhan ruuk jaataa he, kintu paristhiti sudharte hi parivardhan turant hi phir aarambh ho jaataa he
 But there are many insects in which external conditions seem favorable
 kintu kuch nishchit paristhitiyon ke kaaran parivardhan ruuk jaataa he
 This growth spurt can range from a few weeks to several years
 vibhinn jatiyon ke kiton main yah avadhi praaia: bhinn hoti he or is prakaar parivartan main vilamb ho jaataa he
 But in the end this blockage occurs only at a certain stage of history by the organism
 yah avasthaa andey kii, apurna keet kii, yaa vayask kii, kisi kii bhi ho sakati he or keet kii jati par nirbhar rahati he
 The silkworm, Bambix morai, which lays eggs in autumn, contains diapause
 jab tak garmi dene se pehle inke centegrade par na rakhaa jaay in andon se dimbh nahin nikalate
 Winter life is found in the life cycle of insects of temperate and cold countries
 in dinon keet shithil rahata he
 In countries of epigraphy, where the climate is always warm and moist, the inactivity of insects is often not found in the biotic cycle, and after one generation the second generation comes in chronological order

 They only know their instrument in adulthood
 praaia: nar keet hi sambhavat: maadaa ko aakarshith karne ke liye sangeet utpann karte hai
 Their instruments are mostly of the shape of a drum, that is, these instruments have a membrane in which the sound is produced by intense vibration
 kampan utpann karne kii do vidhiyaan he
 The sound that is produced by rubbing one part over another
 uski bela se utpann hui dhwani se tulana kar sakate hai
 The second method involves the release of shrinkage of the muscles of the insect

 Their entry into the plants depends on the particular condition of the plant
 anek keet anek paudhon par, yaa ek hi varg kii anek jatiyon ke paudhon par, akraman karte hai
 Generally, the plant of each species of insect remains fixed, and many insects do not eat any plant other than plants of the scheduled caste, even if they die
 bahut se kiton or paudhon kaa sambandh anyonya hota he
 Such moths visit flowers to obtain pollen and makaranda
 in vastuon ko praapt karte samay agyaan main hi ye pushparagan kar dete hai
 Often special types of creations are found in insects receiving food from flowers

 This type of behavior is found in insects of different classes
 inkaa shikaar koi anya keet, yaa aprishthvanshi jeev hota he
 Due to such life many changes take place in the legs, mouth parts and sensory senses of these insects
 aise kuch kiton ke vyavhaar main bhi spasht pavirthan drushtigochar hota he
 Some insects use their legs to catch their prey and to pause while eating
 vyaadh patang apni teenon jodi taange or jalmatkun tathaa mantid keval bagali taangon kaa hi is kaary main upyog karte hai
 This causes a change in their legs

 jalpaksh ke kuch dimbh apane shikaar, chintiyon, ko pakadaney ke liye gaddha banaate hai
 Parasites are pests that subsist on other organisms, but receive food from them without killing them and often depend on the same nutrient
 ye apane andey praaia: apane poshak ke sharir par dete hai
 There are two types of parasitic insects - one that survives on vertebrates and the other on insects and their relatives
 pratham varg ke keet anoplura, mellophayga or cyphonaptera ganon tathaa hippobosidi vansh ke antargat aate hai
 These parasites are very small compared to their nutrient
 poshak main inako sahane karne kii shakti viksit ho jaati he or is kaaran inkaa prabhaav prananashak nahin hota
 Most of these are excellent parasites and live on the body of the nutrient
 cyphonaptera ke atirikt anya kaa sharir upar neeche se chauras hota he or ye poshak ke sharir se chipke rahete hai
 They have hooks to hold the nutrient on their feet and the eyes become weak or fading
 pakshon kaa bhi praaia: abhaav rahata he or yadi ve hote bhi he to bahut chote hote hai
 There are only a few parasites of insects
 strepsyptus gana ke atirikt madhumakhi kii juun, breula hi keval inkaa anya udhaaharan he
 The behavior of semi-parasites is similar to that between parasitic and parasitic
 aarambh main yah paraseete kii tarah rahata he, arthath poshak kii ati aavashyak indriyon ko nasht nahin karata, kintu baad main iskaa vyavhaar apahari jaisaa ho jaataa he or yah apane poshak kaa bhakshan kar jaataa he
 It usually lays its eggs above or inside the body of the nutrient
 iske dimbh poshak se sthaayee rup se chipke rahete he or apana bhojan poshak ke sharir ke bheetar yaa baahar se praapt karte hai
 Mostly these insects are found only in the Tachinidis of the bipedal lineage and in the Parasitica class of the genus Aap
 inke praudh kriyasheel hote hai or parashrayi nahin hote
 The size of a semi-parasite is larger than the size of a nutrient and by its behavior it always destroys the nutrient
 poshak adhiktar anya keet hi hote hai, jinke andon yaa anya apraudh avasthaaon par ardhparasite kaa akraman hota he
 Adult pests are never attacked
 texnidi vansh ke keet poshak ke bheetar rahete hai, kintu andey poshak ke upar, yaa poshak se dur, rakhte hai
 Many parasites are like external parasites, but most are internal parasites and lay their eggs within the skin of the nutrient
 ardhparajiviyon main sabase adhik mahatv kii baat inke shwasanatantr main pai jati he, vishesh karke aantarik ardhparajiviyon main, jo apane poshak ke rakt main mili hui oxijan kaa shwasan karte hai
 But there are some internal semi-parasites as well
 jo sidhe vayumandal se oxygen praapt karte hai
 Some insects do not feed on other insects, but eat away their collected material

 atelura naamak keet chitiyon ke vivaron main rahata he or jab ek cheentee duusari cheentee ko apana ulti kiya hua bhojan dene lagati he to usko pi letaa he
 There are also pests that benefit their nutrients in exchange for being with them
 kuch kanchukpaksh chitiyon ke vivaron main aashray or bhojan pate hai or iske badale main apane sharir se srav nikaal kar dete hai, jisko paane ke liye ye chitiyaan bahut lalayit rahati hai
 The last category of this relationship is that the ants actually feed the guest skeletal in exchange for secretions
 paraspar laabh pahunchaane kaa yah ek sundar udhaaharan he 
 Most insects have a habit of living alone, but insects of some castes form their own circle under the given circumstances
 sheetkaal main jab taap bahut neeche gir jaataa he, gharelu makkhiyaan praaia: ek saath ekatra ho jaati hai
 Some caterpillars are gregarious and all born bred together live together in the same webs, but such circles disperse as soon as the meal ends and each cull begins to remain independent
 bahut se keet anek paristhitiyon se vivash ho greeshmakaal bitaane, pupa banane or sheet nishkyita ke liye ekatra ho jate hai
 One of these situations is the search for a safe place
 kiton kii mandali main rahane kii prakruti ke kaaran paraseete or apahari shatruon se tathaa pratikul paristhitiyon se inaki sambhavat: raksha ho jaati he
 Some of the defense is done by being in the herd and active in traveling herders
 tiddiyaan or titiliyaan prvrajan ke samay yuthchara ban jaati hai
 a lonely fox named Helictus makes small rooms around the mouth of a tunnel built in the ground
 in kamaron main bhojan or ek ek anda rakh detii he, tatpashchaat inaki raksha karti rahati he
 It is also alive till the time the eggs are released from the eggs
 vah keet, jo apni santanon kii kam se kam unke jivan ke aarambh main dekhbhaal karata he, saamaajik jivan kii pratham shrenee kaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Social insects of different classes have different traits, but the most important feature of each of their congregations is that there is only one family, consisting of a male, a female and their offspring, or a mating female and its offspring
 , Ie, at least two generations live together in one place
 vaastavik saamaajik jivan bara, madhumakhiyon, chitiyon or dimakon main paaya jaataa he
 
 ek anya prakaar kaa sahjivan he jisamen ek keet duusare keet ke sharir par chipka rahata he
 The insects that stick on the body are usually large, but small insects do not eat them, that is, they do not cause any harm
 miloidi vansh ke triangulin dimbh ko saamaajik kalapaksh apane sharir par apane ghonslen main le jate hai
 These eggs eat their offspring there
 silionidi vansh ke kuch paraseete, maadaa tiddon kii peeth par, baith jate hai
 The grasshoppers lay on their backs until they lay eggs
 ant main apane andey tiddon ke andon main pravisht kar dete hai
 The most beautiful example is the botfly
 maadaa makshika apane andon ko machhar kii taangon or sharir par chipka detii he or jab machhar rakt chusane manushya ke paas pahunchataa he tab in andon main se dimbh nikalakar apane poshak manushya par akraman kar dete hai
 a large number of insects live in water
 ye adhiktar mithe pani main rahete hai, kuch khaare pani or samudr main bhi paae jate hai
 Many symptoms of these pests are useful
 bahut se kalapakshon kii chikani or chamakati hui deh tairte samay pani kii rukaawat kam kar detii he
 Many insects have special means to keep them from flowing into the waterfowl, such as the black flies holding the silk threads
 machharon ke dimbhon main shwasaradhran ke chaaron ore pai janevaali grathiyon se tel mila hua srav nikalataa he
 Due to this, the external properties of these places have hydrological properties and water cannot stay there
 at: shwasan berok tok hota rahata he
 Some insects, such as Poudura aquatica, have hair that causes the extracellular hydrocephalus
 is gun ke kaaran shwasapranal main jal nahin pravesh kar paata
 They also have special means for obtaining food, for example, in the nymphs of Odineta, the veil of labium acts as a trap
 machharon ke dimbhon ke mukhon main compankaaree burush hote hai jo jal main lehren utpann karte hai or is prakaar bhojan ke sookshmakan inaki grasika main pahanch jate hai
 The hind legs of the dietiscus form the hull

 They respire through the trachea, reservoir, or blood reservoir
 kuch keet vaayu ko apane paas jamaa kar lete hai or jab ve jal main duube hote hai tab uskaa upyog karte hai
 The trachea system of the transparent ovum of the insect called the cortex of the biceps becomes a pair of bean-shaped pairs
 ye theliyaan utplavan indriya kaa kaary karti hai
 This ovum can change the volume of these bags by some unknown method and thus can generate relative master speed according to the depth of water
 keet saare sansar main, himachhadit dhruviya bhaagon se lekar bumadhya rekha ke pasavaale, tapate hue bhaagon tak main paae jate hai
 Their distribution is more extensive than all other terrestrial organisms
 ye lagbhag un sabhi sthanon main paae jate hai jahaan vanaspatiyaan ug sakati hai, arthath jahaan bhi inako bhojan praapt ho saktaa he
 Vegetables are the food of insects and other organisms
 paksh ek mahaan mahatvavaali rachana he
 Insects have incomparable distribution power, which is not found in other terrestrial organisms
 vitaran kii shakti kiton kii prayek jati ko teevr spardhaa se or kathor nirvachan ke prabhaav se, jiskaa parinaam parimit kshetra main atyadhik bheed hona hota he, bachane ke liye swatantraaa pradaan karti he, kintu bahut se keet aise bhi hai jinka vitaran simit he
 Oil pests, rice truncated insects, pulses pests etc
 are famous among insects found in the houses of humans all over the world
 inke atirikt aajkal chane kaa shalab, aalu k shalab, shakarkand kaa suundwala keet or bandgobhi kaa shalab, bhi saare sansar main paae jate hai
 Similarly, there are many such pests that are found only in a particular state or country
 aisa vitaran bahut si paristhitiyon par nirbhar rahata he
 Feeding and natural conditions are undoubtedly very effective conditions
 jalawaasi keet vahaan nahin rah sakate jahaan jal nahin he
 Insects living in the bark of trees cannot be found in places where there is no tree
 prakritik avrodh, jaise unche unche pahaad, samudr tathaa marusthal, kiton kaa vitaran ek desh se duusare desh main nahin hone dete
 Some insects, such as safilize, cabbage butterfly, etc
 are found only in the temperate zone
 falon kii makkhiyaan, dhan ke keet aadi keval ayanvrutt main hi milte hai
 Some insects, such as locusts and some butterflies, sometimes have a propensity to migrate and reach far-off countries
 kintu bahut se kiton ke aadhunik vitaran kii vyakhya prithvi kii aadhunik dasha or jalwaayu ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati or isliye praaia: bhouvrittiya parivartanon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 The insect called Spring Tail is found in New Zealand and Chile
 isse yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi kaal main in donon deshon ke bich atactic mahadweep failaa hua tha, kyonki yah keet itnaa komal or pakshaheen he ki iskaa anya kisi prakaar se vitaran ho hi nahin saktaa
 Spring tail has the most extensive distribution compared to other insects and due to this it has adapted itself to these different conditions
 chitiyon kaa bhi lagbhag isi prakaar vitaran he or inhone bhi apane ko vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anukool kar liya he
 The Bear, in 1954-55, stated that the eggs of Miriapoda who can breed in the embryo should be considered as ancestors of insects
 yah siddh karne ke liye kiton ke praudh or kuch miriapoda ke dimbhon kii, udaahranarth, aiulas kii, jo ek milipid he, tulana karne main mahatpurna hai
 When the egg of the ileus emerges from the egg, its head appears to be composed of as many segments as the head of the insect
 sharir ke shesh bhaag main lagbhag 12 khand hote hai, jinamein se pratham teen khandon main prayek par ek jodi taange hoti hai
 Fourth and the sections behind them are also without legs
 kintu inke parivardhan main rukaawat aa jaati he or ye bahut hi chote rah jate hai
 In this way, the ovum of this six-legged ileus becomes a long adult at the end, which has many segments and many legs in the body
 yadi is dimbh kii pratham teen jodi ke pashchaatwali taangon ke parivardhan main adhik rukaawat ho or dimbh ke sharir ke lagbhag 12 khand praudhavastha main drudh rahen to yah jeev keet ke aakaar kaa hoga, jisamen pratham teen jodi taangon ke pechhevali taange yaa to itani ksheen hongi ki keval unke avshesh hi honge yaa ve sarvatha lupt hongi
 It is very interesting that in fact there are pests in which even the remains of the legs are present on the abdomen, such as Campodia, Japix and Matilis
 in kiton ke paksh nahin hote or inamen ve rachanaaen vartmaan rahati hai jo anya kiton main lupt ho gai hai, jaise janangranthiyon kaa khandibhavan
 Therefore, in the development of insects, these insects should understand the mid stage condition of the eggs and other insects born in the brain of Miriapoda
 anya anek tarkon se bhi yah anumodith hota he ki miriapoda kii tarah kii akritiyon se hi kiton kii utpatti hui he
 It is highly likely that myriapoda are the ancestors of insects in all those long-bodied and tangled organisms, because they contain many of the same creations, for example, malpigian tubules and tracheal tubules
 kintu iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki kiton kii utpatti praudh miriapoda se nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki inamen bahut si visheshtaayen or vilakshantaayen hai
 The Aperigota subclass is a group of mostly diverse insects and only the Thysanurae ganas of that subclass are probably close to the main category of growth of Terrigote insects
 aisa tark dwaara siddh kiya gaya he ki aptarigota ke shesh teen ganon ko keet maananaa hi nahin chahie
 However, there does not seem to be any satisfactory reason to separate these three ganas from this subclass, although there is no doubt that they exhibit unique compositions, for example the pests of Collenbola gana have only nine segments
 protura gana ke kiton main enamorphosis hota he, diplura, gana ke kiton main alakshanik trekial tantra paaya jaataa he, diplura or colembala kii shringikaaon ke kashabh main peshiyaan hoti hai
 The subclass Terrigota is divided into two parts - exopterigota and endopterigota
 exopterigota ganon ke affimeroptera or odoneta main paraspar nikat sambandh he, kyonki ye donon hi peliapteron, gana hai
 Blatteria, Mantodia, Isoptera, Joreptra, Gyloblatodia, Rhe Jupaj, Phaseamidea, Plicoptera, Dermaptera and Ambioptera r Jupaxica orthopteraid belong to the community, if considered from the body theory of modern insects
 nimnlikhit lakshanon ke kaaran ye sab gun ek samudaay banaate hai-aparivartit mukhbhaag, pashchapaksh main vishaal anelle lob udar ke pasch sire par ek jodi sarasai, aganit mailipagian nalikaayeor pratiprishth tantric tantu main kai ek pruthak-pruthak gucchhikaayen
 Of these Ganas, Blatteria and Mantodia have a very close relationship, placing them both together under Dictyoptera
 exopterigota ke shesh gana, jinke naam hai socoptera, mellophayga, simonculeta, matkunagan or jhallaripaksh, matkunaganik samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 The characteristics of the Mtkunganik community are as follows: special types of mandibulate or sucking mouth, anel lobes not found in the posterior side, lack of sarsai
 malepigian nalikaaon kii sankhya bahut thodi hoti he or pratiprishth tantriktantu kii gucchhikaaye lagbhag ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There are no clear distinctions between the rheumatic and the mitochondrial communities, as the side veins in the Joraptera are somewhat weakened, the number of mallepigian tubules is even smaller, and the neoplasms are also slightly dilated
 socoptera or mellophayga main spasht sambandh prathit hota he, kyonki donon main vilakshan prakaar kaa hypofarics hota he
 Probably Cyphonculata is closely related to Malophaga
 inase ve keval anek bahya or aantarik rachanaaon tathaa prakruti main hi saadrishy nahin rakhte, apitu shwasaradhran kii rachana or andey se bachche nikalne kii vidhi main bhi saadrishy he
 Now the question arises as to why both lice of lice are not considered under the same gana
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki donon ganon ke mukhbhaagon main itnaa adhik antar hota he
 That it is often considered appropriate to keep them separately in different ganas
 indopterigot kiton ke vishay main dhyaan de to kalapaksh, strepciptera or kanchukpaksh ko anya ganon ke saath rakhane main atyadhik kathinata upasthit hoti he, at: inke atirikt shesh sab gana panorapid samudaay ke antargat rakhe gaye hai
 The panorepid community is centralized on the mykaptera with the laminae neuroptera and forms a few distinct microbial branches
 aisa adhik sambhav he ki micoptera ke nimnasth sadasyon se ek ore dwipaksh or duusari ore shalki paksh or lomapaksh kii utpatti hui ho
 The adults of Siphonaptera are very different in composition, but its ovum bipedal subgroups do not differ from some of the Poles of the nematosera, and if the genus Siphonaptera did not originate from the primordial bipedes, it would have at least been from the Panorapid community
 kalapaksh, kanchukpaksh or strepciptera ke vishay main bhi kuch kathinata prathit hoti he
 The subalpine of the acupuncture is conspicuous in the ovum of the symphyta and the ovum of the panorepid insects, as well as the origin of the vein on the sides of the symphyta appears to be from the megalopteran pattern, without difficulty
 in do kaarnon se aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki kalapaksh ke purvaj tathaa jaalpaksh or anya panorapid ganon ke purvaj ek hi the
 There is a view of the Kunchuk side that they originated in a different way from other Indopterigot
 kintu kuch lekhakon kaa aisa anumaan he ki kanchukpaksh kii utpatti jaalpaksheeya akritiwale purvajon se hui
 Strepsiptera are often thought to be related to the ejaculate, but some authors determine their relationship to the appendage
 keet The insect keet The insect keet The insect manovikar kisi vyakti ke maansik swasthya kii vah sthiti he jise kisi swasth vyakti se tulana karne par 'saamaanya' nahin kaha jaataa
 In comparison to healthy individuals, the behavior of persons with psychiatry is determined to be abnormal or misdemeanor and involves significant pain or inability
 inhen manorog, maansik rog, maansik beemaari athwa maansik vikaar bhi kehete hai
 Psychiatrists are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain and psychiatric treatment is required for their treatment
 manovigyaan main hamaare liye asaamaanya or anuchit vyavhaaron ko manovikar kaha jaataa he
 They grow slowly
 manovikaron ke bahut se kaarak hai, jinamein anuvaanshikta, kamjor vyaktitv, sahansheeltaa kaa abhaav, baalyavastha ke anubhav, tanaavpurn paristhitiyaan or inkaa saamana karne kii asamarthy sammilit hai
 The situations that a person finds difficult to solve and cope with are called 'stress factors'
 tanaav kisi vyakti par aisi aavashyaktaaon va maangon ko thope detaa he jise puraa karnaa vah ati dubhar or mushkil samajhataa he
 Persistent failure to meet these demands creates mental tension in the person
 aaj ke samay main tanaav logon ke liye bahut hi saamaanya anubhav ban chukaa he, jo ki adhisankhya daihik or manovaigyanik pratikriyaaon dwaara vyakt hota he
 The traditional definition of stress focuses on the somatic response
 hens style ne 'tanaav' shabd ko khoja or isaki paribhaasha sharir kii kisi bhi aavashyaktaa ke aadhaar par anishchit pratikriya ke rup main kii
 The definition of Hans Shale's base is somatic and gives greater importance to the actions of hormones, which are secreted by the adrenals and other glands
 style ne do prakaar ke tanaavon kii sankalpana kii- The new approach to stress focuses on the role of assessment and interpretation of the situation in relation to the adjustment resources available to the individual
 moolyankan or samaayojan kii anyonyashrith prakriyaayen vyakti ke vaataavaran evam uske anukulan ke bich sambandh nirdhaaran karti he
 Adaptation is the process by which an individual arranges the conditions and environment around him to maintain optimal levels of somatic, psychological and social interest
 tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa saamana karte samay aamtaur par vyakti samasya kendrit yaa manobhaav kendrit kootneetiyon ko apanaataa he
 a problem-focused policy uses a person's intellectual solutions to find solutions to stressful situations and often leads to an effective solution
 manobhaav kendrit niti dwaara tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa saamana karte samay vyakti bhaavnaatmak vyavhaar ko pradarshit karata he jaise chillaanaa
 Although, if a person is unable to cope with stress, then he / she tends to resist-oriented diplomacy, different behaviors can arise if these are adopted repeatedly
 pratirohak-abhivinyast vyavhaar paristhiti kaa saamana karne main samarth nahin banaate, ye keval apni kaarywahiyon ko nyaaysangat dikhaane kaa jariya maatr he
 Physical problems like fever, cough, cold etc
 These are different types of psychosis
 in virgon ke manovikaron kii suchi nunatam vyagrata se lekar gambhir manovikaron jaise manobhaajan yaa khandit maansikta tak he
 Clinical and Statistical Manual on Psychiatry) has been published by the American Psychiatric Association, which mentions a wide variety of mental disorders
 manovigyaan kii jo shakha vikaron kaa samaadhaan khojati he use asaamaanya manovigyaan kaha jaataa he
 You might be surprised to know that children can also become psychotic
 dsam, kaa chauthaa sanskaran baalyavastha ke vibhinn prakaar ke vikaron kaa samaadhaan dhundta he, aamtaur par yah pehali baar shaishavkaal, baalyavastha yaa kishoravastha main pahchaan main aate hai
 Some of these careful-absence hyperactive disorders are found in which the child is not careful or focused or he behaves very agile
 or swalin vikaar jisamen baccha antarmukhi ho jaataa he, bilkul nahin muskuraataa or der se bhashaa sikhta he
 If a person feels scared, scared or anxious without any specific reason, then it can be said that the person is suffering from anxiety disorder
 vyagrata vikaar ke vibhinn prakaar hote hai jisamen chintaa kii bhaavana vibhinn roopon main dikhaai detii he
 Some of these disorders are caused by extreme and unconditional fear of something and obsessive-compulsive disorder where a person keeps thinking the same thing again and again and repeating their actions
 ve vyakti jo manodasha vikaar ke anubhavon se grasit hote hai unke manobhaav dirghakaal tak pratibandhit ho jate hai, ve vyakti kisi ek manobhaav par sthir ho jate hai, yaa in bhaavon kii shreniyon main adal-badal karte rahete hai
 For example, whether a person remains depressed for a few days or remains depressed on one day and remains happy the next day, his behavior has nothing to do with the situation
 is tarah vyakti ke vyavhaarik lakshanon par ashrith manodasha vikaar do prakaar ke hote hai - Depression is a mental state that is characterized by sadness, lack of interest and lack of pleasure in daily activities, restless sleep and loss of sleep, less hunger, no weight loss, or more hunger and weight gain, laziness, feeling guilty , Shows disqualification, helplessness, despair, Shani in establishing concentration and signs of negative ideology towards herself and others
 yadi kisi vyakti ko is tarah ke bhav nunatam do saptaah tak rahen to use avsaadagrast kaha ja saktaa he or us ke upachaar ke liye use sheeghra naidanik chikitsa pradaan karwaanaa aavashyak he
 In today's time, some diseases have become very common such as low blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes etc
 vaise to ye sab shaareerik bimaariyaan hai parantu ye manavaigyanik kaarnon jaise tanaav va chintaa se utpann hoti hai
 So psychosomatic disorders are psychological problems that exhibit physical symptoms, but are psychological due to this
 vahiin manodaihik kii avadharana main man kaa arth maanas he or daihik kaa arth sharir he
 Conversely, somatic disorders are disorders whose symptoms are physical but their biological causes are not revealed
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi koi vyakti petdard kii shikaayat kar rahaa he parantu tab bhi jab uske us khaas ang arthath pet main kisi tarah kii koi samasya nahin hoti
 After a traumatic event, a person is unable to recognize his / her past existence, past events and the people around them
 naidanik manovigyaan main is tarah kii samasyaon ko vighatnsheel vikaar kaha jaataa he, jisamen kisi vyakti kaa vyaktitv samajadhut va samaaj se pruthak ho jaataa he
 Disruptive amnesia is a class of disruptive psychosis in which a person is usually unable to recall important personal information after a stressful event
 vighatan kii sthiti main vyakti apane naye astitv ko mahasoos karata he
 The second category is disruptive identity disorder in which a person loses his memory, while he starts imagining a new existence
 anya varg vyaktitwalope vikaar he, jisamen vyakti achaanak badlaav yaa bhinn prakaar se vicitra mahasoos karata he
 a person feels as if he has abandoned his body or his movements suddenly become mechanical or dreamlike
 haalanki vighatan manovikar kii sab se gambheer sthiti tab utpann ho ti he jab koi ekaadhik vyaktitv manovikar va vighatan astitv manovikar se grast ho
 In this situation diverse personalities appear at different times in the same person
 aapane sadak par kabhi kisi vyakti ko gande kapadon main, kooday ke aasapaas pade asvachh bhojan ko khate yaa phir ajeeb tareeke se baatcheet yaa vyavhaar karte hue dekha hoga
 They have a weak orientation in terms of person, place and time
 ham aksar unhen pagal, besudha aadi kah dete hai, parantu naidanik bhashaa main inhen manovidhlit kehete hai
 This is a serious state of psychosis, which results from disturbed thoughts, feelings and behavior
 manovidalan vikaron main asangat maansikta, doshapurn abhigna, sanchaalak kaaryakalapon main baadha, neeras va anupyukt bhav hote hai
 People suffering from this are obsessed with reality and often get lost in the world of fantasy and misconception
 vibhranti kaa arth kisi aisi cheez ko dekhnaa he jo vastav main bhautik rup se vahaan nahin hoti, kuch aisi awaajen jo vahaan par vastav main nahin hai
 Illusionism is blind faith in reality
 Such beliefs dissuade others
 manovidalan ke vibhinn prakaar hai jaise catatonic manovidalan
 The personality disorder has its roots in a person's infancy, where some children develop a maladaptive and impolite ideology
 ye vibhinn vyaktitv manovikar vyakti main hanirahit algaav se le kar bhaavanahin kramik hatyare ke rup main saamne aate hai
 The categories of personality psychosis can be classified into three groups
 pehle, samooh kii visheshta ajeeb or sanakee vyavhaar he
 Anxiety and doubt are characteristic of the second group and the third group is characterized by dramatic, emotional and erratic behavior
 pehle samooh main vyamohabh, intarvabandha, pagal vyaktitv vikaar sammilit hai
 The second group is characterized by dependent, altered, obsessive personality psychosis
 asaamaajik, simavarti, abhinay, atmmohi vyaktitv vikaar tisare samooh ke antargat aate hai
 To deal with any type of psychosis, the person is served by some specialized psychotherapeutic procedure
 vah vyakti jo manashchikitsa ke craryakram kaa praaroop tay karata he vah prashikshit vyakti hota he, jise naidanik manovaigyanik yaa manochikitsak kehete hai
 The person who gets this treatment is called a servant / patient
 manashchikitsa ko aksar vaarta upachaar kaha jaataa he kyon ki ye antarvaiyaktik sampark dwaara pradaan kii jaati he
 Its drugs can only be given by a psychiatrist, who is a medicinal doctor
 There are various techniques of psychiatry, which describe the cause and development of abnormal behaviors
 inamen manovishleshan, vyavhaar chikitsa, sangyanatmak-vyavhaar chikitsa, sevaarthee kendrit chikitsa ityadi sammilit hai
 Psychiatry is a designed scheme that is designed keeping in mind the nature and severity of psychosis
 vyakti tanaav se nipatane ke liye aamtaur par kaary-abhivinyast or pratiraksha-abhivinyast yaa manobhaav kendrit prakriyaaon kaa paalan karata he
 The purpose of the work oriented process is to find a realistic solution to the adjusting demand imposed by a particular stress factor
 ye chetan or tarksangat str par tanaavpurn sthitiyon ke vastunishth moolyankan par aadhaarit hoti hai
 These methods of dealing with stress are divided into three categories such as initiation, withdrawal and compromise
 manobhaav kendrit yaa aatmaraksha-abhivinyast tareekon se tanaav kaa saamana karnaa laabhakaari siddh nahin hota, kyonki vyakti iske dwaara kisi samaadhaan par nahin pahunchataa, bas swayan ko aashwaasan dene ke tareeke dhundta he
 An example of self-preservation methods is intelligent interpretation such as arguing that all students failed because exam papers were difficult
 iskaa anya udhaaharan he visthaapan karnaa jaise sakht adhyaaapak par aa rahe krodh ko apane chote bhai ko daant yaa maar kar utaarna
 Here you have displaced anger
 yah samajhnaa bahut mahatvapurn he ki tanaav se prabhaavshaalee tareeke se nipatane ke liye vyakti ko swasth jeevanstyli ko apnaanaa chahie
 Stress cannot be better dealt with only by positive thinking, emotions and actions, but by this we feel very happy and light in life, and become more worthy
 maansik vikaar bahut tarah ke hote hai
 These disorders can be related to personality, mood, eating habits, anxiety etc
 is prakaar maansik rogon kii suchi bahut badi he
 a list of some main psychiatrists is given below- manorogon ke kaaran kai prakaar ke hote hai
 The following are the main types of these: anuvanshik :manoveekshipti yaa psychosis, vyaktitv rog, madirapan, mandabuddhi, mirgee ityadi rog un logon main adhik paye jate hai, jinke parivaar kaa koi sadsy inase peedit hon to santan ko inkaa khatra lagbhag doguna ho jaataa he
 Affective diseases, hysteria, heart disease, etc
 are more prevalent in macro individuals, whereas fragmented psychosis, stress, personality diseases are more common in people with long and lean formation
 apane main khoye hue, chup rahane vaale, kam mitra rakhane vaale kitaabi-keede jaise gun vaale, skijid vyaktitv vaale logon main schijophreniya adhik hota he, jabaki anushaasit tathaa safai pasand, samaynishth, mitavyayi jaise gunon vaale khapati vyaktitv ke logon main khapat rog adhik paaya jaataa he
 Physical changes such as adolescence, puberty, old age, pregnancy can form the basis of many psychiatric conditions
 kuch dawaaon, rasinic tatwon, dhaatuon, madiraa tathaa anya maadak padaarthon ityadi kaa seven manorogon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ban saktaa hai
 Stress in mutual relations, death of a loved one, loss of respect, loss of work, financial loss, marriage, divorce, childbirth, retirement, examination or failure in love, etc
 also contribute to creating or enhancing psychopaths
 Huh
 saamaajik evam manoranjak gatividhiyon se duraav, akelaapan, raajnneetik, prakritik yaa saamaajik durghatnaayen manorog utpann kar sakate hai
 Mental illness or insanity is a term with which many misconceptions and apprehensions are attached about its causes and treatment
 kuch log ise ek asaadhya, anuvaanshik evam chhot kii beemaari maanate hai, to kuch jaadu-tona, bhoot-pret va dian kaa prakope
 Some even consider it as a drama to avoid responsibilities rather than disease
 agyani log upachaar ke liye sthaneey yaa najadik ojha, pandit, mullah aadi ke paas jaakar anaavashyak bhabhoot, jadi-booti kaa seven karte hai tathaa amanviya bhang se sataaye jate hai taaki 'pishachatma' kaa prakope dur kiya ja sake
 All of this is wrong
 sahi dharna yah he ki yah beemaari he or vaigyanik dhang se chikitsa vigyaan dwaara iskaa ilaaj sambhav he
 It is also not right that- raj or tam ye do maanas rog hai 
 Disorders caused by their deformity are called Manas diseases
 kaam, krodh, lobh, moh, ishyar, maan, mad, shok, chintaa, udvaig, bhay, hashar, vishaad, abhyasooya, dainya, matsair or dambh ye maanas rog hai
