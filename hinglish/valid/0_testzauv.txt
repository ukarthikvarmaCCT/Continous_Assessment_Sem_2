 The first voice that comes to our memory as soon as the mention of Braj culture is the sound of the waves of the Yamuna hitting the ghats

 Hearing his waves stop

 surdaas or mira ke padon par naachi hai
 Yamuna gave birth to the culture of Braj


 Along with the culture of Braj, the trend of the word 'braj' reached its peak during the Bhakti movement
 chaudaavin-pandrahavin shatabdi kii krishna bhakthi kii vyapak lahar ne braj shabd kii pavitrataa ko jan-jan main purna rup se prachaarit kar diya
 The hymns of Sur, Meera and Rasakhan continue to resonate in the atmosphere of Braj even today

 In datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work, John johnson-illola describes a typical computer-supported collaboration space: The Smart Board
 johnson-ilola ke anusaar, ek "smart board pranali ek 72-inch, pichhlaa prakshepan, tachascreen, kaary hetu kushal whitboard sataha pradaan karti he" 
 In datacloud, johnson-ilola emphasizes that "we are trying to understand how users move within the information space, how users can stay within the information space rather than just looking at them, and How information places should be shared with other people instead of being confined to themselves, who used to reside in it instead of just visiting
 vah vyakhya karte hai ki kaise smart board pranali ek soochna sthaan pradaan karti he jo apane chaatro ko sakriy sahyog main sanlagn hone kii anumati pradaan karata he
 He makes three different claims about the functionality of this technology: 1) this smart board system allows users to work with much information, 2) it provides an information space that proactively supports Invites, 3) Generated tasks are often "dynamic and emergent"
 johnson-ilola further states that with smart boards "


 information work becomes a physical experience Is "

 Bernard Laskin, the pioneer of e-education, argues that if e-education is to be effective, then the word "E" must have a greater understanding of the wider meaning
 laskin kehete hai ki "i" kii vyakhya / anuwaad is tarah se kii jaani chahie ki iskaa arth ek paramparaagat rashtriya vyakhya / anuwaad ke rup main "electronic" ke atirikt romaanchak, urjavan, utsaahi, bhavuk, vistrut, utkrisht, evam shaikshik nikle

 In this war, on one side was the army of British East India Company and on the other side was the army of the Nawab of Bengal
 company kii sena ne robert clive ke netritv main nawab sirazuddaula ko haraa diya tha
 But this war cannot be considered as a victory of the company because before the war, Kalaiv had conspired with three generals of the Nawab, his courtier, and Amir Seth Jagat Seth, etc
 of the state
 nawab kii to puri sena ne yuddh me bhaag bhi nahi liya tha yuddh ke foran baad mir jaafar ke putr miran ne nawab kii hatya kar di thi
 War is considered very unfortunate for India, it is from this war that the story of India's slavery begins

 Using the resources obtained from this war, the company decisively defeated the French company in the Third and Final War of Karnataka
 is yuddh ke baad bedara ke yuddh me company ne dch company ko haraaya tha
 Information about this war is available in the India House Library of London which is a very large library and there are 20 thousand documents of the time of India's slavery
 vahaan uplabdh dastavej ke hisaab se angrejon ke paas plasi ke yuddh ke samay maatr 300 sipaahi the or sirajudaula ke paas 18 hajaar sipaahi
 The commander of the British army was Robert Clive and the commander of Siraj-daulah was Mirzafar
 robert clive ye jaanata tha kii aamane saamne kaa yuddh hua to ek ghanta bhi nahin lagegaa or ham yuddh haar jaayenge or clive ne kai baar chitthee likh ke british parliament ko ye bataaya bhi tha
 Clive also has two letters in these documents
 jisame usne ye prarthana kii he ki agar plasi kaa yuddh jeetna he to mujhe or sipaahi die jaaen
 In response to this, a letter was sent from the British Parliament that we are currently fighting a war against Napoleon Bonaparte and this war is more important to us than Plassey and we cannot give you more soldiers than this
 robert clive ne tab apane do jasoos lagaaye or unase kaha kii ja ke pataa lagaao kii sirajudaula ke fuj main koi aisa aadmi he jise ham rishwat de laalach de or rishwat ke laalach main apane desh se gaddari kar sake
 His detectives found out that there is a man in his army who can sell Bengal in the name of bribe and if you give him the lure of a chair, he can sell seven books of Bengal too
 or wo aadmi tha mirajafar or mirajafar aisa aadmi tha jo din raat ek hi sapana dekhtaa tha kii wo kab bengal kaa nawab banegaa
 When Robert Clive learned these things, he wrote a letter to Mirzafar
 company ne iske baad kathputli nawab mir jafar ko satta de di kintu ye baat kisi ko pataa na thi ke satta company ke paas he
 Till the Nawab's court, he was called the donkey of Clive, the company officials had fiercely bribed the business of Bengal completely destroyed, apart from this there was utter chaos in Bengal
 plasi yuddh ke kaaran or parinaam' The Plassey War has a great importance in the history of modern India
 is yuddh ke dwaara east india company ne bengal ke nawab siraajudadaula ko parajeet kar bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali
 Therefore, this war has a special place in the decisive wars of India
 bengal mughal samrajya kaa ek abhinn ang tha
 But after Aurangzeb's death, under it, he declared his independence in various provinces
 jisamen alvardi khan ne bengal par apana adhikaar kar liya
 He had no son
 sirf teen putriyaan thi
 The elder girl was a sixed Begum childless
 duusari or teesri se ek- ek putr the
 Which was named Shaukatganj, and Siraj-ud-daula
 ve sirajuddaula ko adhik pyaar karte the
 Therefore, during his life time he had declared his successor
 10 april 1756 ko alvardi kii mrityu hui
 And Siraj-ud-daula became the Nawab of Bengal but from the very beginning his struggle with the East India Company became inevitable
 ant main 23 june 1757 ko donon ke bich yuddh chhidaa jise plasi yuddh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 There were many reasons for this war which are as follows
 aantarik sangharsh- Siraj-ud-daula faced the struggle of Shaukatganj as soon as he sat on the throne as Shaukatganj wanted to become the Nawab
 isamen chhasiti begum tathaa uske divaan rajwallaav or mughal samraat kaa samarthan use praapt tha is liye sirajuddaula ne sabase pehle us aantarik sangharsh ko sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Because of this, the interference of British in Bengal politics was increasing, the Nawab killed Shaukatganj
 or iske pashchaat usne angrejon se muqabla karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Conspiracy against the Nawab by the British prarambh se hi angrejon kii aakhen bengal par lagi hui thi
 Because Bengal was a fertile and rich province
 agar bengal par company kaa adhikaar ho jaataa to use adhik se adhik dhan kamaane kii aashaa thi
 Not only this, they joined the Hindu traders and started provoking them against the Nawab
 The Nawab did not like it
 vyapaarik suvidhaon kaa upyog- The British were allowed to do free maritime trade by the Mughal emperor but the British started misusing it
 ve apana vyaktigat vyapaar bhi ni:shulk karne lage or deshi vyapaariyon ko bina chungi die vyapaar karne ke liye protsaahit karne lage
 This caused economic damage to the Nawab
 nawab inhen pasand nahin karata tha jab, unhone vyapaarik suvidhaon ke durupyog ko band karne kaa nishchay kiya to angrej sangharsh par utar aae
 Forts were closed by the British is samay europe main saptavarshiya yuddh chhidane kii ashanka thi
 In which England and France were to fight against each other, so also in other country which were British and French
 unhe yuddh kii ashanka thi
 So to strengthen his position, he started fortifications
 nawab ise bardaast nahin kar saktaa tha
 The British did not recognize Siraj-ud-daula as Nawab
 bengal kii pracheen parampara ke anusaar agar koi nayaa nawab gaddi par baithta tha to us din darvaar lagati thi
 And the representatives of the kings, rich or foreign castes residing under him had to present and present gifts in the court
 ki ve naye nawab ko sweekaar karte hai
 But on the occasion of the coronation of Siraj-ud-daula, no British representative appeared in the court
 kyonki ve sirajuddaula ko nawab nahin maanate the iske chalate bhi donon ke bich sangharsh kii sanmbhaavna badhati gai
 Trying to change the Nawab angrej sirajuddaula ko hataa kar kisi aise vyakti ko nawab bananaa chaahate the jo uske ishaare par chalane ke liye taiyaar ho iske liye angrejon ne prayaas karnaa shuru kiya
 In such a situation, the struggle could not be avoided
 kalakatta par akraman- When the Nawab issued an order to stop the captivity of the fort, the British paid no heed to him and he continued to build the fort
 isapar nawab krodhit ho uthaa or 4 june 1756 ko kasimbazar kii kothi par akraman kar diya
 The British soldiers were frightened by this attack and the British were defeated and the Nawab took over the Qasim Bazar
 iske baad nawab ne shighr hi kalakatta ke fort wilia par akraman kiya yahan angrej sainik bhi nawab ke samaksh tik nahin paaya or isapar bhi nawab kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 In this war, many British soldiers were arrested
 kaali kothri kii durghatana- In the above battle, the Nawab imprisoned 146 British soldiers, then locked him in a small dark cell, its length was 18 feet and width was 14-10 feet
 yah angrejon ke dwaara banaaya gaya tha or isamen bhartiya aparaadhiyon ko band kiya jaataa tha
 Since it was a hot summer day and the culmination of the war, 123 soldiers died due to suffocation and 23 soldiers survived, including Yeswell, an English soldier
 usee ke is ghatana kii jaankaree madras ke angrejon ko di
 This accident is known as the black closet accident
 iske chalate angrejon kaa krodh bhadak uthaa or ve nawab se yuddh kii taiyaari karne lage
 The British re-occupied Calcutta
 apni paraajay kaa badla lene ke liye angrej ne sheeghra hi kalakatta par akraman kar diya
 At this time the Nawab appointed Manikchand as the king of Calcutta
 lekin vah angrejon kaa mitra or shubhachintak tha
 As a result, the British conquered Calcutta was freed from the clutches of the Nawab
 9 farvari 1757 ko donon ke bich ali nagar kii sandhi hui or angrejon ko phir se sabhi tarah ke vyavhaarik adhikaar uplabdh ho gaya
 British invasion of French angrejon ne francisiyon kii vasti chand nagar par akraman kar diya
 And took him under control
 francisi nawab ke mitra the isliye nawab is ghatana se kaaphi kshubdh the
 Secret treaty with Mirzafar - isi samay angrejon ne nawab ko padchyut karne ke liye ek shadyantra rachaa
 Many people of the Nawab were also involved in this
 jaise- raidurlabh pradhan senapati mirajafar or dhani vyapakir jagat sevak aadi
 The British made a temptation to make Mirzafar the Nawab of Bengal and after this treaty of secret treaty with him, the Nawab was accused that he had violated the treaty of Ali Nagar and by making the same excuse, the British attacked the Nawab on 22 June 1757
 Attacked
 plasi yuddh ke maidan main ghamaasan yuddh prarambh hua mirajafar to pehle hi angrejon se sandhi kar chukaa tha falat: nawab kii jabardast paraajay hui
 The British won
 nawab kii hatya kar di gai or mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banaaya gaya
 Results of the Battle of Plassey plasi yuddh ke dwaara bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 The British were made Nawabs
 plasi kaa yuddh vastav main koi yuddh nahin tha yah ek shadyantra or vishwasghaati kaa pradarshan tha prasiddh itihaaskaar ‘panivkar’ ke anusaar plasi kaa yuddh nahin, parantu iskaa parinaam kaaphi mahatvapurn niklaa
 Therefore, it has a place in the decisive wars of the world
 kyonki isi ke dwaara bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 Clive has called this war a revolution
 vastav main yah ek kranti thi kyonki iske dwaara bhartiya itihaas kii dhara main mahaan parivartan aa gaya or ek vyapaarik sanstha ne bengal kii rajanithik bagdor apane haathon main le lee
 Different types of results are visible
 raajnneetik parinaam- Its political consequences proved fatal for India
 iske dwaara ek vyapaarik sanstha ke haathon main raajnneetik adhikaron kaa samavesh hua or bharat main angreji satta kaayam hua
 In fact, it was of great importance to the British nation, after this war Mirzafar was made the Nawab of Bengal
 parantu yah k ayogy vyakti tha
 Taking the disqualification of its inefficiency, the actual ruler of Bengal became the British
 bengal par angrejon kaa prabhaav badhata gaya or dhire- 2 british samrajya ke vistaar kaa maarg saaf hota gaya
 With the withdrawal of siraj-ud-daula, the British had the advantage of increasing political dominance
 mughal samrajya ke liye bi plasi kaa parinaam ghaatak siddh hua bengal se prativarsh mughal shaasha ko acchhee aamadani hoti thi lekin ab yah aamadani samaapt ho gai
 The British came to know about the weakness of the Indian King
 bhavishya main usne uskaa kaaphi phayda uthaaya or uttari bharat kii vijay kaa maarg prashast hua
 Economic consequences is yuddh ke dwaara angrejon ko kaaphi aarthik laabh pahunchaa mirajafar ne company ko 1 karod 17 lakh rupee diye jisase company kii aarthik sthiti kaaphi majboot ho gai bengal kii lut se bi use kaaphi dhan haath laga
 The monastery employees of the company got Rs 12 and a half lakh
 clive ko do lakh 24 hajaar rupye mili
 After this war, the company gradually became the 2nd Diwan of Bengal
 is prakaar iske dwaara bharat main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 The British got the right to trade again
 Mirzafar provided 3 crore rupees to the company as an encroachment and the business also made a profit of 15 crores
 By- Mohammad Shahid a new political power emerged from this incident
 company ke hit raajnneeti se jud gaye or vah prabhutv prapti me jute gayi
 The weakness of the Mughal Empire was also cleared
 company ko bharat ke shaasha varg kii charitra, foot kaa pataa lag gaya
 The Sinhalese language is the largest language spoken in Sri Lanka
 sinhalai ke baad srilanka main sabase zyada boli janevaali bhashaa tamil he
 It is usually not the case that the name of a country should be of the caste settled in that country and the same name should also be of the language used by that caste
 sinhal dweep kii yah visheshta he ki usamen basane vaali jati bhi "sinhal" kehalaati chali ai he or us jati dwaara vyavahrut hone vaali bhashaa bhi "sinhal"
 Like the scripts of many Indian languages, the Sinhala language script is also a modified version of the Brahmi script and as Devanagari is the alphabet of all Indian languages, in addition to the Urdu alphabet, Devanagari is also the alphabet of the Sinhala language
 sinhal bhashaa ko do rup maanya hai - shuddh sinhal tathaa mishrit sinhal Only thirty-two letters are valid for Shudh Sinhala- sinhal ke pracheenatam vyakaran granth sidatsangra ) kaa mat he ki ji tathaa i -- a, tathaa aa kii hi maatra vruddhi vaali matraayen hai
 The present mixed Sinhala has not only enriched its alphabet with the letters of the Pali alphabet, but has also adopted all those which were more in the Sanskrit alphabet
 is prakaar vartmaan mishrit sinhal main aksharon kii sankhya chauvan he
 Eighteen letters are considered "swara" and the remaining thirty-six letters are consonants
 do akshar jab milakar ekarup hote hai, to yah prakriya "sandhi" kehalaati he
 Only ten types of treaties are considered in pure Sinhala
 kintu aadhunik sinhal main sanskrit shabdon kii sandhi athwa sandhichchhed sanskrit vyakaranon ke niyamon ke hi anusaar kiya jaataa he
 The group terms of "monosyllabic" or "anaxaksharas", like Sanskrit, are divided into four parts - Namay, Eminent, Prefix and Nipat
 sinhal main hindi kii hi tarah do vachan hote hai - "ekvachan" tathaa "bahuvachan"
 There is no additional "dualism" like Sanskrit
 is "ekvachan" tathaa "bahuvachan" ke bhed ko sankhya bhed kehete hai
 Just as "hindi" and "sinhala" are equated with "vow", similarly we can say that Hindi and pure Sinhala are also synonymous with "gender"
 purush teen hi hai - pratham purush, madhyam purush tathaa uttam purush
 There are eight factors of pronouns used in all three men, which have their own distinctions
 "karm" ke baad praaia: "karan" kaarak kii ginati hoti he, kintu sinhal ke aath karkon main "karm" tathaa "karan" ke bich main "kartri" kaarak kii ginati kii jaati he
 The number of factors remains at eight, despite the "dominant" factor not being the "address" factor
 vaakya kaa mukhyansh "kriya" ko hi maanate hai, kyonki kriya ke abhaav main koi bhi kathan banataa hi nahin he
 Thus Sinhala grammar is mostly a copy of Sanskrit
 to bhi usamen na to sanskrit kii tarah "parasmapad" tathaa "aatmanepad" hote hai or na lat lot aadi das lakaar
 These eight types of verbs are considered in Sinhala - sinhal bhashaa bolne-chaalane ke samay hamaari bhojpuri aadi boliyon kii tarah pratyayon kii drushti se bahut hi aasaan he, kintu likhane-padhane main utani hi duruh
 In speech and speech, i go through the verb only, xxwrep 5 go, etc
 i will not go, go, go etc
 becomes the work of all verbs
 lingabhed hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye tedi kheer mana jaataa he
 Sinhala language is very simple from this point of view
 vahaan "acha" shabd ke samanaarthi "hond" shabd kaa prayog aap "ladkaa" tathaa "ladki" donon ke liye kar sakate hai
 The idioms of each language are its own
 duusari bhashaaon main unke thik-thik paryaay khojna bekaar he
 Nevertheless, due to experience equivalence, similar sayings are available in two different languages spoken by two different castes
 sinhal tathaa hindi ke kuch muhaavaron tathaa kahawaton main paryaapt ekarupata he
 The Sinhala language, which is similar to more than one language of North India, has developed from the language of those inscriptions which BC
 Available continuously since the second third century
 bhagwaan buddha ke parinirvana ke do sau varsh baad ashokaputra mahendra sinhal dweep pahunche, to "mahavansh" ke anusaar unhone sinhal dweep ke logon ko dweep bhashaa main hi upadesh diya tha
 The tradition that Mahamati Mahendra brought with him was "oral"
 vah parampara yaa to buddha ke samay kii "magadhi" rahi hogi, yaa unke do sau varsh baad kii koi aisi "praakrit" jise mahendra sthavir swayan bolte rahe honge
 Sinhala history holds that Mahendra Sthavir brought with him not only the tradition of Tripitaka, but also the traditions of his languages or his stories
 un atthakathaon kaa baad main sinhal anuwaad hua

 The gotra of Kadamba clan was Manavya and the people of the said dynasty believed their origin from Hariti

 The capital of this state was Vaijayanti or Banavasi

 Kang Vermann, son of Mayur Sharmana, successfully confronted the invasion of Vakataka king Vindhyashakti II, even though some area of his kingdom went to the right of Vakatakas
 is kul kaa anya shaktishaalee raja kakustha varman tha jisane is vansh ke yash tathaa rajyasima main paryaapt vistaar kiya
 In the early decades of the sixth century Ravi Varman became the king, who removed his capital from Banavasi to form Palashika or Halsey

 The rise of the Chalukyas of Vatapi had a very bad effect on the Kadamba kingdom
 chalukyaraj pulakeshin pratham ne kadambon se uttari praant chin liye or pulakeshin dwitiya ne unako sarvatha shaktiheen kar daalaa
 On the other hand, the king of Gangaraja, situated to the south of the Kadamba kingdom, also saw the opportunity to avenge the old war, invaded and annexed the southern provinces of the Kadambas

 By the end of the 13th century, many small branches of the Kadambas continued to rule in the Deccan and Konkan

 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"

 His first song is a poetry collection
 is sangrah main 1924 se 1928 tak ke rachit geet sangrahit hai
 Mahadevi Verma's own statement regarding the content of the neehar is remarkable - "in the time of the creation of the nehra my sensations were filled with the same kind of mixed anguish, like the inexplicable golden usha that appears in the mind of the child and away from the touch of the cloud
 Arises from the first vision of " in geeton main kautuhal mishrit vednaa kii swaabhaavik abhivyakti hui he
 Rashmi is the second collection of poetry by Mahadevi Varma

 i have songs composed from 1934 to 1936 AD
 in geeton man neeraja ke bhaavon kaa paripakv rup miltaa he
 Here, there is a coordination not only of happiness and sorrow but also of tears and anguish, union and disunity, hope and despair and liberation
 deepashikha main 1936 se 1942 i0 tak ke geet hai
 The main rendition of the songs in this collection is to erase the self and make others happy
 yah mahadevi kii siddhavastha kaa kavy he, jisamen sadhika kii aatma kii deepashikha akampit or achanchal hokar aradhy kii akhand jyoti main villin ho gai he
 i have composed compositions composed in the last days of Mahadevi that will overwhelm and surprise the readers, in the sense that the tone of compassion and compassion in Mahadevi poetry, which has become their identity since then
 'agnirekha` main deepak ko pratik maanakar anek rachanaayen likhi gayi hai
 There are poems on many subjects as well
 deepashikha main mahadevi verma ke geeton kaa adhikarik vishay ‘prem’ he
 But they have found the significance of love more than the jubilant moments of union, in the agony of violence
 saptaparna main mahadevi ne apni saanskrithik chetana ke sahare veda, ramayana, ther gaatha, ashwaghosh, kalidas, bhawabhooti evam jayadev kii kritiyon se tadatmya sthapit karke 39 chaynit mahatvapurn anshon kaa hindi kavyanuwaad is prastut kiya he
 Initially in the 61-page 'apni Baat', he has also presented a deeply researched discussion about this invaluable heritage of Indian Manisha and literature
 ’saptaparna’ ke antargat arshvani, valmiki, thergatha, ashwaghosh, kalidas or bhawabhooti ke baad saatven sopan par mahadevi verma ne jayadev ko pratishthit kiya he
 He has told that Radhakrishna had acquired a reputation as the hero-heroine of Sringa poetry of Sanskrit when Jayadeva emerged
 


mahadevi ji ne ’saptaparna’ main sanskrit or pali sahitya ke chaynit anshon kaa kavyanuwaad prastut karte samay apni drushti bhartiya chintanadhara or saundaryabodh kii parampara ke itihaas par kendrit rakhi he
 This work of his is fully capable of establishing him as a successful creative poet, historian and culture thinker, no doubt
 nihar jivan ke ushakal kii hi rachana he, jisamen satya kuhajaal main chipa rah kar bhi mohak or kutuhalapurna prathit hoti he
 'rashmi' is the creation of the early days of puberty
 jab satya kii kirane aatma main gyaan kii jwaala jagaa detii hai
 'neerja' is a work of adult mental state of the poetess, in which she scatters her Saurabh in her bright path in the bright light of day like Kamalini
 'sandhyagit' main jivan ke sandhyakaal kii karunardrata or vairaygy bhaavana ke saath-saath aatma kii apane aadhyatmik ghar ko laut chalane kii pravriti vartmaan he
 In 'deepshikha', the spirit of Jeevan Deep burning in front of Aaradhya in the calm, snug and zero atmosphere of the night is prominent
 is prakaar unhone apane jivan ke ahoratr ko in paanch pratikatmak sheershakon main vibhakt kar apni jivan sadhana kaa marm spasht kar diya he
 As a result of this solitary practice of anguish, the diversity of subjects in Mahadevi's poetry is very low
 unki kuch hi kavitaayen aisi hai, jinamein rashtriya or saanskrithik udbodhan athwa prakruti kaa swatantra chithran hua he
 Due to the theme and approach being the same in all the remaining poems, his poetry ground could not be expanded
 isse unke kavy ko haani or laabh donon hua he
 The disadvantage is that due to non-change of subject, there is a lot of monotony and mood in all his poetry
 laabh yah hua he ki simit kshetra ke bheetar hi kavyitri ne anubhutiyon ke anekanek ayaamon ko anek drushtikonon se dekh-parakhkar unke sookshmatisookshm bhed-prabhedon ko bimbarup main saamne rakhte hue chitrit kiya he
 In this way, his poetry may not have the expansive vastness and philosophical gravity, but the seriousness and importance of his feelings, the subtlety of the senses, the clarity of the images and the lack of imagination, are sure
 is tarah unke kavy vistaar kaa nahin gaharaai kaa kavy he
 The poems of Mahadevi are not descriptive and chronological
 aantarik sookshm anubhutiyon kii abhivyakti unhone sahaj bhavochhavas ke rup main kii he
 For this reason there is a multiplicity of semiotics and expressiveness in his expression system
 rupakaatmak bimbon or pratikon ke sahare unhone jo mohak chitra upasthit kiye hai, ve unki sookshm drushti or rangamayi kalpana kii shaktimatta kaa parichay dete hai
 He has taken these pictures from his perspective, especially the natural environment, but he took nature very little as a stand
 prakruti unke kavy main sadaiv uddipan, alankaar, pratik or sanket ke rup main hi chitrit hui hai
 For this reason, he has made the most familiar and all-seeing scenes or objects of nature a gift of his poetry
 uske asaadhaaran or alpaparichit drishyon kii ore unka dhyaan nahin gaya he
 Nevertheless, the full or partial images he has depicted by limited natural products give a complete introduction to his pictorial imagination
 isi kalpana ke darshan unke un chitron main bhi hote hai, jo unhone shabdon se nahin, rangon or tulika ke madhyam se nirmit kiye hai
 His paintings have been published with poems in 'deepshikha' and 'yama'
 mahadevi verma ne likhaa he- 'kala ke paras kaa sparsh paa lene vaale kaa kalakaar ke atirikt koi naam nahin, sadhak ke atirikt koi varg nahin, satya ke atirikt koi poonji nahin, bhav-saundarya ke atirikt koi vyapaar nahin or kalyaan ke atirikt koi laabh nahin
 'during the writing period, he remained unanimous and made meaningful things written in the spiritual creation of uninterrupted pace and the practice of a life of karma
 ek mahadevi hi hai jinhone gadhy main bhi kavita ke marm kii anubhuti karai or 'gadhyan kavinaa nikshan vadanti' ukti ko charitaarth kiya he
 The unique thing is that neither he wrote the novel, nor the story, nor the drama is still the best prose
 unke granth lekhan main ek ore rekhachitr, sansmaran yaa phir yatravrit hai to duusari ore sampadakeey, bhoomikaaye, niabandh or abhibhaashan, par sabamein jaise sampurna jivan kaa vaividhya samaaya he
 Without the help of imaginative poetic forms, a creator can earn so much in prose, it can be known only by reading Mahadevi
 hindi sahitya main chandrakantha mani ke samaan dravanshil karun ras kii devi mahadevi verma na keval vishisht kalakaar, kavyitri or gadhy lekhika hai apitu isse aage ek shreshth nibandhkaar bhi hai
 His prose, like poetry, does not take us away from life by forgetting it in beauty, it gives us inspiration to peek into real life by filling our veins with consciousness

 tarkdwar yaa logic get vah yukti he jiskaa output uske input par upasthit vartmaan sanketon yaa purv sanketon kaa koi logical falan ho
 It can be a physical device or an idealized device
 aajkal adhiktar ardhchaalak logic get prayog kiye jate hai kintu siddhantatah ye vidyutchumbakeey riley, taral logic, daab logic, prakaashik logic, anuon aadi se bhi banaaye ja sakate hai
 Algorithms that can be described by boolean logic can also be given to form those algorithms from these physical gates
 jis prakaar ek darwaja do avasthaaon - 'khulaa yaa band' main ho saktaa he, usee tarah logic get kaa output bhi 'hai yaa lo' ho saktaa he
 Logic can be as simple as gate, end and or, and as complex as a computer
 diod kaa upyog karke banaaya gaya logic get sabase saral logic get he
 However, only AND and OR gates can be made, 'inverter' cannot be made
 atah ise ek 'apurna logic parivaar' kah sakate hai
 Some type of amplifier will be needed to be able to build all logic gates including inver
 isaliye 'sampoorn logic parivaar' banane ke liye riley, nirvaat nalika yaa transistor kaa prayog aprihaary he
 The logic family built using bipolar transistors is called resistor-transistor logic
 aarmabhik ekikrut paripathon main isi kaa upyog kiya gaya tha
 Then came diode-transistor logic and transistor-transistor logic, correcting from various angles
 ab lagbhag sab jagah transistor kaa sthaan mossphate ne le liya he jisase isi kam sthaan gherti he or kaam karne ke liye kam urja kshay hoti he
 The currently used logic family name is Complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor
 teen avasthaa vaale logic get ke output kii teen alag-alag avasthaaen hoti hai
 These are high, low and high impedance
 logic kii drushti se hai impidence avasthaa kii koi bhoomika nahin he 
 But due to its high impedance state, these devices are used to send data from various devices on the data bus
 jo yukti bas ko data bhej rahi hoti he, usko chhodkar us bas se judi anya sabhi yuktiyon ko 'hai impidence state' main kar diya jaataa he
 Thus, these other devices are also different from being connected to the bus in a way because 'high impedance' exists between the bus and its output
 tarksangat dwaar do prakaar ke hote hai - sangyojan tark tathaa anukramik tark
 The output of a combinational logic depends only on the current state of its inputs and not on their earlier state or stages
 duusare shabdon main kah sakate hai ki inamen smriti nahin hoti
 Some examples of this are - binary adapter, encoder, decoder etc
 logic dwaaron kaa upyog ankada-bhandaran ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Latch circuit or 'flip-flop' is used for this
 jab kai flip-flop ko samaantar main jod dete hai to isamen bahu-bit data store kiya ja saktaa he
 This is called a register
 flip-flopon se yukt pranali main ek prakaar kii 'smriti' maujuud he
 That is why computer memory is made from them
 computor kii smriti kai prakaar kii hotin hai
 Any other logic gate can be used using only NOR or only NAND
 isaliye in logic dwaaron ko 'universal logic get' kehete hai
 It is not possible to create any logic function as desired using only AND, or only OR, or only NOT gates
 isaliye AND, OR or NOT get 'universal logic get' nahin hai

 After Titanic, Cameroon embarked on a project that took nearly 10 years: his science-fiction epic Avatar, a milestone specifically for 3D technology, for which he received a nomination for the same Academy Award
 avatar 3 di main aane vaali unki ekmaatr film hone ke baavjood, camerun box offis rajasav ke maamle main sabase safal 3 di film nirmaataa he
 In between making Titanic and Avatar, Cameroon spent several years making several documentary films and co-developed digital 3D fusion camera systems
 ek biographer ne unhen "aanshik rup se vaigyanik evam aanshik rup se kalakaar" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 Cameron has also contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technology
 26 march 2012 ko, camerun deep-si chalanger main pandubbi main mariana trench, samudr ke gahare hisse ke neeche pahunche
 He is the first person to do so in a single lineage, and only the third to do so

 Although Cameron had a strong educational background in the field of natural sciences, he decided to make Philosophy his major subject in 1973 from Fullerton College
 camerun vahaan apane dwaara bitaye gaye samay ke bare main kehete hai, "I am completely self-educated in the field of special effects
 i used to go to the USC library and thesis was written by graduate students about optical printing, or front screen projection, or die transfer, or anything related to film technology
" Used to take it out
 

 or yadi ve mujhe uski photocopy karne kii anumati dete to kar letaa
 yadi nahin, to uske nots bana letaa
" After leaving the middle, he did many things like truck driving and used to sit on writing when he got time
 After watching the original Star Wars film in 1977, Cameron decided to quit the job of a truck driver and enter the film industry

 Cameron said, being stressed he had a nightmare in which an invincible robot hitman from the future is sent to kill him
 isse unhen da termineter film kii prerana mili jisane baad main unke kariyar ko nai unchaaiyaan pradaan kin
 After completing a screenplay for The Terminator, Cameron decided to sell him so that they could direct him
 Although the production companies he contacted expressed interest in it, he was not ready to be given the direction of directing the film director for the first time
 ant main camerun hemdel pikchars naamak ek company ke sampark main aaye jo unase nirdesan karwaane ke liye taiyaar thi

 Also, to highlight the strong feminist theme related to women, the film and a picture of its leading actress, Whiver, appeared on the cover of Time magazine
 After the film's tremendous success, Cameron now had more freedom to make the films he wanted
 camerun kii agali film kaa janm ek aise vichaar se hua jo hai skool kii ek biology kaksha ke dauraan unke dimag main utpann hua tha
 Cameron's screenplay for Abyss became the basis for a story of the staff working in oil wells who learn about otherworldly creatures underwater
 is film main aid haris, mairi elizabeth mastrantonio tathaa maaikel bean ne kaam kiya he
 It was initially budgeted at $ 41 million, due to which it was called one of the most expensive films of its time and required state-of-the-art technology for its special effects
 Since most of the film is underwater and the technology was not advanced enough to digitally create an underwater environment
 camerun ne film ke adhikansh hisse ko 40 feet kii gaharaai par shoot karne kaa nirnay kiya
 The construction building of an incomplete nuclear power plant was converted and two huge tanks were used to construct the set
 mukhya tanks main 7,500,000 america galen tathaa duusare main 2,500,000 america galen pani bharaa gaya
 For the majority of the shooting, all crew members lived there

 Cameron explained, "I wanted someone who was very fast and agile
 If the T-800 is a human panzer tank, the T-1000 is like a Porsche
" " Cameron originally wanted the Terminator of this improved model to be included in his first film, but the special effects at the time were not advanced enough
 da abis main digital tareeke se water tentkal ko dikhaane ke liye istemaal kiye gaye ati unnat effects se camerun ko vishwaas ho gaya ki unke liquid metal khalanaayak kaa nirmaan ab sambhav ho saktaa he
 tristar Pictures agreed to distribute the film, but on the condition that the film would be released within a year of shooting
 Co-written by Cameron and his old friend William Wisher Jr
, the film was to complete the journey from screenplay to release in just that amount of time
 $100 million ke bajet ke saath, camerun kii pichhali film kii tarah hi yah bhi apane yug kii sabase mahangi filmon main se ek thi
 The biggest challenge of the film was the special effects used to make the T-1000
 Nevertheless the film finished on time and it was released in theaters on 3 July 1991

 Mr
 Pyarelal Gupta writes very interestingly in his book "ancient Chhattisgarh" - "chhattisgarhi language is the duhita of Ardha Bhagadhi and the brother of Awadhi"
 " chhattisgadhi or avadhi donon kaa janm ardhamagadhi ke garbh se aaj se lagbhag 1080 varsh purv naveen-dasvin shatabdi main hua tha

 That is why language and literature flourish simultaneously
 parantu ham dekhte he ki chhattisgadhi likhit sahitya ke vikaas ateet main spasht rup main nahin hui he
 Many writers believe that the reason is that in the past, the writers here made Sanskrit the medium of writing and remained a bit indifferent to Chhattisgarhi
 isiilie chhattisgadhi bhashaa main jo sahitya rachaa gaya, vah kareeb ek hazaar saal se hua he
 Many writers have divided this one thousand years in this way: ye vibhaajan saahitiyik pravritiyon ke anusaar kiya gaya he yadhyapi pyarelal gupt ji kaa kahana thik he ki - " sahitya kaa pravaah akhandit or avyahat hota he
 "mr
 Pyarelal Gupta ji goes ahead with a very beautiful estimate -" However, the trends of specific era leave their footprints on the chest of literature: Looking at the nomenclature of trend, one should not think that literature with any specific trends in an era Was composed only
 tathaa anya prakaar kii rachanaaon kii us yug main ekaant abhaav tha
 " yah vibhaajan kisi pravriti kii saapekshik adhikta ko dekhakar kiya gaya he
 Another noteworthy fact is that in other Aryan languages, even in Chhattisgarhi, only the poetic works have been done till the medieval period
