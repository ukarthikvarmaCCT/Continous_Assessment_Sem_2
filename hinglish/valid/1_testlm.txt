 After entering the sanctum sanctorum inside the temple, only the Argha of the Shivalinga is visible, not the linga

 The Trimbakeshwar temple and village is located in the foothills of a hill called Brahmagiri
 is giri ko shiv kaa saakshaat rup mana jaataa he
 It is on this mountain that the holy Godavari river originates
 kaha jaataa he- In ancient times, Trimbak was the taphobhoomi of Gautama Rishi
 apane upar lage gohatya ke paap se mukti paane ke liye gautam rishi ne kathor tap kar shiv se ganga ko yahan avatarit karne kaa vardaan maanga
 As a result, the Ganges, the Godavari River, originated in the south
 godavari ke udgam ke saath hi gautam rishi ke anunay-vinay ke uparaant shivaji ne is mandir main virajman hona sweekaar kar liya
 This place came to be called Trimbak due to the three-eyed Shivshambhu sitting here
 ujjain or omkareshwar kii hi tarah tryambakeshwar maharaj ko is gaanv kaa raja mana jaataa he, isliye har somvaar ko tryambakeshwar ke raja apni praja kaa haal jaanane ke liye nagar bhraman ke liye nikalate hai
 This story is described in Shivpuran about the establishment of this Jyotirlinga
 ek baar maharishi gautam ke tapovana main rahane vaale brahmanon kii patniyaan kisi baat par unki patni ahilya se naaraaz ho gayi
 He inspired his husbands to do sage Gautama
 un brahmanon ne iske nimitt bhagavan shriganeshji kii aradhana kii
 Pleased with his worship, Ganesha appeared and asked him to ask for the groom, those Brahmins said - 'prabhu! If you are happy with us then somehow get Rishi Gautama out of this ashram
 ' unki yah baat sunakar ganeshji ne unhen aisa var maangane ke liye samajhaayaa
 But he remained firm on his request
 antat ganeshji ko vivash hokar unki baat manani padi
 To keep the mind of his devotees, he took the form of a weak cow and started living in the field of sage Gautama
 gaay ko fasal charate dekhakar rishi badi narmi ke saath haath main trin lekar use haankane ke liye lapke
 As soon as those trunks were touched, that cow fell there itself
 ab to bada haahaakaar machaa
 All the Brahmins gathered and started denouncing the sage Gautama as a cow killer
 rishi gautam is ghatana se bahut aashcharyachakit or duhkhi the
 Now all those Brahmins said that you should leave this ashram and go somewhere else
 go-hatyare ke nikat rahane se hamen bhi paap lagegaa
 Being compelled, the sage Gautama started living with his wife Ahilya a curse away from there
 kintu un brahmanon ne vahaan bhi unka rahanaa dubhar kar diya
 They started saying - 'now you have no right to do the work of Vedas and Yajnadi due to cow slaughter
 ' atyant anunay bhav se rishi gautam ne un brahmanon se prarthana kii ki aap log mere praayshchit or uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataaen
 Then he said- 'gautam! You can revolve the whole earth thrice by telling your sins everywhere to everyone
 phir lautakar yahan ek maheene tak vrath karo
 After this, after doing 101 circumambulation of 'brahmagiri' you will be purified or bring Gangaji here and bathe with water and worship Shiva with one crore earthly Shivalingas
 iske baad punah gangaji main snaan karke is brahmagiri kii 11 baar parikrama karo
 Then bathing the earthly Shivalingas with the holy water of hundred pots will save you
 brahmanon ke kathananusaar maharishi gautam ve saare kaary puure karke patni ke saath purnatah tallin hokar bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana karne lage
 Pleased with this, Lord Shiva appeared and asked him to ask for the groom
 maharishi gautam ne unase kaha- 'bhagavan main yahi chahta hoon ki aap mujhe go-hatya ke paap se mukt kar den
 'lord Shiva said-' Gautam! You are completely sinless
 go-hatya kaa aparaadh tum par chal purvak lagaaya gaya tha
 i want to punish the Brahmins of your ashram who have done this deceitfully
 ' On this Maharishi Gautam said that Lord! i have received your darshan for his sake only
 ab unhen meraa paramahit samajhakar un par aap krodh na karen
 Many sages, sages and devas gathered there, approving Gautam's talk and prayed to Lord Shiva to stay there forever
 ve unki baat maanakar vahaan tryambak jyotirling ke naam se sthit ho gaye
 Gangaji brought by Gautam ji also started to flow near there under the name Godavari
 yah jyotirling samast punyon ko pradaan karne vaala he
 During this trip, the panchmukhi gold mask of Trimbakeshwar Maharaj is seated in a palanquin and rotated in the village
 phir kushavart tirth sthit ghat par snaan karaayaa jaataa he
 The mask is then brought back to the temple and a diamond crown is worn
 yah puraa drishy tryambak maharaj ke rajbhishek-sa mahasoos hota he
 It is a supernatural experience to see this journey
 ‘kushavart tirth kii janmakatha kaaphi rochak he
 It is said that Godavari river used to disappear from Brahmagiri mountain again and again
 godavari ke palaayan ko rokane ke liye gautam rishi ne ek kusha kii madad lekar godavari ko bandhan main band diya
 Since then there is always plenty of water in this pool
 is kunda ko hi kushavart tirth ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 At the time of Kumbh bath, Shaiva Akhara takes royal bath in this pool
 ’- danta katha Devotees throng to the Trimbakeshwar temple on the day of Shivaratri and Sawan Monday

 There is also a special puja called Kalasarpa Yoga and Narayana Nagabali, due to which people keep coming here throughout the year

 Hart has included Hazrat Umar in his famous book The Hundred The 100: a Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History
 hazarat umr kaa janm makka main hua tha
 These were from Quraish Khanadan
 agyanta ke dinon main hi likhnaa padhanaa sikh liya tha, jo ki us jamaane main arab log likhnaa padhanaa bekaar kaa kaam samajhate the
 He had a very tall, bold face and a muscular body
 umr makka ke mashhoor pahalawaanon main se ek the, jinka puure makka main bada dabadabaa tha
 Umar used to participate in the annual wrestling matches
 armbh main hazarat umr islam ke kattar shatru the
 And wanted to kill Muhammad sahib
 umr shuru main but parasti karte the
 Omar was from a rich family in Mecca, a very brave and courageous person
 umr musalamaanon ko pasand nahin karte the, naa hi mohammad sahab ke mishan ko
 But Prophet Muhammad sahab went to Kabaa one evening and prayed to Allah that Allah should give Umar or Amr Abu Jahl to both of you who are dear to you
 yah dua umr ke haq main qabool hui
 Omar had once set out with the intention of killing the Prophet, a man named Naeem was found on the way who told Omar that his sister and her husband had brought Islam
 umr gusse main aakar bahan ke ghar chal diye
 Both of them were studying Quran at home
 umr unase kuran maangane lage magar unhone manaa kar diya
 Omar became angry and started killing them both
 magar unki bahan ne kaha ham mar jaaenge lekin islam nahin chodenge
 Omar felt ashamed to see the blood dripping from his sister's face and realized the mistake
 kaha ki main kuran padhanaa chahta hoon, isko apamaanit nahin karuunga vaayada kiya
 When Omar read the Quran, he said that it is the declaration of God that no human being can be created
 ek chamatkaar kii tarah se umr kuran ke satya ko grahan kar liya tathaa mohammad sahab se milane gayi
 Muhammad Sahab was very happy when Omar entered Islam
 musalamaanon khushi kii lahar daud gai umr ke islam laane par
 Omar announced that now everyone will study together in the Namaz Kabe, which no one could have imagined earlier
 umr islam ke shatru the parantu ab vah islam ke sarankshak ban gayi
 Seeing Omar in Islam created a furore among Muhammad's enemies
 ab islam ko umr naam kii ek tej talwaar mil gai thi jisase sara makka tharrata tha
 The Meccans hurled their sobs at the weak Muslims, upon which Muhammad sahab prayed to Allah, then Allah ordered him to go to Medina
 saare musalmaan chhupakar madeene kii taraf hizrat yani pravaas karne lage
 But Omar was very courageous, took his sword, took a bow and shot, reached near the Kaaba and did a tawaaf, read two rakat hymns and then said "who wants to make his mother cry on himself, orphan his children and widow his wife
" Meet the place
 " kisi kaa saahas nahin hua ki umr ko roke
 Omar declared his obeisance
 madina islam kaa ek nayaa kendra ban chukaa tha
 Sun Hijri created the Islamic calendar which is called the Almanac of Islam
 624 i main musalamaanon ko badr kii jang ladanaa padaa jisamen hazarat umr ne bhi aham kirdaar nibhaayaa
 In the battle of Badr, Muslims were defeated and the Musharis of Mecca were defeated
 badr kii jang ke ek saal baad makka vaale ekajute ho kar madeene pe hamalaa karne aa gaye, jang uhud naamak pahari ke paas hui
 In the beginning of the war, the Muslim army was heavy but due to some reasons the Muslims were defeated
 kuch logon ne afvaah uda di ki mohammad sahab shahid kar diye gayi to bahut se muslim ghabara gaye, umr ne bhi talwaar phenk di tathaa kehane lage ab jeena bekaar he
 After some time i came to know that this is a rumor and then stood again
 iske baad khandak kii jang main saath-saath rahe
 Omar led the Muslim army and finally Mecca also conquered
 iske baad bhi kai jangon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, umr ne un sabhi jango main netratav kiya
 On 8 June 632, Muhammad Sahib said goodbye to the world
 umr tathaa kuch log ye vishwaas hi naa rakhte the ki mohammad sahab kii mutyu bhi ho sakati he
 On hearing this news, Umar lost his senses, took out his sword and started saying loudly that i will separate his head from the person who said that the prophet has died
 is najuk maukey par tabhi hazarat abu bakr ne musalamaanon ko ek khutaba arthath bhaashan diya jo bahut mashhoor he: Then read the verse of the Quran: hazarat abu bakr se sunakar tamaam log gash khaakar gir gayi, umr bhi apane ghutanon ke bal gir gayi tathaa is bahut baden du:kha ko sweekaar kar liya
 When Hazrat Abu Bakr felt that his time was near, he chose Hazrat Umar for the next Khalifa
 umr unki asaadhaaran ichha shakti, buddhi, raajnneetik, nishpakshta, nyaay or garibon or vanchiton logon ke liye dekhbhaal ke liye acchhee tarah se jane jate the
 Hazrat Abu Bakr was fully aware of Omar's power and his ability to succeed
 umr kaa uttaradhikaar is prakaar ke rup main dusron ke kisi bhi rup main pareshaani nahin tha
 Hazrat Abu Bakr wrote his will to Hazrat Usman before his death that Omar would be his successor
 agast, san 634 i main hazarat abu bakr kii mrityu ho gai
