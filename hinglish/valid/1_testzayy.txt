 He came to India three times by ship

 Vasco da Gama was presumably born in 1460 or 1469 near the southwest coast of Signs, Portugal

 The erstwhile Signs, now one of the few ports on the coast of Alentejo, then had a cluster of whitewashed, red-roofed fishermen's huts

 vasco da gamma ke parivaar kii aarambhik jaankaree adhik gyaat nahin he
 Portuguese historian Teixeira de Aragão states that Vasco da Gama was educated in the city of राvora, where he may have acquired knowledge of mathematics and navigation
 yah bhi gyaat he ki gamma ko khagolashastra kaa bhi gyaan tha, jo unhone sambhawatah khagolgy abraham zakuto se liya hoga
 In 1492, King John II of Portugal sent Gama south of the port of Setubal, Lisbon
 unhen vahaan se francisi jahaajon ko pakad kar laana tha
 Vasco completed this task with skill and readiness

 He told his father this
 jon kaa ek sevak abhi suta se muslim qaidiyon ke badale dhan lekar lautaa tha
 After the coming of Islam under the rule of the last seven hundred years, it would certainly have been a selective task if Suta was defeated by the Portuguese invasion
 suta naa sirf ek vyast pattan bazaar tha, balki us samay morocco, pichley 30 saalon se araajaktaa main fansaa tha
 After much disrespect and Queen Philippa's insistence, John prepared a plan of attack

 In July 1415, Ceuta was conquered

 But nothing was achieved financially - the Muslims started trading with Tanziers instead of Sutah, and the ports of Sayuta remained empty
 us samay europe main kai bhrantiyaan prachlit thi
 One of them was that in Africa, somewhere in the south, a gold river flows
 par vahaan pahunchne kaa matlab he sahaara marusthal main maujuud muslim arab or barbar sena ko haraana
 In Henry's view it was possible and necessary to do this - after all, seven hundred years ago North Africa was under Christian occupation

 Tangier was farther away and more secure

 As expected - he had to face defeat

 Diego again traveled to Namibia in 1486, once again in search of his goal - just 800 kilometers north of the southern point of Africa
 lekin, lautate samay wo congou main prester jon ko dhundne niklaa or phir uskaa koi pataa nahin chalaa
 One of the misconceptions prevalent in Europe was that somewhere in the east, there lived a king named Prester John who is a Christian and owns immense wealth
 purtagaaliyon ko bharosa tha ki ye raja bharat kaa raja he
 To find out, Portuguese King John sent two detectives on a landward journey to the east
 lekin jerusalem pahunchne ke baad unhen maaloom hua ki arabi siikhe bina aage badhanaa sambhav nahin he - ve laut gaye
 After this, in May 1487, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Peva were sent on a secret journey
 ve misr main sikandriyaa or kahiraa pahunch gaye
 Pero Aden from them reached Calicut via Red Sea
 vyapaar or margon ko usne nirikshan kiya or kahiraa laut gaya
 There he met two Portuguese Jews who were sent by King John
 jaankariyon kaa aadan pradaan hua or kowilha dakshin kii ore ithiopia chalaa gaya
 He wanted to return from there, but seeing his world knowledge, King Alexander appointed his advisor and promised to send him to Portugal later

 Kovilha settled there

 In August of 1487, the Portuguese king sent a sailor named Bartolomeo Dias to travel to Africa
 wo pehla european navik tha jo dakshintam africa ke tat - uttamasha antareep - ke paar pahunchaa
 But returned after being defeated by a fierce storm
 lekin uske pashchim se purab kii taraf ja sakane se yah sabit ho gaya ki africa kaa dakshini konaa he or duniya yaheen khatm nahin ho jaati
 Meanwhile, King Manuel proposed the idea of a four-boat crew to India
 is dal kaa captain gamma ko chunaa gaya
 Many were astonished by this - because Gama did not experience any major maritime challenge other than the battles around
 lekin anushaasit or raja ke vishwast hone ke kaaran use niyukt kar liya gaya
 On 8 July 1497, four ships left Lisbon and began their first voyage to India
 lagbhag 170 logon ke is bede ke anya mahatvapurn naamon main martim aphonso or farnaao martins kaa naam tha
 Afonso had lived in the Congo and knew African dialects, while Fernao was an imprisonment in Morocco due to his imprisonment

 As expected, there were no women aboard the ship
 chalane ke ek saptaah baad, 15 july ko wo kenneri tak pahunche or uske baad chhaae dhundh kii vajah se jahaaj alag ho gaye
 They were scheduled to meet in Cape Verde, but Paolo de Gama did not see any other ship there
 halanki berio or bhandaaran jahaaj kuch ghanto ke bheetar aa gaye
 Gamma's ship was not found for the next four days
 milane ke baad wo vahaan ek saptaah tak ruke or phir 3 agast ko ravaanaa hue
 In all the Portuguese voyages so far, sailors' ships had passed through the Nicach off the coast of Africa - also to Bartelomeo Dias
 lekin ek tufaani hawa, jo khule atlantic main bahati he navikon ko uttamasha antareep tak teji se dhakel detii he -aisa vasco da gamma ne sun rakhaa tha
 Instead of turning east, his own sailors were told to walk south in the open sea instead of walking in Africa
 kai dinon tak khule samudr main chalane or koi jameen yaa aashaa na dekhne ke baad 1 navambar wo jameen ke nikat aae
 It must have been some 150 kilometers before Uttamaha

 After restoring the ship and seeing its maps, people rested

 They wear leather garments and dogs always walk with them
 vahaan se wo 16 navambar ko chale
 The Bulkul coast line did not match the map of Bertlemeo Dias, but the bay continued to move and reached Uttamaasha Antip on 22 November
 vahaan par dias dwaara sthaneey logon ke saath hue jhadpon kii khabar unhen mil chuki thi, lekin unke saath bhi vahaan par jhadap ho gai
 After repairing the ships, he left from there on 7 December
 16 disambar ko wo us nadi ke muhane par pahunche jahaan se bartelomeu dias ke navikon ne use waapas jane par majaboor kiya tha
 He saw a cross installed by Dias there
 iske baad ke raaston par aaj tak koi nahin pahunchaa tha - isliye pehle se bane maanchitr bekaar ho gaye or unhen nayaa maanchitr bananaa padaa
 They moved north along the coast
 chunki vah christmas ke aasapaas kaa samay tha, da gamma ke karmidal ne ek tat kaa naam, jisase hokar ve guzar rahe the, "nataal" rakhaa
 It means "christmas" in Portuguese and the name of that place is still in use till date
 janvari tak ve log aaj ke mozambik tak pahunch gaye the, jo purvi africa kaa ek tateey kshetra he jisapar arab logon ne hind mahaasaagar ke vyapaar network ke ek bhaag ke rup main niyantran kar rakhaa tha
 They were chased by an angry mob who came to know that they are not Muslims and they proceeded to Kenya
 kenya ke mombasa main bhi uskaa virodh hua
 After arriving, he was told that there are many Christians living in the city of Mombasa
 jahaaj ko tat se dur rakhane ke baad kuch navik shahar ke daure par gaye jahaan unhen gore isaiyon se mulaakaat hui
 Later it was learned that after receiving news from Mozambique, the Sultan there had prepared a plan to trap him
 gamma vahaan se bhaag niklaa - par use bharat pahunchne ke liye dishaao ke jaankaar navikon yaa nideshkon kii zarurat thi
 He caught four people coming on a small boat
 ek buudhe musalmaan vyapaaree ne bataaya ki paas ke tat malindi main bhartiya navik rahete hai
 Vasco reached Malindi seeing no choice
 bharatiyon ko deshkar use laga ki ye isai he - krishna ke uccharan ko wo christ samaj rahe the
 In Malindi, The Gama hired an Indian guide, who led the Portuguese on the forward route and brought them to Calicut, Kerala, on 20 May 1498, which is located on the southwest coast of India
 vahaan ke raja ne unhen kalikat ke pattan par aane kaa nyauta diya lekin gamma ke raah main itani baadhaayen ain thim ki use laga ki ye bhi dushman hi honge
 But he met Vali to meet and then Zamorin welcomed Gamma to Calicut with music
 vahaan par raaj-darbar main aane se pehle use ek mandir mila jahaan andar main use ek devi kii murti mila
 The Portuguese felt that this was a statue of Mary and she was convinced that Zamorin was a Christian ruler
 wo murti shaayad mariammaa devi kii thi jise wo isamsih kii maan mariyam samaj rahe the
 The comedian who was included in the group with Gamma who was welcomed by Jamorin wrote - "the people of this country are brown, short-sighted and at first look jealous and mean
 mard qamar ke upar kuch nahin pahante 
 Some have long hair, while many have shaved heads
 mahilaayein saamanyatya sundar nahin dikhti hai
 "fernão Martins translated Gamma into Arabic meeting Zamorin
 darbar main muslim salaahkaaron ne use vyapaar kii baat karne main kai adchane paidaa kii
 He ridiculed Gama's gift and delayed him to meet the king
 iske alaave uske paas raja ke liye uchit koi uphaar bhi nahin tha
 For this reason he had a fight with Zamorin
 zamorin ke muslim mantriyon ne usase vyapaar kaa kar maanga
 Zamorin also refuses to erect the pillar he had requested
 sulah or phir ladaai chalati rahi
 The king's Muslim ministers kidnapped many people from his entourage
 lekin samudr main unke jahaaj par aae graahakon ko gamma ne bandi bana liya
 Finally he was allowed to leave and in the end of August he left - the king also gave him a citation in Malayalam containing a message to King John of Portugal that Vasco had come here
 lekin agle hi din koi 70 arabi jahaaj vahaan akraman ke liye aate dikhe
 In response, he fired
 kuch bhartiya bandhakon ke saath sitambar 1498 main waapas portugal ke liye laut gaya
 He reached the Swahili coast again in January
 jahaaj par koi 500 din guzar gaye the - log thak or biimaar ho chale the
 While living some 2 weeks away from home on the West African coast, his brother - and captain of one of the crew's three ships, Paulo the Gamma - fell ill and was killed
 usne baaqi jahaajon ko lisbon laut jane kaa aadesh diya or bhai ko dafanaane ke baad apane dal se peeche lisbon pahunchaa
 He received a fierce reception there
 gamma ne waapas aakar apana vrittant raja manuel ko sunaaya
 Contrary to his prejudices, he found the Christians of India different and could not recognize Portugal - which surprised him
 bharat main muslimon kii upasthiti se bhi use duvidha hui
 Seeing the Muslim rule everywhere in Africa and the number of Muslim merchants in the Arabian Sea, he remembered his "christian duty" and sent two more missions within two years
 janvari 1500 isvi kaa samay bahut hi shubhankar laga, par mishan bhejne main 2 maheenon kii deree ho gai
 In March 1500, 13 ships headed by Pedro ारेlvarez Cabral sailed from Lisbon
 unka lakshya africa or bharat main vyapaar ke aadhaar lagane ke alaave jamorin ko muslim vyapaariyon ko bhaga dene kaa aagrah bhi tha
 But many ships were lost in order to go southwest and then east of Gamma's stated approach to reach Uttamaasha
 kaabral kalikat pahunchaa - nae jamorin ne europea jahaajon kaa vyapaar sweekaar kiya or suraksha kaa aashwaasan diya
 But Arab merchants had reached the port for that year
 kebral ne arab jahaaj ko pakad liya - ye kahkar ki ye jamorin ke saath hui vyapaar sandhi kaa ulanghan he
 In response, he killed all 70 people of the Portuguese factory
 lekin kaabral kii yatra purna asafalataa nahin thi - usne aate vaqt sophala or kilva ke raajaaon se sampark sthapit kiya
 He also went to Coonoor in India and some ships that were "lost" - reached South America
 isse pehle ke kabral laut paata, manuel pratham ne hoaao da nova ke netritv main 4 jahaajon ke saath niklaa
 a message left by Kabral was found hanging in an old shoe on the coast of Africa and reached Calicut
 vahaan pahunchakar usne kai muslim jahaajon par akraman kiya
 a factory in Coonoor returned to Lagar, Portugal
 is prakaar portugal ke jahaajon ne agle 20 saalon ke liye usne kalikat ke shaskaon se dushmani mol le lee
 In 1502, Vasco was repatriated
 uski agali yatra 1502 main hui, jab use ye gyaat hua kii kalikat ke logon ne peeche chhot gaye sabhi portugaliyon ko maar daalaa he
 He dismantled all the Indian and Arab ships en route to his voyage and proceeded to control Calicut and seized much wealth
 isse portugal kaa raja usase bahut prasann hua
 He also went to Cochin, Coonoor and Goa
 cochin ke dakshin main use sadiyon se rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa chalaa
 Gama left some Portuguese there and the ruler of that city also asked him to leave everything he had left there, but he escaped from there
 uski duusari yatra portugali raja ke mishan ke hisaab se bahut safal rahaa kyonki usne arab vyapaariyon ke kadi ladaai kii - jamorin ko vyapaar ke liye majaboor kiya or bharat main rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa lagaaya
 In 1524, he set out on his last visit to India
 us samay portugal kii bharat main upnivesh basti ke viceroy ke rup main aayaa, par vahaan pahunchne ke kuch samay baad uski mrityu ho gai
 Vasto de Gama was one of the most important ocean explorers after Portuguese prince and explorer Henry
 teen mahadeshon or do mahasaagaron ko paar karne ke baad bhi arab sagar main arab vyapaariyon or africa samrajyon se ladane or phir bharat aakar apane saath laae portugali raaj-sandesh tathaa uski hifaazat ke liye raja se yuddh or safalataa uske drudh-nishchay ko dikhaati he
 Vasco was rewarded as a successful soldier in Portugal upon his return
 apane samakaleen columbus ke mukaable uski lambi yatra main bhi baghaavat nahin hui or thakne ke baad bhi apane lakshya par jame rahaa
 The spice trade of Arab and Moore merchants was greatly hit when Vasco da Gama reached India
 is vyapaar ko hathiyaane ke liye vasco da gamma ne na sirf khatarnaak or parishramee yatra kii, balki kai yuddh bhi ladaa
 With the help of his superior guns, he was successful in most battles
 isse adan -hormuj -kalikat jal-vyapaar maarg tut yaa kamazor pad gaya
 Seeing his success, King Manuel of Portugal undertook many missions in India and the East
 albukark, jo uski tasri yatra se pehle portugal se bheja gaya tha, ne arab sagar main arabon ke vyapaar or saamudrik sena or sampatti ko tahas-nahas kar diya or khoji malaysia or phir china tak pahunch gaye
 By the sixteenth century, broken Arabic became the language of Portuguese trade instead of Arabic
 is samay portugal ek saamudrik shakti ban gaya
 Where he once reached in India is named vasco-di-gama in his honor
 chaand ke ek gadhde kaa or portugal main kai sadakon kaa naam vasco ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Originally made in 2011, he is portrayed as a villain in the Malayalam film Urumi, directed by Santosh Shivan

 Residents here played an important role in the uprising of 1857
 inamen mukhya krantikari the- choudhary jabardast khan evam choudhary ulfat khan
 Chaudhary tremendous Khan and Chaudhary Ulfat Khan along with their supporters were put to death because of their involvement in revolution against the British
 lekin unki shahadat ko hapur ke nivasee aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The Martyr's Fair is organized every year since 1975 AD in Hapur to commemorate the revolutionaries who died in 1857
 jo 10 may se shuru hokar ek maah tak chalata he
 This type of fair associated with 1857 is not held anywhere else in the whole country
 choudhary jabardast khan kaa parivaar multah asoda gaanv kaa rahane vaala tha jo apni jameendaari hone ke kaaran baad main hapur ke muhalla bhanda pattee main rahane lage
 Chaudhary had seven brothers, including Zahir Khan, Samast Khan, Ulfat Khan, Amjad Khan, Groom Khan, and a sister
 malagarh ke nawab validaad khan tathaa choudhary jabardast khan ke madhya dostana sambandh the
 "the son of Nawab Walidad Khan was married to the only daughter of Nawab Muzaffarnagar
 baraat malagarh se mujffarnagar ke liye ravaanaa hui
 The procession was to pass through Hapur as it was on the way
 yahan aane par nawab validaad khan ne choudhary jabardast khan ko baraat kaa mukhiya banaakar bheja or swayan waapas laut gaye
 This incident confirms the friendly relationship between the two
 nawab mujffarnagar dwaara baraat tathaa choudhary jabardast khan kaa bhavy swaagat kiya gaya
 The procession stayed at Nawab Muzaffarnagar for more than two months, even the people who used to get the information of the procession are not allowed to return, due to which the number of the processions increased considerably
 nawab validaad ke sthaan par choudhary jabardast khan ne var ke pita kaa uttardatiytav nibhaayaa
 The Nawab was the only daughter of Muzaffarnagar, so the Nawab surrendered his entire property to his girl and son-in-law
 " Our guess is that Walidad Khan would not have been able to go to the son's wedding due to his involvement in some secret and very important work, and that this work would not have been scheduled in advance, but it would have suddenly taken place
 yadi is kaary vishesh kaa pehle se abhas bhi hota, to nawab validaad shah kii tithi peeche hataa sakate the
 Also, work will be of such great importance that at the time of marriage, they could neither postpone the marriage nor delay the work
 aakhir prashn uthta he ki yah kaary vastav main kya tha? hamaara mat he ki yah kaam or kuch na hokar 1857 kii kranti kaa prasphuton se purv isaki yojana athwa iske yojanakaaron se sampark sambandhit rahaa hoga
 The evidence group under the then circumstances reinforces the presumption that the time of marriage will be around the spring of 1857
 is par vichaar karne se sahaj hi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Historians are unanimous that a sudden revolution erupted from Meerut on 10 May 1857
 atah aise main yah sakshyasangat na hoga ki iske prasphuton kaa validaad khan ko purv abhas ho
 Therefore, it can be easily arrived at the conclusion that the date of marriage must have been long before the 10th of May
 aisa maan lene par pita validaad khan ne apni putr kii shaadi main amuly samay nasht karne kii apeksha yah uchit samajha hoga ki yojanakaaron se sampark sthapit kar kranti main apni bhoomika nirvahan kiya jaye
 Nawab Walidad Khan was a visionary

 krantikariyon ne hapur evam bulandashah ke madhya sabhi telephone ke taron ko kaat diya

 It is believed that Chaudhary Tremendous Khan was hanged thrice, but on three occasions the noose was broken
 yah dekhakar british adhikari wilson ne aashcharya vyakt kiya or jabardast khan ko usne jivit chhodane kaa man bana liya
 Chaudhary tremendous Khan was removed from the gallows and ordered to be fed on his water
 parantu jabardast khan ke virdohi nahin chaahate the ki use jinda choda jaye
 He prayed to the British officer that if Chaudhary tremendous Khan was left alive, he would not leave us alive
 kyonki unhone kranti ke dauraan choudhary jabardast khan ke viruddh britaniyon kii madad kii thi, atah unki vinati ko wilson ne sweekaar kar liya
 When tremendous Khan was drinking water, he shot at his temple
 choudhary jabardast khan desh ke liye shahid ho gayi
 The British officer also ordered the confiscation of his entire property and the death penalty to other family members
 abdulla khan tathaa vadulla khan, jo choudhary jabardast khan ke putr bataaye jate hai, ko unke ek swamibhakt naukar chhipaakar hapur se dur le gaye or kai varsho baad jab hapur main shaanti hui tabhi ve waapas aaye

 The outcome of the referendum could have a dramatic effect on the UK economy and politics
 ye asar europe or anya deshon ko bhi apane daayre main le saktaa he

50, but when the results started trending in favor of separation from the European Union, the pound came to $ 1
