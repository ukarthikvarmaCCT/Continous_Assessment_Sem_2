 Due to which the newborn gets the disease of blood decompensation, it is a disease of pneumatic anemia which can be mild to severe

 However, more serious inconsistencies can cause a severe immune response, leading to a lot of red blood cell destruction, lowered blood pressure, and even death
 anti--a or anti-b, jo ABO rakt samooh pranali ke RBC sataha ke pratijanon ke liye aam igm pratirakshi hai, unhen kabhi kabhi "prakritik rup se utpann" ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he; haalanki yah ek mithyaa he, kyonki in pratirakshiyon kaa nirmaan navjaat avasthaa main samvedikaran ke dwaara usee prakaar se hota he jaise anya pratirakshiyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Explaining how these antibodies evolved, the theory explains that the antigen, food, like the a and b antigens

 Due to these and-so-called "naturally occurring" and anticipated antibodies, it is important that the blood group of the patient is properly determined before blood transfusion

 It is not necessary to determine any other blood group because almost all red cell antibodies develop only through active immunity, which may be due to previously raised blood or pregnancy

 rhd antigen is also important in determining a person's blood group

 Unlike anti-a and anti-b antibodies, anti-rhd is not a naturally occurring antibody
 rhd pratijan kaa milan bhi bahut mahatvapurn he, kyonki rhd pratijan pratijanik hota he, arthath ek vyakti jo rhd rinatmak he, vah rhd pratijan ke sampark main aane par anti-rhd bana letaa he 
 Once a person is sensitized to rhd antigens, their blood becomes rhd igg antibodies, which bind to rhd positive red blood cells and can cross the placenta

 There is no need to consider the possible reaction of anti-a, anti-b antibodies present in the red blood cells of the transfused blood of the receptor, because relatively small amounts of plasma containing antibodies are transferred, udhaaharan ke dwaara: aisa maanate hue ki o rhd rinatmak rakt kaa sthaanantaran a rhd dhanatmak rakt samooh ke grahi main kiya ja rahaa he, grahi ke anti-b pratirakshiyon or aadhanit laal rakt koshikaon ke bich ek pratirakshi abhikriya kii ummid nahin kii jaati he
 Although increased blood contains a relatively small amount of anti-a antibody in plasma, it can act with the a antigen on the surface of the receptor's red blood cells, but a significant response is unlikely due to the dilution factors

 In linguistics, the noun is a member of a large, free lexical class, whose members may exist as key words of the subject of the phrase, karma of the verb, or karma of the preposition
 shabdic virgon ko is sandarbh main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he ki unke sadsy abhivyaktiyon ke anya prakaaron ke saath kis tarah sanyojit hote hai
 The syntactic rules for nouns vary
 angrezi main, sangya ko un shabdon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jo upapad or gunavachak visheshnon ke saath hote hai or sangya vaakyansh ke sheersh ke rup main kaary kar sakate hai
 Noun is one of the eight terms in traditional English grammar
 yah shabd latin ke nomen se vyutpann he, jiskaa arth he naam 
 sangya jaise shabd virgon ko sabase pehle sanskrit vyakaran] tathaa dianysios thraiks jaise pracheen unaniyon ne varnit kiya or unke rupavidhan gunon ke sandarbh main unki paribhaasha di gai
 For example, in Ancient Greek, nouns refer to the verb form for grammatical factor, such as denominative factor or karma factor
 prakritik bhashaa kii abhivyaktiyon main vibhinn staron par visheshtaayen hoti hai
 These have formal features, such as what kind of morphological prefix or suffix they take and which are combined with other types of expressions; But they are also associated with semantic features, that is, properties related to their meaning
 Thus the definition of noun at the beginning of this article is a formal traditional grammatical definition
 vah paribhaasha, adhikanshtah, avivaadaaspad maani jaati he or katipay bhashaaon ke upyogkartaaon ke liye anek sangyaaon ko gair sangyaaon se prabhavi rup se antar samajhane kaa saadhan prastut karti he
 However, it has an inconvenience that it does not apply to nouns in all languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, roosi main koi nishchayvachak upapad maujuud nahin hai, atah sangyaaon ko aise shabdon ke rup main paribhaashit nahin kiya ja saktaa he jo nishchayvachak upapadon dwaara sanshodhit hote hai
 There have also been several attempts to define nouns based on their semantic characteristics
 inamen kai vivaadaaspad hai, lekin kuch kii neeche charchaa kii ja rahi he
 The traditional ideology of grammar is often confronted with the definition of nouns that they are all and only expressions that refer to a person, place, object, event, substance, quality, quantity, or idea, etc
 yah arthgat paribhaasha he
 It has been criticized by contemporary linguists as non-informative
 samakaleen bhashavid aam taur par sahamat hai ki sangyaaon kii is aadhaar par safal paribhaasha sambhav nahin he ki ve kin duniya kii vastuon ko sanderbhit karte yaa suchit karte hai
 The definition of the problem uses relatively common nouns to define what nouns are
 aise saamaanya sangyaaon kaa astitv darshata he ki sangyaaen aise tatwon ko sanderbhit karti hai jo vargeekaran padanukramon main suvyavasthit hai
 But other types of expressions are also organized into such structured classification relations
 udhaaharan ke liye kriyaapad stroll, saunter, stride or tread adhik saamaanya walk se zyaada vishisht shabd hai - dekhen Troponymy
 iske alaava, kriya move kii tulana main walk adhik vishisht he, jab ki change kii tulana main kam saamaanya
 lekin yah sambhaavna nahin he ki is tarah ke vargeekaran sambandhon kaa upyog nouns or verbs ko paribhaashit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 We cannot define verbs as words that refer to changes or states, for example, nouns changes and stages may refer to such things, but they are certainly not verbs
 isi prakaar, invasion, meeting, yaa collapse jaisi sangyaaen ho chuki yaa hone vaali chizon ko sanderbhit karte hai
 In fact, an influential theory is that verbs like kill or die refer to events, a category of things that is expected to be mentioned by a noun
 yahaan yah tark nahin diya ja rahaa he ki kriyaapadon ke bare main yah drushti galat he, balki yah ki kriya kaa yah gun is shrenee kii paribhaasha ke liye kamazor aadhaar he, thik usee prakaar jaise pahiyon kii maujuudagi car kii paribhaasha kaa ek kamazor aadhaar he 
 isi prakaar, yellow yaa difficult jaise visheshnon ke bare main yah sochaa ja saktaa he ki ve gunon kaa ullekh kar rahe hai or outside yaa upstairs jaise kriyavisheshan sthaan ko sanderbhit karte hue prathit hote hai, joki aisi chizon main hai jinka sangyaaen ullekh kar sakati hai
 But verbs, adjectives and adverbs are not nouns and nouns are not adverbs, adjectives or adverbs
 is par bahes kiya ja saktaa he ki ye is tarah kii paribhaashaayen vastav main vaktaa ke sangya, kriya or visheshan ke bare main purv sahaj gyaan par he ki ve kya hai or, isamen yaa isse zyaada vastav main kuch or nahin jodate hai
 Speakers' intuitive understanding of these may possibly be based on formal standards in viewing, such as the traditional grammatical definition of English nouns mentioned above
 saanchaa:unclear sectionbritisa tarkshastri peter thomas gich ne nouns ke adhik daksh arthgat paribhaasha ko prastaavit kiya
 He observed that adjectives such as "same" can limit the meaning of noun but not other words such as verbs or adjectives
 Not only this, there do not appear to be any other expressions with the same meaning that modify verbs and adjectives
 Consider the following examples
 angrezi main samely koi kriyavisheshan nahin he
 However, analogous adverbs of the samely exist in some other languages, such as Czech
 isliye check main, pichley vaakya kaa anuwaad sahi hoga: tathaapi, uskaa matlab yah hoga ki jon or bill ekasmaan lade: na ki donon ne ek hi ladaai main hissaa liya
 Geach proposed Geach that we can denote it, if it denotes logical predicate, including identity standards
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek pahchaan kasuti hamen nishkarsh nikaalane degi ki vyakti x samay 1 main or vyakti y samay 2 main ek hi vyakti he
 Different noun will have different identity standard
 a well-known example of this is due to Gupta: yah dekhte hue ki saamaanya rup se sabhi yatri vyakti hai, uparyukt antim vaakya ko tarksangat rup se pehle kaa anugaman karnaa chahie
 lekin aisa nahin he
 For example, it is easy to imagine that on average, in 1979, everyone traveling on National Airlines traveled with them twice
 In such a case, it can be said that the airline transported 2 crore passengers, but only 1 crore persons
 Thus, our method of counting of passengers is not the same as the method of counting of persons
 kuch alag tarah yahi baat kahen to: jo alag samay main, aap do alag yatriyon ke samanurup honge, bhale hi aap ek or vahi vyakti hai
 For the exact definition of the identification standard, see Gupta
 saanchaa:unclear sectionnouns kii ek or arthgat paribhaasha he ki ve adipraroopatah nirdeshaatmak hai
 More recently, Mark Baker has proposed that the definition of geech in terms of identity standards in relation to nouns permits the interpretation of the formative features of nouns
 unka tark he ki nouns nishchayvachak upapadon or sankhyaon ke saath paae ja sakate hai or ve adipraroopatah nirdeshaatmak hai kyonki ve sab or keval shabdabhed ke ve ansh hai jo pahchaan maanak uplabdh karaate hai
 Baker's proposals are fairly new and linguists are still evaluating them
 Proper nouns adwitiya tatwon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaali sangyaaen hai, joki tatwon ke varg kaa varnan karne vaale common nouns se bhinn hai
 Normally prefixes or other restrictive diacritics are not used before Proper nouns and are used to denote a particular person, place or object without regard to any descriptive meaning of the word or phrase
 vyaktivaachak sangya ke bade akshar main arth, antarnihit sandarbh main adwitiyata he, arthath jab koi udhaaharan antarnihit sandarbh main adwitiya he to saamaanya prakaar ke udhaaharan ko yah ek naam pradaan karata he
 Therefore, as discussed later, the context change may affect this
 angrezi or adhikansh anya bhashaaon main, jo latin varnmaala kaa upyog karte hai, aam taur par vyaktivaachak sangyaaon ko bade aksharon main likhaa jaataa he
 Languages differ in the sense of whether most elements of plural proper nouns are written in capital letters or only initial elements
 In German all types of nouns are written in capital letters
 angrezi main sabhi sangyaaon ko bade aksharon main likhane kii paripati prayog main thi, lekin 1800 ke qareeb yah samaapt ho gai
 In the US, many notable documents have recorded capitalization changes
 swatantraaa vidheyak kii ghoshnaa kaa ant or sampurna samvidhan main sabhi sangyaaen bade aksharon main likhaa dikhataa he, adhikaar vidheyak main kuch jativaachak sangyaaen bade aksharon main likhaa gaya he, lekin adhikansh nahin or terahavaan sanvaidhanik sanshodhan main keval vyaktivaachak sangyaaon ko bade aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 Sometimes the same word can act as both a proper noun and a proper noun depending on the context
 is siddhant ke do rupabhed dikhalaae ja sakate hai, haalanki donon prakaar ke udaahranon ke ullekh hetu vaastavik-jagat ke labalon ke prayog dwaara yah bhed dhundhala ho gaya he
 There are no universally agreed names, but "capitanim" and "specific Designator" are somewhat in vogue
 capitonim ek aisa shabd he joki bade aksharon main likhe jane par uske arth main parivartan karata he
 It is a type of synonym
 kabhi-kabhi bade akshar vaale roopantaran kaa arth, chote akshar vaale roopantaran ke arth se vishesh maamla ho saktaa he, yaa vah aadhaar-naam se judaa ho saktaa he
 for example: aise kai shabd hai joki aam taur par jativaachak sangyaaen hai lekin jo sugamawa se "asthaayee taur par vyaktivaachak sangya kaa kaary nibhaa sakate hai" 
 kuch udhaaharan hai agency, avenue, boulevard, box, building, bureau, case, chapter, city, class, college, day, edition, floor, grade, group, hospital, level, office, page, paragraph, part, phase, road, school, stage, step, street, type, university, week
 asthaayee vyaktivaachak sangya kaa kaary tab utpann hota he jab jativaachak sangya kisi sankhya yaa sankshepikaran ke vishisht ullekh hetu naam rachane ke liye koi anya shabd 
 ise tab "spacific decignator" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 for example: kyonki vartanee-vishyak vargeekaran main vibhinn aspasht sangyanatmak dhaanche hai, yah kinchit manamaana he, jiskaa taatpary he, log aise vibhinn arth laga sakate hai jinamein se koi bhi "galat" naa ho or aspashtataa kii vajah se ve apane bhinn dhaanchon ko sugamawa se ek duusare ko varnit nahin kar sakate hai
 However, readers dislike seeing large-letter differences, namely, inconsistencies
 isliye, anek prakaashak style guide kaa upyog karte hue framing ke susangat sanchaalan ko kutabaddh karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 For example, the Associated Press's A
P
 The stylebook uses the dictionary format and in many of his entries he provides guidance to AP journalists and editors on how aps can be used to intersect caste and subjective expressions
 Can implement the preferred logic in a consistent way
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab sangheey jaanch beuro kaa pehle ullekh kiya jaae, "bureau" ke liye bada akshar prayukt ho, kyonki yah spacific decignator kaa kaam kar rahaa he, yani, vah jativaachak sangya he "jo praasangik vyaktivaachak sangya kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 "however, later mentions, such as" the bureau announced


 ", will use the lowercase letter, as the word is used in the sense of its genitive noun
 yahi tark ocean shabd ke liye bhi lagu hota he
 A
P
 States, "ocean: the five, from the largest to the smallest: Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic Ocean, Arctic Ocean
 Lowercase ocean standing alone or in plural uses: the ocean, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
" AMA of the American Medical Association The Manual of Style, 10th Edition similarly guides its users
 udhaaharan ke liye, AMA kaa style he ki level yaa case yaa stage jaise shabdon ke liye bade akshar kaa prayog naa karen, bhale hi ve spacific-decignator kaa kaary kar rahe hon 
 The nature of capitonim and specific designators is often related: in both cases, the genitive and peculiar expressions of the word origin may be logically connected to each other
 kuch shabdon ko capitonim yaa spacific decignetteron ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, moolyankan vyaktiparak he
 for example: in capitonim / spacific decignator tatasth rahane waalon ko ekikrut karne vaala vishay he ki ve jativaachak se vyaktivaachak main badalane ke sandarbh main keval vishesh maamle nahin hai, balki bahut vishisht maamle hai, yani, kai udaahranon se ek adwitiya udhaaharan main
 iske alaava, khagoleey pindon ke maamalon main, yah spasht he ki koun-sa bhav pehle aayaa: vyaktivaachak bhav
 jab pehle pahal bhashaa viksit hui, is had tak ki maanav unke sandarbh ko samajhane lage, surya or chandramaa brahmadia anuthi vasteen thim
 As the human reference expanded, their new need for generic nouns for common type names was met by the retronym, with the most rational way of forming the generic noun using the same word with its broader sense
 vyaktivaachak sangya kaa gathan karne vaale shabd yaa shabdon ke saamaanya arth, jis vastu ko vyaktivaachak sangya sanderbhit kar rahaa ho usase asambandhit ho sakate hai
 For example, one can be named Tiger Smith despite not being tiger or smith
 yahi kaaran he ki aam taur par vyaktivaachak sangyaaon kaa bhashaaon ke bich anuwaad nahin hota he, haalanki unka lipyantaran ho saktaa he
 For example, the German surname Knödel in English does not become Knodel or Knoedel)
 However, transliteration of place names and names of kings, pope and non-contemporary writers is common and sometimes universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, portugali shabd Lisboa angrezi main Lisbon ho jaataa he; angrezi London french main Londres ho jaataa he or unani Ἁριστοτέλης Aristotelēs angrezi main Aristotle ho jaataa he
 Count nouns are genitive nouns that can take plurals, combine with numbers or quantifiers, and take the indefinite prefix
 gananeey sangyaaon ke udhaaharan hai chair, nose or occasion 
 Mass nouns are different from count nouns in that they cannot take plurals or connect with numerical words or quantifiers
 Examples from English include laughter, cutlery, helium, and furniture
 For example, it is not possible to mention one furniture or three furniture
 yah sach he bhale hi furniture main shaamil furniture ke khandon ko gina ja saktaa he
 Thus the distinction between mass and count nouns should not be made on the basis of what the noun refers to, but rather how the noun represents these elements
 Collective nouns ve sangyaaen hai jo ekvachan ke liye sangyaroop prastut karne ke baavjood, ek vyaktik yaa tatv se adhik samoohon ko sanderbhit karte hai
 Examples include committee, herd and school
 The grammatical properties of these nouns differ slightly from those of other nouns
 udhaaharan ke liye, jin sangya padabandhon ke ve vishay hai ekvachan ke liye sangyaroop kii prastuti ke baavjood, vidhey ke karta ke rup main kaam kar sakate hai
 a collective predicate is a predicate that cannot normally take the singular subject
 parvarti kaa ek udhaaharan he talked amongst themselves 
 Concrete nouns refer to physical elements that can be seen, at least in principle, by a sense
 Abstract nouns, on the other hand, refer to abstract things; That is, ideas or concepts
 While such differences are sometimes useful, the boundary between concrete and abstract is not always clear, for example, the noun art, which generally refers to the concept, but which in some contexts refer to specific artwork
 Can do 
 angrezi main, kai abstract nouns, visheshan yaa kriya main sangya banane vaale pratyayon ko jod kar banaae jate hai
 Examples are happiness, circulation and serenity
 sangya or sangya vaakyanshon ko aam taur par he, it, which or those jaise sarvnaam dwaara pratisthapit kar sakate hai, taaki doharaav yaa suspasht pahchaan ke parihaar, yaa anya kisi kaaran se
 udhaaharan ke liye, Janet thought that he was weird vaakya main shabd he sarvnaam he, jo prashnadhin vyakti ke naam kii jagah par maujuud he
 The English word can replace parts of one and noun phrases, it sometimes exists for a noun
 ek udhaaharan neeche diya gaya he: But one can also exist for large sub-parts of a noun phrase
 udhaaharan ke liye, nimnlikhit udhaaharan main, new car ke liye one maujuud ho saktaa he
 Many European languages, including beginning with Old Latin grammar, use some form of the accusative word as the basic word for a noun
 In dictionaries of such languages, the noun is replaced by s instead of n
 Or sb
 Is denoted by an abbreviation, which is used instead for proper nouns
 yah un vyakaranon ke anuroop he, jisamen sangyaaen or visheshan, udaahranarth angrezi shabd vidhey visheshan anukram bandhan kii tulana main, kai kshetron main ek duusare ke prati pravasthabaddh hote hai
 In French and Spanish, for example, adjectives often act like nouns where they refer to people with characteristics of adjectives
 is avadharana kaa sabase aam adhibhaasha naam he sangyaatmakataa 
 angrezi main ek udhaaharan he: Similarly, an adjective can also be used for an entire group or organization of people: isliye, ye shabd sattasuchak hai joki aam taur par angrezi main visheshan hai
 Type of noun sangya ke paanch prakaar hote hai: The word nominal also overlaps with meaning and usage with nouns and adjectives

 band kaa pehla album, epetic for distroction ko 21 july 1987 ko release kiya gaya
 The album went through an artwork change after Robert Williams' original cover design originated from the album
 The revised cover was a design by a tattoo artist named Bill White who actually designed it for a tattoo that Rose got last year

 america main, "welcome tu da jangal" ko iske pehle ekal ke rup main jari kiya gaya jiske saath ek sangeet video bhi shaamil tha
 Initially, the album and single lasted almost a year without a good performance, but when Jeffen Records founder David Jeffen was asked to support the band, he was personally obliged to convince MTV executives He went on to play "welcome to the Jungle" after his round-the-clock rotation
 Although the video was initially played only once on Sundays at 4 pm, it was noticed by rock and punk fans and soon the video and song were requested to be played simultaneously
 In Japan, live a full-fledged EP titled From the Jungle was released which included a selection of countless recordings from Markie Club as well as the album version of "sweet Child o 'mine"
 "sweet child o' mine" album kaa doosraa america ekal tha jiskaa sah-lekhan eksal rose dwaara unki apni premika or bhavi patni, arin evarli ke liye ek kavita ke rup main kiya gaya tha
 Due to the band's growing foundational success and the adverse gender urges of the tune, the song and its accompanying music video were heavily broadcast on both radio and MTV, and became a raging success in the summer of 1988 and topped the US charts
 Reached what Slash said in vh1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s, "it was actually the least loved song I've ever written
 

mujhe isse nafrat he, lekin yah hamaara ab tak kaa mahanatam geet ke rup main ubharta he"

 Guns and Roses began doing inaugural shows for major works, but as his fame began to grow, he made a world tour show in support of Appetite for Destruction
 The band toured all over the United States and in the spring of 1988 were invited to the famous Monsters of Rock Festival at Castle Donington in Leicestershire, England, where they collaborated with groups such as KISS and Iron Maiden
 At the start of the set of Guns and Roses, a crowd of over 100,000 with a capacity crowd started jumping and moving
 Despite Rose's requests that the crowd move away from the stage, two fans were crushed to death
 is traasadee ke liye media ne khaas taur par band ko doshi tehraaya or khabar di ki band ne khatarnaak bheed paristhitiyon main bhi bajaanaa jari rakhaa tha

 The song "one in a Million", which included the words "niggers" and "fagots" in addition to vulgar words, sparked controversy in which critics accused the band, and especially Axel Rose, of racism and homophobia
 Rose replied that the claims were baseless and specifically cited the example of slash, saying that she herself was half black
 unhone samajhaana jari rakhaa ki ye shabd pakshaposhak ke shabd, na ki vyaktigat vaktavy, the or saath main yah bhi kaha ki prageeton ne samaaj ke bheetar nasleey or pratikul samasyon ko protsaahit nahin kiya balki un par prakaash daalaa he

 Even after the release of GN'R Lies, Appetite for Destruction remained popular for the remainder of 1988 and 1989, resulting in a heavyweight metal artist and a favorite heavy metal album at the 1990 American Music Awards nationally telecast on Doordarshan
 Both titles were won, where Slash and mckagan appeared drunken and their iniquity aired
 The members eventually took steps to deal with their drug addiction after Rose threatened to end the band in the event they continued their excessive drug abuse
 While presenting the inaugural show for The Rolling Stones at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1989, he openly stated about this situation, particularly heroin addiction, if some of the band's special members "stopped dancing with Mr
 Brownstone"

 Use Your Illusion World Tour featured a guitar solo from Slash featuring the theme The Godfather, a piano-driven cover of Axel Rose of Black Sabbath's "it's Allright" and an extended crowd of classic rock-inspired "move to the City" Rose presented a collection of musicians gathered for the tour, included

 Although the band's previous drug and alcohol issues were under control, Axel was often agitated over loose security, sound problems, and unwanted filming or recording of performances
 unhone gaanon ke bich main raajnneetik bayaanbaji yaa sangeet aalochakon yaa celibrity pratidwandviyon ke khilaaf naaraazgi bhi jataai
 On July 2, 1991, just outside St
 Louis, he jumped into the audience during a performance of "rocket Queen" at the Riverport Amphitheater in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and grabbed a fan by a fan who was filming the event with a camera

 The result was that the artwork of Use Your Illusion contained a hidden message: "fuck you, St

 Metallica was forced to cancel the second hour of the show, but pledged to return to the city for another show
 After a long delay, during which the audience became very restless, Guns and Roses appeared on stage
 However, in the short time between the song-groups there was not enough tuning of the stage monitors, which resulted in the musicians not being able to hear their own voice
 iske alaava, rose ne bataaya ki unke gale main chot lagi he jisaki vajah se band ne bahut jald manch chhod diya

 The Gregorian calendar {gregorian calendar} is a calendar used almost everywhere in the world
 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries
 is naveen paddati ko italy, france, spain or portugal ne 1582 i0 main, prashia, germany ke roman catholic pradesh switzraland, holland or flanders ne 1583 i0 main, poland ne 1586 i0 main, hungary ne 1587 i0 main, germany or netherland ke protestant pradesh tathaa denmark ne 1700 i0 main, british samrajya ne 1752 i0 main, japan ne 1972 i0 main china ne 1912 i0 main, bulgaria ne 1915 i0 main, turki or soviet rus ne 1917 i0 main tathaa yugoslavia or romania ne 1919 i0 main apanaaya
 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 praani yaa jantu yaa jaanavar 'animelia' yaa metazoa jagat ke bahukoshikeey or sukendrik jeevon kaa ek mukhya samooh he
 After being born, as a creature grows up, its physical plan evolves as prescribed, although some animals go through life in the process of metamorphosis
 adhikansh jantu gatisheel hote hai, arthath apane aap or swatantra rup se gati kar sakate hai
 Most animals are also hostile, that is, they depend on other animals to live
 adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh 542 karod saal pehle cambrian visphot ke dauraan jeevashm record main samudri prajatiyon ke rup main prakat hue
 The word 'animal' comes from the Latin language Animaale, the Nutter of Animalis, and is derived from Anima, meaning living breath or spirit
 aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa main, is shabd kaa istemaal gaiyr-maanviya jaanwaron ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The biological definition of the term includes all members of the Kingdom Animalaya, including humans
 jantuon main kai vishesh gun hote hai jo unhen anya sajiv vastuon se alag karte hai
 Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular, separating them from bacteria and most protists
 ve parposhi hote hai, saamanytah ek aantarik kaksh main bhojan kaa pachan karte hai, yah lakshan unhen paudhon va shaiwal se alag banaata he, ve bhi paudhon, shaiwalon or kavakon se vibhedit kiye ja sakate hen kyonki unamem kathor koshika bhitti kaa abhaav hota he, sabhi jantu gatisheel hote hai, chaahe jivan kii kisi vishesh pravastha main hi kyon na hon
 In most animals, the embryo passes through a blastula stage, a differential property of animals
 kuch apwaadon ke saath, sabase khaskar spanj or placosoa, jantuon ke sharir alag-alag utakon main vibhedit hote hai
 These include muscles, which are able to control contraction and movement, and nerve tissues, which send and respond to signals
 saath hi inamen ek praroopik aantarik pachan kaksh hota he jo 1 yaa 2 chhidron se yukt hota he
 Animals that have this type of organization are called metazoans, or eumetazoans when the former is commonly used for animals
 sabhi jantuon main eukeriotic koshikaayen hoti hai, jo colejan or pratyasth glycoprotein se bane bahirkoshikeey metrics se ghiri hoti hai
 It can be calcified to form structures such as shell, bone and spines
 vikaas ke dauraan yah ek apekshaakrit lacheela dhaancha bana leti hai jis par koshikaayen gati kar sakati hai or sambhav jatil saranchanaaen banaate hue punah sangathit ho sakati hai
 In contrast, cells of other multicellular organisms such as plants and fungi are surrounded by cell walls and thus develop by progressive growth
 iske alaava, jantuon kii koshikaon kaa ek adwitiya gun he antar koshikeey sandhiyaan: tite jankshan, gap jankshan or desmosome
 Almost all animals undergo some type of sexual reproduction process: polyploidy
 in main kuch vishesh prajnan koshikaayen hai jo chote gatisheel shukranujan yaa bade gatiheen andj ke utpaadan hetu ardhsutri vibhaajan karti hai
 They converge to form zygotes, which develop into new organisms
 kai jantuon main alangik prajnan kii kshamta bhi hoti he
 This can occur through anesthesia, where the egg develops into the embryo without fertilization, in some cases by fragmentation
 yugmanaj shuru main blastula naamak ek khokhale gole main viksit hota he, yah koshikaon kii punarvyavastha tathaa vibhedan kii prakriya se hokar gujarata he
 In the sponge, the blastula larva swims to a new location and develops into a new sponge
 adhikansh anya samoohon main, blastula main adhik jatil punarvyavastha kii prakriya hoti he
 It first intercalates to form a gastrula, which consists of a digestive chamber and two separate germ levels — an outer ectoderm and an internal endoderm

 Hunters may or may not kill their prey before eating, but the process of hunting always results in the death of the prey
 upbhog kii ek anya mukhya shrenee he mritposhan, mrit carbonic padaarth kaa upbhog
 It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between these two types of food behavior, for example, a parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay its eggs on it, so that their offspring receive food from its decomposing organic material

 ek duusare par lagaaye gaye chaynit dabaav ne shikaar or shikari ke bich vikasvaadi daud ko janm diya he, jiske parinamswaroop kai shikari virdohi anukulan viksit hue hai
 Most animals receive energy indirectly from sunlight
 paudhe prakaash sanshleshan naamak ek prakriya ke dwaara is urja kaa prayog karke surya ke prakaash ko saadhaaran sharkara ke anu main parivartit kar dete hai
 The process of photosynthesis begins with carbon dioxide and water, converting sunlight energy into chemical energy, which accumulates in the bonds of glucose, releasing oxygen during the process
 ab is sharkara kaa upyog nirmaan ikaayiyon ke rup main hota he, jisase paudhe main vruddhi hoti he
 When animals eat these plants, the sugars produced by the plants are used by animals
 yah yaa to jantu ke pratyaksh vikaas main sahaayak hoti he yaa apaghatit ho jaati he or sangrahit saura urja chhorati he or is prakaar se jantu ko gati ke liye aavashyak urja kii prapti hoti he
 This process is known as glycolysis
 jantu jo jal ushma nikaas ke kareeb yaa samudri tal par thande risaav ke najadik rahete hai, ve surya kii urja par nirbhar nahin hai
 Instead, synthesized organisms and bacteria form the basis of the food chain
 ] There is a general belief that animals have evolved from a flagellate eukaryote
 unke nikatatam gyaat sajiv sambandhi hai koeno kashabhiki, colerd kashabhiki jinaki aakaariki vishisht spanjon ke koeno cites ke saamaan he
 Molecular studies place animals in a superfamily group, called opisthokonts, which also include animals from the koeno flagellum, fungi and some small parasitic protists
 pehle jeevashm jo jantuon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, lagbhag 610 million varsh purv, purvacambrian kaal ke ant main prakat hue or ye adiakaran yaa vendian biota kehalaate hai
 But these are difficult to relate to later fossils
 Some may represent the predecessors of modern associations, but they may be distinct groups, and it is also possible that they are not actually animals
 unhen chhod kar, adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh, 542 million varsh purv, cambrian yug ke dauraan, swatah hi prakat hue
 It is still disputed whether this phenomenon, called the Cambrian explosion, represents a sharp divergence between different groups or the changes in conditions that made fossilization possible
 haalaanki kuch puratatvigyaani or bhuvaigyanik bataate hai ki jantu pehle soche jane vaale samay se kaaphi pehle prakat hue, sambhawatah 1 billian varsh purv
tonian yug main paae gaye jeevashm chinh jaise maarg or bill, tristareey krimiyon jaise metazoa kii upasthiti ko suchit karte hai, ye sambhawatah kentue kii tarah bade or jatil rahe honge 
 Also at the beginning of the Tonian era, stromatolite decreased about 1 billion years ago
 vividhta jo is samay stromatolait ke rup main charne vaale pashuon ke aagaman ko suchit karti he, ne ordovisian or parmian ke ant ke kuch hi samay baad, vividhta main vruddhi kii, jisase badi sankhya main charne vaale samudri jantu lupt ho gaye, unki jansankhya main punah prapti ke kuch hi samay baad unki sankhya main kami aa gayi
 The discovery, which is very similar to these early fossil marks, has its origins in the present-day giant size single-organism Protista organism Gromia sphaerica, doubting their interpretation as evidence of early animal development
 lambey arase pehle se spanj ko anya praarambhik jantuon se bhinn mana jaataa tha
 As noted above, the complex organization found in most other associations is not found in them, their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into separate tissues
 spanj tane rahit hote hai or aam taur par inke chhidron ke madhyam se jal khinch kar bhojan praapt karte hai
 Archaeocyatha, which have a fused skeleton, may represent a sponge or a different association
 haalaanki, 2008 main 21 vanshon main 150 jeenon kaa ek faillo jinomik adhyayan bataata he ki yah tinophora yaa comb jelly he jo kam se kam un 21 sanghon main jantuo kaa aadhaar banaati he
 The authors believe that sponges — or at least the sponges they have discovered — are not so primitive, but can instead be simplified secondary
 anya sangho main, tinophora or nideria, jinamein samudri anemon, coral or jelifish shaamil hai, trigyat samamit hote hai, inamen ek hi chhidr se yukt pachan kaksh hota he, jo mukh or guda donon kaa kaam karata he
 Both have distinctly differentiated tissues, but are not organized into organs
 inamen keval do mukhya janan str hote hai, bahya tvak str or antah tvak str, jinke bich main keval koshikaayen bikhri hoti hai
 That is why these animals are sometimes called diploblastic
 chote placosoa samaan hai, lekin un main ek sthaayee pachan kaksh nahin hota he
 The remaining animals form a federal group called the bilateria
 adhiktam bhaag ke liye, ve dwiparshv samamit hote hai or aksar ek vishishtikrut sir hota he jo khaadya angon or samvedi angon se yukt hota he
 The body is tripleblastic, that is, all three reproductive layers are fully developed and tissues form differentiated organs
 pachan kaksh main do chhidr hote hai, ek mukh or ek guda, saath hi ek aantarik deh guha bhi hoti he jo ceylom yaa abhaasi deh guha bhi kehalaati he
 There are exceptions to each of these traits, however - adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and have very simplified physiological structures in typical parasitic animals
 anuvanshik adhyayan nen bailetria ke bheetar sambandh ko lekar hamaare gyaan ko kaaphi had tak badal diya he
 Most belong to two main genealogies: Deuterostomes and Protostomes, including Ecdysozoa, Platyzoa, and Lophotrochozoa
 is ke atirikt, dwiparshvasamamit jeevon ke kuch chote samooh hai jo in mukhya samoohon ke samaksh visarit hote hue prathit hote hai
 These include Aesolomorpha, Rhombozoa and Orthonectida
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mixojoa, ek koshikeey paraseete jinhen mul rup se protogon mana jaataa tha, bailetria se hi viksit hue hai
 Deuterostomes differ in many ways from other bilateria, protostomes
 donon hi maamalon main ek puraa pachan path paaya jaataa he
 However, in the protostome, the initial pore develops in the mouth and the anus develops separately
 duterostome main yah ulat he
 In most protostomes, cells normally fill in the inner part of the gastrula and form the middle reproductive level, this is called Schizosillus development, but in the deuterostome it is formed by the intracellular level of innervation, known as entrosylic pouching
 duterostome main adhar ke bajaay prishthiya tantrika rajju hota he or unke bhrun main bhinn prakaar kaa vidalan hota he
 All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are distinctly federal levels
 duterostome ke pramukh sangh hai, ekainodermanta or cordeta
 The former is radially symmetric and is particularly marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers
 duusare vaale main mukhya rup se kasheruki jeev hai jinamein ridh kii haddi pai jaati he
 These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
 inke atirikt duterostome main hemicordeta or ekon krimi bhi shaamil hai
 Although they are not currently found predominantly, significant fossil evidence relates to them
 chetognetha yaa tir krimi bhi duterostome ho sakate hai, lekin adhik haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan protostome ke saath inke saannnidhya ko darshaate hai
 Ecdysozoa are protostomes, which have been named on the basis of a characteristic characteristic of growth by moulting or release
 sabase bada jantu sangh, aarthropoda inase sambandh rakhata he, jisamen krimi, makadiyaan, kekade or unke nikat sambandhi shaamil hai
 The body is divided into segments and typically there are paired appendages
 do chote sangh onicofora or taradegrada, aarthropoda ke nikat sambandhi hai or inamen bhi unke samaan lakshan paae jate hai
 The nematoda or round worm comes in Ekadisozoa, the second largest animal association
 golkrimi aam taur par sookshm jeev hote hai or lagbhag har aise vaataavaran main utpann ho jate hai jahaan pani hota he
 There are many important parasites
 in se sambandhit chote sangh hai nimetamorpha yaa ashwarom krimi or kinorehinka, priyapulida or loriciphera
 These groups have a truncated body, which is called virtual body cavity
 protostome ke shesh do samooh kabhi kabhi spirila ke saath rakhe jate hai, kyonki donon main bhrun kaa vikaas sarpil vidalan se hota he
 Platyzoa include the association Platyhelminthes, the flattened worm
 mul rup se inhen sabase aadim prakaar ke dwiparshvi mana jaataa tha, lekin ab aisa mana jaataa he ki ve adhik jatil purvajon se viksit hue hai
 This group includes many parasites, such as the fluke and the lace worm
 chapate krimi aguhiy hote hai, inamen deh guha kaa abhaav hota he, jaisaa ki unke nikatatam sambandhi, sookshm jeev gestrotrica main hota he
 Other associations of Platyzoa consist mostly of microscopic and virtual celiac
 sabase pramukh hai rotiphera yaa rotiphers, jo jaleey vaataavaran main saamaanya hai
 These include Acanthocyphaella or sculp-topped worms, Gnathostomulida, Microbenthozoa, and possibly Cyclophora
 in samoohon main jatil jabade hote hai, jinaki vajah se ye gnethiphera kehalaate hai
 Both groups have long been thought to be closely related, as tricophore larvae are found in both, but Annelida was thought to be much closer to Arthropoda
 kyonki ve donon hi khandit hote hai
 It is generally considered convergent evolution, as there are many morphological and genetic differences between the two associations
 lophotrocojoa main nimertia yaa ribbon krimi, sipunkula bhi shaamil hai or kai sangh jinamein mukh ke chaaron ore pakshmabhika kaa ek pankhaa hota he, lofophor kehalaate hai
 These were traditionally grouped with Lofo forites
 lekin ab aisa prathit hota he ki ve peraphilatic hai, kuch nimertia ke najdiki hai ore kuch molska va enelida ke najdiki hai
 These include Brachiopoda or Lemp shells, which are prominent in fossil records, Entroprocata, Phoronida, and possibly Bryozoa or Moss fauna
 jantu main paayi jane vaali baari vividhta ke kaaran, vaigyanikon ke liye chaynit prajatiyon kii ek choti sankhya ko adhyayan karnaa adhik kifayati hota he, taaki is vishay par unke kaaryon ore nishkarshon se sambandh sthapit kiya ja sake ki jantu saamaanya rup se kis prakaar se kaary karte hai
 Because they are easy to keep and hybridize, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the nematode Canorhabditis elegans have long been widely studied specimen organisms and were among the first life forms to be genetically sequenced
 ise unke jinom kii bahut adhik apachayit avasthaa ke dwaara sahaj banaaya gaya, lekin yahan do dhar kii talwaar kai jino, introns or linkage lost ke saath he, ye ekadsojoa ke jeev saamaanya rup se jantuon kii utpatti ke bare main hamen thoda bahut sikhaa sakate hai
 The extent of this type of evolution within the ultimate association will be revealed through the genome project of Crustaceans, Annelids, and Mollusca, which is currently progressing
 starlet samudri anemon jinom ke vishleshan ne spanjon, placosoa or koenokashabhikiyon ke mahatva par jor daalaa he
 And they are also being sequenced in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to Eumetazoa
 homosclaromorf spanj oskarela karmela kaa vishleshan bataata he ki spanj ke antim saamaanya purvaj or eumetazoa ke jantu purv kalpana se adhik jatil the
 Other modal organisms related to the animal world include the rat and zebrafish
 arastu ne sajiv duniya ko paudhon or jantuon main vibhajit kiya or iske baad kerolas linius ne pehla padanukramit vargeekaran kiya
 Since then, biologists have been emphasizing on the relationship of development and hence these groups have become somewhat restricted
 udhaaharan ke liye, sookshmdarsheey protojoa ko mul rup se jantu mana gaya kyonki ve gati karte hai, lekin ab unhen alag rakhaa jaataa he
 In the original plan of Linnaeus, animals were one of the three worlds, divided into classes of vermis, insecta, piesies, amphibia, avies, and memelia
 tab se aakhri ke chaar virgon ko ek hi sangh cordeta main rakhaa jaataa he, jabaki kai anya roopon ko alag kar diya gaya he
 The above list represents our current knowledge or understanding of the group, although there is some diversity in different sources

 It looks like a three-dimensional image or a trimb, but it is basically a two-dimensional shape
 iske liye jab do dwiaiami akritiyon ko ek duusare ke upar rakhaa jaataa jaataa he
 In technical language it is called superimposition
 yah maanav aankh ko gaharaai kaa bhram bhi detaa he
 The creation of holograms requires the recording of fine details, so it is made through laser light
 lager kirane ek vishesh tarangadairghy kii hoti hai
 Because holograms are seen in normal light, laser rays with these special wavelengths make the hologram bright
 hologram par chitra praapt karne ke liye do alag alag tarangadairghy vaali lager kirnon ko ek photographic plate par ankit kiya jaataa he
 Before this, both laser rays pass through a beam spreader, causing the light of the laser rays on the plate to be like a flashlight and imprint the image
 isse ek hi jagah do chhaviyaan praapt hoti hai
 That is , through laser light on the same base , two different shapes are inscribed in such a way that different shapes are seen when the viewer views the hologram from different angles
 maanav aankh dwaara jab hologram ko dekha jaataa he to vah donon chhaviyon ko milakar mastishk main sanket bhejti hai, jisase mastishk ko uske triayami hone kaa bhram hota he
 When the hologram is ready, it is printed on silver plates
 ye chaandi kii parten diflacted prakaash se banaai jaati hai

 By the end of 2006, India destroyed more than 75 percent of its chemical weapons stockpile and by April 2009 was granted an extension to destroy the remaining stock and was expected to destroy 100 percent of the stock within that time frame 
 bharat ne may 2009 main sanyukt raashtra ko suchit kiya he ki isane antarrashtriya rasinic hathiyaar kanvension ke anupaalan main rasinic hathiyaaron ke apane bhandar ko nasht kar diya tha
 India has become the third such country after South Korea and Albania to do so
 sanyukt raashtra ke nirikshakon dwaara is par cross-jaanch bhi kii gai thi
 India has an advanced commercial chemical industry that produces its own chemicals in bulk for domestic consumption
 yah bhi vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya gaya he ki bharat ke paas ek vyapak asainik rasayan or dawa udyog he or salanaa britain, sanyukt rajya america or taiwan jaise deshon ke liye rasayanon kaa kaaphi maatra main niryaat karata he
 Before 26 June 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru, soon to be India's first Prime Minister, announced: bharat kaa parmaanu kaarykram march 1944 ko shuru kiya gaya or praudyogiki ke kshetra main apane teen charan ke prayaason ko dow homi bhabha dwaara sthapit kiye gaya
 When he established the Center for Atomic Research, the Basic Research Institute
 bharat ne oktober 1962 main ek sankshipt himalay seemaa yuddh main china se apana kshetra kho diya
 Fearing potential Chinese invasion, New Delhi government provided impetus for the development of nuclear weapons
 bharat ne pehali baar 1974 main ek parmaanu upkaran kaa pareekshan kiya
 Called a peaceful nuclear explosion
 pareekshan main istemaal kiya gaya plutonium canada ke sirus riector main utpaadit kiya gaya tha or yah hi parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh kii shuruyaat kii vajah bana
 India again conducted a nuclear test in 1998
 1998 main pareekshan jari rakhane ke pratikriya ke rup main, sanyukt rajya america or japan ne bharat par pratibandh lagaaya
 Which was later removed
 dow aar chidambaram jinhone bharat ke pokharan 2 parmaanu pareekshanon kaa netritv kiya ne press trust of india ko die ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki bharat neutron bam ke utpaadan main sakasham he
 India has announced a nuclear no-use policy and has developed a "credible minimum deterrence capability" on this nuclear doctrine
 agast 1999 main bharat sarkaar ne ek masauda prastut kiya jisamen daawa kiya gaya ki bharat ke parmaanu hathiyaar keval bachaav ke liye hai or inkaa prayog keval pratishodh ke liye kiya jaayegaa
 The document states that India will not launch a nuclear strike first, but if the defense fails it will be used only for retaliation and the use of nuclear weapons will be decided by the Prime Minister or his' designated successor
 enardisi ke anusaar, 2001-2002 main bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav kii vruddhi ke baavjood bharat apni parmaanu no-first niti ke liye patibaddh he
 Land-based India's nuclear weapons are under the control of the Indian Army
 isamen vartmaan main belistic mixilon ke teen alag-alag prakaar hai, agni-1, agni-2, agni 3 or prithvi missile parivaar kaa sena kaa sanskaran - prithvi 1
 Additional variants of the Agni missile series, most recently Agni-4 and Agni-5, are currently being developed which will enter full operational service in the near future
 agni -4 ko sashastr balon main shaamil kiya gaya he or agni 5 ko 2016 ke pareekshanon main 4 safaltaapurvak launch kiya ja chukaa he
 The range of Agni-4 is 4000 km and Agni-5 is 5500-6000 km
 agni 6 kaa vikaas kiya ja rahaa he isaki prastaavit range 8000-12,000 kimi he isamen multiple independent targeteble rientry wheekals or manyuverbal rientry whical ke rup main anek suvidhaon kii kalpana kii gayi he
 Pakistan has strongly opposed this success of India
 china va pakistan kaa maananaa he ki bharat aisi takanic se america or europe ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 According to the Pakistani diplomat, India wants to see itself as a super power which is a threat to China as well as the US and its allies
 haalanki america, bharat ko china ke baraabar khadaa karnaa chahta he
 The current status of India's air-based nuclear weapons is unclear
 unki jameen hamale main bhoomika ke alaava, haalanki, yah mana jaataa he ki dasolt miraj -2000 or bhartiya vayusena ke SEPECAT jaguaar ek madhyamik parmaanu strike bhoomika pradaan karne main sakasham hai
 The SEPECAT Jaguar was designed to carry nuclear weapons and the Indian Air Force has identified the jet as being capable of delivering Indian nuclear weapons
 bhartiya nausena ne parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa vitaran karne ke liye do samudr aadhaarit pranali viksit kii hai
 Which will fulfill Indian ambitions for nuclear distribution
 jise 2015 main tainaat kiye jane kii sambhaavna thi
 The first is a submarine-based launch system with at least four 6,000-tonne submarines and ballistic missiles of the nuclear-powered Arihant class
 pehali pandubbi ienes arihant samudri pareekshanon ko puraa karne ke baad parichaalan hetu kamishan kii gai
 It is the first nuclear powered submarine made by India
 siie kii report main daawa kiya gaya he ki rus ke nausaina ne parmaanu pranodan kaarykram ke liye takneekee sahaayta pradaan kii he
 The submarines will be equipped with 12 Sagarika missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons
 bharat ke diardio ne agni 3 missile ke ek pandubbi laanch belistic missile sanskaran par bhi kaam shuru kar diya he
 Which is known as Agni 3SL
 bhartiya raksha sutron ke anusaar, agni 3 esel kii seemaa 3,500 kilometre he
 The new missile will meet the shortage of older and less capable submarine launch Sagarika ballistic missiles
 haalanki, arihant varg kii pandubbiyaan adhiktam keval chaar agni 3 esel belistic missile le jane main sakasham hogi
 The second ship launch system is the short-range Dhanush ballistic missile based system
 isaki seemaa lagbhag 300 kilometre kii he
 The missile was tested from INS Subhadra in the year 2000
 ienes subhadra ko pareekshan ke liye sanshodhit kiya gaya tha or missile ko riinforced helicopter deck se laanch kiya gaya tha
 Due to which it was considered partially successful
 2004 main, missile ko phir se ienes subhadra se test kiya gaya or is baar parinaam safal rahaa tha
 The missile was tested again in December 2005, but this time it was from the destroyer INS Rajput
 pareekshan bhoomi aadhaarit lakshya se takaraane ke saath yah safal ghoshit hua tha
 India has neither signed the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty nor the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty but accepted the Partial Test Ban Treaty in October 1963
 bharat antarrashtriya parmaanu urja agency kaa sadsy he or apane 17 parmaanu riektaron main se chaar ieie ke suraksha upayon ke adheen kar diye hai
 India announced its refusal to accept the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty in 1997 by voting against the para of a UN General Assembly resolution
 jo jald se jald sambhav sabhi gaiyr hastakshar deshon ko is sandhi ko sweekaar karne ke liye dabaab daalati
 India also voted against the United Nations General Assembly Resolution CTBT
 jo 10 sitambar 1996 ko apanaaya gaya tha
 India has also objected to the lack of provision for universal nuclear disarmament
 bharat ne yah bhi maang kii he ki sandhi prayogshaala simulation ko bhi pratibandhit kare
 In addition, India opposed the provision of Article 14 of the Treaty of CTBT
 bharat ne iske liye tark diya he ki kya kisi desh ko apane samprabhu adhikaar kaa ulanghan karwaakar is sandhi par hastakshar karavaaya jaayegaa
 Soon in February 1997, Foreign Minister Indra Kumar Gujral reiterated India's opposition to the treaty, stating that "india is in favor of any move aimed at destroying nuclear weapons, but believes that the treaty in its current form is comprehensive No and only certain types of tests are banned
 " In August 2008, the International Atomic Energy Agency approved the Safety Standards Agreement with India
 jiske tahat dhire-dhire bharat ke asainik parmaanu riektaron ke liye pahunch praapt hogi
 In September 2008, the Nuclear Suppliers Group allowed India to use civil nuclear technology and fuels from other countries
 is chhot ke baad bharat ab ek aisa desh he jisane bina parmaanu aprasar sandhi par hastakshar kiye yah chhot hasil kii he
 But still India is not allowed for nuclear trade with the rest of the world
 enesji chhot ke karyanvayan ke baad se, bharat ne france, sanyukt rajya america, mongolia, namibia, kazakstan or australia sahit kai deshon ke saath parmaanu saude par hastakshar kiye hai
 While a framework for similar deals with Canada and the UK is also being prepared

 kennedy prashasan ko bahut hi kam ummid thi ki kremlin unki maangon ko maan legaa or vah ek sainya takaraav kii apeksha kar rahaa tha
 On the other hand, Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union wrote in a letter to Kennedy that "the action of his quarantine" of international waterways and skyway traffic is an aggression that will put mankind in the inferno of the world nuclear-missile war

 In its memoirs published in 1970, Khrushchev wrote, "in addition to protecting Cuba, our missiles will begin to equalize what the West has to balance with power
 Where does " Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev had the idea of responding to the development and deployment of strategic United States missiles in May 1962 by deploying his mid-range nuclear missiles in Cuba

 " With these missiles, the Soviet Union virtually took the entire continental United States under its effective target
 chalis laancharon kaa yojit shastraagaar tha
 The Cuban population immediately noted the arrival and deployment of the missiles, and hundreds of reports reached Miami
 The US Intelligence Department received numerous reports, many of them suspicious or ridiculous, and most of them could be dismissed as defensive missiles

 Those reports described night-long transport of very tall canvas-covered cylinders from cities via trucks, which could not be diverted to cities without help and tact

 The US had no plans in fact, because the US intelligence department was confident that the Soviet Union would never deploy a nuclear missile in Cuba
 Exom quickly discussed five possible action sequences: sanyukt chinas of staff ne sarvasammati se sahmati vyakt kii ki ek purna-paimaane par hamalaa or hastkshep hi ekmaatr samaadhaan he
 They believed that the Soviet Union would not attempt to stop the US from conquering Cuba
 kennedy uljhan main the
 They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something
 They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing
 If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin
 kennedy ne sochaa ki cuba par hawaii hamalaa karne se soviet yah maan lenge ki berlin ko adheen karne ke liye "ek hari jhandi" kaa signal mil gaya he
 Kennedy also believed that US allies would think that Berlin lost the US as a "war-loving cowboy" because of not finding a peaceful solution to the Cuban situation
 :332 Exom then discussed the strategic balance of power, the impact on both political and military
 sanyukt chinas of staff kaa maananaa tha ki mixilon se sainya santulan gambhir rup se badal jayega, lekin raksha sachiv robert mkanmara ne isse asahmati jataayi

the military balance had not changed

 sabase pehle, kennedy ne sankat se ek maah pehle america janata se spasht vaada kiya tha ki "agar america ke khilaaf aakraamak karrwai karne laayak kshamta se sampann hota he
 

 Then America Will Take Action, ": 674-681 Second, would damage the us's credibility between its allies and the American public if they allowed the Soviet Union to change the strategic balance by deploying missiles in Cuba

 Since it was scheduled to take place in international waters, President Kennedy received approval from the OAS to take military action under the hemispheric defense provisions of the Rio Treaty
 Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the U
S
 Commander South Atlantic at Trinidad on 9 November
 An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required
 In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers and one submarine had reported to COMSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2
 The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the quarantine
 The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship
 Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the U
S
 to discuss this assistance
 The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the quarantine operation
 This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty
 Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport
 The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba
 The cno's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the quarantine

 On October 22, Monday evening at 7:00 pm EST, President Kennedy gave a nationwide television speech broadcast by all major networks, announcing the discovery of the missiles
 It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union
 Kennedy described the administration's plan: To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated
 All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation and port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back
 This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers
 We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948
 During the speech, instructions for US forces around the world to be placed at DEFCON 3 were issued

 However, after this, at 9:24 pm, a wire sent by Khrushchev was received by Kennedy at 10:52 pm EST, in which Khrushchev said, "if you look at the evolving situation with impunity, you will understand with a cool mind
 That the Soviet Union would not shy away from rejecting America's arbitrary demands, "and that the Soviet Union views the blockade as" an attack action "and instructed its ships to ignore it Ayenge

 On 25 October Thursday morning at 1:45 EST, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by saying that the US had been forced into action, constantly assuring us that there were no offensive weapons in Cuba
 And when these assurances proved to be wrong, then the reactions against the deployment "became necessary which i have announced

 Robert Kennedy called it "a very long and emotional letter"
 Khrushchev reiterated the basic framework, which John Scalley had been told the day before, "I propose: on our part we will declare that there will be no weapons in our ships for Cuba
 You will declare that The United States will not attack Cuba and will not support any other forces that intend to attack Cuba

 Contrary to last night's letter, a new proposal was made in this message that if the Jupiter missiles were removed from Italy and Turkey, the missiles would be withdrawn from Cuba in return
 At 10:00 am EST, the Executive Committee met again to discuss the situation and concluded that the message changed after internal arguments between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin

 will remove its analogous means from Turkey

 Kennedy had already stated that he would order an attack on those sites if an attack occurred, but decided that he would not do so until a second attack
 40 saalon ke baad mecnaimara ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha: We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational
 We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that — the Cubans did not have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did — we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air -missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict
 And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we would not meet, we'd simply attack
 It was shot down on Friday
 Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought "well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack
" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation

 White House special counsel and advisors Ted Sorrensen and Robert Kennedy went to the meeting and returned 45 minutes later with the effect of a draft letter
 The President had made several changes, typed and sent it
 exom kii baithak ke baad, ovel karyaalay main ek or choti baithak jari rahi
 The team argued that the letter given to Ambassador Dobranin should be outlined with a verbal message saying that if missiles were not lifted, military action would be taken to remove them
 Dean Rusk added a provision that Turkish language would not be mentioned anywhere in the language of the agreement, but there would be an agreement that the missiles would be "voluntarily" removed immediately thereafter
 The President agreed to this and the message was sent
 juon brito kii guzarish par fomin or scally phir se mili
 Scali asked why Khrushchev's two letters were so different, so Fomin claimed that it might have happened because of "poor communication"
 scally ne jawaab diya ki yah daawa vishwasaneey nahin or ve chillaaye ki unhen sochaa ki yah "ek bekaar dhokhaa tha"

 Scally said he did not think anyone would believe it, but they agreed to give the message

 Within the US establishment, it was well understood that Khrushchev was in a terrible situation, ignoring the second proposal and accepting the first

 Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood, saying, "we did not give up hope, but what could be expected now when Khrushchev revisited his position in the next few hours
" yah ek ummid thi, na ki apeksha
 mangalvaar yaa sambhavat: kal tak sainya sangharsh kii apeksha thi
 

 " raat 8:05 iesti ek patr agle din die jane ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya
 The message was like, "as i read your letter, the main points of your proposal - as much as i could understand them, seem to be acceptable - which are the following: 1) You can get these weapons systems from Cuba to the UN proper supervision

 In the context of Cuba the Security Council Under the framework, the US would make a statement that goes like this: It would be announced that the United States would respect the inviolability of Cuba's borders, its sovereignty

 The practical effect of this kennedy-khrushchev treaty was that it effectively strengthened Castro's position in Cuba, while also ensuring that the US would not invade Cuba

 kaary, bhautikee kii sabase mahatvapurn raashiyon main se ek he
 The working rate is called power
 kaary karne yaa karaane se vastuon kii urja main parivartan hota he
 The work done if the object is displaced d distance in the direction of force by applying f force on an object hoga
 Example: 10 Newton's force is applied on an object in the south direction and if that object is displaced 2 m in the south direction, then the work done by the force is w = = 20 n m = 20 J
 kisi vastu par 5 newton kaa bal lagaakar use 4 meter visthapit karne par bhi 20 j hi kaary hoga 
 The unit of work is 'joule'
 ise sankshep main j se nirupit kiya jaataa he
 1 joule = 1 newton-meter
 kaary ek adish raashi he
 If a fixed force is applied on an object and it moves in a straight line, the work done can be extracted from the following formula- jahaan: But if the value of the force is not fixed and the displacement is not in one direction but in different directions, then in this case the vector product of force and displacement have to be integrated to extract the work volume

 churaaye gayi rupayon se unhone upanyaas aadi kharidkar padhanaa prarambh kar diya evam cigarette pine va bhang chadhaane kii aadat bhi pad gayi thi
 Overall, the trend of money-theft continued and Ramprasad was now used to reading books of novels and ghazals filled with Urdu premiers
 sanyog se ek din bhang ke nashe main hone ke kaaran ramprasad ko chori karte hue pakad liya gaya
 Plenty of beating, novels and other books were torn but the habit of stealing money was not lost
 aage chalakar jab unako thodi samaj aayi tabhi ve is durgun se mukt ho sake
 Ramprasad started studying English when he did not pass the Urdu Middle examination

 Due to the teachings of the priest, Ramprasad began to practice celibacy with the recitation

 All the misgivings and bad habits of adolescence were in mind

 The body had become handsome and robust

 During this time he got in touch with Munshi Indrajit who came to the temple
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko arya samaaj ke sambandh main bataaya or swami dayanand saraswati kii likhi pustak satyarth prakaash padhane ko di
 The serious study of Satyarth Prakash had a surprising impact on Ramprasad's life
 ramprasad jab government skool shahjahanpur main aathvin kaksha ke chaatr the tabhi sanyog se swami somdev kaa arya samaaj bhawan main aagaman hua
 Munshi Indrajit appointed Ramprasad to Swamiji's service
 yaheen se unke jivan kii dasha or disha donon main parivartan prarambh hua
 a serious study of Satyarth Prakash on the one hand and an open discussion on political subjects with Swami Somdev on the other hand aroused the feeling of patriotism in his mind

 He has mentioned this in his autobiography

 Now this book has been edited and compiled in part-three of Sarfaroshi's book titled Tamanna and can be seen in many other libraries including Teen Murti Bhawan Library, New Delhi

 He formed an organization under the guidance of Pandit Gandalal Dixit under the name Matriwadi

 In order to collect funds for the party, Ramprasad, who had become famous as 'bismil' till now, also committed two robberies in June 1918 and one in September 1918, making the police alert of these youths
 There were raids all over the place in search
 26 se 31 disambar 1918 tak dilli main laal kile ke saamne hue congress adhiveshan main is sanghathan ke navayuvakon ne chilla-chilla kar jaise hi pustaken bechnaa shuru kiya ki police ne chapa daalaa kintu bismil kii sujh boojh se sabhi pustaken batch gayin

 Some of his teammates went to Shahjahanpur and spread the rumor that Bhai Ramprasad was killed by a police bullet while the truth was that he jumped in the Yamuna during the police encounter and floated miles inside the water with the power of yoga practice
 Going far ahead, came out of the river and where the Greater Noida is inhabited nowadays, the uninhabited people went to the ravines
 vahaan un dinon keval babul ke hi vriksh hua karte the; or oosar jameen main aadmi to kahin dur-dur tak dikhataa hi nahin tha
 Ram Prasad Bismil took refuge in Rampur Jagir, a small village here and roamed in the uninhabited forests for several months, grazing the cow buffalo of the village goose
 iskaa bada hi rochak varnan unhone apni aatmakatha ke dwitiya khand : swadesh prem main kiya he
 While living here, he wrote his revolutionary novel, The Action of the Bolsheviks

 At present, since this village comes under the Beta Forest Sector of Greater Noida, the Government of Uttar Pradesh has developed the immortal Shaheed Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan in the memory of the Forest Department's reserved land in the area of rampur Jagir village
 Which is supervised by the Forest Department of the state with the funding of Greater Noida Administration
 'bismil' kii ek visheshta yah bhi thi ki ve kisi bhi sthaan par adhik dinon tak thaharte nahin the
 Staying at Rampur Jagir for a few days, he also stayed in Kosma District Mainpuri, the village of his real sister Shastri Devi
 maje kii baat yah ki unki apni bahan tak unhen pahchaan nahin paayin
 Walked out of Kosma and reached Bah

 He also ran a plow for a few days there in disguise of the farmer

 All his colleagues liked this book very much

 Not only this, Bismil had also published a few books from the Sushilmala series which included a collection of poems called Mind Wave, a concise biography of Catharine or the Goddess of Independence - Catharine Brashkovsky, Indigenous Colors and Novels of the aforementioned Bolsheviks
 swadeshi rang ke atirikt anya teenon pustaken aam pathakon ke liye aajkal pustakaalayon main uplabdh hai
 After the government announcement, Ram Prasad Bismil came to his hometown Shahjahanpur and worked for a few days as a manager in the first Bharat Silk Manufacturing Company, after that he opened a business of silk sarees in Sadar Bazar and started business with Banarasilal

 He introduced him to some publishers in Calcutta, including one Ummadatta Sharma, who later published a book titled Catharine by Ram Prasad Bismil in 1922
 san 1921 ke ahmedabad congress adhiveshan main ramprasad'bismil' ne purna swaraj ke prastaav par moulana hasarat mohani kaa khulkar samarthan kiya or antatogatva gandhi ji se asahyog aandolan prarambh karne kaa prastaav paarit karvaa kar hi maane
 Due to this he became very popular among the youth
 samooche desh main asahyog aandolan shuru karne main shahjahanpur ke swayamsevakon kii aham bhoomika thi
 But when Gandhiji withdrew the non-cooperation movement after consulting Chauri Chaura in 1922, in the Congress of 1922, Bismil and his colleagues opposed Gandhiji in such a way that two ideologies were formed in the Congress again - a liberal or Liberals and Second Rebel or Rebellion
 gandhi ji vidrohi vichaardhaara ke navayuvakon ko congress kii aam sabhaaon main virodh karne ke kaaran hameshaa hulladbaj kaha karte the
 At one time he wrote a letter to Jawaharlal Nehru and severely reprimanded for supporting the revolutionary youth

 If seen, it was his great visionary thinking at that time

 In this revolutionary published in English as The Revolutionary, the ideological thinking of revolutionaries * can be understood well
 is patr kaa avikal hindi kavyanuwaad ab hindi vicistrot par bhi uplabdh he
 Seeing this 4-page manifesto published as The Revolutionary, the British government started searching for its author in Bengal
 sanyog se shacheendra nath sanyaal bankura main us samay giraftaar kar liye gayi jab ve yah ghoshnaptr apane kisi saathi ko post karne ja rahe the
 Similarly, as soon as Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee got a party meeting from Kanpur, he got off the train at Howrah station that he was caught with a lot of copies of the HRA Constitution
 unhen hazaribagh jail main band kar diya gaya
 After the arrest of both the prominent leaders, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh as well as the revolutionary members of Bengal came on the shoulders of Ram Prasad Bismil
 bismil kaa swabhaav tha ki ve yaa to kisi kaam ko haath main lete na the or yadi ek baar kaam haath main le liya to use puraa kiye bagaiyr chhodte na the
 There was a need for money for the work of the party earlier, but now it has increased even more
 kahin se bhi dhan praapt hota na dekh unhone 7 march 1925 ko bichpuri tathaa 24 may 1925 ko dwarkapur main do raajnneetik dakaitiyaan daaleen
 But he could not get any special money in them
 in donon dakaitiyon main ek-ek vyakti maukey par hi maaraa gaya
 Due to this, Bismil's soul suffered immensely
 antatah unhone yah pakkaa nishchay kar liya ki ve ab keval sarkari khajaana hi lootenge, hindustan ke kisi bhi rais ke ghar dakaiti bilkul na daalenge
 a decision was made at an emergency meeting held on 7 August 1925 at his house in Shahjahanpur and on 9 August 1925, a total of 10 people led by Bismil from Shahjahanpur railway station, including Ashfaq Ulla Khan, Rajendra Lahiri, Chandrashekhar Azad, Shacheendranath Bakshi, Manmathanath Gupt, Mukundi Lal, Keshav Chakraborty, Murari Sharma and Banwari Lal, boarded the 8 Down saharanpur-lucknow passenger train

 The range of these mausers was also higher than that of ordinary pistols

 Stopping at Kakori railway station before Lucknow, as soon as the train moved forward, the revolutionaries pulled the chain and stopped it and dropped the box of government treasury from the guard compartment

 Manmathnath Gupta eagerly pressed the trigger of the Maujar, causing the missed bullet to the passenger named Ahmed Ali
 vah maukey par hi dher ho gaya
 In a hurry, a sheet of leather filled with silver coins and notes was tied in sheets and a sheet was left there to escape from there

 The British government took this train robbery seriously and handed over the task of investigating the fastest police in Scotland, under the leadership of Mr
 RA Harton, an assistant to the D

 The police put up advertisements in all the prominent places to give information in connection with the Kakori case and announce the reward for arresting any person involved in the conspiracy
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki police ko ghatnasthal par mili chadar main lage dhobi ke nishaan se is baat kaa pataa chal gaya ki chadar shahjahanpur ke hi kisi vyakti kii he
 On inquiring from the dhobis of Shahjahanpur it was found that the chadar was of Banarasi Lal
 banarsi laal se milakar police ne sara bhed praapt kar liya
 It was also known that on 9 August 1925, who were his partymen from Shahjahanpur went out of the city and when did they return? When intelligence was confirmed that Ram Prasad Bismil, the leader of HR was not in the city that day, then on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was accompanied by more than 40 people from all over India
 Was arrested

 Except five of them - Chandrashekhar Azad, Murari Sharma, Keshav Chakraborty, Ashfaq Ulla Khan and Shachindra Nath Bakshi, who did not come into the hands of the police, the remaining people were prosecuted and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment

 The police broke Banarasi Lal in the lockup, fearing severe punishment
 shahjahanpur jila congress cameti main party-fund ko lekar isi banarsi kaa bismil se jhagada ho chukaa tha
 Bismil, who was then the Auditor of the District Congress Committee, suspended Banarasi from the primary membership of the Congress party, proving allegations of embezzlement in the party fund
 baad main jab gandhi ji 16 oktober 1920 ko shahjahanpur aaye to banarsi ne unase milakar apana paksh rakkha
 At that time, Gandhiji made a reconciliation between the two, saying that they should not give so much money to the small hera-hai
 parantu banarsi bada hi dhoort aadmi tha
 He first apologized to Bismil and then took Gandhiji aside and filled his ears that Ramprasad is a very criminal type
 ve isaki kisi baat kaa na to swayan vishwaas karen na hi kisi or ko karne den
 Later, this Banarasi Lal befriended Bismil and gained his trust before sweet talks and then became a partner in the cloth business with him
 jab bismil ne gandhi ji kii aalochana karte hue apni alag party bana lee to banarsi laal atyadhik prasann hua or maukey kii talash main chup saadhe baitha rahaa
 The police, knowing the difference between Bismil and Banarasi's previous quarrel with the local people, made Banarasi Lal an approver and used it as an infallible tool in the entire prosecution against Bismil
 banarsi laal vyapaar main saajheedaar hone ke kaaran party sambandhi aisi-aisi gopneey baaten jaanata tha, jinhen bismil ke atirikt or koi bhi na jaan saktaa tha
 It is mentioned by Ram Prasad Bismil in his autobiography
 lakhanu jila jail, jo un dinon sanyukt praant kii central jail kehalaati thi, kii 11 nambar barrack main sabhi krantikariyon ko ek saath rakkha gaya or hajratganj chauraahey ke paas ring theatre naam kii ek aaleeshaan building main asthai adaalat kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 This building, named Ring Theater, used to be between Kothi Hayat Bakhsh and Mallika Ahad Mahal, in which British officers used to entertain themselves by watching movies and drama etc
 isi ring theatre main lagaataar 18 maheene tak king emperor varses ram prasad 'bismil' and adars ke naam se chalaaye gayi aitihaasik mukademe main british sarkaar ne 10 lakh rupee us samay kharch kiye the jab sone kaa mulya 20 rupee tola hua karata tha
 This building was also demolished later by the orders of the British rulers, and in its place in 1929-1932, a second grand building was named as GPO Lucknow
 1947 main jab bharat aaazaad ho gaya to yahan gandhi ji kii bhavy pratimaa sthapit karke rahi sahi kasar nehru sarkaar ne puri kar di
 When the non-congress Janata government was first formed at the center, at the time of the Kakori martyr's half-century celebrations organized in 1977, with the collective efforts of the surviving revolutionaries of that time, the Kakori pillar was unveiled by Uttar Pradesh Governor Ganpatirao Devrao Tapase here so that the site May the memory of is aitihaasik mukademe main sarkari kharche se harkarannath mishra ko krantikariyon kaa vakil niyukt kiya gaya jabaki jawaharlal nehru ke rishte main saale lagane vaale suprasiddh vakil jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko ek sochi samajhi ranneeti ke antargat sarkari vakil banaaya gaya
 Jagat Narayan left no stone unturned to get all the revolutionaries punished severely
 yah vahi jagat narayan the jinaki marji ke khilaaf san 1916 main bismil ne lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak kii bhavy shobhaayatra puure lakhanu shahar main nikaali thi
 Irked by this, in the Mainpuri conspiracy, the same Mullaji insisted on his status as a government lawyer, but he could not expose even one child of Ram Prasad Bismil as Bismil escaped in the Mainpuri conspiracy and for two years, the police only Do not come

 Though none of these accused got involved in this scheme for their personal benefit but since neither has done any remorse over their work nor has pledged to keep themselves away from such activities in future hence Whatever punishment has been given has been thoughtfully done and in this condition no exemption of any kind can be given in it
 phir bhi, inamen se koi bhi abhiyukt yadi likhit main pashchaatap prakat karata he or bhavishya main aisa na karne kaa vachan detaa he to unki apil par apper court vichaar kar sakati he
 The absconding revolutionaries arrested Ashfaq Ullah Khan and Shachindra Nath Bakshi much later

 Jagatnarayan 'mulla' was tasked with keeping the government side, while KC Dutt, Jayakaranath Mishra and Kripa Shankar Hajela, on behalf of the convicted revolutionaries, advocated Rajendra Nath Lahiri, Thakur Roshan Singh and Ashfaq Ullah Khan respectively
 ram prasad bismil ne apni pairvi khud kii kyonki sarkari kharche par unhen lakshmishankar mishra naam kaa ek bada saadhaaran-sa vakil diya gaya tha jisko lene se unhone saaf manaa kar diya
 When Bismil argued against the verdict in fluent English in front of the Chief Court, then Mulla ji, the public prosecutor, looked at the armpits
 bismil kii is tark kshamta par chif justise louis sharts ko unase yah poochna padaa - "mistar ramprasad! from vitch univarsity you haev teken da degree of laa?" is par unhone hans kar kaha tha- "excuj me sar! e kingmekar dajant rikhwire eni degree
 "the court was irritated by this reply and rejected the plea made by Bismil on 18 July 1927 itself
 uske baad unhone 76 prishth kii tarkpurna likhit bahes pesh kii
 After reading it, the judges expressed doubt that Bismil had written this debate by some jurist instead of writing it himself
 aakhirkaar adaalat dwaara unheen lakshmishankar mishra ko bahes karne kii ijaajat di gayi jinhen lene se bismil ne manaa kar diya tha
 The trial of Kakori case was going on in Lucknow

 He used the word "mulajim" instead of "muljiman" for the accused
 phir kya tha, pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne tapaak se un par ye chutili fabti kasi: "mulajim hamako mat kahiye, bada afsos hota he; adaalat ke adab se ham yahan tasharif laaye hai
 We turn around with our juridis; That we have also lit lamps in the intestines often
 " unke kehane kaa matlab tha ki mulajim ve nahin, balki mullah ji hai jo sarkaar se tankhwaah pate hai
 He is a political prisoner, so deal with him

 Mulla ji was left with sweat and he thought good in cutting the trowel

 Then they did not cross-examine that day
 chif court main shacheendra nath sanyaal, bhoopendra nath sanyaal va banavaari laal ko chhodkar shesh sabhi krantikariyon ne apil kii thi
 According to the judgment which was given on 22 August 1927, Ram Prasad Bismil, Rajendra Nath Lahiri and Ashfaq Ullah Khan were imprisoned for life under 121 and 120 of IPC, and 302 and 396 according to hanging and Thakur Roshan Singh
 5 + 5 = 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in two cases and hanged according to the next two times
 shacheendra nath sanyaal, jab jail main the tabhi likhit rup se apane kiye par pashchaatap prakat karte hue bhavishya main kisi bhi krantikari karrwai main hissaa na lene kaa vachan de chuke the
 Based on this, his life-imprisonment remained intact

 Despite appeals to the Chief Court, the decorations of Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Mukundi Lal and Govindcharan Kar were increased from 10 to 10 years in life imprisonment
 sureshchandra bhattacharya va vishnusharan dublish kii sajaayen bhi yathaavat kaayam raheen
 Pranvesh Chatterjee's sentence was reduced from 5 years to 4 years only due to writing appeals in beautiful handwriting

 As soon as the decision of the Chief Court came, sensation spread throughout the country
 thakur manajit singh rathore ne central legislative kauncil main kakori kand ke sabhi phaansi praapt kaidiyon kii sajaayen kam karke aaajeevan karawas main badalane kaa prastaav pesh karne kii soochna di
 Many council members also gave an application to Sir William Morris, who was then governor of the United Provinces, but they rejected it
 central kauncil ke 78 sadasyon ne tatkaaleen vysarai va governor general edward fredrick lindle wood ko shimla main hastakshar yukt memorial bheja jis par pramukh rup se pan madan mohan malviya, mohammad ali jinna, en si kelkar, lala lajpat raay, govind vallabh pant, aadi ne hastakshar kiye the kintu vysarai par uskaa bhi koi asar na hua
 Finally, a delegation of five persons headed by Madan Mohan Malaviya went to Shimla and met the Viceroy and prayed that all these four accused had written to the government that they would undertake any such activity in future
 Will not participate and he has also expressed remorse for his actions, so Judgment can be reconsidered
 chif court ne apane faisle main bhi yah baat likhi thi
 Despite this the Viceroy flatly refused him
 antatah barrister mohan laal saxena ne privi kauncil main kshamaadaan kii yachika ke dastauez taiyaar karke england ke vikhyath vakil es el polak ke paas bhijwaye
 But the judges of London and the legal advisors of the emperor argued very strongly that Ram Prasad Bismil, the architect of this conspiracy, is a very dangerous and professional criminal
