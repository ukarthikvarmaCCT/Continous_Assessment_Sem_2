 baad ke varshon main jab unhone vidhyalay main pravesh liya to bhi paaramparik shiksha main inkaa kabhi bhi man nahin laga
 Ramanujan attained the highest marks in the entire district in the primary examination at the age of ten and reached the town high school for further education
 ramanujan ko prashn poochna bahut pasand tha
 His questions sometimes seemed very strange to the teachers
 jaise ki-sansar main pehla purush koun tha? prithvi or badalon ke bich kii duuri kitni hoti he? ramanujan kaa vyavhaar bada hi madhur tha
 His somewhat more gross body and glowing eyes of curiosity gave him a different identity
 inke sahpaathiyon ke anusaar inkaa vyavhaar itnaa saumy tha ki koi inase naaraaz ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 His talent in the school started making a mark on other students and teachers
 inhone skool ke samay main hi kalege ke str ke ganit ko pard liya tha
 Once the headmaster of his school had also said that the criteria for examinations to be held in the school does not apply to Ramanujan
 hiskool kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad inhen ganit or angreji me achche ank laane ke kaaran subramanyam chaatravrutti mili or aage kalege kii shiksha ke liye pravesh bhi mila
 a further problem occurred
 ramanujan kaa ganit ke prati prem itnaa bad gaya tha ki ve duusare vishyon par dhyaan hi nahin dete the
 He used to solve mathematics questions even in history, biology classes
 nateeja yah hua ki gyarahavin kaksha kii pariksha main ve ganit ko chhod kar baaki sabhi vishyon main fail ho gaye or parinamswaroop unako chaatravrutti milani band ho gai
 One, the financial condition of the house was poor and scholarship was not being received from above
 ramanujan ke liye yah bada hi kathin samay tha
 He also did some maths tuition and ledger work to improve the condition of the house
 kuch samay baad 1907 main ramanujan ne phir se barahavin kaksha kii privet pariksha di or anuteern ho gaye
 And with this, their traditional education was celebrated
 vidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaa paanch varshon kaa samay inke liye bahut hataasha bharaa tha
 At this time India was caught in the shackles of subordination
 chaaron taraf bhayankar garibi thi
 At such a time, Ramanujan had neither a job nor an opportunity to work with any institute or professor
 bas unka ishwar par atoot vishwaas or ganit ke prati agaadh shraddha ne unhen kartavya maarg par chalane ke liye sadaiv prerit kiya
 Namgiri Devi was the Ishta Devi of Ramanujan's family
 unke prati atoot vishwaas ne unhen kahin rukne nahin diya or ve itani vipareet paristhitiyon main bhi ganit ke apane shodh ko chalaate rahe
 At this time Ramanujan used to get a total of five rupees monthly from tuition and lived in it
 ramanujan kaa yah jivan kaal bahut ksht or dukh se bharaa tha
 He always had to wander around to maintain his education and continue his education and had to plead unsuccessfully to many people
 varsh 1908 main inke mata pita ne inkaa vivaah janaki naamak kanya se kar diya
 After marriage, it was no longer possible for them to forget everything and drown in mathematics
 atah ve naukari kii talash main madras aae
 He did not get a job due to not passing the XII examination and his health also fell badly
 ab doctor kii salaah par inhen waapas apane ghar kumbhakonam lautnaa padaa
 After recovering from illness, he came back to Madras and started looking for a job again
 ye jab bhi kisi se milte the to use apana ek register dikhaate the
 This register contained all the work done by him in mathematics
 isi samay kisi ke kehane par ramanujan vahaan ke dipti colector shri ve
 ramasvami ayyar se mili
 Iyer was a great scholar of mathematics
 yahaan par shri ayyar ne ramanujan kii pratibha ko pahachaanaa or jiladhikari shri ramchandra raav se kah kar inke liye 25 rupaye masik chaatravrutti kaa prabandh bhi kar diya
 On this instinct, Ramanujan published his first research paper in Madras for a year
 shodh patr kaa sheershak tha "barnauli sankhyaon ke kuch gun” or yah shodh patr jarnal of indian mathematical socity main prakashit hua tha
 After completing one year here, he worked as a clerk in Madras Port Trust
 saubhaahgya se is naukari main kaam kaa boj kuch zyada nahin tha or yahaan inhen apane ganit ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa tha
 Here Ramanujan used to stay awake all night and write new mathematical formulas and then take a rest for a while and then leave for office
 ramanujan ganit ke shodhon ko slate par likhte the
 And later wrote it down in a register
 raat ko ramanujan ke slate or khadie kii aawaaj ke kaaran parivaar ke anya sadasyon kii neend chaupat ho jaati thi
 At this time there was a great distance between Indian and Western living and due to this Indians were generally very hesitant to present their things to the British scientists
 idhar sthiti kuch aisi thi ki bina kisi angrej ganitagya kii sahaayta liye shodh kaary ko aage nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa tha
 At this time Ramanujan's old well wishers came to his work and these people sent the work done by Ramanujan to the famous mathematicians of London
 par yahaan inhen kuch vishesh sahaayta nahin mili lekin ek laabh yah hua ki log ramanujan ko thodaa bahut jaanane lage the
 At the same time, Ramanujan showed some formulas of his number theory to Professor Seshu Iyer, then he turned his attention to Professor Hardy of London
 professor hardi us samay ke vishwa ke prasiddh ganitagyon main se ek the
 And was known for his strict nature and discipline
 professor hardi ke shodhakarya ko padhane ke baad ramanujan ne bataaya ki unhone professor hardi ke anuttarit prashn kaa uttar khoj nikaala he
 Now Ramanujan's correspondence with Professor Hardy began
 ab yahaan se ramanujan ke jivan main ek nae yug kaa sutarapaat hua jisamen professor hardi kii bahut badi bhoomika thi
 In other words, the way a jeweler identifies a diamond and shines it, Professor Hardy has some similar place in Ramanujan's life
 professor hardi aaajeevan ramanujan kii pratibha or jivan darshan ke prashansak rahe
 This friendship of Ramanujan and Professor Hardy proved beneficial for both
 ek tarah se dekha jaae to dono ne ek duusare ke liye poorak kaa kaam kiya
 Professor Hardy valued various talented people of that time on a scale of 100
 adhikansh ganitagyon ko unhone 100 main 35 ank die or kuch vishisht vyaktiyon ko 60 ank die
 But he gave Ramanujan a full 100 in 100 points
 aarambh main ramanujan ne jab apane kiye gaye shodhakarya ko professor hardi ke paas bheja to pehle unhen bhi puraa samaj main nahin aayaa
 When he consulted his friend mathematicians, he came to the conclusion that Ramanujan is a rare personality in the field of mathematics and that he should come to England to understand the work done by him and to further research in it
 atah unhone ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 For some personal reasons and lack of funds, Ramanujan declined Professor Hardy's invitation to Cambridge
 professor hardi ko isse niraashaa hui lekin unhonen kisi bhi tarah se ramanujan ko vahaan bulaane kaa nishchay kiya
 At the same time, Ramanujan got a research career at the University of Madras, which made his life a bit easier and he was also getting full time for research work
 isi bich ek lambey patravyavhaar ke baad dhire-dhire professor hardi ne ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye sahamat kar liya
 Ramanujan was also funded by Professor Hardy's efforts to go to Cambridge
 ramanujan ne england jane ke pehle ganit ke kareeb 3000 se bhi adhik naye sutron ko apni notebook main likhaa tha
 Ramanujan stepped on the land of London
 vahaan professor hardi ne unke liye pehle se vvavastha kii hui thi atah inhen koi vishesh pareshaani nahin hui
 Ramanujan had little trouble in England and the reason for this was his shy, calm nature and pure satvic lifestyle
 apane puure england pravaas main ve adhikanshtah apana bhojan swayan banaate the
 This journey of England brought a revolutionary change in his life
 unhone professor hardi ke saath mil kar ucchkoti ke shodhpatr prakashit kiye
 Due to his special research he was awarded BA by Cambridge University
 Also got the title of
 lekin vahaan kii jalwaayu or rahan-sahan kii style unke adhik anukool nahin thi or unka swasthya kharaab rahane laga
 The doctors called it tuberculosis
 us samay kshay rog kii koi dawa nahin hoti thi or rogi ko senetorium me rahanaa padataa tha
 Ramanujan also had to stay there for a few days
 vahaan is samay bhi yah ganit ke sutron main nai nai kalpanaaen kiya karte the
 After this, Ramanujan was named a Fellow of the Royal Society
 aise samay main jab bharat gulaami main ji rahaa tha tab ek ashwet vyakti ko royal socity kii sadsyta milanaa ek bahut badi baat thi
 In the entire history of the Royal Society, there has been no member younger than them till date
 puure bharat main unke shubhachintakon ne utsav manaaya or sabhaayen kii
 After membership of the Royal Society, he also became the first Indian to get the fellowship of Trinity College
 ab aisa lag rahaa tha ki sab kuch bahut acchhee jagah par ja rahaa he
 But Ramanujan's health was deteriorating and eventually he had to return to India on the advice of doctors
 bharat aane par inhen madras vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak kii naukari mil gai
 And Ramanujan was rekindled in teaching and research
 bharat lautne par bhi swasthya ne inkaa saath nahin diya or haalat gambhir hoti ja rahi thi
 In the case of this disease also, he wrote a high level research paper on mock theta function
 ramanujan dwaara pratipaadit is falan kaa upyog ganit hi nahin balki chikitsavigyaan main cancer ko samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 His declining health became a matter of concern for all and even now doctors have given him the answer
 ant main ramanujan ke vidaa kii ghadi aa hi gai
 In the morning of 26 April 1920, he became unconscious and by midday he gave up his life
 is samay ramanujan kii aayu maatr 33 varsh thi
 His untimely demise was an irreparable loss to the mathematics world
 puure desh videsh main jisane bhi ramanujan kii mrityu kaa samachar suna vahiin stabdh ho gaya
 Ramanujan and most of the work done by him still remains an enigma for scientists
 ek bahut hi saamaanya parivaar main janm le kar puure vishwa ko aashcharyachakit karne kii apni is yatra main inhone bharat ko apurv gaurav pradaan kiya
 His old register on which he used to write his theorems and formulas was suddenly found in the library of Trinity College in 1976
 kareeb ek sau pannon kaa yah register aaj bhi vaigyanikon ke liye ek paheli bana hua he
 This register was later known as Ramanujan's note book
 mumbai ke tata moolbhoot anusandhan santhaan dwaara iskaa prakaashan bhi kiya gaya he
 Like Ramanujan's researches, his style of working in mathematics was also bizarre
 ve kabhi kabhi aadhi raat ko sote se jaag kar slate par ganit se sutara likhane lagate the or phir so jate the
 In this way it seemed that they were solving mathematics questions even in their dreams
 ramanujan ke naam ke saath hi unki kuladevi kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 He always kept in mind zero and infinite and used the mathematical formulas to explain its interrelationships
 ramanujan ke kaary karne kii ek visheshta thi
 Earlier, he used to write a new formula or theorem of mathematics but did not pay much attention to its origin
 iske bare main puche jane par ve kehete the ki yah sutara unhen namgiri devi kii krupa se praapt hue hai
 Ramanujan's faith in spirituality was so deep that he considered any work done in the field of mathematics as a part of spirituality
 ve dharm or aadhyatm main keval vishwaas hi nahin rakhte the balki use taarkik rup se prastut bhi karte the
 He used to say that "for me that mathematics formula does not mean that i do not get spiritual thoughts
" ” Ramanujan worked mainly in the field of number theory in England for five years
 ramanujan ne nimnlikhit sutara pratipaadit kiya- The specialty of this formula is that it expresses the relation of the two most famous constants of mathematics through an infinite continuous fraction
 pai ke liye unhone ek doosraa sutara bhi diya tha- 'ramanujan number' is a natural number that can be represented in two different ways by the sum of cubes of two numbers
 udhaaharan - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9^{3}+10^{3}=1^{3}+12^{3}=1729} 
 Similarly, atah 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 aadi ramanujan sankhyaayein hai

 Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai was the leading scientist of India
 inhone 86 vaigyanik shodh patr likhe evam 40 santhaan khole
 He was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 1966 in the field of science and engineering
 dow vikram sarabhai ke naam ko bharat ke antariksh kaarykram se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is well known that it was Vikram Sarabhai who placed India on the international map in the field of space research
 lekin iske saath-saath unhone anya kshetron jaise vastra, bheshaj, aanvik urja, electranix or anya anek kshetron main bhi baraabar kaa yogadan kiya
 The most notable aspect of Dr
 Sarabhai's personality was the extent and extent of his interest and the ways in which he transformed his ideas into institutions
 srujansheel vaigyanik, safal or doordarshee udyogpati, ucch koti ke pravartak, mahaan sanstha nirmaataa, alag kism ke shikshavid, kala parkhi, saamaajik parivartan ke thekedaar, agrani prabandh prashikshak aadi jaisi anek visheshtaayen unke vyaktitv main samahit thim
 His most important feature was that he was a man of high quality who had extraordinary sympathy for others
 vah ek aise vyakti the ki jo bhi unke sampark main aata, unase prabhavit hue bina na rahata
 They would immediately establish personal harmony with whomever they interacted with
 aisa isliye sambhav ho paata tha kyonki ve logon ke hriday main apane liye aadar or vishwaas kii jagah bana lete the or un par apni eemaandaaree kii chhap chhod jate the
 Dr
 Vikram Sarabhai was born on 12 August 1912 in Ahmedabad to a rich Jain family
 ahmedabad main unka paitrik ghar nn da retreat # nn main unke bachapan ke samay sabhi kshetron se jude mahatvapurn log aayaa karte the
 This had a significant impact on the development of Sarabhai's personality
 unke pita kaa naam shri ambalal sarabhai or mata kaa naam shrimati sarala sarabhai tha
 Vikram Sarabhai got his early education in a family school started by his mother Sarla Sarabhai like Madame Maria Montessori
 gujarat college se intermediat tak vigyaan kii shiksha puri karne ke baad ve 1937 main cambridge chale gaye jahaan 1940 main prakritik vigyaan main tripoj degree praapt kii
 He returned to India when World War II started and started working at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore where he started doing research on cosmic rays under the supervision of CV Raman
 unhone apana pehla anusandhan lekh nn time distribution of cosmik rez nn bhartiya vigyaan academy kii kaaryvivaranika main prakashit kiya
 Sarabhai's research work on cosmic rays during the period 1940–45 included time-conversion studies of cosmic rays on geiger-muller calculators of high-level centers in Bangalore and kashmir-himalayas
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii samaapti par ve cosmik re bhautik vigyaan ke kshetra main apni doctrate puri karne ke liye cambridge laut gaye
 In 1947, he was awarded a doctorate degree at the University of Cambridge for his thesis on Cosmic Ray in the tropical axis
 iske baad ve bharat laut aae or yahaan aa kar unhone cosmik re bhautik vigyaan par apana anusandhan kaary jari rakhaa
 In India, he studied inter-planetary space, solar-equatorial relationship and geomagnetism
 dow sarabhai ek swapndrashtaa the or unamem kathor parishram kii asaadhaaran kshamta thi
 According to the French physicist Pierre Curie who, along with his wife Marie Curie, invented polonium and radium, Dr
 Sarabhai aimed to dream life and make that dream come true
 iske alaava dow sarabhai ne anya anek logon ko swapn dekhnaa or us swapn ko vaastavik banane ke liye kaam karnaa sikhaaya
 The success of India's space program is a testimony to this
 dow sarabhai main ek pravartak vaigyanik, bhavishya drashtaa, audyogic prabandhak or desh ke aarthik, shaikshik or saamaajik utthan ke liye sansthaaon ke parikaalpanik nirmaataa kaa adbhut sangyojan tha
 He had a unique sense of economics and management skills
 unhone kisi samasya ko kabhi kam kar ke nahin aanka
 Much of his time was spent in his research activities and he continued to observe research until his untimely death
 unke nirikshan main 19 logon ne apni doctrate kaa kaary sampann kiya
 Dr
 Sarabhai wrote 86 research articles in national journals independently and in collaboration with his colleagues
 koi bhi vyakti bina kisi dar yaa hin bhaavana ke dow sarabhai se mil saktaa tha, phir chaahe sanghathan main uskaa koi bhi pad kyon na rahaa ho
 Sarabhai would ask him to sit forever

 He believed in giving respect to a particular person and he always tried to maintain this dignity
 ve sadaa chizon ko behatar or kushal tareeke se karne ke bare main sochate rahete the
 Everything he did was done creatively
 yuvaaon ke prati unki udignata dekhte hi banati thi
 Dr
 Sarabhai had great faith in the abilities of the youth
 yahi kaaran tha ki ve unhen avasar or swatantraaa pradaan karne ke liye sadaa taiyaar rahete the
 Dr
 Sarabhai was a great institution builder
 unhone vibhinn kshetron main badi sankhya main santhaan sthapit karne main apana sahyog diya
 Sarabhai first contributed to the formation of the Research Association of Ahmedabad Textile Industry
 yah kaary unhone cambridge se cosmik re bhautikee main doctrate kii oopaadhi praapt kar lautne ke tatkaal baad haath main liya
 He had no formal training in textile technology
 atiiare kaa gathan bharat main vastra udyog ke aadhunikeekaran kii disha main ek mahatvapurn kadam tha
 At that time there was no quality control technique in most of the textile mills
 dow sarabhai ne vibhinn samoohon or vibhinn prakriyaaon ke bich paraspar vichaar-vimarsh ke avasar uplabdh karaae
 Some of the most well-known institutions established by Dr
 Sarabhai are as follows- Physics Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad; Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; Community Science Center; Ahmedabad, Darpan Academy for Performing Arts, Ahmedabad; Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, Thiruvananthapuram; Space Applications Center, Ahmedabad; Faster Breeder Test Reactor Kalpakkam; Variable Energy Cyclotron Project, Kolkata; Electronic Corporation of India Limited Hyderabad and Uranium Corporation of India Limited Jaduguda, Bihar

 chandrakantha hindi ke shuruaati upanyaason main he jiske lekhak devkinandan khatri hai
 It was composed in the late 19th century
 yah upanyaas atyadhik lokapriy hua tha or kaha jaataa he ki ise padhne ke liye kai logon ne devanagari sikhi thi
 It is based on Tilism and Aiyari and is named after the heroine
 chandrakantha ko ek prem katha kaha ja saktaa he
 This pure cosmic love story carries forward the contradiction of love and hatred between the two enemy kingdoms, Navgarh and Vijaygarh
 vijaigarh kii rajkumaari chandrakanta or navgarh ke rajkumaar virendra vikram ko aapas main prem he
 But there is enmity among the Raj families
 dushmani kaa kaaran he ki vijaigarh ke maharaj navgarh ke raja ko apane bhai kii hatya kaa jimmedaar maanate he
 However, the responsibility of this is that of Vijaygarh General Secretary, Cruel Singh, who is dreaming of marrying Chandrakanta and becoming the Maharaj of Vijaygarh
 rajkumaari chandrakanta or rajkumaar virendra vikram kii pramukh katha ke saath saath aiyaar tejsingh tathaa aiyaara chapalaa kii prem kahani bhi chalati rahati he
 The story ends with the conclusion of Virendra Singh, son of Raja Surendra Singh of Naugarh and Chandrakanta, daughter of Raja Jaisingh of Vijaygarh
 upanyaas kaa aakarshan hai tilismi or aiyaari ke anek chamatkaar jo pathak ko vismit to karte hi hai, rahasy nirmit karte hue upanyaas ko rochakata bhi pradaan karte hai

 sarson ke tel shabd kaa istemaal teen bhinn prakaar ke telon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo sarson ke beej se bane hote hai
 Like the horseradish or wasabi, this oil has a strong smell, tastes good and is often used for cooking in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Orissa, Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Assam and other regions of India and Bangladesh
 is done
 uttar bharat main mukhya rup se iskaa istemaal pakora ko talane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This oil is traditionally preferred for cooking in Bengal, although neutral-flavored oils such as sunflower are also used extensively
 yah tel lagbhag 30% sarson ke beej se bana hota he
 It can be produced from black mustard and white mustard
 sarson ke tel main 60% moninsaturated fatty acid hota he jisamen 42% irusik acid or 12% olek acid hota he, isamen 21% poliansaturated hota he, jisamen se 6% omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid or 15% omega -6 linolenic acid hota he or 12% santrupt vasa hota he
 Like all seeds of the Brassica family, including canola and turnip, mustard seeds also have high levels of omega-3 and are a common, inexpensive, plant-based omega-3 fatty acid mass production source
 Flax oil contains 55% plant-based omega-3 but is uncommon as a table or cooking oil
 soyabean tel main 6% omega-3 hota he, lekin 50% omega-6 se bhi adhik fatty acid shaamil hota he jo omega-3 ke gunon ke saath barabari karata he
 In addition to rapeseed and mustard oil, there are some other common sources of plant-based omega-3s in Western and Indian food
 khaskar jab omega-6 kaa seven kam rakhaa jaataa he, manushya ek simit maatra main omega-3 paudhon ko fish omega-3, icosepantanoek acid main parivartit kar saktaa he jo ki shaakaahaariyon ke liye upyogi-strot hota he
 In India, mustard oil is heated until it burns before cooking; This can be done to reduce odor and enhance taste
 baharhaal, adhik der tak garam hone ke parinamswaroop tel main omega-3 samaapt ho jaataa he or swasthya main isaki adwitiya bhoomika kam ho jaati he
 In Western countries, it is often sold in shops for Indian immigrants "for external use only", since mustard oil is also used in North India for rubbing and massage, which is believed to cause blood circulation
 , Improves muscle development and skin texture; This oil is also antibacterial
 kabhi-kabhi langik sansarg se pehle bhi purush apane yon shakti ko banaae rakhane yaa apane paurush ko badhaane ke liye purush guptangon main is tel kaa istemaal karte hai
 The effects of erucic acid of edible oils on human health have been controversial
 haalanki manushyon ke swasthya par iskaa abhi tak koi nakaaratmak prabhaav pralekhith nahin he
 a four-by-one mixture of erucic acid and oleic acid forms Lorenzo oil; Which is an experimental treatment for adrenolyticodystrophy, a rare disorder of neurobiology
 sarson ke tel main irusik acid kii adhikta ke kaaran ek samay ke liye sanyukt rajya, canada or europea sandh main maanav upbhog ke liye ise anupyukt mana ja rahaa tha
 This was believed to be due to preliminary studies on mice
 chuhon par baad ke adhyayan main pataa chalaa ki vanaspati vasa ko ve pachaane main manushya or suaron kii apeksha kam sakasham hote hai
 Chariton et al and others reported that in mice: "the inefficient activation of erucic acid for erucil-coa and the low level activity of triglyceride lipase for erucic acid and enzymes of betaoxidation, probably contribute to the accumulation and retention of cardiac lipids
 is prakriya ko puri tarah samajhane se pehle yah vishwaas kiya jane laga ki irusik acid or sarson kaa tel donon manushya ke liye behad vishakt hai
 Epidemiological studies suggest that, in areas where mustard oil is still traditionally used, mustard oil may protect against heart diseases to some extent
 is myne main "paaramparik" kaa arth yah he ki tel kaa taaja prayog kiya jaataa ho or vanaspati vasa, kul caloric seven kaa ek chota sa pratishat ho
 yah abhi bhi anishchit he ki yah prabhaav rakt platelets ko kam chipchipa banane ke liye irusik acid kii swatah prakruti ke kaaran he yaa α-linolenic acid ke yathochit ucch pratishat kii upasthiti ke kaaran, yaa taaze aprishkrut tel ke gunon ke ek sangyojan ke kaaran
 tirchhi parinaamon ke anya kaarnon se hue praarambhik mauton kii sambhaavna ko shaamil na karne ke kram main vaise mahamari vigyaan adhyayan main saavdhaanee baratane kii jarurat he
 The fact that early asymptomatic coronary disease can be detected easily in the post mortem and is absent in mustard oil reinforces the notion that mustard oil is protective
 aisi pahchaan kii gai he ki paaramparik samaajon main shishu kii maalish ke liye sarson ke tel kaa upyog twachaa kii akhandta or pargamyata ko nuksaan pahunchaata he
 Spicy mustard spices result when ground mustard seeds are mixed with water, vinegar, or other liquids

 te As a modeling notation, the effect of OMT notation dominates
 Although the Booch "cloud" notation was removed, Booch's ability to specify low-level design accounts was embraced

 Concepts are loosely integrated with UML in many other OO methods, with the intention that UML will support all OO methods
 As the group tried to ensure comprehensive coverage in the real-time systems domain, many others also contributed to it, whose access, Tony Wassermann and Pieter Pruchter's "object-oriented Structured Design" notation, Ray Bahr's "systems Glimpses of many of today's models, including "design with Ada", Archie Bowen's use case and time analysis, Paul Ward's data analysis, and David Harrell's "statechart" Granted As a result, UML is useful in many varieties of engineering problems, from single-process, single-user usability to concurrent, distribution mechanisms that make UML rich but even larger

 There are 14 types of images in UML 2
2 which are divided into two categories
 saat aarekh prakaar sanrachanaatmak soochna darshaate hai or anya saat saamaanya prakaar kaa vyavhaar darshaate hai, jinamein se chaar baatcheet ke vibhinn pahaluon ko darshaate hai
 These images can be classified in the same way as shown in the following picture: yumail, yumail tatv prakaar ko ek nishchit aarekh prakaar tak simit nahin karata

 In the Gupta period, the progress of the construction of temples is visible
 pehle lakdi ke mandir banate the yaa banate honge lekin jaldi hi bharat ke anek sthanon par pathar or rint se mandir banane lage
 By the 7th century, the construction of temples with stones has been found in Aryan culture parts of the country
 chauthi se chhathi shatabdi main guptkaal main mandiron kaa nirmaan bahut drut gati se hua
 Originally the style of Hindu temples may have been derived from Buddhist temples, as in the old temples of that time, the idols were found to be placed in the center of the temple and had a circumambulatory path like Buddhist stupas

 Before the arrival of semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube diodes or copper-oxide or selenic-stack diacritics were used
 dishtakaari ke kaary ke ulta kaary karne vaali yukti ko inwarter kehete hai
 Often all decorators are made by connecting one or more diodes in a particular order
 adhik diod ke prayog se praayah disi apekshaakrit adhik shuddh hoti he arthath isamen In this type of rectifier, only half of the A-C is sent under load while the remaining half is prevented from entering the load
 yah bahut kam shakti ke output ke liye hi prayog main liya jaataa he, adhik shakti ke liye nahin
 Because it transfers electric power with very little efficiency
 ek phej ke paripathon main half-wave ractifire keval ek diod kaa istemaal karke banaaya ja saktaa he
 
 teen-feji supplai main iske liye teen diod lagate hai
 Voltage Regulation = Good everej voltage = ve maiks / pai Average current = i max / pi aaremes voltage yaa prabhavi voltage = ve maximum / 2 RMS current or effective current = i max / 2 dakshata = 40

 For example, today's automobiles have a 3-phase bridge alternator with a 3-phase alternator that creates DC to charge the battery
