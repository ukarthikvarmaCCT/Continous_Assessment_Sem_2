 jo aaj bhi tatsamay ke itihaas ke sunahare pannon or paali pachhaanuun ilaake kii kumaunni soskruthik viraasat ko samete he
 It was from here that the history of the fair started and it used to start with a pagoda named Somnatheshwar Mahadev, Somnath

 prerani motor prayavarti dhara se chalane vaali motor he jiske roter kii koniya chaal stater vinding dwaara paidaa kiye gayi ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii koniya chaal se kam hoti he
 For this reason this motor is called asynchronous motor
 ise 'preran motor' is kaaran kaha jaataa he kyonki iske roter main preran ke dwaara dhara utpann hoti he kyonki roter tathaa ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii chaal alag-alag hoti he
 This motor is most commonly used due to which it is called the workhorse of industries
 isamen ghisne vaala koi avyav nahin he jisase yah bina marammat ke bahut dino tak chal saktaa he
 It is of many types- gharon main saamaanya kaaryon evam kam shakti ke liye prayukt adhikansh motaren ek-feji preran motor hi hotin hai inhen fractional horshpawar motor bhi kehete hai
 For example wings, motors for washing machines, etc
 prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi disht dhara motaron kii bhanti hi kshetrakundaliyaan tathaa armechar hote hai, parantu kuch vibhinn rup main
 They consist of two main parts: one is the stator, which remains fixed and the other rotor which rotates
 prayavarti dhara motaren bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai
 The most-common alternating current motor is the induction motor, which operates on the principle of induction
 preran motaron main stater kundalan trikla sambharan se sambhddha hota he, jiske kaaran ek ghurni chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 The conductors of the rotor can also be in the form of triangular coils, which are short-circuited by copper rings at both ends
 aisi rachana vastut:, gilahari ke pinjre kii bhanti hoti he
 Hence, such motors are commonly called 'squirrel Panzer Induction Motor', or 'panjar Motor' only
 ye motor banaavat main bahut sudrudh hote hai tathaa saath hi saath saral tathaa saste bhi hote hai
 Their efficiency is also higher than other motors of the same size
 atev in motaron kaa prayog praaia: saarvatrik he
 But the operation of these motors is, in a way, determined by the design of the rotor and cannot be changed as per the requirement
 inkaa aarambhik balaghurna bahut kam hota he, jise sudhaarney ke liye roter paripath main kuch pratirodh nivisht karnaa aavashyak hota he, parantu sthir praroop kii rachana ke kaaran aisa sambhav nahin ho paata
 Also, the resistance of the rotor drivers cannot be increased permanently, as the loss will increase more and the efficiency of the motor will decrease
 adhik aarambhik, balaghurna praapt karne ke liye dwipanjar motor prayukt kiye jate hai, jinamein ek ke sthaan par do panjar hote hai
 Depending on the type and position of the rotor grooves, some variation in operating characteristics can be achieved and they can be qualified for a variety of purposes
 kisi asi motor kii tulykaalik chaal n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} se aashay uske stater ke ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii chaal se he
 Its value can be derived from the following formula- jahaan f { \ displaystyle f} motor kii supplai kii aavriti tathaa p { \ displaystyle p} chumbakeey dhruvon kii sankhya he udhaaharan ke liye, 50 hertz kii supplai tathaa, 6 pole vaale teen-feji motor ke liye p { \ displaystyle p} = 6 tathaa n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} = 1,000 RPM Slip s { \ displaystyle s} is often defined as follows- jahaan n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} sincronas speed, n r { \ displaystyle n_{r}} roter kii chaal yadi roter sincronas chaal se gum rahi ho to slip kaa maan shunya hoga, yadi roter bilkul na chal rahi ho to slip kaa maan 1 hoga
 The value of the fault generated by the motor depends on the slip of its rotor
 jisko 'slip-tork vaishishty' kaha jaataa he
 It is clear that induction motors run at 'almost' constant speed
 bhaar ke saath unka chaal vicharan bahut kam hota he
 Therefore, loads that require steady movement are very useful there
 parantu jahaan vicharanshil chaal kii aavashyaktaa ho, vahaan panjar motor saamanyat: prayukt nahin kiye jate
 Their speed is slightly less than synchronous speed, which depends on the pole number and frequency
 at: chaal vicharan karne ke liye yaa to dhruv sankhya main parivartan karnaa aavashyak he, athwa aavriti kaa hi vicharan karnaa aavashyak he
 Frequency variance refers to arranging a separate supply whose frequency can be changed
 iske liye aajkal char aavriti drive aa rahe hai
 The pole number can be changed to a specific ratio by changing the connection of the coil, such as it is possible to convert a 4 polar motor to an 8 polar or 6 polar motor
 is prakaar in dhruv sankhyaon ke tatsambandhi veg bhi praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 The synchronous speed of 4 polar motor at 1,500 cyclic frequency is 1,500 RPM and that of 6 polar and 8 polar are 1,000 and 750 RPM respectively
 is tarah aisi motor kii dhruv sankhya main parivartan kar, inaki tatsambandhi chaal praapt kii ja sakati he
 But these can only happen in two or three sequences
 is vidhi se vistrut paraas main chaal vicharan praapt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Another method of gait variance in certain sequences is called "sopanipat control"
 yah vidhi belan milon main adhiktar prayukt kii jaati he
 Different types of machine tools also require variable speed, but in general, the variance is done by changing the gear order
 sab-sabzi pilav ek avadhi vyanjan he
 Its main ingredient is basmati rice

 His opinion is as follows: - padvigyaan or vaakya-vigyaan main antar yah he ki pad-vigyaan main padon kii rachana kaa vivechan hota he
 Therefore, it is considered how the Bodhaka words of division, factor, inflection, speech, gender, time, man, etc
 are formed in it
 vaakya-vigyaan usase agali koti he
 In this , there is a discussion of topics like where, how and why there are differences in the meaning of keeping the posts made by the aforesaid method 
 dhawani nirmaapak tatva hai
 Such as soil, cotton etc; The designations are those elements that can be used, such as brick, clothes, etc 
; Sentence is the form that is used in real form, such as houses, stitched clothes, etc

 From a fundamental point of view, there is a fundamental difference between sound, verse and sentence
 dhawani multah uccharan se sambhddha he
 Or arises from physical trade, so in sound mainly physical trade is predominant
 pad main dhwani or sarthakata donon kaa samanvay he
 Sound is the physical side and meaning is the mental side
 pad main shaareerik or maansik donon tattvon ke samanvay se vah vaakya main prayog ke yogya ban jaataa he
 Meaning is concerned with thought
 vichaar man kaa kaary he, atah pad main maansik vyapaar bhi he
 Thoughts in a sentence, coordination of thoughts, expression in a meaningful and coordinated form, all these functions are related to thoughts and thinking, hence mental work
 vaakya main maansik athwa manovaigyanik paksh mukhya hota he
 The complete expression of thoughts comes from the sentence, so the sentence is considered to be the least meaningful unit of the language

 1921 main gandhiji se milane ke baad baba raghavdas swatantra bharat kaa sapana saakaar karne ke liye swatantraaa sangram main kud gaye tathaa saath hi saath janaseva bhi karte rahe
 During the freedom struggle, this Karmayogi had to eat the jail air several times, but this true red of Mother Bharati, without being distracted, continued to do his work with full devotion
 1931 main gandhiji ke namak satyagrah ko safal banane ke liye raghavababa ne kshetra main kai sthanon par jansabhaayen kii or janata ko sachet kiya
 How much Baba was loved by the devarians, it can be estimated from this that the MLA of 1948
 He defeated eminent educationist, social reformer and freedom fighter fighter Acharya Narendra Dev in the election
 baba raghavdas ne apana sara jivan janata kii seva main samarpit kar diya
 He established many philanthropic institutions and also led many philanthropic works
 15 janvari 1958 ko maan bharti kaa yah sapoot, janata kaa sachcha sevak apano se vidaa lekar brahm main villin ho gaya
 Many educational institutions in eastern Uttar Pradesh have been named after him in his memory, such as- jeremi bre ek antarrashtriya cricket khilaadi he jo isisi kii cricket team ireland cricket team ke khilaadi he
 Jeremy is known primarily for batting, having started his one-day international cricket career in 2006
 maanav jivan ke lakshyabhoot chaar purushaarthon main "kaam" anyatam purusharth mana jaataa he
 There is huge literature related to it in Sanskrit language
 kaamshaastra kaa adharapeeth he - maharishi vatsyayanrachit kamasutra
 Framed in the sutra style, Vatsyayana's most important book does not hold its own in the subject's comprehensiveness and style
 maharishi vatsyayan is shaastra main pratishthata hi maane ja sakate hai, udbhaavak nahin, kyonki unase bahut pehle is shaastra kaa udbhav ho chukaa tha
 We can divide the history of Kamasastra into three periods - pre-vatsyayan period, Vatsyana period and post-post-vatsyayana period
 kaha jaataa he, prajapati ne ek lakh adhyyon main ek vishaal granth kaa pranayan kar kaamshaastra kaa anrabh kiya, parantu kalantar main maanvon ke kalyaan ke liye iske sankshep prastut kiye gaye
 According to the mythological tradition, by the will of Mahadev, "nandi" composed a summary of it in one thousand chapters, to make it even more useful, Uddalak Muni's son Shvetketu shortened it in five hundred chapters
 iske anantar paanchal babhavy ne tritiyansh main isaki or bhi sankshipt kiya—dedh sau adhyyon tathaa saat adhikranon main, kalantar main saat mahneey aacharyon ne prayek adhikaran ke upar saat swatantra granthon kaa nirmaan kiya— The fruit of this separate work proved harmful for the propagation of the scripture and gradually it started to get rid of
 falat: vatsyayan ne in saaton adhikaran grarthon kaa saransh ekatra prastut kiya or is vishisht prayaas kaa parinat fal vatsyayan kamasutra hua
 Thus the emancipation of the literary centuries of the centuries of the present Kamasutra must be understood, although it is difficult to accept the expansion of this infinite practice of tradition-declared Kamasutra texts
 purvavatsyayan kaal ke aacharyon kii rachanaaon kaa vishesh pataa nahin chalata
 Vatsyayan has directed Brahmavraya's opinion with great respect in his book
 ghotkamukh or gonrdeey ke mat kaamshaastra or arthshaastra main ullikhit milte he
 Only the introduction of the existence of adopted and Kuchimar texts is well available to us
 acharya dattak kii vicitra jeevanakatha kamasutra kii jaimangla tikaa main he
 We are familiar with the subject of Kuchimar composed system even though it is not fully available
 is tantra main kamopayogi aushadhon kaa varnan he jiskaa sambandh brinhan, lepan, vashya aadi kriyaaon se he
 The handwriting of "kuchimarantantra" has been available from Madras, which the author gives the name of "upanishad" and due to which the tribunal propounded therein became known as "aupanishadic"
 vatsyayan kaa yah granth sutratmak he
 It is divided into seven tribunals, 36 chapters and 64 cases
 isamen chitrit bhartiya sabhyataa ke upar gupt yug kii gahari chhap he, us yug kaa shishtsabhy vyakti "naagarik" ke naam se yahan diya gaya he ki kamasutra bhartiya samajashaastra kaa ek maanya granthratna ban gaya he
 The purpose of the scripture is the nirvana of the folk journey, not the growth of the raga
 is taatpary kii siddhi ke liye vatsyayan ne ugr samadhi tathaa brahmacharya kaa paalan kar is granth kii rachana kii— The text is divided into seven tribunals
 pratham adhikaran main shaastra kaa samuddesh tathaa naagarik kii jeevanayatra kaa rochak varnan he
 The Second Tribunal provides a detailed account of the rhetoric
 puure granth main yah sarvaadhik mahatvashaalee khand he jiske das adhyyon main ratikreeda, aalingan, chumban aadi kamkriyaaon kaa vyapak or vistrut pratipaadan he
 In the third tribunal, the selection of the girl is the main subject, which also describes the meaning of the associated marriage
 chaturth adhikaran main bharya kaa kartavya, sapatni ke saath uskaa vyavhaar tathaa raajaaon ke ant:poor ke vishisht vyavhaar kramash: varnit hai
 The Fifth Tribunal gives a vivid description of subduing the perdara in which a comprehensive picture of the doi's work is available to us here
 shashth adhiktaran main veshyaaon, ke aacharan, kriyalap, dhanikon ko vash main karne ke hatkande aadi varnit hai
 The subject of the seventh authority is related to Vaidya Shastra
 yahan un aushadhon kaa varnan he jinka prayog or seven karne se sharir ke donon vastuon kii, shobhaa or shakti kii, vishesh abhivruddhi hoti he
 The Vaidyaka scripture of this remedy states "brihayoga"
 rachana kii drushti se kamasutra kautilya ke "arthshaastra" ke samaan he—chust, gambhir, alpakaay hone par bhi vipul arth se mandit
 Both have the same style - formulas; Even if there is a difference in the period of creation, the Arthashastra is of the Maurya period and the Kamasutra is of the Satavahana or Gupta period
 kamasutra ke upar chaar tikaayen praapt hoti hai- The following published critical commentaries on Kamasutra are - madhyayug ke lekhakon ne kaamshaastra ke vishay main anek granthon kaa pranayan kiya
 Their original shelter is the Grantharatna of Vatsyayana and new facts about Ratikrida have been specifically included
 aise granthkaaron main katipay kii rachanaayen khyatipraapt hai — Other published works in bahush: prakashit granthon ke atirikt kaamshaastra kii anek aprakashit rachanaayen uplabdh hai - The composition of these texts shows the prevalence and popularity of this scripture

 Half of the main axis is the semi-main axis and thus runs through the navel from the center to the edge of the ellipse; Essentially, it is a measure of the radius of the orbit, taken from the farthest points of the orbit

 Piaget is a major figure in the field of developmental psychology
 anek paandityapurna avadharanaon ke liye ham piyaaje ke rini hai jinamein aaj bhi tike rahane kii kshamta or aakarshan he, jaise samaayojan / aatmsatkaran, anukulan vastu sthayitv, aatmakenndrikaran, sangrakshan, tathaa parikaalpanik-nigamit soch 
 We are also indebted to Piaget, along with William James and John Dui, for their current vision of being active, creative thinkers of children
 bacchon kaa nirikshan karne kii piyaaje main vilakshan pratibha thi
 Her careful observations showed us sensible ways of discovering how children interact and interact with their world
 piyaaje ne hamen sangyanatmak vikaas main kuch khaas chijen khojna sikhaaya, jaise purvasankriyaatmak soch se moort sankriyaatmak soch main hone vaala badlaav
 He also showed us how children need to make their plans relevant to their experiences, cognitive structures as well as their own plans
 piyaaje ne yah bhi dikhalaayaa ki yadi parivesh kii sanrachana aisi ho jisamen ek str se duusare str tak dhire-dhire badhane kii suvidha ho to, sangyanatmak vikaas hone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 We are also indebted to him for the prevailing belief that concepts do not suddenly appear in their full form, but rather develop through a series of small partial achievements that result in a more complete understanding
 shiksha par piyaaje kaa bahut prabhaav padaa he, vishesh rup se praarambhik or madhya bachapan ke dauraan shiksha par
 The three principles derived from his epistemology still have a wide impact on the training of teachers and the methods adopted within the classroom
 piyaaje kaa anusaran karne vaali kaksha main bacchon ko parivesh ke saath swatah sfoort / sahaj rup se kriya karte hue chizon ko khud se khojane ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 Rather than literally presenting pre-prepared knowledge, teachers facilitate a variety of activities that encourage discovery - such as art, puzzles, table games, various costumes, things to make, books, measurements
 Tools, music, instruments and more
 piyaaje vaali kaksha vikaas kii gati ko badhaane kii koshish nahin karti
 Piaget believed that appropriate learning experiences of children develop from their immediate thinking
 shikshak bacchon ko dhyanpurvak dekhte hai, unki baaten sunate hai, or unhen aise anubhav sulabh karaate hai, jinamein ve nai khoji gai yojanaon kaa abhyaas kar saken or jo unke sansar ko dekhne ke galat tareekon ko chunauti de saken
 But teachers do not impose any new skills on children until they show interest in and preparation for them, because by doing this they accept the sources of adults in a superficial manner, but that does not lead to true understanding
 piyaaje kaa siddhant yah maanakar chalata he ki sabhi bachche vikaas ke samaan anukram se guzarate hai, lekin unki gati / raftaar alag-alag hoti he
 Therefore, teachers should plan activities for individual students and for small groups, not for the whole class simultaneously
 iske atirikt shikshak shaikshanik pragati kaa moolyankan karte samay har bachche kii tulana usee kii pichhali sthiti se karte hai
 They are less interested in how children perform relative to any standard levels or the average performance of children of the same age
 piyaaje kaa siddhanth chunautiyon se mukt nahin rah paaya
 Questions have been raised on these areas: bachche naitik muddon ke bare main kis tarah sochate hai; iske bare main pyaaje ne ruchi jaagrit kii thi
 He observes and interviews children between the ages of four and twelve years in greater depth
 piyaaje ne bacchon ko kanche khelte hue dekha taaki ve yah jaan saken ki bacchon ne khel ke niyam par kis tarah se vichaar kiya
 He also talked to children about moral issues
 piyaaje ne paaya ki jab bachche naitikta ke bare main sochate hai, to ve do alag-alag avasthaaon se hokar guzarate he
 Since young children are at the level of morality with external authority, they make the decision of right or wrong about one's behavior by looking at the consequences of that behavior, not based on the object of the behavior
 jaise ki unke ke liye jaanboojh kar tode gaye ek cap kii tulana main haadase main 12 cap tuutane kii ghatana zyada buree he
 As children begin to move to an independent state, the purpose / intention of the person doing some work starts to become a necessary point of their moral thinking
 bahari satta ke adhar par naitik chintan karne vaale bachche yah bhi maanate hai ki niyam na badalane vaali cheez he or yah niyam kisi shaktishaalee satta ke dwaara banaae gaye hai
 The onion suggested to the young children to make new rules for the game of marbles, then the younger children refused
 duusari taraf bade bacchon ne parivartan ko sweekaara or pahachaanaa ki niyam sirf hamaari suvidha ke liye banaae gaye hai, jinhen badla ja saktaa he
 Children who think ethically on the basis of external authority also believe in the notion of 'instant justice'
 yani ki agar ek niyam todaa jaataa he to sajaa bhi milani chahie
 Young children believe that if something is broken or broken, then this work automatically gets associated with punishment
 isiilie chote bachche jab bhi koi galat kaam karte hai tab chintaa se apane aasapaas dekhne lagate hai, yah sochakar ki unhen sajaa to milegi
 The principle of instant justice also says that if something unfortunate had happened to someone, that person must have done something earlier, which resulted in it
 bade bachche jo naitikta kii swatantrata rakhane lagate he, yah pahachaanate he ki sajaa tabhi milti he jab kisi ne kuch galat hote dekh liya ho or uske baad bhi jaruri nahin ki sajaa mili hi
 How do such changes bring about moral reasoning? Piaget believes that as children get older, their thinking about social issues gets deeper
 pyaaje kaa maananaa he ki saamaajik samaj saathiyon ke saath aapasi len-dein se aati he
 Those who have the same power and position, there is a compromise between the plans and arguments are made for not agreeing and finally everything goes well
 abhibhavak or bachche ke rishton main jahaan abhibhavak ke paas shakti hoti he lekin bacchon ke paas nahin, vahaan naitik tark kii samaj ko viksit karne kii sambhaavna kam rahati he kyonki adhiktar niyam aadeshaatmak tareeke se die jate hai
 Broadly, the complaint or complaint includes all such written complaints which include wages, payment, overtime work, leave, transfer, promotion, seniority, discharge, service contract deliberations, work conditions or any foreman, supervisor, machine and tool, Relate to canteen and entertainment facilities etc

 Muktak is a type of poetry or poetry in which there is no managerialism

 Couplets of Kabir and Rahim; Meerabai's verses are all free compositions
 hindi ke reetikaal main adhikansh muktak kaavyon kii rachana hui
 The word Muktak means 'complete in itself' or 'other absolute thing'
 Thus, Muktak is a genre of poetry in which the story has no prior connection
 Each stanza in itself is completely independent and gives full meaning

 unke anusaar: In Muktak there is no flow of juice like the management, in which the reader forgets himself in the context of the story and takes a lasting impression in the heart
 There are sprinkles of juice in it, in which the heart-buds blossom for a while
 If the arrangement is a wide forest floor, then Muktak is a chosen bouquet
 This makes it more suitable for societies
 It does not display a full life or any part of it organized by successive scenes, but a delightful segment-scene is brought forth in such a way that the reader or listener becomes enchanted for a few moments
 For this, the poet has to imagine a small stanza of captivating goods and trades and display them in very concise and strong language
