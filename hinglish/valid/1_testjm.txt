 Rajendra Singh was the fourth Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which is known as Rajju Bhaiya everywhere from the common people to the Sangh Parivar

 Subsequently, from 1943 to 1967, he was appointed first spokesman in the Physics Department, then Professor and finally Head of the Department

 us samay unke pitaaji balbir singh vahaan sichaai vibhaag main abhiyanta ke rup main tainaat the

 Rajendra Singh Sarsanghchalak Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh rajju bhaiya kii sangh yatra asaamaanya he
 He came to Prayag in his youth with a vigilant and fully developed merit power in his youth
 san 1942 main em
essi
 pratham varsh main sangh kii ore aakarshith hue or keval ek-dedh varsh ke sampark main em
essi
 paas karte hi ve prayag vishvavidhyalay main vyaakhyaata pad paane ke saath-saath prayag ke nagar kaayrvah kaa daayitv sanbhaalane kii sthiti main pahunch gayi
 Prayag Department's proceedings in 1946, Jail Yatra in 1948, Divisional Affairs in 1949 comprising two three departments, Province Work in 1952 and Bhaurao Deoras in 1954, took over the responsibility of the entire province after leaving the province
 1961 main bhaurav ke waapas lautne par praant-prachaarak kaa daayitv unhen waapas dekar sah praant-prachaarak ke rup main pun:unke sahyogi bane
 If the scope of Bhaurao expanded, then again from 1962 to 1965, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh's pracharak, from 1966 to 1974, he was the field-preacher and field-preacher
 1975 se 1977 tak apatkaal main bhumigat rahakar loktantr kii vaapasi kaa aandolan khadaa kiya
 When he became a co-government in 1977, Madhavrao Mule was also given the responsibility of head-work in March 1978
 1978 se 1987 tak is daayitv kaa nirvaah karke 1987 main ho0 ve0 sheshadri ko yah daayitv dekar sah-sarkarywah ke rup main unke sahyogi bane
 In 1994, when the then Sarsanghchalak Bala Saheb Deoras started looking for his successor due to his declining health, everyone's eyes were fixed on Rajju Bhaiya and on 11 March 1994, Bala Saheb automatically handed over the top responsibility of Sarsanghchalak to him
 sangh ke itihaas main yah ek asaamaanya ghatana thi
 The eyes of the publicity media and the critics of the Sangh were torn by seeing this scene
 unhen vishwaas hi nahin ho rahaa tha ki jis rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par ve ab tak maharashtriyan brahmanon ke ekadhikaar kii chhavi thopate aaye hai, uske shikhar par uttar bharat kaa koi gaiyr-maharashtrin abrahman pahunch saktaa he - vah bhi sarvasammati se
 Rajju Bhaiya's body was diseased and relaxed at that time, but he made a lot of effort to fulfill the responsibility entrusted to him
 parantu ahernish kaary or samaaj-chintan se buree tarah tut chuke apane sharir se bhala or kab tak kaam liya ja saktaa tha
 Therefore, in 1999, he made up his mind to hand over the responsibility to someone younger
 or ant main apane sahyogiyon ke aagrahpurn anurodh kaa aadar karte hue ek varsh kii pratiksha ke baad, march 2000 main sudarshan ji ko yah daayitv saupakar svaichhik pad-sanyas kaa sangh ke samaksh ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Rajju Bhaiyya's 60-year long Sangh Yatra is not only unusual in terms of how he has successfully carried out huge responsibilities one after the other, but also with the view that from 1943 to 1966 he was with teaching work at Prayag University- Like a full-time evangelist, he wandered from place to place, carrying out all the responsibilities
 sangh-kaary hetu apni kshamta ko badhaane ke liye ve sangh shiksha varg main teen varsh ke paramparaagat prashikshan par nirbhar nahin rahe
 He received his first year training in 1947 when he had reached the status of city stewardship of Prayag
 Had prepared for tritiy varsh unhone 1957 main kiya jab ve uttar pradesh jaise bade praant kaa daayitv sanbhaal rahe the
 It is clear from this that he did the formality of training for three years to present a worthy example in front of other volunteers of the Sangh, not to gain merit for himself
 prayag vishvavidhyalay main padhaate hue bhi ve sangh-kaary main prachaarkavat jute rahe
 He was formally declared a pracharak in 1958, but the truth is that he himself gave the role of pracharak to the office of stewardship
 bhautik shaastra jaise good vishay par asaamaanya adhikaar rakhane ke saath-saath atyant saral va rochak adhyaapan style or apane shishyon ke prati sneh bhaavana ke kaaran rajju bhaiya prayag vishvavidhyalay ke sarvaadhik lokapriy or safal praadhyaapak the
 Due to seniority and qualification, he also had to hold the responsibility of the post of chairman of the department along with the professor
 kintu yah sab karte hue bhi ve sangh-kaary main apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah puri tarah karte rahe
 He never wished to become a reader or a professor
 jin dinon prayag vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee vibhaag ke reader pad ke liye aavden maange gayi unhone aavedan patr hi nahin diya
 The colleagues asked that Rajju brother! Why did you do it? So he answered very easily - "oh my life work is union work, not a university professor
 abhi main saptaah main chaar din kakshayen letaa hoon, teen din sangh-kaary ke liye daura karata hoon
 Sometimes even after trying hard, the university is unable to reach on time
 abhi to vibhaag ke sab adhyaaapak meraa sahyog karte hai kintu yadi main reader pad par abhyaarthee bana to ve mujhe apana pratispardhi samajhane lagenge
 So why get stuck in this digestion
 " rajju bhaiya kaa sampoorn jivan is baat kaa sakshi he ki unhen pad kii aakanksha athwa uskaa moh kabhi rahaa hi nahin
 Even as a teacher in the university, he did not earn for himself
 ve apane vetan kii ek-ek pai ko sangh-kaary par vyay kar dete the
 Even after being born into a rich family, getting education in public schools, interest in sports like music and cricket, he used to spend least on himself
 mitvyayta kaa ve apurv udhaaharan the
 At the end of the year, whatever was left of his salary, he was offered to the society as guru-dakshina
 ek baar rashtradharm prakaashan aarthik sankat main fas gaya to unhone apane pitaaji se aagrah karke apane hisse kii dhanrashi dekar rashtradharm prakaashan ko sankat se ubaara
 This was an expression of his all-round sanity! ni:swaarth sneh or nishkaam karm sadhana ke kaaran rajju bhaiya sabake priy tha
 Both within and outside the union
 purushottam das tandon or laal bahadur shastri jaise rajanetaaon ke saath-saath prabhudutt brahmacharee jaise santon kaa vishwaas or sneh bhi unhone arjeet kiya tha
 Along with a very sensitive conscience, Rajju Bhaiyya was also very realistic
 ve kisi se bhi koi bhi baat nixsancoach kah dete the or unki baat ko taalna kathin ho jaataa tha
 After the Emergency, when it was decided to give Nanaji Deshmukh the post of Minister of Industry in the Janata Party government, Rajju Bhaiya told him that if Nanaji will go into the government if you, Atalji and Advaniji - then who will take care of the organization by staying outside? Respecting his wish, Nanaji immediately turned down the mantripad and accepted to be the general secretary of the Janata Party
 chaahe atalji hon, yaa adwaniji; ashokaji sinhal hon, yaa dattopant thengdiji - harek sheersh netaa rajju bhaiya kii baat kaa aadar karata tha; kyonki uske peeche swaarth, kutilata yaa gutbandi kii bhaavana nahin hoti thi
 From this point of view, Rajju Bhaiya was indeed a link connecting not only the Bodhi tree but all of the Sangh Parivar, but a source of moral strength and influence
 unke chale jane se keval sangh hi nahin apitu bharat ke saarvajanik jivan main ek yug kaa ant ho gaya he
 Rajju Bhaiya was not just the body of the bones
 ve swayan main dhyeynishtha, sankalp va murtimant adarshavaad kii saakshaat pratimurti the
 Therefore Rajju Bhaiya will always live in the conscience of all
 dekha jaye to rajju bhaiya aaj mar kar bhi amar hai
 Rajju Bhaiyya was very sad that our leaders could not build a grand memorial in this country in the name of revolutionary 'bismil'
 ve turki ke rashtriya smarak jaisaa smarak bharat kii rajdhani dilli main bana hua dekhnaa chaahate the
 He had said: "it is a different thing to garner applause to enhance your image by giving a waxed speech, it is a different thing to do something for others by staying in the back
 " ve chintak the, manishi the, samaaj-sudhaarak the, kushal sanghathak the or kul milakar ek bahut hi sahaj or sarvasulabh mahapurush the
 Only such a person is born in the long term

 This place starts from Shishmatti, located in Kullu, the district headquarters

 Lagghati is also important from the point of view of tourism

 There are many methods of preserving botanical diversity, the most effective of which is to allow the plants to grow naturally in their ecology and preserve them by keeping them at their natural site - in this way plants protected by them Genetic purity remains, but rapid conservation of plants is not practical by this method, so genetic Shik diversity has to be conserved away from nature in botanical gardens, forest-trees and bio-fields

 karn mahabharat ke sabase pramukh paatro main se ek he
 Karna is considered the great hero of Mahabharata
 karn mahabharat ke sarvshereshth dharnudhari the 
 Lord Krishna and Lord Parashurama themselves acknowledged the superiority of Karni
 karn kii vaastavik maan kunti thi
 Karna was born before Kunti married Pandu
 karn duryodhana kaa sabase acha mitra tha or mahabharat ke yuddh main vah apane bhaaiyon ke viruddh ladaa
 He was the son of Surya
 karn ko ek adarsh daanveer mana jaataa he kyonki karn ne kabhi bhi kisi maangane vaale ko daan main kuch bhi dene se kabhi bhi manaa nahin kiya bhale hi iske parinamswaroop uske apane hi praan sankat main kyon na pad gaye hon
 Karna's image even today is that of a mahayodha in the Indian public who fought against adverse conditions throughout his life
 bahut se logon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki karn ko kabhi bhi vah sab nahin mila jiskaa vah vaastavik rup se adhikari tha
 Logically speaking, Karna was the real officer in the throne of Hastinapur as he belonged to the Kuru royal family and was eldest to Yudhishthira and Duryodhana, but his true identity remained unknown until his death
 karn ko ek daanveer or mahaan yoddha mana jaataa he
 Karna was born as a boon to Kunti
 jab vah kunari thi, tab ek baar durvasa rishi uske pita ke mahal main padhaare
 Then Kunti served the sage very well for a whole year
 kunti ke sevabhaav se prasann hokar unhonen apni divyadrushti se ye dekh liya ki pandu se use santaan nahin ho sakati or use ye vardaan diya ki vah kisi bhi devtaa kaa samaran karke unase santaan utpann kar sakati he
 One day anxiously, Kunti meditated on Sun God
 isse surya dev prakat hue or use ek putr diya jo tej main surya ke hi samaan tha or vah kavach or kundal lekar utpann hua tha jo janm se hi uske sharir se chipke hue the
 Since she was still unmarried, she put her son in a box and washed it in Gangaji for fear of public harm
 is As Karna was drifting in Gangaji, Maharaj Dhritarashtra's charioteer Adhirath and his wife Radha saw him and adopted him and began to follow him
 unhone use vasusen naam diya
 Karna is also known as Radheya in the name of his upbringing mother
 apane janm ke rahasyodghatan hone or ang kaa raja banaae jane ke pashchaat bhi karn ne sadaiv unheen ko apana mata-pita mana or apni mrityu tak sabhi putr dharmon nibhaayaa
 After being made the king of Anga, Karna also got a name Angaraja
 kumaar awastha se hi karn kii ruchi apane pita adhirath ke samaan rath chalaane ki bajaay yudhkala main adhik thi
 Karna and his father Adhirath Acharya met Drona, who was one of the best masters of martial arts at that time
 dronacharya us samay kuru rajkumaron ko shiksha diya karte the
 He refused to teach Karna as Karna was a charioteer and Drona only taught Kshatriyas
 dronacharya kii asammati ke uparant karn ne parashuram se sampark kiya jo ki keval brahmanon ko hi shiksha diya karte the
 Karna, calling himself a Brahmin, requested Parasurama for education
 parashuram ne karn kaa aagrah sweekaar kiya or karn ko apane samaan hi yudhkala or dhanurvidya main nishnaat kiya
 In this way Karna became a very hard working and accomplished disciple of Parashurama
 karn ko uske guru parashuram or prithvi mata se shraap mila tha
 Apart from this, Karna got many curses
 karn kii shiksha apane antim charan par thi
 One afternoon, Guru Parshuram was resting on Karna's thigh
 kuch der baad kahin se ek bichchhu aayaa or uski duusari jangha par kaat kar ghaav banane laga
 Karna used to bear the sting by not removing the scorpion so that the rest of the Guru is not disturbed
 kuch der main guruji kii nidra tuuti or unhonen dekha kii karn kii jaangh se bahut rakt bah rahaa he
 He said that only a Kshatriya could have such tolerance to bear a scorpion sting, not in a Brahmin and Parshuramji cursed him due to a false speech that whenever Karna would need his education most, That day it will not work for him
 karn, jo ki swayan yah nahin jaanata tha ki vah kis vansh se he, ne apane guru se kshamaa maangi or kaha ki uske sthaan par yadi koi or shishy bhi hota to wo bhi yahi karata
 Although Karna was enraged at cursing him with anger, he could not take back his curse
 tab unhonen karn ko apana vijay naamak dhanush pradaan kiya or use ye aashirwad diya ki use vah vastu milegi jise vah sarvaadhik chahta he - amit prasiddhi
 It is believed in some folklore to be Indra himself as a scorpion, who wanted to reveal his true Kshatriya identity
 parashuramji ke ashram se jane ke pashchaat, karn kuch samay tak bhatakta rahaa
 During this time he was learning vocabulary
 abhyaas ke dauraan usne ek gaay ke bachade ko koi vaneey pashu samaj liya or us par shabdabhedi baan chalaa diya or bachhda maaraa gaya
 Then the Brahmin, the lord of the cow, cursed Karna that just as he killed a helpless animal, one day he would also be killed when he would be most helpless and when all his attention was focused on something other than his enemy
 Will happen
 andhra kii lok kathaon ke anusaar ek baar karn kahin ja rahaa tha, tab raste main use ek kanya mili jo apane ghade se ghi ke bikhar jane ke kaaran ro rahi thi
 When Karna wanted to know the reason for his anxiety, he told that he feared that his stepmother would be angry at his inattentiveness
 krupaalu karn ne tab usase kaha ki bah use nayaa ghi laakar degaa
 Then the girl requested that she should have the same ghee mixed in the soil and she refused to take new ghee
 tab kanya par dayaa karte hue karn ne ghi yukt mitti ko apni muththi main liya or nichodne laga taaki mitti se ghi nichudakar ghade main gir jaae
 During this process, he heard the painful sound of a woman with his hand
 jab usne apni muththi kholi to dharti mata ko paaya
 Enraged by the pain, Dharti Mata criticized Karna and said that she gave so much pain to the ghee of a girl
 or tab dharti mata ne karn ko shraap diya ki ek din uske jivan ke kisi nirnaayak yuddh main vah bhi uske rath ke pahie ko vaise hi pakad lengi jaise usne unhen apni muththi main pakadaa he, jisase vah us yuddh main apane shatru ke saamne asurakshit ho jayega
 Thus, Karna received three curses on three separate occasions
 durbhaagya se ye teenon hi shraap kurukshetra ke nirnaayak yuddh main faleebhoot hue, jab vah yuddh main astr viheen, rath viheen or asahaay ho gaya tha
 This is how the various curses Karna got impacted
 yadi ek brahmastra bhi shatru ke khemen par choda jaae to naa keval vah us kheme ko nasht karata he balki us puure kshetra main 12 se bhi adhik varshon tak akaal padataa he
 And if two brahmastras are collided, then it is as if the catastrophe happens
 isse samast prithvi kaa vinaash ho jayega or is prakaar ek anya bhumandal or samast jeevadhariyon kii rachana kerani padegi
 The situation of two Brahmastras colliding in the war of Mahabharata came when Ashwatthama and Arjuna drove their Brahmastras in the ashram of sage Vedavyasji
 tab vedavyasji ne us takaraav ko taala or apane-apane brahmastron ko lautaa lene ko kaha
 Arjuna knew how to return Brahmastra, but Ashwatthama did not know this and then due to that Brahmastra, Parikshit was born dead from Uttara's womb
 lekin karn guru parashuram ke shraap ke kaaran brahmastra chalaanaa bhul gaya tha, nahin to vah yuddh main arjuna kaa vadh karne ke liye avashya hi apana brahmastra chalaata or arjuna bhi apane bachaav ke liye apana brahmastra chalaata or puri prithvi kaa vinaash ho jaataa
 Thus Guru Parshuram averted the destruction of Earth by cursing Karna
 dharti mata kaa shraap yah tha ki karn ke jivan ke sabase nirnaayak yuddh main dharti uske rath ke pahiye ko pakad lengi
 In the battle of that day, Karna used different chariots, but each time the wheel of his chariot got smashed into the earth
 isliye vibhinn rathon kaa prayog karke bhi karn dharti mata ke shraap se nahin batch saktaa tha, anyathaa vah us nirnaayak yuddh main arjuna par baari padataa
 Guru Dronacharya organized a rangbhoomi in Hastinapur on completion of the education of his disciples
 rangabhumi main arjuna vishesh dhanurvidya yukt shishy pramanit hua
 Then Karna came to Rangbhoomi and crossed the tricks done by Arjuna and challenged him to a duel
 kab kripacharya ne karn ke dvandvayuddh ko asweekrut kar diya or usase uske vansh or samrajya ke vishay main poocha - kyonki dvandvayuddh ke niyamon ke anusaar keval ek rajkumaar hi arjuna ko, jo hastinapur kaa rajkumaar tha, dvandvayuddh ke liye lalkaar saktaa tha
 Then Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, declared Karna as the king of Angadesh so that he would be eligible for a duel with Arjuna
 jab karn ne duryodhana se poocha ki vah usase iske badale main kya chahta he, tab duryodhana ne kaha ki vah keval ye chahta he ki karn uskaa mitra ban jaae
 After this incident, some of the main relations of the Mahabharata were established, such as strong ties between Duryodhana and Karna, intense rivalry between Karna and Arjuna and disharmony between the Pandavas and Karna
 karn, duryodhana kaa ek nishthavan or sachcha mitra tha
 Although he later participates in Dutikrida to appease Duryodhana, he was against it from the beginning
 karn shakuni ko pasand nahin karata tha or sadaiv duryodhana ko yahi paramarsh detaa ki vah apane shatruon ko parrast karne ke liye apane yuddh kaushal or baahubal kaa prayog kare naa ki kutil chaalon kaa
 When the attempt to kill the Pandavas in the Lakshgriha fails, Karna scolds Duryodhana for his cowardice and says that all the tricks of the cowardly fail and convince him that he should act like a warrior and he Whatever you want to achieve, get it through your bravery
 chitrangad kii rajkumaari se vivaah karne main bhi karn ne duryodhana kii sahaayta kii thi
 In his swayamvara he rejected Duryodhana and then Duryodhana took him by force
 tab vahaan upasthit anya raajaaon ne uskaa peechha kiya, lekin karn ne akele hi un sabko parrast kar diya
 The defeated kings were Jarasandha, Shishupala, Dantavakra, Salva and Rukmi etc
 karn kii prashansa swaroop, jarasandh ne karn ko magadh kaa ek bhaag de diya
 Bhima later defeated Jarasandha with the help of Sri Krishna but long before that Karna defeated him alone
 karn hi ne jarasandh kii is durbalata ko ujagar kiya tha ki uski mrityu keval uske dhad ko pairon se cheer kar do tukdo main baant kar ho sakati he
 After becoming Angraj, Karna announced that during the day when he worships Suryadev, if anyone asks for anything at that time, he will not refuse and the one who asks will never return empty handed
 karn kii isi daanveerta kaa mahabharat ke yuddh main indra or mata kunti ne laabh uthaaya
 In the midst of the war of Mahabharata, one day before Karna became the commander, Indra asked Karna in the guise of a monk for his armor-coil, because if this armor-coil remained near Karna, it was impossible to defeat him in battle
 And keeping in mind the safety of his son Arjuna, Indra demanded so much begging from Karna, but Danveer Karna did not even refuse Devraj Indra in monk's disguise and these Promised to take the boon demanded by some centers is against the dignity of donations to some demand after giving that "saying these Indra" not asked for anything
 isi prakaar mata kunti ko bhi daanveer karn dwaara yah vachan diya gaya ki is mahayuddh main unke paanch putr avashya jivit rahenge or vah arjuna ke atirikt or kisi pandav kaa vadh nahin karegaa
 And he did the same, Karna had also sought Indrastra from Devraj Indra for the slaughter of Arjuna
 karn, draupadi ke swayamvar main ek vivaah-prastaavak tha
 Unlike other rivals, Karna was able to bend the bow and propel it, but as soon as he was ready to hit the target, then at the behest of Shri Krishna, Draupadi stopped Karna from doing so by uttering a sutra
 
 pandav bhi vahaan brahman ke bhesh main upasthit the
 When other princes and kings failed, Arjuna stepped forward and successfully penetrated the eye of the fish and won Draupadi's hand
 jab baad main arjuna kii pahchaan ujagar hui to karn kii pratidwandvita kii bhaavana or gahari ho gai
 Karna never agreed with Shakuni's plans to defeat the Pandavas with deceit
 vah sadaa hi yuddh ke paksh main tha or sadaiv hi duryodhana se yuddh kaa hi maarg chunane kaa aagrah karata
 Although he indulged in the game of Dutikrida to appease Duryodhana, who later flourished in the infamous Draupadi rip-off incident
 jab shakuni chhal-kapat dwaara dyutakrida main yudhisthir se sab kuch jeet gaya, to pandavon kii pataraani draupadi ko duhshasan dwaara ghaseet kar rajsabha main laayaa gaya or karn ke uksaane par, duryodhana or uske bhaiyon ne draupadi ke vastra haran kaa prayaas kiya
 Karna insults Draupadi by saying that a woman who has more than one husband is nothing but a prostitute
 usee sthaan par, bhim dwaara yah pratigya lee jaati he ki vah akele hi yuddh main duryodhana or uske sabhi bhaiyon kaa vadh karegaa
 And then Arjuna vows to kill Karna
 pandavon ke vanvaas ke dauraan, karn, duryodhana ko prithvi kaa samraat banane kaa kaary apane haathon main letaa he
 Karna waged military campaigns all over the country and defeated the kings and promised them that he would remain loyal to Hastinapur Maharaj Duryodhana, otherwise he would be killed in wars
 karn sabhi ladaayeeyon main safal rahaa
 In the Mahabharata, Karna, in his military campaigns, waged many wars and forced numerous kingdoms and empires to obey, including Kamboj, Shaka, Kekya, Avantay, Gandhar, Madra, Trigat, Tangan, Panchal, Videha
 , Suhmas, Anga, Wang, Nishad, Kalinga, Vatsa, Ashmak, Hrishik and many others which also have mlechha and forest dwellers
 duryodhana ke saath shaanti vaarta ke vifal hone ke pashchaat, shrikrishna, karn ke paas jate hai, jo duryodhana kaa sarvshereshth yoddha he
 He tells him the real introduction of Karna, that he is the eldest Pandava and advises him to come towards the Pandavas
 krishna use yah vishwaas dilaate hai ki chunki vah sabase jyeshtha pandav he, isliye yudhisthir uske liye rajsinghaasana chhod denge or vah ek chakravati samraat banegaa
 But even after all this, Karna refuses to fight in the Pandava side, because he considered himself a debtor to Duryodhana and promised him that he would fight in favor of Duryodhana till his death
 vah krishna ko yah bhi kahata he ki jab tak ve pandavon ke paksh main hai jo ki satya ke paksh main hai, tab tak uski haar bhi nishchit he
 Krishna then becomes somewhat sad, but praises Karna's loyalty and friendship and accepts his decision and promises him that he will keep his true identity a secret until his death
 arjuna ke pita or devraj indra ko is baat kaa gyaan hota he ki karn yudhakshetra main tab tak aparaajey or amar rahegaa jab tak uske paas uske kavach or kundal rahenge, jo janm se hi uske sharir par the
 So when the battle of Kurukshetra was imminent, Indra decided that he would not allow Karna to enter the battlefield with armor and Kundal
 unhonen ye yojana banaai kii vah madhyahn main jab karn surya dev kii puja kar rahaa hota he tab vah ek bhikshuk banakar usase uske kavach-kundal maang lengen
 Suryadev also warns Karna about this plan of Indra, but he thanks him and says that if anyone asks for his life at that time, he will not refuse
 tab suryadev kehete he ki yadi vah swavachanabaddh he, to vah indra se unka amoghastra maang le
 Then, according to his plan, Lord Indra, disguised as a beggar, asks Karna for his armor and helmet
 chetaye jane ke baad bhi karn manaa nahin karata or harshpurvak apana kavach-kundal daan kar detaa he
 Pleased with this charity of Karna, he asks her to ask for something, but Karna refuses, saying "it is against the dignity of charity" to ask for something after donating
 tab indra use apana shaktishaalee astr vaasavi pradaan karte he jiskaa prayog vah keval ek baar hi kar saktaa tha
 After this, Karna got another name as Vaikartan, because he cut his armor and hair from his body without being compressed and donated it
 jab mahabharat kaa yuddh nikat tha, tab mata kunti, karn se bhent karne gai or use uski vaastavik pahchaan kaa gyaan karaayaa
 She tells him that he is their son and the eldest Pandava
 vah usase kahati hai ki vah swayan ko 'kaunteya' kahe naaki 'radhey' or tab karn uttar detaa he ki vah chahta he ki sara sansaar use radhey ke naam se jane naaki kaunteya ke naam se
 Kunti tells him that he should turn to the Pandavas and he will make him king
 tab karn kahata he ki bahut varsh purv us rangabhumi main yadi unhonen use kaunteya kaha hota to aaj sthiti bahut bhinn hoti
 But now it is too late for any change and now it is not possible
 vah aage kahata he ki duryodhana uskaa mitra he or us par bahut vishwaas karata he or vah uske vishwaas ko dhokhaa nahin de saktaa
 But he promises to Kunti that he will not kill any other Pandava except Arjuna
 karn or arjuna donon ne hi ek duusare kaa vadh karne kaa pran liya hota he or isliye donon main se kisi ek kii mrityu to nishchit he
 He says that none of his five sons will survive - four other Pandavas and one of them or Arjuna
 karn apni mata se nivedan karata he ki vah unke sambandh or uske janm kii baat ko uski mrityu tak rahasy rakhe
 Kunti asks Karna for another promise to use Nagastra only once
 karn yah vachan bhi kunti ko detaa he
 As a result, Karna is unable to use Nagastra more than once in the later battle of Kurukshetra
 mahabharat kaa yuddh armbh hone se purv, bhishma ne, jo kaurav sena ke pradhan senapati the, karn ko apane netritv main yudhakshetra main bhagidaari karne se manaa kar diya
 Although Duryodhana pleads with them, they do not believe
 or phir karn dasven din unke ghayal hone ke pashchaat gyarahawein din hi yubhumi main aa paata he
 In the thirteenth day of war, Chakravyuh / Padmavieh was created by Guru Dronacharya, the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army, to imprison Yudhishthira
 pandav paksh main keval krishna or arjuna hi chakravyuuh bhedan jaanate the
 But on that day, the tri-monarch-brothers took him far away from the site of Chakravyuh while fighting
 trigat, duryodhana ke shasnadhin ek rajya tha
 Arjuna-son Abhimanyu knew only to enter the Chakravyuh, not to leave it, which he had heard when he was in his mother's womb and his father Arjuna was explaining this method to his mother and in the middle he got sleepy 
 lekin jaise hi abhimanyu ne chakravyuuh main pravesh kiya, sindhu naresh - jaydrath ne pravesh maarg roak liya or anya pandavon ko bheetar pravesh nahin karne diya
 Then Abhimanyu fell alone in the enemy cycle
 akelaa hone par bhi vah veerta se ladaa or usne akele hi kaurav sena ke bade-bade yoddhaon ko parrast kiya
 Karna and Duryodhana decided to kill Abhimanyu as instructed by Guru Drona
 karn ne baan chalaakar abhimanyu kaa dhanush or rath kaa ek pahiyaa tod diya jisase vah bhoomi par gir padaa or anya kauravon ne usapar akraman kar diya
 Abhimanyu was killed in this war
 yuddh samaapti par jab arjuna ko ye pataa lagata he ki abhimanyu ke maare jane main jaydrath kaa sabase bada haath he to vah pratigya letaa he ki agle din kaa suryaast hone se purv vah jaydrath kaa vadh kar degaa anyathaa agni samadhi le legaa
 The war on the fourteenth continued uninterruptedly after sunset and Bhimputra Ghatotkacha, a semi-demon, massacred the Kaurava armies
 aamtaur par, asur ratri ke samay bahut adhik shaktishaalee ho jate hai
 Duryodhana and Karna bravely confront him and fight him
 antatah jab yah lagane laga ki usee raat ghatotkach sari kaurav sena kaa sanhaar kar degaa to, duryodhana ne karn se ye nivedan kiya ki vah kisi bhi prakaar se is samasya se chhutkaaraa dilaae
 Karna was forced to run on Shakti weapon Ghatotkacha
 yah astr devraj indra dwaara karn ko uski daanaparayanta ke sammaan swaroop diya gaya tha 
 But Karna could use this weapon only once, after which this weapon would be returned to Indra
 is prakaar, shakti astr kaa prayog ghatotkach par karne ke baad vah ise baad main arjuna par naa kar sakaa
 On this day, the battle of Karnaka was fought
 bhimne karnako mallayudhki chunauti di parantu bhimki durdasha hui 
 Karna dragged Bhima to the ground and took away all of Bhim's clothes
 tab karnane bhimko jivandaan diya
 Then when faced with Arjuna, Lord Krishna saves Arjuna from the Vaishnavastra of Karna
 karnane apane tirose arjunako bandi bana liya parantu suryastke kaaran jivandaan diya 
 Before the seventeenth day, Karna fought with all the Pandavas except Arjuna
 usne mahabali bhim sahit in pandavon ko ek-par-ek ran main parrast bhi kiya tha
 But as promised to Mother Kunti, she did not kill any Pandavas
 karn ne apana vijay dhanush uthaaya or arjuna par bhargavaastra chalaa diya 
 Millions of warriors were killed by Bhargavastra and went to Arjuna to protect the rest
 arjuna ne kaha bhargavaastra ko nirast karnaa asambhav he or agar karn usko bhaagane degaa to wo yuddh se bhaag jaayegaa 
 Krishna saw the frightened Arjuna and thought that when Karna would get tired, it would be okay to bring Arjun in front of him
 itnaa sochakar krishna ne arjuna ke liye palaayan kaa maarg banaaya 
 Karna withdrew Bhargavastra seeing Arjuna running away after saving his life
 satrahawein din ke yuddh main aakhirkaar vah ghadi aa hi gai, jab karn or arjuna aamane-saamne aa gaye
 Both were equal in this magnificent struggle
 karn ko uske guru parashuram dwaara vijay naamak dhanush bhent swaroop diya gaya tha, jiskaa praturup swayan vishwakarma ne banaaya tha
 On the request of Duryodhana, the maternal uncle of the Pandavas agreed to become the charioteer of Karni
 darasal arjuna ke sarathi swayan shrikrishna the or karn kisi bhi maamle main arjuna se kam naa ho iske liye shalya se sarathi banane kaa nivedan kiya gaya, kyonki unke andar ve sabhi gun the jo ek yogya sarathi main hone chahie
 During the battle, Arjuna's arrows hit Karna's chariot and his chariot slips back several yards
 lekin, jab karn ke baan arjuna ke rath par lage to uskaa rath keval kuch hi baalist dur khiskaa
 On this, Shri Krishna praised Karna
 is baat par chakit hokar arjuna ne karn kii is prashansa kaa kaaran poocha, kyonki uske baan rath ko peeche khiskaane main adhik prabhaavshaalee the
 Then Krishna said that Karna's chariot has only the weight of Karna and Surgical, but Arjuna's chariot himself and Hanuman are seated and even then Karna pushed his chariot back a few times
 isi prakaar karn ne 13 baar arjuna ke dhanush kii pratyancha kaat di
 Karna and Arjuna fought a long and fierce battle, making full use of their knowledge of wielding divine weapons
 karn dwaara arjuna kaa sir dhad se alag karne ke liye "nagastra" kaa prayog kiya gaya
 But at the right time, the chariot was sunk a little in the ground by Shri Krishna, which saved Arjuna
 isse "nagastra" arjuna ke sir ke thik upar se uske mukut ko chhedta hua nikal gaya
 The Ashwena Naga present on Nagastra requested Karna to use the weapon again so that this time he would come out piercing Arjuna's body, but Karna obeyed the promise given to Kunti, refusing to reuse the weapon
 gives
 yadhyapi yuddh gatirodhpurna ho rahaa tha lekin karn tab ulajh gaya jab uske rath kaa ek pahiyaa dharti main dhans gaya 
 He also finds himself unable to use divine weapons, as was the curse of his mentor Parashurama
 tab karn apane rath ke pahie ko nikaalane ke liye neeche utarataa he or arjuna se nivedan karata he ki vah yuddh ke niyamon kaa paalan karte hue kuch der ke liye usapar baan chalaanaa band kar de
 Sri Krishna then tells Arjuna that Karna has no right to talk about war rules and religion, whereas he himself did not follow any war rules and religion at the time of Abhimanyu slaughter
 unhone aage kaha ki tab uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha jab usne divya-janma draupadi ko puri kuru rajsabha ke samaksh vaishya kaha tha
 Where did his religion go in the sports hall? isliye ab use koi adhikaar nahin kii vah kisi dharm yaa yuddh niyam kii baat kare or unhone arjuna se kaha ki abhi karn asahaay he isliye vah uskaa vadh kare
 Sri Krishna says that if Arjuna had not yet killed Karna at this critical turn, the Pandavas would probably never be able to kill him and this war could never be won
 tab, arjuna ne ek divine astr kaa upyog karte hue karn kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 After Karna's body fell to the ground, a flame emerged from Karna's body and was absorbed into the sun
 yuddh samaapti ke pashchaat, mritak logon ke liye antyeshti sanskaar kiye ja rahe the
 Then Mother Kunti requested her sons to perform all the deceased rituals for Karna as well
 jab unhone yah kahkar iskaa virodh kiya kii karn ek sood putr he, tab kunti ne karn ke janm kaa rahasy kholaa
 Then all the Pandava brothers are shocked due to the sin of fratricide
 yudhisthir vishesh rup se apni mata par rusht hote hai or unhen or samast nari jaati ko ye shraap dete hai ki us samay ke baad se striyaan kisi bhi bhed ko chupa nahin paaengi
 Both Yudhishthira and Duryodhana wanted to perform the last rites of Karna
 yudhisthir kaa daawa yah tha kii chunki ve karn ke kanisht bhrata hai isliye yah adhikaar unka he
 Duryodhana's claim was that Yudhishthira and the other Pandavas never dealt with Karna fraternally, so now there is no justification for asserting this authority at this time
 tab shrikrishna madhyasthata karaten he or yudhisthir ko yah samajhaate hai ki duryodhana kii mitrataa kaa bandhan adhik sudrudh he isliye duryodhana ko karn kaa antim sanskaar karne diya jaae
 When the 18-day war ends, Shri Krishna asks Arjuna to step down from his chariot
 jab arjuna utar jaataa he to ve use kuch duuri par le jate hai
 Then they signal Hanumanji to come off the chariot flag
 jaise hi shri hanuman us rath se utarate hai, arjuna ke rath ke ashv jivit hi bhasma ho jate hai or rath main visphot ho jaataa he
 Arjun wakes up on seeing this
 tab shrikrishna use bataate hai ki karn ke ghaatak astron ke kaaran arjuna ke rath main yah visphot hua he
 It was safe till now because he was favored by him and had the power of Shree Hanuman, the chariot still bearing the effects of these destructive weapons
 aaj bhi lakhon hinduon ke liye karn ek aisa yoddha he jo jivan bhar dukhad jivan jeeta rahaa
 He is considered a great warrior, a great man with a courageous spirit, who struggled with the unfavorable conditions of his life
 vishesh rup se karn apni daanpriyata ke liye prasiddh he
 He is also an example of how improper decisions are of no use, despite a person's superior personality and best qualities
 karn ko kabhi bhi vah nahin mila jiskaa vah adhikari tha, par usne kabhi bhi prayaas karnaa nahin choda
 The contemporaries of Karna including Bhishma and Lord Krishna have accepted that Karna is a saint who manifests very rarely in the human race
 vah sangharshrat maanavtaa ke liye ek adarsh he ki maanav jati kabhi bhi haar naa maane or prayasarat rahe
 Karna and Arjuna have many similarities
 donon hi apane samay ke sarvshereshth dhanurdhar the, donon ne hi draupadi kaa haath jeetne ke liye pratiyogita main bhagidaari kii or donon ko apane bhaiyon ke viruddh yuddh main ladanaa padaa
 Another deep connection is that both were closely related to the Kauravas, Karna Mitravaat and Arjuna Rakrat
 unke nirnay or tadnurup iske un par or unke parivaaon par padane vaale parinaamon par is baat ke liye bal diya jaataa he ki apane kartavyon kaa paalan karne kaa kya mahatv he, jaisaa kii bhagavad gita main bhagwaan krishna dwaara bataaya gaya he
 Karna is an example of a personality who was virtuous, noble, just and courageous, but still declined because he was loyal to the unrighteous Duryodhana
 karn main ve paancho gun the jo draupadi ne apane var ke rup main mahadev se maange the, keval ek ko chhodkar or vah tha duryodhana se ghanishtha mitrataa
 Arjuna and Karna had both similarities and dissimilarities
 arjuna ko armbh se hi sukh, sampati or matruprem mil jabaaki karn ko har vastu praapt kerani padi
 Arjuna had everything that would make him victorious but Karna was completely alone
 apni sachai ke kaaran hi use saare abhishaap mili jise usne natmastak ho kar sweekaar kiya
 According to an analysis, during the war between Karna and Arjuna, there came an occasion when Arjun with such a force fired an arrow which directly hit Karna's chariot and his chariot slipped back ten steps, on which Karna also with such power Run an arrow that directly hit Arjun's chariot and his chariot slips back two steps
 karn ke aisa karne par bhagwaan krishna karn ki prashansa karne lage 
 When Arjuna asked Lord Krishna the reason for this praise of Karna, he said that i am sitting on your chariot carrying the weight of Tribhuvan and Hanumanji himself is sitting on the flag of your chariot
 use peeche khiskaana to dur ek anu ke baraabar hilaa paanaa bhi asambhav he, is par bhi yadi karn ne tumhaare rath ko do kadam peeche khiskaa diya to yah aashcharya hi nahin apitu prashansa or gaurav kii baat he Because of Karna's affection for Duryodhana, though reluctantly, he supported his beloved friend in all misdeeds towards the Pandavas
 karn ko pandavon ke prati duryodhana kii durbhaavnapurna yojanaon kaa gyaan tha
 He also knew that his fall was also certain due to hitting the truth for the sake of discrete
 jabaki kuch logon kaa yah maananaa he ki kuru rajsabha main draupadi ke liye 'vaishya' shabd kaa upyog karke karn ne apane naam par swayan kaalikh pot lee thi, vahiin kuch anya logon kaa maananaa he ki vah apane is krity main sahi tha, kyonki pehle draupadi ne use apane swayamvar main 'soot putr' kahkar uskaa apmaan kiya tha taaki vah uske swayamvar main pratiyogi naa ban sake
 Nevertheless, Karna's role in Abhimanyu's killing and the fight of one warrior to several warriors caused more damage to his image of a warrior and then the same momentum in the same war
 mahabharat kii kuch vyakhyyon ke anusaar, yahi vah krity tha jisane bhalee prakaar se ye pramanit kar diya kii karn yuddh main adharm ke paksh main lard rahaa he or is krity ke kaaran uske is durbhaagya kaa bhi nirdhaaran ho gaya kii vah bhi arjuna dwaara isi prakaar maaraa jayega jab vah shastrastra hin or rathhin ho or uski peeth arjuna kii ore ho
 Karna had full opportunity to kill Arjuna in the seventeenth day of war but following the war rules he did not shoot arrows at Arjuna because by then Suryadev had set
 karn or arjuna ke pichley janm kii katha kaa varnan padam puraana me ata he ek baar bhagwaan brahma or mahadev ke bich yuddh hota he, mahadev brahmaji ke paanchaven sar ko kaat dete he
 The pasina emerges from the body of the angry Brahmadeva
 or paseene se ek vir yoddha utpann hota he
 Born from Sveda, hence known as Svedja
 swedja pita brahma ke aadesh se mahadev se yuddh karne jaataa he
 Mahadev asks Lord Vishnu to explain some remedy to the Svedaja born by angry Brahma
 bhagwaan vishnu apane rakat se ek vir ko janm dete he
 Born from blood, therefore it is known as Raktaja
 swedja 1000 kavach ke saath janma tha or rakataja 1000 haath or 500 dhanush ke saath 
 Lord Brahma was also a son of Lord Vishnu, so Svedja was also a part of Lord Vishnu
 swedja or raktaja main bhayankar yuddh hota he
 Svedja cuts 998 hands of Raktaja and breaks 499 bows
 vahi raktaja swedja ke 999 kavach tod detaa he
 Raktaja is just about to lose
 bhagwaan vishnu samaj jate hai kii raktaja se haar jayega
 So they calm that war
 swedja daanveerta dikhaate hue raktaja ko jivandaan detaa he
 Lord Vishnu entrusts Svedaraja's accountability to Suryanarayana, and Raktaja's to Indradev
 vah indradev ko vachan dete he kii agle janm main raktaja apane pratidwandvi swedja kaa vadh avashya karegaa
 In Dwapara Yuga, Raktaja is born as Arjuna and sensation Karna
 or arjun apane sabase mahaan pratidwandvi karnaki yuddh ke niyamon ke viruddh hatya karte hai
 The following factors can be counted in relation to Karna's death: 1
 The first factor of Karna's death is Rishi Durvasa himself
 kunti ko yah vardaan dete samay kii vah kisi bhi dev kaa aahvaan karke unase santaan praapt kar sakati he, is vardaan ke parinaam ke bare main nahin bataaya
 Therefore, Kunti curiously calls Suryadev and does not care what the consequences are before marriage and according to the boon Suryadev gives a son to Kunti
 lekin lok-laaj ke bhay se kunti is shishu ko gangaji main baha deteen he
 Then Karna meets Maharaja Dhritarashtra's charioteer Adhirath and his wife Radha, they follow him and thus Karna's Kshatriya identity is denied
 karn, naa ki yudhisthir yaa duryodhana, hastinapur ke singhaasana kaa vaastavik adhikari tha, lekin yah kabhi ho naa sakaa kyonki uskaa janm or pahchaan gupt rakhe gaye
 2
 Devaraj Indra who brought Karna's Kshatriya identity as a scorpion in front of his guru and due to misinformation about his identity, his guru cursed him to forget his weapon knowledge at the right time
 3
 gaay vaale brahman kaa shraap kii jis prakaar usne ek asahaay or nirdosh pashu ko maaraa he usee prakaar vah bhi tab maaraa jayega jab vah sarvaadhik asahaay hoga or uskaa dhyaan apane shatru se alag kisi anya vastu par hoga
 Due to this curse, Arjun kills him when the wheel of his chariot gets stuck in the earth and he is focused on removing the wheel of his chariot
 4
 dharti mata kaa shraap kii vah niyat samay par uske rath ke pahie ko kha jaaegin or vah apane shatruon ke saamne sarvaadhik vivash ho jayega
 5
 Devotee Indra in the guise of a beggar, donating armor kundal sticking on his body due to his popular publicity by Karna
 6
 'shakti astr' kaa ghatotkach par chalaanaa, jiske kaaran vah vachananusaar duusari baar is astr kaa upyog nahin kar saktaa tha
 7
 Do not use 'nagastra' for the second time as promised to Mother Kunti
 8
 mata kunti ko die do vachan
 9
 Maharaj and maternal uncle of the Pandavas, the charioteer of Karna, who dropped the morale of Karna by praising Arjuna's martial arts in the seventeenth day of war
 10
 yuddh se kuch din purv jab karn ko yah gyaat hota he ki pandav uske bhai hai to unke prati uski sari durbhaavna samaapt ho gai, par duryodhana ke prati nishth hone ke kaaran vah pandavon ke viruddh ladaa
 However, until the death of Karna, the Pandavas did not know that Karna is his eldest brother
 11
 suryadev jo satrahawein din ke yuddh main tab ast ho gaye jab karn ke paas arjuna ko maarane kaa puraa avasar tha
 12

 Earlier two methods of composting of cow dung were prevalent in India, but a third method is also being practiced now
 ye vidhiyaan nimnlikhit hai: For this, appropriately sized, 20-25 feet long, 5-6 feet wide and 3 to 10 feet deep, are dug and dung is filled in them

 The upper part of the fabric is made like a dome and is coated with cow dung, so that the unnecessary water of the rainy season does not enter it
 tatpashchaat lagbhag teen maheene tak khaad ko banane ke liye chhod dete hai
 In this method, the temperature of the fabric never goes above 34 degrees, because the chemical activity in the fabric is limited due to lack of air
 is vidhi main nitrogenyukt padaarth khaad se nikalne nahin pate
 In this method, a thin fold of dung is pressed without pressing

 In this way, the special benefit is that the seeds of grass, coarse and other harmful plants, which can be present in cow dung, are destroyed when the temperature increases

 This method, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Center, uses a simple device that digests the dung in the absence of air
 is vidhi se ek prakaar kii gas nikalati he, jo prakaash karne, yantra chalaane tathaa bhojan pakaane ke liye eendhan ke rup main kaam aati he
 The cow dung is mixed with water and put in a digestive device every day and takes the above work from the gas released

 The amount of dung in India and the annual production of nitrogen phosphorus and potash present in it are as follows: kintu gobar kaa bahut thodaa bhaag hi khaad ke rup main prayukt ho paata he
 For this reason, the production of this country is very less in proportion to other countries

 Seeing the talent of music in his daughter, Gangubai's musician mother kept away her attachment to Carnatic music
 unhone yah sunishchit kiya ki unki beti sangeet kshetra ke ech krishnacharya jaise diggaj or kiraanaa ustad savai gandharva se sarvshereshth hindustani shastreey sangeet siikhe
 Gangubai once said about the teachings of his Guru Sawai Gandharva, that my Guru taught that the way a miser treats his money, use sur in the same way, so that the listener can understand the importance of every nuance of the raga

 The first of these measurements is measured by a measuring instrument of known purity or of known magnitude and the second measurement is made with a measuring instrument that has to be calibrated
 gyaat parishuddhta vaala maapakyantr maanak kehalaata he
 If the inner diameter of the thermometer tube is not universally the same, then marking the distance at an equal distance will cause errors
 faltah taap kii sachhee naap ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak hota he ki prayek chihn par kitni truti he
 Similarly, for each measuring instrument it is necessary to know how much error is there on each sign
 isi ko anshshodhan kehete hai
 No matter how carefully the instruments are made, there is definitely some error found somewhere on microscopic examination
 phir, samay bachaane ke liye yantra nirmaataa bahudhaa purna shuddhta laane kii cheshtaa bhi nahin karte
 Therefore calibration is important in microscopic measurements
 antarrashtriya vigyaan sangh ne moulik tathaa udbhoot raashiyon kii paribhaashaayen de rakhi hai or unki ikaiyaan bhi nishchit kar di hai
 Authentic instruments have been made to measure them
 yadi koi naveen maapak yantra banaaya jaataa he to uskaa anshshodhan unheen pramanik yantron ke anshon kii tulana se kiya jaataa he
 Example: Centigrade thermometer's endpoint is assumed to be the freezing point of pure water and the vertical point boiling point
 himank or kvathanank jal kii ashuddhiyon or newnaadhik vayudab ke kaaran badal jate hai
 Therefore, the following physical conditions have also been determined: Water should be pure and air pressure is 76 cm
 m Must be equal to Pardastambha

 However, the section of the tube is not ideally the same everywhere and there may be errors in calibration
 inhen kaarnon se anshshodhan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 For this the lessons of the new thermometer are compared to an authentic thermometer which is kept in the same condition with the same

 Now if the arithmetic is the same and the marks are at equal distances, then we have to do the second refinement for the midpoint and the vertices

 Therefore, in the situations presented, the thermometer's endpoint and vertices are read and compared to the authentic thermometer's text, both points are modified

 dushtataa se bhari hansee yaa paaglon-jaisi hansee ek purna rup se unmaad se bhari hansee he jo saadhaaran rup se kisi khalanaayak dwaara kapolkalpana main hansee jaati he
 The idiomatic idiom laughter has been used since 1860
 dushcharitra hansee kaa prayog usase bhi purana he or kam se kam 1784 main prayog kiya gaya he
 a similar contemptuous laughter is related to at least 1714 or perhaps even earlier in literature

 It is used in blogging, bulletin board systems, and online games
 vahaan par in shabdon ko saadhaaran rup se jab kisi prakaar kii jeet darj hoti he, yaa phir yah dikhaane ke liye ki kisi ko kisi or par shreshtataa kii bhaavana he
 These words are mostly used as exclamations and less often as nouns
 1930 main ek lokapriy radio kaarykram di shadow ne dushtataa se bhari hansee ko apni prastuti ke pahchaan sanket ke rup main baar-baar prayog kiya tha
 It was voiced by actor Frank Readick, and his voice continued even when the show was lead by Orson Welles
 vincent price kii dushtataa se bhari hansee ke sanskaran kaa kai baar radio, film, sangeet or tivi par prayog kiya gaya he
 One of them is the music video Michael Jacksonz thriller
 filmon main dushtataa se bhari hansee adhikanshtah sound trek ko us samay puraa karata he jab khalanaayak camera se dur hota he
 In these cases wicked laughter follows the real hero or any victim when they try to escape
 iskaa ek udhaaharan redrz of di lost arq he, jahaan belock kii hansee dakshin america ke jangal main chai hui hoti he jab indiana jonz hovitos se batch nikalne kaa prayaas karti he
 In the TV series Dallas, JR Erving appeared at the bar displaying his traditional laughter whenever he felt that he outbid someone, especially in the case of Cliff Burns
 gaiyr-insaani paatr jaise ki gozila shrankhla se raja ghidorah or destorah bhi apni niraali dushtataa se bhari hansee rakhte the yaa phir hansee-jaisi dhwani nikaalte the
 Laksha Griha composed by Manu Sharma: In the autobiography of Krishna, this laughter character in the religious scenario is as follows: kisi reeti se ushma ke maapan ko ushmamiti yaa 'calorimiti' kehete hai
 Specific heat, heat capacity, latent heat, etc
 of substances or processes can be determined by measuring the amount of heat that is absorbed in a chemical reaction or phase change or in any physical or chemical change or any biological process that produces heat
 Can
 ooshmaamiti kaa armbh jul ke us prayog se armbh hua jo 'calories ke yantric tulyank' ke nirdhaaran ke liye kiya gaya tha
 In fact, this experiment was based on the principle of conservation of energy
 calorimiti ke liye jo upkaran upyog main laaye jate hai unhen 'calorimapi' kehete hai! Calorimetry Principle: When two different objects are interconnected, the heat flows from the object of high temperature to the object of low temperature! ushmamiti ushma ke kisi prabhaav par aadhaarit hoti he
 Thermodynamics can be done directly or indirectly
 pratyaksh calorimiti main calorimapi dwaara ooshmaa kii maap kii jaati he jabaki apratyaksh calorimiti main ooshmaa kii maatra kii sidhe taur par maap na karke lee gayi oxygen kii maatra ke aadhaar par ooshmaa kii gananaa kii jaati he
 The following methods of direct calorimetry are generally: taapaparivartan athwa taapamaneey ushmamiti, Substitution or latent heat calorimetry
 pratham paddati main ve reetiyaan hai jinamein taap parivartit hota he tathaa maapan taapaparivartan par nirbhar hota he
 Ultimately, this method only results in observation of heat
 at: in vidhiyon main taapmaana ke avlokan main parinat ho jaati he
 Thus temperature is a key tool in these methods
 is paddati main reno kii mishran vidhi tathaa dullang or peti kii sheetalibhawan vidhi hai
 The second method involves methods that rely on the liquefaction of solids or condensation of vapors
 inamen him tathaa vaashp ushma maan sammilit hai
 In these experiments the temperature is constant due to its dependence on liquefaction and evaporation, so there is no need for temperature in them
 ushma kaa ekak ushma kii vah maatra he jo ek ekak maatra jal ke taap main 1° celsius kii vruddhi karti he
 If the unit of mass is 1 gram and then the temperature is 1 ° C
 If the unit of heat is called a calorie
 kintu 1 gram dravyaman ke jal ke taap main 1° se
 vruddhi karne ke liye prayek taap par ushma kii aavashyak maatra samaan nahin hoti 
 Therefore, scientists used 1 ° C
 The aforesaid temperature of 14

 The difference in the amount of heat required to increase one degree of heat at different temperatures is very small; Therefore, in normal experiments, 1 ° c in the temperature of 1 gram of pure water at any temperature
 One can consider the amount of heat required for growth of 1 kalari

 tapavriddhi ke liye us vastu ko deni padati he, athwa 1 sein
 taappatan dwaara usase praapt hoti he
 The heat of a substance is called the specific heat of that substance compared to the heat of water
 arthath, padaarth ke kisi dravyaman kii kisi tapavriddhi ke liye aavashyak ushma kii maatra tathaa samaan dravyaman ke jal kii usee tapavriddhi ke liye aavashyak ushma kii nishpatti ko us padaarth kii vishisht ushma kehete hai
 1 gram of water 1 ° c The heat required for heating is 1 unit of heat, so the heat of a gram of matter is the specific heat of that substance
 yadi dravyaman m kii kisi vastu kaa taap se tak badhaane ke liye aavashyak ushma kii maatra maa ho to purvokt paribhaasha ke anusaar vishisht ushma vi nimnlikhit sutara main praapt hogi: The mass of an object and the product of specific heat is called the heat capacity of that object
 ise us vastu kaa 'jal tulyank' bhi kehete hai
 Generally, when defining specific heat, it is necessary to specify the conditions in which the temperature changes have occurred
 udhaahrantaya, yadi sampeden se kisi gas ke taap main vruddhi ho to dt kaa maan shunya nahin hoga parantu dq =0
 Therefore the specific heat will be zero
 duusari taraf yadi ek gas main parimit maatra main ushma di jaae or uskaa prasaran is prakaar ho ki uskaa taap sthir rahe to is paristhiti main dt=0 hoga or dq shunya nahin hogi
 Therefore specific heat will be very high
 gas kaa prasaran is prakaar bhi karaayaa ja saktaa he ki kuch maatra main ushma to use di jaae parantu phir bhi uske taap kaa patan ho; is sthiti main dt ke rinatmak hone ke kaaran uski vishisht ushma kaa maan bhi rin hoga
 From this it appears that the specific heat value of the gas can be anything between + Eternal to - Eternal and this value is related to the circumstances
 is kaaran gas kii vishisht ushma ke vishay main taapaparivartan kii paristhitiyon kaa nirdesan atyant aavashyak he
 Therefore, there are two specific heat in the subject of gas: drav tathaa thos padaarthon main sampeden nune hone ke kaaran saadhaaran prayogon main aaytan parivartan nune tathaa naganya hote hai
 Hence only one specific heat remains
 prayek taap par thos tathaa drav kii ek nishchit vishisht ushma hoti he tathaa taap ke saath isaki vruddhi hoti he
 In this, the water is heated to a fixed temperature and the amount of heat is determined by the amount of water
 is paddati main nimnlikhit reetiyaan hai : Mixing method, sheetalibhawan vidhi, By this method Rayna discovered the ultimate pure fruit
 yadi do padaarth k tathaa kha ke dravyaman m1 tathaa m2 taap T1) tathaa T2 tathaa vishisht ushmayen S1 tathaa S2 hon or yadi ve ek-duusare ke saath rakhe jaaen to ushma ek se duusare main jaaegi tathaa falswaroop unka taap antatah T1 tathaa T2 ke bich ek saamaanya taap t hoga
 Consequently, if the regulation of heat is in a and B, then the heat given by a will be equal to the heat taken by B
 yahan hamane yah mana he ki taap ke sameekaran kii avadhi main k tathaa kha na to anya vastuon se ushma lete hai, na unhen dete hai
 In practice this stage is impossible
 saamanyatya anya vastuon se bhi ushma kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 There are special ways to correct or minimize such errors
 ushmaamaapan ke prayogon kaa mukhya upkaran taanbe, pital athwa chaandi kii patali chaddar kaa bana ushmamapi hota he
 It is placed on malleable bases within a large vessel
 ushmamapi main maape hue dravyaman kaa jal bharaa hota he, jisamen nishchit taap kii tapt vastu daali jaati he tathaa ek sookshm tapamapi se taapaparivartan padhaa jaataa he
 To run the water, there is a curved copper conductor in it
 vikiran dwaara ushma kaa kshay dur athwa kam karne ke liye ushmamapi ke bahari tal tathaa bade bartan ke bhitari tal par paalish kii jaati he
 In addition to water, the mercury of the thermometer, diffuser and thermometer take the heat of the hot substance and their temperature also increases when a hot substance is put into the thermometer's water
 at: inaki ushmadharitaaon kaa lekha lenaa bhi aavashyak he
 The increase in temperature also leads to an increase in radiation purification; For this reason, it is appropriate that the amount of water in the thermometer be taken so high that the temperature does not increase much; But doing so reduces the precision of the experiment
 iske pratikaar ke liye sookshm tapamapi kaa vyavhaar aavashyak ho jaataa he
 This method is based on the assumption that when an object cools in an inclusivity, the heat dq emitted by it during that period of time depends on the inclusions of the object, the excess of heat, the nature of its plane, and the area of the plane
 Does
 at: In this equation the object is dependent on its plane, ie its area and radiation power, and f is the unknown function of the excess of heat which will be the same for each object
 at: yadi newton kaa sheetalibhawan niyam yarthaat he to yah falan keval taapantar dt he
 If the object is cooler than the temperature dt during dt period m vastu kii sanhati tathaa s vishisht ushma he
 Therefore yadi donon vastuon ke tal ke kshetrafal samaan hon to a = A' to nimnlikhit sambandh nikaala ja saktaa he- That is, the heat capacities of both the objects are the result of those periods which take them to cool by the same range of heat

 is siddhant par aadhaarit bunsen kaa him ushmamapi dravon tathaa thos padaarthon kii vishisht ushma gyaat karne kaa ek atyant sugrahi upkaran he
 Even if the substance is available in small quantities, its specific heat can be determined
 sampurna upkaran ke chaaron ore shuddh him bhar dete hai
 Tube a contains some pure water
 jab sampurna upkaran 0° sein taap par ho jaataa he to die hue thos padaarth ko ek sthir taap sein
