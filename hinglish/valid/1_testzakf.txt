 Maharaja Agrasen was a pioneer of mythological socialism, Yuga Purush, proponent of Ram Rajya and Mahadani and the first pioneer of socialism
 ve agroday naamak ganraajya ke maharaja the
 Whose capital was Agroha dharmik manyatanusaar inkaa janm suryavanshiy maharaja vallabh sen ke antimkaal or kaliyug ke prarambh main aaj se 5185 varsh purv hua tha
 There was no unhappiness or helplessness in the rule of the entire Khandava kingdom, Ballabh Garh and the king of Agar district
 bachapan se hi ve apni praja main bahut lokapriy the
 He was a religious, peace messenger, praja vatsal, anti-violence, abolition of Bali system, Karunanidhi, loving kindness to all beings, loving kindness king
 ye ballab garh or agra ke raja ballab ke jyeshtha putr, shurasen ke bade bhai the At the time of puberty, he was invited to join the swayamvara of Raja Nagraj's daughter princess Madhavi
 us swayamvar main dur-dur se anek raja or rajkumaar aae the
 Even Indra, the king of the gods, came to visit the princess's beauty
 swayamvar main rajkumaari madhavi ne rajkumaar agrasen ke gale main jayamala daal di
 It was a combination of two different sects, castes and cultures
 jahaan agrasen suryavanshi the vahiin madhavi nagvansha kii kanya thim
 Indra got jealous of anger and anger due to this marriage and he stopped rain in Pratapnagar
 chaaron ore traahi-traahi much gayi
 People started becoming grasps of premature death
 tab maharaj agrasen ne indra ke viruddh yuddh chhed diya
 As Agrasen was fighting a religious war, his palace was heavy, seeing that the Gods made Narada Rishi a mediator and got the reconciliation between the two
 kuch samay baad maharaj agrasen ne apane praja-janon kii khushhaali ke liye kaashi nagari ja shivaji kii ghor tapasya kii, jisase bhagwaan shiv ne prasann ho unhen maan lakshmi kii tapasya karne kii salaah di
 Mother Lakshmi was pleased with the austerity done for charity and gave her darshan and said that she should create a new state and follow the Kshatra Dharma, nurture and protect her state and subjects! His kingdom will always be full of wealth
 apane naye rajya kii sthapana ke liye maharaj agrasen ne apni rani madhavi ke saath saare bharatvarsh kaa bhraman kiya
 At the same time, a lioness was seen giving birth to a cub at one place, it is said that soon after taking birth, the cub immediately jumped on the elephant considering Maharaja Agrasen's elephant as a crisis for his mother
 unhen laga ki yah divine sandesh he jo is veerbhumi par unhen rajya sthapit karne kaa sanket de rahaa he
 On the advice of sages and astrologers, the new state was named Agriyagna or Agrodaya and the place where the cub was born, Agroha, the capital of Agrodaya, was established
 yah jagah aaj ke haryana ke hisar ke paas hai
 Even today, this place is worshiped as the fifth dham for the Agrawal community, at present the Agroha Development Trust has made facilities for the people of Agrawal community who come here by building very beautiful temples, Dharamshalas etc
 maharaja agrasen ko samaajwaad kaa agradoot kaha jaataa he
 In order to establish true socialism in his area, he made a rule that in order to help every family who settled in his city from outside, each family in the city would give him a coin of the current trend and a brick, so that the newcomer could easily live for himself
 Manage the location and business
 maharaja agrasen ne tantreey shashan pranali ke pratikaar main ek nayi vyavastha ko janm diya, unhone punah vaidic sanathan arya saskrunti kii mul manyataon ko lagu kar rajya kii punargathan main krishi-vyapaar, udyog, goupalan ke vikaas ke saath-saath naitik mulyon kii punah pratishtha kaa bidaa uthaaya
 In this way, during the reign of Maharaja Agrasen, the Agrodaya Republic made double progress day and night
 kehete hai ki isaki charam smriddhi ke samay vahaan lakhon vyapaaree rahaa karte the
 To the newcomer who came there, the family settled in the state used to give one rupee and a brick as help, thus the newcomer would get millions of rupees and bricks to establish himself so that he could start his business without worry
 Used to do it
 mata mahalakshmi kii krupa se maharaja agrasen ne apane rajya ko 18 ganraajyo main vibhajit kar ek vishaal rajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha, jo inke naam par agrey ganraajya yaa agroday kahalaaya
 
 maharishi garg ne maharaja agrasen ko 18 ganadhipatiyon ke saath 18 yajna karne kaa sankalp karavaaya
 Seventeen-and-a-half gotras of the Agrawans were established in the name of these 18 Ganadhipatis sitting in yagyas
 us samay yagyon main pashubali anivaary rup se di jaati thi
 The priests of the first yajna themselves became Garg sages, initiated the eldest prince Vibhu and chanted them from the Garga gotra
 isi prakaar doosraa yajna gobhil rishi ne karavaaya or dwitiya ganadhipati ko goyal gotra diya
 Third Yagya Gautam Rishi got Goin gotra, in fourth Vatshi got Bansal gotra, in fifth Kaushik Rishi got kansal gotra, in sixth Shandilya Rishi was Singhal gotra, in seventh seventh Mangal Rishi got Mangal gotra, in eighth Jamin got Jindal gotra Tandya Rishi had Tingal gotra, Tenth in Aurvish Rishi, Aryan gotra in Gyarave, Dhaumya Rishi in Gyarawan got Dharan gotra, Mudgal Rishi in twelfth got Mandal gotra, Vasantha Rishi in thirteenth l'gotra, in the fourteenth, Maitreya Rishi gave the Mittal gotra, the fifteenth Kashyap Rishi gave the Kuchal gotra
 17 yajna purna ho chuke the
 At the time when live animals were being sacrificed in the 18th Yajna, Maharaj Agrasen was disgusted by seeing that scene
 unhone yajna ko bich main hi roak diya or kaha ki bhavishya main mere rajya kaa koi bhi vyakti yajna main pashubali nahin degaa, na pashu ko maaregaa, na maans khayega or rajya kaa har vyakti pranimaatr kii raksha karegaa
 Impressed by this incident, he embraced non-violence religion
 idhar antim or athaharwe yajna main yagnacharyo dwaara pashubali ko anivaary bataaya gaya, naa hone par gotra adhuraa rah jayega, aisa kaha gaya, parantu maharaja agrasen ke aadesh par atharaven yajna main nagendra rishi dwaara nangal gotra se abhimantrit kiya
 This gotra is considered half due to lack of animal sacrifices, thus even today 18 and a half seventeen gotras are prevalent in Agarwal society

 Jay Shri! maharaj ne apane rajya ko 18 ganon main vibhajit kar 18 guruon ke naam par 18 gotron kii sthapana kii thi
 Despite each tribe being different, they all remained part of the same family
 isi kaaran agroha bhi sarvangin unnati kar sakaa
 He established a democratic state by taking one representative each from the same 18 counties of the state, whose form is seen in the present democracy system as well
 agarawalon ke 18 gotra nimnlikhit hai - Yagna was considered a sign of prosperity, splendor and prosperity at that time
 maharaj agrasen ne bahut saare yajna kiye
 Once the horse brought to the sacrificial fire was very restless and frightened, he got an idea that what is the benefit of such prosperity which is filled with the blood of silent animals
 usee samay unhone apane mantriyon ke naa chaahane par bhi pashu bali par roak laga di
 That is why even today, the leading society remains away from violence
 maharaj agrasen ke raaj kii vaibhavta se unke padosi raja bahut jalte the
 So they kept attacking Agroha again and again
 baar-baar munhaki khaane ke baavjood unke kaaran rajya main tanaav bana hi rahata tha
 Due to these wars, Agrasenji was disturbed in the work of the welfare of the subjects
 log bhi bhaybheet or roj-roj kii ladai se trast ho gayi the
 Along with this, a huge fire broke out in Agroha once
 us par kisi bhi tarah kaabo naa paaya ja sakaa
 Thousands of people became homeless due to that fire and went to different states of India in search of livelihood
 par unhone apni pahchaan nahin chhodi
 All of them still like to be called Agarwal and maintain their identity with the same 18 gotras
 aaj bhi ve sab maharaj agrasen dwaara nirdeshit maarg kaa anusaran karte hai
 The capital of Maharaja Agrasen was Agroha
 unke shashan main anushaasan kaa paalan hota tha
 The public devoutly performed their duties with freedom
 maharaj agrasen ne 108 varshon tak raaj kiya
 a balanced harmony of tradition and experimentation is seen in the life values he embraced
 unhone ek ore hindu dharm grathon main kshatriya varna ke liye nirdeshit karmkshetra ko sweekaar kiya or duusari ore deshkal ke pariprekshya main nae adarsh sthapit kiye
 There are basically three ideals of his life - democratic governance, economic equality and social equality
 ek nishchit aayu praapt karne ke baad kuladevi mahalakshmi se paraamarsh par ve agrey ganraajya kaa shashan apane jyeshtha putr vibhu ke haathon main saunpkar tapasya karne chale gaye
 Towards the end of his life, Maharaj handed over all the responsibility to his eldest son Vibhu and adopted the Vanaprastha Ashram
 aaj bhi itihaas main maharaj agrasen param pratapi, dharmik, sahishnu, samaajwaad ke prerak mahapurush ke rup main ullekith hai
 Hospitals, schools, stepwells, Dharamshalas etc
 are the basis of Agrasen's life values in the country and these values are the symbol of human faith
 pracheen granthon main varnit agrey hi agarawalon kaa udgam sthaan aaj kaa agroha he
 Maharaja Agrasen Rashtriya Road No 10 is located as a hamlet along the hisar-sirsa bus route in Haryana, 190 km from Delhi and 20 km from Hisar
 jo kabhi maharaja agrasen kii rajdhani rahi, yah nagar aaj ek saadhaaran gram ke rup main sthit he jahaan paanch sau pariwaron kii aabaadi he
 Near it, the remains of the ancient capital Agreh are spread over 650 acres of land as Theh
 jo agrasen maharaj ke agroha nagar ke gaurav purna itihaas ko darshaate hai
 By the way, countless books have been written on Maharaja Agrasen
 suprasiddh lekhak bhaaratendu harishchandra, jo khud bhi agarwal samudaay se the, ne 1871 main "agarawalon kii utpatti" naamak pramanik granth likhaa he, jisamen vistaar se inke bare main bataaya gaya he
 On 24 September 1976, a 25 paise postage stamp was issued by the Government of India in the name of Maharaja Agrasen
 san 1995 main bharat sarkaar ne dakshin korea se 350 karod rupaye main ek vishesh tel vaahak pot kharida, jiskaa naam "maharaja agrasen" rakhaa gaya

 In 2012, the postal stamp was issued at the footsteps of Agrasen of India Post
 bhartiya sangh kaa avibhajya ang hone ke kaaran kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ko rashtriya aarthik vyavastha se pruthak karnaa uchit nahin he
 Nevertheless, Kerala's economic system has its own specialties
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas kii aadharbhoot soochna ke anusaar kerala kii uplabdhiyaan prashansaneey he
 Among the basic elements of human resource development are notable - lower population growth rate than other states of India, higher than national average density, higher age-rate, critical health consciousness, lower infant mortality, higher literacy, primary education Publicity, higher education facilities etc
 are favorable for economic progress
 parantu utpaadan kshetra main mandi, unchi berojgaare dar, badhata bazaar-bhav, nimna pratishirsh aamadani, upabhokta vaad kaa prabhaav aadi ke kaaran kerala kii arth-vyavastha jatil hoti ja rahi he
 Kerala can be compared to South Korea, Malaysia, China etc
 in terms of long age rate
 kintu ve teenon kerala se bhinn desh hai or aarthik vikaas ke path par agrasar hai
 Although according to the indicators of human resource development, Kerala is the leader among Indian states
 bhootkaal main kerala kii prati vyakti aay dar rashtriya aay dar se neeche thi
 While the economic system of Kerala exhibits the qualities of development
 assi ke dashak ke ant main kerala kaa aarthik vikaas ausat rashtriya aarthik vikaas kii dar se aage nikal gaya he
 This development is still going on
 kintu maatr isi se rajya kii sthiti majboot nahin banati
 The adverse effects of globalization have eliminated agriculture and other traditional sectors
 in kshetron main vigat chah - saat varshon se vikaas nahin ho rahaa he
 But now this situation has started changing, which is auspicious
 kerala ko aisa aarthik vikaas praapt karnaa he jo nyayanishth sthai tathaa avilamb ho
 Also, in the policy adopted in the field of development, there is no attempt to reduce government intervention or to reduce social welfare expenditure
 swatantry purv tiruvitankur, kochi, malbar kshetron kaa vikaas aadhunik kerala kii aarthik vyavastha kii prishth bhoomi he
 The geographical and natural features provide the economic system of Kerala with the diversity of natural wealth as well as labor related diversity
 kerala teen pramukh bhugolic kshetron main banta he
 The coastal area is the most densely populated area
 yahan kii urvar mitti, nadi tat kshetra, jhilein aadi machhlee utpaadan, chaaval, nariyal tathaa saag - subjiyon kii kheti ke liye upyukt he
 Coconut, rice, tapioca, betel nut trees, cashew trees, rubber, pepper, ginger etc
 are cultivated in the regions between the mountainous and seaside areas
 purvi pahari kshetra main coffee, chaay, rabad kii kheti aupniveshik kaal se chalati chali aa rahi he
 In the middle of the 20th century, mass communication and establishment took place in the eastern mountainous region, which led to the development of the economic system of Kerala
 kerala main krishi khadyann or niryaat kii janevaali fasalon ke liye bilkul upyukt he
 The export crops have increased due to governance and trade
 kayar udyog, lakdi udyog, khaadya tel utpaadan aadi bhi krishi par aadhaarit hai
 Simultaneously, large industries that make the base of metals, chemicals, engineering etc
 have also started developing
 in kshetron main saarvajanik tathaa nijee pratishthan kaary kar rahe hai
 Coir production, workmanship, handloom etc
 are the traditional occupations of Kerala
 phir bhi yah kahana uchit nahi ki kerala kii aarthik vyavastha maatr krishi adhaarit he
 The notable aspect of Kerala's economic development is neither the agricultural sector considered as the primary sector nor the industry sector with various production-making
 aarthik vikaas kaa mukhya pahalu teesraa kshetra he jise seva - kshetra kaha jaataa he
 Majority of Kerala income and employment is received from here
 kerala praayah sabhi kshetron main bharat ke anya rajyon ke aage batch rahaa he, saadharantah koi bhi rajya pratham, dwitiya or tritiy kshetron ko paar karke hi aarthik vikaas ke ucch sopan par arurh ho saktaa he
 Against this economic principle, by reaching the first area and the second area in the third area, Kerala can take place in front of developed countries in mortality, literacy, woman age etc
 kam pratishirsh aay tathaa unchi unchi berojgaare ko poonji banaakar kerala kaise yah sthiti praapt kar sakaa yah anuttarit prashn sa rahata he
 No other state of India could attract the attention of the world in this way
 aarthik kshetra main hi nahin balki rajnatik, saamaajik evam saanskrithik kshetron main bhi jo vikaas kerala main hua he uski charchaa viksit deshon main hoti rahati he
 The progress of Kerala's economic system in the late 1980s was also discussed abroad with the name Kerala Model
 is udhaaharan ko lekar aaj bahut se prashn uthaaye jate hai
 Many economists doubt its sustainability
 19 veen shatabdi se sarkaar ne ek samaaj kalyaan niti apanaai he or uske karyanvayan ke antargat aadharbhoot suvidhaon ke liye sarkaar jo kharch karti aa rahi he vahi kerala ke saamaajik vikaas kaa mukhya strot he
 Apart from this, the amount of money received from non-resident Kerala from other regions of India and abroad, especially in the Gulf region, is also the reason for this development
 aadhunik kerala kii aarthik vyavastha main apravasi keraliyon kaa mahaan yogadan he
 For the development of the economic system, the budget of 2007 - 2008 presents some working methods
 1
 krishi tathaa paramparaagat kshetron kaa sangrakshan
 2
 To enhance the quality of public services like education, health etc
 3
 ai, tii
 paryaton, lite ejineering aadi kadi pratiyogita vaale kshetron par aadhipaty jamaane kaa prayaas karnaa
 4
 Providing necessary facilities for the above mentioned development areas
 5
 adivasee, dalit, machuaare ityadi virgon kii pichhadi dasha kaa samaadhaan karnaa
 Early implementation of justice towards women
 paryaavaran kii suraksha
 6
 Decentralization of democratic rights and other administrative-reforms
 bhrashtachar kaa unmoolan
 The strong base of the economic system of Kerala are - commercial banks, co-operative banks, currency exchange system, development of traffic, education - progress in the areas of health, powerful labor movement, cooperative movement etc
 jaisaa ki pehle bataaya ja chukaa he ki kerala kii aarthik vyavastha krishi samskruti se seva samskruti kii ore unmukh hoti hui vikaas kar rahi he
 Kerala occupies a prominent place in India's agricultural economy
 kerala ke krishi jivan ko nirdhaarit karanevaale tatv hai : - vishisht prakritik kshetra, vividh prakaar kii mitti or jalwaayu
 The major crops of Kerala are - rice, coconut, various varieties of pulses, rubber, betel nut, cardamom, coffee, tea, cashew, tapyoca, black pepper, ginger, turmeric, cocoa, cloves, nutmeg etc
 yahan par aalu, pyaaj aadi uttar bhartiya fasalein bhi utpann kii jaati hai
 Rubber, coffee, cardamom, tea etc
 are considered as farm crops
 duusari prakaar kii fasalein mukhyatah un krishak pariwaron ke paas he jo krishi ko aajeevika rup main apanaae hue hai
 The agricultural sector of Kerala is facing many crises, including the acute crisis in the production of both rice and coconut
 aaj kerala ko chaaval tathaa subjiyon keliye duusare rajyon par ashrith rahanaa pad rahaa he
 Not only this, the expansion of agricultural land has also decreased
 krishi bhoomi main mitti bharkar zamin banane kaa jo kaal chal rahaa he vah kerala ko gambhir sankat kii ore dhakel rahaa he
 Although they have been made coconut gardens by putting soil in the fields, the production of coconut has not increased
 1992 - 1993 main nariyal kaa utpaadan prati hectares 5843 tha jo 2000 main hectares 5638 ho gaya
 Due to debt load, destruction of crops, fall in prices, life of farmers has become difficult
 atah sarkaar krishi package tathaa rin aashwaasan ayog aadi kaa gathan karke krishi ke punaruddhar kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 The history of Kerala's agriculture begins with the new stone age
 punam krishi jaisi aadim krishi reetiyaan pracheen kaal main prachlit thim
 The tribals had their personal agricultural practices
 pracheen krishi samskruti ke abhinn ang the, krishi ke vibhinn aujaar deshi beej, beej sangrakshan kii paddatiyaan, krishi kaal, bhinn prakaar kii krishi bhumiyaan or krishi se jude reeti-rivaaz, krishi anushthan, krishi - utsav, krishi geet aadi
 Kerala has a large repository of indigenous knowledge related to agriculture
 kerala main vishesh krishi kshetra hai, ye hai - kuttnad, palakkad, kantallur, nelliampati aadi
 Other notable elements in the agriculture sector are small water irrigation schemes, reservoir development schemes, etc
 machhlee paalan or pashu paalan aadi bhi krishi kshetra ke pramukh kaary hai
 In the new stone age man had moved towards agriculture and animal husbandry
 un dinon manushya ke paas do prakaar ke hathiyaar the - pathar se bane farse or ped kii lakdi se bani laathiyaan
 The new stone age must have been agricultural in Kerala as well, because sharp-edged stones have been obtained from some areas of the Sahyadris
 vaynad ke thirunelli tathaa bawalippuzha ke tat par se tathaa pootati naamak sthaan se jo prastar farse praapt hue ve isi prastar yug ke hai
 Animal husbandry and farming by trimming the hillsides of the hills were the lifestyle of the new stone age farmers
 pashchimi ghat ke isi tarah ke sthanon par sambhawatah naveen prastar yugin krishi rahi hogi
 In this era, paddy, fruits, kandamul etc
 would have gained prominence in food
 dakshin bharat main isa se ek hazaar varsh purv lohe kaa upyog shuru hua tha
 The Loh era must have started in Kerala too
 mahaprastar yugin khanan se krishi ke kshetra main hue parivartan bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Iron hoe, shovels, large pottery used for the preservation of seeds have also been found in these excavations
 sanghamakaleen saahitiyik kritiyaan, jo maha prastar yug kii maani jaati hai, utpaadan prakriya ko vistaar se pratipaadit karti hai
 The Sanghamic compositions are related to the production process which also gives details of various tribes
 un dinon krishi ko aajeevika banaanevaale log vellalar kehalaate the
 Vellalars are not considered as distinct caste divisions in Kerala
 yahan krishakon ko kisi jati vishesh varg kaa nahin mana gaya he
 Later, the people of the waiter and ire class also started doing agricultural work
 nadi taton kii urvartaa dekhakar waiter, ir, kurvar aadi log vahaan jaakar bas gayi
 Later, they came to be known as plowlers and pullers
 'pulam' shabd kaa arth bhoomi he
 The agricultural region was called 'mainpulum' and the hilly regions around it where agriculture is not done were called 'vanapulam'
 'menpulam' aadim krishi ke vikaas ko suchit karata tha
 Although Sangham literature provides a detailed description of agriculture, there is no mention of the result of production in them
 yah bhi spasht nahin he ki us kaal kii krishi vishaal aabaadi kaa paalan poshan kar sakati thi ki nahin
 The concept of division of the five 'tinkal' forms of the Sangham period also presents the picture of the ancient farmers - life
 krishi ke itihaas kaa aglaa charan buddha, jain, brahman aadi dharm ke logon ke kerala aagaman ke baad kaa he
 Buddhism inspired agriculture
 jab brahman nadi tat par bas gayi to unhone krishi par adhikaar jamaa liya
 The bulk of the farms came to the villages of Brahmins
 brahmanon kaa khetibari par aadhipaty jamane kaa kaaran unka jyotish gyaan tha jiske aadhaar par unhone krishi kii yojana taiyaar kii or uskaa niyantran bhi apane paas rakhaa
 They established their hold on the land by establishing temples
 is tarah unhone sidhe krishi na karte hue bhi krishi utpaadan par niyantran praapt kar liya
 This also brought about a change in the production system
 ushvar naamak jan, saamaanya vibhaag ke log, anek upavibhaagon main bant gayi
 Karlar, Kutikal, Attiyar became the head sub divisions
 pramukh krishak karalar kahalaane lage
 Due to the name of the temples of agricultural land, the Karlar became subject to the Brahmins
 kheton main rahane waalon ko kutimaa athwa kutiyanma kaha gaya
 Were called the lowest Adiyars
 adianma athwa das varg kaa zamin par koi adhikaar nahin tha
 They were forced to work hard for their masters
 madhyakaalin kerala main pahunche videshi yayawaron ne apane yatraavriton main kalimirch, adarak aadi videshi mudr laane vaali fasalon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Europeans started permanent residence in Kerala in the 17th century
 tab sugandhit masaale kaa vyapaar bhi phala-phula
 In the same era, plantations of favorite crops of foreigners also developed
 18 veen sadi main kaali mirch kaa vyapaar badhaa
 The cultivation of cashew, pineapple, small jackfruit, potato, long banana etc
 was practiced by the Europeans in Kerala
 19 veen sadi main tiruvitankur main kuch sthal saaf kar khetibari shuru kii gayi
 In the same era, agriculture also practiced in the coastal areas
 19 veen shatabdi main british company ne tiruvitankur or vaynad ke pahari ilaakon main coffee, chaay or ilaychi ke bagan banaaye
 Visited indigenous people of British gardens entered the Sahyadris and started agriculture
 19 veen shatabdi ke antim charnon or beesvin shatabdi ke praarambhik charnon main pahari ilaakon kaa bahut bada hissaa baag ban gaya
 Most of the plantations in Wayanad were owned by Jainadhami Gounder
 madhyatiruvitankur ke logon ne bhi vaynad main bagan banaaye
 Gradually the commercial importance of black pepper declined and other things became prominent
 kerala ke audyogic kshetra ke antargat naveen dhang ke bade udyog, madhyam udyog tathaa chote udyog, khaadi gramodyog, kaarigari udyog aadi aate hai
 Coir industry is the major among the traditional industries of Kerala
 kayar ke baad handloom or kaashew kaa sthaan he
 35% of India's coir products and 90% of coir products are from Kerala
 kayar kshetra main paanch lakh shramik kaam karte hai
 Apart from this, there are other 10 lakh people
 lagbhag 2 lakh log handloom udyog main kaam karte hai
 Khaperu, BD, silk production, bamboo, plantation industry etc
 are under the traditional industry
 19 veen shatabdi ke madhya main kerala main aadhunik udyogon kaa aarambh hua
 These were started by British planters and German evangelists
 1859 main alppuzha nagar main james daaraa naamak amiriki ne kerala kii pratham kayar factory sthapit kii
 In 1881 the first textile mill was established in Kollam Nagar
 kokeikkod or palakkad main khaperuon or eenton kii companiyaan sthapit kii gayi
 Kerala had the aforementioned traditional industries at the beginning of the 20th century
 1935 se - 1946 ke bich tiruvitankur main anek udyog vyavsaay shuru hue
 Factories producing Ryons, Titanium Dioxide, Ammonium Sulphate, Caustic Soda etc
 were also opened

 yahi visheshta manushya main aise kaam karti he jiske kaaran vah jivit praani samajha jaataa he
 Man cannot do any of his physical activities unless he has the knowledge that he will be able to do that action
 koi bhi manushya kisi vighatak padaarth athwa ghatana se bachane ke liye apane kisi ang ko tab tak nahin hilaa saktaa, jab tak ki usko yah gyaan na ho ki koi ghaatak padaarth uske saamne he or usase bachane ke liye vah apane angon ko kaam main laa saktaa he
 For example, we can think of a man who is going towards the river
 yadi vah chalate-chalate nadi tak pahunch jaataa he or nadi main ghus jaataa he to vah duubakar mar jayega
 He cannot stop his walk and cannot save himself from entering the river until the knowledge is produced in his consciousness that he has a river and he can walk on land, but cannot walk on water
 can
 manushya kii sabhi kriyaaon par uparyukt niyam lagu hota he chaahe, ye kriyaayein pehle kabhi hui hon athwa bhavishya main kabhi hon
 Human beings can do any work only because of the inspiration arising from consciousness
 chetana or manushya ke charitra main moulik sambandh he
 Consciousness is the special quality that makes a man alive and character is his entire organization through which the reality of his survival is expressed and through which various functions of life are carried out
 kisi manushya kii chetana or charitra keval usee kii vyaktigat sampatti nahin hote
 These are the result of the social process of many days
 prayek vyakti apane vanshanukram ko swayan main prastut karata he
 He finds special types of rites as ancestral property
 vah itihaas ko bhi swayan main nirupit karata he, kyonki usne vibhinn prakaar kii shiksha tathaa prashikshan ko jivan main paaya he
 Apart from this, he also represents other people by himself, because they have had an impact on his life through his example, preaching and oppression
 jab ek baar manushya kii chetana viksit ho jaati he, tab uski prakritik swatantraaa chali jaati he
 Even in such a state, he is inspired by various motivations and inner instincts, but he cannot publish them freely
 vah yaa to unhen isliye sarvatha dabaa detaa he jisase ki samaaj ke duusare logon kii aavashyaktaaon or ichchhaaon main ve baadhak na bane, athwa unhen is prakaar chapet diya jaataa he, yaa kritrim banaaya jaataa he, jisamen unka prakaashan samajavirohi na ho
 In this way, the human consciousness or prudent mind exercises control over his subconscious, or natural, mind
 manushya or pashu main yahi vishesh bhed he
 This type of control is not there in the life of animals, so they do as they want
 manushya chetanayukta praani he, atev koi bhi kriya karne ke pehle vah uske parinaam ke bare main bhalee prakaar soch letaa he
 From the point of view of psychology, consciousness is the element present in human beings due to which he has all kinds of sensations
 chetana ke kaaran hi ham dekhte, sunate, samajhate or anek vishay par chintan karte hai
 Due to this we also feel happiness and sorrow and due to this we make many kinds of decisions and try to get many things
 maanav chetana kii teen visheshtaayen hai
 She is knowledgeable, emotional and functional
 bhartiya darshanikon ne ise sachchidanand rup kaha he
 The views of modern psychologists confirm the said prohibition
 chetana vah tatv he jisamen gyaan kii, bhav kii or vyakti, arthath kriyasheeltaa kii anubhuti he
 When we know a substance, we are aware of its nature, a dear or unpleasant feeling is born towards it and a desire is created towards it, due to which we either bring it closer to us or remove it away from us
 
 chetana ko darshan main swayamprakash tatv mana gaya he
 Psychology has not yet progressed in the form of consciousness
 chetana hi sabhi padaartho ko, jad chetan, sharir man, nirjeev jivit, mastishk snaayu aadi ko banaati he, unka swaroop nirupit karti he
 Then it is indiscriminate to try to explain consciousness through them
 megadugal mahashay ke kathananusaar jis prakaar bhautik vigyaan kii apni hi sochane kii vidhiyaan or vishesh prakaar ke pradutt hai usee prakaar chetana ke vishay main chintan karne kii apni hi vidhiyaan or pradutt hai
 Therefore, the subject of consciousness can neither be thought of by the methods of physics nor can it be used in its work
 phir bhautik vigyaan swayan apni un antim ikaayiyon ke swaroop ke vishay main nishchit mat prakashit nahin kar paaya he jo us vigyaan ke aadhaar hai
 So far, improvisation has been made about matter, power, speed, etc
 abhi tak unke swaroop ke vishay main antim nirnay nahin hua he
 Therefore, it is not rational to expect a final decision about consciousness
 chetana ko achetan tatv ke dwaara samajhaana, arthath usamen kaary-kaaran sambandh jodna sarvatha avivekpurna he
 Psychologists who have tried to explain consciousness as the result of the actions of the root matter, ie those who have considered it to be the result of physical actions, pulsing of nerves, etc
, have eliminated the presence of consciousness
 unhone chetana kii upasthiti ko hi samaapt kar diya he
 This is the result of the contemplation of Pavlaf and Watson sir
 unke kathananusaar man athwa chetana ke vishay main manovigyaan main sochna hi vyarth he
 The subject of psychology should be the visible behavior of man
 chetana ke sharir main sambandh ke vishay main manovaigyanikon ke vibhinn mat hai
 According to some, consciousness is the result of the actions that occur in the large brain of man, that is, the pulsing of some pulse
 yah apane main swatantra koi tatv nahin he
 According to others, consciousness is a self-element and has a relationship with the body, that is, actions in consciousness affect the body
 kabhi-kabhi chetana kii kriyaaon se sharir prabhavit nahin hota or kabhi sharir kii kriyaaon se chetana prabhavit nahin hoti
 According to one belief, the body is just a tool for the functioning of consciousness, which it sometimes uses and never brings
 parantu yadi yantra bighad jaae, athwa tut jaae, to chetana apane kaamon ke liye aapng ho jaati he
 The above opinion has been considered the best in the state of current progress of science by some serious psychological thinkers
 chetana ke teen str maane gaye hai : chetan, avchetan or achetan
 At the conscious level, all the things through which we think, understand and work
 chetana main hi manushya kaa ahambhaav rahata he or yaheen vichaaron kaa sanghathan hota he
 In the subconscious level, there are things whose knowledge we do not know immediately, but can be remembered in time
 achetan str main ve baaten rahati hai jo ham bhul chuke hai or jo hamaare ytn karne par bhi hamen yaad nahin aatin or vishesh prakriya se jinhen yaad karaayaa jaataa he
 The sensations that once remain in consciousness, they sometimes go into the subconscious and unconscious mind
 ye anubhutiyaan sarvatha niskriy nahin hotin, varan maanav ko anjaane hi prabhavit karti rahati hai
 Consciousness develops through interaction with the social environment
 vaataavaran ke prabhaav se manushya naitikta, auchity or vyavahaarakushalata praapt karata he
 This is called development of consciousness
 vikaas kii charam seemaa main chetana nij swatantraaa kii anubhuti karti he
 She can influence and influence social things, but can also separate herself from this effect
 chetana ko is prakaar kii anubhuti ko shuddh chaitanya athwa pramaata, aatma aadi shabdon se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 It has been discussed by scholars like Charles Yung, Spengel, William Brown etc
 ise deshkal kii seemaa ke baahar mana gaya he

 Babu Devkinandan Khatri popularized the words 'tilism', 'aiyyar' and 'aiyyari' among Hindi speakers

 Later, he established a print press in Varanasi and started the Hindi monthly 'sudarshan' in 1900
 devkinandan khatri ji kaa kaashi naresh ishwariprasad narayan singh se bahut acha sambandh tha
 On the basis of this relationship, he took contracts for the forests of Chakia and Naugarh

 Later, when the contracts of the forests were snatched from him, he composed the Chandrakanta novel by mixing his fantasies and the adventures of Aiyari with the backdrop of the same forests, hills and ruins of ancient historical buildings
 babu devkinandan khatri ne jab upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya tha us jamaane main adhiktar log bhi urdu bhashaa bhashi hi the
 In such a situation, Khatri ji's main goal was to create such a way that Devanagari Hindi should be promoted
 yah utana aasaan kaary nahin tha
 But they did it
 chandrakantha upanyaas itnaa lokapriy hua ki jo log hindi likhnaa-padhanaa nahin jaanate the yaa urdudaan the, unhone keval is upanyaas ko padhane ke liye hindi sikhi
 Keeping this popularity in mind, he wrote a second novel "chandrakanta Santi", which was many times more interesting than "chandrakanta", furthering the same story

 The language of these novels is so simple that even the students of fifth grade read them

 == Customer point of view == For the purpose of the customer agreed purpose, the company will do the CSR only for the purpose of commercial purpose
 Most consumers believe that a positive response will be received for companies making donations

 However, environmental efforts are receiving negative views of consumers believing that this will have an impact on customer service

 Clients try to get negative thoughts, because they are considered to be the result of severe customer

 Not all CSR activities are attractive to consumers
 sarv siesaar upkram graahakanna aakarshak naahit
 Initially, CSR emphasized the official behavior of individual firms
 baad main, yah aapurtikarta vyavhaar or upyog karata he jo karne ke liye utpaadon daal rahe the shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya he or kaise ve ke baad ve mulya kho kaa nipataara kiya gaya
 Irresponsible behavior reflected both the misconduct at the firm, but also at its corporate clients
 aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan siesaar sandarbh vichaar karne ke liye vistaar kiya
 Companies need to include social responsibility in their review of component quality
 siesaar ke ek sanghathan ke maanav sansaadhan, vyavsaay vikaas yaa jansampark vibhaag ke bheetar aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he, yaa ek alag ikai ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari yaa nideshak mandal ke liye reporting ho saktaa he
 The purpose of a corporation is to maximize the returns that constitutes socially responsible behavior to its shareholders and to the court within which it operates

 Better government regulation and enforcement, rather than voluntary measures that drive public decision-making and allocation of resources to private bodies, are an alternative to CSR
 haalanki, aalochakon kaa daawa he ki prabhavi siesaar svaichhik anivaary saamaajik jimmedaari ke kaaryakramon viniyamit rup se sarkaar logon kii apni yojanaon or praathamiktaaon ke saath hastkshep sansadhano ke aavanton ko vikrut, or gaiyr jimmedaar nirnyon kii sambhaavna bad jaati hona chahie
 Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies to distract the public from the ethical questions arising from their main functions
 unka tark he ki pratishtha laabh he ki siesaar companiyon praapt drushtikon ke paakhand kaa pradarshan
 Another concern is that sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other harmful business practices
 is tarah ke tambaakoo, sharaab yaa ladaai ke saamaan companiyon ke rup main udyogon ke utpaadon he ki apane upabhoktaaon or / yaa paryaavaran ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Such companies can engage in the same philanthropic activities as those in other industries

 Corporate people have little or no discretion or care or sympathy, it is logical that they are not motivated by any notion of social responsibility and commitment to employees or to the wider public
