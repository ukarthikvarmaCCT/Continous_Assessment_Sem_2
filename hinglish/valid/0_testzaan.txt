 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice

 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarian at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death

 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes

 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature

 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he

 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai

"

" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany

 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate

 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both?

 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time

 It traditionally begins with the school song - satraa varsh kii avasthaa main mehrunnisa kaa vivaah 'alikuli' naamak ek saahsee irani navayuvak se hua tha, jise jahangir ke rajya kaal ke prarambh main sher afakhaan kii oopaadhi or bardwan kii jaagir di gai thi
 In 1607 AD Jahangir's messengers killed Sher Afghan in a battle
 mehrunnisa ko pakad kar dilli laayaa gaya or use badshaah ke shahi haram main bhej diya gaya
 Here she became the hostess of Queen 'salima Begum', the widow of Emperor Akbar
 mehrunnisa ko jahangir ne sarvapratham nauroz tyohaar ke avasar par dekha or uske soundarya par mugdh hokar jahangir ne may, 1611 i
 main usase vivaah kar liya
 After marriage, Jahangir conferred upon him the titles of 'nurmahal' and 'nur Jahan'
 1613 i
 main noorjehan ko ‘pattamahishi’ yaa ‘badshaah begum’ banaaya gay Apart from being an extraordinary beauty, Nur Jahan was also intelligent, modesty and prudent
 uski sahitya, kavita or lalit kalaon main vishesh ruchi thi
 His target distinction was infallible
 1619 i
 main usne ek hi goli se sher ko maar giraaya tha
 Because of all these qualities she had established complete dominion over her husband
 iske falswaroop jahangir ke shashan kaa samast bhaar usee par aa padaa tha
 Her name also began to be dug on the coins and she started to court in the palace itself
 uske pita etmaduddola or bhai aasaf khaan ko mogul darbar main ucch pad pradaan kiya gaya tha or uski bhatiji kaa vivaah, jo aage chalakar mumtaz ke naam se prasiddh hui, shahjahan se ho gaya
 She married her daughter, born to the first husband, to Jahangir's youngest son Shaharyar, and because she had no children from Jahangir, she wanted Shaharyar to sit on the throne after Jahangir
 noorjehan ke ye sabhi kaary uski kootneeti kaa hi ek hissaa the
 By the end of 1620 AD, Nur Jahan's relations with Khurram were not good, because by now Nur Jahan had realized that his influence on the functions of governance would be lessened when Shah Jahan became king
 isliye noorjehan ne jahangir ke duusare putr ‘shehryaar’ ko mahatv dena prarambh kar kiya
 Since Shaharyar was of short age and weak character, Nur Jahan's influence on his becoming emperor would have continued in the works of governance as before
 is kaaran se sher afakhaan se utpann apni putree 'ladli begum' kii shaadi 1620 i
 main shehryaar se kar use 8000 / 4000 kaa mansab pradaan kiya
 When Shah Jahan realized that Nur Jahan wanted to reduce his influence, he revolted in the Deccan in 1623, disobeying Jahangir's order to invade Kandahar fort and win it
 
 uske vidroh ko dabaane ke liye noorjehan ne aasaf khaan ko na bhej kar mahavat khaan ko shahzada parvaiz ke netritv main bheja
 Both of them successfully crushed Shah Jahan's rebellion
 shahjahan ne pita jahangir ke samaksh atsamarpan kar diya or use kshamaa mil gai
 As a surety, two sons of Shah Jahan, Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb, were kept in the court as hostages
 1625 i
 tak shahjahan kaa vidroh purnatah shant ho gaya
 Nur Jahan got jealous of Mahavat Khan who played an important role in suppressing Shah Jahan's rebellion
 noorjehan ko iskaa ahsaas tha, ki mahavat khaan un logon main se he, jinhen shashan ke kaaryon main meraa prabhutv sweekaar nahin he
 Nur Jahan was also threatened by the proximity of Mahavat Khan and Shahzada Parvez
 atah uske prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye noorjehan ne use bengal jane evam yuddh ke samay luute gayi dhan kaa hisaab dene ko kaha
 Apart from these reasons, there were other reasons as well, due to which, feeling insulted, Mahavat Khan revolted and captured Emperor Jahangir going to Kabul on the banks of river Jhelum in 1626 AD
 noorjehan evam uske bhai aasaf khaan ko bhi bandi bana liya
 Even in prison, Mahavat Khan did not think of loyalty and respect for Jahangir
 rohtas main noorjehan evam jahangir ne kootneeti ke dwaara apane ko mahavat khaan ke prabhaav se mukt kar liya
 Mahavat Khan ran towards 'thatta' for his protection
 28 oktober, 1626 ko parvej kii mrityu ke baad ek tarah se mahavat khaan kamazor ho gaya or vah shahjahan kii seva main chalaa gaya
 During Jahangir's life, Nur Jahan was omnipotent, but after Jahangir's death in 1627, his political sovereignty was destroyed
 noorjehan kii mrityu 1645 i

 He spent the rest of his life in Lahore till his death

 These include a variety of typing, a variety of keyboards and software
 maikenical tiperiter par hindi main tip karne ke liye remington keyboard leout kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This is a very difficult layout, because different keys have to be memorized for each icon, like a computer, conjuncts etc
 cannot be made by combining multiple keys
 parantu maikenical yukti hone ke kaaran tiperiter par ekmaatr yahi leout sambhav he
 At present, Hindi typing has been replaced by Hindi typing on computer by typewriters and its usage is rarely seen
 computer par typing do prakaar kii hoti he- This method was used before the introduction of Unicode system on computer
 isamen puraane samay ke hindi font prayog kiye jate the
 This typing is used only in printing operations

 Here the knowledge of CP is a personal illusion, it occurs at the level of phenomena
 On the other hand, considering CP as CP is a collective illusion, this is the level of behavior, it is called a fundamentalism
 These two types of illusions are inexplicable here
