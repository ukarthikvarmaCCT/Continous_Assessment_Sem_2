 But Karna was born with the life of the vegetation of the desert, which absorb moisture even from the sand
 gyaan par ekadhikaar kii kapat krida kaa pratirodh kishor karn parashuram ke samaksh apane vaastavik parichay ko gopan rakhkar karata he
 This 'untruth' of Kishore Karna was insignificant compared to the cruel truth of the prevailing system, yet Karna became a part of the curse

 Similarly, due to their personal qualities, the post which they are entitled to will not be able to obstruct it
 karn-charit kaa uddhaar ek tarah se nayi bhaavana kii sthapana kaa hi prayaas he
 Karna's Dalit self-assertion challenges the root norms of the entire system on the pretext of challenging Arjuna in puberty - karn ke jaateey parichay kii aad main kripacharya dwaara jab vaiyaktikta ke udghosh ke swar ko shamit karne kaa punah prayaas hota he to karn kaa sanchit aakrosh foot padataa he- Dinkar considered the sympathy of the whole world to be a part of his heart
 unheen ke shabdon main dekhie -‘‘bharat kaa man rashtriya kam, antararashtriya adhik rahaa he
 Nevertheless, to get rid of slavery, we accepted the national adjective, only in the sense that without the awakening of nationalism, the end of slavery is impossible

 karn aise virale atmbaliyon main se ek tha
 Even after sensing the treacherous intent of Devraj Indra, he says: karn kaa yah jaanboojhkar ‘chalaa janaa’ uske charitra ko or ujjwal banaata he
 This valor of Karna also changes Indra's heart and he is forced to give Karna a fire
 karn-kunti prasang main dinakar ne karn ko upekshit putr kii bhoomika main rakhaa he
 Due to the harsh neglect of the mother, Karna is forced to live a stubborn life
 atev is prasang main mata dwaara apratyaashit sneh ke pradarshan par uskaa sanchit vikshobh foot padataa he
 But Karna is by nature a benevolent person whose love is on everyone and whose compassion is towards everyone
 phir janani ke prati vah kab tak kathor rah saktaa tha
 Karna decides to not kill all the brothers except Arjuna in the war, meaning subsistence of friend-religion
 daan ke atirikt kritagyata bhi shreshth purushon main paayi jaati he
 The voluntary assistance also becomes invaluable if done at the right time, then Duryodhana declared him the king of Anga Pradesh in order to revive Karna, who was stunned by the sharp arrows of satire in Rangbhoomi
 kritagyata or mitra ke prati prem ke vasheebhoot hokar hi karn kunti ke aagrah ko thukraata hua kahata he - Despite being with Duryodhana, perhaps due to being driven by a sense of duty of gratitude, Karna's personality does not fade even a little
 draupadi kaa chiraharan hi ek aisa prasang he jahaan karn kaa aahat abhimaan use nari kii asmita kii raksha ke liye virodh kaa swar bhi mukherit nahin karne detaa
 Dinkar has tried to wash away the stigma by expressing remorse to Karna in the context of the karna-arjuna war
 draupadi cheer haran ke prasang ko chhod diya jaye to karn kaa charitra sarvatha nishkalank he
 By the time Karna became the commander in the war, the war had become disgusting with the encroachment of all dignities, but Karna tries to establish dignity again
 nagvansha ke sarp ashwasen ke uske tunir par savaar ho arjuna ko dansane dene ke aagrah ko asweekaar karata hua vah kahata he - Karna did not take shelter of unrighteousness, but Arjuna, listening to the ethic Krishna said, must have taken shelter of unrighteousness
 karn ke rath kaa pahiyaa pank main fas gaya or nihshastr, pahiyaa nikaalte karn ko arjuna ne apane baanon se bindh daalaa
 The sun in Karna's life set in this way, but the brilliance of his glory will continue to ring the society for eternity to narrate the majesty of the individual

 == adarsh sthal ==fil;fif; ;ji The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory

 This is the main religion of Islam
 ise aqidah kehete hai: Muslims believe in a single God, whom they call Allah
 akeshwarwad ko arabi main tauhid kehete hai, jo shabd vaahid se aata he jiskaa arth he ek
 In Islam, God is considered above human understanding
 musalamaanon se ishvar kii kalpana karne ke bajaay uski prarthana or jai jayakaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 According to Muslims, God is unique: there is no one like him
 islam main ishwar kii ek vilakshan avadharana par jor diya gaya he
 Together, it is believed that his entire imagination is not in man's control
 kaho: he ishwar ek or anupam
 God is eternal, living forever forever
 uski na koi aulad he na vah khud kisi kii aulad he
 And no one else like that
 " islam ke anusaar ishwar ne dharti par manushya ke maargdarshan ke liye samay samay par kisi vyakti ko apana doot banaaya
 These messengers were also from the human race and called people towards God
 ishwar in duuton se vibhinn roopon se sampark rakhte the
 These are called prophets in Islam
 jin nabiyon ko ishvar ne swayan shaastra yaa dharm pustaken pradaan kin unhen rasul kehete hai
 Muhammad Sahib was also a part of this episode
 unako jo dharmik pustak pradaan kii gayi uskaa naam quran he
 The Quran describes 25 other prophets of God
 swayan quran ke anusaar ishwar ne in nabiyon ke alaava dharti par or bhi kai nabi bheje hai jinka varnan quran main nahin he
 All Muslims accept the legitimacy of all the prophets sent by God and most Muslims consider Muhammad Saheb as the last prophet of God
 ahmadiyya samudaay ke log mohammad sahab ko antim nabi nahin maanate hai or swayan ko islam kaa anuyaayi bhi kehete hai
 According to the Supreme Court of India, he is considered a Muslim in India
 kai anya pratishthit musalmaan vidwaan samay samay par pehle bhi mohammad sahab ke antim nabi hone par sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 All religious books provided by God to the Rasools are valid for Muslims
 musalamanon ke anusaar quran ishwar dwaara manushya ko pradaan kii gayi antim dharmik pustak he
 Four more books are discussed in the Quran: musalmaan yah samajhate hai ki isaayiyon or yahudiyon ne apni pustakon ke sandashon main badlaav kar diye hai
 He does not deny the possibility of having other religious books apart from these four
 musalmaan farishton ke astitv ko maanate hai
 According to him, the angels themselves have no will and only obey the command of God
 vah khalis roshni se baniin hooi amoort or nirdosh hastiyon hai jo ki na mard hai na aurat balki insaan se har lihaaz se alag hai
 Although there are uncountable angels, four angels influence in the Quran: madhya asia ke anya dharmon kii tarah islam main bhi qayaamat kaa din mana jaataa he
 According to this, God will end the world one day
 yah din kab aayegaa isaki sahi jaankaree keval ishwar ko hi he
 This is called the Day of Muslim Doom
 islam main shaareerik rup se sabhi mare hue logon kaa us din ji uthne par bahut jor diya gaya he
 On that day every human will be rewarded for his good and bad deeds
 islam main hindu mat kii tarah samay ke paripatr hone kii avadharana nahin he
 The world will not be created again after the Day of Doom
 musalmaan taqadir ko maanate hai
 The meaning of fate is for them that God knows all about the past, present and future
 koi bhi chiz uski anumati ke bina nahin ho sakati he
 Man has the freedom to live his own will, but his permission has also been given to him by God
 islam ke anusaar manushya apane kukarmon ke liye swayan jimmedaar is liye he kyonki unhen karne yaa na karne kaa nirnay ishwar manushya ko swayan hi lene detaa he
 God also has prior knowledge of his misdeeds
 shookar influenza, jise ech1en1 yaa swine flu bhi kehete hai, vibhinn shookar influenza vishaanuon main se kisi ek ke dwaara failaayaa gaya sankraman he
 The swine influenza virus is any strain of influenza virus that is responsible for endemic pigs
 2009 tak gyaat es
ai
ve upabhedon main influenza si or influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1, ech1en2, ech3en1, ech3en2 or ech2en3 shaamil hai
 This type of influenza also affects humans and birds
 shookar influenza vishaanu kaa duniya bhar ke suaro main paaya janaa aam he
 The transmission of this virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always cause human influenza, often producing only antibodies against it in the blood
 yadi iskaa sancharan, maanav influenza kaa kaaran banataa he, tab ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Individuals who are regularly exposed to pigs are at greater risk of infection with the flu
 yadi ek sankramit suar kaa maance thik se pakaaya jaye to iske seven se sankraman kaa koi khatra nahin hota
 In the mid-20th century, it became possible to identify subtypes of influenza, which led to an accurate diagnosis of its transmission in humans
 tab se aise keval 50 sancharanon kii pushti kii gai he
 These strains of swine influenza rarely transmit from one human to another
 maanav main zunotic shookar influenza ke lakshan aam influenza ke lakshanon ke samaan hi hote hai, jaise thand laganaa, bukhaar, gale main karaash, khaansi, mansapeshiyon main dard, tej sir dard, kamajori or saamaanya bechaini
 Influenza infection in pigs can cause fever, lethargy, sneeze, cough, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite
 kuch maamalon main yah sankraman garbhpaat kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Although death usually occurs in only 1–4% of cases
 yah sankraman boar kaa vajan gata or vikaas ko prabhavit kar saktaa he jo inke palko ke aarthik nuksaan kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 The weight of an infected pig can decrease from 5 to 6 kg over a period of 3 to 4 weeks
 manushyon main shookar influenza kaa mukhya lakshan hai: - In some cases, the transmission of the swine influenza virus is possible from pigs directly to humans, in which case it is called zoonotic swine influenza
 1958 se lekar abhi tak aise sirf 50 maamle hi report huye hai, jiname se bhi sirf 6 vyakti hi mrityu kaa grass bane hai
 Of these six people, one was a pregnant woman, one had leukemia, one was suffering from Hodgkin disease and two were already healthy
 bhale hi yah pratyaksh maamle bahut kam lagen par vaastavik sankraman kii sahi dar isse kahin adhik ho sakati he, kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon main yah saamaanya rog hi prathit hota he or is kaaran ise report hi nahin kiya jaataa
 Two of the three lineage influenza viruses responsible for human influenza can also spread influenza to pigs, of which influenza a is very common but influenza c is rarely found
 abhi tak influenza bi ko siiron main nahin dekha gaya he
 The strains found in humans and pigs within influenza a and influenza c differ, although re-segregation has resulted in large-scale gene transfer across strains whether present in pigs, birds, or human species
 influenza si vishaanu, maanav or siiron donon ko sankramit karata he lekin iskaa sankraman pakshiyon main nahin hota
 In the past too, it has been transmitted between pigs and humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, influenza si ke kaaran japan or california main bacchon ke bich influenza kaa kam prabhavi prakaar failaa tha
 Influenza c has not been able to cause epidemics in humans due to its limited heterogeneous range and lack of genetic diversity
 shookar influenza, influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1,ech1en2,ech3en1,ech3en2, or ech2en3
 ke kaaran hota he
 Among pigs worldwide, the three influenza a virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common
 ech1en1 spanish flu se aayaa, jo 1918 or 1919 ke dauraan faili ek mahamari thi jisase lagbhag 5 karod log maare gaye the
 The virus that came from Spanish flu was present in pigs
 iskaa sanchalan 20 veen sadi ke dauraan manushyon main bhi hua, yadhyapi yah varsh ke us samay hota he jab prativarsh hone vaali mahamariyaan failati hai, jisase 'saamaanya' influenza or shookar influenza main antar kar paanaa kathin he
 However, cases of infection from pigs to humans are rare and 12 cases have been reported in the US since 2005
 yahe == manushyon main shookar influenza yah shookar ke dwaara manushyon main failaa
 The disease spreads more in the cold
 din or raat kaa taapmaana yadi 25C se upar ho to iske vishaanu mar jate hai
 Relationship marketing rishta vipanan pehla graahak banaae rakhane or santushti par jor detii he, jo pratyaksh pratikriya vipanan abhiyaanon se viksit vipanan kaa ek rup he, bajaay bikri lenden par ek pramukh dhyaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya tha
 As a practice, relationship marketing differs from other forms of marketing in that it recognizes the long-term importance of customer relationships and extends communication beyond the intrusive advertising and sales promotion message
 internet or mobile manchon ke vikaas ke saath, rishta vipanan viksit or praudyogiki or sahyogi or saamaajik sanchaar channel kholta ke rup main aage badhane ke liye jari rakhaa he
 It goes beyond simple demographic and customer service data to include tools for managing relationships with customers
 rishta vipanan bheetar kaa vipanan prayaason, jansampark, saamaajik media or anuprayog vikaas shaamil karne ke liye faili hui he
 Relationship marketing refers to an arrangement where both buyer and seller are interested in providing a more satisfactory exchange
 yah drushtikon aspasht ek or adhik samgr, vyaktigat kharid pradaan karke adhik sachcha or amir sampark banane ke liye ek graahak ke saath saadhaaran post kharid-vinimay prakriya ke paar karne kii koshish karata he, or majboot sambandhon ko banane ke liye anubhav kaa upyog karata he
 From a social anthropological perspective we can interpret relationship marketing principles and practices as barter that facilitate gift exchange facilities
 aisa lagata he ki bazaar-boojhkar yaa sahaj jaan yukt-jate hai vinimay kii 'purv' aadhunik roopon main nihit shakti ko pahchaanane or iskaa istemaal karne ke liye shuru kar diya he
 This particular perspective on marketing opens fertile ground for future research, where marketing theory and practice can greatly benefit from in-depth research of gift exchange governing principles
 liyaam alvi ke anusaar, rishta vipanan se chunane ke liye graahakon ke liye pratispardhi utpaada vikalp hai jab lagu kiya ja saktaa he; or utpaada yaa seva ke liye chal rahe ek or aavadhik ichha nahin he jab
 It was found for companies to sell products of relatively low value to the public of more profitable customers, as modern consumer marketing did in the 1960s and 1970s
 dashakon ke prayaas ke vipanan kii gunjaaish he, in prayaason main se ek hone rishta vipanan vyapak banane ke liye banaaya gaya he
 Of course, customer value has been greatly enriched by these contributions
 rishta vipanan ke abhyaas par nazar rakhane or prayek graahak kii variyataon ko, gatividhiyon, swaad, pasand, naapsand, or shikayaton ke vishleshan kii anumati dete hai ki graahak sambandh prabandhan software kii kai pidiyon dwaara suvidha di gai he
 For example, a motor vehicle manufacturer retains a database of how and when customers buy their products, they have options to choose, they provide one-to-one marketing, like purchase finance etc
 And a powerful position to develop product benefits rishta vipanan bhi dridhtaa se punarrachana se prabhavit kar diya gaya he
 According to reengineering theory, organizations should be structured according to tasks rather than complete tasks and processes
 yahi kaaran he, paar kaaryaatmak tiimon ko samaapt karne ke liye shuruyaat he, bajaay kaam duusare ke liye ek kaary vibhaag se janaa hone se, ek puri prakriya ke liye jimmedaar hona chahie he
 Traditional marketing is said to use the functional department approach

 gordon ke anusaar, vipanan mishran drushtikon bhi kai udyogon main graahak sambandhon kaa akalan karne or vikaas ke liye ek prayog karne yogya dhaancha pradaan karne ke liye or dhyaan dene ke liye samay ke saath graahakon, rishte or baatcheet par he jahaan vaikalpik model ke vipanan ke sambandh dwaara pratisthapit kiya janaa chahie simit he, balki bazaar or utpaadon kii tulana main
 Relationship marketing only relies on the acquisition of communication and consumer needs in a mutually beneficial exchange involving existing customers, typically allowing for contact with customers through an "opt-in" system
 rishta vipanan kaa ek mahatvapurn siddhant is takanic ko ab nae graahakon ko or avasaron santulan ke ek saadhan ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he, ek parsparik rup se laabhprad sambandhon ke madhyam se pratispardhi companiyon ke un logon ke upar aavashyaktaaon ko santoshjanak dwaara graahakon purvasthitv se doharaaya vyapaar ko sunishchit karne ke liye alag-alag matlab he or prathaon ke madhyam se graahakon kii avdhaaran he laabh ko adhiktam or nae graahakon kii keemat par the puraane pratyaksh vipanan unmukh kaarobaar main phayda hua yaa puraane graahakon ke nuksaan ke saath hui, jisamen "vyapaar ke tapakaaya baaltee siddhant" kaa pratikaar karne kaa ek saadhan ke rup main vartmaan or maujuuda graahakon ke saath
 This process of "churning" lead generation through all or new customers requires more investment as both direct and relationship management retain the majority of customers, at least financially viable
 rishta vipanan or paaramparik vipanan paraspar anany nahin hai or un donon ke bich ek sangharsh ke liye koi jarurat nahin he
 According to the still position variable of a relationship-oriented market, there is option at the level of practice
 zyaadaatar companiyon ke utpaadon or sevaaon ke apane portpholio match ke liye do drushtikon mishran
 Almost all products have a service component to them and this service component has grown in recent decades
 rishta vipanan bhi yah aantarik vipanan kahata he, yaa sanghathan ke bheetar hi ek vipanan unmukhikaran kaa upyog kya jor diya he
 This relationship is what many of marketing's "internal customers" call and claimed characteristics like determined collaboration, loyalty and trust
 is siddhant ke anusaar, company main har karmchaaree, team yaa vibhaag kii ek saplir or sevaaon or utpaadon kii ek graahak ek saath he
 An employee receives a service at a point in the value chain and then provides a service to another employee further down the value chain
 aantarik vipanan prabhavi he, to har karmchaaree donon pradaan karte hai or se or anya karmchaariyon ke liye asaadhaaran seva praapt hoga
 Christopher, Payne and Bultine go on from Cranfield University
 unhone kaha ki ve rishta vipanan ke liye kendriya hai kaa daawa he jo chah bazaaron kii pahchaan
 They are: internal markets, recruitment markets in supplier markets, referral markets, impact markets, and customer markets

 shakti-santulan kaa siddhanth yah maanata he ki koi raashtra tab adhik surakshit hota he jab sainik kshamta is prakaar banty hui ho ki koi akelaa rajya itnaa shaktishaalee na ho ki vah akele anya rajyon ko dabaa de
 The concept of balance of power has been prevalent in the international stage since about the 15th century
 shaayad isiilie kuch lekhak ise antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa buniyadi siddhanth to kuch ise saarvajanik siddhanth yaa raajnneeti ke moulik siddhanth kii sangya dete hai
 In general terms, balance of power means when one state / group of states increases its power relative to another state / group of states so that it becomes equivalent to it
 parantu is dharna kii paribhaasha ko lekar vidyaman ekamat nahin hai
 Perhaps this is why Inins L
 Claude says that this is a concept that does not have a definition problem but rather that it has many definitions
 in paribhaashaon se pehle yah bataanaa bhi aavashyak he ki yah do prakaar kii hoti hai -saral evam jatil
 Simple or simple power balance occurs when the comparison is directly between two nations or between two nations
 lekin yadi yah santulan do samudaayon ke paraspar tathaa inamen sammilit samudaayon main aantarik rup main bhi ho tab yah jatil santulan kehalaata he
 In this context, scholars have given various definitions which are as follows- prayek raashtra yathasthiti ko banaaye rakhane athwa parivartit karne ke liye duusare raashton kii apeksha adhik shakti praapt karne kii aakanksha rakhata he
 As a result, the structure required is called balance of power
 shakti santulan vah samyavastha yaa antarrashtriya sambandh main kuch maatra main sthirataa yaa sthayitv he, jo rajyon ke bich maitra-sandhiyon yaa anya duusare sadhano kii madad se praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 The balance of power is the system under which every state constantly tries to maintain the belief that if states try aggression they will have to resist a group of invincible other nations
 shakti santulan se abhipraay raashton ke pariwaron ke sadasyon ke bich shakti kii nyaaypurna samyavastha se he jo kisi raashtra ko itnaa shaktishaalee hone se roktaa he taaki vah duusare raashtra par apni ichha lad na sake
 Thus, the balance of power has been seen by scholars from different countries
 koi ise shakti ke vitaran ke rup main dekhte hai to koi ise samoohon ke bich samyavastha ke rup main, koi ise sthayitv ke rup main, to koi ise yuddh va asthirataa ke rup main
 This is to say that these definitions lack consensus
 shaayad yah isliye hai ki shakti santulan ke anek arth / prayog hai jis vajah se yah bhranti bani hui he
 Mainly, the balance of power is used in four contexts - quinci rhit ke anusaar shakti santulan kaa siddhanth paanch manyataon par aadhaarit he- The balance of power has the following characteristics: saamaanya rup se yah yathasthiti banaae rakhane kii niti he, parantu vastav main yah hameshaa gatisheel va parivartaneey hoti he
 It is not a divine boon but it is the result of continuous human intervention
 yah vyaktiparak va vastunishth donon prakaar se paribhaashit hota he
 Historians always objectively assess it, while diplomats always subjectively analyze it
 yadhyapi yah shaanti sthapit karne kaa tantra he, parantu yah mushkil se hi kabhi shaanti sthapit karata he
 It is mainly a game of superpowers
 chote raashtra to maatra darshak kii bhoomika hi nibhaate hai
 An operator is needed for its correct operation which is absent in today's era
 yah samyavastha ke aadhaar par shaktiyon kaa samaan vitaran karata he
 But it is known from looking at the history of international politics that there has never been such a time
 shakti santulan kii vyavastha antarrashtriya raajnneeti main shaayad hi dashshtigochar ho, kyonki shakti tatv kaa maapna va sthir kar paanaa sambhav nahin he
 www
ncert
com shakti santulan kii sthapana hetu nimnlikhit tareekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he- Sometimes big powers divide the land of small states for mutual power balance
 yah seemaa parivartan is aadhaar par kiya jaataa he ki aapasi shaktiyon main se koi bhi ek duusare se shaktishaalee na ban jaae
 In 1713, after the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain's land was divided between Bourbon and Hapsburg after the Treaty of Utrecht
 isi prakaar poland ko teen baar main is prakaar vibhajit kiya gaya ki shakti santulan na bigade
 Similarly, in the 18th and 19th centuries, various treaties were made keeping this view in mind
 maitri sandhiyaan bhi shakti santulan kaa pramukh saadhan rahi he
 But when a nation increases its power through Maitra treaties, then other states also become apprehensive and start making treaties with each other
 is kram kaa ant vishwa ke sabhi raashton dwaara virdohi guton main sangathit hokar hota he
 This type of Maitra treaties and the era of Maitra treaties are commonly seen in the politics of Europe
 udhaahranswaroop 1882 ke trirashtriya sandhi ke gathan ke virodh swaroop anya rashtron ke bich bhi virdohi trirashtriya maitri sandhiyon par sahmati hui taaki europe kii raajnneeti main santulan banaaya ja sake
 Similar examples emerged in the form of alliances established between the superpowers after World War II
 shastreekaran shakti kaa pratyaksh evam agratam rup he
 That is why among the states, especially from their rival, there is a competition to store weapons
 is sanchay se unki sainya shakti kaa vikaas hota he tathaa apane virodhiyon par dabaav badhaane ke kaam aata he
 But the other nation or group of states also does not want to be left behind, so both want to balance each other
 udhaahranswaroop, shityudh yug main purv soviet sangh va america ke bich shastreekaran hi donon dwaara ek duusare ko santulit karne kaa madhyam rahaa he
 Along with international political armament, disarmament also sometimes works to balance between the powers
 jab shastreekaran ek charam seemaa ke baad aage badhanaa sambhav na rah sake tab shaktiyaan nirastrikaran kii taraf kadam badhaati he
 As an example, the Salt-1 Salt-2 Start-1 and Start-2 INF Treaty etc
 agreements between the two superpowers are proof of this
 anya raashton ke bich bhi vartmaan samay main shastrakaran se tang aakar vishwasaneeyata badhaane vaale kadamon kaa uthaaya janaa iskaa pramaan he
 Many times the two powers maintain a mutual balance by avoiding any direct confrontation and keeping any one state at the center
 atah aisa kamjor va tatasth rajya hameshaa do badi takaton ke bich yuddh kii sambhaavnaaen tali rahane ke saath-saath shakti santulan bhi bana rahata he
 For example, for a long time Poland remained an intermediate state between Russia and Germany
 afghanistan, rus va england ke bich is sthiti main kaaphi der tak rahaa
 Sometimes two non-allies divide the intermediate region equally
 aisi sthiti main madhyavarti kshetron kaa prabhaav nunatam ho jaataa he
 For example, the partition of Germany, Korea, indo-china
 vartmaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ye kshetra samaapt praaia ho gayi hai
 Therefore, their effect has also become negligible for the balance of power
 hastkshep kii niti hameshaa shaktishaalee raashton dwaara duusare ke maamle main dakhlandaji karke apane prabhaav ko badhaane se he
 Its purpose is in the form of continuation or change of a regime there by the big nation
 is saadhan ke madhyam se shakti santulan banaaye rakhane kaa prayaas hota he
 It was used extensively by both the superpowers during the Cold War period
 purv soviet sangh ne jahaan hungary, checkoslovakia va afghanistan main hastkshep kiya, vahiin america ne grrenada, cuba, nikaragua, korea, iraq, afghanistan aadi main hastkshep kiya he
 The policy of balancing laissez-faire has generally been adopted by smaller nations
 isse chote rajyon dwaara tatastha ke rup main apanaaya gaya he
 In some circumstances, even large nations have resorted to it
 zyaadaatar asia, africa evam latin america deshon ne gut nirpekshata kii niti apanaakar ahastkshep niti kaa paalan kiya he
 Due to this, attempts to not fight or keep it limited or to give it its local form etc
 come under this
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti main badi takaton dwaara foot daalo, raaj karo kii niti kaa bhi anusaran kiya he
 Even by dividing the states into two opposing factions, the powers establish the balance of power in that region
 yah niti mukhya rup se britain dwaara apane samrajya ko ekikrut rakhane hetu kaaphi baar prayog kii gai
 The indo-pak partition of 1947 is a strong example of this
 is niti ke antargat apane pratidwandiyon ko kamjor karke santulan banane kaa prayaas kiye jate rahe hai
 In the Cold War period, the superpowers have also followed this type of policy in non-aligned countries
 yadi shakti santulan kaa moolyankan karen to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki is tareeke se shakti par purna simaaen to na lag saki
 Yes, to some extent this theory was successful in its objectives
 is siddhanth ke purna rup se shakti ke vikaas par ankush na laga paane ke nimnlikhit kaaran rahe- It is clear from the above thoughts that this principle is not fully capable of expanding power or preventing power struggle
 lekin iske madhyam se aanshik safalataa avashya milti he, kyonki - pratham, chote rajya apni suraksha aashwast kar sakate hai
 Second, it will also curb the establishment of the hegemony of a large power
 tritiy, yah yudhon ko bhi taalane main sakasham he
 Fourth, in the absence of any central authority over sovereign states, international law is also possible only with the balance of power
 atah yah kuch had tak shakti ke nirankush yaa aadhipaty sthapit karne kii sambhaawanaaon ko aanshik rup main rokane main sakasham he

 "galaksi" shabd kaa mul unani bhashaa kaa "gaala" shabd he, jiskaa arth bhi doodh hota he
