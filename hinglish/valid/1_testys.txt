 Oops! 


 i Did It Again and subsequent albums saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers and reaching "a combination of Bubblegum, Urban Soul, and Raga"
 Her third album, Brittany, originated from the conceit of teenage pop, "in rhythmic and rhythmic form 


 more intense, tougher than before
 In what used to be an irrepressibly frothy, there's some disco tenacity that spears daring Self-determination that helps sell hooks who, by and large, are already more attractive than the ones who populated their last two albums
 " Her vocals have also been criticized for often contrasting her with her pop rival, Christina Aguilera
 samalochak alan ribal ne sarkas main nirmit digital prabhaav or robot ke prabhaav par uske atinirbharta kaa uphaas kiya he
 “she has never been a strong singer
 

" ribal likhte hai, "kya vah in gaanon ko anaavrutt vyavasthaaon or kisi mukhar prabhaav-hinata ke saath sambhaal sakegi? isse bhi mahatvapurn baat, kya uske aise pradarshan yaa gane ko koi sunanaa chahega? kya isse koi fark padataa he? nahin
 dhyaan abhi bhi mul-vastu par tikaa hua he
 " uske chhavi or vyaktitv bhi praayah christina aguilera ke vipareet he
 David Brown of Entertainment Weekly has observed that "christina Aguilera shows skin and navel but in her music and behavior, she is more inclined not to offend anyone - she's a good girl who is only bad She plays haalanki, spirs acha abhinay karne vaali ek buree ladki maaloom padati he
 

 Spears's gimmicky and melodious voice is far less interesting than the settings, but nonetheless the tenderness of Aguilera's stubborn vocal gymnastics actually works as a relief
 iske vipareet, olmusic ne tipanni kiya he: "apane mitra christina aguilera kii tarah, britaini paardarshee kaamuktha or nite klbon kii tej awaz ke saath paripakvata ko samikrut kar detii he
 

while Christina seems like a born skank, Britney is the girl next door to the cutting loos in college, she drinks so casually and smokes and dances and has little intercourse
 Also, it seems that she can satisfy herself only in this first time
 " slant magazine ke saal singhmaani ne note kiya he ki "aguilera or spirs ke bich kii asamanta ko sirf unqi awaajon kii lay or sargam seemaa se nahin mapa ja saktaa he
 

 Popularity has never reached the pitch of Britney's exaggeration
 yah vyapak rup se bataaya gaya he ki anya nrity-unmukh pop star kii tarah, spirs bhi sangeet samaaroh main lip-sinks karti he
 Writer Gary Giddins, in his book Natural Selection: Gary Giddins on Comedy, Film, Music, and Books, wrote that "artists who move their lips like a machine include Britney Spears, Luciano Pavarotti, Shania Twain, Beyoncé and Madonna" 
 " da balteemor san ke rashod di
 olison ne dekha he: "kai pop staron 


 ko lagata he ki kanth swar ko sudhaarney ke alawa unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop viewers have been shown elaborate videos featuring jaw-drooping effects, awesome choreography, great clothing, amazing physique
 or usee str kii purnataa kii apeksha, video set se pare sangeet-samaaroh manch se bhi kii jaati he
 So fans would not pay up to $ 300 for a concert ticket if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, or Madonna would make a coarse and flat tone without a backing track
 "there were reports that Britney Spears says," Giddins says Fans - despite her disapproval of doing so - prefer her lip-sync more because when they pay more money for a concert When they do, they expect lossless digitization
 " lip-sinking ke prachaar-prasar ko note karte hue, los angeles daily news ne khabar diya he ki "britaini spirs ke ek sangeet-samaaroh ke sandarbh main, kya isse vastav main koi fark padataa he? ek vegas revu sho kii tarah, aap sangeet sunne nahin jate hai, aap sirf iske kuch had tak haasyaaspad tamaashe ke liye jate hai"
 isi tarah, orlando centinel ke elin mendexon ne tipanni kiya he: "ek baat saafe-saafe samaj lo: britaini spirs kaa sangeet-samaaroh sangeet ke liye nahin he
 

 You have to remember that this is about the scene, not the tone

 or, uske jivan kii tarah, yah bhi, kul milakar, ek safalataa he
 Throughout her career, Spears has often been compared to her in the field of vocals, choreography and theater appearances, citing Janet Jackson and Madonna as influences of her work
 usne prerana ke ek strot ke rup main maaikel jackson kaa bhi naam liya he
 According to Spears: "I know that when i was very young, i used to respect people 


 as you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna
 or ve log mere liye bahut badi prerana the
 But i also had my own identity and i knew who i am, you know it
 " carol clerk kii san 2002 kii pustak, madonasteil main, yah kehete hue use uddhrut kiya gaya he: "jab main ek choti ladki thi, tabhi se main madonna kii ek bahut badi prashansak rahi hum
 main sach, sachmuch main madonna kii tarah ek legend bananaa chaahati thi
 

 her choreography definitely paved the way for girls to enter and do something of their own
 " kai aalochakon ne tark diya he ki spirs ko jackson yaa madonna kii bhaanti pratibha qi usee manch yaa kheme kaa nahin mana janaa chahie
 rocky mountain collegian ke patrakaron, erika montalvo or jaiki shaperd ne dekha ki "kuch tark die ja sakate hai ki spirs keval ek acchhee recording kalakaar hi nahin balki ek mahatvapurn saanskrithik pratik bhi he
 "while examining her level of proficiency as an artist, it has been questioned that" although she is classified among outstanding women such as Janet Jackson and Madonna, in fact in addition to Rock's racy, Ms
 Spears's What exactly does it have? "the Boston Globe's Joan Anderman commented that" Madonna's talent or cultural barometer from her thirteen costumes changes in 90 minutes Will not be blessed
 The army of cutting-edge R&B producers will not supply Janet Jackson's sense of humor or serious-smile 


 Britney's heroes are not great singers
 lekin ve asal gayak hai
 Spears' voice is processed by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers, so on her records, her voice sounds almost inhuman, like a robot

 "critic Shane Harrison wrote: The minimalist thump of" I'm a Slave 4 u "and from the feel of" Nasty "to scattered quotes in" Boys ", seems like an attempt at 'control'
 " apane kaam main vyaktigat or saamaajik muddon ko shaamil karne ke liye jackson ke sankalp or udyog main saamaajik drushti se sweekaarya saamagree kii simaaon ko lagaataar phir se paribhaashit karne ke liye madonna kii kshamta kaa uddhran dete hue, tulana karne par spirs kii namasuchee antat feeki pad jaati he kyonki "jahaan jackson or madonna ne mahatva ke vishyon ke bare main apane swayan ke sangeet kii rachana qi, vahiin sangeet 'main badi hona chaahati hum lekin media mujhe banane nahin degi' yaa 'ye kiti, kiti, maine apana undervier apane chamade ke pant ke baahar pahana he' kii tarah ke baildon main se kisi ek ke ek apbit sanskaran kii tarah lagata he
 " spirs ke liye madonna kaa aadar bhi tippanee kaa ek vishay rahaa he
 The author of Madonna's Drawn Worlds: New Approaches to Her Cultural Transformations, 1983–2003, Santiago fauz-hernandez and Freya jarmon-evanes note that the most well-known cross-generational relationship between Spears and Madonna exists in "entertainment The medium of news has often become obsessed with their mutual appreciation

 Prashasyamitra Shastri is a distinguished Sanskrit litterateur

 ghurnakshasthapi diksuchak yaa ghurnaksh diksuchak ek aisa diksuchak he jo chumbakeey sui kaa upyog nahin karata balki ek tej gati se ghoomane vaali discs tathaa prithvi kii ghurnan gati par aadhaarit he
 Rotational compasses are used extensively in the conduction of vessels because it has two major advantages over magnetic compasses
 pehle jalayanon main disha gyaat karne ke liye chumbakeey diksuchak kii sahaayta lee jaati thi, kintu aadhunik vishaal jalayanon main ispaat kii adhikta rahane ke kaaran chumbakeey diksuchak vishwasaneey nahin rah jaataa
 Therefore, other types of compasses began to be discovered and this effort culminated in the invention of the rotational compass
 san 1908 main ech
 ainshuj naamak german yantrashastri ne pratham vyavhaarya ghurnaksh diksuchak banaaya
 After this, USA, USA Sperry created a new rotational compass and was successfully tested on a merchant ship between New York City and Norfolk
 england ke es
 ji
 brown ne san 1916 main ek teesraa ghurnaksh diksuchak banaaya
 Notwithstanding the fundamental principles of the three, the methods of hanging rotary elements, such as rotor or rotor, oscillating shell and outer rings or gimbals, etc
 were different
 anshus ke diksuchak main plavan vidhi kaa, brown ke diksuchak main 'tel pump' kaa or speri ke diksuchak main sugrahi bhaar ko yantric vidhi se santulit karne kii vidhi kaa avlamban kiya gaya tha
 The rotational compass has three main parts: atyant teevr gati se apni dhuree par nartan karne ke kaaran dhurnak main ghurnakshasulabh jadtv utpann ho jaataa he, jiske kaaran dhuree dik main sadaa usee disha main rahanaa chaahati he jisamen vah prarambh main rahati he
 If its axis is initially placed in the meridian of the earth, it will want to remain in the same direction when the rotor is danced
 maan lijiye ghurnaksh diksuchak ko bumadhya rekha par sthit sthit kiya gaya he
 With the rotation of the earth, the ring will also move from west to east
 yadi ghurnak kii nartandhuri prithvi ke yamyottar main hogi to ghurnak par koi balyugma kaary nahin karegaa, kintu yadi dhuree kii disha yamyottar se ranchamaatr bhi hatakar hogi, to usapar ek pratyanayan balyugma utpann ho jaayga, jo dhuree ko yamyottar ke chaturdik purassaran karnaa prarambh kar degaa
 Suppose the rotary axis of the rotor is somewhat opposite to the direction of the Earth's axis
 iskaa uttari sira yamyottar se kuch kone banaata hua pashchim kii ore tathaa dakshini sira utana hi kone banaata hua purv kii ore hataa hua he
 Due to the rotation of the earth, the northern end of the rotating axis of the rotor will be bent downwards and the southern end will start to rise upwards
 is prakaar dhuree par ek balyugma swat: kaary karne lagegaa, jo ghurnak ke uttari sire par neeche tathaa dakshini sire par upar kii ore kaary karata hua prathit hoga
 With the rotation of the rotor and the combined effect of this reactive force, the axis of the rotor will start to oscillate from its west to the east, perpendicular to both its initial direction and the direction of the force
 purassaran karte hue jis kshan ghurnak kii dhuree prithvi ke ghurnan aksh ke samaantar sthiti se hokar gujaregi, sthiti thik ulti hi jaaygi, kyonki iske baad ghurnak kii dhuree kaa upree sira purv kii ore or dakshini sira pashchim kii ore chalaa jaayga
 As a result, the northern end will start to rise and the southern end will be pressed down
 is dasha main aksh par laganevaale balyugma kii disha bhi pehle kii thik ulti ho jaaygi or nartandhuri purv se pashchim kii ore purassaran karne lagegi
 Paying attention to this action of priors, it will be clear that the axis of the rotor protrudes on a long circular path
 yadi ise isi prakaar chhod diya jaay, to nirantar purassaran karti rahegi or tab yah saadhaaran ghurnakshadarshi kii bhanti kaary karegi
 In order to keep the axis of rotor parallel to the rotation of the earth, ie in the north-south direction, it is necessary to stop this process of precession
 iske liye ghurnaksh diksuchak main avamandan kii upyukt vyavastha kar di jaati he, jisase ghurna kii dhuree sarpil path main purassaran karti hui, ant main purna rup se uttar-dakshin disha kii ore unmukh hokar tik jaati he
 For this damping system, in the rotational compass, a semicircular tube filled with mercury is usually placed in the frame or rings in which the rotor or revolving wheel hangs
 upar die gaye drushtaant main, maan lijie, purassaran ke kram main ghurnak kii dhuree kaa uttari sira upar kii ore uthta tathaa dakshini sira neeche kii ore jhukta he
 This causes the mercury to flow from the top of that tube to the bottom
 is prakaar vah ghurnak kii kshaitij dhuree ke chaaron ore ek bal lagaataa he
 According to the above principle of precession, this force will try to rotate the rotor around the vertical axis until the rotor's axis reaches the Earth's merit
 jyon hi dhurnak kii dhuree yamyottar disha ko paar karegi, uskaa vipareet sira upar uthegaa, jiske falswaroop paare kaa pravaah bhi ab vipareet disha main hone lagegaa
 The axis of this pulverizer will reverse in the opposite direction and become post-merit again; But the precession gradually decreases and eventually ends, leaving the rotator's axis in the meridian direction
 jalayanon main vyavahrut honevaale ghurnaksh diksuchak main sampurna ghurnaksh pranali ko is prakaar chhallon ke ek set par aropit karte hai ki yaan ke dagamagane athwa uske veg main kisi prakaar ke parivartan aadi kaa prabhaav ghurnaksh diksuchak par nahi padane paata
 In this type of rotational compass, the rotor and its cell are not self-oscillating, but the cell has a combination pin connected to another ring
 is challe ko prakshepik challa kehete hai
 In this ring, there is a tube filled with mercury perpendicular to its axis, the upper end of which is on both sides of the shape of the bottle
 paara bhari hui is nalee ko paara prakshepik challa kehete hai
 This has been discussed above
 sanyog-pin ko tanik sa utkendre kar dene se dhurnakshadarshi avamandan kii sulabh vyavastha puri ho jaati he
 The ballistic rings have an indicator related to the shadow element with the help of bearings, by which the direction of moving the vessel can be determined

 hindi main naatakon kaa prarambh bharatendu harishchandra se mana jaataa he
 Bharatendu and his contemporary playwrights of that period composed plays for the development of public consciousness, so social problems of that time had a good opportunity to be expressed in plays
 jaisaaki kaha ja chukaa he, hindi main avyavsaayik saahitiyik rangamanch ke nirmaan kaa shriganesh aagaahasan ‘amaanat’ lakhanvi ke ‘inder sabha’ naamak geeti-roopak se mana ja saktaa he
 But the truth is that Inder Sabha was not really a theatrical work
 isamen shaamiyane ke neeche khulaa stage rahata tha
 The audience used to sit like a gimmick on three sides, on one side the seat of King Inder was put on the seat, along with chairs for the fairies
 sazindon ke peeche ek laal rang kaa pardaa lataka diya jaataa tha
 Characters were entered from behind it
 raja inder, pariyaan aadi paatr ek baar aakar vahiin upasthit rahete the
 They did not go back by speaking their dialogues
 us samay natyarangan itnaa lokapriy hua ki amaanat kii ‘inder sabha’ ke anukaran par kai sabhaayen rachi gai, jaise ‘madarilal kii inder sabha’, ‘daryai inder sabha’, ‘hawaii inder sabha’ aadi
 Parsi drama circles also adopted these synagogues and Majlisperistan
 ye rachanaayen naatak nahin thi or na hi inase hindi kaa rangamanch nirmit hua
 That is why Bharatendu Harishchandra used to call them 'natakabhas'
 unhone inaki parody ke rup main ‘bandar sabha’ likhi thi
 Thus, commercial and non-commercial literary efforts of Hindi theater and theatrical work took place before Bharatendu but the real and permanent theater of Hindi could not be built and developed
 san 1850 i
 se san 1868 i
 tak hindi rangamanch kaa udai or prachaar-prasar to hua par uskaa suruchipurna vikaas or sthaayee nirmaan nahin ho sakaa tha
 Apart from Parsi drama circles, some other small commercial circles were formed at different places but there was also a lack of literary interest in them
 vyavsaayik mandaliyon ke praytn main hindi rangamanch kii jo ruparekha bani thi, prachaar or prasar kaa jo kaam hua tha tathaa inke kaaran jo kuch achche naatakkaar hindi ko mili the-us avasar or paristhiti kaa laabh nahin uthaaya ja sakaa tha
 The writing of Bharatendu's play begins with a translation of Bangla's Vidyasundara play
 yadhyapi naatak unke pehle bhi likhe jate rahe kintu niyamit rup se khadiboli main anek naatak likhakar bharatendu ne hi hindi naatak kii neenv ko sudrudh banaaya
 Among the earlier playwrights of Bharatendu, many scholars consider the play 'anand Raghunandan' written in the Brijbhasha of Rewa Naresh Vishwanath Singh and 'nahusha' of Gopalachandra as the first drama in Hindi
 yahan yah jaananaa rochak ho saktaa he ki gopalchandra, bharatendu harishchandra ke pita the
 1868 AD has a great importance in terms of the tradition of Hindi literary theater and theatrical creation
 bharatendu ke naatak-lekhan or manchikaran kaa shriganesh isi varsh hua
 Prior to this, neither a real drama with entry-movement of characters, scene-planning etc
 was composed in Hindi
 bharatendu ke pita gopalchandar chit ‘nahush’ tathaa maharaj vishwanathasingh rachit ‘anandarghunandan’ bhi purna naatak nahin the, na pardon or drishyon aadi kii yojana vaala viksit rangamanch hi nirmit hua tha; natyarangan ke adhiktar prayaas bhi abhi tak mumbai aadi ahindi bhashi kshetron main hi hue the or bhashaa kaa swaroop bhi hindi-urdu kaa mishrit khichdi rup hi tha
 On April 3, 1868, the play 'janaki Mangal', composed by Pt
 Sheetlaprasad Tripathi, was held at the Banaras Theater
 kehete hai ki jis ladke ko lakshmana kaa abhinay part karnaa tha vah achaanak us din biimaar pad gaya
 The problem of Laxman's acting was present and if the youth did not manage the situation on that day, then the drama would have to be postponed
 bharatendu ne ek-dedh ghante main hi na keval lakshmana kii apni bhoomika yaad kar lee apitu puure ‘janaki mangal’ naatak ko hi mastishk main jamaa liya
 Bharatendu did not care for his aristocracy
 un dinon ucch kul ke log abhinay karnaa apni pratishtha ke anukool nahin samajhate the
 Thus, with this play, Bharatendu started taking active part in theater
 isi samay-unhone natya-srijan bhi armbh kiya
 From 1868 AD to 1885 AD, Bhartendu created many plays in the remaining 17 years from his dream and very busy life, acted in many plays himself, built many theater and tried to establish Hindi theater
 yahi nahin, bharatendu ke anek lekhakon or rangakarmiyon ko natya-srijan or abhinay ke liye prerit kiya
 With the industriality and inspiration of Bharatendu, an unofficial literary theater of Hindi was established in many places like Kashi, Prayag, Kanpur etc
 bharatendu ke hi jivan kaal main ye kuch rang-sansthaayen sthapit ho chuki thim : Apart from these, a strong tradition of Hindi theater and theatrical production was built in many places of Uttar Pradesh, Ballia, Dumraon, Lucknow etc
 bharatendu or unke sahyogi lekhakon ne natya-srijan kii prerana kahan-kahan se praapt kii, yah prashn paryaapt mahatva kaa he
 The importance of this question increases even more from this point of view, when we see that the Natya-composition in Hindi was started by Bharatendu's innovative talent
 yadhyapi bharatendu se purv natya-style main kuch srijan-prayaas hue the, par naatak ke vaastavik rup kaa udbhav sarvapratham bharatendu kii hi lekhini se hua
 Astu, when there was a lack of this literary genre in Hindi, where did Bharatendu take the inspiration of theatrical creation? saahitiyik prerana kii khoj kii jaay to kaha ja saktaa he ki bharatendu ne sanskrit tathaa praakrit kii purvavarti bhartiya natya-parampara or banglaa kii samasamyik natyadhara ke saath angreji prabhaav-dhara se prerana lee
 Although we had a rich Natya-tradition of the earlier Sanskrit dramatists like Bhasa, Kalidas, Bhavabhuti, Shudraka etc
, it is a matter of regret that Bhartendu Babu kept that rich Sanskrit drama-tradition in front of him
 praakrit-apbhransh kaal main arthath isa kii 9veen-10 veen shatabdi ke baad sanskrit naatak hrasonmukh ho gaya tha
 In Prakrit and Apabhramsa also, the Natya-creation did not excel like the previous sanskrit-natya literature
 at: bharatendu ke saamne sanskrit-praakrit kii yah purvavarti hraasgami parampara rahi
 Only the compositions of 'anargaraghava', 'balramayan', 'prasannaraghava', respectively of Murari, Rajashekhar, Jayadeva etc
 of Sanskrit became the ideal of Bharatendu and his associate writers
 inamen na kathy- yaa vishay-vastu kaa vah gammbhiry tha, jo kalidas aadi kii amar kritiyon main tha, na un jaisi style-shilp kii shreshthata thi
 This is the reason why the pre-bhartendu Hindi drama was utterly soulless and though Bhartendu tried to innovate and a bit of impetus by giving a glimpse of topical, social and cultural life in it, in spite of his efforts, the Bhartendu Hindi drama was both a vision of the story and the craft
 It remained in its infancy, it did not get any special climax
 is prakaar bharatendu harishchandr ke satyaprayatnon se hindi ke saahitiyik rangakarm or natya-lekhan kii drudh parampara chali
 But after the death of Bharatendu in 1885 AD, that enthusiasm became somewhat slow
 19 veen shatee ke antim dashak main phir kuch chhutput prayaas hue
 Many drama circles were established, such as 'sriramalila Natak Mandali' and 'hindi Natya Samiti' of Prayag, 'sri Bharatendu Natak Mandali' and 'kashi Nagari Natak Mandali' set up in Kashi by Bharatenduji's nephews - Srikrishna Chandra and Shri Brajchandra
 ’ in naatak mandaliyon ke praytn se us samay ‘maharana pratap’, ‘satya harishchandr’, ‘mahabharat’, ‘subhadraharan’, ‘bhishmapitamah’, ‘bilva mangal’, ‘sansar swapn’, ‘kaliyug’ aadi anek naatakon kaa abhinay hua
 But even these efforts could not go on for many days
 dhanabhav tathaa sarkari or gaiyr-sarkari protsaahan ke abhaav main saahitiyik rangamanch kii sthapana ke praytn kaalaantar main sab so gaye
 Under these small efforts, the then literary plays were acted and some good theater-oriented literary plays were composed in Hindi
 parsi naatak companiyon ke dushprabhav kaa to yah prayaas acha jawaab tha, kintu yah prayaas tha bahut hi swalp
 Secondly, Hindi theater did not develop much from this literary movement, because this theater was not different from and developed from Parsi theater - the same scheme of curtains, the same arrangement of visuals and music etc

 vaigyanik sadhano se sampann ghoomane vaale rangamanch kaa vikaas 19 veen shatee main nahin ho sakaa tha
 Efforts to set up soundtrack etc
 also could not give any significant sum towards the development of Hindi theater
 haan, inkaa yahi laabh hua kii parsi naatak companiyon ke bhrasht prachaar ko kuch dhakka laga tathaa kuch rangamanchi hindi naatak prakaash main aae
 The advent of cinema in the third decade of the 20th century brought an end to Parsi theater
 par avyavsaayik rangamanch idhar-udhar nae roopon main jivit rahaa
 Now Hindi theater is only in schools and colleges
 yah rangamanch bade naatakon kii apeksha ekankiyon ko adhik apanaakar chalaa
 There are two main reasons for this - one is that the audience of today wants to fulfill their entertainment in the shortest time, second, for the organizers, the performance of big drama also creates a lot of difficulty here, there the performance of Ekanki is simple - Theater , Scenes and legislation are simple in unity, characters are also very less
 at: sabhi shikshalayon, saanskrithik aayojanon aadi main aajkal ekankiyon kaa hi pradarshan hota he
 Dr
 Ram Kumar Verma, Upendranath Ashk, Seth Govind Das, Jagadishchandra Mathur, etc
 Many of our playwrights have composed beautiful acting-useful Ekanki plays and long plays
 prasad ji ne ucchkoti ke saahitiyik naatak rach kar hindi naatak sahitya ko samrudh kiya tha, par anek naatak rangamanch par kuch kathinaayee utpann karte the
 Nevertheless, with some cropping, almost all the plays of Prasad ji were acted on the non-commercial theater of Hindi
 george barnard shaw, ibson aadi paashchaatya naatakakaron ke prabhaav se uparyukt prasadottar aadhunik naatakakaron ne kuch bahut sundar rangamanchi naatakon kii sristi kii
 Many full plays of these playwrights were also screened from theaters
 swatantraaa ke paashchaat hindi rangamanch ke sthaayee nirmaan kii disha main anek sarkari-gaiyr-sarkari praytn hue hai
 Many non-governmental organizations have also received financial support from the government for the establishment of the theater
 purushon ke saath ab striyaan bhi abhinay main bhaag lene lagi hai
 Some good plays in schools and colleges are now performing well
 anek saamaajik-saanskrithik sansthaaon se sambhddha kuch achche sthaayee rangamanch bane hai, jaise theatre centre ke tattwavdhan main dilli, bombai, kalakatta, elahabaad, hyderabad, bangalore, shantiniketan aadi sthanon par sthaayee rangamanch sthapit hai
 The central government is also paying adequate attention to this
 par in sarvabhashayi rangamanchon par hindi bhikhaarini-si hi prathit hoti he
 The Central Government has established the Sangeet Natak Akademi, in which good playwrights and actors are encouraged
 vyavsaayik rangamanch ke nirmaan ke bhi pichley dinon kuch praytn hue hai

 shaanti niketan ke sansthaapak rabindranath tagore kaa janm 1861 i main kalakatta main ek sampann parivaar main hua tha
 His father Maharishi Devendranath Thakur established an ashram in Bolpur near Calcutta in 1863 AD, which was named 'shanti-niketan' for his meditation
 jis sthaan par ve sadhana kiya karte the vahaan ek sangemarmar kii shila par bangala bhashaa main ankit he--`tini amar praned aaraam, maner anand, atmaar shanti
 In 1901, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore established an experimental school for the education of children at this place which was initially 'brahma Vidyalaya', later 'shanti Niketan' and in 1921 AD
 `vishwa bharti' vishvavidhyalay ke naam se prakhyat hua
 Tagore was a man of versatility

 Odisha
 jayadev ek vaishnav bhakt or sant ke rup main sammanit the
 His work 'geet Govind' has been considered as a unique literature-expression of Radhakrishna's Leela after Srimad Bhagwat
 sanskrit kaviyon kii parampara main bhi vah antim kavi the, jinhone ‘geet govind’ ke rup main sanskrit bhashaa ke madhurtam geeton kii rachana kii
 It is said that Jayadeva attained self-peace by offering Radhakrishna's Ramanlila in the form of divine juice
 bhakthi vijay ke rachayita sant maheepathi ne jayadev ko shrimadbhagwatkaar vyas kaa avatar mana he
 The author of 'bhaktamala' Nabdas has written in Brajbhasha praising Jaidev- jayadev ne ‘geet govind’ ke madhyam se, radhakrishna vaishnav dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 Therefore 'geet Govind' has been called the scripture of Bhaktiras in Vaishnava practice
 jayadev ne ‘geet govind’ ke madhyam se us samay ke samaaj ko, jo shankaracharya ke siddhant ke anuroop aatma or mayawad main ulajhaa hua tha, radhakrishna kii rasyukt lilaon kii bhavukta or sarasata se jan-jan ke hriday ko anandavibhor kiya
 Jaidev was born in Kendubilv near Bhubaneswar

 An annual fair is held here in which a gathering of saints, seekers and Mahants takes place
 jayadev jagannatha ji ke darshan karne puri ja rahe the
 It was during that journey that he was inspired to compose the song Govind
 kehete hai- purushottam kshetra pahunchakar unhone jagannatha kaa darshan kiya
 Like a disinterested monk, he stayed under the tree and started doing hymns to the Lord
 unke vairaygy se prerit hokar, vahaan anya bade sant-mahatmaon kaa satsang hone laga
 Then a Jagannath devotee married his daughter Padmavati to Jayadeva under the inspiration of God
 vah grihasth hokar bhi sant kaa jivan jite rahe
 Jayadev glorified and preached Radhakrishna, devotion full of Shringar Rasa
 jayadev ke radhakrishna sarvatra evam purnat: niraakaar hai
 They are the real manifestations of eternal consciousness

 Calculus is used in writing rules related to the substitution of more than one variable
 vistaar karke athwa thode se vichaar se nimna niyamon kii satyata pramanit kii ja sakati he: column-row-change-the table value does not change by converting all columns to rows so that the twisted column becomes the twelfth row
 vilomat: panktiyon ko stambhon main purvokt niyam ke anusaar badalane se bhi saaranik ke maan main koi parivartan nahin hota
 It is clear from this rule that the same rule that is applicable for rows will be applicable for the same columns as well, so further rules will be given only for rows
 saaranik kaa kisi raashi se guna karnaa - saaranik ke kisi ek stambh ke sabhi avyavon ko raashi k se guna karne kaa parinaam saaranik ke maan ko k se guna karnaa he
 It is easier to quote a rule from a third-order tabular than a refutation of words in two columns: do stambhon kaa vinium - saaranik ke kinhin do stambhon ko aapas main badalane se saaranik kaa maan purv maan kaa -1 guna ho jaataa he
 'zero scale of a determinant' - if the components of one column of a table are in the same ratio in order from the elements of another column, then the value of the determinant is zero

 america footbaal gyaarah khilaadiyon kii do tiimon ke bich khelaa jane vaala ek lokapriy khel he jisamen har team kaa uddeshy he kii vah gend ko duusari team ke "and zone" main pahunchaakar ank batore
 The team that has possession of the ball tries to extend it to the opponent's endzone by running with the ball or throwing the ball among their teammates
 agar us team kaa koi khilaadi gend pakade hue gol kii lakeer ko paar karke virdohi oundzon main pahunch jaataa he, yaa oundzon ke andar khadaa hua apane saathi dwaara phenki gai gend ko safaltaapurvak pakad letaa he yaa phir maidan se gol kii lakeer ke peeche bane do khambon ke bich se gend ko laat markar pahunchaa detaa he to uski team ko ank milte hai
 The job of the opposing team is to somehow catch the ball by hitting, dropping, or catching the ball thrown in the middle, or to prevent the enemy team from moving towards their team's endzone
 america footbaal adhiktar sanyukt rajya america or canada main kheli jaati he
 The name of the institute that governs its sport at a commercial level is the "national Football League", which is called the short form NFL
 america main is khel ke do mukhya rup hai, college footbaal or vyavsaayik footbaal, jinke niyam ek-dusre se thode alag hai
 Football is also played in the higher classes of schools and the rules are also slightly different
 khel kaa maidan 100 gaz lambaa or 53
3 gaz chaudaa hota he
 There is a round streak on both sides of the length of the field, ahead of which there are ten zones of ten Gaz, i
e
 the total length of the field is 120 Gaz
 maidan main har paanch gaz ke faasale par ek yardline naam kii lakeer hoti he
 At the end of every endzone there are two pillars at a height of 10 feet from the ground, which are called "goalposts"
 kisi bhi samay har team maidan main apane 11 khilaadi rakh sakati he, lekin tiimon ko adhikaar hota he ki khel main kisi bhi antaraal ke samay apana ek yaa sabhi khilaadi badal de
 Therefore, football is a specialist sportsman
 kisi bhi team main vastav main bahut se khilaadi hote hai, jinhen teen prakaaron main baanta jaataa he: akramak khilaadi, rakshak khilaadi or vishesh khilaadi 
 Some players are kept in teams only because if a player with their own skills gets hurt, they can be put in their place
 zyaadaatar muqaabalon main kisi bhi team ke kai khilaadiyon ko maidan main utarane kaa mauqaa hi nahin miltaa
 The team that has possession of the ball is called "aggressive" and the one who does not have it is called the "defender"
 akramak team ke sabase mahatvapurn khilaadi ko quarterbaque kehete hai
 When the attacker and the defenders begin to fight, it is their job to quickly review the field and decide which player in the offensive team is in the best position to move the ball towards the guard team's endzone
 phir quarterbaque use gend fank detaa he, yaa khud hi bhagkar gend aage badhaane kii koshish karata he
 The entire time of the game is one hour, which is divided into four 15 minute squares
 duusari chauthai ke baad ek 12 minute kaa viraam hota he
 The ball stops several times while playing and then the playing clock is also stopped
 is se 15 minute kii chauthai vastav main 45 minute se bhi adhik le sakati he or puraa ek ghante kaa khel vastav main teen ghante se bhi zyaada chal saktaa he
 Broadcasters show commercials at these intervals when the game airs on television
 muqaabale kii shuruyaat main sikaa uchhaala jaataa he or ek team ko aakraamak team ghoshit kar ke unhen gend de di jaati he
 Now, on a 50 ghz streak, both teams stand face-to-face to face each other
 aakraamak team kaa quarterbaque apni team ke peeche khadaa hota he
 The atmosphere is such that two groups are getting ready for war
 khel shuru hota he jab gend aakraamak quarterbaque ke haathon main pahunchati he
 Immediately, the players of the defending team reach him and are stubbornly trying to demolish him
 kuch aakraamak khilaadi unase bhidakar unhen rokane kii koshish karte hai, jabaki baaqi akramak khilaadi virdohi ke kshetra main daakhil hokar apane aap ko gend aage badhaane ke liye acchhee sthiti main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 The quarterback has a few moments in which to decide: which partner to throw the ball or to find a way to run away
 kuch hi kshanon main uski raksha karne vaale ginati ke akramak khilaadiyon ko unase jujhane vaale rakshak khilaadi patakekar yaa dhakelkar quarterbaque tak pahunch jate hai
 If the ball is in the hands of the quarterback and is nabbed, it is called a "sac" and is considered very embarrassing for any quarterback
 adhik baar sac hone kaa matlab he kii quarterbaque jhadpon ke bich soch nahin paaya: vah kamazor he or aakraamakon kaa netritv karne ke qaabil nahin he
 Regardless of whether the quarterback throws the ball to someone, he himself grows it, usually the defenders take the offensive player with the ball at a short distance and the ball stops
 is sthiti ko down kehete hai
 The aggressors' job is to raise the ball at least 10 yards in 4 downs
 agar ve aisa nahin kar pate to rakshakon ko gend par qabza de diya jaataa he or rakshak ab aakraamak banate hai or aakraamak rakshak
 The possession of the ball also changes if the ball is missed by an offensive hand and a keeper catches the moving ball or the quarterback throws the ball to another offensive player and a keeper comes in the middle
 fambal yaa interspshan kii sthiti main jis rakshak ne gend pakad liya he vah virdohi ke oundzon kii taraf foran bhaagna shuru kar saktaa he or tab tak bhaag saktaa he jab tak use giraakar daboch na liye jaae, maidan se baahar na dhakel diya jaae, yaa vah oundzon main pahunchakar apane team ke liye ank hi na bana le
 When the ball stops, it is carefully measured at which gazza it is in the 100 Gaz field
 aglaa khel maidan ke bich main usee gaz par shuru kiya jaataa he
 This place is called the "streak of confrontation"
 jaisaa kii kaha gaya he, aakraamak team kaa yahi maqasad he ki chaar yaa us se kam dounon main gend 10 gaz aage bade
 Suppose they put the ball forward 10 yards in two downs
 to kaha jaataa he ki ve phir se pehle down par hai or unhen ab is nai scrimmege lakeer se phir se chaar dounon main gend ko 10 gaz badhanaa he
 This cycle continues until the offensive defenders reach the endzone or accidentally give the opponent possession of the ball
 qabza badalane par jo khel main rukaav hota he, usamen khilaadi bhi badal die jate hai
 Many aggressive players are adept at running and catching a thrown ball and often have light bodies
 bahut se rakshak bhimkaay hote hai or agar ve daboch len yaa patake den to zyaadaatar aakraamak-vishesh khilaadiyon ke liye uthaanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 a good aggressor is one who knows how to catch the ball thrown by the quarterback without making a mistake, and who can dodge the runaway defenders and extend the ball far into enemy territory
 kuch aakraamakon kaa kaam hota he ki ve rakshakon se bhiden taaki anya aakraamak gend aage le ja saken

 unki kavita main prem kii pir or bhaavon kii tivrata vartmaan hone ke kaaran bhav, bhashaa or sangeet kii jaisi triveni unke geeton main pravaahit hoti he waisi anyatra durlabh he
 The anguish, pranayanubhuti, compassion and mysticism of Mahadevi's songs attract the Kavyanurgis
 par in rachanaaon kii virdohi aalochanaayen saamaanya pathak ko digbhramit karti hai
 a section of critics are those who believe that Mahadevi's poetry is always personal
 unki pidaa, vednaa, karunaa, kritrim or banaavati he
 It is true that Mahadevi's poetic world comes under the purview of Shadowism, but to see her poetry completely unconnected with her era, one has to do injustice to her

 He published a poetry collection in 1943 during the Bengal famine and also wrote a poem called "bang Bhut Vandana" related to Bengal
 isi prakaar china ke akraman ke pratwaad main himalay naamak kavy sangrah kaa sampadan kiya tha

 His criticism is as important as his poetry
 unke sansmaran bhartiya jivan ke sansmaran chitra hai
 He did not do much work of painting, yet his portraits made in water with the 'wash' style are considered beautiful specimens of art due to the blurred colors and rhythmic lines
 unhone rekhachitr bhi banaae hai
 On the right side, the drawing of Mahadevi is placed on the face of the book of Karin Shomar
 unke apane kavita sangrahon yama or deepashikha main unke rangeen chitron or rekhaankanon ko dekha ja saktaa he

 unhone apane geeton kii rachana style or bhashaa main anokhi lay or saralata bhari he, saath hi pratikon or bimbon kaa aisa sundar or swaabhaavik prayog kiya he jo pathak ke man main chitra sa khinch detaa he
 His contribution to the prosperity of Chhayavadi poetry is very important
 chhayavaadi kavy ko jahaan prasad ne prakrutitatva diya, niraala ne usamen muktchand kii avatarana kii or pant ne use sukomal kala pradaan kii vahaan chhayavaad ke kalevar main praan-pratishtha karne kaa gaurav mahadevi ji ko hi praapt he
 Emotionalism and intensity of feeling is the most prominent feature of his poetry
 hriday kii sookshmatisookshm bhav-hiloron kaa aisa sajiv or moort abhivyanjan hi chhayavaadi kaviyon main unhen ‘mahadevi’ banaata he
 She is remembered with respect for her speeches in Hindi speakers
 unke bhaashan jan saamaanya ke prati samvednaa or sachai ke prati dridhtaa se paripurna hote the
 She was the chief guest of the closing ceremony of the Third World Hindi Conference held in 1983 in Delhi
 is avasar par diye gayi unke bhaashan main unke is gun ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Although Mahadevi did not write any novel, story or drama, the prose he wrote in his articles, essays, sketches, memoirs, roles and fine essays is an excellent example of the best prose
 usamen jivan kaa sampurna vaividhya samaaya he
 How much a creator can achieve in prose without resorting to imagination and poetic forms, it can be known only by reading Mahadevi
 unke gadhy main vaicharik paripakvata itani he ki vah aaj bhi praasangik he
 Her ideas related to social reform and women's freedom find a great harmony of perseverance and development
 saamaajik jivan kii gahari paraton ko chune vaali itani teevr drushti, nari jivan ke vaishamy or shoshan ko tikhepan se aankane vaali itani jaagruk pratibha or nimna varg ke nirih, saadhanheen praaniyon ke anuthe chitra unhone hi pehali baar hindi sahitya ko diye
 Apart from the original creator, he also has a form of creative translator whose philosophy appears in his translation 'saptaparna'
 apni saanskrithik chetana ke sahare unhone veda, ramayana, thergatha tathaa ashwaghosh, kalidas, bhawabhooti evam jayadev kii kritiyon se tadatmya sthapit karke 39 chaynit mahatvapurn anshon kaa hindi kavyanuwaad is kriti main prastut kiya he
 Initially in the 61-page 'apna Baat', he has given extensive research in relation to this invaluable heritage of Indian Manisha and literature, which enriches not only the female writing but also the overall reflective and fine writing of Hindi

 unhone anusandhan or khoj parampara kaa pravartan kiya tathaa acharya ramchandra shukla or babu shyamsundar das kii parampara ko aage badhaate hue hindi aalochana ko majbootee pradaan kii
 He put forward the development oriented style by making the language more capable for the expression of feelings and thoughts
 apni gambhir adhyayanshiltaa or shodh pravriti ke kaaran unhone hindi main pratham di
lit
 hone kaa gaurav praapt kiya
 The birth and death of Barathwal ji, who drew the light of inspiration from the research trend on the plank of Hindi literature, both took place in village "pali" near Lens Down Zone in Garhwal region of Uttarakhand
 badthwalji ne apni saahitiyik chhavi ke darshan bachapan main hi kara diye the
 He started writing poems under the name 'ambar' during childhood
 kishoravastha main pahunchakar unhone kahani lekhan prarambh kar diya
 Two of his stories were published in Purushartha in 1918
 kanpur main apane chaatr jivan ke dauraan hi unhone 'hillman' naamak angreji masik patrika kaa sampadan karte hue apni sampadakeey pratibha ko bhi pradarshit kiya
 At the time when literary consciousness was awakened in Barathwalji, there were many challenges before Hindi
 kathin sangharshon or prayatnon ke baad ucch kakshaon main hindi ke pathan-pathan kii vyavastha to ho gai thi, lekin hindi sahitya ke gahan adhyayan or shodh ko koi thos aadhaar nahin mil paaya tha
 Creators like Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Babu Shyam Sundar Das were active in the field of criticism
 badthwalji ne is paridrishy main apni anveshnatmak kshamta ke sahare hindi kshetra main shodh kii sudrudh parampara kii neenv daali
 The new beliefs established in the context of saint literature revealed his research potential
 unhone pehali baar sant, sidgh, nath or bhakthi sahitya kii khoj or vishleshan main apni anusandhanatmak drushti ko lagaaya
 Unlike Shukla ji, he proved the Bhakti movement not to be the result of the disappointment of the Hindu caste, but proved it to be a natural development of the Bhakti stream
 is sandarbh main likhe unke shodh lekh unke gambheer adhyayan or manan ke saath-saath unki moulik drushti ke bhi parichaayak hai
 Later writers based their literary beliefs on the basis of analysis
 unhone swayan kaha, 'bhashaa falti phoolati to he sahitya main, ankurit hoti he bolchaal main, saadhaaran bolchaal par boli manj-sudharkar saahitiyik bhashaa ban jaati he
 'in this way, in the style he adopted for emotionalism, his main focus was on language
 unhone sanskrit, avadhi, brajabhasha, arabi evam farsi ke shabdon ko khadiboli ke vyakaran or uccharan main dhalkar apanaaya
 Barathwalji would surely have created a vast literature, if he had come with a long life
 da sampoornanand ne thik hi kaha he,'yadi aayu ne dhokhaa na diya hota to ve or bhi gambhir rachanaaon kaa sarjan karte
 'in the short term, he will always be remembered for the strong foundation of study and research
 babu shayamsundar das ke nirdesan main agreji main likhe unke shodh prabandh 'da nirgun skool of hindi poetry' par kaashi vishavidhyalay ne unhen dilitaki oopaadhi pradaan kii
 That dissertation was strongly welcomed in the Hindi literature world
 use bhuri - bhuri prashansa mili
 Dr
 Ranade, Professor of Philosophy of Prayag University, expressed his opinion on this and said that 'this is an important gift not only for the discussion of Hindi literature but also for philosophical interpretation of mysticism
 ' baad main yah shodh prabandh 'hindi main nirgun sampradaay' naam se hindi main prakashit hua
 In the Hindi world, Barthwalji made an identity due to his research attitude and review vision, but his essayists saw the flourishing of his essay art in reflective essays like 'kaneripav' 'gangabai', 'nature of worship in Hindi literature', 'kavi Keshavdas' Roop also found great appreciation in the Hindi world
 unki prakashit kritiyon main -'yoga pravaah', 'makrand', da peetambardutt badthwaal ke shreshth niabandh' aadi hai
 He compiled and edited the works of poet Gorakhnath which was published under the name 'gorakh Bani'
 hindi ke atirikt angreji main bhi unhone kuch shreshth saahitiyik niabandh likhe, jinamein - misticism in hindi poetry' or'misticism in kabir' vishesh ullekhneey hai
 The peculiarity of Baratwalji's essays is that the basic motif of the essay becomes clear in the beginning
 niabandh ke praarambhik vaakya rochak prastaavna kii tarah ubharate hai
 Then the writer goes down into the depth of the subject
 taarkik dhang se vishay saamagree ko sajaakar vah pathak ko lubhaate hue bady rochakata or jigyaasa ke saath vishay ke nishkarsh tak pahunchaata he
 In addition to research articles and essays, he expressed his interest in Naturopathy and Yoga system by writing books like 'pranayam Vigyan and Kala' and 'meditation with self-healing'
 gadhwali lok-sahitya kii taraf bhi unka gaharaa rujhaan tha
 He also translated 'king Arthur and Nights of the Rowd Table' into Hindi for children
 shodhakarta or nibandhkaar ke saath-saath badthwalji apni darshanik pravratti ke liye bhi vikhyath the
 He based his studies on spiritual creations
 unhone dharm, darshan or samskruti kii vivechna kii
 His entire writing is the result of his deep learning
 kaha jaataa he ki mastishk kii daastaa unke swabhaav ke vipareet thi
 He was seen writing several times before each line was published

 Deori udanevaala spacketi daanav pastafaari dharm kaa ishwar he
 It was created in 2005 to protest the teaching of Intelligent Design and Creationism in US government schools
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion
 udanevaale spagetti daanav kaa pehla varnan 2005 main bobi henderson dwaara america ke kensas rajya ke shiksha board ko likhi gai ek vyangapurn chitthee main miltaa he
 With this letter, he was opposing the board's permission to teach intelligent design instead of evolution in science classes
 chitthee main ve spacketi or metbal kii tarah dikhne vaale devtaa or brahmand ke srujankarta main apni aasthaa jataa kar crieshnism kaa vyangy karte hai
 They argue that their assumptions are just as valid as the assumptions of intelligent design, and say that their assumptions should therefore have equal time with evolution and intelligent design in science classes
 apni lokapriyata or pahunch ke kaaran udanevaale spacketi daanav ko aksar rasal kii chaaydani ke samakaleen roopaantar kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki henderson ne kaha he ki "pastafaari dharm main ek hi dharm manyata kii anumati he – dharm manyataon kii naamanzoori", phir bhi pastafaari log kuch manyataayen rakhte hai
 According to the Pastafari creation myth, an invisible and inexplicable flying Spaghetti demon created the universe ten thousand years ago after drinking too much alcohol
 in manyataon ke anusaar prithvi ke trutipurna hone kaa kaaran is daanav kaa srijan ke dauraan nashe main chur hona he
 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors
 jab radiocarbon dating jaise vaigyanik maap liye jate hai, tab udanevaala spagetti daanav aankado ko badal detaa he taaki vaigyanik samajhen ki prithvi arabon varsh puraani he
 The paradise concept of pastoralism includes a beer volcano and a factory producing nude dancers
 
 Pasta Hell is similar, but beer is rancid and dancers have sexually transmitted diseases
 pastafaari manyataon ke anusaar samudri lutere vaastaviktaa main divya praani or mul pastafaari hai
 Pastafari believes that the notion of pirates being "thieves and ostracized" is the result of false information being spread by Christian theologians in the medieval period and today by the International Union of Krishna Consciousness
 inke anusaar, vaastaviktaa main samudri lutere "shanti-priy khoj yatri or sadbhaav ke prasarak" the jo bacchon ko mithaiyaan baantate the
 They say that today's pirates have nothing to do with "ancient lively pirates"
 iske atirikt, bermuda tribhuj se samudri or hawaii jahaajon ke rahasypurna dhang se gaayab hone ke liye pastafaari samudri luteron ke bhuton ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 Pastafari celebrates "international Day of Speak Like Pirates" on 19 September every year
