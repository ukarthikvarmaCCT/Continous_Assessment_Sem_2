 As Muhammad was returning from his last pilgrimage in 632, he made statements about Ali which have been interpreted very differently by Sunnis and Shias
 unhone gadir khum main kaaravaan ruk gai, sampradayik prarthana ke liye lautne vaale tirthayatriyon ko ikattha kiya or unhen sambodhit karnaa shuru kar diya
 According to the Encyclopedia of Islam: shiya in mukhyalayon ko mohammad ke uttaradhikari or pehle imam ke rup main ali ke padnaam ke rup main maanate hai; iske vipareet, sunni unhen keval mohammad or ali ke bich ghanishtha aadhyatmik sambandhon kii abhivyakti ke rup main lete hai, or unki ichha ke anusaar ali, unke chachere bhai or damaad ke rup main, unki mrityu par unki paariwarik jimmedaariyon kaa uttaradhikari he, lekin jaruri nahin ki unka pad raajnneetik adhikaar kai sufi is prakaran ko ali ke liye mohammad kii aadhyatmik shakti or adhikaar ke hastantaran ke rup main bhi samajhate hai, jinhen ve vaili sam utkrushtataa ke rup main maanate hai

 After uniting the Arab tribes into a Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life, Muhammad's death in 632 led to disagreements over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community
 jabaki ali or baaki mohammad ke kareebi parivaar apane sharir ko dafnane ke liye dho rahe the, jabaki sakifa main muslimon ke ek chote samooh ne bhaag liya, ek mohammad ke kareebi saathi abu bakar ko samudaay ke netritv ke liye namit kiya gaya tha
 Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph
 abu bakar kii pasand mohammad ke kuch saathi ne vivaadit kii thi, jinhone kaha tha ki ali ko mohammad ne apane uttaradhikari ko namit kiya tha
 Later when Fatimah and Ali sought assistance from the Sahyagis in the matter of the authority of the Caliph, they replied, 'O daughter of the Messenger of God! We have given our allegiance to Abu Bakr
 agar ali isse pehle hamaare paas aae the, to ham nishchit rup se use tyaag nahin paaenge
 Ali said, 'was it appropriate that we should quarrel with the Caliph before the Prophet was buried?' khilaafat ke chunaav ke baad, abu bakar or umr kuch anya saathi ke saath fatima ke ghar gaye or ali or unke samarthakon ko majaboor karne ke liye majaboor kiya jo abu bakar ko apana nishtha dene ke liye ikatthe hue the
 Then, it is alleged that Umar threatened to fire until they came out and swore allegiance to Abu Bakr

 is vivaadaaspad mudde ne musalamaanon ko baad main do samoohon, sunni or shiya main vibhajit kar diya
 Sunnis insisted that Muhammad never appointed a successor, yet Abu Bakr was elected the first caliph by the Muslim community
 sunni mohammad ke sahi uttaradhikari ke rup main pehle chaar khalifon ko pahachaanate hai
 The Shias believe that Muhammad explicitly named Ali as his successor in the Ghadir Khumm and that the Muslim leadership belonged to him as determined by divine command
 wilferd madelang ke mutabik, ali swayan mohammad, unke ghanishtha sambandh or islam ke bare main unke gyaan or unke gunon kii seva main unki yogyata ke saath apane kareebi sambandh ke aadhaar par khalipha ke liye apni vaidhata se aashwast the

 abu bakar ke khaliphot kii shuruyaat main, mohammad kii beti, vishesh rup se fadak, fatimah or ali ke bich ek taraf or duusari taraf abu bakar ke bich ek vivaad tha
 Fatima asked Abu Bakr to change his property, the land of Fadak and Khaybar
 lekin abu bakar ne inkaar kar diya or unase kaha ki bhavishyavaktaaon ke paas koi viraasat nahin he or fadak muslim samudaay se sambandhit tha
 Abu Bakr said to him, "the Apostle of Allah said, We have no successors, everything we leave is Sadaka
 " umm ayman ke saath milakar, ali ne is tathy kii gavaahi di ki mohammad ne ise fatima jehar ko diya, jab abu bakar ne unase apane daawey ke liye gavaahon ko bulaava dene kaa anurodh kiya
 Fatima became angry and stopped talking to Abu Bakr, and he kept following the attitude until she died
 'aisha ne yah bhi kaha ki "jab allaah ke preshit kii mrityu ho gai, to unki patniyon ne uthman ko abu bakar ko bhejne ke liye kaha ki vah viraasat ke apane hisse ke liye kahen
 "then 'aisha said to them," Did not the Apostle of Allah say,' Our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave must be spent in charity? " kuch sutron ke mutabik, ali ne varsh 633 main apni patni fatima kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad abu bakar ko nishtha kii shapath nahin di thi

 Although 'ali was one of the two leading candidates, the council's system was against him
 saad ebn abi vakkaas or abdur rahamaan bin Awf, jo chachere bhai the, swaabhaavik rup se uthman kaa samarthan karne ke icchhuk the, jo abdur rahamaan ke damaad the
 In addition, Umar voted casting Abdur Rahman
 abdur rahamaan ne is shart par ali ko khalipha kii peshkash kii ki use quran ke anusaar shashan karnaa chahie, mohammad dwaara nirdhaarit udhaaharan, or pehle do khalipha dwaara sthapit udhaaharan
 Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it
 ilon abi al-hadeed kii tippaniyon ke anusaar ilokence ali ke shikhar par unki pratishtha par jor diya gaya, lekin adhikansh matadaataaon ne uthman or ali ko samarthan dene ke liye anicchhuk rup se aagrah kiya
 'uthman ibn' Afan expressed leniency towards his relative Banu abd-shams, who seemed to dominate him, and his arrogant mistreatment towards many early companions such as Abu Dhar al-ghafari, abd-allah ibn Mas'ud and Amar ibn
 Yasir provoked outrage among some groups of people

 Dissatisfaction with his rule and the governments he appointed was not limited to provinces outside of Arabia
 jab uthman ke rishtedaar, vishesh rup se maaravaan ne us par niyantran praapt kiya, to mahaan parishad, jisamen matadaata parishad ke adhikansh sadsy shaamil the, unke khilaaf ho gaye yaa kam se kam apana samarthan waapas le liya, khalipha par dabaav daalane or apane tareekon ko kam karne ke dabaav daalane apane drudh sambandh kaa prabhaav
 At this time, Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him
 kai avasaron par ali ne udhman ke saath hudud ke aavedan main asahmat; unhone saarvajanik rup se abu dhrar al-ghifaari ke liye sahanubhuti dikhaayi thi or ammar ebn yasir kii raksha main dridhtaa se baat kii thi
 He told Uthman about criticisms of other allies and acted as negotiator on behalf of Uthman with provincial opponents who had come to Medina; This seems to have caused some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family
 aakhirkaar, unhone gheraabandi kii gambhirtha ko apane aagrah se kam karne kii koshish kii ki uthman ko pani kii anumati di jaani chahie
 There is a dispute among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman

 In particular, he clashed with Uthman over the question of religious law
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki ubaayad allaah ebn umr or walid ebn ukba jaise kai maamalon main dharmik sajaa kii jaani chahie
 In 650 during the pilgrimage, he faced Uthman with disdain for the change of prayer ritual
 jab uthman ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah jo kuch bhi use fees se le legaa, to ali ne kaha ki us maamle main khalipha ko majaboor kar diya jayega
 Ali attempted to protect mates from motherhood by a caliph like Ibn Masood
 isliye, kuch itihaaskaar ali ko uthman ke vipaksh ke pramukh sadasyon main se ek maanate hai, yadi mukhya nahin he
 But his decision was rejected due to the fact that Wilferd Madelungis did not have the support of Qureshi to be elected as Khalifa
 unke anusaar, is baat kaa koi saboot nahin he ki ali ke vidrohiyon ke saath ghanishtha sambandh the jinhone apane khalipha kaa samarthan kiya yaa unke kaaryon ko nirdeshit kiya
 Some other sources say that Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him
 haalanki, madelang ne maaravaan ko bataaya ki ali ke pote jain al-abidin ne kaha tha ki Someone was more temperate than your mentor than yours
 muslim itihaas main sabase kathin avadhi main se ek ke dauraan, ali 656 or 661 ke bich khalipha tha, jo ki pehle fitnh ke saath bhi hua tha
 Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polar communal historiography, biographical material is often biased
 lekin sutara is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek gahan dharmik vyakti tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar nyaay kaa shashan tha; vah dharmik kartavyon ke maamle main musalamaanon ke khilaaf yuddh main lage the

 Uthman's assassination meant that the rebels had to choose a new caliphate
 yah kathinaaiyon se mulaakaat kii kyonki vidrohiyon ko muhjirun, ansaar, misravasi, kufaan or basrite samet kai samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha 
 There were three candidates: Ali, Talhah and al-zubair
 sabase pehle vidrohiyon ne ali se sampark kiya, chauthe khalif hone ke liye unhen anurodh karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept office, but he turned down the offer, suggesting to be a consultant rather than a chief
 talha, jubayre or anya saathi ne khalipha ke vidrohiyon ke prastaav se inkaar kar diya
 Therefore, the rebels warned the residents of Medina to elect a caliphate within a day, or they would implement drastic action
 dedlock ko hal karne ke liye, muslim al-masjid en- naabavi main 18 june, 656 ko khalipha niyukt karne ke liye ekatra hue 
 Initially, 'ali refused to accept it, as only his most powerful supporters were rebels
 haalanki, jab madina ke nivaasiyon ke alaava mohammad ke kuch ullekhneey saathi ne unhen prastaav sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya, to vah antat sahamat hue
 According to Abu Mekhnaf's narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'ali, but other legends claimed otherwise that he was forced to give his vows
 iske alaava, talhah or ez-jubayre ne baad main daawa kiya ki unhone unhen anichhaa se samarthan diya he
 Regardless, Ali rejected these claims, insisting that they recognized them as sloppy
 wilferd madelang kaa maananaa he ki bal ne logon se pratigya dene kaa aagrah nahin kiya or unhone masjid main saarvajanik rup se vachan diya
 While many of the rebels, along with the population of Medina, gave their vows, some important figures or tribes did not
 uthman ke rishtedaar umayyaad levent main bhaag gaye, yaa apane gharon main bane rahe, baad main 'ali kii vaidhata' se inkaar kar diya
 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas was absent and 'abdullah ibn' Umar stopped offering his allegiance, but the two assured 'ali that they would not act against him
 is prakaar ali ne rashidun khaliphot ko viraasat main mila - jo pashchim main misr se purv main irani pahadiyon tak failaa tha- jabaki hejaj or anya praanton kii sthiti main unke chunaav kii purv sandhya par sthiti pareshaan nahin thi
 Soon after becoming Ali Khalifa, he rejected the provincial governors whom Uthman had appointed, replacing them with trusted allies
 unhone mugira ebn shuba or ebn abbaas ke vakil ke khilaaf kaam kiya, jinhone unhen saavdhaanee se apane shashan ke saath aage badhane kii salaah di thi
 Madelung states that Ali was deeply convinced of his authority and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for political expediency, and to fight against overwhelming odds
 uthman ke sansthaapak muvayah pratham or levent ke governor ne ali ke adeshon ko prastut karne se inkaar kar diya; vah aisa karne vaala ekmaatr rajyapal tha
 Ali's name with Islamic calligraphy in Hagia Sophia, when he was appointed Caliph, told the citizens of Medina that Muslim politics had suffered from dissent and controversy; He wanted to purify Islam of any evil
 unhone jansankhya ko sachche muslimon ke rup main vyavhaar karne kii salaah di, chetavanee di ki vah koi rajdroh bardaasht nahin karegaa or jo log vidhvansak gatividhiyon ke doshi paae gaye hai unhen kathor tareeke se niptaya jayega
 Aisha, Talha, al-zubair and the Umayyads, especially Mu'awiyah e and Marvan I, wanted to punish the rioters who had killed 'ali Uthman
 unhone basra ke kareeb deraa daalaa
 The talks lasted for several days and were later sparked by protests during the heated exchange and parley, leading to loss of life on both sides
 bhram main oont kii ladaai 656 main shuru hui, jahaan ali vijayi ho gaya
 Some historians believe that he used the issue to find his political ambitions because he found Ali's caliphate against his advantage
 vidrohiyon ne kaha ki quran or sunnat ke anusaar shashan nahin karne ke liye uthman ko maar daalaa gaya tha, isliye koi pratishodh nahin kiya janaa tha
 Some say that the Khalifa was the gift of the rebels and that Ali did not have enough force to control or punish them, while others say that Ali accepted the rebels' argument or at least did not consider Uthman a ruler
 Ruler
 aisi paristhitiyon main, ek vivaad hua jisane muslim itihaas main pehla grih yuddh shuru kiya
 Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman to be a rightful and just caliph until the end, who was killed illegally
 kuch anya, jinhen ali kii party ke naam se janaa jaataa he, kaa maananaa tha ki uthman galati main gir gaya tha, unhone khalipha ko jabt kar liya tha or kanoonee tareeke se apane tareeke se sudhaarney yaa kadam uthaane ke inkaar karne ke liye kanoon main nishpadit kiya tha; is prakaar ali sirf sahi or sachche imam the or unke virodhiyon main naastik
 This was not Ali's position himself
 is grih yuddh ne muslim samudaay ke bheetar sthaayee vibhaajan banaae, jinke paas khalipha par kabja karne kaa vaid adhikaar tha
 The First Fitna, 656–661, continued after Uthman's assassination, during Ali's caliphate, and was abolished by the Caliph's notion of Mu'awiya
 is grih yuddh islamic ummeh kii praarambhik ekta ke ant ke rup main khed he
 Ali appointed 'abd Allah ibn al-abbas, the governor of Basra and moved his capital to the Muslim garrison city of Kufa in Iraq
 baad roman-farsi yudhon or bijantin saasaani yuddh ki saikadon varshon se chali, vahaan iraq ke bich gahari jaden matbhed, aupchaarik rup se farsi main the sassanid samrajya or syria aupchaarik rup se ke tahat bijantin samrajya
 The Iraqis wanted the newly established Islamic State capital to be in Kufa so that they could bring in revenue to their territory and oppose Syria
 unhone ali ko kupha main aane or iraq main kupha main rajdhani sthapit karne ke liye aashwast kiya
 Later Muawiyah I, the governor of the Levant and cousin of Uthman, refused Ali's demands for loyalty
 ali ne apane nishtha ko waapas paane kii ummiido ko kholaa, lekin muvayah ne apane shashan ke tahat levent swaittata par jor diya
 Muawiyah refused to pay tribute to Ali by mobilizing his Levantine supporters and saying that his party did not participate in his election
 ali ne apni senaaon ko uttar main sthanantarit kar diya or donon senaayen ek sau se adhik dinon tak cyphin main khud ko deraa daale, zyaadaatar samay baatcheet main bitaai gai
 Although Ali exchanged several letters with Mu'awiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuaded him to pledge allegiance
 partiyon ke bich takaraav ne 657 main cyphin kii ladaai kaa netritv kiya
 After a violent battle known as Lalit al-harir after a week of fighting, Mu'awiyah's army was on the point of passage when Amr ibn al-aas advised Mu'awiyah to pounce his troops
 
 ali ne stratage ke madhyam se dekha, lekin keval ek alpsankhyak ladaai kaa peechha karnaa chahta tha
 Eventually the two armies agreed to settle who should be the caliph through mediation
 ladane ke liye ali kii sena main sabase bada block kaa inkaar karnaa madhyasthata kii sweekruti main nirnaayak kaarak tha
 The question is whether the arbitrator will represent Ali or Kufan, with further division in Ali's army
 ashath ebn kyuu or kuch anya ne ali ke ummidavaaron ko 'abd allaah ebn' abbaas or malik al- ashtar ko khaarij kar diya, or abu musa ashaari par apni tatasthta ke liye jor diya
 Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa
 amrit ebn al- e ko muvayah ne madhyasth ke rup main niyukt kiya tha
 Seven months later the two mediators met in Jordan 658, 10 miles northwest of Mann, in Jordan
 amrit ebn al- abu musa ashaari ne aashwast kiya ki ali or muvayah donon ko kadam uthaanaa chahie or ek nayaa khalipha chune jane chahie
 Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision, which reduced the caliphate to the status of rebel Mu'awiyah
 isliye ali ko muvayah or amrit ebn al-es ne bulaayaa tha
 When the arbitrators gathered at daumit-ul-jandal, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss matters
 jab khalipha ke bare main nirnay lene ke liye samay aayaa, amrit bin al-aas ne abu musa al-ashaari ko is baat kaa manoranjan karne main vishwaas dilaayaa ki unhen khalipha ke ali or muvaaya donon ko vanchit karnaa chahie, or musalamaanon ko chunaav karne kaa adhikaar dena chahie khalipha abu musa al-ashaari ne tadnusaar kaary karne kaa bhi faisla kiya
 According to Punawala, it appears that the arbitrators and other eminent persons met in January 659 to discuss the selection of the new Caliph, with the exclusion of the arbitrators
 amrit ne muvayah kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki abu musa ne apane damaad abdulla ebn umr ko pasand kiya, lekin baad vaale ne sarvasammati se chunaav ke liye khadey hone se inkaar kar diya
 Abu Musa proposed, and Amrit agreed, to leave both Ali and Mu'awiyah and submit a selection of the new Caliph to Shura
 abu musa ke baad saarvajanik ghoshnaa main samjhaute ke apane hisse ko dekha gaya, lekin amrit ne ali ko ghoshit kar diya or muvaaya ko khalipha ke rup main pushti kii
 Ali refused to accept his decision and found it technically in breach of his pledge to hold elections and to follow arbitration
 'ali ne virodh kiya, yah bataate hue ki yah quran or sunnat ke vipareet taur isliye badhyakaari nahin tha
 He then tried to organize a new army, but the Qasr's remnant Ansar, led by Malik Ashtar, and some of his clans remained loyal
 isane ali ko apane samarthakon ke bich bhi ek kamjor sthiti main daal diya
 Mediation resulted in the disintegration of 'ali's alliance, and some have stated that this was Muawiyah's intention
 ali ke shivi main sabase mukhar virodhiyon ne vahi log the jinhone ali ko yudhviram main majaboor kar diya tha
 He broke through Ali's force, rallying under resentment "mediation belongs to God alone
 " is samooh ko kharijiyon ke rup main janaa jane laga
 He considered everyone his enemy
 65 9 main ali kii sena or kharijiyon ne naharvan kii ladaai main mulaakaat kii
 The Qurra then came to be known as Kharijites
 tab kharijiyon ne ali ke samarthakon or anya muslimon kii hatya shuru kar di
 He considered someone who was not part of his group as an unbeliever
 haalanki 'ali ne ek bade antar se ladaai jiti, phir bhi nirantar sangharsh unki sthiti ko prabhavit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 While dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it difficult to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions
 unhone kharijiyon se ladane main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 As a result, 'ali found it difficult to expand the kingdom on its eastern front
 lagbhag usee samay, misr main ashaanti paidaa ho rahi thi
 The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali replaced him with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
 muvayah ne misr ko jeetne ke liye 'amrit ebn al' kii anumati di or amrit ne safaltaapurvak aisa kiya
 Amrit first took Egypt eighteen years before the Romans but was dismissed by Uthman
 mohammad ebn abi bakar ke paas misr main koi lokapriy samarthan nahin tha or 2000 purushon ke saath milakar kaamyaab rahe lekin ve bina ladaai ke fail gaye
 In the following years, Mu'awiyah's army captured many cities in Iraq, which Ali's governors could not stop, and the people did not support him to fight with them
 muvayah ne misr, hijaaj, yaman or anya kshetron ko parajeet kiya
 In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in their favor as people became confused with Mu'awiyah's reign and policies
 haalanki, ali ke prati logon kaa ravaiya gaharaai se bhinn tha
 Only a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and was only entitled to rule over them, while the majority supported him because of his mistrust and opposition to Mu'awiyah
 kaha jaataa he ki ali ne uthman kii maut ke baad khalipha main safal hone ke liye janata dwaara dabaae jane ke baad khalipha ke rankon main vittiya bhrashtachar or anuchit visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf ek asangat abhiyaan kii shapath lee or aagaah kiya
 The Shias argue that despite their unpopularity with the elite, their determination to push these reforms has been a cause of enmity from the rich and privileged former companions of the Prophet
 apane governor malik ashtar ko ek prasiddh patr main, unhone apane samarthak garib virdohi virdohi drushtikon ko vyakt kiya: Remember that dislike and disapproval of ordinary men, acceptance of important persons and resentment of some of the larger ones do not bother more people than imbalances, if the general public and public relations of your subject are happy with you

 Ali succeeded in forming a broad coalition, especially after the Battle of Camel
 karon or lut ke baraabar vitaran kii unki niti ne mohammad ke saathi, vishesh rup se ansaar kaa samarthan praapt kiya, jo mohammad, paaramparik janajaatiy netaaon or kurra yaa kuranik pathakon ke baad kuraishi netritv dwaara adhinsth the, jo pavitra islamic netritv kii maang karte the
 The successful formation of this diverse alliance is due to the charismatic character of Ali
 is vividh gathbandhan ko shiya ali ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jiskaa arth he "party" yaa "ali kaa gut"
 However, according to Shia as well as non-shia reports, 'ali supported Ali after his election to support him as the Caliph, the royalists were politically royal, not religiously
 yadhyapi is samay kai log raajnneetik shiya ke rup main gine gaye the, unamem se kuch ali ke dharmik netritv par vishwaas karte the
 His policies and views of governance are revealed in a letter sent to Malik al-ashtar after the appointment of the governor of Egypt

 Ali wrote in his instructions to Malik al-ashtar: chunki 'ali ke adhikansh log nammaatr or kisaan the, isliye vah krishi se chintit the
 He instructed Malik to pay more attention to the development of land than to the collection of tax, because the tax can only be derived from the development of land and anyone who asks for tax without developing land would have ruined the country
 Is and destroys people
 mukhya lekh: ali kii hatya On 19 Ramadan AH 40, which would correspond to 27 January 661, Ali was attacked by Kharijite abd-al-rahman ibn Muljam while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa
 fajr prarthana main veshya karte hue vah ebn mulajam kii jehar se lepit talwaar se ghayal ho gaye the
 'ali orders his sons not to attack the Kharijites, but rather determines that Ibn Muljam will be pardoned if he survives, whereas if he died, Ibn Muljam would receive only a similar hit
 must be given 
 'do din baad 29 janvari 661 par ali kii mrityu ho gai
 al-hasan fulfilled the Qais and gave equal punishment to Ibn Muljam on Ali's death
 ali kii maut ke baad, kufi muslimon ne vivaad ke bina apane sabase bade bete hasan ke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya, kyonki kai avasaron par ali ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki mohammad sadan ke log muslim samudaay par shashan karne ke hakdaar the
 At this time, Mu'awiyah kept both the Levant and Egypt and, as commander of the greatest force in the Muslim Empire, declared himself the caliph and marched his army to the seat of Hasan's caliphate
 yuddh shuru hua jiske dauraan muvayah ne dhire-dhire hasan kii sena ke generalon or cmanderon ko badi maatra main paise or vaade ko dhokhaa diya jab tak sena ne unke khilaaf vidroh nahin kiya
 Eventually, Hasan was forced to make peace and produce Kuwaifa in Muawiyah
 is tarah muvayah ne islamic khalipha par kabja kar liya or ise ek dharmanirpeksh samrajya main tun kiya
 The Umayyad Caliphate later became a centralized monarchy by Abd al-malik ibn Marwan
 umayyaad ne har sambhav tareeke se ali ke parivaar or shiya par gambhir dabaav daalaa
 The regular public curse of Imam Ali in congregational prayers remained an important institution that was not abolished after 60 years by Omar ibn Abd al-aziz
 madelang likhte hai: Umayyad excesses, corruption and repression were meant to gradually transform the minority of Ali's fans into a majority
 baad kii pidiyon kii yaad main ali vafaadaar ke adarsh commander ban gaye
 According to the fake Umayyad Islam claims legitimate sovereignty in Islam as a sub-rule of God, and in the context of Umayyad betrayal, arbitrary and divisive government and vindictive vengeance, they came to appreciate his honesty, his unbearable devotion
 The rule of Islam, his deep personal loyalty, the equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies
 afghanistan ke majaari sharif main roj-e-shareef, blue masjid - jahaan musalamaanon kii alpsankhyak maanati he ki ali ebn abu talib ko dafnaaya gaya he
 According to al-sheikh al-mufid, Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently he asked his friends and family to bury him quietly
 is gupt kabristaan ko uske vanshaj or chathe shiya imam imam jafar al-sadik dwaara abbasid khaliphot ke dauraan baad main pataa chalaa tha
 Most Shi'ites accept that Ali is buried at the tomb of Imam Ali in the Imam Ali Mosque which is now the city of Najaf, which grew around the mosque and temple called Masjid Ali
 haalanki, kuch afgaanon dwaara aamtaur par banaae rakhaa gaya ek or kahani, note karti he ki prasiddh sharir blue masjid yaa roj-e-shareef main afgaan shahar majaar-e-shareef main unke sharir ko le jaaya gaya tha or dafnaaya gaya tha
 Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority
 dharamshastra or exegesis se sulekh or ank vigyaan se vishyon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa, kanoon or rahasyavaad se arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti se ali dwaara pehali baar mana jaataa he
 According to a hadith described by the Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told of them, "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate 


" Muslims consider Ali a major authority in Islam
 shiya ke mutabik, ali ne khud hi yah gavaahi di: There was not a single verse of the Quran but was revealed, which he did not proceed to direct me and read to me
 main ise apane haath se likhuunga, or vah mujhe apane tafaseer or tavil, nasikh ke rup main nirdeshit karegaa or manasmukh, muhakkam or matashabih, vishesh or saamaanya 


 According to Seyed Hossein Nasser, Ali is credited with establishing Islamic theology and his citations include the first rational evidence of the unity of God among Muslims
 ebn abi al-hadeed ne uddhrut kiya he For the sake of doctrine and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art
 is tarah ke kuch bhi unke vishisht aankadon yaa nichle rankon main se kuch ke bich prasaarit nahin kiya gaya tha
 The art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sage was the only extender
 arabon ke bich sauda karne vaala pehla vyakti ali tha
 In later Islamic philosophies, especially in the teachings of Mulla Sadra and his followers, like Alemeh Tabatatei, Ali's stories and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of spiritual knowledge, or divine philosophy
 sadara ke skool ke sadsy ali ko islam ke sarvocch aadhyatmik chikitsak maanate hai
 According to Henry Corbin, Nahj al-balagha can be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines made by Shiite thinkers, especially after 1500
 iskaa prabhaav shabdon ke taarkik samanvay, katautee main mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he sahi nishkarshon ke, or arabi main kuch takneekee sharton kaa nirmaan jo saahitiyik or darshanik bhashaa main swatantra rup se unani granthon ke arabi main anuwaad ke pravesh main pravesh kiya
 In addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as Jafar, Islamic numerology, and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, have been established by Ali, through which he al-jafar and al-jamia
 ali arabi sahitya kaa ek mahaan vidwaan bhi tha or arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti ke kshetra main agrani tha
 Many of Ali's short stories have become part of the general Islamic culture and are cited in daily life as excitement and stories
 ve saahitiyik kaaryon kaa aadhaar bhi ban gaye hai yaa kai bhashaaon main kavy kavita main ekikrut kiye gaye hai
 In the 8th century, literary authorities such as' Abd al-hamid ibn Yahya al-amiri pointed to Ali's unique pronunciation of sermons and stories, as did al-jahiz in the following century
 umayyaad ke divaan ke karmchaariyon ne bhi apane vakprachaar ko sudhaarney ke liye ali ke upadeshon ko padhaa
 The most famous selection of Ali's words and writings is gathered by a 10th-century Shia scholar, al-sharif al-radi, in a book called Nahj al-balgha, who selected him for his singular rhetorical beauty
 pustak main uddhrut upadeshon ke bich note, andekha upadesh ke saath hi alef ke upadesh bhi he
 According to the legends, some of Muhammad's companions were discussing the role of letters in speaking
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki bolne main alef kaa sabase bada yogadan tha or bindidaar patr bhi mahatvapurn the
 Meanwhile, Ali read two long impromptu sermons, one according to shell writer Langroudy, without using the letter Aleph and the other without dotted letters, without deep and eloquent concepts
 ek isai lekhak jorge Jordac, ne kaha ki Aleph or dot ke bina upadesh saahitiyik kriti ke rup main mana janaa tha
 Ali is respected for his deep sympathy and support for the poor and orphans, and he pursued similar egalitarian policies during his caliphate with the aim of achieving social justice
 unhen yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he: If God grants wealth and prosperity to any person, then he should show kindness to his worthy kith and kin, provide for the poor, help those who are suffering from disasters, misfortune and the reverse, help the poor And honest people should help in ending their debt


 yah kitaab al- kaaphi main sunai gai he ki amir al-muminine ali ebn abi talib ko baghdad ke paas sthanon se shahad or anjir ke saath prastut kiya gaya tha
 Upon receiving the gift, he ordered his officers to bring the orphans so that they could lick the honey from the containers while he rested himself among the people
 nahaj al-balgha main ali ke liye jimmedaar bolne vaale upadesh, patr or uddhran shaamil hai jinhen raakh-sharif aar-radio dwaara sankalit kiya gaya he
 Reza Shah Kazemi states: "despite ongoing questions about the authenticity of the text, recent scholarship suggests that much of the material in it may actually be attributed to Ali" and in support of an article by Mokhtar Jebali Gives reference
 arabi sahitya main is pustak kii ek pramukh sthiti he
 It is also considered an important intellectual, political and religious work in Islam
 nahajul balagha ke urdu anuvadak saiyad jishaan haidar javaadee ne eech 204 se 488 tak 61 lekhakon or unke lekhakon kii suchi sankalit kii he, or un sroton ko pradaan kiya he jinamein sharif kaa sankalan kaary razi kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Masadir Nahj al-balagha wa Asanidah, written by al-sayyid ‘abd al-zahra’ al-husayn al-khatib, offers some of these sources
 iske alaava, mohammad baqir al- mahamudi dwaara nahaj al-saadah faai mastadra nahaj al-balaghah ali ke maujuuda bhaashanon, upadeshon, niyamon, patron, prarthanaaon or ekatrit hone vaale kahaniyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 jaahir he, kuch eforism ko chhodkar, nahaj al-balagha kii sabhi saamagree ke mul strot nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai
 There are many commentaries from Sunnis and Shias such as Ibn Abi al-hadid's comments and Muhammad Abdudh's commentaries
 mukhya lekh: ali ebn abi talib or alvi ke vanshadli ne shuruyaat main fatima se shaadi kii, jo unki sabase pyaari patni thim

 aakhri kii maut sandigdh he
 Some historians have added the names of Ali's other sons, including Ibrahim, Umar and Abdallah ibn al-askar, who were killed in Karbala
 unki beti jainab-jo karbala main thim- yajid kii sena ne kabja kar liya tha or baad main hossain or uske anuyaayiyon ke saath kya hua, yah prakat karne main ek badi bhoomika nibhaai
 Ali's descendants are known as Sharifs, stories or stories by Fatima
 ye arabi main aadarneey khitaab hai, sharif kaa arth 'mahaan' he or kaha jaataa he yaa kaha jaataa he yaa 'bhagwaan' yaa 'sar' kahata he
 As the only descendants of Muhammad, he is respected by both Sunni and Shia
 mohammad ke alaava, islamic itihaas main koi bhi nahin he jiske bare main islamic bhashaaon main ali ke rup main likhaa gaya he
 In Muslim culture, Ali is honored for his courage, wisdom, faith, honesty, devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving defeated enemies, and therefore of mystical traditions The center is like Sufism in Islam
 ali kuranik exegesis, islamic nyaayashasre or dharmik vichaar par ek adhikaar ke rup main apane kad barkaraar rakhata he
 Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders that trace his lineage to Muhammad through them
 puure islamic itihaas main ali kaa prabhaav mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Sunni and Shia scholars agree that the verse of Wilayah was recited in honor of Ali, but Wilayah and Imamate have different interpretations
 sunni vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki kavita ali ke bare main he, lekin unhen shiya muslim vichaar main, imam ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa jaataa he, ali ko bhagwaan dwaara mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 There are several verses interpreted by Shia scholars referring to Ali or other Shia Imams
 is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue ki quran main imam ke naamon kaa ullekh kyon nahin kiya gaya he, mohammad al-baqir uttar dete hai: "allaah ne apane paigambar ko salaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin teen yaa chaar rakaton ke bare main kabhi nahin kaha, jakaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin iske vivaranon kaa zikr nahin kiya haj lekin iske tawaaf or paigambar kii ginati nahin hui thi 
 He revealed this verse and the Prophet said that this verse is about Ali, Hasan, Hussain and the twelve Imams
 " ali ke anusaar kuranik chhandon kii ek chauthai imam ke stesan ko bataa rahi he
 Mammen lists many of these verses in his introduction to Shia Islam
 haalanki, kuch chand hai ki kuch sunni tippaneekar ali ke sandarbh main vyakhya karte hai, jinamein se vilaah kii kavita he ki sunni or shiya vidwaan is ghatana ko sanderbhit karte hai ali ne apni anguthi ko ek bhikhaari ko diya jisane masjid main anushthan prarthana karte hue bhakton se poocha
 Mavadda's poem is one of the verses, both Sunni and Shiite associated Ali's name with some other names
 mubahaalaa kii uparokt kavita, or yah bhi pad 2: 26 9 jisamen ali ko shiya or sunni donon tippaneekaron dwaara adwitiya gyaan ke saath sammanit kiya jaataa he is tarah ke chand
 The Shia consider Ali the most important person after Muhammad and he represents a complex, mythological figure in his memory
 vah gunon kaa ek paragon he, jaise saahas, mahanata, eemaandaaree, sidhaapan, vakprachaar or gahan gyaan
 Ali was righteous but faced injustice, he was authoritative but kind and courteous, vigorous but also patient, learned but also a laboring man
 shiya ke anusaar, mohammad ne apane jeevankaal ke dauraan vibhinn avasaron par suzav diya ki unki mrityu ke baad ali musalamaanon kaa netaa hona chahie
 It is supported by many hadiths, narrated by Shams, including the Hadith of the pond of Khum, the Hadiths of two weighty things, the Hadiths of pen and paper, the Hadiths of the Cloak, the Hadiths of the post, the invitation of the Nimath close family, and the twelve successors The Hadith
 jafar al-sadik haddees main varnan karata he ki mohammad main jo bhi gun paaya gaya vah ali main paaya gaya tha, jo uske maargdarshan se dur hokar allaah or uske paigambar se dur ho jayega
 Ali himself describes that he is the gateway and overseer to reach Allah
 is drushtikon ke anusaar, mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main ali ne nyaay main samudaay par shashan nahin kiya, balki sharia kanoon or iske gudh arth kaa bhi arth diya 
 He was therefore considered free from error and sin, and ordained by God by divine decree through Muhammad
 yah twailvar or ismali shi islam main mana jaataa he ki 'ekl, divine gyaan, bhavishyavaktaaon or imaamon kii atmaaon kaa strot tha or unhen goom naamak gudh gyaan diya gaya tha or unke dukh unke bhakton ko divya krupa kaa saadhan the
 Although the Imam was not the recipient of a divine revelation, he had a close relationship with God through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides people
 unke shabdon or karm samudaay ke liye ek guide or model hai;natijatan yah sharia kanoon kaa strot he
 Shia pilgrims usually go to Mashad Ali in Najaf for Ziyarat, pray there and recite "ziyarat Amin Allah" or other Ziyaratnam
 safavid samrajya ke tahat, unki kabr bahut samarpit dhyaan kaa centre ban gai, shah ismail pratham dwaara najaaf or karbala kii tirthayatra main udhaaharan diya gaya

 gregory tithi is ke liye har saal badalata he: Main article: Sunni visions of Ali see Sunnis as the fourth caliph
 ali islam ke sabase mahaan yoddha champiyanon main se ek ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Examples include the inclusion of a Quraish champion in the Battle of the Trench when no one else feared
 khayabar kii ladaai main kile ko todane ke kai asafal prayaason ke baad, ali ko bulaayaa gaya, chamatkaarik rup se thik ho gaya or kile par vijay praapt hui
 Almost all Sufi orders trace their lineage to Muhammad through Ali, an exception to the Naqshbandi that went through Abu Bakr
 yahaan tak ki is aadesh main, ali ke mahaan mahaan pote jafar al-sadik hai 
 Sufis believe that Ali inherited from Muhammad the saturated Shakti Vilah that makes spiritual travel to God possible
 jaise prakhyat sufi ali huviri kaa daawa he ki parampara ali ke saath shuru hua or junaid of baaghdaad ke rup main mana ali shaikh siddhanton or sufi mat ke prathaon ke
 Sufis read Manakbat Ali in praise of Ali
 ali ko kuch paramparaon main darj kiya gaya he kyonki un logon ko manaa kar diya jinhone apane jeevankaal main unki puja karne kii maang kii thi
 Some groups like the Alawites are believing that Ali was God incarnate
 islamic vidwaanon ke bahumat se unhen gulaat ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 According to traditional Muslims, Islam has been abandoned in these groups because of the exaggeration of human admirable qualities
 main ali-illahism, ek samadharmi vishwaas kiya gaya lagaataar vahaan he par dharm kendron avatar unke ke devtaa puure itihaas main, or bhandar 'ali, mohammad kaa betaa ji ne aise hi ek avatar mana jaataa he ke liye vishesh rup se shraddha
 Druze, a syncretic religion, believes that God was a descendant of al-hakim bi-amr Allah Ali, in particular the incarnated human being
 yah bhi dekhen: praarambhik islam kii aitihaasiktaali ke jivan par chaatravrutti ke liye praathmik strot quran or ahmadi hai, saath hi praarambhik islamic itihaas ke anya granth bhi hai
 Extensive secondary sources include the writings of Sunni and Shea Muslims, Christian Arabs, Hindus, and other non-muslims from the Middle East and Asia, and in addition to some works by modern Western scholars
 haalanki, shuruaati islamic sroton main se kuch ali kii taraf sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak purvaagrah se kuch had tak rangeen hai
 Against these assertions there had previously been a common trend among Western scholars and there were reports collected in later periods due to the tendency towards Sunni and Shea biased positions; Later such scholars about him as texture
 isse unhen kuch report kiye gaye kaaryakramon ko anaupchaarik yaa apraasangik mana jaataa he
 Leon Kaitani considered Ibn Abbas and Aisha to be a feature of historical reports during the profits of accounts reported without Isnad by early compilers of history such as Ibn Issaq
 wilferd madelang ne "shuruaati sroton" main shaamil nahin hone vaali har cheez ko andhadhundh rup se khaarij karne ke rukh ko khaarij kar diya he or is drushtikon main akele pravriti ko der se utpatti ke liye koi saboot nahin he
 According to him, Kaitani's approach is inconsistent
 medalang or kuch baad ke itihaaskaar baad kii avadhi main sankalit kiye gaye kathaon ko asweekaar nahin karte hai or itihaas ke sandarbh main or ghatnaon or aankadon ke saath unki sangatta ke aadhaar par unka nyaay karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Until the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate, few books were written and most reports were oral

 However, most of these monographs have not been used except by a few works by Muhammad ibn Jarir al-tabari, such as the History of the Prophets and Kings
 iraq ke shiya ne monograph likhane main sakriy rup se bhaag liya lekin unamem se adhikansh kaam kho gaye hai
 On the other hand, the descendants of Ali in the 8th and 9th centuries describe their citations and reports as Sadiq, such as Muhammad al-baqir and Jafar, which are collected in the Shia Hadith books

 To experience and understand the sufferings and emotions of others is called Anushubhuti or Samubhuti
 samanubhuti, asamanubhuti ke vipareet or udaseenta se bhinn hoti he
 In a sense of unevenness, a person is far from talking about understanding and feeling the pain of the people
 samanubhuti, udaseenta se bhinn hoti he, jabaki sahanubhuti se bahut aage kii bhaavana he
 In empathy, two aspects are found - one, the person with empathy feels the one who feels the other
 doosraa, samanubhuti vaala vyakti vah samaj saktaa he, jo doosraa mahasoos karata he
 The first component is called the emotional component that occurs in all beings
 jabaki samanubhuti kaa sangyanatmak ghatak keval manushya main hota he
 Only the human has the ability to understand the suffering or emotions of others from the perspective of another
 saamaajik manovaigyanikon, ke anusaar dusron ke kashton yaa sanvegon se pariprekshya grahan ke tareeke ko samanubhuti kehete hai
 Perspective credit is of three types - kisi vyakti ke man main samanubhuti utpann hone kaa ek tareek yah hota he ki kisi ghatana kaa duusare vyakti par parinaam kya hoga, isaki kalpana ke dwaara vah chizon ko samajhataa he
 It is called 'passionate Equality'
 kisi bukamp, aatankwaadi hamalaa yaa sookhaa kii aapadaa yaa traasadee se na guzarane vaale bhi jab aise logon kii madad ke liye aage aate hai, to ise anya kalpana pariprekshya ke tareeke par adhrith samanubhuti kehete hai
 The second way for a person to have empathy is to imagine how he would feel if an incident happens to him
 yah swa kalpana pariprekshya he
 For example, after seeing the occurrence of a flood or a storm, and trying to see what will be the result, it is a self-conceived perspective
 swa kalpana pariprekshya par adhrith samanubhuti main sahaayta kii pravriti teevr hoti he
 People express more empathy when they face the same type of disaster
 udhaaharan ke liye jo log pehle tufaan kaa saamana kar chuke honge ve tufaan se prabhavit vyaktiyon ke prati vishesh rup se pratikriyaatmak honge
 Those who have suffered landslides and floods will react more to the victims of floods than those who have not suffered such calamities
 garibi kaa anubhav jhel chuke vyakti garib vyakti ke prati adhik gahan samvegatmak pratikriya vyakt karte hai
 Fantasy is also a way to create empathy in a person's mind
 yah samanubhuti ek kalpit charitra, kalpit vyakti yaa jaanavar ke liye hoti he
 At the end of the Titanic shipwreck while watching the movie Titanic and watching the sacrifice for his girlfriend is a similar feeling born on the basis of Ronan Fantasy with the other characters in the film

 Conversely, close study of Saturn's rings has revealed that its rings have been intact since the early days of the solar system, that is, they have been in existence for billions of years

 The Subject Headings Authority File or SWD is a controlled keyword or descriptor system, that is mainly used for indexing in libraries
 The SWD is managed by the German National Library in cooperation with various library networks
 The inclusion of keywords in the SWD is defined by "rules for the Keyword Catalogue" 
 Similar systems in other languages are the Library of Congress Subject Headings and the Répertoire d'autorité-matière encyclopédique et alphabétique unifié 
 Since April 2012 the SWD is part of the Integrated Authority File 
 The SWD has about 600,000 descriptors and 700,000 non-descriptors as well as synonymous descriptor chains with references to a descriptor
 Its growth rate is about 5
5% per year
 About three-quarters of the descriptors refer to individual concepts and a quarter are abstract concepts
 Linking using hierarchical and associative relations is not very dense, so the SWD cannot be viewed as a thesaurus
 The terms in the SWD are also arranged in a separate classification with nearly 500 classes in 36 main groups
 The various terms are placed in a classification scheme and also contain references to sources, related terms, preferred terms and to a lesser extent hierarchical links
 But the SWD is probably not a complete thesaurus because of the low degree of linkage
 The SWD is available online through the catalog database ILTIS and is available for a fee as BIBLIODATA, together with the Name Authority File and the Corporate Bodies Authority File on the standard data CD-ROM and the standard file TITAN
 In both cases, the user interface of the SWD leaves much room for improvement
 Instead of making SWD accessible as a user-friendly navigation tool, it assumes that users are familiar with SWD and its classification scheme and enter the appropriate descriptor in the correct form before running a search
 Navigating the system or moving from one concept to another by means of hyperlinks is not possible
 The strategy of the German Library to distribute authority records commercially makes the extended use of the SWD difficult, eg in other keyword systems
 For the exchange of authority records, there is a separate Machine Exchange Format for Libraries format
 The head official of the Southwest German Library Network offers online access

 The one who has pursued the discoveries of this subject, has been meaning to follow, the faster he will win
 usne tatkaal samachar kaa vistaar kiya or feechar likhaa ki daali koun he, kin vaigyanikon ne kis vidhi se use taiyaar kiya or is vidhi kii bhavi sambhaavnaaen kya hai
 But, the clone tale is too long
 is vishay par vaigyanik bahut pehle se anusandhan kar rahe hai
 Some authors also appeared in the birth of the Kauravas from the cloned meat of the imaginary clones
 kuch vigyaan lekhakon ko yaad aayaa ki vigyaan kathaon main to clon bahut pehle paidaa ho chuke hai
 Michael Crichton gave birth to dinosaurs at Jurassic Park, who were portrayed by noted director Steven Spielberg in the film
 or haa, varshon pehle david roravik ne apni ‘in hij on image’ pustak main yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki ek udyogpati kaa clon janm le chukaa he
 Science writers who paid attention to the facts remembered Sir John Gurdon's experiments on making frogs from the cells of tedpoles, remembered the clone chuhia of Carl Ilmansey and Peter Hope, and the memory of Jerry Hall and Robert Stillman of the possibility of cloning human embryos
 Came and remembered the debate that spread around the world
 tabhi is ghoshnaa se vishwa bhar main khalabali much gayi ki maanav clon ‘eve’ kaa janm ho gaya he
 Hey so much on a clone? is vishay par to or bhi bahut kuch likhaa ja saktaa he
 That is, now you write 'article'
 sagar gaagar main vahiin samayega
 Can't give so much in this feature, right? But by giving all this in the article, you can deposit your bets

 The article should be long, if not monotonous, otherwise who will read it? The reader will turn the page
 isliye bade dhairya ke saath likhie, muhaavareydaar bhashaa or rochak style apanaaie or swayan pathak ban kar likhie
 If you are bored then thousands, millions of readers reading your article will also be bored
 kya aap nahin chaahate, log kahen- ‘vah lekh inhone likhaa he
 'you are responsible
 aap hajaaron-lakhon pathakon ke prati jimmedaar hai
 Therefore, write very thoughtfully, responsibly
 sampadakiyah agar aap samachaarpatr main kaam karte hai to sampadak aapse vigyaan ke kisi jwalanth yaa saamaajik mudde par tatkaal sampadakeey likhane kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The editorial is a critical comment on such an issue
 isse samachaarpatr dwaara us vaigyanik vishay yaa ghatana ko die gaye mahatv kaa bhi pataa lagata he
 Often three or sometimes two editorials are given on the editorial page
 kai baar aisi tippanee yaa sampadakeey kaa raajnneetik, saamaajik yaa naitik pahalu bhi ho saktaa he, isliye sampadakeey likhnaa bahut jimmedaari kaa kaam he
 While writing this, it is also necessary to keep in mind the policy of the newspaper because the editorial is considered as the statement of the newspaper
 chloning yaa parmaanu pareekshanon ko hi len
 Should human cloning experiments be conducted? Or should they be opposed? What should be the nuclear policy of the country? From this, the editorial point of view will be found
 isiilie sampadakeey main pehle vishay kii charchaa kii jaati he, phir uskaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he or samaapan sampadakeey drushti se hota he
 Satire: The field of scientific satire is still untouched
 is vidha main likhane kii badi sambhaavnaaen hai

 bhentvaarta : kisi vaigyanik yaa vaigyanik niti nirdharak se bhent karke samachar patr, patrika yaa radio va televijan ke liye vaigyanik vishay par bhentvaarta taiyaar kii ja sakati he
 It is also called interview or interview
 kisi vaigyanik uplabdhi yaa anusandhan ke bare main baat karne se pehle apane-aap ko us vishay ke bare main prashn poochne ke liye taiyaar kar lijie
 Find out all possible information about that
 parmaanu visphot par prashn poochne hai to desh ke parmaanu anusandhan kaarykram kii yathasambhav jaankaree jarur honi chahie
 If writing only news, then know information in limited but abstract form
 agar kisi patrika yaa samachaarpatr ke parishisht ke liye vichaar lenaa chaahate hai to baatcheet lambii hogi
 In this way there can be an interview for 'news' and also for 'thought'
 kuch khaas baaten jarur dhyaan main rakhieh bhent yaa intervyuu ke liye samay pehle le lijie, sthaan bhi tay kar lijie, prashnawali bana lijie, vaigyanik ke bare main jitna pataa lag sake laga lijie, milane par pehle baatcheet kaa maahaul banaaie or usee bahaav main prashn bhi poochhate jaaie
 You ask briefly, let the scientist speak but do not let them wander from the subject

 Aryabhata: Yes, Bharata, Bhasa, Kalidasa, are all part of the blood flowing in our arteries, are pulsations of our heart and inheritance from tradition
 chudamanih parampara kaa hi nishedh karne vaale vyakti ko parampara kii baat shobhaa nahin detii samraat! Aryabhata: Exploration is not a development of tradition, but its development
 koi bhi anveshak tab tak anveshan kar hi nahin saktaa jab tak vah paramparaagat mulyon, maanon or nishkarshon par prashnchihn na lagaae
 Budhgupta: Wow Aryabhata! Wow! vigyaan kathah nai khojon or nai takneekon se kya-kuch ho saktaa he-yah soch kar nae prakaar kii katha-kahaniyaan likhi jane lageen

 See the basic physical constants for detailed information
 Using dimensional analysis, it is possible combine fundamental physical constants to produce basic units of measurement
 Depending on the choice and arrangement of constants used, the resulting natural units may have physical meaning
 For example, Planck units use c, G, ħ, ε 0 { \ displaystyle c,g, \ hbar , \ varepsilon _{0}} and k { \ displaystyle k} to derive constants relevant to unified theories, including quantum gravity

 Geoffrey Chaser was an English-language poet, writer, philosopher and diplomat
 unke saath hi angreji sahitya main aadhunik yug kaa prarambh mana jaataa he
 'canterbury Tales' is his famous creation
 unki rachanaayen sahitya ke atirikt jivan ke vyapak kshetra main nae mode kaa sanket karti hai
 John Dryden has called him the 'father of English poetry'
 chasar kaa janm landan main san 1340 i
 ke lagbhag hua tha
 The father was a liquor merchant
 17 varsh kii avasthaa main inhone england ke raja edward tritiy ke putr alster ke arl ke parivaar main naukari kar lee
 Thus he got an opportunity to get a good knowledge of the modalities of the court, which he used in his poetry
 rajpariwaar kii naukari ne inaki saahitiyik pratibha ke vikaas ke kuch or bhi avasar die
 Two years later he had to travel to France in connection with the Centennial War where he spent a few days in captivity of the French enemies
 yah yatra inke saahitiyik jivan main badi hi mahatvapurn siddh hui
 Despite the faults of artificiality in French poetry of this time, it also had the qualities of beauty and artistry
 chasar ne apana saahitiyik jivan tatkaaleen francisi kavita ko vyapak rup se prabhavit karne vaali rachana 'romaa de laa roj' ke anuwaad se kiya
 The indelible influence of French poetry, and especially of this poem, is not only on his early works, but also on the 'canterbury Tales', the final and best work that presents a realistic picture of life
 rajdurbar main chasar ko apni kaarykushalta ke falswaroop paryaapt khyaati praapt ho chuki thi
 Around 1372 AD, he was sent to Italy for some important business consultations
 chha: saal baad inhone italy kii duusari baar yatra kii
 a trip to Italy gave a new twist to his literary life
 isi ke falswaroop ye francisi prabhaav se mukt ho sake
 Now the sources of his inspiration were Dante, Petrarch and Boccacio, the famous poets and storytellers of Italy
 inpar sabase adhi prabhaav bokeshio kaa padaa
 Chaser took the sad story of 'trials and Cressed' from Bokeshio
 chasar kii antim or sarvottam rachana cantarbari tels main ham unke swatantra vyaktitv kii abhivyakti pate hai
 By the time of the creation of this book, he had fully absorbed French and Italian literary influences
 cantarbari tels main chasar kisi videshi saahitiyik style kaa anusaran na kar jivan ke apane anubhav tathaa vyapak adhyayan ke aadhaar par moulik rachana prastut karte hai
 He has generally written in a sarcastic manner regarding women and married life
 sambhav he aisa inhone keval vinod ke liye kiya ho
 His wife's name was Philippa
 san 1400 i
 main chasar kii mrityu hui
 Some important events took place during the lifetime of Chasur
 sabase mahatvapurn england or france ke bich lagbhag sau varsh tak chalanevaala yuddh hi tha jisamen inhone swayan bhaag liya tha
 But this poem neither mentions this war nor expresses maliciousness against enemies
 isi samay kisaanon kaa vidroh tathaa vinaashkari plig jaisi aitihaasik mahatv kii ghatnaayen hui
 But there is no mention of them in his compositions
 phir bhi cantarbari tels main na keval england ke tatkaaleen saamaajik jivan kii, europea jivan main ho rahe mahatvapurn parivartanon kii spasht jhalak dekhne ko milti he
 By this time, public attention was being paid to the corruption prevalent in the Church of Rome
 yatratatra padariyon kii charitrik trutiyaan kii khari aalochana bhi hone lagi thi
 This was a symptom of the great change in European ideology widely influenced by religion which we also see in the Canterbury Tales
 saath hi saath logon kaa dhyaan ab parloukik baton se hatakar bhautik jagat kii samasyaon tathaa dainik jivan ke sukh du:kha kii ore jane laga
 This important trend of European biography is also reflected in the Canterbury Tales and other works of Chaser
 madhyayugin sahitya adhikanshat: kalpanapradhan tha yaa aadhyatm tathaa naitikta kii shiksha dene kaa madhyam maatr
 Chaser gave him an independent existence free from the urges of class and morality
 sahitya rachana main unka uddeshy pradhanat: jivan ke prati apni vyaktigat anubhatiyon kii manoranjak abhivyakti tha
 All these characteristics of Chaser's literature are seen with full blossom in Elizabethan carpet literature almost two hundred years later
 is prakaar ham unhen europea punarjagran kaa aadya angreji kavi kah sakate hai
 As has been said, Chaser started his literary life with a translation of 'romain de la Rose'
 roopak shailo main prem kii vyakhya prastut karanevaala vah kavy bhinn hi nahin apitu paraspar virdohi prakruti ke do francisi kaviyon kii kriti he
 In a dream, a lover tries to pluck the flower of love in a beautiful garden
 praarambhik bhaag prem kaa bada hi shisht, sundar evam prabhavotpadak chitra prastut karata he lekin badwaale bhaag main duusare kaviyon ne striyon tathaa prem ke varnan main dhyangyatmak style apanaai he
 In many of Chaser's compositions, we see the influence of French poetry
 'book aanv dachez' 'house ov fame' tathaa 'parlment ov foules' roopak style main hai
 The events described in the three seem to be seen in a dream
 book ov daches tathaa parlment ov foules main kavi darbari parampara ke anusaar prem kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 We also find such an ideal depiction of love in Ron de la Rose
 'tryles and cracid' kii kahani bokeshio se lee hui he
 This grief confirms the Italian influence over the poetic chaser
 trialas niraash premi he jisaki premika cracid usase alag ho jane par ek anya purush kaa varan kar leti he
 Chaser composed 'legend of Good Women' as she herself stated in the preface, on the queen's complaint that she had 'accused the entire female race of being unreliable by Cressid's character
 is adhuri pusatak main lagbhag das aitihaasik tathaa puranic khyatipraapt naariyon kaa prashansaatmak jeevanavrittant he
 Chaser's final and best composition is 'canterbury Tales'
 angreji samaaj ke vibhinn staron tathaa peshon kaa pratinidhitiv karanevaale lagbhag tees tirthayatri jo cantarbari nagar main tamas baket kii samadhi par apni shradhanjali arpit karne janevaale hai ek sarai main ikattha hote hai
 With the idea that the road should not be tired and be entertained, it is decided at the suggestion of the lord of the inn that every traveler should tell four stories while leaving and two return times
 jisaki kahaniyaan bahumat dwaara sarvottam samajhi jaaen, use sab log milakar usee sarai main acchhee daavat den
 The stories of 'canterbury' are derived from the entire European anecdote literature, not Chaser's own work
 uski melikata yatriyon ke charitra ke sookshm adhyayan main dekhne ko milti he
 Chasar, through his thirty-one passers, with a high degree of characterization in characterization, has also achieved laudable success in presenting a comprehensive portrait of the erstwhile British society
