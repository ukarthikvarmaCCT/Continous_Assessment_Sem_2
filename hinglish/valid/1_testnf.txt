 Traditional fission power is sometimes considered renewable energy, but it is controversial for political reasons as concerns about peak uranium, the disposal of radioactive waste and the risk of accidents, terrorism, or natural disasters are expected
 urja dakshata or navikarniya urja ko akshay urja ke doharith stambh kaha jaataa he
 Some definitions of renewable or sustainable energy are as follows: "urja, jo manushya ke jivan kaal main punah-poorti yogya ho or jo paryaavaran ko koi lambii avadhi kaa nuksaan na panhuchaye
" - jamaica akshay vikaas network By focusing on the potential of the energy source that continues to carry out energy intensive work, renewable energy is separated from other terms used for renewable energy, such as alternative energy and green energy
 jab tak anishchit kaal tak urja strot ke baari maatra main upyog par pratibandh lagaana sambhav na ho, akshay urja kuch maatra main paryaavaran ko pradooshit kar sakati he
 Renewable energy is also different from low carbon energy, which is renewable in the same sense unless it adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
 harith urja aisi urja he jise paryaavaran ko prabhavit kiye bina avatarit, utpann or / yaa upyog main laayaa ja sake

 Renewable energy technologies inevitably contribute to renewable energy because they typically provide global energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and the opportunity to reduce greenhouse gases
 antarrashtriya urja agency kahati he ki: First-generation technologies emerged from the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century and included hydropower, biomass combustion, and geothermal power and heat
 Some of these technologies are still in widespread use
 Second-generation technologies include solar heating and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics
 These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration investments since the 1980s
 The initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the continuing appeal of these renewables is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits
 Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials
 Third-generation technologies are still under development and include advanced biomass gasification, biorefinery technologies, concentrating solar thermal power, hot dry rock geothermal energy, and ocean energy
 Advances in nanotechnology may also play a major role

 In order to move towards energy renewable, not only the methods of energy supply will have to be changed but also the methods of energy use, and the amount of energy required for various services and goods will also have to be reduced
 Abundance and diversity are opportunities for improvement in favor of the demand of the energy equation, in the same way as it provides significant practical benefits in favor of fulfillment
 navikarniya urja or urja sakshmata, kaha jaataa he ki kabhi-kabhaar akshay urja yojana ke "judawaan khambhe" hote hai
 Both resources must be developed in order to maintain stability and decrease carbon dioxide emissions
 Efficiency slows down energy demand due to which clean energy supply can cut the use of organic fuel

 In many countries, green energy currently provides only a small amount of electricity, usually 2 to 5% of the total illuminated energy is contributed by green energy
 sanyukt america ke kuch rajyon main, sthaneey sarkaron ne samudaay vikalp ekatrikaran tathaa saura bandhon kaa upyog kar pradeshik vikray pool / sethu banaae he jinase navikarniya mishrit athwa ucch urja kaa 51% hissaa karidaa ja sake, jaise ki san francisco shahar main kiya gaya he
 By participating in the Green Energy Program, a consumer, impacting on the energy source being used, ultimately aids in the spread and use of green energy
 ve upabhokta is madhyam se niti nirmaataaon ko yah sandesh bhi dete hai ki ve navikarniya urja kaa samarthan karte hue uskaa mulya dene ko taiyaar hai
 Green energy consumers either force utility companies to increase the amount of green energy they buy from the group, or they increase the amount of green energy funds through a green energy provider

 In the United States, the major problem with purchasing green energy through the power grid is that the existing centralized infrastructure that provides electricity to the consumer is not qualified / capable
 is aksham buniyadi suvidha vaale dhaanche ke chalate lagaataar brown out or blike out, ucch CO2 utsarjan, adhik urja laagat, urja gunvattta jaisi samasyaayein upji hai
 In order to expand this new system, increasing demand will be met by investing an additional amount of $ 450 billion in the next 20 years
 Apart from this, this centralized system is now being loaded with the burden of taxes by including renewable energy like wind, solar and geothermal energy
 Renewable resources are often located in remote areas where there is less energy demand due to greater space penetration
 maujuuda buniyadi dhaanche se is urja ko shahari kendron jaise maang vaale kshetron tak sthanantarit karnaa atyaadhik aksham evam kathin kaary hi hoga

 However, several proposals are being made for initiatives to address these distribution problems
 sabase pehle, sanyukt rajya america kaa CO2 utsarjan kam karne ke liye or vaishvik varming kii gati dhimi karne hetu sangrakshan ke madhyam se sabase prabhavi tareeke se prayaas jaruri he
 The current opponents of the American power grid have also advocated decentralization of the grid

 a modern concept for improving our electricity grid is that microwaves are launched directly from satellites in the earth orbit or the moon wherever and wherever they are demanded
 The power generated from solar energy will be achieved on the lunar surface under this system, "the recipient will be a four-tent shaped structure that will work to obtain microwaves and convert them into electricity
" In 2000 NASA said that it is beneficial to work on this technology, but it is not right to say so soon whether it will be cost effective or not

 Those who are not satisfied with the third-party green grid-connected power grid approach can establish their own local-based renewable energy system
 saura se pawan or yahan tak ki kuch prakarnon main sthaneey pen bijli se navikarniya urja vidyut tantra, kai prakaar main se kuch navikarniya urja tantra sthaneey rup se uplabdh he
 Additionally, for those who want to heat or cool their homes with renewable energy, there is a geothermal pump system that uses the static temperature of some of the ground below the ground, which is about 7 -15 ° C
 All this is synonymous with the heat gained by conventional natural gas and petroleum
 sanyukt rajya america main is drushtikon kaa laabh yah he ki kai rajya akshay / navikarniya urja pranali sthapit karne hetu laagat main chhut or protsaahan pradaan karte hai
 In the US, California, Massachusetts, and many other states, a new approach is being adopted in communities for community energy supplies, called community option aggregation, under which municipal funding is relaxed to support this energy, and green funding for development
 Energy is spent on the use of resources
 vyaktiyon ko aamtaur par aashwaasan diya jaataa he ki jis bijli kaa ve upyog kar rahe hai vastav main vah ek harith rang kii urja hi he jo ki unke niyantran ke harith urja strot se nirmit he
 As soon as this system is paid, the owner of renewable / renewable energy can own and manufacture renewable electrical energy, essentially without cost, and sell the surplus product to the local utility center with profit
 akshay / navikarniya urja ke utpaadan ke baad use upyog main laane vaale madhyam main sangrahit kiya jaataa he, yah madhyam swytt upkaran hote he or iske saath hi ise vaahanon par bhi sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, energy storage is required to provide domestic electricity in remote areas so that it can be used with renewable energy
 In the latter case, the energy generation and consumption mechanisms are usually the executive power systems themselves
 kuch udhaaharan: However, renewable / renewable energy is usually derived from the main electric grid
 iskaa arth yah he ki urja bhandaaran adhiktar upyog main nahin laayaa jaataa kyonki mukhya vidyut grid ko yojit kar us vishisht samay par upbhog kii jane yukt maatra kii hi bijli banaai jaati he
 Energy generation on the main power grid is done in a combination of renewable energy plants as well as other organic fuels such as power plants and nuclear power
 haalanki yah sangyojan he, jo is prakaar kii urja aapurti ke liye aavashyak he, saath hi navikarniya bhi,, sarvottam niraakaran he shakti sanyantron ko charan baddh tareeke se band kiya jaye

 Apart from defeating fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, the other synonym is only to accelerate the distribution and utilization of power from renewable sources
 In this system, re-storage of energy is not necessary
 For example, Trace proposes that it is ready to distribute solar energy from the Sahara to Europe
 europe sahaara or anya deshon ko hawa or sagar se nirmit bijli vitarit kar saktaa he
 In this way, energy can be produced at any time and at any point of the planet because the sun or wind is always present or there is always movement in the ocean's waves and currents
 yah vikalp haalanki alpavadhi main sambhav nahin he, isliye jeevashm eendhan or parmaanu shakti ab bhi urja ke mukhya strot hai mukhya taar bijli net par or ratorat unhen visthapit karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Several large-scale energy storage suggestions regarding grids have been completed
 yah kshamta main sudhaar kar urja ke nuksaan ko kam karata he kintu sthanantaran urja bhandaaran hetu mukhya grid tak ek bahut mahanga samaadhaan he
 Some potential cost can be reduced by using energy storage devices that the consumer buys and not the state
 An example is the car battery used in personal vehicles, which will double as an energy buffer for the power grid
 However, apart from the cost, setting up this type of system would be an extremely complex and difficult process
 In addition, energy storage vessels such as car batteries are also made from materials that are environmentally hazardous
 The combined production of batteries will not be in the interest of the environment even for such a large population
 In addition to car batteries, however, other large-scale energy storage tips have been completed for grids that are less polluting energy carriers

 Estimates for fuel reserves vary widely
 sanlayan janit urja kaa dirghakaalik sthayitv is baat par nirbhar he ki, ek vyaavhaarik or sasti praudyogiki viksit kii ja sakati he yaa nahin
 Proponents like Christine Todd Whitman and Patrick Moore also claim that nuclear power is as environmentally friendly as energy derived from other conventional renewable sources, so it is considered appropriate given the diagnosis of global warming and the growing demand for energy in the world can go
 ve is taraf bhi dhyaan dete hai ki parmaanu bijli sanyantr, ek baar banane ke baad or unhen band karne kii prakriya shuru karne ke pehle tak bahut kam maatra main carbon dioxide kaa utsarjan karte hai tathaa eendhan jeevashm kii tulana main kaaphi kam maatra main radiodharmee kachare kaa utpaadan karte hai
 Robert Bryce argues that nuclear power will dominate and be inevitable in the future because it is inherently superior to any other method emitting low carbon power in terms of energy density, reliability, and land expected per unit

 Muktak is a type of poetry or poetry in which there is no managerialism
 isamen ek chand main kathith baat kaa duusare chand main kahi gayi baat se koi sambandh yaa taratamya hona aavashyak nahin he
 Couplets of Kabir and Rahim; Meerabai's verses are all free compositions
 hindi ke reetikaal main adhikansh muktak kaavyon kii rachana hui
 The word Muktak means 'complete in itself' or 'other absolute thing'
 Thus, Muktak is a genre of poetry in which the story has no prior connection
 Each stanza in itself is completely independent and gives full meaning
 sanskrit kavy parampara main muktak shabd sarvapratham aanandavardhan ne prastut kiya
 aisa nahin mana ja saktaa ki kavy kii is disha kaa gyaan unase purv kisi ko nahin tha
 acharya dandi muktak naam se na sahi par anibaddh kavy ke rup main isse parichit the

 Hemachandracharya used the word muktakadi instead of the word muktak
 He gave his symptom in the tradition of Dandi and said that those who are unconcerned are free
 aadhunik yug main hindi ke acharya ramchandra shukla ne muktak par vichaar kiya
 unke anusaar: In Muktak there is no flow of juice like the management, in which the reader forgets himself in the context of the story and takes a lasting impression in the heart
 There are sprinkles of juice in it, in which the heart-buds blossom for a while
 If the arrangement is a wide forest floor, then Muktak is a chosen bouquet
 This makes it more suitable for societies
 It does not display a full life or any part of it organized by successive scenes, but a delightful segment-scene is brought forth in such a way that the reader or listener becomes enchanted for a few moments
 For this, the poet has to imagine a small stanza of captivating goods and trades and display them in very concise and strong language
 acharya shukla ne anyatra muktak ke liye bhashaa kii samaas shakti or kalpana kii samaahaar shakti ko aavashyak bataaya tha
 govind trigunayat ne usee se prabhavit hokar nimna paribhaasha prastut kii: In my understanding, Muktak is the composition in which, despite the lack of management, the poet, with the help of the collective power of his imagination and the social power of language, presents such a picturesque and soulful description of a delightful scene, situation, event or thing, The readers enjoy the kind of management
 vastut: yah paribhaasha trutipurna he
 prabandh jaisaa anand kahana uchit nahin he

 larence colberg ne naitik vikaas ke chah charan hai jinhen aasaani se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Each of these six steps is more perfect than its earlier stage in solving moral misdeeds
 piyaaje kii tarah colberg ne bhi paaya ki naitik vikaas kuch charnon main hota he
 Kolberg found that these phases are universal
 bacchon ke saath bees saal tak ek vishesh prakaar ke saakshaatkaar kaa prayog karne ke baad colberg in nirnyon par pahunche
 In these interviews, the children were told some stories that had many ethical implications for the characters in the stories
 usamen se sabase lokapriy duvidha yah he- This story is one of eleven stories that Kolberg used to explore moral development
 yah kahani padhane ke baad jin bacchon se saakshaatkaar liya gaya unhen naitik duvidha par banaae gaye kuch prashnon ke uttar dene hote the
 On the basis of the answers given by the interview, Kolberg has stated three stages of moral thinking, which are again divided into two phases
 yah naitik chintan kaa sabase nichalaa charan he
 What is right and wrong at this stage has the effect of punishment and gift from outside
 charan 1 : bahari satta par aadhaarit Step 2: Person-centered, ethical thinking based on caring for one another - This is the second stage of the stereotype
 yahaan baccha sochataa he ki apane hiton ke anusaar kaary karne main kuch galat nahin he, par hamen saath main dusron ko bhi unke hiton ke anuroop kaam karne kaa mauka dena chahie
 Therefore, this level of moral thinking says that the same thing is right in which equal transactions are being done
 agar ham duusare kii koi ichha puri kar den to ve bhi hamaari ichha puri kar denge
 This is the second stage of Kolberg's principles of moral development
 is avasthaa main log ek purv aadhaarit soch se chizon ko dekhte hai
 As seen, often the behavior of children is based on the rules made by their parents or some older person
 charan 3 : achche aapasi vyavhaar va sambandhon par aadhaarit naitik chintan - yah colberg ke naitik vikaas ke siddhanton kii teesri avasthaa he
 In this situation people believe that trust, taking care of others, fair behavior of others are the basis of their moral behavior
 bachche or yuva apane mata-pita dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye naitik vyavhaar ke maapdandon ko apanaate he jo unhen unke mata-pita kii najar main ek "acha ladkaa yaa acchhee ladki"‘ banaate hai
 Step 4: Moral Concerns Based on Maintaining Social Order - This is the fourth stage of Kolberg's principles
 is sthiti main logon ke naitik vikaas kii avasthaa saamaajik aadesh, kanoon, nyaay or karttavyon par aadhaarit hoti he jaise kishor sochate hai ki samaaj achche se chale iske liye kanoon ke dwaara banaae gaye daayre ke andar hi rahanaa chahie
 This is the fifth stage of Kolberg's principles of moral development
 is sthiti main vaikalpik raste khoje jate hai or phir apana ek vyaktigat nack vyavhaar kaa rasta dhundha jaataa he
 Step 5: Moral Concerns Based on Social Contracts, Utilities and Individual Rights - This is the fifth stage of Kolberg's theory
 is avasthaa main vyakti yah sochane lagata he ki kuch mulya, siddhant or adhikaar kanoon se bhi upar ho sakate hai
 One begins to evaluate the actual social systems with a view of the extent to which they preserve fundamental rights and values
 charan 6 : saarvbhaumik niti sammat siddhanton par aadhaarit naitik chintan - yah colberg ke naitik siddhanton kii sabase oonchi or chhathi avasthaa he
 In this state, the individual sets moral standards based on universal human rights
 jab bhi koi vyakti antartma kii aawaaj ke dwand ke bich fansaa hota he to vah vyakti yah tark karata he ki antartma kii aawaaj ke saath chalanaa chahie, chaahe wo nirnay jokhim se bharaa hi kyon na ho
 That is why, before doing anything, he should have thought about the life of others besides his feelings
 colberg maanate hai ki yahevam avasthaaen ek kram main chalate hai or umr se jude hue hai
 Children work at the first level before the age of 9
 adhiktar kishor teesri avasthaa main sochate paae jate hai par unamem duusari avasthaa or chauthi avasthaa ke soch vichaar ke kuch lakshan bhi dikhaai de sakate hai
 On reaching early adulthood, only a few people rise above stereotypes and make ethical arguments
 lekin ve koun se saboot hai jo is tareeke ke vikaas ko pramanit karte hai? 20 saal ke lambe adhyayan ke parinaamon ke anusaar umr ke saath avasthaa 1 or 2 kaa upyog gata he or avasthaa 4 jo 10 saal kii umr ke bacchon ke naitik tark main bilkul bhi nahin aati, vah 36 saal kii umr ke 62 pratishat logon kii naitik soch main dikhaai di
 The fifth stage does not come at all from 20 to 22 years of age and it never appears in more than 10 percent
 isiilie naitik avasthaaen jaisaa ki colberg ne shuruuaat main sochaa tha, usase thodi der main aati he or chhathi avasthaa main chintan karnaa to bahut oonchi avasthaaon main aata he, jo ki bahut vilakshan he
 Although Phase 6 has been removed from Kohlberg's moral decisive numeral system, it is still theoretically considered necessary for Kolberg's concept of moral development
 aise koun se kaarak he jo colberg kii avasthaaon se guzarane par asar daalate he? haalanki har avasthaa main naitik tark is baat par aadhaarit hota he ki kuch str kaa sangyanatmak vikaas hoga
 Kolberg argues that children's cognitive development does not ensure the development of their moral thinking, but that children's moral rationality shows how they have had experience in resolving moral questions and moral duality
 colberg maanate the ki bacchon kii aapas main baatcheet aise saamaajik uddipano main se aham cheez he jo bacchon kii apni naitik soch ko badalane kii chunauti pradaan kar sakati he
 While adult rules and rules are imposed on children, mutual transactions in children provide them with an opportunity to see the other person's perspective and make rules in a democratic way
 colberg kehete hai ki bacchon main dusron kaa drushtikon lene kii kshamta unke naitik tark main pragati laati he
 Kolberg's principles of ethics have been criticized on the following points: colberg ke aalochakon ke anusaar colberg ke naitik siddhanton kaa sara dhyaan naitik soch tak simit he or unamem naitik vyavhaar ke bare main zyada baat nahin kii gai he
 He says that talking about moral behavior is as important as talking about moral thinking because many times people show that their thinking is quite moral but their behavior is the opposite
 jaruri nahin he ki soch kaa daawa karne vaale log naitik vyavhaar bhi karen
 That is why it becomes necessary to study both moral thinking and ethical behavior
 jaise netaa kai naitik daawey karte hai parantu unka vyavhaar kai baar aniatik va unke daawey ke vipareet hota he
 Apart from this, despite the understanding of morality, people do immoral acts
 jaise choron ko pataa he ki chori karnaa galat kaam he parantu iske baavjood vah chori karte hai
 Bandura, on the other hand, says that many people try to justify their immoral behavior with moral motives in the eyes of themselves and society, such as attacks in the name of jihad and anti-abortion activists who drop child abortions and destroy hospitals And blood of doctors
 aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki colberg ke siddhanton main naitikta ke moolyankan par khaas dhyaan dena chahie
 He believes that the story that Kolberg uses to evaluate moral arguments is quite difficult to evaluate
 iske alaava colberg jo duvidhaayen prastut karte hai, ve bhi naitik tarkon kaa moolyankan karne ke liye asli jindagi main aane vaali duvidhaon se kaaphi alag hai
 According to Kolberg, his states of moral reasoning are universal but according to some critics, his theories are culturally biased
 parantu colberg or unke aalochak donon hi kuch had tak thik hai
 The first four stages of Kolberg's theories were found universal in 45 studies conducted in 27 cultures
 parantu paanchavi or chhathvin avasthaaen sari samskritiyon main nahin pai gai hai tathaa yah bhi paaya gaya ki colberg kii moolyankan vyavastha main anya samskritiyon main paae jane vaale ucch naitik tarkan samahit nahin he tathaa naitik chintan, jitna colberg ne sochaa tha usase zyada samskruti vishesh par nirbhar karata he
 Ethics based on the morality of the holiness of every living being in India and the unity of the living world, the morality based on community equality and collective happiness in Israel, and the thinking of collective moral responsibility in New Zealand are not high in the states of Kolberg's moral logic Will be kept because they have given more consideration to the idea of justice than other views
 baavjood iske ki colberg ke siddhant kaaphi sari samskritiyon ke liye thik baithte hai parantu vah kuch samskritiyon kii naitik avadharanaon ko nahin shaamil karte
 Kolberg believes that family processes do not necessarily mean much to the moral development of children
 unka kahana he ki bacchon or mata-pita ke bich kaa sambandh bacchon ko ek duusare kii raay lene ke bahut kam avasar dete hai
 Rather, children get more opportunities for moral development with their friends
 vikasvaadi vyaktiyon kaa maananaa he ki doston ke saath sakriy anushaasan yani tark ko istemaal karnaa or bacchon kaa dhyaan unke dwaara kiye gaye kaaryo ke nattejey par le jane se bhi unka naitik vikaas hota he
 In addition, parents' own moral values also aid children's moral development
 carol giligan kii aalochana ke anusaar colberg ke siddhant ling bhed par aadhaarit he
 Gilligan states that Kohlberg's principles are based on male customs that put principles above mutual relations
 ve maanate he ki vyakti apane naitik nirnay swatantra rup se lete hai
 Ethics in Kolberg's approach is based on justice, but Gilligan believes that Kolberg did not include the view of care in his ethical principles
 unhone aapasi sambandh, ek dusron kii chintaa kii bhaavana, ek duusare kii judaav kii bhaavana ko apni naitikta main koi sthaan nahin diya he
 According to Gilligan this happened because Kolberg is a man himself and his theory is based on research conducted on men and their responses
 jabaki giligan ne jab 6 se 18 saal kii ladakiyon ke javaabon kaa adhyayan kiya to unhone dekha ki ladkiyaan manushya ke aapasi sambandhon ke aadhaar par naitik duvidha kaa nirnay leti thi
 But some studies have raised doubts about gender discrimination in moral judgment
 unke anusaar naitik nirnay main yah bhed bahut kam hote hai or purush or mahila donon aapasi sambandhon vaali duvidhaon ko dekhbhaal ke drushtikon se hal karte hai or saamaajik duvidhaon ko nyaayik drushtikon se hal karte hai The Nelson Monument or Nelsons' Manument is a tower on the Calton Hill near Edinburgh, which commemorates a British naval officer, Vice Admiral Horacio Nelson, weighed on the Spanish and French armies at the Battle of Trafalgar in Nelson, between 1807 and 1815 Made in remembrance of happiness

 Krishna Lal Bhil is a Hindu diplomat in Pakistan
 uskaa janm march 1 1968 ko hua
 Completed the examination from Sindh University in 1990
 pakistan ka majalis-e-shur me ek rajanyik ko thappad diya
 majlis-e-shur had a battle in the Walk war
 is main pakisataan kaa pradhan mantrikuch or rajanyak to aapmaana kiy
 On the one hand, the diplomat, who supported Parvez Musharraf, insulted Krishna Lal Bhil
 rahma to bhil confront kiya, insult kiya, to "hindu" to call kiya
 Bhil then Rahman gave him three pats labhaansh kisi company ke laabh main bhagidaaron kaa ansh hota he jo vah company laabh kamaane par apane shairdharakon ko detii he
 Dividends in a joint stock company are paid on the basis of fixed value of shares
 is maamle main shairdharak uske share ke anupaat main dividend grahan karata he
 Dividend can be given in money, shares or other forms
 kisi vyapaarik company ke anshadhariyon main laabh ke jis bhaag kaa vibhaajan kiya jaataa he use labhaansh kehete he
 Every trading company has the cumulative right to distribute dividends
 sanchaalak is baat kii sifarish karte hai ki kitni raashi labhaansh ke rup main ghoshit kii jaae
 Thereafter, the company declares a dividend in its general meeting, but this amount should not exceed the amount recommended by the operators
 iske atirikt antarniyamon dwaara adhikrut hone par sanchaalak do saamaanya baithkon ke bich main hi antarim labhaansh kii ghoshnaa bhi kar sakate he
 Generally, dividend is only part of the profit of the company, hence it can be given only by profit and not from capital
 labhaansh ke vishay main anshadhariyon ke saamaanya adhikaron, jaise labhaansh kii dar tathaa purvadhikaar aadi kaa prakathan kabhi kabhi simanim main hi kar diya jaataa he jisase yathasambhav, un adhikaron main parivartan na ho sake
 Sometimes they are disclosed in the articles and sometimes in both the documents
 kis dhang se labhaansh kii ghoshnaa tathaa adaayagi kii jaaegi, iskaa prakathan saadharantaya antarniyamon main hi hota he
 As long as the company is in operation, it is not obliged to distribute the entire profit to the shareholders
 labhaansh vitaran karne ke sthaan par, antarniyamon main isaki vyavastha hone par yah apane laabh ko poonji main parivartit kar sakati he
 The dividend is considered a loan from the day of its declaration and becomes due
 kabhi kabhi antarniyamon main yah bhi praavdhaan hota he ki ghoshnaa ke baad nishchit samay tak labhaansh ke ayaachit rahane par ise jabt kiya ja saktaa he
 Members of the company can request dividends as per the rules of the articles, but it is necessary that the names of such members are recorded in the register of the company on the day of declaration of dividend
 jab anshon kaa hastantaran labhaansh ghoshit karne par uske bahut nikat kis tithi ko ho, to hastantarak tathaa hastantari yah bhi sanvida kar sakate hai ki labhaansh kisko mili
 Dividends are mainly of three types: cash dividend kaa bhugtan check ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Thus the shareholder has to pay tax on the income earned
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan len, to yadi kisi vyakti ke paas 1000 share hai or yadi unka cash dividend mulya 1 rupee hai to use dividend ke rup main 1000 rupee milenge
 In a stock dividend, the company gives more shares in return for the profit the shareholder gets
 is dividand ke udhaaharan swaroop 1000 share rakhane vaale ko paanch pratishat kaa dividend laabh hone par company use paanch atirikt share degi
 The company gives any asset to the shareholder as a dividend earner in the property dividend, but the company rarely gives such dividend
 yah purnataya shairdharak kii ichha par nirbhar karata he ki dividend ke rup main mili hue share ko apane paas rakhe yaa unhen bech de
 There is a fixed date for declaring a dividend, which is announced by the board of directors of the company
 niveshak ke liye dividend laabh kaa sauda hota he kyonki uske dwaara niveshit rakam ke dividend ke rup main mil jane kii guarantee ke kaaran laabh kii sthiti main rahata he
 Investors have high confidence in the stock which gives dividend returns
 niveshak ko milane vaala labhaansh kar-mukt hota he
 Although it varies by individual, interest is taxed
 aisa isaliye hai, kyonki byaaj ko kharch mana jaataa he or labhaansh ko niveshak kaa laabh maanate hai
 If the company has paid tax on its income, including dividends, then it will be double taxed by paying tax on dividends
 isi kaaran se 1997 main labhaansh ko karmukt kar diya gaya tha
 Recently several companies such as Dabur, Financial Technology, Dabur and Crampton Greaves etc
 and PSU SAIL, GAIL, Nalco had announced tax free dividend for their shareholders
 is prakaar kar ke bachaav ke liye labhaansh laabhprad hota he
 There are several reasons for this: privet limited companiyon main mukhya shairdharakon ko adhik labhaansh kaa laabh miltaa he, kyonki isse unke adhik kar kii bachat ho jaati he

 According to the Puranas, Sati had jumped into Havanakund due to the insult of her husband Shiva in the Yajna of Father Daksha, whose body kept shifting on Shiva's shoulder for a long time
 sati ke ang jahaan-jahaan gire vahaan-vahaan shaktipeeth ban gaye jo shakt tathaa shaiva bhakton ke param tirth hue
 One of these peeths - Kamarupa was established in Assam, which is situated on a hill called 'kamakhya' in front of today's Gauhati
 pashchimi bharat main jo kamaroop kii nari shakti ke anek alokik chamatkaaron kii baat loksahitya main kahi gai he, uskaa aadhaar is kamakshi kaa mahatv hi he
 The meaning of 'kamarupa' is to 'take the form at will' and believe that the women of Assam could be transformed into whatever they wanted
 assam ke purvi bhaag main atyant pracheen kaal se nari kii shakti kii archana hui he
 The female kingdom of that direction is mentioned in the Mahabharata

 In such an environment it was only natural for the Goddess to be everlasting and when she was accepted as the consort of Shiva, the Shakti sect readily acquired the background and dignity of Shaiv shakti
 phir jab vajrayani pragnaparmita or shakti ek kar di gayi tab to shakti gaurav kaa or bhi prasar ho gaya
 The center of that Shakti faith is this Kamakshi Peet of Kamakhya hill in Gohati

 This was the reason that when the anti-salt law movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1930, he personally handed over the responsibility of the Sangh chief to Dr
 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr

 rajyasabha kaa pehla satr 13 may 1952 ko hua tha
 Rajya Sabha is a name that was announced on 23 August 1954 in the House by the Chair
 isaki apni khaas visheshtaayen hai
 The Second House in India began with the 1918 montague-chelmsford Report
 bharat sarkaar adhinium, 1919 main tatkaaleen vidhanmandal ke dwitiya sadan ke taur par council of stats kaa srijan karne kaa upbandh kiya gaya jiskaa visheshadhikaar simit tha or jo vastut: 1921 main astitv main aayaa

 The Constituent Assembly, which first met on 9 December 1946, also served as the Central Legislature until 1950, then it was converted into a 'provisional Parliament'
 is avadhi ke dauraan, kendriya vidhanmandal jise 'samvidhan sabha' or aage chalakar 'anantim sansad' kaha gaya, 1952 main pehle chunaav karaae jane tak, ek-sadani rahaa
 There was a wide debate in the Constituent Assembly regarding the usefulness or inefficiency of the Second House in independent India, and ultimately the decision to create a bicameral legislature for independent India was mainly because the federal system was considered the most for such a large country with immense diversities
 It was considered a natural form of government
 vastut:, ek pratyaksh rup se nirvaachit ekal sabha ko swatantra bharat ke samaksh aane vaali chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye aparyaapt samajha gaya
 Hence, a second house known as the 'council of States' was created whose structure and electoral system was completely different from the directly elected Lok Sabha
 ise ek aisa anya sadan samajha gaya, jisaki sadsy sankhya lok sabha se kam he
 It was meant to be a confederate house, ie an assembly which was elected by the elected members of the states and the assemblies of the two union territories in which the states were not given equal representation
 nirvaachit sadasyon ke alaava, raashtrapati dwaara sabha ke liye baarah sadasyon ke namanirdesan kaa bhi upbandh kiya gaya
 The minimum age for its membership was fixed at thirty years while for the lower house it is twenty five years
 council of stats kii sabha main garima or pratishtha ke avyav sanyojit kiye gaye
 This was done by making the Vice President of India the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its meetings
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 80 main rajya sabha ke sadasyon kii adhiktam sankhya 250 nirdhaarit kii gai he, jinamein se 12 sadsy raashtrapati dwaara namanirdeshit kiye jate hai or 238 sadsy rajyon ke or sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhi hote hai
 However, the current strength of Rajya Sabha is 245, out of which 233 are representatives of the Member States and the Union Territory of Delhi and Puducherry and 12 are nominated by the President
 raashtrapati dwaara namanirdeshit kiye jane vaale sadsy aise vyakti honge jinhen sahitya, vigyaan, kala or samaaj seva jaise vishyon ke sambandh main vishesh gyaan yaa vyaavhaarik anubhav he
 The Fourth Schedule to the Constitution provides for allocation of seats to the States and Union Territories in the Rajya Sabha
 sthanon kaa aavanton prayek rajya kii jansankhya ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 As a result of the reorganization of states and the formation of new states, the number of elected seats in the Rajya Sabha allotted to the States and Union Territories has been changing from time to time since 1952
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 84 main sansad kii sadsyta ke liye arhataaen nirdhaarit kii gai hai
 To qualify for membership of Rajya Sabha, a person must have the following qualifications: use bharat kaa naagarik hona chahie or nirvachan ayog dwaara is nimitt praadhikrut kisi vyakti ke samaksh teesri anusuchee main is prayojan ke liye die gaye praroop ke anusaar shapath lenaa chahie yaa pratigyaan karnaa chahie or us par apane hastakshar karne chahie; He must be at least thirty years of age; uske paas aisi anya arhataaen honi chahie jo sansad dwaara banaai gai kisi vidhi dwaara yaa uske adheen is nimitt vihit kii jaaen

 In addition, the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution provides for disqualification of members on the basis of change of party
 dasvin anusuchee ke upbandhon ke anusaar, koi sadsy ek sadsy ke rup main us dasha main nirarhit hoga, yadi vah swechha se apane raajnneetik dal kii sadsyta chhod detaa he; yaa vah aise raajnneetik dal dwaara, jiskaa vah sadsy he, die gaye kisi nidesh ke viruddh sadan main matdaan karata he yaa matdaan karne se virat rahata he or aise matdaan yaa matdaan karne se virat rahane ko us raajnneetik dal dwaara pandraa din ke bheetar maaf nahin kiya gaya he
 a member elected as an independent candidate will be disqualified if he joins any political party after his election
 tathaapi, raashtrapati dwaara sadan ke kisi namanirdeshit sadsy ko kisi raajnneetik dal main sammilit hone kii anumati hogi yadi vah sadan main apana sthaan grahan karne ke pehle chah maas ke bheetar aisa karata / karti he
 a member will not be disqualified on this basis if he / she voluntarily relinquishes membership of his / her political party after being elected Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 rajya sabha main rajyon or sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhiyon kaa nirvachan apratyaksh nirvachan paddati dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The representatives of each state and two union territories are elected according to the proportional representation system by a single transferable vote by the elected members of the legislative assembly of that state and the members of the electoral college of that union territory, as the case may be
 dilli rashtriya rajdhani kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal main dilli vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadsy or puducheri sangh rajya kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal main puducheri vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadsy shaamil hai
 The Rajya Sabha is a permanent house and does not dissolve
 tathaapi, prayek do varsh baad rajya sabha ke ek-tihaai sadsy seva-nivrutt ho jate hai
 a member elected for a full-time term serves for a term of six years
 kisi sadsy ke kaarykaal kii samaapti par sevanivritti ko chhodkar anyathaa utpann hui rikti ko bharne ke liye karaayaa gaya nirvachan 'up-chunaav' kehalaata he
 a member elected in a by-election may remain a member for the remainder of the term of the member who had resigned or died or who was disqualified to be a member of the House under the Tenth Schedule
 rajya sabha ke peethasin adhikariyon kii yah jimmedaari hoti he ki ve sabha kii kaarywahi kaa sanchaalan karen
 The Vice President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 rajya sabha ke sadasyon ke vipareet rajyasabha ke sabhapati kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon kaa hi hota he, rajya sabha apane sadasyon main se ek upasabhapati kaa bhi chayan karti he
 The Rajya Sabha also consists of a panel of Deputy Speaker, whose members are nominated by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha
 sabhapati or upasabhapati kii anupasthiti main, upsabhadhyakshon ke panel se ek sadsy sabha kii kaarywahi kaa sabhapatitv karata he
 Unlike the Lok Sabha, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha gives his resignation not to the Deputy Chairman but to the President
 mahasachiv kii niyukti rajya sabha ke sabhapati dwaara kii jaati he or unka rank sangh ke sarvocch civil sevak ke samatuly hota he
 The secretary-general works anonymously and is readily available to the Presiding Officers for advice on parliamentary matters
 mahasachiv rajya sabha sachivalay ke prashasnic pramukh or sabha ke abhilekhon ke sangrakshak bhi hai
 He works under the direction and control of the Chairman, Rajya Sabha
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 75 ke adheen, mantri parishad samuhik rup se lok sabha ke prati jimmedaar hoti he jiskaa aashay yah he ki rajya sabha sarkaar ko bana yaa gira nahin sakati he
 However, it can control the government and this task becomes especially important when the government does not get majority in Rajya Sabha
 kisi saamaanya vidhaan kii dasha main, donon sabhaaon ke bich gatirodh dur karne ke liye, samvidhan main donon sabhaaon kii sanyukt baithak bulaane kaa upbandh he
 In fact, there have been three such occasions in the past when Parliament meetings were held jointly to resolve differences between them
 sanyukt baithak main uthaaye jane vaale muddon kaa nirnay donon sabhaaon main upasthit or mat dene vaale sadasyon kii kul sankhya ke bahumat se kiya jaataa he
 The joint meeting is held in the Central Hall of Parliament House which is presided over by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
 tathaapi, dhan vidheyak kii dasha main, samvidhan main donon sabhaaon kii sanyukt baithak bulaane kaa koi upbandh nahin he, kyonki lok sabha ko vittiya maamalon main rajya sabha kii tulana main pramukhataa hasil he
 In relation to the Constitution Amendment Bill, the Constitution provides that such a Bill has to be passed by both the Houses by a specific majority, as prescribed under Article 368 of the Constitution
 at:, samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke sambandh main donon sabhaaon ke bich gatirodh ko dur karne kaa koi upbandh nahin he
 Ministers can be from any House of Parliament
 is sambandh main samvidhan sabhaaon ke bich koi bhed nahin karata he
 Every minister has the right to speak in any assembly and to participate in its proceedings, but he is entitled to vote in the same assembly of which he is a member
 isi prakaar, sansad kii sabhaaon, unke sadasyon or unki samitiyon kii shaktiyon, visheshadhikaron or unmuktiyon ke sambandh main, donon sabhaaon ko samvidhan dwaara bilkul samaan dharaatal par rakhaa gaya he
 Other important matters in respect of which the two Houses have similar powers are: - Election and impeachment of the President, Election of vice-president, approval of Proclamation of Emergency, Proclamation related to failure of constitutional machinery in States and Financial Emergency
 vibhinn sanvaidhanik praadhikaranon aadi se prativedan tathaa patr praapt karne ke sambandh main, donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai
 Thus, it is clear that the two Houses have equal powers except in the case of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers and certain financial matters which fall under the jurisdiction of the Lok Sabha only
 ek parisangheey sadan hone ke naate rajya sabha ko samvidhan ke adheen kuch vishesh shaktiyaan praapt hai
 The Rajya Sabha has three special powers
 vidhaan se sambandhit sabhi vishyon / kshetron ko teen soochiyon main vibhajit kiya gaya he- sangh suchi, rajya suchi or samavarti suchi
 Union and state lists are mutually excluded - no one can legislate on a subject placed in the territory of another
 tathaapi, yadi rajya sabha upasthit or mat dene vaale sadasyon main se kam se kam do-tihaai sadasyon ke bahumat dwaara yah kehete hue ek sankalp paarit karti he ki yah "rashtriya hit main aavashyak yaa samichin" he ki sansad, rajya suchi main pramanit kisi vishay par vidhi banaae, to sansad bharat ke sampurna rajya-kshetra yaa uske kisi bhaag ke liye us sankalp main vinirdisht vishay par vidhi banane hetu adhikaar-sampann ho jaati he
 Such a resolution will be in force for a period of one year but this period can be extended again for one year by passing a similar resolution
 yadi rajya sabha upasthit or mat dene vaale sadasyon main se kam se kam do-tihaai sadasyon ke bahumat dwaara yah ghoshit karte hue ek sankalp paarit karti he ki sangh or rajyon ke liye sammilit ek yaa adhik akhil bhartiya sevaaon kaa srijan kiya janaa rashtriya hit main aavashyak yaa samichin he, to sansad vidhi dwaara aisi sevaaon kaa srijan karne ke liye adhikaar-sampann ho jaati he
 Under the Constitution, the President has the right to issue proclamations in the event of national emergency, in the event of failure of constitutional machinery in a state or in case of financial emergency
 aisi prayek udghoshnaa ko sansad kii donon sabhaaon dwaara niyat avadhi ke bheetar anumodith kiya janaa anivaary he
 However, the Rajya Sabha has special powers in this regard under certain circumstances
 yadi koi udghoshnaa us samay kii jaati he jab lok sabha kaa vighatan ho gaya he athwa lok sabha kaa vighatan iske anumodan ke liye anugnaat avadhi ke bheetar ho jaataa he or yadi ise anumodith karne vaala sankalp rajya sabha dwaara anuchhed 352, 356 or 360 ke adheen samvidhan main vinirdisht avadhi ke bheetar paarit kar diya jaataa he, tab vah udghoshnaa prabhavi rahegi
 Money Bill can be introduced only in Lok Sabha
 iske us sabha dwaara paarit kiye jane ke uparant ise rajya sabha ko uski sahmati athwa sifarish ke liye pareshit kiya jaataa he
 The power of Rajya Sabha in respect of such a bill is limited
 rajya sabha ko aise vidheyak kii prapti se chaudaa din ke bheetar use lok sabha ko lautaanaa padataa he
 If it is not returned to the Lok Sabha within that period, the Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form in which it was passed by the Lok Sabha at the end of the said period
 rajya sabha dhan vidheyak main sanshodhan bhi nahin kar sakati; yah keval sanshodhano kii sifarish kar sakati he or lok sabha, rajya sabha kii sabhi yaa kinhin siforeeshon ko sweekaar athwa asweekaar kar sakegi
 Apart from Money Bills, certain other categories of Finance Bills also cannot be introduced in Rajya Sabha
 tathaapi, kuch anya prakaar ke vitt vidheyak hai jinke sambandh main rajya sabha kii shaktiyon par koi nirbandhan nahin he
 These Bills can be introduced in any House and the Rajya Sabha has the right to reject or amend such Finance Bills like any other Bill
 vastut: aise vidheyak sansad kii kisi bhi sabha dwaara tab tak paarit nahin kiye ja sakate, jab tak raashtrapati ne us par vichaar karne ke liye us sabha se sifarish nahin kii ho
 However, all these things do not lead to the conclusion that the Rajya Sabha has nothing to do with matters related to finance
 bharat sarkaar ke bajet ko prativarsh rajya sabha ke samaksh bhi rakhaa jaataa he or iske sadsygan us par charchaa karte hai
 Although the Rajya Sabha does not vote on the Demands for Grants of the various Ministries - the matter is exclusively reserved for the Lok Sabha
 However, no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India unless the appropriation bill by both the Houses
 Is not passed
 isi prakaar, vitt vidheyak ko bhi rajya sabha ke samaksh laayaa jaataa he
 In addition, Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committees, which examine the annual grant demands of Ministries / Departments, are joint committees consisting of ten members from the Rajya Sabha
 sabhapati or upasabhapati ke alaava, sabha kaa netaa ek anya aisa adhikari he jo sabha ke kushal or sucharu sanchaalan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha is usually the Prime Minister, if he is a member of it, or a Minister who is a member of this House and who has been nominated by him to act as such
 uskaa praathmik uttardaayitv sabha main sauhardpurn or sarthak vaad-vivaad ke liye sabha ke sabhi virgon ke bich samanvay banaae rakhana he
 For this purpose, he remains in close contact not only with the government, but also with the opposition, ministers and the presiding officer
 vah sabha-kaksh main sabhapith ke daayin ore kii pehali pankti main pehali seat par baithta he taaki vah paraamarsh hetu peethasin adhikari ko sahaj uplabdh rahe
 Under the rules, the arrangement of official business in the House by the Chairman, allocation of days or time for discussion on the President's address, non-official members' work on any day other than Friday, discussion on resolutions on non-days, short-term discussion And the Leader of the House is consulted regarding the consideration and withdrawal of any Money Bill
 mahaan vyaktitv, rashtriya netaa athwa anterrashtriya pratishthit vyakti kii mrityu hone kii sthiti main us din ke liye sabha ke sthagan athwa anyathaa ke maamle main sabhapati unase bhi paraamarsh kar sakate hai
 In the era of coalition governments, their task has become more challenging
 vah yah sunishchit karte hai ki sabha ke samaksh laaye gaye kisi bhi maamle par sarthak charchaa ke liye sabha main har sambhav tathaa uchit suvidha pradaan kii jaae
 He acts as the speaker of the House in expressing the opinion of the House and presenting it on ceremonies or formal occasions
 nimnlikhit sadsy rajya sabha main sabha ke netaa rahe hai: The position of Leader of the Opposition in the legislature has immense public importance
 iskaa mahatv sansadeey loktantr main vipaksh ko di gai mukhya bhoomika se udbhoot hota he
 The task of the Leader of the Opposition is in fact extremely difficult because they have to criticize, point out mistakes and submit alternative proposals / policies which they have no right to implement
 is prakaar unhen sansad or desh ke prati ek vishesh saamaajik jimmedaari nibhaani hoti he
 In the Rajya Sabha till 1969 there was no leader of the opposition in real sense
 us samay tak sarvaadhik sadasyon vaali vipakshi party ke netaa ko bina kisi aupchaarik manyata, darja yaa visheshadhikaar die vipakshi netaa maanane kii pratha thi
 The post of Leader of the Opposition was given official recognition in Parliament by the Opposition Leader Salary and Allowances Act, 1977
 is adhinium ke dwaara rajya sabha main vipakshi netaa, rajya sabha kaa ek aisa sadsy hota he jo kuch samay ke liye rajya sabha ke sabhapati dwaara yatha maanya sabase adhik sadasyon vaale dal kii sarkaar ke vipaksh main hota he
 Thus the leader of the opposition has to fulfill three conditions, namely: verma varman yaa burman) hindu dharm kaa ek jati suchak upnaam he jise vartmaan bharatvarsh evam dakshin purv asia main nivas karne vaale sabhi hindu apane naam ke aage garv se likhte hai
 Varma is written mainly by people born from Kshatriya varna, but in this era of modernity, people of other castes have started applying this surname in front of their names
 verma va iske anya samanarthak upnaam kaa shabdic arth he dhaal yaa suraksha
 Therefore, this surname was often used by the Kshatriyas or Rajputs who participated in the war
 haalanki urisa praant main rahane vaale kuch brahman varna ke log bhi, yah jaanate hue bhi ki yah upnaam kshatriyon ke liye hi nirdhaarit he, apane naam ke aage verma, varman yaa burman lagaate hai
 Some of the elite or notable people who write the surname Varma, Varman or Burman in front of their names are given here
 aasturiyas madhya yug main aasturiyas samrajya naam kaa swatantra raashtra hua karata tha
 Asturias has a dialect named Asturianu

 Its port and largest city are Gishon and the most important industrial city is Aviles
 yah bien de interes cultural kii suchi he jo ki asturiyas, spain main maujuud hai: The story of Karunavati, the twenty-fourth effigy, is as follows: King Vikramaditya's entire time was spent in relieving the sufferings of his subjects
 praja kii kisi bhi samasya ko ve andekha nahin karte the
 He was aware of all the problems, so in disguise, he roamed the entire state at night, today in some part, tomorrow in someone else
 unki is aadat kaa pataa chor-daakuon ko bhi tha, isliye aparaadh kii ghatnaayen chhit-put hi hua karti thim
 Vikram wanted that crime should be eradicated so that people could travel fearlessly from one place to another and sleep peacefully
 aise hi vikram ek raat vesh badalakar rajya ke ek hisse main gum rahe the ki unhen ek bade bhawan se latakta ek kamand nazar aayaa
 With the help of this lamb, surely a thief must have gone to the top floor, thinking that he reached the top with the help of the lamb
 unhone apni talwaar haathon main le lee taaki saamana hone par chor ko maut ke ghat utaar saken
 At that point, they heard Sree's slow voice, "so Chor Koi Sree Hai", thinking they stood close to the wall of the room from where the voice was coming
 koi sree kisi se bagal vaale kamare main jaakar kisi kaa vadh karne ko kah rahi thi
 He said that it is impossible to have a relationship with anyone else without killing the man
 tabhi ek purush swar bolaa ki vah luteraa avashya he, magar kisi nirparaadh vyakti kii jaan lenaa uske liye sambhav nahi he
 He was telling Sree to go to a remote place with him and was trying to convince him that he had so much money that the rest of his life would be settled
 vah sree ant main usase duusare din aane ke liye boli, kyonki use dhan batorne main kam se kam choubees ghante lag jate
 The king understood that the man is the lover of the woman and the woman is the wife of the lady whose house is this
 seth bagal vaale kamare main so rahaa he or sethaani uske vadh ke liye apane premi ko uksaa rahi thi
 King Kamand caught hold and came down and waited for that lover
 thodi der baad sethaani kaa premi kamand se neeche aayaa to raja ne apni talwaar uski gardan par rakh di tathaa use bataa diya ki uske saamne vikram khadey hai
 The man trembled with fear and his girdle was tied to the fear of death
 jab raja ne use sach bataane par mrityu dand na dene kaa vaayada kiya to usne apni kahani is prakaar bataai- "I loved him from childhood and had dreams of marriage with him
 mere paas bhi bahut sara dhan tha kyonki mere pita ek bahut hi bade vyapaaree the
 But all my dreams of a happy future remained intact
 ek din mere pitaaji kaa dhan se bharaa jahaaj samudri daakuon ne lut liya
 On receiving the news of the robbery, my father's heart was shocked that his life died
 ham log kangaal ho gaae
 i assumed the cause of my destruction and took revenge on those pirates
 kai varshon tak thokar khaane ke baad mujhe unka pataa chal hi gaya
 i barely won his trust and joined his team
 avasar pate hi main kisi ek kaa vadh kar detaa
 One by one i wiped out the entire crew and returned to my house with the money they had collected from the loot
 ghar aakar mujhe pataa chalaa ki ek dhani seth se meri premika kaa vivaah ho gaya or vah apane pati ke saath chali gai
 All my dreams were shattered
 ek din uske maayke aane kii khabar mujhe mili to main khush ho gaya
 She came to meet me and i told her the whole story
 ek din vah mujhase mili to usne kaha ki use mere paas bahut sara dhan hone kii baat par tabhi vishwaas hoga jab main naulakha haar uske gale main daal don
 i went with a necklace worth nine lakh rupees
 tab tak vah pati ke paas chali gai thi
 When i brought the Naulakha necklace and put it in her husband's house, she encouraged me to kill her husband
 maine uskaa kehane nahin mana kyonki kisi nirparaadh kii hatya apane haathon se karnaa main bhayanak paap samajhataa hoon
 " raja vikramaditya ne sach bolne ke liye uski tarif kii or samudri daakuon kaa safaya karne ke liye uskaa kandhaa thapthapaayaa
 They scolded him for not understanding the Tria character
 unhone kaha ki sachhee premicaaye premi se prem karti hai uske dhan se nahin
 His girlfriend did not wait for him and married the rich man
 dubaara usase bhent hone par pati se droh karne se nahin hichkichai
 Even after getting Naulakha defeat, she did not believe him and agreed to walk with him
 ulate uske manaa karne par bhi usase nirparaadh pati kii hatya karwaane ko taiyaar baithi he
 Love with such a cruel and characterless woman will only lead to destruction
 vah aadmi rota hua raja ke charnon main gir padaa tathaa apana aparaadh kshamaa karne ke liye prarthana karne laga
 In return for the death penalty, the king gave him many awards for bravery and truthfulness
 us aadmi kii ankhen khul chuki thim
 On the second day, disguised as the lover, he reached his girlfriend with the help of Kamanda
 unke pahonchte hi us sree ne svarnabhushanon kii badi si thili unhen apana premi samajhakar pakadaa di or boli ki usne vish khilaakar seth ko maar diya or saare svarnabhushan or heere jawaharaat chunakar is thili main bhar liye
 When the king did not say anything, he got suspicious and took a fake beard-mustache
 kisi anya purush ko paakar "chor-chor" chillane lagi tathaa raja ko apane pati kaa hatyara bataakar vilaap karne lagi
 The king's soldiers and the city Kotwal were hidden below

 It did not take long for the woman to understand that the half-changed men were disguised themselves

 However other researchers, including Ian Wilmut, who led the team successfully replicating Dolly, argue that Dolly's death at a young age due to respiratory infections had no relation to the deficiencies in the impersonation process

 This novel has been considered as one of the best novels in Hindi literature
 yah upanyaas do bhaagon main vibhajit he
 Its first part 'watan aur Desh' was published in 1958 AD from Viplav Office, Lucknow and the second part 'desh ka Bhavishya' was published in 1960 AD
 iske pehle bhaag main lahore ke bholaa paandhe kii gali ke pariwaron ke bahaane jan saamaanya ke jivan kaa chithran karte hue desh ke vibhaajan evam usase utpann bheeshan sampradayik dange aadi kaa chithran karte hue sharnaarthiyon ke ek desh chhodkar duusare main palaayan kii vivashtaa tak kaa chithran kiya gaya he
 In the second part, the indicative depiction of the deficiencies in the creation of the country, the corruption of leaders, the deviation of revolutionary consciousness, the middle class trapped in the tragedy of selfishness Lipsa and the decisive power of the people in spite of all this has been done on a wide pane
 jhootha sach ke pramukh paatr hai jayadev puri, uski bahan tara or jayadev puri kii patni kanak
 Tara and Jaidev are a family of Puri, Kanaka's second family
 in donon parivaar kii kahaniyon ke madhyam se upanyaas kii kahani aage badhati he or atyadhik vistaar main jaakar bahuaiami ho jaati he
 The story of the false truth has been woven as the backdrop of the horrific riots that took place during the independence of India in 1947
 british aupniveshikta, uski 'foot daalo or raaj karo' kii niti tathaa muslim lig ke 'do raashtra kaa siddhant' se milakar brihattar bhartiya samaaj main swatah maujuud chuaachhut kii nimna bhaavana evam sampradayikta kii dabi chetana aisi ubhari ki puraa bharat varsh aisi jwaala se dadhak uthaa jiskaa koi doosraa udhaaharan nahin mil paata he

 At the end of this part, the driver of a bus carrying refugees says "rabb whom he had made one, Rabb's captors made them two with their splendor and oppression
 " The second section of 'false Truth', in the 'future of the Country', marks the progressive and regressive role of intellectuals and leaders in the development and future construction of the country in the decade after independence

 That is why Yashpal draws various situations, does not make a linear or idealistic depiction of a character, because it is possible to do this in practical life, but it is often not possible
 is upanyaas main desh kii duravastha ke liye janata kii andruni kamajoriyon evam nirjeevta ko bhi kaaphi uttaradaayi dikhalaayaa gaya he
 However, by the end of the novel, it is proved that this depiction has actually been done with the objective of correctly identifying the situation

 This novel is in fact a well-written saga of the rise and fall of a larger mass-society divided in different religions and classes, depicted with the center of division
 vibhaajan se pehle logon ke man main utpann hone vaale vighatanvaadee bhav tathaa vibhaajan ke baad desh athwa shashan ke sanghatan ke liye aavashyak samarpan evam sooyeeboojh main hone vaali kami -- donon par sookshm drushti rakhte hue yashpal ne is upanyaas kaa taana bana buna he
 In this novel, Yashpal has depicted how communal consciousness affects human destiny far and how the distressing of circumstances can turn the revolutionary consciousness inherent in the masses towards selfishness Lipsa
 bharat kaa madhya varg krantikari chetana se yukt hokar puunjipati varg ke paakhand kii aalochana karte hue bhi kis prakaar swayan vaisaa hi jivan jeene kii tragedy kii ore badhate jaataa he, iskaa aupnyasik rachaav dekhne yogya he
 The creative formation of the novel is so efficient that the epistemology of this epic novel is considered to be inherent in the mystery that in its narrative structure it becomes difficult to decide that 'false truth' is the account of the partition of the country under the pretext of Tara's destiny story
 Or that Tara's destiny is as a result of the partition of the country
 upanyaas main tara swayan karti he- "mere bhagya ke kaaran desh kaa bantwaaraa hua yaa desh ke bhagya ke kaaran meri durgati hui
 " dow0 ramvilas sharma yashpal ke ghor virdohi ke rup main maane jate hai, parantu unhone sambhawatah sabase pehle yah ghoshit kar diya tha ki 'jhootha sach' yashpal ji ke upanyaason main sarvshereshth he

 Poet Kunwar Narayan wrote a review of this novel under the title 'lack of Poetry'
 iske bainks anand prakaash kaa spasht mat he ki is upanyaas kaa ek bahut bada gun he isaki rochakata or atyadhik saahitiyikta
 


 Yes, Yashpal has been successful enough to relate the unmistakable portrayal of 'social environment' and 'historical reality' to mostly correct literary understanding and expression
 sivakumar mishra ke anusaar 'jhootha sach' ko pathakon kii vyapak saraahna mili
 Allegations of 'news cuttings' came from here and there, but Ramesh Kuntal Megh correctly identified his creative nature by calling him 'history written as art'

 In the context of the various allegations made on this novel, Ramdarash Mishra ji believes that there are many things but i think that the author has made a very beautiful harmony of the depth, modern destiny and value of the then events and circumstances and the depth of human inner truths
 is

 This creative vision on the one hand inspires the writer to see the true form of reality, on the other hand, since it is the surgeon's vision, seeing events and facts as they are, they see them in the context of human truths and from within Manufactures something
 prastut mahakavyatmak upanyaas main yashpal kii drushti ne kahin saath nahin choda he, vah aarpaardarshee he or use is baat kii pahchaan he ki kya hokar bhi jhooth he or kya naa hokar bhi sahi he
 The author is a Marxist, but in this novel, his Marxist ideology is not dominant in itself and is supportive of his artistic vision

 In many ways, it is also the antithesis of the well-known discussions and dominance of partition of India
 is upanyaas kii sabase badi khubi yah he ki na to yah sarhad ke is paar ke lekhak kii rachana lagati he or na hi kisi purush lekhak kii
 


 there is no doubt that 'false truth' has the status of 'classic' in Hindi novels, but it is necessary to know the reasons for which it is in the category of 'classic'
 isliye aavashyak he iskaa padhaa janaa
 In response to the allegations leveled by Kunwar Narayan ji, Madhuresh, considered Yashpal's authentic commentator, wrote a detailed review article titled "false Truth": Epic in the novel and declared that giving an analytical answer to the allegations of Kunwar Narayan Ji 'false truth' is accepted as one of the best works of Yashpal, he is also one of the ten best and notable novels in Hindi

 farade ke dwitiya niyam ke liye, Q, F, tathaa z niyatank hai; at: m / z jitna hi adhik hoga, m bhi utana hi adhik hoga
 If a simple situation is spoken in which the electric current is fixed, then q = i t { \ displaystyle q = It} and
