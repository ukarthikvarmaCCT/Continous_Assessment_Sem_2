 After Chaplin's first film appearance, Making a Living was made, Sennett felt he had made a big expensive mistake
 zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki normand ne unhen chaplin ko ek or mauka dene ke liye manaaya tha
 Chaplin was assigned to Normand, who directed and wrote some of his first films

 As the structure of a narrative emerged by accepting and discarding ideas, Chaplin often needed to shoot back the entire issue in advance, which would otherwise contradict the story

 The name Surdas is paramount among the devout poets who flow the Ajsara stream of Krishna devotion
 hindi sahitya main bhagwaan shrikrishna ke anany upaask or brajabhasha ke shreshth kavi mahatma surdaas hindi sahitya ke surya maane jate hai
 The unique poetry of Kamini in Hindi poetry has contributed to enriching the Hindi language is unique
 surdaas hindi sahitya main bhakthi kaal ke sagun bhakthi shakha ke krishna-bhakthi upashakha ke mahaan kavi hai
 Surdas was born in 1478 AD in a village called Runkata
 yah gaanv mathura-agra maarg ke kinare sthit he
 Some scholars believe that Sur was born in a poor Saraswat Brahmin family in a village called Sihi
 baad main ye agra or mathura ke bich gaughat par aakar rahane lage the
 Surdas's father, Ramdas, was a singer
 surdaas ke janmaandh hone ke vishay main matbhed he
 Initially, Surdas lived at Gaughat near Agra
 vahiin unki bhent shri vallabhacharya se hui or ve unke shishy ban gaye
 Vallabhacharya initiated him in Pushtimarga and ordered him to sing the post of Krishnalila
 surdaas kii mrityu govardhan ke nikat parsauli gram main 1580 isvi main hui
 Becoming Surdadas? madan mohan ek bahut hi sundar or tej buddhi ke navayuvak the vah har din nadi ke kinare ja kar baith jaataa or geet likhata 
 One day there was a sentence that charmed his mind
 hua ye kii ek sundar navayuvati nadi kinare kapadey dho rahi thi madan mohan kaa dhyaan uski taraf chalaa gaya 
 The girl attracted Madan Mohan so much that he stopped writing poetry
 tathaa pure dhyaan se us yuvati ko dekhne laga 
 He felt as if Radhika was sitting on the banks of the Yamuna
 us navayuvati ne bhi madan mohan kii taraf dekha or unke paas aakar boli aap madan mohan ji ho naa? to vah bole haa main madan mohan hoon
 i write poems and sing, i saw you and stopped
 navayuvati ne poocha kyon ? to vah bole aap ho hi itani sundar 
 This sequence lasted for several days
 jab yah baat madan mohan ke pita ko pataa chali to unako bahut krodh aayaa 
 Then Madan Mohan also left home
 par us sundar yuvati kaa cheharaa unke saamne se nahin ja rahaa tha ek din vah mandir me baithe the tabhi vah ek shaadishuda bahut hi sundar stri aae 
 Madan Mohan followed them
 jab vah uske ghar pahunche to uske pati ne darwaja kholaa tathaa pure aadar samaann ke saath unhen andar bithaaya 
 Then Mandan Mohan asked for two burning strings and put it in his eye
 is tarah madan mohan bane mahaan kavi surdaas 
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding Surdas's date of birth and birthplace
 "sahitya lahari' sur kii likhi rachana maani jaati he
 In this, the following position is found in relation to the creation period of Sahitya Lahiri - iskaa arth sanwat 1607 isvi main mana gaya he, atev "sahitya lahari' kaa rachana kaal sanwat 1607 vi0 he
 This text also provides evidence that Guru of Sur was Sri Ballabhacharya
 surdaas kaa janm san0 1535 isvi ke lagbhag thahartaa he, kyonki ballab sampradaay main aisi manyata he ki ballabhacharya surdaas se das din bade the or ballabhacharya kaa janm ukt sanwat kii baishakh krishna ekadshi ko hua tha
 Therefore, the birth date of Surdas seems to be Vaishakh Shukla Panchami, Samvat 1535 V, expedient
 anek pramaanon ke aadhaar par unka mrityu sanwat 1620 se 1648 isvi ke madhya sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Ramchandra Shukla ji, Surdas is believed to be born around 1540 AD and death year around 1620 AD
 surdaas kii aayu "surasaravali' ke anusaar us samay 67 varsh thi
 He was born in the field of Runukta or Renu on the basis of 'chaurasi Vaishnavan talks'
 mathura or agra ke bich gaughat par ye nivas karte the
 He met Ballabhacharya right there
 "bhavaprakash' main sur kaa janm sthaan sihi naamak gram bataaya gaya he
 He was a Saraswat Brahmin and blind of birth
 "aaine akabari' main tathaa "mutkhbut-tavaarikh' ke anusaar surdaas ko akbar ke darbari sangitagnon main mana he
 Surdas Srinath's "sanskritavarta Manipala", Shri Hariray's "bhava-prakash", Sri Gokulnath's "nijavarta" etc
 are considered blind births
 lekin radha-krishna ke rup soundarya kaa sajiv chithran, naanaa rangon kaa varnan, sookshm paryvekshanshiltaa aadi gunon ke kaaran adhiktar vartmaan vidwaan sur ko janmandh sweekaar nahin karte
 Shyamsundar Das has written in this regard - "sur was not actually born, because no one can make the same praise as that which he describes of beauty and color
 " doctor hajariprasad dvivedi ne likhaa he - "sursagar ke kuch padon se yah dhwani avashya nikalati he ki surdaas apane ko janm kaa andhaa or karm kaa abhaagaa kehete hai, par sab samay iske akshararth ko hi pradhan nahin maananaa chahie
 " surdaas ji dwaara likhit paanch granth bataae jate hai: The last two above are inaccessible
 nagari prachaarini sabha dwaara prakashit hastlikhit pustakon kii vivaran talika main surdaas ke 16 granthon kaa ullekh he
 These include Suryasagar, Sursaravali, Sahitya Lahiri, nal-damayanti, in addition to the wedding books, Dasamskandh Tika, Naglila, Bhagavat, Govardhan Leela, Surapchisi, Sursagar Saar, Pranpari, etc
 inamen prarambh ke teen granth hi mahatvapurn samajhe jate hai, sahitya lahari kii praapt prati main bahut prakshiptansh jude hue hai
 "sahitya Lahiri, Sursagar, Sur's Table
 shrikrishna ji kii bal-chhavi par lekhnee anupam chali
 
 " Sur has Krishna love and melody
 jisaki abhivyakti badi hi swaabhaavik or sajiv rup main hui he
 Thus we see that Surdas is a great poet of Hindi literature, because he not only equipped literature in terms of sentiment and language, but also gave birth to a specific tradition of Krishna-poetry
