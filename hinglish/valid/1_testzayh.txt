mumbai ke paas ke shahar hone ke kaaran or vishaal awasaiya ufaan kii vajah se, desh-videsh ke vibhinn rajyon ke shaharon se apravasiyon kii ek badi sankhya yahan dekhi ja sakati he
 The face of the city is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan nowadays
 marathi ke alaava, pakistan sahit vibhinn kshetron se uttar bhartiya, dakshin bhartiya, sindhi, gujarati or marwari or anya logon kii kaafii badi aabaadi mukhya rup se yahan he kyonki mumbai ke liye apni nikatataa ke kaaran log thane main apana pravaas bana rakhen hai
 Thane is surrounded by the Yeur hills on one side and is adorned with many beautiful lakes due to the cooler weather than Mumbai
 yahan ganesh chaturthi, diwaali, gudi padva, holi, durga puja, mahashivaratri or shivaji jayanti ke rup main samaaroh mahaan utsaah ke saath manaaya jaataa he
 During Gokulashtami festival in Thane, the winners of Dahi Handi game are given a high prize of Rs 1 lakh
 manoranjan kii drushti se thane shahar main kuch multiplex ke saath-saath do cinemagharon, arthath, gadakari rangaytan or hiranandani meadows ke paas sthit ek nae dow kashinath ghanekar sabhaagaar shaamil hai
 Both are owned and managed by the Thane Municipal Corporation
 iske alaava thane main multiplex / film theatre nimnlikhit he: Apart from the above there are a couple of multiplexes at Mulund near Thane
 udyaan tiemasi or van vibhaag kii ek sanyukt pahal par varsh-2011 main yahan ek vanaspati udyaan kaa udghaatan kiya gaya
 It is located in Kopri near Bara Bungalow area and is named after Shiv Sena leader Datta Ji Salvi
 yah bacchon ke manoranjan kii drushti se behad upayukta jagah he
 In addition, there are three complete clubs with swimming, gymnasium, sports and restaurant facilities such as the Swan Club at Ovala, Yours and the Blue Roof Club at United-21
 sanyukt 21 bhi thane main pehla he jo ek discothek he, jahaan bhojan or rahane kii suvidha ke liye, chaar sitara hotel, masaale or sos bhojanalay, oriental spice, blue lau, discothek he
 Many lakes here are crowded in the evening and people enjoy the nature
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, antarrashtriya simaaon yaa kshetron ke aar-paar puunji, maal or sevaaon kaa aadan-pradaan he
 
 In most countries, it represents a significant fraction of GDP
 jabaki antarrashtriya vyapaar, itihaas ke adhikansh bhaag main maujuud rahaa he iskaa aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik mahatv haal kii sadiyon main badhane laga he
 Industrialization, advanced transport, globalization, multinational corporations and outsourcing have all had a wide impact on the international trade system
 vaishvikaran kii nirantarata ke liye antarrashtriya vyapaar main badhotaree mahatvapurn he
 Without international trade, countries will be limited to goods and services produced within their own borders
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, siddhant rup main gharelu vyapaar se bhinn nahin he kyonki ek vyapaar main shaamil pakshon kii abhiprerana or vyavhaar moulik rup se badalata nahin he bhale hi vyapaar seemaa paar kaa ho yaa nahin
 The main difference is that international trade is generally more expensive than domestic trade
 iskaa kaaran he ki ek seemaa aam taur par atirikt shulk lagaati he jaise prashulk, seemaa par vilamb ke kaaran aavadhik laagat or bhashaa, kanoonee pranali yaa samskruti jaise deshiy bhinnataaon se judi laagtein
 Another difference between domestic and international trade is that production factors such as capital and labor are generally more dynamic within countries than outside
 is prakaar antarrashtriya vyapaar zyaadaatar maal or sevaaon ke vyapaar tak simit he or puunji, shram yaa utpaadan ke anya karkon ke vyapaar main keval ek chote paimaane par
 iske alaava maal or sevaaon kaa vyapaar, utpaadan karkon main vyapaar ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main kaary kar saktaa he
 Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of the factor of production and thus include the related factor
 An example is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China
 Rather than importing Chinese labor, the US is importing goods from China that are produced using Chinese labor
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, arthshaastra kii ek shakha bhi he, jo antarrashtriya vitt ke saath milakar antarrashtriya arthshaastra kii vistrut shakha kaa nirmaan karti he
 Several different models have been proposed to forecast the methodology of trade and to analyze the impact of trade policies such as tariffs
 ricardian model tulanaatmak laabh par kendrit he or antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main shaayad sabase mahatvapurn avadharana he
 In a Ricardian model, countries specialize in the production of the things they produce well
 anya modelon ke vipareet, ricardian dhaancha purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, maal kii ek vistrut shrunkhlaa kaa utpaadan karne ke bajaay visheshgy honge
 In addition, the Ricardian model does not directly consider factor funds, such as the relative amount of labor and capital within a country
 The major advantage of the Ricardin model is that it visualizes technology variations between countries
 praudyogiki antar, ricardian or ricardo-srapha model main aasaani se shaamil hota he 
 The Ricardian model makes the following assumptions: ricardian model laghu-avadhi main maapan karata he, isliye praudyogiki antarrashtriya str par bhinn hoti he
 This supports the fact that countries follow their comparative advantage and allow for specialization
 ricardian vyapaar model kaa adhyayan graham, jones, mekenzi or anya dwaara kiya gaya
 All principles excluded trade input goods such as intermediate goods, commodities and capital goods
 mekenji, jones or samuelson ne jor diya ki vyapaar se madhyavarti vastuon ko baahar rakhe jane se kaaphi laabh kho jayega
 ek prasiddh tippanee main mekenji ne kaha ki "ek pal kaa vichaar ek vyakti ko samajha degaa ki sooti kapade kaa utpaadan karne ke liye lankashair asambhavy hoga, yadi kapaas ko england main ugaana pade
 More recently, it expanded the theory to include the business intermediate case as well
 is prakaar "keval shram" dharna siddhant se nikaal di gai
 Thus the new Ricardian theory, sometimes named the ricardo-sraffa model, theoretically includes capital goods such as machines and materials, traded between countries
 vaishvik vyapaar ke samay main, yah dharna heksher-olin model kii apeksha adhik yathartwaadee he, jo yah maanata he ki puunji, desh ke andar sthir he or antarrashtriya str par gatisheel nahin he
 In the early 1900s, two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Olin, created an international trade theory called the factor ratio theory
 is siddhant ko heksher-olin siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The heckscher-olin theory emphasizes that countries should produce and export goods that require resources that are abundant and must import goods that require short-supply resources
 yah siddhant, tulanaatmak laabh or purna laabh ke siddhanton se bhinn he kyonki ye siddhant ek vishesh vastu ke liye utpaadan prakriya kii utpaadakta par kendrit hai
 In contrast, the heckscher-olin theory states that a country should specialize in production and export using factors that are most abundant and therefore cheap
 Do not produce those goods, as stated by earlier theories, which they produce most efficiently
 heksher-olin model ko buniyadi tulanaatmak laabh ke ricardian model ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Despite its greater complexity, it did not prove to be more accurate in its forecasts
 lekin ek saidhantik drushtikon se dekhne par yah antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main nav-shastreey mulya tantra ko shaamil karke ek suruchipurna samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 This theory argues that the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in factor funds
 yah purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, un maalon kaa niryaat karenge, jo sthaneey rup se prachur karkon kaa upyog karte hai or un maalon kaa aayaat karenge, jo aise karkon kaa upyog karte hai jo sthaneey rup se atyant alp hai
 Empirical problems with the HO model, known as the Leontief paradox, were encountered in empirical tests by Vasily Leontief, who found that the US was exporting labor-intensive goods despite the abundance of capital
 H-O model nimnlikhit mukhya dharanaen banaata he: The problem with HO theory is that it does not involve the trade of capital goods
 In HO theory, labor and capital are constant substances for each country
 ek aadhunik arthvyavastha main, puunjigat vastuon kaa antarrashtriya str par kaarobaar kiya jaataa he
 Trade in intermediate goods benefits greatly, as emphasized by Samuelson
 kai arthshaastri ricardo siddhant kii tulana main heksher-olin siddhant ko pasand karte hai, kyonki yah kam saral dharanaon ko banaata he
 In 1953, Vecily Leontief published a study where he tested the validity of the heckscher-olin theory
 The study showed that the US was more abundant in capital than other countries, so the US was exporting capital-intensive goods and importing labor-intensive goods
 Leontief found that US exports were less capital-intensive than imports
 leontiff virodhabhas ke ubharne ke baad, kai shodhakartaaon ne heksher-olin siddhant ko bachaane kii koshish kii, yaa to maapan ke nae tareekon dwaara, yaa nai vyakhyaaon ke dwaara
 limar ne bal diya ki leontiff ne H-O siddhant kii sahi vyakhya nahin kii or daawa kiya ki ek sahi vyakhya ke saath virodhabhas ghatit nahin hua
 Brecher and Choudary found that, if Leamer was right, the per capita consumption of American workers should be lower than the world average of workers' consumption
 baad main kai anya pareekshan hue lekin unamem se zyaadaatar asafal rahe
 Many well-known textbook authors, including Krugman and Obstfeld and Bowen, Hollander, and VN, are negative about the validity of the HO model
 
 anubhavjanya anusandhan ke lambey itihaas kaa pareekshan karne ke baad, boven, holender or vien ne nishkarsh diya: "kaarak bahutayat siddhant ke haal ke pareekshan jo sidhe HOV samikarnon kii jaanch karte hai, ve siddhant kii asweekruti kaa bhi sanket dete hai"
 :321 The Heckscher – Olin theory has not been well adapted to analyze south – north trade problems
 HO ke anumaan, N-N vyapaar kii tulana main N-S ke sambandh main kam yathartwaadee hai
 The income difference between North and South is the one thing the Third World cares the most
 kaarak mulya samakaran ne vasuuli kaa adhik sanket nahin dikhaaya he
 The HO model assumes that similar production functions between countries
 yah behad avastavik he
 Differentiation of technology between developed and developing countries is a major concern for poor countries
 is model main, udyogon ke bich shram gatishiltaa sambhav he, jabaki alpavadhi main udyogon ke bich puunji sthir he
 Thus, this model can be interpreted as a 'short-term' version of the Heckscher – Olin model
 vishisht kaarak naam, pradaan kiye jane vaale ke liye yah sandarbhit karata he ki alpavadhi main, bhautik puunji jaise utpaadan ke vishisht kaarak udyogon ke bich aasaani se antarneey nahin hai
 The theory suggests that if there is an increase in the price of the goods, then the owners of the factor of production in the specific context of that goods will have real good advantage
 iske alaava, virdohi utpaadan ke vishisht karkon ke maalikon ke paas virdohi kaarysoochee hone kii sambhaavna hoti jab ve shram ke apravas par niyantran ke liye paksh jutate hai
 In contrast, owners of both capital and labor benefit realistically from the increase in capital funds
 yah model vishesh udyogon ke liye adarsh he
 This model is ideal for understanding income distribution but is naïve to discuss the method of trade
 naveen vyapaar siddhant, vyapaar ke bare main kai tathyon ko samajhane kii koshish karata he, jo upar ullikhit do mukhya modelon ke liye mushkil he
 It also includes the fact that most trade occurs between countries with similar factor endowment and productivity levels and the large amount of multinational production that exists

 kai sadiyon tak vanikwaad main vishwaas ke tahat adhikansh deshon main antarrashtriya vyapaar par seemaa shulk ucch tha or kai pratibandh the
 In the 19th century, especially in the United Kingdom, trust in free trade became paramount
 uske baad se yah dharna pashchimi deshon ke bich prabhavi soch ban gai
 In the years following World War II, controversial multilateral treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization attempted to promote free trade by creating a globally regulated trade framework
 in vyapaar samjhauton ne, anuchit vyapaar ke daavon ke saath jo vikasshil deshon ke liye laabhadaayak nahin hai, aksar virodh or asantosh ko janm diya he
 Free trade is generally the most favored by the most economically strong countries, although they often engage in selective protectionism for industries that are strategically important, such as the US and Europe's imposition of agriculture
 a protective tariff
 The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were staunch advocates of free trade at the time when they were financially influential, today the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan being its biggest supporters
 haalanki, kai anya desh tezi se mukt vyapaar ke himachati banate ja rahe hai kyonki ve aarthik rup se khud adhik shaktishaalee ban rahe hai
 As the tariff level is declining, the desire to discuss non-tariff measures is also increasing, including foreign direct investment, recovery and trade facilitation
 Trade facilitation takes into account customs procedures and transaction costs related to carrying out trade

 During a recession, there is often excessive domestic pressure to increase tariffs to protect domestic industries
 mahaan mandi ke dauraan yah duniya bhar main hua
 Many economists have attempted to underline tariffs as an internal reason for the collapse in world trade, for which many believe it has exacerbated the recession

 Previous articles have discussed how international businesses need supporting ecosystems and business-friendly policies if they are to succeed in emerging markets
 vishesh mahatv tay he ki ve seoup unke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar kii anumati dene or unhen aage badhane or safal hone ke liye protsaahit karegaa main sarkaron kii bhoomika he
 Often, there is not an option for governments of many countries but they are also known as welcoming international businesses as they need "cash" or dollars
 udhaaharan ke liye, niryaat or aayaat ke bich ke antar ko chaalu khate ke ghate yaa siedi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Since many emerging markets, the deficit is the ones that need funding with the dollar
 phir, sarkaron ucch daron par in dollar udhaar lene yaa pratyaksh videshi nivesh yaa videshi pratyaksh nivesh or equity ke madhyam se ghaataa vitt exai yaa videshi sansthagat niveshkon se share bazaaron main bahati kar sakate hai
 In addition, domestic industry capabilities may not be a particular area nor the expertise to be successful in developing that field
 isliye, epadiai ki kshetra ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 In addition, the opening of the economy is necessary for entry into the World Trade Organization or World Trade Organization, which means that in order to export to other countries, to open in emerging markets and developing economies
 in vajahon se vikasshil deshon main kai sarkarein apane-apane deshon main seoup ke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar main videshi nivesh ko protsaahit karne or anumati dene ke kuch kar rahe hai
 However, a host of factors that do not continue the policies of the same governments include the ideological balance of governments, the compulsions of politics, and the fact that foreign investment may not succeed in kick-starting as a planned economy
 it depends on
 yahaan mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke kai sarkarein aksar kyonki uparokt kaarnon kaa khuli bahon se antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat he
 However, through the intervening process, some of them develop cold feet due to policy paralysis, and the factors listed above
 yah samajha ja saktaa he ki antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon main pravesh karne kii ijaajat di dwidaleey arth he ki vahaan sabhi hitdharakon se is mudde par vyapak sahmati hona chahie hona chahie kii jarurat he
 Only then will international business succeed in emerging market economies
 iske alaava, videshi puunji ke liye pratispardhaa he ki kisi main prakriya par pratikul arthvyavastha or isliye, is prakriya ko jari rakhaa janaa chahie or kaaran protsaahan diya antarrashtriya kaarobaar ko prabhavit karte hai itani teevr he
 Finally, examples from China, Brazil, South Africa, and Vietnam demonstrate the need for a consensus on the opening of economies and following through on this process
 duusari ore, bharat or rus ke udhaaharan ke anya tareeke se in deshon khuli bahon ke saath majaburiyon ke kaaran unki arthvyavasthaaon ko kholaa or phir lekin gati ko banaae rakhane ke rup main asafal aasapaas hai
 This means that integration in the global economy will only take place when the process of reforms is stopped wholeheartedly or without a U-turn

 aryabhat ne saura mandal ke ek bhukendriya model kaa varnan kiya he, jisame surya or chandramaa gruhachakra dwaara gati karte hai, jo ki parikrama karata he prithvi kii
 In this model, which is found in the Pitamahist theory, the motion of each of the planets is controlled by two planetary cycles, a small slow planetary cycle and a large early planetary cycle
 prithvi se duuri ke anusaar grahon kaa kram is prakaar he : chandramaa, budh, shukr, suraj, mangal, brihaspati, shani or nakshatra The position and duration of the planets were calculated as relative to points moving uniformly, in the case of Mercury and Venus, which revolve around the Earth at the same speed as the average Sun, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn In the case of, which move around the Earth in the zodiac at their specific speed

 Another element of Aryabhata's model, the Sighrocca, the period of the basic planets in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a mark of an underlying Sun-centered model
 grahaunhone kaha ki chandramaa or grah surya ke paravartit prakaash se chamakate hai
 Unlike the existing cosmology, in which the eclipses were the pseudo-planet Nispand point Rahu and Ketu, they described the eclipses as being cast by the earth and the shadow falling on it

 Later Indian astronomers improved these calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the major gist

 According to Aryabhata, the circumference of the Earth is 39,968
0582 kilometers, which is only 0
2% less than its actual value of 40,075
0167 kilometers

 If added to the modern English units of the periodic time of the constellations, the Earth's period of time according to Aryabhata) was 23 hours 56 minutes and 4
1 seconds; Modern time is 23: 56: 4

 The perception of the constellation of time was known in most other astronomical systems at that time, but this computation was probably the purest at that time

 Thus it is suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on the underlying Sun-centered model, in which planets orbit the Sun
 ek samiksha main is surya kendrit vyakhya kaa vistrut khandan he
 This review BL a book by Van der Varden describes "this book is unknown about Indian home doctrine and it directly contradicts every word of Aryabhata"
 Some people, however, accept that Aryabhata's system stems from an earlier Sun-centered model, which he did not know

 raja ko bhi sainikon kii sukh-suvidhaon kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie

 Spontaneous friend is better than artificial friend
 jis raja ke mitra lobhi, kaami tathaa kaayar hote hai, uskaa vinaash avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 In this way, Kautilya's Weekend Principle highlights the important role of all the organs while representing the invariable form of the state
 yadhyapi yah siddhant rajya kii aadhunik paribhaasha se mail nahin khaataa, kintu kautilya ke rajya main aadhunik rajya ke chaaron tatva vidyaman hai

 vah dharm kaa vyaakhyaata nahin, balki rakshak he
 Kautilya, considering the state as practicable in itself, has given it the highest position in social life
 rajya kaa hit sarvopari he jiske liye kai baar vah naitikta ke siddhanto ko bhi pare rakh detaa he
 According to Kautilya, the aim of the state is not just to establish peace and order, but to contribute to the supreme development of the person
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya ke kaary hai- Security related actions are to protect the state from enemies and invaders, protect the internal system of justice and protect the people from divine plagues - flood, earthquake, famine, fire, pestilence, deadly animals
 swadharm kaa paalan karanaswadharm ke antargat varnashram dharm par bal diya gaya he
 Although Kautilya does not subject the state to religion as Manu like religion, but the king preserves religion if the subjects are not followed by religion

 is prakaar kautilya kaa rajya sarvavyaapak rajya he
 Its goal is to establish public welfare and good administration, in which religion and morality are used as an instrument
 kautilya kaa kahana he, The king is happy in the happiness of the subjects
 praja ke liye jo kuch bhi laabhakaari he, usamen uskaa apana bhi laabh he
 "he has written at another place
 ‘‘bal hi satta he, adhikaar he
 Happiness is achieved through these means
 ’’is sambandh main salattore kaa kathan he, ‘‘jis rajya ke paas satta tathaa adhikaar he, uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy apni praja kii prasannataa main vruddhi karnaa he
 Thus Kautilya has appropriately directed the actions of a welfare state
 ’’ Diplomacy and Rajya Kautak Kautilya have discussed in detail not only the internal work of the state, but also the external works
 is sambandh main vah videsh niti, anterrashtriya sambandhon tathaa yuddh va shaanti ke niyamon kaa vivechan karata he
 In order to analyze the relationship of diplomacy, he has given the board theory- mandal siddhanthamukhya lekh : mandal kautilya ne apane mandal siddhant main vibhinn rajyon dwaara duusare rajyon ke prati apanaai niti kaa varnan kiya
 In ancient times, many small states existed in India
 shaktishaalee raja yuddh dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karte the
 States often compromised in other states in terms of security
 kautilya ke anusaar yuddh va vijay dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karne vaale raja ko apane shatruon kii apekshaakrit mitron kii sankhya badhaani chahie, taaki shatruon par niyantran rakhaa ja sake
 On the other hand, weak states should be vigilant against powerful neighboring states
 unhen samaan str vaale rajyon ke saath milakar shaktishaalee rajyon kii vistaar-niti se bachane hetu ek gut yaa ‘mandal’ bananaa chahie
 Kautilya's Mandal theory shows on the basis of geography how the neighboring countries of the state desiring victory can be its friends or enemies
 is siddhant ke anusaar mandal ke kendra main ek aisa raja hota he, jo anya rajyon ko jeetne kaa icchhuk he, ise ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ kaha jaataa he
 The first state to come in the path of "vijigishu" is "ari" and the state adjoining the enemy is "enemy of enemy", hence he is friend of Vijigishu
 kautilya ne ‘‘madhyam’’ va ‘‘udasin’’ rajyon kaa bhi varnan kiya he, jo samarthy hote hue bhi ranneeti main bhaag nahin lete
 This theory of Kautilya is based on realism, which emphasizes making the balance of power through treaties and agreements, considering wars as the reality of international relations
 chah sutreey videsh nitikautilya ne videsh sambandhon ke sanchaalan hetu chah prakaar kii nitiyon kaa vivaran diya he- The treaty may be made with an equivalent or more powerful king to maintain peace
 aatmaraksha kii drushti se shatru se bhi sandhi kii ja sakati he
 But its goal is to make the enemy weak over time
 vigrah yaa shatru ke viruddh yuddh kaa nirmaan
 Preparation for invasion without declaring war or war, policy of posture or neutrality, modification ie policy of the king to go to other king's shelter in terms of self-defense, duality, ie a policy of peace with one king by making peace
 kautilya ke anusaar raja dwaara in nitiyon kaa prayog rajya ke kalyaan kii drushti se hi kiya janaa chahie
 Four Principles of Diplomacy Practices Kautilya described the four principles of diplomacy in terms of foreign policy of the state, price, punishment and distinction
 kautilya ke anusaar pratham do siddhanton kaa prayog nirbal raajaaon dwaara tathaa antim do siddhanton kaa prayog sabal raajaaon dwaara kiya janaa chahie, kintu uskaa yah bhi mat he ki sam daam se, daam bhed se or bhed dand se shreyaskar he
 Punishment should be used as a last resort, because it also causes damage to oneself
 guptchar vyavasthakautilya ne guptcharon ke prakaaron va kaaryon kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he
 The undercover students could have been as homemakers, ascetics, businessmen and poisoners
 rajdoot bhi guptchar kii bhoomika nibhaate the
 Their task was to convey secret information of the country and abroad to the king
 ye janamat kii sthiti kaa aankalan karne, vidrohiyon par niyantran rakhane tathaa shatru rajya ko nasht karne main yogadan dete the
 Kautilya has suggested to keep the spies satisfied by giving them money and honor by the king
 chanakya or makiyavelih satya he ki kautilya ne raashtra kii raksha ke liye gupt pranidhiyon ke ek vishaal sanghathan kaa varnan kiya he
 For Shatruksha, there is a law for poisonous, miscellaneous, ceremonial use, abhinaya mantra etc
 unethical and inappropriate measures and for the purpose of this great money expenditure and loss of money have also been declared in accordance with the national policy
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main aisi charchaaon ko dekhakar hi mudrarakshaskaar kavi vishakhadutt chanakya ko kutilamati kaha he or banbhatta ne ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko ‘nirgun’ tathaa ‘atinrushanspryopadeshm’ kahkar nindit batalaaya he
 In a newly available historical work titled 'manjushree Moolakalp', Kautilya has been portrayed as 'durmati', Krodhan and 'papak', the character of Garha
 praachyavidya ke visheshgy anek aadhunik paashchaatya vidwaanon ne bhi uparyukt aniatik vyavasthaaon ko dekhakar kautilya kii tulana europe ke prasiddh lekhak or raajnneetijna mekiyavali se kii he, jisane apni pustak ‘da prince’ main raja ko lakshya-prapti ke liye uchit anuchit sabhi sadhano kaa aashray lene kaa upadesh diya he
 Western scholars, etc
 Western scholars demonstrate the following similarities between Kautilya and Mekiavali: mekiyavali or kautilya donon raashtra ko hi sab kuch samajhate hai
 They consider the nation as their own objective
 kautilya-niti kaa mukhya aadhaar he, ‘atmoday: parglani;’ arthath dusron kii haani par apana abhyuday karnaa
 Mekiavali has also favored the growth of his country at the loss of other countries
 donon ek samaan sweekaar karte hai ki is prayojan kii siddhi ke liye kitne bhi dhan tathaa jan ke vyay se shatru kaa vinaash avashya karnaa chahie
 It is not unreasonable to take shelter of any means, moral or immoral, for the achievement of its purpose
 mekiyavali or kautilya donon kaa mat he ki saadhy ko siddh karnaa hi raja kaa ekmaatr lakshya hona chahie
 He should not worry about the appropriateness or impropriety of the means
 donon yuddh ko raashtra-niti kaa aavashyak ang maanate hai
 In the opinion of both, each nation should be prepared for war, because by this the extent and influence of the country can be expanded
 apni praja main aatank sthapit karke dridhtaa tathaa nirdayata se us par shashan karnaa donon ek samaan pratipaadit karte hai
 Both support the establishment of a large well-organized intelligence department, which enters every aspect of the subjects to test their devotion to the king and seeks to destroy those who sympathize with the enemy by secret measures
 kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main aisi sadrushta dikhaanaa yuktisangat nahin
 Of course, Kautilya was also a realist like Mekiavali and was not merely a follower of idealism
 parantu yah kahana ki kautilya ne dharm yaa naitikta ko sarvatha tilanjali de di thi, satyata ke vipareet hoga
 Kautilya established itself in the first tribunal of 'arthashastra'; tasmaat swadharm bhootanaan raja na vyabhichaaryet
 Religion references, preity cheh na nandati That is, do not let the king subjects be disinherited from their religion
 raja bhi apane dharm kaa aacharan kare
 The king who conducts his religion in this way remains happy in this world and the hereafter
 isi pratham adhikaran main hi raja dwaara amaryaadaaon ko vyavasthit karne par bhi bal diya gaya he or varna tathaa ashram-vyavastha ko sudrudh karne ke liye aadesh diya gaya he
 Here the trilogy and the Vedic rituals have been told the basic basis of protection of the subjects
 kautilya ne sthaan-sthaan par raja ko vridhon kii sangat karne vaala, vidya se vinamr, jitendriya or kaam-krodh aadi shatru-shadvarg kaa daman karne vaala kaha he
 How can such a king persecute people by becoming irreligious or tyrannical? In contrast, the king has been called father-like for the subjects, who does the upbringing, enrichment, protection, maintenance, teaching, etc
 of his subjects as he does for his children
 yah thik he ki kautilya ne shatrunash ke liye aniatik upayon ke karne kaa bhi upadesh diya he
 But in this regard the following word of economics should not be forgotten: evam dooshyeshu adharmikeshu vartet, na itareshu
 That is, these diplomacy measures should be treated only with irreligious and wicked people, not with religious people

 Save money for the crisis period
 parivaar par sankat aae to dhan qurbaan kar den
 But we should also protect our family and money at stake
 chanakya niti ke dwitiya adhyay se kuch ansh -1
 jis prakaar sabhi parvaton par mani nahin milti, sabhi haathiyon ke mastak main moti utpann nahin hota, sabhi wanon main chandan kaa vriksh nahin hota, usee prakaar sajjan purush sabhi jagahon par nahin milte hai
 2
 Lying, rash, daring, deception, foolish act, greed, profanity and cruelty - these are the natural faults of women
 chanakya uparyukt dosha ko striyon kaa swaabhaavik gun maanate hai
 However, these defects cannot be rightly said in the educated women of the present era
 3
 bhojan ke liye achche padaarthon kaa uplabdh hona, unhen pachaane kii shakti kaa hona, sundar stri ke saath sansarg ke liye kaamashkti kaa hona, prachur dhan ke saath-saath dhan dene kii ichha hona
 Human beings get all these pleasures with great difficulty
 4
 chanakya kehete hai ki jis vyakti kaa putr uske niyantran main rahata he, jisaki patni ajna ke anusaar aacharan karti he or jo vyakti apane kamaaye dhan se puri tarah santusht rahata he
 For such a person, this world is like heaven
 5
 chanakya kaa maananaa he ki vahi gruhasthi sukhi he, jisaki santan unki ajna kaa paalan karti he
 It is also the duty of the father to take good care of his sons
 isi prakaar aise vyakti ko mitra nahin kaha ja saktaa he, jis par vishwaas nahin kiya ja sake or aisi patni vyarth he jisase kisi prakaar kaa sukh praapt na ho
 6
 It is good to abandon the friend who talks smooth in front of you and spoils your work behind your back
 chanakya kehete hai ki vah us barttan ke samaan he, jiske upar ke hisse main doodh laga he parantu andar vish bharaa hua hota he
 7
 Chanakya says that a person who is not a good friend should not believe in it, but at the same time one should not have full faith in the relation of a good friend, because if he gets angry, he can reveal all your differences
 at: saavdhaanee atyant aavashyak he
 8
 Chanakya believes that a person should never open his mind
 use jo bhi kaary karnaa he, use apane man main rakhe or puri tanmayata ke saath samay aane par use puraa karnaa chahie
 9
 Chanakya says that like foolishness, youth is also painful because in youth, one can do any foolish act in the impulse of sex
 parantu inase bhi adhik kshtdaayak he dusron par ashrith rahanaa
 10
 Chanakya says that as children are taught in childhood, they develop in the same way
 isliye mata-pita kaa kartavya he ki ve unhen aise maarg par chalaaen, jisase unamem uttam charitra kaa vikaas ho kyonki guni vyaktiyon se hi kul kii shobhaa badhati he
 11
 Those parents are like enemies to their children, who did not provide good education to the children
 kyonki anpadh balak kaa vidwaanon ke samooh main usee prakaar apmaan hota he jaise hanson ke jhund main bagule kii sthiti hoti he
 a person without education is like an animal without tail, so it is the duty of parents to give such education to children so that they can beautify the society
 12
 chanakya kehete hai ki adhik laad pyaar karne se bacchon main anek dosha utpann ho jate hai
 So if they do something wrong then it is not appropriate to ignore and be pampered
 bachche ko daantna bhi aavashyak he
 13
 Explaining the importance of education and study, Chanakya says that man is born very fortunate, so we should use more and more of our time in the study of Vedadi scriptures and good works like charity
 14
 jis prakaar patni ke viyog kaa dukh, apane bhai-bandhuon se praapt apmaan kaa dukh asahneeya hota he, usee prakaar karj se dabaa vyakti bhi har samay dukhi rahata he
 The servant who is in the service of the evil king also remains unhappy
 nirdhantaa kaa abhishaap bhi manushya kabhi nahin bhula paata
 With this, the soul of a person keeps on burning inside
 15
 chanakya ke anusaar nadi ke kinare sthit vrikshon kaa jivan anishchit hota he, kyonki nadiyaan baadh ke samay apane kinare ke pedo ko ujaad detii hai
 Similarly, a woman living in other homes can also go on the path of collapse at some time
 isi tarah jis raja ke paas acchhee salaah dene vaale mantri nahin hote, vah bhi bahut samay tak surakshit nahin rah saktaa
 There should be no doubt in this
 16
 chanakya kehete hai ki jis tarah veshya dhan ke samaapt hone par purush se munh mode leti he
 Similarly, when the king becomes powerless, the subjects leave him
 isi prakaar vrikshon par rahane vaale pakshi bhi tabhi tak kisi vriksh par baseraa rakhte hai, jab tak vahaan se unhen fal praapt hote rahete hai
 When the guest is fully welcomed, he also leaves the house
 17
 bure charitra vaale, akaaran dusron ko haani pahunchaane vaale tathaa ashuddh sthaan par rahane vaale vyakti ke saath jo purush mitrataa karata he, vah sheeghra hi nasht ho jaataa he
 Acharya Chanakya says that human beings should avoid bad company
 ve kehete hai ki manushya kii bhalaai isi main he ki vah jitani jaldi ho sake, dusht vyakti kaa saath chhod de
 18
 Chanakya says that it is better to do friendship only with people who are equal
 sarkari naukari sarvottam hoti he or achche vyapaar ke liye vyavahaarakushal hona aavashyak he
 In this way, the beautiful and beautiful woman adorns the house
 chanakya kii sikhchanakya ek jangal main jhopadi banaakar rahete the
 Many people used to come there to seek advice and knowledge from them
 jis jangal main vah rahete the, vah pattharon or contili jhaadiyon se bharaa tha
 Since it was often the practice of staying barefoot, people had to face many difficulties in reaching their residence
 vahaan pahunchate-pahunchate logon ke paanv lahooluhaan ho jate the
 One day some people reached Chanakya after facing a lot of difficulties from that route
 ek vyakti unase nivedan karte hue bolaa, ‘aapke paas pahunchane main ham logon ko bahut ksht hua
 You should ask Maharaj to arrange the land covered with leather
 isse logon ko aaraam hoga
 After listening to him, Chanakya said with a smile, "sir, laying the leather here will not solve the problem
" contile va patharile path to is vishwa main anginat hai
 In such a situation, it is impossible to lay leather all over the world
 haa, yadi aap log chamade dwaara apane pairon ko surakshit kar len to avashya hi patharile path va contili jhaadiyon ke prakope se batch sakate hai
 'that person bowed his head and said,' Yes guruji, i will do the same now
 ’ After this Chanakya said, 'look, there is a deep essence behind this thing of mine
 dusron ko sudhaarney ke bajaay khud ko sudhaaro
 With this you will definitely get victory in your work
 duniya ko naseehat dene vaala kuch nahin kar paata jabaki uskaa swayan paalan karne vaala kamyaabi kii bulandiyon tak pahunch jaataa he
 ' Everyone was agreeable to this chanakya kii kutiyapatliputra ke amaatya acharya chanakya bahut vidwaan nyaaypriy hone ke saath ek sidhe sade eemaandaar sajjan vyakti bhi the
 He used to live in a thatch-covered hut despite being the General Secretary of such a vast empire

 Once the Ambassador of Greece reached the Raj Durbar to meet him, the Ambassador was enchanted after listening to the discussion of Daksha Chanakya in politics and diplomacy
 rajdoot ne shaam ko chanakya se milane kaa samay maanga
 Acharya said - You can come to my house at night
 rajdoot chanakya ke vyavhaar se prasann hua
 In the evening when he started asking about 'amatya Niwas' in the Rajmahal complex
 raaj prahari ne bataaya- acharya chanakya to nagar ke baahar rahete hai
 The Ambassador thought that perhaps the General Minister would have a beautiful palace built on the lake outside the city
 rajdoot nagar ke baahar pahuncha
 Asked a citizen where to live Chanakya
 ek kutiyaa kii ore ishaara karte hue naagarik ne kaha-dekhie, vah saamne mahaamantri kii kutiyaa he
 The ambassador was surprised
 usne kutiyaa main pahunchakar chanakya ke paanv chhue or shikaayat kii-aap jaisaa chatur mahaamantri ek kutiyaa main rahata he
 Chanakya said - If i stay in the palaces made by hard earned money and sweat of the public, then the citizen of my country will not have any luck
 chanakya kii eemaandaaree par yunaan kaa rajdoot natmastak ho gaya

 Those who are familiar with its creative role still have the same dedicated attitude towards it
 yah sweekaarya karne main hamen katai sankoch nahin he kii vigat kuch varsho main kinhi visham parishathitiyo ke kaaran isaki sakriyata pe viraam aa gaya
 Some of the main columns also collapsed due to this

 Now we are responsible for its operation and development

 According to Vedic scholar Shri Munshiram Sharma Som, serving this dynasty is as if to bring a series of ideals to the fore
 jo haath is punya kaary main jute hai ve bhuri- bhuri sadhuwaad env aashirwad ke paatr hai
 The detailed description of the ethnic Yodhyas of Shri Bhatt Brahmin Neyuvak Sangh - Mumbai is as follows
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj vastu sangrahalay mumbai, mumbai kaa mukhya sangrahalay he

 iske peeche ek mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki bhakpa kii raajnneeti main bhartiya paristhitiyon ko kam ahmiyat di jaati thi
 On most occasions, communist international or Soviet Union directives worked to determine the party's strategy

 unhone is baat par jor diya ki satta kaa hastantaran vaastavik he or nehru kii sarkaar se yah spasht sanket miltaa he ki vah samrajyavad-virdohi takaton kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 He therefore urged that the CPI should reevaluate its views about the Congress

 Its labor organization All India Trade Union Congress was well established among the workers

 This caused a lot of resentment towards Nehru within a section of the CPI
 lekin is samay bhakpa ke kaaryakarta bhram kii sthiti main the, kyonki nehru sarkaar kaa soviet union ke saath kaafii acha sambandh tha
 The Soviet party expected the CPI to adopt a soft attitude towards the Nehru government

 By the sixties, relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China began to deteriorate
 china kii communist party ne soviet union kii communist party par aarope lagaaya ki vah sanshodhanavaadee ho kar marxvad-leninavaad ke raste se bhatak chuki he
 Here, relations between China and India also worsened
 seemaa vivaad ke kaaran 1962 main bharat-china ke bich yudgh bhi hua
 a faction of the CPI supported the policy of the Government of India
 vahiin party ke ek duusare dhade ne yah daawa kiya ki yah samaajawaadee or poonjeewaadi rajya ke bich takaraav he
 In fact, the tactics of these factions of the CPI also played an important role in the international trend among communists
 bhakpa ke soviet samarthak dhade ne us samay kii sattadhari party bhartiya rashtriya congress ke saath sahyog karne ke vichaar ko aage badhaayaa
 But another faction of the CPI, which later became the CPI, called it the revisionist idea of 'class-cooperation'
 gauratlab he ki bharat ke tisare aam chunaavon main bhakpa ko 29 siton par jeet mili
 The CPI was still the second largest party in Parliament after the Congress
 lekin party ke ek kheme ke bheetar yah vishwaas prabal ho gaya tha ki asal main nehru sarkaar ke prati zyaada sakht ravaiya na rakhane kaaran hi bhakpa kaa prasar nahin ho rahaa he
 After a time, this conflict increased significantly
 1964 main bhakpa kaa vibhaajan ho gaya or ek nayi party makapa kaa ubhaar hua
 Many militant leaders of the CPI like Namboodiripad, Jyoti Basu, Harkishan Singh Surjeet etc
 joined the CPI (M)
 isse pashchim bengal jaise rajyon main bhakpa ke aadhaar par nakaaratmak prabhaav padaa
 The CPI also had a significant impact for the first few decades of the party's split in Kerala
 1970-77 ke bich bhakpa ne congress se gathjod kiya or uske saath milakar sarkaar bhi banaayi jisamen bhakpa ke si
 achyut menon rajya ke mukhyamantri bane 
 Subsequently, the CPI did not get a chance to come to power in any state
 1970-77 ke daur main congress se gathjod hone ke kaaran bhakpa ne indira gandhi kii congress dwaara lagaaye gayi apatkaal kaa samarthan kiya
 But by the decade of the eighties, the CPI (M) became a stronger Communist Party
 desh ke duusare kai bhaagon main bhakpa kii acchhee upasthiti rahi, lekin kuch kshetron main zyaada majboot upasthiti ke kaaran makapa aage nikal gayi
 After 1977, the CPI formed the Left Front in association with the CPI (M) and other minor communist parties
 vyaavhaarik taur par kerala sahit adhikansh jagahon par yah party makapa ke ek chote sahyogi dal main badal gayi
 On most occasions, its performance depended on the performance of the Left Front
 nabbe ke baad ke daur main bhakpa ne secular or gair-bhaajapa, gair-congress dalon kii raajnneeti ko majbooti dene par kaafii dhyaan diya he
 It opposed the neo-liberal policies of the Congress in association with the CPI-M led Left Front

 Thus, despite being part of the Left Front, it displayed its political autonomy

 The reason for this was the decline in the performance of the Left Front in West Bengal
 khaastaur par singoor or nandigram jaisi jagahon main rajya sarkaar dwaara jabardastee bhoomi adhigrahan kii koshish or uske virodh kaa bal-prayog dwaara daman karne jaisi ghatnaon ne vam morche kii chhavi kaafii karaab kii
 It also had an impact on the cpi's electoral performance and it won only 4 seats in Lok Sabha compared to 10 in 2004
 bhakpa kii raajnneeti kii kai seemayen ab spasht ho chuki hai : pehla, bhakpa ne vam morche kii raajnneeti main khud kaa is tarah samahit kar liya he ki kai gambheer masalon par bhi isane ek seemaa se zyaada makapa kaa virodh nahin kiya he
 It has shown its autonomy only on a few occasions, but on most issues its strategy is part of the strategy of the Left Front
 doosraa, yadhyapi makapa desh ke teen rajyon main kaafii majboot sthiti main he, lekin bhakpa kaa vistaar desh ke duusare bhaagon main zyaada rahaa he
 For example, CPI also has a strong presence in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu
 lekin bihar jaise rajyon main isane apana aadhaar kaafii had tak kho diya he, kyonki ab pahchaan kii raajnneeti ke saamne vah apni praasangikta sabit karne main naakaam rahi he
 Third, the CPI has failed to expand into new areas like other parliamentary left parties
 yah ek tarah se thahari hui party ban gayi he
 It has either managed to save its base in some places, or is also losing that base
 naye kshetron main bhakpa kaa prasar nahin ho rahaa he
 It won only less than 15 seats in every election of Lok Sabha after 1980
 masalan, 1980 ke sansadeey chunaavon main 11, 1984 main 6, 1989 main 12, 1991 main 14, 1996 main 12, 1998 main 9, 1999 main 4, 2004 main 10 or 2009 main 4 siton par jeet hasil hui
 Fourth, it is also alleged that the CPI has withdrawn from the politics of struggle at the ground level
 yadhyapi is aalochana ko puri tarah se sahi nahin mana ja saktaa, kyonki jin kshetron main bhakpa kaa astitv he, vahaan usne rajya daman ke kilaaf kaafii sangharsh kiya he
 For example, the CPI in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh strongly opposed the state-sponsored Salwa Judum Campaign
 paanchavaan, bhakpa kii raajnneeti kii aalochana kaa ek aadhaar yah bhi rahaa he ki isane poonjeewaadi rajya kii loktantric vyavastha ko puri tarah sweekaar kar liya he
 Now it is working within the nationalist framework and the strategy of overthrowing the capitalist state is not part of its politics
 baharhaal, in aalochanaon ke baavjood is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki bhartiya raajnneeti main bhakpa ke paas ek lambi viraasat he
 Most of the currents of Indian communist politics originated from this party
 isane sansadeey raajnneeti main vampanthi dalon ke bich ekajutata kaayam karne ke bhi gambheer prayaas kiye hai
 It has been trying to strengthen the non-congress, non-bjp politics in India and promote the interests of the common people
 bhrashtachar jaise aaropon se bhakpa har str par puri tarah se mukt rahi he
 In fact, the main challenge of the CPI is that it, despite being part of the Left Front, avoid being a 'photo copy' or small ally of the CPI (M) and maintain its autonomous politics
 iske alaava, desh ke vibhinn bhaagon apana prasar karnaa bhi bhakpa ke liye ek badi chunauti he

 Some geographers divide the indo-gangetic Plain into several parts: the Indus Valley, the plains of Punjab, the plains of Haryana, and the middle and lowlands of the Ganges
 These regional differences are mainly based on the availability of water

 punjab evam haryana ke maidani ilaakon kii sinchai raavi, beas or sutluj nadiyon dwaara kii jaati he
 Due to the progress made in irrigation projects on these rivers, the flow of water has reduced, which reaches the lower valley areas of the Indian state of Punjab and the Indus Valley in Pakistan

 Many species of wild boar, deer and sambhar were found in the forest areas
 ganga ke kareeb daldali kshetron main dariyaan ghodon kii vilupt prajatiyon ke saath bhainson ke vishaal samooh charate hue nazar aate the
 Therefore, such a large number of animals must have attracted a large number of carnivorous animals as well
 Wolves, jackals, striped laggards, Indian cheetahs and Asiatic lions may have hunted heavily on the open plains while tigers and leopards may have hunted in the surrounding forests
 The Ganges was home to a large number of gharial, crocodiles and dolphins found in the river, which controlled the number of fishes and occasional herds crossing the river

 Various kingdoms rose and expanded in the flat and fertile region, including the Gupta Empire, Kannauj, Magadha, Mauryan Empire, Mughal Empire and Delhi Sultanate - the demographic and political centers of all these kingdoms were located in the indus-gangetic plains

 Initially, the lander was expected to be developed by Russia in cooperation with India
 jab rus ne 2015 se pehle lander ke vikaas main apni asamarthta jataai
 So the Indian authorities decided to develop the lander independently
 rus lander ko radd karne kaa matlab tha
 That the mission profile will change

 The initial plan was to have the rover designed in Russia and manufactured in India
 haalanki, rus ne may 2010 ko rover ko dizin karne se manaa kar diya
 Subsequently, ISRO decided to design and manufacture the rover itself
