 Arya Samaj scholars do not believe so
 unka vishwaas he ki dev shabd vaidic vaanmay main vidwaanon or tapasviyon, saamanyat: poojya janon, ke liye vyavahrut hua he
 It may be so, but it is not so according to the beliefs of ordinary Hindus
 dev shabd ko saamne upasthit vidwaanon kaa vaachak maanane par kai mantron kaa arth nahin lagata, jaise : The Gods worshiped Yajnapurusha through Yajna, by those religions which are the governing religions of this world

 Devas, Devas, opposers of the Goddess are called by names like Asura, Monster, Demon
 sanskrit main dev or devtaa samanarthak nahin hai
 The first thing that attracts attention is that the word deity is feminine and second that it is used only in relation to mantras
 yadi kisi sanskrit pustak main devtaa ko dev ke arth main likh diya gaya he to ise meri samaj main lekhak kaa pramaad jaananaa chahie, yadhyapi kai koshkar donon shabdon ko samanarthak bhi maanate hai
 This is also used in many reputed books, but all these have been composed since the Vedas
 prayek vedamantra ke saath uske drashtaa rishi tathaa chand or uske viniyog kaa ullekh hota he or saath hi ek devtaa kaa naam bhi liya jaataa he
 The name of the deity is usually in Pulling, such as: vishnu chale, unhone teen baar paanv rakhe, sara vishwa unke paanv kii dhuli se bhar gaya
 The deity is mentioned with this mantra
 parantu devtaa shabd ke streeling hone se yon kahana haaga ki 'is mantra kii devtaa vishnu he
 Similarly, the god of any mantra, Indra, someone's Rudra etc
 yah vilakshan baat prathit haati he
 This tradition has followed in the scriptures

 a mantra is of a letter, a number of letters, such as Sri or Klein, Un vajrayaya Swaha or Anri Klein Chamundayai Vichhe Swaha
 prayek mantra ke saath uski devtaa kaa ullekh he
 It is worth considering why the word feminine deity is used for the male deity with the mantra

 yadi aisa kaha jaataa he ki amuk mantra kii devtaa rudra he to taatpary yah he ki us mantra ke vidhipurvak jap se sadhak main rodri shakti- sanhaarak shakti kaa udai, udbodh hoga

 jisane jis shakti kaa vishesh udbodh kiya he usko uske naam se pukaara jaataa he
 These people keep using their personalities for the welfare of other organisms for a long time

 It can be said that a person with deity is a god
 prasangvshaat yah bhi vichaar kar lenaa chahie ki arthvikriya hui kyon or dev shabd kaa chalan kyon kam ho gaya
 As long as the Vedic Yajna was performed, the study of Veda was also taught
 baudhdhakaal ke baad yagyon kaa chalan bahut kam ho gaya, vedapth nishprayojan sa prathit hone laga
 As a result, attention was diverted from the meaning of the mantras, the goal of the word deity disappeared
 devataaon ke pratik ke rup main indradi naam pehle se hi die hue the
 The attention was also removed from the femininity of the word deity
 pratik mul ban gaya

 The result of religious bitterness even reached some important words related to religion
 inamen se do shabd dev or asur the
 The word deva derives from the divine metal, which means to shine
 jo prakaashman, tejasvi, ho vah dev he
 The derivation of Asura according to Sayan is as follows: Asyati Kshipati Sarvan - One who throws everyone away
 iskaa arth unhone prabel: prabal, bataaya he
 Initially, both of these words had the same meaning
 devgan tejasvi bhi the or prabal bhi, at: vah asur bhi the
 The memories of this ancient experiment are safe in the Veda itself
 kai jagahon main devon ko asur kaha gaya he
 There are 22 mantras in the 55th Sukta of the third mandala of the Rigveda
 sabamein devon ke asuratv kii charchaa he
 At the end of each mantra it is said: The insecurity of the gods is great, that is, they are very strong
 udhaaharan ke liye sukt kaa 10waan mantra lijie : - The protector Vishnu goes through the ultimate path, holding the beloved Amrit Dham
 agni un sab dhaamon ko jaanate hai, God has a great insecurity
 
 Both of these words got divided in religious rhetoric
 irani aaryon ne asur shabd ko apanaaya or bharatiyon ne dev shabd ko
 In Iran, God was called Ahuramazd - Asura maht - big asura - then in India he got the title of Mahadev
 falat: irani samudaay main dev nindaaspad ban gaya or bharatiyon main yahi durgati asur shabd kii hui
 Even after people became Muslims, the word Dev could not rise up in the Iranian language, Persian, the same ghost was used in the sense of evil, evil and evil but powerful

 Now there was an old Dev word here, the second this new Dev word arrived

 The stories of Kaladev, Laldev etc
 became popular in the world, such a man has a body like a god, such sentences started being heard

 Many of these are seen in the hundred-year-old drama Amanatakrit Inder Sabha
 vahaan raja inder ke darbar main apsaraon kii jagah pariyaan or agni, varun, vishnu aadi kii jagah bhanti bhanti ke rangeen dev hi manch par aate hai
 The word 'sur' is also discussed above
 iskaa itihaas bhi rochak prathit hota he
 It was not revealed in Vedic poetry
 aisa prathit hota he ki peeche se asur shabd kii vyutpatti bhuulakar logon ne aisa sochaa hoga ki a or sur milane se yah shabd bana he
 In such a situation, it will mean no sound
 jo sur na ho vah asur hua
 Asuras were the antagonists of the Devas, so Sur ease became synonymous with Dev

 raknuddin, kaa shashan bahut hi kam samay ke liye tha, iltutamish kii vidhwaa, shah turkan kaa shashan par niyantran nahin rah gaya tha
 The public outraged against the lax and reckless Raknuddin to the extent that Raknuddin and his mother, Shah Turkan, were assassinated on 9 November 1236

 After this, in the absence of any other option for the Sultan, the Muslims had to give the reins of governance to a woman
 
 And Razia Sultan became the ruler of Delhi
 shashan kaaryon main razia kii ruchi apane pita ke shashan ke samay se hi thi
 After assuming the throne, Razia preferred to wear a soldier's coat and turban like men, unlike customs
 balki, baad main yuddh main bina nakaab pahane shaamil hui
 Razia renounced the purdah system and started wearing open clothes in the court like men wearing a cog razia apni raajnneetik samajhadaari or nitiyon se sena tathaa jansadharan kaa dhyaan rakhti thi
 She became the most powerful ruler of Delhi
 razia or uske salaahkaar, jamaat-ud-din-yakut, ek habshi ke saath viksit ho rahe antarang sambandh kii baat bhi musalamaanon ko pasand nahin ai
 Razia did not pay enough attention to it
 , kintu uskaa is sambandh ke parinaam ko kam aankna apane rajya ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 According to some sources, Razia and Yakut were lovers; According to other sources, they were both close friends / confidants
 is sabase razia ne turki varg main apane prati ishya ko janm de diya tha, kyonki, yakub, turk nahin tha or use razia ne ashwashaala kaa adhikari niyukt kar diya tha
 The Governor of Bathinda, Mallik ikhtiar-ud-din-altunia, revolted along with the other provincial governors, who were ruled by the ruler of Razia
 razia or altuniya ke bich yuddh hua jisamen yakut maaraa gaya or razia ko bandi bana liya gaya
 Fearing death, Razia agreed to marry Altunia
 is bich, razia ke bhai, mazuddin beharam shah, ne singhaasana hathiyaa liya
 Razia and her husband, Altunia, fought Behram Shah to defeat her Sultanate, in which she was defeated
 unhen dilli chhodkar bhaagna padaa or agle din wo kaithal panhuche, jahaan unki sena ne saath chhod diya
 On 14 October 1240, both were killed in a clash with the Jats there
 baad main beharam ko bhi ayogyata ke kaaran gaddi se hatana padaa
 The tomb of Razia Sultan and her lover Yakut, the only female ruler to rule the throne of Delhi, is claimed at three different places
 razia kii majaar ko lekar itihaaskaar ek mat nahin he
 Delhi, Kaithal and Tonk have been claiming their claim on the tomb of Razia Sultana
 lekin vaastavik majaar par abhi faisla nahin ho paaya he
 By the way, these three claims are the strongest among the claims of Razia's tomb
 in sabhi sthanon par sthit majaaron par arabi farsi main razia sultan likhe hone ke sanket to mili hai lekin thos pramaan nahin mil sake hai
 Some concrete evidence of the tomb of Razia Sultan and his Ethiopian slave Yakut has been found in Tonk, Rajasthan
 yahaan puraane kabistan ke paas ek vishaal majaar mili he jisapar farsi main ’saltane hind rajiyah’ ukera gaya he
 There is also a small tomb nearby which can be Yakut's tomb
 apni bhavyata or vishalata ke aakaar par ise sultanaa kii majaar qaraar diya gaya he
 Local historian says that there was a gap of one month between Jung and Razia's death from Bahram
 itihaaskaar is ek maah ko chook vash ullekith nahin kar paae or jang ke turant baad uski maut maan lee gai
 Whereas it was not so
 jang main haar ko saamne dekh yakuut razia ko lekar raajapootaana kii taraf nikal gaya
 He wanted to save Razia's life but eventually he was surrounded in Tonk and died here

 The initial plan was to have the rover designed in Russia and manufactured in India
 haalanki, rus ne may 2010 ko rover ko dizin karne se manaa kar diya
 Subsequently, ISRO decided to design and manufacture the rover itself

 Istikbal Khan is a politician in the National Assembly of Pakistan
 He represents the NA-28 constituency for the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan
 mimasaasutra, bhartiya darshan ke sabase mahatvapurn granthon main se ek he
 Its author is Maharishi Jaimini
 ise purvamimasaasutra bhi kehete hai
 Its creation is believed to be from 300 BCE to 200 BCE
 mimasaasutra, mimasaa darshan kaa aadharbhoot granth he
 According to the tradition, sage Jaimini is considered a disciple of Maharishi Veda Vyasa
 mimasaasutra kaa 'purvamimasaa' tathaa veydant kaa 'uttarmimasaa' bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Purmimamsa, there is the idea of religion and in Uttara Mimamsa there is the idea of brahma
 atah purvamimasaa kaa dharmamimasaa ar uttar mimasaa kaa brahmamimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Mimamsa is called 'jaiminiya Dharmamimamsa' from the sutra hahene composed by Jaimini Muni
 purvamimasaa main veda ke yajnparak vachanon kii vyakhya bade vichaar ke saath kii gayi he
 There is a detailed discussion of Yajna in Mimamsa Shastra, this is also called 'yajnavidya'
 baarah adhyyon main vibhakt hone ke kaaran yah mimasaa 'dwadashalakshani' bhi kehalaati he
 The name of this scripture is not named 'purvimamsa' with the intention that it was made before Uttermimansa
 'purv' kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki karmkand manushya kaa pratham dharm he, gyankand kaa adhikaar uske uparant aata he 
 The word 'mimansa' means 'curiosity'
 jigyaasa, arthath jaanane kii laalasaa
 When a man incarnated in this world, his first curiosity was what should he do? Maharish Jaimini starts this book in this way- atev is darshanashastra kaa pratham sutara manushya kii is ichha kaa pratik he
 The six means of achievement of knowledge in this book are discussed - direct, conjecture, subhuman, word, economy and unavailability
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar veda aporushey, nity evam sarvopari he or veda-pratipaadit arth ko hi dharm kaha gaya he
 Its second sutra states- mimasaa kaa tatvasiddhanth vilakshan he 
 It is counted in atheistic philosophies
 aatma, brahm, jagat aadi kaa vivechan isamen nahin he
 It only represents the continuity of the Veda or its word
 iske anusaar mantra hi sab kuch hai
 He is the deity; Gods have no separate power
 'bhattadipika' main spasht kaha he 'shabd maatram devtaa' 
 The argument of the believers is that all are for the purpose of the results
 fal kii prapti karm dwaara hi hoti hai atah ve kehete hai ki karm or uske pratipadak vachanon ke atirikt upar se or kisi devtaa yaa ishwar ko maanane kii kya aavashyaktaa he
 The great distinction between the Mimansakas and the Naiyayikas is that Mimansak considers the word eternal and eternal impermanence
 sankhya or mimasaa donon anishvaravaadi hai, par veda kii pramanikta donon maanate hai 
 The difference is so much that Sankhya considers the new revelation of Veda in every kalpa and Mimansak calls it non-destructive even in Kalpanta
 mimasaa darshan 16 adhyyon kaa he, jisamen 12 adhyay krambaddh hai
 Shastra Sangathi is associated with Adhyatagati, Padasangati and Adhyakanti
 in baarah adhyyon main jo chhot gaya he, uskaa nirupan shesh chaar adhyyon main kiya gaya he jo 'sankarshkand' ke naam se prasiddh he
 The authority of the deity has been discussed in it, hence it is also called the 'deity Case' or it can also be called an appendix of two chapters
 bhaskar raay dikshit ne sankarshan kand kii vyakhya ke ant main likhaa he ki shodashadhai mimasaa ke rahete hue bhi madhya kaal main dwadashadhyay kaa hi pathnpathan hota tha
 Dharmapramanas have been represented in the philosophy of this philosophy and method, economism mantra, memory, etiquette, nomadism, ambiguous sentences and decisive power
 dwitiyadhyaay main shabdaantar, abhyaas, sankhya, sangya, gun or prakarnaantar, ye chah karm bhed ke pramaan hai
 Shruti, gender, sentence, episode, place and Samakhya are the six evaluative evidences in Tritiyadhyaya
 chaturthadhyay main, shruti arth, paath, sthaan, mukhya or pravriti main chah bodhak pramaan hai
 There are seven types of excesses in Panchmadhyaya, directive, directive, nominal order, hypothetical order, dependency order and place-of-order
 ant ke do bhed saptavadhyay main varnit nahin hai
 These are denoted in the sense of authority and placements mandate
 chathe adhyay main yagyon ke karne or karaanevaalon ke adhikaar kaa nirnay he
 The seventh and eighth describes the method of performing a yajna in another yajna
 aathven adhyay main ek yajna kii vidhi ko duusare yajna main karne kaa varnan he
 The ninth chapter represents three types of "ooh"
 dashamadhyay main teen prakaar ke 'baadh' kaa nirupan he
 Ekadasadhyaya has the representation of Tantra and Aavya
 dwadashadhyay main "prasang" kaa nirupan he
 Thus each and every subject has been rendered in philosophical epistemology philosophy which has also been called "dvadashlakshi"
 yahan 'lakshan' shabd adhyaywachak he
 It has been divided in two ways, which is called preaching and overtaking
 pratham adhyyon main upadesh kaa vivechan he
 The six chapters of the second describe the overarching narrative
 ukt upadesh atidesh dway vichaaratmak shaastra he
 According to Shastra Deepikaar Parthasarathi Mishra, the beginning of the idea of precept is different from the precept
 vartmaan kaal main uplabdh mimasaa darshan main dwadash adhyay hai
 Each chapter has four legs, but the third, shashtha and tenth chapters have eight pahadas, also known as "shabara" chapters
 is tarah sampurna granth main saath paad hai
 There is controversy in the thread of this philosophy
 kisi ke mat main do sahasr chah sau baawan, kisi ke mat main do sahasr saat sau bayalis sutara hai
 The above description is propounded in the book page four of "aasikit" called "karmamimansa"
 anand ashram puna se prakashit "nyaayamala" main do sahasr saat sau pantalis sutron kaa pratipaadan he
 Similarly, the tribunal number of some persons is nine hundred and seven
 kuch ke mat se nau sau pandrah sutara hai
 But according to Shankar Bhatt, the doer of the "mimamsaar collection", there are five hundred thirty in "purushtak", four hundred and seventy sutras in Uttarashtak
 is prakaar sampurna adhikaran ek sahasr sankhya main vibhajit he
 According to the above verses, the number of tribunals is one thousand two hundred and fifty
 mimasaa main prayek adhikaran ke paanch bhaag hai— vishay, sanshay, purvapaksh, uttarapaksh or siddhanth 
 Therefore, to understand the Sutras, it is necessary to know which of the five sources is the proponent of which
 is shaastra main vaakya, prakaran, prasang yaa granth kaa taatpary nikaalane liye bahut sookshm niyam or yuktiyaan di gai hai
 This shloka of Mimansakas is generally famous for meaning- arthath kisi granth yaa prakaran ke taatparynirnay ke liye saat baton par dhyaan dena chahie—upkram, upsanhaar, abhyaas, apurvata, fal, arthwaad, or upapatti 
 Mimansak implies Vedas by such rules
 shabdaarthon kaa nirnay bhi vichaarpurvak kiya gaya he 
 For example, for 'yajna' where 'sahasra Samvatsar' is there, 'samvatsar' should be taken as the day, etc
 mimasashastra karmkand kaa pratipadak he; atah mimasak paurushey, apaurushey sabhi vaakyon ko kaaryparak maanate hai
 They say that every sentence is indicative of a business or a deed, which results in something
 atah ve kisi baat ke sambandh main yah nirnay karnaa bahut aavashyak maanate hai ki vah 'vidhi-vaakya' he athwa keval arthwaad 
 Like, "go to the battlefield, there is heaven"
 is vaakya ke do khand hai — 'rankshetra main jaao' yah to vidhivaakya yaa mukhya kathan he, or 'vahaan swarg rakhaa he' yah keval arthwaad yaa gaun baat he
 Its sources are of Jaimini and the commentary is of Shabar Swami
 mimasaasutra par kumaril bhatta ke 'kaatantravaarthik' or 'shlokavarthik' bhi prasiddh hai 
 Madhwacharya has also composed a commentary called 'jaiminiya Nyayamala Vistar'

 The earliest forms of this type of trance are referred to as classic trance and were longer and more esoteric than trance in line with the dance of the future
 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak ke trns vishesh rup se progressive trns the, jo adhikanshtah trns acid se prakat hue, jaise ki acid house se progressive house ubhare, jiskaa nrity sangeet ke rup main ek prabhaavshaalee style ke taur par vyavsaayik vikaas hua
 Progressive trance has made an indelible mark on the basic formula of modern trance, moving away from the compelling, recurring, elaborate analog synth patterns and spacey pads, focusing on the popular baseline and lead melody
 lokapriy tatv or anthmik pad or adhik vyapak ho gaye
 There was an incremental change in the composition of the songs, sometimes composed in thirds
 Meanwhile, a different type of trance, commonly called uplifting trance, was becoming popular
 utthit trns main jo utaar-chadhaav the ve adhik lambey or adhik atiranjit the, progressive kii tulana main adhik pratyaksh or kam sookshm hone ke kaaran, adhik aasaani se pahachaane jane vaali dhunon or sabake honton par basane vaale ban gaye
 Many such trance tracks follow a set form, with introductions, static mounting, descending and later anthem, a format accurately referred to as "build-breakdown-anthem"
 utthit swar, saamanytah mahila ke, adhik prachlit hone lage, jisase trns kii lokapriy aakarshan main izaafaa hua
 The highly popular trance found itself gaining more 'incisive' space than House, which was more enjoyable than drums and bass and more melodic than techno, allowing it to reach a wider audience
 paul vine dick, armin vine buren, tiesto, robert miles, ebove and biond, derren tet, pheri corseten, johaan jielen, ATB, paul okenfold, pulsar or third element jaise kalakaar agrani nirmaataa, remixkarta ke rup main saamne aae or apane saath bhaavnaatmak "mahakavy" style ke anubhav ko prastut kiya

 1990 dashak ke ant tak vyavsaayik taur par trns kaaphi vishaal ho chukaa tha, lekin yah ek atyant alag style main khandit tha
 In the early and mid-1990s, some artists who had helped create the trance sound had by the end of the decade completely abandoned trance in favor of underground sound - especially these artists include Pascal FEOS and Oliver Lieb
 
 ek vaikalpik vikaas ke taur par kuch kalakaaron ne trns ke saath anya shaileyon jaise drum'en'baas ko milaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Some other artists experimented with extremely subtle sounds
 niraash, trns ke atiranjit sanskaran "hard trns" yaa "hard style" kii simavarti style main chahak ke zarie sanyojit kiye gaye, jo hardkor or terrrcor kaa paraspar vyapan he
 Trance, more loyal to its roots, began to raise its head on the Internet, where a plethora of legal music download sites - including Juno Download and Beatport - provided enthusiastic listeners with the difficulty of downloading mp3s and uncompressed wavs
 Do not worry about the discovery of vinyl, which is updated on a weekly basis
 parinamswaroop, vanijyik or progressive trns donon ab adhik vishwavyaapee ho gaye hai, agar chart-bound nahin he to kam se kam sasha, tiesto, ATB, marcus shulj, armin vine vuren, BT, paul vine dick, pheri corseten, ebove and biond, blue stone, paul okenfold, shiller, solarestoman or america ke christopher laurence or jorge acosta jaise aakarshak kalakaaron ke saath apane sammaneey padon ko banaae rakhane main sakasham hai, haalanki navdith nirmaataa or DJ bhi saarvajanik domen main safalataa praapt kar sakate hai
 Trance typically operates at a speed of 130 to 155 BPM in a 4 / 4 time signature, 32 bit phrases, and is somewhat faster than house music but usually not as fast as psychedelic trance
 samay-samay par trns kabhi-kabhi tej or kabhi-kabhi dhimi ho sakati he
 a kick drum is placed on each downbit and a regular open hi-hat is often placed on the upbit
 iske alaava kuch saral atirikt talwadan tatwon ko saamanytah joda jaataa he or aksar pramukh sankraman, nirmaan yaa clymex, lambe snair rolls ke dwaara aachhadit hote hai - snair drum ke samaan antaraal vaale thap se padbandh yaa vaakyansh ke ant main volum kaa nirmaan hota he
 For both the short pizzicato element and the long sweeping string sound, simple sawtooth-based sound is used as the central element synthesizer form of most trance tracks
 electronic sangeet ke anya shaileyon ke rup main mahatvapurn synthesisers rolland TR-808 or TR-909 TB-303 he, jo "acid" dhwani kaa strot he
 It also has many synthesizer sounds that are almost entirely unique to its genre
 in dhvaniyon main se ek dhwani "superso" he jo rolland JP-8000, novations supernova or korg MS2000 ke rup main prasidgh clasik trns synthesisers dwaara ek tarang rup ko banaaya gaya tha
 a technique known as "gutting" often produces pioneering sound
 Rapid arpeggio and small ratios are its common features
 trns treks aksar ek kendriya "hook" melody kaa prayog karti he jo lagbhag puure geet main chalati he or 2 bits or anek rukaawaton ke bich kahin bhi antaraal main dohraye jate hai
 While there are many tracks that do not include lyrics, other tracks rely on the song itself and thus develop a sub-genre
 dhwani or utpaadan kii gunvattta uplabdh takanic par ek ucch degree ke liye nirbhar he
 Typical analog instruments with names such as Moog, Roland and Overheim in the original trance sound palette still occupy the hearts of many manufacturers and supporters
 haalanki mukhyadhara kii digital praudyogiki kii uplabdhta nirmaataa ke puure nae samoohon ko ubharne kii anumati detii he kyonki sheersh shelf digital synthesisers kaa mulya hajaaron america dollar ke hote hai or uski kaaphi maang hoti he or svachh puraane anuroop synthesisers ke kaaran unke behad mahange hone kaa kaaran hota he
 Trance records are often heavy with reverberation and synthesizers often have delayed effects on the sound, song and often parts of the percussion sections
 yah trns nirmaataaon ko style kii gunvattta praapt karne kii disha main pravruth hone ke liye vishaal spes kii bhaavana ke saath treks pradaan karata he
 Flangers, phasers, and other effects are also commonly used in extreme settings - trance requires no sound similar to real-world instruments, so the manufacturer has independent reins

 shuruyaat or ant ke dauraan record ke anurup "bild ap, streep down" vyavastha ko "DJ mitra" kehete hai
 Since trance is more melodic and harmonic than most dance music, it is very important to be composed in such a way as to avoid inconsistent mixing by djs, which does not mix by vocal accompaniment
 
 Trance music is divided into several types of genres
 kaal krmanusaar pramukh sheliyaan clasik trns, acid trns, progressive trns or aplifting trns hai
 Uplifting trance is also known as "anthem trance", "epic trance", "stadium trance" or "euphoric trance"
 aplifting trns ke kaaphi kareebi euro-trns he, jo atyadhik vyavsaayik european nrity sangeet ke vyapak kism ke liye ek saadhaaran shabd ban gaya he
 There is a process of development of many genres, along with other major genres of electronic music

 The balearic beat, which is associated with the lead back vacation lifestyle of Ibiza, Spain, is often referred to as "ibiza trance"
 isi tarah dream trns ko kabhi-kabhi "dream house" kaha jaataa he or is shithil trns kii ek up-style ko 90 ke dashak ke madhya main robert miles dwaara maarg prashast kiya gaya he
 Another important difference is in European trance and Goa trance which originated in Goa, India and around the same time this trance was also developed in Europe
 cicedelik trns ke gathan main goa trns prabhaavshaalee rahe the, jisaki visheshta spezi, sahaj namoonay or anya cicedelik tatv he
 Trance is also very popular in Israel, with psychedelic trance such as Infected Mushroom and producers like Yhel Sherman gaining worldwide fame

 The trance music festival attracts a large crowd and usually features sophisticated lighting, lasers and bright displays

 kalil yaa colide ek rasaynic mishran hota he jisame ek vastu duusari vastu me samaan rup se parikshepit hoti he
 The particles of the dispersed object remain suspended only in the mixture and not as a solution
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki kalil me kanon kaa aakaar vilyan me upasthit kanon ke aakaar se bada hota he - yah kan itane chote hote hai ki mishran me puri tarah parikshepit ho kar ek samroop mishran taiyaar karen, lekin itane bade bhi nahin hote hai ki prakaash ko prakirnit karen or naa ghulein
 Due to this reflection, some of the solutes look like solution

 iske vipareet sharkara, uria, sodium, chloride ityadi ke jalavilayan jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikal jate hai
 The former type is found in most of the amorphous form on the basis of this property
 Soluble substances in water are divided into two classes: those substances which were crystalline and after solution in water can be released from the pores of the bio-membranes
 , Called crystalloids, and others, which were amorphous and could not be able to come out of the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water, were called kalil
 kintu ab yah siddh ho gaya ki sharkara or sodium chloride aadi crystalia padaarth bhi upyukt madhyam main kalil ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
