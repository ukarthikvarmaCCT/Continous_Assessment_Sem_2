 Since there is a provision in the Act that at least seven persons can organize a Loksamavaya together, so the remaining six persons of one person's family would be given a share
 at: ek vyakti dwaara niyantrit samavaay ko bure din dekhne padate the or ant main vah samavaay ladkadaa jaataa tha
 At the time of closing, the situation of that group was as follows- apratibhoot uttamarnon kii ore se yah tark prastut kiya gaya ki yadhyapi samavaay samamelit rahaa he tathaapi samavaay kaa kabhi bhi swatantra astitv nahin rahaa he

 Mythological plot shiv parvati ke putr swami kartikeya or ganesh donon bhai vivaah ke liye aapas main kalah karne lage
 Karthikeya said that they are older, so they should be married first, but Shri Ganesh wanted to get married first
 is jhagade par faisla dene ke liye donon apane mata-pita bhavani or shankar ke paas pahunche
 His parents said that whoever revolves around this earth and will come here first, he will be married first
 shart sunate hi kartikeya ji prithvi kii parikrama karne ke liye daud pade
 Here, the giant Shri Ganesh ji and his vehicle were also a mouse, how could they revolve so fast
 ganesh ji ke saamne baari samasya upasthit thi
 Shree Ganesh ji is definitely grosser than the body, but he is the ocean of wisdom
 unhone kuch soch-vichaar kiya or apni mata parvati tathaa pita devadhidev maheshwar se ek asana par baithne kaa aagrah kiya
 After sitting on the posture of both of them, Sriganesh performed seven circumambulation of them, then duly worshiped - pitroshch pujanan kruthva prakaantin c karoti yah
 Tasya va Prithivijyamin phal bhavati surem 
 In this way, Shree Ganesh became an officer of the orbiting of the parents and received the fruits obtained from the orbit of the earth
 unki chatur buddhi ko dekh kar shiv or parvati donon bahut prasann hue or unhone shriganesh kaa vivaah bhi kara diya
 At the time when Swami Karthikeya came back revolving around the whole earth, at that time Shree Ganesh ji was married to Vishwaroop Prajapati's daughters Siddhi and Wisdom
 itnaa hi nahin shri ganeshji ko unki ‘siddhi’ naamak patni se ‘kshem’ tathaa buddhi naamak patni se ‘laabh’, ye do putraratna bhi mil gayi the
 Devarshi Narada, who is a wanderer and welfare of the world, narrated this account to Swami Karthikeya
 shriganesh kaa vivaah or unhen putr laabh kaa samachar sunakar swami kartikeya jal uthe
 Angered by this episode, Karthik, following his courtesy, touched his parents' feet and left
 mata-pita se alag hokar karthik swami kronch parvat par rahane lage
 Shiva and Parvati understood and extinguished their son Kartikeya and sent Devarshi Narada to Kraunchparvat
 devarshi naarad ne bahut prakaar se swami ko manaane kaa prayaas kiya, kintu ve waapas nahin aaye
 After that, the soft-hearted mother Parvati became distraught with affection

 Somebody used to hide the milk of that shyma everyday
 ek din us kanya ne kisi chor ko shyama kaa doodh duhate hue dekh liya, tab vah krodh main agbabula ho usko maarane ke liye daud padi
 When she reached near Gau, she was not surprised, because there she could not see anything except a Shivling
 aage chalakar us rajkumaari ne us shivlinga ke upar ek sundar sa mandir banavaa diya

 Hydrogen cyanide is produced at the industrial level
 anekon rasinic yogicon ke nirmaan main yah atyant upyogi he
 The method of obtaining it in the laboratory is: 100 ml
 sandra salphurik amla kaa utane hi jal main thandha vilyan ek gol pendi ke flask main rakhe 100 gram potacium cynide ke upar kramash: daalate hai
 This flask is connected to a tube containing filled dehydrated calcium chloride
 is nalee se nikalanevaale vaashp ko ek sanghnitr se le jaakar draveebhoot karke ikattha kar lete hai
 -10 ° c in place of water in condenser
 They dissolve heat, salt in water
 yadi praapt amla ko or adhik nirjalit karnaa ho, to usamen kuch phosphorus pentoxide daalkar hilaate hai or drav kaa pun: aswan kar lete hai
 The commercial method of making prussic acid is: Aqueous solution of 23% sodium cyanide reacts with sulfuric acid inside a generator with lead levels and condenses and collects the vapors obtained by this action
 is kriya ke antargat amla kii maatra ko cynide kii maatra se adhik rakhaa jaataa he
 Partial distillation of the liquid thus obtained gives prusic acid of about 98% concentration
 isi prakaar sodium cynide ke sthaan par calcium cynide lekar bhi ise praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In Germany, a significant amount of this acid is also made from molasses obtained from the sugar beet industry
 in vidhiyon ke atirikt sanshleshan dwaara bhi prusik amla praapt kiya jaataa he
 There are two major methods for this
 pehali vidhi main kisi hydrocarbon tathaa ammonia ke mishran kaa niyantrit oxikaran kiya jaataa he
 a hot mixture of methane, ammonia and a small amount of oxygen, flows over the lattice of platinum-iridium
 nimnlikhit kriya ke falswaroop prusik amla praapt ho jaataa he : Other hydrocarbons may also be used in place of methane, but the reaction is much better than methane
 farmamide ke nirjaleekaran dwaara bhi prusik amla banaaya ja saktaa he
 The vaporized formamide was mixed with a large amount of ammonia at 360 ° c above the catalyst, aluminum phosphate
 Heating is carried on: uparyukt sameekaran rasinic kriya pradarshit karata he
 The pricic acid thus formed is absorbed in a sodium hydroxide solution, which is obtained as sodium cyanide
 prusik amla kaa kvathanank 25

 he
 On cooling, it freezes into a solid like ice, whose freezing point is -14
9 ° C
 is
 jami avasthaa main bhi yah kaaphi vashpashil hota he
 Its molecules are strongly polar in nature and in this respect it exhibits great similarity to water
 jal kii hi tarah yah ynikarak vilaayak bhi he
 It is miscible in every proportion with water and other organic solvents
 prusik amla main vidyaman tatv hydrogen, carbon tathaa nitrogen nimnlikhit do sambhav prakaaron se sanyukt ho sakate hai
 Which are called normal forms and iso forms
 dysomothen par prusik amla kii abhikriya se methil cynide tathaa methil iso cynide donon praapt hote hai
 It is clear that these two forms exist together in liquid prussic acid and they exhibit movable isomerism or conductivity
 jaleey vilyan main 12rusein
 par prusik amla kaa viyojan sthiraank 1
3v10-2 he, jo carbonic amla ke viyojan sthiraank kaa hi hota he
 Therefore, it is clear that it is very weak acid
 shuddh avasthaa main prusik amla sthaayee padaarth he, jise kaanch ke bartan main kaaphi din tak aparivartit avasthaa main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In the presence of some alkaline substances, such as ammonia or sodium cyanide, the polymerization of the acid begins, respectively, and as a result of this action, a dark substance is obtained which has almost the same chemical organization as prusic acid
 is kriya main paryaapt maatra main ooshmaa nikalati he
 Also, by applying heat, the velocity of the reaction also increases
 at: adhik maatra main is padaarth kaa bahulkikaran hone se taap kii vruddhi ke saath saath visphot ho jane kii bhi kaaphi sambhaavna rahati he
 This acid can be made permanent in the presence of acid or water-producing substances
 is amla ke astor saadhaaran vidhi se nahin banaae ja sakate
 For this, the action of sodium or potassium cyanide on alkyl halide or sulfate is required: iske atirikt alkil cynide, amlon ke amidon ke anadrikaran se bhi banaae ja sakate hai, jisase spasht he ki yah yogic saamaanya cynide mu-kaa naa hai tathaa inako un amlon kaa nitril bhi kehete hai, kyonki inke jayeepghatan se ve amla praapt ho jate hai: Prusic acid reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form additive substances and these compounds have special importance in the synthesis of hydroxy acids
 prusik amla ethilin oxide se ethilin sainahyderin banaata he, jo kuch utprerakon kii upasthiti main asut kiye jane par jal kaa ek anu nikaalkar ek yogic acrilo nitril banaata he
 This compound has special significance in synthesized rubber, fiber and other industries
 at: uparyukt kriya is yogic ke vyapaarik nirmaan main kaam aati he
 The action of prussic acid with chlorine produces cyanogen chloride and similarly cyanogen bromide with bromine, which are of great use
 amlon kii upasthiti main prusik amla jal ke 1 yaa 2 anu lekar farmamide yaa ammonia formet banaata he
 And its water decomposition produces ferric acid
 iske hydrogenikaran yaa apchayan se methil emin banataa he
 In most reactions, cyanide radical behaves like a non-associative non-metallic element
 jis prakaar dhaatuon ke hellide hote hai, usee prakaar dhaatuon ke cynide bhi hote hai
 This similarity is more pronounced in cyanides of alkaline metals, such as sodium or potassium cyanide
 iske atirikt cynojan mulak jatil yogic bhi banaata he, jaise potacium pherocynide, 
 The metals of the eighth class and in the transition metal have great potential to form complex cyanides
 vyavsaayon main prayukt honevaale prusik amla ke lavenon main sodium cynide pramukh he
 In pure state it is obtained by the reaction of castor sodium on ammonia and coal by the method of castor
 ise, prusik amla ko sodium hydroxide vilyan main avashoshit karke bhi banaaya ja saktaa he, par is prakaar praapt sodium cynide kam shuddh hota he
 The salt obtained is soluble in water, alcohol and non ammonia and its melting point is 563
7 ° C
 is
 jaleey vilyan main yah apaghatit ho jaataa he, jiske falswaroop prusik amla tathaa sodium hydroxide praapt hote hai: Sodium decomposition and ammonia are obtained by water decomposition after heating an aqueous solution of sodium cyanide
 isi prakaar potacium cynide bhi praapt ho saktaa he
 Both these salts of prussic acid have special importance in the activities of organic chemistry
 is lavan kaa vyavsaayik mahatv, calcium cynide dwaara ise nirmaan ke kaaran bahut bad gaya he
 In pure state, it is in the form of white powder and it is used as a fumigant
 kuch anya dhatvik cynide, jaise kupramacynide, silvercynide tathaa jiksynide anek vyavsaayon tathaa rasinic kriyaaon main kaam aate hai
 Potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferrocyanide are hybrid salts of prussic acid, which are of great importance in chemical analysis, in the Prussian indigo, in the dyeing industries, and in pigments called iron cyanide indigo
 prusik amla tathaa iske lavan, jaise potacium cynide, bahut vifaille padaarth hai tathaa bahut hi kam maatra main bhi ghaatak siddh hote hai, jo koshikeey oxikaran kriya ke avarodhan ke kaaran hota he
 Symptoms of this toxin are senile, nausea, stuttering, unconsciousness and finally death
 is vish ke praathmik upachaar ke liye rogi ko khuli hawa main litaakar garam rakhana chahie
 If breathing is going on, take a few drops of amyl nitrite in a cloth in the nose for about 30 seconds or smell the ammonia aromatic spirit
 yadi rogi ko kuch hosh ho to use ek prati shat sodium thayosulphate yaa sabun kaa jal mukh dwaara prati 15 minute main dena chahie, jab tak ki vaman na hone lage
 The unconscious patient should not give anything out of the mouth
 yah vish itnaa teevr hota he ki koi virala hi batch paata he or mrityu bahut jald ho jaati he
 The importance of prusic acid for the control of common insects and perishable insects was first known in California in 1886 as a deciduous antidote in orange trees
 godaamon, jahaajon, relon aadi main jahaan saamaan ikattha rahata he, iskaa upyog dhoomak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Prusic acid is stored in iron cylinders for this purpose
 iske atirikt anya roopon main bhi iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Calcium cyanide is used as a dehydrating antidote, which gives vapor of prussic acid by the moisture of the air
 chuuhe, bijju aadi ke maarane main bhi calcium cynide kaa prayeg karte hai
 Nests of ants, termites etc
 can be destroyed by fumigation by calcium cyanide
 anaaj ke godaamon main dhoomikaran main bhi calcium cynide kaa upyog hota he

 Hypothyroidism or latent hyperactivity is a pathological condition in humans and animals caused by insufficient production of the thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland
 avatuvamanta hypothyridism kaa hi ek rup he jo chote bacchon main paaya jaataa he
 About three percent of the general population suffers from hypothyroidism
 kuch kaarak jaise iodine kii kami yaa iodine-131 ke sampark main aane se iskaa khatara bad jaataa he
 There are many reasons for hypothyroidism
 itihaas main or vartmaan main kai viksit deshon main, iodine kii kami duniya bhar main hypothyridism kaa sabase aam kaaran he
 In individuals who have sufficient iodine, hypothyroidism is mostly due to Hashimoto thyroiditis, or due to a deficiency of the thyroid gland or a deficiency of one of the hypothalamus or pituitary glands
 hypothyridism prasav pashchaat thairoditis ke parinamswaroop bhi ho saktaa he, yah ek aisi sthiti he jo lagbhag 5% mahilaon ko bachche ko janm dene ke baad ek varsh ke bheetar prabhavit karti he
 The first phase is typically hypothyroidism
 iske baad yaa to thyroid apni saamaanya avasthaa main laut jaati he yaa mahila main hypothyridism viksit ho jaataa he
 In women who have hypothyroidism related to postpartum thyroiditis, one in every five women has permanent hypothyroidism that needs to be treated throughout their life
 hypothyridism kabhi kabhi anuvanshiki ke parinamswaroop bhi hota he, kabhi kabhi yah aling gunasutra par aprabhavi lakshan ke rup main upasthit hota he
 Hypothyroidism is a more common sexual disease in pet dogs, with its definite predisposition in certain breeds
 asthaayee hypothyridism volf-shaikof prabhaav ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 Very high amounts of iodine can be used to temporarily treat hypothyroidism, especially in emergencies
 haalanki iodine thyroid hormone ke liye ek sabstrate he, iske ucch str thyroid granthi ko bhojan ke saath kam maatra main iodine lene ke sanket dete hai, jisase hormone kaa utpaadan kam ho jaataa he
 Hypothyroidism is often classified by its organ of origin: hypothyridism lithium aadhaarit mood sthirikarkon ke kaaran ho saktaa he, jinka upyog aamtaur par dwidhruviya vikaar ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he ke rup main janaa jaataa tha)
 Additionally, patients with hypothyroidism and psychiatric symptoms can also be diagnosed with: vayaskon main, hypothyridism nimnlikhit lakshanon se sambandhit hota he: To diagnose primary hypothyroidism, many doctors measure the thyroid stimulating hormone normally produced by the pituitary gland
 iske atirikt, nimnlikhit maapan kii aavashyaktaa bhi ho sakati he: Hypothyroidism is treated with levorotatory forms of thyroxine triiodothyronine
 thyroid therapy main vartmaan maanak upachaar keval levothyroxin he or american association of clinical endocrinologist ke anusaar nirjaleekrut thyroid hormone, thyroid hormone ke sangyojan, yaa triyodothyronin kaa upyog saamaanya rup se pratisthaapan therapy ke liye nahin kiya janaa chahie
 phir bhi, is baat par kuch vivaad he ki yah upachaar protocol anukool he yaa nahin or haal hi adhyayanon ne kuch virdohi parinaam prastut kiye hai
 Two recently conducted studies comparing synthesized T4 to synthesized T4 + T3 show that "combination therapy has improved both cognition and mood
" ek or adhyayan jisamen sanshleshit T4 or nirjaleekrut thyroid nishkarsh kii tulana kii gayi, darshaate hai ki jab vishisht marijon ko sanshleshit T4 se badal kar nirjaleekrut thyroid nishkarsh diya gaya tab sabhi lakshanon kii shreniyon main sudhaar dekha gaya
 However, other studies have found that people who were given combination therapy and possibly ill with non-psychotic hypothyroidism did not see any improvement in mental ability and mood
 kai chikitsak T3 ke upyog ke bare main mudde uthaate hai kyonki iskaa arddh aayu kaal kam hota he
 Subclinical hypothyroidism occurs when thyrotropin levels increase but thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels remain normal
 haal hi main kiye gaye ek or adhyayan main yah jaanch kii gayi ki kya upanidanik hypothyridism hrid-sanvahani rog ke jokhim ko bhi badha saktaa he, jaisaa ki pehle kaha gaya he, is dauraan ek sambhav maamuli vruddhi pai gayi or suzav diya gaya ki coronary hryday rog ke sambandh main aage aise adhyayan kiye jane chahie, "isse pehle ki is vishay main koi nirnay diya jaye

 bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan bharat ke 23 takneekee shiksha santhaan hai
 These institutions are "institutions of national importance" established by the Government of India
 2018 tak, sabhi 23 iaiti main snaatak kaaryakramon ke liye siton kii kul sankhya 11,279 he
 a description of the institutes: bhartiya praudyogiki sansthaanon kii sthapana kaa itihaas isvi san 1946 ko jaataa he jab jogendra singh nen bharat main ucch shiksha ke sansthaanon kii sthapana ke liye ek samiti kaa gathan kiya
 The committee constituted under the chairmanship of Nalini Ranjan government recommended the formation of such institutions across India
 in sifaarishon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pehle bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan kii sthapana kalakatta ke paas sthit khadgpur main 1950 main hui
 Initially the institute was located in Hijli imprisonment
 15 sitambar 1956 ko bharat kii sansad nen "bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan adhinium" ko manzuri dete hue ise "rashtriya mahatv ke santhaan" ghoshit kar diya
 Other institutions were established on the same lines in Bombay, Madras, Kanpur, and New Delhi
 assam main chaatr andolan ke chalate tatkaaleen bhartiya pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi nen assam main bhi ek bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan kii sthapana kaa vachan diya jiske parinamswaroop 1994 main guwahati main ai ai tii kii sthapana hui
 In 2001, Roorkee University in Roorkee was also given the status of Indian Institute of Technology
 bhartiya praudyogiki sansthaanon main shikshit abhiyantaaon tathaa shodharthiyon kii pahchaan bharat main hi nahin pure vishwa main he
 However, this identification is mainly from the engineers who have graduated from here
 in sansthaanon kii prasiddhi ke kaaran, bharat main abhiyantriki kii padhai karne kaa icchhuk prayek vidhyaarthee in sansthaanon main pravesh paane kii 'mahatvakanksha' rakhata he
 Admission to graduation at these institutes is based on a joint entrance examination
 yah pariksha bahut hi kathin maani jaati he or sirf is pariksha kii tayari ke liye desh bhar main hajaaron shikshan sansthaae chalaaye ja rahe hai
 These institutions are sometimes criticized that the people of India go out of their country in the greed to earn money from hard earned money and go to another country, due to which it does not get the expected benefits of India
 avadhi protist pehle 1866 main arnest haechkel dwaara istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Protists have traditionally been divided into several groups on the basis of similarities to "higher" states: a cell animal-like protozoa, a plant-like highly organized plant each of which has a shell and fungi-like mud fungi and Water molds
 These groups often overlap, they have been replaced by lineage-based classification
 haalanki, ve abhi bhi protist kii aakaariki or paristhitiki kaa varnan karne ke liye anaupchaarik naam ke rup main upyogi hote hai
 Protists are liquid waters that live in almost any environment
 is tarah ke shaiwal ke rup main kai protist, sanshleshak hai or mahatvapurn praathmik utpaadakon visheshkar plavak ke hisse ke rup main samudr main, paristhitik tantra main hai
 Other protists, such as kineto plastids and apicomplexa, are responsible for a range of serious human diseases such as malaria and sleeping sickness
 anya jeevon se protist ke pratham shrenee german jeev vigyaani jorge e gold aise ciliates or moongon ke rup main jeevon kaa ullekh karne ke protojoa shabd shuru kii he, jab 1820 main aayaa tha
 This group was expanded in 1845 to include all "unicellular animals", such as foraminifera and amoebae
 aupchaarik vargeekaran shrenee Protoctista pehle protist vah paudhon or pashuon donon ke aadim koshikeey roopon ke rup main dekha kya shaamil karnaa chahie jo tark he ki jaldi 1860 jon hogg, main prastaavit kiya gaya tha
 He defined Protoctista as a "fourth state of nature", in addition to the then traditional states of plants, animals and minerals
 khanijon ke rajya ke baad ek "aadim roopon ke rajya 'ke rup main paudhon, jaanwaron or protist chhodane, ernest haechkel dwaara vargeekaran se hataa diya gaya tha
 Herbert Copeland complained that "protoctista" literally meant "first established creatures", arguing that nearly a century later, the Hog's label revived, including Copeland Hachkel's period Protista bacteria that contain anucleated microbes
 avadhi protoctista ke kopland kaa upyog nahin kiya tha
 In contrast, Copeland's term included nucleus eukaryotes such as diatoms, green algae and fungi
 is vargeekaran jivan ke chaar rajyon ke rup main kavak, Animalia, planti or protista kii Whittaker kii baad main paribhaasha kaa aadhaar tha
 The state protista was subsequently modified to separate prokaryotes in the isolated state of monera, leaving the protists as a group of eukaryotic microorganisms
 yah protist yaa monera na to se sambandhit jeevon kaa ek samooh the spasht ho gaya ki jab in paanch rajyon, der se 20 veen sadi main aanvik Phylogenetics kaa vikaas jab tak sweekrut vargeekaran bane rahe
 Currently, the term protists either exist as independent cells that refer to unicellular eukaryotes, or they occur in colonies, not showing differentiation into tissues
 The protozoa period does not form the fiber that the host species of protists are referred to
 in sharton ke vartmaan vargeekaran main istemaal nahin kar rahe hai or in jeevon ke liye ullekh karne ke liye suvidhajanak tareeke ke rup main hi rakhaa jaataa he
 The classification of protists is still changing
 nae vargeekaran fatty, jaev rasayan or anuvanshiki ke aadhaar par sangheey samoohon ko pesh karne kaa prayaas
ek puure ke rup main protist paraphyletic hote hai, kyonki is tarah ke system aksar alag ho jate hai yaa rajya kaa parityag, bajaay eukaryotes ke alag linon ke rup main protist samoohon kaa ilaaj
 ADL dwaara haal hi main yojana
 aupchaarik rankon ke saath sangharsh or badale padanukramit soochiyon main jeevon ko suchi baddh nahin he ki ek udhaaharan he
 This classification is intended to be more stable and easier to update over the long term
 sangh ke rup main ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he jo protist, ke mukhya samoohon main se kuch, sahi par taxo box main soochibaddh hai
 Many uncertainties are still there, although considered to be monophyletic
 udhaaharan ke liye, excavates shaayad monophoilatic nahin hai or haptophytes or cryptomonads baahar rakhaa gaya he agar chromalveolates shaayad hi monophoilatic hai

 Gandhism is said to be a collection of ideas derived from the ideals, beliefs and philosophies of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was one of the greatest political and spiritual leaders of the freedom struggle
 yah aise un sabhi vichaaron kaa ek samekit rup he jo gandhiji ne jivan paryant jiya evam kiya tha
 When a person or institution is addressed as a Gandhian, it means one is adhering to the values and ideals established by Gandhiji
 satya evam aagrah dono hi sanskrit bhashaa ke shabd hai, jo bhartiya swadhinata sangram ke dauraan prachlit hua tha, jiskaa arth hota he satya ke prati satya ke madhyam se agrahi hona
 Gandhiji said, "I have nothing new to teach the world
" satya evam ahimsa to duniya main utane hi puraane hai jitne hamaare parvat hai
 Truth is paramount among the basic elements of Gandhism; And truth should be the pivot of any political institution, social institution etc
 ve apane kisi bhi rajnatik nirnay ko lene se pehle sachai ke siddhanto kaa paripaalan avashya karte the
 His loyalty to truth, non-violence, human freedom, equality and justice can be best understood from examples of his personal life
 kaha jaataa he ki satya kii vyakhya aksar vastunishth nahin hoti
 According to Gandhism, the observance of truth has not been suggested to be a spiritual truth
 yadi koi eemaandareepurvak maanata he ki ahimsa aavashyak he to use satya kii raksha ke rup main sweekaar karnaa chahie
 When Gandhiji returned home during the First World War, he said that he probably did not believe in participating in the war on behalf of the British
 gandhiji ke anusaar british samrajya kaa hissaa hote hue bharatiyon ke liye samaan adhikaar kii maang karnaa or samrajya kii suraksha main apni bhagidaari na nibhaana uchit nahin hota
 On the other hand, when Japan reached near India's border at the time of the Second World War, Gandhiji did not consider it appropriate to participate in the war, but instead advocated resorting to non-violence
 yah bhi dekhen: bramhchary, ahimsa, liyo tolstoy See also: Bhagavad Gita, Religion, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Christianity gandhi ji ke ansaar dharm or raajnneeti ko alag nahi kiya ja saktaa he kyonki dharm manushya ko sadaachari banane ke liye prerit karata he 
 Self religion is everyone's own, but religion makes man moral
 satya bolnaa, chori nahin karnaa, pardu:khakaatarata, dusron kii sahaayta karnaa aadi yahi sabhi dharm sikhaate hai 
 Only by adopting these values, politics can be done with service
 gandhi ji aadambar or karmkand ko dharm nahi maanate or jor dekar kehete hai ki mandir me baithe bhagwaan mere ram nahi he 
 Adopting the concept of Swami Vivekananda Ji's impoverished Narayan, he considers human service as the true religion
 vastav me unka vishwaas he ki prayek praani ishvar kii santaan hai or ye satya he; satya hi ishwar he 
 See also: Sarvodaya yah bhi dekhen: rangabhed, tiyananamen chowk kaa pradarshan 1989, africa-amareeki naagarik adhikaar andolan Anna Hazare, yah bhi dekhen: bharat vibhaajan, mahatma gandhi kii hatya In principle, Gandhiji was against the partition of India because it hurt his sense of religious unity
 He wrote in his letter Harijan on 6 October 1946 about the partition of India: jaisaa ki muslim lig dwaara rakhi gayi he purna rup se gaiyr-islamic he evam mujhe ise paapapurna kehete hue bhi koi sankoch nahin
 Islam has been in favor of brotherhood and unity of the whole of humanity, so those who want to form groups of fighting in India by splitting India are truly enemies of not only India but also Islam
 chaahe ve mere tukde tukde hi kyon na kar den lekin ve mujhe kisi galat cheez ko sahi maanane ke liye majaboor nahin kar sakate hamen apni drushti chhodne kii bajaay sabhi musalmaan bhaaiyon kaa dil pyaar se jeetna hoga New Orleans, an important city in the Louisiana state, drowned in Hurricane Katrina in 2005

 inhone phir presidency mahavidhyalay main bhautikee ke praadhyaapak kaa pad sambhala or jatigat bhedbhaav kaa saamana karte hue bhi bahut se mahatvapurn vaigyanik prayog kiye
 He made extraordinary progress in sending wireless signals and first started using semiconductors to capture radio messages
 lekin apni khojon se vyavsaayik laabh uthaane kii jagah inhone inhen saarvajanik rup se prakashit kar diya taaki anya shodhakartta inpar aage kaam kar saken
 After this, he made many discoveries in botany
 inhone ek yantra crescograph kaa avishkaar kiya or isse vibhinn uttejkon ke prati paudhon kii pratikriya kaa adhyayan kiya
 In this way, they proved that there is a lot of similarity between flora and animal tissues
 ye patent prakriya ke bahut viruddh the or mitron ke kehane par hi inhone ek patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 In recent years, their contributions to modern science are again being recognized

 He studied the effect of changing weather on plants
 iske saath saath unhone rasinic inhibitors kaa paudhon par asar or badalte hue taapmaana se hone vaale paudhon par asar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 By analyzing changes in cell membrane potential under different conditions, they came to the conclusion that plants are sensitive "they can feel pain, feel affection, etc
"
 bose ne alag alag dhaatu or paudhon ke tishyu par fatig rispance kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha
 He stimulated different metals by mixing electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal methods and noted the similarities of the cell and metal reaction
 bose ke prayogo ne simulated koshikao or dhaatu main chakree fatig pratikriya dikhaai thi
 Along with this, special cyclic fatigues and recovery responses were also studied for different stimuli in living cells and metals
 acharya bose ne badalte hue electrical stimuli ke saath paudhon badalte hue electrical pratikriya kaa ek graph banaaya, or yah bhi dikhaaya kii jab paudhon ko zehar yaa anaesthetic di jaati hai tab unki pratikriya kaam hone lagati hai or aage chalakar shunaya ho jaati hai
 But the zinc metal did not show this reaction when it was treated with oxalic acid

 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 hindu dharm ke anusaar, khatu shyaam ji kaliyug main krishna ke avatar hai, jinhone shri krishna se vardaan praapt kiya tha ki ve kalyug main unke naam shyaam se puuje jaayenge
 Shri Krishna was very pleased with the great sacrifice of Barbareek and gave a boon that as Kali Yuga descends, you will be worshiped in the name of Shyam
 tumhaare bhakton kaa keval tumhaare naam kaa sachche dil se uccharan maatr se hi uddhaar hoga
 If they worship you with their true mind and love, then all their desires will be fulfilled and all their work will be successful
 shri shyaam baba kii apurv kahani madhyakaalin mahabharat se armbh hoti he
 They were formerly known as Barbaric

 He was a very brave and great warrior since childhood
 unhone yuddh kala apni maan tathaa shri krishna se sikhi
 Pleased Lord Shiva by doing severe penance and obtained three unbroken arrows; In this way , he got the famous name of three gunadhis
 agnidev prasann hokar unhen dhanush pradaan kiya, jo unhen teenon lokon main vijayi banane main samarth the
 The war of Mahabharata had become unavoidable between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, when they received the news of Barbaric, their desire to join the war was also aroused
 jab ve apni maan se aashirwad praapt karne pahunche tab maan ko haare hue paksh kaa saath dene kaa vachan diya
 He rode on his blue horse with three arrows and a bow to the battlefield of Kurukshetra
 sarvyaapee shri krishna ne brahman bhesh dhaaran kar barbaric ke bare main jaanane ke liye unhen roka or yah jaanakar unki hansee udaayi ki vah maatr teen baan se yuddh main sammilit hone aayaa he; aisa sunakar barbaric ne uttar diya ki maatr ek baan shatru sena ko parrast karne ke liye paryaapt he or aisa karne ke baad baan waapas tunir main hi aayega
 If the three arrows are used, then the entire universe will be destroyed
 yah jaanakar bhagavan krishna ne unhen chunauti di kii is vriksh ke sabhi patton ko vedhakar dikhalaao
 They were both standing under the Peepal tree
 barbaric ne chunauti sweekaar kii or apane tunir se ek baan nikaala or ishwar ko samaran kar baan ped ke patton kii ore chalaaya
 The arrow momentarily pierced all the leaves of the tree and began to circle around the feet of Shri Krishna, as he hid a leaf under his foot; Barbaric said that you remove your leg, otherwise this arrow will pierce your leg as well
 tatpashchaat, shri krishna ne balak barbaric se poocha ki vah yuddh main kis ore se sammilit hoga; barbaric ne apni maan ko diye vachan ko doharaaya or kaha yuddh main jo paksh nirbal or haar rahaa hoga usee ko apana saath degaa
 Kष्णवोंवोंa knew that the Kauravas were sure to lose in the war, and because of this, if Barbarik supported them, the result would go to the wrong side
 at: brahmanroopi shri krishna ne vir barbaric se daan kii abhilaashaa vyakt kii
 Barbaric pledged them and asked for donations
 brahman ne unase sheesh kaa daan maanga
 Veer Barbarik was astonished for a moment, but could not stand by his word
 vir barbaric bole ek saadhaaran brahman is tarah kaa daan nahin maang saktaa he, at: brahman se apane vaastivak rup se avgat karaane kii prarthana kii
 Shri Krishna came into his real form as a Brahmin
 shri krishna ne barbaric ko sheesh daan maangane kaa kaaran samajhaayaa ki yuddh armbh hone se purv yubhumi pujan ke liye teenon lokon main sarvshereshth kshatriya ke sheesh kii aahuti deni hoti he; isliye aisa karne ke liye ve vivash the
 Barbaric prayed to them that they wanted to see war to the end
 shri krishna ne unki yah prarthana sweekaar kar lee
 Pleased with this sacrifice, Shri Krishna decorated Barbarik with the title of Best Hero in War
 unke sheesh ko yubhumi ke sameep hi ek pahari par sushobhit kiya gaya; jahaan se barbaric sampoorn yuddh kaa jayja le sakate the
 On the Dwadashi of the month of Falgun, he donated his head, thus he was called the donor of the head
 mahabharat yuddh kii samaapti par pandavon main hi aapasi vivaad hone laga ki yuddh main vijay kaa shrey kisko jaataa he? shri krishna ne unase kaha barbaric kaa sheesh sampoorn yuddh kaa sakshi he, atev usase behatar nirnaayak bhala koun ho saktaa he? sabhi is baat se sahamat ho gayi or pahari kii ore chal pade, vahaan pahunchakar barbaric ke sheesh ne uttar diya ki shri krishna hi yuddh main vijay praapt karaane main sabase mahaan paatr hai, unki shiksha, upasthiti, yudhniti hi nirnaayak thi
 He was seen only walking in the battlefield with his Sudarshan Chakra which was cutting the enemy army
 mahakali, krishna ke aadesh par shatru sena ke rakt se bhare pyaalon kaa seven kar rahi thim
 Shri Krishna Veer was very pleased with the great sacrifice of Barbareek and gave a boon that in Kali Yuga you will be known by the name Shyam, because in that age, the one who supports the loser is able to bear the name Shyam
 unka sheesh khatu nagar main dafanaaya gaya isliye unhen khatu shyaam baba kaha jaataa he
 a cow came to that place and was automatically pouring milk from her breasts
 baad main khudaai ke baad vah sheesh prakat hua, jise kuch dinon ke liye ek brahman ko soopurd kar diya gaya
 Once the king of Khatu city was inspired to build the temple in a dream and to beautify it in the head temple
 tadantar us sthaan par mandir kaa nirmaan kiya gaya or karthik maah kii ekadshi ko sheesh mandir main sushobhit kiya gaya, jise baba shyaam ke janmdin ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The original temple was built in 1027 AD by Roop Singh Chauhan and his wife Narmada Kanwar
 marwar ke shaasha thakur ke dewan abhaya singh ne thakur ke nirdesh par 1720 i
 main mandir kaa jirnoddhar karaayaa
 The temple took its present shape at this time and the idol was replaced in the sanctum sanctorum

 Khatushyam is the family deity of a large number of families
 shri khatu shyaam ji kaa balykaal main naam barbaric tha
 His mother, Gurujan and relatives knew him by this name
 shyaam naam unhen krishna ne diya tha
 He got this name because of his curly hair
 inaki kahani madhya kaaleen mahabharat se shuru hoti he 
 Khatushyam ji was earlier known as Barbarik
 He was the son of Ghatotkach, son of the super-powerful Bhima and son of Nag Kanya Hidimbi
 khatu shyaam ji bal avasthaa se bahut balashaali or vir the unhone yuddh kala apni mata hidimbi tathaa bhagavan krishna se sikhi 
 He worshiped Lord Shiva and received three unique arrows from Lord Shiva
 is tarah unhen teen baan dhari ke naam se janaa jane laga 
 Agni Dev was pleased and provided him with a bow that could give him victory in all three locos
 When the war of Mahabharata was going on between Korvo and Pandavo, when Barbarik came to know about this, he also wished to do battle
 ve apni mata ke paas gaye or bole mujhe bhi mahabharat kaa yuddh karnaa he to unki mata boli putr tum kiski taraf se yuddh karoge 
 Then he said he would fight on behalf of the loser
 jab vah yuddh karne ja rahe the unhen raste main unhen ek shri krishna mili 
 He asked where are you going
 tab barbaric ne sari baat bataai 
 Shri Krishna ji said in Kalyug, people will come to know you as Shyam
 Because you are with the loser
 Kuki Barbarik's head was buried in Khatu city, so he is called Khatushyam rishi vedavyas dwaara rachit skanda puraana ke anusaar mahabali bhim evam hidimba ke putr vir ghatotkach ke shastrarth kii pratiyogita jeetne par inkaa vivaah pragajyotishpur ke raja daityaraj moore kii putree kamkatankakata se hua
 Kamakatankakata is also known by the name "morvi"
 ghatotkach va mata morvi ko ek putr ratna kii prapti hui jiske bal babbar sher kii tarah hone ke kaaran inkaa naam barbaric rakhaa gaya
 These are the same heroic barbaric who are known today by Shri Shyam of Khatu, Avatar of Kaliyug, Shyam Sarkar, Three Bandhari, Sheesh Ka Dani, Khatu Naresh and countless other names
 barbaric ke janm ke pashchaat mahabali ghatotkach inhen bhagavan shri krishna ke paas dwarka le gayi or unhen dekhte hi shri krishna ne vir barbaric se kaha— he putr morvey! jis prakaar mujhe ghatotkach pyaara he, usee prakaar tum bhi mujhe pyaare ho
 After that Veer Barbarik asked Shri Krishna - Lord! What is the best use of this life? On hearing this innocent question of Veer Barbarik, Shri Krishna said - o son, the best use of this life is to always support religion by being a companion of benevolence and the weak
 jiske liye tumhen bal evam shaktiyaan arjeet kerani padegi
 Therefore, you worship Navdurga in the Mahisagar region and earn powers
 shri krishna ke kehane par balak barbaric ne bhagavan ko pranaam kiya
 Seeing his simple heart, Shri Krishna decorated Veer Barbarik with the name "suhridaya"
 tatpashchaat barbaric ne samast astr-shastr, vidya hasil kar, mahisagar kshetra main 3 varsh tak navadurga kii aradhana kii, sachhee nishtha evam tap se prasann hokar bhagwati jagadamba ne vir barbaric ke sammukh prakat hokar teen baan evam kai shaktiyaan pradaan kin, jisase teenon lokon par vijay praapt kii ja sakati thi
 Here he got the name "chandil"
 maan jagadamba ne vir barbaric ko usee kshetra main apane param bhakt vijay naamak ek brahman kii siddhi ko sampoorn karwaane kaa nirdesh dekar antardhyaan ho gayin
 When Vijay Brahmin arrived, Veer Barbarik completed the yagna of Pingal, Replender, Duhadruha and nine types of carnivorous Palasi demons by consuming them like fire
 us brahman kaa yajna sampoorn karwaane par devi-devtaa vir barbaric se ati prasann hue or prakat hokar yajna kii bhasmarupi shaktiyaan pradaan kin
 Once upon a time, Barbareek turned down the offer of snake girls on the road between Earth and Hades, saying that he had pledged to be a lifelong celibate
 mahabharat yuddh prarambh hone par vir barbaric ne apni mata morvi ke sammukh yuddh main bhaag lene kii ichha prakat kii
 Then mother ordered them to participate in the war with the promise that you will play the side of the loser in the war
 jab vir barbaric yuddh main bhaag lene chale tab bhagwaan shri krishna ne mahabharat yuddh ke pehle hi inako purv janm ke brahma ji dwaara praapt alp shraap ke kaaran evam yah sochakar ki yadi vir barbaric yuddh main bhaag lenge to kauravon kii samaapti keval 18 dinon main mahabharat yuddh main nahin ho sakati or pandavon kii haar nishchit ho jaaegi
 Thinking this, Shri Krishna decapitated the heroic Barbaric and denied the Mahabharata war
 unke aisa karte hi ranbhumi main shok kii lahar daud gayi, tatkshan ranbhumi main 14 deviyaan prakat ho gayin
 The goddesses disclosed the curse received by Brahma ji before the present birth of Veer Barbarik to all the warriors present as follows- deviyon ne kaha: "dwaparayug ke armbh hone se purv moore daitya ke atyaacharon se vyathit hokar prithvi apane gauswarup main dev sabha main upasthit hokar boleen— “he devgan! main sabhi prakaar kaa santaap sahan karne main sakasham hoon
 Bearing the burden of mountains, rivers, streams and all mankind, i continue to tolerate my daily activities with great pleasure, but i am deeply saddened by the atrocities of the Moore monster
 aaplog is duraachaari se meri raksha kiijie, main aapke sharan main aayi hoon
 " gauswarupa dharaa kii karun pukaar sunakar sari devsabha main ekadam sannata-sa chaa gaya
 After a while of silence, Brahma Ji said- "now the only way to get rid of it is that all of us should walk in the shelter of Lord Vishnu and pray to him to get rid of this crisis of the earth
 ” Then Yaksharaj Suryavarcha, who was seated in the assembly, said in his powerful speech - "O Gods, the Moor monster is not so glorious, which only Vishnu can destroy
 har ek baat ke liye hamen unhen ksht nahin dena chahie
 If you give me permission, then only i can kill him
 ” On hearing this, Brahma Ji said- “silly! i know your might, your ego has challenged this deity
 iskaa dand tumhen avashya milegaa
 Ignorant considering myself superior to Vishnu! You will fall from this deity to the earth now
 tumhaara janm rakshas yoni main hoga or jab dwaparayug ke antim charan main prithvi par ek bheeshan dharmayuddh hoga tabhi tumhaara shirochhedan swayan bhagwaan vishnu dwaara hoga or tum sadaa ke liye rakshas bane rahoge
 " brahmaji ke is abhishaap ke saath hi yaksharaj suryavarcha kaa mithyaa garv bhi chur-chur ho gaya
 He immediately fell at the feet of Brahma ji and said in a polite manner - “god! Forgive me for these words which came out by mistake, i am your refuge
 trahimam! trahimam! raksha kiijie prabhu!” Hearing this, Karuna sentiment in Brahma, he said - “watts! You have proudly insulted the Devas, so i cannot take this curse back
 haan, isamen sansodhan avashya kar saktaa hoon ki swayan bhagavan shri krishna tumhaara shirochhedan apane sudarshan chakra se karenge, deviyon dwaara tumhaare sheesh kaa abhisinchan hoga
 As a result, you will receive the boon of being worshiped like the gods in the Kali-yuga from the Lord Krishna
 ” After this, Lord Shri Hari also said to Yaksharaj Suryavarcha in this way- tatsatatheti tan praah keshwa devsansadi ! shiriste pujayishyanti devyah pujyo bhavishyasi !! Bhaartarth: "at that time in the assembly of the gods, Shri Hari said - o heroic! Okay, your head will be worshiped and you will be worshiped in the form and you will get fame
" " Devi Chandika again told all the people present there, "after seeing his curse culminating in the boon, Yaksharaj Suryavarcha became invisible from that deity, and in the course of time, in this earth, Ghatotkacha, son of Mahabali Bhima and barbaric form of Morvi
 Took birth in isliye aap sabhi ko is baat par koi shok nahin karnaa chahie or isamen shri krishna kaa koi dosha nahin he
 " ityukte chandika devi tada bhakt shiristivdam ! abhyukshya sudhaya sheeghra majran chaamran vyaadhaat !! Such as Rahu Shirshadwad Tachhira: Pranamam Tana! Bhaartarth: "after saying this, Chandika Devi quickly displayed the devotee's head with nectar and made it immortal and immortal like the head of Rahu and this newly awakened head bowed to them all and said-" i want to see war , You approve it
 " So Krishno Vach: Prah Meghagambhirvak Prabhu :! Yavanmahi sa Nakshatra Yavachandradivakarau! Tvatvam Sarvolokanam Vats! Pujyo Bhavasi bhavarth: tatpashchaat megh ke samaan gambheerabhashi prabhu shri krishna ne kaha— " he vatsa! jabatak yah prithvi, nakshatra he or jabatak surya, chandramaa he, tabatak tum sabhi ke liye poojaneey hooge
 Goddess Lokeshu Sarveshu Goddess Vad Vichrishyasi! Situation from self devotee Lokeshu Devinam Dasya !! bhavarth: "tum saidav deviyon ke sthanon main deviyon ke samaan vichrate rahoge or apane bhaktaganon ke samudaay main kul deviyon kii maryaada jaisi he waisi hi banaae rakhoge" Balānān this prophecy is aphrodisiac Kfodbwa :! Pitakasta: Driedenave Shamayyasasi Pujaat !! Sense: "your child's devotees who are suffering from Vata, Pitta, Kapha, will easily eradicate their disease" idan c shring maruhya pashy yuduun yatha bhavet ! ityukte vasudevan devyothambarama vishan !! Bhaartarth: "and look at the war as you climb on the top of this mountain, all the goddesses penetrated the sky at the behest of Vasudeva Shri Krishna
 " Barbaric headdress Girishrungambap Tatt! The world is not a cult of peace Tato war mahdbhut kuru pandava senyo: !! Bhaartarth: "veer Barbarik's sheesh reached the top of the mountain and his torso was cremated with classical method but the sheesh was not done after that there was a fierce battle between the Kaurava and Pandava forces
 " Yogeshwar Lord Shri Krishna made the head of Veer Barbarik irrigated with nectar by 14 goddesses who appeared in the battlefield and made that head immortal by granting it divinity, and Lord Krishna worshiped the head of Veer Barbarik in the form of God in Kali Yuga
 Blessed to fulfill the wishes of the devotees
 vir barbaric ne bhagavan shri krishna ke samaksh mahabharat ke yuddh dekhne kii apni prabal ichha ko bataaya, jise shri krishna ne vir barbaric ke devatv praapt sheesh ko unche parvat par rakhkar purna kii evam unke dhad kaa antim sanskaar shastrokt vidhi se sampoorn karavaaya


 At the end of the Mahabharata war, a mutual debate broke out among the Pandavas as to who goes to the credit of victory in the war
 shri krishna ne kaha barbaric ke sheesh se poocha jaae ki usne is yuddh main kiskaa parakram dekha he
 Then Sheesh of Veer Barbarik replied that this war has been won only because of Lord Shri Krishna's policy and in this war only Lord Krishna's Sudarshan Chakra was going on
 vir barbaric ke dwaara aisa kehete hi samast nabhmandal udbhashit ho uthaa evam us dev swarup sheesh par pushp kii varsha hone lagi or devataaon ne shankhanaad kiya
 After that, Lord Shri Krishna again bowed down the head of Veer Barbarik and said, "O Veer Barbarik, you will be worshiped everywhere in Kali Yuga and complete the desired work of all your devotees
 atev, aapako is kshetra kaa tyaag nahin karnaa chahie, hamalogon se jo aparaadh ho gayi hai, unhen krupa kar kshamaa kiijie
 " itnaa sunate hi pandav sena main harsh kii lahar daud gayi
 The soldiers re-irrigated the head with the water of holy shrines and hoisted their victory flag near the shisha
 is din sabhi ne mahabharat kaa vijay-parv dhoomdhaam se manaaya
 The character of Veevar Morveenandan Shri Barbarik is elaborated in the "second Subdivision 'qomarik Khand' under Maheshwar Khand" of Skanda Purana
 rishi vedavyas ji ne skanda puraana main "maheshwar khand ke dwitiya upkhand coumarika khand" ke 66 wein adhyay ke 115ve evam 116ve shloke main inaki stuti is alokik strotra se bhi kii he
 When Shri Krishna demanded his head from him, he offered his head to him without any hesitation and the devotees started calling him as the donor of the head
 shri krishna pandavon ko yuddh main vijayi bananaa chaahate the
 Barbarik had already pledged to support his mother with the loser and before the war, the head of a brave man had to be offered for the battle of worship, so Shri Krishna asked him to donate the head
 bhakton kii manyata rahi he ki baba se agar koi vastu maangi jaati he to baba lakhon-baar dete hai isiilie unhen lakhadaataar ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 As mentioned in this article, Baba pledged to support the loser, hence Baba is also called the loser
 haare hue kii taraf se yuddh karne kii pratigya v daadi maan hidimba se mili aadesh ke kaaran hi
 Barbarik and Baba's head were asked by Lord Vasudev due to the problem arising in the mind of Lord Shri Krishna
 kyonki ek to kuru sena atharah dinon se pehle khatm nahi ho sakati thi
 And the other fact was that Mahabali Barbarik fought on behalf of the loser, so in the end there is no one left except Mahabali Barbarik
 kyonki jis taraf se vah yuddh karte to saamne vaala kamjor ho jaataa
