 Baiju Bawra is a Hindi language film released in 1952
 yah prasiddh sangitajna baiju baavaraa ke jivan par aadhaarit he haalanki film kii kahani or baiju baavaraa par prachlit dantakthaon main kaafii asamanthaayen hai
 The film is directed by Vijay Bhatt and the lead actors are Bharat Bhushan and Meena Kumari
 film kaa kaal samraat akbar ke samay kaa he or baiju baavaraa apane pita kii mrityu kaa badla sangeet samraat tansen se lenaa chahta he
 Tansen was one of the new gems of Akbar's court
 badshaah akbar kaa yah aadesh tha ki koi bhi tansen ke mahal ke ird-gird nahin gaayegaa kyonki isse tansen kii sadhana bhang hoti he or yadi kisi ne aisi gustaakhee kii to yah samajha jaayegaa ki vah tansen ko pratiyogita ke liye lalkaar rahaa he or use majabuuran tansen se sangeet kaa muqaabala karnaa padegaa
 In this case, the loser will be given death penalty
 baiju tab baccha hi hota he, jab tansen ke santari baiju ke pita ko gane se rokane kii koshish karte hai or hathapayee main uske pita kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Before he dies, Baiju's father promises him that he will avenge his death
 badale kii aag main balak baiju sipaahiyon ke kheme se ek talwaar chura letaa he or jab sipaahi uskaa peechha karte hai to gaanv ke ek pandit shankaranand manmohan krishna uski jaan bachaate hai or vah unke saath rahane lagata he jahaan uski dosti ek mallaah kii ladki gauri se ho jaati he
 This friendship turns into love as they grow up and Baiju Bharat Bhushan and Gauri Meena Kumari spend a lot of time together, which the villagers do not like
 gauri ke pyaar main baiju apane pita ko diya hua vachan bhi bhul jaataa he
 One day the bandits arrive in the village and through his song Baiju saves the villagers from being robbed by those dacoits, but Dasyu Sardarni asks Baiju to go along with him
 gaanv ko bachaane kii khaatir baiju gauri ko bilakhta hua chhod daakuon ke saath ho letaa he
 In the bandits' den, Sardarni tells Baiju that she is actually a vassal girl and her name is Roopmati
 vah gaanv jisamen baiju rahata he uske pita kaa tha jise raja maan singh ne chin liya tha or uske pita ko marava diya tha
 Now she is taking revenge for this by robbing him in that village
 badla shabd sunate hi baiju ko apane pita ko diya hua vachan yaad aa jaataa he or vah tansen se badla lene ke liye us rajkumaari kii talwaar lekar nikal padataa he
 Upon reaching Tansen's palace, when he raises the sword to kill Tansen, he hears Tansen's alarm and the sword falls from his hand
 vah phir talwaar uthaakar tansen ke tanpure par waar kar detaa he
 When Tansen asks him why Baiju targeted Tanpura instead of Tansen's neck, Baiju replies that Tanpura's notes were preventing him from doing so
 tansen kahata he ki baiju koi suron kaa gyani prathit hota he or yah bhi kahata he ki vah kisi talwaar se marane vaala nahin he or yadi baiju suron main lipt koi bahut hi bhavuk geet pesh karegaa to tansen khud ba khud mar jaayegaa
 Hearing this, Baiju goes to the shelter of Swami Haridas to learn the real music and requests him to make him his disciple so that he can take revenge on Tansen by learning music
 swami haridas usase kehete hai ki man main krodh se nahin balki prem se sangeet sadhana safal hoti he or use ek veena dete hai taaki vah sangeet sadhana shuru kar sake or use apana shishy sweekaar kar lete hai
 The fire of revenge does not go out of Baiju's mind, but he goes into a Shiva temple and starts the prayer with full heart and he has immense reverence on Swami Haridas
 ek din vah swami haridas se milane aata he to use pataa chalata he ki ve itane biimaar hai ki chal-phir nahin paa rahe hai
 He sings such a song in the temple of his ashram that Swami Haridas leaves the cot and walks towards the temple
 mandir pahunchakar ve baiju ko aashirwad dete hai or use sangeet sikhaane kaa bidaa uthaate hai
 Here Gauri is going to eat poison in Baiju's sorrow, when the princess Roopmati comes and asks him to go to meet Baiju
 gauri baiju se milti he or waapas gaanv chalane ko kahati he lekin baiju yah kah kar manaa kar detaa he ki use tansen se apane pita kii maut kaa badla lenaa he or gauri ko peeche chhod shiv mandir se baahar nikal jaataa he
 Then Swami Haridas comes and gives Baiju the last Gurmantra saying that to become a true musician, he must feel true pain and for that he must feel true love and his grief
 gauri yah sun leti he or apane ko saanp se katwa kar baiju se yah kahati he ki ab vah baiju or uski sadhana ke bich kabhi aade nahin aayegi
 Gauri becomes dead like Baiju Badhavas and becomes a Bawra, due to which the film got its name
 vah bhagwaan ko kosta hua ek dard bharaa geet gaata hua tansen ke mahal ke baahar pahunch jaataa he or bandi bana liya jaataa he
 Princess Roopmati comes to free her from prison but is also caught herself
 ab baiju ke paas tansen se muqaabala karne ke sivaa or koi chaara nahin bachataa he
 The competition starts but there is no decision of winning or losing
 tab badshaah akbar yah elaan karata he ki jo sangemarmar ke pathar ko pighla degaa vah vijayi ghoshit kiya jaayegaa
 Baiju wins the contest and in return demands three things that the ban should be removed from the music, Princess Rupmati is released and her jagir returned and Tansen's life is finally lost
 phir vah akbar ke darbar se apane gaanv ke liye nikal padataa he
 On reaching this side of the Yamuna, he learns that Gauri is getting married
 vah mallaah se use us paar pahunchaane kaa anurodh karata he lekin yamuna main baadh ai hoti he or mallaah use manaa kar detaa he
 Baiju then rides himself in the boat and tries to play it
 yah dekh duusare kinare se gauri, jise tairnaa aata he, baiju ko bachaane ke liye nadi main kud padati he
 At the same time the boat of Baiju overturns and Gauri approaches Baiju
 baiju gauri se kinare waapas jane ko kahata he kyonki tairnaa aate huye bhi gauri itane tej bahaav main baiju ko nahin bachaa paayegi
 Gauri refuses and both drown
 shastreey sangeet pradhan film hone ke kaaran isamen ek gane ko chhod baaki sabhi gane raagon par aadhaarit hai

 Herman Minkowski was a lithuanian-german mathematician
 unhone sankhyaon kii jyamiti kaa srijan evam vikaas kiya
 He used geometric methods to solve problems of number theory and mathematical physics
 aadhunik ganit ke vikaas main harman minchovsky kaa yogadan atyant mahatvapurn rahaa he
 He formed the basis of modern function analysis
 unhone dwighati roopon ke gyaan ko bahut adhik vistaar diya
 He laid the foundation of a sub-topic of mathematics called 'geometry of Numbers'
 yah minchovsky hi the jinhone albert oinstin ke aapekshikta ke siddhant kii ganitiya neenv taiyaar kii
 Minkowski understood that Einstein's theory of relativity could be best appreciated in a non-euclidean space

 The dikkal continuum, also called dikkal, was designed by Minkowski to signify the geometry of the physical complex as suggested by the latter theory of relativity
 ham jaanate hai ki newtoni bhautikee athwa chirsmmat bhautikee main dik or kaal ko do bilkul alag-alag rashiyaan mana jaataa tha
 However, Minkowski demonstrated that the concept of relativity theory has mathematically required that time be combined with the three dimensions of length, width, and height, along with three space-related dimensions
 atah oinstin or minchovsky ke kaary ne darshaya ki vastav main dik or kaal bahut antarangta se paraspar sambandhit hai
 The single quadratic power of time and time is also called in its entirety the event space or Minkowski community in which the history over time of a single space point is represented by a curve or line and an event limited in time to a point

 It is well known that Hilbert greatly influenced the mathematical research process of the twentieth century by providing a list of major mathematical problems in his famous 1900 lecture
 parantu, yah baat bahut logon ko pataa nahin he ki hilbert ko unke vyaakhyaan ke liye yah vishay chunane kaa suzav minchovsky ne hi diya tha
 Minkowski wrote in a letter to Hilbert: "the most effective subject will be an attempt to foresee the future, that is, the outline of the problems that future mathematicians must engage in
" is prakaar aap yah sunishchit kar sakate hai ki log aage aane vaale kai dashakon tak aapke vyaakhyaan kii charchaa karte rahen
 Minkowski and Hilbert were primarily responsible for transforming Einstein's vision of mathematics as 'a unique source of scientific prolificacy' rather than as 'merely a tool of physical insight'
 minchovsky ne xurikh politechnic main albert oinstin ko ganit padhaayaa tha
 As a student, he had no particular interest in Einstein

 Minkowski's interest in bone shifted from mathematics to physics
 unhone bone ke bhautikee santhaan main samay bitaana shuru kiya jo us samay henrikh hertz kii adhyakshata main karyrat tha
 He even completed a Prayongshala course
 aisi report hai jo yah bataati hai ki hertz ne yuva minchovsky ko ratribhoj par bulaayaa
 Minkowski's association with Hertz did not last long because Hertz died in 1894
 usee varsh minchovsky ne bone chhod diya
 If Hertz had lived more, the situation would have been different

 It is worth noting the fact that new theories of Hertz mechanics were formulated in the early years of the 1890s

 apane uddeshy kii purti ke liye clin ne adhikariyon ko shuddh ganit main ek or chair sthapit karne ke liye taiyaar kar liya or isko grahan karne ke liye hilbert ko aamantrit kiya
 Hilbert had already received a proposal for the Lazarus Fuk Chair of Mathematics at the University of Berlin
 hilbert ne is shart ke saath goatingan kaa prastaav sweekaar karne kaa man bana liya ki unke saath minchovsky bhi goatingan vishvavidhyalay main clin ke sahyogi bane
 On the request of Clean, Prussian academic officials took the unprecedented decision to establish the Hilbert Chair

 In 1905 Minkowski together with Hilbert organized a seminar on the review of the principles of electrons
 san 1907 main unhone vidyutgatiki ke samikarnon par ek sanjha seminar yojit kiya
 For the remaining two years of his life, Minkowski was fully involved in the study of the equations of electrodynamics and the theory of relativity propounded by Einstein
 minchovsky ne vishisht aapekshikta ke vyapak siddhant ko dikkaal satatya ke padon main punarprastut kiya
 He demonstrated that the main conclusions of this theory could be derived only on the basis of mathematical rules and there was no need to experiment

 Then press the battery key and press the key with the galvanometer and look directly at the galvanometer
 is prayog ko teesri bhujaa ke pratiraadh ko badhaate hue baar-baar karte hai
 When the deflection of a galvanometer changes from one direction to another with a difference of 1 ohm in the third arm, it should be understood that the value of the unknown resistor is between those two values
 phir uuparavaali sangat bhujaaon main kramash: 100 om 10 omvaale avrodh rakhkar prayog karte hai
 In the case where there are no deflections in the galvanometer when the pressure keys are pressed, the bridge is balanced and the fourth resistance value is taken from the formula

 Experimental knowledge is quite different from dual education and preventive education, in which the pupil plays a relatively passive role
 ye sakriy adhyayan jaise abhinay siikhnaa, saahasik seekhney, swatantra chunaav seekhney, sahakaari shiksha, or seva karne ke saat padhanaa, se sambhandhit zarur he lekin ye sab iske paryaay nahi he
 Experimental knowledge is often used to refer to experiential learning, which is synonymous with b but experiential learning is a broad philosophy of education, and applied knowledge understands individual learning
 jaise kii agar anubhavatmak shiksha se tulana kiya jaae to praayogic gyaan thos mudda he jo shishy or seekhney ke sandhrb se sambhandhit he
 Acquiring education from experiential medium is ancient from the general concept

 Following this example, in the "concrete experience" phase, the learner physically experiences the bike in the "here and now"

 Experimental knowledge can occur without the presence of a teacher, and is fully tied to the process of taking meaning from a person's direct experience
 Although the benefit of knowledge is an inherent process that takes place realistically, some elements are required to learn real experience

 Kolb says that to gain real knowledge from an experience, the learner must have four abilities
