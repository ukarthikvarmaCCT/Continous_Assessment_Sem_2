 Aurangzeb's sister died in an accident in 1644
 aurangzeb is ghatana ke teen hafte baad agra aayaa jisase uske pita shahjahan ko usapar behad krodh aayaa
 He dismissed Aurangzeb from the rank of Subedar of Deccan
 aurangzeb 7 maheenon tak darbar nahin aa sakaa
 Later Shah Jahan made him the Subedar of Gujarat
 aurangzeb ne sucharu rup se shashan kiya or use iskaa sila bhi mila, use badakhshaan or balkh kshetra kaa soobedaar bana diya gaya
 After this he was also made governor of Multan and Sindh
 is dauraan wo faras ke safaviyon se qandahar par niyantran ke liye ladata rahaa par use haar ke alaava or kuch mila to wo tha- apane pita kii upeksha
 In 1652 he was rebuilt the Subedar of the Deccan
 usne golconda or bijapur ke khilaaf ladaaiyaan kii or nirnaayak kshan par shahjahan ne sena waapas bula lee
 This greatly hurt Aurangzeb as Shah Jahan was doing this at the behest of his brother Dara Shikoh
 san 1652 main shahjahan biimaar padaa or aisa lagane laga ki shahjahan kii maut aa jaaegi
 The power struggle started in Dara Shukoh, Shah Suja and Aurangzeb
 shah suza, jisane apane ko bengal kaa governor ghoshit karavaaya tha ko harkar burma ke arakaan kshetra janaa padaa or 1659 main aurangzeb ne shahjahan ko tajmahal main shahi khajaane ko karch karne ke zurm main najarband karne ke baad apane ko badshaah ghoshit karavaaya
 Dara Shikoh was hanged for treason
 aurangzeb ne kabhi bhi shahi khajaane ko swayan par karch nahin kiya
 The Mughals, especially since Akbar, had been lenient on non-muslims, but Aurangzeb was just the opposite
 aurangzeb ne jazia kar phir se aarambh karavaaya, jise akbar ne khatm kar diya tha
 He forced the Kashmiri Brahmins to accept Islam
 kashmiri brahmanon ne sikhon ke nauven guru teg bahadur se madad maangi
 When Tegh Bahadur opposed this, Aurangzeb hanged him
 is din ko sikh aaj bhi apane tyohaaron main yaad karte hai
 During the reign of Aurangzeb, there was a wave of war-rebellion-repression-climbing etc
 pashchim main sikhon kii sankhya or shakti main badhottaree ho rahi thi
 He eventually defeated Bijapur and Golconda in the south, but in the meantime Shivaji's Maratha army plagued him
 shivaji ko aurangzeb ne giraftaar kar to liya par shivaji or sambhaaji ke bhaag nikalne par uske liye behad fikr kaa sabab ban gaya
 After all, Shivaji Maharaja defeated Aurangzeb and Marathas in India increased their strength throughout the country even after Shivaji's death the Marathas harassed Aurangzeb
 is bich hinduon ko islam main parivartit karne kii niti ke kaaran rajput uske kilaaf ho gaye the or uske 1707 main marane ke turant baad unhone vidroh kar diya
 Aurangzeb's administration had more Hindus than other Mughal emperors and Shivaji was also involved
 mughal itihaas ke bare main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki duusare baadshahon kii tulana main aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sabase zyada hindu prashasan kaa hissaa the
 Historical facts show that during the reign of Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan, Hindus constituted 24 per cent of the various posts in the army, other important posts in the court and various geographical administrative units, which rose to 33 per cent during Aurangzeb's time
 em athar ali ke shabdon main kahen to yah tathy is dharna ke virodh main sabase tagada saboot he ki badshaah hindu manasabadaaron ke saath pakshpaat karata tha
 a large number of Rajputs were appointed to senior positions in Aurangzeb's army
 maratha or sikhon ke khilaaf aurangzeb ke hamale ko dharmik chashme se dekha jaataa he lekin yah nishkarsh nikaalte vakt is baat kii upeksha kar di jaati he ki tab yuddh kshetra main mughal sena kii kaman aksar rajput senapati ke haath main hoti thi
 Historian Yadunath Sarkar writes that at one time Shivaji himself was a mansabdar in Aurangzeb's army
 kaha jaataa he ki ve dakshin bharat main mughal sultanate ke pramukh banaae jane vaale the lekin unki sainya kushalta ko bhaanpane main naakaam rahe aurangzeb ne is niyukti ko manjuuri nahin di
 Aurangzeb lived a holy life
 apane vyaktigat jivan main vah ek adarsh vyakti tha
 He was completely free from all the enemies that were common among the kings of Asia
 vah yeti-jivan jeeta tha
 He was restrained in eating, drinking, dressing and all other amenities of life
 prashasan ke baari kaam main vyast rahete hue bhi vah apni jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye quran kii nakal karke or tapiyaan sikar kuch paisa kamaane kaa samay nikaal letaa tha
 Not only Aurangzeb, one thing is said about all the Muslim kings of medieval India that none of them were Indians
 vaise ek str par yah bachakaana or bematlab kaa tark he kyonki 17veen shatabdi ke bharat main raashtra jaisi avadharana kaa to kahin astitv hi nahin tha
 Even after this, however, this thing does not apply at least in the case of Aurangzeb
 yah mughal badshaah pakkaa ucchwargeey hindustani tha
 Its simple logic is that he was born in Dahod, Gujarat and was raised like children of upper-class Indian families
 puure mughalkaal main braj bhashaa or uske sahitya ko hameshaa sangrakshan mila tha or yah parampara aurangzeb ke shashan main bhi jari rahi
 Columbia University historian Alison Bush says that there was an atmosphere of encouragement to Braj in Aurangzeb's court
 badshaah ke bete ajam shah kii braj kavita main khaasi dilchaspee thi
 He patronized some big names of Braj literature such as Mahakavi Dev
 isi bhashaa ke ek or bade kavi vrund to aurangzeb ke prashasan main bhi niyukt the
 The official writing language of the court during the Mughal period was Persian, but before the rule of Aurangzeb, the language prevailing between the emperors and the courtiers had become hindi-urdu
 ise aurangzeb ke us patr se bhi samajha ja saktaa he jo usne apane 47 varshiya bete ajam shah ko likhaa tha
 The emperor had presented a fort to his son and ordered to be sung on the occasion
 ajam shah ko likhe patr main aurangzeb ne likhaa he ki jab vah baccha tha to use nagaadon kii aawaaj khub pasand thi or vah aksar kahata tha, ‘babaaji dhan-dhan!’ is udhaaharan se yah baat kahi ja sakati he ki aurangzeb kaa betaa tatkaaleen prachlit hindi main hi apane pita se baatcheet karata tha
 Emperor Aurangzeb acknowledged the importance of the religion of Islam, making the 'quran' the basis of his rule
 usne sikkon par kalma khudwana, nauroj kaa tyohaar manaanaa, bhaang kii kheti karnaa, gaanaa-bajaanaa aadi par roak laga di
 Banned the practice of sati in 1663 AD
 tirth kar punah lagaaya
 In 11 years of his rule, 'jharokha Darshan', in the 12th year, banned 'tuladan system', banned Hindu festivals in 1668 AD
 1699 i
 main usne hindu mandiron ko todane kaa aadesh diya
 'muhtasib' was appointed by Aurangzeb in large cities
 1669 i
 main aurangzeb ne banaras ke ‘vishwanath mandir’ evam mathura ke ‘keshav raay madingr’ ko tudwa diya
 He abolished about 80 taxes levied against the Sharia
 inhen main ‘aabwab’ naam se janaa jane vaala ‘raaydaari’ or ‘pandari’ naamak sthaneey kar bhi shaamil the
 Aurangzeb considered converting 'darul Herb' to 'darul Islam' as his important goal
 aurangzeb ke samay main braj main aane vaale tirth−yatriyon par baari kar lagaaya gaya jazia kar phir se lagaaya gaya or hinduon ko musalmaan banaaya gaya
 Aurangzeb's atrocities are mentioned in the compositions of poets of that time
 aurangzeb dwaara lagaaya gaya jajia kar us samay ke hisaab se tha
 Akbar abolished the Jaziya tax, but it was re-enacted during Aurangzeb
 jajia saamaanya karon se alag tha jo gaiyr muslimon ko chukaana padataa tha
 It had three levels and it was determined by the income of the person concerned
 is kar ke kuch apwaad bhi the
 The poor, unemployed and physically challenged people did not come under its purview
 inke alaava hinduon kii varna vyavastha main sabase upar aane vaale brahman or sarkari adhikari bhi isse baahar the
 Such was the religious tax zakat imposed on Muslims, which was necessary for every rich Muslim
 aadhunik mulyon ke mandandon par jajia nischitarup se ek pakshpaati kar vyavastha thi
 Modern nations cannot make such a distinction on the basis of religion and caste
 isiilie jab ham 17veen shatabdi kii vyavastha ko aadhunik rashtron ke paimaane par ise dekhte hai to yah bahut arajak vyavastha lag sakati he, lekin aurangzeb ke samay aisa nahin tha
 Other examples are also found in that period
 jaise maraathon ne dakshin ke ek bade hisse se mughalon ko bedakhal kar diya tha
 Their tax system was also biased at about the same level
 ve musalamaanon se jakaat vasuulate the or hindu aabaadi is tarah kii kisi bhi kar vyavastha se baahar thi
 Aurangzeb had built more temples than he had broken
 vishwaprasiddh itihaaskaar richard iton ke mutabik mughalkaal main mandiron ko dhahaana durlabh ghatana hua karti thi or jab bhi aisa hua to uske kaaran raajnneetik rahe
 According to Eaton, the same temples were demolished in which the rebels were given shelter or with the help of which a conspiracy was made against the emperor
 us samay mandir todane kaa koi dharmik uddeshy nahin tha
 Aurangzeb, notorious in this case, also followed the same rule of the Sultanate
 uske shasankaal main mandir dhahaane ke udhaaharan bahut hi durlabh hai or jo hai unki jad main raajnneetik kaaran hi rahe hai
 Aurangzeb, for example, never targeted temples in South India, while most of the army was stationed here during his reign
 uttar bharat main usne jarur kuch mandiron par hamale kiye jaise mathura kaa keshav raay mandir lekin iskaa kaaran dharmik nahin tha
 The Jats of Mathura revolted against the Sultanate, hence the attack
 thik iske ulat kaarnon se aurangzeb ne mandiron ko sangrakshan bhi diya
 This was his offering to Hindus who were loyal to the emperor
 kings college, landan kii itihaaskaar catherine butler to yahaan tak kahati hai ki aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tode, usase zyada banawaye the
 Scholars like Catherine Frank, m Athar Ali and Jalaluddin also point out that Aurangzeb had given grants to several Hindu temples, including the movable Bari Math in Banaras, Balaji Temple in Chitrakoot, Someshwar Nath Mahadev Temple in Allahabad and Umananda Temple in Guwahati
 Famous names are
 jis kalkhand yani mughalkaal main mandiron ko tode jane kii baat itani zyada prachlan main he, usamen hinduon dwaara kahin is baat kaa vishesh zikr nahin miltaa
 It can be argued that doing so in those times would not have been empty of danger, but even when the Sultanate came to an end in the 18th century, there is no mention of this
 ateet main mughal shaskaon dwaara hindu mandir tode jane kaa mudda bharat main 1980-90 ke dashak main garm hua 
 a big argument is also made in trying to prove Aurangzeb as fanatical that he had banned music, but this is also not true
 catherine bataati hai ki sultanate main to kya sangeet par uske darbar main bhi pratibandh nahin tha
 On the day the emperor took over the throne, every year there was a lot of dancing and singing in the festival
 kuch dhrupadon kii rachana main aurangzeb naam shaamil he jo bataata he ki uske shasankaal main sangeet ko sangrakshan hasil tha
 Some historical facts also point to the fact that he himself was well versed in music
 mirat-e-alam main bakhtawar khan ne likhaa he ki badshaah ko sangeet visharadon jaisaa gyaan tha
 Mughal scholar Fakirullah has recorded the names of Aurangzeb's favorite singers and instrumentalists in a document titled Raag Darpan
 aurangzeb ko apane beton main ajam shah bahut priy tha or itihaas bataata he ki shah apane pita ke jeevankaal main hi nipun sangeetkaar ban chukaa tha
 Talking about music flourishing during Aurangzeb's reign, Catherine writes, 'the highest commentary on music was written in Persian during the time of Aurangzeb, compared to the entire Mughal period of 500 years
 ’ haalanki yah baat sahi he ki apane jivan ke antim samay main aurangzeb zyada dharmik ho gaya tha or usne geet-sangeet se duuri bana lee thi
 But looking at the things we have mentioned above, it can be assumed that he never made his personal wish the official policy of the Sultanate
 aurangzeb ke antim samay main dakshin main maraathon kaa jor bahut bad gaya tha
 The imperial army was not getting success in suppressing them
 isliye san 1683 main aurangzeb swayan sena lekar dakshin gaya
 He stayed away from the capital, in the same campaign for the last 25 years of his reign
 50 varsh tak shashan karne ke baad uski mrityu dakshin ke ahmednagar main 3 march san 1707 i
 main ho gai
 He was buried in the compound of the tomb of Fakir Buruhanuddin in Daulatabad
 uski niti ne itane virdohi paidaa kar diye, jis kaaran mogul samrajya kaa ant hi ho gaya

 vaarshik rashifal main ek puure varsh main hone vaali mukhya ghatnaon kaa akalan kiya jaataa he
 The horoscope of the horoscope is the result of the events of the coming year by placing that zodiac in the ascendant house
 pracheen kaal main janm raashi ke varna ke anusaar naam rakhe jate thea, isaliye naam ko pratham varna ko dhyaan main rakhkar bhi log apana rashifal jaan lete the
 That is why it was said that if the name starts with this letter, then the coming year will be like this
 janm samay kaa vichaar kiye bina aaj bhi jab janm kundalee main grah yoga, dasha lagaaye bina anek vyaktiyon ke jivan main aane vaale varsh kii mukhya ghatnaon ko nikaalnaa hon, to chandra raashi ko kendra main rakh kar anya gochar ke anya grahon ko kundalee main bithaaya jaataa he
 For example, if a person is born in the Aries zodiac, then after the Moon is placed in the Aries zodiac sign in the ascendant of the horoscope, the other planets are positioned in the same way, in the sense
 vartmaan 2010 main shani kanya raashi main gochar kar rahe he, to kundalee main chandra kii sthiti kanya raashi main chathe bhav main hogi
 Guru is transiting in Pisces in the first month of December, due to this, Guru will be situated in the tenth house of Aries

 For the annual ascendant, the fruits of planets running at slow speed are considered
 isamen shani jivan kii bady ghatnaon ko bataata he, kyoki yah ek raashi main lagbhag dhai varsh tak rahata he
 Gurus live in a zodiac for almost a year, so they also reflect the long events of life

 Sixth house from Moon is called disease and debt
 chandra se saptam bhav daanpaty jivan kaa bhav he, chandra se ashtum bhav aayu va durghatnaon kaa bhav he
 The ninth house from Chandra is of luck and big trips
 isi prakaar chandra se dasham bhav aajeevika kaa bhav he
 The eleventh house is seen from the moon for income
 gochar main sabhi grah chand se ekadash bhav main hone par sadaiv shubh fal dete he
 In this way, looking at the position of Saturn, Guru and other planets, the situation of a person is assessed throughout the year

 Instead of being humiliated by the sharp words of such beauties and the daggers of neglected eyes, soldiers thought it better to lose their lives while fighting in the battlefield
 mahaan krantikari vinayak damodar saavarkar ne ajijan kii tarif karte hue likhaa he, ‘ajijan ek nartki thi parantu sipaahiyon ko usase behad sneh tha
 Ajijan's love did not sell for money in the ordinary market

 Otherwise, be prepared to face severe punishment

 Not only this, the lioness shouted and also said that the British should apologize, who have done so much oppression on the Indians

 He knew the consequences of saying this, but the freedom addict did not care

 Voting is a method of making decisions or expressing their views by which a group is able to take a decision after exchange of views and debate
 matdaan kii vyavastha ke dwaara kisi varg yaa samaaj kaa sadsy rajya kii sansad yaa vidhansabha main apana pratinidhi chunane yaa kisi adhikari ke nirvachan main apni ichha yaa kisi prastaav par apana nirnay prakat karata he
 In this view, this system is used in all elections and all parliamentary or direct legislatures
 adhinayakawadi sarkaar main adhinaayak dwaara pehle se liye gaye nirnyon par vyakti ko apana mat prakat karne ke liye kaha ja saktaa he, parantu apane nirnyon ko aropit karne ke adhinaayak ke vibhinn dhang is prakaar ke matdaan ko keval aupchaarik pravidhi tak simit kar dete hai
 In a democratic government itself, voting gets major area and importance
 pracheen bharat main gutikapaat ke atirikt matdaan dwaara bhi adhikariyon ke nirvachan kii vyavastha thi
 In religious institutions, especially in Buddhist associations, certain rules of election were followed
 "chullabagg" main saky dwaara matdaan kii teen pravidhiyon kaa ullekh he : gupt matdaan, kaan main kahkar mat prakat karne kii, pravidhi tathaa khulaa matdaan
 The Buddhist Sanghas used colored wood pellets as a ballot for secret ballot
 shalakaon kaa sangraahak matadaataaon ko rangon ke arth samajhakar unke mat sangrah karata tha or bahumat kaa nirnay maanya hota tha
 Voting system existed in Europe in ancient Greece and Italy
 pracheen rajtantron main yah prachlan tha ki kuch gambhir vishyon par swayan nirnay lene ke purv raja apni praja kii sanmati praapt karne ke liye use aamantrit kare
 The manner of expressing votes in such meetings was oral
 athens main gutikapaat ke atirikt jahaan matdaan kii vyavastha thi vahaan haath uthaakar mat prakat karne kii pratha thi
 But there was a system of secret ballot on subjects affecting the social level of an individual
 rome main idri pudru duusari shatabdi tak matdaan kaa dhang "vibhaajan" kaa tha
 But due to economic and social support of the majority of the voters, the system could not be suitable for independent voting

 Various theories have been formulated regarding the importance of modern democracy and its system
 in siddhanton ke falswaroop, aavashyaktaa ke samay sangharsh nivaaran kii saamaajik pravidhi ke rup main; shashan satta ke prati anuvritti praapt karne ke dhang ke rup main; saamaajik sangharsh ke bich saamanjasy sthapit karne ke saadhan ke rup main; thik paristhitiyon main thik nirnay praapt karne kii paddati ke rup main, saamaajik aavashyaktaaon tathaa asantoshon ko anaavriti kii vyavastha ke rup main; tathaa alpsankhyakon ko rajya ke laabhon se vanchit rakhane kii vyavastha se bachaane ke dhang ke rup main, matdaan ko manyata praapt hui he
 Recently, considerable attention has been paid to this problem to the extent to which those who have the franchise suffer to participate in the exercise of this right

 The doctrine of compulsory voting was first introduced in a canton called st
gallen, Switzerland, for which in 1835, it was imposed by the canton by legislation for those who did not take part in the elections of the District Council
 yah vyavastha swiss nagarikon ko matadhikaar ke uttardaayitv kaa anubhav karaane main safal hui he
 Also, as a result of this system, the work of political organizations to bring voters out of the house to get involved in voting has also become lighter
 isi prakaar bavaria ne san 1881 idri main, bulgeria ne san 1882 idri tathaa belgium ne san 1893 idri anivaary matdaan kii vyavastha apanaai
 According to Bavaria's system, if more than one-third of the total number of voters do not participate in voting, then absentee voters will have to bear the entire expenditure of re-election
 belgium ne anupasthit matadaataaon ke liye teen dand nirdhaarit kiye antarvivek par—arth dand, saarvajanik bhartsana tathaa matadhikaar apharan
 It is generally said in opposition to compulsory voting that this system does not leave any room for objectionists, however, the character of those who do not vote is not as important an issue as to what means to get votes
 Is used

 They are so powerful that no armor is imagined for them
 unke anya naamon main ragavrunt, anang, kandarpa, manamath, mansija, madan, ratikant, pushpavan, pushpadhanv aadi prasiddh hai
 Kamadeva, the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and Lord Vishnu's son and Krishna's son Pradyumna, is an incarnation of Kamadeva

 Kamadeva's bow is one of the strongest forms of nature

 Therefore, one corner symbolizes stability and one corner symbolizes versatility
 vasant, kaamdev kaa mitra he isliye kaamdev kaa dhanush phulon kaa bana hua he
 The command of this bow is voiceless
 yani, kaamdev jab kaman se tir chhodte hai, to uski aawaaj nahin hoti
 It is also understood to mean that decency in work is necessary
 tir kaamdev kaa sabase mahatvapurn shastr he
 It neither makes a sound before anyone it interferes with nor does it give a chance to the victim
 is tir ke teen dishaao main teen kone hote hai, jo kramash: teen lokon ke pratik maane gaye hai

 yah manushya ko karm karne kii prerana detaa he
 The third corner of Cupid's arrow is under Mahesh, which signifies Makar or Moksha

 That is, Kama is not only necessary for the creation of the universe, but also suggests the way for man to show the path of Karma and finally provide salvation

 The whole creation is governed by the same opposite sex attraction
 kaamdev kaa ek lakshya khud kaam hai, jinhen purush mana gaya he, jabaki doosraa rati hai, jo stri rup main jaani jaati hai
 Armor is a symbol of protection
 kaamdev kaa rup itnaa balashaali he ki yadi isaki suraksha nahin kii gai to viplav laa saktaa he
 That is why this armor is tied to the protection of Cupid
 yani surakshit kaam prakritik vyavhaar keliye aavashyak mana gaya he, taaki saamaajik buraaiyon or bhayankar bimariyon ko dur rakhaa ja sake
 When the demon Tarakasura created a fire, the gods begged Kamadeva to kill Tarakasura so that he could fall in love with Shiva and Parvati because Tarakasura had the boon that only Shiva and Parvati's son can kill Tarakasura
 to kaamdev tathaa devi rati kailash parvat shiv kaa dhyaan bhang karne ke liye gayi par kaamdev kaa baan lagane se shiv kaa dhyaan to bhang ho gaya par shiv ko bahut krodh aa gaya va shiv ne apana teesraa netra khol kar kaamdev ko bhasma kar diya tathaa rati ko bhi apane kii mrityu par krodh aa gaya to rati ne parvati ko shraap diya ki parvati ke pet se koi bhi putr janm nahi legaa
 On hearing this curse, Parvati became unhappy and Shiva explained to Parvati that she should not be sad and that Shiva married Nav Parvati
 jab devataayo ne is shraap ke bare me tathaa kaamdev kii maut ke bare me suna to vah bade vyakul ho gayi to devo ne chal se tarakasur ko vardaan dilaayaa ki tarakasur kaa vadh keval shiv ke pet se janamaa putr hi kar saktaa he

 The forehead is the highest part of the entire body, it gives directions
 hathi ko kaamdev kaa vaahan mana gaya he
 By the way, in some scriptures, Cupid is also said to be sitting on a parrot, but it is not included in the original concept
 prakruti main hathi ekmaatr aisa praani he, jo chaaron dishaao main svachhand vicharan karata he
 An alcoholic elephant can be seen in three directions and can be cautious even if a slight sound is made at the back
 hathi kaanon se har taraf kaa sun saktaa he or apni sound se chaaron dishaao main waar kar saktaa he
 Similarly, the character of Cupid is also seen
 ye svachhand rup se chaaron dishaao main ghoomte hai or kisi bhi disha main tir chhodane ko tatpar rahete hai
 Cupid also has the ability to detect any kind of voice immediately

 barooth di spinoja yahudee mul ke dach darshanik the
 His changed name was 'benedict de Spinoza'
 unhone ullekhneey vaigyanik abhikshmata kaa parichay diya kintu unke kaaryon kaa mahatv unke mrityu ke uparant hi samjha ja sakaa
 Spinoza was born in 1632 in Holland, a Jewish family
 ve swabhaav se ekantapriya, nirbhik tathaa nirlobh the
 He was shown greed to abandon his beliefs, conspired to assassinate him, was excommunicated from the Jewish sect, yet he remained adamant
 sansaarik jivan unako ek asay rog ke samaan jaan padataa tha
 Therefore, he used to be restless to get rid of him and attain God
 spinoja kaa sabase prasiddh granth unka 'athiks' he
 But in addition to this he has practiced seven or eight texts
 principles ov philasphi tathaa metaphysical cojitations kaa prakaashan 1663 main or trectatus thiologico polyticas kaa prakaashan 1670 main, bina unke naam ke hua
 His three incomplete texts are Tractractus Politicus, Tractatus de Intelectus Emendadione, Grammatis linguis Hebresi - published in 1677 the same year after his death, with his main treatise Ethics
 bahut dinon baad unke ek or granth trectatus brevis di deo kaa pataa chalaa, jiskaa prakaashan 1858 main hua
 Many texts have been written about Spinoza's life and philosophy, which are listed in Spinoza in the Light of Vedanta
 is kalpana kaa ki dravya kii sristi ho sakati he at: vichaartatv or vistaartatv dravya hai, spinoja ne ghor virodh kiya
 Matter is self-illuminated and independent, it cannot be created
 at: vichaartatv or vistaartatv, jo srist hai, dravya nahin balki oopaadhi hai
 Spinoza atheists can be said to mean that he opposed the idea of god prevalent in Judaism and Christianity
 spinoja kaa dravya yaa ishwar nirgun, niraakaar tathaa vyaktitwaheen sarvyaapee he
 To somehow make God special is to limit it
 is arth main spinoja kaa ishwar advait vedant ke brahm ke samaan he
 Just as Brahman has two titles, name and form, similarly Spinoza's two titles of matter are thoughts and extensions
 ye dravya ke gun nahin he
 Like the form of Brahman's form, matter also has properties that are proved by its form, such as its uniqueness, independence, perfection etc
 vichaar tathaa vistaar ko gun na kahkar oopaadhi kahana adhik uparyukt he, kyonki spinoja ke anusaar ve dravya ke swaroop ko samajhane ke liye buddhi dwaara aropit hai
 Such infinite titles are valid for Spinoza
 ishwar kii ye oopaadhiyaan bhi aseem hai parantu ishwar kii nissimta nirpeksh he vahaan in oopaadhiyon kii aseemta saapeksh he
 God is the creator of the world, but not in the form that he creates the whole world with his willpower
 vastav main ishwar main ichhashakti aropit karnaa usko simit karnaa he
 But this does not mean that God is not independent; His freedom is his secularism, not his free will, because of this Spinoza does not consider the world to be the purpose
 ishwar jagat kaa kaaran usee arth main he jisamen swarnapind aabhushan kaa yaa akaash tribhuj kaa
 But this does not mean that God is changeable
 jagat kalpit he kintu uskaa aadhaar ishwar satya he
 God and the world are different, but not divisible
 jis prakaar ishwar main ichhashakti nahin he vaise hi manushya main bhi swatantra ichhashakti naam kii koi vastu nahin he
 The reality is that each thought is caused by another thought, so no idea is independent
 saath hi spinoja kii vichaaragegat par bhautik jagat kaa prabhaav nahin padataa
 The work-cause-chain is different but both are the same substance, so they seem related
 vyavhaarajagat main spinoja niyativaadee jaan padate hai
 They say that the rejection of willpower does not affect our behavior and conduct, so it is unnecessary to avoid it
 vaastaviktaa to yah he ki yadi hamako yah drudh nishchay ho jaae ki sansar kii kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa icchanirpeksh he to hamako badi shanti mili
 Man remains unrestful as long as there is hope for change in the cause-chain
 ichaswatantray main vishwaas hi hamaara bandhan he
 Desire freedom should be used to resolve will
 ichaswatantray ke shaman se rajsik vritti tathaa maansik vikaron kaa shaman hota he or man ishwarchinthan ke yogya hota he
 The ultimate goal of life is the attainment of God, because only then can the attainment of eternal death
 ishwar kii prapti ishwar se prem karne se hoti he parantu prem kaa arth bhavukta nahin balki tanmayata he
 This is why Spinoza called this love intellectual love
 ishwarathnmayata kaa ek arth yah bhi he ki ham sadachaar sadachaar ke liye karen, kyonki sadachaar ke uplakshya main pratifal kii ichha rakhana ek bandhan kii sristi karnaa he
 When our mind becomes divine and our outlook is a constant approach, then we experience identification with God and attain absolute peace
 spinoja ke vichaar main ishwar ke sagun saakaar rup kaa bhi mahatv he
 This imagination is very useful for those whose intellectual level is low and for those who have awakened faith in their mind by virtue, realization of God
 ishwar ko na maanane kii apeksha sagun saakaar ishwar ko maananaa shreyaskar he
 Spinoza's idea was all-encompassing, which is why in today's era people are increasingly looking towards Spinoza

 The Gettysburg Address is a speech by US President Abraham Lincoln that counts among the most memorable speeches in American history
 ise linkan ne brihaspativaar, 19 navambar 1863 ko pansylvania rajya ke gatizberg shahar main rashtri sainik qabristaan ke samarpan diwas ke mauqe par padhaa jab america grihayuddh ko khatm hue saadhe-chaar maheene hue the or america do hisson main khandit hote-hote bachaa tha
 The entire speech was only about two minutes, but it reiterated in new terms the principles raised in the Declaration of Human Rights and American Independence
 angrezi main linkan ne kaha - Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure
 We are met on a great battle-field of that war
 We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
 It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
 But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground
 The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract
 The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here
 It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
 It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth
 Its Hindi translation is - aaj ham ek bhayankar guhayuddh lard rahen hai, yah aazamaane ke liye ki kya yah raashtra, yaa koi bhi raashtra, jo aise kalpit or aise samarpit ho, qaayam rah saktaa he
 We are standing on a great battlefield 2 of that war
 ham us bhoomi kaa ek ansh unki antim nidra ke liye arpit karne aaye hai jinhonen yahan apana jivan tyaagaa taaki raashtra jivit rahe
 This is fine and it is right that we do this today
 lekin, bade maayenon main, is zamin ko ham samarpit nahin kar sakate, ham pavitra nahin bana sakate, ham punya nahin tehra sakate
 Those brave men, living and dead, who have been battling here, have made it so sacred that we do not have the ability to do it more or less
 ham aaj yahan kya kehete hai, isaki duniya ko na zyaada parvaah hogi or na hi zyaada der use yaad rakhegi, lekin vah jo kar gaye use kabhi nahin bhula sakati
 Rather, we owe it to our lives to dedicate ourselves to the unfinished work that the fighters here carried forward so gracefully - to have a sense of dedication from the honored dead for the cause for which they had surrendered - It is determined here that those who die do not die in vain - that this nation, under God, will take a new birth of freedom - and the government that belongs to the people, to the people, to the people, 3 Or will not be busting

 Historically, data centers have previously transformed "SCSI disk tables into islands by directly connecting storage, each dedicated to an application and appearing as a number of 'virtual hard drives'" is
 multah, SAN aise sangrahan dwipon ko ek ucch gati network kaa upyog kar ke jodta he
 Operating systems create their own file systems using a dedicated - without sharing - LUNS as they do for themselves locally
 yadi ek se adhik system LUN ko share karne kaa prayaas karenge to ve ek duusare ke kaam main hastkshep karenge tathaa data kharaab kar denge
 Any scheme for sharing data between computers on the LUN requires an advanced solution such as a SAN file system or Clustered Computing / Computation
 in muddon ke baavjood, SAN sangrahan kshamta kaa upyog badhaane main madad karata he chunki ek se adhik sarwar apane nijee sangrahan sthaan ko discs saarini ke rup main ikaitha karte hai
 Common uses of SAN also include the provision of practical data that requires high-speed block level access to hard disks such as email servers, databases, and heavily used file servers
 SAN ke vipareet, network sanlagn sangrahan fil aadhaarit protocol jaise ki NFS yaa SMB / CIFS kaa prayog karata he jisame yah spasht he ki sangrahan remote sthaan par he or computer discs blaak ke bajaae fil kas ek hisse kaa anurodh karata he
 Recently, NAS heads have simplified the conversion of SAN storage to NAS
 h Despite the difference between NAS and SAN, it is possible to create solutions that incorporate both technologies, as shown in the figure

 SAN ek avadhi main dur sthaan par sthit duusari sangrahan saarini tak pahunch saktaa he
 This makes changes to the storage possible whether it is implemented by a disk table controller, server software, or specialized SAN tools
 Since IP WAN is the cheapest method for long-distance communication, IP and iscsi protocols were developed over Fiber Channel to extend SAN over IP networks
 paaramparik bhautik SCSI parat keval kuch hi meter kii duuri par kaam kar sakati thi jo ek aapadaa main kaarobaar barkaraar rakhane ke liye paryaapt nahin tha
 The demand for this SAN application has increased dramatically since the September 11 attacks in the United States, and the demand to create regulators involving Sarbanes Oxley and similar legislation is increasing rapidly

 Most storage networks use the SCSI protocol for communication between server and disk drive devices
 ve bhautik nimna str ke SCSI kaa prayog nahin karte, iske bajaae naye sangrahan network iscsi kaa prayog karte hai
 a mapping layer is used for other low level protocols to create a network: SAN aksar ek fibre channel fabric topology kaa upyog karata he - jo sangrahan sambandhit sanchaar ke liye ek vishesh rup se taiyaar kiya gaya buniyadi dhaancha he
 This provides faster and reliable access than the higher level protocols used in NAS

 SAN, being a network of large disk tables, is primarily used for storage operations in large-scale, high-performance enterprises
 SAN upkaran apekshaakrit mahangaa he or itane fibre channel host bas adapter desktop computer main durlabh hai
 There are expectations of eventually cheap SAN production through iscsi SAN technology, but it does not appear that this technology will be used outside of the enterprise data center
 Desktop customers are expected to continue using NAS protocols such as SMB and NFS

 a process in which logical storage is separated from physical storage is called storage virtualization

 Nearly two decades he became the busiest actor during this period, his films recorded so many, including the world record
 

 jiskaa arth he cinema ke adhikansh darshakon ne apni filmon ko pasand kiya, yahi vajah he ki film nirmaataaon ne aisi film kaa nirmaan kiya
 Why? 


 apparently for profit
 

 or agar yah munaafe vaala udhyam tha
 

 which means that his versatility and dynamic acting 


 is a healthy sign for debate so if there was such a bad influential stuff, it should have been exposed in Rahi's life
 


 So except for all the brown things we believe that we should respect the elections above that audience and all Sultan Rahi was not responsible for all of them
 


 The Urdu drama with the sound plot film had always remained his hidden desire, but he was an actor, so he acted and gave the best of whatever was asked antat sultan khan apni chhipi hui ichha se ghire hue the or apane junun ke liye lahore chale gaye or vah abhinay kar rahaa tha
 He came to Lahore with a lot of ambitions and dreams of a clothes and large army
 lahore railway stesan par landing karne ke baad, unhone malik studios ke peeche kaachi abaadi main ek kamare ko kiraye par liya pakistan ke sheersh abhinayta banegaa
 Former actor Badalji whoever came from Lalpurpur was very keen on acting and was able to enter films as an extra / fighter
 sultan or chengeji dost ban gaye or apane puure jivan main ve bahut achche dost bane rahe
 They both had bicycles and used to come to the studio on this cycle
 antat, chengeji ke madhyam se, ashfak malik kii film baagi main, jise 14 sitambar 1956 ko release kiya gaya tha, sultan khan ko bhi ek atirikt ke rup main filmon main mila
 Her first acting career in Bhagahi was a static and silent role as per the film's status, when Allaudin forced Yasmin to dance in front of the villagers for "moot Ko Dil De Do Sad a Dil", Sultan Khan was one of those dancing audiences
 Stood among the villagers
 yah shuruuaat thi or ek abhinayta kaa janm hua, jisane hatim, vathan, daku kii laarki aadi jaisi kai filmon main ek hi mook or sthir bhoomika nibhaai
 Finally it was 1960, the first time he gave some film dialogues for S
 em
 Yusuf's film Saheli which was produced under the banner of F&Y Movies
 saheli kii film kii sthiti ke anusaar unhone shaamim aara ke vakil ke taur par abhinay kiya, jise adaalat main abhiyukt ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha or court drishy main unhone apana pehla samvaad diya
 He addressed the judge and said jumma junj nal lagbhag chaudaa varsh biit chuke the lekin sultan raahi atirikt / senaanee se aage nahin bad paa rahe the, haalanki film chachaa ji film fere kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne main sakasham tha or film nirdeshak 1968 main, sultan raahi ko ant main riyaj ahamed raju kii punjabi film jumma junaj nal main ek khalanaayak bhoomika mili or aloudin kii sarvshereshth abhinay film ke baavjood acha pradarshan nahin kiya lekin usne ek manyata di sultan raahi ke liye or unki bhoomika or abhinay ko film gore ne pasand kiya tha
 After playing the role of a side villain in Jumma Junj Nal, Sultan Rahi started a five hundred innings instead of fifty rupees, so he got enough money to take care of himself and his family
 vah rawalpindi ke paas gaya, jahaan unke mata-pita ne unhen apane parivaar ke bheetar shaadi kar lee, kuch samay bitaane ke baad hi vah waapas laute lahore
 Here in Lahore, his wife brought a good fortune to him and he started playing important roles in films
 vah bahut mahatvakankshi or abhinay ke bare main kattarpanthi the, is ghatana se unki utsaah kalpana kar sakate hai, ek baar unhone apane parivaar ko lahore laane kaa faisla kiya, to unhone apane mitra ahamed mithu se kuch madad kaa anurodh kiya jo railway main ek air statis takanisian the mithu kuch railway free paas chalaate the lekin jab sultan raahi rawalpindi pahunch gaye to unhone sadak ke madhyam se lahore jane kaa faisla kiya, isliye unhone ek jeep ko kiraye par liya or lahore laut aayaa
 Upon his arrival he was very excited, so he asked his friend Mithu to leave his wife in his house and he went straight to the film studio as he was to perform against Mazhar Shah, who was a very popular villain at the time
 shooting ke baad film studio main unhone itnaa acha pradarshan kiya ki mazhar shah ne unhen gale lagaaya or sultan raahi ko bataaya ki "ab koi aapako ek sheersh varg ke abhinayta banane se roak nahin saktaa"
 In 1968, he first appeared as a traditional villain in Hairdar Chaudhary's film Badla
 badla kii rihaai ke baad, ucch pich par unka samvaad prasav, cheharaa abhivyakti or sharir ke ishaaron se unhen sambhavit khalanaayak sabit hua
 As a result, the producers began to cast him as the villain, his popular films Iq Si Ma, janab-e-ali, Jumma Junj Nal, Anwar, Et Khuda Da Veer, Duniya Matlab, Khan Chacha, Thah etc
 
 asalam daar ne cameraman ke rup main apana film karier shuru kiya tha or cinemetographer ke rup main apni vishwasaneeyata sthapit karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Looking for a camera lens, he exposed Sultan Rahi as an extra / fighter and noted how much his acting was and how happily he worked hard or impossible shots once he was with Raza Mir The assistant cameraman, he used to call Sultan Rahi the Pindi Vala fighter for any difficult shots
 ek baar jab unhone film nirdeshak daara ke rup main apni pehali film shuru kii to unhone nasarulla batt ke khilaaf film main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika ke liye sultan raahi ko lagaaya
 Dara performed well and some other film directors also chose Sultan Rahi
 duusari ore asalam daar ne apni nai pariyojna dil lagi shuru kii, jo puri tarah se ek saamaajik romantic film thi, phir unhone sultan raahi ko ek kirdaar bhoomika di lekin chunki yah ection filmon kii avadhi thi, film vitarakon ne suzav diya or maang kii ek ection film ke liye asalam daarato asalam daar dil kii laaji kii pariyojna ko pend karata he or ection film akhri chitan shuru kar detaa he, jo do bhai kii kahani thi, jo vibhaajan main alag ho jate hai, unamem se ek pakistan aate hai or duusare hindu hote hai jaise vah ugaaya jaataa he ek hindu parivaar main muslim or hindu paatro ko kramshah nasarulla batt or sultan raahi dwaara khelaa jaataa tha
 In Sree, Sultan Rahi played the role of the heroine's brother in Sakhi Lootera, Aslam Dar himself played the lead role, appointed as the real hero, refusing to perform that role and Sultan Rahi The role of his father who did very well in this film as the story of Mujahid, whose son betrays his companions
 sultan raahi ke film karier kaa aglaa mile kaa pathar ikbaal kashmiri ke babal tha jisamen unhone gangster kii bhoomika nibhaai thi jisane ek abhinayta ke rup main sultan raahi ko shradhanjali di
 Renowned choreographers Hameed Chaudhary and Sultan Rahi were friends of his struggling days
 donon hi open air theatre main manch naatakon ko khelte the, jahaan ve do saal tak kaam par rahe
 Once Hameed Chaudhary was voiced financially he produced his film Zindagi Ke Mele, this was Sultan Rahi's first Urdu film as a hero
 unhone Zamurad or aalia ke saath romantic nayak ke rup main bahut acha pradarshan kiya lekin garib disha kii film ke kaaran acchhee tarah se nahin kiya After Basira Milestone Sakshi Lutera, Aslam Dar started Muzrim with Zia Mohudin and also included Sultan Rahi as the brother of the film's heroine, but being a social film it proved to be a flop film
 ant main asalam parvaiz ne ek ection punjabi film banane kaa faisla kiya taaki usne bashira ke vichaar ko taiyaar kiya or sawan ko bashira ke rup main shaamil karne kaa prayaas kiya, jo safaltaapurvak khan chachaa ke baad praapt hui, lekin unke inkaar ke baad, asalam daar ko antim rup diya gaya sultan raahi ko apane sahyogiyon ke saath film ke nayak ke rup main lenaa tha, lekin is vichaar ko sunne ke baad ve sabhi sultan raahi ke nayak ke paksh main nahin the
 But Aslam Dar himself went to Samanabad where Sultan Rahi lived in those days to inform him that he had taken him as the hero of the film as per his promise
 aakhirkaar sabhi virodhiyon ke baavjood yah kaise shuru hua film ke puraa hone ke baad koi vitarak bashira ko relies karne ke liye taiyaar nahin tha, or bhi, bharat - pakistan yuddh 1971 shuru kiya gaya tha, isliye film ko dibbe main phenk diya gaya, jisase asalam daar ne vishesh rup se sultan raahi ko bahut niraash kiya
 Aslam Dar eventually decided to release the film himself, he hired Sunbok Cinema and released the film
 usee samay chah anya filmein bhi release huin, lekin film ke pehle sho ke baad sab log bashira ke bare main baat kar rahe the
 Sultan Rahi who took sixteen years to move from extras to a fighter and a hero of the film and that film curb at the box office and so did Sultan Rahi, making him the highest with the ups and downs of every day
 And was taken to a height and did not look back again
 icalbil kashmiri babal or asalam daar ke bashira kii safalataa ke baad sultan raahi kii vaastavik kahani shuru hui jab ek atirikt / senaanee bhaavnaatmak naaraaz vyakti ke pramukh abhinayta ban gaye apane sangharsh ke dinon ke dauraan sultan raahi ke andruni abhinayta dikhaai de rahe the lekin unke samarpan or abhinay ke prati samarpan se puri tarah se pataa nahin chalaa tha
 After the films, new dimensions of Sultan Rahi's acting and sentimental aspects were exposed and the doors of the film were opened for him, not stopping until his death
 tadnusaar, ve aisi filmon main mukhya rup se insaan ek tamaasha, jagdi rahanaa, khan chachaa, meley sajnaa de, nizaam, sultan ke mukhya abhinayta the
 , Ucha Shamla Jat da, Banari Thug
 Dharti Sheran Di, Ek Madaar, Khun Bode A, Khoon Da Dariya, Pahl Var, Pind Deleran Da, Sadhu and Shitan, Sona Babul, Zarak Khan, Babul Sadai Tere, Dil Lagi, Juram Te Nafrat, Sasta Khoon Mehanga Paan, Sidha Rasta , a Pag Mere Veer Di, Sharif Badmaash etc
 gave him a very strong platform
 uparokt filmon kii safalataa ke saath, sultan raahi kaa naam kisi bhi film kii safalataa kii guarantee ban gaya or vah swatantra rup se film ko swatantra rup se lene ke liye sakasham mana jaataa tha
 In, based on the story of Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi's novel, director Hassan Asakari directed a film Wehashi Jatt, in which he portrayed Sultan Rahi as an uneducated, desolate and wildly angry man who avenge his lack of this
 The character kept the general public clicking for the rest of his life, so that Sultan Rahi would roam around in what it called a Gandasa culture
 The fundamental criterion of the character that attracted the attention of Kiti was that he used to appease her as it was her own story of the underprivileged and then as a retaliation for her breakout Yusuf Khan and Mustafa Qureshi were not only the leading actors of the time , Rather he was Rahi's senior and his presence to keep a place with him was not an easy task
 vehashi jatt kii rihaai ke baad, sultan raahi ne mustafa kuraishi ke saath shareef baadmaash or jaabaru main yusuf khan ke saath bhi kaam kiya, sultan raahi license main upasthit hue
 In these films Sultan Rahi gave a very dynamic performance and placed the flag of the films as the main protagonist
 haalanki, yusuf khan or kaa abhinay maanak nishaan par tha lekin aane vaale filmon ke lekhak ne sultan raahi kii style or abhinay ke pradarshan ko dekhte hue kathaayen likhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 On the other hand Mustafa Qureshi had his own unique style, as a result, the role of Mustafa Qureshi's versatile villain became a necessity for all Punjabi films with Sultan Rahi
 maula jat ke rup main apekshit, nirmaataa gandasa samskruti filmon ke nakshekadam par chalanaa shuru kar diya tha or samay pehle aayaa tha ki aisi filmon kii filmon ke saath aam film bachi hui thi, mohammad sarwar bhatti younis malik ko ek aisi kahani par aadhaarit duusari film nirdeshit karne ke liye kaam par rakhaa, jo prasiddh film lekhak nasir adib dwaara likhi gai thi or iskaa naam mullah jat tha
 Unlike Vihashi Jatt, Sultan Rahi's role was not solely a wildly uneducated human killer machine but was shown to be a simple mediator who would take up arms for the implementation of justice
 maula jat ne 1979 main relies kiya or sabhi samay kaa sarvshereshth film sabit hui
 Nasir Adeeb's best, timely and erythematic dialogue and his delivery by all the actors especially like Mustafa Qureshi, Chakomori and Kaifi and how to forget the famous dialogue of Sultan Rahi's "mouli New Maula Na Mere Te Maula Na Mar Da" The performance of Can and all the actors made this film a history and led to the release of Maula Jat
 apane jivan main sultan raahi ko ek jivit katha banaaya mullah jatt ke bare main vivaran sultan raahi ke film-o-graphy main varnit hai
 Particularly Punjabi films were changed with the release of the genre and trend of films, Maula Jatt
 romantikatawaad, kalatmak rup se taiyaar kii gai filmein or paramparaagat naatak unmukh filmon kaa badla badla or thodaa hinsak filmon main sthanantarit kiya gaya
 Since Sultan Rahi was able to create his masculine image, which is always his righteousness, dignity and perseverance, the producers and filmmakers raised the point that cinema viewers are only interested in Sultan Rahi's presence in the film

 But during this period many good films were also made which were very good business and these included Sultan Rahi who made several film records after the success of Maula Jat and committed till his death in 1996, Sultan Rahi's film-o- Details are given on the graphy page

 budhaape ke logon ne suna he ki lahore ke itihaas main yah gaji ilamdin shahid ke baad sabase badi antyeshti juluus tha
 Since Sultan Rahi had a very passionate attachment with the Sufi saint Shah Shamas Qurari, he often visited his temple in his life

 Geoffrey Chaser was an English-language poet, writer, philosopher and diplomat
 unke saath hi angreji sahitya main aadhunik yug kaa prarambh mana jaataa he
 'canterbury Tales' is his famous creation
 unki rachanaayen sahitya ke atirikt jivan ke vyapak kshetra main nae mode kaa sanket karti hai
 John Dryden has called him the 'father of English poetry'
 chasar kaa janm landan main san 1340 i
 ke lagbhag hua tha
 The father was a liquor merchant
 17 varsh kii avasthaa main inhone england ke raja edward tritiy ke putr alster ke arl ke parivaar main naukari kar lee
 Thus he got an opportunity to get a good knowledge of the modalities of the court, which he used in his poetry
 rajpariwaar kii naukari ne inaki saahitiyik pratibha ke vikaas ke kuch or bhi avasar die
 Two years later he had to travel to France in connection with the Centennial War where he spent a few days in captivity of the French enemies
 yah yatra inke saahitiyik jivan main badi hi mahatvapurn siddh hui
 Despite the faults of artificiality in French poetry of this time, it also had the qualities of beauty and artistry
 chasar ne apana saahitiyik jivan tatkaaleen francisi kavita ko vyapak rup se prabhavit karne vaali rachana 'romaa de laa roj' ke anuwaad se kiya
 The indelible influence of French poetry, and especially of this poem, is not only on his early works, but also on the 'canterbury Tales', the final and best work that presents a realistic picture of life
 rajdurbar main chasar ko apni kaarykushalta ke falswaroop paryaapt khyaati praapt ho chuki thi
 Around 1372 AD, he was sent to Italy for some important business consultations
 chha: saal baad inhone italy kii duusari baar yatra kii
 a trip to Italy gave a new twist to his literary life
 isi ke falswaroop ye francisi prabhaav se mukt ho sake
 Now the sources of his inspiration were Dante, Petrarch and Boccacio, the famous poets and storytellers of Italy
 inpar sabase adhi prabhaav bokeshio kaa padaa
 Chaser took the sad story of 'trials and Cressed' from Bokeshio
 chasar kii antim or sarvottam rachana cantarbari tels main ham unke swatantra vyaktitv kii abhivyakti pate hai
 By the time of the creation of this book, he had fully absorbed French and Italian literary influences
 cantarbari tels main chasar kisi videshi saahitiyik style kaa anusaran na kar jivan ke apane anubhav tathaa vyapak adhyayan ke aadhaar par moulik rachana prastut karte hai
 He has generally written in a sarcastic manner regarding women and married life
 sambhav he aisa inhone keval vinod ke liye kiya ho
 His wife's name was Philippa
 san 1400 i
 main chasar kii mrityu hui
 Some important events took place during the lifetime of Chasur
 sabase mahatvapurn england or france ke bich lagbhag sau varsh tak chalanevaala yuddh hi tha jisamen inhone swayan bhaag liya tha
 But this poem neither mentions this war nor expresses maliciousness against enemies
 isi samay kisaanon kaa vidroh tathaa vinaashkari plig jaisi aitihaasik mahatv kii ghatnaayen hui
 But there is no mention of them in his compositions
 phir bhi cantarbari tels main na keval england ke tatkaaleen saamaajik jivan kii, europea jivan main ho rahe mahatvapurn parivartanon kii spasht jhalak dekhne ko milti he
 By this time, public attention was being paid to the corruption prevalent in the Church of Rome
 yatratatra padariyon kii charitrik trutiyaan kii khari aalochana bhi hone lagi thi
 This was a symptom of the great change in European ideology widely influenced by religion which we also see in the Canterbury Tales
 saath hi saath logon kaa dhyaan ab parloukik baton se hatakar bhautik jagat kii samasyaon tathaa dainik jivan ke sukh du:kha kii ore jane laga
 This important trend of European biography is also reflected in the Canterbury Tales and other works of Chaser
 madhyayugin sahitya adhikanshat: kalpanapradhan tha yaa aadhyatm tathaa naitikta kii shiksha dene kaa madhyam maatr
 Chaser gave him an independent existence free from the urges of class and morality
 sahitya rachana main unka uddeshy pradhanat: jivan ke prati apni vyaktigat anubhatiyon kii manoranjak abhivyakti tha
 All these characteristics of Chaser's literature are seen with full blossom in Elizabethan carpet literature almost two hundred years later
 is prakaar ham unhen europea punarjagran kaa aadya angreji kavi kah sakate hai
 As has been said, Chaser started his literary life with a translation of 'romain de la Rose'
 roopak shailo main prem kii vyakhya prastut karanevaala vah kavy bhinn hi nahin apitu paraspar virdohi prakruti ke do francisi kaviyon kii kriti he
 In a dream, a lover tries to pluck the flower of love in a beautiful garden
 praarambhik bhaag prem kaa bada hi shisht, sundar evam prabhavotpadak chitra prastut karata he lekin badwaale bhaag main duusare kaviyon ne striyon tathaa prem ke varnan main dhyangyatmak style apanaai he
 In many of Chaser's compositions, we see the influence of French poetry
 'book aanv dachez' 'house ov fame' tathaa 'parlment ov foules' roopak style main hai
 The events described in the three seem to be seen in a dream
 book ov daches tathaa parlment ov foules main kavi darbari parampara ke anusaar prem kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 We also find such an ideal depiction of love in Ron de la Rose
 'tryles and cracid' kii kahani bokeshio se lee hui he
 This grief confirms the Italian influence over the poetic chaser
 trialas niraash premi he jisaki premika cracid usase alag ho jane par ek anya purush kaa varan kar leti he
 Chaser composed 'legend of Good Women' as she herself stated in the preface, on the queen's complaint that she had 'accused the entire female race of being unreliable by Cressid's character
 is adhuri pusatak main lagbhag das aitihaasik tathaa puranic khyatipraapt naariyon kaa prashansaatmak jeevanavrittant he
 Chaser's final and best composition is 'canterbury Tales'
 angreji samaaj ke vibhinn staron tathaa peshon kaa pratinidhitiv karanevaale lagbhag tees tirthayatri jo cantarbari nagar main tamas baket kii samadhi par apni shradhanjali arpit karne janevaale hai ek sarai main ikattha hote hai
 With the idea that the road should not be tired and be entertained, it is decided at the suggestion of the lord of the inn that every traveler should tell four stories while leaving and two return times
 jisaki kahaniyaan bahumat dwaara sarvottam samajhi jaaen, use sab log milakar usee sarai main acchhee daavat den
 The stories of 'canterbury' are derived from the entire European anecdote literature, not Chaser's own work
 uski melikata yatriyon ke charitra ke sookshm adhyayan main dekhne ko milti he
 Chasar, through his thirty-one passers, with a high degree of characterization in characterization, has also achieved laudable success in presenting a comprehensive portrait of the erstwhile British society
 cantarbari tels main hamen yug ke saamaajik jivan kii jhaanki milti he
 Another feature of Chasar is his unflinching humor
 yahan vah maanavcharitra kii choti badi kamajoriyon par hansataa he, vahiin use manushya maatr se, uski sari trutiyon ke baavjood apaar sahanubhuti bhi he
 For these reasons, his literature remains healthy and even today, a source of renewable inspiration
