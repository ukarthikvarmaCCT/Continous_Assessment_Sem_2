 Regarding the establishment of Dudhleshwar, it is said that Barsa Wada, the present-day Todgarh resident, Khangar Ji was a man of Malawat Bhakti Bhakta and grazing cows in the forest
 ek din jangal main khangaar ji ko sadhu vesh dhari ek sanyasi mili jinhone khangaar ji se jal laane hetu kaha or kheer banaakar khaane kii ichha vyakt kii
 When Khangar saw the container of the water kept with him, the water was exhausted in it, so he asked for permission from the monk to bring water from the well a kilometer away
 Asked to uproot a bunch, Khangar ji uprooted a bunch of grass told by the monk, then the water stream burst from there and he thought that this monk is not an ordinary monk Lki can be very wondrous Mahatma Dewadidev Mahadev be Awatrit the Ganga who hill
 khangaar ji ne sadhu mahatma ko shradha purvak naman kar jal pilaayaa or unke darshan se abhibhut ho gayi jal pine ke baad sadhu mahatma ne khangaar jiji se kaha ki doodh lekar aao kheer banaakar khaangen
 When Khangar ji started going to a milking cow to fetch milk, the sadhu said that there is no need to go so far, stop it
 Whatever the first cow came to drink the water collected from this flowing water stream, its milk was released
 to take
 khangaar ji ne sadhu se kaha ki maharaj yah to togdi he iske doodh kahaan se hoga
 Mahatma said you will come out with milk
 khangaar ji ne vaisaa hi kiya or mahatma ke chamatkaar se ek bin vyaahi gaay ke thano se doodh aa gaya

 Whose sage took the steam and he went ahead and gave a rice grain and dagchi to Khangar ji and said that make Kheer, now Khangar ji is quite confident that he will stand in front of the interviewed Mahaveda and by his command It is useless to ask why a rice grain made from Kheer, Khangar ji made Kheer with great enthusiasm like Mahatma ji Khangar ji and others Sector gap fill was not yet finished pudding that was a miracle
 ek chaaval ke dane kii kheer itane logo ke khane ke baavjood bhi khatm nahi hui kheer khaane ke baad mahatma ji vahaan se jane lage to khangaar ji ne unase arshivaad liya or mahatma ji ne unase kuch maagane ko kaha to khangaar ji ne unase vah degchi maang lee jise mahatma ji unhe de di
 It is said that even today, Daigchi Khangar ji is present near the people of Malawat, thus the name of the place was Dudhleshwar due to the incident of milking by Khangar ji and later on the date where Ganga descended, a small Kui was made and Khangar The temple of Mahadevji was built in 1651 by G

 Madrak is a Jat gotra
 aldihidon tathaa kitonon par hydroxil-amin kii pratikriya se jo yogic praapt hote hai unhen oxim kehete hai
 Compounds made of aldihado are called aldoxim and compounds made from ketones are called insectoxim
 inke sutara saamne ke chitra main darshaae gayi hai
 Oximes are chemical compounds whose general formula is R1R2C = NOH in which R1 is an organic chain and R2 is either hydrogen that forms aldaxime or another organic group that forms ketoxime
 sabase pehla oxim victor meyar ne san 1878 i
 main banaaya tha
 Subsequently, due to the importance of oxides in aldehydes and ketones, and the importance of oximes in their detection, and the configurability of these compounds, chemists showed special interest in their studies, which led to many important research related to them
 aldihidon tathaa kitonon ke shuddhikaran tathaa pahchaan main inke upyog kaa vishesh kaaran yah he ki oxim thos avasthaa main manibhiya tathaa jal main aviley hote hai; at: inako shuddh avasthaa main praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Heating with hydrochloric or sulfuric acid solutions results in hydrolysis of oximes
 iske falswaroop aldihide yaa kitone swatantra avasthaa main pun: praapt ho jate hai
 Reduced amino acids are the primary amino acids, thus they are used to convert C-OCO-C-NH
 aldoxim acid chloride dwaara nirjalit kiye ja sakate hai jisase kuch oxim, dhatviya tatwon ke saath sanyukt hokar, sthaayee savarg yogic banaate hai
 The solubility of compounds formed in this way differs from each other due to the similar properties and related diverse elements
 is kaaran, vaishleshik rasayan main, in oxymon kaa bada mahatv he
 Salicyl Aldaxim makes this type of compound from many metals, but all compounds made from other metals are soluble in dilute acetic acid, except compounds made with copper
 taanbe ke saath bana yogic haritabh-pit rang kaa ek churna sa hota he or ise 110° sein
 par sukhaakar sthaayee rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, Ifemem has suggested to use this Oxim for the separation and elimination of copper from other elements
 isi prakaar diamethil glaiksim, jo diketone-daai-acittle kaa daai-oxim he, anek dhaatuon ke saath sankeern yogic banaata he, jinamein se keval nikal tathaa paladium se bane yogic tanu amlon tathaa tanu kshar vilyanon main aviley hote hai
 Therefore, this oxim is used a lot in the measurement of nickel and palladium and completely separating nickel from cobalt
 beta napthoquinon kaa ek oxim cobalt ke saath isi prakaar kaa aviley yogic banaata he, jisase cobalt ke parimaapan main iskaa upyog hota he
 The importance of oxymes in the development of configurational chemistry is no less
 san 1883 i
 main hanse goldsmit ne gyaat kiya ki benzil kaa dwi-oxim do roopon main paaya jaataa he, phir san 1889 i
 main victor meyar ne ek teesraa rup bhi gyaat kiya
 In the same year, Beckman reported that benzaldehyde is also found in two forms
 waant hof ne >C = CC = N- vaale yogicon main lagaakar yah dikhalaya ki oxymon ke samavyav jyamitiya samavyav hai
 According to him, oxides of aldehydes and asymmetric ketones can be found in two forms, which can be written as follows: yah samavyawata thik usee prakaar kii he jaisi mailic amla tathaa fumeric amla kii >C = C< par
 In ketones, this is only possible in asymmetric ketones, as there is no difference between these two forms once R1 and R2 unite
 iske aadhaar par benzil dwi-oxim ke rup bhi likhe ja sakate hai
 The reaction of water on the substance obtained by reacting ether of ketones with phosphorus pentaoxide in the ether gives substituted acid-amides
 is kriya ko bekaman punarvinyas kehete hai
 The roots change in this verb
 jo mulak pehle carbon ke saath sanyukt tha, ab vah nitrogen ke saath sanyukt mulak se sthanantaran kar letaa he
 The formation of these substances as a result of the Beckman transformation confirms that the composition of the isobes is the same, but its isomerism is due to its different location at the base of the roots

 The Dr
 George Grierson Award is given by the Kendriya Hindi Sansthan to a well-known foreigner for his Hindi services
 ise 1994 main prarambh kiya gaya tha
 The major Hindi scholars who have received it so far are as follows- nrity aadi ke nimitt sharir ke vibhinn angon ke sanchaalan ke kram evam rup ke dizin ko nrityrachana yaa koreography kehete hai
 The person, dancer or performer who performs this work is called a 'choreographer' or 'choreographer' or choreographer
 nrity kaa itihaas utana hi pracheen he jitna maanav jivan kaa itihaas
 Occasions of joy in the daily activities of human life gave rise to folk dances
 ye lokanrity hameshaa samoohon main hi kiye jate the
 The operation of these dances used to be very simple
 adhikansh nrityon main log ek gol gheraa banaakar simit ang sanchaalan se apane manobhaavon ko prakat karte hue thirakate the
 These dances were so easy and simple that even a spectator would join them in dancing with them
 kehane kaa aashay yah he ki is prakaar ke nrityon kii sanrachana atyadhik saral thi
 Talking about Indian classical dances, except for Kathak, Odissi and Bharatanatyam, all other dances used to fall under the category of 'nrityanatya' in their initial form
 nrity natya hone se in ke pradarshan main samooh kaa pradarshan hota hoga tathaapi samooh sanrachana ke kaushal par us samay itnaa jor nahin diya jaataa tha
 Like the eastern countries, we also have a rich tradition of their dance in the countries of the west
 ‘koreography‘ kii kala pashchimi deshon main bahuprachlit he
 The art of group formation has also been in our dances and we get to know about it in the medieval texts as 'group bond'
 acharya bharat ne apane naatyashaastra main bhi jis ‘pindi bandh‘ kaa ullekh kiya he - vah samooh kii sanrachana se hi sambaddh rakhata he
 In Indian classical dance, the philosophy of dance, drama and dance of dance can be varied in different ways
 nrity bana he natya va nritt se milakar or is nrity kaa vikaas keval bhartiya nrityon main hi dekha ja saktaa he
 The dance is performed when the lyrics and the rhythmic movements of the hands and feet match the favorable sentiments of the words, and this dance not only enchants the audience like the dances of Western countries, but also touches their souls
 is
 isiliye bhartiya nrityon ne jabase koreography kii kala ko aatmsaat kiya he tab se unamem ek nayaa aakarshan paidaa ho gaya he
 Indian dances not only have thematic diversity but costumes also have a variety of colors
 atah samooh sanrachana ke kaushal se inke prabhaav main kai guna vruddhi ho jaati he
 a simple choreography can also be made attractive by choreography
 nrity sangyojan karte samay koreographer prashikshit nartako ke samooh ko asankhya tareekon se sanyojit kar aseemit akritiyon kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 In the tradition of Kathak dance, these figures are known as 'arrah Rachna'
 ekal nrity pradarshan main in vyuh rachanaaon ko chalanon ke madhyam se prastut kiya ja saktaa tha
 The beauty of these creations in the group is doubled
 samooh main prastut kii jane vaali kuch akritiyaan nimnanusaar he
 The effort to keep up with the changing interest of the audience in today's electronic age has given the choreography even more detail
 kisi ek nrity rachana ko ek akele nartak ke sthaan par yadi 6 yaa 8 nartako kaa samooh pradarshit karata he to usamen sthit vibhinnata, vividhta, or naye-naye kai aakaaron main nartakon kaa sangyojan darshako ko nishchit hi zyada aakarshith karenge
 By dividing the larger group into two or three smaller groups, sometimes a straight long straight line, sometimes by connecting the dancers in the slant line, sometimes making a big circle inside it, sometimes keeping some dancers steady and some moving, sometimes a c
 By keeping the same limb movement in motion and rhythm, a variety of beautiful and attractive scenes of various types can be planned
 aaj manch kaa swaroop bhi puri tarah badal chukaa he
 Large auditoriums equipped with modern technology, diversified lighting scheme, sound system etc
 have also changed the technique of dance performance
 yah parivartan aprihaary bhi he
 a single dancer on a large stage does not produce as much effect as a group of dancers
 ek saath kai haathon kaa uthanaa va girnaa, bhramariyon kaa prayog, ek si veshbhusha tadnurup prakaash va dhwani sangyojan darshako ko sammohan kii sthiti tak le jane main samarth he
 The choreographer or dance coordinator, whether solo dance or group, is the most important figure in the history of dance to find harmony with the dancers' actions and their interactions
 kathanak, nartako kii veshbhusha, uplabdh manchi saadhan va nartako ko vibhinn sthitiyon va roopon main sanyojit kar nrity takanic ko vistaar pradaan karata he
 a good choreographer must have a good grasp of choreography as well as a sense of beauty in it
 nrity, drishyakala he, atah isamen veshbhusha, rupasajja, manchi prabhaav ke prayek saadhan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 a skilled choreographer can create miraculous effects in dance composition by using and performing all these with his creative talent
 badlaav ke is yug main koreography kii kala main bhi vistaar hua he
 Saying more in less time is a challenging task to make the stage available to a large number of dancers, adjust the stage size to a larger dancer group, and entertain the audience while maintaining diversity
 aaj badalte manch kii takanic, veshbhusha, dhwani-prakaash yojana, sets aadi ne koreographer ke samaksh koreography ke liye ek khulaa aasmaan uplabdh kara diya he, jahaan vah apni kalpana ko manachaahi udaan de saktaa hai
 David Hume was a world-renowned philosopher of modern times
 ve scotland ke nivasee the
 Your main texts are - 'an examination of human wisdom' and 'an examination of moral principles'
 hum kaa darshan anubhav kii prishthbhumi main parmotkrisht he
 According to you this experience is the only experience that is real
 anubhav ke atirikt koi bhi gyaan sarvopari nahin he
 No knowledge arises from wisdom
 buddhi ke sahare manushya anubhav se praapt vishyon kaa mishran evam vichchhedan karata he
 This knowledge does not increase new knowledge
 pratyakshanubhoot vastuon main sambandh hote hai, jo teen prakaar ke hai - saadrishy sannikarsh tathaa kaaranta
 Recalling from one object to another on the basis of similarity, recalling the horse from the horse due to proximity and considering the sun as the cause of light are examples of these different relationships
 uparyukt teen sambandhon main kaaranta sambandh ne darshanikon kaa dhyaan adhik aakrisht kiya
 In relation to 'causality' Hume's view that accusing 'causality' is futile
 kaaran or kaary kaa sambandh vaastavik nahin he
 In the external world, we see two events happening simultaneously
 aisa sadaiv hone kii anubhuti ke aadhaar par ham ek ko kaary or duusare ko kaaran samaj lete hai
 Light is always received by the sun shining, of course; But how can one be called cause and the other act? Actually no 'causal relationship' is experienced between the two
 isiilie hum ke matanusaar kaary purnataya kaaran se bhinn he or unhen ek ko duusare main sannihit samajhnaa morrkhtaa he
 'nature symmetry' and 'causality' originate from a psychological background
 duusare shabdon main yon kahen ki inkaa bhavapaksh hi pradhan he, vishaypaksh nahin
 It is illusory to have faith in matter like 'causality'
 kisi bhi vastu main vibhinn gunon ke atirikt or kuch bhi nahin he
 'these qualities are in some' shelter ',' it is not fair to think so
 is prakaar ke 'aashray' kaa gyaan anubhav ke pare he
 If other properties are removed one by one from an object, then nothingness remains in the end
 at: dravya kaa astitv dantakatha maatr he
 Thus in Hume's view, similar to 'causality', there is a subjective practice of believing in matter, which is made thematic by illusion
 bhautik dravya kii bhanti hi hum maansik dravya ko bhi nahin maanate
 According to him the soul or mind is nothing but the integration of experiences
 man ek rangamanch maatr hi he jahaan bhav, vichaar, anubhav ityadi maansik vyavasthaayen nrity karti dikhaai detii hai; parantu vah man bhi swat: anubhav se pare rahata he
 The 'shelter' of these mental thoughts is mind or soul, this is not confirmed by experience at all
 dharm ke sambandh main hum kii dharna he ki isaki utpatti manushya kii aadhyatmik prishthbhumi se nahin balki bhautik parivesh se hoti he
 Its basis is sensation, not emotion
 maanavswabhaav dharm kaa utprerak avashya he, par vah swabhaav buddhi par aadhaarit nahin he, anubhav se poshit he
 This nature is not governed by mental thoughts, controlled by fear and physical pleasure
 yah aashaa or utsukata hi he jo adrishy shakti main aasthaa utpann karti he or usase bhavishya main mangal hone kii kaamana ko janm detii he
 Just like the notion of religion, Hume also denied the experienced God
 praakrit vastuon ko dekhakar unke kaaran kii jigyaasa swaabhaavik he
 But to consider the world as a work and to accept God as its reason is beyond experience
 vastav main kaaryakaaran-bhav tathaa uske dwaara ishwar main aasthaa kaa bodh swaabhaavik nahin he
 Surely we can neither know nor prove that which is beyond experience
 yah sahi he ki hum ne ishwar ke astitv main avishvaas nahin kiya, parantu ve ant tak kehete rahe ki uskaa gyaan sambhav nahin he
 In this way, Hume proved himself to be a reasonable skeptic in the field of philosophy
 bharat sevak samaaj bharat sarkaar ke yojana ayog dwaara pryojit vikaas sanstha he
 It was established in 1951 by the Planning Commission for obtaining public assistance, on 12 August 1952 as per the recommendations of the National Advisory Committee

 The theory of computing or computer theory is a branch of computer science and mathematics that looks at whether and how efficiently a problem can be solved on a model of computing using an algorithm
 is kshetra ko do pramukh shakhaon main vibhajit kiya gaya he: abhiklanaatmak siddhant or jatilta siddhant, lekin donon shakhaaen abhikalan ke aupchaarik model kii charchaa karatin hai
 To make a more in-depth study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstracting of computers called a model of computation
 kai model upyog main hai, lekin sabase adhik jaanch kiya jane vaala he turing mashin
 ek turing mashin ko ek desktop PC ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he jisamen sambhavit rup se ek anant smriti kshamta hoti he, yadhyapi vah, is smriti kaa upyog keval choti asatat maatra main kar saktaa he
 Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is easy to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results and because it represents a model that many consider to be the most powerful possible computation
 " Appropriate "model
 aisa lag saktaa he ki sakasham anant smriti kshamta ek aprapya visheshta he, lekin turing mashin dwaara hal koi bhi nirdharaniya samasya ko hameshaa keval ek parimit raashi kii smriti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 So in theory, any problem that can be solved by a Turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a fixed amount of memory
 abhikalan ke siddhant ko, computer vigyaan ke kshetra main sabhi prakaar ke modelon ke nirmaan ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he
 Hence mathematics and logic are used
 pichhali sadi main yah ek swatantra shaikshanik vishay ban gaya or ganit se alag ho gaya
 Some of the pioneers of computation theory were Alonzo Church, Alan Turing, Stephen Klein, John von Neumann, Claude Schenn and Noam Chomsky
 computebility siddhant, mukhya rup se us seemaa ke sawaal kii charchaa karata he jis seemaa tak ek samasya ko ek computer par hal kiya ja saktaa he
 The statement that a halting problem cannot be solved by a Turing machine is one of the most important results in computability theory, as it is an example of a concrete problem that is easy to formulate and solve using a Turing machine Is impossible
 computebility siddhant kaa adhikansh hissaa holting samasya ke parinaam par banataa he
 Another important step in computability theory is the Rice theorem, which states that for all non-trivial properties of partial verbs it is undetermined whether a Turing machine calculates a fractional action with that property
 computebility siddhant, ganitiya tark kii shakha, jise rikrshan siddhant kaha jaataa he, se nikat rup se sambandhit he, jo us pratibandh ko hataata he jiske tahat abhikalan ke sirf un modelon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jinhen turing mashin ke yogya kiya ja saktaa he
 Many mathematicians and computation theorists who study recursion theory will refer to it as computability theory
 jatilta siddhant sirf yah nahin dekhtaa he ki kya ek samasya computer par hal kii ja sakati he, balki yah bhi dekhtaa he ki yah samasya kitni kushaltapurvak hal kii ja sakati he
 Two major aspects are considered: time complexity and space complexity, which respectively means how many steps it takes to edit a computation and how much memory is required to edit that computation
 yah vishleshan karne main ki ek die gaye elgorithm ko kitne samay or spes kii aavashyaktaa he, computer vaigyanik us samasya ko hal karne ke liye aavashyak samay or spes ko input samasya ke aakaar ke falan ke rup main vyakt karte hai
 For example, finding a particular number in a long list of numbers becomes harder as the list of numbers becomes taller
 agar ham kehete hai ki suchi main n { \ displaystyle n} sankhya he or yadi suchi ko kisi bhi tarah se hal yaa anukramit nahin kiya gaya he to hamen apni icchit sankhya ko khojane ke liye prayek sankhya ko dekhnaa pad saktaa he
 Thus we can say that to solve this problem, the computer will need to perform several steps that increase linearly in the size of the problem
 is samasya ko saral banane ke liye, computer vaigyanikon ne Big o notesan ko apanaaya he, jo kaaryon kii is tarah se tulana karne kii anumati detaa he jo yah sunishchit karata he ki mashin ke nirmaanon ke kuch vishesh pahaluon par vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, balki keval acemptotic vyavhaar ko dekhnaa hota he jab samasyaayein badi ho jaati hai
 So in our previous example, we can say that o { \ displaystyle O} steps are required to solve this problem
 shaayad sampoorn computer vigyaan main sabase mahatvapurn mukt samasya, is sawaal par he ki kya NP chihnit samasyaon kaa ek nishchit vyapak varg kushaltapurvak hal kiya ja saktaa he ki nahin
 This is discussed later in the complexity classes p and NP
 turing mashin ke alaava, anya samakaksh abhikalan model kaa upyog kiya jaataa hai
 In addition to general computation models, some simple computation models are useful for specialized, finite applications
 regular expressant, udhaaharan ke liye, karyaalay utpaadakta software se lekar programing bhashaa tak, kai sandarbhon main string pattern ko nirdisht karte hai
 Another formalism that is mathematically equivalent to regular expressions is finite automata that are used in circuit design and in some types of problem solving
 sandarbh mukt vyakaran, programing bhashaa ke vaakya vinyas ko nirdisht karte hai
 Non-deterministic pushdown automata are another formalism equivalent to context-free grammars
 primitive punaravarti kriya, punaravarti kriyaaon kaa ek paribhaashit upvarg he
 Different models of computing have different functions

 Extensive investigation of the elements that constitute computation theory may include formal semantics and mathematical reasoning and may also include theoretical aspects of certain topics such as parallel computation, neural networks, and quantum computation

 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main, bluez rock naamak ek sankar rup ubhara
 The term "blues" refers to "blues devils", which means sadness and sadness; The initial use of the word in this sense was found in George Coleman's comic unit Blue Devils

 This phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood in a song
 20veen sadi ke pehle dashak ke dauraan, bluez sangeet ko swarsanghat anukram ke sandarbh main spasht rup se paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya tha
 By the early 1900s, twelve-bar Blues became the standard due to the commercial success of the african-american community of first blues star singers such as Basie Smith
 anya swarsanghat anukram, jaise ki 8-baar swaroop ko abhi bhi bluez mana jaataa he; udaahranon main shaamil hai "haau long bluez", "trubal in mind" or big bill brunzi kaa "kii tu da haive"
 re charles ke vaadya-sangeet "sweet 16 bars" or harbi hancock ke "watermelan main" ke samaan 16-baar bluez bhi maujuud hai
 Similar to the 9-bar chorus of "sitting on Top of the World" by Howlin Woolf, individual specific numbers of bars are also occasionally encountered
 bluez sangeet-rachana ke buniyadi tvilv-baar geet kaa dhaancha 4 / 4 time signechar main tvilv baar ke maanak hormonic swarkram se parilakshith hota he
 The blues vocalization associated with the twelve-bar Blues is usually a set of three separate chords played on the twelve-bar scheme
 aaroh-avaroh ke sopan ko nirdisht karte hue un par roman ank ke label chipke hote hai
 For example, for the blues on the key of C, c is the tonal cord and f is suboptimal
 antim cord prabhavi prativartan he, jo agle swarkram kii shuruuaat ke parivartan ko ankit karata he
 The songs usually end on the last beat of the tenth time or the first beat of the eleventh time, and the last two times are given to the player as a break; The symmetry, alternation of this two-bar break can be very complex
 or kabhi-kabhi ekal note se yukt hota he jo cord kii drushti se vishleshan kii avhelnaa karte hai
 On many occasions, some or all of these chords are played in harmonic seventh form
 hormonic seventh ke antaraal kaa upyog bluez kii visheshta he or ise aam taur par "bluez seven" kaha jaataa he
 The blues seven cord adds a note to the harmonic cord with a frequency of 7: 4 ratio of the basic note
 7:4 anupaat par, vah paaramparik western daiatonic scale par kisi antaraal ke sameep nahin he
 Often it reaches the Minor Seventh Interval or Dominant Seventh Chord for convenience or as needed
 dhun main, bluez ko sambhddha major scale ke mand third, fifth or seventh ke upyog dwaara pahachaanaa jaataa he
 These special notes are called blue or bent notes
 ye scale tone swaabhaavik scale tone kii jagah le sakate hai, yaa unhen scale main joda ja saktaa he, jaisaa ki miner bluez scale ke maamle main hota he, jisamen flat third natural third kii jagah letaa he, flats seventh natural seventh kii jagah letaa he or flats pancham ko natural forth or natural fifth ke bich main joda jaataa he
 While the twelve-bar harmonic rhetoric has been used recurrently for centuries, the revolutionary aspect of the blues is similar to the use of grace notes in tune, crushing flat third, flat seventh, and flat fifth again and again - bringing adjacent notes straight to the same Playing in time - and use with sliding
 blue nots swarkram, swaranukram ke dauraan abhivyakti ke mukhya kshan or bluez ke alankaran ko anumat karte hai
 Blues shuffle or walking bass enhance the rhythm and call-and-response like introspection and create a frequency-like effect called grooves
 swing music main shafal kii kendriya bhoomika, africa-america mul ke samay se bluez kii visheshta rahi he
 The simplest shuffles, which were a clear identity of the R&B wave starting in the mid-1940s, were three-note riffs on the guitar's base strings

 shafal lay ko aksar "dou, da dou, da dou, da" yaa "damp, da damp, da damp, da" ke rup main swar diya jaataa, jisamen asmaan yaa "jhuumane vaale" aath nots hote hai
 On the guitar it can be played as a normal fixed base, or it can add a fifth to sixth of the cord and a notch quarter note in return
 nimnlikhit guitar sarinibaddh suchi main e main bluez swarkram kaa pratham for-baar uplabdh karaayaa gaya he: The lyrics of traditional blues songs are often repeated four times in a row; It became the most common current structure standard only after the first decade of the 20th century: the so-called AAB pattern, which included the line being sung on four first bars, repeating it on the next four and then the long closing line on the last
 The two previously published blues songs, "dallas Blues" and "st
 Louis Blues", featured 12-time blues with the AAB structure
 WC Handy wrote that he adopted this tradition three times to avoid the monotony of repeating the lines
 The lines are often sung, following the harmonized pattern of rhythmic dialogue instead of melodies
 Early blues often took the form of a free narrative
 gayak apane "vyaktigat vishaad ko kathor vaastavik jagat ke saamne prastut karte: khoyaa hua pyaar, police adhikariyon kii krurta, shweton ke haath utpeedan baar mushkil samay" ko swar dene lage
 The lyrics are often related to perceived troubles within african-american society
 udhaaharan ke liye blind lemon jeffrasan kaa "rising hai water bluez" 1927 ke maha mississippi baadh ke bare main batalaata he: However, despite the blues' association with grief and oppression, the lyrics can also be funny and ugly: hokum bluez style main vinodi bol vaali saamagree or oudhami, haasyaaspad pradarshan style donon shaamil the
 Tampa Red's classic "tight Like That" features a playful of syllable words where someone is more obscene with physical overtones
 sangeet kii gitatmak saamagree yudhottar vishaad ke baad kuch halki ho gai, jisane lagbhag vishesh rup se rishton kii samasyaon yaa yon chintaaon par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Several lyrical themes that frequently appeared in pre-war period blues, such as economic depression, farming, devils, gambling, magic, floods, and dry periods, were less common in post-war blues
 lekhak aid morells kaa daawa he ki yoruba puranic kathaon ne praarambhik bluez main bhoomika adaa kii or ve robert johnson ke "cross road bluez" kaa "chauraahey ke prabharee orisha, elegua kaa maheen dhake sandarbh" ke rup main uddhran dete hai
 However, Christian influence was much more pronounced

 The revered Gary Davis and Blind Willie Johnson are examples of artists whose music is often classified as blues musicians, though their lyrics are distinctly spiritual

 In the early 20th century historians began reporting on blues music in South Texas and the far south
 vishesh rup se, charles pibody ne clarxdel, mississippi main bluez sangeet kii maujuudagi kaa ullekh kiya or get thomas ne 1901-1902 ke aas-paas dakshin texas main isi tarah ke geeton kii soochna di
 These observations almost correspond to the memory of Jelly Roll Morton, who declared that he first heard the blues in 1902 in New Orleans; Ma Rainey, who reminisced about her first blues experience in Missouri the same year, and WC Handy first listened to the blues in 1903 in Tuttwiler, Mississippi
 The first extensive research in this area was done by Howard W
 Odom, who published a large collection of folklore between 1905 and 1908 in the counties of Lafayette, Mississippi, and Newton, Georgia

 The way blues music existed before the 1920s is given in recordings by artists such as Lead Bailey or Henry Thomas, both of whom performed old blues music

 The social or economic reasons for the blues to appear are not fully known

 In particular, no particular African musical form can be identified as the only direct origin of the blues
 tathaapi kai bluez tatwon ko, jaise ki kol-and-respons swaroop or blue nots kaa upyog, africa ke sangeet ke saath waapas joda ja saktaa he
 The first occurrence and use of blue notes in blues was confirmed by its African origins by "A Negro Love Song" from English composer Samuel coleridge-taylor's 1898 musical composition The African Suite for Piano, which included Blue Third and Seventh Notes

 yah us sangeet vaadya-yantra ke samaan he, jise griot bajaate hai 
 However, in the 1920s, when country blues were being recorded, banjo use in blues music was minimal and limited to individuals such as Papa Charlie Jackson and later Gus Cannon
 bluez sangeet ne vaadya or hormonic sangat sahit, "ithiopian lay", bhaat pradarshnon or habshiyon ke aadhyatmik geeton se bhi tatwon ko apanaaya he
 The genre also has a close relationship to ragtime, which evolved around the same time, although the "original melodic pattern of African music" is better preserved in the blues

 Depending on the religious community the musician was associated with, playing this following music was considered more or less a sin: Blues was the music of the devil

 In the 1920s, reaching a white audience through Handy's instrumental compositions and classic female blues artists, blues became a major element of african-american and American popular music

 The transition from country to urban blues that began in the 1920s has always been driven by gradual waves of economic crisis and hot markets, and the great migration connected rural blacks to urban areas

 The electron volt is the unit of energy
 yah gatij urja kii vah maatra he, jo ek electron dwaara nirvaat main ek volt kaa vibhavantar paar karne par praapt kii jaati he
 In simple terms, it is equal to the product of 1 volt and 1 electronic charge, where one volt = one joule per coulomb
 
 An electron volt is a very small amount of energy: albert ainstin ke anusaar, urja bhaar ke tulya he, jaisaakh ki prasiddh bhaar-urja-tulyata sutara main vyakt bhi he:e = mc2 
 atah yah bhautik kanon hetu saamaanya he, jahaan poor urja praayah paraspar badalte rahete hai, ev / c2 yaa saraltar ev ko bhaar kii ikai hetu prayog karte hue
 For example, 1
022 mev of energy can be obtained by eradicating the load of both an electron and a cube, 0

 tulana hetu: Transfer factor: ek prakashanu ke urja E, aavriti f or tarangadairghy λ kaa sambandh he: Where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light
 For example, the spectrum of direct light consists of waves ranging from 400 nm to 700 nm
 pratyaksh prakaash ke prakashanuon main urjaaen hoti hai: to ek electron volt ek adhorakt photone kii bhi urja hoti he, jisaki tarangadairghy lagbhag 1240 nm he
 Similarly, 10ev energy is ultraviolet wavelength 124 nm and more

 These successful experiments of tiger haven also led to allegations of Billy spreading genetic pollution in tigers of Dudhwa
