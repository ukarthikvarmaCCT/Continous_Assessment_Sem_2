 There are many areas of scientific research in which information about new and important developments to be made and research-related articles or papers are published in Nature
 haalanki is patrika ke pramukh pathakagan anusandhan karne vaale vaigyanik hai, par aam janata or anya kshetra ke vaigyanikon ko bhi adhikansh mahatvapurn lekhon ke saransh or up-lekhan aasaani se samaj aate hai
 In the beginning of each issue, editorial, articles and news on issues of common interest of scientists, latest news including science-funding, business, scientific ethics and new research related research are printed
 pustakon or kala sambandhi lekhon ke liye bhi alag-alag vibhaag hai
 Most of the research-related articles are printed in the rest of the journal, which is often quite deep and technical

 After that, technological and industrial changes took place on a large scale in Britain and there was a lot of progress
 The most well-known journals of this century were - printed journals published by the Royal Society, with research papers published by great scientists such as Charles Darwin to Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday
 iske alaava, is avadhi ke dauraan, lokapriy vaigyanik patrikaon kii sankhya -1850 ke dashak se 1860 ke dashak kii tulana main - duguni ho gayi
 According to the editors of these popular journals, these publications were conceived so that they could become the "mouthpieces of science" to connect the general public with the scientific world
 haalanki nechar ' kaa janm 1869 main hua, par apane khaas dhang kii yah pehali patrika nahin thi
 Even before 'nature', there used to publish a journal called Recreative Science: a Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation, which started in 1859 - as a general historical journal, but later it included physical observation science and technical subjects
 Happened and articles decreased
 The original name of the magazine has undergone several changes - first the Intellectual Observer, a review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreational Science and finally the Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art
 The 'recreational Science' consisted mostly of physics science subjects such as astronomy and archeology, but the magazine was also expanded to include literature and arts-related subjects in the Intellectual Observer

 Prior to Nature, two other magazines were published in England, namely, Quarterly Journal of Science and Scientific Opinion, which were founded in 1864 and 1868 respectively
 jo patrika nechar ' ke sampadakeey or pariklpana se sabase zyaada milti-julati thi, vah thi - da reader ' - jiskaa janm hua tha 1864 main or jisamen -popyular siance rivyuu ' kii hi tarah - vigyaan ke saath-saath sahitya va kala-sambandhi vishyon kaa bhi samavesh kiya gaya taaki vaigyanik-samudaay ke alaava anya pathakagan bhi faaydaa uthaa saken
 All these similar magazines ultimately failed
 Only Popular Science Review 'lasted the most - that is, for 20 years and finally in 1881 its publication also stopped
 ricreative siance ' or student and intlectual obzarwar ' -in donon kaa prakaashan to 1871 main pehle hi band ho chukaa tha
 All these similar magazines ultimately failed
 Only 'popular Science Review' lasted the most - that is, for 20 years and finally in 1881 its publication also stopped
 quarterli jarnal ' ke sampadakeey vibhaag main anekanek badlaav hue or aakhir 1885 main yah patrika bhi band ho gayi

 The line was - "to the solid ground of nature trusts the mind that builds for income"
 Nature's effort, first published by owner and publisher Alexander Macmillan, was similar to that of its ancestral journals, namely - "to provide an accessible platform for sophisticated readers to read information about scientific progress"
 Janet Brown states, "'nature' was designed, born and developed only to serve a polemical purpose, far surpassing that of any other science journal at the time
" " nechar ' ke praarambhik sanskarnon main, x club naamak ek samooh ke sadasyon dwaara likhit lekh prakashit hote the

 In the late 19th century, this group was strongly criticized by a group of conservative scientists
 Perhaps due to scientific immunity, Nature has achieved, in some parts, more success than her ancestral journals
 John Maddox, editor of Nature 'magazine from 1966 to 1973 and from 1980 to 1995, suggested at the lunchtime edition of the magazine's hundredth edition that "perhaps the quality of journalism of' Nature 'gave readers of' Journalism ' attracted
 madox ne kaha ki "yahi wo tarika he jisase logon main - jo anyathaa ek duusare se alag-alag rahete hai - ek samudaay main hone kii bhaavana ko jagaaya ja saktaa he
 Laukier's magazine did the same thing from the beginning

 In the 20th century, especially in the late 90s, there were many developments and expansions in the journal 'nature'
 imperial college ke professor'norman loukyar nechar ' ke sansthaapak the
 He was followed by Richard Gregory, who took over the reins of the magazine in 1919
 Gregory was instrumental in establishing Nature 'in the international scientific community
 The Royal Society wrote in his death note, "gregory was always very interested in international contacts with science and he always published articles related to the activities of the International Scientific Associations in Nature 'very generously
" From 1945 to 1973, there were three changes in the editorship of Nature - first in 1945 AJV Gail and LJF
 Brimble, then John Maddox in 1965 and finally David Davis in 1973
 In 1980, Meadowx became editor again and remained until 1995

 As a result of these positive responses, there is a fierce competition among scientists to publish their articles in Nature and its closest competitor magazine, Science

 Examples of business analysis include: aisi kai takneekein hai, jinka upyog ek vyapaar vishleshak us samay karata he jab vyapaar main hone vaale parivartanon ko badhaava diya jaataa he
 Their range ranges from the ease of workshop of techniques used to shed light on requirements, techniques used for requirements analysis and organization

 Finally, business analysis seeks to achieve the following results: in lakshyon ke moolyankan kaa ek tarika he sabhi pariyojnaon ke liye nivesh par ritern ) kaa maapan
 Project delays are costly in three different dimensions: adhikansh pariyojnaon par n b pariyojna prabandhak is baat ko sunishchit karata he ki ek pariyojna samay par puri ho
 Ba's job is to ensure that if a project is not completed on time, then at least the highest priority requirements are met
 vyapaar vishlalshak yah sunishchit karnaa chaahate hai ki ve anuprayog ko is tarah se paribhaashit karen ki yah antim upabhokta kii jaruraton ko bhi puraa kare
 multah, ve sahi anuprayog ko paribhaashit karnaa chaahate hai
 Efficiency can be achieved in two ways: by reducing rework and reducing project length
 punah kaam karnaa udyog kaa ek aam sar dard he or yah kai sanghathanon main itnaa aam ho gaya he ki yah pariyojna ke bajet or samay rekha ko bahut adhik prabhavit karata he
 Shortening the length of the project suggests two potential benefits
 har maheene ke liye jab pariyojna ko chota kiya ja saktaa he, pariyojna sansaadhan kii laagat ko anya pariyojna kii ore modaa ja saktaa he
 This can save on the ongoing project and reduce the initial time for future projects

 Vijay wants the marriage to be on contractual basis for a year and if he is not able to make love to his wife in that period, the marriage will end
 haalaanki, megha kaa parivaar gambhir vittiya sthiti main he or isliye use vijay se shaadi karne ke is prastaav par punarvichaar karnaa padataa he
 Vijay and Megha get married
 vivaah ke baad, ve ekasaath rahete hue dostana sambandh bana lete hai
 Megha works hard to support Vijay, heartily cooperates, kneels on the temple stairs, when Vijay is badly injured in an accident
 phir bhi, varsh ke ant main, vijay ne vivaah ko radd karne kaa faisla kiya, jaisaa ki is par sahmati hui thi
 Megha returns home unhappy
 algaav ke baad, vijay anand uthaa rahaa he, lekin dhire-dhire vah apni samarpit patni kii upasthiti kaa mahatva or jarurat mahasoos karne lagata he
 Complications arise when Megha discovers that she is pregnant with Vijay's contact

 Megha works in a new company to run her own life
 vijay megha ko paane ke uddeshy se baari rakam chukaakar us company ko hi kharid letaa he
 When the managing director of the company arrives, Megha is surprised to see Vijay as the managing director, standing with the other employees to welcome him and his mood becomes bizarre
 vijay megha ko vishwaas dilaanaa chahta he ki ab vah ek badla hua vyakti he or use waapas chahta he
 But, despite repeated convictions, Megha remains unconvinced as her faith in him is shattered
 vijay use vishwaas dilaane kii koshish jari rakhata he
 But Megha leaves no chance to show him that she doesn't care for him at all
 baad main, megha or uske parivaar main unke paidaa hone vaale bachche ke kalyaan ke liye 'god-bharaai' kaa samaaroh yojit kiya gaya
 Vishwanath and Vijay also attend the ceremony and give their gifts
 megha ne vijay ke apane pati hone kaa khulaasa kiya or uskaa apmaan karti hui shaadi ke anubandh ke bare main sabhi mehmaanon ko bataaya
 Vijay feels very bad
 vah spashtikaran dete hue kahata he ki jaisi sthiti main vah he usamen yadi vah chaahe to kisi se bhi shaadi karke khushi-khushi rah saktaa he; parantu shaadi kaa anubandh karke usne galati kii he, ise vah hriday se maan rahaa he tathaa aaj bhi vah sachche hriday se ekmaatr megha ko hi pyaar karata he
 This makes the object's position clear to all people
 vijay or unke pita sabhi mehmaanon ke baad baahar nikalate hai
 Nearing the completion of her pregnancy, Megha discovers that troublemakers for Vijay's company, Khairati Lal and Yashwant Kumar, who once attempted to kill Vijay, have escaped from jail
 ve vijay kii talash main hai, jinhone unhen dhokhadhadi or jaalsaji ke liye apane pita kii company se nikaal diya tha
 Megha gets worried and tries to reach Vijay as soon as possible
 raste main hi use pataa chal jaataa he ki yah puraa plan vijay ke doston dwaara use apane pati ke prati aakarshith karne ke liye tha
 Enraged, Megha leaves to insult Vijay
 is bich karyaalay main baithe vijay ke peeche chhip kar aae khayrati laal or yashavanth kumaar vastav main vijay par achaanak hamalaa kar detaa he or uske pet main sheesha ghonpakar use buree tarah ghayal kar detaa he
 But Megha feels that Vijay is pretending to be injured
 vijay ko bura bhala kehete hue megha palat kar jane lagati he tabhi uski ore ghumta hua vijay sheesha nikaalte hue dard se chilla uthta he or megha palat kar dekhati he ki uske pet se khun bah rahaa he tathaa vah buree tarah ghayal he
 She then becomes convinced that Khairati and Yashwant have actually attacked her
 megha uske paas daudti he or phisal jaati he or garbh puraa hone se girane ke kaaran dard se cheekhney lagati he
 Vijay takes Megha to the hospital by tying the shirt on her stomach and incorporating all her strength
 vahi un donon ke ghar vaale bhi pahonchte hai ek ore vijay kaa ilaaj hota he duusari ore megha kaa prasav hota he
 Megha gives birth to a healthy baby and wants to see Vijay first
 uskaa bistar vijay ke bistar ke paas le jaaya jaataa he
 The two meet happily
 vijay ke pita vishwanath un donon ke bich apane pote ko lita kar or apni aadat anusaar teenon se haath mila kar param prasannataa anubhav karte hai

 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr

This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us

 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right

 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"

 The kidneys are found in many vertebrate animals
 ye mutr-pranali ke ang hai
 They regulate the electrolyte, alkali-acid balance and blood pressure
 inkaa mel swarup mutr kehalaata he
 It mainly consists of urea and ammonia
 gurde yugmit ang hote hai, jo kai kaary karte hai
 They are found in many types of animals, including vertebrates and some invertebrates
 ye hamaari mutr-pranali kaa ek aavashyak bhaag hai or ye electrolite niyantran, amla-kshar santulan, va raktchaap niyantran aadi jaise samasthiti kaary bhi karte he
 These act as natural purifiers of blood in the body and remove waste, which is then sent to the bladder
 mutr kaa utpaadan karte samay, gurde uria or ammonium jaise apshisht padaarth utsarjit karte hai; gurde jal, glucose or amino amlon ke punarvasoshana ke liye bhi zimmedaar hote hai
 The kidneys also produce hormones, including calcitriol, renin, and erythropoietin
 audrik guha ke pichley bhaag main retroperitonium The kidneys located in the vesicles receive blood from a pair of renal arteries and flow it into a pair of renal veins
 prayek gurda mutr ko ek mutrvahini main utsarjit karata he, jo ki swayan bhi mutrashay main rikt hone vaali ek yugmit sanrachana hoti he
 The study of kidney function is called renal physiology, while the medical method related to kidney diseases is called Meghalogy
 gurde kii bimaariyaan vividh prakaar kii hai, lekin gurde se judi bimariyon ke rogiyon main aksar vishisht chikitsiya lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 Common medical conditions associated with the kidney include nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute renal lesions, chronic kidney diseases, urethral infections, renal calculi and ureteric obstruction
 gurde ke cancer ke anek prakaar bhi maujuud hai; sabase aam vayask vrikk cancer vrikk koshika karkat he
 Cancer, cyst and some other kidney conditions can be managed by removal of the kidney, or by renal dissection
 jab gurde kaa kaary, jise kechikagucchheey shuddhikaran dar ke dwaara napa jaataa he, lagaataar buree ho, to dyalisis or gurde kaa pratyaropan iske upachaar ke vikalp ho sakate hai
 Although stones are not very harmful, they can also cause pain and problems

 Intense pain in the medial / lateral segments of the back of the back is a common symptom of appendicitis
 manushyon main, gurde udar guha main retroperitonium naamak rikt sthaan main sthit hote hai
 Their number is two and one of these kidneys is located one on either side of the spinal cord; They are approximately at the vertebral level from T12 to L3
 daayan gurda madhyapat ke thik neeche or yakrut ke peeche sthit hota he, tathaa baayan madhyapat ke neeche or pleeha ke peeche hota he
 There is an adrenal gland at the top of each kidney
 yakrut ke kaaran udar guha main pai jane vaali vishmata ke kaaran daayan gurda baayen kii tulana main thodaa neeche hota he or baayan gurda daaen kii tulana main thodaa adhik madhyam main sthit hota he
 The upper part of the kidney is partially protected by the eleventh and twelfth ribs and the entire kidney and adrenal glands are covered by fat and renal bandage
 prayek vayask gurde kaa bhaar purushon main 125 se 170 gram ke bich or mahilaon main 115 se 155 gram ke bich hota he
 Typically, the left kidney is slightly larger than the right
 gurde kii sanrachana saim ke aakaar kii hoti he, prayek gurde main avatal or uttal satahen pai jaati hai
 The concave surface, called the renal nucleus, is the point from which the renal artery enters this organ and the renal vein and ureter exit
 gurda sakht reshedaar utakon, vrikkeey capsule se ghira hota he, jo swayan perinephric vasa, vrikk pattee tathaa paranefric vasa se ghiri hoti he
 The anterior border of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior border is the transversalis bandage
 daaen gurde kii upree seemaa yakruy se satee hui hoti he; or baayin seemaa pleeha se judi hoti he
 Therefore, both of these go down when breathing
 gurda lagbhag 11-14 semi lanbaa, 6 semi chaudaa or 3 semi motaa hota he
 The substance of the kidney, or organism, is divided into two main structures: the renal bark in the upper part and the renal medulla within it
 kul milakar ye sanrachanaayen shanku ke aakaar ke aath se atharah vrikkeey khandon kii ek akruti banaati hai, jinamein se prayek main majja ke ek bhaag ko dhankane vaali vrikk chaal hoti he, jise vrikkeey pyramid kaha jaataa he
 Between the renal pyramids are bark ridges, called renal columns
 nefron, gurde kii mutr utpann karne vaali kaaryaatmak sanrachanaayen, chaal se lekar majja tak faili hoti hai
 The initial purification part of a nephron is the renal corpuscle located in the bark, followed by a renal tubule known deep into the medullary pyramids through the bark
 ek majjatmak kiran, vrikkeey chaal kaa ek bhaag, vrikkeey nalikaaon kaa ek samooh hota he, jo ek ekal sangrahan nalika main jaakar rikt hoti hai
 The end of each pyramid, or sprout, carries urine into the miniature follicle, the miniature follicle empties into the main follicles, and the main follicle empties into the renal pelvis, which becomes the urinaloid
 gurde baayin tathaa dahini vrikk dhamniyon se rakt praapt karte hai, jo sidhe audrik mahadhamani se nikalati hai
 Despite their relatively small size the kidneys receive about 20% of the blood released from the heart
 prayek vrikkeey dhamni anek khandaatmak dhamniyon main vibhajit ho jaati he, jo aage antarkhandtmak dhamniyon main bant jaati hai, jo vrikkeey capsule kaa chhedan karti hai or vrikkeey pyramidon ke bich sthit vrikkeey stambhon se hokar guzarati hai
 Subcutaneous arteries then supply blood to the arterial arteries, which are at the border of the bark and medulla
 prayek chapakar dhamni vibhinn antarkhandtmak dhamniyaan pradaan karti he, jo abhivahi dhamniyon ko bharti hai, jo glomeruli ko rakt kii aapurti karti hai
 Interstitum) is the functional space in the kidney, which is located under single fibers, which are filled with blood vessels
 interstitom mutr se punarprapt hue drav ko avashoshit kar letaa he
 Many conditions can cause scarring or blood clotting in this area, which can result in obstruction of kidney function and may even stop functioning
 shodhan kii prakriya purna ho jane par rakt shirikaon ke ek chote network se hokar guzarataa he, jo antarkhandtmak shiraaon kii ore abhisaran karti hai
 The veins also follow the same arterial distribution pattern, the afferent veins deliver blood to the umbilical veins, and from there it leads to the interdigital veins, which form the renal veins that exit the kidney for blood transfusions
 vrikkeey utak-vigyaan main gurde kii ek sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dikhaai dene vaali sanrachana kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Several distinct cell-types are found in the kidney, including the following: gurda or snaayu tantra vrikkeey jaal ke madhyam se aapas main samvaad karte hai, jiske reshe gurde tak pahunchane ke liye vrikkeey dhamniyon ke saath jude hote hai
 Input from the sympathetic nervous system induces vasoconstrictors in the kidney, causing renal blood flow to decrease
 aisa mana jaataa he ki gurde sahanukampi snaayu tantra se input praapt nahin karte
 gurde se nikalne vaale samvedak input merudand ke T10-11 staron kii ore badhata he or sambandhit antartvacha dwaara mahasoos kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the pain felt in the armpits may be related to the kidneys
 amla-kshar santulan, electrolite sandrata, koshiketar drav maatra ko niyantrit karke or raktchaap par niyantran rakhte hue gurde puure sharir ke homeostasis main bhaag lete hai
 The kidneys perform these homeostatic functions both independently and in association with other organs, particularly the organs of the endocrine system
 in antahsravi kaaryon kii purti ke liye vibhinn antahsravi hormone ke bich talmail kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jinamein renin, angiotensis II, eldosterone, antidiauratic hormone or artial natriuratic peptid aadi shaamil hai
 Many of the functions of the kidney are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of refining, reabsorption and secretion that occur in the nephron
 parishodhan, jo ki vrikkeey kanika main hota he, ek prakriya he jiske dwaara koshikaayen tathaa bade protein rakt se chaane jate hai or ek ultraphiltret kaa nirmaan hota he, jo antat mutr banegaa
 gurde ek din main 180 litre ultraphiltret utpann karte hai, jiskaa ek bahut bada pratishat punarvashoshit kar liya jaataa he or mutr kii lagbhag 2 litre maatra kii utpann hoti he
 The transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate into the blood is called reabsorption
 srav isaki vipareet prakriya he, jisamen anu vipareet disha main, rakt se mutr kii ore bheje jate hai
 Car waste materials emit
 inamen protein apachay se utpann nitrogen-yukt apshisht uria or neucleic amla ke chayapachay se utpann urik amla shaamil hai
 Any significant increase or fall in plasma osmolarity is identified by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior mucous gland
 parasaraniyata main vruddhi hone par yah granthi antidiauratic hormone adiech kaa srav karti he, jiske parinamswaroop gurde dwaara jal kaa punarvasoshana kiya jaataa he or mutr kii sandrata bad jaati he
 These two factors work together to bring plasma osmolality back to normal levels
 adiech sangrahan nalika main sthit mukhya koshikaon se judaa hota he, jo equaporin ko majja main sthanantarit karata he, taaki jal saamanytah abhedya majja ko chhod sake or vaasa riekta dwaara sharir main iskaa punarvasoshana kiya ja sake, jisase sharir main plasma kii maatra main vruddhi hoti he
 There are two systems that create hyperpolar marrow and thus increase the amount of plasma in the body: urea recycling and 'single effect'
 uria saamanytah gurdon se ek apshisht padaarth ke rup main utsarjit kiya jaataa he
 However, when plasma blood volume is low and ADH is released, exposed aquaporins are also susceptible to urea
 isse uria ko ek hyper sangrahan nalika ko chhodkar majja main pravesh karke jal ko ‘aakarshith’ karne vaale ek hyperosmctic vilyan kaa nirmaan karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Urea can then re-enter the nephron and be re-excreted or recycled depending on whether ADH is still present
 ‘ekal prabhaav’ is tathy kaa varnan karata he ki lups of henley kaa motaa arohi ang jal ke dwaara bhedya nahin he, lekin bhu
ni ke dwaara bhedya he
 This means that a counter-flow system is created, through which the medulla becomes more concentrated and if the collecting duct is opened by the ADH, it must be followed by a osmolarity ratio of water
 lambii-avadhi main raktchaap kaa niyantran mukhyatah gurde par nirbhar hota he
 This is mainly through the maintenance of extracellular fluid subdivision, whose size depends on the plasma sodium concentration
 haalanki, gurde sidhe hi raktchaap kaa anumaan nahin laga sakate, lekin nefron ke duurastha bhaagon main sodium or chloride kii supurdagee main parivartan gurde dwaara kiye jane vaale kinvak renin ke srav ko parivartit kar detaa he
 When the extracellular fluid subdivision is expanded and blood pressure is high, the delivery of these ions increases and the secretion of renin decreases
 isi prakaar, jab koshiketar drav upkhand sankuchit ho or raktchaap nimna ho, to sodium or chloride kii supurdagee kam ho jaati he or pratikriyaswaroop renin srav bad jaataa he
 Renin is the first member of a series of chemical messengers that together form the renin – angiotensin mechanism
 renin main hone vaale parivartan antat is tantra ke output, mukhya rup se angiotencin II or eldosteron, ko parivartit karte hai
 Each hormone acts through multiple mechanisms, but both increase the absorption of sodium chloride by the kidneys, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid subdivision and raising blood pressure
 jab renin ke str bade hue hote hai, to angiotencin II or eldosteron kii sandrata bad jaati he, jiske parinamswaroop sodium chloride ke punarvasoshana main vruddhi hoti he, koshiketar drav upkhand kaa vistaar hota he or raktchaap bad jaataa he
 Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, causing contraction of the extracellular fluid subdivision and decreasing blood pressure
 gurde anek prakaar ke hormone kaa srav karte hai, jinamein arethropitin, calcetriol or renin shaamil hai
 Erythropoietin is released as a response to hypoxia in the renal flow
 yah asthi-majja main arethropoasis ko utprerit karata he
 Calcitriol, the catalytic form of vitamin D, encourages intestinal absorption of calcium and renal reabsorption of phosphate
 renin, jo ki renin-angiotencin-eldosteron tantra kaa ek bhaag he, eldosteron staron ke niyantran main shaamil ek enzim hota he
 In mammals, the kidney develops from the intermediate mesoderm
 gurde kaa vikaas, jise nefrogenesis bhi kaha jaataa he, teen kramik charnon se hokar guzarataa he, jinamein se prayek ko gurde ke ek adhik unnat jode ke vikaas dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he: pronfros, mesonefros or metanefros 
 The kidneys of various animals show evidence of developmental adaptation and have long been studied in ecology and comparative physiology
 gurde kaa akruti vigyaan, jise aksar majjatmak motaai ke rup main soochibaddh kiya jaataa he, stanpayi jeevon kii prajatiyon main prakritik awaas ke sookhepan se sambandhit hota he
 Medical glossaries associated with the kidney usually use words such as renal and nephro-prefixes
 visheshan vrikkeey, jiskaa arth hota he, vrikk se sambandhit, latin shabd reness se liya gaya he, jiskaa arth he gurde; upsarg nefro- gurde ke liye prayukt pracheen greek shabd nefros ) se liya gaya he
 For example, removal of the kidney by surgery is called nephrectomy, whereas renal dysfunction is called renal dysfunction
 saamanytah, manushya keval ek gurde ke saath bhi saamaanya rup se jivit rah sakate hai kyonki prayek main vrikkeey utakon kii sankhya jivit rahane ke liye aavashyak sankhya se adhik hoti he
 Long-term kidney diseases will develop only when the amount of functional kidney tissue decreases too much
 Renal replacement treatment, in the form of dialysis or renal transplantation, is required when the glomerular purification rate is greatly reduced or when the symptoms of renal dysfunction are very severe
 adhikansh kasheruki jeevon main, mesonefros ek vayask gurde main parivartit ho jaataa he, haalanki aksar yah adhik unnat metanefros ke saath judaa hua hota he; keval amniot main mesonefros bhrun tak simit hota he
 The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, long limbs that surround a large part of the torso
 nefron ke prayek jhund kii sangrahan nalikaayen ek archinephric nalika main jaakar rikt hoti he, jo ki amniot jeevon ke vaas defrence sadrush he
 However, this situation is not always simple; In cartilage fishes and in some amphibians, there is a small tube similar to the ureter found in amniote organisms, which empties the posterior parts of the kidney and joins the archinephric duct on the bladder or sluice
 vastutah, anek vayask upasthissom machhliyon main, gurde kaa agr bhaag vikrut ho saktaa he yaa puri tarah kaary karnaa band kar saktaa he
 In most primitive vertebrate organisms, hagfish and lampreys, the kidney structure is exceptionally simple: it consists of a line of nephrons, each of which is directly vacillated in the archinephric duct
 aksheruki jeevon main aise utsarjan ang ho sakate hai, jinka ullekh kabhi-kabhi “gurdon” ke rup main kiya jaataa he, lekin, yahaan tak ki emphioxs main bhi, ye kabhi bhi kasheruki jeevon ke gurdon ke sadrush nahin hote or zyada sahi rup se unke liye anya naamon, jaise nefredia kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The kidneys of reptiles are made up of several segments, which are roughly arranged in a linear pattern
 prayek khand ke centre main mutrvahini kii ek ekal shakha hoti he, jisamen sangrahan vahini aakar rikt hoti he
 Reptiles have relatively fewer nephrons than other amniote organisms of the same size, presumably because they have lower metabolic rates
 pakshiyon main apekshaakrit bade, lambey gurde hote hai, jinamein se prayek teen yaa adhik pruthak khandon main vibhajit hota he
 These segments are composed of several small, irregularly arranged segments, each of which is centered on a branch of the ureter
 pakshiyon ke glomeruli kaa aakaar chota hota he, lekin unamem nefron kii sankhya stanpayi jeevon kii tulana main lagbhag doguni hoti he
 The human kidney is a very specific example of mammal organisms
 anya kasheruki jeevon kii tulana main stanpayi gurde ke vishisht lakshanon main, vrikkeey pedu or vrikkeey pyramid kii upasthiti or ek spasht rup se pahachaane ja sakane vaali chaal or majja kii upasthiti shaamil hai
 The latter symptom is due to the presence of a large size of the loops of Henle; They are much smaller in birds and are not found in other vertebrates
 Only in mammal organisms, the kidney is in its traditional "kidney" shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multi-tubular reniculate kidneys of members of the Timberg
 latin shabd reness angrezi bhashaa ke shabd “reens ” se sambandhit he, jo ki shakespeare kaal kii angrezi, jo vah kaal bhi he, jisamen king james varjan kaa anuwaad hua tha, kii angrezi ) main gurde kaa samanaarthi shabd he
 Once upon a time, the kidneys were considered a popular place of conscience and contemplation, and many lines of the Bible are 7: 9, Rev
 2:23) says that God searches for and inspects the kidneys or "kidney" of humans
 isi prakaar, tolmud kahata he ki do main se ek gurda is baat kii salaah detaa he ki kya acha he or doosraa bataata he ki kya bura he
 The kidneys of animals can be cooked and eaten by humans
 gurdon ko saamanytah bhunaa yaa tala jaataa he, lekin bahut jatil khaadya-padaarthon main unhen ek saalan, jo inke swaad ko badhayega, ke saath dhimi aanch par pakaaya jaataa he
 In many substances, such as a mixed grill or Murav Yerushalmi, the kidneys are mixed with pieces of meat or liver
 gurde se banane vaale sarvaadhik pratishthit khaadya-padaarthon main, british stick or kidney pai, swedish hocarpana, french rognos di viyu sos motrarde or spanish “rinons al jerez ”, vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai

 Nature '- This is a major scientific journal of the British which was first published on 4 November 1869
 duniya kii antarvishay vaigyanik patrikaon main is patrika kaa ullekh sabase ucch sthaan par kiya jaataa he
 Now most scientific journals have become highly specialized and Nature is one of the few journals that still publishes original research articles on a vast range of scientific fields
 vaigyanik anusandhan ke aise anek kshetra hai jinamein kiye jane vaale nae va mahatvapurn vikaason kii jaankaree tathaa shodh-sambandhi mul-lekh yaa patr nechar ' main prakashit kiye jate hai
 Although the major readers of this journal are research scientists, the general public and scientists from other fields also understand easily the summaries and sub-writings of most important articles
 har ank ke armbh main sampadakeey, vaigyanikon kii saamaanya dilchaspee vaale muddon par lekh va samachar, tazaa khabaron sahit vigyaan-nidhikaran, vyapaar, vaigyanik naitikta or anusandhanon main hue nae-nae shodh sambandhi lekh chaape jate hai
 There are also separate departments for books and art related articles
 patrika ke shesh bhaag main zyaadaatar anusandhan-sambandhi lekh chaape jate hai, jo aksar kaafii gahare or takneekee hote hai
 Since there is a limit on the length of articles, the journal often only publishes a summary of several articles and other details are published on the magazine's website under supplementary material

 There was another scientific journal similar to the 'recreational Science' - Popular Science Review, which was born in 1862 and comprised of various disciplines of science under different headings - such as: 'scientific Summary' or 'quarterly Retrospect'
 It was also done, along with book reviews and details and observations related to the latest scientific works and publications
 nechar ' se pehle england main do anya patrikaayen prakashit hoti thim, jinke naam the - quarterli jarnal of siance ' or siantific opinian ’ or jinaki sthapana kramash: 1864 va 1868 main hui thi
 The journal that most closely resembled the editorial and vision of Nature was - The Reader - which was born in 1864 and in which - like the Popular Science Review - science as well as literature and art
 Topics were also included so that readers other than the scientific community could also benefit

 The publication of both the 'recreational Science' and the Student and Intellectual Observer - these had already ceased in 1871
 ye sabhi ek jaisi patrikaayen akhirkaar asafal huin
 sirf 'popyular siance rivyuu' hi sabase zyaada - yani 20 varshon tak chali or aakhir 1881 main uskaa prakaashan bhi band ho gaya
 Quarterly Journal's editorial department underwent several changes and finally in 1885 this magazine was also closed
 da reader ' patrika band hui 1867 main or sabase ant main siantific opinian ' - sirf 2 saal tak chalane ke baad, june 1870 main band ho gayi
 Soon after 'the Reader' was discontinued, one of its former editors - Norman Laukier - created a new scientific journal, called 'nature', taken from the line of a poem by noted poet William Wordsworth

 In kang The vast expansion of the magazine began in the 1980s, when more than ten new magazines were introduced
 These new magazines include: 'nature Publishing Group' - which was created in 1999 and also includes Nature ',' Nature Research Journals', 'stockton Press Specialist Journals' and' Macmillan Reference '

 The publication of an article in 'nature' is considered a matter of great pride and these writings are often considered to be excellent, which gives the benefit of promotion, grants-in-aid and important place in major mediums
 in sakaaratmak pratikriyaaon ke parinamswaroop, nechar ' or isaki nikatatam pratiyogi patrika siance ' main apane lekh chhapavane ke liye vaigyanikon main ek jabardast hode lagi rahati he
