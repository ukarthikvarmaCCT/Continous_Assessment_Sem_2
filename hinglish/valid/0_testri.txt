 Fashion design is the art of realizing design and beauty on clothing and accessories
 fishan dizine saanskrithik or saamaajik vyavhaar se prabhavit hote hai or samay or jagah ke saath badalte rahe hai
 
 Fashion designers work in various ways in designing clothes and accessories
 kuch diziner akele yaa kuch samooh main kaam karte hai
 They satisfy the consumer's desire for elegantly designed clothing and since the design takes time to reach the market, they often predict consumer choice
 vastav main kuch diziner itane pratishthit hai ki ve hi fishan kaa chalan nirdhaarit karte hai
 Fashion designers try to make their clothes look good not only in terms of utility but also in looks
 They should keep in mind who will wear that cloth and on which occasions it will be worn
 They have a wide range of fabrics and combinations of materials to work with, as well as a wide range of colors, patterns and styles
 haalanki zyaadaatar rozaana pahane jane vaale kapadey paaramparik style kii shrenee main aate hai, par kuch alag tarah kii poshaaken kuch khaas maukon ke liye hoti hai, jaise ki shaam ko pahane jane vaali poshaaken yaa phir party main pahane jane vaale paridhaan
 Some clothes are made for a particular person, such as haute couture or off-the-rack
 Nowadays most of the clothes are made for the general public, especially casual and everyday clothes
 fishan diziner kai tareekon se kaam kar sakate hai
 Fashion designers can work solely for one fashion, known as 'in-house-designers' who hold the right to design
 ve akele kaam kar sakate yaa phir kisi samooh ke saath
 freelance diziner khud ke liye kaam karte hai, wo apni dizine fishan house ko bechate hai, sidhe dukaanon ko yaa phir kapadaa nirmaataaon ko
 Clothing is labeled by the manufacturers
 kuch fishan diziner apana khud kaa label viksit karte hai or usee ke tahat ve apane dizinon kaa vipanan karte hai
 Some fashion designers are self-employed and design for individual customers
 anya ucch fishan diziner vishesh store yaa hai-fishan department store kii zaruuraton ko puraa karaten hai
 These designers not only make original garments, but also such garments which are in line with fashion trends
 zyaadaatar fishan diziner paridhaan nirmaataaon ke liye kaam karte hai, aam janata ke purushon, mahilaon or bacchon ke fishan ke dizine bhi viksit karte hai
 Large well-known designer brands such as Calvin Klein, Gucci or Chanel's apparel are designed by a group of individual designers under the direction of the Director of Design
 == sangrah kii dizining ==fishan sangrah, dizineron dwaara har sizan banaaye gaye vastron kaa sankalan he jiske madhyam se ve ucch shrenee ke paridhaan or saamaanya varg shrinkhalaa ke nae prachlit vastra ko saath main pradarshit karte hai
 It is believed that by this they also make the previous one or two seasons of apparel obsolete
 ek fishan sizan yaa to sharad / sardi yaa vasant / greeshm ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 == Clothing Designing == Fashion designers work in different ways
 kuch kaagaj par apane vichaaron ke rekhachitr banaate hai, jabaki anya ek poshaak ke rup main kapade kii sajaavat karte hai
 When a designer is / is fully satisfied with the fitting of his or her design made of toilets, he or she creates a practical design of the design on the fabric with the help of a professional design developer
 pattern nirmaataa kaa kaary bahut sateek or kathin he
 The fitting of the garment depends on their precision
 ant main, ek namoonay ke taur par ek paridhaan banataa or ek model par uskaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 Fashion design is generally thought to have originated in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth, the first designer to label his name on his clothing
 draper, charles fredrick worth dwaara paris main apana mason kochar sthapit karne se pehle, kapadon kaa dizine evam nirmaan zyaadaatar anaam darjinon dwaara kiya jaataa tha or ucch fishan kii avadharana shahi darbar ke vastron se aati thi
 Worth's success was such that he himself told them what they should wear, rather than what the customers said, when other designers at the time worked according to what the customers told them
 vastav main shabd koshurier kaa prayog pehali baar uskaa varnan karne ke liye hi kiya gaya
 In educational use, we study any timewear as dress design, while any fabric manufactured after 1858 is under fashion design
 isi avadhi ke dauraan kai anya dizine house bhi chitrakaaron ko kaam par rakh kar vastron ke dizine ko chitrit karwaane lage
 These pictures, which were much cheaper than producing an actual garment, were shown to customers
 agar graahak ko unka dizine pasand he, to graahak ke aadesh par ve us paridhaan ko taiyaar karvaa dete the or us taiyaar paridhaan se unhen munafa hota tha
 Thus, instead of presenting the entire garment on models to customers, the tradition of garment design drawings prepared by designers proved to be inexpensive
 vastra nirmaataaon dwaara utpaadit vastra teen mukhya shreniyon main aate hai, haalanki inako or bhi vishisht shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: By the 1950s, most fashion apparels were either measure-made or designed and made according to haute-couture, a garment designed for an individual-specific customer
 ek ucch-fishan paridhaan akele graahak ke aadesh par nirmit hota he or aamtaur par ucch gunvattta vaale, mahange kapade se, baarikiyon par dhyaan dete hue, aksar hast-nirmit va samay lene vaali vidhiyon se sila jaataa he
 Their appearance and texture are more important than the cost of their materials and the time it takes to make them
 pahanane-ko-taiyaar kapade jan bazaar or hot-kochar ke bich ke hote hai
 They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in clothing selection and measurement
 ye kapade choti maatra main banaae jate hai jinase ki inaki vishistataa kii guarantee rahe, isiilie ye mahange hote hai
 The ready-to-wear collections are usually performed by the fashion house every year on a fixed-week fashion week
 iskaa aayojan shahari aadhaar par, saal main do baar hota he
 Currently, sales of the fashion industry depend heavily on the mass market
 jan bazaar, graahakon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karata he, maanak maapon ke anusaar, pahanane-ko-taiyaar kapadon kaa kaaphi maatra main utpaadan hota he
 Creatively inexpensive goods create affordable fashion
 jan bazaar ke diziner, nami dizineron dwaara sthapit vichaardhaaraon ko apanaate hai
 They often use inexpensive clothing and simple production techniques, before making a model of an original design, often wait a season to determine how much a style will go, to save money and time, Can be easily produced by machines
 isliye ant-utpaada bahut adhik saste main bechaa ja saktaa he

 kai peshewar fishan diziner fishan ke kisi ek vishesh kshetra kii visheshgyata se shuruyaat karte hai
 The smaller and more specialized the market, the more likely the company is to give its garments a right size and price
 agar ek company alag-alag utpaadon kii bajaay ek vishesh prakaar ke utpaada se jaani jaati he to usko is udyog main apni pahchaan banane main aasaani hoti he
 Once a fashion company is established, it can then decide to expand into new territory

 There is another continent to its west, named Valinor
 valinore devataaon kii bhoomi he jahaan insaan nahin ja sakate
 The story begins with a black demon in Middle Earth named Sauron who specializes in black magic
 pratham yug ke ant main souron apane shaitani maalik morgoth melcor kii devataaon dwaara haar se batch nikalataa he
 In the second era, Sauron dreams of becoming the king of the world
 iske liye wo tohafon ke maalik annatar kaa sundar bhes banaakar gandharvon ke paas gaya or unke loharon ke mukhiya celebrimbor or duusare loharon ko dhokhe se phusalaakar unase kai jaadui anguuthiyaan banavaain
 But in a mysterious and secret way he made another gold ring himself: that ring
 isamen usne duniya kii sari shaitaniyat or jaadui takat bhar di
 That one ring was the master of all the other rings and the one wearing it could make all the ring wearers their slave
 ye yojana naakaamayaab hoti he jab gandharvon ko is dhokhe kaa pataa chalata he or wo apane liye banaayi teen angoothiyon ko utaar dete hai
 Sauron Gandharva snatches all the rings to make this war
 saat anguuthiyaan souron ne bunon ke saradaaron ko deen or nau insaanon ke saradaaron ko
 The Gandharvas hid their three rings after saving them
 boune apane aantarik jaadu kii vajah se angoothiyon se khaas prabhavit nahin hue, par insaan prabhavit hue
 The nine ring-wearers became demonic phantoms within a few years and remained Sauron's loyal servants until the end
 numenore dweep kaa raja aar-faraajoun madhya dharti par kabza karne aata he or soron ko bandi banaakar numenore le jaataa he
 Conversely there, Sauron lures the king and leads him to wickedness and annihilates the island of Numanor and almost all the Numanorites
 kuchhek achche numenori insaan madhya bhoomi tak bachakar pahunch jate hai or vahaan ek nayi sabhyataa basaate hai : gondor kaa rajya
 Here Amar Sauron takes another form and reaches back to the middle ground, ending the rest of the Numenoris

 The crown prince of the Numanoris, Isildur Elendil, bites Sauron's finger from his dead father's broken talvar narcil and snatches a ring from it and ends Sauron's physical existence

 This is how the third era begins
 ab numenoroyon ke naye raja isildur kaa karttavya banataa tha ki wo us ek anguthi ko vinaash ke parvat, jo ek jwalamukhi tha, main jalte hue lave main daal de, kyonki is dusht anguthi or iske swami ke sarvanaash kaa koi or tarika nahin tha
 But that one ring had a magical desire of its own, to somehow return to its master Sauron
 us jaadui anguthi ke prabhaav se isildur ne use nasht nahin kiya balki apane paas rakh liya
 Later some demons killed him and dropped his body in the river
 is tarah wo shaitani anguthi pani main gum ho gayi, ek puure yug ke liye
 This whole story is mostly mentioned in the novel The Silmarillon

 Golum transforms that satanic ring into a mad, ugly and evil beast
 ek hobit bilbo bagins ko apni romaanchak yatra ke dauraan kisi tarah gollum se wo shaitani anguthi mil jaati he
 Bilbo's old age begins the story of the novel The Lord of the Rings
 wo shaitani anguthi koi jad yaa achetan vastu nahin thi, balki usamen apni khud kii ek chahat, ek ichha thi
 The ring itself was chosen as its short-lived owner, so that it could return to its rightful owner, Sauron
 agar koi bhi us anguthi ko apni ungali main pahane, to wo duniya kii nazar se gaayab ho jaataa tha 
 After some time, Sauron returned as Mordor's demonic tower back to Bard-far
 usne ek vishaal aankh kaa rup le liya, jo aag se ghiri rahati thi or hameshaa wo anguthi dhundti rahati thi
 If a person wore a ring, this search would be fast and Sauron started to feel something about the wearer's address
 agar us vaqt aas-paas koi nazgul ho to use turant anguthi pahananevaale kaa pataa lag jaataa tha
 The wearer of the ring, just like wearing it, would have reached another hazy world
 us vyakti ko dhundhala dikhaayi dene lagata tha, lekin sunne kii shakti koob tej ho jaati thi
 Sometimes in such a situation Sauron and the wearer could even see each other
 or to or, angoothivahak ko is anguthi kii lat lag jaati thi or use is anguthi se ek ajeeb bandhan ho jaataa tha
 The ring was made of pure gold and no gems were attached to it

 us samay kai jaaduugaron main se ek vruddh jaadugar gandalf ko shaq hua ki wo sone kii anguthi kahin wo khoi hui shaitani anguthi to nahin
 Gandalf's suspicion turned out to be correct
 usee samay gollum se souron ko khabar lagi ki anguthi shaayar main he
 Sauron immediately dispatched nine terrifying Nazgul Shires

 With the help of another Gandharva, Frodo reached Rivendell where he was treated

 uske apane bholepan main saruman ko sab sach sach bataa diya
 But Saruman's heart was filled with satanism and greed
 usne gandai ko minar ke upar kaid kar liya or daityon kii ek apni sena banane laga -- uruk haai, jinpar din ke ujaale kaa kuprabhav nahin padataa
 Gendaf escaped from the Orthank and reached Rivendale
 revendel main elrond ne ek parishad aahut kiya, jisamen madhya dharti kii sabhi azaad naslon ke pratinidhi shaamil the
 Upon Frodo's debut there, it was decided that Frodo would become the ring bearer and that s would go to Mordor and throw him in the mountain of doom in Lawe's hull, causing the ring and Sauron to be destroyed
 in sab ke liye anguthi kii maitri banaayi gayi, jinamein the : frodo, sam, meri, pippin, gandai, aragorn, boromir, legolas or gimli 
 Maitri tried to pass through the pass of the Karadras mountain peak towards Mordor, but the conscious Karadras did not give way to them

 There, a black firefighter fell into the depths of Gandalf Khan while fighting the disease

 After this, these people went to the border of Gondor through boats in Mahanadi Anduin

 Frodo himself decided that now he can take this ring to Mordor and he will have to walk this path alone

 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 sabhi buddha sampradaay tathagat buddha ke mul siddhant hi maanate hai
 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists
 har ghatana multah shunaya hoti he
 However, humans, who have the power of knowledge, can attain nirvana by abandoning Trishna, which is the cause of sorrow, turning the power destroyed in Trishna into knowledge and meditation

 Nothing permanent

 Buddha has told how the creation of the universe in brahma-jala Sutra
 sristi kaa nirmaan hona or nasht hona baar-baar hota he
 Ishwara or Mahabrahma does not create the universe because the world operates on the rule of Pratyatmasutpad i
e
 the working-sense
 bhagwaan buddha ke anusaar, manushyon ke du:kha or sukh ke liye karm jimmedaar he, ishwar yaa mahabrahma nahi
 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable

 He values people of his own sect
 buddha dharm kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he
 Grief does not mean pessimism, but relativism and realism

 He said that anyone can become a Buddha if he attains the Bodhisattva by following the ten Paramitas in full and attains the ten forces or lands after the Bodhisattva
 buddha dharm kaa antim lakshya he sampoorn maanav samaaj se dukh kaa ant
 "I teach only one substance - there is sorrow, there is a cause of sorrow, there is a cure for sorrow, and there is a way to restrain sorrow"
 buddha dharm ke anuyaayi ashtangik maarg par chalakar na ke anusaar jikar agyanta or dukh se mukti or nirvana paane kii koshish karte hai
 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped

 Buddhist followers also consider Sarnath's clay, stones and kankars as sacred

 eps ekal Chromosomes or chromosomes are fibrous nodules found in cells of all flora and fauna, which determine and transmit all genetic properties
 prayek prajati main gunasutron kii sankhya nishchit rahati hai
 The number of chromosomes in a human cell is 46, in pairs of 23
 iname se 22 gunasutra nar or maadaa main samaan or apane-apane jode ke samajaat hote he
 These are collectively called homologous chromosomes
 23wein jode ke gunasutra stri or purush main samaan nahin hote jinhe vishamjaat gunasutra kehete he
 In the structure of a chromosome, two substances are specifically incorporated - di en e hi anuvanshik padaarth he
 The structure of the DNA molecule consists of four organic compounds: two purines, two pyrimidines, one sugar-deoxyribose, and phosphoric acid
 purine main adinine or guanin hote he or pirimidine main thymin or cytosin 
 a molecule of DNA has two formulas, which ring around each other in a spiral form
 prayek di en e sutara main ek ke peeche ek chaaron carbonic samaakshar is kram se hote hai-thymin, cytosin, adinin or guanin, evam ve paraspar ek vishesh dhang se jude hote hai
 a unit of these four chambers and their related sugars and phosphoric acid molecule is a tetranucleotid and a DNA molecule is formed of several millennium tetranucleotids
 vibhinn praaniyon ke di en e kii vibhinnata kaa kaaran he - samaakshaaron ke anukram main antar hona
 DNA and a similar nucleic acid RNA combine with ultraviolet in the region of most 2,600 angstroms due to the presence of organic clear
 isi aadhaar par di en e kaa ek koshika sambandhi maatraatmak aagaman kiya jaataa he
 Two special types of centrosomes are found in beings
 ek to kuch deptra insecta main dimbhiy largranthi ke centrakon main paaya jaataa he
 These chromosomes are several hundred times longer and wider than ordinary chromosomes of the same species
 is kaaran inhen mahagunasutra kehete hai
 Their structure appears to be somewhat different from the simple centrosome and semisolid centers
 yahan ek gunasutra ke sthaan par ek anuprastha pankti aisi kanikaon kii hoti he jinamein abhiranjit hote kii yogyata adhik hoti hai
 All the corpuscles of many such transverse rows from one end of the chromosome to the other are identical and the corpuscles of the other rows have characteristics and differences
 in gunasutron ke adhik lambey hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa he ki inkaa purna rup se visarpelikaran hota he or kadachit protein kaa kuch badhaav bhi hota hai
 The reason for being wider is that a chromosome synthesizes another nucleus similar to its own
 saadhaaran avasthaa main samasutran ke samay ye donon sutara ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai, parantu mahagunasutra main yah nahin hota
 The two sutras remain connected to each other
 mahagunasutra kii sankhya saadhaaran gunasutra kii sankhya kii aadhi hoti he, kyonki prayek sutara apane samaan duusare sutara se yugmit ho jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called somatic coupling
 jantuon main vicitra prakaar kaa ek or bhi gunasutra paaya jaataa he
 Its lampbrush is called chromosome
 ye gunasutra aise jantuon ke andon ke centrakon main paae jate hai jinamein andpit kii maatra adhik hoti he, jaise machhlee, ubhaychar, urag, pakshigan ityadi
 The chromosomes are made up of two coupled formulas similar to ordinary diplotene-diakinisis chromosomes
 donon yugmit sutara kuch sthanon par ek duusare se jude hote hai or shesh sthanon par ek duusaren se dur dur rahete hai
 These joints are considered kijma
 prayek sutara par, jisakon chromonima kehete hai, sthaan sthaan par vibhinn parisaan kii kanikas hoti hai jinako chromemrs kehete hai
 Each chromomier has a pair or more lateral clusters attached
 parshvapash bhi chromonima ke sadrush sutara kaa bana hota he, parantu iske chaaron ore rebonuclio-protein kanikas ekatrit ho jaati hai jisase ye sutara mote dikhaai dete hai
 Chromomers also breed with chromonima
 centrekaayen vishesh gunasutra par utpann hoti hai
 In most cells each chromosome has two integral clusters
 paripakv lingakoshikaon main ek kulak rah jaataa he
 Such animals and cells are said to be diploid, but some animals, especially plants, have more than two kulas of chromosomes
 yadi kisi dwiguneet praani ke cendraksutra dugune ho jaae, jisase uski koshikaaye main prayek sutara chaar chaar hon jaise, to aise praani kaa atopoliploid kehete hai
 If the chromosome of a diploid hybrid is doubled, such a creature is called an allopolyploid
 yadi ek dwiguneet praani kaa, jiskicendraksutra k1 k1 kha1 kha1 ga1 ga1 ityadi hai, kisi duusare praani se, jiske gunasutra k2 k2 kha2 kha2 ga2 ga2 ityadi hai, sankaran kiya jaae to uski santan ke gunasutra k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ga1 ga2 ityadi honge
 A1 a2 b1 b2 etc
 will be different from each other and there will not normally be coupling
 yadi is praani ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to unki koshikaaye main k1 k1 k2 k2; kha1 kha1kha2 kha2; ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2, ityadi gunasutra honge
 This will be called allopolyploid
 poliploid main chaar se adhik kulak bhi ho sakate hai
 It is clear that the autopolyploid will produce quadruplexes in the zygotein state, because each of the four chromosomes of each type is present, and the coupling of the four formulas creates one quadrupole
 koshikavibhaajan ke samay prayek dhruv ko baraabar baraabar sankhya main gunasutra nahin milenge
 Often it happens that three threads reached a pole due to the breakdown of a quadrilateral and only one thread reached its opposite pole
 koshikavibhaajan ke ant par bane hue santati koshikaon main gunasutra yaa to adhik sankhya main honge yaa kam main or aise asantulan kaa parinaam yah hota he ki koshika mar jaati he
 This is why autotetraploids are much less fertile
 autotetraploid paudhe saadhaaran dwiguneet paudhon se bahut bade hote hai tathaa unke beej bhi bahut bade hote hai, jisase urvartaa kam hone par bhi ye gruhasthi ke liye adhik laabhadaayak siddh ho sakate hai
 By providing frost, or with the effect of some alkaloids, plant autopolyploids can be made
 elotetraploid main dasha iske vipareet hoti hai
 If the two primitive parent formulas are completely different from each other, the allopolyploid is functionally diploid and will be completely fertile
 jaise, yadi kisi sankar main k1 k2, kha1 kha2, ga1 ga2 se sutara sarvatha bhinn hon to aisa sankar bandhya hoga, parantu iske gunasutron ke dugune hone se yah avasthaa badal jaaygi
 Such cells will have formulas such as A1, 1A, 2A2, B1B1B2B2, C1C1, C2C2, etc
 and the branches that contain such cells will flower, because such cells will have successful myiotic division, coupled with A1A1, B1B1, etc
 
 datura stramonium main dwiguneet avasthaa main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran ke samay dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its autopolyploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes and at the time of meiosis, 12 quiescent are formed
 isi bhanti primmula sinencis se dwiguneet paudhe main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or autotetraploid main 48 sutara hote hai evam ardhasuthran ke samay isamen 9 se 11 chatu:sanyojak or 2 se 6 tak dwisanyojak banate hai
 The diploid of Solomon lycopersicon has 12 pair chromosomes and its autotetraploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes
 ye sab paudhe hai
 The creepis rubra and araepis foetida have 5 pairs of chromosomes
 inke sutara ek duusare se bahut bhinn nahin hote or inke sankaran se utpann sankar main ardhsutran ke samay 5 dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its allopolyploid consists of 20 centrioles and in meiosis there are 0 to 5 quadruple connectives and 0 to 10 divisors
 spasht he ki elotetraploid bahut urvar nahin hoga
 Primula floribanda and Primula resticillata both have nine pair of chromosomes, which are often identical
 inke sankaran se jo sankar banaata he uske prituja kivensis kehete hai
 It also has 9 pairs of chromosomes
 ardhasuthran ke samay main yugman kriya safal hoti he or 9 dwisanyojak banate hai
 The allopolyploid formed by the diploid of the formulas has 9 quaternary formulas and in such plants 12 to 18 are divalent and 0 to 3 quadruple
 spasht he ki chatu:sanyojaakon kii sankhya bahut kam he or kabhi kabhi ek bhi chatu:sanyojak nahin banataa
 Radish and Karamkalla each have 9 pairs of chromosomes, which are completely different from each other
 inke sankaran se utpann sankar refanas brasika main bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai; parantu ardhasuthran main ek hi dwisanyojak nahin banataa, kyonki yugman kii kriya safal nahin hoti or sabhi sutara ayugmit rah jate hai jisase 12 ek-sanyojak banate hai
 The allotetraploid resulting from its formula diploid consists of 12 pair formulas and the meiosis consists of 12 valence, quadrilateral none
 parinaam yah hota he ki refanas-brasika-elotetraploid bahut urvar hota he, yadhyapi refanas-brasika-dwiguneet bandhya hota he
 Polyploidy is rarely found in animals, but it is most often found in non-sterile animals
 paudhon main bahut si nai jatiyaan poliploid ke kaaran utpann hui hongi
 This is evidenced by the fact that about half of the species of angiosperms are such that the number of chromosomes of mature gametes is multiplied by the number of alleles of a related race
 gehun kii kai jatiyaan hai
 The basic zygote center number of these castes is 7
 gunasutron kii sankhya gehun kii jatiyon main 7 kii guneet 14,21,42 tathaa 49 tak pai jaati he
 Similarly, the number of chromosomes in different species of tobacco is 12 or 12 multiplied by 24
 paudhon main prayog dwaara bahut se poliploid banaae gaye hai, jinamein ekaatmak sutron ke do kulak hote hai
 They are fertile
 isamen andeh nahin ki koshikadravya, cendrak ke niyantran main kaaryshil hota he
 Many types of cell groups are engaged in conducting other tasks
 udhaahrant: agnyash kii exocrine koshikaaye vishesh pachak kinvaj utpann karti hai
 The cells of the renal tubule extract the urea from the blood and the liver cells converge to glucose by converting them into glycogen
 spasht he ki kisi bhi praani kii prayek koshika main uske sab jin saadhaarant: upasthit hote hai
 Therefore, at the origin of different types of proteins of different types of cells, some suitable genes must have been active and the rest have become inactive and the same thing will happen with respect to their activation

 It was edited and produced in collaboration with many scholars, activists under the leadership of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das and under the support of a penetrating critic such as Acharya Ramchandra Shakla and Hindi litterateur and under the editorship of Balakrishna Bhatt Shri Amir Singh, Shri Jaganmohan Varma Shri Bhagwadin and Shri Ramachandra Varma Kosh was a great effort

 It has some achievements that are praiseworthy and praiseworthy
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki hidi shabdhsagar ke ananthar bane hidi ke sabhi chote bade koshon kaa yahi mahakosh upjivy or aadhaar rahaa
 The Hindi translation of this acclaimed work of Sri Ramachandra Varma, the eminent editor of Hindi dictionary, is mainly Hindi words
 uskaa mul kalevar tathvik rup main shabdhsagar se hi adhikanshtah pariklit he
 Most of the material in other dictionaries of Hindi is also derived from this dictionary
 purvavarti adhikansh hindi koshon kii bhanti hindi shabdhsagar ek vyakti dwaara nirmit na hokar bhashaa or sahitya ke marmajna anek sudhiyon dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya
 With the help of not only the old dictionary for vocabulary, it was an attempt to collect almost all the common and special words available in texts and practical language and dialects
 praayah prayek shabd kaa mul strot dekhne ke prayaas ke saath saath vibhinn bhashamulak sroton kaa nirdesh karne kii cheshtaa hui
 Although there are many derivatives, which are doubtful and misleading or even impure at some places, the effort and effort as it is for it also holds great importance in itself
 vyakaranamulak vyavastha or tadnusaar shabd evam arth ke vyavasthit nirdesh kaa hindi shabdhsagar main atyant praudh viniyojan dikhaai detaa he
 While Sanskrit dictionaries have wide influence on synonyms and on the one hand, more and more compound words are also mentioned more and more based on Sanskrit grammar, on the other hand the assessment and compilation of the nature and usage tradition of Hindi has also been done with great diligence and mindfulness
 is
 hindi ke muhaavaron or lokoktiyon yaa prayogon athwa kriyaprayogon kii prayagparampara se aagat arthon kii vyakhya bhi isamen paryaapt praudh he
 Explanatory method has been adopted in the semantics in Shabdasagar
 par saath hi mukhya shabdon ke antargat adhiktah paryaay bhi rakh die gaye hai
 For this reason, sometimes it seems that this dictionary has become synonymous with modern form and non-synonymous dictionary together
 vyaakhyaatmak paddati ke antargat vyakti, vishay, vastu aadi kaa puranic, aitihaasik, shastreey or paramparaagat anek prakaar ke parichay evam vivaran yathasthaan die gaye he
 For this reason, this dictionary is also seen touching the environment of encyclopedia, encyclopaedia, charitakosh and technical dictionary
 isamen kuch kamiyaan bhi ginai ja saktin hai
 Experiments and authenticity of all meanings of words are not universally cited examples
 jahaan hai vahaan bhi bahudhaa granthon ke nammaatr hi nirdisht hai
 Their context and version are not mentioned
 anek sthalon par bolchaal ke swanirmit udhaaharan bhi niojit kiye gaye hai
 All in all it has made the periphery of both vocabulary and semantics as broad and wide as possible
