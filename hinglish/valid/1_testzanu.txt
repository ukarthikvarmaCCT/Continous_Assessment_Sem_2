 Scholars and language experts are of the opinion that the practice of informers has been going on since the beginning
 surkaksharon ke pracheen udhaaharan pracheen kaal ke sikkon or shilalekhon main aasaani se dekhe ja sakate hai jabaki sikkon tathaa shilalekhon par sthaan kii kami tathaa shilalekhon par likhane ke shram ko bachaane ke liye bhi shabdon ke sankshipt roopon yaa suchakaksharon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 In modern times, coins of various countries are also seen
 pracheen lekhashastra main bhi suchakaksharon ke anek udhaaharan milte hai
 In ancient scripture, there are two main reasons for writing words in short form or using informers in place of original words - ek hi prasang main anek baar prayukt hone vaale bade yaa clisht shabd yaa shabdon ko puure rup main baar-baar likhane kaa shram bachaane kii ichha
 In such a situation, signifiers were used in place of the original word or words only when their meaning is easily understood in the same way as when the original word was written, likhane kaa sthaan bachaane kii ichha arthath simit sthaan main adhik se adhik likhane kii ichha
 If an author uses a simple notation for a specific or big word in a book or article of a scientific or technical subject, it is often seen that the notation used by him is related to the same subject by other writers and scholars too soon
 Let's take it
 kanoonee dastavejon, saarvajanik or nijee kaagajon tathaa din-pratidin ke upyog main aane vaale anya anek prakaar ke kaagajon main bhi praaia: dekha jaataa he ki baar-baar prayog main aane vaale bade tathaa clisht shabdon ke suchakakshar prachlan main aa jate hai
 These indices are first created by a particular person for his personal use only, but later others find them convenient and gradually start using them
 suchakaksharon kaa saralatam rup vah he jisamen kisi shabd ke liye ek akshar yaa adhik se adhik do yaa teen aksharon kaa prayog hota he
 In ancient Greek coins, instead of the full name of cities, only the first two or three letters of their names are found
 isi prakaar pracheen shilalekhon main shaharon ke naam ke saath-saath kuch anya bade or clisht shabdon ke suchakakshar bhi milte hai
 In ancient Rome, the meaning of official positions, titles or titles was understood only by their initials
 suchakakshar jab kuch samay tak nirantar prayog main aate rahete hai tab kuch kaal ke baad ve likhit bhashaa ke hi ang ban jate hai
 There are many such indicators found in ancient Greek literature which are also prevalent in modern Greek language in the same form and meaning as they were used hundreds of years ago
 vartmaan kaal main bhi ham dainik jivan kii bolchaal kii tathaa likhit bhashaa main aise bahut se suchakaksharon kaa prayog karte hai to ab bhashaa ke hi ang ban chuke hai or jinka puraa rup bahut hi kam logon ko gyaat he
 These types of notations are rarely written or spoken as root words

 Looking at the material related to ancient Egypt and which are safe in the Museum of Cairo and the British Museum, it is seen that the informants were used in ancient Greek and Latin languages also
 pracheen unani bhashaa main suchakakshar banane kii vidhi bahut saral thi
 Either the first word of the original word was written, drawing two cross lines in front of it, or the fraction of the original word had to be omitted, the first letter of the original word was written slightly above the initial part of the original word
 kabhi-kabhi is prakaar do akshar bhi praarambhik ansh se kuch upar likhe jate the
 Aristotle's handwritten texts on the constitution of Athens, which are available and believed to be written by first-century clerks, also use informants
 in granthon main kaarkchinh tathaa kuch anya shabdon ke suchakakshar nirmaan kii ek niyamit vidhi dekhne ko milti he
 The sixth-century copies of the "iliad" in the British Museum are also safe, and the use of informers is also found
 in pratiyon main jin shabdon ke liye suchakaksharon kaa prayog kiya gaya he, unke pratham akshar ke aage angreji ke ch ke samaan chihn bana hua he jisase yah pataa chalata he ki ye shabd sankshipt rup main likhe gaye hai
 In the Bible too, informants are often used for the names of saints
 latin bhashaa main suchakakshar ke rup main bade shabdon ke pratham akshar likhane kii pratha bahutayat se milti he
 By this method, often the noun, name, title, title, and common words coming from the works of highly reputed writers have also been abbreviated
 is pratha ke anusaar mul shabd kaa pratham akshar likhane ke baad uske aage ek bindu rakhkar suchakakshar kaa bodh karaayaa jaataa tha
 But this method can be used only to a certain extent because there are many words starting with the same letter
 suchakakshar aisa hona chahie ki usase kisi nishchit prasang main kisi nishchit shabd ke atirikt anya kisi shabd kaa bhram na ho
 Probably for this reason, in Latin language, the use of the first letter of the original word for informants as well as some special signs next to it
 mudran kala kaa avishkaar hone ke purv lekhan kaary main suchakaksharon kaa prayog adhik hone laga tha
 Even sometimes 4-5 signatures in the same sentence were used simultaneously, which often led to great confusion
 aadhunik yug main suchakaksharon ke prayog main jis gati se vruddhi hui he use dekhte hue yah yug anya baton ke saath hi saath suchakaksharon kaa yug bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 The number of signatures has become so high that many small collections of them have been published in the English language
 jaisaa pehle batalaaya ja chukaa he, adhikansh suchakakshar kisi khaas uddeshy yaa kshetra ke liye hi nirmit kiye jate hai
 When this particular objective is fulfilled or the work of that area is finished, those indexes also disappear
 antat: ek samay aisa bhi aata he jab unka astitv bhi nahin rah jaataa
 During the last World War period, various government departments of Europe and America and various military indicators were used for military operations
 yudhkaal ke baad jab ye sarkari karyaalay or vibhaag anaavashyak ho jane ke kaaran band kar die gaye yaa un vibhaagon kaa kaary samaapt ho gaya to unke liye prayukt kiye jane vaale suchakaksharon kii bhi koi upyogita nahin rah gai
 As a result, most of the inscriptions at that time have become unknown today
 angreji bhashaa main suchakaksharon kaa prayog 14veen sadi se hi hone laga tha
 As an example of the well-known index used in the 14th century, we can take the word "cam" which was used for Carmelites, Augustinians, Jacobians, and Minarities, and is formed by combining the first letters of these words
 17veen sadi main england ke itihaas main "cebaal" naamak parliament prasiddh he
 The name was coined by combining the first letters of five ministers of the then government, Clifford, Arlington, Burkingham, Ashley, and Ladderdale
 1930 ke baad america main is prakaar ke naam banane kii pratha teji se faili
 As a result of this, in almost all the modern disciplines of knowledge science, bulletins became prevalent, the US government often used indexers for every office, department, subdivision
 or to or, ab tak yah pratha itani adhik fail chuki he ki america kii praaia: prayek choti badi company, vishvavidhyalay, kalege, sanstha, pratishthan aadi puure naam kii apeksha suchakakshar ke naam se hi adhik acchhee tarah gyaat hai
 In this regard, it should also be said that an entertaining fact that the country which has most of the credit for the growth of the informers in the modern era, its name is written in English only and not as a letter
 isi prakaar uski rajdhani neuyark ke liye bhi praaia: NY likhaa jaataa he
 In America, 'college of the City of New York' has been given CCNY
 It is more convenient to say
 bharat main bhi ab shikshit samudaay main banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay puure naam kii apeksha bi
ech

 ke naam se adhik acchhee tarah janaa jaataa he
 In the countries of America and Europe, it has become such a practice that while naming any company, institution, agency etc
 establishment or publication etc
, it is also taken care that any letter from the words used in its name Create a simple, convenient index
 "ascap", "lulope" aadi isi prakaar se suchakaksharon ke udhaaharan hai
 There are also different types of bulletins for different subjects
 paashchaatya sangeet ko jab lipibaddh karnaa hota he to uske liye kuch vishisht suchakaksharon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 "TB" prevalent in medical world Now the general public is known by the word

 In mathematics, some symbols act as informers
 -, +, ̧, =, \ , aadi pratikon kaa parichay pathakon ko dena aavashyak nahin jaan padataa
 These are also a type of signature
 khagol vigyaan, jyotish vigyaan, ganitshastra, chikitsashastra, rasayanashastra or sangitshastra aadi vishyon kaa kaary to bina suchakaksharon ke chal hi nahin saktaa
 In chemistry, indicators are used to name various chemical elements
 ye suchakakshar praaia: mul angreji shabdon ke pratham akshar hi hote hai
 When the names of two elements begin with a single letter, the first two letters are used in their informants
 kuch tatwon ke liye, visheshkar jo tatv ati pracheen kaal se gyaat hai, latin naamon ke pratham aksharon kaa bhi prayog hota he
 For example, iron has an index Fe which is actually derived from the Latin word 'ferrum'
 aisa prayog kis prakaar hota he, is sambandh main vistrut jaankaree ke liye kisi angreji vishwakosh main "chemistry" shabd ke antargat adhik soochna mil sakati he
 Newspapers can also be given a lot of credit for the growth of informers in the present period
 samachaarpatron kaa ek mukhya siddhant yah hota he ki kam se kam sthaan main adhik se adhik samachar sargarbhit rup main die jaaen
 With the help of informers, news can succeed in this purpose
 vartmaan main bahut si raajnneetik partiyon evam sansthaaon ke naamon ke liye jo anadhikarik naam prachlit ho gaye hai, ve vastut: samachaarpatron kii hi dein he
 Names like NATO, SITO and Prasopa would never have been imagined by their founders, but newspapers have for their convenience "NATO" for "north Atlantic Treaty Organization" and "prasopa" for Praja Socialist Party, of the Bharatiya Janata Party He started using simple and intuitive informers like 'BJP'
 samachaarpatr raajnneetik netaaon ke naamon ke bhi suchakakshar bana lete hai

 Given the unprecedented growth of informers in the modern era, we can call them the technical language used under ordinary language
 ganit shaastra tathaa rasayanashastra ke vishay main, jinamein prayukt kiye jane vaale suchakakshar sabhi deshon main samaan rup se gyaat hai, yah baat vishesh rup se kahi ja sakati he
 Brochures of these subjects are equally used everywhere by breaking the bond of nationality, religion, varna etc
 shaikshanik jagat main degree or paathyakram praaia: suchakaksharon se hi jane jate hai
 BA, MA, P-HD Adi words have become so prevalent now that their root words "bachelor of Arts", "master of Arts", and "doctor of Philosophy" etc
 are rarely used anywhere other than certificates
 udyog, vyavsaay aadi ke kshetra main bhi suchakaksharon kii ek lambii suchi prayog main aati he
 In modern life, informants have made so much space that knowing their meaning is now considered necessary to achieve success in daily life
 thumbnail There are no definite rules for creating a signature
 kisi ek shabd yaa naam ke liye itane adhik suchakakshar banaae ja sakate hai ki kabhi-kabhi ek hi shabd ke liye kai suchakakshar prachlit ho jate hai
 Whatever it is, by studying the various types of signatures that have become prevalent in the present, we come to know some rules of making the index, which is as follows- suchakaksharon kaa saralatam rup vah he jisamen kisi naam main prayukt kiye jane vaale shabdon ke keval prathamaksharon kaa hi prayog hota he, yatha-uese, u

 Therefore, its meaning should be applied to the context, otherwise sometimes the meaning can be meaningless

 Basham, an advocate of objectivity in historiography, has suggested in one of his articles that the historian must use a large number of sources to prove his thesis, highlighting the vision required by a historian before reaching a historical decision
 lekin saath hi use ek aise barrister kii bhoomika se bachanaa bhi chahie jiskaa uddeshy keval apane paksh main faisla karwaanaa hota he
 Basham was not in favor of emphasizing everything that strengthened the historian's logic or interpreted it in the most positive light
 na hi ve duusare paksh ke sabhi saakshyon ko darkinar karne kii koshish karte the
 In fact, Basham believed in the belief that the historian's vision should be like a judge, not a barrister, a judge who reaches an objective conclusion without bias, keeping all sides in view before making his decision
 basham kaa janm 24 may, 1914 ko england main wales stoke sthit asex ke lotten naamak sthaan par hua tha

 Basham collected sources about Ajivikas by exploring Buddhist and Brahmanical works
 unki dikkat yah thi ki tab tak aajeevik sampradaay kaa itihaas bataane vaala koi bhi granth uplabdh nahin tha
 Ajivik was a preacher of materialism as well as an opponent of Buddhists and Brahmanists

 These scholars later held academic positions in various universities of the world

 Despite being the master of these two major advocates of the Marxist historiography tradition, Basham himself was not a supporter of this tradition
