 [[category: Village in Dausa District ) 'bold letter' thick alphabet title anji reddy, adhyaksh Dr
 Reddy's Laboratories Ltd
, which is traded under the name Dr
 Reddy's, is the second largest pharmaceutical company in India today
 isaki sthapana 1984 main doctor ke
 anji reddy ne kii thi
 Earlier, Dr
 Anji Reddy was working in Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, a Government of India venture
 dow reddies anekon prakaar kii dawaayein bana kar desh-videsh main vipanan karti he
 The company today has more than 190 drugs, about sixty active pharmaceutical ingredients, diagnostic equipment and intensive medical and biotechnology products
 dow reddies kii shuruyaat anya bhartiya dawa nirmaataaon ko dawaaen banaakar muhaiyaa karaane se hui, parantu sheeghra hi yah company un deshon ko dawaaen niryaat karne lagi jahaan is vyapaar se sambandhit kanoon anukool the
 For example, American companies that had to go through a lengthy and complicated license permitting process from the Food and Drug Administration for the manufacture of drugs began to buy those medicines from Dr
 Reddy's
 By the 1990s, the company's business and profits grew so much that the company began to seek direct permission from the drug regulatory agencies to set up drug factories in more favorable countries' markets
 vahaan se ye dawaaen america tathaa europe jaise kathin bazaaron main bhi bheji jane lagi
 By 2007, Dr
 Reddy's had six factories approved by the US Agency of FDA, which contained the active ingredients of pharmaceutical manufacturing
 saath hi epad kii manyata praapt aisi saat factriyaan bhi khol lee gayi jahaan marijon ke liye taiyaar dawaaen nirmit kii jaati thi
 Five of these are located in India and two in the United Kingdom, and seven are accredited by ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards for environmental protection)
 2010 main, parivaar dwaara sanchalit is company ne is baat kaa purajor khandan kiya ki vah apana jenrik vyapaar america aushadh company fizer ko bechney ja rahi he, vivaad va charchaa tab shuru hui jab dow reddy ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve cholestrol ke ilaaj main kaam aane vaali dawa autovestatin kaa jenrik rup bazaar main utaaregi
 fiser ne iskaa yah kah kar kadaa virodh kiya ki ve is dawa ko lipitor ke naam se pehle se hi bech rahe hai tathaa aisa karke dow reddy sidhe patent kanoon kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he
 Prior to this controversy, Dr
 Reddy's name was linked to the uk's famous multinational pharmaceutical company Glaxo smithkline
 saanchaa:spacing Branded medicines were highly expensive in most OECD member states, so the use of generic forms of branded medicines began to become popular in government health systems of these countries
 euke main neshnal health sarvice ke doctoron ko is aashay kii salaah desh ke swasthya vibhaag ne di, tathaa america main 1984 main iske liye ek vidheyak paas hua
 The name of this bill was 'hatch-waxman Act' or Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act
 The economic liberalization that came in the mid-1990s allowed third world countries, including India, to sell their pharmaceutical products in a tough market like the US
 1997 main america abhikaran epad ne 'para 4 filing lau' naamak ek vidheyak prastut kiya jisase jenrik dawa nirmaataaon ko branded dawa banane waalon ke viruddh patent sambandhi cese ladane main aseem sahaayta va protsaahan mila
 Till now they were obliged to wait for the expiry of these patents
 bharat kii aazaadee ke pichley 60 saalon se bhi gharelu aushadh udyog mukhyatah niyamadhaarit rahaa he
 Initially, drug companies were monopolized by multipurpose companies
 ve hi sabhi prakaar kii dawaaon kaa bharat main aayaat karti thim or unka vipanan karti thim; vishesh rup se kam keemat vaali jenrik tathaa bahut keemtee vishisht dawaaiyon kaa
 jab bhartiya sarkaar ne niryaat vastuon ke aayat par roak lagane kii prakriya chalaai to in bahuddeshiy companiyon ne nirmaataa ikaiyaan sthapit kar leen or bahumatrik dawaaiyon kaa aayaat jari rakhaa
 In the 1960s, the Government of India laid the foundations of the domestic pharmaceutical industry and promoted the government undertakings "hindustan Antibiotics Limited" and "bhartiya Aushadhi Pharmaceuticals Ltd
" to manufacture multimodal medicines
 phir bhi, bahuddeshiy companiyon kaa mahatva bana hi rahaa, kyonki unke paas technical kushalta, vittiya shakti tathaa ek bazaar se duusare bazaar tak jane ke liye navachaar kaa gun tha
 The extravagance required for basic research, the need for deep scientific knowledge, and financial capacity - were some of the obstacles that led to the Indian companies of private enterprise not achieving full success
 bhartiya patent adhinium 1970 ke lagu hone se is sthiti main parivartan aane laga
 Due to this act, the production of substances used in food and medicine has now stopped getting patents
 vidhi kaa patent sweekrut kiya jaataa tha - sweekruti kii tithi se paanch varsh ke liye yaa prarthana patr dene kii tithi se saat varsh ke liye, jo bhi kam ho
 The method was relatively easy to improve and so did the abundance of domestic manufacturers
 in nirmaataa companiyon ne aam taur par bahumatrik aushadhiyon se kaam shuru kiya or baad main sampoorn vishisht aushadh kaa nirmaan bhi karne lage
 Multipurpose companies were confused because of their parent companies' production chains; Indian producers were now able to manufacture almost everything
 utpaadan patent kaa swaittata kharch naa dene ke kaaran bhartiya utpaadakon kii nirmaan-laagat kam ho gai or ve sakushal panpane lage
 Shortly thereafter, through 'drug Price Control Order', the prices of commonly used drugs were fixed
 kam keemten niyat kiye jane ke kaaran bahuddeshiy companiyon ke swadeshi bazaar main asantosh kii ashanka se unhone nae utpaadanon par ekadam roak laga di, jisase bhartiya gharelu udyog ko or bal mil gaya
 Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act of the late 1970s, multinationals had to reduce their stake in Indian enterprises to 40%, or to maintain their equity stake of 51%, requiring certain export obligations to be met
 
 kai bahurashtriya companiyon ne aise maahaul main vyavsaay na karne kaa nirnay kiya, jo bhartiya aushadh udyog ke liye ek anya rambaan sabit hua
 In 1986, the Reddys started the branded drug practice
 ek hi varsh main reddies ne norilat ko bazaar main utaara, jo ki bharat main unka pehla brands tha
 However, due to its superior method technology, Reddys has had high success with Omez, a branded omezaprol and ulcer and reflux ozophagitis
 yah aushadh tatkaaleen bhartiya bazaar main uplabdh brands aushadhiyon se aadhi keemat par uplabdh thi
 Within a year, Reddy's became the first company to export essential ingredients of medicine to Europe
 san 1987 main reddies main parivartan armbh hua

 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki aam generik dawa va khaas rogon kii dawa ke avishkaar kii prakriya ek si thi, parantu vishesh rogon kii dawa main adhik anubhav va laabh kii prapti hoti thi
 Parts of the process such as innovation in the laboratory, creating mixes, marketing efforts, etc

 dow reddies research foundation kii sthapana 1992 main dawaaon kii khoj evam shodh ke liye hi kii gayi thi
 At first the focus of this institute was focused on the Indian version of the medicines available from the market, but later they started focusing on the invention of new medicines

 For the first 5 years after coming to the market, Reddy's was going to provide royalty to ICICI on the total sale of the drug
 ek dashak ke bheetar hi ek safal va maanya dawa company banane ke peeche reddies ke kai saahasik kadam hai
 Spending on research and development along with purchasing many big and small companies proved to be a very beneficial decision
 'bada jokhim bada laabh' kaa siddhant apanaate hue reddies ne patenton ke liye badi dawa companiyon se sidhi takkar lee
 Avoiding the loss of expenditure has been a tough challenge for the company and this has been helped by the good profit in the pharmaceutical business
 vahaan se mila dhan laabh anusandhan jaise mahatvapurn kshetron main kaam aayaa
 Another way was to buy new companies for research which was also used extensively by Reddy's

 This rule is also called 'abc rule', 'xyz rule' or 'IBF rule'
 yah niyam kai prakaar se bataaya jaataa he jo aapas main sambandhit hai, jaise- Trita is the central and esoteric doctrine of Christianity related to the inward form of God, which is called trinity
 tritv kaa arth he ki ek hi ishwar main teen vyakti hai -- pita, putr tathaa pavitra aatma 
 These three are equally eternal, infinite and omnipotent because human wisdom can reach the existence of only one almighty creator God by reason of logic
 vastut: tritv ke dharmasiddhant par isiliye vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki uski shiksha isa ne di he
 The first half of the Bible shows that monotheism was given special emphasis in Judaism
 bible ke uttarardh main isa us akeshwar ko banaae rakhte hue bhi yah shiksha dete hai ki main or param pita parameshwar ek hi hai 
 Apart from this, he tells his disciples that i will send the Holy Spirit away and will be with you in a dark way
 us pavitra aatma ko bhi vah ishwariya gunon se samanvit maanate hai
 In this way Jesus clearly states that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit exist in the same God
 baad main tryek ishwar kii is visheshta ko tritv kaa naam diya gaya he
 Christianity has tried to explain this doctrine of the Trinity with the help of Greek and Latin philosophical terms - three persons exist in the same divine nature
 teenon tatvat: ek hai
 Hence, all three have the same determination and the same intelligence
 phir bhi pita, putr or pavitra aatma main parsparik bhinnata he
 Father is not born to anyone
 putr adikaal se pita se paripurna ishwartv grahan karata he
 This origin of the son is called fertility
 pavitra aatma kii utpatti ko prajnan kehete hai
 The origin of the Holy Spirit is believed to be from both father and son and is called diffusion
 putr ke prajnan tathaa pavitra aatma se prasaran se teenon vyaktiyon kii parsparik bhinnata utpann hoti he, kintu tatvat: teenon ek hai or samaan rup se sabhi ishwariya gunon se samanvit hai
 
 shatabdiyon tak is dharmasiddhant par chintan kiya gaya he or tatvasambandhi anek dharanaon ko bhraamak tehraaya gaya he
 Trinityism, which assumes three distinct divine elements, is clearly misleading, since the existence of three independent deities is thus acknowledged
 modalism ke anusaar pita, putr or pavitra aatma ek hi ishwar ke teen pahalu hai jo sristi ke kaaran utpann ho jate hai -- pita srishtikarta he, putr hamaara uddhaar karata he tathaa pavitra aatma hamako pavitra karata he
 The church rejected this suit in the third and fourth centuries, stating that before creation, there were three persons in God
 nisea kii vishwasabha ne tritv vishyak un sabhi vyakhyaaon ko bhraamak tehraaya he jinke anusaar putr athwa pavitra aatma pita se gaun maane jate hai
 In that assembly it is clearly declared that father and son are essentially the same

 is rog se grasit rogi kii manodasha baari-baari se do vipareet avasthaaon main jaati rahati he
 One mood is called fad or mania and the other mood is depression
 sanak kii manodasha main rogi ati-ashaavadi ho saktaa he; apane bare me badi-chadhi dharna rakh saktaa he ; vyakti ati-kriyasheel ho saktaa he ; rogi sona nahin chahta yaa sone ko anaavashyak kahata he aadi
 On the other hand, in a mood of depression, the patient remains depressed; He feels tired; Feels guilty or lacks hope
 aise vyakti kaa mood jaldi-jaldi badalata he
 Whenever he feels absolutely happy, he suddenly reaches a state of depression
 khushi or dukh donon hi avasthaaen saamaanya nahin hoti he
 This state of happiness is called menic
 dridhruvi vikaar ko mukhyat: teen shreniyon main baanta gaya he- This disorder affects both men and women
 chunki yah mastishk ke prakaayon ko prabhavit karata he jisase iskaa prabhaav logon ke sochane, vyavhaar or mahasoos karne main dekha aata he
 This makes it difficult for other people to understand their situation
 saamanyat: vayaskon main ye sthiti ek hafte se lekar, ek maheene tak rahati he
 In many cases it may be less than this
 menic or depressant kii sthiti aniyamit hoti he or iskaa saathi bhi samaan nahin hota
 That is, its symptoms are not always the same

 No universally accepted scientific solution of Dridruvi mood disorder has been revealed so far
 zyaadaatar vaigyanik iske liye jaivaracinic, anuvaanshik or vaataavaran ko uttaradaayi maanate hai
 This is due to imbalance in brain chemicals
 snayusanchari main asantulan kii vajah se mood ko niyantrit karne vaala system gadabada jaataa he
 At the same time, genes are also major factors for this
 yadi kisi ke sage sambandhi ko dridhruvi vikaar he to us vyakti ko iske hone kii sambhaavna kaaphi had tak bad jaati he
 It should also not be interpreted that it will happen to him as well
 vahiin maahaul ko bhi manovaigyanik is vikaarake liye uttaradaayi maanate he
 Due to death of a person in the family, divorce of parents and many other traumatic accidents, the person becomes a victim

 dridhruvi mood vikarako pahchaan kar iskaa upachaar kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not very difficult to detect the symptoms of this disorder in adults
 bacchon or tinagers main iske lakshan vayaskon kii tarah nahin hote hai, aise main inamen lakshan pahchaanane main samasya aati he
 The current and past experiences of tngers are examined before treatment
 iske alaava parivaar ke sadsy or doston se bhi vyakti ke vyavhaar ke bare main jaankaree lee jaati he
 It is sometimes considered in teenagers as post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes it difficult to treat
 upachaar mukhyat: vyavhaarik lakshanon or sanketon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Tests are done later

 jesi james garet ke dimag main shabd "ajaks" tab aayaa jab ve naha rahe the, us samay ve ek graahak ke liye praudyogikiyon ke pratinidhitiv ke liye ek sankshipt rup kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahe the
 April 5, 2006 The World Wide Web Consortium released the first draft statement for the object to create an official web standard
 shabd ajaks web praudyogikiyon ke k bade samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jinka upyog ek aise web anuprayog ke kriyanvayan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo prishthbhumi main ek sarwar ke saath sanchaar karata he, is dauraan yah pej kii vartmaan sthiti main koi hastkshep nahin karata he
 In the article where the word Ajax was given, Jesse James Garrett clarified that the following technologies are needed: XML or XSLT
 Since then, there have been many developments in the definition of the word Ajax and the technologies used in the Ajax application
 vishesh rup se yah note kiya gaya he ki: Other languages such as vbscript also deserve the required functionality
 haalankijawa script ajaks programing ke liye sabase lokapriy bhashaa he, kyonki yah adhikansh aadhunik web brouzars ke saath sangat he or unamem shaamil he
 Classical Ajax involves the writing of ad hoc javascript on the client
 ek aasaan or krudar vikalp kaa upyog maanak java script libraries ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo aanshik rup se pej ko apadet karte hai, jaise asp
net kaa apadet panel
 upkaran jaise Echo2 or ZK keval maanak java script libraries kaa upyog karte hue sarwar se ek pej ke fine grand niyantran ko sakasham banataa he
 Material is reloaded on every request, using the traditional methods used
 haalanki, ajaks kaa upyog karte hue, ek web anuprayog keval us saamagree kii request karata he jise apadet kiye jane kii zaroorat hoti he, is prakaar se bandwidth ke upyog or lod ke samay ko bahut adhik kam karata he
 Users make applications faster and more responsive, even when the application has not changed on the server side
 aas paas ke kaaryon main adrishy iframes kaa upyog shaamil he, jo brouzar kii history main parivartan karte hai or URL ke ankar hisse main parivartan karte hai jab ajaks chal rahaa hota he or parivartanon ke liye iskaa niyantran karata he
 Solutions to this problem exist, many of which use the URL fragment identifier to keep track of it and allow the user to return to the application at a given stage
 screen pathakon jo ajaks kaa upyog karne main sakasham he vah gatik rup se utpann saamagree ko thik prakaar se padhne main aksham ho saktaa he
 The only way to make the user work is to go back to the non-javascript method
 This can be done by creating a fixed link, and the forms can be resolved properly and they do not depend only on Ajax
 javascript main iske baad "ritern falls' ke saath form jamaa karne kii prakriya ko galat kiya ja saktaa he
 Developers familiar with other web technologies should learn coding methods and new tests for writing secure Ajax applications

 Inside these chromosomes, like DNA beads, some DNA chemical units are known as genes

 The basic purpose of this science is to study the ways of heredity, that is, how a child resembles or differs from its parents

 For example, how a creature will grow will determine its heredity

 Almost all creatures display signs of their parents or sometimes of Baba, Dadi or their previous generation

 This type of changes or differences has many causes
 jeevon kaa parivardhan tathaa uske baad kaa jivan unke parivesh par bhi nirbhar karata he
 The surroundings of beings are extremely complex; Under this, all the substances, forces and other living beings of the organism are contained, which continue to affect their life

 In 1911, Johansen established a distinction between the external characteristics of animals and the pituitary traits
 jeevon ke bahm lakshan unke parivardhan ke saath-saath parivartit hote rahete hai, jaise jeevon kii bhrunavastha, shishav, yauvan tathaa vriddhavastha main paryaapt shaareerik vibhed drushtigochar hota he
 In contrast, their ancestral traits or characteristics are stable and unchangeable
 kisi bhi jeev ke pitraagat lakshan or parivesh kii antakriyaaon ke falswaroop uski vruddhi or parivardhan hota he
 Therefore, the putative traits determine the 'norms of response' of organisms, that is, the manner of their response to the environment

 He also stated that within the chromosomes, these genes are arranged in a defined sequence, due to which it is possible to make a genetic picture of them

 Many scientists believe that genetic study of humans is not a simple task
 iskaa kaaran yah batalaaya jaataa he ki manushya kii santan ke janm main lagbhag 10 maas lag jate hai or ise purna vayask hone main kam se kam 20 varsh lagate hai
 Therefore, genetic study of humans is complicated due to the time it takes 20,22 years to study only one generation
 iske saath hi manushya ko ek baar main saadharantaya ek hi baccha utpann hota he, isse bhi adhyayan main kathinaayee hoti he
 Despite these difficulties, the study of external structure of human body, diseases, their symptoms and causes etc
 is simple

 Linen with high absorption capacity and conductive heat makes clothes feel cold on touching
