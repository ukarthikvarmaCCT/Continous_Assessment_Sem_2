 greek sahitya ke nirmaan main in chaar pradeshik bhashaaon kaa gauravpurn yoga rahaa he
 Greek poetry begins with Homer's epics - "iliad" and "odyssey" and it would not be inappropriate to call him Valmiki in his literature
 antar keval itnaa hi he ki homer greek kavy ke janmdata nahin the kyonki unke pehle bhi ek lokapriy kavy parampara thi, jisase ve prabhavit hue or jiske bikhare hue tatwon ko ekatra aaklit kar unhone apane mahakavyon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Scholars believe that the epics of Homer developed slowly and many people have been responsible for their creation

 Homer was presumably born about 900 years before Christ at a place called Ismarna in Asia Minor

 The eighth century BC is considered an era of political change in the history of Greece, with the decline of the state and the rise of democracy
 unaniyon ke liye yah gahan chintan kaa samay tha jiskaa prabhaav kavy sahitya main pratibimbit he
 It was under these conditions that a new poetical form emerged, named "elegy"
 aajkal "eliji" main ve kavitaayen abhihit kii jaati hai jo mritatmaon ke shok se sambandhit ho athwa jinamein jivan kii kshanbhangurta athwa ateet vaibhav kii nashvarata par bhavpurn prakaash daalaa gaya ho
 But in ancient Greece in addition to this, other topical themes were included in the Elegies, in such poems the poet's personal expressions were sung on festive occasions such as war, love, politics and philosophical sermons in front of the audience with the rhythm of the flute
 in kaviyon kii style mahakavyon se prabhavit hote hue bhi unase bhinn thi

 This aspect of public life is reflected in the songs of Alkyas

 His poems are of love letters sent to Sakhis

 The poetess of Aflatun herself had sung in his memory - almost all the works of Saafi are fragmented
 adhiktar ye mistra kii balukabhumi se praapt hui
 The Syrian Greeks developed a lyrical narrative after the 12th century BCE whose significance was public and were sung in a trained chorus form on the sacred conquests and religious occasions of the country and nation or city
 inamen prasiddh "kores od" hai, jahaan chhandon kii jatilta, style kaa oj tathaa bhaavon kii garima sundar triveni kaa sanchaaran karti hai
 The most well-known name in this area is Pindar, whose "aad", embellished with impressive and distinguished but extraordinary terminology, is still alive today

 The climax of Greek literature is found in plays whose center was Athens and the main language was "etik"
 greek naatak saarvajaneen jivan se sambandhit rahe or unamem mukhya bhaavana tathaa prerana dharmik thi
 The Greek grief originated with the kirtans and amodes held in honor of Dionysus, the god of Sura, in which priests roamed while singing with a goat's face
 in geeton ko "ditharaev" kehete the
 This later took the form of drama when the religious chorus was divided into two parts - the messenger of the deity on one side and his priest on the other
 yahi doot naatak kaa pratham paatr mana jaataa he
 By the beginning of the fifth century BC, the form of Greek drama had become well-formed and the three main pillars of the grief drama, the Ischilas, the Safocleys and the Europeans, tried to develop it during this period
 iskilas greek du:khant naatak ke pita maane jate hai
 He was a soldier poet, and his plays are accompanied by an oozing style of imagination and high patriotism and unwavering religious faith
 pradhanta kavyapaksh kii he or naatakeey tatv gaun he
 His plays related to Aristees and Primethys are particularly famous
 greek du:khant ke vikaas main kendriya sthaan iskilas ke safal pratidwandvi sifoklis kaa he, jinhone tisare paatr kaa samavesh kar naatakeey tatwon, visheshkar samvaad kaa dayera vistrut kiya
 His plays have an artistic harmony with human and supernatural elements, and his characters, such as Oedipus and Etigon, are, despite their extraordinary personality, full of human characteristics
 vaataavaran ucch vichaaron se prerit he
 The decline of ancient beliefs and the rise of modern attitudes are clearly mentioned in the plays of Euripidies
 dharmik shraddha ke sthaan par naastikta, adarshavaad ke sthaan par yatharthwaad, asaadhaaran paatro ke sthaan par saadhaaran paatr pathakon ke samaksh aate hai
 He was a foster of Karunaras and his dialogues consist of complex arguments
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is ardhshatabdi ke alpakaal main iskilas ne 70, sofoklis ne 113 or urapidij ne 92 naatakon kaa nirmaan kiya jinamein adhikansh lupt ho gaye
 The Greek joyous drama also originated with the worship of the god Dionysus, but this worship was not held in the winter but in the spring, and the procession of priests displayed the same arrogance and vulgarity as often seen on the occasion of Holi in India
 Comes in sukhaant naatak ke vikaas main dirian logon kaa mahatvapurn yoga rahaa, parantu iskaa utkarsh to etika se hi sambandhit he kyonki pracheen greek sukhaant naatak ke prabal pravartak aristophanij kaa kaaryakshetra to athens hi rahaa
 This fearless playwright created such melodious plays from 427 BCE to 40 years in which there are astonishing combination of the flight of free imagination with the melody of poetry, the intensity of inspection and the ingenuity of satire
 in sukhantaan main, "pakshi", "bhek", "megh", "raaten" or praaia: vyaktiyon par prahaar kiya gaya he
 Many of these include the intense derision of Socrates and his disciples' political and justice-related narratives, the politics of the perikalese, and his concubine, Aspagia
 kai sthanon par hasyaras ashleelata se pankil ho uthaa he
 Ancient pleasant dramas culminated in the medieval happy dramas of Greece, in which, instead of barbarism and personal satire, there was encouragement to the graceful farce whose characters were often symbols of various human classes and errors
 is naveen evam sukhaant naatak ke sajiv udhaaharan "platas" tathaa "terence" ke roman naatakon main milte hai
 Minander was its famous Greek promoter
 in sukhaant naatakon main nimnakoti kaa vaasanatv pradhan he
 Greek prose originated behind the verse, just like other literatures of the world
 isa purv paanchavin shatabdi ke madhya main greek gadhy tathaa padya ke kshetra ek duusare se alag hone lage or bahut se vichaaron kaa abhivyanjan gadhy ke madhyam se hone laga
 Famous Greek historians, Herodotus, Thucydidies and Xenophon Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus, Aflatun and Aristotle, and Greek eloquents and philosophers were heavily involved in the creation of artistic prose
 shastriyon main mukhya sthaan sophistaan kaa tha jo athens main vaktaaon kaa prashikshan karte the or apane kavy tathaa sangitamay gadhybhashanon se asaty ke upar satya kaa mulammaa lagaakar logon ko mugdh kiya karte the
 Aflatun protested against his harmful effects, and after that Aristotle made a scientific interpretation of this scripture and threw light on different styles of prose that his explanation is considered authentic till date
 aflatoon tathaa unke shishy arestu darshanik hone ke saath hi sahityasameekshak bhi the
 The talent of both was versatile
 parantu plato kii gadhyshailee saahitiyik he or usamen yathasthaan kavitv kaa sundar put he arestu kaa gadhy neeras vaigyanik kaa he jisamen kalapaksh gaun he vichaarpaksh mukhya
 Review literature of Europe for centuries considered Aristotle's poetry as sacred as the Bible
 arestu ke shishy theophrestras apni gadhyrachana "kairactors" ke liye prasiddh hai
 In the early third century BCE, Greek literature began to move towards the end of the period
 sikandar ke pita philip dwitiya ne unani swatantra rashtron kii satta par kutharaghaat kiya or sikandar ne swayan apni vishwavijay kii ugantarkari yatra main unani sahitya tathaa samskruti ko saarvbhaum banane kaa sakriy prayaas kiya
 Thus some centers were built outside Greece where the study of Greek language and literature began to be conducted in a new way but with great enthusiasm
 in kendron main pramukh mishra kii rajdhani alekjandria thi jahaan par unani sahitya, darshan tathaa vigyaan ke hastlikhit granthon kaa ek vishaal pustkaalay ban gaya jiskaa vinaash isa purv pehali sadi main general antoni ke samay hua
 The authors and scholars of this new center were influenced and inspired by the writers of Greece and their work was especially appreciated in the field of science
 parantu sahitya kshetra main srujanaatmak pratibha kaa sthaan aalochana tathaa vyakaran or vyakhya sahitya ne le liya
 As a result, along with the interpretation of old literature, it became possible to preserve the characteristics of many texts
 is kaal kii kavita main naveen tatwon kaa vikaas spasht he parantu use saath hi yah bhi prakat he ki kavita kaa dayera sankuchit ho gaya or kavita janata ke liye nahin visheshgyon ke liye likhi jane lagi
 The style became artificial and cumbersome, and in word-of-mouth also stood the boast of erudition
 kaviyon main mukhya naam he theocretas kaa jo dehati jivan sambandhi gochaaran sahitya ke strashta maane jate hai or apolonius tathaa kalimax kaa vishesh sambandh kramash: mahakavy or footkar geetkavy, jaise "eliji" or "evigraamon" se he
 Around the second century BCE, the Roman invaders came to dominate the country of Greece, but they accepted the importance of Greek literature and philosophy, and decided to be inspired by them to flourish their national literature
 yahi kaaran he ki roman samrajya ke vividh bhaagon main unani bhashaa kaa prachaar tha or isi bhashaa ke madhyam se sahitya ke vibhinn kshetron main prasiddh granthon kaa nirmaan ho rahaa tha
 The main place in this literature is prose which is the review
 samikshakon main sarvshereshth "lanzinus" he jiskaa prasiddh kintu apurna granth "shaleen ke vishay main" pracheen samiksha sahitya main aflatoon tathaa arestu ke granthon kaa samakaksh mana jaataa he
 This book discusses the decency of literature and mentions hundreds of works of Greece and Rome as examples
 sameekshak kaa sahitya prempragadh he or gadhy style main kavyachamatkaar tathaa ospurn shabdavinyason kii bharmaar he
 Another famous and influential prose writer of this period is Plutarch, who was born in the high clan of Baytia and gained considerable fame by living in Rome
 kanya kii akaal mrityu se prerit ho inhone "consolation" kii rachana kii jo kalantar main lokapriy hui
 Plutarch was a famous philosopher and a devotee of "apollo" and the last phase of his life was spent in literary service and devarchan
 inke lekhon tathaa bhaashanon kaa sangrah "morelia" ke naam se prasiddh he
 Plutarch's best and most eminent treatise is a parallel character of the Greeks and Romans, in which he proves his claim that parallel examples of each Roman are available in Greek history
 yah rachana sansar ke prasiddh granthon main gini jaati he or isamen aitihaasik tatv gaun hote hue bhi mahatvapurn he, parantu usase adhik mahatvapurn he charitrachitran tathaa rochak kahani kii vah kala jisane ise apane kshetra kaa amuly ratna bana diya he
 In this era, Greek prose literature created certain novels which are known as romance because their main aim is not to present the real form of life and the reality has died down by imagination and exaggeration and surprising events
 in romance kritiyon main jaise "tir kaa apolonius", dafnes tathaa clon yaa pastoralia-prem tathaa asaadhaaran ghatnachakra hi centresthal he
 Primody of the hero and heroine, then their separation and then wandering from there to the hurt of circumstances, finally reuniting and attaining unity in love is basically the essence of the main plot of these texts
 is yug kii greek kavita main moulikta tathaa sajivta kaa abhaas he or adhikansh kavyasevi saadhaaran shrenee ke hai
 But the mention of Lucian E
 will be of importance in this direction
 greek kavy main nae jivan kaa usne sanchaar kiya
 Lucian was born in Syria and Greek was not his mother tongue, but he studied the language with such love and dedication that it became his mother tongue
 isaki vishesh rujhaan darshan kii ore thi jisase prerit hokar usne apane jivan ke sunahale kaal 40 varsh kii avasthaa main athens ko kuch samay ke liye apana nivasasthaan banaaya tha
 But the philosophers' seriousness was against his temperamental fickleness, as a result of which he activated his writings in the rebuttal of contemporary philosophical fetters
 uski rachanaaon main "faloris" tathaa "mritkon kaa dialaag" vishesh ullekhneey hai
 The dialogue is full of satirical pictures and presents commentary on the bizarre exploits of mankind and provides a good life tableau of the descendants of hell
 in sabhi rachanaaon main dhanikon ke vyavhaar tathaa vicharon ke prati lekhak kii ghrinaa tathaa kadi aalochana swat: pramaan he
 Thus Lucian's genius was inspired by satirical bitterness and his satire was not limited to contemporary life
 unhone pracheen tathaa samakaleen sabhi dharmik andolanon kii kadi aalochana kii ore devataaon ke dialags tathaa seriyak devi ke prati jaisi rachanaaon main devataaon tathaa unke chamatkaaron kii bhi kaaphi khilli udayi
 In this way, Lucian was not only representative of the old trend of Greece but was representative of all its literature
 lesian ke saath hi clasical greek bhashaa kaa avsaan ho jaataa he or ek mishrit bhashaa uskaa sthaan grahan karnaa aarambh karti he kyonki uski mukhya prerana kaa kshetra hi badal jaataa he
 Along with Christianity, a new inspiration came into being in the Greek language
 greek carch tathaa uske aadhin bahari kendron ke netaaon tathaa santon ne isi bhashaa ke madhyam se dharmik tathaa aadhyatmik samasyaon tathaa bhaawanaaon kaa vivechan tathaa vishleshan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Some of the religious works are explanatory and didactic, such as "the Famous Papers of Sant Pal" and some are related to order and organization, such as "first Epsil of Clement", but are mostly explanatory, such as "epsil of Barnavas"
 in rachanaaon main sahitya tatv gaun hai, parantu alekjandria ke prasiddh carch-pita klement tathaa origen ke gambhir lekh vichaargarima ke saath hi saath saahitiyik style ke bhi prabhaavshaalee udhaaharan hai
 Historically the most famous book is "ecclesiastical History" written by Czera, which is the authentic text of the then church history
 madhyayugin isai lekhakon ne greek bhashaa tathaa style ke madhyam se pracheen unani darshan tathaa dharm sambandhi mul tatwon kaa saamanjasy apane nae tathaa pragatisheel dharm se sthapit karne kaa kram aarambh kiya
 As a result, many elements of the old style were reborn and the main doctrines of Aflatun and Aristotle found a respectable place in Christian theology
 is nai vichaardhaara ke prabal samarthak "bizantium" ke dharmik lekhak the jo greek sahitya tathaa darshan se purnataya anupranit the
 The same religious center encouraged songs that were sung on various occasions of worship and festivals in the church and are still known as "liturgi" and "snow"
 ye geetkavy puraani chhandaparampara ko chhodkar ek nai chand pranali kaa anusaran karte hai or inke bahm roopon main ascharyajanak bhinnata he
 But the language is so flexible that it becomes an appropriate tool for all those different forms without any special effort
 in geetkaavyon kaa sarvottam vikaas un shrinkhalabaddh dharmik geeton main hua jo "canan" naam se prasiddh hai or jinke sarvshereshth pravartak damishq ke sant jon the
 Such poems have been written for centuries and words and music are often interwoven in them
 iske saath hi ek or nai sahityadhara kaa aavirbhaav hua jiskaa sambandh isai santon ke jivan tathaa chamatkaaron se tha
 It is a blend of truth and imagination, and their authors seem to engage in the love and faith of moral and religious elements in place of worldly entertainment in the hearts of readers, adopting stylistic and thrilling narratives of medieval romances
 in lokapriy granthon kaa udgam sthaan mistra ke sat aathani kii "jeevanakatha" he jiske lekhak chauthi shatabdi ke sant athnasius maane jate hai
 The most popular parts of modern Greek literature are poetry, articles and poetry which were written in the common language
 vah bhashaa jo clasical ke vipareet "demotic greek" ke naam se prasiddh he
 Most of them fall under the category of folklore and are reflections of the ups and downs of folklore
 in geeton kii mukhya prerana loukik he or inke padhane se maharani elizabeth pratham ke swarnyug main prachlit un geetikavyon kaa samaran ho aata he jinamein javaani kii umang, prakrutiprem tathaa sura sundari main utkar lipsaa ke saath hi madhur pidaa bhi he jo bhautik sukh saundarya kii kshanbhangurta se aavirbhoot hoti he
 There are also some poems in this tradition whose importance is historical and the originals of the then accidents; For example, we can take those folk songs that mourn the downfall of Kustuntunia and express satisfaction over the courage and bravery of its defenders
 is prachur kavyasahitya ke saath lekhakon kaa vyaktigat sambandh nahin ke baraabar he
 It reflects the collective thoughts and feelings of the entire caste, hailed with folklore
 iske atirikt aadhunik greek sahitya kaa anya prasiddh ang vah he jisapar pashchimi europe kii chhap gahari he
 This annexation of the east-west took place during the medieval crusades when the religious leaders of the countries of France, Italy, etc
 advanced towards the East in opposition to the Turks
 isi ke falswaroop prem tathaa saahasik kaary se sambandhit un romaason kaa janm hua jo madhyakaalin french upanyaason se prerit hai or jinka madhyam demautik greek he
 In the 17th century, this combination of two castes proved to be most meaningful in the famous cities of Crete, resulting in the emergence of a new type of drama which was inspired by Italian theater
 is sahitya main sarvaprasiddh naam kornaros kaa he jo naam se italian hai parantu bhashaa jinaki unani he
 In his popular novel called "rotocritus", he succeeded in giving a modern twist to medieval romance
 kreet main is nae sahitya kaa utkarshkaal keval 50 varsh tak tha kyonki 1669 i

 The late 18th century was a period of struggle for Greece's political awakening
 is jagritikaal main rashtrabhasha kaa prashn bhi vichaarneey tha
 Classical Greek, the pure language of the Vagantium, which was the language of the Church, and Demotic Greek, which was popular - was to form the national language using one of these as the basis
 is sangharsh main kai asafal prayaason ke pashchaat ant main lokprachlit bhashaa kii vijay hui or is vijay kaa mukhya shrey aadhunik greece ke sarvshereshth kavi "deonisiis ceylomons" kii hai, jinhone yah siddh kar diya ki bhashaa hi ucch koti kaa safal madhyam ho sakati he
 By the beginning of the 20th century, poetry and prose were written through this medium, which led to the substantial development and refinement of this language
 is shatabdi ke madhya tathaa uttarardh main kavy tathaa upanyaas greek sahitya ke vishisht ang rahe hai
 In this way, the history of Greek literature and language has remained virtually intact from a millennium BC to the present day, although the repetition of its ancient glory was never possible in later ages

 The third type of change is not so serious
 anuvanshiki vaigyanikon ne utparivartan ke nimnlikhit bhed batalaaye hai:-- 1
 gene or point mutation 2
 aropit utparivartan a mutation is defined as saying that mutation is the name of a dynamic chemical change in the genetic material of a species
 ye parivartan gunasutron kii sanrachana tathaa sankhya main utpann hote hai
 Therefore, the change in molecular structure of a gene from this point of view is called "gene mutation"
 kintu, jab is prakaar ke parivartan gunasutra ke kisi binduvishesh yaa khandwishesh main dikhalaai denge to unhen "bindu utparivartan" kahenge
 In fact, there is no special distinction between these two types of changes, so these two terms are mentioned in synonymous forms
 utparivartan taatkaalik hote hai, at: inhen "taatkaalik utparivartan" bhi kehete hai
 The point mutations are very subtle and do not affect the entire organism

 Effective mutations can be readily detected in chromosomes or genes located in their carrier cells
 kintu aise utparivartan supt utparivartanon kii tulana main kam hi drushtigochar hote hai
 But as far as mutations in humans are concerned, such mutations have been shown to be mostly effective

 Once ineffective ineffective mutations occur, they are not visible for many generations
 kintu yahi utparivartan yadi lingasahalagn hote hai, to agali peedi main hi prabhavi ho jate hai
 Mortal mutations are considered mostly ineffective or dormant
 pranaghatak utparivartan yadi janankoshika main hi jate hai, to bhavi santati vishamayugmi hogi
 If such mutations occur in egg laying animals, then about 1 in heterozygous parents

 Scientists have found through experiments that there are three types of ambient effects on mutations, by temperature, by certain chemicals and by irradiation
 tapakram- utparivartan par tapakram kaa kya prabhaav padataa he, isapar adhiktar prayog kadli makkhi, drosophila, ko hi lekar kiye gaye hai
 In a similar experiment, when the sex-linked ineffective lethal genes were studied, it was found that 14 ° Cg
 But 0
087 percent, 22 degree centigrade
 But 0
188 percent and 28 degree centigrade
 But 0
325 percent of lethal genes were generated
 isse ek baat yah spasht hoti he ki tapakram main yadi 10 degree kii bhi vruddhi ho jaati he to utparivartan kii dar main dooni athwa tiguni vruddhi ho jaati he
 In this context, it is also interesting to note that mutation can be effected not only by an increase in temperature , but also by extreme reduction
 drosophila milenogaster ke teen dinon ke dimbhon ko -6 degree taap par rakhane par dekha gaya ki 25 se 40 minute ke bheetar inke eks tathaa dwitiya gunasutron main ghaatak utparivartan kii dar tinguni ho gai
 Astu, it is strange that extreme increase in cold and heat has almost the same effect

 In addition to mustard smoke, several paraxides, paralene, permengate, urethane, caffeine, etc
 have also been proven to increase the mutation rate

 The second deficiency was also found in them that their effect is visible only at particular stages of formulation or in particular directions of change
 isi prakaar kuch rasayan keval nar ko har prabhavit kar pate hai, maadaa ko nahin
 The reason for this has been stated that until a chemical penetrates inside the nucleus of the cell, its effect will be doubtful; Secondly, if the cytoplasm of the external chemical is neutralized, then it will not have any effect

 Their power is very slow and low
 jab tak inhen vishesh rasayanon se sanlagn nahin kiya jaataa, tab tak inaki kaaryakshmata hin hi rahati he
 These rays have the same effect as X-rays and they also produce both gene mutation and chromosomal aberration
 inkaarak vikiran ke falswaroop gunasutron main yadi ekal bhang hota he, to utakon kaa sookshm adhyayan aavashyak hoga
 But, when there is a double breakdown and that too in the same chromosome, when they will cause inferiority and inversion
 yahi doharaa bhang yadi asamjaat gunasutron main hota he to sthanantaran utpann hoga
 The importance of mutations can have the following aspects: udvikasiya mahatv - aarambh main hi hamane dekha he ki sristi ke jeevajgat main vividhta drushtigochar hoti he
 The evolutionary theory holds that all of this visible molecule is made great
 arthath prayek mahaan kii ikai koi na koi anu he
 The same molecule takes on a form of one to two, two to four, eight, sixteen and infinite and passes through a period of unspeakable and unimaginable multiplications
 jeevajgat kii vividhta ke sambandh main koi vyavasthit vyakhya uplabdh nahin he, tathaapi is sambandh main ab tak jo kuch kaha suna gaya he, uskaa saransh is prakaar he- In the primitive stages of life, the Earth's atmosphere was uncertain and the geographical environment was not as it is today

 The shape, size, color, etc

 Only those creatures who could survive were strong
 vayumandaleey prabhaav shaktishaalee hone ke kaaran komal jeevon ke gunasutron main parivartan ho janaa saamaanya baat rahi hogi
 This would have led to the development of new types of animals
 yahi kaaran he ki jis teji se ve faile usee gati se samaapt hote gaye
 His mark, the proof of his power, was reduced to fossils
 gunasutron main parivartan ke falswaroop jantukulon main hi nahin, spishiz tak main vividhta aa gai
 This diversity is present till date and now it is less likely to change
 kaaran yah he ki aaj kaa prakritik paryaavaran paryaapt dooshit ho gaya he or bhanti bhanti ke takneekee tathaa vaigyaniki avishkaron dwaara manushya prakruti ko apni cheri banaata ja rahaa he
 This is why artificial means have to be used for mutation

 One such method of hybridization for mutation is today accessible to scientists, which they are being used indiscriminately
 iskaa parinaam aage kya hoga, yah to abhi bhavishya ke garbh main he
 What population genetics will be able to do for the welfare of humans, it cannot be said before now

 It is believed that initially the area of joshimath was in the sea and when the mountains emerged here, it became the taphobhumi of Narasimharupi Lord Vishnu
 kimbadanti main daanav hiranyakashyapu tathaa uske putr prahlaad kii katha he
 Hiranyakashipu had the boon that he could not be killed by any woman or man, day or night, indoors or outdoors or by the use of any weapon
 isane use ahamkaari bana diya or vah apane ko bhagwaan maanane laga
 He prohibited the worship of Vishnu in his kingdom
 prahlaad, bhagwaan vishnu kaa upaask tha or yatnaa evam sajaa ke baavjood vah vishnu kii puja karata rahaa
 Enraged, Hiranyakashipu asked his sister Holika to go into the burning fire with Prahlad on her lap as Holika had a boon that she would not burn in the fire
 prahlaad ko kuch bhi nahi hua or holikaa jalakar raakh ho gayi
 In the last attempt Hiranyakashipu heated an iron pillar to red and asked Prahlad to embrace it
 ek baar phir bhagwaan vishnu prahlaad ko ubaarane aa gayi
 Lord Vishnu appeared in the form of Narasimha from the pillar and killed Hiranyakashipu with his claws as a human being, half a human, half an animal at Godhuli Bela
 kaha jaataa he ki is avasar par narsingh kaa krodh itnaa prabal tha ki hiranyakashyapu ko maar daalane ke baad bhi kai dinon tak ve krodhit rahe
 Finally, Bhagwati Lakshmi sought help from Prahlada and he kept on chanting Lord Vishnu until he calmed down
 aaj unhen joshimath ke sarvottam mandir main shant swaroop main dekha ja saktaa he
 Another mystery related to Narasimha temple is described in Kedarkhand of Skanda Purana
 iske anusaar shaaligram kii kalai din par din patali hoti ja rahi he
 When it falls apart from the body, then all the paths of Badrinath will be closed forever due to the collision of the male and Narayan mountains
 tab bhagwaan vishnu kii puja bhavishya badri main hogi jo tapovana se ek kilometre dur joshimath ke nikat he
 a legend emerging from this legend is that a descendant of Vasudeva, the early king of the region, went to the forest for hunting one day and in his absence Lord Vishnu Narasimha came there in human form and asked for food from the queen
 rani ne unhen khaane ko kaaphi kuch diya tathaa khaane ke baad ve vahaan raja ke bistar par so gayi
 When the king returned from hunting, he saw a stranger sleeping on his bed
 usne apni talwaar uthaayi or uski baanh par aghat kiya, parantu vahaan se rakt ke badale doodh bah niklaa
 Then Lord Vishnu appeared and told the king that he should leave Joshimath to make atonement for the trauma and settle his house in Katyur
 unhone kaha ki jo aghat unhen usne diya he vah mandir main unki murti par rahegaa or jis din vah gir jaayegaa, us din raja ke vansh kaa ant ho jaayegaa

 Sulfates are common or neutral salts, such as normal sodium sulfate or acidic sodium bisulfate
 amleey isliye ki isamen ab bhi ek hydrogen rahata he, jo ksharakon se pratisthapit ho saktaa he
 Sulphates are formed by the action of acids on metals, metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or other salts
 adhikansh sulphate jalaviley hote hai
 Only calcium, barium, strontium, and sis salts are insoluble or very soluble in water
 anek lavan audyogic mahatv ke hai
 Barium and sis sulfate are used as pigments, sodium sulfate is used in paper manufacture, copper sulfate as a pesticide, and calcium sulfate as a plaster of Paris
 sis or ispaat par sandra amla kii koi kriya nahin hoti
 Therefore, Sis and steel vessels are used in the manufacture of acids and for keeping acids
 prayogshaalaon main nimnaankit teen ritiyon se alp maatra main gandhakaml taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he : By dissolving sulfur trixide in water, hydrogen paroxide tathaa sulfur dioxide kii sidhi kriya se- By the slow oxidation of a solution of sulfuric acid in the air
 audyogic str par sis-kaksh-vidhi tathaa sansparsh vidhi se amla kaa utpaadan hota he
 In the contact method, sulfur dioxide is first formed by the combustion of sulfur, such as sulfur or iron sulfide, and is converted into sulfur dioxide by the oxygenation of air in the presence of a platinum metallic asbestos catalyst, which dissolves in water to form sulfur
 is vidhi main jal kii upasthiti main nitric amla dwaara sulfur dioxide ke oxikaran se amla banataa he
 This action takes place in large Sis chambers, hence its name is 'sis-chamber-method'
 is vidhi kaa upyog baari maatra main salphuric amla banane ke liye hota tha, kintu isaki kuch kamiyaan hai jiske kaaran ab iskaa sthaan sansparsh prakram ne le liya he
 The first factory to manufacture Gandhakamal on a large scale was established in 1740 AD in Richmond near London by a scientist named Ward
 nirmaan ke liye gandhak tathaa shore ke mishran ko lohe ke paatr main garam kiya jaataa tha or amla ke vaashp ko kaanch ke paatro main jinamein jal bharaa rahata tha, ekatra kiya jaataa tha
 The dilute acid obtained in this way was concentrated in glass containers above the sand boiler
 kuch samay pashchaat sheeghra tuutanevaale kaanch ke paatro ke sthaan par chah foot chaude sis kakshon kaa prayog hone laga
 In 1810, the use of modern seashell method started by the hard work of a scientist named Holker
 1818 i
 se gandhak dwizarkik kii prapti ke liye kachche maal gandhak ke sthaan par pirietiess naamak khanij kaa prayog hone laga
 The Sise-chamber method was modernized by the development of the gay-lupac Pillar in 1827 AD and the Globar Pillar in 1859 AD
 yahan nitrogen ke oxide, gandhak dwizarkik tathaa vaayu ko kaksh main pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 Such a gas mixture is injected into the 25-foot-high Glover column from below
 is stambh main upar se ge-lusac stambh kaa gandhakaml tathaa nitrosil gandhakaml kaa mishran tapakataa he
 The gas mixture enters the sis chamber after exiting the column
 saadharantaya sis kaksh teen rahete hai
 Here steam also enters the chamber
 gas mishran or bhaap ke bich kriya hokar, gandhakaml banakar, kaksh ke pende main ikattha hota he
 The residual gases now enter the gay-lussac column
 inamen pradhanthya nitrogen ke oxide rahete hai
 The gay-lussac column is filled with pieces of coke or stone
 usamen upar se gandhakaml tapakataa he or rukaawat ke kaaran dhire-dhire girakar, nitrogen ke oxidon ko avashoshit kar, nitrosil gandhakaml banataa he or glover stambh main prayukt hota he
 In this way, the loss of nitrogen oxides is saved
 sis kaksh se praapt amla ashuddh hota he
 The impurities contain arsonic, nitrogen oxides and some salts
 aisa amla pradhanthya urvarak ke nirmaan main prayukt hota he
 Pure acid is not necessary for this
 aisa amla sasta hota he
 Another method of manufacturing sulfur acid is the contact method
 is vidhi se praapt amla adhik shuddh or sandra hota he
 It was developed by a scientist named Nitz in 1889–90 AD
 germany kii badishche anilin and soda fabric company ne is vidhi se sarvapratham amla taiyaar kiya, at: ise badishche vidhi, athwa badishche prakram bhi kehete hai
 Most of the world's sulfuricides are manufactured nowadays by contact method
 isse kisi bhi sandran kaa amla praapt ho saktaa he
 In this method, sulfur is obtained by burning sulfur, or by acquiring pyrites
 ise vaayu ke saath milakar utprerak par le laayaa jaataa he, jahaan gandhak dwizarkik vaayu ke oxigen se sanyukt hokar gandhak trioxide banataa he
 "oleum" is obtained by absorbing sulfur trioxide into the concentrated sulfur
 olium kii jal ke saath kriya se vaanchit sandratha ke amla ko praapt kiya jaataa he
 First microdivided platinum was used as a catalyst
 yah bahut mahanga padataa tha
 When vanadium pentoxide is used in place of platinum, it is much cheaper than platinum
 utprerak kii kriyasheeltaa kam na ho jaae, iske liye aavashyak he ki sulfur dioxide arsenic, raakh tathaa dhul kanon se bilkul mukt ho
 Hence, the sulfur is arranged for filtering the bifurcation and it is passed through such substances in which arsenic is completely released
 yadi gas ko shuddh na kar liya jaae, to utprerak kii kaaryashiltaa jald nasht ho sakati he
 The gases that enter the catalytic chamber contain sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen
 urdhwadhar paatro main utprerak rakhaa rahata he
 The gas released there is absorbed into the concentrated sulfuric acid
 isse olium praapt hota he
 Up to 40 percent more sulfur in the oleum can be absorbed in addition to 100 per cent of sulfur
 aavashyak maatra main pani daalkar, isse vaanchit sandratha kaa amla praapt kar sakate hai
 Several acid manufacturing plants have been made by contact method, which can give more pure and less expensive acid

 pracheen, 2
 Middle Carpet and 3
 aadhunik-
 Early literature is more important from the point of view of Bengal's life and its merits and demerits
 chandidas, krittivas, maladhar, pipalai, lochanda, gyaandas, kavikankan, mukundaram, krishnadas, kashiram das, bharatchandaray, gunakar aadi kavi isi kaal main hue hai
 Like other scholars of India, the scholars of Bengal used to give special importance to the works of Sanskrit
 unki drushti main vahi "amar bharti" kaa pad sushobhit kar sakati thi
 He considered colloquial language to be variable and temporary
 kintu jansadharan to apane vichaaron or bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye usee bhashaa ko pasand kar sakate the jo unke hriday ke adhik nikat ho
 They could teach and teach in the same language
 puraatan bengal main is tarah kii do bhashaayen prachlit thim-ek to sthaneey bhashaa, jise ham pracheen banglaa kah sakate hai, duusari akhil bhartiya jan saahitiyik bhashaa, jo saamanyat: samooche uttar bharat main samajhi ja sakati thi
 It can be called Nagar or Shaurseni Apabhransh, which was largely the language of western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Punjab and Rajasthan
 saamaanya janata ke liye in donon bhashaaon main thodaa sa sahitya vidyaman tha
 Songs of love and devotion, proverbs and folklore were found in the mother tongue
 buddha tathaa hindu dharm ke upadeshak janata main prachaar karne ke liye jo rachanaayen taiyaar karte the ve praaia: puraani banglaa tathaa nagar apbhransh, donon main hoti thim
 47 Chariyapads are of special importance in the available compositions of the ancient Bengali
 ye praaia: aath panktiyon ke rahasyamay geet hai jinka sambandh mahayan bauddhadharm tathaa nathpanth, donon se sambhddha gupt sampradaay se he
 Their common external meaning is often understood in this way and the deeper meaning can also be understood with the help of Sanskrit commentary, which was received with this collection as well as Sri Harprasad Shastri
 in geeton yaa padyon main "kavita" naam kii cheez to nahin he kintu jivan kii ekaadh jhalak avashya kisi kisi main dekh padati he
 Some other poetic compositions similar to this were also received from Nepal by Dr
 Prabodhchandra Bagchi and Rahul Sankrityayan etc
 " 12veen shatabdi ke ant tak puraatan banglaa main yathesht sahitya taiyaar ho chukaa tha jisase us samay ke ek bengali kavi ne yah garvokti kii thi "log jaisaa ganga main snaan karne se pavitra ho jate hai, vaise hi ve 'bengal vaani' main snaat hokar pavitra ho sakate hai
 "but unfortunately, apart from the said 47 Chariyapadas and few songs or verses, very few compositions of that period are available today
 gitgovind ke rachayita jayadev bengal ke hindu raja lakshmana sen ke shasankaal main vidyaman the
 There are 24 songs in this beautiful poem describing the love of Radha and Krishna, but not everyone is perfect
 sanskrit main praaia: tukant nahin miltaa
 This is the specialty of Apabhransh or the budding indo-aryan languages
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki in padon kii rachana mulat: puraani banglaa main yaa apbhransh main kii gai thi or phir unamem thodaa parivartan kar sanskrit ke anuroop bana diya gaya
 In this way Jayadeva can be considered a famous poet of ancient Bengal, who in addition to Sanskrit, probably composed in Old Bengali too
 jo ho, bengal ke kitne hi pargami kaviyon ko unase prerana mili, isamen andeh nahin
 There is no evidence that there has been a big poem written in the old Bengali
 us samay aisi rachanaayen bengal main bhi praaia: apbhransh main hi hoti thim
 However, when the famous poet Vidyapati of Mithila composed the famous historical poem, he also practiced it not in his mother tongue Maithili, but in Apabhramsa, although in between, the words Maithil have also been used
 15veen shatee tathaa vishesh rup se 16veen shatee se hi bade prabandh kaavyon evam varnanaatmak rachanaaon kaa nirmaan prarambh hua, udaahrnarya adarsh nari bihula or uske pati lakhidhar kii katha, kalketu or phullara kaa kathanak, ityadi

 It was during this period that the Bengali-speaking Muslim population emerged and grew gradually
 turk akramanakariyon main se bahuton ne bengal kii striyon se hi vivaah kar liya or dhire-dhire "yahan kii bhashaa, rahan sahan aadi ko" apana liya
 They forgot Turkish and Arabic remained the language of religion only
 bengal main hindu jameendaaron or saamanton kii hi vyavastha abhi prachlit thi, falat: muslim vichaaron or paddatiyon kaa janajivan par abhi drushtigochar hone yogya vishesh prabhaav nahin padane paaya tha
 When peace was established in Bengal after some time, when the study of Sanskrit, preaching etc
 was facilitated, then education and literature as if the primary renaissance started
 madhyamik banglaa ke pratham mahakavi, jinke sambandh main hame kuch jaankaree he, sambhavat: krittivas ojha the 
 He was the first popular poet to present the Sanskrit Ramayana in Bengali, who portrayed Rama as Valmiki, not as a pure human and heroic man, but as a compassionate avatar of God, towards whom the heart of the simple devotional people is easily attracted could
 isi tarah krishnagtha kaa varnan usee shatabdi main maladhar basu ne kiya
 It is based on the Bhagavata Purana
 bihula kii katha, jo vivaah kii pratham raatri main hi mansa devi dwaara preshit sarp ke dwaara pati ke dase jane par vidhwaa ho gai thi or jisane badi badi kathinaaiyaan jhelkar devataaon ko tathaa mansa devi ko bhi prasann kar pati ko pun: jivit kara lene main safalataa praapt kii thi, pativrata nari ke prem or saahas kii vah apurv pariklpana he jiskaa aavirbhaav kabhi kisi bhartiya mastishk main hua ho
 This story was probably prevalent before the arrival of Muslims, but the first story based on it was composed in Bengali in the 15th century
 inamen se ek ke rachayita vijaygupt or duusari ke vipradaas pipalai maane jate hai
 Chandidas, a famous poet of the pre-secondary Bengali, is considered
 inke naam se koi 1200 pad yaa kavitaayen prachlit hai
 There is so much difference in their language, style etc
 that they do not seem to be composed by the same person
 aisa prathit hota he ki madhyamik banglaa main is naam ke kam se kam teen kavi hue
 The first Chandidas were the pioneers of Srikrishnakirtan who existed before Chaitanya, around 1400 AD
 duusare chandidas dwij chandidas the jo chaitanya ke baad main yaa uttar kaal main hue
 He composed most of the songs of Radha Krishna's love interest that earned Chandidas such a popularity
 tisare chandidas deen chandidas hue jo sangrah ke teen chauthai bhaag ke rachayita prathit hote hai
 There is no doubt that the first two Chandidas were the mainstays of Chandidas's fame

 Vaishnava scholars and poets had prepared many collections of them, out of which Vaishnavadasa's "padalpataru" is particularly famous

 At the same time some religious stories were also written
