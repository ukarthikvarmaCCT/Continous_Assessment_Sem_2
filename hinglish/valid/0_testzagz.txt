 graphical deveopment kii apni visheshtaon or BASIC parivaar kaa sadsy hone ke kaaran VB ko programing language seekhney or prayog karne kii drushti se apekshaakrit saral mana jaataa he
 Visual Basic derives from BASIC
 yah graphical yuzar interphes ke rapid aplication deveopment, data acces objects, remote data objects, yaa active-eks data objects ke dwaara database ke acces or active-eks controls or objects ke nirmaan ko sakasham banaata he
 The syntax of scripting languages, such as VBA and vbscript, is similar to that of Visual Basic but there is a difference in their performance
 ek programmer Visual Basic ke saath die gaye componants kaa prayog karke kisi aplication ko ikaitha kar saktaa he
 Programs written in Visual Basic can also use the Windows API, but doing this requires external function declarations
 aakiri baar 1998 main iskaa chatha sanskaran release kiya gaya tha
 Microsoft's extended support ended in March 2008, after which Visual basic
net became its designated successor
 BASIC programing language kii tarah Visual Basic ko bhi is tarah dizin kiya gaya ki ise seekhney or prayog karne main aasaani ho
 This language not only provides programmers with the ability to create simple GUI applications but can also develop complex applications
 VB main programing kai sari kriyaaon kaa sangyojan he
 These actions are: Visually arranging components or controls on a form, defining the attributes and functions of those components, and writing additional lines of code to further strengthen the role of functions
 Live, so programmers need to write too many lines of codes to write a simple program This is not necessary
 Although problems with performance efficiency were experienced in early versions, this problem is no longer a big issue with faster computers and native code compilation
 haalanki sanskaran 5 ke baad se prograamon ko netive code akjicutables main compyle kiya ja saktaa he par ab bhi unhen takreeban 1MB aakaar ke rantime librariyon ke upasthiti kii zaroorat hoti he
 This runtime includes 'by default' in Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows, but older versions of 95 / 98 / NT] require it to be delivered with executable
 forms kaa nirmaan draig-and-drop takneekon kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa he
 a device is used to place controls on the form
 controls ke saath event handlers or atributs jude hote hai
 When a control is created, it is also given default values, but can be changed by the programmer
 kai atribut vailuj ran time ke dauraan badale ja sakate hai jo ki yuzar acshans yaa envyranment main badlaav par nirbhar karata he
 For example, to change the state of the control, the code can be inserted into the form resize event handler so that it can stay centered on the form, spread to fill the form, etc
 By placing the code in a text box in the event handler for keypress, the program can automatically translate the case of inserted text, or even prevent some characters from being inserted
 Visual Basic se akjicutables, active-eks controls, yaa DLL files banaae ja sakate hai, lekin mukhya rup se iskaa prayog Windows aplications or database systams ke interphes taiyaar karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Dialog boxes with less functionality can be used to provide pop-up functionality
 control, aplication kii mul kriyasheeltaa pradaan karata he jabaki programmers upyukt event handlers main or adhik logic daal sakate hai
 For example, a drop-down combination box automatically shows its list from which the user can select any element
 jab ek item kaa chayan hota he to ek event handler 'kol' hota he jo tab programmer dwaara likhe gaye atirikt code ko akjicute kar kisi khaas kaam ko anjaam detaa he
 Which particular task is started depends on which element was selected, such as filling a related list
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki ek Visual Basic component main koi yuzar interphes ho hi nahin, iske bajaay yah duusare prograamon ko component object model ke madhyam se active-eks objects uplabdh karaata he
 This feature makes server-side processing or an add-in module possible
 yah ek garbej colected language he jisamen garbej collection reference counting ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It has a large library of utility objects and a basic object oriented support
 chunki difolt project template main zyada saamaanya componants shaamil rahete hai, isliye programmer ko kabhi-kabhaar hi atirikt librariz ko nirdisht karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Unlike many other programming languages, Visual Basic is generally not 'case sensitive', although it converts keywords to a standard case configuration and makes the case of variable names consistent with the case of the entry inside the symbol table
 is
 bai difolt strings kii tulana cese sensitive hoti he, par ise icchaanusaar 'cese insensitive' bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The Visual Basic compiler is shared with other Visual Studio languages, but due to the constraints in the IDE it is not possible to create some 'targets' and threading models

 Visual Basic kaa nirmaan karne ke liye Microsoft ne Basic language ke saath Ruby ko sanyukt karne kaa faisla kiya
 The Ruby Interface Generator provided the "visual" part of Visual Basic mixed with "EB" embedded BASIC engines designed for the "omega" database system (which Microsoft abandoned)
 Ruby ne atirikt controls vaale dianmik link librariz ko lod karne kii suvidha bhi pradaan kii, jo baad main VBX interphes ho gaya
 Microsoft has developed derivatives of Visual Basic for use in scripting
 vizual basic ko swayan vyapak rup se BASIC se viksit kiya gaya he or tatpashchaat ise 
NET plateform sanskaran ke saath pratisthapit kiya gaya he
 Some derivatives languages are: |microsoft Office ]]), tathaa solidworks, autocad, ], arcgis or Sage Accpac ERP jaise kai third-party utpaadon main bhi sammilit kiya gaya he
 The way VBA has been implemented in various applications has minor irregularities, but broadly it is the same language as VB6 and uses the same runtime library
 |staroffice Basic ]] staroffice suite main sammilit ek interprator he jo Visual Basic ke saath campatibal he
 It has been developed by]
 Visual Basic ke shuruuaati praturup, code ko sirf p-code yaa Pseudo code main sankalit karte the
 Both Visual Basic 5 and 6 can compile code in native or p-code; It depends on the programmer how he wants to compile the code
 p-code language rantime, jise virtual mashin ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, ke dwaara interpret kiya jaataa he
 Virtual machines are implemented for the purpose of advantages such as portability and small code
 tab bhi, isse ek dikkat yah he ki rantime dwaara code ke interpritesan kii atirikt parat akjicution ko dhimaa kar detii he
 However some codes and algorithms can be created that can run faster than compiled native code
 Visual Basic aplications ke liye Microsoft Visual Basic rantime msvbvmxx

 europe meniyo classisism ko pratishthit karne main mukhya bhoomika 17veen sadi ke french sahityakaron or aalochakon kii thi, jinhone 16veen sadi ke italvi aalochakon dwaara arastu, horess aadi pracheen greek or roman sahityachintakon ke siddhanton par kiye gaye mataikyheen vichaarvimarsh ko kathor vyavasthit or praaia: nirjeev reeti kaa rup de diya
 The French criticalists did not reach out to the ancient Greek and Roman thinkers directly through Italian critics of their interest, as a result of which they charged their customs on the principles of the ancient Classico, especially Aristotle, with great freedom
 aalochana main is ritivaad kaa pratham mahatvapurn prachaarak mailarb hua
 Between 1630 and 1660, this formalism spread more
 yah kaary shaplein, bvylo, raapem, le bossu ityadi ke dwaara sampann hua or isamen unhen lui ke darbar ke sangrakshan main santhaapit french academy, dekart ke buddhivaad or catholic carch se prerana or samarthan praapt hua
 The focus of neo-classical criticism turned to poetry, which also included epics and grief and happy metaphors
 uske kuch saadhaaran siddhant the, jaise, kavita kaa lakshya manoranjan se adhik naitik shiksha he; kavyashastra yaa reeti kaa gyaan pratibha se adhik aavashyak he; reeti kaa arth kalasikon kaa anukaran he: kavy kii vastu main ‘satya’ sarvopari he or satya kaa arth he maanav dwaara anubhoot saarvbhaum satya; or kalpana ke udvaig ke sthaan par bauddhik sanyam or santulan hona chahie; abhivyakti main spashtataa or laghav hona chahie; rachanavidhan main vyavastha, anupaan or santulan kaa samyak nirvaah hona chahie
 In short, these simple rules had three axles, intelligence, neer-kshir-vivek and artistic interest
 jahaan tak kavyarupon kaa prashn tha, nio-clasical aalochana shastriyon ke anusaar prayek rup ke vishay, lakshya, prabhaav or sheliyaan pracheenon ne nishchit kar di thi
 It was on this basis that he composed the composition of epic and happy plays
 unhone du:khant main prahasan or prahasan main du:khant ke tatwon ke sammishran kii ninda kii or kaal, desh evam ghatana ke sandhitray ko roopak ke rachanavidhan kaa kendriya siddhant mana
 Neo-classical theories had a profound impact on the then European literature as France of 14th Louis was the cultural center of Europe

 The features of classicism that Elliot has mentioned in his article on Virgil, 'whiteize Classic', are summarized as follows: the expression of the maturity of thinking and folklore, the perception of history, tradition and social destiny, in language or style
 Generalization, liberal and broad receptivity of approach, universality
 pracheen clasikon ne apana kaary sahitya, saamaajik jivan or chintan kii mahan paramparaon ke sandarbh se sampann kiya
 Neo-classical litterateurs also had this realization, but they did not have these great references before them
 nio-classisism aise yug kii upaj he jab samaaj kisi vikaas ke daur se guzar kar jadta kii sthiti main aa jaataa he, jab vah band gali ke chor par pahunchakar ruk jaataa hai
 At such a time, the place of object becomes secondary and the place of form becomes dominant in literature
 yah roopashakti sahitya main roodhi yaa ritivaad kii atyant urvar bhoomi he
 It is not surprising that in this era of Western Europe's cultural crisis there was a revival of Nia-classicism in English and other literature

 Greek and Roman literature and European literature in their perspective are discussed above under the traditional definition of 'classic'
 uparyukt sahitya ke sandarbh main hum ne yah prashn uthaaya ki homer aaj se hajaar-do hajaar saal purv rome or athens padhe jate the or aaj bhi ve landan or paris main padhe jate hai
 Despite many variations and changes, their importance remains till date, what is the reason for this? In response to this question, it was felt that the literature which has stood the test of time is the 'classic'
 atev ab yah samajha jane laga he ki clasik sahitya vah he jisamen jivan ke un tatwon kaa samavesh nishchit rup se ho jinaki upyogita or sarthakata prayek yug or desh ke liye aprihaary he
 Indian literature can be seen from the same definition of 'classic'

 Many Sanskrit poems and epics can be counted under it

 mulya-nirdhaaran ke ghatak hai nirmaan laagat, bazaar, pratiyogita, bazaar sthiti or utpaada kii gunvattta
 mulya-nirdhaaran vyashti-arthshaastra mulya aabantan siddhant main bhi ek mahatvapurn prabhavit karne vaala kaarak he
 Pricing is a fundamental aspect of financial modeling and is one of the four P's of the marketing mix
 anya teen pahalu hai utpaada, protsaahan or jagah
 chaar p main qeemat hi ekmaatr aay paidaa karne vaala tatv he, jabaki shesh laagat centre hai
 Pricing is a manual or automated process of applying prices to purchase and sale orders, based on the following factors: a fixed amount, quantity of goods, incentives or sales campaigns, specific seller bids, prices prevailing upon entry, shipment or invoice
 Date, multiple orders or combinations of lines and many others
 Automated systems require more set-up and maintenance, but can prevent pricing errors
 upabhokta kii zaruuraton ko maang main keval tabhi parivartit kiya ja saktaa he, jab utpaada ko kharidne kii upabhokta kii ichha or kshamta maujuud he
 Thus pricing is very important for marketing
 mulya nirdhaaran main sawaal poochna shaamil he, jaise ki: The well-chosen price should have three functions: vikreta ke drushtikon se, ek prabhavi qeemat vah qeemat he jo us adhiktam ke bahut nikat he jitna graahak bhugtan karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 In economic terms, it is the price that transfers most of the consumer's surplus to the producer
 ek acha mulya-nirdhaaran vah hoga jo ek mulya tal or mulya seemaa ke bich santulan sthapit karata he
 There are innumerable terms and strategies specific to pricing: prabhavi mulya vah mulya he jo company ko chhot, prachaar or anya protsaahan raashi ke liye lekhankan ke baad hasil hota he
 Pricing is the use of a limited number of prices for all product offerings of the seller
 yah parampara puraane five and dim dukaanon par shuru kii gai thi jahaan har chiz kaa daam 5 yaa 10 saint hota tha
 The underlying logic in this is that these amounts are viewed by potential customers as appropriate price points for the entire range of products
 iskaa faaydaa he prashasan main aasaani, lekin nuksaan he anamyata, vishesh rup se mudrasphiti ke samay yaa asthir keematen
 a loss leader is a product whose price is set below the operating margin
 isse us vishisht mad par is aashaa main udhyam ke liye nuksaan parinat hota he ki vah graahakon ko dukaan kii ore aakarshith karegaa or unamem se kuch graahak anya, ucch margin vaali maden kharidenge
 Enforcement pricing refers to an example where pricing is a key element of the marketing mix
 mulya / gunvattta sambandh adhikansh upabhoktaaon kii us dharna ko sanderbhit karata he ki apekshaakrit oonche daam acchhee gunvattta kaa sanket hai
 Confidence in this regard is more important for complex products that are difficult to test, and experiential products cannot be tested unless they are used
 The more uncertainty surrounding the product, the more consumers depend on the price / quality hypothesis and are prepared to pay a higher premium
 iskaa clasik udhaaharan he ek snake kek tvinkis jisaki gunvattta ko qeemat ghataane ke baad kam aanka gaya
 Excessive dependence on price / quality by consumers may increase the prices of all products and services, including low quality products, due to which the price / quality relationship is no more applicable
 premium mulya-nirdhaaran ek aisi ranneeti he jo pratishtha ke prati sajag upabhoktaaon ko aakarshith karne main madad ke liye, lagaataar sambhavya mulya seemaa par, yaa ucch laagat or parishkrut qeemat par mulya-nirdhaaran karti he
 Examples of companies participating in premium pricing in the market include Rolex and Bentley
 People will buy a premium priced product because: goldilox mulya-nirdhaaran aam taur par premium keemat par utpaada ke "gold-plated" sanskaran uplabdh karaane kii pratha ko paribhaashit karne ke liye prayukt shabd he taaki doosraa kam daam vaala vikalp yathochit qeemat kaa prathit ho; udhaaharan ke liye, graahakon ko paison ke liye acchhee qeemat ke rup main bijnes-class airline siten dekhne ke liye or bhi ucch daam vaale pratham-shrenee ke vikalp kii peshkash sahit protsaahit karnaa
isi prakaar, victorian england main tisare darje ke railway sawari dibbon ko bina khidki ke bananaa, joki tisare darje ke graahakon ko dandit karne ke liye nahin apitu dwitiya shrenee kii siten vahan kar sakane waalon ko saste vikalp kaa chunaav karne ke badale protsaahit karnaa
 yah mulya pakshpaat ke sambhavit parinaam ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Its name is derived from the story of Goldilocks in which Goldilocks chose the hot Rabri and not the cold, but instead chose what was "just right"
 And technically, this type of pricing takes advantage of the general cognitive bias that tends toward extremes
 yah abhyaas academik taur par "framing" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 By providing three options, you can smartly influence the consumer to choose the medium option, and thus the middle option will earn more profit for the seller, as it is often the chosen choice
 maang aadhaarit mulya-nirdhaaran aisi koi bhi mulya-nirdhaaran paddati he jo kendriya tatv ke rup main - upabhokta ke maang - aadhaarit maane gaye mulya kaa upyog karata he
 These include: high price, price bias and income management, price points, psychological pricing, bundled pricing, entry pricing, pricing, price-based pricing, land and premium pricing
 Pricing factors are cost, market, competition, market position, product quality
 bahuaiami mulya-nirdhaaran ekaadhik sankhyaon ke upyog dwaara utpaada yaa seva kaa mulya-nirdhaaran he
 In this practice, the price does not include a single monetary amount, but rather different dimensions
 Research has shown that this practice can significantly affect consumers' ability to understand and process price information
 apni pustak, da stratji and tactics of priceing main thomas nagle or read holden ne 9 siddhant yaa ghatakon kaa ullekh kiya he jo kharidaar kii mulya sambandhi samvedansheeltaa ko prabhavit karte hai: Three levels can be considered towards pricing
 Pricing as a highly effective leverage
 udyog, bazaar or len-dein str
 Pricing at the industry level focuses on the overall benefits of the industry including changes in prices by the supplier and changes in customer demand
 bazaar str par mulya-nirdhaaran, tulanaatmak pratispardhi utpaadon ke saath utpaada ke mulya antar kii tulana main qeemat kii pratispardhaatmak sthiti par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 Moving from pricing, reference, or list price at the behavioral level, which focuses on implementation management of rebates, both on the invoice or receipt, or beyond
 vyashti vipanan bazaar ke andar vyashti khandon kii aavashyaktaaon or zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye anukool utpaada, brands prachaar kii pratha he
 It is a type of market optimization that deals with pricing of customer / product combinations at the store or individual level

 Knowledge of the substances used in medicine is known as pharmacology or pharmaceutical science or 'pharmaceutical' or 'pharmacy'
 iske antargat aushadhon kaa gyaan tathaa unka sangyojan hi nahin varan unki pahchaan, sangrakshan, nirmaan, vishleshan tathaa pramapan bhi hai
 The invention and synthesis of new drugs are the main functions of pharmaceuticals

 In regular expression or regular expression computing, there is a concise, flexible, and convenient way to search or find and replace strings
 udhaaharan ke liye kam khojane par yah camel ko bhi khojega or qamar ko bhi
 Regular expressions are abbreviated as regex or regexp
 regular oxpraishan kaa prayog kai programmen bhashaaon main karnaa sambhav he iske prayog se ek hi line main bahut badi baat kahi yaa likhi ja sakati he jisase program chota or suvachy ho jaataa he
 For those who are not programmers, it is very much used as a 'find and Replace'
 nimnlikhit udhaaharan kuch aisi visheshtaon ko spasht karte hai, jinhen regular oxpraishan main abhivyakt kiya ja sake: Regular expressions can be even more complex than these examples: Regular expressions have been used by many text editors to search for and customize textual patterns based on usability and patterns in the programming of languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, Perl, Ruby or Tcl shashakt regular oxpraishan engine unke vaakya vinyas main bana hua he
 Many of the utilities offered by Unix distributions - editor ed and filter grep - were the first to popularize the concept of regular expressions

 In superficial terminology, \ bex will find its corresponding string "ex" in two possible fields, at the beginning of words and between two characters in a string, one of which is a word character and the other is not a word character

 For example, 'set' which consists of three strings "handel", "händel" and "haendel" can be described as h ndel's pattern
 In most formalisms, if a regex matches a particular set, it should be known that there are an infinite number of such indicators
 adhikansh akaarwaad nimnlikhit kriyaaon ke liye regular oxpraishan banaati hai
 "gray" or "gray" matches with | gray
 |grey or gry samroop patterns hai, jo "gray " or "grey " donon hi set ko varnit karte hai
 For example, ab * c matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbc" and so on

 Over time, Thompson's fundamental version of regular expressions has undergone many changes, with widespread applicability like Unix and Unix, including expr, AWK, Emacs, vi, and lex
 Perl or Tcl regular oxpraishan henry spencer likhit rijex librari se lee gai thim, haalanki Perl ko spencer kii librari main anek nai visheshtaayen jodne ke liye prasaarit kiya gaya
 Philip Hazel developed PCRE, which tries to mimic Perl's regular expression functionality, and is used by many modern tools PHP and Apache HTTP Server
 Perl 6 kii dizine kii pracheshtaa kaa ek hissaa parl ke regular oxpraishan ke ekikaran main sudhaar tathaa unke kaaryakshetra evam kshamtaaon ko badhanaa taaki suchakon kii padvyakhya ke vyakaran ko paribhaashit karne kaa mauka diya ja sake
 parinamswaroop ek laghu bhashaa Perl 6 niyam bani, jiskaa prayog Perl 6 grammer ko paribhaashit karne or saath hi saath bhashaa main programmers ke liye upkaran muhaiyaa karaane ke liya hota he
 These rules uphold the features of Perl 5
x regular expressions, but also allow bnf-style definitions of graceful post interpretations by the sub-rules
 dastauez or databes modelling ke liye sanrachit soochna maanakon main regular oxpraishan kaa prayog 1960 ke dashak main aarambh hua or 1980 ke dashak main fail gaya, jab ISO SGML udyog maanak samekit hue
 bhashaa maanakon main sanrachana kii suspashtataa ke centre main regular oxpraishan hai
 The simple use of the DTD element in group syntax is obvious
 pattern milan: itihaas bhi dekhen Regular expression can be defined as formal language theory
 regular oxpraishan main sthiraank or operators hote hai, jo strings ke sets in seton par kriyashltaaon ko kramshah suchit karte hai
 The following definitions are standard and found in most textbooks of formal language theory
 Given a bounded alphabet Σ, the following constants are defined: nimnlikhit sankriyaayein paribhaashit hai: | denotes α in r and β in S}
 udhaaharan ke liye {"ab", "c"}{"d", "ef"} = {"abd", "abef", "cd", "cef"}
 | s which indicates the alliance of r and S
 udhaaharan ke liye {"ab", "c"}|{"ab", "d", "ef"} = {"ab", "c", "d", "ef"}
 To avoid parentheses, it has been assumed that clean star has the highest priority, followed by a combination and then a set alliance
 If there is no doubt, parentheses may be omitted
 udhaaharan ke liye, c ko abc or a|) ko a|bc* jaisaa bhi likhaa ja saktaa he
 Many textbooks use ∪, +, or ∨ signs for combination instead of perpendicular bars
 udhaaharan: | b * denotes {ε, {0} a, b, bb, bbb, 


}
 |b)* khaali string: {ε, {0}a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, 


} samet a or b ke alaava bina pratik chihnon ke sabhi string ke set ko sanketit karata he
 | ε) denotes a set of strings starting with a, then zero or more bs and ending with the option ac: {{0} a, ac, ab, abc, abb, abbc, 


}
 regular oxpraishan kii aupchaarik paribhaasha jaanboojhkar kifayati he or anaavashyak parimank ? se bachane ke liye tathaa +, jise : a+ = aa* or a?= ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes the complement operator is added; All sets of strings on Rc σ * that are not in r c are indicated
 niyamtah poorak oparator anaavashyak he, jaisaa ki duusare operataron kaa upyog kar ise simit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, such a formulation computing process is complex and this may require indicators of size that are exponentially twice as large
 is arth main regular oxpraishan suvyavasthit bhashaa ko suchit kar sakate hai, thik-thik bhashaa kii aisi shrenee jo niyamaatmak parimit autometa ke dwaara sweekrut he
 However, there is a notable difference in consistency
 suvyavasthit bhashaaon kii kuch shreniyon ko niyamaatmak parimit autometa dwaara varnit kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa aakaar ghaataanki rup se sabase chote regular oxpraishan ke samakaksh bad jaataa he
 Languages are the standard example here
 Lk varna {{0}a,b } par jiskaa antim akshar k a kii barabari apane sabhi strings sahit karata he
 On the one hand, the regular expression describing l 4 is given by ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^ {*} a}
 is pattern ko Lk main samanyikaran suchak detaa he On the other hand, it is well known that the transitive finite automaton accepting the Lk language must have at least 2k k in many cases
 bhagyavash, regular oxpraishan se adhik aam aniyatatmak parimit autometa tak saral maanchitran he, jo achaanak itnaa bada visphotak aakaar grahan nahin kar letaa; yahi kaaran he ki nfas ko aksar suvyavasthit bhashaaon ke vaikalpik nirupan ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 nfas are simple transformations of the type-3 grammers of the Chomsky sequence
 ant main, yah dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki vastav jagat main anek regular oxpraishan engine aisi visheshtaon ko lagu karte hai, jise regular oxpraishan ke dwaara aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant ke arth main varnit nahin kiya ja saktaa; is vishay par adhikadhik jaankaree ke liye neeche dekhen
 As seen from the examples, various regular expressions can express the same language: formalism is unnecessary
 kalanvidhi main lekhan sambhav he jo die gaye regular oxpraishan ke madhya yah nirnay karne ke liye ki ullikhit bhashaaen anivaary rup se ek samaan hai ki nahin
 yah prayek abhivyakti ko nunatam niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin kii had tak kam kar detaa he or nirdhaarit karata he ki kya ve samakritik samakaksh hai yaa nahin
 To what extent can this redundancy be removed? Can we find an interesting subset of regular expressions that are fully suggestive? An alliance of clean stars and sets is obviously necessary, but perhaps we can ban their use
 yah ascharyajanak rup se kathin samasya main badal saktaa he
 Regular expressions are so simple that there is no way to rewrite them in any form
 In the past the lack of self-certification led to the problem of Star Height
 haal hi main, dextor kosen main regular oxpraishan ko clin ke bijganit ke saath swatah pramanit kar diya
 Traditional Unix regular expression syntax did not follow common conventions, but often differed from device to device
 IEEE POSIX basic regular oxpraishan maanak khaskar ulti anukulata ke liye paramparaagat vaakya-vinyas ke saath ise dizine kiya gaya, kintu isane ek saamaanya maanak uplabdh karaayaa jise kai Unix regular oxpraishan upkarnon ke vyatikram vaale vaakya-vinyas ke rup main apana liya gaya he, haalanki isamen ab bhi aksar kuch vividhtaayen athwa atirikt visheshtaayen dikhaai detii hai
 There are several tools that support ERE syntax with command line topics
 BRE vaakya-vinyas main, adhikansh aksharon ko shabdic arth main liya jaataa he -- ve aapas main ek duusare se mail khate hai 
 neeche soochibaddh apwaadon ko aksharon se pare yaa anukramon se alag kaha jaataa he
 Examples: aksharon se pare kaa arth bekaslash se bachakar kuch aksharon ke liye POSIX vistrut regular oxpraishan ke vaakya-vinyas main vipareet he
 In this syntax itself, a backslash causes meta characters to be treated as literal characters
 atah udhaaharan ke liye, \ ab he or \ { \ } ab { }
 saath hi saath, pichley sandarbhon ke liye ko hataa liya gaya he or nimnlikhit aksharon se pare ko shaamil kiya gaya hai: Examples: |dog "cat " yaa "dog " ke saath mail khaataa he
 POSIX extended regular expressions can often be used with modern Unix applicability by including the command line flag -E
 chunki aksharon kii anek vargeekrut shreniyan chune hue sthaneey setting, POSIX maanak aksharon kii kuch shreniyon athwa virgon ko nimna talika main dikhaaya gaya he: POSIX character categories can only be used within parentheses
 udhaaharan ke liye, ab] ucchvarg ke bade aksharon evam chote aksharon "a " or "b " ke saath hi mail khaataa he
 In Perl's regular expression, coincides with and combines with
 ek atirikt gaiyr-posix shrenee ko kuch upkarnon ke dwaara samajha gaya he vah he, jise aamtaur par plus rekhankan underscore ke dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 This raises the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that can be used as identification marks
 sampadak Vim aage verde or verde-head shrenee ke bich antar spasht karte hue pahchaan bataate hai 
 chunki kai programing bhashaaon main jo akshar pahchaan chihn ke rup main aarambh kar sakate hai ve unke samaan nahin hai, jo anya sthiti main upasthit ho sakate hai
 It is noted that POSIX regular expression standards call character classes in the color of other regular expressions, which support them, they are commonly referred to as POSIX character classes
 adhikansh anya regular oxpraishan flavors ke saath kairactor claces pad-bandha kaa prayog POSIX nirdhaarit koshthak suchakon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Perl has a more consistent and rich syntax than POSIX Basic and Extended Regular Expression Standards
 isaki nirantarata kaa ek udhaaharan he ki \ hameshaa gaiyr-varnankit aksharon se alag bhaagta he
 Another example of functionality is possible with Perl, but not with POSIX - the subsequent regular expression concept of sluggish quantification
 vyapak rup se apni suchak kshamta ke kaaran kai anya prayojyata or programing kii bhashaaon ne vaakya-vinyas ko Perl kii hi tarah apana liya he -- udhaaharan ke liye, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework or w3c's XML Schema sabhi regular oxpraishan vaakya-vinyas kaa prayog Perl kii hi tarah karte hai
 Some languages and tools such as Boost and PHP support multiple regular expression flavors
