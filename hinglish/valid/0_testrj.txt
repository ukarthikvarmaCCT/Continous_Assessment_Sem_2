 O
 Henry or William Sidney Porter was a famous American writer
 unka janm 11 sitambar, 1862 ke din greensbaro, uttar kerolina main hua or mratyu 5 june, 1910 ko new yark main
 In previous years, he used to write his middle name as 'sydney'
 solah varsh kii umr main unhone skool chhod diya, par unki padhane-likhane kii aturata nahin chhuti
 As a child, he worked in a drugstore in Greensboro, where his birth anniversary is still celebrated
 unniis varsh kii avasthaa main vah apana swasthya sudhaarney ke liye texas pradesh ke gocharon main rahane chalaa gaya
 There he learned horse riding and also subdued wild, stubborn horses
 fir austin main use ek kheti-baadi ke daphtar main naukari mil gayi
 All the things of his pictorial life around which he was introduced, all of them were captured in his stories
 yahi kaaran he ki uski kahaniyaan adhiktar charaagahon ke pradesh, madhya america yaa neuyark main ghatit hoti he
 The urban life stories for which he is famous are an acknowledgment of the irony of life
 ve unke apane katu anubhavon ke pratibimb hai
 In his fifteen-year-old Texas stay in which he married and became the father of a daughter, regretful subtractions covered his hopes
 unhe kisi bank main note ginaney kaa kaam mil gaya, lekin kuch hi dinon main uske hisaab main kuch hajaarek dollars kii gadabad kaa pataa chalane par, vah naukari bhi chhot gai
 It seems that his boss did not want to punish him, so he continued to work in a newspaper in the city of Houston for almost a year, without stopping
 tab, shaayad giraftaari se bachane ke liye vah new orlians chale gaye, jahaan se unhone tojilo or honduras kaa tikat kataa liya
 Described in his first book titled 'cabbage and Kings', the place of all the stories of courage and adventure is found here
 apni patni kii beemaari ne unhe vaapis austin bula liya
 She died as soon as they returned
 tab khyanat ke aparaadh main unpar mukadmaa chalaa or sajaa ho gayi
 William Porter, jailed for three years and three months
 vah apni sajaa ko utsaahpurvak jhelane vaala ek sadaachari kaidi the
 But the black shadow of this period was always visible on his life
 yaheen se unamem garibon ke prati dayaa bhav utpann hua or yahi se uski kai shreshth kahaniyon kaa janm hua, jinamein se 'hryday parivartan' naamak kahani ke aadhaar par khelaa gaya 'urf jimmy balantin' naamak naatak, us samay kaa sarvshereshth naatak siddh hua
 His surname has been discovered by a captain of the prison's soldiers named Henry
 porter ne sochaa ki hastakshar karne ke liye 'o0 henry' hi kaafii he
 When he started writing, he also requested the editors to keep his name a secret
 neuyark main o0 henry, medisson chowk or irving plas ke muhallon ke kamaron main rahete or apni kahaniyon se paisa kama-kama kar kiraaya chukaane ke liye bheeshan sangharsh karte rahete
 Friends, Robert H
 Davis, Bartlett Maris, Irwin S
 Kaab, and many other writers and editors have described their rooms
 ve ek baahar vaale kamare main rahata the
 Whose windows were spread to the floor
 yahaan baithkar vah rahgeeron kii ore ghoorte rahete or unke ird-gird jeevat ke jaal bunate rahete
 He began to make optimistic, monogamous individuals eligible for their stories
 un ladakiyon kii kalpana kii, jo dhandha or pyaar paane ke liye, shaharon main bhatakane aati hai; ve yuvak, jo dusron se adhik laabh khojate hai or ve sharaabi tathaa ayogy aadmi, jo durbhaagya ko bhi ahankaar se jhelte hai tathaa kabhi-kabhi kahaniyon ke paatro kii tarah bhavukta pradarshit karte hai, uske kathanayake bane
 If the plot was unhappy, O
 Henry would have added salt and pepper to the local dialects
 uske liye koi ghatana itani neeras nahin thi ki jisamen vah chamak na paidaa kar sake
 Arriving at the same place, he invented that extreme point or turn, which led to the end of many of his stories becoming unpredictable
 "sajaa hua cameraa,""chat par kaa cameraa" or "vaasanthi menu" jaisi choti kahaniyon main to yah spasht he hi, kuch badi kahaniyon main bhi is tatv ke darshan hote hai
 In the American audience, since the era of sitting around the fire of old times and listening to stories, there has been a special affection for this type of anecdote
 o0 henry kii kahaniyaan inhen paramparaagat kathaon kii vistrat pratikratiyaan maaloom detii he
 He was a magician in the plot and he was a master at creating such hypothetical situations, where his characters seem to be playing with him rather than living
 pathako kaa manoranjan karnaa uskaa dhyey tha or unki kautuhalavratti ko jagaate rakhane ke liye, unhone apanepatro se tarah-tarah ke tamaashe karawaaye hai
 They are depicted as hungry for romance, boldly combating bad times, pretending nobility and wandering in the colorful world of modern 'alif-laila'
 manushya kaa sarvasparshi or sagopang vishleshan unhone shaayad hi kahin kiya ho
 He saw the human being, stranded in the vortex of modern urban life, as a helpless person
 'sneh deep' kahani kii nansi ko sirf ek dukaan main kaam karne ke kaaran, ek dukandaar ladki maanane se vah inkaar kar detaa he or kahata he," ansi koi kism nahin hoti
 Today's corrupt society has become used to finding variety
 " usne manushya ko itnaa gira hua shaayad hichitrit kiya ho ki vah apni kamajoriyon ke liye sharminda bhi na ho
 Beneath all his stories is an undercurrent of kindness and sympathy
 jeevanamen bhuule-bhatke yaa pichde hue har badanaseeb ko vah manushyata ke vyapak kutumb main sthaan dene ko sadaa tatpar rahaa
 Sometimes they entertain him, sometimes make him sad with the irony of his life and sometimes he gets emotional, but in any case, he accepts every manipulation of fate and his villains are also ridiculous
 - Not evil
 o0 henry kii kala, uski duusari kitaab 'da for million' main nikhar uthi, jisase use kaafii lokapriyata bhi mili
 Forty years after it was first published, the story of his 'gift' was made into a movie
 uski anya kahaniyon ke kai sankalan prakashit hue jaise 'sneh deep', 'pashchim kii aatma', 'shahar kii aawaaj' ,'bhagyachakr' ,'vikalp' ,'dhandhe kii baat' ,' jivan chakra' 
 After his death, three books were published - 'white-collar thugs', 'awara' and 'bhule-bhate'
 o0henry kii kahaniyaan uske jeevankaal main atyann prasiddh raheen or yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki apni rachanaaon or apni vichaardhaara, donon main manushyaswabhaav kii numaaish vratti ke prati asantosh pradarshit karte hue usne hryday kii gaharaaiyon main utarane kii koshish kii
 He wanted to hide the true form of man, rip off every veil of stereotypes and beliefs and make him see the truth
 vah kaha karte the ki satya kii sachhee anubhuti keval kathasahitya main hi ho sakati he
 By arriving at this conclusion from his personal experience, O
 Henry re-established the scholarly belief that imagination is a more powerful invention of beauty than historical fact
 peshewar kahanikaron dwaara bhi kahani-kala main parivartan kiya ja rahaa tha
 The basic, mental, and physical deficiencies of every human being affecting the behavior of man were being discovered and the social effects on the person's life were being evaluated
 yadi jivit rahata to o- henry kahaan pahunchate- yah kahana kathin he, par uskaa yogadan kaafii hota
 Today the stories of O
 Henry are read as a symbol of his era
 jis prakaar brett heart kii kathaayen, pashchimi simapradesh ke khan ke mazdooron, juaariyon or thekedaaron ko punerjeevit kar detii hai, usee prakaar o0 henry kii kahaniyaan san 1900 ke aas-paas kii duniya khadi kar detii he
 When he made fun of the cavalry, the cavalrymen of the Battle of Spain were remembered
 amerikanon ko madhya america ke chote-chote rajya, utane hi vicitra lagate hai, jitna ki uski kahani main varnit achchuriya! swabhaav se vah sankochi or mitbhaashi tha
 He loved Sohbat and a little wine from some of his close friends - who were mainly editors of newspapers
 use hameshaa samay kii kami rahati thi, kyonki uski kahaniyaan atyant choti hoti thi or unke badalen main use jo kuch miltaa, turant samaapt ho jaataa tha
 He continued to grind under the constant demands of the editors
 uske liye jivan ek ast-vyast vyapaar tha, jisamen puraskaar milane kaa dhang bada sanakee he
 Nevertheless, he welcomed this behavior with every gesture
 uski kahaniyon membhagya or sanyog, mahatvapurn part adaa karte he
 There is also ample amount of grief and pain, but bitterness has not penetrated anywhere
 47 varsh kii choti-si aayu main niyati ne jab uski igalila samaapt kar di, tab tak uski sarvshereshth rachanaaen to shaayad likhi nahin gayin thi, parantu usne jo kuch bhi likhaa, uski kathasahitya par amit chhap rahegi or uski kuch kahaniyaan to amar rahegi

 shabdkosh nirmaan se sambandhit sakal kaaryon kaa samucchy koshkarm yaa koshavidya kehalaati he
 It is difficult to create sections or sections of dictionaries in terms of subjects
 alag alag koshkar apni samaj ke anusaar is prakaar ke vishayvibhag banaaya karte the
 There was neither any fixed order nor could it happen
 isaliye logon ko praaia: sara kosh kanthsth karnaa padataa tha
 For this reason, dictionaries in Western countries started being made alphabetically
 aise kosh ratane nahin padate the or aavashyaktaanusaar jab jiskaa ji chahta tha, tab vah uskaa upyog kar saktaa tha
 Nowadays, in almost all countries and all languages, this sequence is being used in the field of thesaurus: which is the most important in terms of the curious
 isi liye kosh ke jitne prakaar hote hai, un sab main praaia: aksharkram kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are many types of thesaurus, but considering the meaning, they can be divided into two parts
 ek to ve jinamein kisi bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth or vivechan usee bhashaa main hote he or duusare ve jinamein ek bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaaon me die jate hai
 There can be many types of thesaurus with the idea of subject, such as Mathematics dictionary, Legal dictionary, Medical dictionary etc
 aise koshon kii ginati praaia: shabdaawaliyon main hoti he, jaise krishi shabdaawalee, darshanik shabdaawalee, bhugolic shabdaawalee aadi
 Apart from these, some specific poets, dialects etc
 also have different lexicons, such as Tulsi Kosh, Sur Kosh, Awadhi Kosh, Brajbhasha Kosh, etc
 kisi vishisht vishay ke mahatvapurn granth main aae hue mukhya pratikon, vishyon yaa shabdon ke jo kosh yaa talikaay hoti he, unhen kramaat pratikanukramanika, vishayanukramanika yaa shabdanukramanika kehete hai
 Lexicography is an art
 is kala kaa gyaan vartmaan yug kii param unnat bhashaaon ke shabdkoshon kaa sookshm drushti se adhyayan karne par praapt ho saktaa he
 Editing of good and authentic thesaurus cannot be done only on the strength of scholarship, as long as the art of lexicography is also fully understood and the knowledge of this art can only come from the lifelong study of the lexicon
 sabhi prakaar ke kosh kisi vishesh uddeshy tathaa kisi vishesh kshetra kii aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye hi banaae jate hai
 Therefore, this purpose or need is mainly taken care of in the lexicon
 duusare, is baat kaa bhi baraabar dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki uskaa sara kalevar sabhi drushtiyon se santulit rahe; aisa na ho ki koi ang to aavashyaktaa yaa auchity se adhik bad jaae or koi uski tulana main kshinkaay yaa hin jaan pade
 The words should also be discussed and the order of the organs of that thought should always remain the same
 shabdon kii bhi jatiyaan yaa varg hote hai, at: ek jati yaa varg ke sab shabdon kaa sara vivechan ek sa hona chahie
 If examples of authentic texts or writers are taken, then they should be taken as much fraction as possible to clarify the intention and resolve the curious
 achche koshon main sabhi prakaar ke kshetron or vishyon ke paribhaashik shabd bhi rahete hai
 Therefore, the editor should have general knowledge or understanding of more and more subjects
 aavashyaktaa hone par kisi anjaane yaa nae vishay ke achche or pramanik granth se yaa uske achche gyaata se bhi sahaayta lenaa aavyashk hota he
 In the task of lexicography, the vision should be very wide and the instinct should be honeycomb
 drushti itani paini or sookshm honi chahie jo sahaj main nir ksheer kaa vivek kar saken or puraani trutiyon, dosha, bhuulon aadi ko dhundkar sahaj main unka sanshodhan tathaa sudhaar kar sake
 In the lexicon, there should also be no partiality or malicious name
 uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy hona chahie bhashaa tathaa sahitya kii seva
 In the lexicon, the primacy is only of meanings and thoughts, so there should not be any spread or overlap in them
 sabhi baaten nappi tuli, maryaadit or yathasadhay sankshipt honi chahie
 The maximum and concrete information in the dictionary should be presented in minimum words
 phaltu yaa bharti kii baton ke liye kosh main sthaan nahin hota
 Some forms of words are normative and many forms are spatial or provincial
 jin sthanik yaa prantiy shabdon ke maanak rup praapt hon, unka sara vivechan unheen maanak shabdon ke antargat rahanaa chahie or unke sthanik yaa prantiy roopon ke aage unke maanak roopon kaa abhidesh maatr hona chahie
 This has the great advantage that other linguists readily learn the standard form of the words and help the standard form of the language to be constant — that the form of the language is not deteriorated by the unfamiliar
 yahi baat aise sanskrit shabdon ke sambandh main bhi honi chahie jiske bahut se paryaay hon
 Like lotus, river, mountain, sea etc
 shabdon ke aage unke paryaay dete samay bhi is baat kaa dhyaan rahanaa chahie ki paryaay vahi die jaae jo mul shabd kaa thik aashay yaa maap bataanevaale hon
 It is advisable to abandon those environments in such contexts, due to which confusion may arise
 koshkaron ke saamne idhar haal main webster kii new world dictionari ne ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he jo bahut hi upyogi tathaa upadey hone ke kaaran shabdkoshon ke liye vishesh anukaraniya he
 It also shows the subtle differences of similar resemblances to them under several words, such as - subtle differences of dread, frit, alarms, disme, terrer and panic are also mentioned under the fear
 aisa yah soch kaa kiya gaya he ki koshkar kaa kaam shabdon ke arth batala dene se hi samaapt nahin ho jaataa, varan isse bhi aage badhkar uskaa kaam logon ko shabdon ke thik prayog batalaana hota he
 We will find hundreds of thousands of such words, whose subtle differences can be revealed, and thus the curious can be made to think about the words in a new way
 haal ke achche or bade angareji koshon main ek or nai tathaa upyogi paripati chali he jo bhartiya bhashaaon ke koshon ke liye vishesh rup se upyogi ho sakati he
 In all languages, there are many compound words which are formed by prefixing
 kanishtha se akanishtha, karaniya se akaraniya, apekshit se anpekshit, aavashyak se anaavashyak, mantri se upamantri, samiti se upasmiti, paalan se paripaalan, bhraman se paribhraman, karm se pratikarm, vidhaan se pratividhan aadi
 The number of such words formed by the sum of prefixes is very large
 aise shabdon do virgon main bante hote hai athwa baante ja sakate hai
 For one, the words whose words are not combined with any new or specific meaning in the former verse and the answer word, which is why they live under ordinary words
 aise shabdon or unke arthon se kosh kaa kalevar bahut bad jaataa he
 To avoid this kind of meaningless expansion, this new method has been adopted in the new dictionaries of Webster that they are not considered as independent words and hence their meanings have not been taken
 prishth ke ant main ek rekha ke neeche aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de di gai he, yatha-an-dizyrd, an-disterbd, an-free, an-hart, an-invited aadi
 Yes, unlike these, there are certain words of other class in which some new meanings are derived from the addition of prefixes
 jaise visheshan rup main akach kaa rup bina balonvala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah ketu grah kaa bhi ek naam he
 Anagar means not only a householder, but in noun form he is also a signifier of a monk
 isaliye aise shabd lenaa aavashyak hota he
 The words whose meanings are automatically destroyed by the sum of predecessor and post-apocalyptic, it is considered futile to take meaning in the dictionary
 at: prishthant main aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de dena yathesht hoga
 Yes, the compound words in which a new and special meaning is derived from the sum of the two terms, it is necessary to take them in the same place as the meaning
 hamaare yahan ke puraane sanskrit koshon kii paddati yah rahi he ki ati, prati sah aadi ke yoga se bananevaale shabd apane purv padwale shabd ke antargat ek hi sheershak main ek saath de die jate he
 Some dictionaries of Hindi have also followed this practice
 yadhyapi sanskrit vyakaran kii drushti se yah paddati yuktisangat hoti he, phir bhi sanskrit koshon tak main inkaa puraa puraa paalan hota hua nahin dikhaai detaa
 There is some saving of space in this, but it becomes very difficult for exceptional readers to find the words
 kabhi kabhi to aise logon ke liye bhi is paddati se shabd dhoondhna kathin hota he jo iske niyamon or siddhanton se bahut kuch parichit hote hai
 In every language, there are some words which are also invariant, adverbs, adjectives, suffix nouns etc
 with the idea of different meanings and are also derived from different roots, ie Hindi is also a noun, adjective and suffix
 Too
 apane sangya rup main bhi vah apane kai arthon main kuch alag alag mulon se vyutpann he
 Such words are considered to be separate and independent words in modern and superior English lexicons and are treated with different titles, viz
 English also has a vise adjective, noun and suffix also and in three forms its titles are kept separately

 By accepting me as a cusp and begging me for knowledge, Hanuman Ji said - o Bhim Sen came first Satyuga, the desire that came to mind in him was made to be so that is why Ta Yuga used to say that there was no harm to religion in this, after that Treta Yuga came, in this Yuga it became the successor to do Yag, therefore it was called Treta Yuga, people used to get Karma fruits by doing Karma in Treta Yuga, o Bhima Sen then Dwapar The era came, in this age, there have been 4 parts of the vidas, and the lug Sat has become corrupt, they have started wandering from the path of religion

 yah da book of van thoznd and van nit kii kai kathaon main se ek he va sabase adhik vikhyath he haalaanki ise sangrah main 18ve shatabdi main antony galand naamak ek francisi ne samavisht kiya tha
 Aladdin is a common poor boy living in the Chinese city
 ek din magareb se aayaa ek jaadugar swayan ko uske gujarey hue pita mustafaa darzi kaa bhai bataa kar apan saath niyukt kar letaa he jis kaaran uski maan ko yah prathit hota he kii vah aage chalakar ek bahut amir vyapaaree banegaa
 But the real purpose of the magician is to seduce Aladdin and obtain a magic lamp from him which is present in a magical cave
 jaadugar alladin ko dhokaa dene kii koshish karata he jisase alladin gupha main funs jaataa he
 Due to good luck, he has a magic ring that was given to him by the magician
 jab hataash hokar alladin apane haath ghisata he tab anjaane main usase anguthi bhi ghis jaati he or ek jinn prakat hota he jo use apni maan ke paas ghar pahunchaa detaa he
 When Aladdin's mother tries to clean the lamp brought by the son, another powerful genie appears who is the slave of the owner of that lamp
 chiraag se nikle jinn kii sahaayta se alladin behad aamir va shaktishaalee ban jaataa he or rajkumaari badr-ul-budur se nikaah kar letaa he
 badr-ul-budur in Hindi means Poonam ka Chandi Poonam
 jinn alladin ke liye ek mahal kaa nirmaan karata he jo shahenshaah ke mahal se bhi kai guna zyaada bhavy hota he
 One day the magician acquires a magic lamp from Aladdin's wife on the pretext of giving a new lamp instead of the old lamp
 vah jin ko hukum detaa he ki mahal ko uske saare sajo saaman sahat apane ghar magareb pahunchaa de
 Luckily, Aladdin still has the magic ring from which he summons the younger genie
 haalaanki chota jinn chiraag ke jinn dwaara kiya gaya jaadu ulat nahin saktaa par vah alladin ko magareb pahunchaa detaa he jahaan alladin ladaai main jaadugar ko maar kar chiraag ko punah hasil kar letaa he va mahal or rajkumaari ko punah apni jagah le aata he
 The sorcerer's powerful younger brother tries to avenge his brother by killing Aladdin and disguises an old woman known for her mysterious magical powers
 badr-ul-budur uske is jhaanse main funs jaati he ayyaar budhiya ko mahal main rahane kii anumati de detii he
 Chirag's genie warns Aladdin about this and Aladdin kills Bahrupia
 sabhi log aage chalakar ek khushhaal zindagi jite he or bhavishya main alladin shahenshaah ban jaataa he
 All conversions match the real story somewhere

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 Then the proportion in which prices rise does not change in the same proportion of poverty, due to which a large number of people continue to fall in the cycle of poverty; then should people be satisfied with this; now that they are above the poor line Have come? While the rich are becoming more rich in front of their eyes, why do those people remain in the same condition? bharat ke aantarik kshetra jo vikaas se dur he tathaa ilaake jo aaj maowad se grast he ve isi nirdhantaa se grast he

 Mr
 Ghasiram Vyas of Maithilisharan Gupta's area was also his friend and also a freedom fighter, he has also made invaluable contribution in the independence of the country, but despite his being such a great nationalist in his life, his contribution was not appreciated
 He made an invaluable contribution in the Hindi world, which cannot be denied

 'bharat-bharti', maithilisharan guptaji dwaara swadesh prem ko darshaate hue vartmaan or bhavi durdasha se ubarne ke liye samaadhaan khojane kaa ek safal prayog kaha ja saktaa he
 bharatiya-bharati, the poetic presentation of Bharat Darshan, certainly cannot be undermined by any research
 maithilisharan gupt ji ne 5 moulik naatak likhe hai- ‘anagha’, ‘chandrahaas’, ‘tilottama’, ‘niskriy pratirodh’ or ‘visarjan’
 He has translated four of Bhasa's plays - 'swapnavasavadatta', 'pratima', 'abhishek', 'avimarka'
 in naatakon main ‘anagha’ jataka katha se sambaddh bodhisattva kii katha par aadhaarit padya main likhaa gaya naatak he
 It cannot be called a 'poetic drama' from a very technical point of view
 ‘chandrahaas’ itihaas kaa abhas utpann karne vaala naatak he
 In which the importance of destiny and truth is communicated
 tilottama puranic naatak he

 The analysis and interpretation of the organ suffixes of any language is called grammar
 vyakaran vah vidya he jiske dwaara kisi bhashaa kaa shuddh bolnaa, shuddh padhanaa or shuddh likhnaa aata he
 There are definite rules for writing, reading and speaking of any language
 bhashaa kii shuddhta va sundarataa ko banaae rakhane ke liye in niyamon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak hota he
 These rules also come under grammar
 vyakaran bhashaa ke adhyayan kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he
 The analysis and analysis of the organ suffixes of any "language" is called "grammar", such as the analysis and interpretation of the body part suffix "physiology" and the description of a country, etc
 "geography"
 yani vyakaran kisi bhashaa ko apane aadesh se nahin chalaata ghumata, pratyut bhashaa kii sthiti pravriti prakat karata he
 "moves" is a verb and everyone reads it the same way without reading grammar; Let's understand its true meaning
 vyakaran is pad kaa vishleshan karke batayega ki isamen do avyav hai - "chalata" or "he"
 Then he will also analyze these two ingredients and tell that "chala" and "hai" also have their components
 "chal" main do varna spasht hai; parantu vyakaran spasht karegaa ki "c" main do akshar he "ch" or "a"
 Similarly "L" and "A" in "L"
 ab in aksharon ke tukade nahin ho sakate; "akshar" hai ye
 Grammar will also classify these letters, "consonants" and "vowels"
 "ch" or "l" vyanjan hai or "a" swar
 The vowels in Chi, Chi and Li, Li are "I" and "E", consonants "ch" and "L"
 is prakaar kaa vishleshan bade kaam kii cheez he; vyarth kaa gorakhdhandha nahin he
 This analysis is "grammar"
 vyakaran kaa doosraa naam "shabdanushasan" bhi he
 He disciplines words - tells us how to use a word
 bhashaa main shabdon kii pravriti apni hi rahati he; vyakaran ke kehane se bhashaa main shabd nahin chalate
 But according to the tendency of the language, grammar dictates word usage
 yah bhashaa par shashan nahin karata, uski sthitipravriti ke anusaar lokshikshan karata he
 Although multi-nadhis, however, Patha Putra Grammar
 swajano shwajano maabhutsakalan shakalan sakrutshkrut
 Read it so that 'kinsman' does not become 'dog' and 'gross' does not become 'face' and 'active' does not become 'powerful'
 ) Where was the first "grammar" science born in the world? sansar ke bhashavidon ne ekamat se sweekaar kiya he ki is prithvi par uplabdh sahitya main sabase pracheen veda he
 The Rigveda is the oldest literature in the world
 jab koi bhashaa sahitya kii samruddhi se jagamagane lagati he, tab uske vyakaran kii jarurat padati he
 What important literature is "veda", it can be understood from this that man has embraced it for so many days and has protected it like life
 uske prayek mantra ko yathasthit rup main kanthsth rakhana or bahut kuch uski "dhwani" surakshit rakhana saral kaam nahin he
 The ascetic Brahmins have protected the Vedas by chewing dried gram
 tabhi to ve bane rahe
 Grammar of important literature like Vedas was needed
 vyakaran ke sahare sudur desh pradeshon ke gyanpipasu kahin anyatra udbhut sahitya ko samaj sakate hai or anant kaal biit jane par bhi log use samajhane main sakasham rahete hai
 Literature like Vedas is not bound by the boundaries of the country; Hence enlightened "dev" people prayed to their king- "the grammar of our language should be formed
 aap hamaari bhashaa kaa vyakaran bana den
 "till then the Vedbhasha was" avyakrita "; this is how people were using it
 indra ne "varam" kahkar devon kii prarthana sweekaar kar lee or phir padon ko bich se tod todakar prakruti pratyay aadi kaa bhed kiya-vyakaran ban gaya
 Thus the first "grammar" lore in India was born
 vyakaran se bhashaa kii gati nahin rukati, jaisaa pehle kaha gaya he; or na vyakaran se vah badalati hi he
 Does the geography of a country state change its movement there? Language moves at its own pace
 vyakaran uskaa na niamak he, na avarohak hi
 Yes, after thousands of years, when a language comes in some other form, then that grammar becomes unusable for this
 tab is kaa pruthak vyakaran banegaa
 That old grammar will still not become useless; Will continue to give an accurate introduction to that old language
 yah saadhaaran upyogita nahin he
 Yes, if someone makes the grammar of a language wrong by his ignorance, then it will be wrong
 bhashaa uskaa anugaman na karegi or yon us vyakaran ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karne par bhi bhashaa ko koi galat na kah degaa
 a grammar of Sanskrit also rules the term "punkshu" with "punsu"; But he was left there
 kabhi kisi ne "punkshu" nahin likhaa bolaa
 Panini described the word "sage" as monk; Like "labor" "rest"
 parantu sanskrit sahitya main "vishram" chalata rahaa; chal rahaa he or chalata rahegaa
 Language has a tendency
 jab panini hi bhashaa ke pravaah ko na roak sake, to dusron kii ginati hi kya
 Grammar and linguistics are two terms; The scope of the two is different; But both are partners of each other
 vyakaran padprayog maatr par vichaar karata he; jab ki bhashavigyaan "pad" ke mul rup kii utpatti vyutpatti yaa vikaas kii paddati batalaata he
 The grammar will state that the form of "no" becomes "a" or "an"
 vyanjanadi shabdon main "a" or swaradi main "an" hota he - "adwitiya", "anupam"
 When there is dominance in prohibition, then there is no concourse - "brahmin naasti", "asya upma nasti"
 anyatra "abrahmana: vedadhyayane mandadaraa: santi" or "anupaman kashmirsaundarya drushtam" aadi main samaas hoga; kyonki nishedh vidheyatmak nahin he
 The grammar will tell the compound and where the compound will be fine, not where; All this is the work of Batalana "sahitya Shastra"
 "na" se vyanjan udhakar "a" rah jaataa he or varnatya se "an" ho jaataa he
 This "an" has been recited by the Hindi for "samas" in the form of "an" - "anhoni", "unknown" etc
 "na" ke ye vividh rup vyakaran bana nahin detaa; bane banaae roopon kaa vah "anvakhyaan" bhar karata he
 It is the work of linguistics to shed light on these forms of "no"
 vyakaran batalaayegaa ki kisi dhaatu se "na" bhavvaachak pratyay karke usamen hindi kii sangyavibhakti "aa" laga dene se bhavvaachak sangyaayen ban jaati hai-aana, janaa, uthanaa, baithna aadi
 But the function of grammar is not to explain the evolution of metals like come, go, rise, sit etc
 yah kaam bhashavigyaan kaa he
 In Sanskrit such nouns are used in the eunuch class - Adhinavam, Gamanam, Utthanam, Upavashanam etc
 parantu hindi main puprayog hota he-"aapkaa aana kab hua?" hindi ne puprayog kyon kiya, yah vyakaran na batayega
 He will fill in the rhyme - "such nouns hold a masculine form" Enough! It is linguistic work to explain why this happened! jab koi bhashaa kisi duusari bhashaa se koi shabd leti he, to use apane shashan main chalaati he - apane vyakaran ke anusaar uski gati niyantrit karti he
 The word "dhoti" in Hindi went to English, so there it had to introduce English grammar
 prayog hota he angreji main - "brinrag avar dhotij"
 The plural of "dhoti" will not work there
 "bring avar dhotiyaan" prayog vahaan galat samajha jayega
 Similarly, the Hindi word "foot" was taken by Hindi and kept under his rule
 angreji main "foot" kaa bahuvachan "feet" hota he; par hindi main angreji vyakaran na chalegaa
 Used - "four feet height", "four feet height" is incorrect
 "oonchaai" bhi galat he; "unchaai" shuddh he
 Is the "height"; Not "low altitude"
 sanskrit main ikarant shabdon ke dwivachan ikarant ho jate hai- "kavi samagtau"; hindi main aisa na hoga
 Will be called "two poets came"
 isi tarah sanskrit main "rajdpanti samagtau"
 "rajdampati" everywhere in Hindi
 parkeey shabdon ko aatmsaat karne kii yah bhi ek prakriya he ki anamel rup ko kaat chhantakar apane mail kaa bana lenaa
 The Hindi word "ganga Ji" went to English; By creating "ganzies"
 angreji "lenturn" shabd hindi ne liya; par "laalaten" banaakar or "hospital" ko "aspataal" banaakar
 "hospital" is also incorrect in Hindi
 "hospital" or "doctor" jaise rup hindi ko grahya nahin
 The grammar of Hindi will regulate that there is no pronunciation in Hindi, which is manifested by placing the reverse tone on the vowel
 yahan "master" kii hi tarah doctor" chalata he
 Yes, if you want to write English language in Nagari script then it will work in reverse - The Doctor Was Fullish "
 isi tarah nagari main farsi jaisi bhashaa likhni ho to "bazaar", "jarurat" aadi rup rahenge; par hindi main neeche bindi na rahegi - "jaruri chizon ke liye bazaar he
 "even if you write Urdu lions, you will get down
 shabdon kaa yah rupanirdhaaran vyakaran ke varna prakaran se hoga
 Mirza Wazir Ali Khan was the fourth Nawab Wazir Al Mamlik a Avadh
 chaar maah ke shashan kaal ke andar hi unhen angrezon or apni praja, donon hi dwaara vilag kar diya gaya or antat unhen padchyut kar ke chunaar ke kile main bandi banaaya gaya or vahiin unka dehanth hua
 Whenever there is talk of first revolution against the British in slave India in India, the picture of 1857 or so around in our mind starts to emerge but very few people will know that 58 years from 1857
 First in 1799, Nawab Wazir Ali Khan raised the flag of revolt against the British from Benares itself
 haalaanki itihaas ke saath hue ched chhaad se ye taarikh hamaari aane vaali naslon ko shaayad hi padhne ko mili yaa jaan bujh ke ise itihaas ke panno se mitaa diya gaya he par un shaheedon ke khun ke katare or kuch khuddar log ise qurabaani ko aaj tak yaad kiye hue hai
 This rebellion began from 21 January 1799, when the British accused Nawab Wazir Ali Khan, the adopted son of Nawab asaf-ud-daula, of cheating and removed him from the throne and sent him to Benares
 vajeer ali ke jagah par unke chachaa saadat ali khan ko avadh kaa aglaa nawab chunaa gaya or vajeer ali ko ramnagar main najarband kar diya gaya
 He was paid one and a half lakh rupees as British penson and the then Governor General Sir John Shore ordered that Wazir Ali should not be allowed to roam or meet anyone
 18 saal kii umr main hi jhute iljaam ke buniyaad par takht chin jane ke buniyaad pe vajeer ali ko angrejon se nafrat ho gayi thi or unhone angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat karne kaa man hi man kasam khaayi



 The British came next order, in which they were asked to send the British headquarters to Kolkata from Banaras
 is baat ne vajeer ali kii nafrat ke aag ko or bhadkaa di or unhone apane vafaadaar sipahasalaron izzat ali or vaaris ali ko bulaava bheja or gupachup tareeke se 200 sipaahiyon kaa lashkar bhi taiyaar kar liya
 This war began on 14 January 1799
 vajeer ali ne khud ko banaras se hataane ke faisle ke khilaaf tatkaaleen commander george fredrick cheri se milane kii khwaahish jaahir kii
 At this Cherry agreed
 vajeer ali apane sipahasaalar izzat ali or varis ali ke saath cheri ke mint house sthit ghar pe apane laav lashkar ke saath pahuche
 During the conversation, they attacked the army of the Nawab, which was already ready, surrounded the commander camp and captured the sentries
 baagiyon ne commander cheri,captain kanave,robert graham ,captain greg ivance sahit saat angrej sipaahiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 The blood on his head was so strong that the rebels decided to wipe out the entire camp
 commander ke ghar se kuch dur nadesar kshetra main tatkaaleen magistrate em

 Davis hides his wife, children and two servants on the roof and comes out himself to fight the rebels
 chhatpar jane vaale seedhee ke peeche baithkar davis ne baagiyon ko kaaphi der tak roke rakhaa
 The news of the British rebellion spread like fire and the British army reached Nadesar to save the magistrate
 haalaanki phir baagiyon ko peeche hatana padaa or in vakton main nawab ke saath or bhi hajaaron baagi jud gaye
 To crush the rebellion of the Nawab, General Arskin from Kolkata had to come to Benares with an army
 arsakin ke baari fuj ke aage baagi tik nahin paae
 Hundreds of people were killed, seeing no way to escape, they all planned to leave from there with mutual consent
 Wazir Ali also reached Butwal, Rajasthan to save his life
 tab jaipur ke tatkaaleen angrej parast raja ne unhipane yahan thaharne kii daavat di
 He betrayed the Nawab and handed over Wazir Ali to the British in 1799
 angrejon ne vajeer ali ko kolkata ke fort wiliam jail bhej diya
 The Nawab died in prison in 1817 after spending 17 years in prison

 The crocodile was trapped in a fisherman's net which the fisherman sent to the kitchen of Shambarasur
 jab us magaramchh kaa pet phada gaya to usamen se ati sundar balak niklaa
 Seeing her, Shambarasur's maid Mayawati was not surprised
 vah us balak ko paalane lagi
 At the same time Devarshi Narada reached Mayawati and said, o Mayawati! This is your husband Cupid
 isane yadukul main janm liya he or ise shambrasur samudr main daal aayaa tha
 You take care of it diligently
 itnaa kah kar naarad ji vahaan se chale gayi
 The child was named Pradyumna
 thode hi kaal main pradhyumna yuva ho gaya
 Pradyuman's form Lavanya was so amazing that he appeared to be only Shri Krishna Chandra
 rati unhen bade bhav or lajili drushti se dekhati thi
 Then Pradyuman ji said that you have taken care of me like a mother, then why am i seeing such a change in you? Then Rati said - "itnaa kah kar mayawati rati ne unhen maha vidya pradaan kiya tathaa dhanush baan, astr-shastr aadi sabhi vidyaon main nipun kar diya
 On becoming proficient in the field of warfare, Pradyumna went to the assembly of Shambarasura, armed with weapons
 shambrasur unhen dekhakar prasann hua or sabhaasadon se kaha ki is balak ko maine paal posh kar bada kiya he
 Pradyuman said on this, hey wicked! i am not your child but you are the enemy whom you threw into the sea
 ab tu mujhase yuddh kar
 "upon hearing these words of Pradyumna, Shambarasur got very angry and made a heavy mace like Shambarasur on him
 pradhyumna ne us gade ko apane gade se kaat diya
 Then the Asura created many types of Maya and started to fight, but Pradyuman destroyed his Maya using Mahavidya and cut off the head of Shambarasura with his sharp sword and put it on earth
 unke is parakram ko dekh kar devataganon ne unki stuti kar akaash se pushp varsha kii
 Then Mayawati brought Rati Pradyumna to Dwarikapuri by sky route
 gauravarna patni ke saath saanwale pradhyumna ji kii shobhaa avarnaneey thi
 " ve nav-dampati shri krishna ke antahpur main pahunche
 All the women there, including Rukmini, were surprised to see Pradyumna, the replica of Lord Krishna
 ve sochane lageen ki yah nar shreshth kiskaa putr he? na jane kyon ise dekh kar meraa vatsalya umad rahaa he
 My child too would grow up to be like this, but who would have picked him up from the hymn
 usee samay shri krishna bhi apane mata-pita devaki or vasudev tathaa bhai balram ke saath vahaan aa pahunche
 Shri Krishna was a transcendent, but he had to perform male leela, so he remained ignorant about the child
 tab devarshi naarad ne vahaan aakar sabhi ko pradhyumna kii adyopant katha sunai or vahaan upasthit samast janon ke hriday main harsh vyaapt gaya
 Courtesy of Sukhsagar vyaktitv kii do parasparavirohi athwa sarvatha bhinn shaileyon kaa uski ek hi ikai main apni pruthak satta surakshit rakhte hue, ikatthe rahane kaa bodh dvivyaktitv he
 They are well organized and organized even while being surrounded by a single person; Neutral and oblivious to each other

 The disharmony of our own different forms of perception makes people surprised by appearing in practice
 sarvatha virdohi aacharnon se uske saamaajik sambandh lagaataar baadhit evam vyatikramit hote hai, tut jate hai
 Diabetics become a clinical subject of mental therapy
 ye vyaktitv-khand do se zyada bhi hote he
 They also bear many names - polytheism, fragmented personality; Disconnected personality, transferred and transferred personality etc
 lokkathaon tath sahitya main aise vyaktitv parivartan ke drushtaant milte hai
 Robert Louis Stevenson's famous novel 'dr
 Jokil and Mr
 Hyde also discusses psychologists in this context
 chini lokkatha main ek vyakti jangal main so jaataa he; sote hi sher ban jaataa he tathaa apane hi bandhu ko maar daalata he
 Upon arriving in his former form, he regrets the death of the brother without knowing that it is his own act
 paraspar virdohi vrittiyaan athwa unka ek hi vyakti main praapt hona manovigyaan kya, samanya gyaan ke liye bhi nai vastu nahin
 Yung's 'introverted' and 'extroverted' personality-type and blurr's perceived 'introverted' person's instinct - 'duality', etc
 are famous
 manorog main bhi kreshchamar sammat 'sijaed' tathaa 'cyclaayed', creplin kathith utsaah vishaad manochakr tathaa manovidalata yaa manohras aadi ke nirupan samshti main isi ek tathy kii pushti karte hai ki vyakti main man: shakti ko bahari jagat se sambhddha karaane kii vidhayak-vritti tathaa bahya jagat se khinchakar kachhue kii bhanti antarjagat main sikod lene kii nishedhaatmak vritti, donon hi kaam karti rahati hai
 a relatively more predominant one is representative of the 'type' of personality
 'dwaidhbhav' main kabhi to donon vrittiyon kaa santulan rahata he, jo ki adarsh sthiti hoti he, kabhi donon ore baari-baari besakhta dhul jane kii sthiti hoti he
 The last is 'dualism' in its peak

 macdougall criticized 'dualism', saying that it can never be placed on the practical standard of living of ordinary people because in special circumstances it lies in us as a hidden possibility; On the contrary, it can be said that every human mind is single and organized perfection
 dow prince ke purv elicot ne sarvapratham tak aise rogi kaa vaigyanik vivaran prakashit kiya tathaa po ne sarvapratham 76 rogiyon ke drushtaanton kaa sahitya prastut kiya
 Subsequent psychologists placed less emphasis on 'blocks' and more on mental unity
 upchetan kii sarvatha alag kati manobhumi kii vakaalat karne ke liye frid kii teevr aalochanaayen hui hai kintu prasiddh frydwadi arnest jones isi algaav ko kuch sameep laata hua kahata he ki hamaari damit vasanaye jo mulat: yon prakruti kii hoti hai apana ek swatantra vikaas karne lagati he or kabhi kabhi itani teevr ban jaati hai ki kuch kaal ke liye chetan dharaatal par bhi prabhutv jamaa leti hai

 In the story style of Yung, Chaitanya becomes impotent in front of the sovereignty arising in 'unconscious'

 This also leads to emergence of accidental eccentricities in everyday life

 In his literature, Yung has analyzed the word Sanskrit 'duality' at many places in this sense
 pretvidyavid tathaa para-manovaigyanik ek sookshmatma kii kalpana karte hai jo is prakaar kii vyaktitv-dwaidhata utpann karti hai 
 This ideology has not yet given satisfaction to the scientific world
