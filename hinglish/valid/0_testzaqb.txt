 a major branch of virology is viral taxonomy
 vishaanuon ko unke dwaara sankramit hue host ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaasakata he: pashu vishaanu, padap vishaanu, kavak vishaanu, bactereophej, ityadi
 Other classifications are based on the geometric shape of their capsid or on the basis of the structure of the virus
 vishaanuon kaa aakaar 30nm se lekar 450nm tak hota he
 Therefore, most viruses cannot be seen by ordinary microscopes

 varan bhinn vishaanu samoohon ke vikasshil sambandh abhi bhi aspasht hai
 There are three hypotheses about their origin: yah bilkul sambhav he, ki bhinn vikalp, bhinn vishaanu samoohon par lagu hote hai
 Here it is appropriate to refer to Mimivirus, a large virus that infects amoebae; Which holds most of the molecular machinery, which is associated with bacteria
 kya yah paraseete procaryot kaa sarlikrut rup he, yaa ki yah ek saral vishaanu rup main udgam hua, jisane apane host ke jin le liye? The evolution of viruses, which usually occurs along the evolution of its host, is studied under viral sequence development
 jabaki vishaanu prajnan va vikaas karte hai, phir bhi unamem chayapachay nahin hota he, va apane host koshika par prajnan hetu nirbhar hai
 One of the main motivations for studying viruses is the fact that they cause many infectious diseases
 in rogon main jukham, influenza, rabies, khasra, dast ke kai rup, hepatitis, yelo fever, polio, chechak tathaa aids tak aate hai
 Many viruses, called oncoviruses, also contribute to many cancers
 kai up-vishaanu kan bhi rog kaa kaaran hai, jaise kuru rog evam sreuzfalt-jaikab kaa kaaran hai praayan, hepatitis-di kaa nimitt he ek upgrah vishaanu| The study of the style in which viruses cause disease is called viral pathogenesis or viral pathogenesis
 jis shrenee tak koi vishaanu rog karata he, use "virulence kehete hai| When the immune system of a vertebrate organism encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies or antibodies, which bind the virus and destroy it for destruction
 The presence of these antibodies is sometimes tested to know whether a person has been infected by the virus in the past
 One of such tests is ELISA or ELISA
 Vaccination is beneficial to prevent viral diseases, in which a person's body is already injected with, or built into them
 Specialized monoclonal antibodies can also be used to test for the presence of viruses, known as fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence microscopy

 Bacteriophages sometimes transfer genetic material from one bacterium to another through the process of translocation
 And this horizontal gene transfer is one of the main reasons that he became the principal research tool in the early development of molecular biology
 The genetic code, functions of the ribosome, the first regenerative DNA or recombinant DNA and the early genetic library, all used bacteriophages
 Certain genetic components derived from viruses, such as highly effective promoters, are commonly used today in molecular biology research
 jivit host se baahar pashu vishaanuon kaa vardhan ativ kathin he| fertilined chuzon ke andon ko praayah prayog kiya gaya he, kintu koshika sanvardhan aajkal adhiktar prayog main he| Viruses that infect eukaryotes have to transfer their genetic material to the navel of the host cell, so they are useful in inserting new genes into the host
 This is called gene transformation
 Improved retroviruses are often used for this purpose, as they integrate their genes into the host's chromosome

 tadnusaar "falanumeyapramanyawad" ek aisi vichaardhaara he jo gyaan ke sabhi kshetron main uske kriyaatmak prabhaav yaa fal ko ek atyant hi mahatvapurn sthaan detii he
 According to this, all our objective assumptions are the perceptions of their possible practical results

 Purposeism is a new philosophical ideology
 vartmaan yug main darshan evam shiksha ke vibhinn vichaardhaaraon main is vichaardhaara ko sabase adhik manyata praapt he
 Realism is an ideology that was planted in the human mind in very ancient times
 yatharthwaad kisi ek sugathit darshanik vichaardhaara kaa naam na hokar un sabhi vichaaron kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jo yah maanate hai ki vastu kaa astitv swatantra rup se he
 The idealist holds that the existence of an 'object' depends on our knowledge
 yadi yah vichaar sahi he to vastu kii koi sthiti nahin he
 On the contrary, realists believe that the object has independent existence whether it is in our thoughts or not
 vastu tathaa usase sambandhit gyaan donon pruthak-pruthak sattaayen he
 There are many things in the world that we do not know about, but this does not mean that they do not exist at all
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki vastu kii swatantra sthiti he
 Our knowledge makes us aware of his condition, but our knowledge about him does not destroy his existence
 vaise gyaan prapti ke saadhan ke vishay main yathartwaadee, prayojanavaad ke samaan vaigyanik vidhi ko hi sarvottam vidhi maanata he or nigaman vidhi kaa aashray letaa he
 It cannot be said with certainty when the purposeist ideology was born, but still keeping in mind the uniqueness of this ideology, it can definitely be said that since man caused his problems and difficulties and their solutions
 Started thinking about the truth and practicality of the experiences gained from the efforts made for this, since then this ideology has been planted

 Dr
 Schiller has proposed a theory called Humanitarianism which should really be considered a branch of consequentialism
 james kii to praaia: sabhi kritiyaan is vichaardhaara par aadhaarit hai
 James was often a staunch opponent of spiritualism, especially Hegelian spiritualism
 unhen prayogpriy evam bahyavastuvaadi amareeki janata kaa vaicharik pratinidhi kahana anuchit na hoga
 When he was engaged in the idea of a criterion of truth that was entirely different from the metaphysical paradigm, he wrote "how do we make our ideas clear" in an American monthly paper called "pupular Science" in January, 1878
 - Read the article and after finding the basic framework of modern consequentialism, he became convinced that this is the criterion of truth or truth
 peers ko, jaisaa swayan unhone hi kaha he, falanumeyapramanyawad kaa sabhanarthvachi "pregametism" shabd or uskaa bhav donon hi germany ke suprasiddh darshanik kaant kii kritiyon se mili the
 But even while showing the antiquity of this ideology, James considers himself especially grateful to Peers and has honored him as a pioneer of modern consequentialism in philosophy
 jo bhi ho, is siddhant ko bal evam prakhyati pradaan karne main swayan james kaa hi naam sarvopar ullekhneey he
 All the well-known texts such as his "principles of Psychology", "miscellaneous Forms of Religious Experience", "consequentialism", "meaning of Truth" and "the Nine World" support this ideology
 unke na keval taarkik vichaar hi kintu manovaigyanik evam tathvik-sabhi prakaar ke vichaar falanumeyapramanyawaadee pravriti ke suspasht pratik hai
 According to James "truth is the name of all things that prove themselves superior in the way of faith, and also for certain specific things"
 sankshep main, "satya vichaar kii prakriya kaa ek yogya yaa uchit upkaran maatr hota he, thik vaise hi jaise "shubh" hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan kaa ek safal saadhan maatr; vah kisi bhi prakaar se laabhprad or, vastut:, antatogatva tathaa sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhane par laabhadaayak he
 "james considers truth to be the cash value of our personal perceptions, not objective facts
 unke anusaar ham swayan apane satyon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 They are not merely reactions of external objects; But the seekers of our purposes are our only faith
 ham un vishwaason ko jo hamen bhavatmak tripti yaa vyaavhaarik safalataa pradaan karte hai satya maanane lagate hai, or iske vipareet parinamawaalon ko asaty
 Therefore, the veracity of our beliefs or thoughts is permissible by their result or result
 uske sthapit hone ke liye samay or anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Just as we get success in behavior with a belief, so also its truth increases
 hamaare simit anubhav dwaara pramanit hamaari kisi bhi aasthaa ko purnataya satya kahalaane kaa adhikaar nahin, yahan tak ki vigyaan ke tathakthith prakritik niyamon ko bhi purna rup se satya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We have the right to say as much as possible that as far as our experiences are concerned, they have proved to be true; But this does not prove their eternal truth
 purna satya ke liye purna anubhav, jiskaa hona kabhi sambhav nahin, apekshit he
 Therefore, any truth propounded by humans, whether it is scientific or whether it is scientific or logical, cannot be absolute truth
 jinhen praaia: manushya siddh-satya yaa siddhant sajaate hai unhen falanumeyapramanyawaadee keval upakalpana hi maanate hai
 They strongly criticize rationalist logic and corrupt their principles of justice

 The Indian method of testing the truthfulness of knowledge called "tendency, strength and tendencyism", according to which the successor knowledge is considered to be true or false knowledge is inexact or false when it comes into action, resembling this consequential phenomenological method
 parantu, saath hi saath, "tadvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan yathartham" evam tadbhaavvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan bhram:" kahanevaala kattar vastuvaadi nyaayadarshan anurupatavaad kaa samarthak prathit hota he, jab ki james aadi paashchaatya falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon ne uski katu aalochana kii he
 Just as in Satyasatya deliberation, similarly in the interpretation of mental processes or ideas, the consequentialist primevalists give a major place to our practical actions
 unke anusaar, ham na keval apane satyon kaa hi kintu vividh anubhavon kaa bhi nirmaan karte hai
 Our primary or basic experience is like an uninterrupted stream and we divide it into various substances and their interrelationships, inspired by self-interest and self-interest, through our mental actions of analyzing and choosing, etc

 Atomicist psychology is an imitation of the physical science of the same name, which is far from the reality and misleading in the eyes of the consequentialists

 Nevertheless, if any philosophy can be said to be a counterpoint to this ideology, it is the doctrinal principle propounded by Dr
 Schiller in the book "studies in Humanism", supported by Prof
 Dui
 iske anusaar, ham swayan hi sadaiv ek badi had tak or sahi arth main vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality continues to form, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa sambandh he yah nishchay he ki uskaa swaroop nirman, ek atyant mahatvapurn ansh main, hamaar or hamaare us gyaan ke upar nirbhar rahata he jisapar hamaare prayojanon or swaarthon kii chhap anivaaryat lagi rahati he
 Our facts are those in which their Nirmapika have the power or ability to satisfy our desires
 jis prakaar satya hamaare safal vishwaas hote hai usee prakaar tathy hamaari ichchhaaon ko santushti pradaan karanevaale padaarth hote hai
 In short, successful functional effectiveness in our practical life should be understood, according to these thinkers, as a sign of fact or reality
 bhartiya buddha darshan kii sat kii paribhaasha bhi, jiske anusaar "sat vah he jisamen kisi kaary ko utpann karne kii kshamta ho", falanumeyapramanyawaadee vichaardhaara ke anukool prathit hoti he, kyonki usamen bhi vastuon ke sattvaasatva, astitv, anstitv, ke nirdhaaran main unke kaaryrup fal ko hi nirnaayak mana he
 But in many other philosophical matters, all Buddhist philosophers neither agree with each other nor with the modern philanthropist
 ek maanavtaavaadi darshan hone ke kaaran prayojanavaad sansar evam uski vastuon tathaa kriyaaon ke kaarnon par us gambhirtha se vichaar nahin karata jitna maanav jivan main uski upyogita par vichaar karata he
 In order to protect its existence as an independent philosophy, Purposeism has laid down the following basic principles, considering the reasons of the world and its actions, making human the basis
 atah spasht he ki prayojanavaadee kabhi adarshavaadiyon kaa samarthan karte hai to kabhi prakrutivaadiyon kaa
 In this way, they place themselves between these two 'vados'
 prayojanavaadee darshan ‘pragati gami shiksha’ ke aandolan ke rup main prasphutit hua parantu aaj uski safalataa ke sambandh main anek ashankayein uthaai ja rahi hai
 The reason is clear that Purposeism has shown to be imperfect ideology by its uncertain objectives, by giving more importance to the instrument and by rendering principles like creativity in the field of human values
 prayojanavaadee darshan ke sambandh main kuch vichaarneey bindu is prakaar hai – Due to the soft education system, children are not prepared to live real life

 gregorian calendar {gregory kaaldarshak}, duniya main lagbhag har jagah upyog kiya jane vaala kaaldarshak yaa tithipatrak he
 This is the adaptation of the Julian calendar

 Prior to this, the Julian calendar was in vogue, but it contained many errors, which were corrected in the Gregorian calendar
 gregory kaaldarshak kii mul ikai din hota he
 There is a year of 365 days, but every fourth year is of 366 days, which is called leap year
 surya par aadhaarit panchang har 146,097 dinon baad doharaaya jaataa he
 It is divided over 400 years and equals 20871 weeks
 in 400 varshon main 303 varsh aam varsh hote hai, jiname 365 din hote hai
 And there are 97 leap years, consisting of 366 days
 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year
 yah aadhiky 400 varshon main 3 din se kuch adhik ho jaataa he
 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not
 is naveen paddati kaa aarambh chunki pope gregory ne kiya, isliye isko gregorian paddati athwa naveen paddati kaha gaya
 This method was accepted in different Christian countries in different years

 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD
 punah 2000 i0 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hone ke kaaran yah vruddhi 13 din kii hi rahegi, atirikt 1 din nahin badhegaa

 In astronomy, constellations refer to a group of stars appearing in the sky
 itihaas main vibhinn sabhyataaon nen akaash main taron ke bich main kalpit rekhaayen khinchakar kuch akritiyaan prathit kii hai jinhen unhone naam de die
 For example, in ancient India there is a planetarium named Mrigashirsha, which in Greek civilization is called Oraian, which means "hunter"
 pracheen bharat main taramandalon ko nakshatra kaha jaataa tha
 In modern-day astronomy, constellations are called groups of the same stars, which are internationally agreed with the International Astronomical Union
 aadhunik yug main kisi taron ke taramandal ke ird-gird ke kshetra ko bhi usee taramandal kaa naam de diya jaataa he
 Thus the entire celestial sphere has been divided into different constellations
 agar yah bataanaa ho ki koi khagoleey vastu ratri main akaash main kahan milegi to yah bataaya jaataa he ki vah kis taramandal main sthit he
 Keep in mind that stars and other objects appearing in a planetarium may appear close to each other when viewed from the earth, but this is not necessarily the case
 jis tarah dur dekhne par do pahaad ek-duusare ke nazadik lag sakate hai lekin sameep jane par pataa chalata he ke unamem bahut faaslaa he or ek pahaad vastav main duusare pahaad se milon peeche he
 "planetarium" was called "nakshatra" in Sanskrit and in various Indian languages this word is used even today
 taramandal ko angrezi main "constlation" or arabi main "majamua-al-nazoom" kehete hai
 The constellation consists of stars and celestial objects, which, when viewed from the surface of the Earth, are permanently visible in the same area in the sky
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he kii ye vastav main ek-duusare ke paas hai yaa inkaa aapas main koi mahatvapurn gurutvkarshan bandhan he
 In contrast, the stars of the trilateral are actually in a cluster and have a gravitational bond between themselves

 His plays are considered equivalent to Kalidasa's plays
 bhawabhooti ne apane sambandh main mahaviracharit kii prastaavna main likhaa he
 He was the son of Shri Bhattagopal, resident of a place called 'padmapur' of Vidarbha country
 inke pita kaa naam nilkanth or mata kaa naam jatukarni tha
 He has given his reference to 'bhattashrikanth Pachachalachhini Bhavabhutiranam'
 inke guru kaa naam 'gyananidhi' tha
 The 'bhatt Sri Kumaril Shishyana Virichit Mind Caseam' and 'bhatt Sri Kumaril Prasadapratapa Vagvaibhavasya Umbekacharyasayya Kriti', found in the ancient copy of Malatimadhava, is known from the mention that Guru Kumaril of Srikanth who was also named 'gyannidhi' and Bhavabhuti was Mimansakam Umbayachar Whose references are found in the philosophy texts and he commented on the verse of the verse of Kumaril Was also sanskrit sahitya main mahan darshanik or naatakkaar hone ke naate ye adwitiya hai
 This unique yoga of erudition and ingenuity is rare in Sanskrit literature
 shankaradigvijay se gyaat hota he ki umbek, mandan sureshwar, ek hi vyakti ke naam the
 One name of Bhavabhuti derives 'umbake', so the dramatists Bhavabhuti, Mimansak Umbake and Dixit Suresvaracharya in Advaitamat are the same, some scholars believe it
 rajtarangini ke ullekh se inkaa samay ek prakaar se nishchit sa he
 These were the presidencies of Yashovarman, the king of Kanyakubj, who was defeated by Lalitaditya
 'gaudwaho' ke nirmaataa vaakyapatiraj bhi usee darbar main the at: inkaa samay aathvin shatabdi kaa purvardh siddh hota he
 Bhavabhuti was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family in Padmapur
 padmapur maharashtra ke gondia jile main maharashtra or madhyapradesh kii seemaa par sthit he
 Silence of Sanskrit poets has become a tradition about himself, but Bhavabhuti has broken this traditional silence and introduced himself in the preface of all three plays
 ‘mahaviracharit’ kaa yah ullekh— From the mention of 'srikantha Padlachanan: Bhavabhirtinam' it appears that Srikanth was the title of the poet and was named Bhavabhuti
 kintu kuch tikaakaron kaa yah vishwaas he ki kavi kaa naam nilkantha tha or bhawabhooti oopaadhi thi, jo unhen kuch vishesh padon kii rachana kii prashansa main mili thi
 In confirmation of this aspect, the commentary of 'mahaviracharit' and 'uttararamcharit', Veer Raghav 1 has presented the interpretation of this sentence in this way- is vyakhya ke anusaar 'shrikanth', bhawabhooti kaa naam tha, kyonki ‘laanchhan’ shabd naam kaa parichaayak he
 'samba Punatu Bhavabhutipavitramurthy:' - Goddess Parvati, who is blessed with the devotion of Shiva, sanctify you - Pleased with the creation of this verse, the king honored her with the title of 'bhavabhuti'
 jagaddhar ‘malti madhav’ kii tikaa main ‘ namna shrikantha; prasiddhya bhawabhootirityarthh’ tathaa tripurari ne bhi isi naatak kii tikaa main ‘bhawabhootirit vyavhaare tasyedan naamantaram’ kahkar isi mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he ki shrikanth kaa naam tha or bhawabhooti prasiddhi tathaa vyavhaar kaa naam tha
 The words of the commentator Ghanshyam of 'uttararamcharit', 'bhavat Shivat Bhuti: Bhasma Sampadasya Ishvairenaiv caste Dwijarupane Vibhutirdatta' - that Bhava himself gave his 'bhuti' to the poet, hence he was called 'bhavabhuti', - confirms this view
 bhawabhooti dwaara rachit teen naatak praapt hote hai - In which the story from Rama Vivaha to the coronation is set

 His style holds the preeminence of speech but not the vagadambar of vain
 prakruti ke ghor or prachand rup kii ore kavi kaa dhyaan adhik he
 At the same time, the poet's dexterity is expressed in the production of sound according to the meaning
 yah ek naatak hi kavi kii pratimaa or paanditya kii abhivyakti ke liye alan he
 He has said - 'eko Ras: Karun and Ava'
 is naatak main anek rason kaa rup dhaaran karke karun ras sahrudayon ke hriday par apana prabhaav chhod jaataa he
 The high and ideal form of love which the poet has distinguished in his play, does not fall with the stage and attains a more complete and sublime form
 sambhavat: yahi kaaran he ki kavi ne nari ke bahya saundarya ke varnan kii ore vishesh dhyaan nahin diya he or uske antahsaundarya ko hi udghaatit kiya he
 With this sanctity of love, in the glory of faith, the importance of the heart, the seriousness of language, and the waveful play of emotions, this play is the same as 'eko Ras: Karun Av' in literature
 paanditya or pratibha ke ghani bhawabhooti ke naatakon main shastron kaa vyapak gyaan, bhashaa kii praudhata, bhav kii garima or nirikshan kii sookshmata ke kaaran sarasata ke sthaan par ganbhiry or udaattata vishesh praapt hoti he
 Probably due to these reasons, the compositions of the poet could not become more popular at that time and his plays could not be acted in any Raj Sabha at that time
 ujjayini main mahakalayatra ke avasar par ekatra puravaasiyon ke samaksh kii unke naatakon kaa abhinay hua or tadnantar ve yashoverma ke rajya main samaadrut hue
