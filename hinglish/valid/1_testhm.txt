 isamen suvidit bhagwaan ram kii katha hi varnit he, phir bhi yah anya ramaayanon kii tarah bhaktipradhan granth na hokar kavy granth hi he
 'ramachandra Chandrika' is the famous work of Keshavdas which is commonly called 'ramachandrika'
 iske rachanakaal kaa spasht ullekh swayan kavi ne grantharambh main kiya he- Thus its creation date is 1601 AD
 iske mul paath kaa sanskaran litho chapai main kanhaiyalaal radhelaal, lakhanu ke dwaara prakashit hua tha
 Its Janaki Prasad commentary was published in 1907 AD from Venkateswara Press, Mumbai and in 1915 AD from Navalkishore Press, Lucknow
 lala bhagavanadin kii aadhunik dhang kii hindi tikaa 'ramchandrika' kii sarvaadhik prasiddh tikaa rahi he
 Deenji's commentary 'ramachandra Chandrika' was published in the first half of Sahitya Sevasadan, Benaras and the latter from Sahitya Bhushan Office, Banaras in 1923
 lalaji kii tikaa kii punraritiyaan san 1929 i0 se ramnarayan laal bukseller, prayag dwaara prakashit hone lageen
 An authentic version of its original text has also been published in the editing of Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra as 'keshava-granthvali, Part-2' from Hindustani Academy, Allahabad
 'ramchandra chandrika' 39 prakaashon main katha suchi sahit 1717 chhandon main puraa hua he
 According to Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra, although the well-known Ramakatha is described in this, it is a poetry of poetry, not of devotion
 keshav 'nimbark sampradaay' main dikshit hone ke naate radha krishna ke upaask the, ram ke nahin
 Although Ramachandrika is a Ramakatha epic, the narrative in it differs from the Valmiki Ramayana and the Ramcharitmanas
 haalaanki kavi ke ullekh ke anusaar is mahakavy ko rachane kii prerana unhen adikavi valmiki se hi mili
 They wrote that is ke purvardh kii katha valmikiy ramayana se kuch-kuch samya bhi rakhata he kintu uttarardh main kavi kii nijee udbhaavna evam vyavastha hi pramukh he
 The poet's erudition is demonstrated through this poetry
 samvaad-yojana, alankaar-yojana, chand-yojana kii drushti se yah kavy kavi ke acharyatv ke kaushal ko hi prastut karata he
 In this, the poet has broken the well-known narrative tradition
 vastutah unhone is granth-rachana main pratyaksh sahyog sanskrit ke 'prasanraghav', 'hanumannatak' aadi granthon se liya he
 'kadambari' also has a clear effect
 naatakon kaa aadhaar lene se or katha bhaag chhod dene se samvaad ke vaktaaon ke naam inhen padya se pruthak rakhane pade hai
 The dialogue-planning is done in a dramatic way, so it can be used with visual simplicity as a special feature
 keshav ke is kavyagranth main bhakthi kii pradhanta na hote hue bhi ram ko avtari mana gaya he tathaa anek sthalon par unase upadesh dilaayaa gaya he
 As a result, the didactic passages have become substantial and poetry has been damaged
 keshav ko reetikaal kaa yuganirmaataa sahityakar tathaa hindi kaa pratham acharya kavi mana gaya he
 From this point of view, the predominance of Acharyatva is also evident in Ramachandrika
 style kii drushti se isamen vividh prakaar ke chhandon ke udhaaharan prastut karne kii pravriti dikhaai padati he
 It seems that poets are teaching someone the method of pingle
 ramchandrika kii bhashaa sanskritpradhan brajabhasha he
 Due to excessive use of Sanskrit words and the miracle of ornamentation, the composition has become cumbersome and annoying
 is granth main kavi kii sahrudayata se kahin adhik panditya kaa pradarshan prabal he
 In the words of Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra, it undoubtedly expresses the great piety and acharya of Keshava
 pracheen hindi sahitya kaa marmajna hone ke liye ramchandra chandrika kaa adhyayan nirvivaad rup se anivaary he
 It has an important place in Hindi literature

 indra kii sandehbhari baton ko sunakar naradji ne kaha-he aditiputra indra! ek samay kii baat he
 That evil Kansa asked an astrologer that the best astrologer among Brahmins! How and by whom i will die jyotishi bole-he daanvon main shreshth kansa! vasudev kii dharmapatni devaki jo vakpatu he or aapaki bahan bhi he
 His eighth son born from his womb, who will defeat enemies and become famous in this world as 'krishna', will kill you at sunrise
 jyotishi kii baaten sunakar kansa ne kaha- he daivaj, budhimaanon main agrany ab aap yah bataaen ki devaki kaa aathvaan putr kis maas main kis din meraa vadh karegaa
 Astrologer said- o Maharaj! On the Shukla Paksha of Magh month, you will have a fight with Shri Krishna, full of sixteen arts
 usee yuddh main ve aapkaa vadh karenge
 That's why, Your Highness! You protect yourself diligently
 itnaa bataane ke pashchaat naradji ne indra se kaha- jyotishi dwaara bataae gaye samay par hikans kii mrityukrishna ke haath nihsandeh hogi
 Then Indra said- o Muni! Describe the story of that vicious Kansa and tell how Krishna will be born and how Kansa will be killed by Krishna
 indra kii baton ko sunakar naradji ne punah kahana prarambh kiya- us duraachaari kansa ne apane ek dwarpal se kaha- meri is praanon se priy bahan kii purna suraksha karnaa
 The gatekeeper said - this will happen
 kansa ke jane ke pashchaat uski choti bahan duhkhit hote hue jal lene ke bahaane gadaa lekar talab par gai
 Devaki started crying after sitting under a pouring tree on the banks of that pond
 usee samay ek sundar stri jiskaa naam yashoda tha, usne aakar devaki se priy vaani main kaha- he kante! is prakaar tum kyon vilaap kar rahi ho
 Tell me the reason for your crying
 tab duhkhit devaki ne yashoda se kaha- he bahan! neech karmon main aasakt duraachaari meraa jyeshtha bhrata kansa he
 That evil brother killed many of my sons
 is samay mere garbh main aathvaan putr he
 He will kill it too
 is baat main kisi prakaar kaa sanshay yaa andeh nahin he, kyonki mere jyeshtha bhrata ko yah bhay he ki mere ashtum putr se uski mrityu avashya hogi
 Hearing Devaki's words, Yashoda said - o sister! Don't moan main bhi garbhvatee hoon
 If i am a girl, then you should take that girl instead of your son
 is prakaar tumhaara putr kansa ke haathon maaraa nahin jayega
 Subsequently Kansa asked his gatekeeper - where is Devaki? She is not visible at the moment
 tab dwarpal ne kansa se namravaani main kaha- he maharaj! aapaki bahan jal lene talab par gai hui hai
 Kansa got angry on hearing this and asked the gatekeeper to go to the same place where she has gone
 dwarpal kii drushti talab ke paas devaki par padi
 Then she said what is the reason you came here
 uski baaten sunakar devaki ne kaha ki mere grih main jal nahin tha, jise lene main jalashay par ai hoon
 After this, Devaki went towards her home
 kansa ne punah dwarpal se kaha ki is grih main meri bahan kii tum purnatah raksha karo
 Now Kansa felt so afraid that inside the house the huge locks were locked in the doors and outside the door, the demons and the demons were appointed to guard
 kansa har prakaar se apane praanon ko bachaane ke prayaas kar rahaa tha
 Once upon a time, the zodiacal clouds established their dominance in the sky of the Leo sun
 bhadon maas kii krishnapaksh kii ashtami tithi ko ghanghor ardhratri thi
 At that time the Moon was also in Taurus, Rohini Nakshatra on Wednesday, fortunately, when the combined moon rises in the middle of the night at midnight, when a clock is held in the midnight, then the fruit of shruti-smriti Puranokta is undoubtedly received
 is prakaar bataate hue naradji ne indra se kaha- aise vijay naamak shubh muhoort main shrikrishna kaa janm hua or shrikrishna ke prabhaav se hi usee kshan bandigrih ke daravaaje swayan khul gaye
 The guarded demons guarding the gate all became unconscious
 devaki ne usee kshan apane pati vasudev se kaha- he swami! aap nidra kaa tyaag karen or mere is ashtum putr ko gokul main le jaaen, vahaan is putr ko nand gop kii dharmapatni yashoda ko de den
 At that time, Yamunaji was completely flooded, but when Vasudevji descended to cross the Yamunaji with the boy Krishna in the soup, the moment the touch of the feet of the child came, Yamunaji came back to her former form
 kisi prakaar vasudevaji gokul pahunche or nand ke grih main pravesh kar unhone apana putr tatkaal unhen de diya or uske badale main unki kanya le lee
 He immediately returned from there and reached the prison house of Kansa
 praatavkaal jab sabhi rakshas paharedaar nidra se jaage to kansa ne dwarpal se poocha ki ab devaki ke garbh se kya hua? is baat kaa pataa lagaakar mujhe bataao
 The gatekeepers, following the orders of Maharaj, went to the prison and saw that there was a girl in Devaki's lap
 jise dekhakar dwarapalon ne kansa ko suchit kiya, kintu kansa ko to us kanya se bhay hone laga
 So he himself went to the prison and he grabbed the girl from Devaki's lap and slammed her on a stone rock but the girl went from Vishnu's maya towards the sky and went into space and turned into electricity
 usne kansa se kaha ki he dusht! tuje maarane vaala gokul main nand ke grih main utpann ho chukaa he or usee se teri mrityu sunishchit he
 My name is Vaishnavi, i am born of Maya of Lord Vishnu, the doer of the world, after saying this she went towards heaven
 us akashwani ko sunakar kansa krodhit ho uthaa
 She sent the demonic demoness to Nandaji's house to slay Krishna, but when she began to breastfeed the demonic Krishna, Krishna pulled her life from her breast and died as she called the demonic krishna-krishna
 jab kansa ko putana kii mrityu kaa samachar praapt hua to usne krishna kaa vadh karne ke liye kramshah keshi naamak daitya ko ashv ke rup main uske pashchaat arishth naamak daitya ko bail ke rup main bheja, kintu ye donon bhi krishna ke haathon mrityu ko praapt hue
 After this Kansa sent a monster named Kalyakhya as a crow, but he was also killed by Krishna
 apane balavaan rakshason kii mrityu ke aghat se kansa atyadhik bhaybheet ho gaya
 He ordered the gatekeepers to present Nanda immediately to me
 dwarpal nand ko lekar jab upasthit hue tab kansa ne nandji se kaha ki yadi tumhen apane praanon ko bachaana he to parijaat ke pushp le lao
 If you cannot bring it, then your slaughter is certain
 kansa kii baton ko sunakar nand ne 'aisa hihoga' kaha or apane grih kii ore chale gaye
 On coming home, he narrated the entire account to his wife Yashoda, who was also listening to Shri Krishna
 ek din shrikrishna apane mitron ke saath yamuna nadi ke kinare gend khel rahe the or achaanak swayan ne hi gend ko yamuna main phenk diya
 The main purpose of throwing the ball in the Yamuna was to somehow bring Parijat flowers
 atah ve kadamb ke vriksh par chadhakar yamuna main kud pade
 Gopal, named Sridhar, told Yashoda about Krishna jumping into the Yamuna
 yah sunakar yashoda bhaagti hui yamuna nadi ke kinare aa pahaunchin or usne yamuna nadi kii prarthana karte hue kaha- he yamuna! yadi main balak ko dekhuungi to bhadrapada maas kii rohinee yukt ashtami kaa vrath avashya karuungi kyonki dayaa, daan, sajjan praani, brahman kul main janm, rohiniyukt ashtami, gangaajal, ekadshi, gaya shraadh or rohinee vrath ye sabhi durlabh hai
 Thousands of Ashwamedha Yajna, Sahasron Rajasuya Yajna, charity pilgrimage and the fruits that are obtained by doing fasting are all obtained by performing Krishna fast
 yah baat naarad rishi ne indra se kahi
 Indra said- o Narada, the best among the sages! After jumping into the Yamuna river, what did that Balrupa Krishna do to go to Hades? Also tell this complete account
 naarad ne kaha- he indra! pataal main us balak se nagaraj kii patni ne kaha ki tum yahan kya kar rahe ho, kahan se aae ho or yahan aane kaa kya prayojan he? Nagapatni said - o Krishna! Have you played a game in which you have lost all your money? yadi yah baat thik he to kankad, mukut or maniyon kaa haar lekar apane grih main chale jaao kyonki is samay mere swami shayan kar rahe hai
 If they get up, they will devour you
 nagpatni kii baaten sunakar krishna ne kaha- 'he kante! main kis prayojan se yahan aayaa hoon, vah vrittant main tumhen bataata hoon
 Understand that i have lost the forehead of Kaliyanag with Kansa in gaming and i have come here to take the same
 balak krishna kii is baat ko sunakar nagpatni atyant krodhit ho uthin or apane soe hue pati ko uthaate hue usne kaha- he swami! aapke ghar yah shatru aayaa he
 So, you violate it
 apni swamini kii baton ko sunakar kaaliyanag nindravastha se jaag padaa or balak krishna se yuddh karne laga
 In this war Krishna became unconscious, he remembered Garuda to remove the same idol
 samaran hote hi garud vahaan aa gaye
 Sri Krishna now climbed Garuda and started fighting with Kaliyanag and he defeated Kaliyanag in battle
 ab kalianag ne bhaleebhanti jaan liya tha ki main jinase yuddh kar rahaa hoon, ve bhagwaan vishnu ke avatar shrikrishna hi hai
 Hence, he prostrated at the feet of Krishna and presented many flowers originating from Parijat to Krishna by placing them in the crown
 jab krishna chalane ko hue tab kaaliyanag kii patni ne kaha he swami! main krishna ko nahin jaan pai
 o Janardan, protect me without mantra, without action, without devotion
 he prabhu! mere swami mujhe waapas de den
 Then Shri Krishna said- o Sarpini! i will leave your husband in front of the cons which is the strongest among the demons, otherwise you leave your house
 ab shrikrishna kaaliyanag ke fan par nrity karte hue yamuna ke upar aa gaye
 Subsequently, all three people became shaky due to Kalia's taunt
 ab krishna kansa kii mathura nagari ko chal die
 Seeing the lotus flowers there, he also went to the Kalia snake in the middle reservoir of Yamuna
 idhar kansa bhi vismit ho gaya tathaa krishna prasannchitt hokar gokul laut aae
 His mother Yashoda performed various types of festivities when he came to Gokul
 ab indra ne naradji se poocha- he mahamune! sansar ke praani balak shrikrishna ke aane par atyadhik aanandit hue
 After all, what character did Shri Krishna do? Please all of you please tell me
 naarad ne indra se kaha- man ko harne vaala mathura nagar yamuna nadi ke dakshin bhaag main sthit he
 There lived Chanur, the great brother of Kansa
 us chanur se shrikrishna ke mallayuddh kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 o Indra! krishna evam chanur kaa mallayuddh atyant ascharyajanak tha
 Krishna was more childish than Chanur
 bheri shankh or mrudang ke shabdon ke saath kansa or keshi is yuddh ko mathura kii jansabha ke madhya main dekh rahe the
 Shri Krishna trapped his feet in Chanur's neck and killed him
 chanur kii mrityu ke pashchaat unka mallayuddh keshi ke saath hua
 Finally Keshi was also killed by Krishna in the battle
 keshi ke mrityuparant mallayuddh dekh rahe sabhi praani shrikrishna kii jai-jayakaar karne lage
 The killing of Chanur and Keshi by the child Krishna was extremely heartbreaking for Kansa
 atah usne sainikon ko bulaakar unhen ajna di ki tum sabhi astr-shastron se susajjit hokar krishna se yuddh karo
 o Indra! At the same time Shri Krishna meditated on the Garuda, Balarama and Sudarshan Chakra, as a result of which Baldevji came with a Sudarshan Chakra, mounted on Garuda
 unhen aata dekh balak krishna ne sudarshan chakra ko unase lekar swayan garud kii peeth par baithkar na jane kitne hi rakshason or daityon kaa vadh kar diya, kitnon ke sharir ang-bhang kar die
 In this war, Shri Krishna and Baldev killed innumerable demons
 balraamji ne apane aayudh shastr hal se or krishna ne sudarshan chakra se magh maas kii shukla paksh kii saptami ko vishaal daityon ke samooh kaa sarvanaash kiya
 When in the end only the vicious Kansa survived, Krishna said - o wicked, unrighteous, vicious people, now i will fight this and kill you at this place of great war and will liberate this world from you
 yah kehete hue shrikrishna ne uske keshon ko pakad liya or kansa ko ghumaakar prithvi par patake diya, jisase vah mrityu ko praapt hua
 On the death of Kamsa, the Gods offered conch shells and flowers
 vahaan upasthit samudaay shrikrishna kii jai-jayakaar kar rahaa tha
 On the death of Kamsa, Nanda, Devaki, Vasudev, Yashoda and all the creatures of this world celebrated Harsh Parva
 is katha ko sunne ke pashchaat indra ne naradji se kaha- he rishi is krishna janmashtami kaa purna vidhaan bataaen evam iske karne se kya punya praapt hota he, iske karne kii kya vidhi he? Naradji said- o Indra! Krishnjanmashtami of Bhadrapada month should be observed on this fast
 us din brahmacharya aadi niyamon kaa paalan karte hue shrikrishna kaa sthaapan karnaa chahie
 First of all, install the idol of Shri Krishna on the golden urn, and worship the idol of Lord Krishna with sandalwood, incense, flowers, lotus, etc
 and offer it in a systematic manner
 guruchi, choti pital or saunth ko shrikrishna ke aage alag-alag rakhen
 After this, install the ten forms of Lord Vishnu with Devaki
 hari ke saannnidhya main bhagwaan vishnu ke das avtaron, gopika, yashoda, vasudev, nand, baldev, devaki, gaayon, vatsa, kaaliya, yamuna nadi, gopagan or gopaputron kaa pujan karen
 After this, at the end of the eighth year, you should also do udipa karma of this important fast
 yathashakti vidhaan dwaara shrikrishna kii swarna pratimaa banaaen
 After this, offer 'matsya Kurm' with this mantra
 acharya brahma tathaa aath rutvijon kaa vaidic reeti se varan karen
 Make the Brahmin happy by giving him Dakshina and food
 upwas kii purv raatri ko halkaa bhojan karen or brahmacharya kaa paalan karen
 On the day of fast, one should retire from bathing in the morning
 pashchaat surya, som, yama, kaal, sandhi, bhoot, pawan, dikpati, bhoomi, akaash, khechar, amar or brahmadi ko namaskara kar purv yaa uttar mukh baithen
 After this, take resolution with water, fruit, kush and smell mamakhilpapaprashamanpurvak sarvabhisht siddhyeshrikrishna janmashtami vratamahan karishye
 Now at midday, bathe with black sesame water and set a 'sutikagriha' for Devaki
 tatpashchaat bhagwaan shrikrishna kii murti yaa chitra sthapit karen
 In the idol, the child should be breastfeeding Lord Krishna and touch his feet or have such feelings
 iske baad vidhi-vidhaan se pujan karen
 In worship, Devaki, Vasudev, Baldev, Nanda, Yashoda and Lakshmi should specify their names respectively
 phir nimna mantra se pushpanjali arpan karen-'praname dev janani twaya jatastu vamanh
 Vasudevat and Krishno Namastubhyam Namo Namah
 suputrarghyan pradattan main gruhaneman namostu te
 ' ant main prasad vitaran kar bhajan-kirthan karte hue raatri jaagran karen
 a person who observes Janmashtami fast attains opulence and salvation
 aayu, kirti, yash, laabh, putr va pautra ko praapt kar isi janm main sabhi prakaar ke sukhon ko bhoga kar ant main moksh ko praapt karata he
 Those who listen to the story of Shri Krishna with devotion, all their sins are destroyed

 Jurisprudence is the principle and philosophy of law
 nyaayashastra ke vidwaan athwa kanoonee darshanik, vidhi kii pravriti, kanoonee tark, kanoonee pranaliyaan evam kanoonee sansthaanon kaa gahan gyaan paane kii ummid rakhte hai
 Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and the focus was first on the principles of natural law, civil law and the law of nations
 saadhaaran athwa saamaanya nyaayashastra ko prashnon ke prakaar ke dwaara un virgon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he athwa in prashnon ke sarvottam uttar kaise die jaayan is bare main nyaayashastra ke siddhanton athwa vichaardhaaraon ke skulon donon hi tareekon se pataa lagaakar jinaki charchaa vidwaan karnaa chaahate hai
 Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, discusses the problems broadly in two sections: in prashnon ke uttar saamaanya nyaay shaastra kii vichaardhaara ke chaar praathmik kendron se milte hai: Contemporary philosopher Ronald Dworkin's study of law is also notable for advocating constructivist theory of jurisprudence that can be particularly marked as a middle-ground between the principles of natural law and the objective principles of general jurisprudence
 english shabdaawalee latin shabd jurisprudenshia par aadhaarit he: juris zeus kaa sambandhkaarak he jiskaa arth he "kanoon" evam prudenshia kaa arth he "gyaan"
 yah shabd english main san 1628 main sarvapratham sakshyankit hua, thik aise samay main jabaki "prudensh " shabd kaa arth "gyaan athwa kisi maamle main praveen dimag" ab aprachlit ho gaya tha
 The word may have come through French jurisprudence, which is already attested

 Praetors Government judges subsumed in ancient Roman society, deciding whether a case is in accordance with the annual declaration of Addicts, prosecutable cases, or, under exceptional circumstances, the Additional Concept in the Annual Charter, establishing an executive body of law Used to do tatpashchaat ek ayudex maamle ke tathyon ke anusaar nidaan kar nirnay karata tha
 It was expected that their sentences should be simple interpretations of traditional practices, but in effect it was an activity that, in broad legal form, was traditionally followed by a traditional way of reconsidering each case and soon new On the basis of social parables, it was transformed in a harmoniously favorable manner to become an equitable interpretation

 The doctrine of natural law holds with the claim that there are some laws which are inherent in nature to which the enacted laws should be as consistent as possible
 This view was repeatedly summarized by the adage that an unjust law is not a right law
 In Latin, lex inista non est lex, in which injustice is defined as contrary to natural law
 prakritik kanoon naitikta ke saath kaaphi kareeb se juda hua he evam aitihaasik prabhaavshaalee sanskarnon main, ishwariya abhipraay bhi saath hai
 In order to simplify its concepts, the doctrine of natural law seeks to guide the law-making power of the state and to determine a moral compass to promote "welfare"
 vastunishth naitikta ke niyam ke vichaar maanviya kanoonee vyavastha main jo bahari he, usee mul main prakritik kanoon kii jaden hai
 What is right or what is wrong can vary according to the center of one's own interest
 prakritik kanoon kii pahchaan kabhi-kabhi is kahawat se kii ja sakati he ki "ek anyaaypurv kanoon koi kanoon ho hi nahin saktaa", lekin jaisaa ki prakritik kanoon aadhunik adhivaktaaon main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn maane jane vaale, jon finnish ne yah tark pesh kiya he ki yah kahawat shastreey thomist sthiti ke liye maamuli maardarshak he
 Aristotle is often called the father of natural law
 uske darshanik purvajon, sucraat or platon kii hi tarah arestu ne bhi prakritik nyaay yaa prakritik adhikaar arestu ne nicomechian aachaar samhita par apni pustak ke paanchaven khand sweekaar kiya he
 Aristotle's theory of justice is bound up with the golden middle view
 sachmuch jise ve "raajnneetik nyaay" kehete hai avagunon ke vipareet bich kaa madhyam ke rup main naitik gun par unki charchaa se vyutpann he, jaisaa ki har duusare gun kii vyavastha unhone kii he
 The long debate about his own doctrine on justice is rooted in Nicomacian ethics and it begins with the question of what is the mean of just actions
 ve tark dete hai ki "nyaay" kii shabdaawalee vastav main do bhinn kintu ek duusare se sambandhit vichaaron, saamaanya nyaay or vishesh nyaay se sandarbhit hai
 When a person's actions are all-encompassing in all matters related to others, Aristotle accepts his justice in the sense of general justice, just as the notion of justice is more or less coherent with virtue
 "vishesh" yaa "vishesh nyaay", ek duusare ke virodhamas main, saamaanya nyaay athwa vyaktigat gun kaa hi ek ang he jo duusare ke saath samaan rup se vyavhaar karne se sambandhit hai
 Aristotle is further infected by this unauthorized discussion of justice in the relative view of political justice, which implies his being somewhat closer to the subject of modern jurisprudence
 raajnneetik nyaay ke bare main, arestu tark dete hai ki yah aanshik rup se parampara kaa maamla he
 This can be taken as a statement that resembles the principles of modern natural law
 kintu ise bhi avashya hi yaad kiya janaa chahie ki arestu naitikta ke drushtikon par apane vichaar vyakt kar rahe hai, na ki kanoon kii pranali par or isiilie yahaan prakruti par unki tippaniyan kanoon ke rup main adhiniyamit naitikta kii praarambhik shiksha ke bare main hai na ki swatah kanoon ke bare main
 is prashn ke uttar main yah anuchhed maun he
 The best evidence that Aristotle's concern for natural law is derived from the scriptures where Aristotle mentions that, in addition to the "special" laws that everyone has set for themselves, is also a "common" law that Is according to nature
 haalanki is tippanee ke sandarbh se yah pataa chalata he ki arestu ne keval itani hi salaah di ki sahitya shastreey drushtikon se aise kanoon ke prati aagrah suvidhajanak to ho saktaa he, khaskar jab kisi ek ke nagar kaa "vishesh" kanoon jab maamle ke pratikul bana diya gaya, aisa nahin ki vastav main is prakaar kaa koi kanoon tha bhi
 iske alaava, arestu ne teen main se do ummidavaaron ke liye saarvbhaumik rup se vaid, prakritik kanoon ke paraamarsh ko is anuchhed main galat tehraaya
 iske falswaroop arestu kii prakritik kanoon kii parampara kii paitrukataa vivadasd ho gai he
 Sharia is called the collection of Islamic law
 is shabdaawalee kaa matlab he "paddati" yaa "rasta", yah kanoonee dhaancha he jiske tahat jindagi ke adhiktar nijee masalon ko unke liye jo nyaay ke islamic usulon kii bina par kanoonee taur-tareeke se jite hai
 Fiqh is the terminology for Islamic jurisprudence, which is made up of the judgments of Islamic jurists
 islamic adhyayan kaa bunivaadee ghatak, fichh us paddati ko vistaar se batalaata he jiske jariye se islamic kanoon ko praathmik or madhyamik sroton se baahar nikaala gaya he
 The mainstream of Islam identifies Fiqh, which means to know and explain in detail the principles cited by scholars from Sharia
 vidwaanon ko yah ummid he ki phikah or sharia kisi bhi masale main aman ke paigaam ho sakate hai, lekin ise sunishchit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In the Islamic philosophy, the initial structure of reasoning was applied in Islamic jurisprudence from the 7th century onwards through the process of Qiyas
 islam ke sunahare yug ke dauraan islam ke darshanikon evam nyayavidon ke bich is vishay par taarkik bahes hua karti thi ki kya kiyas saadrush sahdharmee tark-vitark kaa prerak bahes kaa vishay he athwa nirpeksh nyaay vaakya he
 Some Islamic scholars have argued that Qiyas refers to the deliberation of the argument, which Ibn Hajm has not considered to present the argument, that Qiyas is not concerned with absolute debate, but absolute justice, but absolute justice
 Is considered to be a very coherent argument in the true and figurative sense
 duusari ore, al gajali ne yah daleel pesh kii ki kiyas sahi myne main saadrush sahgharmi daleel se matlab rakhata he evam lakshanik myne main nirpeksh nyaay vaakya se
 us vakt ke duusare islamic vidwaanon ne yah daleel pesh kii ki kiyas shabd sahi myne main saadrush sahgharmi daleel ke saath hi nirpeksh nyaay-vaakya matlab rakhata he
 St
 Thomas Akinas, better known as "doctor Angelicus, Doctor Univarsalis", was a philosopher and theologian in the classical Orthodox tradition
 ve prakritik dharamshastra ke shastreey prastaavkon main agrani hai evam roman catholic carch ke praathmik darshanik drushtikon kii lambe arase tak pahal ke liye darshan-shaastra kii thomsvaadi chintaadhara ke skool ke pita maane jate hai
 The work for which he is best known is Summa Theologica
 He is considered by many Catholics as the greatest of the Church's thirty-three doctors
 falswaroop kai shikshan sansthaanon ne shiksha kaa namakaran bhi unheen ke naam par kiya he
 Akinas mentions four types of legislation
 ye hai, shaashvat, prakritik, maanviya, evam divya kanoon
 shashavat kanoon ishwar kaa vidhaan he jo sampoorn sristi par shashan karata he
 Natural law is a human "participation" in perpetual law legislation, which is explored by logic
 prakritik kanoon, nihsandeh, "pratham siddhanton" par aadhaarit hai: Akinas has described the desire to live and breed with all the basic human values on which all human values are based

 Hobbes was a contractualist and believed that the law gained the untold consent of the people
 He believed that from the state of nature, the structure of society was created to provide protection to the people from the state of war, which exists otherwise among mankind
 Without a hierarchical society, life is lonely, oppressed, disgusting, bestial and ephemeral "
 It is generally remarked that Hobbes's view of the invention of human nature was influenced by his own time, the English Civil War and the Cromwelli dictatorship
 Events took place and he realized that autocratic dominion in the hands of the emperor is the cornerstone of a civilized society whose subjects Meets Anun

 There was disagreement between Fuller, who was a natural advocate and Hart, who was a positivist, about whether the Nazi law was so bad that it was not later considered a law

 The identification of a specific theorist as a positivist or as a theoretical of natural law sometimes includes effects and degrees, and special effects on the function of the theorist
 In particular, older natural advocates, such as Akinas and John Locke, have made no distinction in analytical and normative jurisprudence
 kintu aadhunik prakritik adhivaktaaon ne, jaise ki, jon finnish ne pratyakshvaadi hone kaa daawa kiya he, jabaki abhi bhi unki daleel he ki kanoon multah naitik praani he

 In this way, Kelsen concurs with the claim that the compulsion of legitimate standards is due to his distinctive 'legitimate' character without any superhuman source such as the discovery of God without the humanized nature — or what was most important in his time— a humanized state or nation can be understood

 a school with such an ideology was once called an exclusive legal positivism and is associated with the view that the legal validity of a standard can never depend on its moral purity
 Another school of this ideology takes the level of inclusive legal positivism, whose main proponent is Will Valuchau, and is tied to the idea that ethical considerations can determine the legal validity of a norm, but not necessarily the same

 In his book Lodge Empire, Dworkin attacked Hart and positivists in protest against not accepting the law as a moral issue
 dorkin tark dete hai ki kanoon ek 'vyaakhyaatmak' avadharana he, jajon ke liye yah jaruri ban jaataa he ki iskaa yathochit behatar prayog kii talash karen or kanoonee vivaad kaa sabase sahi nyaaypurvak hal dhundh nikaalen, jo unhen sanvaidhanik paramparaon ne diya he
 According to him, the law is not entirely based on social facts, but in it for the institutional facts and practices which we readily accept as legal, they are morally justified as a justification

 According to Dworkin's law as a principle of integrity, economy has two dimensions

 lekin un vyakhyaaon ke bare main jo khari utarati hai, dorkin kaa maananaa he ki sahi vyakhya vahi he jo samudaay ko raajnneetik karypranaliyaan unki behatari pradaan karne ke liye athwa unhen adhik se adhik sarvotkrisht banane ke liye kii jaati he
 But many authors are skeptical that the complex practices given for a given community are only one of the best justifications, and others have suspected that, even if this is the case, they must be part of the law of that community
 Should be calculated as kanoonee yatharthwaad kuch scandinavian or america lekhakon ke lokapriy drushtikon hai
 Skeptics in tone, it believes that the law should be understood and determined by the actual functioning of the courts, offices of law, police stations, not the rules and doctrinal opinions set out in the statutes or contained in scholarly theses

 The essential element of legal realism is that all law is created by human beings and thus it is subject to human moral morality, imperfection and imperfection

 What is the purpose or goal of law? Which moral or political principles provide the foundation of law? What is the proper function of law? For which acts should the sentence be held, and what kind of punishment should be allowed? What is justice What rights do we have? Is there any duty to comply with the law? What is the cost of rule by law? There are some schools with different ideologies and their following concerns: sadachaar ke siddhant jis tarah samakaleen naitikta ke achaarshastra main charitra main naitikta kii bhoomika par vishesh bal dete hai

 From a historical point of view, this effort deals primarily with Aristotle or later Thomas Akinas

 Ethics is "the principle of duty or moral obligation"
 The philosopher Immanuel Kant has formulated an influential theory of ethics of law

 John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Bentham and was the torch bearer of utilitarian philosophy until the end of the nineteenth century

 However, when the voltage reaches the ionization potential of the gas, ionization occurs by encounter

 The flow of the filler current can be prevented by reducing only the filtered voltage to the ionization potential

 aitihaasik upanyaas upanyaas sahitya kii vah vidha he jisamen kisi bhi kalkhand vishesh kii prakhyat katha kaa chithran ho
 As such, the depiction of any particular period can be a historical novel
 rangabhumi, boond or samudr, jhootha sach or uttarkatha bhi apane yug kaa pramanik chithran karne ke kaaran, aitihaasik upanyaas ho sakate hai; kintu aitihaasik upanyaas hone ke liye ek anivaary shart he - uski katha kaa prakhyat hona, pathakon kaa usase purv-parichit hona
 On the other hand, we also consider our ancient stories as our ancient history; But a section of scholars wants to consider it as 'myth' or 'false' according to foreign principles
 at: vah use apana itihaas nahin maanata
 As a result, mythological novels have become a separate category from historical novels
 puraakathaon ko apana itihaas maanate hue bhi main chaahoonga ki puranic upanyaason kaa varg aitihaasik upanyaason se pruthak hi rahe
 reason ? puranic upanyaas keval ek kaal vishesh kii ghatnaayen hi nahin hai, unki apni ek mulya-vyavastha he
 They are presenting the values of the Upanishads as a novel through characters
 jo upanyaas puranic kaal, ghatnaon or charitron par aadhrut to hai, kintu us mulya-vyavastha kaa anumodan nahin karte, unhen puranic upanyaas kahana uchit nahin he
 Most of them are written only to demolish them by people unfamiliar with the mythical value system or their opponents
 premchandpurv or premchand kii aitihaasik or jeevaniparak kathaayen samaaj ko apana gaurav or shaury samaran karaane main safal hui thim
 But his life did not last long
 premchand rachit 'harisingh nalava' aaj kitne logon ko samaran he ? unka bas aitihaasik mahatv hi rah gaya he
 According to Vrindavanlal Varma's own statements, there are some general and some special reasons for writing his historical novel
 unhone sweekaar kiya he ki sar walter scot ke angarezi upanyaas pard kar unke man main yah baat ai thi ki ve bharat ke sammaan kii pratishtha ke liye bharat ke itihaas ke gauravpurn prishthon ko lekar vaise hi upanyaas likhenge
 He discusses an incident giving this general reason as well as a specific reason
 bundelkhand main based ek punjabi parivaar ke yahan ek vivaah ke avasar par verma ji bhi aamantrit the
 Many relatives and acquaintances of that Punjabi family were also present there
 un logon ke madhya hone vaala vaartalap verma ji ne bhi suna, jisamen ve log bundelkhand kii nirdhantaa, pichhadepan tathaa ashiksha ke vishay main apmanjanak dhang se charchaa kar rahe the; or is kshetra tathaa vahaan ke nivaasiyon ke prati apni ghrinaa vyakt kar rahe the
 Varma ji has admitted that he found all this extremely humiliating and resolved at the same time that he would write a novel to honor the pride of Bundelkhand
 unhone apni kshamtanusaar apane abhipsit kaal ke itihaas kii chaanbin kii, apane kathy ke liye pramaan jutaaye; or thode bahut aitihaasik romance kii sristi bhi kii
 Although their area is limited to Bundelkhand only; But we know that a writer who loves his earth also loves his culture
 vastut: itihaas or bhugol hi to samskruti kaa nirmaan karte hai
 She also wrote historical romances like 'virata's Padmini' and 'garh Kundar' and a history-cumbersome novel like 'jhansi Ki Rani'; But balanced novels like 'mrignayani' also came up
 unka drushtikon atyant spasht he
 The writer is not free from his time
 vrundavanlalaal verma ke paas apana kathy he
 They are waging a war with their writing
 unka lekhan ek sangharsh he
 They are trying to present the best of the country; And are also boosting the morale of our society
 acharya chaturasen shastri ke bhi apane lekhan ke sambandh main kuch aise hi vaktavy mil jate hai
 In the subject of 'somnath', he has written that by reading Kanhaiyalal Maniklal Munshi's novel 'jai Somnath', he would have aspirations in his mind to strike his hand in the mouth of Munshi; And he composed his novel 'somnath'
 'vayangraksham:' kii bhoomika main unhone sweekaar kiya he ki unhone kuch naveen tathyon kii khoj kii he, jinhen ve pathak ke munh par maar rahe hai
 As a result, 'somnath' has become more and more romantic and romantic novel in a fiery attempt to shake the canal; And in a hurry to display his knowledge and put his discovered facts before the readers, completely ignoring the requirements of the novel mode, he kept filling the pages with unnecessary and redundant details in 'vayanaraksham:' and 'sona and Khoon' Huh
 kisi vishisht kathy athwa pratipaadya ke abhaav ne unki is pralaap main vishesh sahaayta kii he
 These are not such goals, which can give literary importance to any work or they can make a long-term place for themselves in the memory of the nation and society
 'sona or koon' likhte hue chaturasen shastri, kadachit itihaas kii rau main aise bah gaye ki bhul hi gaye ki ve upanyaas likh rahe hai, at: saikadon prishth itihaas hi likhte chale gaye
 This leads to the loss of a novel element; Because the novel is not just history
 'vaishali kii nagarvadhoo' tathaa anya anek aitihaasik upanyaas likhane kaa lakshya ek vishesh prakaar ke parivesh kaa nirmaan karnaa bhi ho saktaa he; kintu isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki anek log 'vaishali kii nagarvadhoo' main stri kii baadhyataa or pidaa dekhte hai
 However, that era of history was a period in which the litterateur sees many attractions
 mahatma buddha, amrapali, singh senapati tathaa ajatshatru ke aasapaas hindi sahitya kii anek mahatvapurn kritiyon ne janm liya he
 It shows the helplessness of women, or discusses the formation and form of republics, the story of Vatsalya, or the analogy of Marxist philosophy - the fact is that the surroundings were exceptionally romantic in many respects
 rangey raghav ke aitihaasik upanyaason kii bhi ek lambii suchi he
 Even he has written long novels at that period, whose authentic history is not available
 at: use pragaitihaasik kaal kaha jaataa he
 In 'murdon ka Tila' he has presented a fictional picture of that era and by his own estimation has given the reason for the extinction of a culture
 kintu jis samskruti kaa vistaar aaj haryana hi nahin gujarat tak pramanit ho rahaa ho, uskaa ek jalplavan main samaapt ho janaa, bahut sahamat nahin karata
 Drowning is a town, the city drowns
 kabhi-kabhi bukamp se pompeyi jaisaa nagar dhwast ho jaataa he
 Thus, an entire culture does not end up in a floodplain
 yaa phir vah koi khand-pralay hi tha
 But where this discussion is concerned, there has been evidence of water extinction, not of flooding
 phir bhi lekhak kii aitihaasik kalpana kii udaan kaa anand to vaise upanyaas dete hi hai
 All the novels by Hazariprasad Dwivedi fall under the category of historical-mythological novels
 unka parivesh chithran adbhut he
 They are authentic as well as attractive
 kintu 'banbhatta kii aatmakatha' kii nayika bhattini aitihaasik charitra nahin he; or upanyaas kii anek ghatnaayen hi nahin, uskaa pratipaadya bhi bhattini par hi nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, that novel becomes historical romance rather than historical; But from a novel point of view, it is a rare work
 'charuchandralekh' tathaa 'punarnava' pracheen saahitiyik kritiyon tathaa prakhyat lokthaon par aadhrut kritiyaan hai
 'anamdas ka Potha' has been written by making the character of the Upanishads, Raikw Muni, the central character
 at: uski ginati puranic upanyaason main hi hoti he; kintu spashtat: lekhak ke paas apana pratipaadya he
 He is linking the problems of his time with the universal and ever-present problems and searching for their eternal solution
 amritlal nagar ne anek yugon se sambandhit anek aitihaasik upanyaas likhe hai or un sab kaa apana apana mahatv he
 But his three novels 'ekada Nemisharanya', 'manas ka Hans' and 'khanjan Nayan' seek some clarification
 'ekda nemisharany' ke kendra main mahabharat-lekhan kaa vishay he
 That novel is not related to Mahabharata Katha, hence it is not a mythological novel
 uski samasya keval itani he ki mahabharat kii vartmaan prati, kis kaal main or kin logon ke dwaara prastut kii gai
 That period is completely historical
 paatr chaahe kaalpanik hi hon
 The protagonist of the novel is 'rewriting of Mahabharata'
 'maanas kaa hans' or 'khanjan nayan' hindi ke do mahaan kaviyon ko nayak bana kar likhe gaye upanyaas hai
 Although there is no denying the importance of 'khanjan Nayan' to me; But there is no doubt that due to any of his complications he was neither discussed nor popularized like 'manas ka Hans'
 'maanas kaa hans'anek roopon main vilakshan upanyaas he
 This is a historical novel from the time of Nayak Goswami Tulsidas and in terms of his life, contemplation, meditation, penance, goals and achievement, he does not seem to be any different from any mythological novel
 uskaa nayak puraana purush he
 


 But the Puran Purush should be far away and different from an ordinary man of today, whereas Tulsi is such an existence, which we remember daily and find ourselves very near
 unase tadatmya kar sakate hai
 He is neither born in Indravati's Amravati, nor in any sage ashram
 ek abhaagaa balak he tulsi, jo us samay janm letaa he, jab desh or gram par sankat aayaa hua he
 The war is going on
 satta kaa hastantaran ho rahaa he
 The mother dies and the father abandons her as unfortunate
 ant: or bahya saakshyon par chitrit kiya gaya unka bachapan bataata he ki jo koi use sahaara dene kaa praytn karata he, vah sansar ke manch se hat jaataa he
 There is nothing supernatural in it, yet Godly Leela is entered
 jiskaa koi na ho, uskaa ishwar hota he
 Tulsi is also God
 vastut: yah bhi puraanon main ai bhakton kii katha jaisi hi ghatana he ki vyakti kaa ahan purnat: vigalit ho jaataa he or vah ishwar ke sammukh purna aatmasamarpan kar detaa he, to ishwar uskaa haath pakad lete hai
 Tulsi till the teenagers see how much violence there is in the world and how much selfishness there is
 bhukh he, nangai he
 The body of man and woman is sold in the market for food
 satta atyaachaari he, dhan karunaheen he, dharm ke kendra bhoga main duube hai
 Jealousy indulges in malice
 prayek bhakt ke samaan tulsi bhi apane ishwar se poochhate hai ki yadi yah sristi uski he, to yah sansar itnaa naarkeey kyon he ? Adolescence is feminine; But Tulsi does not dare to seek his love through unrighteousness
 yuvavastha main daanpaty he or daanpaty kaa sangharsh
 Opposition of female man
 maayqe or sasuraal kaa paksh
 Psychology of daughter, wife and woman
 


 or phir vairaygy kaa aarambh
 In the end, Palmer will not leave you, but you are not fresh
 


 yahan se tulsi ek saamaanya purush se kuch upar uthte dikhte hai
 This is not unnatural
 samvedansheel man, vairaygy kaa bhav or patni kii kathorta
 There are only two options: either they would become slaves to Kamini, or they would be freed from work
 satvaheen hote to jivan bhar ko kamini ke das ho kar reriate
 But how would Ram's slave become a slave of work? tulsi ke madhyam se ek kavi ke nirmaan kaa chithran bahut hi pramanik rup se hua he
 The initiator's mind becomes with them in such a way as to become aware of and understand the creation process
 jyotishiyon or lekhakon kii pratispardhaayen
 The conspiracy of scholars against each other
 dhan or yash ke liye maaramaari
 Without jealousy, literature may not have existed in any era
 sadhana ke maarg main baadhaayen hai, pralobhan hai
 They also come in the form of women and also in the form of wealth
 kisi bhi kshetra kaa koi bhi sadhak jaanata he ki vah aage badhata he, to use rokane ke liye vighn baadhaon ke rup main choti moti uplabdhiyaan hi aati hai
 If he gets entangled in them, he does not proceed
 unhen thukraa detaa he to badi uplabdhiyon tak ja pahunchataa he
 Tulsi becomes free from their personal relationships to the society as a whole
 at: samaaj kii pidaa ko dekhte or samajhate hai
 That is why they call social service as Rama's work
 bhukhe pyaase hatyare ko jal or bhojan dete hai
 And in the name of caste, he says: Say Dhoot, say Avdhoot, say Rajput, say Jolha
 kahu kii beti son betaa na byaahab, kahu kii jati bigaari na soi?
 Here the relation of world and quietness is clear
 sansar or brahm kaa samanvay hota he
 The relation of ascetics and society is revealed
 acharya hajariprasad dvivedi kii 'anamadas kaa potha' main ai anek uktiyaan yahan samaran ho aati hai
 They say that austerity does not happen in the forest, but in the society
 tulsi ko bhi samaaj kii pidaa vyapti he
 They are engaged in the service of society
 kamini or kanchan kaa tyaag hi pragati kaa maarg he
 One cannot be liberated without abandoning the desire for wealth and fame
 tabhi to tulsi kehete hai ki dhan kii trishna se bhi buree he yash kii lipsaa
 And finally Rahim turns down the manslaughter of Akbar's court proposed by Khankhana
 aadhyatm kaa vah siddhant ki dukhi kii seva ke samaan doosraa punya nahin he or 'par pidaa sam nahin adhamai'
 It has also been called by Vyas and Tulsi has also recognized it
 yaheen se spasht hota he ki sanyas or vairaygy kaa swaroop kya he
 Rising above selfishness, renouncing attachment, freeing from body relationships, love the whole creation of God; And considering him as Shiva, his service is disinterest
 ishwar nirbharta hi sanyas he
 This ultimately leads to the seeker finding God
 vastut: apane itihaas ke ujjwal rup kii puja, apni samskruti kii hi puja he
 Tulsi presented the essence of the overall Indian culture in Ramcharitmanas
 or tulsi ko katha nayak bana kar amritlal nagar ne videshi akraman kii krurta or or videshi shashan kii kathorta ke madhya bhi apni samskruti ko apane jivan main utaarne or uski raksha ke liye sangharsh ko jeevant kar diya he
 The first volume 'nirman' of Narendra Kohli's famous novel 'todo Kara Todo' in relation to Swami Vivekananda was published in 1992 AD, the second 'sadhana' in 1993 AD, the third 'parivrajak' in 2003 AD and the fourth 'directive' 'in 2004 AD
 to 'todo kaara todo' aitihaasik upanyaas ban jaataa he
 The gap between history and our own era is almost over
 uske nayak kaa raajnneeti se koi sambandh nahin he
 He is the Nayaka Purana Purush; But the dense population of Calcutta city is born, raised and raised
 usne kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main adhyayan kiya he
 He is born as a prince and becomes poor because of his father's friends
 bhukhe pet, fate or maile kapadon main nange paanv chalate hue chakkar kha kar gir padataa he
 In such a situation, he has a divine feeling
 aadhyatm is yatharth sansar main aisa pravesh karata he ki us sudarshan purush kaa, jise dekh kar amareeki yuvatiyaan pagal ho gai thim, vivaah nahin ho paata
 He cannot find an ordinary wife
 jiske vishay main dow henry jon rhite ne likhaa tha ki uski vidwata, america ke saare vidvan prophessoron kii samuhik vidwata se bhi adhik thi, use kalakatta nagar main sau rupye kii ek naukari nahin milti
 He himself admits that he was not born so that he would produce children by marriage and nurture them by clergy or mastery
 vah ek lakshya lekar sansar main aayaa tha
 His master called him 'mother's work'
 bharat bhar main gum kar usne bharat mata kii santanon kaa ksht dekha tha
 Therefore, wandering in various princely states, he was asked to combine the knowledge of the new age without abandoning the ancient knowledge
 khetadi naresh raja ajitsingh ke prasaad ke upar bhautikee kii prayogshaala khulavaa di thi
 Gaekwad of Vadodara was asked to give technical education to his children and open an engineering college
 america main kaha tha, ham tumhen dharm denge, tum ham ko udyog dhandhe do
 a monk was making an education policy for this country, so that poverty and ignorance could be removed from the country
 aadhyatm sansar ke bahut nikat aa gaya tha
 In Samadhi at Kanya Kumari, Swami Vivekananda saw two paths for himself - darshan of Jagadamba, happiness of samadhi and salvation for himself
 doosraa tha bharat mata kii nirdhan or peedit santan kii seva
 For him, there was no difference between Bharatmata and Jagadamba
 vah sanyasi videshiyon dwaara bharat mata ke mukh par potee gai kalimaa ko dhone ke liye america gaya tha or gaya tha ki vahaan se swayan dhan kama kar laae or is desh ke asahaay daridron kii sahaayta kare; kyonki vah jaan gaya tha ki is desh ke dhani swaarthee or aatmakendrit hai tathaa nirdhan asamarth hai
 This historical novel reiterates the declaration of Ishavasopanishad that no country or society can be happy by merely neglecting spirituality and worshiping the world; Nor can any country adopt happiness only and ignore the world completely and develop itself and earn happiness for itself
 swami vivekananda ne parivrajak ke rup main bharat kaa bhraman karte hue, alvar main apane shishyon se kaha tha ki aaj tak bharat kaa itihaas videshiyon ne hi likhaa he
 The history of India is disorganized
 usamen kalkram parishuddh or yatharth nahin he
 History written by Englishmen and other foreigners is only to break our morale
 vah hamen durbal hi banayega
 They only tell us our faults
 jo videshi, hamaare taur-tareeqe, reeti-rivaaj, hamaare dharm or darshan ko bahut kam samajhate hai, ve hamaara vaastavik or purvaagraharahit itihaas kaise likh sakate hai ? isiilie usamen anek bhrantiyaan ghar kar gai hai
 Now it is for us to find our own independent path
 apane pracheen granthon kaa adhyayan karen, shodh karen; or parishuddh, yatharth, sahanubhutipurna tathaa aatma ko uddipt kar dene vaala itihaas likhen
 The significance of a historical novel is not only in the beautiful and attractive depiction of that country and period
 vah apane yug ko aseem or nirbaadh kaal ke saath jodta he or uskaa apana ek nischit pratipaadya bhi hota he
 In his absence, no work can achieve importance
 yashpal kii 'divya' ek siddhant ke pratipaadan ke liye likhi gai
 But it does not have history, only historical surroundings
 vahaan itihaas kaa kalatmak abhas maatr he, jaise bhagwaticharan verma kii 'chitralekha' he
 They are not historical novels
 vahaan apni baat kehane ke liye itihaas kaa kalatmak bhram maatr utpann kiya gaya he
 Biography is a purely historical work; But it is not a novel
 rangey raghav ne upanyaas ke bahut nikat rahete hue, anek paatro kii aitihaasik jivaniyaan likhi hai
 What is the difference between a biographical and historical novel? If more biographies are available, can the novel give more than that? aitihaasik upanyaas jeevani se bahut adhik de saktaa he
 If this was not the case, why would the reader get more satisfaction from the novel even after reading the biographies of Swami Vivekananda and his speeches etc
? The novel is no more historical than a biography
 nahin ho saktaa
 Why are readers still in demand for the novel? udaahranarth, swami vivekanand koi pramanik jeevani nahin bataati ki pita ke dehanth ke pashchaat unka parivaar aksmaat hi itnaa nirdhan kyon ho gaya tha
 The biography states that they were sisters but after the father's death one does not know where she went
 jeevanikar swami ji kii jeevani likh rahaa he, at: unki bahanon ke vivaah kii charchaa kyon karegaa ? swami ji ko almoda main apni kis bahan kii aatmahatya kaa samachar mila tha ? ye tathaa is prakaar ke saikadon prashn jivaniyon main anuttarit hi rah jate hai
 The biographer states that Swamiji discussed Vedanta with Ajitsingh
 harvilas sharada or shyamakrishna verma se gambhir charchaayen kin
 But he does not say what those discussions were
 vah yah nahin bataata ki unke saath chicago tak jane vaale lallu bhai koun the or ve boston ke pashchaat kahan vilupt ho gaye
 Overall, the author is present at all places in the biography and is only giving information
 vah bhi chaan chaan kar
 The novelist makes all that environment come alive
 vah ishwar ke samaan saare paatro ke man main samaa jaataa he
 It is all pervasive, but not visible anywhere
 vah parakaaya pravesh karata he
 Does not look at his characters remotely, identifies with them
 vahi ho jaataa he
 Even in terms of language, all these novels are very capable and strong
 hajariprasad dvivedi ke shabd to apana arth swayan udghaatit karte chalate hai
 They continue to ponder the words even after narrating the story
 or nagar ji charitron ke anusaar boli ko jis prakaar prastut karte hai - vah adbhut he
 The difference between the Awadhi of the villager, the Awadhi of the Nagar, the Awadhi of the illiterate and the Awadhi of the illiterate, the Awadhi of the Hindu and the Awadhi of the Muslim, automatically begin to draw attention to themselves
 in upanyaason kii sabase badi uplabdhi yah he ki in main itihaas aajke pathak ko swayan se asamprukt athwa bahut dur nahin lagata
 Ihloch and spirituality are no longer two opposing concepts
 aaranyak jivan or naagarik jivan ek duusare se aparichit nahin rah jate
 Our historical novel has come a long way and is reaching some conclusions which are not just principles for our society
 vah unka dainandin jivan he
 He is giving them a holistic biography, which cannot be given only by socio-worldly novels that describe idolatry
 haan ! pathak se vah thodi satvik buddhi kii apeksha bhi karata he
 Swami Vivekananda had said that this country does not need to get into the morass of politics even for its independence
 yadi ham apana satvik charitra praapt kar lenge to hamaari samasyaon kaa samaadhaan apane aap hi ho jayega
 Here is a list of famous Roma people

 The Nand Dynasty was the most powerful and great justice or barber dynasty of ancient India
 jisane paanchavin-chauthi shatabdi isa purv uttari bharat ke vishaal bhaag par shashan kiya
 Nandavansha was founded by the first Chakravarti Emperor Mahapadmananda
 bhartiya itihaas main pehali baar ek aise samrajya kii sthapana hui jisaki simaaen ganga ke maidaanon ko long gai
 This empire was not actually a loose union of independent states or feudal lords but rather a powerful king force
 ye ek ekaraat kii chhatrachhaaya main ek akhand rajtantr tha, jiske paas apaar sanybal, dhanabal or janabal tha
 Chakravarti emperor Mahapadmananda conquered all the nearby dynasties and established a vast empire and implemented the system of central governance
 isiilie samraat mahapadam nand kokendriya shashan paddati kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 It is worth remembering what the kings of Nandavans donated to their heirs and future generations
 In Smith's words, "he forced 66 conflicting states not to overthrow each other and entrust themselves to a higher regulatory authority
" " ni:andeh nando ke utthan ko bhartiya raajnneeti ke utkarsh kaa pratik mana ja saktaa he
 This was confirmed in "mahananda" from the early three shlokas of the epic "krishna Charitra" composed by Emperor Samudragupta
 magar ukt mahakavy kaa vivaran maatr hi shesh he
 Samudra Vasana Shebhya: Hai Aas Mudampi Shriya:
 upaay hastera krishya:tat:shodkrut nandsaat
 
 itihaas kii jaankaree ke anek vivaran puraanon, jain or buddha granthon evam unani itihaaskaaron ke varnan main praapt hote hai
 However, it can be said with certainty that Nanda was a dynasty of Kshatriyas whose most of the nature was of Indian governance tradition
 curtius kahata he ki sikandar ke samay vartmaan kshatriya nand shaashak kaa pita vastav main ek garib nai kaa betaa tha, unani lekhakon ke varnanon se gyaat hota he ki vah "vartmaan raja" agramas athwa jandrama tha, jisaki pahchaan dhananand se kii gai he
 His father was Mahapadmananda, which seems to be the Kshatriya varna from the appropriate statement of Curtius
 kuch puraana granth or jain granth "parishisht parvan main bhi use naapit kaa putr kaha gaya he
 Only one thing is clear from these many references that the king of Nandavans was of the justice justice Kshatriya varna
 nandavansh kaa pratham or sarvaprasiddh raja hua
 The Puranas count it only in the Shaishunag dynasty, but in the Buddhist and Jain Anushrutis it is considered the initiator of a new dynasty, which is correct
 use jain granthon main ugrasen or puraanon main mahapadmapati bhi kaha gaya he
 In the Kaliyugarajavrittantavale portions of the Puranas, it is given the nouns of Atibali, Mahakshatrantaka and and Parasurama
 spasht he, bahut badi senawale us raaj ne apane samakalik anek kshatriya rajwanshon kaa uchchhed kar apane bal kaa pradarshan kiya
 It is not surprising that with that immense wealth and military power, he undertook to conquer all the regions between the Himalayas and the Narmada
 uske jite hue pradeshen main akshvaku, paanchal, kauravy, kaashi, haihay, ashmak, vitihotra, kaling, shurasen, mithila, tathaa anya anek rajya shaamil the
 Nowhere between the Himalayas and Vindhyachal could there be a violation of his rule
 is prakaar usne sari prithvi par "ekarat, hokar rajya kiya
 The authenticity of these Puranic victories of Mahapadmananda is also proved by some scattered references to the Kathasaritsagar, the elephant cave records of Kharavel and some records from Mysore
 jain or buddha granthon se ye praapt hota hai ki mahapadmanand kii do raniyon thi rani avantika or ranimura or donon maharaniyaan hi behad sundar or khubasurat thi mahapadmanand kii raniyon ke bare main adhik jaankaree nahi milti hai The Puranas state the ten sons of Mahapadmananda as the heir
 vahaan unke naam milte hai Ganga Pal, Panduk, Pandugati, Bhootpal, Rashtrapal, Govishanak, Dashasiddhak, Kaivart and Dhananand, Chand Nand chandragupta maury nand vansh ke sasthaashak chakravarti samraat mahapadmanand ke ve putr the jinka vaastavik naam chandranand tha jinaki maa ekbrahraman parivaar se thi mahapadmanand ke baad unke putr dhananand raja hue jinke dar se sikandar bhi bhaag gaya tha
 Dhanananda beat the minister Chanakya and drove him out of the assembly, because Chanakya sat on the throne before Dhananand
 chanakya ne dhananand ke sautele bhai chandranand ko bhadakaakar dhananand ko dhokhe se chandranand se maravakar chandranand kro raja banaaya or chandranand kro chandragupta maury naam diya 
 The Sumalya of the Puranas seems to be difficult to match to any of the eight names other than Mahapadma mentioned in Buddhist texts
 kintu sabhi milakar sankhya kii drushti se navanand kahe jate the
 There is no dispute in this
 puraanon main un sabakaa rajyakaal 100 varshon tak bataaya gaya he - 88 varshon tak mahapadmanand kaa or 12 varshon tak uske putron kaa
 But the same person continued to rule for 88 years and subsequent successive 8 kings should rule only for 12 years, it does not seem wise
 sinhalai anushrutiyon main navanandon kaa rajyakaal 40 varshon kaa bataaya gaya he or use ham sahi maan sakate hai
 Accordingly, the Nawanandas circa 364 BC
 From 324 BC Ruled until
 itnaa nishchit he ki unamem antim raja agramas arthath ugrasen kaa putr) sikandar ke akraman ke samay magadhaa kaa samrat tha, jisaki vishaal or shaktishaalee senaaon ke bhay se unani sipaahiyon ne poras se hue yuddh ke baad aage badhane se inkaar kar diya
 Plutarch says that Chandragupta Maurya met Alexander and spoke of his lowliness and unpleasantness in public
 sambhav he, dhananand ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye chandragupta ne us videshi akramanakari ke upyog kaa bhi praytn kiya ho
 It is known from the "mahavanshatika" that the last Nanda was a tough ruler and a person of greedy and scrupulous nature
 sambhavat: is lobhi prakruti ke kaaran hi use dhananand kaha gaya
 He also insulted Chanakya
 isaki pushti mudrarakshas naatak se hoti he, jisase gyaat hota he ki chanakya apane pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 Humiliated, he took the oath of annihilation of the Nanda Empire and with the support of Prince Chandragupta Maurya, he succeeded in that task
 un donon ne us kaary ke liye punjab ke kshetron se ek vishaal sena taiyaar kii, jisamen sambhavat: kuch videshi tatv or lutere vyakti bhi shaamil the
 It is also known that Chandragupta had made a treaty with Parvatak in the overthrow of Dhanananda
 usne magadh par do akraman kiye, yah sahi prathit hota he, parantu "divyavdaan" kii yah anushruti ki pehle usne sidhe magadh kii rajdhani patliputra par hi dhaava bol diya tathaa asafal hokar use or chanakya ko apane praan bachaane ke liye vesh banaakar bhaagna padaa, sahi nahin prathit hoti
 Probably between them, 324 BC The war took place when Chandragupta started the Mauryan dynasty in Pataliputra, the capital of Magadha
 nando kaa samrajya saamaajik, aarthik, raajnneetik sampannataa evam sainya sanghathan kaa charam bindu tha
 His largest well-organized army had 2 xxrep 5 0 footmen, 8 xxrep 4 0 cavalry, 8000 war chariots, 6000 elephants
 jisaki sahaayta se samraat mahapadmanand ne uttar pashchim, dakshin purv disha main bahut badi sainik vijay praapt kii or us samay ke lagbhag sabhi aas pados ke samrajyo kaa ant kar ke un kaa namonishaan mitaa diya
 For this reason, in the Puranas, he has been called Sarvakshatrantaka or another Parashurama
 vishwa vijeta sikandar ne bharat par akraman ke samay samraat ghanaanand kii vishaltam sena dekh kar ke hausala post ho gaya 
 In front of such a huge power, even a great world conqueror like Alexander, understood his goodness in returning only by bowing down
 samraat mahapadmanand ne tatkaaleen bharat kii vistrut sabhi 16 mahajanapadon kaashi, kaushal, vajji, mall,chedi,vatsa,ank, magadh, avaneet, kuru, paanchal, gandhar kamboj,shurasen ,ashmak, evam kaling ko jitkar evam susangathit kar pratham baar sudrudh kendriya prashasan kii niv daali tathaa aage aane vaali peedi ke shaskaon ko shashan karne kii utkrisht paddati sikhalaai jiskaa prabhaav aadhunik shashan paddati main bhi dikhaai padataa he
 That is why Chakravarti emperor Mahapadmananda is called the father of central governance
 nando kaa rajkosh dhan se bharaa rahata tha, jisamen 99 karod kii apaar swarna mudraaen thi
