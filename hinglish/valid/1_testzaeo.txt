 The general meaning of ideology is in political theory a set of ideas prevalent in a society or group on the basis of which it justifies or inappropriate a particular social, economic and political organization
 vichaardhaara ke aalochak bahudhaa ise ek aise vishwaas ke vishay ke rup main vyavahrut karte hai jiskaa koi vaigyanik aadhaar nahin hota
 It is argued that the followers of a particular ideology follow him by believing it to be true in itself, its verification is not considered necessary
 vastutah prayek vichaardhaara ke samarthak uski pushti ke liye kinchit siddhant or tark avashya prastut karte hai or duusare ke man main uske prati aasthaa or vishwaas paidaa karne kaa praytn karte hai
 In communism, ideology is considered a part of the superstructure, where it reflects economic relations

 The reason for the relative independence of ideology is that ideological development is under the influence of various non-economic factors
 ye kaarak hai : vichaardhaara ke vikaas main aantarik anukramik sambandh, vichaardhaara vishesh ke nirupakon kii nijee bhoomika tathaa vichaardhaara ke vibhinn roopon kaa parsparik prabhaav, aadi
 In the sixth and seventh decade of the twentieth century, mismatches of a scientific view of reality and ideology of reality became widely prevalent among bourgeois philosophers
 burjua vichaardhaara ko atmik pratyay kii bhanti maanate hai jo keval samooh yaa dal vishesh ke hiton ko vyakt karti he
 That is why they are willing to make differences between science and ideology, to keep them in competition

 The word 'lahnda' in Punjabi means 'west', from which these languages derive its name - the eastern sub-languages of Hindi are traditionally often called 'purbia' for comparison
 lahanda samooh main hindko, pothohari or saraaiki jaisi kai upbhashaayen shaamil hai
 Southern Hindi languages such as Saraiki have some similarity to Sindhi language while northern Hindi languages like Hindo have some similarities with Dardi languages
 oirat mongol logon kaa sabase pashchimtam samudaay he jo pashchimi mongolia ke altaai parvat kshetra main vaas karte hai
 This caste, formed by the integration of several tribes, originated in the eastern part of Central Asia, but now their largest group is found in the Republic of Kalmykia, Russia where they are called Kalmyk people

 According to some linguists, it is a western dialect of Punjabi, although there has been some controversy
 kuch pashtun log bhi hindko bolte hai
 The mother tongue of Punjabi can understand Hindus to a great extent
 duniya bhar main anumaanit 20-50 lakh log hindko bolte hai
 Some of Bollywood's most famous actors are from Indo-mother tongue families, such as Pran, Dilip Kumar and Shahrukh Khan
 raaj kapur, prithviraj kapur or uske parivaar ke anya sadsy bhi peshawar main rahe the or hindko bolte the
 There are many ideas about how the word Hindo came to be
 asia or iran se hindustan aane vaale aarambhik logon kaa hindukush parvat ko paar karne ke baad isi boli ke saath sampark sthapit hua
 Since after crossing Hindukush, there was no obstruction in the way of Hindustan, hence this dialect was called Hindustan Ki Boli or Hindko
 unani logon ne hindustan ke liye indicos shabd kaa prayog kiya he or isi liye yahan kii boli kaa naam hindko pada
 Some people even say that the Iranians gave it this name
 sindh ghati ke pahaado ke madhya yaa aage-peeche yah bhashaa boli jaati thi
 In Persian, there is the word koh for the word mountain and this is what made the word Hindo
 hindko ek hind-aryaa boli he
 Sanskrit language grammarian Panini also belonged to this area
 yah bhashaa bhi punjabi ke samaan prakrit se bani
 Nowadays, like the old times, Hindus are being spoken in those places which were the place of Gandhara Rahtal
 isliye hindko puraani gandhar rahatal kii bhi aam bolchaal kii bhashaa thi or yah sansakrut ke bhi nazadik thi
 Hindus speak the language as Hindus of Afghanistan

 Mahatma Gandhi started a fast on 20 September 1932 against the British government's acceptance of separate electoral system for Dalits while staying in Yerwada Jail in Pune
 As soon as the correspondence between Mahatma Gandhi and the British government was published, the news of his fast started on September 20, which got wide response in the country
 In his statement to the Government of Bombay on 15 September, Mahatma Gandhi said, "the decision of fasting has been made in the name of God, by his work and according to his command as i humbly believe
 To do true religious work for the main purpose of this fast
 The soul of Hindus has to be persecuted
 The question of untouchable classes being mainly religious, i consider it to be a special question
 " On the one hand, there was a nationwide demand to change that government decision, on the other hand, the spirit of ending untouchability was awakened
 To solve this, several meetings of national leaders were held, which resulted in the Yerwada Agreement, also known as Poona Pact
 This agreement was signed on 24 September 1932 by Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar and MC Raja on behalf of Dalits and Pt
 Madan Mohan Malaviya on behalf of upper caste Hindus
 With this agreement, Harijan Sevak Sangh came into existence and Dalits got holy name like Harijan

 Later on 26 September 1932, in the presence of Rabindranath Thakur, Gandhiji broke his fast saying that if reforms related to prevention of untouchability were not completed in a reasonable time, then i would definitely have to fast again
 parantu is vishay par gandhi ji ko punah upwas karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin paddy kyoki chauthe din 30 sitambar 1932 ko bombay main madan mohan malviya ji kii adhyakshata main ek baithak hui jisamen desh ke sabhi hindu netaaon ne nishchay kiya ki asprishyata nivaaran ke liye ek akhil bhartiya asprishyata virdohi mandal anti antchenility lig sthapit kiya jaay jinka pradhan karyaalay dilli main ho tathaa jisaki shakhayein vibhinn praanton main sthapit hon saath hi jo asprishyata unmoolan ke uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye nimna kaarykram chalaaye

 mukhya hind-arya bhashaaon kaa vistaar indo-aryan languages are a sub-branch of the indo-iranian branch of indo-european languages, also known as the 'indian sub-branch'
 inamen se adhiktar bhashaayen sanskrit se janmi hai
 In indo-aryan languages, consonants like 'D', 'dh' and 'F' are preserved in the adi-indo-european language, which have disappeared in other branches
 is samooh main yah bhashaayen aati hai : sanskrit, hindi, urdu, bangla, kashmiri, sindhi, punjabi, nepali, romani, asamiya, gujarati, marathi, ityadi
 In the last two centuries, linguists have classified indo-aryan languages in many ways and these systems have changed from time to time
 aadhunik kaal main nimna vyavastha adhiktar bhashavaigyanikon ke liye maanya he or masika va cousen ke prayaason par aadhaarit he
 Some notable languages are: domaari–romani or paryaa aitihaasik rup se madhya kshetra kii sadsy thi lekin bhugolic duuri ke kaaran unamem kai vyakaraniya or shabdic badlaav aae hai
 These languages have developed from Magadhi Apabhramsa

 There can be different ways of legalizing black money and it can range from simple to complex to modern techniques
 kai viniamak or sarkari praadhikaran duniya bhar main yaa apni rashtriya arthvyavastha ke bheetar vaid banaae gaye kaale dhan kii maatra ke liye har saal anumaan jari karte hai
 In 1996, the International Monetary Fund estimated that between two and five percent of the global economy was involved in the legalization of black money
 haalanki, kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii prakriya kaa muqabla karne ke liye ek antahsarkaari nikaay, efeetief kaa gathan kiya gaya tha jisane yah sweekaar kiya ki "kul milakar vaid banaae gaye kaale dhan kii maatra kaa ek vishwasaneey anumaan prastut karnaa puri tarah se asambhav he or isliye efeetief dwaara is sandarbh main koi aankada prakashit nahin kiya jaataa he
 Similarly academic commentators have also been unable to estimate the amount of this money up to any level of acceptance
 maapan main kathinaayee ke baavjood har saal vaid banaae jane vaale kaale dhan kii raashi arabon main he or yah sarkaron ke liye ek mahatvapurn niti sambandhi chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya he
 As a result, there have been attempts by governments and international bodies to intimidate, prevent, and catch those who legalize black money

 The process of legalizing black money is often completed in three stages: first, cash is injected into the financial system by some means, the second phase involves executing complex financial transactions in order to camouflage the illegal source, and the last step
 Receiving money generated from transactions of illegal amounts makes it unavoidable
 inamen se kuch charnon ko paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par choda ja saktaa he; udhaaharan ke liye, vittiya pranali main pehle se maujuud gaiyr-nakadi aay ke placement kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin hogi
 The process of money laundering takes many different forms, although most methods can be classified into some of these types
 inamen "bank kii vidhiyaan, smarfing, mudra vinimay or doharaa-chaalaan bananaa" shaamil hai
 In many jurisdictions, a list of specific criminal offenses as a "self-launderer" is adopted for lawsuits to legalize black money

 Other tasks include training institutions that have the legal responsibility for international and regional cooperation in reporting information, developing laws and regulations to support national-level AML objectives, and the development of AML typology and countermeasures
 bangladesh main is mudde ko privansion of mani londring act, 2002 dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 With reference to Section 2 "money laundering means property acquired or acquired directly or indirectly through illegal means; illegal transfer, conversion, acquired directly or indirectly through legal or unlawful means in the above act or To hide the location or cooperation of the property acquired
 " In this act, "assets mean movable or immovable property of any nature and description"
 To prevent these illegal uses of money, the Bangladesh Government has introduced the Money Laundering Restraint Act
 is adhinium ko varsh 2009 main aakiri baar sanshodhit kiya gaya tha or sabhi vittiya santhaan is adhinium kaa anusaran karte hai
 Till date 26 circulars have been issued by Bangladesh Bank under this Act
 kaale dhan ko vaid banane se rokane ke liye ek banker ko nimnlikhit upaay avashya karnaa chahie: European Union Directive 2005 / 60 / EC which is designed to legalize black money and prevent the use of financial system for terrorist financing, it is designed for banks, real estate agents and many other companies for cash of more than 15000 euro
 Attempts to prevent such crimes by mandating use investigations and reports
 mani-londring nirodh adhinium, 2002 1 july 2005 ko prabhaav main aayaa tha
 Section 12 lays down the following obligations on banks, financial institutions and intermediaries to maintain records detailing the nature and value of the transactions to be directed, whether such transactions involve a single transaction or are interconnected Include a series of transactions and where such series of transactions are seen within a month; Presenting the information of transactions referred to in the clause and the records of the identity of all its customers to the Director within the period to be determined
 dhara 12 main yah praavdhaan he ki uparokt ullikhit up-khand main sanderbhit recordon ko lenden puraa hone ke baad das saal tak banaae rakhaa janaa chahie
 The provisions of the Act are often reviewed and various amendments have been passed from time to time
 bharat main kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii haal kii gatividhiyaan raajnneetik dalon, corporate companiyon or share bazaar ke madhyam se hui hai
 In Britain, the control of the law of money laundering and terrorist financing is governed by four acts of primary legislation: - aapraadhik aay adhinium 2002 main praathmik britain mani londering-virdohi kanoon ke saath-saath "viniyamit kshetra" ke bheetar kaarobaar ke liye aavashyak praavdhaan shaamil hai jinke jariye graahakon yaa anya vyaktiyon dwaara kaale dhan ko vaid banane ke andeh kii soochna adhikariyon ko di jaati he
 The process of money laundering in Britain has been widely defined
 vastav main kisi bhi aparaadh kii kisi bhi aay kaa sanchaalan yaa bhagidaari ek kaale dhan ko vaid banane kaa aparaadh ho saktaa he
 The ownership of the proceeds of a crime of its own by an offender falls within the definition of legalizing black money in Britain
 yah paribhaasha un gatividhiyon ko bhi shaamil karti he jo ek prakriya ke rup main kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii paramparaagat paribhaasha ke bheetar aati he jiske dwaara aparaadh kii aay ko is prakaar gupt rakhaa yaa chipa diya jaataa he jisase ki yah ek vaid strot se aayi hui prathit hoti he
 Unlike some other jurisdictions, crimes that legalize black money in the UK are not limited to the proceeds of serious crimes, nor are there any monetary limits, nor are there any actions for the amount of a crime to legalize black money
 There is no need to create an objective or a money laundering design
 britain ke kanoon ke tahat kaale dhan ko vaid banane vaale kisi aparaadh main dhanrashi kaa shaamil hona jaruri nahin he kyonki mani londering ke kaanoon main kisi bhi prakaar ke vivaran kii sampatti shaamil he
 As a result, any person who commits an acquisitive crime in the UK is also committing the crime of legalizing money essentially under UK law
 yah ek aise vyakti par bhi lagu hota he jo aapraadhik aacharan dwaara kisi daayitv se batch nikalataa he -- jise vakeelon dwaara "ek aarthik laabh praapt karnaa" kaha jaataa he -- kyonki aisa samajha jaataa he ki is prakaar vah jis daayitv se batch kar nikal gaya he uske baraabar mulya kii dhanrashi use praapt ho jaati he
 Major crimes which legalize black money carry a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment
 madhyamik viniman kaa praavdhaan mani londring vinium 2003 or 2007 dwaara kiya gaya he
 One consequence of this act is that lawyers, accountants and persons engaged in the business of bankruptcy who suspect that their clients are involved in tax evasion or other criminal activities through which they have obtained any benefit, now have their doubts The authorities have to give information about In most circumstances, it would be a 'secret notice' of a crime by an informer to inform the subject of his information that a notice has been prepared
 haalanki in praavdhaanon ke liye visheshadhikrut paristhitiyon main yaa jahaan soochna kanoonee peshevraana visheshadhikaar ke adheen he, kuch peshewaron dwaara praapt jaankaree kaa khulaasa adhikariyon ke saamne karnaa aavashyak nahin he
 Business guidance is provided by industry groups as well as the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group and the Law Society
 haalanki banking sansthaaon par ek nirdhaarit mulya se adhik maudrik jamaa yaa sthaanantaran kii niyamit soochna dene kaa koi daayitv nahin he
 Instead all suspicious deposits or transfers should be reported regardless of their value
 soochna ke dayitvon main anya deshon main kiye gaye un aacharan se sambandhit laabhon ke sandehon kii soochna dena shaamil he jo britain main kiye jane kii sthiti main aapraadhik hoga
 Later exceptions to certain activities were added, exceptions that were valid at the place where these activities took place, such as the bull fighting in Spain
 britain main salanaa taur par adhikariyon ko prastut kii jane vaali kaale dhan ko vaid banane ke andeh kii suchanaaen 200,000 se adhik hai 
 inamen se adhikansh suchanaaen bainkon or isi tarah kii vittiya sansthaaon dwaara prastut kii jaati hai 
 Although 5,108 different organizations submitted reports of suspicious activity to authorities in the year ended 30 September 2010, nearly half of all information was submitted by only four organizations and three-quarters of all information was reported by Top 20 reporting
 Organizations
 kisi anya vyakti dwaara kaale dhan ko vaid banane ke andeh kii soochna dene main naakaam rahane ke aparaadh ke liye adhiktam 5 varsh ke karawas kaa praavdhaan he

 We celebrate 'world Environment Day' on 5 June every year; But this day does not awaken true inspiration in our mind
 kyonki iske saath itihaas kii koi prerak ghatana ke nahin judi
 On this day, there are some processions, sit-ins, demonstrations, speeches; But it does not affect the minds of ordinary people

 People of Bishnoi community live in Rajasthan and many other areas of India
 unke guru jambheshwar ji ne apane anuyaayiyon ko hare ped na kaatane, pashu-pakshiyon ko na maarane tathaa jal ganda na karne jaise 29 niyam diye the
 Because of these 20 + 9 rules, his disciples are called Bishnoi

 On his orders, hundreds of woodcutters along with the soldiers started cutting down shami trees in the nearby village of Khedjali
 jaise hi yah samachar us kshetra main rahane vaale bishnoiyon ko mila, ve iskaa virodh karne lage
 When the soldiers refused, hundreds of villagers led by a courageous woman 'imrati Devi'; Including children and elders, men and women; Clinged to trees unhone sainikon ko bataa diya ki unki deh ke katane ke baad hi koi haraa ped cat paayegaa
 What was the effect of these things on the soldiers? They were tied to the Rajya, then the villagers were by virtue
 atah vrikshon ke saath hi gramvaasiyon ke ang bhi katkar dharti par girane lage
 First of all, Veerangana 'imrati Devi' was attacked with ruthless axes and she became the first woman in the world to die for tree protection
 is balidaan se utsahit gramvasi puri takat se pedo se chipak gayi
 In Garhwal in the 20th century, Gaura Devi, Chandiprasad Bhatt and Sundarlal Bahuguna launched the 'chipko Movement' for the preservation of trees, its inspiration was Imrati Devi

 During this, 363 people sacrificed
 inamen imarti devi kii teenon putriyon sahit 69 mahilaayein bhi thim
 Finally, the king himself came and apologized and banned the cutting of green trees
 gramvaasiyon ko usase koi bair to tha nahin, unhone raja ko kshamaa kar diya
 In memory of that historical event, there is a big fair on 'bhadrapad Shukla 10' even today

 In 1937, he laid the foundation of 'bamnia Ashram' in Jhabua district and started to remove the evil practices prevalent in the Bhils

 After some time, a Seth, influenced by him, gave him the upper floor of his house in 'thandla' without rent
 yahan mamaa ji ne chatravaas banaaya
 Gradually, the faith in the local people began to wane 1937 ke bheeshan akaal ke baad isai mishanri vahaan raahat kaary hetu aaye; par unki ruchi seva main kam or dharmantaran main adhik thi
 Seeing this, Mama ji got the Bhils to Janeu in exchange for the cross with the written consent of Shankaracharya of Puri
 kuch roodhiwaadee hindu sansthaaon ne iskaa virodh kiya; par mamaa ji us kshetra kii vaastavik sthiti ko acchhee tarah jaanate the
 Therefore, they continued in this work
 isse vahaan dharmantaran par kaaphi roak lagi
 Gradually, their discussion started everywhere
 seth jugalkishor birla ne baamaniya stesan ke paas pahari par ek bhavy ram mandir banwaaya
 Even today he is looked after by his family members
 mishanri vahaan carch banane vaale the; par mamaa ji ne unka yah shadyantr vifal kar diya
 Mama ji was also associated with Arya Samaj and Socialist Party
 unke ashram main subhaashachandr bose, acharya narendra dev, jaiprakash narayan, da0 raamamanohar lohia, choudhary charansingh, george furnandis jaise netaa aate rahete the; par mamaa ji ne raajnneeti kii apeksha seva kaary ko hi pradhanta di
 Mama ji was born into a wealthy family; But when they accepted the service fast, then they started living like them among the Bhils
 ve bhi unke saath chanaa, jau or chunni ke aate kii moti roti khate the
 Mama ji edited the magazine 'gobar' published by the Ashram for six years
 unka dehant 26 disambar, 1998 ko ashram main hi hua
 After the demise of maternal uncle, his samadhi was erected and the statue established
 tatkaaleen khaadya mantri sharad yadav evam railmantri nitish kumaar uske anaavaran ke samay vahaan aaye the
 The Bhils of the adjoining districts consider Mama ji as a deity and even today they offer the first crop of the year to the ashram
 prativarsh teen baar vahaan sammelan hota he, jahaan hajaaron log ekatra hokar mamaa ji ko shraddhasuman arpit karte hai
 Many students studying from Bamnia Ashram today are in higher government and private services

 monitor yaa disple computaron ke liye nirmit ek electronic vijual disple he
 The monitor includes a display device, circuitry and an enclosure
 aadhunik monitoron kaa disple upkaran aam taur par ek thin film transistor liquid crystal disple kaa ek patala panel hota he jabaki puraane monitoron main ek cathod re tub kaa istemaal hota he jisaki gaharaai lagbhag screen ke aakaar jitani hoti he
 Computer monitors were originally used as television receivers for data processing and entertainment; Along with data processing, the use of computers for entertainment is also increasing
 vishesh rup se data ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale disple kaa pahalu anupaat 4:3 hota he; manoranjan ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale disple kaa pahalu anupaat bhi aam taur par 16:9 widescreen hota he or kabhi-kabhi iske samanvay rup jaise 16:10 kaa bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Approximately the size of a rectangular display is usually expressed as the distance between two opposite screen corners, ie the diagonal of a rectangle
 is vidhi ke saath ek samasya yah he ki isamen pradarshan pahalu anupaat ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa jaataa he isliye udhaaharan ke liye 16:9 21 inch widescreen disple kii oonchaai or kshetrafal 21 inch 4:3 screen kii tulana main bahut kam hota he
 The dimensions of the 4: 3 screen are 16
8 inches × 12
6 inches and the area is 211 square inches while the dimensions and area of the widescreen are 18
3 inches × 10
3 inches and 188 square inches respectively
 kai prayojanon se disple kii oonchaai ko mukhya maandand mana jaataa he; ek hi oonchaai vaale 4:3 disple kii tulana main 16:9 disple kaa vikarn 22% bada hona jaruri he
 This method of measurement is derived from the method used for the first generation of CRT televisions when a circular tube with usually a circular face was used
 vrittakar hone kii vajah se unke aakaar kaa varnan karne ke liye keval unke vyas kii jarurat thi
 Since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images, the measurement of the diagonal of the rectangle was equal to the diameter of the tube face
 is tareeke kaa istemaal us vakt bhi hota rahaa jab cathod re tubon kaa nirmaan gol aayaton ke rup main kiya gaya; isamen aakaar ko nirdisht karne vaali ekmaatr sankhya hone kaa phayda tha or is baat ko lekar isamen koi bhram nahin tha jab pahalu anupaat har jagah 4:3 tha
 The use of the shape of its image element rather than its visible image was a complex process when describing the size of the monitor in promotional and advertising materials
 siarti disple main siarti screen kaa ek bahut bada hissaa overscan kii vajah se monitor ke "surakshit kshetra" ke baahar ke kshetron ko chhipaane ke liye cese ke begel ke peeche chhip jaataa he yaa dhank jaataa he
 These practices or processes were considered to be misleading, and widespread consumer objections and lawsuits forced most manufacturers to measure visible sizes in the end
 kisi monitor ke pradarshan kaa maapan nimnlikhit mandandon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he: Friendly argument: pratikul tark: Friendly argument: pratikul tark: Friendly argument: pratikul tark: Phosphor burn-in is the localized lifespan of the phosphor layer of a CRT screen where it has demonstrated a long-term static image
 iske parinamswaroop screen par sthaayee rup se yahan tak ki band kar dene par bhi, aspasht chhavi kaa nirmaan hota he
 It can be possible to read some text words even in its serious cases, although this happens only where the displayed text has remained intact for years
 bern-in yaa jalane kii samasya aam taur par sabase zyada nimnlikhit anuprayogon main dekha jaataa he: Screensavers were developed as a means of avoiding burn-in which was a widespread problem of IBM personal computer monochrome monitors in the 1980s
 monocrome disple par aam taur par bern-in kaa khatra adhik rahata he kyonki phosphor pratyaksh rup se electron beam ke saamne hota he jabaki rangeen disple main shadow mask se kuch sangrakshan praapt hoti he
 LCD monitors do not necessarily have a screen saver even though they are still found in newer computers
 siarti ko kai ghanton tak 100% ujjvalata ke saath chalaakar phosphor bern-in ko "thik" kiya ja saktaa he lekin yah sabhi phosphor ko samaan rup se jalaakar keval nuksaan ko chipa detaa he
 CRT reconstructors can repair the monochrome display by cutting the front section of the picture tube, removing the damaged phosphor, replacing it, and re-sealing the tube
 color disple ko saidhantik rup se thik kiya ja saktaa he lekin yah ek kathin or mahangi prakriya he or aisa aam taur par keval peshewar prasaaran monitoron par hi kiya jaataa he 
 The problem of burn-in once again emerged as a concern for early plasma displays that are at greater risk than CRT
 sthaniyakrut jalane kii ghatana ko kam karne ke liye inke saath chalati hui chhaviyon vaale screen severon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Changing the color scheme that is already in use from time to time also helps in this
 chamak prakaash or screen ke bich ke sambandh kii vajah se yaa chamakdaar dhoop main monitoron kaa istemaal karne kii vajah se hone vaali ek samasya he
 Matte finish lcds and screen crts have a lower risk of reflective glare than traditional curved crts or glossy lcds and aperture grille crts that are bent on only one axis and have a lower risk on them than other crts folded on both axes
 it happens
 monitor ko sthanantarit karne yaa prakaash vyavastha ko samyojit karne ke baavjood samasya bani rahati he to chamak ko kam karne or contrast main sudhaar karne ke liye behad barik kaale taron ke ek jaal kaa istemaal karke screen par ek filter ko sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 These filters were quite popular in the late 1980s
 ve prakaash pratifal ko bhi kam karte hai
 The above mentioned filter will only work against reflective brightness; Direct brightness will completely erase most of the internal lighting of the monitors and can only be dealt with by using a hood or transelective LCD
 sahi dhang se sanrekhit video projectoron or krambaddh lead ko chhodkar zyaadaatar disple praudyogikiyaan khaas taur par alsidi main rang channelon kaa ek anternihit galat panjikaran hota he arthath laal, hare or nile binduon ke kendra acchhee tarah se panktibaddh nahin hote hai
 Subpixel rendering depends on this misalignment; The technologies used are Apple Two since 1976 and more recently Microsoft and Xfree 86
 arjibi disple zyaadaatar lekin sabhi nahin, drishy rangeen spectrum prastut karata he
 This can be a problem where good color matching is required with non-rgb images
 yah mudda arjibi model istemaal karne vaali sabhi monitor praudyogikiyon ke liye aam he
 Recently, Sharp has introduced a four-color TV to improve it
 electromecanical purvavartiyon kii kaaryaatmak samanta kii vajah se graphics kshamta rahit diisi vity05 jaise aarambhik siarti aadhaarit vidiu par glass teletip kaa label lag gaya
 Some historical computers had no screen display and instead used teletypes, modified electric typewriters, or printers
 aarambhik gharelu computaron jaise aipal tu or camodor 64 main tivi yaa color compojit monitor ko chalaane ke liye ek compojit signal output kaa istemaal hota tha
 As a result, due to abnormalities in the broadcast TV standards used, the resolution level dropped
 video game consol ke saath abhi bhi is tareeke kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 S-video inputs were used in Commodore monitors to improve resolution, but this was not common in televisions until the advent of hdtvs
 aarambhik digital monitoron ko kabhi-kabhi titiel bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki laal, hare or nile inputon kaa voltage titiel logic chipon ke anuroop tha
 Subsequent digital monitors support LVDS or TMDS protocols
 aarambhik ibiem pisi or chlonon main istemaal hone vaale emd, harculas, sijie or ijie graphics adapter ke saath istemaal kiye jane vaale monitoron ko titiel logic ke madhyam se niyantrit kiya jaataa tha
 Such monitors can be identified with the mail DE-9 connector commonly used in video cable
 titiel monitoron kaa ek avagun yah tha ki video signal ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale digital bits kii kam sankhya kii vajah se uplabdh rangon kii sankhya simit thi
 Modern monochrome monitors use the same 15-pin SVGA connector as standard color monitors
 ve 1024x768 rijolushan par 32-bit grescale kaa pradarshan karne main sakasham hai jo unhen aadhunik computaron ke saath interphes karne main sakasham banaata he
 TTL monochrome monitors used only five of the nine pins
 ek pin kaa istemaal aadhaar ke rup main or do pin kaa istemaal kshaitij yaa lambavat tulykaalan ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The electron gun was controlled by two different digital signals, a video bit and an intensity bit, to control the brightness of the lined pixels
 keval chaar shed sambhav the; kaala, mand, madhyam yaa ujjwal
 CGA monitors used four digital signals, known as RGBI or Red Green and Blue Plus Intensity, to control the three electrons used in color CRT
 in teen arjibi rangon main se prayek ko swatantra rup se chaalu yaa band kiya ja saktaa he
 The intensity bit increases the brighterness of all currents or if there is no color current, then the intensity bit will turn on all the guns at very low brightness to produce a dark gray color
 sijie monitor keval 16 rangon ko pratipaadit karne main sakasham he
 CGA monitors were not exclusively used by pc-based hardware
