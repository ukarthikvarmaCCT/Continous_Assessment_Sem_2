 In terms of mechanics, the Young coefficient or Young's modulus is the measure of the elasticity of a homogeneous material
 yah eiksheeya pratibal evam vikruti ke anupaat ke rup main paribhaashit he
 Sometimes it is also mistakenly called the elasticity modulus because the Young coefficient is the most prevalent and most commonly used modulus of all elasticity coefficients
 iske atirikt do or 'pratyasthata mapank' hai - aaytan pratyasthata mapank evam aparupan gunank
 The value of Young's modulus, E, can be calculated by dividing the distortion in stress

 Forged from the Love of Liberty ghanatv The West Indies Union, also known in English as the Federation of the West Indies, was a short-lived Caribbean Union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962

 The express purpose of the League was to create a political entity that would have been an independent state separate from Britain - possibly similar to the Canadian Federation, Australian Union, or Central African Union; However, before this happened, the union collapsed due to internal political conflict

 In a broader context, the WIFLP was composed of urban-based parties throughout the federation, while the DLP consisted of rural-based parties

 The likely leader of the WIFLP was Norman Manley, Prime Minister of Jamaica, and then arguably the premier of Trinidad & Tobago, Dr
 Eric Williams
 lekin donon hi ne sangheey chunaav nahin ladaa or apane sambandhit dweep ke niyantran ko banaae rakhane ko pasand kiya
 This meant that the leaders of the two most important provinces did not see the Union as viable
 isi tarah, dlapi ke jamcon sansthaapak alexander bastamante ne bhi sangh ke chunaav ke liye manaa kar diya or trinidadian eshford sinanan ke liye party netritv chhod diya
 The absence of prominent Jamaican leaders in any role at the federal level undermined the federation's unity
 rajya parishad ke anya sadasyon main shaamil the: There were several units under general services for the entire federation: sangh kii salaahkaar sevaaon main shaamil the: The politics of this nascent union was demolished by conflicts between the federal government and provincial governments, and between the two largest provinces and the smaller provinces

 Moreover, the post of Prime Minister was quite weak

 The Union in particular maintained close ties with Canada, whose past was also similar in that it was a federation of several former British colonies

 However, the immediate catalyst for the dissolution of the League was Jamaican dissent
 1961 tak, rajya ke maamalon ko lekar jamaica main asantosh ke kai kaaran paidaa ho gaye the: The most important reason for Jamaica being dissatisfied was the continuation of the Union's colonial status
 jamaica, sangh main isiilie shaamil hua tha kyonki uske netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki west indies ko jaldi hi swatantraaa de di jaaegi
 About three years after the formation of the Union, this did not happen, meanwhile, smaller British colonies such as Cyprus and Sierra Leone had gained independence

 At the same time there were problems with the capital proposed by the Union, Chaugaramasa, at that time it was in the hands of the United States
 carabian praant ke kai netaa mahasang kii rajdhani ke rup main chaugaaramas ko chaahate the
 Regional leaders such as Jamaica's Norman Manley and Dr

 haalaanki america or britain asahmat the or mahasang ke pradhanmantri grantle adams ne chaugaaramas ko praapt karne se prantiy netaaon ko inkaar kar diya tha
 Many Jamaicans felt that the Sangh was disrupting their development process and the independence movement

 Antigua's Prime Minister Ware Bird replied that his province in the Union is an equal share of Trinidad, not like "a little Tobago"
 unhone sanket kiya ki ek majboot mahasang sweekaarya tha basharte ek ekaatmak rajya banane kaa koi bhi prayaas nahin kiya gaya ho
 Negotiations on this new union began in September 1961; However, he indicated that Trinidad would have to provide 75 to 80 percent of the new federation's revenue

 However, these talks ultimately proved fruitless

 Barbados at this time refused to bear the financial burden on its shoulder and Antigua and Grenada began to become interested with the idea of merging with Jamaica and Trinidad respectively

 Several alternative techniques, such as chemical sensitization, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics of cells, are available
 ant main, transfect kii gai in koshikaon ko pravardhit kiya jaataa he
 As the efficiency of the methods described above is typically low, it is necessary to identify cells that have been successfully transfected with a vector construct with the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation

 adah kai prakaar ke khanij siliketon ke samooh ko, jo reshedaar tathaa adahya hote hai, kehete hai
 Its fibers are shiny
 ikattha rahane par unka rang safed, haraa, bhura yaa nila dikhaai padataa he, parantu prayek alag reshe kaa rang chamkila safed hi hota he
 This substance has many properties, such as fibrous texture, insulating force, stiffness, infinite resistance to electricity, non-dissolving in acid and asbestos
 in gunon ke kaaran yah bahut se udyongon main kaam aata he
 Asbestos can normally be divided into the following two castes - adah kii sabase adhik upyog hone vaali jati kaa chrisotile he
 This substance is found in the thin arteries of the serpentine rocks and is chemically simple magnesium silicate
 in dhamniyon main safed yaa hare rang kaa manim reshmi resha paaya jaataa he
 70 percent of this type of asbestos is extracted from the quibeque quarries of Canada

 This type of asbestos is found in the form of fibers, but the fibers are often of irregular order
 in dhamniyon kii lambaai kabhi-kabhi kai foot tak hoti he
 This type of asbestos is found in the following subcastes: pichhali donon upjatiyon ke adah kaa rang safed se halkaa haraa tak hota he
 The color thickness depends on the amount of iron
 inke reshe main adhik loch nahin hoti, at ye bunane ke kaam main nahin aa sakate
 They melt hard and dissolve very little in acid
 inaki amla chaanane or vidyut upkaran banane ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Acinolite asylumite and tremolite species are found in abundance in India
 inke milane kii jagahen nimnlikhit hai: Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 adah kii khaane mitti kii sataha ke neeche milti hai
 Asbestos found from 500 to 600 feet below is extracted by open field method
 isse or adhik gaharaai main paae jane vaale adah ke nikaalane main ve hi vidhiyaan prayukt hoti hai jo anya dhaatuon ke liye apanaai jaati hai
 In India, asbestos is extracted by piercing with hand and bursts and bursting with explosive material and hammers, but in other countries, such as South America and the United Nations, pneumatic burms are used
 adah ko chhedate samay jal kaa prayog nahin kiya janaa, kyonki pani ke saath milane par spanji mishran ban jaataa he, jisamen se isko alag nikaalnaa kathin ho jaataa he
 After filtering raw asbestos, it is beaten heavily with hammers
 isse adah ke reshon main lage hue pathar ke tukade tathaa anya vastuen dur ho jaati hai
 It is then poured into the crushing mill
 baad main reshon ko hawa ke jhonke se alag kar liya jaataa he
 Finally the dust is completely pulled by sucking air from the absorbent pumps by pouring it on a moving filter
 iske uparaant adah kaa moolyankan hota he
 The following four asbestos mails are sent to the market: adah kaa moolyankan isko jalaane ke baad bachi hui raakh ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he- If good asbestos is rubbed between the fingers, then it becomes a silk-like object that does not break quickly when pulled
 ghatiya mail ke adah ke chote-chote tukade ho jate hai; vah kathor bhi hota he
 If the thin asbestos of the fine asbestos is pulled slowly from the tip of the thumb, the fibers of the asbestos get good or they are divided into fine fibers, but the lower grade asbestos fibers are completely broken
