 It is also worshiped in the feminine form of Shri Gayatri Devi

 The names of these seven verses are - Gayatri, Ushnik, Anushtupa, Brihati, Virat, Tritupa and Jagati
 gayatri chand main aath-aath aksharon ke teen charan hote hai
 Among the mantras of the Rigveda, Gayatri verses have the highest number except the trinity

 Therefore, when the symbol of creation was conceived in the form of verses or speech, then this world was considered the form of Tripada Gayatri

 vah paramatma hamaari buddhi ko sanhmaarg main prerit kare
 This mantra is first quoted in the Rigveda
 iske rishi vishwamitra hai or devtaa savita hai
 Though this mantra is only one of the 18 mantras of this sukta of Vishwamitra, but the Rishis had experienced its glory from the beginning in the sense of meaning and among the 10 Sahasra mantras of the entire Rigveda, the most serious euphemism of the meaning of this mantra
 done
 is mantra main 24 akshar hai
 There are three stages of eight letters each
 kintu brahman granthon main or kalantar ke samast sahitya main in aksharon se pehle teen vyahritiyaan or unase purv pranav yaa onkaar ko jodakar mantra kaa puraa swaroop is prakaar sthir hua: This form of the mantra is called Manu by Sapranava, Savyahritika Gayatri and has done the same in chanting
 gayatri tatv kya he or kyon is mantra kii itani mahima he, is prashn kaa samaadhaan aavashyak he
 According to Aarash belief, Gayatri gives a complete explanation of the interrelationship of Virat Vishva on the one hand and human life on the other, Devatattva on the one hand and Ghosts on the other, Mind on the one hand and Prana on the other, Knowledge on one hand and Karma on the other

 The awakened mind in the awakening is the great power of man
 jaise savita dev he vaise man bhi dev he

 ise hi gayatri ke tisare charan main kaha gaya he

 is gayatri mantra main anya kisi prakaar kii kaamana nahin pai jaati
 The only desire here is that the divine power that man has received from God in the form of mind, he should know the same savita and through deeds make him meaningful in this life
 gayatri ke purv main jo teen vyahritiyaan hai, ve bhi sahetuk hai

 euclid, yaa ukladis, pracheen yunaan kaa ek ganitagya tha
 He is called the "father of geometry"
 uski elimants naamak pustak ganit ke itihaas main safaltam pustak he
 In this book, many principles of geometry have been executed on the basis of a few self-determination
 inke naam par hi is tarah kii jyamiti kaa naam eucalidia jyamiti padaa
 Even after thousands of years, Euclid's method of proving mathematical theorems remains the backbone of all mathematics euclid ne shankavon, goleey jyamiti or sambhavat: dwighaateey talon par bhi pustaken likhin
 Euclid was a Greek mathematician who lived about 325 years before Christ
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki plato ke shishyon se hi athens main inhone apni praarambhik shiksha praapt kii thi
 It was contemporary of Ptolemy I, who ruled from 306 years before Christ to 283 years ago
 euclid ne ] main ek paathshaala sthapit kii thi
 Apart from this, nothing is known about Euclid
 kuch log inhen galati se megaaraa kaa euclid samajhate the, jo kaa samakaleen tha, parantu yah unka bhram tha, jisko ek lekhak ne 1572 i0 main dur kiya
 Euclid's greatest treatise is 'elements', which is in 13 parts
 isse pehle bhi bahut se ganitagyon ne jyamitiyaan likhi thim, parantu un sab ke baad jo jyamiti euclid ne likhi uski barabari aaj tak koi nahin kar sakaa he or na sansar main ajtak koi aisi pustak likhi gai jisane kisi vigyaan ke kshetra main bina badale hue lagbhag 2,000 varsho tak apana prabhutv jamaaye rakhaa ho or jo mul main 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak padhai jaati rahi ho
 Euclid gave new origins
 utpattiyon ke kram bhi badal die, jisase puraani utpattiyaan sab bekaar ho gai
 One has to admit that the book was designed to be his own
 usne us samay tak ke sabhi anusandhanon ko apni pustak main de diya tha
 He wrote all the facts in a very logical manner in such a way that each new theorem was based on the facts of his earlier theorems
 aisa karte karte euclid aise tathyon par pahunche jinke liye pramaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 He called such facts axiomatic
 aise swayansidhon kii sankhya kahin chah, yaa kahin baarah he
 The final axiom is as follows
 yadi ek rekha do rekhaon ko kaate or ek ore ant:kone kaa yoga do samakon se kam he
 For a long time no one dared to criticize about this axiom, but people objected to consider it as axiomatic
 yahan tak ki bahut anveshan hue
 It was only in the 19th century that people were able to come to the conclusion that the above axiom is not true, from which they invented acuclideal geometry
 aj Euclid has also written other texts, some of which have been found and some have not
 jo granth mili hai, ve nimnlikhit he Data There are 94 theorems in this, which relate to how some elements of a shape are known, then how to extract the others
 bhaag - yah pustak mul rup main to nahin mili parantu paris main iskaa arabi bhashaa main roopaantar mila
 It was edited in 1851 in European languages
 is pustak main kisi akruti ko baraabar bhaagon, yaa kisi niyat anupaat ken baantne ke sambandh main bahut se prameya die hai
 Optics - a book with this name exists in Greek
 phenomina - is granth main gole kii jyamiti kii vyakhya kii he, jo jyotish se sambandh rakhti he
 a book on anthemology is also written, but it does not appear to be written by Euclid
 anya granth, jinka pataa nahin chalaa he, nimnlikhit he: a treatise to warn novices from misconceptions

 Euclid's Elements has been translated into many languages
 iskaa sabase pehle latin or arabi main anuwaad hua, jiskaa 1570 i0 main angreji main anuwaad hua
 In 1798, a city named Euclid was established in memory of this mathematician, which is in Ohio, USA

 He argues that the books that Euclid is described as the creator of, etc
, are a much later work

 On 14 August 1947, India split and Pakistan was born in a new country in the east and west
 pakistan ke kaayade aazam mohammad ali jinnah kaa sapana saakaar hua
 With the formation of a new country, the work of choosing different symbols and symbols for the country also started
 desh kaa jhanda pehle hi taiyaar ho chukaa tha, lekin raashtra-geet nahi bana tha
 At the time of independence, Pakistan had no national anthem
 isliye jab bhi dhvaj vandan hota " pakistan jindabad, azaadi pindabad" ke naare lagate the
 Jinnah did not accept this
 ve chaahate the ki pakistan ke raashtra-geet ko rachane kaa kaam sheeghra hi puraa karnaa chahie
 His advice cars suggested him the names of many famous Urdu poets who could have composed the song
 lekin jinnah kii soch kuch ore hi thi
 He felt that this is a good chance to establish the secular image of Pakistan before the world
 isliye unhone lahore ke mahanaurdu shaayar or mul hindu jagannatha azaad ko kaha ki "main aapako paanch din kaa hi samay de saktaa hu, aap pakistan ke liye raashtra-geet likhen"
 Jagannath Azad was also surprised and happy
 lekin pakistan ke kattarpanthi netaa isse bahut naaraaz hue ki ek hindu pakistan kaa raashtra-geet likhegaa
 But they were helpless before Jinnah's wish
 akhirkaar jagannatha azaad ne paanch dinon ke andar raashtra-geet taiyaar kar liya jo jinnah ko bahut pasand aayaa
 The lyrics were - i sarazami e pakjarre tere hai ajasitaro se tabanakaroshan he kehkashan se kahinaj teri khaak Jinnah recognized it as a national song and the song remained a national song till his death
 lekin is geet kii sweekruti ke mahaz 18 maheene baad hi jinnah kaa dehanth ho gaya or unke saath hi raashtra-geet kii manyata bhi khatm kar di gai
 Jagannath Azad later moved to India
 jinnah kii mrityu ke baad pakistan sarkaar ne ek raashtra-geet cameti banaai
 And asked for song samples from well-known poets
 lekin koi bhi geet raashtra-geet ke laayak nahi ban paa rahaa tha
 Finally, the government of Pakistan recognized the tune composed by Ahmed Chagla in 1950 as a national tune
 usee samay iran ke shah pakistan kii yatra par aae or unhone dhun ko kaaphi pasand kiya
 This tune seemed more westernized, but the rashtra-geet Committee believed that its form would be more accepted in Western society

 The song was liked by the members of the rashtra-geet Committee
