 At one time there was a fierce war on both sides
 anek varshon tak wo yuddh chalaa
 In that battle, the demons of the gods were defeated

 But once a quarrel arose between Aditi and Kashyap
 krodh main kashyap aditi ke garbhasth shishu ko “mrit” shabd se sambodhit kar baithe
 At the same time, a light came out from Aditi's womb
 us prakashpunj ko dekhakar kashyap bhaybheet ho gayi
 Kashyap apologized to Surya
 tab hi akashwani hui ki – “aap donon is puddj kaa pratidin pujan karen
 As soon as the time is right, a son will be born from that mass

 indra ne chhalpurvak diti ke garbh ke saat bhaag kar diye
 While this baby was crying, Indra said - "ma Rudantu"
 tat pashchaat punah prayek garbh ke saat vibhaag kiye
 Thus forty-nine sons were born
 wein putr marudgan kahe jate hai, jo ki unchaas hai
 Enraged by Indra's indecent act, Diti curses Aditi that - "the kingdom of Indra will soon be destroyed
" jaisaa aditi ne mere garbh ko giraaya, vaise hi uskaa bhi putr janm samay main hi nasht ho jayega”
 With the effect of the curse, in the Dwaparyuga, the Kashyapa sage was born as Vasudeva, Aditi was born as Devaki and Diti was born as Rohini
 devaki ke saat putron kii karagaar main kansa ne hatya kar di

 In the end, Dev was defeated

 His mother Aditi was also saddened by the grief of her sons
 us samay kashyap rishi van main tapasya kar rahe the
 When his tenacity was complete, Aditi narrated the condition of the Devas
 devon ke kalyaan ke liye upaay bhi unh se poocha
 Kashyapa Rishi told the remedy of devotion to Vishnu in the past
 aditi dwaara payovrat purvak bhagavan vishnu kii upasna kii gai
 Lord Vishnu was pleased after a few days
 bhagavan vishnu prakat ho kar bole ki – “he devi ! aapane shraddha purvak meri upasna kii he
 Therefore, "I will incarnate from your womb
 vah meraa vaaman avatar hoga
 i will destroy the demons and protect the gods ”I give you the boon
 kashyap rishi bhavishyadarshi the
 Therefore, he was already in the forefront that - "vishnu will wear the Vamana avatar from the womb of Aditi"
 tatpashchaat wein apane tej se aditi ke garbh main pravesh kar gayi
 Over time, Vamana incarnation of Lord Vishnu took place

 tritv isai dharm kaa kendriya tathaa guautam dharmasiddhant ishwar ke abhyantar swaroop se sambandhit he jise trinity arthath tritv kehete hai
 Tritva means that there are three persons in the same God - Father, Son and Holy Spirit
 ye teenon samaan rup se anadi, anant or sarvashaktiman hai kyonki tark ke bal par maanav buddhi keval ek sarvashaktiman srishtikarta ishwar ke astitv tak pahunch sakati he
 In fact, the doctrine of the Trinity is believed to be the reason that Jesus taught him
 bible ke purvardh se pataa chalata he ki yahudee dharm main akeshwarwad par vishesh bal diya gaya tha
 In the latter part of the Bible, Jesus maintains that monotheism and teaches that i and God the Father are one
 iske atirikt vah apane shishyon se kehete hai ki main pavitra aatma ko bhej doongaa ja avyakt rup se tum logon ke saath rahegaa
 He also considers that holy spirit in harmony with divine qualities

 The three are essentially one
 at: teenon kii ek hi sankalpaikti tathaa ek hi buddhi he
 Yet there is a mutual difference between Father, Son and Holy Spirit
 pita kisi se utpann nahin hota
 The son from time immemorial assumes full divinity from the father
 putr kii is utpatti ko prajnan kehete hai
 The origin of the Holy Spirit is called fertility
 pavitra aatma kii utpatti pita tathaa putr donon se maani jaati he or prasaran kehalaati he
 The reproduction of the son and diffusion with the Holy Spirit creates a mutual difference of the three persons, but essentially all three are one and are equally aligned with all divine qualities
 
 This theology has been pondered for centuries and many conceptions of the element have been misled
 tridevathawaad, jo teen bhinn ishwariya tatv maanata he spashtatya bhraamak he, kyonki is prakaar teen swatantra devataaon kaa astitv sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Modalism, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are the three aspects of the same God that arise due to creation - the Father is the Creator, the Son saves us and the Holy Spirit sanctifies us
 carch ne is vaad ko teesri tathaa chauthi shatabdi main thukrakar yah bataaya ki sristi se pehle hi ishwar main teen vyakti vidyan the
 The World Assembly of Nisea has held all interpretations of the Trinity to be misleading according to which the son or the Holy Spirit is considered secondary to the father

 Land acquisition can be defined as an activity of the government by which it acquires land from landowners, so that it can be used for any public purpose or for a company
 yah adhigrahan swaamiyon ko muaavze ke bhugtan yaa bhoomi main ruchi rakhane vaale vyaktiyon ke bhugtan ke adheen hota he
 The acquisition of land by the government is not usually of a compulsory type, nor is it done without taking into account the reluctant owner of land sharing
 sampatti kii maang or adhigrahan samavarti suchi main aata he, jiskaa arth he kendra or rajya sarkarein is maamle main kanoon bana sakati hai
 There are several local and specific laws which provide for the acquisition of land under them but the main law relating to the acquisition of land is the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
 yah adhinium sarkaar ko saarvajanik prayojanon ke liye bhoomi ke adhigrahan kaa praadhikaran pradaan karata he jaise ki yojanabaddh vikaas, shahar yaa gramin yojana ke liye praavdhaan, garibon yaa bhoomihinon ke liye awasaiya prayojan hetu praavdhaan yaa kisi shiksha, awaas yaa swasthya yojana ke liye sarkaar ko bhoomi kii aavashyaktaa
 This hinders the acquisition of land at a reasonable price, which has an adverse effect on cost

 By applying it, it is said that the expressed land consists of the benefits which arise from the land and the objects which are attached to the soil or are permanently attached to the soil
 iske alaava yadi liye gaye muaavze ko kisi virodh ke tahat diya gaya he, bajaae iske ki ise praapt karne vaale ko iske prabhavi hone ke anusaar paane kii paatrata he, to maamle ko muaavze kii apekshit raashi ke nirdhaaran hetu nyaayalay main bheja jaataa he
 The Ministry of Rural Development being the nodal Union Government to administer the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, processes proposals for amendment of various provisions of the said Act from time to time
 pun: is adhinium main saarvajanik prastaavon ko bhi vinirdisht kiya jaataa he jo rajya kii ore se bhoomi ke is adhigrahan ke liye praadhikrut hai
 This includes the Collector, Deputy Commissioner and any other officers who are specially appointed by the appropriate government under the authority of law

 is prabhag dwaara samavarti hone ke prayojan hetu bhoomi adhigrahan adhinium, 1894 main sanshodhan ke liye rajya sarkaron ke sabhi prastaavon kii jaanch bhi kii jaati he, jaisaa ki samvidhan kii dhara 254 kii upadhara ke adheen aavashyak he

 firoz shah tululaq dilli sultanate main tululaq vansh kaa shaasha tha
 Ferozeshah Tughlaq was born on 1309
 wo bharat par antim muslim shaasha tha
 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule
 usne apane shasankaal main hi chaandi ke sikke chalaaye| firozshah tululaq, mohammad tululaq kaa chachera bhai evam sipahsalaar 'rajab' kaa putr tha
 His mother 'bibi Jaizella' was the daughter of Rajput chieftain Rajamal
 mohammad tululaq kii mutyu ke baad 20 march 1351 ko firoz tululaq kaa rajbhishak thatta ke nikat hua
 Feroze was crowned again in Delhi in August, 1351
 sultan banane ke baad firozshah tululaq ne sabhi qarze maaf kar die, jisamen 'sondhar rin' bhi shaamil tha, jo mohammad tululaq ke samay kisaanon ko diya gaya tha
 After becoming Sultan, Feroze Tughlaq invaded Bengal and Sindh as part of his campaign to conquer his territories separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal ko jeetne ke liye sultan ne 1353 i
 main akraman kiya
 At that time, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was the ruler of that place
 usne ikdala ke qile main sharan le rakhi thi, sultan firoz antatah qile par adhikaar karne main asafal hokar 1355 i
 main waapas dilli aa gaya
 Again in 1359 AD, Firuz Tughlaq attacked Sikandar Shah, the son of the then ruler Shamsuddin, in an attempt to take control of Bengal, but failed once again
 1360 i main sultan firoz ne ‘jajanagar’ par akraman karke vahaan ke shaasha bhanudev tritiy ko parrast kar puri ke jagannatha mandir puri ko dhwast kiya

 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire
 rajasav vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne apane shashan kaal main 24 kshtdaayak karon ko samaapt kar diya or keval 4 kar ‘karaaj’, ‘khums’, ‘jazia’, evam 'zakaat' ko vasuul karne kaa aadesh diya
 On the orders of the Ulama, the Sultan also imposed a new irrigation tax, which charged 1 / 10 of the produce
 sambhavtah firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal main lagaan upaj kaa 1 / 5 se 1 / 3 bhaag hota tha
 To facilitate irrigation, the Sultan built 5 big canals from the Yamuna River to Hisar, 150 miles long from the Sutlej River to the Ghaggar River, from the hill of Sirmour to the Hansi, from Ghaggar to Firozabad and from Yamuna to Firozabad
 usne falo ke lagbhag 1200 baag lagavaaye
 Abolished many taxes to increase internal trade
 nagar evam saarvajanik nirmaan kaaryon ke antargat sultan ne lagbhag 300 naye nagaron kii sthapana kii
 Among these, Hisar, Firozabad, Fatehabad, Jaunpur, Firozpur etc

 megna carta main england ke raja jon ne samanton ko kuch adhikaar diye; kuch kanoonee prakriyaaon ke paalan kaa vachan diya; or sweekaar kiya ki unki ichha kanoon ke seemaa main bandhi rahegi
 Magna Carta unequivocally affirmed the king's defense of certain rights of the subjects, of which the Bandi Habitat petition is notable

 On his return to England, a consortium of barons placed before him a list of demands

 iske antargat ek vot se dalit apana pratinidhi chun sakate the va duusari vot se saamaanya varg kaa pratinidhi chunane kii aazaadee thi
 Thus the Dalit representative was to be elected only by the vote of the Dalits
 is praavdhaan se ab dalit pratinidhi ko chunane main saamaanya varg kaa koi dakhal shesh nahin rahaa tha
 But at the same time, the Dalit class could play its role by using its second vote, choosing the representative of the general class

 But when he felt that his demand was not being implemented, he announced to observe a death fast
 tabhi ambedkar ne kaha ki "yadi gandhi desh kii swatantraaa ke liye yah vrath rakhata to acha hota, lekin unhone dalit logon ke virodh main yah vrath rakhaa he, jo behad afsosjanak he
 Whereas, there was no objection from Gandhi about this right given to Indian Christians, Muslims and Sikhs
 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki gandhi koi amar vyakti nahin hai
 How many such people were born in India and went away
 ambedkar ne kaha ki gandhi kii jaan bachaane ke liye vah daliton ke hiton kaa tyaag nahin kar sakate
 Now Gandhi's health was continuously deteriorating due to the death fast
 gandhi ke praanon par baari sankat aan padaa
 And the entire Hindu society became anti-ambedkar
 desh main badhate dabaav ko dekh ambedkar 24 sitambar 1932 ko shaam paanch baje yeravada jail pahunche

 But with this, instead of 78 reserved seats from the Communal Award, the number of reserved seats in Poona Pact was increased to 148

 vidwaan venkat dhalipal ne kaha ki thots on pakistan ne "ek dashak tak bhartiya raajnneeti ko roka"
 It set the course of dialogue between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for the partition of India

 unhone poocha ki kya pakistan kii sthapana ke liye paryaapt kaaran maujuud the? or suzav diya ki hindu or musalamaanon ke bich ke matbhed ek kam kathor kadam se bhi mitaanaa sambhav ho saktaa tha
 He has written that Pakistan should justify its existence

 Baba Saheb Ambedkar made many efforts to improve Hindu religion and Hindu society, to achieve equality and respect, while being under Hindu religion for 10-12 years, but the heart of the upper caste Hindus did not change
 ulte unhen nindit kiya gaya or hindu dharm vinaashak tak kaha gaya
 After that he said that, "we made every effort and satyagraha to achieve the level of equality in Hindu society, but all proved fruitless
 hindu samaaj main samanta ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 "hindu society used to say that" humans are for religion "while Ambedkar believed that" religions are for humans
