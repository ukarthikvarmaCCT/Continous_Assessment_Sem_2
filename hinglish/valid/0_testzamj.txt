 Around the middle of the 19th century, the foundation of mechanical seismology was laid, seismometers were built, and nets of observatories were laid for earthquake recording

 In 1892, John Milan developed a surface seismometer in collaboration with Knott, Youig, and Gray in Japan, and since then seismometers have been used to collect real mechanical data from many parts of the world

 In 1905, the Omori Uyig earthquakemeter arrived at the observatories of Shimla, Bombay and Calcutta
 iske baad anyaanya bukampamapiyon kaa upyog anek vedhashalaon main prarambh hua
 a mechanical seismometer consists of a horizontal or vertical pendulum, mounted on an inclined shell, or located deep enough in the earth, to be available
 kaanpati prithvi ke kaaran lolak main utpann companon ko upyukt yukti se pravardhit or abhilikhit kiya jaataa he
 The pendulum is often revolutionized to filter out unwanted oscillations
 jaisaa upar spasht kiya ja chukaa he, kuch bukampalekhiyon ko bukampamapi ke rup main or kuch ko twaranmaapi ke rup main abhikalpit kiya jaataa he
 Milan Shaw and Wood Andersen are major instruments in mechanical seismographs and are used in many observatories in India and abroad

 Apart from these, there are many types of seismometers, which are small, portable and usually designed with suitable damping etc
 according to the electromagnetic theory and nowadays are used in recording seismic waves generated by humanized explosions in seismic prospecting of oil etc
 bukampamapiyon kaa abhikalpan vibhinn prakaar kii bukamp tarangon, pra, praathmik, gau, gaun tathaa prishth tarang aadi kaa abhilekhan karne ke liye hota he, jo bukamp ke strot se is prakaar prasarjit hoti he ki koi bhi unki vibhinn pravasthaon ke antar ko abhilekh se jaan saktaa he
 This is very important from the point of view of studying the distance and depth of focus of the epicenter of the earthquake

 Similarly, the study of the records of local earthquakes provides useful information about the earth's crust and the earth's interconnection with distant earthquakes

 Today, when seismology has developed into earthquake engineering and earthquake survey, the importance of seismometers cannot be overstated except for the study of earthquakes and micro-earthquakes

 wo vahaan kii milakiyaat par qaabiz va dakheel huye or bagair kisi duusare kii shirkat ke apni aulad ke qabze va tasarruf main choda
 Patakpur was a curia at that time
 us vaqt hindustaan main behalol lodi barasare hukumat tha or puraa naqvi khandaan nasirabad main balaaye qalaa rihaaish pazir tha

 At the same time, he achieved all kinds of training
 jiske baad wo pathaanon main qaabil samajha jane laga
 Finally, he met Daulat Khan
 daulat khan ibrahim lodi kaa khaas aadmi tha
 This is the period when Babur attacked India
 or us hamale main ibrahim lodi maaraa gaya or babar hindustaan ke takht par baitha
 At that time Muhammad Khan was the Sultan
 chunki farid ne apni talwaar se sher ko maaraa tha

 Sher Shah died in 1548
 jiske baad san 1555 main suri khandaan kii hukumat khatm ho gayi
 Humayun conquered and conquered India again in 1555 and achieved the rule of Delhi
 chunki nasirabad ke naqvi khandaan ne san 1540 kii jang main uske kilaaf shershah kaa saath diya tha
 That is why Humayun tightened up there
 manikpur ke kade ke rahane vaale mahmud qatbi ko nasirabad kaa qaazi muqarrar kiya gaya
 Who came to Nasirabad and started staying in Mohalla Ahle Dayal
 jise baad main humayun ne alag kar diya
 Due to the fear of Humayun, the people of Naqvi Khanadan of Nasirabad withdrew and became angry

 Some of whom went here in search of employment
 jo aaj bhi amroha, baaraha va sambhal vagairah main maujuud hai

 Sayyid Mahmud Qatbi told the people of Naqvi Khanadan of Nupirabad, who had become angry, to be conditioned
 naqvi saadaat dobaaraa palatakar nasirabad aaye or rihaaish ikhteyaar kii

 sristi ke aavirbhaav se hi vah swayan kii ant:prerana se parivartanon kaa adhyayan karata rahaa he- parivartan jo gun vyavhaar kii reeti ityadi main aaye hai- jo prakritik vigyaan ke vikaas kaa kaarak bana
 Probably because of this inner inspiration, Maharishi Kanad started the 'vaishika Darshan'
 maharishi kanad ne bhautik raashiyon ko dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh or samavaay ke rup main namankit kiya he
 Here 'matter' includes solids, 'soul' and 'mind' in terms of solids, liquids, energy, gas, plasma, time and mainly vector length
 prakrut prasang main vaisheshik darshan kaa adhikarpurvak kathan he ki uparyukt dravyon main pratham chaar sristi ke pratyaksh kaarak hai, or akaash, dik or kaal, sanathan or sarvyaapt hai
 The Vaisesika philosophy considers 'soul' and 'mind' respectively to be the factors of sense knowledge and experience, that is, 'soul' is the observer and 'mind' is its tool to experience
 is hetu padaarthmay sansar kii bhautik raashiyon kii seemaa se bahishkrut rahane par bhi, vaisheshik darshan dwaara 'aatma' or 'man' ko bhautik raashiyon main sammilit karnaa nyaay sangat prathit hota he, kyonki ye tatv prekshan or anubhav ke liye nitant aavashyak hai
 However, according to modern physics, in addition to the 'soul' and 'mind', a comparative study will be carried out with their models mentioned in physics, while discussing the first seven elements of Vaishyas from 'earth' to 'pain'
 bhautikee ke anusaar 'padaarth' ko bhautik raashi ke samatuly mana ja saktaa he, jab ki vaisheshik manyatanusaar padaarth main 'bhoot' or aadhibhautik se sambandhit rashiyaan sammilit hoti hai, jahaan 'bhoot' bhautik indriyon dwaara grahya he
 Currently, you can define the physical zodiac in the following way - ghost specific knowledge is called physical substance
 arthath ise bhoot isse sambandhit vishisht gyaan, athwa ubhay rup main seemaabaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 Again, ghosts are defined by knowing knowledge related to interview; the associative relation of the interview and even the senses
 uparyukt paribhaasha main 'vishisht gyaan' kaa arth he- iskaa aadhaar, iskaa sahagaami kaarak se sanyog or iskaa aadhaar ke atirikt anya se sambandh
 For this, solid, fluid, energy, gas and plasma are 'ghosts' or substances of different states, as they are directly perceptible by externals such as nose, ooze, eyes, skin and ears
 athwa yah kah sakate hai ki indriyon se grahya vishesh gunavan padaarth bhautik padaarth hai
 These physical substances have a co-operative relationship with the pain and time
 'gun' karm, saamaanya, vishesh, samavaay ke saath anubhav karne yogya sambandh rakhte hai
 Whether the soul and the mind, which have a co-operative relationship with the ghosts, should be included in the material zodiac or mentioned separately as half-physical zodiacs
 This does not affect the ideology of Vaishika philosophy related to physical zodiac signs
 
 kanad ne bhautik raashiyon ko chha: virgon yaa 6 moolbhoot amoort raashiyon main nibaddh kiya he
