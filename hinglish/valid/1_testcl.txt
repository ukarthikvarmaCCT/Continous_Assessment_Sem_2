 There is very little time for sleep in this life filled with running time
 lekin agar us mili samay main bhi neend naa aae to bahut bura hota he
 Let us know that the things you should not eat when you feel light hungry at night
 inhen khaane se aapaki neend kharaab ho sakati he
 If you often feel hungry again before going to sleep at night, then you should not forget to eat these 8 things because it can not only spoil your sleep but also harm your health
 raat ke samay junk food khaakar, chaiyn kii neend so paanaa thodaa mushkil he
 If a little portion of pizza is left in the fridge, your hand can move towards the fridge
 lekin sone se pehle pizza khaane se naa keval vajan badhegaa balki heart bern jaisi samasyaayein bhi ho sakati he
 Junk food contains saturated fat which takes a long time to digest
 chikan yaa kisi bhi tarah kii protein vaali cheez raat main nahin khaani chahie
 Digestibility slows down to 50 percent at bedtime
 zyada protein lene par sone par dhyaan kendrit karne ke bajaae, aapaki body pachan par dhyaan dene lagati he
 Taking carbohydrates with protein can restore balance
 raat ko bhukh lage to sabase badhiya snacks najar aata he chips
 The entire packet of chips is over in two minutes and eradicates hunger easily
 lekin yah khaane main jitna aasaan dikhataa he, pachaane main utana hi mushkil
 In fact, processed foods contain high amounts of monosodium glutamate, which can cause insomnia
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki subjiyon main bahut poshak tatv hote hai isliye aap soch sakate hai ki sone se pehle subjiyan khaane main koi harj nahin he
 But the truth is something else
 subjiyon main kaaphi maatra main fibre maujuud hota he jo aapke pachan tantra ko behad sust bana detaa he
 This allows you to stay awake till late at night
 kai logon ko ehsaas hi nahin hota he ki chocolate caffeine kaa strot he
 If there is nothing left to eat in your house, then only eat chocolate at night
 agar aap sone se pehle coffee lene se batch rahe hai to usee tarah aapako chocolate se bhi duuri bana leni chahie
 Can't sleep again after breaking? This alcohol is very dangerous for sleep
 isse raat main aapaki neend kai baar tuutati he or agle din kaam karne ke liye jaruri acchhee neend bhi aapako nahin mil paati he
 What to say if you have ice cream in the fridge and feel hungry at night
 lekin raat main icecream khaanaa bhi behad nuksaandeh he
 Ice cream contains large amounts of both fat and sugar
 sone se pehle icecream khaane kaa sidhaa matlab he ki aap apana vajan badhaane ja rahe hai
 Caffeine has a direct effect on our brain
 caffeine kii maatra vaali kisi bhi cheez ko khaane yaa pine se neend par asar padataa he
 The effect of caffeine lasts for five hours after taking it
 badalte mausam main aise rakhen chehre kaa khyalrat ke samay bahut spisi khaanaa khaanaa sahi nahin he
 Eating too spicy food causes burning and gas problems, which leads to poor sleep
 fruits main natural sugar hone kii vajah se inhen diaguest hone main vakt lagata he
 Therefore, avoid eating fruits at night

 ' haalanki, galati se usne 1971 ke yuddh ko 1965 kaa bharat-paak yuddh bataate hue kaha, 'main aashaa karata hum ki aapako yaad hoga jab aap apana aadha desh bharat ke haathon ganvaa baithe the
 
 
 This country told you that you are welcome at home and you deliberately forgot your war crimes
 ' vah 2012 main pakistani jail se bhaag gaya tha
 Rashid said, 'you will remember when thousands of Pakistani youths fought a proxy war in Afghanistan and Indian Kashmir
 
 
 
 He then asked what the Pakistan Army gave in return
 sivaay aapke hajaaron balooch bhaaiyon kii hatya karne ke
 Rashid said that after this you fell into the game of dollars and you earned millions of dollars from the proxy war in Afghanistan
 par, aapane jihad ke naam par raashtra ko dhokhaa diya
 Muslims have not forgotten the bloody game you played in Indian Kashmir where you exploited the youth in the name of so-called independence

 haalanki abhi customer or border prodection ne yah bhi kaha he ki wo un logon ko america main ghusane se nahin rokenge jinpar soshal media acount na hon yaa wo dena nahin chaahate

 maanavadhikaar or tech companiyon ke sadasyon ne isapar june main hi chintaa jataai thi jab ise pehle propose kiya gaya tha
 In addition, the Internet Association, an industry lobbying group representing companies such as Facebook and Google, has backed the ACLU (american Civil Liberation Union), upholding the proposal

 These groups fear that due to the social media information of the people it may be misused

 Directorate General of Civil Aviation DGCA found that 130 pilots and 430 crew members of Air India were allegedly evading compulsory alcohol testing before and after the flight, so these pilots and crew members could be removed from duty
 sutron ne bataaya ki ye kru sadsy singapore, kuwait, bangkok, ahmedabad or goa jaisi jagahon kii udaanon main kaaphi samay tak niyamit taur par alcohol jaanch se bachate rahe hai
 He said that DGCA has already given a final warning to Air India management regarding alleged violation of safety standards by crew members
 dijisie ke suraksha maanakon ke anusaar, udaan se pehle sabhi kru sadasyon or payalton kaa alcohol jaanch se guzarana anivaary he
 Air India responded to this by stating that it has been fully adhering to the provisions of DGCA and will continue to follow all the guidelines of the regulator
 ise bhi padhein: kitaab ke sahare phir rajan kii do took, 'vaade kam kaam adhik' kii jaruratair india ne bayaan jari kar kaha, ham dijisie ke saath kaam kar rahe hai or dijisie ke sabhi dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karenge
 a source said, DGCA has brought to the notice of Air India management that 132 of its pilots and 434 crew members have violated the mandatory alcohol check
 ise bhi padhein: mid de mile nahin, kuposhan mukt bharat hogi niti ayog kii nai yojanayah suraksha maanakon kaa ulanghan he or dijisie is babat in kru sadasyon ke khilaaf aavashyak kadam uthegi
 With so many crew members not being able to remove so many pilots and crew members at once, this could cause operational problems, so DGCA will probably take steps against the accused pilot and crew member in a phased manner

 Shortly before this, the Delhi government has issued rules regarding nursery admission in private schools
 isamen kaha gaya he ki 1400 gaiyr-sahaayta praapt privet skulon main admician prakriya 2 janvari 2017 se shuru hogi
 At the same time, rules and schedules for the 285 schools built on the land of DDA will be set separately and will be released soon
 nursery daakhile main 'skool se duuri' ko milenge sarvaadhik pointrub in 285 skulon main se kuch ne doe ke in nirdeshon kaa intjaar kiye bina hi admician shedul jari kar diya he
 This move of schools has led to increased confusions among parents
 in skulon ne apni guideline main skool se duuri ko ahmiyat di he
 Although how many numbers will be given to a distance, the scale is different
 kuch ne girl child to kuch ne single parent ke liye bhi marks rakhe hai
 At the same time, there is also a provision of marks for children of sibling, ward or staff
 23 janvari tak jamaa kar sakate hai nursery admician ke formbata den ki doe ne 19 disambar ko dilli ke privet skulon main nursery admician ko lekar kuch guidelins jari kii thim
 According to them, the admission process has to start from January 2 and the criterion of admission will have to be uploaded online to all schools
 lekin 285 skulon ke liye alag se guidelins jari karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 Private schools give admission to children living under the purview of 1 KM: The Sisodiatab Directorate of Education had said that these schools built on DDA land will have to be given admission only on the basis of distance criterion
 ol india shiya personal lau board 'teen talaak' par pratibandh lagane ke liye supreme court jayega
 This decision was taken in a board meeting held in Lucknow
 board ne sarkaar ko khat likh kar maang kii he ki vah kanoon bana kar 'sati pratha' kii tarah 'teen talaak' ko bhi bain kare kyonki ye mahila virdohi he, prakritik nyaay or samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 At the Shia Personal Law Board meeting held in Lucknow, there was a general opinion that a campaign should be launched against triple talaq
 supreme court main teen talaak ke khilaaf pehle se chal rahe cese main board intervension pitishan daakhil kar ise pratibandhit karne kii maang karegaa
 Members of the board gave several arguments for this
 misaal ke taur par, quran main teen talaak nahin he, phir yahaan kyon lagu he? quran main mard-aurat ko baraabar kaha gaya he or muslim shaadi ek anubandh he
 Then why don't both have equal rights in this contract? Shia do not consider triple talaq
 kya ve muslim nahin hai? kai muslim deshon main yah bain he
 Why not here again? Men and women are equal in the constitution of the country
 phir ye samvidhan virdohi chalan kaise lagu he? yah ekatarfa or prakritik nyaay ke khilaaf he
 Then how is it implemented? shiya personal lau board ke pravaktaa moulana yasuub abbaas kehete hai, 'is desh main daal main namak zyada hone, khaanaa kharaab banane, shuhar ke dost se hanskar baat kar lene par bhi mard teen talaak kah ke talaak de de rahe hai
 There is no hearing of the woman in this, so the way the government had enacted a law to ban the practice of Sati, the same should be made and banned
 ' Three divorces are prevalent among Sunni Muslims in the country
 iske tahat shuhar, bivi ko bina vajah bataae, bina kisi ittela ke teen baar talaak kahkar talaak de saktaa he
 According to Ulema, among the ways a divorce occurs, a drunk divorce, an angry divorce, a dreamed divorce, a divorce from a servant called a wife, skype, email, letter, SMS, whatsapp, Twitter, Includes Facebook Messenger and a phone call
 is desh ke kanoon main daftar se chaparasi ko bhi nikaalane se pehle usko sunwaayee kaa mauka dena jaruri he
 But Muslim wife can be removed from life without giving any reason
 jahaan mard ko bina vajah bhi talaak kaa adhikaar diya ja rahaa he, vahiin agar shuhar mahila par julm jyaadati kare to bhi use apane pati ko talaak dene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The comments mahila adhikaron ke liye kaam karne vaali varisht patrkaar shahira naeem kahati hai ki 'agar aurat kii hami shaadi main honi jaruri he to uski hami talaak main bhi honi chahie
 He should also have the right to exit a relationship

 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board then filed an intervention petition saying that the court had no right to interfere in personal law

 The court has asked the government to file an answer in this matter
 lakhanu main hui shiya personal lau board kii baithak main aam raay thi ki teen talaak ke khilaaf muhim chalaai jaae
 In the Supreme Court in an already ongoing case against triple talaq, the Board will seek to ban it by filing Intervention Petition
 board ke sadasyon ne iske liye kai tark die
 For example, the Quran does not have three divorces, then why is it applicable here? The Quran mentions masculine and Muslim marriage is a contract
 phir is anubandh main donon ko baraabar adhikaar kyon nahin? shiya teen talaak nahin maanate
 Are they not muslim? This is banned in many Muslim countries
 phir yahaan kyon nahin? desh ke samvidhan main mard-aurat baraabar hai
 Then how is this anti-constitutional practice applicable? It is unilateral and against natural justice
 phir kaise lagu he? Maulana Yasub Abbas, spokesperson of the Shia Personal Law Board, says, "in this country, men are divorcing them by saying triple talaq, even after the salt in the lentils, the food is spoiled, and after talking to the friend of the husband
 isamen aurat kii koi sunwaayee nahin he, isliye sarkaar ne jis tarah sati pratha ko pratibandhit karne ke liye kanoon banaaya tha, usee tarah ise bhi kanoon banaakar pratibandhit kare

 gaanv jaisaa kya bachaa tha ki gudgaanv ke gudgaanv nahin rahane par kai log bhavuk ho rahe hai
 Gurgaon is not only Gurgaon, there are malls, super malls, hotels, apartments all there
 vahaan agar kuch nahin tha to gaanv hi nahin tha
 But instead of village, village came
 shaharon par daavedaari hamaare gaanv itani aasaani se nahin chhodane vaale
 As many smart cities as you can by taking the land of villages, at least the names should be copyrighted by the village itself
 hamaare sahyogi parimal ne vahaan jaakar dekha ki aaj bhi log gudgaanv village ke naam se ji rahe hai
 The village as well as the village
 hindi angreji kaa dabl yuj or sashastitv kahaan milegaa aapako
 But now even the village has gone and the village too
 gud to gaya hi
 The Haryana government has renamed Gurgaon as Gurugram
 kisi hindi adhikari ko dekhnaa chahie ki kahin ye log gurugram village na likhane lagen
 After the compensation is over, you have to be extra sensitive to understand the identity of your identity
 kuch bhi mila ho magar baap daadon ke daur ke naam or yaaden pareshaan to karti hi hongi
 Like people trapped in the name of settling in these apartments must remember their village
 parimal ko gudgaanv village ke nivaasiyon ne bataaya ki ve kaaphi khush hai kyonki bacchon ko itihaas kaa pataa rahegaa
 i wish someone would preserve history even for the elders, due to which there is so much quarrel over history
 kya sarkaar is gaanv kaa naam gurugram rakhkar manoranjak vivaad se batch sakati thi
 The rest of the city would have been called Gurgaon
 manoranjak vivaad isliye kaha ki twitor or fasebuk par gurugram ko lekar khub ha ha hi hi ho rahi he
 In this affair, people have forgotten about Mewat's name being Nuh
 rishi kapur ko nunh ke saath hunh kii tukbandi kaa khyaal aayaa he
 Whatever it is, Gurgaon is no more Gurgaon
 use gurugram hona hi hoga
 It is also written on the site of the Deputy Commissioner of Gurgaon that the name of the district comes from the name of Guru Dronacharya
 pandavon main sabase bade yuddhishthir ne gurudakshina ke taur par dronacharya ko ek gaanv daan main diya tha
 Hence it was named Guru Gram which later became Gurgaon
 yah zila mahabharat ke samay se maujuud he
 It is being talked about the identity of a village, it has been written in the Gazette that this district is from the time of Mahabharata
 kya us vakt zila hota bhi tha to lage haath pehle mahabharat kaal ke colector kaa naam bhi likh dete
 Well, it is written in the gazette of the district that on the west side of the railway road there was a pond of Dronacharya which is still today
 gudgaanv shahar se asli gudgaanv dedh kimi dur he jahaan sheetala mata kaa mandir he
 The temple of Sheetla Mata is a very famous place
 yahaan bihar se aae badi sankhya main log chhath puja bhi karte hai
 It is written in the Gazette of Gurgaon that the real Gurgaon is one and a half km from the city of Gurgaon
 phir puure gudgaanv kaa naam kyon badla gaya
 Was the expansion of Gurgaon just on the land of the original Guru Gram or did the expansion of Gurgaon take over the land and existence of many villages
 gudgaanv ke bhi bacchon kii tarah pukaar ke kai naam hai
 Sometimes Cyber city, sometimes Millennium City and sometimes Gurgaon
 aap jis gudgaanv zile ko jaanate hai uske loksabhaa kshetra main 9 vidhansabhaayen aati hai
 There are 246 villages across the district
 gudgaanv kaa zyaadaatar vistaar gudgaanv vidhansabha or badshahpur vidhansabha ke gaanvon kii zamin par hua he
 One part of DLF comes in Badshahpur Assembly and one part in Gurgaon Assembly
 gudgaanv vidhansabha main gudgaanv ke alaava paanch or gaanv aate hai jinke naam hai, wazirabad, chakarpur, sukhrali, canahai silokada
 The Gurgaon Legislative Assembly is considered urban, with a voting percentage of 69 in the previous assembly
 2 pratishat tha
 Even then, the condition of the facilities in Gurgaon seems to be crispy
 aadhunik bharat main naam badalane par pracheen bharat ke itihaas or mithkon kii kaaphi chalati he
 It was told that the people of Agra and Delhi should not claim Gurgaon, while there is information on the district's website that during the time of Akbar this suba used to come in Delhi and Agra
 khayr ab to akbar bhi great nahin rahe to gudgaanv kya rahegaa
 Why are people so emotional? pehle bhi kitni baar naam badale hai
 Calcutta was Kolkata before our eyes
 bombai bhi hamaari ankhon ke saamne mumbai ho gaya
 When Bangalore became Bangalore, we fought a lot with small u and big U
 upi main kuch zile hai jinke naam mayawati ke aane par badal jate hai or jane par phir badal jate hai
 Like before Amethi was kept as Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharajnagar, then it became Amethi
 zaruri nahin ki kisi jagah kaa prachlit naam badalane ke liye vahaan koi us naam kaa gaanv ho hi yaa koi vahaan kaa ho
 Whatever happens in power, they can do anything
 upi ke shamali ko prabud nagar kar diya gaya tha
 Initially there is a ruckus when the names are changed, but soon people settle down
 gudgaanv vaale bhi kar hi jaaenge
 When Millennium City was called, he was not sentimental about Gurgaon
 ab guru gram ko lekar kyon hone lage hai
 What was the benefit of doing Guru Gram? kya vaaki isse itihaas kii vaapasi ho jaati he
 If the name does not change, so much can be done about Gurgaon also
 hamaari janata vaaki creative he
 There is a rapid metro rail line in this Gurgaon
 iske steshnon kaa naam sunakar to yahaan ke logon kii jubaan bhi ladkadaa jaati hogi
 Will all these names be erased after becoming Guru Gram
 phej thri stesan, micromax maulasari avenu, inds ind bank sibar city, vodaphone belwadier tower, fez tu
 The names of the stations have also become like shops
 praayojak ko bhi stesan mil saktaa he
 Do you know the city tomorrow and Vodafone Guru Village
 phir log kanphyus ho jaaenge ki guru dron kaa gurudakshina main gaanv vodaphone ne diya tha yaa pandavon ne
 By the way, there is another line of metro which is called Yellow Line
 jo dilli ke jahangirpuri se shuru hokar gudgaanv ke huda city centre tak jaati he
 If you come from Delhi, after Arjan Garh, there is a station named Guru Dronacharya Metro Station
 yahaan par 1955 se ek college bhi he jiskaa naam guru dronacharya ejineering college he
 Among the gurus, the place of this college named after Guru Dronacharya should have been higher than the IIT
 yahaan bane dronacharya mandir se prerana paakar in guruon ne ek se ek arjuna paidaa kiye honge
 Whatever it is, it shows that these names exist in the local tradition
 par kya jab pandavon ne is gaanv ko daan main diya hoga to guru gram hi naam hoga yaa kuch or naam rahaa hoga
 If the original is to be known, the name of the village which was donated should be traced
 guru gram ko lekar twitor par tukbandiya chal rahi hai
 Instagram, Telegram kg mg
 rahane kii jagah bhi gram, taulne kii ikai bhi gram
 i am very confused this evening
 kya instagram banane vaala bhartiya gaanvon ko jaanata tha, kya kilogram kii maatra tay karne vaala kisi pracheen gaanvon kaa nivasee tha
 Now we start telling all this in prime time, then you will change the channel but we will be admitted elsewhere for treatment
 vaise bhartiya samskruti vaale agar bahut thake na hon to unhen kuch or naam badalane ke liye de saktaa hum jinhen pukaarane main mujhe badi dikkat aati he
 All these names are from the apartments in Gurgaon
 Hibiscus luxury apartments, DLF skycourt, M3M golf estate, Malibu towne, Ambience Caitriona, Palm spring plaza, Spaze, Aralias, Hamilton Court, The World Spa, The Laburnum Complex
 To call a few names, you need to have at least a bachelor's degree in English and to change them, a bachelor's degree in Sanskrit is mandatory
 vatika city, nirvana country, gudgaanv van jaise naam bhi hai jinhen sunakar lagata he ki hindi angreji sanskrit kaa mishran ho gaya he
 The rest of the names have been imposed on us from France and Spain without fulfilling the conditions of mixing
 honda city shahar he yaa car he
 Why the car is named Honda City
 phir huda city kya he
 For smart city, could we not choose names from Sanskrit and Hindi? pataa nahin ham kaise itani upeksha bardaasht kar rahe hai
 Once we are free to change the names of apartments, villages and cities, it is important that we all start to Indianize the names of cars so that no one feels that we like to sit vacant
 udhaaharan ke liye balino, swift didiyaar, rino quid, creta, lambretta, accent, brio, pasaat
 The comments kya aap aurangzeb road kaa naam badal kar apije kalam karne se zyada yaad karte hai, kanat place kaa naam rajeev chowk karne ke baad aap rajeev chowk pukaarte hai yaa kanat place
 Ekalavya will also come whenever Dronacharya's name comes
 uske saath kii ninsaphi bhi bharat main ek bade tabake ko chubhti he
 While recounting his political identity, he recalls in every other article and song how Dronacharya has crushed the talent of the Dalit tribals by asking for a thumbs-up, but the culture belongs to him who is the government
 kam se kam naam badalane ke maamle main to hoti hi he
 But even the Guru Dronacharya Award given to the sports coach is no less big
 isliye naam badalane ke faisle ko is rup main dekhiye ki iske bahaane kitna kuch aap palat kar dekh sakate hai
 Can know hansi mazaaq ke alaava
 There are some people in this stampede who are registering the domain for the website named Dhadhadhara Gurugram, while some are already sitting
 chatur logon ne gurugram naam se website se lekar twitor tak ke handle le liye hai

 gudgaanv kaa zyaadaatar vistaar gudgaanv vidhansabha or badshahpur vidhansabha ke gaanvon kii zamin par hua he
 One part of DLF comes in Badshahpur Assembly and one part in Gurgaon Assembly
 gudgaanv vidhansabha main gudgaanv ke alaava paanch or gaanv aate hai jinke naam hai, wazirabad, chakarpur, sukhrali, canahai silokada
 The Gurgaon Legislative Assembly is considered urban, with a voting percentage of 69 in the previous assembly
 2 pratishat tha
 Even then, the condition of the facilities in Gurgaon seems to be crispy
 aadhunik bharat main naam badalane par pracheen bharat ke itihaas or mithkon kii kaaphi chalati he
 It was told that the people of Agra and Delhi should not claim Gurgaon, while there is information on the district's website that during the time of Akbar this suba used to come in Delhi and Agra
 khayr ab to akbar bhi great nahin rahe to gudgaanv kya rahegaa
 Why are people so emotional? pehle bhi kitni baar naam badale hai
 Calcutta was Kolkata before our eyes
 bombai bhi hamaari ankhon ke saamne mumbai ho gaya
 When Bangalore became Bangalore, we fought a lot with small u and big U
 upi main kuch zile hai jinke naam mayawati ke aane par badal jate hai or jane par phir badal jate hai
 Like before Amethi was kept as Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharajnagar, then it became Amethi
 zaruri nahin ki kisi jagah kaa prachlit naam badalane ke liye vahaan koi us naam kaa gaanv ho hi yaa koi vahaan kaa ho
 Whatever happens in power, they can do anything
 upi ke shamali ko prabud nagar kar diya gaya tha
 Initially there is a ruckus when the names are changed, but soon people settle down
 gudgaanv vaale bhi kar hi jaaenge
 When Millennium City was called, he was not sentimental about Gurgaon
 ab guru gram ko lekar kyon hone lage hai
 What was the benefit of doing Guru Gram? kya vaaki isse itihaas kii vaapasi ho jaati he
 If the name does not change, so much can be done about Gurgaon also
 hamaari janata vaaki creative he
 There is a rapid metro rail line in this Gurgaon
 iske steshnon kaa naam sunakar to yahaan ke logon kii jubaan bhi ladkadaa jaati hogi
 Will all these names be erased after becoming Guru Gram
 phej thri stesan, micromax maulasari avenu, inds ind bank sibar city, vodaphone belwadier tower, fez tu
 The names of the stations have also become like shops
 praayojak ko bhi stesan mil saktaa he
 Do you know the city tomorrow and Vodafone Guru Village
 phir log kanphyus ho jaaenge ki guru dron kaa gurudakshina main gaanv vodaphone ne diya tha yaa pandavon ne
 By the way, there is another line of metro which is called Yellow Line
 jo dilli ke jahangirpuri se shuru hokar gudgaanv ke huda city centre tak jaati he
 If you come from Delhi, after Arjan Garh, there is a station named Guru Dronacharya Metro Station
 yahaan par 1955 se ek college bhi he jiskaa naam guru dronacharya ejineering college he
 Among the gurus, the place of this college named after Guru Dronacharya should have been higher than the IIT
 yahaan bane dronacharya mandir se prerana paakar in guruon ne ek se ek arjuna paidaa kiye honge
 Whatever it is, it shows that these names exist in the local tradition
 par kya jab pandavon ne is gaanv ko daan main diya hoga to guru gram hi naam hoga yaa kuch or naam rahaa hoga
 If the original is to be known, the name of the village which was donated should be traced
 guru gram ko lekar twitor par tukbandiya chal rahi hai

 rahane kii jagah bhi gram, taulne kii ikai bhi gram
 i am very confused this evening
 kya instagram banane vaala bhartiya gaanvon ko jaanata tha, kya kilogram kii maatra tay karne vaala kisi pracheen gaanvon kaa nivasee tha
 Now we start telling all this in prime time, then you will change the channel but we will be admitted elsewhere for treatment
 vaise bhartiya samskruti vaale agar bahut thake na hon to unhen kuch or naam badalane ke liye de saktaa hum jinhen pukaarane main mujhe badi dikkat aati he
 All these names are from the apartments in Gurgaon
 Hibiscus luxury apartments, DLF skycourt, M3M golf estate, Malibu towne, Ambience Caitriona, Palm spring plaza, Spaze, Aralias, Hamilton Court, The World Spa, The Laburnum Complex
 To call a few names, you need to have at least a bachelor's degree in English and to change them, a bachelor's degree in Sanskrit is mandatory
 vatika city, nirvana country, gudgaanv van jaise naam bhi hai jinhen sunakar lagata he ki hindi angreji sanskrit kaa mishran ho gaya he
 The rest of the names have been imposed on us from France and Spain without fulfilling the conditions of mixing
 honda city shahar he yaa car he
 Why the car is named Honda City
 phir huda city kya he
 For smart city, could we not choose names from Sanskrit and Hindi? pataa nahin ham kaise itani upeksha bardaasht kar rahe hai
 Once we are free to change the names of apartments, villages and cities, it is important that we all start to Indianize the names of cars so that no one feels that we like to sit vacant
 udhaaharan ke liye balino, swift didiyaar, rino quid, creta, lambretta, accent, brio, pasaat
 The comments kya aap aurangzeb road kaa naam badal kar apije kalam karne se zyada yaad karte hai, kanat place kaa naam rajeev chowk karne ke baad aap rajeev chowk pukaarte hai yaa kanat place
 Ekalavya will also come whenever Dronacharya's name comes
 uske saath kii ninsaphi bhi bharat main ek bade tabake ko chubhti he
 While recounting his political identity, he recalls in every other article and song how Dronacharya has crushed the talent of the Dalit tribals by asking for a thumbs-up, but the culture belongs to him who is the government
 kam se kam naam badalane ke maamle main to hoti hi he
 But even the Guru Dronacharya Award given to the sports coach is no less big
 isliye naam badalane ke faisle ko is rup main dekhiye ki iske bahaane kitna kuch aap palat kar dekh sakate hai
 Can know hansi mazaaq ke alaava
 There are some people in this stampede who are registering the domain for the website named Dhadhadhara Gurugram, while some are already sitting
 chatur logon ne gurugram naam se website se lekar twitor tak ke handle le liye hai
 On the Who is website, you can search the domain about who has such a website
 ek sajjan ne gurugram dot kaam yaa oarji yaa net, bij naam se tri kiya to saare domen bik gaye
 Many domains are already registered, but many websites have been registered since the announcement of April 12, named Gurugram
 ek sajjan ne kisi ko bolaa ki gurugram naam se ek site ko bechney ke liye kaaphi paise maange
 So this is a side too
 kisi ne gurugram bijepi, gurugram aap, naam se bhi twitor handle bana liye hai
 Do you know what it will cost? kisi ne bataaya ki chunaavon ke dauraan aise domen ke achche paise mil jate hai
 The district of Gurgaon, which you know, has 9 legislative assemblies
 puure zile main 246 gaanv aate hai
 Most of the expansion of Gurgaon has taken place on the land of the villages of Gurgaon Assembly and Badshahpur Assembly
 dlef kaa ek hissaa badshahpur vidhansabha main aata he or ek hissaa gudgaanv vidhansabha main aata he
 In addition to Gurgaon, five more villages are named in the Gurgaon Assembly, namely, Wazirabad, Chakarpur, Sukharali, Kanhai Silokra
 gudgaanv vidhansabha shahari mana jaataa he, pichley vidhansabha main yahaan kaa matdaan pratishat tha 69
 Was 2 percent
 tab bhi gudgaanv kii suvidhaon kii haalat khasta hi nazar aati he
 Changing the name of modern India carries a lot of history and myths of ancient India
 ye isliye bataaya ki agra or dilli vaale gudgaanv par daawa na karen jabaki jila kii website par jaankaree he ki akbar ke samay main yah suba dilli or agra main aata tha
 Well, if Akbar is not great now, what will be Gurgaon? log itnaa imotional kyon he
 How many times have names been changed before
 kalakatta hamaari ankhon ke saamne kolkata hua
 Bombay also became Mumbai before our eyes
 bangalore jab bangaleru hua to hamane choti u or badi uu ko lekar kaaphi maaramaari kii
 There are some districts in UP whose names change after Mayawati's arrival and change again when they leave
 jaise pehle amethi ko chhatrapatishahu ji maharajanagar rakh diya tha phir wo amethi ho gaya
 It is not necessary that in order to change the nickname of some place, there must be a village of that name or there is someone there
 satta main jo hota he wo kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 Shamli of UP was made an enlightened city
 shuru main naamon ke badalane par hangaamaa hota he lekin jaldi hi log settle kar jate hai
 The people of Gurgaon will also do it
 jab milnenium city kaha gaya tab to ve gudgaanv ko lekar bhavuk nahin hote the
 Now why are the gurus starting to talk about the village
 guru gram karne kaa phayda kya hua
 Is it really a return to history? naam na badalata to gudgaanv ko lekar bhi itane latife rache ja sakate hai pataa nahin chalata
 Our people are really creative
 isi gudgaanv main rapid metro rail line he
 Hearing the name of its stations, the people of this place must have been stunned
 kya ye saare naam guru gram ho jane se mit jaaenge
 Phase Three Station, Micromax Maulsari Avenue, Indus Ind Bank Cyber city, Vodafone Belvedere Tower, Phase Two
 steshnon ke naam bhi dukaan kii tarah ho gaye hai
 The sponsor may also find the station
 kya pataa kal shahar hi mil jaae or vodaphone guru gram ho jaae
 Then people will be confused whether Vodafone had given the village of Guru Drona in Gurudakshina or by the Pandavas
 vaise metro kii ek or line he jise yelo line kehete hai
 Which starts from Jahangirpuri in Delhi and moves to Gurgaon's Huda City Center
 dilli se aap aaenge to arjan garh ke baad ek stesan padataa he jiskaa naam he guru dronacharya metro stesan
 There is also a college here since 1955 called Guru Dronacharya Engineering College
 guruon main guru dronacharya ke naam par bane is college kaa sthaan to iaiti se bhi ooncha hona chahie tha
 Inspired by the Dronacharya temple built here, these gurus may have produced Arjuna one by one
 jo bhi he isse pataa chalata he ki sthaneey parampara main in naamon kaa vajood to he
 But what if the Pandavas donated this village, then the name of the village will be the name or something else
 agar mul main hi janaa he to jis naam kaa gaanv daan main diya gaya tha usee kaa pataa lagaaya jaae
 Tukbandia is going on tweeter about Guru Gram
 instagram, telegram kilogram milligram
 Village to place of residence, village to weigh unit too
 main to aaj kii shaam bahut kanfus hum
 Did the installer know the Indian villages, was the resident of any of the ancient villages fixing a kilogram
 ab ye sab ham prime time main bataane lage to aap to channel badal lenge lekin ham kahin or bhartee ho jaaenge ilaaj ke liye
 By the way, if the Indian culture is not very tired, then i can give them something else to change the name, which i have a problem in calling
 ye saare naam gudgaanv ke apartment ke hi hai
 Hibiscus luxury apartments, DLF skycourt, M3M golf estate, Malibu towne, Ambience Caitriona, Palm spring plaza, Spaze, Aralias, Hamilton Court, The World Spa, The Laburnum Complex
 kuch naamon ko pukaarane ke liye aapako kam se kam angrezi main snaatak hona hoga or in sabko badalane ke liye sanskrit main snaatak hona to anivaary he hi
 There are also names like Vatika City, Nirvana Country, Gurgaon Forest, which seems to be that Hindi has become a mixture of English Sanskrit
 baaki naam to mishran kii sharton ko puraa kiye bina ham par france or spain se laakar thope diye gaye hai
 Honda city is city or car
 car kaa naam honda city kyon he
 Then what is Huda City
 smart city ke liye kya ham sanskrit or hindi se naam nahin chun sakate the
 i do not know how we are tolerating so much neglect
 ek baar jaraa ham apartment, gaanv or shaharon ke naam badalane se free ho len to zaruri he ki ham sab milakar kaaron ke naamon ke bhartiyakaran main lag jaaen taaki kisi ko na lage ki ham khaali baithna pasand karte hai
 For example Ballino, Swift Desire, Rino Quid, Creta, Lambretta, Accent, Brio, Passat
 tippaniyan Do you remember more than changing the name of Aurangzeb Road to APJ Kalam, do you call Rajiv Chowk after the name of Connaught Place or Rajiv Chowk or Connaught Place
 dronacharya kaa naam jab bhi aata he eklavya kaa bhi aayega
 The injustice done to him also stings a large section in India
 wo apni raajnneetik pahchaan kii vyakhya karte vakt har duusare lekh or geet main yaad karata he daliton adivaasiyon kii pratibha ko dronacharyon ne kis tarah angootha mangakar kuchlaa he par samskruti uski hoti he jisaki sarkaar hoti he
 At least in case of change of name
 lekin khelon ke coach ko diya jane vaala guru dronacharya award bhi to kam bada nahin mana jaataa
 Therefore, look at the decision to change the name as to how much you can turn around and see
 jaan sakate hai
 Apart from laughing jokes

 Instagram, Telegram kg mg
 rahane kii jagah bhi gram, taulne kii ikai bhi gram
 i am very confused this evening
 kya instagram banane vaala bhartiya gaanvon ko jaanata tha, kya kilogram kii maatra tay karne vaala kisi pracheen gaanvon kaa nivasee tha
 Now we start telling all this in prime time, then you will change the channel but we will be admitted elsewhere for treatment
 vaise bhartiya samskruti vaale agar bahut thake na hon to unhen kuch or naam badalane ke liye de saktaa hum jinhen pukaarane main mujhe badi dikkat aati he
 All these names are from the apartments in Gurgaon
 Hibiscus luxury apartments, DLF skycourt, M3M golf estate, Malibu towne, Ambience Caitriona, Palm spring plaza, Spaze, Aralias, Hamilton Court, The World Spa, The Laburnum Complex
 To call a few names, you need to have at least a bachelor's degree in English and to change them, a bachelor's degree in Sanskrit is mandatory
 vatika city, nirvana country, gudgaanv van jaise naam bhi hai jinhen sunakar lagata he ki hindi angreji sanskrit kaa mishran ho gaya he
 The rest of the names have been imposed on us from France and Spain without fulfilling the conditions of mixing
 honda city shahar he yaa car he
 Why the car is named Honda City
 phir huda city kya he
 For smart city, could we not choose names from Sanskrit and Hindi? pataa nahin ham kaise itani upeksha bardaasht kar rahe hai
 Once we are free to change the names of apartments, villages and cities, it is important that we all start to Indianize the names of cars so that no one feels that we like to sit vacant
 udhaaharan ke liye balino, swift didiyaar, rino quid, creta, lambretta, accent, brio, pasaat
 The comments kya aap aurangzeb road kaa naam badal kar apije kalam karne se zyada yaad karte hai, kanat place kaa naam rajeev chowk karne ke baad aap rajeev chowk pukaarte hai yaa kanat place
 Ekalavya will also come whenever Dronacharya's name comes
 uske saath kii ninsaphi bhi bharat main ek bade tabake ko chubhti he
 While recounting his political identity, he recalls in every other article and song how Dronacharya has crushed the talent of the Dalit tribals by asking for a thumbs-up, but the culture belongs to him who is the government
 kam se kam naam badalane ke maamle main to hoti hi he
 But even the Guru Dronacharya Award given to the sports coach is no less big
 isliye naam badalane ke faisle ko is rup main dekhiye ki iske bahaane kitna kuch aap palat kar dekh sakate hai
 Can know hansi mazaaq ke alaava
 There are some people in this stampede who are registering the domain for the website named Dhadhadhara Gurugram, while some are already sitting
 chatur logon ne gurugram naam se website se lekar twitor tak ke handle le liye hai
 On the Who is website, you can search the domain about who has such a website
 ek sajjan ne gurugram dot kaam yaa oarji yaa net, bij naam se tri kiya to saare domen bik gaye
 Many domains are already registered, but many websites have been registered since the announcement of April 12, named Gurugram
 ek sajjan ne kisi ko bolaa ki gurugram naam se ek site ko bechney ke liye kaaphi paise maange
 So this is a side too
 kisi ne gurugram bijepi, gurugram aap, naam se bhi twitor handle bana liye hai
 Do you know what it will cost? kisi ne bataaya ki chunaavon ke dauraan aise domen ke achche paise mil jate hai
 Hibiscus luxury apartments, DLF skycourt, M3M golf estate, Malibu towne, Ambience Caitriona, Palm spring plaza, Spaze, Aralias, Hamilton Court, The World Spa, The Laburnum Complex
 kuch naamon ko pukaarane ke liye aapako kam se kam angrezi main snaatak hona hoga or in sabko badalane ke liye sanskrit main snaatak hona to anivaary he hi
 There are also names like Vatika City, Nirvana Country, Gurgaon Forest, which seems to be that Hindi has become a mixture of English Sanskrit
 baaki naam to mishran kii sharton ko puraa kiye bina ham par france or spain se laakar thope diye gaye hai
 Honda city is city or car
 car kaa naam honda city kyon he
 Then what is Huda City
 smart city ke liye kya ham sanskrit or hindi se naam nahin chun sakate the
 i do not know how we are tolerating so much neglect
 ek baar jaraa ham apartment, gaanv or shaharon ke naam badalane se free ho len to zaruri he ki ham sab milakar kaaron ke naamon ke bhartiyakaran main lag jaaen taaki kisi ko na lage ki ham khaali baithna pasand karte hai
 For example Ballino, Swift Desire, Rino Quid, Creta, Lambretta, Accent, Brio, Passat
 tippaniyan Do you remember more than changing the name of Aurangzeb Road to APJ Kalam, do you call Rajiv Chowk after the name of Connaught Place or Rajiv Chowk or Connaught Place
 dronacharya kaa naam jab bhi aata he eklavya kaa bhi aayega
 The injustice done to him also stings a large section in India
 wo apni raajnneetik pahchaan kii vyakhya karte vakt har duusare lekh or geet main yaad karata he daliton adivaasiyon kii pratibha ko dronacharyon ne kis tarah angootha mangakar kuchlaa he par samskruti uski hoti he jisaki sarkaar hoti he
 At least in case of change of name
 lekin khelon ke coach ko diya jane vaala guru dronacharya award bhi to kam bada nahin mana jaataa
 Therefore, look at the decision to change the name as to how much you can turn around and see
 jaan sakate hai
