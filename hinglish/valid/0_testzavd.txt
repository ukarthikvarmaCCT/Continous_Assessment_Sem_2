 The crew for the Gemini 8 vehicle was announced on 20 September 1965 and Neil Armstrong was named its command pilot and David Scott as the pilot
 yah mishan 16 march 1966 ko launch kiya gaya
 This was the most complex mission of its time in which an unmanned aerial vehicle was to be abandoned first and to be added to space by Titan II, which had Armstrong and Scott aboard

 Later wrote that the crew did exactly as they were trained, they made a mistake because we gave them the wrong training
 abhiyaan ko plan karne waalon ne yah moolbhoot baat nahin sochaa tha ki jab do yaan ek duusare se judenge to unhen uske baad ek yaan maan kar chalanaa hoga
 Armstrong himself was deeply depressed as the campaign period was shortened and most of its goals were aborted
 armastrang kii gemini program main aakhri bhoomika gemini 11 ke byaap-cmand payalat kii rahi
 It was announced two days after Gemini 8 returned to Earth
 armastrang is baad apane do safal abhiyaanon ke anubhav ke kaaran kaafii had tak ek sikhaane vaale kii bhoomika main the
 It was launched on 12 September 1966, with Pete Konrad and Dick Gordon boarding the vehicle, and Armstrong playing his role as a capsule communicator
 yah abhiyaan apane nirdhaarit lakshyon ko praapt karne main puri tarah safal rahaa
 After this flight, President Johnson sent Armstrong and his wife on a Goodwill trip to South America

 Armstrong served in the Apollo 8 campaign, and thereafter, he received a proposal to be made commander of Apollo 11 on 23 December 1968
 yojana ke anusaar armastrang ko commander kaa daayitv nibhaana tha, lunar modul kaa pilot baz elderin ko or cmand modul kaa pilot maaikel collins ko hona tha
 At a meeting in March 1969, it was decided that Armstrong would be the first to land on the moon
 is nirnay main kuch bhoomika is baat kii bhi thi ki nasa prabandhan kaa yah maananaa tha ki armastrang ek vinamr swabhaav ke vyakti hai
 At a press conference on 14 April 1969, it was reported that the design of the Lunar module was such that its door was to open to the right, and therefore the pilot sitting on the right was difficult to descend first
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki protocol ke mutabiq armastrang, jo ki abhiyaan ke commander the, ko pehle utarane kaa mauqaa diya janaa chaiye
 During the launch of Apollo 11, Armstrong's heart rate reached 110 pulses per minute
 armastrang ko iskaa pratham charan sabase adhik shor bharaa prathit hua, unke pichley gemini 8 titan II launch se kaafii zyada
 Apollo's command module was definitely more spacious than Gemini
 sambhawatah yahi kaaran bhi tha ki adhik jagah hone ke kaaran iske yatriyon ko spes sickness kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 The goal of Apollo 11 was not to land with precision at a specific location but to land safely
 chaand par utarate samay teen minute kii samyawashi ke baad armastrang ne mahasoos kiya ki unki gati yojana se kuch second adhik he or eagle shaayad plan ke mutabiq chune sthal se kai mile dur jaakar utrega
 Some computer error warnings also surfaced when the eagle's landing radar received surface data
 pehali chetavanee truti 1202 ke rup main aayi, or apane vistrut prashikshan ke baavzood elderin athwa armastrang kisi ko nahin pataa tha ki iskaa kya matlab he
 He immediately received a message from capsule communicator Charles Duke that these error warnings are not a concern and are due to computer overflow
 jab armastrang ne yah lakshith kiya ki ve surakshit landing ke kshetra se baahar ja rahe hai, unhone lunar modul kaa niyantran apane haathon main le liya or ise surakshit utaarne kii jagah talashne kaa prayaas kiya
 This work was likely to take some time and was also a matter of concern as it was expected to run out of fuel for the lunar module
 landing ke baad elderin or armastrang ko laga ki unke paas 40 second kaa idhan maujuud he jisamen vah 20 second kaa eendhan bhi shaamil tha jise mishan ke nirast karne kii dasha main bhi bachaana tha
 Analyzes after the end of the mission found that there was fuel left for propulsion for approximately 45 to 50 seconds
 chaand ki sataha par landing 20:17:40 utisi ke kuch secondon baad, july 20, 1969 ko hui, jab lunar modul ke chaar pairon main se teen ke saath jude teen lambey probs main se ek chandramaa kii sataha ke sampark main aayaa or modul ke andar suchak lit jal gayi or elderin ne ghoshnaa kii "contact lit"
 Armstrong instructed to shut down the engine and after a few seconds of checking the landing system, Armstrong announced, "houston, tranquility base here
" di eagle hes landed
 "aldrin and Armstrong shook hands and patted each other
 kuch secondon baad jamini sampark sthal se duk ne sandesh prapti conform kii
 However, according to nasa's official plan, the crew had to rest for some time before the extravascular activity after landing on the moon, with Armstrong requesting the move first
 ek baar jab elderin or armastrang baahar jane ke liye taiyaar ho chuke, eagle vayudab mukt kiya gaya or daravaaje ko kholaa gaya
 Armstrong landed on the ladder
 seedhi par neeche khadey hokar unhone kaha, "ab main chhaliium se neeche utarane vaala hoon" 
 He then turned and put his left foot on the moon's surface at 2:56 UTC July 21, 1969, and said the famous words, "that's one small step of man, one giant leap for mankind"

 When Armstrong and Aldrin Lunar returned to the module, the door was closed and sealed

 kumaanun kshetra main kai upbhashaain boli jaati hai
 Some of the main local languages are as follows: - kumaanun shabd kii vyutpati ke sambadh main vibhinn mat prachlit rahe hai
 From the point of view of language, it seems appropriate that this word is originally Kurma in Sanskrit
 champavat ke sameep 2196 meter unchaa kanteshwar parvat he jiske sambadh main manyata he ki bhagwaan vishnu apane dwitiya avatar main is parvat par teen varsh tak rahe
 Since then, he came to be known as kurm-anchal in place of Mount Kanteshwar
 is parvat kii akruti bhi kacchap kii peeth jaisi jaan padati he
 Probably this is the reason why this region may have been named as Kurmanchal
 pehle shaayad kurm shabd prayog main aata hoga, kyonki kurm shabd kaa prayog sthaneey bhashaa main bahutayat se miltaa he
 One of the reasons that the word Kumun may be replaced in place of Kurm can also be that the dialect here is found to be more uplifting
 kaalaantar main saahitiyik granthon, tamrapatron main kumuun ke sthaan par kumu or uske baad kumaun shabd sweekrut hua
 The use of the word Kurmanchal is also found in Sanskrit texts
 pramanik aitihaasik tathyon ke abhaav main nishchit rup se kahana kathin he ki multah kumaun kshetra main kin-kin maanav jatiyon kaa prabhutv tha
 It is known from certain references available in Mahabharata, Purana and ancient Sanskrit literature that the caste, Kirat, Kinnar, Yaksha, Tangava, Kulind, Khas etc
 were inhabited here

 It has come to Dronaparva that the said mountainous castes took part in the battle of Mahabharata with stone weapons from Duryodhana and threw stones at Krishna's charioteer Satyaki, but they could not stand in front of Satyaki's slogans

 Apart from the Yaksha caste, there are also signs of residence of the Naga caste in Kumaon in the Adi era
 pithauragarh jile ke berinag naamak sthaan main binaag / beninag kaa prasiddh mandir he
 There are many temples in Kumaon named after the serpents
 jaise dhulanag, kalinag, pinglanag, kharharinag, basuki naag, nagdev ityadi
 The existence of Yaksha and Naga castes in the primitive castes of Kumaon is based on conjectures, but in relation to the Kirat caste, some societies can be said on the basis of classical and anthropological evidence that in the prehistoric era, the land of kumaon-garhwal, Kirat, Mongol The Adi was the abode of the non-aryan castes, who were conquered by the non-vedic Aryans who came from the north-west side at a time

 is aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aaryon ke aagaman se pehle yahan munda tathaa tibeti parivaar kii bhashaa bolne vaale log nivas karte rahe honge
 The prevalence of Shaka Samvat in Kumaon and the existence of Katarmal Sun Temple near Kosi in Almora confirms the possibility that after the primitive castes of Kirat, Raji, Nag, etc
, the Shaka caste has existed here
 gadnath, jagnath, bholanath aadi lok devataaon ke mandiron tathaa gadnath aadi naamon ke aadhaar par yahan nath jati ke astitv kii bhi sambhaavna vyakt kii ja sakati he
 So indisputable that the Adi residents of Kumaon are people of Kol, Kirat, Raji Nag, Hun, Shaka, Baur, Tharu, Boksa, Bhotia and Khas

 Although there is a difference of opinion among scholars and historians also in this subject

 This fact proves that the Katyura rulers had great influence on the subjects as they built temples, sewers, ponds and markets in the public interest
