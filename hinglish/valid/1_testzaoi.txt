 " westfol 1994 pi 245 Historian Stephen D
 Snowblen says of Newton that "isaac Newton was a heretic
 lekin 


 unhone apane nijee vishwaas kii saarvajanik ghoshnaa kabhi nahin kii- jisase is roodhiwaadee ko behad kattarpanthi jo samajha gaya
 He hid his faith so well that even today scholars are unable to know his personal beliefs
 " snobelen ne nishkarsh nikaala ki newton kam se kam ek soshinian sahanubhuti rakhte the,, sambhavatya arian ore lagbhag nishchit rup se ek trinity virdohi the
 —three Purva forms that are today called Unitarianism
 unki dharmik ashishnutaa ke liye vikhyath ek yug main, newton ke kattarpanthi vichaaron ke bare main kuch saarvajanik abhivyaktiyaan hai, sabase khaas he, pavitra adeshon kaa paalan karne ke liye unke dwaara inkaar kiya janaa, ore jab ve marane vaale the tab unhen pavitra sanskaar lene ke liye kaha gaya ore unhone inkaar kar diya
 In an approach disputed by Snowbelein, TC Fijnmeyer argued that Newton held the Eastern Orthodox view of the Trinity, not the Western view of Roman Catholicism, Britishism, and most Protestants
 unke apane din main un par ek rosicrusian hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 Although the universal laws of motion and gravity became Newton's best-known inventions, he was warned against using them as a machine for viewing the universe, similar to the Great Clock
 unhone kaha, "gurutv grahon kii gati kaa varnan karata he lekin yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kisne grahon ko is gati main sthapit kiya
 God controls everything and knows what is and what can be done
 " His scientific fame is notable, as well as his early church pastors and study of the Bible
 newton ne shabdic aalochana par likhaa, sabase vishesh he
 An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruption of Scripture unhone 3 april i
 33 ko yishu messiah kaa krusaropan bhi kiya, jo ek paaramparik rup se sweekrut tarikh ke saath sahamat he
 They tried unsuccessfully to find hidden messages within the Bible
 unke apane jeevankaal main, newton ne prakritik vigyaan se adhik dharm ke bare main likhaa
vah tarkyukt vishwavyaapee duniya main vishwaas karte the, lekin unhone libanij or baruch spinoja main nihit hilosoism ko asweekaar kar diya
is prakaar, aadeshit or gatisheel rup se suchit brahmand ko samajha ja saktaa tha or ise ek sakriy kaaran ke dwaara samajha janaa chahie
unke patrachaar main, newton ne daawa kiya ki princepia main likhte samay "maine ek najar aise siddhanton par rakhi, taaki devtaa main vishwaas rakhte hue manushya par vichaar kiya ja sake
" unhone duniya kii pranali main dizin kaa pramaan dekha: grahiy pranali main aisi adbhut ekarupata ko pasand ke prabhaav kii anumati di jaani chahie
 " lekin newton ne jor diya ki asthayitv kii dhimi vruddhi ke kaaran daivi hastkshep ant main pranali ke sudhaar ke liye aavashyak hoga
 iske liye libanij Condemned him: "almighty God wants to end his watch from time to time: otherwise it will be stopped to move
 It seems that he did not have enough foresight to make it a perpetual motion
" " Newton's position was strictly defended through a famous correspondence by his follower Samuel Clarke
 newton or robert boyal ke yantric darshan ko buddhijivi kalamaghasit dwaara rudhiwaadiyon or utsaahiyon ke liye ek vyavhaarya vikalp ke rup main padonnat kiya gaya or ise roodhiwaadee prachaarkon tathaa asantusht prachaarkon jaise letitudinerian ke dwaara hichkichaakar sweekaar kiya gaya
 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"
 purv-atmagyaan ke khilaaf kiye gaye hamale "jaadui soch," or isaiyat ke rahasyamayi tatv, ko brahmand ke bare main boyal kii yantric avadharana se neenv mili
 newton ne ganitiya pramaanon ke madhyam se boyal ke vichaaron ko purna banaaya or shaayad adhik mahatvapurn rup se ve unhen lokapriy banane main bahut adhik safal hue
 newton ne ek hastkshep bhagwaan dwaara niyantrit duniya ko ek aisi duniya main badal daalaa jo tarksangat or saarvbhaumik siddhanton ke saath bhagwaan ke dwaara kalatmak rup se banaayin gayi he
 These principles are available for all people to discover, they allow people to fulfill their objectives fruitfully in this life, do not wait for the next life and make them full of their own rational powers
 newton ne bhagwaan ko mukhya nirmaataa ke rup main dekha, jiske astitv ko sabhi nirmaanon kii bhavyata ke chehre main nakaara nahin ja saktaa he
 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day
 Gone
 is sambandh main, is par nirmit saamaajik sanranchanaaon or itihaas ke adhyay tyaage ja sakate the
 It was Newton's conception of the universe based on natural and spiritually understandable rules that served as a seed for enlightenment ideology
 loke or waltair ne aantarik adhikaron kii vakaalat karte hue prakritik niyamon kii avadharana ko rajanithik pranali par lagu kiya; physiocrate or adam smith ne aatm-ruchi or manovigyaan kii prakritik avadharana ko aarthik pranali par lagu kiya tathaa samajashastriyon ne pragati ke prakritik namoonon main itihaas ko feet karne kii koshish ke liye tatkaaleen saamaajik vyavastha kii aalochana kii
 Monbodo and Samuel Clarke opposed elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalized it to ensure his strong religious views about nature
 shahi taksaal ke prabandhak ke rup main, newton ne anumaan lagaaya ki dubaara dhalaai kiye jane vaale sikkon main 20% jaali the
 Fraud was a very high treason for which there was a death sentence
 is ke baavjood, sabase jwalanth aparaadhiyon ko pakadana bahut mushkil tha; yadhyapi, newton is kaary ke liye sahi sabit hue
 bhesh badal kar sharabakhaane or jail main jaakar unhone khud bahut se saboot ikatthe kiye
 English law still had ancient and formidable customs of power, to separate all branches of government and establish all obstacles to prosecution
 newton ko shanti kaa nyaayadhish banaaya gaya or june 1698 or christmas 1699 ke bich unhone gavaah, mukhabiron or sandigdhon ke 200 parikshan karwaae
 Newton won his commitment and in February 1699 he had ten prisoners awaiting release
 raja ke vakil ke rup main newton kaa ek maamla wiliam chaloner ke khilaaf tha
 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it
 usne sansad main arji di ki sikkon kii dhalaai ke liye uski yojana ko sweekaar kar liya jaye taaki jaalsaji na kii ja sake, jabaki usee samay jaali sikke saamne aaye
 Newton tested cheating on Chaloner and in September 1697 sent him to New Gate Prison
 lekin chalonor ke ucch sthanon par mitra the, jinhone use uski rihaai ke liye madad kii
 Newton tested it for the second time with conclusive evidence
 chaloner ko ucch rajdroh kaa doshi paaya gaya tha or use 23 march 1699 ko tiburn gelos main faansee de kar dafna diya gaya
 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying
 brogdel main rashtriya falon kaa sangrah un pedo se grapht kii aapurti kar saktaa he, jo flower of kent ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, jo ek mote goode kii pakaane kii kism he

 roman sankhyank dwaara darshaayi gayi sankhyank paddatti kaa pracheen rome main udgam hua or bhalee bhaanti uttar madhya yug main purna europe main sankhyaon ko likhnaa kaa saamaanya tarika bana rahaa
 Roman numerals are the number system of ancient Rome, in which numbers were written by adding letters of Latin language
 pehle das roman ank is prakaar hai - Roman digits do not contain zeros
 inamen badi sankhyaon ko likhnaa bahut kathin ho jaataa he - ek to unamem bahut se akshar ho jate hai or unhen samajhane main bhi samay lagata he
 Because they do not have the concept of local values of the Indian system, it is very difficult to do mathematics in Roman numerals
 jaise-jaise bhartiya ank pehle madhya purv or phir europe main failane lage, roman ankon kaa prayog keval virgon-adhyyon ke naamon ke liye hi hone laga or ganit main inaki bhoomika samaapt ho gayi

 cronekar ne bhi kaha he : ishwar ne dhan purnankon kii rachana kii he, tathaa anya sabhi sankhyaayein manushya dwaara banaai hui hai
 Imagination of numbers has taken form from many general principles
 ham dhan purnankon se prarambh karte hai
 To overcome the difficulties of addition and multiplication, minus numbers and fractions were conceived and bodies of rational numbers were created
 parimey sankhyaon kaa nikaay kramit he, arthath yadi is nikaay kii do bhinn sankhyaayein k tathaa kha hon to unamem se ek duusari se badi hogi, tathaa yadi k> kha or kha >ga to k > ga jabaki k kha or ga is nikaay kii sankhyaayein hai
 If two different rational numbers a and b are given, we can always get a third rational number c, which is larger than one and smaller than the other
 isse yah siddh hota he ki kinhin do bhinn parimey sankhyaon ke bich asankhya parimey sankhyaayein hoti hai
 The inclusion of fractions and minus can be justified with two views

 The expansion of the imagination of numbers from the rational to the irrational is as natural as the numbers different from the positive integers and the negative rational numbers

 The imagery of numbers leads to the imagery of variables, which assume these values
 charon kii kalpana se ham vaastavik charon ke falan athwa sanmishra charon ke falan kii kalpana tak pahonchte hai
 Then the resulting theory of composite variables and the function of real variables is developed

 Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was shot dead in the evening of 30 January 1948 at Birla Bhawan in New Delhi
 ve roj shaam ko prarthana kiya karte the
 On the evening of 30 January 1948, as he was going for evening prayers, a man named Nathuram Godse touched his feet first and then fired three bullets at him from the front with a Barreta pistol
 us samay gandhi apane anucharon se ghire hue the
 In this case, eight people including Nathuram Godse were accused in the conspiracy to murder
 in aath logon main se teen aropiyon shankar kistaiya, digambar badge, vir saavarkar, main se digambar badge ko sarkari gavaah banane ke kaaran bari kar diya gaya
 Shankar Kistaiya was forgiven on appeal to the High Court
 vir saavarkar ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin milane kii vajah se adaalat ne jurm se mukt kar diya
 Later on the death of Savarkar, the Government of India issued a postage stamp in his honor
 or ant main bache paanch abhiyukton main se teen - gopal godse, madanlaal paahwa or vishnu ramakrishna karkare ko aaajeevan karawas hua tathaa do- nathuram godse va narayan apte ko phaansi de di gayi
 Prayers were held at Birla Bhavan at five in the evening, but Gandhiji was busy in a meeting with Sardar Patel
 tabhi sava paanch baje unhen yaad aayaa ki prarthana ke liye der ho rahi he
 The evening of 30 January 1948, when Bapu placed his hands on the shoulders of Aura and Manu moved towards the stage that Nathuram Godse came before him
 usne haath jodakar kaha - "namaste baapu!" gandhi ke saath chal rahi manu ne kaha - "bhaiya! saamne se hat jaao, baapu ko jane do
 Bapu is already late
 " lekin godse ne manu ko dhakka de diya or apane haathon main chupa rakhi choti bareta pistal se gandhi ke seene par ek ke baad ek teen goliyaan daag deen
 Two bullets escaped through Bapu's body, while one bullet stuck in his body
 78 saal ke mahatma gandhi kii hatya ho chuki thi
 Gandhi's body was covered in Birla House
 lekin jab unke sabase chote bete devdas gandhi vahaan pahunche to unhone baapu ke sharir se kapadaa hataa diya taaki duniya shaanti or ahimsa ke pujari ke saath hui hinsa ko dekh sake
 According to the statement given by Nathuram Godse in the court, the pistol with which Gandhi was targeted was purchased from a refugee in Delhi
 gandhi kii hatya karne ke maamle main mukhya abhiyukt nathuram godse sahit kul aath vyaktiyon ko aaropee banaakar mukadmaa chalaaya gaya tha
 Their names are as follows: birla bhawan main prarthana sabha ke dauraan gandhi par 10 din pehle bhi hamalaa hua tha
 a Punjabi refugee named Madanlal Pahwa had thrown a bomb targeting Gandhi but narrowly escaped
 bam saamne kii diwaar par fata jisase diwaar tut gayi
 Gandhi would never have thought that someone wanted to kill him
 gandhi ne dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan shuru kiya tha jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 50 karod rupee kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and violence would spread on the border
 gandhi kii jid ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne is rakam kaa bhugtan kar diya lekin hindu sanghathanon ko laga ki gandhi ji musalamaanon ko khush karne ke liye chaal chal rahe hai
 The incident of the bomb blast was linked to this decision of Gandhi
 nathuram isse pehle bhi baapu ke hatya kii teen baar koshish kar chukaa tha, lekin asafal hone par vah apane dost narayan apte ke saath waapas bombay chalaa gaya
 Together they along with Dattatreya Parchure and Gangadhar Dandavate bought a pistol named Barreta
 asalhe ke saath ye donon 29 janvari 1948 ko waapas dilli pahunche or dilli stesan ke ritearing room nambar 6 main tehre
 It was only five months after the country was liberated that the news of differences between Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel started coming in the media
 gandhi aisi khabaren saamne aane se behad dukhi the or ve iskaa jawaab dena chaahate the
 He even wanted him to ask Sardar Patel to resign so that Nehru would see the entire functioning of the government
 lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 On 30 January 1948, he called Patel for talks at four o'clock in the evening and after the prayer was over, asked him to discuss the issue
 lekin niyati ko yah manjuur nahin tha
 Patel along with his daughter Maniben reached Gandhi on time
 patel ke saath meeting ke baad prarthana ke liye jate samay gandhi godse kii goliyon kaa shikaar ho gayi
 Gandhi used to say that his life is in the hands of God and if he were to die then no one could save him
 unhone ek baar kaha tha-"jo azaadi ke bajaay suraksha chaahate hai unhen jeene kaa koi haq nahin he
 "though a watchman used to live at the gate of Birla Bhavan
 tatkaaleen grih mantri sardaar patel ne ehtiyaat ke taur par birla house par ek head consteble or chaar constablon kii tainaati ke aadesh diye the
 At the time of Gandhi's prayer, police used to be stationed in plain clothes in Birla Bhawan to keep an eye on every suspect
 haalanki police ne sochaa ki ehtiyaat ke taur par yadi prarthana sabha main hissaa lene ke liye aane vaale logon kii talaashi lekar unhen birla bhawan ke parisar main ghusane kii ijaajat di jaye to behatar rahegaa
 But Gandhiji did not like this idea of the police
 police ke diaiji level ke ek afasar ne bhi gandhi se is bare main baat kii or kaha ki unki jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he lekin gandhi nahin maane
 According to the FIR filed by Nandlal Mehta after Bapu's murder, the last word that came out of his mouth was 'hey Ram'
 lekin swatantrata senaanee or gandhi ke nijee sachiv ke taur par kaam kar chuke ve0 kalyanm kaa daawa he ki yah baat sach nahin he
 At the time of that incident, Kalyanam standing right behind Gandhi said that there was no question of any word coming out of Gandhi's mouth after being shot
 haalanki gandhi aksar kaha jarur karte the ki jab vah marenge to unke hothon par ram kaa naam hi hoga
 If he had been ill or lying in bed, 'ram' would have come out of his mouth
 gandhi kii hatya kii jaanch ke liye gathit ayog ne us din rashtrapita ke sabase kareeb rahe logon se poochtacha karne kii jahamat bhi nahin uthaayi
 Nevertheless, it became famous worldwide that the last word that came out of Gandhi's mouth was 'hey Ram'
 lekin ise kabhi sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 There is no information as to why he was taken back to Birla House instead of being taken to hospital despite being shot
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki mahatma gandhi ke ek paariwarik mitra ne unki asthiyaan lagbhag 62 saal tak gopneey jagah par rakhin jise 30 janvari 2010 ko durban ke samudr main pravaahit kiya gaya
 Faced with fears of misuse of its destructive power after making the world known to the nuclear potential, Albert Einstein was desperate to meet non-violence priest Mahatma Gandhi
 parantu unki yah ichha puri nahin ho saki
 According to the compilation of Albano Muller, in a letter to Bapu in 1931, Einstein expressed his desire to meet him
 oinstin ne patr main likhaa tha-"aapane apane kaam se yah sabit kar diya he ki aise logon ke saath bhi ahimsa ke jariye jeet hasil kii ja sakati he jo hinsa ke maarg ko khaarij nahin karte
 i hope that your example will not be bound within the boundaries of the country but will be established at the international level
 main ummid karata hoon ki ek din main aapse mulaakaat kar paaoonga
 " oinstin ne baapu ke bare main likhaa he ki mahatma gandhi kii uplabdhiyaan raajnneetik itihaas main adbhut hai
 He chose a new path of struggle to free the country from slavery which is humane and unique
 yah ek aisa maarg he jo puri duniya ke sabhy samaaj ko maanavtaa ke bare main sochane ko majaboor karata he
 He wrote that we should be happy that the fortune gifted us in his time as a man who will be a guide for generations to come
 congress gandhi ko apana adarsh bataate nahin thakti jabaki usee party ke log gandhi ke jite ji unka niraadar kiya karte the
 This note is made clear by a note by the then Governor of Bihar, Morris Hallett
 "agar mujhe kisi pagal aadmi kii goli se bhi maranaa ho to mujhe muskaraate hue maranaa chaiye
 Only God's name should be on my heart and tongue
 or agar aisa kuch hota he to tum logon ko ansu kaa ek kataraa bhi nahin bahaanaa
 " – mohandas karamchand gandhi 28 janvari 1948 During his entire lifetime, Mahatma Gandhi wrote about 35 thousand letters
 in patron main baapu apane sahyogiyon, shishyon, mitron, sambandhiyon aadi ko unke chhadam naam se sambodhit karte the
 For example, Bapu Sarojini Naidu got "my Dear Peacemaker!", "singer and Guardian of My Soul!", "my Dear Fly!" Used to address Adi, while Princess Amrit Kaur was called "my dear rabble!" Used to say liyo tolsty ko baapu sar or adolf hitler va albert oinstin ko "maai dear phend!" kehete the
 According to the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi Volume-54, Mahatma Gandhi replied to Einstein's letter on 18 October 1931
 jawaab main unhone likhaa - "sundaram ke madhyam se mujhe aapkaa sundar patr mila
 i got satisfaction that the work i am doing is right in your eyes
 main ummid karata hoon ki bharat main mere ashram main aapse meri aamane saamne mulaakaat hogi
 " kya yah daayitv jawahar laal nehru jo desh ke pradhan mantri the, athwa sardaar patel, jo grih mantri the unka nahin tha? aakhir 20 janvari 1948 ko paahwa dwaara gandhiji kii prarthana-sabha main bam-visphot ke thik 10 din baad usee prarthana sabha main usee samooh ke ek sadsy nathuram godse ne gandhi ke seene main 3 goliyaan utaar kar unhen sadaa sadaa ke liye samaapt kar diya
 This question was raised long ago in 1984 after the death of Indira Gandhi in a poem titled Murderer politics, which remains unanswered till date

 Jarasandha was the king of the kingdom of Mahabharata, Magadha
 vah bahut hi shaktishaalee raja tha or uskaa sapana chakravati samraat banane kaa tha
 Although he was a powerful king, he was very cruel
 ajey ho k apana sapana puraa karne ke liye usne bahut se raajaaon ko apane karagaar main bandi banaakar rakhaa tha
 He was the father-in-law and supreme friend of Yaduvanshi Naresh Kansa of Mathura
 Both his daughters Asit and Pramit were married to Kansa
 shrikrishna se kansa vadh kaa pratishodh lene ke liye usne 17 baar mathura par chadhaai kii lekin har baar use asafal hona padaa
 Jarasandha was Sri Krishna's ultimate enemy and a warrior
 jaraasandh ke pita the magadhanaresh maharaj brihadrath or unki do patraniyaan thi
 He wanted both of them to be the same
 bahut samay vyateet ho gaya or ve buudhe ho chale the, lekin unki koi santan nahin thi
 Then once he heard that the sage Chandkaushik was in his kingdom and he is sitting under a mango tree
 yah sunate hi rajan ashapurna hokar rishi se milane chal die
 Reaching the sage, he told the sage his sorrow
 raja kaa vrutant sunakar rishi ko dayaa aa gai or unhone naresh ko ek aam diya or kaha kii ise apni rani ko khilaa dena
 But since he had two wives and loved them equally, he fed them to their two queens in equal pieces of that mango
 isse dono raniyon ko aadhe-aadhe putr hue
 In fear, they threw both of them into the forest
 tabhi vahaan se jaraa naamak ek rakshasi bhi ja rahi thi
 He saw those two carcasses of meat and he took the right carcass in the right hand and the left carcass in the left hand, adding both the pieces
 judate hi us balak ne bahut jor kii garjana kii jisase bhaybheet hokar jaraa rakshasi bhaag gai or rajbhavan main donon raniyon kii chaati se dudh utar aayaa
 That's why his name was Jarasandha
 is prakaar jaraasandh kaa janm hua
 After the completion of the construction of Indraprastha city, one day Narada Muni conveyed his father's message to Maharaja Yudhishthira that he should perform Rajasuya Yajna
 is vishay par maharaj ne shrikrishna se baat kii to unhone bhi yudhisthir ko rajasuya yajna karne ke liye protsaahit kiya, lekin maharaj yudhisthir ke chakravarti samraat banane ke maarg main keval ek roda tha, magadh naresh jaraasandh, jise parrast kiye bina vah samraat nahin ban sakate the or naa hi use ranbhumi me parrast kiya ja saktaa tha
 To solve this problem, along with Shri Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna, they disguised themselves as Brahmins and headed towards Magadha
 vahaan pahunch kar jaraasandh ne unhen brahman samajhakar kuch maang lene ke liye kaha lakin us samay brahman bheshadhari shrikrishna ne kaha kii abhi unke dono mitron kaa maun vrath he jo ardh raatri main samaapt hoga
 Then Jarasandha promised to come only at midnight and put him in the Brahmin room
 tab ardharatri main vah aayaa lekin use un teenon par kuch andeh hua kii ve brahman nahin he kayoki ve sharir se kshatriya jaise lag rahe the usne apane andeh ko prakat kiya or unhe unke vaastavik rup main aane ko kaha evm unhe pahchaan liya
 Then he got angry after hearing the goodness of Shri Krishna and asked him to take whatever he wanted and go away from here
 tab unhone brahman bhesh main hi jaraasandh ko mallayuddh karne ke liye kaha or phir apana vaastavik parichay diya
 Jarasamgh was a brave warrior, so he chose Bhima for the Malla war
 tab agle usne bhim ke saath mallbhumi main mall yuddh kiya
 This war lasted for about 28 days but he would rejoin each time Bhimsen broke it in two
 is par shrikrishna ne ghaas kii ek tandi kii sahaayta se bhim ko sanket kiya kii is baar vah uske tukade kar ke donon tukade alag-alag disha main phenke
 Then Bhima did the same and thus Jarasandha was killed
 tab uskaa vadh karke un teenon ne uske bandigrih main band sabhi 86 raajaaon ko mukt kiya or shrikrishna ne jaraasandh ke putr sahadev ko raja banaaya
 Sahadeva later supported Pandavas in the Mahabharata war

 His work is considered to serve the other three varnas and to work in the craft

 The status of the Shudras varied across ages and traditions
 vaise shudra shastron main alag-alag baaten kahin gayin hai
 Even modern scholars are not unanimous on this
 udhaaharan ke liye dow bhimrao ambedkar kaa mat he ki shudra multah kshatriya the
 Similarly, Weber, Zimmer, and Ramsharan Sharma, respectively, consider the Shudras to be primarily Aryaskandha, Brahui-speaking and grave-affiliated in India
 kuch shastron ke anusaar prayek vyakti shudra paidaa hota he or praytn or vikaas se anya varna avasthaaon main pahunchataa he

 Indeed, partly because of Netaji's preference for prioritizing German support, Iqbal's position in Italy gradually became more important, so that Italy could become the main point of reference for the eastern
 niti
 Of course Chandra Bose maintained good contacts and support of friends in the Italian Foreign Office, but Foreign Minister Ciano gradually showed mistrust towards Netaji and Italy's policy became more and more supportive of Muslims in general in the struggle for Indian independence

 yadi ve tumhaari sachche man or prem-bhav se puja karenge to unki sabhi manokamana purna hogi or sabhi kaary safal honge
 The unique story of Shri Shyam Baba begins in the medieval Mahabharata
 ve pehle barbaric ke naam se jane jate the
 He is the son of Ghatotkacha, son of the very powerful Gadadhari Bhima and son of Nag Kanya Maurvi
 balykaal se hi ve bahut vir or mahaan yoddha the
 He learned martial arts from his mother and Shri Krishna
 bhagavan shiv kii ghor tapasya karke unhen prasann kiya or teen amogh baan praapt kiye; is prakaar teen bandhari ke naam se prasiddh naam praapt kiya
 Agnidev was pleased and offered him a bow, which was able to make him victorious in the three worlds
 mahabharat kaa yuddh kauravon or pandavon ke madhya aprihaary ho gaya tha, yah samachar barbaric ko praapt hue to unki bhi yuddh main sammilit hone kii ichha jaagrit hui
 When he reached to receive blessings from his mother, the mother pledged to support the loser
 ve apane nile rang ke ghode par savaar hokar teen baan or dhanush ke saath kurushetra kii ranbhumi kii ore chal pade
 The omnipresent Shri Krishna, wearing a Brahmin disguise, stopped him to learn about Barbarika and smiled at him knowing that he had come to join the war with just three arrows; Hearing this, Barbarik replied that only one arrow is enough to defeat the enemy army and after doing so, the arrow will return to Tunir
 yadi teenon baanon ko prayog main liya gaya to puure brahmand kaa vinaash ho jayega
 Knowing this, Lord Krishna challenged him to pierce and show all the leaves of this tree
 ve donon pipal ke vriksh ke neeche khadey the
 Barbarik accepted the challenge and took out an arrow from his coat and remembered God and drove the arrow towards the leaves of the tree
 baan ne kshambhar main ped ke sabhi patton ko vedh diya or shri krishna ke pair ke ird-gird chakkar lagane laga, kyonki ek patta unhone apane pair ke neeche chupa liya tha; barbaric ne kaha ki aap apane pair ko hataa lijie anyathaa ye baan aapke pair ko bhi vedh degaa
 Subsequently, Shri Krishna asked the child Barbarik from which side he would join the war; Barbaric reiterated the promise given to his mother and said that the side which was weak and losing in the war would support itself
 shri krishna jaanate the ki yuddh main haar to kauravon kii nishchit he or is kaaran agar barbaric ne unka saath diya to parinaam galat paksh main chalaa jayega
 Therefore, Shri Krishna, a Brahmin, expressed his desire for donations from Veer Barbarik
 barbaric ne unhen vachan diya or daan maangane ko kaha
 The Brahmin asked for the donation of Shisha
 vir barbaric kshan bhar ke liye achambhit hue, parantu apane vachan se adig nahin ho sakate the
 Veer Barbarik said that an ordinary Brahmin could not ask for such a donation, so prayed to make the Brahmin aware of his actual form
 brahmanroopi shri krishna apane vaastavik rup main aa gayi
 Shri Krishna explained the reason for seeking the head donation to Barbarik that before the commencement of war, for the battleground worship, the best of the three Kshatriyas have to be sacrificed for battle ground worship; So they were compelled to do so
 barbaric ne unase prarthana kii ki ve ant tak yuddh dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Shri Krishna accepted his prayer
 shri krishna is balidaan se prasann hokar barbaric ko yuddh main sarvshereshth vir kii oopaadhi se alankrita kiya
 His head was embellished on a hill near the battlefield; From where Barbarik could take stock of the entire war
 phalgun maah kii dwadashi ko unhone apane sheesh kaa daan diya tha is prakaar ve sheesh ke dani kahalaaye
 At the end of the Mahabharata war, there was a mutual dispute among the Pandavas as to who goes to the credit of victory in the war? Shri Krishna said to him that the head of Barbarika is witness to the entire war, so who can be better decisive than that? Everyone agreed and walked towards the hill, after reaching there, the head of Barbarik replied that Shri Krishna is the greatest character in winning the war, his education, presence, and strategy were decisive
 unhen yubhumi main sirf unka sudarshan chakra ghumta hua dikhaayi de rahaa tha jo shatru sena ko kaat rahaa tha
 Mahakali, on Krishna's orders, was consuming blood-filled cups of the enemy army
 shri krishna vir barbaric ke mahaan balidaan se kaaphi prasann hue or vardaan diya ki kaliyug main tum shyaam naam se jane jaaoge, kyonki us yug main haare hue kaa saath dene vaala hi shyaam naam dhaaran karne main samarth he
 His head was buried in Khatu Nagar, hence he is called Khatu Shyam Baba
 ek gaay us sthaan par aakar roj apane stanon se dugdh kii dhara swatah hi baha rahi thi
 Later, after the excavation, the head appeared, which was surrendered to a Brahmin for a few days
 ek baar khatu nagar ke raja ko swapn main mandir nirmaan ke liye or vah sheesh mandir main sushobhit karne ke liye prerit kiya gaya
 Subsequently the temple was built at that place and Ekadashi of Kartik month was decorated in the Sheesh Temple, which is celebrated as Baba Shyam's birthday
 mul mandir 1027 i

 khatushyam pariwaron kii ek badi sankhya ke parivaar devtaa he
 Shri Khatu Shyam ji's name was Barbarik in his childhood
 unki mata, gurujan evam rishtedaar unhen isi naam se jaanate the
 The name Shyam was given to him by Krishna
 inkaa yah naam inke ghunghraale bal hone ke kaaran padaa
 His story begins in the middle Mahabharata
 khatushyam ji pehle barbaric ke naam se jane jate the ve atibalashali bhim ke putr ghatotkach or naag kanya hidimbi ke putr the khatushyam ji 
 Khatu Shyam ji was very strong and brave from childhood, he learned martial arts from his mother Hidimbi and Lord Krishna
 unhone bhagavan shiv kii aradhana karke bhagavan shiv se teen anokhe baan praapt kiye the 
 In this way he came to be known as Teen Bana Dhari
 agni dev ne prasann hokar unhen dhanush pradaan kiye jo unhen tino loko main vijay dilaa saktaa tha jab mahabharat kaa yuddh corwo or pandavo ke bich chal rahaa tha jab yah baat barbaric ko pataa chali to unki bhi ichha yuddh karne kii hue 
 He went to his mother and said that i also have to fight Mahabharata, then whose mother said, son, on whose behalf will you fight
 tab unhone bolaa main haare hue kii taraf se yuddh karuga 
 While he was going to war he found a Shri Krishna on the way
 unhone poocha tum kaha ja rahe ho 
 Then Barbarik told the whole thing
 shri krishna ji bole kalyug main log tumhe shyaam ke naam se jaanege | kuki kii tum haarane vaale ke saath ho | kuki barbaric kaa sheesh khatu nagar main dafnaaya gaya tha isliye unhen khatushyam ji kehete he According to the Skanda Purana, composed by sage Ved Vyasa, Mahabali Bhima and Hidimba's son Veer Ghatotkacha won the contest for the debate on the debate over Kamakatankata, daughter of King Daityaraja Moore of Pragjyotishpur
 kamkatankakata ko "morvi" naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Ghatotkacha and Mata Morvi received a son Ratna, whose hair was like Babbar's lion and was named Barbarik
 ye vahi vir barbaric hai jinhen aaj log khatu ke shri shyaam, kalyug ke avatar, shyaam sarkaar, teen bandhari, sheesh ke dani, khatu naresh va anya anginat naamon se jane jate hai
 After the birth of Barbarik, Mahabali Ghatotkacha took him to Lord Krishna in Dwarka and upon seeing him, Shri Krishna said to Veer Barbarik - o son Morvey! Just like i love Ghatotkacha, similarly you also love me
 tatpashchaat vir barbaric ne shri krishna se poocha— he prabhu! is jivan kaa sarvottam upyog kya he? vir barbaric ke is nishtol prashn ko sunate hi shri krishna ne kaha— he putr, is jivan kaa sarvottam upyog, paroapkaar va nirbal kaa saathi banakar sadaiv dharm kaa saath dene se he
 For which you will have to earn strength and powers
 atev tum mahisagar kshetra main navadurga kii aradhana kar shaktiyaan arjan karo
 At the behest of Shri Krishna, child Barbarik bowed to God
 shri krishna ne unke saral hriday ko dekhakar vir barbaric ko "suhriday" naam se alankrita kiya
 After that Barbarik, having acquired all the weapons and knowledge, worshiped Navadurga for 3 years in the Mahisagar region, pleased with true devotion and austerity, Bhagwati Jagadamba appeared in front of Veer Barbarik and gave him three arrows and many powers, so that the three worlds Could be conquered
 yahan unhen "chandil" naam mila
 Maa Jagadamba was intrusted by instructing Veer Barbarik to complete the accomplishment of a Brahmin named Vijay, his supreme devotee in the same area
 jab vijay brahman kaa aagaman hua to vir barbaric ne pingal, repalendra, duhadruha tathaa nau koti mansabhakshi palasi rakshason ke janglerupi samooh ko agni kii bhanti bhasma karke unka yajna sampoorn karaayaa
 On completion of the Yagna of that Brahmin, the god-goddess Veer was very pleased with Barbarik and appeared and bestowed the illustrious powers of Yajna
 ek baar kii baat he barbaric ne prithvi or pataal ke bich raste main naag kanyaon kaa varan prastaav yah kahkar thukraa diya ki unhone aaajeevan brahmacharee rahane kaa pran liya he
 At the commencement of the Mahabharata war, Veer Barbarik expressed his desire to participate in the war in front of his mother Morvi
 tab mata ne inhen yuddh main bhaag lene kii ajna is vachan ke saath di kii tum yuddh main haarane vaale paksh kaa saath nibhaaoge
 When Veer went to participate in the Barbaric war, Lord Krishna, before the Mahabharata war, because of the low curse received by Brahma ji of his former birth and thinking that if the Veer would participate in the Barbaric war, the Kauravas would end the Mahabharata in just 18 days
 Cannot be in war and defeat of Pandavas will be sure
 aisa sochakar shri krishna ne vir barbaric kaa shirochhedan kar mahabharat yuddh se vanchit kar diya
 As he did this, a wave of mourning ran in the battlefield, 14 goddesses immediately appeared in the battlefield
 deviyon ne vir barbaric ke purv janm ko brahma ji dwaara praapt shraap kaa rahasyodghatan sabhi upasthit yoddhaon ke samaksh nimna prakaar kiya— The ladies said: "before the beginning of Dwaparyuga, distressed by the tyranny of the Moore monster, Prithvi appeared in his cow form and spoke in the House of Gods," o Gods! i am able to bear all kinds of anguish

 You protect me from this misdeed, i have come to your shelter
 ” Listening to the pitiful call of Gauswarupa Dhara, there was complete silence in the whole assembly
 thodi der ke maun ke pashchaat brahma ji ne kaha— “ab to isse chhutkaaraa paane kaa ek maatr upaay yahi he ki ham sabhi ko bhagavan vishnu kii sharan main chalanaa chahie or prithvi ke is sankat nivaaran hetu unase prarthana kerani chahie

 You will surely get its punishment
 apane aap ko vishnu ji se shreshth samajhane vaale agyani! tum is devsabha se abhi prithvi par ja giroge
 You will be born in a demon's vagina and when there will be a fierce crusade on earth in the last phase of Dwaparyug only then your head will be by Lord Vishnu himself and you will be a demon forever
 " With this curse of Brahmaji, the false pride of Yaksharaj Suryavarcha also crumbled
 vah tatkaal brahma ji ke charnon main gir padaa or vinamr bhav se bolaa— “bhagwan! bhulvash nikle in shabdon ke liye mujhe kshamaa kar dijie main aapke sharnaagat hoon

 Yes, i can make amends in this that Lord Krishna himself will dissect you with his Sudarshan Chakra, your head will be attested by the ladies

 jab shri krishna ne unase unke sheesh kii maang kii to unhone apana sheesh bina kisi jhijak ke unako arpit kar diya or bhakt unhen sheesh ke dani ke naam se pukaarane lage
 Shri Krishna wanted to make the Pandavas victorious in the war
 barbaric pehle hi apni maan ko haare hue kaa saath dene kaa vachan de chuke the or yuddh ke pehle ek vir purush ke sir kii bhent yubhumipujan ke liye kerani thi isliye shri krishna ne unase sheesh kaa daan maanga
 Devotees believe that if something is asked from Baba, then Baba gives it millions of times, that is why he is also known as Lakhdatar
 jaisaa ki is aalekh me bataaya gaya he baba ne haarane vaale paksh kaa saath dene kaa pran liya tha, isiilie baba ko haare kaa sahaara bhi kaha jaataa he
 Only because of the pledge to fight on behalf of the loser and the order from Grandmother Hidimba
 bhagwaan shri krishna kii man main uthi samasya ke kaaran hi barbaric va baba ke sheesh ko bhagwaan vasudev dwaara maanga gaya
 Because one Kuru army could not be finished before eighteen days
 tathaa anya tathy yah tha ki mahabali barbaric haare hue kamjor kii taraf se yuddh karte is liye ant main mahabali barbaric ke ilaava koi nahi bachataa
 Because from which side he fought, the front would become weak
 phir apni pratigya anusaar unhen haare hue kii taraf se yuddh karnaa hota
 So in the end only Mahabali Barbarik would have survived
 baba hameshaa mayur ke pankhons kii bani hui chadi rakhte hai isliye inhen morchadi vaala bhi kehete hai
 The character of Veerwar Morveenandan Shri Barbarik ji is elaborated in the "second subdivision 'qomarik Khand' under Maheshwar Khand" in Skanda Purana
