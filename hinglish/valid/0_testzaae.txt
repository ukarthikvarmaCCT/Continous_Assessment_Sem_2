 Sewage treatment, or domestic wastewater treatment, is the process of removing both effluent and domestic wastewater and contaminated materials from domestic sewage
 isamen bhautik, rasinic or jaivik sandooshit padaarthon ko hataane kii bhautik, rasinic or jaivik prakriyaayein shaamil hai
 Its purpose is to produce a waste stream and a solid waste or sludge that is suitable for discharge or reuse in the atmosphere
 yah saamagree aksar anjaane main kai vishakt carbonic or acarbonic yogicon se sandooshit ho jaati he
 Sewage originates from residential, institutional and commercial and industrial establishments and includes household waste fluids from toilets, bathrooms, showers, kitchens, bathrooms, etc
 which are discharged through sewage drains
 kai kshetron ke malajal main udyog or vaanijya se nikalne vaale apshisht taral padaarth bhi shaamil hote hai
 Isolation and drainage of domestic waste in the form of gray water and black water is becoming very common in today's developed world, and gray water is being used to water plants or toilets to clean them
 They are being recycled for adhikansh malajal main chhaton yaa gaadi khadi karne kii jagahon se nikalne vaale satahi jal bhi shaamil hote hai or inamen apwaahi tufaani jal bhi ho saktaa he
 Sewage drainage systems capable of handling stormwater are known as combined systems or combined sewage drains
 aisi pranaaliyon se aamtaur par parhez kiya jaataa he kyonki apni mausamipan kii vajah se ye pranaliyaan malajal prashodhan ke kaary ko jatil bana detii hai or is tarah malajal prashodhan sanyantron kii kshamta ko gata detii hai
 Due to flow variability, treatment facilities often become larger than necessary and later more expensive
 iske alaava, prashodhan sanyantr kii kshamta se adhik jal pravaah pradaan karne vaale baari tufaanon se malajal prashodhan pranali par bahut zyada prabhaav pad saktaa he jisase jal chhalkaav yaa atipravaah kii samasya utpann ho jaati he
 Under the modern sewage drain development, the trend of providing separate stormwater drainage systems for rainwater is being adopted
 chunki varsha kaa jal chaatro ke upar or jameen par bahata he, isliye yah apane saath mitti ke kan evam anya talachat, baari dhaatu, carbonic yogic, jaanwaron kaa apshisht padaarth or tel evam ongan sahit vibhinn sandooshit padaarthon ko bhi le jaataa he
 In some areas, it is necessary to undergo some level of treatment before expelling the stormwater directly into the waterways
 tufaani jal ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale prashodhan kii prakriyaaon ke udaahranon main avsaadan basin, geeli jameen, vibhinn prakaar ke nispandan yukt evam antarveshit thos gumbaj or chakrakaar vibhaajak shaamil hai
 Separate sanitary drains should not contain any storm water
 swatchta naaliyaan aam taur par tufaani naaliyon kii tulana main bahut choti hoti he or inhen tufaani jal ko le jane ke liye banaaya nahin gaya hai
 If excess stormwater is discharged into the sanitary drainage system in low-lying areas, there may be an accumulation of unrefined sewage
 malajal kaa prashodhan usee jagah ke aasapaas kiya ja saktaa he jahaan yah utpann hota he, yaa inhen pipon ke ek network or pump steshnon ke jariye sangrahit karke nagarpalika ke prashodhan sanyantr tak pahunchaaya ja saktaa he 
 Sewage collection and treatment is generally subject to local, state and federal regulations and standards
 audyogic pratishthanon se nikalne vaale apshisht jal ke liye aksar vishesh prashodhan prakriyaaon kii jarurat padati he 
 Traditional sewage treatment can consist of three stages, called primary, secondary and tertiary treatment
 praathmik prashodhan ke tahat malajal ko asthaayee taur par ek supt basin main rakhaa jaataa he jahaan baari thos padaarth neeche jaakar jam jaae jabaki tel, ongan or halke thos padaarth sataha par tairte rahe
 Substances below and floating above are removed and the remaining fluid may be expelled or used in secondary treatment
 dwitiyak prashodhan ghule hue or prasupt jaivik padaarthon ko hataata he
 Secondary treatment is usually carried out by indigenous, water-borne micro-organisms in a managed location
 dwitiyak prashodhan ke tahat prashodhit jal ko nishkasit karne yaa tritiyak prashodhan main istemaal karne se pehle isamen se sookshm jeevon ko hataane ke liye ek algaav prakriya kii jarurat pad sakati he
 Tertiary treatment is sometimes considered to be slightly higher than primary and secondary treatment
 prashodhit jal ko kisi jaldhara, nadi, khadi, lagoon yaa geeli jameen main mukt karne se pehle ise kabhi-kabhi rasinic yaa bhautik rup se keetanushunya kiya jaataa he, yaa ise kisi golf ke maidan, hare-bhare raste yaa park kii sinchai ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 If it is sufficiently clean, it can also be used for groundwater recharge or agricultural purposes
 purv-prashodhan ke tahat praathmik prashodhan ke nirmalakari pampon or jharniyon ko kshatigrast yaa baadhit karne vaale samagriyon ko hataata he jinhen aasaani se aprishkrut apshisht jal se ekatra kiya ja saktaa he
 The effluent sewage is filtered to remove all the large objects flowing in the sewage stream
 is kaam ko zyaadaatar aam taur par bahut badi jansankhya ko seva pradaan karne vaale aadhunik sanyantron main ek swachaalit yantravat sanchedaar avarohak chanani kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he jabaki apekshaakrit chote yaa kam aadhunik sanyantron main ek hastchalit saafe chanani kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The aggregation action of a mechanical inhibitory filter is usually based on a slow rate of deposition and / or flow rate on the inhibitor filter
 thos padaarthon ko ekatra kar liya jaataa he or baad main kisi bhumibharav ke kaam main istemaal kiya jaataa he yaa jalaakar raakh kar diya jaataa he
 Different sizes of inhibitor filtering or mesh filtering may be used to optimize the removal of solids
 chaanan kii kriya kisi bhi malajal prashodhan sanyantr main kiya jane vaala sabase pehla kaary he, jiske tahat malajal ko vibhinn prakaar kii chanani se hokar pravaahit kiya jaataa he, jisase ki malajal main maujuud kapadon ke tukaden, kagaz, lakdi, rasoi kaa kooda-karkat ityadi jaise jal ke upar bahane vaale padaarthon ko fansaaya or hataaya ja sake
 If these flowing materials are not removed, they will jam the pipes or adversely affect the work of sewage pumps
 Thus, the main purpose of making the filter available is to protect the pumps and other equipment from the possible damages caused by the effluents flowing into the sewage
 ise kankad kakshon se aage sthapit kiya janaa chahie
 But if the quality of the pebbles does not matter as much as in the case of land filling, then these filters can be placed after the pebble chambers
 inhen kabhi-kabhi khud kankad kakshon ke mukhya bhaag main bhi samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 Pre-treatment may contain a sand or pebble channel or chamber where the velocity of incoming wastewater is adjusted for the deposition of sand, pebbles and stones
 in kanon ko isliye hataa diya jaataa he kyonki ye apshisht jal prashodhan centre ke pampon or anya yantric upkarnon ko kshatigrast kar sakate hai
 Pebble chambers may not be required for small sanitary sewage systems, but pebble removal is desirable in large plants
 praathmik avsaadan charan main, malajal badi-badi tankiyon se hokar bahata he jise aamtaur par "praathmik nirmalak" yaa "praathmik avsaadan tank" kehete hai
 These tanks are used for the deposition of sludge, while the oil and oil rise to the surface and are removed from the top
 praathmik jamaav tankiyaan aamtaur par yantric rup se sanchalit scraper se susajjit hoti hai jo ekatrit keechad ko lagaataar tank ke aadhaar tal main sthit ek hoper kii taraf le jaataa he jahaan se ise keechad prashodhan kendron main bhej diya jaataa he
 For saponification, oil and oil are sometimes removed from the flowing materials
 in tankiyon ke ayaamon kaa nirmaan is tarah se kiya janaa chahie jo behate hue padaarthon or keechad kii atyadhik maatra ko hataane kii kriya main sahaayak siddh ho
 a typical sedimentation tank can remove 60 to 65 percent of the suspended solids content of the sewage and 30 to 35 percent of the BOD
 dwitiyak prashodhan kaa nirmaan maanav apshisht, khaadya apshisht, sabun or disergent se utpann malajal ke jaivik padaarth ko kaaphi had tak kam karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 Most of the municipal plants treat the frozen chemicals in sewage using pneumatic biological processes
 kriyasheel bane rahane or jivit rahane ke liye jeev jagat ke liye oxigen or khaadya donon jaruri he
 Bacteria and protozoa consume naturally decomposable soluble organic contaminants and convert most of the less soluble substances into floc
 dwitiyak prashodhan pranaaliyon ko nimna roopon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he The treatment process of a fixed film or enclosed growth system consists of a leak filter and a recurring biological mixer where the biomass forms the medium and the sewage passes over its surface
 prasupt-vruddhi pranaaliyon main, jaise utprerit keechad, jaev padaarth malajal se mil jaataa he or ek samaan pariman vaale jal ko prashodhit karne vaale niyat film pranaaliyon kii tulana main ek chote sthaan main yah sanchalit ho saktaa he
 Fixed-film systems, however, are more capable of withstanding strong changes in the amount of organic matter and can remove more organic matter and suspended solids than suspended growth systems

 "sampatti" shabd ke kai arth ho sakate hai yatha swaamitv yaa swatv, arthath swami ko praapt sampurna adhikaar
 Sometimes it means the Roman "race" under which the right of ownership is exercised under which the right of ownership is exercised, ie the object itself which is the subject or character of the said right
 "res" athwa "vastu" kaa maanav se sambadh bataanevaala arth sampatti ke swaroop ke vikaas main sahaayak hua he
 Thus the sense of authority over "race" or "object" and the affirmation of "race" or "object" itself are complex and intimately related to the affinity suffix, ie both are complementary and supportive of each other
 roman main "res" kaa arth atyant jatil he
 It is a solid object of authority like English
 kintu "res" kaa thik thik arth "vastu" ke bilkul samaan nahin he, usase kuch adhik he
 Although the original meaning of "race" is a physical object, it was gradually used to express an asset that could be not only physical and physical but also intangible such as electricity
 "res" kaa prayog vishishtadhikaar ke liye bhi hota he or aise adhikaron ke liye bhi jo, udaahranarth, prasiddhi yaa khyaati se utpann hote hai
 Thus, due to the frequent use of race for these two meanings, "race" has two meanings: "race earth" means material things which can come under the rights of human beings and "race inactive" means those rights themselves
 is prakaar antim vishleshan ke falswaroop "vastu" kaa aashay "res parthiv" se hi liya jayega
 In Roman language "race" is used for both property and possession of property, but the word "sow", which is used for goods or money, is equivalent to the word "wealth" in Sanskrit
 arabi juriyon ke anusaar "maal" shabd sampatti tathaa kisi bhi aisi vastu ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he jiskaa arabi kanoon main mulya yaa arth ho athwa jo kisi vyakti ke adhikaar main rah sakati ho
 The word "money" is also often used for property
 sampatti ke arth main prayukt honevaali vastu main sthayitv kaa tathaa bhautik ekatv kaa gun hona aavashyak he
 a collection of units whose units are themselves separate objects and an object made up of the inclusion of such single units can also be called objects; Such as a house made of brick or bricks or a sheep or a hut made of many sheep
 kanoon main vastu kaa prayog kuch adhikaron evam kartavyon ko vyakt karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Depending on physical properties, an "object" can be of two types - movable or immovable
 lekin agreji kanoon ke takneekee niyamon ke anusaar vastu, vaastavik tathaa vyaktigat hoti he
 According to Roman law, "race" is similarly divided into "mansepebul" and unmanciple
 is prakaar sampatti ek or "res" yaa "vastu" or duusari ore res athwa vastu se sambandhit manushya ke adhikaron se sambhddha he
 Therefore, a person is required for the property, who can hold his authority over something
 antim vishleshan ke anusaar sampatti, ek vyakti or ek vastu yaa adhikaar, jise vah keval apana maanata ho, ke madhya sthapit sambadh ko vyakt karti he
 In its modern experiments property is used for all goods or property which belongs to a person or has been dedicated to another person but reserves the right to arrange that item for their benefit
 res yaa vastu ke parthiv or aparthiv vargeekaran tathaa vastu yaa adhikaron ke swaroop ke anusaar sampatti kaa vargeekaran vibhinn prakaar se hua he jaise, parthiv yaa aparthiv; chal yaa achal tathaa vaastavik yaa vyaktigat
 Joint taxation of property with other specific terms such as personal or public, paternal, liable, joint family, unofficial, etc
 expresses a relationship with the nature of the property
 sampatti kii vaidhanik vyakhya ke anusaar iske kai arth he
 The property also bears the fruits of physical and mental exertion done by a person
 koi bhi vyakti apni kisi vastu ke badale main jo kuch bhi paata he, jo kuch bhi use diya jaataa he or jise kanoon dwaara us vyakti kaa mana jaataa he athwa use prayog karne, bhoga karne tathaa vyavastha karne kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya jaataa he, vah sab us vyakti kii vyaktigat sampatti kehalaati he
 But if it is not recognized by law, it cannot be called property and then there is no relation between the person and the object in terms of legal consequences
 rawal ratnasingh chittod ke shaasha the
 His reign was short-lived
 bappa rawal ke vansh main samar singh ke do putron main ratnasingh ek yogya parakramee shaasha tha, ratna singh ke bhai kumbhakarna pehle se hi mewar ko chhodkar nepal palaayan kar gaye, is kaaran ratan singh shaasha bane jo rawal shakha ke antim shaasha the | Seated on the throne of Chittor in the very early years of the fourteenth century
 inaki vishesh khyaati hindi ke mahakavy padmavat main raja ratansen ke naam se rahi he
 Some historians believe his ascension in 1301 AD and some in 1302 AD
 inaki patni itihaas-prasiddh rani padmini yaa padmavati thi
 These were destroyed along with the family and the government in 1303 AD by the invasion of Alauddin Khilji
 praayah 1 varsh kaa hi shashan kaal hone tathaa inke saath hi inke vansh kaa ant ho jane se pashchaatkaaleen bhaaton-chaarnon kii gaathaon main inkaa naam hi lupt ho gaya tha
 Even being based mainly on these sources, they have not even been named in Colonel Tod's famous Rajasthani treatise
 unke sthaan par atyant bhraamak rup se bhimsingh se inaki patni rani padmini kaa sambandh joda gaya he
 Renowned historian Mahamahopadhyay Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha proved the historicity of Rawal Ratnasinh while clarifying Colonel Tod's mistake
 ojha ji ne sari bhrantiyaan tathaa sachai spasht karte hue likhaa he ki "rawal summersingh ke peeche uskaa putr ratnasingh chittod kii gaddi par baitha
 It was only a few months before he ruled, so Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khilji attacked Chittor and after fighting for more than six months, he took the fort
 mewar ke kuch khyaton, rajprashasti, mahakavy or karnal tod ke rajasthan main to ratnasingh kaa naam tak nahin diya
 Karan Singh is written to be the king after Samarsingh, but Karansingh is not after Samarsingh, but it was 8 generations before that
 muhanot nanasi apni khyath main likhata he ki ratansi padmani ke maamle main allaudin se ladakar kaam aayaa; parantu vah ratnasingh ko ek jagah to samarsi kaa putr or duusari jagah ajaisi kaa putr or bhadlakhamasi kaa bhai batalaata he, jisamen se pichhlaa kathan vishwaas-yogya nahin he, kyonki lakhamasi ajaisi kaa putr nahin kintu pita or sisode kaa sardaar tha
 Thus Ratnasinh was not the brother of Lakhmsi but the lord of Mewar and the son of Samarsingh, as found in the inscription and Ekalingamahatmya of Kumbhalgarh dated 1517, around the time of Rana Kumbhakarna
 in donon main yah bhi likhaa he ki summersingh ke peeche uskaa putr ratnasingh raja hua
 When he was killed, Lakshman Singh was killed, along with his seven sons, by destroying the Mlechchas for the protection of Chittor
 " No details are available regarding Ratnasinh more than the ancient inscriptions etc
 allaudin khilji ke akraman se sambaddh vivaran amir khusro ke 'tarikhe alaai' main miltaa he
 The above book by Amir Khusro shows that Sultan Alauddin Khilji left Delhi to take Chittor on 28 January 1303 AD and the fort was conquered on 26 August 1303 AD
 allaudin khilji ke akraman ke sambandh main mahakavi malik mohammad jaaysi ne apane suprasiddh mahakavy padmavat main likhaa he ki yah akraman raja ratansen kii adwitiya sundari patni padmavati ko praapt karne ke liye hua tha or anek varshon tak gheraa daalane ke baad asafal hokar khilji laut gaya tha tathaa dubaara akraman karke vijayi hua tha
 But now with the historical facts coming out, historians have started to believe that the main reason for the invasion was the imperial ambition of Alauddin and the military and commercial utility of Chittor
 gujarat, malwa, madhya pradesh, sanyukt praant, sindh aadi bhaagon ke vyapaarik maarg chittod se hokar guzarate the
 It is natural that an ambitious Sultan like Alauddin Khilji would like to authorize it
 yah sambhav he ki padmini kii sundarataa jaanakar uskaa ek uddeshy use praapt karnaa bhi ho gaya ho
 Whatever be the reason, but Alauddin's invasion destroyed the life of Rawal Ratnasinh along with the rule and Rani Padmini, along with her majority friends and other queens, became Sati by doing Jauhar

 It has two parts: pre-constitution and New Testament
 bible kaa purvardh arthath purvavidhan yahudiyon kaa bhi dharmagranth he
 The Bible is God inspired but it cannot be called unconquerable
 ishwar ne bible ke vibhinn lekhakon ko is prakaar prerit kiya he ki ve ishvarkrut hote hue bhi unki apni rachanaayen bhi kahi ja sakati hai
 God did not speak and wrote the Bible to them

 Therefore, the Bible is a combined result of both divine inspiration and human labor

 The Bible is not a compilation of esoteric philosophical truths, rather it shows what God has arranged for the salvation of mankind
 vastav main bible ishwariya muktividhan ke karyanvayan kaa itihaas he jo old testament main prarambh hokar isa ke dwaara new testament main sampadit hua he
 So, there is a close relationship between the two parts of the Bible
 old testament kii ghatnaon dwaara isa ke jivan kii ghatnaon kii prishthbhumi taiyaar kii gai he
 The New Testament shows how liberation is accomplished by Jesus' personality, miracles, education, death and resurrection; How did Jesus establish the church and how has this church looked at the events of Jesus' life in its early development to see what conclusions have been drawn from them

 Out of the above list of biblical texts, some of the Old Testament texts were not included in the Hebrew Bible, namely Tobias, Yudith, Macabi, Pragya Sirah, and parts of Daniel and Esther

 Recently, until the release of the DVD The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA, interviews between Hogan and Gagné showed that there was still hostility between the two sides, negating the possibility that the AWA by actual ownership
 Hogan's rule on the title would have been accepted
 WWE won a legal suit against Dale Gagnar, due to trademark infringement, which falsified Gagné's claim on AWA and thus made the proposal controversial because WWE gave Hulk Hogan only twelve US titles Approves and does not include the AWA world title

 Then they will suddenly experience another wind, being "nourished" by the energy of the audience, and then become impenetrable to the attack — a process described as "hulking up"

 Hogan was to face Sting for the WCW World Heavyweight Title on October 24 at Halloween Havok
 haalanki hogan saamaanya poshaak pahanakar ring main aae, pin ke liye jhuke or ring se chale gaye
 Soon after his return in February 2000, on July 9 at Bash at the Beach, Hogan was involved in a disputed, spontaneous incident with Vince Russo
 hogan ko WCW veshv heviveet khitaab ke liye jeff jaret se ladane ke liye anusuchit kiya gaya tha
 Before the match, there was a dispute between Hogan and Russo
 hogan kii jaankaree ke bina ruso ne jaret se ring ke bich let jane ko kaha or hogan ko sidhe unhen jhukaane kaa aadesh diya
 Seemingly confused, Hogan obeyed the order and placed his foot on Jarrett's chest and said to Russo, "was that your idea, Russo 


?" It's recent! " Russo came out and responded by saying, "I haven't done anything since day one, since I'm at WCW
 

kuch bhi nahin


keval parde ke peeche jari tuchh raajnneeti se nipat rahaa hum
" chunki hogan ne jaret ko haraane kaa kaary karne se manaa kar diya tha, isliye ek nayaa WCW vishwa heviveet khitaab nirmit kiya gaya, jisase baad main us raat bukar tii or jeff jaret ke bich hue khitaabi mukaable ke liye manch taiyaar hua
 There was a heated debate over whether the entire incident was a scene or real
 parinamswaroop, hogan ne kuch hi samay baad ruso ke khilaaf charitra-hanan kaa ek kanoonee mukadmaa daayar kar diya, jo antat 2002 main khaarij ho gaya
 Russo claims that the entire incident was real and Hogan claims that Russo made it a scene
 erik bishuf ne yah likhte hue katha ke hogan vaale paksh se sahmati vyakt kii ki hogan kaa jeetna or khitaab ko lekar chale janaa vaastavik tha or ghatana ke baad unhone va hogan ne angel kii jeet kaa jashn manaaya tha, lekin ruso kaa baahar aakar hogan par barasana ek aniojit drishy tha, jiske baad hogan ne kanoonee mukadmaa daayar kiya
 Finally in the months following the postponement of WCW in March 2001, Hogan underwent surgery on his knees to wrestle again
 As a test, Hogan joined a match in Orlando, Florida in a campaign run by his old manager Jimmy Hart for the x Wrestling Federation
 In this match, Hogan defeated Kurt Henning and felt himself fit to return to the WWF in February 2002

 After returning as the original nwo leader with Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, the trio got into a confrontation with The Rock and in the main event gave Stone Cold Steve Austin the chance to become the undisputed winner of the WWF against Chris Jericho
 nwo kaa austin or da rock, donon ke saath vivaad hua or hogan ne resalmenia X8 main muqabla karne kii da rock kii chunauti sweekaar kii
 At this event, with a desire to defeat The Rock alone, Hogan asked Hall and Nash not to interfere
 Despite the fact that Hogan was intended to be the villain in the bout, Hogan was favored by the crowd throughout the event, effectively changing his image
 da rock ne spasht rup se pratiyogita jeet lee lekin mukaable ke ant main hogan se mitrataa kar lee or haul va naish se ladane main unki sahaayta kii, jo hogan ke samjhautavaadi drushtikon ke kaaran naaraaz the

 They speak their own separate Sakha language, a dialect of the northern subdivision of the Siberian branch of Turkish languages
 kuch yakuut log saakhaa ganatantr se baahar rus ke amur, magadan va sakhalin kshetron main or taimir va avenk swashasit kshetron main bhi rahete hai
 In the 2002 census, a population of about four and a half lakh people were living in Sakha Republic
 soviet sangh ke jamaane main inke ilaake main bahut se roosi log aa based jis se inkaa un kshetron main pratishat-hissaa ghat gaya lekin soviet vyavastha tuutane ke baad yah zaraa-bahut badha he
 The Yakut people are divided into two groups according to geography and economy
 uttari yakuut shikaar, machhlee pakadaney or rangifer-paalan se jeevani chalate hai, jabaki dakshini yakuut gaay or ghodon kaa maveshi-paalan karte hai
 The Yakut people initially lived on the Baykal Lake area and Olkhon Island located in that lake
 13veen sadi main mongol samrajya ubhara or unke dabaav se yakuuton ke purvaj madhya lenaa nadi, aldaan nadi or wilyuy nadi ke kshetra main chale aae

 uttari yakuut shikaar, machhlee pakadaney or rangifer paalan karne lage lekin dakshini yakuut apane purvajon kii tarah gaay or ghodon kaa paalan karte rahe
 The territory of Russia began to expand in the 1620s
 usne yakuton par pashu-khaal lene kaa kar lagaaya or 1634 se lekar 1642 kaal main kai yakuut vidrohon ko kuchlaa
 The rent of cattle and animals was called 'yesak'
 roosi krurta or yasak se pareshaan hokar yakuton or lenaa nadi ke kinare based tungusi logon ne 1642 main bada vidroh kiya
 Peter Golovin, the leader of the Russian forces, ruthlessly crushed it and then began to rule with terror
 yakuut gaanvon ko jala diya gaya or sainkadon logon ko petakar or yatnaayen dekar hatyaayein kii
 As a result, about 70% of the Yakuts died during the period 1642 to 1682
 iske baad yahan sona milane or paar-siberian railmarg banane se badi taadaad main roosi log yahan aane lage
 By the 1820s, almost all Yakuts had been converted into Russian traditional Christians, although many of the beliefs of the Ojha religion remained in their society and remain intact till date
 soviet sangh banane ke baad, 1919 main is kshetra ko 'yakuut swashasit soviet samaajawaadee ganatantr' ke naam se gathit kiya gaya, lekin 1921-1923 kaal main ek yakuut vidroh hua
 Under the dictator of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, the yakuts were forced into forced mass agriculture and cattle rearing and were also employed under the Gulag system
 is dalan se bhi bahut se yakuut jaane kho baithe or inaki jansankhya 1960 tak pehle se kam hi rahi

 Such as sub = 2 quantity and word = 3 quantity
 isi prakaar shilp, kalp anya, dhanya, mantra, aadi sabhi 3 maatra vaale shabd hai
 It is worth noting here that if the two consonants come first and join the vowel, then the volume of the vowel will be counted as ॰ Trishul = 4, Tri = 1, Shu = 2, l = 1, Forgiveness = 3, Forgiveness = 3, Kshatrani = 5, enemy = 3, fickle = 4, low = 3, decor = 4, truth = 3, always = 3, plain = 4, like = 4, crow = 4, etc
