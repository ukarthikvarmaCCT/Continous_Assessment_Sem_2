 The journey usually takes two days
 lekin agar koi samasya aa gai yaa mausam bighad gaya to zyada samay bhi lag saktaa he
 Travelers often stop at Jispa or Sarchu at night
 haalaanki kelong, daarchaa or pang main bhi bahut shandaar rukne kaa intjaam hota he
 Most travelers come in May and June
 zyaadaatar bhartiya yatri rohtang darra dekhakar hi manali laut jate hai
 Rohtang Pass is covered with snow even in summer
 basen manali se subah chaar baje hi chalanaa shuru ho jaati he or niyamit antaraal par dopaher baarah baje tak chalati rahati hai
 These buses mostly go to Keylong
 manali se kelong tak amuman chah ghante lagate hai
 But due to jams, bad weather, snowfall etc
 on the Beas drain in Marhi, more time is also taken
 agar aapako rohtang darra paar karke lahaul main utarana he to salaah di jaati he ki subah aath baje se pehle rohtang paar ho janaa chahie
 Apart from buses on the route, there are also share taxis but they are mostly filled with locals
 iske alaava share taxi main baahar ke drishy bhi utane achche nahin dikhte jisase yatra kaa majaa kirkira ho jaataa he
 Secondly, they do not stop everywhere

 iske kaaran saans lene main pareshaani hoti hai
 Apart from this, headache, nausea, dizziness and vomiting are also common
 bahut se log is pareshaani se guzarate hai

 Among the Dharmasutras, there is a law for varnashram-dharma, personal conduct, duties of the king and subjects etc
 ye grihyasutron kii shrunkhlaa ke rup main hi uplabdh hote hai
 Like the Shrutasutras, it is believed that the Dharmasutras of each branch were also separate
 vartmaan samay main sabhi shakhaon ke dharmasutra uplabdh nahin hote
 One of the reasons for this unavailability is that the entire ancient volume is not present before us today
 uskaa ek bada bhaag kaalakwalit ho gaya
 The second reason for this is that the separate dharmasutras of all the branches were probably not practiced, because only the dharmasutras of any other branch were adopted by these branches
 purvamimasaa main kumaril bhatta ne bhi aisa hi sanket diya he
 The customs of the Aryans were based on the ancient scriptures, but by the time of the Sutra period, there had been substantial changes and progress in these customs, social institutions and political situations, hence the need to rule them was felt
 saamaajik vikaas ke saath hi uthi samasyaayen bhi pratidin jatil hoti ja rahi thim
 Many Vedic branches took over the task of resolving them, which resulted in extensive deliberations
 in sutaragranthon ne is dirghakaalin bauddhik smapda ko sutron ke madhyam se surakshit rakhaa, iskaa pramaan in sutaragranthon main uddhrut anek pracheen aacharyon ke mat-matantaron ke rup main miltaa he
 This was a sequence of development which was continuously happening due to the immediate situation
 yah vikascram yaheen par nahin rukaa apitu sutaragranthon main bhi samyaanukool parivartan evam parivardhan kiya gaya jiske falswaroop hi parvarti smritiyon kaa janm hua
 New problems continued to emerge
 unke samaadhanarth smritiyon par bhi bhashya evam tikaayen likhi gayin jinke madhyam se pracheen vachanon kii naveen vyakhyaayein kii gayin
 Thus paving the way for the timely rendering of new principles and rules without abandoning the previous premise
 jaisaa ki naam se hi vidit he ki dharmasutron main vyakti ke dharmasambandhi kriyakalapon par vichaar kiya gaya he, kintu dharmasutron main pratipaadit dharm kisi vishesh puja-paddati par ashrith na hokar samast aacharan va vyavhaar par vichaar karte hue sampoorn maanavjivan kaa hi niyantrak he
 The use of the word 'religion' is becoming abundant in the Vedic codes and their later literature
 yahan par yah avadhey he ki parvarti sahitya main dharm shabd kaa vah arth drushtigochar nahin hota, jo ki vaidic samhitaon main uplabdh he
 The word dharma is used in a wide sense in the codes
 atharvaveda main pruthivi ke gyaarah dharak tattvon kii gananaa ‘pruthivin sdharyanti’ kahkar kii gayi he
 Similarly, in the Vedas * the same sentiment has been expressed by saying 'tani Dharmani Prathamanyasana'
 is prakaar yah dharm kisi deshavishesh tathaa kalvishesh se sambandhit na hokar aise tatwon ko pariganit karata he jo samast pruthivi athwa uske nivaasiyon ko dhaaran karte hai
 Those rules are eternal and unavoidable for all
 maxmooler ne bhi dharm ke is swaroop kii ore in shabdon main ingit kiya he- pracheen bharatvasiyon ke liye dharm sabase pehle anek vishyon ke bich ek ruchi kaa vishay nahin tha apitu vah sabakaa aatmasamarpan karaane vaali vidhi thi
 Under this, not only worship and prayer came but also all that we call philosophy, morality, law and governance
 unka sampoorn jivan unke liye dharm tha tathaa duusari chijen maanon is jivan kii bhautik aavashyaktaaon ke liye nimitt maatr thim
 In the later literature of the Samhita, religion remained confined only to the ethics and activities of Varnashrama
 upanishit-kaal main dharm kaa yahi swaroop uplabdh hota he
 Three Wands of Religion are counted in the Chandogya Upanishad *
 inamen yajna, adhyayan tathaa daan pratham, tap dwitiya tathaa acharyakul main vaas tritiy skandh he
 It is clear that religion became embedded in the classes under them and religion was also included in their later period
 itnaa hone par bhi sabhi ne dharm kaa mul veda ko mana jaataa he
 Manu has declared the Vedas to be the origin of religion by declaring 'dharma Jigyasamanamanam Samanam Param Shruti:' and 'vedokhilo Dharmamoolam' in this subject
 * gautam dharmasutra main to prarambh main hi 'vedon dharmamoolam'
 * 'tadvidancha smritisheela' * This is said by the sources
 ye donon sutara manusmriti ke 'vedonkhilo dharmamoolam smritishile c tadwidam' shlokansh ke hi roopaantar maatr hai
 Similarly, in the Vasistha Dharmasutra *, by saying 'shrutismritvihito Dharma:', Shruti and Smriti are considered proof regarding religion
 boudhayan dharmasutra main shruti tathaa smriti ke atirikt shishtacharan ko bhi dharm kaa lakshan kahkar manusmriti main pratipaadit shruti, smriti tathaa shishtacharan ko hi sutara rup main nibaddh kiya he
 In this way, along with Shruti, memory and decorum were also included in the symptoms of religion
 darshanashastra main dharm kaa lakshya lok-paralok kii siddhi* kahkar atyant vyapak kar diya gaya tathaa ek prakaar se samast maanav-jivan ko hi iske dwaara niyantrit kar diya gaya
 The above symptom of Vaiseshika philosophy means that all life, every breath and moment of life should be used in such a way that the attainment of Abhyudaya and the destitute
 isamen hi apana tathaa dusron kaa kalyaan nihit he
 Religion does not constrain the powers and goals of human beings, rather he sees infinite power in human beings, on the basis of which human can achieve his goal
 abhyuday tathaa ni:shreyas kii siddhi naamak lakshya itnaa mahaan he ki isse baahar kuch bhi nahin he
 The possibilities of achieving it are inherent in humans
 is prakaar jivan ke prayek paksh par dharm vichaar karata he tathaa apni vyavastha detaa he
 Dharmasutras and memories are the proponents of this system
 dharmasutrakaron ne apane-apane granthon dwaara maanavjivan ko is prakaar niyantrit karne kaa ytn kiya ki jisase vah ukt donon lakshyon ko praapt kar sake
 The religious leaders have given their own system after considering every problem related to human life so that human life can be run systematically
 isiilie unhone varndharm, ashram-dharm, rajdharm, prajadharm, khanpan, paap, praayshchitt, jati-pratha, dayad, vivaah aadi prayek pramukh vishyon par uttam reeti se vivechan kiya
 Dharmasutras have great importance in terms of social life of a person
 manushya ek saamaajik praani he
 He has to follow his ethics, behavior, ethics etc
 while staying in the society
 samaaj kii drushti se apane aap ko niyantrit karnaa hota he
 a society cannot run because of its eagerness or lawlessness and immorality
 dharmasutron main vyakti ke saamaajik jivan ke sampadanarth niyam banaae gayi hai
 It is through those rules that the duties and rights of a person are controlled in society
 dharmasutron main samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ke parsparik aachaar-vyavhaar aadi kaa bhi kramik varnan rahata he tathaa vibhinn sthitiyon se guzarate hue vyakti ke kartavya evam adhikaron kaa bhi ullekh rahata he
 Sometimes the Dharmasutras seem to consider the propitious subjects of the Grihasuasutras, but this is only in a few places
 grihyasutron main pakyagya, vivaah, sanskaar, shraadh, madhupark aadi kaa varnan rahata he
 In this way, the Grihyasutras describe the customs and rules that govern a person's religious life, but the life of the person is not limited to religion only
 use saamaajik jivan bhi jeena hota he jahaan uski kuch saamaajik samasyaayen hoti hai, uske saamaajik evam naitik daayitv bhi hote hai jinke purna na karne par yaa unako todane par dand kaa vidhaan bhi kiya jaataa he
 The importance of the Dharmasutras is from the same point of view that these social and moral obligations and the non-fulfillment of these are punished by various types of punishments
 is prakaar dharmasutron kaa kshetra samaaj main vyaapt vividh virgon tathaa ashramon ke jivan or unki samasyaon tak vistrut he, jabaki grihyasutron kaa kshetra apni shakhaon ke antargat prachlit niyamon tathaa reeti-rivaajon tak hi simit he
 The importance of Dharmasutras is due to their subject-rendering
 saamaajik vyavastha kaa aadhaar varnashram-paddati he
 In the Dharmasutras, various subjects have been presented on the basis of varnashrama-system
 inamen varnon ke kartavyon tathaa adhikaron par paryaapt prakaash daalaa gaya he
 The religious leaders insist on ethics in the mind even in emergency
 ayogy tathaa dooshit vyakti se parigrah kaa sarvatha nishedh kiya gaya he
 The Dharmasutras also hold substantial importance from the point of view of duties of the varnas and ashrams
 dharmasutron ke kaal tak ashramon kaa mahatv paryaapt bad gaya tha at: dharmasutron main etadvishayak paryaapt nirdesh diye gayi hai
 All ashrams have their base as Grihastha Shram and its base is marriage
 dharmasutron main vivaah par paryaapt prakaash daalaa gaya he
 It is special here that in Ashtavidha marriages all the religious leaders neither adopted a sequence nor accepted the importance of their superiority
 pratolom vivaah kii sarvatra ninda kii gayi he
 It is a law to perform religious acts of husband and wife after marriage
 dhan-sampatti par donon kaa samaan rup se adhikaar mana gaya he
 The essential of Pancha Mahayagya and all the rites for the householder is given here
 dharmasutrakaar is baat se bhi bhaleebhanti parichit the ki maryaada-ulanghan se samaaj main varnsankarta utpann hoti he
 The religious leaders also gave recognition to the Varnasarak castes and determined their social status and by following the Varna system, the responsibility of stopping Varshankarasa was entrusted to the king
 gautam dharmasutra* main jatyutkarsh tathaa jatyapakarsh kaa siddhanth bhi pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 In this way by performing the diverse duties of varnashrama, all such subjects like Pathak, Mahapatak, Atonement, Bhikshabhyak, Shraddha, Marriage and their decisions, Witness, Judge, Crime, Punishment, Debt, Interest, birth-death-dispensation, women-religion etc
 But it has been considered in Dharmasutras, which are used in life
 dharmasutrakaron ne vyakti ke aachaar evam vyavhaar par bahut bal diya he
 Ethics is the basis of human beings; That is the element of religion, theologians knew this very well
 manusmriti main to aachaar par yahan tak bal diya gaya he ki use hi 'param dharm' kah diya gaya tathaa kaha gaya he ki acharbhrasht vyakti ko veda bhi pavitra nahin kar saktaa
 a similar idea is expressed in the Vasistha Dharmasutra *
 hamen dharm ko apane vyavhaar main utaarna chahie, na ki keval shabdamaatr main
 However, observance of virtue is absolutely unavoidable
 tabhi samaaj sthir rah saktaa he, kintu iske saath hi yah tathy bhi smaraneey he ki sadachaar kaa paalan atyant hi kathin kaary he
 Even after constant efforts, corruption is possible and some people deliberately commit anti-social and anti-scriptural behavior
 acharheenta kisi bhi kaaran se ho, aisa vyakti patit kehalaata he
 The religious leaders knew this very well
 ve yah bhi jaanate the ki aise vyakti ko duracharan athwa uske aparaadh kaa dand to milanaa hi chahie, kintu yadi vah man se apane paapakarm par paashchaatap karata he to pun: use shreshth banane kaa avasar pradaan karnaa chahie na ki sadaiv ke liye hi uske jivan ko andhkaarmay bana dena chahie
 For this purpose, the religious leaders have done many kinds of punishments and penalties for the misdemeanor so that the person can be cleansed
 dharmasutron kii drushti main apradhi vyakti ghrinaa kaa paatr nahin hai, balki vah sneh evam sahanubhuti kaa paatr he
 At the core of the belief of the religious leaders is karma principles, according to which any good deed done is not destroyed, but good and bad produces some fruit
 un karmon kaa fal chaahe isi janm main mil jaae, chaahe agle janm main, kintu vah milegaa avashya
 Therefore, both present and future births can be purified, this is the endeavor of the religious leaders
 achaarshastra ke mul main karmasiddhanth hi he
 This is the motivation to remove sin
 varnashram dharm ke saath hi dharmasutron main rajdharm kaa bhi gahan vivechan kiya gaya he
 The divine part is conceived in the king
 dharmasutron main raja ke kartavya, adhikaar evam samajavirohi tatwon ke liye dand-vyavastha par bhi vichaar kiya gaya he
 In the event of opposition to religion and meaning, the king should take the side of religion
 raja ke liye yuddhadi ke niyamon kaa ullekh bhi in granthon main kiya gaya he yatha brahman, peeth dikhaane vaala, bhoomi par baithne vaala ye avadhya kahe gayi hai
 In this way, the Dharmasutras present a general discussion of the major themes and teachings of Rajashastra
 is prakaar apane samay main varnashram ke kartavyon kaa nirdhaaran karke dharmasutrakaron ne samaaj ko uchit disha dene main mahatvapurn bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya he
 At the same time, by making a variety of atonement and punishment for crimes, he also tried to free the society from crime

 It seems that at that time, the religious leaders were engaged in controlling and restraining the society socially and ethically
 ek sabhy evam swasth samaaj ke liye yah anivaary tha
 Today many changes have taken place in society

 The form of education and institutions are not even those which were in ancient times

 Social and moral values have also changed to the foreground
 dayad tathaa sampatti-vibhaajan aadi ke liye bhi aaj raajnneetik kaanoon hi sarvamaanya hai, ityadi
 At such times, only the finite relevance of these dharmasutras can be considered
 gautam tathaa boudhayan aadi dharmasutron se hamen paryaapt maatra main bhugolic sanket bhi praapt hote hai, yatha boudhayan dharmasutra* main shishton ke desh kii seemaa batalaayi gayi he
 This is Aryavarta and the conduct of this region is proof for others

 * Other acharyas have also been voted in that the region between Ganga and Yamuna is also Aryavarta

 In these scriptures, the names of many ancient masters were mentioned by name or without name, which also helps us to know their views
 dharmasutron* se hamen jatiyon kii utpatti kaa itihaas jaanane main bhi paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Most of the Dharmasutras are either part of the kalpa associated with a sutracharan or belong to the grihasuutras, whereas the scriptures are not related to any sutracharan
 dharamshastra padyamay hai, jabaki dharmasutra gadhy yaa gadhy-padya main hote hai
 The Dharmasutras have special respect for the Vedas or Charanas of their branch, whereas it is not so in the Dharmasutras
 dharmasutron main vishay-vivechan kaa koi nishchit kram nahin rahata, jabaki dharamshastron main sabhi vishyon kaa aachaar, vyavhaar tathaa praayshchitt in teen bhaagon main vibhaajan karke krambaddh tathaa vyavasthit vivechan uplabdh hota he
 According to Max Müller, theology is merely a variation of the Dharmasutras
 unka swatantra astitv nahin he
 Accordingly, Manusmriti is only a new version of any ancient human religion of Maitrayani branch
 grihyasutra tathaa dharmasutra donon hi smartt hai
 Sometimes the Dharmasutras also follow the Grihyasutras of their kalpa and give the theme of Grihyasutras
 tathaapi unki satta evam pramanikta swatantra he
 At this time only four Dharmasutras are available who follow their Grihyasutras
 ye hai – boudhayan, aapstamb, hiranyakeshi tathaa vaikhanas grihyasutra
 Dharmasutras following other Grihyasutras are not available at this time
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki apane-apane kalp ke grihyasutra tathaa dharmasutra kaa kartta ek hi vyakti hota tha
 Dr
 Ram Gopal has expressed this view in this subject- 'it is proven that the k गृह्य्यa Sutras of the same kalpa and the k कर् का काa of the Dharmasत्रtra were the same people, but there is a difference of opinion in this subject that according to all the Griसूa Sutras of the same branch
 Dharmasutras were also composed or only this feature was placed in the kalpas of some branches
 ' kundal lala sharma bhi dharm, shrout tathaa grihyasutra in teenon kaa kartta ek hi vyakti ko maanate hue likhte hai- 'yah siddhanth sthir samajhnaa chahie ki ek kalp ke shrout, grihy tathaa dharmasutron ke kartta ek hi vyakti the
 'if their actors were a single person, these texts would have been synchronized
 ek hi kartta ne koun-sa sutaragranth pehle rachaa tathaa koun-sa baad main, isse inke paurvapary par vishesh antar nahin padataa
 Dr
 Umesh Chandra Pandey has also indicated on the basis of commentators of the Dharmasutras that the Dharmasutras existed before the Shroutas and the Grihyasutras, but Dr
 Pandey has rendered this, rejecting the fact that the Dharmasutras were followed by the Shrutasutras and the Grihasutras
 Are compositions
 * The Gautama, Baudhayana and Aapastamb Dharmasutras are considered ancient compared to other Dharmasutras and are kept between 300 BCE and 600 BCE
 maanav-jivan ko niyantrit karne ke liye manusmriti aadi dharamshastra tathaa gautmadi ke dwaara pranit dharmasutron ke rup main do prakaar ke granth uplabdh hote hai
 The question is whether theology is predecessor or is the Dharmasutra antecedent? Scholars have given their own arrangements on both sides
 ant: sakshya ke aadhaar par dharamshastron ko dharmasutron se purvavarti mana ja saktaa he, kyonki dharmasutron main dharamshastra tathaa inke kartaaon kaa ullekh anekatra hua he
 The following examples for this are Drishtavya where the * Dharmashastra is mentioned - 'tasya ch bhavono vede dharmashastrakhyangangi upveda: Puranam
 ' itnaa hi nahin, apitu gautam dharmasutra main manu kaa saakshaat naam bhi liya gaya he
 * The religion of others has also been mentioned by the words 'AK' * and 'acharya' * etc
 at many places in the Dharmasutras
 is aadhaar par kuch vidwaanon ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki ye sanket dharamshastron kii ore hi hai
 But the above statement is based on inference
 'eke' tathaa 'acharya:' aadi shabdon ke dwaara anya dharmasutrakaron kaa samaran bhi kiya ja saktaa he keval dharamshastrakaron kaa hi nahin
 Therefore, this cannot be presented as a precursor to the scriptures
 punarapi gautam dharmasutra main manu dharamshastron kaa ullekh hone se inako gautam dharmasutra se purvavarti maananaa hi samichin he
 Kundanlal Sharma has expressed his intention in these words - even before the creation of the sutra, it was a poetic composition, but it was destroyed
 buhalar ke anusaar is prakaar ke shloke smritisahaybhoot lokprachlit padyon ke ansh the
 Maxmüller considered the Dharmasutras to be predecessors rather than theology
 stantslar kaa anuwaad karte hue maxmooler ne balpurvak yah mat vyakt kiya he ki sabhi padayatmak dharamshastron kii rachana bina kisi apwaad ke pracheen sutara-rachanaaon ke aadhaar par kii gayi thi
 Dr
 Bhandarkar also has the same view that only after the creation of the Dharmasutras were the scriptures having an infinite number of verses
 mampivi kane isse sahamat nahin hai
 According to him, the Dharmasutras are predecessors and the Dharmasutras latter - 'similarly there are a few verses quoted in some very old sutras viz
 Boudhayan Dharmasutra', this makes it clear that the scriptural scriptures existed even before the Dharmasutras
 manusmriti aadi dharamshastron ke kaal par vichaar karte hue hamen yah bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki yaskacharya ne nirukt main manu kaa naam liya he
 Therefore, it has to be believed that theology existed before Yask
 yask kaa kaal 800 i pus mana jaataa he
 The Manusmrityadi theology precedes it and the Dharmasutras prove to be contemporaries of Yask or even later
 itnaa to nishchit he ki dharmasutron main pracheenatam gautam, boudhayan or aapstamb ke dharmasutra isa purv 600 or 300 ke bich ke samay ke hai

 This island of Sri Lanka has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BCE in the production of eminent scholars and preservation of the principles of the vast Pali
 apane itihaas main sinhalai raajaaon ne dweep ke buddha sansthaaon ke rakrakhaav or punarutthan main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai he
 During the 19th century, Buddhist education and learning was promoted but it took place in a modern Buddhist revival island
 srilanka main 6,000 buddha mathon main lagbhag 15,000 bhikshu evam bhikshuniyaan hai
 According to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the Dipavamsa, Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the Third Buddhist Council by Mahinda Bhikkhu, son of Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura
 During this time, a sapling of the Bodhi Tree was brought to Sri Lanka and the first monasteries and Buddhist monuments were established
 Among these, the Isurumuniya and the Vessagiri remain important centers of worship
 He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka cetiya, the Jambukola vihāra and the Hatthālhaka vihāra and the refectory
 The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE
 Mahavamsa §29 records that during the rule of the greco-bactrian King Menander I, a Yona head monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" north of modern Kabul, Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Ruwanwelisaya in Anuradhapura, indicating that greco-buddhism contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism
 See also the Milinda Panha
 As a result of the work of Buddhaghosa and other compilers such as Dhammapala, Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of written textual transmission of the Pali Canon
 The compilation of the Atthakatha along with the Nikāyas and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the Aluvihare Rock Temple during the first century BCE
 Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks discussed widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works
 Over much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Theravāda existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three mahaviharas, Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavanaramaya
 The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was the first tradition to be established while Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavanaramaya were established by monks who had broken away from the Maha Viharaya tradition
 According to A
K
 Warder, the Indian Mahīśāsaka established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravadas, into which they were later absorbed
 Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times
 In the 7th century, Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the "mahayana Sthaviras," and the Mahāvihāra tradition as the "hinayana Sthaviras
" Abhayagiri appears to have been a center for Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings; Xuanzang writes, "the Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the Tripiṭaka
 In the 8th century, both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Vajrayana Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time
 In Pali commentaries, terms used for the Mahayanins of Abhayagiri were Vaitulya, Vaipulya and Vaidalya
 According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included: In the 5th century, Faxian visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks
 Faxian obtained a Sanskrit copy of the Vinaya of the Mahīśāsaka at the Abhayagiri vihāra c
 406
 The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and Zhu Daosheng
 This translation of the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya remains extant in the Chinese Buddhist canon as Taishō Tripiṭaka 1421
 The 7th century pilgrim Xuanzang first learned for several years at Nalanda and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction
 However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the Chola capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit: From the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and Pandyan dynasties
 This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation for difficult for Buddhism
 In 1070, Vijayabahu i of Polonnaruwa conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries
 The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; therefore, he sent an embassy to Burma, which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts
 The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks
 The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under Parakramabahu I, who restored many stupas and monasteries
 During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers Mahākassapa Thera of Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara, Moggallana Thera and Sāriputta Thera compiled Pali commentaries and sub-commentaries
 Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts
 Before the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris, and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka
 The trend of Abhayagiri being the dominant sect changed in the 12th century, when the Maha Viharaya gained the political support of Parakramabahu I, who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanaya traditions
 The monks of these two traditions were then defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently or involving reordination under the Maha Viharaya tradition as sāmaṇeras
 Parakkamabāhu also appointed a saṅgharāja "king of the Sangha," a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka with the assistance of two deputies
 Veneration of Avalokiteśvara has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka, where he is called Nātha
 In more recent times, some western-educated Theravādins have attempted to identify Nātha with Maitreya
 However, traditions and basic iconography, including an image of Amitābha on his crown, identify Nātha as Avalokiteśvara
 Early reports by Europeans from the 18th century describe the Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka as being engaged in the recitation of mantras and using Buddhist prayer beads for counting as practiced in Mahayana Buddhism
 Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation, with the Sangha having existed in a largely unbroken lineage since its introduction in the 3rd century BCE
 During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and Thailand
 From the 16th century onward, missionaries and Portuguese, Dutch and British colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to Christianity
 The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha
 In 1592, Vimaladharmasuriya i of Kandy sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left
 From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British 
 The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing, though they are still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant
 During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy and Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries
 In the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe
 In 1813 the American Ceylon Mission was established in Jaffna
 In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948
 Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-christian marriages
 They also always preferred Christians in government administration
 The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island
 Education in these schools were a requirement for government office
 Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and Promoting Christianity In the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the Panadura debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists
 In 1880 Henry Steel Olcott arrived in Sri Lanka with Madame Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion
 Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of establishing Buddhist schools 
 The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, Sarasavisandarasa, and its English counterpart, The Buddhist
 As a result of their efforts, Vesak became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased
 Another important figure in the revival is Anagarika Dharmapala, initially an interpreter for Olcott, who traveled around the island preaching and writing
 After traveling to India, he established the Maha Bodhi Society in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinara
 His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians
 The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship
 Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir D
 B
 Jayatillake, F
 R
 Somnayake, Valisinha Harishchandra and W
 A
 de Silva
 Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt
 Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence
 Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island
 Since the Buddhist revival Sri Lanka has also been an important center of Western Buddhist scholarship
 One of the first western bhikkhus, Nyanatiloka Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the Island Hermitage there and ordained several western monks
 Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as Nanamoli Bhikkhu and Ven
 Nyanaponika were responsible for many important translations of the Pali Canon and other texts on Buddhism in English and German
 a few years after the arrival of Mahinda, Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta, who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka
 She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century
 Many women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996
 In 1996 through the efforts of Sakyadhita, an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived, when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure conducted by Ven 
 Dodangoda Revata Mahāthera and the late Ven
 Mapalagama Vipulasāra Mahāthera of the Mahābodhi Society in India with assistance from monks and nuns of Korean Chogyo order
 Some bhikkhuni ordinations were carried out with the assistance of nuns from the East Asian tradition; others were carried out by the Theravada monk's Order alone
 Since 2005, many ordination ceremonies for women have been organized by the head of the Dambulla chapter of the Siyam Nikaya in Sri Lanka
 The different sects of the Sri Lankan Buddhist clergy are referred to as Nikayas, and three main Nikayas are: Within these three main divisions there are numerous other divisions, some of which are caste based
 There are no doctrinal differences among any of them
 Buddhism in Sri Lanka is predominantly practised by the Sinhalese, however the 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254, including eleven monks, amongst the Sri Lankan Tamil population, accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka
 In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhalese speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist

 sookshmjaiviki jeev vigyaan kii ek shakha he
 It would be appropriate to consider the present state of microbiology in a little historical context
 is vigyaan ne apane itihaas main kai uval adhyyon kii rachana kii he
 This science entered the nineteenth century brilliantly thanks to the modern microbiological scientist Pasteur, Koch and his students
 shuru se hi sookshmjeev vigyaan ke anusandhan va upyog ne swasthya, poshan or paryaavaran par asar daalaa he
 In this way, the wider impact of this science can be seen on the society
 gauratlab he ki pramukh sankramak rogon kii sookshmjaivik prakriya kii khoj unnisvin sadi ke pratham bees varshon main ho chuki thi or iske falswaroop in bimariyon kii rotham va ilaaj ke prayaas shuru ho chuke the
 Many disease-resistant vaccines being used today are the result of early microbiologists
 duusari mahatvapurn baat yah rahi ki shuruuaati anusandhan se prakruti main padaarthon ke chakron ko samajhane madad mili or is samaj ne khaadya utpaadan va parirakshan ke liye ek taarkik aadhaar uplabdh karaayaa
 This was the first golden age of microbiological science
 beesvin sadi ke pratham kuch dashakon main sookshmjeev vigyaan kai swatantra shakhaon main bant gaya
 Specific topics were replaced by Pasteur's attempt to bring integration into the subject using one-way methods in medical and environmental microbiology
 is avadhi main chikitsa se sambandhit sookshmjeev vaigyanik or pratiraksha vaigyanik mulat: jeev ke str par shodh kaary kar rahe the
 The attempt was to integrate the activities of the parasite and its host
 duusari ore paryaavaran sookshmjeev vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan rasinic prakriyaaon par tha
 The result of the research work of Sergei Vinogradsky of Russia and Martinus Beierink and Albert Kluwer of Holland was that environmental microbiology gradually became a branch of comparative biochemistry
 isamen jor is baat par tha ki samast sajivon main jaev-rasinic prakriyaayein ek si hoti hai
 Broadly speaking, microbiology did not emerge as a complete cytology during this period
 shesh jeev vigyaan ko to kaaphi vyapak koshikeey khojbin kaa laabh mila tha, haalanki koshikaon ko alag-alag karnaa or electron sookshmdarshi abhi puure joardaar dhang se ubhare nahin the
 At that time, the biochemists and their outstanding achievements were dominated by experimental biology, they were able to reveal the basic body functions with a special degree
 magar is sabase yah samajhane kii disha main koi madad nahin mili thi ki bacteria bhi koshika hote hai or unka ek jatil sanghathan hota he
 Researchers inspired by biochemistry considered bacteria as particles, which you can grind with sand or reduce pressure and break
 bacteria koshika ke pramukh ghatak hai
 The main component of the bacterial cell was a blurred image of the cell wall, cell membrane, organisms and nuclei
 bactabhriya or unki sanrachana tikhi va jajbaati bahes ke vishay the
 There were few such intelligent researchers whose work could survive in the coming years, at that time this topic was called bacterial cytology
 is vishay ko bacteria koshika vigyaan kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from the people working in this subject, the rest of the people considered the bacteria and perhaps even the virus a little strange
 is baat par bhi sahmati nahin ban pai thi ki bacteria koshika he yaa nahin
 The presence of jeans in them was far away
 is jamaane kii pravrit kaa andaaj isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jab 1928 main phered griffith ne bacteria main genetic pherbadal kii haroonges khoj kii to ise lekar koi utsaah paidaa nahin hua tha
 The second golden age of microbiological science begins in the 1940s with molecular genetics
 is yug kaa aagaaj 1943 main salador luria or maiks delbruk ke sundar prayog ke saath hua tha
 These scientists attempted to solve a fundamental question of evolutionary biology with the help of the bacterial system
 sawaal yah tha kya utparivartan swat: hote hai yaa paryaavaran ke dabaav main hote hai? naatakeey dhang se, is prayog ne darshaya tha ki jeev vigyaan ke kuch mahatvapurn sawaalon ko samajhane ke liye bacteria va bacteriabhakshiyon kaa upyog bakhubi kiya ja saktaa he
 Shortly thereafter, Joshua Lederberg discovered coagulation in Bacteria in 1946
 is khoj ne jeev vigyaan ko ek nai disha di
 If bacteria can interact, they must be cells
 in jabardast uplabdhiyon ke baad 1960 ke dashak main kai aisi khojein hui jinhone nae raste khole
 These discoveries were related to basic biological processes
 inamen diene kii sanrachana, plasmids kaa astitv va mahatv, jin abhivyakti kaa niyaman tathaa genetic code kaa khulaasa shaamil hai
 Now the situation has become that if you want to be on the forefront of biology, then you have to work with microorganism models
 lagbhag isi samay antibiotics kaa vyapak upyog hone laga tha
 After this, a major branch of microbiology went into the background of studying microbes
 vastav main kuch logon ne to ghoshnaa kar daali thi ki sankramak rog samaapt hone ko hai or iske saath hi chikitsakeey sookshmjeev vigyaan ateet kaa vishay ho jayega
 However, this announcement has proved to be a little rude
 baharhaal 1950 se 1970 ke bich sookshmjeev vigyaan lagbhag aanvik jeev vigyaan kaa samanaarthi ho gaya tha
 Gradually, things learned from microorganisms were also found useful in the study of cells of other animals and plants
 khaas taur se khamir jaise jeevon main to inhen sidhe-sidhe lagu kiya ja saktaa tha
 Other organisms cannot be manipulated so easily, nor do they increase the number of bacteria
 inke adhyayan main to diene chloning va diene shrinkhalaa ke nirdhaaran kii takneekon se or bhi zyada laabh hua
 The result was that many researchers ran towards eukaryotic cells leaving bacteria
 sookshmjeev vigyaan ke din phir palate hai
 This science seems to be entering the third golden age
 is baat ko ham nimnlikhit sandarbhon main dekh sakate hai
 Microorganism Ecology: Once upon a time it was a specialized branch of microbiology but now it is coming to the center because of the polymerase chain reaction and the cloning technique, it is now possible to break free from the narrow range of model organisms of almost any microorganism
 Can study
 inamen ve sookshmjeev bhi shaamil hai jinhen prayogshaala main culture karnaa sambhav nahin ho paaya he
 According to an estimate, these constitute 99 percent of the total microorganisms
 ab ham is tarah ke sawaalon ke jawaab de sakate hai
 Which organisms live, what does and what is genetically related to
 iske parinamswaroop gyaat sookshmjivi duniya bahut vishaal ho gai he
 Entire new groups like Archaea have emerged
 sookshmjeev ekadam anpekshit jagahon par khoje ja sake hai
 Like in the warm seeps and deep cracks of rocks
 ye aise sookshmjeev hai jo surya kii urja or oxigen par nirbhar nahin hai
 These have greatly expanded the scope of microorganism ecology and broadened our understanding of the role of microorganisms in the cycles of matter in nature
 is baat kii samaj bhi bad rahi he ki prakruti main sookshmjeev samoohon main rahete hai: kuch apane sagon ke saath, to kuch anya prajatiyon ke saath
 Due to this, the study of microorganisms is moving out of laboratory and towards their habitat
 kuch shodhakartaaon ne aise jeens khoj nikaale hai jo sirf tabhi abhivyakt hote he jab sookshmjeev apane mejabaan ke sharir main hote hai
 Due to this ecological perspective, many new procedures are being identified
 jaev vikaas: mulat: sies kaa parinaam he ki eukeriot jeevon kii bajaae zyada sankhya main cendrak purv jeevon kii jinom shrinkhalaa kaa khulaasa ho paaya he
 This is not surprising
 ki jaankaree ke is samrudh bhandar se munafa kamaane ke liye bada udyog astitv main aa gaya he
 Genome-related information has also been used to explore the path of bio-evolution
 is sandarbh main ek ascharyajanak khoj yah hui he ki jeens kaa ek jeev se duusare jeev main sthanantaran kaaphi vyapak he or iske prabhaav bhi kaaphi vyapak hai
 Unrelated species have genome biases that equip them with new functional properties
 bacteria main paraspar asambandhit prajatiyon ke bich jeens kaa len-dein hota he
 The pervasiveness of such lateral gene transfer has forced us to wonder whether bio-evolution can be treated as purely separate branches
 vastav main yah ho rahaa he ki ped kii vibhinn shakhaon ke bich len-dein ho rahaa he
 That is, the ancestors of an organism cannot be traced in just one linear order, the interaction between different lines also has to be taken into consideration
 is baat ke bhi sanket mili he ki yah len-dein eukeriotic-prokeriotic ke bich ke bhi hota he
 Incidentally, it is significant that due to all this, the concept of species in the world of microorganisms becomes dirty
 sookshmjeev koshika vigyaan ek purana muhaavara he bacteria to mahaj anzime kii theliyaan hai
 But if seen, within the scope of a few cubic micrometers, they contain a very sophisticated and unexpected organization
 koshika ke vibhinn ghatak gatisheel dhang se kaam karte hai
 This molecular exposure has been revealed by fluorescence microscopy and other techniques
 kuch bade anu vishisht sthanon par bandhe rahete hai jabaki anya anu nirdhaarit margon par koshika kii sataha par upasthit grahi, koshikaon ke paraspar sanket yaa koshikeey kankal jaise bacteria i
 kaali aanton kii diwaar se chipakane ke lae mejabaan koshika ke actin kaa upyog karata he
 This is what Shigella and other bacteria use to move from one host cell to another
 These processes help us understand eukaryotic cells
 aajkal rogaanu vaigyanikon ko praaia: koshika jeev vigyaan ke sammelnon main parche prastut karne ko aamantrit kiya jaataa he ummid karen ki inase puri maanavtaa labhanvit hogi
 Due to these concerns, there is tremendous moral pressure on microbiological scientists of all countries
 is samay yah tay karne kaa koi spasht paimaana nahin he ki koun-sa kaam badaniyat kaa dyotak he
 It is hoped that researchers working in this field will be able to make such decisions and work for the good of all

 plateform par railgadee Platform metro railway stesan Ashtadhyayi is an extremely ancient Sanskrit grammar book by Maharishi Panini
 isamen aath adhyay hai; prayek adhyay main chaar paad hai; prayek paad main 38 se 220 tak sutara hai
 Thus, there are eight chapters in Ashtadhyayi, thirty-two footers and about 3155 sutras all together
 ashtaadhi par mahamuni katyayan kaa vistrut vaarthik granth he or sutara tathaa vaartikon par bhagwaan patanjali kaa vishad vivarnaatmak granth mahabhashya he
 In short, the sutras, the tatric and the great language, are called 'paninian grammar' in the combined form, and the sutrakar Panini, the pratikkara katyayana and the commentator Patanjali - are called the 'trimuni' of the three grammars
 ashtaadhi chah vedangon main mukhya mana jaataa he
 There are 3155 sutras in Ashtadhyayi and 14 pratyahara sutras of Varnasammanaya in the beginning
 ashtaadhi kaa pariman ek sahasr anushtup shloke ke baraabar he
 In the Mahabhashya, Ashtadhyayi is called "sarvaveda-parishad-shastra"
 arthath ashtaadhi kaa sambandh kisi vedavishesh tak simit na hokar sabhi vaidic samhitaon se tha or sabhi ke pratishru abhimaton kaa panini ne samaadar kiya tha
 In Ashtadhyayi, the opinions and formulas of many of the preliminaries were appropriated
 unamem se shakatayan, shaakalya, abhishalee, gargy, gaalav, bharadwaj, kashyap, shaunak, sphotayan, chakravarman kaa ullekh panini ne kiya he
 There are many views about when Ashtadhyayi's doer Panini happened

 Based on the postures mentioned together in Panini such as Shataman, Vishnitika and Karshapana, and due to many other reasons, we find this period of Panini very expedient
 ashtaadhi main aath adhyay hai or prayek adhyay main chaar paad hai
 The first second chapters have nouns and definitional formulas and also regulative cases of interrelations between verb and noun words in the sentence, such as atmanapada-parasampad-paisa for verbs, and inflection for nouns, compounding, etc
 tisare, chauthe or paanchaven adhyyon main sab prakaar ke pratyayon kaa vidhaan he
 The third chapter explains the participle words by adding suffixes to metals, and the fourth and fifth chapters describe the detailed interpretation of new noun words by adding suffixes to noun words
 ye pratyay jin arthvishyon ko prakat karte hai unhen vyakaran kii paribhaasha main vritti kehete hai, jaise varsha main honevaale indradhanu ko vaarshik indradhanu kahenge
 The suffix "ik", which expresses this special meaning occurring in the rain, is the copied suffix
 taddhit prakaran main 1,190 sutara hai or kridant prakaran main 631
 In this way, only a little less than half of Ashtadhyayi's 1,821 formulas have been appropriated for the constitution of kriddanta, the corresponding suffixes
 chathe, saatven or aathven adhyyon main un parivartanon kaa ullekh he jo shabd ke aksharon main hote hai
 These changes occur either because of suffixes joining the root word or because of the pact
 dvitv, samprasaran, sandhi, swar, aagam, lop, deergh aadi ke vidhayak sutara chathe adhyay main aae hai
 From the fourth foot of the sixth chapter to the end of the seventh chapter, there is a specific case called Angadhivaar which describes the changes that occur in the root words due to the suffix or in the suffixes due to the root word
 ye parivartan bhi deergh, hrasv, lop, aagam, aadesh, gun, vruddhi aadi ke vidhaan ke rup main hi dekhe jate hai
 In the eighth chapter, there is a special exhortation of bifurcation, plutocracy and shasta and sattvidavana of syntactic words
 ashtaadhi ke atirikt usee se sambandhit ganpaath or dhatupath naamak do prakaran bhi nishchit rup se panini nirmit the
 Their tradition continues till date, although some new words in the Ganpath have also been added to the old lists over time
 vartmaan unadi sutron ke paninikrut hone main andeh he or unhen ashtaadhi ke ganpaath ke samaan abhinn ang nahin mana ja saktaa
 The present Unadi Sutras are the known accounts of Shaktaayana-grammar
 panini ne sanskrit bhashaa ke tatkaaleen swaroop ko parishkrut evam niyamit karne ke uddeshy se bhashaa ke vibhinn avyavon evam ghatakon yatha dhwani-vibhaag, naam, pad, kriya, vaakya, ling ityadi tathaa unke antarsambandhon kaa samavesh ashtaadhi ke 32 padon main, jo aath adhyyon main samaan rup se vibhakt hai, kiya he
 In this important book of grammar, Panini has given a comprehensive and comprehensive discussion of the huge collection of the divisive-dominated Sanskrit language in about 4000 sutras, which are unequally divided in number by eight chapters
 tatkaaleen samaaj main lekhan saamagree kii dushprapyata ko dhyaan main rakhkar panini ne vyakaran ko smritigamya banane ke liye sutara style kii sahaayta lee he
 Again, Panini has used many tools from his predecessor grammar as well as himself, to make the discussion very brief, of which the Shivasutra or Maheshwar Sutras are the most important
 prasiddh he ki maharishi panini ne in sutron ko devadhidev shiv se praapt kiya tha
 Panini composed about 4000 sutras for the interpretation of all the words in the Sanskrit language which are scientifically stored in the eight chapters of Ashtadhyayi
 ye sutara vastav main ganit ke sutron kii bhanti hai
 Just as complex and elaborate mathematical assumptions or principles are easily expressed by formulas, Panini has explained the complex rules of grammar very briefly by formulas
 bhashaa ke samast pahaluon ke vivechan hetu hi unhen 4000 sutron kii rachana kerani padi
 Panini has divided the cases and related sources in Ashtadhyayi in a scientific manner
 panini ne ashtaadhi ko do bhaagon main baanta he: pratham adhyay se lekar aathven adhyay ke pratham paad tak ko sapadasptadhyaayi evam shesh teen padon ko tripadi kaha jaataa he
 Panini has instructed by creating the Pu पूर्वtrasiddhidam Sutra that the rules described in Tripadi are imperfect as compared to the rules considered in Sapadasaptadhyayi
 arthath, yadi dono bhaagon main varnit niyamon ke madhya yadi kabhi virodh ho jaae to purv bhaag kaa niyam hi maanya hoga
 Similarly, in case of opposition in the formulas coming under Sapadasaptadhyayi, the succession of the later formula will be predominant - work on opposition
 in siddhanton ko sthapit karne ke baad, panini ne sarvapratham sangya padon ko paribhaashit kiya he or baad main un sangya padon par aadhaarit vishay kaa vivechan
 Panini has taken several measures to maintain brevity
 isamen sabase mahatvapurn he – vishisht sangyaaon kaa nirmaan
 Panini collected the words / syllables of the language which were frequently required in stating the rules of grammar, and gave them different specific names which are used in different contexts as required by the Ashtadhyayi as nouns
 niyamon ko bataane ke pehle hi panini waisi sangyaaon ko paribhaashit kar dete hai, yatha – maheshwar sutara – 'pratyaahaar, it, ti, nadi, ghu, pad, dhaatu, pratyay, ang, nishtha ityadi
 Some of these have been borrowed by Panini from his predecessor grammars
 lekin adhikansh swayan unke dwaara banaae gaye hai
 The details of these nouns are given further
 vyakaran ke kuch avyavon yatha dhaatu, pratyay, upsarg ke vivechan me, panini ko anek niyamon kii aavashyaktaa padi
 Before the formulation of such rules, Panini mentions those related ingredients at the beginning and that they will have the right to a certain formula
 in avyavon ko ve purv main hi sangya rup main paribhaashit kar chuke hai
 In other words, Panini interprets a particular case in the possession of the basic noun of that case - ie metal, suffix etc
 - so that they do not have to repeat the noun in each sutra again and again

 Even Panini has highlighted the socio-linguistic use of the language
 panini kaa vyakaran sampoorn hone ke saath hi itnaa chota he ki log ise yaad karte aaye hai
 Although Panini composed his grammar for Sanskrit, but his tips and tools can be used to analyze grammar in all languages

 The grammar of the Vedic language could have been even more perfect

 or bhi, maathurivriti, punyavritti aadi vrittiyaan thim jinaki parampara main vartmaan kashikavriti he
 Within about two centuries of Ashtadhyayi's work, Katyayan, while conducting a multi-faceted review of the sutras, composed about four millennials who are in sutra style
 vaarthiksutra or kuch vrittisutron ko lekar patanjali ne mahabhashya kaa nirmaan kiya jo panineey sutron par arth, udhaaharan or prakriya kii drushti se sarvopari granth he
