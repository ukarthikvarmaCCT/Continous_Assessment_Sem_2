ahura majadaa koi vyakti nahin he, balki satv he, shakti he, urja he
 According to Zarathustra, there is a constant struggle between two primordial souls in the world
 inamen ek he ahura majadaa kii aatma, 'spenta manu'
 The second is the evil spirit 'anghara Menu'
 is dusht aatma ke naash hetu hi ahura majadaa ne apni saat kritiyon yatha akaash, jal, prithvi, vanaspati, pashu, maanav evam agni se is bhautik vishwa kaa srijan kiya
 They knew that due to their destructive nature and ignorance, the Anghara menu would attack this world and would enter into chaos, untruth, sorrow, cruelty, sickness and death
 manushya, jo ki ahura majadaa kii sarvshereshth kriti he, kii is sangharsh main kendriya bhoomika he
 He has to voluntarily take on the evil spirit in this struggle
 is yuddh main uske astr honge achchhai, satya, shakti, bhakthi, adarsh evam amartv
 By following these principles, humans will eventually end all the evil in the world
 kuch adhik vaigyanik kasuti par dharm ko parakhane vaale 'spenta manu' kii vyakhya alag tarah se karte hai
 According to it, the 'spenta menu' is not a soul, but an incremental, progressive mind or mindset
 arthath yah ahura majadaa kaa ek gun he, vah gun jo brahmand kaa nirmaan evam sanvardhan karata he
 God created the spenta menu so that a happy world could be created
 pragatisheel maansikta hi prithvi par manushyon ko do virgon main baantati he
 The virtuous, who promote the world and the vicious, who stop its progress
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki prayek vyakti ishwar tulya bane, jeevandaayee urja ko apanaae tathaa nirmaan, sanvardhan evam pragati kaa vaahak bane
 According to the teachings of Prophet Zarathustra, the world is a moral system
 is vyavastha ko swayan ko kaayam hi nahin rakhana he, balki apana vikaas tathaa sanvardhan bhi karnaa he
 Inertia is not allowed in Zarathosti religion
 vikaas kii prakriya main buree takatein baadha pahunchaati hai, parantu manushya ko isse vichlit nahin hona he
 He has to keep moving in the direction of development always while maintaining the path of virtue
 jivan ke prayek kshan kaa ek nishchit uddeshy he
 It is not something that starts spontaneously and ends spontaneously
 sab kuch ishwar kii yojana ke anusaar hota he
 Supreme goodness should be the aim of our life
 manushya ko achchhai se, achchhai dwaara, achchhai ke liye jeena he
 'humat', 'huqt' and 'huvarshat' are the pillars of the Zarthosti way of life
 jarathosti dharm main mathvaad, brahmacharya, vrath-upwas, aatm daman aadi kii manaahi he
 It is believed that they weaken humans and reduce their strength to fight against evil
 nirashavad va avsaad ko to paap kaa darja diya gaya he
 Zarathustra wants humans to enjoy this world fully and be happy
 vah jo bhi kare, bas ek baat kaa khyaal avashya rakhe or vah yah ki sadachaar ke maarg se kabhi vichlit na ho
 a life endowed with material comforts is not forbidden, but it has also been said that you give more than what you take from the society
 kisi kaa haq markar yaa shoshan karke kuch paanaa duraachaar he
 Those who are less rich than us should always help
 jarathosti dharm main daihik mrityu ko buraai kii asthaayee jeet mana gaya he
 After this, the soul of the deceased will be judged
 yadi vah sadaachari hui to anand va prakaash main vaas paaegi or yadi duraachaari hui to andhkaar va nairashya kii gaharaaiyon main jaaegi, lekin duraachaari aatma kii yah sthiti bhi asthaayee he
 After all, Zoroastrian religion considers the ultimate aim of the world to be the victory of good, not the punishment of evil
 atah yah manyata he ki antat kai muktidaata aakar buraai par achchhai kii jeet puri karenge
 Then Ahura Mazda will be well-supported as Aseem Prakash
 phir atmaaon kaa antim faisla hoga
 After this the physical body will be resurrected and reunited with its own soul
 samay kaa astitv samaapt ho jayega or ahura majadaa kii saat kritiyaan shaashvat dhanyata main ek saath aa milengi or aanandamay, anshwar astitv ko praapt karengi

 His authored book 'charaka Samhita' is still considered as a unique text of Vaidyaka

 Some scholars believe that Charaka was the king of Kanishka but some believe it to be before the Buddhist period
 aathvin shatabdi main is granth kaa arabi bhashaa main anuwaad hua or yah shaastra pashchimi deshon tak pahunchaa
 In Charaka Samhita, remedies of diseases have been mentioned, incidentally, there is also mention of topics of philosophy and economics
 unhone ayurveda ke pramukh granthon or uske gyaan ko ikattha karke uskaa sankalan kiya 
 Charak traveled and held meetings with physicians, collected ideas and formulated the principles and made them eligible to study

 Therefore, it is possible that Charaka Samhita has been rewarded in Charaka branch
 charakasamhita main pali sahitya ke kuch shabd milte hai, jaise avakranti, jenta, bhangodan, khuddak, bhootdhatri 
 With this, the sermon of Charaksamhita is fixed after the Upanishads and before the Buddha

 The Chinese translation of Tripitaka mentions Charaka as the king of the Kanishka
 kintu kanishka buddha tha or uskaa kavi ashwaghosh bhi buddha tha, par charak samhita main buddhamat kaa joardaar khandan miltaa he
 Therefore, the relationship between Charak and Kanishka seems to be not only doubtful but impossible

 vastav main videshi shashan ke adheen hone ke kaaran hamaare desh kii na to koi rajbhasha thi or na koi prantiy bhashaa hi apane praant main sarkari kaamkaaj main vishesh mahatv praapt kar saki thi
 Therefore, like Hindi typing, the original inspiration for Hindi transcription came from English shorthand
 bharat main twaralekhan ke vikaas kii ek katha he ki jab vedavyas mahabharat likhane ke liye baithe tab unke sanmukh yah samasya upasthit hui ki is vishaal mahabharat ko koun lipibaddh karegaa

 But this happened to be a mythological matter sansar kii bhashaaon main twaralekhan kaa prayaas praaia: rome samrajya main isa purv 63 main hua
 In order to note the speeches of Cicero etc
 in the Senate of Rome, Marcus Tullius Tiro invented a system of quick writing, called 'tironian Note'
 is pranali kaa prachlan rome samrajya ke patan ke pashchaat kai shatabdiyon baad tak rahaa
 Simultaneously, there was an invention of dermatography in Greece in the fourth century BCE, which continued till the eighth century
 vartmaan twaralekhan kaa janmasthan england he
 During the time of Queen Elizabeth, a shorthand called 'bright's System' was invented
 phir san 1630 itho main tamas shelaton ne twaralekhan par ek pustak prakashit karai
 Subsequently, in 1737 AD, Dr
 John Byron published a book titled 'universal English Short Hand' of the scribe
 kintu in sabhi paddatiyon main laghupran aksharon ko hataakar tathaa kuch anya aksharon ko shabdon ke bich main se nikaalkar sankshipt kiya jaataa tha, isse vaktaa ke bhaashan ko note karne main sahuuliyat ho jaati thi
 But at the same time there was an attempt to write on the basis of sound
 dhwani paddati : sar ijak pitman kii pustak 'stegographic sound hand' san 1837 itho main prakashit hui
 In this method, vowels and consonants were determined by different symbols
 saath hi sankshipt karne kaa bhi ek niyam banaaya gaya
 This method continued to develop and later on the system proved to be very useful
 angreji main pitmans pranali kaa hi vishesh prachlan he
 Due to the fact that Hindi transcription is not economically profitable and Hindi is not an important place in British India, the effort to explore acceleration was relatively delayed
 kintu phir bhi twaralekhan ke avishkaar ke liye yadakada praytn hote rahe
 At the time of the movements for independence, the Government of British India used to note down the speeches of the leaders in Hindi, so that they could hold the leaders accountable for the objectionable views expressed against the government
 us samay angreji ke pitman shorthand ke hi aadhaar par, abhyaas ke bal par, bhaashanon ke note liye jate the, kintu saath hi hindi ke twaralekhan kii neenv pad gai thi
 In 1907 AD, the Kashi Nagri Pracharini Sabha published a book titled 'hindi' shorthand of Shri Nishkameshwar Mishra, BA, LT, which is the first important book of its subject in Hindi dermatography
 shri mishra mahoday ne bade parishram se hindi shorthand kii jo pustak taiyaar kii, vah unki abhootpurv sujh kaa parinaam to thi hi, saath hi usase hindi twaralekhan seekhneyvaalon ke liye ek samuchit maarg mil gaya
 Before this, the method of Urdu dermatography used to note the Hindustani language could be written at the speed of one hundred words per minute in a year and a half after hard work
 lekin shri mishra ji kii nishkameshwar pranali se paanch-saat maheene ke abhyaas se hi sau shabd prati minute kii gati se likhaa jane laga
 The efforts of other gentlemen in Hindi dermatography were also continued
 In this direction, Shri Rishilal Agarwal of Allahabad did the most important work
 rishi pranali unheen kaa avishkaar he
 Prior to the invention of this system, Hindi writings had been promoted
 isaliye hindi twaralekhan ke kshetra main ai asuvidhaon ko samajhakar unke niraakaran kaa praytn shri rishilal agarwal ne kiya
 The most characteristic feature of this system has been that consonants are composed mostly of simple lines of geometry and where simple lines did not work, curve lines were taken, but these curve lines are also not wavy or arbitrary
 Laker is taken on the basis of circle

 At that time, Magadha was quite powerful and pricked the eyes of its neighboring states
 par tatkaaleen magadh ke samraat ghananand ne usko thukraa diya
 He said that you are a pundit and take care of your peak "war is the king's job, you are a pundit, only do panditai"
 Since then Chanakya took a vow that he would teach Dhanananda a lesson
 maury pracheen kshatriya kabeeley ke hisse rahe he
 According to Greek sources such as Brahmin literature, Visakhadatta Mudrarakshas and Justin, etc

 17:36) or kai alag-alag chhandon main musalamaanon se poochta he pramaanon kii aavashyaktaa ke liye, to saboot kii aavashyaktaa he, donon dharmik vishwaas or prakritik vigyaan main

 Ziauddin Sardar made a case for Muslims to develop the foundations of modern science in order to pay attention and reflect on the natural phenomena that the Quran repeatedly calls for
 bhautik vigyaani abdus salaam ne apane nobel puraskaar bhoj pate main quran kii ek prasiddh kavita uddhrut kii or phir kaha: "yah prabhaav sabhi bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he: jitna gaharaa ham chaahate hai, utana hi adhik hamaare aashcharya utsahit, hamaare nazar kaa chamak he "
 One of Salam's core beliefs was that there is no contradiction between Islam and discoveries that science tells humanity about nature and the universe
 salaam ne yah bhi raay rakhi ki quran or adhyayan or tarksangat pratibimb kii islamic bhaavana asaadhaaran sabhyataa ke vikaas kaa strot thi

 The message of the Quran is conveyed with various literary structures and devices
 mul arabi main, surya or chand dhvanyatmak or vishaygat sanrachanaon ko niojit karte hai jo paath ke sandesh ko yaad karne ke liye darshakon ke prayaason main sahaayta karte hai
 Muslims insist that the content and style of the Quran are inappropriate
 quran kii bhashaa ko "kavita gadhy" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he kyonki yah kavita or gadhy donon kaa hissaa he; haalanki, yah vivaran kuranik bhashaa kii layaaddh gunvattta ko vyakt karne main vifal hone kaa jokhim chalaata he, jo kuch hisson main adhik kavy he or dusron main adhik gadhy jaisaa he
 The Quran, while found throughout the Quran, is typical of many earlier Mecca Suras, in which relatively few verses throw singing words into prominence
 is tarah ke rup kii prabhaavashiltaa udhaaharan ke liye sura 81 main spasht he, or isamen koi andeh nahin he ki in margon ne shrotaaon ke vivek ko prabhavit kiya

 Selling also addresses the recurrence of much discussion of the Quran, also seeing it as a literary device
 ek paath aatm-sanderbhit hota he jab yah swayan ke bare main bolta he or khud ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Stephen Wilde, the Quran illustrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted
 un anuchhedon main aatm- refrencielity spasht he jahaan quran swayan ko ek aatmanirbhar tareeke se, samachar, maandand ke rup main swayan ko prakat karne ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 There is a blessed remembrance that we sent down, so are you rejecting it now? "), Or in the frequent presence of the" say "tag, when Muhammad is ordered to speak
 junglee ke anusaar quran atyadhik aatm-sanderbhit he
 This feature is more pronounced in early Mecca Suras
 mukhya lekh: tafasir The Quran has sparked a vast body of commentary and interpretation intended to explain the meanings of Quranic verses, clarify their import, and unravel their significance
 tafaseer musalamaanon kii sabase shuruaati shaikshanik gatividhiyon main se ek he
 According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person to describe the meanings of verses for early Muslims
 anya shuruaati nikaayon main mohammad ke kuch saathi shaamil the, jaise ' ali ebn abi talib ,' abdulla ebn abbaas, abdulla ebn umr or ubey ebn kaab 
 In those days exegesis was limited to the literary aspects of the poem, the background of its publication and, sometimes, the explanation of the interpretation of one poem with the help of another
 yadi kavita ek aitihaasik ghatana ke bare main thi, to kabhi-kabhi mohammad kii kuch paramparaon ko iskaa arth spasht karne ke liye varnit kiya gaya tha
 Since the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic, many of the latter did not convert to Islam, they did not always understand Quranic Arabic, they did not catch Muslims who were fluent in Arabic of Muslims and were concerned with settling subjects in the Quran
 Clear struggle of
 arabi main tippanee karne vaale tippaneekaron ne sanketon ko samajhaayaa, or shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah samajhaayaa ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke karier main quran ke chhandon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya tha, jo ki sabase shuruaati muslim samudaay ke liye upyukt tha, or jise baad main prakat kiya gaya tha, radd karnaa yaa " nirast karnaa " nasakh ) pehle ke paath 
 However, other scholars say that there is no repeal in the Quran
 ahmadiya muslim samudaay ne quran par das khand vaali urdu tippanee prakashit kii he, jiskaa naam tafaseer i kabir he 
 The esoteric interpretation or Sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meaning of the Quran
 sufiwaad chhandon ke spasht bindu se aage badhata he or iske bajaay quran ke chand ko aantarik yaa gudh or chetana or astitv ke aadhyatmik ayaamon se sambandhit karata he
 According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are indicative rather than explanatory
 ve sambhaavnaaon ko ingit karte hai jitna ki ve prayek lekhak kii antardrushti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The Sufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keller, is also an example of the use of the subject of love, for example in the Qur'anic interpretation of the Quran
 quran 7: 143 kahata he: When Moses came at the time when we appointed, and his Allah spoke to him, he said, 'my Allah, show me yourself! let me see you!' He said, 'you won't see me, but look at that mountain, if it stays strong you will see me
 ' jab uske bhagwaan ne pahaad par khud ko prakat kiya, to usne ise kharaab kar diya
 Moses fainted
 jab vah thik ho gaya, usne kaha, 'jai ho! main tumse pashchaatap karata hoon! main vishwaas karne vaala pehla vyakti hum! In 7: 143 Moses, the way of those who are in love, comes asking for a vision but his will is denied, he is commanded to see other than the mountain, while the mountain is able to see God
 
 parvat par bhagwaan ke prakat hone kii drushti se parvat chur or musa behosh hojaate hai
 In the words of Kushayari, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and Moses of Moses had nothing left
 khud se unmoolan kii sthiti main, musa ko vaastaviktaaon kaa anaavaran diya gaya tha
 From a Sufi point of view, God always causes the will and suffering of the beloved and the wayfarer to realize the truth
 mohammad hossain taababatei kehete hai ki baad ke utthanon ke bich lokapriy spashtikaran ke anusaar, tavil kaa arth he ki ek kavita kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 The meaning of revelation, as opposed to Tawal, is clear according to the explicit meaning of the words, as they were told
 lekin yah spashtikaran itnaa vyapak ho gaya he ki, vartmaan main, yah tavil kaa praathmik arth ban gaya he, jiskaa mul rup se "vaapasi karne" yaa "vaapasi sthaan" kaa arth tha
 In Tabatai's view, what is called taiwil or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran is not concerned with the signification of words
 iske bajaay, yah kuch sachai or vaastaviktaaon se sambandhit he jo purushon ke saamaanya bhaag kii samaj se pare he; phir bhi yah in satyon or vaastaviktaaon se he ki siddhant ke siddhant or quran ke vyaavhaarik nishedh jari hai
 Interpretation is not the meaning of the poem but it is transparent in a particular type of transit through that meaning
 ek aadhyatmik vaastaviktaa he- jo ek kanoon kaa paalan karne kaa mukhya uddeshy he, yaa divine gun kaa varnan karne kaa mul uddeshy he- or phir ek vaastavik mahatv he ki ek quran kii kahani kaa sandarbh he
 According to Shia beliefs, which are strongly rooted in knowledge such as Muhammad and Imams, know the mysteries of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, bayaan "koi bhi bhagwaan ko chhodkar isaki vyakhya ko jaanata he" kisi bhi virdohi yaa yogyata khand ke bina maanya rahata he
 Therefore, as far as this verse is concerned, knowledge of Quranic interpretation is reserved for God
 lekin Tabatabaei anya chhandon kaa upyog karata he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki jo log bhagwaan dwaara shuddh hai quran kii vyakhya kuch had tak pataa he
 According to Tabatai, there are esoteric interpretations that are acceptable and unacceptable
 sweekaarya ta'vil apane shabdic arth se pare ek kavita ke arth ko sanderbhit karata he; balki antarnihit arth, jo antat keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he or akele maanav vichaaron ke madhyam se sidhe samajha nahin ja saktaa he
 The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, contentment, anger, and sorrow, which are clearly attributed to God
 asweekaarya ta'wil vah he jahaan ek saboot ke madhyam se ek alag arth ke liye ek kavita kaa spasht arth "sthanantarit" hota he; yah vidhi spasht visangatiyon ke bina nahin he
 Although this unacceptable Ta'wil has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to Quranic verses
 sahi vyakhya yah he ki vaastaviktaa ek kavita ko sanderbhit karti he
 It is found in all verses, decisive and ambiguous alike; This is not the meaning of the word; It is a fact that it is too fantastic for words
 bhagwaan ne unhen apane dimag main thodaa sa laane ke liye shabdon ke saath taiyaar kiya he; is sambandh main ve kahaniyon kii tarah hai jinka upyog dimag main ek tasviir banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, or is prakaar shrota ko spasht rup se icchit vichaar ko samajhane main madad milti he
 One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation before the 12th century is Sulami whose work would not have been preserved without most of the early Sufi commentaries
 sulaami kii pramukh tippanee hekik al-tafaseer kii ek pustak he jo pehle sufi kii tippaniyon kaa sankalan he
 Several other works, including commentaries from Kushayari, Dayalam, Shirazi and Suhrawardy, emerged from the 11th century
 in kaaryon main sulaami kii kitabon or lekhak ke yogadan se saamagree shaamil he
 Many works have been written in Persian such as the works of Mabri Kashf al-asrar
 rumi ne apni pustak mathnavi main vishaal rahasyamay kavita likhi thi
 Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in the translation of Rumi's work
 mathnavi main badi sankhya main kuranik maarg paae ja sakate hai, jinamein se kuch quran kii ek sufi vyakhya par vichaar karte hai
 Rumi's book is not exceptional for quotations and elaborations on the Quran, however, Rumi mentions the Quran more often
 simnani ne quran par gudh exegesis ke do prabhaavshaalee kaaryon ko likhaa tha
 He reconciled the sentiments of Sunni Islam with the ideas and manifestations of God in the material world
 18 veen shatabdi main ismail haaki bursavi ke kaam jaise vyapak sufi tippaniyan dikhaai detii hai
 His work Ruh al-bayan is a huge marifat
 arabi main likhaa gaya he, yah lekhak ke apane vichaaron ko unke purvavartiyon ke saath jodta he

 This miraculous form of the Qur'an is for us today and may be another miraculous form of it for the time to come
 jis samay koran avtarit hua us yug main uskaa mukhya chamatkaar uskaa vaigyanik aadhaar nahin tha
 The miracle of the Quran in that era was its language, literature, eloquence, which shook the language knowledge of the Arabs of its time
 yahaan spasht karnaa uchit hoga ki us samay ke arabon ko apane bhashaa gyaan par itnaa garv tha ki ve shesh vishwa ke logon ko ajami kehete the

 There is another hadith mentioned in Tabrani, which states that one day when a person was brought to the Hazur Mosque, he saw some people reading the Quran sitting in a corner and explaining to each other

 You reached that group of Sahaba and said to them - Do you believe that there is no other Mabud except Allah, i am the Messenger of Allah and the Quran is the book of Allah? Sahaba said, or Rasul Allah we testify that there is no Mabud except Allah, you are the Rasool of Allah and the Quran is the Book of Allah

 Here Muslims were introduced to two new types of people

 But when he saw the last prophet in his second demise, he created a ruckus

 a chanting mala or mala is a string of prayer bead strings commonly used by Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and some Sikhs in prayer to a spiritual practice known as chanting in Sanskrit
 yah aamtaur par 108 manako se bani hoti he, haalanki anya sankhyaon kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he
 The garland is used to keep count while reciting, chanting or mentally repeating the name or names of the mantra or deity
 mantro ko aamtaur par sau yaa hazaron baar dohraye jate hai
 Mala is used so that one can focus on the meaning or sound of the mantra instead of counting its repetition
 aamtaur par prayek manakaa ke chaaron ore dakshinavart anguuthe ko ghumaate hue prayek manakaa ke liye ek duharaav kaha jaataa he, haalanki kuch paramparaayen yaa prathaen vamavart gati yaa vishisht ungali ke upyog ke liye kah sakati hai
 When someone reaches the main bead, turn the rosary and start again from the opposite direction
 prayek manake ke bich aam taur par ganth hoti hai 
 This makes the use of beads easier because the bead will not be tight on the wire when using
 yadi 108 se adhik doharaav kiye jane hai, to kabhi-kabhi tibeti paramparaon main chaaval ke dane ko jap karne se pehle gina jaataa he or prayek 108 duharaav ke liye katore main ek dana rakhaa jaataa he
 Each time a repeat of the entire garland is completed, a grain of rice is taken out of the bowl
 aksar sadhana karne vaale, aamtaur par das ke taron main apni maala main atirikt counter jodate hai 
 These can be placed differently depending on the tradition, for example some traditions place these strings after every 10th bead
 yah badi sankhyaon kaa dhyaan rakhane kaa ek vaikalpik tarika he, kabhi-kabhi saikadon hajaaron or yahaan tak ki lakhon main bhi jaataa he
 The 109th bead on the garland is called Sumeru, Bindu, Stupa or Guru Bead
 ginati hameshaa sumeru ke bagal main ek manakaa ke saath shuru honi chahie 
 In Hindu, Vedic tradition, if more than one repetition garland is to be performed, the person changes direction when he reaches Sumeru instead of crossing it
 kai spashtikaran hai ki kyon 108 manakaa hai, jisamen sankhya 108 manakaa kai hindu or buddha paramparaon main vishesh dharmik mahatv rakhte hai 
 Thus when we read or recite the number 108, we are actually remembering the whole universe
 yah hamen is tathy kii yaad dilaataa he ki brahmad swayan sarvyaapee he, yah swayan kii sahaj prakruti he
 Some Hindu traditions believe that the correct way to use a garland is with the right hand, a bead with the thumb pushed forward with the other hand, and the garland is draped over the middle finger
 tarjani ungali ahankaar kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, aatm-prapti ke liye sabase badi baadha, isliye maala par jap karte samay ise sabase acchhee tarah taala ja saktaa hai 
 In the Shakta traditions in northeastern India, particularly in West Bengal and Assam, the garland is often draped over the ring finger of the right hand, with the bead curled forward from the middle ring finger with the help of the thumb and avoiding the use of the index finger
 haalanki bich kii ungali par maala daalana or manakaa ko ghumaane ke liye anguuthe kaa upyog karnaa in kshetron main bhi sweekaarya he
 Different types of materials are used to make the beads of the garland
 rudraksh vriksh ke beej se bane moti ko shaiva, shiv ke bhakton dwaara pavitra mana jaataa he, jabaki tulsi paudhe kii lakdi se bane moti kaa vaishnav, vishnu ke anuyaayi dwaara upyog or sammanit kiya jaataa hai
 Other common bead include the wood or bodhi tree of the sandalwood tree, and the seeds of the lotus plant
 kuch tibeti buddha paramparaayen jaanwaron kii haddi kaa upyog karte hai jo pichley lamas ke sabase moolyawaan hai
 Semi-precious stones such as carnelian and amethyst can also be used
 hindu tantra ke saath-saath buddha tantra main, saamagree or manakaa ke rang ek vishisht abhyaas se sambandhit ho sakate hai
