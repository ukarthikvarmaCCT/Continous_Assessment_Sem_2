 The history of Mastani's early life is controversial and mainly based on legends
 sushila vaidya ke anusaar 18veen shatabdi ke purv madhyakaal main maratha itihaas main mastaani kaa vishesh ullekh miltaa he
 Bakhar and articles suggest that Mastani was of Afghan and Gujar caste
 inkaa janm nrity karanevaali jati main hua tha
 In the songs of Gujarat, he is addressed as 'nrityangana' or 'yavan Kanchani'
 vastutah yah vivaran sushila vaidya ne alp gyaat sroton ke aadhaar par likhaa he
 In fact, this topic has been highly controversial
 suprasiddh itihaaskaar govind sakhaaraam saradesai ne likhaa he ki mastaani kaa vansh agyaat he
 She is traditionally called the child of a Hindu father and a Muslim mother
 vastutah mastaani ke mata pita tathaa kul aadi ke sambandh main nishchit rup se kuch kahana kathin he
 Contemporary writers have expressed conflicting views in this regard
 bajirao ke ek pracheen jivan charitra ke anusaar mastaani hyderabad ke nizaam kii putree thi
 The Nawab's begum urged him to marry Bajirao so that nizam-bajirao's friendship could become permanent
 vivaah sanskaar sampann kiya gaya par pratyaksh bajirao se nahin varan uske khanjar se
 Later, Bajirao called him to him
 kuch anya lekhakon ke anusaar mastaani maharaja chhatrasaal kii ek rakhel kii putree thi
 Mastani was also one of them when she gave him many gifts for the help given by Bajirao
 kuch or lekhakon ne keval itnaa hi likhaa he ki vah hindu mata or muslim pita kii putree thi
 Dr
 Bhagwan Das Gupta also believes that no reliable details are available regarding Mastani's early life
 adhiktar yahi dharna prachlit he ki chhatrasaal ne hi use peshwa ko bhent kiya tha
 According to the Bundelkhandi folklore, she was a girl born to the Mughalani deputy wife of Chhatrasal
 bajirao peshwa evam mastaani kii prem-katha par aadhaarit nagnath inaamdaar ke suprasiddh marathi upanyaas rau, jo ki saphaltam aitihaasik upanyaason main se ek he, ke anuvadak om shivaraj ne kuch naveen jaankaree ke anusaar mastaani ke multah hindu hone kii baat kahi he or bataaya he ki uskaa naam multah madan kunwari tha
 He has written that little literature has been written in Hindi regarding Madan Kunwari and Bajirao Peshwa
 marathi main jinhone bhi is vishay par likhaa he un sabhi ne madan kunwari mastaani ko musalmaan or bajirao kii rakhel mana he
 But this is not true
 shri sudhindra verma ne apni pustak main madan kunwari kaa parichay diya he
 Madan Kunwari was the daughter of Hammir Singh, a soldier of Orchha King
 hamir singh bundela thakur tha
 He was married to Khangar thakur-kanya
 isi baat par bundele thakuron ne hammir singh ko jati se bahishkrut kar diya tha
 Hammirsingh lived in a hut near the Chaturbhuj temple on the banks of the Betwa River in Orchha
 uski jhonpadi ke paas hi ek jhonpadi main vruddh rahamaan rahata tha
 He was a singer
 vah darbar main or sabhaaon main gaata tha
 He was the only one
 usne shaadi nahin kii thi
 Both Hammir Singh and Rahman were close friends
 madan kunwari mast mizaaj kii ladki thi
 She was the playful Alhar, Param Rupavati and Kokilakanthi
 hammir singh ko geet-sangeet sunne kaa bada shauk tha
 The two friends would sit together in the evening and spend time in music
 madan kunwari bhi gane kii shaukeen ho gayi thi
 Mastani was proficient in the unique beauty and musical art of his time
 inhone ghudsawaari or teerandaji main bhi shiksha praapt kii thi
 According to Sushila Vaidya, the first visits of Naib Subedar Shujaat Khan and Mastani of Gujarat took place around 1724 AD
 chimaji appa ne usee varsh shujgat khan par akraman kiya
 Shujaat Khan died in the battle field itself
 luti hui saamagree ke saath mastaani bhi chimaji appa ko praapt hui
 Chimaji Appa brought him to Bajirao
 taduparant mastaani or bajirao ek duusare ke liye hi jivit rahe
 In 1727, Muhammad Khan Bangash, the Subedar of Prayag, attacked King Chhatrasal
 raja chhatrasaal ne turant hi peshwa bajirao se sahaayta maangi
 Bajirao along with his army marched towards Bundelkhand
 mastaani bhi bajirao ke saath gai
 The Marathas and the Mughals fought for two years
 tatpashchaat bajirao jite
 Chhatrasal was very happy
 unhone mastaani ko apni putree ke samaan mana
 In this description too, excerpts related to Mastani are written by Sushila Vaidya only on the basis of little known sources, because Govind Sakharam Sardesai has clearly written that the first mention of his name is in the authentic letters of the marriage accounts of Bajirao's eldest son Nana Saheb
 yah vivaah 11 janvari 1730 isvi ko hua tha
 In the same year, Bajirao built his 'shani Bhawan' in Pune
 apane upanyaas rau swami main nagnath inaamdaar ne bhi puri tarah aitihaasikta ke anuroop isi samay se katha kaa aarambh kiya he
 In the said building, where Bajirao arranged for Mastani's stay, he has been named 'mastani Mahal' and 'mastani Darwaza'
 mastaani anindya sundari thi
 She was cultured, artistic and tactful
 vah bajirao se anany prem karti thi
 She was not only proficient in dancing and singing, but was also proficient in skilled cavalry and armaments
 peshwa ke mahal main hone vaale ganesh utsav ke avasar par saarvajanik samarohon main uskaa gayan hua karata tha
 She also lived with Bajirao in military campaigns
 vah ghode par savaar hokar sena main bajirao ke saath chalati thi
 Bajirao loved her so much that he did not let her get away from him even for a moment
 mastaani ek hindu patni kii tarah rahati thi
 She used to live in Hindu costumes even when she was a Muslim
 vah bajirao ke aaraam, uski aavashyaktaaon tathaa uske sukh kaa puraa dhyaan rakhti thi
 How did the then society tolerate the Peshwa of the Hindu religion-defying Maratha state falling into the love-loop of a Muslim woman? That is why his family members were also angry with him
 uski patni kashibai bhi apane prati uske udasin vyavhaar se badi dukhi rahaa karti thi
 Bajirao's anti-sardar used to propagate his and Mastani's love against him and tried to make him fall in the eyes of the people
 bajirao maance or madiraa kaa seven karne laga tha
 This was a taboo in the Brahmin society of Maharashtra
 logon kaa kahana tha ki mastaani ke sampark kaa hi yah parinaam tha
 The Brahmin community had in a way considered Bajirao to be impure
 is sandarbh main suprasiddh itihaaskaar govind sakhaaraam saradesai ne doordarshita evam sahanubhuti se vichaar kiya he
 He has written that according to the general public, Bajirao's love for meat and wines was due to Mastani's company
 parantu bajirao sadrush vyakti, jisko ek sainik kaa jivan vyateet karnaa padataa tha, brahman jati ke kathor niyamon kaa paalan nahin kar saktaa tha, kyonki sabhi prakaar ke logon se uskaa swatantraapurvak milanaa hota tha
 This sudden change was natural and inevitable in the narrow prohibitive life of a Brahmin from Maharashtra, as he had to march to remote areas and come in contact with Rajput courts, where drinking, non-vegetarian and smoking were frequent
 bajirao kii kamiyon kaa ek sutara yah he
 There was undoubtedly a great change in Maratha society during his period
 bajirao se sambandh ke kaaran mastaani ko bhi anek du:kha jhelane pade par bajirao ke prati uskaa prem atoot tha
 Mastani had a son in 1734 AD
 uskaa naam shamsher bahadur rakhaa gaya
 Bajirao announced the giving of Kalpi and Banda to him
 1739 i0 ke aarambh main peshwa bajirao or mastaani kaa sambandh viched karaane ke asafal praytn kiye gaye
 In the last days of 1739 AD, Bajirao had to leave Poona for necessary work
 mastaani peshwa ke saath na ja saki
 Chimaji Appa and Nana Saheb planned harshly towards Mastani
 unhone mastaani ko parvati baag main kaid kiya
 When Bajirao got this news, he was very sad
 ve biimaar pad gaye
 Meanwhile, Avasa Pa Mastani escaped from captivity and reached Patas near Bajirao on 4 November 1739 AD
 bajirao nishcint hue, par yah sthiti adhik dinon tak na rah saki
 Soon Purandare, Kaka Morshet and other persons reached Patas
 unke saath peshwa bajirao kii maan radhabai or unki patni kashibai bhi vahaan pahaunchi
 He deemed it necessary to bring Mastani out
 mastaani puna lauti
 The fundamentalists wanted to kill Mastani, because according to him the origin of all the trouble was the same
 un logon ne chhatrapati se ajna bhi lene kaa praytn kiya, parantu chhatrapati raja shahu adhik budhimaan the
 His officer Govindrao wrote in a letter on 24 January 1740 AD - i have personally ascertained the will of the king on the subject of Mastani
 balpurvak pruthakkaran yaa vyaktigat nirodh ke prastaav ke prati us ko gambhir aapatti he
 He will not tolerate Bajirao being unhappy in any way, because he always wants to keep him happy
 dosha us mahila kaa nahin he
 This defect can be resolved only when Bajirao has such a wish
 bajirao kii bhaawanaaon ke viruddh hinsa prayog kii kisi bhi salaah raja kisi bhi kaaran nahin de saktaa
 In the early 1740 AD, Bajirao set out to fight Nasirjung and crossed the Godavari river and brought the enemy in a bad position near Aurangabad
 27 farvari 1740 i0 ko mungi shegaanv main donon ke bich sandhi ho gayi
 This last campaign of Bajirao's life proved to be
 us samay koi nahin jaanata tha ki bajirao kii mrityu sannikat he
 Chimna ji's letter to Nanasaheb on 7 March 1740 AD suggests that Bajirao was ill with heart
 chimna ji ne is patr main likhaa tha ki jab se ham ek duusare se vidaa hue hai, mujhako poojaneey raav se koi samachar praapt nahin hua he
 i tried to calm his deranged mind as much as possible, but it seems that God's will is something else
 main nahin jaanata hum ki hamaara kya hone vaala he
 We should send it to him as soon as i return to Pune
 spasht he ki bajirao atyant vyakul tha
 He had mental distress and anger against Mastani and his inability to free her
 28 april 1740 isvi ko apni pehali or antim beemaari se uski mrityu hui
 At this time Bajirao was only 42 years old
 uski mrityu ke samay uske paas uski kshamashil patni kashibai bhi thi
 According to Kincaid and Parsnis Mastani became sati with her beloved
 unhone likhaa he ki is sansar main vah apane priyatam se alag kii gayi thi
 She passed through fiery flames to welcome him to another world
 haalanki yah baat vivaadaaspad he
 It is difficult to say whether she committed suicide or died of bereavement
 uskaa shav pabal bheja gaya, jo puna ke purab main lagbhag 20 mile par ek chota sa gaanv he
 This village was awarded to him by Bajirao
 yahan par ek saadhaaran-si kabr aane-jane waalon ko uski prem-katha tathaa dukhad mrityu kaa samaran dilaati he
 She was unanimously the most beautiful of her time

 The concept of ecological footprint and method of calculation was developed in 1990–1994 at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, under the supervision of Rees, phd dissertation of Methis Wackernagel
 mulat: vaikaranajel or ris ne is avadharana ko "apropreated kariing capacity" kaha
 To make the concept more accessible, Rees introduced the name "ecological footprint", inspired by a computer technician's appreciation of his new computer's "small footprint on the table"

 This resource accounting is similar to life cycle analysis in which energy, biofuels, building materials, water and other resources are converted into generalized measurements of land, known as 'global hectares'

 Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for self-sustaining economies
