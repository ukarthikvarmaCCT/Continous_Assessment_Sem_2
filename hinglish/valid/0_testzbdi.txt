 Although originally it was thought to combine the Mahar soldiers of Maharashtra, it is the only regiment of the Indian Army that is made up of soldiers from all communities and regions of India
 mahaar scouts or unki sena kile main sainikon ke rup main maratha raja shivaji dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 They were recruited by the East India Company Company in the sixth part of the Bombay Army to form a large part of the company
 bombay sena unki bahaduree or dhvaj ke prati vafadari ke liye mahaar sainikon isht or isliye bhi kyonki ve angl-maratha yuddh ke dauraan par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he
 They have achieved many successes, including in the Battle of Koregaon, where the Mahar-dominated company troops were defeated under the leadership of a much larger Peshwa Bajirao II
 yah ladaai ek obilisk, koregaanv stambh he, jo bhartiya swatantraaa jab tak mahaar regiment ke shikhar par chapa rup main janaa dwaara manaaya gaya
 The Mahar soldiers of the Bombay Army saw action in the [indian Rebellion of 1857], and joined the two regiments The rebellion under the British war of this regiment is "bolo Hindustan ki Jai"
 vidroh ke baad bhartiya sena ke british adhikariyon, vishesh rup se jo pratham or dwitiya afgaan yuddh main seva kii thi, marshall daud siddhant ke liye mudra dene ke liye shuru kiya
 It was theorized that some Indians were naturally warlike between castes and communities, and more suited to war than others
 is siddhant kaa ek pramukh prastaavak lard roberts, jo november 1885 main commander-in-chif ke bhartiya sena ke ban rahe anya samudaayon kii haani ke liye dhire-dhire bhartiya sena ke 'punjabisation "tha
 The final blow to the Mahar soldiers came in 1892 when it was decided to institute "class regiments" in the Indian Army
 maharon in varg regimenton main shaamil nahin the, or yah adhishuchet kiya gaya tha ki maharon, kuch anya virgon ke saath ke bich, ab bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gaye the
 The Mahar soldiers, who included 104 Viceroy commissioned officers and a host of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, were demobilized
 is ghatana ko ek sarkari ve ek sau se adhik varshon ke liye kaam kiya tha dwaara apni vafadari kii ek vishwasghaat ke rup main maharon ne mana gaya tha
 After the demobilization of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilised
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 BR Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganization of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, B
 R
 Ambedkar was appointed to the Defence Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col V
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer Mentioned in dispatches
 They also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Centre was established at Kamptee
 Following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 Their entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 The flying Spaghetti demon is the god of Pastafari religion
 ise america ke sarkari vidyalayon main intellegent dizine or crieshnism padhaane kaa virodh karne ke liye san 2005 main banaaya gaya tha
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki is dharm ke anuyaayi ise ek asli dharm bataate hai, par media main ise ek vyangy dharm kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The first description of the flying Spaghetti monster is found in a satirical letter written in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to the Board of Education of the State of Kansas, USA
 is chitthee se ve board dwaara vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas ke sthaan par intellegent dizine padhaane kii anumati die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai

 It is often found that an animal is so similar to a natural object that it is understood by illusion

 In the above examples, the purpose of incorporation is to avoid enemies, that is, defense

 Examples of such habitual analogy are found in carnivorous animals

 ve keet jo un pushpon par jate hai, in makadon ko pahchaan nahin pate or inke bhojya ban jate hai
 Some zoologists consider the resemblance of animals to natural objects, such as roots and leaves, but most biologists consider the occurrence as a separate phenomenon
 ve kisi jantujati ke kuch sadasyon ke ek bhinn jantu jati ke sadrush hone ko hi anuharan kehete hai
 Many animals that are distasteful or poisonous in food and can be harmful when irritated, are brightly colored and have special marks on their body
 isliye unke shatru unako turant pahchaan lete hai or unhen nahin chhedate
 Some animals which do not have any special means of defense
 in hanikaarak or abhyakrami jantuon ke samaan hi chatak rang ke hote hai tathaa unke sharir par bhi vaise hi chihn hote hai or dhokhe main unase bhi shatru bhaagate hai : udhaaharan:, kai ek ahaanikar jati ke sarp pravalsarpon kii bhanti ranjit tathaa chihnit hote hai; isi prakaar kuch ahaanikar bhring dekhne main bure ke sadrush hote hai or kuch shalab madhumakhi ke sadrush hote hai or is prakaar unke shatru unhen nahin pakadte
 The markings on the body of distasteful and poisonous animals and the style of colors and their bright colors are intended to warn
 unke shatru kuch anubhav ke pashchaat unpar akraman karnaa chhod dete hai
 Members of other castes who mimic the color form of such malefic castes are deemed to be disadvantaged

 Wallace had a similar experience with some butterflies in the eastern territories
 pepilio pulitas titali kii maadaaen teen prakaar kii hoti hai
 Some resemble the male butterfly appearance, some resemble papilio aristolokii, and some resemble papelio hector and resemble the many different butterflies found in the same country
 in ghatnaon se yah gyaat hota he ki ve titliyaan jo apane hinskon ke liye aruchikar bhojan nahin hai, un titliyon kaa rangarup dhaaran kar leti hai jo apane shatruon ko khaane main aruchikar gyaat hoti hai 
 Zoologists say that the peculiar color of the wings of distasteful butterflies has evolved due to the effect of natural selection on the visual markings and special paintings on their fathers
 unke chihn aise hai ki unke shatru unako sahaj main hi pahchaan lete hai or anubhav ke pashchaat in titliyon ko aruchikar jaanakar inhen maarna band kar dete hai
 These figures have always had special value in the struggle for life, because in this struggle there were means of defense
 isi kaaran ye viksit hue
 The development of markings and painting similar to the feathers of uninteresting butterflies on the wings of interesting butterflies also developed due to the influence of natural choice, as the color contours could be a means of protecting them in life struggle

 in prvraji titliyon kaa rup tathaa aakaar purvi danneaini anuvansh kii titliyon kaa sa hota he or uttari america or africa kii titliyon kii kuch jatiyaan unka anuharan karti hai
 It has been observed that females follow more than males
 jab nar or maadaa donon hi anuharan karte hai to maadaa nar kii apeksha anukrit ke adhik samaan hoti he 
 In this regard, it is worth remembering that the female butterfly has a higher fertility than the male
 spasht he ki maadaa main parivartanshkyata adhik hone ke kaaran, prakritik chunaav kaa kaary adhik sugam ho jaataa he or parinaam adhi santoshjanak hota he, arthath anukaari adhik maatra main anukrit se samaan hota he
 The above examples are of Batesian tracing
 yah naam isliye padaa he ki ise sarppratham betsi ne gyaat kiya tha
 But after this investigation, another strange phenomenon related to this was known to the experts
 yah dekha gaya ki kuch bhinn-bhinn, aruchikar tathaa hanikar jatiyon kii titliyon ke rang, rup, aakaar bhi ek samaan hai
 It is clear that castes which are self-interested and malevolent have no need to imitate any other malevolent caste
 yah dekha gaya ki ithomiini or helliconini anuvansh kii titliyaan, jo donon hi aruchikar kehete hai, kyonki isaki santoshjanak vyakhya fits mular ne kii
 Müller has stated that the butterflies of all the castes participate in this kind of ritual, all of them benefit from life
 yah spasht he ki titliyon ke shutraon dwaara is baat kaa anubhav praapt karne main ki amuk rup rang kii titliyaan hanikar hai, bahut si titliyon kii jaan jaati hai
 When many of the butterflies of a distasteful caste take the same color or form, the life-threatening compulsory education of the enemies is divided among many castes and the amount of life is less for any one caste
 wales ke anusaar prayek anuharan main paanch baaten honi chahie

 Some reproductive experiments have also been done on the butterflies that have been reproduced

 It is also present in male, but its effect is not followed by another suppressive pitrack present in male
 unke matanusaar aisa saadrishy ek sthaan ke rahanevaale vanshon main paryaavaran yaa langik chunaav ke prabhaav se, athwa maansik anubhav ke pratichaar ke kaaran utpann ho jaataa he
 But on these grounds, all the phenomena of the intergenerational analogy cannot be explained

 Real gases deviate greatly from the ideal gas equation, which was later confirmed by Naterer, Sendreuse, and Keane, using more pressure
 andrus ke prayog moulik mahatv ke hai kyonki ve gaison ke vaastavik vyavhaar par bahut prakaash daalate hai or us mahatvapurn avasthaa sameekaran ke aadhaar hai jiskaa pratipaadan vandervals ne kiya he
 The condition equation of vandarwals is as follows: jahaan a { \ displaystyle a} evam b { \ displaystyle b} niyatank hai jo gas vishesh par nirbhar karte hai
 Their value can be derived from the revolutionary properties
 p c , t c { \ displaystyle p_{c},t_{c}} evam v c { \ displaystyle V_{c}} You can also write it this way- san 1873 main prastaavit is sameekaran se adarsh gas sameekaran kii apeksha kaaphi behatar parinaam mili
 In this equation, a { \ displaystyle a} is called the attraction parameter and b { \ displaystyle b} is the repulsion parameter or effective molecular volume
 yah sameekaran adarsh gas avasthaa se honevaale adhikansh vichalnon kaa samaadhaan kar detaa he
 Several other state observations have been proposed

 Yet given the simplicity of this equation, it is generally sufficiently close to the behavior of real gases

 The second trend was to determine the rights, political place and social status of man

 The third trend was that big Bhupathis started exercising political power in their territories

 Each feudal prince had several Vesols under him, who were restricted to give him advice and aid in war
 ’’ According to Mr
 Lucus, both the king and the feudal had a mutual contract, the basis of which was mutual exchange

 Mr
 Bewster, while highlighting the form of feudalism in his dictionary, wrote that "it was a political system which was based on the mutual relations of the king and the feudal land and in which service and respect was owned by the recipient of the land, assistance
 , Incidents of marriage etc
 were prominent
 ’’ In the Chambers Encyclopedia, feudalistic beliefs emphasize Swami devotion and obedience, saying that the word "feudalism, though a type of social order, mainly describes the relations between individuals who own land rights and personal property
" On the basis of a person's subordination to another person, however it is based on that individual relationship and rules Which refers to the elegant method is the protection and maintenance and follow the other hand serve and obey

 " "sarvoday aisi samaajarachna chahta he gimen varna, varg, dharm, jati, bhashaa aadi ke aadhaar par kisi samudaay kaa na to sanhaar ho, na bahishkaar ho

 vinoba kehete hai-"sarvoday kii drushti se jo samaaj rachana hogi, uskaa aarambh apane jivan se karnaa hoga
 Sarvodaya will not happen if untruth, violence, accession etc
 occur in private life, because Sarvodaya wants to eradicate the inequality of society with non-violence

 Trusteeship plans to benefit from genetic rites - says Vinoba - "" Asymmetry of property arises due to artificial arrangement, leave it as if the inequality of human physical and intellectual power cannot be completely overcome
 
 shikshan or niyaman se yah vishmata kuch ansh tak kam kii ja sakati
 But the absolute absence of this asymmetry in the ideal situation cannot be imagined
 isliye sharir, buddhi or sampatti in teenon main se jo jise praapt ho, use yahi samajhnaa chahie ki vah sabake hit ke liye hi mili he

 This is the path to Sarvodaya

 Private ownership is capitalism, government ownership is communism
 poonjeewaad main shoshan he, samyawad main daman
 The tradition of India, its genius and its condition, all three require that they develop a third method of political and economic organization, so as to benefit from the "private aggression" of capitalism and the "collective interest" of communism, but their Defects can be avoided

 vichaarwaad yaa adarshavaad yaa pratyaywad un vichaaron or manyataon kii samekit vichaardhaara he jinke anusaar is jagat kii samast vasteen vichaar yaa chetana kii abhivyakti he
 The essence of creation is not the root matter but the basic consciousness
 adarshavaad jadta yaa bhautikwaad kaa vipareet rup prastut karata he
 It forms the basis for the principle of the spiritual-non-material being primary and the physical being secondary, which makes it closer to the roots of religion in relation to the finiteness of the world and the creation of the world by God
 adarshavaad chetana ko prakruti se alag karke dekhtaa he, jiske falswaroop vah maanav chetana or sangyaan kii prakriya ko anivarytah rahasyamay banaata he or aksar sanshaywad tathaa agyeyavaad kii taraf badhane lagata he
 According to some thinkers, the major distinction between munusya and other beings is that man can use suffixes and other beings do not have this ability
 kutta do manushyon ko dekhtaa he, parantu 2 ko usne kabhi nahin dekha
 There are two types of suffixes - scientific and moral
 sankhya, gun, maatra aadi vaigyanik pratyayon kaa astitv to asandigdh he, parantu naitik pratyayon kaa astitv vivaad kaa vishay bana rahaa he
 We say- 'today the weather is very good'
 yahan ham achchhepan kaa varnan karte hai or iske saath achchhai ke adhik nune hone kii ore sanket karte hai
 a similar distinction is also made with respect to deeds
 naitik pratyay ko adarsh bhi kehete hai
 Ideal is a situation which- kuch log mulya ko maanav kalpana kaa pad hi dete hai
 The object that attracts us for some reason is valuable or gentle in our eyes
 iske vipareet afalaatoon ke vichaar main pratyay yaa adarsh hi vaastavik astitv rakhte hai, drusht vastuon kaa astitv to chaaya maatr he
 According to a third view, which Aristotle represents, the ideal is not the beginning of reality, but the 'end'
 'niti' ke aarambh main hi vah kahata he ki sari vastuen adarsh kii ore chal rahi hai
 Prices distinguish high and low
 jab ham kehete hai ki 'k', 'kha' se uttam he, tab hamaara aashay yahi hota he ki sarvottam se kha kii apeksha k kaa antar thodaa he
 The basis of price comparison is the best
 ise 'nickshreyas' kehete hai
 The main question in the policy was to understand the nature of Disarm or Best Price for ancient Greece and India
 nickshreyas yaa sarvocch adarsh ke swaroop ke sambandh main sabhi isse sahamat hai ki yah chetana se sambhddha he, parantu jyon hi ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki chetana main koun sa ansh sadhymoolya he, tyonhi matbhed prastut ho jaataa he
 Some people say that the consumption of happiness is such a value
 kuch gyaan, budhimatta, prem yaa shivasankalp ko yah pad dete hai
 Some take refuge in pluralism in this option, and say that more than one thing is mediocre
 To decide whether or not an object is mediocre, Dr
 Moore has suggested the following: Imagine the complete equality of the two alternatives
 Is, except that a particular object exists in a dislocation
 in donon viplvon main tumhaari buddhi kiske astitv ko adhik upyukt samajhati he? jo vastu aisi sthiti main ek viplav ko duusare se adhik upyukt banaati he, vah sadhymoolya hai
 The existence of values, the distinction between superiority and the existence of the best value is the fundamental notion of idealism
 isse sambhddha kuch anya dharanaayen bhi adarshavaadiyon ke liye maanya hai
 Of these, we will consider three here: in teenon dharanaon par tanik vichaar kii aavashyaktaa he
 The distinction between the common and the special is reflected in the controversy of selfishness and servitude
 bhogavaad ne swaarth se aarambh kiya, parantu sheeghra hi iske dhyey main swaarth ne sthaan praapt kar liya
 The ultimate aim of man is to consume more and more numbers
 duusari ore kaant ne bhi kaha ki nirpeksh aadesh kii drushti main saare manushya ek samaan saadhy hai, koi manushya bhi saadhan maatr nahin
 Like death, moral life eradicates all distinctions
 koi manushya kartavya se upar nahin, koi adhikaron se vanchit nahin
 Kant's statement on this subject is famous: In the world and beyond it, we cannot contemplate anything other than Shiva's resolution, which is unconditional or gentle without any condition
 jon stuart mil jaise sukhwadi ne bhi kaha, trupt boar se atrupt sucraat hona uttam he
 Mill did not see that in this acceptance, he moved away from his theory and supported idealism
 sucraat main aisa aadhyatmik ansh he jo boar main vidyaman nahin
 Thomas Hill Green has sought to explain in detail that modern moral sentiment has advanced much further than the spirit of ancient Greece in these two things — the distinction between man and man has diminished and the spiritual aspect of life is progressing
 kaant ke vichaar main maanav prakruti main pramukh ansh 'naitik bhaavana' kaa he, vah anubhav karata he ki karttavyapaalan kii maang shesh sabhi maangon se adhik adhikaar rakhti he, naitik aadesh 'nirpeksh aadesh' he
 With this acceptance, acceptance of moral independence also becomes mandatory
 'tumhen karnaa chahie, isliye tum kar sakate ho
 In the absence of merit, the question of responsibility cannot arise
 yahan ek kathin sthiti prastut ho jaati haih naitik adarsh shreshthatam kii siddhi he yaa uski ore chalate janaa he? jis avasthaa ko ham shreshthatam samajhate hai, use praapt karne par use shreshthatam hi pate hai
 Wherever we arrive, error and imperfection remain
 swayan kaant ne kaha he ki hamaara antim uddeshy purnataa he or isaki siddhi ke liye anant kaal kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some thinkers say that some degree of imperfection must remain
 sorto apni prasiddh pustak 'naitik mulya' main kahata haih 'kalpana karo ki saare mulyon kii siddhi ho gai he
 What will happen to the policy if this happens? There will be no ideal to move forward
 safalataa saare praytn kaa ant kar degi or is tarah siddhi praapt naitik adarsh jivan ko purna karne main samaapt kar degaa
 Because of this difficulty, Bradley stated that there is an internal conflict in moral life: the end of all moral effort is its own killing
 shiksha adikaal se hi vibhinn darshanik vichaardhaaraon se prabhavit hoti chali aa rahi he, kintu is par sabase adhik prabhaav adarshavaad kaa padaa he
 The names of Plato, Comenius, Pestologie and Froebel are particularly notable among those who gave prominence to idealism in the field of education
 adarshavaadiyon ke anusaar shiksha ek ‘chetana' athwa 'bauddhik prakriya’ he jo ki balak main sadgunon kaa vikaas kar use ek prakritik praani se aadhyatmik praani banaati hai
 Cultural traditions and knowledge are the means to accomplish this activity
 is kriya kaa ‘saadhy kaa lakshya’ chaatr ko aatmanubhuti karne kaa avasar pradaan karnaa tathaa unka charitra nirmaan karnaa hota he
 Thus, according to the idealistic ideology, education is the conscious and intellectual process in which the disciple is given self-realization by the Guru
 shiksha kii is avadharana se pataa chalata he ki shiksha koi ekangi prakriya nahin he apitu do dhuravon ke madhya chalane vaali prakriya he jisamen ek dhurav shikshaarthi he jisaki mul prakruti kaa parishkar kiya jaataa he tathaa doosraa dhurav shikshak hota he jo balak kii mul prakruti kaa ‘shodhan’ evam margtarikaran kar use shaashvat mulyon evam aadarshon se avgat karaata he taaki vah prakritik praani se aadhyatmik praani main parivartit ho sake
 According to the idealists, the ultimate aim of human life is to know the ultimate form of the soul-god, this is called self-realization, attainment of ideal personality, attainment of God and attainment of ultimate joy
 aatma-paramatma ke charam swaroop ko jaanane ke liye adarshavaadiyon ke anusaar manushya ko chaar sopan paar karne hote hai
 On the first step, he has to develop his 'natural self'
 duusare sopan par use apane ‘saamaajik swa’ kaa vikaas karnaa hota he
 On the third step, he has to develop his 'mental self' and on the last step he has to develop his 'spiritual self'
 adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke anusaar maanav praani ishwar kii sarvotkrisht rachana he jisko usne aseemit shaktiyaan pradaan kii hai
 The personality is formed by the sum of these different strengths and abilities
 isiilie adarshavaadi vichaarak vyaktitv ko ooncha uthaanaa athwa usamen nihit vibhinn sarvocch shaktiyon evam kshamtaaon kaa prakatikaran evam achche maarg kii ore le janaa hi shiksha kaa uddeshy maanate hai
 It is clear that the personality of a person is important and 'soul' has special importance than the physical body of a person
 isliye adarshavaad ke anusaar maanav-jivan kaa uddeshy isi ‘aatma’ kaa bodh karnaa he
 Self-revelation is also necessary for self-realization
 aatm prakaashan ke liye ‘saamaajik swa’ ko viksit karnaa aavashyak he
 The development of social self means - man follows the rules accepted by the society, his choice depends on social acceptance and rejection
 adarshavaadi yah maanate hai ki manushya kii sabase badi visheshta uski samskruti he, rahan-sahan, reeti rivaaj, bhashaa sahitya, kala sangeet evam mulya hai
 These only lead him from natural 'self' to social self, to establish a well-adjusted adjustment with society and environment, one must get the opportunity of 'self-revelation'
 aatm prakaashan ke liye ‘bauddhik swa’ kaa vikaas aavashyak he
 This is the situation when a person's behavior is not controlled by social acceptance-rejection, but controlled by his intelligence and conscience
 plato kaa vichaar he ki manushya kii buddhi evam vivek uske samast aadarshon, krityon evam aadhyatmik cheshtaaon kaa aadhaar hote hai
 Without wisdom there cannot be knowledge, without knowledge there cannot be wisdom and without wisdom one cannot distinguish true-untruth, Shiva-ashiva and Sundar-asunder and Satya Shivam Sundaram cannot be attained
 aatmanubhuti se ham vaastavik satya kaa darshan karte hai
 Idealists believe that when a man rises above his 'natural self' and 'social self' and starts controlling himself in his 'intellectual self', then he gradually starts to enter the realm of 'spiritual self'
 plato kaa vichaar he ki manushya kii pravriti satyam, shivan tathaa sundaram kii taraf jhuki hoti he
 He is always in search of truth and accepts what is welfare and beautiful and renounces what is not welfare and beautiful
 adarshavaadi manushya ko is prakriya main prashikshit karne par bal dete hai
 To achieve the above goal, it is necessary to bring about a change in attitude
 is bhautik jagat ke nanaatv se mukti hi shiksha kaa lakshya hona chahie
 It is also said that arthath vidya vah he jo mukti pradaan kare
 It is clear from this that the ultimate development of such a personality is the aim of idealistic education in which a person can attain self-realization, truth, Shiva and beauty
 aatmanubhuti kaa bodh prakritik dein nahin he isliye vyakti ko satat abhyaas evam praytn dwaara ise praapt karne kii koshish kerani chaiye
 Idealists views have not only determined the objectives of education but have also determined the nature of the curriculum suitable for it
 kyonki shiksha ke uddeshyon kii prapti tabhi sambhav he jabaki paathyakram bhi usee ke anusaar ho
 Idealism is the elixir of a person's personality or the attainment of eternal ideals of self-realization and does not consider the cultural material world to be the ultimate truth, but he only accepts the realization of the truth, idealism in the same material world and with the help of the physical environment is the advice to achieve the extreme truth
 gives
 manushya kaa aadhyatmik vaataavaran adhik mahatvapurn hota he kintu prakritik vaataavaran kii upeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 Person is a combination of body and mind and mind is more important in this
 kintu adarshavaadi maanate hai ki yadi shaareerik aavashyaktaaon kii purti na kii gayi to maansik kriya bhi duhsadhay ho jaayegi
 a person can move towards self-realization only when his physical development has taken place
 atah bhautik jagat kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 According to the Greek philosopher Plato, the ultimate goal of education is the attainment of God
 atah paathyakram main unheen vishyon ko sammilit karne par bal dena chahie jiske madhyam se ukt lakshya ko praapt kiya ja sake
 To achieve this goal, it is necessary to first achieve the three elements Satya, Shiva and Sundar
 ye teenon aadhyatmik mulya manushya kii kramshah bauddhik, naitik evam kalatmak kriyaaon ke dwaara praapt hote hai
 Therefore, Plato emphasizes on the inclusion of the same subjects and activities in the curriculum that will give the human skill in the above mentioned actions
 unhone bauddhik kriyaaon ke liye bhashaa, sahitya, itihaas, bhugol, ganit tathaa shaareerik vigyaan ko mahatvapurn bataaya he
 Dharma, ethics, and theology for moral activities and various arts and music were included for artistic activities
 adarshavaadi vichaarak horn mahoday paathyakram ke nirdhaaran main thos aadhaaron ko adarsh samaaj ke antargat vyakti ke charitra main khojate hai
 Therefore, according to him all those experiences, actions and living conditions etc
 that lead us to the perfection of the ideal
 unheen ko paathyakram main mahatvapurn sthaan dena chaiye
 His idea is- duusare shabdon main unhone gyanoparjan evam jivicoparjan se sambandhit vishyon ko paathyakram main sammilit karne kii sifarish kii he
 German academician Harbart emphasizes character and moral development for the spiritual advancement of man and for that, language, literature, history, art and music are the main places in the curriculum
 unke anusaar paathyakram main bhugol, ganit tathaa vigyaan ko gaun sthaan dena chaiye
 Although TP Nun has strongly supported the individualistic objective of education, he is an advocate of idealistic ideology in relation to curriculum construction
 unka vichaar he ki vidhyalay kaa kartavya ek nishchit prakaar kii aupchaarik shiksha dena maatr nahin he apitu uskaa kartavya he ki vah apane samaaj evam raashtra kii aadhyatmik shakti kii unnati main sahyog pradaan karen
 Keep its historical order and cultures safe and make a successful effort to make its future bright
 atah vidhyalay main balak ko do pramukh kriyaaon ke liye prashikshit kiya jaan chahie-ek ve kriyaayen jo balak ke vaiyaktik evam saamaajik jivan kii unnati karen tathaa duusari ve kriyaayen jo maanviya sabhyataa ke praarambhik swaroop kaa nirdhaaran karen
 In a nutshell, it is said that according to the idealistic ideology, there should be no mobility in the curriculum of education, so that changes can be made to the needs of the children
 is drushti se adarshavaadi apane paathyakram main jahaan ek taraf shaareerik shiksha ko mahatv dete hai, vahiin duusari taraf prakritik vaataavaran kii jaankaree ke liye bhautikee, rasayaniki, bhumiti bhugol, khagol, bhugarbha vigyaan, vanaspatishaastra, jeev vigyaan ityadi vishyon ko bhi mahatv dete hai
 For the spiritual development of the child, subjects like art, literature, ethics, religion, philosophy, etc
 are considered more important by idealists
 praayah logon kaa aisa vichaar he ki adarshavaad shiksha ke lakshya evam uddeshyon kaa nirdhaaran karata he, shikshan paddati kaa nahin
 But the reality is that idealism does not disregard the education system, with more emphasis on the objectives and ideals of education
 adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke anusaar shikshan paddati aisi honi chaiye jisase balak ke vyaktitv kaa vikaas ho sake
 Any teaching method can be said to be good only if it can prove helpful in imparting knowledge to children keeping in view their intelligence, ability, interest, strength, strength and need
 adarshavaad ke anusaar yadi vyakti ek baar spasht rup se shiksha kaa uddeshy nishchit kar letaa he to phir yah gaun ho jaataa he ki vah kin paddatiyon ke sahare un uddeshyon ko praapt karegaa
 Therefore, when the method is suitable for the teacher or learner, then there is no harm in adopting it
 isiilie vah khel paddati ko apnaane main bhi sankoch nahin karata he
 Frobel regarded the teaching method as basically 'self-motivated action'
 khel dwaara shiksha bhi aatm kriya dwaara shiksha kaa hi ek bhed he
 Regarding sports, Froebel has written - 'sports is a mirror for the child under him and outside the world
 yah jivan evam lagan shakti ko abhivyakti karne vaali pravriti he
 ' adarshavaadi pracheen sahitya kaa aadar karte hai
 They believe that the knowledge discovered by the ancestors is full of our ancient literature, we should benefit from it
 pracheen sahitya ke adhyayan ke liye ve ‘swadhyay vidhi’ ke pakshdhar hai
 But this method can only be used at a higher level of education
 paashchaatya adarshavaadi vichaarkon ne anek shikshan-vidhiyon kaa vikaas kiya he
 Nowadays there is a special discussion of 'Q & A' method
 sucraat jaise adarshavaadi ne is vidhi kaa prayog isa se 450 varsh purv kiya tha
 Socrates' teaching was based on dialogue with appropriate questions
 sucraat ke shishy plato ne bhi sukaraati vidhi kaa hi anusaran kiya
 Plato developed the dialogue method based on the Q&A method
 plato ne apni adhikansh rachanaayen bhi samvaad ke rup main likhi hai
 Aristotle, a disciple of Plato, used to emphasize the 'arrival' and incorporation methods
 nigaman vidhi main ‘saamaanya se vishesh kii ore’ tathaa aagaman vidhi main ‘vishesh se saamaanya kii ore jate hai
 Among modern idealist philosophers, Hegel showed his interest in 'logic-method', pastology as 'practice-method' and René decarte moving from 'simple to complex'
 adarshavaadi ‘vyaakhyaan vidhi’ athwa adhyayan vidhi ko upekshaniya nahin samajhataa
 Real experience is superior, but it is impossible for human to get knowledge of all the things of the world through direct experience
 atah duusare ke anubhav se laabh uthaane main adarshavaadi koi haani nahin dekhtaa
 Therefore, there is no hesitation in adopting the lecture method anywhere
 vah samuhik charchaa kaa bhi aashray letaa he or mahatvapurn vishyon ko spasht karne ke liye vaad-vivaad vidhi kaa aashray lene kii salaah detaa he
 While the idealist proposes to teach infants through 'katha Vidhi', he advocates giving education to teenagers through 'play-method' and 'conversation-method'
 harbart ne naveen gyaan ko vidhyaarthiyon tak pahunchaane ke liye ‘panchapadi’ kaa aashray liya he
 According to the famous idealist pastology, the teaching method 44 should correspond to the development of the brain and he has called his method as 'anashang'
 pastalaji ne apni vidhi kaa saar sankhya, rup evam bhashaa bataaya he
 Naturalists consider the teacher to be negligible in teaching and advises them to remain behind the scenes
 adarshavaadi vichaarak thik iske vipareet kehete hai
 According to idealism, the teacher's position is paramount in the teaching process
 shikshan-prakriya yantrik nahin hoti
 In this, one personality has influence on another
 balak jo antatah vyakti he – na ki sharir, uskaa vikaas prabhaavshaalee vyaktitv dwaara hi sambhav he
 Therefore, the personality of the teacher should be influential
 janm ke samay balak main anek shaktiyaan sushupt hoti hai
 The teacher's task is to awaken these latent powers
 bhartiya adarshavaad main shikshak ko sarvottam sthaan dete hue unhen ‘tridev’ kii sangya dete hue kaha gaya he ki – ‘gururbrahma, gururvishnuh, gururdevo maheshwarah’ arthath guru hi brahma, vishnu tathaa maheshwar he
 Similarly, in the 'brahmacharya Sukta' of the Atharvaveda, it is said in relation to the Acharya that 'acharyas Mrityavarunah, Som Oshadhayyah - usually
 ’ arthath guru puraane sanskaron ko nasht karke naveen sanskaar daalata he or balak ko naveen jivan pradaan karata he, isliye vah mrityurvarun kaha gaya he
 The Guru washes away the mischiefs of the mind, hence he is called Varuna
 vah shaanti ke maarg par le jaataa he
 Therefore, he was given the name of medicine because of the similar to Som and to overcome from diseases like difficulty
 isliye adarshavaadi vichaarak balak ke aantarik athwa aadhyatmik vikaas ke liye shikshak kii aavashyaktaa par bal dete hai
 In education system, the teacher is the guide of the student's life
 vah unhen uchit maarg-darshan karke uski swaabhaavik shaktiyon ko uchit disha main viksit karne kaa avasar pradaan karata he
 Teacher is the axis of teaching
 uske bina shikshan-prakriya adhuri rahegi
 Ideals and goals and values of life are already in place
 plato ke anusaar inkaa pehle se hi astitv he
 It is the responsibility of the teacher to strive for the development of a child-oriented personality so that they can achieve their goals easily
 is prakaar adarshavaadi vichaarak balak ko prakritik praani se saamaajik evam aadhyatmik praani main parivartit karne ke liye shikshak kii aavashyaktaa par adhik bal dete hai
 The well-known idealist Frobel has described the need of teacher Hwpi Mali for the best development of a child-friendly plant in the garden garden
 ross ne adarshavaad ke anusaar ‘shikshaarthi’ ke samuchit vikaas ke liye ‘shikshak’ ke sthaan kaa nirupan karte hue likhaa he- It is because of the teacher's extreme importance that most scholars term idealistic education as 'teacher centered education'
 adarshavaad main anushaasan ko upyukt shiksha ke liye aavashyak samajha jaataa he
 Idealist thinkers are rigid biases in education
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar balak ko purna swatantraaa nahin deni chahie
 There are different views in this regard between idealism and naturalism
 prakrutivaadee shiksha-swatantraaa main adhik vishwaas rakhte hai
 Whereas in idealistic education- discipline
 is sambandh main thomas evam laing ne likhaa he-‘‘prakrutivaadiyon kaa naaraa’’ swatantraaa he
 Whereas the idealist slogan is discipline
 ’’ adarshavaadi vichaarak maanate hai ki balak ko purna swatantrata dene se to haani kii hi sambhaavna adhik he, laabh kii kam
 Therefore, limited freedom should be provided to the child
 adarshavaad anushaasan par bal avashya detaa he kintu vah damanaatmak anushaasan ke paksh main nahin he kyonki kathor niyantran main rakhkar or damankaaree sadhano dwaara sthapit anushaasan kaa parinaam praayah bhayankar hota he
 Therefore, the form of discipline is effective
 iske liye adarshavaad naitik gunon ke vikaas ko mahatv detaa he
 For the development of moral qualities, it is necessary to develop qualities like humility, honesty, punctuality, obedience, truthfulness etc
 which are possible only in a disciplinary environment
 adarshavaadi dharna main balak main anushaasan kii sthapana ‘aatm-prerit ruchi’ ke vikaas se hi sambhav he kyonki balak kii jisamen swayan kii ruchi hoti he, usee ko grahan karata he ruchi ek prakaar kii nishchayatmak pravriti hone ke kaaran vyakti ke bheetar se utpann hoti he
 Since discipline is based on interest
 atah isaki prerana bhi bheetar se milti he
 There is no place for frivolity, euphoria or indiscipline in the work which a person will do with self-confidence
 vahaan swaabhaavik rup se anushaasan sthapit ho jaayoga
 Another belief of idealism in relation to discipline is that it cannot be established by award or punishment
 balak koi acha kaary puraskaar ke lobh main aakar nahin karata
 The award for virtues should also not be arranged in the school
 satya bolne ke liye kisi praskaar kii zarurat nahin he
 This is human duty only
 ise to karnaa hi chaiye
 The child does some work because he has genuine interest in that work and he also gets real pleasure from it
 is prakaar balak main ‘aatmanushasan’ kii neenv padati he or kaalaantar main vah anushaasit rahata he
 According to the idealistic pastology, sympathy should be taken towards the child
 frobel ke anusaar balak ke upar niyantran uski ruchi ke gyaan ke aadhaar par tathaa sahanubhuti evam prem ke prakaashan dwaara karnaa chaiye, kyonki anushaasan kii prerana to bheetar se milti he
 In confirmation of this opinion, it seems reasonable to state that the discipline of 'honor' starts out externally but ends internally by self-control
 ’ An object, action or idea is evaluated on the basis of any pre-determined criteria
 ye mandand vyaktigat bhi ho sakate hai or saamaajik bhi, manovaigyanik bhi ho sakate hai or vaigyanik bhi, alpamaanya bhi ho sakate hai or bahumanya bhi
 The more objective the criterion is, the more individuals are accepted
 vah utana hi adhik acha mandand mana jaataa he
 Similar efforts have been made here and idealistic education has been evaluated on the basis of the present circumstances and aspirations and aspirations of the Indian society
 yadi uparyukt varnit shiksha ke vibhinn angon ke sambandh main adarshavaadiyon dwaara prastut vichaaron ke sandarbh main adarshavaad kaa moolyankan karen to hamen uske bahut se gun evam dosha kaa pataa chalata he
 Following are the effects, qualities or contributions of idealism in the context of education: adarshavaadiyon ne shiksha ke jin uddeshyon ko prastaavit kiya he, unase baalkon ke uttam charitra kaa nirmaan hota he
 He has considered a remarkable aim of education to develop the qualities of Satya, Shiva and Sundar among children, which are the pillars of good character
 shiksha ke uddeshyon kaa nirdhaaran karne main adarshavaad ne atyadhik mahatvapurn bhoomika prastut kii he
 According to idealistic thinkers, a child is born as a classical creature with some basic tendencies and education is the main tool to make him a cultured member of society
 atah ve shiksha ke uddeshyon par vistrut rup se vichaar karte hai
 Idealism gives the teacher a paramount place in education
 isse shiksha-jagat main shikshak ko gauravpurn sthaan praapt hota he saath hi balak or samaaj donon ke hit ke liye atyaavashyak he
 Idealism has given such principles of 'self-control' and 'self-control' which can be followed by solving the problem of increasing indiscipline and stress among students today
 adarshavaadi shiksha main vyakti or samaaj donon ke hit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vyaktigat evam saamaajik mulyon ko samaan mahatv diya gaya he
 Idealism has given importance to both the poles in the education process ie teacher and learner by respecting the personality of the child in his education plan
 adarshavaad se hi prabhavit hokar aaj sabhi log baalkon ke ‘adarsh vyaktitv’ par bal dete hai
 Idealistic education lays greater emphasis on the development of spiritual, religious and moral qualities
 adarshavaadi shiksha main uparyukt gunon ke hote hue katipay dosha bhi paye jate hai- The objectives of idealism that education has set are so 'abstract' and subtle that it is very difficult for a person of common intelligence to understand them
 ye amoort evam sookshm uddeshy vartmaan se sambandhit na hokar bhavishya se sambandhit hote hai
 This philosophy gives priority to the teacher and ideal rather than the child and its nature and thus modern ideas related to 'child centered education', 'child centered curriculum' and 'child centered teaching method' are ignored
 jo aaj ke yug ke liye bilkul nyaay sangat nahin he
 Idealism gives more importance to spiritual subjects in the curriculum and has not given much attention to topics related to practical life
 is prakaar kaa paathyakram bhale hi pracheen adarsh samaajon ke liye laabhprad siddh hota ho kintu aaj ke audyogic yug main is prakaar ke paathyakram kaa koi mahatv nahin he
 Idealism determined the objectives and goals of education but did not give a definite teaching method
 isamen jo vidhiyaan batalaai bhi gayi hai ve ratane par adhik bal detii hai
 These methods are unscientific
 uparyukt vivechan se yah spasht hua ki kis prakaar yah darshanik vichaardhaara ‘man’ ‘vichaar’ athwa ‘adarsh’ ko satya evam vaastavik maanati he or is bhautik sansar ko ek bhram athwa praturup maanati hai
 In the context of education, it can be said about idealism that despite being full of many qualities, it is not considered to be completely blameless in today's materialistic outlook, yet for the end of the struggle, discord and disharmony in today's materialistic era
 Ideological ideology has to be adopted again in different walks of life
