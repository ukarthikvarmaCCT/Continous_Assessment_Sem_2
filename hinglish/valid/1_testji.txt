 70 Homestead Drive, New Jersey 08068 United States 70 Homestead Drive, Pemberton, NJ 08068 Varruchi Katyayana is a famous commentator of Paninian sources
 vararuchi katyayan ke vaarthik panineey vyakaran ke liye ati mahatvashaalee siddh hue hai
 Without these talks Paninian grammar would have been incomplete
 vaartikon ke aadhaar par hi peeche se patanjali ne mahabhashya kii rachana kii
 Purushottamadeva has written these names of Katyayana in his Trikandesha Abhidhankosh - Katya, Punaravasu, Medhajitha and Varruchi
 "kaatya' naam gotrapratyaant he, mahabhashya main uskaa ullekh he
 The name Punavasu is related to the constellation, "punavasu" is synonymous with Varruchi in "linguistics"
 medhajit kaa kahin anyatra ullekh nahin miltaa
 In addition, a name of Katyayana Varruchi has also come from 'katruthar' in Kathasaritsagar and Brihatkathamanjari
 hemchandra evam medini koshon main bhi katyayan ke "vararuchi' naam kaa ullekh he
 There are some facts on Katyayan Varruchi's reading of the narrative - though in most places Katyayan has interpreted Paninian formulas by following, attempting to preserve the formulas by reasoning and criticizing, but has also changed the formulas elsewhere
 And sometimes, they have prohibited them by showing faults in Panini Sutras and where Katyayan has to give appendices
 sambhavat: isi vararuchi katyayan ne vedasarvanukramani or praatishakhya kii bhi rachana kii he
 Some of the Bharaja censorious verses made by Katyayana are also discussed in the Mahabhashya
 kaiyat or nagesh ke anusaar bhrajasanjyak shloke vaarthikkaar ke hi banaae hue hai
 Pratishyakhyam vaarthikkaar katyayan vararuchi or prakritprakashkar vararuchi do vyakti hai
 Prakrit light illuminator Varruchi was a contemporary of Harsha Vikramaditya of the sixth century, having been the maternal uncle of "vasavadatta" prophet, while the commentators of Panini Sutras had been there long before that
 ashok ke shilaalekh main vararuchi kaa ullekh he
 Though the tribe of Prakrit Prakriti Varruchi was also a Katyayan, on the basis of this, the writer and Prakrit Prakriti cannot be considered the same person, because the nature of Prakrit Varruchi in Ashoka's article seems clearly new
 falat: ashok ke purvavarti katyayan vararuchi vaarthikkaar hai or ashok ke parvarti vararuchi prakritprakashkar
 The "chaturbhani" published from Madras does not contain the term "amphitheater", as the narrator Varruchi has been famous for the name "tithitapriya" and the usage of the tantrits in the "amphitheater" is very small
 sambhavat: yah vararuchi koi anya vyakti he
 The Katyayana, which has been discussed by Huyentsang in his travelogue, the Palaiyavana, which took place almost 300 years after Buddha-nirvana, is also a different person from the narrator
 yah katyayan ek buddha acharya tha jisane "abhidharmagyanprasthaan" naamak baudhdhashastra kii rachana kii he
 There is also a head Jain Sthavaar named Katyayan
 aftect kii hastlikhit granthsuchee main vararuchi or katyayan ke banaae granthon kii charchaa kii gai he
 It is difficult to decide how many writers are Katyayan in these texts

 Apart from this, it has also served in CID
 ganga tat par basii kaashi badi puraani nagari he
 Not too many cities are as ancient as this one
 hajaaron varsh purv kuch nate kad ke saanwale logon ne is nagar kii neenv daali thi
 Then the business of clothes and silver started here
 kuch samay uparaant pashchim se aaye unche kad ke gore logon ne unki nagari chin lee
 They were great fighters, had no gates, nor real estate
 ve apane ko arya yani shreshth va mahaan kehete the
 The Aryans had their own castes and families
 ek rajgharaana kaashi main jamaa
 His Rajkula settled in Ayodhya near Kashi also
 use raja ikshvaku kaa kul kehete the, yani suryvansh
 The Chandra dynasty was established in Kashi
 saikadon varsh kaashi nagar par bharat rajkul ke chandravanshi raja raaj karte rahe
 Kashi was then one of the eastern cities of the Aryans, the frontier of their rule
 usase pare purv kaa desh apavitra mana jaataa tha
 Chandravanshee mahabharat purv magadh main raja jarasandh ne rajya kiya or kaashi bhi usee samrajya main samaa gai
 The Aryans had marriages of girls here by swayamvara
 ek swayamvar main pandav or kaurav ke pitamah bhishma ne kaashi naresh kii teen putriyon amba, ambika or ambalika kaa apharan kiya tha
 This kidnapping resulted in hostility between Kashi and Hastinapur
 mahabharat yuddh main jarasandh or uskaa putr sahadev donon kaam aaye
 Later the Gangetic floods submerged the Pandavas' capital, Hastinapur, then the Pandavas settled in Kaushambi on the banks of the Yamuna in the present Allahabad district
 unka rajya vatsa kahalaaya or kaashi par magadh kii jagah ab vatsa kaa adhikaar hua
 After this, a Rajkula named Brahmadatta took control of Kashi
 us kul main bade pandit shaasha hue or main gyaan or panditai brahmanon se kshatriyon ke paas pahunch gai thi
 His contemporary was King Ashwapati at Kaikeya Rajkul in Punjab
 tabhi ganga-yamuna ke doaab main raaj karne vaale paanchal main raja pravahan jabli ne bhi apane gyaan kaa danka bajaayaa tha
 It was during this period that Janakpur, Mithila became the ruler of the Videhas, in whose court Yajnavalkya, such as the learned Maharishi and the Pandita like Gargi, used to debate women
 inke samakaleen kaashi rajya kaa raja ajatshatru hua
 It was unique in the knowledge of the soul and the divine
 brahm or jivan ke sambandh par, janm or mrityu par, lok-paralok par tab desh main vichaar ho rahe the
 These ideas are called Upanishads
 isi se yah kaal bhi upanishad-kaal kehalaata he
 With the change of age, the sage Vardhaman Mahavira in Vaishali and Lichhavi of Mithila became Gautama Buddha in the Shakya of Kapilavastu
 unheen dinon kaashi kaa raja ashwasen hua
 He had Parshvanath here, who became the 23rd Tirthankara of Jainism
 un dinon bharat main chaar rajya prabal the jo ek-duusare ko jeetne ke liye, aapas main baraabar ladate rahete the
 These Rahyas were Magadha, Kosal, Vatsa and Ujjayini
 kabhi kaashi vatson ke haath main jaati, kabhi magadh ke or kabhi kosal ke
 After Parshvanath and shortly before the Buddha, Kansa, the king of kosala-sravasti, conquered Kashi and annexed it
 usee kul ke raja mahakoshal ne tab apni beti kosal devi kaa magadh ke raja bimbsar se vivaah kar dahej ke rup main kaashi kii vaarshik aamadani ek lakh mudra prativarsh dena aarambh kiya or is prakaar kaashi magadh ke niyantran main pahunch gai
 Due to Raj's greed, Ajatshatru, the son of King Bimbasar of Magadha, killed the father and took the throne
 tab vidhwaa bahan kosladevi ke dukh se duhkhi uske bhai kosal ke raja prasenjit ne kaashi kii aamadani ajatshatru ko dena band kar diya jiskaa parinaam magadh or kosal samar hui
 Kashi Kosal, sometimes Magadha got involved in this
 antatah ajatshatru kii jeet hui or kaashi uske badhate hue samrajya main samaa gai
 Later, the capital of Magadha moved from Rajgriha to Pataliputra and could never be attacked by Kashi again
 aadhunik kaashi rajya varanasi kaa bhoomihaar brahman rajya bana he
 After Indian independence, like all other princely states, the King of Kashi gave up all his administrative powers and started as a famous figure
 vartmaan sthiti main ye maatr ek sammaan oopaadhi rah gayi he
 The Ramnagar fort of Kashi Naresh is built on the banks of the Ganges River in the east of Varanasi city
 kaashi naresh kaa ek anya kila chet singh mahal, shivala ghat, varanasi main sthit he
 It was here that Maharaj Chet Singh, whose mother was Rajput, was killed by a British officer with more than 200 soldiers
 ramnagar kila or iskaa sangrahalay ab banaras ke raajaaon kaa ek smarak bana hua he
 Apart from this, it has remained the official residence of the King of Kashi from the 18th century
 aaj bhi kaashi naresh ko shahar main sammaan kii drushti se dekha jaataa he
 He has been the religious pioneer of the city and is considered an incarnation of Lord Shiva
 ye shahar ke dharmik sangrakshak bhi maane jate hai or sabhi dhamik kaaryakalapon main abhinn bhaag hote hai
 Dr
 Vibhuti Narayan Singh was the last king of pre-indian independence
 iske baad 15 oktober 1948 ko rajya bhartiya sangh main mil gaya
 After his death in 2000, his son Anant Narayan Singh is the King of Kashi and the bearer of this tradition

 aluminium shwet rang kii ek dhaatu he
 The Latin word alumen and the English word alum mean alum
 is fitkaree main se jo dhaatu pruthak kii ja saki, uskaa naam aluminium padaa
 Our introduction to alum is very old
 kankshi, tuvari or saurashtraj iske puraane naam he
 Alum is in fact a double compound of both potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate
 san 1754 main margraph ne yah pradarshit kiya ki jis mitti ko alumina kaha jaataa he, vah chooney se bhinn he
 Sir Humphrey Davy tried to separate the metal from alumia soil in 1807, but was not successful
 san 1825 main arsted ne aluminium chloride ko potacium sanras ke saath garam kiya or phir aswan karke paare ko uda diya
 There was a sparkle of metal in the powder that remained after doing this
 yahi dhaatu aluminium kahalaai
 In 1845, Frederick Wöhler used potassium metal as a reducing agent in the preparation of this metal
 use is dhaatu ke kuch chote-chote kan mili, jinaki pariksha karke usne bataaya ki yah nai dhaatu bahut halki he or iske taar khinche ja sakate hai
 Subsequently, in 1854, Devil prepared a good amount of this metal using sodium and sodium aluminum chloride
 us samay nai dhaatu hone ke kaaran aluminium kii ginati bahumoolya dhaatuon main kii jaati thi or iskaa upyog abharanon or alankaaron main hota tha
 In 1886, Charles Martin Hall in Ohio City isolated alumina mixtures in a smelled cryolite and an aluminum metal from it by electrification
 europe main bhi lagbhag isi varsh hero ne swatantra rup se isi prakaar yah dhaatu taiyaar kii
 The same hall-hero method is being used in the production of this metal nowadays

 vidyut cell ke bheetar galaa hua cryolite lete hai or vidyuddhara is prakaar niyantrit karte rahete hai ki uske pravaah kii garmi se hi cryolite baraabar galit avasthaa main bana rahe
 When the electrolyte is formed, the aluminum metal formed is heavier than the cryolite, hence settling down in the cell
 yah dhaatu hi runagra kaa kaam karti he
 The corroded metal is periodically flushed out of the cell
 cell main bich-bich main aavashyaktaanusaar or alumina milaate jate hai
 To reduce the melting point of cryolite, it is often added with a little calcium fluoride
 yah ullekhneey he ki aluminium dhaatu ke kaarkaane kii safalataa sasti bijli ke upar nirbhar he

 Prem and Sapna also fall in love during this time
 haalanki isse pehle ki prem apane parivaar ko bataa sake ki vah sapana se pyaar karata he
 She learns that her grandmother wants to marry Vicky's Sapna and Vicky has agreed to the offer
 prem apane bhai ke dil ko todna nahin chahta he
 Vicky has been sad for her ex-girlfriend for a very long time
 prem ab uske raste main nahin aana chahta he
 He tells Sapna that he was just fooling her
 dil tuutane ke baad sapana apni maami or mamaa ke dabaav main aati he or viki se shaadi karne ke liye sahamat hoti he
 However, Vicky gets to know the truth before marriage
 ant main sapana or prem phir se milte hai
 In the end it is shown that Vicky falls in love again when a new girl joins his office

 The story told by the twelfth effigy Padmavati is as follows - One day at night, King Vikramaditya sat on the roof of the palace
 mausam bahut suhana tha
 Poonam's moon was at its youth and everything looked so clear, as if it were day
 prakruti kii sundarata main raja ekadam khoe hue the
 Suddenly he was startled
 kisi sree kii cheekh thi
 Guess the direction of the scream
 lagaataar koi aurat cheekh rahi thi or sahaayta ke liye pukaar rahi thi
 In order to get rid of the misery of the woman, Vikram managed to get a shield and a sword and removed the horse from the stables
 ghode par savaar ho fouran us disha main chal pade
 Shortly afterwards they reached that place
 unhone dekha ki ek sree "bachaao bachaao" kahati hui betahasha bhaagi ja rahi he or ek vikaraal daanav use pakadaney ke liye uskaa peechha kar rahaa he
 Vikram did not miss a single moment and jumped from the horse
 yuvati unke charnon par girti hui bachaane kii vinati karne lagi
 Holding her arm, Vikram picked her up and tried to tie her up by addressing her sister
 unhone kaha ki vah raja vikramaditya kii sharnaagat he or unke rahete us par koi aanch nahin aa sakati
 While they were comforting him, the demon chanted
 usne vikram ko kaha ki un jaisaa ek saadhaaran maanav uskaa kuch nahin bigaad saktaa tathaa unhen vah kuch hi kshanon main pashu kii bhanti chid fadkar rakh degaa
 While speaking like this, he rushed towards Vikram
 vikram ne use chetavanee dete hue lalakaara
 The demon ridiculed his warning
 use lag rahaa tha ki vikram ko vah pal bhar main masal degaa
 He kept moving towards them
 vikram bhi puure saavdhaan the
 As he grew to capture Vikram, Vikram saved himself and attacked him with a sword
 rakshas bhi atyant furtila tha
 He changed the maneuver and saved himself and clashed
 donon main ghamaasan yuddh hone laga
 Vikram fought so swiftly and deftly that the demon was shattered by exhaustion and relaxed
 vikram ne avasar kaa puraa laabh uthaaya tathaa apni talwaar se rakshas kaa sar dhad se alag kar diya
 Vikram understood that the demon has ended, but the second moment his severed head again came in its place and the demon got up with double enthusiasm and started fighting
 iske alaava ek or samasya ho gai
 Where his blood had fallen, another demon was born
 raja vikramaditya kshan bhar ko to chakit hue, kintu vichlit hue bina ek saath donon rakshason kaa saamana karne lage
 Seeing the chance, a blood-born demon attacked him with a punch, he changed his maneuver and cut his arms in the first blow and his legs in the second blow
 rakshas asay pidaa se itnaa chillaaya ki puraa van gunj gaya
 Seeing him suffering from pain, the patience of the demon was answered and on getting the chance he ran away with his head
 chunki usne peeth dikhaai thi, isliye vikram ne use maarna uchit nahin samajha
 After the demon fled, Vikram came to the woman and saw that she was shivering in fear
 unhone usase kaha ki use nishcint ho janaa chahie or bhay tyaag dena chahie, kyonki daanav bhaag chukaa he
 They asked him to go to the palace with him so that he could take it to his parents
 us sree ne jawaab diya ki khatra abhi tala nahin he, kyonki rakshas mara nahin
 He will come back and find it and bring it back to this place
 jab vikram ne uskaa parichay jaananaa chaha, to vah boli ki vah singhul dweep kii rahanevaali he or ek brahman kii beti he
 One day she was taking a bath in the pond with her friends, then the demon saw her and was fascinated
 vahiin se vah use uthaakar yahan le aayaa or ab use apana pati maan lene ko kahata he
 He has thought that he will die, but will not let his holiness be destroyed
 vah bolte-bolte sisakane lagi or uskaa galaa rrundh gaya
 Vikram assured him that he would kill the demon and put an end to his problem and he asked the secret of the demon to be alive again
 us sree ne jawaab diya ki rakshas ke pet main ek mohini vaas karti he jo uske marate hi uske munh main amrit daal detii he
 She can resurrect him, but not the second demon born from her blood, so that second demon is crippled and dying
 yah sunakar vikram ne kaha ki ve pran karte hai ki us rakshas kaa vadh kiye bagaiyr apane mahal nahin lautenge chaahe kitni bhi pratiksha kyon na kerani pade
 When she asked him about Mohini, Sree expressed ignorance
 vikram ek ped kii chaaya main vishram karne lage
 Then a lion came out of the bushes and attacked Vikram
 chunki vikram puri tarah chaukanne nahin the, isliye singh unki baanh par ghaav lagaataa hua chalaa gaya
 Now Vikram also fully agreed to the attack
 duusari baar jab singh unki ore jhapata to unhone uske pairon ko pakadakar use puure jor se hawa main oochaal diya
 The lion fell too far and roared in anger
 duusare hi pal singh ne bhaagane vaale rakshas kaa rup dhar liya
 Now Vikram understood that he wanted to defeat them with deceit
 ve lapak kar rakshas se bhid gaye
 a fierce battle ensued in both
 jab rakshas kii saans ladate-ladate phoolne lagi, to vikram ne talwaar uske pet main ghused di
 The demon fell on the earth and started screaming with pain
 vikram ne uske baad talwaar se uskaa pet faad diya
 As soon as the stomach burst, Mohini jumped out and ran to bring nectar
 vikram ne betaalon kaa samaran kiya or unhen mohini ko pakadaney kaa aadesh diya
 The demon died in agony due to lack of amrit
 mohini ne apane bare main bataaya ki vah shiv kii ganika thi jise kisi galati kii sazaa ke rup main rakshas kii sevika bananaa padaa
 After returning to the palace, Vikram handed over the Brahmin girl to his parents and duly married Mohini himself

 Electrocardiography is the transversal interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart from outside the skin conductors for a fixed time
 yah ek vidyutahridlekhi upkaran dwaara utpann aprasarak recording he
 The word is derived from the Greek word electro, as it relates to electrical activity, cardio, which in Greek means heart, and graph, a Greek root word meaning "to write"

 During each heartbeat, there is a systematic gradual increase of the wave of depolarization in a healthy heart that is activated by the cells of the sinus-auricle, separated through the atrium, from the "endodermic conduction path"
 It passes through and then spreads throughout the ventricle

 , The right arm and the left leg form electrical conductive pairs: LA + RA, LA + LL, RA + LL) The output obtained from each pair is called a lead
 kaha jaataa he ki prayek lead hriday par vibhinn drushtikon se dekhte hai
 Different types of ecgs can be indicated by the number of leads recorded, for example 3-lead, 5-lead or 12-lead ECG
 a 12-lead ECG is one in which 12 different electrical signals are recorded at approximately the same time and will often be used as one-time recordings of the ECG, usually printed as a paper copy
 3- or 5-lead vaale isiji main nirantar nirikshan kiye jane evam ek upyukt anuvikshan upkaran ke screen par dekhe jane kii pravriti hoti he, udhaaharan ke liye ek shalya-chikitsa ke dauraan yaa ek ambulance main pahunchaae jane tak
 prayukt upkarnon ke aadhaar par 3- or 5-lead vaale isiji main koi sthaayee ricard -ho bhi saktaa he yaa nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 It is the best way to measure and diagnose abnormal rhythms of the heart, particularly abnormal rhythms caused by damage to the convection tissue that carries electrical signals, or abnormal rhythms generated by electrolytic imbalances
 In myocardial infarction, the ECG can identify damage to the heart muscle in specific areas, although it does not cover all areas of the heart
 isiji vishwasaneey rup se hriday ke pump karne kii kshamta kii maap nahin kar saktaa he, jiske liye paradhvani yaa ultrasound aadhaarit yaa anvik aushadhi pareekshanon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is possible to have a normal ECG signal during a heart rate stop
 kaha jaataa he ki 1872 main saint bartholomiu hospital main doctor of science kii oopaadhi praapt karne ke liye adhyayan karte samay marij ke hriday kii dhadkan kaa record praapt karne ke liye alexander muirhed ne jvergrast marij kii kalai main taar sanlagn kiya
 This activity was directly recorded by British physiologist John Burdon Sanderson using Lipman's micro-vessel electrometer

 This allowed real-time heartbeat to be recorded
 1911 main unhone ab bhi apane kaam ke liye bahut thodaa naidanik anuprayog dekha
 An early breakthrough came when William Enthoven, working in Leiden, the Netherlands, used the invention of the primitive electromagnet in 1903
 yah upkaran wallar dwaara prayog kiye gaye sookshm-vahika vidyutmapi evam 1897 main francisi ejeeniyar clement aidar dwaara swatantra rup se avishkaar kiye gaye rajjunuma vidyutdharamapi donon kii tulana main adhik samvedansheel tha
 
 Instead of using today's self-adhesive electric drivers, Einthoven's patients used to put their limbs in saline-filled characters from which the ECG was recorded

 For example, the device configuration has evolved from cumbersome laboratory equipment to a solid electronic system, often involving computerized interpretation of extrusion
 isiji recorder kaa output ek graph he jisamen samay ko x-aksh par evam voltata ko y-aksh par darshaya jaataa he
 a dedicated ECG machine will typically print on graph paper with a background pattern of 1 mm m वर्ग, with clear partitions on each 5 mm in both horizontal and vertical directions
 adhikansh isiji upkarnon ke output main parivartan laana sambhav he, lekin prayek milivolt ko y aksh par 1 semi ke rup main evam prayek second ko 25 mimi ke rup main x-aksh par darshana maanak hota he 
 kaagaj kii adhik tej gati kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he - udhaaharan ke liye - isiji main adhik sookshm vivaran nishchit karne ke liye
 By keeping the paper speed at 25 mm / sec, the ECG converts a small block of paper into a speed of 40 milliseconds
 paanch chote block milakar ek bade block banaate he, jo 200 milisecond main parivartit karata he
 Therefore, there are five large blocks per second
 ek anshankan sanket ko record ek saath shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 The standard signal of 1 millivolt can move the sluice vertically 1 cm forward, which are two large squares on ECG paper

 It is usually possible to change this orientation so it is necessary to check the labels to see which leads are represented
 aam taur par prayek kollam teen leedon ke liye samay main samaan kshan record karenge evam phir recording agle kollam main sthanantarit ho jayega jo us bindu ke baad hriday kii dhadakanon ko record karegaa

 It is also common to print one or two "rhythm bars" to aid analysis

 The term "lead" in electromagnetism causes a lot of confusion because it is used to indicate two different things
 aam bhashaa ke anusaar lead shabd kaa prayog vidyut chaalkon ko isiji recorder ke saath jodne vaale vidyut cabel ko suchit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 As such, it may be acceptable to mention the "left-handed lead" as the electric driver that should be connected near the left arm
 ek maanak "12-lead" vaale isiji main aam taur par das vidyut chaalak hote hai
 Alternatively, the term lead can indicate the difference of voltages between two electrical conductors and the detection of what is actually produced by the ECG recorder
 prayek kaa ek vishisht naam hoga
 For example, "lead I" is the voltage between the right-arm electrical conductor and the left-arm electrode, while "lead II" is the voltage between the right limb and the foot
 is prakaar ke lead "12-lead" vaale isiji kaa nirmaan karte hai
 To create additional confusion, the "limb lead" typically informs the accounting records obtained from leads I, II and III, rather than the electrical drivers attached to the limb
 chota avataran=== vidyut chaalkon kaa nirdhaaran ===12-lead vaale isiji ke liye das vidyut chaalkon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Usually the conductors consist of a conductor gel, which is embedded in the middle of a self-adhesive pad into which the cable is clipped

 They are labeled and placed in the patient's body in the following manner

 It consists of an rv4 lead which uses equivalent values of V4 on the right side of the chest wall and extends the chest lead through V7, V8 and V9 on the back
 5- or 12-lead vaale donon vinyas main, lead I, II evam III limb lead kehalaate hai
 The electrical conductors that produce these signals are located on the limb - one on each arm and one on the left leg
 Limb leads form dots known as Enthoven's triangles

 There are two types of lead: unipolar and bipolar
 Bipolar leads have one positive and one negative pole
 ek 12-lead vaale isiji main, limb lead dwidhruvi lead hote hai
 The unipolar lead also has two poles, such that the voltage is measured; However, the minus pole is a composite pole made up of the signals of many other electrical drivers
 12-lead vaale isiji main, limb lead ke atirikt sabhi ekadhruviya hote hai
 Wilson's central terminal VW RA; LA; And LL electric conductors are drawn together, through a network of common resistance capacitance, by connecting the electrical conductors so that the average voltage across the entire body is imposed, which is approximately the potential in infinity
 aavr, avl or avf lead sanvardhit lead hai
 They are taken from the same three electric drivers as leads I, II and III
 haalanki, ve hriday ko vibhinn konon se dekhte hai kyonki in leedon ke liye rinatmak vidyut chaalak wilson ke kendriya terminal kaa roopantaran he
 This debt neutralizes the power driver and allows the positive power drivers to become "investigative electric drivers"
 yah sambhav he kyonki eenthoven kaa niyam kahata he ki i + + III = 0
 sameekaran ko yah bhi likhaa ja saktaa i + III = II
 ise is prakaar likhaa jaataa he kyonki eenthoven ne eenthoven ke trikon main lead II kii dhruviyata ko purnataya badal diya, shaayad isliye ki ve sidhe kyuares samashtiyon ko dekhnaa chaahate the
 Wilson's central terminal paved the way for the development of augmented limb leads avr, avl, avf and the priestly leads V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6
 sanvardhit limb lead avr, avl, evam avf ko is prakaar se vistaarit kiya jaataa he kyonki rinatmak vidyut chaalak wilson kaa kendriya terminal rahane par sanket atyadhik chota hone ke kaaran upyogi nahin hota he
 Along with leads I, II, and III, augmented leads avr, avl, and avf form the basis of a six-axis reference system, which is used to calculate the electrical axis of the heart in the anterior plane
 avr, avl, evam avf lead ko i evam II limb lead kaa prayog kar bhi vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: Electric drivers are installed directly on the chest for the priestly leads
 hriday se unki sannikatataa ke kaaran, unamem sanvardhan kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 Wilson's central terminal is used for negative electric conductors and these leads are considered unipolar
 The priestly leads observe the electrical activity of the heart in the so-called horizontal plane
 kshaitij tal main hriday ke vaidyut aksh ko z aksh ke rup main suchit kiya jaataa he
 a typical ECG tracing of the cardiac cycle consists of a p wave, a QRS macro, a t wave, and a u wave normally seen in 50 to 75% ECG
 vidyutahridlekh kii aadhaar-rekha voltata ko samavidyutvibhav rekha kaha jaataa he
 Typically the isoelectric line is measured as part of the trajectory of the t wave and the tracing preceding the next p wave
 multah chaar vichlan the, lekin aarambhik amplifire dwaara shuru kiye gaye ganitiya sanshodhan ke baad, paanch vichalnon kaa khoj kiya gaya
 Enthoven chose the letters P, Q, R, s and t to identify tracing that were overlaid on unmodified labeled A, B, c and D
 isiji kii vyakhya is vichaar par nirbhar karti he ki alag-alag lead hriday ko alag-alag "drushtikonon" se dekhte hai
 This has two benefits
 sabase pehle, samasya darshane vaale lead kaa prayog yah anumaan lagane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki hriday kaa koun sa pradesh prabhavit he
 Secondly, the overall direction of travel of the wave of depolarization can also be estimated which may reveal other problems
 ise hriday sambandhi aksh kaha jaataa he
 The determination of the cardiac axis depends on the concept of a vector that describes the speed of the depolarization wave
 tab is sadish kaa iske ghatakon ke rup main vichaar kiye gaye lead kii disha ke sambandh main varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 One component will be in the direction of lead and it will be revealed in the behavior of QRS macro and one component will be at 90 degree from it
 The positive net deflection of the QRS macro suggests that the polarization wave is propagating through the heart in the direction that some components are in the direction of the lead itself
 hriday kaa vidyutiya aksh lalaat tal main hriday ke vidhruvikaran tarangagra kii saamaanya disha ko suchit karata he
 Through a healthy circulatory system, the cardiac axis is related to the part where the major muscle mass of the heart is located
 aam taur par yah daanye nilay kii kuch bhoomika ke saath baanyaa nilay hota he
 It is usually oriented in the right shoulder in the direction of the left foot, corresponding to the left lower quadrant of the six-axial reference system, although −30 ° to + 90 ° is considered normal
 yadi baanyaa nilay apni gatividhi yaa vishaal aakaar main vruddhi karata he to ise "baanye aksh kaa vichlan" kaha jaataa he kyonki aksh baanyein ore shighrata ke saath -30° se adhik mud jaataa he, vaikalpik rup se un sthitiyon main jahaan daanyaa nilay tanaavpurnya vibruddhigrast hota he tab aksh +90° se adhik mud jaataa he evam kaha jaataa he ki "daanyaa aksh vikshepan" maujuud hai
 Disorders of the heart's conduction system can disrupt the electrical axis without showing significant changes in the large size of the muscle
 daayen bundle shakha avrodh vaale samaayojan main, daanye yaa baanye aksh kaa vichlan dwipulika sambandhi avrodh suchit kar saktaa he
 There are a total of twelve leads, each of which records the electrical activity of the heart from various perspectives, interrelating various anatomic regions of the heart with the aim of identifying severe cardiovascular anemia or injury
 kaha jaataa he ki do lead jo hriday ke nikatavarti shaareerik kshetron ko dekhte hai ve sate hue hote hai isaki praasangikta is baat kaa nirdhaaran karne main he ki kya isiji main asaamanyata sahi rog yaa mithyaa nishkarsh darsha sakate hai
