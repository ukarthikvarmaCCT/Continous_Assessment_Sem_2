 In the Rigveda, the abode of the Aryans is designated as "saptasindhu" region
 rugveda ke nadisukt main aryanivas main pravaahit honevaali nadiyon kaa ekatra varnan he jisamen mukhya ye hai - kubha, crugu, gomti, sindhu, parushni, shutudri, vitasta, saraswati, yamuna tathaa ganga
 This description can be considered as the director of the boundary of the abode of Vedic Aryans
 brahman granthon main kuru paanchal desh arya samskruti kaa centre mana gaya he jahaan anek yajyayagon ke vidhaan se yah bhubhag "prajapati kii naabhi" kaha jaataa tha
 The Shatapatha Brahmin says that the language of Kuru Panchal is the best and authentic
 upanishdkaal main aryasabhyataa kii pragati kaashi tathaa videh janapadon tak faili
 As a result, the vast tract of land from Punjab to Mithila was considered to be the holy abode of the Aryans in the Upanishads
 dharmasutron main aryaavart kii seemaa ne vishay main bada matbhed he
 This famous range of Aryavarta has been set in the Vashisthadharmasutra that it is east of Adarsh, west of Kalk forest, Pariyatra and north of Vindhya and south of Himalayas
 anya do maton kaa bhi yahaan ullekh he ki aryaavart ganga or yamuna ke bich kaa bhubhag he or usamen krishna mrug nirbaadh sancharan karata he
 Boudhayan, Patanjali and Manu have also accepted the Vashisthakta opinion as authentic
 manu kii drushti main aryaavart madhyadesh se bilkul miltaa he or uske bheetar "brahmavart" naamak ek chota, parantu pavithratam bhubhag he, jo saraswati or drushadwati nadiyon dwaara simit he or yahaan kaa paramparaagat aachaar sadachaar mana jaataa he
 Aryavarta had this authentic boundary and the countries outside it were considered to be the country of Mlechcha, where it was necessary to perform Ishthi or rites in addition to pilgrimage
 boudhayandharmasutra main avanti, ang, magadh, suraashtra, dakshinapath, upaavri, sindhu-sauveer aadi desh mlechh deshon main ginaae gaye hai
 But the culture and civilization of the Aryans spread to other countries due to the religious zeal of the Brahmins, who do not believe the part of Aryavarta would be an act of truth
 medhatithi kaa is vishay main mat bada hi yuktipurna prathit hota he
 He says that "" The country in which the virtuous Kshatriya king conquers the Mlechchas and honors the Chaturvarnya and arranges the Mlchchas like the Chandalas of Aryavarta, that country is also a suitable place for Yajna, because the earth is not automatically polluted, but unholy Is corrupted only by the connection of ""
 aise vijit mlecchon deshon ko bhi medhatithi aryaavart ke antargat maanane ke pakshpaati hai
 This demand for progress of culture cannot be turned down

 These new Russians forced the local Sami and Pomor people to work hard under them
 16veen sadi tak roosi tsar-rajya or denmark-norge rajshahi ke bich cola prayadweep ko lekar kheenchaatani shuru ho gai, jis vajah se roosiyon ne yahan apni upasthiti or bhi majboot kari
 The Komi people and Nenets from the east also started settling here because epidemics started spreading in their reindeer herds in their motherlands
 roosi, komi or nenets ke dabaav se sami log uttar jane lage
 In 1916, the city of 'romanov-na-moorman' was established, which later came to be known as Murmansk

 Ludwig Wittgenstein was the philosopher of Austria
 unhone tarkshastra, ganit kaa darshan, man kaa darshan, evam bhashaa ke darshan par mukhyatah kaary kiya
 He is counted among the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century
 unke jite ji ek hi pustak prakashit ho pai - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 Philosophical Investigations became quite popular in later published books
 vitgenshtin cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke professor rahe hai
 Wittgenstein's father Karl was a Jew who later adopted the Protestant religion
 vitganstin kaa sabase bada yogadan bhashaa ko darshanik paripekshya main rakhane kaa he
 When anyone mentions philosophy in linguistics today, Wittgenstein's name is automatically remembered
 vitganstin ke lekhan se kaaphi tark-vitark upja he, yahan tak ki kai baar vitganstin ke kaam ko darshanavipareet bhi kaha gaya he, kintu aisa kahana isaliye galat hoga ki vitganstin se pehle bhi tarkshastriyon ne bhashaa ke taarkik vishleshan par jor daalaa tha
 Wittgenstein's Guru Bertrand is contributing heavily to give logic a proper place in philosophy
 vitganstin kaa darshanik jivan kaaphi dilachasp he kyonki unhone apane baad ke kaaryon main apane puraane kaaryon kaa khandan kiya he
 In his earlier books, Wittgenstein appears to state the importance of language for truth, but in his last book, "philosophical Investigations", Wittgenstein describes the prevalence of language in bias
 vitganstin kaa ye nishkarsh darshanik jagat ke liye nutan or mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In a way, Wittgenstein conceived the idea that language does not describe truth but construct truth
 samast paashchaatya darshan bhashaa main hi nihit he, kintu bhashaa hamen satya kaa ek rup hi pradarshit karti he, vah satya jo ham apni manyata yaa anubhav se nirmit karte hai
 Wittgenstein repeatedly mentions a language play, in which participants create and use language to express the truth
 is krida ke madhyam se vitgenstin bhashaa se vivirat tathyon va satya main antar bataate hai
 In his negative book "philosophical Investigations" he states that "most of the times when we talk about the" meaning "of a word, we only talk about the use of that word in one language"

 'apil' shabd mulat: angreji kaa he jisamen yadhyapi uske kai arth hai tathaapi hindi main uskaa prayog 'aavedanpatr' ke aashay main hota he jo kisi hetu yaa vaad ko neeche ke nyaayadhish yaa nyaayaadhikaran se hataakar ucchtar nyaayadhish yaa nyaayaadhikaran ke samaksh, neeche ke nyaayadhish yaa nyaayaadhikaran nirnay par punarvichaar ke liye, prastut kiya jaataa he
 There are four different systems for removing from a judge or tribunal for or under a suit or presenting it to a higher judge or judge
 apil dwaara, Through revision, lekh dwaara, tathaa By action of instruction
 punarawalokan kii karrwai dwaara kisi nyaayadhish yaa nyaayaadhikaran ke nirnay kaa punarvichaar usee nyaayadhish yaa nyaayadhish dwaara bhi ho saktaa he
 The difference between appeals and revisions is that revision always relies on the discretion of the High Court and cannot be sought as a right or title
 ucchtar nyaayalay punarikshan isi aadhaar par viyukt kar saktaa he ki neeche ke nyaayalay dwaara saar rup main nyaay ho chukaa he chaahe vah nirnay vidhi ke pratikul hi hua ho
 However, the appeal cannot be set aside on such grounds because once the appeal is accepted, the decision is required to be made in accordance with the law unless there is a contrary provision in the statute giving the right to appeal
 apil bharat kii lekhapranali se anek roopon main bhinn he
 The action of the article can only be in the High Courts and the Supreme Court, while the appeal can be in the High Courts and Courts or Tribunals other than the Supreme Court
 lekh ucch nyaayalay kii adheekaran shakti ke antargat is hetu nikaala jaataa he ki neeche ke nyaayalay, nyaayaadhikaran, shashan yaa uske adhikarigan apane kshetradhikaar ke baahar kaam na karen yaa saarvajanik prayojan ke liye die hue kshetradhikaar kaa prayog karnaa asweekaar na karen, athwa unke nirnay pratyaksh rup se desh kii vidhi ke pratikul na hone paaven tathaa ve apana kartavyapaalan uchit reeti se karen
 The appeal is thus not limited
 apil sabhi prashnon ko lekar ho sakati he---prashn chaahe tathy kaa ho chaahe vidhi kaa
 The second appeal is limited to questions of law only
 apil or nirdesh main yah bhed he ki nirdesh kii yachana neeche ke nyaayalay dwaara ucchtar nyaayalay se kii jaati he taaki vidhi yaa pratha ke kisi aise prashn kaa, jiske sambandh main neeche ke nyaayalay ko yuktiyukt andeh ho, ucchtar nyaayalay dwaara nirnay kara liya jaae
 There was no provision for appeal in English common law
 parantu saamaanya vidhi nyaayalayon kii galtiyaan trutilekh ke madhyam se kings bench nyaayalay dwaara sudhari ja sakati thim
 The error record was only on the question of method, not on the question of fact
 parantu roman vidhi main apil ke liye upbandh tha
 In England, the appeal proceedings were taken from Roman law and its incorporation into English law into promises that were decided by the Lord Chancellor under Suniti jurisdiction or by the Courts of Religion or Marriage
 baad main, samavidhi ne apil ke adhikaar ko, saamaanya vidhi tathaa anya kshetradhikaar ke antargat honevaale donon prakaar ke vaadon main, niyamit rup diya
 In ancient India, when disputes were few, the king himself settled the disputes of subjects
 us samay apil kaa prashn nahin tha kyonki raja nyaay kaa strot tha
 But there were popular courts along with Raja's court, later Raja himself established the lower courts
 lokapriy nyaayalay yaa neeche ke nirnay ke viruddh apil raja ke samaksh ho sakati thi
 In the Mughal period, pragmatism appealed to the Sadar civil court and the punist to the nizam-e-adalat

 Later High Courts were established in various provinces of India
 apil saamanyat: do prakaar kii hoti he---pratham apil yaa dwitiya
 Certain promises may also have a third appeal
 pratham apil aarambhik nyaayalay ke nirnaay ke sambandh main ucchtar nyaayalay main hoti he
 Second Appeal - Appeals before the superior officer in relation to the decision of the Court of Appeal
 vyavhaar vaadon main nyaayalay ke samast aadesh do bhaagon main vibhajit hote hai--'ajyapti' tathaa aadesh'

 It is proved by the use of joules that if any body is enclosed by a stable wall, we always have to do a certain amount of work to get that body from a certain initial state to a certain final state
 kaary kii maatra pind kii praarambhik tathaa antim avasthaaon par hi nirbhar rahati he, is baat par nahin ki yah kaary kaise kiya jaataa he
 If the values of pressure and volume in the initial state are p0 and V0, then the volume of the work depends on the pressure and volume of the final state, that is, the volume of the work is a function of p and v
 yadi kaary kii maatra kaa w hai to ham likh sakate hai ki w = u - U0 yah sameekaran ek raashi u kii paribhaasha he jo keval us pind kii avasthaa par hi nirbhar rahati he na ki is baat par ki vah pind us avasthaa main kis prakaar pahunchaa he
 We call this sign the internal energy of the body
 yadi koi pind ek nishchit avasthaa se prarambh karke vibhinn avasthaaon main hote hue phir usee praarambhik avasthaa main aa jaae to uski antarik urja main koi antar nahin hoga, arthath f du = 0 or ek yatharth avakal he
 If a body moves from one state to another, its value will not always be equal to zero
 yadi prayek avasthaa ke liye u kaa maan gyaat kar liya gaya he to yah antar gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 If any part of the body of the body is thermodynamic, then the body will always have to give heat equal to this difference
 yadi ushma kii maatra q he to q = u - U0 - w is sameekaran main q unheen ekakon main napa jayega jisamen W, parantu yadi hamane q kaa ekak pehle hi nishchit kar liya he to ham is sameekaran dwaara in donon ekakon kaa anupaat gyaat kar sakate hai
 Thus by using Joule we can find the mechanical equivalent of heat
 is prayog main q shunya ke baraabar hota he or kaa maan ushma ke ekakon main gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The equation is a mathematical form of the first principle of thermodynamics
 isamen w vah kaary he jo baahar se us pind par kiya jaataa he
 If this body works by itself, the result of which is dw and the amount of internal energy of the body increased in a process is du, then the heat counted will be given to that body then dq and dq = du + dw And before proceeding further we will describe a process that is used a lot in thermodynamics
 ise praaia: sthitik ke aaytan ko ek atyanu pariman dv se parivartit karen to iskaa taap bhi thodaa parivartit ho jayega
 Once the equilibrium is attained, suppose in its volume we change a little more
 is tarah ham dhire dhire avasthaa 1 se avasthaa 2 main pahunch jaayange
 If the magnitude of our changes gradually increases towards zero, then in the end the changes from 1 to 2 are called
 aise prakram kaa yah bhi lakshan he ki visthapanon, kiye gaye kaary evam avashoshit ushma ke chihnon ko ulatakar is nikaay ko avasthaa 2 se kaaran in prakramon ko utkramntic prakram kehete hai
 Processes that are not reversible are called non-reversible processes
 yah saralata se siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki yadi kisi nikaay kii daab p ho to ek utkramntic prakram main yah jo kaary karegaa vah pdv ke baraabar hoga
 Therefore, we can also write the first principle of thermodynamics like this: dq = du + pdv The Rd is a village in Anantapur district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India

 Bhadralok is Bengali for the new category of 'gentlemen' that arose during the British colonial period
 adhikansh, haalanki sabhi nahin, bhadralok varg ke sadsy upree jati, mukhya rup se baidh, brahman, kysth, or baad main mahishas hai
 There is no exact translation of Bhadralok in English, as it attributes economic and class privileges over caste uplift
 unnisvin shatabdi main kai bhadralok visheshadhikaar praapt brahman yaa pujari jati yaa madhyam str ke vyapaaree varg se aae the
 Anyone who could show considerable wealth and standing in the society was a member of the Bhadralok community
 bhadralok samudaay main bengali samaaj ke samrudh or madhyam varg ke virgon se sambandhit sabhi sajjan shaamil hai
 In the upper middle classes, a zamindar, or landowner, usually bears the title of Chaudhary or Roy Chaudhary at the end of the name, and Babu would initially be considered a Bhadralok
 raja yaa maharaja sheershak vaale ek zameendaar ko madhyam varg se adhik mana jayega, lekin phir bhi ek bhadralok 'sajjan' hoga
 All members of the professional classes, i
e
 those related to newly emerging occupations such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, university professors and higher civil servants, were members of the Bhadralok community
 haalanki, naam ke ant main esquaire sheershak vaala ek vyakti, nite ke thik neeche ek rank ko darshata he, jise bhi bhadralok se adhik mana jaataa tha
 The two biggest factors for the rise of Bhadralok were England East India Company's trade in the Ganges Valley, and Western-style education
 kalakatta main achal sampatti kii keemton main baari vruddhi ne kshetra main kuch chote makaan maalikon ko ratorat amir banane kaa netritv kiya
 The first identifiable Bhadralok figure is undoubtedly Ram Mohan Roy, who bridged the gap between the Persianized nobility of the Sultanate era in Bengal and the new, Western-educated, Nouveau-rich consolidated class
 bengal punarjagran bade paimaane par kiya gaya tha or bhadralok ne bhaag liya tha
 Apart from this, the rise of Brahmo Samaj and various other societies was also a widespread Bhadralok phenomenon
 bhadralok hone ke liye kuch pashchimi or uttari europea mulyon ko gale lagaaya janaa tha, shiksha kaa ek maamla he, or aupniveshik se pakshpaat yaa rojgaar ke liye paatrata sarkaar
 While the Bhadralok were influenced by the West they were also those who reacted most strongly against the West, and the most shocking criticisms as well as the most enthusiastically defended Bhadralok writers of Westernization
 babu shabd kaa arth rank or garima kaa ek vyakti he
 It is commonly used to refer to the gentleman, but is intended for anyone who enjoys a position of dominance in their immediate social circle

 Among the landlords there was a general and extremely wealthy zamindar in the same rank as a Babu, Thakur or Mirza in the East Bengal Presidency, particularly in Bengal and Behar, and would rank just below the king

 In the colonial period the term was referred to in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to members of the indigenous community, especially law courts and revenue establishments, where the majority of members were appointed as munsifs from respectable and / or zamindar families

 The Prime Minister of Pakistan is elected in the lower house while the President is selected by the Electoral College
 prantiy or rashtriya sadanon ke alaava pakistan main paanch hajaar se adhik chaynit nagar nigam sarkarein bhi kaam kar rahi hai
 There are many political parties in Pakistan
 aamtaur par koi bhi ek party bahumat hasil nahin karti or aam chunaav ke baad sattarudh gathbandhan kaa gathan jaruri he
 The Constitution of Pakistan, however, does not spell out the electoral process in full detail, but it defines a broad basic structure of elections, the basic principles and procedures, and also gives the period between successive elections
 nirvachan prakriya sambandhit mukhya mulya, jiske aadhir par chunaav yojit kiye jate hai, kaa praaroop pakistani samvidhan ke anuchhed 222-226 ke paath 2 main diye gaye hai: The Election Commission of Pakistan was established by the Constitution of Pakistan

 Template: Infobox Election matdaan kii umr In linguistics, the study of sign processes, or expression and communication, signs and symbols is called signology
 ise aam taur par nimnlikhit teen shakhaon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he: Semiotics is often seen with important anthropological dimensions; For example, Umberto Eco proposes that every cultural phenomenon can be studied as communication
 tathaapi, kuch lakshanshasthri vigyaan ke taarkik ayaamon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 They also investigate fields related to natural science — such as how organisms can predict and adapt to their symbolic karma status in the world
 In general, semiotic theories take signs or signaling systems as their objective of study: the communication of information in living beings is covered in biosemiotics or zoologics
 vaakya-vigyaan lakshaniki kii shakha he, jo sanketon or pratikon kii aupchaarik visheshtaon ke saath sambandh rakhti he
 Actually, syntax "deals with the rules that govern how words are combined to form phrases and sentences
" Charles Morris states that semantics is concerned with the relation of signs to their instructions and the relationships they can or do represent with objects; And utilitarianism deals with the biotic aspects of semiotics, that is, all psychological, biological or social phenomena that occur in the action of signs
 shabd, jise angrezi main semeiotics likhaa jaataa he, pehali baar henry stabs dwaara sanketon ke pratipaadan se sambandhit chikitsa vigyaan kii shakha ko nirupit karne ke sunishchit arth main prayukt hua tha
 John Locke used the words semeiotike and semeiotics in book 4, chapter 21 of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding
 isamen ve bataate hai ki kaise vigyaan ko teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: Locke then elaborates on this third category of nature, naming it Σημειωτικη and explaining it as the "principle of signs" in the following words: unnisvin sadi main, charles sanders piers ne paribhaashit kiya, jise unhone "semiotic" kaha jo "sanketon kaa ardh-aavashyak, yaa aupchaarik siddhant he", jiskaa saar he "


 dwaara prayukt sabhi sanketon ke varna kya hone chahie, jise buddhi anubhav dwaara seekhney main sakasham hai" or jo sanket or sanket prakriya ke anusaar darshanik tark kaa anusaran karata he
 Charles Morris followed Pierce in using the term "semiotic" and expanded it from human communication to animal learning and use of signs
 tathaapi ferdinand de loshuar ne lakshan-vigyaan ke andar atyadhik mahatvapurn kshetra par gaur karte hue use saamaajik vigyaan se sambandhit paaya: Symptoms classify signals and signaling systems according to their mode of communication
 This process of meaningfulness relies on the use of codes used by humans to form words that may be individual vowels or letters, bodily actions to denote by their organisms or emotions, or commonly worn clothing
 kisi vastu ke sandarbh ke liye shabd gadhane hetu, samudaay dwaara apni bhashaa main ek saamaanya arth ko sweekrut karnaa hoga
 lekin vah shabd keval bhashaa kii vyakaranik sanrachana or kuta ke antargat arth ko sanchaarit kar sakegaa 
 kuta samskruti ke mulyon kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karte hai or jivan ke har pahalu ko arth ke nae rang jodne main sakasham hai
 To clarify the relationship between symptomatology and communication studies, communication is defined as the process of transferring data from source to recipient
 isliye, sampreshan ke vichaarak kuta, madhyam or sandarbh ke aadhaar par aaveshtit jaiviki, manovigyaan or yantriki ko spasht karne ke liye modelon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Both subjects also believe that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the recipient has to decode the data, ie being able to interpret the data by identifying it as the main one
 iskaa matlab he ki lakshanikta or sampreshan ke bich anivarytah paraspar vyapan he
 In fact, many concepts are shared, although the emphasis is different in each area
 messejas and minings: en introdection tu semiotics, marcel danesi sujhata he ki lakshanshastriyon kii praathamiktaayen, mahatv kaa adhyayan pehle or sampreshan baad main rahi hai
 Extremist vision was introduced by jean-jacques Nataíz, who considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to the application of semiotics as a musicologist
 lakshanikta bhashaa-vigyaan se is arth main alag he ki vah sanket kii paribhaasha ko samanyikrut karata he taaki sanketon ko kisi bhi madhyam main yaa samvedi reeti main sammilit kiya ja sake
 is prakaar yah sanket pranaaliyon or sanket sambandhon kii vyapaktaa ko badhaata he or bhashaa kii paribhaasha ko uskaa sarvaadhik vistrut alankaarik yaa lakshanik arth pradaan karata he
 Pierce's definition for the term "semiotic" as a study of the essential characteristics of signs, includes the effect of distinguishing it from linguistics as a study of contingent features acquired by the world's languages in the course of human development
 sambhawatah lakshan-vigyaan or bhashaa ke darshan ke bich bhed karnaa adhik kathin he
 In a sense, it is actually more of a difference between traditions than a difference of subjects
 vibhinn lekhakon ne khud ko "bhashaa kaa darshanik" yaa "lakshanshasthri" naam diya he
 This difference does not correspond to the separation of analytical and continental philosophy
 nazadik se dekhne par, vishyon ke sambandh main kuch matbhed paaya ja saktaa he
 Philosophy of language tends to pay more attention to natural languages or languages in general, while semiotics is more concerned with non-linguistic significance
 bhashaa ke darshan kaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke saath bhi ek majboot rishta he, jabaki sanketikta katipay manviki or saanskrithik nrivigyaan ke nikat he
 Semiosis or semeiosis is a process that derives meaning from any organism's apprehension about the world through signs
 sanketon kaa mahatv or sarthakata ko darshan or manovigyaan ke samast itihaas main manyata mili he
 Both Plato and Aristotle explore the relationship between signs and the relationship of the world, and Augustine considers the nature of the sign within the traditional system
 in siddhanton kaa pashchimi darshan par sthai prabhaav padaa, visheshkar shaikshik darshan ke madhyam se
 haal hi main, ambarto iko ne apane semiotics and filosphi of language main tark diya he ki lakshanik siddhant adhikansh, sambhawatah sabhi pramukh vichaarkon ke kaaryon main nihit he
 Early thinkers in this field include Charles W
 Morris Max Black considers Bertrand Russell's work preliminary
 lakshanikta ke anuprayogon main shaamil hai: Semiotics is only slowly establishing itself as an honorable subject
 kuch deshon main, uski bhoomika keval saahitiyik aalochana or drishy or shravy madhyamon tak hi simit he, lekin yah sankeern sankendran saamaajik or raajnneetik balon ke vyapak saamaanya adhyayan tak vistrut ho saktaa he ki kaise aadhunik samskruti ke antargat sakriy sthiti ko aakaar diya ja saktaa he
 In the current era of mass communication, issues of technology determinism assume new importance in the selection of media and the design of communication strategies
 arth ke vibhinn str or kabhi-kabhi chhipe prayojanon ko prakat karne ke liye lakshanik tareekon ke upyog ne kuch ko marxvaadi, nashwadi aadi ke rup main vishay ke tatwon ko naarkeey rup dene ko uksaaya he 
 Research has been published in dedicated journals such as Sign System Studies, founded by Juri Lotman and published by Tartu University Press; Semiotica, founded by Thomas A
 Sebeok and published by Mouton de Gruyter; Zeitschrift fur Semiotic; European Journal of Semiotics; Versus and others; Accepted articles in magazines of the American Journal of Semiotics and other subjects, especially magazines oriented towards philosophy and cultural criticism
 lakshanikta ne kai up-kshetron ko utpann kiye hai, jinamein nimnlikhit shaamil hai, par ye itane tak hi simit nahin he: Pictorial semiotics is intimately associated with art history and theory
 tathaapi, yah donon se kam se kam ek moulik tareeke se aage bad gai he
 While the history of art has limited its visual analysis to the small number of paintings that qualify as "artistic creations", pictorial semiotics has generally focused on the characterization of the paintings
 kala ke is paaramparik itihaas or siddhant se-or saath hi, lakshanik vishleshan kii anya pramukh dhaaraon se hatakar-sachitr lakshanikta ke liye vistrut vividhta kii sambhaavnaaon ko mauqaa miltaa he
 Some influences have been derived from event-action analysis, cognitive psychology, structural and cognitive linguistics and visual anthropology / sociology
 lakshanik siddhant ko varnit karne ke liye aahaar ek manapsand paaramparik vishay rahaa he, kyonki vah atyant sulabh he or ausat vyakti ke jivan se aasaani se joda ja saktaa he
 Semiotics is the study of signaling processes when it operates individually or in groups and how these signaling processes provide insight into circulating and understanding meaning
 aahaar ko isliye lakshanik kaha he kyonki taiyaar ho jane par uskaa arth badal jaataa he
 The comparison of the diet eaten by a wild animal to that of a corpse to represent a cultural dish clearly changes meaning when compared to a diet prepared by humans in the kitchen
 khaadya padaarth ko kuch saamaajik sanket-paddatiyon kaa pratik bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 "if food is treated as a gesture, the message it encodes will be found in the pattern of expressive social relationships
 The different hierarchies of message hierarchy, inclusion and exclusion, boundaries and boundaries transcend -day is about "
 aahaar is baat kaa lihaaj kiye bina hi lakshanik he ki use kaise taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Whether food is prepared with full precision in a good dining restaurant, or picked up from a pile of garbage, broken, swallowed, or eaten by a wild animal can still always be interpreted on this basis How a particular diet was prepared and in what context it was served
 vartmaan anusandhan ne paaya ki, jaise-jaise shakhaaen viksit hoti hai or adhik antarrashtriya ho jaati hai, unke pratik-chihn adhik pratikatmak or kam pratishthit ho jate hai
 The prestige and symbolism of a sign depends on cultural conventions and are related to each other on that basis
 yadi saanskrithik pratha kaa sanket par atyadhik prabhaav he, to sanket adhik pratikatmak mulya hasil karte hai

 Sixty-one Hindi literature is a literature composed by a generation in which the tone of rebellion and anarchy was predominant after the year 1960, under the history of Hindi literature, which is largely believed to be quite different from the New Age era
 haalaanki iske saath-saath sahajata evam janavaadee chetana kii samaanaantar dhara bhi sahitya-kshetra main pravahamaan rahi jo baad main pradhan ho gayi
 In the sixties, the rebellious consciousness movement became primarily vocal in the field of poetry
 isliye isse sambandhit saare aandolan mukhyatah kavita ke aandolan rahe
 However, the story and other genres too had a substantial impact and in the field of story also, a movement like 'akhani' took shape
 san saath ke aasapaas nayi kavita kii dhara apane se kuch alag hoti dikhne lagi
 The new twist that is targeted after sixty is not a new thing to look at all of a sudden, but only by new poetry
 saath ke baad kii kavita main asantosh, asweekruti or vidroh kaa swar bahut saaf taur par ubhara he
 The tone of dissatisfaction and disapproval is present in the new poem as well, but after sixty this tone has taken the form of more intense satire and rebellion, going too close to the broken idols of life, their brokenness, agony and rejection from it Has recognized the fierceness of nayi kavita kii sabase badi visheshta yahi he ki usne samgr jivan kii pramanik anubhutiyon ko unke jivant parivesh main vyakt kiya
 He understood the significance of the poem only in highlighting every small and big truth of life through symbols and images, by breaking the siege of the subject or cognition of the subject and made of different visions or promises
 lekin kul milakar nayi kavita ke kaviyon main pidaa ke baavjood bhavishya nirmaan ke prati sakaaratmak aashaa bhi bani rahi
 independence India, there was a lot of frustration and breakdown, but there was also a weak hope of fulfilling dreams
 mohabhang yaa disilusenment puure rup main nahin hua tha, isliye nayi kavita main yatnaa-bodh he, asweekruti kaa swar bhi he, kintu vidroh kaa ubhaar nahin he
 Gradually 'illusion' broke down, disillusioned
 vyakti kaa saamaajik parivesh or bhi kurup lagane laga, bhavishya ke sapane tuutate gayi
 In the words of Dr
 Bachchan Singh, there was no light in the sun grown by the poets - the reception of the sun went in vain
 anek sahityakaron ko do hi raste najar aane lage ki yaa to ve nayi kavita ke pradhan swar main swar milakar pidaa kii mukt anubhuti ko or gahanta se vyakt karte athwa ye sari paristhitiyaan unke samvedansheel man ko jhakazorkar or yatnaa ke bich se ubhar kar unhen vidrohi banaati hui sab-kuch asweekaar karne ko prerit karne lageen
 Both these streams remained in the literature, but immediately after the sixties, the rebel stream was predominant, most of which were malevolent or sexually perverse
 nirlakshya hone se ye kavitaayen suvidhaatmak rup se vidroh karne vaali huin yani jahaan vidroh karne main khatra anubhav ho vahaan nahin, jahaan suvidha ho vahaan vidroh hota rahaa
 The first decade of Sathotari Hindi literature is particularly influenced by modernism
 is sandarbh main dhyatavya he ki aadhunik or aadhuniktaa main antar he
 'modern' reports separation from 'medieval'
 'aadhunik' vaigyanik avishkaron or audyogikaran kaa parinaam he jabaki 'aadhuniktaa' audyogikaran kii atishyata, mahanagareey ekresata, do mahayudhon kii vibheeshikaa kaa fal he
 According to Dr
 Bachchan Singh, "modernity" is actually the name of new, non-romantic and non-romantic interviews of heterogeneous human conditions arising as a result of new science and technology
 " Modernist literature is a special kind of literature
 yah sthapit samskruti, mulya or samvednaa ko asweekaar karti he
 It does not accept the beliefs of the world, adopting the tradition as fetters
 aadhuniktaavaadi antaryaatra karata he, mulyon kaa makhul udaata he, vah vidrohi hota he
 Opposes the crowd, is a believer of the person's salvation
 vah apane ko a-maanav kii sthiti main paata he, or sneh, kritagyata aadi ko nishkasit kar detaa he
 Its characteristics or 'motif' are lack of restraint, experimentation, sabotage of literature forms, attitude of giving shock, aspiration for resentment-violence etc
 nayi kavita se vilgau anubhav karte hue kavy-kshetra main jo anek pravritiyaan sakriy raheen, unamem sabase adhik ullekhneey he ginsburg aadi america bitanicon tathaa unase prabhavit bengal ke malay raichaudhuri or subimal basaa jaise bhukhi peedi ke kaviyon ke samanaantar hindi main ubharne vaale raajakmal choudhary tathaa akavita or asweekrut kavita se sambaddh kuch anya kavi jinhone 'hetro sexuality' evam 'open sikresi' kii beet dharanaon ko apanaakar samaaj se apane ko 'disephiliet' karne kaa praytn kiya
 Nude use of sexual terminology in his poetry is often found in the form of rites and mutilation to express his distress and resentment
 raajakmal choudhary ko is dashak kii aguwai karne vaala kavi mana gaya he
 Modernity is seen in its totality in Rajkamal Chaudhary
 is samay kii adhikansh rachanaaon par choudhary kii chhap dekhi ja sakati he
 The Beatnik movement came to Hindi as a fashion and in no time became disinterested because its roots were not in the realities of the country
 vastutah ye gusse ke kavi the
 He kept venting his anger in his angry speech
 purvavarti samast mulyon or paramparaon ko nakaar kar ve apni chikhon, jakhmon or yon-vidrupataaon ko kavita main vyakt karte rahe
 However, the euthanistic, neo-progressive or neo-progressive poets, while emphasizing social values, expressed their disagreement with these beatniks
 nayi kavita ke uparant hindi kavy ke kshetra main thodi si hi avadhi main itane adhik naare sunai diye, itane adhik aandolan aaye ki vishwa ke kisi anya sahitya main itani kam avadhi main itane adhik naare or andolan kabhi nahin utpann hue
 Some of these movements and slogans were buried in the neck of time, but some grew on the path of development
 vastutah in andolanon kii poshak rachanaayen ek-duusare se milti-julati bhi raheen tathaa kabhi-kabhi to ek hi kavi kai andolanon kaa anugami rahaa
 This time of literature was a time of chaotic flood of movements
 mukhyatah kavita-pradhan in andolanon ke naam is prakaar hai- There were many pro-system movements along with anti-system movements in the poetry-movements that came like floods in this decade; But often there was a lack of systematic thinking in all these movements, due to which almost all these proved to be short-lived
 in donon prakaar ke mukhya andolanon kaa saamaanya parichay agrankit sheershakon main drashtavy he
 In the March 1962 issue of 'bharati', Sri Virendrakumar Jain announced the new poem 'sanatan Suryodayi'
 apana mantavya vyakt karte hue unka kahana tha ki " patan-paraajay, kuntha, atmpidana or jivit aatmghaat ke asujh andhkaar main aatmahaara dishaharaa hokar bhatak rahi aaj kii anaath kavy chetana ke sammukh ham-- alp se mahat main le jane vaali, andhkaar se prakaash main le jane vaali, mrityu se amrit main le jane vaali or seemaa main aseem kii lila ko utaar laane vaali-- aagaamee kal kii anivaary sanathan suryodayi nutan kavita dhara kaa dwaar mukt karte hai
 "thus the main tone of this movement was of the system, but only after 3 years, in the February 1965 issue of 'bharati', instead of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita', the tone of 'nutan Kavita' was heard
 gangaaprasad vimal jaise 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke bhootpurv samarthak swayan 'akavita' varg main sammilit ho gayi
 The Yuyotsavist poem is related to a magazine called 'yuyutsa'
 yuyutsavadi kavita ke pravartak shalab shriram singh the
 He has been of the opinion that primitive Yuyutsa is the main inspiration of literature
 unka kahana he ki "main sahityasarjan kii mul prerana ke rup main usee aadim yuyutsa ko sweekaarta hoon jo kahin na kahin prayek kranti, parivartan athwa vighatan ke mul main pramukh rahi he
 It can be anything young, zoological, puerile, platonic or platonic
 " april 1965 kii 'roopambara' main 'prarambh' ke antargat swadesh bhartiya dwaara 'sabakaa ek maatr kaaran yuyutsa' kii ghoshnaa karte hue shalab shriram singh kaa yah uddhran diya gaya tha
 'rupambara' itself appeared in the 'adhyunatan Kavita issue' of August 1966 as a 'yuyotsavist Navlakhan Pradhan co-operative effort', with statements from three poets
 sampadak ne nayi samvedansheeltaa kii baat bhi uthaayi
 Vimal Pandey, Rameshwaradatta Manav, Om Prabhakar, Bajrang Bishnoi etc
 also related themselves to this movement
 vimal pandeya ne 'yuyutsawad' ko 'engri yang main' se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya
 Shri Om Prabhakar considers Yuyutsa as a synonym for Jeejivisha, considering 'wariness' to be an eternal instinct
 bajrang bishnoi ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko yuyutsa se jod diya he
 In the July '66 issue of 'utkarsh' magazine, Shriram Shukla raised the slogan of 'rejected Poetry' and introduced 'long Rejected Poem' titled 'sexual intercourse with dead woman'
 shukla ji ke liye 'sambhog kaa anubhav hi paryaapt he-- saat mahakavy likh le jane ke liye
 The poet of the spokesperson of the rejected poem believes - "the asymmetry of not telling the truth as truth is sometimes broken by breaking the barrier and only then is the birth of the rejected poem
" " tathaa "prastut yug main vyaapt, yatharth hote hue bhi asweekrut vishisht pravritiyon, sanvegon, sthitiyon, mulyon, asangatiyon or mood kii sampreshak kavita he
 "rejected poetry is a poem of sexual perversions
 ashleel shabdon kaa prayog inke liye sahaj sweekrut he tathaa inke anusaar ye 'naapsand vyavasthaaon ko badalane ke liye' vyagr hai
 Even if they cannot present a solution, they consider it their duty to 'draw the attention of the insane people by putting question marks on them'
 'akavita' kaa sutaradhar dow0 shyaam parmaar ko mana gaya he, parantu jagadish chaturvedi bhi unke saath baraabar ke bhagidaar the or 'akavita' ke aarambhik prastaavkon main the
 In fact, there were three editors of 'akvita' magazine - Jagdish Chaturvedi, Shyam Parmar and Rabindranath Tyagi
 'akavita' patrika main akavita ke samarthan main saidhantik lekh praayah nahin chaape jate the
 Those people believed that 'we will not speak'
 parantu, dow0 shyaam parmaar ne akavita ke samarthan main 'akavita or kala-sandarbh' sheershak se baqayada pustak bhi likhi, jisamen bahuvidh akavita ko paribhaashit karne kaa praytn kiya gaya
 Jagdish Chaturvedi calls this poetry as 'abhinav Kavya', due to the awareness of the monotony, inconsistency and sacramental expression of life lived on the intellectual level by the poets of this class and separation from the ancient tradition of poetry
 Are that "they can be enumerated as meaningful carriers of 'anti-poetry'"
 " parantu shyaam parmaar akavita ko anti kavita yaa kavita virdohi nahin maanate
 They consider Akavita to be an 'investigative poem of contradictions'
 unke anusaar is kavyandolan kii visheshta is tathy main he ki "kaviyon kii pravritiyaan alag-alag manahosthitiyon se judi hai
 "" Akavita is a tenacious poem
 vah simit samay kii kavita hogi, kyonki use bhavishya main jhande nahin gaadna hoga
 Many levels of expression are possible in "and" avaita
 bhashaa or kathy main vah patibaddh nahin he, isliye 'flexbal' he
 It has complex and 'tipsy' processes - straight and broken things
 " akavita ke pravaktaa kavi ne yah bhi ullekh kiya he ki "akavita ke liye nayi kavita yaa navagit virodh yogya nahin hai
 People of the movement instinctively call it a faction or conspiracy
 " Akvita's movement was also accused of being associated with the Beatnik movement
 parantu, iske prastaavkon jagadish chaturvedi evam shyaam parmaar ne bitanicon ke vyavhaar ko spashtatah nindaneey bataaya tathaa usase 'akavita' ke judaav se bilkul inkaar kiya
 The names of Girijakumar Mathur, Prabhakar Machwe, Bharat Bhushan Aggarwal, Vimal and Atul etc
 were also found in the proposers of 'akvita' magazine, which originated from 1965 to 67
 is sandarbh main saumitr mohan tathaa mudrarakshas kii rachanaayen bhi ullekhneey hai
 Dr
 Prabhakar Machwe due to American Beatnik influence, Rajkamal Chaudhary due to Bangla influence and Trilochan and Shamsher Bahadur Singh due to Ginsberg influence also associated themselves with beat poetry
 'kriti' or 'abhivyakti' naamak patrikaon main machave ji ne apni dharna ko ghoshit bhi kiya
 Poets of 'rebel generation' published from Allahabad also showed this effect indirectly
 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak lakshmikant verma the
 Verma ji was one of the great supporters of the first 'new poem'
 unhone nayi kavita ke saidhantik vishleshan se sambandhit pehali mahatvapurn pustak likhi thi 'nayi kavita ke pratimaan'
 However, later on changing the recognition, he became the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 unhone 'taaji kavita' kaa andolan isliye chalaaya ki nayi kavita main ab kuch 'nayaapan' bhi shesh na rah gaya tha or vah ek khaas rup main pratishthit bhi ho chuki thi
 Varma ji also said that "much of the new poem was indirectly taken up by Naibhinal taking the vitality from the shadows
 " haalaanki 'taji kavita' kaa yah andolan bhi aage chal nahin sakaa
 Not even a single poet or writer who accompanied Verma ji appeared until July 1965 and "without any noise, 'fresh poetry' was buried in its own right
 " The name of Dr
 Parmanand Shrivastava is associated with committed poetry
 dow0 shrivastav kii dharna he : "main maanata hoon ki kavita ke saamne iske sivaay doosraa vikalp nahin he ki vah aaj kii sampurna manavniyati kaa saakshaatkaar kare or poonjeewaadi vyavastha dwaara prerit amanavikaran ke viruddh sangharsh kare
 "and" language is an important tool in the realm of committed poetry - the above struggle
 " dow0 shrivastav ne sangharsh ke swaroop ko bhi aage paribhaashit kiya he-- "patibaddh kavita main sangharsh sidhaa or sarthak shabd he-- uskaa koi chhadmavesh nahin he-- jo log kisi kism kii patibaddhta ko sweekaar nahin karte ve jhootha sangharsh rachate hai or us main majaa lete hai
 Thus, this movement was a system of movement away from modernism or anarchy and was a form of Marxism
 iske peeche ek vichaardhaara, ek raajnneetik drushti thi
 Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar, the narrator of Sahaja poetry, has been considered
 is andolan kaa bhi aadhuniktawaad yaa araajaktaa se dur dur tak koi sambandh nahin tha
 Its supporters included Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Acharya Nandadulare Vajpayee, Agnayya, Dinkar, Dr
 Nagendra, Dr
 Devaraj, Dr
 Indranath Madan, Dr
 Prabhakar Machve and Ramdarash Mishra
 dow0 shyaam parmaar tathaa raajakmal choudhary ne bhi ise samarthan diya tha
 In March 1967, the release of Sahaj Kavita was published
 vijyapti ke kuch ansh is prakaar hai-- "san '60 ke baad ek varg main manarism kaa croftmanship ko hi mul lakshya mana or hindi kavita kul milakar tedi rekhaon ke vyapaar ke rup main saamne aayi
 That is why it has been fashion and not very meaningful



 " atah yah kavita kaa lakshya "naye sire se kavita kii khoj karnaa" he
 Dr
 Parmanand Srivastava, Rajendra Prasad Singh, Dr
 Kumar Vimal, Shrikant Joshi, Dr
 Shyamsunder Ghosh, Dr
 Vishwambharanath Upadhyay, Dr
 Ganapatichandra Gupta and Shivapratap Singh supported Sahaja Kavita in their articles of collection called 'sahaja Kavita' published in 1968 AD
 dow0 rabindra bhramar ne apane lekh main sahaj kavita ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya-- "prastut sandarbh main 'sahaj' shabd kaa vyutpattimulk arth lenaa hoga 'sah jaayate iti sahajah
 'that is, the creation which takes birth in the tangible medium of speech with true sensation momentum, it is easy
 is drushti se anubhuti kii pramanikta praathmik vastu he
 If the feeling is direct and authentic, then the expression will be unnatural and uncomplicated
 " tathaa "sahaj kii maang vyashtimulak hote hue bhi samajasaapeksh he
 "dr
 Bhramar has also associated the question of commitment with Sahaja poetry:" Sahaja poetry is fully committed to the life and creative responsibility of his era
 uske mul main sahaj sampurna jivan kii pratiti or sahaj sugathit shilp ke madhyam kii khoj kaa ek eemaandaar praytn nihit he
 " navagit kaa naam farvari 1958 main mujffarpur se prakashit 'gitangini' naamak patrika main dikhaai diya
 Some new songs were also compiled in this magazine
 kuch lekhak navagit kaa vikaas nayi kavita ke hi samanaantar maanate hai or use nayi kavita kii ek vishesh style maanate hai
 The first collected anthology of 'navgeet', 'kavita', was published in 1964 in the editing of Om Prabhakar
 iske saath hi dow0 rabindra bhramar, ramdarsh mishra tathaa dow0 ramesh kuntal megh navagit ke pravaktaaon ke rup main saamne aaye
 In this compilation, songs of many lyricists from Nirala to the new generation were compiled
 navagit kaa yah andolan anya saathottaree kshanjivi andolanon se bilkul bhinn rahaa
 Neither it had anything to do with anarchy etc
 nor any tendency to give that kind of shock etc
