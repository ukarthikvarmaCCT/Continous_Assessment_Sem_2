 where barooth di spinoja yahudee mul ke dach darshanik the
 His changed name was 'benedict de Spinoza'
 unhone ullekhneey vaigyanik abhikshmata kaa parichay diya kintu unke kaaryon kaa mahatv unke mrityu ke uparant hi samjha ja sakaa
 Spinoza was born in 1632 in Holland, a Jewish family
 ve swabhaav se ekantapriya, nirbhik tathaa nirlobh the
 He was shown greed to abandon his beliefs, conspired to assassinate him, was excommunicated from the Jewish sect, yet he remained adamant
 sansaarik jivan unako ek asay rog ke samaan jaan padataa tha
 Therefore, he used to be restless to get rid of him and attain God
 spinoja kaa sabase prasiddh granth unka 'athiks' he
 But in addition to this he has practiced seven or eight texts
 principles ov philasphi tathaa metaphysical cojitations kaa prakaashan 1663 main or trectatus thiologico polyticas kaa prakaashan 1670 main, bina unke naam ke hua
 His three incomplete texts are Tractractus Politicus, Tractatus de Intelectus Emendadione, Grammatis linguis Hebresi - published in 1677 the same year after his death, with his main treatise Ethics
 bahut dinon baad unke ek or granth trectatus brevis di deo kaa pataa chalaa, jiskaa prakaashan 1858 main hua
 Many texts have been written about Spinoza's life and philosophy, which are listed in Spinoza in the Light of Vedanta
 is kalpana kaa ki dravya kii sristi ho sakati he at: vichaartatv or vistaartatv dravya hai, spinoja ne ghor virodh kiya
 Matter is self-illuminated and independent, it cannot be created
 at: vichaartatv or vistaartatv, jo srist hai, dravya nahin balki oopaadhi hai
 Spinoza atheists can be said to mean that he opposed the idea of god prevalent in Judaism and Christianity
 spinoja kaa dravya yaa ishwar nirgun, niraakaar tathaa vyaktitwaheen sarvyaapee he
 To somehow make God special is to limit it
 is arth main spinoja kaa ishwar advait vedant ke brahm ke samaan he
 Just as Brahman has two titles, name and form, similarly Spinoza's two titles of matter are thoughts and extensions
 ye dravya ke gun nahin he
 Like the form of Brahman's form, matter also has properties that are proved by its form, such as its uniqueness, independence, perfection etc
 vichaar tathaa vistaar ko gun na kahkar oopaadhi kahana adhik uparyukt he, kyonki spinoja ke anusaar ve dravya ke swaroop ko samajhane ke liye buddhi dwaara aropit hai
 Such infinite titles are valid for Spinoza
 ishwar kii ye oopaadhiyaan bhi aseem hai parantu ishwar kii nissimta nirpeksh he vahaan in oopaadhiyon kii aseemta saapeksh he
 God is the creator of the world, but not in the form that he creates the whole world with his willpower
 vastav main ishwar main ichhashakti aropit karnaa usko simit karnaa he
 But this does not mean that God is not independent; His freedom is his secularism, not his free will, because of this Spinoza does not consider the world to be the purpose
 ishwar jagat kaa kaaran usee arth main he jisamen swarnapind aabhushan kaa yaa akaash tribhuj kaa
 But this does not mean that God is changeable
 jagat kalpit he kintu uskaa aadhaar ishwar satya he
 God and the world are different, but not divisible
 jis prakaar ishwar main ichhashakti nahin he vaise hi manushya main bhi swatantra ichhashakti naam kii koi vastu nahin he
 The reality is that each thought is caused by another thought, so no idea is independent
 saath hi spinoja kii vichaaragegat par bhautik jagat kaa prabhaav nahin padataa
 The work-cause-chain is different but both are the same substance, so they seem related
 vyavhaarajagat main spinoja niyativaadee jaan padate hai
 They say that the rejection of willpower does not affect our behavior and conduct, so it is unnecessary to avoid it
 vaastaviktaa to yah he ki yadi hamako yah drudh nishchay ho jaae ki sansar kii kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa icchanirpeksh he to hamako badi shanti mili
 Man remains unrestful as long as there is hope for change in the cause-chain
 ichaswatantray main vishwaas hi hamaara bandhan he
 Desire freedom should be used to resolve will
 ichaswatantray ke shaman se rajsik vritti tathaa maansik vikaron kaa shaman hota he or man ishwarchinthan ke yogya hota he
 The ultimate goal of life is the attainment of God, because only then can the attainment of eternal death
 ishwar kii prapti ishwar se prem karne se hoti he parantu prem kaa arth bhavukta nahin balki tanmayata he
 This is why Spinoza called this love intellectual love
 ishwarathnmayata kaa ek arth yah bhi he ki ham sadachaar sadachaar ke liye karen, kyonki sadachaar ke uplakshya main pratifal kii ichha rakhana ek bandhan kii sristi karnaa he
 When our mind becomes divine and our outlook is a constant approach, then we experience identification with God and attain absolute peace
 spinoja ke vichaar main ishwar ke sagun saakaar rup kaa bhi mahatv he
 This imagination is very useful for those whose intellectual level is low and for those who have awakened faith in their mind by virtue, realization of God
 ishwar ko na maanane kii apeksha sagun saakaar ishwar ko maananaa shreyaskar he
 Spinoza's idea was all-encompassing, which is why in today's era people are increasingly looking towards Spinoza

 Refraction of a Perspex block
 Refraction is a change in the direction of a wave due to a change in its speed
 This is most commonly seen when a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 90 degrees or 0 degrees
 Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but any type of wave can deflect when it interacts with one medium, for example when sound waves pass through one medium into another or when water waves separate into one Let's go in deep water
 Refraction is described by Snell's law, which states that θ1 is related to the angle of incidence and angle of refraction θ2 jahaan v1 or v2 sambandhit media main lahar veg hai, or n1 or n2 apvartak suchakank

 Our senses have limited ability to function, and so is our eyes
 isaki bhi apana ek seemaa he
 a very distant object that cannot be seen with an empty eye can be seen with a telescope or a detailed description of a very close object can be seen more clearly than a microscope
 yahan sookshmdarshi ke kshetra main 1865 i
 se ab tak jo pragati hui he usee kaa ullekh kiya ja rahaa he: a single convex lens, commonly called a magnification lens, can be called the simplest microscope
 ise 'jebi sookshmdarshi' bhi kehete hai
 a simple microscope is made of a combination of two convex lenses located at a certain distance

 Although the laws of reflection, refraction, and linear transmission of light were known to Greek philosophers a few centuries before Christ, the law of incidence of incidence and sine of angle of refraction was not invented until the late seventeenth century
 holland ke snaill or france ke dekart ne alag-alag iskaa avishkaar kiya
 Alhazain, the Arabian astrologer around 1000 AD, formulated the laws of reflection and refraction, but they were not in the sine, but in a long distance

 In fact, two adjacent points in an object can never be distinguished if the wavelength of the light in which those points are observed does not exceed twice the distance between those points
 is prakaar se yah unke bilgau ko simit kar detaa he
 This is called the limit of resolution

 sabase choti parabegni or avarakt kirnon ke liye yah seemaa kramash: 1500 A° or 3850 A° ke lagbhag hogi, jahaan 1 A° = 10-8 semi

 Let us think of ourselves as former microscopists and consider the reforms that we wanted to do at that time
 saadhaarant: ham apni aashaaon ko chaar baton par kendrit karte hai: The above mentioned improvements or difficulties with the nature of the object, the type of illumination and the photography technology invented the x ray in 1895
 parantu san 1912 tak eks kiran kii tarang prakruti kaa koi pataa nahin tha jab tak vaan laue ne use siddh nahin kiya
 Now it was hoped that X-ray microscopes could be made
 at: us samay yah vichaar tyaag diya gaya
 a few years later, in 1923, The Broglie determined the wave nature of the electron, and in 1927 AD Davison and Germer in New York and GP in Aberdeen
 Tamson confirmed it in 1928 AD
 electron ke kiran punj bhi upyukt vidyut yaa chumbakeey kshetra dwaara mode ja sakate hai
 In 1947, Knoll, Rusk and Brukh presented microscopes that could be successfully used
 is vikiran kaa tarangadairghy nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Here h is the constant of Planck, m is mass of electron and q is velocity
 veg voltata kaa falan he, jo electron kiranpunaj kii twarit karne ke liye prayukt hota he
 The resolution of up to 10 a ° was possible with this microscope and its magnification capacity was very high

10-8 mimi vistaar kii vastuen dekhi ja sakati hai
 This is undoubtedly a major advance and many new inventions are associated with it
 aaj electron sookshmdarshiki kii apni anek takneekiyaan hai
 Like high-energy electrons, x rays have very high solubility and are less quickly absorbed, as are high-energy electrons
 at: choti apaardarshee vastuon kii aantarik sanrachana gyaat karne main eks kirane prayukt kii ja sakati hai
 Ehrenwerk drew the first X-ray microscope or shadow microscope in 1947 and was corrected in 1948 by Kink Patrick and Bejoy
 electron sookshmdarshi kii tarah yahan nirvaat kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Only fine holes are required for good reflection
 iskaa arth he ki isse kam vikiran pravesh karata he or isiilie udbhasana bahut bada hota he
 The back has to enlarge the picture for which an emulsion of very fine particles is required
 ab ham saamaanya drishy prakaash sookshmdarshiki kii ore dekhen
 Before we discuss the progress made in that direction, we have to keep in mind the aspirations of microscopists 40 years ago
 ekmaatr upkaran se sab aavashyaktaaon kii saath hi purti sambhav na thi
 The increase in resolution is limited by the value of a numerical gateway whose value cannot exceed 1

 It is a function of the focus distances of the used laces

 But at the same time the functional distance is destroyed
 aise hi vichaaron ke kaaran lens ke sthaan main darpanon ke upyog se paravarti sookshmdarshi kaa nirmaan barch ne bristol main 1947 i
 main kiya
 In principle, the use of radiation up to ultraviolet rays was possible here
 iskaa sankhyik dwarak kam hota he par avarnataa or adhik kriyaatmak duuri kaa isamen laabh hota he
 Since quartz does not absorb radiation up to 2000 a °, the minimum resolution distance would be 1,000 a ° would be obtained from a microscope using quartz lenses, thus using an ultraviolet radiation with this type of configuration is called an 'ultraviolet microscope'

 Prof
 Zernik used art contrast illumination in microscopes
 is takneekee ko kala vaishamy sookshmdarshiki kehete the
 It is a method of showing the structure of colorless especially transparent materials
 vibhinn sanrachanaon ke kaaran unamem krambhang dekha jaataa he, jaise mechak ke yakrut main
 Biologists seek the help of pigments to improve the contrast
 praaia: vaishamy varna filter se aisa kiya jaataa he
 Only a few types of crystals can be analyzed with polarized light, but all types of crystals can be studied with artesunate
 is takneekee main abhiranjan ke rup main kritrim varnon kaa upyog nahin hota
 Defects in hygiene are reported to be that although the derangement does not destroy the cells of organisms, it cannot be said that it does not affect the organisms or cells at all
 kala-vaishamy-vidhi kaa laabh yah he ki pradipti jo prayek sookshmdarshi main aavashyak he, jeev ko dekhne ke liye or kuch karnaa nahin padataa
 In the art contrast microscope, the microscope remains the normal type
 isamen keval yah naveenta rahati he ki ek naveen prakashmay yukti jod di jaati he
 p is a glass plate with a circular groove
 plate par calcium fluoride kaa paardarshak lep chadha rahata he
 The thickness of the paste remains the same
 nirvaat main vaashpan dwaara lep chadhaaya jaataa he
 The thickness of the coating remains so that the time difference between the light passed by the groove and the other part of the plate is a quarter of the vibration
 da pardaa he jisamen ek valayakaar kaat hoti he jisase abhidrishyak main utana prakaash paarit hota he jitna kalapatt ke khaanche main bharegaa
 The light dispersed and diffracted by the object is not passed through the groove and when this light reaches the reflection, it is not mixed with the light directly reaching the source and the image is formed
 abhinaytrak main yahi pratibimb dikhaai padataa he
 Different parts of the object display different frequencies in light according to the refractive index, so the reflection seen in the actress is a refractive figure of the object
 yah sookshmdarshi 1952 i
 tak prayog ke liye uplabdh ho gaya
 In 1952, Prof
 Zernik received the Nobel Prize for this achievement
 dison ne 1951 i
 main is samasya ko bhinn rup se suljhaayaa jiske falswaroop unhone vyatikaran sookshmdarshi kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen paramparaagat kalavaishamy sookshmdarshi se kuch shreshthata thi
 In this, the object is pressed into the middle of two semicircular plates of glass and is seen with a special mirror system in such a way that some light goes straight through the object without passing through the object and the remaining light passes through the object
 is prakaar utpann vyaktikaran finj vastu kii apvartanaank sanrachana ko vyakt kar detaa he
 In fact, this two types of illumination are a means of great importance for a blurred background and artistic human

 We see that many aspirations of microscopists of forty years ago have been fulfilled
 iskaa yaheen ant nahin he kyonki kisi shodh kaa ant nahin hota or yahi baat sookshmdarshiki ke liye bhi he or aavardhan kshamta ke vibhedan kshamta kii upar di gai seemaa kii vruddhi ke prayaas ab bhi ho rahe hai
 With the use of new types of glass and plastic, further advancement in the technology of microscopy is necessary
 in sab sookshmdarshiyon se, jinka varnan kiya gayaahai, keval vistaar main hi vibhedan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 There is another branch of microscopy which is very spectacular and interesting

 Through this, depth resolution can also be detected

 Among the Bhaktikal poets, Nambadas, the disciple of Swami Agradas, holds a special place
 antassakshya ke abhaav main inaki janm tathaa mrityu kii tithiyaan anishchit hai
 There is a substantial difference in the dates set by Mishrabandhu, Dr
 Shyamsundardas, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Dr
 Deendayalu Gupta, Acharya Kshitimohan Sen etc
 inke prasiddh granth 'bhaktamaal' kii tikaa priyadas ji ne sanwat 1769 main, sau varsh baad, likhi thi
 On this basis, the time of Nabdasa is believed to be between the middle and late 17th century
 nabhadas ke janmasthan, mata pita, jati aadi ke sambandh main bhi pramaanon ke abhaav main adhikarpurvak kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 'radhakrishnadas' editor of Bhaktamnavali wrote on the basis of legend that Nabhadas was born and his father died in childhood
 us samay desh main akaal kii sthiti thi, at: mata inkaa paalanposhan na kar sakin or inhen van main chhodkar chali gayi
 Coincidentally Mr
 Kilh and Agradas ji were going through the same forest, they saw the child and brought it up
 baad main unheen mahatmaon ke prabhaav se nabhadas ne aankhon kii jyoti praapt kii or agradas ji ne inhen dikshit kiya
 According to tradition, the Nabhadas belonged to the Dome or Maharashtrian Brahmin caste
 tikaakar priyadas ne inhen hanumanwansheey maharashtriya brahman mana he
 The commentator Roopkala ji has considered them to be of Dom caste, saying that Dom was not a low caste, but Kalavant, Dhadhi, Bhat, Dom etc
 are the names of the ganavidyapravirin castes
 mishrabandhuon ne bhi inhen hanumanwanshi maanate hue likhaa he ki marwari main hanuman shabd 'dom' ke liye prayukt hota he
 Three works of Nabhadas are available - 'bhaktamala', 'ashtayam', 'sphutta Pad of Rambhakti'
 'bhaktamaal' main lagbhag do sau bhakton kaa charitragaan he
 'ashtayam' Brajbhasha is available separately in both prose and verse
 ram sambadhi sfoot padon kaa ullekh khoj reporton main miltaa he
 In all these three works, the basic basis of Nabdas's fame is 'bhaktamala'
 isaki pracheenatam prati kaa nirmaan abhi tak nahin ho sakaa or na is granth kaa vaigyanik sampadan hi hua he
 Therefore, what was its shape originally, it cannot be said
 kud vidwaanon ke anusaar isamen maala ke manakon ke samaan 108 chand the
 But in the copy of the year 1770, its verse number is 194
 priyadas kii prasiddh tikaa main 214 padya die gaye hai or acharya shukla isamen 316 chand maanate hai
 Whatever the original shape, Nabdas in 'bhaktamala' has sung about two hundred devotees of his predecessor or contemporary in Chappay verses
 kavi ne in bhakton ke janm maran kii tithiyon athwa anya sthamal tathyon kii gananaa main vishesh ruchi vyakt nahin kii
 The poet's primary goal has been to instill faith in the hearts of the public by describing their supernatural events in the lives of the devotees
 charitavarnan main nabhadas ne praaia: teen stroton se saamagree sankalan kii he - kinvadantiyaan, dharmik granth tathaa samakaleen bhakton ke sambandh main unka apana gyaan
 Nabhadas did not do any favors here; All devotees of Nirguna or Sagun ideology have the same reverence in mind
 yah avashya he ki, malukadas dharamdas, dadudayaal, nanak, aadi bhakton ke sambandh main 'bhaktamaal' main kuch nahin kaha gaya
 But the reason for this is not the feeling of raga
 kadachit nabhadas ke sanmukh bhakton kii koi nishchit suchi nahin thi, athwa ho saktaa he ki in santon ke naamon kaa kavi ko samaran na aayaa ho
 'bhaktamal' is composed in Vrajbhasha
 isaki bhashaa style praudh evam parimarjeet he
 In the Charit narration, the poet has followed the same style
 is prakaar ke vishaynirupan main praaia: vistaar kii sambhaavna rahati he, kintu nabhadas ne bhashaa par apurv adhikaar kaa parichay diya he or praaia: ek hi chand main bhakt vishesh ke pramukh gunon kaa varnan kar diy he
 Despite the use of compound, there was no lack of Prasadgun in the language of 'bhaktamal'
 sankshipt or sidhi abhivyakti ke kaaran uske chhandon kii anek panktiyaan sookhti ban gai hai
 The contribution of 'bhaktamal' is very important in keeping the life of the devotees and devotees safe
 priyadas, vaishnavadas, laldaas, balakram, rupakala, malukadas, aadi anek vidwaanon ne is granth par vividh tikaayen prastut kar prastut granth kii mahima ko sweekaar kiya he
 In addition to commentators, later many poets also gave birth to a new tradition by creating various devotees and slang on this basis

 june, 1959 se vidhivat lekhan-kaary aarambh kiya
 Surendra Chaudhary's first published work was a critical essay, published in 1951 in 'sahitya Sandesh' edited by Babu Gulabrai
 aarambh main unhone anek kavitaayen tathaa ek kahani bhi likhi thi; parantu mukhya rup se unhone apane kaaryakshetra rup main 'hindi aalochana' ko hi chunaa or iske liye unhone baqayada puri taiyaari kii

 Namwar Singh have a historic contribution in giving Hindi story-review a true form of balanced criticism
 isse kuch or baad tak ke samay ko sametate hue madhuresh ji kaa maananaa he ki inamen sabase adhik kshamtawan aalochak surendra choudhary the
 The first book of Hindi story-criticism in the true sense of criticism was of Surendra Chaudhary - 'hindi Story: Process and Text'
 sitambar 1963 main bharti bhawan, patna se iskaa pratham sanskaran prakashit hua tha
 Shambhu Gupta believes that this book was undoubtedly unique when it was written and published
 tab hindi main kahani-aalochana ke kshetra main lagbhag shunya jaisi sthiti thi
 In this book Surendra Chaudhary decided to travel from zero to the summit
 kahani kii rachana-prakriya spasht karte hue unhone rachanaatmak yatharth kii pakad tathaa sangyojan, kathy evam shilp kii anyonyashrayita tathaa saapeksh jivan-vivek kii sarjanaatmak abhivyakti ke rup main kahani ke sanghatanon kaa jo santulit swaroop dikhalaayaa vah aaj bhi mandand he
 The planning and deliberation of the story process and text into different sections has also been seen as a historical limitation and has been considered as the reason for avoiding ideological commitment, but a conscious reader reading those sections separately Can automatically target that neither their 'process' is devoid of text nor their 'text' is different from process
 donon main donon anusyut hai
 Nevertheless, the separate requirement of 'text' is to show the whole internal exploration of the story and the integrated form of architecture, making it clear in totality how and why a story is a 'success story'
 isi ke abhaav main to armbh se baad tak kii hindi kahani-samiksha ek anathak bhatkaav ke giraft main he jiske tahat kabhi to keval kisi vichaar ke kaaran kisi kahani kii prashansa / ninda kar di jaati he to kabhi aadhuniktaa ke naam par drishy-vidhaan kaa hi moh gher letaa he
 In the absence of viewing the story as a whole, many critics also surround the discourse of informative discourse, which they feel proud of as a plurality of their own
 surendra choudhary kii aalochana in saare khataron se bahut pehle aagaah kar chuki he
 Surendra Chaudhary's views on Phanishwar Nath Renu, from his unique preface to the book and the publication of young critic Udayashankar in the book form of his previously published articles, as far as possible, have reached contemporary creators

Dr
 Manager Pandey's two statements about understanding and evaluating Surendra Chaudhary are of great use - "surendra Chaudhary is a critic who has serious literature-conscience and has a deep connection with life-wisdom and world-conscience
 unki chaahe 'nayi kahani' or baad kii kahaniyon kii aalochana ho, 'godaan' kaa vishleshan ho, 'mailaa anchal' kaa vivechan ho yaa 'mukti-prasang' kaa moolyankan ho, in sabake saavdhaan pathakon ko surendra choudhary ke sahitya-vivek, jivan-vivek or jagat-vivek kaa saakshaatkaar avashya hoga
 "in another place he considers him to be perfecting the criticism of the Hindi story, saying that" Surendra Chaudhary is famous as a critic of the story but he is also a capable critic of the Hindi novel
 ek to unhone renu ke sabhi upanyaason kii samalochna kii he or duusare premachand ke godaan kii bhi aisi aalochana likhi he jaisi na unase pehle kisi ne likhi thi or na baad main kisi ne likhi

 Western scholars consider Rishis to be the creators of Vedas
 vaidic sahitya ko shruti bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki puraane rishiyon ne is sahitya ko shravan-parampara se grahan kiya tha
 Later, the texts written after remembering this knowledge were called Smriti

 us kaa prayog mezposh ke rup main, yaa manch par nahin dhakaa ja saktaa, isse kisi murti ko dhakaa nahin ja saktaa na hi kisi aadharshila par daalaa ja saktaa tha
 Until 2005, it could not be used as a dress or as a uniform

 The flag of each country should be on a separate pillar, the national flag of any country should not be hoisted one on top of the other
 aise samay main bhartiya dhvaj ko shuru main, ant main rakhaa jaae or varnakram main anya deshon ke saath bhi rakhaa jaae
 If the flag is to be hoisted in a circular manner, the flag of other countries should be placed clockwise in the direction of the national flag by placing the national flag at the beginning of the cycle, until a flag comes next to the national flag
 bharat kaa rashtriya dhvaj hameshaa pehle fahraaya janaa chahie or sabase baad main utaara janaa chahie
 When the flag is placed in the shape of a multiplication symbol, the Indian flag should be placed in front and the other flags should be on the right side
 jab sanyukt raashtra kaa dhvaj bhartiya dhvaj ke saath fahraaya ja rahaa he, to use donon taraf pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he

 The pillar of the national flag should be ahead of the other pillars, if it is in the same group, it should be at the top
 yadi jhande ko anya jhandon ke saath juluus main le jaaya ja rahaa ho to jhande ko juluus main sabase aage hona chahie, yadi ise kai jhandon ke saath le jaaya ja rahaa he to ise juluus main sabase aage hona chahie
 When the flag is displayed in a closed room, in public meetings or in conferences of any kind, it should be placed on the right side because the place is official
 jab jhanda haul yaa anya baithak main ek vaktaa ke bagal main pradarshit kiya ja rahaa ho to yah vaktaa ke daahine haath par rakhaa janaa chahie
 When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be placed to the right of the audience
 kesaria pattee ko upar rakhte hue is dhvaj ko puri tarah se failaa kar pradarshit karnaa chahie
 If the flag is hung perpendicular to the wall behind the stage, the saffron strip should be placed in front of the viewer so that the top is up
 yadi jhanda kisi juluus yaa parade main anya jhande yaa jhandon ke saath le jaaya ja rahaa he to, jhande ko juluus ke dahine ore yaa sabase aage bich main rakhana chahie
 The flag carries a specificity at the time of unveiling of a statue or monument, or plaque, but should not be used to cover an object
 sammaan ke chihn ke rup main ise kisi vyakti yaa vastu ko dhankna nahin chahie
 Platoon colors, organizational or institutional flags can be covered as a mark of respect
 kisi samaaroh main fahraate samay yaa jhande ko utaarte samay yaa jhanda kisi parade se guzar rahaa he yaa kisi samiksha ke dauraan, sabhi upasthit vyaktiyon ko dhvaj kaa saamana karnaa chahie or dhyaan se khadey hona chahie
