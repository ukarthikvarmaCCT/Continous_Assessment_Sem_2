 On his return to Nagpur in 1915, he became active in the Congress and later became the secretary of the Vidarbha Provincial Congress
 When the country level session of the Congress was held in Nagpur in 1920, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar presented the first proposal in the Congress about the goal of complete independence, then it was not passed
 In 1921, Satyagraha was arrested in the non-cooperation movement of the Congress and he was imprisoned for one year
 By then he had become so popular that veterans like Pandit Motilal Nehru and Hakim Ajmal Kha addressed the gathering organized to welcome him upon his release

 This was the reason that when the anti-salt law movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1930, he personally handed over the responsibility of the Sangh chief to Dr
 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr
 Hedgewar Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar in all the Sangh branches on January 30
 It was resolved to attain full swaraj by hoisting the tricolor

 Since Keshav lived in Calcutta at the home of his elder brother Mahadev's friend Shyam Sundar Chakraborty, the local people used to know and address him by the name of Keshav Chakraborty
 unki asaadhaaran yogyata ko maddenjar rakhte hue unhen pehle anushilan samiti kaa saadhaaran sadsy banaaya gaya

 In such a situation, many Hindu leaders went to malabar-kerala to know the state of Kerala and to help the looted Hindus there, among them prominent Hindu Mahasabhai leader of Nagpur, Dr
 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, Dr
 Hedgewar, Arya Samaj leader Swami Shraddhanand ji etc
 After a while there were hindu-muslim riots in Nagpur and many other cities too
 Distracted by such incidents, Dr
 Munje in Nagpur has made some famous Called a meeting of Hindu leaders, including Dr
 Hedgewar and Dr
 Paranjpe, in this meeting they decided to make a hindu-militia, the aim was to "protect Hindus and make Hindustan a strong Hindu nation"

 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc

This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa
 In 1937, Veer Savarkar's termination ended and after that he could participate in politics

 Among the founders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the two main men were Dr
 Munje and Dr
 Hedgewar Hindu Mahasabhai and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh formed the basis of the interpretation of Hindu and Hindu nationalism propounded by Veer Savarkar, as well as the original mantra of Veer Savarkar- Untouchability
 The principle of prevention and militarization of Hindus was accepted

 Nizam, the Muslim ruler of Hyderabad, had made the living of Hindus there difficult
 yahan tak ki koi hindu mandir nahin bana saktaa tha or yajna aadi karne par bhi pratibandh tha

 Media favoritism refers to the partiality of journalists and news producers
 media pakshpaat report kii jane vaali ghatnaon evam kahaniyon ke chunaav ke rup main ho saktaa he yaa uski prastuti ke rup main bhi ho saktaa he
 Scholars of media-studies believe that mass media's conceptual origins are propaganda
 solahavin sadi main catholic mat ke jisut anuyaayiyon ne protestanton dwaara kii jane vaali aalochana ke jawaab main latin bhashaa ke shabd ‘propaganda’ se nikalne vaale taatparyon ke aadhaar par dharm-sudhaar virdohi vichaardhaaratmak muhim chalaai thi
 The understanding behind this was that people do not imbibe any message until it is given to them again and again
 attharahavin sadi ke europee gyanoday ke baad bani paristhitiyon main sandesh-rachana kii prakriya main parivartan hua, kyonki uske baad uttarottar votaron, upabhoktaaon or darshakon kii dilchaspiyon kaa dhyaan rakhana zaruri hota chalaa gaya
 The modern state took the priority of educating and training the common citizens, except for the censorship imposed under exceptional circumstances of foreign invasion
 media kii swa-ghoshit tatasthta yahan rajya ke kaam aayi
 Governments and national elite achieved great success by putting media in the project of nation and state-building by creating a national consensus instead of government machinery
 chunki maas-media bahut bade paimaane par prachaar- saamagree kaa utpaadan manoranjan, samachar, vishleshan, vigyaapan or samvadaparak charchaaon ke madhyam se kar saktaa he, isliye beesvin sadi main isaki propaganda sambandhi kshamtaaon kaa dohan karne ke liye corporate jagat, raashtra-rajya or raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon ke pairokaron ne khuli or chhipi tarkiben viksit kii hai
 Pragmatism is argued from the media that not all facts and events can be broadcast, so some of them have to be selected and some have to be released
 chayan or chhantai kii is prakriya se hi pakshpaat kaa janm hota he or purv-nirdhaarit sahmati gadhane main madad milti he
 Emphasis is placed on select facts to appease the advertisers, to serve the interests of the media-owners, not to hurt the perceived sentiments of the majority or minorities, and to reinforce the dominant ideology of the nation-state 
 media-pakshpaat ke dharmik, nasli, langik, ayuparak, sexual, jatigat or jaateeytavaadi ayaamon ko bhi rekhaankit kiya gaya he
 Everyone knows that the media is biased, but it is a difficult task to characterize this attitude and criticize it in detail
 pakshpaat ke aarope ke jawaab main media ke pairokaar aksar poochhate hai ki kya kisi ghatana kii repotag karne gayi samvaadadaata dwaara donon pakshon dwaara apane-apane haq main kii gayi baton ko silsilewar pesh kar dena hi nishpaksh patrakarita he? ye log kehete hai ki ‘balanced’ repotag kaa matlab hota he ridhhin or dharhin patrakarita
 It is obvious that this argument does not consider neutrality as absurd and 'commitment' as 'partiality'
 agar media apni pakshadharata ko chhipaane kii koshish nahin kar rahaa he, to uske ekatarfaapan ko uski quality ke rup main grahan kiya ja saktaa he
 However, if an attempt is being made to forge a certain kind of consensus under the guise of neutrality, detailed studies are needed to detect and then reveal it
 2004 main kiye gayi ek adhyayan ke mutabik media-pakshpaat kii toh lene ke liye baarah tareeke istemaal kiye ja sakate hai : patrakaron, media-abhijanon or patrakarita ke chaatro ke raajnneetik / saanskrithik drushtikonon kaa surveykshan kiya ja saktaa he; patrakaron ke puraane peshevraana samparkon par nazar daali ja sakati he; pramukh patrakaron kii raajnneetik aasthaaon kaa udghaatan karne vaale uddhran jamaa kiye ja sakate hai; computer ke zariye kii-vards kaa istemaal karke media-saamagree ke saar or shrenee kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he; news stories dwaara suzaayi gayi nitiyon kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he; kisi ghatana ke nakaaratmak / sakaaratmak kawarej ko rekhaankit kiya ja saktaa he; media ke un logon ke kariyar par nigaah phenki ja sakati he jinke haath main nirnayakari adhikaar hote hai; soochna / manoranjan-saamagree ko prabhavit karne vaale vigyaapan- sroton kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he; media par sarkari propegande or jan-sampark udyog ke asar par dhyaan diya ja saktaa he, media dwaara tikaa-tippanee ke liye chune gayi visheshgyon or pravaktaaon ko un hit-samoohon or vichaardhaara-pairokaron ke barakes rakh kar dekha ja saktaa he jinhen media nahin chunata; or corporeshnon or vaanijya associationon dwaara patrakaron ko kiye gayi bhaashan vagairah dene ke badale kiye gayi bhugtanon par nigaah daali ja sakati he
 The Glasgow Media Group study has been well-known in analyzing media advocacy in an attempt to find out how TV and newspapers serve corporate interests against the workers' movement
 is adhyayan par bhi pakshadharata kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he ki vah media dwaara mazaduron ke bare main istemaal kii gayi jin abhivyaktiyon ko apmanjanak qaraar detaa he, vah darasal mazaduron dwaara varnit aatmachavi se hi lee gayi hai
 a well-known study establishing a clear connection between the media and propaganda is the result of Noam Chomsky's efforts to show how US corporate powers used filters of 'anti-communist ideology' to hurt the credibility of independent media
 Huh
 duusari taraf, viksit deshon ke media par kiye gayi adhyayanon se nateeja niklaa he ki vah aam taur par anudaarataavaadi vichaar ke mukaable udaarataavaadi vichaardhaara kaa paksh letaa he
 a 1986 study on media-elite revealed the fact that the newsrooms of big newspapers and broadcast networks, such as the New York Times and Washington Post, dominated the left-hand liberal trends
 saamaajik or raajnneetik vivaadon ke bare main patrkaar or vishleshak aam taur se jo ravaiya apanaate hai us par unke nijee vichaaron kii gahari chhap hoti he
 Media-bias and the Indian media have not been equated with the West
 azaadi se pehle puraa bhartiya media do dhruvon main banta hua tha
 All the major newspapers in English openly supported the colonial rule and the media of Indian languages, without exception, stood in favor of the national movement
 ise ‘pakshpaat’ or ‘pakshadharata’ ke bich kiye ja sakane vaale fark kii misaal samajha ja saktaa he
 The English media changed overnight to the national media as soon as the transfer of power took place on August 15 in 1947
 iske baad kamobesh assi ke dashak ke ant tak bharat ke saamaajik-raajnneetik aadhunikeekaran or vaikasik arthshaastra par aadhaarit mishrit arthnitiyon ke model kaa rasta saafe karne ke liye bani rashtriya sahmati main media ke sabhi pahaluon ne apane-apane tarah se yogadan kiya
 In the nineties, there were new polarizations in Indian politics and society around the emerging forces of the temple, the temple and the market, which dissolved that national consensus
 media ke vibhinn hisse kabhi pakshadharata or kabhi pakshpaat kaa ravaiya apanaate hue samay-samay par in shaktiyon kaa samarthan or virodh karne lage
 The situation today is that the Indian media is almost without exception favoring economic reforms and globalization
 media ne ise nayi rashtriya sahmati ke rup main grahan kar liya he

 The social reform movements in Bengal in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the rise of patriot-nationalist consciousness and the unique progress made in literature-art-culture are called the renaissance of Bengal
 is dauraan samaaj sudhaarkon, sahityakaron or kalakaaron ne stri, vivaah, dahej, jatipratha or dharm sambandhi sthapit paramparaon ko chunauti di
 This development of Bengal left an indelible mark on the creations of the overall Indian modernity
 isi navajagaran ke dauraan bhartiya rashtrawaad ke shuruaati roopon kii sanrachanaayen saamne aayin
 The renaissance of Bengal is believed to extend from Raja Rammohan Roy to Rabindranath Thakur
 is avadhi kaa suvyavyasthit adhyayan karne vaale itihaaskaar sushobhan sarkaar likhte hai, ‘angrezi raaj, poonjividi arthvyavastha or aadhunik pashchimi samskruti kaa sabase pehla prabhaav bengal par padaa jisase ek aisa navajagaran hua jise aamtaur par bengal ke rinesaan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Bengal's conscious awareness of the changing modern world for almost a century was ahead of the rest of India
 is lihaaz se kaha ja saktaa he ki bharat ke aadhunik jaagran main bengal dwaara nibhaai gayi bhoomika kii tulana europee rinesaan ke sandarbh main italy kii bhoomika se kii ja sakati he
 'like the Italian Renaissance, the renaissance of Bengal was not a mass movement
 isaki prakriya or prasar bhadralok tak hi simit tha
 In Bhadralok too, the renaissance had its influence mostly on the Hindu part
 is dauraan kuch musalmaan hastiyaan bhi ubharin, par bengal kaa navajagaran aanshik rup se hi musalmaan navajagaran kaha ja saktaa he
 It is broadly believed that Bengal's renaissance began with Rammohan Roy and ended with Rabindranath Thakur
 sushobhan sarkaar ne ise paanch charnon main baant kar dekhne kaa prayaas kiya he : pehali avadhi 1814 se 1833, jisaki kendriya hasti raja rammohan raay the
 In 1814 he came to live in Kolkata and in 1833 he died in London
 duusari avadhi unki mrityu se 1857 ke vidroh tak jaati he
 The third period extends to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885
 chauthi avadhi 1905 main bengal ke vibhaajan tak or paanchavin avadhi swadeshi andolan se asahyog andolan or mahatma gandhi ke netritv kii shuruyaat tak yani 1919 tak maani gayi he
 There is a parable about Rammohun Rai that can be read as a metaphor for his personality
 kaha jaataa he ki unke do ghar the
 In terms of food, clothing and living, one used to live like a Victorian Gentileman and the other like a traditional Bengali Brahmin
 darasal, unke vyaktitv or krititv kii sabase badi visheshta thi purv or pashchim kaa sanshleshan
 However, this parable also does not define his stereotypical personality
 1820 main unki kriti ‘parasepts of jisas’ kaa prakaashan hua jisamen isa ke naitik sandesh ko isai tatvagyan or chamatkaar kathaon se alag karke pesh kiya gaya tha
 The Christian clergy class in Bengal was angered by his efforts
 uske virodh ke parinamswaroop rammohan raay ne isai janata ke naam teen apilen jari karke apane vichaaron ko or spashtataa pradaan kii
 Along with this, he also tried to highlight the ideological continuity of Hindu theism from the Vedas by publishing the Brahmanical magazine
 rammohan ne apane dharmik vichaaron ko dharti par utaarne ke liye 20 agast 1828 ko ‘brahm sabha’ kaa gathan kiya
 This process resulted in the establishment of a church in 1830 and the Brahmo Samaj movement began which continued to influence the consciousness of Bengali society for a long time
 1818 se 1829 ke bich rammohan raay ne sati pratha jaisi buraai par akraman karte hue teen rachanaayen prakashit kin
 His efforts are credited for creating public opinion against the practice of Sati and persuading the British to ban it
 rammohan ne aadhunik shiksha or vishesh taur se stri shiksha ke prasar main agua bhoomika nibhaai
 He is also called the creator of Bangla prose
 bengal rinesaan ke is daur main rammohan ke prayaason ko dohare virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the one hand he was opposed by anti-reform traditional writers and scholars like Radhakant Deb, Gaurikant Bhattacharya and Bhavani Charan Banerjee, while he also faced criticism from the French Revolution and English Radicalism which was led by 'young Bengal' and its anglo-indin The leader was in the hands of Henry Vivian Derozio
 yah alag baat he ki derozio ke anuyaayi apane kaamon or vaktrutaaon se samaaj ko chaunkaane ke alaava koi sthai asar nahin daal paye
 However, the soft program of social reforms based on Rammohan's tradition continued even after his death
 uski kaman devendranath thakur or akshay kumaar dutt ke haathon main thi
 Meanwhile, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar campaigned against child marriage and polygamy
 haalaanki yang bengal andolan 1842 main vidhwaa vivaah ke paksh main awaz uthaa chukaa tha, par vidyasagar ke prayaason se hi ise lokapriy andolan kaa rup mila
 The renaissance of Bengal after the Revolt of 1857 entered the literary revolution and through it the era of nationalist thought

 1865 main bankim chandra chatarji kaa surya unke pehle aitihaasik upanyaas durgeshnandini ke saath bengali saanskrithik kshitij par uga
 In 1873 he started the tradition of social novels through poisoning
 1879 main ‘samya’ sheershak se niabandh likh kar bankim ne samtamulakata or utopian samaajwaad ke prati rujhaan dikhaaya, par 1882 main aanandamath likh kar ve deshbhaktipurna punarutthanavaad kii lahar main bah gayi
 The song 'vande Mataram' recorded in the same composition is one of the three national anthems of India
 saahitiyik unmesh ke saath- saath bengali navajagaran ne itihaas lekhan or samaaj-vigyaan ke anya kshetron main yogadan kii parampara kaa sutarapaat bhi kiya
 This period was particularly eventful in terms of religious reforms and revivalism
 ek taraf to keshav chandra sen ke netritv main yuva brahm samaji sudhaar andolan kii alakh jagaaye hue the, duusari taraf wahabi asantosh khadbada rahaa tha or nav- hinduvad kii padchaap sunaayi de rahi thi
 It was during this period that Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa of Dakshineswar declared all religious beliefs to be holy through his magnetic personality
 isai dharmantaran ko hawa dene vaala protestant ugravad isse kamazor hua or parampara ke pairokaron ko thodi raahat mili
 Swami Vivekananda, a young disciple of Paramahamsa, gained international fame from his speech delivered at the World Releases Conference in 1893 and formulated his particular style of idealistic nationalism
 chaar saal tak pashchim kaa daura karke laute to 1897 main unka rashtriya nayak kii tarah swaagat kiya gaya
 The period after 1861 was something in which the most favorite word of Bengali intellectual society became 'rashtriya'
 rajanarayan bose, navagopal mitra, jyotirindranath thakur or bhoodev mukherjee kii aguai main kai tarah kii gatividhiyaan chalin jinamein hindu meley kaa aayojan ullekhneey tha jo kareeb das saal tak kolkata ko aalodit karata rahaa
 The period after 1870 was a period of political movements in which the leadership of Surendranath Banerjee emerged who was known as the 'king of the Desolate of Bengal'
 surendranath ke jujharupan kaaran ke kaaran angrez unka naam bigaad kar ‘sarender note’ banerjee bhi kehete the
 In 1876, Banerjee founded the 'indin Association' whose 1883 national conference gave rise to the idea of creating a national organization for all Indians
 iskaa parinaam 1885 main bhartiya rashtriya congress kii aitihaasik sthapana ke rup main niklaa

 Gilgamesh, the name of the ancient Sumeri Veerakavya and its hero
 gilgamesh us kavy main jalpralay kii katha manu or nuh ke agravarti apane purvaj jiusuddu ke mukh main sunata he ki kis prakaar usne pralay ke avasar par jeevon ke jode apni naukaaon main ekatra kar unki raksha kii thi
 That story of the Sumerian Babuli tradition is written in the seventh century BC in the Gilgamesh epic, written on wet bricks in Sumeri Kilnuma letters
 The Asura Emperor Asura is from the Nineveh Museum in Banipal
 jalpralay kii katha kaa nayak gilgamesh kaa purvaj jiusuddu he par virakavy kaa nayak swayan gilgamesh he
 Scholars believe that the deluge 3200 BC And was first mentioned by Nur Ninsubur in 1984 BC
 k was almost done
 gilgamesh, sansar kaa pracheenatam virakavy hone ke atirikt, maanav jati kii sambhavat: pratham pustak he
 In it, the accounts of the heroic works of the ancient king of Uruk named Gilgamesh are preserved
 us parampara se gyaat hota he ki gilgamesh ne uruuk par kai saal tak gheraa daalkar use jeeta tha
 After that he began to rule there autocraticly and then the gods were obliged to send a half-human half-animal named Anki-du for his destruction
 gilgamesh ne usko jeetne ke liye ek aakarshak nari bheji jisane apane kal chal se use jeet liya
 Impressed by the woman, he came to the court of Gilgamesh and the two became friends
 phir donon ne ek saath anek nagaron kii vijay kii or ek bhayanak daitya kii khoj main registan, behad or jangal paar karte hue ve uttar pashchim gaye jahaan us daitya kaa sanhaar kar unhone uskaa garh jeet liya
 This heroic poem of Gilgamesh is one of the sweetest, most beautiful and popular among the ancient Babuli stories and literary works, so much so that poetry became prevalent in places where the Kilnuma script was preached
 iskaa pracheenatam sumeri paath abhaagyavash tuuti sthiti main miltaa he parantu uske anek pashchaatkaaleen sanskarnon ko milakar dow campbell-tamson ne jo uskaa samoochaa paath prastut kiya he vah neeche diya ja rahaa he
 Gilgamesh Veerakavya is found written on 12 plaques or bricks
 pehali eent par katha kaa aarambh hota he jisamen gilgamesh ardh pishaach ardh manus pita or devi ninsun mata se utpann hokar apni praja ko nirankush shashan dwaara peedit karata he
 The subjects of his Uruk then pray to the gods for protection and the gods send a wonderful creature called Anki-do to kill Gilgamesh
 pehle vah vanya pashuon ke bich aata he or unheen main ramata he, yadhyapi unki tarah kaa vah nahin he
 Till the desert of Aheri, Gilgamesh complains about his terrible form, complaining that Enki-do frees the creatures when they catch the animal
 tab gilgamesh uske paas ek devdasi bhejtaa he jo apane haavbhaav dwaara use rijhaakar apane vash main kar leti he
 The second brick lesson is that Enki-du teaches Devadasi bread to eat and drink Sura and to make it civilized she takes him to the court of Gilgamesh where the two first fight a duel then are influenced by each other's power, sources of mutual friendship
 i get tied up
 teesri eent ke vrittant ke anusaar donon mitra syria yaa levnan kii ore ghaney jangalon ke akraman ko jate hai
 a terrible monster named Huavaa protects the forest of cedars, whose thunder is like a storm, whose mouth is like flames and whose breath is like breath
 anki-du us bheeshan daitya kii baat sunakar dar jaataa he par gilgamesh use utsahit karata he or uruuk ke vayovridhon kii chetavanee kii parvaah na kar donon daitya kii khoj main nikal padate hai
 The fourth brick accounts of the cedars facing their path to the forest, and in the fifth, Gilgamesh is beset by many dreams, interpreted by the demise of the Enki-do demon Huwawa
 gilgamesh par krupa kar tab surya daitya ke viruddh apane aath pawan bhejtaa he or gilgamesh ant main daitya kaa sir kaat letaa he
 According to the Sixth Brick, both victorious heroes return to Uruk
 devi ininna ab gilgamesh ke prati apana prem vyakt karti he par vah uske purvapremiyon ke naash kii katha kii ore sanket kar uskaa pranay asweekaar kar detaa he
 Then the goddess furiously prays to her father, God An, for the destruction of Gilgamesh, meaning the creation of the divine bull
 devtaa saand siraj detaa he jiske gilgamesh ke nagar main aane se nagarikon par traas chaa jaataa he
 In the end, Enki-du catches his horn and slams him, then the two friends kill him and cut his horn and hang it in the temple of Lugalbanda
 is mahaan krity ke uplakshya main ek asaadhaaran bhoj kaa ayejan hota he par raat anki-du ke liye bhayanak sapanom se bhari hoti he
 According to the Seventh Brick, Anki-du sees in his dream that the gods decide to kill him as a result of the bull slaughter, and Enki-du wakes up and curses his fate as to why he is sent by Gilgamesh in an affair with Ramani Trapped, why did he leave the happy life of the plain desert and enter the world of human danger? Then after the Suryadev is condemned, he blesses the woman
 aathvin eent ke vrittant main gilgamesh apane maranasann mitra kaa parithosh karata he
 But the power of anki-du decreases continuously and gradually its life disappears
 gilgamesh tab uski mrityu par vilaap karata he or use mitti se dhakkar dafna detaa he
 One day Gilgamesh himself is suddenly scared of death in his relationship and he goes in search of his ancestor Jiusudu, the heroic hero of the deluge, to take away the secret of immortality from him
 naveen eent ke vrittant main uski isi yatra kaa varnan he
 He meets the Goddess residing in the depths of the sea after completing the journey of horrific mountains protected by many creatures, according to which he describes his previous journey according to the tenth brick
 devi amarta kii uski khoj kii baat sun use ghar laut jane or maanav kaa apekshit jivan vyateet karne ko utsahit karti he par gilgamesh uskaa kahana na sun aage bad jaataa he or mrityu ke samudr main naav chalaane vaale navik se ja miltaa he
 Fearing the threat of breaking the boat and sail, the sailor finally crosses Gilgamesh to the deathbed and stands in front of his ancestor Giussudu
 jiusuddu use dekh vismit hota he or gilgamesh usase amarta kaa mantra poochta he
 Further, in the 11th brick story, there is a description of that deluge, that of the Veerakavya within the Veerakavaya, whose hero was done by Giussudu himself
 jiusuddu tab use sagar ke tal main ugnevaale amartadaayak oshadhi kaa bhed bataata he or gilgamesh samudr ke tal tak paith aushadhi ukhaad laata he
 The sailor then brings him back to the world of pottery and Gilgamesh stands on the banks of a pond to bathe
 snaan karte samay ek saanp oshadhi kii gandh se prabhavit ho use le bhaagta he or talab main pravesh kar apni puraani kentul chhod naveenatam dhaaran kar letaa he
 Gilgamesh then mourns this new crisis and tears roll from his eyes
 virakavy kaa vastut: yaheen ant ho jaataa he, yadhyapi ek eent, 12veen, kaa vrittant uskaa upsanhaar prastut karata he jo sambhavat: peeche joda gaya he
 According to its legend, the elderly and extremely sad Gilgamesh goes to Hades with the help of the deity Nergal to know the condition of humans after death
 vahaan vah apane mitra anki-du ke pret se miltaa he jo use pret jivan kaa rahasy samajhaata he
 It is said that after being buried in the tomb, insects eat the body like a cloth and the phantom wanders on the streets at night eating feces and drinking dirty water
 jab uske vanshaj uskaa shraadh karte hai, usko peya or aahaar dete hai tabhi vah shantipurvak rah paata he
 The end of poetry is extremely sad
 vidwaanon kaa anumaan he ki is virakavy kaa naikagilgamesh uruuk kaa aitihaasik raja tha jisane dakshini babul par 3000 i
 pus
 se kuch hi pehle raaj kiya tha, jalpralay ke kuch hi sau varsh baad
 The story of Gilgamesh poetry is Sumeri, though it was written in the Akkadi or Sami period and where the Kilnuma script was preached, it was also written in foreign languages

 After Al Fariq's called party at the base, Samsara reveals that both he and Bodhi knew Ono Ozaki since childhood, when his parents died of an avalanche accident and Ozaki made them stay

 Actually his death was not due to attempts to complete the challenge, but a large ship took his life for which he had climbed on the back of the whale to save the whale from their kill

 Kanishka I), or Kanishka the Great, was one of the greatest emperors of India of the Kushan dynasty in the second century
 vah apane sainya, rajnatik evam aadhyatmik uplabdhiyon tathaa kaushal hetu prakhyat tha
 This emperor has a special place in Indian history and history of Central Asia, being a lover of his conquests, religious tendencies, literature and art
 kushaan vansh ke sansthaapak kujul kadfices kaa hi ek vanshaj, kanishka bakhtriya se is samrajya par sattarum hua, jisaki gananaa asia ke mahanatam shaskaon main kii jaati he, kyonki iskaa samrajya tareem basin main turfan se lekar gangey maidan main patliputra tak rahaa tha jisamen madhya asia ke aadhunik uzbekistan tazakastan, china ke aadhunik sikyang evam consu praant se lekar afghanistan, pakistan or samast uttar bharat main bihar evam urisa tak aate hai
 The main capital of this empire was in the city of Purushapur in Peshawar Gandhar province
 iske alaava do anya badi rajdhaniyaan pracheen kapisha main bhi thim
 His triumphs and faith in Buddhism played a special role in the development of the silk route and the expansion of Mahayana Buddhism from Gandhara through that stretch across the Karakoram ranges to China
 pehle ke itihaasavettaon ke anusaar kanishka ne rajgaddi 78 i0 main praapt kii, evam tabhi is varsh ko shaq sanwat ke armbh kii tithi mana jaataa he
 However, according to later historians, this date is no longer considered the date of Kanishka's ruling
 inke anumananusaar kanishka ne satta 127 i0 main praapt kii thi
 Kanishka was a Kushan of the Yuzhi race
 uski sthaneey bhashaa abhi agyaat he
 In his Rabatak inscriptions, the Greek script has been used to write a language called Arya, which is a form of Bakhtri, the original language of Ariana
 yah ek madhyakaalin purvi iranian bhashaa thi
 By the way, this language must have been used by the Kushans to contact the local people
 kushaan logon ke kuleen log kis bhashaa vishesh kaa prayog karte the, ye abhi nishchit nahin he
 If the controversial things linking the Kushan and / or Yuezhi peoples with the Agni Kuchi people of the Tarim Basin were correct, then the language of the Torcherians - a Chantom indo-european language - would have been spoken by Kanishka
 kanishka vim kadfices kaa uttaradhikari tha, jaisaa rabatak shilalekhon main kushaan raajaaon kii prabhaavshaalee vanshavali dwaara drishy he
 The relationship of Kanishka to other Kushan kings is mentioned in the Rabatak inscriptions, from which the lineage up to the time of Kanishka is known
 uske prapitamah kujul kadfices the, vimaa taktu uske pitamah the
 Kanishka's father was Vim Kadphises, who later came to Kanishka himself
 kanishka kaa samrajya nissandeh vishaal tha
 It extended from southern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north of Amu Darya, located in the northwest direction from Pakistan and India to Mathura in the southeast
 rabatak shilalekhon ke anusaar yah patliputra evam shrichampa tak vistrut tha
 Kashmir in north India was also under Kanishka, where a town called Kanishka was settled near Baramulla Pass
 yahan se ek bahut bade stupa kaa aadhaar praapt hua he
 Knowledge of Kanishka's dominance over Central Asia is still limited
 book of da letters haan, hau hanshu, se gyaat hota he ki, chini general baan chaao ne 90 i main khotaan ke nikat kanishka kii 70,000 sainikon kii sena se yuddh kiya, jiskaa netritva kushan senadhipati zai ne kiya tha
 Although Ban Chao claimed to be victorious and at the same time repelled the army of the Kushans under the Scorched Earth Policy, the region remained under the Kushans by the beginning of the second century
 parinamswaroop, yah kshetra kushanon kaa samrajya kuch samay ke liye kashgaar, khotaan evam yaarakanda tak bhi vistrut hua, jo ki pehle tareem basin ke chini kshetra rahe the
 Many coins from the time of Kanishka have been found in the Tarim Basin
 dakshin asia evam rome ke bich bhoomi path tathaa samudri maarg, donon par hi adhikaar banaaye rakhana, kanishka kaa mukhya lakshya rahaa tha
 Kanishka's postures bear the markings of the Indian Hindu, Greek, Iranian and Sumerian goddesses, indicating his religious tolerance
 uske dwaara shashan ke aarmabhik varshon main chalaaye gaye sikkon main unani lipi va bhashaa kaa prayog hua he tathaa unani daivi chitra ankit mili
 Later period coins show Iranian gods in Bactrian, Iranian script and languages, which he used to speak, and Greek gods
 sabhi kanishka ke sikkon main, yaham tak ki un sikkon main bhi jo bactrian main likhe hai, ek sanshodhit unani lipi main likhe gayi the, jinamein ek atirikt utkeern akshar he, jo 'kushaaan' evam 'kanishak' main prayukt / š / darshata he
 In the coin of Emperor Kanishka, Suryadeva stands to the left
 baane haath main dand he jo rashna sein bandhaa he
 The sword hangs around the waist
 surya irani rajasi veshbhusha main ek lambe kot pahane daadi vaale dikhaaye gaye hai, jiske kandhon se jwaalaayein nikalati hai
 He wears large circular shoes
 use praayah vedi par aahuti yaa bali dete hue dikhaaya jaataa he
 Kanishka resembling this description was preserved in the Kabul Museum, but was later destroyed by the Taliban
 kanishka ke kaal ke armbh ke kuch sikkon par unani bhashaa evam lipi main likhaa he : ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΚΑΝΗϷΚΟΥ, basalius baseleon kaneshkou "kanishka ke sikke, raajaaon kaa raja" in aarmabhik mudraon main unani naam likhe jate the: Along with the arrival of the Bactrian language on the currencies, the Iranian and Indic gods took the place of the Greek gods on them: bahut kam kintu kuch buddha devataaon kaa ankan kiya gaya: Apart from these, some Hindu deities are also marked: kanishka buddha dharm main atyant mahatvapurn sthaan par pratishthit he, kyonki vah na keval buddha dharm main vishwaas rakhata tha varan uski shikshaaon ke prachaar evam prasar ko bhi bahut protsaahan diya
 An example of this is that he organized the fourth Buddhist organization in Kashmir, which was presided over by Vasumitra and Ashwaghosh
 isi parishad main buddha dharm do maton main vibhajit ho gayi – hinayan evam mahayan
 At the same time, a picture of Buddha with 22 physical symbols was also made
 usne unani-buddha kala kii pratinidhitiv vaali gandhar kala ko bhi utana hi protsaahan diya jitna hindu kala ke pratinidhitiv vaali mathura kala ko diya
 Kanishka had personally adopted both Buddhist and Persian features, but had some inclination towards Buddhism
 kushaan samrajya kii vibhinn pustako me varnit buddha shikshaaon evam prarthana style ke madhyam se kanishka ke buddha dharm ke prati jhukaav kaa pataa chalata he
 Kanishka's greatest contribution to Buddhist architecture was the Buddhist stupa of Peshawar
 jin puraatatvavettaon ne iske aadhaar ko 1908-1909 main khoja, unhone bataaya ki is stupa kaa vyas 286 fit tha
 Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang has written that the height of this stupa was 600 to 700 "feet" and it was studded with precious gems
 nishchit rup se ye vishaal atyant sundar imaarat pracheen kaal ke aashcharyon main rahi hogi
 Kanishka is said to be very close to the Buddhist scribe Ashwaghosh
 yahi baad ke varshon main unke dharmik paramarshdaata rahe the
 During the reign of Kanishka and when the first Suvarna Mudra of the Kushan dynasty was introduced, the king's spiritual help was asaf
 kanishka kaal kii buddha mudraaen anya mudraon kii tulana main kaafii kam thim 
 In many postures, Kanishka was shown standing in front and Buddha in Greek style
 kuch mudraon main shakyamuni buddha evam maitrey ko bhi dikhaaya gaya he
 Like all Kanishka coins; Their size and design were rough, rough and proportion deteriorated
 buddha kii akruti halki si bigadi hui, bade aakaar ke kaanon vaali tathaa donon pair kanishka kii bhaanti hi failaaye hue, unani style kii nakal main dikhaaye gaye hai
 Three types of Buddhist coins of Kanishka are found: kushaan ke buddha ankan vaale maatr chah swarna sikke hai, inamen se bhi chatha ek pracheen aabhushan kaa madhya bhaag main jadaa hua bhaag tha, jisamen kanishka buddha ankit hai, tathaa hridayakar maanikyon ke gole se susajjit he
 All such coins of the Kanishka period are minted in gold; And two are found in different denominations: one dinar of about 8 grams, roughly resembling Roman oras, and one fourth dinar, about 2 grams, which is about equal to one obol
 ) The Buddha is depicted wearing monks such as attire, attire, attire, and overcoat like overcoat
 unke kaan atyadhik bade va lambe dikhaaye gaye he, jo kisi mudra main pratikatmak rup se atishyokt hai, kintu baad ke kai gandhar kii murtiyon main bhi dikhaaya gaya he
 a hair piece is also built on his crest
 aisa gandhar ke baad ke bahut se shilpon main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Thus one can say that his form is highly symbolized in the Buddha coins, which is different from the earlier Gandhara sculptures
 ye gandhar shilp buddha apekshaakrit adhik prakritik dikhaai dete the
 His mustache has also been shown in many postures

 According to the Bhavishya Purana, Samva and Varaha Purana, Lord Krishna's son Samb had established the first Sun Temple in Multan

 In addition to the Jagaswamy temple of Bhinmal, Kanishka also built a lake called 'karada' there

 It is said that the present day residents of Bhinmal, Deora / Deora people and Shrimali Brahmins came from Kanak as well as from Kashmir
 devda / devra, logon kaa yah naam isliye padaa kyonki unhone jagaswami surya mandir banaaya tha
 Being associated with King Kanaka, it would not be wrong to associate him with the title Devaputra of Emperor Kanishka

 It is also noteworthy here that a Kanigham has identified the Kushans with modern Gurjars in the Archeological Survey Report 1864 and has assumed that the people of Kasana Gautra of Gurjars are the present representatives of the Kushans

 naatak, kavy kaa ek rup he
 The composition which makes the sensation in the heart of the audience not only by hearing but also by sight, is called drama or visual poetry
 naatak main shravy kavy se adhik romaniyata hoti he
 Being audible, it is more closely related to folk consciousness
 naatyashaastra main lok chetana ko naatak ke lekhan or manchan kii mul prerana mana gaya he
 The play is counted in poems
 kavy do prakaar ke maane gayi hai— shravy or drishy
 a distinction of this visual poetry has been considered drama
 par drushti dwaara mukhya rup se iskaa grahan hone ke kaaran drishy kavy maatr ko naatak kehane lage hai
 The Natyashastra of Bharatamuni is the most ancient book on this subject
 agnipurana main bhi naatak ke lakshan aadi kaa nirupan he
 In it, the name of one type of poetry is called Prakarna
 is prakeern ke do bhed he— kavy or abhinaeya
 The Agnipuran states 27 distinctions of visual poetry or metaphor
 sahityadarpan main naatak ke lakshan, bhed aadi adhik spasht rup se die hai
 It has been written above that a distinction of visual poetry is called drama
 drishy kavy ke mukhya do vibhaag hai— roopak or uparupak
 There are ten distinctions of metaphor - metaphor, drama, episode, speech, vyayoga, samvakara, dhim, ehamraig, ankavithi, and farce
 'uparupak' ke atharah bhed hai— naatika, trotak, goshtee, sattak, natayaraasak, prasthaan, ullapya, kavy, prekshna, raasak, sanlapak, srigadith, shinpak, vilasika, durmallika, prakaranika, hallisha or bhanika
 According to the above distinctions, the term drama speaks in the sense of visual poetry
 sahityadarpan ke anusaar naatak kisi khyath vrutt ' kii lekar likhaanaa chahie
 It should be full of many luxuries, pleasures, sorrows, and many juices
 usamen paanch se lekar das tak ank hone chahie
 The protagonist of the play must be a majestic man or Rajarshi of Dhirodatta and eminent dynasty
 naatak ke pradhan yaa angi ras shringaar or vir hai
 The remaining juices are secondary
 shanti, karunaa aadi jis rupak main main prathan ho vah naatak nahin kahala saktaa
 There must be an astonishing trade in the treaty
 upsanhaar main mangal hi dikhaaya janaa chahie
 The break drama is against the Sanskrit Alankar Shastra
 abhinay aarambh hone ke pehle jo kriya hoti he, use purvarang kehete hai
 After the puvarang, the chieftain nut or sutradhara, also known as the founder, comes and praises the gathering, then the nuts, nati sutradhars, etc
 have an interactive conversation in which the subject of the play being played, poet-lineage narration etc
 are covered
 naatak ke is ansh ko prastaavna kehete hai
 The chronicle with which the play is composed is called the object
 'vastu' do prakaar kii hoti he—aadhikarik vastu or praasangik vastu
 The one who is the main hero of all the chronicles is called 'adhikari'
 is adhikari ke sambandh main jo kuch varnan kiya jaataa he use 'aadhikarik vastu kehete hai; jaise, ramlila main ram kaa charitra
 For the benevolence of this officer or with reference to rasupati, whose description comes, it is called a relevant thing; Such as the character of Sugriva, etc
 'saamne laane' arthath drishy sanmukh upasthit karne ko abhinay kehete hai
 Therefore, the name of Avasthanuparupa or Swang is acting
 abhinay chaar prakaar kaa hota he— angik, vaachik, aharya or satvik
 The act that is done with the gesture of the organs is done with the help of words, what is done with the words of speech, what is done by making disguises, what is done by the vibrations of the food and emotions, by the vibrations, sweat, etc
 is called satvik
 naatak main beej, bindu, pataakaa, prakari or kaary in paanchon ke dwaara prayojan siddhi hoti he
 Whatever is said around the mouth and the first reason for success is called seed, as Yudhishthira's zeal for Bhima's anger in the epic drama is the seed because of Draupadi's capitation
 koi ek baat puri hone par duusare vaakya se uskaa sambandh na rahane par bhi usamen aise vaakya laana jinaki duusare vaakya ke saath asangati na ho 'bindu' he
 The description of a wider context in the middle is called pataka - such as Sugriva in Uttaracharita and Abhigyan - the characterization of clown in Shankutal
 ek desh vyapee charitravarnan ko prakari kehete hai
 Whatever is done for the success of the action initiated is called action; Like, Ravana slaughter in Ramlila
 kisi ek vishay kii charchaa ho rahi ho, isi bich main koi doosraa vishay upasthit hokar pehle vishay se mail main maaloom ho vahaan pataakaa sthaan hota he, jaise, ramcharit main ram sita se kah rahe hai—'he priye ! tumhaari koi baat mujhe asay nahin, yadi asay he to keval tumhaara virah, isi bich main pratihaari aakar kahata he : dev ! durmukh upasthit
 Here, with the word 'present', 'virah present' looks like this and a kind of miracle appears
 sanskrit sahitya main naatak sambandhi aise hi anek kaushalon kii udbhaavna kii gai he or anek prakaar ke vibhed dikhaae gaye hai
 Nowadays, the new plays which are written in the national languages, following all the rules of Sanskrit plays or inclusion of subjects is considered unnecessary
 bhaaratendu harishchandra likhte hai—'sanskrit naatak kii bhanti hindi naatak main unka anusandhan karnaa yaa kisi naatakang main inako ytnpurvak rakhkar naatak likhnaa vyarth he; kyonki pracheen lakshan rakhkar aadhunik naatakadi kii shobhaa sampadan karne se ulta fal hota he or ytn vyarth ho jaataa he
 Acting and theater in India was produced during the Vedic period itself
 tatpashchaat sanskrit rangamanch to apni unnati kii paraakaashtha par pahunch gaya tha-bharat muni kaa naatyashaastra iskaa pramaan he
 In very ancient times, Sanskrit dramas in India were no longer the language of religious occasions, cultural festivals, social ceremonies and state speech, so the staging of Sanskrit plays ended
 bharatvarsh main naatakon kaa prachaar bahut pracheen kaal se hai
 The drama of Bharata Muni is very old
 ramayana, mahabharat, harivansh ityadi main nat or naatak kaa ullekh he
 Panini has taken the names of two Natasutraks named ‘shilali’ and ‘krishashva’
 shilaali kaa naam shukla yajurvedic shatapath brahman or samavedic anupad sutara main miltaa hai
 According to astrology, scholars have told the Shatapatha Brahmin above 4000 years
 atah kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon kii yah raay haq greece yaa yunaan main hi sabase pehle naatak kaa pradurbhaav hua, thik nahin he
 It is written in Harivansh that when Pradyumna, Samb Adi Yadav went to Prince Vajranabha's purse, he played the Ram Janmabha and the Rambhabhisar plays there
 pehle unhone nepathy bandha tha jiske bheetar se striyon ne madhur swar se gaan kiya tha
 Yadav named Shur was made Ravan, a woman named Manvoti became Rambha, Pradyumna Nalakubar and Samb were made clowns
 wilson aadi paashchaatya vidwaanon ne spasht sweekaar kiya hai ki hinduon ne apane yahan naatak kaa pradurbhaav apane aap kiya tha
 The ancient Hindu kings used to build large colorants
 madhyapradesh main sarguja ek pahari sthaan he, vahaan ek gupha ke bheetar is prakaar kii ek rangashaala ke chihn paae gaye hai
 It is true that Sanskrit dramas are not available nowadays before the arrival of the Greeks, but their absence from this fact cannot be considered, given this much evidence
 sambhav he, kalasampann unani jati se jab hindu jati kaa milan hua ho tab jis prakaar kuch or or baaten ek ne duusare kii grahan kii
 Similarly, some things in relation to the drama must have been taken by Hindus
 bahyapati kaa 'jawanika' naam dekh kuch log yavan sansarg suchit karte hai
 From the 'visual' Sanskrit plays in the numerals, it is estimated that the pictures used to remain on these tracks
 astu adhik se adhik is vishay main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki atyant pracheen kaal main jo abhinay hua karte the
 Paintings were not used in them
 sikandar ke aane ke peeche unka prachaar hua
 Even now Ramlila, Raslila are without screens
 madhyakaal main pradeshik bhashaaon main loktantr kaa udai hua
 It is a strange coincidence that in the Muslim period, where the religious fanatics of the rulers broke the literary tradition of India, there was a good spread of Lok Manch in the local languages
 raasalila, ramlila tathaa nautanki aadi ke rup main lokdharmee natyamanch bana rahaa
 In the Bhaktikal, on one hand, Krishna's Rasleela was widely practiced in Braj Bhasha and on the other, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, Ramlila started celebrating with great pomp in small towns across India
 saahitiyik drushti se is madhyakaal main kuch sanskrit naatakon ke padhyabaddh hindi chhayanuwaad bhi hue, jaise nevaaj krit ‘abhigyaan shaakuntal’, somnath krit ‘malti-madhav’, hridayramcharita ‘hanumannatak’ aadi; kuch moulik padhyabaddh sanvadatmak rachanaayen bhi huin, jaise lachhiraam krit ‘karunaabharan’, raghuram nagar krit ‘sabhasaar’, ganesh kavi krit ‘pradhyumnvijay’ aadi; par inamen naatakeey paddati kaa purnataya nirvaah nahin hua
 These can only be called interactive compositions
 is prakaar saahitiyik drushti tathaa saahitiyik rachanaaon ke abhaav ke kaaran madhyakaal main saahitiyik rangakarm kii ore koi pravriti nahin hui
 The truth is that before the rise of commercial and literary theater in the modern period, the folk theater of Ramlila, Nautanki etc
 kept the Hindi theater alive for four-five hundred years
 yah lokmanch-parampara aaj tak vibhinn roopon main samooche desh main vartmaan he
 Apart from Ramlila in North India, 'veer Abhimanyu', 'satya Harishchandra' etc
 dramas based on Mahabharata and 'roop-basant', 'heer-ranjha', 'haqikatarai', 'bilvamangal' etc
 are popular till date
 aadhunik kaal main angreji rajya kii sthapana ke saath rangamanch ko protsaahan mila
 As a result, commercial drama circles were established all over India
 natyarangan kii pravriti sarvapratham banglaa main dikhaai di
 Around 1835 AD, many unofficial theater in Calcutta were built
 kalakatta ke kuch sambhrant pariwaron or raison ne inke nirmaan main yoga diya tha or duusari ore vyavayayik naatak mandaliyon ke asaahitiyik prayaas se alag tha
 The study of this drama-creation of Bengali and the Natyarangan is important because the condition, direction and inspiration of Bharatendu Harishchandra's Rangandolan was derived from it
 banglaa ke is aarmabhik saahitiyik prayaas main jo naatak rache gaye ve mul sanskrit yaa angreji naatakon ke chhayanuwaad yaa roopaantar the
 It is clear that Bharatendu's initial effort was also in the shadow of Sanskrit plays
 hindi rangamanchi saahitiyik naatakon main sabase pehla hindi geetinaty amaanat krit ‘inder sabha’ kaha ja saktaa he jo san 1853 i
 main lakhanu ke nawab waajid alishaah ke darbar main khelaa gaya tha
 The Urdu-style experiment in it was similar to that adopted by Parsi drama circles in their plays
 san 1862 i
 main kaashi main ‘janaki mangal’ naamak vishuddh hindi naatak khelaa gaya tha
 The Parsi circles — Original Victoria, Empress Victoria, Elphinstone Theatrical Company, Alfred Theatrical and New Alfred Company, etc
 — went far beyond the above-mentioned efforts of the aforementioned literary theater
 sarvapratham bombai or baad main hyderabad, lakhanu, banaras, dilli lahore aadi kai kendron or sthanon se ye companiyaan desh-bhar main gum-ghumkar hindi naatakon kaa pradarshan karne lageen
 For these Parsi drama circles, writers like Nasrabani Khan Sahab, Raunak Banarsi, Vinayak Prasad 'talib', 'ahsan' etc
 first wrote plays
 janata kaa sasta manoranjan or dhanoparjan hi in companiyon kaa mukhya uddeshy tha
 That is why they did not have special purpose from high-quality literary plays
 dharmik-puranic tathaa prem-pradhan naatakon ko hi ye apane rangamanch par dikhaati thim
 He did not hesitate to perform cheap and vulgar
 isi se janata kii ruchi bhrasht karne kaa dosha in par lagaaya jaataa he
 Due to the excursion, the theater of these companies also used to roam with them
 kisi sthaayee rangamanch kii sthapana inke dwaara bhi sambhav nahin thi
 The structure of the theater was constructed by bullies and picture-bizarre curtains were hung on the stage
 bhadkeeli-chatakili veshbhusha, pardon kii nai-nai chitrakaari tathaa chamatkaarpurn drishy-vidhaan kii ore inkaa adhik dhyaan rahata tha
 The curtains were raised according to the scenery
 sangeet-vaadya kaa aayojan stage ke agle bhaag main hota tha
 The crass comical scenes were deliberately placed in between the scenes
 bich-bich main shaayari, gajalen or tukbandi khub chalati thi
 The language was a mixed form of urdu-hindi
 samvaad padya-rup tathaa tukpurna khub hote the
 There have also been some playwrights such as Radheshyam Kathachakak, Narayan Prasad Betab, Agahashr Kashmiri, Harikrishna Johar etc
 who have tried to improve the Parsi theater by giving it some literary elements and tried to bring Hindi to this commercial theater
 par vyavsaayik vritti ke kaaran sambhavat: is rangamanch par sudhaar sambhav nahin tha
 With this, these playwrights also had to become commercial
 is prakaar parsi rangamanch na viksit ho sakaa, na sthaayee hi ban sakaa
 Plays in Hindi are thought to begin with Bharatendu Harishchandra
 us kaal ke bharatendu tathaa unke samakaleen naatakakaron ne lok chetana ke vikaas ke liye naatakon kii rachana kii isliye us samay kii saamaajik samasyaon ko naatakon main abhivyakt hone kaa acha avasar mila
 As has been said, the creation of non-commercial literary theater in Hindi can be considered from the geographical metaphor called 'inder Sabha' of 'amanat' Lakhanvi
 par sach to yah he ki ‘inder sabha’ kii vastav main rangamanchi kriti nahin thi
 It used to have an open stage under the canopy
 nautanki kii tarah teen ore darshak baithte the, ek ore takht par raja inder kaa asana laga diya jaataa tha, saath main pariyon ke liye kursiyaan rakhi jaati thim
 a scarlet curtain was hung behind the decorations
 isi ke peeche se paatro kaa pravesh karaayaa jaataa tha
 King Inder, fairies etc
 characters once came and were present there
 ve apane samvaad bolkar waapas nahin jate the
 At that time, Natyarangan became so popular that many meetings were organized following the 'inder Sabha' of Amanat, such as 'madarilal's Inder Sabha', 'daryai Inder Sabha', 'hawaiian Inder Sabha' etc
 parsi naatak mandaliyon ne bhi in sabhaaon or majaliseparistaan ko apanaaya
 These compositions were not plays, nor did they form the theater of Hindi
 isi se bharatendu harishchandr inako 'naatakabhas' kehete the
 He wrote 'bandar Sabha' as his parody
 sanskrit naatakon kaa yug dhalane laga tab chaudaavin shatabdi se unnisvi shatabdi tak unka sthaan vibhinn bhartiya bhashaaon main lok naatakon ne liya

 According to this theorem, the value f { \ displaystyle f} of the remaining r { \ displaystyle r \ ,} when dividing a polynomial f { \ displaystyle f \ ,} from a linear divisor x - a { \ displaystyle xa \ ,}
 Is equal to mana f = x 3 − 12 x 2 − 42 { \ displaystyle f=x^{3}-12x^{2}-42 \ ,} 
 Divide the polynomial by x - 3 { \ displaystyle x - 3 \ ,} x 2 − 9 x − 27 { \ displaystyle x^{2}-9x-27 \ ,} tathaa shesh − 123 { \ displaystyle -123 \ ,} praapt hota he
 And on the other hand, f = - 123 { \ displaystyle f = -123 \ ,}
 So the remainder when f is divided by = f = -123

 Hazrat Umar ibn al-khatab, E
 Muhammad Saheb's chief was among the four Sahaba
 vah hazarat abu bakr ke baad musalamaanon ke duusare khalipha chune gayi
 Muhammad was named as Farooq
 jiskaa arth satya or asaty main fark karne vaala
 His status among the followers of Muhammad sahab comes after Hazrat Abu Bakr
 umr khulpha-e-raashidin main duusare calipha chune gaye
 Omar proved to be the most successful caliph in the khulafa-e-rashidin
 musalmaan inako faruk-e-aazam tathaa amirul muminin bhi kehete hai
 European writers have written many books about him and given the title of Omar Mahan
 prasiddh lekhak maaikel ech
 heart ne apni prasiddh pustak di handred The 100: a Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, main hazarat umr ko shaamil kiya he
 Hazrat Umar was born in Mecca
 ye kurash khandaan se the
 i had learned to read writing in the days of ignorance, which in those days, the Arabs considered reading writing to be a useless task
 inkaa qad bahut ooncha, raubadaar cheharaa or gathila sharir tha
 Umar was one of the famous wrestlers of Mecca, who had a great influence in Mecca
 umr salanaa pahalwani ke muqablon main hissaa lete the
 Initially, Hazrat Umar was a staunch enemy of Islam
 or mohammad sahab ko jaan se maarna chaahate the
 Omar initially used to do fetishism
 umr makka main ek samrudgh parivaar se the, bahut bahadur tathaa diler vyakit the
 Omar did not like Muslims, nor did Muhammad's mission
 parantu paigambar muhammd sahab ek shaam kaabe ke paas jaakar allaah se dua kiya ki allaah umr ko yaa amr abu jahal donon main se jo tujko priy ho hidaayat de
 This prayer was accepted in favor of Omar
 umr ek baar paigambar ke katl ke iraade se nikle the, raste main naeem naam kaa ek shaks mila jisane umr ko bataaya ki unki bahan tathaa unke pati islam laa chuke hai
 Omar got angry and went to the sister's house
 vah donon ghar par kuran pard rahe the
 Umar started asking for the Quran but he refused
 umr krodhit hokar un donon ko maarane lage
 But his sister said we will die but will not leave Islam
 bahan ke chehre se khun tapakataa dekhakar umr ko shame aayi tathaa galati kaa ahsaas hua
 Said that i want to read the Quran, promised not to humiliate it
 jab umr ne kuran padhaa do bole yaqinan ye ishwar kii vaani he kisi manushya kii rachana nahin ho sakati
 In a miracle, Omar accepted the truth of the Quran and went to meet Muhammad
 mohammad sahab ko bahut prasannataa hui jab umr islam main daakhil ho gayi
 Muslims ran a wave of happiness over Omar's bringing Islam
 umr ne elaan kiya ki ab sab milke namaaz kaabe main padhenge jo ki pehle koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha
 Omar was an enemy of Islam but now he became the protector of Islam
 umr ko islam main dekhakar mohammad sahab ke shatruvon main koharaam much gaya
 Now Islam had got a sharp sword named Umar which made all Mecca tremble
 makka waalon ne kamazor musalamaanon par sitam tej kar diye jisko dekhakar mohammad sahab ne allaah se dua kii to allaah ne madeene jane kaa hukum diya
 All the Muslims started hiding in Hijrat i
e
 towards Madinah
 magar umr bade diler the apni talwaar lee dhanush baan liya, kaaba ke paas pahunch kar tawaaf kiya, do rachaat namaaz padhi phir kaha "jo apni maan ko apane par rulaanaa chahta he, apane bacchon ko anaath tathaa apni patni ko vidhwaa bananaa chahta he is jagah mili
 "nobody dared to stop Omar
 umr ne elaan karke hizrat kii
 Medina had become a new center of Islam
 san hijri islaami calendar kaa nirmaan kiya jo islam kaa panchang kehalaata he
 In 624 AD, Muslims had to fight the battle of Badr, in which Hazrat Umar also played an important role
 badr kii jang main musalamaanon kii fatah hui tathaa makka ke musharikon kii haar hui
 a year after the battle of Badr, the Meccans came together to attack Madina, the battle took place near a hill called Uhud
 jang ke shuru main muslim sena baari padi lekin kuch kaarnon vash muslimon kii haar hui
 Some people sparked the rumor that many Muslims were frightened if Muhammad Sahib was martyred, Omar also threw a sword and started saying that it is useless to live now
 kuch derbar pataa chalaa kii ye ek afvaah he to dubaara khadey hue
 After this, they lived together in Khandak's war
 umr ne muslim sena kaa netratv kiya ant main makka bhi fatah ho gaya
 Even after this, many battles had to be faced, Omar led an eye in all those wars
 8 june san 632 ko mohammad sahab duniya ko alavida kah gayi
 Omar and some people did not believe that Muhammad could also have death
 ye khabar sunakar umr apane hosh kho baithe, apni talwaar nikaal lee tathaa jor-jor se kehane lage ki jisane kaha ki nabi kii maut ho gai he main uskaa sar tan se juda kar duungaa
 On this delicate occasion, then Hazrat Abu Bakr gave a Khutba meaning speech to Muslims which is very famous: phir koran kii aayat pard kar sunai: Hearing from Hazrat Abu Bakr, all the people fell on their knees, Umar also fell on his knees and accepted this great sorrow
 jab hazarat abu bakr ko laga ki unka vaqt nazadik he to unhone agle khalipha ke liye hazarat umr ko chunaa
 Omar was well known for his extraordinary will power, intelligence, political, impartiality, justice and care for the poor and underprivileged
 hazarat abu bakr ko puri tarah se umr kii shakti or unako safal hone kii kshamta ke bare main pataa tha
 The succession of Omar was thus not as troublesome as any of the others
 hazarat abu bakr ne apni mrityu ke pehle hi hazarat usmaan ko apni vasiyat likhavai ki umr unke uttaradhikari honge
 Hazrat Abu Bakr died in August 634 AD
 umr ab calipha ho gayi tathaa ek naye daur kii shruwaat hui
