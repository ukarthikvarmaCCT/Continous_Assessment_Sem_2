 Without Gandhiji's unified personality, the Indian National Congress began to split into two parties during his two years in prison, one party led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru, who favored the party's participation in the House
 The leadership was led by Chakravarti Rajagopalacharya and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

 It was signed in March 1931 by the Treaty of Irwin Gandhi

 As a result of this agreement, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference to be held in London as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress

 In protest against this, Gandhiji took a six-day hunger strike in September 1932, which forced the government to successfully adopt a similar system of mediation by Palvankar Balu, a Dalit-turned-political leader
 achhuton ke jivan ko sudhaarney ke liye gandhi ji dwaara chalaae gaye is abhiyaan kii shuruuaat thi
 Gandhiji named these untouchables as Harijans whom they considered to be children of God
 8 may 1933 ko gandhi ji ne harijan andolan main madad karne ke liye aatm shuddhikaran kaa 21 din tak chalane vaala upwas kiya
 This new campaign was not liked by the Dalits however he remained a prominent leader

 Ambedkar and his allies also felt that Gandhiji was undermining the political rights of Dalits
 haalanki gandhi ji ek vaisya jati main paidaa hue phir bhi unhonen is baat par jor diya ki vah dow ambedkar jaise dalit masiha ke hote hue bhi vah daliton ke liye aawaaj uthaa saktaa he
 Untouchability was a major evil in the social evils of India during the Indian freedom struggle, against which Mahatma Gandhi and his followers struggled

 yaheen ek pratishthit mandir he guuruvayur mandir, jisamen krishna bhagwaan ke balaroop ke darshan karaati bhagwaan guruvayurppan kii murti sthapit he
 Like other temples before independence, there was complete ban on entry of Harijans in this temple too

 The trustees of the temple were told that the first day of the new year, that is, January 1, 1934, would be celebrated as the last decision day and that in the event of no determination from their level on this date, the activists by Mahatma Gandhi and Mr
 Kelappan Fasting can be done in favor of is kaaran guruvayur mandir ke trusteo kii ore se baithak bulaakar mandir ke upasko kii raay bhi praapt kii gayi
 In the meeting, on the basis of majority given by 77 percent of the devotees, the entry of Harijans into the temple was approved and thus the entry of Harijans as a success of the determination day in Sri Guruvayur temple in Kerala from 1 January 1934, in principle Got approval
 guruvayur mandir jisamen aaj bhi gaiyr hinduon kaa pravesh varjit he tathaapi kai dharmon ko maanane vaale bhagwaan bhagwaan guruvayurappan ke param bhakt hai
 With the inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi, the first day of January was celebrated as the determination day and the decision made was received
 
 In the summer of 1934, three unsuccessful attempts were made to kill him
 jab congress party ke chunaav ladane ke liye chunaa or sangheey yojana ke antargat satta sweekaar kii tab gandhi ji ne party kii sadsyta se istipha dene kaa nirnay le liya
 He did not disagree with the party's move but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with the Indians would facilitate the strengthening of the party's membership which has hitherto belonged to communists, socialists, trade associations, students, religious leaders
 Laker existed between trade unions and various voices
 isse in sabhi ko apni apni baton ke sun jane kaa avasar praapt hoga
 Gandhi, while leading a party for Raj, did not want to prove any goal by campaigning which would be accepted as a political arrangement with Raj temporarily
 gandhi ji nehru presidensi or congress ke lahore adhiveshan ke saath hi 1936 main bharat laut aae
 However, Gandhi wished to focus his full attention on achieving independence and not on speculation about India's future
 usne congress ko samaajwaad ko apane uddeshy ke rup main apnaane se nahin roka
 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest
 police kii goliyon se hajaaron kii sankhya main swatantraaa senaanee yaa to maare gaye yaa ghayal ho gaye or hajaaron giraftaar kar liye gaye
 Gandhi and his supporters made it clear that he would not support the war effort unless India was granted immediate independence
 unhone spasht kiya ki is baar bhi yah aandolan band nahin hoga yadi hinsa ke vyaktigat krityon ko moort rup diya jaataa he
 He said that the order of chaos around him is worse than real anarchy
 unhone sabhi congressiyon or bharatiyon ko ahimsa ke saath karo yaa maro ke dwaara antim swatantrata ke liye anushaasan banaae rakhane ko kaha
 Gandhiji and all members of the Congress Working Committee were arrested by the British on 9 August 1942 in Mumbai
 gandhi ji ko pune ke anga khan mahal main do saal tak bandi banaakar rakhaa gaya
 This was the time when Gandhiji suffered two deep blows in his personal life

 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega
 Between 1948, over 5000 people were killed during the violence
 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 Leaders like Sardar Patel feared that Pakistan could use this money to wage war against India
 jab yah maang uthne lagi ki sabhi muslimon ko pakistan bheja jaae or muslimon or hindu netaaon ne is par asantosh vyakt kiya or ek duusare ke saath samjhauta karne se manaa karne se gandhi ji ko gaharaa sadma pahunchaa
 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil

 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag

 If you believe in this thing like me, then you will be quick to take decisions and believe that the practice of untouchability like we practice today is not in the Hindu scriptures
 aap mere is vichaar se sahamat honge ki kisi bhi manushya ko asprishy maananaa ek bhayankar paap he
 Man's ego tells him that he is superior to other people

 In modern times geometrical concepts have been generalized to a high degree of imaginary and complexity and have used methods of calculus and imaginary algebra to such an extent that many modern branches of the field are hardly as offspring of early geometry
 Are recognized only
 dekhen bijaganitiya jyamiti or ganit ke kshetra
 The earliest recorded beginnings of geometry can be traced back to the time of the primitive people - who discovered the uncolored triangles in the ancient Indus Valley and ancient Babylonia around 3000 BCE
 praarambhik jyamiti lambaaiyon, konon, kshetrafalon or aaytanon se sambandhit anubhavik rup se avishkrut siddhanton kaa ek sangrah tha jinhen surveykshan, nirmaan, khagol vidya or vibhinn shilpon main kuch vyaavhaarik jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha
 Some of these theories were surprisingly complex and it may prove difficult for a modern mathematician to use some of them without the use of calculus
 udhaaharan ke liye, misravasi or babilonian donon pithagoras prameya ke sanskarnon se pithagoras se lagbhag 1500 saal pehle se hi parichit the; mistra vaasiyon ke paas ek vargakar pyramid ke frestom ke aaytan ke liye ek sahi formula maujuud tha; babilonian logon ke paas ek trikonmiti kii talika maujuud thi
 Ancient Egyptians knew that they could estimate the area of a circle in the following way: ames pepirus kii samasya 50 main ek aise niyam ke anusaar ki kshetrafal vrutt ke vyas ke 8 / 9 ke varg ke baraabar hota he, ek vrutt ke kshetrafal kii gananaa ke liye in vidhiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is assumed that the value of π is 4 × 2 with an error of slightly more than 0
63 percent
 yah maan babilonian gananaa se kuch kam sahi tha lekin anyathaa yah archemides ke 211875 / 67441 = 3
14163 ke lagbhag sahi anumaan se aage nahin nikal paaya tha jisamen 10,000 main sirf 1 se adhik kii truti thi)
 Interestingly, Ames was familiar with an almost perfect approximation of the modern 22 / 7 for the pie and used it to divide a hecat, hecat x 22 / xx 7 / 22 = hecat; However, Ames continued to use the traditional value of pie 256 / 81 to calculate its hectare volume found in a cylinder
 samasya 48 main kinare kii 9 ikaayiyon ke saath ek varg kaa upyog karnaa shaamil tha
 This square was cut into a 3x3 grid
 kone ke virgon ke vikarn ko 63 ikaayiyon ke ek kshetrafal ke saath ek aniyamit ashtakon banane ke liye istemaal kiya gaya tha
 This gave a second value of 3

 Problem 14 in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus gives the only ancient example to find the volume of the frustum of a pyramid, whose correct formula is as follows: babylon ke log sambhawatah kshetrafalon or aaytanon kii maap ke liye saamaanya niyamon ko jaanate the
 He measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter, and the area as the twelfth of the square of the circumference, which would have been correct if the value of π was considered 3
 The volume of a cylinder was taken as a product of the base and height, although the volume of a conical frustum or square of a pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half of the base
 pithagoras prameya ke bare main babylon ke logon ko bhi jaankaree thi
 Also in a recent discovery the value of π in a tablet was used as 3 and 1 / 8
 babylon ke log babilonian mile ke liye bhi jane jate hai jo aaj ke lagbhag saat mile kii duuri ke baraabar duuri kii ek maap thi
 This measurement for distances was eventually changed to a time-mile to measure the travel of the Sun and therefore represents time

 He expanded the range of geometry to many new types of figures, turns, surfaces, and solids; They changed its system from trial-and-error to logical deduction; He recognized that geometry studies "invariant forms" or abstraction for which physical objects are only approximations; And he developed the idea of the "axiomatic method" that is still in use today
 militus ke thels pehle vyakti the jinhen ganit main ghataav ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he
 There are five geometric propositions for which he gave proofs of subtraction, although his proofs did not survive
 Pythagoras, from Ionia and later Italy, where the Greeks were then inhabited, was probably a student of Thales and traveled to Babylon and Egypt
 vah prameya jo unke naam se he sambhawatah yah unki khoj nahin rahi hogi, lekin shaayad ve iske liye ghataav sambandhi pramaan dene vaale pehle vyakti the
 He gathered a group of students around him to study mathematics, music and philosophy, and together they discovered most of the things that high school students today study in their geometry courses

 Evidence was presented and indeed deductive mathematical evidence did not appear until after Parmesides
 sabase badi baat he ki thels ke bare main ham kul milakar yahi kah sakate hai ki unhone unaniyon ke saamne vibhinn jyamitiya pramayon kii shuruyaat kii
 The idea that mathematics was deductive since its inception is incorrect
 thels ke samay ganit vivechanaatmak tha
 This means that Thales would have "presented" empirical and direct evidence, but not deductive evidence)
 darshanik plato unaniyon ke liye sabase sammanit hasti the jinhone apane suprasiddh skool ke pravesh dwaar ke upar likhaa tha, "yahan aakar koi bhi jyamiti se anbhigya nahin rahegaa
" haalanki ve swayan ek ganitagya nahin the lekin ganit ke bare main unke vichaaron kaa kaaphi prabhaav tha
 So mathematicians accepted his belief that geometry should not use any device other than compass and straightedge - never measuring instruments such as a marked ruler or an intersection, because these are the tools of workmen, a scholar
 Not fit for yah ukti sambhavit compass or streetes nirmaanon or teen paramparaagat nirmaan sambandhi samasyaon ke gahan adhyayan kaa kaaran bani: kisi kone ko teen bhaagon main baantne, kisi die gaye ghan ke aaytan kaa doguna ghan kaa nirmaan karne or kisi die gaye vrutt ke kshetrafal ke baraabar ek varg kaa nirmaan karne main in upkarnon kaa upyog kaise karen
 Evidence of the impossibility of these constructions was finally achieved in the 19th century, which led to the development of important theories in the context of the deep structure of real number systems
 plato ke sabase bade shishy arestu ne un nigamanaatmak pramaanon main upyog kiye gaye tark ke tareekon par ek granth likhaa tha jinamein 19veen sadi tak kaaphi sudhaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 Euclid, who was related to Alexandria, possibly a student of Plato's students, wrote a treatise in 13 books titled The Elements of Geometry, in which he presented geometry in an ideal axiom, called Euclidean
 Became known as geometry

 Had he not been a mathematician, he would have been remembered as a great physicist, engineer and inventor
 In his mathematics, he developed methods very similar to the coordinate systems of analytical geometry and the restrictive process of integral calculus

 haalanki kuch choti hastiyon kaa aana abhi baaki tha lekin jyamiti kaa swarna yug samaapt ho gaya tha
 The author of the Commentary on the First Book of Euclid was one of the last important personalities of Hellenistic geometry

 Civil war, decreasing investment in maintenance and the acquisition of new scrolls and a generally decreasing interest in non-religious activities probably contributed to the library's decline in the structure of material available, especially in the fourth century

 The Shatapatha Brahmana incorporates rules for religious geometric constructions like the Sulba Sutra
 sulb sutara main yagyagni kii vediyon ke nirmaan ke niyamon kii suchi di gayi he
 Most of the mathematical problems included in the Sulb Sutra derive from "a single religious requirement" which relates to the construction of fire altars of different sizes but taking the same place

 According to the Sulb Sutra, "the earliest prevalent oral interpretation of Pythagoras's theorem in the world is included, though ancient Babylonian people were already aware of it
" " The angular formula of an ellipse produces both those that are sideways and horizontally
 " Since the statement is a formula, it is necessarily compressed and what is received by the formulas is not interpreted, but the context clearly states the square area built on their lengths and is probably explained to the student by a teacher Will happen

 daani isse aage kehete hai: "since the main purpose of the sulvasutra was to describe the structure of the altars and the geometrical principles involved in them, the subject of Pythagoras' triples, even if it was well understood, would probably not have been mentioned in the sulvasutra
 Triples in sulvasutras The presence of can be compared to the mathematics that an introduction written on any architecture or other related practical area Muck can see in the book and it will not be directly related to the complete knowledge of the subject at that time
 Because unfortunately no other contemporary source has been found, it is never possible to find a solution to this problem in full satisfaction

 haalanki mo jing china main jyamiti par likhi gayi sabase puraani maujuuda pustak he, is baat kii bhi sambhaavna he ki isse puraani likhit saamagree astitv main he
 However, due to the infamous incident of burning books in the political tactic of Qin dynasty ruler Qin Shi Huang, a large number of written literature was composed before his time was refined
 iske alaava mo jing ganit main un jyamitiya avadharanaon ko prastut karata he jo shaayad itnaa adhit unnat the ki unka koi pichhlaa jyamitiya aadhaar nahin tha yaa ganitiya prishthbhumi nahin thi jis par kaary kiya ja sake
 Mo Jing described various aspects of many areas related to physics and also offered a small collection of information on mathematics
 isane jyamitiya bindu kii ek 'parmanvik' paribhaasha is prakaar se di thi ki ek rekha ko kai bhaagon main alag-alag kiya ja saktaa he or jis bhaag kaa koi shesh bhaag nahin hoga or is prakaar us rekha kaa antim sira ek bindu ke rup main hoga
 Much like Euclid's first and third definitions and Plato's 'beginning of a line' Mo Jing said that "a point is present at the end or at the beginning of it, like the head appearing during childbirth
" isamen koi bhi samanta nahin he
 "like the atomists of Democritus, Mo Jing said that the point is the smallest unit and cannot be cut into two parts, because two pieces of" zero "cannot be drawn
 khaali sthaan or ghire hue sthaan ke siddhanton ke saath-saath samanaantar rekhaon ke liye or lambaaiyon kii tulana ke liye paribhaashaayen dete hue, isamen kaha gaya tha ki samaan lambaai kii do rekhaaen hameshaa ek hi sthaan par samaapt hongi
 isamen is tathy kaa bhi varnan kiya gaya tha ki motaai kii gunvattta ke bagaiyr samatalon ko badhaayaa nahin ja saktaa he kyonki ve aapas main ek duusare ko sparsh nahin kar sakate hai
 In this book, definitions of circumference, diameter and radius were given along with the definition of quantity

 Although Pai's estimates were roughly given in Zhao Li, it was Zhang Heng who first made a joint effort to formulate a far more precise formula for the pie
 badale main ise jhu chongjhi jaise baad ke chiniyon dwaara kahin adhik sateek banaaya gaya hoga
 Zhang Heng estimated the approximate proximity of the pie as 730 / 232, although he used another formula of pie using a square root of 10 instead to calculate the volume of a sphere

 Problems in this book were included where geometry was used, such as deriving the surface area of squares and circles, the volume of solids in various three-dimensional shapes, as well as the use of the Pythagoras theorem
 is pustak main pithagoras prameya ke liye sachitr pramaan prastut kiye gaye the, saath hi samakon tribhuj ke gunon par jhaau ke purv duk or shang gaao ke bich ek likhit samvaad or pithagoras prameya bhi sanlagn tha
 Editor Liu Hui listed the pie as 3

 The Islamic Khilafat, established in the whole of the Middle East, North Africa, Spain, Portugal and parts of Persia, began around 640 CE
 is avadhi ke dauraan islamic ganitagya jyamitiya hone kii bajaay mukhya rup se bijaganitiya the, haalanki jyamiti par bhi mahatvapurn kaary kiye gaye the
 Scholarship declined in Europe and eventually the Hellenistic creations of antiquity fell out of their hands and remained only in Islamic centers of education
 haalanki muslim ganitagyon ko bijganit, sankhya siddhant or sankhya pranaaliyon par unke kaaryon ke liye kaaphi khyaati mili he, unhone jyamiti, trikonmiti or ganitiya khagol vigyaan ke liye bhi kaaphi yogadan diya he or ve bijaganitiya jyamiti ke vikaas ke liye bhi jimmedaar the
 However geometrical magnitudes were seen as "algebraic objects" by most Muslim mathematicians
 mohammad ebn musa al-quarizmi ke uttaradhikari, jo farsi vidwaan, ganitagya or khagolvid the, unhone ganit main kalan vidhi kaa avishkaar kiya tha jo computer science kaa aadhaar he, jisane ankaganit se bijganit, bijganit se ankaganit, donon se trikonmiti, beej ganit se sankhyaon kaa euclidian siddhant, bijganit se jyamiti or jyamiti se bijganit ke kramagat anuprayog kaa kaary kiya he
 This is how polynomial algebra, coincident analysis, numerical analysis, numerical solution of equations, new elementary theory of numbers and geometric structure of equations were created
 al mahani ne jyamitiya samasyaon jaise ki bijganit kii samasyaon ke liye tritiy ghaat kii dviravriti ko kam karne ke vichaar kii kalpana kii thi
 Al Qaraji completely freed algebra from geometric activities and replaced them with the arithmetic type of activities that exist today in algebra basis
 thabit ebn kurraa janm ne ganit ke kai kshetron main yogadan diya he jahaan unhone sankhya ko vaastavik sankhyaon main vistaar kii avadharana, abhinn kalan, goleey trikonmiti ke pramayon, vishleshnatmak jyamiti or gaiyr-euclidian jyamiti jaise mahatvapurn ganitiya khojon ke liye maarg taiyaar karne main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 In astronomy Thabit was one of the first reformers of the Ptolemaic system and in mechanics he was a founder of statics
 thabit kii rachanaaon kaa ek mahatvapurn jyamitiya pahalu anupaaton kii sanrachana par unki pustak ke rup main tha
 Thabit in this book describes the arithmetic operations used for the proportions of geometric quantities
 unaniyon ne jyamitiya matraaon ke saath kaam kiya tha lekin unhone inke bare main use tareeke se nahin sochaa tha jaisaa ki ankaganit ke saamaanya niyamon ko lagu karne main kiya ja saktaa tha
 By introducing arithmetic operations on quantities previously considered geometric and non-numerical, Thabit started a trend that eventually led to the generalization of the concept of numbers
 kuch maamalon main, vishesh rup se gati ke sandarbh main thabit plato or arestu ke vichaaron ke aalochak hai
 His ideas here seem to be based on his acceptance of the use of arguments in terms of motion in his geometric arguments
 jyamiti ke liye thabit kaa ek anya mahatvapurn yogadan unke dwaara pithagoras prameya kaa samanyikaran he, jisamen unhone ek saamaanya pramaan ke saath vishesh samakonon ko aam taur par sabhi trikonon main vistaarit kiya tha
 Ibrahim ibn Sinan ibn Thabit, who introduced a method of far more general integration than Archimedes, and Al Qohi were pioneers in the revival of Greek high-level geometry and its continuation in the Islamic world

 In 2007, Professor Peter Lu of Harvard University and Professor Paul Stanhardt of Princeton University published a document in Science magazine with the suggestion that the features in Girih tiling were in continuation of auto-similar partial quasicrystalline tiling, such as Penrose tiling, The relationship was with them five centuries ago
 jab europe ne apane andh yug se nikalnaa shuru kiya, islamic pustakaalayon main maujuud jyamiti ke helenistic or islamic granthon kaa arabi se latin main anuwaad kiya gaya
 The rigorous deductive methods of geometry found in Euclid's Elements of Geometry were re-studied and further the evolution of geometry in the styles of both Euclid and Khayyam continued, resulting in a multiplicity of new theorems and theories, many of which Were very thorough and comfortable

 It proved to be an essential precursor to the development of the exact quantitative science of calculus and physics
 is avadhi kii duusari jyamitiya pragati girard desarges dwaara projective jyamiti ke silsilewar adhyayan ke rup main thi
 Projective geometry is the study of geometry without measurement, that is, just the study of how the points align with each other
 is kshetra main helenistic jyamitikaron, ullekhneey rup se papas dwaara kuch shuruuaati kaary kiye gaye the
 The greatest flowering of the field was with Jean Victor Poncilet
 17veen sadi ke uttararddh main calculas ko ijac newton or gotfred wilhem won libnij dwaara swatantra rup se or lagbhag ek saath viksit kiya gaya tha
 This was the beginning of a new field of mathematics now called analysis
 haalanki yah swayan jyamiti kii ek shakha nahin he, phir bhi jyamiti main iskaa prayog hota he or isane samasyaon ke do pariwaron kaa hal kiya tha jo kaaphi samay se lagbhag adiyal bani hui thi: visham vakron main sparsh rekhaon kaa pataa lagaana or un vakron se ghire kshetrafalon kaa pataa lagaana
 calculas kii vidhi ne gananaa ke zyaadaatar sidhe maamalon main in samasyaon ko kam kar diya
 The old problem of attesting Euclid's four postulates to his fifth postulate, the "parallel postulate", was never forgotten
 euclid ke kuch hi samay baad prastutiyon ke kai prayaas kiye gaye lekin kuch aise siddhanton ko, jo tark main sweekruti ke jariye swayan pehali chaar abhidharanaon se pramanit nahin hue the, baad main bhi doshapurn paaya gaya
 Although Umar Khayyam also failed to prove the parallel concept, his criticisms of Euclid's theories of parallels and his proof of the properties of numbers in non-euclidean geometry eventually contributed to the development of non-euclidean geometry

 Beginning with the suspicion that parallel concepts were impossible to validate, he worked on the development of a self-consistent geometry in which that concept was incorrect
 isamen ve safal rahe the or is prakaar pehle gaiyr-eucalidian jyamiti kii rachana hui
 In 1854 Bernhard Reimann, a student of Gauss, used the method of calculus in a tremendous study of the internal geometry of all smooth surfaces and thus developed a different non-euclidean geometry
 riman ke kaary baad main oinstin ke saapekshata ke siddhant kaa aadhaar ban gaye the
 It remains to be proved that non-euclidean geometry was as self-consistent as Euclidean geometry and this work was first completed in 1868 by Beltrami
 isi ke saath gaiyr-eucalidian jyamiti, eucalidian jyamiti ke saath ek samaan ganitiya str par sthapit ho gayi thi
 Although it was now known that various geometrical theories were mathematically possible, the question remains, "which of these theories is true for our physical world?" Mathematical work revealed that this question should be answered through physical experiments and not mathematical reasoning, as well as the reason why infinite distances must be included in this experiment
 bhautikee main saapekshata ke siddhant ke vikaas ke saath yah sawaal bahut adhik jatil ho gaya
 All the work related to parallel concepts showed that it was quite difficult for a geographer to separate his logical basis from his understanding of the physical world and in addition to the critical importance of doing so
 Careful testing revealed some logical flaws in Euclid's reasoning and some untold geometric principles about which Euclid would sometimes point out
 is aalochana ne calculas main aane vaali mushkilon or anant prakriyaaon jaise ki abhisaran or nirantarata ke arth ke sandarbh main vishleshan ko samanaantar bana diya
 There was a clear need for a new set of axioms in geometry that could be fulfilled and which is not based in any way on the photos we make or our intuition about space
 is tarah kii sukhtiyaan 1894 main david hilbert dwaara unke shodh-niabandh grandlajen dar jeeyometry main di gayi thim
 Some other complete sets of axioms were given a few years earlier, but they did not match Hilbert's axioms in terms of economy, elegance, and similarity to Euclid's axioms
 18veen sadi ke madhya main yah spasht ho gaya ki ganitiya tark kii kuch khaas kadiyaan us samay viksit huin jab sankhya rekha par, do ayaamon main or teen ayaamon main isi tarah ke vichaaron par adhyayan kiya gaya tha
 Thus the general concept of a metric space was created so that the reasoning could be more comprehensive and then used in special cases
 calculas ke adhyayan kii yah vidhi- or vishleshan sambandhi avadharanaon ko analysis saitus ke rup main or baad main topology ke rup main janaa gaya
 Important topics in this area were the properties of far more general statistics such as jointness and boundaries rather than properties such as straightness and length and the precise quality of angular measurements, which had been central to Euclidean and non-euclidean geometry
 topology jald hi jyamiti yaa vishleshan ke ek up-kshetra kii bajaay pramukh mahatv kaa ek alag kshetra ban gaya
 The development of algebraic geometry involved the study of curves and surfaces on finite fields as demonstrated by the works of Andre Weill, Alexander Grotendić, and jean-pierre Serre, among others, as well as on real or complex numbers

 kuposhan ke kaaran bacchon or mahilaon kii rog pratirohak kshamta kam ho jaati he, jisase ve aasaani se kai tarah kii bimariyon ke shikaar ban jate hai
 Therefore, it is very important to have information about malnutrition
 kuposhan praaia: paryaapt santulit ahaar ke abhaav main hota he
 Malnutrition is at the root of most diseases of children and women
 striyon main raktaalpata yaa ghengha rog athwa bacchon main sookhaa rog yaa rataundhi or yahan tak ki andhatv bhi kuposhan ke hi dushprinaam hai
 Apart from this, there are fifty such diseases due to insufficient or unbalanced food
