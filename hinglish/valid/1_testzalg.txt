 The creative power of imagination and contemporary experience of culture is the reason for Konark's successful theatrical work
 konark ke ant or ghatnatmak tivrata tathaa parisamapti par vivaad sambhav he, parantu uske sampreshnatmak prabhaav par prashn chinh sambhav nahin he
 Using the composition and atmosphere of the play 'first King' as a medium and 'reference', the author has tried to explain the human relationship between the system and the Prajhit

 shakti-santulan kaa siddhanth yah maanata he ki koi raashtra tab adhik surakshit hota he jab sainik kshamta is prakaar banty hui ho ki koi akelaa rajya itnaa shaktishaalee na ho ki vah akele anya rajyon ko dabaa de
 The concept of balance of power has been prevalent in the international stage since about the 15th century
 shaayad isiilie kuch lekhak ise antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa buniyadi siddhanth to kuch ise saarvajanik siddhanth yaa raajnneeti ke moulik siddhanth kii sangya dete hai
 In general terms, balance of power means when one state / group of states increases its power relative to another state / group of states so that it becomes equivalent to it
 parantu is dharna kii paribhaasha ko lekar vidyaman ekamat nahin hai
 Perhaps this is why Inins L
 Claude says that this is a concept that does not have a definition problem but rather that it has many definitions
 in paribhaashaon se pehle yah bataanaa bhi aavashyak he ki yah do prakaar kii hoti hai -saral evam jatil
 Simple or simple power balance occurs when the comparison is directly between two nations or between two nations
 lekin yadi yah santulan do samudaayon ke paraspar tathaa inamen sammilit samudaayon main aantarik rup main bhi ho tab yah jatil santulan kehalaata he
 In this context, scholars have given various definitions which are as follows- prayek raashtra yathasthiti ko banaaye rakhane athwa parivartit karne ke liye duusare raashton kii apeksha adhik shakti praapt karne kii aakanksha rakhata he
 As a result, the structure required is called balance of power
 shakti santulan vah samyavastha yaa antarrashtriya sambandh main kuch maatra main sthirataa yaa sthayitv he, jo rajyon ke bich maitra-sandhiyon yaa anya duusare sadhano kii madad se praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 The balance of power is the system under which every state constantly tries to maintain the belief that if states try aggression they will have to resist a group of invincible other nations
 shakti santulan se abhipraay raashton ke pariwaron ke sadasyon ke bich shakti kii nyaaypurna samyavastha se he jo kisi raashtra ko itnaa shaktishaalee hone se roktaa he taaki vah duusare raashtra par apni ichha lad na sake
 Thus, the balance of power has been seen by scholars from different countries
 koi ise shakti ke vitaran ke rup main dekhte hai to koi ise samoohon ke bich samyavastha ke rup main, koi ise sthayitv ke rup main, to koi ise yuddh va asthirataa ke rup main
 This is to say that these definitions lack consensus
 shaayad yah isliye hai ki shakti santulan ke anek arth / prayog hai jis vajah se yah bhranti bani hui he
 Mainly, the balance of power is used in four contexts - quinci rhit ke anusaar shakti santulan kaa siddhanth paanch manyataon par aadhaarit he- The balance of power has the following characteristics: saamaanya rup se yah yathasthiti banaae rakhane kii niti he, parantu vastav main yah hameshaa gatisheel va parivartaneey hoti he
 It is not a divine boon but it is the result of continuous human intervention
 yah vyaktiparak va vastunishth donon prakaar se paribhaashit hota he
 Historians always objectively assess it, while diplomats always subjectively analyze it
 yadhyapi yah shaanti sthapit karne kaa tantra he, parantu yah mushkil se hi kabhi shaanti sthapit karata he
 It is mainly a game of superpowers
 chote raashtra to maatra darshak kii bhoomika hi nibhaate hai
 An operator is needed for its correct operation which is absent in today's era
 yah samyavastha ke aadhaar par shaktiyon kaa samaan vitaran karata he
 But it is known from looking at the history of international politics that there has never been such a time
 shakti santulan kii vyavastha antarrashtriya raajnneeti main shaayad hi dashshtigochar ho, kyonki shakti tatv kaa maapna va sthir kar paanaa sambhav nahin he
 www

com shakti santulan kii sthapana hetu nimnlikhit tareekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he- Sometimes big powers divide the land of small states for mutual power balance
 yah seemaa parivartan is aadhaar par kiya jaataa he ki aapasi shaktiyon main se koi bhi ek duusare se shaktishaalee na ban jaae
 In 1713, after the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain's land was divided between Bourbon and Hapsburg after the Treaty of Utrecht
 isi prakaar poland ko teen baar main is prakaar vibhajit kiya gaya ki shakti santulan na bigade
 Similarly, in the 18th and 19th centuries, various treaties were made keeping this view in mind
 maitri sandhiyaan bhi shakti santulan kaa pramukh saadhan rahi he
 But when a nation increases its power through Maitra treaties, then other states also become apprehensive and start making treaties with each other
 is kram kaa ant vishwa ke sabhi raashton dwaara virdohi guton main sangathit hokar hota he
 This type of Maitra treaties and the era of Maitra treaties are commonly seen in the politics of Europe

 Similar examples emerged in the form of alliances established between the superpowers after World War II
 shastreekaran shakti kaa pratyaksh evam agratam rup he
 That is why among the states, especially from their rival, there is a competition to store weapons
 is sanchay se unki sainya shakti kaa vikaas hota he tathaa apane virodhiyon par dabaav badhaane ke kaam aata he
 But the other nation or group of states also does not want to be left behind, so both want to balance each other
 udhaahranswaroop, shityudh yug main purv soviet sangh va america ke bich shastreekaran hi donon dwaara ek duusare ko santulit karne kaa madhyam rahaa he
 Along with international political armament, disarmament also sometimes works to balance between the powers
 jab shastreekaran ek charam seemaa ke baad aage badhanaa sambhav na rah sake tab shaktiyaan nirastrikaran kii taraf kadam badhaati he
 As an example, the Salt-1 Salt-2 Start-1 and Start-2 INF Treaty etc
 agreements between the two superpowers are proof of this
 anya raashton ke bich bhi vartmaan samay main shastrakaran se tang aakar vishwasaneeyata badhaane vaale kadamon kaa uthaaya janaa iskaa pramaan he
 Many times the two powers maintain a mutual balance by avoiding any direct confrontation and keeping any one state at the center
 atah aisa kamjor va tatasth rajya hameshaa do badi takaton ke bich yuddh kii sambhaavnaaen tali rahane ke saath-saath shakti santulan bhi bana rahata he
 For example, for a long time Poland remained an intermediate state between Russia and Germany
 afghanistan, rus va england ke bich is sthiti main kaaphi der tak rahaa
 Sometimes two non-allies divide the intermediate region equally
 aisi sthiti main madhyavarti kshetron kaa prabhaav nunatam ho jaataa he
 For example, the partition of Germany, Korea, indo-china
 vartmaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ye kshetra samaapt praaia ho gayi hai
 Therefore, their effect has also become negligible for the balance of power
 hastkshep kii niti hameshaa shaktishaalee raashton dwaara duusare ke maamle main dakhlandaji karke apane prabhaav ko badhaane se he
 Its purpose is in the form of continuation or change of a regime there by the big nation
 is saadhan ke madhyam se shakti santulan banaaye rakhane kaa prayaas hota he
 It was used extensively by both the superpowers during the Cold War period
 purv soviet sangh ne jahaan hungary, checkoslovakia va afghanistan main hastkshep kiya, vahiin america ne grrenada, cuba, nikaragua, korea, iraq, afghanistan aadi main hastkshep kiya he
 The policy of balancing laissez-faire has generally been adopted by smaller nations
 isse chote rajyon dwaara tatastha ke rup main apanaaya gaya he
 In some circumstances, even large nations have resorted to it
 zyaadaatar asia, africa evam latin america deshon ne gut nirpekshata kii niti apanaakar ahastkshep niti kaa paalan kiya he
 Due to this, attempts to not fight or keep it limited or to give it its local form etc
 come under this
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti main badi takaton dwaara foot daalo, raaj karo kii niti kaa bhi anusaran kiya he
 Even by dividing the states into two opposing factions, the powers establish the balance of power in that region
 yah niti mukhya rup se britain dwaara apane samrajya ko ekikrut rakhane hetu kaaphi baar prayog kii gai
 The indo-pak partition of 1947 is a strong example of this
 is niti ke antargat apane pratidwandiyon ko kamjor karke santulan banane kaa prayaas kiye jate rahe hai
 In the Cold War period, the superpowers have also followed this type of policy in non-aligned countries
 yadi shakti santulan kaa moolyankan karen to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki is tareeke se shakti par purna simaaen to na lag saki
 Yes, to some extent this theory was successful in its objectives
 is siddhanth ke purna rup se shakti ke vikaas par ankush na laga paane ke nimnlikhit kaaran rahe- It is clear from the above thoughts that this principle is not fully capable of expanding power or preventing power struggle
 lekin iske madhyam se aanshik safalataa avashya milti he, kyonki - pratham, chote rajya apni suraksha aashwast kar sakate hai
 Second, it will also curb the establishment of the hegemony of a large power
 tritiy, yah yudhon ko bhi taalane main sakasham he
 Fourth, in the absence of any central authority over sovereign states, international law is also possible only with the balance of power
 atah yah kuch had tak shakti ke nirankush yaa aadhipaty sthapit karne kii sambhaawanaaon ko aanshik rup main rokane main sakasham he

 This swelling is called indigo or crushing! The shape of this indigo is found according to the object from which it has been hurt

 upalambh kavy kaa vivaran According to ancient Sanskrit Hindi poetry, Upalambha poetry is mainly a distinction of Shringarakavya, in which the trusted friend of the heroine gives the epithet to the hero to the hero
 lekin sarvatra sakhi dwaara hi nayika nayak ko upalanbhpurn sandesh nahin detii, balki sanyog shringaar main nayika swayan hi nayak ko upalambh detii he
 Sometimes the heroine, bird, cloud or wind also sends the protagonist to the corner
 aisa praaia: viyog shringaar main dekh padataa he
 In folklore, Virahini gives the heroine Kaga through birds, or through a wanderer from the migrant husband's city of Nagradi
 navaprinita yuvati maayke ke athmiya janon kii abhaavjnya vednaa tathaa bahan bhai kii kalpit upeksha kaa upalambh detii dekh padati he
 Devout poets, who are slaves towards the presiding deity, have also taken shelter of the Upalambha
 kintu yah paribhaasha apane main purna nahin he
 There is no reproach or condemnation of the beloved; Its main sense is, somehow the feeling or effort of dear companionship, collaborative ambivalence and desire for union
 paribhaasha ke isi vaishishty ke kaaran upalambh kavy keval shringaar tak hi simit nahin mana ja saktaa
 In Hindi Bhaktikavya the Upalambha is found in sufficient quantity
 radha tathaa gopiyon ke upalambh ke saath mata yashoda kaa krishna ke prati madhur upalambh, krishna kaa yashoda tathaa balram ke prati upalambh tathaa vinayabhaavna ke antargat bhakton kaa apane aradhy ke prati upalambh bhi bhakthikavy ke sundar prasang hai
 After Nanda, Yashoda, Radha, Gopa, Gopis are all very sad after Krishna left for Mathura, at the same time Uddhav comes to convince Gopis on behalf of Krishna
 shrimadbhagwat ke dasham skandh main gopiyon dwaara uddhav ko uplakshya banaakar krishna ko upalambh dene kaa atyant sundar varnan he
 The same theme is named in poetry as "bhramgrit"
 maithil kavi vidyapati, chandidas, surdaas, nandadaas aadi pracheen kaviyon ne ; bhaaratendu harishchandra or jagannathdas ratnakar aadi idhar ke kaviyon ne upalambh kavy kaa paryaapt prayog kiya he
 Some humorous poets have also resorted to the yatra-tatra Upalambha

 bahya pratyakshvaad gyanamimasaa kaa ek siddhanth he jiske anusaar bahya vastu kaa gyaan anumaan se nahin varan pratyaksh praapt hota he
 Direct knowledge cannot be inferred without being considered possible
 yadi bahya vastu kaa pratyaksh kabhi na hua hon, to maansik pratirupon se bahya vastu kaa astitv siddh hi nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore knowledge of the external object is essentially direct
 indriyon ke dwaara jo kuch dikhaai yaa sunai padataa he, bahya vastuen waisi hi hoti hai
 The promoters of the Vaibhashika branch of Buddhist philosophy in India accept this principle
 ve bahya vastu or man donon kaa astitv maanate hai
 Direct knowledge of external object is obtained in the mind
 yah pratyaksh gyaan indriyon ke madhyam se hota he
 The senses come into contact with the external world and receive a kind of ritual from it
 ve un sanskaron ke saath chitt ko prabud kar usamen chetana utpann kar detii hai
 Only then the knowledge of the world arises in the mind
 jo vastu indriyagrahya nahin he, use man bhi nahin jaan saktaa
 Therefore, the power of Indian objects is not acceptable to the Vaibhashikas

 guide 1965 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 It is based on the novel The Guide of India's famous English writer RK Narayan
 film shuru hoti he vartmaan se jab raju jail se reeha ho rahaa he or phir kahani ateet main chalati he
 Raju is a guide who earns his money by turning tourists into historical sites
 ek din, ek amir or boodha puratatvavid marco unki yuva patni rozi, jo ki ek veshya kii beti he, ke saath shahar main aata he
 Marco wants to do some research in caves outside the city and hires Raju as his guide
 vah ek nai gupha kaa pataa lagaataa he or apane kaam main itnaa kho jaataa he ki rozi par dhyaan nahin detaa
 While Marco is searching for the cave, Raju takes Rosie for a walk and praises her dancing ability and innocence
 rozi raju ko bataati he ki vah ek veshya kii beti he or vah samaaj main sammaan hasil karne ke liye kaise marco kii patni bani, lekin uske liye usne ek badi keemat chukaai he kyonki use nrity kaa junun he jabaki yah marco ko sakht naapsand he
 Meanwhile, Rosie tries to commit suicide by consuming poison
 is ghatana kii khabar milane par marco gufaaon se waapas aata he or roji ko thik dekh kar kaafii naaraaz hota he or rozi se kahata he ki uski aatmahatya karne kii koshish ek naatak thi, anyathaa agar vah vastav main maranaa chaahati thi to adhik neend kii goliyaan khaakar yah aasaani se kar sakati thi
 One day when Rosie goes to the caves, she finds that Marco is in love with a tribal girl
 isko lekar rozi or marco main kaafii kaha-suni hoti he or rozi ek baar phir aatmahatya karne kii koshish karti he
 Raju explains to her that suicide is a sin and he lives to fulfill his dream
 rozi marco se sambandh tod leti he lekin ab use sar chupaane ke liye jagah chaiye or kisi kaa sahaara bhi jo use raju detaa he
 Rosie is also considered a prostitute in Raju's community
 raju kii maan or mamaa usase aagrah karte hai ki rozi ko ghar se baahar nikaal de lekin raju manaa kar detaa he to uski maan use chhodkar apane bhai ke saath rahane chali jaati he
 His friend and driver Ghafoor also takes a break from his life
 raju kii aamadani khatm ho jaati he or puraa shahar uske khilaaf ho jaataa he
 Despite all this, Raju encourages and helps Rosie to become a singer and dancer
 or jald hi rozi ek star ban jaati he
 As soon as Rosie touches new heights, Raju starts loitering and becomes gambling and addictive
 ab phir marco waapas aata he
 With a mind of trying to win Rosie back, he comes to meet Rosie and brings a bouquet of flowers
 bich main usase raju takaraa jaataa he or raju usase phulon kaa guladasta le letaa he
 Marco tells Raju that Rosie has some jewels stored in a locker and that Rosie's signature is needed to be removed
 raju, is ashanka main ki yadi marco or rozi dobaaraa mili to unke sambandh phir na sthapit ho jaayen, loker ke peparon main rozi ke jaali hastakshar kar detaa he, lekin marco ko rozi se milane nahin detaa he
 Meanwhile, Raju and Rosie's relations get upset when she even refuses Raju to come to her and says that if Raju comes close to her, she will go out
 is se pehle donon main bahes huyi thi or rozi ne marco ko yaad kar kaha tha ki shaayad marco thik kahata tha ki mard ko aurat kii aamadani main nahin jeena chaiye
 In response, Raju says that it is Rosie's misconception that she has become a star on her own and Raju also has a big hand in making her a star
 kuch samay baad rozi ko jaalsaaji kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Raju gets a two-year sentence
 rozi ko yah samaj nahin aata he ki raju ne jaalsaaji kyon kii jabaki vah rozi se sidhe paise maang saktaa he
 Raju had taken such a step in Rosie's love, not for the sake of money, because he did not want to let Marco and Rosie meet
 ab film vartmaan main laut aati he
 On the day of Raju's release, Rosie and Raju's mother come to take him to jail but they find that Raju has been released six months ago due to good conduct
 rozi or raju kii maan apane manmutav mitaa dete hai
 After being released, Raju wanders alone
 garibi, niraashaa, bhukh or akelepan ke kaaran vah idhar-udhar bhatakta he
 One day he falls asleep in the compound of the old temple of a small village with a group of sadhus and the next day a monk buries a yellow robber over Raju before he leaves the temple
 agle din gaanv kaa ek kisaan, bholaa, pitambar vastra main sote huye raju ko sadhu samaj letaa he
 Bhola's sister insisted not to marry
 bholaa use raju ke paas laata he or raju use samajha-bujhaakar shaadi ke liye raji kar letaa he
 Bhola becomes even more convinced that Raju is a monk
 vah yah baat saare gaanv main failaa detaa he
 The villagers consider him a saint and bring food and other gifts for him and also tell him their problems
 ab raju us gaanv main swami ji ke naam se janaa jane lagata he or gaanv ke panditon se uske matbhed bhi ho jate hai
 While narrating a story to the villagers, Raju tells them about a monk that once there was a famine in a village and that monk kept a fast for 12 days and it rained in that village
 sanyog se us gaanv ke ilaake main bhi akaal pad jaataa he
 a fool of the village listens to something else during a conversation with Raju and tells the villagers that Swamiji has decided to fast for 12 days for the rain
 raju pashopesh main pad jaataa he
 At first, Raju opposes it
 vah bholaa ko yahan tak bataata he ki vah ek sazaayaftaa mujrim he jise ek ladki ke kaaran sazaa mili he
 But still the villagers do not lose faith in him and he gives the example of the infamous bandit Ratnakar, who later became famous as Valmiki
 antat raju upwas ke liye raji ho jaataa he haalanki use vishwaas nahin hota ki manushya ke upwas rakhane main or varsha hone main koi sambandh he
 But during the fast, Raju's spiritual development takes place and his fame spreads far and wide
 hazaron kii sankhya main darshanaathi usase aashirwad lene aane lagate hai
 Hearing her fame, Rosie, her mother and her friend Ghafoor also visit him
 gaffoor ko bholaa mandir ke andar aane nahin detaa he kyonki vah duusare dharm kaa he
 Raju intervenes and says that his religion is humanity, love and philanthropy
 dhire-dhire raju kii haalat najuk hoti jaati he
 Finally it rains on the twelfth day but Raju dies
 jahaan ek ore mandir ke baahar gaanv vaale khushi se jhum rahe hai vahiin duusari ore mandir ke andar uske swajan uski mrityu kaa matam manaate hai
