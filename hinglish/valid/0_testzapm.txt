 is adhinium ko multah agast 1935 main paarit kiya gaya tha or ise us samay ke adhiniyamit sansad kaa sabase lanbaa adhinium kaha jaataa tha
 Because of its length, the Government of India Act 1935 was divided into two separate Acts in response: bhartiya raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik itihaas par sahitya main sandarbh ko aamtaur par bharat sarkaar 1935 adhinium ko sankshipt rup mana jaataa he, bajaay adhinium ke paath ke rup main mul rup se adhiniyamit karne ke liye The most important aspects of the Act were: haalanki, swaittata kii degree prantiy str kii shuruuaat mahatvapurn simaaon ke adheen tha: prantiy governor mahatvapurn arakshit shaktiyon ko barkaraar rakhaa or british adhikariyon ne bhi ek jimmedaar sarkaar ko nilambit adhikaar banaae rakhaa
 The demand for parts of the Act was to establish the Union of India but never came into operation due to opposition from the rulers of the princely states
 jab adhinium ke tahat pehla chunaav kaa aayojan hua tab adhinium kaa shesh bhaag 1937 main lagu hua
 Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the Indian people have consistently demanded a greater role in the government of their country
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british yuddh prayaason ke liye bharatiyon kaa yogadan karne kaa matlab tha ki british raajnneetik pratishthan ke adhik roodhiwaadee tatwon main sanvaidhanik parivartan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos karnaa or jiske parinamswaroop bharat sarkaar kaa 1919 adhinium
 is adhinium ne sarkaar ke ek nav pranali kii shuruuaat kii jise prantiy "dvishasan", ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, yani, kuch kshetron kii sarkaar ko prantiy vidhayika ke liye jimmedaar mantriyon ke haathon main rakhaa gaya jabaki anya ko british-niyukt prantiy governor ke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon ke haath main banaae rakhaa gaya
 While the Act was a reflection of the demand of Indians to play a larger role in government, it was also a reflection of British fears about what that role might mean in India's system
 dvishasan ke saath prayog asantoshjanak sabit hua
 a particular disappointment for Indian leaders was that in areas where they gained only nominal control, the "main authority" was in the hands of the British bureaucracy
 bharat kii sanvaidhanik vyavasthaaon kii samiksha kaa iraadaa kiya gaya tha or un rajasi rajyon jo ise sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar the
 However, a split between the Congress and the Muslim representatives proved to be the main factor to prevent the settlement as the system had significant knowledge of the Sangh's functioning
 vyavastha ke khilaaf, landan main nai kanjarvative prabhutv rashtriya sarkaar apane swayan ke prastaav ke masauda taiyaar karne ke saath aage aane kaa nirnay liya
 a joint parliamentary selection committee headed by Lord Linlithgow reviewed the White Paper to a great extent
 is white paper ke aadhaar par, bharat sarkaar ke bill kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Committee level and later bigotry was pacified, "security" strengthened and indirect elections for the Central Legislative Assembly were re-organized
 bill ko vidhivat agast 1935 main kanoon main paarit kiya gaya
 One consequence of this process is that, although the Government of India Act of 1935 should have gone a little further to meet Indian demands, both the expansion of the bill and the lack of Indian participation in its draft material meant that India The act proved to be radical for a significant element in Britain, while having the act with the best blunt response
 yadhyapi prastaavna ko shaamil karne ke liye british sansad ke adhiniyamon ke liye yah asaamaanya ho gai, bharat sarkaar ke adhinium 1935 se ek kii kami 1919 ke adhinium ke saath virodhabhas ho gai, jiske chalate bhartiya raajnneetik vikaas ke liye usase sambandhit us adhinium kaa uddeshy ke vyapak darshan ko sthapit kiya
 On 20 August 1917, the Preamble of the 1919 Act is quoted based on the statement of Edwin Montagu, Minister of India for the House of Commons, which promises: 


british samrajya ke ek abhinn hissaa ke rup main bharat main jimmedaar sarkaar kii pragatisheel prastuti ke liye ek darshan ke saath swayan-shaasi sanstha kaa dhire-dhaare vikaas he
 Indian demands with existing Dominions such as Canada and Australia now had to achieve constitutional parity in British India, which meant complete autonomy in the British Commonwealth
 british raajnneetik cirkil main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke kaaran shaq kiya ki bhartiya is aadhaar par unke desh ko chalaane main sakasham the or paryaapt "suraksha" ke saath, shaayad, kramik sanvaidhanik vikaas kii ek lambii avadhi ke baad ek uddeshy ke rup main dominian sthiti ko dekha
 This tension between them and the vision within the Indian and the British resulted in the clumsy agreement of the 1935 Act which had no preamble of its own, but the preamble of the 1919 Act replaced it, yet repealed the remnants of that act
 saamaanya rup se ise british se adhik mishrit sandeshon ke rup main bharat main dekha gaya, jo ki apane taraf se nirutsahi ravaiya ko sujhaati thi or bhartiya ichchhaaon ko santusht karne kii disha main "nunatam aavashyak" ke nikrushtatam drushtikon kaa suzav detii thi
 Unlike most modern constitutions, but common with Commonwealth constitutional law of the time, the Act did not incorporate the "bill of rights" within the new system that was intended to be established
 haalanki, bharat sangh ke prastaavit maamle main vahaan adhikaron ke ek set ko shaamil karne main kuch jatiltaayen thim, jaisaa ki nai ikai main nammaatr prabhutv rajasi rajyon shaamil the
 However a different view was considered by some and the draft outline constitution in the Nehru Report incorporated the bill's authority
 1947 main, adhinium main ek apekshaakrit kuch sanshodhano se bharat or pakistan ke antarim karyanvan samvidhan banaaya gaya
 The Act was not only extremely elaborate, but it was surrounded with a 'security standard', designed to enable the British Government to intervene whenever it was needed to maintain British responsibilities and interests
 is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke sansthaanon kii dhire-dhire bad rahi he bhartiyakaran ke chehre main, adhinium upyog ke liye nirnay or british niyukt vysarai ke haathon main suraksha upayon kii vaastavik prashasan or prantiy governron jo bharat ke liye rajya sachiv ke niyantran ke adheen tha
 'the vast powers and responsibilities that the Governor General must discipline according to his discretion or his personal decision, it is clear that he is expected to be like Superman
 uske paas vinamrata, saahas or kadi mehnat ke liye ek anant kshamta ke saath sampann hona chahie "hamane is bill main kai suraksha upayon ko daalaa he" sar robert horn ne kaha 


 "lekin ve saare suraksha upaay ek hi vyakti ke bare main vichaar karti he or vah he visarai he
 He is the lynch-pin of the entire system
 


 agar vysarai vifal hota he, kuch bhi aapke sthapit pranali ko bachaa nahin saktaa
 "this speech reflects the vision of the staunch Torridge who was frightened one day by the possibility of the Viceroy being appointed by the Labor Government
 adhinium ko thik se padhane se se pataa chalata he ki british sarkaar ne ise apane liye taiyaar kiya he, jab bhi unhen mahasoos hoga tab ve kisi bhi samay kanoonee upkaran ke saath is par puraa niyantran le sakate the
 However, doing so without any precise reason would have eroded their credibility with groups of India whose aim was to achieve the Act
 kuch visham vichaar: "in the federal government 


 has presented a glimpse of responsible government
 lekin vaastaviktaa kaa abhaav he, maamle ke anusaar raksha or videshi maamalon main jaruri shaktiyon kii kami he, rajyapal general ko aavashyak taur mantri gatividhi ke liye seemaa pradaan kii gai he or bhartiya rajyon ke pratinidhitiv ke upaay ko nakaaratmak pradaan kiya gaya he or yahaan tak ki loktantric niyantran kii shuruyaat kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 It would be of great interest to see the development of the creation of a highly specialized government; Certainly, if it operates successfully, the most credit will go to the political ability of Indian leaders who have faced more serious difficulties than colonial politicians who developed a system of self-government that is now Dominion level
 i am on a climax
 " Lord Lothian, in a forty-five minute long conversation, gave his views about this bill: "main aatmasamarpan kiye hue kattaro ke saath sahamat hum
 ve jise kisi bhi samvidhan kii aadat nahin he unhen koun si mahaan shaktiyon kaa upyog karnaa he, mahasoos nahin kar sakate hai
 If you look at this constitution, it would seem that all the powers are vested in the Governor General and the Governor
 lekin yahaan puri shakti raja main nihit nahin he? raja ke naam par sab kuch kiya jaataa he, lekin kya raja usamen kabhi hastkshep karata he? ek baar satta vidhayika ke haathon main aa jaati he, rajyapal yaa governor general kabhi hastkshep nahin karte hai

 ek baar ek niti nirdhaarit ho jaati he to ve ise vafadari or eemaandaaree se aage le jaaenge

 " Under the Act, UK resident British citizens and British companies registered in the UK should be treated like Indian nationals and companies registered in India unless UK law denies reciprocation

 It requires a fairly elaborate provision for the Viceroy to intervene if, in his appeal-disqualified view, any Indian law or act demands, or indeed, discrimination against, British subjects resident in Britain, British registered companies and, in particular, British Shipping interests
 "sanyukt samiti ne ek suzav ko vichaaradhin kiya jiske tahat videshi deshon ke saath vyapaar kaa vaanijya mantri dwaara kiya janaa chahie, lekin yah tay he ki videshi deshon ke saath sabhi vaartaon videsh karyaalay yaa videsh mantralay vibhaag dwaara yojit kiya janaa chahie kyonki ve britain main hai
 In this form of compromise, the Foreign Secretary always consulted the Board of Trade and it was assumed that the Governor General would consult the Commerce Minister in India in a manner

 haalanki, udaaravaadi or congress main bhi tatv kunkunepan ke saath ise jane ke liye taiyaar the: "linlithgow asked Sapru whether he thought the scheme of Act 1935 was a satisfactory option
 sapru ne kaha ki unhen adhinium ko teji se lagu karnaa chahie or sangheey yojana usamen sannihit he
 This was not an ideal, but it is the only one at this stage
 


 kuch dinon ke baad sapru, vysarai se milane birla aayaa tha
 He thought that the Congress was moving towards the Sangh's acceptance
 birla ne kaha ki kendra ke liye raksha or videshi maamle ke aarakshan ke dwaara gandhi isse zyada chintit nahin the lekin rajyon ke pratinidhiyon ko chunane ke tareeke par dhyaan de rahe the
 Birla wanted the Viceroy to help Gandhi in choosing certain kings towards the democratic election of the delegates
 


 Then Birla said that this is the only chance of agreement between the government and Congress and discussion between Gandhi and Viceroy is the best hope
 " The British government sent Lord Linlithgow as the new Viceroy to bring the Act into effect
 linlithgo kaaphi budhimaan, behad mehnatee, eemaandaar, gambhir or is adhinium ko safal banane ke liye drudh sankalp tha, haalanki vah bhi niras, aavegahin, vidhi sammat tha or apane tatkaal cirkil ke baahar logon ke saath "sharton ko lagu karnaa" bahut mushkil mahasoos kiya

 The plan to extend this train to Odisha's Bhubaneswar was strongly opposed by the passengers and political parties, because doing so would increase the duration of the journey of this train which would also change the arrival-departure time of this train, as Visakha Happened with the express

 Abhigyan Shakuntalam is a world-famous drama by Mahakavi Kalidas, which has been translated into almost all foreign languages
 isamen raja dushyant tathaa shakuntala ke pranay, vivaah, virah, pratyaakhyaan tathaa punarmilan kii ek sundar kahani he
 In the legend, Dushyant is realized by Akashvani, but in this drama the poet has made it known by Mudrika
 isaki naatakeeyata, iske sundar cathopakathan, isaki kavy-saundarya se bhari upmaayen or sthaan-sthaan par prayukt hui samyochit sukhtiyaan; or in sabase badhkar vividh prasangon kii dhvanyaatmakataa itani adbhut he ki in drushtiyon se dekhne par sanskrit ke bhi anya naatak abhigyaan shaakuntal se takkar nahin le sakate; phir anya bhashaaon kaa to kahana hi kya ! to yaheen sabase zyada acha he
 Kalidas did not choose Abhigyan Shakuntal's story as original
 yah katha mahabharat ke adiparv se lee gai he
 Thus the story of Shakuntala is also found in Padmapuran and it is more close to the story of Shakuntala than Mahabharata
 is kaaran vinternitz ne yah mana he ki shakuntala kii katha padmapurana se lee gai he
 But scholars have said that this part of Padmapurana was written after the creation of Shakuntala and later appears projectile
 mahabharat kii katha main durvasa ke shaap kaa ullekh nahin he
 The Mahabharata is very different from Dushyant, if not exactly the opposite
 mahabharat kii shakuntala bhi kalidas kii bhaanti salajj nahin he
 She narrates the story of her birth to Dushyant as a result of Vishwamitra and Maneka's relationship with her mouth
 mahabharat main dushyant shakuntala ke rup par mugdh hokar shakuntala se gandharv vivaah kii prarthana karata he; jis par shakuntala kahati he ki main vivaah is shart par kar sakati hum ki rajsinghaasana mere putr ko hi mili
 Dushyant at that time accepts and later returns to his capital and does not deliberately accept the shameful Shakuntala
 kalidas ne is prakaar aprishkrut rup main praapt hui katha ko apni kalpana se adbhut rup main nikhaar diya he
 By imagining the curse of Durvasa, he elevated the character of Dushyanta
 kalidas kii shakuntala bhi abhijatya, saundarya or karunaa kii murti he
 Apart from this, the manner in which Kalidas has performed the whole story, portraying emotions, etc
 is original and unique
 shakuntla raja dushyant kii patni thi jo bharat ke suprasiddh raja bharat kii mata or menka apsara kii kanya thi
 It is written in the Mahabharata that Shankutla was born from the womb of Maneka Apsara, who left it in the forest
 van main shankuton aadi ne hinsak pashuon se isaki raksha kii thi, isi se iskaa naam shakuntla padaa
 Kanva Rishi brought it out of the forest and kept it like a girl, keeping it in her ashram
 ek baar raja dushyant apane saath kuch sainikon ko lekar shikaar khilne nikle or ghoomte phirte kanv rishi ke ashram main pahunche
 The sage was not present there at that time; With this, the young woman Shakuntala welcomed King Dushyant
 usee avasar par donon main prem or phir gandharva vivaah ho gaya
 a few days later King Dushyant left his kingdom from there
 kanv muni jab lautakar aae, tab yah jaanakar bahut prasann hue ki shakuntla kaa vivaah dushyant se ho gaya
 Shakuntala was pregnant at that time
 samay paakar uske garbh se bahut hi balvan or tejasvi putr utpann hua, jiskaa naam 'bharat' rakhaa gaya
 It is said that the name 'bharat' was named after 'bharat'
 kuch dinon baad shakuntla apane putr ko lekar dushyant ke darbar main pahaunchi
 But Shakuntala had got the curse of Durvasa Rishi in the middle
 raja ne ise bilkul nahin pahachaanaa or spasht kah diya ki na to main tumhen jaanata hoon or na tumhen apane yahan aashray de saktaa hoon
 But on this occasion there was an All India Radio, which informed the king that this is my wife and this son is also mine
 unhen kanv muni ke ashram kii sab baaten samaran ho ain or unhone shakuntla ko apni pradhan rani banaakar apane yahan rakh liya
 'abhigyan Shakuntalam' mentions many touching episodes
 ek us samay, jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa pratham milan hota he
 Secondly, when Kanva leaves Shakuntala from her ashram for her husband's house
 us samay to swayan rishi kehete hai ki mere jaise rishi ko apni paalita kanya main yah moh he to jinaki oras putriyaan patigrih ke liye vidaa hoti hai us samay unki kya sthiti hoti hogi
 The third episode is Shakuntala's presence at Dushyant's meeting and Dushyant's refusal to recognize her
 chauthaa prasang he us samay kaa, jab machuaare ko praapt dushyant ke naam vaali anguthi usko dikhaai jaati he
 And the fifth episode of the union of dushyant-shakuntala in the ashram of Maarishi Maharishi
 shakuntala main kalidas kaa sabase bada chamatkaar uske dhvanyatmak sanketon main he
 In this, the poet has had a unique success in that he did not use any object anywhere
 koi bhi paatr, koi bhi cathope-kathan, koi bhi ghatana, koi bhi prakritik drishy nishprayojan nahin he
 All the events give a miraculous indication of the events ahead
 naatak ke prarambh main hi greeshm-varnan karte hue van-vaayu ke patal kii sugandhi se milakar sugandhit ho uthne or chaaya main letate hi neend aane lagane or diwas kaa ant romantic hone ke dwaara naatak kii katha-vastu kii mote taur par soochna de di gai he, jo kramshah pehle shakuntala or dushyant ke milan, uske baad neend-prabhaav se shakuntala ko bhul jane or naatak kaa ant sukhad hone kii suchak he
 Similarly, the initial song of the play by the illusors kissing the flowers of Shirish a little bit indicates that Dushyant and Shakuntala's union would be short-lived
 jab raja dhanush par baan chadaaye harin ke peeche daude ja rahe hai, tabhi kuch tapasvi aakar rokte hai
 It is said - 'maharaj' this is the stag of the ashram, do not shoot arrows at it
 ’ yahaan harin ke atirikt shakuntala kii ore bhi sanket he, jo harin ke samaan hi bholi-bhali or asahaay he
 'whereas the very fickle life of the stag and the hard arrow like your thunderbolt!' It also has a poignant indication of Shakuntala's helplessness and simplicity and the ruthlessness of the king
 jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa prem kuch or badhane lagata he, tabhi nepathy se pukaar sunai padati he ki ‘tapasviyo, ashram ke praaniyon kii raksha ke liye taiyaar ho jaao
 The hunter king Dushyant has come here
 ’ isamen bhi dushyant ke haathon se shakuntala kii raksha kii ore sanket kiya gaya prathit hota he, parantu yah sanket kisi ke bhi kaan main sunai nahin diya; shakuntala ko kisi ne nahin bachaaya
 This increases the compassion of the situation even more
 chauthe ank ke praarambhik bhaag main kanv ke shishy ne prabhaat kaa varnan karte hue sukh or dukh ke nirantar saath lage rahane kaa tathaa priy ke viyog main striyon ke asay dukh kaa jo ullekh kiya he, vah dushyant dwaara shakuntala kaa parityag kiye jane ke liye pehle se hi prishthbhumi-si bana detaa he
 In the fifth issue, Rani Hanspadika sings a song, in which the king is praised for his sweet-heartedness
 dushyant bhi yah sweekaar karte hai ki unhone hansapadika se ek hi baar prem kiya he
 This gives the poet a serious indication that even though Shakuntala was forgotten by Dushyant because of Durvasa's curse, it was not new for him to ignore the queens once they were in love
 anya raniyaan bhi uski is madhukar-vritti kaa shikaar thim
 The incident of Shakuntala's abandonment seems even more cruel and harsh in the backdrop of this song from Hansapadika
 isi prakaar ke dhvanyatmak sanketon se kalidas ne saatven ank main dushyant, shakuntala or uske putr ke milane ke liye sukhad prishthbhumi taiyaar kar di he
 Indra King confers uncommon respect to Dushyant
 uske baad hemkut parvat par prajapati ke ashram main pahunchate hi raja ko anubhav hone lagata he ki jaise vah amrit ke sarovar main snaan kar rahe hon
 After such signs, the union of Dushyant and Shakuntala becomes even more delightful
 german kavi gete ne abhigyaan shaakuntalan ke bare main kaha tha- Similarly, this verse is famous among Sanskrit scholars- iskaa arth he - kavy ke jitne bhi prakaar hai unamem naatak vishesh sundar hota he
 In plays also, Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top in terms of poetry
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 His fourth verse in Abhigyan Shakuntalam and fourth verse in this issue is very delightful
 abhigyaan shaakuntal main naatakeeyata ke saath-saath kavy kaa ansh bhi yathesht maatra main he
 Shringar is the main juice in it; And its coincidence and disconnection have matured beautifully on both sides
 iske atirikt hasya, vir tathaa karun ras kii bhi jahaan-tahaan acchhee abhivyakti hui he
 Beautiful and enchanting expectations from place to place not only amazes the reader, but also helps in increasing the intensity of the desired emotion
 saare naatak main kalidas ne apni upamaaon or utprekshaon kaa upyog kahin bhi keval alankaar-pradarshan ke liye nahin kiya
 Their simile or catalysis at each place has helped in making the expression of meaning juicy
 kalidas apni upamaaon ke liye sanskrit-sahitya main prasiddh hai
 In Shakuntal too, his power to choose the appropriate simile was well known
 shakuntala ke vishay main ek jagah raja dushyant kehete hai ki ‘vah aisa phool he, jise kisi ne suungha nahin he; aisa navpallav he, jis par kisi ke nakhon kii kharonch nahin lagi; aisa ratna he, jisamen chhed nahin kiya gaya or aisa madhu he, jiskaa swaad kisi ne chakhaa nahin he
 'through these similes, a unique glimpse of Shakuntala's beauty comes before our eyes
 isi prakaar paanchaven ank main dushyant shakuntala kaa parityag karte hue kehete hai ki ‘he tapaswini, kya tum vaise hi apane kul ko kalankit karnaa or mujhe patit karnaa chaahati ho, jaise tat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi tat ke vriksh ko to giraati hi he or apane jal ko bhi malin kar leti he
 'upma, given here by the river flowing through the river of Shakuntala, is particularly helpful in expressing the king's mood
 isi prakaar jab kanv ke shishy shakuntala ko saath lekar dushyant ke paas pahunchate hai to dushyant kii drushti un tapasviyon ke bich main shakuntala ke upar jaakar padati he
 By not giving a detailed description of Shakuntala's beauty there, the poet has only said to her mouth that 'who is that veiled beauty among these ascetics, which looks like a new spring in the midst of yellow leaves
 ’ is choti-si upama ne pile pattey or konpal kii sadrishyata ke dwaara shakuntala ke soundarya kaa puraa hi chitrankan kar diya he
 Similarly, looking at Sarvadamana, Dushyant says that 'this majestic child appears like the fire that is burning, looking for fuel to become a blazing fire
 ’ is upama se kalidas ne na keval balak kii tejaswita prakat kar di, balki yah bhi spasht rup se suchit kar diya he ki yah balak bada hokar mahapratapi chakravarti samraat banegaa
 Many examples of such delightful similes can be given from Shakuntal because 180 similes have been used in Shakuntal
 or unamem se sabhi ek se ek badhkar hai
 It is fine that Kalidas had special skill in the choice of Upma and it is also true that some of his beautiful analogies are rare in the compositions of other poets, yet Kalidasa's biggest feature is not upma-kaushal
 upama-kaushal to unke kavy-kaushal kaa ek saamaanya-sa ang he
 Kalidas knows many methods to express his mood or to perfect a rasa or to awaken the intense feeling of an emotion
 shabdon kaa prasangochit chayan, abhisht bhav ke upyukt chand kaa chunaav or vyanjana-shakti kaa prayog karke kalidas ne apni style ko vishesh rup se romantic bana diya he
 Where Kalidas has descended on Shakuntala's aesthetic narrative, he has not satisfied by merely drawing the form of Shakuntala by similes and incantations
 pehle-pehle to unhone keval itnaa kahalwaya ki ‘yadi tapovana ke nivaasiyon main itnaa rup he, to samajho ki van-lataaon ne udyaan kii lataaon ko maat kar diya
 Then he told Dushyant's face that 'it is like to plant such a beautiful girl in the rules of the ashram, like cutting the acacia tree from the petals of Neel Kamal
 ’ uske baad kalidas kehete hai ki ‘shakuntala kaa rup aisa manohar he ki bhale hi usne motaa valkal vastra pahana hua he, phir usase bhi uskaa saundarya kuch gata nahin, balki badha hi he
 Because whatever is given to a beautiful person becomes his ornament
 ’ uske baad raja shakuntala kii sukumaar deh kii tulana hari-bhari phulon se ladi lata ke saath karte hai, jisase us vilakshan saudarya kaa swaroop pathak kii ankhon ke saamne chitrit-sa ho uthta he
 After this, Kalidasa has brought a bhramar to bring that beauty to the climax; Who considers the face of Shakuntala as a beautiful blossoming flower and hovers over it to make it juicy
 is prakaar kalidas ne shakuntala ke saundarya ko chitrit karne ke liye anlakaaron kaa sahaara utana nahin liya, jitna ki vyanjanashkti kaa; or yah vyajana-shakti hi kavy kii jaan maani jaati he

 a digital camera is a camera that takes video or still photographs in digital form, or both, and records pictures through an electronic image sensor

 Compact cameras are generally designed in such a way that they are easy to use, provide a wide variety of features and have a high quality of photos, compact and simple; Generally, its images can only be stored using lossy compression

 digital single-lens riflex camera, ek prakaar kaa digital camera hi he jo film single-lens riflex camera par aadhaarit hota he
 They derive their name from their unique display system which consists of a mirror that reflects light from the lens through a separate optical viewfinder
 chitra ko capchar karne ke uddeshy se darpan apane maarg se hat jaataa he jisase prakaash ke imager par padane main aasaani hoti he
 Since light cannot reach the imager during framing, autofocus is implemented using specific sensors in the mirror box
 21veen sadi ke adhikansh DSLR camaron main bhi ek "live vyuu" mod hota he jo chayan karne par compact camaron kii live purvavlokan pranali ko uttejit kar data he
 Sensors of these cameras are much larger than other types of cameras, whose diagonals typically range from 18 mm to 36 mm
 yah unhen utkrisht nimna-prakaash pradarshan, ek pradutt chhidr main kam gaharaai vaala kshetra or ek bada aakaar pradaan karata he
 They use interchangeable lenses; Each major DSLR manufacturer also sells a wide variety of lenses that are manufactured specifically with the idea of using them in their cameras
 isse upyogkarta ko anuprayog: wide-angal, telephoto, nimna-prakaash ityadi ke liye dizin kiye gaye sabase upyukt lens kaa chayan karne main aasaani hoti he
 Therefore each lens does not require its own shutter behind the mirror as the DSLR uses a focal-plane shutter in front of the imager
 pradarshan ke samay darpan ke apane maarg se hatane par ek vishesh prakaar kii katakataane kii awaz sunai detii he
 In late 2008, a new type of camera was introduced in which interchangeable lenses and larger sensors from DSLR cameras were added, either through an electronic viewfinder or on the rear LCD, to the live preview system of compact cameras
 darpan box ko hataa die jane ke kaaran ye DSLR camaron kii tulana main adhik saral or adhik compact hote hai or ye aam taur par yaa to DSLR camaron yaa phir compact camaron ke sanchaalan or kaary-kshamta ko uttejit kar detaa he
 As of 2009 the only such system is the Micro Four Thirds, whose components are derived from the Four Thirds DSLR system
 rangefinder, ek upyogkarta-sanchalit optical pranali he jiskaa prayog vastuon kii duuri maapne ke liye kiya jaataa he jo kabhi film camaron main prayukt hota tha
 Most digital cameras measure the distance of an object automatically using acoustic or electronic technology, but it is not fair to say that they have a rangefinder
 rangefinder sangya kaa matlab kabhi-kabhi rangefinder camera bhi hota he, arthath, vah film camera jo rangefinder se las hota he jo un SLR yaa saadhaaran camaron se alag hota he jisamen duuri maapne kii kshamta nahin hoti he
 a line-scan camera is a camera device that consists of a line-scan image sensor chip and a focusing mechanism
 in camaron kaa prayog praayah keval audyogic sthanon main chalyman vastu ke nirantar pravaah ke chitra ko lene ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Unlike video cameras, line-scan cameras use a array of pixel sensors instead of their metrics
 line-scan camere ke data main ek frequency hoti he jiske antargat camera, kisi line ko scan karne, intazaar karne or dohraane kaa kaary karata he
 Line-scan camera data is usually processed by a computer to collect one-dimensional line data and create a two-dimensional image
 The data of the collected two-dimensional images is then processed through an image-processing process to serve industrial purposes
 line-scan praudyogiki main data ko ati-teevr gati se or bahut zyada image rizolushans par capchar karne kii kshamta hoti he
 Typically under these conditions, the resulting stored image data immediately exceeds the 100 MB limit in a few seconds

 When digital cameras became common, many photographers had the same question as to whether their film cameras could be converted to digital
 iskaa jawaab tha - haa or nahin
 adhikansh 35 mm film camaron ke liye jawaab he - nahin, kyonki is par phir se kaam karne kii aavashyaktaa hogi or isaki laagat bhi bahut zyada hogi, khaas taur par lenson ke saath-saath camaron ko viksit karne main bahut zyada kaam karnaa hoga or isaki laagat bhi bahut zyada hogi

 The camera weighed 8 pounds, recorded black and white images on a cassette tape, had a resolution of 0
01 megapixels, and in December 1975 it took 23 seconds to take its first image
 The prototype camera was a technology effort not intended for production

 US government agencies also showed keen interest in this concept of still video, particularly by the US Navy, which wanted to use it as a specialized air-to-sea surveillance system
 sabase pehla analog camera, canan RC-250 zapashot ho saktaa he jo 1988 main vipanan ke madhyam se upabhoktaaon tak pahunchaa
 That year a notable analog camera called the Nikon QV-1000C was produced which was designed as a press camera and was not offered for sale to ordinary users, selling only a few hundred units
 It recorded images in grayscale and its quality in newspaper-print was similar to film cameras

 The creation of the first JPEG and MPEG standard formats in 1988 made it possible to create digital formats that enabled them to compress to store images and video files
 The first consumer camera with a liquid crystal display at the rear was introduced in 1995 as the Casio QV-10 and the first camera to use compactflash was the Kodak DC-25 in 1996

 In 1999 a 2
74 megapixel camera called the Nikon D1 arrived, which was the first fully developed digital SLR by a major manufacturer and initially cost less than $ 6,000, which was cheaper for professional photographers and high-end consumers
 is camere main nicon F-mount lenson kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya tha jiskaa matlab tha ki film photographer, isi tarah ke kai lenson kaa prayog kar sakate the jo unke paas pehle se hi thi
 The resolution of a digital camera is often limited by the camera's sensor, which in traditional photography relocates the film's work and converts light into discrete signals
 sensor, lakhon "backet" se milakar bana hota he jo jaruri taur par photon kii sankhya ko ginaney kaa kaam karata he jo sensor ko prabhavit karata he
 This means that the brighter the image at the specified point of the sensor, the higher the value that is presented for that pixel
 sensor ke bhautik sanrachana ke aadhaar par, ek rang filter sarini kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he jiske liye ek demosicing / antarveshan kalanvidhi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The number of resulting pixels in the image determines its "pixel count"
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek 640x480 chitra main 307,200 pixel yaa lagbhag 307 kilopixel hoga; ek 3872x2592 chitra main 10,036,224 pixel yaa lagbhag 10 megapixel honge
 Only pixel counts are generally considered an indication of a camera's resolution but this is a misconception
 aise kai kaarak hai jo sensor ke rizolushan ko prabhavit karte hai
 Some of these factors include - the size of the sensor, the quality of the lens, and the formation of pixels
 Many digital compact cameras have been criticized for having too many pixels
 sensor, itane chote ho sakate hai ki unke 'backet', aasaani se unhen paripurna kar sakate hai; badale main, sensor kaa rizolushan apekshaakrit bada ho saktaa he jo camere ke lens se shaayad hi praapt ho
 As technology has improved, the cost has also decreased dramatically

 The estimation of the estimated prices of the cameras was first presented by Barry Hendy at the 1998 Australian PMA DIMA Conference, and has since been referred to as "hendy's Law"
 chunki aam taur par keval kuch-ek pahalu anupaaton kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he isliye sensor ke upyogi aakaaron kii sankhya simit hoti he
 Furthermore, sensor-makers do not manufacture every possible sensor size but take the necessary steps to increase the sizes

vyavsaayik taur par digital camaron main prayukt sensoron kii saarini nimnlikhit he: Since the introduction of digital back, the main three methods have been used to capture images, each based on the hardware configuration of sensors and color filters
 pehali vidhi ko praayah single-shot kehete hai, jo camere ke lens se hokar guzarane vaale prakaash ke samaksh camere ke sensor ke pradarshit hone kii sankhya se sambandhit he
 Single-shot capture systems either use a CCD with a bare filter mosaic or use three different image sensors that are exposed to the same image through a beam splitter
 duusari vidhi ko multi-shot ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he kyonki sensor, lens-chhidr ke teen yaa teen se adhik chhidr-mukhon ke ek kram main chitra ke samaksh pradarshit hota he
 There are several methods of application of multi-shot technique
 mul rup se sabase saadhaaran vidhi ke antargat, yogtmak rang kii jaankaree praapt karne ke liye krmanusaar sensor ke saamne se guzare teen filtaron vaale ek ekal image sensor kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Another method of multiple shot is called microscanning
 is takaneeq ke antargat bear filter vaale ek ekal CCD ko upyog main laayaa jaataa he lekin vastav main sensor chip kii bhautik sthiti ko lens ke fokas plane par sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he taaki ise ek adhik rizolushan vaale chitra ke saath "stitch" kiya ja sake nahin to CCD ko karyanvit kiya jaataa
 in donon vidhiyon ko milakar ek tisare sanskaran kaa nirmaan kiya gaya jisamen chip par bear filter kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 The third method is called scanning because the sensor moves across the entire focal plane in much the same way that a desktop scanner's sensor operates
 unke rekhiy yaa trirekhiy sensoron main photocensor kii keval ek shrenee yaa teen rangon ke liye teen shreniyon ko upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 In some cases, scanning is performed by running sensors, for example, using color co-site sampling or rotating the entire camera; a digital rotating line camera provides high-resolution images
 kisi pradutt capchar ke liye vidhi kaa chayan mukhyat: vishay-vastu dwaara nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 It is usually inappropriate to try to capture an object that moves with something rather a single-shot system
 haalanki, ucch rang nishtha or bade aakaar ke fil or multi-shot kii sahaayta se uplabdh rizolushan or scan karne vaale peeche ke hisse, steshnari vastuon or bade aakaar ke formet vaale photographon ke saath kaam karne ke liye vyavsaayik photographeron ke liye inhen aakarshak bana dete hai
 Incidental advances in single-shot cameras and processing of raw image files in the early 21st century led to the creation of single-shot and ccd-based cameras that had complete hegemony in almost every field, even in the field of high-end commercial photography
 
 cmos-aadhaarit single shot camere kuch had tak saamaanya bane rahe
 The latest consumer digital cameras use a Bayer filter mosaic, and an anti-optical degradation filter is used to reduce the degradation caused by the disjoint sampling of individual primary-color images
 RGB a demosaicing algorithm is used to interpolate color information to create a complete table of image data
 jin camaron main beam-filter single-shot 3CCD drushtikon, thri-filter multi-shot drushtikon, color ko-site namoonay yaa fovian X3 sensor kaa prayog hota he, un camaron main na to upghaton-virdohi filtaron kaa or na hi demosicing kaa prayog hota he
 The camera firmware or software from a RAW converter program, such as Adobe Camera RAW, interprets the RAW data of the sensor to obtain a full color image as the RGB color model has three dominant values: red, green, and blue for each pixel
 Requires one value each
 a single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three dominant values and therefore each pixel To filter new selectively to a particular color, you must use a color filter array
 bear filter pattern, prakaash filtaron kaa ek aavritimulak 2×2 mosek pattern he jisamen hare vaale ko vipareet kinaaron main or laal evam nile vaale ko anya do sthanon main pratisthapit kiya jaataa he
 The majority of green takes advantage of the characteristics of the human visual system that determines greater green brightness and is more sensitive to brightness than hue or saturation
 kabhi-kabhi 4 rangon vaale filter pattern kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jisamen praayah do alag-alag hare rang hote hai
 This probably provides more accurate color, but requires a slightly more complex interpolation process

 Loss of camera battery can also be avoided during the download process by using a card reader as the device receives power or power from a USB port
 ek bahari card reader kii sahaayta se bhandaaran madhyam ke sangrah se chitron ko sidhe abhigamit karne main suvidha hoti he
 But if only one storage card is in use, moving it back and forth between the camera and the reader can cause inconvenience

 CR2 and CR-V3 batteries are based on lithium and manufactured with the idea of single use
 unhen aam taur par camecorderon main bhi dekha gaya he
 AA batteries are the most commonly used batteries; However, non-rechargeable alkaline batteries supplied with low-level cameras are capable of providing sufficient power for only a short period of time in most cameras
 ve un camaron main santoshjanak rup se seva pradaan kar sakati hai jinhen sirf kabhi-kabhaar prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Consumers who need to use multiple times more often than not, they use AA Nickel Metal Hybrid) batteries that provide adequate amounts of power and are also rechargeable
 NIMH batariyaan, utani shakti pradaan nahin karti hai jitani kii lithium aayan vaali batariyaan, karti hai or jab unka prayog nahin hota hai tab ve discharge bhi ho jaati hai
 They are available in various ampere-hour or milli-ampere-hour ratings, which also affect the time frame in which it is used
 khaas taur par madhya-range vaale upabhokta model or kuch nimna-stareey camaron main of-da-shelf badariyon kaa prayog hota he; keval kuch DSLR camere hi unhen sweekaar karte hai 
 richargeble RCR-V3 lithium-aayan batariyaan, non-richargeble CR-V3 badariyon ke ek vikalp ke rup main bhi uplabdh hai
 Another type of battery for digital cameras is the proprietary battery format
 inhen nirmaataa ke custom vinirdeshon ke liye banaaya jaataa he or ye yaa to vipanan ke baad ke pratisthapit hisse yaa phir OEM ho sakati hai
 Almost all proprietary batteries are lithium ion

 He could not kill Harry with his current wand because the axes of his and Harry's wand were the same, so after Lucius Melfoy failed to kill Harry with a stick, he would search for the world's most powerful stick Elder wand
 So that he can overcome Harry's wand and become invincible

 Frustrated with all these developments, Meropi starts wandering the streets of London

 After Rolling regained his body in the fourth edition of the novel, Voldemort was left with pale skin, a white face like a chalice, a snake-like nasal cavity, a red-eyed and cat-like gullible, skeleton-like body, and unnaturally long fingers
 He is shown with big and thin hands

 According to the stories seen by Smriti Patra in the past in the second and sixth editions, he was beautiful and tall with pale skin, jet black hair and dark brown eyes
 vah apane luk se sabhi ko aakarshith kar saktaa tha
 It is speculated that the reason for his becoming a human being was to divide his soul into a Horcrux in his desire to become immortal
 film main voldemort kii aankhe neeli tathaa pupil golakaar he
 Rolling describes Voldemort as "the worst wizard of hundreds of years"
 unhone use "atyadhik manorogi, anya logon kii pidaa par manushyik pratikriya kaa abhavi" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 At the same time, he has been shown to be the slayer of others, especially the Maghuls, because of his happiness
 uske andar chetana kaa abhaav tha, vah apane kiye par use koi pachhtaawaa nahin hota tha tathaa vah apane atirikt insaaniyat kaa mahatva bhi nahin samajhataa tha
 He neither liked to establish companionship or friendship with man nor did he have any love or affection for anyone
 vah swayan ko shreshth samajhataa tha or apane saamne sabhi ko hin maanata tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was "a truly starving, racist of incredible strength"
 agar vah khwaish darpan main dekhtaa to vah swayan ko "sarvashaktimaan or avinashi" ke rup main dekhtaa jaisaa vah chahta tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was born as a result of a love decoction by his mother and sorceress Meropi Gaunt on a Magaloo and his father Tom Riddle, a result of a failed love

 The attraction that led to the transformation of the boy born as Tom Riddle to Voldemort is very necessary because it shows the concept that led to this character
 lagbhag sabhi khalnaayakon ke samaan, voldemort kaa dambh hi uske patan kaa kaaran banataa he
 He was extremely afraid of death, which he described as a shameful and disgusting human weakness
 uske andar ahamkaari hone ke kai lakshan the
 In front of his life-worshipers, Voldemort confesses that he paid the great price for the attack on Harry's parents, and then observes what went wrong, and in the end he takes the blame on himself
 rolling ne yah likhaa he ki uskaa bahurupia uski antim yatra hoti
 Rolling states the difference between Voldemort and Harry, stating that Harry had accepted death, for this reason he eventually emerged stronger than he was
 puri shrunkhlaa main rolling ne voldemort ko atyadhik shaktishaalee, budhimaan or nirmam dusht jaadugar bataaya he
 He could read others' minds well and also prevent others from entering his own mind

 Voldemort feared Dumbledore, the only magician
 antim pustak main voldemort ko bina kisi sahare ke udata dikhaaya gaya, jisane bhi yah padhaa yaa dekha vah achambhit rah gaya
 Like his ancestors, he could also talk to snakes in snake language

 The Gaunt family also used this language in their own conversation

 When Voldemort attempts to assassinate the newborn Harry, Harry's art of speaking in snake language along with part of his soul also goes away
 jab vah aatma kaa hissaa harry main mar jaataa he to harry main yah shakti khatm ho jaati he
 While watching an old story in the sixth part, Voldemort claimed during a job interview in front of Dumbledore that he had "increased the limits of magic more than ever"
 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort kii jaadui gyaan kisi bhi jivit jaadugar se bahut adhik he or yahan tak ki voldemort ke puri shakti ke saath lautne par uske mantron ke saamne dambldor ke paas sabase taqatvar bachaav mantra hone kaa gyaan bhi aparyaapt hoga
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort is probably the smartest student of Hogwarts

 Vishnu did not realize this due to Shiva's illusion
 ek phool kam paakar bhagwaan vishnu use dhundne lage
 But the flower was not found
 tab vishnu ne ek phool kii purti ke liye apana ek netra nikaalkar shiv ko arpit kar diya
 Seeing the devotion of Vishnu, Lord Shankar was very pleased and appeared in front of Shrihari and asked for a boon
 tab vishnu ne daityon ko samaapt karne ke liye ajey shastr kaa vardaan maanga
 Lord Shankar then bestowed the Sudarshan Chakra to Vishnu
 vishnu ne us chakra se daityon kaa sanhaar kiya
 In this way, the gods were liberated from the demons and the Sudarshan Chakra became associated with their form forever
 bhagwaan vishnu or shrikrishna ne is chakra se anek rakshason kaa vadh kiya tha
 Lord Vishwakarma's daughter was married to Lord Surya
 shaadi ke baad bhi unki beti khush nahin thi, kaaran, surya kii garmi or unka taap jiske kaaran wo apana vaivaahik jivan nahin ji paa rahi thi, or phir beti ke kehane par bhagwaan ne surya se thodi si chamak or taap le ke puspak vimaan kaa nirmaan kiya
 Along with this, he created the trident of Lord Shiva and the Sudarshan Chakra of Lord Vishnu
 pracheen or pramanik shastron main aisi manyata he ki iskaa nirmaan bhagwaan shankar ne kiya tha
 After construction Lord Shiva handed it over to Sri Vishnu
 sudarshan chakra bhagwaan vishnu ko kaise praapt hua, is vishay main ek katha prachlit he, jo is prakaar he- In ancient times, there was a Brahmin named ‘vetamanyu’
 vah vedon ke gyaata the
 He had a wife named Atreyi, who was virtuous
 unhen log 'dharmshila' ke naam se bhi bulaate the
 This Brahmin couple had a son, named 'upamanyu'
 parivaar behad nirdhantaa main pal rahaa tha
 Poverty was such that Dharmashila could not even give milk to her son
 vah balak doodh ke swaad se anbhigya tha
 Dharmashila used to give him rice milk as milk
 ek din rishi vitmanyu apane putr ke saath kahin pritibhoj main gayi
 Upamanyu ate a milk pudding made of milk, then he came to know the real taste of milk
 ghar aakar usne chaaval ke dhovan ko pine se inkaar kar diya
 To get milk, his mother Dharmasheela said to the boy stubbornly, "son, if you want to drink milk more affluent and flavored than what, then serve Virupaksha Mahadev
 unki krupa se amrit bhi praapt ho saktaa he
 "upamanyu asked his mother-" Mother, who are the deformed women you are asking to serve? " dharmshila ne apane putr ko bataaya ki pracheen kaal main sridama naam se vikhyath ek mahaan asur raaj tha
 He subdued the whole world and subdued Lakshmi as well
 uske yash or pratap se teenon lok shrihin ho gayi
 His values had increased so much that he started making plans to take away the Shreevats of Lord Vishnu
 us mahabalashali asur kii is dooshit manobhaavna ko jaanakar use maarane kii ichha se bhagwaan vishnu maheshwar shiv ke paas gayi
 At that time Maheshwar was yogic on the high peak of the Himalayas
 tab bhagwaan vishnu jagannatha ke paas jaakar ek hajaar varsh tak pair ke anguuthe par khadey rah kar parabrahm kii upasna karte rahe
 Pleased with Lord Vishnu's rigorous practice thus, Lord Shiva bestowed upon him the 'sudarshan Chakra'
 unhone sudarshan chakra ko dete hue bhagwaan vishnu se kaha- "devesh! yah sudarshan naam kaa shreshth aayudh baarah aron, chah nabhiyon evam do yugon se yukt, teevr gatisheel or samast ayudhon kaa naash karne vaala he
 To protect the gentlemen, its arrows have twelve months ranging from gods, zodiacs, seasons, Agni, Soma, Mitra, Varuna, Shachipati Indra, Visvadeva, Prajapati, Hanuman, Dhanvantari, Tapa and Chaitra to Falgun
 aap ise lekar nirbhik hokar shatruon kaa sanhaar karen
 Then Lord Vishnu defeated and killed Asura Sridama in battle with that Sudarshan Chakra
 is aayudh kii khaasiyat thi ki ise teji se haath se ghumaane par yah hawa ke pravaah se mil kar prachand veg se agni prajjwalit kar dushman ko bhasma kar detaa tha
 It was a very beautiful, fast-moving, fast-moving weapon
 bhagwaan shri krishna ke paas yah devi kii krupa se aayaa
 It was made of silver spiers
 isaki upree or nichali satahon par louh shul lage hue the
 Along with this, a very toxic type of toxin, which was kept in two-pointed sharp knives, was also used
 iske naam se hi vipakshi sena main maut kaa bhay chaa jaataa tha

 An aristocracy is a regime in which political power is in the hands of the elite
 is sandarbh main "abhijan" kaa arth he kuleen, vidwaan, sadguni, utkrisht
 In the West, "aristocracy" also means the same
 afalaatoon or uske shishy arestu ne apni pustakon main aristacraisi ko budhimaan, sadguni vyaktiyon kaa shashantantr mana he
 The mention of aristocracy is often found in the history of many countries
 vidwaanon kaa mat he ki bharat main bhi pracheen kaal main kuch abhijatatantr the
 The ideal city system described in Aflatun's well-known book "republic" is the aristocracy of omniscient philosophers
 in darshanikon ke liye afalaatoon ne kautumbik or sampatti sambandhi samyawad kii vyavastha kii he
 Monarchy has also sometimes been considered an aristocracy in the history of statehood
 iske do kaaran hai
 First, in both, the government is not in the hands of one person or all adult citizens, but in the hands of a few people
 duusare, kuch kaa mat he ki dhansanchay charatrivan hi kar sakate hai or is prakaar vah sadgun kii abhivyakti he
 Many modern sociologists are of the opinion that even in monarchy and democracy, sovereignty is actually in the hands of a few individuals
 raja ko shashan sanchaalan ke liye chatur raajnneetigyon kii sahaayta par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 Even in a democracy, the general public is not interested in politics, it is following
 shashan kii bagdor janatantr main bhi chatur raajnneetigyon ke hi haath main hoti hai or ve dhani hote hai
 Those who are involved in the real political process, they are clever, they are the same politicians, their coin runs in administration and political bandit
 kintu abhijan kii niyukti kaise ho? yadi jananirvachan dwaara, to vah ek prakaar kaa janatantr he
 If in any other way, elite regimes become narrow, selfish, devious and money-rich and cannot keep their capacity in line with the changed situation
 aaj janatantr or abhijatatantr kii pramukh samasya yahi he ki kisi prakaar rajya main dhan ke vriddhishil prabhaav kaa niraakaran ho or jansadharan budhimhan sevaparayan vyaktiyon ko apana shaasha nirvaachit karen

 It is also called Bhojpur temple
 yah mandir betwa nadi ke tat par vindhya parvatamalaon ke madhya ek pahari par sthit he
 The temple was built and its Shivling was established by the famous Paramara king Bhoj of Dhar
 unke naam par hi ise bhojpur mandir yaa bhojeshwar mandir bhi kaha jaataa he, haalaanki kuch kinvadantiyon ke anusaar is sthal ke mul mandir kii sthapana pandvon dwaara kii gai maani jaati he

 The large work plan of this imperfect temple has been engraved on the nearby stone rocks
 in maanchitr arekhon ke anusaar yahan ek vrahat mandir parisar banane kii yojana thi, jisamen dheron anya mandir bhi banaaye jane the
 After its successful completion, this temple complex would have been one of the largest temple complexes in India
 mandir parisar ko bhartiya puraatatva surveykshan vibhaag dwaara rashtriya mahatva kaa smarak chihnit kiya gaya he va iskaa punaruddhar kaary kar ise phir se vahi rup dene kaa safal prayaas kiya he
 According to the inscription of the Archaeological Department located outside the temple, the Shiva lingam of this temple is the tallest and largest Shivalinga in the temples of India
 is mandir kaa praveshdwar bhi kisi hindu bhawan ke daravaajon main sabase bada he
 An archaeological museum dedicated to this temple is also built near the temple
 shivaratri ke avasar par rajya sarkaar dwaara yahaan prativarsh bhojpur utsav kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 According to this opinion, to worship Lord Shiva by Mother Kunti, the Pandavas resolved to complete the construction of this temple in one night which could not be completed
 is prakaar yah mandir aaj tak adhuraa he
 According to this belief, it is believed that the temple was built by the great patron of art, architecture and learning in the 11th century by Bhojdev, the Parmar dynasty king of central India
 paramparaon evam manyatanusaar unhone hi bhojpur evam ab tut chuke ek baandh kaa nirmaan bhi karavaaya tha
 The construction of the temple was never completed, so there is a lack of a foundation stone or a stone marking the opening / construction
 phir bhi yahaan kaa naam bhojpur hi he jo raja bhoj ke naam se hi judaa hua he
 According to some beliefs, this temple was to be built in one night, but its roofing work was done in the morning before completion, so the work remained incomplete
 raja bhoj dwaara nirmaan kii manyata ko sthal ke shilpon se bhi samarthan miltaa he, jinaki carbon aayu-gananaa inhen 11veen shatabdi kaa hi sunishchit karti he
 In a nearby Jain temple of Bhojpur, which has the identity marks of the same craftsmen, who are built on this Shiva temple; Only the date of construction of 1035 AD is inscribed on them
 kai saahitiyik kaaryon ke alaava, yahaan ke aitihaasik sakshya bhi varsh 1035 i main raja bhoj ke shashan kii pushti karte hai
 Modas Tamra Patra issued by Raja Bhoj, Chintamani Saranika composed by his royal poet Dasabal etc
 are helpful for this confirmation
 is mandir ke nikatavartti kshetra main kabhi teen baandh tathaa ek sarovar hua karte the
 Only such a powerful king could build such a large lake and three big barriers
 ye sabhi sakshya is mandir ke raja bhoj dwaara nirmaan karawaaye jane ke paksh main dikhaai dete hai
 Archaeologist Prokirit Mankodi describes the construction period of this temple as late as the reign of King Bhoja, around the middle of 11th century
 udaipur prashasti main baad ke parmaar shaskaon dwaara likhvaaye gaye shilalekhon main aisa ullekh miltaa he jinamein: mandiron se bhar diya jaise vaakyansh hai, evam shiv se sambandhit tathyon ko samarpit he
 The description of Kedareshwar, Rameshwar, Somnath, Kalabhairava and Rudra is also found in these
 lokoktiyon evam paramparaon ke anusaar unhone ek saraswati mandir kaa nirmaan bhi karavaaya tha
 a Jain writer Merutung has written in his work Prabandha Chintamani that Raja Bhoj had built 104 temples in his capital Dhar alone
 haalanki aaj kii tithi main keval bhojpur mandir hi akelaa bachaa smarak he, jise raja bhoj ke naam ke saath joda ja saktaa he
 According to Prabandha Chintamani; When King Bhoj once visited Srimal, he told the poet Magha about the temple named Bhojaswamin which he was about to build
 iske uparant raja malwa ko laut gayi
 Though the Magh poet was not a contemporary of Raja Bhoj, the story seems to be anachronistic
 yah mandir multah ek 18
5 mile lambe evam 7
5 mile chaude sarovar ke tat par bana tha
 In the construction plan of this lake, King Bhoj built three dams of stone and sand
 inamen se pehla baandh betwa nadi par bana tha jo jal ko roke rakhata tha evam shesh teen ore se us ghati main pahadiyaan thim
 The second dam kept the drainage of water by connecting the location between the two hills near present-day Mandua village and the third dam was built in place of today's Bhopal city which diverts the water of a small seasonal river Kaliyasot to this Betwa lake
 Used to give ye kritrim jalashay 15veen shatabdi tak bane rahe the
 According to a Gond legend, Malwa Naresh Hoshang Shah broke this dam with his army, which took him three months
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki yahan hoshangshah kaa ladkaa band ke sarovar main main dub gaya tha tathaa bahut dhundne par bhi uski laash tak nahin mili
 Enraged, he blew the dam with a cannon and tried to knock the temple down with a cannon too
 iske kaaran mandir kaa upar or bagal kaa hissaa gir gaya
 Due to the breakdown of this dam, all the water was washed away and then due to the abrupt termination of this immense water, the climate change was brought in the Malwa region

 The stone used in temple construction was obtained from the stony areas of Bhojpur itself
 mandir ke nikat se dur tak pattharon va chattaanon kii kataai ke avshesh dikhaai dete hai
 The author Vidya Dehejia's book Early Stone Temples of Odisha mentions that there is a similarity in the construction of the Shiva temple in Bhojpur and the Lingaraja temple in Bhubaneswar and some more temples
 bhojpur mandir main bahut se anokhe ghatak dekhne ko milte hai jinamein se kuch is prakaar se hai: garbhagrih prabhag se mandap kaa vilopan, mandir main gumbadakaar shikhar ke bajaay sidhi rekhiy chat aadi
 Three of the outer walls of the temple are completely flat from the exterior, but they are said to be of the 12th century
 in anokhe ghatakon ke adhyayan karne ke uparaant ek shodhakartta krishna dev kaa mat he ki sambhawatah ye mandir antyeshti aadi kriyakarm sambandhi kaaryon se sambandhit rahaa hoga; jaisaa praayah shmashaan ghat aadi ke nikatavartti aaj bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 This research is also confirmed by some medieval architectural text discovered by Madhusudan Dhaki in due course
 in khandit paathyanshon se gyaat hua ki kai ucchkulin vyaktiyon kii mrityu uparaant unke avasheshon yaa antyeshti sthalon par ek smarak rupi mandir banavaa diya jaataa tha
 These types of temples were called swargaharana-prasada
 paath ke anusaar is prakaar ke mandiron main ekal shikhar ke sthaan par paraspar peeche kii ore ghatati hui pathar kii silliyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 According to Kirit Mankodi, the superstructure of the Bhojpur temple suits this format
 unke anumaan ke anusaar raja bhoj ne is mandir ko sambhawatah apane swargavaasi pita sindhuraj yaa taaoo vaakpati munj hetu banwaaya hoga, jinaki mrityu shatru kshetra main apmanjanak rup main hui thi
 Looking here, it appears that the construction work must have been stopped immediately
 haalanki iske kaaran abhi tak agyaat hi hai kintu itihaas vettaon kaa anumaan he ki aisa kisi prakritik aapadaa, sansadhano kii aapurti main kami athwa kisi yuddh ke armbh ho jane ke kaaran hi hua hoga
 The building did not even have a roof before its revival work began in 2006-07
 isse hi itihasvid kekemuhammad ne anumaan lagaaya ki chat sambhawatah nirmaan kaal main puure bhaar ke sahi akalan main ganitiya vaastu dosha ke kaaran nirmaan-kaal main hi dhah gayi hogi
 Then King Bhoj would have stopped the construction of the temple by not rebuilding it due to this defect
 tab kii parityakt sthal se mili saakshyon se aaj ke samay main itihasvidon, puratatvavidon evam vaastuvidon ko 11veen shatabdi kii mandir nirmaan style ke aayojan evam yantriki kaa bhi kaafii gyaan miltaa he
 Several quarry sites have also been found on the northern and eastern side of the temple, where incomplete crafts and crafts of various levels have also been found
 iske alaava mandir ke upree bhaag ke nirmaan hetu pathar ke baari shilp bhaagon ko khadaan se upar tak le jane ke liye bani bahut badi dhalaan bhi mili he
 Many sculptures have been found in such a way, brought from the mine near the temple
 inhen mandir nirmaan ke samay baad main prayog karnaa hoga, kintu nirmaan kaary ruk jane se inhen aise hi chhod diya gaya hoga
 The Archaeological Survey Department transferred them to its treasury house in the 20th century
 mandir nirmaan kii sthapaty yojana kaa vivaran khadaan bhaag ke nearesth pattharon par ukera gaya he
 It is known from this plan that there was a plan to build a large temple complex in which many other temples were also to be built
 is yojana ke safaltapurvak sampann ho jane par ye mandir parisar bharat ke sabase bade mandir parisaron main se ek hota
 The temple building, near the mines and other two temples of the village have been identified with more than 1300 artisans
 inamen mandir ke mukhya dhaanche par vibhinn bhaagon main mili 50 shilpakaaron ke naam bhi sammilit hai
 these na mons, there are other identification marks, such as chakras, severed chakras, wheels, tridents, swastikas, conch shells and Nagari script marks, etc
 ye chihn shilpakaaron yaa unke parivaar ke logon ke kaary raashi ke anumaan yaa akalan hetu banaaye jate the, jinhen imaarat ko antim rup dete samay mitaa diye jate the, kintu mandir nirmaan purna na ho paane ke kaaran aise hi rah gayi
 An incomplete statue at the site khadaanon main se ek par mila ek sthapaty khand Sculptures found near the entrance varsh 1950 tak is imaarat kii sanrachana kaafii kamjor ho chali thi
 This was due to continuous rainwater leakage, the resulting damping and the removal of internal protective coating
 1951 main yah sthal pracheen smarak sangrakshan adhinium 1904 ke antargat bhartiya puratetvik surveykshan vibhaag ko sangrakshan evam punaruddhar hetu saunp diya gaya
 In the early 1990s, the survey department carried out the repair work of the platform and the steps of the sanctum sanctorum and restored the removed stones
 unhone mandir ke uttar-pashchimi ore kii diwaar kii bhi punaruddhar abhiyaan ke antargat marammat kii
 After this, the work stopped for some time
 varsh 2006-07 ke dauraan kekemuhammad ke adhinsth vibhaag ke ek dal ne smarak ke punaruddhar kaary ko punah armbh kiya
 He also restored a ruptured pillar of the structure
 ye 12 ton bhaar kaa ekashm stambh vishesh shilpakaaron evam kaarigaron dwaara mul prati se ekadam miltaa hua banaaya janaa tha, atah iske liye mul sanrachana se mail khate pashaan kii desh paryant khoj ke uparaant shila ko agra ke nikat se laayaa gaya va is stambh kaa nirmaan sampann hua
 After this was made, the team could not get such a long arm crane machine, due to which the team completed the work with the help of a series of winches and levers
 is shrunkhlaa ko banane main unhen chah maah kaa samay laga
 KK Muhammed found that the weight of the two pillars of the temple was 33 tons, and both of them were monolithic, so it would have been a challenging task for the erstwhile artisans in the absence of modern technology and resources
 isi team ne mandir kii chat ke khule bhaag ko bhi ek naye mul sanrachana se mail khate hue vaastu ghatak se badla
 Because these components are made of fiber-glass, one is far less in weight than that part of the original structure, so does not put unnecessary load on the structure, the other is also able to effectively prevent rainwater leakage
 iske baad anya sroton se chat par jal risaav unmoolan hetu vibhaag ne deevaaron evam is nayi chat ke ghatak ke bich ke sthaan ko pathar kii silliyon ko tirachha rakhkar dhank diya he

 Although the upper superstructure of the temple is incomplete, it is clear that the roof with its peaked sloping surface was not to be built

 According to Adam Hardy, the shape of the summit would have to be the shape of the phalanx, although by other indications it appears to be of bhumij shape
 is mandir kii chat gumbadakaar hai jabaki itihaaskaaron ke anusaar mandir kaa nirmaan bharat main islam ke aagaman ke pehle hua tha
 Therefore, the unfinished domed roof on the sanctum sanctorum of the temple proves the practice of dome construction in India as pre-islam
 haalanki islamic gumbadon se yahaan ke gumbad kii nirmaan kii takanic bhinn thi
 Hence, some scholars consider it as the first domed roof building in India

 In this way Kasturba was 6 months older than Gandhiji in Gandhi's age
 kasturba gandhi ke pita 'gokuldaas makanji' saadhaaran sthiti ke vyapaaree the
 Kasturba was the third child of Gokuldas Makanji
 us jamaane main koi ladakiyon ko padhaata to tha nahin, vivaah bhi alpavay main hi kar diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, Kasturba was also illiterate as a child and at the age of seven she was engaged to 6-year-old Mohandas
 teraa saal kii aayu main un donon kaa vivaah ho gaya
 Bapu tried to keep a check on them from the beginning and wanted Kasturba not to go anywhere without permission from them, but the more she pressed them the more she would get freedom and go wherever she wanted
 pati-patni 1888 i
 tak lagbhag saath-saath hi rahe kintu baapu ke england pravaas ke baad se lagbhag agle baarah varsh tak donon praaia: alag-alag se rahe
 Bapu had to leave for Africa shortly after returning from England
 jab 1896 main ve bharat aae tab ba ko apane saath le gaye
 Since then, she has been following the footsteps of Bapu
 unhone unki tarah hi apane jivan ko sada bana liya tha
 She was always with him in Bapu's religious and civil services
 yahi unke saare jivan kaa saar he
 In many of Bapu's fasts, Baa was often with him and kept his essence
 jab 1932 main harijanon ke prashn ko lekar baapu ne yarvada jail main aamaran upwas aarambh kiya us samay ba sabarmati jail main thim
 At that time she became very restless and got rested only when she was sent to Yerwada Jail
 dharm ke sanskaar ba main gahare paithe hue the
 She was not ready to corrupt the Manus body by consuming meat and alcohol at any stage
 africa main kathin beemaari kii avasthaa main bhi unhone maance kaa shorwa pinaa asweekaar kar diya or aaajeevan is baat par drudh raheen
 In South Africa, in 1913, a law was passed that recognized marriages other than those conducted in accordance with Christianity and recorded with the marriage department official
 duusare shabdon main hindu, musalmaan, parsi aadi logon ke vivaah avaidh qaraar die gaye or aisi vivaahit striyon kii sthiti patni kii na hokar rakhel sareekhee ban gai
 Bapu tried hard to get this law canceled
 par jab ve safal na hue tab unhone satyagrah karne kaa nishchay kiya or usamen sammilit hone ke liye striyon kaa bhi aahvaan kiya
 But he discussed this matter with other women but did not discuss it with Ba
 ve nahin chaahate the ki ba unke kehane se satyagraiyon main jaayan or phir baad main kathinaaiyon main padakar visham paristhiti upasthit karen
 They wanted them to go free and go if they persevered
 jab ba ne dekha ki baapu ne unase satyagrah main bhaag lene kii koi charchaa nahin kii to badi du:khee hui or baapu ko upalambh diya
 Swetchaya then joined the Satyagraha and jailed along with three other women
 jail main jo bhojan mila vah akhaadya tha at: unhone falahar karne kaa nishchay kiya
 But when his request was not heeded, he started fasting
 nidaan paanchaven din adhikariyon ko jhukna padaa
 But the fruits given were not enough for the whole meal
 at: ba ko teen maheene jail main aadhe pet bhojan par rahanaa padaa
 When she got out of jail, her body was left stagnant
 dakshin africa main jail jane ke sivaa kadachit vahaan ke kisi saarvajanik kaam main bhaag nahin liya kintu bharat aane ke baad baapu ne jitne bhi kaam uthaae, un sabamein unhone ek anbhavi sainik kii bhanti haath bantaya
 During the Satyagraha of Champaran, Ba also lived in Tiharwa village and roamed in the villages and distributed medicines
 unke is kaam main nilhe goron ko raajnneeti kii bu ai
 He set up their hut in Ba's absence
 ba kii us jhopadi main bachche padhate the
 He did not like to close this chatsala even for a day, so he woke up all night and set up another hut of grass
 isi prakaar kheda satyagrah ke samay ba striyon main gum ghumkar unhen utsahit karti rahi
 The statement he gave when Bapu was arrested in 1922 and was sentenced to six years, distinguished him as a heroine
 unhone gandhi ji ke giraftaar ke virodh main videshi kapadon ke tyaag ke liye logon kaa aahvaan kiya
 Like youths, they roamed the villages of Gujarat to tell Bapu's message
 1930 main dandi kooch or dharasana ke dhaave ke dinon main baapu ke jail jane par ba ek prakaar se baapu ke abhaav kii purti karti raheen
 She was patient, assisting the people suffering from the atrocities of the police
 1932 or 1933 kaa adhikansh samay unka jail main hi beetaa
 In 1939, Thakur Saheb of Rajkot agreed to give certain rights to the subjects, but later retracted
 janata ne iske viruddh apana virodh prakat karne ke liye satyagrah karne kaa nishchay kiya
 When Ba heard this, he felt that Rajkot was his own house
 vahaan hone vaale satyagrah main bhaag lenaa unka kartavya he
 He obtained Bapu's permission for this and as soon as he reached Rajkot, he was put under house arrest in a case of civil disobedience
 pehle unhen ek ekant sunsaan main based gaanv main rakhaa gaya jahaan kaa vaataavaran unke tanik bhi anukool na tha
 The public agitated that their health is not good, it is inhuman to keep them away from medical facilities
 falat: ve rajkot se 10-15 mile dur ek rajmahal main rakhi gayin
 Shortly after Ba's departure, Bapu also decided to participate in Satyagraha and started fasting there
 jab ba ko isaki khabar mili to unhone ek samay hi bhojan karne kaa nishchay kiya
 She always used to do this during Bapu's fast
 do teen din baad hi rajkot sarkaar ne yah bhulaava dekar ki ve baapu se milanaa chahen to ja sakati hai, unhen baapu ke paas bhej diya
 But when no one came to take them back to the place of detention in the evening, it was found that they had been released from this deception
 baapu ko yah sahya na tha
 He sent Ba back to jail at one o'clock in the night
 rajkot sarkaar kii himmat na hui ki vah sari raat unhen sadak par rahane de
 She was taken back to the palace and thereafter she was released the next day
 9 agast 1942 ko baapu aadi ke giraftaar ho jane par ba ne, shivaji park main, jahaan swayan baapu bhaashan dene vaale the, sabha main bhaashan karne kaa nishchay kiya kintu park ke dwaar par pahunchne par giraftaar kar lee garin
 Two days later, she was sent to the Aga Khan palace in Poona
 baapu giraftaar kar pehle hi vahaan bheje ja chuke the
 She was unwell at that time
 15 agast ko jab ekaek mahadev desai ne mahaprayan kiya to ve baar baar yahi kahati raheen mahadev kyon gaya; main kyon nahin? baad main mahadev desai kaa chitasthaan unke liye shankar-mahadev kaa mandir sa ban gaya
 She would regularly go there, praying for samadhi and greeting him
 ve usapar deep bhi jalawaatin
 His health deteriorated again on the night of his arrest and he did not improve satisfactorily and finally he finished his career on 22 February 1944

 Evidence of this is found in Hindu motifs and temples originating in places such as Chuanzhou in southeast China and Kai-yu-aan-temple in Fujian province
