 In this stage, there are many glands from which gastric juice is formed
 shleshmal kala ke baahar vah praant he jo adhoshleshmal kehalaata he
 It has veins of blood vessels and branches of emulsion

 The third part then turns in front of the aorta and the aorta, inwards or towards the vertebrae, and the fourth part moves up to the second lumbar vertebrae, where it combines with the asteroid to form the duodenal asteroid
 grahani ko chhodkar kshudantra ke pratham bhaag kaa naam agrachhudantra he
 The remaining part is called asteroid
 donon kii rachana main na to koi bhed hota he or na donon ke bich koi vishesh seemaa rahati he
 Only the first part, which grows in the upper and left parts of the abdomen, has been given the name of the foreskin
 or udar ke nichle daahine bhaag main sthit kshudantra kehalaata he, jo trikantri kapatika dwaara brihadantra kii andhanal naamak pratham bhaag main khulata he
 The microscopic composition of the intestine is similar to that of the stomach
 sabase bheetar shleshmal str he, jisaki maatra atyadhik hone se gahari sikudne ban jaati hai or unpar ankur sadrush ubhaar bhi bane hote hai
 These are the euphemisms whose main function is absorption of the digested food juices
 iske baahar adhoshleshmal praant ke pashchaat vrittakar or usase baahar anudairdhya maansasutron ke str hai
 On the outside, a layer of paritonium remains, whose intestines look smooth and glowing pink
 kshudantra kii 20, 22 foot lambii nalee kundaliyon ke rup main, jaise sarp kundali banaakar baithta he, udar main rahati he

 He is also known for fighting and winning at the age of 80
 vir kunwar singh kaa janm 23 april 1777 ko bihar ke bhojpur jile ke jagadishpur gaanv main hua tha
 His father Babu Sahabzada Singh was among the descendants of the famous ruler Bhoj

 In 1857, Hindus and Muslims stepped in to drive the British out of India
 mangal pandey kii bahaduree ne saare desh main viplav machaa diya
 The soldiers of the Danapur Regiment of Bihar, Barrackpore and Ramgarh in Bengal revolted
 meerut, kanpur, lakhanu, elahabaad, jhaansi or dilli main bhi aag bhadak uthi
 In such a situation Babu Kunwar Singh led the Indian troops
 27 april 1857 ko danapur ke sipaahiyon, bhojpuri javaanon or anya saathiyon ke saath aara nagar par babu vir kunwar singh ne kabja kar liya
 Even after millions of efforts of the British, Bhojpur remained independent for a long time
 jab angreji fouj ne aara par hamalaa karne kii koshish kii to bibiganj or bihiya ke jangalon main ghamaasan ladaai hui
 The brave freedom fighters marched towards Jagdishpur

 The British historian Holmes has written about him, 'that old Rajput fought against the British power with amazing valor and pride
 yah ganimat thi ki yuddh ke samay kunwar singh kii umr assi ke kareeb thi
 If he were young, the British would probably have left India in 1857
 ' He fought the last battle on 23 April 1858, near Jagdishpur
 east india company ke bhaade ke sainikon ko inhone puri tarah khaded diya
 Despite being badly injured that day, this Ranbankure killed the flea fleets from Jagdishpur Fort by taking off the flag named "union Jack"

 The Apachi or Apache is a Native American tribal tribe from North America
 yah sanyukt rajya america ke dakshin-pashchimi bhaag main rahete hai or kuch aathabaskai bhashaayen bolte hai
 Their habitat was in eastern Arizona, northwest Mexico, New Mexico, Texas, and some parts around it
 aitihaasik nazariye se inke qabeele bahut shaktishaalee the or lambe arase tak inhone mexico or america main basane vaale europian mul ke logon ke saath dat ke muqaabala kiya
 Apache squads raided the Spanish Thikano in Mexico in the late 17th century, and in the 19th century, the US military found them to be shrewd and feared rivals
 apaachiyon ke paas ek navaho naam kii jati bhi rahati he jo samskruti or bhashaa main apaachiyon se milti-julati he, lekin inhen do bhinn samudaay mana jaataa he
 The Apache people speak the Athabaskai languages, which are also spoken in Alaska and Canada apart from this region
 mana jaataa he kii lagbhag 1000 isvi main apaachiyon ke purvaj apane dakshin-pashchimi vaas kshetra main daakhil hue
 He used to go from place to place, living the life of Banjaras
 is vajah se unhone bahut kam nivas-sthanon kaa nirmaan kiya jis se unke itihaas ke bare main khojbin karnaa bhi kathin ho gaya he
 In April 1541, Spanish explorer Francisco Coronado arrived in their area and he said about them: dhire-dhire yahan par bahut se spani or mexiki log bas gaye
 Apachi and these people used to attack each other and also do business among themselves
 sanyukt rajya america ne 1846 main mexico ke saath yuddh ladaa or vah apaachiyon ke bahut se kshetra kaa maalik bana gaya
 At first there was mostly peace between the Apaches and the Americans, but after some time gold came out in the Santa Rita Mountains of the Apache region
 is se bahut se america is kshetra main aaye or america sena or apaachiyon main bahut si jhadpen hui
 The US government made a policy of encircling the evacuees on a limited American Indian reserve
 americanyon ke saath ladane waalon main jeronimo naam kaa ek sardaar bahut prasiddh he
 In the end, the US Army defeated the Apaches
 bahut maare gaye or aape samskruti ko maarane ke liye bahut se apachi bacchon ko maan-baap se alag karne america paathshaalaon main rakhaa gaya, jahaan unhen apni bhashaa bolne yaa apane dharm kaa paalan karne par sazaa di jaati thi
 Many Apache children grew up without learning their mother tongue
 aadhunik kaal main bahut se apachi apni puraani samskruti kii raksha karne or apachi bhashaaon ko jivit rakhane ke prayaas main jute hue hai
 Three characters are often described in Apache theology
 pehla jeevandaata he jisane brahmand kii sristi kari lekin uske baad uskaa maanav jivan main koi vishesh haath nahin tha
 The other two are Jalaputra and Shatradaman, who fight monsters and creatures harmful to humans
 uttar america ke is bhaag main ek lomadee se miltaa-julata kyoti naam kaa jaanavar bhi miltaa he jise apachi kahaniyon main ek chaalaak paatr kii tarah darshaya gaya he
 Some people in Apachi society had knowledge of religion and medicine
 yah vaidya-pujari yah bhi jaanate the ke koun si sthaneey aushadhiyon se kin marzon kaa upachaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Often there was a Rajju Laktaka around its neck which is called Ize-kloth and which has been compared to Hindu Janeu
 darshan main, saar ek gun yaa gunon kaa samucchy hota hai jo kisi satva yaa padaarth ko moulikta detaa hai, or jo anivaaryta se uske paas hota hi hai, or jiske abhaav main vah apni pahchaan kho detaa hai
 Essence, in tatvamimamsa, is often considered synonymous with the soul, and some existentialists argue that individuals acquire spirits and spirits once they come into existence, that they develop their spirits and spirits in their lifetime
 Kierkegaard ke liye, haalanki, saar kaa kendra "prakruti" par tha
 For him, there is nothing like "human nature" that will determine how a human will behave or what a human will be
 pratham, vah astitv main aata hai, or phir gun aate hai
 The more materialistic and skeptical existentialism of jean-paul Sartre further exacerbated this existentialist idea, by explicitly rejecting any metaphysical essence, such as the soul, but arguing that there is only existence, with virtues as essence
 atah, astitvvaadi pravachan main, saar kaa sandarbh, bhautik pahalu se ho saktaa he, yaa kisi vyakti ke jari jeev ke gun se ho saktaa he, yaa yah astitvvaadi pravachan ke prakaar par nirbhar karata hai ki uskaa sandarbh maanav ke andaruni anant se ho saktaa he 
 Within the medium view of Mahayana Buddhism, Chandrakirti represents himself in the following way: nagarjun kii moolmadhyamakakarika par tipanni karte huen, buddhapalita jodate hai ki, In Nagarjuna's Madhyamakarikarika, the 15th chapter examines the essence
 kisi vyakti ke vyaktitv ko samajhane main, uske swadharm or swabhaav ke bich antar kiya jaataa hai
 Nature is the nature of a person, which is the result of his values
 ye sanskaar aadaton or maansik modelon ko nirmaan karte hai or ve apni prakruti ban jate hai
 However there is another type of nature which is a pure inner quality - remembrance - we focus here only on the nature created by the sacraments
 dharm dhri dhaatu se aata he
 It is he who holds sattva
 arthath, dharm vah he jo satva ko akhandta pradaan karata he or us satta ke mul gun or pahchaan, rup or kaary dhaaran karata he
 Religion is also defined as morality and duty
 dharm karnaa karnaa, arthath nek rahanaa; dharm karnaa, arthath kartavya paalan karnaa

 Once, due to the fear of austerity, Shri Krishna started living in the middle of the sea
 isi nagari kaa naam aajkal dwarikapuri he
 Satrajit Yadav, residing in Dwarikapuri, worshiped Suryanarayana
 tab bhagwaan surya ne use nity aath bhaar sona dene vaali syamantak naamak mani apane gale se utarkar de di
 When Satirajit Yadav entered the society after getting the gem, Shri Krishna expressed his desire to get that gem
 satrajit ne vah mani shrikrishna ko na dekar apane bhai prasenjit ko de di
 One day, he went on a hunting horse and went for hunting
 vahaan ek sher ne use maar daalaa or mani le lee
 The king of bears, Jamwant, killed the lion and went to the cave with a gem
 jab prasenjit kai dinon tak shikaar se na lautaa to satrajit ko bada dukh hua
 He thought, Sri Krishna must have killed him to get the gem
 atah bina kisi prakaar kii jaankaree jutaaye usne prachaar kar diya ki shrikrishna ne prasenjit ko markar syamantak mani chin lee he
 Srikrishna along with many people went to the forest to find Prasenjit to stop this public blasphemy
 vahaan par prasenjit ko sher dwaara maar daalana or sher ko rich dwaara maarane ke chihn unhen mil gaye
 While searching for bear's feet, they reached the cave of Jamawant and went inside the cave
 vahaan unhone dekha ki jamvant kii putree us mani se khel rahi he
 Jamwant was ready for war upon seeing Krishna
 yuddh chhid gaya
 Outside the cave, Sri Krishna's companions waited for him for seven days
 phir ve log unhen mar gaya jaanakar pashchaatap karte hue dwarikapuri laut gaye
 Here, even after fighting continuously for twenty-one days, Jamwant could not defeat Shri Krishna
 tab usne sochaa, kahin yah vah avatar to nahin jiske liye mujhe ramchandraji kaa vardaan mila tha
 On getting this confirmation, he married his daughter to Sri Krishna and gave Mani in dowry
 shrikrishna jab mani lekar waapas aae to satrajit apane kiye par bahut lajjit hua
 To get rid of this shame, he also married his daughter to Shri Krishna
 1018 gregory calendar kaa ek saadhaaran varsh he
 The flute is a musical instrument of the wooden instrument family
 narkat vaale kashtha vaadya upkarnon ke vipareet, bansuri ek arophone yaa bina narkat vaala vaayu upkaran he jo ek chhidr ke paar hawa ke pravaah se dhwani utpann karata he
 According to hornbostal-sache's instrument classification, the flute is classified as an acute-stroke aerophone
 bansurivadak ko ek flut player, ek floutist, ek flutist, yaa kabhi kabhi ek fluter ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 The flute is one of the earliest known musical instruments
 kareeb 40,000 se 35,000 saal pehle kii tithi kii kai bansuriyaan germany ke swabian alb kshetra main pai gai hai
 These flutes indicate that an evolving musical tradition existed in Europe from the earliest times of modern human presence
 khoji gai sabase puraani bansuri gupha main rahane vaale ek tarun bhaaluu kii jaangh kii haddi kaa ek tukdaa ho sakati he, jisamen do se chaar chhed ho sakate hai, yah slovenia ke divje beb main pai gai he or kareeb 43,000 saal puraani he
 However, the authenticity of this fact often remains disputed
 2008 main germany ke ulm ke paas hohal fells guha main ek or kam se kam 35,000 saal puraani bansuri pai gai
 This five-hole flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from the bone of a vulture's wing
 khoj main shaamil shodhakartaaon ne apane nishkarshon ko agast 2009 main ''nechar'' naamak jarnal main aadhikarik taur par prakashit kiya
 This discovery is also the oldest valid discovery of any instrument in history
 bansuri, paae gaye kai yantron main se ek he, yah hohal fells ke shukr ke saamne or pracheenatam gyaat maanav nakkashi se thodi si duuri par hohal fells kii gupha main pai gai thi
 Upon the discovery's announcement, scientists suggested that "when modern humans suborned Europe, the discovery reflects the presence of a well-established musical tradition of that time"
 Scientists have also suggested that the discovery of the flute may also help explain the "possibly behavioral and creative gulf" between Neanderthals and early modern humans
 memuth ke daant se nirmit, 18
7 semi lambi, teen chhidron vaali bansuri 2004 main khoji gayi thi or do anya hans haddiyon se nirmit bansuriyaan jo ek dashak pehle khudaai main praapt hui thi pracheenatam gyaat vaadyayantron main se hai
 The nine-thousand-year-old goodie, with five to eight holes, constructed from the bones of a red crested crane's wing, was excavated from a mausoleum of Jihu in Henan Man, a province in central China
 pracheenatam prachlit aadi bansuri china ke hubei praant ke suizhau sthal par jeng ke markis yi kii kabr main pai gai ek chi bansuri he
 This was in 433 BC
 The answer belongs to the Zhao dynasty
 yah rogan kiye hue bans se bani hui band chhoron vaali hoti he tathaa iske paanch chhidr sheersh kii ore na hokar duusare chor par hote hai
 According to the tradition, the Chi flute is described in Xi Jing, compiled and edited by Confucius
 bible kii jenesis 4:21 main jubal ko, "un sabhi kaa pita jo ugab or kinnaur bajaate hai", bataaya gaya he
 The former Hebrew word refers to some wind instruments or wind instruments in general, the latter refers to a stringed instrument or commonly to a stringed instrument
 atev, judio isai parampara main jubal ko bansuri kaa avishkaarak mana jaataa he
 Some of the earlier flutes were made of tibias
 bhartiya samskruti evam puraanon main bhi bansuri hameshaa se aavashyak ang rahaa he, evam kuch vrutaton dwaara cross bansuri kaa udbhav bharat main hi mana jaataa he kyonki 1500 i
pus
 ke bhartiya sahitya main cross bansuri kaa vistaar se vivaran he
 When an air current is passed through the orifice of the device, the flute produces a sound due to the air vibrating on the orifice
 chhidr ke paar vaayu ek barnaali yaa syphon srujit karti he jiskaa prabhaav won karman vortax street tak hota he
 It stimulates air in the cylindrical resonant cavity commonly present in the flute
 vadak yantra ke chhidron ko khol evam band kar ke dhwani ke swar main parivartan karata he, is prakaar yah anunaadi kii prabhavi lambaai evam iske sadrush anunaad aavriti main parivartan hota he
 By changing the air pressure and without opening and closing any holes, the player can also change the voice by translating the flute to a multiplied tone in addition to the base frequency
 adhik dhwani ke liye bansuri ko apekshaakrit bade anunadak, badi vaayu dhara yaa bade vaayu dhara veg kaa prayog karnaa hoga
 saamanytah bansuri kii aawaaj iske anunadak or dhwani chhidron ko badha karke badhaayi ja sakati he
 So the police whistle, which is a form of a flute, is very wide in tone and therefore the pipe argon can be louder than a concert flute: a large organ pipe can hold a few cubic feet of air and Its sound holes may be somewhat wide, while the air current of a concert flute is only slightly larger than an inch
 vaayu dhara ko ek uchit kone evam veg se pravaahit karnaa chaiye anyathaa bansuri main vaayu main kampan nahin hoga
 philip yaa nalika vaali bansuriyon main, sankshipt rup se gathit evam sthapit vaayu maarg sikudega evam khuli khidki ke paar labium ramp kinare tak vaayu pravaahit hogi
 pipe organ main, yah vaayu ek niyantrit dhaukani dwaara pravaahit hoti he
 In a non-fipple flute, the air stream definitely flows through the lips of the player called an embosser
 isse vadak ko visheshkar fipil / nalika bansuriyon kii tulana main swar, dhwani va aawaaj kii abhivyakti kii vistrut shrankhla kii suvidha praapt hoti he
 However, this gives the novice player sufficient difficulty to produce the full sound by the end-sounding or transverse flutes compared to the recorder-like nozzles flutes
 anuprastha evam antim sire se bajane vaale bansuri ko bajaane ke liye adhik vaayu kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jisamen gahare shwasan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he evam yah chakree shwasan ko paryaapt jatil banaata he
 Generally the quality or "sound color", called a vowel, changes because flutes can produce notes in many parts and intensities
 dhwani-rang main chhidr kii aantarik akruti jaise ki shankvakar nok main parivartan ke dwaara parivartan yaa sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Sur is a frequency that is a lower register integer multiplier or a "basic" note of a flute
 saamanytah ucch sur ucch anshon kii utpatti main vaayu dhara patali, teevr evam chhidr ke paar kam gahare pravaahit kii jaati he
 The top joint geometry towards phonology performance and tone seems particularly complex, but there is no consensus among producers about a particular shape
 imboshar chhidr kii dhwani vigyaan baadha sabase jatil maandand prathit hoti he
 Complicating factors affecting the acoustics barrier include: the length of the chimney, the diameter of the chimney and the rotation of the end of the rod or chimney and any design restriction in the "throat" of the instrument as in the Japanese Nohkan flute
 ek adhyayan main, jisamen vyavsaayik vaadakon kii aankh main pattee baandhi gai, yah paaya gaya ki ve vibhinn dhaatuon se bane vaadya yantron main koi antar nahin khoj paye
 aankh band karke sunne par pehali baar main koi bhi vaadya yantra kii sahi pahchaan nahin kar paaya evam duusari baar main keval chaandi yantra hi pahachaanaa ja sakaa
 adhyayan kaa yah nishkarsh he ki "diwaar kii saamagree kaa yantra dwaara utpann dhwani swar yaa gatij vistaar par koi gaur karne yogya prabhaav hone kaa pramaan nahin mila"
 durbhagyavash, yah adhyayan shirshajod dizin par niyantran nahin karata jo ki saamanytah swar ko prabhavit karne vaala mana jaataa he 
 niyantrit swar pareekshan yah darshaate he ki nalee kaa dravyaman parivartan utpann karata he evam atah nalee ghanatv evam diwaar kii motaai parivartan paidaa karegi
 hamen dhwani kii pahchaan hetu electronic samvedakon kii tulana main maanav kaanon kii simaaon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chaiye
 In its base form the flute can be an open tube which is played like a bottle
 bansuri kii kuch vistrut shreniyan hai
 The musician or instrumentalist plays most of the flutes from the edges of the lips
 haalanki, kuch bansuriyon, jaise vissal, jamshorn, flageolett, ricorder, tin vissal, tonet, fujara evam okarina main ek nalee hoti he jo vaayu ko kinare tak bhejti he 
 inhen fipil flut kaha jaataa he
 Fipil gives the instrument a distinctive sound that is distinct from non-fipil flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but it is somewhat less controlled by the composer or player
 bagal se bajaayi jane vaali bansuriyon jaise ki pashchimi sangeet kaval, donso, shakuhachi, anasazi flut evam queena ke madhya ek or vibhaajan he
 Flutes played from the side have holes next to the nozzles to produce sound instead of being played from the end of the tube
 antim sire se bajaaye jane vaali bansuriyon ko fipil bansuri nahin samaj lenaa chaiye jaise ki recorder, jo urdhvavat bajaaye jate hai lekin inamen ek aantarik nalee hoti he joki dhwani chhed ke sire tak vaayu bhejti he
 Flutes can be open at one or both ends
 okarina, june, pan pips, police siti evam bosun kii siti ek sire par band hoti he
 Open flute at the end such as concert-flute and recorder are more melodious and hence play more flexible and more playful for the player
 ek organ pipe vaanchit dhwani ke aadhaar par khulaa yaa band ho saktaa he
 Flutes can be played from some different air sources
 paramparaagat bansuri munh se bajaayi jaati hai, yadhyapi kuch samskritiyon main naak se bajaayi jane vaali bansuri prayog hoti he
 Organ flu pipes, which are acoustically similar to tube flutes, are played with a blower or fan
 western concert bansuri, 19veen sadi ke german bansuri kaa vanshaj he
 It is a transverse or transverse flute that closes at the top
