 saamanyat: manushya kii bolne yaa likhane padhane kii chhandrahit saadhaaran vyavhaar kii bhashaa ko gadhy kaha jaataa he
 There is only partial truth in it because it ignores the creative perception of the prose
 saadhaaran vyavhaar kii bhashaa bhi gadhy tabhi kahi ja sakati he jab yah vyavasthit or spasht ho
 Keeping the creative process in mind, it would be more expedient to call prose a simple but systematic language of man or its specific expression
 manushya kii sahaj evam swaabhaavik abhivyakti kaa rup gadhy he
 Many things are the same in poetry and prose
 donon ke upkaran shabd hai jo arth parivartan ke bina ek hi bhandar se liye jate he; donon ke vyakaran or vakyarachana ke niyam ek hi hai, donon hi lay or chitramay ukti kaa sahaara lete hai
 According to Wordsworth there is no fundamental difference between the language of prose and verse
 lekin in sari samaantaaon ke baavjood kavita or gadhy abhivyakti ke do bhinn rup hai
 The disparity of their attitudes towards similar devices often emerges at the level
 lekin unamem keval stareey nahin balki tathvik yaa gunatmak bhed he, jiskaa kaaran yah hai ki kavita or gadhy jagat or jivan ke vishay main manushya kii maansik prakriya ke do bhinn roopon kii abhivyakti hai
 There is evidence of this in the history of his rise and development
 apni pustak ilugen and rielity main codwell ne kavita kii utpatti, saamaajik upadeyata or takanic kaa vistrut vivechan karte hue likhaa he ki sahitya ke sabase praarambhik rup main kavita manushya kii saadhaaran bhashaa kaa unmeshikaran thi
 At that time, poetry was not only emotional but also carried history, religion, philosophy, tantra, mantra, astrology, policy and pharmaceutical knowledge
 use unmesh pradaan karne ke liye sangeet, chand, tuk, maatra yaa swaraghaat, anupras, punrariti, roopak ityadi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Later, the development of civilization, the classification of society, the division of labor and the enlightened literary consciousness also divided the earlier illustrious language — poetry limited itself to the illustrious language of ragas and science, philosophy, history, theology, policy , Fiction and drama adopted the language of ordinary behavior, namely, Kathaya
 aavashyaktaanusaar prayek shakha ne apni vishisht style kii vidhi kaa vikaas kiya, unamem aadan pradaan hua or unase swayan saadhaaran vyavhaar kii bhashaa bhi prabhavit hui
 Man's mental world began to reflect itself in two distinct forms of language - poetry and prose
 kavita or gadhy ke uddeshyon main bhed or bhashaa ke upkaran shabdon ke prati unke drushtikon main bhed kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 The poem originated with the collective labor of man
 shabd anivaaryt: sangeet or praaia: nrity ke sahare puure samooh ke aavegon ko ek bindu par sangathit kar kaary sampann karne kii prerana dete the
 The crop was not in front, the seeds had to be sown
 shabdon kaa kaary tha lahalhati fasal kaa mayavi chitra upasthit kar puure samooh ko beej bone ke liye prerit karnaa
 According to Codwell, words became power through this elusive creation
 kavita samuhik bhaavon or ankakshaon kaa pratibimb thi or unhen udbuddha or sangathit karne kaa asr thi
 Hence the poem's subtle narrative — not the object of its facts — but its proselytizing role in society — the object of its collective sentiments — is the truth of the poem
 saamaajik jivan main shabd vastunishth jagat ke shushk pratik maatr nahin rah jate balki unke saath jivan ke anubhav se utpann saral se jatil hote hue bhavatmak sandarbh jud jate hai
 The poem cannot ignore the pure symbolic meaning of the words, but its main purpose is the semantic organization of the emotional contexts of the words
 kavita shabdon kii nai sristi he
 In the words of Herbert Reid, the words are born again and again during contemplation in the poem
 anek bhashaaon main kavi ke liye prayukt shabd kaa arth srashta he
 The prose replaces the emotional references of words to their objective symbolic meaning
 gadhy main shabdon ke is prakaar ke prayog ko dhyaan main rakhkar herbert read ne gadhy ko nirmaanatmak abhivyakti kaha he, aisi abhivyakti jisamen shabd nirmaataa ke chaaron ore prayog ke liye eent gaare kii tarah bane banaae taiyaar karte hai
 It is clear that it is possible to completely divide the objective meaning of the word and its emotional context
 yahi kaaran he ki kavita sarvatha kathyshunya nahin ho sakati or gadhy sarvatha bhavashunya nahin ho saktaa
 There is a natural exchange in the techniques of poetry and prose
 kintu jahaan unke vishisht dharmon kaa bodh nahin hota, vahaan hamen kavita ke sthaan par foohad gadhy or padya ke sthaan par foohad kavita ke darshan hote hai
 Saying the language of objective truth does not mean that prose is less than poetry, or that its social purpose is less than poetry, or that it is an artful expression of language
 vastav main bahut se aise kaary jo kavita kii shakti ke baahar he, gadhy dwaara sampann hote hai
 It was realized long ago that rational development of ideas is not possible in the rhetorical language of poetry
 kavita se kam viksit avasthaa main bhi gadhy kii vishasht shakti ko pahachaanakar arastu ne apane prasiddh granth retoric main use pratiti parasuation, dusron ko apane vichaaron se prabhavit karne kii bhashaa kaha tha, jiske mukhya tatv hai-vichaaron kaa tarksangat kram, varnan kii sajivta, kalpana, chitrayojna, sahajata, lay, vyaktivaichitrya, ukti-saundarya, oj, sanyam
 At each of these points, the boundaries of poetry and prose seem to meet, but both of them have different ways of using them
 udaahranarth, unke do tatv, lay or chitrayojna, liye ja sakate hai jinaki bahut charchaa hoti he
 The rhythm of prose has more elasticity or diversity than the rhythm of poetry because the rhythm in prose is not a unit of thought, but of syntax
 kavita main praaia:
 The effect is intensified by repetition by making rhythm the unit of syntax
 kavita se kahin zyada gadhy main lay anubhuti kii vaani he
 Often the prose persona is inaugurated through rhythm
 kavita ke praan chitrayojna main basate hai, jabaki gadhy main uskaa prayog atyant sanyam ke saath vichaar ko aalokit karne ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 Regarding the great genre of English prose, Swift, Dr
 Johnson said: This wicked never takes the risk of even a metaphor
 mukhya vastu yah he ki gadhy main bhashaa kii sari kshamtaayen vichaar kii achook abhivyakti ke adheen rahati hai
 The freedom to embellish language in poetry is often the reason for the inadvertent tendency to use words and syntax
 visheshnon kaa jitna durupyog kavita main sambhav he utana gadhy main nahin
 Music in poetry is often a cover for cheap sentimentality
 gadhy main kathy kaa mahatv usapar ankush kaa kaam karata he
 Therefore, the discipline of prose is the best means of realizing the beauty of language
 tii
 es
 iliyat ke shabdon main achche gadhy ke gunon ko hona acchhee kavita kii pehali or kam se kam aavashyaktaa he
 Prose began as the language of history, science, aesthetics etc
 baad main vah upyog se kala kii ore pravrutt hua
 Based on the development of forms, three broad categories have been created - descriptive, which includes fiction, history, biography, travel, etc
 vivechanaatmak, jisamen vigyaan, saundaryashasre, aalochana, darshan, dharm or nitishasre, vidhi, raajnneeti ityadi aate hai, evam bhavatmak, jisamen upar ke anek vishyon ke atirikt atmparak niabandh or naatak aate hai
 According to the subjects it is necessary to manipulate the volume of flow, clarity, pictoriality, rhythm, personal feeling, adornment etc
 in the prose, but walls cannot be erected between the prose lines
 lekhak kii ruchi or prayojan ke anusaar ve ek duusare main ant:pravisht hoti rahati he
 The novel has become a specialized laboratory of prose in the modern era
 kavita rah rahakar kaaphi dinon tak shabdon ke pathya par rahati he, gadhy main nae puraane, sookhe chikne sabhi prakaar ke shabdon ko pachaane kii adbhut shakti hoti he
 According to Bonami Dabri, all good living prose is experimental
 upanyaas gadhy kii is kshamta kaa puraa upyog kar saktaa he
 Such experiments have happened more in America than England and Wyndham Lewis, Hemingway, Stein, Faulkner, Andersen, etc
 have given new blood to English prose through their experiments
 gadhy main teji se kentul badalane kii shakti kaa anumaan hindi gadhy ke tej vikaas se bhi kiya ja saktaa he, haalaanki uskaa itihaas bahut purana nahin
 Middleton Murry, an English critic, further pointing to the development of prose in the future, wrote: The extent of prose is infinite, and perhaps the neglect of poetry has made its possibilities less explored

 udahaaran ke liye yah dekha jaataa he 'embi', 'ambi' yaa 'imbi' jodne se 'karne', 'aane' yaa kisi or prakaar kaa sandarbh aa jaataa he: In Manchu, vocal support is also available, in which the vowels within a word need to match
 kuch had tak yah sabhi altaai bhashaaon main dekha jaataa he
 It has been observed in Manchu that in gender cases more than one vowel of a word is changed: kerala main 14 jile hai: Pammal Samband Mudaliar was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the field of art in 1959

 In the Middle Ages, the Romans lived in three different princely states: Valakia, Moldavia, and Transylvania

 Moldavia, Valakia, and Transylvania, by contrast, came under Ottoman suzerainty, but they fully preserved internal autonomy and, until the 18th century, retained some external independence as well
 During this period, Romanian lands gradually disappeared due to the feudal system; Moldavia, Matei Basarab, some rulers such as Stephen the Great, Vessel Lupu and Dimitri Kantemir in Vlad III the Impeller and Konstantin Brankovenu in Valakia), Gabriel Bethlen in Transylvania; Phanariot era; And the origin of the Russian empires emerged as a political and military influence

 In 1699, Transylvania became the territory of the Austrian Empire of the Habsburgs, which was followed by the Austrian conquest of the Turks in the Great Turkish War
 The Austrians, in their turn, rapidly expanded their empire: in 1718, an important part of Valakia, called Oltenia, was incorporated into the Austrian monarchy and it only returned in 1739

 After the unsuccessful revolution of 1848, the great powers did not support the Romanian people's desire to officially transform into a state, putting a pressure on Romania to move alone against the Turks

 prashn : matla kya hota he ? Answer: The initial sher of Ghazal is called Matala
 In both cases of nausea, the rhyme is same
 Matala means Uday
 According to the rules of Urdu ghazal, it is mandatory to have malta and maqta in ghazal or else ghazal is considered incomplete
 lekin aaj-kal navaguntak gazalkaar maktaa ke paramparaagat niyam ko nahin maanate he yaa aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki wo is niyam kii gaharaai main janaa nahin chaahate va iske bina hi ghazal kehete hai
 Some poets write ghazals even without nausea, but the talk is not made; Because whether or not there is a gazelle, the presence of the nausea is laughable, as if the song is loud
 aap sabhi meri is baat se sahamat honge ki yadi kisi geet main mukhdaa na ho to aap khud hi anumaan laga sakate hai geet kaisaa lagegaa
 The singer also needs to take a note like the mouth of the song to set the tone
 ghazal main do matle hon to duusare matle ko 'husnemtala' kaha jaataa he
 There are Kafia and Radifs in both lines in the lion of the pot
 yahan par ek or baat jicaryog he ki matle ke sher se hi ye nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he yaa ye nirdhaarit hota he ki kis maatrik-kram kaa puri ghazal main paalan kiya jaayegaa yaa ghazal kahi jaayegi | 'hussnmatla': If any other mace comes after the initial malt in a ghazal, it is called hussan-e-mtla
 matla-e-sani :ek se adhik matla aane par baad vaala matla yadi pichley matle kii baat ko pusht athwa or spasht karata ho to vah matla-e-sani kehalaata he

 unki kuch pramukh patrikaayen is prakaar hai: Names of Allah in Islam: According to tradition, there are at least 99 names of Allah in Islam, known as' Asmau Allahi al-husna "the beautiful names of Allah"

 Most of the names in these lists are derived from the Quranic text, with a minority in the oral tradition or Sunnah
 naamon kii suchiyaan alag-alag hoti hai kyonki 99 se adhik visheshtaon ko chunane ke liye alag alag prastaav sambodhnaayen or sandarbh kii zaroorat hoti he, or us prakaar hi chunajata he
 Different mentions give different lists of 99 names
 haddees main, mohammad ne kai naamon se allaah ko bulaayaa he
 The origin of the number 99 is particularly attributed to the weakly assumed hadith, although there are at least quoted hadiths that are considered authentic and support the same point
 sahi muslim haddees ke anusaar, 35: 6475 : The Quran refers to the "most beautiful name" of Allah
 gerhard bowing ne sura 17:110 ko locas clasicus ke rup main sanderbhit kiya he, jisamen quran kii tippanee main 99 naamon kii spasht suchiyaan sanlagn kii gai thim
 Import 22: 22–24 contains a group of more than a dozen celestial epithets included in such lists
 rahasywaadee darshanik ebn arabi ne anumaan lagaaya ki 99 naam "brahmad ke aantarik rahasyon ke bahari sanket" hai
 However most of the 99 traditionally listed 99 names are found nowhere in the Quran
 dusron ko haddees se liya jaataa he
 The list is not even necessary, as more than 99 divine names can be linked to the Quran and Hadith
 musalamaanon ke bich koi saarvbhaumik samjhauta nahin he ki vastav main allaah ke naam ke rup main kya myne rakhata he, or kya nahin
 Additionally, while some names are only in the Quran, and others are only in the Hadith, there are some names that appear in both

 The compilations of all Abu Hurairah are the basic features of the list of names
 al- tirmizi ne apni suchi main tippanee kii: "yah haddees garib he; ise abu hurairah ke adhikaar par vibhinn margon se sunaaya gaya he, lekin ham naamon ke ullekh ke bare main nahin jaanate is ke alaava, kai kathaayen hai

 Apartheid then dominated the political, social and economic life of South Africa for the next half century

 At the same time, Europeans living among the African population of the region began to see themselves as rulers of black Africans
 shaskaon or shasiton ke bich shreshthata or nimnata kaa bhed karne ke liye kaalon ko europiyanon se haath bhar dur rakhane kaa aagrah panapana zaruri tha

 inamen sabase zyaada kukhyat kanoon africa janata ke avaagaman par paabandiyaan lagane vaale the
 With the ruling of the National Party committed to apartheid in 1948, the ANC entered into an alliance with the Indian Congress, the Colored People's Congress and the White Congress of Damocrates
