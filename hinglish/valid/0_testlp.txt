 Do not forget any new work, new industry, even in a half-century, before doing any work, you must get information from a knowledgeable astrologer

 === box offis === 50 karod Raghuvansh is an epic poem composed by Kalidas
 is mahakavy main unniis sargon main raghu ke kul main utpann bees raajaaon kaa ikkis prakaar ke chhandon kaa prayog karte hue varnan kiya gaya he
 In it, special descriptions of Dilip, Raghu, Dasaratha, Rama, Kush and Atithi are given
 ve sabhi samaaj main adarsh sthapit karne main safal hue
 Rama is described in this
 unniis main se chah sarg unase hi sambandhit hai
 Adikavi Valmiki composed his Ramayana by making Rama a hero, which many poets and writers of the world followed in their own language and presented the story of Rama in their own way
 kalidas ne yadhyapi ram kii katha rachi parantu is katha main unhone kisi ek paatr ko nayak ke rup main nahin ubhaara
 He composed the story of the entire dynasty in his work 'raghuvansh', which begins with Dileep and ends at Agnivarna
 agnivarn ke maranoparant uski garbhvatee patni ke rajyabhishek ke uparant is mahakavy kii itishree hoti he
 The oldest available commentary on Raghuvansh is that of the 10th-century Kashmiri poet Vallabhadeva
 kintu sarvaadhik prasiddh tikaa mallinath dwaara rachit 'sanjivani' he
 Kalidasa has divided the story of 'raghuvansh' into 19 cantos, in which the stories of Raja Dileep, Raghu, Aj, Dasaratha, Ram, Luv, Kush, Atithi and the later twenty Raghuvanshi kings have been recited
 is vansh kaa patan uske antim raja agnivarn ke vilasita kii ati ke kaaran hota he or yaheen is kriti kii iti bhi hoti he
 The following list of Raghuvanshi kings mentioned in twenty-one cantos is as follows - is katha ke madhyam se kavi kalidas ne raja ke charitra, adarsh tathaa rajdharm jaise vishyon kaa bada sundar varnan kiya he
 There is also a part of this chapter of Suryavansh in the history of India, in which there is a message that on the one hand, fame and fame of the king who maintains the religion is spread all over the country, on the other hand, due to the characterless king, there is certain loss and descent, Even if he is a descendant of any higher lineage! samalochakon ne kalidas kaa sarvshereshth mahakavy 'raghuvansh' ko mana he
 From the beginning to the end, the singular skill of the accomplished poet is expressed in it
 dilip or sudakshina ke tapomay jivan se prarambh is kavy main kramash: raghuvanshi raajaaon kii vadanyata, veerta, tyaag or tap kii ek ke baad ek kahani udghaatit hoti he or kavy kii samaapti kaamuk agnivarn kii vilasita or unke avsaan se hoti he
 Dilip and Sudakshina's tenacity: the demeanor, the dialogue of Kautas and Raghu, the disciples of Varatantu, the picture of Indumati Swayamvara, Ajavilapa, the voyage of Rama and Sita, the glory of exiled Sita, the confluence, the emptiness of the city of Ayodhya, etc
 And the reader looks at them with an amused look
 anek kathankon kaa ekatrikaran hone par bhi is mahakavy main kavi ne unka ek duusare se ek prakaar samanvay kar diya he jisase unamem swaabhaavik pravaah kaa sanchaar ho gaya he
 In this lit Nakshatramala of many nappies of 'raghuvansh', the poet has given Tejavita and dignity to the glorious Rama of Adikavi Valmiki
 varnanon kii sajivta, aagat prasargon kii swaabhaaviktaa, style kaa maadhurya tathaa bhav or bhashaa kii drushti se 'raghuvansh' sanskritmahakavyon main anupam he
 The style of the Raghuvansha epic is simple and not prashanti, simple and prasadagunmayi
 alankaaron kaa suruchipurna prayog swaabhaavik evam sahaj sundar he
 In the selected words, the poet has taken the wonderful trick of showing the beauty of the favored object in the thirteenth canto of 'raghuvansh', with a beautiful tableau of the subject
 ganga or yamuna ke sangam kii, unke mishrit jal ke pravaah kii chata kaa varnan karte samay ek ke baad ek upamaaon kii shrunkhlaa upasthit karte hue ant main kavi ne shiv ke sharir ke saath-saath uski shobhaa kii upama di he or is prakaar saundarya ko seemaa se nikaalkar anant ke haathon saunp diya- Kalidas is an expressive poet of mainly gentle and delightful expressions
 isiilie prakruti kaa komal, manoram or madhur paksh unki is kriti main bhi ankit hua he
 In the beginning of Raghuvansh poetry, Mahakavi has given many types of delightful sermons for pranamatras on the pretext of describing the importance and merit of the kings of Raghukul
 raghuvansh kavy main kalidas ne raghuvanshi raajaaon ko nimitt banaakar udarcharit purushon kaa swabhaav pathakon ke sammukh rakhaa he
 If you want to know the description of Raghuvanshi kings in a nutshell, then in one verse of Raghuvansh, its result is as follows- ) The story of 'raghuvansh' begins with Dilip and his wife Sudakshina's entry into the ashram of sage Vasistha
 raja dilip dhanwaan, gunwan, budhimaan or balavaan he, saath hi dharmaparayan bhi
 They are rich in every way, but there is a shortage of children
 santan prapti kaa aashirwad paane ke liye dilip ko gomata nandini kii seva karne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 As usual, Nandini is wandering in the forest and Dileep also walks along to guard her
 itane main ek singh nandini ko apana bhojan bananaa chahta he
 Dilip dedicates himself and begs Singh to make him his diet
 singh prarthana sweekaar kar letaa he or unhen maarane ke liye jhapatata he
 With this leap, the lion disappears
 tab nandini bataati he ki usee ne dilip kii pariksha lene ke liye yah mayajaal rachaa tha
 Nandini is pleased with Dilip's service and blesses her son's attainment
 raja dilip or sudakshina nandini kaa doodh grahan karte hai or unhen putr ratna kii prapti hoti he
 This talented son is named Raghu, due to his might, this dynasty is known as Raghuvansh
 raghu ke parakram kaa varnan kalidas ne vistaarpurvak apane granth ‘raghuvansh’ main kiya he
 On stealing the horse of Ashwamedha Yagya, he fought with Indra and had rescued him
 unhone vishwajit yajna sampann karke apana sara dhan daan kar diya tha
 When he had no money, one day Rishiputra Kauts came and asked him for 14 crores gold coins so that he could give his Guru Dakshina
 raghu ne is brahman ko santusht karne ke liye kuber par chadhai karne kaa man banaaya
 On receiving this information, Kuber panicked and filled his treasure by himself
 raghu ne sara khazaana brahman ke hawaale kar diya; parantu us brahmanputra ne keval 14 karod mudraaen hi sweekaari
 Raghu's son Aj was also very powerful
 unhone vidarbha kii rajkumaari indumati ke swayamvar main jaakar unhen apni patni banaaya
 Kalidasa has beautifully described this swayamvara in 'raghuvansh'
 raghu ne aj kaa raaj-kaushal dekhakar apana singhaasana unhen saunp diya or vanprastha le liya
 Like Raghu, Aja also became a skilled king
 ve apni patni indumati se bahut prem karte the
 Once Naradji was pleased and wandering in the sky with his veena
 sanyogvash unki vina kaa ek phool tutaa or bageeche main saiyr kar rahi rani indumati ke sir par gira jisase unki mrityu ho gai
 Raja Aj became upset at Indumati's disconnection and finally took water-tomb
 kalidas ne ‘raghuvansh’ ke aath sargon main dilip, raghu or aj kii jeevani par prakaash daalaa
 Later he described the story of Dasaratha, Rama, Luv and Kush in eight cantos
 jab ram lanka se laut rahe the, tab pushp vimaan main baithi sita ko dandakarany tathaa panchvati ke un sthanon ko dikhaa rahe the jahaan unhone sita kii khoj kii thi
 Kalidas has a very beautiful and poignant illustration of this in the thirteenth canto of 'raghuvansh'
 is sarg se pataa chalata he ki kalidas kii bhugolic jaankaree kitni gahan thi
 Ayodhya's earlier fame and present situation has been described by the poet very skillfully in the sixteenth canto through the dream of Kush
 antim sarg main raghuvansh ke antim raja agnivarn ke bhoga-vilaas kaa chithran kiya gaya he
 The culmination of the king's boast is that when the public comes to see the king, Agnivarna spreads his feet outside the window
 janata ke anadar kaa parinaam rajya kaa patan hota he or is prakaar ek pratapi vansh kii iti bhi ho jaati he

 is granth kii ek visheshta yah bhi he isamen ganpaath diya hua he jo pracheen vrittigranthon main nahin miltaa
 The word 'kashika' can have two meanings
 pratham arth ke anusaar, 'kashika' 'kaash' dhaatu se nishpann he isaliye kashika kaa arth 'prakashit karne vaali' yaa 'prakashika' hua 
 According to Kashyadha lecturer Harddutt, the second interpretation is that Kashika was composed in Kashi, hence it was called Kashika
 yah jayaditya or vaaman naam ke do vidwaanon kii sammilit kriti he
 Both the Chinese traveler Etshing and the author of the linguistic-semantics Srishyadharacharya have written not only Jayaditya Vritikas to Kashika, but many ancient scholars have mentioned both Jayaditya and Vamana while quoting Kashika
 unke apane-apane likhe adhyyon par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he
 The first, second, fifth and best chapters of Jayaditya have been written and the remaining parts of Vamana have been written in the word 'ratnarnavya' of Adult Manorama
 parantu kashika kii lekhanstyli ko dhyanpurvak dekhne se prathit hota he ki aarambh ke paanch adhyay jayaditya virachit hai or ant ke teen vaaman ke likhe hai
 On the basis of some concrete evidence, it has been assumed that Jayaditya and Vamana composed their various complete vrittis on the entire Ashtadhyayi
 par yah abhi rahasy hi he ki kab or kaise kuch ansh jayaditya ke or kuch vaaman ke lekar yah kashika bani
 Yet it is certified that this integration of vrittis had already taken place before Vikram Samvat 700
 kashika ke vyakhyagranth Many scholars have written commentaries on Kashika
