 Leaders are also reaching out to tribal areas and seeking votes to get votes in elections
 pradesh kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne bhi apni gaurav yatra kii shuruyaat adivasee kshetra se hi kii thi, jahaan bhil jati kaa bahulya he
 Bhil caste voters play an important role in 16 out of 28 seats of Mewar in Rajasthan and they play an important role in the victory or defeat of any party or leader
 vaise to bhil jati kii bahulata dakshini rajasthan yani duungarpur, bansawada, pratapgarh or udaipur ke gramin kshetron main he, lekin dhundhar ke kota kshetra main bhi bhil samaaj ke log rahete hai
 The history of the Bhil caste coming into the Scheduled Tribes category is also very old
 kaha jaataa he ki bheelon ne hi ladaai main maharana pratap kaa saath diya tha
 The word Bhil is derived from 'beal', which means 'command'
 kai log bheelon ko vanaputra bhi kehete hai
 Bhil tribe is the main ancient tribe of Rajasthan
 jis prakaar uttari rajasthan main rajputon ke udai se pehle meenon ke rajya rahe, usee prakaar dakshini rajasthan or hadoti pradesh main bheelon ke anek chote-chote rajya rahe hai
 The term Bhil was used to refer to a particular class of people who hunted with bow and arrow and kept their stomachs
 kaha jaataa he ki eklavya bhi bhil tha
 Third major tribe: Bhil is the third largest tribe in the country
 kai kitabon main kaha gaya he ki bhil ke khun se tilak karne ke baad hi raja gaddi par baithte the
 The Bhil worshipers of the tree consider mango and peepal to be prominent
 bheelon ke reeti-rivaaj bhi kaaphi alag hote hai or is janajati main shaadi kii rasm 9 din tak chalati he
 People of this society speak Bhili and Wagdi languages
 rajasthan ke duungarpur, bansawada or udaipur kaa kuch kshetra 'vaagad' kehalaata he
 Vagad is a tribal dominated area
 bhil atyant paramparawaadi jati he, jo apane saamaajik or aarthik str ko lekar sajag rahati he
 The people of Bhil caste have strongly opposed the British to other rulers and have played an important role in many battles of history
 ab jabaki rajasthan ek baar phir nai sarkaar kaa chunaav karne ja rahaa he, aise main vahaan bhil janajati kaa role bhi nirnaayak sabit hoga

 congress netaa kaa yah virodh pradarshan shivaraj singh chouhan dwaara deshadroh kahe jane ke jawaab main aayaa he
 In fact, during a press conference in Satna district, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan called Digvijay Singh as a traitor

 They address him as 'G'
 kai baar digvijay singh ke ye kadam mujhe deshadrohi lagate hai
 Digvijay Singh objected to this statement of Shivraj and wrote a letter to him on 21 July
 digvijay sinhane khat main likhaa tha, 'mukhyamantri shivaraj singh mujhe deshadrohi maanate hai
 As far as i know, i have not done any such work, due to which i fall in the category of 'traitor' in the eyes of the Chief Minister sitting on the constitutional post
 ' digvijay singh ne kaha tha, 'siem shivaraj singh chouhan ke paas mere deshadrohi hone ke jo bhi saboot hai, unhen wo prashasan ko saunp den, taaki meri giraftaar ho sake or mujh par cese darj karne main koi rukaawat naa aae

 jab wo apane hajaaron samarthakon ke saath titi nagar police stesan kii ore bad rahe the, tabhi kuch duuri par unako roak diya gaya
 However, later Digigjay Singh along with some of his supporters was allowed inside the police station
 is dauraan purv mukhyamantri singh ne police ko giraftaar karne kii chunauti di
 Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh said, 'I have come here to arrest myself
 agar mukhyamantri sochate hai ki main deshadrohi hum, to unako mujhe fouran giraftaar karwaanaa chahie
 He said that the reason for such rhetoric of Shivraj Singh is that he and his family are fully involved in many scams like Vyapam
 ab aagaamee chunaav main pradesh kii janata shivaraj singh ko ukhaad phenkegi
 After this, the police gave in writing that there is no allegation, trial or complaint of treason against Digvijay Singh

 police sutron ke mutabik atik ahamed ke kai kareebi baahar se logon ko jabaran uthaa kar laate the or jail ke bheetar atik ko saunp dete the
 The jail administration was also involved in this work
 kyonki atik se milane aane ke liye kisi bhi shaks kii koi poochtacha yaa talaashi nahin hoti thi
 Atiq's atrocities were also known to the jail authorities and the entire jail administration, but no one dared to open his mouth
 philhal, is maamle main atik ko devaria jail se shift karke bareli kii jail bhej diya gaya he or krime branch uske tamaam duusare maamalon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 It is worth noting that the case came to light when a former MP of Bahubali in Deoria district jail, Atiq Ahmed, not only kidnapped a real state businessman of Lucknow, but also broke his fingers by calling him inside the Deoria jail

 According to the police, about a fortnight later on August 10, the accused woman again forced the victim to undergo the same rape
 uske baad peedita ne apane pati ko sari baat bataai or donon police ke paas pahunche
 The police have arrested the accused couple

 Women have been playing the World Cup in a similar way since 2009, even though Pakistan may not be as strong in 50-over games as Australia / New Zealand / India / England but they can do well if they get support
 For context, Pakistan women only played their 1st ODI in 1997, nearly 20 yrs after India (1 / 2)

 puraane lakhanu kii imaaraton ke bich ek daastango ko sunne ke liye baari bheed jamaa he
 Kadardan is wooing by seeing a young man with a beard on his face in a white cloth holding onto Urdu tongue
 tabhi yah daastango shaayar vali aasi kaa ek sher sunaakar sabko daastaan sunaane kii ahmiyat kuch yun bayaan karata he, ''kabhi bhuule se bhi ab yaad bhi aati nahin jinaki, vahi kisse jamaane ko sunaanaa chaahate hai ham
 "it is Himanshu Bajpai, who is one of the most well-known dastangoi artists in the country
" daastangoi yani urdu main khaas andaaj kii lambii kahaniyaan sunaane kii kala
 It is an art associated with the Vachic tradition which was in its youth in the medieval period but ended around 1928
 2005 main urdu aalochak shamsurrahman faruki or ustad mahmud faruki kii koshishon se yah kala dobaaraa jinda hui
 In the later years, Himanshu Bajpayee of Lucknow is the young man who is associated with this art
 inke paas beshumaar kahaniyaan hai
 New-old, small-big, laughing, crying
 
 
 har tarah kii kahaniyaan
 When they narrate the story, time, dialogues, characters and events come to life and the listeners also become the characters of the same story
 kakori cond or krantikariyon kii daastaan, gandhi ji kii daastaan, falon ke raja aam kii daastaan, caphi azmi kii daastaan, aadi unki kuch mashhoor dastaanen hai
 Apart from performing more than seventy shows in different cities of India, he has done many shows in different places in Turkey, UAE and Singapore etc
 isi saal ve net-flikes kii ati-lokapriy siries secred games ke sijan 2 main bhi daastaan sunaate najar aae
 Apart from Dastangoi, he also has a strong identity as a writer
 raajakmal prakaashan se isi saal ai unki kitaab kissa-kissa lakhanuva chhapate hi bestceller ho gai
 In just seven months, three versions of it have arrived
 is kitaab main bhi kissagoi hi he
 However, despite having no experience or background at all, belonging to a middle-class family in Lucknow, it was not easy for Himanshu to succeed as a full-time professional dastango
 daastangoi shuru karne se pehle himanshu patrakarita kar chuke the
 Answering how he came to Dastangoi from journalism, he explains, "my friend Marhum Ankit Chadha, who has been the best and the best of our generation, took me by hand and brought me to Dastangoi
" main jo jis tarah kahana chahta tha, patrakarita main vah kahana mushkil ho rahaa tha, isi vakt ankit ne mujhe daastaan kehane kii prerana di
 Then Ankit took me to Ustad Mahmood Farooqui and in 2013 joined his workshop of Dastangoi
 ''is tarah daastango ke rup main himanshu kaa safar shuru hua
 His first story with Ankit in 2014 proved to be the turning point of his life
 isko sunaane main unhen jo anand aayaa or sunne waalon kaa jo rispons mila, uske baad himanshu ne tay kar liya ki ab or kuch nahin karnaa, phul time sirf daastaan sunaani he
 When he told in his house that he does not want to do any further job and is adopting Dastangoi as a full time profession, then there was concern in the house
 unke pita arun kumaar bajpeyi jo ki ek sarkari adhyaaapak or kisaan hai, shuruyaat main chaahate the ki himanshu naukari ke saath daastangoi bhi karen
 But gradually, when the success was achieved, the father's anxiety decreased
 in dinon himanshu kuch nai dastaanen taiyaar karne main masaroof hai, jinamein se ek unke mehboob shahar lakhanu par he
 At the same time, his dream is to narrate the story through the country by road
 ve kehete hai ki daastangoi kaa mustakabil raushan he kyonki bharat kahaniyon kaa gahavaara he
 This land has been coming for thousands of years to those who narrate stories and stories
 unki kamyaabi kii vajah bhi yahi he
 Struggling to establish himself as a struggling Time dastangoturning Point 2014, Shire Majaz Ki Dastan with Ankit chadhaavailableamayak Dastango, author of the bestseller anecdote Kishan Lucknowwa, should work with full dedication to know the work of his tradition on popular Hindi literature
 Hold, talent of talent, writing *** dopaher ke teen baj chuke hai
 The curtain rises from the stage
 saamne ek 'insaan' baitha dikhaai detaa he
 He is wearing shirt-pants and court
 pair main juute bhi hai
 Sitting quietly in the chair, this man stares towards the viewing gallery

 professor ne kaha ki aaj ke zyaadaatar robot simit taur par gum-phir sakate hai, lekin aane vaale dinon main aise robot aaenge, jo zyada 'active' honge
 Future robots will do more work for humans
 Heinrich says that future robots will have more networking capabilities
 nishchit taur par ye zyada intellegent honge, apni pansad ke saath zyada suchanaaen saajha kar sakenge
 There will be living tissues in them, so that they will be able to take decisions themselves

 After telling this much, the professor also puts some questions in front of the people
 kya bhavishya ke in robot ko soshal security number kii jarurat honi chahie? kya robot ko passport ishyu kiye jane chahie? jawaab bhi professor hi dete hai
 They say, let these machines inspire us, so that we can think more creatively, because the most precious gift of nature on us is humans
