 Kalidas was a great Sanskrit poet and playwright
 unhone bharat kii puranic kathaon or darshan ko aadhaar banaakar rachanaaen kii or unki rachanaaon main bhartiya jivan or darshan ke vividh rup or mul tatva nirupit hai
 Kalidas is considered a poet who gives voice to the overall national consciousness of the nation due to these characteristics and some scholars even place him as a national poet
 abhigyanshakuntalam kalidas kii sabase prasiddh rachana he
 The play is one of the few Indian literary works first translated into European languages
 yah puure vishwa sahitya main agraganya rachana maani jaati he
 Meghdootam is the best work of Kalidasa in which the poet's imagination and expressiveism, the power of expression, is at its best and the amazing humanization of nature is seen in Khandakavya
 kalidas vaidarbhi reeti ke kavi hai or tadnurup ve apni alankaar yukt kintu saral or madhur bhashaa ke liye vishesh rup se jane jate hai
 His nature descriptions are unique and are particularly known for his similes
 sahitya main audaarya gun ke prati kalidas kaa vishesh prem he or unhone apane shringaar ras pradhan sahitya main bhi adarshavaadi parampara or naitik mulyon kaa samuchit dhyaan rakhaa he
 Kalidasa's later poet Banabhatta has particularly praised her words
 kalidas kis kaal main hue or ve multah kis sthaan ke the isamen kaafii vivaad he
 Since Kalidasa wrote the play Malavikagnimitram by making the second Sunga ruler Agnimitra a hero and Agnimitra ruled in 170 BC, there is a limit to the time of Kalidasa that they could not have happened before
 chhathin sadi isvi main banbhatta ne apni rachana harshcharitam main kalidas kaa ullekh kiya he tathaa isi kaal ke pulakeshin dwitiya ke ehole abhilekh main kalidas kaa zikr he atah ve inke baad ke nahin ho sakate
 Thus Kalidasa is scheduled to be between the first century BCE to the sixth century AD
 durbhagyavash is samay seemaa ke andar ve kab hue is par kaafii matbhed hai
 Among the scholars, the second century BCE vote, the first century BC, the third century AD, the fourth century AD, the fifth century AD, and the sixth century AD; Were prevalent
 inamen zyaadaatar khandit ho chuke hai yaa unhen maanane vaale ikke dukke log hai kintu mukhya sangharsh 'pratham shatabdi isa purv kaa mat or 'chaturth shatabdi isvi kaa mat' main he
 First century BC opinion - parampara ke anusaar kalidas ujjayini ke un raja vikramaditya ke samakaleen hai jinhone isa se 57 varsh purv vikram sanwat chalaaya
 The change in the name of Vikramorvashiyya's hero Pururava to Vikrama reinforces the argument that Kalidasa was the royal court poet of King Vikramaditya of Ujjayini
 inhen vikramaditya ke navratnon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Fourth Century AD - pro kith or anya itihaaskaar kalidas ko gupt shaasha chandragupta vikramaditya or unke uttaradhikari kumargupta se jodate hai, jinka shasankaal chauthi shatabdi main tha
 It is believed that Chandragupta II took the title of Vikramaditya and his reign is considered to be the golden age
 vivaad or paksh-pratipaksh - There is also controversy about the birthplace of Kalidasa
 meghdutam main ujjain ke prati unki vishesh prem ko dekhte hue kuch log unhen ujjain kaa nivasee maanate hai
 Writers have also tried to prove that Kalidas was born in Kaviltha village in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand
 kalidas ne yaheen apni praarambhik shiksha grahan kii thi auki yaheen par unhone meghdoot, kumarasambhav auki raghuvansh jaise mahakavyon kii rachana kii thi
 Kaviltha is located in Guptkashi on the Chardham Yatra route
 guptkashi se kalimath siddhapitha vaale raste main kalimath mandir se chaar kilometre aage kaviltha gaanv sthit he
 In Kaviltha, the government has also established an auditorium by installing a statue of Kalidas
 jahaan par har saal june maah main teen dinon tak goshtee kaa aayojan hota he, jisamen deshbhar ke vidwaan bhaag lete hai
 Some scholars have even tried to prove them of Bengal and Orissa
 kehete hai ki kalidas kii srilanka main hatya kar di gai thi lekin vidwaan ise bhi kapol-kalpit maanate hai
 According to legends and legend, Kalidas was beautiful from shaklo-surat and was one of the Navratnas of Vikramaditya's court
 kaha jaataa he ki praarambhik jivan main kalidas anpadh or murkh the
 Kalidas is married to a princess named Vidyottama
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki vidyottama ne pratigya kii thi ki jo koi use shastrarth main haraa degaa, vah usee ke saath shaadi karegi
 When Vidyottama defeated all the scholars in the debate, saddened by the insult, some scholars got Kalidasa to debate him
 vidyottama maun shabdaawalee main gudh prashn puuchhati thi, jise kalidas apni buddhi se maun sanketon se hi jawaab de dete the
 Vidyottama felt that Kalidas was giving a deep answer to the esoteric question
 udhaaharan ke liye vidyottama ne prashn ke rup main khulaa haath dikhaaya to kalidas ko laga ki yah thappad maarane kii dhamkee de rahi he
 In response to this, Kalidasa showed a punch, Vidyottama felt that he is saying that even though the five senses are different, all are governed by one mind
 vidyottama or kalidas kaa vivaah ho gaya tab vidyottama ko sachai kaa pataa chalaa ki kalidas anpadh hai
 He cursed Kalidas and drove him out of the house saying that he would not return home without becoming a true Pandit
 kalidas ne sachche man se kaali devi kii aradhana kii or unke aashirwad se ve gyani or dhanwaan ban gaye
 When he returned home after gaining knowledge, he knocked on the door and said - Kapatam Udghatya Sundari
 vidyottama ne chakit hokar kaha -- asti kashchid vagvisheshah 
 Thus, according to this legend, Kalidasa considered Vidyottama as his pioneer master and gave this sentence a place in his poetry
 kumarasambhavam kaa prarambh hota he- astyuttarasyam dishi


 se, meghdutam kaa pehla shabd he- kashchitkanta


 or raghuvansham kii shuruyaat hoti he- vagarthviv


 se
 There are about forty compositions, small and big, which different scholars have tried to prove to be composed by Kalidasa
 inamen se maatr saat hi aisi hai jo nirvivaad rup se kalidaskrut mani jaati hai: teen naatak: abhigyaan shaakuntalam, vicramorvasium or malvicagnimitram; do mahakavy: raghuvansham or kumarasambhavam; or do khandakavy: meghdutam or rutusanhaar
 Even among these, Prof
 Keith accepts Kalidasa's composition with skepticism
 malvicagnimitram kalidas kii pehali rachana he, jisamen raja agnimitra kii kahani he
 Agnimitra falls in love with the portrait of Malavika, the daughter of an exiled servant
 jab agnimitra kii patni ko is baat kaa pataa chalata he to vah malvika ko jail main dalava detii he
 But Malavika, incidentally, proves to be a princess and her love affair is accepted
 abhigyaan shaakuntalam kalidas kii duusari rachana he jo unki jagatprasiddhi kaa kaaran bana
 The play has been translated into many languages of the world besides English and German
 isamen raja dushyant kii kahani he jo van main ek parityakt rishi putree shakuntala se prem karne lagata he
 Both the Gandharvas get married in the forest
 raja dushyant apni rajdhani laut aate hai
 Meanwhile, the sage Durvasa curses Shakuntala that in whose disconnection he insulted the sage, he will forget him
 kaaphi kshamaprarthana ke baad rishi ne shaap ko thodaa naram karte hue kaha ki raja kii anguthi unhen dikhaate hi sab kuch yaad aa jayega
 But on the way to the capital, that ring is lost
 sthiti tab or gambhir ho gai jab shakuntla ko pataa chalaa ki vah garbhvatee he
 Shakuntala Lakh Gidgidai but the king refused to recognize him
 jab ek machuaare ne vah anguthi dikhaayi to raja ko sab kuch yaad aayaa or raja ne shakuntla ko apana liya
 Shakuntala Shringar is a unique play of beautiful poetry filled with juice
 kaha jaataa he kavyeshu naatakan ramyan tatra ramya shakuntala Vikramorvashiyam is a mystery drama
 isamen pururava indralok kii apsara urvashi se prem karne lagate hai
 Seeing Pururava's love, Urvashi also starts loving her
 indra kii sabha main jab urvashi nrity karne jaati he to pururava se prem ke kaaran vah vahaan acha pradarshan nahin kar paati he
 With this, Indra angrily curses him and sends him to the earth
 haalanki, uskaa premi agar usase hone vaale putr ko dekh le to vah phir swarg laut sakegi
 Vikramorvashiyam is full of poetic beauty and craft
 kumarasambhavam unke mahakavyon ke naam he
 Raghuvansham contains the stories of the kings of the entire Raghuvansh, then Kumarasambhavaam contains the love story of shiva-parvati and the story of the birth of Kartikeya

 inke alaava kai chhitput rachanaaon kaa shrey kalidas ko diya jaataa he, lekin vidwaanon kaa mat he ki ye rachanaaen anya kaviyon ne kalidas ke naam se kii
 Apart from the playwright and poet, Kalidas is also considered an expert in astrology
 uttar kalamritam naamak jyotish pustika kii rachana kaa shrey kalidas ko diya jaataa he
 It is believed that he gained knowledge of astrology by worshiping Kali Devi
 is pustika main kii gai bhavishyavaanee satya sabit huin
 Kalidasa has been given commendatory titles such as Kavikulaguru, Kannikikadhishitha and Kavitakaminavilas only after being overwhelmed by his poetic specialties
 kalidas ke kavy kii vishistataaon kaa varnan nimnavat kiya ja saktaa he: Kalidas is a poet of the Vaidarbhi tradition and has used the full fine word plan from the Prasad property
 prasad gun kaa lakshan he - "jo gun man main vaise hi vyaapt ho jaay jaise sukhi eendhan kii lakdi main agni sahasaa prajvalit ho uthati he" or kalidas kii bhashaa kii yahi visheshta he
 Kalidasa's language is full of melodious nad sundari and due to qualities like the use of samasas, the proper use of terms, the natural use of words, etc
, it has fluency and vibrancy
 kalidas ne shabdalankaron kaa swaabhaavik prayog kiya he or unhen upama alankaar ke prayog main siddhhast or unki upamaaon ko shreshth mana jaataa he

 The term duty generally refers to the tasks a person is morally committed to do
 is shabd se vah bodh hota he ki vyakti kisi kaary ko apni ichha, anichhaa yaa keval bahya dabaav ke kaaran nahin karata he apitu aantarik naitik prarena ke hi kaaran karata he
 Therefore, there is motivation of principle or purpose in the aspect of duty

 is par ni:swaarthta kaa asfoot chhap he
 Duty is another term for human responsibility to do or not to do any work
 kartavya do prakaar ke hote hai- naitik tathaa kanoonee
 Moral duties are those which are concerned with the moral sense of humanity, the motivation of conscience or the tendency to do proper work
 is shrenee ke kartavyon kaa sarankshan rajya dwaara nahin hota
 If a human does not perform these duties, then his / her own conscience may reject him / her, or the society may condemn him / her but the state cannot compel him / her to perform these duties
 satyabhaashan, santan sangrakshan, sadvyavahaar, ye naitik kartavya ke udhaaharan hai
 The legal duties are those which the citizen is liable to punish by the state for non-compliance
 inhen kartavyon kaa adhyayan raajnneetik shaastra main hota he
 Hindu political science does not describe rights
 usamen kartavyon kaa hi ullekh hua he
 Duties are the center of ethics
 adhikaar or kartavya kaa bada ghanishtha sambandh he
 In fact, rights and duties are two sides of the same substance
 jab ham kehete hai ki amuk vyakti kaa amuk vastu par adhikaar he, to iskaa doosraa arth yah bhi hota he ki anya vyaktiyon kaa kartavya he ki us vastu par apana adhikaar na samajhakar usapar us vyakti kaa hi adhikaar samajhen
 Hence duties and rights are concomitant
 jab ham yah samajhate hai ki samaaj or rajya main rahakar hamaare kuch adhikaar ban jate hai to hamen yah bhi samajhnaa chahie ki samaaj or rajya main rahete hue hamaare kuch kartavya bhi hai
 Mandatory rights are closely related to compulsory duties

 Rights are those social conditions and opportunities which are necessary for the highest development of a person's personality

 On 15 August 2010, the Taj Mahal Palace was reopened after repairs

 On 6 November, United States President Barack Obama became the first foreign head of state to reside in the Taj Mahal Palace after the attacks

8333580493927 The Treaty of Versailles took place at the end of the First World War between Germany and the coalition countries
 pratham vishwayuddh ke baad parajeet germany ne 28 june 1919 ke din varsay kii sandhi par hastakshar kiye
 This led to Germany losing a large part of its land, banning the occupation of other states, limiting the size of their army and imposing heavy compensation
 varsay kii sandhi ko germany par jabardastee thopa gaya tha
 For this reason Adolf Hitler and other Germans considered it disgraceful and thus the treaty was one of the causes of World War II
 paris shanti sammelan main anekanek sandhiyon evam samjhauton kaa masavida taiyaar kiya gaya or un par hastakshar kiye gayi, lekin in sabhi sandhiyon main germany ke saath jo varsay kii sandhi hui vah anek drushtiyon se mahatvapurn he or sabhi sandhi main pramukh he
 After four months of hard work, the contract of the treaty was ready
 230 prishthon main ankit yah sandhi 15 bhaagon main vibhakt thi or usamen 440 dharaayen thim
 On 6 May 1919, it appeared before the conference and was approved
 30 april ko hi videsh-mantri count phon brokaduf rantaju ke netritv main german pratinidhi-mandal varsay pahunchaa
 The delegates were held at the Tryon Palace Hotel
 mitrarashtron ke afasar unki suraksha kii dekhbhaal kar rahe the
 The hotel was surrounded by barbed wire and German representatives were forbidden to contact any representative of the Allies or any journalist
 7 may ko climeshon ne anya pratinidhi-mandalon ke samaksh, trayanan hotel main, german pratinidhi mandal ke sammukh sandhi kaa masavida prastut kiya
 He was given only two weeks to discuss this issue
 germany ko kisi bhi tarah sandhi par hastakshar karnaa hi tha
 German politicians seriously considered the treaty issue and after 26 days submitted an opposing proposal of sixty thousand words on their behalf
 germany ne is baat kii shikaayat kii thi ki usne jin sharton par aatmasamarpan kiya tha, prastaavit sandhi main un siddhanton kaa ulanghan hua he
 He said that the new government of Germany is completely democratic and is interested in membership of the League of Nations
 nirastrikaran kii shart keval germany par hi nahin, apitu samast rajyon par lagu kii jaani chahie
 It is wrong to hold sole Germany responsible for the World War
 german prastaav main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki sandhi kii sabhi sharton ko maananaa asambhav he
 Permanent peace cannot be established by crushing and enslaving a large nation
 mitrarashtron ne germany ke prastaavon par vichaar kiya or kuch chote-mote parivartan ke baad germany ko paanch dinon ke bheetar hi sanshodhit sandhi par hastakshar karne ko kaha gaya
 This time Germany was not given the opportunity to submit any amendment or request regarding the terms of the treaty
 mitrarashtron ne spasht kar diya tha ki hastakshar nahin karne kaa arth germany par punah akraman hoga
 Finally, the German government accepted the signing of the treaty
 rashtrasang kaa nirmaan evam sanghathan varsay-sandhi kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn ang tha
 The first part of the treaty is related to this
 yah multah raashtrapati wilson kaa srijan tha
 He thought that the League of Nations should be the greatest work of peace conference
 lid jorge ne likhaa he wilson shanti-sandhiyon ke keval us bhaag ko jisamen rashtrasang kii vyavastha thi, sabase adhik mahatv detaa tha
 For this, he was ready to make any sacrifice and in the end it was due to his hard efforts that the League of Nations was created
 wilson ko chhodkar mitrarashtra ke anya pratinidhiyon kaa yah vichaar tha ki rashtrasang sambandhi baton ko varsay-sandhi ke antargat rakhana aavashyak nahin he
 Eventually Wilson agreed and the Constitution of the League of Nations was placed under the Treaty of Versailles
 varsay-sandhi kii pratham 26 dharaayen rashtrasang kaa samvidhan hi he, jiskaa uddeshy anterrashtriya sahyog ko badhanaa tathaa anterrashtriya shanti or suraksha ko kaayam rakhana tha
 elsas-laurent Territory: Germany was disbanded by territorial changes by the Treaty of Versailles
 1871 main germany ne france se alses-lauren ke pradesh chin liye the

 The responsibility of the governance of this region was entrusted to the League of Nations but ownership of coal mines was given to France
 yah bhi tay hua ki 15 varshon baad janamat sangrah dwaara nishchit kiya jayega ki saar kshetra ke log germany ke saath rahanaa chaahate hai yaa france ke saath
 If the Saravians express a desire to meet with Germany, Germany will repurchase the mines by paying a fixed price to France

 The Allies decided to create an independent Poland state
 danging ko swatantra nagar ke rup main parivartit kiya gaya or use raashtra sangh ke sangrakshan main rakh diya gaya
 Poland was empowered to use the port of Dajing to provide sea passage

 Germany recognized the Kingdom of Czechoslovakia
 is prakaar pradeshik vyavastha ke tahat germany ko 25 hajaar varg mile kaa pradesh or 70 lakh kii aabaadi khoni padi
 German Colonial System: The Allies wanted the German colonies to meet in their respective empires, but Wilson strongly opposed it
 wilson ke virodh ke kaaran mitra rashtron ne sangrakshan pranali kii shuruuaat kii
 It was meant that the welfare and development of the countries which are very backward
 sabhy rashtron main pavitra dharohar ke rup rashtrasang kii ore se isaki unnati ke liye diya janaa chahie
 Germany had to leave all its colonies under the Mindet system and was placed under the protection of the Allies
 prashanth mahaasaagar ke kai dwipon tathaa africa mahadeshon main sthit upnivesh germany ko khone pade
 The maximum number of the German army was increased to one lakh

 pandubbiyon ko mitra rashtron ko saunpane kii baat kii gai
 To follow and monitor this system of disarmament, a Allied Military Commission was established at the expense of Germany
 is prakaar sainik drushti se germany ko pangu bana diya gaya
 Under the 231st Section of the Versailles Treaty, Germany and its allied states were held sole responsible for the war
 atah mitrarashtron ko yuddh main jo kshatipurti uthaani padi thi, uske liye germany ko kshatipurti karne ko kaha gaya ki 1921 tak germany 5 arab dollars mitrarashtron ko de
 The Allies were given special facilities on import and export of some goods from Germany
 nil nahar kaa anterrashtriyakaran kar use sabhi jahaajon ke liye khulaa chhod diya gaya
 According to the 231st section of the treaty, Germany was held liable for all the damage and war
 raajnneetik vyavastha ke antargat rashtrasang kii sthapana varsay kii sandhi kaa mahatvapurn ang thi
 It was because of Wilson's influence that the League of Nations was placed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 rashtrasang kaa uddeshy anterrashtriya sahyog evam suraksha ko kaayam karnaa tha
 In many treaties in world history, the Treaty of Versailles has been the most described and disputed
 vastutah is sandhi ne vishwa itihaas kii dhara ko gahare rup se prabhavit kiya
 These treaties are sharply criticized and understood as the seeds of this Second World War
 nimna binduon ke tahat is sandhi kii aalochana ko dekha ja saktaa he- 1
 Accused Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw is known as the "accusatory peace", that is, the "accusatory treaty"
 sandhi ko taiyaar karte samay sammelan main germany ko sthaan nahin diya gaya
 This was the order of the Allies which Germany had no other remedy except to accept
 german pratinidhiyon ke dwaara sikaayat karne par bhi unhen dhamkee di gayi kii yadi ve paanch din ke andar sandhi par hastakshar nahin kiye to unke khilaaf punah akraman kar diya jaayegaa
 Therefore, it sat on the mind of Germany that it is an alleged treaty which they are not obliged to obey
 yahi vajah he ki germany ne aage chalakar sandhi praavdhaanon ko thukraa diya
 2
 No peace of public, peace of diplomats: The provisions mentioned in the Treaty of Versailles could not fulfill the interests and aspirations of the general public
 isamen kai aisi pradeshik vyavasthaayen thi jisamen sanshodhan kii jarurat thi
 Several provisions were made in compensation that could not be recovered without causing devastating blow to the industrial revival of Europe
 is tarah jansadharan kii shanti kaa yah sandhi puraa nahin karti
 3
 Strict and Disgraceful Conditions: Germany was shattered by the Treaty of Warsaw, the colonies were stripped financially, the ownership of other nations over economic resources, and the military was crippled
 
 kshatipurti kii shart atyant kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 In the event of non-payment of compensation amount, there was talk of occupying the territories of Germany
 vastutah vijeta raashtra ne pratishodh ke tahat kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 The terms of the treaty were so harsh that no self-respecting, cultured nation could bear it
 churchill ke shabdon main “isaki aarthik sharten is had tak kalankapurna tathaa nirbuddha thi ki unhone ne ise spashtatya nirarthak bana diya
 " 4
 sandhi galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi : yah sandhi keval asaamaanya rup se kathor nahin thi, varan galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi
 The attempt by Germany to approve so-called war crime provisions was beyond reality because, as David Thomson put it, "mentioning this in a draft that the German delegates were forced to sign cannot create a sense of sense of responsibility
" Were
 ” duusare kshatipurti kii maang bhi asambhav maatra main kii gai thi or isaki vrihat raashi bina kisi gambhir vichaar kiye nishchit kii gai thi
 How it would be possible for the Germans to repay this wealth economically and for the Allies was not analyzed
 nihsandeh dand or muaavje kaa sampurna aakaar aviveki or avyavhaarik tha
 All the above mentioned unnecessary rigors did not take any distinct action against Germany's ability to express national dissatisfaction and anger
 yah sandhi galat tareeke se naram thi, 'saar kshetra' kaa raashtra sangh dwaara 15 varsh tak shashan or 1935 main use germany kaa lautaa dena shaayad hi uchit tha
 The authority of the Allies on Rhineland for 15 years also proved hollow
 5
 pratishodhatmak sandhi : vijeta rashtron ne pratishodhatmak ravaiya apanaakar kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 France was seeking to avenge its old defeat and non-compliance, so that the treaty made the most stringent provisions with Germany
 6
 apmanjanak sandhi : yah sandhi germany ke liye rashtriya apmaan kaa kaaran thi
 The overthrow of Kaiser William, recovery of heavy damage supply
 mitra rajyon kaa german taton, karakhono, nadiyon adi par adhikaar or senaaon kii germany main upastithi, germany kaa vibhaajan,upniveshon kii mitra deshon dwaara lut tathaa bhedbhaavpurn, asmaan,anyaaypurna sharten adi sabhi apmanjanak to the hi
 Clemenceau's indecent behavior with German delegates coming for the signing of treaty letters, keeping them as prisoners, abusing the public, throwing rotten fruit, bricks, stones at them, was not an insult to the delegates but to Germany
 7
 vishwasghaatee sandhi : varsay kii sandhi naitik drushti se anuchit va germany ke saath vishwasghaat maani gai
 Germany had accepted a war tax treaty based on Wilson's 14 sources, but these treaties of Wilson were openly violated in the Treaty of Warsaw
 germany ke saath rashtriyata ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin hua tha
 Many conditions were imposed on him
 lekin vijetaon ko usase mukt rakhaa gaya he
 According to Wilson's third source, the attempt was to remove all barriers to international trade, but Germany's collective freedom was not protected
 uskaa antarrashtriya vyapaar varshon tak mitrarashtron ke niyantran main rahaa
 The 14 sources suggested the reduction of arms of all nations, but the Allies severely limited Germany's military power without reducing their arms
 mitra rashtron ne wilson ke 14 sutron kaa paalan usee seemaa tak kiya jahaan tak unhen laabh tha
 Thus Germany was betrayed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 is vishwasghaat kaa badla lene ke liye aage germany ne yuddh kiya
 8
 Ideological Conflicts among the Prophets of the Treaty: The Treaty of Varsay provided a status of conflict among the three elders' opinions and objectives
 wilson ke ucch parantu avyaavhaarik vichaar, climenso ke rashtravaadi va yathartwaadee maangon tathaa lid george ke avasarwaadi uddeshyon ke bich virodh tha, baavjood iske varsay kii sandhi par inaki sahmati thi jo inke samrajyavaadee va shoshan kii maansikta ko pratibibint karata he
 According to Logson "there was intense opposition to Wilson's idealism and materialism of convention, and in most cases materialism emerged victorious
" ” 9
 Beginning of new phase of Conflict: The Treaty of Warsaw marked the beginning of a new struggle for universal power among European nations
 1919 tak anterrashtriya vidhi kisi desh kii sarkaar tathaa uske nagarikon kii sampatti main bhed maanati thi
 But according to the treaty of Warsay, the warring country could seize some kind of property of a person of an enemy country within the border of himself and his allies
 yadi vah yuddh main vijayi hua to parajeet desh kii sarkaar ko apane nagarikon kii idas prakaar jabt kii gai sampatti kii kshatipurti karne ke liye baadhya kar saktaa tha
 This was a new parable
 10
 wimer ganatantr ke prati ghrinaa : yuddh ke baad germany main wimer ganatantr kii sthapana hui or use varsay kii sandhi se jodakar dekha gaya
 Among all the liberal features, it was considered as an institution established by the enemy party
 isliye germany main prajatantr aarambh se hi dwandv, ghrinapatr va shatrupaksh kii vyavastha ban gaya
 11
 Disregard of the principle of self-determination: The boundaries of Italy were not set on the principle of nationalism, nor were all citizens on Poland's land unquestionably polled
 isi prakaar turki ke samrajya ke bhaagon ko surakshit samprabhutaa kaa vachan nahin diya gaya
 The League of Nations was unable to grant political sovereignty as large and small states
 is sandhi ke naitik paksh va yukti sangatta ke vishay main e
je
pi
 tailor kaa kathan he ki “prarambh se hi varsay kii sandhi main naitik manyata kaa abhaav tha
 The doctrine of self-judgment concerning Germany was disregarded
 raashtrapati wilson ke aatmanirnay ke siddhant ke anusaar europe ke anek rashtron kaa punargathan kiya gaya tha
 According to this, it was decided to create a separate system of people of the same nation, caste, language and cultural tradition
 isi aadhaar par checkoslovakia, poland, yugoslavia ke swatantra rajyon kaa janm hua
 But this principle was not followed in relation to Germany, Austria and Hungary
 germany ke hajaaron nagarikon ko german samrajya se pruthak karke anya rajyon ke adheen kar diya gaya
 "in 1918 AD, when the Austrian Germans established the german-austrian Republic and expressed the desire of the Germans to join the Republic and annex the land, the Allied States banned the annexation of the two states in September 1919 AD
 Gone
 is prakaar mitra rashtron dwaara swayan dwaara sweekrut siddhant ko germany ke vishay main kriyanvit na kar german nagarikon ko niraash kiya gaya
 According to Butlerne, "not using the principle of self-determination in a reasonable sense was an indication of the inherent weakness in the Parisian system
" ” The treaty of Versailles has a special place in the most discussed treaties of world history and its effects
 us sandhi ke kathor praavdhaanon or uske swaroop ke sandarbh main aalochakon ne ise dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, the Treaty of Warsaw was the father of discontent rather than a system of peace
 sandhi ke thik 20 varsh 2 maheene 4 din pashchaat yah sansar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke chapet main aa gaya
 Since the treaty, its arrangements were disbanded by Germany
 saath hi sandhi praavdhaanon main sanshodhan bhi kiye jate rahe
 Violations and amendments of these treaty provisions pushed the world towards World War II
 sandhi praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan evam sanshodhan isliye kiya gaya ki yah atyadhik kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 No self-respecting nation could tolerate the terms of such a harsh and degrading treaty for a long time
 atah yah spasht tha ki germany bhavishya main uparyukt avasar milte hi varsay sandhi dwaara thopi gai vyavastha se mukt hone tathaa apmaan ke kalank dhone kaa prayaas karegaa
 Ezberger of the Catholic Center Party of Germany said at the time of the cease-fire treaty that "the German race will suffer but will not die
 " swabhaavik rup se germany ne is apmanjanak sharton ko dhone kaa safal prayaas kiya
 As a result, within a few years the political atmosphere of Europe became very turbulent and the world had to witness a fierce and catastrophic war even more than the First World War
 france ke marshall foch ke anusaar bhi "yah sandhi shanti nahin he, keval 20 varshon kaa yudhviram he
 "it is clear that the seeds of World War II existed in this treaty
 1919 main sandhi ke samay germany asahaay tha or sandhi ke chupchaap sweekaar karne ke alaava uske paas koi chaara na tha lekin jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya vaise-vaise vah kuch shakti sanchay karke sandhi kii sharton kaa ulanghan karne laga or sandhi nirmaataaon ne bhi usamen sanshodhan kiye
 The first part of the treaty was amended in 1926 when Germany was granted membership of the League of Nations
 yuddh aparaadhiyon sambandhi saatvaan bhaag kabhi purnatah kriyanvit nahin kiya gaya
 Many of the war criminals, including the German Emperor William Kaiser, were punished and only a few were given general punishment
 kshatipurti se sambandhit praavdhaan ko pehle to sanshodhit kiya gaya or baad main purnatah tyaag diya gaya
 The question of indemnification at the Lojan Conference was abolished
 1933-34 main german raajnneeti main hitler ke utkarsh ke baad varsay kii sharton ko todna to ek maamuli baat ho gai
 In 1935–36, Hitler violated the provisions relating to disarmament of the treaty and increased armies and in 1936 took control of Rheinland
 march 1938 main austria ko germany ke saath milakar tathaa sitambar 1938 checkoslovakia ko milakar hitler ne varsay kii sandhi ke pradeshik vyavasthaaon ke praavdhaanon ko bhang kar diya
 World War II started when Hitler invaded Poland with the aim of breaking the Polish Corridor and Danzing Port-related arrangements made by Poland under the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch milakar varsay sandhi kii anyaaypurna vyavasthaaon ko todane ke liye hi hitler ne ghatnaon kii vah shrunkhlaa aarambh kii jiske kaaran dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa visphot hua
 In this way, the final culmination of the process of elimination of the Treaty provisions of Versailles occurred at the beginning of the Second World War
 is drushti se dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej varsay kii sandhi main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Some critics believe that the World War II was not the harsh condition of the Versailles treaty, but the laxity in implementing them
 logsam ke anusaar- Thus there is no doubt that the unjustly harsh and degrading treaty of Versailles was to a extent liable to World War II
 kintu yah bhi satya he ki mitra rashtron kii paraspar virdohi niti, upeksha, udaseenta, tushtikaran or sandhi kii sharton ko kathortapurvak lagu na karwaane kii niti bhi iske liye kam uttaradaayi nahin thi

0214 Sarnath is a major Buddhist pilgrimage center located 10 km northeast of Kashi or Varanasi
 gyaan prapti ke pashchaat bhagwaan buddha ne apana pratham upadesh yaheen diya tha jise "dharm chakra pravartan" kaa naam diya jaataa he or jo buddha mat ke prachaar-prasar kaa aarambh tha
 This place is one of the four major pilgrimages of Buddhism
 iske saath hi sarnath ko jain dharm evam hindu dharm main bhi mahatv praapt he
 In Jain texts it is called 'sinhapur' and it is believed that Shreyansanath, the eleventh Tirthankara of Jainism, was born a little away from here
 yahaan par saaranganath mahadev kaa mandir bhi he jahaan sawan ke maheene main hinduon kaa mela lagata he
 Ashoka's Chaturmukha Simhastambha in Sarnath, Lord Buddha's Temple, Dhamekh Stupa, Chowkhandi Stupa, State Museum, Jain Temple, Chinese Temple, Moolangadhakuti and Naveen Vihar etc
 are worth visiting

 Muhammad Ghori destroyed the places of worship of Sarnath
 san 1905 main puraatatv vibhaag ne yahaan khudaai kaa kaam prarambh kiya
 At the same time, the attention of the followers of Buddhism and scholars of history got here

 Earlier there was dense forest and used to do antelope
 us samay iskaa naam 'rishipattan' or 'mrigadaay' tha
 After attaining enlightenment, Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon here

 The emblem of India with the idol of lions is taken from the top of the Ashoka pillar of Sarnath
 yahan kaa 'dhamek stupa' sarnath kii pracheenta kaa aaj bhi bodh karaata he
 Later, due to foreign invasions and mutual religious tussle, the importance of Sarnath was reduced
 mrigadaay main saaranganath mahadev kii murti kii sthapana hui or sthaan kaa naam sarnath pad gaya
 Its ancient name was Rishipatana
 rishipatan se taatpary ‘rishi kaa patan’ se he jiskaa aashay he vah sthaan jahaan kisi ek buddha ne gautam buddha bhavi sambodhi ko jaanakar nirvana praapt kiya tha
 It was named Mrigdava, based on the location of the deer, which is also mentioned in Nigrodhamrija Jataka
 aadhunik naam ‘sarnath’ kii utpatti ‘saaranganath’ arthath gautam buddha se hui
 Which is also related to a story of the Bodhisattva
 vodhisattva ne apane kisi purvajanm main, jab ve mrigadaav main mrigon ke raja the, apane praanon kii bali dekar ek garbhvatee harini kii jaan bachaai thi
 That is why this forest started to be called sarang-nath or saar-nath
 dayaram saahani ke anusaar shiv ko bhi puranic sahitya main saaranganath kaha gaya he or mahadev shiv kii nagari kaashi kii sameeptha ke kaaran yah sthaan shivopasana kii bhi sthali ban gaya
 This fact is confirmed by the presence of a Siva temple called Sarnath in Sarnath
 buddha ke pratham upadesh se 300 varsh baad tak kaa sarnath kaa itihaas agyaat he: kyonki utkhanan se is kaal kaa koi bhi avshesh nahin praapt hua he
 The prosperity of Sarnath and the development of Buddhism are first seen in the reign of Ashoka

 During the reign of Ashoka's successors, Sarnath again began to move towards decadence

 With the establishment of the Kushan State of North India around the first century AD, Buddhism once again flourished

 During his reign, Kanishka built many viharas and stupas not only in Sarnath but in different parts of India
 ek sthaneey kinvadanti ke anusaar buddha dharm ke prachaar ke purv sarnath shivopasana kaa centre tha
 But, as evidenced by the history of many places like Gaya etc
, it can also be vomited, that is, the worship of Shiva became prevalent here only after the fall of Buddhism
 jaan padataa he ki jaise kai pracheen vishaal nagaron ke upnagar yaa nagarodyan the usee prakaar sarnath main mulat: rishiyon yaa tapasviyon ke ashram sthit the jo unhone kaashi ke kolahal se bachane ke liye, kintu phir bhi mahaan nagari ke saannnidhya main, rahane ke liye banaae the

 This is also confirmed by an inscription obtained from excavation

 Historical information about the reference to Sarnath came to archaeologists at the time when Diwan Jagat Singh of Kashinresh Chet Singh dug up Dharmarajika Stupa ignorantly

 The first limited excavation of this area was done by Colonel Kaikenji in 1815 AD but he did not get any significant success

 In 1835–36, 20 years after the excavation of Kaikenji, Cunningham conducted a detailed excavation of Sarnath
 utkhanan main unhone mukhya rup se dhamekh stupa, chaukhandi stupa evam madhyakaalin viharon ko khod nikaala
 a recorded inscription of 600 AD was found 3 feet below the Dhamakh Stupa of Cunningham

 The Chinese traveler Xuan Tsang, who visited India in the seventh century, described it as the 200-foot-tall Moolgandh Kuti Vihar
 is mandir par bane hue naqkashidaar gole or natodar dhalaai, chote-chote stambhon tathaa sudanr kalapurna kataavon aadi se yah nishchit ho jaataa he ki iskaa nirmaan guptkaal main hua tha
 But some scholars believe it to be around the 8th century, based on paved floors made of mud and lime around it and the chaotic carved stones used on the exterior of the walls
 aisa prathit hota he ki is mandir ke bich main bane mandap ke neeche prarambh main bhagwaan buddha kii ek sone kii chamakili adamkad murti sthapit thi
 There was one gate in each of the three directions and the main entrance in the east direction for entering the temple

 This Vedika was initially around the Harnika above the Dharmarajika Stupa
 is vedika par kushaankalin brahmi lipi main do lekh ankit hai- ‘achaiana sarvastivaadi naan parigrahetavam’ or ‘aacharyanaa sarvastivadinaan parigrahe’
 It is known from both these writings that in the third century AD this vedika was presented to the masters of the Sarvastivist sect

 While digging in the foundation, it was discovered that it was installed on a large stone platform 8 feet X16 feet X18 inches
 is stambh par teen lekh ullikhit hai
 The first article is in the Ashoka Kalin Brahmi script in which the emperor has ordered that the beggars or nuns break into the sangha and condemn the sangha: they will be expelled from the sangha wearing white clothes
 doosraa lekh kushaan-kaal kaa he
 The third article is of Gupta period, in which the Acharyas of Sammitiya branch are mentioned

 The foundation of this stupa was laid during the time of Ashoka
 iskaa vistaar kushaan-kaal main hua, lekin guptkaal main yah purnat: taiyaar hua
 This evidence is confirmed by the decoration of the stones and the inscriptions inscribed on them in secret script
 kaningham ne sarvapratham is stupa ke madhya khudaai karakar 0
91 meter neeche ek shilapatt praapt kiya tha
 The platform 'ye Dharmhetu Prabhava' was written in the seventh century script on this shilapat

 kintu 11 veen shatabdi kii ek mudra par ‘dhamak jayatu’ shabd miltaa he
 It seems doubtful to relate its origin to the word written above

 People saw it with great respect and worshiped it
 kaningham ne ‘dhamekh’ shabd ko sanskrit shabd ‘dharmopadeshak’ kaa sankshipt rup sweekaar kiya he
 It is noteworthy that Buddha first started 'dharmachakra' here

 kautilya ke arthshaastra main yuddh or uske sanchaalan ke sambandh main jitna vyapak varnan kiya gaya he vah swayan is tathy ko siddh karata he
 The tradition of war has been going on since time immemorial
 maanav jati kaa itihaas yuddh ke adhyayan ke bina adhuraa he or yuddh kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitani maanav jati kii kahani
 Wars are one of the major reasons for the development of human civilization

 It is not easy to tie any subject to the definition of the test
 sainya vigyaan ke vyapak kshetra evam antarvishayi hone ke kaaran koi nishchit paribhaasha nahin di gai he
 Nevertheless some of the mystics have the following definition related to military science- captain bi

 The area of any subject is realized by its definition
 sainya vigyaan main yuddh or sena sambandhi samast baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 With the change of time and age, changes in the processes of warfare are going on, along with this the changes in the military organization, its training and weapons also went on, in the same way the field of military science also changed
 aadhunik samay main vaigyanik pragati or avishkaron ne yuddh ke kshetra ko or vistrut va vyapak kar diya he
 Science refers to the study of any subject according to the rules, in this view, if the subject of military science is tightened to the test of science, it will be completely fulfilled, because under it the organization of the army, weapons, warfare plan, management and support etc
 The study is done
 jis prakaar vigyaan ke kuch siddhanth evam niyam hote hai or unheen ke aadhaar par kaarywahi kii jaay to uddeshy kii prapti usee niyam ke anurup ho jaati he
 Similarly, under military science, there are many principles of war, which, by following them, makes the objective attainable
 athwa vigyaan un vishyon ko kehete hai jinke niyamon ke satyata kii jaanch prayogshaalaon main kii ja sake or jo niyam shaashvat or satya hon tathaa kala un vishyon ko kehete hai jinke niyamon kii satyata ko nischitata kii kasuti par nahin ksaa ja saktaa
 Science gives us knowledge about an object and art teaches us to do that work

 It is written in Makers of Modern Strategy that there will be no science of war
 yuddh kaa anek prakaar ke vigyaanon se sambandh he, parantu yuddh kaa apana koi vigyaan nahin he
 This is practical art and skill
 is sandarbh me prasiddh sainya visheshgy clajavitz kaa yah kathan ullekhneey he On the basis of both sides, it can be said that military science comes under both science and art, but experience seems to be a more powerful side of study
 sainyavigyaan gyaan kii ek shakha hone ke kaaran uskaa anya shakhaon se sambandh hona swaabhaavik env anivaary he
 The geographical conditions have a direct impact on military plans, weapons, operations, furnishings and tactical moves
 yahi kaaran he ki prayek raashtra ko apni bhugolic paristhitiyon ke anurup hi suraksha vyavastha apnaani padati he
 In this context, the famous British General Wavell says that the geography of a place ensures the nature of the battles taking place there
 bhugolic tathyon kii upeksha kar koi bhi sena yuddh main vijay praapt nahin kar sakati
 History gives us all information related to the culture and civilization of mankind, in the absence of which the study of wars is incomplete
 vigat yudhon ke jai-paraajay kaa vishleshan hi vartmaan evam bhavishya ke yudhon kaa aadhaar hota he

 Suntju has written that war is an essential part of the state and Shuman also says that war is the ultimate weapon of state power
 is sandarbh me prasiddh german sainya visheshgy clajavitz kaa yah kathan ullekhneey he ki rajya apni nitiyon ko kriyanvit karne ke liye yuddh kaa sahaara letaa he

 sena ek prakaar kaa saamaajik sanghathan hota he jisamen anushaasan, manobal, netritv, saahas, bhay, prachaar, deshbhakti kii bhaavana, chintaa, manograstata jaise maansik tatwon kaa bahut mahatv he
 Today's wars are psychological wars in which the mental mentality of the enemy has to be disintegrated before the actual battle
 hitler kaa kathan sainya vigyaan evam manovigyaan ke gahare sambandh ko darshata he ki vaastavik ladaai ek goli chalane ke pehle hi ladaa jaataa he
 In this regard, Kautilya has said, "the arrow left by the bow of a bowman is not possible to kill any soldier, but the use of intelligence by a wise person also destroys the creatures in the womb
" vigyaan evam takanic kaa prabhaav yadi jivan ke kisi ek kshetra main sabase zyada padataa he to vah he sainya kshetra
 More than fifty percent of the discoveries in the development of human civilization have been the objective of military necessity

 Toxic chemicals have been used since ancient times to achieve success in war

 Many types of toxic chemicals are used in modern warfare such as smoke spreaders, asphyxia, eye irritants, skin burners
 jiske kaaran hi rasaynic yudhkala kaa janm hua he
 By biological factors, every possible attempt is made to poison the enemy's food, water and food by weakening his health and disrupting his mental strength to fight
 vibhinn prakaar ke bimariyon ke jeevanuon ko vibhinn sadhano se shatru tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Disease caused by toxic bacteria not only affects the soldiers but also due to its equal impact on civilians, the enemy's morale falls, which adversely affects his military strength
 uparokt varnit vishyon ke alaava anya vishay jaise computer vigyaan, saamaajik vigyaan ityadi se bhi sainya vigyaan kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 Ancient wars were limited, which only concerned armies and generals, the general public had no special interest in wars
 jaise-jaise sabhyataa kaa vikaas hota gaya yudhon ke swaroopon main bhi parivartan aayaa or aaj yuddh sampoorn yuddh kaa swaroop dhaaran kar chukaa he
 Modern war is the test of the entire nation

 gauratlab he ki dephence studies, waar studies, military science or stritegic studies naam se raksha maamalon kii padhai bharat main hoti he
 The importance of this subject can be gauged from the fact that defense studies in many major countries of the world take place at school, college and university levels
 isse sambandhit course karne ke baad naukari ke liye tamaam vikalp saamne aa rahe hai
 Defense and Strategic Studies are also known as Military / Defense Studies, Military Science, War and National Security Studies, War and Strategic Studies
 iske mahatv ko dekhakar purv pradhan mantri dow manmohan singh ne 23 may 2013 ko binola, gudgaanv, haryana main bhartiya rashtriya raksha vishvidhyalay kii aadharshila rakhi
 The proposed Indian National Defense University will be located on more than 200 acres of land

 Problems such as Naxalism, terrorism, extremism, linguism, communalism, territorialism, peoples-revolt, cannot be solved through military means, nor are all these problems going to end nor peace and security can be established
 iske liye jaruri he ek vishwaas kaa vaataavaran paidaa karne kii
 Going to the bottom of the above problems will be done by finding logical and practical solutions to the root causes
 sainya vigyaan aantarik va bahya suraksha samasyaon ke kaaran, prabhaav evam upaay par vistrut prakaash daalata he
 In whose present context, there is an urgent need for study
 prasiddh sainya vichaarak lidile heart ne kaha he ki- yadi shaanti chaahate ho to yuddh ko samajho
 To prevent war in the world, it is most important to think deeply, contemplate and discuss the cause, effects and consequences of war
 is vishay ke adhyayan se vishwa vinaash ko rokane main bhi sakriy sahyog miltaa he
 Today the world has so many deadly and destructive weapons that the entire earth can be destroyed thousands of times
 aadhunik yuddh sampoorn yuddh hote hai evam jisamen apramparaagat yuddh style ke astr-shastron kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he tathaa yuddh ke kendra sainya evam naagarik thikaane donon ho sakate he
 It is not possible for soldiers who are fighting in the battlefield to help such a large population everywhere
 atah naagarik suraksha ke upayon kii vistrut jaankaree sainya vigyaan ke madhyam se liya ja saktaa he
 It is a very difficult task for any state to meet the financial requirements of war
 isliye sarkaar yudhkaal main daan yaa chande, rin jaisi sahaayta janata se leti he
 Military science sheds full light on the war and can provide the student with a deep understanding of it and make them responsible citizens
 sainya vigyaan ke dwaara desh ke prati hamaare kya karttavya hai tathaa samaaj main rahakar mathrubhumi kii raksha kis prakaar kerani chahie tathaa swayan ko ek adarsh sainik ke rup main prastut karne kaa avasar praapt karte hai
 Today's student can understand the issues of security interest deeply by becoming responsible citizen or soldier of tomorrow
 is kshetra main kariyar kii dher sari sambhaavnaaen hai
 It gives you information about the global affairs relationship from one country to another
 is field main course karne ke baad aap soshiyo-iconomic specialist, international field main research ban sakate hai
 With this, you can become Indian Army Officer, Indian Defense Officer, Ground Duty Officer, Research Officer, Military Officer in Indian Navy, Air Force, Defense Journalism
 dephence and stratsic studies main bachalers yaa masters degree lene vaale ummidavaar lekturer, college ke praadhyaapak, vishvavidhyalay main professor kaa job kar sakate hai yaa antarrashtriya sambandh, yuddh ke bhugarbha sambandhi maamalon, bhu raajnneetik maamalon, saamaajik-aarthik va samrik kshetron main research kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, employment opportunities mainly exist in the Indian Army, Air Force, Navy, Education Corporations, Defense Journalism
 agar aapane is field main master degree hasil kar lee to newspaper, magazine aadi main rashtriya suraksha ko lekar aalekh likh sakate hai
 The method and process of conducting war has now become the main topic of politicians, because the control and use of the largest weapon, that is, nuclear weapons, is in the hands of the politicians and not the generals
 sainya vigyaan kaa vidhyaarthee ko sainik maamalon main purv se paryaapt gyaan hone ke kaaran ek kushal netritv kshamta kaa parichay de saktaa he
 Because the biggest irony today is the lack of understanding of military knowledge by politicians
 raksha anusandhan or vishleshan, raksha niti banane, tactical services, rashtriya suraksha yojana evam kriyanvayan or civil dephence, pratiyogi parikshaon ke liye, sashastr sena, rashtriya suraksha sanghathan, raksha patrakarita, academik research, rajanyik, videsh niti banane, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar, niti banane sochane vaale tinkon main shaamil hona, suraksha pradaata agenciyaan, college va uniwarsity main shikshan, sarkaar or ujisi ke liye pustak lekhan va prakaashan

 kintu kharvel ko isa purv pehali shatabdi ke uttarardh main rakhanevaale vidwaanon kii sankhya bad raheen he
 After the decline of the Mauryan Empire, the Chedi dynasty emerged in Kalinga
 anumaan kiya jaataa he ki chedi vansh bundelkhand ke chedi vansh kii hi koi upashakha thi jo kaling main sthapit ho gai thi
 Kharavela was the third king of this dynasty and is called 'kalinga Chakravarti'
 udaygiri main hathigupha ke upar ek abhilekh he jisamen isaki prashasti ankit he
 According to that commendation it was a follower of Jainism

 kharvel, chedi vansh or kaling ke itihaas ke hi nahin, puure pracheen bhartiya itihaas ke pramukh shaskaon main se he
 What remains after the possibility of exaggeration in the account of Hathigumpha's record is clear that Kharavel was a commander of extraordinary merit and made a reputation like that of Kalinga not possible for many centuries later
 15 varsh kii aayu tak kharvel ne rajochit vidyaayein sikhin
 He became crown prince in the 16th year

 He first increased the length of a canal built by Nandraj
 use swayan sangeet main abhiruchi thi or janata ke manoranjan ke liye vah nrity or sagit ke samarohon kaa bhi aayojan karata tha
 Kharavel was also interested in building
 usne ek bhavy 'mahavijay-prasaad' naamak rajbhavan bhi banwaaya tha
 We do not know for sure about the Chedi dynasty after Kharavel
 sambhavat: uske uttaradhikari uske rajya ko sthir rakhane main bhi ayogy the jisase sheeghra hi samrajya kaa ant ho gaya
 According to the records of Hathigumpha, Kharavela was a descendant of Mahameghavahana
 kintu isamen yah nahin likhaa he ki kharvel or mahameghavaahan main kya sambandh tha athwa un donon ke bich main kul kitne raja hue

 There is a biography composed by Pawar for which he was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Marathi Language in 2007
 "ameniak" yahaan rediarect karata he
 For the Radiohead album, see Amnesiac
 2015 kii film ke liye, emnesia dekhen
 For other uses, see Amnesia
 mastishk kshati, beemaari, yaa manovaigyanik aghat ke kaaran smriti main amnesia ghaataa he
 Amnesia can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs
 hone vaali kshati kii seemaa ke kaaran smriti puri tarah se yaa aanshik rup se kho sakati he
 There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia
 retrogred amenesia kisi vishesh taarikh se pehle adhigrahit kii gai jaankaree ko punarprapt karne main asamarthta he, aamtaur par durghatana yaa sanchaalan kii taarikh
 In some cases memory loss may extend for decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory
 antrogred amenesia alpakaalik store se lambii avadhi kii dukaan main nai jaankaree sthanantarit karne main asamarthta he
 People with this type of amnesia may not remember things for long
 ye do prakaar parsparik rup se anany nahin hai; donon ek saath ho saktaa he
 Case studies also show that minesia generally damages the medial temporal lobe
 iske alaava, hippocampus ke vishisht kshetra smriti ke saath shaamil hai
 Research has also shown that when areas of dynesaflon are damaged, labyrinths can occur
 haal ke adhyayanon ne arabiapi 48 protein or memory los kii kami ke bich ek sahasambandh dikhaaya he
 Scientists were able to detect that mice with damaged memory have lower levels of rbap48 protein than normal, healthy mice
 amliya se peedit logon main, tatkaal jaankaree ko yaad karne kii kshamta abhi bhi barkaraar he, or ve abhi bhi nai yaaden banane main sakasham ho sakate hai
 However, a serious decrease in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be seen
 marijon ko nae prakriyaatmak gyaan sikh sakate hai
 In addition, priming can assist Emirates in the learning of fresh non-declarative knowledge
 purv shikshan episod main saamne aane vaali vishisht jaankaree ko yaad karne kii kshamta main gahan haani ke baavjood amenic rogiyon ne bhi bauddhik, bhashaai or saamaajik kaushal ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 The word is from the Greek, meaning 'to forget'; From ἀ-, meaning ‘without’, and μνήσις, meaning ‘memory’
 nai yaadon kaa adhigrahan Patients with amnesia can learn new information, especially non-declarative knowledge
 haalanki, ghaney antrogred amenesia vaale kuch rogiyon ko episod yaad nahin he, jiske dauraan unhone pehle soochna ko siikhaa yaa dekha
 declarative knowledge antrogred emnesia vaale kuch rogi abhi bhi kuch arthpurna jaankaree praapt kar sakate hai, bhale hi yah adhik kathin ho or shaayad adhik saamaanya gyaan se asambandhit rahe
 Hm One could accurately draw a floor plan of the house in which he lived after surgery, even though he had not lived there in years
 kaaran rogi nai episodic yaaden nahin bana sakate hai kyonki hippocampus kaa sie 1 kshetra ghaav tha, or is prakaar hippocampus cortex se conection nahin bana sakaa
 Following an ischemic episode after surgery, an MRI of patient RB left his hippocampus intact, leaving a specific lesion restricted to CH1 pyramidal cells
 gaiyr-ghoshnaatmak jaankaree Some retrograde and anterograde amnesics are capable of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch rogi swasth logon ke rup main chhadam yadrichhik anukram prayog main sudhaar dikhaate hai
 Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory
 ebbemarai adhyayanon ke mutabik, prakriyaatmak yaadon kaa adhigrahan basal gangliya, premotor cortex or poorak motor kshetra, kshetron ko sakriy karata he jo aam taur par ghoshnaatmak yaadon ke gathan se jude nahin hote hai
 This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with Korschoff syndrome, such as diencephalic amnesia
 kuch rogiyon dwaara pradarshit ek or udhaaharan, jaise ki ke
si
 or echem, jinke paas madhyakaalin asthaayee kshati or antrogred amenesia he, abhi bhi avadharanatmak priming he
 Those patients performed well in the term fragment completion test
 teen samanyikrut shreniyan hai jinamein ek vyakti dwaara bhulbhulaiya praapt kii ja sakati he
 The three categories are head trauma, traumatic events, or physical insufficiency
