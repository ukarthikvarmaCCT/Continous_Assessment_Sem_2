 Kamala itself is not a disease, but a symptom found in many diseases
 yah lakshan nanhen-nanhen bacchon se lekar 80 saal tak ke buudhon main utpann ho saktaa he
 If any defect occurs in any of the various metabolic processes of bile, then there is an excess of bile, which is caused by Kamala

 This bile, mixed with a protein, is transmitted in blood
 isko apratyaksh pittaranjak kehete hai
 Normally healthy molecules of the liver take this indirect bile, and add glucuronic acid to it, which passes through the liver cells and goes to the small intestines as a direct bile by the bile
 aanton main yah pittaranjak eurobilinogen main parivartit hota he jiskaa kuch ansh shoshit hokar raktaras ke saath jaataa he or kuch bhaag, jo vishtha ko apana bhura rang pradaan karata he, vishtha ke saath sharir se nikal jaataa he

 us samay rogi shithil, ardhvikshipt or kabhi-kabhi purna veikshipt ho jaataa he tathaa mar bhi jaataa he
 The cause of the disease is ascertained before the treatment of Kamala
 iske liye rakt kii jaanch, paakhaane kii jaanch tathaa yakrut-kii kaaryashakti kii jaanch karte hai
 This suggests that it is due to excess destruction of red particles in the blood, or liver cells are unhealthy or due to obstruction of the gallbladder

 viral hepatitis e tathaa naae va naan bi ek vyakti se duusare vyakti ke najdiki sampark se hota he
 These viruses occur in the feces of the patient, it is spread by the feces of the person suffering from jaundice, contaminated water, milk or food
 aisa ho saktaa he ki kuch rogiyon kii aankh, nakhun yaa sharir aadi pile nahi dikh rahe hon parantu yadi ve is rog se grast ho to anya rogiyo kii tarah hi rog ko failaa sakate hai
 Viral hepatitis b is spread by the exchange and sexual activity of blood and blood and blood produced substances
 isamen vah vyakti ho detaa he use bhi rogi bana detaa he
 Here the person giving blood becomes a disease carrier
 bina ubali sui or sirange se injection lagane par bhi yah rog fail saktaa he
 Individuals with jaundice virus reach the human body directly with fingers and indirectly from the patient's feces or by flies

 Hemoglobin is fed bacteria by macrophages and is divided into its heme and globin parts
 globin vaala bhaag, jo ek protein hota he, amino amlon main avakramit hota he or pilia main isaki koi bhoomika nahin hoti he
 Then there are two reactions with the heme molecule
 pratham oxikaran pratikriya laghunetraguha sambandhi anzime heme oxijinez ke dwaara utprerit hoti he or iske parinamswaroop beliverdin, loha or carbon monooxide utpann hote hai
 The next step is the reduction of biliverdin to a yellow-colored tetrapyrrole pigment bilirubin by the cytoplasm enzyme biliverdine reductase
 This bilirubin is "unconjugated," "free" or "indirect" bilirubin
 pratidin prati kilogram lagbhag 4 milligram billirubin utpann hota he
 Most of these bilirubin comes from the process just described by the breakdown of hemi from dead red blood cells
 haalanki lagbhag 20 pratishat anya hemi sroton se aata he, jisamen aprabhavi laal rakt koshikaon kii utpatti or anya heme yukt protein, jaise ki manshapeshi sambandhit miloglobin or cytochrome kaa tootna shaamil he
 The unconjugated bilirubin then travels to the liver via the bloodstream
 kyonki yah billirubin ghulansheel nahin hota he, tathaapi, yah rakt ke madhyam se serum annsaar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Once reaching the liver, it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to become more soluble in water
 This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme udp-glucuronide transferase
 yah sanyugmit billirubin yakrut se sravit hokar pitt ke hisse ke rup main pittanli or mutrashayik naaliyon main pahunchataa he
 The intestinal bacterium converts bilirubin into urobilinogen
 yahan se eurobilinosen do maarg apana saktaa he
 It can either be then converted to stercobilinozene, which is then oxidized to stercobilin and released into the stool or it can be reabsorbed by intestinal cells, transported into the kidneys into the blood
 And the oxidized product is released into the urine in the form of urobilin
 stercobilin or eurobilin utpaada kramshah mel or mutr ke rang ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 When a pathological process interferes with the normal function of metabolism and excretion of bilirubin is reported correctly, it can result in jaundice
 rogaatmak kriya dwaara prabhavit hone vaale shaareerik tantra ke angon ke aadhaar par pilia ko teen shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he
 There are three categories: yakrut main pehle hone vaala pilia kisi bhi aise kaaran se hota he jo rakt-apghaton ke dar main vruddhi karata he
 In tropical countries, malaria can cause jaundice in this manner
 kuch anuvanshik bimaariyaan jaise ki hansiya ke aakaar kii rakt koshika main hone vaali raktaheenata, golckoshikta or glucose 6-phosphate dihydrogenej kii kami koshika apghaton main vruddhi utpann kar sakati he or isliye rudhirlayi pilia ho saktaa he
 Typically, kidney diseases, such as hemolytic uremiogenic syndrome, can also lead to pigmentation
 billirubin ke chayapachay main vikaar hone se bhi pilia ho saktaa he
 Jaundice usually comes with high temperature fever
 chuuhe ke kaatane se hone vaale bukhaar se bhi pilia ho saktaa he
 Laboratory findings include: yakrut main hone vaala pilia gambhir yakritshoth, yakrut kii vishaaktata or alcohol sambandhi yakrut rog kaa kaaran banataa he, jiske dwaara koshika parigalan yakrut ke chayapachay karne kii kshamta or rakt kaa nirmaan karne ke liye billirubin utsarjit karne kii kshamta kam karata he
 Less common causes include primary gall bladder disease, Gilbert's syndrome, kriegler-najjar syndrome, metastatic cancer, and nyman-pick's disease, class C
 Jaundice found in a newborn baby, called neonatal jaundice, usually usually each Occurs in the newborn because hepatic mechanisms for the coincidence and excretion of bilirubin are not fully mature before about two weeks of age It happens
 prayogshaala ke nishkarshon main shaamil hai: Out-of-liver jaundice, also known as obstructive jaundice, is caused by obstructions in bile clearance in the biliary system
 sabase aam kaaran hai aam pitt nalee main pitt pathari kaa hona or agnyashay ke sheersh par agnashyi cancer hona
 iske alaava, parjiviyon kaa ek samooh, jinhen "yakrut paraseete" kaha jaataa he aam pitt nalee main rah sakate hai, jo pratirodhatmak pilia utpann kar sakate hai
 Other causes include blockage of the common bile duct, biliary atresia, ductal carcinoma, pancreatitis, and pancreatic larynx
 pratirodhatmak pilia kaa ek asaadhaaran kaaran mirizzi sanglakshan he
 The presence of yellow stools and dark urine indicates a resistant or out-of-liver cause as normal stools receive color from bile pigment
 rogiyon main kabhi-kabhi atyadhik serum cholestrol upasthit rah saktaa he or ve aksar gambhir khujali yaa "khaaj" kii shikaayat karte hai
 No one can distinguish between different classifications of investigational jaundice
 yakrut ke kaary pareekshanon kaa mishran ek nidaan par pahunchane ke liye aavashyak he
 Neonatal jaundice is usually harmless: this condition is often seen in newborns, about the second day after birth
 yah avasthaa saamaanya prasavon main 8wein din tak rahati he, yaa samay se pehle janm hone par 14wein din tak rahati he
 Serum bilirubin goes to low levels without any necessary intervention: jaundice is likely the result of a metabolic and physiological adaptation after birth
 charam sthitiyon main, mastishk ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali sthiti mastiskinvjatkaamala utpann ho sakati he, jisase mahatvapurn aaajeevan aapangata ho sakati he
 There is concern that the condition has been increasing in recent years due to insufficient discovery and inadequate treatment of neonatal bilirubin overdose

 It was once believed that people suffering from jaundice saw everything yellow
 vistaar main jane par, piliagrast aankh kaa arth ek pakshpatpurna drushtikon samajha jane laga, jo saamaanya rup se adhik nakaaratmak yaa adhik doshagrahi tha
 Alexander Pope wrote in "an Essay on Criticism": "the infected detective seems to be infected by everyone, as the partisan view seems to be biased everywhere"
 Similarly in the mid-19th century the English poet Lord Alfred Tennyson wrote in his poem Locksley Hall: "so i triumphe'd ere my passion sweeping thro 'me left me dry, left me with the palsied heart, and left me with a jaundiced eye
 " piliagrast adhikansh rogiyon main yakrut falak asaamanyataon kii vibhinn purvanumaan yogya paddatiyaan hongi, yadhyapi isamen avashya hi mahatvapurn parivartan hota he
 Typical liver plaques will primarily include blood levels of liver-derived enzymes, such as aminotransferase and alkaline lupus; Bilirubin; And protein levels, specifically, total protein and volume
 Other major laboratory tests for liver function include GGT and prothrombin time
 haddi or hriday sambandhi kuch vikaar ALP or eminotransferez main vruddhi laa sakate hai
 Therefore, the first step towards differentiating them from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which will only increase in specific liver conditions
 The second step is to differentiate from biliary or hepatic causes of jaundice and altered laboratory tests
 pehla vishesh rup se ek shalya chikitsa sambandhi pratikriya suchit karata he, jabaki doosraa vishesh rup se chikitsiya pariksha kii pratikriya kaa sahaara letaa he
 ALP and GGT levels in particular will increase in one way while AST and ALT will increase in a different way
 If ALP and GGT levels rise in proportion to the height of AST and ALT, then this indicates the problem of gallbladder disease
 duusari taraf, agar AST or ALT main vruddhi ALP or GGT main vruddhi se mahatvapurn rup se adhik hota he, to yah ek yakrut sambandhi samasya ko suchit karata he
 Finally, comparing the levels of AST and ALT may be useful in distinguishing between hepatic causes of jaundice
 AST str aamtaur par ALT str se adhik hogi
 sivaay yakritshoth ke adhikansh yakrut sambandhi vikaron main yahi sthiti bani rahati he
 Alcohol can cause relatively normal ALT levels in liver damage, with AST being 10x higher than AST
 duusari taraf, yadi ALT AST kii tulana main adhik hota he, to yah yakritshoth kaa suchak hota he
 ALT and AST levels do not correlate well to the extent of liver damage, although very high levels of these levels may indicate severe necrosis at the earliest
 shviti ke nimna str ek dirghakaalik sthiti suchit karne lagate hai jabaki yah yakritshoth or pittaruddh kamla main saamaanya rup se hota he
 The results of laboratories for hepatic plaques are often compared to the magnitude of their differences, not the net number as well as their ratios
 The AST: ALT ratio can be a good indicator of whether the disorder is liver damage due to alcohol consumption, other types of liver damage, or hepatitis
 10x saamaanya se adhik billirubin ke str navtpadit yaa yakrut ke andar pittasthirataa suchit kar sakate hai
 This causes lower levels to indicate hepatocellular causes
 15x se adhik AST str teevr yakritkoshikeey nuksaan ko suchit karne lagata he
 This tends to indicate less resistant causes
 saamaanya 5x se adhik ALP str pratirodh ko suchit karne lagata he, jabaki saamaanya 10x se adhik str aushadhi prerit pittaruddh kamla yakritshoth yaa cytomegalovyrus ko suchit kar sakate hai
 ALT and AST can be higher than the normal 20 Ã in both of these conditions
 saamaanya 10x se adhik GGT str vishesh rup se pittasthirataa ko suchit karte hai
 5â10 Ã levels indicate viral hepatitis
 saamaanya 5Ã se kam str aushadhi vishaaktata ko suchit karne lagate hai
 In severe hepatitis, ALT and AST levels in particular will increase above the normal 20â30 Ã and may significantly increase significantly for several weeks
 asitominophen vishaaktata ke parinamswaroop ALT or AST str saamaanya 50x se adhik ho sakate hai

 Turkish languages are a language family of more than thirty-five languages
 turki bhashaayen purvi europe or bumadhya sagar se lekar saiberia or pashchimi china tak boli jaati hai
 Some linguists consider them a branch of the Altai language family
 vishwa main lagbhag 16
5 se 18 karod log turki bhashaayen apni maatrubhaasha ke rup main bolte hai or agar sabhi turki bhashaaon ko bol sakane waalon kii gananaa kii jaae to qareeb 25 karod log inhen bol sakate hai
 Turkish is also the name of the most spoken Turkish language, although sometimes it is also called Anatolvi
 turki bhashaaon main kuch visheshtaayen dekhi ja sakati hai - The Orkhon inscriptions located in the Orkhon Valley of Mongolia are the oldest writings found in any Turkish language and the language used in them is called Old Turkish language
 yah shilaayein 732 or 735 i ke bich ke kaal main kul tigin or bilge qaagaan naamak do gokaturk qabeele ke saradaaron ke sammaan main khadi kii gai thim
 The first deep study on Turkish languages was completed by Kashmiri Mahmud, a resident of the Karakhan Sultanate, in his 11th century book "divanue Lugitit Turk"
 yah turki boliyon kaa sab se pehla vistrut shabdkosh tha or isamen turki bhashaayen bolne waalon ke failaav kaa sab se pehla gyaat naqsha tha
 Turkish-speaking forces dominated the whole of Central Asia after the sixth century
 afghanistan or bhartiya upmahadweep ke uttari ilaaqon par bhi inkaa qabza ho gaya
 All the rulers of the Ghulam dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate and the first ruler of the Mughal Empire, Babur, were Turkish matriarchs
 babar dwaara likhit aitihaasik varnan babarnama bhi turki parivaar kii chagat i bhashaa main likhaa hua he
 With this effect, many Turkish words merged into Persian, hindi-urdu, Russian and Hungarian

 Note that the correct pronunciation of the letter 'b' used in this article and in Turkish languages is slightly different from 'b'
 isi tarah 'ga' varna kaa sahi uccharan 'ga' se bhinn hota he
 Soil is composed of coarse, medium and finely organic and inorganic mixed particles on the earth's upper surface
 upree sataha par se mitti hataane par praaia: chattan pai jaati he
 Sometimes the rock is found at a slight depth
 'mrudaa vigyaan' bhautik bhugol kii ek pramukh shakha he jisamen mrudaa ke nirmaan, uski visheshtaon evam dharaatal par uske vitaran kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa hai
 Only the particles on the top surface of the earth are called soil nadiyon ke kinare tathaa pani ke bahaav se laai gai mitti jisko 'kachaar mitti' kehete hai, khodne par chattan nahin milti
 There is a source of water in the lower level
 sabhi mittiyon kii utpatti chattan se hui he
 Where nature did not manipulate the soil and the climate did not have much effect, it is possible that we could establish a gradual relationship of the soil with the rocks below
 yadhyapi upar kii sataha kii mitti kaa rang-rup neeche kii chattan se bilkul bhinn he, phir bhi donon main rasinic sambandh rahata he or yadi prakritik kriya dwaara, arthath jal dwaara bahaakar, athwa vaayu dwaara udaakar, duusare sthal se mitti nahin laai gai he, tab yah sambandh purna rup se sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 a layer above the rock can also be found that is formed from the rock itself and has not yet come into full soil by natural action, only thick pieces of rock have been formed, which can neither be called soil
 Are and not rock
 inhen kii upree sataha main mitti kii banaavat pai jaati he
 In this level of soil, we can find the accumulation of chemical and physical properties of the rock below
 yadi chattan crystalia he, to isaki sambhaavna shat pratishat pakki he
 The very proximal, lateral part of the rock below may have similar chemical and physical properties as the rock
 jaise-jaise upar kii ore duuri badhati jaaegi chattan kii ruparekha bhi badalati jaaegi
 In the end, we find the soil, which has proved to be very favorable for agriculture and on which agriculture has been going on since the beginning and man has been producing crops
 koi-koi mitti duusari jagah kii chattaanon se banakar prakritik kaarnon se aa jaati he
 In such places it is unlikely that the physical and chemical relationship of the soil above is established by the accumulation of the bottom, but it is certain that the soil originated from rocks
 kheton kii mitti main chattaanon ke khanijon ke saath-saath, ped paudhon ke sadane se, carbonic padaarth bhi paae jate hai
 The microscopic and chemical analysis shows that the wear and tear of rocks is slowly due to the effects of chemical substances found in nature
 chattaanon ke rasinic avyav badal jate hai or mitti kii ruparekha bilkul bhinn prathit hoti he
 If weeding the rock was a major activity in the formation of soil, then today we do not find the soil of fields suitable for growing plants
 mitti kii tulana pisi hui baarik chattan se nahin kii ja sakati
 Although the minerals of the rocks are found very much in the upper part of the soil and their fragments are also present in large quantities, the animal continues to have animal activities, which have proved important for agriculture
 jeevajantu tathaa unase sambandh rakhanevaale padaartho ke, jaise ped paudhon kii sadi hui vastuon or sade hue jeev jantuon ke, prabhaav se kalil avasthaa main praapt chattaanon ke chote chote kanon par pratikriya hoti rahati he or mitti kaa rang rup badal jaataa he
 This form is not just the particles of rocks, the soil is equipped with a new system of earth
 ham sookshmdarshi se mitti ke ek tukade kii pariksha karen or phir usee yantra dwaara in chattaanon ke kanon kii pariksha karen to ham donon main jameen aasmaan kaa antar paavenge
 This difference is caused by a combination of inorganic materials that are obtained from animals and plants
 prakritik kriyaaon dwaara chattaanon kaa chote-chote kanon main parivartan hone se mitti ke banane main jo sahaayta hoti he, us kriya ko apkshay kehete hai
 This action is important and it is because of this that we find the soil on the earth favorable for agriculture
 is kriya main jal, hawa main sthit oxigen, carbon dioxide, jeevanuon tathaa anya amleey rasinic dravyon se bahut sahaayta milti he
 It is believed that the soil on which natural action takes place, the water falls and the air and sunlight are in contact, it takes a form in a few years to form a variety of different color and quality soils below it
 They become staves
 yadi ham mitti kii upree sataha par 10 yaa 12 foot gaharaa gaddha khoden or mitti ke parshv kaa avlokan karen, to hamen niyamit rup se kai bhinn rup rang, rachana kii mitti ek str se duusare str tak milti jaaegi
 Scientists have considered only three major levels of it and they have also described for what reasons and under what circumstances
 jal mitti ke upree sanstar par se hote hue or bahut se rasinic dravyon ko lete hue neeche ke sanstar main jaataa he or vahaan mitti ke saath milakar anek rasinic kriyaaon dwaara mitti ke rang rup ko badal detaa he
 In this way, the matter comes from the top and gets deposited in the bed below
 inamen ek he upree sanstar, jisamen se jal dwaara vilyan hokar dravya neeche kii ore jate hai, athwa avakshepan kriya dwaara neeche ke str main jamaa ho jate hai
 We call this upper bed
 doosraa vah sanstar he, jisamen upar varnan kii gai kriya dwaara dravya aakar jamaa hote hai ise sanstar kehete hai
 The third stratum is below it, in which the soil above it is formed, it is called stratum
 is sanstar ko duusare shabdon main paitruk sanstar bhi kaha jaataa he
 This name is meaningful because the soil above this bed has originated
 is sanstar main chattan or usase bane bade-bade malbe paae jate hai
 Each bed contains different levels
 sanstaron kaa krambaddh sambandh dikhalaanaa ati kathin samasya he
 This problem was first solved by Russian scientists
 sabase kathin samasya tab prakat hoti he jab mitti ke upree sanstar kaa kuch ansh apradan dwaara cat jaataa he
 Sometimes the entire bed is eroded and the bed remains
 in sanstaron ke aantarik sambandh par jis vigyaan ke kshetra main anusandhan hota he, use mrudavigyaan kehete hai
 This science helps in the classification of soil
 yah aadhunik vigyaan he or isaki uttarotar unnati hoti ja rahi he
 It has now been proved that agriculture cannot be benefited only by knowing the physical and chemical properties of the top surface of the soil
 paudhon kii badhati ko jaanane ke liye tathaa krishakon ko salaah dene ke liye yah aavashyak he ki mitti ke vibhinn sanstaron ke bhautik or rasinic gun tathaa inkaa paraspar sambandh jaan liya jaay
 There are different types of particles in the soil
 inamen jo ausatan nune maatra ke kan hai, ve hi mitti ko urvara banane ke liye aavashyak hai
 Due to these, the formation of soil-like structure is produced
 is rachana dwaara mitti main jal avasorana kii kriya bad jaati he tathaa paudhon ke liye anya vibhinn prakaar ke khaadya padaarth bhi avashoshit hote hai
 The physical properties of soil are dependent on soil composition, heat and mineral content of the soil
 mitti ke kan bhinn-bhinn aakaar prakaar ke, koi bade to koi chote or koi ati sookshm, hote hai
 Larger particles are fragments of small stones
 jaise jaise inpar prakritik kriyaayein hoti jaati hai, bade tukade chote hote jate hai or ant main baaluu, silt, chikani mitti athwa domat mitti ke aakaar ke ho jate hai
 Larger soil particles are found in most sandy soils and smaller sized particles are found in Matiyar soils
 inhen donon aakaar ke kanon ke mishran se bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii mittiyaan banati hai or unke bhinn-bhinn bhautik gun bhi hua karte hai
 The physical properties of the soil are very closely related to agricultural science
 mitti ke kuch bhautik gun, jaise aapekshik gurutv, kanvinyas, kan aakaar,, mitti kii sughatyata or sansanjan, rang, bhaar kanantarik chhidr, samooh aadi mahatv ke hai, mitti kaa aapekshik gurutv do prakaar kaa, ek abhaasi or doosraa nirpeksh hota he
 Virtual relative gravity is achieved by the inclusion of water and air in the inner part of the soil, that is, the gravity of water and air mixed with the mineral located inside the soil
 isaliye is gurutv kii maatra nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv se kam hoti he
 This is the ratio between the weight of dry soil with a known volume and the weight of water with the same volume
 yah 1
40 se 1
68 tak hota he
 The clay and silt particles are very small and light, so they do not condense with each other
 aisi mitti kaa bhaar kam hota he
 To know the weight of soil, loam and silt, it is made dry, because different types of soil have different types of moisture
 nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv mitti ke un bhaagon se sambandh rakhata he jo khanij tatv he
 Because of this its value is high
 nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv 1
4 se 2
6 ke bich main hota he
 Clay particles form clusters
 bhinn-bhinn samooh bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii mitti utpann karte hai
 These particles are mixed with each other in different ways and their interaction is firm and orderly
 kan kisi bhi rup or aakaar ke ho sakate hai
 Soil fertility is dependent on the configuration of the particles
 paudhon ko hawa or pani kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or hawa tathaa pani kaa mitti main rahanaa kanon ke vinyas par nirbhar he
 These particle groups are- ho sakate hai
 Particle size also has an effect on other physical properties of the soil
 bade aakaar ke kanonvali mitti ke kanantarik chhidr bade hote hai
 In such soil, water flows down with great intensity, due to which there is always a lack of moisture
 aisi mitti main sheeghra garam or thanda ho jane kaa gun rahata he tathaa aisi mitti oosar hoti he
 Small mottled soils, especially clay soils, have opposite properties
 mitti ke saath jal ke milane se The presence of organic matter also leads to soil solubility
 chote-chote kanon ke kaaran sughatyata badhati he
 Eitberg has stated four stages of solubility, which depend on the amount of water
 mitti ke vibhinn kanon par ek duusare se vidyut shakti dwaara khinchaav utpann hota he, jise sansanjan kehete hai
 Cogeneration and solubility are interrelated
 ek ke adhik hone se doosraa bhi adhik ho jaataa he

 louh ke oxikaran se yah rang praapt hota he
 The color of black soil is black due to the presence of organic matter and humus
 aisi mitti adhik varsha vaale sthanon main pai jaati he
 Most of the soil is made up of minerals
 aapekshik gurutv se bhaar kaa gyaan hota he
 The soil becomes light due to excess of organic matter and fossils
 mitti ke kanon ke bich kuch jagah chhuti rahati he
 These places are called particulate holes
 yah kanon ke vinyas par nirbhar karata he
 By this, the percentage of pores volume can be detected, but the shape and form of the holes is not known
 matiyaar mitti main kanantarik chhidr chote hote hai, jabaki balui mitti main ve bade hote hai
 This makes the soil soil absorb more water and the sand soil absorbs less
 pehle prakaar kii mitti keshikeey hoti he or duusare prakaar kii akeshikeey

 This results in more water stagnation and plowing is also more easily
 kanon ko maapkar unka vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 The measurements reveal a lot of soil properties and fertility
 yah vargeekaran antarrashtriya he: The measurement of these particles derives from a scientific equation called Stokes
 mitti main jal kaa bahut bada mahatv he
 This water is of four types: jab tak pani paryaapt rahata he, paudhe kii jad apana kaam karti rahati he
 Gradually, when the water gets depleted, then there is such a situation that the roots of the plant are unable to absorb water and the plants start drying up
 aisi avasthaa main mitti main jal bahut kam rahata he or usko mitti se preshit karne ke liye adhik maatra main shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In such a state, the water which is in the soil, it is called Mlaganigank
 isaki upyogita adhik he, kyoki isse mitti ke colloid padaarth kii maatra gyaat hoti he
 Apart from this, it also gives knowledge of the amount of inert water
 us adhiktam jal ko, jise mitti santrupt vayumandal ke kisi ek taap par avashoshit karti he, ardratagrahi gunank athwa ardrataavashoshi kshamta kehete hai
 Knowledge of hygienic coefficient is obtained as follows
 mitti main kanantarik chhidr rahete hai
 When there is no water in those holes, then air enters

 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn

 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation

 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height
 natural sellection kaa ek vishesh maamla yon chayan hota he, jo kisi bhi gun ke liye chayan hota he jo sambhog kii safalataa ko badhaata he or sambhavit mitron ke jeevon ke aakarshan ko badhaata he
 Characteristics developed through sexual selection are especially prominent among males of many animal species

 hepatitis bi virus ke sankraman kaa pataa lagane ke liye pareekshan, jise parakh kaha jaataa he main cerum yaa rakt pariksha shaamil hota he jo yaa to viral antigen yaa phir mejabaan ke dwaara utpaadit antibodies kii pahchaan karata he
 The interpretation of these tests is complex
 hepatitis bi sataha antigen kaa is sankraman kii upasthiti ke liye aksar baar-baar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is the first identifiable viral antigen that appears during infection
 haalanki, ek sankraman ke shuru main, yah antigen upasthit nahin bhi rah saktaa he or baad main yah anapahachaanaa bhi rah saktaa he kyonki yah mejabaan dwaara saaf kiya jaataa rahata he
 Infectious virions also have an inner "core particle" enclosing the viral genome
 isahedral kor kan 180 yaa 240 prati kor protein se bana hota he, jo vaikalpik rup se hepatitis bi kor antigen hbcag ke rup main gyaat he
 During the same 'window' in which hosts remain infected but successfully clear the vices, igm antibodies to hepatitis b core antigen may be the only serological evidence of the disease
 hbeag ke prakat hone ke turant baad hepatitis b e naamak ek or antigen prakat ho jayega
 paramparaagat rup se, mejabaan ke serum main hbeag kii upasthiti viral pratikruti ke adhik ucch daron se yukt hota he or prabhaavaheenata ko badha detaa he; tathaapi, hepatitis bi virus ke verient 'i' antigen kaa utpaadan nahin karte isliye yah niyam hameshaa sach nahin hota he
 During the natural course of infection, hbeag can be cleared and antibodies to the 'E' antigen are produced immediately after
 yah roopantaran aamtaur par viral pratikruti main naatakeey giravat ke saath judaa hai
 If the host is able to clear the infection, hbsag will eventually become undetectable and will then produce igg antibodies and core antigens from the hepatitis b surface
 The time period between the removal of hbsag and the appearance of anti-hbs is called the window period
 hbsag ke liye nakaaratmak evam anti-hbc ke liye sakaaratmak vyakti yaa to sankraman ko khatm kar chukaa hota he yaa use pehle se tikaa lagaaya gaya hota he
 Individuals who have been in hbsag positive for at least six months are considered as carriers of hepatitis B
 virus ke vaahakon ko chronic hepatitis bi ho saktaa he jo unnat serum elnin aminotranscourej str or liver ke sujan dwaara parilakshith hoga, jaisaa ki biopsy se pataa chalata he
 Carriers that are seroconverted in the event of a negative hbeag infection, especially those who have acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and thus have long-term complications or other infections
 The risk of transmitting is less
 pisiar pareekshan ko echbivi diene kii pahchaan or maap ke liye viksit kiya gaya he jise chikitsakeey namoonay main viral lod kaha jaataa he
 These tests are used to evaluate a person's infection status and to monitor treatment
 ucch viral lod vaale vyaktiyon ke paas, khaas andaaj main biopsy par ground glass hepatocites hota he
 Several vaccines have been developed by Maurice Hillman for the prevention of Hepatitis b virus infection
 ye viral invelp protein ke ek upyog par vishwaas karte he
 The vaccines are originally made from plasma obtained from patients with long-term hepatitis b virus infection
 haalanki, vartmaan main, yah ek synthetic riconbinent diene takanic kaa upyog kar ke banaaya jaataa he jisamen rakt utpaada nahin hote
 is tike se aap hepatitis bi ko nahin pakad sakate
 After vaccination, hepatitis b surface antigen can be found in the serum for several days, known as vaccine antigenemia
 tikaa ko vyask or shishuon main yaa to do-teen yaa chaar khuraaq anusoochiyon main iskaa bandobast kiya jaataa he jo vyaktiyon ko 85-90% kii suraksha pradaan karata he
 In individuals who show adequate early response to the initial course of vaccination, protection was monitored for 12 years and this immunity was predicted for at least the last 25 years
 hepatitis e ke vipareet hepatitis bi aam taur par bhojan or pani ke madhyam se nahin failata
 iske bajaay, yah sharir ke taral padaarth ke sancharan ke madhyam se failata he, isliye isaki rokthaam is prakaar ke sancharan kaa parihaar kar ke kiya jaataa he: asurakshit yon sampark, raktaadhan, sandooshit suiyon or sirinjon kaa dubaara prayog or bachche ke janm ke dauraan urdhwadhar sancharan

 Shi, et al have shown that combined lamivudine, efficacy and efficacy in hbv-carrying mothers with a high level of infectivity in small doses of hepatitis b immune globulin, or in the later days of pregnancy, despite combined immunoprophylaxis starting with WHO recommended new births
 HBV in a protective manner inhibits intrauterine transmission, a new addition to the prevention of HBV at the initial stage The Shti provided
 teevr hepatitis bi sankraman ke upachaar kii aamtaur par aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he kyonki zyaadaatar vayask anayas hi sankraman ko mukt kar dete hai
 Initial antiviral treatment may be required only by less than 1% of patients whose infection has a very aggressive course or who are immunocompromised
 duusari ore, chronic sankraman ke upachaar ke liye serosis or liver cancer ke jokhim ko kam karnaa aavashyak ho saktaa he
 Infected individuals with chronically dysregulated elevated alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, and HBV DNA levels are candidates for therapy
 haalanki uplabdh davaaiyon main koi bhi sankraman ko khatm nahin kar saktaa, ye virus ko pratikruti se roak sakate hai or liver kii kshati ko kam kar sakate hai
 Currently, seven medications of hepatitis b infection are licensed in the United States
 inamen antiveiral drugs lamivudin, adefovir, tenophovir, telbivudine, evam intecvir tathaa do pratiraksha pranali madulators interferon alpha 2a or pegilated anterferon alpha -2a shaamil hai
 The use of interferon, which needs to be injected daily or three days a week, is replaced by long-term active pegylated interferon, which is injected once a week
 haalanki, kuch vyakti dusron kii apeksha sambhavat: adhik pratikriya karte hai or yah sankraman karne vaale virus ke genotip yaa rogi kii anuvanshikta ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 Treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, reducing viral load
 hepatitis bi kii vaahak maataaon se turant janme shishuon kaa ilaaj hepatitis bi virus ke antibody se kiya ja saktaa he
 When the vaccine is given within twelve hours of birth, the risk of hepatitis acquisition is reduced by 90%
 yah ilaaj ek maan ko apane bachche ko surakshit stanpan karaane ke liye anumati detaa he
 In July 2005, researchers at a * STAR and National University of Singapore identified the linkage of a DNA protein and HBV replication in patients with a class of protein heterogenous nucleon ribonucleoprotein K
 Control of hnrnp k levels may serve as a possible cure for HBV
 ilaaj kaa prabhaav ginotips ke bich alag-alag hota he
 Interferon treatment can produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype a but only 6% seroconversion in type D
 Genotype b has seroconversion rates similar to Type A
 tip e or bi main nirantar i antigen nuksaan ilaaj ke baad ~ 45% he lekin tip si or di main keval 25-30% he
 Hepatitis b virus infections can be either acute or chronic
 Individuals with self-limiting infections spontaneously eliminate the infection within weeks to months
 vayaskon kii tulana main bacchon main sankraman ko khatm karne kii kam sambhaavna hoti he
 More than 95% of people who are infected as adults or aged children recover completely and develop immunity to the virus
 haalanki, 30% chote bacchon ke liye or keval 5% nae janmen shishu ke liye jo janm ke samay apni maataaon se sankraman adhigrahan karte hai, yah drop sankraman ko dur karegaa
 is aabaadi ko jivan paryant serosis yaa hepatocellular carcinoma se 40% maut kaa khatra he
 70% of those infected between the age of six will remove the infection
 hepatitis di keval sahavarti hepatitis bi sankraman se utpann ho sakate hai, kyonki HDV echbivi sataha antigen kaa upyog capcid nirmaan ke liye karata he
 Coagulation with hepatitis d increases the risk of cancer and liver cirrhosis
 polyarteritis nodosa hepatitis bi sankraman vaale logon main adhik saamaanya he
 Hepatitis b virus remains firm in the body after DNA infection and some people have recurrence of the disease
 haalanki durlabh, punarskriyan adhiktar aksar durbal pratiraksha se yukt rogiyon main dekha jaataa he
 HBV goes through cycles of replication and non-replication
 lagbhag 50% rogi teevr punarskriyan kaa anubhav karte hai
 Male patients with a baseline ALT of 200 ul / L are three times more likely to develop reactivation than lower levels
 comotherapy se guzarane vaale rogi echbivi ke punarskriyan ke khatre par hote hai
 The current view is that drugs that suppress immunity aid enhanced HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic t cell function in the liver
 2004 tak, ek anumaan ke anusaar 350 million echbivi sankramit vyakti duniya bhar main hai
 The range of national and regional spread is more than 10% in Asia and less than 0
5% in the US and northern Europe
 sankraman ke margon main urdhwadhar sancharan, praarambhik jivan kshaitij sancharan or vayask kshaitij sancharan shaamil hai
 The primary method of transmission refers to the spread of chronic HBV infection in a given area

 In areas with low prevalence, including Eastern Europe, Russia and Japan, where 2â7% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is mainly spread to children
 ucch prasar vaale kshetron jaise ki china or dakshin purv asia main shishujanm ke samay sancharan saamaanya he, haalanki ucch sthaniktaa kshetron jaise ki africa main shishujanm ke samay sancharan ek mahatvapurn kaarak he
 The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in high endemic areas is at least 8%

 antarctic prithvi kaa iklauta mahadweep he jahaan koi manushya mul rup se nahin rahata tha or yah sandhi vyavastha antarctic ke vishay main sabhi antararashtriya sambandhon ko nirdhaarit karata he
 The Antarctic Treaty came into force from 1961 and by 2016, 53 countries had signed it
 is sandhi ke antargat antarctic ko ek vaigyanik sangrakshit kshetra ghoshit kar diya gaya or is mahadweep par kisi bhi prakaar kii sainik kaarywai par pabandi laga di gai
 Also, an annual "antarctic Treaty Consultation Meeting" tradition was initiated to decide on Antarctica cases
 jab sandhi par pehle hastakshar hue tab saat desh antarctic ke alag-alag kshetron par apni samprabhutaa kaa daawa karte the, yani un kshetron ko apane deshon kaa bhaag bataate the
 The treaty said that no signer is neither withdrawing from his claim, neither accepting the claim of anyone else nor making any new claim
 misaal ke liye france antarctic ke aadeli dharti naamak kshetra ko apana hissaa maanata he lekin sandhi ke antargat vah is daawey ko kisi or se manwaane main aksham he
 On the other hand, India does not accept the sovereignty of any country over any region of Antarctica and considers the entire continent the property of the entire human race
 antarctic sandhi main do prakaar ke sadsy desh hai - paramarshi or aparamarshi 
 According to the treaty, when the Antarctic Treaty Consultation Meeting takes place every year, the consulting countries have the right to vote on the proposals, but non-diaspora members do not have this right
 paramarshi sadsy banane ke liye kisi desh ko yah dikhaanaa hota he ki vah antarctic main anusandhan karne main sakriya he
 One aspect of this activism is to establish a research center in Antarctica where scientific teams from that country can work and live
 antarctic kaa vaataavaran kathor he or vahaan pahunchnaa bhi durgam he isaliye yah kam hi desh kar paae hai
 In 2016, out of more than 200 total countries in the world, the Antarctic Treaty had 53 members, of which only 29 held consultative status
