 The Iranians say that if the names of the seas are to be changed, then the name of the Arabian Sea should be changed to Makran Sagar because more than one hundred million non-arab people are inhabited around it and the use of this name is also used for Portuguese colonialism

 atah aap se prashn kiya gaya ki aapke pita ne aap se kya kaha? aapane uttar diya ki main is rahasy ko apane pita ke jivan main kisi se nahin bataauungi
 You revealed this secret after the Prophet's exile
 or kaha ki mere pita ne mujh se kaha tha ki i fatima aap mere parivaar main se sabase pehle mujh se bhent karogi
 And i was delighted for that reason
 ek din hazarat paigambar apane mitron ke saath masjid main baithe hue the
 At the same time, a man came there whose clothes were torn and his face was impoverished
 vriddhavastha ke kaaran uske sharir kii shakti ksheen ho chuki thi
 The Prophet approached him and questioned him about it
 He said that i am a beggar of misery
 main bhookha hoon mujhe bhojan karaao, main vastraheen hoon mujhe pahanane ke liye vastra do, main kangaal hoon meri aarthik saahayata karo
 The Prophet said that i do not have anything at this time but since giving someone a way to do good is also like doing good work
 is liye paigambar ne usko hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ke ghar kaa pataa bataa diya
 Because his house was adjacent to the mosque, he quickly came to his door and pleaded for help
 hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ne kaha ki is samay mere paas kuch nahin he jo main tuje de sakun
 But i have a garland, you can sell it and fulfill your needs
 yah kahkar apane gale se maala utaar kar us ko dedi
 This mala was gifted by Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha, the Chacha of Hazrat Prophet
 vah is maala ko lekar paigambar ke paas aayaa tathaa kaha ki fatima ne yah maala di he
 And said that i should sell it and fulfill my needs
 
 The Prophet wept upon seeing this garland
 ammare yasir naamak aapke ek mitra aapke paas baithe hue the
 He said that allow me to buy this garland, the Prophet said that Allah will not surprise anyone who buys this garland
 ammaar ne us daridr se poocha ki tum is maala ko kitne main benchnaa chaahate ho? usne uttar diya ki main isko itane mulya par bench duungaa jitne main mujhe pahanane ke liye vastra khaane ke liye roti gosht mil jaye tathaa ek dinar mare paas batch jaye jisase main apane ghar jasakun
 Ammar Yasir said that i buy it in exchange for food cloth and twenty dinars
 vah daridr shighrata purvak taiyaar ho gaya
 Thus, Ammare Yasir bought this garland and smelled it
 tathaa apane das ko dekar kaha ki yah maala paigambar ko bhent kar va maine tuje bhi paigambar kii bhent kiya
 The Prophet also presented the garland and the slave Hazrat Fatimah Salamullah Alaiha
 hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ne maala ko le liya tathaa das se kaha ki maine tuje allaah ke liye swatantra kiya
 Das started laughing after hearing this
 hazarat fatima ne hagansane kaa kaaran poocha to usne kaha ki mujhe is maala ne hansaaya kyon ki is ne ek bhukhe ko bhojan karaayaa, ek vastraheen ko vastra pahanaaye ek paidal chalane vaale ko sawari pradaan kii ek daridr ko maldaar banaaya ek das ko swatantra karaayaa or ant main swany apane maalik ke paas aagai

 yadhyapi yah pustak apane mul rup main nahin rah gayi he, phir bhi uplabdh anuwaadon ke aadhaar par isaki rachana teesri shatabdi isa purv ke aas- paas nirdhaarit kii gai he
 The author of this book is Pt
 Vishnu Sharma
 uplabdh pramaanon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki jab is granth kii rachana puri hui, tab unki umr lagbhag 80 varsh thi
 Panchatantra is divided into five systems: manovigyaan, vyavhaarikta tathaa rajkaaj ke siddhanton se parichit karaati ye kahaniyaan sabhi vishyon ko bade hi rochak tareeke se saamne rakhti he tathaa saath hi saath ek sikh dene kii koshish karti he
 In many stories of Panchatantra, in addition to human characters, many times animals and birds have also been made the character of the story and an attempt has been made to tell them many instructive things
 panchatantra kii kahaniyaan bahut jeevant hai
 In them, public behavior is explained in a very simple way
 bahut se log is pustak ko netritv kshamta viksit karne kaa ek shashakt madhyam maanate hai
 The importance of this book is propounded by the fact that it has been translated into almost every language of the world
 nitikthaon main panchatantr kaa pehla sthaan he
 The Panchatantra is the basis of the composition of the interests
 swayan narayan pandit ji ne sweekaar kiya he- Its composition is set around the third century, based on the various available translations
 panchatantra kii rachana kis kaal main hui, yah nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki panchatantra kii mul prati abhi tak uplabdh nahin he
 Some scholars have presented their views about the author of Panchatantra and its creation period in the language style of Panchatantra
 mahamahopadhyaay pan sadashiv shastri ke anusaar panchatantra ke rachayita vishnusharma the or vishnusharma chanakya kaa hi doosraa naam tha
 Therefore, the Panchatantra was composed during the time of Chandragupta Maurya and its composition period was 300 BC
 may be considered
 par paashchaatya tathaa kuch bhartiya vidvan aisa nahin maanate, unka kathan he ki chanakya kaa doosraa naam vishnugupt tha vishnusharma nahin, tathaa uplabdh panchatantra kii bhashaa kii drushti se to yah guptakaleen rachana prathit hoti he
 Mahamahopadhyaya Pt Durgaprasad Sharma has considered the time of Vishnusarma in the middle of the Ashtamashakta because the first system of Panchatantra saw the Arya Arya of Kuttinimat composed by Damodar Gupta of the eighth century A
D
 Must have occurred in parantu keval ukt shloke ke adhar par panchatantra kii rachana ashtum shatak main nahin maani ja sakati, kyonki yah shloke kisi sanskaran main prakshipt bhi ho saktaa he
 Hertel and Dr
 Keith, its composition 200 BC Is in favor of obeying
 chanakya ke arthshaastra kaa prabhaav bhi panchatantra main dikhaai detaa he iske adhar par bhi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki chanakya kaa samay lagbhag chaturth shatabdi purv kaa he atah panchatantra kii rachana teesri shatabdi ke purv hui hogi
 Thus, none of the views regarding the creation of Panchatantra is completely unanimous
 sanskaran-panchatantra ke chaar sanskaran uplabdh he- The first edition is the Pahlavi translation of the original text, which is now received in the form of Syrian and Arabic translations
 dwitiya sanskaran ke rup main panchatantra gunadhyakrut ‘brihatkatha’ main dikhaai padataa he
 'brihatkatha was composed in the Paisachi language but its original form has been destroyed and the Kshemarikrit' Brihatkatha Manjari 'and' Kathasaritsagar 'written by Somdev are translations of the same
 tritiy sanskaran main tantrakhyayika evam usase sambaddh jain kathaon kaa sangrah he
 'tantrayakhya' is considered to be the most ancient
 iskaa mul sthaan kashmir he
 The famous German scholar Dr
 Hertel discovered the authentic version with great exertion
 inke anusaar ‘tantrakhyayika’ yaa tantrakhya hi panchatantra kaa mularoop he
 This is the prevalent 'panchatantra' of the modern era
 chaturth sanskaran dakshini ‘panchatantra’ kaa mularoop he tathaa iskaa pratinidhitiv nepali ‘panchatantra’ evam ‘hitopadesh’ karte hai
 Thus 'panchatantra' is a representative of a huge literature rather than a book
 vishwa-sahitya main bhi panchatantra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 It has been translated into many foreign languages
 in anuwaadon main pahalavi bhashaa kaa ‘kartakadamanak’ naam kaa anuwaad hi sabase pracheen anuwaad mana jaataa he
 According to Winternitz, the greater influence of Panchatantra is seen on German literature
 isi prakaar greek kii isap kii kahaniyon kaa tathaa arab kii 'arebian nits' aadi kathaon kaa aadhaar panchatantra hi he
 It is believed that the Panchatantra has been translated into about 50 diverse languages so far and there have been about 200 versions of it
 yahi isaki lokapriyata kaa parichaayak he
 There are five tantras or divisions in the Panchatantra
 vibhaag ko tantra isliye kaha gaya he kyonki inamen naitiktapurna shashan kii vidhiyaan bataayin gayin hai
 These systems are friendly, friendly, attaining Kakolukiyam, beneficial and obtrusive
 sankshep main in tantron kii vishaywastu is prakaar he- There is a main story in the fables and there are many minor stories to corroborate it
 Similarly, in this first system called 'mitradhabha', the story of Amarashakti, the king of Mahilaropya in the south of Angikatha, is told that he is his The reason for the foolish sons was anxious and hence they entrust a scholar named Vishnusharma to educate their sons and Vishnusharma was given to them
 They are successful in educating through stories in the month itself
 tatpashchaat mitrabhed naamak bhaag kii angi-katha main, ek dusht siyaar dwaara pingalak naamak singh ke saath sanjeevak naamak bail kii shatruta utpann karaane kaa varnan he jise singh ne aapatti se bachaaya tha or apane do mantriyon- karkat or damanak ke virodh karne par bhi use apana mitra bana liya tha
 Many types of teachings have been given in this system, such that a person can face even the most difficult situation with patience, so one should not give up patience even if destiny worsens
 is tantra main mitra kii prapti se kitna sukh evam anandaprapt hota he vah kapotraj chitragriv kii katha ke madhyam se bataaya gaya he
 Only friend helps in disaster- aisa kaha gaya he ki mitra kaa ghar main aana swarg se bhi adhik sukh ko detaa he
 Thus, the precept of this system is that only useful friends should be made, as the crow, turtle, deer and rat remain happy on the strength of friendship
 isamen yuddh or sandhi kaa varnan karte hue ulluon kii guha ko kauon dwaara jala dene kii katha kahi gayi he
 It states that for self-realization, the enemy should also be made a friend and later be seen and destroyed
 is tantra main bhi kaua ullu se mitrataa kar letaa he or baad main ullu ke kile main aag lagava detaa he
 Therefore, you should stay safe from enemies because a person who falls in laziness and ignores enemies and disease - does not try to stop him, he is killed by the same - is tantra main vanar or magaramchh kii mukhya katha he or anya avaantar kathaayen hai
 It has been told in these stories that how was the achievement of the desired, that is, that it was destroyed
 isamen vanar or magaramchh kii katha ke madhyam se shiksha di gai he ki budhimaan apane buddhible se jeet jaataa he or murkh haath main ai hui vastu se bhi vanchit rah jaataa he
 Particularly in this last system of Panchatantra, emphasis has been laid on the policy of doing well thought out work because a person who does a work without thinking well and listening well does not get success in the work but many difficulties in life Have to face
 atah andhanukaran nahin karnaa chahie
 In the main story of this system, there is a story of a blindfolded hairdresser who was executed by the judges on the guilt of slaying the Jain-sannyas, following the Seth named Manibhadra
 atah bina pariksha kiye hue nai ke samaan anuchit kaary nahin karnaa chahie- It also states that no action should be done even without full knowledge because later one has to repent as if a Brahmin wife killed a blood-soaked mongoose without looking at it thinking that it had eaten my son
 So to protect the child from the snake, the snake was killed, due to which its face was stained with blood
 isliye kaha gaya- Thus, Panchatantra is a didactic work
 isamen lekhakane apni vyavhaar kushalta rajnatikpatutaa evam gyaan kaa parichay diya he
 Non-human characters of ethics are often of two types, living beings and unconscious matter
 panchatantra main bhi ye do prakaar ke paatr dekhe jate hai- pashuon main singh, vyaghr, shrigal, shashak, vrishabh, gadhaa, aadi, pakshiyon main kaak, uluk, kapot, mayur, chatak, shuk aadi tathaa itar praaniyon main sarp, nakul, pipilika aadi
 Apart from these, river, sea, tree, mountain, cavity etc
 are also unconscious characters, which have been accused of human behavior
 panchatantra main maanav ko vyavhaar kushal banane kaa prayaas atyadhik saral evam rochak style main kiya gaya he
 Explaining the purpose of Panchatantra, Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has written that- aliganj sangrampur, munger, bihar sthit ek gaanv he

 team ke kapadon par prayojak kaa kaarobaari pratik chihn pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 Studies the properties of the flow of fluids under liquefaction
 praudyogiki main draviki kaa upyog anya kaaryon ke alaava sanket, bal yaa urja ke sancharan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The idea of engineering elements in fluids comes under which water, air and oil and other chemical solutions are used in natural conditions or under pressure
 in dravon ke prakritik gunon kaa, jaise ghanatv, shyanta, pratyasthata or prishth tanaav aadi, ke upar ejiniyari ke samast abhikalp nirbhar hote hai, kyonki saare dravon kaa aadharbhoot vyavhaar ek sa hi hota he
 There are many more specialized parts of water engineering, details of which can be found under those special organs
 jal ejiniyari main mukhyat: jal kaa sthir dabaav, uski gati tathaa uskaa prabhaav, uske dwaara chaalit yantra jal kaa maapan aadi vishyon kaa vichaar aa jaataa he
 With regard to water engineering, it is necessary to first study the permanent pressure of water
 yah sthaayee dabaav kaa vishay dravasthiti vigyaan kehalaata he
 When any kind of motion occurs in the water, the problem becomes complicated
 anyaanya dravon kii bhanti jal kii bhi yah visheshta hoti he ki vah prithvi ke gurutv ke kaaran swayan chaalak ho jaataa he or yah gun sthiti ke anukool ghatata badhata rahata he
 The thinking of the engineer is different from the thinking of the mathematician in this regard
 ganitagya bahut si baton kaa nidaan kaalpanik paristhitiyon par nirbhar rahakar karte hai
 In the view of engineers, depending on the actual conditions
 ejiniyaron ke vichaar main vaastavik sthitiyon kaa jal sambandhi samasyaon par bada prabhaav padataa he
 Many basic facts are calculated to solve these problems, such as energy indestructibility, conservation of mass, conservation of solvation etc
 jal ejiniyari kaa koi bhi prashn ho, vah inamen se do aadharbhoot tathyon par avashya hi nirbhar hoga
 In the 18th century, the Swiss engineer, Daniel Bernuli, proposed that the particles of any fluid in the path of motion have the same energy or the sum of motion energy and potential energy is the same
 is siddhanth se bahut si samasyaon kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 For example, one pump extracts one cubic foot of water per second
 uske ek sire par pani kaa veg 10 foot prati second he or duusari ore pani kaa veg 20 foot prati second he, pehle sire par veg kaa dabaav 1
56 foot he or duusare sire par 6
24 foot he
 Therefore, the pump put additional pressure 50
68 feet above the water
 maap 46 foot hi dikhaai padati he, kyonki baaki kaa dabaav veg dabaav main parivartit ho gaya
 Bernuli's fact solves many problems
 pani ke bahaav main or bhi bahut si baton kaa nidaan karnaa padataa he, jaise chote-bade nikaason se pani kaa viratan, nikaas maarg ke sankuchit hone se bahaav kii sthiti main ghataav-badhaav, nikaas maarg kii banaavat tathaa uske aakaar kaa jalanissaran par prabhaav, niksaa maarg main chote bade bhanvar paidaa ho janaa, in sab baton kaa lagaav naharon ke liye, yaa jal-prasadan-kendron main jalavitaran ke liye kiye gaye sadhano par hota he
 Designs of great works are made by considering these things in the canals
 vastav main jal ejiniyari main aisi bahut si baton kaa samanvay hota he jinka ganit ke dwaara samaadhaan hona sambhav nahin
 Hence, many problems are solved by making small models ie small size samples
 in namoonon yaa modelon main pani pravesh karakar or uski chaal ko maapkar yah baat nirdhaarit kii jaati he ki vibhinn abhikalpon se banaae kaaryon par pani ke vyaavhaarik bahaav se kya prabhaav padegaa
 From these experiments, it can be estimated that with the pressure of water or by the flow of water, the work created by a particular design starts to stagnate or become stable
 vaise to jal sambandhit kaaryon kaa nirmaan drav ejiniyari ke mul siddhanton par hi nirbhar hota he, kintu un kaaryon kii vyaavhaarik sucharutha evam sampannataa or sthirataa kaa thik anumaan model ke prayog dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In the navigational work where large ships are built, the efficiency and traffic ability of ships are estimated by small models
 pani ke bahaav main gharshan dwaara bahut se dabaav kaa kshay hota he
 For this reason, water is not able to get out of favorable pressure at water supply sites at high or distance places
 vaise khuli naharon main bhi gharshan dwaara dabaav kaa kshay hota he
 Many means are presented by water engineering in such a way that the pressure decay is minimized
 isaliye pani ke margo ko pakkaa yaa chikna karne ke saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 There is a loss of pressure in the tubes where there are joints or turns or where the tubes are the smallest
 dabaav ke is kshay kaa anumaan barnuli ke sameekaran dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 In large ponds or reservoirs or in fulfillment of special works, water erosion occurs by planting in the ground
 iske liye bhi jal ejiniyari ke siddhanton dwaara aise saadhan jutaaye jate hai jinase yaa to sarpan bilkul band ho jaay athwa sanrpan dwaara pani itane hi veg se bahe, jisase bhoomi ke kan hatane na paaen
 If the ground particles start to move, then the result is that inside the work based on the design, there is a pole and the stability of the work is at risk
 is sambandh main bahut sa kaary bhinn-bhinn deshon main ho chukaa he
 a lot of work has been created based on the "draining" principle laid down by Bilai
 is siddhant kaa mul yah tha ki yadi sanrpan kaa maarg lanbaa kar diya jaay to usase nikaas kaa veg kam ho jaayga
 After this, Indian engineer Khosla declared another fact, on the basis of which a lot of works were created
 jal ejiniyari kaa mahatvapurn kshetra bade-bade band tathaa nadiyon main roak yaa baraaj banane kaa he
 Where dams are built to store water, there is a big search to check the stability of dams
 saadhaarant: jitna unchaa band ho uski ek tihaai tal kii chaudaai honi chahie
 For this, the mathematics-line-diagnosis is performed and its performance is shown in Figure 3
 yah saadhaaran bhu-aakarshan par sthit kancreet baandh kaa abhikalp he
 In addition to the weight of water in these designs, the effect of waves, the effect of earthquake, the effect of wind and many other things also have to be considered
 phir, aajkal vyay main bachat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ye band bhi vividh prakaar se banane lage hai or band kaa nirmaan jal ejiniyari kii vishesh shakha ban gai he
 When water comes out under very high pressure, the capacity of the same canopy increases greatly
 badi badi chattaane uske kaaran cat jaati hai
 Therefore, the problem of drainage of excess water on very large dams is very serious
 uske nikaas sthal ko vishesh rup se pakkaa banaaya jaataa he
 Somewhere, in order to expend the power created in water, a shape of a spherical plane has to be made
 is prakaar neeche girakar jal kuch upar uthta he or usamen nihit shakti kaa hraas ho jaataa he; iske uparaant us jal kii kataanakshmata kam ho jaati he
 Many other resources are used to spend power created in water
 jal ejiniyari kii ek vishesh yukti saadhaaran panchakki se sabandhit he
 This is the trick in progress in the production of hydroelectric power
 iske dwaara jal ke dabaav se panbizli ke janitr ko ghumaya jaataa he
 Due to its operation, electricity is generated
 uske do praturup hai
 One is where the turbine's rotating fans are such that they rotate under water pressure
 inako pratikriya tarabine kaha jaataa he
 They are especially used where water is high
 duusare prakaar ke tarabine aaveg tarabine, yani chot khaakar chalanevaale tarabine hote hai
 In these, the wheel of the turbine rotates with a water blade and it rotates the generator which generates electricity
 ejiniyari ke kshetra main jal ejiniyari kaa sthaan mahatvapurn he
 There is a large use of water in the field of industry
 baari se baari dabaav utpann karne ke liye jalprerit press kaam main laae jate hai
 These are called hydraulic presses
 in preson kaa vistaar bade se bada ho saktaa he
 Steam engines are made by running water from it
 railgadee kaa ingine jal kii bhaap se hi chalata he
 Although it is not a full-fledged field of water engineering, steam and water are governed on almost the same principle as both remain in liquid state
 jal yaa bhaap main jitna adhik dabaav hota he usee maatra main unamem shakti sanchit hoti he
 Whether the pressure is caused by a natural high position or by artificial means
 jal ke dabaav ke kaaran hi kahin-kahin jal ke jeton dwaara bahut se kaam kiye jate hai
 In many cities, water jets are used for cleaning etc
 is prakaar ke dabaav se kheti-baari main bhi bauchhaar dwaara pani kaa vitaran kiya jaataa he or ek prakaar kii varsha kii jaati he
 Scientifically, by creating excessive pressure, so much power is created in the water stream that it can cut even big things
 yathesht dabaav dwaara yah dhar steel kii paraton tak ko bhi kaatane kii kshamta rakhti he
 a pressure of about 10,000 pounds per square inch is required for that
 jab kisi nikaay main aisi vyavastha ho ki output kaa ek bhaag input main diya ja rahaa ho to is vyavastha kaa naam punarbharan yaa feedback he
 Recharge is a useful concept
 swatah niyantran main iskaa atyadhik upyog hota he
 There are mainly two types of recharge - positive recharge and negative recharge
 tao te ching yaa daao de jing prasiddh chini darshanik lao tsu dwaara rachit ek dharm granth he jo tao dharm kaa mukhya granth bhi mana jaataa he
 Its name is derived from the first word of its two divisions - 'dao' and 'de' - which end with 'jing'
 paaramparik manyata ke anusaar lao tsu china ke jhou rajvansh kaal main sarkari abhilekhi the or unhone is granth ko chhathi sadi isapurv main likhaa tha, haalanki isaki rachana kii asaliyat par vivaad jari he
 Its oldest manuscripts date back to the fourth century BC
 tao te ching granth kaa sabase pehla vaakya he 'jis maarg ke bare main baat kii ja sake vah sanathan maarg nahin he'
 This word 'marg' is used again and again throughout the text and mutual debate about it has been going on for thousands of years

 The biggest difference between the gimmick and the farce is believed to be that while the farce mostly deals with religious themes and is displayed a little seriously, the gimmick of the gimmick is based on love and heroism and blends satire and tension
 Let's go

 The high-ranking people of the society considered it 'cheap' and 'vulgar' but this folk art flourished
 adhiktar samikshakon kaa maananaa he ki 'nautanki swang style kaa hi ek viksit rup he'
 Nautanki stories often take place on a person or an important subject, such as the gimmick of alha-udal
 isi tarah, 'sultanaa daaku' kii nautanki isi naam ke uttar pradesh ke bijanour zile main hue ek daaku kii kahani bataati he
 During the freedom struggle of India, there were many gimmicks on that subject, which inspired the common people to join this struggle
 aajkal dahez-kupratha, aatankwaad or sampradayik ladaai-jhagadon ke viruddh nautankiyan dekhi ja sakati hai
 To maintain the interest of the audience, gimmicks often contain certain elements of courtship that can also be used for obscenity
 isliye bahut si ashleel nautankiyan bhi dedh-sau saal se chalati aa raheen hai, jis se aksar nautanki kii style badnaam bhi hoti ai he
 Traditionally, in order to make money in gimmicks, it was necessary to never let the audience get bored, so most gimmicks were made by combining events of 10 minutes or less in a sequence that would interest the audience in each part

 Since conversion is a change in values that embraces God and rejects sin, it includes a personal approach to a life of holiness described by Paul of Tarsus and exemplified by Jesus Christ
 Commitment is included
