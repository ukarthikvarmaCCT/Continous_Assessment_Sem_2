 o honest, when you call our Rasool for such a work which is the bane of your spiritual life, then you should accept the command of God and Rasool from the heart and know that God is such a Qadir that it comes between man and his heart
 Go and also understand that all of you will be present in front of him and be afraid of the fate that will not fall on those people who have persecuted you and believe That God is going to be very tough because when you were very low and absolutely helpless in the land, you used to be afraid that if people do not take you away, then God sheltered you and specially helped you and helped you and you The Pakiza was given to eat things so that you can live the same
 The believers do not take care of God and Rasool, nor do they care for their own insults, although you understand and know f your goods and your children are things your Ajhmais that their Do not forget God even in love and he is humble and for sure God is a big wage
 If you are afraid of God, he will create Imtiaz for you and will give you a spree of crime and will give you strength and Good sir Yes, they were doing it and God was also doing it, and God is better than all those who take care of themselves and when our verses are read in front of them, they say that we have heard it, but if we want to, we will surely do the same
 You can also say - it is just because of the faces and when those infidels had prayed that if God is right and from you, then it hurts stones from the sky or any other painful surprise on us
 However, as long as you are present through him, God will not touch him

 Ordinary 6-volt automobile batteries have three cells graded
 prayek cell main amleey vidyut apghaty, jo praaia: salphurik amla hota he, tathaa apane do yaa adhik rasinic roopon main sis ke electrode rahete hai
 Electrodes are often called money or minus plates
 ye patticas sanrachaneey frem tathaa vidyut chaalak se yukt rahati hai, jise grid kehete hai
 The grid is made of metallic lead or alloy and active lead
 sakriy grid lead avkaash ko bharta he tathaa aavashyak vidyut rasinic kaary karata he
 The grid is made by alloying with a low fractional percentage of lead, antimony, tin, bismuth, arsenic and other elements
 dhan patitaka main sakriy padaarth lead paroxide, he
 The active substances of the loan strip are: porous, finely divided, self-bonding metallic pure lead and low-cost material, whose function is to maintain stability
 bydaree ke jeevankaal main rin pattica baar-baar aaweshit or visarjeet hoti he, at: rin patitaka kii sanrandhrata ko banaae rakhan ke liye yojya padaarthon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 By placing a separator in the middle of the alternating money and loan plates, separate these two plates and arrange the time
 pruthakkaarak dhan or rin patticoon ko ek duusare se chune se bachaata he
 The separator must be acid resistant and easily permeable for electrolytes and electrolytes
 yah pargamyata sookshm sanrandhra honi chahie jisase bydaree kii kriya ke samay dhan patticoon se nikalate hue sakriy padaarthon ke kanon kaa pravesh na ho
 The posterior part of the debt plate of the separator is flat and the opposite side of the money plate is flat or striped
 saamanyat: lakdi kaa upyog pruthakkaarak ke rup main adhik hota he
 Most of the resins and acids used for separators are extracted by chemical reaction
 deodaar kii kuch kismon kii lakdi pruthakkaarak ke liye atyuttam siddh hui he : sookshm randhra vaale rabar ke kritrim pruthakkaarak kaa upyog bhi atyadhik kiya ja rahaa he
 Artificial separators are used to withstand high temperatures related to climate or variable charge rates
 pruthakkari ko sanrandhra padaarth kii, jaise shishe ke tantu yaa chhidril rabar kii, sahaayak chadar se prachlit kar diya jaataa he
 This vowel is placed opposite the side of the money plate
 jab bydaree adhik kaary karti he, tab iske jeevankaal main yah prabalan sakriy padaarth ke chhadak ke niyantran main sahaayak hota he
 In a lead acid battery, the electrolyte is usually diluted sulfuric acid, which changes along with the state of charge of the battery
 jab bydaree aaweshit rahati he, tab salphurik amla kii tanuta adhik hoti he or bydaree ke visarjeet ho jane par amla sandra hota jaataa he
 When the batteries are fully charged, the relative dissipation of the electrolytes of most batteries is about 1
280, but this density is 1
125 in hot climates and 1
300 in frosty climates
 saamanyat:, vidyut apghaty kaa 1

 When the accumulator remains charged, lead, minus plaque and lead oxide, act as money plates
 ye donon patticas salphurik amla ke vidyut apghaty main dubi rahati he
 During the immersion, chemical changes take place in the active substance and electrolytes
 rin pattica kaa lead do electron,, se vanchit hota, jabaki dhan pattica kaa lead oxide do electron arjeet karata he
 The following reaction takes place on a loan board: dhan pattica par nimnlikhit samakalik abhikriya hoti he : Lead monoxide reacts with sulfuric acid to produce the following fruits: visarjan kaal main dhan or rin donon patticas lead sulphate se aachhadit ho jaati hai
 At this time the relative density of electrolytes, ie, sulfuric acid, decreases, because some sulfuric acid is converted into water
 bydaree ke kriyasheel rahete samay jis disha main dhara chalati he uske vipareet dhara pravaahit kar bydaree ko aaweshit kiya jaataa he, jiske kaaran bydaree apni mul dasha ko pun: praapt kar leti he, arthath dhan pattica kaa lead sulphate, lead oxide kii purvavastha main aa jaataa he
 Thus the hydrogen ion on the minus plate frees two electrons
 isaki abhikriya nimnlikhit he : The sulfate ion liberates two electrons on the fillet, the reaction of which is as follows: chunki plumbik sulphate pani main sthaayee nahin he, at: antim abhikriya is prakaar hoti he : The relative density of the electrolyte is increased by the reaction of charge
 aavesh or visarjan kaa chakra us samay tak chalata rahata he, jab tak bydaree kii bhautik sanrachana vaidyut apghaton ke kaaran yaa pruthakkaarak padaarth ke oxikaran ke kaaran nasht nahin ho jaati
 The efficiency of the battery is affected by the change of heat
 nimna taap nimna dakshata kaa kaaran hota he
 The efficiency of the battery also depends on the rate at which the battery is charged and immersed
 jab bydaree dhire dhire aaweshit kii jaati he or vah dhire dhire visarjeet hoti he, tab bydaree kii dakshata atyadhik hoti he
 In this type of battery, electrolytic, alkali instead of acid
 sarvaadhik prachlit kshareey bydaree edison cell prakaar kii bydaree he
 This battery is a nickel-iron alkaline type cell

 Very few people are aware of his remarkable role in the efforts made for national independence
 vastusthiti yah he ki paradheen aryaavart main yah kehane kaa saahas sambhavat: sarvapratham swami dayanand saraswati ne hi kiya tha ki "aryaavart, aryavartiyon kaa he"
 The entire plan of our First Independence Summer, 1857 revolution was also prepared under Swamiji's leadership and he was also its principal architect
 ve apane pravachanon main shrotaaon ko praaia: rashtrawaad kaa upadesh dete or desh ke liye mar mitane kii bhaavana bharte the
 In 1855, when the Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar, Swamiji traveled from Abu Mountains to Haridwar to join it
 raste main unhone sthaan-sthaan par pravachan kiye tathaa deshavaasiyon kii nabj tatoli
 He realized that people are now fed up with the tyrannical rule of the British and are eager to fight for the independence of the country
 swami dayanand saraswati ne haridwar pahunch kar vahaan ek pahari ke ekaant sthaan par apana deraa jamaaya
 While there, he met five such people who later became the masters of the revolution of 1857
 ye paanch vyakti the naanaa sahib, ajimullah khan, bala sahab, tathya tope tathaa babu kunwar singh
 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country
 jansadharan tathaa aryavartiya sainikon main is kranti kii aawaaj ko pahunchane ke liye 'roti tathaa camel' kii bhi yojana yaheen taiyaar kii gai
 The main role in this entire discussion was that of Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 vichaar vimarsh tathaa yojana-nirdhaaran ke uparant swami ji to haridwar main hi ruk gaye tathaa anya paanchon rashtriya netaa yojana ko yatharth rup dene ke liye apane-apane sthanon par chale gaye
 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge
 isi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone arya samaaj kii bhi sthapana kii or uske madhyam se samaaj-sudhaar ke anek kaary kiye
 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, British officials had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different types of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human
 unke antim shabd the - "prabhu! tuune acchhee lila kii
 May your wish be fulfilled

 The Triton moves retrograde in its orbit around Varuna and its structure is similar to that of the planet Yama, leading to the scientific inference that the Triton formed in a Kiper circle away from Varuna and wandered to Varun where He gets caught by Varun's bodybuilder gravity and has been circling him ever since

 Dante Alligieri was a medieval Italian poet
 ye virgil ke baad italy ke sabase mahaan kavi kahe jate hai
 He was also the President of Italy
 unka suprasiddh mahakavy divine kamedia apane dhang kaa anupam pratik mahakavy he
 Additionally, his lyrical Vita Nyuova, meaning New Life, is a collection of poignant poems, in which he recounts the love story of his beloved Sitrice and the poignant viraha tale on his death in 23 years
 inkaa janm europe main, italy main hua tha
 They were citizens of Florence
 unka parivaar pracheen tha, phir bhi ucchwargeey nahin tha
 He was born at a time when a revival of medieval ideology and culture was beginning
 raajnneeti ke vichaaron or kala sambandhi manyataon main bhi parivartan ho rahaa tha
 Dante is considered the best poet of Italy, in relation to which the English poet Shelley has said that, dante kaa kavy us sethu ke samaan he jo kaal kii dhara par bana he or pracheen vishwa ko aadhunik vishwa se milaataa he
 Dante wrote his epic in simple colloquial Italian language, not writing in Latin language, and made his mother tongue and popular language proud with his great works
 yah kaary tulsidas ke ramcharitamanas ke bhashaa main likhane ke samaan tha
 In fact, this time was the time for the movement of the prestige of Lokbhasha all over the world
 bharat main bhi ramanand, gyaneshwar, namdev, vidyapati, kabir, sur, tulsidas, ityadi ne isi prakaar lokbhasha main sahitya rachana kaa aandolan kiya
 In fact, this work of Dante was a conch shell of epochal change
 italvi bhashaa main divine kamedia dwaara dante kaa sthaan amar he
 Dante was not only a poet and thinker, he was also a political leader and administrator
 unhone florence rajya par shashan bhi kiya
 But his art and poetry ideas are found in his work De Vulgari Eloquyo
 ve utkrisht kavita se hi santusht naa hokar yah bhi bataate hai, ki sarvotkrisht kavita kin baton par nirbhar karti he
 He made a revolutionary effort against Greek and Latin traditions by giving subjects like love and folklore the importance of his works
 dante ke vichaar se parishthit saushthavpurn bhashaa, uttam abhivyanjana style tathaa upyukt vishaywastu kaa saamanjasy hone par hi shreshth rachana sambhav ho sakati he
 In this way, Dante has composed his poetry by choosing the best words from the lingua franca and also from the figurative language, except for the words Bhadde and Rustic for best composition
 de valgari elocuo granth kii jorge centsbari ne bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii he
 After Dante, in Italy, such an important poetry thinker did not occur before Croche
 aaligyari daante kii greek tathaa laathini sahitya ke sivaa dharmavigyaan main bhi uski vishesh ruchi thi
 In politics, he was a follower and supporter of the soft party, but when its side was defeated by the revolutionary party of Guelph in 1301, Dante and his comrades had to bear the penalty of exile
 is sajaa ke baad durbhaagya se yadi vah florentine sarkaar ke haath pakad liya jaataa to uske jivit jala die jane tak kii sambhaavna thi
 From this time till death, he wandered from one place to another and from third to third like a pilgrim or almost like a beggar
 in dinon uski sthiti patavarviheen nauka kii tarah ho gai thi
 Stumbling rate upon rate, he experienced with great bitterness how tasteless the bread of another's house was and how much pain he felt in climbing the stairs of a foreign house

 He turned it down and decided to live on his way to the end
 san 1321 main ravenna main uski mrityu hui or vahiin vah dafnaaya gaya
 Ravenna officials are still unwilling to return her body to her native land, who had treated her with such scorn
 daante ke jivan ke saath do striyon ke naam ghanishtha rup se sambanddh hai
 One is Biatris Portinari and the other is Gemya Donati
 pehali uski yuvavastha kii preyasi thi jise usne us sam dekha tha jab vah keval nau varsh kii thi
 Even after Biatrice married Simon de Bardy and died within a short time in 1290, the teeth remained in his affection
 duusari mahila, jemya, uski vivaahita patni thi jiske saath uskaa vivaah san 1277 main hua tha
 She did not support Teeth when he was exiled
 spasht he ki daante uske vyavhaar or rang dhang se santusht na tha or baad main sambhavat: usase ghrinaa bhi karne laga tha
 For the convenience of tooth creations, we can divide it into three parts or periods
 pratham bhaag main ve kritiyaan rakhi ja sakati hai jinamein yauvan kaa utsaah or biatris ke prati uske utkar anuraag kaa dharmik roopantaran drushtigochar hota he
 Its duration can be roughly considered from 1283 to 1290
 is kaal kii sabase mukhya rachana vita nuova he
 The second part begins after the death of Viratris
 iskaa vistaar 1291 se 1313 tak rakhaa ja saktaa he
 During this period, his life was temporarily dominated by despair, sorrow and faith, and his inclination became more and more towards philosophy and science
 vah raajnneetik jhagadon kii katutaa main ek daanv pechon yaa yojanaon main lipt hota gaya
 The main compositions of this period are The Convivio, The Monarchia, The Epicles etc
 samrat henry saptam se daante ne badi badi aashaaq band rakhi thi jinpar uski mrityu ne pani pher diya
 All his plans ended abruptly, but the reward was that he could not defeat him completely
 usne ek baar phir aadhyatmik santulan kii ore kadam badhaayaa
 The ideas and beliefs of youth resurfaced in him and he became even more strongly oriented towards the worship of the Holy Spirit of the late Biatris
 'divine kamedi' kii kitni hi kavitaaon main iske pramaan bikhare pade hai
 This third period of tooth creations can be considered from 1314 to 1321, till the time of his death
 'di vita nuova' ko ham italy ke pratham premakavy kii sangya de sakate hai
 In this, we get a glimpse of the psychological analysis of the said feelings of the poet
 biatris ke pratham darshan ke baad hi kis tarah uske nae jivan kaa aarambh hua, uske hriday main kis tarah kram kram se is nari ke saundarya evam maadhurya kii bhaavana prabalatar haati gai, dhire dhire vah kis tarah uski aashaaon tathaa prem-bhakthi-upasna kaa centre banati gai, usee mrityu par use kitni maansik vednaa or akulata hui or kis prakaar uskaa parthiv prem ant main divya bhakthi ev poojabhaav main parinat hota gaya, isaki manoram jhaanki is kavy main dekhi ja sakati he
 After the death of Biatris, his attention shifted to the idyllic feelings, thoughts and selfishness for a few years, and he began to eat in the midst of disappointments or doubts
 yah ham uski duusari rachana 'conbivon' main dekh sakate hai
 In both these compositions, where and when Biotrice appears to be a statue of a supernatural beauty, and where it looks like a divine shadow from a philosophical or religious point of view, it is unnecessary to discuss it
 itnaa hi kahana alam hoga ki 'vita nuova' saamaanya premgautha na hokar ek ucch satviktaa ev shraddha kii ore kavi kaa maansik unnayan he
 There is no doubt that despite the many contradictions of hope despair, the heart of the tooth seems to be conscious of its recurrence
 vastut: kavy ke antim bhaag se hi abhas milane lagata he ki kavi ke maanas chakshu par us parloukik jagat kii chaaya padani aarambh ho chuki thi jiskaa centrebindu biatris hi thi or jiskaa paripaak uske 'divine kamedi' naamak kavy main hua
 Among the Latina compositions of teeth, 'de Monarchia' is particularly notable
 isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki samrajya kii aavashyakt ek tarah se ishvarsamarthit he
 They depict the separate territories of state and church or religious institution and emphasize that the power of the Pope should be confined to religious matters only
 use patrasangrah 'ipicills' main se bhi kai patron main isi aashay ke vichaar prakat kiye gaye hai
 There was a lot of criticism in the opposition in favor of Dante, whose fame was sometimes seen as being smeared
 phir bhi isamen andeh nahin ki vah mahaan kavi tha jisane apane parvarti anek kaviyon tathaa sahityakaron ko vyapak rup se prabhavit kiya
 With the passage of time, many scholars and thinkers have praised him very much, which helps in giving him a very high place among the writers and poets of the world today

 Devanagari is an Indian script in which many Indian languages and many foreign languages are written
 yah baayen se daayen likhi jaati he
 It is identified by a horizontal line known as 'shirirekha'

 Additionally, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bishnupuria Manipuri, Romani and Urdu languages are also written in Devanagari in some cases
 devanagari vishwa main sarvaadhik prayukt lipiyon main se ek he
 Like most languages, Devanagari is written from left to right
 prayek shabd ke upar ek rekha khinchi hoti he ise shirorekha kehete hai
 Devanagari has evolved from the Brahmi script
 yah ek dhvanyatmak lipi he jo prachlit lipiyon main sabase adhik vaigyanik he
 From this the scientific and comprehensive script is probably only Adhva script
 bharat kii kai lipiyaan devanagari se bahut adhik milti-julati hai, jaise- bangla, gujarati, gurumukhi aadi
 With the help of computer programs, interchange of Indian scripts has become very easy
 bhartiya bhashaaon ke kisi bhi shabd yaa dhwani ko devanagari lipi main jyon kaa tyon likhaa ja saktaa he or phir likhe paath ko lagbhag 'hu-ba-hu' uccharan kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki roman lipi or anya kai lipiyon main sambhav nahin he, jab tak ki unka vishesh maanakeekaran na kiya jaye, jaise itrans yaa ieesti
 It has a total of 52 letters, with 14 vowels and 38 consonants
 aksharon kii kram vyavastha bhi bahut hi vaigyanik he
 Classification of vowel-consonant, soft-hard, hypnotic-hypnotic, resonant-antasthe-heat, etc
 are also scientific
 ek mat ke anusaar devnagar me prachlan ke kaaran iskaa naam devanagari padaa
 The indications of many scripts in India and Asia are different from Devanagari, but the pronunciation and alphabet are the same as Devanagari, because they all originated from the Brahmi script
 isliye in lipiyon ko paraspar aasaani se lipyantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Devanagari is simple in terms of writing, beautiful in terms of beauty and legible in reading
 bhartiya ankon ko unki vaigyaniktaa ke kaaran vishwa ne saharsha sweekaar kar liya he
 The use of the name Devanagari or Nagari began with "why" and what was its etymological tendency - it is not yet completely certain
 'nagar' apbhransh yaa gujarati "nagar" brahmanon se uskaa sambandh bataaya gaya he
 But in the absence of strong evidence, this opinion is doubtful
 dakshin main iskaa pracheen naam "nandinagari" tha
 May be "nandinagar" is a locative and this script has something to do with it
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki "nagar" jan isamen likhaa karte the, at: "nagari" abhidhaan padaa or jab sanskrit ke granth bhi isamen likhe jane lage tab "devanagari" bhi kaha gaya
 Symbols or triangles, chakras, etc
 used in the worship of gods were called "devanagar"
 kalantar main naam ke prathamaksharon kaa unase bodh hone laga or jis lipi main unako sthaan mila- vah 'devanagari' yaa 'nagari' kahi gai
 At the core of all these aspects is the predominance of imagination, conclusive evidence is unavailable
 bharat devanagari lipi kii kshamta se shatabdiyon se parichit rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Dwarka Prasad Saxena, the first use of Devanagari script is found in the inscription of Naib Jayabhatta of Gujarat
 aathvin shatabdi main chitrakoot, naveen main baroda ke dhruvaraj bhi apane rajyadeshon main is lipi kaa upyog kiya karte the
 The Samagadha Tamrapat of Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga of 758 AD is found on which Devanagari is inscribed
 shilaharvansh ke ganndraditya ke utkeern lekh kii lipi devanagari he
 Its time is eleventh century, Cholaraja Rajendra coins of this time have been found on which the Devanagari script is inscribed
 rashtrakut raja indraraj ke lekh main bhi devanagari kaa vyavhaar kiya he
 The donation letter of Pratihara king Mahendrapal is also in Devanagari script
 kaningham kii pustak main sabase pracheen musalamaanon sikke ke rup main mahmud gajnabi dwaara chalaaye gaye chaandi ke sikke kaa varnan he jis par devanagari lipi main sanskrit ankit he
 The Devanagari script is treated with the idol of Lakshmi on the coins of Muhammad Vinsam
 shamshuddin iltutamish ke sikkon par bhi devanagari ankit he
 Sanuddin Ferozeshah I, Jalaluddin Razia, Bahram Shah, Alaluddin Marudshah, Naseeruddin Mahmood, Muizuddin, gayasuddin Balvan, Muizuddin Kaikubad, Jalaluddin Hero Sani, Alauddin Mahmad Shah etc
 have inscribed Devanagari letters on their coins
 akbar ke sikkon par devanagari main ‘ram‘ siya kaa naam ankit he
 Gaiyasuddin Tughlaq, Sher Shah Suri, Islam Shah, Muhammad Adilshah, Ghiyasuddin Ibj, Ghiyasuddin Sani etc
 followed the same tradition
 brahmi or devanagari lipi : bhashaa ko lipiyon main likhane kaa prachlan bharat main hi shuru hua
 Sumerian, Babylonian and Greek people learned it from India
 prachinkaal main brahmi or devanagari lipi kaa prachlan tha
 Other scripts around the world originated from Brahmi and Devanagari scripts
 brahmi lipi ek pracheen lipi he jisase kai asian lipiyon kaa vikaas hua he
 Brahmi, like Kharoshthi, was spread throughout Asia
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki brahmi lipi 10,000 saal puraani he lekin yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah lipi usase bhi zyada puraani he
 Emperor Ashoka also adopted this script: The great emperor Ashoka named the Brahmi script as Dhammalipi
 brahmi lipi ko devanagari lipi se bhi pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is said to be a script derived from the ancient indus-saraswati script
 hadappa samskruti ke log sindhu lipi ke alaav is lipi kaa bhi istemaal karte the, tab sanskrit bhashaa ko bhi isi lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 In linguistic terms, Devanagari script is considered as alphabetic script
 lipi ke vikassopanon kii drushti se "chitratmak", "bhavatmak" or "bhavchitratmak" lipiyon ke ananthar "aksharatmak" str kii lipiyon kaa vikaas mana jaataa he
 The alphabetic state developed after the alphabetic state of the script due to the opinion of Westerners and many Indian linguists
 sabase viksit avasthaa maani gai he dhvanyatmak lipi kii
 "devanagari" is said to be alphabetical because its characters are letters - vowels and consonants
 "k", "kha" aadi vyanjan saswar hai- akaryukt hai
 They are not only sounds but are aloud
 at: greek, roman aadi varnmalas hai
 But here it is to be kept in mind that the "panini" of the consonants in the sounds of the "brahmi" or "bharati" alphabet of India has been explained by "patanjali" in the 14 formulas of Varnasammanaya
 Is that the use of the vowel "akaar" conjugated in consonants is for the purpose of pronunciation only
 vah tatvat: varna kaa ang nahin he
 Thinking from this point of view it can be said that the alphabet of this script is essentially phonetic, not alphabetic
 devanagari kii varnmaala main 12 swar or 34 vyanjan hai
 a letter is formed by a combination of zero or one or more consonants and a vowel
 nimnlikhit swar aadhunik hindi ke liye diye gayi hai
 Their pronunciation is slightly different in Sanskrit
 sanskrit main i do swaron kaa yugma hota he or "a-i" yaa "aa-i" kii tarah bolaa jaataa he
 Similarly, au is spoken like "a-u" or "a-u"
 iske alaava hindi or sanskrit main ye varnakshar bhi swar maane jate hai : When no vowel is used, 'A' is considered there
 swar ke na hone ko halant athwa viraam se darshaya jaataa he
 Such as KGGH
 hindi bhashaa main mukhyat: arabi or farsi bhashaaon se aaye shabdon ko devanagari main likhane ke liye kuch varnon ke neeche nukta lage varnon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 But in Hindi also most people do not use nuktas
 iske alaava sanskrit, marathi, nepali evam anya bhashaaon ko devanagari main likhane main bhi nukton kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Th is mainly used in the hill languages, as in Dogri the word for "tear" is "athru"
 hindi main d or dh vyanjan farsi yaa arabi se nahin liye gayi hai, na hi ye sanskrit main paye jaye hai
 In fact, they are the changed forms of ordinary s and d in Sanskrit
 devanagari ank nimna rup main likhe jate hai : In the Devanagari script, two consonants are spelled as follows: brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main devanagari lipi sabase adhik sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detii he
 Devanagari also supports conjuncts of more than 2 dishes
 chhandas font devanagari main bahut sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detaa he
 Some of the Devanagari characters used in earlier times are different from modern Devanagari
 1
kul milakar 403 tip hone ke kaaran tankan, mundran main kathinaayee
 2

 3

 agar bharat kii sab bhashaaon ke liye iskaa vyavhaar chal pade to saare bhartiya ek duusare ke bilkul najadik aa jaaenge
 In the unity of Hindustan, Devanagari script can be more useful than Hindi itself
 anant shaynam ayangaar to dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon ke liye bhi devanagari kii sambhaavna sweekaar karte the
 Seth Govindas was in favor of declaring it a national script
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki bharat main anekon bhashaayen hona koi samasya nahin he jabaki unki lipiyaan alag-alag hona bahut badi samasya he
 Gandhiji printed a Gujarati language book in Devanagari script in 1940 and stated that its dream is that every language emanating from Sanskrit should be scripted in Devanagari
 isi prakaar vinoba bhaave kaa vichaar tha ki- The area affected by Buddhist culture is not new to Nagari

 Due to the large number of these pictures, it is very difficult to learn the language
 devvani kii vahika hone ke naate devanagari bharat kii simaaon se baahar nikalakar china or japan ke liye bhi samuchit vikalp de sakati he
 People of Indian origin are familiar with Devanagari wherever they live in the world, especially people from Mauritius, Suriname, Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad, Tubago, etc
 is tarah devanagari lipi na keval bharat ke andar saare praantvaasiyon ko prem-bandhan main baandhakar simolanghan kar dakshin-purv asia ke puraane vrihattar bhartiya parivaar ko bhi ‘bahujan hitay, bahujan sukhaay‘ anupranit kar sakati he tathaa vibhinn deshon ko ek adhik sucharu or vaigyanik vikalp pradaan kar ‘vishwa nagari‘ kii padavi kaa daawa ikkisvin sadi main kar sakati he
 The spread on it will not be the medium of scriptural imperialism and exploitation but the conductor of lofty human values like truth, non-violence, renunciation, self-control, from unrest to sata, light from tamas and immortality from death
 duniya kii kai bhashaaon ke liye devanagari sabase acha vikalp ho sakati he kyonki yah yah bolne kii puri aazaadee detaa he
 This cannot happen in any other script of the world
 indonesia, vietnam, africa aadi ke liye to yahi sabase sahi rahegaa
 Looking at Ashtadhyayi, one can understand that there is no better script in the world
 agar duniya pakshpatarahit ho to devanagari hi duniya kii sarvamaanya lipi hogi kyonki yah purnat: vaigyanik he
 For effective solution of the spelling problem in English language, Deoghari script based on Devanagari has been proposed

 In mathematics, a two-pronged equation is called a square equation or quadratic equation
 vigyaan, takneekee evam anya anek sthitiyon main kisi samasya ke samaadhaan ke samay varg sameekaran se aksar saamana pasta rahata he
 Therefore, the solution of the square equation is very important
 varg sameekaran kaa saamaanya sameekaran is prakaar kaa hota he: Here a ≠ 0
 ) You can also write the class equation as follows- kisi varg sameekaran ke gunank vaastavik sankhya yaa samishra sankhya ho sakate hai
 a square equation has two roots); That is, the given square equation for two values of variable sum can be satisfied
 ye dono mul vaastavik ho sakate hai yaa dono hi samishra sankhya ho sakate hai
 The roots of quadratic equation can be obtained with the help of the following formula: yahan "±" kaa matlab yah he ki Both are its solution
 x 2 + p x + q = 0 { \ displaystyle x^{2}+px+q=0 \ quad } ke mulon kaa sutara nimnlikhit he- Find the root of the following equation - x 2 + 16 x + 50 = 5 x 2 + 4 x + 10 { \ displaystyle x ^ {2} + 16x + 50 = 5x ^ {2} + 4x + 10} is sameekaran ko saamaanya rup main badalane par, 0 = 4 x 2 - 12 x - 40 { \ displaystyle 0 = 4x ^ {2} -12x-40} jiske mul nimnlikhit hai- x 1, 2 = - ± 2 - 4 ⋅ 4 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 4 { \ displaystyle x_ {1,2} = { \ frac {- \ pm { \ sqrt {^ {2} -4 \ cdot 4 \ cdot}} } {2 \ cdot 4}}} arthath x 1 = − 2 { \ displaystyle x_{1}=-2} tathaa x 2 = 5 { \ displaystyle x_{2}=5} To use the pq-formula, change the general form of the equation to the following form: 0 = x 2 − 3 x − 10 { \ displaystyle 0=x^{2}-3x-10} Now with pq-sutra the following basic is found- x 1, 2 = − − 3 2 ± 2 − { \ displaystyle x_{1,2}=-{ \ frac {-3}{2}} \ pm { \ sqrt { \ left^{2}-}}} That is x 1 = - 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {1} = - 2} and x 2 = 5 { \ displaystyle x_ {2} = 5} varg sameekaran ke hal bhinn-bhinn tareekon se pracheen kaal se hi nikaale jate rahe hai
 Euclid had described the geometric method of solving square equations
 aryabhatta or brahmagupta ne iske mul nikaalane kii vidhi kaa shabdon main varnan kiya he jise aadhunik bijaganitiya rup main nimnavat likh sakate hai- This samikaran should be arranged in the following form, as described in the picture on the left- isse aadhunik rup spashtatah main nimnlikhit hal praapt ho jaataa he- Brahmagupta has given the following formula for solving the square equation in the Brahmasfutasiddhanta- arth: vyakt raashi ke saath avyakt raashi ke gunank ke aadhe ke varg arthath 2) ko jodie
 Subtract half of the coefficient of the latent sum from its square root
 punah agyaat raashi ke gunank a se bhaag dijie
 This gives the value of latent zodiac
 durgbandi yaa kilabandi shatru ke pratirodh or usase raksha karne kii vyavastha kaa naam hota he
 Under this comes all the military construction and equipment used for their defense
 vartmaan samay main kilaabandi sainya ejiniyari ke antargat aati he
 It is of two types: permanent and temporary
 sthaayee kilabandi ke liye drudh durgon kaa nirmaan, jinamein suraksha ke saadhan uplabdh ho, aavashyak he
 Temporary plain fortifications are required on occasions when the armies are standing face to face in the battlefield, except for the permanent fort
