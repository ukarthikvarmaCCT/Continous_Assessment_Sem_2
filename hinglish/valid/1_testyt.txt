 The philosophy of Emanuel Kant, is called "critical philosophy", "altruism", or "altruism suffragism"
 is darshan main gyaanashktiyon kii samiksha prastut kii gai he
 Also, there is a review of the 17th and 18th centuries of intellectualism and rationalism
 vichaarsaamagree ke arjan main idriyon kii madhyamikta kii sweekruti main kaant indriyavaadiyon se sahamat tha; ukt saamagree ko vichaaron main parinat karne main buddhi kii anivaaryta kaa samarthan karne main vah buddhivaadiyon se sahamat tha; kintu vah ek kaa niraakaran kar duusare kaa samarthan karne main kisi se sahamat na tha
 In Kant's opinion, intellect and senses are not two separate institutions of knowledge, but two different components of the same body
 kaant ke darshan ko "paratavaad" kehane kaa aashay use indriyavaad tathaa buddhivaad se "par" tathaa prayek darshanik vivechan ke liye aadharbhoot maananaa he
 In his philosophy, the intellect itself has been tested and not in a subject known and very vivid
 europea darshan ke vistrut itihaas main, pratham or antim baar, kaant ke madhyam se, gyaanashktiyon ne swayan kii vyakhya itane vistaar se prastut kii he
 The first directive of this type of interpretation was received from Socrates in Greek philosophy
 usne kaha tha: "apane aapako jaano", kintu uske baad apane aapako jaanane ke jitne praytn kiye gaye sabakaa paryavsaan apane se bahm vastuon ke gyaan main hi hota rahaa
 At the beginning of the modern period, the French thinker Dekart again said forcefully - senses are not worthy of belief, they cause confusion; Wisdom is also not worthy of absolute belief, it proves untrue decisions; But "I think, therefore i am", is a belief whose every refutation proves its truth
 par, kisi vichaarak ne us gyaanadhikaran "main", athwa buddhi ke jatil santhaan kii chaanbin nahin kii
 The trends of the era were beset by the influences of mathematics and physics
 ticobrahi or kopernicus ne ganit ke sahare sadaa se sansar ke centre main baithi hui prithvi ko dhakelkar uske sthaan par surya ko baitha diya tha
 The Galileans, on the other hand, had researched the twofold motion of the earth, dropping stones from the top of the tilted column of Pisa
 europea vichaarak inhen donon prabhaavon ke antargat do dalon main bantkar, gyansamrajya par buddhi athwa indriyon ke ekadhikaar kaa samarthan kar rahe the
 On the one hand, the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm was a follower of the Leibnitz, on the other, a supporter of the British thinker John Locke
 kintu, yug kii dasha dekhakar scotland ke ndehwaadee kahe janevaale vichaarak david hum ne phir poocha, kaaranta ke samarthan kaa aadhaar kahan he? ghatnaon ke jaal main keval purvapar sambandh, sahagaman aadi ke atirikt kuch bhi pratyaksh kaa vishay nahin he
 This time, Kant's talent woke up and he began testing intelligence
 1770 i
 se 1781 i
 tak usne shuddh buddhi ke kaaryon par chintan kar, "critic der rinen vernunfat" ke madhyam se ghoshit kiya ki shuddh buddhi andrik pradatton kaa sanshleshan karti hai
 That is why two types of elements are available to intellectualize and at the subtle analysis of every scientific decision
 ukt samiksha ke pratham bhaag main usne andrik bodh kaa vivechan karte hue, indriyon dwaara bahya jagat se laai hui saamagree or uske bodh ke swabhaav main, samavisht rup main, antar kiya
 He explained that the effect that external objects have on the senses is free from passages of country and time, but, sensory perception is not possible without these passages
 is prakaar usne nirnit kiya ki ye bodh ke do rup hai, jinhen prayek bodhsamagree ko indriyadvaron main pravesh karte hi grahan karnaa padataa he
 Kant called the primordial element, stabilizing the country and time in an inverted shape
 bahya jagat se ai hui saamagree main itnaa roopaantar ho chukne par buddhi kaa doosraa vibhaag, arthbodhvibhag apana kaam prarambh karata he
 The functions of this department are discussed in the second part of the Intelligence Review, "on Analysis"
 vah desh or kalbodh se yukt saamagree par 12 oopaadhiyon kaa aarope karata he
 Kant divided the 12 titles of Arthabodha into four groups
 ekta, bahuta or samshti kii oopaadhiyaan parimansuchak hai; satta, nishedh or sasimta kii oopaadhiyaan gunasuchak hai; vyapti-adhi-kritatv, kaaranta nirbharta or samuhikta sambandhsuchak hai; sambhaavna asambhaavna, astitv anstitv, anivaaryta aakasmikta prakaarta kaa bodh karaati hai
 There are 12 types of intellectual judgments available as a result of the charge of the above 12 titles - general, specific and unanimous are judgments of magnitude, confessional, injunctive and asymptotic decisions make merits; Absolute, relative and alternative relationships make sense of problematic, descriptive and skeptical decisions
 is prakaar kaant ne sthir kiya ki bahya jagat kaa gyaan praapt karne main buddhi andrik saamagree main itnaa roopaantar kar detii he ki indriyadvaron main pravisht hone ke pashchaat jagat kaa rup pehle jaisaa nahin rah jaataa
 Therefore, he had to distinguish between the intellectual object and the external object
 buddhi ke anushaasan se mukti vastu kii usne "newmena" or ukt anushaasan main jakadi hui vastu kaa "fenomena" sangya di
 This difference was meant to show that after the intellectual transformation, the true known object becomes destructive
 ab tisare bhaag main, jise usne "paradwaitiki" sheershak diya tha, usne bataaya ki indriyon kii sahakaarita ke abhaav main saadhanheen shuddh buddhi ishwar, aatma tathaa vishwasamshti kaa gyaan praapt karne main asamarth he
 However, Kant's aim was not to enforce "ignorance" by proving the intellect incompetent in the knowledge of the above subjects
 atev kaant ne saat varsh apane shuddh buddhi kii samiksha ke antim nirnay par athak chintan kiya
 At last, he saw the path of wisdom to move forward
 falat: san 1788 i
 main, usne duusari samikshapustak prakashit kii
 This was a "review of practical intelligence"
 saat varsh purv shuddh ke liye aatma, paramatma or vishwasamshti ke jo agam kshetra the, unamem vyaavhaarik buddhi ne, naitik anubhav kaa pathey lekar, pravesh kiya
 Kant's practical intelligence was not limited to the external nature and to the laws of his nature, just like the pure intellect
 vah swatantra bauddhik vyakti kii buddhi thi, jo swatan: apana niyaman karne main samarth thi
 This does not mean that Kant wanted to support Habs's individualism with the theory of practical intelligence
 usne vyaavhaarik buddhi ko swashaasan kii swatantraaa pradaan kii thi, kintu aise niyamon ke anusaar, jinka anusaran vishwa maanav ke liye uchit ho
 To understand this level of Kant's philosophy, there is a need to understand the difference between charitableness and behavior on the one hand and the distinction between theoretical and moral intelligence on the other
 vah parmarth ko gyanatmak vyapaar kii paridhi se "par" maanata tha, isiilie saidhantik chintan kii samiksha prastut, jo satya he, "vyavhaar" main, jo praatibhasik he, parinat ho jaataa he
 However, in his view moral thinking is far from theoretical thinking; Because he is free from doctrinal restrictions
 isliye, naitik chintan un vishyon tak pahunch saktaa he jo saidhantik chintan ke liye duruh hai
 What Kant calls practical intelligence is literally moral intelligence, the intellectual human's free will power
 isi prasang main kaant ne aatma ke amartv kii or ishwar ke astitv kii pun: sthapana kii he
 Theoretical thinking can do its work without these existence, but without their imagination, the feet of moral thought cannot be set
 amar aatma kii sweekruti main shaashvat jivan kii sweekruti he; ishwar kii sweekruti karmfaladaata kii sweekruti he
 They may not have any theoretical value, but moral value is very big
 naitik chintan main buddhi kaa kaary aacharan kii samasya par vichaar karnaa he
 That is why Kant called it practical intelligence
 kintu vah anek buddhiyon kaa samarthan nahin kar rahaa tha
 He wanted to show that by discrimination, intelligence develops in different ways, acting according to different rules
 prakruti ke vaigyanik vivechan main vah indriyon kii sahakaarita kii apeksha karti he or apane 14 niyamon kaa prayog karti he
 There she does not support any power that cannot come under the discipline of her 14 contracts
 naitik chintan main pravrutt hote hi vah sankalp kaa rup le leti he or karm kaa poshan karanevaali sattaaon main vishwaas karti he
 Kant's third problem was the representation of the activity of the intellect in the taste of "beautiful"
 vah kaary karne ke liye usne "nirnay kii samiksha" prastut kii
 The time of its coming to light was 1790 AD
 kaant ke anusaar "sundar" kii ore unmukh hote hi buddhi "nirnay" kaa rup le leti he
 He considered "judgment" to be the link between pure intelligence and practical intelligence
 usne prakruti ko shuddh buddhi kaa vishay tehraaya tha or prakruti ke satya kaa avagaahan evam anivaaryta kaa anusandhan uddeshy bataaya tha
 The theme of practical intelligence or resolve was "auspicious" and the experience of freedom
 ab vah nirnay kaa vishay rasanubhuti bataata he or is anubhuti ko anivaaryta tathaa swatantraaa ke madhya kii sthiti maanata he
 Apparently in the decision he wanted to combine reality and ideal
 uske vichaar ko samajhane ke liye hamen sundar sambandhi kalpana ko gyaan or sankalp ke bich rakhana hoga
 He considered "beauty" not merely an object of knowledge, but a pleasant thing, but the pleasure that arises from the observation of "beauty" was considered contagious
 usne "sundar" kii paribhaasha main gun, pariman or prakaarta kaa samavesh tathaa sambandh kaa nishedh kiya he
 This type of recovery is not possible without pure intelligence and moral conduct
 isiilie, vah "sundar" kii kalpana ko gyaan or sankalp ke bich kaa nirnay kahata he
 This modern review of Kant did not have as much influence as any modern opinion had on the later ideologies
 uske swatantraaa ke vichaar ne ficte, shelling or hegel ko prabhavit kiya
 Kant's elucidation of the known and known object influenced Schopenhaar
 loje kaa prayojanamulak pratyaywad kaant ke hi darshan kaa fal tha
 Lang, Simel and Waihinger developed their opinions about his psychological and behavioral views
 kohen, natrop, rikirt, haseral, hidagar, casirer kii aalochana paddatiyaan kaant ke hi sanketon par aadhaarit hai
 British thinkers Caird, Green, and Bradley assimilated Kant's influence through Hegel

 X-ray crystallography is a commonly used method for determining antibody structures
 haalanki, ek pratipind ko crystallise karnaa aksar kathin or lambaa kaam hota he
 Computational approaches may provide a cheaper alternative to crystallography, but the results are mostly unclear because they do not produce empirical structures
 Online web servers, such as web antibody modeling and prediction of immunoglobulin structures, make computational modeling of antibody volatile regions possible

 The term "antibody" is first mentioned in Paul Ihrlich's article
 anticorper shabd, oktober 1891 main prakashit uske lekh "experimental studies on immunity" ke ant main prakat hota he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki "yadi do padaarth do vibhinn anticorper ko badhaava dete hai, to ve aapas main avashya hi alag alag hone chahien"

 haalanki, shabd ko turant hi sweekaar nahin kiya gaya or antibody ke liye kai duusare shabd prastaavit kiye gayi, jiname immunecorper, emboceptor, vishencorper, sabstans sensibilysetris, kopula, desmone, philocietes, phiksechar tathaa immunism jaise shabd shaamil the
 The term antibody is formally similar to the term antitoxin and has the same concept as immunocorpor
 antibody ke adhyayan kii shuruyaat 1890 main hui, jab emil won behring or shibasaburo kitasato ne dipthiria or tetanus ke vish ke khilaaf pratipind kii prakriya kaa varnan kiya
 Behring and Kitasato introduced the theory of physiological immunity by saying that mediators in the serum can react with external antigens
 unke vichaar ne 1897 main paul iharlish ko pratipind or pratijan ke liye paksh shrinkhalaa siddhant pesh karne ke liye prerit kiya, jab unhonen dharna vyakt kii ki koshikaon kii sataha par receptors, "lock-and-kii" kriya dwaara vishakt padaarthon ko vishesh tareeke se baandh sakate the - or yah badhyakaari kriya pratipindon ke utpaadan kii mukhya vajah thi
 Other researchers believed that antibodies were found independently in the blood, and in 1904, Elmroth Wright reported that soluble antibodies had coated bacteria to kill and cause phagocytosis; a process he called Osponization
 1920 ke dashak main, maaikel hidelaburger or oswald evari ne paaya ki pratijanon ko pratipindon dwaara alag kiya ja saktaa tha or dikhaaya ki pratipind protein ke bane the

 Together, these scientists discovered the structure of igg and the entire amino acid sequence, a feat for which they jointly received the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
 While most early studies focused on igm and igg, a second immunoglobulin isotype was identified in the 1960s: Thomas Tomasi discovered the secretory antibody iga and David Rowe and John Fahey identified igd, and ige identified allergic reactions
 a class of antibodies included in Kikishige Ishizaka and Teruki Ishizaka

 One has to imagine the time when computers were the size of a house or a stadium
 in computaron ke aakaar ke saath to ghanghor pareshaani thi hi
 Even more difficult was that every computer had a different operating system
 software aksar faramaaishi hote the or zaruri nahin ki ek tantra par chalanevaala software kisi or par chal jaae
 That is, working on a system did not mean that you would be able to work on the rest as well
 yah prayoktaaon or prabandhakon donon ke liye sirdard tha
 Computers were also very expensive then, and after making the original purchase, it required considerable sacrifice to learn how to work on it
 soochna praudyogiki par kul laagat kamartod hoti thi
 Since there were no technological developments, people had to spend a decade with heavy and expensive machines
 In 1969, a team of developers in Bell Labs' lab began to work on the issue of software interoperability
 unhone ek nae prachaalan tantra kaa nirmaan kiya jo: Belllabs developers called the project 'unix'
 isaki code-nakal pranali ahm isliye thi, kyonki tab tak tamaam vyavsaayik prachaalan tantra khaas tantra ke khaas code main hi likhe jate the
 On the other hand, Unix needed a small piece of code that is commonly called kernel nowadays
 unix kaa aadhaar banane vaale is karnel ko har computer tantra main thodi pher-badal ke saath lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 All the processes including the operating system were built around this kernel written in the developed programming language i

 'C'
 yah bhashaa khaas taur par unix tantra ke nirmaan ke liye rachi gai thi
 Using this new technology, it became easier to develop operating systems running on different hardware
 software vikritaon ne isko foran apana liya, kyonki ab ve bade aaraam se das guna zayaada bikri karne kii sthiti main the
 Bizarre situations began to occur: computers purchased from different vendors started talking among themselves in the same network, or people working on different types of machines started switching machines without any additional education
 agle do dashak bhar unix kaa vikaas hota rahaa
 Many things became possible and software vendors added new things to Unix in their products
 shuru main unix vishalkay maahaul main menfrem or mini-computer ke saath hi dikhte the 
 The opportunity to put hands on Unix was available only to those working in a university or a big business house
 lekin chote computer bhi banane lage the or 80 ke dashak ke ant tak kai logon ke paas gharelu computer aa gaye the
 By that time there were many versions of Unix for PC, but none of them were free
 linas or linaks Linus Torvald, studying computer at the University of Helsinki, felt that there should be a free academic version of Unix and immediately started writing code
 usne apane nijee computer par unix lagane ke jugad main madadgaar sawaal poochne or samaadhaan dhundne shuru kiye

 What to say if you find an FTP site!) --- shuruyaat se hi linas kii manshaa thi ki koi aisa mukt tantra ho jo mul unix ke anukool ho
 That is why he demanded the Posix Standard because Posix was the standard of Unix
 tab tak plag-or-play kaa avishkaar hua nahin tha
 But this was a minor hurdle in the face of the ever increasing demand for private Unix
 nae hardweyaron ke liye lagaataar or badi tezi se nae driver banaae ja rahe the
 As soon as a new hardware comes in the market, someone will buy it and do its 'linus-test'

 The business of these coders was not limited to personal computers, but they used to write code for all that was available for Linux
 us jamaane main in logon ko "nard" yaa "freek" kaha jaataa tha, lekin isse inhen koi farq nahin padataa tha kyonki samarthit hardweyaron kii suchi to lambii hoti ja rahi thi
 The result of the efforts of these people is that today Linux has not only become the ideal system for pcs, but if Linux had not been there, then the old and very dear hardware would have fallen into the dustbin of history
 linas ke ullikhit patr ke do saal baad 12000 linaks upayokta the
 Initially, the project was an amateur pastime, but it gradually expanded, even if it was within the periphery of the Posix standard

 In the late 18th century, a philosopher named D
 Trouille, describing the meteorite that fell at the location of Alberto in Italy, conceived the idea that it must have come in the form of a star bursting from the mantle, but no one paid attention to it
 san 1768 i
 main fadar basile ne france main luus naamak sthaan par ek ulkapind ko prithvi par aate hue swat: dekha
 The following year he read an article on this account in the session of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris

 Later, the German philosopher Claudney, studying a meteorite from Siberia in 1794, proposed the theory that the bodies are representative of the mantle
 yadhyapi is baar bhi yah vichaar turant sweekaar nahin kiya gaya, phir bhi cladni ko is prasang par dhyaan aakarshith karne kaa shrey mila or tab se vaigyanik is vishay par adhik manoyog dene lage
 In 1803, there was a huge rainstorm of meteorites at La Aigil location in France, in which countless small and big stones fell and often two or three thousand of them could be collected
 vigyaan kii francisi academi ne us vrishti kii puri chaanbin kii or ant main kisi ko bhi yah andeh nahin rahaa ki ulkapind vastut: khamandal se hi prithvi par aate hai
 The main classification of meteorites is based on their organization
 kuch pind adhikanshat: lohe, nikal yaa mishradhaatuon se bane hote hai or kuch silicket khanijon se bane pathar sadrush hote hai
 The first class is called metallic and the second class is called meteoric meteorite
 iske atirikt kuch pindon main dhatvik or aashmik padaarth praaia: samaan maatra main paae jate hai, unhen dhatvashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In fact, meteorites of all kinds of intercastes are found between completely metallic and completely wondrous invertebrates, which often makes it difficult to decide the class of bodies
 sanrachana ke aadhaar par teenon virgo main upbhed kiye jate hai
 There are two main strains in the heavenly bodies, one is called chondrite and the other is acoundrite
 pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa mukhya lakshan yah he ki unamem kuch vishisht vrittakar dane, jinhen kaundrul kehete hai, upasthit rahete hai
 Ponds in which the tendrils are not present are called achondrites
 dhatvik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upbhed hai jinhen kramash: ashtani or shashthanik kehete hai
 These names express the inner structure of the bodies and, as these names express, the bonds of metallic material in the first differential objects are configured in the octagonal shape and in the second in the crystalline shape
 is prakaar kii rachana ko vidamanstator kehete hai evam yah pindon ke marjeet prishth par badi sugamawa se pahachaani ja sakati he
 There are also two main subclasses in the metaphysical meteorites, which are called palacite and semi-metaphysical

 Semi-metallic meteorites mainly contain pyroxene and small amounts of anorthite feldspars
 purv prakaran main yah ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki dhatvik or aashmik angon kii pradhanta ke aadhaar par ulkapind vargeekrut kiye jate hai
 But there does not seem to be any definite basis for the distribution of chemical elements and minerals in these bodies
 ulkapindon ke teen mukhya virgon ke atirikt anekanek upvarg hai jinamein se prayek kaa apana pruthak vishesh khanij samudaay he
 So far, 25 new classes have been detected and often one new subclass is being detected every two years
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki adhyayan ke liye uplabdh padaarth atyant alp maatra main hote hai
 So far the presence of only 52 chemical elements in meteorites has been certified, whose names are as follows: 
 Oxygen
 gandhak
 Platinum

 argon gallium
 Phosphorus vung arsenic jarmenium barium vanadium Indium zirconium beryllium
 silicon

 The remaining 24 elements are present in very small quantities and their presence has been proved by spectral analysis
 khanij sanrachana kii drushti se ulkapindon or prithvi main pai gai shail raashiyon ke lakshanon main kai antar hote hai
 Generally, iron and nickel are very rare in independent metallic forms in global rock deposits, but in meteorites, metals are found in abundance in pure form, and often indispensably
 iske atirikt kai aise khanij hai jo bhumadleey shailon main nahin paae jate, par ulkapindon main milte hai
 Chief among these are Oldemite and Schreiberite
 ye donon khanij nami or oxigen kii bahulata main sthaayee nahin hote or isi kaaran bhumandaleey shailon main nahin milte
 Their presence suggests that the meteorites originated in an environment where the conditions of oxidation were lower than on the planet

 The subject of the origin of meteorites is very controversial
 is vishay par anek mat samay samay par prastaavit hue hai, jinamein se kuch main inhen prithvi, chandramaa, surya or dhoomaketu aadi kaa ansh mana gaya he
 According to a very popular belief, they originated from a planet which is completely destroyed now
 is vichaar main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki aadi main praaia: mangal ke aakaar kaa ek grah rahaa hoga jo kisi duusare bade grah ke atyant sameep aa jane par, athwa kisi duusare grah se takaraakar, vinasht ho gaya, jisase arabon kii sankhya main chote bade khand bane jo ulka rup main khamandal main vichar rahe hai
 According to this view, the metallic meteors represent the central part of the fictitious planet and the astounding meteors represent the upper surface
 yadhyapi is upakalpana se ulkapindon ke anek lakshanon kii vyakhya ho jaati he, phir bhi anek baaten anbujhi paheli rah jaati hai
 For example, some metallic meteorites have an octahedral structure that is usually destroyed at 800 ° C
 aisa vishwaas he ki us kalpit grah ke vikhandan ke samay avashya hi usamen adhik taap utpann hua hoga
 Still, it is not understood how this octagonal composition survived
 isi prakaar yah shankaa bhi bani rahati he ki akundrite aashmik ulka main loha kahan se aayaa or kaundrite aashmik ulka main kaunduul kaise bane
 In another opinion, it has been proposed that meteorites originated with the planets, or rather, that the solar system and all cosmic matter originated from meteorites
 is kalpana ke anusaar aadi vishwa ulkapindon se paripurna tha ev kalantar main ve pind vibhinn punjon main ekatrit hote gaye tathaa unke adhikadhik ghanikaran ke krmanusaar gasamay noharika, nakshatra evam grah utpann hue
 a major error of this imagination seems to be that meteorites present in the mantle are so dispersed and their mutual attraction is so weak that it will take too much time to collect and form a large amount
 kintu isamen koi andeh nahin ki ek baar paryaapt bade aakaar kii raashi ban jane ke baad vah apni satta banaae rakh sakegaa or kalantar main or adhik pindon ko apane main milakar apane aakaar kii vruddhi bhi kar sakegaa
 It is possible to partially modify the above methods to determine their actual method of origin

 The term plant pathology or phytopathology derives from three Greek words such as plant, disease and knowledge, which literally means "knowledge of plant diseases"
 at: padap rogavigyaan, krishi vigyaan, vanaspati vigyaan yaa jeev vigyaan kii vah shakha he, jiske antargat rogon ke lakshno, kaarnon, hetu kii, rogachakra, raagon se haani evam unke niyantran kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa hai
 This science has the following major objectives: padap rog vigyaan ek vyaavhaarik vigyaan he, jiske antargat paudh rog ke kaarak evam unke praayogic samaadhaan aate he
 Since the disease in the plant is caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, mycoplasma, nematodes, flowers etc
 besides other inanimate causes like poisonous gases etc
 at: padap rog vigyaan kaa sambandh anya vigyaan jaise kavak vigyaan, jeevanu vigyaan, micoplasma vigyaan, sookshm jeev vigyaan, sutara-krimi vigyaan, sasy daihiki, anuvaanshiki evam krishi rasayan vigyaan se sambandhit he
 Ever since humans started farming on the earth, plant diseases have also been occurring on crops since that time
 pracheen dharmagranthon jaise - veda evam bible aadi main bhi padap rogon dwaara hone vaale fasalon ke vinaash ke anek varnan milte hai
 The importance of plant diseases has increased greatly due to the losses caused by them
 rogon dwaara haani khet se bhandaran tak athwa beej bone se lekar fasal kaatane ke bich kisi bhi samay ho sakati he paudhe ke jivan kaal main beej sadan, ardramaari, balpaudh jhulasa, tana sadan, parnjhulasa, parn-daag, pushp jhulasa tathaa fal sadan byaadhio utpann hoti he
 Although the damage caused by plant diseases in India has not been accurately assessed
 parantu anusandhan dwaara kuch bheeshan bimaariyaan jaise dhan ko jhonka evam bhura parndaag, gehun kaa karnal bant tathaa aalu ke pichheta jhulasa ke ugr vistaar se sambandhit vibhinn karkon ko adhyayan kar purvanumaan model viksit kiya gaya he
 Due to many devastating diseases of crops, the yield of crops is directly or indirectly high every year
 in raagon ke mukhya udaahaaran - When various types of fungi attack the stored grains, along with their decimation, some toxins are produced in them which cause diseases of humans and animals, hysteria, paralysis, stomach pain etc
 padap rogon ke niyantran par jo rupaya vyay kiya jaataa he vah bhi ek prakaar kii haani hi he or yadi is rupaye ko duusare krishi kaaryon main lagaaya jaye to utpaadan or bhi adhik badhaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, due to low production caused by plant diseases, factories based on them also face difficulty which depends on the raw materials produced in agriculture such as cotton, oilseeds, sugarcane, jute etc
 kachche maal main kami ke kaaran yatayaat udyog bhi prabhavit hota he

 electraniki vigyaan kaa vah vibhaag he jisamen electron naliyon kaa athwa usee tarah kaa kaary karne vaale ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti ko vaanchit voltata, aavriti, dhara main dakshatapurvak badla jaataa he
 The fact is that electric power is used very rarely in the form we receive
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi udyog ko vidyut shakti 415 volt, 50 hertz asi ke rup main milti he
 It has to be electrocuted for which 0 to 20 volts DC is required, from which zero to 1200 ampere current will flow
 spasht he ki hamen jo vidyut praapt ho rahi he use sidhe is kaary ke liye upyog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa, balki use badalanaa padegaa
 This work is done by Shakti Electronics
 vastav main aise hajaaron udhaaharan hai jahaan vidyut shakti ko jyon kaa tyon upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa balki kisi duusare rup main badalanaa padataa he
 Important uses of electronic devices are: aajkal ke kai atiprachlit yantra bhi bina electraniki ke ban nahin pate, jaise radio, doordarshan, chalchitr, pratidipti prakaash, jan-vyaakhyaan-pranali, telephone aadi
 All these tips are the result of electronics
 electraniki ke kuch audyogic upyogon ke vishay main sankshep main neeche likh ja rahaa he : Inductors are often used in industries, by which the alternating current is converted into a specified current
 ve praaia: nimnlikhit main se ek prakaar ke hote hai : The use of multicomponent circuitous circuits in high power compensation is more profitable for several reasons than neglecting the use of single circuitry circuits
 pratham kaaran yah he ki aajkal vidyutiya shakti kaa utpaadan tathaa vitaran tri-kala-shakti ke rup main hota he
 The second reason is that the voltage generated by the polynomial bifurcation is more even than the voltage produced by the single bifurcation
 uparyukt ucchashakti rujukari main yaa to anek dhanagron ke liye ek hi runagra rahata he yaa anek dhanagar rujukari, jinke runagra jude rahete hai, prayog main laae jate hai
 Both types of minuscule are used
 motor kii chaal kaa niyantran kaagaj ke milon main vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he, kyonki chaal par hi kaagaj kii motaai nirbhar rahati he
 In these devices, the electric current of the field of exciter is changed, which produces the controlling area for the generator
 yah janitr ek prime mover dwaara chaalit hota he
 The armature of the generator gives its output to the motor whose speed has to be controlled
 ek dashti-dhara-janitr is motor dwaara chalaaya jaataa he; vah apni chaal ke samaanupaat main voltata utpann karata he
 If that voltage is different from predetermined voltage then it activates a regulator
 yah niamak iksiter ke kshetra main aisa parivartan laa detaa he ki motor kii chaalu purvanishchit maan par aa jaae
 Many tubes are used in this regulator
 is prakaar electraniki kii sahaayta se motor kii chaal kaa niyantran atisookshm maan tak kiya ja saktaa he
 Industrial Uses of High Frequency Heating - Extremely powerful high frequency generators are being used a lot in heating by cross electrification and motivation
