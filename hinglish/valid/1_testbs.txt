 — SONAL CHAUHAN (@sonalchauhan7)april 18, 2019 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that it is the responsibility of the judiciary to protect secularism
 saath hi unhone suraksha balon se aagrah kiya ki unhen dharmik apilon se dur rahanaa chahie
 Describing secularism as the fundamental form of the constitution, he has said, 'first of all, it is very important for the judiciary as an institution not to ignore its primary responsibility to preserve the nature of secularism enshrined in the constitution
 'dharmanirpekshata kii raksha nyaaypalika kii jimmedaaridow
 Addressing comradeab Vardhansmriti Vyakhan on Tuesday, Singh said, "the demand to fulfill the objective of preserving the secular form of the constitution has become even more urgent in the current era than before
 raajnneetik virodh or chunavi muqablon main dharmik tatwon, pratikon, mithkon or purvagrahon kii maujuudagi bhi kaaphi adhik bad gai he
 'dr
 singh ne kaha ki sainya balon ko bhi dharmik apilon se khud ko achoota rakhane kii jarurat he
 He said that the Indian armed forces are an integral part of the country's great secular form
 isliye yah behad jaruri he ki sashastr bal swayan ko sampradayik apilon se achoota rakhen
 Addressing the second AB Bardhan lecture organized by CPI on 'secularism and Defense of Democracy', the former PM said, 'we must undoubtedly understand that any attempt to undermine the secular nature of our republic is broadly based on equal rights thinking Will destroy restoration efforts
 ' unhone kaha ki in prayaason kii kamyaabi sabhi sanvaidhanik sansthaaon main nihit he
 Referring to the Babri Masjid case, the former Prime Minister said that the quarrel between the political parties and politicians in the early 1990s over the co-existence of majority and minorities has reached an untimely level
 unhone kaha 'babari masjid par rajanetaaon kaa jhagade kaa ant ucchtam nyaayalay main hua or nyaayadhishon ko samvidhan ke dharmanirpeksh swaroop ko pun: paribhaashit kar behaal karnaa padaa
 Babri Masjid demolition traumatic event singh ne babari masjid dhwans ko dardanaak ghatana bataaya
 He said, 'the day of six December 1992 was a sad day for our secular republic and it hurt our secular commitments
 ' unhone kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne es aar bommai maamle main dharmanirpekshata ko samvidhan ke moulik swaroop kaa hissaa bataaya
 The Congress leader said that unfortunately this satisfactory situation was sustained for a short time, shortly after the Bommai case, Justice JS Verma's famous but disputed verdict, describing 'hindutva as a lifestyle', arrived
 isse ganatantric vyavastha main dharmanirpeksh siddhanton ke bare main raajnneetik dalon ke bich chal rahi bahes par nirnaayak asar hua
 He said that no constitutional system can be protected only by the judiciary, despite the vigilance and intellectual abilities of the judges
 antim taur par samvidhan or isaki dharmanirpeksh patibaddhtaon ke sangrakshan kii jimmedaari raajnneetik netritv, naagarik samaaj, dharmik netaaon or prabud varg kii he
 Dr
 singh ne aagaah kiya ki asamanta or bhedbhaav kii sadiyon puraani roodhiyon vaale is desh main dharmanirpekshata ke sangrakshan kaa lakshya hasil karnaa aasaan nahin he
 He said that ultimately, religion is not the only basis of social discrimination
 kabhi kabhi jati, bhashaa or ling ke aadhaar par haashiye par pahunche asahaay log hinsa, bhedbhaav or anyaay kaa shikaar ho jate hai

 There is perfection in imperfection and that is the beauty and the challenge of this human life

 '' After the defeat in the elections in three states, Yogi Adityanath is also on the target of opponents, someone is blaming him for calling him the caste of Bajrang Bali, and someone is abusing him for comments Ali and Bajrangbali, but these three elections The figures are telling a different story
 aankadon kii baat karen to vidhayakon ko jitaane vaale vaale star prachaarkon main yogi adityanath kaa strike rate sabase zyada rahaa
 Yogi Adityanath won 69 percent of his candidates, in whose favor he campaigned
 chaar rajyon main yogi adityanath ne kul 74 sabhaayen ,alag-alag vidhansabhaon main kii or in 74 main se 51 siton par bijepi ko jeet mili
 Yogi Adityanath's performance was the most outstanding in terms of strike rate
 bataa den ki chhattisgarh main buree haar ke baavjood bijepi ke jite 17 siton main 8 aisi seat he jahaan yogi adityanath ne chunaav prachaar kiya tha
 That is, even in Chhattisgarh, Yogi took more than 50 percent of his campaign seats
 26 vidhansabha main kiye chunaav prachaar main 25 ummidavaar jiteyogi adityanath kaa sabase shandaar record rajasthan kaa rahaa jahaan yogi adityanath kii 26 vidhansabha main kiye chunaav prachaar main 25 ummidavaar jeet gaye
 In Madhya Pradesh too, Yogi managed to win 17 candidates, in whose favor he campaigned
 in chunaav ke nateezon ke baad virdohi jahaan yogi ko haar kii jimmedaari thope rahe hai
 At the same time, Yogi's supporters are considering him as the face of the future
 bataa den yogi ke strike rate se waakif in rajyon ke kai netaa sidhe apane chunaav kshetra main inaki sabhaayen chaahate the lekin yogi adityanath ke kareebi sutron kii maane to yogi adityanath bijepi haikaman ke diye nirdeshon ke mutabik hi apni raajnneetik sabhaayen karte rahe, kabhi yogi ne apni pasand nahin tay kii na hi kabhi sabhaaon se manaa kiya
 This is the reason that despite infection and swelling in the eyes, Yogi Adityanath kept on holding four meetings a day with black glasses
 firebrands hindutv kaa chehrabijepi pravaktaa dow
 Chandramohan says that Yogi Adityanath's firebrand face of Hindutva is not just the secret of his success, but the reverence associated with Gorakhnath Math and his followers across the country also make Yogi Adityanath different from other regional satraps
 yahi vajah he kai mukhyamantri bhi unke prati aadar or shraddha kaa bhav saarvajanik rup se saamne rakhane se nahin hichakate

 is video main major general bakshi ne daawa kiya he ki srinagar main ek firing haadase ke baad sena ko na sirf maafee maangani padi thi balki purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne yah sunishchit kiya tha ki is haadase main shaamil javaanon ko tihaad bheja jaae
 An investigation by the India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) revealed that there were many flaws in General Bakshi's claim
 is ghatana main shaamil kisi bhi jawan ko kabhi tihaad jail nahin bheja gaya tha
 General Bakshi made this claim in a TV show
 ise puducheri kii leftinent governor kiran bedi ne apane aadhikarik twitor acount se share bhi kiya

 com / ic8djq1a7b — Kiran Bedi (@thekiranbedi) February 17, 2019 BJP leader Subrahmanyam Swamy also claimed that "prosecutions against several army personnel went on and many are still in jail
" ”who authorised the prosecution of our army jawans who in 2014 shot at a Maruti car which smashed through three check points without stopping? That person is responsible for this latest SUV to get near the convoy killing 37 CRPF jawans
 The army jawans are still in jail — Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) February 16, 2019 General Bakshi said during a TV show, “during the tenure of Mehbooba Mufti, three army check posts were placed outside Srinagar
 ek din ek kashmiri sajjan aae or unhen bada gussa aayaa ki unhen roka kyon ja rahaa he? gusse main unhone pehla barier tod diya, phir doosraa barier bhi tod diya jabaki unhen chetavanee di ja rahi thi
 When he did not stop even after stopping, the soldier opened fire and died
 is ghatana ke baad bavaal khadaa ho gaya
 Mehbooba Mufti ensured that the jawan who opened fire is in Tihar Jail today and the then Commander General was General Hooda Saheb
 unhen saarvajanik rup se maafee maangani padi or wo saare barier hataa liye gaye
 "there are two factual mistakes in General Bakshi's claim here
 general bakshi or subrahmanyam swami jis ghatana kaa zikr kar rahe hai vah ghatana 3 november 2014 ko badgam jile ke chhatargam ilaake main hui thi
 According to the news published in the Indian Express newspaper, around 5
15 pm, five boys were going from Chhatargam to Naugam on the main road when 53 Rashtriya Rifles personnel fired on their car
 is firing main do ladakon kii maut ho gai
 The army and police also recorded separate statements of eyewitnesses of the incident as to what happened after which the barricade had to be fired
 lekin general bakshi ne yah tathy galat bataaya ki us vakt mahabuuba kii sarkaar thi
 The truth is that in November 2014, Omar Abdullah was then the Chief Minister of Jammu Kashmir and not Mehbooba Mufti
 april 2015 main pidipi kii sarkaar bani or mufti mohammad said mukhyamantri bane, unki mrityu ke baad april 2016 main mahabuuba ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 The incident that is being referred to was followed by tremendous protests and violence against the army throughout the valley
 is maamle main chadura thane main ek exiaar ( nan 231 / 14) darj kii gai
 The Army admitted that 53 Rashtriya Rifles personnel were at fault in the incident
 media reports ke mutabik nau javaanon ke khilaaf court of enquairi ke aadesh die gaye the
 However, there is no mention that the soldiers were punished in this case and sent to Tihar
 is baar main ek vistrut report da quint main bhi chhapi jisamen kaha gaya ki tatkaaleen leftinent general dies hooda ne saaf kiya kijawaanon ke court marshall kii khabaren juthi hai
 The army also confirmed to India Today that the soldiers were never sent to jail
 jab hamane general bakshi se unke daawey ke bare main poocha to unhone mana ki phogiyon ke ab bhi jail main hone kii baat galat he, haalanki unhone is baat par jor diya ki ghati main suraksha jaanch ke niyamon main dheel dene ke peeche pidipi sarkaar hi jimmedaar he

 Through her hard work, Maimuna Khatoon has made this government school the number one school in the area
 wo shiksha ke prati abhibhavakon ko jaagruk karne ke liye akele hi gaanv-gaanv gumti hai
 She convinces people to send children to school
 ye inti mehnat kaa hi nateeja he ki chote se kasbe ke skool main computer se lekarkhel-kud kii shikshadi ja rahi he
 Not only this, special attention is also paid to cultural activities
 wo bataati hai ki yah prerana unhen apni garibi ko dekhte hue mili kyonki jab wo in bacchon ke samaan thi tabhi unke upar se maa-baap kaa saaya uth gaya tha or unhone garibi se ladaai ladakar apane aap ko va puure parivaar ko shiksha dilaai
 Principal Maimuna Khatoon Kokai Award and citation from government officials have been received for this effort
 unka naam raashtrapati padak sammaan ke liye bhi gaya tha, lekin kisi kaaran se wo iske liye nahin chuni gai
 According to them, if teachers in government schools teach children diligently, then the schools in the village can also beat the convent school in the city
 naa ke baraabar hi media santhaan aise honge, jinka chhattisgarh main koi sthaayee pratinidhi hoga or vahaan ke halaat kii khabaren aap tak rose pahunchati hogi
 You must have seen a word on the TV screen after the Sukma attack
 Ground reporting, report from Ground Zero
 aam taur par laal rang se grount zero likhaa hota he
 Reporting is done from the ground zero where the reporting is zero
 ground zero kaa matlab kya hota he, iske liye hamane do dictionari kii madad lee, maiks webster or oxfort dictionari
 According to them, the surface on or just below which a nuclear explosion occurs is called ground zero
 jis jagah se koi gatividhi shuru hoti he yaa jis jagah par hoti he use ground zero kehete hai
 In 2001, New York's World Trade Tower was downed in a terrorist attack, called Ground Zero
 kai baar hamen khud se poochna chahie ki jis shabd kaa istamaal kar rahe hai, uskaa thik thik matlab jaanate bhi hai yaa nahin
 Often we do not know
 ham kaa matlab media se he
 You all know shabdon kaa zikr isliye kiya kyonki naksal hamale ke baad jin shabdon kaa istamaal ho rahaa he, use gaur se dekhiye
 After the Sukma attack, many channels have announced the elimination of the Naxalite problem, based on what facts and logic is surprising
 ise is tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he jaise antim kila yaa antim garh baaki rah gaya he jo sadak banane ke baad dhahne vaala he
 Is everything so easy that a journalist has come to know this through one day of ground reporting
 aap in baton kii parvaah na bhi karen to bhi aapkaa koi nuksaan nahin, kyonki iske baad bhi privet skool vaale manamaani fees lete rahenge or 800 kii jagah 2000 ke juute aapse kareedvaate rahenge
 After the Naxalite attack, we have again returned to the world of channels with emotional and passionate words
 jaise balidaan vyarth nahin jayega, naksali hamale kaa sher, jaanbaaj shoorveer, bharat maa kaa sapoot, The martyrs' family asked for revenge, when will they take revenge for the sacrifice, tell the date of revenge
 
 
 ham media waalon ke paas isse adhik na to samaj he or na hi koi doosraa tarika jisase ham chhattisgarh kii ghatnaon ko aap tak pahunchaa sake
 Now your training too has become such that there is neither time nor interest to understand beyond sacrifice, bravery and revenge
 bharat main do shabdon kii do samasyaayein hai
 Lakhs of army and paramilitary forces are behind these two problems of two words
 inke naam hai kashmir samasya or naksal samasya
 What are the reasons for the Naxal problem, what is happening now, where do people come from, where does the gun come from, where do they have military training to kill CRPF jawans, lay down landmines, Nobody knows all this
 kaha gaya ki notebandi ke kaaran aatankwaad or naksalwad kam ho gaya he
 All these things went public
 mere kehane kaa matlab sirf itnaa he ki na to ham tak yah baat pahunchati he ki itane saalon baad bhi naksali samasya kyon he or na hi yah baat ki ise dur karne ke liye kya nayaa kiya ja rahaa he
 The gun is the solution, so why is the gun taking so long
 zaahir he yah sab sunne samajhane ke liye vakt or dhiraj chahie jo na hamaare paas he or na aapke paas
 Therefore, such lines are bouncing on the TV screen that when the revenge will be taken, the sacrifice will not go in vain
 11 march ko bhi yahi sab kaha gaya tha jab sukama main hi naksaliyon ne siarpief par bada hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 The attack took place at 9
15 am when 112 CRPF personnel were on patrol
 sadak khaali kara rahe the
 More than 100 Naxalites attacked the soldiers and looted huge amount of weapons
 is hamale main siarpief ke 12 javaanon kii maut hui thi
 The media described the March 11 attack as the biggest Naxalite attack of 2017
 11 march ko bhi media ne likhaa ki siarpief ke paas sthaayee mukhiya nahin he, 24 april ke hamale ke baad bhi media ne kaha ki siarpief kaa sthaayee mukhiya kyon nahin he
 This question is fine, but being a permanent head does not attack or improve the situation, what is the guarantee? isi sukama main saat saal pehle naksaliyon ne 76 javaanon ko maar diya tha
 This time 25 soldiers have been killed
 bhavuk shabdon se agar insaaf miltaa yaa badla le liya jaataa to ye do shabdon kii do samasyaayein samaapt ho chuki hotin
 The media is also asking for the date of revenge of sacrifice
 tarikh poochne vaale se poocha ja saktaa he ki sab kuch balidaan yaa badla hi he yaa naksali samasya se ladane kii niti-ranneeti kii bhi kabhi samiksha hogi
 So much change has come that now after these attacks no one is asked to resign, no accountability is fixed
 sukama hamale ke vakt bhi pradhanmantri ne grahamantri se baat kii thi, halaat kaa gauge liya tha or grahamantri sukama gaye the
 The incident was condemned and even then it was said that the sacrifice of the soldiers would not go in vain
 tamaam ghatnaon kii reporting bhi sthaayee rup se netaaon kii pratikriya kii tarah hoti ja rahi he
 If the revenge is taken, will the Naxalite problem be solved and why the revenge will be taken of the incident of 24 April, will not the 12 soldiers killed on 11 March be avenged
 unka kyon nahin badla liya gaya
 All i am saying is that you are caught in the language that TV and politics have given you, you are stuck not only us
 ye bhram kii bhashaa he, jisase sirf dharna banati he, soochna or samiksha nahin hoti he
 Listen to the brave soldiers of CRPF
 phir sochiye kaise tamaam gashti, chusti ke baad 300 naksali aam adivasee janata ko dhaal banaakar saamne aa gaye or hamalaa kar diya
 That too during the day
 ek maheene ke bheetar yah duusari badi chook he
 The second major attack is
 ek maheene main hamaare 38 jawan shahid ho gaye hai
 Can we ask the question of the three hundred Naxalites who came in black veneer who looted weapons, killed the soldiers and what is visible in the media, their discarded clothes, water bottles and bullets kiosks
 ye naksali kahaan se itani badi sankhya main aa gaye or itane javaanon ko maar kar gaayab ho gaye
 Now why is there no talk of drone surveillance, satellite images
 hamale ke vakt hamaare jawan soochna takanic se las to honge hi, phir ham kyon nahin jaan pate hai ki javaanon par hamalaa karne vaale ye naksali itane safal kaise ho jate hai
 Why there is no complete news about that side
 kya ye aapako bhayaavah nahin lagata he, itane saalon se javaanon par hamale ho rahe hai, itane saalon se ham or aap vahi baaten kar rahe hai
 Around 100 CRPF personnel have been attacked
 yuddh or naksal prabhavit ilaakon main jane kii training unhen bhi hoti he
 Authorities' descriptions of the attack suggest that the Naxalites had a heavy upper hand
 hamale main naksali javaanon ke purse or mobile bhi lut le gaye hai
 How did they get so much time? adhikariyon ke in bayanon ke baad bhi kai baar lagata he ki ghatana ke bare main sahi-sahi andaaza nahin mil rahaa he
 Is it so easy to surround 100 armed soldiers? 25 javaanon kii maut hui he
 It is being claimed that some Naxalites have also been killed, why some Naxalites were killed when they came in the number of 300, but there is one thing, CRPF soldiers also saved 40 people engaged in road construction work
 
 unki bahaduree kaa ye paksh bhi kam shandaar nahin he
 Martyrdom will not go in vain, everything ends at this, it does not begin why martyrdom took place
 aise kaise hamaare javaanon ko koi gher kar maar degaa or gaayab ho jayega
 The list of looting by the Maoists from the CRPF jawans is as follows - a total of 22 weapons were looted, 12 AK 47 rifles (five of which were under-barrel grenade launchers), AKM-4, INSAS Light Machine Gun-2, INSAS
 Rifle - 3, Wireless Set - 5, Binocular - 2, Bullet Proof Jacket - 22, DSMD - 1 (deep Search Metal Detector), AK 47 - 59 Magazine, AKM - 16 Magazine, Insas LMG - 16 Magazine, Insas Rifle - 15 Magazine, Bullet Gun, AK / AKM - 2820 RO End, Insas - 600 rounds, UPGL - 62 rounds
 tippaniyan Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh has said that Sukma's fight is the biggest fight in the country
 samay aa gaya he ki ek ranneeti ke saath aage badha jaae
 Has the time to move forward with a strategy come only after the death of 25 jawans and 7 wounded, if the battle of Sukma is the biggest battle in the country, then its time has come on 25 April
 is tarah kii baton kaa kya ye matlab he ki desh kii sabase badi ladaai ham bina ranneeti ke lard rahe hai
 It is easy to say, what should we tell about those who pass on the news of sacrifices in their house with waxed words
 chaahate hai ki aap awaz sunen

 hamale main naksali javaanon ke purse or mobile bhi lut le gaye hai
 How did they get so much time? adhikariyon ke in bayanon ke baad bhi kai baar lagata he ki ghatana ke bare main sahi-sahi andaaza nahin mil rahaa he
 Is it so easy to surround 100 armed soldiers? 25 javaanon kii maut hui he
 It is being claimed that some Naxalites have also been killed, why some Naxalites were killed when they came in the number of 300, but there is one thing, CRPF soldiers also saved 40 people engaged in road construction work
 
 unki bahaduree kaa ye paksh bhi kam shandaar nahin he
 Martyrdom will not go in vain, everything ends at this, it does not begin why martyrdom took place
 aise kaise hamaare javaanon ko koi gher kar maar degaa or gaayab ho jayega
 The list of looting by the Maoists from the CRPF jawans is as follows - a total of 22 weapons were looted, 12 AK 47 rifles (five of which were under-barrel grenade launchers), AKM-4, INSAS Light Machine Gun-2, INSAS
 Rifle - 3, Wireless Set - 5, Binocular - 2, Bullet Proof Jacket - 22, DSMD - 1 (deep Search Metal Detector), AK 47 - 59 Magazine, AKM - 16 Magazine, Insas LMG - 16 Magazine, Insas Rifle - 15 Magazine, Bullet Gun, AK / AKM - 2820 RO End, Insas - 600 rounds, UPGL - 62 rounds
 tippaniyan Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh has said that Sukma's fight is the biggest fight in the country
 samay aa gaya he ki ek ranneeti ke saath aage badha jaae
 Has the time to move forward with a strategy come only after the death of 25 jawans and 7 wounded, if the battle of Sukma is the biggest battle in the country, then its time has come on 25 April
 is tarah kii baton kaa kya ye matlab he ki desh kii sabase badi ladaai ham bina ranneeti ke lard rahe hai
 It is easy to say, what should we tell about those who pass on the news of sacrifices in their house with waxed words
 chaahate hai ki aap awaz sunen
 Realize that in those frames we see only in the frame of martyrdom sacrifice, in which frame must be seen in the house husband, brother, father, nephew
 isi sukama main saat saal pehle naksaliyon ne 76 javaanon ko maar diya tha
 This time 25 soldiers have been killed
 bhavuk shabdon se agar insaaf miltaa yaa badla le liya jaataa to ye do shabdon kii do samasyaayein samaapt ho chuki hotin
 The media is also asking for the date of revenge of sacrifice
 tarikh poochne vaale se poocha ja saktaa he ki sab kuch balidaan yaa badla hi he yaa naksali samasya se ladane kii niti-ranneeti kii bhi kabhi samiksha hogi
 So much change has come that now after these attacks no one is asked to resign, no accountability is fixed
 sukama hamale ke vakt bhi pradhanmantri ne grahamantri se baat kii thi, halaat kaa gauge liya tha or grahamantri sukama gaye the
 The incident was condemned and even then it was said that the sacrifice of the soldiers would not go in vain
 tamaam ghatnaon kii reporting bhi sthaayee rup se netaaon kii pratikriya kii tarah hoti ja rahi he
 If the revenge is taken, will the Naxalite problem be solved and why the revenge will be taken of the incident of 24 April, will not the 12 soldiers killed on 11 March be avenged
 unka kyon nahin badla liya gaya
 All i am saying is that you are caught in the language that TV and politics have given you, you are stuck not only us
 ye bhram kii bhashaa he, jisase sirf dharna banati he, soochna or samiksha nahin hoti he
 Listen to the brave soldiers of CRPF
 phir sochiye kaise tamaam gashti, chusti ke baad 300 naksali aam adivasee janata ko dhaal banaakar saamne aa gaye or hamalaa kar diya
 That too during the day
 ek maheene ke bheetar yah duusari badi chook he
 The second major attack is
 ek maheene main hamaare 38 jawan shahid ho gaye hai
 Can we ask the question of the three hundred Naxalites who came in black veneer who looted weapons, killed the soldiers and what is visible in the media, their discarded clothes, water bottles and bullets kiosks
 ye naksali kahaan se itani badi sankhya main aa gaye or itane javaanon ko maar kar gaayab ho gaye
 Now why is there no talk of drone surveillance, satellite images
 hamale ke vakt hamaare jawan soochna takanic se las to honge hi, phir ham kyon nahin jaan pate hai ki javaanon par hamalaa karne vaale ye naksali itane safal kaise ho jate hai
 Why there is no complete news about that side
 kya ye aapako bhayaavah nahin lagata he, itane saalon se javaanon par hamale ho rahe hai, itane saalon se ham or aap vahi baaten kar rahe hai
 Around 100 CRPF personnel have been attacked
 yuddh or naksal prabhavit ilaakon main jane kii training unhen bhi hoti he
 Authorities' descriptions of the attack suggest that the Naxalites had a heavy upper hand
 hamale main naksali javaanon ke purse or mobile bhi lut le gaye hai
