 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 camcorder main teen pramukh ghatak hote hai : lens, imager or recorder 
 lens, imager par prakaash ekatrit or focus karata he
 The imager converts the incident light into an electrical signal

 The optics of a camcorder usually have one or more of the following adjustments: upabhokta ikaayiyon main, uparokt samaayojan aksar swatah hi camecorder ke electronics dwaara niyantrit hote hai, lekin vaanchit ho to hastchalit rup se bhi ise samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 Business units provide direct user control of all major optical functions
 imager, prakaash ko bijli sanket main parivartit karata he
 The camera lens exposes the imager surface and exposes a seamless image array for light
 vidyut charge main prakaash expoger main badal jaataa he
 At the end of the timed exposure, the imager converts the deposited charge into a continuous analog voltage at the output terminals of the imager

 All but the most primitive imaginable camcorders also require a recorder controlled section that allows the user to control the camcorder, the recorded footage and an image control section that controls exposure, focus, and white balance
 To watch from, the playback mode has to be switched to the recorder

 Digital video does not have color drift, vibration, or fade, although some users still prefer the analogue Hi8 and Super VHS-C, since neither of them will allow the "blurred background" or "mosquito noise" of digital compression Does not produce kai maamalon main, ek sampeedit digital recording kii tulana main ek ucch gunvattta vaali analog recording adhik vivaranon ke bajaae adhik vivaran ko dikhaati he
 On the other hand, analogue camcorders of low resolution can negate any advantage

 Theoretically digital information can be stored indefinitely on a digital storage device with zero degradation, although some digital formats often pressure only ~ 10 micrometers apart, a digital recording tap that allows multiple permanent access to digital data Can erase the scene, make it more vulnerable to wrinkles or stretching, but with additional tracking and error on tape Edge usually make up most of the blame
 analog media par video main samaan kshati mushkil se 'shor' hota he, phir bhi ek kharaab lekin dekhne laayak video hota he
 The only limitation is that this video must be viewed in a fully analogue visual system, otherwise the tape will not display the video due to any loss and synchronization problems
 yahaan tak ki dividi par hone vaali digital recording dividi kharabi se guzar sakati he jo ki sthaayee rup se badi maatra data ko mitaa detii he
 One advantage of analog in this case seems to be that an analog recording is usable even when the media holding it have been severely degraded while it has been observed that a small amount of media in a digital recording is seen The degradation makes them "full or zero", meaning that digital recording is ultimately unable to play without costly repairs
 or adhik jaankaree ke liye teppelace camecorder dekhen
 While some older digital camcorder records video on microdrives and lower-sized DVD-RAM or DVD-R, as of 2011, recent camcorders use flash memory and smaller hard disks using MPEG-1, MPEG-2 or MPEG-4

 As of January 2011, 2011 Consumer Electronics International announced a new consumer record class 2011 camcorders
 However, in some parts of the world, newly manufactured tape camcorders may still be available due to low purchasing power or greater consumer price sensitivity in these areas

 In video applications where the operational lack of dslrs can be mitigated by careful planning of each shooting, an increasing number of video productions use dslrs to satisfy the desire for a depth-of-field and optical control perspective, such as Canon
 5D Mark II
 In a studio or on-location setup, the environmental factors and camera placement of the scene are known as beforehand, requiring the director of photography to apply any necessary environmental adjustments, such as lighting, to determine an appropriate camera / lens setup Allow phul feechar steel camere ke sanyukt feechar sets ke liye haal hi main hue vikaas or ek ekal ikai main camecorder, ek combo-camera he

 The development of SWAT in its modern incarnation usually begins with references to Inspector Daryl Gates of the Los Angeles Police Department
 LAPD SWAT team ke shuruyaat ke baad gates ne apni aatmakatha Chief: My Life in the LAPD main likhaa he ki usne SWAT ranneeti or uski vishisht upkaran kaa vikaas nahin kiya he
 Gates wrote that he supported the concept and tried to empower his people to develop this concept and gave him moral support

 20 april 1999 main colorado main kaalambin hai skool hatyakand, SWAT ranneeti or police ke javaabi karrwai ke liye ek or prabhaavshaalee ghatana thi
 The Christian Science Monitor noted in an article that "instead of waiting for the SWAT team to reach out, to take immediate action and provide weapons training to field officers in incidents where the suspect is suspected to have a dangerous weapon" needed

 The idea has been put forward for rapid action by regional officials and in perceived active-shooter situations
 aisi sthitiyon main keval ek paridhi ko set kar SWAT kaa intjaar sweekaarya nahin tha
 As an example, the Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Department policy and manual process states that "MPD personnel are aware of the fact that many active shooter incidents cause some innocent life damage in the early minutes of the incident

 The relatively intermittent invitation of SWAT means that they have been trained at great cost and equipped officers do not sit around waiting for an emergency
 Officers in many departments are normally deployed for regular work but are available for SWAT calls by pagers, mobile phones, or radio transceivers
 yahaan tak ki bade police agenciyon jaise los angeles PD main bhi SWAT karmiyon ko aam taur par aparaadh ke daman kii bhoomikaaon main dekha jaataa he, vishesh or niyamit paharedaari se bhi zyada khatarnaak, lekin is prakaar ke abhiyaan main shaayad adhikari isamen apane vishisht hathiyaar or aujaaron ko nahin le ja saktaa he
 An example of this from the LAPD website shows that in 2003 their SWAT units were active 255 times for 133 SWAT calls and 122 times they served the highest risk warrants

 Jesus is one of the 25 prophets of Islam mentioned in the Quran
 islamic dharamshastra ke anusaar, isa ko mohammad ke baad dusre sabase mahatvapurn sthaan par rakhaa jaataa he
 Almost all of the divine events associated with his autobiography in the Bible are considered in Islam, including: birth from virgin, his miracles, his crucifixion, death and resurrection
 haalaanki quran ke kuch vivochanon ke anusaar, cross par chadhaanaa, mrityu or mritotthana jaaysi ghatnaayen nahin hui thi
 However, Muslims against Christians do not consider Jesus to be a godhead or trinity
 islam main isa messiah ko ek aadarneey nabi mana jaataa he, jo ishwar ne israeliyon ko unke sandesh failaane ko bheja tha
 According to the Quran, Allah gave Jesus the Book of Evil Salt Holy Book, which according to Islamic belief, is one of the four holy books provided by Allah to humanity
 quran main isa ke naam kaa zikr mohammad se bhi zyaada he or musulmaan isa ke kunwari mata dwaara janma maanate hai
 In Islam, Jesus, like all prophets, is considered a mere mortal, and, like Christian belief, is not considered a god-son or member of the Trinity, and their worship is forbidden
 unhen chamatkaar karne kii kshamta ishwar se mili thi or swayan isa main aisi shaktiyaan nahin maujuud thim
 It is also not believed that he hung on the cross
 islamic parampara ke mutabiq, cross par marane ke ba-vajood, ishwar ne unhen sidhe swarg main uthaaya gaya tha
 Like all prophets, Jesus Christ has been called a Muslim in the Quran
 quran ke mutabiq, isa ne apane aap ko ishwar-putr kabhi nahin mana or ve qayamat ke din par is baat kaa inkaar karenge
 The Muslims believe that on the Day of Judgment, Jesus Christ will return to earth and exercise justice
 mohammad ke hadison main he ki "tamaam nabi bhai he or isa messiah mere sabase kareebi bhai he kyunki mere or isa messiah ke darmiyaan koi nabi nahi aayaa he"
 The name of Jesus appears in the Quran 25 times
 suraah mariyam main inke janm kii katha he or isi tarah suraah ali imran main bhi
 The Qur'an mentions Jesus more than Muhammad
 islam main isa kaa cross par chadhana, mrityu or unka punaragaman bahut mahatv rakhata he adhikansh muslmaan, unki mrityu or punaragaman ko nahin maanate
 a large number of Muslims believe that these verses of the Quran, which mention the death of Christ, are just idioms
 adhinaansh ulema kaa kahana he ki messiah ke cross par nahin chadhaaya gaya tha, balki unhen jananath main uthaa liya gaya
 While some other Ulema believe that after his death, he was resurrected by God and then taken to Jannat
 lekin is par sabhi musalmaan ulema kii sahmati he ki messiah qayamat samay, punah dharti par aaenge or ishwar kii ichha ke anusaar dharti par islam lagu karenge

 yah dekha gaya he ki is cancer ke 90% rogi nishchit taur par tambaaku seven karte hai
 The risk of lung cancer depends on how many cigarettes he smokes throughout the day and for how long
 isse chikitsak rogi ke dhumrapaan itihaas ke pack year kii gananaa karata hai
 Suppose a person has been drinking 2 packets of cigarettes daily for 10 years, then his smoking history is 20 pack-years
 vyakti main 10 pack-year kaa dhumrapaan itihaas bhi fefde ke cancer kaa jokhim rahata he, lekin 30 pack-year main fefde ke cancer kaa jokhim bahut hi zyada hota he
 14% of people who drink more than 2 packets of cigarettes die of lung cancer
 bidi, pipe or cigar pine vaale logon ko fefde ke cancer kaa jokhim dhumrapaan nahin karne vaale vyakti se paanch guna adhik rahata he
 Whereas cigarette smokers are 25 times more at risk
 tambaaku main nicotine samet 400 cancerkari padaarth hote hai, jinamein pramukh hai nitrasemins or policystic aromatic hydrocarbons
 a good news for those who quit cigarettes is that after quitting cigarettes, the risk of cancer decreases year after year and after 15 years they become equal to those who have never smoked cigarettes
 kyonki unke fefdon main nai koshikaaye banane lagati he or puraani nasht hoti jaati hai
 People living with smokers or spending long time with them also have a 24% higher risk of cancer than normal people
 america main har saal fefde ke cancer se marane vaale rogiyon main se 3000 rogi is shrenee ke hote hai
 Asbestos is the fiber of many types of mineral silicates
 iske taparodhi or vidyutarodhi gunon ke kaaran kai udyogon main iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 By breathing here, these fibers reach the lungs and continue to collect
 in udyogon main kaam karne vaale logon main fefde ke cancer or mesothelioma kaa jokhim saamaanya logon se 5 guna adhik rahata he
 If they also smoke then the risk is 50-90 times
 isliye aajkal adhiktar udyogon main asbestus kaa prayog yaa to pratibandhit kar diya he yaa simit kar diya gaya he
 Raiden is a natural, invisible, odorless and inert gas formed by the dissolution of uranium

 Lung cancer mainly consists of two species
 1- small cell cancer or 2- non small cell cancer 
 This classification is based on the microstructure of cancer
 in donon tarah ke cancer kii sanvruddhi, sthalaantar or upachaar bhi alag-alag hota he
 Therefore, this classification is also considered necessary
 20% fefde ke cancer small cell cancer prajati ke hote hai
 It is very aggressive and spreads very fast
 yah hameshaa dhumrapaan karne se hota he
 Only 1% of small cell cancer patients are non-smokers
 yah sharir ke duurastha angon main teji se sthalaantar karata he
 Often, at the time of diagnosis, it has spread to many parts of the body
 apni visisth sookshm sanrachana ke kaaran ise oot cell carcinoma bhi kehete hai
 Is the most widespread species
 80% fefde ke cancer non small cell cancer prajati ke hote hai
 They are divided into the following subspecies based on microstructure
 yah sabase vyapak upjati he
 It is related to smoking but non-smokers may also
 praayah yah fefde ke bahari hisse main utpann hota he
 a special type of bronchioalveolar carcinoma is also included in this subfamily, which is produced in many places in the lungs and spreads through the air sacs
 pehle adinocarcinoma se adhik vyapak tha, lekin aajkal is prajati kii vyapaktaa ghat kar adinocarcinoma kii maatra 30 % rah gai he
 It is also known as epidermoid carcinoma
 praayah yah fefde ke madhya kii kisi shwaas nalee se utpann hota he
 It is also called undifferentiated carcinoma
 yah sabase kam paaya jaataa he
 Sometimes many cancers of this subcaste can also be found together
 fefde main uparokt do mukhya prajatiyon ke alaava bhi anya prakaar ke cancer ho sakate hai
 Their prevalence is 5â10%
 5% fefde ke cancer is prajati ke hote hai
 At the time of diagnosis, the tumor is usually small and the age of the patient is less than 40 years
 yah dhumrapaan se sambandhit nahin hota he
 Many times this tumor secretes a substance such as hormones, from which certain symptoms are seen
 yah dhire-dhire badhata or failata he, isliye nidaan ke samay upachaar ke paryaapt vikalp rahete hai
 
 sharir ke kai angon ke mul cancer kii koshikaayen rakt-vahikaaon yaa lasika-vahikaaon dwaara chal kar fefde main pahunch kar sthalaantar cancer utpann kar sakati hai
 Cancer cells can reach the lungs directly by moving from nearby organs
 sthalaantar cancer main praayah fefde ke bahari hisse kai arbud ban jate hai
 This disease has a variety of symptoms that depend on the position and location of the tumor
 praarambhik avasthaa main saamanytah cancer ke spasht or gambhir lakshan nahin hote hai
 25% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with X-ray or CT scan done for some other purpose
 praayah eksre yaa siti main ek sikke ke aakaar kii ek chaaya cancer ko ingit karti he
 Often these patients do not have any symptoms
 arbud kii sanvruddhi or fefde main uske failaav ke kaaran shwasan lene main baadha utpann hoti he, jisase khaansee, shwaas ksht, saans main ghargharaahat, chaati main dard, khaansee main khun aana jaise lakshan ho sakate hai
 If the tumor engages a pulse, the pain in the shoulder that spreads to the back of the arm or paralysis of the sound device causes a hoarseness in the voice
 yadi arbud ne bhojan nalee par akraman kar diya he to khaanaa nigalane main dikkat ho sakati he
 If the tumor blocks a large respiratory tract, then that part of the lung shrinks, causing infection
 fefde kaa cancer teji se rakt-vahikaaon yaa lasika-vahikaaon dwaara duurastha ango main pahunch jaataa he
 Bone, adrenal gland, brain and liver are the main places of translocation
 ise yaad rakhane kaa smriti-sutara Babul he
 If this cancer spreads to the bones, then there is a lot of pain at that place
 yadi cancer mastishk main pahunch jaataa he to sir dard, daura, najar main dhunaalaapan, stroke ke lakshan jaise sharir ke kuch hisson main kamajori yaa sunnata aadi lakshan ho sakate hai
 Many times in this cancer, cancer cells secrete certain chemicals like hormones, which cause certain symptoms
 ye peranioplastic lakshan praayah small cell carcinoma main hote hai, parantu kisi bhi prajati ke cancer main ho sakate hai
 Some small cell carcinomas secrete adenocorticotrophic hormones, as a result of which the adrenal glands secrete more cortisol hormones and the patient may have symptoms of Cushing's syndrome
 isi tarah kuch non small cell carcinoma perathyroid hormone jaisaa rasayan banaate hai jisase rakt main calcium kaa str bad jaataa he
 Such as weakness, weight loss, tiredness, depression, and mood disorders can occur

 By interrogation and testing of the patient, the doctor often gets some symptoms and signs that point towards cancer
 vah dhumrapaan, khaansee, saans lene main koi takalif, shwasanpath main koi rukaawat, sankraman aadi ke bare vistaar se jaan letaa he
 The bluish appearance of the skin or mucosa indicates a lack of oxygen in the blood

 This technique can determine the stage of cancer
 Exceeds and has been a boon in the diagnosis of cancer
 bone scan dwaara haddiyon ke chitra computer ke patal yaa film par liye jate hai
 Doctors make bone scans to know whether lung cancer has reached the bones
 iske liye rogi kii shira main ek radiodharmee dawa chodi jaati he
 This medicine gets collected in the bones where the cancer has made its place
 mashin kaa scanner radiodharmee dawa ko grahan kar letaa he or haddi kaa chitra film par utaar letaa he
 The final diagnosis of lung cancer is made only after a pathologist examines tumors or cancer cells
 iske liye ek saral tarika balgam kii sookshmdarshi jaanch karnaa he
 If the tumor is located in the middle of the lung and has extended to the trachea, cancer cells are seen in the mucus
 yah sasti or jokhimarahit jaanch he
 But its scope is limited because cancer cells do not always appear in the mucus
 kai baar saadhaaran koshikaayen bhi sankraman yaa aghat ke kaaran cancer koshikaon kii tarah lagati hai
 The respiratory and lungs are visualized by inserting a thin and rigid or flexible fiberoptic tube connected to a light source in the trachea by the nose or mouth

 If the tumor is visible and a sample is taken, diagnosis of cancer becomes possible
 is jaanch ke baad kuch rogiyon ko 1 yaa 2 din tak khaansee main gaharaa bhura khun aa saktaa he
 Its serious complications can be bleeding, low oxygen in the blood, heart arrhythmia, etc

 This technique proves very useful if the cancerous knot is located in the outer parts of the lung and where the bronchoscope is unable to reach
 iske liye chaati kii twachaa main sunn karne kii sui lagaai jaati he
 a long needle is then inserted into the chest to the cancerous knot

 But sometimes the pathologist is not able to take the tissue from the right place

 Sometimes the cancer also reaches the outer covering of the lungs, called the plura, and this causes fluid to collect between the lungs and the chest
 is taral ko sui dwaara nikaal kar usamen sookshmdarshi se cancer koshikaon kii jaanch kii jaati he
 This technique also carries little risk of pneumothorax
 yadi uparokt sabhi tareekon se bhi cancer kaa nidaan nahin ho paye to shalya hi antim vikalp bachataa he
 The first option is mediastinoscopy, in which a sample of cells is taken from the tumor or lymphoid by surgically inserting a probe between the two lungs
 doosraa vikalp thorocotomi he jisamen chaati ko khol kar cancer koshikaon ke namoonay le liye jate hai
 It is not possible to completely remove the tumor through these operations
 iske liye rogi ko bhartee kiya jaataa he or shalya kriya shalya kaksh main hi kii jaati he
 There is also a risk of bleeding, infection, anesthesia and other drug side effects

 Treatment decisions depend on the size, condition, growth, extent, location and age of the patient and the health of the cancer
 anya cancer kii tarah hi fefde ke cancer kaa upachaar bhi upachaaratmak yaa prashamak ho saktaa he
 Often more than one type of treatment is given
 jab koi upachaar mukhya upachaar ke prabhaav ko badhaane ke liye diya jaataa he to use sahaayak upachaar kehete hai
 For example, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is given as adjuvant therapy to kill the remaining cancer cells after surgery
 yadi upachaar shalya ke pehle arbud ko chota karne ke liye diya jaataa he to use nav sahaayak upachaar kehete hai
 Cancer resection is the most appropriate treatment if the cancer has not spread beyond the lungs
 cancer kaa uchhedan non small cell cancer ke kuch charnon main kiya jaataa he
 Usually, surgery is done in 10% -35% of the patients of this cancer, but the patient does not get complete relief because the cancer has spread a lot at the time of diagnosis and after the surgery the cancer can regenerate anytime

 Sometimes the cancer of the patient is structurally operable but due to the serious condition of the patient, surgery can be risky
 small cell cancer main shalya-kriya kii sambhaavna apekshaakrit kam rahati he
 Because it spreads rapidly and cannot be confined to one part of the lung
 shalya kriya arbud ke amaap or sthiti par nirbhar karti he
 This is a major surgery, the patient has to be admitted and kept in the hospital for long-term care even after surgery
 isamen rogi ko behosh kiya jaataa he or chaati ko kholana padataa he
 After this, the surgeon removes a part of the lung, a section of the lung or the entire lung

 Radiotherapy is given in both small cell and non small cell cancers
 radiation upachaar main shaktishaalee eksre yaa anya prakaar ke radiation dwaara vikasshil cancer koshikaon ko maaraa jaataa he
 Radiotherapy is given as adjuvant therapy with curative, palliative or other treatments
 radiation yaa to baahar se mashin ko cancer par candrit karke diya jaataa he yaa radiodharmee padaarth se bhare chote se capsyul sharir main cancer kii ganth ke paas avasthit karke diya jaataa he
 In brachytherapy, a small pellet filled with radioactive material is placed by the bronchoscope in a cancerous lump or in a nearby trachea
 isamen pellette se radiation choti si duuri tay karata he isliye yah aasapaas ke swasth utakon ko nuksaan bahut kam karata he
 Brachytherapy is prevalent for shortening the cancerous node and treating symptoms caused by cancer located in the trachea
 yadi rogi shalya-kriya ke liye manaa kar detaa he, uskaa cancer lasicaparv yaa shwaasanlee tak itnaa fail chukaa he ki shalya-kriya sambhav hi nahin he yaa kisi anya gambhir rog ke kaaran uski shalya-kriya karnaa munasib nahin he to use radiotherapy di jaati he
 Radiation when given as the main treatment, it only shortens the lump or limits its growth, which keeps the patient healthy for some time
 10%-15% rogi lambe samay tak swasth jivan ji lete hai
 If chemotherapy is also given along with radiotherapy, then the expectation of living increases slightly

 External radiation is given 4 or 5 days a week for a period of several weeks
 radiation therapy main shalya-kriya kii tarah bade jokhim nahin rahete hai, lekin kuch apriy kuprabhav jaise thakaavat or kamajori to hote hi hai
 Reduction of white blood cells or reduction of spores are also the effects of radiation

 In chemotherapy drugs are given to kill cancer cells or prevent their rapid division
 chemotherapy ko upachaaratmak, shalya-kriya yaa radiotherapy ke saath sahaayak upachaar ke rup main di jaati he
 Although many chemo drugs are popular nowadays, but platinum-like drugs such as cisplatin or carboplatin have proved to be the most effective in lung cancer
 lagbhag sabhi small cell cancer main chemotherapy hi sabase mufeed ilaaj he, kyonki nidaan ke samay hi yah praayah puure sharir main fail chukaa hota he
 Only half of small cell cancer patients survive four months without chemotherapy
 lekin chimo ke baad unka jivan lambaa to hota hi he
 Chemo alone has not proved to be so effective in non-small cell cancer, but if the cancer has passed, then the life span of many patients increases

 All the major cancer experts of Allopathy are excited and celebrating this targeted therapy as a new wave of joy in cancer treatment
 ve kah rahe hai ki har cancer main ek hi dawa dene kii maansikta ab khatm hui samajho
 Before taking targeted therapy, a sample of the cancer is tested and it is found out which mutations have occurred in such cancers
 isi ke aadhaar par targated dawa kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 14 US organizations are conducting this investigation for free
 haalanki abhi tak kai muteshan chinhit kiye ja chuke hai, lekin sabhi ke liye abhi targated dawa viksit nahin ho pai hai
 Nowadays, three mutations EGFR, ALK and KRAS are tested
