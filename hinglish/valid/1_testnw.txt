 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 All but the most primitive imaginable camcorders also require a recorder controlled section that allows the user to control the camcorder, the recorded footage and an image control section that controls exposure, focus, and white balance
 To watch from, the playback mode has to be switched to the recorder

 Theoretically digital information can be stored indefinitely on a digital storage device with zero degradation, although some digital formats often pressure only ~ 10 micrometers apart, a digital recording tap that allows multiple permanent access to digital data Can erase the scene, make it more vulnerable to wrinkles or stretching, but with additional tracking and error on tape Edge usually make up most of the blame

 The only limitation is that this video must be viewed in a fully analogue visual system, otherwise the tape will not display the video due to any loss and synchronization problems
 yahaan tak ki dividi par hone vaali digital recording dividi kharabi se guzar sakati he jo ki sthaayee rup se badi maatra data ko mitaa detii he
 One advantage of analog in this case seems to be that an analog recording is usable even when the media holding it have been severely degraded while it has been observed that a small amount of media in a digital recording is seen The degradation makes them "full or zero", meaning that digital recording is ultimately unable to play without costly repairs
 or adhik jaankaree ke liye teppelace camecorder dekhen
 While some older digital camcorder records video on microdrives and lower-sized DVD-RAM or DVD-R, as of 2011, recent camcorders use flash memory and smaller hard disks using MPEG-1, MPEG-2 or MPEG-4

 20 april 1999 main colorado main kaalambin hai skool hatyakand, SWAT ranneeti or police ke javaabi karrwai ke liye ek or prabhaavshaalee ghatana thi

 The idea has been put forward for rapid action by regional officials and in perceived active-shooter situations
 aisi sthitiyon main keval ek paridhi ko set kar SWAT kaa intjaar sweekaarya nahin tha
 As an example, the Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Department policy and manual process states that "MPD personnel are aware of the fact that many active shooter incidents cause some innocent life damage in the early minutes of the incident

 The relatively intermittent invitation of SWAT means that they have been trained at great cost and equipped officers do not sit around waiting for an emergency
 Officers in many departments are normally deployed for regular work but are available for SWAT calls by pagers, mobile phones, or radio transceivers
 yahaan tak ki bade police agenciyon jaise los angeles PD main bhi SWAT karmiyon ko aam taur par aparaadh ke daman kii bhoomikaaon main dekha jaataa he, vishesh or niyamit paharedaari se bhi zyada khatarnaak, lekin is prakaar ke abhiyaan main shaayad adhikari isamen apane vishisht hathiyaar or aujaaron ko nahin le ja saktaa he

 Jesus is one of the 25 prophets of Islam mentioned in the Quran
 islamic dharamshastra ke anusaar, isa ko mohammad ke baad dusre sabase mahatvapurn sthaan par rakhaa jaataa he
 Almost all of the divine events associated with his autobiography in the Bible are considered in Islam, including: birth from virgin, his miracles, his crucifixion, death and resurrection
 haalaanki quran ke kuch vivochanon ke anusaar, cross par chadhaanaa, mrityu or mritotthana jaaysi ghatnaayen nahin hui thi
 However, Muslims against Christians do not consider Jesus to be a godhead or trinity
 islam main isa messiah ko ek aadarneey nabi mana jaataa he, jo ishwar ne israeliyon ko unke sandesh failaane ko bheja tha
 According to the Quran, Allah gave Jesus the Book of Evil Salt Holy Book, which according to Islamic belief, is one of the four holy books provided by Allah to humanity
 quran main isa ke naam kaa zikr mohammad se bhi zyaada he or musulmaan isa ke kunwari mata dwaara janma maanate hai
 In Islam, Jesus, like all prophets, is considered a mere mortal, and, like Christian belief, is not considered a god-son or member of the Trinity, and their worship is forbidden
 unhen chamatkaar karne kii kshamta ishwar se mili thi or swayan isa main aisi shaktiyaan nahin maujuud thim
 It is also not believed that he hung on the cross
 islamic parampara ke mutabiq, cross par marane ke ba-vajood, ishwar ne unhen sidhe swarg main uthaaya gaya tha
 Like all prophets, Jesus Christ has been called a Muslim in the Quran
 quran ke mutabiq, isa ne apane aap ko ishwar-putr kabhi nahin mana or ve qayamat ke din par is baat kaa inkaar karenge
 The Muslims believe that on the Day of Judgment, Jesus Christ will return to earth and exercise justice
 mohammad ke hadison main he ki "tamaam nabi bhai he or isa messiah mere sabase kareebi bhai he kyunki mere or isa messiah ke darmiyaan koi nabi nahi aayaa he"
 The name of Jesus appears in the Quran 25 times
 suraah mariyam main inke janm kii katha he or isi tarah suraah ali imran main bhi
 The Qur'an mentions Jesus more than Muhammad
 islam main isa kaa cross par chadhana, mrityu or unka punaragaman bahut mahatv rakhata he adhikansh muslmaan, unki mrityu or punaragaman ko nahin maanate
 a large number of Muslims believe that these verses of the Quran, which mention the death of Christ, are just idioms
 adhinaansh ulema kaa kahana he ki messiah ke cross par nahin chadhaaya gaya tha, balki unhen jananath main uthaa liya gaya
 While some other Ulema believe that after his death, he was resurrected by God and then taken to Jannat
 lekin is par sabhi musalmaan ulema kii sahmati he ki messiah qayamat samay, punah dharti par aaenge or ishwar kii ichha ke anusaar dharti par islam lagu karenge

 Only 1% of small cell cancer patients are non-smokers
 yah sharir ke duurastha angon main teji se sthalaantar karata he
 Often, at the time of diagnosis, it has spread to many parts of the body
 apni visisth sookshm sanrachana ke kaaran ise oot cell carcinoma bhi kehete hai
 Is the most widespread species
 80% fefde ke cancer non small cell cancer prajati ke hote hai
 They are divided into the following subspecies based on microstructure
 yah sabase vyapak upjati he
 It is related to smoking but non-smokers may also
 praayah yah fefde ke bahari hisse main utpann hota he
 a special type of bronchioalveolar carcinoma is also included in this subfamily, which is produced in many places in the lungs and spreads through the air sacs
 pehle adinocarcinoma se adhik vyapak tha, lekin aajkal is prajati kii vyapaktaa ghat kar adinocarcinoma kii maatra 30 % rah gai he
 It is also known as epidermoid carcinoma
 praayah yah fefde ke madhya kii kisi shwaas nalee se utpann hota he
 It is also called undifferentiated carcinoma
 yah sabase kam paaya jaataa he
 Sometimes many cancers of this subcaste can also be found together
 fefde main uparokt do mukhya prajatiyon ke alaava bhi anya prakaar ke cancer ho sakate hai
 Their prevalence is 5–10%
 5% fefde ke cancer is prajati ke hote hai
 At the time of diagnosis, the tumor is usually small and the age of the patient is less than 40 years
 yah dhumrapaan se sambandhit nahin hota he
 Many times this tumor secretes a substance such as hormones, from which certain symptoms are seen
 yah dhire-dhire badhata or failata he, isliye nidaan ke samay upachaar ke paryaapt vikalp rahete hai
 
 sharir ke kai angon ke mul cancer kii koshikaayen rakt-vahikaaon yaa lasika-vahikaaon dwaara chal kar fefde main pahunch kar sthalaantar cancer utpann kar sakati hai
 Cancer cells can reach the lungs directly by moving from nearby organs
 sthalaantar cancer main praayah fefde ke bahari hisse kai arbud ban jate hai
 This disease has a variety of symptoms that depend on the position and location of the tumor
 praarambhik avasthaa main saamanytah cancer ke spasht or gambhir lakshan nahin hote hai
 25% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with X-ray or CT scan done for some other purpose
 praayah eksre yaa siti main ek sikke ke aakaar kii ek chaaya cancer ko ingit karti he
 Often these patients do not have any symptoms
 arbud kii sanvruddhi or fefde main uske failaav ke kaaran shwasan lene main baadha utpann hoti he, jisase khaansee, shwaas ksht, saans main ghargharaahat, chaati main dard, khaansee main khun aana jaise lakshan ho sakate hai
 If the tumor engages a pulse, the pain in the shoulder that spreads to the back of the arm or paralysis of the sound device causes a hoarseness in the voice
 yadi arbud ne bhojan nalee par akraman kar diya he to khaanaa nigalane main dikkat ho sakati he
 If the tumor blocks a large respiratory tract, then that part of the lung shrinks, causing infection
 fefde kaa cancer teji se rakt-vahikaaon yaa lasika-vahikaaon dwaara duurastha ango main pahunch jaataa he
 Bone, adrenal gland, brain and liver are the main places of translocation
 ise yaad rakhane kaa smriti-sutara Babul he
 If this cancer spreads to the bones, then there is a lot of pain at that place
 yadi cancer mastishk main pahunch jaataa he to sir dard, daura, najar main dhunaalaapan, stroke ke lakshan jaise sharir ke kuch hisson main kamajori yaa sunnata aadi lakshan ho sakate hai
 Many times in this cancer, cancer cells secrete certain chemicals like hormones, which cause certain symptoms
 ye peranioplastic lakshan praayah small cell carcinoma main hote hai, parantu kisi bhi prajati ke cancer main ho sakate hai
 Some small cell carcinomas secrete adenocorticotrophic hormones, as a result of which the adrenal glands secrete more cortisol hormones and the patient may have symptoms of Cushing's syndrome
 isi tarah kuch non small cell carcinoma perathyroid hormone jaisaa rasayan banaate hai jisase rakt main calcium kaa str bad jaataa he
 Such as weakness, weight loss, tiredness, depression, and mood disorders can occur
 yadi rogi ko nimna lakshan hon to turant chikitsak se sampark karnaa chaiye
 • a high cough or chronic cough suddenly increases
 • khaansee main khun aana
 • Pain in chest
 • tej bronchitis yaa baar-baar shwasan path main sankraman ho rahaa ho
 • Sudden weight loss or tiredness
 • shwaasaksht yaa saans lene main ghargharaahat hoti ho
 By interrogation and testing of the patient, the doctor often gets some symptoms and signs that point towards cancer
 vah dhumrapaan, khaansee, saans lene main koi takalif, shwasanpath main koi rukaawat, sankraman aadi ke bare vistaar se jaan letaa he
 The bluish appearance of the skin or mucosa indicates a lack of oxygen in the blood
 naakhunon ke aadhaar kaa phool janaa chirkaari fefde ke rog ko darshata he
 a chest X-ray is the first accessible test for any new lung symptom
 kai baar fefde ke eksre main dikhaai dene vaali chaaya cancer kaa andeh maatr paidaa karti he
 But X-ray does not prove that this shade is of cancer
 isi tarah fefde main asthikrut parvika yaa sugam arbud jaise hemertoma eksre main cancer jaise hi dikhaai dete hai
 Therefore, other tests are done for the final diagnosis
 fefde ke cancer tathaa sthalaantar cancer ke nidaan hetu chaati, udar or mastishk kaa si

 Often CT Radio opaque contrast medicine is left in the patient's vein before being scanned, which makes the internal components and tissues and their condition appear more clear and emergent
 contrast dawa dene ke pehle sensitivity test kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes it can cause symptoms of harmful reaction like itching, rash, skin rash etc

 This technique can determine the stage of cancer
 Exceeds and has been a boon in the diagnosis of cancer
 bone scan dwaara haddiyon ke chitra computer ke patal yaa film par liye jate hai
 Doctors make bone scans to know whether lung cancer has reached the bones
 iske liye rogi kii shira main ek radiodharmee dawa chodi jaati he
 This medicine gets collected in the bones where the cancer has made its place
 mashin kaa scanner radiodharmee dawa ko grahan kar letaa he or haddi kaa chitra film par utaar letaa he
 The final diagnosis of lung cancer is made only after a pathologist examines tumors or cancer cells
 iske liye ek saral tarika balgam kii sookshmdarshi jaanch karnaa he
 If the tumor is located in the middle of the lung and has extended to the trachea, cancer cells are seen in the mucus
 yah sasti or jokhimarahit jaanch he
 But its scope is limited because cancer cells do not always appear in the mucus
 kai baar saadhaaran koshikaayen bhi sankraman yaa aghat ke kaaran cancer koshikaon kii tarah lagati hai
 The respiratory and lungs are visualized by inserting a thin and rigid or flexible fiberoptic tube connected to a light source in the trachea by the nose or mouth

 In this, the patient feels discomfort and pain, so a needle of sleep or unconsciousness is applied
 yah jaanch apekshaakrit surakshit he phir bhi anbhavi visheshgy dwaara kii jaani chaiye
 If the tumor is visible and a sample is taken, diagnosis of cancer becomes possible
 is jaanch ke baad kuch rogiyon ko 1 yaa 2 din tak khaansee main gaharaa bhura khun aa saktaa he
 Its serious complications can be bleeding, low oxygen in the blood, heart arrhythmia, etc
 yah sabase saamaanya jaanch he jisamen sonography yaa si

 This technique proves very useful if the cancerous knot is located in the outer parts of the lung and where the bronchoscope is unable to reach
 iske liye chaati kii twachaa main sunn karne kii sui lagaai jaati he
 a long needle is then inserted into the chest to the cancerous knot
 sonography yaa si

 But sometimes the pathologist is not able to take the tissue from the right place

 Sometimes the cancer also reaches the outer covering of the lungs, called the plura, and this causes fluid to collect between the lungs and the chest
 is taral ko sui dwaara nikaal kar usamen sookshmdarshi se cancer koshikaon kii jaanch kii jaati he
 This technique also carries little risk of pneumothorax
 yadi uparokt sabhi tareekon se bhi cancer kaa nidaan nahin ho paye to shalya hi antim vikalp bachataa he
 The first option is mediastinoscopy, in which a sample of cells is taken from the tumor or lymphoid by surgically inserting a probe between the two lungs
 doosraa vikalp thorocotomi he jisamen chaati ko khol kar cancer koshikaon ke namoonay le liye jate hai
 It is not possible to completely remove the tumor through these operations
 iske liye rogi ko bhartee kiya jaataa he or shalya kriya shalya kaksh main hi kii jaati he
 There is also a risk of bleeding, infection, anesthesia and other drug side effects

 Treatment decisions depend on the size, condition, growth, extent, location and age of the patient and the health of the cancer
 anya cancer kii tarah hi fefde ke cancer kaa upachaar bhi upachaaratmak yaa prashamak ho saktaa he
 Often more than one type of treatment is given
 jab koi upachaar mukhya upachaar ke prabhaav ko badhaane ke liye diya jaataa he to use sahaayak upachaar kehete hai
 For example, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is given as adjuvant therapy to kill the remaining cancer cells after surgery
 yadi upachaar shalya ke pehle arbud ko chota karne ke liye diya jaataa he to use nav sahaayak upachaar kehete hai
 Cancer resection is the most appropriate treatment if the cancer has not spread beyond the lungs
 cancer kaa uchhedan non small cell cancer ke kuch charnon main kiya jaataa he
 Usually, surgery is done in 10% -35% of the patients of this cancer, but the patient does not get complete relief because the cancer has spread a lot at the time of diagnosis and after the surgery the cancer can regenerate anytime

 jin rogiyon main dhimi gati se badhane vaale ekaaki cancer kaa shalya kiya jaataa he, unamem se 25%-40% rogi paanch saal ji hi lete hai
 Sometimes the cancer of the patient is structurally operable but due to the serious condition of the patient, surgery can be risky
 small cell cancer main shalya-kriya kii sambhaavna apekshaakrit kam rahati he
 Because it spreads rapidly and cannot be confined to one part of the lung
 shalya kriya arbud ke amaap or sthiti par nirbhar karti he
 This is a major surgery, the patient has to be admitted and kept in the hospital for long-term care even after surgery
 isamen rogi ko behosh kiya jaataa he or chaati ko kholana padataa he
 After this, the surgeon removes a part of the lung, a section of the lung or the entire lung
 kabhi-kabhi fefde main sthit lasicaparv bhi nikaale jate hai
 After surgery, the patient suffers from breathing, exhalation, pain and weakness
 rakt srav, sankraman or nishchetan ke kuprabhav shalya ke mukhya khatre hai
 Radiotherapy is given in both small cell and non small cell cancers
 radiation upachaar main shaktishaalee eksre yaa anya prakaar ke radiation dwaara vikasshil cancer koshikaon ko maaraa jaataa he
 Radiotherapy is given as adjuvant therapy with curative, palliative or other treatments
 radiation yaa to baahar se mashin ko cancer par candrit karke diya jaataa he yaa radiodharmee padaarth se bhare chote se capsyul sharir main cancer kii ganth ke paas avasthit karke diya jaataa he
 In brachytherapy, a small pellet filled with radioactive material is placed by the bronchoscope in a cancerous lump or in a nearby trachea
 isamen pellette se radiation choti si duuri tay karata he isliye yah aasapaas ke swasth utakon ko nuksaan bahut kam karata he
 Brachytherapy is prevalent for shortening the cancerous node and treating symptoms caused by cancer located in the trachea
 yadi rogi shalya-kriya ke liye manaa kar detaa he, uskaa cancer lasicaparv yaa shwaasanlee tak itnaa fail chukaa he ki shalya-kriya sambhav hi nahin he yaa kisi anya gambhir rog ke kaaran uski shalya-kriya karnaa munasib nahin he to use radiotherapy di jaati he
 Radiation when given as the main treatment, it only shortens the lump or limits its growth, which keeps the patient healthy for some time
 10%-15% rogi lambe samay tak swasth jivan ji lete hai
 If chemotherapy is also given along with radiotherapy, then the expectation of living increases slightly

 If the patient has a serious lung disease other than cancer, radiotherapy may not be given as there is a risk of worsening of the lung condition
 ek vishesh tarah kii gamma nif naamak bahya radiotherapy mastishk main ekaaki sthalaantar cancer ke liye di jaati he
 In this, by stabilizing the head, several elements of radiation are focused on the cancer and radiation is given for a few minutes or hours
 isamen swasth utakon ko radiation kii apekshaakrit kam maatra milti he
 In external radiation therapy, prior to treatment, with the help of a CT scan, computer and the correct measurement, simulation is done to find out where the radiation is being concentrated
 isamen 30 minute se do ghante kaa samay lagata he
 External radiation is given 4 or 5 days a week for a period of several weeks
 radiation therapy main shalya-kriya kii tarah bade jokhim nahin rahete hai, lekin kuch apriy kuprabhav jaise thakaavat or kamajori to hote hi hai
 Reduction of white blood cells or reduction of spores are also the effects of radiation
 yadi radiation pachan angon par bhi padataa he to michali, ubakaai aana yaa dast lag sakate hai
 Skin itching and burning may occur
 small cell or non small cell donon prajati ke cancer main chemotherapy di jaati he
 In chemotherapy drugs are given to kill cancer cells or prevent their rapid division
 chemotherapy ko upachaaratmak, shalya-kriya yaa radiotherapy ke saath sahaayak upachaar ke rup main di jaati he
 Although many chemo drugs are popular nowadays, but platinum-like drugs such as cisplatin or carboplatin have proved to be the most effective in lung cancer
 lagbhag sabhi small cell cancer main chemotherapy hi sabase mufeed ilaaj he, kyonki nidaan ke samay hi yah praayah puure sharir main fail chukaa hota he
 Only half of small cell cancer patients survive four months without chemotherapy
 lekin chimo ke baad unka jivan lambaa to hota hi he
 Chemo alone has not proved to be so effective in non-small cell cancer, but if the cancer has passed, then the life span of many patients increases
 chemotherapy goliyon, shira maarg yaa donon tareeke se di jaati he
 Chemo is often OPD Is given in the department

 During this, he suffers from the ill effects of chemo and then gradually gets rid of them, then the next cycle is given
 is tarah chimo ke kai chakra diye jate hai
 Unfortunately, the medicines given in chemo also damage healthy cells, causing many unpleasant and painful side effects
 shwet rakt kan kam hona yaa bimbaanu kam hona chimo ke pramukh kuprabhav hai
 Tiredness, hair loss, nausea, nausea, diarrhea, mouth sores, etc
 are other side effects
 chimo ke kuprabhav dawa kii maatra, mishran main di jane vaali anya dawa or rogi ke swasthya par nirbhar karata he
 Some special medicines are also given for the ill effects of the medicine

 Therefore, the patient can also take new experimental treatments
 kyonki ye upachaar abhi prayogtmak daur main he or chikitsakon ke paas paryaapt jaankariyaan nahin he ki ye upachaar kitne niraapad or asardaar hai
 Therefore, the patient can take this treatment if he wants to take the risk
 non small cell cancer ke jin rogiyon main chimo kaam nahin kar paati he, unhen aajkal targated therapy di jaati he
 All the major cancer experts of Allopathy are excited and celebrating this targeted therapy as a new wave of joy in cancer treatment
 ve kah rahe hai ki har cancer main ek hi dawa dene kii maansikta ab khatm hui samajho
 Before taking targeted therapy, a sample of the cancer is tested and it is found out which mutations have occurred in such cancers
 isi ke aadhaar par targated dawa kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 14 US organizations are conducting this investigation for free
 haalanki abhi tak kai muteshan chinhit kiye ja chuke hai, lekin sabhi ke liye abhi targated dawa viksit nahin ho pai hai
 Nowadays, three mutations EGFR, ALK and KRAS are tested
 non small cell cancer kii upaprajati adinocarcinoma ke 20% se 30% rogiyon main EGFR muteshan hota he
 It is given erlotinib and zefitinib target medicines
 ye tirocine kinage inhibitor shrenee main aati hai
 Targeted therapy is particularly characteristic of cancer cells, causing relatively less damage to normal cells
 arlotinib or jefitinib epedrmal growth fector receptor protein par abhilakshith hoti hai
 This protein helps to increase cell division
 yah protein kai cancer koshikaon jaise non small cell cancer koshikaon ke sataha par badi maatra main vidyaman rahata he
 These are given as abuses
 ye EGFR muteshan vaale cancer rogiyon kaa jeevankaal badhaati he, lekin kuch samay baad rogi ko is dawa se pratirodh ho jaataa he
 Yet one tablet of erlotinib is shot at Rs 4800 on the patient's pocket
 non small cell cancer ke lagbhag 2% se 7% rogiyon main ALK muteshan hota he
 These patients are often young and do not smoke
 iske liye ek nai targated dawa krijotinib anumodith kii gai he
 It inactivates ALK and inhibits the growth of cancer
 yah ganth ko chota karti he or lagbhag 6 maheene tak to sthir rakhti he
 This drug manufactured by Pfizer Company is available under the name Zalkori
 ek maheene kii dawa kaa kharchaa sirf paanch lakh rupee hai
 After all, lung cancer is a royal disease
 targated therapy main antiegiogenesis dawaaen bhi shaamil kii gai hai, jo cancer main nai rakt-vahikaaon ke vikaas ko rokatii he
 Cancer will die without blood vessels
 bivesijumeb naamak antiegiogenesis dawa ko yadi chimo ke saath pragatisheel cancer main diya jaataa he to yah rogi kaa jeevankaal badhaati he
 It is given every two to three weeks in the vein
 is dawa se raktasrav kaa jokhim rahata he, isliye un rogiyon ko nahin dena chaiye jinako khaansee ke saath khun aa rahaa ho, jo anticoegulansion dawa le rahaa ho yaa uskaa cancer mastishk main bhi fail gaya ho
 It should also not be given in squamous cell carcinoma as there is a risk of bleeding
 setuccimeb ek antibody he jo epedrmal growth fector receptor se jud jaati he
 Cetuximeb may benefit if this EGFR is present on the surface of non-small cell cancer
 fefde ke cancer main falanumaan kaa matlab rogi kaa upachaar yaa uske jeevankaal badhane kii sambhaavna se he
 It depends on the size, species, location of the cancer and the health of the patient
 small cell prajati kaa cancer sabase aakraamak or teji se failane vaala cancer he or yadi upachaar nahin kiya jaye to rogi do chaar maheene hi ji paata he
 That is, half of the patients die in two to four months
 small cell cancer main radiation or chemotherapy apekshaakrit adhik asardaar maani jaati he
 Because this cancer spreads very rapidly and has already migrated to many places in the body at the time of diagnosis, surgical or spatial radiation treatment is of little importance
 yadi chemotherapy akele yaa anya upachaar ke saath di jaati he to rogi kaa jivan kaal 4-5 guna badhane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 But even after all prapancha, only 5% -10% of patients get five years of life
 dhumrapaan turant chhodana jaruri hota he
 The prognosis of non-small cell cancer depends on its stage at the time of diagnosis
 yadi pehle charan ke rogi kii ganth shalya dwaara nikaal di jaati he to 75% rogi kii paanch varsh ji lete hai
 Some patients get little relief from radiation treatment
 is cancer main chimo se rogi ke jivan kaal par vishesh fark nahin padataa he
 Lung cancer prediction is much worse than other cancers
 allopathy ke saare upachaar or tamzam ke baavjood sirf 16% rogi paanch varsh hi ji pate hai
