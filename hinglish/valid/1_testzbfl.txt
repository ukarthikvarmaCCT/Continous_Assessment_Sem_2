 In 1851, Tolstoy also entered the army for some time

 In 1854, Tolstoy was sent to the front of the Danube; From there, he shifted to Sebastopol, which was the strongest front of the Crimean War

 In this journey, he witnessed the death of his elder brother suffering from tuberculosis

 The education system of this school was very progressive
 isamen vartmaan parikshapranali evam iske aadhaar par uteern anuteern kaarne kii vyavastha nahin rakhi gai thi
 The school was a big success mainly due to Tolstoy's leadership power and heartfelt passion towards him

 In 1862, Tolstoy was married to a high-ranking elite woman named Safia Berhus
 unke vaivaahik jivan kaa purvaash to bada sukhad rahaa par uttaransh katutapurna beetaa
 In Tolstoy's married life, the ideal of a housewife was completely similar to that of an Indian housewife: but the views of the then Russian elite society were quite different
 1863 se 1869 tak tollstoy kaa samay "waar and pis" kii rachana main evam 1873 se 76 tak kaa samay "anna karenina" kii rachana main beetaa
 Both these compositions greatly elevated Tolstoy's literary fame

 The period from 1875 to 1879 was very disappointing for him - he had lost his faith in God and had taken off on committing suicide

 In 1878–79, he composed his controversial work called "confession"
 iske krantikari vichaar aise hai jinke kaaran rus main iske prakaashan kii anumati bhi nahin mili or pustak switsraland main prakashit hui
 Many of his other compositions of this time are of this category and they are all printed in Switzerland

 His intuition remained entangled in the search for the secret of human life
 ambtak kii samast rachanaayen unhen vyarth prathit hone lageen
 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"
 unke aachaar sambandhi vishwaason ke prati ab sara sansar aakrishth ho chukaa tha or yasnaya polyana gram kii manyata utkrisht tirthasthali ke rup main jagaddhikhyath ho chuki thi

 Towards the end of the 19th century, Tolstoy's service to the poor and helpless grew to such an extent that he donated all his income from his creations to Russia
 apni patni ko maatr utana ansh lene kii unhone anumati di jitna parivaar ke bhar poshan ke liye anivaary tha
 He gave all the proceeds of his novel called 'resurgence' to the Russian pacifist caste Dukhbor people to abandon Russia and settle in Canada
 1910 main sahasaa unhone apane paitrik gram "yasnaya polyana" ko sarvada ke liye parityakt karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He departed with his daughter Alexandra on 10 November 1910, but on 22 November 1910, he accidentally died in a lung in the passage station Estapovo
 unki dharmabhavana badi udaar or vyapak thi
 He had a clear antagonism towards the then Christianity
 apane vichaaron se ve ek prakaar ke sarvadevvaadi prathit hote hai
 He considered death as the inevitable end of the body
 manushya ko ve sharir kii antim or avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered it appropriate to assess everything that came in contact with human beings from the criteria of utility and for this reason he always remained curious about the purpose of life
 niruddeshy, vichaarheen ore aatmakendrit jivan ko ve ek prakaar kaa paap maanate the; yahan tak ki sambhog ko ve keval santanotpatti ke uddeshy se hi vihit maanate the
 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 gopalpur pirpanti, bhagalpur, bihar sthit ek gaanv he
 a newspaper or a newspaper is a publication based on news, in which information, mainly current affairs, politics, sports, personalities, advertisements, etc
, are printed on cheap paper
 samachar patr sanchaar ke sadhano main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 Newspapers are usually daily, but some newspapers are weekly, fortnightly, monthly and even half-yearly
 adhiktar samachaarpatr sthaneey bhashaaon main or sthaneey vishyon par kendrit hote hai
 The earliest known newspaper was 59 BC
 Is 'the Roman Acta Diurna'
 julies sisar ne janasadhran ko mahatvapurn rajnatijna or samaajik ghatnaon se avgat karaane ke liye unhe shahro ke pramukh sthano par preshit kiya
 Handwritten newspapers were introduced in China in the 8th century
 akhbaar kaa itihaas or yogadan: yun to british shashan ke ek purv adhikari ke dwaara akhabaaron kii shuruyaat maani jaati he, lekin uskaa swaroop akhabaaron kii tarah nahin tha
 It was only a one-page informational paper
 purnroopen akhbaar bengal se 'bengal-gajet' ke naam se vysarai hikki dwaara nikaala gaya tha
 Initially, the British used newspapers for their own benefit, as all newspapers were coming out in English, so news and information could not reach the majority of people
 jo khabaren baahar nikalakar aati thintra se guzarate, vahaan apana aatank failaate rahete the
 There were neither cases nor any punishment against them
 in naarkeey paristhitiyon ko jhelte hue bhi log khamosh the
 During this period, newspapers such as 'the Hindustan Times', 'national Herald', 'pioneer', 'mumbai-mirror' in India used to come out in English, in which there was no mention of those atrocities
 in angreji patron ke atirikt bangala, urdu aadi main patron kaa prakaashan to hota rahaa, lekin uskaa dayera simit tha
 Only a Bengali reader or a person who knew Urdu could understand it
 aise main pehali baar 30 may 1826 ko hindi kaa pratham patr ‘udant martand’ kaa pehla ank prakashit hua
 This letter was weekly
 ‘udant-martand' kii shuruyaat ne bhashaayi str par logon ko ek sutara main baandhane kaa prayaas kiya
 It was not just a letter, but the tongue of thousands of people who were still silent and frightened
 hindi main patron kii shuruyaat se desh main ek krantikari parivartan hua or aazaadee kii jang
 They were twisted and presented so that the news of the atrocities of the British Government would be suppressed
 angrej sipaahi kisi bhi kshetra main ghuskar manamaana vyavhaar karte the
 Incidents like robbery, murder, rape were common
 wo jis bhi ksheko bhi ek nai disha mili
 Now people started getting information about the events happening in the corner of the country
 lekin kuch hi samay baad is patr ke sampadak jugal kishor ko sahaayta ke abhaav main 11 disambar 1827 ko patr band karnaa padaa
 On 10 May 1829, the Hindi newspaper Bangdoot was published from Bengal
 yah patr bhi logon kii aawaaj bana or unhen jode rakhane kaa madhyam
 After this, in July 1854, Shyamsunder Sen published the 'samachar Sudha Varshana' from Calcutta
 us dauraan jin bhi akhabaaron ne angreji hukumat ke khilaaf koi bhi khabar yaa aalekh chapa, use uski keemat chukaani padi
 Newspapers were banned
 uski pratiyaan jalawaai jaati thim, uske prakashkon, sampadakon, lekhakon ko dand diya jaataa tha
 He was fined heavily so that he could not muster the courage to rise again
 aazaadee kii lahar jis tarah puure desh main fail rahi thi, akhbaar bhi atyaacharon ko sahakar or mukhar ho rahe the
 This was the reason that after partition of Bengal, the voice of Hindi letters became more elevated
 lokmaanya tilak ne 'kesari' kaa sampadan kiya or lala lajpat raay ne punjab se 'vande maataram' patr nikaala
 These letters called for greater cooperation in the freedom struggle of the youth
 in patron ne aazaadee paane kaa ek jajba paidaa kar diya
 'kesari' was removed from Nagpur by Madhavrao Sapre, but the letter was banned due to Tilak's provocative articles
 uttar bharat main aazaadee kii jang main jaan phunkane ke liye ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee ne 1913 main kanpur se saptahik patr 'pratap' kaa prakaashan aarambh kiya
 It used to publish information about atrocities in every part of the country
 isse logon main aakrosh bhadakne laga tha or ve british hukumat ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye or bhi utsahit ho uthe the
 In view of its aggression, the British administration gave various harassment to its writers and editors, but this paper remained on its target
 isi prakaar bengal, bihar, maharashtra ke kshetron se patron kaa prakaashan hota rahaa
 Those letters tried to spread the urge for people to gain freedom and spread awareness
 agar yah kaha jaae ki swatantraaa senaniyon ke liye ye akhbaar kisi hathiyaar se kamatar nahin the, to koi atishyokti nahin hogi
 The freedom weapon of the newspaper became as independent and outspoken as the press is today, it was bound by restrictions and restrictions in the freedom struggle
 na to usamen manoranjan kaa put tha or na hi ye kisi kii kamai kaa jariya hi
 These newspapers and magazines were a weapon and medium of freedom fighters, which kept them connected to people and events
 aazaadee kii ladaai kaa koi bhi aisa yoddha nahin tha, jisane akhabaaron ke jariye apni baat kehane kaa prayaas na kiya ho
 Gandhiji also published newspapers in the name of 'harijan', 'young-india', while Maulana Abul Kalam Azad published 'al-hilal'
 aise or kitne hi udhaaharan hai, jo yah sabit karte hai ki patr-patrikaon kii aazaadee kii ladaai main mahati bhoomika thi
 This was a period when people had no means of communication
 us par bhi angrejon ke atyaacharon ke shikaar asahaay log chupchaap saare atyachar sehate the
 Neither one was going to listen to them nor to defeat their sorrows
 wo kehete bhi to kisase or kaise? har koi to usee pratadna ko jhel rahe the
 In such a situation, the introduction of magazines and magazines gave courage to the people, and encouraged them
 yahi kaaran tha ki krantikariyon ke ek-ek lekh janata main nai sphurti or deshbhakti kaa sanchaar karte the
 When Bharatendu's play 'bharat-plight' was published, people got to experience how the people of India are going through and what is the intention of the British

 navyan buddha dharm kaa ek sampradaay hai, jo bhartiya buddha netaa bhimrao ambedkar dwaara nirmit hai
 Navayana means "new path" or "pure vehicle"
 is buddha dharm ke saare anuyaayi "ambedakarwaadi buddha" hote hai, in baudhon kaa ambedkar dwaara nirdharit baees pratigyaaon kaa paalan anivaary tathaa mahatvapurn mana jaataa hai, jo ambedkar ne 14 aktubar 1956 ke dharm parivartan samaaroh di thi
 These convert Buddhist followers of Ambedkar have been named as "navabodh" by the Government of India and other state and state governments
 navyan sampradaay mahayan, therwaad or vajrayan aadi kuch maamalon main bhinn hai kintu isamen in teenon sampradaayon main se buddha ke mul siddhanto ke saath keval vigyaanvaadee evam tarkshuddh / tarksangat siddhanton ko hi liya gaya hai
 Caste system, apartheid, gender discrimination, superstition and malpractices have no place in the Navayana
 2011 ke anusaar, kul bhartiya baudhon main adhikansh yani 87% hissaa navayani baudhon kaa hai
 According to other estimates, the population of Navyani Buddhists in India ranges from 5 to 7 crores in India
 ambedkar ko buddha dharm kaa swikaar karne se ek din purv patrkaar ne poocha kii, ‘aap jo buddha dharm apnaane vaale he wo mahayan buddha dharm hoga yaa hinayan buddha dharm ?’ uttar main ambedkar ne kaha kii, ‘‘meraa buddha dharm na to mahayan hoga or na hi hinayan hogaan, in donon sampradaayon main kuch andhvishwasi baaten hai isliye meraa ye buddha dharm navyan buddha dharm honga
 In which the basic principles of a Buddha and only the rational principles will be there, there will be no malicious or superstitious beliefs
 yah ek ‘shuddh buddha dharm’ honga
 The journalist then asked, "can we call it 'bhimayan'?" Ambedkar said, you can say but i will not say
 kyonki main khud ko gautam buddha ke samaan nahin laana chahta
 However, the Buddhist elements of Indian Navyani Buddhism pay respect to Ambedkar and Gautama Buddha, because they consider Ambedkar as their spiritual leader and Buddha as their mentor
 vartmaan bharat main jab-jab bhagwaan buddha ko samaran kiya jaataa he, tab-tab swaabhaavik rup se bhimrao ambedkar kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 After Indian independence a large number of communal Buddhist Dhamma converts took place under the leadership of Dr
 Ambedkar
 14 aktubar, 1956 ko nagpur main yah diksha sampann hui, jisamen ambedkar ke 5,00,000 samarthak buddha bane he, agle din 2,00,000 evam tisare din 16 oktober ko chandrapur main 3,00,000 anuyaayi buddha bane
 In this way, more than 10 lakh people had made Ambedkar a Buddhist in just three days
 is ghatana se bharat main buddha dharm kaa punarutthan yaa punarjanm hua
 By March 1959, it was estimated that 1
5 to 2 crore people had become Buddhists
 buddha dharm bharat ke pramukh dharmon main se ek he tathaa anaupchaarik rup se bharat kaa tisra sabase bada dharm he
 Lord Buddha and his Dhamma are the scriptures of Indian Buddhist followers, written by Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar
 iske alaava tripitak evam aadi buddha granthon ko buddha anuyaayion dwaara mahatvapurn mana jaataa hai
 i accept and will follow the teachings of the Buddha
 main hinayan or mahayan, do dharmik adeshon kii alag alag raay se mere logon ko dur rakhuunga
 Our Buddhism is a new Buddhism, Navayana
 — dow bhimrao ambedkar, shaam hotel, nagpur main 13 oktober 1956 ko press saakshaatkaar Dalits are beginning to think that the exit from Hinduism may be a better way for them as the condition of the new Buddhists has improved over the years, while the life of Hindu Dalits has not changed much despite being organized as a vote bank
 125ve ambedkar jayanti par rohit vemula kii maa or bhai ne bhi buddha dharm sweekaar kiya he
 According to the 2001 census, the population of Buddhists in the country is eight million, most of which are converted from Buddhists to Hindu Dalits
 sabase adhik 59 lakh buddha maharashtra main bane hai
 Uttar Pradesh has only about 3 lakh newborns, yet in many areas they have given up Hindu rituals
 puure desh main 1991 se 2001 ke bich baudhon kii aabaadi main 24 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 The sex ratio between Buddhists is 953 per thousand as compared to 936 among Hindu Dalits
 yah siddh karata he ki buddha pariwaron main mahilaon kii sthiti main ab tak hindu daliton kii tulana main behatar he
 This is in accordance with the high status of women in Buddhist society
 baudhon kaa yah anupaat hinduon, musalamaanon, sikh or jain kii tulana main adhik he
 According to the 2001 census, the sex ratio of girls and boys among Buddhists is 942, higher than the 938 for Hindu Dalits
 yah ling anupaat hinduon, sikh kii tulana main bahut adhik he, or jain 
 It is in comparison with Hindu Dalit families that girls are the result of better care and protection among Buddhists
 buddha anuyaayion kii sakshartaa dar 72
7 pratishat he jo hindu daliton kii tulana main bahut adhik he
 Even at this rate, it is more than that of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, it is found that Buddhism is more literate than Hindu Dalits
 buddha mahilaon kii sakshartaa dar ke rup main hindu dalit mahilaon ke 41
9 pratishat kii tulana main 61
7 pratishat he
 This rate is also higher than Hindus and Muslims
 yah buddha samaaj main mahilaon kii sthiti ke anusaar he
 This suggests that women among Buddhists are becoming more educated than Hindu Dalit women
 baudhon ke liye yah dar 40
6 pratishat sabase adhik he jo hindu daliton ke liye adhik se adhik 40
4 pratishat he
 This rate is also higher than Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and Jains
 yah sabit karata he ki buddha dharm hindu daliton se bhi adhik karyrat hai
 This shows that Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, the leader of the exploited and downtrodden, had accepted the great Buddhism for the upliftment or progress of the Dalits
 tathaa anyo ko bhi buddhavaad sweekaar karne kii salaah di 
 And it is well established in defeating Dalits
 haalanki, aaj daliton ke chote hisse ne hi buddhavaad apanaaya hai, or ye buddha samooh hindu daliton se behatar or sabase behatar ban rahaa hai
 More than 95% of Indian Buddhists are Navyani Buddhists
 2011 kii bhartiya janaganna ke anusaar bharat main ‘adhikrut’ buddha kareeb 85 lakh 0
7% hai, lekin anya surveykshan or buddha vidwaanon ne anusaar bharat main 5% se 7% yaa 6 karod se 8 karod buddha hai

 san 1845 main frederick vohalar ne is dhaatu ke taiyaar karne main potacium dhaatu kaa prayog apchaayak ke rup main kiya
 He found some small particles of this metal, after examining which he told that this new metal is very light and its wires can be pulled
 tadnantar sodium or sodium aluminium chloride kaa prayog karke san 1854 main devil ne is dhaatu kii acchhee maatra taiyaar kii
 Being a new metal at that time, aluminum was counted among precious metals and was used in decorations and ornaments
 san 1886 main ohayo nagar main chalrs martin haul ne gale hue cryolite main alumina ghola or usamen se vidyudvishleshan vidhi dwaara aluminium dhaatu pruthak kii
 In the same year in Europe also, HERO independently made this metal in this way
 yahi haul-hero-vidhi aajkal is dhaatu ke utpaadan main vyavahrut ho rahi he
 Since it is lighter and cheaper, the prevalence of aluminum and alloys has been increasing since then
 aluminium dhaatu taiyaar karne ke liye do khanijon kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 One is bauxite and cryolite
 bauksite ke vistrut nikshep bharat main ranchi, palamu, jabalpur, balaghat, selem, belgaum, kolhapur, thana aadi jilon main paae gaye hai
 The permitted quantity of this mineral in this country is 28 million tonnes
 aluminium dhaatu taiyaar karne ke nirmitt pehla praytn yah kiya jaataa he ki bauksite se shuddh alumina mili
 a method of purification of bauxite is named after the Bayer method
 isamen bauksite ko garam castic soda ke vilyan ke saath abhikrut karke sodium aluminute bana lete hai
 This aluminate solution is filtered and the alumina is precipitated from it
 
 Aluminum metal from alumina is prepared by hall-hero method
 vidyudvishleshan ke liye jis cell kaa prayog kiya jaataa he vah ispaat kaa bana ek bada baksaa hota he, jiske bheetar carbon kaa astr laga rahata he
 This lining of carbon is prepared by heating a mixture of coke, pitch and coal tar
 isi prakaar carbon ke dhanagar bhi taiyaar kiye jate hai
 They are often 12–20 inches long rectangular
 ye dhanagar ek samvahak dand se latakate rahete hai or icchaanusaar upar neeche kiye ja sakate hai
 The electrolytes carry the dissolved cryolite inside the cell and the electromagnet controls such that the cryolite remains in an evenly damped state by the heat of its flow
 vidyudvishleshan hone par jo aluminium dhaatu banati he vah cryolite se baari hoti he, at: cell main neeche baith jaati he
 This metal acts as a minus
 gali hui dhaatu samay-samay par cell main se baahar baha lee jaati he
 Alumina is added in the cell as needed
 cryolite ke galnaank ko kam karne ke liye isamen bahudhaa thodaa sa calcium floride bhi mila dete hai
 It is notable that the success of an aluminum metal factory depends on cheap electricity

 Caustic soda, caustic potash, and baryta have a strong effect on aluminum metal, but calcium hydroxide is not high
 aluminium oxijan ke prati adhik kriyasheel he
 Due to this property, this metal is used in the reduction of many oxides
 goldshmit kii thermite yaa taapan vidhi main aluminium churna kaa prayog karke louh, manganeez, chromium, malibdynum, tangston aadi dhaatuen apane oxidon main se pruthak kii jaati hai
 In 1926 AD, Bengf and Sutton devised a method by which a plate of oxides on aluminum metal is formed so that the metal beneath it is protected from corrosion
 yah kaary vidyuddhara kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he
 Put the aluminum vessel in the solution of 3 percent chromic acid by making it rich

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 bhairav prasad gupt ne apane jivan kaa ek pramukh bhaag sampadan ke prati samarpit kiya
 In the history of Hindi literature, more importance is given to his editor form than his author form
 'maaya' evam 'manohar kahaniyaan' se lekar 'nayi kahaniyaan' tak unhone sampadan ke anek kirtiman banaaye
 As an editor, Bhairav prasad Gupta started his career in 1944 by working in the editorial department of Mitra Publications magazines - 'maya' and 'manohar Kahaniyan'

 He lived there until 1953
 iske baad apane duusare daur main bhi san '75 se '80 ke bich unhone iske sampadakeey vibhaag main kaary kiya

 In this regard, he himself wrote: kahani patrika se mukt hote hi unhone raajakmal prakaashan se prakashit hone vaali 'nayi kahaniyaan' kaa sampadan sanbhaala
 In fact, while staying in his 'kahani' magazine, Rajkamal's then managing director Om Prakash was planning to launch a story-focused magazine, and as a competent editor, Bhairav prasad Gupta was by far the best suited for this task
 atah 'kahani' patrika se mukti ke din hi unhen raajakmal prakaashan dilli se omprakash kaa taar mila, jisamen unase kahin or niyukti na lene kaa anurodh kiya gaya, kyonki agle din hi ve baat karne ke liye elahabaad aa rahe the

 It was here that a fierce battle between the two took place when Rana Pratap and Mansingh came face-to-face - Pratap, riding on Chetak's back, placed the black-blue, Arabic-bred horse Chetak's feet on the head of the elephant of Akbar's commander Mansingh and With his spear, he made a catastrophic attack on King Mansingh, but immediately after sitting down in the elephant's strong cistern, his life was saved in this war - Huda Pratap's misdeeds and Turned badly and

 But knowing that Mansingh had not given permission to loot the city of Chittorgarh, Emperor Akbar was very angry at them and even banned their arrival in the court for some time

 Electrical circuits are formed by connecting many electrical or electronic components or components
 paripathon main ghatak do prakaar se jode ja sakate hai:shreneekram or samanantarkram main
 a circuit in which all components are connected in series can be called a parallel circuit and a circuit in which all components are connected in parallel
 shrenee paripath main harek ghatak se samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he, jabaki samanaantar paripath main harek ghatak par samaan voltata uplabdh hoti he
 Each component in the series circuits must operate, otherwise the circuit will break
 shreneekram paripathon main koi bhi ghatak kharaab hone par bhi shesh ghatak kaary karte rahenge, kintu kisi bhi ghatak ko short circuit hone par puraa paripath short-circuit ho saktaa he
 If a resistance of 10 ohms is required at some place in a circuit but it is not available but two resistors of 5–5 ohms are accessible, then they can be added in series
 isi prakaar yadi 20-20 om ke do pratirodh uplabdh hone par unhen samaantarkram main jod dene se 10 om kaa tulya pratirodh praapt ho jaataa he
 Hundreds of bulbs that can bear one and a half to two volts are added to the series and they are illuminated by 230 volts of domestic electricity
 kahin par 24 volt kii jarurat ho to 12 volt vaali do badariyon ko shreneekram main jodakar 24 volt praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Different types of components in circuits can also be connected in series or in order, for example, to protect a diode, a suitable value is fused in its series; Or a switch is inserted in its hierarchy to turn the fan on / off
 isi tarah kisi vidyut-apaghattiya sandharitra main ulti disha main voltata na lag jaye iske liye uske samaantarkram main ek diod daal diya jaataa he
 If a diode that can carry 2 ampere current can be installed at some place, then putting two ampere current carrying diodes in parallel can also work
 jab vidyut ke do yaa adhik ghatak is prakaar jode jate hai ki sabamein ek hi dhara pravaahit ho to ise shreneekram kehete hai
 That is, all the components connected in the hierarchy have a uniform current at each moment
 kintu un alag-alag ghatakon ke siron ke bich kaa vibhavaantar un ghatakon ke vidyutiya gunon par nirbhar hoti he
 For example, if three resistors of 10 ohm, 20 ohm and 50 ohm are connected in series and a 2 ampere current is flowing in the 10 ohm resistor, then 2 ampere current will be flowing in the resistors of 20 ohm and 50 ohm also
 
 kintu in teenon pratirodhakon ke vibhavaantar alag-alag honge
 Two or more 'double-headed' electrical components connected in parallel order have the same potential difference between the ends of each, but the current flowing through them can be different depending on the resistance, inductance, capacitance and other things of those components

 Let me tell you one truth; i have never passed a college; And for the first time today i have come so close to the graduation ceremony of a college
 aaj main aapako apane jivan kii teen kahaniyaan sunaanaa chaahoonga 


 zyada kuch nahin bas teen kahaniyaan
 My first story is about connecting the dots
 read college main daakhila lene ke 6 maheene ke andar hi maine padhai chhod di, par main uske 18 maheene baad tak vahaan kisi tarah aata-jaataa rahaa
 So the question arises why did i leave college? Actually, it started before i was born
 meri jaivik maan * ek yuva, avivaahit snaatakachatra thi, or vah mujhe kisi or ko god lene ke liye dena chaahati thi
 But he had a desire that only a college graduate should adopt me
 sabakuch bilkul tha or main ek vakil or uski patni dwaara apanaaya jane vaala tha ki achaanak us danpati ne apana vichaar badal diya or tay kiya ki unhen ek ladki chahie
 So at midnight, my visiting parents were called and asked, "we have a boy, would you like to adopt him?" And he quickly said yes
 baad main meri maa ko pataa chalaa ki meri maan college se paas nahin hai or pita to hai skool paas bhi nahin hai
 He therefore refused to sign the adoption papers; But after a few months, after my parents assured me to send me to college, she agreed
 to meri jindagi ki shuruyaat kuch is tarah hui or satraa saal baad main college gaya
 


 But i mistakenly chose a college as expensive as Stanford
 mere naukari pesha mata-pita kii sari jamaa-poonji meri padhai main jane lagi
 After 6 months i did not see any value in this study
 mujhe kuch samaj naheemparaha tha ki main apni jindagi main kya karnaa chahta hoon, or college mujhe kis tarah se isamen madad karegaa
 
 And above all i was spending my parents' lifetime earnings
 isliye maine college drop out karne kaa nirnay liye
 

and thought whatever would be good
 us samay to yah sab-kuch mere liye kaaphi daraavna tha par jab main peeche mud kar dekhtaa hoon to mujhe lagata he ye meri jindagi kaa sabase acha nirnay tha
 As soon as i left college, my obligation to do the required classes was over
 or main chup-chaap sirf apane hit kii kakshaen karne laga
 It was not so easy
 mere paas rahane ke liye koi kamare main nahin tha, isliye mujhe doston ke kamare main farsh pe sona padataa tha
 i used to eat from the money i got from returning the Coke bottle
 

 
main har ravivaar 7 mile paidal chal kar hare krishna mandir jaataa tha, taaki kam se kam hafte main ek din pet bhar kar khaanaa kha sakuun
 i used to like it a lot
 maine apni jindagi main jo bhi apni jigyaasa or antargyaan kii vajah se kiya vah baad main mere liye amuly sabit hua
 Here i would like to give an example
 us samay read college shaayad duniya kii sabase acchhee jagah thi jahaan kushkhat * sikhaaya jaataa tha
 Every poster, every label in the whole complex was beautifully written with hands
 chunki main college se drop out kar chukaa tha isliye mujhe saamaanya kakshaon karne kii koi zarurat nahin thi
 i decided that i would do calligraphy classes and learn it well
 maine cerriff or bina cerife prakaar-chehre ke bare main siikhaa; alag-alag akshar -sangyojan ke bich menthaan bananaa or sthaan ko ghataane -badhaane se tip kii gayi akritiyon ko khubasurat kaise banaaya ja saktaa he yah bhi siikhaa
 It was beautiful, so artistic that it could not be captured by science, and i loved it
 us samay zaraa si bhi ummid nahin thi ki main in chizon kaa upyog karen kabhi apni jindagi main karunga
 But ten years later, when we were building the first Macintosh computer, i designed it on a Mac
 or mike khubasurat typography yukt duniya kaa pehla computer ban gaya
 If i hadn't dropped out of college, i would never have had a Mac multi-typeface proportionally spaced fonts, so probably these things wouldn't have happened in any personal computer
 agar maine kabhi drop out hi nahin kiya hota to main kabhi sulekh kii wo kakshaen nahin kar paata or phir shaayad personal computer main jo phont hote hai, wo hote hi nahin
 Of course, when i was in college it was impossible to see these points in the future; But after ten years when i look back and see, everything is clearly visible
 aap kabhi bhi bhavishya main jhaank kar in binduon kojod nahin sakate hai
 You can add these points only by looking at the past; So you have to believe that what is happening right now will somehow get connected to your future
 aapako kisi na kisi cheez main vishwavaas karnaa hi hoga -apane himmat main, apni niyati main, apni jindagi yaa phir apane karm main 


 kisi na kisi cheez main vishwaas karnaa hi hoga
 

 because keep believing in this thing that later on you will be able to connect the dots which will give you the courage to listen to the voice of your heart
 

 tab bhi jab aap bilkul alag raste par chal rahe honge
 

 and that will make a difference
 bhaas sanskrit sahitya ke prasiddh naatakkaar the jinke jeevankaal ke bare main adhik pataa nahin he
 Swapnavasvadatta is the most talked about drama written by him, which is the story of a king's undying love and reunion with his queen
 kalidas jo guptakaleen samajhe jate hai, ne bhaas kaa naam apane naatak main liya he, jisase lagata he ki wo guptkaal se pehle rahe honge par isse bhi unke jeevankaal kaa adhik thos pramaan nahin miltaa
 Today, his name is mentioned as a writer in many plays, but in Trivandrum in 1912, Ganapathi Shastri saw him as Bhasa-written after seeing similarities in the writing style of the plays
 isse pehle bhaas kaa naam sanskrit naatakkaar ke rup main vismrit ho gaya tha
 Bhasa's name has been a matter of great respect among Sanskrit playwrights
 kalidas ne apane purvavarti or lokapriy naatakakaron kii charchaa karte hue sabase pehle bhaas or baad main somil evam kaviputra ke naam liye hai or unhen yashasvi naatakkaar kaha he
 He is also praised by Banabhatta, Sankatiraj and Jayadeva
 vaaman kii "kaavyalankar sutaravruti" or abhinavgupt kii "abhinavbharti", rajasekhar kii "kavyamimasaa" se bhaas ke naatakon kaa astitv suchit he
 His name also appears in "avantisundari Katha"
 at: nishchit he ki sambhavat: ashwaghosh ke parvarti or kalidas se purvavarti naatakkaar ke rup main bhaas atyant lokavishrut kalakaar the
 Bhasa was recognized as a great playwright in Sanskrit literature but his plays were not available
 san 1907 i0 main m0 m0 tii0 ganpati shastri ko malayalam lipi main likhit sanskrit ke das naatak praapt hue
 Searching found three more plays
 1912 i0 main ganpati shastri dwaara anantashyan sanskrit granthawali main bhaas ke naam se ve prakashit kiye gaye
 Many copies of these plays were obtained from other places
 ukt 13 naatakon ko purnat: yaa anshat: bhaskrut maanane / na maanane waalon ke paksh tarksamarpit hokar bhi ajtak nirnaayak nahin ho sake
 There are several reasons for this dispute to arise
 naatakon kii sthapana or pushpika main kahin bhi naatakkaar bhaas kaa naam nahin miltaa
 Most of the parts of Bhasa cited in Sanskrit texts are literally unavailable in these plays
 isi prakaar anek kaaran he jo un teraa naatakon kii bhasarachana vishyak pramanikta ko sandigdh banaate hai
 The major opinions of this topic can be put into four categories yah bhi kabhi kabhi kaha jaataa he ki bhaas ke uplabdh naatak adhure the jise anya yaa anyajanon ne puraa karke unhen vartmaan rup diya
 Whatever it is, it is certain that these plays are not fake
 kerala ke chaakaar parampara ne samaan rup se surakshit rakhaa he
 According to traditional fame, their number is said to be 23 or 30
 trivendram sanskaran ke 13 naatakon main kuch aisi samantaayein or visheshtaayen hai jinke kaaran vartmaan sanskaran kii natyalekhan or natyashilp ke kalakaar kii ekta suchit hoti he
 They begin with "nandyante tatva prasavati sutradhara:", the use of the word establishment in place of the prologue, the lack of the playwright's name, often equitably in Bharatavakya, the observance of some of Bharata's theatrical forms, the use of certain non-scriptural forms in Sanskrit, many In the plays, the resemblance of the names of some characters, the similarity of ideas and ideals, some of the characteristics of Prakrit language, etc
 are the things that have led to the unity of all of them

 par vah bhaas the yaa chaakyar naton ke natyarupantkaar, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa
 13 dramas published by Ganapati Shastri from Trivandrum in 1912 are considered Bhasakrit
 inamen pratham aath naatak anekanki hai or antim paanch ekanki hai
 The first two plays are Udyanakatharan, 3, 4 Sankhya plays are fiction stories, 5, 6 Sankhya are Ramakatharya, the seventh drama is Krishnakathasharata and the Mahabharata is the basis of plays from VIII to XIII
 inaki kathavstuon main naatakkaar ne kalpanajanya ghatnaon, paatro aadi kaa bhi naatakeeyata ke liye paryaapt upyog kiya he
 Pratimanatak is a seven-digit drama in which Bhasa places events ranging from Ram Vanagman to Ravanavadha and Ram coronation
 maharaj dasharath kii mrityu ke uparant nanihaal se laut rahe bharat ayodhya ke paas maarg main sthit devkul main purvajon kii pratimaayen dekhte hai, vahaan dasharath kii pratimaa dekhakar ve unki mrityu kaa anumaan kar lete hai
 Being an event-oriented figure, it has been named Pratima Natak
 pratimaa nirmaan kii katha bhaas kii apni moulikta he
 Bhasa has brought enough semblance to the popular Ramcharit in bringing originality to this drama
 yadhyapi ye sari ghatnayen prachlit katha se bhinn hai, par naatakeey drushti se inkaa mahatv sutraan unchaa he or pathak athwa darshak kii kautuhal vruddhi main ye ghatnayen sahaayak hui hai
 The differences in this drama from the Ramayana story are as follows - In the first issue, Sita wearing Valkal in mockery is Bhasa's origin
 tritiy ank main pratimaa kaa sampoorn prakaran hi kavi kalpit he or yah kalpana hi naatak kii aadharbhumi banaayi gayi he
 The loss of Sita in the fifth issue is also described here in a new way
 yahan ram ke utaj main vartmaan rahane par hi ravan vahaan aata he or dasharath ke shraadh ke liye unhen kanchanparshv mrug laane ko kahata he tathaa unhen kanchan mrug dikhaakar dur hataata he
 This entire episode is coined by the playwright
 paanchaven ank main sumantra kaa van main janaa tathaa lautakar bharat se sitaaharan bataanaa kavi kalpana kaa prasad he
 Kaikeyi also says that he sent Rama to the forest to make Rishivachan truth, Bhasa's phenomenon
 antatah saptam ank main ram kaa van main hi rajbhishek is naatak main moulik hi he
 The idol drama is one of Bhasa's best plays
 saat ankon ke is naatak main bhaas kii kala paryaapt oonchaain ko praapt kar chuki he
 In this play Bhasa has tried his best to show the character's climax
 itivrutt tathaa charitrachitran donon drushtiyon se yah naatak safal hua he
