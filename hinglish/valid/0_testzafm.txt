 The completion of this scripture took place in the temple of Mahalaya Devi of Saka Samvat 1212 village of Nevasse

 The union of the aforementioned two lives is called impregnation
 sansechan ke falswaroop yugmaj kaa nirmaan hota he
 Fragmentation of the zygote creates the embryo and develops into an infant form
 vrushan shukrajnan nalikaaon se bana hota he
 The endoplasm of each tube is made up of embryonic epithelium, whose multiplication and differentiation make sperm
 yah prakriya teen kramon main hoti he
 The first order is the multiplication stage, the second order is the growth phase and the third order is the mature state
 bhruneey apithilium kii sabhi koshikaaye nirmaan main sakasham hoti hai, par kuch hi usamen bhaag leti hai
 These cells are divided into geometrical proportions by necrosis
 vibhaajan se bani koshikaon ko shukranu-koshik-jan kehete hai
 Sperm-cell-masses are very microscopic
 inke andar poshak padaarth ekatrit hene se ye badhane lagate hai
 Such unclassified cells are called primary sperm cells
 ye phir paripakv avasthaa main pravesh karti hai
 Here primary sperm cells divide twice
 pratham vibhaajan ardhasuthran yaa hraas vibhaajan kaa he
 Prior to this division, the number of chromosomes present in the nucleus of the primary sperm cell is doubled, but the parental chromosomes at the time of meiosis are arranged in pairs by intercalation
 antargranthan main koi do chromosomi jode nahin banaate varan aise hi chromosome jode banaate hai jo samadharmi yaa saman shakti or rachana ke hote hai
 Thus the number of ancestral chromosomes in the meiosis becomes haploid
 koshikaaye ab dwitiya shukranukoshika ho jaati hai
 The second spermatocyte is once again divided into what is called mitosis
 isse purvashukranu banate hai, jo dhire dhire roopantarit hokar shukranu ban jate hai
 a typical sperm has three parts - the head, middle section or cervix and tail
 vibhinn shukranuon ke sir vibhinn aakaar ke hote hai
 Most are oval, but the tip of which is crooked, crooked or any other type of paper
 inke agrim sire par nukila agrastha bhaag yaa acrosom hota he
 The middle segment is usually small and cylindrical
 punch kaa akshasutra isi main lipta rahata he
 The tail is long and thin as the filaments and moves like a flag
 yah shighratapurvak hilti-dulti rahati he, jisase veeryadrav, yaa jal main tairkar andanu main pravesh karne ke liye shukranu aage badhata he
 Eggs are produced from the cells of the ovaries
 andey kii bhi gunan avasthaa, vruddhi avasthaa or paripakv avasthaa hoti he
 Egg multiplication is formed by multiplication of some of the producing cells of the ovary
 koshikajanon main andpit ekatra hokar badhate hai or badhkar praathmik dimbkoshika banate hai
 They again degenerate and divide into two separate cells
 inamen ek bahut choti or duusari badi hoti he
 The smaller one is called the first polar body and the larger one is called the second ovary
 dwitiya dimbkoshika kaa sutaran vibhaajan hoti he
 Here too, one is small and the other is big
 badi ko paripakv yaa praudh anda or choti ko dwitiya dhruviya pind kehete hai
 The primary polar bodies are also threaded to get polarity
 dhruviya rachanaayen janan ke kaam ke liye bekaar hoti hai
 The semicircular or degenerate division is necessary because the number of zygotes formed by the combination of such genera is the same as the number of ancestral formulas required for that caste, otherwise the ancestral traits may be likely to change in the offspring
 paitruk sutron kii sankhya nishchit rakhane ke liye yugmaj jagak ke samay unka hraas vibhaajan aavashyak he
 a new organism is produced only when the egg meets the sperm
 jin praaniyon main langik janan hota he, unamem dimb or shukranu do vibhinn lingwale praaniyon main utpann hote hai
 Their conjugation is by intercourse between male and female
 sambhog ke samay dimb or shukranu nikat to aa jate hai, par shukr kaa dimb ke saath milakar ek ho janaa, arthath dimb kaa nishechan kai baton par nirbhar karata he
 Eggs are not impregnated if conditions are not favorable
 sansechan ke liye nimnlikhit paristhitiyaan aavashyak hai : The number of eggs is very small in interbreeding animals and one or a few offspring are produced at a time, but in those animals which have external impregnation, the number of eggs is more and the sperm count is more than the eggs
 Even more
 jab andon or shukranuon kaa sanyog jal main hota he, yugmajon ke liye anek baadhaayen rahati hai, jaise jal kaa taap, uski amlata yaa kshariyata, ; jal kii dhara kii gati, aasapaas ke anya jaleey praaniyon kii upasthiti ityadi
 Thus, nature maintains a large number of eggs and sperm to maintain a series of species, as many of the eggs and sperm from these majority of eggs and sperm die in an uncorrected state on account of any of the above reasons
 sansechan ke liye ek dimb ko ek hi shukranu kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The normal sperm count in ejaculated semen during one-time sexual intercourse has been estimated at 22,60,00,000
 inamen keval ek hi shukranu dimb ko sansechit karne kaa kaam karata he
 Only one egg in each ovulation originates from the ovum
 jyon hi koi kriyasheel shukranu apane hi spishij ke praani ke dimb ke sampark main aata he tyon hi vah usamen pravesh kar jaataa he
 The head of the sperm penetrates inside the egg, but its tail is broken and remains outside
 dimb main shukr pravesh kar uske andar anek ghatnaon ko uttejit karata he
 First, he blocks the entry of another sperm into the egg
 yah kaam is prakaar hota he : a type of chemical secretion is released from the outer layer of the impregnated egg, which does not attract the other sperm to the egg, or it forms a jelly-like membrane around the outside of the egg, which prevents sperm from entering
 Or a very small hole in the egg surrounded by impermeable wall, the micropyle closes as a sperm enters
 dimb main pravisht karne par shukranu nirdhaarit path se cendrak kii ore agrasar hote hue dimb ke purvakendrak se miltaa he or shukranu tathaa dimb donon hi ke purvakendrak ghulmilakar chromosome banaate hai, jo koshika dravya main swatantra pade rahete hai
 The egg now becomes a zygote
 dimb kaa centrosonom lupt ho jaataa he, par shukranu kaa centrosom do bhaagon main bant jaataa he or ek gatisheel tarku kaa nirmaan karata he
 Chromosomes take their place around the ovary of this larynx, and the embryo begins to form and begin to divide and develop the accumulated ovum
 janyuon kaa sayujya kaise hota he, isapar vichaar karne se pataa lagata he ki adhikansh dashaon main to sanyog se hi nar janyu tairte-tairte maadaa janyu ke sampark main aa jaataa he, par kuch dashaon main shukranu sidhe nirdisht lakshya kii ore badhate hai
 The reason for this is because the sperm is attracted towards a particular chemical substance
 is rasinic dravya ko dimb utpann karata he
 This is called chemical traction
 par har dasha main rasinic karshan nahin hota
 It is believed that there is a polar difference between the male population and the female population, due to which they are attracted
 aakarshan kaa vaastavik kaaran kya he, yah nishchit rup se abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 During mating, the female is usually inactive and the male develops a variety of interlocking elements to embrace the female
 kuch praaniyon main gaun lakshanik lakshan, jaise maanav nar main dadhi, muchhen or nari main inkaa abhaav kintu viksit stan kaa hona or chidiyon main vividh bhanti ke rangon se yukt par ityadi, paae jate hai
 These secondary traits are helpful in combining male and female by affecting the sense organs
 kuch praaniyon main kuch aise bhi sahaayak avyav paae jate hai, jo santan kii raksha ke liye hote hai
 After impregnation in many beings, the responsibilities of the parents cease and the zygote develops without any care, in some creatures the children take care of themselves, but in some creatures the parents take great care to protect their offspring
 Huh
 ve andey yaa bhrun kii raksha ke liye koi upyukt sthaan chunate hai
 Some also take measures to keep them tied
 iske liye ve koe kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Other animals have oviposites, in which they preserve eggs or do the same work from the tissue of a living or dead animal
 vahiin andey kaa vikaas hota or dimbh banate hai
 The eggs or eggs of some creatures stick to the mother or father
 kuch maan baap unhen galfdon main liye phirte hai, kuch shishutheliyon main, jaise crusteshia main, kuch swartheliyon main, kuch faili hui dimvahiniyon main or kuch marsupiyal theliyon main liye phirte hai
 In some beings, the coincidence of the egg and sperm is inside the mother's body and the zygotic fragmentation and development of the fetus also take place there
 bhrun ke purna viksit ho jane par shishu mata ke garbh se prasav dwaara baahar chalaa aata he
 The period of time the fetus stays in the mother's womb is called the gestation period
 is prakaar ke vikaas ko ant: vikaas kehete hai
 In some fishes, lizards and birds, the ovum is impregnated within the female's body by sexual intercourse, and the zygotic infarcted ovum is adorned with a powdery covering and comes out of the body
 bhrun kaa vikaas baahar hi hota he
 When fully grown, the child breaks the egg shell and comes out of the egg
 is prakaar ke vikaas ko bahya vikaas kehete hai
 In fish, frogs, and other animals of lower order, both the egg and sperm are ejaculated outside the body and there is a coincidence and the eggs develop in the embryo
 is prakaar sansechan bhi or vikaas bhi bahya hota he 
 Cows, buffaloes, goats, humans, etc
, in which the fetus grows inside the mother's body and the baby comes out in a living state, are called jarayus
 inke vipareet machhlee mechak, saanp, chhipakali or chidiya jaise jantu, jinamein shishu andey se baahar nikalate hai, andj kehalaate hai
 In most cases, the fetus is nourished by the mother's blood, a connective like placenta
 kuch shark machhliyaan, ainablabs, kuch chhipakaliyon or staniyon main isi prakaar kii vyavastha pai jaati he
 In some creatures, after birth or when they come out of the egg, the parents feed the newborn
 staniyon main stan hota he, jisase doodh kaa srav hota he, yah doodh navjaat shishu kaa aahaar hota he
 Saliva is secreted from the mouth of many birds, which is the food of chickens
 anyathaa chidiyaan dana chugakar shishu ke mukh main daal detii hai
 Gestation usually occurs when an adult is born, but in some animals, such as midsize and axolatal, reproduction begins at infancy
 ise asechan janan kehete hai
 The reproduction of most animals or plants is almost certain, the development of the egg depends on the season and environment
 anek chidiyon, kiton or anya praaniyon main vasant yaa greeshm ritu main janan kii kriyasheeltaa adhik hoti he
 The condition of the environment, temperature, humidity, dryness etc
 affect the physiology and also have an effect on reproduction
 bhojan ke saath hi janan kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 In animals where the environment is the same, the season is not fixed in the animals, as in the Philippine islands, some animals migrate only by climatic conditions and there are occasional, external or internal changes in the supporting gonads
 kuch praaniyon main janan jeevanaparyant chalata he, par kuch main umr kii vruddhi ke saath-saath janankriyasheeltaa mand pad jaati athwa bilkul ruk jaati he
 Most animals experience a rest period of reproductive function and then the season begins again
 aisa kram shrinkhalaa main yaa ekantaranat: hota he
 Among high quality animals, including humans, heating, menstruation or egg production are also ordered
 praaniyon ke sharir main kuch aisi granthiyaan hai, jinaki koi vaahni nahin he
 From these glands, hormones are formed, which go directly into the blood
 raktapravaah ke saath saath ye samast sharir main ghoomte hai or sharir par bhinn-bhinn prabhaav utpann karte hai
 They stimulate some organs and suppress some
 inamen piyush granthi or janangranthi kaa prajnan se bada ghanaa sambandh he 
 Some animals have both male gonads and female gonads, and sperm and eggs are produced in the same animal
 ye ubhayalingi praani hai
 In these, either chromosomes of the same type are mutually reproduced inside, called self-immobilization, or impregnate each other's eggs by eating two bisexual pairs, called self-mutation, or by eating two bisexual pairs mutually
 The eggs are impregnated, which is called the cross
 kechuen, jonken, ghonghe or hydra pichley prakaar ke udhaaharan hai
 Swayamsevachan is rarely found

 Bees lay some caged and some undescribed or unfired eggs
 sansechit andey se shramik or rani madhumakhiyaan utpann hoti hai or asansechit andey se drone yaa nar madhumakhiyaan utpann hoti hai
 In some marine creatures, such as sea urchins, scientists have made possible the production of new animals from uncultivated eggs
 mechak ke andey ko sooyee se god kar tathaa uskaa vikaas kar bangchi utpann kiya gaya he
 Thus, eggs have also been successfully induced to develop by physical and chemical methods
 yakrut krimi or tiger sailamandar main janan kii ek apurv reeti pai jaati he, jise dimbhajanan kehete hai
 In this, when the animals remain in a state of disobedience and do not become full adults, then only they start reproduction and growth

 Kavyanushasana distinguished him in the category of poets of high order

 There are three main parts of Kavyanushasana - sutra, interpretation and sodhasana vritti

 Hemachandra is his independent opinion about originality
 hemchandra matse koi bhi granthkaar nayi cheez nahin likhata
 Although Mammatka is very much similar to Hemavandraka 'kavyanushasana' with 'kaviprakash'
 paryaapt sthanon par hemachandracharyane mammatka virodh kiya he

 'kavyanushasan se kavyashasre ke pathakon kon samajane main sulabhta, sugamawa hoti he
 Mammatka 'kaviprakash' is elaborate, well organized, not accessible
 aganit tikaaen hone par bhi mammatka 'kavyprakash' durgam rah jaataa he

 peshewar gayak saamanytah kisi ek prakaar ke sangeet main apane peshey kaa nirmaan karte hai jaise shastreey yaa rock or adarsh rup se ve apane saare kariyar ke dauraan kisi swar-adhyaaapak yaa swar-prashikshak kii sahaayta se swar-prashikshan lete hai
 In its physical aspect, singing is a well-defined technique used on the lungs, which act like an air supply, or blower, a vocal instrument that acts as a flute or a tremor, the thoracic and head cavities, which Like a tube in a wind instrument, the sound acts as an amplifier and depends on the tongue which pronounces vowels and consonants in association with the palate, teeth and lips

 During passive breathing, air is inhaled along the diaphragm while exhalation occurs without any effort
 pet, aantarik antarpasleey or adho shronik peshiyaan uchhvas kii kriya main sahaayak ho sakati he
 The external intercostal, scalene, and sternocleidomastoid muscles assist in exudation
 swar rajju aawaaj kii pich main parivartan karte hai
 To keep the lips closed and generate the tone is called humming
 prayek vyakti ke gayan kii adwitiya na keval aawaaj rajjuon ke vaastavik aakaar va banaavat ke kaaran hi nahin hoti balki us vyakti ke shesh sharir ke aakaar or banaavat par bhi nirbhar hoti he
 The thickness of a man's vocal cords can be loosened, tightened or changed and air can flow through them with varying pressure
 vaksh or gardan kaa aakaar, jeebh kii sthiti or anyathaa asambandhit peshiyon ke tanaav ko badla ja saktaa he
 When any of these actions occur, the pitch, volume, rhythm or tone of the voice produced changes
 dhwani sharir ke vibhinn bhaagon main bhi pratidhwanit hoti he or ek vyakti kaa aakaar or haddiyon kaa dhaancha us vyakti dwaara utpann dhwani ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Singers can also learn to present the voice in such a way that it can resonate better in their vocal system
 ise mukhar pratidhwanikaran ke naam so janaa jaataa he
 a major effect on vocal tone and production is through the function of the vocal instrument, which people use in different ways to produce different types of vowels
 swar yantra ke in bhinn prakaar ke kaaryon kaa bhinn prakaar kii mukhar panjiyon ke rup main varnan kiya jaataa he
 For this success, the method used by singers uses the singer's format, which has been found to be particularly compatible with the most sensitive part of the ear's frequency range
 saanchaa:vocal registrationmukara panjikaran maanav kii aawaaj ke bheetar sthit mukhar registeron kii pranali ko sanderbhit karata he
 The register of the human voice is a series of special notes, which are produced in the same vibrations as the vocal cords and have a similar quality
 panjiyon kaa mul swar yantra ke kaary main hota he
 They occur because vocal cords have the ability to produce many different types of vibrations
 kampan ke ye prakaar pichon ke ek vishesh daayre main prakat hote hai or khaas tarah ke swar utpann karte hai
 The word "register" can be somewhat misleading because it embodies many aspects of the human voice
 panji shabd kaa prayog nimna main se kisi ke sandarbh main bhi kiya ja saktaa he: In linguistics, a registered language is a language that combines voice and vowel into a single phonological system
 vaak rogavigyaan main shabd mukhar panji ke teen tatv hote hai - swar rajjon kaa koi nishchit kampan prakaar, pichon kii koi nishchit shrankhla or koi nishchit prakaar kii aawaaj
 Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers - vocal fry register, modal register, falsetto register, and whistle register based on the physiology of laryngeal function
 yahi najariya kai mukhar shikshavidon ne bhi apanaaya he
 Vowel resonance is a process by which the tone or depth of the original product of the vocalization process is enhanced by air-filled cavities as it passes through them to the outer air
 pratidhwani kriya se sambandhit kai shabdon main dhwani-vistaaran, prachurikaran, vistaar, sudhaar, tivrikaran or dirghikaran shaamil hai, haalaanki pakke vaigyanik prayog ke liye swar ke adhikari unamem se adhikansh par prashn chinh lagaate hai
 The main conclusion to be drawn from these words by a singer or speaker is that the end result of the resonance should be a better voice
 sharir main saat aise kshetra hai jinhen sambhavit swar pratidhwanikaarakon ke rup main soochibaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 These areas are in the series from the lowest position in the body to the topmost position, the thoracic, vaginal tree, larynx, larynx, buccal cavity, nasal cavity and sinus
 vaksh swar or sheersh swar mukhar sangeet main prayukt pad hai
 These terms are used extensively in oral vocal pedagogies and currently there is no stable opinion among vocal music professionals about these positions
 vaksh swar kaa prayog swar kii seemaa ke kisi vishesh bhaag yaa swar panji ke kisi vishesh prakaar - swar gunjan kshetra, yaa vishisht swar taal - ke sambandh main kiya ja saktaa he
 The top vowel can also be used to refer to a particular part of the vowel range or type of vowel register or the vowel resonance area
 vaksh swar or sheersh swar padon kaa pehla likhit sandarbh 13veen shatabdi ke aas-paas miltaa he, jab johans di garlandia or jerome of moravia naamak lekhakon dwaara ise gale ke swar se alag pahachaanaa gaya
 These verses were later incorporated into the Italian opera singing method called Bel Canto, in which the chest voice was ranked the lowest and the highest of the top and top of the three vocal registers - chest, passage and top register
 yah baat aaj bhi kuch swar shikshavidon dwaara padhai jaati he
 According to another method based on the Bel Canto model prevalent nowadays, the male and female vowels are divided into three registers
 purushon ke swaron ko vaksh panji, sheersh panji or phalsato panji main or striyon ke swar ko vaksh panji, madhya panji or sheersh panji main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 These academics say that the head register is a vocal technique used in singing to describe the hum felt in the singer's head
 lekin pichley do sau varshon main maanav ke sharirkriya vigyaan kii jaankaree or gayan or swar ke utpaadan kii bhautik kriya kii samaj main vruddhi hui he
 As a result, many linguists such as Ralph Appelman of the University of Indiana and William Vennard of the University of Southern California have redefined the use of thoracic and head voice terms or ceased to use them
 khaas taur par vaksh panji or sheersh panji padon kaa prayog vivaadaaspad ho gaya he kyonki swar panji ko aajkal swar tantra kii kriya ke utpaada ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo ki vaksh, fefdon or sir ke sharirkriyavigyaan se asambandhit he
 For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is nonsensical to talk of registers originating in the chest or head
 ve kehete hai ki in kshetron main mahasoos hone vaale kampan pratidhwaniyaan hai or unka varnan panjiyon kii bajaay swar ke gunjan se sambandhit padon main kiya janaa chaiye
 These vocalists prefer the use of chest voice and head voice in place of register
 is najariye ke anusaar jin samasyaon ko log panji kii samasyaayein maanate hai ve darasal pratidhwani ke samanjan kii samasyaayein hai
 This approach also harmonizes with the views of other academic fields studying vocal registers, including speech pathology, phonology and linguistics
 haalaanki dono hi vidhiyaan abhi bhi prayog main hai, phir bhi vartmaan swar shikshavid vyavsaay nae adhik vaigyanik najariye ko apnaanaa pasand karata he
 Yes, some vocal pedagogists use the views of both perspectives
 vaksh swar shabd kaa samakaleen prayog akasar kisi vishisht swar varna yaa swar ke taal ke sandarbh main hota he
 In classical singing, its use is entirely confined to the lower part of the modal register or the normal voice
 gayan ke anya prakaaron main vaksh swar ko akasar samooche modal panji main prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Vaksha Sur can add astonishing line of vocals to the expressive palette of the singer's voice
 lekin vaksh main oonche swaron ko utpann karne kii koshish main oonchi panjiyon main adhik balashaali vaksh swar kaa prayog balaprayog utpann kar saktaa he
 The use of force can eventually result in loss of voice
 saanchaa:vocal rangeyuropiya shastreey sangeet or apera main, swaron kaa prayog sangeet ke vaadyon kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 Lyricists who write vocal music are required to recognize the skills and vocal qualities of singers
 swar vargeekaran ek prakriya he, jiske dwaara maanviya gayan swaron kaa moolyankan karke unhen vibhinn swar prakaaron kaa naam diya jaataa he
 These qualities include vowel scope, vowel weight, vowel tacithera, depth of vowel and vowel change points such as vowel break and lift etc
 anya dhyaan dene yogya baton main bhautik gun, vakstar, vaigyanik pareekshan or swar panjikaran shaamil hai
 The science of vocal classification developed in European classical music has lagged behind adaptations from more modern types of singing
 apera main swar vargeekaran kaa prayog akasar bhavi swaron ko sambhavit bhoomikaaon se jodne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 There are many different systems in classical music today, including the German Fak system and the choral music system
 koi ek pranali na to sabhi sthanon main lagu he or na hi sweekrut he
 Yet most classical music systems recognize seven different main vocal types
 striyon ko teen samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya he - sopraano, mezo-sopraano or kantralto
 Men are generally divided into four groups - countertinor, tenor, baritone, and bass
 tarun hone ke pehle kii umr vaale bacchon kii awaajon par dhyaan dete samay ek aathven pad, trable, kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each of these main types has several subtypes that identify specific vocal qualities such as the coloratura feature and the weight of the voice for differentiation of voices
 is baat par dhyaan dena chaiye ki coral sangeet main, gayakon ke swar keval aawaaj kii gaharaai ke aadhaar par bante hote hai
 Choral music divides most vocal parts into higher and lower voices, or soprano, alto, tenor and bass) in each gender
 parinamswaroop, adarsh coral sthiti main durvargeekaran ho jane kii bahut sambhaavnaaen hoti hai
 Since the voice of most people is moderate, they should give either a very high or a very low part to them; The mezzo-soprano should sing the soprano or alto and the baritone should sing the tenor or bass
 prayek vikalp gayak ke liye kathinaayeeyaan prastut kar saktaa he, lekin adhikansh gayakon ke liye neeche ke sur main gane main oonche sur main gane kii apeksha kam khatra hota he
 Contemporary types of music are categorized according to the music they sing, such as jazz, pop, vloose, soul, country, folk, or rock styles
 vartmaan samay main gaiyr-shastreey sangeet main koi aadhikarik swar vargeekaran nahin he
 Attempts have been made to use classical vowel types in other forms of singing, but such efforts have become controversial
 swar ke prakaaron ke vargeekaran kaa vikaas is bharose par kiya gaya tha ki gayak shastreey swar takanic kaa prayog ek khaas daayre main rahakar bina vistaarit swar utpaadan ke saath karegaa
 Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to settle into specific vocal roles, the use of terms such as soprano, tenor, baritone can be misleading or inaccurate
 gayan ke adhyaapan ke adhyayan ko swar shikshashastra kehete hai
 The art and science of vocal pedagogy has a long history that began in ancient Greece and continues to develop and change to this day
 swar ke shikshashastra kii kala or vigyaan kaa vyavsaay karne vaale peshon main swar prashikshak, coral nirdeshak, mukhar sangeet shikshakon, opera nirdeshak or gayan ke anya adhyaaapak shaamil hai
 The principles of vocal pedagogy are part of the development of appropriate vocal technique
 adhyayan ke liye adarsh kshetron main nimna shaamil hai: Singing performed with appropriate vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated action that effectively combines the physical processes of singing
 maukhik swar ke utpaadan main chaar bhautik prakriyaaon kaa prayog hota he - shwasan kriya, swar utpaadan, pratidhwani or uccharan
 These processes occur in the following series: yadhyapi ye chaaron prakriyaayein adhyayan ke samay alag-alag padhi jaati hai, vastav main ve ek sanyojit kaary main mili hoti hai
 With an influential singer or speaker, the listener's attention is never directed towards the process that takes place in it, because the mind and body are adjusted in such a way that the listener only takes care of the integrated work that results from it
 is prakriya main samaayojan kii kami hone par kai swar sambandhi samasyaayein utpann hoti hai
 Since singing is an adjusted undertaking, it is difficult to say any individual technical field and procedures without reference to other people
 udhaaharan ke liye, swar nirmaan ke bare main tabhi kah ja saktaa he jab vah shwasan kriya se judaa ho, uccharak pratidhwani ko prabhavit karte hai, pratidhavnikaarak swar rajjuon par asar daalate hai, swar rajju shwaas niyantran ko prabhavit karte hai, aadi
 Vocal disorders often interrupt a part of the adjusted process that causes the voice teacher to over-emphasize one part of the process in their student until the problem is corrected
 lekin gayan kii kala ke kuch kshetra samyojit kaaryon ke parinaamon se ki unke bare main parmparik naamon jaise swarikaran, pratidhwanikaran, uccharan yaa shwasankriya ke antargat baat karnaa kathin he
 Once the student becomes aware of the procedures used in the singing process and their functioning, then he tries to adjust them
 aprihaary rup se vidhyaarthee or adhyaaapak kisi ek prakaar kii takanic ke bare main adhik chintit ho jate hai
 Many processes can proceed at different rates leading to an imbalance or lack of adjustment
 vidhyaarthee kii bhinn kaaryon ko samyojit karne kii kshamta par sabase adhik nirbhar swar kii takanaak ke kshetra hai: Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes
 gayan ke liye adhik peshiy shakti kii jarurat nahin hoti lekin peshi ke ucch darje ke samaayojan kii jarurat padati he
 People can develop their vocals through careful and systematic practice of songs and vocal exercises
 swar shikshavid apane vidhyaarthiyon se apni aawaaj kii kasarat budhimattapurvak karne kaa nirdesh dete hai
 Singers always have to think about the kind of sound they are making and the feeling they are having while singing
 swar ke vyaayaamon ke kai uddeshy hote hai, jinamein aawaaj ko garm karnaa, aawaaj ke daayre ko badhanaa, swar ko kshithijavat or lambavat qatari main lagaana or swar kii takneekein siikhnaa jaise, legato, stacketo, gatiki kaa niyantran, tej bolnaa, chaude antaraalon par aaraam se gaanaa siikhnaa, compit dhwani se gaanaa, melisma gaanaa or swar kii trutiyon kaa sudhaar
 An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing within the natural range of your vocal range without drawing attention to changes in quality or technique
 swar shikshavid kehete hai ki koi gayak yah lakshya keval tabhi praapt kar saktaa he jab gayan ke liye aavashyak sabhi bhautik prakriyaayein prabhavi rup se ek saath kaary kar rahi hon
 Most vocal pedagogists believe in adjusting these processes to build good singing habits in the most relaxing tessitura of the voice and then gradually expand their range
 oonche yaa neeche gane kii kshamta ko prabhavit karne vaale teen ghatak hai: mckinney says, these three components can be expressed in three basic rules - when you sing high, you must use more energy, when you sing down you have to use less energy
 jab aap ooncha gaate hai, aapako adhik sthaan kaa prayog karnaa padataa he, jab aap nichle sur main gaate hai, aap kam sthaan kaa prayog karte hai
 When you sing higher, you use more depth, when you sing in lower tone, you need less depth
 gayan kii prakriya sharir kii kuch khaas bhautik dashaon kii upasthiti main sarvottam kaary karti he
 The ability to freely pull and exhale air into the body and receive the required amount of air can be severely affected by the posture of different parts of the respiratory process
 vaksh kaa bheetar dabaa hona fefdon kii kshamta ko simit kar detaa he or sakht pet madhyapat ko neeche kii ore aane se roak saktaa he
 Good posture allows the respiratory process to perform its basic function smoothly without wasting energy
 acchhee mudra swar nirmaan ko shuru karnaa or pratidhwanikaarakon kii tuning ko aasaan banaati he kyonki sahi sangyojan sharir main anaavashyak tanaav utpann hone se roktaa he
 Vocal academics have also observed that when singers adopt a good posture, they feel more confident while singing
 shrota bhi acchhee mudra vaale gayakon ke prati behatar pratikriya karte hai
 Habitually good posture ultimately improves overall health of the body by better blood flow and saving the body from fatigue and stress
 adarsh gayan mudra ke aath ansh hote hai: There are three stages of natural respiration, inhalation, exhalation, and resting, these states are generally not consciously controlled
 gayan main shwasan kriya kii chaar avasthaaen hoti hai, bheetar saans kheenchna, niyantran banane kii avadhi, ek niyantrit uchhavas avadhi or ek punarvaas avadhi
 These stages should be under the control of the singer until they become reflex actions
 kai gayak sachet niyantranon ko unke prativarti kriyaaon main badalane ke pehle hi chhod dete hai, jisase antatogatva dirghakaalik swar kii samasyaayein utpann ho jaati hai
 Vibrato is used by singers when a continuous tone moves rapidly and continuously up and down the pitch, causing a slight vibration in the tone
 wibrato kisi anwarat sur main ek lahar hoti he
 Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breathing support and a voice instrument working in a relaxed state
 kuch gayak wibrato kaa prayog abhivyakti ke rup main karte hai
 Many successful artists have built their careers on the foundation of deep, abundant vibrato
 mukhar sangeet ek yaa adhik gayakon dwaara, saajon ke saath yaa bina saajon ke, prastut sangeet hota he, jisamen gayan kaa mukhya bhaag hota he
 Vocal music is perhaps the oldest form of music, as it requires no instruments other than the human voice
 sabhi sangeet samskritiyon main kisi prakaar kaa mukhar sangeet paaya jaataa he or sampoorn vishwa kii sabhi samskritiyon main gayan kii dirghakaalik paramparaayen rahi hai
 Music that uses singing but does not feature it predominantly is generally considered as instrumental music
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch bluez rock geeton main sade bulaave-va-pratikriya vaale kores ho sakate hai, lekin geet main saaj se utpann dhunon par adhik jor hota he
 Vocal music ideally introduces sung words called lyrics, although there are also examples of vocal music that are rendered without using words or voices without language - sometimes as an onomotopia of music
 has gone
 geet ke saath gaae hue kisi bhi mukhar sangeet ke chote se tukade ko gaanaa kehete hai
 Vocal music is written in many different ways and styles that are often given the name of a particular genre
 in vidhaon main shaamil hai: kala sangeet, lokapriy sangeet, parmparik sangeet, kshetreey or rashtriya sangeet or in vidhaon ke mishran
 These main genres have several sub-genres
 udaa
 lokapriy sangeet main bluez, jaaz, deshi sangeet, izi licening, hip hop, rock sangeet or kai anya vidhaaen shaamil hai
 One sub-genre may also have another sub-genre, such as vocals and jazz singing in jazz
 kai aadhunik pop sangeet samoohon main, ek mukhya gayak gane ke praathmik suron yaa dhun kii prastuti karata he or koi or gayak gane ke parshv main gayan yaa swarasangati kaa kaary karata he
 The previous singers sing some, but not usually complete, parts of the song and often act like humming in the background of the song
 paanch bhaagon vaala gospel kapela sangeet iskaa ek apwaad he, jisamen mukhya aawaaj paanch awaajon main se sabase oonchi hoti he or vah geet kaa nahin, balki, utaar-chadhaav kaa gayan karti he
 Some artists perform both main and previous vocals by covering recorded music in audio recordings
 lokapriy sangeet main kai mukhar swar sheliyaan shaamil ho sakati hai
 Hip-hop uses rapping, in which the lyrics are rendered rhythmically without any collaboration on a beat
 kuch prakaar kii reping main jamaikai toasting kii tarah, puri yaa adhikansh bolchaal yaa shabdon kaa uccharan hota he
 In some other types of rapping, singers may add small or incompletely sung parts
 bluez gayan blue suron ke prayog par aadhaarit hota he-aise sur jo abhivyakti ke liye mukhya sur se kam pich par gaae jate hai
 In heavy metal and hardcore punk subgenres, vocal styles may include unusual tones such as scream, scream and death roar
 lokapriy or shastreey vidhaon kii jeevant prastutiyon main ek antar yah hota he ki jabaki shastreey gayak akasar chote yaa madhyam aakaar ke haalon main bina dhwani-vistaarakon kii sahaayta ke gaate hai, lokapriy sangeet main, lagbhag sabhi prastutiyon main microphone or pie system kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, bhale hi vah kisi chote se coffee house nen bhi kyon na ho
 The use of microphones has had an impact on popular music in many ways
 ek, isse antarang or abhivyaktipurna gayan shaileyon jaise croning kaa vikaas ho sakaa he, jisamen paryaapt projection yaa aawaaj kaa utpaadan bina microphone ke sambhav nahin ho saktaa tha
 Likewise, pop singers using microphones can perform so many other vocal styles that can't happen without amplification, such as whispering, humming and mixing half-and-full tunes
 isi prakaar, kuch gayak microphone kaa prayog karke prabhaav utpann karte hai, jaise mike ko munh ke bahut paas laakar badha hua bas prabhaav praapt karnaa yaa hip-hop beetabaksaron kii tarah mike main pi or bi ke visphotak swar nikaal kar table jaisaa prabhaav utpann karnaa
 While some bands use playback singers only when they are on stage singing, playback singers have other roles in popular music
 kai rock or metal bandon main parshvik gayan karne vaale sangeetkaar vaadya bhi bajaate hai, jaise ridm guitar, electric bas yaa drum
 In Latin or afro-cuban groups, playback singers play a melody or shaker while singing
 kuch pop or hip-hop samoohon or sangeet theatre main hedset microphonon se gaate hue parshvik gayakon ko vistrut rup se taiyaar kiye gaye nrity main abhinay karnaa hota he
 There is a lot of variation in the wages and working conditions of singers
 jabaki sangeet ke anya kshetron jaise sangeet shiksha main naukariyaan purnakalik, tankhwaah vaali hoti hai, gayan kii naukariyaan ekal prastutiyon yaa pradarshnon yaa unki shrankhlaon par aadhaarit hoti hai
 Since income from singing jobs is erratic, singers often increase their income by performing other music-related work, such as singing training, singing vocals or working as a choral director in a church
 icchhuk gayakon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik hone ke kaaran, gayan main naukari paanaa bahut pratispardhaatmak ho saktaa he
 In the choir of church singers, solo singers can earn from 30 to 500 dollars
 saamudayik gayak samooh main gane vaale log 200 se 3000 dollars prati varsh tak kama sakate hai, jabaki peshewar kaarykram ke coral samooh ke sadsy prati pradarshan 80 dollars yaa adhik kama lete hai

 Classical program soloists, for whom job opportunities are very limited, earn around $ 350 or more per performance
 gayak banane ke icchhuk logon main sangeet kaa hunar, utkrisht aawaaj, logon ke saath kaam karne kii kshamta or pradarshan karne or naatakeeyata kaa shauk hona aavashyak he
 In addition, singers must have the desire and dedication to continually learn and refine, as the study of singing does not end with the completion of an initial diploma or degree — professional singers may enhance their skills even decades after their initial training ends and They try to get music training to learn new styles
 saath hi gayak banane ke icchhuk logon ko gaanon ko samajhane ke liye, apane chune hue sangeet kii style ke mukhar sahitya ko padhane or coral sangeet kii takneekon main maahir hone ke liye, drishy gayan or gaanon ko yaad rakhane, piano ke mul hunaron, nae geet seekhney main madad or kaanon ke abhyaas yaa maukhik kasaraton ke liye, mukhar takneekon main vishesh hunar praapt karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In classical singing and some other genres, knowledge of foreign languages such as French, Italian, German or other languages is required
 college or vishwavidhyalay ke prashikshan ke pehle, gayak banane ke icchhukon ko sangeet padhanaa siikhnaa, mul piano kaa adhyayan karnaa or samooh gaan va ekal donon sthitiyon main gane kaa anubhav praapt karnaa chaiye
 College and university training is not always necessary, but it is generally necessary to have equal training
 secondary skool ke baad gayan main shastreey va gairshastreey donon tarah ke gayakon ke liye prashikshan uplabdh he
 Singing in the classical category can be studied in conservatories and university music programs, with degrees ranging from diplomas and bachelor's degrees to master's degrees and Doctor of Musical Arts
 lokapriy or jaiz shaileyon main, college or university digriyaan uplabdh hai, haalaanki is tarah ke kaaryakramon kii sankhya kam he
 After completing their professional training for aspiring singers, they should take a singing test in front of an opera director, choirmaster or conductor and take steps to sell themselves to buyers of music talent
 mukhar sangeet kii jis style main vyakti prashikshit hota he, hunar ko kharidne vaale log, ricard company ke pratinidhi, apera yaa sangeet theatre ke nirdeshak, coyar nirdeshak, nite club manager yaa kancert promotor ho sakate hai
 In addition to their brief introductions reflecting their training and performance experience, singers prepare a promotional kit that contains professionally captured photos, cds or dvds of their singing performances, and copies of reviews from music critics or journalists
 
 kuch gayak saakshaatkaar or anya abhinay ke avasaron ke liye ek agent yaa manager ko bhi rakhte hai, agent yaa manager ko akasar manch par kaam karne se praapt fees kaa kuch pratishat diya jaataa he
 Scientific studies have shown that singing can have a positive effect on people's health
 coral gayan main bhaag le rahe vidhyaarthiyon ke survey se praapt swayan diye gaye byore ke anusaar kiye gaye ek praathmik adhyayan main fefdon kii kshamta main vruddhi, behatar mood, tanaav main kami or saamaajik va aadhyatmik laabh mahasoos kiye gaye
 Nevertheless, a fairly old study of lung capacity compared people with professional vocal training to those without training and found no support for claims of increased lung capacity
 gayan tanaav ko kam karke pratirodhakshmata pranali par sakaaratmak prabhaav daal saktaa he
 One study found that both singing and listening to choral music lowers stress levels and increases immunity
 2009 main gayan or swasthya ke bich sambandh kaa adhyayan karne ke liye ek bahurashtriya sahyog kii sthapana kii gai, jiskaa naam gayan main pragat antainushaasaneey shodh rakhaa gaya
 Scholars agree that singing is powerful in many non-human races
 bahut bhinn pashu jatiyon main gayan ke bartaav ke vistrut failaav se lagata he ki gayan bhinn jatiyon jaise main swatantra rup se prakat hua
 At present there are about 5400 such species of animals that can sing
 kam se kam kuch gane vaali jatiyaan apane gaanon ko seekhney, sudhaarney or nai dhunon ko banane kii kshamta kaa bhi pradarshan kar sakati hai
 Singing is a group activity in some animal castes, although only humans are a singing group that understands rhythm and can be integrated into the rhythm perfectly
 joseph jordania ne suzav diya ki gayan kaa bartaav bhinn paryaavarnon main rahane vaali pashu jatiyon main bahut hi asmaan rup se vitarit hota he
 Most singing castes live on trees, some live in water, and no animal species other than humans sing on the ground
 gayan kaa yah asmaan vitaran pashuon or manushyon ke gayan ke bartaav ke mul ko samajhane ke liye mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 Jordania explains this fact as a result of the pressure of natural selection
 gayan ek bahut hi mahangaa bartaav he na keval isaliye ki awaajon ke utpaadan main urja kharch hoti he, balki suraksha ke kaarnon se bhi kyonki sabhi sambhavit shikari gane vaale pashu ko aasaani se khoj sakate hai
 Singer castes living on trees are in a much more favorable situation because trees allow different castes to live according to their body weight
 is tarah bhinn vajan vaale bhinn jeev pedo kii shakhaon par bhinn staron par rahete hai

 a 50 kg leopard can see and hear the sounds produced by a 50 kg monkey but since the underweight monkey is quite high on the branches of the trees, it is out of reach of the overweight leopard
 isaliye ped par rahane vaali jatiyaan mukhar sanketon ke ek bade daayre main gane yaa sanchaar karne main surakshit mahasoos karti hai
 On the other hand, all the animal species that live on the land, despite large disparities in their weight, live on the same level as the land and it is very important for them to keep quiet
 adhikansh pakshi, atyant shaukeen gayak bhi jameen par baithe hone par gaanaa or anya swaron kaa utpaadan band kar dete hai
 Hence the threat of predator may be the main reason for species living on trees to make a lot more noise than those living on land

 The Telugu language is the main language and official language of the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in India
 ye dravid bhashaa-parivaar ke antargat aati he
 This language is also spoken in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Chhattisgarh apart from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
 telegu ke teen naam prachlit hai -- "telegu", "tenugu" or "andhra"
 The word Andhra is used in the Rigvedic Aitareya Brahmana
 telegu shabd kaa mularoop sanskrit main "triling" he
 It refers to the Shivalinga of Mallikarjuna Linga, Kaleshwar and Draksharama of Srisail in Andhra Pradesh
 in teenon simaaon se ghira desh trillingdesh or yahan kii bhashaa triling kahalaai
 This word is used in the Mahabharata of the Telugu Adi-poet "nannay Bhatt"

 It means this region spread in the middle range of three big mountains
 andhra janata uttar disha se dakshin kii ore jab hataai gai to dakshinvasi hone ke kaaran is pradesh or bhashaa ko "tenugu" naam diya gaya

 In Tenugu, your word means honey
 yah bhashaa madhumadhur hone ke kaaran tenugu naam se prasiddh he
 This region is also known by the name "veginam"
 "vegi" kaa arth he krishna godavari nadiyon kaa madhyadesh jo ek baar jal gaya tha
 This name is not applicable to the language
 andhra ek jati kaa naam he
 According to the legend of the Rig Veda, due to the curse of sage Vishwamitra, his 50 sons became Andhra, Pulind and Shabar

 Chilukuri Narayana Rao, the Telugu language is not of the Dravidian family but is Prakritjanya and is especially related to the Paisachi language
 iske vipareet bishap cardwell or korad ramakrishnayya aadi vidwaanon ke mat se telegu bhashaa kaa sambandh dravid parivaar se hi he
 Whatever it is, it has developed from the conference of both types of languages
 aajkal uparyukt teen naamon se prachlit is bhashaa main lagbhag 75 pratishat sanskrit shabdon kaa sammishran he
 The root cause of its sweetness is a combination of Sanskrit and Telugu
 pashchim ke vidwaanon ne bhi telegu ko "purv kii italeey bhashaa" kahkar iske maadhurya kii saraahna kii he
 Scripts for almost all sounds are found in this language
 isaki visheshta yah he ki hrasv e, o, dantya c, za evam shakat ref naam se ek adhik "r" ke atirikt ardhabindu or "l" bhi is bhashaa main he
 In this way, six letters are found more in the Telugu alphabet than in the Sanskrit alphabet
 praaia: sanskrit ke mangal, taal or kala aadi shabdon ke "l" varna telegu main "l" se uccharit hote hai
 Ardhanusvara does not exist in pronunciation, but to know the sequence of language, it is necessary to write it
 kuch shabd ek hi prakaar se uccharit hote hue bhi ardhanuswaar ke samavesh se bhinn-bhinn arth dete he
 For example, "edu" means seven numbers
 usee ko ardhanusaar se 'endu' shabd likhaa jaae to iskaa arth varsh arthath sanvatsar hota he
 Telugu Swaraant Yane is the "ajant" language while Hindi is "vyanjnant" or "halant Bhasha"
 swarant bhashaa hone ke kaaran telegu sangeet ke liye atyant upyukt maani gai he
 Thus, 90 percent of the words in Carnatic music are found in Telugu
 telegu lipi motiyon kii maala ke samaan sundar prathit hoti he
 The letters are round

 shikharji yaa shri shikharji yaa parasnath parvat bharat ke jharkhand rajya ke giridih zile main chota nagpur pathaar par sthit ek pahari he jo vishwa kaa sabase mahatvapurn jain tirth sthal bhi he
 20 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism attained salvation in this saintly region known as 'shri Sammed Shikharji'
 yaheen 23 wein tirthakar bhagwaan parswanath ne bhi nirvana praapt kiya tha
 It is believed that 20 of the 24 Jains attained salvation
 1,350 meter unchaa yah pahaad jharkhand kaa sabase ooncha sthaan bhi he
 Shikharji is an important pilgrimage site for the followers of Jainism

 The mountain descent and journey is about 18 miles
 sammed shikhar jain dharm ko maanane waalon kaa ek pramukh tirth sthaan he
 It is considered to be the best among Jain pilgrimages
 jain dharamshastron ke anusaar jain dharm ke 24 main se 20 tirthankarasn or anek santon va muniyon ne yahan moksh praapt kiya tha
 Therefore it is called 'siddhakshetra' and in Jainism it is called Tirtharaj i
e
 'king of Tirthas'
 yah tirth bharat ke jharkhand pradesh ke giridih jile main madhuban kshetra main sthit he
 It is the main pilgrimage of Jainism
 ise 'parasnath parvat' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to Jain texts, the existence of both Samamed Shikhar and Ayodhya is parallel to creation
 isliye inako 'shaashvat' mana jaataa he 
 Here in ancient texts, Tirthankaras and ascetic saints attained salvation through rigorous penance and meditation
 yahi kaaran he ki jab sammed shikhar tirthayatra shuru hoti he to har tirthayatri kaa man tirthankarasn kaa samaran kar apaar shraddha, aasthaa, utsaah or khushi se bharaa hota he
 It is written in Jainism scriptures that once a soulful pilgrimage to the Samkad Shikhar shrine in one's life, a person does not get animal vagina and hell after death
 yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki jo vyakti sammed shikhar aakar puure man, bhav or nishtha se bhakthi karata he, use moksh praapt hota he or is sansar ke sabhi janm-karm ke bandhanon se agle 49 janmon tak mukt vah rahata he
 All this is possible only when all the devotees here remember the Tirthankaras and follow the teachings, teachings and principles given by them with pure conduct
 is prakaar yah kshetra bahut pavitra mana jaataa he
 The natural violent behavior of wild animals like lions, tigers, etc
 found here is not seen due to the sanctity and sattvikta of this region
 is kaaran tirthayatri bhi bina bhay ke yatra karte hai
 It is probably because of this effect that many kings, Acharyas, Bhattaraks, Shravaks from ancient times came here with huge groups for pilgrimage in the spirit of self-welfare and salvation, worshiping Tirthankaras, meditating and performing rigorous penance
 jain niti shastron main varnan he ki jain dharm ke 24 tirthankarasn main se pratham tirthankar bhagwaan 'adinath' arthath bhagwaan rishabhdev ne kailash parvat par, 12wein tirthankar bhagwaan vasupujya ne champapuri, 22wein tirthankar bhagwaan neminath ne girnaar parvat or 24wein or antim tirthankar bhagwaan mahavir ne pavapuri main moksh praapt kiya
 The remaining 20 Tirthankaras attained salvation at Sammed Shikhar
 jain dharm ke 23wein tirthankar bhagwaan parswanath ne bhi isi tirth main kathor tap or dhyaan dwaara moksh praapt kiya tha
 Therefore, the Tonk of Lord Parshvanath is situated on this peak

 plate vivartaniki ek vaigyanik siddhanth he jo prithvi ke sthalmandal main bade paimaane par hone vaali gatiyon kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes
 yah siddhanth beesvin shatabdi ke pratham dashak main abhikalpit mahadwipiya visthaapan naamak sankalpana se viksit hua jab 1960 ke dashak main aise naveen saakshyon kii khoj hui jinase mahadwipon ke sthir hone kii bajaay gatisheel hone kii avadharana ko bal mila
 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion
 harry hes ke dwaara sagar nital prasaran kii khoj se is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan aarambh mana jaataa he or wilson, morgan, maikenzi, oliver, parker ityadi vidwaanon ne iske paksh main pramaan uplabdh karaate hue iske sanvardhan main yogadan kiya
 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries
 
 plate vivartaniki main vivartaniki shabd unani bhashaa ke τεκτονικός se bana he jiskaa arth nirmaan se sambandhit he
 The term plate was first used by Canadian geologist Wilson and the term plate tectonics was first used by Morgan
 is siddhant ke anusaar prithvi kii upree parat ke rup main sthit sthalmandal, jisamen crust or upree mantal kaa kuch hissaa shaamil he, kai tukdon main vibhajit he jinhen plate kaha jaataa he
 Generally, the number of large plates in these plates is considered seven
 iske alaava kuch majhale or chote aakaar kii plates bhi hai
 a list of these is given below: kuch vidwaan uttari america plate or dakshini america plate ko ek hi maanate hue badi platon kii sankhya chah manaate hai
 There are many variations in the number of small plates, but their number is generally accepted more than 100

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains
 europe main sarvapratham austrian edward swess ne is tarah kii sankalpana ko prachaarit kiya tha
 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains
 sankuchanavaadiyon ko pehali chunauti tabhi mili thi jab mahadwipon ke kshaitij sthaanantaran kii sankalpana kaa udbhav hua
 It was only in the early sixteenth century that scholars marked the similarity of the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean to each other
 angrez darshanik francis bekan ne pehali baar sateek nakshon ke adhyayan se yah samanta chihnit kii, maanchitr vigyaani abraham ortalius ne 1596 main pehali baar yah kaha ki america europe or africa se tut kar alag hue hai or german dharamshastri theodor lilonethal ne 1756 main ortalius ke kathan kii pushti bible ke ek kathan ke aadhaar par karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans
 wagonar ne hi sabase pehle "mahadwipiya visthaapan" shabd kaa prayog kiyawagonar ke isi siddhanth se aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa vikaas sambhav ho paaya haalaanki lagbhag aadhi sadi tak unke vichaaron ko bhi vidwaanon dwaara nakaara jaataa rahaa jab tak 1960 ke dashak main pramaan nahin uplabdh hue
 And continental displacement platon kii gatishiltaa ke kaaran inke ke kinare yaa simaayen teen prakaar ke paae jate hai: With this type of edge, the two plates move towards each other and collide them and the heavy plate is injected under the light plate
 mudakar neeche kii ore kshepit hone vaala yah hissaa gaharaai main ja kar taap or daab kii adhikta ke kaaran pighalkar megma main parivartit hota he
 The depth at which this event occurs is known as the tiller zone or Benioff zone
 aise kinaaron ke sahare bhusannatiyon ke padaarth dabaav ke kaaran mudakar parvaton kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Going down, the molten material rises up as a magma plume and also produces volcanism
 jahaan do platen ek duusare ke vipareet gatisheel hoti hai, arthath ek duusare se dur hatati hai vahaan neeche se megma upar uthakar nayi plate kaa nirmaan karata he
 The most prominent landforms found on these banks are the Central Oceanic Ridge
 jab yah kinaaraa kisi mahadweep par sthit hota he to rift ghaatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction
 plate vivartaniki siddhant valit parvaton ke nirmaan kii sabase nayi vyakhya prastut karata he
 For example, a description of the origin of the mountains of the Alpine mountain system can be presented
 is siddhant ke anusaar yah mana jaataa he ki bumadhya sagar ke uttari or dakshini ore bane parvaton kii shrunkhlaayen tershiri yug main hue vivartanik ghatnaon kaa parinaam hai jinamein tethes sagar main jamaa avsaadon ke africa or europea platon ke bich sampeden dwaara inkaa nirmaan hua
 Regarding the origin of the Himalayas, this theory holds that the origin of this range is due to the approaching of the Tibet Plate and the Indian Plate and the compression of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sagar or Bhusannati

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga vaidic dharm vaidic sabhyataa kaa mul dharm tha, jo bhartiya upmahadweep or madhya asia main hazaron varshon se chalata aa rahaa he
 Vedic Sanatan Varnashram religion or modern Hinduism is based on this religious system
 vaidic sanskrit main likhe chaar veda isaki dharmik kitaaben hai
 According to Hindu belief, the mantras of Rigveda and other Vedas were revealed to the sages by God
 isliye vedon ko 'shruti' kaha jaataa he, jabaki shrutigranthuke anusharan kar vedadwara rachaa gaya vedangadi sutara granth smriti kehalaata he
 Reminiscences composed by Vedagna Manu, Atri, Yajnavalkya etc
 are also considered as memory based on Dharmasutra under Vedang

 Apart from this, only the Vedoun Samhita Khandaka accepts the Vedas

 At the root of Vedic religion and civilization, all the civilization of Sunsar appears in one form or the other

 Similarly, the influence of many Vedic words can be found in the consonant word Zoroastrianism and ancient European religions, such as soma, yajna, pitr-father, matar-madar, bhratar-brother swasar-swishtar nakta-nite etc
 vaidic dharm main aatma kii ekta par sabase adhik jor diya gaya he

 Attraction to the Tatra: Mourning as a person jo aadmi sab praaniyon main ek hi aatma ko dekhtaa he, uske liye kiskaa moh, kiskaa shok?vaidic dharm kaa mul tatv yahi he
 God is prevalent everywhere in this world
 usee ko paane ke liye, usee ko samajhane ke liye hamen manushya kaa yah jivan mila he
 The way to get it is called religion
 dharm ke chaar lakshanmanu maharaj ne dharm ke chaar lakshan bataae hai: Veda: Smriti: Sadachara: Health f Priyamatman: etchchaturvidhan prahuh saakshada dharmasy lakshanam
 The four criteria of religion are: veda chaar hai
 There are four divisions of every Veda: Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishadindhu religion is the basic basis of Veda
 veda kaa arth he gyaan
 The word ‘veda’ is derived from the ‘vid’ metal of Sanskrit
 'vid' yani jaananaa
 Veda is also known as 'shruti'
 'shru' dhaatu se 'shruti' shabd bana he
 'shru' means listening
 kehete hai ki rishiyon ko antaratma main paramatma ke paas se aata gyaan sunai padaa
 The Vedas are four: Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 chaaron vedon main kul milakar 20389 mantra hai
 In ancient times, people in the country of India who were knowledgeable, had ethics, whose heart was generous, whose views were high, people used to call them 'sages'
 'sada jivan, ucch vichaar' unka adarsh tha
 He used to reflect on esoteric themes of religion, lead a simple and pious life and show the right path to the society
 vaidic sahitya in rishiyon kii hi pavitra dharohar he
 It used to inspire people even 5000 years ago and still gets today
 vedon main hamen bahut se devataaon kii stuti or prarthana ke mantra milte hai
 The main deities among them are: kabhi to ham sharir ko manushya kehete hai, kabhi uski aatma ko
 Similarly, Vedic sages also prayed to the gods in two forms
 kabhi jad padaarth ke rup main, kabhi us jad ke bheetar rahane vaale chetan parampara ke rup main
 For example, the word 'surya' used to mean that bright glowing shell, which we call 'surya'
 kabhi 'surya' se unka aashay hota tha, surya ke rup main prakaashmaan paramatma se
 The sages believed that the same great power was scattered as many gods
 usee kii ve stuti karte the, usee kii prarthana
 He used to worship him only
 usee ko prasann karne ke liye ve yajna karte the
 The mantras of Veda are full of beauty
 vaidic pandit jab swar ke saath veda mantron kaa paath karte hai, to chitt prasann ho uthta he
 Whoever hears the recitation of the recitation, becomes enchanted
 itnaa hi nahin, richaon main jo arth bharaa he, vah to usase bhi sundar he
 The expressions which are filled in them, are going to elevate man
 samaaj ko upar uthaane vaale hai
 They also benefit the soul and the society
 vedon ke mukhya rup se teen bhaag hai :1) karmkand, 2) gyankand or 3) upasnakand Yagya karma has been given in the ritual, so that the performer and the performer of the yajna will get happiness in the world-world
 gyankand main paramatma or aatma kaa tatv or lok-paralok kaa rahasy bataaya gaya he
 The method of god-bhajan is described in the Upasanakanda
 isse manushya ko lok-paralok main sukh mil saktaa he or ishwar kii prapti ho sakati he
 There are four divisions under the Veda: 1) Samhita, 2) Brahmin, 3) Aranyaka and 4) Upanishads
 vedon ke mul paath ko samhita kehete hai
 These are different texts of the four Vedas
 chaaron vedon kii kai shakhaaen ho chuki hai or un sabhi shakhaon ke apane-apane brahman, aaranyak tathaa upanishad rahe hai jinamein se adhikansh aajkal anuplabdh hai
 The Brahmin texts mainly discuss yajnas
 isamen vedon ke mantron kii vyakhya ke saath-saath yagyon ke vidhaan kaa vistaar se varnan he
 The main Brahmins are 4: vedon kii rachana rishiyon ne kii he
 They lived in forests, in forests
 van ko sanskrit main kehete hai 'arany'
 The texts made in Aranya got its name 'aranyak'
 mukhya aaranyak paanch hai : The last part of the Veda is named Upanishad
 upanishad shabd bana he sad dhaatu se
 Sad means to perish, and to relax
 upanishad kaa arth he brahmavidya
 Avidya is destroyed by theology, the shackles of the world are relaxed, there is joy and the sorrow of birth and death is left
 sabhi vedon kii apni-apni sabhi shakhasambaddh upanishdein hoti hai
 Today there are 108 Upanishads
 jisame acharya shankar lagaayat vidwaanke bhashya milte aise mukhya upanishdein 10 hai- ish, ken, kath, prashn, mundak, manducya, taittiriya, aitarey, chhandogya, brihadaaranyak or shwetashwarako bhi pramukh manajata he
 The practice of truth requires initiation as well as penance
 yajurveda main kaha he :- Vraten Dixamapnoti Dixayapnoti Dakshinam
 dakshina shraddhamapnoti shraddhya satyamapyate
 Fasting gives initiation, initiation gives Dakshina, Dakshina gives reverence and reverence leads to truth
 indriyon kaa sanyam
 To achieve any goal one has to do penance
 dharm ko paane ke liye bhi tap karnaa jaruri he
 Brahmacharya - The way you have to do penance in life, similarly in the future
 brahmayajnaka arth he gurumukhse anuvachan kiya hua veda-shruti vedbhaagako nity vidhiwat paath karnaa
 Chanting of Vedic mantras from the incapable of reciting is also a Brahmo yajna by customary method
 brahman vedonke jis yajna-anushtanka prasangvaala bhaag nity paath karata he usee yajyaka fal praapt karata he
 In ancient times, the person who gave Vedana was recited daily in Shuklapaksam mantra Brahmanical Vedabhaga and Krishnapaksam in Vedang-kalpa, grammar, nirukta, education, verses and astrology
 prarthana or yajyase sambandh rakhanevaala yajmaan or purohit- rutvik vaa acharya sadaacharihona chahie
 Otherwise, there is no meaning of his worship or prayer or sacrifice
 puranonme kaha bhi he- acharhina na punanti vedah yadhyapyadhita sahashadbhirangaih xxrep 4 
 | sadaachari log hi tarte hai, duraachaari nahin
 It is said in the Rigveda: - ritasya panthan na taranti dushkritah
