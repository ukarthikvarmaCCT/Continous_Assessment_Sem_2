 baad main bharat sarkaar ke videsh mantralay main hindi visheshgy rahe
 Nominated Member of the Upper Rajya Sabha
 bachchan ji kii ginati hindi ke sarvaadhik lokapriy kaviyon main hoti he
 Bachchan was born on 27 November 1907 in a Kayastha family in Babupatti, a small village in Pratapgarh district adjoining Allahabad
 inke pita kaa naam pratap narayan shrivastav tathaa mata kaa naam saraswati devi tha
 They were called 'bachchan' in childhood, which literally means 'child' or 'child'
 baad main ye isi naam se mashhoor hue
 He first studied Urdu at Kayastha Pathshala, which was then considered the first step towards a law degree
 unhone prayag vishvavidhyalay se angreji main eme or cambridge vishvavidhyalay se angreji sahitya ke vikhyath kavi dablubi yeats kii kavitaaon par shodh kar piech di puri kii 
 In 1926, at the age of 19, he was married to Shyama Bachchan, who was 14 at the time
 lekin 1936 main shyama kii tibi ke kaaran mrityu ho gai
 Five years later in 1941, Bachchan married Tej Suri, a Punjaban who was associated with theater and singing

 LC paripath main prerakatv tathaa sandharitra hote hai
 They are also called 'resonant circuits' or 'tank circuits' or 'tuned circuits'
 l or c milakar ek vaidyut anunaadi kii tarah kaam karte hai 
 LC is used to generate an electrical signal of a fixed frequency
 iske alaava ise kisi jatil sanket main se kisi nishchit aavriti ke sanket ko chunane ke liye bhi kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 For this reason LC circuits are used in many electronic devices, such as vibrators, filters, tuners, and frequency mixers in radio
 LC paripath ek adarshikrut paripath he jo is manyata par banaaya gaya he ki is paripath main pratirodh anupasthit yaa shunya he or is kaaran urja kaa hraas shunya he
 But in any practical LC circuit there will be some energy loss
 yadhyapi koi bhi paripath shuddh rup main LC nahin he phir bhi is adarsh paripath kaa adhyayan samaj viksit karne ke liye upyogi he
 z = r + j ω l + 1 / { \ displaystyle z = \ r + j \ omega l + 1 / \ , \ !} ω 0 = 1 / l c { \ displaystyle \ omega _{0}= \ 1 / { \ sqrt {LC}} \ , \ !} q = l ω 0 / r { \ displaystyle q = \ l \ omega _ {0} / r \ , \ !} y = 1 / r + 1 / + j ω c { \ displaystyle Y= \ 1 / R+1 / +j \ omega c \ , \ !} ω 0 = 1 / LC { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {0} = \ 1 / { \ sqrt {LC}} \ , \ !} q = r / { \ displaystyle Q= \ r / \ , \ !} The vibrational frequency of the LC circuit depends on the value of l and C
 kampan kii koniya aavriti nimnlikhit sutara se di jaati he
 And frequency in hertz, anunaad kii sthiti main , It is clear that if there is a circuit without energy loss aparaadh, apradhi, aapraadhik swabhaav tathaa aparaadhiyon ke sudhaar kaa vaigyanik adhyayan aparaadh shaastra ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 Under this, the attitude of society towards crime, causes of crime, consequences of crime, types of crime and prevention of crime are also studied
 samaaj jisamen vyakti rahata he, maanviya samaaj kehalaata he
 Humanitarian rules and laws in human society are made for different society to run the society
 bane hue saamaajik niyamon ko todne ko aparaadh kii shrenee main gina jaataa he
 The rules of economic, political, religious and human living in social rules are formulated according to different times and civilizations
 aparaadh jis samay maanav samaaj kii rachana hui arthath manushya ne apana samaajik sanghathan prarambh kiya, usee samay se usne apane sanghathan kii raksha ke liye naitik, saamaajik aadesh banaae
 Following the orders, the 'religion' of man was revealed
 kintu, jis samay se maanav samaaj bana he, usee samay se uske adeshon ke viruddh kaam karanevaal bhi paidaa ho gaye he or jab tak manushya pravriti hi na badal jaae, aise vyakti baraabar hote rahenge
 There has been an attempt to explain crime since ages
 atev ke
 sen ne aparaadh kii sata itihaas kaal ke bhi purv se maani he
 It is therefore difficult to explain
 purvi tathaa pashchimi deshon ke praarambhik vidhaanon ke naitik, dharmik tathaa saamaajik niyamon kaa todna samaan rup se aparaadh tha
 Sargent Santiphan has written that it is a crime to act contrary to what the majority of the community thinks is right
 bladeston kehete hai ki samue samudaay ke prati kartavya he tathaa uske jo adhikaar hai unki avagya aparaadh kaa nirnay nagar kii samoochee janata karti thi
 In today's law, crime is considered the object of 'public harm'
 do sau varsh purv tak sansar ke sabhi deshon kii yah nishcitt niti thi ki jisane samaaj ke adeshon kii avagya kii he, usase badla lenaa chahie
 That is why the criminal was tortured a lot
 jelon main uske saath pashu se bhi bura vyavhaar hota tha
 This feeling has changed now
 aaj samaaj kii nishchit dharna he ki aparaadh, shaareerik tathaa maansik donon prakaar kaa rog he, isliye apradhi kii chikitsa kerani chahie
 It has to be returned by making a decent, civilized, moral citizen while returning to society
 atev karagaar yatnaa ke liye nahin, sudhaar ke liye he
 It became clear that if crime is the name of defiance of moral and social orders, then the word cannot be given any definite meaning
 frid varg ke viddhan prayek aparaadh ko kamvasana kaa parinaam batalaate he tathaa hili jaise shastri use saamaajik vaataavaran kaa parinaam kehete hai, kintu ye donon mat maanya nahin he
 There is not a single type of religion in a country
 har ek main ek hi prakaar kaa saamaajik sanghathan bhi nahin he, rahan sahan main bhed he, aachaar vichaar main bhed he, aisi sthiti main ek desh kaa aparaadh duusare desh main sarvatha uchit aachaar ban saktaa he
 Somewhere it is a valid thing to divorce a woman, elsewhere it is completely forbidden
 kahin par sanyukt parivaar ke jivan uchit he, kahin par paariwaaki jivan kaa koi kanoonee niyam nahin he
 In 1946–47, those who committed thieves in England were severely punished, in France it was considered an 'ordinary' thing
 kai desh dharmik rup se kiya gaya vivaah hi vaid maanate he
 In Eastern Europe and many other literary countries, marriages done by religious practice have no legal significance
 sanyukt rashtrasang ne bhi aparaagh kii vyakhya karne kii cheshtaa kii he or usne bhi keval 'asaamaajik' athwa 'samajavirohi' kaaryon ko aparaadh sweekaar kiya he
 But this cannot create a worldwide moral and crime related legislation
 mote taur par sach bolnaa, chori na karnaa, duusare ke dhan yaa jivan kaa apharan na karnaa, pita, mata tathaa gurujanon kaa aadar, kamvasana par niyantran, yahi moulik naitikta he jiskaa har samaaj main paalan hota he or jiske vipareet kaam karnaa aparaadh he
 Dr
 Lambrozo of Italy was the first scribe who tried to identify the 'criminal' rather than the crime
 pheri samaajavigyaan dwaara aparaadh ho, chaahe koi bhi kare, kisi bhi paristhiti main kare, uskaa or koi kaaran nahin, keval yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vyaktigat swatantra ichha se kiya gaya he yaa prakritik yaa swaabhaavik kaarnon kaa parinnam he
 Garofalo considered crime a matter of psychology: according to him, there are four types of criminals - murderers, violent criminals, criminals against property, and criminals of lust
 garophalo ke mat se prandand, aajanm karagaar yaa deshnikala, ye hi teen sajaayen honi chahie
 Fon Haamel raised the discussion of criminal reform for the first time
 france ke pandit tarmde ne naitik jimmedaari, 'vyaktigat vishistataa' kii charchaa kii
 According to him, man is just a set of his consciousness and conscience
 uske kaaryon se jise dukh pahunche yani jiske prati aparaadh kiya jaay usko bhi samaan rup se saamaajik ekta ke prati sachet karnaa chahie
 France's state revolution declared 'human rights'
 apradhi bhi manushya hai
 He too has some natural rights
 isliye apradhi aparaadh kii vyakhya chaahate he
 The most obvious interpretation was given by the French Penal Code of 1934
 aparaadh vahi he jise kanuunan manaa kiya gaya ho
 The thing which is denied in the then environment is the crime
 kintu, kanuunan nazaij kaam karnaa hi aparaadh nahin rah gaya he
 The point which Dr
 Gutner had raised has become a great subject for every court today
 vahi aparaagh he
 If while flying a kite on the roof, a stone comes down on the road from a boy's foot and falls on the head of another person, then that boy is not guilty of murder
 atev mahatv kii vastu niyat he
 Real justice can only be done by mixing the crime and its intention to commit it
 kintu samajashaastra ke panditonke saamne yah samasya bhi thi or he ki samaaj kii haani karanevaal ke saath vyavhaar kaisaa ho
 Aflatoon was of the opinion that it is unfair to harm the harm
 prasiddh samaaj-shastri jivik ne spasht kaha tha ki nyaay kabhi nahin chahta ki bhul karanevaal yani aparaadh karanwane ko pidaa pahunchaai jaae
 Lord Haldane also advised not to consider crime, but to consider the criminal, his problems, his environment
 britain ke prasiddh raajnneetijna tathaa kai baar praghan mantri bananevaale winston churchill kaa kathan he ki aparaadh tathaa apradhi ke prati janata kii kisi bhaavana tathaa drushti he, usee se us desh kii sabhyataa kaa vaastavik anumaan lag saktaa he
 British law considers the same act to be a crime that is done ill-favorably, voluntarily, cunningly, done, allowed or allowed
 bahut se aparaadh aise hote hai jo aparaadh hone ke karan hi aparaadh nahin samajhe jate
 For example, gene type marriages are illegal in the UK, so even if married, it would not be considered a marriage, such as marrying a girl under 16, etc
 naveen audyogic sabhyataa main aparaadh kaa rup tathaa prakaar bhi badal gaya he
 New types of crimes have started happening which are difficult to imagine
 isliye aparaadh kii pahchaan ab is samay yahi he ki kanoon ne jis kaam ko manaa kiya he, vah aparaadh he
 The one who has done the forbidden work is the culprit
 kintu, apradhi paristhiti kaa das ho saktaa he, vivash ho saktaa he, isliye use pahchaanane kaa praytn karnaa hoga
 Today's criminology does not believe that someone has become a worshiper by learning from the stomach or someone is deliberately making it his 'life'
 har ek aparaadh kaa tathaa har ek apradhi kaa adhyayan hona chahie
 That is why every crime and every criminal has become the subject of personal study, personal diagnosis and personal medicine
 manovigyaan aparaadh ko manushya kii maansik ulajhanon kaa parinaam maanata he
 a person whose childhood does not pass in an atmosphere of love and encouragement, many types of mental glands of inferiority are formed in his mind
 in grathiyon main uski man main uski bahut si maansik shakti sanchit rahati he
 Dr
 Alfred Adler states that a person who has mental glands of inferiority in his mind inevitably commits many kinds of crimes
 yah aparaadh vah isliye karata he ki swayan ko vah duusare logon se adhik balavaan siddh kar sake
 The gland of inferiority remains in the mind in this person, he is always in a state of inner mental dissatisfaction
 vah sab samay aise kaamon main apane ko lagaae rahata he jisase sabhi log uski ore dekhen or uski prashansa kare
 The mental gland of inferiority puts man in such works, due to which the human being has to hear many kinds of condemnation
 es vyakti swayan ko sadaa charchaa kaa vishay banaae rakhana chahta he
 If it is not discussed for good works then it should be for bad works
 uski maansik granthi use shant man nahin rahane detii
 She always inspires him to do special work
 yadi aise vyakti ko dand kiya jaae to isse uskaa sudhaar nahin hota, apitu isse uski maansik granthi or bhi jatil ho jaati he
 The treatment of such a criminal requires a mental doctor
 aadhunik manovigyaan ne hamen bataaya he ki samaaj main aparaadh ko kam karne ke liye dandvidhaan ko kadaa karnaa paryaapt nahin he
 For this education is required in the society
 jab manushya kii koi pravriti bachapan se hi prabal ho jaati he to aage chalkaar vah vishesh prakaar ke kaaryo main prakashit hoti he
 These works are beneficial for the society or are anti-social
 samajavirohi kaary hi hamen vyakti ke prati uchit drushtikon rakhana hoga
 The child who is kept dearly and is allowed to do all kinds of things, does not have the ability to relinquish his happiness for the happiness of others
 es vyakti kii saamaajik bhavanaayen aviksit rah jaati he
 Life does not create goodness
 iske kaaran vah na to samaajik drushti se bhale bure kaa vichaar kar saktaa he ore na bure kaamon se swayan ko rokane kii kshamta praapt kar paata he
 The parents of the child and the surrounding air conditioners and schools work in it
 uchit shiksha kaa ek uddeshy yahi he ki balak apane upar sanyam kii kshamta aa jaae
 The higher the state of self-control, the less the crime
 samaaj main bahut se log apane vivek se pratikul aparaadh karte hai
 What is the reason for this? According to the discoveries of modern psychology, the childhood of such people would not have passed properly
 ye log buddhi main to janm se hi praveen the atev ye anek prakaar ke vichaaron ko jaan sake
 But they did not have such permanent feelings in their mind in their childhood so that they can stop themselves from doing inappropriate work
 ye sthaayee bhav jab tak manushya ke swabhaav ke ang nahin ban jate tab tak ve manushya ko duraachaar se rokane kii kshamta nahin dete
 Such scholars commit crimes and even curse themselves for them
 isse ve apni maansik ulajhanein badha lete hai
 Sometimes they use their scholarship to prove the morality of their unfair actions
 inkaa sudhaar saamaanya dandvidhaan se nahin ho paata
 They devise many ways to avoid them
 aise logon ko sudhaarney ke liye aavashyak he ki shiksha kaa dhyey aajeevika kamanaa athwa vyavahaarakushalata praapt kar lenaa na hokar maanav vyaktitv kaa sampurna vikaas arthath bauddhik or bhavatmak vikaas ho
 When a person starts to see his own interest in the interest of others and gets the ability to conduct according to this idea, then only he is a qualified citizen of the society
 aisa vyakti jab kuch karata he, vah samaaj ke hit ke liye hi hota he
 Crime is a type of social asymmetry
 yah vyaktigat maansik vishmata kaa parinaam he
 This type of asymmetry starts in childhood
 iske sudhaar ke liye prarambh main aadat daalani padati he ki vah dusron ke sukh main nij sukh kaa anubhav kare
 He should do such things which will benefit everyone and praise him
 hindu dharamshastron ke anusaar saamanyatya chalit dharamshastra ke niyam, saamaajik niyam or rajanium ke viruddh aacharan karnaa hi aparaadh hai
 The field of Hindu theology is very broad, under which the idea of violation of all kinds of rules, economic, political, social etc
 is available
 isi ke anusaar hindu dharamshastron main saamaanya rup se 32 prakaar ke aparaadh bataae gaye hai
 The number of them can also be more because the nature of these crimes also varies according to the variation of country, time and society
 isliye bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke vichaar vyakt karte dikhaai padate hai
 Hindu theology or memoir appears to express different views regarding crimes and their punishments
 hindu dharamshastra ke antargat aparaadh ke swaroop par vichaar karne ke liye manu, yajyavlky, parashar, naarad, brihaspati, katyayan aadi ko pramaan mana jaataa hai
 In considering the crime from a mental point of view, Lambrozo had said long ago that the body of a criminal has a special shape
 parantu us samay unke mat ko manyata nahin mili
 Recently some experiments were conducted on criminals which concluded that 60 percent of the criminals have abnormal body designs
 raktakoshika main rahanevaale 23 gunasutra yugmon main se aparaadhiyon kaa 21vaan gunasutra yugma asaamaanya paaya gaya
 In 1968, an argument was made in a court of Celadan against a man, the murderer of his four children, that my chromosome is super-primitive, that is, the sequence of chromosomes in my blood cells is 'XY', which caused my crime psychosis
 It is natural and i have murdered my children to abdicate responsibility in an abnormal mental state
 nyaayalay ne faisle main yadhyapi uski asaamaanya maansik shaareerik banaavat kaa ullekh nahin kiya gaya to bhi asaamaanya dasha ke aadhaar par apradhi ko chhod diya gaya
 In 1969, Dr
 Hargovind Khurana received the Nobel Prize by rendering the genetic signal theory according to which the behavior of a person depends on the structure of his gene group and the structure of the gene group is based on heredity
