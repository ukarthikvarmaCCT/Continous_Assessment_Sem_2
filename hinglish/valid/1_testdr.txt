 Along with the message received from the circadian clock, it tells the body that it needs sleep
 sirkadian aavartan se neend se jagane kaa mukhya rup se nirdhaaran hota he
 a person who regularly wakes up early, usually cannot sleep longer than his normal time, even if he has slept less
 neend kii avadhi DEC2 jin dwaara prabhavit he
 Some people have mutations of this gene; They sleep two hours less than normal

 The optimal amount of sleep cannot be a meaningful concept unless sleep or timing are seen in association with a person's circadian rotation
 a person's major sleep episode can be relatively fruitless and insufficient if it occurs at the "wrong" time of day; One should sleep for at least six hours before the body temperature is low
 sahi timming wo he jab neend ke madhya prakaran ke baad or jagane se pehle nimnlikhit do chihnak yaa marker prakat ho jaaen: Human sleep can vary by age and between individuals, and sleep is considered adequate if there is no drowsiness or dysfunction during the day
 vishvavidhyalay california, saan diego ke das lakh vayaskon ke ek manacchikitsa adhyayan main paaya gaya ki jo log sabase adhik samay tak jivit hai ve raat main chah se saat ghante roj swayan prerit hokar soya karte hai
 Another study on the risk of sleep duration and mortality in women found a similar result
 anya adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki "pratidin 7 se 8 ghante se adhik neend lene waalon main badhi hui mrityu dar lagaataar judy hui he", haalanki is adhyayan kaa yah bhi kahana he ki iskaa kaaran avsaad or samajok-aarthik sthiti ho sakati he, jo aankadon kii drushti se sah-sambandhit ho jate hai
 It has also been said that compared to those who wake up on an alarm, those who naturally wake up after less sleep only show a correlation between fewer sleep hours and less morbidity
 varavik vishvavidhyalay or vishvavidhyalay college landan ke shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki neend kii kami hryday rog se mrityu ke khatre ko dugune se adhik badha detii he, lekin bahut adhik neend bhi mrityu ke khatre ko duguna karne ke saath judi ho sakati he, haalanki mukhya rup se hryday rog se nahin
 Professor Francisco Capuccio stated, "short sleep has been seen to be a risk factor for weight gain, hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and sometimes death; but long sleep leads to increased death as opposed to short sleep-mortality
 There is no possible mechanism to link the rate, it is yet to be investigated

 Sleep debt results in loss of ability to perform high level cognitive functions
 neurophysiological or kaaryaatmak imaging adhyayanon ne dikhaaya he ki mastishk ke saamne ke kshetra vishesh rup se homeostatic neend dabaav ke liye pratikriyasheel hai
 Scientists do not agree on how much sleep debt is possible; Does it accumulate according to a person's average sleep or is there some other criterion; Nor has there been any significant change in the prevalence of sleep debt among adults in the industrialized world in recent decades
 yah zarur hua he ki pehle kii tulana main pashchimi samaajon ke bachche kam so rahe hai
 It is suspected that when and for how long a person needs sleep, such as a greater magnitude of sleep-related behavior, is regulated by our genetics
 shodhakartaaon ne kuch saboot kii khoj kii he jisase is dharna ko samarthan miltaa hua lagata he
 Many theories about the function of sleep have proposed their own explanations, but it appears that understanding about the subject is currently incomplete
 aisa sambhav he ki kuch moulik kaary ko puraa karne ke liye neend kaa vikaas hua or samay ke saath isane kai kaam apana liya
 The issue was raised that if sleep was not necessary, one would be expected to know: aaj tak koi bhi pashu aisa nahin mila he jo in mandandon ko puraa kar sake
 Among the many proposed functions of sleep are the following
 neend dwaara ghaav bharne main sahaayta milte dekha gaya he
 In 2004 Gumustekin et al
 a study conducted by the study showed that lack of sleep hindered the healing of mice's burns
 yah paaya gaya he ki neend kii kshati rogksham pranali ko prabhavit karti he
 In 2007, JÃ¤ger et al
 In a study conducted by, mice were deprived of sleep for 24 hours

 It is now possible to be said that "sleep damage attenuates immune function and presents a challenge to immunological sleep manipulation," and it has been reported that mammalian animals that spend their long sleeps in the immune system Invest, because species that have long sleeps have more white blood cells
 yah pramanit hona abhi baaki he ki neend kii avadhi daihik vikaas ko prabhavit karti he
 In 2007 Jenny et al
 In a study by 305 children growth, height and weight were recorded, this was done in correlation with their parents, parents were informed of the bedtime of the children and the study lasted for nine years
 
 It was found that "changes in sleep duration in children do not seem to have an effect on their development
" " yah dekha gaya ki neend-or adhik vishesh rup se dhimi gati kii neend - vayask purushon ke hormone staron kii vruddhi ko prabhavit karti he
 During an eight-hour sleep, Van Couture, Leproult, and Platt found that those with a higher percentage of SWS also had a higher growth of hormone secretion, while those with a lower percentage of SWS had a lower growth of hormones
 neend ke swasthyakaari kaary ke paksh main anek tark he
 The metabolic phase during sleep is surgeon action; Surgeons such as growth hormones are secreted preferentially such as action hormones during sleep
 saamanytah, prajatiyon main neend kii avadhi, jaanavar ke aakaar se vipareet dhang se sambandhit he or sidhe-sidhe aadhariya chayapachay dar se judi hui he
 Rats with a very high basal metabolic rate sleep up to 14 hours daily, while elephants and giraffes sleep only 3-4 hours with low basal metabolic rates
 vaataavaran se andrik rachana ko band kiye bina shanti se aaraam karne ke jariye urja sangrakshan sampann kiya ja saktaa he, jo sambhawatah ek khatarnaak sthiti he
 a dull-sleeping animal is more likely to survive predators, while still conserving energy

 According to the ontogenetic hypothesis of REM sleep, newborn-related activity during REM sleep is particularly important for body development
 sakriy neend ke abhaav ke prabhaavon par kiye gayi adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki jivan ke armbh main is abhaav se vyavhaar kii samasyaayein, sthaayee neend vighn, mastishk pind main kami or ek asaamaanya pariman main neuron koshikaon kii mrityu kii samasyaayein paidaa hoti hai
 REM sleep appears to be important for brain development
 shishuon kii neend ke adhikansh bhaag par REM neend kaa hi kabja hota he, shishu apana adhik samay neend main hi guzaara karte hai
 In various species, the more immature the baby is born, the more time it spends in REM sleep

 Additionally, REM sleep deprivation leads to developmental abnormalities later in life
 baharhaal, isaki vyakhya nahin kii gayi he ki praudh vayaskon ko tab bhi kyon REM neend kii jarurat padati he
 Aquatic mammal infants do not sleep REM in infancy; REM sleep in such animals increases with aging
 vaigyanikon ne aise anek tareeke bataaye hai jinamein neend ko smriti se sambandhit dikhaaya gaya he
 a study by Turner, Drummond, Salamat, and Brown showed that sleep deprivation affected working memory
 karyrat smriti mahatvapurn he kyonki yah nirnay lene, tark-vitark karne or praasangik smriti jaise ucch stareey sangyanatmak kaaryon ke adhik prakraman or madad ke liye soochnaaon ko sakriy rakhata he
 The study allowed 18 women and 22 men to sleep only 26 minutes per night over a period of four days
 in vyaktiyon ne puure aaraam ke baad shuruyaat main sangyanatmak pareekshan die or phir chaar dinon main neend ke abhaav ke dauraan din main do baar pareekshan kiye gayi
 In the final test, the average working memory expansion of this sleep-deprived group was found to be 38% lower than the controlled group
 REM or dhimi gati kii neend jaise neend ke kuch charnon dwaara smriti alag tarah se prabhavit hoti jaan padati he
 In a study cited in Born, Rasch and Gess, several human subjects were used: awakening controlled groups and sleep testing groups
 The sleep and wake groups were taught a task and then tested in both the nighttime and late night time, in order to balance the order in all participants
 jab neend ke dauraan un pratibhaagiyon ke mastishk ko scan kiya gaya to hypnogram ne paaya ki raat ke aarambh main neend kaa charan SWS haaavee rahata he, jo neend charan gatividhi kaa ausatan 23% ke aasapaas kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Compared to the controlled group, the early-night test group performed 16% better on the declarative memory test
 der-raatri neend ke dauraan, lagbhag 24% ke saath REM sabase sakriy neend kaa charan ban gaya or niyantrit samooh kii tulana main prakriyaatmak smriti pareekshan main der-raatri pareekshan samooh ne 25% behatar pradarshan kiya
 This suggests that late-night rem-rich sleep benefits procedural memory, while early-night sws-rich sleep benefits declarative memory
 datta dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan main in parinaamon kaa paroksh rup se samarthan kiya gaya he
 22 male mice were made eligible for the study
 ek aise dibbe kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha jisamen ek chuha maje se ek chor se duusare chor tak aa-ja sake
 The bottom of the box was made of steel mesh
 ek dhwani ke saath dibbe main ek roshni chamakati

 The other half, the control group, were placed on the same trial, but the mice were jerked regardless of their response
 prayek prashikshan satr ke baad, chuuhe ko poligraphic recording ke liye chah ghante tak ek recording pinjre main rakhaa jaataa
 yah prakriya lagaataar teen dinon tak duhraayi gayi
 This study found that during post-sleep recording sessions of sleep testing, mice spent 25
47% more time in REM sleep after exercise trials, compared to after control trials
 These tests were conducted by Born et al
 The study results support a clear indication of the correlation between REM sleep and procedural knowledge
 datta adhyayan kaa ek avlokan yah he ki pareekshan ke baad recording satr ke dauraan niyantran samooh kii tulana main neend abhyaas samooh ne SWS main 180% adhik samay bitaayaa
 is tathy ko kudrimoti, burns or mecnuton dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan se samarthan mila
 This study suggests that after spatial search activity, the pattern of hippocampal cells in the experiment is reactivated during SWS
 kudrimoti at al
 ke ek adhyayan main, kisi chor main inaam kaa upyog karke saat chuhon ko ek rekhiy trek main daudaya gaya
 Rats were allowed 30 minutes to adapt to the track, then ran for 30 minutes in the track for reward-based training, and then allowed to rest for 30 minutes
 in teen prayek avadhiyon ke dauraan, chuhon kii neend ke charnon kii soochna ke lieiji data ekatra kiye gayi
 Kudrimoti et al
 Calculated the mean firing rates of the cells of the hippocampal during the pre-behavior of the SWS and the average of 22 track-times of seven mice, with a ten-minute break placed three times in response to the SWS
 nattejey bataate hai ki pareekshan daud satr ke baad ke das minute main purv str kii tulana main hippocample kii koshikaon kii min firing rate main 12% kii vruddhi dekhi gayi; haalanki 20 minute ke baad, min firing rate teji se purv str par waapas laut gayi
 The increase in firing of hippocampal cells during SWS after spatial exploration may explain why SWS sleep levels were increased in Datta's study, as it was also associated with a form of spatial exploration
 SWS ke dauraan dhime dolan ke pariman ko badhaane ke liye puromukhy valkal main ekadish dhara uttejan ko shaamil karte hue ek adhyayan hua 
 Directional current stimulation greatly increased word-pair recall the next day, providing evidence that SWS plays a large role in the consolidation of relevant memories
 vibhinn adhyayanon kaa yah kahana hai ki neend or smriti ke jatil kaaryon ke bich ek sah-sambandh he
 Harvard sleep researchers Saper and Stickgold state that an essential part of memory and practice consists of nerve cell pulmonary, which sends information to the cell body to be organized into new neuronal connections
 is prakriya kii maang he ki koi bahari jaankaree in drumashmon ko prastut nahin kii jaay or yah bhi kaha gaya ki sambhawatah isiilie neend ke samay smritiyaan or gyaan thos or vyavasthit hoti hai
 The principle of "preservation and preservation" holds that sleep functions adaptively
 din ke 24 ghanton ke un bhaagon main jab praani kii raksha karata he, jab vah jagaa hota he or isiilie aasapaas ghumta rahata he or jab vyakti bade jokhim main hota he
 The organism does not need 24 hours to feed and it meets other needs
 anukulan ke is drushtikon se, jeev nuksaan ke raste se dur rahete hai, jahaan ve anya sambhavit majboot jeevon kaa shikaar ban sakate hai
 They sleep at the same time which maximizes their safety, providing them physical ability and their accommodation
 
 However, this theory fails to explain why the brain breaks down with the external environment during normal sleep
 is siddhant ke khilaaf ek or tark he ki neend mahaj vaataavaran se pashuon ko alag karne kaa ek niskriy parinaam nahin he, balki ek "drive" he;neend lene ke kram main pashu apane vyavhaar main tabdili let he
 Therefore, circadian regulation is more than sufficient to explain the duration of activity and inactivity, which is adaptable to the organism, but even more peculiar peculiarities of sleep possibly serve other and unknown functions
 iske alaava, parirakshan siddhant ko yah vyakhya karne kii jarurat he ki singh jaise maansaahaari, jo khaadya shrinkhalaa main sabase upar hai or jinhen adhik bhay bhi nahin he, kyon bahut adhik soya karte hai
 It has been said that they need to reduce energy degradation when they are not on the hunt
 parirakshan siddhant isaki bhi vyakhya nahin karata he ki jaleey stanpayi chalate hue kyon soya karte hai
 Inactivity during these sensitive hours does the same and becomes more beneficial, as the creature is still able to meet environmental challenges like predators etc
 nidrahin raat ke doshapurn anukulan ke baad neend phir se palat kar aati he, lekin spasht rup se kisi kaaran se hi aati he
 At the time of his sleep, a zebra, which is trying to save its life from a lion, falls asleep during the day, which is no more vulnerable than being a victim

 Dreaming is stimulated by pons and dreams occur mostly during the REM phase of sleep
 sapane ke kaary ke bare main logon ne anek avadharanaen pesh kii hai
 Sigmund Freud unquestionably believed that dreams are the expression of imperfect desires that are put or thrown into the unconscious mind and he used dream interpretation as psychoanalysis to discover these desires
 dekhen frid: da interpritesan of drims Freud's work deals with the psychological role of dreams, which clearly does not exclude any physical role that may be possible
 It is therefore not ruled out by the increasing modern interest in the organization and consolidation of recent memory and experience
 haal ke shodh kaa daawa he ki abhyaas or anubhav ke dauraan chetopagam samparkon ke samekan or vyavasthaapan kii samgr bhoomika neend kii he
 The activation synthesis theory of John Allen Hobson and Robert mccarley states that dreams are caused by the indiscriminate firing of neurons in the brain vulva during the REM period

 Research suggests that sleep patterns vary in different cultures
 samaajon main sabase bada antar yah he ki kahin bade paimaane par kritrim roshni ke strot hai or kahin nahin hai
 The primary difference is that the pattern of sleep has been much brittle in older cultures

 In some societies the pattern of sleep is broken, in which people sleep throughout the day and for brief periods at night
 bahut saare khanaabadosh yaa shikari-faramar samaajon main log puure din yaa raat bhar sote-jagate rahete hai, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki kab kya kuch ho rahaa he
 Artificial illumination began to be available on a large scale in industrialized Western countries since at least the mid-19th century and the introduction of lighting led to a significant change in sleep patterns everywhere
 saamaanya taur par, log raat ke samay sone jane ke bahut baad atyant gahari neend main hote hai, haalanki hameshaa aisa sach nahin hota he
 In some societies, people usually sleep with at least one other person or with animals
 kuch anya samskritiyon main, log sabase antarang parijan jaise ki pati-patni ko chhodkar virale hi kisi ke saath sote hai
 In almost all societies, the sleeping partner is controlled by social rules

 Some sleep directly on the ground, others sleep on a sheet or blanket, and some sleep on a plank or bed
 kuch kambal par, kuch takiyon ke saath, kuch saadhaaran sirahaane ke saath or kuch sir ko bagaiyr koi sahaara die sote hai
 These options, through a variety of factors; Weeds are fixed to protect from attackers, depending on the variety of house, technique and insect-feeding

 Many mammals sleep for a long time-to-long ratio every 24 hours
 haalanki, kiler whale kuch dolphin apane jivan ke pehle maheene ke dauraan nahin soti hai
 These differences can be interpreted in such a way that newborn mammals are protected by their parents when they sleep, whereas marine organisms need to be constantly alert to their predators, even at the young age

21 aadhuniktam prachlit pravritiyaan granthalay vargeekaran kaa itihaas pradarshit karata he ki vargeekaran kii yojanaon kaa vikaas purna aankik, jaise--librari of congress or ryder international vargeekaran, se swatantra mukh, vishleshnatmak-sanshleshneey, jaise--dvibindu vargeekaran kaa teesraa roopaantar tak tak hua
 The most popular trends in classification are: standardization, guest planning and computerization based on principles
 pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan vargeekaran kii ekarupata arthath `anterrashtriya vargeekaran yojana' kii taraf praytn kiye ja rahe hai
 This will provide the necessary savings of the inner power of intellectual readers, especially scholars
 yah anubhav kiya gaya he ki aisi vidhi kaa vikaas kiya jaay jo siddhanton par aadhaarit ho
 The expansion of knowledge is happening very rapidly
 naye-naye antar sanyam tathaa bahra sayanm vishay utpann ho rahe hai
 To deal effectively and productively with this expansion, a classification scheme should be in place that can accommodate new ideas to a commendable level, without changing its basic structure
 vargeekaran yojana ke vikaas, uskaa dhaanchaa taiyaar karne ke liye vidhi-tantra or pralekhnon ke vargeekaran, ke maarg-darshan hetu vargeekaran ke pragatisheel siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav kiya jaataa rahaa he
 This work was made possible by hospitality based on the principles of classification provided by Ranganathan and proved to be helpful in modernizing the classification scheme
 aaj ke yug main soochna ke rakh-rakhaav va usko pun: prapti ke liye sanganakeekaran kaa prachlan he
 We need powerful techniques and tools for information retrieval and its organization
 soochna-tantron ke sanganakikrut soochna pun: prapan main vargeekaran kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav kiya ja chukaa he, iske vargeekaran kaa mahatva or bad jaataa he
 a second trend is that of general versus special classification
 kyonki sab prakaar ke granthalayon, soochna-kendron, pralekhan kendron se yah apeksha kii jaati he ki uske paas sabhi prakaar ke pralekhon, kaa sangrah hoga, parantu vishesh mahatv ne un pralekhon, jinase ki ve sambandhit hai, unka ati sookshm-str par vargeekaran aavashyak hota he
 Thus, for classification of all types of documents, it is absolutely necessary to have a general classification
 yah dow ranganath the jinhone vargeekaran kii ek naveen kism--`swatantranmukh, vishleshnatmak-sanshleshneey vargeekaran' kaa nirmaan kiya, jo na keval falak vyavasthaapan ke liye hi apitu anukramanika taiyaar karne, aadi ke liye bhi mukt-kanth rup se sweekaar kii gayi
 For classification, 'free-face, analytic, syntactic scheme' are other schemes such as - often calculative examples such as Dewy Decimal Classification, often pane eg, ubiquitous decimal classification and hard pane
 udhaahrant: dvibindu-vargeekaran kaa pratham va dwitiya roopaantar, kii tulana main atyadhik aadhuniktaa pradaan karti he
 Which is the only solution to solve the latest trends and problems of classification
 vargeekaran ke kshetra main dow ranganathan kaa sarvaadhik anshdaan dvibindu vargeekaran he, jo sarv-pratham san 1933 main prakashit hua
 The second edition was published in 1939, the third in 1950, the fourth 1952 and the fifth 1957 and the sixth 1960 and the seventh edition is still at the juncture of uncertainty
 dow ranganathan keval vargeekarnacharya ke rup main hi nahin, apitu ek vargkaar ke rup main bhi jane jate hai
 During 1946-47, when he was Professor and Librarian of Library Science of Kashi Hindu University, according to his classification scheme, he re-classified about one lakh texts of University Library in a short span of about 18 months
 is kaary ke liye unhone apane hi diye gayi niyam paraasaran kaa niyam kii sahaayta lee
 The important thing is that he did all this in his 56 years of age by following his responsible works like reading work, administrative work etc
 dow ranganathan ne sarv-pratham `vargeekaran siddhanth' kaa sutarapaat kiya
 These principles provide consistency, uniformity and solidity to the structure of classification systems and other word-store control measures
 aadhuniktam pravritiyon main isaki upyogit nimnaankit hai: 'classification work should be divided into three faces', it has been felt
 yah vichaar sarv-pratham dow ranganathan ne 1944 main sweekaar kiya
 By 1952, he was able to understand this goal well and divided the classification work into three faces namely Kalpana pane, Verbal pane and An kan pane
 unhone paaya ki `vichaar falak' sanyukt evam mishrit vishyon ko unke mukhon, upmukhon, tathaa ashleshon main vishleshit tathaa sanshleshit karne tathaa sahaayak anukram pradaan karne se sambhavat: sambandhit he
 The function in the 'speech pane' is centered on the sub-terms for the defined vocabulary and expresses the latest prevalent form of the words from the standard terminology
 agar anterrashtriya paribhaashik-shabdaawalee kaa sthapana ho jaay or prayog hetu apanaaya jaay to yah bahut hi sahaayak siddh hogi
 General ideas are presented by Adco in 'A Nanna Plaque'
 dow ranganathan ne mishrit a nan tantra kiruparekha atyaadhik aatithy pradaa na karne hetu prayukt kii
 He included many tips to provide utmost hospitality to new ideas and to break the persistence of non-violence
 ye `khand yukti',` rikti yukti', `rikt an k', `shoonyakaaran-a k ', tathaa `shunya-shunya kaarak a k', naye-naye vichaaron kaa bahirveshit tathaa antarveshit karne ke liye prayukt kiya
 In spite of all this, he gave more tips to get a lot of hospitality, they are: mass device, alphabetical device, chronological device, common device, common aspect device, decimal fraction device, calculative device, environment device, key device, geographical device Devices, group unclass devices, mixed base devices, numerical devices, observational devices, memory-assisted table containing devices, etc
 
 unhone a nan ke liye parivartansheel shakti pradutt sanyojak chinhon kaa prayog kiya, jo baad main sanketak ank ke naam se jane gayi
 They also make it easy to use computers
 sanketak ank, vibhinn talikaon se liye gayi upmukhon, ko jodakar anek prakaar ke sanyukt evam mishrit vishyon kaa nirmaan karne main bolt va nat kii tarah kaary karte hai
 Dr
 Ranganathan incorporated an organized set of notations, sub-letters and principles to give a direction to the classification masters and classifiers
 ye siddhanth, abhidharana va upasutra, pralekhan shodh evam prashikshan kendron bharat ke vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon ke granthalayon evam granthalay vigyaan ke vibhaagon main pathan pathan vaastavik granthalay vargeekaran ke dauraan parakhe ja chuke hai
 In the third edition of Dr
 Ranganathan's 'prolegomena to Library Classification', 11 normative principles, 40 sub-letters, 13 postulates, 4 principles are given for the mouth sequence and 18 principles for the auxiliary sequence
 unhone mulmukh, upmukh, tathaa spacintres, kaa vichaar diya
 These sub-faces are divided into five fundamental categories: personality, element, energy, place, and time

 Dr
 Ranganathan had designed the classification system for many subjects, based on theoretical development
 lagbhag 150 aise vishay hai, jinkeliye dvibindu vargeekaran ke aadhaar par gahan talikaay taiyaar kiye ja chuke hai
 His article on taxonomy in 'annals for Library Signs and Documentation and Library Signs' is sufficiently helpful in solving difficult problems related to deep classification
 hamaare vichaar se dow ranganathan ko bhavishya main dwi-bindu vargeekaran ke liye nahin, apitu iske aadharbhoot siddhanton ke liye yaad kiya jaavega

 The dog itself was hybridized with Flora and one of its offspring was a bitch named Sheiken of Alt
 George Alt hybridized Shaken with a bulldog named Tom of Doctor Tonysen, which led to the historically important dog Mohlber's Floki
 Floki was the first boxer to enter the German stud book after winning the show above for St Bernard in Munich in 1895, which was the first event for Boxers to become class specific
 floki kii bahan, sietch

 John Wegner stated the following facts about this bitch in The Boxer: yah naam "boxr" is nasl kii pravritiyon se hi vyutpann hua he, kyonki ye kute apni pichley taangon par khadey ho pate hai or apane saamne vaale panjon se "boxing" kar sakate hai
 According to Andrew H
 Brace's Pet Owners Guide to the Boxer, the theory is a far less plausible explanation
 unhone daawa kiya ki "is baat kii sambhaavna nahin he ki ek rashtrawaad vaala raashtra apni sabase prasidd naslon main se ek ko itnaa spasht naam de
" German linguistic and historical evidence The earliest written evidence of the word boxer is found in the 18th century, where it is in a text in Deutsches FremdwÃ¶rterbuch, whose author's name is Musas, and the article is written in 1782 "daÃ er aus Furcht vor dem groÃen Baxer Salmonet 


 sich auf einige Tage in ein gerÃ¤umiges PackfaÃ

 At that time the equivalent of" boxer "was spelled" baxer "

 In the same line with more historical facts, Brace states that there are several other theories about the etymology of the breed's name, favoring the claim that the younger Bullenbeisser was known as "boxl" and the boxer This is a distorted form of the word
 isi dhara main ek or siddhant he jo is tathy par aadhaarit he ki nasl ke us samay tak vikaas tak kutton kaa ek samooh munich main Bierboxer ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 These dogs were a mixture of Bullenbeisser and other similar species

 The British army could not follow him in any way
 ant main mir kasim kii sena ke ek angrej sainik ne vishwasghaat kiya
 He saw the secret passage of Najaf Khan very well
 4 sitambar 1763 i
 kii raat main vah angreji sena ko usee maarg se liva laayaa or mir kasim ke pandrah hajaar sainik kaam aae
 Now Mir Qasim thought of seeking help from Nawab shuja-ud-daula of Awadh, but Najaf refused him and drew his attention to the horrific consequences
 kintu mir kasim na mana or najaf use chhodkar bundelkhand ke sardaar hindoopati kii seva main chalaa gaya
 Shuja's eyes were on Bundelkhand and hence he pledged to help Mir Qasim after defeating Hindupati
 is par mir kasim ne kaary sheeghra samaapt karne ke liye swayan hindoopati par chadhaai kar di
 Najaf compromised diplomacy by intimidating Hindupati
 mir kasim vijayi hokar shuja ke paas elahabaad laut aayaa
 Seeing Najaf's successful diplomacy and military aptitude, the British called him from Bundelkhand and joined him before fighting Shuja
 najaf ko shuja se purana bair tha is kaaran usne angrejon ko sahaayta dena saharsha sweekaar kar liya
 From 1764 AD, he became a great assistant to the British

 He drove the Jats out of Mathura
 11 disambar 1773 i
 ko usne agra nagar par or 18 farvari 1774 i
 ko agra ke kile par jaaton ko bhagaakar adhikaar kar liya
 Seeing his influence and military talent in Delhi, Nawab Wazir Shuja-ud-daulah considered forgetting the enmity and befriending him
 usne najaf ko bhent ke liye aamantrit kiya or use naayab vazeer manonith kiya
 Shuja also prepared him to assist against the Ruhels and by this he persuaded Shah Alam to lead the army
 ruhela yuddh ke pashchaat bulandshahr, mujffar nagar, meerut, agra, panipat, sonpat, haansi tathaa hisar main nazaf khan kaa prabhaav kshetra sweekaar kiya gaya jisase shuja kaa koi sambandh nahin tha
 Setting this limit, Shuja limited Najaf's ambition
 shuja ne use uttari bharat kaa atyant mahatvapurn vyakti sweekaar kiya or apni kanya kaa sambandh uske saath sthapit kar use apana damaad bhi bana liya
 He died in 1782 AD

 The most notable feature of the lake is its pink color

 The pink color in a container is believed to be due to the presence Dunaliella salina

 lev trotsaki rus ke marxvaadi krantikari tathaa siddhantkaar, soviet rajaneta tathaa laal sena ke sansthaapak va pratham netaa the
 Trotsky commanded the Red Army, which was victorious in the fierce civil war that followed the Russian Revolution
 ek siddhantkaar ke rup main sthaayee kranti ke siddhanth ke jariye unhone marxvaadi vimarsh main yogadan kiya
 At the same time Trotsky also proposed a rule that the level of development of capitalism is not the same everywhere, which results in the simultaneous occurrence of two phases of social and historical development in backward countries
 beesvin sadi ke pehle dashak main marxvaadiyon ke bich chal rahe bahes-mubahise ke bich trotski kii is saidhantik uplabdhi ne rus jaise audyogic rup se pichde desh main kranti karne ke tark ko majbootee pradaan kii
 After Lenin's death, Trotsky opposed the principle of establishing socialism in a country promoted by Stalin, but he continued to fall alone in the struggle within the party
 pehle unhen party se nikaala gaya, or phir soviet rajya ke viruddh shadyantra karne ke aarope main desh-nikaala de diya gaya
 During the expulsion, Trotsky strongly criticized the Soviet Union being formed under Stalin, calling it a bureaucrat, autocratic and state capitalist state
 soviet sikret police se bachane ke liye sari duniya main bhatakate hue trotski ne 'permanent revolution', 'revolution bitrede' or teen khandon main 'da history of russian revolution' jaise clasik granth kii rachana kii
 In order to bring his dream of world revolution on earth, he also founded the Fourth Communist International, which did not get any special success

 Trotsky's followers have formed small communist parties in many countries of the world
 soviet style ke communism ke vikalp ke rup main unke vichaaron ko trotscvaad kii sangya mil chuki he
 Trotsky's real name was Lev Davidovich Bronstein
 bahut kam umr main hi ve marxvad ke prati aakarshith hue or bhumigat raajnneeti karte hue 'trotski' kaa gupt naam apana liya
 His life can be divided into three parts
 pehla hissaa vah he jab roosi marxvad ke ek swatantra hastakshar kii tarah ve krantikari andolan main bhaag lete hue pehle lenin ke najadik aaye or phir unka saath dene se inkaar kar diya
 The second part began from 1917 until 1923 when he pioneered the Soviet Revolution by joining shoulder to shoulder with Lenin
 iske baad unke jivan kaa teesraa daur shuru hua jab unhone kranti ke laabhon kii raksha karne ke liye stalinavaad ke kilaaf abhiyaan chhedaa
 Among Bolshevik leaders, Trotsky was the only one who was not seen as his follower despite being Lenin's main partner
 1903 main roosi saamaajik janavaadee majdoor party jab bolshevikon or menshavikon main vibhajit hui, to trotski ne lenin kaa saath nahin diya
 In the beginning, he condemned Bolshevism by saying that it was not a proletariat but a formula of dictatorship over the proletariat
 us samay unhen shaq tha ki lenin robsprre jaise shadyantrkaari netaa hai jinke kaaran rus kaa samaajawaadee andolan pathbhrasht ho jayega
 At the time Trotsky was of the view that the goal of socialism cannot be achieved by commanding revolution in the hands of a disciplined party of professional revolutionaries doing secret political work
 ve ek adhik loktantric or khule charitra kii party banane ke paksh main the
 In 1905 he emerged as the Soviet leader of St
 Petersburg
 rus kii is pehali soviet ne 1905 kii kranti main pramukh bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya tha, or trotski ise pramanik loktantr kaa namoona maanate the
 After the revolution failed, the Tsarshi arrested him and sent him to Siberia
 trotski vahaan se bhaag nikle or aglaa dashak unhone europe main bitaayaa
 During this period he remained with the Mensheviks organizationally
 1917 main ve rus laute tab farvari kranti ke kaaran zaarshahi kaa patan ho chukaa tha
 Now he joined the Bolsheviks because he felt that there was a lot of similarity between his and Lenin's ideas
 swayan lenin trotski kii raajnneetik or saidhantik kshamtaaon ke prashansak the
 Trotsky grew in stature in the Bolshevik party
 unhone videshi maamalon ke kamisar ke taur par germanon ke saath shanti- vaarta main bhaag liya
 Trotsky, as a military commissar, played a major role in the formation of the Red Army and led him brilliantly in the Civil War
 in safaltaaon ke kaaran trotski ko lenin ke sambhavit uttaradhikariyon main ek ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Like Lenin, Trotsky had deep faith in the creative abilities of the Russian proletariat
 is vishwaas ke aadhaar main vishwa-poonjeewaad ke adhyayan se nikali unki ek vishesh tarah kii saidhantik samaj thi
 Trotsky was of the view that in order to get rid of its backwardness, no country needs to go through the steps that developed countries have gone through
 in deshon main pichhadepan ke saath-saath agadepan ke lakshan bhi ubharate hai
 Analyzing on the basis of this theory, Trotsky showed that much of Russia is backward and underdeveloped, but it has also been infiltrated by Western influences
 kai jagahon par aarthik utpaadan or sambandhon ke viksit taur-tareeke apanaae jane lage hai
 These moments of industrial development have created a considerable proletariat and a westernized intellectual elite in urban centers
 parinamswaroop raajnneetik pratirodh or sakriyata ke radical rup prachlit ho gayi hai
 Since industrialization is imposed from above, the local capitalist class is weak, but the proletariat is strong
 poonjeewaadi varg loktantric kranti karne se darataa he or apni aakshamata ke kaaran apana aitihaasik daayitv nahin nibhaa paa rahaa he, isliye yah jimmedaari sarvhaara varg ke kandhon par aa gayi he
 Taking the peasants under his leadership, the working class will have to move towards socialism by eradicating feudalism and all its remnants
 trotski ne apane siddhant ko sthaayee kranti qaraar diya
 In 1850, Marx used this position while addressing the General Council of the Communist League
 trotski ke mutabik praaq-poonjeewaadi maansikta vaale kisaan is krantikari prakriya main mazdooron kaa saath bahut dur tak nahin de paayenge
 Their interest will remain till they get the ownership of the land
 kisaanon ke saath banaaya gaya jo morcha kranti ke liye rasta saaf karata he, vahi samaajwaad kii rachana main baadhak sabit hoga
 Therefore, in one country, especially in Russia, the construction of socialism cannot be successful until the revolution takes place in other countries as well
 isliye rus kii kranti ko vishwa-kranti, khaas kar viksit deshon main kranti ke shuruaati charan ke taur par hi dekha janaa chahie
 Interestingly, there seems to be a lot of similarity between these things of Trotsky and many theories propounded by Lenin after World War I
 kuch trotskivaadiyon ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya he ki 1917 kii kranti main lenin dwaara trotski ke hi siddhanton kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 It is another matter that Trotsky himself never said this after accepting Lenin's leadership in 1917
 lenin kii mrityu ke baad stallin ne ek desh main samaajwaad ke nirmaan kii shodhpatr taiyaar kii
 Theorists like Bukharin were also with Stalin in this matter
 par trotski ne chetavanee di ki is siddhanth par amal karne ke nattejey rus ke liye vinaashkari niklenge
 He said that the time has not come for the collectivization of farming
 trotski lenin dwaara sthapit komintern ko soviet videsh niti ke aujaar main simit kar dene ke bhi viruddh the
 He argued that the Soviet Union must follow the path of industrialization and modernization, but these achievements cannot be considered synonymous with socialism
 samaajwaad kaa matlab he, shram kii unchi utpaadakta, uske parinamswaroop behatar jivan-str or apane poonjeewaad ke sarvaadhik viksit roopon jaisaa samaaj
 This can only happen when the proletariat has the reins of the world economy
 trotski kaa kahana tha ki stallin ke tahat jo soviet vyavastha he, use keval sankramanakalin samajha janaa chahie
 At present, it cannot be guaranteed that it will develop into socialism or it will degenerate into some version of capitalism
 trotski maanate the ki rus kii naukarshahi ek naye varg kii shakl leti ja rahi he
 Even though Soviet society has not reached the state of state capitalism, but its condition is like a lesser state of workers
 trotski ke vichaaron kii vishesh baat yah thi ki unamem marxvad ko har samasya kii achook aushadhi ke rup main dekhne kii pravritiyon kaa virodh nihit tha
 Similarly, he was also against pushing various fields of art-literature and knowledge in a particular direction in the name of Marxism
 apane in radical vichaaron ke baavjood ve party kaa bahumat apane paksh main nahin kar sake
 Within the party, he was seen as a leader who could provide charismatic leadership in case of a crisis, but was not interested in dealing with the everyday ups and downs within the party, and his intellectual brilliance i like to be alone
 jab trotski kii ummiido ke mutabik europe main kranti nahin hui, to unhone vishwa-kranti kaa lakshya chhod kar keval ek desh main samaajwaad kaa nirmaan karne main lag jane kii stalineey pariyojna ko iskaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 Trotsky has never believed that the leninist-bolshevik idea of party and politics is at the root of the Stalinist mistakes, which has led to a single state-run state becoming its captive society
 darasal, trotski ne jivan ke tisare daur main nishkasana bhogate hue bhi 1903 se 1914 ke bich kii gayi lenin or bolshevikwaad kii apni kathor aalochanaon ko kabhi nahin doharaaya

 "pate" constructed from "patis" generally ranges from 1 by 1 or 2 by 2 sq
 Ft
 Within homes to 10 by 8 sq
ft in mohallas
 gharon ke bheetar paaton kii banaavat evam sundarata kii bhinnata unamem vyakt pratishtha evam sammaan kii bhinnata ke arth liye hue hoti he
 These pats are used to keep a plate of guests' food or ceremonial items, to place the bride and groom in marriage, etc
 lakdi ke saadhaaran paaton kii apeksha chaandi ke kalatmak pate ucch str, pratishtha evam sammaan ke dyotak hote hai
 Vishal patte located in the mohallas are of three types: First: The palates built and established in the past by the benevolent persons of the King of Bikaner, who have been a symbol of their political and administrative dominance, social prestige, economic prosperity and cultural contributions
 doosraa: katipay jatiyon dwaara sthapit pate, jo jati vishesh kii ucch sthiti ko ingit karne ke saath-saath antarjaateey sambandhon, jaateey sadasyon ke antarsambandhon, saarvajanik kriyakalapon, athwa gatividhiyaan, daan-punya kii kriyaaon aadi ke kendra rahe hai
 Third: Pats established by some kind in a caste or neighborhood, which shows the prestige / prosperity of the caste-specific family
 ye pate paariwarik, vaivaahik, jaateey, aarthik, raajnneetik, dharmik, aanushthanik, saahitiyik, jansanchaar aadi vibhinn kriyakalapon ke jatil sankul hai jo aaj bhi astitv main hai
 Prakotayukta is part of the Pata culture in the city of Bikaner
 saamaanya jan dwaara is shahar ke jivan ko pata samskruti kaha jaataa he
 Before explaining the Pata culture and the cultural context of the Pats, the meaning of culture and the structure of culture has to be discussed
 pata aitihaasik evam paramparawaadi shahar bikaner kii moulik visheshta he jise drishy rup main parkotayukta shahar main jaateey aadhaar par based vibhinn chaukon, guwadon, mohallon main saarvajanik rup se dekha ja saktaa he
 In general, Pata is a meeting or chaupal made of wood or iron on which the residents of Mohalla sit and share their happiness and sorrow
 lekin saamaajik evam saskruthik drushti se pata parkotayukta shahar kii niamak ikai he, jis par anek paramparaayen evam reeti-rivaaj sampann hote hai
 Hence the meaning of pats can be explained in two meanings
 pata sanskrit bhashaa ke shabd sanskrit: paat se bana he jiskaa arth do kinaaron ke bich kii duuri arthath nadiyon ke do taton ke bich main jo duriyaan hoti he vah paat kehalaati he
 In the same way, the unit that determines the extent of social intercourse between two persons or two castes is called Pata, ie the place where the distance between normal and specific persons or between upper and lower castes is called Pata
 jo prarambh main vaicharik tha, kaalaantar main sthanik ho gaya or bhautik pratimaan ke rup main ubhar kar saamne aayaa
 But currently this meaning is becoming weaker
 pata samskruti kaa ek bhaag he lekin parkotayukta shahar main yah apane-aap main samskruti he
 In simple parlance the culture of this city is called Pata culture
 vastav main pata bhautik drishyman vastu he jo saarvajanik rup se uplabdh he tathaa mook darshak ke rup main gatiheen magar chetan he
 But the Pats have a cultural area
 inase sambandhit anek pratimaan he
 It is a complex of many cultural elements
 is par janm se lekar mrityuparyant tak ke sanskaar sampann hote hai
 The presence of pats is necessary in religious and social festivals
 pata purvajon kii karmasthali he
 That is why the 80-year-old woman in this percolated city must wear a veil while going ahead
 jabaki paaton par unki santaan ke baraabar ke vyakti baithe hote hai
 When the woman was asked why did you wear the veil? All the people sitting on the pats are like your children, so the reply of that woman was that Pata is the place of identification and sitting of our grandfather-in-law and father-in-law
 unki aatma to paaton par hi rahati hai kyonki unhone puraa jivan inhen paaton par bitaayaa he
 From this point of view, in the anthropological sense, Pata is a "totem", which is a sacred object as well as acts of social control
 parampara amoort evam alikhit hoti he
 Over time, written literature is based on evidence
 atah parampara to shaashvat he, jo swatah viksit hoti hai or dhire-dhire saamaajik viraasat va saamaajik pratimaan ban jaati he
 It is a difficult task to trace the origin of the tradition of Pata and Pata
 500 varshon ke parkotayukta shahar bikaner ke itihaas main paaton kii utpatti ke bare main aitihaasik pramaan khojane ke dor kuch aitihaasik pramaan mili jinke aadhaar par paaton kii utpatti ke bare main nimna nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai- 1
 Poet Shri Udaychand Khattargachh Mathen's work titled "bikaner Ghazal" 1709 contains reference to the chowk in the city and market description poetry, which states that - arthath bazaar ke bichombich chowk lage hue hai jin par seth-sahukaar aakar baithte hai or vyapaar, parivaar tathaa puure sansar kii baaten karte hai
 Similarly, Goda chowki is also mentioned in this composition
 goda vaastushastri tha jisane bhandasar jain mandir kaa nirmaan kiya or usee kii yaad main parkotayukta shahar ke rangdi chowk main pathar kii sundar chaowkee banaai gai he
 This garrison was famous at that time for its beautiful carvings
 yah chaowkee pate ke aakaar kii bani hui thi, shodhvetta krishnakumar sharma ke anusaar isi chaowkee par pagaudi style main saat pate rakhe jate the
 The famous Bhandasar Jain temple is built in the Pagodi style itself
 kud logon kaa kahana he mandir kaa nirmaan paaton kii is style ko dekhne ke baad kiya gaya to anya logon kaa mat he ki vaastukar goda kii yaad main yah pagauda style ke paaton kii parampara prarambh kii gai
 For the last 10 years, the Pagoda style tradition of placing seven seats on one floor has ended

 Pata is shown in place of the throne of the king
 isi prakaar usamen godairi chaowkee, bothra chaowkee, maluwaan ri chaowkee kaa chithran kiya gaya he
 On the way there is a depiction of Pats in the crowd of people
 3
 bikaner ke shaasha joravarasingh ke shashan main mohataa dewan bakhtawarsingh ke makaan ke aage pata rakhaa hua he
 It is mentioned in the book of Harsudas Mohta
 dewan sahab kii haveli va shaan-shaukat se tatkaaleen sardaar amarsingh va raja joravarasingh ke chachere bhai unke virdohi ban gayi
 Diwan Bakhtawar Singh later replaced his brother Gajsinghji as the ruler of Bikaner after the death of a childless ruler, replacing Amarsingh
 in aitihaasik pramaanon ke aadhaar par bikaner shahar main 1708 se paaton kii parampara chalati aa rahi he lekin lok-manyataon ke aadhaar par raav bika ke samay se hi paaton kii parampara chalati aa rahi he kyonki shaasha swayan paaton par baithkar hi shashan chalaate the
 Throning in the local language is called "sitting"
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki prarambh main pate saradaaron ke deron main lagate the
 When Rao Bika asked his father Rao Jodha for the royal symbol, he promised to give it after his death
 jab unki mrityu ho gai tab unhone apane sautele bhai raav sujaji se ye chihn maange to unhone dene se manaa kar diya
 Rao Bika then attacked Jodhpur and was forced to give the royal symbol to the King of Jodhpur
 yah raav bika kii pratham raajnneetik jeet thi
 These emblems include Chhatra, Chavar, Shield, Talwar, Katar, eighteen bhauji idol of Goddess Naganechiji, Takht, Karand, Bhawardhol, Barisal Nagada, Dalsigar Ghoda and Bhojai
 jinamein takht rajdurbar kaa pavitra singhaasana he
 Its shape is similar to that of Pate
 jab raav bika is takht par baithe tab unhone apane saradaaron se kaha tha ki ââham baithe apane darbar paat, tum sab baitho apane dere paatââ arthath aaj se ham darbar main singhaasana par baith gayi hai or tum sab bhi apane dere main singhaasana par baitho
 From the same day, the roof started appearing in front of the camp
 iske alaava jaateey panchayaton kii bahiyon main bhi paaton kii sthapana kaa ullekh miltaa he
 For example, in the book of Surdasani Panchayat, the construction of pats is mentioned in 1809
 lakhotiyon ke chowk main lakhotiyon kii panchayat bahi main bhi panchayat kaa pata bhi 18veen shatabdi main maujuud tha
 Thus the tradition of Pats has been going on in the folk life since 18th century in the city of Bikaner
 jabaki lok-manyataon ke aadhaar par yah 500 varshon se bikaner main raav bika ke samay se prachlit he
 Initially, stone posts were installed in each neighborhood instead of wooden pallets
 parkotayukta shahar bikaner main paaton ke samajashastreey adhyayan ke liye vibhinn mohalle, chowk, guwad main sthit paaton ke bare main praathmik tathyon ke sankalan hetu paaton par baithne vaale vruddh evam prauji uttardaataaon tathaa mohalle ke gharon main se chune gayi uttardaataaon se vyaktigat saakshaatkaar ke dauraan nimnlikhit jaankariyaan praapt hui hai- 1
 There are currently 93 pates located in various mohallas in the city of Parkotayukta
 2
 1950 se pehle bikaner shahar main lagbhag 120 pate sthit the
 In this way, 27 parts disappeared at present
 3
 vartmaan main sthit paaton main 14 paaton kaa puraane paaton kii jagah navnirmaan karaayaa gaya he
 4
 Presently 70 percent of the Pats are supervised by the ethnic panchayat
 20 pratishat pate parivaar-vishesh dwaara tathaa 10 pratishat paaton kii dekharekh samuhik rup se kii jaati he
 5
 90% of the pots in the city of Parkotiyukta are completely made of wood
 10 pratishat pate lohe ke bane hai
 But the straps are wooden
 inke alaava 22 pratishat pate kalatmak evam adhik pair vaale hai shesh saadhaaran hai
 6
 During inspection of the pats, it was found that 30 percent of the pats have become very old
 unki sthiti atyant kharaab he
 Due to lack of care for a long time, they have reached a shabby state
 7
 parkotayukta shahar ke prayek hindu va jain parivaar main paaton kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 8
 Various types of pats have been seen in the houses, such as silver plated, artistic patte, wood carved patte, beautiful painting pot and ordinary wooden patta in the ordinary family
 parkotayukta shahar ke surveykshan va nirikshan ke dauraan praapt tathyon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki pata ek jatil saanskrithik skool he, jiske anek swaroop, prakaarya evam aayam hai
 The utility of the Pats is a paradigm in the life of the city of Bikaner
 jise nimnlikhit tathyagat vivaran ke aadhaar par spasht kiya ja rahaa he - The city of Bikaner, which the locals call Dharmanagar, was also called Chota Kashi before Independence, because there are some religious events such as yagnas, rituals, narrations and recitals
 yahan jitne bhi dharmik karmkand yojit kiye jate hai unki khaas pahchaan paaton kii dharmik manyata evam unka upyog he
 Pats are used everywhere in life
 chaahe mandir ho yaa makaan yaa dharmik sanskaar, sabhi jagah paaton ko pavitra mana jaataa he
 Because wood, wind, fruit, running water and fire are considered holy in the scriptures
 pate lakdi ke bane hote hai isliye ve dharmik karmkandon main pavitra maane jate hai
 Another island palace built on Lake Pichola
 yah mahal maharaja karan singh dwaara banwaaya gaya tha, kintu maharaja jagat singh ne iskaa vistaar karaayaa

 The Saha equation was devised in 1920 by the well-known Indian astronomer Meghnad Saha
 iske dwaara varnpatt ke aadhaar par taron ke vargeekaran kii vyakhya kii gai he
 For a gas composed of a single atomic species, the Saha equation is written: where: In the case where only one level of ionization is important, we have n 1 = ne { \ displaystyle n_ {1} = n_ {e}} and defining the total density n as n = n 0 + n 1 { \ displaystyle n = n_ {0} + n_ {1}}, the Saha equation simplifies to: where Îµ { \ displaystyle \ epsilon } is the energy of ionization
 The Saha equation is useful for determining the ratio of particle densities for two different ionization levels
 The most useful form of the Saha equation for this purpose is where z denotes the partition function
 The Saha equation can be seen as a restatement of the equilibrium condition for the chemical potentials: Gunpeshwar has a village in Krishna district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
