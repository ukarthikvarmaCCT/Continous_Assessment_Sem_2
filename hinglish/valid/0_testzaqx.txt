 Former Australian Test player Bruce Yardley, who was an off-spinner himself during his time, was tasked with ensuring whether Muralitharan was able to bowl all his balls with the same vigor as he did during the 2004 Test match conditions

 Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young confirmed that "the accent he has given is Muralitharan

 Muralitharan is the first off-spinner to have a wrist spin in the history of the game
 ve lambe samay tak lagaataar gendbaaji karte hai, phir bhi aam taur par aakraamak rahete hai
 His unique bowling style is accompanied by a short run-up with an open shoulder and is completed with an acutely ejected ball from the wrist that caused him to mistakenly be considered a leg-spinner by Alan Bordner early in his career

 During the second Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day 1995, Australian umpire Darrell Hair accused Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan of throwing the ball in front of a crowd of 55,239
 The off-spinner was given a no-ball seven times in three overs by Heyer who believed that the then 23-year-old had twisted and straightened his arm while throwing the ball, an illegal style in cricket
 is naatak khel ke duusare satr ke madhya main ghatit hua
 Muralitharan bowled two overs before the lunch break by umpire Steve Dunn or members of the field during which the umpires stood at hair square leg and the balls went off without incident
 2:34 pm baje unhone ampire hair ke sire yaa dakshini sire se akraman shuru kiya
 Muralitharan's third over was vacated in which all the balls were once again validated, but in his fourth over, Hair called him a no-ball twice for throwing the fourth and sixth balls
 ampire ne unke paanchaven over main bhi duusari, chauthi or chhathi gendon main unhen lagaataar teen baar no-ball qaraar diya
 When this bowler stood by surprise with his hands on his hips, a five-time no-ball provoked Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga for an immediate response from the field at 3:03 pm to consult his team management Moved out
 vah 3:08 pm par waapas laute or muralidharan se gendbaaji karana jari rakhaa jinhen unke chathe over main duusari or chhathi gendon par phir se do baar no-ball diya gaya
 At 3:17 pm, the bowler was eliminated from Ranatunga, although he again picked him up to bowl at 3:30 pm from the end of Umpire Dun
 However, in his book "decision Maker", Heyer states that by the end of the tea break he had said that he would call Muralitharan a no-ball even though he bowled from any end, he did not
 muralidharan ne kisi no–ball ke bina anya 12 overon kii gendbaaji puri kii or mark wa ko out karne ke baad 18–3–58–1 ke aankadon ke saath din kii samaapti kii
 Controversy increased during the two-day long Australian innings
 no–ball qaraar die jane ke baad muralidharan ne ampire steve dan ke chor se square leg par steve dan yaa hair ke kisi virodh ke bina agle 32 overon kii gendbaaji kii
 The Sri Lankan camp raged after the incident but the ICC came to the rescue of Heyer, citing a list of non-result steps taken to determine the legitimacy of Muralitharan's style
 gendbaaji chor se muralidharan ko no-ball qaraar dekar hair ne us adhikaar kii avhelnaa kii jiske anusaar saamaanya rup se thro karne kaa nirnay lenaa squaire leg ampaire kaa adhikaar mana jaataa he
 Dunn had to break this tradition to support his partner

 Despite the consent of the body controlling the game, the Australian Cricket Board favored it on the basis that it could trigger an interrogation of the umpires by the teams after every match and meant that the throwing dispute In the coming weeks, the World Cup will also provoke controversy in the series
 srilankai is baat se niraash the ki unhen koi spashtikaran nahin mila tha or unhone apane gendbaaj ko un mainchon main khilaane kaa faisla kiya jisamen hair dwaara ampiring nahin kii jaayegi or ve yah jaananaa chaahate the ki anya ampire hair ke faisle kaa samarthan karenge yaa nakaar denge
 Muralitharan's action was approved by the ICC in 1996 after a biochemical analysis at the University of Western Australia and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
 unhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki unki style ne "gend phenkane kaa drushti bhram" paidaa kar diya tha

 This wicket ensured Sri Lanka's victory by an innings and 193 runs, beating the hosts 3–0 in the series
 muralidharan ne prayek pari main chah wicket lekar 20veen baar ek test match main 10 yaa isse adhik wicket lene kaa karnama kiya
 Although he was unable to surpass Warne's record of 708 wickets in Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in November 2007, he managed to get just four wickets in two Tests
 muralidharan ne 3 disambar 2007 ko candi main england ke khilaaf pehle test match ke dauraan sarvaadhik test viketon kaa record phir se hasil kar liya
 The spinner bowled England's Paul Collingwood as his 709th Test victim and overtook Shane Warne in that order
 muralidharan ne yah mukaan apane 116wein test main hasil kiya – worne se 29 match kam – or unhone australian khilaadi ke 25
41 kii tulana main keval 21
77 ran prati wicket kharch kiya
 This was Muralitharan's 61st wicket-taking feat
 worne kaa maananaa tha ki muralidharan is khel se sanyas lene se pehle "1000 wicket" le jaayenge
 purv record dharak courtney walsh kaa bhi mat tha ki agar muralidharan apni viketon kii bhukh ko kaayam rakhte hai to yah sambhav ho jayega
 khud muralidharan kaa maananaa tha ki isaki sambhaavna he ki ve is mile ke pathar tak pahunch jaayenge
 Muralitharan and Ajanta Mendis made fun of India's strong batting reputation in July 2008 when Sri Lanka won the first Test in Colombo by an innings and a record margin of 239 runs
 muralidharan ne 110 par 11 wicket ke aankade ke saath match puraa kiya jab 377 ranon kii badhat praapt karne ke baad duusari pari main bharat ko 138 ranon par samet diya gaya
 He was well supported by debutant Ajanta Mendis, an unorthodox spinner bowling with the utmost variety who took eight wickets in his first match
 muralidharan kaa maananaa tha ki mendis ke ubharne se unke apane kariyar ko lanbaa khinchne main madad milegi
 36 varshiya muralidharan or 23 varshiya mendis ne pehle test main bharat kii karaari haar main ek durjey saajhedaari kii, donon ne 20 main se 19 wicket aapas main baant liye
 "if he performs like this he will definitely get a lot of wickets in international cricket
 Now that he has arrived, i think i can play Test cricket for a few more years
 50 overs in a Test innings Bowling is very difficult
 ab agar main keval 30–35 over karata hoon or vah mujhase adhik gendbaaji karata he to mere liye kaam aasaan ho jayega
 In July 2007, Muralitharan achieved his career-best Test bowling score of 920 points based on the LG ICC Player Rankings
 yah test cricket main ek spin gendbaaj dwaara hasil kiya gaya ab tak kaa sarvocch darja he
 It also puts him in fourth place in the LG icc's best bowling rating so far

 They have taken 7 or more wickets in an innings against five countries, the names of these countries are England, India, South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe
 Muttiah Muralitharan has also done five wickets at least five times against all other Test teams

 He currently holds the highest wicket / match ratio for any bowler taking more than 200 Test wickets and has represented it in 178 out of 175 Tests played by Sri Lanka
 bangladesh or zimbabwe ko chhodkar baaki tiimon ke khilaaf muralidharan ne 108 test maichon main 624 wicket liye
 Warne took 691 wickets in 142 Tests, leaving his matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe by comparison
 murali kaa 24

 Muralitharan has won the best player of the match award in Test cricket 18 times
 muralidharan ke khilne ke dinon ke dauraan isisi ke future tour kaarykram main srilanka or kai anya tiimon ko ek samaan str kaa khel kaa maidan dene se inkaar kar diya gaya
 As a result, Muralitharan never toured South Africa after December 2002, nor did he ever play a Test at the spin-friendly Sydney Cricket Ground
 anya safal antarrashtriya gendbaajon ke khilaaf muralidharan kii gendbaaji ricard kii ek anya tulana desh ke baahar unka kariyar record he
 Muralitharan has received criticism that he has tasted great success by taking wickets on indigenous ground which are far more spin-friendly than other international pitches
 srilanka ke baahar unke test maichon ke record ke ek twarit vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki unhone 52 maichon main 26
24 ran prati wicket kii ausat se 278 wicket liya he jo 60

 Similarly, spin bowling rival Shane Warne retired "overseas" at an average of 25
50 and a strike rate of 56
7 with a slightly better record of 362 wickets from 73 matches
 test cricket kii vividhtaon ke kaaran jin maidaanon par match khele gaye or jin maidaanon par vipakshi team ne unke khilaaf match khechaa, is aadhaar par sheersh str ke khilaadiyon kii gunvattta kii tulana is tarah se kiya janaa bahut hi mushkil or vyaktiparak he
 However, it is clear that Muralitharan played far better on an average of less than 16 runs per wicket, playing on indigenous ground with Test novices Zimbabwe and Bangladesh
 crickinfo ke aankadon ke sampadak es rajesh ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki 2000–2009 kaa dashak 1940 ke dashak se test ballebaajon ke liye sarvshereshth 10-varsh kaa samay rahaa he
 Muralitharan was clearly the leading Test wicket taker during this period, taking 565 wickets at an average of 20
97 despite the dominance of the bat on the ball
 shen warn ne isi dashak ke dauraan 25
17 kii ausat se 357 wicket hasil kiya
 Among the spinners who have taken more than 100 wickets in Tests, only John Briggs, Jim Laker, Bill o'reilly and Cleary Grimmett have a better bowling average than 25

1 overs, more accurately
 muralidharan ne test cricket kii ek pari main paanch yaa adhik wicket lene kaa aankada 67 baar chuaa he, jo ki ek vishwa record he
 In comparison, Shane Warne, who is at number two, has been able to do this only 37 times
 12 agast 1993 ko muralidharan ne khetrama stadium main bharat ke viruddh apane ek divasiy antarrashtriya kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi or 10 overon main 38 ran par ek wicket hasil kiya tha
 Praveen Amre was his first ODI wicket

 On 9 April 2002, Muralitharan achieved an ODI bowling rating of a career-high 913 points based on the LG ICC Player Rankings
 yah ek divasiy antarrashtriya maichon main ek spin gendbaaj dwaara praapt sarvocch darja he
 It also places him fourth in the LG ICC Best ODI Bowling Ratings
 2006 main muralidharan kii gendon par ek divasiy antarrashtriya pariyon main 'doosraa' sarvaadhik ran thoka gaya tha
 The Australians, especially Adam Gilchrist, attacked Muralitharan's bowling more than usual at the time
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki oriai maichon main australiaayyon ke khilaaf muralidharan kaa record bahut acha nahin rahaa he or yah us samay baar phir se sabit ho gaya jab 2007 ke vishwa cap ke final match main ve aprabhavi rahe; unako sataane vaale pramukh khilaadi the gilcrist
 Muralitharan has played in four Cricket World Cup tournaments of 1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007
 muthaiya muralidharan ko april 2008 main west indies daure kii srilankai ek-divasiy team main shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 The chairman of the selectors, Ashantha de Mel, explained the reason for not selecting him, saying, "we know they can still play in the next World Cup if they are properly looked after, so we can give them big matches and Asian We want to use it economically in order to be safe for the upcoming World Cup to be held in the subcontinent, where Muralitharan will be involved as a threat
 " muralidharan ke paas ek divasiy antarrashtriya maichon main kariyar sarvaadhik viketon kii sankhya he, ve 5 farvari 2009 main akram akram se aage nikal gaye the
 Akram took 502 wickets in 356 matches
 3 farvari 2009 ko muralidharan ne colombo main bharat ke viruddh tisare oriai main apane 327wein match main yuvaraj singh ko out kiya tha jab unhone akram ke record kii barabari kii thi
 He has also won 13 Man of the Match awards in this form of the game
 aam taur par number 11 par ballebaaji karne vaale ek aakraamak nichle kram ke ballebaaj, muralidharan leg kii taraf peeche hatakar slog karne ke liye jane jate hai
 Sometimes they can cause trouble for bowlers due to their unconventional and adventurous batting style
 ek baar england ke khilaaf ek test match main elex tuder ko khelte samay ve gend ko hook karne kii koshish main peeche apane leg stump kii ore chale gaye the or shot maarane ke baad isse alag jameen par gir gaye the
 He was strangely run out in a match against New Zealand when Kumar stepped out of his crease to congratulate Sangakkara, who had then completed his century with a single; The New Zealand player had not yet returned the ball to the wicketkeeper, thus the ball was still in the process of play
 unka 67 ranon kaa sarvocch score bharat ke viruddh candi main 2001 main aayaa jisamen teen chakke or paanch chauke shaamil the
 He has contributed valuable runs on several occasions including 30 runs with 5 fours at the Oval against England in 1998, 38 against England at Galle in 2003, 43 against Australia at Kandy in 2004, Colombo in 2005
 36 runs against the West Indies in India and 33 runs without being dismissed against Bangladesh in the final of the 2009 tri-series in Bangladesh, their highest ever score in odis

 Muralitharan's strike rate in Test cricket is around 70 and he has scored 55% of his Test match runs in the form of fours and sixes
 chaminda vaas ke saath milakar muralidharan srilanka ke liye test maichon main 10wein wicket kii bhagidaari ke liye sarvaadhik ranon kaa record rakhte hai
 The pair added 79 runs for the last wicket against Australia at the Asgiriya Stadium in March 2004
 muralidharan ke paas number 11 par ballebaaji karte hue test cricket main bhi sarvaadhik ran banane kaa record he
 Muralitharan currently holds the record for most dismissals for zero in international cricket with 59 total dismissals
 muralidharan ne apane upar thro karne kaa aarope lagane vaale australian darshakon dwaara niyamit rup se sawaalon ke jariye tang kiye jane ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaayi he - unako nishaanaa banaakar kiya gaya ek aam majaak "no ball" kaa he
 After the then Australian Prime Minister John Howard's statement in 2004 that Muralitharan was a "fugitive", Muralitharan indicated that he would stop touring Australia from now on
 srilanka ke purv coach or purv australian test cricketer tom mudi ne kaha tha ki ve australian darshakon dwaara muthaiya muralidharan ko nishaanaa banaakar kii gayi apmanjanak pratikriya or nakaaratmak dhyanakarshan se sharminda hai
 Moody said that "as an Australian when i was in Australia with the Sri Lankan team or playing against them in the World Cup, it was the only situation in the entire cricket world where we would have had such a shameful act on a cricketer saw
 " During the 2008 CB series in Australia, some members of the Sri Lankan team, including Muralitharan, were the target of an egg-throwing incident in Hobart
 srilanka ke cricket chayankarta don anurasiri ko ek anda maaraa gaya tha jabaki muralidharan or do anya khilaadiyon ko logon se bhari ek car se gaali di gayi thi jab ve ek restaraan se waapas apane hotel kii ore ja rahe the
 As the incident took place at night, it is not clear whether Muralitharan was actually the target of the accused
 iske baavjood ki srilankai team ke australian coach trevor belis ne is ghatana ko "koi ghatana nahin" kahkar iske mahatva ko kam kar diya, cricket australia ne unke aasapaas suraksha or kadi kar di
 In response to this episode, Muralitharan remarked "when you come to Australia, you expect these events
" " At the conclusion of Muralitharan's Test cricket career, author Rahul Bhattacharya summarizes Muralitharan's case as follows: "murali is often described as a fox
 yah sahi lagata he
 Unlike hedgehog bowlers who follow the same broad idea, Murali had many ways to chase like a fox
 ek lomadee kii hi tarah, ve jhund main shikaar nahin karte the
 Like a fox, he allowed himself to be mercilessly hunted for the sport in some parts of the world
 Fox hunting was banned in England a few years ago, but it is still legal in Australia
 " On 7 July 2010, Muttiah Muralitharan formally announced his retirement from Test cricket at a press conference in Colombo
 unhone is baat kii pushti kar di ki 18 july 2010 main bharat ke khilaaf shuru hone vaala pehla test unka aakhri test hoga, lekin unhone yah sanket diya ki agar aavashyak samajha gaya to ve 2011 ke vishwa cap tak ek divasiy antarrashtriya maichon main khelnaa chaahate the jiskaa sah-aayojan srilanka dwaara kiya jayega
 unhone 1996 main srilanka kii vishwa cap kii jeet ko ek cricketer ke rup main apana sabase mahanatam pal bataaya
 He also said that he had some regrets during his 19-year playing career
 "dakshin africa, australia or bharat main koi bhi test match nahin jeetna aisa hi afsos he
 But I'm sure we will win very soon
 " apane aakhri match kii shuruyaat main muralidharan 800 viketon se keval aath wicket dur the
 Muralitharan still needed a wicket to reach this milestone in the fall of the ninth wicket in India's second innings
 90 minute ke pratirodh ke baad muralidharan over or apane test kariyar kii aakhri gend par aakhri bhartiya ballebaaj pragyan ojha ko out karne main sakasham rahe
 By doing so, he became the first bowler to reach 800 wickets in Test cricket
 srilanka ne yah match 10 wicket se jeeta, yah karnama unhone saatvin baar or bharat ke khilaaf duusari baar kiya tha
 Muttiah Muralitharan has several world records and several first places: 2002 main vijaden ne itihaas ke mahanatam cricketron ko darja dene ke ek prayaas main sabhi test maichon kaa ek sankhyikeey vishleshan karaayaa, isamen muralidharan ko ab tak ke sarvshereshth test gendbaaj kaa darja diya gaya
 However, two years ago, Muralitharan was not named as one of the five Wisden cricketers of the century
 purv austrailian captain steve wa unhen "gendbaaji kaa don breadman" kehete the
 Muralitharan was chosen as the leading Wisden cricketer in the world in 2000 and 2006
 15 navambar 2007 ko test cricket main wicket lene vaale do agrani gendbaajon, shen warn or muralidharan ke naam par banaayi gayi warn-muralidharan trophy kaa anaavaran kiya gaya
 The trophy depicts images of each spin bowler holding a cricket ball in each hand
 is trophy kii bhidant australia or srilanka ke bich bhavishya kii sabhi test shrinkhalaaon main hogi
 On 3 December 2007, just hours after Muralitharan became the leading Test wicket-taker in Test cricket, Merlebone Cricket Club announced that it had unveiled an image of the Sri Lankan off-spinner at Lord's
 usee din srilanka main dak vibhaag kii dak tikat beuro ne muthaiya muralidharan dwaara banaae gaye record ko chihnit karne ke liye 5 rupee ke mulya-varg ke saath ek vrittakar dak tikat jari kiya
 The circular design was meant to represent a cricket ball
 australian sangeetkaar alston coach ne us samay duniya bhar main dilchaspee paidaa kar di jab unhone muralidharan ke liye ekmaatr aadhikarik shradhanjali geet record kiya, yahaan tak ki is geet kaa zikr bibisi ke test match special main bhi kiya gaya tha
 The song video of Muralitharan was also released when he broke the world record
 10 janvari 2008 ko srilanka kii sansad ne muthaiya muralidharan ke test cricket main sarvaadhik wicket lene vaale gendbaaj banane ke vishwa record tod pradarshan ke liye unhen sammanit kiya tha
 This is the first time a player has been honored by the country's highest legislature
 candi main kendriya prantiy parishad ne pallekele main antarrashtriya cricket stadium kaa nayaa naam muthaiya muralidharan ke naam par rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 Throughout his international career, Muralitharan has been accused of violating the rules of the game in order to keep his bowling arm straight while throwing the ball
 haalanki unhen teen baar uddhrut kiya gaya he, baad main kiye gaye jaivaracinic pareekshan se isisi dwaara unhen is aarope se mukt kar diya gaya or gendbaaji jari rakhane kii anumati di gayi
 Biochemical testing conducted on four occasions fueled the discussion as to whether his style was in fact illegal or his alleged unique ability to produce extra movement from both the shoulder and wrist to throw a 'second' without straightening the elbow
 a vision made is illusion
 muralidharan kii gendbaaji style ne gend phenkane ke dauraan unki gend vaali baanh ko sidhaa rakhane par khel ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya tha yaa nahin isaki praarambhik chintaaen 1995 main australia ke melborn main boxing de test match ke dauraan australian ampire derel hair dwaara ek avaidh style ke liye unhen saat baar "no-ball" qaraar dene ke baad ek khule vivaad ke rup main shuru ho gayi thi
 Ten days later, on 5 January 1996, Sri Lanka faced the West Indies in Brisbane in the seventh ODI of the tri-world Series competition
 apane antarrashtriya kariyar kii shuruyaat main ampire ross emmersan ne muralidharan ke pehle over main unhen teen baar no-ball qaraar diya, duusari gend par do baar or teesri gend par do baar
 yah us faisle ke saamaan tha jo boxing de ko hair dwaara diya gaya tha or emmersan ne apana yah faisla gendbaaji chor se diya tha jabaki unke saathi chupchaap khadey the
 The main difference was that many no-balls were leg-breaks rather than the bowler's usual off-breaks
 farvari 1996 main vishwa cap se thik pehle muralidharan ko honkong uniwarsity of science and technology main profesar rabindra gunetilake ke supervijan ke tahat jaev rasinic vishleshan se guzarana padaa, jinhone muralidharan kii baanh main ek janmajaat dosha kaa uddhran dete hue pareekshan kii gayi sthitiyon main unki style ko vaid qaraar diya jo unhen ise puri tarah se sidhaa karne main aksham banaata he, lekin baanh ke puri tarah se sidhaa hone kaa abhas detaa he
 However, under the basic law, a bowler's arm should not be completely straight, which is a violation of a legitimate style of throwing a ball
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki unki style ne "thro karne kaa ek drushtibhram" paidaa kar diya tha
 Based on this evidence, the ICC approved Muralitharan to continue bowling
 haalanki 1998–99 main australia daure main muralidharan kii gendbaaji style par andeh kaayam rahaa, australia main edilade ovel main england ke khilaaf ek ekadivasiy antarrashtriya match ke dauraan ross emmersan dwaara unhen ek baar phir se thro karne par no-ball qaraar de diya gaya
 The Sri Lankan team had almost abandoned the match but the game resumed following instructions received from the Chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka
 iske parinaam swaroop baad main us samay ke srilanka team ke captain arjuna rantunga par jurmaana kiya gaya or khel se ek nilambit pratibandh laga diya gaya
 It was later revealed that by the time of this match, Emerson had been on leave from his non-cricketing work due to a stress-related illness and had retreated from the rest of the series
 muralidharan ko agle pareekshanon ke liye england or perth bheja gaya or ek baar phir se unhen manjuuri de di gayi
 At no stage did Muralitharan request the ICC to change its style or give it a new look
 apane kariyar ke is mukaam tak muralidharan mukhya rup se do tarah kii gendbaaji karte rahe yani of-brake or topspinner
 unhone abhi tak 'doosraa' main maharath hasil nahin kii thi
 Muralitharan continued to bowl, taking his 500th Test wicket in the second Test match against Australia in Kandy on 16 March 2004
 shrinkhalaa ke ant main unki 'doosraa' gend par match referi kris broad ne aadhikarik taur par sawaal uthaaya
 western australia uniwarsity main ek optical moshan capchar system kaa istemaal kar muralidharan dwaara 'doosraa' prakaar kaa gend phenkate hue unke us haath kaa triayami–kinemetics pranali se maapan kiya gaya
 The average extension of his elbow while throwing the 'second' type of ball by Muralitharan was 14 ° which was later reduced to an average of 10
2 ° after a remedial test at the university
 western australia uniwarsity ke adhyayan dwaara isisi ko bheji gayi report kaa nishkarsh yah tha ki muralidharan ke 'doosraa' ne spinneron ke liye isisi kii nirdhaarit kohni vistaar seemaa kaa ulanghan kiya tha
 Under the original ball throwing rules of cricket, the substitute umpire was obliged to call such a ball a "no-ball" of which they did not fully agree that it was at all appropriate
 is niyam par ampiron main koi bhedbhaav nahin tha
 These rules were changed in the year 2000 to define the validity more clearly according to which an acceptable extension of 5 ° for spinners, 7
5 ° for medium-speed fast bowlers and 10 ° for fast bowlers was given
 
 lekin in aankadon ko lagu karnaa kaaphi mushkil siddh hua kyonki ampire vistaar kii sahi maatra or teen alag-alag sweekaarya aankadon ke bich antar kaa andaja lagane main asamarth the
 Currently, testing is not possible in test match situations
 "when the identification of the elbow and shoulder joint focuses on the collection of data on the field, when a shirt is worn, there are also considerable errors
" kisi match main vibhinn shaareerik harkaton kii kshamta jaise ki segment ind-point ko digitise kar "kohni kaa vistaar", vishesh rup se jab aapke paas segment roteshan ho, aisa karnaa bahut hi mushkil he or isamen trutiyaan ho sakati hai
 This is definitely the case with spin bowlers
 isliye yah aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki vishesh rup se spin gendbaajon ke liye prayogshaala pareekshan ko praathamikta di jaati he jahaan ek uchit pich kii lambaai or ran-ap kii sanrachana taiyaar kii ja sakati he
 This is clearly the only method for test players where the data scientist will therefore be able to live up to a valid investigation
 " a comprehensive ICC study, the results of which were released in November 2004, was done to investigate the "chucking issue"
 ferdinands or kirsting dwaara test match nahin khilne vaale 42 gendbaajon par kiye gaye ek prayogshaala kinemetic vishleshan ne yah nirdhaarit kiya ki dhime or spin gendbaajon ke liye 5° kii seemaa vishesh rup se avyaavhaarik thi
 Due to unavoidable scientific findings, researchers recommend that a flat rate of elbow extension tolerating 15 ° can be used to define an initial demarcation point between bowling and throwing the ball
 purv test khilaadiyon ke ek panel jisamen arvind di silva, anges frager, maaikel holding, tony louis, tim main or isisi ke dev richardsan shaamil the, kai jaivaracinic visheshgyon ke sahyog se isane yah kaha tha ki cricket ke itihaas main sabhi gendbaajon main se 99% gendbaaji karte samay apane haath ko sidhaa karte hai
 Only one player tested did not allegedly violate pre-2000 rules
 inamen se zyaadaatar reporton ko vivaadaaspad rup se prakashit nahin kiya gaya he or is tarah bataaye gaye 99% aankadon ko abhi sabit kiya janaa baaki he
 In fact Muralitharan sparked controversy when he stated in an interview with a Melbourne radio station that Jason Gillespie, Glenn mcgrath and Brett Lee extended their arms 12, 13 and 14–15 degrees, respectively, although this It is not clear from where Muralitharan quoted these figures
 in tippaniyon ke liye srilankai cricket board dwaara muralidharan kii ninda kii gayi thi
 In February 2005, at the icc's annual plenary, the ICC Executive was asked to ratify the panel's recommendations
 sabhi prakaar ke gendbaajon ke liye 15 degree ke vistaar yaa atyadhik vistaar kii sweekruti ke liye in siforeeshon ke aadhaar par isisi ne ek nayaa dishanirdesh jari kiya, is prakaar muralidharan ke 'doosraa' ko vaid mana gaya
 Explaining why the 15-degree level was reached, panel member Angus Fraser said "this is the number that biochemists say it deserves to be visible
" kisi gendbaaj kii style main 15 degree se kam ke vistaar ko nagn ankhon se dekh paanaa mushkil he
 We found this when the hand fish reached the shoulder, the bend volume was around 165 degrees
 bahut hi kam gendbaaj 180 degree tak pahunch pate hai kyonki jod isamen madad nahin karte hai
 
 But when you move beyond 15 degrees you enter an area that starts giving you an unfair advantage and you violate the law
 " Bowling's original decision not to allow 'second' action was widely justified because it was scientifically based

 a team of Australian scientists, including Sri Lankan-born Australian scientist Professor Mahinda Pathegama, conducted a very in-depth analysis of various issues according to the icc's test on Muralitharan, such as the modern technology of artificial information and bio-mechanics when converting a 2D image into a 3D image
 , And image comparison compared to bio-mechanistic assessment for 'second' bowling action, etc

 professor mahinda pathegama dwaara kiye gaye dakshin australia vishvavidhyalay ke adhyayan main tark diya gaya tha ki pashchim australia vishvavidhyalay dwaara pesh kiye gaye richards adhyayan main ek sakht aluminium ke baar kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha jo truti kii maatra saamne laane ke liye sirf kshaitij sataha par gum saktaa tha
 The Pathegama report says "the process used in the test itself has so many flaws, despite the hard aluminum bars, that it makes one believe that if the same process examined the skin of a spin bowler's upper hand If known, the amount of error may be more
 " Vincent Barnes argued in an interview that UWA professor Bruce Elliott, who is also the icc's bio-mechanics, made an interesting invention in his studies of finger spinners
 "unhone kaha tha ki unhone paaya he ki up-mahadweep ke kai gendbaaj 'doosraa' gend ko niyam mutabik daal sakate hai, lekin kakesian yani safed nasl vaale gendbaaj aisa nahin kar sakate
" On 2 February 2006, Muralitharan went through a fourth round of bio-mechanics investigation
 Investigations from previous tours were criticized, saying that during the laboratory tests in July 2004, the slow pace of bowling did not match the circumstances of the match
 un jaanch ke nattejey bataate hai ki ausatan 53

 july, 2004 main england main muralidharan ko baanh kii pattee ke saath gendbaaji karte hue filmaaya gaya tha
 The film was shown on UK Channel 4 during the 2004 Test against England 22 July
 yah vruttchitr bikri ke liye uplabdh nahin he or australia main iskaa prasaaran nahin hua
 Initially, Muralitharan bowled three balls just as he was playing in a match - off-spinner, top-spinner and 'another'
 He then cast the same three types of balls with a bar made of steel, installed in a strong resin
 is pattee ko unke daahine baanh par dhaal diya gaya tha, jisaki lambaai 46 centimetre or vajan sirf ek kilogram ke upar he
 TV presenter Mark Nicholls, who used the bandage himself, confirmed it and said that "when the arm is tied to the bandage, there is no scope for it to bend or bend
" " sabhi teenon genden usee tarah pratikriya kii jis tarah bina pattee ke phenkane par thi
 Yes, these balls could not be bowled at such a speed as the weight of the strip slowed Muralitharan's arm rotation slightly, but the ball still had rotation
 pattee bandhe hone ke baavjood unke ection main jhatka dikhaai diya
 When the film was studied at different speeds, it showed that he was straightening his arm, while it was impossible to do so because of the bandage
 unke kandhe kaa anokhaa ghumaav or kalaayiyon kaa adbhut ection ko dekh aisa bhram paidaa karata he jaise wo apane baanh ko sidhaa kar rahe hai
 The off-spinner said that all these exercises were not to influence the ICC investigation of bowling action but to give confidence to the skeptical public, an inquiry by the match referee Chris Broad in March 2004 against his 'second ball'
 Was started after; This was the third time his bowling was processed
 visden asia cricket ke agast, 2004 ank main die saakshaatkaar main muralidharan ne kaha tha "main samajhataa hum ki ye un logon ke liye ek tathy sabit hoga jo ye kaha karte the ki shaareerik taur par aisi gende phenkna asambhav he jo duusari taraf gumti he
 i have proved that it is possible to bowl the 'second' ball without turning the arm
 " In 2004, Muralitharan himself performed a series of investigations in front of live video cameras at the R
 Premadasa Stadium in Colombo
 maaikel slator or ravi shastri iske gavaah bane
 Muralitharan once again proved that he can do all his types of balls, including the 'second', with a bandage in his arm that prevents the elbow from straightening
 haddi visheshgy doctor mandeep dillan ne kaha ki muralidharan ke paas ek anokhi kshamta he jisase wo apane kandhe ke saath-saath kalai se atirikt gati paidaa karte hai jisase ve 'doosraa' gende bina kohni ko sidhaa kiye phenk sakate hai
 Two of Muralitharan's biggest critics have been former Australian cricketer Dean Jones and former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi
 When Dean Jones later saw Murali bowling, he admitted that he had a wrong opinion about Murali
 westeindies ke purv tej gendbaaj maaikel holding bhi muralidharan ke ek aalochak the, lekin jaanch kiye jane ke baad unhone apni aalochana waapas le lee
 Holding had once stated that he agreed 110% with Bedi's opinion on Murali's bowling action, with Bedi comparing Murali's bowling action to "spear throwing" and more recently "ball throwing"
 isisi ke adhyayan ke baad, adhyayan karne vaale panel ke sadsy ke taur par holding ne kaha tha, "vaigyanik pramaan ati shashakt karne vaala he
 

 When looking at the naked eye, when the action of a bowler seems to be perfectly correct, when it is analyzed with the help of cutting-edge technology today, then the arm of the same bowling action is up to 11 degrees and in many cases straight to 12 degrees
 It seems to be happening
 kanoon kii sakht vyakhya ke tahat ye khilaadi niyamon ko tod rahe hai
 This game will have to face this reality and also have to decide how to incorporate this fact
 " may, 2002 main adam gilcrist ne carlton footbal club main ek kaarykram ke dauraan daawa kiya tha ki muralidharan kaa ection cricket ke niyamon ke mutabik sahi nahin he
 Melbourne newspaper Edge wrote to Gilchrist, "yes, i understand that they do) and i am saying this because if you read the rules of the game, there is no doubt in my mind that they And many others have been doing so in the history of cricket
 " ye tippanee 'doosraa' vivaad ke saamne aane se pehle hi kii gai thi, baavjood iske ki muralidharan ke ection ko isisi ne 1996 or 1999 main manjuuri de di gai thi
 Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for this remark and considered it a violation of the rules under the acb's "harmful public comment"
 2006 main newjiland kii yatra ke dauraan muralidharan ke ek or aalochak, newjiland ke purv captain or cricket vaachak martin kro ne kaha tha ki muralidharan ke 'doosraa' par or kareeb se najar rakhane kii jarurat he, kyonki match ke dauraan unka ection lagaataar kharaab hota dikhataa he
 Earlier in the same year, during the Cowdray Interpretation at Lord's, Martin Crowe demanded that zero tolerance should be maintained at all, rather than 15 degrees, in relation to throwing, and he specifically called Muttiah Muralitharan a chuckle
 kro kii aalochana ke jawaab main isisi mahaprabandhak dev richardsan ne kaha tha ki jaivayantric professor bruce iliyat, doctor paul hurian or mistar mark portsvid ne is maamle main jo vaigyanik pramaan prastut kiye hai, wo adbhut the or spasht kiya ki "kuch gendbaaj, yahaan tak ki jin par kharaab ection kaa shaq nahin he, unki bhi baanh 11 yaa 12 degree sidhaa paae jane kii sambhaavna he
 In addition, some bowlers who see that they are throwing, they will start bowling only with elongated or extended bent elbows
 They are breaking the rules under strict interpretation of the rules - but if we remove all the bowlers who do so, then there will not be a single bowler left for bowling ”
 1999 ke baad se muralidharan kii gendbaaji ke ection par charchaa ke saath-saath jaev-yantriki avadharanaon kaa istemaal karte hue gendbaaji ke ection ko kanoonee taur par paribhaashit karne kii jarurat par kai vaigyanik shodh prakashit ho chuke hai
 These researches have directly helped Muralitharan's official acceptance of bowling action on behalf of the ICC and also convinced the ICC to redefine the rules of bowling action in cricket
 pramukh prakaashan neeche soochibaddh hai: Muralitharan together with his manager Kushil Gunasekhara founded the Foundation of Goodness, a charitable organization in early 2000
 yah sanghathan sinigama kshetra kii bhalaai ke liye patibaddh he or yah puure ilaake main bacchon kii jarurat, shiksha or prashikshan, swasthya suvidha va maansik-saamaajik madad, awaas, aajeevika, khel tathaa paryaavaran samet vibhinn pariyojnaon se sthaneey samudaayon kii madad karata he
 In June 2004, Muralitharan also joined the United Nations World Food Program as an ambassador in the campaign against hunger among school students

 Gupta is a secret practice of Christianity or Christianity
 isamen isaai jis desh me rahete hai vahaan ve dikhaave ke taur par to us desh ke ishwar kii puja karte hai, vahaan kaa dharm maanate hai par vastav main andar se ve isai hote hai or nirantar isai dharm kaa prachaar karte rahete hai
 This practice was adopted when rulers of other religions or society posed a threat to Christianity
 jab krypto chrishchiyan 1 pratishat se kam hote he tab vah us desh ke ishwar ko apana kar apana kaam karte rahete hai
 When they become more numerous, they manifest Christianity
 hollywood film 'agora' main gupt isiyat ko dikhaaya gaya he
 In Greek, the word crypto means hidden or secret
 krypto chrishchiyan * kaa arth hua gupt-isai
 The important thing in this is that crypto-christians are not abusive or negative words
 krypto-chrischiyanity isai dharm kii ek sansthagat practice he
 Under the basic principle of crypto-christianity, in the country where Christians reside, they worship the God of that country, they believe that there is a religion which is their camouflage; But in fact they are Christians from inside and continue to preach Christianity
 krypto chrishchiyan kaa sabase pehla udhaaharan roman samajya main miltaa he jab isaiyat ne shruwati daur main rome main apane pair rakhe the
 Immediately the great Roman emperor Trajan considered Christianity a threat to Roman culture and proposed to all the Roman Christians who were either to abandon Christianity or suffer the death penalty
 roman isaiyon ne mrityu-dand se bachane ke liye isai dharm chhodane kaa naatak kiya or uske baad upar se ve roman devi devataaon kii puja karte rahe, par andar se isaiyat ko maanate the
 The way Muslims are 5–10 percent, they celebrate the law of that country
 par jab 20-30 pratishat hoten hai tab sharia kii maang shuru hoti he, dange hoten he
 Ethnic Cleansing of non-muslims begins as the population increases further
 par, krypto chrishchiyan, musalamaanon jaisi hinsa nahin karte
 When crypto Christians are less than 1 percent, then they continue to do their work by adopting the God of that country and as they become more numerous, they start insulting those deities
 Hollywood kii mashhoor film Agora** har hindu ko dekhni chahie
 It shows that when crypto Christians outnumbered Rome, they began insulting Roman deities
 vartmaan main bharat me bhi krypto chrishchiyan ne pakad banani shuru kii to yahan bhi hindu devi-devataaon, brahmanon ko gaali dene kaa kaam shuru kar diya
 Meaning, the work that took place 2000 years ago in Europe is happening in India today
 haal main professor kedaar mandal dwaara devi durga ko veshya kaha jo ki duusari sadi ke rome kii yaad dilaataa he
 There are many examples of crypto-christians, but the most interesting example is from Japan
 mishaniriyon kaa tathakthith-sant xavier jo bharat aayaa tha vah 1550 main dharmantaran ke liye japan gaya or usne kai baudhon ko isai banaaya
 In 1643, the Japanese nationalist King Shogun saw the promotion of Christianity as a threat to Japan's social unity
 shogun ne bal kaa prayog kiya or kai charcho ko todaa gaya
 The idols of jesus-mary were seized and broken
 bibal samet isai dharm kii kai kitaaben khuleam jalaayin gayi
 All the Japanese who converted to Christianity were persecuted
 unki balpurvak buddha dharm me ghar vaapasi karai gai
 Those who refused were beheaded
 kai isaiyon ne buddha dharm me ghar vaapasi kaa naatak kiya or krypto-chrishchiyan bane rahe
 In Japan these crypto-christians were called "kakure-christian ***"
 kakure-chrishchiyan ne baudhon ke dar se isai dharm se sambadhit koi bhi kitaab rakhni band kar di
 They prayed to worship Jesus and Mary, which sounded Buddhist mantras, but contained the words of the Bible
 ye isai prarthanaayen kakure-chrischiyanon ne ek peedi se duusari peedi maukhik rup se hastantarit kerani shuru kar di
 From 1550 to the next 400 years, kakure-christian lived under the pseudo-philosophy of Buddhism
 20veen shatabdi main jab japan audyogikeekaran kii taraf badha or baudhon ke dharmik kattarwad main kami ai to in kakure-chrishchiyan buddha dharm ke mukhute se baahar nikal apni isai pahchaan ujagar kii
 The crypto-christian Buddha-like statue, actually of Mother Mary, was venerated by Japan's crypto-christians
 keval roman samrajya or japan main hi krypto chrischiyanon ke udhaaharan nahin milte balki balkans va asia miner, madhyapurv, soviet rashia, china, naji germany samet bharat main bhi krypto chrischiyanon kii bahutayat he
 Just as Japan's crypto is called Christian Kakure, the countries of Asia Minor are called Drovartso in Serbia, Patsloi in Cyprus, Laramanoi in Albania, Crypto Maronite in Lebanon and Crypto Copts in Egypt
 bharat me aise bahut se kakure-chrishchiyan hai jo secularvaad, vampanth or buddha dharm kaa mukhauta pahan kar hamaare bich hai
 The Christian population in India is officially 2 crore and it would not be surprising if 100 million Christians come out of India
 akele punjab main anumaanit isai aabaadi 10 pratishat se upar he
 Many Christians in Punjab are under the cover of Sikhism, wear a turban, wear a beard, saber, a kadha but wear Sikhism but all of them are secret Christians
 bahut se krypto-chrishchiyan aarakshan lene ke liye hindu naam rakhe hai
 Many of these names are on Gods like Ram, Krishna, Shiva, Durga etc
 jinhen sangh ke log bhi sapane main gaiyr-hindu nahin samaj sakate jaise ki purv raashtrapati ke aar narayanan
 Who became a Dalit and rubbed all his life and when he saw the process of burial according to Christianity on his death, it was understood that it is crypto-christian
 desh me aise bahut se krypto-chrishchiyan hai jo hindu naamon main hindu dharm par hamalaa karke sirf vatican kaa agenda badha rahen hai
 We see crypto-christians every day in everyday life but do not understand them because they are hidden in the camouflage of Hindu names
 jaise ki– Naxalites with Hindu names who killed Swami Lakshmanananda are crypto Christians
 jis rajya ne sabase adhik hindi gayak die us rajya bengal main hindi kaa virodh karne vaale krypto chrishchiyan hai
 The earliest example of Gupta Christianity is found in the Roman Empire when Christianity set its feet in Rome in the early days
 tatkaal mahaan romi samraat trojan ne isaiyat ko roman samskruti ke liye khatra samajha or jitne romi isai bane the unke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki yaa to ve isaiyat choden yaa mrityu-dand bhugten
 Roman Christians pretended to leave Christianity to avoid capital punishment
 ve upar se romi devi devataaon kii puja karte rahe, par andar se isaiyat ko maanate the
 In the Hollywood film Agora on this subject, it is shown that when the gupta-christians outnumbered Rome, they started insulting the Roman gods
 sant xavier 1550 main dharmantaran ke liye japan gaya or usne kai baudhon ko isai banaaya
 In 1643, the Japanese nationalist King Shogun saw the promotion of Christianity as a threat to Japan's social unity
 shogun ne bal kaa prayog kiya or kai charcho ko todaa gaya
 The idols of jesus-mary were seized and broken
 bibal samet isai dharm kii kai kitaaben khuleam jalaayee gayi
 All the Japanese who converted to Christianity were persecuted
 unki balpurvak buddha dharm me ghar vaapasi karai gai
 Those who refused were beheaded
 kai isaayiyon ne buddha dharm me ghar vaapasi kaa naatak kiya or krypto-chrishchiyan bane rahe
 In Japan, these secret Christians were called Kakure Christians
 kakure isaayiyon ne baudhon ke dar se isai dharm se sambadhit koi bhi kitaab rakhni band kar di
 They prayed to worship Jesus and Mary, which sounded Buddhist mantras, but contained the words of the Bible
 ye isai prarthanaayen kakure-chrischiyanon ne ek peedi se duusari peedi ko maukhik rup se hastantarit kerani shuru kar di
 They worshiped a Buddha-like idol, which was actually that of Mother Mary
 1550 se le kar agle 400 saalon tak kakure isai buddha dharm ke chhadmaavaran main rahe
 In the 20th century, when Japan moved towards industrialization and Buddhist religious fundamentalism declined, these Kakure Christians came out of the facade of Buddhism to reveal their Christian identity
 balkan or asia miner, madhyapurv, soviet rus, china, naji germany samet bharat main bhi krypto chrischiyanon kii bahutayat he
 The secret Christian countries of Asia Minor are called Drovartso in Serbia, Patsloi in Cyprus, Laramanoi in Albania, Crypto Maronite in Lebanon and Crypto Copts in Egypt
 farsi-arabi lipi yaa sirf farsi lipi arabi lipi par aadhaarit ek lipi he jiskaa prayog farsi, urdu, sindhi, punjabi or anya bhashaaon ko likhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This was mainly because Persian has some sounds that are not in the Arabic language, so some new letters had to be added to the Arabic script to represent them
 arabi bhashaa main 'pa', 'c', 'ga' or 'ji' kii dhvaniyaan nahin milteen jo farsi main maujuud hai
 Pay attention to the pronunciation of 'jh' as it is different from 'jh', 'J' and 'Z'
 inke liye binduon or chote chinhon ke zariye chaar nae akshar jode gaye - پ , چ , گ or ژ 
 Apart from these Persian sounds, urdu-hindi also had some additional sounds that needed to be represented - 't', 'd', 'e'
 inke liye ٹ , ڈ or ڑ aksharon kaa izaad kiya gaya
 In Pashto, there is a sound of 'sh' which is not found in these other languages
 dhyaan dijiye ki pashto main 'sha' kaa uccharan vaisaa hota he jaisaa mul sanskrit main hota tha or yah 'sha' se bhinn he
 For this, 4 letters were added to the script

 malgudi ko praayah dakshin bharat kaa ek kaalpanik kasbaa mana jaataa he

 These kings of Mysore were called 'satakarni'

 The Rajdhani of the Kadambas was in the forest dweller and the Pallavas in Kanchi
 isi bich utar se ikshvaku vansh ke saatven raja durvinith ne pallvon se kuch kshetra chhinakar apane adhikaar main kar liye
 The eighth ruler Sripurush defeated the Pallavas and assumed the title of "paramandi", which also retained the title of the later rulers of the Ganga dynasty
 uttar pashchimi kshetra par paanchavi shatee main chalukyon ne akraman kiya
 In the sixth century, the Chalukya king Pulikashin snatched the atmosphere from the Pallavas and established the capital there

 Many scholars have tried to classify the diverse ways in which the environment is respected
 peter vardi kii pajal of athiks ke anusaar alan marshall or maaikel smith iske haal hi ke do udhaaharan hai
 According to Marshall, three general ethical approaches have emerged in the last 40 years
 marshall unka varnan karne ke liye nimnlikhit shabdon kaa upyog karte he muktivaadee ekstansion, paristhitiki ekstansion or sangrakshan naitikta
 
 marshall ke muktivaadee vistaar main naagarik swatantraaa drushtikon sammilit he 
 paryaavarnavaad main, haalanki, samudaay kaa aashay aam taur par insaan or anya jeev jantu donon se hota he
 Andrew Brennan is in favor of ecological humanism and argues that all moral institutions, unconscious and conscious, can be given purely moral values because they exist
 arni nais or unke sahyogi seshans kaa kaary bhi muktivaadee vistaar ke antargat aata he parantu ve ise "gahan paristhitiki" kahana pasand karte hai
 Peter Singer's work can be classified under Marshall's 'libertarian Extension'
 unhone samajhaayaa ki "naitik mulya kaa vistaarit sarkal" ko phir se banaaya janaa chahie or usame jaanwaron ke adhikaron ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie, or agar aisa nahin kiya jaataa he to aisa na karne vaala naslwad ke doshi honge
 singer ne is tathy ko nahin sweekaara kii achet vastuon kaa bhi aantarik mulya hota he, or apni kitaab"practical athiks" main unhone yah nishkarsh nikaala kii achet vastuon ko naitik mulyon ke vistaarit sarkal main shaamil nahin kiya janaa chahie
 yah drushtikon nishchit rup se jeev kendrit he
 However, in a later version of "practical Ethics", following the work of Naius and Sessions, he has acknowledged that, although he disagrees with the idea of deeper ecology, the intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is argued to be possible but nevertheless questionable
 is
 ham baad main dekhenge ki singer vastav main ek maanavtaavaadi niti kii vakaalat kii he
 Alan Marshall's category of libertarian expansion emphasizes not only human rights but the recognition of basic interdependence of all biological entities and their essential diversity
 jahaan ham muktivaadee vistaar ko prakritik sansar ke raajnneetik pratibimb kaa hissaa maan sakate hai vahiin paristhitik vistaar ko ham prakritik duniya ke ek vaigyanik pratibimb ke rup main maan sakate hai
 Ecological expansion is broadly similar to Smith's eco-holism, and the argument is that they are important for the value inherent in an ecosystem or global environment
 anya vidwaanon kii tarah, homes rolstone, ne bhi is drushtikon ko apanaaya he
 This category also includes the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock according to which the Earth keeps changing its physical structure from time to time to maintain a balance between biological and inorganic materials
 Earth has been considered as a unified, complete institution on which human race will have no importance in the long run
 marshall qi shrenee qi 'sangrakshan naitikta' gaiyr maanav jaivik duniya main upyog mulya kaa ek vistaar he
 It sees the importance of environment in terms of utility for humans
 yah gahan paristhitiki ke aantarik mulya kaa virodh karata he or isliye hi ise 'chhichhlaa paristhitiki' kaha gaya he
 This theory believes that the environment should be protected because it has an external value - which is for the welfare of mankind
 sangrakshan isliye ek lakshya ke liye madhyam bhar he or vishuddh rup se maanav jati or aage aane vaali pidiyon ke hit ke liye he
 It can be said that this was the argument that the governments proposed at the Kyoto Conference in 1997 and on which those three agreements were based which were taken in 1992 in Rio
 baio-centric or eco-holist siddhanto ke antar ko dhyaan main rakhte hue maaikel smith maanavtaavaadi siddhanto ko aise siddhanto ke rup main vargeekrut karte hai jinhen apane naitik str or naitik mahatv ke liye kuch nishcint maapdando par khara utarana aavashyak hota he, jaise kii samvednaa
 yah peter singer ke kaary par bhi lagu hota he jinhone mulyon ke anukram kii baat kii
yah anukram arestu ke kaary se miltaa julata tha jo tark karne kii kshamta par aadhaarit tha
 When we talk about determining the interests of unconscious things like garden grass, this was the solution suggested by Singer for the problem that comes up
 singer ne "vishwa viraasat sthalon" ke sangrakshan kii bhi baat kahi, ye sansar ke ve hisse hai jo abhi tak kharaab nahin hue hai or jo "kam hone ke kaaran bahumoolyawaan" hote jate hai kyunki samay ke saath dhire dhire ve bhi kharaab ho jaayenge
 ye sangrakshit hisse bhavishya main aane vaali peedheeyon ke liye hamaari taraf se vasiyat he, thik us tarah se jis tarah se hame vah apane purvajon se viraasat main mili he
 Now it is up to these generations to decide whether they want to enjoy these clean and unpolluted rural areas or just limit themselves to the urban landscape
 vishwa viraasat sthal kaa ek acha udhaaharan ushnkaribandheey prachur varsha van hai, yah ek bahut hi vishesh paristhitiki tantra yaa jalwaayu charmotkarsh vanaspati kshetra he jiske vikaas main kai shatabdiyon kaa samay laga he
 Cutting of abundant rain forest for cultivation often fails due to soil conditions and once pruned, it takes thousands of years to regenerate
 maanavkendravaad brahmad ke kendra main keval manushyon ko sthaan detaa he, is vichaar ke anusaar, maanav jati ko hameshaa apane vishay main hi sochna chahie
 jab bhi kisi sthiti ke paryaavarniya mulyon ke vishay main sochna hota he tab manushya kii prajati ke vishay main hi sochna pashchimi parampara main prathagat ho gaya he
 Therefore, everything that exists must be evaluated only in the context of the use of mankind, and by doing so we promote racism
 sabhi paryaavaran adhyayanon ko gaiyr manushya jati ke aantarik mulyon kaa akalan karnaa chahie
vastav main, is dharna par aadhaarit, haal hi main, ek darshanik lekh ne manushya ke saharsha rup se anya jeevon ke liye vilupt hone kii sambhaavna kaa pataa lagane kaa praytn kiya he
 The authors have called this idea a meditative experiment and also said that it does not mean that this idea should be acted upon
 maanavkendravaad siddhant is baat kii anumati nahin dete hai ki insaan ke nazariye se taiyaar naitikta galat bhi ho sakati he, yah maananaa aavashyak nahin he ki manushya jati is sansar kii sabase badi sachai he
 The philosopher Baruch Spinoza argues that we wrongly evaluate things in terms of their usefulness to us
 spinoja ne samajhaayaa ki agar ham vastuon ko tatasth bhav se dekhen to ham paayenge ki brahmand main har vastu kaa apana ek anoothaa mulya he
 Likewise, it is possible that a human-centered or anthropocentric / androcentric morality may not be an accurate depiction of reality in reality, and a larger picture is also possible that we are not able to understand from a human point of view
 peter vardi ne do tarah ke maanavkendravaad ke bhed ko pratishthit kiya
 a strong anthropocentric moral thesis argues that humans have been at the center of reality and this is true for them as well
 kamjor maanavkendravaad, haalanki, yah tark detaa he ki vaastaviktaa ko keval maanav kii nazar se hi dekha janaa chahie, manushya jis prakaar se vaastaviktaa ko dekhte hai unhen uske centre main hona hi chahie
 Another viewpoint on this issue is that of Brian Norton, who rendered environmental realism
 yah paryaavarniya yatharthwaad ab is kshetra main ek mukhya vichaardhaara ban gaya he
 Environmental realism refuses to make its stand on the controversy between the advocates of anthropocentrist ethics and non-anthropocentrist ethics
 Instead, Norton prefers to distinguish between strong anthropocentrism and weak or extended anthropocentrism, and he posits the idea that only weak or extended anthropocentrism can undermine man's ability to extract their value from natural objects
 paryaavaran naitikta 1970 main nirantar shaikshik darshanik vichaar kaa ek vishay ban gaya
 It continued to be a part of philosophy in the 1980s, and the subject received little attention from all over the world
 keval 1990 ke baad is tarah ke kaaryakramon ko sansthagat manyata kuch jagahon par mili jaise colorado rajya, montana vishvavidhyalay, bowling green rajya, or uttari texas vishvavidhyalay
 1991 main, dartington ke shoomakar college, england kii sthapana hui, or ab vah samgr vigyaan main emessi pradaan karata he
 These programs started offering masters degree with specialization in philosophy / environment
