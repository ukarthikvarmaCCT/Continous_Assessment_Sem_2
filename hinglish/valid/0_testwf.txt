 The word ‘tatar’ has had different expressions at different times
 kuch logon kaa vichaar he ki pracheen kaal main madhya asia kii tartar naamak nadi ke sambandh se tartar kahe jane lage
 On the contrary, some say that Tatar was actually the name of a prince of Turkish race, whose brother was named Mongol
 is kaaran tartar rajkumaar ke vanshavaale tartar kahe jane lage or mongol rajkumaar ke vanshavaale mongol kehalaae
 New researches have proved both these approaches wrong but no definite facts have been known yet
 ab tak ke kul gyaat saakshyon main sabase pracheen aathvin shatee ke turki bhashaa ke urkhooni lekh hai jinamein "tees tataron" tathaa "nau tataron" kaa ullekh he
 It is also proved from the same articles that at that time this word was not related to Turks directly to Mongols or to any Mongol branch

 Nevertheless, Europeans continued to call them Tatars and the people of Alatun Urdu state and later other rulers of this state were also called Tatars, even though they accepted the religion of Islam in the 14th century AD

 "survival of the fittest" is a phrase commonly used in references other than the one used by its first two proponents: the British erudite philosophers Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin
 sanskrit main isi ko duusare prakaar se yon kaha gaya he- 'daiwo durbalghatakah' Herbert Spencer first used the phrase in his Principles of Biology after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in which he drew parallels between his economic theories and Darwin's biological theories, writing that "this is the healthiest Survival, which i have tried to express here in mechanical terms, is the fact that Mr
 Dr
 Rwyn describes 'natural selection', or the preservation of the biased race of the struggle for life
 " Darwin used Spencer's new phrase "survival of the fittest" as a synonym for "natural selection" in the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species, first published in 1869
 darwin ne iskaa matlab "tatkaal, sthaneey paryaavaran ke liye behatar anukulit" ke liye ek roopak ke rup main, na ki "sarvshereshth shaareerik akruti main" saamaanya anumaan ke rup main nikaala tha

 "yogyata" is baat ko sanderbhit nahin karata he ki koi vyakti "shaareerik drushti se swasth" - bada, tej yaa taqatvar - yaa kisi vyaktiparak gyaan ke anusaar "behatar" he yaa nahin
 yah ek peedi se agali peedi main prajnan dar main antar ko sanderbhit karata he
 
 "keval swasthitam jeevadhariyon kaa hi prabhutv rahegaa" arth main vaakyansh "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" kii vyakhya, vikaas ke vaastavik siddhant ke anuroop nahin he
 Any individual organism that is successful in reproduction is "fit" and will contribute not only to the "physically healthy" living organisms, but also to the survival of its species, although some populations are better adapted to conditions than others Will be adapted from
 a more accurate feature of development would be "survival of sufficiently qualified"
 "paryaapt yogya kii uttarjivita", is tathy se bhi prabhavit he ki jabaki vyaktiyon, jansankhyaon or prajatiyon ke bich pratyaksh pratispardhaa dekhi jaati he, aise bahut kam saboot hai ki pratispardhaa se bade samoohon ke vikaas ko bal mil rahaa he
 For example, between amphibians, reptiles and mammals; However, these animals have evolved into empty ecological habitats
 iske alaava, saral arth "jivit rahane ke liye behatar dhang se susajjit jeevadhariyon kii uttarjivita" vaale vaakyansh kaa galat matlab nikaalane yaa galat dhang se istemaal karnaa bayaanbaji anulaap he
 Darwin was meant to be "better adapted to the immediate, local environment" by differential conservation of organisms that gain better adaptability to living in a changing environment
 yah avadharana koi anulapic avadharana nahin he kyonki isamen fitness kaa ek swatantra maandand shaamil he
 Herbert Spencer first used the phrase in his Principles of Biology after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in which he drew parallels between his economic theories and Darwin's biological theories, writing that "this is the healthiest Survival, which i have tried to express here in mechanical terms, is the fact that Mr
 Dr
 Rwyn describes 'natural selection', or the preservation of the biased race of the struggle for life
 " In the first four editions of On the Origin of Species, Darwin used the phrase "natural selection"
 darwin ne 1868 main prakashit da veriation of animals and plants under domestication ke prishth 6 main likhaa, "jindagi kii ladaai main, sanrachana, gathan, yaa pravriti ke maamle main kisi tarah kaa laabh hasil karne vaale vividhtaon ke is sangrakshan ko maine prakritik chayan naam diya he; or shri harbart spencer ne usee vichaar ko swasthitam kii uttarjivita dwaara kaaphi acchhee tarah se vyakt kiya he
 The term "natural selection" is a somewhat bad word because it indicates conscious choice; But it would be disregarded after a little familiarity "
 Darwin agreed with Alfred Russell Wallace that this new phrase -" survival of the fittest "- survived the sadistic humanization of" selection ", though it did" select nature and fun
 Lost the analogy between "
 In Chapter 4 of the fifth edition of The Origin, published in 1869, Darwin again used the synonym:" natural selection, or survival of the fittest "
 Let's demonstrate
 "swasthitam" shabd se darwin ne "tatkaal, sthaneey paryaavaran ke liye behatar anukulit" matlab, na ki "sarvshereshth shaareerik akruti main" kaa aam aadhunik matlab nikaala
 parichay main unhone puraa shrey spencer ko dete hue likhaa, "maine is siddhant ko manushya kii chayan shakti ke saath iske sambandhi ko chihnit karne ke liye prakritik chayan naam diya he jiske dwaara prayek maamuli badlaav ko, upyogi hone par, sangrakshit he
 But the expression often used by Herbert Spencer is the survival of the fittest is more accurate and sometimes equally convenient
 " In The Man Versus the State, Spencer used the phrase in an epithet to justify a plausible explanation as to why his theories would not be adopted by "militant-type societies"
 He uses the term in the context of warring societies, and by his reference it becomes evident that he is applying a general principle
 "is prakaar, swasthitam kii uttarjivita dwaara ugravadi prakaar kaa samaaj jo bhi ho sabhi maamalon main iske saamne samarpan vaali nishtha ke saath Together, it is characterized by unfathomable trust in the governing power "
 harbart spencer ko saamaajik darvinavaad kii avadharana kaa armbh karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 The phrase "survival of the fittest" has come to be widely used in popular literature as a cushion for a subject corresponding to or related to evolution and natural selection
 is prakaar ise anargal pratiyogita ke siddhanton ke liye lagu kiya jaataa he or iskaa istemaal bade paimaane par saamaajik darvinavaad ke samarthakon or virodhiyon donon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Its flaws have also become more pronounced as a description of Darwinist development
 vikasvaadi jeevigyaani aalochana karte hai jis tarah se is shabd kaa istemaal gaiyr-vaigyanikon dwaara kiya jaataa he or lokapriy samskruti main is shabd ke aasapaas jo sanketarth paidaa hua hai
 This phrase also does not help in conveying the complex nature of natural selection, so modern biologists prefer and especially use the term natural selection
 vastav main, aadhunik jeev vigyaan main, fitness shabd zyaadaatar prajananaatmak safalataa ko sanderbhit karata he or vishisht tareekon ke bare main spasht nahin he jisamen jeevadharee "feet" ho sakate hai jaisaa ki "prarupi visheshtaon main hota he jo astitv or prajnan ko badhaata he" 
 Also, see the blending section of "survival of the fittest" and morality below
 "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" ko kabhi-kabhi daawey ke saath anulaap yaa punarukti kaha jaataa he
 The argument is that if one takes the word "fit" to mean "endowed with phenotypic features that improve survival and chances of reproduction", then "survival of the fittest" is simply "better prepared to survive
" Survival of organisms can be written as "
 iske alaava, yah abhivyakti ek anulaap yaa punarukti ban jaataa he agar koi aadhunik jeev vigyaan main "fitness" kii sarvaadhik vyapak taur par sweekrut paribhaasha kaa istemaal karata he jo keval prajnan sambandhi safalataa he
 This argument is also sometimes used to claim that Darwin's entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological and therefore devoid of any explanatory power
 haalanki, abhivyakti "swasthitam kii uttarjivita", prakritik chayan kii kriyavidhi kaa ek bahut hi adhuraa vivaran pradaan karata he
 The reason is that it does not refer to any main requirement for natural selection, ie the requirement of heredity
 yah sach he ki vaakyansh "swasthitam kii uttarjivita", apane aap main or apane aap, ek anulaap he agar fitness ko uttarjivita or prajnan dwaara paribhaashit kiya jaae
 prakritik chayan, prajnan kii safalataa main vividhta kaa ek hissaa he jo anuvanshik yaa paitruk paatro dwaara hota he 
 If some ancestral characters increase or decrease the survival and reproduction of their office bearers, then the frequency of mechanically following characters who improve survival and reproduction will increase from generation to generation
 This is duly called "evolution by natural selection"
 duusari ore, agar antariya prajananaatmak safalataa kaa netritv karne vaale paatr paitruk nahin hai to koi arthpurna vikaas nahin hoga yaa na hi "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" rahegi: agar prajananaatmak safalataa main hone vaala sudhaar un pravritiyon dwaara ho jo paitruk nahin hai to isaki koi vajah nahin he ki peedi dar peedi in pravritiyon kii aavriti main vruddhi ho
 anya shabdon main, prakritik chayan keval yahi nahin bataata he ki "jivit bachane vaale jivit rahete hai" yaa "prajnan karne vaale prajnan karte hai"; balki, yah bataata he ki "jivit bachane vaale jivit rahete hai, prajnan karte hai or isliye kisi bhi paitruk yaa anuvanshik lakshanon kaa prasar karte hai jinhone unki uttarjivita or prajananaatmak safalataa ko prabhavit kiya he"
 yah kathan yaa bayaan anulapic nahin he: yah pareekshanyogy pariklpana par tikaa hua he ki aisi fitness-prabhavi paitruk badlaav vastav main maujuud he 
 Dr
 Michael Shermer, founder of the Skeptic Society and publisher of Skeptic Magazine, addresses this debate in his 1997 book, Why People Believe Weird Things, in which he explains that although tantrums are sometimes the beginning of science, they sometimes This does not end, and he also states that the angel of scientific principles such as natural selection by moral virtue of his prophetic power Can be Shn can be falsifiable
 shermar ek udhaaharan ke taur par yah bataate hai ki jansankhya anuvanshiki kaa sateek pradarshan tab hota he jab prakritik chayan kisi jansankhya ke parivartan ko prabhavit karegaa yaa nahin karegaa
 shermar anumaan lagaate hai ki agar hominid ke jeevashm bhi trilobites kii tarah ek hi bhuvaigyanik str main paae gaye hote to yah prakritik chayan ke khilaaf saboot hota
 Critics of development assert that "survival of the fittest" provides justification for behavior that ignores moral standards under the guise of strong-grouped standards of justice to the detriment of the weak
 haalanki, naitik maanakon ko sthapit karne ke liye vikasvaadi vivaranon kaa koi bhi istemaal ek prakrutivaadee bhram hoga, kyonki aadeshaatmak naitik bayanon ko vishuddh rup se varnanaatmak parisaron se praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 To describe how things are, does not mean that things should be the same
 It has also been suggested that "survival of the fittest" refers to treating the weak very badly, even in some cases of good social conduct - by cooperating with others and treating them well - Evolutionary competence may improve
 
 haalanki isse he-chahie samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota he
 The claim also states that capitalists of the late 1880s interpreted biology's "survival of the fittest" theory as "an ethical rule that favors cut-throat economic competition", resulting in "social Darwinism "was born which brought glory to an allegedly uninterrupted economy, war and racism
 haalanki ye vichaar pehle ke hai or aam taur par darwin ke vichaaron ke khilaaf hai or vastav main unke samarthakon ne shaayad hi kabhi darwin ko samarthan ke liye taiyaar kiya jis samay aam taur par dharm or horatiyo alger kii puranic kathaon ke auchity kaa daawa kar rahe the
 In the context of capitalist ideology, the term "social Darwinism" was introduced as a term of misogyny by Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought, published in 1944
 darwin ke vikaas ke siddhant kii ek aalochana ke rup main vaakyansh "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" kaa istemaal karnaa parinami nivedan bhram kaa ek udhaaharan he: maanav samaaj main hinsa ke liye ek auchity ke rup main swasthitam kii uttarjivita kii avadharana ke istemaal kaa prakritik jaivik vishwa main 'prakritik chayan dwaara vikaas ke siddhant" par koi prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Russian anarchist Peter Kropostin saw the concept of "survival of the fittest" as an endorsement of cooperation rather than competition
 The analysis he analyzed in his book Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution concluded that the healthiest were not necessarily the best in individual competition, but often from a community made up of people who proved to be the best at working together Were the best in competing
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki In the animal world we have seen that a very large number of species live in society and also that they receive the best support for the struggle of life: understood, of course, in its broader Darwinist sense - not survival Not only as a struggle for means, but also in a struggle against all the natural adversity of the species
 Species of animals, which have been severely limited by personal conflict and have developed the most of the practice of mutual aid, invariably have the largest numbers, are making the most progress, and the most for further progress
 Are more ready
 maanav samaaj ke liye is avadharana ko lagu karke, cropostin ne parsparik sahaayta ko vikaas ke pramukh karkon main se ek rup main prastut kiya, anya kaarak swa-abhikthan he or nishkarsh nikaala ki In the practice of mutual aid, which we can re-picture for the earliest beginnings of development, we thus get the positive and clear origin of our moral perceptions; And we can firmly say that in human moral progress, mutual support, not mutual conflict - is the major part of

 Bhima Nayaka, the son of Seva Lal's father Ramji Nayak, was a very big businessman
 unhen lagbhag bhartiya sabhi bhashaaon kaa gyaan tha
 Their total wealth consisted of 4000 to 5000 cows and bullocks

 He was called Naikada

 There used to be a union of these 52 Bheru and 64 Jogani
 or ye mukhya nayakda ke antargat kaayam karte the
 That is why Saint Seva Lal's grandfather was called Ramshagh Nayak
 bhima nayak bhi 52 taandon ke sanghapramukh the
 Historical documents have shown that Bhima Nayak with the British cost 2 lakh rupees
 Had a merchant agreement
 is baat se saaf pataa chalaata he kii, sevaalaal kaa janm vaibhav sapann ghar main hua tha
 Apart from this, a lot of false stories are heard about his birth
 sevaalaal kii maan kaa naam dharamni tha jo ki jairam badtiya kii suputree thi
 After the marriage of Bhima Nayak, he had no child for almost 12 years, later Saint Sevlal was born after the worship of Mother Mother
 sangh ke paramparik niti ke nusaar swaraksha or anaaj kii raksha ke liye yauddhaon kii nirmiti kii jaati thi
 Keeping the same in mind, Sevlal formed a confederation of 7 Sanghatanaikas in which Sevlal himself, his three brothers, Hapa Badu, Pura and Dharmi, Dhaka, Ramsang were also together
 isi sanghatan ko baad main 6 sangh nayakon ne apanaaya
 In this way a federation of 13 people was formed? Which led to 700 Tando comprising of Madhyabharata, Dakshin Bharat

 According to the state position of the 17th century, we can say that, the influence and power of the British power was increasing day by day and the system of Indian kings was getting weaker
 angreji hukumat kaa gore banjaaraa vyapaaree par raajaaon ko rasad pahunchane ke khilaaf dabaav badhate ja rahaa tha
 And the British tax-affected Gor Banjara merchants were being charged with tax collection which was against the merchant rules of Gor Banjara
 is kar vasuli ke khilaaf prastaav lekar sevaalaal apane sabhi sangh nayakon ke saath nizaam se milane gayi
 Fearing the British rule, the Nizam turned down the proposal, in view of this Sevlal declared war against the Nizam
 phir hyderabad main yuddh hua or parinamswarup nizaam ne sevaalaal kii sabhi sharte manjur kii or bharat ke anya rajyon ke karpranali ke liye dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ko milane kii salaah di
 Sevlal accepted the Nizam's advice and accepted the honor given by the Nizam
 sammaan ke taur par nizaam ne tamrapatr, talwaar or bhetwastu di
 These Bhetavastuans still exist in the Pohragadh temple
 dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ne is prastaav ko naamanjur kiya, parinaam swarup sevaalaal ne yuddh kaa elaan kiya, gulam khan ke 25000 sainikon kaa muqabla sevaalaal ke 900 yauddhaon ne kiya
 Historians never mentioned this war, Ghulam Khan lost heavily
 gulam khan ne karpranali ko maaf karne ko manjur kiya
 This was a huge political victory for Sevlal from a business point of view
 is jeet ke chalate sevaalaal kaa naam puure bharat varsh main prasiddh hua
 Gaurbanjara of Lahore honored Sevlal
 jaipur ke banjaaraa vyapaaree or bahujan logon kii pukaar par sevaalaal ne bhumia naamak dahshatagrast kaa shirched kiya or rajasthanvaasiyon ko bhumia se mukti dilaai
 Even today, this is a sign of Sevlal's Mandir at Sawai Mansing Hospital in Jaipur
 dilhisthit rysina hill lakishon banjaaraa ne sevaalaal ke swaagat main banaai hui chhatri nehru planitorium, nai dilli main maujuud he
 Similarly, there is still Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in Sevanamak village near Mumbai, where Sevalal Port used to be in the 17th century
 vaise hi dharmtar naam kaa port raigarh jilhe main pen ke paas maujud he
 Similarly, not even Bhaucha in Mumbai is Sevabhaya's push
 is jagah par portuguese kaa jahaaj fas gaya tha use sevaalaal ne nikaala, falswarup unhen motiyon kii maala diya gaya, isi vajah se sevaalaal motivalo ke naam se bhi jane jate hai
 Sevlal had a merchant center in the village named Gagode near Paan in Rayagada district where the Mandir of his name still exists
 sevaalaal bahut bade vyapaaree, yauddha, sangatak, arthtajna to the hi lekin uske saath ve bahut bade samajasudharak the
 The strength and wisdom of Sevlal can be ascertained from the fact that the prophecies that Sevlal had about the social and economic and natural state of India are coming true after 250 years

 iskaa aadhikarik upyog 1 caitra, 1879 shak yug, yaa 22 march 1957 main shuru kiya tha
 However, government officials seem to prefer the New Year of religious calendars over the new year of this calendar
 
 The Reform Committee also formalized a religious calendar called the Rashtriya Almanac
 yah, anya kai kshetreey chandra-saura panchang par aadhaarit panchangon kii tarah 10 veen shatabdi ke surya siddhant par aadhaarit tha
 The word panchang is derived from the Sanskrit panchangam, which signifies the five parts of the almanac: lunar day, lunar month, half day, angles of the sun and moon, and solar day
