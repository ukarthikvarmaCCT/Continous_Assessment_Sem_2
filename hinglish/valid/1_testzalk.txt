 ipos can be a risky investment
 For individual investors, it is difficult to predict how the shares will perform in their early day trading and in the near future as they do not have enough data to analyze the company as well as most ipos
 Those companies are going through a temporary development, so there is uncertainty in terms of their future value

 In a multinational IPO, the issuer's company may have up to three organizations of underwriters to deal with different legal requirements to suit other markets
 For example, an EU issuing company is represented in its domestic market, Europe, The principal underwriting organization may

 Most ipos can be found on the Nasdaq stock market, which lists computer and information technology related companies
 But, relatively new and untested firms are large
 Despite the availability of large amount of financial resources, a large number of firms started falling into cash crisis
 The crisis was particularly in cases where the founding party had sold an important portion of its stake immediately after the atav issue of the IPO
 yah ghatana thi sanyukt rajya tak simit nahin thi
 In Japan, for example, a similar situation was presented
 kuch companiyon is tarah ho rahaa tha jaise ipo jari karnaa hi unka ekmaatr lakshya ho kuch share bazaar aisi hi companiyon ke liye sthapit kiye gaye the, jaise kii nasdac japan 
 Perhaps the most obvious bubbles in the history of the hot IPO market were in 1929 and 1989, when ipos of limited-term funds were sold at extremely large premiums
 If we compare the market value of limited-term funds to the value of the shares included in the fund
 Bubbles are seen when the market price is in multiples of the underlying value

 People's perception about the IPO may be controversial
 The IPO was a complete failure for the people who got it as much capital as possible
 It was important to note that there are different types of investors in an auction and in the open market - the auction was believed to be a complete success for those who were measuring the IPO by the benefits of devaluation to investors
 Institutions bid in and individual investors in the open market Google may be a special case but because many individual investors have recently issued ipo's for stock Mbi term buy to keep in mind ke value, aitihaasik taur par dekhen to america or vaishvik donon hi staron par ipo avamoolyit rahe hai ipo kaa praarambhik avamulyan, stock ke pehali baar kaarobaar main aate samay usame atirikt ruchi paidaa karne kaa kaam karata he yah un niveshkon ke liye ullekhneey laabh kaa strot ho saktaa he jinhen 'maangi keemat' par share mili hon haalanki, ipo kaa avamulyan karne par company ko us poonji ko tyaagna hota he jise vah stock ko unche mulya par vikray kar praapt kar sakati thi The risk of overvaluation is also an important consideration

 kyonki vah behatar hota he, arun ko phaansi kii sajaa sunai jaati he

 arun phir pratishodh mishan par jaataa he or mamaa thakur ke lagbhag har godaam ko jalataa he, jo kamishnar ko pareshaan karata he kyonki vah arun ko aatmasamarpan karne ke liye raji nahin kar pate
 Arun then grabs Mama Thakur from the police security van and beats him badly
 vikram ne sapana ko shankar bihari se bachaaya or us jagah par pahunche
 Then all the goons are killed
 arun kaa badla mamaa thakur ke mrityu or sapana ke uske saath phir se aane se puraa ho gaya
 As Advocate Sinha becomes a witness, Arun's truth comes to the fore
 lekin kyonki usne mamaa thakur ko maar daalaa, use jail janaa padataa he
 Due to the physical and mental stress Arun has endured, he is given a short sentence in jail
 vikram arun or sapana ko apni gaadi main dur le jaataa he, saath hi gupt rup se apane chehre par ek bahadur muskaan daalata he kyonki vah sapana se pyaar karata tha

 The periodic table is a system of representing chemical elements as a table with their corresponding characteristics
 aavart sarini main rasinic tatva parmaanu kramank ke badhate kram main sajaaye gayi hai tathaa aavart, praathmik samooh, dwitiyak samooh main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 The current periodic table contains 118 known elements
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 a few months later, German scientist Lothar Meyer also independently created the periodic table
 mendeleyev kii sarini se alfred varnor ne aavart sarini kaa vartmaan swaroop nirmit kiya
 In 1952, Costa Rica scientist Gil Chaveri introduced a new form of the periodic table that was based on the electronic structure of elements
 rasayan shastriyon ke liye aavart sarini atyant mahatvapurn evam upyogi he
 Because of this, memorizing only the properties of lesser elements works because the properties in a group or a period in the periodic table change in a certain order and in a rational way
 neeche aavart sarini kaa aadhunik rup dikhaaya gaya he jisamen 18 varg tathaa 7 aavart hai- Lanthanide and actinide have been kept separate from other metals in this prevailing arrangement of the periodic table
 vistrut or ati-vistrut aavart saranion main f-block or g-block dhaatuon ko bhi ek saath prabandhit kiya jaataa he
 Categories of elements in the periodic table tatwon ke parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhi kram main krambaddh karne par kshaitij kataren praapt hoti hai jinhen 'aavart' kehete hai
 According to the periodic law, when the elements are decorated in horizontal lines in increasing order of atomic weight, the elements having salmon properties are present in the same vertical column, these are called 'squares'
 aavart sarini ke urdhv kataron ko 'samooh' yaa 'varg' kaha jaataa he
 Groups are considered to be the most important in terms of classification of elements
 kuch samoohon main, tatv samaan gun darshaate hai
 The names of these groups are alkaline elements, alkaline earth metals, halogen, nictogen, chalcogen and inert gas
 aavart sarini ke kshaitij kataron ko aavart kehete hai
 Although groups are considered to be more important in the classification of elements, then there are many sites in the periodic table where the importance of periodic is greater
 udhaaharan ke rup main di-block yaa sankraman dhaatuon or epa-block ko liya ja saktaa he
 Modern periodic table is also called long form of periodic table
 isamen 18 varg tathaa 7 aavart hai
 Atoms of all elements of a single class have the same number of electrons in the outermost orbit
 is kaaran kisi ek varg ke sabhi tatwon ke mukhya gun samaan hote hai
 On the basis of valence electrons, the elements are divided into 4 sections - s, p, d, f
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 according to this, arthath yadi tatwon ko parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhikram main rakhaa jaay to wo tatv jinke gun samaan hote hai ek nishchit avadhi ke baad aate hai
 Mendeleev tried to demonstrate the aspect of recurring physical and chemical properties of elements with the help of this table
 mandelif kii aavart sarini main kul 8 varg the kyonki us samay niskriy gaison kii khoj nahin hui thi
 Later the 9th class was included in the modern periodic table after the discovery of inert gases
 is 9wein varg ko 0 kehete hai
 Classes one through eighth are represented by the Roman letters I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII
 nawein varg ko 0 dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 In the last phase of its development, scientists like Raga, Werner, Bohr and Bari created the modern form of the periodic table which is in practice till the present
 inhone mendelive kii aavart sarini main upasthit shreniyon ko khatm kiya tathaa virgo kii sankhya ko 9 se badhaakar 18 kiya
 Even after this, the two main drawbacks so far are the presence of hydrogen in two places and the absence of lanthanide and actinide elements in the table
 madlif dwaara aavart sarini prastut karne ke kuch maheenon baad german vaigyanik lother meyar ne bhi swatantra rup se aavart sarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 From 1815 to 1913, it underwent a lot of reforms so that the newly invented elements could be given proper place and the table should be in accordance with the new information

 Lucas has also made a conscious effort to parallel scenes from the films and especially Luke Skywalker's travels, and also to keep the narrative parallel to his father Anakin's while they were adding back-to-back episodes

 In 1971, Universal Studios agreed to make the films American Graffiti and Star Wars under a two-film contract, although Star Wars was later rejected for its initial stage concept

 Frustrated that his story is so difficult to explain, Lucas wrote a 13-page short article titled Star Wars, a light-hearted remake of Akira Kurokha's The Hidden Fortress
 san 1974 aate-aate unhone chote se lekh ko patakatha main masaude ko mote praaroop main viksit kiya, jisamen kai nae tatv jaise ki sith, da deth star evam ek noujvaan ladke ko enikin starkiller ke naam se agua ke rup main pesh kiya gaya
 For the second draft, Lucas made a number of simplifications and also introduced the boy as Luke
 anakin ek budhimaan jedy nite ke rup main ljuk kaa pita bana
 Force was also introduced as a supernatural force
 agle masaude ke praaroop main pita ke kirdaar ko hataakar vikalp ke rup main ben kenobi ke naam se rakh diya gaya or san 1976 main pradhan photography ke liye chauthaa masauda taiyaar kiya gaya
 The film was named Adventures of Luke Star Killer, taken from the Journal of Wheels, Saga i The Star Wars
 nirmaan ke dauraan, lucas ne luk kaa naam skywanker kar diya or film ko sheershak ko sirf da star wars or ant main keval star wars kar diya
 At this stage, Lucas did not expect that the film would become part of a series
 The fourth draft of the script underwent some subtle changes, making it an even more satisfying film in its own right, ending with the demolition of the entire empire through the demise of the Death Star
 haalanki, lucas ne film ke bare main dussahasik karnaamon kii ek series ke rup main hi kalpana kii thi 
 baad main, usne yah mahasoos kiya ki vastav main anukram kii yah pehali film nahin hogi, balki aakhyaan main dwitiya trayee hogi
 It is discussed in detail in George Lucas' preface on the 1994 republishing of Splinter of the Mind's Eye
 maine star wars likhnaa shuru kiya hi tha ki jald hi mainen mahasoos kiya ki is kahani ko ek hi film main pirona naammumkin he
 As the saga of the brave like Saga and Jedi came to the fore, i saw that it would require at least nine films to fully narrate the saga — three trilogies — and i also realized that while making way from the previous story To reach the latter i started the setting from the middle of the story
 duusare masaude main "ondos kii rajkumaari" ke bare main uttar bhaag na ban sakane vaali ek jatil samasya thim; or jabatak teesraa masauda taiyaar hota uske kuch maheenon ke baad lucas ne ek anubandh par samjhauta kar liya jiske antargat do uttar bhaagon kii kadiyon ko taiyaar karne kaa adhikaar praapt ho gaya
 Soon Lucas met with writer Elaine Dean Foster, he tied up with him to write novels on the remaining two episodes of the North
 aisa iraadaa tha ki agar star wars safal hui to lucas un upanyaason ke aadhaar par patakatha likh sakegaa
 By then, he too had developed a fairly wide-spread backstory to aid his writing process
 jab star wars safal sabit ho gaya, lucas ne film kaa upyog lambey serial ke nirmaan ke liye karne kaa nishchay kiya, haalanki ek mode par usne puri tarah shrunkhlaa se prasthaan kar lene kaa faisla kar liya tha
 However, Lucas wanted to create an independent film production center — which could have been Sky Walker Ranch — and he had the chance to use the series as an agent to finance
 alan dean foster upanyaas kii pehali likhnaa aarambh kar chuke the, lekin lucas ne foster ke lekhan kaary ko apnaane kii yojana tyaag dene kaa faisla kiya; agle varsh splinter of da minds aai ke naam se pustak prakashit hui
 Initially, Lucas first envisioned series of films without the number of fixed series, just like the James Bond series
 agast 1977 main roling stone ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main, unhone kaha ki ve chaahate the ki unke har ek mitra baari-baari se filmon kaa nirdesan karen or series ko ek abhinav arthvatta pradaan karen
 He also said that the backstory of the story where Darth Vader turns on the bad side, kills Luke's father and is in a clash with Ben Kenawi on a volcano, and in the meantime the Gangetic Republic collapses All of these together will form an excellent answer story
 tatpashchaat usee varsh, lucas ne vigyaan katha lekhak ley bracket ko star wars II likhane ke liye apane saath anubandhit kiya
 By the end of November 1977 he held a story conference, in which Lucas presented a handwritten brief called The Empire Strikes Back
 yah rachana film ke antimrup ke kaaphi anuroop thi keval us ghatana ko chhodkar jab daarth vadeyr yah khulaasa nahin karata he ki vah luk kaa pita he
 In the first draft from where Brackett will begin writing, Luke's father appears to instruct Luke
 bracket ne 1978 ke aarambh main hi apana pehla praaroop taiyaar kar liya; lucas ne kaha ki isse ve niraash hue hai, lekin isse pehle ki ve iske bare main uske saath vichaar-vimarsh karte, vah cancer se mar gayi
 With no writer available, Lucas had to write another format himself
 It was in this format that Lucas first used the term "episode" to refer to the number of series of films that had Empire Strikes Back Episode II on its list
 jaisaa ki maaikel kaminsaki ne da sikret history of star wars ke bare main tark pesh karte hue, pehle praaroop par apni niraashaa prakat kii he shaayad isi kaaran lucas ko kahani ko duusari disha main mode dene par vichaar karnaa padaa
 unhone kathanak ko ek nayaa mode diya: daarth vadeyr ljuk ke pita hone kaa daawa karata hai
 According to Lucas, he enjoyed writing this format, as it was in stark contrast to the writing of the years' struggle for the first film, and he soon wrote two more by April 1978
 unhone patakatha ko andhere kii antim seemaa tak pahunchaa diya jab ve hain solo karbonite ke kaid kar kudakhana jaise karagaar main chhod dete he
 This new stage of the story, in which Darth Vader revels as Luke's father, exerts a strong influence on the series
 maaikel caminsaki ne apni pustak main yah daleel di he ki aisa nahin lagata ki shaayad hi 1978 se pehle kathanak ke is bindu par itani gambhirtha se vichaar kiya gaya ho athwa isaki kaalpanik avdhaaran bhi kii gai ho or isiilie pehali film ek vaikalpik kahani kii kadi ke tahat parichaalit ho rahi thi jahaan vadeyr ljuk ke pita se alag ho jaataa he, kathanak ke is vindu ke bare main 1978 se pehle koi bhi sandarbh uplabdh nahin he
 After writing the second and third formats of Empire Strikes Back that included this point, Lucas re-reviewed the new episode of the previous story that he composed; Anakin was a meritorious student of skywalker Ben Kenobi; He had a child named Luke but under the influence of Emperor Palpatine, he turned to the dark side
 Anakin battled with Ben Kenobi in the volcano and was also wounded, but was then revived as Darth Vader
 is bich jab tak ganraajya samrajya ban jaataa or vadeyr jedy shoorveeron ko khoj nikaalata kenobi ne ljuk ko tatuin naamak ek kaalpanik grih par chipa diya
 In place of this new episode of the previous story, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy, in which Empire Strikes Back would be transformed into Episode II in Episode II, the next format
 Lawrence Kasdan, who had just finished writing Raiders of the Lost Ark, was contracted to write the next format and also received additional support from director Irvine Karschner
 kasdan, karshanar or nirmaataa gairi kartz ko laga ki yah film behad gambhir or vyasak film ban gai he, jise nai gahari kaali kahani kii ruparekha se madad mili he or series ko pehali kahani kii halki-phulki sussahsik mul kathaon se viksit kii gai he
 When he started writing Episode VI in 1981, much had changed
 empire strix back kaa nirmaan kaaphi tanaavpurn or mahangaa tha, evam lucas kii apni nijee jindagi bhi bikhar rahi thi
 In an interview with Time magazine in May 1983, he vowed that he had nothing to do with the series anymore, feeling much more exhausted and no longer wanting to make any further Star Wars films
 lucas ke 1981 ke praathmik praaroop main daarth vadeyr ko luk par apane adhikaar ke liye pratidwandvita karata hua dikhaaya gaya tha - or duusare patakatha main, "sanshodhit praathmik praaroop" main, vadeyr ek sahanubhutisheel charitra ban gaya
 Lawrence Kasdan was once again assigned the responsibility and in these final formats, Vader's mask was removed
 charitra main yah badlaav "tragedy of daarth vadeyr" kii kahani kii kadi main ekaek oochaal pradaan karegaa jo purv bhaagon main antanirhit he
 After losing a long time of good luck in a divorce settlement in 1987, Lucas had no desire to return to Star Wars again and unofficially followed the sequel to The Return of the Jedi
 Canceled
 haalanki purvabhag jo kaaphi kuch viksit ho chukaa tha, unke man ko lubhaata rahaa
 After Star Wars once again became popular with the dark horse stream of humor and the trilogy of novels by Timothy Zahn, Lucas noticed that it still had a large audience
 unke bachche ab dhire-dhire bade hone lage the or CGI takanic ke dhamaake ke baad ve ab lautne or nirdesan dene ke bare main vichaar karne lage the
 By 1993, it was announced, with Variety citing other sources, that they would build the precinct
 unhone kahani kii ruparekha taiyaar kerani shuru kar di, ab is baat ke sanket milane lage ki anakin skywanker ke buraai kii ore kaayantaran kii pariksha se guzarane ke kaaran series traasad hogi
 Lucas also began to make some changes to some of the story so that the prequel's relative relationship with the original would be maintained
 pehle-pehle pichhali kahani ke purvabhag kii in kadiyon ko itihaas kii "khaali jagah ko bharne" ke rup main mana ja rahaa tha, taaki samanaantar athwa sparsharekhiy astitv bana rahe, kintu ab unhone dekha ki ve ab ek nai lambi kahani kii shuruyaat kar denge jo anakin ke bachapan se aarambh hogi or mrityu main jaakar samaapt hogi
 This was the final step towards converting the film's series into a "narrative"
 1994 main, lucas ne episod I: da bigining ke sheershak se pehali patakatha likhni shuru kii
 Along with the release of the film, Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two and he started working on Episode II at the same time
 episod II kaa pehla praaroop pradhan photography se thik kai saptaah purv hi sampoorn ho gaya tha or lucas ne da yang indiana jones chronicals se ek lekhak jonathan helles ko praaroop ko parimarjeet karne ke liye anubandhit kar liya
 In a state of uncertainty about the title of the film, Lucas jokingly called the film "jar Jars Great Adventures"
 likhit rup se da empire strix back, lucas ne aarambhik taur par yah nishchay kiya tha ki lando kalrisian ek krintak tha or chlons vaale grah se aayaa tha jiske kaaran "clon wars" hue the jiskaa ullekh kenobi ke dwaara a new hope main kiya gaya he; baad main unhone clon kii puri sena-vahini kii vaikalpik avadharana prastut kii jo grah se aae the jisane ganraajya par hamalaa kar diya or jedy ran bankuron ke dwaara peeche khaded di gaye
 These basic elements of the previous narrative became the cornerstone of the Episode II plot, adding additional new secret information that the entire event was Palpatine's personal running plan
 yahaan tak ki atake of da chlons ke release se pehle hi lucas ne episod III ko lekar kaam karnaa shuru kar diya saath hi pariklpana ke kalakaaron ko vishesh soochna dete hue ki film kii shuruyaat saat clon yuddh ke film sangrathan se hogi
 As he reviewed the story's outline that summer, though he says he has made a radical change in the plot
 da sikret history of star wars main maaikel kaminsaki, pramaan prastut karte hai ki anakin ke andhere paksh main patan ke muddon ne lucas ko kahani main amul parivartan ke liye baadhya kar diya, pehla to udghaatan vaala drishy jisamen palpatin kaa apharan karnaa or duku ko anakin ke dwaara maar diya janaa baad vaale ke andhere paksh kii ore mud jane main pehla drishy tha
 After the main cinematography was completed in 2003, Lucas made many major changes to Anakin's character by rewriting his turn to the completely dark world; Now he will first turn to the quest to save Padmi from death, not as in the previous version, which included one of several reasons that he actually believed that the Jedi were evil and conspired to capture the republic
 Was planning is moulik punarlekhan kaa kaary sampadan or pramukh footage donon ke jariye sampann hua or ab naye sanshodhit drishyon ko san 2004 ke teji se filmakan ke dauraan filmaaya gaya
 Whatever facts Lucas presented for the series was often exaggerated; Much of which resulted from the post-1978 period when the series turned into a significant event
 maaikel kaminsaki ne savistaar samajhaayaa ki ye atishyoktiyaan prachaar or suraksha donon ke hi liye upaay hai
 Giving a logical explanation, Kaminski said that since the series has changed completely over the years
 isliye lucas kaa abhipraay mul kahani ko purvaprabhavi tareeke se parivartit karnaa rahaa kyonki darshak tathy ko keval apane hi najariye se dekhenge
 At a 2005 showwest conference, Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he planned to air six films in the new 3-D format; Which started in 2007 with a New Hope
 haalanki janvari san 2007 ke aasapaas, lucasfilm ne starwars
com main kaha ki "starwors gaatha ko 3-D main prasaarit karne kii koi nishchit yojana or tithi nahin he"
 europe main july san 2007 ke ek utsav samaaroh main, rik macelem ne yah pushti kii ki lucasfilm "sabhi chah filmon ko lekar 3-D main badal dene kii yojana he", lekin ve "un companiyon ke saamne aane kaa intjaar kar rahen hai jo aisi takanic viksit kar rahe hai taaki laagat ke str ko kam kar saken jisase ki har kisi ke liye yah sarthak ho saken
july n 2008 main jeffri katjemberg, dreamworks anemation ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ne yah khulaasa kiya ki jorge lucas sabhi chah filmon ko punah 3-D main bana rahe hai
 Lucas has indicated in the past that he will air the decisive versions of six Star Wars films in the future on the next-generation home-video format
 There have been discussions that we will use this opportunity to make any kind of final adjustments, changes, additions and / or any kind of subtraction in the film before the final broadcast
 The altered clip of The Phantom Men accommodated a feature of the DVD release of Revenge of the Sith that featured a computerized Yoda removing the original puppet; Animation director Rob Coleman said that Kilp was created just before the program of Revenge of the Sith, to mark Yoda's trial
 lucasfilm ke vipanan upaadhyaksh gym ward ne yah ghoshnaa kii ki lucasfilm filmon par or bhi adhik kaam karnaa chahta he, saath main yah bhi kaha ki "jyon-jyon takneekee tarakkee hoti he or ham ucch-stareey parimarjeet manch pate hai jiskaa graahak aasaani se upbhog kar saken, paristhiti or bhi adhik behatar hogi, lekin phir bhi bahut kuch karne ko baaki rah jaayegaa

 Wittgenstein's writings have resulted in considerable argumentation, even many times Wittgenstein's work has been called a paradox, but it would be wrong to say that logicians had emphasized logical analysis of language even before Wittgenstein

 Wittgenstein's conclusion proved to be new and important to the philosophical world
 vitgenstin ne ek prakaar se is vichaar kaa pratipaadan kiya ki bhashaa se satya kaa vivaran nahin balki satya kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he

 Just this evening, here, by decorating Suyodhan's jai-tilak, we will return, Dundubhi of course Jai, by playing the middle of the battle
 itane main kutil niyati-prerit pads gaye saamne dharmraj, tutaa kruthant-sa karn, coke par padey tut jis tarah baj 
lekin, donon kaa visham yudhd, kshan bhar bhi nahin thahar paaya, sah saki na gahari chot, yudhishthar kii muni-kalp, mridul kaaya 
 They run away from Ran, Karna hurriedly went to the grove, said to the Kautuk, Maharaj! You turned out to be a gentle ativ
 Yes, i am not gentle, i would save my life by saying gentle
 For the sake of the future, let me also give a simple idea
 hai wipro aap, seviye dharm, taru-tale kahin, nirjan van main, kya kaam saadhuon kaa, kahiye, is mahaghor, ghaatak ran main ?mat kabhi kshatrata ke dhokhe, ran kaa pradaah jhela kariye,jaaiye, nahin phir kabhi garuda qi jhapaton se khelaa kariye 
 Dharmaraj, who is in despair, escaped from the summer, thinking, "will you know what is in your mind, this society of knights? Why didn't we give up our lives to live after being deprived? The sinner donated life only to bear the commotion
" samajhe na hai, kaunteya ! karn ne chod diye, kisalie praan, gardan par aakar laut gayi sahasaa, kyon vijayi kii kripaan ?lekin, adrishy ne likhaa, karn ne vachan dharm kaa paal kiya,khadg kaa chin kar grass, use maa ke anchal main daal diya 
 How pure is this modesty! As long as Karna remained in the standing battle, the idol of Chetnamayi's mother kept wandering in the mind
 By bringing Sahedev, Yudhishthra, Nakula, Bhima repeatedly in the bus, he laughed free and found something from within
 dekhtaa rahaa sab shlay, kintu, jab isi tarah bhaage pavithan, bolaa hokar vah chakit, karn kii ore dekh, yah parush vachan, re sutaputra ! kisalie vikat yah kalprishth dhanu dharta he ?maarna nahin he to phir kyon, veeron ko gher pakadta he ? Sangram Vijay, what will you do like this till evening? Will you beat the Arians that life will die on their own? This strange game of Rann, i don't understand anything, coward! Surely remember Partha, you are afraid of your mind
 hanskar bolaa radhey, shalya, parth kii bheeti usko hogi, kshayman, kshanik, bhangur sharir par mrisha priti jisko hogi 
is chaar dinon ke jivan ko, main to kuch nahin samajhataa hum, karata hum vahi, sadaa jisko bheetar se sahi samajhataa hum 
 But it has taken a lot of breath away from the mouth of these arrows, and i give a happy laugh, from which difference of happiness, it is not the story of the inner body, it is to be told out of the mouth, this anguish is like a groom of religion, happiness
 - Including silence
 sab aankh moond kar ladte hai, jai isi lok main paane ko, par, karn jujhataa he koi, ooncha sadhdarm nibhaane ko, sabake samet panical sar main, mere bhi charan padente kya ?ye lobh mrittikamay jag ke, aatma kaa tej harenge kya ?

The plane has to be carried in the sky above the soil
 Some gathering material to make a ladder in the surface, i threw these four full, to decorate the top
 ye chaar phul hai mol kinhin kaatar nayanon ke pani ke, ye chaar phul prachhann daan hai kisi mahabal dani ke 
ye chaar phul, meraa adrusht tha hua kabhi jinka kaami,ye chaar phul paakar prasann hansate honge antaryami 
 You will not understand this surgery, this feat is of the fools, these games are about the crazy people with a lot of purpose in winning
 Those who drink the taste of this dream, live in the world and live apart from the world
 samajha na, satya hi, shalya ise, bolaa pralaap yah band karo, himmat ho to lo karo samar, bal ho, to apana dhanush dharo 
lo, vah dekho, vaanari dhwaja dur se dikhaayi padati he, parth ke maharath kii gharghar aawaaj sunaayi padati he
 Is Ashwana hot! Seeing the power is ashamed, the army is retrenching, the rear is captured
 radhey ! kaal yah pahanch gaya, shaayak sandhanit turna karo, the vikal sadaa jiske hit, vah laalasaa samar kii purna karo 
 On seeing Parth, there was a shallow - umang - complemented ur - parvar, after getting dumbfounded, Karna woke up to a huge cloud
 Both of us were created, for which both of us got to know the nature of nature
 jis din ke liye kiye aaye, ham donon vir athak saadhan, aa gaya bhagya se aaj janm-janmon kaa nirdhaarit vah kshan 
aao, ham donon vishikh-vahni-poojit ho jaijyakaar karen, mamchhedan se ek duusare kaa ji-bhar satkar karen 
 But, be careful, do not have to be separated from this meeting point, either one of us will have to sleep here today
 Very large, today the decision has to be finalized, that of the enemy or that your head is cut, put it here is
 karn kaa dekh yah darp parth kaa, dahak uthaa ravikant-hriday, bolaa, re sarathi-putr ! kiya tu ne, satya hi yogya nishchay 
par koun rahegaa yahaan ? baat yah abhi bataaye detaa hum, dhad par se tera sis mooth ! le, abhi hathaaye detaa hum 
 Saying this, Arjuna made a bow-and-arrow bracelet till his ears, he guessed the opposition to his known opposition
 par, karn jhel vah maha vishiksh, kar uthaa kaal-sa attahas, ran ke saare swar dub gayi, chaa gaya ninad se dishakash 
 Vola, Bravo, Veer Arjun! It was very deep hospitality; But, do not feel bad, if you come on it, it was useless on me
 Without the armor and the coil, consider this body to be a soft lotus, consider the cult-lit chest, still immovable
 ab lo meraa uphaar, yahi yamalok tumhen pahunchaayegaa, jivan kaa sara swaad tumhen bas, isi baar mil jaayegaa 
kah is prakaar radhey adhar ko dabaa, raudrata main bharke, hurkaar uthaa ghaatika shakti vikaraal sharasana par dharke 
 As long as God, dance, there is little silence here and there, till the chariot itself, it fell apart, the lawless, the wretched, the seer
 Happened ? par nahin, maran kaa tat chhukar, ho uthaa achir arjuna prabudhd ;krodhandh garaj kar laga karn ke saath machaane dwirath-yudhd 
pravritt-se garaj-garaj donon, karte the pratibhat par prahaar, thi tula-madhya santulit khadi, lekin donon kii jeet haar 
 On this side, like Karna Muttmand-like, the part on that side, like the end of the battle, as if the miss of the battle, as if the self-destruct, got up in summer
 Terrible war he katha, nayan kaa lobh nahin, sanvruth kar sake swayan surgan, bhar gaya vimaanon se til-til, kurubhu par kalakal-nadit-gagan 
thi rukii disha kii saans, prakruti ke nikhil rup tanmay-gabhir, upar stambhit dinmani kaa rath, neeche nadiyon kaa achal nir 
 Rashmirathi / VII Canto / Part 3from Hindi literaturejump to: navigation, search Author: Ramdhari Singh "dinkar" ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ In the meantime Karna of the city saw one who woke up from his eyes and tarkas, some fierce poisoning, said that Karna! i am the lord of Ashwaseen Vishrut Bhujango, the ultimate enemy of birth, i am your benevolent benefactor
 bas, ek baar kar krupa dhanush par chadh sharavy tak jane de, is mahashathru ko abhi turat syandan main mujhe sulaane de 
kar vaman garal jivan bhar kaa sanchit pratishodh utaaruunga, tu mujhe sahaara de, batchqar main abhi parth ko maaroonga 
 Radhey laughed and said, o devious! What does it say? All the means of Jai are in the arms of the male
 us par bhi sanpon se mil kar main manuj, manuj se yudhd karun ?jivan bhar jo nishtha paali, usase aacharan virudhd karun ? Jai with your help, i will be able to spontaneously, to come to mankind, but, what will i show? he ashwasen ! tere anek vanshaj hai chhipe naron main bhi, simit van main hi nahin, bahut basate poor-gram-gharon main bhi 
ye nar-bhujang maanavtaa kaa path kathin bahut kar dete hai, pratibal ke vadh ke liye neech saahayya sarp kaa lete hai 
 It is not that my bright name is also raised in these snakes
 After growing my ideal and some sin of maleness increase
 Arjun is my enemy, but he is not a snake, it is male, struggle is not eternal, enmity is there throughout this life
 
 aglaa jivan kisalie bhala, tab ho dweshandh bigaadan main ?sampo kii jaakar sharan, sarp ban kyon manushya ko maarun main ?ja bhaag, manuj kaa sahaj shatru, mitrataa na meri paa saktaa, main kisi hetu bhi yah kalshak apane par nahin laga saktaa 
 Karna departed after doing Kakodar, then roared in the summer, Amber raised the everlasting shriek, the plane of the desolate was shaken
 pandav-sena bhaybheet bhaagti hui jidhar bhi jaati thi ;apane peeche daudte hue vah aaj karn ko paati thi
 No one can expect anything in Jai's mind, after all, God said that he was desperate to see everyone
 arjuna ! dekho, kis tarah karn sari sena par tut rahaa, kis tarah pandavon kaa paurush hokar ashapak vah lut rahaa 
dekho jis taraf, udhar uske hi baan dikhaayi passage hai, bas, jidhar suno, keval uske hurkaar sunaayi passage hai 
 What a treat! What brevity! How powerful! What kind of attack! With which pride this hero is dwarfing the vihara in the summer-forest! The armpits are torn on the pits, the battle is ruined, not even in the lotus forest
 is purush-singh kaa samar dekh mere to hue nihaal nayan, kuch bura na maano, kahata hum, main aaj ek chir-good vachan 
karn ke saath tera bal bhi main khub jaanata aayaa hum, man-hi-man tujhse bada vir, par ise maanata aayaa hum 
 And seeing extreme bravery today, i think this in the mind, is there anyone who can win this Atul archer in battle? If i taunt Chakra Sudarshan and Gandeev, if you taunt, even then, hardly, today Karna terror will consider us
 yah nahin deh kaa bal keval, antarnabh ke bhi vivasvan, hai kiye hue milakar isko itnaa prachand jajvalyamaan 
saamaanya purush yah nahin, vir yah taponishth vratadhari he ;mrittika-punj yah manuj jyotiyon ke jag kaa adhikari he
 It is a dark summer, with eternal trust of Jai, it is moving fearless, know what divine light is inside! Whenever you see, then the eye is on an alien in front of it, it is forgotten, a mirror its own Is on the body
 arjuna ! tum bhi apane samast vikram-bal kaa aahvaan karo, arjeet asankhya vidyaon kaa ho sajag hriday main dhyaan karo 
jo bhi ho tumme tej, charam par use khinch laana hoga, taiyaar raho, kuch chamatkaar tumko bhi dikhalaanaa hoga
