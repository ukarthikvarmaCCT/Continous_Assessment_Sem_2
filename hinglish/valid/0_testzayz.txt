 fatima jinnah maadar-e millat yani janata kii maan, qaayade aazam ke jivan main maadar-e millat unke hammer uh prabhavi rup se 19 saal rahen yani 1929 se 1948 tak or mrityu shuukravaar ke baad bhi itnaa hi samay jivit raheen
 Our expert historian Ausajya has given a very high position to Maadar Milat as the sister who takes care of quaid-e-azam's house, but he has not paid much attention to the amazing effects he has left on the political map of Pakistan and especially after 1965
 yah ek sarthak baat he ki kaayade ajam ke jivan main maadar millat unke hammer uh prabhavi rup se 19 saal rahen yani 1929 se 1948 tak or mrityu shuukravaar ke baad bhi itnaa hi samay jivit raheen yani 1946 se 1967 tak lekin is duusare daur main unki apni vyakti kuch is tarah ubhari or unke vichaaron bhoomika kuch is tarah nakhre kar saamne aae ki unhen baja liye kaayade ajam kii loktantric 'be baak or paardarshee raajnneetik mulyon ko aazasar nau jivit karne kaa shrey diya ja saktaa he jinhen shaasha bhul chuke the
 In this connection, the prayers expressed by Madar Miltat show his strong hold on contemporary political science and affairs to the extent of unswerving faith
 1965 ke raashtrapati chunaav ke maukey par ayyub khan kii aalochana ke jawaab main maadar millat ne khud kaha tha ki ayyub sainya maamalon kaa visheshgy ho saktaa he lekin raajnneetik samaj or fraasat maine kaayade ajam sidhe praapt he or yah aisa kshetra he jisamen amar bilkul naa deshaantar he
 The events arising after 1965 are enough to corroborate this statement of madamalat
 udhaaharan ke maadar millat ne jin khataron kii baar baar pahchaan kii unamem se kuch hai: The details that Madarmalat gave to warn Noah of other national and international affairs and warn of the threat posed by the government and the public represent his distant eyes and political visionaries
 agar ham ni maadar millat ke rubaru kat anatabah par kaan dhare hote or khataron se bachane kaa aayojan kiya hota jo unki nigahen saaf taur par dekh rahi thim to aaj ham kattarpanthi raajnneetik, aarthik or saamaajik bahraanon kii chapet main na hote jo hamaare raashtra raat or din saamana kar rahi he or yah baat to sunishchit maaloom hoti he ki purvi pakistan kaa daliraash ghatana site vikasshil na hota
 Regardless of the manner in which he spent nights and days and the sacrifices he made for the nation and Muslims, Madar Miltat's political life is certainly a factor in his ideal role
 in karkon main paanch vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai:pehla: vah ek adarsh garillo mahila thim
 a home full of wasteful spending and simple but necessary assurances and facilities
 a system of food and rest for the quaid-e-azam
 When i returned home, i would find a sister and sister present for my reception
 yahi vah santoshjanak or aa soda swadeshi maahaul tha jiske fel apni beemaari ke baavjood kaayade ajam apni puri lagan or ek sui ke saath andolan pakistan kaa mayaabi dilaane kar sake
 Two: One important lesson from Mather Millat's life is that women should have a path to pro-professional education so that they are financially self-sufficient and can also increase the national income
 maadar millat ne daanton ke ilaaj chikitsak main krasis hasil kii or kai saal tak par acts or is dauraan garibon kaa muft ilaaj kiya
 Swayamsevak: Madarmalat has spent almost part of his life in the uncountable social and economic institutions of the head, Sati only and has been instrumental in helping their progress and development, providing services to Kashmiri immigrants with little help
 chauthaa: maadar millat kaa sabase mahatvapurn uplabdhi pakistan ko loktantr ke raste par phir chalane karnaa he unhone 1965 ke raashtrapati chunaav main bhaag lekar andolan pakistan ke hamaa padaarth saarvajanik bhagidaari kii yaaden tazaa kar or purvi or pashchimi pakistan ke bich ek jahati or igaangat ke bhaawanaaon ko jaagruk kiya
 Although he was defeated by rigging, it resulted in the end of Ayub Khan's military ruler within a few years
 madarmalat raajnneetik sangharsh main pakistan kii mahilaon ke liye yah sandesh mazamar he ki raajnneetishastra se sambandhit nahin rahanaa chahie
 Political consciousness should be created within itself and by taking full participation in elections, the country and honest people should be made successful
 pancham: ucch halkonaor satta ke galiyaaron main ghoomane ke baavjood maadare irani islamic shayre ke anusaar rahane or apane aap ko har prakaar ke ghotaale se surakshit rakhaa
 She was very self-respecting and respected like quaid-e-azam
 She was an admirer of Ekta Islami and was keenly interested in teaching Qur'an Majeed's education for a young student
 mahilaon or khaskar chaatraon yah kartavya lagaaya he ki vah kaayade ajam kii priy bahan kii hayaat or sevaaon kaa adhyayan karen or apane bheetar kam se kam vah gun paidaa karen jinka upar ullekh kiya gaya he
 It is through these characteristics that women can contribute in a great way in national development and construction
 maadare irani kuch naye afaroz vichaaron: maadare millat kii hayaat or sevaaon ke adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki pakistan ke samaaj kaa nirmaan or nirmaan or vikaas nitiyon ke bare main spasht vichaar rakhti thim
 As stated earlier, it would not be right to consider them merely a domestic woman
 vah kaayade ajam kii mrityu ke baad 19 saal tak jivit raheen or desh ke raajnneetik, aarthik, saamaajik or shaikshik samasyaon ke bare main tawaatur ke saath apni aara detii raheen
 The Punjab University Research Society of Pakistan has more than two hundred Takahari and its new Afro comments on internal and external matters have been found in other books
 in vichaaron or bayanon maargdarshan ke liye kaayade ajam maujuud na the
 Mather Miltat was very fond of books and studies and thought independently of various matters
 unke vichaaron or vichaaron ke bare main abhi tak koi vishleshiki lekhan nazar nahin lagi
 Here four of his statements are recorded in sample form which reveal the problematic hold of problems: islamic shikshaaon: is samay duniya ajeeb daur se guzar rahi he or yah kahana mushkil he ki kashmakash kaa kya nateeja hoga
 is samay sabase badi samasya jo sari duniya ke liye dard sir bana hua he vah yah ki bani noi insaan main kis tarah igaangat or samanta sthapit kii xxrep 9 
 Kashmir: Then Pakistan faces various issues and it is proven immortal that Kashmir is the most important among them
 pratirohak bindu drushti se kashmir pakistan ke jivan or aatma kii haisiyat rakhata he
 Economically, Kashmir is our source of time
 pakistan ke bade nadi usee rajya kii seemaa se guzar kar pakistan main daakhil hote or hamaari khushhaali main dete iske bina pakistan ke marafi samay khatre main pad jaaegi
 If God does not stop himself, we will be deprived of a large part of the status given to nature by depriving us of Kashmir
 kashmir hamaari madafit kaa pramukh bindu he
 If the enemy gets a chance to form a front in Kashmir Sundarrat valley and mountains, then it is immortal that we will try to interfere in our affairs and run a custom
 so apane aap ko majboot or sachmuch shaktishaalee raashtra banane ke liye yah bahut zaruri he ki pakistan ko dushman kii aisi gatividhiyon kii chapet main na aane diya jaae
 is lihaaj se kashmir kii hamaara pehla kartavya ho jaataa he
 Internal stability: what is the situation today? Internally we are deprived of the nexus of the objective process, externally we do not have the respect and respect we deserve
 aap aasshab nafs or sochen ki uski jimmedaari kis par he nishchit rup se aapako vah adchane pesh nahin jo azaadi se pehle do mahaan shaktishaalee kii tulana main dar pesh thim kiya isaki vajah yah he ki aap ab tak kaa netritv paidaa karne main asafal rahe jo aapke vichaaron or samanta kii sidak dilli se samarthan ho?kayaas vajah yah he ki aap azaadi kaa matlab mehnat or sangharsh ke bajaay aaraam or tan aasaani samaj liya he kya isaki vajah yah he ki apane dushmano ko mauka diya jaae ki vah doston ke bhes menaap kii safon main araajaktaa paidaa karenaor in vichaaron se aapako bahakaayenjan ke liye pakistan samajharaz astitv main aayaa tha
 These are questions that you should answer yourself
 aajkal videsh niti or videsh maamalon par yahaan badi baaten ho rahi hai lekin mere raay he ki in baton main sachai parichit ko bahut kam dakhal he
 It is most welcome that if we rectify the situation, if the vote gets political and economic stability, then it is also considered a privilege abroad

 Democracy: Internal and external problems are in our way

 pakistan kuch jaah pasand logon kii shikaar sthal banane ke liye sthapit nahin hua tha jahaan vah lakhon logon ke aansoon, paseene or khun par pul kar mote hote rahen
 Pakistan was for the attainment of social justice, equality, distillation, collective good, peace and bliss
 aaj hamen is uddeshy se dur phenk diya gaya he
 You must know whose hidden hand is it that has poisoned in public life, there are increasing conspiracies and bargains for private interests and power
 logon ko jamawri adhikaar ke upyog se vanchit rakhane ke liye prayaas ho rahe hai
 You must unite to protect the constitution and stop the trend of non-democracy, demand for early elections is the only solution to this situation

 With Athenian defeated, Thibian survived to fight alone and was surrounded by all fours
 antat: ve haar gaye
 After the victory in Charonia, Philip and Alexander proceeded unopposed to the Peloponnese where they were welcomed by all the cities; However, when they reached Sparta, they were rejected there, but Philip did not resort to war
 kurinth main, philip ne "helinics elliance" kii sthapana kii, jisamen sparta ko chhodkar adhikansh greek shahar-rajya shaamil the
 Philip was named Hégon after this league, and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire
 jab philip pela waapas laut aayaa, to use apane senapati atlus kii bhatiji cleopetra iridiis se pyaar ho gaya or usase vivaah kar liya
 This marriage led to Alexander's claim as heir, as the son born to Cleopatra Irides would have been a complete Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half Macedonian
 vivaah ke bhoj ke dauraan, sharaab ke nashe main atalus ne saarvajanik taur par devataaon se prarthana kii, ki ab macedoniyaan main ek vaid uttaradhikari kaa janm hoga
 Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, leaving her in Dodona, near his maternal uncle, King Alexander i of Epirus
 or khud eliaria chalaa gaya, jahaan usne elian raja se sangrakshan kii maang kii
 Despite being defeated in a battle with Alexander a few years ago, he welcomed Alexander as a guest
 haalanki, aisa prathit hota he ki philip ne kabhi bhi apane raajnneetijna or sainya prashikshit bete ko asweekaar nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Accordingly, Alexander returns to Macedonia after six months due to the efforts of Demratus, a family friend
 agle varsh main, pixodaras, kaaria ke farsi governor ne apni sabase badi beti ko sikandar ke sautele bhai, philip arhidiyas se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Olympius and many of Alexander's friends suggest that Philip intended to make Erhidius his successor
 sikandar ne pixelrus ko ek doot thisslus ko bhej yah batalaai ki use apni beti kaa haath avaidh bete ko dene ke bajaay sikandar ko dena chaiye
 When Philip heard of this, he stopped the offer negotiations and shouted out to Alexander that he wanted to marry Kyu Pixodarus' daughter, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him
 philip ne sikandar ke chaar mitron harpalus, narkus, tolmi or arygiyas ko nirvasit kar diya, or korinthiens ko thisslus ko zanjeeron main laane ke liye bhej diya
 In the summer of 336 BCE, Philip is assassinated by his bodyguard captain, Posnis, while attending the marriage of his daughter Cleopatra in Ayge
 jab posnis bhaagane kaa prayaas kiya, to sikandar ke do saathi, perdicus or leonatas ne uskaa peechha kar use maar daalaa
 At the same time, at the age of 20, Alexander was declared king by the nobles and the army
 singhaasana sambhalate hi sikandar apane pratidwandviyon ko khatm karne laga
 He started by killing his cousin, the former Amintus Fourth
 usne lancastis kshetra ke do macedonian rajkumaron ko bhi maar diya, halanki tisare, alexander lancastis ko chhod diya
 Olympus burned Cleopatra Iridis and Europa, Philip's daughter, alive
 jab alexander ko is bare main pataa chalaa, to vah krodhit hua
 Alexander also ordered the assassination of Atalus, Cleopatra's uncle and advance commander of the Army of Asia campaign
 atlus us samay athens main apane dosharahit hone kii sambhaavna ke bare main demothens se baatcheet karne gaya tha
 Atalus had insulted Alexander several times, and after Cleopatra's murder, Alexander considered it too dangerous to leave him alive
 sikandar ne arhidiyas ko chhod diya, joki sambhawatah olympiyas dwaara jehar dene ke parinamswaroop, maansik rup se viklang ho chukaa tha
 The news of Philip's death led to rebellions in several states, including Thebes, Athens, Thistle and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon
 jab vidroh kii khabar sikandar tak pahunchi, to usne turant us par dhyaan diya
 Instead of using diplomacy, Alexander marched south towards Thistley, forming a 3,000 Macedonian cavalry
 usne paaya kii thisli kii sena, olympius parvat or osa parvat ke bich ke raste par kabja kiye hue he, usne apni sena ko osa parvat par chadhane kaa aadesh diya
 The next day, when the Thistlean army awoke, Alexander found himself standing behind him with his army, and they immediately surrendered
 sikandar ne unki ghudsavaar sena ko apni main mila kar dakshin main pelloponis kii ore kooch karne laga
 Alexander halted at Thermopile, where he was chosen as the leader of the Amphictyonic League, then proceeded south from there to Corinth
 athens ne shanti ke liye guhaar lagaai, jise sikandar ne maan liya or vidrohiyon ko maaf kar diya
 The famous meeting between Alexander and Diogenes Diogenes the Scenic took place in Corinth
 jab sikandar ne diogens se poocha ki vah unke liye kya kar saktaa he, to darshanik ne ghrinaapurvak se sikandar ko ek taraf khadaa hone ke liye kaha, kyonki vah surya ke prakaash ko avaruddh kar rahaa tha
 Alexander was amused by this spot-on answer, and he said, "if i hadn't been Alexander, i wanted to be Diogenes"
 corinth main, jaise philip ko faras ke khilaaf aane vaale yuddh ke liye commander niyukt kiya gaya tha vaise hi sikandar ko hegaman kaa sheershak diya gaya
 Here he also received news of the Thracian rebellion
 asia ko paar karne se pehle, sikandar apni uttari simaaon ko surakshit karnaa chahta tha
 In the spring of 335 BC, he set out to suppress several rebellions
 ampipolis se shuru hokar, vah "swatantra thresian" ke desh main purv kii ore yatra karata rahaa; or hemas parvat par, macedonian sena ne thresian senaaon ko oonchaaiyon par bhi hamalaa kar parajeet kiya

 He turned to Illyria in the west, after Alexander defeated them one by one, forcing both rulers to flee with his Saina
 in jeeton ke saath hi, usne apni uttari seemaa ko surakshit kar liya tha
 While Alexander was on his north expedition, he was informed of the rebellion of Thebes and the Athenian once again and Alexander immediately marched south
 jabaki anya shahar sikandar se takaraane main jhijak rahe the, thibs ne ladaai karne kaa faisla kiya
 Thebes' resistance was ineffective, and Alexander overtook them and annexed the city and divided the region among other Bootian cities
 thibs ke ant ne athens ko chup kar diya or asthaayee taur par hi sahi, saare yunaan par shanti aa gai
 Alexander then left his Asian campaign, leaving Antipiter as regent
 spitameness kii mrityu or roksena ke saath uski nai shaadi ke baad, sikandar ne bhartiya upmahadweep ki ore apana dhyaan le gaya
 He invited all the chiefs of Gandhara, and asked them to take his jurisdiction under Alexander

 Alexander divided his army, and Ambi helped Hephaestion and Pedricus to build the bridge over the Indus River, as well as supplying food to his soldiers
 usne sikandar or uski puri sena kaa uski rajdhani takshashila shahar main dosti kaa sabase bada pradarshan karte hue sabase udaar aatithy ke saath swaagat kiya
 As Alexander advanced, Taxila took part in the Battle of the Jhelum River, with the help of an army of 5,000 of his men
 is yuddh main vijay ke baad, sikandar ne ambhi ko puruvas se baatcheet ke liye bheja, jisamen poras kaa sara rajya sikadanr ke adheen karne jaisi sharten peshkash kii gai, chunki aambhi or poras puraane dushman the usne sabhi sharten thukraa di or ambhi badi mushkil se apni zindagi bachaa vahaan se bhaag paaya
 However, the two rivals were then reconciled by Alexander to personal mediation; And Takshashila, due to the contribution of equipment and forces to the fleet on the Jhelum, Ambi was assigned the entire area between the Jhelum River and the Indus; He gained more power after the death of Machatus' son Philip; After Alexander's death and subsequent partition of the provinces in Triparadisus in 321 BCE, he was allowed to retain his authority

 "A similar massacre was also carried out in Ora
 massaga or ora ke baad, kai assensian arons ke kile main bhaag gaye
 Alexander followed them and after four days of bloody fighting captured this strategic hill-fort
 arons ke baad, 326 isa purv main sikandar ne sindhu ko paar kiya or raja poras ke khilaaf ek mahayuddh jeeta, jiskaa jhelum or chenab nadi ke bich vaale kshetra par shashan tha, jo ab punjab kaa kshetra kehalaata hai

 The optic nerve is covered by all three cerebrospinal layers, not the epineurium, perineurium, and endo-neurium found in peripheral nerves
 The fiber tracks of the central nervous system of mammals are unable to regenerate and damage in the hepatic optic nerve produces irreversible blindness

 matbhed samaadhaan se taatpary kisi sangharsh ko shantipurna dhang se ant kar dene kii vidhi yaa prakriya se he
 Realists believe that international politics is a struggle for power between states
 anya vidwaanon kaa bhi mat he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti vibhinn rajyon ke antargat hone vaali prakriyaaon kaa rup hoti he
 But the national interests of all states are not equal, so the conflict between states becomes inevitable
 sangharshon kaa swaroop, vishay kshetra va kshamta vibhinn ho sakati he
 Perhaps for this reason, before knowing about the resolution of conflicts, a brief knowledge about the nature and type of conflicts is also very important
 saamaanya rup se sangharshon ko do bhaagon main hi baanta ja saktaa he - ahimsaatmak va hinsaatmak
 From the point of view it appears that it is very easy to understand the nature of conflicts based on this classification
 parantu aaj ke vartmaan sandarbh main sainya sadhano ke ati aadhuniktam shastron kii utpatti ke kaaran yah pataa lagaana itnaa saral nahin he ki amuk sangharsh hinsaatmak he yaa ahimsaatmak
 Many times nations fulfill their interests just by pretending to be violent tendencies
 atah sangharsh ke bare main jaankaree hetu unke hiton kaa vistrut gyaan anivaary ban jaataa he
 That is why many authors divide conflicts into the following two major categories analytically
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke badlaav ke daur kii sthiti main shakti vibhajit rahati he tath asthirataa bani rahati he
 In such a situation, the states have only limited options
 atah aapaki sangharshon kii sthiti main keval santulan ke uddeshy prapti hetu hi prayaas karata he
 Those conflicts are called conflicts for balanced purposes
 is shrenee main nimna prakaar ke sangharshon ko sammilit kiya ja saktaa he- The conflict became synonymous with the conflict conflict between the former Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War
 donon ke bich sangharsh shastron kii hode, sainya kshamta kaa vikaas, sainya addon kii sthapana, kachche maal par niyantran, sahyogiyon kii nirantar talash aadi par aadhaarit ban gaya tha
 As a result, both were psychologically competing to dominate each other
 is prakaar ke sangharsh main rajya apni shakti vistaar ke saath-saath samooh ko sangathit karne tathaa use or pratiyogic banane kii hode main leen ho gaya
 In this way, the world was divided into two groups in a purely ideological form
 is prakaar ke sangharsh ko 'varchasv sthapana hetu sangharsh' kaha ja saktaa he
 Long distance plans have to be made for this type of struggle and it goes on continuously
 iske atirikt, donon ke bich is sthiti main sampoorn yuddh kii sambhaavnaaen bhi atyadhik rup se vyaapt rahati hai
 It is easy to start conflicts, but it is very difficult to continue them for a long time
 atah prayek raashtra sangharshon se bachanaa chaahate hai
 But once the conflict starts they can be avoided only through four options- duusari sthiti ati uttam hoti he parantu yah tabhi sambhav he jab donon pratidwandvi samjhauta karnaa chaahate hon tathaa apni nunatam uplabdhi ke sandarbh main samaan vichaar rakhte hon
 Indeterminate situation occurs when both participants are stubborn and profit and loss are uncertain
 is prakaar ke sangharsh bina kisi dikhaave ke tut jate hai
 The state of conflict in international relations emphasizes the discovery of various means and techniques by the states to resolve them
 parantu in sadhano kii khoj va unki safalataa sangharsh ke uddeshyon, swaroop evam virdohi partiyon ke hiton par nirbhar karti he
 In addition, it is also true that not all conflicts require different methods of resolution, but sometimes conflicts are resolved only by leaving them on their own
 lekin kai baar bhaavnaatmak swaroop ati teevr rup dhaaran kar letaa he tab vivaadon kaa aupchaarik hal dhundhna aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Many times, the disputes with which states associate their self-esteem cannot be easily resolved

 Muttuswamy was named after Selvamuttu Kumaraswamy located in the Vaidyeswaran temple
 aisi manyata he ki muttuswami kaa janm unke mata or pita ke bhagavan vaidyeshwaran kii prarthana karne se hua tha
 Muttuswamy had two younger brothers, Baluswami and Chinnaswamy, and his sister's name was Balambal
 muttuswami ke pita ramswami dikshit ne hi raag hansadhvani kaa udbhav kiya tha
 Muttuswamy started teaching religion, literature, ornamentation and mantra knowledge from his childhood and he had studied music from his father
 muttuswami ke kishoravastha main hi, unke pita ne unhen chidambaranath yogi naamak ek bhikshu ke saath tirthayatra par sangeet or darshanik gyaan praapt karne ke liye bhej diya tha
 During this pilgrimage, he visited many places in North India and got a comprehensive view on religion and music which was reflected in his many compositions
 kaashi main apane pravaas ke dauraan, unke guru chidambarnath yogi ne muttuswami ko ek adwitiya veena pradaan kii or uske sheeghra baad hi unka nidhan ho gaya
 The samadhi of Chidambaranath Yogi can still be seen in the Srichakra Lingeshwar temple in Hanuman Ghat area of varanasi
 muttuswami dikshit kaa janm tamilnadu ke tiruvarur main tamil brahman danpati, ramswami dikshit or subbamma ke yahan, sabase bade putr ke rup main hua tha
 Keeping in mind the tradition of Brahmin education, Muttu Swami learned and studied the Sanskrit language, Vedas and other major religious texts deeply
 unako praarambhik shiksha unke pita se mili thi
 After some time, Muttuswamy went to Benares or Varanasi with the great saint Chidambaranath Yogi to learn music and there was a period of learning and study for 5 years
 guru ne unhen mantropadesh diya va unako hindustani shastreey sangeet kii shiksha di
 Muttuswamy returned to South India after the Guru's death
 jab tab vah chidambarnath yogi ke saath rahe, unhone uttar bharat main kaaphi bhraman kiya va kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mila
 a special veena was also given to him by his Guru during study and reading
 puranic katha ke anusaar, muttuswami ke guru unhen tiruttani kii yatra karne ke liye kaha
 There, while he was sitting in meditation posture, an old man came to him and asked him to open his mouth
 buudhe aadmi unke munh main shakkar kii mithai rakh gaayab ho gaya
 As he opened his mouth, he had visions of the deity Murugan, and only then did Muttuswamy sing his first composition "sri Nathadi guruguho" in the raga Meyamalavagola
 is geet ne bhagwaan ko sanskrit main pehali vibhakti main sambodhit kiya, baad main dikshit ne bhagwaan ke sabhi aath avtaron par kritiyon kii rachana kii
 These were mostly in the sub-sections praising Murugan in sect / indulgent form
 phir muttuswami tirthaton ke nikal gayi or kanchi, tiruvannamalai, chidambaram, tirupati or kalahasti, shrirangam ke mandiron kii yatra or vahaan kritiyon kii rachana kii or tiruvarur laut aaye
 Muthuswamy Dixit had proficiency on Veena, and Veena's performance can be clearly seen in his compositions, especially in Gaman
 unki kriti balgopal main, unhone khud ko veena gayak ke rup main parichay diya
 He also majored on violin and among his disciples, along with Thanjavilu of Thanjavur quartet and his brother Baluswamy Dixit, took the lead in using violin in Carnatic music, which is now an integral part of most Carnatic artists
 tiruvarur lautne par, unhone tiruvarur mandir parisar main har devtaa ke upar kriti kii rachana kii, jisamen tyagaraj, peethasin devtaa, nilotlambal, unki patni or devi kamalambal aadi shaamil the
 This happened when he composed the famous Kamalamba Navvarna Kriti, which was filled with exemplary literature on the deity Srichakra
 ye navavarnan sanskrit bhashaa ke sabhi aath avadharanaon main the or prayek varsh guruguh jayanti par gaaya jaataa he
 He continued to demonstrate his skills by creating a Navagraha work in praise of the nine planets
 sahitya ke geet, mantra or jyotish shastron ke gahare gyaan ko darshaate he
 Nilotlambal Kriti is another outstanding collection of his compositions that revived the dying ragas like Narayangaul, Purvagaul and Chaagaul
 thanjore ke chaar nritak guru bhaaiyon chinnaya, ponneya, vadivalu or shivanandam ne muthuswami dikshit se sampark kiya, or unase sangeet seekhney kii ichha vyakt kii or unase thanjore main unke saath aane ke liye aagrah kiya
 There, Dixit imparted to him the teachings of the 72 Mela tradition distributed by Venkata Vaidyanath Dixit
 chaatro ne apane guru ko mahima karte hue navratna maala naamak nau geeton kii ek sangrah banaakar unhain samarpit kiya
 These four disciples are also known as Thanjavur quartet and are honored as the lead composer for Bharatanatyam
 unke shishyon main, ponanya or chinanya ne tiruvanantpuram ke shri swati thirunal ke raaj-darbar kalakaaron ke rup main bhi kaam kiya
 At a young age, Dixit was exposed to the music of Western bands at Fort St
 George
 baad ke charan main, dikshit ne kuch chalis geeton ko kai dhunon main banaaya, jaise ki sankarbharana
 This work is now known as Nottuswara literature
 in rachanaaon main celtic or barok shaileyon kaa prabhaav kaaphi spasht he 
 There is a misconception that these were written on the orders of CP Brown, the collector of Cuddappa
 yah sambhav nahin he kyonki donon kabhi nahin mili
 Muttuswamy Dixit left Madras by 1799
 brown, 1817 main madras aaye, 1820 main unhone telegu sikhi or usee varsh kuddappa main chale gaye
 In 1835, Muttuswamy prayed like every day on the wonderful, divine and holy Vela of Deepawali
 tatpashchaat unhone apane vidhyaarthiyon ko "minakshi me mudam dehi" geet gane ke liye kaha
 The song was composed in the Eastern Kalyani Raga
 ve aage bhi kai geet gaate rahe, jaise hi unhone "min lochani pash mochani" gaanaa shuru kiya tabhi muttuswami ne apane haathon ko uthaate hue "shive paahi" kahkar divangat ho gaye
 His samadhi is in Ettaiyapuram

 Muttuswamy visited many pilgrimages and temples and saw deities
 unhone bhagwaan murugan yaa muruga yaa kartikeya, jo tiruttani ke aradhya dev hai ke darshan kiye or unki prashansa main kai geet rach daale
 It was in Tiruttani that he composed his first work, "sri Nathadi Guruguho Jayati"
 yah geet mayamalavgulam raag va aadi taal main rachaa gaya tha
 He then made pilgrimage to many famous temples
 mana jaataa he ki dikshitar ne lagbhag 3000 se bhi adhik geeton kii rachana kii, joki dev-prashansa par yaa kisi nek bhaavana par aadhaarit thim
 Many of these compositions have now been destroyed
 unke dwaara rachit kritiyon main navagraha kriti, kamalamba navavaranam kriti, abhayamba navavaranam kriti, shiv navavaranam kriti, panchaling sthal kriti, maniparval kriti aadi sammalit hai
 Muttuswamy has given special mention to Bhava, Raga and Taal etc
 in all his compositions
 muttuswami dikshitar ko unke upnaam "guruguh" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 All his compositions have been composed in the fourth phase
 unki kriti "balgopal" main ve vainik gayak naam se prasiddh hue

 unki rachanaaen adhikanshat: sanskrit ke kriti rup main hai, arthath, sangitamay kavita ke rup main he
 Muttuswamy traveled to many holy pilgrimages throughout his life and composed creations on deities and temples
 dikshit ko devataaon ke liye sabase vistrut shrinkhalaa kaa rachiyata mana jaataa he
 Each of his works is presented in a unique and talented manner
 rachanaaen gaharaai or maadhurya kii aatma ke liye jane jate hai- kuch raagon ke lekar unki pariklpana abhi bhi unki sanrachanaon par maanya hai
 His Sanskrit songs praise the temple deity, but removing the implicit relationship between Advaita philosophy and polytheistic worship, Muthuswamy has given the origin of Advaita thought in his songs
 unke geeton main mandir ke itihaas or uski prishthbhumi ke bare main bahut jaankaree di gai he, jiske kaaran hi aaj in puraane tirthon main kai paramparaon ko banaae rakhaa gaya he
 Another important feature in his compositions is the verses versed in the lines of the songs
 muttuswami ne sabhi 72 melkarta raagon kii rachana karne kii pariyojna ko apanaaya, jisase kai durlabh or lupt raagon ke liye sangeet kaa udhaaharan mil sakaa

 Windows Vista is the latest in a series of Microsoft operating systems and possibly the most revolutionary after Windows 95
 haalaanki vista oparating system ko adhik lokapriyata uske triayami graphics swaroop or vibhinn desktop onimeshan kii vajah se mili he lekin vastav main yah microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya ab tak kaa sabase surakshit oparating system bhi mana ja rahaa he
 It is also more efficient in terms of communication and networking than its previous operating system
 vista ke liye hindi samarthan bhi puri tarah uplabdh he or hindi language interphes pack ke madhyam se windos vista ko puri tarah hindi ke rang main ranga ja saktaa he
 Computer users have a curiosity about whether they really need to adopt Windows Vista, the new operating system released by Microsoft
 kya microsoft ke pichley oparating system windos ekspe windos 2003 or windos 2000 kii tulana main isamen aise fitures hai jinaki andekhi karnaa sambhav na ho
 Microsoft claims that Vista is more capable, simpler, faster, smooth and secure than previous Windows
 vista pichley oparating systams kii tulana main adhik teji se khulata or band hota he
 Start up and shutdown processes are completed in five to ten seconds
 haalaanki isamen vista ke apekshaakrit behatar hardware kaa bhi yogadan he lekin khud oparating system ke code main bhi iske liye vishesh prayaas kiya gaya he
 Vista's boom is also due to its new memory management technology that keeps the most used applications ready for loading in advance
 ise 'memri fech' kaha jaataa he
 The Ready Boost feature in Vista has also contributed to its speed
 ab tak windos main memri sambandhi atirikt aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye virtual memri ke rup main pejafilon kaa istemaal hota tha
 These were placed on the computer's hard disk
 lekin vista main iske liye yuasabi drive kaa istemaal karne kaa praavdhaan he jo hard discs kii tulana main bahut tej gati se kaary karti he
 Microsoft has also provided hybrid hard drive support to its new operating system, which increases computer speed by using both flash drives and traditional hard drives combined
 windos vista main sabase pehle dhyaan khinchne vaali cheez he iskaa windos airo naamak khubasurat mukhaawaran or graphic effects
 Although such Sudarshan graphics are already present on Macintosh computers, they are first exposed through 'vista' on the Windows platform
 windos vista home premium, bijness, ultimate or enterprise sanskarnon se yukt un computaron par jinamein ek acha graphics adeptor maujuud ho, airo ke mohak graphics effects kaa anand liya ja saktaa he
 This assertion has changed the core of Windows and has made it much more attractive, diversified and decent than before
 airo ke ucch gunvattta vaale graphics or drishy prabhaavon ne windos computer kaa saundarya to badhaayaa he lekin uski vajah se computer kii kaaryakshmata yaa gati main koi kami nahin aati
 Aero has two major features - Windows Flip and Windows Flip 3D
 inke madhyam se aap apane desktop ko zyada suvidhajanak rup se vyavasthit kar sakate hai
 There has been a general perception among Microsoft users about Microsoft's operating systems that they are less secure than their rival operating systems and are relatively more vulnerable to viruses, hacking, spa ware, etc
 microsoft ne vista main is baat par khaas dhyaan diya he
 Although Vista's original 'kernel' is not rewritten, its security has been strengthened this time
 pehali baat to yah ki ab is oparating system ke sabhi bhaag karnel mod main nahin chalate balki unamem se kuch chuninda hisse hi chalate hai
 Most drivers and software in Vista run in user mode and it is no longer easy to install anything in kernel mode
 iske liye sicurity certificate or administrator str ke adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 And it would be very difficult to get administrator level privileges, especially in offices
 windos vista main saamaanya upyogkarta ke adhikaar simit hai
 It is also not that you as a normal user cannot install the software in your computer
 aisa karne ke liye unhen asthaayee taur par jaruri adhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Microsoft has created two categories of computers for installing Vista operating system - Vista Capable PC and Vista Premium Ready
 aise sabhi computer windos vista sakasham hai jinamein kam se kam 800 megahatrj kaa procesar or 512 embi system memri uplabdh ho
 Such processors are rare now because hardly anyone is buying less than 2 ghz processor in the market
 yadi aapane pichley do ek saalon main apana computer kharida he to uskaa procesar kam se kam itani kshamta kaa avashya hoga
 It may be a matter of system memory that your traditional computer may have 128 MB or 256 MB memory
 aise main aapako saat-aath sau rupye kharch karke apni ram kaa apgredation karwaanaa pad saktaa he
 For Windows Vista capable computers there must be at least a graphics card supporting Direct X9 with WDDM driver support available
 computer ke graphics card main 32 embi kii graphics memri ho to paryaapt he
 Additionally, you will need a DVD ROM drive which may already be present in your computer
 hard discs main mahaj 20 jibi sthaan uplabdh ho, jisamen se 15 jibi khaali sthaan ho, to paryaapt he
 Simply, you don't need anything else to run Windows Vista Home Basic Edition
 mobile 8 Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the basis of sustainable mechanics
 ye niyam kisi vastu par lagane vaale bal or usase utpann us vastu kii gati ke bich sambandh bataate hai
 They have been expressed in many ways in three centuries
 newton ke gati ke teenon niyam, parmparik rup se, sankshep main nimnlikhit hai- Newton first compiled them in his book Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica
 newton ne anek sthanon par bhautik vastuon kii gati se sambandhit samasyaon kii vyakhya main inkaa prayog kiya tha
 In the third part of his book, Newton demonstrated that these three laws of motion and their universal law of gravitation are capable of interpreting Kepler's laws related to the motion of celestial bodies
 newton ke gati niyam sirf unhi vastuon par lagaaya jaataa he jinhen ham ek kan ke rup main maan sake
 Meaning that when measuring the speed of those objects, their size is ignored
 un vastuon ke pind ko ek bindu main kendrit man kar in niyamo ko lagaaya jaataa he
 This is done when the distances in the analysis are much larger than the objects
 isliye grahon ko ek kan maan kar unke kakshiya gati ko mapa ja saktaa he
 In its original form, the rules of these motions cannot be applied to fixed and deformable bodies
 1750 main leonard ular ne newton ke gati niyamo kaa vistaar kiya or ular ke gati niyamon kaa nirmaan kiya jinhen drudh or virupanshil pindo par bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If an object is considered to be a combination of discrete particles, in which Newton's laws of motion can be applied separately, Euler's law of motion can be derived from Newton's law of motion
 newton ke gati niyam bhi kuch nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hote he jinhen jadtviya nirdesh tantra kaha jaataa he
 Many authors believe that the first rule defines the inertial instruction system and the second law is valid only with those instruction systems, for this reason the first rule cannot be called a special form of the second law
 par kuch pehle niyam ko duusare kaa parinaam maanate he
 The explicit concept of directive systems developed long after Newton died
 newtoni yantriki kii jagah ab oinstin ke vishesh aapekshikta ke siddhant ne le lee he par phir bhi iskaa istemaal prakaash kii gati se kam gati vaale pindon ke liye abhi bhi kiya jaataa he
 In Newton's original words hindi anuwaad "every object remains in its stagnation or uniform velocity until it is induced to change its state by some external factor
 " In other words, the object which is in resting state will remain in the resting state and the object which is in motion will remain in motion unless any external force is applied on it
 newton kaa pratham niyam padaarth ke ek prakritik gun jadtv ko paribhaashit karat he jo gati main badlaav kaa virodh karata he
 Therefore, the first law is also called the law of inertia
 yah niyam apratksh rup se jadtviya nirdesh tantra tathaa bal ko bhi paribhaashit karata he
 Because of this, this rule was put first by Newton
 is niyam kaa saral pramanikaran mushkil he kyonki gharshan or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ko zyaadaatar pind mahasoos karte hai
 Actually, Galileo described this observation before Newton
 newton ne anya shabdon main ise vyakt kiya
 In Newton's original words: hindi main anuwaad "A change in the momentum of an object is proportional to the impact on the object and occurs in the same direction
" "newton ke is niyam se adholikhit bindu vyupatrit kiye ja sakate he : Where f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} force, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} momentum and t { \ displaystyle t} are time
 is sameekaran ke anusaar, jab kisi pind par koi bahya bal nahin he, to pind kaa samveg sthir rahata he
 When the mass of the body is constant, the equation can be written in a simpler form: jahaan m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman he or a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} twaran he
 That is, the acceleration of a body is proportional to the force applied
 aaveg dwitiya niyam se sambandhit he
 Impulse means a change in momentum
 arthath: Where i is the impulse
 aaveg takkaron ke vishleshan main bahut ahm he
 Let the mass of a body be m
 is par ek niyam bal f ko ∆tsamayanwarala ke liye lagane par veg main ∆v parivartit ho jaataa he
 Then Newton- atah kisi pind ko diya gaya aaveg, pind main utpann samveg- parivartan ke samaan hota he
 Therefore, the unit of impulse is the same as that of the impulse
 tritiy niyam kaa arth he ki kisi bal ke sangat ek or bal he jo uske samaan or vipareet he
 Newton used this rule to describe the law of momentum conservation, but actually momentum conservation is a more fundamental principle
 kai udahaaran hai jinamein samveg sangrakshit hota he lekin tritiy niyam maanya nahin he

 Because of this, Brar learned daily life skills very late in life
 yah uske liye ek badi chunauti thi
 Constant discrimination and segregation by her classmates and not being included in various events because she was blind also created an intrinsic motivation in Kerala to change the condition of the blind

 In mathematics, even numbers are said to be completely divisible by 2, such as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, etc
 yahi kehane kaa ek or tarika he ki sabhi sam ank 2 ke gunaj hote hai
 Unlike this, odd digits are called digits that are not divisible by 2, such as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc
 yadhyapi mul rup se sam-visham kii avadharana anko par lagaai jaati thi, aadhunik ganit main ise anya chizon par bhi lagu kiya jaataa he
 Mathematical parity of something is its characteristic that it is even or odd
 yadi koi sankhya sam he to uskaa antim ank bhi sam hi hota he or isi tarah visham sankhya kaa antim ank bhi keval visham hi ho saktaa he
 For example, if 12,34,347 is divided by 2 it will be found to be odd and it can be told immediately by looking at its last digit without dividing it because 7 itself is an odd digit

 In every organization, it is the managers who plan, organize, direct and control the resources and activities
 samay-samay par, prabandh pratibhaaon ke vikaas ke mahatv ko manyata pradaan kiye jane se, in dinon adhiktar sanghathan prabandh vikaas par atyaadhik dhyaan dene lage hai
 Only skilled managers can give organizations a certain amount of time
 aane vaale samay main, jabaki vyavsaayik vaataavaran or bhi adhik gatisheel evam jatil ho jaayegaa, tab prabandhakon kaa mahatv bhi uttarottar bad jaayegaa
 In addition, the important assumption of the modern manager is that 'managers are not born but are developed
 ' Management development is a systematic process by which managers develop their ability to manage

 Nyaya Darshan is one of the six Vedic philosophies of India
 iske pravartak rishi akshapaad gautam hai jinka nyayasutra is darshan kaa sabase pracheen evam prasiddh granth he
 The means by which we get the knowledge of the known elements, the same means are called 'justice'
 devraj ne 'nyaay' ko paribhaashit karte hue kaha he- In other words, with the help of which a theory can be reached, it is called justice
 pramaanon ke aadhaar par kisi nirnay par pahunchnaa hi nyaay he
 It is mainly logic and metaphysics
 ise tarkshastra, pramanshastra, hetuvidya, vadavidya tathaa anvikshiki bhi kaha jaataa he
 Vatsyayan has done the test of proof of justice
 ) is drushti se jab koi manushya kisi vishay main koi siddhanth sthir karata he to vahaan nyaay kii sahaayta apekshit hoti he
 Therefore, justice-philosophy is the fundamental need and origin of a thoughtful human society
 uske bina na manushya apane vichaaron evam siddhanton ko parishkrut evam susthir kar saktaa he na pratipakshi ke saiddhanthik aghaton se apane siddhanth kii raksha hi kar saktaa he
 Jurisprudence is the gateway to the Sanskrit literature of the highest order
 uske praarambhik parigyaan ke bina kisi unche sanskrit sahitya ko samaj paanaa kathin he, chaahe vah vyakaran, kavy, alankaar, ayurveda, dharmagranth ho yaa darshanagranth
 In philosophy, it is impossible to walk even a step without it
 nyaayashastra vastutah buddhi ko suprishkrut, teevr or vishad banane vaala shaastra he
 But as important and useful as jurisprudence is, it is also very difficult, especially as Navyanya is made up of collecting mischief
 vaisheshik darshan kii hi bhaanti nyaayadarshan main bhi padaarthon ke tatv gyaan se nickshreys kii siddhi bataayi gayi he
 There are 16 substances considered in the judiciary- gautam ke ‘nyayasutra’ se hi nyaayashastra kaa itihaas spasht rup se prarambh hota he
 Discussion of certain principles of this jurisprudence in ancient texts is still widely available today; But no one has the right knowledge of what was the proper and holistic form of that ancient logic
 ‘buddha darshan’ ke prakarnon main yah ullekh miltaa he ki buddha mat vaale apane mat kaa pratipaadan aastik siddhanton ke viruddh kiya karte the
 To prohibit this, the structure of the judiciary was formed
 buddha kaa samay chhathi shatabdi isa purv mana jaataa he
 This was the time when Gautama composed jurisprudence
 nyaayadarshan kaa ek naam tarkshastra bhi he
 In some places in the ancient scriptures, Gautama and in some places, Akshapad has been called the author of the judiciary
 acharya vishweshwar kii tarkbhasha kii bhoomika ke antargat prishth 11-20 main iskaa ullekh he
 The 'indian Philosophy' by Umesh Mishra states that logic was even before Buddhists and was very broad
 iske bhinn-bhinn pracheen naam hai
 Such as - Astrology, Hetology, Hetology, Logic, Logistics, Rhetoric, Evidence, Vakovakya, Takki, Vimansi etc
 nyayasutra kii sanrachana kab hui, iskaa nirnay kar paanaa bahut kathin he
 The reason is that the scholars wrote BC Have presented their beliefs between the sixth century to the fifth century BCE; But everyone has their own arguments
 usase kisi nishchit nirnay par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 Overall views of jurisprudence can be divided into two streams - the theorem and thesis
 gautam se gangashopadhyaay ke purv tak ke vidwaanon kii rachanaaon ke vichaar prameyapradhan hai or gangashopadhyaay kii tatvachintamani tathaa usapar aadhaarit parvarti vidwaanon kii rachanaaon ke vichaar pramanpradhan hai
 The bibliography of the theorem is called 'ancient justice' and the bibliography with the proof of thought is called 'new justice'
 pracheen nyaay kii bhashaa saral or padaarthvivechan sthool he tathaa navy nyaay kii bhashaa jatil or padaarthvivechan sookshm he
 The literature available after the Nyasutra is considered to be the first place of Vatsyayanized 'nyayabhasya'
 nyaaybhashya par ‘nyaayavarthik’ naam kii ek tikaa ‘udyotkar’ ne likhi he, jisamen nyaayashastra ke pramayon ke sahi swaroop ko jaanane kii sarvaadhik upadeyata vidyaman he
 Their period is also around the fifth-sixth century of Christ
 udyotkar dwaara rachit ‘nyaayavarthik’ naamak tikaa prakashit hone ke pashchaat bhi nyaayashastra par baudhon kaa aghat band nahin hua, jiske kaaran khyatipraapt tikaakar vachaspati mishra ko nyaayavarthik ke upar bhi ek tikaa likhni padi, jo ‘nyaayavarthikataatparytika’ ke naam se prasiddh atyadhik mahatvapurn tikaa he
 Scholars consider the time of Vachaspati Mishra to be the ninth century CE
 inhone hi is nyaayashastra ko shuddh evam lipibaddh kiya
 Due to this purity, it is available today that there are 5 chapters and 10 chapters in the judiciary, 84 cases and 528 sutras, 196 posts and 8385 letters
 bhartiya darshan main pramaan use kehete hai jo satya gyaan karne main sahaayta kare, arthath vah saadhan yaa prakriya jisase kisi duusari baat kaa yatharth gyaan ho
 Evidence is the main subject of justice
 'prama' naam he yatharth gyaan kaa
 Whatever is the reason of real knowledge, that is, through which there is real knowledge, it is called proof
 nyaayadarshan main pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd - ye chaar pramaan maane gaye hai
 It refutes the evidence of historical, economic, possible and lack of it
 pratyaksh pramaan ke do bhed hai- bahya or abhyantar
 The olfactory, percussion, eye, eye, and srotra, these "senses" are external evidence, due to the senses being in the upper part of the body and the client of external matters, and the mind being with the soul inside the body and the inner substance of the soul and Being a customer of kindred qualities, it is called "internal direct evidence"
 pratyaksh shabd se indriya, tajjanya gyaan or unke vishay in teenon kaa bodh hota he
 These three types of realizations arise from the following derivatives respectively: indriya rup pratyaksh pramaan kii sankhya chha: hone se tajjanya gyaanon kii sankhya chha: hoti he or unhen idriyadvarak naamon se vyavahrut kiya jaataa he, jaise- ghranaj, rasana, chakshush, twaach, shravan or maanas in pratyaksh gyaanon main prayek ke do bhed hote hai- nirviklpak or saviklpak
 Nirvikalak - In this direct, there is a sense of the nature of the object, its subject matter, there is no value of relationship; Therefore, the subjectivity of this direct is characteristic of the particularity and compatibility and that unique subjectivity is the symptom of this direct
 yah atindriya hota he arthath iskaa pratyaksh nahin hota
 It is inferred in the form of "optional direct"
 saviklpak - yah pratyaksh vishishtagrahi hota he
 Its subjectivity is of three types by distinction of specialness-type, specialness and compatibility
 yah nirviklpak" se utpann hota he or man se iskaa pratyaksh vedan hota he
 Its direct is treated by the term "attrition"
 prayek janya saviklpak pratyaksh ke do bhed hote hai- loukik or alokik
 Cosmic - is the customer of the direct current and the nearest object
 uskaa janm vastu ke saath indriya ke loukik sannikarsh se hota he; ve sannikarsh chha: hai - sanyog, sanyukt samavaay, sanyuktasmawet samavaay, samavaay, samavet samavaay or visheshantaa
 These include the combination of matter by combination, the properties of matter by joint, the property of karma and general, the property of combination and common with group, the word for group, the word with group, and the general of word with specialness
 alokik - alokik pratyaksh duurastha or avidhyman padaarth ko bhi grahan karata he
 He is born with a supernatural dilemma of the senses with the subject
 alokik sannikarsh teen hai- saamanyalakshan, gyanalakshan or yogaj
 Common symptoms - Known general or general knowledge is called general symptoms
 isse samipsth, duurastha, vidyaman or avidhyman sabhi prakaar ke samast samanyashrayon kaa pratyaksh hota he
 This direct occurs in the same condition when the contents of the cosmic direct of an ordinary shelter are embodied
 isi sannikarsh kii mahima se kisi ek maatr dhooma main kisi ek maatr vahri ke saahchary gyaan se hi sab dhoomon main sab vahri kii vyapti kaa gyaan ho jaataa he tathaa sannikrusht dhooma main vahri kii vyapti kaa nishchay rahete hue bhi asannikrusht dhooma main vahrivyabhichaar kaa andeh hota he
 Gyanalakshan - Knowledge of Tattad subject is called "gyanalakshana" of the senses along with Tattad subject
 is sannikarsh se gyaan ke vishay kaa hi pratyaksh hota he, uske aashray kaa nahin
 With this effect, the misleading of the religion of one substance in another is visible
 yogaj - yogabhyas se manushya kii aatma main ek vishisht dharm kaa udai hota he
 This religion is called the yogic approximation of the senses with the subject
 isse indriyon kaa samathrya bad jaataa he, jiske falswaroop indriyaan duurastha or avidhyman padaarth kaa bhi pratyaksh karne lagati hai
 It is through his influence that the yogi attains servility
 nity pratyaksh - is sandarbh main yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki ukt janya pratyakshon se atirikt ek nity pratyaksh bhi he, jo ajanma evam avinashi he
 He directly subjects the whole world and is the cause of all actions as gratuitous
 vah ekmaatr ishwar main hi samavet rahata he
 By inference proof, knowledge of all those substances which, despite having ability to be known by the senses, are not known to the senses due to being remote or non-sensible or which do not have the ability to be known by the senses
 iske do bhed hote hai - swaarthanumaan or pararthanumaan
 The presumption that resolves a doubt or verifies itself is called a "self-prediction" and the inference that the other person - curious, respondent or arbitrator - resolves or verifies the skeptic is called a "prediction" goes
 "swaarthanumaan" kii nishpatti anya purush ke vachan kii apeksha na kar apane prayaas se hetu main saadhy kii vyapti kaa gyaan arjeet kar kii jaati he or "pararthanumaan" kii nishpatti anya purush ke vachan se arthath panchavyavatmak nyaay ke prayog se vyaptigyaan praapt kar kii jaati he
 That is why Gangeshopadhyay has clearly stated in the element of Tattvacinthamani- nyaay - isaki paribhaasha aarambh main bataai gai he
 Its five components are considered in jurisprudence - vows, for, examples, subunits and guimans
 jis vaakya se paksh ke saath saadhy ke sambandh kaa gyaan ho use "pratigya", jis vaakya se hetu main saadhy kii gyaapakataa avgat ho use "hetu", jis vaakya se hetu main saadhy kii vyapti bataai jaae use "udhaaharan", jis vaakya se paksh main saadhyvaakya hetu kaa sambandh bodhit ho use "upanay" or jis vaakya ke hetu kaa abadhitatv evam asatpratipakshitatv bataate hue hetu ke samarthy se paksh main saadhy ke sambandh kaa upsanhaar kiya jaae use "nigaman" kaha jaataa he
 Their examples are in order: isi panchavyavatmak vaakya ko vatsyayan ne "param nyaay" kaha he
 For, Vyaptigyan or Vyapti Jnana, the enlightened mind is called inference
 inamen teesraa paksh bahut hi kam prasiddh he par pratham do paksh adhik prasiddh hai
 Udayanacharya and his followers call "liut" and Gangesopadhyay and his followers Vyaptigyan are estimates
 nyaay darshan main anumaan ke teen bhed bataae gaye hai- purvawat, sheshwat or saamanyatodrusht
 Vatsyayana has given two types of interpretations of these estimates as follows: 1
 purvawat = ek aashray main ek saath pratyaksh do padaarthon main jaise- paakshala main ek pratyaksh dekhe gaye dhooma or ek se duusare kaa purv kii bhanti saath hone kaa anumaan vahri main dhooma se parvat vahni kaa anumaan 2
 Sheshvat = Prohibition of the person and the absence of attraction elsewhere, such as - being emotional, estimating the substance, properties, deeds, common residual substance
 vishesh or samavaay main shabd ke antarbhaav kii prasakti honaper satta jati kaa aashray hone se saamaanya, vishesh or samavaay main ek dravyamaatr main samavet hone se dravya main or shabdaantar kaa kaaran hone se karm main antarbhaav kaa nishedh tathaa abhaav main bhavatmak shabd ke antarbhaav kii aprasakti se shesh bachane vaale gun main shabd ke antarbhaav kaa anumaan
 3
 Normative = The two substances in which the broad sense relation, such as desire, property and soul are not directly known, but when the direct known relationship is not directly known, but the general analogy of substances in general is the properties and substance
 The relation of the matter is well known, the desire is in the estimation of each other, the resemblance of the property in the form of matter and the substance in the soul
 The other will cause the more properties estimated true selves fluid as their shelter
 ukt teenon anumaanon main prayek ke teen bhed maane jate hai- "kevalanwai", "kevalavyatireki" or anvayavyatireki
 The basis of these distinctions is given by Raghunath Shiromani to Sadhya, Udayanacharya to Vyapatrahaka Sahyog and Gangeshopadhyay considered Vyapati
 raghunatha kaa taatpary yah he ki jis saadhy kaa vipaksh nahin hota us saadhy kaa anumaan "kevalanwai" anumaan kaha jaataa he, jaise vaachyatv, gyeyatv aadi saarvatrik dharmon kaa anumaan; evam jis saadhy kaa sapaksh nahin hota us saadhy kaa anumaan "keval vyatireki" anumaan kaha jaataa he, jaise gandh se pruthivi main pruthivitarbhed kaa anumaan; tathaa jis saadhy main sapaksh, vipaksh donon hote hai us saadhy kaa anumaan "anvayavyatireki" anumaan kaha jaataa he, jais gum se vahri kaa anumaan
 Udayanacharya means that "exploitation" = co-operation of purpose and "perennial co-operation" = co-operation of subjectivity in practice, both these synergies are knowledge of enlightenment and permission from the same, hence the permission of which the productive prevalence The rise of knowledge is only due to the knowledge of innovation, the reason for the permission "only", and the permission of which the productive philosophy is born only to the person
 The permission is due to the practice of "permission only" and the permission of which the productive prevalence of knowledge arises from the knowledge of both exploitation and perverse association is called "anonymity" inference
 gangashopadhyaay kaa abhipraay yah he ki anumiti kii utpatti keval anvayavyaptigyaan se hi nahin hoti, kintu vyatirekvyaptigyaan se bhi hoti he, at: jis anumiti kaa janm keval anvayavyaptigyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "kevalanwai", evam jis anumiti kaa janm keval vyatirekvyapti ke gyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "kevalavyatireki" tathaa jis anumiti kaa janm anvay or vyatirek donon vyaptiyon ke gyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "anvayavyatireki" anumaan kaha jaataa he
 The substance in which permissiveness arises from the knowledge of practicum and inclinations is called "for" or linga
 uske do bhed hote hai - "saddhetu" or hetvabhaas 
 The following five forms must be present in the Siddhetu: yahan ukt paanchon ke roopon se sampann hona keval anvayavyatireki saddhetu ke liye hi aavashyak he
 Kevalavayi Saddhetu requires "oppositionism" to be accomplished by an additional four forms
 hetvabhaas - jiske gyaan se anumiti uske karanbhoot vyaptigyaan yaa pakshadharmatagyaan kaa pratibandh hota he use - hetugat dosha arth main - "hetvabhaas" kaha jaataa he or ye dosha jin hetuon main hote hai unhen- "dusht hetu arth main"- "hetvabhaas" kaha jaataa he
 Five distinctions of the pertinent defect are considered
 nimnlikhit talika se yah samajha ja saktaa he ki ve bhed koun hai, unke dwaara kya pratibadhya hota he, tathaa unase yukt dusht hetuon ke kya naam hai? Due to permission - Three-time counseling for gender is the reason for permission
 "paksh hetu ke sambandh kaa gyaan" pratham ling paraamarsh kaha jaataa he- jaise parvat main dhooma ke sambandh kaa "parvato dhoomavan" is prakaar kaa gyaan
 "the knowledge of the prevalence of attainment in the" is called the second gender counseling - as in Dhoom, the "dhoomo Vahriya Vyapya" of Vravivyapati: "this kind of knowledge
 paksh main saadhyavyapya hetu ke sambandh kaa gyaan" tritiy yaa charam ling paraamarsh kaha jaataa he - jaise parvat main vahrivyapya dhooma ke sambandh kaa "parvato vahrivyapya dhoomavan" is prakaar kaa gyaan
 Discrimination - "discrimination" is also a reason for permission
 paksh main saadhy kaa nishchay rahane kii dasha main anumiti kii utpatti ko rokane ke liye ise anumiti kaa kaaran mana jaataa he
 The ancient Nyayikas have referred to the "sadhyasya", Udayanacharya the "permissive Desire", the affable Mishra as the "permissive-will" in the absence of the permissive will, and in the absence of it the "will of God" and Gangesopadhyay has given the "siddha-siddhivirishivistiddhivabhava" Is considered "favoritism"
 gangashopadhyaay kaa mantavya yah he ki jab paksh main saadhy siddhi hoti he or us saadhy ko anumaan se jaanane kii ichha nahin hoti, usee samay anumiti kii utpatti nahin hoti he; kintu saadhy ko anumaan se jaanane kii ichha hone par paksh main saadhyanishchay kii dasha main bhi anumiti kii utpatti hoti he
 There is no fixed requirement of practicableness or permissibility for that
 pratibandh kaa bhav - yah bhi anumiti kaa kaaran he
 It can be divided into four forms according to the following table
 in chaaron nishchayon se anumiti kaa pratibandh hota he; at: in chaaron nishchayon kaa abhaav "pratibandhkabhaav" ke rup main anumiti kaa kaaran hota he
 Vyapati - Vyapati knowledge has been said to be the reason for permission as second gender tradition
 is vyapti ke nirvachan main naiyayikon ne bada purusharth pradarshit kiya he; kyonk yahi anumaan ke pramantv kii aadharshila he
 The prevalence has been mainly considered to be of two types - "anvayavaypati" and "vyatirekavyapati"
 jis vyapti ke sharir main - saadhy main hetu vyaapkatv - pravesh ho use siddhanthabhat anvayavyapti kaha jaataa he - jaise "hetuvyapaksaadhyasaamanadhikarany"
 And the coverage in which the body - in the sense of being - is known as "vyatirekavya vyapti" - is a "sadhyabhavya vyakbhava competition"
 anvayavyapti kaa taatpary yah he ki hetu kaa aise saadhy ke aashray main rahanaa, jiskaa hetu ke kisi aashray main abhaav na ho
 And the meaning of contrast is that of having a sense of belonging in the shelters of meditation
 jaise - dhoomaketu kisi aashray main vahri kaa abhaav na hone se vahri dhooma kaa vyapak he or us vahri ke aashray mahanas aadi main dhooma rahata he; isi prakaar vahnybhav ke aashrayon main dhooma kaa abhaav rahata he; isliye dhooma main vahni kii "anvay" or "vyatirek" donon vyaptiyaan rahati hai
 Measures of Vyaptigāna - Three practitioners of Vyātigāna are considered - "ignorance of adultery," "knowledge of Sadhvachar or Hettabhavāsākha in practice" and "logic"
 inamen pratham do vyaptigyaan ke saarvatrik saadhan hai; par tark sarvatra nahin kvachit hi apekshit hota he
 As Vishwanath has said in the epics of his treatise called Bhasha Parivatha: tark - gautam ne tark kaa lakshan kaha he : 
 parvarti navy naiyayikon ne tark kaa lakshan is prakaar kiya he : "vyapya ke aharya aarope se vyapak kaa jo aharya aarope hota he" vah "tark" he
 This logic is considered to be a derivative of its purity in the contrary conjecture, ie, the lack of extensive consumer exposure due to the lack of comprehensive competition
 jab kabhi hetu main saadhy vyabhichaar kii shankaa hone se vyaptigyaan kaa pratibandh hone lagata he, us shankaa ko tark dwaara nirast kar vyaptigyaan kaa path prashast kar diya jaataa he
 Just as the knowledge of the support of the housewife in the pompous Dhoom, even when there is a suspicion of adultery in the mountain Dhoom, "logic" is used to overcome it
 jaise - "kisi bhi dhooma main yadi vahri kaa vyabhichaar hoga to vahri dhooma kaa kaaran na ho sakegaa or yah sambhav nahin he ki vahri ko dhooma kaa kaaran na mana jaae; kyonki us dasha main dhooma ke sampadanarth vahri ke grahan main manushya kii niyat pravriti kaa lop ho jayega"
 As a result of this argument, it is concluded that "dhoom originates from the atmosphere and hence there is a lack of adultery" and after the conclusion, the knowledge of transnationalism in Dhoom is uninterrupted as the apprehension of adultery in the mountain Dhoom is concluded
 it happens
 uparyukt tarklakshak sutara kii vishwanathavritti main tark ke atmashray, anyonyashray, chakrak, anavastha or in chaaron se pruthak baadhitarthprasang, ye paanch bhed batala kar prayek kaa udhaaharan pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Degree - The one who lives in all the shelters of matter but does not live in all the shelters for it is called "title"
 oopaadhi ke teen bhed hote hai - shuddh saadhy kaa vyapak, pakshadharmasahit saadhy kaa vyapak tathaa sadhanyukt saadhy kaa vyapak
 Knowledge of the title is not a direct opponent of prevalence
 arthath hetu main saadhy vyapak oopaadhi ke vyabhichaar se usamen saadhy vyabhichaar kaa anubhav hota he or saadhy ke us anumanik vyabhichaargyan se vyaptigyaan kaa saakshaat pratibandh hota he
 The analogy of other substances in one substance is called "upaman" evidence
 isse arthvishesh main shabd vishesh ke shakti sambandh kaa gyaan hota he
 His process is as follows
 jab koi aranyavasi manushya kisi gramvasi manushya ko bataata he ki arany main tumhaari gau ke sadrush gavay naam kaa ek pashu hota he, jab tum arany main kabhi janaa to jis pashu ko apni gau ke sadrush dekhnaa use gavay samaj lenaa, tadnusaar jab gramvasi kabhi arany jaataa he or vahaan apni gau ke sadrush kisi pashu ko dekhtaa he use aranyavasi kii baat kaa samaran hota he or use falswaroop us pashu main use gavay shabd ke shaktsambandh kaa nishchay ho jaataa he
 In this way, the philosophy of Gosaduchya in Gaavya is called the Upamankruti, the memory of the meaning assigned by the Aranavasi, its business and the determination of the power of the word Gaavya in the Gaavya is called fruit
 udaynacharya ne yahi baat agrim karika main kahi he
 This topic is even more detailed in the advance works of Vishwanath Nyaypanchanan: ise bhi dekhen - aptpraman In which the experience of the substance is remembered by the knowledge of the power or characteristic relation of the substance, it is called "word proof"
 ghat shabd main ghatpadaarth ke shakti sambandh ke gyaan se ghat kaa samaran hokar ghat kaa anubhav or ganga shabd main gangatir ke lakshan sambandh ke gyaan se gangatir kaa samaran hokar gangatir kaa anubhav hone se ghat or gangatir rup arthon main ghat or ganga shabd pramaan hote hai
 The word so-called is a sign of such meaning, or it is interpreted by such-and-such word, this type of eternal God-sign is called Shakti
 jaise raja bhageerath ne kapil muni ke shaap se dugdh or apane purvaj saar suton ke uddhararth jis jalpravaah ko prithvi par pravartit kiya, us jalpravaah main ganga kaa anadi sanket us arth main ganga shabd kii shakti he
 In the sense, the modern sign of the word, which is a non-permanent sign, in that sense, the modern sign of that word is called "definition"
 jaise kisi nutan vastu ke liye uske nirmaataa dwaara nishchit kiya gaya koi naam
 The word's connotation is called "symptom"
 jaise- shabd ke shakyarth jalpravaah kaa tir ke saath sanyog sambandh
 When power cannot be realized by the power of a speaker with a word, by that symptom the belief of that meaning is completed
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar arth ke shakti or lakshan sambandh sanskrit bhashaa ke shuddh shabdon main hi ashrith hote hai, anya bhashaaon ke shabd nyaayashastra kii drushti main apshabd yaa apbhransh maane jate hai
 The word apabhramsa signifies the meaning when it is defined or it has the power of meaning
 shakti or lakshan se atirikt vyanjana naam kaa koi shabdaarth sambandh nyaayashastra main maanya nahin he
 Realization of the meaning for which such a third relationship is considered, the realization of it is done by symptoms, somewhere by knowledge symptoms, by mind, and sometimes by inference
 shabd pramaan ke do bhed hote hai- loukik or vaidic
 In these, the temporal terminology is considered to be evidence from the dialogue of other temporal proofs, but the Vedic terminology is also considered as proof without communicating any temporal proof
 vedamulak smritiyon ko loukik kaha jaae yaa vaidic, kintu unka pramantv veda ke samvaad par nirbhar hota he
 The word proof experience is called Shabdabodha
 vah padagyaan, pad-padaarth sambandh gyaan, padaarth samaran aakankshagyaan, aasakti yaa aasaktigyaan, yogyatagyaan yaa ayogyata nishchay kaa abhaav, taatparygyan yaa taatparygyapak prakaran in saat kaarnon se utpann hota he
 Experience and remembrance - Knowledge from the above four evidences is called experience
