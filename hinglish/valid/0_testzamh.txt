 In the original Puranas, due to the parts connected in time, the information given about them in Satavahanas is no longer reliable
 saath hi vibhinn puraanon main satvahanon ke sandarbh main martaky na hone ke kaaran sthiti ore bhi sandehaaspad ho gai he
 Although the Brihada Katha composed by Gunadhaya is believed to have been written under the patronage of the Satavahana kingdom, this work is no longer found in its original form and based on this, the information given in the later versions is different from different scholars
 isi prakaar leelavati jo ki satvaahan shaasha kaal ke sainik abhiyaanon evam vijayon se sambandhit he, par bhi adhik adhik vishwaas nahi kiya ja saktaa
 For this reason, our information about the Satavahana period is limited
 satvahanon ke abhyuday tathaa unke mul nivas sthaan ko le kar vibhinn vidwaanon main gaharaa matbhed he
 The Satavahana and Shatakarni rulers mentioned in the inscriptions and coins are called in the Puranas by the names of Andhra, Andhra-death and Andhra
 is aadhaar par vidwaan is nirnay par pahunche he ki satvaahan athwa shatakarani raja andhron ke samatuly the
 According to Rappson, Smith and Bhandarkar, Satavahana rulers were related to Andhra country

 He is mentioned in the Aitareya Brahmin as a caste that was free from the influence of the Aryans
 indica main magasthanij unki shakti evam samruddhi kaa ullekh kiya ha
 Ashoka's inscriptions describe him as one of the people who were under the influence of his empire
 parantu maury samrajya ke patan ke baad unka kya hua iskaa pataa nahi chalata
 Possibly, he had freed himself
 upar varnit itihaaskaar yadhyapi andhrapradesh ko satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan maanate he tathaapi unki shakti ke kendra ko lekar in vidwaanon main matbhed hai
 Where Smith considers Sri Kakulam as the capital of Satavahanas or Andhra
 parantu satvaahan ke andhron ke saath sambandh ko lekar vidwaanon main matbhed he
 In the inscriptions of the Samavahana dynasty, the rulers of this period are consistently called Satavahanas or Shatakarnis
 saahitiyik granthon main inke liye yadakada shaali vaahan shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But in this context, the word Andhra is not used in any inscription of this dynasty
 duusari ore shilalekhon, sikkon tathaa saahitiyik sroton ke aadhaar par pashchimi bharat ko inkaa mul nivas sthaan mana gaya he
 Evidence of this fact is also found in the early inscriptions of Nanaghat and Saanchi
 is aadhaar par dow gopalchaari ne pratishthan tathaa uske aasapaas ke kshetra ke satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan mana he
 In addition VS Sukuthankar to Bellary district; h c Rai Chaudhary has considered the southern part of the other country and VV Mirashi as the original abode of Satavahanas on both sides of the river Ganges
 is aadhaar par satvahanon tathaa andhron kaa samatuly evam sajaatiy hona sandehaaspad hi he
 In this subject scholars have suggested that the Satavahanas started their early life in the Deccan and conquered Andhra Pradesh in a short time
 kaalaantar main jab shaq tathaa amir akramanon ke kaaran satvaahan samrajya ke pashchimi tathaa uttari kshetra unke haathon se jate rahe tab kadaachit unki shakti godavari tathaa krishna nadi ke madhya kshetra arthath andhra pradesh tak simit ho gai tathaa ab satvahanon ko andhron ke naam se janaa jane laga
 We do not even know about the origin of Satavahanas
 kuch vidwaanon ne unki tulana ashok ke shilalekhon main varnit satiyaputronse tathaa kuch ne plini dwaara varnit setai se kii he
 Some other scholars have defined the words Shatakarni and Satavahana on the basis of the term Bhasha Vigyan, irrespective of the importance of these words, but based on the inscriptions of the Satavahana dynasty it is almost certain that the Satavahanas were also Brahmins like the Sunga and Kanva rulers
 
 is baat kaa pramaan nasik shilaalekh se bhi mil jaataa he jisamen gautami putr shri shatakarni ko ek brahman tathaa khatiya-dap-maan-madan arthath kshatriyon kaa maan mardan karne vaala aadi oopaadhiyon se sushebhit kiya he
 The author of this inscription has compared Gautamiputra to Parasurama
 saath hi datrishatputalika main bhi shalivahanon ko mishrit brahman jati tathaa nagajati se utpann mana gaya he
 There are deep differences among scholars regarding the chronology of the Satavahanas
 aitreyay brahman jo ki paanch sau i0purv main likhaa gaya tha usamen andhron ko aise dasyu bataaya gaya he jo ki arya paridhi se baahar the tathaa jo vishwamitra ke vanshaj the
 On this basis, Dr
 DR Bhandarkar has considered the beginning of the Satavahanas as early as 500 BC
 dovi0e0 smith ke anusaar andhra pehle adhinsth the parantu uski mrityu ke pashchaat ve simukh ke netritv main swatantra ho gaye tathaa yah ghatana teesri shatabdi i0purv main hui
 In this subject, Smith has considered the basis of Puranas according to which a total of thirty rulers of Andhra ruled for about 460 years
 dogopalchaari ne bhi is tathy ko sweekaarte hue yah mana he ki satvaahan vansh kii sthapana lagbhag 235i0purv tathaa uskaa patan lagbhag 255 isvi main hua
 On the basis of the inscription of elephant elephants during the reign of Kharkhel, the ruler of Kalinga, Rappson believes the beginning of the Satavahana dynasty between 220 BCE and 211 AD, but there is a difference in various Puranas regarding the Yasan period of the Satavahanas
 ek ore jaha matsaypurana unka kul yasana kaal 460varsh bataata he vahiin duusari ore brahmanpurana main yah avadhi 456 varsh bataai gai he
 According to the Vayupurana, the Satavahanas ruled for 411 years while Vishnupuran considers their reign as 300 years
 duusari aar dow aar0 ji0 bhandarkar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana 72
73 i0purv ko maanate hai
 On the basis of a statement mentioned in the Puranas, he has believed that the "shunga Miryatya" Kanva rulers were the servants of the Shunga rulers and ruled alongside them like the Peshwas and the founder of the Satavahana dynasty named Simuk or Shishuka ruled the Kanva king
 After killing Sushraman, he killed both the Kanva and Shung dynasties and subjugated his empire
 parantu yah tathy avishwasaneey he kyoking ham yah bhalee-bhaanti jaanate he ki shunga tathaa kanv vansh ke shaskaon ne kabhi sanyukt rup se shashan nahi kiya tathaa kanv vansh ke sansthaapak vasudev kanv ne antim shunga shaasha devbhuti kii hatya kar shashan kii bagdor sambhaali thi
 The statement of Vayu Purana on the basis of which Dr Bhandarkar has misinterpreted, is rightly defined by Dr Rai Chaudhary
 unke anusaar yah gandyash maatra itnaa hi bataata he ki simuk ne jab kanv vansh kaa ant kar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana kii to usne un shunga upashaskaon bhi samaapt kar diya jo ki kanv vansh ke haathon shunga shaskaon ke parajeet hone ke baad bhi bache rah gaye the
 Hence, Satavahana rulers took over the reins of their rule by ending the Kanva dynasty in 29 BC
 parantu is sab karkon ke hote hue bhi is sambhaavna se inkaar nahi kiya ja saktaa ki simuk jisane 23varshon tak shashan kiya vah kuch samay pehle hi arthath pehali shatabdi i0pus0 ke madhya main hi singhasanarudh ho gaya hoga
 Simuk was the founder of the Satavahana dynasty and ruled for almost 23 years from 235 BC to 212 BC
 yadhyapi uske vishay main hamen adhik jaankaree nahi milti tathaapi puraanon se hamen yah gyaat hota he ki kanv shaskaon kii shakti kaa naash kar tathaa bache hue shunga mukhiyaaon kaa daman karke usne satvaahan vansh kii neenv rakhi
 In the Puranas, in addition to Symek, he is also called Shishuk, Sindhuk and Shiprak etc
 jain anushrutiyon ke anusaar simuk ne apane shashan kaal main jain tathaa buddha mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaaya, parantu apane shashan kaal ke antkaal main vah pathbhrasht tathaa croor ho gaya jis karanvash use padchyut kar uski hatya kar di
 After Simuk's death, his younger brother Kanha ascended the throne
 apane 18 varshon ke kaarykaal main kanha ne samrajya visataar kii niti ko apanaaya
 The inscription of Nashik suggests that the Satavahana empire spread west to Nashik in the time of Kanha
 shatakarni-p kanha ke uparant shatakarni pratham gaddi par baitha
 According to the Puranas, he was the son of Kanha
 parantu dow gopalchaari simuk ko shatakarni pratham kaa pita maanate hai
 Some scholars have believed that its rule lasted for two years, but Neelkanth Shastri has considered his reign from 194 BC to 185 BC
 jo bhi ho yah suspasht he ki uskaa shashan kaal bahut lambaa nahi tha
 But despite being short, the tenure of Shatkarni i is more important from some perspectives
 satvaahan shaskaon main vah pehla tha jisane is vansh ke shaskaon main priy evam prachlit, ‘‘shatakarni’’ shabd se apana namakaran kiya
 According to the Nanaghat inscription, Shatkarni expanded his empire and performed two Ashwamedha Yajna and one Rajasuya Yajna during his work
 uski rani nayanika ke ek shilaalekh se hamen yah gyaat hota he ki shatakarni pratham ne pashchimi malwa ke saath-saath anup tathaa vidarbha pradeshon bhi jeet liya
 If Shatkarni i is the only ruler mentioned in the archway of the Sanchi Stupa, it also proves that in his time central India was under the authority of the Satavahanas
 vah apane chhate se kaary kaal me samraat ban gaya tathaa usne dakshin pathpati tathaa apratihat chakra aadi oopaadhiyaan dhaaran kii
 It is suggested on the basis of the similarity of the script used in the Nanaghat article and the Elephant Gumpha writings, that perhaps in the second year of the reign of this Shatkarni rulers, the great ruler of Kalinga, Kharkhel was defeated in the battle field
 shatakarni pratham kii patni nayanika athwa naganika angeey kul ke ek maharathi trankairo kii putree thi
 After the death of Shatkarni I, his two minor sons Vedashree and Satashri sat on the throne
 parantu alpavyask hone ke kaaran prashasan kii sari bagdor unki maa nayanika ke haathon main aa gai jisane apane pita kii sahaayta se shashan chalaaya
 It seems that Vedashree died at a young age and Satshri took over as his successor
 parantu puraana is vishay main ekamat he ki shatakarni pratham ke pashchaat purnotsang naamak raja satvaahan singhaasana par asin hua
 Regardless of the name of the fourth Satavahana ruler, it is certain that it was during the reign of this ruler that Pushyamitra Sunga conquered the last Mauryan ruler Brahadratha and took over the kingdom of Magadha
 matsaypurana main skandastambhi kaa ullekh satvaahan vansh ke paanchaven shaasha ke rup main keya he parantu adhiktar vidwaan is naam ko kalpit maanate hai
 Shatkarni II ruled from about 166 BC to 111 BC
 yah kadaachit vahi shaasha tha jiskaa varnan hithigumpha tathaa bhilsa shilalekhon main hua he
 It seems that during its reign, the Satavahanas snatched eastern Malwa from a successor of Pushyamitra Sunga
 puraanon ke anusaar shatakarni dwitiya ke pashchaat lambodar rajsinghaasana par asin hua
 After Lambodar, his son Appellant ascended the throne
 apilak jo ki aathvaan satvaahan shaasha tha, in donaan ke madhya kaa kaal satvahanon ke sandarbh main andhkaar yug mana gaya he jisamen keval kuntal shatakarni ke kaal ko hi apwaad mana ja saktaa he
 Kuntal Shatkarni was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas after the appellant
 kamasutra main vatsayan ne kuntal shatakarni kaa ullekh karte hue likhaa he ki usne apni ungaliyon ko kanchi ke rup main prayog kiya tathaa iske prahaar se uski pataraani malayavati kii mrityu ho gai
 In Kavyamamsha, Rajeshwar describes Kuntal Shatkarni as saying that he had ordered his queens living in his Raniwas to use only Prakrit language
 haal satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatpurna shaasha tha
 Although he ruled only four years, his reign was very important in some subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yadi aarmabhik satvaahan shaskaon main shatakarni pratham yoddha ke rup main sabase mahaan tha to haal shantidoot ke rup main agrani tha
 Hall also had a literary interest and became famous as a poet emperor

 It is believed that Saptashati or Satsai was written recently in the Prakrit language
 brihadakatha ke lekhak gunanty bhi haal kaa samakaleen tha tathaa kadaachit pashachi bhashaa main likhi is pustak kii rachana usne haal hi ke sangrakshan main kii thi
 In Kalantar, the three books named Buddhavami's Brihakatha-'ilok-sangra ', Kshemendra's brihadatha-manjari and Somdev's Kathasaritasagar originated from the Briha story of Gunadhya
 haal ke pradhan senapati vijayanand ne apane swami ke aadeshaanusaar srilanka par akraman kar use jeet liya
 While returning from this conquest, he stopped for some time at a place called Sapta Godavari Bhimam
 vahaan vijayanand ne srilanka ke raja kii ati rupavaan putree leelavati kii charchaa suni jiskaa varnan usne apane raja haal se kiya
 Hall tried to marry Lilavati
 kivdanti he ki haal ne purvi dakkan main kuch sainik abhiyaan kiye parantu saakshyon ke abhaav main adhiktar vidwaan ise galat maanate hai
 However, in the recent reign of Satavahana rulers, in addition to the political field, there was a lot of development in literary and economic areas as well as the development of trade and commerce cities and the advancement of water transport which during the reign of second Mundlak or Puridransen in the first century AD
 Reached its culmination, however, for about fifty years to come proved very difficult for the Satavahana Empire Happened
 aisa prathit hua maano ke pashchim kshatrapon ke rup main hue videshi akraman ke saath hi satvaahan samrajya kaa patan hone ko he
 The Kushans were spreading in the north-west and under their pressure, the Shaka and Pahlav rulers were eager to fight with the Satavahanas, attracted towards central and western India
 kshahraat vansh ke pashchimi kshatrapon ne apane ko pashchima raajputana, gujarat tathaa kathiyawad main sthapit kar liya tha
 These Shaka rulers attacked the Satavahana kingdom from 35 AD to about 90 AD
 unhone satvahanon se purvi tathaa payichama malwa pradeshon ko jeeta; uttari konkan uttari maharashtra, jo ki satvaahan shakti kaa kendra tha tathaa banavaasi tak faile dakshini maharashtra par bhi apana prabhutv jamaa liya
 The first ruler of the Kshatra dynasty was Ghoomak whose sources of information are some coins which have been found mostly from the coastal region of Gujarat Kathiawar and Yadakada Malwa
 ghumak kaa uttaradhikari nahpaan tha jisaki jaankaree hamen uske bahusankhya sikkon par raja kii oopaadhi dhaaran kii he
 At the same time, inscriptions got his titles Kshatrap and Mahakshatrap

 Nahapan and his Jamaat Shaka Ashwadat unleashed the Satavahana power in the western Deccan by conquering Malwa, the Narmada Valley, northern Konkan, the western part of Berar and and southern Maharashtra
 ve satvaahan raja jo nahpaan ke haathon parajeet hue kadaachit sundar shatakarni, chakor shatakarni tathaa shivsaati the jinka ki kaarykaal bahut hi chota tha parantu yah paristhitiyaan adhik samay tak nahi chali tathaa gautami putr shri shatakarni ke satvaahan shaasha banate hi is kshahraat-satvaahan sangharsh main nayaa mode aayaa
 After nearly half a century of turmoil and honor at the hands of the Shaka rulers, Gautami reestablished his lost reputation under the leadership of son Shatkarni
 gautami putr shri shatakarni satvaahan vansh kaa sabase mahaan shaasha tha jisane lagbhag 25 varshon tak shashan karte hue na keval apane samrajya kii khoi pratishtha ko purnsthapit kiya apitu ek vishaal samrajya kii bhi sthapana kii
 In the time of Gautami's son and his victories, we get complete information from the Nashik inscriptions of his mother Gautami Balashree
 kuch visheshgyon dwaara gautamiputra satkarni ko raja shalivahan bhi mana jaataa he
 He united the whole of India and defended against foreign invaders
 uske sandarbh main hamen is lekh se yah jaankaree milti he ki usne kshatriyon ke ahankaar kaa maan-mardan kiya
 He is described as the doer of Saka, Yavan and Pahlav Sasakas
 uski sabase badi uplabdhi kshahraat vansh ke shaq shaasha nahpaan tathaa uske vanshajon kii uske haathon hui paraajay thi
 The silver coins of Nahapan obtained from the Jogalthambi group which Gautami's son Shatkarni reintroduced and in the eighteenth year of his reign, by Gautami's son making a cavity at Pandu-lan near Nashik - these are some of the facts that prove that he Rejuvenated the territories taken away by the Shaka rulers
 nahpaan ke saath unka yuddh uske shashan kaal ke 17wein or 18wein varsh main hua tathaa is yuddh main jeet kar rgatmi putr ne aparant, anup, saurashtra, cooker, akar tathaa avanti ko nahpaan se chin liya
 Apart from these areas, Gautami's son also had dominion over Rishik, Ayamak, Moolak and Vidarbha etc
 uske pratyaksh prabhaav main rahane vaala kshetra uttar main malwa tathaa kathiyawad se lekar dakshin main krishna nadi tak tathaa puvai main baraar se lekar pashchim main konkan tak failaa hua tha
 He assumed the title 'tri-sea-toy-yellow-vehicle', indicating that his influence was in the eastern, western and southern seas, that is, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean
 aisa prathit hota he ki apni mrityu ke kuch samay pehle gautami putr shatakarni dwaara nahpaan ko haraakar jite gaye kshetra uske haath se nikal gaye
 Those who snatched these territories from Gautami's son were probably the Shaka rulers of the Kardamak dynasty of the Scythian race
 iskaa pramaan hamen talami dwaara bhugol kaa varnan karti uski pustak se miltaa he
 a similar conclusion can also be drawn from the famous Rudradaman inscription of Junagadh of 150 AD
 yah shilaalekh darshata he ki nahpaan se vijit gautamiputra shatakarni ke sabhi pradeshon ko usase rudradaman ne hathiyaa liya
 It appears that Gautamiputra Shatkarni attempted to secure his territories captured by Rudradaman by establishing matrimonial relations with the Kardamak Shakas

 Haibun is a prose genre in Japanese literature
 isamen padya or gadhy donon hi vidhao kaa samavesh hota hai
 Haibun is a combination of short prose and haiku written as a travelogue
 matsuo basho, jo ek sant or hiku kavi the, is lekhan style ke armbh karta hai
 He wrote many Haibun in his travels
 samakaleen hibun kaa prayog va unki rachana abhi viksit ho rahi he
 Normally a Haibun consists of one or two paragraphs and one or two embedded haiku
 gadhy kaa bhaag aamtaur par pehle likhaa jaataa he or sankshipt hota he
 In it, a scene or a particular moment is described very descriptively
 uske saath jude hiku kaa gadhy se sidhaa sambandh hota he arthath vah gadhy ke bhavarth ko puri tarah se gher letaa he or us us anubhav kaa ek aalekh prastut karata he
 By reading together the opposite expressions of prose and haiku, the reader experiences a greater effect or depth that cannot be attained by reading only prose or only haiku
 yah aavashyak he ki kuch bhi sidhi tarah nahin kaha janaa chaiye balki us pal kaa ek chitra ankit kar padhane vaale ke saamne is tarah rakhaa jaye ki vah apni kalpana se lekhak ke anubhav ko samaj sake
 The present tense, the shortness of prose and the use of syntax in fewer words are preferred in the creation of modern Haibun
 hibun kaa lekhak saamanyata kaa parihaar karte hue drishy ko asampruktata se chitrit karata he
 Prose can be part of a diary
 parantu bahut saavdhaanee va dekh-rekh se ise kai baar padhakar dekhnaa chahie
 In a perfect haibun, the prose portion will not reveal anything about haiku but haiku will promote the defining moment of that experience
 hiku gadhy ke saath tirachha sambandh rakhte hue gadhy main prayog kiye sangya, kriya, visheshan or karm kaa parihaar karata he
 a Haibun by Dr
 Anjali Deodhar, “yah to bahut bura hua

 In the last few years, many innocent people have been killed by the guards
 In 2016, after the beating of innocent Dalits by the guards, the Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi criticized the violence by Gorakshas
 But even after this, the guards continued their disturbance
 goraksha ke naam par gundon ne chande or fund jutakar goshaalaayein khol lee hai | adhiktar gorakshak shaakaahaari hote hai, or daawa karte hai ki maansaahaari aahaar logon ko hinsak bana detaa he, parantu vidmbana yah ki ve swayan hinsak he | ve raat main sadakon par vaahanon kii talaashi lete hai or vaahanchaalkon ko peetate-maarthe hai | kabhi-kabhi ve peediton ko gobar or gomutra kaa panchgavy banaakar khilaa dete hai, kabhi kode maarthe hai, or yahaan tak kii hatya bhi kar dete hai | There has also been a debate in the Indian Parliament regarding the nuisance of the guards
 Politicians of the opposition have accused the BJP government of encouraging cow protection goons
 For example, in Haryana, the BJP government has created a 24-hour cow protection helpline, and has put check posts on the roads for cow protection
 The opposition alleges that the BJP is focused on fake cow protection, except issues like women's defense and farmer welfare, while the money allocated for real cow protection is being misused
 For example, in Hingonia Gaushala in Rajasthan, a four to five-foot cow dung formed, and within fifteen days one thousand cows died

 a few days after Prime Minister Shri Modi's statement, in Patiala, the head of the security guard Satish Kumar was arrested on charges of unnatural sexual exploitation and other criminal activities
 But the guards guarded the Prime Minister, and accused him of being secular
 The guards accused Modi of stabbing her on the back, saying that 'narendra Modi's mentality is still chaiwala'
 ' akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha ne to pradhanmantri narendra modi ko gambhir parinaam bhugatne kii dhamkee di | vishwa hindu parishad ne pradhanmantri modi ke is bayaan ko gorakshakon ko apmaan bataaya, or kaha ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko iskaa parinaam bhugatna padegaa
 Regarding the atrocities on Dalits in Una, Prime Minister Shri Modi told the Gorakshas, 'if you want to kill, shoot me and stop the attack on Dalits'
 But the guards ignored this advice of the Prime Minister, and a few days later, in Andhra Pradesh, Dalits were severely beaten on the charge of stripping the dead

 Cryptography, or cryptology, is derived from the Greek word κρυπτός, cryptos and γράφω grapho or -λογία, lojia
 inke arth hai kramshah chupa hua rahasy or main likhata hoon
 It is the process of studying any hidden information
 aadhunik samay main, kryptographi yaa kuta-lekhan ko ganit or computer vigyaan donon kii ek shakha mana jaataa he or soochna siddhant, computer suraksha or ejineering se kaafii zyada judaa hua he
 Encoding applications exist in many forms in technologically advanced societies
 udhaaharan ke liye - atm card, computer password or electronic vaanijya - ye sabhi kutalekhan par nirbhar karte hai
 Until modern times, cryptography was often referred to simply as the process of encryption or encoding, meaning the process of converting ordinary information) into an obscure or barely understood medium

 They were used without any additional processes such as authentication or integrity checks
 bolchaal kii bhashaa main "code yaa kuta " shabd kaa upyog aksar ancripshan kii kisi bhi vidhi ke arth main yaa arth ko chupaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 However, code or code has a more specific meaning in cryptography or cryptography; It means the replacement of a unit of common text with a code word
 kuta kaa upyog ab gambhir kutalekhan main nahin kiya jaataa he-ikai padon ke rup main aisi chizon ke liye sanyogvash hone vaale apwaadon ke alaava
 - Because properly selected ciphers are more practical and more secure than the best codes and are more receptive to computers

 clasical sifer ke dwaara utpann sifer text hameshaa plane text ke bare main sankhyikeey soochna prakat karte hai, jiskaa upyog aksar unhen todane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In the 9th century, almost all such ciphers became more or less brittle by a known attacker after the discovery of frequency analysis by the Arab mathematician Polymath, Al Kindi
 is tarah ke clasical sifer abhi bhi lokapriy hai, haalaanki adhikansh paheli ke rup main hai ) multah sabhi sifer kript analysis ke liye kamjor bane rahe, jab tak 1467 main leon battista alberty ne spasht rup se poli alpha betic gughalekh kaa vikaas nahin kiya haalaanki is baat kaa sanket he ki yah pracheen arab ganitagya jaise al-kindi ke liye gyaat tha
 Alberti's new technology used different ciphers for different parts of the message, he also discovered perhaps the first automatic cipher device, a wheel that executes the partial sensation of his invention
 bahu varni vigener sifer main encripshan ek kunjee shabd kaa prayog karata he, jo us varna pratisthaapan ko niyantrit karata he jis ke aadhaar par kunjee shabd ke varna kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Babbage in the mid-1800s demonstrated that these types of multi-cipher ciphers are partially vulnerable to detailed frequency analysis techniques
 haalaanki aavriti vishleshan kai cifron ke viruddh ek shaktishaalee or saamaanya takanic he, fir bhi encripshan praayogic rup se prabhaavshaalee tha; kai bhavi encripshan vigyaani is takanic se agyaat the
 Breaking a message without using frequency analysis was essential knowledge for the cipher used, and perhaps also for the key involved in the action
 is prakaar jasusi, rishwatakhori, chori, dharmatyag aadi adhik aakarshak drushtikon ban gaye
 In the 19th century it was finally recognized that the secrecy of the cipher's algorithm is not a sensing modality or practical protection; In fact it was later felt that the appropriate cryptographic scheme should be preserved even if the adversary fully understood the cipher algorithm

 This basic principle was first clearly established in 1883 by Auguste Karkhof and commonly known as the Karkhof theory; Alternatively and more explicitly it was re-established by Claude Shennon, inventor of the basic laws of information theory and theoretical cryptography, he also gave 'the Enemy Knows the System' as Shennon's Maxim

 In a 1976 ground-breaking paper Whitefield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public key cryptography
 jisamen do alag lekin ganitiya rup se sambandhit kusiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; ek saarvajanik kunjee or nijee kunjee
 The public key is constructed in such a way that the computation of one key is impractical from another
 fir bhi ve aavashyak rup se sambandhit hai
 Instead, the two keys are generated secretly, as an unrelated pair

 Digital signatures can be permanently tied to the component of the message being signed; Then they cannot be sent from one document to another for any effort
 digital hastakshar yojanaon main, do elgoritham hote hai; ek hastakshar ke liye jisamen sandesh par kaarywahi karne ke liye ek gupt kunjee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or doosraa satyaapan, ke liye jisamen hastakshar kii vaidyata kii jaanch karne ke liye sandesh ke saath ek saarvajanik milan kunjee prayukt kii jaati he
 RSA and DSA are the two most popular digital signature schemes
 digital hastakshar saarvajanik kunjee buniyadi sanrachana kii gatividhi ke liye or kai network suraksha yojanaon kai ve pi en aadi) ke liye kendriya hote hai
 Public key algorithms are mostly based on the computational complexity of problems from "difficult" problems, often number theory

 Due to the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public key algorithms involve activities such as modular multiplication and optimization
 jo adhikansh block sifers vishesh rup se praroopik kunjee aakaar se yukt block sifers main prayukt takneekon kii tulana main compyutational rup se adhik manhage hote hai
 As a result, public key crypto systems are usually hybrid crypto systems, in which a rapid high-quality symmetric key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the corresponding symmetric key is sent along with the message, but the public key algorithm It is encrypted using

 The purpose of cryptanalysis is to detect any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a cryptographic scheme

 It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken
 cloude shannon ne bel leboratories main unke dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke kaary ke sambandh main sabit kiya ki ek samay pad sifer bhangur nahin he, unhone bataaya ki mul padaarth yadrichhik hote hai or fir se kabhi bhi kaam main nahin liye ja sakate hai or bataaya ki isamen sabhi sambhav hamalavar hote hai or inaki lambaai sandesh ke baraabar yaa usase adhik hoti he
 Most ciphers other than a time pad, can be broken by a substantial computational effort by brute force attack, but the amount of effort required may exponentially depend on the size of the key, compared to the effort required to use the cipher, such In that case, effective protection can be achieved if it is proved that the effort required is beyond the capacity of any opponent
 arthath, yah darshaya janaa chahie ki sifer ko todane ke liye koi prabhavi vidhiyaan nahin khoji ja sakati he
 Since no such demonstrations are currently conducted, the one-time tree is the only theoretically unbreakable cipher in today's time
 kriptanalisis hamalon kii kai kismein hai or inhen kai tareekon se vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 a general distinction is made based on what an attacker knows and what capabilities are available
 sifer text ekmaatr hamale main, krypto vishleshak ke liye keval sifer text uplabdh hota he
 In, the cipher text and its associated plane text are available to the crypt analyzer
 In a selected plane text attack, the crypt analyzer selects a plane text and studies the cipher text associated with it; An example of this is gardening used by the British during World War II
 antat ek chaynit sifer text hamale main kript vishleshak sifer text ke chayan or isse sambandhit plane text kaa adhyayan karne main sakasham hota he
 Also often such mistakes occur in the use or design of one; For some historical examples, see Enigma's Cryptanalysis) samamit kunjee sifer ke kript analysis main praroopik rup se shaamil he stream sifer yaa block sifer ke viruddh hamalon kii khoj karnaa
 It is more effective than any attack against a skilled cipher
 udhaaharan ke liye, di i es ke viruddh ek saadhaaran broot force hamale ko ek gyaat plane text or 2 55 dikripshan kii zarurat hoti he, yah us bindu par pahunchne ke liye lagbhag aadhi sambhav kunjiyon par prayaas karata he jahaan behatar sambhaavnaaen hoti hai
 But this does not give sufficient assurance; a linear crypt analysis against DES requires 2 43 known plane text and approximately 2 43 DES activities
 yah broot force hamalon par ek acha sudhaar he
 Public key algorithms are based on the computational complexity of different problems
 inamen se sabase prasiddh he purnank gunan khand 
 But discrete logarithm problems are also very important
 adhikansh saarvajanik kunjee kript vishleshan, in computesnal samasyaon, yaa unamem se kuch ko prabhavi rup se sulajhane ke liye sankhyikeey elgoritham kaa upyog karte hai
 
 udhaaharan ke liye, asatat laghuganak ke dirghavrittiya vakr aadhaarit sanskaran ko hal karne ke liye sarvottam gyaat elgoritham bahut adhik samay lete hai, isaki tulana main gunan khand ke liye sarvottam gyaat elgoritham saamaan aakaar kii samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye kam samay lete hai
 In this way, encryption techniques based on multiplication blocks should use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques in order to achieve the equivalent resistance to resistance to attack
 isi kaaran se, dirghavrittiya vakr par aadhaarit saarvajanik kunjee krypto pranali 1990 ke madhya main hui khoj se bahut lokapriy ho gayi he
 When pure cryptanalysis uses a weakness of the algorithm, other attacks on the crypto system are based on the use of algorithms in real devices and are called side chain attacks
 yadi ek kript vishleshak ke liye samay kii maatra uplabdh he or upkaran ne plane text kii ek sankhya ko encript kiya, yaa usne ek password yaa pin kerector main kisi truti kaa pataa lagaaya, to vah ek sifer ko todane ke liye ek timming atek kaa upyog kar saktaa he, jo vishleshan ke liye pratirodhi he
 An attacker can also study the length and pattern of the message to obtain important information; This is called traffic analysis, and can be very useful for a warning conflict

 Most theoretical work in cryptography is based on cryptographic primitives and -; Of algorithms with basic cryptographic properties; And uses their relationship to other cryptographic problems
 iske baad adhik jatil kryptographic upkaran in mul primitivs se banate hai
 These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used in the development of more complex devices called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols
 jo ek yaa adhik ucch stareey suraksha lakshanon kii guarantee dete hai
 Note that although the distinction between cryptographic primitives and crypto systems is not definitive; For example, the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a crypto system and sometimes a primitive
 kryptographic primitive ke praroopik udaahranon main shaamil hai kuta yadrichhik function, ek taraf kaa function aadi
 One or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, this is called a cryptographic system or crypto system

 The crypto system uses the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the security features of the system
 beshak, chunki primitive or krypto system ke bich kaa vibhedan nishchit nahin he, kai or primitive krypto system ke sangyojan se ek parishkrut krypto system vyutpann kiya ja saktaa he
 In many cases, the structure of a crypto system consists of communication between two or more parties in place or over time) data
 aise kryptosystem kabhi kabhi krypto graphic protocol kehalaate hai
 Some widely known crypto systems are RSA encryption, Shanor signature, EL gamal encryption, PGP, etc

 Until recently, most of the security features of most crypto systems have been demonstrated using empirical techniques

 Accordingly, there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography, particularly since the advent of cheap computers, the availability of high quality cryptography has increased
 kuch deshon main, yahan tak ki kryptographi kaa gharelu upyog yaa to pratibandhit he yaa kar diya gaya he
 By 1999, France significantly prohibited the domestic use of cryptography, although it granted concessions to many of them
 china main, kryptographi kaa upyog karne ke liye abhi bhi ek license jaruri he
 There are strict restrictions on the use of cryptography in many countries
 belarus,kazakhstan, mongolia, pakistan, rus, singapore, tunisia or vietnamme adhik pratibandhit kanoon hai
 In the United States, cryptography is legal for home use, but there are many differences on legal issues related to cryptography

 Many Western countries have strictly regulated the export of cryptography in some places, possibly due to the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for continued national security

 These browsers and e-mail programs are such that even the government, whose job it is to control the public use of cryptography, generally does not do practically much to control the use or distribution of this quality of cryptography, so when Such regulations are enforced, when actual enforcement is effectively impossible

 Ammeter or 'ammometer' is a device used to measure the current flowing in a branch of a circuit
 bahut kam maatra vaali dhaaraon ko maapne ke liye prayukt yuktiyonko "milliametre" yaa "micrometre" kehete hai
 The earliest design of Ammeter was the d'arsonle's Dharmapi or the moving horoscope Dharmapi
 san 1820 i
 main ampiore ne avishkaar kiya ki yadi kisi chaalak ko, jisamen vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae, to usapar ek bal kaary karata he
 The value of this force is equal to the product of the intensity of the magnetic field, the current and the length of the conductor
 is bal kii disha fleming ke baayein haath vaale niyam se gyaat kii jaati he
 Spread the thumb of your left hand, the finger near it and the middle finger of the middle in such a way that all three are perpendicular to each other
 yadi tarjani chumbakeey kshetra kii disha main or madhyamaa vidyutdhara kii disha main sanket karen, to chaalak kii gati anguthe kii disha main hogi
 When electric current flows in a coil placed in a magnetic field, a coaxial force acts on the coil, which it begins to rotate
 is siddhant ko kaam main laakar jo dharamapi banaae gaye, hai unhen chalkundal dharamapi kehete hai
 It consists of a rectangular coil with thin and electrified copper wire
 yah kundali phasphar branj kii bahut patali pattee dwaara ek pench se lataki rahati he, kundali kaa ek sira isi pattee se judaa rahata he or pattee kaa sambandh dharamapi ke e sanyojak pench se hota he
 The leaf also has a circular plane or concave mirror, which rotates along the leaf
 kundali kaa doosraa sira dhaatu kii ek sarpil kamaani se judaa rahata he, jiskaa sambandh duusare sanyojak pench se hota he
 This coil hangs between the poles of a powerful permanent umbilical magnet
 chumbak ke dhruv natodar belanaakaar akruti main kate rahete hai
 a soft iron small cylinder is enclosed in the back of the Dharmapi by a screw inside the coil between the two pole segments
 ye sab vastuen ek achumbakeey baks main band rakhi jaati hai
 Glass is placed in the front of the box, so that the mirror can be measured by deflection lamp and scale method
 jab kundali main vidyut dhara pravaahit hoti he, tab kundali ke do bhujaaon par balyugma kaary karata he or kundali ko uski sthiravastha se ghuma detaa he, jisase phosphor branj kii pattee or neeche kii sarpil kamaani main anthan aa jaati he or e anthan bal yugma kundali par vipareet disha main kaary karne lagata he
 Due to which the horoscope is soon in balance
 yadi kundali kaa vikshep kone tha ho, to dharaman nimna sutara se nikalataa he : That is, the current is proportional to the deflection angle
 ye dharamapi atyant sthaayee or yathesht sugranhak hote hai
 They can measure current up to 10 amperes
 chalkundal dharamapi mukhyatya do prakaar ke hote hai : In this, the coil is wrapped on a metal structure, which causes the coil to deflect quickly as the current flows
 jaise hi kundali gumti he, usamen or uske dhaatu ke dhaanche main bhavar dharaayen utpann hoti hai or kundali ko roak detii hai
 The horoscope does not oscillate, this is why this instrument is called dead-pulse
 dhara ke hatate hi kundali apni purv sthiti main pahunch jaati he
 Therefore, the value of the current can be determined very easily by the knowledge of the position of the coil and the position of the current
 is dharamapi main kundali ek achaalak dhaanche par bandhi rahati he or is kaaran usamen bhavar dhara nahin utpann hoti
 Hence there is very little resistance in the coil deflection
 kundali dhaatu ke dhaanche par aavisht na hone se dhara pravaahit kiye jane par, apni vikshepasthiti ke donon ore dolan karti he
 It is very sensitive and we can determine the transient charge before it is very accessible
 ye do prakaar ke hote hai : aakarshanwale tathaa pratikarshanwale
 If current flows through a stationary coil of insulating wires, a magnetic field is produced in and around the coil
 is kundali ke paas yadi kachche lohe kaa ek tukdaa lataka diya jaae, to vah kundali kii ore aakarshith ho jaataa he
 If this iron piece is fitted with an indicator, the indicator will also be deflected
 yadi koi aisi vyavastha ho ki lohe ke tukade par jo aakarshan bal he uske vipareet bal lagaakar use santulan main laayaa ja sake, to dhara kaa maan sanketak ke vikshep se pataa chal sakegaa
 Often this attraction is opposed by a spiral spring
 aakarshan bal dhara-maan ke varg ke samaanupati hota he
 Therefore the deflection of the indicator will also be proportional to the square of the current value
 isi kaaran yah prayavarti dhara kaa maan bhi gyaat kar saktaa he
 Between the stationary coils of several wheels of insulating wires, two soft iron thin rods are parallel to the axis of the coil
 ek chad to sthir rahata he, doosraa ek sanketak se judaa he jo swayan ek keel par laga he
 The other end of the indicator rotates on a dial
 jab kundali main dhara pravaahat hoti he, tab donon chad ek hi prakaar ke prerit chumbak ho jate hai
 According to magnetic laws they have repulsion and the iron attached to the indicator rotates, causing a deflection in the indicator
 isamen bhi vikshepanakon dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 These instruments are very simple and cheap
 jab naapane main bahut yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or anek pusht yantron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, tab isi siddhant par bane ameter or voltmapi prayog main laae jate hai
 In power houses, soft iron devices are mostly used on switchboards
 prerit chumbak main aakarshan yaa pratikarshan dharapravaah kii disha par nirbhar nahin hota
 The force is proportional to the square of the torrent
 is kaaran dhara pravaah kii disha kuch bhi ho, bal kii disha ek hi hoti he
 For these reasons, these instruments are used to measure both direct current or reverse current
 kundali ke prerakatv ke kaaran ye ucch aavriti kii prayavartin dhara ke maapnkaarya main nahin prayukt kiye ja sakate
 This type of ammeter depends on the thermal effect of the current
 jab dhara kisi chaalak se pravaahit hoti he, tab vah chaalak tapt ho jaataa he
 The value of the generated heat is proportional to 2 x
 yadi dhara ampiore main or pratirodh om main ho, to The value of heat is proportional to the square of the current, that is, it is not dependent on the direction of current
 isliye aise emeter dishtdhaara athwa prayavarti dhara donon hi ke naapane ke prayog main laae ja sakate hai
 This effect has been used in two ways in the measurement method: pehle prakaar kaa yantra sabase pehle 1883 main major kardyu ne banaaya tha
 hartmann-bron improved it
 taar main dhara bahati he or tapt hone ke kaaran usamen prasar hota he
 At this time, the segmental wire attached to the middle pulls the wire and the pulley rotates according to the spread
 saath hi saath ghirani main laga sanketak bhi vikshepit hota he or dhara kaa maan dial par darshit karata he
 In the absence of current, the wire gets cold and shrinks and the indicator then returns to its former state
 aise dharamapi saral or saste hone ke kaaran bahut prayog main laae gaye hai
 They do not have a coil, so they do not have inductance and a high frequency alternating current is also measured, but they are not sufficiently accurate and are unable to tolerate high currents
 inase adhik suvidhajanak or yatharth taapyugma vaale dharamapi hote hai
 Nowadays, high frequency alternating current is mostly measured by the same instruments

 Insectivorous flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 saamanytah phulon ke anek bhaagon main ek granthi hoti he jise paraag kaha jaataa he jo in kiton ko aakarshith karti hai
 Some flowers have structures called madhursa instructions that tell pollinators where to find honey
 phool paragakon ko khushboo or rang se bhi aakarshith karte hai
 Yet some flowers mimic or imitate to attract pollinators
 udhaaharan ke liye kuch orchid kii prajatiyaan phool srujit karti hai jo kii maadaa madhumakhi ke rang, aakaar or khushboo se mail khate hai
 Flowers are also experts in forms and stamens have such an arrangement that it is ensured that the pollen grains are transferred to the pollinator when it lands on its attracting Vastu
 However, the pollen transfers the pollen to the pistil in all the flowers that are arranged exactly equally

 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 phool-paudhe dwichhidranviy hote hai jo ki do prakaar ke chhidron kaa srijan karte hai
 Pollen and ovules are formed in separate organs, but a typical flower bears bisporangiate strobilus that has both organs
 phool ko ek sanshodhit tana kaha jaataa he, chote internodon or bering ke saath, iske nodes aise sanrachit hote hai jo kii ati sansodhit pattey ho sakate hai
 In short, the structure of a flower is on a modified stem on an anterior meristem, which does not grow continuously
 Flowers are attached to the plant in some ways
 yadi phool tane se jude nahin hote or unka nirmaan paton par hota he to unhen avrint kaha jaataa he jab phool kaa pushpan hota he, to use ek phuleey pushpan kaha jaataa he
 If the flowering flower ends in clusters of flowers, then each trunk that carries the flower is called pedicel
 pushpan vaala tana ek antak rup srujit karata hai jise phool kii kursi yaa uskaa patr kehete hai phool ke hisse patr ke upar vorl main vyavasthit hote hai
 The four main parts of the whorl are as follows: yaddapi upar varnit phulon kii sanrachana ko 'adarsh' sanrachanaatmak yojana mana ja saktaa he, parantu paudhon kii jati is yojana se hatakar badlaav ke vyapak bhinnata ko dikhaate hai
 These changes are very important in the development of flowering plants and botanists use it intensively to establish the relationship between plant species
 masalan phool-paudhon ki do upjatiyaan kaa bhed unke prayek vorl ke phuleey ango ko lekar ho saktaa he: ek dwibipatri ke vorl main adarsh rup main chaar yaa paanch ang hote hai or monocoteledon main teen yaa teen ke gunank vaale ang hote hai
 a group pistil may have only two carpels, or may not be related to the generalization of monocots and dicots given above
 jaisaa ki upar varnit kiya gaya he ki vyaktik phulon ke zyaadaatar naslon main jayang or punkesar dona hote hai
 Botanists describe these flowers as complete, bisexual, hermaphrodite

 Many plants depend on external factors for the transfer of pollen between flowers, including air and animals, especially pests
 Very large animals such as birds, bats, and dwarf poses can also be employed / employed / used
 The period of time in which this process takes place is called anthesis
 ko aakarshith karti hai
 Plants cannot move from one place to another, so many flowers grow in a dispersed population to attract animals to transfer pollen to each flower
 phool jo ki kit-paraagit hote hai unhen kitapargeey kaha jaataa hai jo kii latin main kit-premi ke rup main liya jaataa he
 These can be significantly modified with insects pollinated by co-development, usually in different parts of the flower there are glands called sweet organs that attract animals that are looking for nutritious sweet
 pakshiyon or madhumakhiyon main rang drushti hoti he, jo ki unhen "rangile" phool dhundne main yogya banaate hai
 Some flowers have madhuras directors / directives that show pollinators looking for madhuras, which can only be seen in ultraviolet light, which is visible only to bees and insects
 phool paraagan kartaaon ko gandh or kuch gandh hamaare soonghney kii shakti ke liye bhi sukhad hote hai
 The smell of all flowers does not appeal to humans, many flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh, and flowers that smell like dead animals, often called carrion flowers, include reflexia, titanarum and Paupau of North America

 Still others use mimicry to attract pollinators, for example the flowers of some species of some orchids match the color, shape and fragrance of bees
 nar madhumakhi aise hi phulon main se ek phool se dusre phool par saathi kii talash main ghoomte rahete hai
 The mechanism of pollination by the plant depends on how pollination is used
 adhikansh phool apane paraagan ke tareeke ko lekar mote taur par do samoohon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 Insectivorous: Flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another

 Many flowers rely only on the proximity between the parts of the flower for pollination
 anya jaise kii sarasenia yaa maadaa sleeper orchid ke paas i sunishchit dhaancha hota he jo ki aatmaparagan kaa nirodh karte hue paraagan ko nishchit karata he
 Aphrodisiac flowers: Use of air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, rag grasses of Amboria species and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators due to which they do not have a tendency to 'showy flowers'
 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 Bees and bumblebees actively accumulate aerated pollen corns, although they are not of much importance
 kuch phool swaparagit hote hai or un phulon kaa istemaal karte hai jo kabhi nahin khilte, yaa phool khilne se pehle swaparagit jo jate hai, in phulon ko clisotogamas kaha jaataa he kai prakaar ke viola or salvia prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific types of bacteria
 udahaaran ke liye kai phool ek vishisht keet jati se keval ek keet ko hi aakarshith karte hai, atah safal prajnan ke liye keval us keet par nirbhar karte hai
 This close relationship is often taken as an example of coexistence, as flowers and pollinators are believed to grow over a long period to match each other's needs

 Extreme cases of self-fertilization occur in flowers that are always self-fertile, such as many miscreants
 In contrast, many plant breeds have their own ways of preventing self-fertilization

 Pollen can disintegrate even without bright / golden and clear appearance, so it becomes an obligation to use the plant's resources until it provides no other benefit
 a proposed reason for the sudden presence of fully grown flowers is that they have evolved in a different environment, such as an island or chain of islands, where the plants that held them had a highly specialized relationship with certain animals
 Have evolved from, as in present-day / today, insular breeds / ethnicity

 In the story, he is a chemical engineer, stealing the persona of Redhood in the company he employs
 chori karne ke baad, jise bitman roak detaa he, vah rasinic kachare ke ek tub main gir jaataa he
 He walks out with bleached white skin, red lips, green hair and a permanent smile

 Unfortunately, upon discovery, a written report propounding this theory has been found to have been written by the Joker's crazy companion / girlfriend, Doctor Harleen Quinzel, also known as Harley Quinn, in any courtroom Disqualifies its credibility
