 Organizations use competitive intelligence to compare themselves with other organizations, identify risks and opportunities in their markets, and pressure-test their plans against market reaction that enables them to make informed decisions
 
 zyaadaatar companiyaan aajkal is baat ko jaanane ke mahatv ko samajhati hai ki unke pratidwandvi kya kar rahe hai or udyog kaise badal rahaa he or ekatrit jaankaree se sanghathanon ko apni takat or kamajori ko samajhane main madad milti he
 The real importance of such information for an organization depends on the competitiveness of its markets, the organizational culture and personality and leanings of its top decision makers and the reporting structure of competitive intelligence in the company
 stretagic intelligence : iskaa mukhya kendra apekshaakrit lambii avadhi main do chaar varshon main company kii pratispardhaatmakataa ko prabhavit karne vaale muddon par drushti daalana he
 The actual time frame of SI ultimately depends on the industry and how fast it is changing

 By getting the right amount of information, organizations can avoid unpleasant incidents by anticipating their competitors' moves and reducing response time
 pratispardhaatmak kufia anusandhan ke udhaaharan dainik samachar patron jaise wal street jarnal, bijness wyk or fortune main dekhne ko milte hai
 Major airlines change hundreds of fares daily in response to their competitors' strategies
 ve apane khud ke vipanan, mulya nirdhaaran or utpaadan ranneetiyon kii yojana banane ke liye is jaankaree kaa istemaal karte hai
 Resources like the Internet have made the task of collecting information related to competitors easier
 vishleshak batan dabaakar bhavi pravritiyon or bazaar kii jaruraton kaa pataa laga sakate hai
 However, competitive intelligence is much more than that because its ultimate goal is to gain competitive advantage
 chunki internet mukhyatah saarvajanik kshetra main istemaal kiya jaataa he isliye ekatrit jaankaree ke parinamswaroop keval apni company ke liye vishisht jaankaree praapt kiye jane kii sambhaavna kaaphi kam hoti he
 In fact, there is a risk that information collected from the Internet can be misinformed and mislead users, so competitive intelligence researchers often shy away from using such information
 natijatan internet ko ek mahatvapurn strot ke rup main dekhe jane ke baavjood zyaadaatar siai peshewaron ko praathmik anusandhan ke istemaal se udyog ke visheshgyon saath netwarking, vyapaarik kaaryakramon or sammelnon se, apane khud ke graahakon or aapurtikartaaon se or isi tarah anya sadhano se kufia jaankaree ikaitha karne par apana samay or bajet kharch karnaa chahie
 jahaan internet kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he vahaan praathmik anusandhan ke liye sroton ke saath-saath jaankaree ikaitha karnaa chahie jiske aadhaar par company apane bare main or apni online maujuudagi ke bare main bataati he
 Also important are online subscription databases and news aggregation sources that have simplified the secondary source collection process
 saamaajik media strot bhi mahatvapurn hote ja rahe hai jo sambhavit saakshaatkaar dene waalon ke naamon ke saath-saath vichaaron or vyavhaaron or kabhi-kabhi khaas khabar pradaan karte hai
 Organizations should be careful to spend too much time and effort on old rivals without understanding the existence of a new competitor
 Knowing more about your competitors will help your business grow and succeed
 The practice of competitive intelligence is increasing every year and most companies and business students now understand the importance of gaining information about their competitors
 campatitive intelligence rivyuu main 2006 ke lekh main arjan singh or andrew burshens ke anusaar kisi company kii pratispardhaatmak kufia kshamta ke vikaas ke chaar charan hai
 It starts with stick fetching where a CI department is very responsive to world class where it is fully integrated into the decision making process
 pratispardhaatmak kufia or sambandhit kshetron ke bich aksar bhram utpann ho jaataa he yaa sambandhit kshetron kii tulana main usamen ativyapee tatwon ke hone ke rup main dekha jaataa he jaise bazaar anusandhan, paryaavarniya scanning, vyavsaayik kufia or vipanan anusandhan jo bas naam bhar he
 Some have raised the question of whether the name "competitive intelligence" is also a satisfactory name that can be used for this field
 2003 kii ek kitaab ke adhyay main flessur pratispardhaatmak kufia kii tulana vyavsaayik kufia, pratidwandvi kufia, gyaan prabandhan, bazaar kufia, vipanan anusandhan or ranneetik kufia se karte hai
 The argument given by former SCIP President and CI author Craig Fleischer suggests that there are two forms of occupational intelligence
 iske sankeern rup main pratispardhaatmak kufia se kahin adhik soochna praudyogiki or aatanrik focus shaamil he jabaki isaki vyapak paribhaasha main vastav main siai ke samakaleen abhyaas se kahin adhik tatv shaamil he
 Knowledge management when it has not been achieved properly is also seen as an organizational practice driven by information technology to make it accessible to organizational members for decision-making in relation to data mining, corporate intranets and organizational assets Relies on mapping

 KM is essential for effective innovations
 bazaar kufia udyog-lakshyit kufia he jo bazaar kii aakarshaneeyata ko behatar dhang se samajhane ke liye utpaada yaa seva bazaar main vipanan mishran ke 4 charnon main ghatit hone vaali pratispardhaatmak ghatnaon ke vaastavik samay pahaluon par viksit hua he
 MI Insight, a time-based competitive strategy, is used by marketing and sales managers to accelerate their marketing efforts to respond quickly to consumers in a fast moving and vertical market
 Craig Fleischer suggests that it is not as widely distributed as some forms of CI that are distributed to other adjudicators
 kai anya kufia kshetron kii tulana main bazaar kufia kii samay seemaa bhi thode samay ke liye or ise aam taur par dinon, saptahon, yaa kuch dhimi gati se chalane vaale udyogon main mutthi bhar maheenon main mapa jaataa he
 Marketing research is a strategic, method-driven field that consists primarily of neutral primary research that derives customer statements in the form of beliefs and opinions collected through surveys or focus groups and analyzed through the application of statistical research techniques is done
 iske vipareet, siai aam taur par hitdharakon kii ek vyapak shrenee se vyapak vividhta vaale sroton ko hasil karata he or jo keval maujuuda sawaalon ke hi jawaab nahin dena chahta he balki nae sawaalon ko utpann karne or kaary kaa maargdarshan karne kii bhi chahat rakhata he
 In a 2001 article by Ben Gilead and Jan Herring, the authors establish a set of basic prerequisites that define the unique nature of CI and distinguish it from other information-rich topics such as market research or business development
 ve bataate hai ki gyaan kaa ek saamaanya nikaay or karyanvit upkarnon kaa ek adwitiya set siai ko spasht rup se alag karata he or jabaki vanijyik company main anya samvedi gatividhiyon kaa kendra bazaar main khilaadiyon kii ek shrenee hoti he lekin siai ekmaatr ekikrut vishay he jo sabhi hai impact players par data ke sanshleshan kii maang karata he
 In a subsequent article, Gilead focuses more forcefully on his portrayal of CI on the difference between information and intelligence
 gilaad ke anusaar kai sanghathanaatmak samvedi kaaryon kii samanta, chaahe bazaar anusandhan, vyavsaayik kufia yaa bazaar kufia kaha jaae, yah he ki vyaavhaarik kii drushti se ve tathy or soochna na ki kufia jaankaree pradaan karte hai
 According to Gilead, intelligence is a view of facts and not a fact itself
 vishisht rup se anya korporate kaaryon main pratispardhaatmak kufia jaankaree main company ke samgr pradarshan ke liye bahari jokhimon or avasaron kaa ek vishisht pariprekshya hota he or is tarah yah sanghathan ke jokhim prabandhan gatividhi na ki soochna gatividhiyon kaa hissaa he
 Ethics is a long-standing issue of discussion among CI practitioners
 multah iske ird-gird ghoomane vaale sawaal ye hai ki siai abhyaasakartaaon kii gatividhi kii drushti se kya sweekaarya he or kya sweekaarya nahin he
 Many excellent scholarly measures have been introduced on this subject, most notably through the publications of the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals
 campatitive intelligence athiks: nevegating da grey zone naamak kitaab siai main achaaraniti ke bare main lagbhag bees alag-alag vichaar pradaan karti he or iske saath hi saath vibhinn vyaktyon yaa sanghathanon dwaara istemaal kiye gaye 10 code bhi pradaan karti he
 Combining this with more than two dozen scholarly articles or studies found within the various CI bibliographic entries, it becomes clear that there is no dearth of studies to better classify, understand and address CI ethics is
 pratispardhaatmak soochna ko saarvajanik yaa sadsyta vaale sroton se, pratispardhi karmchaariyon yaa graahakon ke saath netwarking karke, yaa kshetra anusandhan saakshatkaaron se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Competitive understanding research can be contrasted with industrial espionage because CI practitioners generally follow local legitimate guidelines and ethical business norms

 chitra main sampurna raikhik vakr us sthaan ke chumbakeey bal ke purvi avyav ke vicharan kaa sanket karata he
 Since the curves a and b are almost parallel, the bending of one of these shows a contingency relationship of the variances represented by a and B
 It is not inconsistent to understand that most, if not all, of the currents are induced by variations in Earth magnetic forces
 There are currents
 saath hi yah bhi tathy he ki is dhaaraon ke nirmaan main anya kaarak bhi sahaayak ho sakate hai
 There seems to be systematic art difference between a and B

 His surname is a variant of the name Po

 And the other was Ruiko Kuroeva, author of the Japanese mysterious stories
 dwitiya vishavayuddh ke pehle After earning a degree in economics in 1916, he did a variety of small jobs, such as translating newspapers, drawing comics for magazines, selling soba noodles in the street, and working in an old bookstore
 1923 main unhonen apane saahitiyik shuruuaat 'adogva rampo' upnaam main "ni-sen doka" naam ke rahasyamay kahani kii prakaashan se kiya
 This story was revealed in a popular magazine called 'shin Senan' composed for teenagers
 1923 main uske kalam naam "adogva rampo" se likhi gayi rahasy kahani "do sen tambe kaa sikaa"ke prakaashan dwaara apane saahitiyik naukari kii shuruyaat hui
 The story 'shin Cineon' is a popular salt magazine written for teenage audiences
 'shin sinen' pehle po, arthur conan doyal, or jike chesterton sahit pashchimi lekhakon kii kahaniyaan prakashit kiya tha, lekin is patrika ke liye ek japani lekhak dwaara rahasy katha kaa ek bada tukdaa prakashit karnaa pehali baar hua tha
 Such James B
 Harris, erroneously considered it the first piece of a modern mystery novel
 But before Rampo entered the literary scene in 1923, stories from other authors such as Ruiko Kureeva, Kido Okamoto, Junichiro Tanizaki, Haruo Sato and Kaita Murayama Within included elements of investigation, mystery, and crime
 rampo kii pehali kahani "do sen tambe kaa sikaa" ke bare main aalochakon ne bataaya gaya ki ek kahani ke bheetar ek rahasy ko sulajhane ke liye istemaal kiya 'retiasination' kii taarkik prakriya par dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya tha or yah baariki se japani samskruti se sambandhit he
 The story included an extensive "nenbutsu", an indigenous axis based on Buddhist magic, and a description of the Japanese Braille method
 agle kai varshon ke dauraan par, adogva aparaadhon or unhen sulajhane main shaamil prakriyaaon par dhyaan kendrit karne hue anya kahaniyon likhaa gaya
 These stories are now considered classics of popular literature in 20th century Japanese
 "di hill par hatya ke maamle kaa"- ek mahila ke bare main he jo ek parapidak-swapidak vivahetar sambandh ke paathyakram main maar diya jaataa he, "ataari main shikari" ek aadmi ke bare main he, jo ataari me chhipakar apane shikaar logon ke munh me zehar daalate he ,or "maanav kursi", main ek aadmi apane shikaar logo ke shiv se kursi banaakar, usko mahasoos karne ke liye uske upar baithta he - in sab uske anya kahaniyon k udhaharanan hai
 "mirrors of Hell" feature stories such as ramp mirrors, rhythms, and other visual devices
 apni pehali kahaniyon ke kai mukhya rup se tahakikat or aparaadhon ko sulajhane main istemaal kii prakriya ke bare main tha, lekin 1930 se unhe apane kahanio me smavedansheeltaa kaa mail, jo kaamuktha, ajeebogareeb, or 'atarksang' kaa sammiman kiya tha
 The presence of these sensations made people very keen to fall for him and helped to sell the author's stories
 in kahaniyon padakar, logon ko 'asaamaanya kaamuktha" naamak japani tatwo kaa shaamil karne ke liye ek lagaataar pravriti paata he
 For example, in a large part of the novel "monster plot of the Lonely Isle", a gay doctor loved another main character
 1930 ke dashak tak, adogva lokapriy sahitya kii pramukh saarvajanik patrikaon kaa ek number ke liye niyamit rup se likh rahaa tha, or vah japani rahasy upanyaas kii sabase badi aawaaj ke rup main ubhara tha

 unki kai kahaniyon main cogoro apane aparaadhit khilaaf 'bees chehre' ke saath sangharsh karata he
 Kishore Kobayashi was also introduced in his stories as a sidekick to the 1930 novel Kogoro
 in kaaryon main betahasha lokapriy the or abhi bhi kai yuva japani pathakon dwaara padhe rahete hai
 During the second world war 1939 main, do saal marco polo pul haadasa or 1937 main dwitiya china-japan yuddh ke failane ke baad, adogva ke kahani "kamala", prakashit na karne ke liye sarkaar ne sensor board dwaara aadesh diya gaya tha
 "kamala" was distorted about the quadriplegic condition of an experienced human who could not live without help
 sensor board ne jahiraa taur par kahani vartmaan yuddh ke prayaas se kam karnaa hone ke man me kahani par pratibandh laga diya
 The proceeds came as a blow to Rampo, who is trusted by royalties from the publication
