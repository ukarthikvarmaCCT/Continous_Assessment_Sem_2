 Kumaon Motor Owners Union Limited, better known by its acronym KMOU or KEMU, is a private company providing bus services in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand
 1939 main 13 nijee companiyon ke vilay dwaara astitv main aayi yah motor company swatantrata purv kumaun kshetra main basen chalaane vaali ekmaatr bas company thi
 By 1987, it was the largest bus company in the region

 After some time another small company 'the Kumaon Motor Service Company' was started, which was transferred in late 1922 to Sarvashri Devi Lal Shah Ganga Ram
 kuch samay pashchaat teesri company ‘nainital motor transport company’ naam se khuli
 This company was a branch of the British India Corporation Company

 kisi bhautik raashi kaa pariman sankhyaon main vyakt karne ko maapan kaha jaataa he
 Measurement is basically a process of comparison
 isamen kisi bhautik raashi kii maatra kii tulana ek purvanirdhaarit maatra se kii jaati he
 This predefined quantity is called a unit for that particular amount
 udhaaharan ke liye jab ham kehete hai ki kisi ped kii unchaai 10 meter he to ham us ped kii uchai kii tulana ek meter se kar rahe hote hai
 Here the meter is a standard unit used for physical amount length or distance
 isi prakaar samay kaa maatrak second, dravyaman kaa maatrak kilogram aadi hai
 Lord Calvin's following statement proves the importance of measurement - shodh vidhitantr main maapan ko vargeekrut karne kaa ek tarika he maapan ke str kaa nirdhaaran
 Since in measurement, properties are expressed by numbers and numbers have some natural and basic properties such as their exclusiveness, seriality, being located at fixed intervals, etc
; We can classify measurements on the basis of how many properties of numbers are included in it
 is aadhaar par manovaigyanik stanley smith stavence ne maapan ke chaar str bataae - namik maapak, kramik maapak, antaraal maapak or anupaat maapak
 These categories are used in research work and there it is important in the selection of statistical methods being used to test the truth of a hypothesis
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi koi maapan namik yaa kramik str par he to uplabdh aankade kaa ausat gyaat karne ke liye samaantar madhya nahin nikaala ja saktaa keval bahulak kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 In order to get the right knowledge about them while studying natural subjects, it is necessary that we measure some properties of nature
 saadharantaya yah paaya gaya he ki maap main mukhya rup se teen rashiyaan, lambaai, bhaar tathaa samay, uplabdh hoti hai
 Theoretically, the above quantities are included in each measurement
 in raashiyon main se kisi ko bhi maapne ke liye koi nishchit tathaa suvidhajanak pariman ko maanak maan liya jaataa he
 The entire volume is measured in it
 isko ham us vishesh raashi kii ikai, yaa ekak, athwa maatrak maanate hai
 For example, we count the meaning in rupees and the weight in kilograms
 vibhinn prakaar kii ikaiyaan upyog main laai jaati hai
 In science, length, weight and time have been termed as basic units, because these three quantities do not depend on each other
 anya sabhi prakaar kii ikaayiyon kaa aadhaar mul ikaiyaan hi hoti hai
 These other units are termed as derived units
 is prakaar kshetrafal kaa ikai ek aise varg kaa kshetrafal he jisaki lambaai ek ho tathaa chaudaai bhi ek ho
 a unit of volume is considered to be the volume of a money that has the length of each arm
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki kshetrafal kii ikai tathaa aaytan kii ikai lambaai kii ikai se hi utpann hoti hai
 The unit of motion is, by definition, the distance obtained by dividing time by time and since the distance is expressed in length, the unit of motion is based on the original units
 a simple relation of the derived units to the original units has also been found
 praaia: yah paaya jaataa he ki vyutpann ikaiyaan yaa to bahut badi hoti hai athwa bahut choti
 At this stage, some of their multiples, or subgroups, are used from the convenience point of view
 in nai ikaayiyon ko vyaavhaarik ikai ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 In scientific world, two types of units are used for measurement purposes: ise 'foot pound second paddati' bhi kaha jaataa he
 In this method, length is expressed in feet, weight in pounds and time in seconds
 yah pranali khaas taur par un deshon main prachlit he, jo kabhi british samrajya ke ang rah chuke the
 It is used exclusively by British engineers, or trained engineers in Britain, and meteorologists
 But it is being replaced by the metered system
 ise metry paddati, athwa 'centimetre gram second paddati' bhi kehete hai
 This method is used in scientific work all over the world
 isamen lambaai ko centimetre main, bhaar kaa gram main tathaa samay ko ek second main maap jaataa he
 The metric system itself was modified and changed to the meter-kilogram-second system, which was again modified to become an international unit system
 metry pranali main lambaai kii maanak ikai ko meter kehete hai
 Initially, according to democratic French law, it was thought to be equal to 1 / 107th of the distance measured along the meridian crossing from the North Pole to the equator
 lekin aajkal jo maanak mana gaya he vah paris ke nikat sevr main rakhe platinum-iridium mishradhatu ke ek danda ke siron par bane do chihnon ke bich kii duuri he, jab danda shunya degree centegrade par hota he
 This is called a standard meter
 is sarini se vidit hota he ki 1 millimetre = 0
1 centimetre = 0
01 desimetre = 0
001 meter
 Hence units in the metered system can be changed only by transferring decimals, which is very convenient
 is prakaar yah spasht he metry pranali atyant suvidhajanak paddati he
 In astronomy, the unit used to measure distance is termed light year
 prakaash ek varsh main jitani duuri tay karata he usee ko khagol vigyaan main suvidha ke hetu duuri kii ikai mana gaya he
 Hence 1 light year = 9
45 x 1015 m
 british pranali, arthath foot pound second paddati main, lambaai kii maanak ikai british rajkeey gaj he
 This is the distance between the lines formed on the gold bars at the bronze poles at 62 degrees Fahrenheit temperature in London's treasury office
 lambaai kii sab maapon kii tulana se yah baat spasht ho jaati he ki sab paddatiyon main metry pranali sabase adhik suvidhajanak tathaa vaigyanik he
 Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has made a law for the use of the metered system in the entire country
 dono paddatiyon main lambaai kii ikaayiyon main ye sambandh hai : Wires made of wood or metal, scale rails, or other objects, are used to measure length
 inke kinare yaa to centimetre tathaa millimetre main khude rahete hai, athwa inch tathaa uske dasven, aathven yaa solahaven anshon main
 Measuring chains are used to measure long distances, or long distances in curved lines, especially in ground surveys
 jab paimaanon ko lambaai kii sidh main suvidha se nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, tab parkaar, dand parkaar, yaa ek saadhaaran callyper upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The inner and outer diameters are also measured with ordinary calipers
 pipe aadi ke konon kii maap karne ke liye vrittiya chal varneer banaae gaye hai
 If needed to measure up to 1 / 10th of a millimeter, a moving vernier is used there
 bahut hi choti lambaaiyon ko, jaise kisi chaddar kii motaai yaa ek patale taar kaa vyas aadi, maapne ke liye scrugese upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The unit of area is square centimeters in meter system and square feet in British method
 aaytan kii ikai metry pranali main ek ghan kilogram shuddh pani ke aaytan ko metry paddati main aaytan kii ikai, arthath litre, kehete he
 Generally, a cubic decimeter is considered equivalent to a liter
 aaytan kii ikai british paddati main ghanfoot kehalaati he
 The standard measure of capacitance in this method is called the gallon
 62 degree pha0 taap par 10 pound asut pani 1 galen ke baraabar mana gaya he
 It has been found that 1 gallon = 4
54 liters
 dharita kii metra ikai ko litre mana gaya he
 With respect to 13 cubic inches, it has been found that the weight of one cubic inch of pure water without air at 4 ° c is 252
297 grains
 metry paddati main dravyaman kii ikai ko gram kehete hai or ek gram kaa bhaar 4 degree sein0 taap ke shuddh pani ke ek ghan centimetre ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 The unit of mass in the British system is called a pound
 yah ek platinum ke belan kaa bhaar he, jo landan ke rajkeey karyaalay main rakhaa he
 Units of mass have found a correlation between the two methods, which is as follows: hamen surya akaash ke aar-paar jaataa maaloom padataa he
 The highest position or highest elevation of the Sun in the sky is when it is at the post-yamaya
 yamyottar se surya ke do baar jane ke antaraal ko drusht surya din kehete hai
 For many reasons, the duration of sight-sun-day varies from day to day, but after one year it repeats the same change cycle
 varsh kii avadhi 365 1 / 4 dinon kii hoti he
 If we add the time period of all the days of the year and divide it by the whole days of the year, we get a time interval, which the scientists have termed "mean sun day"
 is samay ko choubees ghanton main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Each hour is divided into sixty minutes and each minute into sixty seconds
 samay kii ikai ko metry tathaa british donon paddatiyon main second mana gaya he, jo madhya surya din kaa 1 / 86,400 vaan hissaa he
 The period of time that occurs in the gradual movements of a stationary star across the vertex of a place is called the period between the gradual meridians of the star, or the sidereal day
 iskaa maan sthir paaya gaya he
 Nakshatra day is about four minutes less than the mean sun day
 yah maaloom karne ke liye ki do samyantaral baraabar hai yaa nahin, athwa maanak samay ko baraabar samay ke upantaral main vibhajit karne ke liye, dolak kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Two time intervals are said to be equal only when each has the same oscillation number of oscillators
 yadi dolak ke dolanon kii sankhya ek "madhya saura din" main 60x60x24 hoti he, to prayek daalan kaa samyantaral ek second kaha jaataa he
 The mean solar age is used in our watches

 Its author is Badarayan

 Many commentaries have also been written on this
 veydant ke teen mukhya stambh maane jate hai - upanishad, bhagavadagita evam brahmasutra
 All three are called the Departure Trilogy
 isamen upanishdon ko shruti prasthaan, gita ko smriti prasthaan or brahmasutron ko nyaay prasthaan kehete hai
 Calling the Brahman Sutras a justice departure means that it presents Vedanta in a completely logical manner
 pracheen parampara ke anusaar vedantasutra ke lekhak baadaraayan maane jate hai
 But in these formulas, the name of Badarayana has been quoted and his opinion is cited, so some people do not consider it as a work of Badrayana and it is called the work of a later collector
 baadaraayan or vyas kii kabhi-kabhi ek mana jaataa he
 Jaimini mentions Badarayana in his predecessor book and Badrayana mentions Jaimini in Vedantasutras
 yadi baadaraayan or vyas ek hi hai to mahabharat kii parampara ke anusaar jaimini vyas ke shishy the

 Max Müller considers it to be the earlier work of the Bhagavad Gita because it contains the word Brahmasutra which is synonymous with Vedantasutra

 Just as the interpretation of the ritualistic part of the Veda is presented in the Mimamsasutra, the interpretation of the Upanishads, the last part of the Vedic hymns, is given in about 500 Vedantasutras divided into four chapters
 upanishdon main pratipaadit siddhant itane paraspar virdohi tathaa bikhare hue he ki unase ek paprakaar kaa darshanik mat nikaalnaa kathin he
 The Vedānta Sutra formulates a philosophical vision in the Upanishads by resorting to the principle of ‘coordination’
 par ye sutara swayan itane sankshipt he ki bina vyakhya ke sahare unase arth nikaalnaa kathin he
 Due to their brevity, many interpretations were written on them which renders Vedanta in conflicting terms
 vedant ke sabhi prasthaan in sutron ko apana pramaan maanate hai
 These formulas are also called Brahmasutras due to the rendering of Brahma
 brahmasutra main chaar adhyay hai jinke naam hai - samanvay, avirodh, saadhan evam fal
 Each chapter has four legs

 hamaari prithvi or surya jis gallexi main avasthit hai, raatri main ham nangi aankh se usee gallexi ke taaraon ko dekh pate hai
 So far, there are estimated to be about 19 billion galaxies in every part of the universe that has been detected
 brahmad ke visphot siddhant ke anusaar sabhi gallexien ek duusare se badi teji se dur hatati ja rahi hai
 a hundred billion galaxies exist in the universe
 jo badi maatra main taare, gas or khagoleey dhul ko samete hue he
 Galaxies began their lives millions of years ago and gradually regained their present form
 prayek gallexiyaan arabon taron ko ko samete hue he
 Gravity binds the stars together, and in this way many galaxies live together in a cluster of stars
 prarambh main khagolashastriyon kii dharna thi ki brahmad main nai gallexiyon or kwasron kaa janm sambhavat: puraani gallexiyon ke visphot ke falswaroop hota he
 But astronomers from York University — Dr

E
 Wright refute this notion by studying the interactions of four groups of galaxies
 unhone yah bataaya ki gallexiyon ke bich main aisi visphotak antar kriyaayein nahin hoti hai jo nai gallexiyon ko janm de saken
 The center of most galaxies is a spherical part filled with stars, called the nucleus, and the nucleus is attached to a planar circular disk around it
 khagolvigyaani gallexiyon ko unke aakaar ke aadhaar par mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main vibhajit karaten he
 Nobody knows why galaxies assume a certain form
 shaayad yah gallexiyon ke ghurnan ke veg or usame sthit taron ke banane ki gati par nirbhar karata he
 The width and brightness of our Galaxy is not universal

 When viewed from a distance, numerous stars appear in the galaxy
 vibhinn chamak ke taron kii sankhya ginakar, unki duuri kii gananaa kar or unki gati naapakar jyotishiyon ne gallexi ke vaastavik rup kaa bahut acha anumaan laga liya he
 If one considers the form of the galaxy in a three-dimensional recess instead of the one seen in the sky, then it is found that the galaxy is almost like a flat circular wheel whose part near the axis is somewhat bloated
 chitra main gallexi kaa bagal se chitra dikhaaya gaya he 
 The diameter of this wheel is about one million light years, miles or 63 thousand times the distance of the Sun from Earth) and the thickness is between 3,000 and 6,000 light years
 centre ke paas kii motaai lagbhag 15,000 prakashavarsh he
 The stars in our Galaxy are not evenly distributed
 bich bich main anek taraguchh hai or isaki bhi sambhaavna he ki devayani niharika ke samaan hamaari gallexi main bhi sarpil kundaliyaan hon
 There are microscopic dust and gases in the middle of the stars, which spoil the light of the distant stars
 dhuli or gas kaa ghanatv sanstha ke madhytal main adhik he
 Somewhere black clouds have formed due to thick cloud of dust
 kahin gas ke badal paas ke taron ke prakaash se uddipt hokar chamakati niharika ke rup main dikhaai padate hai
 The mass of our galaxy is approximately one trillion times the mass of the Sun
 isamen se praaia: aadha to taron kaa dravyaman he or aadha dhuli or gas kaa
 Our Galaxy is like a puffed circle in the middle
 isamen ek vrutt ke bheetar hi ve sab taare hai jo hamen akaash main pruthak-pruthak dikhaai padate hai
 Stars and galaxies are scattered sparsely around our galaxy
 hamaari gallexi ke centre ke paas taare sankhya main adhik ghaney hai or kinare kii ore apekshaakrit bikhare hue hai
 All the stars are rotating around the center, the stars near the center are at high speed and the far ones are at low speed
 hamaara surya centre se lagbhag 30-35 hajaar prakashavarsh dur he or gallexi ke madhya tal main hai
 For this reason, we see our galaxy like the mekhala which is described above
 prithvi se gallexi kaa centre dhanu taramandal kii ore he
 That's why it revolves around the center of the Galaxy
 is parikrama main uskaa veg 150 mile prati senkad hai
 Even at this velocity, the sun takes 200 million years in the entire orbit

 Their distribution is spherical
 in taragucchon ke vitaran se gallexi kaa centre gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Measuring the speed of wires also helps in the calculation of the center
 rup or vistaar main gallexi bahut si agong niharikaon se milti julati hai

 He sat on the throne of Kalachuri Chedi kingdom around 1015 AD
 uske pita kokelldev dwitiya or dada yuvarajdev dwitiya ke samay rajya kii sthiti kuch kamjor ho chali thi
 Ganga Deva not only handled this situation, he again made Chediraj a very powerful and influential state of India
 kocall dwitiya ke samay chedirajya or kalyaan ke chalukyon main ladaai aarambh ho chuki thi
 This continued during the time of Ganga Dev
 gangeyadev ne parmaar raja bhojagurjar or cholraj rajendra gurjar se milakar chalukya raja jaisingh gurjar par akraman kiya, kintu is akraman main ise kuch vishesh safalataa na mili

 Magadhraj Nayapal also defeated and gave him a lot of money
 kintu uski sabase mahatvapurn vijay chandelon par hui
 Perhaps in the early period of his reign he had to bow down in front of Chandelraj Vidyadhar Gurjar

 Along with their dead bodies, food, beverages, clothing, jewels, utensils, instruments, weapons, animals and sometimes even servant servants were buried
 bharat kii tarah hi misr kii sabhyataa bhi bahut puraani he or pracheen sabhyataa ke avshesh vahaan kii gaurav gaatha kehete hai
 In fact, there are 138 pyramids in Egypt and three in Giza, a suburb of Cairo, but contrary to normal belief, only the 'great Pyramid' of Giza is in the list of seven wonders of the ancient world
 duniya ke saat pracheen aashcharyon main shesh yahi ekmaatr aisa smarak he jise kaal pravaah bhi khatm nahin kar sakaa
 This pyramid is 450 feet high

 It is made up of 25 lakh limestone blocks, each of which weighs between 2 and 30 tons
 great pyramid ko itani parishuddhta se banaaya gaya he ki vartmaan takanic aisi kriti ko doharaa nahin sakati
 Until a few years ago, scientists could not detect its microscopic symmetry, it is far from being a model! Evidence suggests that it was built as a tomb by the fourth dynasty of Egyptian ruler Khofu around 2560 BC
 ise banane main kareeb 23 saal lage
 Questions have often been raised about this great pyramid of Egypt, how the Egyptians, without machines, without modern tools, drove the huge stone blocks 450 feet high and completed this huge project in just 23 years? Pyramid penetrator Evan Haddington calculated that if this happened, dozens of workers would have to place a stone block every other minute for 10 hours of work every day for 365 days of the year
 kya aisa sambhav tha? vishaal shramashakti ke alaava kya pracheen misravasiyon ko sookshm ganitiya or khagoleey gyaan rahaa hoga? visheshgyon ke mutabik pyramid ke baahar pashaan khandon ko itani kushalta se taraasha or feet kiya gaya he ki jodon main ek blade bhi nahin ghusaayi ja sakati
 Many astronomical bases have also been found in the construction of Egyptian pyramids, such as the three pyramids lined by three stars of the Arian zodiac

 kasheruki, ekinodermata vansheey jantu, keet or molsk sahit, kuch jantuon main, amashay ek peshiy, khokhla, poshan nalee kaa failaa hua bhaag he jo pachan nalee ke pramukh ang ke rup main kaary karata he
 It is included in the second phase of digestion, after chewing
 amashay, grass nalee or choti aant ke bich main sthit hota he
 It secretes protein-digestive enzymes and strong acids to aid in the digestion of food through free muscle cramps, before sending partially digested food to the small intestines
 amashay ke liye prayukt angrezi shabd stomach latin ke stomachus se vyutpann he, jo greek shabd stomachos se or antat stoma yani "munh" se utpann hua he
 The words gastro - and gastric are both derived from the Greek word gaster
 yahaan tak ki amoeba or maansaahaari padpon main bhi aisi sanrachanaayen maujuud hai jo amashay ke anuroop hai
 The body enters the stomach through the esophagus through the esophagus
 amashay proteis or hydrochloric amla mukt karata he, jo jeevanuon ko maarthe yaa rokte hai or proteizon ko kaam karne ke liye amleey ph uplabdh karaate hai
 Food is churned through the contraction of the wall muscles, when the body is converted into acid, before the stomach is wrapped around the fundus and the stomach structure, reducing the amount of fundus
 amlann dhire-dhire jatharanirgam sankochi ke madhyam se gujarata he or grahani main pahunchataa he, jahaan poshak tatwon kii nikasi shuru hoti he
 Depending on the amount and dietary content, the stomach digests food between 40 minutes to a few hours in the form of acid
 amashay grass nalee or grahani ke bich sthit hota he 
 yah udar guha ke baayen upree bhaag main maujuud hota he
 The upper part of the stomach is opposite to the diaphragm

 They are the Grass ductal barrier dividing the tube above and the pyloric barrier dividing the stomach from the small intestine
 amashay paranukanpi or sahjanukanpi snayujaal, jo apni mansapeshiyon kii sravan gatividhi or prerak kriyalap, donon ko niyantrit karata he
 In humans, the stomach is dull, about 45 milliliters empty
 Is the amount of yah ek lacheela ang he
 It is normally diluted to hold 1 liter of food, but it can hold up to 2-3 liters
 pet ko 4 bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, jinamein se prayek kii alag koshikaayen or bhinn kaary hai
 These parts are: amashay kii nune vakrata ko dayee jathreey dhamni dwaara kam aapurti kii jaati he or bain jathreey dhamni dwaara zyaada, jo hriday kshetra ko bhi aapurti karti he
 Higher curvature is supplied less by the right gastric-vapa artery and more by the left gastric-vapa artery
 The fundus of the stomach and the upper part of the great curvature are supplied by the small gastric artery
 jathrantra nalika ke anya bhaagon kii tarah, amashay kii deevaaren, andar se baahar, nimnlikhit paraton se bani hoti hai: The epithelium of the stomach forms deep pits
 in sthanon par grathiyon ke naam sangat pet ke bhaag ke anusaar hai: Different types of cells are found in different layers of these glands: pet main rasayanon kaa sanchalan or pravaah, donon swytt tantrika pranali or vibhinn pachan pranali hormone dwaara niyantrit hote hai: The extracellular growth factor or EGF results in cellular accretion, differentiation and residue
 EGF ek pehle mouse abdhohanuj granthi se shuddh nune-aanvik-bhaar vaala polypeptid he, lekin baad main jo appdhohunaj granthi, karnamul granthi sahit kai maanav utakon main paaya gaya
 The salivary EGF, which appears to be regulated by dietary inorganic iodine, also plays an important physiological role in the maintenance of oral cavity and gastric tissue completeness
 laarmay EGF ke jaivik prabhaavon main shaamil he maukhik or amashay-grasanaleey ulcer, jathreey amla avrodh, srav, diene sanshleshan kaa uddipan or saath hi jathreey amla, pitt amla, pepsin or trisine jaise intraluminal hanikaarak ghatakon or bhautik, rasinic or jaivik agenton se shleshmik sangrakshan
 The stomach can "taste" sodium glutamate using glutamate receptors and this information is passed through the vagus nerve to the parietal subcutaneous and marginal systems in the brain as a tasty signal
 amashay bhi jeebh or maukhik swaad grahiyon kii tarah swatantra rup se glucose, carbohydrate, protein, or vasa ko samaj saktaa he
 This allows the brain to associate the nutritional value of the diet with their taste
 aitihaasik rup se, vyapak taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki amashay kaa ucch amleey parivesh pet kii sankraman se pratiraksha kar saktaa he
 However, a large number of studies have indicated that the majority of cases of colic, gastritis and gastric cancer are Helicobacter pylori infection
 haalanki amashay kaa sateek rup or aakaar vibhinn kasherukiyon main vyapak rup se alag hota he, par grasanaleey or grahani ke pravesh dwaaron kii sambhddha sthiti apekshaakrit sthir rahi he
 As a result, the limb always bends somewhat to the left, before turning back to meet the pyloric barrier
 tathaapi, lampre, hagfish, kemira, langs fish or kuch teliost machhlee main grass nalee sidhe aant main khulte hue, amashay hi nahin hota he
 All these animals consume diets that do not require much storage, or pre-digestion with digestive juices, or both

 The distribution of these glands differs between species and does not always correspond to the same region as humans
 iske alaava, kai gaiyr maanviya stanadhariyon main, hriday grathiyon ke aage amashay kaa kuch hissaa grass nalee ke samaan anivaary rup se upakalaa se astarit hota he
 In particular, the stomach of the diaphragm is complicated, with the first three cells lining the esophagus mucosa
 pakshi or makar jati ke jantuon main amashay do kshetron main vibhajit hota he
 Further, a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus, is lined by the fundus glands and connects the right stomach to the gallbladder

 Thousands of devotees started visiting Har Mandir Sahib premises on June 2, because June 3 was the martyrdom day of Guru Arjun Dev
 udhar jab pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne desh ko sambodhit kiya to ye spasht tha ki sarkaar sthiti ko kaasi gambhirtha se dekh rahi he or bharat sarkaar koi bhi karrwai kar sakati he
 Trains and bus services to and from Punjab were banned, phone connections were cut, and foreign media was thrown out of the state
 teen june ko bhartiya sena ne amritsar pahunchakar swarna mandir parisar ko gher liya
 Curfew was imposed in the city in the evening
 chaar june ko sena ne golibari shuru kar di taaki mandir main maujuud morchaband charampanthiyon ke hathiyaaron or asalhon kaa andaaza lagaaya ja sake
 It received such a sharp response from the extremists that on June 5, it was decided to use armored vehicles and tanks

 On October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi's brutal killing came as a result of the religious sentiments of Sikhs, hurt by Operation Blue Star

 Even though the Adivasis of Indian Sociology may not be formalized, they have enriched this discipline in independent India with their theoretical contributions, unique understanding of caste and the method of participatory observation that they have given to the top sociologists of the country
 Enough to include
 samajashaastra main unhen samskruthikaran, prabhutvshaalee jati or vot bank jaisi moulik prasthaapanaaon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Srinivas was also the creator of the institutions
 baroda or dilli vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke vibhaagon kii sthapana kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 His contribution to the development of Indian sociology will also be considered as classical in terms of establishing and guiding high-level institutions of research and study
 gramin samudaay or jati kii sanrachana ke vishisht adhyayan ke alaava em
en
 shrinivas ne vigyaan ke saamaajik prabhaav, gandhi ke dharmik chintan, maanavshaastra ke itihaas se lekar gender jaise vishyon par bhi vicharottejak kaam kiya he
 Srinivas's work is considered to be a rare confluence of objective supervision, fineness of analysis and theoretical depth
 unka lekhan antar-vishyaktaa ko ek khaas tarah kaa jamini sandarbh pradaan karata he
 Srinivas's sociological vision explores the external structure of events and fathoms the structures and historical forces that compose them
 saamudayik jivan ke baarik byoron or antardrushtiyon ko saral bhashaa main prastut karne kii unki kshamta unhen samakaleen samajashastriyon se ek alag vyaktitv pradaan karti he
 In this sense, they transcend the thematic vocabulary and choose the simple and popular language
 ise unki vidvatta kaa janawaad hi kaha jayega ki unki saidhantik avadharanaayen apane kutarthon main uljhane ke bajaay vishay ko samajhane main zyaada madad karti hai
 Srinivas created a new land for Indian sociology at the level of ideology
 ullekhneey he ki jis daur main shrinivas bhartiya samaaj ke adhyayan kii taiyaari kar rahe the us samay samaaj-vigyaanon par america or british academik prasthapanaayen haaavee thi
 The prevailing approach in American universities emphasized Sanskritic traditions to understand the society of the Indian subcontinent
 iske asar main bhartiya samajashastri samakaleen yatharth ke adhyayan ke liye sanskrit ke sroton or bharat- vidya / indolji ko zyaada pramanik maanate the
 Srinivas was the first sociologist to challenge this dominant position
 unhone apane lekhan se sabit kiya ki samajashaastra main samaaj ke vaastavik kaaryakalapon or gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan shastreey sandarbhon par nirbhar rahane se zyaada shreyaskar he
 The concepts of dominant caste and Sanskritisation presented by Srinivas have been widely used by historians of streams like subaltern of history-writing besides political scientists
 is arth main unke krititv ko ek bauddhik parampara kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo naye-puraane vidwaanon ke liye ek zaruri sandarbh kii haisiyat hasil kar chukaa he
 Incidentally, the concept of dominant caste reflects dominance in a particular village or region of a caste due to factors such as number force, land ownership, education and job, so Sanskritisation is the culture of upper castes especially Brahmin class by lower castes
 Indicates the tendency to adopt customs, language and costumes etc
 haalaanki unki teesri avadharana vot bank, samaaj-vigyaanon main sthai jagah nahin bana paayi parantu raajnneeti ke dainik vimarsh or media jagat main is pad kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In studying the political and social structure of independent India, all these three concepts and related discourse have acquired immediate significance
 prabhutvshaalee jati or samskruthikaran kii avadharanaayen bharat kii saamaajik vyavastha or uske santhnik dhaanche ke nirnaayak tattvon ko samajhane main madad karti hai
 Although the concept of Sanskritisation is no longer considered as important due to the decreasing legitimacy of Brahminical ideals, the fact remains that Sanskritisation was a fairly notable trend for a long period of the twentieth century and even after independence
 dalit andolan or mandal ayog ke baad ubhari raajnneeti main samskruthikaran kii pravriti ksheen hoti gayi he lekin prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana ko bharat ke gramin samaaj main chalane vaali raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa vishleshan karne main aaj bhi ek jaruri aujaar kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 Many contemporary sociologists have been urging to assess Srinivas's work in the larger context of nationalist sociology
 unka kahana he ki swatantra bharat kaa shahari abhijan aupniveshik shashan ke aadhunikeekaran kii pariyojna ko jari rakhana chahta tha
 Therefore, the same colonial arrays of thought and thought were active in the work of nationalist sociologists on the basis of which the British power had been legitimizing its rule
 in vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati or samudaay par kendrit shrinivas jaise samajashastriyon kaa krititv ek akhil bhartiya sanskritvaadi hindu dharm kii samaj ko peethika pradaan karata he
 But Srinivas's vision is a hasty plea to be overtly or indirectly guided by the foundations of British or American anthropology, which, despite the lack of evidence, dares to prepare charge sheets
 yah daleel shrinivas ke krititv kii us pravriti ko lakshith karne main chook karti he jisamen shrinivas samudaay kaa adhyayan karte hue samudaay or apane sambandhon ke dwait par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Srinivas considers the basic foundations of sociology and anthropology in a similar way
 gauratlab he ki shrinivas sahabhaagi adhyeta ke taur par khud ko ek aise adhyeta ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisaki iyatta apane vishay yani logon se alag nahin he
 Srinivas did not classify the people or community he studied
 is sambandh main kai british maanavshastri yah maanate rahe hai apane samaaj kaa adhyayan karne vaale maanavshastri ko alag tarah kii mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 According to him, the anthropologist of the developed country always wants to imprison an indigenous anthropologist in a particular mold by pointing to his inferior position
 shrinivas ne is masale par deshaj maanavshastri kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ki jab koi bhartiya maanavshastri bharat kii kisi jati yaa anya samooh kaa adhyayan karata he to vah jati yaa samooh uske liye anya bhi hota he lekin saath hi is baat ko darkinar nahin karnaa chahie ki us jati yaa samooh ke katipay saanskrithik rup, vishwaas or mulya ukt adhyeta se bhi mail khate hai
 That is, in such a situation the Indian anthropologist actually studies the self in one way or the other
 is myne main vah jati yaa samooh uske liye nitant aparichit yaa anya nahin rah jaataa kyonki donon ek hi samskruti se jude hote hai
 Srinivas considers this situation as unusually complex, multilayered and duplex
 dhyaan se dekhen to shrinivas apane vishay ke saath antar or samanta ke jin binduon baat karte hai unhen dekhte hue un par rashtravaadi samajashastri hone kaa aarope damdaar nahin lagata
 In fact, Srinivas stresses that this multiplicity of self and others in study is far better than the anthropologist's singularity of being a member or an outsider of his community
 yah gauratlab he ki apane shodh adhyayan ke liye shrinivas ne jis rampura gaanv ko chunaa tha uski jati vyavastha ke adhyayan main ve chicago skool ke kai prekshanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Srinivas proving the pre-british concept of varna as a bookish point of view, saying that this vision dwarfs the dynamic aspects of caste
 haalaanki shrinivas kaa jati-adhyayan ek gaanv kii sthaneey sanrachana par kendrit tha lekin vah is parighatna kii akhil bhartiya vyapti ko lekar bhi sachet the
 In one of his articles, he points to the fact that caste is undoubtedly an all-india structure, as groups can be seen everywhere in the country that form a distinct group based on paternal and marital relationships
 shrinivas is sambandh main in samoohon ke parmparik rojgaar kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 He also says that the existence of castes serving Brahmins, untouchables, farmers, artisans, merchants and others can be seen everywhere in the country
 jati ke is adhyayan main shrinivas kshetreey bhinnataaon or pashchimi shiksha, prashasnic naukari, shahar se milane vaali aay jaise karkon kaa bhi ullekh karte hai jinka jati kii sanrachana par vyapak asar padaa he
 In the long term, Srinivas, as a sociologist, has also freed the Indian village and caste structure from the theoretical dominance of colonial perceptions
 or saath hi dyumon jaise samajashastri kii manyataon kaa bhi pratwaad kiya jo yah pratipaadit kar rahe the ki jatigat vibhinnataayen bhartiya gaanv ko samudaay kaa rup nahin lene detii
 When Srinivas talks about the concept of rural community and the economic-cultural interdependence of villages, he also talks about All India Civilization in a latent manner
 kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki shrinivas ne jati ke adhyayan main brahmanvaadi yaa ucch jati kaa drushtikon apanaaya he
 But looking at this argument from the right angle, it seems to have originated from colonial sociology
 shrinivas kii tark-yojana vastav main pashchimi samajashastriyon kii bharat ke gramin samudaayon ke sambandh main pratipaadit sthool or alp-chintit dharanaon ko ujagar karti he
 In a nutshell, Srinivas's work provides many basic arguments in the Western discourse of philosophical propositions, perceptions of self, community and nation

 hansajii ko "guru maharaj ji", bhi kaha jaataa he, chah saal baad unka nidhan ho gaya
 After this, his eight-year-old son assumed the title of spiritual teacher and assumed the title of father 'guru Maharaj Ji'
 Since Guru Maharaj ji was small at that time, his mother, mother and elder brother Bal Bhagwan Ji took over the management of the Divine Light Mission
 In 1971, thirteen-year-old Guru Maharajji visited Britain and America

 The thirty-first pupil, named Kaushalya, told his story in this way - King Vikramaditya had grown old and with his yoga power he also knew that his end was now very near
 ve raaj-kaaj or dharm kaary donon main apane ko lagaae rakhte the
 He also maintained a house for meditation in the forest
 ek din usee awaas main ek raat unhen alokik prakaash kahin dur se aata maaloom padaa
 When he looked closely, it came to know that all the light was coming from the hills in front
 is prakaash ke bich unhen ek damakata hua sundar bhawan dikhaai padaa
 He had a curiosity to see the building and recalled the two hospitals provided by Kali
 unke aadesh par vetaal unhen pahari par le aae or unase bole ki ve iske aage nahin ja sakate
 On asking the reason, he told that a Yogi has surrounded Tantra around that building and he resides in that building
 un gheron ke bheetar vahi pravesh kar saktaa he jiskaa punya us yogi se adhik ho
 Knowing the truth, Vikram stepped towards the building
 ve dekhnaa chaahate the ki unka punya us yogi se adhik he yaa nahin
 While walking, they came to the entrance of the building
 ekaek kahin se chalakar ek agni pind aayaa or unke paas sthir ho gaya
 At the same time someone heard an obedient voice from within
 vah agnipind sarakkar peeche chalaa gaya or pravesh dwaar saafe ho gaya
 When Vikram entered in, the same voice started asking him to introduce him
 usne kaha ki sab kuch saafe-saafe bataaya jaae nahin to vah aane vaale ko shraap se bha kar degaa
 By then Vikram had reached the chamber and saw that Yogi stood up
 unhone jab use bataaya ki ve vikramaditya hai to yogi ne apane ko bhaagyashaalee bataaya
 He said that he did not expect Vikramaditya to see him
 yogi ne unka khub aadar-satkar kiya tathaa vikram se kuch maangane ko bolaa
 King Vikramaditya asked for that building with all facilities
 vikram ko vah bhawan saunpkar yogi usee van main kahin chalaa gaya
 While walking he reached far enough, he met his guru
 uske guru ne usase is tarah bhatakane kaa kaaran jaananaa chaha to vah bolaa ki bhawan usne raja vikramaditya ko daan kar diya he
 His teacher laughed
 usne kaha ki is prithvi ke sarvshereshth daanveer ko vah kya daan karegaa or usne use vikramaditya ke paas jaakar brahman rup main apana bhawan phir se maang lene ko kaha
 He disguised and met Vikram in the hut in which he used to practice
 usne rahane kii jagah kii yachana kii
 Vikram asked him to ask for his desired place and he asked for that building
 vikram ne muskuraakar kaha ki vah bhawan jyon kaa tyon chhodkar ve usee samay aa gaye the
 They had taken that building from him just to test him

 But he could not sit on his throne

 He was confused that one day Vikram himself came in a dream
 unhone putr ko us singhaasana par baithne ke liye pehle devatv praapt karne ko kaha
 He told him that the day he would be able to sit on that throne with his virtuousness and fame, then he himself would tell it in a dream
 magar vikram uske sapane main nahin aae to use nahin soojha ki singhaasana kaa kiya kya jaae
 On the advice of pundits and scholars, he slept after remembering his father one day and Vikram came in the dream
 sapane main unhone usase us singhaasana ko zamin main gadwa dene ke liye kaha tathaa use ujjain chhodkar ambavathi main apni nai rajdhani banane kii salaah di
 He said that whenever a king with all the virtues on earth would be born in the long run, this throne would automatically go under his authority

 sainikon kaa bhugtan mul rup se namak tha or vetan shabd isi se niklaa he
 

 "plinius Naturalis Historia XXXI
 Others' comment is that Soldier is more likely to have originated from Gold Solidus, through which soldiers are aware of the payment and in turn they say that salarium is either salt There was an allowance for the purchase of or the cost of keeping troops to cope with the salt supplies and the protection of the salt routes leading to Rome
 sateek sambandh par dhyaan die bagaiyr, roman sainikon ko bhugtan kiye gaye sailarium ko tab se pashchimi deshon main kaary ke badale mazdooree ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he or isane "kisi ke namak kaa haq adaa karne" ke rup main un abhivyaktiyon ko badhaava diya he
 Yet within the Roman Empire or in medieval and pre-industrial Europe and its trading colonies, salaried employment appears to have been relatively rare and particularly limited to servants and high-status roles, especially government service

 Other common alternative models of work included self- or participatory-based employment such as specialists in the category of artisans who often had salaried assistants or shared work and ownership, as in medieval universities and monasteries
