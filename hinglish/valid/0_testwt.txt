 Hindi grammar is the scripture to understand the rules of writing and speaking the Hindi language in pure form
 yah hindi bhashaa ke adhyayan kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he
 In it all forms of Hindi are studied under four sections; For example, under the Varna idea, the rules regarding the different aspects of the word under the sound and the letter and the word idea, and the different situations related to the sentence under the sentence idea and the artistic aspects of literary works have been considered in the verse idea
 varna vichaar hindi vyakaran kaa pehla khand he, jisamen bhashaa kii mul ikai dhwani tathaa varna par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Under this, the rules related to the definition of basic letters of Hindi, the distinction, pronunciation, combination, alphabet etc
 are described
 hindi bhashaa kii lipi devanagari he
 The Devanagari alphabet has a total of 52 letters, including 11 vowels, 33 consonants, an anusvara and a visarga
 iske atirikt hindi varnmaala main do dvigun vyanjan tathaa chaar sanyukt vyanjan hote hai
 There are a total of eleven vowels in Hindi language
 ye gyaarah swar hai- a, aa, i, i, u, uu, ri, e, i, o, ou
 'an' and 'aah' are not counted in the vowel
 inhen ayogavah dhvaniyaan kehete hai
 The word idea is the second section of Hindi grammar under which rules related to the definition of the word, differences, terms, disjunctions, conversions, constructions, etc
 are considered
 shabd varnon yaa aksharon ke sarthak samooh ko kehete hai
 According to grammar, there are two types of words - vikari and avikari or avayya
 vikari shabdon ko chaar bhaagon main baanta gaya he- sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya
 There are also four types of non-invariant words or avayya - adverbs, afferents, conjunctions, and exclamations, thus making the following 8 types of distinctions: kisi bhi sthaan, vyakti, vastu aadi kaa naam bataane vaale shabd ko sangya kehete hai
 Examples - sangya ke bhed- a total of 5 distinctions of the noun are explained
 sangya ke badale main aane vaale shabd ko sarvnaam kehete hai
 Examples - sangya ke sthaan par prayukt hone vaale shabd ko sarvnaam kehete he
 The pronoun is used not to repeat the noun
 jaise - main, tu, tum, aap, vah, ve aadi
 personal pronoun
 sarvnaam ke bhed There are six types of pronouns
 purushavachak sarvnaam The pronoun which is used by the speaker or writer for himself or herself, is called a 'masculine pronoun'
 purushavachak sarvnaam teen prakaar ke hote hai- Definitive pronoun jo sarvnaam kisi vyakti, vastu aadi kii ore nishchaypurvak sanket karen ve nishchayvachak sarvnaam kehalaate hai
 For example, the words 'this', 'that', 'those' are pronouncing definitively to a particular person, so they are definitive pronouns
 udhaaharan- Indefinite pronoun jin sarvnaam shabdon ke dwaara kisi nishchit vyakti athwa vastu kaa bodh na ho ve anishchayvachak sarvnaam kehalaate hai
 Such as 'someone' and 'some' etc
 pronoun words
 inase kisi vishesh vyakti athwa vastu kaa nishchay nahin ho rahaa he
 Therefore, such words are called indefinite pronouns
 udhaaharan- Relative pronouns paraspar sabandh batalaane ke liye jin sarvanaamon kaa prayog hota he unhen sambandhvaachak sarvnaam kehete hai
 Like- 'joe', 'he', 'whose', 'his', 'like', 'such' etc
 udhaaharan- Interrogative pronoun jo sarvnaam sangya shabdon ke sthaan par bhi aate he or vaakya ko prashnvachak bhi banaate hai, ve prashnvachak sarvnaam kehalaate hai
 Like what, who etc
 udhaaharan- reflexive pronouns jahaan swayan ke liye ‘aap’, ‘apana’ athwa ‘apane’, ‘aap’ shabd kaa prayog ho vahaan nijvachak sarvnaam hota he
 Among these, the words 'apna' and 'aap' are the best, male middle men and other men who are making knowledge of themselves, which are called personal pronouns
 vishesh- Where the word 'you' is used for the listener, it is a respectable middle man and where the word 'you' is used for himself, it is private
 udhaaharan- Special use of pronoun words sangya yaa sarvnaam kii visheshta bataane vaale shabd ko visheshan kehete hai
 Examples - visheshan ke bhed1,sankhyavachak visheshan 2, quantitative adjectives 3,gunavachak visheshan 4, pronouns kaary kaa bodh karaane vaale shabd ko kriya kehete hai
 Examples - kriyaayein do prakaar kii hotin hai- Transitive verb: The verb which has a karma is called transitive verb
 udhaaharan - khaanaa, pinaa, likhnaa aadi
 The monkey eats banana
 is vaakya main 'kya' kaa uttar 'kelaa' he
 Intransitive verb: There is no action
 udhaaharan - hansanaa, ronaa aadi
 The child cries
 is vaakya main 'kya' kaa uttar uplabdh nahin he
 Gender and duration of the verb: kriya kaa ling karta ke ling ke anusaar hota he
 Example - crying: the boy cries
 ladki roti he
 The boy used to cry
 ladki roti thi
 The boy will cry
 ladkee roegi
 The meaning of the sentence becomes more clear with the use of auxiliary verbs
 isse vaakya ke kaal kaa tathaa kaary ke jari hone, purna ho chukne athwa aarambh na hone ki sthiti kaa bhi pataa chalata he
 Example - The dog is barking
 
 The dog must have barked
 
 The word that describes the characteristic of any verb is called an adjective
 udhaaharan - Distinction of adjective: do shabdon yaa vaakyon ko jodne vaale sanyojak shabd ko samucchy bodhak kehete hai
 Examples - vismay prakat karne vaale shabd ko vismayadibodak kehete hai
 Examples - hindi main teen purush hote hai- The word man and us are used in Uttam Purush, in which we are used both singular and plural
 is prakaar ham uttam purush ekvachan bhi he or bahuvachan bhi he
 For example, if we say "we are all Indians", then here we are plural and if it is written that "we are skilled in the work of electricity", then here we are also in singular form and plural form Is also in hamako sirf tumse pyaar he - is vaakya main dekhen to, "ham" ekvachan ke rup main prayukt hua he
 The speaker also uses us as a singular to give value to himself
 lekhak bhi kai baar apane bare main kehane ke liye ham shabd kaa prayog ekvachan ke rup main apane lekh main karte hai
 Thus we also have a singular pronoun as a singular
 hindi main do vachan hote hai: There are only two genders in Hindi: female and male
 koi vastu yaa jaanavar yaa vanaspati yaa bhavvaachak sangya streeling he yaa pulling, iskaa gyaan abhyaas se hota he
 Sometimes it is also known by the endings of the noun
 8 kaarak hote hai
 All the words of any sentence can be classified into these 8 factors
 udhaaharan- ram ne amaruud khaaya
 Here ‘rama’ is the doer, ‘khana’ is karma
 do vastuon ke madhya sambandh bataane vaale shabd ko sambandhkaarak kehete hai
 Examples - ve shabd jo kisi duusare shabd ke armbh main lagaaye jate hai
 Applying these can change the meaning or specificity of the words
 pra+ mod = pramod, su + sheel = susheel Prefixes are paratantras by nature
 upsarg chaar prakaar ke hote hai - Words that are added to the end of a word are called suffixes
 jaise- gaadi + vaan = gaadiwan, apana + pen = apnaapan When two words are close together, to combine them is called a treaty
 jaise- surya + udai = suryoday, ati + aavashyak = atyaavashyak, sanyasi = sam + nyaasi, ravi + indra = rabindra The two words together form an entire term
 jaise-raaj+putr = raajputr, chote+bade = chote-bade aadi samaas chha: hote hai: Duality, Dwigu, Tatpurush, Karmadhyara, Avayabhav and Bahubrihi vaakya vichaar hindi vyakaran kaa teesraa khand he jisamen vaakya kii paribhaasha, bhed-upbhed, sanrachana aadi se sambandhit niyamon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 a group of words that makes full sense, is called a sentence
 vaakya ke do anivaary tatva hote hai- What is talked about is called objective and what is talked about is called predicate
 udhaaharan ke liye mohan prayag main rahata he
 It has an objective - Mohan and Vyayat - lives in Prayag
 vaakya bhed do prakaar se kiye ja sakate han- There are eight types of sentences based on the meaning - 1-vidhaan vaachak vaakya, 2- nishedhvachak vaakya, 3- prashnvachak vaakya, 4- vismyadivachak vaakya, 5- ajnavachak vaakya, 6- ichhavachak vaakya, 7- ndehvachak vaakya
 Sentences can be in any of three tenses: padbandh do shabdo kaa sangyojan hai "pad + bandha
 Before knowing the phrase, it is important to know what is the verse or verse introduction
 (pad: jis shabd kaa pura vyakaran kii parichay dena hota he jaise shabd kaa vachan kya he, ling kya he, kriya he yaa phir kriya visheshan, sangya shabd hai yaa phir sarvnaam shabd he aadi kii puri jaankaree de use pad kehete he

 keval jammu evam kashmir, junagarh tathaa hyderabad ke raajaaon ne aisa karnaa nahin sweekaara
 When there was a lot of protest against the Nawab of Junagadh, he fled to Pakistan and Junagadh also got into India
 jab hyderabad ke nizaam ne bharat main vilay kaa prastaav asweekaar kar diya to sardaar patel ne vahaan sena bhejkar nizaam kaa aatmasamarpan kara liya
 But Nehru kept Kashmir with him, saying that this problem is an international problem
 
 There was a difference of sky between the first Prime Minister of independent India, Pt
 Nehru and the first Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Patel
 yadhyapi donon ne england jaakar baristary kii degree praapt kii thi parantu sardaar patel vakaalat main pan nehru se bahut aage the tathaa unhone sampoorn british samrajya ke vidhyaarthiyon main sarvapratham sthaan praapt kiya tha
 Nehru often used to think, Sardar Patel taxed him
 nehru shastron ke gyaata the, patel shastron ke pujari the
 Patel too had a higher education but he did not have even a little ego
 ve swayan kaha karte the, "maine kala yaa vigyaan ke vishaal gagan main oonchi udaanen nahin bharin
 My development has taken place in the land of poor farmer's in raw huts and in the dirty houses of cities
 " pan nehru ko gaanv kii gandagi, tathaa jivan se chidh thi
 Pt
 Nehru was interested in international fame and wanted to become the Socialist Prime Minister
 desh kii swatantraaa ke pashchaat sardaar patel up pradhanmantri ke saath pratham grih, soochna tathaa riyasat vibhaag ke mantri bhi the
 Sardar Patel's greatest gift was to build Indian unity by merging 562 big and small princely states into the Indian Union
 vishwa ke itihaas main ek bhi vyakti aisa na hua jisane itani badi sankhya main rajyon kaa ekikaran karne kaa saahas kiya ho
 On 5 July 1947 a princely department was established
 ek baar unhone suna ki bastar kii riyasat main kachche sone kaa bada baari kshetra he or is bhoomi ko dirghakaalik patte par hyderabad kii nizaam sarkaar khareednaa chaahati he
 The same day he got upset
 unhone apana ek thilaa uthaaya, ve

 menon ko saath liya or chal pade
 He reached Orissa, told the 23 kings there, "don't be a frog of a well, come into the ocean
" " urisa ke logon kii sadiyon puraani ichha kuch hi ghanton main puri ho gai
 Then reached Nagpur, met 38 kings from here
 inhen sailyut state kaha jaataa tha, yani jab koi inase milane jaataa to top chhodkar salaami di jaati thi
 Patel gave the last salute to the king of these states
 isi tarah ve kathiyawad pahunche
 There were 250 princely states

 Integrated everything
 ek shaam mumbai pahunche
 Talked to the surrounding kings and put their kingship in their bags and went

 Sardar Patel, while rolling his red pencil on the map of Faridkot, only asked "what is the will?" The king trembled
 aakhir 15 agast 1947 tak keval teen riyaasaten-kashmir, junagarh or hyderabad chhodkar us louh purush ne sabhi riyasaton ko bharat main mila diya
 Junagadh was merged into these three princely states on 9 November 1947 and the Nawab of Junagadh fled to Pakistan
 13 navambar ko sardaar patel ne somnath ke bhagn mandir ke punarnirmaan kaa sankalp liya, jo pandit nehru ke teevr virodh ke pashchaat bhi bana
 In 1948, Hyderabad was also annexed by only 4 days of police action
 na koi bam chalaa, na koi kranti hui, jaisaa ki daraaya ja rahaa tha
 As far as the princely state of Kashmir is concerned, it was taken by Pandit Nehru in his own right, but it is true that Sardar Patel was very angry at the referendum in Kashmir and taking the issue of Kashmir to the United Nations
 ni:andeh sardaar patel dwaara yah 562 riyasaton kaa ekikaran vishwa itihaas kaa ek aashcharya tha
 This was the bloodless revolution of India
 mahatma gandhi ne sardaar patel ko in riyasaton ke bare main likhaa tha, "riyasaton kii samasya itani jatil thi jise keval tum hi hal kar sakate the
 " yadhyapi videsh vibhaag pan nehru kaa kaaryakshetra tha, parantu kai baar up pradhanmantri hone ke naate cabinet kii videsh vibhaag samiti main unka janaa hota tha
 If the benefit of his foresight was taken at that time, then many current problems would not have arisen
 1950 main pandit nehru ko likhe ek patr main patel ne china tathaa uski tibet ke prati niti se saavdhaan kiya tha or china kaa ravaiya kapatpurna tathaa vishwasghaatee batalaaya tha
 In his letter, China was called its enemy, its behavior indecent and the language of China's letters not that of a friend, but the language of future enemy
 unhone yah bhi likhaa tha ki tibet par china kaa kabja nai samasyaon ko janm degaa
 Pt
 Nehru did not agree with the letters written in the context of Nepal in 1950
 1950 main hi goa kii swatantraaa ke sambandh main chali do ghante kii cabinet baithak main lambi vaarta sunne ke pashchaat sardaar patel ne keval itnaa kaha "kya ham goa jaaenge, keval do ghante kii baat he
 "nehru was very angry with this
 yadi patel kii baat maani gai hoti to 1961 tak goa kii swatantraaa kii pratiksha na kerani padati
 As the home minister, he was the first to Indianize Indian civil services and made them Indian Administrative Services
 angrejon kii seva karne waalon main vishwaas bharkar unhen rajbhakti se deshbhakti kii ore modaa
 Had Sardar Patel lived a few years, there would have been complete rejuvenation of bureaucracy
 sardaar patel jahaan pakistan kii chhadam va chaalaaki purna chaalon se satark the vahiin desh ke vighatnkaaree tatwon se bhi saavdhaan karte the
 In particular he was aware of the discrimination of Muslim League and Communists in India and their devotion to Russia
 anek vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki sardaar patel bismark kii tarah the
 But the London Times wrote "bismarck's successes remain insignificant to Patel
 yadi patel ke kehane par chalate to kashmir, china, tibet va nepal ke halaat aaj jaise na hote
 Patel was rightly conceived of Manu's rule
 unamem kautilya kii kootneetijyata tathaa maharaj shivaji kii doordarshita thi
 He was not only the Sardar but also the head of the heart of Indians
 nirantar sangharmpurn jivan jeene vaale sardaar patel ko swatantra rup se pustak-rachana kaa avkaash nahin mila, parantu unke likhe patron, tippaniyon evam unke dwaara diye gayi vyakhyanon ke rup main brihad sahitya uplabdh he, jinka sankalan vividh roopakaron main prakashit hote rahaa he
 The most important of these are the letters of Sardar Patel which have importance of the document in the context of freedom struggle
 1945 se 1950 i0 kii samyavadhi ke in patron kaa sarvapratham durga das ke sampadan main navajivan prakaashan mandir se 10 khandon main prakaashan hua tha
 Selected correspondences from this large compilation were also published in two volumes in the editing of V
 Shankar, whose Hindi translation was also published

 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha

 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset

 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe

 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed

 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army

 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion

 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army

 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin

 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira

 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya

 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it

 --HINDI TRANSLATION-- Sue Yunus appeared in Mecca and has one hundred and nine verses in it, i am in the name of God who has a great kindness, Alif Lam Ra, these verses belong to the book which is a great deal for the people
 One of the same people sent to the same person to scare people and tell honest people the good news that for them there is a high standard in the barrage of their family
 It seems that it is not at all that your family is the same God who created all the sky and the land in 6 days, then he exalted happiness, he arranges every work, no one recommends it, but after his permission, the same God
 If you are a family, then pray for the same, do you still not pay attention, you all have to return to the same, the promise of God is true
 He will then live again so that those who accepted Iman and Those who have done good deeds will be rewarded with justice, and for those who have done the kufr, the drinking water in the punishment of their kufr will be the boiling water and painful wonders
 He is the one who made the Aftab shiny and important and illuminated his destination
 It was decided so that you know the number of years and the account, God has made it in the nature of the truth and it is a matter of truth for the people Dar makes a statement that it is not at all unlike the day and night, and what God has created in the heavens and the earth, there are a lot of problems for the dieters, it is also not that the people who do not have our whereabouts and the life of the world
 He has taken a bath and is seated on the same and those who are guilty of our verses, they are the people whose whereabouts are worldly due to their deeds
 Neither did people Iman accepted and good acts Unhnen their Iman his Lord The destination will reach Maqsood that the canals will be released in the gardens of comfort and hope and under those gardens, those people will have only this Kaul, that you are a pak and a pakiza and in them, their outward peace will be with salute and their last conviction
 It will be that all the praise is for the God who is the cradle of the whole world and the way people are sitting in a hurry for their own good
 If i hurried in evil, then when would his death have come to him, but we do not leave those people who do not want to be harmed by us, that he will be the leader in his government and when any harm is touched to the human being
 On his aspect or sitting or standing, he calls us, then when we remove his suffering from him, it slips as if he called us for the trouble which reached him
 People who transgresses their Karastaniya simply do them good Have been shown and when you invited the first Ummahs, we definitely shooed them, although their Rasul had brought the Waja and the Roshni Mojjat and those people did not believe that we punished the guilty people like that again
 After that, you have made us alive in the ground so that we can see how you work and when our illuminations are read in front of those people, those people who are our Jury is not knocked
 He says that in front of us i am afraid of another day's wonder, say that if God wanted me, i would not read this in front of you nor would he warn you because i have had issues before this
 Do you not understand that if the person who lies on God or falsely confesses to it, who else will be guilty, it is not possible that the crime is not successful Do or people except Allah is Prsatis of something which is not their loss You can reach out and say that these people will be our referrals here, but if you say, do you inform God of something which he neither finds in the hope nor in the land, these people make the thing his love It is clear and paternal than that and everyone was the same Ummah and if there was not a thing from your family in which the people are doing this, their decision will be decided i would have been told and say why no mojiza was offered on that Prophet, then you say that the mess is special only for God, so you too can wait and i am sure to wait with you and people After the trouble reached, when we tasted our own mercy, then i immediately started a fight with those people in our rectangles, you tell me that God is all in the picture Is faster than what you do He is the only God who makes you walk in the dry and the river, even when you are riding on the boat, and he took those people with the help of the Mufafik and people got a gust of wind on the troubled woman
 And there were waves coming from all sides and those people understood that now they are surrounded and then they pray to God for their devotion, that if you beat us from it So we will surely go through a lot of time, then when God destroys them, then those people start sobbing on the ground immediately, then it is on your life - the benefit of the life of the world is there, then finally you have to come back to us and we Some used to say that the idea of worldly life is just like water, that we rained it from the sky, then the greens of the land, which the people and the chapa eat, make your own Was canceled and embellish it went and got the farm stay longer on him Surely our command and surprise arrived at night or day, we made the field so neatly chopped that there was nothing in it, for the people who care and worry we used to tell the verses like that And God calls to the house of rest and directs those whom he wishes, to those who have done good in the world for the better and nothing more and not on their faces If the person has done wrong, and the people who have done bad things, then the punishment of the crime is equal to that and he will be charged with a crime
 It is that they will always be there in the day when they will gather everyone - then you will say to Musharkin that you and your family stay in your place, then we will divide them and theirs
 Rik tell them that you were not our Prsatis us and you In the meantime, it is enough to bear witness that we did not have the news of your misery there, every person who has done that before, will check and all of them will be brought back to the barn of their rightful owner, and all those who used to do Ephetra
 Everyone will walk away from them, you ask me, who gives you a living from the sky and the land or who owns the ears and eyes, and who Removes life from life and removes dead from life and who arranges for every soul, then immediately you will say that God says this, are you not afraid of this too? After all, what else are you leaving behind? You will be brought back and all those who used to do the eftera will go away from them
 If you ask them, who gives you a living from the sky and the land or who owns the ears and eyes, and who lives with the dead
 He removes and removes the dead from life and who arranges for every mother, then immediately you will say that God says this, are you not afraid of this too? Da if your true Lord again but the error after the right thing and then where are you going to go turn You will be brought back and all those who used to do the eftera will go away from them
 If you ask them, who gives you a living from the sky and the land or who owns the ears and eyes, and who lives with the dead

 It is fitted in motorcars; Kach yarn and textiles were manufactured in 1931 AD; In 1902, sheeting slabs began to be built by the 'libby Owens' and 'furcault' systems in the city of Pittsburgh, USA, and in Belgium
 pracheen bharat main bhi mahabharat, yajurveda samhita, ramayana or yogawasishth main kaach shabd kaa upyog kai jagah kiya gaya he
 In ancient India, materials made of rhinestone were considered to be exquisite items
 bharat main kai pradeshon main pracheen kaach ke tukade praapt hue hai
 The description of Indian kachha actually dates from the 16th century
 us samay yahan se anirmit kaach bahut adhik maatra main europe or uttari italy ko niryaat kiya jaataa tha; yahan tak ki kaach nirmaan ke liye rasinic padaarth bhi venice bheje jate the
 Glass bangles, vials and toys were manufactured in each province of India in the 19th century
 aadhunik bhartiya kaach udyog san 1870 se aarambh hua or san 1915 tak kitne hi kaach ke kaarkaane khole gaye, par ve sab asafal rahe
 In the First World War, the Indian slaughter industry received a lot of encouragement
 parantu yudhoparant bhartiya bazaar kaach ke videshi maal se bhar gaya, falswaroop kai bhartiya kaarkaane band ho gaye
 The Government of Uttar Pradesh organized a committee to investigate and promote the kachch industry and its recommendations were recognized by the government
 usee samay se kaach udyog main tivrata ke saath unnati ho rahi he or ab bharat main kaach kii sab prakaar kii vastuon kaa nirmaan aadhunik dhang se ho rahaa he
 Nowadays, all the work of making glass is done by machines
 ucch taap par kaanch kii shyanta itani kam hoti he ki usko hawa bharke kisi aakaar main dhaala ja sake, par ye itnaa taral bhi nahin hota ki pani kii tarah bah jaye
 This process is called glass blowing and can be made of different shapes
 aadhunik vaigyanik bhashaa main 'kaach' shabd se Fluid movement is the actual action; Only the electrical and optical properties of a liquid glass are the same in all conditions
 drav kaach ko thanda karne par usamen shyanta badhati he or dhire-dhire bina kaachiya gunon kaa saadhaaran thos kaach ban jaataa he
 Several types of raw materials are liquefied at different temperatures, mixing in different quantities, as used to make the kach
 dravit kaach ko siliketon tathaa boreton kaa parsparik vilyan kaha ja saktaa he
 According to the temperature in this solution, many components are released into the oxides
 vilyan main ve atirikt oxide bhi hote hai, jo rasinic yogikon ke nirmaan kii aavashkataaon se adhik maatra main hote hai
 Kach can also be called a 'superheated' fluid, because kach changes gradually from the liquid state to the solid state, and the solid Kach has all the physical properties of its liquefaction, such as heat conductivity, etc
 kaach nirmaan ke liye mukhya padaarth silica he or yah prakruti main mukt avasthaa evam silicket yogicon ke rup main paaya jaataa he
 In nature silica is mostly found in the form of quartz
 iskaa vishuddh rup billore pathar he
 The most suitable materials for construction of sand are sand, sandstone and quartzite rocks
 yadi paane kii suvidha, prapya maatra or dhulaai baraabar ho to baaluu hi sabase upyukt padaarth he
 The most suitable sand manufacturing is sand containing at least 99 percent silica content and iron as ferric oxide is less than 0
1 percent
 baaluu ke kan bhi 0
5-0
25 millimetre ke vyas ke hon
 The sand is also washed by water to produce good mud
 elahabaad main shankargarh or vargarh ke baaluu ke nikshep kaach nirmaan ke liye ati uttam hai or uttar pradesh sarkaar ne vahaan par baaluu dhone ke kuch yantra bhi laga die hai
 It is also very important to have some alkaline substances such as soda ash for making simple sachets
 is mishran se dravanank kam or dravan kriya saral ho jaati he
 The water that is formed by the dissolution of these two substances is known as water tank, because it is water soluble
 kaach ko sthaayee banane ke liye koi dwisamakshareey oxide jaise calcium oxide yaa sis oxide ko bhi milaanaa padataa he
 According to the chemical law, the more substances added, the lower the liquid content
 prayek padaarth kaach main kuch vishesh gun utpann karata he or in gunon ko hi dhyaan main rakhte hue kaach ke mishran banaae jate hai
 Cassium oxide provides chemical stability to the sachets, but in excess, the sludge has a tendency to grow
 saadhaaran kaach baaluu, soda or chuunaa ke mishran se banaaya jaataa he
 Lime or limestone is added to the kach mixture for calcium oxide
 boric amla yaa suhaaga se kaach main vishesh bhautik gun utpann ho jate hai, jaise nune prasar-gunank or adhik tanaav sahansheeltaa, tapiya sahan shakti evam adhik jal-pratirohakata
 Due to these properties, in the manufacture of accidental heat conversion items such as thermometer hose, lantern chimney and cooking utensils, the maximum amount of boric oxide and the amount of alkali are kept to a minimum
 sodium corbonate ke sthaan main anya kshar jaise potacium carbenet kaa bhi upyog vishesh kaachon main kiya jaataa he
 Often alkali is used as sulfate salts
 sis oxide ke liye adhiktar laal sis kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This oxide increases both the density and spacing of the sachets, and for this reason, such sludge is used in the manufacture of optical greens, hygienic and drinking vessels and artificial gems
 sisayukt kaach sheeghra hi kaate or paalish kiye ja sakate hai
 Potash alkali leaded sachets are the most luminous
 aluminium oxide, adhiktar felspar dwaara kaach main sammilit kiya jaataa he
 This oxide increases heat spread, hardness, durability, elasticity, tensile strength, luster and acid resistivity in the sludge
 iske dwaara kaach main samaangta or vaigyanik kaaryon main upyogi anya gunon kii vruddhi hoti he
 This reduces the diffusion coefficient of the oxide glass and the softening temperature
 yah vikachan ko roktaa he or iske prayog se kaach kaa dravan or shodh saral ho jaataa he
 Zinc oxide is often added to the slurry by zinc carbonate
 yah padaarth kaach ke prasar gunank ko bahut kam karata he
 It is used in the manufacture of chemical slabs because of its high stability in the slurry and less heat generated diffusion
 kuch kaachon main magnesium yaa barium oxide bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Some substances are added to the kach for the purpose of producing special chemical properties
 sis yukt kaachon main kuch oxykaarak padaarth, jese potacium nitrate yaa shora kaa hona aavashyak hota he
 Many small bubbles of gas, which are called 'seeds', get trapped in the gas when it is liquefied
 kaach ko inase mukt karne ke liye kuch rasinic padaarthon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 These substances become gases in the liquid slurry and bring the seeds out of the slice with them
 in padaarthon ko 'shodhak dravya' kehete hai
 Generally, carbon ammonium salt or arsenic is used for purification
 aalu, chukundar or bhigi lakdi ke tukade dravit kaach main daalkar bhi kahin-kahin kaach kaa shodhan kiya jaataa he
 Kach is used in many types of commodities that require different physical properties
 kaach ke bhautik gunon main bhinnata vibhinn oxidon dwaara laai ja sakati he
 The physical properties also depend on the relative quantity of each oxide present in the pot
 ghanatv- kaach main sabase adhik ghanatv sis oxide dwaara aata he or sabase kam boric oxide dwaara
 Electrical properties- The electrochemicality of a kach is dependent on its composition, temperature and atmosphere
 aajkal kaach kaa upyog achaalak ke liye bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Thermal properties - The heat is transmitted when heated, but there is minimal diffusion of boric oxide and magnesium oxide and maximum expansion from alkaline oxide
 ushma chaalakata- kaach ushma kaa adham chaalak he; silica tathaa boric oxide se kaach main ushma-chaalakata kam hoti he
 Other physical properties of the sachets, such as Young's coagulation coefficient, stress strength, firmness and thermal tolerance, depend on the oxides contained in the sachets
 kaach main inke prabhaav kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karke rasinic kaach, ushmapratirohak kaach, jo laal tapt kar ekadam barf main thande kiye ja sakate hai or tapamapi kaach kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he

 jis oonchaai se gole ko giraane par kaach main darar pad jaae vah oonchaai kaach kii pushtataa kii maatrik maap hoti he
 To test the confirmation of the bottles, the water pressure is gradually increased by filling the water inside the bottles so that the bottles are burst
 tapiya sahansheeltaa- achaanak taap parivartan kii us maatra ko, jise kaach bina toote sahan kar sake, kaach kii tapiya sahansheeltaa kehete hai
 To test this property, the items of the kachha are heated to various temperatures in water and suddenly dipped in ice cold water
 pashcharikaran, bhojan banane ke bartan, lamp kii chimaniyaan, rasinic kaach or tapamapi kii nalee ke liye, ucch tapiya sahansheeltaavale kaach kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In order to produce greater thermal tolerance in the sachets, the amount of silica must be higher and the amount of alkali should be reduced and the sachets should also contain some amount of zinc oxide, boron oxide and aluminum oxide
 prakaashiya gun- lenson main prakaashiya gun, jaise ucch vartanaank evam vikshepan bhi, kaach main bhinn oxidon kii matraaon par nirbhar hai or isliye sis oxide, barium oxide or calcium kii matraaon ko ghataakar badhaakar prayek bhanti ke vishesh vartanaank or vikshepan ke bahumoolya kaach taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 For the transduction of ultraviolet light, the glaze of transdermide is made of mastic silica, as these springs cannot penetrate through ordinary mercury; But they can easily go beyond liquid quartz
 shyanta- kaach nirmaan main shyanta bhi ek aavashyak gun he, kyonki kaach kaa dhaman, peden, karshan or belanaa, bahut kuch kaach kii shyanta par hi nirbhar rahete hai; abhitaapan main vikruti ko hataanaa bhi shyanta se hi sidhaa sambandhit he
 The viscosity of the sachets depends on the oxide content of the sachets
 silica kii maatra badhaane se kaach kaa shyanta-paraas bad jaataa he; chooney kii vruddhi se shyanta badhati he, parantu shyanta-paraas kam hota he
 Viscosity decreases with increasing soda content, but viscosity increases
 jab kaach kii vastu ko garam kiya jaataa he to baahar kii sataha bheetar ke bhaagon ke apeksha adhik garam ho jaati he or isi prakaar jab tapt dravit kaach ko thanda karke thos kiya jaataa he tab thos hote samay kaach ke baahar kii sataha bheetar kii apeksha adhik thandi ho jaati he
 Due to the difference in temperature, there is uneven diffusion or shrinkage in the slag, which causes stress within it and corresponding distortions in the slag
 nirmaan ke samay kaach tapt rahata he, isliye thanda hone par kaach kii vastuon main pratibal or vikrutiyaan aa jaati hai
 The process of removing them is called the elimination of kach
 is vidhi main kaach kii vastuon ko phir se kaach ko komal honevaale taap se kuch kam taap par ek samaan tapt kar diya jaataa he
 This frees the kach from distortions due to change in viscosity
 tab kaach ko bahut dhire-dhire thanda kiya jaataa he
 This convergence-range also depends on the oxide content of the glass
 adhik ksharyukt kaach paryaapt nimna taap par abhithapit kiye ja sakate hai
 For complex sludge, such as chemical sludge heat resistant sachets, the absorbency heat is very high
 prakaashiya kaachon ke abhitaapan main bahut adhik sam lagata he; kyonki unako bahut dhire-dhire thanda karnaa hota he jinamein ve praaia: vikrutiheen hon
 It took more than a year to cool the kachha of the world's largest 200 inch diameter telescope
 jin kaach paatro main aushadhi, bhojan yaa peya rakhaa jaataa he, unke kaachon par bahut samay tak dravon kii rasinic kriyahone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 All chemical particles have to suffer corrosion of water, acid and alkali
 dwarwale evam prakaashiya kaachon ko rituksharan sahanaa padataa he
 Therefore, it is necessary that these muds have such properties that the aforesaid corrosion has minimal effect on them
 kaach kaa sthayitv kaach ke bhinn oxide avyavon kii matraaon par nirbhar he
 The best substances to increase durability are zinc oxide, followed by aluminum, magnesium, and calcium oxide
 kshar kii maatra adhik hane par kaach kaa sthayitv ghatata he
 Boric oxide increases the durability of the sachets by 12 percent and thereafter decreases the durability
 kshareey oxide ke sthaan main silica badhaane se bhi sthayitv main vruddhi aati he
 Different types of pigments are added to the mix to make colored slabs

 There are many beliefs among Hindus regarding the origin of Ganga
 ek manyata ke anusaar brahma ji ke kamandal kaa jal ganga naamak yuvati ke rup main prakat hua tha
 According to another legend, Brahma washed the feet of Vishnu with reverence and collected that water in his kamandal
 ek teesri manyata ke anusaar ganga parvaton ke raja himavan or unki patni minaa kii putree hai, is prakaar ve devi parvati kii bahan bhi hai
 It is definitely believed in every belief that he was brought up under the patronage of Lord Brahma in heaven
 kai varshon baad, sagar naamak ek raja ko jaadui rup se saath hazaar putron kii prapti ho gayi
 One day King Sagara performed a ritual for the prosperity of his empire
 ek ashv us anushthan kaa ek abhinn hissaa tha jise indra ne irshyaavash chura liya
 Sagara sent all his sons around the earth to search for that horse
 unhen vah patallok main dhyanamgn kapil rishi ke nikat mila
 Believing that the horse was stolen by the sage Kapil, they insulted him and dissolved his penance
 rishi ne kai varshon main pehali baar apane netron ko kholaa or sagar ke beton ko dekha
 With this view, all of them sixty thousand were burnt to ashes
 antim sanskaar na kiye jane ke kaaran sagar ke putron kii atmaaen pret banakar vicharne lageen
 When Bhagiratha, the son of Dileep and a descendant of Sagara heard of this misfortune, he vowed that he would bring Ganga to earth so that its water would wash away the sins of the sons of Sagara and get salvation
 bhageerath ne ganga ko prithvi par laane ke liye brahma ji kii tapasya kii
 Brahma ji agreed and ordered Ganga to go to earth and from there to Pataloka so that the descendants of Bhagiratha could attain salvation
 ganga ko yah kaaphi apmanjanak laga or usne tay kiya ki vah puure veg ke saath swarg se prithvi par giregi or use baha le jaayegi
 Then Bhagirath panicked and prayed to Shiva to reduce the velocity of the Ganges
 ganga puure ahankaar ke saath shiv ke sir par girane lagi
 But Shiva ji calmly tied him in his shoes and let only his small streams come out
 shiv ji kaa sparsh praapt karne se ganga or adhik pavitra ho gayi
 Going towards Pataloka, the Ganges created another stream to flow over the earth so that the unfortunate people could be saved
 ganga ekmaatr aisi nadi he jo teenon lokon main bahati he-swarg, prithvi, tathaa pataal
 Therefore in Sanskrit language it is called "tripathga"
 bhageerath ke prayaason se ganga ke prithvi par aane ke kaaran use bhagirathi bhi kaha jaataa he; or dussahsee prayaason tathaa dushkar uplabdhiyon kaa varnan karne ke liye "bhagirathi praytn" shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Ganga is also known as Jahnavi
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki prithvi par aane ke baad ganga jab bhageerath kii taraf bad rahi thi, uske pani ke veg ne kaaphi halchal paidaa kii or jaahnu naamak rishi kii sadhana tathaa unke kheton ko nasht kar diya
 Enraged by this, he drank all the water of the Ganges
 tab devataaon ne jaahnu se prarthana kii ki ve ganga ko chhod den taaki vah apane kaary hetu aage bad sake
 Pleased with his prayer, Jahnu allowed the Ganges water to flow through his ear
 is prakaar ganga kaa jahnavi" naam padaa
 It is believed that like the river Saraswati, by the end of the Kali Yuga, the Ganges will dry up completely and with that this era will also end
 uske baad satyuga kaa udai hoga
 According to Hindu texts such as the Skanda Purana, the goddess Ganga is Kartikeya's stepmother; Karthikeya is actually a son of Shiva and Parvati
 parvati ne apane shaareerik dosha se ganesh kii chhavi kaa nirmaan kiya, lekin ganga ke pavitra jal main doobane ke baad ganesh jivit ho uthe
 That is why it is said that Ganesha has two mothers - Parvati and Ganga and that is why they are also called Dwimatri and Gangeya

 The Hindu epic Mahabharata states that the Vasus cursed by Vasishta prayed to Ganga to become their mother
 ganga prithvi par avatarit huin or is shart par raja shantnu kii patni baniin ki ve kabhi bhi unase koi prashn nahin karenge, anyathaa vah unhen chhod kar chali jaaegi
 saat vasuon ne unke putron ke rup main janm liya or ganga ne ek-ek karke un sabko apane pani main baha diya, is prakaar unke shraap se unako mukti dilaai
 Until this time King Shantanu did not object
 antat aathven putr ke janm par raja se nahin rahaa gaya or unhone apni patni kaa virodh kiya, isliye ganga unhen chhodkar chali gayin
 Thus Dyus, born as the eighth son, survived by being trapped in a mortal body in human form and later became known as Bhishma, one of the most revered characters of the Mahabharata

 ganga nadi ke saath anek puranic kathaayen judi hui hai
 According to the legend and myths of King Sagara, Brahma is very interesting in addition to the stories of the birth of Ganga with the drops of sweat of the feet of Vishnu
 ek anya katha ke anusaar raja sagar ne jaadui rup se saath hajaar putron kii prapti kii
 One day King Sagara performed a yajna to conquer Devaloka
 yajna ke liye ghoda aavashyak tha jo irshyaalu indra ne chura liya tha
 Sagara sent all his sons in search of a horse
 Finally they found the horse in Hades, which was tied to a sage
 sagar ke putron ne yah soch kar ki rishi hi ghode ke gaayab hone kii vajah hai unhone rishi kaa apmaan kiya
 The sage, who was under penance, opened his eyes after thousands of years and with his anger all the sixty thousand sons of Sagar were burnt there
 sagar ke putro kii atmaaen bhoot banakar vicharne lage kyonki unka antim sanskaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 Sagar's son Anshuman unsuccessfully attempted to liberate souls, and later Anshuman's son Dileep too
 bhageerath raja dilip kii duusari patni ke putr the
 He cremated his ancestors
 unhone ganga ko prithvi par laane kaa pran kiya jisase unke sanskaar kii raakh gangaajal main pravaah kar bhatakati atmaaen swarg main ja sake
 Bhagiratha did austerity of Brahma to bring Ganga to earth
 brahma prasann huye or ganga ko prithvi par bhejne ke liye taiyaar huye or ganga ko prithvi par or uske baad pataal main jane kaa aadesh diya taaki sagar ke putron ke atmaaon kii mukti sambhav ho sake
 Then Ganga said that when i fall on the earth from such a height, how will the earth be able to bear so much velocity? Then Bhagiratha appealed to Lord Shiva and he stopped the velocity of the Ganges in his open jatas, opening a braid, causing the incessant current of the Ganges to flow to the earth
 vah dhara bhageerath ke peeche peeche ganga sagar sangam tak gai, jahaan sagar-putron kaa uddhaar hua
 At the touch of Shiva, the Ganges became even more holy and the earth became a center of great reverence for the people
 puraanon ke anusaar swarg main ganga ko mandakini or pataal main bhagirathi kehete hai
 In the Bharata dynasty there was a great king named Shantanu
 ek din ganga tat par akhet khelte samay unhen ganga devi dikhaai padi
 Shantanu wanted to marry her
 ganga ne ise is shart par sweekaar kar liya ki ve jo kuch bhi karengi us vishay main raja koi prashn nahin karenge
 Ganga had seven sons one after the other from Shantanu
 parantu ganga devi ne un sabhi ko nadi main phenk diya
 The king did not ask him any question about it
 baad main jab unhen aathvaan putr utpann hua to use nadi main phenkane ke viruddh shantanu ne aapatti kii
 Thus his promise given to Ganga broke and Ganga canceled her marriage and went to heaven
 jate jate unhone shantnu ko vachan diya ki vah swayan bachche kaa paalan-poshan kar bada kar shantanu ko lautaa dengi
 a cheerful beautiful maiden was born to Brahmadeva's kamandal

 One believes that after liberating the world from the demon sacrifice in the form of Vamana, Brahmadeva washed the feet of Lord Vishnu and filled this water in his kamandal
 duusare kaa sambandh bhagwaan shiv se he jinhone sangeet ke durupyog se peedit raag-raagini kaa uddhaar kiya
 When Lord Shiva sang a song in front of Narada Muni Brahmadev and Lord Vishnu, due to the effect of this music, Lord Vishnu's sweat started flowing, which Brahma filled him in his kamandal
 isi kamandal ke jal se ganga kaa janm hua or vah brahma ke sangrakshan main swarg main rahane lagi
 Ganga is not only a river, but a glorious river of Indian culture
 devanadi, jahnavi, vishnupada, shivashishdharini jaise koi 108 naam is nadi ke hai
 In 'maha Bhagwat', 'ganga Astottarshat Namavali' is found
