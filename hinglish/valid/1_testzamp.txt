apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at mutual d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance
 volpuru main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke krishna jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The book, written by Brigadier Naeem Ahmed Salik, former director of arms control and disarmament in Pakistan's strategic planning block, was published in 2009
 unhone isamen daawa kiya he ki pakistan dwaara parmaanu bam ke pareekshan kaa uddeshy dakshin asia main ek baar phir se samrik santulan ko behaal karnaa tha
 He has also revealed in this that the then Finance Minister of the country Sartaj Aziz opposed the testing of the atomic bomb
 neuroptera insecta shrenee ke antargat aanevaale kiton kaa ek varg he
 Insects of this class range from small to somewhat large-sized soft-bodied, often with exceptionally long antlers, bite-friendly Mukhang, undivided or bipedal or often emaciated ligula, and having two pairs of membranous wings of exactly the same size
 jab keet baithe rahete hai tab donon jode pankh udar ke upar chat kii bhanti sthit hote hai
 Veins are of the primitive manner, but they have many supporting veins and many fine veins, the abdomen is often devoid of anus
 larven maansaahaari hote hai
 The legs of the larvae are well developed and the body is flat and the mukhang is biting and sucking
 jaleey neuroptera main udariy jal gil hote hai
 The pupae are freely functional and the wings have complete bronchi
 neuroptera shrenee ke sabhi kiton main udne kii shakti bahut kam hoti he
 They feed on the Komlang pests or live on sweet weather
 inke larve vividh rachana evam prakruti ke hote hai, kintu ye sabhi maansaahaari hote hai
 Some of these species are aquatic
 jaleey jatiyon main ek yah visheshta he ki inke prayek udariy khand main sanchit udariy pravardhan hote hai
 The Neuroptera class is divided into two subclasses Megaloptera and Plenipenia
 is varg ke kareeb 4,300 se adhik spishizon kaa adhyayan ho chukaa he
 The pests of this subclass have a tendency to divide into two in the veins of the wing
 larva ke mukhang kaatane ke liye hote hai
 Megaloptera subclass is divided into two major families - is parivaar ke antargat kuch hi vansh or jatiyaan hai, jo sansar bhar main faili hui hai
 They differ from other neuroptera in that their hind wings are wide near the root and when they do not fly, the caudate area extends like a fan
 is parivaar ke keet jal ke nearesth patton, chattaanon athwa anya vastuon par andey dete hai
 Each pile of cialis has 200–500 eggs and Corridalis has up to 200–300 eggs
 andey belanaakaar or gadhe bhure rang ke hote hai
 Larvae come out of the eggs and enter the water
 sialis ke laaven talab, nahar athwa manthar jaldhara ke kichadaile tal main paae jate hai, kintu koridalis ke larva vegavati jaldhara ke pattharon ke neeche chhipe rahete hai
 All larvae of this family are predators and live on larvae of other species of insects and worms etc
 pupa avasthaa main koridalis jameen yaa kaai ityadi main kai inch neeche chalaa jaataa he tathaa vayask hone par jameen yaa kaai se baahar chalaa aata he
 Their entire life cycle is one year
 koridalis uttari america or asia main paaya jaataa he
 This family includes all the typical overland members of Megaloptera
 This insect family is found in all continents except Australia
 is parivaar ke 80 se adhik spishiz kii jaankaree praapt he
 Pests of the family Raphididae are found in wild areas, on flowers and tree trunks etc
 ande ped kii chaal kii daraaron main lambey andnikshepak dwaara ghused die jate hai
 Larval loose ulcers are especially found in conifers
 ye ati bhukkhad hote hai or komal sharirawale kiton ko pakadakar unka shikaar karte hai
 The pupa is a closed type of opening and after some time it becomes active and creeps up vigorously until a suitable place to rest is available and remains there till it becomes an adult
 sarp makkhiyaan iskaa udhaaharan hai
 Under this, the tendency to divide into two classes of veins along the edge of the veins is obvious
 larvaon ke mukhang chooshak prakruti ke hote hai
 Examples of this subclass are Les Wing and Ant Huntsman
 adhikansh neuroptera planipenia ke antargat aate hai
 Almost all pleniphenia overland insects
 inamen se kuch larva avasthaa main lagbhag ubhaychar hote hai or ek yaa do vansh vastav main jaleey hai
 The larvae of plenipenia are widely predatory and are of special importance due to the destruction of aphid and other degrading insects
 planipenia upvarg nimnlikhit pariwaron main vibhajit he : The exclusive right to complete control of power or dominance over a geographical area or group of people is called sovereignty
 saarvbhaum sarvocch vidhi nirmaataa evam niyantrak hota he yani samprabhutaa rajya kii sarvocch shakti he
 The rise of the modern state in Europe resulted in the concept of 'sovereignty' in the seventeenth century
 madhya europe main europee rajshahiyon or samrajyon main satta raja, pope or saamanton ke bich banti rahati thi
 The decline of the recognition of the Catholic Church in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries led to the disintegration of feudalism and the rise of Protestant faith gave sovereign states a chance to flourish
 samprabhutaa kaa matlab he - 'sampoorn or aseemit satta'
 But its implications are not so simple
 mahaz is arth se yah pataa nahin chalata ki akhir is sampoorn satta kii sanrachana main kya-kya shaamil he? kya iskaa matlab kisi sarvocch vaidhanik praadhikaar se hota he yaa phir iskaa sambandh ek aisi raajnneetik satta se he jise chunauti na di ja sake? Due to similar disputes over the meaning of sovereignty, it has been understood since the nineteenth century by dividing it into two parts: legal sovereignty and political sovereignty
 is avadharana ko vyaavhaarik rup se aantarik samprabhutaa or bahya samprabhutaa ke taur par bhi grahan kiya jaataa he
 The internal version of sovereignty means the division of power within the state, the supreme power within the political system
 bahya sanskaran kaa taatpary he antarrashtriya vyavastha ke tahat rajya dwaara ek swatantra or swytt vajood kii tarah sakriy rah paane kii kshamta kaa pradarshan
 The concept of sovereignty is also rooted in the basis of modern nation and nationalism
 rashtriya swatantraaa, swa-shashan or samprabhutaa ke vichaaron ke mili-jule prabhaav ke bina a-upniveshikaran ke us silsile kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati jiske tahat dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke baad asia, africa or laathini america main bade paimaane par naye rashtron kii rachana hui
 There is an intellectual history of the difference between legal and political sovereignty which has to be looked at to understand the differences between Jean Boaden and Thomas Hobbes
 bodaan ne apni rachana da sicks books of kaamanvil main ek aise samprabhu ke paksh main tark diya he jo khud kanoon banaata he, par swayan ko un kanoonon ke upar rakhata he
 According to this view, law means to run people on the orders of the sovereign
 iskaa matlab yah nahin bodaan yahan kisi nirankush shaasha kii vakaalat karnaa chaahate the
 He believed that the sovereign ruler who made and complied with the law would be subject to a higher law
 yani loukik shaasha ke praadhikaar par daivi kanoon kii muhar zaruri hogi
 Contrary to Bodan's view, Hobbes in his composition Leviathan describes the idea of sovereignty not in terms of authority, but in terms of power
 hobbs se pehle saint augusteen ne ek aise samprabhu kii zarurat par bal diya tha jo maanavtaa main antarnihit naitik buraaiyon ko kaabo main rakhega
 Further developing this logic, Hobbes, while defining sovereignty as a monopoly on the oppressive power, recommended that this power should be in the hands of the ruler alone
 haalaanki hobbs nirbaadh rajshahi ko praathamikta dete the, par ve yah maanane ke liye bhi taiyaar the yah satta shaskaon ke ek chote se gut yaa kisi loktantric sabha ke haath main bhi ho sakati he
 This debate between Bodas and Hobbes suggests that legal sovereignty rests on state law as paramount
 iske vipareet raajnneetik samprabhutaa satta ke vaastavik vitaran se judi hui he
 Despite this difference, one also has to believe that the practical notion of sovereignty has legal aspects as well as political aspects
 aadhunik rajyon kii samprabhutaa kanoon kii sarvoparita par bhi nirbhar he or us kanoon kaa anupaalan karwaane vaale sattamulak tantra par bhi jiske paas damankaaree mashinari hoti he
 No law applies merely on the basis of moral obligations
 dand dene vaali vyavastha, police, jail or adaalaton ke bina use kaayam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This equation of legal and political sovereignty seems to be effective on both sides
 kanoon ko apane anupaalan ke liye agar satta ke tantra kii zarurat he, to satta ko apni vaidhata ke liye kanoon kii sanstuti kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Governance has to be lawful and constitutional, only then its legitimacy is maintained
 keval raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke dam par taanashaah sarkarein hi kaam karti hai
 If the government is democratic then its oppressive machinery has to remain accountable before the courts by staying within the boundaries of law
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik swaroop ke prashn par raajnneetik siddhant ke daayaron main kaafii bahes hui he
 After all, what should be the place of supreme and unlimited power? Would it be better to place it in the hands of one ruler or would it be better to have its center vested in a representative institution? In the seventeenth century, Emperor Louis Fourteenth of France told Darp that i am the kingdom
 ek vyakti ke haath main samprabhutaa dene ke peeche tark yah he ki us surat main samprabhutaa ke avibhajya hone kaa guarantee rahegi
 His expression will be in one voice and no other authority will interfere in it
 samprabhutaa kii is sarvasattavadi dharna main prabhaavshaalee hastkshep attharahavin sadi main kiya gaya jab jyaan-zaak ruso ne lokapriy samprabhutaa kii avadharana pesh kii
 Russo, rejecting the rule of the monarchy, wrote in his composition Social Contract: 'man is born free, but everywhere he is held in chains
 ’ darasal, soshal kantrect aadhunik raajnneetik darshan ko ekadam nayaa rup de detii he
 Their social agreement is different from Hobbes and Locke's social settlement
 ruso se pehle ke darshanikon kaa yakeen tha ki manushya apni buddhigat kshamtaaon ke kaaran duusare praaniyon se bhinn he, jabaki ruso maanate hai ki insaan naitik chunaav kii kshamta ke kaaran alag he
 If he is not given the freedom to make this election, he will be nothing more than a slave
 chunki samaaj tarah-tarah kii a-swatantraaaon se bharaa hua he or manushya apni prakritik swatantraaa ke shuruaati sansar main nahin laut saktaa, isliye ruso tajaviz karte hai ki use apni us azaadi kaa vinimay naagarik swatantraaa se karnaa chahie
 For this, human beings will have to form associations with each other, social existence will be created under which all people will relinquish their rights and in turn get rights as citizens, will remain as members of one sovereign
 arthath ek samvidhan bananaa padegaa jiske tahat har vyakti adheen bhi hoga or sahabhaagi naagarik bhi
 Only this way freedom can be guaranteed
 yah loktantr kii avadharana thi, par ruso janata ke pratinidhiyon dwaara chalaaye jane vaale loktantr yaa vidhi-nirmaan se sahamat nahin the
 Like the direct democracy of ancient Greece, Rousseau wanted all citizens to congregate in a public place and formulate a law
 alpamat ko bahumat dwaara liye gayi nirnay ke adheen hone se bachaane ke liye ruso ne sarvasammati kaa paksh liya jise kargar banane ke liye unhone apane sabase vikhyath siddhant ‘jan-ichha’ kaa sutrikaran kiya
 Following the law created on the basis of 'public will' meant to follow one's own will
 ruso dwaara pravartit ‘jan-ichha’ kaa siddhant aage chal kar aadhunik loktantric siddhant kaa aadhaar bana
 Rousseau envisioned a comfortable community of citizens who would be the bearers of equality and unity beyond high-altitude relations, so he believed that it would be easy to provide 'public will' among them
 lekin ruso kabhi is prashn kaa uttar nahin de paye ki nagarikon kii aam sabha main vyakt kii jane vaali ichchhaaon main se ‘jarnal-vil’ kaise niklegi
 Therefore, in the end, they were seen saying that if 'people's will' is not available, then the will of the majority should be considered synonymous
 samprabhutaa ke siddhant ko udaarataavaadi-loktantric vichaar ke pairokaron ne aade haathon bhi liya he
 He says that the notion of sovereignty is unnecessary in the context of pluralistic and democratic governance
 ye log samprabhutaa ke vichaar ko uske sarvasattavadi ateet se peedit or isliye avaanchhneeya maanate hai
 He says that democratic governments are not run by the allegedly lawful regime imposed by the oppressive machinery
 ve to niyantran or santulan ke sameekaran or uske aadhaar par bane network ke zariye shashan karti hai
 Indeed, in modern states with a federal character, it is very difficult to determine the center of internal sovereignty
 sanyukt rajya america, canada, osterelia or bharat jaise sanghatmak rajyon main sarkaar do staron main vibhajit he or prayek str ke paas apane swytt adhikaar hai
 Sovereignty in such states emerges as a partnership between the center and the periphery
 aisi paristhiti main agar koi avibhajit samprabhu he to vah he samvidhan jo centre ko bhi samprabhutaa sampann banaata he or rajyon ko bhi
 External sovereignty signifies the status of a state in the international system
 is tarah kii paristhitiyaan bhi hoti hai ki kisi rajya main aantarik samprabhutaa par vivaad chalata rahata he, par antarrashtriya kshetra main uski bahya samprabhutaa kaa aadar kiya jaataa he
 Anyway, in the era of democracies, issues of internal sovereignty are no longer considered so important, but the question of external sovereignty has become more important than ever
 aise kai antarrashtriya vivaad hai jinamein ek desh kii samprabhutaa kaa daawa duusare desh kii taraf se apni samprabhutaa ke liye chunauti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The movement by the Palestinians for their sovereign nation is considered by Israel to be the cause of the decline of its sovereignty
