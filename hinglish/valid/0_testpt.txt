" "anuwaad ek shilp he jisamen ek bhashaa main likhit sandesh ke sthaan par duusari bhashaa ke usee sandesh ko prastut karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 " iske antargat nimna likhit paribhaasha ko uddhrut kiya jaataa he : "the process of transferring a product from one language or linguistic to another language or linguistic or its result is called translation
 " Under this comes the following definition: "anuwaad ek sambandh he, jo do yaa do se adhik paathon ke bich hota he; ye paath samaan sthiti main samaan prakaarya sampadit karte hai 
 " anuwaad kii paribhaashaon kaa yah vargeekaran jahaan anuwaad kii prakruti kii bahupaksheeyata ko spasht karata he, vahaan isse yah sanket bhi miltaa he ki, vibhinn uddeshyon ke anusaar anuwaad kii paribhaashaayen bhi bhinn-bhann ho sakati hai
 Thus all these definitions are valid
 in paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par anuwaad ke do paksh maane jate hai
 There are two sides to translation - first the operational side at the dynamic and the second theoretical aspect at the positional point
 sankriyaatmak drushti se anuwaad ek prakriya he
 The aspect of translation is related to the act of translation for which it is considered appropriate to use the word 'translation work'
 saiddhanthik drushti se anuwaad ek sambandh he jo do yaa do se adhik, parantu vibhinn bhashaaon ke paathon ke madhya hota he; parantu ve samanarthak hone chaiye
 This relationship is inaugurated by the study of comparative method
 in donon kaa samanvit rup is dharna main miltaa he ki anuwaad ek nishpatti he - kaary kaa parinaam anuwaad he - jo apane mul paath se paryaayta ke sambandh se judaa he
 The translation is called 'translated text' as a form of objection
 is drushti se ek mul paath ke anek anuwaad ho sakate hai
 In this way, where translation from an operational point of view is known as a mode of language use, in theoretical terms its relation is linked to the question of language relations based on techniques of language text comparison and contrast analysis
 anuwaad ko anuprayukt bhashavigyaan kii shakha kaha gaya he
 In fact, in its form, it is the connecting link of its process form and related form definitions, the operational basis of which is the translated text, the core of which is the notion of 'translation is a conclusion'
 in paribhaashaon se anuwaad ke vishay main jo anya jaankaree milti he, wein banduuvaar nimna prakaar se hai - Translation is from one language or language to another language or language distinction
 yah prakriya, parivartan, sthaanantaran, pratisthaapan, yaa punrariti kii prakruti kii hoti he
 The object to be transferred can be renumbered with different names, such as text, meaningful experiences, information, messages
 ye vibhinn naam anuwaad kii saiddhanthik prishthbhumi ke vibhinn yomon tathaa anuwaad kaary ke uddeshyon main antar se jude hai
 As such, the assurance expressed by the name linguistic 'textual content' is characteristic of the linguistic basis of translation, which is particularly used in machine translation
 'soochna' or 'sarthak anubhav' anuwaad ke samajabhashagat aadhaar kaa sanket karte hai; or ‘sandesh' se anuwaad kii pathasanketaparak prishthbhumi uplakshith hoti he
 The specialty of the above is that it has the same meaning in both languages
 yah arth kii samanta vyapak drushti se hoti he or bhashik arth se lekar sandarbhamulak arth tak vyaapt rahati he
 In short, the translation of a specific language of a particular language into another language in such a way as to translate it into another language, in which it implies the linguistic meaning of the original, the meaning derived from the characteristics of the application, the features of the application and style, the content, and the associated cultural features
 The second language reader seems naturally admissible while preserving
 beesvin sadi ko anuwaad kaa yug kaha gaya he
 Although translation is said to be one of the most ancient occupations or professions, it is not believed to have attained its importance in the twentieth century
 iskaa mukhya kaaran mana gaya he ki beesvin shatabdi main hi bhashasmpark arthath bhinn bhashabhashi samudaayon main sampark kii sthiti pramukh rup se armbh hui
 Its root causes are considered to be economic and political
 falswaroop, vishwa kaa aarthik-raajnneetik maanchitr parivartit hone laga
 In the present Yag, if one language is predominant in most of the nations, then one or more languages appear on the secondary post
 duusare shabdon main, ek hi raajnneetik-prashasnic ikai kii seemaa ke antargat bhashaayi bahusankhyak bhi rahete hai or bhashaayi alpsankhyak bhi
 In democracy, the right of all people to participate equally in administration is considered meaningful only when they are approached through their language
 isse bahubhashikta kii sthiti utpann hoti he or uske sangrakshan kii prakriya main anuwaad kaary kaa aashray lenaa anivaary ho jaataa he
 In addition to this, a new consciousness of the imperative and importance of translation work appears to be growing strongly due to the increasing exchanges between various nations at the international level, political, economic, scientific and technological, and literary and cultural levels
 atah anuwaad ek vyapak tathaa bahudhaa anivaary or tarksangat sthiti maani jaati he
 The importance of translation is understood more clearly in two different, but related contexts: social and practical importance, academic and cognitive significance
 saamaajik sandarbh main anuwaad vyapaar anaupchaarik paristhitiyon main hota he
 It is related to the state of bilingualism
 dwibhashikta kaa saamaanya arth he ek samay main do bhashaaon kaa vaikalpik rup se prayog
 There is a large part of the society of the present era, which uses the alternative of two languages in an informal state of social context
 saamaanya rup se prayek shikshit vyakti, nagareey parivesh kaa ardh shikshit vyakti, do bhinn bhashabhashi rajyon ke seemaa pradesh main rahane vaali janata, tathaa bhashaayi alpsankhyak, inamen adhik spasht rup se dwibhashikta kii sthi dekhi jaati he
 This bilingualism is usually of dependent / joint bilingualism
 jiskaa saamaanya lakshan yah he ki, sab ek bhashaa main sochate hai, parantu anya bhashaa main abhivyakt karte hai
 In this case it is mandatory to have the translation process
 parantu yah prakriya anaupchaarik rup main hi hoti he
 Individuals translate their mind from first language to other language and say their words
 yah mana gaya he ki, anya bhashaa parivesh main anya bhashaa sikhte samay anuwaad kaa pratyaksh rup se astitv rahata he
 If another language is learned in the self-language environment, a "code" change occurs, in which the state of translation becomes somewhat indirect
 atah dwibhashi rup main sabhi anuwaad anaupchaarik hai
 In this context, translation appears to play an important role in social language practice
 shaikshanik evam gyanatmak sandarbh main anuwaad vyapaar aupchaarik sthiti main hota he
 It has two distinctions: translation as means and translation as practicable
 saadhan rup main anuwaad kaa prayog bhashaa shikshan kii ek vidhi ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The practice of translation as a cognitive skill reinforces two skills of language learning - comprehension and expression
 isi prakaar saadhan rup main anuwaad ke do or kshetra hai : bhashaaon kaa tulanaatmak vyatireki adhyayan tathaa tulanaatmak sahitya vivechan
 In fact, it is through translation to study and analyze languages that a person knows what words mean in a sentence
 uske pashchaat hi vah donon main samanta tathaa asamanta ke bindu se avgat ho paata he
 Therefore, heterogeneous language analysis has also been called prescriptive analysis
 tulanaatmak sahitya vivechan main saahitiyon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan ke saadhan rup main anuwaad ke prayog ke dwaara sadrush-visadrush anshon kaa arthbodh hota he, jisase anshon kii tulana kii ja sake
 Apart from this, practicing translation of works of other language literature or / and reading them in translated form is an example of the contribution of translation in comparative literature discussion
 saadhy rup main anuwaad vyapaar anek kshetron main dikhaai padataa he
 Koshkarya is also a kind of translation work
 sambhashik kosh main ek hi bhashaa ke andar anuwaad hota he or dwibhashi kosh main do bhashaaon ke madhya
 This translation takes place on the dimension of language rather than text, affecting two levels of language analysis
 ve do str - shabd or shabd shrunkhla hai
 Similarly, translation-trade is also taken for the development of a language
 jab kisi bhashaa ko aise vyavhaar-kshetron main kaam karne kaa avasar miltaa he, jinamein pehle uskaa prayog nahin hota tha, tab use vishaywastu or abhivyakti paddati donon hi drushtiyon se viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 For this, various types of literature from other languages are translated into it
 falswaroop, vishaywastu kii paridhi ke vistaar ke saath-saath bhashaa ke abhivyakti-kosh kaa kshetra bhi vistrut hota he
 Many new words are formed, sometimes the prevailing words get new meaning, new synergies start to develop, hybrid-vocabulary is used, and due to the characteristic of the context of language use, a new distinction of language overall gets up
 aadhunik prashasnic hindi tathaa patrakarita hindi iske achche udhaaharan hai
 This process is called language planning and language development, which is part of the socio-economic development of the nation in its wider context
 is prakaar anuwaad ke madhyam se vikasshil bhashaa main aavashyak or mahatvapurn sahitya kaa pravesh hota he
 One can then say that translation in this form also contributes to national development
 apane vyapkatam rup main anuwaad bhashaa kii shakti main sanvardhan karata he, paathon kii vyakhya evam nirvachan main sahaayak he, bhashaa tathaa vichaar ke bich sambandh ko spasht karata he, gyaan kaa prasar karata he, samskruti kaa samvahak he, tathaa rashtron ke madhye paraspar avgaman or sadbhaav kii vruddhi main yogadan karata he
 In Goethe's words, translation is necessary and important, even if impossible
 anuwaad ke swaroop ke do ullekhneey paksh hai - samanvay or santulan
 The multidisciplinary dimension of translation theory is its coordinating aspect
 tadnusaar, yadhyapi anuwaad siddhanth kaa mul udgam he anuprayukt tulanaatmak pathaceketvigyaan, tathaapi use kuch anya shaastra bhi sparsh karte hai
 It is clear that the translation of 'comparative' is related to two languages, in which questions of equality and inequality of languages are present
 pathasanketavigyaan ke teenon paksh - arthvichaar, vaakyavichaar tathaa sandarbhamimasaa - anuwaad siddhanth ke liye praasangik hai
 In economics, there is a study of the relation between linguistic signs and linguistic reality
 sandarbhamimasaa ke antargat bhashaprayog kii sthiti ke sandarbh ke vibhinn ayaamon - vaktaa evam shrota kii saamaajik pahchaan, bhashaprayog kaa uddeshy tathaa sandesh ke prati vaktaa - shrota kii abhivritti, bhashaprayog kii bhautik paristhitiyon kii tathaa abhivyakti, madhyam aadi - kii mimasaa hoti he
 It is clear that the periphery of signology is wider than that of linguistics and broad communication such as translation work is suitable for the study of business
 anuwaad siddhanth ko sparsh karne vaale shastron main he sampreshan siddhanth jisaki manyataon ke anusaar anuwaad kaary ek sampreshan vyapaar he, tathaa tadnusaar us par ve sabhi baaten lagu hoti hai, jo sampreshan vyapaar kii prakruti main hai, jaise sampreshan kaa shatpratishat yathatath na hona, apurnataa, udriktata, aanshik kritrimata aadi
 From this, in place of word-per-word and meaning-per-meaning similarity in translation work, message-like similarity can also be justified
 sankriyaatmak drushti se ek paath yaa prokti anuwaad kaary kaa pravartan bindu hota he
 a text has its own structure, it can be tested by the concepts of linguistic co-operation and conceptual relevance
 iske atirikt ek paath ko bhashaprakayon kii akibhoot samshti ke rup main dekhte hue, usamen bhashaa-prayog shailion ke bhashaprakaryamulak vitaran ke vishay main adhik nishchit jaankaree praapt hoti hai
 Related to this is Sastra, Sociology and stylology, in which information about the distribution of styles of contextual linguistics along with the study of social dialects and applications is desirable for translation theory
 bhashaa se samandhit hone ke kaaran tarkshastra tathaa bhashadarshan bhi anuwaad siddhanth ko pusht karte hai
 According to logic, Satyamulya's examination of the translated text is the basis for purifying the correctness of the translation
 bhashadarshan main hone vaale arth sambandhi chintan se anuwaad kaary main arth ke antaran yaa uski punrariti se sambandhit samasyaon ko jaanane main sahaayta milti he
 Wittgenstein's belief is the 'use' of the word in the language
 anuwaad siddhanth ke liye is kaaran se vishesh praasangik he ki paath hi anuwaad kaary kii ikai he, jiskaa safal arthbodh anuwaad kii pehali aavashyaktaa he
 Thus, searching for the origin of meaning, linguistic meaning and linguistic position are essential parts of translation theory in the speech of the speaker
 arth ke antaran main jahaan uparyukt manyataon kii ek bhoomika he, vahaan arthgat dwibhashik samanta ke nirdhaaran main ghatakeey vishleshan kii paddati kii vishesh upyogita sweekaar kii gai he
 It is specially taken into consideration that where the nature of translation theory is formed from the relevant beliefs of various scriptures, translation theory itself is a special part of those scriptures
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa 'saamaanya' paksh bhi he or vishisht paksh bhi, or yah iskaa santulansheel swaroop he - saamaanya or vishisht kaa santulan
 According to the definition of translation, it is said that translation is practically at the level of specific linguistics and therefore theoretically at the level of common language - a distinction of English language journalism from English to Hindi language in Hindi of journalism
 tadnusaar, yugapad rup se anuwaad siddhanth kaa ek saamaanya paksh bhi he or vishisht paksh bhi
 What we say at the level of general, in practice, cites the specific level of linguistics
 'yathasambhav adhiktam paath prakaaron ke liye ek upyukt tathaa saamaanya anuwaad pranali kaa nirdhaaran' ye anuwaad ke kshetra sambandhit ek vichaarneey prashn mana jaataa he
 In relation to the determination of the system one has to consider the nature of the translation process, the different types of translation, the formulas for translation and the format for determining instructions for translation of different categories of texts, etc
 anuwaad kaa mukhya uddeshy, anuwaad kii ikai, anuwaad kaa kala-kaushal-vigyaan kaa swaroop, anuwaad kaary kii seemayen, aadi kuch anya vishay hai, jin par vichaar apekshit hota he
 The main language of translation work is the original language text
 isaki sanrachana, iskaa prakaar, bhashaprakarya praaroop ke anusaar mulpath kaa swaroop nirdhaaran, aadi ke saath shabdaarth-vyavastha evam vyakaranik sanrachana ke vishleshnatmak bodhan ke vibhinn praaroop, unki shaktiyon or simaaon kaa akalan, aadi ke sambandh main saiddhanthik charchaa tathaa inke sankriyaatmak dhaanche kaa nirdhaaran, iske antargat aane vaale mukhya bindu hai
 Some minor points are also discussed under the translation principle - which system should be adopted for translation of metaphors, proper nouns, terminology, initials, geographical names, trade names, names of business establishments, cultural words, etc
 ; What should be the form of translation system for literary works, scientific and technological writing, publicity literature, etc
 isi se sambandhit ek mahatvapurn bindu he, anuwaad kii vibhinn yuktiyaan - lipyantaran, shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad, shabdanugami anuwaad, aagat anuwaad, vyakhya, vistaran, sankshepan, saanskrithik paryaay, swabhaasheekaran aadi
 Ultimately, only one person does the work of translation
 ekaaki anuwaad main to anuvadak akelaa hota hi he, sahyogaatmak anuwaad main bhi, antim avadhi main, sampaadan kaa kaary anuvadak ko akele karnaa hota he
 Therefore, many responsibilities are attached to the translator and there are many expectations from him in the successful execution of the work
 bhashaa gyaan, vishay gyaan, abhivyakti kaushal, vyaktigat gun aadi kii drushti se anuvadak se hone vaali apekshaaon par vichaar karnaa hota he
 Translation education and translation review are two other important points
 anuwaad kii shiksha bhashaa-adhigam ke, vishesh rup se anya bhashaa adhigam ke, saadhan ke rup main di ja sakati he 
 In this, translation is subject to teaching, language-teaching and is planned in an intermediate short-term course, in which the steps and goals of teaching are clear and definite
 isamen shikshaarthi kaa lakshya bhashaa siikhnaa he, anuwaad karnaa nahin
 In the second phase of education, translation is practiced to learn translation as a craft or skill whose advanced stage is specified in the terminology of 'translation is art'
 is sthiti main jo bhashaa anuvadak kii apni nahin, uske adhigam ko bhi aanushangik rup main pusht karata jaataa he
 As practice material, lessons have to be followed according to the variety of text types and the amount of difficulty
 yadi ek sajaateey / vijaateey, swedashi yaa videshi bhashaa ko seekhney kii yojana main usase yaa usamen anuwaad karne kii kshamta ko viksit karnaa ek uddeshy ho to anuwaad-shikshan ke donon sopanon - sadhanparak tathaa sadhyaparak – ko anustarit rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Translation review is a part of the translation theory, which is behaved in a relaxed manner, even by a general reader of translated works, but who have a sufficiently clear theoretical background
 siddhantapusht anuwaad samiksha ek gyanatmak vyapaar he
 It reviews one or more translations of an original text, and the translation is evaluated by comparison of the original or by different comparisons of different translations of the original
 iske teen sopan hai - mulbhasha paath tathaa lakshyabhasha paath kaa vishleshan, donon kii tulana, or ant main lakshyabhashagat vishuddhta, upyuktata or swaabhaaviktaa kii drushti se anuwaad kaa moolyankan
 Various testing techniques are used to test the success of the translation on the step of the evaluation
 anuwaad ko kala or vigyaan donon hi roopon main swikaarne kii maansikta isi kaaran pallavit hui he ki sansarbhar kii bhashaaon ke parsparik anuwaad kii koshish anuwaad kii anek shaileyon or pravidhiyon kii ore ishaara karti hai
 One of the problems of translation is that a translation should be presented on the basis of literary genre
 yadi kisi naatak kaa naatak ke rup main hi anuwaad kiya jaae to aise anuwaadon main anuvadak kii apni sarjanaatmak pratibha kaa vaishishty bhi apekshit hota he
 a basis of translation is also dependent on the translation being prose or verse
 aisa paaya jaataa he ki adhikanshtah gadhy kaa anuwaad gadhy main athwa padya main hi upasthit ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi yah kram badla hua najar aata he
 The poetry of many prose works is found, while the translations of many poems are also available
 anuwaadon ko vishay ke aadhaar par bhi vargeekrut kiya jaataa he or kai staron par anuwaad kii prakruti ke anuroop use mul-kendrit or mulmukt do virgon main bhi baanta gaya he
 Among the meaningful and prevalent practices of translation, which have been mentioned by the translation scientists, the most acceptance of concordance, paraphrasing, paraphrasing, paraphrasing, interpreting, transliteration and conversion has been accepted
 strotbhasha ke prayek shabd kaa lakshyabhasha ke prayek shabd main yathavat anuvaadan ko shabdanuwaad kehete hai
 Verbatism based on 'maिकािकाika sthana maक्षिकाika' is actually the most inferior category of translation
 prayek bhashaa kii prakruti anya bhashaa se bhinn hoti he or har bhashaa main shabd ke anekanek arth vidyaman rahete hai
 That is why every phrase of the original language cannot be translated into the target language in the same way
 kai baar aise shabdanuvaadon ke kaaran badi haasyaaspad sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Translations made from Sanskrit to Hindi are sometimes tolerated due to the similarity of nature, but in the translation from European family languages, defects of meaning and hierarchy are commonly seen
 vastav main yadi strot or lakshyabhasha main arth, prayog, vaakya-vinyas or style kii samanta ho, tabhi shabdanuwaad sahi hota he, anyathaa yantrawat kiye gaye shabdanuwaad abodhgamy, haasyaaspad evam kritrim ho jate hai
 In such translators, the translation focuses its attention on the content or expression of the original language, regardless of the source language's words, phrase and syntax
 aise anuwaadon main strotbhasha kii bhav-saamagree ko upasthit karnaa hi anuvadak kaa lakshya hota he
 In the process of paraphrasing, sometimes the original splendor of the original form comes, but sometimes readers complain that the translator has presented the sense content according to the nature of the target language, without understanding the language of the original language
 jab pathak kisi rachana ko rachanaakaar ke abhivyakti-kaushal kii dashshti se padhanaa chahta he, to bhavanuaad uski lakshyasiddhi main sahaayak nahin hota
 In Sanskrit plays, there are frequent experiments that the Sanskrit shadow of the Prakrit language used by their women and servants, maids, etc
, also exists in the drama
 aise hi prayogon se chhayanuwaad kaa udbhav hua he
 Under the method of translation, the translator does not follow only the original words as in concordance, and not only follows the expressions, but also presents the subject in the target language in its shadow, completely bound to the original language
 is anuwaad main mulbhasha kii saamagree kaa sankshipt or atisankshipt anuwaad lakshyabhasha main kiya jaataa he
 This method is helpful in presenting translations of long speeches and debates
 aise anuwaadon main mulbhasha kii saamagree kaa lakshyabhasha main vyakhya sahit anuwaad upasthit kiya jaataa he
 In this, the translator interprets the contents of the original language with the requisite evidence and examples etc
, according to his study and approach
 lokmaanya tilak ne ’gita‘ kaa anuwaad is style main kiya he
 Many Sanskrit commentators and Hindi commentators have followed the genre of lectures
 swabhaavatah vyakhyanuwaad athwa bhashyanuwaad mul se bahut bada ho jaataa he or kai staron par to ekadam moulik ban jaataa he
 Where translation works in the role of interpreter, he is only able to translate
 do duurastha deshon ke bhinn bhashaa-bhashi jab aapas main baaten karte hai, to unke bich dubhashiya samvaad kaa madhyam banataa he
 On such occasions, the translation breaks the boundaries of words and expressions, based on the translator's ability to translate
 uske paas itnaa samay nahin hota he ki shabd ke sahi bhashaayi paryaay ke bare main soche athwa koshon kii sahaayta le sake
 Sometimes, due to the misinterpretation of such interpreters, a situation of tension is also created in two countries
 ashyanuwaad hi ab bhashaantaran ke rup main charchit he
 In this context of translation, the translator does not only translate words and expressions from the original language to the target language, but completely transforms the original composition according to his talent and convenience
 wiliam shakespeare ke prasiddh naatak 'marchent of venice' kaa anuwaad bharatendu harishchandr ne 'durlabh bandhu' arthath 'vanspur kaa mahajan' naam se kiya he jo roopantaran ke anuwaad kaa anyatam udhaaharan he
 Names like Antonio, Basolio, Porschea, Shylock of the original play have been adapted by Bharatendu like Anant, Basant, Purshree, Shailaksha respectively
 aise roopantaran main anuwaad kii moulikta sabase adhik ubharkar saamne aati he
 These interpretations of the translator suggest that many styles and methods of translation have been adopted in languages across the world, but if the translator meticulously touches the soul of the word and emotion, it is the ideal to translate the target language in accordance with the nature of the native language
 Will translate
 isiilie shreshth anuvadak ko aisa kushal chikitsak kaha jaataa he, jo bottle main rakhi dawa ko apni syringe ke dwaara rogi ke sharir main yathaavat pahunchaa detaa he
 Translation theory is not an independent, independent, theory in itself, nor is it a 'science' in the sense in which mathematics, philology, sociology, etc
 are
 isaki aisi koi vishisht adhyayan saamagree tathaa adhyayan pranali bhi nahin, jo anya shastron kii adhyayan saamagree tathaa pranali se is rup main bhinn ho ki, iskaa multah swatantra vyaktitv ban sake
 In fact, it is a body of cognitive information related to various issues of translation, which helps in understanding translation as a process, a conclusion, and a relation
 iske liye sadyah 'anuwaad vidya, 'anuwaad vigyaan', or 'anuvaadiki' shabd bhi prachlit hai
 Translation is a process related to linguistics, which has a definite culmination and as a result of which there is a relation of equality in terms of origin and 'value'
 is prakaar prakriya, nishpatti, or sambandh kii sanghatit ikai ke rup main anuwaad sambandhi saamaanya prakruti kii jaankaree hi anuwaad siddhanth he, jo multah ekanvit na hote hue bhi sangrahaniya, rochak, gyanavardhak, tathaa ek seemaa tak vaastavik anuwaad kaary ke liye upadey he
 In its present stage of development, it has become a multi-disciplinary discipline
 jiskaa gyaan praapt karnaa swayamev ek lakshya he tathaa jo jigyaasu pathak ke liye bauddhik santosh kaa strot he
 While assessing the usefulness of translation theory in translation work, the occasional fact is taken into account that in the present day translation has become an organized profession, in which trainees are more motivated by occupational-social need than by personal interest
 vishesh rup se aise logon ke liye tathaa saamaanya rup se ruchishil anuvaadakon ke liye anuwaad kaary main dakshata viksit karne main anuwaad siddhanth ke yogadan ko nirupit kiya jaataa he 
 The theoretical justification of this contribution is also from the point of view that translation work is secondary, because it is creative
 ise 'sarjanaatmak-samikshatmak' bhi kaha jaataa he 
 In order to clarify and confirm the creativeness, the critical comments that are made in the translator are derived from the knowledge of translation theory
 anuwaad kii vishuddhta kii nishpatti main siddhanth gyaan kaa yogadan rahata he 
 Also, knowledge of the translation process can help him work more carefully in synonym selection
 isse adhik mahatvaparn baat maani jaati he ki vah moorkhtapurna trutiyaan karne se batch saktaa he 
 The knowledge of translation theory also helps the translator in developing the watchful vision required so that no part of the text, linguistic, thematic, and cultural significance is left out of translation
 isi prashn ko duusare chor se bhi dekha jaataa he 
 It is said that those who can write original, they write, those who cannot write translate, and those who cannot translate, they discuss about translation
 vastutah in teenon main paripurakta he - ye teenon kuch bhinn-bhinn hai – tathaapi yah mana jaataa he ki anuwaad vishyak charchaa ko adhik pramanik tathaa vishad banane main anuwaad siddhanth ke vidhyaarthee ko anuwaad kaary sambandhi anubhav sahaayak hota he 
 It is such that literature reviewers familiar at the level of prolific experience can present their critical responses more convincingly
 anuwaad siddhanth ke vartmaan swaroop ko dekhte hue iske vikaas kon vihang-drishy se do charnon main vibhakt karke dekha jaataa he : The era before the development of modern linguistics, especially applied linguistics, the early twentieth century; iske pashchaat kaa yug-beesvin sadi uttarardh 
 It is commonly said that the subject of controversy in different epochs of doctrine development and in the same different streams, whether the translation was verbatim or semantic, though the 'language' of the controversy kept changing
 isapurv pratham shatabdi main roman yug se armbh hota he, jab horence tathaa siciro ne shabdanugami tathaa arthanugami anuwaad main antar spasht kiya tathaa saahitiyik rachanaaon ke liye arthanugami anuwaad ko pradhanta di 
 Cicero described a good translator as an interpreter and expert in learning
 roman yug ke pashchaat, jisamen saahitiyik anuwaadon kii pradhanta thi, duusari shaktishaalee dhara bible anuwaad kii he 
 Saint Jerome also prioritized the meaning of meaning in the translation of the Bible and supported the use of the language of day-to-day behavior in translation
 isamen vichaar yah tha ki, bible kaa sandesh jansadharan paryant pahunch jaae or iske nimitt jansadharan ke liye bodhgamy bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaae, jisamen swabhaavatah arthanugami drushtikon ko pradhanta mili 
 John Wycliffe and William Tindl supported this trend
 bodhgamy tathaa sundar bhashaa main, tathaa style evam arth ke madhya samanjasy kii raksha karte hue, bible ke anuwaad kii pravriti ko protsaahan mila, jisamen martin luther kaa yogadan ullekhneey rahaa
 The third section has been related to the contribution of translation in education
 quitillian ne anuwaad tathaa sambhaashi vyaakhyaatmak shabdaantaran kii upyogita ko lekhan abhyaas tathaa bhaashan-dakshata viksit karne ke sandarbh main dekha
 Which spread more in medieval Europe
 isse sthaneey bhashaaon kaa str upar uthaa tathaa unki abhivyakti samarthy main vruddhi bhi hui 
 The trend of translation from rich and developed languages to developing languages is a major trend of the literary world of medieval Europe, which is called the trend of the upward dimension and the tendency of the translation of the level of dimension between the equally developed or underdeveloped languages prevalent at the same time
 Viewed as
 madhyakaalin europe ke aarmabhik siddhantakaaron main french vidwaan i0 dolet ne 1540 main prakashit nibandh main anuwaad ke paanch vidhi-nishedh prastaavit kiye : The translator has complete knowledge of the language of the original author, but he can remove the ambiguity and ambiguity of the original language if he wishes
 anuvadak kaa mulbhasha or lakshyabhasha kaa purna gyaan ho; Translators avoid word-per-word translation; anuvadak dainandin ke vyavhaar kii bhashaa kaa prayog kare; The translator should do such wordings and terminology so that proper effect is concluded
 george chapman ne bhi isi prakaar 'elliod' ke sandarbh main anuwaad ke teen sutara prastaavit kiye : Word-per-word translation should be avoided; mul kii bhaavana paryant pahunchne kaa prayaas kiya jaae; The translation should not be too relaxed due to the touch of scholarship
 europe ke punarjagran yug main anuwaad kii dhara ek gaun pravriti rahi 
 The translators of this era see the tendency to protect the interest of the reader with the primacy of meaning
 holland ke anuwaad main mulpath ke arth main parivartan-parivardhan dwaara anudit paath ke sanskaar kii jhalak dikhti he 
 In the seventeenth century in England, Sir John Denham opposed the tendency to be wordy in the translation of the poem and asserted the central element of the original text and reintroduced it into the target language; He came to be called 'anusarajan'
 is avidh main jaan dryden ne mahatvaparn vichaar prakat kiye
 He defined three categories of translation work: shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad ; Meaningful translation, anukaran 
 According to Dryden, the route between and is acceptable
 unke anusaar kavita ke anuwaad main anuvadak ko donon bhashaaon par adhikaar ho, use mul lekhak ke saahitiyik gunon or uski 'bhaavana' kaa gyaan ho, tathaa vah apane samay ke saahitiyik aadarshon kaa paalan kare
 Alexander Pope also expressed similar views as Dideon
 atharahavin shatabdi main anuwaad kii atimulanishthata tathaa athiswatantrata ke vivaad se ek sopan aage badhkar ek samasya thi ki apane samakaleen pathak ke prati anuvadak kaa kartavya 
 Due to excessive inclination towards the reader, the form of the translated text used to be far away from the original text

 samuel janson ne kaha ki, anuwaad main mulpath kii apeksha parivardhan ke kaaran utpann parishkruti kaa swaagat kiya ja saktaa he, parantu mulpath kii haani na ho ye dhyaan dena chaiye
 He also said that just as the writer writes for his contemporary reader, the translator also translates for his contemporary reader
 dow
 janson kii sammati main anuwaad kii mulanishthata tathaa pathakdharmita main santulan miltaa he 
 He called the translator such a painter or follower who, despite being loyal to the original, takes care of the interests of the intended audience
 eleggender frager titaler jinaki pustak principles aaf transleshan anuwaad siddhanth par pehali vyavasthit pustak maani jaati he 
 Tittler proposed three translation formulas: anuwaad main mul rachana ke bhav kaa puraa anurakshan ho; The style of translation should be consistent with the original; anuwaad main mul vaali subodhta ho
 It is said by Tittler that, in translation, the feeling of the original should be so thoroughly solicited that after reading it, the readers get as intense feeling as the original readers had; This is the principle of efficacy

 Schlegel called all kinds of oral and written language practice translation, and emphasized on preserving the formation of the original
 is yug main ek ore to anuvadak ko sarjanaatmak lekhak ke tulya samajhane kii pravriti dikhaai detii he, to duusari ore anuwaad ko shabdanugami banane par bal dene kii baat kahi gai 
 Some scholars have discussed translation as having a different dialect that matches the above beliefs
 victorian dhara ke anuvadak is baat ke liye prayatnsheel rahe ki desh or kaal kii duuri ko anuwaad main surakshit rakhaa jaae – videshi bhashaaon kii pracheen rachanaaon ke anuwaad main videshiyata or pracheenta kii haani na ho - jiske falswaroop shabdanugami anuwaad kii pravriti ko protsaahan mila 
 Longfellow was its supporter
 parantu umr khaiyam kii rubaayiyon ke anuvadak fitjerald ke vichaar iske vipareet the 
 He was a supporter of the belief that instead of bringing the reader of the translation closer to the original language text, the cultural features of the original language text should be presented in the target language in such a way that it appears to be the live property of the target language, and in the process the native language The increased distance from translation should be ignored
 beesvin sadi ke purvardh main do-teen anuwaad chintak ullekhneey hai 
 Kroche and Velary have expressed doubts in the success of the translation, particularly the success of the translation of the poem
 mathew ornald ne homer kii kritiyon ke anuwaad main saral, pratyaksh or udaatt style ko apnaane par bal diya
 Thus in the period before the rise of modern linguistics, translation thinking often revolved around two opposing beliefs
 wo do manyataayen is prakaar hai - The translation should be verbose or free anuwaad apni aantarik prakruti kii drushti se asambhav he, parantu saamaajik drushti se nitant aavashyak 
 Overall the balance of phenomenological and discriminatory views is seen in the translation thought of this period - from the perspective of translation, it means a form of translation theory which is of general order, and in the differentiated view, it is necessary in the system of translation based on the natural variation of the texts
 Discussion of change has its implications
 vidwaanon ne is avadhi main amoort chintan to kiya parantu ve anuwaad pranali kaa sodaaharan pallavan nahin kar paae 
 With the insightful understanding of the text, they moved towards the goal of analytical comprehension, but there was no definite theory behind it
 aise chintakon main anuvaadakon ke atirikt sahityakar tathaa sahitya-sameekshak hi adhik the, bhashavigyaani nahin 
 In addition, they did not seem to be familiar with each other's thoughts

 During this period, the attention of translators and linguists familiar with linguistics attracted attention to translation theory
 sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa vikaas, arthvigyaan kii pragati, sampreshan siddhanth tathaa bhashavigyaan kaa samanvay, tathaa anuprayukt bhashavigyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon - samajabhashavigyaan, shailivigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, prokti vishleshan - kaa vikaas, tathaa sanketvigyaan, visheshtah paath sanketavigyaan, kaa udai aisi ghatnaayen maani jaati hai, jo anuwaad siddhanth ko pusht tathaa viksit karne kii drushti se mahatvapurn maani jaati rahi
 a scholar Eugen Nida is also considered in the anglo-american stream
 unhone bible-anuwaad ke anubhav ke aadhaar par anuwaad siddhanth or vyavhaar par apane vichaar granthon ke rup main prakat kiye 
 In these, a detailed, detailed and logical form of translation theory can be seen
 naida ne anuwaad prakriya kaa vivaran dete hue mulbhasha paath ke vishleshan ke liye ek sunishchit bhashasiddhanth prastut kiya tathaa lakshyabhasha main sashakrant sandesh ke punargathan ke vibhinn aayam nirdhaarit kiye
 He gave a description of the multidimensional adjustments between the two languages related to the status of translation

 bahut se vidyut yaa electronic ghatakon yaa avyavon ko jodakar vidyut paripath banate hai
 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained
 dedh-do volt sahan kar sakane vaale saikadon balbon ko shreneekram main jodakar 230 volt se gharelu bijli se unako jagamagaaya jaataa he
 If 24 volts are needed somewhere, 24 volts can be obtained by connecting two 12 volt batteries in series

 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary

 Jain philosophy is based on eternal truth
 samay ke saath ye satya adrishy ho jate he or phir sarvagy yaa kevalgyani dwaara prakat hote he
 Lord Prathpara was the first Tirthankara in this period of his journey, followed by Lord Parshva
 jain dharm sikhaata he ki prayek jeev apane karmo ke liye savyam jimmevaar he
 It insists that we live, think and act respectfully and honor the spiritual nature of all life
 Jains view God as the unchanging traits of the pure soul of each living being, chiefly described as Infinite Knowledge, Perception, Consciousness, and Happiness
 Jainism does not include a belief in an omnipotent supreme being or creator, but rather in an eternal universe governed by natural laws, and the interplay of its attributes of matter
 Jain scriptures were written over a long period and the most cited is the Tattvartha Sutra, or Book of Reality written by Umasvati ,the monk-scholar, more than 18 centuries ago
 The primary figures in Jainism are Tirthankars
 Jainism has two main divisions: Digambar and Shvetambar and both believe in ahimsa, asceticism, karma, sansar, and jiva
 Compassion for all life, human and non human, is central to j Jainism
 Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment and to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is unimaginably abhorrent
 It is the only religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian
 Some Indian regions have been strongly influenced by Jains and often, the majority of the local non Jain population has also become vegetarian
 History suggests that various strains of Hinduism became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences
 In many towns, Jains run animal shelters, eg Delhi has a bird hospital run by a Jain temple
 Svetambara Jain worshipping at the temple at Ranakpur

 The cloth over his face is to prevent spit, mucus, or bacteria from the mouth or nose from landing on holy images, books or the idols of the Tirtankars Jainism's stance on nonviolence goes beyond vegetarianism
 Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty
 Many are vegan due to the violence of modern dairy farms
the orthodox Jain diet excludes most root vegetables, as they believe this destroys life unnecessarily
 Another reason for refusing root vegetables is to avoid destroying entire plants
 If you eat apples, you do not destroy whole trees, but for root vegetables, whole plants are uprooted
 Garlic and onions are avoided as these are seen as creating passion, meaning anger, hatred, jealousy
 Observant Jains do not eat, drink, or travel after sunset and always rise before sunrise
 Anekantavada, a foundation of Jain philosophy literally meaning "nonsingular Conclusivity", or equivalently, "non-one-endedness"
 Anekantavad consists of tools for overcoming inherent biases in any one perspective on a topic, object, process, state, or on reality in general
 Another tool is The Doctrine of Postulation, Syādvāda
 Anekantavad is defined as a multiplicity of views for it stresses looking at things from another's perspective
 Jains are remarkably welcoming and friendly toward other faiths
 Several non-jain temples in India are administered by Jains
 The Jain Heggade family has run the Hindu institutions of Dharmasthala, including the Sri Manjunath Temple, for eight centuries
 Jains willingly donate money to churches and mosques and usually help with interfaith functions
 Jain monks, like Acharya Tulsi and Acharya Sushil Kumar, actively promoted harmony among rival faiths to defuse tension
 Jains have been a palpable presence in Indian culture, developing to Indian philosophy, art, architecture, sciences, and to Mohandas Gandhi's politics, which led to the mainly non-violent movement for Indian independence
 samocch rekhaaen yaa parirekhaayen us vakr ko kehete hai jo jis par kisi bhautik raashi kaa maan samaan hota he
 For example, the lines joining points of equal height on a map of an area would be called contour lines
 duusare shabdon main, yadi koi bhautik raashi do charon kaa falan ho to is tal main ek vakr kii kalpana karen jiske sabhi binduon par kisi bhautik raashi samaan ho to is vakr ko ek parirekha kahenge
 Contour lines are often drawn by mapping points of equal height in mapping
 kintu samocch rekhaon kaa upyog maanchitran ke alaava bahut se anya kshetron main bhi kiya jaataa he

 The independent vibration of any elastic object is at its natural frequency
 swatantra kampan or pranodith kampan se bhinn he
 The frequency of the vibrating force is equal to the frequency of the applied external force
 kintu yadi lagaaye gayi vahya bal kii aavriti nikaay ke prakritik aavriti ke baraabar ho to dolan kaa aayam kai guna bad jaataa he
 This is called resonance

 He is a descendant of the Tai caste who came to the Brahmaputra Valley in 1220 with their Tai prince Chukafa and dominated the region for six centuries
 chukaafaa or unke anuyaayiyon ne assam main ahom vansh kii sthapana kii
 Chukafa and his successors drove and expanded the Ahom kingdom for 6 centuries
 1826 main pratham anglo-burmi yuddh jeetne ke baad british logon ne ahom raajaaon ke saath yandubu sandhi kii or is kshetra main niyantran sthapit kiya
 The modern Ahom people and their culture are basically an syncretic blend of Tai culture, local tibeto-burmese and Hinduism
 chukaafaa ke tai anuyaayiyon jo avivaahit the, uname se adhiktaron ne baad main sthaneey samudaayon main shaadi kii
 Chronically many ethnic groups, including tibeto-burmese-speaking Borahi, fully joined the Ahom community
 ahom samrajya ne anya samudaayon ke logon ko bhi unki pratibha kii upyogita ke liye tathaa unki nishtha ke aadhaar par ahom sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 Over time, the Ahom people embraced Hinduism and other aspects of Indian culture
 saath hi unhone ahom bhashaa ke badale asamiya bhashaa ko apni bol chaal kii bhashaa ke rup main apana liya
 Although one-third of the Ahom population still follow the ancient Tai religion Furlong
 20veen shatabdi ke madhya tak ahom logon ke purohit or ucch varg ke lagbhag 400-500 log ahom bhashaa hi bolte the
 But now the Ahom is not speaking the language or has remained nominal
 ahom janagoshtee ke liye yah ek chintaneey vishay he
 Now again, an attempt is being made to revive the Tai Ahom language again among the general public
 iske liye vibhinn tai ahom sanghathanon dwaara upree assam main tai skulon kii sthapana kii ja rahi he or bacchon ko tai bhashaa padhne ke liye prerit kiya ja rahaa he

 However, in some methods, benign bacteria, such as yeast or fungi, are used to enhance special properties and preserve foods

 Digital watermarking can be used for a wide range of applications: jo soochna antahsthapit kii jaani ho vah digital watermark kehalaati he, haalanki kuch sandarbhon main vaakyansh digital watermark kaa arth watermark kiye gaye signal or cover signal ke bich kaa antar he
 The signal where the watermark is to be inserted is called the nutrient signal
 aam taur par watermarking pranali teen alag charnon main vibhajit hoti he, antahsthapana, hamalaa or pataa lagaana
 antahsthapana main, ek elgoridam antahsthapit kiye jane vaale poshak or data ko sweekaar karata he or ek watermark signal paidaa karata he
 The watermarked signal is then broadcast or stored, usually communicated to another person
 agar vah vyakti koi sanshodhan karata he, to yah hamalaa kehalaata he
 While the amendment may not be malicious, the term attack came from a copyright protection application, where pirates attempt to remove the digital watermark via modification
 kai sambhavit sanshodhan maujuud hai, udhaaharan ke liye, data kaa hanipurna sampeedan, ek chhavi yaa video kaa drushyankan, yaa jaanboojhkar shor jodna
 Detection is an algorithm that is applied to the incoming signal to try to extract a watermark from it
 If the signal was unchanged during the broadcast, the watermark is still present and can be removed
 thos watermarking anuprayogon main, nishkarshan elgoridam sahi dhang se watermark utpaadit karne main sakasham hona chahie, bhale hi sanshodhan majboot hon
 najuk watermarking main, nishkarshan elgoridam ko asafal hona chahie yadi signal main koi parivartan kiya jaae
 a digital watermark is said to be concrete in relation to changes if the embedded information can be reliably identified with the marked signals, even if it is distorted with any number of changes
 vishisht chhavi vikrutiyaan hai JPEG sampeedan, aavartan, drushyankan, shor sangyojan or kwantman
 video saamagree asthaayee sanshodhan or MPEG sampeedan aksar is suchi main jud jate hai
 a watermark is said to be imperceptible if the cover signal and the marked signal are indistinguishable in terms of the appropriate perceptual metric
 In general, it is easy to create a solid watermark or unmarked watermark, but it has proved to be quite challenging to create a solid and unmarked watermark
 thos agochar watermark ko digital saamagree ke sangrakshan ke liye saadhan ke rup main prastaavit kiya gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye, peshewar video saamagree main ek antahsthapit 'pratilipi anumat nahin' dhvaj ke rup main
 Digital watermarking techniques can be classified in several ways
 agar thode se parivartan ke baad pahchaanane main vifal rahata he to watermark ko najuk kaha jaataa he
 Fragile watermarks are commonly used to detect tampering
 saamanytah mul kaary ke saath parivartan jo spasht rup se dikhaai den unhen watermark ke rup main nirdisht nahin kiya jaataa, balki aam taur par barcode kaha jaataa he
 a watermark is said to be semi-delicate if it resists benign conversions, but fails to detect them after incurable conversions
 arddh najuk watermark kaa istemaal saamanytah asaadhya parivartanon kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 If the watermark resists a named class of conversions, it is said to be strong
 majboot watermark kaa upyog copy or abhigam niyantran soochna vahan karne ke liye, pratilipi sangrakshan anuprayogon main kiya ja saktaa he
 a watermark is called unmarked if the original cover signal and the marked signal are directly indistinguishable
 ek watermark ko pratyaksh kaha jaataa he agar chihnit signal main uski upasthiti suspasht he, lekin anuchit hastkshep sambhav nahin
 The length of the embedded message defines the classes of two different main watermarking schemes: yadi chihnit signal ko yogtmak sanshodhan dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he, to aisi watermarking paddati ko sprad-spectrum ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Spread-spectrum watermarks are commonly known as strong, but they also have low information capability due to nutritional interference
 yadi parimanikaran dwaara chihnit signal praapt ho, to aisi watermarking paddati ko kwantizeshan tip mana jaataa he
 Quantization watermarks are less robust, but have higher information efficiency due to rejection of nutritional interference
 watermarking paddati ko emplitude modulation ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he yadi chihnit signal ko yogtmak sanshodhan dwaara antahsthapit kiya jaae, jo sprad spectrum paddati ke samaan hi he lekin yah vishesh rup se sthanik domen main antahsthapit hota he
 Digital watermarking schemes can provide detailed information for a watermark designer or end users

 Often a watermark designer is used to evaluate single properties for performance, for example, improvements
 End users are mostly not interested in detailed information

 Jalaluddin crossed the Indus River to India where he requested help from Sultan Iltutmish of Delhi

 Pali was the language of the people of ancient North India
 jo purv main bihar se pashchim main haryana-rajasthan tak or uttar main nepal-uttarapradesh se dakshin main madhyapradesh tak boli jaati thi
 Lord Buddha also continued to explain the religion to the people while going around in these regions

 Therefore, Pali is ancient Hindi
 yah hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar main kii ek boli yaa praakrit he
 It is also known as the language of Buddhist Tripitaka
 paali, brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main likhi jaati thi
 Regarding the etymology of the word Pali, there are many opinions of scholars
 kisi ne ise paath shabd se tathaa kisi ne pid se utpann karne kaa praytn kiya he
 Max Valeser, a German scholar, has expressed the opinion that he refers to the ancient language of Pataliputra by referring to Pali as an abbreviation for 'patali'
 in vyutpattiyon kii apeksha jin do maton kii ore vidwaanon kaa adhik jhukaav he, unamem se ek to he pan vidhushekhar bhattacharya kaa mat, jiske anusaar pali, pankti shabd se vyutpann hua he
 This view is strongly supported by an ancient Pali dictionary, Abhidhanappadipika, because in these words Tanti, Buddhism, Panthi and Pali, Pali also clearly means the line
 purvokt do arthon main pali ke jo prayog milte hai, unki bhi is arth se sarthakata siddh ho jaati he
 The meaning of the line of Buddhavachana or the line of the text sits in the experiments of Buddhaghosha
 tathaapi dhvanivigyaan ke anusaar pankti shabd se pali kii vyutpatti nahin baithai ja sakati
 It seems more appropriate to relate the word to the word Pali, Paththa, Padu, which is prevalent in the meaning of the line
 pali shabd peeche sanskrit main bhi prachlit hua paaya jaataa he
 The derivation of Pali in the Abhidhanappadipika, "paleti Rakhtati Pali", has been stated in this way also supports this view
 kintu "pali mahavyakaran" ke karta bhikshu jagadish kashyap ne pali ko pankti ke arth main lene ke vishay main kuch aapattiyaan uthaai hai or use mul tripitak granthon main anek sthanon par prayukt 'pariyay' shabd se vyutpann batalaane kaa praytn kiya he
 According to the Magadhi tendency in place of the word 'dhammapariya' of Tripitaka in the Bhabru inscription of Emperor Ashoka, the use of the word 'dhamma Paliyya' is found, which means Buddha-sermon or word
 kashyap ji ke anusaar isi paliyaay sharan se pali kii vyutpatti hui
 No name of the language is found anywhere in the original Tripitaka
 kintu buddhaghosh aadi aacharyon ne buddha ke upadeshon kii bhashaa ko magadhi kaha he
 In Visuddhimagga and Mahavansa this Magadhi has been called the root language of all beings
 uske sthaan par pali shabd kaa prayog praaia: 14veen shatee i
 ke purv nahin paaya jaataa
 Yes, Buddhaghosha has used the word Pali in his biographies, but not in the sense of language, but in the meaning of the text of Buddhavakha or Moolatripitaka and that too often to make that text look different from the story
 is prakaar kahin unhone kaha he ki isaki pali is prakaar he, kintu atthkatha main aisa he, athwa yah baat na pali main he or na atthkatha main ai he
 The word Pali is found to be used in these two meanings in some of the Deepavans written before the time of Buddhaghosh and also in the later works of Mahavans etc
 isi arthprayog se kramash: pali shabd us sahitya tathaa uski bhashaa ke liye bhi kiya jane laga
 In terms of language, Pali is a form of that medieval Indian Aryan language, whose development was around BC
 Considered from the sixth century
 usase purv kii adiugin bhartiya aryabhasha kaa swaroop vedon tathaa brahmanon, upanishdon evam ramayana, mahabharat aadi granthon main praapt hota he, jinhen 'vaidic bhashaa' evam 'sanskrit bhashaa' kehete hai
 The distinction of medieval languages is more prominent in the following things than Vedic language and Sanskrit: vyakaran kii drushti se These features are common features of the medieval Indian Aryan language and are found in the lingua franca of the country whose propagation lasted for some two thousand years from the said period and whose literature is also available
 ukt saamaanya lakshanon ke atirikt in bhashaaon main apane-apane desh or kaal kii apeksha naanaa bhed paae jate hai
 Their three levels are considered from the point of view of time - in sab yugon kii bhashaaon ko ek saamaanya naam praakrit diya gaya he
 Its first level is found in the form of languages in Ashoka's commendations and Pali literature
 dwitiya str kii bhashaaon main magadhi, ardhamagadhi, shauraseni evam maharashtri praakrit bhashaayen he jinka vipul sahitya uplabdh he
 The third level languages are named apabhransh and avahath
 deshbhed kii drushti se madhyakaalin bhashaaon ke bhed kaa sarvapracheen parichay maury samrat ashok kii dharmalipiyon main praapt hota he
 There are three distinct distinctions - Eastern, Western and Western
 purvi bhashaa kaa swaroop dhauli or jogarh kii prashastiyon main dikhaai detaa he
 In these, the inflection of the nominative singular of the words l and Shakanta is well established
 praakrit ke vaiyakarnon ne in pravritiyon ko magadhi praakrit ke vishesh lakshanon main ginaya he
 According to the grammaticalization, the third special feature of this Magadhi Prakrit is the use of Sh in place of the three hot colors
 kintu ashok ke ukt lekhon main yah pravriti nahin pai jaati, kyonki yahan teenon ooshmon ke sthaan par s hi prayukt hua he
 For this reason, it is more appropriate to call this eastern nature of Ashoka as Magadhi and not the ancient form of Ardhamagadhi
 pashchimi bhashaa bhed kaa pratinidhitiv karanevaalon main girnaar kii prashastiyaan hai
 Among them, the distinction between Su and l is safe
 ooshmon ke sthaan par s kaa prayog he tathaa acarant karta kaarak ekvachan rup o main ant hota he
 It is clear from these trends that this language is an ancient form of Shaurseni
 pashchimottar kii bhashaa kaa rup shahbajgadhi or mansera kii prashastiyon main dikhaai detaa he
 Often, these three hot colors are safe in their place
 kahin-kahin kuch vyatyay drushtigochar hota he
 Rakarayukta samyavarna also appears, and the use of Ranj is found in place of Jya and Nyya
 ye pravritiyaan us bhashaa ko pashachi praakrit kaa purv rup ingit karti hai
 Some part of Pali Tripitaka must have assumed literary form during the time of Ashoka as seven episodes of his Lahuloism, Monayyasutt etc
 are mentioned in his praise of Bhabru
 kintu uplabdh sahitya kii bhashaa main ashok ke purvi shilaalekh kii bhashaa sambandhi visheshtaon kaa praaia: sarvatha abhaav he
 Broadly, the form of Pali language most closely matches the language of the Girnar commendation, and for this reason Pali is not primarily east, but central
 jis visheshta ke kaaran pali madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha ke pratham str kii gini jaati he, dwitiya kii nahin, vah he usamen madhyavarti aghosh vyanjanon ke lop tathaa mahapraan varnon ke sthaan par h ke aadesh kaa abhaav
 These trends are common features of second-level languages
 haan, kahin kahin k t jaise aghosh varnon ke sthaan par g d aadi saghosh varnon kaa aadesh dikhaai detaa he
 But this one is only in a small quantity and the other is indicative of the relatively later trend within the said dignity of the first level
 pali bhashaa evam madhyakaalin bhartiya aryabhashaon ke sambandh main dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki yah bhashavikas jo sanskrit se mana jaataa he vah thik nahin
 In fact, since the Vedic period, the lingua franca, along with the literary language, has taken the form of literary natural languages according to the country and time
 pali bhi apni puri viraasat sanskrit se nahin le rahi, kyonki usamen anke shabdarup aise paae jate hai jiskaa mail sanskrit se nahin, kintu vedon kii bhashaa se baithta he
 For example, in Pali and other Prakrit, forms like Deverbhi, Devehi, of Tritiya plural are found
 acarant sangyaaon ke aise roopon kaa sanskrit main sarvatha abhaav he, kintu vaidic main deverbhi, utana hi suprachilit he jitna devai:
 Therefore, the tradition of the above form can be considered as originating from the Vedic language in Pali and Prakrit
 usee prakaar pali main 'yamamase', 'maasre', 'kaatve' aadi anek rup aise hai jinke pratyay sanskrit main paae hi nahin jate, kintu vaidic bhashaa main vidyaman hai
 Literature written in Prakrit is not available before Pali texts and Ashoka's commendations and Prakrit grammars have done grammatical analysis of Prakrit language by considering Sanskrit as Prakriti for their convenience and hence the confusion has arisen that Prakrit languages originated in Sanskrit
 resulted from
 pali ke kacchan, moggallan aadi vyakaranon main yah dosha nahin paaya jaataa, kyonki vahaan bhashaa kaa varnan sanskrit ko prakruti maanak nahin kiya gaya
