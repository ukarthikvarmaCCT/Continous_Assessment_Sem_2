 The Mahatmas kept these curiosities with regard to Bhagavata Purana from Sutji: maharishi parashar or devi satyavati ke sanyog se shrinarayan ke anshavatar dev vyasaji kaa janm hua
 Vyasji, recognizing his time and the state of the society, divided the Vedas into four parts and made his four Patu disciples understand them
 iske pashchaat vedadhyayan ke adhikaar se vanchit nar-naariyon kaa mandabudhiyon ke kalyaan ke liye attharah puraanon kii rachana kii, taaki ve bhi dharm-paalan main samarth ho saken
 Sutji said - Mahatma! According to Guruji's responsibility, the responsibility of spreading and propagating seventeen Puranas came upon me, but the Bhog and Mokshadata Bhagavata Purana itself was narrated by Guruji to Janmejaya
 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa

 raja ne nau din nirantar lokmata bhagwati durga kii puja-aradhana kii tathaa muni vedavyas ke mukh se lokmata kii mahima se purna bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya
 Sri Krishna was lost in an attempt to find Prasenjit who returned safely with the blessings of Sri Devi Bhagwati
 yah vrittant maharishiyon kii ichha se vistaar se sunaate hue shri sutaji kehane lage-sajjanon ! bahut pehle dwarka puri main bhojavanshi raja satrajit rahata tha
 Due to the devotion and worship of the Sun, he received a very bright gem named Swamantak
 mani kii kranti se raja swayan surya jaisaa prabhaa-mandit ho jaataa tha
 In this confusion, when the Yadavas spoke to Shri Krishna about the arrival of Lord Surya, then Antaryami Krishna, while removing the doubts of the Yadavas, said that the upcoming nobleman Maniadhari king is Satrajit, not Surya
 swamantak mani kaa gun tha ki usko dhaaran karne vaala pratidin aath kilo swarna praapt karegaa
 There was no sign of any kind of human or divine calamity in that region
 swamantak mani praapt karne kii ichha swayan krishna ne bhi kii lekin satrajit ne asweekaar kar diya
 Once Satrajit's brother Prasenjit, wearing the gem, went on a horse and went hunting, then a lion killed him
 sanyog se jamavant naamak rich ne singh ko hi maar daalaa or vah mani ko lekar apni gupha main aa gaya
 Jamwant's daughter started playing with the jewel, thinking it was a toy
 prasenjit ke na lautne par dwarka main yah afvaah fail gai ki krishna ko satrajit dwaara mani dene se inkaar karne par durbhaavnavash krishna ne prasenjit kii hatya kara di or mani par apana adhikaar kar liya
 Unhappy with this rumor, Krishna set out to find Prasenjit
 van main krishna or unke saathiyon ne prasenjit ke saath ek singh ko bhi mara paaya
 They also found signs of bear footprints there, which indicated the entrance into the cave
 isse krishna ne singh ko maarane tathaa mani ke rich ke paas hone kaa anumaan lagaaya
 Krishna himself entered the cave by telling his companions to stay outside and wait
 kaaphi samay baad bhi krishna ke waapas na aane par niraash hokar laute saathi ne krishna ke bhi maare jane kaa mithyaa prachaar kar diya
 On Krishna's return, his father Vasudeva was distressed in his son-mourning
 usee samay maharishi naarad aa gaye
 Knowing the news, Naradji preached to Vasudeva to listen to Shrimad Devi Bhagavata Purana
 vasudev maa bhagwati kii krupa se purv parichit the
 He told Naradji - Devarshi, while imprisoned with Devaki, when the six sons were killed at the hands of Kansa, both of our husbands and wives became very upset and upset
 tab apane kul purohit maharishi garg se paraamarsh kiya or ksht se chhutkaaraa paane kaa upaay poocha
 Gurudev asked to parade the saga of Jagadamba Maa
 karagaar main hone ke kaaran mere liye yah sambhav nahin tha
 Therefore, prayed to Gurudev to get this work done

 Performed a Navagna sacrifice of Goddess Bhagwat by law

 Vasudev should bring that child to the house of nand-yashoda of Gokul village and bring the girl of Yashoda born at the same time and hand it to Kamsa as the eighth child
 kansa yathavat balika ko dharti par patake degaa
 That girl will immediately leave Kansa's hand and wear a celestial body, part of me will dwell on the Vidhyanchal mountain for public welfare
 garg muni ke dwaara is anushthan fal ko sun kar maine prasannataa vyakt karte hue aage ghati ghatnaayen muni ke kathananusaar puri kin or krishna kii raksha kii
 After narrating this description, Vasudev said to Naradji - Muniver! Fortunately, your arrival has proved beneficial for me
 at: aap hi mujhe devi bhagwat puraana kii katha sunaakar upakrit karen
 At the behest of Vasudeva, Narada graciously performed Navahra Parine
 vasudev ne nawein din katha samaapti par naradji kii puja-archana kii bhagwati maa kii maaya se shrikrishna jab gupha main pravisht hue to unhone ek balika ko mani se khelte dekha
 As soon as Krishna took the gem from the girl, the girl wept

 The war lasted for twenty-seven days in both

 comics ek madhyam he jahaan vichaaron ko vyakt karne ke liye saamaanya paathyakram ke apeksha chitron, evam bahudhaa shabdon ke mishran tathaa anya chitrit soochnaaon kii sahaayta se padhaa jaataa he
 In the comics, any specific differences and scenes have been continuously expressed by the panel of pictures
 aksar shabdic yuktiyon ko spich belunon, anushirshakon, evam arthanuranan jinamein samvaad, vrutant, dhwani prabhaav evam anya soochnaaon ko bhi inase vyakt karte hai
 Lecturing the story with the shape and systematic combination of the painted panels makes reading easier

 In the common form, we read comics through a comic strip, editorial or gag cartoons and comics books
 vahiin gat 20veen shatabdi tak, apane simit sanskarnon jaise graphic upanyaason, kamiks elbum, or tancoban ke rup main isane saamanyatya kaaphi unnati paayi he or ab 21veen sadi main online webkamiks ke taur par bhi kaaphi kaamyaab sabit hui he
 The diverse development of chemistry history is also a result of cultural diversity
 buddhijivi maanate he ki is tarah kii shuruyaat ham pragaitihaasik yug ke lascouks kii gupha chitron se andaja laga sakate hai
 By the mid-20th century, the expansion of comics had flourished in the United States, the Western European provinces, and Japan
 europee kamiks ke itihaas main gaur karen to 1830 main rudolph tappher kii banaai cartoon strip kaaphi lokapriy the, jo aage chalakar unki banaai da adventure of tintin 1930 tak strip evam pustak ke rup kaaphi kaamyaab rahi thi
 American comics gained access to the public through the newspaper strip of comics until the early 20th; Magazine-style comics books also began to be published in 1930, and in 1938 a new phase of the superhero generation emerged after the arrival of such iconic characters as Superman
 vahiin japani kamiks yaa cartooning kaa mul itihaas to 12veen shatabdi ke purvaaddh se bhi purana he
 The modern comics strip in Japan emerged in the 20th century, and heavy production of comics magazines and books was also produced during World War II, bringing cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka to prominence
 haalaanki kamiks kaa itihaas tab tak doum darje ke rup main janaa jaataa rahaa tha, lekin 20veen sadi ke ant tak aate-aate janata tathaa shaikshik sansthaaon ne jaise ise tahe dil se sweekruti de di
 On the other hand, "comics" is seen as a singular noun in the English definition when it means a middle and plural representation of particular examples and events, through individual strips or comics books
 yadhyapi anya paribhaasha in hasyakaarak jaise kaary purv america akhabaaron ke kamiks stripon par prabal rup se prayog hota tha, par jald isane gaiyr-hasya jaise maapdandon kaa bhi nirmaan kar liya
 Like the mention of comics in English in general, different cultures have been used in their native languages, such as Japanese comics as manga, and French-language comics are called bandis decianis
 lekin abhi tak kamiks kii sahi paribhaasha ko lekar vichaarkon tathaa itihaaskaaron ke madhya aam sahmati nahin bani he; kuchhek apane tark par bal dete hai ki yah chitron evam shabdon kaa sangyojan hai, kuch ise anya chitron se sambandhit yaa krambaddh chitron kii kahani kehete he, or kuch anya itihaaskaar sweekaarte he yah kisi vyapak paimaane ke punarutpaadan kii tarah he jisamen kisi vishesh paatr kii nirantar aavruti hoti rahati he
 Giving an explanation of this mixed-pollination by different comics culture and era has also become quite complicated

 F
 Outcault, 1898 european, america tathaa japani kamiks kii paramparaayen vibhinn margon se hokar gujri hai
 Like the beginning of the European tradition can be traced back to 1827 with the Swiss Rodolphe Tapper, and its origins can be traced by the Americans through The Yellow Kid published in the 1890 newspaper strip by Richard Outcault, although most Americans, Taupfer himself, Has been giving preference to bring japan main is tarah ke vyangyatmak cartoonon kaa ek lanbaa pragaitihaaskaal rahaa he tathaa dwitiya vishwayuddh ke saath kamikson kaa yug rachaa gaya tha
 Comics and manga, cartoons made in the Japanese style by Yukio-e Artist Hokusai, were popular long before the 19th century
 vahiin yuddh ke dauraan aae aadhunik yug se japani kamiks kaa vikaas shuru hone laga jab osamu tezuka ne iske faldaayi kaary ke nirmaan kaa hissaa bane
 By the late 20th century, these three different traditions simultaneously allowed comics to be in the shape of the book: such as the Comics album in Europe, The Tankbon in Japan, and the graphic novel in English-speaking countries
 vahiin bahya taur par kamiks ko lekar vanshavaaliyon, kamiks vichaarkon evam itihaaskaaron ne ise lascouks ke gupha chitron kii prerana kaa udhaaharan dete hai jaisaa ki france main, mishra ke chitra-lipiyon, rome main trajan ke stambh, 11veen shatabdi kii normain beyex tapastry, ke banaae 1370 bois protate kii woodkats, 15veen shatabdi kii ars moriendi or blaak books, mikelenjalo kii da cystin chapel main rachit da last jajment, or wiliam hogarth kii 17veen shatabdi main bani silsilewar nakkashi, tathaa bich main aise anya kai udhaaharan

 unki rachanaayen na keval angrej jati ke liye gaurav kii vastu hai varan vishwavanmay kii bhi amar vibhuti hai
 Shakespeare's imagination was as serious as his life's experience
 at: jahaan ek ore unke naatakon tathaa unki kavitaaon se anand kii uplabdhi hoti he vahiin duusari ore unki rachanaaon se hamako gambhir jeevandarshan bhi praapt hota he
 Poets are rarely found in Shakespeare's equivalent in the history of world literature

 There is considerable disagreement as to the date of the works of Shakespeare
 san 1930 main prasiddh vidvan sar i
ke
 chambers ne tithikram kii jo talika prastut kii vah aaj praaia: sarvamaanya he
 Nevertheless, the discovery of previous years has led to some new assumptions regarding dates

 Shakespeare's prolific talent continued to develop over the course of nearly 20 years of literary life
 saamaanya rup se is vikascram main chaar vibhinn avasthaaen dikhaai detii he
 The initial phase ended in 1595
 is kaal kii praaia: sabhi rachanaayen prayogtmak he
 Shakespeare had not yet been able to determine his path, and was therefore progressively implementing his various compositions, in the prolific style of the ancient comical plays, 'the Comedy of Errors' and 'the Taming of the Sou'
 Created taduparant 'loves lebers lost' main inhone lily ke darbari sukhaant naatakon kii paripati apanaai
 It has an atmosphere of court which is full of interesting dialogue of clever characters
 'di tu jentilmen ov verona' main green ke svachhndathawadi sukhaant naatakon kaa anukaran kiya gaya he
 Sad dramas are also imitative
 'richard tritiy' main maalon kaa tathaa 'titus andranicus' main kid kaa anukaran kiya gaya he kintu 'romeo and juliet' main moulikta kaa ansh apekshaakrit adhik he
 Both the famous poems written in the same period 'the Rape of Lucreis' and 'venus and Adonis' have the imprint of the erstwhile Italian lovemaking
 vikascram kii duusari avasthaa san 1600 main samaapt hui
 In this, Shakespeare presented many mature works to the world
 ab unhone apana maarg nirdhaarit tathaa aatmavishvaas arjeet kar liya tha
 'A Mid Summer Nights Dream' and 'the Merchant on Venice' are interesting and popular melodramas but even more important are Shakepeare's quintessential pleasures such as Much Ado About Nothing, 'as You Like It' and 'twelve Night'
 Written in time
 in naatakon main kavi kii kalpana tathaa uske man ke ahlad kaa uttam prakaashan hua he
 The best historical plays were also written at this time
 marlo se prabhavit 'richard dwitiya' usee shrenee kii purvavarti kriti 'richard tritiy' se rachanavinyas main kahin adhik safal he
 Both the parts of 'henry IV' and 'henry V' which are well known historical dramas, are compositions of this period
 shakespeare ke praaia: sabhi sonet jo apni utkrisht abhivyakti ke liye anupam hai, san 1595 ore 1607 ke bich likhe gaye
 The third stage, which ended in about 1607, holds special significance in Shakespeare's life
 in varshon main paariwarik vipatti evam swasthya kii kharabi ke kaaran kavi kaa man avasann tha
 Hence, most of the compositions of these days are sad
 vishwaprasiddh du:khant naatak hamelet, othelo, king lier or makebeth evam roman du:khant naatak julius sijar, 'antony and cleopatra' evam 'coriolenus' isi kalavadhi main likhe gaye or abhinit hue
 'trivialus and Cressida', 'all's well that ends well' and 'major for Major' have a mixed expression of happiness and grief, even then only the tragic part is predominant
 vikaas kii antim avasthaa main shakespeare ne pericules, sinvilin, 'di winters tail', 'di tempast' prabhruti naatakon kaa sarjan kiya, jo sukhaant hone par bhi du:khad sambhaavnaaon se bhare hai evam ek sandhya vaataavaran kii sristi karte hai
 These joyous sorrow plays are termed as romance or Shakespeare's last plays
 shakespeare ke sukhaant naatakon kii apni nijee visheshtaayen hai
 Although Platus is followed in 'the Comedy of Errors', other pleasant dramas are completely different from the ancient classical plays
 inkaa uddeshy prahasan dwaara kurupataaon kaa mitaanaa tathaa trutiyon kaa sudhaar karnaa nahin varan rochak katha or charitrachitran dwaara logon kaa manoranjan karnaa he
 The theme of almost all such plays is such intense feeling of love that spontaneously arises in the minds of young men and women
 premi janon ke maarg main pehle to baadhaayen utpann hoti hai kintu naatak ke ant tak kathinaaiyaan vinasht ho jaati hai or unka parinaam sampann hota he
 In these compositions, there is a poetic and imaginative expression of life and the whole atmosphere is full of joy
 shakespeare kaa parichay katipay ucchwargeey pariwaron se ho gaya tha or unamem jis prakaar kaa jivan unhone dekha usee kaa prakaashan in naatakon main kiya he
 The grief plays highlight the serious problems of human life
 in naatakon ke abhijaat kulotpann nayak kuch samay tak safalataa or unnati ke maarg par agrasar hone ke uparaant yatnaa or vinaash ke shikaar banate hai
 Shakespeare's opinion on the subject of what causes his grief and death is clearly expressed
 nayak kaa durbhaagya anshat: pratikul niyati evam paristhitiyon se udbhoot he, kintu isse kahin bada kaaran uski charitrik durbalata main miltaa he
 In ancient Greek tragedies, the protagonist was only decimated by faulty judgment or flawed attitudes, but, perhaps influenced by Christianity and moralism, Shakespeare placed the principal responsibility for the hero's downfall on his character in his plays
 hamelet, athelo, lier or makebeth - in sabhi ke swabhaav athwa charitra main aisi kami milti he jo unke ksht evam mrityu kaa kaaran banati he
 In these sad plays, dual duality is reflected, internal duality and multi-duality
 aantarik dwandv nayak ke man main, uske vichaaron or bhaawanaaon main utpann hota he or apni tivrata ke kaaran na keval nirnay kathin bana detaa he apitu kuch samay ke liye nayak kaa asul vichlit bhi kar detaa he
 This type of internal duality has led to the emergence of psychological subtlety and interestingness in plays
 bahya dwandv bahari shaktiyon kii spardhaa or unke sangharsh se utpann hota he, jaise do virdohi raajnneetik dalon athwa senaaon kaa parsparik virodh
 In Shakespeare's major grief plays, the atmosphere of bloodshed and horrific scenes has created a very terror environment
 isi bhanti hatya or pratishodh sambandhi drishyon ke samavesh se bhi avsaad kaa put gaharaa ho gaya he
 Shakespeare took all these features and instruments from certain old plays and playwrights such as Seneca, Kid, Marlow, and used them in his plays, keeping in mind the occasional public interest
 du:khant naatakon kii jin visheshtaon kaa ullekh hamane yahan kiya he ve na keval hamelet, athelo, king lier, or makebeth main milti hai varan romeo and juliet tathaa england or rome ke itihaas par aadhrut du:khant naatakon main bhi aanshik rup main vidyaman hai
 Many of the historical plays that Shakespeare composed are Roman historians
 in roman naatakon ke lekhan main shakespeare ne itihaas ke tathyon ko thodaa bahut badal diya he or katipay sthalon par aisa prathit hone lagata he ki jivan kaa jo chitra upasthit kiya gaya he vah pracheen rome kaa nahin apitu alizveth kaaleen england kaa he
 Despite this, these plays have always been popular, especially Julius Caesar and Antoine & Cleopatra
 antony aid cleopatra kavitvapurn anshon sa bharaa padaa he tathaa cleopatra kii charitrakalpana atyant prabhavotpadak he
 The events of Greek history are represented in the Times of Athens and Perikiles
 angreji itihaas par aadhaarit naatakon main kuch to aise hai jo keval aanshik rup main shakespeare dwaara likhe gaye hai kintu henry chaturth ke donon bhaag or henry pancham purna roopen shakespeare dwaara pranit hai
 The poet has achieved great success in these three plays
 inamen shaury or sammanbhaavna kaa atyant aakarshak pratipaadan hua he or phalstaff kaa charitra atyant rochak evam spruhaniya hai
 Marlow has been successfully imitated in Richard III and Richard II
 shakespeare ke purv ke adhikansh angreji aitihaasik naatakon main tathyon or ghatnaon kaa nirjeev chithran rahata tha tathaa kori itivrittatmakataa ke kaaran ve neeras hote the
 Shakespeare has made these types of plays come alive by making them miraculous
 antim naatakon main shakespeare kaa paripakv jeevandarshan miltaa he
 Mahakavi had different experiences in his life, which is reflected in his creations
 pranay vishyak sukhaant naatakon main kalpanavilas he or kavi kaa man aishwarya or yauvan kii vilasita main rama he
 Grief plays express such sad experiences that make life toxic
 shakespeare ke krititv kii parinti aise naatakon kii rachana main hui jinamein unki samyak buddhi kaa pratifalan hua he
 The poet now sees with his prudent view that both happiness and sorrow remain embedded in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: donon hi kshanik hai
 Happiness comes after grief in life, so equality in thought and behavior is desirable
 in antim naatakon se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki hinsa or pratishodh kii apeksha dayaa or kshamaa adhik shlaghneey hai
 These plays have special significance due to their serious moral message
 shakespeare ke naatak svachhndathawadi hai tathaa pracheen unani or latin naatakon kii parampara se pruthak hai
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to find classical features of object in them
 keval apane antim naatak 'di tempast' main unhone teenon anvitiyon kaa nirvaah kiya he
 In almost all other plays, only the implementation has been taken care of, in terms of time and place, they are absolutely essays
 kathavstu main sadaiv paryaapt vistaar miltaa he or saamanyat: usamen kai kathaayen antarnihit rahati hai
 For example, we can take a Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Merchant on Venice, As You Like It or King Lear
 in sabhi main anek kathaon ke mishran dwaara vastunirmaan sampann hua he
 But this does not mean that the design of Shakespeare's plays is flawed
 ant:kathaon kaa natyavastu main sundar, kalapurna reeti se gunfan kiya gaya he tathaa sampurna kathanak se sankalit ekta kaa abhas miltaa he
 In spite of the lack of inventions in the classical sense, emotional and imaginative integration has taken place in these romantic plays
 patrakalpana main shakespeare ko or bhi adhik safalataa mili he
 In his plays he has created many fascinating characters who come before us in their lively form
 samay ke saath charitranirupan kii prakriya adhikadhik sookshm evam kalatmak hoti gai
 For example, we can take Rosalin, Porcia, Viartrus, Rosalind, Vayala Prabhriti Pragalbha, women included in the Sukhanta plays, who constantly introduce their sharp intellect and speech
 duusari koti kii ve naariyaan hai jinke anupam saundarya or sankatpurna anubhavon ke kaaran man main karunaa kaa udrek hota he
 The major among such females are Juliet, Ophilia, Desdimona, Cardilia, Imogen etc
 du:khant naatakon main charitrachitran kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 For example, we can take Hamlet
 naatak kii samast ghatnaayen nayak ke charitra par kendrit hai or usee ke vyaktitv ke prabhaav se katha kaa vikaas hota he
 Partially the same is true for other sad plays
 pracheen unani naatakon main anek smaraneey paatr milte hai kintu naitik or manovaigyanik upkarnon ke sahare ankit kiye hue shakespeare ke pramukh paatr kahin adhik rochak evam aakarshak hai
 The characterization of grief plays has become even more miraculous with the use of internal duality
 shakespeare ke naatakon ke kuch anya paatr bhi ullekhneey hai jaise vidooshak or khalanaayak
 Among the clowns, Falstaff Touchstone, Feste and King Lear's loyal clowns are important
 khalnaayakon main richard tritiy, iyago, edmund iatiyon aadi kii gananaa hoti he
 As Hazlitt wrote, the power of Shakespeare shows that not only is his character distinguished but his majority of minor characters also hold their own personal importance
 yadhyapi shakespeare ke naatakon main kahin kahin gadhy kaa prayog hua he, tab bhi ve mulat: kaavyatmak he
 Most of his part is stitched
 yahi nahin, praaia: sabhi natya rachanaayen kaavyatmak gunon se bhari padi hai
 Shakespeare has created an enchanting effect by the production of imagination, figurative expressions, musical rhythms and gentle emotions
 pracheen kaal se naatakon kaa kavita kaa ek bhed maatr maanate aae the or shakespeare ne pracheen dharna sweekaar kii
 Prose has been used occasionally for special purposes
 kintu saamaanya rup se ham shakespeare ke naatakon ko kavyanaty kii sangya de sakate hai
 Poetry was excessive initially, but shanai: shanai: his form became restrained and he began to control the idea of purpose
 isi bhanti shakespeare kii style main samavisht karne ke liye nirantar prayaas kiya; falat: praarambhik naatakon main vistrut varnanon ev sundar rupakon kaa bahulya he apni pratibha kii praudhavastha main jab shakespeare apane prasiddh du:khant naatakon kii rachana kar rahe the us samay tak unki style santulit ho gai thi
 In primary stage, expression was more important and ideas were less important
 kintu is madhyamik kaal main vichaaron, bhaavon tathaa abhivyakti ke sadhano kaa samyak samanvay hua he
 This balanced system focused on Shakespeare's ideas and moral paradigms in the last years and ignored stylistic miracles
 isiilie antim naatakon kii style kahin kahin angadh ho gai he
 Shakespeare wrote his plays primarily for theater, although we also enjoy reading from him because of his poetic qualities
 tatkaaleen rangamanch kii banaavat abhinay kii vyavastha, darshakon kii lokaruchi, in sabhi kaa prabhaav shakespeare ke natyanirmaan par padaa
 Two examples will suffice

 Location, time and situation were indicated by these descriptions
 naatakon main swagat evam swabhaashit kaa nirantar upyog isiilie sambhav ho sakaa ki rangamanch kaa aglaa trikonakar bhaag prekshkon ke bich tak aage badha rahata tha
 Shakespeare did the surgeon for many male and female characters only because his suitable actors were available
 darshakon ke manoranjanarth anek drishyon kii avatarana hui he jiname rangamanch par uttejk evam manoranjak paristhitiyon kaa pradarshan hua he
 Like today's realistic theater, the Elizabethan era theater was bound by abundant means and fixed arrangements
 abhinay or pradarshan donon hi apekshaakrit unmukt the, isliye shakespeare ke naatakon main paryaapt rujuta milti he
 In almost all types of plays, Mahakavi has embodied lyrical freedoms that are unique for their beauty and melody
 inke atirikt shakespeare kii vistrut kavitaayen hai, jinamein 'vinas and adonis', 'di rape aav lukris' tathaa sanets kaa ullekh aavashyak he
 All these works belong to the last decade of the 16th century when Shakespeare's heart was charmed by the effects of beauty and love
 'vinas and adonis' main ek pracheen premakatha ko atyant kaavyatmak reeti se varnit kiya gaya he
 'the Rape of Lucreus' tells the story of the misfortune and death of a supremely beautiful Roman woman
 sanets main kuch aise hai jo kavi ke ek mitra se sambandh rakhte hai jisane vivaah na karne kaa nishchay kar liya tha
 Shakespeare, referring to his form and qualities, urges him to change his determination
 saneton kaa doosraa kram ek shyamvarn mahila se sambandhit he jise prati kavi ke man main teevr aakarshan utpann hua tha kintu jisane us sneh kaa aadar na karke kavi ke us mitra ko apana pranay diya, jisko dhyaan main rakhkar saneton kaa pratham kram likhaa gaya tha
 The question of whether Shakespeare has published his inner feelings in these sennets or whether they are merely traditional works is highly disputed

 Sir Humphrey Davy tried to separate the metal from alumia soil in 1807, but was not successful
 san 1825 main arsted ne aluminium chloride ko potacium sanras ke saath garam kiya or phir aswan karke paare ko uda diya
 There was a sparkle of metal in the powder that remained after doing this
 yahi dhaatu aluminium kahalaai
 In 1845, Frederick Wöhler used potassium metal as a reducing agent in the preparation of this metal
 use is dhaatu ke kuch chote-chote kan mili, jinaki pariksha karke usne bataaya ki yah nai dhaatu bahut halki he or iske taar khinche ja sakate hai
 Subsequently, in 1854, Devil prepared a good amount of this metal using sodium and sodium aluminum chloride
 us samay nai dhaatu hone ke kaaran aluminium kii ginati bahumoolya dhaatuon main kii jaati thi or iskaa upyog abharanon or alankaaron main hota tha
 In 1886, Charles Martin Hall in Ohio City isolated alumina mixtures in a smelled cryolite and an aluminum metal from it by electrification

 When the electrolyte is formed, the aluminum metal formed is heavier than the cryolite, hence settling down in the cell
 yah dhaatu hi runagra kaa kaam karti he
 The corroded metal is periodically flushed out of the cell
 cell main bich-bich main aavashyaktaanusaar or alumina milaate jate hai
 To reduce the melting point of cryolite, it is often added with a little calcium fluoride

 At its peak, the Viharas had the ability to accommodate hundreds
 yahan shikshak or chaatr ek saath rahete the
 It is very sad that no cave of Vakataka stage is complete
 yah is kaaran hua ki shaasha vaakatak vansh ekaek shaktiviheen ho gaya, jisase uski praja bhi sankat main aa gayi
 Due to this, all activities were interrupted and stopped suddenly

 This is a first step and has no meaning in the sequence of other caves
 yah ashwanal aakaar kii dhaal par purvi ore se pratham gupha he
 According to Spink one of the last caves built at this site is towards the end of the Vakataka phase
 haalaanki koi shilalekhith sakshya upasthit nahin hai; phir bhi yah mana jaataa he ki vaakatak raja harisena is uttam sangrakshit gupha ke sangrakshak rahe hon
 The main reason for this is that Harisena was not initially involved in the protection of Ajanta, but could not stay away from them for a long time, because this site was full of activities during his reign and his Buddhist subjects were given this sacred work of that Hindu king

 Its level was relatively high

 The absence of the pillared cells at the end suggests that this pavilion was not built with the last phase of Ajanta, when the pillared cells had become a regular part

 Rather, the carving of the panels also looks different from that

 Yes, it definitely resembles the first cave in size, shape and land plan

 tripitak Kathavatthu is a static Buddhist text
 yah sthavir moggaliputt tiss dwaara rachit he tathaa iskaa samay lagbhag teesri shatabdi isa purv mana jaataa he
 100 years after Buddha's Mahaparinirvana, the Vajjiputak monks violated the discipline of the Sangha and established a sect called 'mahasanghik' in which five more branches later emerged
 pehle jis buddha dharm ko pratham sangeeti main ek nishchit rup praapt hua tha, usamen ashok ke samay tak aate-aate 11 sampradaay or udit ho gaye the
 Thus, it is believed that BC By the third century, a total of 18 sects had come into preaching in Buddhism

 From this time onwards, this book began to be considered part of the Abhidhammapitaka
 is granth main virdohi sampradaayon ke 216 siddhanton kaa khandan he jise 23 adhyyon main vibhakt kiya gaya he, kintu ukt virdohi sampradaayon kaa namollekh isamen nahin miltaa
 The names of those sects can be traced to a fifth-century treatise written by Acharya Buddhaghosa titled 'kathavatthu Atthakatha' in which the dismantled 216 doctrines are also separately associated with the 17 sects
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki kathavatthu main kuch ashokaparvarti sampradaayon ke bhi darshanik siddhanton kaa niraakaran miltaa he
 It is completely clear that the names of the sects are not mentioned in the Kathavatthu
 at: yah anumaan swaabhaavik he ki moggaliputt tiss ke samay main jo siddhant jivit the, ve hi baad main sampradaay rup main viksit ho gaye
 The followings of this Kathavatthu later developed into a cult form
 is kathavatthu kaa anuvartan baad ke dipawans or mahavans jaise granthon main miltaa he
 Kathavatthu is also believed to have substantial influence over Bhadanta Nagasena, the Upadesha of the famous Buddhist book named Milind Panho, composed in the first century CE
 anek logon kaa mat he ki milind panhon ke rachayita bhadant nagsen hi the
 In this way, the importance of Kathavaththu is absolutely acceptable from the point of view of Stellarism, theoretical introduction of anti-tadistism, history of their rise etc

 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers
 vah kheti se nafrat karte the
 Master Henry Stokes of King's School asked his mother to send him back to school so that he could complete his education
 skool ke ek ladke ke khilaaf badla lene kii ichha se prerit hone kii vajah se ve ek sheersh kram ke chaatr ban gaye
 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years
 unhone us prabhaav ke liye latin shabd gravitas kaa istemaal kiya jise gurutv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or saarvatrik gurutvkarshan ke niyam ko paribhaashit kiya
 In this work, he presented the first analytical proof of the speed of sound in air, based on Boyle's law
 bahut adhik duuri par kriya kar sakane vaale ek adrishy bal kii newton kii avadharana kii vajah se unki aalochana hui, kyonki unhone vigyaan main "gupt agenciyon" ko mila diya tha
 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views
 unhone ek pandulipi jon loke ko bheji jisamen unhone trinity ke astitv ko vivaadit mana tha, jise kabhi prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window
 1696 main newton shahi taksaal ke warden kaa pad sanbhaalane ke liye landan chale gaye, yah pad unhen rajkosh ke tatkaaleen kuladhipati, helifax ke pehle arl, charles montagu ke sangrakshan ke madhyam se praapt hua
 He took over as the chief currency mover of England, somehow dancing at the behest of Master Lucas
 1699 main lucas kii mrityu newton shaayad taksaal ke sabase prasiddh master bane, is pad par newton apni mrityu tak bane rahe
ye niyuktiyaan daayitvaheen pad ke rup main lee gayin thim, lekin newton ne unhen gambhirtha se liya, 1701 main apane cambridge ke kartavyon se sevanivruth ho gaye or mudra main sudhaar laane kaa prayaas kiya tathaa kataranon tathaa nakli mudra banane waalon ko apni shakti kaa prayog karke sajaa di
 In "la of Queen Anne" as master of the mint in 1717, Newton inadvertently established the pound sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard, establishing a metallic relationship between silver money and gold coins in favor of gold
 Changed
 is kaaran se chaandi sterling sikke ko pighla kar britain se baahar bhej diya gaya
 Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Academic des Sciences
 royal sosayadi main apane pad par rahete hue, newton ne royal khagolvid jon flemustid ko shatru bana liya, unhone flemustid kii historica cholestis britanika ko samay se pehle hi prakashit karvaa diya, jise newton ne apane adhyayan main kaam main liya tha
 In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit at Trinity College, Cambridge
 yah nite kii padavi newton ko taksaal ke master ke rup main apni sevaao ke liye nahin di gayi thi or na hi unke vaigyanik kaary ke liye di gayi thi balki unhen yah oopaadhi may 1705 main sansadeey chunaav ke dauraan unke rajanithik yogadan ke liye di gayi thi
 Newton died in London on 31 March 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey
 unki aadhi-bhatiji, catherine barton konduit, ne landan main jarmin street main unke ghar par saamaajik maamalon main unki paricharika kaa kaam kiya; ve uske "bahut pyaare ankal" the, aisa zikr unke us patr main kiya gaya he jo newton ke dwaara use tab likhaa gaya jab vah chechak kii beemaari se ubar rahi thi
 In his final years, Newton, who had no children, took over most of his property by his relatives and died intestate
 unki mrityu ke baad, newton ke sharir main baari maatra main paara paaya gaya, jo shaayad unke rasinic vyavsaay kaa parinaam tha
 Mercury poisoning may explain the eccentricities in Newton's last life
 french ganitagya joseph louis lagrange aksar kehete the ki newton mahanatam pratibhashali tha or ek baar unhone kaha ki vah "sabase zyada bhaagyashaalee bhi tha kyonki ham duniya kii pranali ko ek se zyada baar sthapit nahin kar sakate
" angreji kavi alexander pope ne newton kii uplabdhiyon ke dwaara prabhavit hokar prasiddh smriti-lekh likhaa: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries
 baad kii vyakhya uski khojon par kai anya vivaadon ke saath bhi upyukt he, jaisaa ki yah prashn ki kalan kii khoj kisne kii, jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he
 Later in history, Newton wrote: main nahin jaanata ki main duniya ko kis rup main dikhaai duungaa lekin apane aap ke liye main ek aisa ladkaa hoon jo samudr ke kinare par khel rahaa he or apane dhyaan ko ab or tab main laga rahaa he, ek adhik chikna pathar yaa ek adhik sundar khol dhundne kii koshish kar rahaa he, sachai kaa yah itnaa bada samudr mere saamne ab tak khoja nahin gaya he
 Newton's memorial can be seen at Westminster Abbey, just north of the entrance to the choir opposite the choir screen
 ise murtikar maaikel rigbrake ne safed or dhoosar sangemarmar main banaaya he, jiskaa dizin vaastukar wiliam kaint dwaara banaaya gaya he
 In this memorial, Newton's figure rests on a stone tomb, his right elbow resting on several of his great books, and his left hand pointing to a catalog containing a mathematical design
 unke upar ek pyramid he or ek khagoleey globe raashi chakra ke sanketon tathaa 1680 ke dhoomaketu kaa rasta dikhaa rahaa he
 a relief panel is describing the putty, using instruments such as telescopes and prisms
