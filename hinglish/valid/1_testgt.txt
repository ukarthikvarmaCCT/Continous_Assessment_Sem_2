 By the time Master Chiff reaches Keez, it is late and Kiz is completely under the control of the Floods
 master chiff unhe maar kar unke neural implatan nikaal let he or cortana ship kaa self distrakshan seqvence chaalu kar detii he
 But then 343 guilt sparks stop counting and together we learn human history

 The number of rotating cups increases as the wind moves
 ganitr bhi mile yaa kilometre main pyaaliyon kii chaal kaa abhilekh prastut karata he, jaisaa teximetre main hota he
 To find the velocity of the wind in a particular period, in a period of six minutes, the calculator knows the difference between the speed of the mile or kilometer and the cup in its divisions
 is antar ko das se guna karne par veg mile yaa kilometre prati ghanta main maaloom ho jaataa he
 Thus, the total speed is recorded with this device at the desired time interval
 at: kisi thode samay main pawan ke jhonkon yaa jhakkadon kaa veg isse maapna sambhav nahin he, kyonki inaki prabalata alpakaalik, praaia: ek minute se bhi kam samay kii, hoti he

 parivarti kshetrafal vidhi se jis dhwani kaa aalekhan karnaa he usko microphone kii sahaayta se vidyucchumbakeey tarangon main parivartit kar dete hai
 These electromagnetic waves are amplified with the help of an amplifier
 pravardhan ke atirikt yaheen par dhwani ke anek anya lakshanon kaa, jaise tivrata aadi, niyantran kiya jaataa he
 After this, the electromagnetic signals of the sound are given on a dielectric so that the mirror of the soundometer oscillates here and there
 darpan par kisi sthir tivratavaale prakashasrot kaa prakaash ek prakaashik vyavastha dwaara kendrit kiya jaataa he
 When reflected from the mirror, this light falls through another optical plant onto a film strip and is photographed here
 microphone par padanevaali dhwani kii aavriti or tivrata ke anuroop vidyucchumbakeey sanket jab dharamapi par padate hai, to iske darpan ke bhi dolan is dhwani parivartan se sambandhit hote hai
 Due to the oscillation of the mirror, the light, which is reflected by this mirror and passes through the optical plants, falls on the film, shading in different area
 yahan kshetrafal main parivartan microphone par padanevaali dhwani ke hi kaaran hota he, at: yah parivartan us dhwani ke sangat bhi hota he
 Here the volume of Kalima in sound shading remains the same everywhere, only the intensity of the black area changes, so this method is called variable field method
 parivarti ghanatv vidhi se sthir tivratavaale prakashasrot kaa prakaash ek aise prakaash valve par padataa he jo die gaye sanketon ke anuroop kam yaa adhik prakaash pargamit karata he
 On this valve, signals generated by the microphone and amplified by the amplifier are given
 falswaroop is valve se nikalanevaale prakaash kii tivrata microphone par padanevaali dhwani ke anuroop parivartit hoti rahati he
 When this light is shaded on the film, although the area of shading remains the same, the density of its blackness changes, so this method is called variable density method
 dhwani punarutpaadan kaa siddhant, dhwani aalekhan kaa lagbhag ulta he
 The strip of the film, over which the plotting of the sound is in the form of a shadow, passes over a drum
 is drum kaa kaary keval film kii gati kii sambhav aniyamittaaon ko dur karnaa he
 The light emanating from a stationary intensity source is focused on the soundtracked portion of the film through a narrow line through the optical plant
 isse hokar guzaranevaale prakaash kii tivrata main dhvanialekhith bhaag ke kaalepan ke anuroop parivartan hota he
 This change would obviously correspond to the sound on the microphone
 is prakaar parivarti tivrata kaa prakaash ek prakaash-vidyut-cell, yaa photosal par padataa he
 An electrode is generated in the circuit of this photocell, which changes with the intensity of light incident on the photocell
 is parivarti vidyudwara se photocel ke paripath main jo vidyucchumbakeey sanket utpann hote hai, unhen pravardhak dwaara pravardhit kiya jaataa he tathaa baad main un sanketon ko ek laudspikar par dete hai, jo parde ke peeche rakhaa rahata he
 The sound produced by the loudspeaker due to these amplified signals corresponds to the sound that was on the microphone
 uparyukt chhayankan kii vidhi main dhwani kaa punarutpaadan bahut ucch koti kaa nahin hota
 Although the drafting done by this method in a movie studio may still be of a higher quality, the reproduction of sound in movie theaters may not be as high
 punarutpaadit dhwani main aavriti kii ucchtam seemaa praaia: 7,000 hi ho paati thi
 But a major advantage of this method was that due to optical shading, it could be printed on the film strip along with printing
 prakashvidhi kii kathinaaiyaan dur karne ke liye vaigyanikon ne chumbakeey dhwani aalekh evam punarutpaadan vidhi kaa sahaara liya
 The principle of this method is similar to the principle of tape recorder
 jis dhwani kaa aalekhan karnaa hota he usko sarvapratham ek microphone kii sahaayta se vidyucchumbakeey tarangon main parivartit karke ek pravardhak dwaara pravardhit karte hai
 These amplified signals are then sent to the coil of an electromagnet
 is kundal main dhara kaa maan praapt sanketon ke anusaar parivartit hota he tathaa is dhara ke maan ke anusaar vidyucchumbak kii chumbakeey tivrata main bhi parivartan hota he
 The distance between the two poles of this electromagnet is very short, so the intensity of the magnetic field between them is very high and the change in current flowing in its coil also causes more change in field intensity
 is vidyut chumbak ke atyant nikat se ek tepe gujarata he, jisapar kisi chumbakeey padaarth, jaise louh oxide, kaa lep chadha rahata he
 The magnetic properties of the coated magnetic material on this tape change when passing through the face of the electromagnet, corresponding to the change in magnetism of the electromagnet and since the change in magnetism of the electromagnet corresponds to the sound on the microphone, the tape The change in magnetic properties also corresponds to the sound on the microphone
 is vidhi se tepe par dhwani kaa chumbakeey aalekhan ho jaataa he
 When the same tape is run in front of an electromagnet for production, the corresponding current in its hinges changes accordingly
 dhara kaa yah parivartan ek pravardhak dwaara pravardhit karke laudspikar par dene se dhwani kaa punarutpaadan hota he
 For plotting this method on the film it is necessary that a magnetic material is coated on one side of the film
 saath hi pradarshan grih main punarutpaadan ke liye prakashastrot evam photocel ke sthaan par chumbakeey head kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 In modern times the size of the performance of many movies is different from an ordinary picture
 cinemascope, sinerama, vistavijan aadi naamon se prachlit vidhiyon main pradarshit chitra kii chaudaai bahut adhik hoti he
 With this method if the sound-reproduction-method described above is used in which the same loudspeaker is used, a difficulty arises whether the source of the sound on the screen is on the right or on the left end
 , Or anywhere in between, the sound will always seem to be coming from the same place where the loudspeaker is placed
 yadi is vidhi main kai laudspikar samaantar main lagaae jaaen, jo puure parde kii chaudaai main vitarit hon tab bhi puure parde par se samaan dhwani aegi jabaki bolanewaala kahin ek hi sthaan par hoga
 Stereophonic sound instruments are used to overcome this difficulty
 is vidhi main dhwani aalekhan ke samay vibhinn sthalon par rakhe hue kai microphone kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jinaki sankhya praaia: chaar se saat tak hoti he
 The signals generated from each microphone are separately amplified and written separately on the plotting bar
 is prakaar dhwani aalekhan kai trinkon par hota he or ise bahut trek recordig kehete hai
 At the time of reproduction also the plotting of different tracks from different magnetic heads converts into electromagnetic signals, then amplifies them with separate amplifiers
 ant main in sanketon ko alag alag laudspikaron par dete hai
 Each loudspeaker is positioned such that its position corresponds to the position of the corresponding microphone
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi dhwani aalekhan ke samay ek microphone stage ke ek dam baayein kone par rakhaa he, to us dhwani ke punarutpaadit karanevaala laudspikar bhi parde ke peeche ek dam baayein rakhaa jayega
 Similarly, other loudspeakers will also be distributed according to compatible microphones
 ab kalpana kiijie ki dhwani aalekhan ke samay stage ke baayein sire par dhwani utpann hoti he, tab vahaan rakhe microphone main dhwani kii tivrata sab se adhik hogi tathaa kramash: dur hote gaye microphone main tivrata kramash: kam hoti jaaegi
 Since the leftmost loudspeaker in the drafting and reproduction period will produce the loudest sound and the farthest loudspeaker will produce lighter sound respectively
 atev falswaroop darshak ko dhwani parden kii bain ore se aati prathit hogi
 Similarly, the signal in the microphone placed closest to the part of the stage in which the sound will be produced in the sound recording period will be the loudest and in the reproduction period it will produce the maximum sound from the corresponding loudspeaker
 at: dhwani bhi chitra ke usee bhaag se aati prathit hogi, jahaan dhwani utpann hoti jaan padati he
 The more and clearer the tracks, the more real sound reproduction will be
 parantu vyay evam vyaavhaarik kathinaaiyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue praayogic rup main saat trek tak upyog main aate hai

 Switching times range from tens of nanoseconds to a few hundred microseconds, depending on the device
 MOSFET drain source resistances increase as more current flows through the device
 As frequencies increase the losses increase as well, making bjts more attractive
 Power mosfets can be paralleled in order to increase switching current and therefore overall switching power
 Nominal voltages for MOSFET switching devices range from a few volts to a little over 1000 V, with currents up to about 100 a or so
 Newer devices may have higher operational characteristics
 MOSFET devices are not bi-directional, nor are they reverse voltage blocking
 An example of this new device from ABB shows how this device improves on GTO technology for switching high voltage and high current in power electronics applications
 According to ABB, the IGCT devices are capable of switching in excess of 5000 VAC and 5000 a at very high frequencies, something not possible to do efficiently with GTO devices

 inase kai boliyon ko bada bal mila kyonki sumeri shabdon ke unke lipichihon ke saath babuli or asuri main bhi paryaay prastut ho gaye
 As a result, in Assuri, despite its Semitic and Semantic languages, the Sumerian words became plentiful, and as written in the Sumeri script, its pronunciation also became archaic and non-translucent

 The book titled Geetarahasya was written by Lokmanya Balagangadhar Tilak in Mandla Jail
 isamen unhone shrimadbhagavadgita ke karmyog kii vrihad vyakhya kii
 He told through this book that Gita Chintan is not for those who, after spending a selfish worldly life, sit at leisure and start reading books
 gita rahasy main yah darshaniktaa nihit he ki hamen mukti kii ore drushti rakhte hue sansaarik kartavya kaise karne chahie
 In this book, he has made man aware of the real duties in his world
 tilak ne gitarahasya likhi hi isliye thi ki vah maan nahin paa rahe the ki gita jaisaa granth keval moksh kii ore le jaataa he
 It only appeals to leave the world
 vah to karm ko centre main laana chaahate the
 That was probably the demand of the time
 jab desh gulam ho, tab aap apane logon se moksh kii baat nahin kar sakate
 They have to be engaged in karma
 vahi tilak ne kiya
 Gandhiji was a great admirer of Geeta
 use vah apni mata kehete the
 He too had read Geetarasya and said that this Tilakji commentary on Gita is his eternal memorial

 It was a period of slavery of the British
 1910 ke navambar kii shuruyaat hi hui thi
 Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak was imprisoned in the Mandalay jail of Burma
 vahiin par ek subah unhone mahasoos kiya ki barason se jis gita par likhnaa chaahate the, vah samay aa gaya he
 He could not get any time from his heavy political life
 lekin jab bhi vah jail main hote, to gita unke jehan main chali aati
 He was highly influenced by Geeta
 lekin uski vyatraya ko le kar pareshaan rahete the
 According to his time and society, he wanted to see and understand the Gita
 ek thake hue gulam samaaj ko jagaane ke liye vah gita ko sanjivani bananaa chaahate the
 When he got a third major jail, he started working on it
 vah kaam, jisaki neenv bahut pehle shaayad unke man par pad gai thi
 At the age of 16, he had recited the Gita in Marathi to his mortal father
 tabhi se gita ko lekar ek kism kaa lagaav ho gaya tha
 Later, when age began to grow slowly and understanding began to grow, all the secrets of the Gita began to unravel
 unhen dikkat yah hui ki gita kii tamaam tikaaen sansar se dur le janevaali yani nivritti maarg dikhaane vaali thim
 And Tilak's mind was not ready to believe that a book like Gita is just going to lead you to salvation
 aakhir arjuna ko yuddh ke liye taiyaar karanevaali gita nire moksh kii baat kaise kar sakati he! isiilie unhone kaha, "mul gita nivritti pradhan nahin he
 He is karma head
 " In just five months, he wrote Geetarahasya with pencil
 ek daur main lagata tha ki shaayad british hukumat unke likhe ko jabt hi kar le
 But he had great faith in his memory
 isiilie apane bandhuon se kaha tha, "darane kaa koi kaaran nahin
 Although the books are with the government
 lekin to bhi granth kaa ek-ek shabd mere dimag main he
 i will rewrite it while sitting in my bungalow at rest
