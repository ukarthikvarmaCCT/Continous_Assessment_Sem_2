uske netron se neend sadaa ke liye vidaa ho gai he
 When Gautama Buddha left, Yashodhara remembers his predecessor and says - unmaad kii sthiti main yashodhara 'jaao mere sir ke bal' kahkar apane edichambi sundar keshon ko kaat daalati he or rahul ko apane bahupash main itane jor se jakad leti he ki uskaa dam ghutane lagata he
 In fact, the unhappiness of separation becomes inevitable when - "I wake up
 " vah apane vanamali ko bulaati he- vah bhi jaldi kyonki use bhay he ki kahin 'aankhon kaa panchi' unke aane se purv hi na ud jaay, kintu gopa ko turant hi bodh hota he ki sneh to jalane ke liye bana he or yah deh sab kuch sahane ke liye bani he
 Yashodhara's tears are so valuable that Shuddhodhana is ready to leave him to 'mukti Mukta'
 virahinee yashodhara vrath rakhti he, fate-puraane vastra pahenti he
 Thus Yashodhara, deprived of royalty, is living only in the concern of Gautama
 'na jane kitni barasaatein biit gai' par gopa ke din nahin phire
 She assesses the value of happiness with heat and cold breath
 use vishwaas he ki uske khalane vaale din avashya cat jaayenge or khilne vaale din avashya aayenge or tab vah ek din prabhu kaa darshan avashya kar paayenge
 That is why she sometimes refuses to let her nayana be in vain because she feels that there is nothing in this cry
 anuraagini ke rup mem yashodhara kaa charitra nikhar uthaa he
 The specialty of her character is that despite being anuragini, she is a human being
 vah apane pati se jitna anuraag rakhti he utana bhi maan rakhti he
 In fact, she is a worshiper of her husband-god like Meera
 vaishnav-bhakthi main maan, darp, upalambh aadi ko mahatvapurn sthaan diya gaya he
 Yashodhara also has a statement- yashodhara kaa janani rup uske anuraagini rup se bhi adhik mukherit he
 The only support for a woman separated from her husband is her son
 yashodhara kii 'malin gooddi kaa laal', 'uske sharir kaa anraag', 'aankhon kaa anjan', 'vipakti kaa sahaara', 'jivan-naiya kaa khivaiyaa', 'dukhini kaa sukh', 'uskaa bhaiya', 'uskaa raja' sabhi kuch rahul he
 If Gautam has snatched up this support of hers, she too would walk through the jungles of the forest like Vaishali, the heroine of Shri Govindavallabh Pant's drama 'varmala'
 iske atirikt use saas-sasur kii samvednaa or sahanubhuti praapt na hoti, to vah kabhi kii kaal ke gaal main samaa gai hoti
 Yashodhara lives because Rahul's weight is on him and his mother-in-law's sympathy is with him
 yashodhara kavy main jis prakaar yashodhara kaa janani rup nikharaa he usee prakaar uskaa maanini rup bhi
 When Lord Buddha came to Magadha after receiving Gyan, Shuddhodhana and Mahaprajavati explain to Yashodhara many times that she should submit to her husband's darshan
 kintu vah iske liye prastut nahin hoti
 She realizes that she has not left her husband
 uske pati hi usase chhipakar ghar se nikal gaye
 So they should come to him only
 jab uske saas sasur usase magadh chalane kaa aagrah karte jate hai to maanini yashodhara aavesh main aakar moorchhit ho jaati hai
 When Gautam Buddha visits Kapilavastu, Manini is now sitting where her loved ones have left her
 vah samajhaati he ki jab unhen isht hoga tab swayan aakar yaa bulaakar ve use apane charnon main sthaan denge
 This is also what happens

 "it was our intention to be honest with this book
" Rosenberg explained, "and it has less to do with the verbatim conversion and more to ensure that the characters' portrayal and their emotional journey remain the same
" Hardwicke suggests a lateral tone for the main character's internal dialogue - since the novel is narrated from Bella's point of view - and during the pre-production preparations she made some story-board sketches
 When they told me Rob was probably the one, i looked him up and thought, "yeah, he can do a version of Edward
 He’s definitely got that vampire thing going on
" And then, when i was on set and i got to watch him go from being Rob to shifting into being Edward, and he actually looked like the Edward in my head, it was a really bizarre experience
 He really had it nailed

 To ensure an honest conversion, author Stephanie Meyer was deeply involved in the production process, inviting her during filming and even seeking commentary on the plot and rough-cuts

 They were really interested in my thoughts, "and,"

 In another form, the mean sequence of terms of {sn} is {tn} where nimna prakaar hai Therefore isliye shrenee g kaa sisera sankalan kaa maan 1 / 2 he
 In the other form, suppose n is an = n for ≥ 1
 arthath {an} ek anukram he
 And let g be a range ∑ n = 1 ∞ an = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ⋯ { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n} = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + \ cdots} represents

 At the same time, Veeram Dev of Merta adopted a policy of treachery

 Template: Network Neutrality In the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunications networks, the term traffic engineering refers to the process of resource maintenance control rather than service quality, acquired service quality
 seva kii gunvattta, vibhinn anuprayogon, upyogkartaaon, yaa data pravaah ko alag praathamikta uplabdh karaane kii kshamta, yaa data pravaah ke liye katipay nishpaadan str kii guarantee he
 For example, an expected bit rate, delay, perturbation, packet dropping probability and / or bit rate error may be guaranteed

 a network or protocol that supports qos may agree to traffic contracts including application software and reserved capacity in network nodes, for example during the session establishment phase
 During the session, it can monitor the achieved level of performance, for example data rate and delay, and scheduling preferences in network nodes dynamically
 This can release the reserve capacity during the collapse phase
 ek sarvottam-prayaas network yaa seva, seva kii gunvattta kaa samarthan nahin karata he
 An alternative to complex qos control mechanisms is to provide high-quality communication in a best-effort network by overloading capacity so that it is sufficient for the expected busiest traffic load

 Service quality in the field of telephony is defined in ITU Standard X

 qos is also used as a quality measure, sometimes including multiple alternative definitions, rather than referring to the capacity of reserved resources

 qos has an alternative and controversial definition, particularly used in application layer services such as telephony and streaming video, requirements on metrics that reflect or predict subjectively experienced quality
 is sandarbh main, qos seva ke dosha ko prabhavit karne vaale graahak santushti par sweekaarya sanchayi prabhaav he
 Other terms with the same meaning are quality of experience subjective business concept, expected "user targeted execution", expected "user satisfaction quantity" or "number of satisfied customers"
 Examples of measurement and measurement methods are medium opinion scores, perceptual speech quality measurement, and perceptual evaluation of video quality
 See also subjective video quality

 Looking at packet-switched networks, service quality appears to be influenced by various factors, which can be divided into "human" and "technical" factors
 maanviya karkon main shaamil hai: seva kii sthirataa, seva kii uplabdhta, deree, upyogkarta jaankaree
 takneekee karkon main shaamil hai: vishwasaneeyata, arohniyata, prabhaavashiltaa, anurakshaniyata, seva shrenee, aadi
 The journey from origin to destination can have many things to do with packets, which can result in the following problems from the sender and receiver point of view: katipay prakaar ke network yatayaat ke liye ek paribhaashit seva kii gunvattta aavashyak ho sakati he, udhaaharan ke liye: This type of service is called inelastic, which means that there is some minimum level of bandwidth and a certain maximum latency period to work
 iske vipareet, lochadar anuprayog uplabdh kitni bhi zyaada yaa kam bandwidth kaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 Bulk file transfer applications typically rely on TCP are elastic
 qos jatil niyantran tantron ke liye ek vikalp network ke liye udaartaa se adhik-praavdhaan ke dwaara ucch gunvattta sanchaar uplabdh karana he taaki kshamta vyastatam yatayaat bhaar anumaanon par aadhaarit ho
 This approach is simple and economical for networks with predictable and light traffic loads
 kai anuprayogon ke liye nishpaadan samuchit he
 This may also include demanding applications that can compensate for delays including bandwidth changes and large receiver buffers, which is often possible, for example in video streaming
 vanijyik voip sevaayen kol gunvattta ke maamle main paaramparik telephone seva ke saath aksar pratispardhaatmak hote hai bhale hi qos tantra aam taur par upyogkarta ke ISP par conection main or voip pradaata ke ek alag ISP conection par upyog main nahin hai
 In high-load conditions, however, voip quality degrades to cell-phone quality or worse

 yuxel or anya ne nirdhaarit kiya he ki 60% ke liye roodhiwaadee manyataon ke tahat anuroopit IP yatayaat dwaara atirikt kshamta kii aavashyaktaa he
 The need to change the amount of over-provisioning in internal links to qos depends on the number of users and their traffic demands
 is samay jab internet lagbhag ek billian upyogkartaaon ko seva pradaan karata he, bahut kam sambhaavna he ki ati-praavdhaneekaran se qos kii aavashyaktaa samaapt ho jaaegi jab voip adhik saamaanya ho jaataa he
 For more specialized narrowband networks for enterprises and local governments, however, bandwidth costs can be substantial and justification for over-provisioning can be barely proven
 in sthitiyon main, inaki apeksha rakhane vaale packeton ke liye adhimaanya upachaar kaa safal prabandh karne ke liye do alag darshan viksit kiye
 Initial work used the intserv philosophy of reservation of network resources
 is model main, anuprayogon ne network ke madhyam se sansadhano ke anurodh or aarakshan ke liye sansaadhan aarakshan protocol kaa upyog kiya
 While intserv mechanisms work, it was realized that in a broadband network typical of a large service provider, core routers would be required to approve, maintain and truncate thousands or possibly millions of reservations
 yah mana gaya ki yah drushtikon internet ke vikaas ke saath badhegaa nahin or yadi koi ghatana network dizin kii dharna ke prati virdohi ho taaki kor routers adhiktam sambhavya daron par bas packeton kii adla-badali se kuch zyada karen
 Another widely accepted approach is "diffserv" or differentiated services
 In the diffserv model, packets are characterized by the type of service they expect
 in chihnon kii pratikriya main, routers or switch nishpaadan ko apekshaaon ke anuroop banane ke liye vibhinn qatari ranneetiyon kaa upyog karte hai
 Icons use 6 bits in IP packet headers
 MAC parat main, VLAN IEEE 802
1Q or IEEE 802
1p ko anivarytah ek hi soochna le jane ke liye upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he) Routers that support diffserv use multiple queues for packets awaiting transmission from a bandwidth-restricted interface
 is vyavhaar ko vinyast karne ke liye router vikreta vibhinn kshamtaayen pradaan karte hai, taaki samarthit kataron kii sankhya, kataron kii sambandhit variyata or prayek qatari ke liye arakshit bandwidth ko shaamil kar saken
 In practice, when a packet is to be forwarded from the interface with the queue, packets that require less jettle are preferred over packets in other queues
 aam taur par, network niyantran packeton ko diphalt dwaara kuch bandwidth abantit kiya jaataa he, jabaki sarvottam prayaas vaale yatayaat ko bachaa hua bandwidth diya jaataa he
 Additional bandwidth management mechanisms can be used for more successful management of performance, including: ullekhanusaar, jabaki kai parishkrut udhyam networkon main diffserv kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, yah vyapak rup se internet par tainaat kiya gaya he
 Internet friend grouping arrangements are already complex and service providers do not see any enthusiasm for qos support across friend-group connections, or agreements regarding policies to be supported to do so
 internet par qos kii jarurat ke liye ek prabal udhaaharan sankulan patan ke is mudde se sambandhit he
 Underlying Internet TCP, congestion relies on avoidance protocols to reduce the traffic load in situations that would otherwise lead to Internet disruption
 voip or IPTV jaise qos anuprayog TCP kaa upyog nahin kar sakate, kyonki unhen adhik sthir bit-dar or kam prasupti kaal kii zarurat hoti he or anyathaa vighatan kii rokthaam main madad ke liye bhi apane yatayaat dar ko kam nahin kar sakate hai
 qos contracts limit the traffic that can be offered to the Internet and thus traffic simulation can be implemented to prevent it from becoming overloaded, so they can handle real-time and unreal-time mixed traffic without disruption
 Are an essential part of the Internet's capability

 geri bachula, Internet2 ke videshi maamalon ke upaadhyaksh, daawa karte hai ki kor network main vishisht qos protocol tab tak anaavashyak hai jab tak ki kor network link is had tak "ati-praavdhanikrut" hai ki network yatayaat ko kabhi deree kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 "seva gunvattta" ejineering main, yah sutrikaran niyantran pravesh suvidha dwaara guaranteekrut he
 The Internet2 project found in 2001 that qos protocols were probably not eligible for deployment within the Abilene network with devices available at the time
 jabaki nae routers bina nishpaadan kshati ke, qos protocol kaa anusaran karne main sakasham hai, us samay uplabdh upkarnon ne qos ko lagu karne ke liye software par nirbhar kiya
 Internet2 Abilene Network Group also predicted that "logistics, financial and organizational bottlenecks would block the passage of any bandwidth guarantees" by the protocol modifications targeted to qos
 In short they believe that best efforts by economics as a measure of network providers to pressurize customers towards expensive qos services are likely to intentionally damage traffic quality
 abylin network 2006 ke prarambh main network tatasthta par sinet vaanijya samiti kii sunwaayee main geri bachula ke liye gavaahi kaa aadhaar tha
 He expressed the opinion that it is more effective to add more bandwidth than various schemes to achieve the qos tested by him
 bachula kii gavaahi ko seva gunvattta par pratibandh lagane ke kanoon ke samarthakon dwaara saboot ke rup main uddhrut kiya gaya he ki aisi peshkash ke dwaara kisi bhi vaid uddeshy kii purti nahin hoti
 beshak yah tark is dharna par aadhaarit he ki adhik praavdhaan qos kaa koi rup nahin he or yah hameshaa sambhav he
 Clearly, cost and other factors affect the capacity of carriers in the permanent construction and maintenance of highly provisioned networks
