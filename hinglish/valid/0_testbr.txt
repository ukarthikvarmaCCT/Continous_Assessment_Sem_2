 sutron ke anusaar peshey se badhai vishwakarma ko dadar ke kabootarkhaana main hue visphot main gambhir chotein ain thim
 He went there to buy plywood
 gat shanivaar ko jeje aspataal main bhartee do ghayalon kii maut ho gai thi
 129 people were injured in the blasts
 marane waalon kii sankhya ab badhkar 24 ho gai he
 Sources said that 22 people are currently admitted in JJ Hospital, out of which six are in critical condition
 harikrishnadas aspataal main bhartee 12 ghayalon main se paanch kii haalat ab bhi gambhir he
 Neetu, who hails from Bihar, works in a factory in Ghaziabad, but at the moment her first concern is how the bank account will be opened before the gas cylinder ends, otherwise the subsidy on the cylinder will go waste
 lihaaja nitu jab gajiabad kii khodaa colony ke state bank pahunchi or jan-dhan yojana ke tahat jiro balance vaale account ke form kii maang kii to bank ne kaha uske liye janvari tak intjaar karo, lekin agar khaataa abhi khulwaanaa he to 1,100 rupee dene honge
 This situation is not limited only to the Khoda Colony of Neetu and Ghaziabad
 najar daudai jaae to desh main kai jagahon par bank khaaton ko lekar public kii aisi hi bechaargi dikhegi
 But we reviewed Khoda and Alam even showed that people are even bringing recommendations for the account form of zero balance
 state bank ne apni bheed kam karne ke liye customer sarvice point khol rakhaa he
 First, the public is persuaded to go to the customer service point, and if the public insists that the form is to be taken from the bank, then it is punished to open the account for Rs 1,100
 sansaadhan kii kami kaa ronaa ho saktaa he, lekin yahaan niyat main khot dikh rahaa he
 The banks through which the Jan Dhan Yojana was to be carried out, the same banks as if engaged in breaking the scheme
 vaise, chunauti unke saamne bhi munh baae khadi he, jo shuruaati daur main khaataa khulwaane main kaamyaab ho gaye the
 They are now wearing slippers for the passbook even after two months
 gajiabad kii factory main sample colect karne vaale arvind bataate hai ki passbook ke liye baar-baar chuttee lekar bank ke chakkar lagane pad rahe hai
 Not only this, Arvind says that he also gave 100 rupees to the customer service point of the State Bank for opening the account, while the fixed amount to be taken in the name of the service by the bank for opening a zero balance account in the rural area is just 25 Is Rs
 
 
 to free account ke naam par janata ko chuunaa customer sarvice point par bhi lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Although Ramphal Sharma, who works at Khoda's State Bank Customer Service Point, denies this, but the public is saying that there is some black in the pulses
 in bank khaaton se zyada phayda unka bhi hone vaala tha, jo doordaraj se aakar dilli yaa ensiaar main kaam karte hai, or jinhen apane ghar paisa bhejnaa hota he
 Banks refuse to send money due to not having an account
 lihaaja aise logon ko mani transfar ke liye jagah-jagah khule eco-counter kaa aasraa hi bachataa he, jahaan kamishan sarkari bainkon se zyada he
 Kapil Dev Prasad, who sells slippers on the pavement, says that now he never goes to the bank to send money at home
 do-teen baar qatari main lage, jab kareeb ghante bhar baad number aata to bank account kii baat puuchhati
 If i had not answered, i would have refused to send money
 saath-saath 55 saal ke kapil yah bhi kahana nahin bhoolatey ki pradhanmantri ne ham jaison ke liye acchhee yojana shuru kii
 Had our account opened easily, we would have saved some money too
 iske baad hamane aise hi ek eco-counter kaa rukh kiya
 The attempt was to find out who would take advantage of such a facility
 najar daudai to khodaa colony ke state bank ke saamne tabarak communication dikhaa - bade-bade aksharon main likhaa tha ki yahaan se har jagah or har bank main paisa transfar karen
 Dheeraj of Tabarak Communication said that people who do not have accounts in Delhi or NCR come here
 agar jan-dhan yojana ke tahat sabake account khul jaaen to dhandhe par bhi asar padegaa or phir hamaari dukaan bhi band ho sakati he
 Dheeraj says that the charge of sending Rs 10,000 from us is Rs 100
 vahiin esbiai kahati he ki hamaare yahaan itani hi rakam 50 rupee shulk par bheji ja sakati he
 In such a situation, if people have their own accounts, then there will not be much flour in poverty for transferring money to remote areas
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki jan-dhan yojana saraahneey he or hamaari koshish aalochana se kahin zyada hakeekat bataane or dikhaane kii he, lekin jab makasad puraa na ho rahaa ho or logon kii bechaargi ab bhi barkaraar ho to jarurat nae sire se chintan-manthan kii he
 Otherwise, there is a fear that this scheme may also remain as government

 narendra modi ko bijepi ne jyon hi chunaav abhiyaan kii kaman saunpi, siyasat main halchal much gai
 The JDU, which has been supporting for a long time, kept away from the BJP
 shivasena jaisi kai anya puraani sahyogi partiyaan apni ranneeti par phir se vichaar kar rahi hai
 Overall, the BJP once again seems to be an untouchable for other parties
 isi siyaasi ganit par aadhaarit padhie ye story
 
 
 Fell from the sky, stuck in the date palm
 narendra modi ke bijepi chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa adhyaksh banate hi endie ke majboot sahyogi jedy (you) kaa khisakna bijepi kii modimay udaan ko jhatka de chukaa he
 The party has once again reached the '90s era, where it was considered untouchable
 arthvyavastha, vikaas, bhrashtachar ke mudde par hindutv haaavee hone laga he

 Sangma's National People's Party is preparing a strategy for a pre-poll alliance to eradicate the 'political untouchable' tag
 lekin modi ko kareeb-kareeb pradhanmantri ummidavaar maan chuki bijepi ke liye mushkil shivasena ne bhi khadi kar di he
 Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray maintained constant suspense in Modi's name during his recent visit to Delhi
 aise main bidak rahe sahyogiyon ko rokna or nayon ko jodpha modi kii raah ko kathin bana rahaa he
 Difficult for Modi is not just now, it will be hard for him to increase the scope of the alliance after the elections
 chunaav baad kii sthiti main bijepi kii najar jin dalon par he, unamem tamilnadu se annadramuk, andhra pradesh se tiares or jaganmohan reddy kii viesar congress, orissa se bijedy shaamil hai
 If the estimated seats (75-80) of these parties are combined with the current NDA allies Shiv Sena and Akali Dal, then BJP will have to get 190-200 seats on its own to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister
 lekin agar congress ne telugana rajya banane kaa vaada puraa kar diya to tiares shaayad hi endie kaa rukh kare
 However, a BJP camp is confident about Jaganmohan caught in the CBI clutches, while the BJD may object to Modi
 lekin in dalon ko lekar bijepi kii ranneeti sire chadh bhi jaae to sawaal he ki jab bijepi ram mandir jaise andolan ke charam par bhi 200 siten nahin jeet saki, to ab kaise sambhav he? nishchit rup se laalkrishna adwani us sthiti main nirnaayak bhoomika adaa karenge
 However, a senior BJP general secretary says, "we will not need anyone's support
" is baar ham vyakti nahin, vichaardhaara kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 But there is a difference between claims and reality
 bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye jedy (you) or tiemasi main se ek yaa donon kaa samarthan hasil karnaa hoga
 By the way, Nitish will not mind Advani
 jabaki modi kii vajah se jedy (you) ne bijepi se 17 saal purana rishta tod liya to pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or tiemasi supremeo mamata banerjee ne 19 july ko do-took elaan kar diya, ''ham narendra modi ko samarthan nahin karte or tiemasi bhavishya main bhi kabhi unhen samarthan nahin degi

 Walking and playing in the open field also stopped
 is kaaran dhoop ke jariye milane vaala vitamin-di un tak nahin pahunch paata
 Whenever someone has pain in the knee or joint, they feel that there is a deficiency of calcium, whereas vitamin-d goes unnoticed

 Vaishya says that arthritis can be prevented from progressing if calcium and vitamin d are also tested on time

 According to Raju Vaishya, apart from arthritis, osteoporosis is also very likely due to wrong eating habits and calcium deficiency in childhood
 osteoporosis main calcium kii kami ke kaaran haddiyon kaa ghanatv evam asthi majja bahut kam ho jaataa he
 Also, the texture of bones also deteriorates, due to which the bones become very brittle and very sensitive
 is kaaran haddiyon par halkaa dabaav padane yaa halki chot lagane par bhi ve tut jaati hai

 uttar pradesh board parikshaayen shuru ho gai hai or is baar nakal par roak lagane ke liye kai kadam uthaae gaye hai
 Last year, more than 10 lakh candidates had left the exam due to the curbing of cheating, and after this year, around 9 lakh fewer candidates have registered
 sarkaar bhi nakal viheen pariksha ke liye software se lekar police tak kii madad le rahi he
 After the Bharatiya Janata Party government came to power in the state, copying has also been controlled
 aisa pehali baar nahin he ki bijepi ke sarkaar main rahete hue nakal par lagaai ho, isse pehle kalyaan singh or rajnath singh kii sarkaar main bhi rigelt kaaphi kam rahaa tha or unhen pradesh kii kadi parikshaon main se ek mana gaya tha
 In fact, in the year 1992, the Kalyan Singh government controlled the copycat and the result was reduced to 30 percent
 bataaya jaataa he ki us vakt yah nakalchiyon ko pakadakar sidhaa jail bheja rahaa tha
 However, a year before that in 1991, in Mulayam Singh Yadav's government, this result was more than 80 percent
 uske baad phir mulaayam singh sarkaar main dhire-dhire paas hone vaale ummidavaaron kii sankhya main ijapha ho gaya
 After that, in 1998 and 1997, under Kalyan Singh's rule, the result was less than other governments and only 55 per cent children passed the examination
 vahiin 2002 main rajnath singh kii sarkaar main bhi 70 fisadi rigelt rahaa, jo aage kaaphi badha
 After that the result figures in the Samajwadi government had also touched 90 percent
 haalanki bijepi netaa ram prakaash gupta kii sarkaar main rigelt pratishat main thodaa ijapha hua
 During that time, it was said that Mulayam Singh Yadav is soft in taking action on imitators
 phir kai saal baad 2017 main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar bani or bijepi ne hameshaa kii tarah nakalchiyon par lagaam lagaana shuru kar diya
 Its effect was also visible and due to this, about 10 lakh candidates left the exam in the middle
 is saal bhi kam logon ne pariksha main register kiya he
 The government has taken several important steps to stop cheating and according to the latest reports, fewer children are reaching the examination centers
 haalanki pichhali baar pariksha kaa rigelt 70-72 fisadi tak rahaa tha
 This time too, students are afraid that there may be a decrease in the number of candidates to pass

 The budget session of Parliament will begin in the first week of February
 sutron ne is baat ko saajha karne se manaa kar diya ki sijeai ne kitne vetan vruddhi kii maang kii he lekin unhone kaha ki vetan vruddhi ko amali jama pehanaane ke liye adhinium main sanshodhan kiya janaa he
 The winter session of Parliament is scheduled to end on Friday
 unhone kaha ki ab vidheyak ko bajet satr main pesh kiya jayega
 The comments ucchtam nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish ko philhal vetan or bhatte se katautee ke baad haath main pratimah dedh lakh rupee milte hai
 The CJI gets more than this while the High Court judges get less
 is raashi main kiraaya mukt awaas shaamil nahin he, jo nyaayadhishon ko seva main rahane ke dauraan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 The matter is already under consideration of the government following the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
