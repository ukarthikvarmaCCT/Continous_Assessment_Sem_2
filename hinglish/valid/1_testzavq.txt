 The following different theories have been formulated on the causes of earthquakes: pratyasth pratikshep siddhant - san 1906 main harry fielding read ne is siddhant ko pratipaadit kiya tha
 This theory came to light after a thorough study and survey of the San Francisco earthquake
 is siddhant ke anusaar bhuparpati par neeche se koi bal lambii avadhi tak kaary kare, to vah ek nishchat samay tathaa bindu tak us bal ko sahegi or uske pashchaat chattaanon main vikruti utpann ho jaaegi
 If the force continues to work even after the deformation occurs, the rocks will break
 is prakaar bukamp ke pehle bukamp gati banaanevaalish urja chattaanon main pratyasth vikruti urja ke rup main sanchit hoti rahati he
 At the time of breakage the rocks are a reflection of the state of degeneration on both sides of the fault
 pratyasth urja bukampatarangon ke rup main mukt hoti he
 The Elastic Reversion Theory only explains the above mentioned cause of earthquake, which is also supported from the point of view of geology
 prithvi ke sheethal hone kaa siddhant - bukamp ke kaarnon main ek atyant pracheen vichaar prithvi kaa thandha hona bhi he
 There is no difference in the temperature inside the earth even after the crust is solid

 samasthiti siddhant -iske anusaar bhootal ke parvat evam sagar dharaatal ek duusare ko tula kii bhanti santulan main rakhe hue hai
 When soil of high place gets deposited at the bottom due to corrosion etc
, then the balance gets deteriorated and to keep the balance again, the deposited part gets stuck down and it causes earthquake
 mahadwipiya visthaapan pravaah siddhant -- -abhi tak anekon bhuvigyaniyon ne mahadwipiya visthaapan par apane apane mat pratipaadit kiye hai
 According to them, all the continents were formerly a body, which broke back and gradually broke away from displacement and came to the present day
 
 While some problems are highlighted in this hypothesis, in the absence of sufficient amount of force required for displacement, this hypothesis also becomes insignificant
 iske anusaar jab mahadwipon kaa visthaapan hota he tab pahaad upar uthte hai or uske saath hi bhransh tathaa bukamp hote hai
 Radioactivity Theory - In 1925 Jolly developed a theory regarding the earthquake caused by the cyclic effect of radioactive heat, which collects inside the mantle of continents
 iske anusaar radioactive ooshmaa jab mukt hoti he tab mahadwipon ke andar kii chizon ko pighla detii he or yah drav chote se bal ke kaary karne par bhi sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he, yadhyapi is siddhant kii kaarividhi kuch vicitra si lagati he

 yadrichhik-abhigam smriti dwaara jaani jaati he), computer data sangrahan kaa ek rup he
 Today it takes the form of integrated circuits that allow stored data to be accessed in any order, ie, random)
 shabd yadrichhik is prakaar is tathy ko sanderbhit karata he ki data kaa koi bhi hissaa apni bhautik sthiti or chaahe yah data ke pichley hisse se sambandhit ho yaa na ho, in sabaki parvaah kiye bagaiyr nirdhaarit samay main waapas aa saktaa he
 This system works with the frequency of bus, then it is called SDRAM, which is most commonly used in computers nowadays
 isaki In contrast, storage devices such as magnetic disks and optical disks depend on the physical speed of the recording medium or the readable end
 in upkarnon main, gati main data sthanantaran se adhik samay lagata he or agali vishay-vastu kii bhautik sthiti ke aadhaar par punarprapti samay badalata rahata he
 The term RAM is often related to volatile or volatile type memory memory modules) where information is lost when power is stopped operating
 adhiktar rome or nor-flash kahe jane vaale ek prakaar ke flash memory sahit kai anya prakaar kii memory ram bhi he
 There are two types of RAM
 static RAM aur daynemic RAM hoti he
 An early type of massively writeable random-access memory was magnetic core memory developed from the years 1949 to 1952 and later most computers until the development of static and dynamic integrated RAM circuits in the late 1960s and early 1970s
 It was used in isse pehle, "mukhya" memory prakaaryon ko karyanvit karne ke liye computaron main riley, vilamb line memory yaa vibhinn prakaar kii vaikum tub vyavasthaaon kaa istemaal hota tha jinamein se kuch yadrichhik abhigam hote the or kuch nahin
 vaikum tub tryod se or baad main asatat transister se nirmit kundiyon ko apekshaakrit chote or tej memory jaise yadrichhik-abhigam register bainkon or registeron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Prior to the development of integrated ROM circuits, permanent random-access memory was often constructed using semiconductor diode matrices driven by address decoders
 aadhunik prakaar ke riteble ram aam taur par data kaa ek bit yaa to flip-flop avasthaa main jaise esaram, yaa kisi sandharitra main aavesh ke rup main jaise diram, ipirome, iipirome or flash main sangrahit karte hai
 Some types have circuitry to detect and / or repair random faults called memory errors in stored data using parity bits or error correction codes
 read-only prakaar ke ram, rome, aavesh kaa bhandaaran karne ke bajaay chaynit transistaron ko sthaayee rup se sakriy / niskriy karne ke liye dhaatu ke ek mask kaa prayog karata he
 Since both ASRAM and DIRAM are unstable, other forms of computer storage, such as disks and magnetic tapes, are used as permanent storage in traditional computers
 kai nae utpaada data ke rakrakhaav ke liye iske bajaay flash memory par nirbhar rahete hai jab unka upyog nahin hota he jaise pidie yaa laghu sangeet vadak
 kuch vyaktigat computaron, jaise kai tej computaron or netbukon ne chumbakeey discon ko bhi flash drivon ke saath badal diya he
 With flash memory, only the nor type is capable of true random access, allowing direct code execution and is therefore often used instead of ROM; The low-cost NAND type is typically used for bulk storage in memory cards and solid-state drives
 microprocesar kii tarah, memory chip bhi lakhon transistaron or sandharitron se milakar bana ek ekikrut paripath ) hota he
 The most common form of computer memory, dynamic random access memory), combines a transistor and a capacitor to form a memory cell that represents only one bit of data
 sandharitra main soochna kii ek bit hoti he — ek 0 yaa ek 1
 transister ek switch kii tarah kaam karata he jo memory chip kii niyantran circuitary ko sandharitra ko padhane yaa uski avasthaa main parivartan karne kii anumati pradaan karata he
 Many computer systems have a memory hierarchy that includes CPU registers, on-die asraum cache, external cache, dieram, paging system, and virtual memory or swap space of a hard drive
 memory ke is samgr pool ko kai developaron dwaara "ram" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he, yahaan tak ki vibhinn upatantron main ram main yadrichhik abhigam sangya se pare mul avadharana kaa ulanghan karte hue bilkul alag-alag abhigam samay ho saktaa he
 Even under a hierarchy level such as DIRAM, special rows, columns, banks, ranks, channels, or intergroup associations of components make the access time variable, although not to the extent that the recurring storage medium or tape becomes variable
 The overall goal of using the memory hierarchy is to achieve the maximum possible average access performance while reducing the total cost of the entire memory system, following the registers and access times with slower hard drives below)
 kai aadhunik vyaktigat computaron main, ram, modul ke ek sahaj unnat rup main aati he, jinhen memory modul yaa diram modul kehete hai or jinka aakaar lagbhag chuing gam ke tukdon ke samaan hota he
 These can be replaced immediately when they are damaged or when more storage capacity is required due to changing requirements
 jaisaa ki upar suzav diya gaya he, kam maatra vaali ram ) ko hard-drivon, sidi-rome or computer tantra ke kai duusare hisson ke saath-saath sipiu or madraboard ke anya isi main bhi ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Many CPU architectures and operating systems are capable of performing a task known as "swapping" if a computer slows down on RAM during a rapid application cycle
 gamagaman ek prishthan fil kaa upyog karata he jo asthaayee rup se atirikt kaaryakari memory ke rup main prayukt hard drive kaa ek kshetra he
 Continuous use of this mechanism is called thrashing and is generally undesirable because it slows down the overall performance of the system, mainly because hard drives are much slower than RAM
 read-rhite kii kshamta rakhane vaale anya bhautik upkarnon ke naam main "ram" kaa prayog ho saktaa he: udhaaharan ke taur par, dividi-ram 
ek anukraman vidhi kaa naam bhi "yadrichhik abhigam" he: isiilie discs bhandaaran ko aksar "yadrichhik abhigam" # fil or input / output, platform, maanak sanskaran # yadrichhik abhigam]], anukramit fil) kaha jaataa he kyonki pathan sira, data ke ek bhaag se duusare bhaag main apekshaakrit turant gati kar saktaa he or iske bich ke sabhi data ko padhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 However, the final "M" is important: "RAM") always refers to solid-state equipment
 ram praayah computer kii mukhya kaaryakari memory ke sandarbh main online baatcheet kaa ek ashulipi yaa sankshep lekh he
 Software can "partition" a portion of a computer's RAM and allow it to act as a faster hard drive called a RAM disk
 yadi prayukt memory non-volatile na ho, to computer ko band karne par ram discs main sangrahit data kho jaataa he
 However, volatile memory can keep its data intact when the computer shuts down if it has a separate power-source, usually a battery
 kabhi-kabhi, apekshaakrit kam abhigam samay kii suvidha praapt karne ke liye rome kii samagriyon ko esaram yaa diram main pratilipit kar diya jaataa he dhimi ho sakati he)
 uske baad rome chip ko niskriy kar diya jaataa he jab inishilised memory sthanon ko badalakar pate ke usee khand main sthapit kar diya jaataa he
 This process is commonly used in both computer and embedded systems, sometimes called shadowing
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ke taur par, vishisht vyaktigat computer ke bios main praayah "shadow bios kaa prayog karen" kahalaane vaala ek vikalp yaa usee tarah kaa koi vikalp hota he
 Once activated, the functions based on the data of the BIOS ROM will use the DRAM locations instead
 Depending on the sister, this may or may not result in increased performance
 kuch tantron main laabh kaalpanik ho saktaa he kyonki pratyaksh hardware abhigam ke paksh main booting karne ke baad bios kaa upyog nahin hota he
 Of course, some less free memory is available when shadowing is active
 kai nae-nae prakaar ke non-volatile ram vikasadhin he jo vidyut aapurti ke band ho jane par bhi data ko surakshit rakhenge
 chumbakeey surang prabhaav kaa upyog karke carbon nanotub or drushtikon yukt praudyogikiyon kaa prayog hua
 In the first-generation MIRAM, a 128-kilobyte magnetic RAM) chip was manufactured in the summer of 2003 with 0
18 μm of technology
 june 2004 main, ]] ne phir 0
18 μm praudyogiki par aadhaarit ek 16 mabibite prototip kaa udghaatan kiya
 Two second generation technologies are currently under development: Thermal Assisted Switching) which is being developed by]] and spin torque transfer) on which]],]], IBM and several other companies are working
 ]] ne san 2004 main ek kriyasheel carbon nanotub memory prototip 10 ) saarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 Whether or not some of these technologies will eventually gain a significant share of the market either from DRAAM, ASRAM or from flash-memory technology remains to be seen, however
 san 2006 ke baad se, "thos avasthaa vaale drive" uplabdh ho gaye hai jinaki kshamta 64 gigabite se adhik or kaary-nishpaadan paaramparik discon se kahin adhik he
 This development has begun to blur the definition between traditional random access memory and "disk" and has narrowed their performance gap in particular
 plastic chumbakon ke kshetra main bhi sakriy anusandhan hua he jo prakaash par aadhaarit chumbakeey vipareetata main pher-badal karte hai
 Some types of random access memory such as "ecorem" have been specifically designed for server farms where low power consumption is more important than speed
 "memory kii diwaar", sipiu or sipiu chip ke baahar sthit memory ke bich kii gati kii bad rahi vipareetata he
 One of the main reasons for this contrast is the limited communication bandwidth outside the chip boundaries
 varsh 1986 se 2000 tak, sipiu kii gati main 55% kii vaarshik dar se sudhaar hua jabaki memory kii gati main keval 10% kaa hi sudhaar hua
 Given these trends, it was expected that memory latency would become a major hindrance in computer performance
 vartmaan main, kuch had tak pramukh bhautik baadhaon ke kaaran or kuch had tak vartmaan sipiu dizin dwaara kuch arthon main pehle se hi memory kii diwaar ko prabhavit karne ke kaaran sipiu kii gati ke sudhaar main kaaphi kami ai he
 Intel has briefly revealed these reasons in its Platform 2015 documentation)
 "sabase pehle, chunki chip kii jyamiti simat gai he or clock kii aavritiyon main vruddhi hui he isliye maujuuda transister ke risaav main vruddhi hui he jiske parinamswaroop bijli kii khapat or garmi main tezi aa jaati he
 

 Secondly, the advantages of faster clock speeds are somewhat negated by memory latency because memory access time has not been able to keep pace with the clock's increasing frequencies
 teesri baat yah he ki kuch anuprayogon ke liye paaramparik dharawahik architekchar kam sakasham hote ja rahe hai jabaki procesar main tezi aa rahi he or iske saath-saath yah laabh ko bhi kam kar de rahe hai taaki aavriti vruddhi ko kisi duusare tareeke se karidaa ja sake
 iske atirikt, kuch had tak thosavastha vaale upkarnon ke tahat prerakta ke utpaadan ke sadhano main seemabaddhata ke kaaran, sanket sancharan main pratirodh-dharita ) kii vilambtaa main vruddhi ho rahi he kyonki suvidha ke aakaar chote ho gaye he jo ek atirikt aadchan daal rahaa he jisase aavriti kii vruddhi kaa pataa nahin chalata he
 " sanket sancharan main aarasi kii vilambtaa ko clock dar banaam ipisi : paaramparik microarchitekchar ke maarg kaa ant main bhi darj kiya gaya he jo san 2000 or san 2014 ke bich vaarshik sipiu kaary-nishpaadan sudhaar main adhik-se-adhik ausatan 12
5% kaa anumaan prastut karata he
 Data from Intel processors clearly shows that recently the performance improvement of the processor has decreased
 baharhaal, pichley ]] processron kii tulana main intel ke nae processron, ]] main kaaphi sudhaar dikhaai diya he; adhik sakasham architekchar ke kaaran kaary-nishpaadan main vruddhi hui he jabaki clock dar main giravat ai he
 Unlike ordinary models, modern SDRAM materials are not immediately lost when the computer is turned off; Rather, the material disappears, a process that takes only a few seconds at room temperature but which can be increased to minutes at a lower temperature
 yahi vajah he ki kisi bhi sangrahit data ko saadhaaran kaaryakari memory modul) main punah praapt karnaa sambhav he
 This is sometimes referred to as a cold boot attack aka ice-man attack
