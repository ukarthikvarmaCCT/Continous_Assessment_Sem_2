 Even though Porus was defeated in the war, as some historians believe, this war did not give Alexander's army the courage to move forward
 After Porus, to win India now, many rulers had to fight, so Alexander's army refused to move forward
 Greek historians hid this fact and created the theory of army exhaustion
 In the event that he could not move forward, he returned

 shakuni yaa shakuni gandhar samrajya kaa raja tha
 This place is in present-day Afghanistan
 vah hastinapur maharaj or kauravon ke pita dhritarashtra kaa saalaa tha or kauravon kaa mamaa
 Shakuni is believed to be the hand behind Duryodhana's devious policies and he is considered to be the chief among the culprits for the battle of Kurukshetra
 usne kai baar pandavon ke saath chal kiya or apane bhaanje duryodhana ko pandavon ke prati kutil chaalen chalane ke liye uksaaya
 Uluka was the son of Shakuni and Arshi

 Shakuni's sister Gandhari was married to Dhritarashtra
 shakuni kii kuruvansh ke prati ghrinaa kaa kaaran yah tha, kii hastinapur ke senapati bhishma ek baar dhritarashtra ke liye gandhari kaa haath maangane gandhar gaye
 Then Gandhari's father Subal accepted this, but at that time he did not know that Dhritarashtra is a birthright
 iskaa shakuni ne bhi virodh kiya, lekin gandhari ab tak dhritarashtra ko apana pati maan chuki thi
 That's why Shakuni took a vow that day that it would cause the entire Kuru dynasty's apocalypse

 He was seeing the grandeur of the palace, that at one place he considered the water-floor decoration as solid ground and fell into the water
 ise duryodhana ne apana apmaan samajha or vah hastinapur laut aayaa
 Sensing this mental state of his nephew, Shakuni had a devious idea in his mind to snatch the Pandavas' coronation
 usne pandavon ko chausar ke khel ke liye aamantrit kiya or apni kutil buddhi ke prayog se yudhisthir ko pehle to chote-chote daav lagane ke liye kaha
 When Yudhishthira made up his mind to leave the game, someone would claim Yudhishthira by saying something or something by Shakuni

 mahatvapurn sanket Kalil or colloid is a chemical mixture in which one object is uniformly dispersed in another
 parikshepit vastu ke kan mishran me keval nilambit rahete he naa ki ek vilyan kii tarah 
 This is because the size of the particles in the particle is larger than the size of the particles present in the solution - these particles are so small that they are completely dispersed in the mixture to form a homogenous mixture, but not so large that light Scour and do not dissolve
 is parikshepan ke chalate kuch kalil vilyan jaise dikhte hai
 a bud system has two distinct phases: the first dispersion phase and the second continuous phase
 ek kalil pranali thos, drav yaa gasiy ho sakati he
 The table below gives a comparative analysis of the diameter of the particles of the plume in a homogenous and uniform mixture
 : Therefore, the collicular suspensions are intermediates for homogenous and homogeneous mixtures
 kalil ke liye angreji main kollid shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The word is derived from the Greek word kola which means 'glue'
 san 1861 i
 main ek angrej vaigyanik, tamas graham, ne dekha ki albumin, sares, gond, maand, silisik amla or isi prakaar ke anya padaarth jal main ghole jane par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se chhanakar nahin nikal pate
 In contrast, hydrolysis of sugars, urea, sodium, chloride, etc
 are released from the pores of the bio-membrane
 purv prakaar ke padaarth adhikansh main acristalia rup main milte hai is gun ke aadhaar par jal main viley padaartho kaa do virgon main vibhaajan kiya gaya: ek ve padaarth, jo crystalia the or jal main vilyan ke pashchaat jaev jhilli ke chhidron se bahirgat ho sakate the, crystalloid kehalaae or duusare ve, jo acristalia the or jal main gholne par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikalne main samarth nahin ho sakate the, kalil kehalaae
 But now it has been proved that crystalline substances like sugars and sodium chloride can also be obtained in the appropriate medium in the form of pigments
 kalilavastha main kalil kan ek avichhinn madhyam main bikhare rahete hai
 Thus, there are two components in the buds
 neeche kii suchi main pehla naam madhyam kaa or doosraa naam vitarit padaarth kaa he : The size of the calculus is particularly important
 aakaar main kalilkan anuon se bade hote hai, kintu aise sabhi kanon se, jo sookshmdarshi se dekhe ja sakate hai, ye aakaar main chote rahete hai
 They extend 10–5 cm
 From 10–7 cm Happens till
 yadhyapi upar di gai suchi ke prayek mail ke kalil praapt kiye ja sakate hai, phir bhi or prakaar ke kalil adhik prayukt hote hai or inhen kaa adhyayan bhi adhik vistaarpurvak kiya gaya he
 The solids of the solid or liquid distributed in the medium of water are called Sauls
 carbonic or acarbonic donon prakaar ke padaarth anek roopon main kalilavastha main paae jate hai
 Scientifically or technically, there is hardly any branch in which the buds are not used significantly
 apni isimhatta ke kaaran kalil vigyaan vishesh rup se hota gaya he
 In order to distinguish between the qualities of the Kalils, they have been divided into two major classes
 pehle varg main dhatviya prakaar ke kalil, jaise swarna kalil aadi, hai or duusare varg main protein prakaar ke kalil hai, jaise gelatin aadi
 Their special qualities are as follows: in donon prakaar ke kalilon ke liye jin shabdon kaa vishesh prayog hota he ve hai jalasantrasi or jalpremi 
 They are also called lyophobic and lyophilic in English in order
 yah vargeekaran purnroopen santoshjanak nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki katipay kalilon ke kuch gun donon charam virgon ke apokshakrit gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 These types of waterways have some metal oxides or hydroxides, some insoluble phosphate, molybdate, tungstate etc
 kuch log kalilon ko alambaabh or pysabh ke do virgon main vibhajit karte hai
 Apart from these, there is also a third category of Kalils which has become particularly important now
 yah varg kalileey vidyudvishleshya kehalaata he
 Soap water is a typical example of this
 in jalakalilon main vidyucchalakata bhi hoti he
 They are now being used more as refinements
 kalilon main atisookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se browneey gati ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Mergers do not have this action
 jab ek twri kiranpath kendrit karke jalakalil ke madhya se bheji jaati he tab kiranpath dugdhabh ho jaataa he or bahirgat kirane dhravatv praapt kar leti hai
 The reason for this is the similarity in the size and wavelength of light and the uniformity in the wavelength of the distributed matter and the wavelength of the light and the alternation of the opposing material is greater than the mean of the different medium
 shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se tindal ke prabhaav dwaara kalilkanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 When viewed in this way, the calculus appears like the illuminated stars
 saath hi inaki gati twri, aniyamit or nirantar hoti he
 This motion is called Brownian motion
 isi gati se padaartho ke gatyaatmakataa-siddhant ke vichaaron kii praayogic pushti hui he
 By extracting the Avogadro constant according to this theory, it has been proved that the values of the Avogadro-constant derived from this method by considering the experimental error are comparable to the values of the constant extracted from other methods

 anek pravidhik vidhiyon ke liye kalil nirmit karnaa aavashyak he
 Hydrographic plains can only be made easily, because watertight plots are reversible
 jalasantrasi kalilon ke nirmaan ke liye kai vidhiyaan prayukt hoti hai
 These methods can be divided into two classes - integration and disintegration
 pehali vidhi main aanaviya aakaar ke kanon ko dhire-dhire tab tak badhaayaa jaataa he jab tak ve kalilon kaa aakaar nahin praapt kar lete or unke adhik badhane kii gati kisi sthayitv pradaan karanevaale padaarth kii upasthiti se, athwa kisi jalpremi kalil ke mila dene se, niyantrit kar di jaati he
 By this method many metals, hydroxides, insoluble salts and silver halides used in photography have been made in the bud
 duusari vidhi se bade-bade kanon ko chote-chote kanon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In the braiding method metal pieces are obtained by breaking large pieces of metals with the help of electric arc
 is kaaran is vidhi ko vighatan kii vidhi kaha jaataa he, kintu vastav main ye kalil bhi ekikaran kii vidhi se hi banate hai
 The metal evaporates at high temperature of the arc
 phir vaashp ke ati sookshm kan ekikrut hokar kalilkanon kaa aakaar praapt kar lete hai
 In fact kalil-mill is the major means of making Kalil by partition
 is yantra main do platen, jo ek duusare ke atyant sameep rahati hai, paraspar vipareet disha main gumti he
 The material to be delivered is sent between these two plates with the appropriate medium
 is prakaar kan chote hokar kalil kanon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai
 For the treatment of the buds produced by any of the two methods, they are subjected to a different action by dialysis with a geminal substance
 aisa karne ke liye kalil ko parchament yaa celophen ke jhole main rakhaa jaataa he
 This bag is now kept in pure solvent
 yah vilaayak hi kalil kaa madhyam hota he
 Electrical dialysis can make refinement more complete and faster
 jalpremi kalil atyant sthaayee hote hai or vidyudvishleshya kii laghumatraaon ke prati niskriy hote hai
 Their stability is due to their solubility in the medium
 in kalilkanon kaa bahya tal madhyam ke anuon se dhakaa rahata he
 In this way the free energy of the outer plane is negligible
 isse ye kan aakaar main badhane main asamarth rahete hai
 In addition, it has been observed that water-soluble materials reduce the interstellar stress of the medium
 is prabhaav se bhi kalilon kaa sthayitv niyantrit rahata he
 The stability of the drainage systems is due to the charge located on the tubes
 kalilkanon ke bahya tal par aavesh kaa srijan unke dwaara avashoshit yanon ke kaaran hota he
 The charge at the bottom of the calculus decreases with the addition of an electrolyte, and gradually a situation arises when the bottom of the calculus at the lowest concentration of the electrolyte is unable to resist the forces of integration
 is prakaar vidyudvishleshya kaa vah nimnatam sandran, jo kisi kalil kii ek nishchit maatra ke avakshepan main samarth hota he, kalil kaa avakshepan maan kaha jaataa he
 In general, the higher the valence of the ion of the electrolyte, which is opposite to the charge of the alkaline, the stronger the precipitation power of the electrolyte
 jalasantrasi kalilon ko vidyudvishleshyon se surakshit rakhane ke liye unamem jalpremi kalil mila die jate hai
 This method is called conservation method
 swarnakalil ko gelatin kii sookshm maatra se avakshipt kiya ja saktaa he kintu is protein kii adhik maatra is kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karti he
 According to Jigmondi, the gold content of a black preservative is the number of milligrams of the preservative in the presence of 10 cubic centimeters of gold in the presence of 1 cubic cm of sodium chloride
 Can be precipitated by a solution whose concentration is 10 percent
 kalil kaa sangrakshan vishesh mahatv rakhata he or atyant pracheen samay se iskaa vyavhaar hota rahaa he
 It has already been said that there is charge on the black particles
 kalil par aavesh kaa prakaar gyaat karne ke liye saral avasorana prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Positive compounds are absorbed by silica jelly and negative compounds by aluminum hydroxide
 jalasantrasi kalil ke sthayitv ke liye aavesh kaa sthaan pramukh he
 The type of charge depends on the physical nature of the substance and on the electrodynamic that provides stability to the particle
 udaahranarth yadi rajat iodide ke saul ko len to usapar aavesh kaa prakaar dhanatmak yaa rinatmak donon hi ho saktaa he
 If there is a subtle excess of silver nitrate in Kalil, then Saul will be positive
 iske vipareet yadi potacium iodide kaa aadhiky hua to saul rinatmak ho jayega
 It has been observed that the charge of the silver iodide membrane becomes positive due to the presumptive adsorption of the positive silver ion, and the charge of this ion becomes negative due to the negative ion adsorption of the positive iodide
 kalileey tal par aavesh kii maatra or vibhav dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran dwaara parimapit kiye jate hai
 Saul is filled in a tube containing two platinum electrodes
 ab saul main disht vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaati he
 If the particles move towards the positive, there is a negative electric charge on them
 vidyut kshetra main kanon kii is prakaar kii gati dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran kehalaati he
 This speed can be conveniently measured by suitable optical methods
 veg ke maapan dwaara vidyudvibhav kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 This voltage is commonly called electrical-dynamic-voltage
 yah vidyutagtyatmk vibhav us samay bhi dekha jaataa he jab vidyudvishleshiya vilyan ko kisi sanrdhra tanupat se hokar bheja jaataa he
 Research has also been conducted on two other related verbs
 ye hai dharavibhav or avakshepan vibhav
 The electrical dynamic potential is different from the Nernst electrochemical potential
 ab siddh ho gaya he ki vaidyuthik rasinic vibhav vah vibhav he jo vitarit kala or vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The electrodynamic potential is the voltage that lies between the main volume of the distribution medium in the stationary part of the bicameral plane attached to that distributed art
 vitarit kala se sanlagn dwiktal kaa vaastavik swabhaav ab bhi kalpana kaa vishay he
 Nevertheless, it has been known that the electrodynamic-potential is particularly affected by the ions present
 gas ke niyam kalil vilyanon par thik baithte hai, iske paryaapt pramaan hai
 The curvature pressure of a Kalil can be calculated by the following equation: jahaan: Now, as the viscosity pressure is inversely proportional to the size of the particle, it makes it clear that the infusion pressure of the spiral should decrease and their volume should also increase with the distribution volume
