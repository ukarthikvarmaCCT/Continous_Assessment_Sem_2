 The solution is to end all welfare schemes and distribute the remaining amount directly to every voter through the Reserve Bank

 It is true that India is close to becoming a superpower but we are getting away from it due to corruption

 Not surprisingly, courts are the busiest and culprit bases of corruption of Indian society
 gandhiji ne kaha tha ki adaalat na ho to hindustan main nyaay garibon ko milane lage
 There is corruption in the judiciary, it is a common belief
 jab kisi vyakti ke khilaaf adalati nirnay aata he to use lagata he ki jarur nyaayadhish ne vipakshi logon se paise liye honge yaa kisi or vajah se usne adaalat kaa nirnay apane paksh main karvaa liya hoga
 Everyone says, but they are afraid not to get caught in a contempt case
 unke khilaaf karrwai ho sakati he
 Courts had become the bases of exploitation and corruption since the British era
 usee samay yah dharna ban gayi thi ki jo adaalat ke chakkar main padaa, vah barbaad ho jaataa he
 Corruption has become a common practice in the Indian judiciary
 sarvocch nyaayalay ke kai nyayadhishon par mahabhiyog kii kaarywahi ho chuki he
 Factors such as corruption in the judiciary - bribery, nepotism, extremely slow and very lengthy judicial process, very expensive court expenses, huge lack of courts and lack of transparency, corrupt conduct of employees etc
 aamtaur par kaha jaataa he ki falaan vakil ke paas jaaie, vah nishchit rup se aapaki jamaanat karvaa degaa
 That "definitely" has a meaning
 yahi bhrashtachar he
 But the courts have completely covered themselves in such a cover that no news is printed or action is ever taken on it
 kanoon aisa he ki aaj nyaayadhish ko giraftaar nahin kar sakate
 Except this, you cannot make a case against them for possessing disproportionate assets
 kanoon aisa he ki agar koi nyaayadhish is prakaar kii sthitiyon main paaya jaae to us par hone vaali karrwai ko saarvajanik nahin kiya jaataa
 By the way, if we look at the performance of the three organs of the state in the last seven decades, the judiciary itself will be considered better

 It is normal to take five years in court rulings, but not settling in twenty-thirty years is nothing short of a tragedy for the common people
 nyaay kaa moulik siddhant he ki vilamb kaa matlab nyaay ko nakaarna hota he
 When justice is being denied in crores of cases in the courts of the country, it will be like breaking the stars of the sky to get justice accessible to the common man

 According to a 2007 Transparency International report, about 2630 crore rupees were bribed in lower level courts
 ab to pashchim bengal ke nyaayamurti sen or karnataka ke dinkaran jaise maamle prakaash main aane se nyaaypalika kii dhaval chhavi par kaalikh ke chhinte pade hai
 One of the reasons for delay in disposal of cases is corruption
 ucchattam nyaayalay or hoicourt ke jajon ko hataane kii sanvidhanik prakriya itani jatil he ki karrwai kiya janaa bahut kathin hota he
 The issue of the formation of a judicial commission has been swinging in the government swing for years

 This is a shining example of India's proud judiciary, where the Supreme Court and its Chief Justice claim that the Right to Information Act is not applicable to them and the Delhi High Court dismisses the Petition by disagreeing with their opinion
 yah supreme court hi he, jisane andhrapradesh sarkaar dwaara musalamaanon ko shaikshanik sansthaaon main aarakshan par roak laga di
 Be it the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Law Minister of the country or others and one gets drowned in anxiety by seeing the number of pending cases, but no one seems to find a solution
 udhar, supreme court adaalaton main jajon kii kami kaa ronaa rota he
 According to him 1500 are required for the High Court and 23000 judges for the lower courts
 abhi kii sthiti yah he ki ucch nyaayalayon main hi 280 pad rikt pade hai
 Regarding the efficiency of the judges, the recently retired Chief Justice of Orissa High Court Bilai Naz said that many judges from the Magistrate Court to the Supreme Court are unsuccessful in dealing with criminal cases
 1998 ke faujadaari apilen bombai ucch nyaayalay main isliye vichaaradhin padi hai, kyonki koi jaj prakaran kaa adhyayan karne main dilchaspee nahin letaa
 As such, despite being given full facilities, public holidays are also the highest in the judiciary
 padon kii kami or rikt padon ko bhare jane main vilamb ansi samasyaayein hai, jinka niraakaran jaldi ho
 The fact is that the laxity and inefficiency of the judiciary also leads to crime and terrorism

 One of the world's fastest, most agile, brave and trusted forces in the country
 desh kaa samrik itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki bhartiya sena ne yudhon main wo wo ladai sirf apane jazbe or veerta ke kaaran jeet lee jo dushman bade aadhunik ast shastr se bhi nahin jeet paae
 But the way in the last few years, in large arms import export, a series of suspicious firearms in Ordnance Prisons, the movement of old vehicles, and how many such incidents, accidents and criminal acts have been written by the army and still remain Somewhere this trend is going on, he is pointing out that the situation is not the same now
 kahin kuch bahut hi gambhir chal rahaa he
 The saddest and most disturbing thing is that till now, most of the corruption and crime related to the army has been named after the high officials of the army
 aaj sena ke adhikariyon ko tamaam sukh suvidhaayen maujuud hone ke baavjood bhi, sena main bharti, aayudh, vardi evam rashan kii supplai tak main bady ghapale or ghotalebaji ke saboot, puraskaar or protsaahan ke liye farji muthbhedon kii saamne ai ghatnaayen aadi yahi bataa or darsha rahi hai ki bhartiya sena main bhi ab wo log ghus chuke hai jinhone vardi desh kii suraksha ke liye nahin pahani he
 Today there are many scams being done in the army in arms supply, military supplies, food ration supplies and fuel supply etc
 All the corrupt people associated with military and defense departments are supporting them in this

 If all the contracts and arms commercial deals are kept for the public, then the scope of hiding a lot will be lost
 media sakshartaa bhi dekhen Research on political corruption suggests that if the media is free and fair, it promotes good governance, which accelerates economic development
 bharat main 1955 main akhbaar ke maalikon ke bhrashtachar ke mudde sansad main uthte the
 Today, corruption in the media has increased to the extent that the owners of the media are seen sitting in Parliament in large numbers

 The pen of some editors stares at the pillars and masters of power
 2ji spectrum ghotaalaa maamla ne desh main bhrashtachar ko lekar ek nai ibaadat likh di
 In this whole case, where the political atmosphere was seen in the grip of corruption, the watchdog media of democracy was also implicated in the corruption of the king
 raja va media ke bhrashtachar ke khel ko media ne hi saamne laay
 However, this is not the first time that corruption in the media has been questioned
 Dabi, who considers the media as a mission, admits to Juban that the Niira Radia episode has exposed the high level of alleged corruption inside the media and exposed the media
 haalanki, aksar sawaal uthte rahe hai, lekin chote str par
 In small and big cities, districts and towns, the media is always accused of printing the news without taking any good monthly salary, or kicking brokerage in the name of the news
 khule aam kaha jaataa he ki patrakaron ko khilaao-pilaao-kuch thamaon or khabar chhapavaao
 In media seminars, media luminaries used to slurp on journalists who strangled, brokered media or raised money in the name of news loktantr par najar rakhane vaala media bhrashtachar ke jabade main he
 Even if the infiltration of corruption inside the media gets stirred up today, it is not a new thing

 Journalists working day and night in districts / towns are vulnerable, but not all

 At the same time, the biggest issue behind the corruption of journalists at a small level comes from economic exploitation
 chote or bade media houseon main 15 sau rupaye ke masik par patrakaron se 10 se 12 ghante kaam liya jaataa he
 Management's will from above, whenever the job is to be hired or fired

 The biggest reason is understandable, the economic reason of journalists, behind accepting the alleged corrupt media on a small scale, which can be called a degree of compulsion

 Due to this, even today, this class considers themselves different from ordinary Indians, above them, their rulers and masters
 apane adhikaron or suvidhaon ke liye yah varg jitna sachesht rahata he, aam janata ke hiton, jaruraton or apekshaaon ke prati utana hi udasin rahata he
 When India was a slave, Mahatma Gandhi had expressed the belief that after independence there would be his rule i
e
 self-rule, but seeing the situation today, he has to say that where is his rule? Where does the system of that public appear, which established its own system? Today there is a network of quadratic bureaucracy
 loktantr kii chaati par savaar yah afasarshahi hamaare sapanom ko chur-chur kar rahi he
 During the subjugation of the country, the main objective of this bureaucracy was to keep the British rule intact and strengthen it in India
 janata ke hit, uski jaruratein or uski apekshaayen dur-dur tak uske sarokaaron main nahin the
 At the top level of the bureaucracy were officers of the Indian Civil Service, mostly British officers

 The aim of the model of education formulated by Lord Macaulay was to strengthen the British rule in India and to prepare such Indian babus who could nurture the interests of Britain by exploiting their own countrymen

 India's top politicians decided to continue the colonial administrative model even after independence, due to an organized system of the most talented individuals with strict internal discipline and unquestioned mastery
 is baar anushaasan ke maandand ko naukarshahi kaa mul aadhaar banaaya gaya
 This is the reason that even though the name of the Indian Civil Service was changed to Indian Administrative Service in independent India and the administrative officers were called as public servants, but in their tricks, character and nature, that service remained as before

 If our politicians want to, the system can be repaired in five years, but the current situation is favorable for them, so they do not change
 pichley kuch varshon se bharat ek nae tarah ke bhrashtachar kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 This corruption has come in the form of big scams and scams that are associated with the corporate world
 yah vidambnaa he ki karporate jagat kaa bhrashtachar lokapal ke daayre se baahar he
 The country saw very well how the private sector was successful in sharing crores of billions of rupees with some people in governance in the allocation of 2G spectrum and coal mines

 Due to bureaucratic involvement in this nexus, poor system of judiciary and corruption, all this wealth of the country has been systematically looted and become billionaire-billionaire
 yah sach he ki aaj bhi aise bade gharaane hai jo jab chahen kisi bhi siem or piem ke yahaan jab chahen dastak den to daravaaje unke liye khul jate hai
 Adarsh society scam, 2G spectrum, Commonwealth scam and coal allocation scam in the country are examples of corporate scams

 swiss bank ke director ne yah bhi kaha he ki bharat kaa lagbhag 280 lakh karod rupee unke swiss bank main jamaa he
 This amount is so much that India's budget for the coming 30 years can be made without tax

 Or you can also say that a 4 lane road can be built from any village in India to Delhi

 This amount is so much that even if Rs 2000 is given to every Indian every month, it will not end for 60 years

 Just think

 'latin' kii shabdsuchiyon ne aadhunik kosh-rachana-paddati kaa jis prakaar vikaas kiya, angrej koshon ke vikaas kram main use dekha ja saktaa he
 Initially, the main legislation of these semantics was to convey the meaning of the words 'latin' in simple 'latin' language
 dhire-dhire suvidha ke liye roman bhoomi se duurastha pathak apni bhashaa main bhi un shabdon kaa arth likh dete the
 This new feeling also arose in the trend of English-speaking scholars of 'glassery' and 'vocabulari'
 is navchetana ke parinamswaroop 'latin' shabdon kaa angreji main arthnirdesh karne kii pravriti badhane lagi
 The initial form of the latin-english dictionary appeared in this sequence
 dasvin shatabdi main hi 'oxford' ke nikatavarti sthaan ke ek vidwaan dharmapeethadhish 'effric' ne 'latin' vyakaran kaa ek granth banaaya tha
 And added a 'latin-english', miniature of the words 'latin' classified with the same
 sambhavat: ukt dhang ke koshon main yah pratham tha
 Collecting lexicographic dictionaries from 1066 AD to 1400 AD, 'right Bueller' has introduced two such dictionaries

 They are merely a copy of earlier glossaries

 The first was 'vocabulariyam' of 'orats' which was based on the former 'meddala' grammar
 doosraa tha 'glafads' yaa 'jyaafaree' vyakaran par aadhaarit english—latin kosh
 The first printed edition was published by Pinsin in 1440 AD
 uskaa naam tha pronpatorium paravulorman sinachloricoran 
 Its importance was not because of the collection of 9–10 thousand words, because of this, a sign of new use was seen in the creation of the glossary
 isamen sangya or kriya ke mukhyansh se vyatirikt anya prakaar ke shabd bhi sankalit he
 This 'meddala Grammaties' was probably the first 'latin-english' dictionary
 lokapriyata kaa pramaan miltaa he— uski bahut si uplabdh pratilipiyo ke kaaran
 In 1483, a dictionary called 'vetholium Anglivan' was compiled
 parantu mahatvapurn kosh hokar bhi purvakt kosh ke samaan vah lokapriy na ho sakaa
 Subsequently, in the 16th century, several glossaries of 'latin-english' and 'english-latin' were produced and published
 'sar tamas eliyat' kii dictionari aisa sarvapratham granth he jisamen 'dictionari' abhidhaan kaa angreji main prayog miltaa he
 The root word is Latin's 'dictionarium' which means statement
 par vaiyakarnon dwaara 'kosh' shabd ke arth main uskaa prayog hone laga tha
 Before this, many names for popular dictionaries and dictionaries were popular, such as 'nominal', 'namebook', medulla grammatics, 'the artus vocabularium' Garden of Wadons, the Prompterium Porvorum, Catholics Aglican, Manuel's Vocabyurum, Handful Ava
 Vocabularies, 'the Abaccedarium, Biblothica, Albaria, Library, The Table Alphabetical, The Treasury or Treasurers of Words' The English Exposé And "the Guide to the Tngs, the Glasografia, The New Valders, required Wards' The Itimalaँjikm 'the Failaँlaँjikm' etc
 incychlopedia britnica ke anusaar 1224 een main kanthsth kii janevaali 'latin' shabdasuchi ke hastlekh ke liye jaan garlandia ne is shabd kaa sarvapratham prayog kiya gaya tha
 But why and how this word used by Sir Thomas Elliot became popular nearly three centuries later is not easy to say
 16veen shatee main purvardh ke vyateet hote hote yah vichaar swikrut hone laga ki shabdkosh main shabdaarth dekhne kii paddati suvidhapurna or saral honi chahie
 In this view, alphabetical arrangement for the dictionary was considered appropriate

 In Chinese language with monosyllabic and analytical designations, monolithic words are the only words

 The old dictionary there is based on the meaning and pronunciation-oriented method

 But in Europe's languages, Akaradi Kramanusari indicated a new direction towards lexicography

 It had a collection of proverbs and sayings on the ancient method
 mudrit koshon main iskaa apana sthaan tha
 In 1573, Richard Howlett's 'abesaderium' and 'john Wrait's Libraria' - two volumes were published
 pratham main latin paryaay ke saath saath angraji main arth kathan hone se angreji koshon main—visheshat: pracheen kaal ke—ise uttam or apane dhang kaa mahatvashaalee kosh mana gaya he
 Even earlier, in 1570, Peter Lewis created an English rhyming dictionary containing English words along with Latin words and all the specific words were rhyming

 Perhaps the most important of the immediate purpose in the construction requirements of the published lexicons up to 1660 was to support specific women and studious students

 bhashaa main prayukt samast saamaanya or vishisht shabdon kaa kosh banane main vidvan pravrutt nahin hue the
 'nathan Veli' first planned to construct a dictionary in which all English words were tried to be included

 It had many characteristics
 sankalit shabdon ke vikascram kaa sanket diya gaya tha
 At the same time, it has also been tried to give derivation

 In the second edition published in 1739, the pronunciation of words was also given
 angreji ke koshjna vidwaanon dwaara yah kosh atyant mahatvapurn angreji dictionari mana jaataa he
 The first reason was that it became the foundation of the English dictionary of historical importance created by Dr
 Johnson
 doosraa kaaran yah tha ki isamen samast angreji shabdon ke vayashakti sankalan kaa lakshya pehali baar rakhaa gaya
 The third reason was the attempt to introduce etymological instructions and the practice of pronouncing utterances
 ithli or fans academiciyanon dwaara aisale pramanik koshon kii rachana kaa kaarykram pravartit ho gaya tha jinamein parinishthit bhashaa ke manyataprapt prayogrupon kaa sthirikarnaur pramanikaran kiya ja sake
 Efforts were on to compose such a dictionary in German, Spanish, French and Italian languages
 angreji bhashaa kaa saahitiyik savaroop pusht, viksit, maanya evam viranishthit hota chal rahaa tha
 In addition to the poetry or versed language, the works of the Vacha were getting literary respect
 falat angreji bhashaa kaa tatkaaleen swaroop parinishthit bhashaa ke str par grahya or maanya ho gaya tha
 Hence, writers, book publishers and preachers began to realize that the creation of a well-defined English dictionary has become extremely important
 anek pustak prakashkon or vikritaon ke utsaah or sahyog se paryaapt dhanrashi vyay karke jaannsan dwaara anek barshon ke athak prayaas se angreji kii dictionari 1747 se 1755 i0 ke bich taiyaar kar prakashit kii gai

 As a result, inaccuracy of citations in many sites became an error of this dictionary

 was such a labor-time-impossible task that was completely impossible by a person in seven years

 William Kernick, William Parry, Thomas Sheridan and John Walker tried to solve the problem of pronunciation etc

 The task of describing the exact form of the pronunciation was problematic

 John Walker made a special effort in the above direction
 in kaarnon se 'jonson' ke kosh kii kuch aalochana bhi hoti rahi
 But by the first half of the 19th century, his honor increased, his importance was approved

 One such edition was published in 1898 which remains valid till now
 englistaniyon ke angreji prayogon se ameriganon kii angreji ko swatantra dekhakar webster ne america angreji kaa ek mahatvapurn kosh banaaya
 But many of the derivatives of his dictionary were not based on historical evidence but were invented by the independent imagination of his own

 Even today, the 'international' edition of Webster's Dictionary is published in two volumes and in some respects it remains important even today

 This meant that the British were squeezing the Indian economy by constantly imposing exports to their advantage and charging unnecessary surcharges
 ramesh chandra dutt kaa janm 1848 main kolkata ke ek aise parivaar main hua tha jisane east india company ke tahat vyapaar karke kaaphi sampatti arjeet kii thi

 In 1882, Ramesh Chandra Dutt continued to oversee administrative work in various districts of Bengal
 1883 main jila magistrate banane ke baad 1894 main bardhaman jile ke dipti kamishnar niyukt kiye gayi
 He was the first Indian to reach such a high position in the nineteenth century
 1897 main unhone isies se avkaash grahan kiya or 1904 tak kii avadhi europe main guzari
 He was also Professor of History at University College, London
 1899 main bhartiya rashtriya congress ke lakhanu adhiveshan ne unhen apana adhyaksh nirvaachit kiya
 From 1897 to 1904, he was Professor of Indian History at the University of London
 unka nidhan 1909 main hua
 Through his deep research and analysis, Dutt showed that the British rule not only failed to improve the physical condition of India, but also during its period India was de-industrialized
 british aarthik niti ke parinamswaroop bharat ke dastakaari utpaadan main jabardast giravat aayi or uski bharpai ke rup main audyogic utpaadan main badhotaree nahin hui
 Nor was Indian industry given any kind of protection
 nattejey ke taur par bhartiya arthvyavastha pehle se kahin zyaada kheti par nirbhar hone ke liye majaboor ho gayi
 Indian society continued to become rustic
 dutt kaa kahana tha ki british upniveshwaad ke kathith rachanaatmak kadamon se bhi bharat ko laabh nahin hua
 Due to rail transport started by the British, traditional transport services were killed and trains were used to carry goods made in British factories
 dutt kaa nishkarsh tha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha aviksit nahin he, balki uskaa vikaas avaruddh kar diya gaya he
 The history written by him defies the Marxist notion prevalent in a section of scholars according to which the role of British colonialism is seen to be progressive
 aarthik itihaaskaar ke alaava ramesh chandra dutt ek pratibhashali or kushal saanskrithik itihaaskaar bhi the
 Along with being the founder president of Bangi Sahitya Parishad, he also briefly wrote Mahabharata and Ramayana in English
 sanskrit sahitya ke pramaanon ke aadhaar par dutt ne bharat kii pracheen sabhyataa ke itihaas kii rachana bhi kii
 Apart from highlighting the ill effects of British economic policy, Dutt's second major contribution to the development of economic ideas was that he advocated setting limits to government intervention in the economy
 yah sifaarish unhone beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main ek aise samay main kii jab anya bhartiya arthshaastri aarthik jivan main sarkaar ke hastkshep ko kam karne kii maang kar rahe the
 Dutt said that the government should avoid private initiative interventions but should be prepared to intervene under specific circumstances so as to avoid conflict of interest by avoiding temporary types of crises
 yatharth kaa akalan karne kii dutt kii paddati bhi us jamaane ke hisaab se alag tarah kii thi
 Dutt developed the concept of interdependence of economic and political facts, instead of considering one as the major and the other as his influence among the many reasons of reality
 unki manyata thi ki samaaj ke tantra main har chiz ek-duusare par nirbhar he, paraspar judi hui he isliye santulan bigaadane jaisaa koi bhi kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 However, Dutt also understood that balance is not always the same
 vah lagaataar badalata rahata he
 Therefore, the government should focus on the underlying dynamics of the immediate situation while intervening, or else its interventionist actions may result in the opposite
 arthshaastra par dutt kii rachanaaon kaa prakaashan 1900 se shuru hua
 His first book was 'famines and Land Assessment in India', which studied the famines in India, which was also praised by Russian anarchist philosopher Prince Kropatkin
 unki is kriti se zaahir tha ki ve bhartiya kisaan kii jivan-sthitiyon main kitni dilchaspee rakhte hai or unka aarthik chintan kis tarah se uski sthiti sudhaarney par kendrit he
 Dutt questioned why the people of India had to face ten horrific famines in the span of forty years since 1858? He asked that during this time the ruler was in the hands of the Empress rather than the East India Company
 is dauraan aamtaur par shanti rahi or keval ek hi yuddh hua
 The government had trained administrators who had sufficient experience in Indian conditions
 zamin upjau thi, kisaan udhyami or kifaayatshar the
 Despite such favorable circumstances, why did it happen that during these famines, about 1
5 crore people lost their lives due to hunger? Dutt did not agree to believe that the cause of famines is due to the rapid increase in population or that the farmers of India are careless, unconcerned and cynical
 unhone yah bhi sweekaar nahin kiya ki kisaanon kaa soodakhor mahajanon ke shikanje main fasaa hona akaal kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Dutt showed in his study that the growth rate of population in India was not only always lower than in England, but in the ten years before his study, the population of this country had stopped increasing
 dutt ke anusaar bharat se zyaada parishramee or kam karch main guzar-basar karne vaale kisaan duniya main or kahin nahin hai
 He cited the reports of commissions investigating the causes of famine and said that it is due to the rigorous recovery of government revenue that farmers have to depend on the Mahajans
 angrez sarkaar ko aainaa dikhaate hue dutt ne pradarshit kiya ki akaal ke baavjood aisa koi saal nahin tha jab sari fasalen chaupat ho gayi hon
 Grain was always full in government warehouses
 ek praant main agar fasal karaab ho gayi ho, to duusare praant main fasal acchhee hui
 Farming has expanded, it has become denser, yields have also increased compared to earlier, prices of agricultural produce have also increased, but even after this the condition of farmers has continued to deteriorate
 iske liye dutt ne british nitiyon ko zimmedaar tehraaya
 In 1902, the first volume of Dutt's great treatise 'the Economic History of British India' was published
 ise british hukumat par likhe gayi sabase behtareen granth kii sangya di jaati he
 In this, economic history was introduced from the establishment of British power in 1757 till the emperor's rule was implemented
 isamen east india company ke tahat apanaayi gayi kheti or bhoomi bandobast sambandhi nitiyon, vyapaar or kaarkaanaa utpaadan sambandhi nitiyon ke saath-saath vitt or prashasan sambandhi nitiyon kaa vishleshnatmak vivaran tha
 British reviewers of the book also considered its impartiality and depth iron
 1904 main is mahagranth kaa doosraa khand prakashit hua
 He claimed on the basis of authentic facts that selfish policies adopted in the early years of British rule have been responsible for the decline of Indian industries
 dutt ne bharat main garibi ke kaarnon par prakaash daalate hue sabit kiya ki angrezon kii niti ke kaaran deshi udyog or hastkalaon ko tabah ho janaa padaa
 Millions of people became unemployed, leaving no other option but to live for them
 is tarah kheti ke bharose jivit rahane waalon kii sankhya had se zyaada bad gayi or sabhi ke rahan-sahan kaa str gir gaya
 Along with this, the British continued to spend huge money to rule India, which did not benefit the country
 rajkoshiya niti or bhu-rajasav pranali kuch is tarah kii banaayi gayi ki kisaan ke paas sirf zindaa bache rahane laayak sansaadhan hi rah gayi
 Dutt also had a prescription for curing these problems
 unhone sifaarish kii ki bhartiya mil udyog se utpaadan shulk hataa liya jaae, nichi daron ke naram lagaan ke alaava baaki sabhi taxon se kisaanon ko chhutkaaraa diya jaae, england main hone vaali faujee or shahi karch bharat se nahin vasule jane chahie or bharat main bhi faujee karch ghataaye jane chahie
 As soon as Dutt made these suggestions, the British government and its supporters started criticizing them all-round
 unke tathyon or vishleshan ko kaarij karne kii koshish kii gayi
 It should be noted that Dutt was a senior officer of Indian Civil Services and was bound by the responsibility of serving British rule
 lekin, apni baat par jame rah kar unhone apane virodhiyon ke saath bahes kii or sarkaar se lagaataar anurodh kiya ki vah bharat kii aarthik dasha main sudhaar ke liye nitiyaan badale
 His unique talent was not limited only to administrative work, but he was also an original writer and historian

 An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to devices participating in a computer network using the Internet Protocol for communication between its nodes
 ek IP adress do pramukh kaary karata he: mejabaan yaa network interfes pahchaan or sthaan parichayan
 isaki bhoomika kaa charitrachitran is prakaar he: "ek naam ingit karata he ki ham kya maangate hai
 An address indicates where he is
 ek maarg ingit karata he ki vahaan tak kaise pahunchen
" The designer of TCP / IP defined the IP address as a 32-bit number, and the system, known as Internet Protocol version 4 or ipv4, is still in use today
 baharhaal, internet ke vyapak vikaas or iske parinamswaroop uplabdh paton kii kami ke kaaran, 1995 main adress ke liye 128 bit upyog kar ke ek nayaa parichayan system, viksit kiya gaya or pichhali baar 1998 main RFC 2460 dwaara manakikrut kiya gaya
 Although IP addresses are stored as binary numbers, they are usually displayed in human-textual markers such as 208

 As the development of private networks raised the threat of ipv4 address termination, RFC 1918 set out a set of private address spaces that could be used by anyone on a private network
 vah vaishvik saarvajanik internet se judane ke liye, aksar network adress anuvadak ke saath upyog kiye jate hai
 The Internet Assigned Number Authority, which manages universal IP address space allocation, supports five regional Internet registries to allocate IP blocks to local Internet registries and other entities
 internet protocol ke do sanskaran upyog main hai: ai pi sanskaran 4 or ypi sanskaran 6
 sanskaran itihaas dekhen
) prayek sanskaran ek ypi adress ko alag dhang se paribhaashit karata he
 Because of its prevalence, the generic term IP address generally still refers to the address defined by ipv4
 ipv4, 32-bit adress kaa upyog karata he, jo adress sthaan ko 4,294,967,296 ) sambhav adwitiya adress par simit karata hai
 ipv4 reserves some addresses for special purposes such as private networks or multicast addresses
 isse ant upyogkartaaon ko niyat kiye jane vaale paton kii sankhya kam ho jaati he or jaise hi uplabdh paton kii sankhya kshay ho jaati he, ipv4 pataa samaapan nishchit ho jaataa he
 This foreseeable shortfall was the primary motivation for developing ipv6, which is in various deployment stages around the world, as the only strategy for ipv4 replacement and continued expansion of the Internet
 ipv4 adress aamtaur par dot-dashamalav sanketan main darshaae jate hai 
 Each part represents 8 bits of address and is therefore called octet
 takneekee lekhan ke kam aam maamalon main, ipv4 adress, shodash aadhari, ashtadhari, yaa binary abhivedan main prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 Each octet is changed individually in the most representation
 internet protocol ke vikaas ke praarambhik charan main, network ke prashaskon ne IP adress kaa do bhaagon main varnan kiya, network sankhya bhaag or mejabaan sankhya main bhaag
 ek adress main sarvocch kram ocotate ko network number abhinihit kiya jaataa tha or baaki ke bits rest field yaa host identiphire kehalaae jate the or network ke abhyantar mezbaan sankhyankan ke liye istemaal kiye jate the
 This method soon proved to be analogous as soon as additional networks were developed that were independent of the existing networks, which would have already been characterized by a network number
 1981 main, classphul network sanrachana ke samaveshan ke saath internet parichayan vinirdesh main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 Classful network design allowed a large number of individual network tasks
 ek IP adress ke sabase mahatvapurn ocotate ke pehle teen bit, adress kii shrenee ke rup main paribhaashit kiye gaye
 Three categories were defined for universal unicast detection
 vyutpann varg ke aadhaar par network pahchaan puure pate ke octate seemaa kshetron par aadhaarit tha
 Each category used sequentially extra octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the number of possible hosts in the higher class category
 nimna talika is faltah aprachlit pranali kaa ek simhavlokan detaa he
 The description of this design is explained in the article 'subnetwork' and 'classful Network'
 haalanki classphul network abhikalp ek safal vikasaatmak avasthaa thi lekin internet ke betahasha vistaar ke kaaran ise aage badhanaa mushkil ho gaya or jab nae ypi adress khand dene ke liye classles inter-domen rooting kaa srijan kiya gaya or rooting protocol ke liye ipivi4 adress kaa prayog karne ke liye nae niyam taiyaar kiye gaye to ise chhod diya gaya
 CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking for the allocation and routing of arbitrary-length prefixes
 aaj, classphul network sankalpana ke avshisht keval ek simit kshetra main kaam karte hai jo ki kuch network software or hardware ghatakon ke diphalt kanfigration maapdand hai or network prashaskon kii charchaa ke takneekee jorganon main prayukt hote hai
 In the initial network design, when the idea of connecting all Internet users globally from one bite to another for communication was intended, each computer or device had a unique IP address
 lekin yah paaya gaya ki hameshaa aisa kar paanaa sambhav nahin he kyonki nijee network viksit ho gaye or saarvajanik paton kaa sthaan sangrakshit karne kii jarurat padi 
 Computers that are not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only through TCP / IP, are not required to have a globally unique IP address
 nijee network ke liye ipv4 paton main se teen simaaen, har varg ke liye ek seemaa, 1918 RFC main arakshit thi
 These addresses are not routed over the Internet and hence there is no need to coordinate them with the register of IP addresses
 aaj, jab jarurat padati he, aise nijee network aamtaur par network pataa anuwaad ke madhyam se internet se conect ho jate hai
 Any user can use any reserved block

 The IP version 4 address space is rapidly approaching the closing of its officially available allocated address segments
 sangrakshan takneekon ke baavjood, ipv4 adress sthaan ke teji se samaapan ne internet ejineering task force ko internet kii parichayan kshamta kaa vistaar karne ke liye nai praudyogikiyon kaa pataa lagane ke liye prerit kiya
 Its permanent solution, a redesign of the Internet protocol itself, was understood
 internet protocol kii yah agali peedi, jiskaa uddeshy internet par ipv4 kii jagah lenaa tha, antat 1995 main ise internet protocol sanskaran 6 kaa naam diya gaya
 The address size was increased from 32 to 128 bit or 16 octets, which, even with a generous working of network blocks, is considered sufficient for the foreseeable future
 ganitiya, nayaa adress sthaan, adhiktam 2, yaa lagbhag 3
403×10 adwitiya pate kii kshamta pradaan karata he
 The new design is not only based on the goal of providing a sufficient amount of addresses, but to allow efficient aggregation of subnet routing prefixes to occur on the routing nodes
 parinamswaroop, anumaargan talika aakaar chota hota hai or sabase chota sambhav vyaktigat aavanton 264 host ke liye ek sabanet he, jo puure ipv4 internet ke aakaar kaa vargakar he
 At these levels, the actual address usage rate will be smaller on any ipv6 network segment

 ipv6 has features that, if there is a change in global connectivity or routing policy, automatically change the routing prefix of the entire network without internal redesigns or new numbering
 ipv6 paton kii badi sankhya vishisht prayojanon ke liye bade block nirdisht karne kii anumati dete he or jahaan uchit he, kushal maarg ke liye ekatrit hone kii
 a complex address protection technique with a large address space is not required, such as Classless used in inter-domain routing
 sabalmodern ke anusaar desktop or udhyam sarwar oparating system ipv6 protocol ke liye nishkapat samarthan shaamil karte hai, lekin yah abhi tak anya upkarnon jaise home netwarking raootraz, vois over internet protocol or multimedia upkaran or network paridhiy main vyapak rup se tainaat nahin hai
 Example of an ipv6 address: jaise ipv4 nijee yaa aantarik network ke liye adress arakshit karata he, ipv6 main nijee adress ke liye adress ke vibhaag alag se samucchy kiye hote hai
 In ipv6, these are referred to as unique local addresses
 RFC 4,193 is vibhaag ke liye anumaargan upsarg fc00:: / 7 alag se samucchy karata he, jo ki vibhinn uplakshith nitiyon ke saath do / 8 vibhaagon main vibhajit he adress main ek 40 bit chhadam yadrichhik sankhya shaamil hoti he jo sait vilay yaa packet ke galat maarg par chal jane se hone vaale adress muthbhed ke jokhim ko kam karti he
 Initial designs used a separate section for this purpose, dubbed site-local address
 However, the definition of what constitutes a site remained unclear and a poorly defined detection policy created doubt in routing
 adress range vinirdesh chhod diya gaya or ab nai vyavastha main istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 Addresses starting with fe80: - called link-local addresses - are assigned only in the local link area
 prayek network interfes ke liye oparating system ke IP parat dwaara aamtaur par swachaalit rup se adress utpann kiye jate hai
 This provides instant automatic network connectivity for any ipv6 host and means that if multiple hosts connect to a common hub or switch, they get an instant communication route via their link local ipv6 address
 ipv6 network prashasan kii nichali paraton main is suvidha kaa bade paimaane par or adhikansh upyogkartaaon ke liye apratyaksh rup se, istemaal kiya jaataa he 
 No private address prefix can be sent to the public internet
 sabnating kii takanic donon ipv4 or ipv6 network main kaam kar sakati hai
 The IP address is divided into two parts: the network address and the host identifier
 The subnet mask or CIDR prefix determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts
 shabd sabanet mask keval ipv4 main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Both IP versions, however, use the concept and notation of classless inter-domain routing
 is main, IP adress ke peeche ek slesh or network bhaag ke liye istemaal kii gai bits kii sankhya, jise maarg upsarg bhi kaha jaataa he, hote he
 For example, an ipv4 address and its subnet mask can be 192

 When a computer is configured to use the same IP address each time it becomes faster, it is called static IP address
 iske vipareet, un sthitiyon main jab computer ke ypi pate swatah hi niyukt kiye jate hai, use dinemic ypi adress ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Static IP address is assigned to the computer manually by an administrator
 isaki sateek prakriya platform ke anusaar pruthak hoti he
 These are not compatible with dynamic IP addresses, which are specified by either computer interfaces or self-hosted software, such as in Xerconf, or specified by a server using dynamic host configuration protocols
 haalanki DHCP ke upyog se nirdisht ypi adress lambey samay ke liye ek jaise rahete hai, vah aam taur par badal sakate hai
 In some cases, a network administrator may actively implement a specified static IP address
 is maamle main, ek DHCP sarwar kaa upyog hota he, lekin ek vishisht computer ko hameshaa ek hi ypi adress nirdisht karne ke liye, iskaa samanurup vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he
 This allows the static IP address to be primarily configured, not requiring each computer on the network to be specifically configured by a manual system
 static yaa statephul adress vinyas ke abhaav yaa vifaltaa main, ek parichaalan pranali ek network interphes ko state-les swachaalit-samakriti takanic, jaise xerokonf, ke upyog se ypi adress nirdisht kar sakati he
 Dynamic IP addresses are most frequently employed by dynamic host configuration protocol servers on lans and broadband networks
 inhen isliye istemaal kiya jaataa he kyunki yah ek network par prayek upkaran ke liye vishisht static adress nirdisht karne ke prashasnic boj se bachaa sakate he
 It also allows multiple devices to interact in a limited address space on a network, but only if some of them are online at a particular time
 In many current desktop operating systems, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default so that a user does not need to manually enter any settings to connect to a network with a DHCP server
 DHCP is not the only technique for specifying dynamic IP addresses
 dyaap or kuch broadband network bindu se bindu protocol kii gatisheel adress visheshtaayen upyog karte hai
 a sticky dynamic IP address or sticky IP cable and DSL is used by the Internet payer to describe a dynamically assigned IP address that often does not change
 pate aamtaur par DHCP protocol ke saath niyukt kiye jate he
 Since modems typically operate for extended periods of time, address leases are often regularized for longer periods and renewed upon expiration
 yadi ek modem band kar diya jaae or adress patte ke agle samaapan se pehle phir se sanchalit kiya jaae, to is baat kii sarvaadhik sambhaavna he ki use vahi IP adress praapt hoga
 The RFC 3330 defines an address block, 169
254
0
0 / 16, to be used exclusively in local-link addressing for ipv4 networks
 ipv6 main, sthitik yaa gatik adress kaaryon kaa upyog karne vaala, prayek interphes fe80:: / 10 sabanet main swatah ek sthaneey-link adress praapt karata he
 These addresses are valid only on the link, such as a local network segment or a point-wise connection to which a host is connected
 ye adress margskshmiya nahin hote or nijee adreson kii tarah internet packet pratibandhan ke strot yaa gantavy nahin ho sakate hai
 When the local-link ipv4 address block was reserved, no standard existed for the address auto-configuration mechanism

 Some infrastructure must use a static address, such as obtaining a host of the domain name system that converts the domain name to an IP address
 kisi interprize main sarwar sthapit karne ke liye sthitik adress suvidhajanak bhi he, parantu bilkul aavashyak nahin
 An address received from a DNS server comes with its own lifetime, or caching time, after which it should be viewed to confirm that it did not change
 yahan tak ki sthitik IP adress bhi network prabandhan ke parinamswaroop badal jaataa he
 According to today, firewalls are common on the Internet
 badi hui network suraksha ke liye, vah graahak ke saarvajanik ypi par aadhaarit nijee network ko abhigam niyantran karte hai
 Using a blacklist or white list, the IP address that is blocked is the client's stated public IP address, meaning if the client is using a proxy server or NAT, blocking an IP address can cause many different people Can be blocked
 IP adress prayog karne ke liye ekaadhik graahak upkaran pradarshit ho sakate hai: yaa to isliye kyonki vah ek saajhe hosting web sarwar vaataavaran kaa hissaa hai yaa kyonki ek ipv4 network adress anuvadak yaa proxi sarwar apane graahakon kii ore se ek madhyasth ke rup main kaam karata he, is avasthaa main, asli utpann IP adress ek anurodh praapt kar rahe sarwar se chhipe ho sakate he
 a common practice is for NAT to hide a large number of IP addresses in a private network
 NAT ke keval "bahari" interphes ko internet ruteble adress kii aavashkata he
 The most common net devices map TCP or UDP port numbers on the outside and individual private addresses on the inside
 jaise ek telephone number kaa site-vishesh vistaaran ho saktaa hai, port sankhya IP adress ke liye ek site-vishesh vistaaran hai
 In small home networks, NAT functions typically take place in a residential gateway device, typically sold as a "router"
 is paridrishy main, router se jude computer ke paas 'nijee' IP adress hoga or router ke paas internet ke saath samvaad karne ke liye ek shaskeey adress hoga
 This type of router allows multiple computers to share a public IP address

 "according to the Lord's order, Indra told Bali about the elimination of nectar from the churning of the sea
 daityaraj bali ne devraj indra se samjhauta kar liya or samudr manthan ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 The Mandarachal mountain was made a churner and Vasuki Nag a neti
 vasuki ke netra se netag kaa udbhav hua
 Lord Vishnu himself took the Kachhap avatar and placed Mandarachal mountain on his back and became its base
 bhagwaan narayan ne daanav rup se daanvon main or devtaa rup se devataaon main shakti kaa sanchaar kiya
 By giving deep sleep to Vasuki Nag too, he defeated his suffering
 devtaa vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney lage
 The demons, demons, demons and demons with vomiting intellect thought that there would be some benefit in catching Vasuki Nag from his mouth
 unhone devataaon se kaha ki ham kisi se shakti main kam nahin hai, ham munh kii ore kaa sthaan lenge
 Then the gods took the place on the tail side of Vasuki Nag
 "samudr manthan armbh hua or bhagwaan kacchap ke ek lakh yojan chaudee peeth par mandarachal parvat ghoomane laga
 Hey Rajan! The first to speak of sea churning was the poison of water
 us vish kii jwaala se sabhi devtaa tathaa daitya jalane lage or unki kaanti feeki padane lagi
 Everyone prayed to Lord Shankar on this
 unki prarthana par mahadev ji us vish ko hatheli par rakh kar use pi gayi kintu use kanth se neeche nahin utarane diya
 Due to the effect of that Kalkut poison, Shiva's gorge turned blue
 isiliye mahadev ji ko nilkantha kehete hai
 a little poison had dripped from his palm on the earth, which poisonous animals like snakes, scorpions, took
 "vish ko shankar bhagwaan ke dwaara paan kar lene ke pashchaat phir se samudr manthan prarambh hua
 The second jewel came out the Kamadhenu cow, which was kept by the sages
 phir ucchanshrava ghoda niklaa jise daityaraj bali ne rakh liya
 After that Airavat elephant came out which was taken by Devraj Indra
 airavat ke pashchaat kaustubhamani samudr se nikali use vishnu bhagwaan ne rakh liya
 Then Kalpavriksha came out and Apsara named Rambha emerged
 in donon ko devloak main rakh liya gaya
 Next, Lakshmi came out from churning the sea
 lakshmi ji ne swayan hi bhagwaan vishnu ko var liya
 After that Varuni appeared in the form of a girl whom the demons assumed
 phir ek ke pashchaat ek chandramaa, parijaat vriksh tathaa shankh nikle or ant main dhanvantari vaidya amrit kaa ghat lekar prakat huye
 "the demons snatched the nectar from Dhanvantari's hand and started fighting for it among themselves
 devataaon ke paas durvasa ke shaapvash itani shakti rahi nahin thi ki ve daityon se ladakar us amrit ko le saken isaliye ve niraash khadey huye unka aapas main ladanaa dekhte rahe
 Seeing the despair of the Gods, Lord Vishnu immediately took the form of Mohini and reached the demons fighting among themselves
 us vishwamohini rup ko dekhakar daitya tathaa devataaon kii to baat hi kya, swayan brahmagyani, kaamdev ko bhasma kar dene vaale, bhagwaan shankar bhi mohit hokar unki ore baar-baar dekhne lage
 When the demons saw that new young girl coming towards them, then they forgot all their quarrel and started looking at the beautiful girl and looked at them
 ve daitya bole, "he sundari! tum koun ho? lagata he ki hamaare jhagade ko dekhakar uskaa nibatara karne ke liye hi ham par krupa kataaksh kar rahi ho
 Come on! You are welcome
 hamen apane sundar kar kamalon se yah amritpan karaao
 Vishnu as Vishnu Mohini said, "O gods and demons!" Due to being the son of Maharishi Kashyap ji, both of you are brother and brother, yet you fight with each other
 main to swechhacharini stri hoon
 Wise people never believe such a woman, then how are you believing in me? It is good that you all join yourself and take Amritpan
 " On hearing such proverbial words of Vishwamohini, those humble demons, demons and asuras became even more confident in him
 ve bole, "sundari! ham tum par purna vishwaas he
 We will consume Amritpan in the same way you will share
 tum ye ghat le lo or ham sabhi main amrit vitaran karo
 "vishwamohini took the nectar and asked the gods and the demons to sit in separate rows
 uske baad daityon ko apane kataaksh se madahosh karte huye devataaon ko amritpan karaane lage
 The demons became so obsessed with their sarcasm that they forgot to drink nectar
 bhagwaan kii is chaal ko rahu naamak daitya samaj gaya
 He sat down among the gods after making the form of a deity and put the received nectar in the mouth
 jab amrit uske kanth main pahunch gaya tab chandramaa tathaa surya ne pukaar kar kaha ki ye rahu daitya he
 Hearing this, Lord Vishnu immediately separated his head from the neck with his Sudarshan Chakra
 amrit ke prabhaav se uske sir or dhad rahu or ketu naam ke do grah ban kar antariksh main sthapit ho gayi
 He is the one who gets the sun and the moon due to hatred
 is tarah devataaon ko amrit pilaakar bhagwaan vishnu vahaan se lop ho gayi
 The demise of the demons ended soon after their disappearance
 ve atyant krodhit ho devataaon par prahaar karne lage
 The fierce Devasur war started in which Devraj Indra defeated Daityaraj Bali and withdrew his Indralok

 Just before the match, players rotate a racket to decide who will serve first

 To perform a correct serve, one leg of the server must touch the service box and must not touch any part of the service field when hitting the ball
 racket se lagane ke baad, gend ko saamne vaali diwaar par sarvice rekha se upar or bahari rakhaa ke andar takaraana chahie hai or vahaan se use vipareet quarter court main girnaa chahie

 During the game, points are earned when: jahaan sarwar in chizon main se koi bhi karata he, yaa sarv ko maarane main vifal rahata he, to khilaadi bhoomikaaon ko badal lete hai or praptakarta agle ank ko sarv karata he, lekin koi ank nahin miltaa he
 The game is played up to 9 points
 Competition matches are usually played until the "best of Five"
 Once upon a time this scoring system was preferred in the UK, but it was also the countries that had traditional relations with the UK, such as Australia, Canada, Pakistan, South Africa, India, but now at a competitive level, PARS to 11 Only used
 vaikalpik rup se, point-e-raily-scoring system main, us vyakti dwaara ank arjeet kiye jate hai jo prayek raily jeetta he, chaahe usne sarv kiya ho yaa nahin
 Traditionally, PARS scoring was up to 15 points
 However, in 2004, PARS scoring was reduced to 11 for professional sports
 PARS is now used on men's professional tours and the tin height has been reduced by two inches for men's professional tournaments
 The original height of tin is used in women's professional tours, but as of July 11, 2008, it has started using the PARS to 11 scoring system

 khele jane vaale shot ke kai prakaar hote hai jo dilachasp khel or ranneeti pesh karte hai
 1
 Straight drive or 'rail: The ball is struck parallel and close to the side wall so that it goes deep behind the court
 This is often referred to as a 'good length' shot
 2
 bost : gend ko saamne kii diwaar se takaraane se pehle bagal kii diwaar par yaa peeche kii diwaar par ek kone main khelaa jaataa he
 3
 Volley: The ball is hit 'full', usually directly on the front wall
 4
 drop shot: gend ko saamne kii diwaar par aaraam se maaraa jaataa he, taaki vah farsh par dhire se saamne ke kone main gire
 5
 Lob: The ball is hit slow and high on the front wall with a high arch, so that it falls into the back corner of the court
 6
 cross court: gend ko saamne kii diwaar par dayee ore se bain ore maaraa jaataa he 
 7
 Kill: The ball is hit hard and down on the front wall so that it does not reach beyond half of the court
 8
 trical bost: ek 'chota' bost jahaan gend ko court ke saamne, bagal vaali diwaar par maaraa jaataa he 
 9
 Squeeze's Boast: a relatively difficult shot that is hit from the front of the court when the ball is very close to the adjacent wall
 iskaa asar trical bost ke samaan hi hota he, lekin apni kathinaayee kii vajah se yah adhik bhraamak he
 10
 Skid Boast: The ball is hit high on the adjacent wall near the front wall so that it falls into the opposite back corner, passing through the court
 11
 nik shot: gend ko 'woli' kiya jaataa he yaa ek oochaal par maaraa jaataa he, cross court or itani shakti ke saath ki vah saamne kii diwaar se takaraati he phir bagal vaali diwaar ke jankshan se or farsh se 
 jab acchhee tarah se maaraa jaataa he to gend main kam yaa koi oochaal nahin hoti he or yah farsh ke saath ludhakti he 
 a common strategy is to hit the ball up from the side walls directly to the back corners; This is the basic squash shot, referring to it as a "rail", straight drive, wall, or "length"
 is shot ko maarane ke baad, khilaadi court ke centre main "T" ke paas chalaa jaataa he taaki vah pratidwandvi kii vaapasi kaa saamana karne ke liye behatar sthiti main ho
 Attacking with a light or "short" shot in the front corners results in the opponent covering the majority of the court, allowing the winner to immediately emerge
 gend ke saamne tak pahunchane se pehle hi bost yaa angel shot ko jaanboojh kar ek ore kii bagal vaali diwaar par maaraa jaataa he
 This shot is used to deceive and the opponent again to cover most of the court
 squash main ek pramukh ranneeti he "T par haaavee hona" 
 kushal khilaadi shot ko lautaaenge or phir aglaa shot khilne se pehle "T" kii ore waapas chale jaaenge
 is sthiti se, virdohi ke agle shot ko praapt karne ke liye, khilaadi shighrata se nunatam harkaton ke saath court ke kisi bhi bhaag kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 There may be 30 or more shots at rallies between experienced players and therefore special emphasis is placed on fitness, both aerobic and non-aerobic
 As players become more efficient, in particular, getting better at getting a shot, scoring points often becomes a war of attrition
 khel ke ucch str par, zyaada chust-durust khilaadi behatar laabh kii sthiti main hota he
 The ability to change the direction of the ball at the last moment is also important to counterbalance the opponent
 visheshgy khilaadi, ek ausat khilaadi kii tulana main adhik tikshnata ke saath second ke dasven hisse main pratidwandvi ke shot ko bhaanp sakate hai, jisase unhen sheeghra pratikriya karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Since two players are confined within a shared space, interference and hindrance are essential aspects of the game
 aam taur par, niyam ke anusaar khilaadi, gend ko saamne kii diwaar se takaraane se pehle spasht dekhne ke liye, gend kaa sidhi rekha main sidhe saamana karne liye, court ke kisi bhi hisse main ek uchit ghumaav or ek bina baadha ke shot maarane, chaahe saamne, bagal main, yaa peeche kii diwaar par maarane ke liye jisamen ve sakasham hai, ve hakdaar hai
 When interference occurs, a player may appeal for a "lay" and the referee explains the extent of the interference
 referi, ek let kii anumati dene kaa chunaav kar saktaa he or phir khilaadi us ank ko phir se khelte hai, yaa hastkshep ke str par nirbhar karte hue apil karne vaale khilaadi ko ek "stroke" pradaan kar saktaa he, referi dekhtaa he ki kya hastkshep karne vaale khilaadi ne ise bachaane ke liye paryaapt prayaas kiye or kya baadhit khilaadi dwaara ek nirnaayak shot lagane kii sambhaavna thi, agar use baadhit nahin kiya gaya hota
 An exception to all of this is when the intervening player is directly in the path of the other player's movement and effectively stops that action, a stroke is always awarded in such a case
 jab yah samajha jaataa he ki baadha bahut kam thi yaa nahin thi, yaa donon hi bataanaa asambhav hota he to, niyam ke anusaar, khel kii nirantarata banaae rakhane ke liye or let ke liye farji apil ko hatotsahit karne ke liye koi let pradaan karne kii anumati nahin di jaani chahie
 Because of the subjective symptoms in explaining the nature of the intervention and its intensity, the rendering of lat and stroke is often controversial
 jab ek khilaadi kaa shot saamne kii diwaar par lagane se pehle uske pratidwandvi ko chooti he to ise ek hastkshep mana jaataa he
