 Hemachandra is his independent opinion about originality

 This method has been the source of many possible errors: many fatal attacks may not have been reported at all; a study cannot collect all the necessary information; And there is also the possibility of misidentifying the breeds of dogs, although courts in the United States and Canada have ruled that the identification of breeds by experts with respect to the use of published racial standards would be sufficient for the enforcement of breed-specific legislation 
 It is possible to identify the breed of dogs by DNA testing, but for any one dog, the results of this test can vary greatly depending on the laboratory testing it and the number of purebred dogs available in that laboratory

 Clifton acknowledges that the records "do not in any way list fatal or other serious attacks by dogs" because it contains "dogs whose breed is uncertain, 


 police dogs, guard dogs And excludes attacks by dogs specifically trained for fighting
 

" The study found that the number of dogs killed by a dog attack over a period of 27 years was 345, of which the alleged "pit bull terrier", or their hybridization 159, or about 46 of the total number of dog attacks identified by the study Percentages were responsible for the deaths

 jo mudda praasangik he vah he bimit raashi kaa jokhim
 yadi kisi bhi anya kute kaa vyavhaar bigadataa he, to vah kisi na kisi ko katata he, lekin yah itnaa bura bahi hota ki jisase vah vyakti mar jaye yaan jivan bhar ke liye aapng ho jaye or bimit raashi kaa jokhim bhi isi ke anusaar hota he
 But if the behavior of a pit bull terrier deteriorates, one is often killed or crippled — and because of this the risk of the sum insured is now exorbitant, for which both the dog and their prey are to be paid

 " The following table summarizes Pit Bull-related fatal cases filed by news agencies in the United States between 2005 and 2009: pit bul-prakaar ke kutton se sambandhit anekon adhik prachaarit maamalon ke falswaroop kai adhikaar kshetron ne nasl vishesh par aadhaarit kanoon pravartit kiye hai or kuch sarkari sansthaaon jaise sanyukt rajya sena or marine corps ne prashaskeey kaarywahi bhi kii he
 These actions range from a direct ban on keeping pit bull-type dogs to rules and restrictions on the ownership of a pit bull, and often also have a legal presumption that a pit bull-type dog is prima facie a "dangerous" "or" rogue "dog
 isaki pratikriya main sanyukt rajya main kuch rajya sarkaron ne us rajya ke andar nagarmahapalika dwaara nasl vishesh par aadhaarit kanoon pravartit karne ke adhikaar ko pratibandhit yaa nishedh kar diya he, haalanki nasl vishesh par aadhaarit in kanoonon ke nishedh se us rajya main sthit sainya ikaiyon ko koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 It is now generally accepted in legal matters that they have the authority to promulgate race-based legislation under jurisdiction in the United States and Canada; However, there is still controversy over the efficacy of breed-specific legislation to prevent dog bites
 ek drushtikon yah he ki pit bul kute saarvajanik suraksha kaa ek aisa mudda hai jo nimnaankit kaarywahiyon ko sahi sabit karata he jaise, swaamitv par pratibandh, sabhi pit bul kutton ke liye andashay uchhedan / napunsakata kii anivaaryta, microchip lagane or uttardaayitv beemaa kii anivaaryta yaa un logon kaa nishedh jo pit bul ke swaamitv ko lekar kisi aparaadh ke doshi hai
 The second approach is to introduce a comprehensive "dog bite" law that includes sophisticated consumer education and the practice of legally keeping pets responsibly for this problem of dangerous dogs, a breed-based law enforcement Compared would be a good solution
 teesraa drushtikon yah he ki nasl vishesh par aadhaarit kanoon puri tarah se nasl ko pratibandhit nahin kar sakate lekin unhen kathorta purvak sharton ko niyamit karnaa hoga jiske antargat kuch khaas naslon kaa hi adhikaar praapt kiya ja sakegaa, udahaaran ke taur par, kuch vishesh varg ke vyaktiyon ko inkaa adhikaar paane se pratibandhit karnaa, un saarvajanik kshetron kii ghoshnaa kerani hogi jahaan un kutton ke aane par pratibandh hoga or aisi sharton kaa nirmaan karnaa hoga jaise ki, kuch vishesh nasl ke kutton ko saarvajanik sthanon par le jane par kutton dwaara mukhrodhani kaa pahana janaa, aadi
 antat, kuch sarkarein jaise australia ne, kuch vishesh naslon ke aayat par pratibandh laga diya he or dhire dhire in naslon kii jansankhya ko samaapt karne ke swaabhaavik sangharshan prayaas main sabhi maujuuda kutton ke andashay uchhedan / napunsakata ko anivaary kar diya he
 Their owners can be held legally responsible for the injuries inflicted by dogs in the United States
 aam taur par, kutton ke maalikon ko tab jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he jab ve apane kute ko sanbhaalane main yaa use rokane ke prati laaparvaah rahe hon, yaa tab jab ki unhen pehle se yah pataa ho ki unka kutta logon ko jakhmi karne kii ore pravrutt rahata he; haalanki kute ke maalik aisi ghatnaon ke liye sidhe hi jimmedaar ho jate hai yadi sthaneey kanoon kute dwaara kii gayi kshati ke liye uske maalik ko hi purna rup se jimmedaar maanata ho, yahaan laaparvaahee yaa kute kii pravriti ke vishay main pehle se jaanane yaa nahin jaanane se koi fark nahin padataa
 grihaswamiyon or kiraayedaaron kii beemaa policy main vishesh rup se kutton dwaara ghayal kiye jane ke maamalon main 100,000 dollar se lekar 300,000 dollar tak kii beemaa vyapti hoti he; haalanki, kuch beemaa companiyaan kutton dwaara kaate jane ke maamalon main un kutton par pratibandh lagane ke dwaara, jinke maalikon kaa beemaa unhone kiya he, bimaakrit raashi ke daavon se sambandhit rin jokhim ko simit kar leti hai
 These restrictions do not include cases of dog bites in insurance policies; Increase in insurance rates for owners of certain dog breeds; The requirement of special training for owners of certain breeds or their dogs to pass the American Canal Club Canine Good Citizen Test; Dog owner's compulsion to prohibit his dog in a mouthwash, chain or siege and refusal to write a policy in relation to homeowners and tenants owning certain breeds
 ohio main, jisane pit bul-prakaar ke sabhi kutton ko "khatarnaak" ghoshit kar diya he, vishesh daayitv beemaa jo pit bul-prakaar ke kute dwaara kii gayi kshati ko simit karata ho, uski laagat 575 dollar prati varsh se bhi adhik ho sakati he
 Owners of a rented property can also be held liable for the damage done by the dog if they know that an aggressive dog is living in their property and yet they have ensured the safety of the other tenants living in that place
 Did nothing to do; As a result, many leased properties prohibit pit bull-type dogs or other types of dogs from owning property if their insurance does not include the damage done by the dog of that breed to their policy
 so
 Breeds often identified by insurance companies include Pit Bull-type dogs, Rottweiler dogs, German Shepherd dogs, Daberman Pinchers, Acitas and Chow dogs
