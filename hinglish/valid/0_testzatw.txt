 a polar orbit is an orbit in which an artificial satellite passes over or nearly above both poles in a complete circle on each orbit of a body
 Due to this, its inclination is 90 degrees from the equator
 Generally this body is like the Earth or possibly the Sun
 Except in the special case of polar geosynchronous orbit, the satellite in polar orbit passes at a different longitude above the equator in each of its orbits

 This can be particularly important for applications such as remote sensing of atmospheric temperature
 It is necessary to reconcile with the local time by the orbiting satellite, which may change over time
 In order to keep the same local time on a given pass, it is desirable for the class to be as short as possible, that is to say as low as possible
 However, very low orbits of a few hundred kilometers will rapidly decay due to blockage from the atmosphere
 The normal height used is about 1000 km, it creates an orbital period of about 100 minutes

 Jarvis Laurie is traveling from France to England to bring Dr
 Alexander Manet, an employee of Bank Taleson, to London

 Nobody knows who Evermond is because Darnay has kept his real name a secret in England

 The letter is sent by Gabel, a servant of the former Marquis

 Lorry in an effort to free Darnay

 lekin usee shaam daarne ko phir giraftaar kar liya jaataa he or difaarge parivaar or ek "kisi agyaat" dwaara lagaae nae aaropon ke kaaran agle din phir se mukadmaa chalaaya jaataa he
 We soon learn from the testimony of his statement that this is the second Dr
 Manet, Manet does not know that his statement has been found and is horrified when his words are used to condemn him
 kisi kaam par, miss pros apane gumshuda bhai solaaman pros ko dekhakar chakit ho jaati he lekin pros nahin chahta ki use pahachaanaa jaae

 Carton threatens that he will identify Solomon as an Englishman and chancellor who spies for France or Britain at his convenience
 agar yah bataa diya gaya to solaaman ko nishchit rup se maar diya jayega, is tarah carton kaa palada baari he
 In the Tribunal, Darnay encounters the Mussoorie Defarge who identifies Darnay as Marquis St
 Evermond and reads Dr
 Manet's letter hidden in his chamber in Bastille
 difaarge evermmond ke rup main daarne kii pahchaan kar saktaa he kyonki pustak 2, adhyay 16 main difaarge parivaar kii sharaab kii dukaan par jab barsaad jaankaree ikatthi kar rahaa tha to barsaad ne use daarne kii pahchaan bataayi thi
 The letter described how Dr
 Manette was locked up in Bastille by the deceased Marquis Evermond and his own twin brother for trying to report their crimes against a peasant family
 chota bhai ek ladki par mugdh ho gaya tha
 He kidnaps her, rapes her and kills her husband, upon receiving the news that her father died and her brother was killed in a fight to protect her honor
 jis kisaan stri kaa balaatkaar hua tha uske bhai ne marane se pehle parivaar ke antim sadsy, apni choti bahan ko, "kahin surakshit" chipa diya tha
 The end of the article denounces the Evermond family, "him and his descendants, the last man of the breed"
 dow manet bhaybheet ho uthta he lekin uske virodh kii upeksha kar di jaati he-use apni ninda waapas lene kii anumati nahin he
 Darnay is sent to the Conservatory and sentenced to guillotine the next day
 carton difaarge parivaar kii sharaab kii dukaan main chalaa jaataa he jahaan vah daarne ke baaki ke parivaar ko pratadit karne kii madam difaarge kii yojanaon ke bare main sun letaa he
 Carton learns that Madame Defarge was the surviving sister of the peasant family that was destroyed by the Evermond family
 kathanak kii ekmaatr jaankaree jisase madam difaarge ke liye koi sahanubhuti utpann ho sakati he vah he ki uskaa parivaar kho chukaa he or ki uskaa koi naam nahin he
 "defarge" is the name after her marriage, and Dr
 Manette does not know her family name, though he asks her dying sister
 jab dow manet raat bhar charles ko bachaane ke vifal prayaason se hataash hokar agali subah lautataa he to us par juute banane kaa paagalpan phir savaar ho jaataa he
 Carton urges Laurie to flee Paris with Lucy, her father, and "little Lucy"
 usee subah carton jail main daarne se mulaakaat karata he
 Carton makes Darne unconscious with the drug and Barsad brings Darne out of prison
 carton- jo itnaa zyaada daarne ke samaan dikhataa he ki england main daarne ke mukademe main ek gavaah unamem antar nahin bataa saktaa-daarne hone kaa naatak karne kaa or uske sthaan par marane kaa faisalaa karata he
 He does this by remembering his promise to Lucy, for the love of her
 carton ke pehle nirdeshon kaa paalan karte hue daarne kaa parivaar or lorie buggy main ek behosh aadmi jiske paas pahchaan patr carton ke hai lekin vastav main daarne he, ke saath paris or frans se palaayan kar jate hai
 Meanwhile, Madame Defarge, armed with a pistol, goes to the Lucie family residence hoping to catch them mourning for the scare but Lucy, her child, Dr
 Manette, and Mr
 Laurie are already gone
 unhen bachaav kaa samay dene ke liye, miss pros madam difaarge se bhid jaati he or unmensangharsh hota he
 Pross speaks only English and Defarge only French, so no one can understand each other
 In the fight, Madame Defarge's pistol goes off, she is killed; Miss Pross is permanently deaf due to the noise of the shot and the shock of Madame Defarge's death
 upanyaas sidney carton ko gilotine karne ke saath samaapt hota he
 Carton's final thoughts foretell: Carton appears that several revolutionaries, including Defarge, Barsad, and The Vengeance, will be sent to guillotine themselves and that Darnay and Lucy will have a son they will name after Carton : Son who will fulfill all the promises left incomplete by the carton
 pustak kii shuruyaat main lusi or daarne kaa pehla betaa paidaa hota he or ek hi para ke bheetar mar jaataa he
 It is likely that this first son arrives in the novel so that his second son, named Carton, may represent another way in which Carton restores Lucy and Darnay through his sacrifice
 —final sentence of a Tale of Two Cities a Tale of Two Cities is one of only two historical novels by Charles Dickens
 charles dicens ke ek vishisht upanyaas kii tulana main isamen kam paatr or up-kathanak hai
 The author's primary historical source was The French Revolution: a History by Thomas Carlile: Charles Dickens wrote in the Preface to the Tale that "one cannot hope to add anything to the philosophy of Mr
 Carlyle's wonderful book"
 Goes through the cycle of revival, having a significant impact on the novel, portrayed particularly well by the life and death of Sidney Carton Or was
 dicens angrezi bolne main asamarth paatro ke liye francisi muhaavaron ke shabdic anuwaad kaa upyog karte hai jaise, "us gali main tum kya karte ho?!!" And "where is my husband? --- Here you see me
 " upanyaas ke penguin clasix sanskaran main note diya gaya he ki "sabhi pathakon ne prayog ko kaamyaab nahin mana he
 " dicens apane hasya ke liye vikhyath hai lekin i tail of tu citis unki sabase kam hasyakaarak pustak he
 Nonetheless, Jerry Cruncher, Miss Pross and Mr
 Stryver provide comedy
 vibhinn drushtikonon ko darshane ke liye dicens pustak main vyangy kaa upyog hasya ke rup main karte hai
 The book is full of tragic circumstances so there is not much room for Dickens' humor
 = In Dickens's England, resurrection is always in a Christian context
 mote taur par, sidney carton kii aatma upanyaas ke ant main punerjeevit kii jaati he And more realistically, the "first book" deals with the death of Dr
 Manet from incarcerated death to rebirth
 punerjeevan pehali baar tab prakat hota he jab shri lorie jeri crunchar ke sandesh kaa uttar "jivan ko vaapasi" shabdon ke saath dete hai
 Mr
 Laurie's resurrection is also revealed to Dowager during his ride to the cab, as he constantly contemplates the assumed conversation with Dr
 Manet: he believes that he is helping Dr
 Manet revive, and that imagination Let's do this by "digging" himself and removing Dr
 Manette from the grave
 punerjeevan upanyaas kaa mukhya vishay he
 Revival is first seen in Jarvis Laurie's thoughts about Dr
 Manette as a subject matter
 yahi antim vishay-vastu bhi he: carton kaa balidaan
 dicens multah puure upanyaas ko ricold tu life kaa naam dena chaahate the
 Jerry is also part of this recurring theme: he is involved in death and resurrection in a way that the reader does not yet know
 Its first foreshadowing is found in his own commentary: "jerry, if life returns to fashion, you will be silver!" The somber humor of this statement becomes apparent much later
 paanch saal baad, ek andheri or badalon bhari raat, shri lorie jeri se yah kahkar ki "yah bahut-kuch 


mritkon ko kabr se baahar laane kii raat he," rahasyatmakataa main pathak kii ruchi ko punarjagrit karte hai
 Jerry firmly replies that he has never seen her do this at night
 pataa lagata he ki punerjeevan kii vishay-vastu ke saath jeri crunchar kii bhagidaariyahi he ki vah victorian bhashaa main kaha jane vaala "punerjeevan dene vaala manushya" he, vah jo chikitsa se jude logon ko bechney ke liye shavon ko khod nikaalata he 
 Undoubtedly, the opposite of resurrection is death
 mrityu or punerjeevan upanyaas main aksar dikhaai dete hai
 Dickens is displeased that courts in France and England award capital punishment for trivial offenses
 frans main kisi kuleen kii jhak par bina koi mukadmaa kiye kisaanon ko maut ke ghat tak utaar diya jaataa he
 Marquis happily tells Darnay that "in the next room, a man 


 was stabbed at the site in honor of his daughter - for talking to his daughter with a grudge about a delicious meal
" " Interestingly, the destruction of Dr
 Manette's shoe-making bench by Miss Pross and Mr
 Laurie has been described as "burning the body"
 yah spasht lagata he ki yah ek durlabh maamla he jahaan mrityu yaa vinaash kaa sakaaratmak arth he kyonki "jalanaa" doctor ko uske lambey karawas kii smriti se mukt karne main madad karata he
 But Dickens's description of this kind and formal work is very ajeeb he: The destruction and secrecy of the true mind so much that Mr
 Laurie and Miss Pross, while doing their work and erasing its marks, feel this and feel as if they are involved in a crime
 sidney carton kii shahadat use ateet main kiye gaye uske sabhi galat kaamon se mukt karti he
 During the last few days of his life he also finds God by repeating Christ's relieving words, "I am the resurrection and the life"
 punerjeevan upanyaas ke antim bhaag kii pramukh vishay-vastu he
 Darnay is saved at the last moment and recalled to life, Carton chooses death and resurrection in place of a life better than his own: "he was the face of a very calm man
 

 vah udaatt or dev samaan dikh rahaa tha"
 In a broader sense, at the end of the novel Dickens was forced from the ashes of the old in France
 ek punerjeevit saamaajik vyavastha kii ummid dikhti he
 Many would agree with the typical European tradition, Hans Beederman, who writes that water is "the fundamental symbol of all the energy of the unconscious — an energy that can be dangerous even if it crosses its proper limits
" yah pratikwaad dicens ke upanyaas ko raas aata haih i tail of tu citis main aksar jal kaa bimb kisaanon kii bheed ke badhate krodh kaa pratik he, aisa krodh jisase kuch had tak dicens sahanubhuti rakhte hai lekin antat ise tarkahin or pashavik bhi maanate hai
 At the beginning of the book, Dickens explains this by writing, "the sea did what it liked and loved destruction
" " yahan samudr bheed yaa krantikariyon ke aane kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 When Gaspard kills Marquis, he is "hanged there at a height of forty feet — and left hanging, poisoning the waters
" kuen kii vishaaktata gaspard ke vadh se kisaanon kii samuhik bhaavana par pade katu prabhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 After Gaspard's death, the raid on Bastille is led by the Defarge family, "since the boiling water is the focal point of the vortex, all of this outbreak revolves around Defarge's liquor store and is drawn towards the vortex
 The trend was in every human drop of the pan
 

" The crowd is envisioned as a sea
 "aisi garjan ke saath jisase lage maano ki frans kii samast saans ne ek ghinaune shabd kaa rup le liya ho, sajiv samudr main lahar par lahar, gaharaai par gaharaai kaa ufaan aayaa or shahar ko jalmagn kar gaya
 

 " daarne ke jailer ko "bhadde bhang se foole chehre or sharir vaala aadmi jo maano dub gaya ho or pani se bhar gaya ho" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Later, during the reign of terror, the revolution "became so overbearing and distracting 


 that the rivers of the south were filled with dead bodies of violently submerged at night
 

" a crowd later "bad rahi he or paas kii galiyon main bah nikali he
 

 Carmenola takes everyone in himself and takes them away
 " During a fight with Miss Pross, Madame Defarge clings to her in a way that is "more than a drowning woman's grip"
 upanyaas par tippaneekaron ne us vidambnaa par dhyaan diya he ki madam difaarge apni hi bandook se maari jaati he or shaayad uparyukt kathan se dicens sanket karte hai ki madam difaarge jaisi shaatir pratishodh kii bhaavana antat apane shikariyon ko bhi nasht kar degi
 Many read the novel in Freud's light, ahem and ahem
 Yet Carton in his final move sees a tornado that "wandered aimlessly until the stream absorbed it into the ocean" —a saturation even though the work and ahem Driven but there is a frenetic union with the subconscious
 jaisaa ki angrezi sahitya main aam he, prakaash or andhkaar achchhai or buraai ke pratik hai
 Lucy Manette is often associated with light and Madame Defarge with darkness
 lusi pehali baar difaarge parivaar dwaara rakhe gaye kamare main She meets her father
 " lusi ke bal khushi kaa pratik hai jab vah "unhen ek saath baandhne ke liye sunaharaa dhaagaa" baandhti he
 She is embellished with "very bright and shining diamonds", and symbolizes the joy of her wedding day
 andhera anischitata, bhay or jokhim kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Mr
 Laurie leaves Dowager in the dark, dark in the prisons, chasing the black Saiyadam Defarge, harassing Dr
 Manette in a deep, sad melancholy, his arrest and closure are shrouded in darkness, the Marquis's possessions of the night
 Burned in the dark, Jerry Cruncher loots the tombs in the dark, Charles's second arrest is also in the night
 lusi or shri lorie donon ko madam difaarge se gaharaa khatra mahasoos hota he
 Lucy comments, "that terrible woman seems to be possessed by me"
 Although Mr
 Laurie tries to comfort him, "that too overshadows the manner of the Defarge family
" " Madame Defarge is "like a shadow on a white road", snow is a symbol of purity and Madame Defarge is a symbol of dark corruption
 dicens khun ke gahare rang kii tulana bhi shuddh safed barf se karte hai: rakt ise bahaane waalon ke aparaadhon kaa rang le letaa he
 As a child, Charles Dickens was forced to work in the factory because of his bitter experience, sympathizing with the persecuted poor
 tathaapi krantikariyon ke saath uski sahanubhuti sirf ek seemaa tak hi thi, vah bheed ke paagalpan kii aalochana karata he jo jald hi chaa jaataa he
 When one night the mad men and women massacre eleven hundred detainees and return quickly to lay their arms on San, they display "eyes for which any kindly spectator would see a properly pointed gun
 It would have taken twenty years of life together
 " pathak ko dikhaaya gaya he ki frans or england main garibon par ek jaise hi atyaachaar hote hai
 As crime continues to increase, the executioner in England is "tying long queues of miscellaneous criminals, now hanging burglars

 The difference in irregular form is lack of eutectility, presence of musculoskeletal and atrial fibrillation
 aniyamit timothy syndrome se peedit logon ko zyaadaatar chehre sambandhi vikaar, jaise kii adhik ubhara hua maathaa or jeebh, hote hai
 Eventually, a person suffering from irregular Timothy Syndrome has uneven development in which the upper part of his body develops normally while the lower part of his body is like a 2 or 3-year-old

 The sequencing of the CACNA1C gene additionally confirms the diagnosis
 timothy syndrome ke do pahachaane hue prakaar hai, shastreey or aniyamit 
 ye donon CACNA1C jin main muteshan ke kaaran hote hai
 Mutations caused by Timothy syndrome cause delays in channel closure and thus increase cellular excitability
 donon shastreey or aniyamit timothy syndrome CACNA1C main muteshan ke kaaran hote hai
 These mutations occur in exon 8 and exon 8a, another gene coupled exon
 exon 8A hryday, mastishk, gastrointestinal pranali, fefdon, pratiraksha pranali or chikani mansapeshi main behtareen taur se vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Exon 8 is also expressed in these places and its level is 5 times higher than Exon 8A
 shastreey kaik syndrome se peedit marijon main G406R naamak ek muteshan chhathi jhilli ke thoda sa peeche sthit hota he jo domen 1 ke khand kii lambaai kaa hota he
 Glycine preserved at this location seems critical for smooth voltage dependent inactivation, as mutants are inefficient in this department
 aniyamit timothy syndrome ke muteshan isi prakaar ke hai; ek duusari jin yugman main hone vaala bilkul samaan G406R mutesan or doosraa kuch amino acid apstreemon main hone vaala G402S mutesan
 in muteshnon kaa channel functionon par hone vaala asar shastreey timothy syndrome par G406R muteshan ke asar jaisaa hi he
 The lack of smooth voltage dependent inactivation in these mutants produces prolonged current and depolarization during cardiac action potentials

 The expression of stuned exon 8 is significantly higher in the heart than that of exon 8A, in patients with irregular timothy syndrome, heart diseases are significantly more dangerous than patients with classical timothy syndrome

 Similarly, the mother of a couple of patients with Timothy syndrome also had mutations, but she also lacked any obvious phenotype

 raja, rajya or chhatra kii shakti or samprabhutaa kaa dyotak or kisi apradhi ko uske aparaadh ke nimitt di gayi sajaa ko dand kehete hai
 In another context, one of the four measures of Political Science - Sama, Daam, Dand and Bhed
 dand kaa shabdic arth 'danda' he jisase kisi ko peeta jaataa he
 In the sacramental area, the punishment mainly being held by Brahmachari Vidyarthi can be mentioned
 grihyasutron, smritiyon, unki tikaaon, vrihatsamhita tathaa saadharantaya dharamshastra ke anya granthon main tatsambandhi vishad vivaran milte hai
 Accordingly, when Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are Sanskrit from Upanayana rites through Yagyavidhi by Acharya in different stages, they are also required to bear benign and observant punishments
 shastragat vidhaan or paramparaagat manyataayen ye hai ki brahman balak keshantaparyant vilvadand, kshatriya balak lalaatparyant palashdand or vaishyabalak nasikaparyant udumbar kaa dand dhaaran karen 
 The term punishment is mainly used in relation to political science and administration
 jiske dwaara aparaadhiyon ko dandit kiya jaay vahi dand he, kintu iskaa prayog hota he rajya or shashan kii seemaa ke bheetar
 When it is used outside the state's border towards any enemy, friend, mediator or indifferent state, it becomes one of the four measures of politics and it means military experiment
 in baton ke vichaar se sambandh rakhanevaala shaastra hota he dandashastra or uski niti hoti he dandniti
 Punishment is the science of government and administration, the basis of which is to follow morality and law, which applies equally to both the punisher and the punisher
 uske bina lokyatra sambhav nahin
 
 kaamandak nitisar or mahabharat kii paribhaasha ke anusaar aparaadhon kaa daman hi dand athwa "niti" kehalaata he
 The person who performs this work means the symbol of this quality is called 'dandi', because of Nayan
 shankaracharya ne kaamandak kii tikaa karte hue manusmriti ko uddhrut kiya he, jahaan yah kaha gaya he ki sampurna lok dand ke bhay ke kaaran hi jagat kaa bhoga sambhav ho paata he
 Clearly, punishment had great importance in Indian political science which was expressed in both real and symbolic forms
 dand ke bare main manusmriti main bahut baaten kahi gayi hai
 Manu says that the one who is punished is the king, he is the preacher of justice and the ruler of all, he is the surety of the religion of the four varnas and ashrams
 vahi raja va dand praja kaa shashankartta, sab praja kaa rakshak, sote hue prajasth manushyon main jaagta he, isi liye budhimaan log dand hi ko dharm kehete hai
 If the king wears the punishment properly, he makes all the subjects happy and if he is tried without thinking, he kills the king from all sides
 vina dand ke sab varna arthath praja dooshit or sab maryaada chhin-bhinn ho jaati he
 Due to non-compliance of the punishment, all the people can be wrath against the king and the state system
 yah bhi kaha he ki dand bada tejomay he jise avidvan va adharmatma dhaaran nahin kar saktaa
 Then in such a situation, he destroys only the king without punishment and his family
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jo raja vidya, sushiksha se rahit, vishyon main aasakt va mudh he, vah nyaay se dand ko chalaane main samarth kabhi nahin ho saktaa
 Punishment originated with the origin of statehood
 manusmriti or mahabharat main yah kaha gaya he ki maanav jati kii praarambhik sthiti atyant pavitra swabhaav, dosharahit karm, satvaprakruti or ritu kii thi, jab na to kisi raja kii sthiti thi, na rajya tha, na dand tha, na dandi tha or sabhi log dharm ke dwaara hi ek duusare kii raksha karte the
 But over a period of time, the effect of tamasunas began to increase, human society became disenchanted with its primitive essence nature and fishery justice came into being
 balvan kamajoro ko khaane lage
 In such a situation, the kingdom and the king were born and a punishment was imposed to keep everyone on the right path
 dand rajya shakti kaa pratik hua jo sari prajaaon kaa shaasha, rakshak tathaa sabhi ke sote hue jaaganevaala tha
 Hence punishment was accepted as religion
 isse spasht prathit hota he ki dharm kaa sadhak keval dand hi mana gaya
 The religion which also contains meaning and work, that is, the seeker of Dandh Trivarga was accepted
 adarsh se skhalan ko dur karne ke liye dand kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Punishment as a state power began to circulate in the judicial arena
 uskaa uddeshy tha samaaj or dharm kii manyataon or yathasthiti kii raksha karnaa
 She was known as the status quo religion and there were many types of religion based on differences of caste, caste, ashram, country, time, group, class, family and occupation, etc
 used to have
 dand kaa prayog karanevaala raja bhi yadi dharm kaa ulanghan kare to dand kaa bhaagi hota tha
 There was no religion beyond religion, religion was also the king of kings
 rajya kaa pradhan raja athwa anya koi shakti, yatha ganatantr kaa mukhiya nyaayiky sanghathan kaa pradhan avashya tha, kintu vidhi kaa pradhan vah kabhi nahin ho sakaa or vidhi ke ulanghan karne par dand usapar bhi savaar ho jaataa tha
 This sovereignty of law and punishment in India appears to have developed from the Brahmanical period to the era of Manusmriti and Mahabharata
 aadhunik vidhishastri dand ke chaar siddhanth maanate hai -- The very early stage of society in all countries was symbolic punishment, in which the principle of tooth for eye and tooth for tooth was followed
 vaidic sahitya kii "jeevagrubh" jaisi sangyaayen is baat kii dyotak hen ki bhartiya itihaas ke atyant praarambhik kaal kaa nyaay kathor or pratikaratmak hi tha
 This theory holds that by punishing one criminal severely, other people are afraid of committing a crime
 nishedhaatmak siddhanth kii manyata he ki apradhi ko dand dene se jiske prati aparaadh hua he use uskaa 'badla' mil jaataa he
 This is the worst of all theories because it does not have the welfare of society or the sense of security of society
 teesri avasthaa main dand kaa swaroop pratikaratmak ke badale avarohak ho gaya
 The reason for this was to intervene in the kingdom holding the punishment instead of dealing with the guilty man
 vyaktigat badale kii bhaavana ko samaapt kar rajkeey dand kii mahima ko sthapit karnaa rajya kaa uddeshy or uski badhati hui shakti kaa dyotak ho gaya
 It was now impossible to get revenge in criminal cases, even though it was considered valid to get some revenge on a person convicted by imprisonment etc
 in civil cases
 kintu kathor - kabhi kabhi to atyant krur or asabhy dandon kaa diya janaa praayah niyam sa tha
 If we look at the punishments of the Upanishads, the punishments mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures, the recommendations of handcuffing by economics and its confirmations made by Megasthenes, or the punishments prevailing on both East and West up to the beginning of medieval and somewhat modern times
 If we think about it, we have to say that they were very cruel and barbaric in modern terms
 unka uddeshay tha auron main aparaadh karne ke prati bhay utpann karnaa
 These include mutilation, being burned alive, capital punishment, life imprisonment and punishments full of unbearable torture
 nirodhak dandon main aparaadh ke kaaran athwa uske bhavishya ke karta ko hi usase roak dene kaa upaay kiya jaataa he, jo uski vyaktigat swatantraaa chhinakar sampann hota he
 The Prevention of Jail Legislation of India is in this category
 chauthaa or sarvottam dand kaa prakaar he sudharatmak
 Even in the course of the development of civilization, although all countries have been subjected to severe obstructive punishments against potential culprits and to present fear of punishments, corrective tendencies have sometimes arisen
 pracheen rome main doshi kii swatantraaa kaa haran maatr hi sabase bada dand mana gaya or uske baad koi yatnaa aavashyak nahin samajhi gai 
 In India, Kautilya mentions the imprisonment to make atonement and to purify them by the system of making sense of their sins
 ashok ne bhi apane chaturth stambhalekh main vyavahaarasmta or dandsamta ke saath shuddhacharitra, dharmarat or sadvyavhaari doshiyon ke dandon ko kam karne kaa aadesh diya he
 These things are indicative of the corrective tendency of penal legislation
 smritiyon main dhigdand athwa vagdand kii charchaayen aati hai, jo sarvada kaaydand or vadhadand se pehle aata tha
 It meant that if the work goes on with just social condemnation, then what is the need of harsh torture? One rule was acceptable and that the punishment should be "as it is" and it should be given only when there is an offense
 20veen shatee main dandvidhaan ko sudharatmak swaroop dene ke praytn ho rahe hai
 In 1872, a meeting was held in London to decide an international form of international prison reform and punishment
 baad main tatsambandhi samuhik sanghatan bhi sthapit hue par uske sadsy adhikanshat: europea desh hi rahe
 Gradually, instead of harsh punishments, the moral life of the imprisoned convict was revived
 usamen bhay kii apeksha aashaa adhik rakhi jane lagi he
 In the corrective principle of punishment, it is legislated on the basis of the guilty status, social environment and situation
 dosha ke liye samaaj or vaataavaran ko bhi uttaradaayi mana jaataa he
 Therefore, the use of psychological measures to improve the guilty, its individual level consideration, the system of reforms for the guilty children, industrial education, general education, moral and religious discourse and other well-planned arrangements are made
 bharatvarsh main bhi kuch anya deshon kii tarah karagraston ko bandhanevaale baandhon, sadakon athwa anya nirmaanon main naukari or mazdooree karaane athwa audyogic shikshaaon ke dwaara samajopayogi or parivarasevi banane ke praytn prarambh hai
 It is not impossible that kidnapping of personal liberty should be considered as the greatest punishment in a few centuries and human nature should become so sublime and sacred that punishments like life imprisonment and life imprisonment are not required
 kabul nadi ek 700 kimi lambi nadi he jo afghanistan main hindu kush parvaton kii sanglakh shrunkhlaa se shuru hokar pakistan ke atak shahar ke paas sindhu nadi main vilay ho jaati he

 Several dams are built on the Kabul River

 The Varsak Dam, located 20 km northwest of Peshawar in Pakistan, is also a major dam built on it

 This river was called 'kubha' in Sanskrit and ancient Avastai language which later changed to 'kabul'

 It has been said in this subject that - pracheen unani itihaaskaar aariyaan ne apane 'sikandar mahaan kaa abhiyaan or iran par qabze kaa itihaas' naamak itihaas-granth main kabul nadi ko 'kofen' kaa naam diya tha
 On the basis of this, other European writers also started calling this river by the name 'koface'
 arab lekhak al beruni ne kabul nadi ko 'gorvand kii nadi' bulaayaa tha

 The area mentioned by the name of Manas Khand in the Manas Khand and other mythological literature of Skanda Purana is the present Kumaon Mandal
 is kshetra main bhi anek pracheen mandir or tirth sthal hai
 Several dialects are spoken in the Kumaon region
 kuch mukhya sthaneey bhashaaain is prakaar hai:- Various opinions have been prevalent regarding the derivation of the word Kumaon
 bhashaa kii drushti se yahi uchit jaan padataa he ki yah shabd multah sanskrit main kurm he
 There is a 2196 meter high Kanteshwar mountain near Champawat in respect of which Lord Vishnu in his second incarnation stayed on this mountain for three years
 tab se vah parvat kanteshwar ke sthaan par kurm-anchal naam se janaa jane laga
 The shape of this mountain also looks like the back of a tortoise
 sambhavtah isi kaaran is kshetra kaa naam kurmanchal padaa hoga
 At first the word Kurma may have come into use, because the word Kurm is found in abundance in the local language
 kurm ke sthaan par kumuun shabd nishpann hone kaa ek kaaran yah bhi ho saktaa he ki yahan kii boliyon main ukaarantata adhik pai jaati he
 Later, in the literary texts, copper letters, the word Kuma was replaced by Kumaon and then the word Kumaon was accepted
 sanskrit granthon main bhi kurmanchal shabd kaa prayog miltaa he
 In the absence of authentic historical facts, it is difficult to say with certainty which human castes were originally dominated in the Kumaon region
 mahabharat, puraana or pracheen sanskrit sahitya main uplabdh katipay sandarbhon se gyaat hota he ki yahan kiraat, kinnar, yaksha, tangav, kulind, khas ityadi jatiyaan nivas karti thim
 In the forest festival of Mahabharata, the castes residing in the uplands of the central Himalayas have been described as Kirat, Tangava and Kulint
 kiraantathanganakeern kulind shat sankulam
 Enumerating the names of those present in Yudhishthira's rajasuya-yajna, Duryodhana states that the mountainous king named khas-ekasan, Parada, Kulind, Tangava and Paratangana, residing on the banks of the Shailoksha River in the middle of the Meru temple mountains are black colored chambers and gold of Pipilika caste
 Had brought dronparv main aayaa he ki ukt parvatiy jatiyon ne pathar ke hathiyaaron se mahabharat kii ladaai main duryodhana kii ore se bhaag lekar krishna ke sarathi saatyaki par chaaron ore se patharav kiya tha, kintu saatyaki ke naraachon ke samaksh ve na tik sake
 The Brahmapurana and the Vayupurana provide signs of the existence of castes like Kirat, Kinnar, Yaksha, Gandharva, Vidyadhar, Nag, etc
 in the central Himalayas

 Kalidasa's "ka" Yaksha tells Meghha to mark the identity of Alkapuri, saying that his Priya must have spread flowers on the door of his door over the conceptions of shankha-padma
 dwarapante likhit vapushon shankhapadmau c drushtva tathaa vinyasyanti bhuvigananaya dehalidant pushpai : In various aspects of cultural life, this practice is still present on the occasion of various festivals in Kumaon
 yaksha jati ke alaava aadi yug main kumaanun main naag jati ke nivas ke sanket bhi milte hai
 There is a famous temple of Binag / Beninag in a place called Berinag in Pithoragarh district
 naagon ke naam par kumaanun main or bhi kai mandir he
 Such as Dhaulnag, Kalinag, Pingalnag, Kharhrynag, Basuki Nag, Nagdev etc
 kumaun kii aadim jatiyon main yaksha or naag jati ke astitv kii kalpana anumaanon par aadhaarit he kintu kiraat jati ke sambadh main kuch samaaj shastreey evam nrivaigyanik pramaanon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki pragaitihaasik yug main kumaanun-gadhwal ke bhu-bhaag kiraat, mongol aadi aryetar jatiyon ke nivas kshetra rahe, jinhen kaalaantar main uttar-pashchim kii ore se aane vaale avaidic khas aaryon ne vijit kar liya
 It is also likely that the Munda-speaking Kirat caste of the Agni family dominated the region for a long time, otherwise it would not have been known as Kiratamandal in ancient times
 apane swatantra bhashaai astitv ke saath kiraaton ke vanshaj aaj bhi kumaun ke askot evam didihat naamak sthanon main maujuud hai
 In Kumaon dialects, many such words are still prevalent, which seem to be the remnants of the prehistoric dialects, such as Dhud, Lydun, Jung, Jhungar, Phang, Thanghar, Ganga, Lyat etc
 In addition to vocabulary, certain grammatical elements are also ignorant
 The languages of the family are similar, such as kumuni karma causative indicator kani / kan suffixes of Munda's Bhoveasi and Kork earrings have k / kin or khe / khin
 bees ke samooh ke aadhaar par ginaney kii paddati raji or kumaunni main samaan rup se milti he
 Kumiuni is the word Bisi for a group of twenty
 kiraat jati ke alaava kumaanun kshetra main himalay ke uttaranchal main nivas karne vaali bhotiya jati kaa bhi prabhutv rahaa
 The word Bhotia is basically Boat or Bhot
 tibet ko bhot desh yaa bhutan bhi kaha jaataa he tathaa us desh se sambandhit hone ke kaaran vahaan ke nivaasiyon ko bhotiya kaha gaya
 The language of the Bhotis was called Tibetan
 yah tibeti se nikatataa rakhti he
 Local differences are found in the language of Johor Darma, Beans and Chaudans
 bhotiyon kii boli johari par kumaunni kaa prabhaav spasht parilakshith hota he
 On this basis, it can be said that before the arrival of the Aryans, people who spoke the language of Munda and Tibetan family must have resided here
 kumaanun main shaq sanwat ke prachlan evam almoda main kosi ke sameep sthit kataarmal surya mandir ke astitv se is sambhaavna kii pushti hoti he ki kiraat, raji, naag ityadi aadim jatiyon ke pashchaat yahan shaq jati kaa astitv rahaa he
 On the basis of the names of folk deities like Gadnath, Jagannath, Bholanath etc
, and the names of Gannath etc
, the possibility of existence of Nath caste can also be expressed here
 itnaa nirvivaad he ki kumaun ke aadi nivasee kol, kiraat, raji naag, hun, shaq, bor, tharu, boksa, bhotiya or khas jati ke log hai
 The most powerful of these was the Khas, who came to Kumaon after other castes
 yahaan bhashaa or samskruti kii aadhaar bhoomi ke nirmaan main bhi khason kaa yogadan rahaa he
 Originally belonging to the Aryan caste, before the creation of the Khas Rigveda, they would have separated from their original Aryan brothers and moved in separate parties from Central Asia towards the east
 yahi kaaran he ki ve avaidic arya bhi kehalaate hai
 It is estimated that they were in BC
 Around the second millennium AD spread from west to east in different parts of India

 kumaun main aaj bhi yah prachlit he ki katyuri vansh ke avsaan par surya chhip gaya or raatri ho gai, kintu chandravanshi chandramaa ke udai se andhkaar mit gaya
 New light spread over the establishment of Chandravanshi rule
 ‘ When the power of the last kings of the Katyuri dynasty weakened, small states became independent, and they united and expanded their kingdom
 sampoorn kumaun main koi ek shakti na thi, jo sabko apane adheen kar paati
 During this Sankranti period, the kingdom was shattered and the development works started by the Katyuri kings either ended or their form changed
 katyur vansh ke antim shaskaon ne praja par atyadhik atyaachaar bhi kiye
 In the same tradition, even during this Sankranti period, the local small kings also persecuted the people very much, but the shana-shanai Chandravanshi kings laid the foundation of their unbroken kingdom

 According to Badridatta Pandey, the first king of the Chandravansh, Somchand sat on the throne around 700 AD
 chandravanshi raajaaon ke kumaun main aane kaa kaaran bhi spasht nahin he
 According to scholars, after the end of Katyuri rule, the people, saddened by the atrocities of the native kings, went to King Somchand of Kannauj and invited him to establish peace in Kumaon

 Thus the Chandravansha was established in Kumaon

 By the time of King Mahendra Chand, the Chand kings had full authority over the entire Kumaon

 At the same time, many Brahmin castes from Kannauj etc
 came to settle in Kumaon and along with them untouchability, differences in food, varna tradition and differences of caste gotra related to marriage also became prevalent among the original inhabitants, which is still in Kumaon today
