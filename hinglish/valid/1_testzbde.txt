 aajkal hindi main 'devtaa' shabd kaa dev shabd ke samaan pulling main vyavhaar hota he
 In feminine both forms are goddesses
 indra, rudra, ganesh aadi devtaa; shachi, durga, lakshmi aadi deviyaan hai
 There are many classes like Gandharva, Apsara, Yaksha, Pitru and Deva of the subtle bodily beings and those residing in the regions above the earth
 inamen devvarg sabase unchaa he or uskaa nivas swarglok main mana jaataa he
 There is also a synonym of Dev
 aryasamaj ke vidvan aisa nahin maanate
 He believes that the word Dev has been used in Vedic poetry for scholars and ascetics, generally revered people
 sambhav he aisa hi ho, parantu saadhaaran: hinduon ke vishwaason ke anusaar aisa nahin he
 Many mantras do not have the meaning of assuming the word Dev to be present by the scholars present, such as: devon ne yajyapurush kii yajna ke dwaara puja kii, un dharmon ke dwaara jo is vishwa ke sanchaalak aadi dharm hai
 Those who behave in this way get glory in their nostrils where the earlier Sadhya Dev resides
 isamen koi andeh nahin he
 Gods and Gods have become synonymous with each other in some way, yet there is some difference in behavior
 'ek devtaa' kaha ja saktaa he parantu ek dev bolne kaa chalan nahin he
 Devlok, Devgan etc
 can be spoken
 dev, devtaa, devi ke virdohi asur, daitya, daanav jaise naamon se pukaare jate hai
 In Sanskrit, God and God are not synonymous
 pahili baat jo apni ore dhyaan aakrisht karti he vah yah he ki devtaa shabd streeling he or duusari yah ki uskaa prayog mantron ke hi sambandh main hota he
 If in a Sanskrit book, the deity has been written in the sense of the deity, then in my understanding it should be known as the author's demeanor, although many lexicographers also consider the two words to be synonyms
 kai pratishthit pustakon main bhi aisa prayog aata he par in sab kii rachana vedakaal se peeche kii he
 Each Vedamantra is accompanied by a mention of his seer and sage and his appropriation and also the name of a deity
 devtaa kaa naam praaia: pulling main hota he, jaise: Vishnu walked, he laid feet three times, the whole world was filled with dust from his feet
 is mantra ke saath devtaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 But because of the femininity of the word deity, one would say that 'the deity of this mantra is Vishnu
 isi prakaar kisi mantra kii devtaa, indra, kisi kii rudra aadi hai
 This seems strange
 yahi parampara tantragranthon main chali ai he
 They also have many mantras
 koi mantra ek akshar kaa hota he, koi anekakshar, jaise hrin yaa clin, uun van vajraay swaha yaa ein hrin clin chamundaai viche swaha
 Each mantra is mentioned with its deity
 yah vichaarneey he ki mantra ke saath purush dev ke liye streeling devtaa shabd kyon prayukt hota he
 There is serious spiritual thought behind this mystery
 vishwa kaa aadhaar to shuddh brahm he
 He is Sattarupa, Chinmaya
 jagat ke aarambh main vahiin padaarth paramatma rup se sthit hota he
 God is Parasaktiyukt
 paramshiv ke do chehre saamne aate hai : prakaash or vimarsh, shiv or shakti
 Both are one, integral
 nasadeey sookt kahata he: 'aanidwatam swadhaya tadekam, tasamdhanyannahi kihenaaye' - He was breathing without air with his selfishness, there was nothing but him
 isiilie is tatv kaa pratik ardhanarishwar vigrah he
 As the world becomes more and more grander, there are innumerable forms of power
 inamen se prayek ko devtaa kehete hai
 All the divisions of science that study energy are all deities
 devataayen to anant hai, ham unamem se kuch ko naam dete hai
 It is believed that if the chanting of a particular mantra is chanted properly, the linguistic sounds generated by the utterance excite the Anantasagar of Shakti in a special way
 falat: sadhak main vishesh prakaar kii shakti kaa udai hota he
 If it is said that the deity of so-and-so mantra is Rudra, it means that the chanting of that mantra methodically will enlighten the seeker in the seeker - the rise of destructive power
 yah sadhak kii nishtha or tap kii ugrata par nirbhar karata he ki vah shakti sagar ko kahan tak vilodit kar sakegaa
 Similarly, the names Vishnu, Prajapati, Indra etc
 are used with mantras as a symbol of Vaishnavi, Brahmi, and Andri Shakti
 sab devataaon ko mahashakti se tadatmya durgasaptshati main is prakaar dikhalaayaa gaya he
 Seeing Lakshmi, Brahmani etc
 coming to help Mahasaraswati in fighting Shumbha, the Goddess says that all these are my personalities, 'mamapara of Dwitiya - Who is there other than me? And immediately all the gods devolved into him
 devgan koun hai? yah log purakaal ke yogi hai jinhone apane ugr tap ke bal par vishwa main unchaa sthaan paaya he
 The person who has a special sense of power is called by his name
 yah log deergh kaal tak itar jeevon ke kalyanarth apni vibhootiyon kaa upyog karte rahete hai
 From this it is clear that Dev and Devata do not have the same meaning
 yah kah sakate hai ki devatayukta vyakti dev he
 Incidentally, it should also be considered why the meaning of devolution has taken place and why the practice of the word Dev has reduced
 jab tak vaidic yajna yag hote rahe veda kaa adhyayan adhyaapan bhi hota rahaa
 After the Buddhist period, the practice of Yajnas became very less, the Vedas appeared to be purposeless
 falat: mantron ke arth kii ore se dhyaan hat gaya, devtaa shabd kaa lakshya vismritpraaya ho gaya
 The name Indradi was already given as a symbol of the gods
 devtaa shabd ke streeling hone kii ore se bhi dhyaan dur ho gaya
 The symbol became the original
 indradev, vishnudev, varunadev, indradevataa, vishnudevataa, varunadevataa ban gaye
 Historians say that at some time there was a struggle among the Aryans over any religious question
 yah aaj se sahastron varsh pehle kii baat he
 We do not know all the questions on which the dispute arose but it seems certain that one question was in relation to Indra
 kuch log indra ko devraj maanate the
 The rest were not ready for this
 jhagada itnaa badha ki indra ko na maananevaale desh kaa chhodkar chale gaye
 While wandering in many places, they finally settled in Iran
 unheen ke vanshaj aaj parsiyon ke naam se hamaare desh main rahete hai
 In the Vedas, those who disobey Indra, Anindra, are greatly condemned
 dharmik katutaa kaa parinaam yahan tak pahunchaa ki dharm sambandhi kuch mahatvapurn shabdon tak kaa bantwaaraa ho gaya
 Two of these words were Dev and Asura
 dev shabd div dhaatu se niklaa he, jiskaa arth he chamakna
 The one who is bright, bright, is a god
 asur kii vyutpatti sayan ke anusaar is prakaar he : asyati kshipati sarvan - jo sabko phenk detaa he
 He has given its meaning to Prabel: strong
 prarambh main in donon shabdon kaa vaacharth ek hi tha
 Gods were also brilliant and powerful, so he was also an Asura
 is pracheen prayog kii smritiyaan swayan veda main surakshit hai
 Devas have been called asuras in many places
 rugveda ke tritiy mandal ke 55wein sookt main 22 mantra hai
 There is a discussion about the insecurity of the Gods
 prayek mantra ke ant main kaha gaya he : mahaddevanamsuratvamekan devon kaa asuratv mahan he arthath vah bade prabal hai
 Take for example the 10th mantra of Sukta: - rakshak vishnu param path se jate hai, priy amrit dhaamon ko dhaaran karte hue
 Agni knows all those shrines, devon kaa ek asuratv mahan he
 
 dharmik khatpat main ye donon shabd bant gaye
 The Iranian Aryans adopted the word Asura and the Indians adopted the word Dev
 iran main paramatma ahurmajd- asur mahat- bada asur- kahalaaya to bharat main use mahadev kii oopaadhi mili
 As a result, Dev became slanderous in the Iranian community and the same misery in Indians was the word Asura
 logon ke musalmaan ho jane par bhi dev shabd irani bhashaa, farsi main upar na uth sakaa, usee bhoot pret, nikrusht or dusht parantu shaktishaalee, jeevvishesh ke arth main prayog hota rahaa
 Pathan came to India with aggressors
 ab ek to yahan purana dev shabd tha, doosraa yah nayaa dev shabd pahunchaa
 The word Swadeshi had to retreat in front of the aggressor
 dhire dhire uskaa vyavhaar kam hota gaya
 Scholars may have done this intentionally deliberately to save fornication
 uske paas devtaa shabd tha hi jiskaa ab praaia: koi pruthak prayojan nahin rah gaya tha
 God was gradually replaced by Dev and for his evil meaning the word Dev came down in the dialect of ordinary people
 kaladev, laldev aadi kii kahaniyaan lok main prachlit ho gayi, amuk manushya kaa dev jaisaa sharir he, aise vaakya sune jane lage
 While Apsara, Gandharva etc
 were there, we saw the creation of new classes of gin, pari and devas during the Muslim rule
 sau varsh puraane naatak amanatakrut inder sabha main inamen se kaiyon ke darshan hote hai
 There, in the court of King Inder, fairies instead of Apsaras and colored gods like Agni, Varuna, Vishnu etc
 come on the stage
 prasangvshaat 'sur' shabd kaa bhi upar charchaa kiya gaya he
 Its history also seems interesting
 vaidic vaanmay main iskaa pataa nahin chalaa
 It seems that by forgetting the etymology of the word Asura from behind, people would have thought that this word was formed by getting a and Sur
 aisi avasthaa main iskaa arth hoga sur nahin
 The voice which was not there, became asura
 asuron ke virdohi dev the hi, at: sur sahaj hi dev kaa paryaay ban gaya
 The etymology for this was also traced: Sushthu Rati Abhishtanja gives well to the intended, fulfills
 nayaa hote hue bhi yah shabd saikadon varshon se prachlit he
 Rio de Janeiro is the capital of Rio de Janeiro state of Brazil and the second largest city in the country
 yah shahar dakshin america kaa teesraa sabase adhik jansankhya vaala shahar he

 The rover will weigh between 20-30 kg and will be powered by solar energy
 The rover will move on the surface of the moon with wheels, collect samples of soil and rocks, analyze them chemically and send the data up to the orbiter from where it will be sent to the station of the Earth
 praarambhik yojana main rover ko rus main dizin or bharat main nirmit kiya janaa tha
 However, Russia refused to design the rover in May 2010
 iske baad, isro ne rover ke dizin or nirmaan khud karne kaa faisla kiya
 IIT Kanpur developed three subsystems of Rover to provide mobility: isro ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ek visheshgy samiti ke nirnay ke anusaar orbitor par paanch tathaa rover par do pelod bheje jaayenge
 haalanki shuruyaat main bataaya gaya tha ki nasa tathaa iese bhi is abhiyaan main bhaag lenge or orbitor ke liye kuch vaigyanik upkarnon ko pradaan karenge, isro ne baad main spasht kiya ki vajan pratibandhon ke chalate vah is abhiyaan par kisi bhi gaiyr-bhartiya pelod ko saath nahin le jaayegi

 But in these formulas, the name of Badarayana has been quoted and his opinion is cited, so some people do not consider it as a work of Badrayana and it is called the work of a later collector

 iske rachayita maharishi jaimini hai
 It is also known as Purimansutra
 iskaa rachanakaal 300 isapurv se 200 isapurv mana jaataa he
 Mimamsutra is the basic text of Mimamsa philosophy
 pramparanusaar rishi jaimini ko maharishi veda vyas kaa shishy mana jaataa he
 Mimamsasutra is also called 'purva Mimamsa' and Vedanta's 'uttara Mimamsa'
 purmamimasaa main dharm kaa vichaar he ar uttarmimasaa main brahm kaa
 Therefore, the Dharmamimamsa of the East and the North, and the north-east is also called the Brahmanimansa
 jaimini muni dwaara rachit sutara hane se mimasaa kaa 'jaimineey dharmamimasaa' kaha jaataa he
 The Yajnaic utterances of the Vedas have been interpreted with great thought in the foregoing
 mimasaa shaastra main yagyon kaa vistrut vivechan he, isse ise 'yajnvidya' bhi kehete hai 
 Being divided into twelve chapters, this epistemology is also called 'dwadashalshi'
 is shaastra kaa 'purvamimasaa' naam is abhipraay se nahin rakhaa gaya he ki yah uttarmimasaa se pehle bana
 To say 'east' means that ritual is the first religion of man, the right to knowledge comes after him
 'mimasaa' shabd kaa arth 'jigyaasa' he
 Curiosity, meaning the longing to know
 manushya jab is sansar main avatarit hua uski pratham jigyaasa yahi rahi thi ki vah kya kare? granth kaa armbh hi mahirsh jaimini is prakaar karte hai- Therefore, the first formula of this philosophy is a symbol of this desire of man
 is granth main gyaan-uplabdhi ke jin chah sadhano kii charchaa kii gai he, ve he- pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan, shabd, arthapatti or anuplabdhi
 According to the philosophy of Mimamsa, Veda is unconquerable, continual and supreme and Veda-propounded meaning is called Dharma
 iske duusare sutara main kaha gaya he- The theory of epistemology is unique
 isaki gananaa anishvaravaadi darshanon main he
 Spirit, Brahma, Jagat etc
 are not discussed in this
 yah keval veda vaa uske shabd kii nityata kaa hi pratipaadan karata he
 According to this, mantras are everything
 ve hi devtaa hai; devataaon kii alag koi satta nahin
 In 'bhattadipika' it is clearly said that the word 'mere deity'
 mimasakon kaa tark yah he ki sab karmfal ke uddeshy se hote hai
 Fruits are achieved by karma, so they say that apart from the words of karma and its proponents, what is the need to obey a god or god from above
 mimasakon or naiyayikon main bada baari bhed yah he ki mimasak shabd ko nity maanate hai or naiyayik anitya 
 Both Sankhya and Mimamsa are atheistic, but both recognize the authenticity of the Veda
 bhed itnaa hi he ki sankhya prayek kalp main veda kaa naveen prakaashan maanata he or mimasak use nity arthath kalpant main bhi nasht na honevaala kehete hai
 The Mimamsa philosophy is of 16 chapters, with 12 chapters in order
 shastrasangati, adhyaysangati, padasngati or adhikarasangatiyon se susambaddha he
 What is left in these twelve chapters is represented in the remaining four chapters, which is famous as 'sankarshakand'
 usamen devtaa ke adhikaar kaa vivechan kiya gaya he, at: use 'devtaa kand' bhi kehete hai athwa dwadash adhyyon kaa parishisht bhi kah sakate hai
 Bhaskar Rai Dixit has written at the end of the interpretation of the Sankarshan Kand that despite the Shodasadhyayi Mimamsa, Dwadasadhyay used to have a reading in the Middle Ages
 is darshan ke prathamadhyay main dharmapramaanon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he or vidhi, arthwaad mantra, smriti, shishtachar, namadhey, sandigdharth nirnaayak vaakyashesh or samarthy kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 In Dwitiyadhyaya, word, practice, number, noun, property and case, these six deeds are proof of distinction
 tritiyadhyaay main shruti, ling, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan or samakhya ye chha: viniojak pramaan hai
 In Chaturvadhyaya, there are six explanatory proofs in Shruti Artha, recitation, place, main and propensity
 panchmaadhyay main atidesh, pratyakshvachanaatidesh, namatidesh, kalpit vachanaatidesh, ashrayatidesh or sthanpatti atidesh ye saat prakaar ke atidesh hai
 The two distinctions of the end are not mentioned in Saptamadhyaya
 ye indriya kamadhikaran tathaa sthanpatti atidesh main nirupit hai
 In the sixth chapter, there is a decision on the right of the performers and performers of yagyas
 saatven or aathven main ek yajna kii vidhi ko duusare yajna main karne kaa varnan he
 The eighth chapter describes the method of performing a yajna in another yajna
 navam adhyay main teen prakaar ke "ooh" kaa nirupan he 
 There are representations of three types of 'baadha' in Dasamadhyay
 ekadshadhyay main tantra or aavaay kaa nirupan he
 Dwadasadhyaya has a representation of "context"
 is prakaar ek-ek vishay kaa pratipaadan dwadashadhyaayaatmak mimasaa darshan main kiya gaya he jise "dwadashalakshani" bhi kaha gaya he
 Here the word 'symptom' is epistemological
 isko do prakaar se vibhakt kiya gaya he jise upadesh or atidesh kehete hai
 Preaching is discussed in the first chapters
 dwitiya ke chah adhyyon main atidesh kaa vivechan he
 The above preaching is the overarching doctrine
 shaastra deepikacar parthasarathi mishra ke anusaar upadesh vichaar ke ananthar atidesh vichaar kaa aarambh hota he
 There are two chapters in present-day epistemology philosophy
 prayek adhyay main chaar paad hote hai, kintu tritiy, shashth or dasham adhyyon main aath aath paad hai, jise "shabra" adhyay bhi kehete hai
 In this way there are sixty feet in the whole book
 is darshan kii sutarasankhya main vivaad he
 In someone's opinion, two thousand six hundred fifty two, in another opinion two thousand seven hundred forty two sutras
 uparyukt varnan "aesekit" kii "karmmimasaa" naamak pustak prishth chaar main pratipaadit he
 "nyayamala", published from Anand Ashram Poona, has two thousand and forty five sutras
 isi prakaar kuch vyaktiyon ke mat se adhikaran sankhya nau sau saat praapt hoti he
 Some have nine hundred and fifteen sutras
 kintu "mimasasar sangrah" ke karta shankar bhatta ke anusaar "purvashatk" main paanch sau tees, uttardatk main chaar sau sattar sutara hai
 Thus the entire tribunal is divided into a thousand numbers
 uparyukt shloke ke anusaar adhikranon kii sankhya ek sahasr do sau pachaas he
 In Mimamsa, each Tribunal has five parts - Subject, Doubt, Antecedent, Antitrust and Principle
 atah sutron ko samajhane ke ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak hota he ki koi sutara in paanchon main se kiskaa pratipadak he
 In this scripture, very precise rules and tips have been given to find out the meaning of sentence, episode, theme or scripture
 mimasakon kaa yah shloke saamanytah taatparynirnay ke liye prasiddh hai— That is, in order to determine the meaning of a scripture or an episode, seven things must be considered — undertaking, epilogue, practice, singularity, fruit, economism, and subsistence
 mimasak aise hi niyamon ke dwaara veda ke vachanon kaa taatpary nikaalte hai
 The semantics have also been decided thoughtfully
 jaise, yajna ke liye jahaan 'sahasr sanvatsar' ho, vahaan 'sanvatsar' kaa arth diwas lenaa chahie, ityadi
 Epistemology is the exponent of rituals; Hence Mimansak Pourusheya, Apoorusheya consider all sentences to be functional
 ve kehete hai ki prayek vaakya kisi vyapaar yaa karm kaa bodhak hota he, jiskaa koi fal hota he
 Therefore, in relation to something, they consider it very important to decide whether it is a 'law sentence' or just economism
 jaise, "rankshetra main jaao, vahaan swarg rakhaa he"
 There are two sections of this sentence - 'go to battlefield', this is a rhetoric or main statement, and 'there is heaven', it is only economism or secondary matter
 iske sutara jaimini ke hai or bhashya shabar swami kaa he
 Kumaril Bhatt's 'kantantravartik' and 'shlokavartik' are also famous on Mimamsutra
 madhavacharya ne bhi 'jaimineey nyaayamala vistaar' naamak ek bhashya rachaa he

 Elevated vocals, generally female, began to become more prevalent, increasing the popular attraction of trance
 behad lokapriy trns ne khud ko house se zyaada 'tikshn' sthaan ko praapt karte paaya, jo drum or baas kii tulana main adhik sukhad or techno se zyaada madhur tha, jisase vah vyapak rup se darshakon tak pahunchaa
 Artists such as Paul van Dyk, Armin van Buuren, Tiësto, Robert Miles, Above and Beyond, Darren Tait, Ferry Korsten, Johann Jielen, ATB, Paul Oakenfold, Pulsar, and Third Element emerged as leading producers, remixers, and sentimentalists Presented the "epic" style experience

 By the late 1990s, trance had become commercially huge, but it was fragmented in a very different style
 1990 dashak ke prarambh or madhya main kuch kalakaar, jinhone trns dhwani kii rachana main vishesh madad kii thi, dashak ke ant tak trns ko bhumigat dhwani ke paksh main puri tarah chhod diya - vishesh rup se in kalakaaron main shaamil hai pascal F

 or oliver lieb
 As an alternative development, some artists attempted to mix trance with other genres such as drum'n'bass
 kuch anya kalakaaron ne atyant sookshm dhvaniyon ke saath prayog kiya
 Disappointed, exaggerated versions of trance were combined via tweet in the borderline genre of "hard trance" or "hard style", a cross-link between hardcore and terracore
 apni jadon ke prati adhik vafaadaar trns ne internet par apana sir uthaanaa shuru kiya, jahaan kanoonee music downlod citon kii bharmaar he - jisamen shaamil hai juno downlod or betaport - jo utsaahi shrotaaon ko mp3 or anacompresd wavs ko downlod karte hue, mushkil se milane vaale vinil kii khoj main pareshaan na hone diya, jinhen saptahik aadhaar par adhyatan kiya jaataa he
 As a result, both commercial and progressive trance have now become more worldwide, at least if not chart-bound, at least Sasha, Tiësto, ATB, Marcus Schulz, Armin van Vuuren, BT, Paul van Dyk, Ferry Courtenay, Above and Beyond, Blue Stone is able to maintain its honorable positions with attractive artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Schiller, Solarstoman and America's Christopher Lawrence and George Acosta While upcoming producers and DJ can also breakthrough into the public domain
 aam taur par trns 4 / 4 time signechar main 130 se 155 BPM kii gati, 32 bit vaakyansh main kaary karata he or kuch-kuch grih sangeet se tivratar hota he lekin aamtaur par cicedelik trns kii tarah tej nahin hota
 Periodically the trance can sometimes be fast and sometimes slow
 ek kik drum ko prayek downbit par rakhaa jaataa he or ek niyamit khule haai-het ko aksar apbit par rakhaa jaataa he
 In addition, some simple additional rhythmic elements are commonly added and often major transitions, constructions or climaxes are covered by long snare rolls - an intermittent beat similar to a snare drum creating a volume at the end of a phrase or phrase
 laghu pizikato tatv or lambe sweeping string dhwani, donon ke liye saral sotooth-aadhaarit dhwani adhikansh trns treks ke kendriya tatv synthesisers rup kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 As important as other genres of electronic music are the synthesizers Roland TR-808 and TR-909 TB-303, the source of the "acid" sound
 isamen or bhi kai synthesizer dhwani hote hai jo lagbhag puri tarah se apni style ke liye adwitiya hai
 One of these sounds is the sound "superso", a waveform created by classic trance synthesizers known as the Roland JP-8000, the Novation Supernova, and the Korg MS2000
 ek takanic jise "gating" kaha jaataa he, aksar agrani dhwani kaa nirmaan karata he teji se arpegiyo or chote anupaat isaki aam visheshtaayen hai

 haalanki aise kai treks hai jisamen geet shaamil nahin hote, jabaki anya treks geet par hi nirbhar hote hai or is tarah ek up-style kaa vikaas hota he
 The quality of sound and production is dependent to a high degree on the technology available
 mul trns dhwani pallate main mung, rolland or overhem jaise naam ke saath vishisht analog upkaran kai nirmaataaon evam samarthakon ke dilon main abhi bhi sthaan banaae hue he
 However the availability of mainstream digital technology allows a whole new set of manufacturers to emerge as top shelf digital synthesizers are valued at thousands of US dollars and are in great demand and the reason they are very expensive due to clean older analog synthesizers it happens
 trns record aksar reverv ke saath baari hote hai or synthesisers dhwani, geet or takaraav anubhaagon ke aksar bahudhaa bhaagon par deree se prabhaav daalate hai
 It provides trance makers with a sense of spacious space to trend towards achieving quality of style
 charam setting main flangers, fesers or anya prabhaav kaa bhi saamanytah prayog kiya jaataa - trns main kisi vaastavik vishwa ke baajon ke samaan kisi dhwani kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, isiilie nirmaataa ke paas swatantra bagdor hoti he
 As with most dance music tracks, the beginning and end of trance tracks are usually sparse so that djs can mix them quite easily
 The "build up, strip down" arrangement of the record during the beginning and end is called "DJ Friend"
 chunki adhikansh nrity sangeet kii tulana main trns adhik madhur or hormonic hota he isiilie djs dwaara asangat mishran, jo swar sangati dwaara mishran nahin karata, se bachane ke liye iskaa nirmaan usee prakaar kiya janaa atyant mahatvapurn hota he
 
 trns sangeet kai prakaar kii shaileyon main vibhajit he
 The major genres in chronological order are classic trance, acid trance, progressive trance and uplifting trance
 aplifting trns ko "anthem trns", "apik trus", "stadium trans" yaa "euforic trns" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Very close to uplifting trance is Euro-trance, which has become a general term for a wide variety of highly commercialized European dance music
 electronic sangeet ke anya pramukh shaileyon ke saath kai shaileyon ke vikaas kii prakriya he
 Take trance, for example, is a mixture of trance and techno, vocal trance and the pop-like structure of songs, and ambient trance is a mixture of ambient and trance

 The state of Mysore was the state of present-day Karnataka
 mysore rajya main chakiyaan krishnaray naam ke shaasha kaa rajya tha jo ki vodiar vansh se tha
 In Mysore, there were two officials Nannaraj and Devaraja during the time of Chakki Krishnarai
 inhone raja ko apane vash main kar rakhaa tha or prashasan ko apane tareeke se chalaate the
 At the same time, Haider Ali was born in 1721 AD and admitted to work at Horsala

 Thus began the First Mysore War

 Kalil or colloid is a chemical mixture in which one object is uniformly dispersed in another
 parikshepit vastu ke kan mishran me keval nilambit rahete he naa ki ek vilyan kii tarah 
 This is because the size of the particles in the membrane is larger than the size of the particles present in the solution - these particles are so small that they are completely dispersed in the mixture to form a homogenous mixture, but not so large that the light Scour and do not dissolve
 is parikshepan ke chalate kuch kalil vilyan jaise dikhte hai
 a bud system has two distinct phases: the first dispersion phase and the second continuous phase
 ek kalil pranali thos, drav yaa gasiy ho sakati he
 The table below gives a comparative analysis of the diameter of the particles of the plume in a homogenous and uniform mixture
 : Therefore, the collicular suspensions are intermediates for homogenous and homogeneous mixtures
 kalil ke liye angreji main kollid shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The word is derived from the Greek word kola which means 'glue'

 main ek angrej vaigyanik, tamas graham, ne dekha ki albumin, sares, gond, maand, silisik amla or isi prakaar ke anya padaarth jal main ghole jane par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se chhanakar nahin nikal pate
 In contrast, hydrolysis of sugars, urea, sodium, chloride, etc
 are released from the pores of the bio-membrane
 purv prakaar ke padaarth adhikansh main acristalia rup main milte hai is gun ke aadhaar par jal main viley padaartho kaa do virgon main vibhaajan kiya gaya: ek ve padaarth, jo crystalia the or jal main vilyan ke pashchaat jaev jhilli ke chhidron se bahirgat ho sakate the, crystalloid kehalaae or duusare ve, jo acristalia the or jal main gholne par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikalne main samarth nahin ho sakate the, kalil kehalaae
 But now it has been proved that crystalline substances like sugars and sodium chloride can also be obtained in the appropriate medium in the form of pigments
 kalilavastha main kalil kan ek avichhinn madhyam main bikhare rahete hai
 Thus, there are two components in the buds

 The solids of the solid or liquid distributed in the medium of water are called Sauls
 carbonic or acarbonic donon prakaar ke padaarth anek roopon main kalilavastha main paae jate hai
 Scientifically or technically, there is hardly any branch in which the buds are not used significantly
 apni isimhatta ke kaaran kalil vigyaan vishesh rup se hota gaya he
 In order to distinguish between the qualities of the Kalils, they have been divided into two major classes
 pehle varg main dhatviya prakaar ke kalil, jaise swarna kalil aadi, hai or duusare varg main protein prakaar ke kalil hai, jaise gelatin aadi
 Their special qualities are as follows: in donon prakaar ke kalilon ke liye jin shabdon kaa vishesh prayog hota he ve hai jalasantrasi or jalpremi 
 They are also called lyophobic and lyophilic in English in order
 yah vargeekaran purnroopen santoshjanak nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki katipay kalilon ke kuch gun donon charam virgon ke apokshakrit gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 These types of waterways have some metal oxides or hydroxides, some insoluble phosphate, molybdate, tungstate etc
 kuch log kalilon ko alambaabh or pysabh ke do virgon main vibhajit karte hai
 Apart from these, there is also a third category of Kalils which has become particularly important now
 yah varg kalileey vidyudvishleshya kehalaata he
 Soap water is a typical example of this
 in jalakalilon main vidyucchalakata bhi hoti he
 They are now being used more as refinements
 kalilon main atisookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se browneey gati ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Mergers do not have this action
