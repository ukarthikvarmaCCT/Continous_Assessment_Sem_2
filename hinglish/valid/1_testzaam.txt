 Tulsidas, who has been suffering from the arms for so many days, is it your laziness or anger, mockery or education

 In 1973, Baker was released again with a final chapter titled Outsiders "re-thinking Label Theory"
 " adhyay main, baker aalochakon kaa tark he ki labling siddhant vichlan ke ek atialgical spashtikaran yaa kaise vyaktiyon pehali jagah main vichlit krity karne ke liye aane kaa ek vivaran pradaan karne main vifal rahata he ke liye jawaab he
 Baker points out that the theory was not meant to be taken as a comprehensive theory of deviation, nor was it meant to explain deviant behavior as simply the product of out-of-control effects
 balki, labling siddhant "jis tarah se labling par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa matlab tha paristhitiyon main abhinayta sthanon par jo yah use rosemara kii jindagi kii saamaanya dincharya jari rakhane or is prakaar use karne ke liye "asaamaanya" kaaryon ko bhadakaane ke liye kathin banaate hai

 The term of the 21st Law Commission is till 2018 and Justice Balbir Singh Chauhan is its chairman
 pratham ayog 1833 ke charter act ke antargat san 1834 main bana
 At the time of its creation, India was under the rule of the East India Company but there was no single power to pass laws, the jurisdiction of the courts was vague and mutually touching and the nature of some statutes was also unfavorable to India
 is sthiti ko drushti main rakhte hue lard maikale ne british parlment main bharat ke liye ek vidhi ayog kii nirmiti par bal diya
 The First Commission had four members of which Macaulay was chairman
 is ayog ko vartmaan nyaayalayon ke adhikarashetra evam niyamavali, tathaa british bharat main prachlit samast vidhi ke vishay main jaanch karne, report dene or jati dharmadi ko dhyaan main rakhkar uchit suzav dene kaa kaary saunpa gaya
 First, the commission's attention was drawn towards criminal law
 bengal tathaa madras main islamic dandvidhi prachlit thi jo apane aadimpan evam avichaarikta ke kaaran sarvatha anupyukt thi
 Under the guidance of Macaulay, the First Commission prepared the draft Indian Penal Code, but due to this reason it could not be turned into a law
 bharat kaa civil laa bhi astavyast dasha main tha
 The report given to it, which was called the Country Law Report, was considered highly important but remained a subject of intense controversy
 uskaa keval ek khand hi paarit hua-jati niryogyata nivarak vidhi
 This commission also became inactive after Macaulay retired

 It was entrusted with the task of giving a report after examining the formats presented by the First Commission, and the suggestions given by the Commission for the improvement of the court and justice process

 In its first report, the Commission suggested the unification of the Supreme Court at Fort William and the Sadar civil and Nizamat courts, presenting codes and plans of procedural law

 This work was completed again after a century
 is ayog kii aay keval teen varsh rahi
 The primary reason for the appointment of the Third Commission was the lack of Second Commission
 simit samay main dwitiya ayog kaary purna na kar sakaa tha
 The Third Commission was created in 1861
 iske sammukh mukhya samasya thi moulik divaani vidhi ke sangrah kaa praaroop bananaa
 The appointment of the Third Commission was the first step towards codification of Indian law

 The seventh and final report was about the revision of the Criminal Code
 in reporton ke uparaant bhi unhen vidhi kaa rup dene main bhartiya shashan ne koi tatparta nahin dikhaai
 In 1869, members of the Commission also attracted the attention of the officials towards this subject
 kintu parinaam kuch na niklaa
 Meanwhile the differences between the members and the Government of India on the format of the contract law took a formidable form, consequently the members of the Commission resigned expressing dissatisfaction and thus ended the Third Commission
 chaturth ayog ke janm kaa bhi mukhya kaaran tritiy ayog ke samaan dwitiya ayog kii dwitiya report thi
 The Government of India had entrusted the work of legal form of several branches to Witley Stokes which was completed in 1879 AD

 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

aarambh main gandhi ji ne angrejon ke prayaason ko ahimsaatmak naitik sahyog dene kaa paksh liya kintu duusare congress ke netaaon ne yuddh main janata ke pratinidhiyon ke paraamarsh liye bina isamen ekatarfa shaamil kiye jane kaa virodh kiya
 All the elected members of the Congress collectively resigned their posts
 lambii charchaa ke baad, gandhi ne ghoshnaa kii ki jab swayan bharat ko aazaadee se inkaar kiya gaya ho tab loktantric aazaadee ke liye baahar se ladane par bharat kisi bhi yuddh ke liye party nahin banegi
 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest
 police kii goliyon se hajaaron kii sankhya main swatantraaa senaanee yaa to maare gaye yaa ghayal ho gaye or hajaaron giraftaar kar liye gaye
 Gandhi and his supporters made it clear that he would not support the war effort unless India was granted immediate independence
 unhone spasht kiya ki is baar bhi yah aandolan band nahin hoga yadi hinsa ke vyaktigat krityon ko moort rup diya jaataa he
 He said that the order of chaos around him is worse than real anarchy
 unhone sabhi congressiyon or bharatiyon ko ahimsa ke saath karo yaa maro ke dwaara antim swatantrata ke liye anushaasan banaae rakhane ko kaha
 Gandhiji and all members of the Congress Working Committee were arrested by the British on 9 August 1942 in Mumbai
 gandhi ji ko pune ke anga khan mahal main do saal tak bandi banaakar rakhaa gaya
 This was the time when Gandhiji suffered two deep blows in his personal life
 unka 50 saal purana sachiv mahadev desai 6 din baad hi dil kaa daura padane se mar gaye or gandhi ji ke 18 maheene jail main rahane ke baad 22 farvari 1944 ko unki patni kasturba gandhi kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Six weeks later, Gandhiji also suffered from severe malaria
 unke kharaab swasthya or jaruri upachaar ke kaaran 6 may 1944 ko yuddh kii samaapti se purv hi unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 Raj did not want to see him dying in jail which would increase the anger of the country
 haalanki bharat chodo andolan ko apane uddeshy main ashink safalataa hi mili lekin andolan ke nishthur daman ne 1943 ke ant tak bharat ko sangathit kar diya
 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega
 Between 1948, over 5000 people were killed during the violence
 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition
 kanges netaa jaanate the ki gandhi ji bantwaare kaa virodh karenge or uski sahmati ke bina congress ke liye aage bajhnaa basambhav tha chuki patarthi main gandhi ji kaa sahyog or sampurna bharat main unki sthiti majboot thi
 Close associates of Gandhiji accepted Partition as the best solution and Sardar Patel tried to convince Gandhiji that this was the only way to prevent a war with civil unrest
 majboor gandhi ne apni anumati de di
 He held intense discussions with leaders of Muslim and Hindu communities in North India as well as Bengal to calm the warm attitude
 1947 ke bharat-pakistan yuddh ke baavjood unhen us samay pareshaan kiya gaya jab sarkaar ne pakistan ko vibhaajan parishad dwaara banaae gaye samjhaute ke anusaar 55 karod rou0 na dene kaa nirnay liyaatha
 Leaders like Sardar Patel feared that Pakistan could use this money to wage war against India
 jab yah maang uthne lagi ki sabhi muslimon ko pakistan bheja jaae or muslimon or hindu netaaon ne is par asantosh vyakt kiya or ek duusare ke saath samjhauta karne se manaa karne se gandhi ji ko gaharaa sadma pahunchaa
 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya
 The leaders of Hindu Muslim and Sikh community assured them that they would forget peace and bring peace

 Thus, Gandhiji broke his fast by drinking orange juice

 Gandhiji devoted his life to the truth, or the wider pursuit of truth
