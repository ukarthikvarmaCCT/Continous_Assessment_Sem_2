 tengri pracheen turk logon or mongol logon ke dharm ke mukhya devtaa the
 They were recognized in many Mongol and Turkish communities such as Shionganu and Xianbei and the religion of those people is called Tengri religion
 turki logon kii sabase pehali kagaanath ne, jiskaa naam goekaturk kagaanath tha, bhi inhen apana rashtriya devtaa tehraaya tha or uske kagaan bhi apni gaddi par virajman hone kaa kaaran 'tengri kii ichha' bataate the
 Tengri was called the 'god of the sky' or 'father of the blue sky'
 aksar mongol shaasha apane raaj ke peeche 'sanathan nile akaash kii ichha' hone kii baat kiya karte the
 The ancient Mongols and Turks believed that the Tengri donated power to humans, which was called 'kut' in their language
 'qut' shabd main bindu-vaale 'qa' ke uccharan par dhyaan den kyonki yah bindu-rahit 'k' se zaraa alag he 
 The names of many Turkish and Mongol celebrities were based on the word 'qut', such as 'qutlugh', 'tengrikut' and 'qutlamish'
 haalaanki tengri dharm ko turki or mongol kshetron main islam or buddha dharm aane se lupt ho gaya, lekin uske chihn abhi bhi is kshetra main faile hue hai - Budhupur is a village in Patiali block of Etah district

 satyagrah kaa shabdic arth satya ke liye aagrah karnaa hota he
 Satyagraha, until the beginning of the dissolution of the law to protect the rights of Indians in South Africa in the last decade of the nineteenth century, the world was familiar with the "disarm weapon" or the strategy of passive resistance
 iskaa vajah keval kaale gore ke bich bhed bhav tha 
 If the power of the opposition is more than us, then there was no meaning of armed protest, they believed in non-violence, so they were fighting this battle
 sabal pratipakshi se bachane ke liye "ni:shastr pratikaar' kii yudhniti kaa avlamban kiya jaataa tha
 In England, women had adopted this "passive resistance" route to obtain suffrage
 is prakaar pratikaar main pratipakshi par shastr se akraman karne kii baat chhodkar use duusare har prakaar se tang karnaa, chal kapat se use haani pahunchaana, athwa uske shatru se sandhi karke use nicha dikhaanaa aadi uchit samajha jaataa tha
 Gandhiji did not like this kind of maladministration
 dakshin africa main unke andolan kii kaarypaddati bilkul bhinn thi unka sara darshan hi bhinn tha at: apni yudhniti ke liye unako nae shabd kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui
 To get the right word, he organized a competition in which the late Maganlal Gandhi suggested a word "sadagraha" in which Gandhiji accepted the word "satyagraha" by making a slight change
 america ke darshanik thoro ne jis civil disobidiens kii technic kaa varnan kiya he, "satyagrah' shabd us prakriya se miltaa julata tha
 The basic meaning of "satyagraha" is to urge the truth to hold the truth and to accept non-violence with it
 anyaay kaa sarvatha virodh karte hue anyaayi ke prati vairabhav na rakhana, satyagrah kaa mul lakshan he
 We should fearlessly follow the truth, and even while dying, we should not have rage or anger towards whom Satyagraha is against
 ' "satyagraha" has no place for violence against its adversary
 ve ahimsha vaadi the 
 With patience and sympathy, the opponent should be freed from his mistake, because what appears to be true to one, may appear wrong to the other
 dhairya kaa taatpary kshtsahan se he
 Hence the meaning of this principle is, "preserving the truth not by giving pain or pain to the opponent, but by suffering himself
" ' Mahatma Gandhi had said that a verse in Satyagraha is "love"
 satyagrah madhyampadlopi samaas he
 Satyagraha is the urge by love for truth
 gandhi ji ne lard inter ke saamne satyagrah kii sankshipt vyakhya is prakaar kii thi-"yah aisa andolan he jo puri tarah sachai par kaayam he or hinsa ke upayon ke evaj main chalaaya ja rahaa
 'ahimsa is the most important element of the Satyagraha philosophy, because the only way to reach the truth and stick to it is non-violence
 or gandhi ji ke hi shabdon main "ahimsa kisi ko chot na pahunchaane kii nakaaratmak vrittimaatr nahin he, balki vah sakriy prem kii vidhayak vritti he
 ' satyagrah main swayan ksht uthaane kii baat he
 Following the truth is a matter of death
 satya or ahimsa ke pujari ke shastraagaar main "upwas' sabase shaktishaalee shastr he
 Fasting is mandatory for anyone who does not take shelter of violence in some form
 mrityu paryant ksht sahan or isliye mrityu paryat upwas bhi, satyagrahi kaa antim astr he
 'but if fasting takes the form of self-compulsion to compel others, then it is worthless: Acharya Vinoba, who is called benign, gentle, benign Satyagraha, is the last place for fasting in that role
 "satyagrah' ek pratikaarapaddati hi nahin he, ek vishisht jeevanapaddati bhi he jiske mul main ahimsa, satya, aparigrah, astey, nirbhayata, brahrichary, sarvadharm sambhaav aadi ekadash vrath hai
 Whose personal life is not pure because of these fasts, he cannot be a true Satyagrahi
 isiilie vinoba in vraton ko "satyagrah nishtha' kehete hai
 There is as much difference between "satyagraha" and "disarmament Retaliation" as between North and South Pole
 ni:shastr pratikaar kii kalpana ek nirbal ke astr ke rup main kii gai he or usamen apane uddeshy kii siddhi ke liye hinsa kaa upyog varjit nahin he, jabaki satyagrah kii kalpana param shur ke astr ke rup main kii gai he or isamen kisi bhi rup main hinsa ke prayog ke liye sthaan nahin he
 Thus Satyagraha is not a passive state
 vah prabal sakriyata kii sthiti he
 Satyagraha is non-violent retaliation, but it is not passive
 anyaayi or anyaay ke prati pratikaar kaa prashn sanathan he
 In the development of its civilization, man has mainly adopted four methods for retaliation- pehali paddati he buraai ke badale adhik buraai
 Dandaneti was born by this method, when it attempted to solve the problems of society and nation, the institution of war developed
 duusari paddati he, buraai ke badale samaan buraai arthath aparaadh kaa uchit dand diya jaae, adhi nahin
 This is an attempt to limit undue retribution
 teesri paddati he, buraai ke badale bhalaai
 It is the path of saints like Buddha, Jesus, Gandhi etc
 isamen hinsa ke badale ahimsa kaa tatv antarnihit he
 The fourth method is to ignore evil
 acharya vinoba kehete hai- "buraai kaa pratikaar mat karo balki virdohi kii samuchit chintan main sahaayta karo
 Support him in good faith
 shuddh vichaar karne, sochane samajhane, vyaktigat jivan main uskaa amal karne or dusron ko samajhane main hi hamaare lakshya kii purti honi chahie
 Helping in proper thinking of the front is the true form of Satyagraha
 ' ise hi vinoba satyagrah ko saumytar or saumyatam prakriya kehete hai
 Satyagraha is a process of love
 use kram-kram, adhikadhik nikharate janaa chahie
 Satyagraha is nothing new, family life is only spread in political life
 gandhi ji kii dein yah he ki unhone satyagrah ke vichaar kaa raajnneetik jivan main samuhik prayog kiya
 It is said
 loktantr main, jahaan sara kaam "lok' kii raay se, lokpratinidhiyon ke madhyam se chal rahaa he, satyagrah ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 Vinoba says - Actually the need for collective satyagraha will not be in the system in which the decision will be by consensus, not by majority
 parantu us dasha main bhi vyaktigat satyagrah padosi ke samyak chintan main sahakaar ke liye to ho hi saktaa he
 But in a democracy, when there is full opportunity for freedom and thought, Satyagraha should not take the form of "pressure, siege or closure" of some kind
 aisa hua to satyagrah kii saumyata nasht ho jaaegi
 Satyagrahi will be disinherited from his religion
 aaj duniya ke vibhinn konon main satyagrah evam ahimsak pratikaar ke prayog nirantar chal rahe hai
 In the Second World War, thousands of anti-war moneylenders' have gone to jails instead of enlisting in the army

 ye saare prayaas bhale hi satyagrah kii kasuti par khare na utarate hon, parantu ye shanti or ahimsa kii disha main ek kadam avashya hai
 Regarding how the form of Satyagraha will take place in international conflict, Acharya Vinoba says - Suppose, if the invader enters our village, then i will say that you come with love - we will go to meet them, not afraid
 parantu ve koi galat kaam karana chaahate he to ham unase kahenge, ham yah baat maan nahin sakate hai-chaahe tum hamen samaapt kar do
 This form of Satyagraha has not yet been used to solve international problems
 parantu yadi anuyug kii vibheeshikaa se maanav samskruti kii raksha ke liye, hinsa kii shakti ko apdasth karke ahimsa kii shakti ko pratishthit hona he, to satyagrah ke is maarg ke atirikt pratikaar kaa doosraa maarg nahin he

 He was a master at making family films based on human values
 tarachand barajatya kaa janm 10 may 1914 ko rajasthan main hua tha
 He started his graduation from Vidyasagar College in Kolkata and worked as an apprentice at Motimahal Theater in 1933 at the age of 19 as a trainee without any salary and he achieved success for his boss

 Financially, he got the benefit of the fact that most of the films he got the rights to distribute went well
 The most important name of the filmmaker directors who trusted him was Manmohan Desai, who gave him the rights to distribute many of his successful films - Amar Akbar Anthony, Parvarish, Dharamvir, Kuli etc
 Among the successful films that benefited him the most were Sholay, Jugnu, Roti, badjata kaa ek bada avdaan yah bhi he ki unke madhyam se dakshin bhartiya film jagat se hindi samaaj zyada jud paaya
 Based on his experiences in the film production sector of South India, he felt that these regional films should get national base

 Initially big makers like Gemini, AVM, Prasad did not believe it but they were convinced when Tarachand Barjatya assured them and promised to help in distribution

 He was born in Europe, Italy
 ye florence ke naagarik the
 His family was ancient, yet not upper-class
 unka janm us samay hua jab madhyayugin vichaardhaara or samskruti ke punarutthan kaa prarambh ho rahaa tha
 Political ideas and arts beliefs were also changing
 dante italy ke sarvshereshth kavi maane jate hai jinke sambandh main angrez kavi shelli ne kaha he ki, The poetry of Dante is like that bridge which is built on the current of time and connects the ancient world with the modern world
 dante ne latin bhashaa main naa likhakar saadhaaran bolchaal kii italvi bhashaa main apana mahakavy likhaa maatrubhaasha or lokprachlit bhashaa ko apni mahaan kritiyon se gauravanvit kiya
 This work was similar to Tulsidas's writing of Ramcharitmanas in the language
 vastav main yah samay vishvabhar main lokbhasha kii pratishtha ke aandolan kaa samay tha
 In India also, Ramanand, Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Vidyapati, Kabir, Sur, Tulsidas, etc
, likewise made a movement for literature in the lingua franca
 vastav main dante kaa yah kaary yugaparivartan kaa shankhanaad tha
 Dante is immortalized by Divine Comedia in the Italian language
 dante keval kavi or vichaarak hi nahin the, varan ve raajnneetik netaa or prashaasak bhi the
 He also ruled the state of Florence
 parantu unke kala or kavy-shaastra sambandhi vichaar unki kriti de valgari elocuo main praapt hote hai
 Not only satisfied with the excellent poem, he also tells what the best poem depends on
 prem jaise vishyon ko or lokbhashaon ko apni rachanaaon main mahatva pradaan karke unhone greek or latin paramparaon ke viruddh ek krantikari padaanyas kiya
 The best creation can be possible only when harmony with Dante's thought, harmonious language, good expressive style and appropriate content
 is prakaar dante ne sarvshereshth rachana ke liye bhadde or graamy shabdon ko chhodkar lokbhasha se or shishtbhaasha se bhi uttam shabdon kaa chayan kar apane kavy kii rachana kii he
 The Vulgery Elocuo Granth has been widely praised by George Sainsbury
 dante ke baad italy main utana bada mahatvapurn kavy chintak kroche ke purv nahin hua
 Apart from Greek and Latin literature, Aligyari Dante also had a special interest in theology
 raajnneeti main vah naram dal kaa anuyaayi or samarthak tha kintu san 1301 main jab guilfon ke krantikari dal dwaara iske paksh kii paraajay hui, tab daante tathaa uske saathiyon ko deshnikale kaa dand bhogana padaa
 Unfortunately, if he was caught by the Florentine government after this conviction, he was likely to be burned alive
 is samay se mrityu paryant vah ek sthaan se duusare or duusare se tisare ek ek tirthayatri kii yaa kareeb kareeb ek bhikhaari kii tarah baraabar bhatakta rahaa
 These days its position was like a rudderless boat
 dar dar kii thokaren khate hue usne badi katutaa ke saath anubhav kiya ki duusare ke ghar kii roti kitni swadaheen hoti he or paraye ghar kii sidhiyon par chadhate utarate rahane main kitni pidaa kaa anubhav hota he
 In 1316, a public declaration was made by Florence, and on some derogatory terms, she was also allowed to return to Florence
 usne ise thukraa die or ant tak pravaas main hi jeevanyaapan kaa nishchay kiya
 He died in Ravenna in 1321 and was buried there
 ravenna ke adhikari aaj bhi uske shav ko uski janmabhoomivaalon ko lautaane ke liye taiyaar nahin, jinhone uske saath aisa nindaneey vyavhaar kiya tha
 The names of the two women are closely associated with the life of the teeth
 ek he biatris portinari or duusari jemya donaati
 The first was her puberty beloved whom she saw when she was only nine years old
 simon di bardi ke saath biatris kaa vivaah ho jane tathaa thode hi samay ke bheetar san 1290 main uski mrityu ho jane ke baad bhi daante uske anuraag main duba rahaa
 The second woman, Gemya, was his married wife with whom he was married in 1277
 daante ke nirvasit hone par usne uskaa saath nahin diya
 It is clear that the teeth were not satisfied with his behavior and color, and later started hating him
 daante kii rachanaaon kii suvidha kii drushti se ham teen bhaagon yaa kaalon main baant sakate hai
 In the first part, those works can be kept in which the enthusiasm of youth and its fervent affection for Biatris is reflected in religious conversion
 isaki avadhi mote taur par 1283 se 1290 tak maani ja sakati he
 The most important composition of this period is Vita Nuova
 doosraa bhaag viatris kii mrityu ke baad shuru hota he
 It can be expanded from 1291 to 1313
 is kaal main uskaa jivan niraashaa, du:kha evam vishwaas par asthaayee rup se tarkbuddhi kaa praadhanya chaa gaya or uskaa jhukaav darshan tathaa vigyaan kii or adhik ho gaya
 He continued to indulge in a tussle or schemes in the acrimony of political quarrels
 is kaal kii mukhya rachanaayen hai - di konvivio, di moderkiya, di ipicills aadi
 From King Henry VII, Dante had set great hopes on which his death was destroyed
 uski samast yojanaayen ekaek samaapt ho gai kintu ganimat yahi rahi ki ve uskaa sampurna hausala post na kar sakin
 He once again moved towards spiritual balance
 yuvavastha ke vichaar or vishwaas usamen pun: jaag uthe or vah divangat biatris kii pavitribhoot aatma kii upasna kii ore or bhi dridhtaa se unmukh ho uthaa
 In many poems of 'divine Comedy', its evidence is scattered
 daante kii rachanaaon kaa yah teesraa kaal 1314 se 1321 tak, yane uski mrityu ke samay tak, mana ja saktaa he
 We can call 'the Vita Nuova' as Italy's first erotica
 isamen kavihruday kii ukt bhaawanaaon ke manovaigyanik vishleshan kii jhalak hamen dekh padati he
 How her new life started only after the first darshan of Biotris, how the woman's sense of beauty and beauty continued to get stronger in her heart, how she slowly got her hopes and love and devotion
 It became a center, at the same death, how much mental anguish and ecstasy he suffered and how his earthly love finally culminated in divine devotion and worship
 This can be seen in poetry
 biatris kii mrityu ke baad uskaa dhyaan kuch varshon ke liye ihlokik bhaawanaaon, vichaaron tathaa swaarthon kii ore gaya or vah niraashaaon athwa sanshayon ke bich hilore khaane laga
 We can see this in his second work 'conbaivs'
 in donon rachanaaon main biatris kahan or kab ek alokik saundarya kii pratimaa prathit hoti he or kahan vah maatr ek darshanik athwa dharmik drushti se kalpit divya chaaya si dekh padati he, iskaa vivechan karnaa anaavashyak he
 Suffice it to say that 'vita Nuova' is a mental elevation of the poet towards a higher sattvikta and reverence rather than an ordinary love story
 isamen andeh nahin ki aashaa niraashaaon ke vividh antardvandvon ke baavjood daante kaa hriday baar baar isi ore prayavarti hone ke liye sachesht hota jaan padataa he
 In fact, it is only from the last part of the poetry that one begins to cast a shadow on the poet's psyche, the focal world, whose center was Biatrice, and which mattered in his poetic poem called 'divine Comedy'
 daante kii laathini rachanaaon main 'de monarkia' vishesh ullekhneey he
 It shows that the need of the empire is in a way supported by God
 unamem rajya tathaa carch yaa dharmik sanstha ke pruthak pruthak kshetra kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he or is baat par bal diya gaya he ki pope kii satta keval dharmik maamalon tak hi simit rahani chahie
 Thoughts of this intention have been expressed in many of the letters to him in the collection of Ephesians
 daante ke paksh vipaksh main kaaphi aalochanaayen hui jinke uski kirti kabhi kabhi malin ho jaati si dikhaai padati thi
 Yet there is no doubt that he was a great poet who influenced many of his later poets and litterateurs
 samay bitne par anek vidwaanon or vichaarkon ne uski bhuri bhuri prashansa kii he jisase aaj vishwa ke sahityakaron tathaa kaviyon main use yathesht unchaa sthaan dene main sahaayta milti he

 aluminium ek rasinic tatv he jo dhaaturup main paaya jaataa he
 It is the most commonly found metal in the earth's crust
 aluminium kaa ek pramukh ayask he - boxit
 It is mainly made up of aluminum oxide, iron oxide and some other impurities
 bear prakram dwaara in ashuddhiyon ko dur kar diya jaataa he jisase sirf alumina batch jaataa he
 Pure aluminum is obtained from alumina by electrical decomposition
 aluminium dhaatu vidyut tathaa ooshmaa kaa chaalak tathaa kaafii halki hoti he
 Because of this it is used in making airplane parts
 bharat main jammu kashmir, mumbai, kolhapur, jabalpur, ranchi, sonbhadra, balaghat tathaa katni main boxit ke vishaal bhandar paae jate he
 Orissa-based Nalco is the world's cheapest aluminum manufacturer
 aluminium shwet rang kii ek dhaatu he
 The Latin word alumen and the English word alum mean alum
 is fitkaree main se jo dhaatu pruthak kii ja saki, uskaa naam aluminium padaa
 Our introduction to alum is very old
 kankshi, tuvari or saurashtraj iske puraane naam he
 Alum is in fact a double compound of both potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate
 san 1754 main margraph ne yah pradarshit kiya ki jis mitti ko alumina kaha jaataa he, vah chooney se bhinn he
 Sir Humphrey Davy tried to separate the metal from alumia soil in 1807, but was not successful
 san 1825 main arsted ne aluminium chloride ko potacium sanras ke saath garam kiya or phir aswan karke paare ko uda diya
 There was a sparkle of metal in the powder that remained after doing this
 yahi dhaatu aluminium kahalaai
 In 1845, Frederick Wöhler used potassium metal as a reducing agent in the preparation of this metal
 use is dhaatu ke kuch chote-chote kan mili, jinaki pariksha karke usne bataaya ki yah nai dhaatu bahut halki he or iske taar khinche ja sakate hai
 Subsequently, in 1854, Devil prepared a good amount of this metal using sodium and sodium aluminum chloride
 us samay nai dhaatu hone ke kaaran aluminium kii ginati bahumoolya dhaatuon main kii jaati thi or iskaa upyog abharanon or alankaaron main hota tha
 In 1886, Charles Martin Hall in Ohio City isolated alumina mixtures in a smelled cryolite and an aluminum metal from it by electrification
 europe main bhi lagbhag isi varsh hero ne swatantra rup se isi prakaar yah dhaatu taiyaar kii
 The same hall-hero method is being used in the production of this metal nowadays
 halaki or sasti hone ke kaaran aluminium or usase bani mishra dhaatuon kaa prachlan tab se baraabar badhata chalaa ja rahaa he
 Two minerals are of special use for preparing aluminum metal
 ek to bauksoit or doosraa cryolite 
 Extensive deposits of bauxite have been found in the districts of Ranchi, Palamu, Jabalpur, Balaghat, Salem, Belgaum, Kolhapur, Thana etc
 in India
 is desh main is khanij kii anumit maatra 2
8 karod ton he
 The first attempt made to produce aluminum metal is to obtain pure alumina from bauxite
 bauksite ke shodhan kii ek vidhi, bair vidhi ke naam par prachlit he
 In this, bauxite is absorbed with hot caustic soda solution to form sodium aluminate
 is aluminute ke vilyan ko chaan lete hai or isamen se phir alumina kaa avakshepan kar liya jaataa he
 
 alumina se aluminium dhaatu haul-hero-vidhi dwaara taiyaar kii jaati he
 The cell that is used for electrolytic analysis is a large box made of steel, with a carbon lining inside
 carbon kaa yah astr coke, pich or tarkol ke mishran ko tapaakar taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, carbon dioxide is also prepared
 ye bahudhaa 12-20 inch lambey ytaakar hote hai
 These dhanagras are hanging from a conductor latch and can be lowered at will
 vidyut cell ke bheetar galaa hua cryolite lete hai or vidyuddhara is prakaar niyantrit karte rahete hai ki uske pravaah kii garmi se hi cryolite baraabar galit avasthaa main bana rahe
 When the electrolyte is formed, the aluminum metal formed is heavier than the cryolite, hence settling down in the cell
 yah dhaatu hi runagra kaa kaam karti he
 The corroded metal is periodically flushed out of the cell
 cell main bich-bich main aavashyaktaanusaar or alumina milaate jate hai
 To reduce the melting point of cryolite, it is often added with a little calcium fluoride
 yah ullekhneey he ki aluminium dhaatu ke kaarkaane kii safalataa sasti bijli ke upar nirbhar he
 Sections ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 amperes have been used in trading methods

 Jean Brody in Muriel Spark's outspoken novel of Miss Jean Brody; And based on this novel but differing greatly in the interest of original theater and poetic license, Presson Allen has a fictional character in the play of the same name and the 1969 film
 miss broady ek atiranjit romantic duniya ko dekhne ke saath ek ucch adarshavaadi charitra he, jis ke bahut se suutaravakya angreji bhashaa main clice ban gaye hai
 The character's name is the historical Jean Brody, the fictional wife or mistress of Willie Brody, who claims to be a direct descendant of the fictional Brody; Thus, he is the fictional homonym of the real Gene Brody
 asli dickon vili broady vastav main ek cabinetmekar or jibat kaa nirmaataa tha jise vastav main usne khud dizine kiya ho saktaa he
 Dickon Brody was a decon of Kirk o 'scotland; He had looted the excise office; And the gibbet with which he was hanged may have been designed by himself
 isi tarah, dickon broady kii kaalpanik vanshaj haalanki bahut adhik maanav or dilkash he use swayan ko hi aahat karne dwaara varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 The story of William and Jean Watt Brody has been preserved for posterity by W

 Henley and Robert Louis Stevenson in the Deacon Brodie Remembrance Double Life — a Melodrama in Five Acts and Eight Toubas
 yah naatak 2 july 1884 ko landan main prince'za theatre main khelaa gaya, jisamen shri i je henli ne dican wiliam brody kaa or miss minni bel ne jin kaa role kiya
 Mr
 Henley reprized his performance in Montreal on 26 September 1887, this time with Miss Carrie Cott in the role of Jean Watt / Brodie
 upanyaas main, miss jin brody 1930 ke edinburgh, scotland main ladakiyon ke roodhiwaadee skool, marsia blen main ek skool shikshak he
 She is a charismatic virgin who is becoming a stranger in her surroundings
 1930 main, us ne ghoshnaa kii ki us kaa praim shuru ho gaya he or yah sunishchit karne ke liye chal padati he ki uski class ke liye yah sunishchit karne se ki unhen naatak, kala or fasivadi vishwaason se avgat karaayaa gaya he, uske praim kaa purna laabh mili
 Outside her class, she selects her favorite girls and attempts to mold them into the crème de la crème
 upanyaas main, ye sandy, monica, jeni, younis, rose or mairi mcgrager hai
 There is also a tombuae, Joyce Emily, who attempts to forcefully enter the Brodie set, but is originally rejected by Miss Brody
 sandy aakhirkaar ek math main nan, sistar helena ban jaati he; mariyam mcgrager ek hotel main aag lagane se mar jaati he; or jois emily spanish grihayuddh main chali jaati he, jahaan use maar diya jaataa he
 Other teachers and the headteacher, Miss mckay, are saddened by the fact that Miss Brody's "special girls" are different from the rest, with no school team displaying the spirit the school tries to encourage
 varshon ke baad sandy or anya senior skool or duniya main chale gaye hai, miss maike kii sandy ke saath ek niyukti he jisamen vah is tathy ko kuredati he ki "yah abhi bhi chal rahaa he", yani ki miss brody yuva ladakiyon ke ek or sat ko prashikshan de rahi he, jo sochane lag jaayenge ki ve anya ladakiyon kii tulana main behatar hai
 Sandy then betrays Miss Brody by telling Miss mckay about Miss Brody's interest in educating her for fascist politics, which would not be tolerated by parents in such a school
 aasaani se us se chhutkaaraa mil gaya, or use andeh he ki mairi ne dhokhaa diya tha, haalanki yah sandy thi
 In the novel, Miss Brody dies of cancer in 1946
 naatak or film upanyaas se ullekhneey prasthaan dikhaate hai
 As adapted for stage and screen by Jay Presson Allen, the story is told in a largely linear fashion
 yah 1932 main shuru hoti he, jab miss broady italy main apni garmi kii chhuttiyon se laut ai he, yah mahasoos karne ke baad ki uskaa praim aa chukaa he
 The essential elements of a character and a story are the same, although some characters are different and / or have different endings
 udhaaharan ke liye, mairi mcgrager, hotel kii aag main nahin marati jo snaatak hone ke varshon baad kii baat he, lekin vah maaria blen main apane antim varsh main maar di jaati he, jab vah apane bhai se judane jaati he jo spanish grihayuddh main lard rahaa he
 She dies when the car in which she is traveling is blown
 naatak main ham baad ke jivan main sandy ko ek nan ke rup main dikhaa rahe kuch drishyon ko dekhte hai
 In the film we have no idea what happens to Sandy or any other girl after graduation, because it ends there
 kitaab main miss broady ko sandy dwaara us samay dhokhaa diya jaataa he, jab vah or ladkiyaan skool chhod gayi hai or duniya main chali gayi hai, naatak or film main 1936 ke skool varsh ke ant se kuch hafte pehle snaatak hone se pehle vishwasghaat kiya jaataa he

 The current Pythagorean method at the time would have claimed that there must have been a sufficiently small, indivisible unit that could fit equally in one of these lengths and the other

 He did this by demonstrating that it is impossible to demonstrate that if the hypotenuse of an equilateral isosceles is actually proportional to an arm, that unit of measurement must be both even and odd, which is impossible
 
 uskaa tark is prakaar he: Greek mathematicians called this ratio of incommensurable magnitudes alogos or indescribable
 However, Hipassus was not praised for his efforts: according to a legend, he made this discovery during a voyage and was later thrown out of the ship by Pythagorean companions "

 The discovery of whatever consequences Hippasus himself had to face posed a very serious problem for Pythagorean mathematics, as it dismantled the notion that numbers and geometry are inescapable — the basis of his theory

 The magnitudes were in contrast to the numbers, which were bouncing from one value to another, such as 4 to 5
 The numbers are made up of some minimal, indivisible unit, while the magnitudes are infinitely reducible

 He also introduced an arithmetic approach to the concept of irrationality, as he attributes the following to irrational magnitudes: misr kaa ganitagya abu kamil shuja ebn asalam pratham vyakti tha jisane aparimey sankhyaon ko dwighat sameekaran ke samaadhaan ke rup main yaa ek sameekaran main gunank ke rup main sweekaar kiya, jo aksar varg mul, ghan mul or chauthe mul ke swaroop main hota tha
 In the tenth century, the Iraqi mathematician al-hashimi provided general evidence for irrational numbers in the process of considering multiplication, division, and other arithmetic functions

 In the year 1872, several theories were published, including Karl Weierstrass, Hein, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind
 In 1869 Meray took the same point of departure as Hein, but this theory is commonly cited from the year 1872

 Weierstras, Canter, and Hein based their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind put his bases on the notion of a deduction in a system of real numbers, under which he divided all rational numbers into two groups based on particular properties

 Continuous fractions, which are closely related to irrational numbers, received publicity at the hands of Euler and emerged more through Lagrang's writings in the early nineteenth century
 Dirichlet also contributed to general theory, as did many other contributors to the application of the subject

 Charles Hermit first proved the e-algebra and Ferdinand von Lindemann showed this for π, starting with Hermit's conclusion
 Lindemann's evidence was greatly simplified by Weierstras, later primed by David Hilbert and finally by Adolf Hurwitz and Paul Albert Gordon
 2 kaa varg mul vah pehali sankhya thi jise aparimey sabit kiya gaya or us lekh main kai saboot shaamil hai
 The golden ratio is the next most famous quadratic irrational and there is a simple proof of his irrationality in his article

 The irrationality of the square root of 2 can be proved by assuming it to be rational and concluding a contradiction, called an argument by reductio ad absurdum
 nimnlikhit tark is tathy se do baar apil karata he ki ek visham purnank kaa varg hameshaa visham hota he
 If √2 is rational, its form is m / n for integers m, n, where both are not even
 phir m 2 = 2n 2, isliye m sam he, kah lijiye ki m = 2p 
 is prakaar 4p 2 = 2n 2 isliye 2p 2 = n 2 isliye n bhi sam he, jo ek virodhabhas he
 The above proof for the square root of two can be generalized using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which was proved in 1798 by Gauss
 isse yah bal miltaa he ki har purnank kaa abhajya main adwitiya gunankhandan hota he
 Using this we can show that if a rational number is not an integer, then its integral power cannot be an integer, because the denominator in its minimum term must have a factor that is not divisible by the numerator
 Be extended to any power
 So if an integer is not the exact kth power of another integer, then its kth square is irrational
 ve sankhyaayein jinhen sabase aasaani se aparimey sabit kiya jaataa he ve shaayad kuch khaas laghuganak he
 Here is a proof by reductio ad absurdum that log2 3 is irrational
 dhyaan den ki log2 3 ≈ 1
58> 0
 Suppose log2 3 is rational
 kuch dhanatmak purnank m or n ke liye, hamaare paas he it means that haalanki, sankhya 2 jise kisi bhi dhanatmak purnank ghaat main badhaayaa gaya ho use sam hona chahie or sankhya 3 ko jise kisi bhi dhanatmak purnank ghaat main badhaayaa gaya ho use visham hona chahie 
 jaahir he, ek purnank ek hi samay main sam or visham, donon nahin ho saktaa: hamaare paas ek virodhabhas he
 The only guess we made was that log2 3 is rational
 The contradiction means that this assumption must be false, ie log2 3 is irrational and can never be expressed as a quotient of integers m / n where n is ≠ 0
 log10 2 jaise maamalon ke saath bhi isi tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Almost all irrational numbers are transcendental and all transcendental numbers are irrational: the article with transcendental numbers lists several examples
 e r or πr aparimey hai agar r ≠ 0 parimey he; e π aparimey he
 Another way to construct irrational numbers is to construct irrational numbers as algebraic numbers, that is, as a polynomial with integer coefficients as zero: start with a polynomial equation
 jahaan gunank a i purnank hai
 Suppose you know that some real numbers x exist where p = 0
 The only possible rational root of this polynomial equation will be in the form r / s where r is a divisor of a 0 and s is a divisor of an; There are only a limited number of candidates that you can check with just hands
 agar unamem se koi bhi p kaa mul nahin he, to x zarur aparimey hona chahie
 For example, this technique can be used to show that x = 1 / 3 is irrational: we have 2 = 2 and therefore x 6 - 2x 3 - 1 = 0 and any rational in this latter polynomial
 Is not original
 kyonki bijiy sankhya ek kshetra gathit karte hai, kai aparimey sankhyaon ko bijiy or abijiy sankhyaon ke sangyojan dwaara nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 For example 3π + 2, π + √2 and e √3 are irrational
 ek aparimey sankhya kaa dashamalav vistaar, ek parimey sankhya ke vipareet kabhi doharaata yaa samaapt nahin hota
 To show this, suppose we divide n integer by m
 When the longer part is applied to the part of n by m, only m remainder is possible
 yadi 0 ek sheshfal ke rup main prakat hota he, to dashamalav vistaar samaapt ho jaataa he
 If 0 never appears then that algorithm can run at most m - 1 step without using any remainder more than once
 uske baad, ek sheshfal kii punrariti honi hi chahie or tab dashamalav vistaar doharaata he
 Conversely, suppose we encounter a recurring decimal, then we can prove that it is a fraction of two integers
 udhaaharan ke liye: The length of the repeat is here 3
 ham 103 se guna karte hai: Note that when we multiplied by the length of the repeating part of 10, we moved the digits exactly to the left of the decimal point
 isliye, 1000A kaa pichhlaa sira bilkul a ke pichley sire se mail khaataa he
 Here, both 1000A and a have 162 repeats at the end
 isliye, jab ham donon pakshon se a ko ghataate hai, to 1000A kaa pichhlaa sira a ke pichley sire se baahar radd ho jaataa he: Again

5 = 1 / 2 he, ek vyakti ansh or har ko 2 se guna karke bhinn ko saafe kar saktaa he: 
 antim pankti, 53 / 74, purnankon kaa ek bhagfal he or isliye ek parimey sankhya he
 Here is a well known pure existence or non-creative proof: vahaan do aparimey sankhyaayein a or b maujuud hai, is prakaar ki a b parimey he
 In fact, if √2√2 is rational, then suppose a = b = √2
 Otherwise, assume that a is an irrational number √2√2 and b = √2
 Then ab = √2 = 2√2 · √2 = √22 = 2 which is rational
 haalanki uparyukt daleel donon maamalon ke bich nirnay nahin karti, gelpond-shnyder prameya kaa taatpary he ki √2√2 abijiy he, isliye aparimey he
 It is not known whether π + e or π - e is irrational or not
 vastav main, vahaan gaiyr-shunya purnank m or n kaa koi yugma nahin he jiske bare main yah gyaat ho ki kya m π + ne aparimey he yaa nahin
 Furthermore, it is not known whether the set q is independent according to algebra
 yah gyaat nahin he ki kya 2e, πe, π√2, katalan nirantar, yaa yuler-meshcheroni gamma nirantar γ aparimey hai yaa nahin
 Since the real constitutes an uncountable set, the rational of which is a countable subset, the complementary set of irrationals is uncountable
 saamaanya sudur kriya d = |x - y |, vaastavik sankhya ek metric spes he or isliye ek sansthitikeey spes bhi he
 Limiting the Euclidean remote function gives the irrational the structure of a metric space
 chunki aparimey kaa upspes band nahin he,utprerit metric purna nahin he
 However, with the G-delta set in a complete metric space - ie a countable intersection of open subsets - the irrational space is topologically complete: that is, a metric over the irrational that induces exactly the same topology as the Euclidean
 Restricts the metric, but with respect to which are irrational absolute
 ek vyakti G-delta set ke bare main upar ullikhit tathy se anbhigya rahete bhi ise dekh saktaa he: ek aparimey sankhya kaa satat bhinn vistaar, aparimey ke sthaan se sabhi dhanatmak purnank ke sthaan tak ek homeomorfizam ko paribhaashit karata he, jise aasaani se purna rup se metric yogya dekha jaataa he
 In addition, the set of all irrationals is a truncated metric space

 Alexander Graham Bell is known more generally as the inventor of the telephone
 bahut kam log hi yah jaanate hai ki graham bel ne na keval telephone, balki communication technology ke kshetra main kai or bhi upyogi avishkaar kiye hai
 He is also credited with inventing optical-fiber systems, photophones, bell and decibel units, metal-detectors, etc

 It is also very surprising that at the age of sixteen, he became famous as a great music teacher
 aapangata kisi bhi vyakti ke liye ek abhishaap se kam nahin hoti, lekin graham bel ne aapangata ko abhishaap nahin banane diya
 Actually, Graham Bell's mother was deaf
 maa ke sunne main asamarthta se graham bel kaaphi dukhi or niraash rahete the, lekin apni niraashaa ko unhone kabhi apni safalataa kii raah main rukaawat nahin banane diya
 He thought it better to give his disappointment a positive mode

 It would probably not be wrong to say that Graham Bell spent his entire life working for deaf people
 unki maa to badhir thim hin, graham bel kii patni or unka ek khaas dost bhi sunne main asamarth tha
 Since he had felt the pain of such people very closely from the beginning, he could understand better what should be done for the betterment of his life

 Graham Bell had a keen interest in sound science since childhood, so at the age of 23, he made a piano whose melodious voice could be heard far enough

 During this time, he continued his efforts and was successful in creating an instrument that was capable of sending not only musical notes, but also articulated speech
 yahi telephone kaa sabase purana model tha
 As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father
 ek kam umr main, haalanki, unhone kaha ki vah keval pehle chaar roopon ko puraa karne, skool 15 saal kii umr main chhod diya he jo royal hai skool, edinburgh, scotland, main namankit kiya gaya tha

 The CPI itself believes that it was formed on December 25, 1925 in the party Congress held in Kanpur
 lekin marxvaadi communist party, jo 1964 main hue party-vibhaajan ke baad bani thi, kaa maananaa he ki party kaa gathan 1920 main hua tha
 According to the cpi-m's claim, India's oldest Communist Party was formed on 17 October 1920, soon after the Second Congress of Communist International
 baharhaal, yah kaha ja saktaa he ki 1920 se hi party ke gathan kii prakriya chal rahi thi or is sambandh main kai samooh bhi ubhar kar saamne aaye the

 On 20 March 1929, many important leaders associated with the CPI were arrested in the Meerut conspiracy case

 In 1934, leaders with leftist tendencies within the Congress formed the Congress Socialist Party
 iske gathan ke samay bhakpa ke netaaon ne ise 'saamaajik fasiwad' kii sangya di
 But with the Comintern changing the attitude towards parties like the Indian National Congress in the colonies, the cpi's attitude towards the Congress also changed
 ab bhakpa congress kii raajnneeti ko pragatisheel maanane lagi
 Its members took membership of the left wing section of the Congress i
e
 CSP
 1936-1937 ke dauraan socialiston or communiston ke bich main aapasi sahyog kaafii bad gaya
 At the Second Congress of CSP in January 1936, this thesis was accepted that there was a need to establish a united Indian Socialist Party on the basis of marxism-leninism
 isi tarah, siespi kii teesri congress ke baad bani rashtriya kaaryakaarani samiti main kai communiston ko shaamil kiya gaya
 However, it did not last long
 1940 main congress ke ramgarh adhiveshan main bhakpa ne 'prolitarian path' sheershak se ek dastauez jari kiya
 In this, citing the weak state of the colonial state due to the war, it spoke of waging an armed movement against it
 bhakpa kii is iktarfa ghoshnaa se naaraaz hokar siespi ne communist sadasyon ko apni party se baahar kar diya
 Meanwhile, the ban was lifted in July 1942 due to the good relations between the Soviet Union and Britain in World War II
 isane congress kii upniveshwaad virdohi ranneeti kaa virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 It criticized the Quit India movement of 1942 and severely condemned Subhash Chandra Bose
 is daur main bhakpa kii ek mahatvapurn uplabdhi yah bhi rahi ki usne congress ke majdoor sanghathan aal india trade union congress par apana varchasv kaayam kar liya
 The CPI participated in the provincial elections held in 1946 but won a total of eight seats out of the 1585 provincial assembly seats across the country
 apane gathan ke baad se desh kii azaadi tak bhakpa kii raajnneeti main kai utaar-chadhaav aaye
 It once called the Congress and Mahatma Gandhi a reactionary
 phir unke saath milakar kaam bhi kiya or dubaara unase alag hokar unki raajnneeti kaa virodh kiya
 This opposition reached the extent that he supported British rule during the Quit India Movement
 iske peeche ek mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki bhakpa kii raajnneeti main bhartiya paristhitiyon ko kam ahmiyat di jaati thi
 On most occasions, communist international or Soviet Union directives worked to determine the party's strategy
 isi kaaran kai baar isaki ranneetiyaan ulti disha main aage badhin
 Despite these disturbances, the workers' organization of the Congress and its position in some parts of the country had become quite strong
 bengal main hue tebhaaga andolan or andhra pradesh main hue telugana andolan main bhi communiston ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 In the Tebhaga Movement in 1946, the Bengal totters struggled to have two-thirds of their agricultural produce
 is andolan main bhakpa ke kisaan morche kisaan sabha ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 In some places this movement also turned violent
 andolan safal rahaa or rajya kii muslim lig sarkaar ne yah kanoon banaaya ki jameendaaron ko kul utpaada ke ek- tihaai se zyaada hissaa nahin diya jayega
 But this law did not apply properly
 telugana andolan hyderabad rajavaade main hua
 There was already a movement against the Nizam of Hyderabad under the banner of Andhra Mahasabha
 andhra mahasabha main communiston kii acchhee-kaasi upasthiti thi
 They made the farmers aware against the Nizam and the local landlords
 naalgonda, warangal or khammam jilon main kisaanon ne karz maafi, bandhua mazaduri khatm karne or bhoomi punarvitaran ke liye andolan chalaaya
 This movement started in 1945 and by 1946 it gained a lot of vigor
 nizaam kii senaaon or zameendaaron ke lathaiton ne iskaa krurta se daman kiya
 Thousands of peasants were murdered
 lekin kisaanon ke sashastr daston ne jam kar is daman kaa muqabla kiya
 These squads got control of many villages and they implemented land reform policies there
 1948 tak unhone 3,000 gaanvon kii takreeban 16,000 varg mile bhoomi ko mukt kara liya or uskaa gaanv ke logon ke bich vitaran kar diya
 The Nizam's rule came to an end with the intervention of the Indian Army in September 1948
 iske baavjood kisaanon kaa vidroh jari rahaa
 The Indian Army also violently repressed it
 antatah, 1951 main bhakpa dwaara aadhikarik rup se yah andolan waapas le liya gaya
 After this the movement ended by slowing down
 tebhaaga or telugana andolan kaa bhartiya vampanth ke itihaas main kaafii mahatva he
 It showed the influence of communists on the ground
 vartmaan main communiston ke sabhi samooh in andolanon kii viraasat kaa daawa karte hai
 During the independence of India, there was intense and interesting debate in the CPI about the independence and the nature of the Indian state
 isi kaaran party ne samvidhan sabha main bhi bhaag nahin liya
 When India got independence, P
C
 Joshi was the general secretary of the CPI
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki satta kaa hastantaran vaastavik he or nehru kii sarkaar se yah spasht sanket miltaa he ki vah samrajyavad-virdohi takaton kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 He therefore urged that the CPI should reevaluate its views about the Congress
 lekin party ke bheetar ise paryaapt samarthan nahin mila
 Bt a crème under the leadership of Ranadive argued that mass rebellion was gaining momentum in India
 isliye bhakpa loktantric or samaajawaadee charnon ko mila kar puure raashtra main mazaduron ke sashastr sangharsh dwaara satta par kabza karne kii koshish kar sakati he
 Some within the party compared the Telangana experience to the Mao struggle in China and advocated for a public war against the Indian state
 ise 'andhra line' kaha gaya
 Ranadive Line won in the Calcutta Congress of 1948
 lekin duusari ore bharat main nehru sarkaar dwaara telugana andolan ke sashastr daman kii ijazat dene or duusari ore chini kranti ke safal hone ke kaaran party main 'andhra line' kii sthiti majboot ho gayi
 This led to the leadership of the party by Andhra Pradesh leader C
 Rajeshwar Rao in 1950
 lekin party ke bheetar pi
si
 joshi keme ne is tarah ke kadam ko vampanthi bhatkaav kii sangya di
 This camp criticized the 'blindfolded' and staunch way of following the Chinese way
 joshi ne nehru sarkaar kii deshi-videshi niti kaa vishleshan karte hue yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki isamen samrajyavad-virdohi pravriti he
 To resolve this internal dispute of the party, some senior party leaders went to Moscow and had a long discussion with the Communist Party leaders there
 iske baad teen dastauez taiyaar hue
 These documents made it clear that India is a dependent and semi-colonial country and the Nehru government was catering to the interests of the landlords, the big monopolistic Burzwa and British imperialism
 bhartiya burjwa kii prakruti spasht karte hue yah kaha gaya ki praathmik rup se samrajyavaadee burjwa par nirbhar hone ke baavjood isamen rashtravaadi or a-sahyogi tatva maujuud hai
 After this, moderate leader Ajay Ghosh took command of the party
 is daur main party ne bharat kii azaadi ko manyata di or samvidhan ko sweekaar karte hue chunaavon main bhaag lene kaa faisalaa kiya gaya
 The party's performance in the first general elections cannot be considered very spectacular, but it emerged as the main opposition party by winning 16 seats in the Lok Sabha
 bhakpa ne khaastaur par sangathit kshetra main kaam karne vaale mazaduron ke bich apni sthiti majboot karne par dhyaan diya
 Its labor organization All India Trade Union Congress was well established among the workers
 lekin us samay desh kii raajnneeti main congress or nehru ke varchasv ko chunauti dena mushkil tha
 Nevertheless, the CPI strengthened its position in some states
 duusare aam chunaavon main phir se congress ko spasht bahumat mila, lekin bhakpa kii siton main bhi badhotaree hui
 It won 27 Lok Sabha constituencies in these elections
 kerala main 1957 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad i
em
es
 namboodiripad ke netritv main bhakpa kii sarkaar bani
 It was the first elected communist government in the world
 lekin 1959 main nehru sarkaar ne ise barkhaast kar diya
 This caused a lot of resentment towards Nehru within a section of the CPI
 lekin is samay bhakpa ke kaaryakarta bhram kii sthiti main the, kyonki nehru sarkaar kaa soviet union ke saath kaafii acha sambandh tha
 The Soviet party expected the CPI to adopt a soft attitude towards the Nehru government
 is bich antarrashtriya str par aisi ghatnaayen ghatin jiske kaaran na sirf antarrashtriya communist ekta prabhavit hui, balki bhakpa kaa bhi vibhaajan ho gaya
 By the sixties, relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China began to deteriorate
 china kii communist party ne soviet union kii communist party par aarope lagaaya ki vah sanshodhanavaadee ho kar marxvad-leninavaad ke raste se bhatak chuki he
 Here, relations between China and India also worsened
 seemaa vivaad ke kaaran 1962 main bharat-china ke bich yudgh bhi hua
 a faction of the CPI supported the policy of the Government of India
 vahiin party ke ek duusare dhade ne yah daawa kiya ki yah samaajawaadee or poonjeewaadi rajya ke bich takaraav he
 In fact, the tactics of these factions of the CPI also played an important role in the international trend among communists
 bhakpa ke soviet samarthak dhade ne us samay kii sattadhari party bhartiya rashtriya congress ke saath sahyog karne ke vichaar ko aage badhaayaa
 But another faction of the CPI, which later became the CPI, called it the revisionist idea of 'class-cooperation'
 gauratlab he ki bharat ke tisare aam chunaavon main bhakpa ko 29 siton par jeet mili
 The CPI was still the second largest party in Parliament after the Congress
 lekin party ke ek kheme ke bheetar yah vishwaas prabal ho gaya tha ki asal main nehru sarkaar ke prati zyaada sakht ravaiya na rakhane kaaran hi bhakpa kaa prasar nahin ho rahaa he
 After a time, this conflict increased significantly
 1964 main bhakpa kaa vibhaajan ho gaya or ek nayi party makapa kaa ubhaar hua
 Many militant leaders of the CPI like Namboodiripad, Jyoti Basu, Harkishan Singh Surjeet etc
 joined the CPI (M)
 isse pashchim bengal jaise rajyon main bhakpa ke aadhaar par nakaaratmak prabhaav padaa
 The CPI also had a significant impact for the first few decades of the party's split in Kerala
 1970-77 ke bich bhakpa ne congress se gathjod kiya or uske saath milakar sarkaar bhi banaayi jisamen bhakpa ke si
 achyut menon rajya ke mukhyamantri bane 
 Subsequently, the CPI did not get a chance to come to power in any state
 1970-77 ke daur main congress se gathjod hone ke kaaran bhakpa ne indira gandhi kii congress dwaara lagaaye gayi apatkaal kaa samarthan kiya
 But by the decade of the eighties, the CPI (M) became a stronger Communist Party
 desh ke duusare kai bhaagon main bhakpa kii acchhee upasthiti rahi, lekin kuch kshetron main zyaada majboot upasthiti ke kaaran makapa aage nikal gayi
 After 1977, the CPI formed the Left Front in association with the CPI (M) and other minor communist parties
 vyaavhaarik taur par kerala sahit adhikansh jagahon par yah party makapa ke ek chote sahyogi dal main badal gayi
 On most occasions, its performance depended on the performance of the Left Front
 nabbe ke baad ke daur main bhakpa ne secular or gair-bhaajapa, gair-congress dalon kii raajnneeti ko majbooti dene par kaafii dhyaan diya he
 It opposed the neo-liberal policies of the Congress in association with the CPI-M led Left Front
 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad kisi dal ko bahumat nahin mila
 The BJP government, the largest party, could not prove its majority in the Lok Sabha
 iske baad ech
di
 devegoda ke netritv main sanyukt morche kii sarkaar bani
 The CPI, taking a historic decision, decided to join this government
 yah faisalaa makapa ke faisale se kaafii alag tha jisane jyoti basu ko pradhanmantri banane kaa prastaav thukraa diya tha
 Thus, despite being part of the Left Front, it displayed its political autonomy
 sanyukt morche kii donon sarkaron kii sarkaar main iske netaa shaamil hue or unhone grih mantralay or krishi mantralay jaise mahatvapurn mantralay sambhaale
 After the fall of the United Front government, the NDA government was formed at the center
 is sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bhakpa ne vam morche ke ek ghatak ke rup main zimmedaar vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaai
 The Left Front supported the 2004 United Progressive Alliance government
 isane yah sunishchit karne kii koshish kii yah sarkaar apane nunatam saajha kaarykram ke anusaar hi kaam kare
 During this time, the CPI also pressured the government to adopt several people-oriented programs
 aamtaur prekshak yah maanate rahe hai ki samprag-ek kii sarkaar ke dauraan bane bahut pragatisheel or janonmukhi kanoonon ke peeche vam morche ke dabaav kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi
 In 2008, the Left Front withdrew support from the United States to the UPA government over the nuclear deal issue
 2009 ke aam chunaavon main vam morche kaa pradarshan 2004 ke aam chunaavon kii tulana main kaafii karaab rahaa
 The reason for this was the decline in the performance of the Left Front in West Bengal
 khaastaur par singoor or nandigram jaisi jagahon main rajya sarkaar dwaara jabardastee bhoomi adhigrahan kii koshish or uske virodh kaa bal-prayog dwaara daman karne jaisi ghatnaon ne vam morche kii chhavi kaafii karaab kii
 It also had an impact on the cpi's electoral performance and it won only 4 seats in Lok Sabha compared to 10 in 2004
 bhakpa kii raajnneeti kii kai seemayen ab spasht ho chuki hai : pehla, bhakpa ne vam morche kii raajnneeti main khud kaa is tarah samahit kar liya he ki kai gambheer masalon par bhi isane ek seemaa se zyaada makapa kaa virodh nahin kiya he
 It has shown its autonomy only on a few occasions, but on most issues its strategy is part of the strategy of the Left Front
 doosraa, yadhyapi makapa desh ke teen rajyon main kaafii majboot sthiti main he, lekin bhakpa kaa vistaar desh ke duusare bhaagon main zyaada rahaa he
 For example, CPI also has a strong presence in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu
 lekin bihar jaise rajyon main isane apana aadhaar kaafii had tak kho diya he, kyonki ab pahchaan kii raajnneeti ke saamne vah apni praasangikta sabit karne main naakaam rahi he
 Third, the CPI has failed to expand into new areas like other parliamentary left parties
 yah ek tarah se thahari hui party ban gayi he
 It has either managed to save its base in some places, or is also losing that base
 naye kshetron main bhakpa kaa prasar nahin ho rahaa he
 It won only less than 15 seats in every election of Lok Sabha after 1980
 masalan, 1980 ke sansadeey chunaavon main 11, 1984 main 6, 1989 main 12, 1991 main 14, 1996 main 12, 1998 main 9, 1999 main 4, 2004 main 10 or 2009 main 4 siton par jeet hasil hui
 Fourth, it is also alleged that the CPI has withdrawn from the politics of struggle at the ground level
 yadhyapi is aalochana ko puri tarah se sahi nahin mana ja saktaa, kyonki jin kshetron main bhakpa kaa astitv he, vahaan usne rajya daman ke kilaaf kaafii sangharsh kiya he
 For example, the CPI in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh strongly opposed the state-sponsored Salwa Judum Campaign
 paanchavaan, bhakpa kii raajnneeti kii aalochana kaa ek aadhaar yah bhi rahaa he ki isane poonjeewaadi rajya kii loktantric vyavastha ko puri tarah sweekaar kar liya he
 Now it is working within the nationalist framework and the strategy of overthrowing the capitalist state is not part of its politics
 baharhaal, in aalochanaon ke baavjood is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki bhartiya raajnneeti main bhakpa ke paas ek lambi viraasat he
 Most of the currents of Indian communist politics originated from this party
 isane sansadeey raajnneeti main vampanthi dalon ke bich ekajutata kaayam karne ke bhi gambheer prayaas kiye hai
 It has been trying to strengthen the non-congress, non-bjp politics in India and promote the interests of the common people
 bhrashtachar jaise aaropon se bhakpa har str par puri tarah se mukt rahi he
 In fact, the main challenge of the CPI is that it, despite being part of the Left Front, avoid being a 'photo copy' or small ally of the CPI (M) and maintain its autonomous politics
 iske alaava, desh ke vibhinn bhaagon apana prasar karnaa bhi bhakpa ke liye ek badi chunauti he

 a revolution is a fundamental change in the rights or organizational structure that takes place in a relatively short period of time

 Several generations of scholarly views on the revolution have given rise to many competing theories and have contributed greatly to developing the current understanding of this complex fact
 kopernicus ne surya ke chaaron ore grahon kii gati par likhe gaye apane lekh ko "on da rivolushan of selestial baudies " naam diya
 After this 'revolution' entered into the field of indigenous science related to astrology; Which represented abrupt changes in the social system

 Jeff Goodwin gives two definitions of revolution
 ek vyapak he, jiske anusaar kranti he And a narrow one in which jaik goldstone unhen paribhaashit karte hue kehete hai ki Political and social revolutions have been studied under many social sciences, especially under sociology, political science and history
 Leading scholars in the field include Crane Brinton, Charles Brockett, Farideh Farhey, John Foran, John Mason Hart, Samuel Huntington, Jack Goldstone, Jeff Goodwin, Ted Roberts Gurr, Fred Halliday, Chambers Johnson, Tim mc'daniel, Barrington Moore, Geoffrey Page, Wilfredo Peretto, Terence Ranger, Eugene rosenstock-husey, Theda Skouk Paul, James Scott, Eric Selbin, Charles Tilley, Ellen K
 Trimbringer, Carr Los Vistas, or John Walton, Timothy wickham-crowley and Eric Wolf
 krantiyon ke vidwaan jaise ki jaik goldstone, krantiyon ke sambandh main hue vidvattapurna shodh kaa vibhed chaar vartmaan pidiyon ke rup main karte hai
 First generation scholars such as Gustav Lee Baun, Charles A
 The method of Elwood or Pitirim Sorokin was predominantly descriptive, and the explanations they gave for the fact of revolutions were generally related to social psychology, such as Lee Baun's Crowd Psychology Theory
 duusari peedi ke siddhantvaadi krantiyon ke shuru hone ke kaarnon or samay ke bare main vistrut siddhant viksit karnaa chaahate the, joki adhik jatil saamaajik vyavhaar sambandhi siddhanton main nihit tha
 They can be divided into three major methods: psychological, sociological and political
 ted robert gur, evo ke
 ferebrand, roselind el
 ferebrand, james e
 geshvender, david si
 swaarthz or denton i
 morrison, pratham shrenee ke antargat aate hai
 He followed cognitive psychology and frustration-aggression theory and saw that the cause of the revolution is the mental state of the general public, while there was a difference of opinion among them as to what actually led people to rebel, all of them
 But agreed that the primary cause of the revolution was widespread frustration towards the socio-political state
 doosraa samooh, joki chalgers johnson, nil smelsar, bob jessoup, mark heart, edward e
 tiryakian, mark hagopian jaise shikshavidon ke dwaara bana tha, usne talcot parcens or samajashaastra kii sanrachanaatmak-prakriyaatmak siddhant kaa anusaran kiya; unhone dekha ki samaaj samgr rup se vibhinn sansadhano, maangon or uppranaaliyon ke madhya samyavastha main he
 As with all psychological ideologies, he differed with regard to the definition of the causes of imbalance, but he agreed that serious imbalance is responsible for the revolution
 antat tisare samooh, jisame charles tili, samuel pi
 hatington, peter amman or arthur el
 stincocombe jaise lekhak shaamil the, ne raajnneeti shaastra ke maarg kaa anusaran kiya or bahuwaadi siddhant va hit samooh sangharsh siddhant par nirbhar rahe
 These theories believe that these incidents are the result of a rights struggle between two competing interest groups
 is prakaar ke pratidarsh main, krantiyaan tab ghatit hoti hai jab do yaa do se adhik samooh saadhaaran nirnayaatmak prakriya main, joki kisi bhi raajnneetik pranali ke liye paaramparik he, sahamat nahin ho pate or saath hi saath unke paas apane lakshya ke anusaran hetu sena niyukti ke liye paryaapt sansaadhan uplabdh hote hai
 Second generation theorists saw that the development of revolutions is a dual process; First, some changes in the present state give results that are different from the results of the past; Second, the new state provides an opportunity for the revolution to occur
 aisi avasthaa main, ek ghatana joki bhootkaal main kranti karwaane ke liye paryaapt nahin thi, vahi ab iske liye paryaapt hoti he- haalanki yadi adhikari aise khataron ke prati sachet rahenge, to is avasthaa main bhi vah virodh ko roak sakate hai 
 Many early studies related to revolutions attempted to focus on four fundamental issues — the well-known and uncontroversial example that is indeed accurate for all definitions of revolutions, such as the Glorious Revolution, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Chinese Revolution
 haalanki, prasidd harvard itihaaskaar, kraine brinton ne apni prasidd pustak "da anatumi of rivolushan" main angreji grihayuddh, america kranti, francisi kranti or roosi kranti par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Over time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolution, and differences in their definitions and methods gave rise to new definitions and explanations
 duusari peedi ke siddhanton kii aalochana unke simit bhugolic prasar, anubhavik satyaapan kii kathinaaiyon or saath hi saath is aadhaar par kii gayi ki haalanki vah kuch vishesh krantiyon kaa spashtikaran detii hai lekin is baat ke liye koi spashtikaran nahin de paati ki inhi paristhitiyon main anya samaajon main vidroh kyun nahin hue
 The second generation of Alochhana led to the creation of a third generation of theories, including Theda Skoukpaul, Barrington Moore, Geoffrey Page and other authors who were expanding their focus on the basis of the ancient Marxist class struggle, focusing their attention on rural agrarian state struggle, State conflicts with upper-class people and domestic political change through inter-state economic and military competition
 Hne effects were focused on
 visheshtah scockpaul kii stats and soshal rivolushans teesri peedi kii sarvaadhik prachlit kritiyon main se ek ho gayi; scockpaul ne kranti kii vyakhya karte hue kaha "yah samaaj ke rajyon or varg sanrachana kaa teevr, moulik roopantaran he
 

which is supported and accepted by lower level class based rebellions "and he held the revolutions responsible for various conflicts related to the state, upper class and lower class
 1980 ke dashak ke antim varshon se vidvattapurna kaaryon ke ek nae nikaay ne teesri peedi ke siddhanton kii prabhavakaarita par prashn uthaane shuru kar die
 The old theories were also greatly shocked by the new revolutionary events which could not be expressed easily by them
 1979 main irani or rnikraguan krantiyaan, 1986 main philipinos main janashakti kranti or 1989 main europe main autom of neshans is baat ke gavaah bane ki ahimsak krantiyon main prasidd pradarshan evam jan hadtaal main kai shaktishaalee prathit hone vaale shasno ko bahu varg sanyog ne dhwast kar diya
 It was no longer enough to define revolution or rebellion as a European violent state versus a public or class struggle
 is prakaar krantiyon kaa adhyayan teen dishaao main viksit hua, pehla, kuch anusandhankarta kranti ke pichley yaa adhyatanikrut sanrachanaatmak siddhanton ko un ghatnaon ke sambandh main lagu kar rahe the jo purv main vishleshit nahin thim, adhikanshtah europea sangharsh
 doosraa, vidwaanon ke anusaar krantikari lamabandi va lakshyon ko vaicharik mat va samskruti ke rup main aakaar pradaan karne ke liye jaagruk sanstha ke prati or adhik dhyaan dene kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Third, analysts of both the revolutions and social movements felt that there was a lot in common between the two facts and that a new 'fourth generation' literature of conflicting politics developed which hoped to explain both facts in the social movements
 And tries to connect the fairies of both revolutions
 haalanki krantiyaan, communist kranti joki apekshaakrit shantipurna thi or jisane communist shashan kaa takhtapalat kar diya tha, se lekar afghanistan kii hinsak kranti ko bhi, kranti ke antargat samaveshit karti hai, par vah cops di'itats, grihayuddh, vidrohon or aise rajdroh ko kranti ke antargat shaamil nahin karti jo adhikaar ke pramanikaran yaa samaaj main roopantaran kaa koi prayaas nahin karte yaa america grihayuddh), saath hi saath sansthagat vyavasthaaon jaise, janamat sangrah yaa mukt chunaav, jaisaa ki spain main francisco franko kii mrityu ke baad hua tha, dwaara prajatantr kii ore shantipurna parivartan ko bhi vah kranti ke antargat sammilit nahin karatin
 There are many different classes of revolutions in social science and literature
 udhaaharan ke liye, pracheen vidwaan alexis di tocuvile ne 1) raajnneetik krantiyon or 2) aakasmik va hinsak krantiyaan joki naa sirf nae raajnneetik pranali kii sthapana karnaa chaahati hai balki puure samaaj ko roopantarit karnaa chaahati hai or 3) samgr samaaj kaa dhimaa kintu vyapak roopantaran jise puri tarah apane rup main aane main kai pidiyon kaa samay lag jaataa he main vibhed kiya
 One of the many different Marxist class sciences divides revolutions into pre-capitalism, early capitalist, capitalist, capitalist-democratic, early poor and social revolutions
 charles tili, kranti ke aadhunik vidwaan ne, ek takhtapalat, ek sarvadhikaar jabti, ek grihayuddh, ek vidroh or ek "mahaan kranti" ke madhya vibhed kiya he
 Other types of revolutions, which have been created for other class sciences, include social revolutions; Includes the proletariat or communist revolutions that are influenced by the ideas of Marxism and aim to transfer capitalism from communism); Failed or incomplete revolutions or violent versus non-violent revolutions
 "kranti" shabd kaa prayog raajnneetik kshetra se baahar ghatit hue vishaal parivartanon kii ore sanket karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Such revolutions are often recognized to bring more change in society, culture, philosophy and technology than in the political system, these are often known as social revolution
 kuch vaishvik ho sakati hai, jabaki anya ek hi desh tak simit hoti hai
 An ancient example of the use of the word revolution in this context is industrial revolution

 The Arab people are primarily associated with the Arabic language and culture although historically the definition of 'arab' has changed
 kuch kaalon main yah shabd keval badu logon ke liye prayog hua he jabaki anya kaalon main barbar log bhi isamen shaamil rahen hai
 If the most detailed definition of 'arab people' is taken, then their population is more than 300 million and according to some sources, this Han Chinese is the second largest human race in the world
 'arab' naam ke strot or arth ko lekar vidwaanon main vivaad he
 It is first of all found in an Akkadi language inscription of the 9th century BC which describes the Assyrian Empire occupying Syria after the 'karkar War'
 isamen asyria ke raja shalmanser tritiy kii faujon dwaara luti chizon main 'gindbu arab ke 1000 oont' bhi shaamil hai
 This Gindabu was the chieftain of the Arab faction in the Allies fighting against the Assyrians in this war
 'arab' naam kii utpatti kii sabase lokapriya kahani yah he ki yah ek 'yarab' naamak aadmi se aayaa he jo arabi bhashaa bolne vaala pehla vyakti tha
 al-hamdani, the ancient Arab intellectual, had a different opinion
 unka kahana tha ki kyonki arab log mesopotamia se pashchim main basate the, isliye unke liye 'garab' shabd istemaal hone laga, jiskaa arth arabi or anya sthaneey bhashaaon main 'pashchim' hota he
 This deteriorated into 'arab'
 ek anya pracheen arab itihaaskaar, al-masudi, kaa kahana tha ki shuru main yah naam 'arabah vaadi' ke nivaasiyon ke liye tha jo vistrut hokar puri jati ke liye prayog hone laga
 Although many people consider Arab identity to be the same as Muslim identity, in reality it is two different things
 bahut se arab isai hote hai or kuch yahudee bhi hote hai
 In present times 7% to 10% of the Arab people are followers of Christianity

 1767 isvi se 1833 isvi tak, 60 se zyada varshon main bhumij mundaaon dwaara angrejon ke viruddh kiye gaye vidroh ko bhumij vidroh kaha gaya he
 The British called it 'ganga Narayan's uproar' while historians have written it as the Chuad Rebellion

 For this, the British Government enacted a law to collect more revenue from the lands of the lands in places like Manbhum, Varabhum, Singhbhum, Dhalbhum, Patakram, Medinipur, Bankuda and Vardaman, etc
 Salt tax, the practice of liquor, the sale of land law, the arrival of Mahajan and ushers
 , Jungle law, land auction and dahmi practice, revenue collection succession rules

 Ganga Narayan Singh was the son of Lakshman Singh
 ganga narayan singh jangal mahal main garib kisaanon par shoshan, damankaaree sambandhi kanoon ke viruddh angrejon se badla lene ke liye katibaddh ho gaye
 By the call of time, the people of that area became alert and all united under the leadership of Ganga Narayan Singh and raised the slogan against the British
 unhone angrejon kii har niti ke bare main jangal mahal ke har jati ko samajhaayaa or ladane ke liye sangathit kiya
 Due to this, dissatisfaction increased in 1768 AD which took the form of a fierce struggle under the leadership of Ganga Narayan Singh in 1832 AD
 is sangharsh ko angrejon ne ganga narayan hangaamaa kahkar pukaara he or vahiin chuad vidroh naam se itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he
 Ganga Narayan Singh was the first hero to fight against the British rule and exploitation policy, who first formed the Sardar Gorilla Vahini
 jis par har jati kaa samarthan praapt tha
 The king-maharaja and landlords of Dhalbhum, Patakum, Shikharbhum, Singhbhum, Panchet, Jhalda, Kashipur, Vamani, Wagmundi, Manbhum, Ambika Nagar, Ameyapur, Shyamsunderpur, Phulkusma, Ranipur and Kashipur had the support of Ganga Narayan Singh
 ganga narayan singh ne varahabhum ke divaan tathaa angrej dalal madhav singh ko vanadih main 2 april, 1832 isvi ko akraman kar maar diya tha
 After that, he handed over the office of Varahbazar Muftasil, Salt Office of Salt and Police Station with Sardar Vahini
 bankura ke samahrta rasel, ganga narayan singh ko giraftaar karne pahunchaa
 But Sardar Vahini's army surrounded him all around
 sabhi angreji sena maari gayi
 But Russell somehow escaped Bankuda after saving his life
 ganga narayan singh kaa yah andolan tufaan kaa rup le liya tha, jo bengal ke chhaatna, jhalada, aakro, ambika nagar, shyamsundar, raipur, phulkusamaa, shilda, kuyilapal tathaa vibhinn sthanon main angrej regiment ko rond daalaa
 The impact of their movement was very strong in places like Purulia in Bengal, Vardhdman in Bankuda and Medinipur district, entire Chotanagpur in Bihar, Mayurbhanj, Keonkjhar and Sundargarh in Orissa
 falswaroop puraa jangal mahal angrejon ke kaabo se baahar ho gaya
 Everyone started supporting Ganga Narayan Singh as a true honest, brave, patriotic and social worker
 aakhirkaar angrejon ko barrackpore chhavnee se sena bhejnaa padaa jise leftinent karnal kapur ke netritv main bheja gaya
 The army was also defeated in the conflict
 iske baad ganga narayan or unke anuyaayiyon ne apni kaary yojana kaa dayera badhaa diya
 The commissioner's baton of Bardhaman and commissioner Hunt of Chotanagpur were also sent but they could not succeed and had to face defeat in front of Sardar Vahini's army
 agast 1832 se lekar farvari 1833 tak puraa jangal mahal bihar ke chotanagpur, bengal ke purulia, bankura ke vardhadman tathaa medinipur, urisa ke mayurbhanj, kyonkjhar or sundargarh ashaant bana rahaa
 The British tried in every way to suppress Ganga Narayan Singh but the British could not stand in front of Ganga Narayan Singh's cleverness and fighting skills
 vardhadman, chotanagpur tathaa urisa ke ayukta ganga narayan singh se parrast hokar apni jaan bachaakar bhaag nikle
 Thus, the struggle was so intense and effective that the British were forced to withdraw the land sale law, successor law, excise duty on lacquer, salt law, forest law
 us samay kharasaavaan ke thakur chetan singh angrejon ke saath saath-gaanth kar apana shashan chalaa rahaa tha
 Ganga Narayan Singh went to Podahat and Singhbhum Chaibasa and organized the Kol tribesmen there to fight against Thakur Chetan Singh and the British
 6 farvari, 1833 ko ganga narayan singh kol janajatiyon ko lekar kharasaavaan ke thakur chetan singh ke hindshahar thane par hamalaa kiya parantu durbhagyavash jivan ke antim saans tak angrejon evam hukumaton ke khilaaf sangharsh karte hue usee din veergati praapt kiye
 Thus on February 7, 1833, a powerful, powerful warrior who fought against the British, the Chuad rebellion, the hero of the Bhumij rebellion, Veer Ganga Narayan Singh, left his indelible mark and became immortal among us
