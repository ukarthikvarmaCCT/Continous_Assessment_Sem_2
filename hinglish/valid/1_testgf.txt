 Imtiaz Ali Arshi is a noted Urdu language writer
 inke dwaara rachit ek gaalib ke kavy kaa vivechanaatmak sampadan dewan–e–gaalib ke liye unhen san 1961 main sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Rigveda, the oldest available Hindu text, describes the priest
 usase prathit hota he ki us kaal main paurohitya ek vargvishesh ke haathon main tha jo devataaon kii krupa praapt karaane main madhyam kaa kaary karata tha
 The priests were mostly Brahmins
 inamen se bahut se raajaaon tathaa dhanimani vyaktiyon ke yahan dharmik krity karo ke liye niyukt rahete the
 He used to get a lot of donations and he and his families used to live on it
 yuddhadi prasangon main ye apane raajaaon kii sahaayta bhi karte the tathaa inhen praaia: vaidyak kaa bhi gyaan hota tha
 In the tenth section of the Rigveda, mantras are found regarding medicine
 yakshma, asananamrityu, santanprapti, shatrunash ityadi ke upachaaron kaa inamen varnan he
 Marriage, cremation of deceased etc
 were also covered under Porohitya
 isse spasht he ki us kaal main purohit kaa kaaryakshetra manushya ke dainandin jivan ko sparsh karne lag gaya tha
 Later Yajna, Yagadi works were also included in Porohitya
 rugveda main somyag kaa varnan he
 It required a large number of priests
 hotri, potru, prashastu, adhvaryu ityadi kaa kaary purohit hi kiya karte the
 Apart from these, there is also a description of Kulpurohit
 iskaa kaary raja ke kulachaar sampann karana hota tha
 During the Yagadi special Yagya also performed this work
 is prakaar ham yah dekhte hai ki vaidic kaal main purohit ko kaaphi mahatv praapt tha
 He used to be the worshiper of the gods and tried to get the blessings of the gods for the sacrifice through praise and sacrifice
 brahmanon main paurohitya ke sambandh main adhik vishad varnan miltaa he
 The period of Brahman literature dates back to the sixth century BCE
 is samay purohit ke kaaryakshetra kii ruparekha kaaphi spasht tathaa vishad ho chuki thi
 Different numbers of priests were required in different parts
 dainik agnihotra ke liye keval ek adhvaryu kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 Apart from Adhvaryu, 16 priests were needed for the Agnayadhaya and Agnidha, apart from Adhvaryu
 inamen brahma kaa mahatv sabase adhik hota tha
 There should not be any error in the Yajna work and the entire Yajna should be done in a systematic manner
 brahmankaal main purohit kaa mahatv kaaphi badha
 Now he started advising the king in his kingdom, tribunal etc
 shatruon kaa daman tathaa rajya kaa samrudh banane ke kaary bhi usne sanbhaale
 It is clear from the description of Aitareya Brahman that in that period the king was completely dependent on his priest
 devasur sangram main jab devataaon kii paraajay hone lagi thi to dev-purohit brihaspati ne hi use sanbhaala tha tathaa devataaon ko vijayshri praapt karai thim
 By this time, purohitya had become genetic
 purohit ko raja se bhi unchaa sthaan praapt tha
 He used to go there too and was welcomed with great respect
 use milanevaali daanadakshina kii koi seemaa nahin thi
 People used to donate even their entire property to the Yagnikas
 yah daan sarvshereshth mana jaataa tha
 The king also did not have authority over the property of a Brahmin
 brahmahatya sabase bada patak mana jaataa tha
 His atonement was only through Vajpayee Yajna
 lekin dhokheybaaj brahman ke log bardaasht nahin karte the
 The Panchvinsh Brahmin mentions that the deceived Brahmin was given the death penalty
 samaaj main brahman ko jo vishesh sthaan praapt tha uske badale main usase sadachaar, kartavyapaalan tathaa karmkand ke gyaan kii apeksha kii jaati thi
 The Upanishadic period begins from the sixth century BCE
 is samay tak purohit kaa kaaryakshetra spasht rup se nirdhaarit ho chukaa tha
 His work was different from sacrificial work
 vedadhyayan, yajna tathaa tapasya kaa sthaan gnanarjan tathaa adhyaapan ne le liya tha or isi prakaar is kaal main guru-shishy-parampara adhik sudrudh hone lag gai thi
 As a result, different traditions of philosophy and philosophy began to diverge from each other and differences of opinion began to arise
 buddha tathaa jain dharmo kii sthapana hui
 Purohitya had no place in them initially due to atheism in the pedestal of these religions
 lekin dhire dhire in dharmo ke avlamban karanevaalon ke liye aachaar or vyavhaaron ke niyam banane lage or bhinn prakaar ke hi sahi kintu ek vishesh prakaar ke varg kii inhen bhi aavashyaktaa hui jo logon ko unke kartavyakartavya kaa nirdesh de sake
 Thus Purohitya also started taking root in them
 iske baad ramayana, mahabharatadi kaavyon kii rachana kaa kaal aata he
 By this time the king had become completely dependent on the priest and did not do any work without his advice
 puraanon tathaa sanskrit sahitya main varnit purohit aadhunik kaal ke purohit ke samaan tha
 His scope was limited
 is kaal main paurohitya main upanayan, vivaahadi sanskaar karana, gram paurohitya arthath gramvaasiyon kii kundaliyaan bananaa, jutai bowai aadi krishimuhoort nikaalnaa, mandiron main pujari banakar rahanaa aadi kaary bhi sammilit hue
 Even in modern times, we see priests revered as priests in many temples
 sikhon ke gurudwaron main ham granthi ko dekhte hai
 They are also priests in a way
 aadhunik kaal main yajna yagadi kaa mahatv bahut hi kam ho chukaa he
 The class of Yajnikas is finished
 atev paurohitya main ab vaidic yagyadi ke sthaan par murtipuja, makarsankranti, vasantapanchami, holi, deepawali jaise dharmik utsavon ko sampann karana ityadi kaaryo ne pravesh praapt kar liya he
 Thus, in the present Hinduism, purohitya has been limited to various religious rites, worship of the gods, performing the rituals and religious festivals

 They are called Gyan Marg, Karm Marg and Bhakti Marg

 The term was not found in the Oxford Dictionary before the seventies
 par assi ke dashak main samir amin ke marxvaadi lekhan ne ise bauddhik jagat main aksar istemaal kii jane vaali avadharana main badal diya
 Ironically, the term coined by Marxist scholars is also used to criticize Marx's writings
 marks ko urocentric qaraar dene waalon kii kami nahin he
 Although it is difficult to find a concomitant urge of European superiority in Marx's writings, critics say that his understanding of world-history was based on European experience and that he could see the future of humanity as a reflection of the European model as a whole Used to see 1851 se hi duniya ke nakshon ke longitude meredian ke centre main greenvich, landan ko rakhaa janaa eurokendriyata kaa hi ek tathy he jise bina kisi saanskrithik aapatti ke sari duniya ne hazam kar liya he
 a notable example of Eurocentricity under post-colonial studies is the Mercator Atlas
 is atlas main europe kaa samshitoshna kshetra duusare kshetron ke mukaable kahin bade aakaar kaa dikhaaya gaya he
 In this atlas, the map of the world is not depicted only with objective lines showing different continents
 maanchitr main spes vichaardhaaratmak rup se moort kiya gaya he or isamen nakshe ke saath diye gayi paath or anya chitron kii madad bhi lee gayi he
 As a result, this map places Europe at the center of the world's spatial and cultural meanings
 edward said kii kriti 'orientlizam' main eurokendriyata kii kadi jaanch-padtaal kii gayi he
 Saeed says that this idea not only pushes towards making them like themselves by influencing other cultures, but imposes the West's dominance over them by placing them at a particular point in the realm of their experience
 said ke mutabik gyanoday ke baad se hi europee samskruti ne ek pranalibaddh anushaasan viksit kar liya he jiske auzaaron se vah purv kii duniya ko prabandhit karte hue gadhati he
 Eurocentricity is also confirmed through the discipline of literature-study, historiography and anthropology
 sahitya ke kshetra main iske pairokaron ne badi chaalaaki se apni dharanaon ko sahitya ke saarvbhaum kii tarah sthapit karne kii pariyojna chalaai
 Writing was done from the point of view of the winners in history
 maanavshaastra kii duniya main eurokendriyata ne swajativaadee aagrah ke rup main ghuspaith kii or gair-europee samskritiyon ko europee sabhyatamoolak maanakon ke barakes ‘aadim’ qaraar diya
 Some culture-critics believe that if Eurocentric thought was not already established, the earliest forms of anthropology would not have established such a close relationship with colonialism
 isiyat ke prachaar-prasar ke liye mishnariyon dwaara chalaayi jane vaali shaikshanik gatividhiyon main bhi eurokendriyata kii pushti karne kaa rujhaan rahata he
 It is for these reasons that non-european societies have so embodied Eurocentricity in the process of modernization that the idea of considering everything or work coming from the West as the best, on all the important fields like science, industry, mathematics, arts, entertainment and culture Has almost permanently dominated
 yahan tak ki eurokendriyata ke prati satark rahane vaale log bhi antat uske saath talmail baithaate hue paye jate hai
 Historically, the idea of european superiority was strengthened in the fifteenth century along with European imperialism
 vaigyanik kranti, vanijyik kranti or aupniveshik samrajyon ke vistaar ne aadhunik yug ke udai ke rup main swayan ko abhivyakti kiya
 It is considered as a period of 'european miracle' before which Europe could not be economically and technologically pitted against Ottoman Turkish, Mughal Empire of India and Ming Empire of China
 attharahavin or unnisvin sadi kii audyogic kranti or europee upniveshikaran kii duusari lahar ke saath hi yah avadharana apane charam par pahunch gayi
 European forces dominated trade and politics in the world
 pragativaad or udyogwaad ke aadhaar par tezi se viksit hui europee sabhyataa ko vishwa kaa saarvbhaum centre maanane waalon ne akhet, kheti or pashupaalan par aadhaarit samaajon ke prati tiraskaarpurn vimarsh rache
 It was only in the eighteenth century that European writers could be found comparing Europe and other continents of the world, saying that Europe is smaller in geographical area than others, but for different reasons it has a special position
 iske baad yah khaas sthiti europee reeti-rivaazon, shishtataa, vigyaan or kala main uski maharath kaa tark de kar paribhaashit kii jaati thi
 a question is also raised about Eurocentricity, whether this trend is not a variety of autism found in other parts of the world? Cultural superiority also arises among Chinese and Japanese
 'american sadi' kii daavedaariyaan bhi swajatvaad kaa hi ek namoona he
 But as soon as Eurocentricity is viewed with the perspective of colonialism, the idea starts to look like a distinct structure, different from normal autonomy
 eurokendriyata kii saakh main kshay kii shuruyaat bhi upniveshwaad virdohi andolanon ke jor pakadaney or dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad chali vi-upniveshikaran kii yugpravartak prakriya se hui
 Nationalist claims of local traditions and values made by the freedom movements challenged Western cultural ego

 Against Eurocentricity, colors were painted in multicenter pictures of world civilization

 Stage management is the practice of organizing and coordinating a dramatic production
 yah utpaadan ke aayojan or vibhinn karmiyon 
 Platform is a sub-discipline of management
 manch prabandhakon utpaadan vyavasthit karne main madad karne ke liye ek manch prabandhak kii pustak kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 The basic requirement of stage management is that it is able to keep everything in mind
 kab purvaabhyas karne aana he, kab baaki saar kaam karn he, har chheez k dhyaan rakhmana padt he
 This stage is a part of the craft
 apne manch prabandhan ke kitab ke maddad se insaan sab sambhal sakta he
 16 This was done by Logon in Chentury
 logon ko bahut kaam karn padt tha
 Every wear and tear was done and it was very difficult for them to do so
 isi kaaran se logon ne manch prabandhan shuru kiya
 The stage manager has to be good planners and organizers
 haalanki kai mashhoor logon ne manch prabandhakon ke saath kaam ho saktaa he, kaam hi nahin glamras, aksar lambey samay tak or kaaphi ubaau, dohraye kaaryon ke saath-saath shaareerik rup se maang kii ja rahi shaamil he
 During the rehearsal period, the stage management team serves as the development in the rehearsal room between the artistic process and the people physically creating, sewing, assembling and producing that rehearsal outside the room
 manch prabandhan par pratikul utpaadan ko prabhavit karne se kuch ko rokane ke liye kar rahe hai
 Attention is necessary here for detail and good communication skills
 manch prabandhan me alag alag jaghao k alag alag kaam hot he
 Some jughaos also include stage managers as well as deputy stage managers and assistant stage managers
 up manch prabandhak abhinaytaon sanket detaa he or aam taur par takneekee chaalak dal ke sadasyon kyuu jayega or kabhi kabhi, kalakaaron or nirdeshak manch prabandhak ke aadesh kaa paalan karte hue
 The deputy stage manager tells the actor to hold while technical problems are resolved during rehearsals, and determines where the script is
 up manch prabandhak rukaa ko punah aarambh karne main kuch cinemagharon main ek alag sthiti he, jabaki anya logon main up manch prabandhak kii jimmedaariyon manch prabandhak yaa sahaayak manch prabandhak dwaara grahan kiya ja saktaa he
 The sub-stage manager responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager, have varied
 unhone kaha ki lag rahaa he or reharsal ke dauraan rangamanch kii saamagree or sho ke ran banaae rakhane main madad karata he
 They may present or estimate audience size, backstage technicians can manage, act as a liaison between the crew, cast and management, and can say some signals
 aisi avasthaa or coffee yaa chaay pak ke rup main sansaarik kaaryon sahaayak manch prabandhak ke liye gir saktaa he
 If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the assistant manager must be able to fill in the stage
 roopak yaa feechar logon ko ruchikar lagane vaala aisa kathatmak lekh he jo haal ke hi samaacharon se judaa nahin hota balki vishesh log, sthaan, yaa ghatana par kendrit hota he
 Metaphors have great depth in terms of detail
 aaj feechar lekhan tathaa uske prastutikaran kaa aadhunik patrakarita main atyadhik mahatv ho gaya he
 If news is the backbone of journalism, then the beauty enhancing power of feature journalism
 patrakarita main samachar jahaan taatkaalik ghatnaon kaa tatthypurna abhilekh hota he to roopak yani feechar samachar ke tatkaal swaroop se alag uskaa vistaar, uskaa sachitr prastutikaran yaa usase jude sampoorn ghatnakram kaa vivaran prastut karata he
 Due to the lack of space in modern journalism, the limit of words in news writing has been fixed and a journalist has to say everything in the same word limit
 aise main feechar, patrkaar ke liye ek madadgaar ke taur par kaam karata he
 a lot can be said, written or presented in a very small space through graphics, pictures, sketches and brief presentations in the feature
 roopak kaa vikaas vivarnaatmak rachanaaon se hua he lekin shabdon or sthaan kii seemaa ke chalate ab feechar bhi sankshipt hone lage hai
 Although brief, the feature's importance has not diminished but rather increased
 feechar main samachar ke vistaar ko hi ek vishesh takanic ke saath prastut kiya jaataa he
 For this, the feature writer has to find out who is the main subject or main character of the news
 What are the key elements associated with the main topic of the news? Le Khak also has to give a personal touch to it while presenting this lesson
 maanviya bhaawanaaon ke sparsh ke saath-saath manoranjak dhang se prastut feechar adhik lokapriy hote he kyonki unase vishay ke sampoorn tatthyon kii jaankaree ke saath-saath pathak, shrota yaa darshak kaa manoranjan bhihota he
 News ends by giving a description and consideration of the facts, while the feature describes the environment of the event or topic, various aspects and its effects
 samachar main likhane vaale ke vichaar athwa uske vyaktitv kii jhalak nahin hoti jabaki feechar main lekhak kii vichaardhaara, uski kalpanashiltaa ke saath-saath uske vyaktitv kii bhi jhalak milti he
 The feature has the primacy of the narrative element, meaning that there is both ease and fluency in its writing or presentation
 lekin feechar mahaj katha nahin hota
 The feature works to soothe the curiosity of the readers by delving deeper into the subject rather than getting lost in the imaginary things
 feechar lekhan ek kalatmak kaam he or kisi bhi patrkaar ko acha feechar lekhak banane ke liye - Feature is a mode of presentation of news, but compared to news, the feature explains the subject through in-depth study, pictures, research and interviews
 uskaa vistrut prastutikaran hotahai or yah sab kuch itane sahaj or rochak dhang se hota he ki pathak uske bahaav main bandhata chalaa jaataa he
 Scholars of journalism and literature have coined different definitions of metaphor
 ek paribhaasha ke anusaar, By another definition, ek anya paribhaasha main to feechar ko 'samachar patr kii aatma' kah diya gaya he
 In general terms, the news work is finished by giving elements and ideas
 jabaki feechar kaa kaam isse aage kaa hota he
 It reveals the background of the news, details the birth and development of the subject or event
 yah vishay athwa ghatana kaa puraa khulaasa bhi karte hai or pathak ko kuch sochane ke liye bhi vivash karte hai
 The significance of a good feature is in how much it affects the minds and minds of its readers
 feechar lekhak ghatana yaa vishay ke bare main apni pratikriya yaa vichaar bhi pathak ko batalaata he or is tarah pathak kii kalpana shakti ko or uski vaicharik manahosthiti ko bhi prabhavit karata he
 The importance of the feature lies in how it goes beyond the news that clarifies the when, why, how, where and who it leaves a special impact through the balanced presentation of the concept and idea
 feechar kaa ek mahatv yah bhi he ki yah pathak ke man main kisi khabar ko padhane ke baad paidaa hui jigyaasa ko bhi santusht karata he
 Nowadays the use of features in newspapers is increasing day by day
 europe main jari jabardast sardi or himpat par bhartiya bhashaai akhabaaron main vistrut samaacharon ke liye sthanbhav ho saktaa he
 But by presenting the same subject in a small space through an illustrated feature, newspapers can also overcome their problem of relocation and the reader gets complete information about the snow-fed Europe
 isi tarah kisi sthaneey durghatana ke samachar ke saath-saath agar us tarahaki anya ghatnaon kaa vivaran, rokthaam ke upayon, prabhaviton ke anubhav aadi ek sachitr feechar ke rup main prastut kar diya jaataa he to isse pathak ko sampoorn jaankaree ek saath mil jaati he
 This use of the feature has greatly enhanced the importance of the feature today
 is badhate mahatv ke kaaran feechar lekhan bhi ab patrakarita kii ek mahatvapurn vidha ho gai he
 Along with this, the importance of feature writers is also increasing
 aaj samachar patron main feechar desk kaa mahatv bhi bad gaya he or unki upyogita bhi
 In newspapers, due to the feature, more attention is being given to better presentation and urgency
 kai bade akhbaar samoohon main ab kendriyakrut feechar lekhan vyavastha bhi shuru ho gai he jiske tahat mahatvapurn vishyon par feechar taiyaar kar akhbaar ke sabhi sanskarnon ke liye bhej die jate hai
 The wonders of the Internet and information technology have made feature writing easier today
 lekin inhen chamatkaaron ke kaaran aaj feechar lekhan ke kshetra main nai chunautiyaan bhi khadi ho gai he
 Today, the feature writer has to pay maximum attention to the fact that all the elements in its feature are perfect, fresh, expedient and they can solve all the curiosities of the reader
 feechar, patrakarita kii ek aisi vidha he jisamen lekhan ko niyamon kii kisi khaas seemaa main nahin baandha ja saktaa
 Feature writing is very popular in developed countries as a genre of journalism
 chunki bharat main patrakarita kaa janm or vikaas raajnneeti ke saath hua he isliye yahan feechar kii vikaas yatra apekshaakrit der se shuru hui
 Here pen was used as a sword in early journalism
 aazaadee ke baad ke varsho main or vishesh rup se apatkaal ke baad ke varsho main akhabaaron ne raajnneeti se itar jivan ke vrihattar ayaamon kikhoj karne or jivan ko uski samagrata main dekhne samajhane kaa kaam tej kar diya tha
 Due to this, a distinct style of feature writing developed in our country
 printing technology main aae krantikari parivartanon ne feechar lekhan kii upyogita, jarurat or mahatv teenon ko dwiguneet kar diya he
 The main rule of feature creation is that the feature should be attractive, realistic and entertaining
 vartmaan main feechar ke liye kisi khaas prakaar kaa le aaut, saaj sajja, aakaar-prakaar yaa shabd seemaa kaa bandhan nahin rah gaya he
 Today, feature creation is being considered more important, at least in words
 isi tarah ab ek vishay par ek badi rachana ke bajaay ek saath choti-choti kai soochnaaon-samagriyon ko prastut karke bhi feechar likhe jane lage hai
 Broadly, 5 main things are kept in mind for feature writing- feechar lekhan ek kala bhi he or ab jabaki feechar kaa swaroop badal rahaa he to feechar lekhan kii takanic or tareeke bhi badal rahen hai
 Currently the feature is changing its traditional styles and definitions and changing the new forms

 Prithviraj Chauhan's sharp eyes on the expansion and order of his empire were always frozen
 ab unki ichha punjab tak vistaar karne kii thi
 But at that time, Punjab was ruled by Mohammad Ghauri
 1190 i0 tak sampoorn punjab par mohammad gauri kaa adhikaar ho chukaa tha
 Now he used to run his rule from Bhatinda
 prithviraj yah baat bhalee bhaanti jaanata tha ki mohammad gauri se yuddh kiye bina punjab main chouhan samrajya sthapit karnaa asambhav tha
 Considering this, he decided to deal with Gauri
 apane is nirnay ko moort rup dene ke liye prithviraj ek vishaal sena lekar punjab kii or ravaanaa ho gaya
 Taking swift action, he took possession of the forts of Hansi, Saraswati and Sirhind
 isi bich use soochna mili ki anhilwara main vidrohiyon ne unke viruddh vidroh kar diya he
 From Punjab, he moved to Anheelwada
 unke peeth peeche gauri ne akraman karke sarhind ke kile ko pun: apane kabje main le liya
 Prithviraj soon crushed the revolt of Anahilvada
 ab usne gauri se nirnaayak yuddh karne kaa nirnay liya
 He equipped his army in a new way and went to war
 raavi nadi ke tat par prithviraj ke senapati khet singh khangaar kii sena main bhayankar yuddh hua parantu kuch parinaam nahin niklaa
 Seeing this, Prithviraj proceeded to teach Gauri a lesson
 thaneshwar se 14 mile dur or sarhind ke kile ke paas tarin naamak sthaan par yah yuddh ladaa gaya
 In this first war of Tarain, the Rajputs delivered sixes of Gauri's army

 raja jayachand ke deshadroh kaa parinaam yah hua kii jo mohammad gauri tarin ke yuddh main apni haar ko bhula nahin paaya tha, vah phir prithviraj kaa muqaabala karne ke shadyantra karne laga
 King Jaichand sent messengers and assured them of military assistance to Gauri
 deshadrohi jayachand kii sahaayta paa kar gauri turant prithviraj se badla lene ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 When Prithviraj got the information that Gauri was once again busy in the preparations for war, then he had no effect
 mohammad gauri kii sena se mukaabal karne ke liye prithviraj ke mitra or raaj kavi chandbardaai ne anek rajput raajaaon se sainya sahaayta kaa anurodh kiya parantu sanyogita ke haran ke kaaran bahut se rajput raja prithviraj ke virdohi ban chuke the ve kannauj naresh ke sanket par gauri ke paksh main yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 In 1192, once again Prithviraj and Gauri's army stood face to face in the battle of Tarain
 donon or se bheeshan yuddh shuru ho gaya
 In this war, 3 lakh soldiers from Prithviraj participated while Gauri had one lakh twenty thousand soldiers
 gauri kii sena kii vishesh baat ye thi kii uske paas shaktishaalee ghudsavaar dasta tha
 Prithviraj aggressively attacked Gauri's army
 us samay bhartiya sena main hathi ke dwaara sainya prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Gauri's horsemen went ahead and surrounded the elephants of the Rajput army and started raining arrows on them
 ghayal hathi na to aage bad paae or na peeche balki unhone ghabara kar apni hi sena ko rondana shuru kar diya
 The biggest tragedy of Tarain's Second War was that Rajput soldiers were killing their Rajput brothers at the behest of the traitor Jayachand
 doosraa prithviraj kii sena raat ke samay akraman nahin karti thi lekin turk sainik raat ko bhi akraman karke markat machaa rahe the
 As a result, Prithviraj was defeated in this war and he and Raj Kavi Chandbardai were taken captive
 deshadrohi jayachand kaa isse bhi bura haal hua, usko maar kar kannauj par adhikaar kar liya gaya
 With the defeat of Prithviraj, Gauri became the authority over Delhi, Kannauj, Ajmer, Punjab and entire India
 bharat main islamic rajya sthapit ho gaya
 Gauri, Prithviraj and Chandbardai went to their home state Gaur as prisoners of war, making their worthy commander Qutbuddin Aibak as governor of India
 ghanaanand reetikaal kii teen pramukh kavyadharaon- reetibaddh, ritisiddh or reetimukt ke antim kavyadhara ke agrani kavi hai
 These 'anandaghan' names are also famous

 1746 tak mana he
 Thus Ghanananda is the joy of Vrindavan
 shukla ji ke vichaar main ye nadirshah ke akraman ke samay maare gaye
 He also gets the opinion of Shri Hazariprasad Dwivedi
 lagata he, kavi kaa mul naam anandaghan hi rahaa hoga, parantu chhandatmak lay-vidhaan ityadi ke kaaran ye swayan hi anandaghan se ghananand ho gaye
 Most scholars consider Ghananand to be born in and around Delhi

 aarambhik jivan dilli tathaa uttar jivan vrundavan main beetaa
 There were Kayasthas of caste
 sahitya or sangeet donon main inaki asaadhaaran gati thi
 It is said that he was a Mirmunshi in the court of Shahshah Muhammad Shah Rungile and was obsessed with a dancer named 'sujan'
 ek din darbariyon ne badshaah se kah diya ki munshi ji gaate bahut acha hai
 He caught the stubbornness of his song
 par ye gaanaa sunaane main apni ashakti kaa hi nivedan karte rahe
 In the end, the emperor was told that if Sujan was called, he would recite these songs
 vah bulaai gai or inhone uski ore unmukh hokar sachmuch gaaya or aisa gaaya ki sara darbar mantrmugdh ho gaya
 The emperor expelled them from Delhi for disobeying the orders
 sujan ne inkaa saath nahin diya
 From there he went to Vrindavan and took initiation from Nimbarka Sampradayacharya Shrivrindavanadeva
 inkaa sakhibhavsuchak naam 'bahuguni' tha
 She was initiated into the Nimbarka sect in Vrindavan, becoming enamored with Lord Krishna and also abandoned her family's fascination because of that devotion
 marate dam tak ve radha-krishna sambandhi geet, kavitt-savaiye likhte rahe
 Poet Ghananand was Mir Munshi of the Emperor Muhammad Shah of Delhi
 kehete hai ki sujan naam kii ek stri se unka atoot prem tha
 Due to his love, Ghanananda sat in the court of the king disrespectfully, due to which the emperor removed him from the court
 saath hi ghanaanand ko sujan kii bevafaayee ne bhi niraash or dukhi kiya
 He went to Vrindavan and was initiated into the Nimbarka sect and started living as a devotee
 parantu ve sujan ko bhul nahin paae or apni rachanaaon main sujan ke naam kaa pratikatmak prayog karte hue kavy-rachana karte rahe
 Ghanananda is basically a poet of the pain of love
 viyog varnan main unka man adhik rama he
 They crossed the path of love and reached the ranks of great seekers
 yamuna ke kachhaaron or braj kii vithiyon main bhraman karte samay ye kabhi anandatirek main hansane lagate or kabhi bhavavesh main ashru kii dhara inke netron se pravaahit hone lagati
 Great Mahatmas like Nagaridas respected him very much

 His contemporary Vrajnath had collected 500 of his poetic works
 inke kabitt kaa yah sabase pracheen sangrah he
 At the beginning, two and six total eight verses were written by Vrajnath himself in his praise
 puri 'daanagata' 'ghananand kabitt' main sankhya 402 se 414 tak sangruhit he
 In the Paramhansa dynasty, he mentions the guru tradition
 inaki likhi ek farsi masanvi bhi batalaai jaati he par vah abhi tak uplabdh nahin he
 Ghanananda Bibliography compiles 16 of his works
 ghanaanand ke naam se lagbhag chaar hajaar kii sankhya main kavitt or savaiye milten hai
 His most popular work is 'sujan Hit', which has 507 posts
 in main sujan ke prem, rup, virah aadi kaa varnan hua he
 Sujan Sagar, Virah Leela, Kripakand Essay, Rasakeli Valli etc
 are prominent
 unki anek rachanaaon kaa angrezi anuwaad bhi ho chukaa he
 Ghananand appears to be the most literary writer among the major actors of the medieval wayward stream of Hindi
 inaki rachana ke do prakaar hai : ek main premsamvednaa k abhivyakti he, or duusare main bhakthisamvednaa kii vyakti
 Their composition is less in the eloquent form of the Abhidha, more in the satire form of the goal and symptom of the symptom
 ye bhashapraveen bhi the or vrajabhashapraveen bhi
 On the basis of Vrajbhasha's experiments he has organized the new Vagyog
 unki rachanaaon main prem kaa atyant gambhir, nirmal, aavegamay or vyakul kar dene vaala udaatt rup vyakt hua he, isiilie ghanaanand ko 'saakshaat rasmurti' kaha gaya he
 Ghanananda's poetry has the same depth of emotion as it is in the art
 unki kavita main lakshanikta, vakrokti, vagvidagdhta ke saath alankaaron kaa kushal prayog bhi miltaa he
 There is a wonderful combination of effort and curvature in his poetic art
 ghanaanand kii bhashaa parishkrut or saahitiyik brajabhasha he
 It shows extreme development of tenderness and sweetness
 bhashaa kii vyanjaktaa badhaane main ve atyant kushal the
 In fact, he was not only proficient in Brajbhasha, but also the creator of creative poetry
 ghanaanand bhashaa ke dhani the
 He has used Brajbhasha in his poetry
 reetikaal kii yahi pramukh bhashaa thi
 His Braj Bhasha is rich in words from Arabic, Persian, Rajasthani, Khadi dialect etc
 unhone saral-sahaj lakshanik vyanjanapurna bhashaa kaa prayog kiya he
 Ghanananda has added language beauty to the use of proverbs and idioms
 ghanaanand ne apane kavy main alankaaro kaa prayog atyant sahaj dhang se kiya he
 In poetry, allusions, puns, metaphors, metaphors, catalysis and contradiction etc
 have been used with plurality
 'virodhabhas ' ghanaanand kaa priy alankar he
 Acharya Vishwanath has written about him- chand-vidhaan kii drushti se ghanaanand ne kavitt or savaiye hi adhik likhe hai
 By the way, he has also written couplets and quadrupeds
 ras kii drushti se ghanaanand kaa kavy mukhyatah shringaar ras pradhan he
 Discontinuation is the predominance of them
 kahin-kahin shant ras kaa prayog bhi dekhte banataa he
 Ghanananda also has the qualities of pictorialism and eloquence in the language
 in padon main sujan ke prem rup virah aadi kaa varnan hua he Ghanananda describes the heroine Sujan very fondly
 ve us par apana sarvasv nyochaavar kar dete hai Ghanananda describes the path of love as very simple, there is no curvature anywhere
 kavi apni priya ko atyadhik chaturaai dikhaane ke liye ulaahna bhi detaa he
 The poet also sends a love letter to his beloved, but that ruthless person has not even read it
 rup saundarya kaa varnan karne main kavi ghanaanand kaa koi sani nahin he
 He becomes frantic after seeing his heroine in a black sari
 saawanri sari ne sujan ke gore sareer ko kitna kantimaan bana diya hai
 a major feature of Ghanananda's poetry is the natural curvature of expression corresponding to sentiment
 ghanaanand kaa prem loukik prem kii bhav bhoomi se upar uthakar alokik prem kii bulandiyon ko chhutaa hua najar aata he, tab kavi kii priyasujan hi parabrahm kaa rup ban jaati he
 In such a situation, Ghanananda rises above love and becomes a devotee
 bahut dinaan ko avadhi aasapaas pare, khare arbarni bhare hai uthi jaan ko
 Wherever i am awakened, i feel sad, i am not sad, i am no longer surrounded by joy
 adhar lage hai aani kari kai payaan praan, chahat chalan ye sandeson lai sujan ko
