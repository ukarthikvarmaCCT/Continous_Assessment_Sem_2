 It was built by Swami Haridas in 1864
 shridham vrindavan, yah ek aisi paavan bhoomi he, jis bhoomi par aane maatr se hi sabhi paapon kaa naash ho jaataa he
 After all, who will be the person who does not want to come to this holy land and will not want to show himself to Shri Bankebihari Ji
 yah mandir shri vrindavan dham ke ek sundar ilaake main sthit he
 It is said that this temple was built around the year 1921 with the collective efforts of the descendants of Swami Shri Haridas ji
 mandir nirmaan ke shuruuaat main kisi daan-daata kaa dhan isamen nahin lagaaya gaya
 Shriharidas Swami was a nostalgic Vaishnava subject
 unke bhajan–kirthan se prasann ho nidhivan se shri bankebihariji prakat huye the
 Swami Haridas ji was born in the village of Rajapur near Vrindavan on the eighth day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada month in Samvat 1536
 inke aradhyadev shyaam–saloni surat baale shribankebihari ji the
 His father's name was Gangadhar and mother's name was Mrs
 Chitra Devi
 haridas ji, swami aashudhir dev ji ke shishy the
 On seeing this, Ashudhir Devji knew that he is the incarnation of Sakhi Lalitaji and on the day of Radhaashtami, the devotion of Bhakti Pradhani Shri Radha ji's festival of Mangal Mahotsav is here for the benefit
 haridasji ko rasanidhi sakhi kaa avatar mana gaya he
 He used to be bored with the world since childhood
 kishoravastha main inhone aashudhir ji se yugal mantra diksha lee tathaa yamuna sameep nikunj main ekaant sthaan par jaakar dhyaan-magn rahane lage
 When he was 25 years old, he received illusions from his Guru and away from the world, was left to contemplate Nikunj Bihari's daily pastimes
 nikunj van main hi swami haridasji ko bihariji kii murti nikaalane kaa swapnadesh hua tha
 Then according to his ignorance, Shree Vigraha, having the image of Manohar Shyamvarna, was taken out of the lap
 yahi sundar murti jag main shribankebihari ji ke naam se vikhyath hui yah murti margshirsh, shukla ke panchami tithi ko nikaala gaya tha
 Therefore, we treat Prakatya Tithi as Vihara Panchami with great enthusiasm
 yugal kishor sarkaar kii murti radha krishna kii sanyukt chhavi yaa aikikrut chhavi ke kaaran banke bihari ji ke chhavi ke madhya ack alokik prakaash kii anubhuti hoti he,jo banke bihari ji main radha tatv kaa parichaayak he
 Swami Haridas shri bankebihari ji nidhivan main hi bahut samay tak swami ji dwaara sevit hote rahe the
 Then when the construction of the temple was completed, then they were brought there and installed
 sanay vansh paramparaagat shrikrishna yeti ji, bihari ji ke bhoga evam anya seva vyavastha sambhaale rahe
 Then he appointed Hargulal Seth ji in Samvat 1975 to take care of the service system of Sribihari ji
 tab is seth ne veri, kolkata, rohtak, ityadi sthanon par shribankebihari treston kii sthapana kii
 Apart from this, the cooperation of other devotees is also helping in this
 anand kaa vishay he ki jab kaala pahaad ke utpaat kii ashanka se anekon vigrah sthaanantarit hue
 But Sribankevihari did not transfer from here
 aaj bhi unki yahaan prem sahit puja chal rahi hai
 Later, by changing Swami Haridas ji's worship system, a new sect, independent of the Nimbarka sect, became a Sakhibhava sect
 isi paddati anusaar vrindavan ke sabhi mandiron main seva evam mahotsav aadi manaaye jate hai
 Shri Sreebakebihari ji is ordained in the temple of Shri Sreebakebihari only on the day of Sharad Purnima
 keval shraavan teej ke din hi thakur ji jhule par baithte hai evam janmashtami ke din hi keval unki mangala–aarti hoti hai
 Whose fortunes are received only by a fortunate person
 or charan darshan keval akshay tritiya ke din hi hota he
 The raft of those who see these stage-lotuses is overcome
 swami haridas ji sangeet ke prasiddh gayak evam tansen ke guru the
 One morning Swamiji started seeing that someone was sleeping on his bed with a quilt
 yah dekhakar swami ji bole– are mere bistar par koun so rahaa hai
 Sreebihari ji himself was sleeping there
 shabd sunate hi bihari ji nikal bhaage
 But they left their chudas and wanshi on the bed
 swami ji, vruddh avasthaa main drushti jeern hone ke kaaran unakon kuch najar nahin aay
 After this, when the priest of Shri Bankebihariji temple opened the doors of the temple, when the priest of Shri Bankevihariji temple opened the doors of the temple, he could not see the sarcasm and wiggle in the face of shribankebihari Ji
 kintu mandir kaa darwaja band tha
 Surprised, the priest came to Swamiji at Nidhivan and told Swamiji all the things
 swami ji bole ki praatavkaal koi mere panlag par soya hua tha
 He has left something while leaving
 tab pujari ji ne pratyaksh dekha ki panlag par shribankebihari ji kii chuda–vanshi virajman hai
 This proves that Sribankebihari ji goes to Nidivan to do raas at night
 isi kaaran se praatah shribihari ji kii mangala–aarti nahin hoti hai
 Reason- Bihari ji comes here after night
 atah praatah shayan main baadha daalkar unki aarti karnaa aparaadh hai
 Many emperors used to come here to get the darshan of Swami Haridas ji
 ek baar dilli ke samraat akbar, swami ji ke darshan hetu yahan aaye the
 The darshan of Thakur ji is from 9 am to 12 noon and from 6 pm to 9 pm
 vishesh tithi uplakshyanusaar samay ke parivartan kar diya jaataa hai
 There are many stories in relation to the philosophy of Sribakebihari Ji
 jinamein se ek tathaa do nimnlikhit hai– ek baar ek bhaktimati ne apane pati ko bahut anunay–vinay ke pashchaat vrindavan jane ke liye raji kiya
 Both came to Vrindavan to see Sribakebihari ji
 kuch din shribihari ji ke darshan karne ke pashchaat uske pati ne jab swagrih waapas lautne ki cheshtaa kii to bhaktimati ne shribihari ji darshan laabh se vanchit hona padegaa, aisa sochakar wo rone lagi
 The world will go to heaven for bondage, so she starts crying near Sribihari ji, "O Lord, i am going home, but you stay with me forever, after praying, both of them will go towards the railway station
" Sitting in a horse cart walked
 us samay shribankevihari ji ek gop balak kaa rup dhaaran kar ghodagadee ke peeche aakar unako saath lekar le jane ke liye bhaktimati se prarthana karne lage
 Here, the priest not knowing Thakur ji in the temple, he came to know about the love incident of Bhaktimati and immediately he ran behind the horse cart
 gaadi main balak rupi shribankebihari ji se prarthana karne lage
 While having such a conversation between the two, that child disappeared from their midst
 tab pujari ji mandir lautakar pun shribankebihari ji ke darshan karne lage
 Here, both the devotee and Bhaktimati, knowing the kindness of Sribakebihari himself, both gave up their movement of the world and dedicated their lives at the feet of Sribakebihari
 aise hi anekon kaaran se shribankebihari ji ke jhalak darshan arthath jhaanki darshan hote hai
 There is a curtain on the front door of the temple Shri Sibihari and that curtain is closed and opened at an interval of two minutes and there is another legend
 ek baar ek bhakt dekhtaa rahaa ki uski bhakthi ke vasheebhoot hokar shribankebihari ji bhaag gayi
 When the priest opened the doors of the temple, he did not see shribankebihari
 pataa chalaa ki ve apane ek bhakt kii gavaahi dene aligarh chale gayi hai
 Since then it has been made such a rule that the curtain of Thakur ji will be opened and closed in Jhalak Darshan
 aisi hi bahut sari kahaniyaan prachlit he
 Sribakebihari Ji appeared from Swami Haridasji from Visakha Kund located in Nidivan
 is mandir main krishna ke saath shriradhika vigrah kii sthapana nahin hui
 On the Akshaya Tritiya of Vaishakh month, Sree Charanchas of Sribakebihari are seen
 pehle ye nidhivan main hi virajman the
 Later visited the present temple
 yawanon ke updrav ke samay shribankebihari ji gupt rup se vrindavan main hi rahe, baahar nahin gayi
 Sribakebihari ji has a special tableau philosophy
 yahan jhaanki darshan kaa kaaran unka bhaktavatsalya evam rasikata he
 At one time a devout nobleman appeared for his darshan
 ve bahut der tak ek-tak se inhen nihaarte rahe
 Rasik Bankebihari ji looked at them and went with them to his village
 baad main bihari ji ke goswamiyon ko pataa lagane par unka peechha kiya or bahut anunay-vinay kar thakurji ko lautaa-kar shrimandir main padhraya
 Therefore, a tableau philosophy of Bihari ji was arranged so that no one could fight his eyes
 yahan ek vilakshan baat yah he ki yahan mangal aarti nahin hoti
 The Gosaias here say that Thakurji sleeps at night in the morning, tired at night
 us samay inhen jagaanaa uchit nahin he
 The faith of the people is so much that one of the devotees who came to see the last Ashwin Shukla Panchami, who could not see anything with eyes, just inquired Baba that you are unable to see, yet have come to see Bihari ji
 unhone uttar diya lala mujhe nahin dikhataa he,par bihari ji mujhe dekh rahe hai
