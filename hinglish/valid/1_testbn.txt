 Even after three decades, the Congress's difficulties in the 1984 anti-sikh riots are not taking its name
 34 saal ke baad is maamle main dilli hai court kii dabl bench ne somvaar ko nichali adaalat ke faisle ko palatate hue sajjan kumaar ko dange ke liye doshi mana or umrakaid kii sajaa de di
 Let us tell you that in the riots that took place after the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984, 3325 people were killed
 inamen se 2733 sirf dilli main maare gaye the
 While the rest were killed in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra
 sajjan kumaar ko dilli ke kaint ilaake main aapraadhik shadyantra rachane, hinsa karaane or danga bhadakaane kaa doshi paaya gaya he
 Earlier, in the 1984 Sikh riot case, in 2013, Congress leader Sajjan Kumar was acquitted by the trial court, while the other accused besides Sajjan Kumar were convicted by the court
 isamen purv congress parshad balavaan khokhar, captain bhaagamal, girdhaari laal or do anya log shaamil the
 The court in its order held them guilty of inciting a riot and sentenced former Congress councilors Balwan Khokhar, Bhagmal and Girdhari Lal to life imprisonment, while former mlas Mahendra Yadav and Kishan Khokhar were sentenced to three years of imprisonment each
 
 nichali adaalat ke is faisle ko doshiyon ne dilli hai court main chunauti di thi
 Apart from this, the CBI and the victims also filed an appeal in the High Court against the lower court's decision to acquit Congress leader Sajjan Kumar and accused all the culprits, including Sajjan Kumar, that these people were behind the rioting
 sajjan kumaar ke baad dilli ke duusare bade netaa congress netaa jagadish titalar bhi aarope lage hai, un par dilli ke bulabangash ilaake main gurudwara ke saamne 3 sikhon kii hatya karne kaa aarope laga tha
 However, the CBI could not confirm the allegations against Tytler yet
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki sajjan kumaar kii sajaa ke baad kya jagadish titalar kii mushkilen bhi badhengi
 Due to the riots of 84, the political future of some Congress leaders has completely come to an end
 inamen jagadish titalar, sajjan kumaar samet kuch duusare netaaon kaa bhi naam shaamil he
 Kamal Nath's name was also revealed in 2010 regarding his involvement in these riots
 unka yah naam dilli ke gurudwara rakabganj main hui hinsa main saamne aayaa tha
 He was also accused that if he had come to protect the gurdwara, then why did he not help the Sikhs who were under fire
 vahaan par unki maujuudagi kaa zikr police record main bhi kiya gaya or in dangon kii jaanch ko bane nanavati ayog ke saamne ek peedit ne apane halafname main bhi unka naam liya tha
 Stains are deep on the Congress, however, these riots are very deep on the Congress
 rahul gandhi bhale hi in dangon main congress kii sanliptata se saaf inkaar kar rahe hai lekin aapako bataa den ki dangon ke 21 saal baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne sansad main iske liye maafee maang chuke hai
 He said that whatever happened, his head bowed with shame
 in dangon kii tapish ko aaj tak sikh mahasoos karte hai
 This is the reason that in April this year, when Rahul Gandhi fasted at Rajghat in protest against the Center, there was a strong protest against the presence of Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar
 is virodh ke chalate hi in donon netaaon ko vahaan se hataanaa padaa tha
 Many leaders find themselves very uncomfortable about these riots within the Congress itself
 aaropon se nahin batch sake narsimha ravapako yahaan par ye bhi bataa den ki in dangon kii aanch or aaropon se purv pradhanmantri narsimha raav bhi khud ko nahin bachaa sake the
 He was the Union Home Minister at the time of the 1984 riots
 us vakt unke upar in dangon ko rokane main laaparvaahee baratane ke aarope lage the
 Rajiv Gandhi's statement on the riots, although the statement made by the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on these riots in public, could not be embraced even today
 19 november, 1984 ko unhone boat club main ikattha hui bheed ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki jab indira ji kii hatya hui thi, to hamaare desh main kuch dange-fasaad hue the
 We know how angry the people of India were, how angry they felt and for some days people felt that India was shaking
 jab bhi koi bada ped girtaa he to dharti thodi hilti he
 'this statement was used by his opponents in his favor

 The Kings XI team, which scored above 190 six times in the IPL-7, could not cross the total of 150 three times against Knight Riders
 pehle qualifire match main bhi nite rides ke gendbaajon ke aage unke ballebaaj dam todate najar aae
 Kings xi's United Arab Emirates stage of IPL-7 was a huge success, and they won all their five matches there
 duusari ore vatan vaapasi ke saath hi nite rides ne jabardast vaapasi karte hue lagaataar aath jeet darj kar final tak kaa rasta tay kiya
 Ace of Kings XI in Arabia, Glenn Maxwell's performance at the Indian grounds has been very mediocre, although there are many players in the team including Virender Sehwag who have the ability to break any bowling attack
 kings ilevan ipel ke pehle sanskaran ke baad lig charan se aage nikalakar pehali baar final main pahunche hai, jabaki purv champion nite rides kaa yah doosraa final hoga
 Apart from batting, Kings XI has also done well in bowling
 yuva gendbaaj sandip sharma ne apane swing ke boote 11 maichon main 18 wicket chatkaaye hai, to charhare phiraki gendbaaj akshar patel nite rides ke sunil naren ke baad ipel-7 ke duusare sabase kifayati gendbaaj hai
 However, the bowling of Kings XI could not be seen anywhere in front of Suresh Raina's innings in the last match
 jiskaa nite rides ke robin uthppa or yusuf pathan bharpoor laabh uthaanaa chahenge
 While the eyes of Maxwell, Sehwag and David Miller will be on the eyes of the Kings XI, Uthappa, who has been scoring above 40 in 10 consecutive innings and the fastest half-century of the IPL, will be confident of the Knight Riders
 
 donon hi tiimon main chupchaap behtareen pradarshan karne vaale manan vohara or manish pandeya ke yogadan bhi apni tiimon ke liye ahm rahenge
 For the Kings XI, Australian Mitchell Johnson will be on the track to get an early advantage in bowling

 lekin bhartiya speedstar ne kayaason-andaajon ko palatakar rakh diya or apni team ko joardaar jeet dilaai
 After being calm under pressure, Bumrah told what his strategy was before throwing a highly pressurized super over, after drawing a map of the success team
 unhone kaha, team ke saathiyon ne bhi mujhase baat kii
 i told myself that there is no need to take extra pressure
 bas apni kshamtaaon par bharosa rakho, confident raho or shant raho
 After this, implement the plan team has made
 pehle super over kaa anubhav rahaa shandarbumraah ne apane is romaanchak anubhav par bhi baat kii or kaha, ye pehla mauka tha, jab main superover main bowling kar rahaa tha
 The pressure was there, because we had scored only 11 runs
 lekin yahi vakt hota he jab aapako nakaaratmak chizon se dimag hataanaa hota he
 Just look at the positive side and play according to plan
 malinga se bilkul alag tarah yorker gendbaaji kaa karata hum abhyaalantim overon main apni dhardaar gendbaaji par baat karte hue bumraah ne bataaya, lasith malinga wicket ke paas juute rakhkar yorker kaa abhyaas karte hai

 But 72-year-old Anandiben has the full potential to become Modi's suitable successor
 apane puure jivan main unhone hameshaa vibhinn vipareet paristhitiyon kaa saamana kiya or un par jeet hasil kii he
 When she was in the fifth grade, her father Jethabhai Kalidas Patel broke her social taboo and enrolled her in a boys' school
 isse unke samudaay ke logon kii tyoriyaan chadh gayi, lekin anandiben ne apni padhai jari rakhi
 For two years she was the only girl in the entire school
 kuch saal baad jab unki bahan saritaben (ab 95 varsh) ne apni hi jati leuva patel ke apni pasand ke ladke se shaadi kar lee to samudaay ne paanch saal tak unke parivaar kaa hukka-pani band kar diya
 It was a difficult time for the family, but Anandiben stood firm and completed her education
 ek sarkari sahaayta praapt skool main unhen shikshak kii naukari mil gai
 He also completed his msc (gold Medalist) and m
ed
 while teaching in the early 1970s
 varsh 1988 main ahmedabad ke mohiniba girls skool kii principal anandiben ko 'gujarat udhyam evam saahas aword’ se sammanit kiya gaya
 During a picnic, he saved his two girl students from drowning in the river
 1992 main unhen tatkaaleen raashtrapati shankar dayaal sharma se sarvottam shikshak kaa rashtriya sammaan mila
 By that time, Anandiben's stature had also increased in BJP
 party ke yuva rajya sanghathan mantri modi ne unki yogyata ko pahachaanaa or 1988 main unhen party ke saath joda tha
 The BJP was then trying to carve out a niche in Gujarat and was looking for new ambitious faces
 ek skool kii sammanit principal, jo bahaduree kaa aword bhi jeet chuki hon, iske liye upyukt thim
 Anandiben did remarkable work among the drought-affected people of the state in 1988-90, in view of which she was made the president of the bjp's State Women's Front in the year 1990
 iske baad 1991 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan anandiben ne ek kushal vaktaa or sanghathankarta ke rup main apane aap ko sthapit kiya
 In the years that followed, she carved a niche for herself in the Gujarat BJP, but remained loyal to Modi and his trusted Amit Shah
 aise maahaul main bhi jab modi ko shankar singh waghela yaa keshubhai patel se ladaai ladgai pad rahi thi, anandiben ne modi kaa saath diya
 Modi rarely allows other ministers to choose their secretaries
 mukhyamantri ke rup main narendra modi kii behad kathor kaaryastylee ke baavjood anandiben unke saath lagi raheen or dhire-dhire unka bharosa or vishwaas arjeet kiya
 During his long innings in the government, the current Chief Minister Anandiben has gained considerable respect in the bureaucracy due to its ability to take fast decisions, pay attention to specifics and intensive official visits to the state
 1998 main jab ve pehali baar keshubhai patel sarkaar main mantri baniin, uske baad se unhone jitne bhi mantralay sanbhale, un sabakaa kayapalat kar diya
 As Minister of Education between 1998 and 2007, he ended corruption in the appointment and transfer of teachers
 unhone 1,00,000 nae shikshakon kii niyukti kii or rajya kii khastahal praathmik shiksha vyavastha ko durust karne ke liye 80,000 classroom kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 The revenue ministry she was handling since 2007 reduced red tape and started using technology
 jaalsaji rokane or kisaanon kaa malikana haq surakshit rakhane ke liye i-jameen jaise project shuru kiye
 He implemented e-governance at the tehsil level to improve governance at the grassroots level
 modi ne unki tarif karte hue kaha tha, ''rajasav vibhaag main unhone aise badlaav kar apni amit chhap chodi he, jo main lambey samay se chahta tha
 He also made many far-reaching changes in the Urban Development Ministry
 unke 18 maheene ke kaarykaal ke dauraan ek saal main toun planning kii yojanaon ko antim rup dene kii sankhya 30-40 se badhkar 100 tak pahunch gai
 The number of urban development plans finalized also increased from 5-10 to about 20
 aarogy or parivaar kalyaan rajyamantri shankarabhai choudhary ne kaha, ''unhone jo bhi vibhaag sanbhale, apane kushal sanchaalan kii badaulat unamem kuch-na-kuch nayaa jarur kiya
 However, Anandiben also has some limitations
 ve bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich bahut lokapriy nahin hai
 Many people consider him arrogant
 unhone kabhi-kabhi galat logon ko prashray diya he, jisaki vajah se unki sooyeeboojh par sawaal khadey kiye jate rahe hai
 At his behest, Modi gave tickets to two unpopular leaders Kamabhai Rathod and Pragji Patel in the 2012 assembly elections from Sanand and Viramgam seats respectively
 donon haar gaye
 His relationship with RSS is also right
 sangh ke saath unka rishta mukhyat: modi kii vajah se hi he, kyonki ve modi ke kareebi hai
 As a Chief Minister, he will now face a rigorous test as any political uncertainty is feared due to any kind of mistake
 2004 tak modi ko bhi party ke bheetar hi vidhayakon kii ore se anischitata kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 As it was in the state BJP before Modi's arrival
 haalanki anandiben apni safalataa ko lekar aatmavishvaas se bhari hui hai
 He said, "narendrabhai has laid the foundation, i just have to keep pace
 main niti aadhaarit shashan ko banaae rakhuungi
 My aim is to ensure that even the simplest person gets justice
 ”ek rajya ko achche se chalaanaa aasaan kaam nahin he, lekin gujarat kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri ke liye raahat kii baat yah he ki unke purvavarti ne raah dikhaa di he

 Whether it is 'bahubali' or 'bahubali 2', the female character who is being praised in both the films is Ramya Krishnan, an actress playing Rajmata Shivgami
 isse pehle bhi kai hindi filmon main najar aa chuki ramya ke shivgami ke kirdaar ne logon kaa dil jeet liya he, lekin ramya is kirdaar ke liye diarector rajamauli kii pehali pasand nahin thim
 Actually, her first choice for this character was actress Sridevi
 rajamauli ne is kirdaar ke liye jab shridevi ko approach kiya to unhone jo fees maangi vah rajamauli ko kaaphi zyada lagi or rajamauli ne utani fees dene se inkaar kar diya
 Due to this demand, Sridevi continued to be a part of the film, which became the biggest name in the history of Bollywood
 darasal media reports kii maane to rajamauli ne jab shridevi ko is role ke liye approach kiya, to shridevi ne iske liye 6 karod rupee maange the
 Rajamouli was not ready to pay such a huge amount and for this reason the role was given to actress Ramya instead of Sridevi
 is film main ramya ko dhai karod rupee die gaye hai
 Director Ram Gopal Varma has also quipped on Sridevi's lapse and has tweeted on Twitter tagging Sridevi how can Sridevi refuse to be a part of this film

 pune test main bhartiya team kii karaari shikast ke baad pich lagaataar sawaalon ke ghere main he
 On Tuesday, the ICC gave poor ratings to the Pune pitch
 iske baad pich curator dalajit singh ke kariyar par khatra mandaraata dikh rahaa he
 Earlier, Daljit had prepared such a pitch on which the match was over within three days
 dalajit singh bisisiai ke mukhya pich curator hai
 The pitch of the first Test match played between India and Australia was prepared under the guidance of Daljeet
 pich itani kharaab kheli ki test match teen din ke andar hi khatm ho gaya or bharat ko karaari haar mili
 After the test, there was a continuous discussion about the pitch
 mangalvaar ko antarrashtriya cricket sangh ne pune kii pich ko kharaab qaraar diya
 Nagpur was also raised on the pitch
 The third Test match of the series was played in Nagpur between India and South Africa in November 2015
 vah match bhi teen din ke andar ke khatm ho gaya or mejabaan team ne jeet darj kii
 But ICC match referee Jeff Crowe called Nagpur pitch as bad
 dilachasp baat ye he ki nagpur kii ye pich bhi dalajit singh ke maargdarshan main taiyaar kii gai thi
 In danger, Daljit's chair BCCI will now have to send a reply to the ICC in this matter within 14 days
 haalanki ye bataaya ja rahaa he ki team prabandhan or bisisiai kii taraf aisi pich taiyaar karne ke liye dalajit ko koi nirdesh nahin diya gaya tha
 In such a situation, Daljit can be held completely responsible for the poor pitch
 agar aisa hota he to mukhya pich curator ke pad se bhi unhen haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 This is also because it is the icc's second unfavorable rating within 14 months
 samachar agency pitiai ne bisisiai ke sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki team prabandhan ke nirdesh hone ke baavjood bhi dalajit aisi pich taiyaar karne ke liye manaa kar sakate the
 According to the agency, they have every right to prepare the pitch
 jabaki sutron kii maane to isse ulat dalajit team prabandhan kii manmarjee wicket dete rahe hai
 Nominated Chief Justice P
 sadashivam ne kaha he ki ucch adaalaton main nyaayadhishon kii niyukti se sambandhit collegium pranali or samvidhan main mahabhiyog praavdhaanon main badlaav kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 He dismissed the criticism that it was not transparent and the government had no role in it
 sadashivam ne kaha ki haalanki, nyaaypalika niyukti kii vartmaan pranali main sudhaar ke liye koi bhi achche suzav dene yaa kadam uthaane kaa swaagat karti he
 While agreeing that the government is not in a position to 'select' the judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, he said that he felt that the only way to change the system is that the government would Review two important decisions or make constitutional amendments
 nyaayamurti sadashivam ne sweekaar kiya ki sarkaar ke anya angon kii tarah nyapalika main bhi bhrashtachar he, lekin ‘yah na ke baraabar he
 Strongly defending the provisions of impeachment of the constitution, he said that there is a need to provide strong protection to judges of high courts from false complaints and attempts to remove them
 aagaamee 19 july ko pradhan nyaayadhish ke rup main padbhaar grahan karne ja rahe nyaayamurti sadashivam ne haalanki, sweekaar kiya ki bhrasht nyaayadhishon ko hataane main aane vaali samasya se nipatane ke liye andruni tantra main khami he or is pranali main sudhaar ke liye yah dekhnaa jaruri hoga ki vyavastha kii sadan mite
 He said, 'it is not correct to say that there is no transparency (in the appointment of judges) and the government has no role
 ’ vah aisa kanoon laae laane ke liye sarkaar ke kadamon ke bare main puche gaye ek sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the, jisase ucch nyaayalayon or ucchtam nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon ke chayan or niyuktiyon main karypalika kaa dakhal rahegaa
 The Supreme Court in 1993, through an order, put forward the collegium system in appointments, keeping the government separate
 vartmaan vyavastha ke tahat ucch nyaayalayon ke mukhya nyaayadhish do varishthatam nyaayadhishon ke saath salaah mashvira kar pratyaashit nyaayadhishon ke naamon kii sifarish karte hai
 Sadashivam said that the proposal goes through various channels such as the Center, Chief Ministers, Governors and intelligence agencies for certification, investigation and comments
 unhone kaha, ‘mukhyamantri ko tippanee deni hoti he, rajyapal ko apana mat prakat karnaa hota he, centre apni tippaniyan detaa he or khufia beuro ummidavaaron kii pramanikta, unke raajnneetik judaav, yadi koi ho, unke charitra ko pramanit karne kaa kaary karata he
 'opinions are also sought from independent people including judges outside the collegium, eminent personalities
 nyaayamurti ne kaha, ‘ekmaatr shikaayat yah he ki ve (sarkaar) ummidavaaron kaa chayan nahin kar sakate
 'justifying the present system, the nominated Chief Justice said that the members of the collegium (selection board) arrive at the post after much experience
 ve padonnati ke maamle main pratyaashit nyaayadhishon ke faislon ko padhate hai tathaa sthiti kii vyaktigat jaankaree hasil karne ke liye rajyon ke nyaayik abhikaran or baar se baat karte hai
 He said, 'I am not underestimating his (government's) ability, but (in the appointment of judges) we are in a better position
 ’ peethon (jinamein 1993 main divangat nyaayamurti jees verma shaamil the or ek baad main 1998 kii) dwaara die gaye faislon kaa ullekh karte hue nyaayamurti sadashivam ne kaha ki ye vishay par moolyawaan dastavej hai or unhen nazarandaaj karnaa kathin he
 He said, 'only God or a big bench can change these decisions
 sarkaar ko faislon kii samiksha kerani hogi yaa samvidhan sanshodhan laana hoga
 'justice said, however,' We are not opposing it (the government)
 yadi sarkaar kuch achche kadam sujhaati he, ham ise sweekaar karne ko taiyaar hai
 They have to do it according to the need of law
 ham achche sujhaavon ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 On the issue of corruption in the judiciary, he said, "if we compare the judiciary with other organs like the state executive and the legislature, then it is negligible
 nyaayadhishon ke khilaaf shikayaton se nipatane ke liye ek tantra he
 Justice Sadasivam said that he does not agree with the opinion that the current impeachment provisions are mostly in favor of the judiciary
 unhone kaha, ‘nyaayadhishon ke jimme kathin kaary hota he
 They cannot be removed like ordinary people
 unhen tuchh shikayaton or kadamon se sanvaidhanik suraksha kii aavashyaktaa he
 However, he gave an advisory to the members of the Nyapalika
 unhone kaha, ‘nyaayadhishon ko apane sanvaidhanik dayitvon or nagarikon ke prati apni jimmedaariyon ko lekar sajag hona chahie
 If anyone violates the code of conduct, the High Court and the Supreme Court can take action

 Chidambaram was addressing the conference of Home Ministers and Social Justice Ministers of all states
 unhone kaha ki desh kii 25 fisadi aabaadi ko abhi tak ham tamaam suvidhaayen muhaiyaa nahin kara paaen hai
 Chidambaram said that after the Chief Ministers' meeting, it was decided to organize this meeting with the hope that some Chief Ministers would attend this meeting
 chidambaram ne khushi vyakt karte hue kaha ki unhen khushi he ki rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot yahaan maujuud hai
 Chidambaram said, this meeting is very important for social justice and other issues as s and ST are still facing many difficulties
 unhone aage kaha, 'upree taur par chuaachhut kii samasya to khatm ho gai magar samay ke saath isaki paribhaasha bhi badal rahi he
 Those who are 'harijans' are denied entry into temples and still do not reach the police to protect their rights

 We have issued many guidelines but so far we have not been able to do anything for their socio-economic upliftment
 is chuaachhut se nipatane ke liye sirf kanoon or disha-nirdesh hi kaaphi nahin hai
 Referring to the Jessica Lal assassination, Chidambaram said, "when Jessica Lal died, people took out a candle march, a film was made on it, but why was there no Andolan in Bihar killing 21 Dalits?" Governments are everywhere and they can do a lot if they want

 com / spw8onnram— BCCI (@BCCI) June 8, 2019 In the ICC World-2019 match played against South Africa of India, the army's mark was made on Dhoni's gloves, which the ICC had objected to and told the BCCI He should ask Dhoni to remove this sign from his gloves
 bisisiai ne isisi se dhoni ko yah chinh banaae rakhane kii manjuuri maangi thi, jise isisi ne nakaar diya tha
 BCCI CEO Rahul Johri is leaving for London to talk to the ICC on this issue

 Vinod Rai has said in this case that if the Army's mark is in violation of ICC rules, then BCCI will not violate it
 isi tarah kii baat johri ne bhi kahi, lekin khilaadiyon ne kaha ki ve apane purv captain ke saath hai
 Captain Virat Kohli also said that Dhoni has put this mark in honor of the army and there is no harm in it
 landan main bhartiya camp kii andar kii baton kii jaankaree rakhane vaale sutron ne ieenes se baat karte hue kaha ki khilaadiyon ne saaf kar diya he ki ve dhoni ke saath hai or is maamle ko bina matlab kaa tool diya ja rahaa he

 This is a golden opportunity that we are sitting for a very serious discussion to strengthen the foundation of this democracy
 sar, 1952 se hi bharat main ye sawaal uthta tha ki itane bade desh main, itane bade bhugolic vistaar vaale desh main, itane bade-bade topography vaale desh main chunaav prakriya inmpliment karana kaise sambhav he
 But i can say very clearly that every election since 1952 has not only been made possible by the Election Commission, but has successfully shown it
 duniya main kai demokrasi isliye barabaad hoti chali gayi kyonki vahaan kii chunaav prakriya main khamiyaan thim
 So, what i am going to talk about here or we all have kept our point, it does not mean lack of faith
 jaisaa ki aapane apni baat main kaha ki hamen evolve hona he
 Evolution is a process
 isliye yahaan kahi hui baton ko pheth main kami yaa tikaa-tippanee naa mana jaae balki evolution ke process main diya gaya contribution mana jaae
 This is important because many questions are arising right now
 koi candidet kah rahaa he ki uske parivaar main 19 vot hai or mujhe apane booth par keval 2 vot mili hai
 Questions are also arising that where a candidate raised these questions or talked about recounting, it was refused
 bahut sari chizon ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai
 These questions are not about any particular person
 kisi aapke ayog par yaa hamaare ayog par nahin he
 The question is on the process
 us process main istemaal hone vaali mashin par he
 i put two-three things in front of you
 aapane kaha, "looking forward to evolve sar, you are looking for further improvement sar, further improvement is only possible when we in principle accept that yes there are certain problems within our systems
 If we keep repeating again and again it's not possible
 
 
 
 This is impossible
 
 This cannot be done
 
 
 "to phir iske baad koi impruvement ho hi nahin saktaa
 Possibilities of further improvement are no more
 isliye meraa hambal sabamishan he ki ab tak pregentation main jo dikhaa he
 It seems to us that as long as you keep saying Impossible, you will keep saying in front of us every time
 hamaari baatcheet ke scope kam hote jaaenge
 Scope of raising our questions will decrease
 or fardar impruvement ke scope to ekadam jiro hote chale jate hai
 The presentation was like a directive principals
 vish list kii tarah thi
 It was about what an ideal election system could be
 bahut acchhee baat he
 But if i look at your entire presentation, it is based on two pillars
 pehla ye ki hamaari iviem non tempring he
 Secondly our administrative safeguard is very safe
 bahut badhiya he
 By relying on both, you are saying that EVM cannot be tempered
 kai baar di ja chuki he wo ki chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa
 If no one can read the chip after programming the chip, it means that we are just saying on the trust of the company that loaded the software that that company - we told him the proto type of software, he made that software Is loaded into the chip
 hamamen se kisi ko nahin pataa usamen kya software he, we don't know usamen kya software he
 Because its software cannot be read, we are admitting
 iskaa matlab chunaav ayog ke paas main bharose kii jaankaree he, ham guarantee nahin le sakate ki usne jo software daalaa he, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 ki usne jo software aplod kiya
 Second, you said motherboard, in that you said that first level checkup happens, and during first level checkup we see
 aapane ek turm yuz kiya ki agar madraboard change kiya gaya hoga to, wo to first level chekup ke dauraan pataa chal jaayegaa
 Sir, i want to ask, during the first level checkup, for the information of your company's engineers open the machine and check the motherboard
 kyunki jab aapkaa demonstration yahaan ho rahaa tha
 So i used to ask them categorical that when you go to the engineer to do first love check, do you open the machine from inside and go to motherboard checking or not? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 If we do not open the machine up to that level at the first level checkup, how can we say if the motherboard has changed then we will know that the motherboard has changed
 ye isliye jaruri he sar, kyonki madraboard change karne kii posibility main jab aapaki second prere par aauungaa to baat karuunga aapse
 In this, some colleagues had raised the question, i am going to go ahead by just underlining those questions for the interest of time
 What technology are you using? All this technology
 
 
 kyonki aapaki technology main safegaurd the, hamane mashiinon main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai, hamane adminstrations main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai
 
 
 
 this presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 i think in technology, you should do a separate session together with the technical expert
 it should be an open discussion
 Where there are good technocrats from IIT to IIID in our country
 unsab ke saath main baith kar ek open discshan ho
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 wo kya technology he? aapaki mashin sarkaar kii do companiyaan banati hai
 Stay in that too
 aapane bhind ke bare main example, kuch answer die
 i can't seem to find anything convecting into it right now
 usamen kuch lupahole hai
 i would like to discuss that too
 aapane discuss kiya ki germany ke court ne ye kaha tha, germany ke court kaa aapane zikr kiya, sar, germany ke court kaa jo reference he usame wo emportent hai
 Its principal is IMPORTANT
 usne kaha 'voter or rigelt ke bich technology par nirbhar karnaa uncostitutional he' that is the statement
 It is uncostitutional to rely on technology between voter and result confidence, Sir, these were some observations about the machine
 main administrative safeguard ke bare main with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 Because they are also among us
 ham sab logon ke bich main se hi nikal kar aane vaale ladke-ladkiyaan hai
 We know what government machinery is? The safeguard that you have, if i say it in the native language, then they are the safeguard of the government officer and government machinery
 or wo sarkari mashinari kab, kitni politicali influence hoti he or kab kitni financiel influence ho jaati he, iske lakhon evidence ham logon ne dekhen hai
 In not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life, we see how influential our political machinery is
 sar, yahi administration to EVM se pehle tha, jis vakt hamane ek desh ke naate, samaaj ke naate, administration ke naate hamane tay kiya tha ki ab manual voting se EVM kii voting par jaayenge
 At that time, we used to see defects in this machinery
 riging ho jaati he, afasar influence main aa jate hai, afasaron ko daraa diya jaataa he, unako blackmel kar liya jaataa he
 They get into rigging by influencing them, and even rob the booth
 main patrkaar tha sar, aath das saal patrakarita kii he maine
 i have also reported how the booth was robbed
 maine bahut remote aria par bhi ja kar cover kiya he to wo mashinari booth lut main shaamil ho jaati thi
 Many times this is why we came to technology like evm to be safe
 usee afasar ke bharose ham sirf ye kahkar ki vahaan bahut acha, kisi jagah bahut acha afasar baitha hoga, kisi jagah influence afasar bhi baitha hoga to ye garenti nahin ho sakati
 Sir, as much as we can talk about safe guard here, let me tell you sir
 abhi dilli main chunaav hue, aap kah sakate hai ki wo aapke domen main nahin the lekin kuch realitys hai jo har jagah match karengi
 Despite all the orders of the Sir Election Commission, an inspector goes to an SHO and tells the candidate, "brother, if you want to campaign, give me an AC, otherwise your boys will not be allowed to stand there who were distributing leaflets, Sir
" You will complain but you will not have any proof but there are many of us who know, most of us know that if there are two boys standing on the street for honest campaigning Field visit and give them off station can be up to four hours of police in jeeps, we choose Prcr is then destroyed
 or uski theg detaa he inspector ek lagava do nahin to dekhtaa hum kaise campan karte ho, dekhtaa hum doosraa sipaahi aa kar kahata he vardi ke paise de do, do acchhee vardi ke paise de do, kanat place se lani he
 These are quotes, such quotes can be given by every one of us in every ward
 aapako bahut saare udhaaharan de saktaa he
 Sir, you said that flc's invitation goes to all the parties to participate in it, so i gave it the word Sir, we have spoken like directive principals
 efffactiveli jab ham ground par ja kar dekhte he to How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 How many sdms, how many tehsildars are welcoming candidates there or political party representatives
 kitne discoureging hote hai, ye baat ham sab log jaanate he, yahaan baithe hue har party ke log jaanate hai
 Sir, i want to keep three things here as a proposal
 ham log lagaataar sun rahe the ki haikethon hoga or mujhe lagata he ki ye acchhee chiz he
 Hackathon, to date, word has arrived, hackathon is not a crime
 athical haikethon ek shabd aa gaya he
 So let us conduct an ethical hackathon, we should not avoid it
 aapane apane sambodhan main kaha ki ham haikethon nahin karaayenge, ham chalange denge
 Sir, the scope of your challenge is the first thing that is not a hackathon because either you give us the last five elections we are talking about, (a) you give us the machines openly, we will hack it and show it to you
 (b) agar aap kyonki dekhiye aap kahenge abhi is mashiinon ko hack nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki hekking kii ek paribhaasha he
 Our friends are sitting, my partner Sourav Bhardwaj
 ye ambeded technology main 9 saal kaa tajurba rakhte hai
 After engineering, he hacked a prototype of a machine and showed it two days ago in Delhi assembly
 sar us mashin ke bare main, main bhi guarantee le saktaa hum ki usko bhi koi hack karke nahin dikhaa saktaa kyonki ham uskaa code jaanate hai, ham usko hack kar sakate hai, ham temprd kar sakate hai to kitni tempring he usamen kyonki aapane jo shabd istemaal kiya usko istemaal kar rahaa hum
 You said, proof that there was tempering in the last elections
 sar, main aapke saamne apni mashin rakh rahaa hum
 Nobody can give proof of that
 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the
 There are many areas where a lot of people have filed affidavits that i had voted, my party to whom i voted has got 10 votes
 or 20 log affidavit file karke ye kah rahe hai ki hamane to isi party ko vot diya tha sahab, kahaan gaya hamaara vot, sirf 10 kaise aae
 So wherever such revolutionary issues have come, my submission will be that you take the machines of such booths in your position, make them a multi-party team here, sit a magistrate and call those people who have given affidavits in front of them
 Was
 meraa pehla suzav to ye he ki jin jagahon par pratyaashiyon ko parinaamon main gadabadi kii sabase zyada shankaa he, vahaan kii EVM chunaav ayukta apane kabje main len or aise jo pratyaashee jo affidavit dekar kah rahe hai ki hamaare vot nateezon ke vot se zyada hai, unhen sabhi bhaag lene vaale dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke saamne apane voters ko laane ko kahen, shapath patr ke hisaab se samay kaa milan karke un voters ke vot kii jaanch magistrate kii upasthiti main kara len
 If they are right, then it is a matter of investigation, and if they are wrong, then no matter what, i pray to God that their claims are wrong because only then our democracy is safe! Only then will we be able to run according to the democratic system! main chunaav ayog ke is aadesh kii saraahna karata hoon ki aapane aage ke sabhi chunaav VVPAT ke saath karaane kaa nirnay liya he, jo ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saraahneey kadam he
 But there is a special point in this that i am keeping as a suggestion
 mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne jab kaha ki chunaavon main VVPAT kaa istemaal ho to unhone sirf VVPAT mashin lagane ko nahin kaha, VVPAT hamen avasar detaa he ki agar voting se matganana ke bich main koi gadabad ho to, uskaa milan VVPAT ke print se milan ho sake lekin us print raseed kii ginati kii vyavastha nahin he, us printig kii ginati sirf ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad ho sakati he
 The Election Commission should arrange such that the EVM count of at least 25 per cent of the booth vote in every assembly or Lok Sabha or election should be matched with the VVPAT slip
 wo 25 fisadi booth kaa chayan random tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he, yaa pratyaashiyon kii icchaanusaar ho saktaa he
 At 25 per cent booth, you make slip count mandatory, only then VVPAT will be used effectively
 nahin to koun kab aapatti daayar karata he, phir court jaataa he, phir faisla aata he, ayukta mahoday ye bahut lambii prakriya he ise hamen saral bananaa hi hoga
 My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it
 main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! Many democracies in the world have been ruined because there were flaws in the election process
 isliye main jo yahaan baat rakhane ja rahaa hum yaa ham sab logon ne apni apni baat rakhi he, uskaa matlab pheth main kami nahin he
 As you said in your talk we have to evolve
 evolution kaa process he
 Therefore, what is said here should not be considered to be a reduction in faith or commentary, but rather a contribution given in the process of evolution
 ye isliye jaruri he kyonki abhi kai sawaal uth rahe hai
 Some candidate is saying that there are 19 votes in his family and i got only 2 votes at my booth
 sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki jahaan kisi candidet ne ye sawaal uthaae yaa ricounting kii baat kii to manaa kar diya gaya
 Questions are being raised about many things
 ye sawaal kisi vyakti vishesh ko lekar nahin hai
 No one is on your commission or on our commission
 sawaal processes par he
 Is on the machine used in that process
 main do-teen chijen aapke saamne rakhata hum
 You said, "looking forward to evolve sir, you are looking for further improvement sir, further improvement is only possible when we accept the principle that yes there are certain problems within our systems
 If we keep repeating again and again it's not possible
 
 
 
 ye to asambhav he
 
 ye to ho hi nahin saktaa
 
 
 "then no improvement can happen after this
 further improvement kii sambhavanaayen rah nahin jaatin
 So my Humble submission is what has been shown so far in the presentation
 hamen aisa lagata he ki jab tak aap imposible kehete rahenge, hamaare saamne har baar kehete rahenge
 The scope of our conversation will decrease
 hamaare prashn uthaane ke scope kam hote jaaenge
 And the scopes of farther improvement go absolutely zero
 pregentation main diarective principles kii tarah thi
 Wish was like a list
 ek adarsh chunaav vyavastha kya ho sakati he, uske bare main thi
 Very good
 lekin aapke puure prajentation ko main dekhuun to do pillar par aadhaarit he
 The first is that our EVM is non-tempering
 doosraa hamaara administrative sefguard bahut surakshit he
 It is very good
 donon par bharosa karke aap kah rahe hai ki iviem kii tempring nahin ho sakati
 It has been given many times that no one can read the chip
 agar chip ko programing karne ke baad chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa to iskaa matlab ham sirf software ko lod karne vaali company ke bharose par ye kah rahe hai ki us company ne- hamane usko software kaa proto tip bataaya, usne wo software banaakar us chip main lod kar diya he
 None of us know what software is in it, we don't know what software is in it
 kyonki uske software ko read nahin kiya ja saktaa, ham admit kar rahe hai
 This means that the Election Commission has trust information, we cannot guarantee that the software it has inserted, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 That the software he uploaded
 doosraa, aapane kaha madraboard, usamen aapane kaha ki first level chekup hota he, or first level chekup ke dauraan ham dekhte hai
 You used a term that if the motherboard was changed, then it would be known during the first level checkup
 sar, main poochna chahta hum, jaankaree ke liye kya first level chekup ke dauraan aapaki company ke engeenior mashin ko khol kar madraboard check karte hai
 Because when your demonstration was happening here
 to unase main categorical ye baat poochi thi ki aap engeenior jab jate hai first lavale chekup karne to kya aap mashin ko andar se khol kar madraboard kii checking tak jate hai yaa nahin? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 agar ham first level chekup par mashin ko us level tak hi nahin kholte hai to, how can we say agar madraboard change hua hoga to hamako pataa chal jaayegaa ki madraboard change kar diya he kisi ne
 This is important, sir, because the possibility of changing the motherboard, i will talk to you when i come on your second prayer
 isamen kuch saathiyon ne sawaal uthaaya tha, main bas un sawaalon ko thodaa sa anderline karke aage ja rahaa hum for the interest of time ki micro controlar koun banaata he? aap technology koun si yuz kar rahe hai? ye sari technology
 
 
 Because there were safegaurd in your technology, we have installed these safegaurd in machines, we have installed these safegaurd in adminstrations
 
 
 
 This presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 aapako technology main mujhe lagata he technical export ke saath main milakar ek alag se seshan karne chahie
 it should be an open discussion
 jahaan IIT se lekar IIID se lekar achche achche technocrate hamaare desh main hai
 There should be an open discussion sitting with them all
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 What is that technology? Your machine becomes two government companies
 ye bhi usamen rahen
 You gave example, some answers about Bhind
 main frankli abhi usamen kuch konvening nahin lag rahaa he
 It has a few loopholes
 main usko bhi discuss karnaa chaahunga
 You discussed that the German court had said this, you referred to the German court, Sir, the reference to the German court is important
 uskaa principal emportent he
 He said 'it is uncostitutional to rely on technology between voters and results'
 voter or rigelt ke bharose ke bich technology par nirbhar karnaa uncostitutional he, sar, ye mashin ko lekar mere kuch objaraveshan the
 i regarding administrative safeguard with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 kyunki wo bhi hamaare bich main se hi hai
 There are boys and girls who come out from among us all
 ham jaanate hai ki sarkari mashinari kya hoti he? aapke paas jo safeguard hai, agar main usko desi bhashaa main kahuun to wo sarkari afasar or sarkari mashinari ke safeguard hai
 And when we have seen the government machinery, how much politically influent and how many financial influencers have happened, we have seen millions of evidences
 not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life main ham dekhte hai ki hamaare polytical mashinari kitni influence rahati he
 Sir, this administration was before EVM, when we, as a country, as a society, as an administration, we had decided that now we will go to EVM voting through manual voting
 tab hamen isi mashinari main khamiyaan dikhti thim
 Rigging takes place, officers come under influence, officers are intimidated, they are blackmailed
 wo influence hokar riging kara dete hai, booth lut tak kara dete hai
 i was a journalist Sir, i have done journalism for eight to ten years
 maine reporting bhi kii he ki kaise booth lut hoti thi
 i have covered a very remote area and used to get involved in looting machinery booths
 kai baar isiilie to ham evm jaisi technology kii taraf aae ki sef rahen
 Depending on the same officer, we can not be guaranteed just by saying that there will be a very good, very good officer sitting somewhere, and if there is an influential officer sitting somewhere
 sar ham jitani baat kar len yahaan par sef gord kii, main aapako bataata hum sar
 Now elections were held in Delhi, you can say that they were not in your domain but there are some realities that will match everywhere
 sar ellection kamishan ke tamaam adeshon ke baavjood ek inspector jaakar, ek esechao ja kar candidet ko kahata he, bhai prachaar karnaa he to zaraa ek AC lagava do, varanaa tumhaare ladakon ko vahaan khadaa nahin hone duungaa jo parche baant rahe the, sar aapke paas shikaayat karenge aapke paas koi saboot bhi nahin aa paayegaa lakin vahaan ham saare log jaanate hai, hamame se adhiktar log jaanate hai ki agar eemaandaaree se chunaav prachaar ke liye do ladke sadak par khadey kiye jaaen or unako chaar ghante ke liye police apni jeep main le ja kar thane main band kar de, to hamaara chunaav prachar to chaupat ho jaataa he
 And the inspector gives him the contract, if not get one attached, then i see how you do the campaign, i see the other soldier come and say, give uniform money, give two good uniform money, have to bring from Connaught Place
 yah uddhran hai, aise uddhran har ward main hamamen se har koi de saktaa he
 Can give you lots of examples
 sar aapane kaha FLC kaa nimantran jaataa he har partiyon ko usamen bhagidaari karen, isliye maine sar isko shabd diya diarective principles kii tarah se hamane bolaa he
 How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 kitne SDM, kitne tehseeldaar vahaan candidats ko leki yaa polytical party ripregentative ko leki welcomming hote hai
 We all know how much discreasing happens, people of every party sitting here know
 sar main teen chizein rakhana chahta hum yahaan par prapojal ke rup main
 We were constantly hearing that there would be hackathons and i think that is a good thing
 haikethon, aaj kii taarikh main shabd aa gaya he, haikethon koi aparaadh nahin he
 Ethical Hackathon is a term arrived
 to ham athical haikethon karaaen, ham bachein na usase
 You said in your address that we will not conduct hackathons, we will challenge
 sar aapkaa jo chalange kaa scope he pehali baat wo haikethon nahin he kyonki yaa to aap hamen jin pichley paanch chunaavon kii baat ham kar rahe hai, (a) aap hamen mashine openali de dijiye, ham usko hack kar ke dikhaa denge aapako
 (b) If you look because you will say this machines cannot be hacked right now because there is a definition of hacking
 hamaare mitra baithe hai, mere saathi saurav bharadwaj
 They hold 9 years of experience in embedded technology
 ejineering ke baad inhone aaj do din pehle dilli vidhansabha main bhi ek mashin kaa prototip hack kar ke dikhaaya
 Sir, about that machine, i can also guarantee that no one can hack it and show it because we know its code, we can hack it, we can temper it so how much tempering is there because the word you Used, i am using it
 aapane kaha pichley chunaavo main tempring hui thi iskaa pruf do
 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa
 Someone should liberate him a little, put a Liberal approach in it and go with this positive approach because Mishra Saheb also mentioned, we were saying in Punjab too
 bahut saare aise aria hai jahaan bahut saare logon ne affidavit file kiye hai ki maine vot diya tha, meri party jisko maine vot diya tha usko 10 vot aae hai
 And 20 people have filed affidavits saying that we had voted for this party, sir, where did our vote go, how did only 10 come
 to jahaan jahaan aise controvarsial ishyus aae hai, meraa sabamishan sar ye rahegaa ki is tarah ke booth kii mashiinon ko aap apane pojeshan main len, unako yahaan multi party team banaaen, ek magistrate ko baithaaen or unke saamne un logon bulaaen jin logon ne affidavit diya tha
 My first suggestion is that the EVM Election Commissioners should take possession of the places where the candidates are most suspicious of the results and the candidates who are giving affidavits saying that our votes are more than the results of the votes
 Ask them to bring their voters in front of the candidates of all the participating parties, checking the votes of those voters by matching the time according to the affidavit
 Get it done in the presence of CRET
 agar ve sahi kah rahe hai to jaanch kaa vishay he, or yadi ve galat hai to koi baat nahin, main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki unke daawey galat hon kyonki sirf tabhi hamaara loktantr surakshit he! tabhi ham loktantric vyavastha ke anusaar chal paaenge! i appreciate this order of the Election Commission that you have decided to hold all further elections with VVPAT, which is a commendable step for the development of the country
 lekin isamen ek vishesh baat he jo main suzav ke rup main rakh rahaa hum
 When the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that VVPAT should be used in elections, they did not just ask for the installation of VVPAT machine, VVPAT gives us the opportunity to match the print of the VVPAT if there is a problem in the middle of counting of votes
 But there is no arrangement for counting of print receipts, that printing can be counted only after the order of High Court
 chunaav ayog aisi vyavastha kare ki har vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa yaa chunaav main kam se kam 25 fisadi booth ke vot kii EVM kii ginati kaa milan, VVPAT kii parchi ke saath ho
 That 25 percent of the booths can be selected randomly, or as per the wishes of the candidates
 25 fisadi booth par aap parchi kii ginati ko anivaary kar den, tabhi VVPAT kaa prabhavi prayog ho paayegaa
 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin
 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke
 Thanks a lot! duniya main kai demokrasi isliye barabaad hoti chali gayi kyonki vahaan kii chunaav prakriya main khamiyaan thim
 So, what i am going to talk about here or we all have kept our point, it does not mean lack of faith
 jaisaa ki aapane apni baat main kaha ki hamen evolve hona he
 Evolution is a process
 isliye yahaan kahi hui baton ko pheth main kami yaa tikaa-tippanee naa mana jaae balki evolution ke process main diya gaya contribution mana jaae
 This is important because many questions are arising right now
 koi candidet kah rahaa he ki uske parivaar main 19 vot hai or mujhe apane booth par keval 2 vot mili hai
 Questions are also arising that where a candidate raised these questions or talked about recounting, it was refused
 bahut sari chizon ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai
 These questions are not about any particular person
 kisi aapke ayog par yaa hamaare ayog par nahin he
 The question is on the process
 us process main istemaal hone vaali mashin par he
 i put two-three things in front of you
 aapane kaha, "looking forward to evolve sar, you are looking for further improvement sar, further improvement is only possible when we in principle accept that yes there are certain problems within our systems
 If we keep repeating again and again it's not possible
 
 
 
 This is impossible
 
 This cannot be done
 
 
 "to phir iske baad koi impruvement ho hi nahin saktaa
 Possibilities of further improvement are no more
 isliye meraa hambal sabamishan he ki ab tak pregentation main jo dikhaa he
 It seems to us that as long as you keep saying Impossible, you will keep saying in front of us every time
 hamaari baatcheet ke scope kam hote jaaenge
 Scope of raising our questions will decrease
 or fardar impruvement ke scope to ekadam jiro hote chale jate hai
 The presentation was like a directive principals
 vish list kii tarah thi
 It was about what an ideal election system could be
 bahut acchhee baat he
 But if i look at your entire presentation, it is based on two pillars
 pehla ye ki hamaari iviem non tempring he
 Secondly our administrative safeguard is very safe
 bahut badhiya he
 By relying on both, you are saying that EVM cannot be tempered
 kai baar di ja chuki he wo ki chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa
 If no one can read the chip after programming the chip, it means that we are just saying on the trust of the company that loaded the software that that company - we told him the proto type of software, he made that software Is loaded into the chip
 hamamen se kisi ko nahin pataa usamen kya software he, we don't know usamen kya software he
 Because its software cannot be read, we are admitting
 iskaa matlab chunaav ayog ke paas main bharose kii jaankaree he, ham guarantee nahin le sakate ki usne jo software daalaa he, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 ki usne jo software aplod kiya
 Second, you said motherboard, in that you said that first level checkup happens, and during first level checkup we see
 aapane ek turm yuz kiya ki agar madraboard change kiya gaya hoga to, wo to first level chekup ke dauraan pataa chal jaayegaa
 Sir, i want to ask, during the first level checkup, for the information of your company's engineers open the machine and check the motherboard
 kyunki jab aapkaa demonstration yahaan ho rahaa tha
 So i used to ask them categorical that when you go to the engineer to do first love check, do you open the machine from inside and go to motherboard checking or not? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 If we do not open the machine up to that level at the first level checkup, how can we say if the motherboard has changed then we will know that the motherboard has changed
 ye isliye jaruri he sar, kyonki madraboard change karne kii posibility main jab aapaki second prere par aauungaa to baat karuunga aapse
 In this, some colleagues had raised the question, i am going to go ahead by just underlining those questions for the interest of time
 What technology are you using? All this technology
 
 
 kyonki aapaki technology main safegaurd the, hamane mashiinon main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai, hamane adminstrations main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai
 
 
 
 this presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 i think in technology, you should do a separate session together with the technical expert
 it should be an open discussion
 Where there are good technocrats from IIT to IIID in our country
 unsab ke saath main baith kar ek open discshan ho
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 wo kya technology he? aapaki mashin sarkaar kii do companiyaan banati hai
 Stay in that too
 aapane bhind ke bare main example, kuch answer die
 i can't seem to find anything convecting into it right now
 usamen kuch lupahole hai
 i would like to discuss that too
 aapane discuss kiya ki germany ke court ne ye kaha tha, germany ke court kaa aapane zikr kiya, sar, germany ke court kaa jo reference he usame wo emportent hai
 Its principal is IMPORTANT
 usne kaha 'voter or rigelt ke bich technology par nirbhar karnaa uncostitutional he' that is the statement
 It is uncostitutional to rely on technology between voter and result confidence, Sir, these were some observations about the machine
 main administrative safeguard ke bare main with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 Because they are also among us
 ham sab logon ke bich main se hi nikal kar aane vaale ladke-ladkiyaan hai
 We know what government machinery is? The safeguard that you have, if i say it in the native language, then they are the safeguard of the government officer and government machinery
 or wo sarkari mashinari kab, kitni politicali influence hoti he or kab kitni financiel influence ho jaati he, iske lakhon evidence ham logon ne dekhen hai
 In not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life, we see how influential our political machinery is
 sar, yahi administration to EVM se pehle tha, jis vakt hamane ek desh ke naate, samaaj ke naate, administration ke naate hamane tay kiya tha ki ab manual voting se EVM kii voting par jaayenge
 At that time, we used to see defects in this machinery
 riging ho jaati he, afasar influence main aa jate hai, afasaron ko daraa diya jaataa he, unako blackmel kar liya jaataa he
 They get into rigging by influencing them, and even rob the booth
 main patrkaar tha sar, aath das saal patrakarita kii he maine
 i have also reported how the booth was robbed
 maine bahut remote aria par bhi ja kar cover kiya he to wo mashinari booth lut main shaamil ho jaati thi
 Many times this is why we came to technology like evm to be safe
 usee afasar ke bharose ham sirf ye kahkar ki vahaan bahut acha, kisi jagah bahut acha afasar baitha hoga, kisi jagah influence afasar bhi baitha hoga to ye garenti nahin ho sakati
 Sir, as much as we can talk about safe guard here, let me tell you sir
 abhi dilli main chunaav hue, aap kah sakate hai ki wo aapke domen main nahin the lekin kuch realitys hai jo har jagah match karengi
 Despite all the orders of the Sir Election Commission, an inspector goes to an SHO and tells the candidate, "brother, if you want to campaign, give me an AC, otherwise your boys will not be allowed to stand there who were distributing leaflets, Sir
" You will complain but you will not have any proof but there are many of us who know, most of us know that if there are two boys standing on the street for honest campaigning Field visit and give them off station can be up to four hours of police in jeeps, we choose Prcr is then destroyed
 or uski theg detaa he inspector ek lagava do nahin to dekhtaa hum kaise campan karte ho, dekhtaa hum doosraa sipaahi aa kar kahata he vardi ke paise de do, do acchhee vardi ke paise de do, kanat place se lani he
 These are quotes, such quotes can be given by every one of us in every ward
 aapako bahut saare udhaaharan de saktaa he
 Sir, you said that flc's invitation goes to all the parties to participate in it, so i gave it the word Sir, we have spoken like directive principals
 efffactiveli jab ham ground par ja kar dekhte he to How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 How many sdms, how many tehsildars are welcoming candidates there or political party representatives
 kitne discoureging hote hai, ye baat ham sab log jaanate he, yahaan baithe hue har party ke log jaanate hai
 Sir, i want to keep three things here as a proposal
 ham log lagaataar sun rahe the ki haikethon hoga or mujhe lagata he ki ye acchhee chiz he
 Hackathon, to date, word has arrived, hackathon is not a crime
 athical haikethon ek shabd aa gaya he
 So let us conduct an ethical hackathon, we should not avoid it
 aapane apane sambodhan main kaha ki ham haikethon nahin karaayenge, ham chalange denge
 Sir, the scope of your challenge is the first thing that is not a hackathon because either you give us the last five elections we are talking about, (a) you give us the machines openly, we will hack it and show it to you
 (b) agar aap kyonki dekhiye aap kahenge abhi is mashiinon ko hack nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki hekking kii ek paribhaasha he
 Our friends are sitting, my partner Sourav Bhardwaj
 ye ambeded technology main 9 saal kaa tajurba rakhte hai
 After engineering, he hacked a prototype of a machine and showed it two days ago in Delhi assembly
 sar us mashin ke bare main, main bhi guarantee le saktaa hum ki usko bhi koi hack karke nahin dikhaa saktaa kyonki ham uskaa code jaanate hai, ham usko hack kar sakate hai, ham temprd kar sakate hai to kitni tempring he usamen kyonki aapane jo shabd istemaal kiya usko istemaal kar rahaa hum
 You said, proof that there was tempering in the last elections
 sar, main aapke saamne apni mashin rakh rahaa hum
 Nobody can give proof of that
 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the
 There are many areas where a lot of people have filed affidavits that i had voted, my party to whom i voted has got 10 votes
 or 20 log affidavit file karke ye kah rahe hai ki hamane to isi party ko vot diya tha sahab, kahaan gaya hamaara vot, sirf 10 kaise aae
 So wherever such revolutionary issues have come, my submission will be that you take the machines of such booths in your position, make them a multi-party team here, sit a magistrate and call those people who have given affidavits in front of them
 Was
 meraa pehla suzav to ye he ki jin jagahon par pratyaashiyon ko parinaamon main gadabadi kii sabase zyada shankaa he, vahaan kii EVM chunaav ayukta apane kabje main len or aise jo pratyaashee jo affidavit dekar kah rahe hai ki hamaare vot nateezon ke vot se zyada hai, unhen sabhi bhaag lene vaale dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke saamne apane voters ko laane ko kahen, shapath patr ke hisaab se samay kaa milan karke un voters ke vot kii jaanch magistrate kii upasthiti main kara len
 If they are right, then it is a matter of investigation, and if they are wrong, then no matter what, i pray to God that their claims are wrong because only then our democracy is safe! Only then will we be able to run according to the democratic system! main chunaav ayog ke is aadesh kii saraahna karata hoon ki aapane aage ke sabhi chunaav VVPAT ke saath karaane kaa nirnay liya he, jo ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saraahneey kadam he
 But there is a special point in this that i am keeping as a suggestion
 mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne jab kaha ki chunaavon main VVPAT kaa istemaal ho to unhone sirf VVPAT mashin lagane ko nahin kaha, VVPAT hamen avasar detaa he ki agar voting se matganana ke bich main koi gadabad ho to, uskaa milan VVPAT ke print se milan ho sake lekin us print raseed kii ginati kii vyavastha nahin he, us printig kii ginati sirf ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad ho sakati he
 The Election Commission should arrange such that the EVM count of at least 25 per cent of the booth vote in every assembly or Lok Sabha or election should be matched with the VVPAT slip
 wo 25 fisadi booth kaa chayan random tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he, yaa pratyaashiyon kii icchaanusaar ho saktaa he
 At 25 per cent booth, you make slip count mandatory, only then VVPAT will be used effectively
 nahin to koun kab aapatti daayar karata he, phir court jaataa he, phir faisla aata he, ayukta mahoday ye bahut lambii prakriya he ise hamen saral bananaa hi hoga
 My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it
 main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! You said, "looking forward to evolve sir, you are looking for further improvement sir, further improvement is only possible when we accept the principle that yes there are certain problems within our systems
 If we keep repeating again and again it's not possible
 
 
 
 ye to asambhav he
 
 ye to ho hi nahin saktaa
 
 
 "then no improvement can happen after this
 further improvement kii sambhavanaayen rah nahin jaatin
 So my Humble submission is what has been shown so far in the presentation
 hamen aisa lagata he ki jab tak aap imposible kehete rahenge, hamaare saamne har baar kehete rahenge
 The scope of our conversation will decrease
 hamaare prashn uthaane ke scope kam hote jaaenge
 And the scopes of farther improvement go absolutely zero
 pregentation main diarective principles kii tarah thi
 Wish was like a list
 ek adarsh chunaav vyavastha kya ho sakati he, uske bare main thi
 Very good
 lekin aapke puure prajentation ko main dekhuun to do pillar par aadhaarit he
 The first is that our EVM is non-tempering
 doosraa hamaara administrative sefguard bahut surakshit he
 It is very good
 donon par bharosa karke aap kah rahe hai ki iviem kii tempring nahin ho sakati
 It has been given many times that no one can read the chip
 agar chip ko programing karne ke baad chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa to iskaa matlab ham sirf software ko lod karne vaali company ke bharose par ye kah rahe hai ki us company ne- hamane usko software kaa proto tip bataaya, usne wo software banaakar us chip main lod kar diya he
 None of us know what software is in it, we don't know what software is in it
 kyonki uske software ko read nahin kiya ja saktaa, ham admit kar rahe hai
 This means that the Election Commission has trust information, we cannot guarantee that the software it has inserted, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 That the software he uploaded
 doosraa, aapane kaha madraboard, usamen aapane kaha ki first level chekup hota he, or first level chekup ke dauraan ham dekhte hai
 You used a term that if the motherboard was changed, then it would be known during the first level checkup
 sar, main poochna chahta hum, jaankaree ke liye kya first level chekup ke dauraan aapaki company ke engeenior mashin ko khol kar madraboard check karte hai
 Because when your demonstration was happening here
 to unase main categorical ye baat poochi thi ki aap engeenior jab jate hai first lavale chekup karne to kya aap mashin ko andar se khol kar madraboard kii checking tak jate hai yaa nahin? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 agar ham first level chekup par mashin ko us level tak hi nahin kholte hai to, how can we say agar madraboard change hua hoga to hamako pataa chal jaayegaa ki madraboard change kar diya he kisi ne
 This is important, sir, because the possibility of changing the motherboard, i will talk to you when i come on your second prayer
 isamen kuch saathiyon ne sawaal uthaaya tha, main bas un sawaalon ko thodaa sa anderline karke aage ja rahaa hum for the interest of time ki micro controlar koun banaata he? aap technology koun si yuz kar rahe hai? ye sari technology
 
 
 Because there were safegaurd in your technology, we have installed these safegaurd in machines, we have installed these safegaurd in adminstrations
 
 
 
 This presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 aapako technology main mujhe lagata he technical export ke saath main milakar ek alag se seshan karne chahie
 it should be an open discussion
 jahaan IIT se lekar IIID se lekar achche achche technocrate hamaare desh main hai
 There should be an open discussion sitting with them all
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 What is that technology? Your machine becomes two government companies
 ye bhi usamen rahen
 You gave example, some answers about Bhind
 main frankli abhi usamen kuch konvening nahin lag rahaa he
 It has a few loopholes
 main usko bhi discuss karnaa chaahunga
 You discussed that the German court had said this, you referred to the German court, Sir, the reference to the German court is important
 uskaa principal emportent he
 He said 'it is uncostitutional to rely on technology between voters and results'
 voter or rigelt ke bharose ke bich technology par nirbhar karnaa uncostitutional he, sar, ye mashin ko lekar mere kuch objaraveshan the
 i regarding administrative safeguard with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 kyunki wo bhi hamaare bich main se hi hai
 There are boys and girls who come out from among us all
 ham jaanate hai ki sarkari mashinari kya hoti he? aapke paas jo safeguard hai, agar main usko desi bhashaa main kahuun to wo sarkari afasar or sarkari mashinari ke safeguard hai
 And when we have seen the government machinery, how much politically influent and how many financial influencers have happened, we have seen millions of evidences
 not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life main ham dekhte hai ki hamaare polytical mashinari kitni influence rahati he
 Sir, this administration was before EVM, when we, as a country, as a society, as an administration, we had decided that now we will go to EVM voting through manual voting
 tab hamen isi mashinari main khamiyaan dikhti thim
 Rigging takes place, officers come under influence, officers are intimidated, they are blackmailed
 wo influence hokar riging kara dete hai, booth lut tak kara dete hai
 i was a journalist Sir, i have done journalism for eight to ten years
 maine reporting bhi kii he ki kaise booth lut hoti thi
 i have covered a very remote area and used to get involved in looting machinery booths
 kai baar isiilie to ham evm jaisi technology kii taraf aae ki sef rahen
 Depending on the same officer, we can not be guaranteed just by saying that there will be a very good, very good officer sitting somewhere, and if there is an influential officer sitting somewhere
 sar ham jitani baat kar len yahaan par sef gord kii, main aapako bataata hum sar
 Now elections were held in Delhi, you can say that they were not in your domain but there are some realities that will match everywhere
 sar ellection kamishan ke tamaam adeshon ke baavjood ek inspector jaakar, ek esechao ja kar candidet ko kahata he, bhai prachaar karnaa he to zaraa ek AC lagava do, varanaa tumhaare ladakon ko vahaan khadaa nahin hone duungaa jo parche baant rahe the, sar aapke paas shikaayat karenge aapke paas koi saboot bhi nahin aa paayegaa lakin vahaan ham saare log jaanate hai, hamame se adhiktar log jaanate hai ki agar eemaandaaree se chunaav prachaar ke liye do ladke sadak par khadey kiye jaaen or unako chaar ghante ke liye police apni jeep main le ja kar thane main band kar de, to hamaara chunaav prachar to chaupat ho jaataa he
 And the inspector gives him the contract, if not get one attached, then i see how you do the campaign, i see the other soldier come and say, give uniform money, give two good uniform money, have to bring from Connaught Place
 yah uddhran hai, aise uddhran har ward main hamamen se har koi de saktaa he
 Can give you lots of examples
 sar aapane kaha FLC kaa nimantran jaataa he har partiyon ko usamen bhagidaari karen, isliye maine sar isko shabd diya diarective principles kii tarah se hamane bolaa he
 How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 kitne SDM, kitne tehseeldaar vahaan candidats ko leki yaa polytical party ripregentative ko leki welcomming hote hai
 We all know how much discreasing happens, people of every party sitting here know
 sar main teen chizein rakhana chahta hum yahaan par prapojal ke rup main
 We were constantly hearing that there would be hackathons and i think that is a good thing
 haikethon, aaj kii taarikh main shabd aa gaya he, haikethon koi aparaadh nahin he
 Ethical Hackathon is a term arrived
 to ham athical haikethon karaaen, ham bachein na usase
 You said in your address that we will not conduct hackathons, we will challenge
 sar aapkaa jo chalange kaa scope he pehali baat wo haikethon nahin he kyonki yaa to aap hamen jin pichley paanch chunaavon kii baat ham kar rahe hai, (a) aap hamen mashine openali de dijiye, ham usko hack kar ke dikhaa denge aapako
 (b) If you look because you will say this machines cannot be hacked right now because there is a definition of hacking
 hamaare mitra baithe hai, mere saathi saurav bharadwaj
 They hold 9 years of experience in embedded technology
 ejineering ke baad inhone aaj do din pehle dilli vidhansabha main bhi ek mashin kaa prototip hack kar ke dikhaaya
 Sir, about that machine, i can also guarantee that no one can hack it and show it because we know its code, we can hack it, we can temper it so how much tempering is there because the word you Used, i am using it
 aapane kaha pichley chunaavo main tempring hui thi iskaa pruf do
 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa
 Someone should liberate him a little, put a Liberal approach in it and go with this positive approach because Mishra Saheb also mentioned, we were saying in Punjab too
 bahut saare aise aria hai jahaan bahut saare logon ne affidavit file kiye hai ki maine vot diya tha, meri party jisko maine vot diya tha usko 10 vot aae hai
 And 20 people have filed affidavits saying that we had voted for this party, sir, where did our vote go, how did only 10 come
 to jahaan jahaan aise controvarsial ishyus aae hai, meraa sabamishan sar ye rahegaa ki is tarah ke booth kii mashiinon ko aap apane pojeshan main len, unako yahaan multi party team banaaen, ek magistrate ko baithaaen or unke saamne un logon bulaaen jin logon ne affidavit diya tha
 My first suggestion is that the EVM Election Commissioners should take possession of the places where the candidates are most suspicious of the results and the candidates who are giving affidavits saying that our votes are more than the results of the votes
 Ask them to bring their voters in front of the candidates of all the participating parties, checking the votes of those voters by matching the time according to the affidavit
 Get it done in the presence of CRET
 agar ve sahi kah rahe hai to jaanch kaa vishay he, or yadi ve galat hai to koi baat nahin, main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki unke daawey galat hon kyonki sirf tabhi hamaara loktantr surakshit he! tabhi ham loktantric vyavastha ke anusaar chal paaenge! i appreciate this order of the Election Commission that you have decided to hold all further elections with VVPAT, which is a commendable step for the development of the country
 lekin isamen ek vishesh baat he jo main suzav ke rup main rakh rahaa hum
 When the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that VVPAT should be used in elections, they did not just ask for the installation of VVPAT machine, VVPAT gives us the opportunity to match the print of the VVPAT if there is a problem in the middle of counting of votes
 But there is no arrangement for counting of print receipts, that printing can be counted only after the order of High Court
 chunaav ayog aisi vyavastha kare ki har vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa yaa chunaav main kam se kam 25 fisadi booth ke vot kii EVM kii ginati kaa milan, VVPAT kii parchi ke saath ho
 That 25 percent of the booths can be selected randomly, or as per the wishes of the candidates
 25 fisadi booth par aap parchi kii ginati ko anivaary kar den, tabhi VVPAT kaa prabhavi prayog ho paayegaa
 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin
 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke
 Thanks a lot! agar chip ko programing karne ke baad chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa to iskaa matlab ham sirf software ko lod karne vaali company ke bharose par ye kah rahe hai ki us company ne- hamane usko software kaa proto tip bataaya, usne wo software banaakar us chip main lod kar diya he
 None of us know what software is in it, we don't know what software is in it
 kyonki uske software ko read nahin kiya ja saktaa, ham admit kar rahe hai
 This means that the Election Commission has trust information, we cannot guarantee that the software it has inserted, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 That the software he uploaded
 doosraa, aapane kaha madraboard, usamen aapane kaha ki first level chekup hota he, or first level chekup ke dauraan ham dekhte hai
 You used a term that if the motherboard was changed, then it would be known during the first level checkup
 sar, main poochna chahta hum, jaankaree ke liye kya first level chekup ke dauraan aapaki company ke engeenior mashin ko khol kar madraboard check karte hai
 Because when your demonstration was happening here
 to unase main categorical ye baat poochi thi ki aap engeenior jab jate hai first lavale chekup karne to kya aap mashin ko andar se khol kar madraboard kii checking tak jate hai yaa nahin? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 agar ham first level chekup par mashin ko us level tak hi nahin kholte hai to, how can we say agar madraboard change hua hoga to hamako pataa chal jaayegaa ki madraboard change kar diya he kisi ne
 This is important, sir, because the possibility of changing the motherboard, i will talk to you when i come on your second prayer
 isamen kuch saathiyon ne sawaal uthaaya tha, main bas un sawaalon ko thodaa sa anderline karke aage ja rahaa hum for the interest of time ki micro controlar koun banaata he? aap technology koun si yuz kar rahe hai? ye sari technology
 
 
 Because there were safegaurd in your technology, we have installed these safegaurd in machines, we have installed these safegaurd in adminstrations

 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa
 Someone should liberate him a little, put a Liberal approach in it and go with this positive approach because Mishra Saheb also mentioned, we were saying in Punjab too
 bahut saare aise aria hai jahaan bahut saare logon ne affidavit file kiye hai ki maine vot diya tha, meri party jisko maine vot diya tha usko 10 vot aae hai
 And 20 people have filed affidavits saying that we had voted for this party, sir, where did our vote go, how did only 10 come
 to jahaan jahaan aise controvarsial ishyus aae hai, meraa sabamishan sar ye rahegaa ki is tarah ke booth kii mashiinon ko aap apane pojeshan main len, unako yahaan multi party team banaaen, ek magistrate ko baithaaen or unke saamne un logon bulaaen jin logon ne affidavit diya tha
 My first suggestion is that the EVM Election Commissioners should take possession of the places where the candidates are most suspicious of the results and the candidates who are giving affidavits saying that our votes are more than the results of the votes
 Ask them to bring their voters in front of the candidates of all the participating parties, checking the votes of those voters by matching the time according to the affidavit
 Get it done in the presence of CRET
 agar ve sahi kah rahe hai to jaanch kaa vishay he, or yadi ve galat hai to koi baat nahin, main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki unke daawey galat hon kyonki sirf tabhi hamaara loktantr surakshit he! tabhi ham loktantric vyavastha ke anusaar chal paaenge! i appreciate this order of the Election Commission that you have decided to hold all further elections with VVPAT, which is a commendable step for the development of the country
 lekin isamen ek vishesh baat he jo main suzav ke rup main rakh rahaa hum
 When the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that VVPAT should be used in elections, they did not just ask for the installation of VVPAT machine, VVPAT gives us the opportunity to match the print of the VVPAT if there is a problem in the middle of counting of votes
 But there is no arrangement for counting of print receipts, that printing can be counted only after the order of High Court
 chunaav ayog aisi vyavastha kare ki har vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa yaa chunaav main kam se kam 25 fisadi booth ke vot kii EVM kii ginati kaa milan, VVPAT kii parchi ke saath ho
 That 25 percent of the booths can be selected randomly, or as per the wishes of the candidates
 25 fisadi booth par aap parchi kii ginati ko anivaary kar den, tabhi VVPAT kaa prabhavi prayog ho paayegaa
 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin
 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke
 Thanks a lot! main administrative safeguard ke bare main with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 Because they are also among us
 ham sab logon ke bich main se hi nikal kar aane vaale ladke-ladkiyaan hai
 We know what government machinery is? The safeguard that you have, if i say it in the native language, then they are the safeguard of the government officer and government machinery
 or wo sarkari mashinari kab, kitni politicali influence hoti he or kab kitni financiel influence ho jaati he, iske lakhon evidence ham logon ne dekhen hai
 In not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life, we see how influential our political machinery is
 sar, yahi administration to EVM se pehle tha, jis vakt hamane ek desh ke naate, samaaj ke naate, administration ke naate hamane tay kiya tha ki ab manual voting se EVM kii voting par jaayenge
 At that time, we used to see defects in this machinery
 riging ho jaati he, afasar influence main aa jate hai, afasaron ko daraa diya jaataa he, unako blackmel kar liya jaataa he
 They get into rigging by influencing them, and even rob the booth
 main patrkaar tha sar, aath das saal patrakarita kii he maine
 i have also reported how the booth was robbed
 maine bahut remote aria par bhi ja kar cover kiya he to wo mashinari booth lut main shaamil ho jaati thi
 Many times this is why we came to technology like evm to be safe
 usee afasar ke bharose ham sirf ye kahkar ki vahaan bahut acha, kisi jagah bahut acha afasar baitha hoga, kisi jagah influence afasar bhi baitha hoga to ye garenti nahin ho sakati
 Sir, as much as we can talk about safe guard here, let me tell you sir
 abhi dilli main chunaav hue, aap kah sakate hai ki wo aapke domen main nahin the lekin kuch realitys hai jo har jagah match karengi
 Despite all the orders of the Sir Election Commission, an inspector goes to an SHO and tells the candidate, "brother, if you want to campaign, give me an AC, otherwise your boys will not be allowed to stand there who were distributing leaflets, Sir
" You will complain but you will not have any proof but there are many of us who know, most of us know that if there are two boys standing on the street for honest campaigning Field visit and give them off station can be up to four hours of police in jeeps, we choose Prcr is then destroyed
 or uski theg detaa he inspector ek lagava do nahin to dekhtaa hum kaise campan karte ho, dekhtaa hum doosraa sipaahi aa kar kahata he vardi ke paise de do, do acchhee vardi ke paise de do, kanat place se lani he
 These are quotes, such quotes can be given by every one of us in every ward
 aapako bahut saare udhaaharan de saktaa he
 Sir, you said that flc's invitation goes to all the parties to participate in it, so i gave it the word Sir, we have spoken like directive principals
 efffactiveli jab ham ground par ja kar dekhte he to How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 How many sdms, how many tehsildars are welcoming candidates there or political party representatives
 kitne discoureging hote hai, ye baat ham sab log jaanate he, yahaan baithe hue har party ke log jaanate hai
 Sir, i want to keep three things here as a proposal
 ham log lagaataar sun rahe the ki haikethon hoga or mujhe lagata he ki ye acchhee chiz he
 Hackathon, to date, word has arrived, hackathon is not a crime
 athical haikethon ek shabd aa gaya he
 So let us conduct an ethical hackathon, we should not avoid it
 aapane apane sambodhan main kaha ki ham haikethon nahin karaayenge, ham chalange denge
 Sir, the scope of your challenge is the first thing that is not a hackathon because either you give us the last five elections we are talking about, (a) you give us the machines openly, we will hack it and show it to you
 (b) agar aap kyonki dekhiye aap kahenge abhi is mashiinon ko hack nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki hekking kii ek paribhaasha he
 Our friends are sitting, my partner Sourav Bhardwaj
 ye ambeded technology main 9 saal kaa tajurba rakhte hai
 After engineering, he hacked a prototype of a machine and showed it two days ago in Delhi assembly
 sar us mashin ke bare main, main bhi guarantee le saktaa hum ki usko bhi koi hack karke nahin dikhaa saktaa kyonki ham uskaa code jaanate hai, ham usko hack kar sakate hai, ham temprd kar sakate hai to kitni tempring he usamen kyonki aapane jo shabd istemaal kiya usko istemaal kar rahaa hum
 You said, proof that there was tempering in the last elections
 sar, main aapke saamne apni mashin rakh rahaa hum
 Nobody can give proof of that
 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the
 There are many areas where a lot of people have filed affidavits that i had voted, my party to whom i voted has got 10 votes
 or 20 log affidavit file karke ye kah rahe hai ki hamane to isi party ko vot diya tha sahab, kahaan gaya hamaara vot, sirf 10 kaise aae
 So wherever such revolutionary issues have come, my submission will be that you take the machines of such booths in your position, make them a multi-party team here, sit a magistrate and call those people who have given affidavits in front of them
 Was
 meraa pehla suzav to ye he ki jin jagahon par pratyaashiyon ko parinaamon main gadabadi kii sabase zyada shankaa he, vahaan kii EVM chunaav ayukta apane kabje main len or aise jo pratyaashee jo affidavit dekar kah rahe hai ki hamaare vot nateezon ke vot se zyada hai, unhen sabhi bhaag lene vaale dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke saamne apane voters ko laane ko kahen, shapath patr ke hisaab se samay kaa milan karke un voters ke vot kii jaanch magistrate kii upasthiti main kara len
 If they are right, then it is a matter of investigation, and if they are wrong, then no matter what, i pray to God that their claims are wrong because only then our democracy is safe! Only then will we be able to run according to the democratic system! main chunaav ayog ke is aadesh kii saraahna karata hoon ki aapane aage ke sabhi chunaav VVPAT ke saath karaane kaa nirnay liya he, jo ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saraahneey kadam he
 But there is a special point in this that i am keeping as a suggestion
 mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne jab kaha ki chunaavon main VVPAT kaa istemaal ho to unhone sirf VVPAT mashin lagane ko nahin kaha, VVPAT hamen avasar detaa he ki agar voting se matganana ke bich main koi gadabad ho to, uskaa milan VVPAT ke print se milan ho sake lekin us print raseed kii ginati kii vyavastha nahin he, us printig kii ginati sirf ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad ho sakati he
 The Election Commission should arrange such that the EVM count of at least 25 per cent of the booth vote in every assembly or Lok Sabha or election should be matched with the VVPAT slip
 wo 25 fisadi booth kaa chayan random tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he, yaa pratyaashiyon kii icchaanusaar ho saktaa he
 At 25 per cent booth, you make slip count mandatory, only then VVPAT will be used effectively
 nahin to koun kab aapatti daayar karata he, phir court jaataa he, phir faisla aata he, ayukta mahoday ye bahut lambii prakriya he ise hamen saral bananaa hi hoga
 My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it
 main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! Rigging takes place, officers come under influence, officers are intimidated, they are blackmailed
 wo influence hokar riging kara dete hai, booth lut tak kara dete hai
 i was a journalist Sir, i have done journalism for eight to ten years
 maine reporting bhi kii he ki kaise booth lut hoti thi
 i have covered a very remote area and used to get involved in looting machinery booths
 kai baar isiilie to ham evm jaisi technology kii taraf aae ki sef rahen
 Depending on the same officer, we can not be guaranteed just by saying that there will be a very good, very good officer sitting somewhere, and if there is an influential officer sitting somewhere
 sar ham jitani baat kar len yahaan par sef gord kii, main aapako bataata hum sar
 Now elections were held in Delhi, you can say that they were not in your domain but there are some realities that will match everywhere
 sar ellection kamishan ke tamaam adeshon ke baavjood ek inspector jaakar, ek esechao ja kar candidet ko kahata he, bhai prachaar karnaa he to zaraa ek AC lagava do, varanaa tumhaare ladakon ko vahaan khadaa nahin hone duungaa jo parche baant rahe the, sar aapke paas shikaayat karenge aapke paas koi saboot bhi nahin aa paayegaa lakin vahaan ham saare log jaanate hai, hamame se adhiktar log jaanate hai ki agar eemaandaaree se chunaav prachaar ke liye do ladke sadak par khadey kiye jaaen or unako chaar ghante ke liye police apni jeep main le ja kar thane main band kar de, to hamaara chunaav prachar to chaupat ho jaataa he
 And the inspector gives him the contract, if not get one attached, then i see how you do the campaign, i see the other soldier come and say, give uniform money, give two good uniform money, have to bring from Connaught Place
 yah uddhran hai, aise uddhran har ward main hamamen se har koi de saktaa he
 Can give you lots of examples
 sar aapane kaha FLC kaa nimantran jaataa he har partiyon ko usamen bhagidaari karen, isliye maine sar isko shabd diya diarective principles kii tarah se hamane bolaa he
 How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 kitne SDM, kitne tehseeldaar vahaan candidats ko leki yaa polytical party ripregentative ko leki welcomming hote hai
 We all know how much discreasing happens, people of every party sitting here know
 sar main teen chizein rakhana chahta hum yahaan par prapojal ke rup main
 We were constantly hearing that there would be hackathons and i think that is a good thing
 haikethon, aaj kii taarikh main shabd aa gaya he, haikethon koi aparaadh nahin he
 Ethical Hackathon is a term arrived
 to ham athical haikethon karaaen, ham bachein na usase
 You said in your address that we will not conduct hackathons, we will challenge
 sar aapkaa jo chalange kaa scope he pehali baat wo haikethon nahin he kyonki yaa to aap hamen jin pichley paanch chunaavon kii baat ham kar rahe hai, (a) aap hamen mashine openali de dijiye, ham usko hack kar ke dikhaa denge aapako
 (b) If you look because you will say this machines cannot be hacked right now because there is a definition of hacking
 hamaare mitra baithe hai, mere saathi saurav bharadwaj
 They hold 9 years of experience in embedded technology
 ejineering ke baad inhone aaj do din pehle dilli vidhansabha main bhi ek mashin kaa prototip hack kar ke dikhaaya
 Sir, about that machine, i can also guarantee that no one can hack it and show it because we know its code, we can hack it, we can temper it so how much tempering is there because the word you Used, i am using it
 aapane kaha pichley chunaavo main tempring hui thi iskaa pruf do
 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa

 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin
 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke
 Thanks a lot! sar aapkaa jo chalange kaa scope he pehali baat wo haikethon nahin he kyonki yaa to aap hamen jin pichley paanch chunaavon kii baat ham kar rahe hai, (a) aap hamen mashine openali de dijiye, ham usko hack kar ke dikhaa denge aapako
 (b) If you look because you will say this machines cannot be hacked right now because there is a definition of hacking
 hamaare mitra baithe hai, mere saathi saurav bharadwaj
 They hold 9 years of experience in embedded technology
 ejineering ke baad inhone aaj do din pehle dilli vidhansabha main bhi ek mashin kaa prototip hack kar ke dikhaaya
 Sir, about that machine, i can also guarantee that no one can hack it and show it because we know its code, we can hack it, we can temper it so how much tempering is there because the word you Used, i am using it
 aapane kaha pichley chunaavo main tempring hui thi iskaa pruf do
 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa
 Someone should liberate him a little, put a Liberal approach in it and go with this positive approach because Mishra Saheb also mentioned, we were saying in Punjab too
 bahut saare aise aria hai jahaan bahut saare logon ne affidavit file kiye hai ki maine vot diya tha, meri party jisko maine vot diya tha usko 10 vot aae hai
 And 20 people have filed affidavits saying that we had voted for this party, sir, where did our vote go, how did only 10 come
 to jahaan jahaan aise controvarsial ishyus aae hai, meraa sabamishan sar ye rahegaa ki is tarah ke booth kii mashiinon ko aap apane pojeshan main len, unako yahaan multi party team banaaen, ek magistrate ko baithaaen or unke saamne un logon bulaaen jin logon ne affidavit diya tha
 My first suggestion is that the EVM Election Commissioners should take possession of the places where the candidates are most suspicious of the results and the candidates who are giving affidavits saying that our votes are more than the results of the votes
 Ask them to bring their voters in front of the candidates of all the participating parties, checking the votes of those voters by matching the time according to the affidavit
 Get it done in the presence of CRET
 agar ve sahi kah rahe hai to jaanch kaa vishay he, or yadi ve galat hai to koi baat nahin, main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki unke daawey galat hon kyonki sirf tabhi hamaara loktantr surakshit he! tabhi ham loktantric vyavastha ke anusaar chal paaenge! i appreciate this order of the Election Commission that you have decided to hold all further elections with VVPAT, which is a commendable step for the development of the country
 lekin isamen ek vishesh baat he jo main suzav ke rup main rakh rahaa hum
 When the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that VVPAT should be used in elections, they did not just ask for the installation of VVPAT machine, VVPAT gives us the opportunity to match the print of the VVPAT if there is a problem in the middle of counting of votes
 But there is no arrangement for counting of print receipts, that printing can be counted only after the order of High Court
 chunaav ayog aisi vyavastha kare ki har vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa yaa chunaav main kam se kam 25 fisadi booth ke vot kii EVM kii ginati kaa milan, VVPAT kii parchi ke saath ho
 That 25 percent of the booths can be selected randomly, or as per the wishes of the candidates
 25 fisadi booth par aap parchi kii ginati ko anivaary kar den, tabhi VVPAT kaa prabhavi prayog ho paayegaa
 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga

 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure

 Thanks a lot! sar us mashin ke bare main, main bhi guarantee le saktaa hum ki usko bhi koi hack karke nahin dikhaa saktaa kyonki ham uskaa code jaanate hai, ham usko hack kar sakate hai, ham temprd kar sakate hai to kitni tempring he usamen kyonki aapane jo shabd istemaal kiya usko istemaal kar rahaa hum
 You said, proof that there was tempering in the last elections
 sar, main aapke saamne apni mashin rakh rahaa hum
 Nobody can give proof of that
 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the
 There are many areas where a lot of people have filed affidavits that i had voted, my party to whom i voted has got 10 votes
 or 20 log affidavit file karke ye kah rahe hai ki hamane to isi party ko vot diya tha sahab, kahaan gaya hamaara vot, sirf 10 kaise aae
 So wherever such revolutionary issues have come, my submission will be that you take the machines of such booths in your position, make them a multi-party team here, sit a magistrate and call those people who have given affidavits in front of them
 Was
 meraa pehla suzav to ye he ki jin jagahon par pratyaashiyon ko parinaamon main gadabadi kii sabase zyada shankaa he, vahaan kii EVM chunaav ayukta apane kabje main len or aise jo pratyaashee jo affidavit dekar kah rahe hai ki hamaare vot nateezon ke vot se zyada hai, unhen sabhi bhaag lene vaale dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke saamne apane voters ko laane ko kahen, shapath patr ke hisaab se samay kaa milan karke un voters ke vot kii jaanch magistrate kii upasthiti main kara len
 If they are right, then it is a matter of investigation, and if they are wrong, then no matter what, i pray to God that their claims are wrong because only then our democracy is safe! Only then will we be able to run according to the democratic system! main chunaav ayog ke is aadesh kii saraahna karata hoon ki aapane aage ke sabhi chunaav VVPAT ke saath karaane kaa nirnay liya he, jo ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saraahneey kadam he
 But there is a special point in this that i am keeping as a suggestion
 mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne jab kaha ki chunaavon main VVPAT kaa istemaal ho to unhone sirf VVPAT mashin lagane ko nahin kaha, VVPAT hamen avasar detaa he ki agar voting se matganana ke bich main koi gadabad ho to, uskaa milan VVPAT ke print se milan ho sake lekin us print raseed kii ginati kii vyavastha nahin he, us printig kii ginati sirf ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad ho sakati he
 The Election Commission should arrange such that the EVM count of at least 25 per cent of the booth vote in every assembly or Lok Sabha or election should be matched with the VVPAT slip
 wo 25 fisadi booth kaa chayan random tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he, yaa pratyaashiyon kii icchaanusaar ho saktaa he
 At 25 per cent booth, you make slip count mandatory, only then VVPAT will be used effectively
 nahin to koun kab aapatti daayar karata he, phir court jaataa he, phir faisla aata he, ayukta mahoday ye bahut lambii prakriya he ise hamen saral bananaa hi hoga
 My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it
 main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you

 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he

 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores

 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke
 Thanks a lot! meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin

 Thanks a lot! main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition

 bahut bahut dhanyavad! Thanks a lot! team india semifinal mukaable main newjiland se 18 ranon se harkar bhale hi world cap se baahar ho gai he, lekin toornament main use kuch sakaraatmak chijen bhi hasil hui hai
 At one time Team India was known for its weak bowling, but in this World Cup, its bowlers made the path easier for the batsmen on many occasions
 wo chaahe pehle gendbaaji ho yaa baad main, bhartiya gendbaaj har maukey par apane captain ke ummiido par khare utre
 You can gauge the strength of Indian bowling by the fact that before Bhuvneshwar Kumar was injured, a bowler like Mohammed Shami was sitting on the bench
