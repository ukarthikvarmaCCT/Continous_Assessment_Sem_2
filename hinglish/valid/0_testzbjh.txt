 where Baruth de Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Jewish descent
 unka parivartit naam 'benedict di spinoja' tha
 He showed remarkable scientific aptitude, but the importance of his works could be realized only after his death
 spinoja kaa janm holland main, yahudee parivaar main, san 1632 main hua tha
 He was reclusive, fearless and uninterested by nature
 apane vishwaason ko tyaagane ke liye unako lobh dikhaaya gaya, unki hatya kaa shadyantr rachaa gaya, unhen yahudee sampradaay se bahishkrut kiya gaya, phir bhi ve adig rahe
 Worldly life seemed to him like an intolerable disease
 at: usase mukti paane tathaa ishwarprapti ke liye ve baichaiyn rahete the
 Spinoza's most famous treatise is his 'ethics'
 kintu iske atirikt bhi unhone saat yaa aath granthon kaa pranayan kiya he
 Principles of Philosophy and Metaphysical Cogitations were published in 1663 and Tractatus Theologico Polyticus in 1670, without his name
 unke teen adhure granthtrectatus polyticas, trectatus di intelectus emagedateon, gramatices lingue hebrasi hai - jo unke mukhya granth athiks ke saath, unki mrityu ke uparaant usee saal 1677 main prakashit hue
 Many days later, another treatise, Tractetus Brevis de Dio, was published in 1858
 spinoja ke jivan tathaa darshan ke vishay main anek granth likhe gaye hai jinaki suchi spinoja in da lite ov vedant main di gai he
 The idea that matter can be a creation of matter, so ideology and expansion are matter, Spinoza protested
 dravya, swayamprakash or swatantra he, uski sristi nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, ideology and expansion, which are created, are not titles but degrees
 spinoja anishvaravaadi is arth main kahe ja sakate hai ki unhone yahudee dharm tathaa isai dharm main prachlit ishwar kii kalpana kaa virodh kiya
 Spinoza's substance or God is nirguna, formless and personless omnipresent
 kisi bhi prakaar ishwar ko vishisht rup dena usko simit karnaa he
 In this sense the God of Spinoza is similar to the Brahman of Advaita Vedanta
 jis prakaar brahm kii do oopaadhiyaan, naam or rup hai, usee prakaar spinoja ke dravya kii do oopaadhiyaan vichaar or vistaar hai
 These are not properties of matter
 brahm ke swaroopalakshan ke samaan dravya ke bhi gun hai jo uske swaroop se hi siddh ho jate hai, jaise uski adwitiyata, swatantraaa, purnataa aadi
 It is more aforementioned to call thought and extension not a virtue, because according to Spinoza they are charged by the intellect to understand the nature of matter
 is prakaar kii anant oopaadhiyaan spinoja ko maanya hai
 These titles of God are also infinite, but the infinitude of God is absolute and the infinity of these titles is relative
 ishwar jagat kaa srashta he, parantu is rup main nahin ki vah apni ichhashakti se sampurna vishwa kii rachana karata he
 To really impose a will in God is to limit it
 parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki ishwar swatantra nahin he; uski swatantraaa uski sarvanirpekshata he na ki swantatra ichha isi se spinoja sristi ko saprayojan nahin maanata
 The reason for the god world is in the same sense as the golden ornament or the sky triangle
 parantu iskaa yah arth nahin ki ishwar parivartansheel he
 The world is fictitious, but its basis is true God
 ishwar or jagat vibhinn hai, parantu vibhakt nahin
 Just as God does not have the willpower, in the same way there is no thing called free will in man
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki prayek vichaar kaa kaaran ek anya vichaar hua karata he at: koi bhi vichaar swatantra nahin he
 Also, the physical world is not affected by Spinoza's thinking
 kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa alag hai parantu donon ek hi dravya, he at: ve sambandhit maaloom padate hai
 In practice, Spinoza seems deterministic
 unka kahana he ki ichhashakti ke asweekaar karne se hamaare vyavhaar tathaa aachaar par prabhaav nahin padataa at: usase sarshak hona anaavashyak he
 The reality is that if we are determined that the work-cause-chain of the world is independent, then we will have great peace
 manushya tabhi tak ashaant rahata he jab tak uskosh kaary kaaran-shrunkhlaa main parivartan kii aashaa rahati he
 Belief in free will is our bond
 ichaswatantray kaa upyog ichaswatantray ke niraakaran ke liye karnaa chahie
 With the suppression of the will of the independent, the princely instinct and mental disorders are quenched and the mind is capable of divination
 jivan kaa param lakshya ishwar kii prapti he kyoki tabhi nityashubh kii prapti ho sakati he
 The attainment of God comes from loving God, but love does not mean sentimentality but emotionality
 isi se spinoja ne is prem ko bauddhik prem kaha he
 One meaning of divinity is that we do virtue for virtue, because wishing for reward in virtue of virtue is the creation of a bond
 jab hamaara man ishwarmay tathaa hamaara drushtikon nity kaa drushtikon ho jaataa he tab ham ishwar ke saath tadatmya kaa anubhav karte hai tathaa param shanti praapt karte hai
 In Spinoza's view, the virtuous form of God is also important
 jinka bauddhik str nicha he tathaa jinke man main sagun, saakaar ishwar kii kalpana se dharmbhaavna jaagrath hoti he unke liye yah kalpana atyant upyogi he
 It is better to believe in God than to realize God more than not to believe in God
 spinoja kaa vichaar sarvadharmanirpeksh tha, isi se aaj ke yug main logon kii drushti spinoja kii ore baar baar ja rahi he

 laharon kii ek lahar tanks main apvartan kii tasviir
 Refraction of n2> n1, with light at the interface between two media of different refractive indices
 Since the phase velocity is lower in the other medium, the angle of refraction θ2 is less than the angle of incidence θ1, that is, the beam in the higher medium index is closer to normal

 Diagram of refraction of water waves
 In light, refraction occurs when waves travel through a medium with a refractive index to a medium with each other at a given angle
 At the boundary between media, the wave's phase velocity changes, usually due to a change in direction
 Its wavelength increases or decreases but its frequency remains constant
 For example, as a light beam enters and leaves the glass refract, assuming there is a change in the refractive index
 Traveling with a normal ray will change the speed, but not the direction
 Refraction still occurs in this case
 Understanding this concept led to the invention of the lens and the refractory telescope
 Refraction can be seen when looking at a bowl of water
 Air has a refractive index of about 1
0003, and water has a refractive index of about 1
33
 If a person sees a straight object, a pencil or straw, placed in a slant as if partially in water, is seen turning the object on the surface of the water
 This is due to the bending of light rays as they move from water to air
 Once the rays reach the eye, the eye traces back as those straight lines
 Lines of sight are shown where the actual rays intersect at a higher position than that generated
 This causes the pencil to appear higher and water will appear shallower than it really is
 The depth that appears to be water when viewed from above is known as the apparent depth
 This is an important consideration for spearfishing from the surface because it appears to be in a different place for the target fish, and the fisher should be fishing for the lower target
 The diagram on the right shows an example of refraction in water waves
 The ripples travel from the left and pass over an inclined field at an angle to a shallower wavefront
 If the waves travel more slowly in shallower water, the wavelength decreases and the wave bends at the boundary
 The dotted line represents the boundary normal
 The dashed line represents the original direction of the waves
 This incident explains why waves on a shoreline strike the shore near a straight angle
 As the waves travel from deep water into shallower waters near the coast, they are refracted from their original direction of travel to a normal angle to the shoreline and refraction
 It is also for the rainbow and is responsible for the sharing of white light in a rainbow spectrum as it passes through a glass prism
 The glass has a high air-refractive index
 When a beam of white light varies with the frequency of refraction, a dispersion known as a In which different components of white colored light are refracted at different angles, ie, having an index of incidence passes through the air in the material, they are separately quantified at the bend interface, so that they are separated
 Different colors correspond to different frequencies
 While refraction allows for beautiful phenomena such as rainbows, it can also produce strange optical phenomena, such as mirage and mirage
 This is caused by changes in the refractive index of air with these temperatures
 Recently some metamaterials which have created a negative refractive index
 With metamaterials, we can also obtain the total refraction phenomenon when the wave impedances of the two media are matched
 There is no reflected wave
 Also, since refraction can make objects appear closer than they are, this is responsible for allowing water to magnify objects
 The first is As light enters a drop of water, it slows down
 If the surface of the water is not flat, the light will be bent in a new way
 This round shape turns the light out and as it expands out, the image you see becomes larger
 For a useful analogy in explaining refraction of light, imagine a marching band as they march mud from the pavement at an oblique angle
 Will be in The side is that the passengers on the run in the mud will slow down first
 This causes the entire band to pivot slightly towards the normal

 dhwani - vigyaan In underwater acoustics, refraction is the bending or curving of a sound ray that results when the ray passes through a gradient from a region of sound speed to a field of a different speed
 The amount of bending ray is dependent on the amount of difference between the speed of sound, that is, there is a variation in temperature, salinity, and water pressure
 Similar acoustics effects are also found in the Earth's atmosphere 

 has been known for centuries
 There have been phenomena of sound refraction in the atmosphere, however, starting in the 1970s, comprehensive analysis of the effect of urban highways and noise bending to address meteorological effects of barriers Came into circulation through Ijaining sound rays in the lower atmosphere

 But until 1912, there was no idea of the wave nature of the x ray until Van Lauey proved it
 ab yah aashaa hui ki eks-re sookshmdarshi banaaya ja saktaa he
 So this idea was abandoned at that time
 kuch varshon baad 1923 i
 main da broggli ne electron kii tarang prakruti ko nishchit kiya or neuyark main 1927 i
 main davisan or germar ne tathaa abrdin main ji

 Electron beam can also be twisted by suitable electric or magnetic fields
 aise sookshmdarshi jinhen safaltaapurvak upyog main laayaa ja saktaa tha 1947 i
 main nol, rask or brukh ne prastut kiye
 The wavelength of this radiation is expressed by the following relation
 yahan h plank kaa niyatank he, m electron kaa dravyaman or q veg hai
 Velocity is the function of voltage, which is used to accelerate the electron beam
 is sookshmdarshi se 10 A° tak vibhedan sambhav tha or isaki aavardhan kshamta bahut adhik thi
 Objects of 1
6
10-8 mm extension can be seen by this
 nihsandeh yah badi thos pragati he or iske saath-saath anek nae avishkaar jude hue hai
 Today, electron microscopy has many techniques of its own
 ucch urja electron kii bhanti laghutarangdairghy ke saath-saath eks kirnon main vedhankshmata bahut adhik hoti he or ve kam shighrata se avashoshit bhi hoti hai
 Thus, x rays can be used to determine the internal structure of small opaque objects
 eranverkh ne 1947 i
 main pehla eks kiran sookshmdarshi yaa chaaya sookshmdarshi nikaala or 1948 i
 main kink patric or bejay ne uskaa sudhaar kiya
 Like an electron microscope, vacuum is not required here
 achche pratibimb ke liye keval sookshm chhidr kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This means that less radiation enters and hence exposures are much larger
 peeche chitra kaa bada vistaar karnaa padataa he jiske liye bahut sookshm kanon kaa paayas aavashyak hota he
 Now let us look at general visible light microscopy
 iske purv ki ham us disha main hua pragati par vichaar-vimarsh kare, hamen un aakankshaon par dhyaan rakhana hoga jo 40 varsh purv sookshmdarshikividon kii thi
 It was not possible to fulfill all the requirements with a single device
 vibhedan kshamta main vruddhi sankhyatmak dwarak ke maan se simit ho jaati he jiskaa maan 1
5 se adhik nahin ho saktaa
 There is also a limit to the increase of the magnification capacity of the system
 yah prayukt leson kii focus duriyon kaa falan he
 Magnification is the inverse function of the focus distance, so the lack of focus distance leads to magnification
 par saath hi kriyaatmak duuri nasht ho jaati he
 Because of such ideas, Birch built reflective microscopes in 1947 in Bristol using mirrors in place of lenses
 siddhantat: parabangnee kiran tak vikiran kaa upyog yahan sambhav ho sakaa
 It has a lower numeric gateway but has the advantage of greater achromaticity and greater functional distance
 chunki quartz 2000 A° tak vikiran kaa avasorana nahin karata isliye us sookshmdarshi se jisamen kwatarj lenson kaa upyog hota he, kam se kam vibhedan duuri 1,000 A° praapt hogi at: is prakaar ke vinyas ke saath parabangnee vikiran ke upyog se 'parabangnee sookshmdarshi' kaa nirmaan hota he
 If an ordinary light microscope is used to collect radiation scattered by small objects, this type of arrangement is called a microscope
 pro jernik ne sookshmdarshi main kala vaishamy pradipti kaa upyog kiya
 This technology was called art contrast microscope
 yah rangahin visheshat: paardarshak padaarthon kii sanrachana dikhaane kii vidhi he
 Differentiation is seen in them due to different structures, such as in the frog's liver
 vaishamy ko sudhaarney ke liye jaivikivid ranjakon kii sahaayta lete hai
 This is usually done with contrasting color filters
 dhruvit prakaash se kuch hi kism ke crystalon kaa vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he par kalavaishamy se sab prakaar ke crystalon kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique does not use artificial colors as a stain
 abhiranjan main dosha yah bataaya jaataa he ki yadhyapi abhiranjan jeevon kaa koshikaon ko nasht nahin karata he, tathaapi aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vah jeevon yaa koshikaon ko bilkul prabhavit nahin karata
 The advantage of art-contrast method is that illumination, which is required in every microscope, does not require anything else to see the organism
 kala vaishamy sookshmdarshi main sookshmdarshi saamaanya kism kaa hi rahata he
 There is only this novelty that a new light device is added
 pa ek kaanch kaa plate he jisamen ek valayakaar khaanchaa he
 The plate is coated with a transparent coating of calcium fluoride
 lep kii motaai ek si rahati he
 In vacuum, evaporation is plastered
 lep kii motaai thik itani rahati he ki khaanchaa or plate ke anya bhaag dwaara paarit prakaash ke bich ke samay kaa antar kampan kaa chaturthaansh rahe
 There is a curtain in which there is a annular cut which passes through as much light in the landscape as it would fill in the grooves of the Kalapatta
 vastu dwaara bikharit or vivartit prakaash khaanche dwaara paarit nahin hota or yah prakaash jab pratibimb par pahunchataa he, tab vah strot se sidhe pahunche prakaash se mila hua nahin hota he or vyatikaran chitra banataa he
 This is reflected in the actress
 vastu ke vibhinn ang apvartanaank ke anusaar prakaash main vibhinn kalantar pradarshit karte hai at: abhinytra main dikhaai padane vaala pratibimb vastu kaa apvartanaank chitra hota he
 This microscope became available for use by 1952 AD
 1952 i
 main is uplabdhi ke liye pro jernik ko nobel puraskaar mila
 Dyson solved this problem differently in 1951, which led to the creation of interfacing microscopes that had some superiority over conventional articular microscopes
 isamen vastu kii kaanch ke do ardhrajtit patton ke madhya main dabaa diya jaataa he or use ek vishesh darpan pranali se is prakaar dekha jaataa he ki kuch prakaash abhinaytrak main bina vastu se paarit hue sidhaa chalaa jaae or shesh prakaash vastu se hokar jaae
 The expressed expression thus expresses the refractive index structure of the finge object
 vastut: do prakaar kii yah pradipti dhundli prishthbhumi or kalavaishamy maanav ke liye ek bada mahatv kaa saadhan he
 The blurred background illumination has proven useful in observing extremely fine particles, and art contrast illumination has increased the technical possibility of knowing the minimum change in optical density so that reflection can be easily explained
 ham dekhte hai ki chalis varsh purv ke sookshmdarshividon kii anek aakankshaayen puri ho gai hai
 This is not the end here because there is no end of research and the same is for microscopy and efforts are still being made to increase the above limit of differentiation capacity of magnification capacity
 nae kism ke kaanch or plastic ke upyog se sookshmdarshiki kii takneekee main or bhi pragati hona anivaary he
 From all these microscopes, which have been described, only in detail can be obtained
 sookshmdarshiki kii or shakha he jo badi shandaar or rochak he
 This is the light resolution microscope
 iske dwaara gaharaai main bhi vibhedan maaloom kiya ja saktaa he
 It has proven to be excellent in depth resolution
 yah prakashkeey or vyaktikaranmapiya takneekee he jise prakaash cat, prakaash profile, bahulit kiran punj phizo franj or samaan varnik koti ke franj ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The sensitive methods of these surface investigations can be successfully varied up to molecular magnitude

 On the other hand, the Russians had spread Siberia and Kamchatka as part of their empire and spread from north to south in these islands

 bhaktikaal ke kaviyon main swami agradas ke shishy nabhadas kaa vishisht sthaan he
 Their dates of birth and death are uncertain due to lack of vision
 mishrabandhu, dow shyamsundardaas, acharya ramchandra shukla, dow dindayalu gupt, acharya kshitimohan sen aadi ne is sambandh main jo tithiyaan nirdhaarit kii hai unamem paryaapt antar he
 His famous treatise 'bhaktamala' was written by Priyadas ji in 1769, a hundred years later
 is aadhaar par nabhadas kaa samay 17veen shatabdi ke madhya or uttarardh ke bich mana jaataa he
 In the absence of evidence regarding the birthplace, parents, caste etc
 of Nabdas, nothing can be said rightfully
 'bhaktanamavali' ke sampadak shri radhakrishnadas ne kinvadanti ke aadhaar par likhaa he ki nabhadas janmaandh the or baalyavastha main hi inke pita kii mrityu ho gai
 At that time there was a situation of famine in the country, so mother could not raise them and left them in the forest
 sanyogvash shri keelh or agradas ji usee van main hokar ja rahe the, unhone balak ko dekha or uthaa le aae
 Later, with the influence of the same Mahatmas, Nabdas received the light of the eyes and Agradas ji initiated him
 parampara ke anusaar nabhadas dom athwa maharashtriya brahman jati ke the
 The commentator Priyadas has considered him a Hanuman dynasty Maharashtrian Brahmin
 tikaakar rupakala ji ne inhen dom jati kaa maanate hue likhaa he ki dom neech jati nahin thi, varan kalavant, dhaadhi, bhaat, dom aadi ganvidyapraveen jatiyon ke hi naam hai
 The Mishrabandhu also wrote that considering them Hanumanvanshi, the word Hanuman is used for 'dom' in Marwadi
 nabhadas kii teen kritiyaan uplabdh hai - 'bhaktamaal', 'ashtyam', 'rambhakti sambandhi sfoot pad'
 'bhaktamal' has a character song of about two hundred devotees
 'ashtyam' brajabhasha gadhy or padya donon main pruthak-pruthak uplabdh he
 Rama Sambadhi Sphoot posts are mentioned in the search reports
 in teenon kritiyon main nabhadas kii kirti kaa mul aadhaar 'bhaktamaal' hi he
 Its oldest copy has not been produced yet and neither has the scientific editing of this book been done
 at: mul rup main iskaa kya aakaar tha, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa
 According to some scholars, it had 108 verses similar to beads of the rosary
 parantu sanwat 1770 kii prati main isaki chhandasankhya 194 he
 In the famous commentary by Priyadas, 214 verses are given and Acharya Shukla considers 316 verses in it
 mul aakaar jo bhi rahaa ho, 'bhaktamaal' main nabhadas ne chappay chand main apane purvavarti athwa samasamyik lagbhag do sau bhakton kaa charitagan kiya he
 The poet did not express special interest in calculating the dates of death or other physical facts of these devotees
 bhakton ke jivan kii alokik ghatnaon kaa varnan kar janata ke hriday main unke jivanadarshon ke prati aasthaa utpann karnaa hi kavi kaa mul lakshya rahaa he
 In Charitavarna, Nabdas has often compiled material from three sources - legends, religious texts and his own knowledge of contemporary devotees
 nabhadas ne yahan kisi prakaar kaa pakshpaat nahin kiya; nirgun athwa sagun vichaardhaara ke sabhi bhakton ke prati man main samaan shraddha he
 It is a must that nothing is said in 'bhaktamala' in relation to devotees like Malukdas Dharamdas, Dadudayal, Nanak, etc
 kintu iskaa bhi kaaran ragadwesh kii bhaavana nahin he
 Perhaps there was no definite list of the devoted devotees of Nabhadas, or the poet may not have remembered the names of these saints
 'bhaktamaal' kii rachana vrajabhasha main hui he
 Its language style is mature and refined
 charit varnan main kavi ne samaas style kaa hi avlamban kiya he
 This type of poisoning often has the possibility of expansion, but Nawabdas has introduced uncommon authority over language and has often described the major qualities of a particular devotee in a single verse
 samaas kaa prayog hone par bhi 'bhaktamaal' kii bhashaa main prasadgun kaa abhaav nahin hua
 Many lines of his verses have become euphemistic due to brief and direct expression
 bhakton or bhaktakaviyon ke jeevancharit ko surakshit rakhane main 'bhaktamaal' kaa yogadan atyant mahatvapurn he
 Many scholars like Priyadas, Vaishnavadas, Laldas, Balkaram, Roopkala, Malukdas, etc
 have accepted the glory of the presented text by presenting various commentaries on this book
 tikaakaron ke atirikt aage chalakar anek kaviyon ne bhi isi aadhaar par vibhinn bhaktamalon or parachaiyon kii rachana kar ek naveen parampara ko janm diya
 In devout society, 'bhaktamal' has been as popular as 'ramcharit'

 From June 1959, started writing duly
 surendra choudhary kii pehali prakashit rachana ek aalochanatmak niabandh thi, jo babu gulabry dwaara sampadit 'sahitya sandesh' main 1951 main prakashit hua tha
 In the beginning, he also wrote many poems and a story; But mainly he chose 'hindi Criticism' as his field of work and for this he prepared fully
 1950 ke baad jo peedi hindi sahitya main aayi, usamen surendra choudhary behad padhaaku the
 He studied Sangopang of ancient Indian poetry
 aagam-nigam, sahitya, darshan, jyotish aadi sabakaa or angreji ke madhyam se uplabdh praayah videshi sahitya ke clasix kaa or curent litarechar ke bahulansh kaa bhi uttam adhyayan-manan unhone kiya tha

 hindi kahani-samiksha ko vaastavik arthon main santulit aalochana kaa swaroop pradaan karne main surendra choudhary, devishankar avasthi evam da0 namvar singh kaa aitihaasik yogadan he
 Summing up the time to some more later, Madhuresh ji believes that the most capable critic among these was Surendra Chaudhary
 aalochana ke sahi arth main hindi kahani-aalochana kii pehali pustak surendra choudhary kii hi thi - 'hindi kahani : prakriya or paath'
 Its first edition was published in September 1963 from Bharti Bhawan, Patna
 shambhu gupt maanate hai ki nissandeh jab yah pustak likhi gayi thi or chhapakar saamne aayi thi tab yah adwitiya thi
 Then there was almost zero situation in the field of story-criticism in Hindi
 is pustak ke rup main surendra choudhary ne shunya se shikhar kii yatra tay kar daali
 Explaining the structure of the story, the balanced form of the composition of the story as a creative expression of the hold and combination of creative reality, interdependence of narrative and craft and relative life-wisdom is the norm even today
 kahani kii prakriya evam paath ko alag-alag khandon main niojit-vivechit karne ko aitihaasik seemaa ke rup main bhi dekha gaya he or vaicharik patibaddhta se gurej ko iskaa kaaran mana gaya he, lekin un khandon ko alag-alag padhate hue bhi koi sajag pathak sahaj rup se swatah lakshith kar saktaa he ki na to unki 'prakriya' paath se virahit he or na hi unka 'paath' prakriya se bhinn
 Both of them are unsuitable
 phir bhi 'paath' kii alag se aavashyaktaa kahani kii puri aantarik anviti evam sthapaty kaa samekit swaroop dikhalaane ke liye he, jisase yah samagrata main spasht ho paata he ki kis tarah or kyon koi kahani ek 'safal kahani' he
 In the absence of this, the Hindi story-review from the beginning to the end is under the grip of a catastrophic disorientation under which sometimes a story is praised / blasphemed due to an idea or sometimes it is in the name of modernism
 He is fascinated
 samgr rup main kahani ko dekhne ke abhaav main hi kai aalochakon ko suchanaatmak upadesh kii vachaalata bhi gher leti he jise ve khud kii bahujyata maanakar garvanvit mahasoos karte hai

 He was not committed as a politics of bending and overthrow, but how much he was committed to literature and wisdom with life-wisdom, every article of his tells, because of this deep respect for Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma
 Despite this, he has been able to take a completely different approach from Yashpal and Renu, with full tenacity
 or iske liye unhen kisi 'palimix ' kii jarurat nahin padi
 He praised the stories of Premchand, even the stories of the unknowable, and did so on his own, not in the absence of ideological commitment, but which is also relative to being independent, and readers like Premchand, to any other narrator in Hindi Did not get any luck, but the readers of Agnayya did not get the readers or what the 'pathak' reviewers, the creators themselves, did not even notice, how to say so Can be obtained? Yes, the reader is not the criterion and how can this happen? surendra choudhary ko samajhane tathaa unke moolyankan ko lekar bhi da0 manager pandeya ke do kathan bade kaam ke hai - "surendra choudhary aise aalochak hai jinaki aalochana main gambheer sahitya-vivek he or uskaa jivan-vivek tathaa jagat-vivek se gaharaa sambandh he
 Whether he criticizes 'new story' and later stories, analyzes of 'godan', delineates 'maila aanchal' or evaluates the 'liberation-context', careful readers of all these are the literature-conscience of Surendra Chaudhary, Life-wisdom and world-wisdom must be interviewed
 " ek or jagah ve unhen hindi kahani kii aalochana ko purnataa pradaan karanevaala maanate hue kehete hai ki " vaise to surendra choudhary kahani ke aalochak ke rup main prasiddh hai lekin ve hindi upanyaas ke bhi ek samarth aalochak hai

 vaidic sahitya nimna bhaagon main banton he- Samhita means collection
 samhitaon main vibhinn devataaon ke stutiparak mantron kaa sankalan he
 The Samhita is four - Rikyajush, Sama and Atharva according to the ancient tradition Vedas are continual and apaurusheya
 unki kabhi manushya dwaara rachana nahin hui
 At the beginning of the creation, God gave light to the sages named Agni, Vayu Aditya and Angira
 prayek vaidic mantra kaa devtaa or rishi hota he
 The one who is praised in the mantra is the deity of that mantra and the one who has first demonstrated the meaning of the mantra is his sage
 paashchaatya vidwaan rishiyon ko hi veda-mantron kaa rachayita maanate hai
 Vedic literature is also called Shruti, because the old sages adopted this literature from the Shravan-tradition
 baad main is gyaan ko samaran karke jo granth likhe gaye, ve smriti kehalaae
 There are four collection of hymns on the top of the scripture
 rugveda main 10,600 mantra or 1,028 sookt hai, ye das mandalon main vibhakt hai
 There are hymns of the gods in the Suktas
 ye badi bhavy, udaatt or kavyamayi hai
 In these, there is a new flight of imagination, maturity of narrative and talent
 ‘ushaa’ aadi kai devataaon ke varnan bade hridaygrahi hai
 Western scholars consider the Samhita of the Rigveda to be the most ancient
 unka vichaar he ki iske adhikansh sookhton kii rachana punjab main hui
 At that time the Aryans were spread across territories from Afghanistan to the ganges-yamuna

 The area of work of the Aryans in the Rigveda is Punjab, kuru-panchal in it

 From this time, the region of ganga-yamuna became the center of Aryan civilization
 rugveda kaa dharm upasna-pradhan tha, kintu yajurveda ke do bhed hai-krishna yajush or shukla yajush
 There is a big difference in the form of both, the first contains only a collection of chants and the second has all the divination with the chanted chants
 isamen gey mantron kaa sangrah he
 On the occasion of Yajna, the God who used to perform the homage, used to sing the praise-mantra of that deity in a proper voice

 Due to their not being written and fixed, some distinctions started to form in the Vedas and their branches developed

 Now only the first branch is available in these

 There are two main branches of Shukla Yajurveda - Madhyandin and Karma

 There is not much difference in them

 In these, the second-third meet the first, there is only a slight difference in the sequence
 chauthi shakha aadhi hi mili he
 This Veda is Brahma Sampradayika
 samaveda kii do shakhaayen thim - kauthum or ranyneey
 Only seventh chapter of Kauthum is found in it
 yah shakha bhi aditya sampradaayaka he
 Two branches of the Atharvaveda are available - Pappalad and Shaunak
 vartmaan samay main shaunak shakha hi purnrup main praapt hoti he, yah shakha adityasampradayika he
 Although the ancient traditions, according to the mantrabrahmanas: Vednamadhyam, Brahmin Vedka is a part
 tathaapi samhitaon ke baad brahman-granthon kaa nirmaan hua mana jaataa he
 There is a detailed description of the rituals of yagyas, as well as etymologies of words and stories of ancient kings and sages and creation-related thoughts
 prayek veda ke apane brahman hai
 The Rigveda has two Brahmins - Aitareya and Kaushitaki
 aitarey main 40 adhyay or aath panchikaaye hai, isamen agnishthom, gavamyan, dwadshah aadi somayaagon, agnihotra tathaa rajyabhishek kaa vistrut aitarey brahman-jaisaa hi he
 They throw a lot of light on the then history

 From Kaushitaki it appears that in North India, a lot of emphasis was given on the proper study of the language
 shukla yajurveda kaa brahman shatapath ke naam se prasiddh he, kyonki isamen sau adhyay hai

 It cannot be used as a tablecloth, or on a platform, it cannot cover an idol or be placed on a cornerstone
 san 2005 tak ise poshaak ke rup main yaa vardi ke rup main prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 But on 5 July 2005, the Government of India amended the Code and allowed the flag to be used as a dress or as a uniform

 prayek desh kaa jhanda ek alag stambh par hona chahie, kisi bhi desh kaa rashtriya dhvaj ek ke upar ek, ek hi stambh par fahraana nahin chahie
 At such a time, the Indian flag should be placed at the beginning, at the end and also placed with other countries in alphabetical order
 yadi jhandon ko golakaar main fahraana ho to rashtriya dhvaj ko chakra ke shuruyaat main rakh kar anya deshon ke jhande ko dakshinavart tareeke se rakhaa janaa chahie, jab tak ki koi dhvaj rashtriya dhvaj ke bagal main na aa jaae
 The national flag of India should always be hoisted first and lowered later
 jab jhande ko guna chihn ke aakaar main rakhaa jaataa he to bhartiya dhvaj ko saamne rakhana chahie or anya dhwajon ko dayee ore hona chahie
 When the UN flag is being hoisted with the Indian flag, it can be displayed on both sides
 saamaanya taur par dhvaj ko disha ke anusaar sabase dayee ore fahraaya jaataa he
 When the flag is being hoisted with other flags, such as corporate flags, advertising banners, other flags are on separate pillars as a rule, the national flag should be in the middle, or to the left for observers or a width from other flags
 Should be high
 rashtriya dhvaj kaa stambh anya stambhon se aage hona chahie, yadi ye ek hi samooh main hai to sabase upar hona chahie
 If the flag is being carried in a procession with other flags then the flag should be at the forefront of the procession, if it is being carried with many flags then it should be at the forefront of the procession
 jab jhanda kisi band kamare main, saarvajanik baithkon main yaa kisi bhi prakaar ke sammelnon main, pradarshit kiya jaataa he to dayee ore rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki yah sthaan adhikarik hota he
 It should be placed on the right hand side of the speaker when the flag is being displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting
 jab ye haul ke anya jagah par pradarshit kiya jaataa he, to use darshakon ke daahine ore rakhaa janaa chahie
 This flag should be fully spread and displayed while keeping the saffron strip on top
 yadi dhvaj ko manch ke peeche kii diwaar par lamb main lataka diya gaya he to, kesaria pattee ko upar rakhte hue darshekon ke saamne rakhana chahie taaki sheersh upar kii ore ho
