 Now the engineers are imagining making 2,000 feet and 3,000 feet of iron pieces
 yah vishwa kii ek pramukh jalsandhi hai | Quibble is a word formed from the treaty of two words 'curve' and 'utterance'
 iskaa shabdic arth he- aisi ukti jo saamaanya se alag ho
 Tereda statement means that the word has power
 bhamah ne vakrokti ko ek alankaar mana tha
 His later Kuntaka developed curvature as a complete theory and incorporated all the parts of poetry into it
 isliye kuntak ko vakrokti sampradaay kaa pravartak acharya mana jaataa he
 Kuntaka is credited with the prestige and rendering of the Vibhokti theory, but its tradition is ancient
 bhamah ke purvavarti kaviyon baan, subandhu aadi main iske sandarbh praapt hote hai
 Bhamah has used curvature in a broader sense
 unhone vakrokti main shabd or arth, donon kaa antarbhaav mana he
 They have used quibble and exaggeration in the same sense
 atishyokti kaa arth he lokatikrant gocharata
 Vibhokti is considered as the original decking for the same reason
 iske bina vaakya kavy na rahakar vaarta maatr rah jaataa he
 Dandi has also given importance to Vakrokti as Bhamah
 dandi ne waniumay ke do bhed bataaye hai- swaabhaavokti tathaa vakrokti
 Dandi has accepted curvature and exaggeration at the root of all ornaments
 bhamah or dandi main keval yah antar he ki bhamah sbhavokti ko vakrokti kii paridhi main sweekaar karte hai or dandi use bhinn maanate hue vakr kathan se kam mahatvapurn samajhate hai
 Anandavardhana has not given an independent interpretation of quibble
 unhone ise vishisht alankaar maanakar iske saamaanya tathaa vyapak rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 Anandavardhana, while acknowledging the curvilinear significance of Bhamah, considered the exaggeration and quibble synonymous and accepted all the embellishments as exaggerated
 abhinavgupt ne vakrokti ke saamaanya rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 According to them, the curvature of words and meanings is their extraterrestrial position and the meaning of this extraterrestrial is excessive
 vakrokti siddhant ke pravartak kuntak ne apane granth vakrokti jivitam main vakrokti ko kavy kii aatma kaha he
 He has given proper place to all poetry - Varna miracle, word beauty, elegance of content, unpredictability, management imagination etc
 by adhering to all poetic principles under curvature
 kuntak ke anusaar vakrokti keval vaak-chaaturya athwa ukti chamatkaar nahin he, vah kavi vyapaar athwa kavi kaushal he
 According to Dr
 Nagendra "in modern terms, it can be called artism - the most important element of poetry is art
" iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kuntak ne apane siddhant main vishay-vastu kaa nishedh kiya he
 He has accepted the natural elegance of the poetic object
 kavi ko kavy vastu ke sahruday-romantic dharmon ko vyakt karnaa chahie
 This is possible only with the talent of the poet
 is prakaar unke anusaar antat kavi vyapaar hi pramukh he
 " bhartiya kavy siddhant main ras siddhant anubhuti athwa bhaavana par aadhaarit he or alankaar siddhant kavi kalpana par aadhaarit he
 The quibble theory is related to the decking principle in this respect
 vakrokti main alankaaron ke kalpana vaichitrya ko vyapak aadhaar par sweekaar kiya gaya he
 This imagination is unique, not congenial
 dhwani tathaa vakrokti kaa antar bhi yahi he ki dhwani kii kalpana sahrudayanishth he or vakrokti kii kalpana kavyanishth
 Therefore, the approach of sound is subjective and objective of curvature
 kuntak ne ras ko vakrokti kaa praan maanakar kalpana ke saath bhaavana ke mahatv ko bhi sweekaar kiya he
 Kuntaka has also considered angular curvature as a part of curvature
 vakrata ke bina ras kii sthiti sambhav nahin he jabaki ras ke bina vakrata kii apni swatantra sthiti he
 Kuntaka considers desperation curvature to be contemptible, not giving importance to such a situation
 kuntak kaa vakrokti siddhant vyapak or samanvayshil siddhant he
 At the core of its origin is sound theory with a tradition of ornamentation theory
 kuntak ke vakrokti siddhant main sampurna kavy ko sweekruti mili he
 Even if the force in his theory is on the art side, his explanation has the full support of the object side and the emotional side

 The doctrine of design is a theory presented by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida
 jinka janm algeria me hua tha
 Derrida's vast works have had the greatest impact on literary theory and continental philosophy
 unke nirmit kuch kritiyon ke naam he: spich and phenamina, of grammatology, riting and diference or dissemination 
 Derrida's theory of design is influenced by the works of many other philosophers
 unke niv in anek kritiyon main paae ja sakate he
 Inspired by Edmund Husserl's writing, Derrida blends phenomenological and communicative approaches
 freedorich nitshi, ek astitvvaadi, ke darshanik drushtikon, deconstruction ke agradoot bane
 Andre Lehua Guh has an important contribution in the formulation of decomposition and the idea scheme of deference
 fardinand di sausayor ke sanrachnavadik siddhanton kaa deconstruction or post-strekachralism ke vikaas main bada yogadan he
 Derrida began writing when the rift in the French intellectual landscape was reflected in the perspectives and structuralism perspectives
 ghatnatmak drushtikon use kehete hen jab ek anubhav ko uske janmotpatti dwaara samajha jaataa hen
 The structuralist view says that the study of the birth of any architecture can only reveal the fact, but the study of its structure gives an idea of the depth of its experience
 san 1959 me darida is vichaardhaara par prashn uthaate hue poochhate hen kii kya har ek sanrachana kii ek utpatti sthal nahin hoti or kya ek utpatti sthal kii maujuudagi hi ek sanrachana kii hone hi soochna nahin detii? is kathan dwaara darida kahana chaahate hen kii pratibhasik or sanrachanaatmak drushtikon donon hi kisi bhi vaastu yaa siddhanth ko puri tarah samajhane ke liye aavashyak hen
 He says that a structure cannot be understood until we know about its origin and do not understand that the place of origin itself is very complex and structural
 darida kehate hen kii yahi diachronism hamen texuality ke kareeb le jaati hen
 The principles of deconstruction today are considered a subdivision of post-structuralism
 is siddhanth kaa darida ne sausayor ke sanrachnawadi siddhanth se vyutpann kiya he
 According to Sausaur, words have no natural relation to their simulated objects
 vah kehete hen kii ek shabd sirf ek sanket chinh kii tarah kaam karata hen jo hame ek vaastu ke taraf ishaara karata he
 a symbol is made up of two parts - signified and signifier
 sausayor ke mutabik ek signyphoid or ek signiphair ke bich kaa rishta prakritik nahin maatr manamaana he
 Every word has been given a meaning before and this meaning has no relation to the actual form of that vastu
 halaaki kyonki har shabd se ek arth joda gaya hen un donon kaa rishta sthir man jaataa hen
 Derrida challenges this stable relationship by saying that since the meaning of a word can never be captured within that word and its meaning can be understood only when it is seen in the difference of the rest of the words, that is why the meaning of a word is related Can be understood in the form itself
 vah kehete hen kii ham laal rang ko sahi dhang se pahchaan paaten hen kyunki vah nile yaa hare rang se alag he
 We recognize this difference and hence know them as different colors
 darida ke mutabik har vaastu kaa ek dwichar vipareet hota hen, jaise ujaalaa or andheraa, safed or kaala, achchhai or bure ityadi
 Explaining this in more detail, he says that the full meaning of a word is never included in that word
 or chunki puraa arth nahin samaaya he ham yah kah sakate hen kii arth kii anupasthit he
 Thus, to deconstruct a binary opposite, it is necessary to recognize the importance of the marginal term, because on the basis of this term, the privileged term gets meaning
 ek dwichar arth us baat ki bhi nishaani he jo anupasthit he
 We consider a chair to be a chair because it is different from a table
 is anupasthithi ko darida difpherans kaa naam dete hen
 According to him, Difference is formed by the composition of Difference and Deferral
 ek chinh kaa arth hameshaa usase pare hota hen
 Therefore, a sign is not completely absorbed in itself, it always depends on another sign or Vastu, it points beyond itself
 isi vajah se darida kehate hen kii ek chinh kaa puraa matlab uske dwichar vipareet or uske arth ke taalane ke aadhaar par hi samajha ja saktaa he or arth maatr ek halake nishane kii tarah rah jaataa he
 Consequently, Derrida states that there is a need to find a transcendental signifier, that is, a sign or signifier that does not have to depend on another signifier for its meaning
 haalanki yah saafe zaahir he kii yah mumkin nahin ho saktaa
 The definition of Derrida deconstruction gives something like this - Deconstruction is a serious approach or strategy of reading and analysis that can be applied in literature, language science, philosophy, law and architecture
 yah bhashaa kaa ek siddhanth he, padhane kaa ek tarika he jo hardam koshish karata he kii ek kriti ke seemaa, hashia, jutana, niyat arth, sachai or pahchaan ko khandit karata he, nasht karata he or kisi bhi dharna ko palat detaa he
 Deconstruction questions all of those types of creations and shows that they are all based on the methods and systems that are created in a natural way and there is no absolute truth in them
 deconstruction khaarij karata he us jod karne kii pranali ko jo koshish karata he kii har arth ko usee kriti me samaa liya jaye
 Derrida mentions deconstruction for the first time in his work of Grammatology, which he wrote in 1967
 grammtologi kaa arth, darida ke mutabik he likhit bhashaa kaa vigyaanan
 In this work, Derrida says that when the language is understood as writing, then the condition of its meaning, we can call it as deconstruction
 kehane kaa matlab yah hua kii chaahe likhit hamaara hi ho magar un shabdon ko arth hamane nahin die hen, vah pehle se hi duniya me maujuud the
 For years, the meaning of those words has remained the same, which is why language is never available to us
 deconstruction astitv me he kyonki arth me anivaary rup se vyakhya, samjhauta vaarta or anuwaad kuch kuch maatr me uplabdh hoten he
 Further, Derrida also predicts a midpoint planned on its structure, but this midpoint remains both inside and outside the structure by contrast
 darida kehate hen kii yah madhyabindu ek kaalpanik soch he
 The midpoint controls the structure but does not follow its own built law
 udhaaharan ke rup me – bhagwaan is shrrishti ke racheta hen magar vah is duniya me nahin rahete, vah is duniya ke pare hen
 He also says that it is not possible to break free from the midpoint of a structure because it can always be changed for the other midpoint, like God who is in the middle of theology, we can replace them with the Father or the Spirit
 atah deconstruction hame dikhataa he kii malum hone vaale sthir sansthaaen hameshaa wesi nahin hotin jese hame dikhta hen
 Deconstruction makes the subdivision its point
 upasthithi ek ichha he sthir, nishchit or ekaatmak arth kii madhyabindu ke liye
 ise ham logocentrism (logo matlab unani me kaaran, soch yaa shabd kaha ja saktaa he
 When all this is considered to be the midpoint, it is called Logoscentrism
 deconstruction ke mutabiq kriti ke baahar kaa kuch bhi koi maaine nahin rakhata
 iskaa yah matlab nahin ke pathakon ko sirf shabdon par dhyaan dena chahie, balki uskaa yah matlab he kii ek kriti ke anubhav ke bahaar kuch bhi nahin
 kehane kaa matlab yah hua ke ek kriti uske sandarbh se alag nahin he
 History, politics, biography etc

 These cells, after a few more partitions, form a characteristic spherical structure, called a blastocyst, but cells isolated at this stage are not able to develop a complete organism
 atah inhen anshatah sakasham koshika kaha jaataa he
 The inner cells divide and differentiate several times to form specialized cells, which have the ability to regenerate each tissue
 inhen bahu-sakasham koshikaayen kehete hai
 These cells are preserved in each tissue, and are useful for cell reproduction and re-structure in tissues
 inke sthaan par aanshik sakasham koshikaayen bhi prayog kii ja saktin hai
 These have the advantage that they can be induced for any type of tissue differentiation, as they are derived from the embryo, so they are called embryonic stem cells

 Colored veils, engraved markings and printing can be used to help identify the tablet
 nirmaan prakriyaayein or takanic tablet ko vishesh gun pradaan kar sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, nirantar sravit hone yaa teji se ghulaa dene vaale sutrikaran
 Some drugs may be unsuitable for oral route use
 udhaaharan ke liye, insulin jaisi protein aushadhiyaan pet ke amlon dwaara vikrut ho sakati hai
 Tablets of such drugs cannot be prepared
 kuch aushadhiyaan yakrut ke dwaara niskriy kii ja sakati hai jab unhen vahaan jathrantra path se yakrut portal shira dwaara le jaaya jaataa he jo unhen maukhik upyog ke liye anupyukt bana detii hai
 Drugs that can be taken under the tongue are absorbed by the mucous membrane of the mouth so that they can escape through the liver and are less susceptible to the first crisis path effect
 kuch aushadhiyon kii maukhik jaev uplabdhta jathrantra path se hone vaale nune avasorana ke kaaran nimna ho sakati he
 Such drugs need to be given in very high doses or by injection
 jaldi asar karne vaali yaa gambhir dushprinaam vaali aushadhiyon ke liye maukhik maarg upyukt nahin hota he
 For example, salbutamol, which is used for the treatment of pulmonary system problems, can have an effect on the heart and circulatory system if used orally; These effects can be reduced drastically by inhaling small doses in the space required for action
 tablet vastav main kisi bhi aakaar main banaai ja sakati he, haalanki marijon or tablet banane vaali mashiinon kii aavashyaktaaon kaa taatpary he ki adhikansh gol, andakaar yaa capsule ke aakaar kii hon

 The diameter and size of the tablets are determined by the machine tooling used for their production - a die and an upper and lower punch are required
 ise touling centre kaha jaataa he
 Thickness is determined by the amount of substance of the tablet during compression and the position of the pore in relation to each other
 ek baar ise karne par, ham sampeedan ke dauraan lagaae gaye sangat dawaab kii maap kar sakate hai
 The shorter the distance between the pores and the thickness, the greater the force exerted during compression and sometimes the tablet is more rigid
 tablet ko itnaa adhik majboot hona chahie kii ve bottle ke bheetar nahin toote, saath hi ve itani bhurabhuri bhi hon ki jathari nalee main aasaani se tut jaaen
 Tablets should be strong enough to withstand the stresses of packaging, loading and handling by pharmacists and patients
 The mechanical strength of the tablet is evaluated using a combination of simple failure and erosion tests and more sophisticated engineering tests
 aksar adhik saamaanya pareekshanon kaa upyog gunvattta niyantran ke prayojanon ke liye kiya jaataa he, jabaki adhik jatil pareekshanon kaa upyog anusandhan or vikaas charan main sutrikaran or vinirmaan prakriya kaa dizin taiyaar karne ke dauraan kiya jaataa he
 The parameters of the tablet's properties are published in various international pharmacology
 snehak avyavon ko ek saath gucchhon ke rup main badalane or tablet ke chhidron yaa capsule bharne kii mashin main chipakane se rokte hai
 Lubricants also ensure that the tablet is manufactured and protruded with low friction between the solid and the dye wall
 khadiya yaa silica jaise aam khanij or vasa, magnesium stiaret yaa stiarik amla, tablet yaa kathor gelatin capsule main sarvaadhik istemaal kiye jane vaale snehak hai
 In the process of compressing the tablet, the main guideline is to ensure that the appropriate amount of active ingredient remains in each tablet
 Therefore, all the ingredients should be mixed well
 If a mixture of sufficiently homogenous components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes, then the ingredients must be granulated before compression to ensure uniform distribution of the active compound in the final tablet
 Two basic techniques are used to convert the powder into granular form for compression in tablet form: humidification and dry condensation
 Powders that can be mixed well do not need to be granulated and can be compressed into tablets by passive compression
 adra kaneekaran powder mishran ko halke se pind rup main badalane ke liye ek drav bandhak kaa upyog karne kii ek prakriya he
 The amount of fluid must be controlled appropriately, as excessive wetting will make the particles much harder and less wetting will make them extremely soft and brittle
 Aqueous solutions have the advantage that they are safer to use than solvent-based systems but may not be suitable for drugs that are degraded by aqueous analysis
 nimna aparupan vaali adra kaneekaran prakriyaayein bahut saamaanya mishrak upkaran kaa upyog karti hai or samaan rup se mishrit avasthaa ko praapt karne ke liye kaaphi samay le sakati hai
 Shear humidification processes with shear use use a device that mixes powders and liquids at a very rapid rate, thus speeding up the manufacturing process

 It is used because of allowing close control of the annotation process
 shushk kaneekaran prakriyaayein nimna daab ke adheen powder mishran ke prakaash sanghanan ke dwaara daanon kaa nirmaan karti hai
 The solids formed in this way break down slowly and form granules
 is prakriya kaa aksar us samay prayog kiya jaataa he jab dane ke rup main badale jane vaale utpaada nami or garmi ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 Dry condensation can be done in a tablet press or a roll press called a roller compactor
 shushk kaneekaran upkaran uchit ghanatv vruddhi praapt karne evam daanon ke nirmaan ke liye vibhinn kism ke daab pradaan karata he
 Dry decolorization is more common than humidification, so the cost is reduced
 haalanki, shushk kaneekaran aksar baarik daanon kaa ucchtar pratishat utpann karata he jo gunvattta se samjhauta kar sakate hai yaa tablet ke liye pratifal kii samasyaayein utpann kar sakate hai
 Dry condensation requires drugs or additives with sensitizing properties and may require a 'dry bond' to be added to the formulation to facilitate the formation of grains
 daanedaar banane ke baad, tablet banane kii prakriya ke dauraan tablet ke mishran ko upkaran main chipakane se bachaane ke liye ek antim snehan kadam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 It usually involves a low shear mixture of grains with powdered lubricants such as magnesium stearate or stearic acid
 tablet nirmaan sambandhi mishran taiyaar karne ke liye chaahe jis prakriya kaa bhi upyog kiya jaae, powder sanghanan dwaara ek tablet banane kii prakriya usase kaaphi milti-julati rahati he
 First, the powder is filled with dye over the top
 powder kaa dravyaman daai main nimna chhidr kii sthiti, daai ke anuprastha kaat kshetra or powder ke ghanatv se nirdhaarit hota he
 At this stage, the weight of the tablet is normally adjusted by moving the lower aperture
 daai ko bharne ke baad, upree chhidr ko daai main neeche kiya jaataa he evam powder ko 5 or 20% ke sarandhrata ke bich ekakshiya rup se sampeedit kiya jaataa he
 Compression can occur in one or two stages and commercial production is very rapid
 ant main, upree chhidr ko daai ke upar or baahar khinchaa jaataa he evam tablet ko daai se nimna chhidr ko uthaakar us samay tak baahar rakhaa jaataa he jab tak ki isaki upree sataha daai ke upree agrabhag se prakshalit na ho jaae
 yah prakriya kai baar sirf vividh tablet kaa nirmaan karne ke liye dohraayi jaati he
 Common problems encountered during tablet manufacturing include: tablet ke sutrikarnon ke dizin evam pareekshan ko tablet sanghanan anukaarak yaa powder sanghanan anukaarak naamak ek prayogshaala mashin kaa upyog kar ke kiya jaataa he
 It is a computer controlled device that can measure the pore conditions, orifice pressures, friction forces, dye wall pressures and sometimes the internal temperature of the tablet during condensation phenomena
 sutrikaran kaa anukulan karne ke liye vibhinn mishranon ke chote parimaanon vaale kai prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Mathematically modified hole speeds can be programmed to fit any type and model of tablet production

 The tablet press, also known as a tablet making machine, is suitable for small, convenient use at a time in a tablet-making laboratory, ranging from inexpensive models with only half a ton of pressure to huge, computerized, There are a variety of industrial models that can produce thousands to millions of tablets per hour with high pressure
 tablet press kisi bhi aushadh evam poshan padaarth nirmaataa ke liye ek aavashyak yantra hota he
 Common manufacturers of the tablet include Fett, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty and Curtoy
 The tablet press should enable the operator to adjust the position of the lower and upper pores accurately so that each of the tablet's weight, thickness and density can be controlled
 This can be achieved by using various cams, rollers and / or straps that function in tablet devices
 daai ko bharne or sampeedan ke baad tablet ko press se baahar nikaalane or hataane ke liye yantric pranaaliyon ko bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Pharmaceutical tablet presses should be easily cleaned and reconfigured with various tools quickly as they are commonly used to manufacture various products
 aajkal kai tablet ko press karne ke baad unki coating kii jaati he
 Although sugar coating was previously popular, the process has several drawbacks
 aadhunik tablet kii coating bahulak or poliseccaride aadhaarit hoti he, jiske saath plasticizer evam varnak shaamil hote hai
 The coating of the tablet should be permanent and strong enough to hold the tablet in place, the tablet should not be allowed to stick together during the coating process and the characters or insignia embossed above the tablet should adopt fine contour lines
 
 Coating is necessary for tablets that have a tasteless taste and a more smooth texture, making larger tablets easier to swallow
 tablet kii coating un ghatakon kii shelf aayu kaa vistaar karne main bhi upyogi hote hai jo nami yaa oxikaran ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 Opaque substances such as titanium dioxide can protect light-sensitive functional substances from photosynthesis
 vishesh coating brands kii pahchaan main vruddhi kar sakate hai
 If the active ingredient of a tablet is sensitive to acid or is inflammatory to the stomach lining, a intestinal coating may be used that is resistant to stomach acid and dissolves in the less acidic region of the intestines
 
 antric coating kaa prayog un aushadhiyon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he jinhen choti aant, jahaan ve avashoshit hote hai, tak pahunchane main lage lambey samay ke dwaara pratikul rup se prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 Often the coating is chosen to control the rate of dissolution of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract
 pachan tantra main kuch aushadhiyon ko vibhinn sthanon par behatar bhang se avashoshit kiya jaataa he
 If the maximum absorption of a drug is in the stomach, then the coating that dissolves quickly and easily in acid will be selected
 If the rate of absorption is best in the large intestine or colon, an acid-resistant and slowly dissolving coating is used to ensure that it reaches the correct location before dissolving
 aam taur par kisi khaas aushadhi ke liye sarvshereshth avasorana vaala jathrantriy path naidanik pareekshanon se nirdhaarit hota he
 Sometimes it is necessary to divide the tablet in half or quarter
 ankit kiye jane par tablet ko sahi-sahi todna adhik aasaan hota he, lekin goli vibhaajak naamak kuch upkaran sabhi prakaar kii tablet ko todane main sakasham hote hai
 The tablet with special coating should not be broken before use, as it will eliminate its delayed effect by exposing the tablet to the digestive juices

 There is a rich literature of scripted stories in the Sanskrit language, which has been preaching entertainment for hundreds of years
 kathasahitya se sambhddha granthon ke aalochan se spasht ho jaataa he ki sanskrit sahitya main teenon prakaar kii kahaniyon ke udhaaharan milte hai jo vartmaan samay main pashchimi deshon main fairi tels, fabulls tathaa diadectic tels kahi jaatin hai
 Pursuit of Vedic codes is necessary to discover the original source of the stories
 rugveda kii mantrasamhita main anek rochak kahaniyon kii soochna milti he jinka paribrihan shaunak ne "brihaddevataa" main, shadgurushishy ne "katyayan sarvanukramani" kii vedarthdipika main, yask ne nirukt main, sayan ne apane vedbhaashyon main tathaa syadvived ne "niti manjari" main kiya he
 It is from here that these stories, through the Puranas, incarnated in secular Sanskrit literature for the entertainment and teaching of the public
 kathasahitya ke pradhan granthon kaa sankshipt parichay neeche diya jaataa he : Main article Panchatantra sanskrit kii kahaniyon kaa yahi sarvshereshth tathaa pracheen sangrah he

 dakshin main mahilaropya naamak nagar main amarkirti raja ke murkh putron ko niti tathaa vyavhaar kii shiksha dene ke liye vishnu shrma ne is granthratna kaa pranayan kiya
 Many versions of this have been held in different centuries and in different provinces of India, which Sangopang studied after the famous German Sanskritist Dr
 Hertel has given four categories of its development
 panchatantr kaa sabase pracheen rup "tantrakhyayika" main surakshit he jiskaa mul sthaan kashmir he
 Various four versions of Panchatantra are available today - "tantrakhyayika" yaa "tantrakhyaan" main kathaon kii ruparekha bahut hi parimit he
 The compilation of the policy verses is very brief and justified
 pahalavi anuwaad kaa yahi mul rup he jisaki rachana chaturth shatee main kii gai thi
 The Panchatantra available today is the result of the transformation and addition of a Jain scholar named Purnabhadra
 inhone 1255 vikrami main mul granth kaa amul sanshodhan kiya tathaa niti ke padyon kaa samavesh kar ise bharaa puraa banaaya
 a collection of ancient stories from the Panchatantra is available in "buddhist Jatakas" which are 550 in number and contain stories of ancient births of Lord Buddha and which are basically in Pali language
 in kahaniyon kaa rupagat vaishishtay yah he ki ek badi kahani ke bheetar choti kahaniyaan ek ke bheetar ek usee rup main goonthi gai hai jis prakaar china desh ke baks main bade baks ke bheetar chote baks ek ke bheetar ek banaae jate hai
 There are only five main stories in the five episodes of Panchatantra, within which the stories in the interior are arranged according to the context

 Learning or learning is an extensive and continuous lifelong process
 manushya janm ke uparaant hi siikhnaa prarambh kar detaa he or jivan bhar kuch na kuch sikhta rahata he
 Gradually, he tries to adjust himself to the environment
 is samaayojan ke dauraan vah apane anubhavon se adhik laabh uthaane kaa prayaas karata he
 This process is called learning in psychology
 jis vyakti main seekhney kii jitani adhik shakti hoti he, utana hi uske jivan kaa vikaas hota he
 In the process of learning, a person performs many actions and activities
 atah siikhnaa kisi sthiti ke prati sakriy pratikriya he
 For example - when carrying a lit lamp in front of a small child, he tries to catch the flame of the lamp
 is prayaas main uskaa haath jalane lagata he
 He pulls the arm back
 punah jab kabhi uske saamne deepak laayaa jaataa he to vah apane purv anubhav ke aadhaar par lau pakadaney ke liye, haath nahin badhaata he, varan usase dur ho jaataa he
 This idea is called reacting to the situation
 duusare shabdon main kah sakate hai ki anubhav ke aadhaar par balak ke swaabhaavik vyavhaar main parivartan ho jaataa he
 It is clear from the above definitions that a person's behavior changes due to learning, this change in behavior can be both external and internal
 atah siikhnaa ek prakriya he jisamen anubhav evam prashikshan dwaara vyavhaar main sthaayee yaa asthai parivartan dikhaai detaa he
 EL Tharndike is a famous American psychologist who discovered some rules of learning which are divided into the following two parts - seekhney ke mukhya niyam teen he jo is prakaar hai - 1
 Rule of readiness - According to this rule, when a person is ready beforehand to do a work, that work makes him happy and learns soon
 iske vipareet jab vyakti kaary ko karne ke liye taiyaar nahin rahata yaa seekhney kii ichha nahin hoti haito vah jhunjhala jaataa he yaa krodhit hota he va seekhney kii gati dhimi hoti he
 2
 Rule of practice - According to this rule, a person learns the action that he performs again and again and he forgets the action which he leaves or does not do for a long time
 jaise‘- ganit ke prashn hal karnaa, tip karnaa, cycle chalaanaa aadi
 It is also called the rule of usage and non-usage
 3
 prabhaav kaa niyam - is niyam ke anusaar jivan main jis kaary ko karne par vyakti par acha prabhaav padataa he yaa sukh kaa yaa santosh miltaa he unhen vah seekhney kaa praytn karata he evam jin kaaryon ko karne par vyakti par bura prabhaav pasta he unhen vah karnaa chhod detaa he
 This rule is also called the law of happiness and sorrow or reward and punishment
 1
 bahu anukriya niyam - is niyam ke anusaar vyakti ke saamne kisi nai samasya ke aane par use sulajhane ke liye vah vibhinn pratikriyaaon ke hal dhughane kaa praytn karata he
 He keeps on reacting till he finds the right solution to the problem and his problem is solved
 isse use santosh miltaa he tharnadike kaa praytn evam bhul dwaara seekhney kaa siddhanth isi niyam par aadhaarit he
 2
 Rule of mental state or attitude - According to this rule, when a person is mentally ready to learn, he learns soon
 iske vipareet yadi vyakti maansik rup se kisi kaary ko seekhney ke liye taiyaar nahin rahata to us kaary ko vah sikh nahin sakegaa
 3
 Rule of partial action - According to this rule, a person performs many actions to solve a problem on the basis of effort and mistake
 vah apni anrtadrushti kaa upyog kar aanshik kriyaaon kii sahaayta se samasya kaa hal dhudh letaa he
 4
 The rule of equality - According to this rule, when a problem is presented, before the person experiences similarity in the previous experience or circumstances, his experiences automatically transfer and help him in learning
 5
 saahchary parivartan kaa niyam - is niyam ke anusaar vyakti praapt gyaan kaa upyog anya paristhiti main yaa sahachaari uddipak vastu ke prati bhi karne lagata he
 As saliva starts dripping after seeing the food material from the mouth of the dog
 parantu kuch samay ke baad bhojan ke bartanako hi dekh kar laar tapakane lagati he
 Learning helps to adapt to the surroundings
 kisi vishisht saamaajik-saanskrithik parivesh main kuch samay rahane ke pashchaat ham us samaaj ke niyamon ko samaj jate hai or yahi hamase apekshit bhi hota he
 We become citizens and members responsible for family, society and our functions
 yah sab seekhney ke kaaran hi sambhav he
 We use learning to acquire different types of skills
 parantu sabase jatil prashn yah he ki ham sikhte kaise hai ? Psychologists have tried to explain the process of learning through a variety of studies on humans and animals
 unhon ne kuch vidhiyaan in git kii hai jinka upyog saral evam jatil anukriyaaon ko arjeet karne main ho ta he
 There are two basic types of learning - classical contracting and mechanical or active contracting
 iske atirikt vaachik yaa shabdic siikhnaa, prekshan siikhnaa, kaushal siikhnaa, or pratyay siikhnaa aadi anya prakaar bhi hai
 Classical contracting is also called Powlav's theory because it was invented by Ivan P
 Powlav, a Russian scientist who was interested in studying the relationship between stimulation and response
 unhone kutton par adhyayan kiye
 a dog was tied up and the laboratory assistant presented food to the dog
 powelav ne paaya ki kute ne laar sravit karne kii anukriya ko sikh liya tha
 He studied this method of contracting in detail 
 powelav ne kute par krambaddh prayaas kiye jisamen dhwani or bhojan ko saath main sanlagn kiya gaya
 Sound and food were combined together in this effort to learn
 dhwani prastut karne kaa samay kaaphi kam tha or dhwani or bhojan prastut karne ke madhya main kareeb 2 se 3 minute kaa antar ho ta tha
 In the first few attempts, the dog used to secrete saliva when food was presented
 khaanaa dekhte hi laar sravit hona ek swaabhaavik pratikriya he isiilie laar ko ananubandhit anukriya kaha gaya
 In later attempts, the bell was first played and then the food was presented
 ghanti or bhojan ke ek saath kuch prayogon ke baad kute ne akele ghanti ke bajte hi laar sravit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The sound was called the contracted stimulus because the dog contracted with the sound and started to secrete saliva as soon as the bell rang
 ghanti ke bajte hi laar kaa sravit ho janaa anubandhit anukriya kahalaai
 It has been found that if the bell is rung in every attempt, but the food is not presented, then the contract gets erased
 arthath ghanti ke bajane se koi bhi laar sravit nahin hogi or yadi kai prayaason main lagaatar aisa hi kiya jaataa he to vilopan kii sthiti aa jaati he
 It has also been found that if after some interval of willow punctuation, if the bell is rung without food, the dog will again drool for a few attempts
 vilop ke baad anubandhit anukriya kii is sthiti ko swatah parivartit kehete hai
 If a child does his homework on time, his parents praise him and the child learns to do that work
 le kin agar baccha koi plate tod de ta he to use danta jaataa he yaa use sajaa di jaati he or balak is tarah ke vyavhaar ko dubaara na karnaa sikh jaataa he
 This type of contract is called casual contract or active contract
 duusare shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki ham vah vyavhaar karnaa sikh jate hai jisamen parinaam sakaaratmak ho te hai or ham vah vyavhaar karnaa chhod dete hai jo hamen nakaaratmak parinaam de ta he
 Practical contracting is a method of learning in which animals repeat behavior that results in a positive and avoid behavior that results in a negative

 skinner i se sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee vaigyanik hai jo seekhney main kriyaprasut anubandhan kii bhoomika ke sabase zyada pakshdhar rahe hai
 He built the box called the Skinner Box to use this contract on mice
 is dabbe kii saamne kii diwaar main ek liver laga hua tha
 Pressing the lever was the response the rat had to learn
 ek bhukhe chuuhe ko is dabbe ke andar rakhaa gaya, or usne andar jate hi vibhinn prakaar kii kriyaayen kerani shuru kar deen
 After some time, he suddenly pressed the lever from which the food in the plate placed in front of him fell
 or chuuhe ne vah khaanaa kha liya
 After eating food, the rat started performing activities again in the cage
 kuch gatividhi ke baad usase vah liver dubaara dab gaya or punah uske saamne bhojan kaa tukdaa gir gaya
 shana-shana-rat stopped all irregular activities and started doing specific activities only around the lever
 ant main chuha yah sikh jaataa he ki liver ko dabaane par uske saamne bhojan giraaya jaataa he jo ki uske liye santushti pradaan karne vaala parinaam tha
 In other words, the rat pressing the liver becomes the feeding agent
 chuuhe dwaara kii gayi anukriya punarbalit thi jisase chuuhe ne is vyavhaar ko uparjit kar liya yaa sikh liya
 In obtaining food, the lever played a role for the rat, giving satisfaction to the rat, and thus learning is also called mechanical contraction
 ise kriyaprasut anubandhan bhi kaha jaataa he kyon ki chuuhe yaa kisi praani dwaara kiya gaya vyavhaar vaataavaran par kii gai kriya he
 We can explain most of the behavior learned by human beings with the help of active contract
 udaahranarth mata-pita or duusare adhikari balak ke har aakraamak vyavhaar ko dandit or achche vyavhaar ko puraskrit karte hai
 Reinforcement plays a pivotal role in active contracting
 yah nakaaratmak yaa sakaaratmak ho saktaa he
 Let us try to understand both types of reinforcement
 aisi koi kriya jo anukriya kii sankhya main vruddhi karti he punarbalan kehalaati he
 We saw in Skinner's experiment that the rat responds to repeated liver pressures and receives food
 ise sakaaratmak punarbalan kehete hai
 Thus a positive reinforcement or reward is a tendency that reinforces the effect of that specific behavior
 sakaaratmak punarbalan vah koi bhi uddipan he jiske madhyam se us vishisht anukriya ko aage jane kaa bal miltaa he
 
 ‘nakaaratmak’ shabd punarbalan kii prakruti ko bataata he 
 This is reinforcing because it increases the number of responses
 is vidhi ko ‘palaayan’ adhigam kaha gaya kyonki chuha agar liver ko dabaata he to aghat se batch saktaa he
 The contract that occurs as a result of a second type of negative reinforcement is called learning by rescue, in which the rat can avoid trauma by pressing the lever
 palaayan yaa bachaav dwaara seekhney main nakaaratmak punarbalan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or praani palaayan yaa bachaav dwaara isse batch jaataa he
 How can we reinforce the correct responses? This can occur by the use of continuous or partial reinforcement
 nirantar punarbalan main pratye k uchit anukriya ko punarbalit kiya jaataa he
 For example, the number of times a mouse presses the lever, the same amount of food is presented in the plate
 vaikalpik taur par anukriyaaon ko kabhi aanshik yaa kabhi rukaawat ke saath punarbalit kiya jaataa he
 Constant reinforcement helps in establishing or strengthening new behaviors
 duusari taraf aanshik punarbalan siikhe huye vyavhaar ko banaaye rakhane main adhik shaktishaalee he
 Learning by observation is the third main method by which we can learn
 dusron ke vyavhaar ko dekhakar unke kaushalon ko apana lenaa bahut hi saamaanya baat he
 It is a part of day to day life
 prekshan dwaara siikhnaa kisi vishisht vaataavaran main upyukt adarsh ke vidyaman rahane par nirbhar karata he
 When a child sees a person whom he considers to be his role model, then he incorporates that behavior in himself
 udhaaharan ke liye navayuvak dusron ke aakraamak vyavhaar ko dekhakar fouran hi vah vyavhaar sikh jate hai
 When Children T
V
 When they see an incident of violence, they also try to learn that behavior
 yadhyapi prekshan vidhi anukaran vidhi se kahin zyada jatil vidhi he
 Children learn information and different skills through this method but are unable to use it
 manushya, vishesh taur par yuvak zyaadaatar sakaaratmak vidhi se prabhavit kiye ja sakate hai agar unke adarsh upyukt hon
 You are trying to understand the concept of learning by reading this lesson, it is possible by learning only
 aapane bhashaa sikhi hui he
 People learn different languages in different parts of the world
 bhashaa ko seekhney kii prakriya ko shabdic yaa vaachik siikhnaa kaha jaataa he
 When you remember your childhood, you find that you started learning languages by recognizing letters
 phir shabd siikhe or uske baad vaakya
 When you learn foreign language, you use couple words

 Learning theories is in relation to developing categories of events and objects
 yah hamaare jivan ke liye bahut mahatvapu rn he ki ham vastuon ke madhya kisi kasuti ke aadhaar par antar karen
 For example, boys, girls, fruits and furniture fall under the category
 sanpratyay ke antargat ek saath bahut si vastuen aatin hai
 The use of different types of categories or names of classes helps us in communicating and carrying out various activities
 sanpratyay prakritik athwa kritrim ho sakate hai
 They can be tangible or intangible
 swatantraaa, prem or loktantr amoort sanpratyay ke udhaaharan hai
 Cow, table, boy, girl, orange and rose are examples of tangible principles
 kisi vichaar ko sikhte samay ham sabhi prakaar kii uttejna ke liye ek hi tarah kii anukriya karte hai
 While learning a theory, we do the same response for different stimuli of a particular category
 is prakaar ham sabhi prakaar kii mejon ke liye maatr mej shabd athwa sab prakaar ke baalkon ke liye maatr balak shabd kaa prayog karte hai
 Virtually all types of higher-order learning necessarily involve theory learning
 sanpratyay vishwa kii jatiltaaon ko kam karne main madad karte hai
 An important area of learning involves the acquisition of a variety of skills such as cycling, writing, driving a car, driving an airplane, leading a group, encouraging others and so on
 in sabhi kaaryo ke liye hamen kaushal kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Those people who are capable of learning such skills get various opportunities in life
 ek baar in kaushalon kaa uparjan ho jaye to vah usamen or adhik vruddhi kar sakate hai
 Once these skills are learned, they become automatic and the person can do them comfortably and conveniently
 parinamswaroop log kaary ko swechhanusaar karte hai or ek hi samay main ek se zyada kaary kar sakate hai
 It is an interesting fact that learning of a single task is not limited to that specific task
 siikhe huye kaary kaa prayog du sari paristhitiyon main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The ability to use a person's knowledge, skills and learning of any kind is greatly appreciated
 agar ek balak guna yaa bhaag sikhta he to vah iskaa upyog na sirf kaksha main karata he balki aavashyaktaa padane par bazaar or ghar main bhi karata he
 The transfer of training indicates the process in which he uses previously learned behavior in a new situation
