 The film was awarded in six categories at the Filmfare Awards in addition to the Best Film at the National Film Awards

 Now the film goes back to the past when Bhaskar Banerjee, a militant doctor, is taking care of patients in a Mumbai slum and sees that the hunger and the plight has spread to the extent that he is incapable of doing anything for anyone
 vahiin uske dost dow prakaash kulkarni kaa jamaa jamaaya aspataal he jo bin biimaar marizon ko bhi dekh letaa he or unase acchhee raqam anthta he jabaki garib mariz, jo ki bhaskar bhejtaa hi rahata he, ke vah bina paise hi saare test karvaa detaa he
 One day Prakash comes to know of the threat of one of his gynecologist friend Dr
 Trivedi from Delhi that he is sending his friend Anand to him
 prakaash anand se kuch saal pehle mila tha or uskaa acha dost ban gaya tha
 Anand has intestinal cancer and he knows that at most he will live for six months
 jab prakaash or bhaskar, prakaash ke daphtar main baithe huye hote hai to anand vahaan aa dhamkata he or apni mazaaq kii aadat shuru kar detaa he jisase bhaskar bannerjee ko gussa aa jaataa he or vah anand se poochta he ki use maaloom bhi he ki use kya beemaari he, to anand use bataata he ki use cancer he or vah zyaada se zyaada vah chah maheene hi zindaa rahegaa
 Hearing this, Bhaskar becomes convinced of the joy that despite knowing that he is the pride of a few days, the joy is so lively
 anand ab bhaskar ke ghar rahane lagata he or kisi tarah yah pataa laga letaa he ki bhaskar ek ladki renu se prem karata he lekin is prem ko zaahir karne kii usamen himmat nahin he
 Anand meets Renu's mother with the help of a wrestler and confirms Bhaskar and Renu's relationship but informs Renu's mother that he will not stay in Bhaskar and Renu's wedding

 In fixed mechanics, Euler's rotational equations describe the rotational motion of fast objects with the help of the rotational instruction system
 isamen jo ghurni frem liya jaataa he uskaa aksh us pind se judaa hua tathaa pind ke mukhya jadtv akshon ke samaantar hota he
 Euler equations are simple quasi-linear first-order equations in vector
 islar samikarnon kaa saamaanya rup nimnlikhit he- Where m is the thrust applied, i is the inertial matrix, ω is the angular velocity relative to the principal axes
 3D mukhya lambkonik akshon main uparokt samikarnon kaa nimnlikhit rup ho jaataa he- Where Mk is the component of the charged force M, Ik is the component of principal inertial moment axis i and ωk is the direction of the principal axes
 islar ke dwitiya niyam se armbh karne par, ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra main, koniya samveg l kaa samay ke saapeksh avkalan aropit balaghurna ke baraabar hota he Where iin is the inertial computation calculated in the inertial direction system
 yadhyapi yah niyam saarvbhaumik satya he, yah samaanya ghurni drudh pind kii gati ke liye hal karne main hameshaa sahaayak nahin he
 Since both Iin and ω can change during movement
 atah ham nirdesh tantra ko is tarah parivartit karte hai ki vah ghurni pind ke saath sthir rahe or is tarah se chayan karte hai ki isaki aksh jadtwaghurna pradeesh kii disha main sthit hon
 In this reference system, at least the inertial display is fixed, which facilitates calculation
 jaisaa kii jadtwaghurna main samajhaayaa gaya he, koniya samveg Where Mk, Ik and ωk are as described above
 ghurni nirdesh tantra main, samay avkalaj ko Should be replaced with jahaan adholikhit "rot" ghurni nirdesh tantra ko nirupit kar rahaa he
 In the inertial and rotational reference systems, the expression related to the problem is: jahaan q ghurni pradeesh he, jo kisi koniya veg sadish v se sambandhit lamb koniya pradeesh he In the front diagram, a billiard ball with r radius, m mass and i inertia is hit parallel to the table in such a way that the ball moves forward without sliding on the table
 ham isamen yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki gend ke aadhaar se kis oonchaai par bal f lagaaya jaay taaki koi gharshan bal na hone ke vaavjood gend bina phisale, ludhakte hue aage bad jaay
 The force m = - f of the force exerted in the horizontal direction produces rotational acceleration in the ball - yahan balaghurna rinatmak liya gaya he kyonki yah ghurnan kone φ ke vipareet he 
 In addition to this equation, the force f applied to the ball causes an acceleration in its center of mass
 atah Note that the acceleration x ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} is parallel to the table and in the direction of the force
 bina-sarake ludhakne ke liye aavashyak he ki- Thus all the above equations describe the motion of the ball in three variables h, φ, and x
 in samikarnon ko milakar hal karte hue hamen nimnlikhit jaankaree milti he- The inertia of a solid, homogeneous sphere is i = 2 5 mr 2 { \ displaystyle i = { \ tfrac {2} {5}} mr ^ {2}}
 yah maan rakhane par- r a wheel with radius, m mass and i inertia is rotating at a constant inclination at an angle α with the speed of gravitational acceleration g
 
 As this wheel is also shifting, linear acceleration of its mass is also taking place
 is samasya main ham yah maan rahe hai ki pahiye kii gati bina sarake ho rahi he
 Hence a frictional force r is produced between the plane and the wheel which rotates the wheel, because this force causes a fouling m = -r R
 yah balaghurna rinatmak liya gaya he kyonki yah ghurnan kone φ ke vipareet he
 Hence the following is the equation of the rotational speed of the wheel
 ab pahiye ke dravyaman kendra ke visthaapan par vichaar karte hai
 The value of element f in the direction of the plane of mass of the wheel, mg is f = mgsin
 yah bal gharshan bal ke ulti disha main kaary kar rahaa he
 So according to Newton's second law of motion - jahaan x ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} pahiye kaa nat-samtal ke samaantar twaran he
 Also, if the rolling motion is unfixed then x ̈ = - r φ ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}} = - r { \ ddot { \ varphi}}}
 is prakaar hamane teen agyaat raashiyon R, φ tathaa x ko samete hue gati ke sameekaran praapt kar liye
 On solving these equations, we get isse yah dekha ja saktaa he ki kisi diye hue nat-kone α ke liye, adhiktam twaran tab hota he jab pahiye kaa dravyaman adhik-se-adhik uske aksh ke nikat ho
 
 dhyaan dijiye ki isi nat-samtal par, yadi gharshan shunya ho to, us par sarak rahe kisi pind kaa twaran x ̈ = g sin ⁡ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}=g \ sin} hoga, jo pahiye ke twaran se adhik he
 The reason for this is that the potential energy of the wheel is turning into two types of kinetic energy - the kinetic energy of rotation and the kinetic energy of transfer of center of mass; Whereas the moving body has only one kinetic energy - the kinetic energy of the center of mass transfer musgal, devlathal tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke pithoragarh jile kaa ek gaanv he

 koi nayi rangath dete to main bhi irshaad kahata
 "ashfaq did not like this thing of Bismil; he said in a challenging tone -" Ram bhai! Now you fall into it, i will admit that your thinking is of a higher status than the liver and Mirza Ghalib
 " usee vakt pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne ye sher kaha- On hearing this, Ashfaq jumped up and hugged Bismil and said, "ram brother! i agree; you are masters of maestro too
" " In short, this is the real history of the background of the creation of Tamanna of Sarfaroshi

 kaha jaataa he ki phukuda hachinosuke ne judo main mukt abhyaas par kaano ke gurucharan ke beej bokar aupchaarik abhyaas kii takanic par jor diya tha
 More than a year after Kano joined Fukuda's school, Fukuda fell ill and died
 uske baad kaano ek anya tengin shin'yo-riyu skool ke chaatr ban gaye jo iso masatomo kaa tha jo phukuda kii tulana main purv-vyavasthit tareekon ke abhyaas par zyada jor dete the
 On the strength of his dedication, Kano quickly acquired the title of accomplished instructor and at the age of 21 became Iso's assistant instructor
 durbhaagya se, iso jald biimaar pad gaye or kaano ne yah mahasoos karte hue kito-riyu ke aikubo sunetoshi ke chaatr banakar ek duusari style ko apana liya ki unhen abhi bahut kuch siikhnaa he
 Like Fukuda, Ikubo placed much emphasis on free practice
 duusari taraf, kito-riyu main tengin shin'yo-riyu kii tulana main kaaphi had tak patakane kii takneekon par jor diya jaataa tha
 By this time, Kano was devising new techniques, such as "shoulder wheel" and "floating hip" bets
 However, he was already considering doing more than just expanding the principles of kito-ryu and Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu
 nae vichaaron se bhare kaano ke dimag main jujutsu ke ek pramukh sudhaar kii yojana thi jisaki takneekein kaaphi achche vaigyanik siddhanton par aadhaarit thi or jiskaa mukhya uddeshy marshall art kii bahaduree ke vikaas ke alaava yuvaaon ke sharir, dimag or charitra kaa bhi vikaas karnaa tha
 In May 1882, at the age of 22, at the end of his undergraduate degree at the university, Kano began training jujutsu to nine students of Ikubo's school in a Buddhist temple called Aisho-ji in Kamakura, and Ikubo He used to come there three days a week to help in training
 haalanki us mandir ko "kodocan" yaa "tarika sikhaane kii jagah" ke naam se pukaare jane se pehle do saal biit chuke the or kaano ko us vaqt tak kito-riyu ke "master" yaa guru kaa khitaab nahin diya gaya tha, lekin ise ab kodocan kii sansthapana mana jaataa he
 Judo was actually known as kano jiu-jitsu or kano jiu-do and later kodokan jiu-do or simply jiu-do or judo
 shuru ke dinon main ise us vaqt tak saamaanya rup se keval jiu-jitsu ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa tha
 The word "judo" derives from the same hieroglyphs from where the word "jujutsu" originated: "jū", which can also mean "gentleness", "tenderness", "flexibility" and "easy" depending on its context
 is
 haalanki jū kaa anuwaad karne ke aise prayaas bhraamak hote hai
 The use of jū in each of these terms is a clear reference to the martial arts theory of the "soft method"
 komal tareeke ko pratidwandvi ko haraane ke liye lagaae jane vaale bal ke apratyaksh anuprayog dwaara abhilakshyit kiya jaataa he
 More specifically, it is the principle of using one's opponent's strengths against them and adapting to changing circumstances
 udhaaharan ke liye, hamalavar par uskaa pratidwandvi hamalaa karne ke liye ek taraf hat saktaa he or use aage kii taraf patakane ke liye apni takat kaa istemaal kar saktaa he 
 kaano ne jujutsu ko chaalon kii ek asangat thili ke rup main dekha jise vah ek siddhant ke anusaar ekajute karnaa chaahate the jiskaa samaadhaan unhen "adhiktam kshamta" kii dharna main mila
 Jujutsu techniques relying only on superior strength were accepted or rejected in favor of redirecting the opponent's force, distorting the opponent's balance, or using better leverage
 judo or jujutsu ke duusare lakshanon main antar he
 Where jujutsu means "art" of tenderness, "science", or "technique", judo means "path" of tenderness
 "dō" ke istemaal, jiskaa matlab rasta, sadak yaa path he, main darshanik makasad chipa hua he
 This is similar to the difference between Budo and Bujutsu
 is shabd ke istemaal se pracheen marshall art ke us vichaar ko nikaal diya gaya he jiskaa ekmaatr uddeshy jaan se maarna tha
 Kano saw judo as a means of overcoming and improving himself physically, mentally, emotionally and morally
 He also expanded the physical principle of maximum potential in daily life and developed it into "mutual prosperity"
 is sambandh main, judo ko dojo kii bandishon ke baahar acchhee tarah se jivan kaa vistaar karne ke ek samgr drushtikon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The practitioner of judo is known as judoka or "judo practitioner", although traditionally only those with fourth dan or higher status were called "judoka"
 jab kisi angrezi sangya shabd ke saath -ka pratyay jod diya jaataa he to iskaa matlab ek aise vyakti se hota he jo us vishay kaa visheshgy hota he yaa jiske paas us vishay kaa vishesh gyaan hota he
 Other practitioners below the fourth dan were called Kenkyu-sei or "trainees"
 aadhunik samay main judoka kaa matlab kisi bhi str kii visheshgyata vaale judo abhyaasakarta se he
 The judo teacher is called sensei
 sensei shabd kii utpatti sen yaa saki or sei se hui he jiskaa matlab us vyakti se he jo aapse pehle aayaa he
 In the Western Dojo, it is common for any trainer with dan status to be called a sensei
 paramparaagat rup se, vah kitaab chauthe dan yaa usase oonche darje ke prashikshakon ke liye arakshit he
 Traditionally Judo practitioners wear a white colored uniform called Judogi which generally means the "judo dress" worn to practice Judo
 kabhi-kabhi is shabd ko chota karke keval 'gi ' ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Judogi was produced by Kano in 1907, and later similar uniforms were adopted by many other martial arts
 aadhunik judogi safed yaa nile rang kii sooti ke kapade kii karshan dori vaali pant or isse mail khaati hui safed yaa nile rang kii sooti ke kapade kii razaai kii tarah sili hui jacket se bana hota he jise ek belt se kas diya jaataa he
 The belt or waistband is usually colored to indicate status or position
 jacket ko is iraade se banaaya jaataa he ki vah kushti ke dabaav ko jhel sake or isiilie ise karate kii vardi kii tulana main kaaphi motaa banaaya jaataa he
 The Judogi is made in such a way that it is easy to hold the opponent on it while Karategi is made from the material that makes the raincoat coat so that the opponent cannot get hold of this material
 aajkal ke nile judogi ke istemaal kaa sabase pehla suzav 1986 ke maustrict ijeef disi meeting main anton gisink ne diya tha
 For the competition, one of the two contestants wears a blue color pair to make it easier for judges, decision-makers and spectators to differentiate the two
 In Japan, both judokas use a white colored judogi and a traditional red sash is affixed to a contestant's belt
 Outside of Japan, a colored sash can also be used to facilitate minor contestants' contests, a blue color pair only required for regional or high level competitions
 japani abhyaasakarta or shuddhtavaadi nile range ke judogi ke istemaal ko tuchh samajhate hai
 While judo includes various types of legs, such as rolling, falling, throwing, squatting, strangulation, jiggling and attacking joints, more attention is paid to throwing and groundwork in particular
 phenkane kii takanic ko do tarah ke takneekon ke samooh main vibhajit kiya gaya he jisame se ek he - sthaayee takanic or doosraa he - sacrifice techniques 
 iske alaava sthaayee takanic ko hand techniques, hip techniques or foot and leg techniques main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The sacrifice technique is divided into those in which the thrower falls directly backwards and those in which he falls onto his side
 jamini ladaai kii takneekon ko attacks against the joints or joint locks, strangleholds or chokeholds or holding or pinning techniques main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 a type of boxing is practiced in judo known as randori which means "free practice"
 randori main, do pratidwandvi judo kii kisi bhi patakane yaa pakadaney kii takanic kaa istemaal karke ek duusare par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 Kata retains techniques of hitting, such as kicking and punching, as well as knives and swordplay techniques
 is tarah kaa adhyaapan aam taur par oonche darje ke abhyaasakartaaon ke liye arakshit hota he, lekin pratiyogita main isaki manaahi hoti he or suraksha kii drushti se aam taur par randori main ise nishedh kar diya jaataa he
 From the point of view of safety, strangulation, dislocating joints and sacrificial techniques are banned on the basis of age and status
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main galaa ghontne kii takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye vyakti kii umr 13 yaa usase adhik honi chahie or bhujaaon ko uljhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye 16 yaa usase adhik umr kaa hona jaruri he
 In the practice of rhetoric and competition, when one opponent is able to use a strangulation or joint manipulation technique, the other opponent gives up or is "beaten" and thus beats the opponent twice
 Giving up gives a clear indication that the opponent has lost
 jab aisa hota he to match khatm ho jaataa he or maat khaane vaala khilaadi haar jaataa he or us par kiye gaye galaa ghontne yaa jodon ko uljhane kii takanic se use aaazaad kar diya jaataa he
 Spun forms are pre-arranged methods of attack and defense that are practiced in judo with a partner for the purpose of mastering the techniques of judo
 adhik vishesh rup se, unke uddeshyon main shaamil hai - judo ke buniyadi siddhanton ko samajhaana, takanic ke sahi istemaal kaa pradarshan karnaa, un darshanik siddhanton kii shiksha dena jis par judo aadhaarit he, un takneekon ke abhyaas kii ijaajat dena jinhen pratiyogita main istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin hoti he or un pracheen takneekon ko surakshit rakhana jo aitihaasik drushti se mahatvapurn he lekin jinka ab samakaleen judo main istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he
 Knowledge of different types of spun is required to get high status
 aaj ke daur main kodocan dwaara manyata praapt saat kata is prakaar hai: There are also some spun ones that have not been officially recognized by Kodokan but continue to practice
 inkaa sabase pramukh udhaaharan 'go no sen no kata' naamak ek kata he jisamen prayasarat prahaar par javaabi hamalaa karne par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Judo emphasizes a free-style boxing practice called randori which is one of its main forms of training
 mukaable ke samay kaa kuch bhaag mukkebaaji ke abhyaas ko sthaayee banane main lag jaataa he jise tachi-waja kehete hai or baaki kaa bhaag jameen par lagata he jise ne-waja kehete hai
 Boxing is also practiced according to the rules of safety, which is more lively than simply practicing the techniques that jujutsuka used to do before
 puri takat ke istemaal se shaareerik drushti se mansapeshiyon or hridayavahini tantra kaa vikaas hota he or maansik drushti se ranneeti or pratikriya samay kaa vikaas hota he or ek virdohi pratidwandvi ke khilaaf takneekon kaa istemaal karne kii sikh hasil karne main abhyaasakarta ko madad milti he
 There is a common saying among judokas, “the best training of judo is judo
 " There are many types of boxing exercises, such as Xu Renshu; And Kakari Geiko judo main, ladaai karne ke do mukhya charan hote hai: khadaa hokar yaa sthaayee charan, tachi-waja ; or jamini charan, ne-waja ; prayek charan ke liye apni khud kii takneekon, ranneetiyon, randori, condishning yaa anukulan, ityadi kii jarurat padati he
 Special training in "transitional" techniques is also given to bridge the gap
 judoka ek charan main kaaphi kushal ho saktaa he or duusare charan main thodaa kamjor bhi pad saktaa he jo is baat par nirbhar karata he ki unki zyaadaatar dilchaspee kismen hai haalanki zyaadaatar donon ke darmyaan santulit hote hai
 Judo's inclusion of both permanent and on-field stages of combat gives Judoka the ability to pull down her permanent or standing opponent and then force her to surrender by giving her trouble on the ground
 sthaayee yaa khadey charan main, jise pratiyogita ke niyamon ke anusaar pradhanta milti he, pratidwandvi ek duusare ko patakane kii koshish karte hai yaa khadey hokar jodon ko uljhane or galaa ghontkar / galaa dabaakar samarpan karne par majaboor karne vaali takanic kaa istemaal karte hai jabaki niyam ke hisaab se khadey yaa sthaayee charan main aisa bahut kam hota he kyonki patakane kii tulana main khadey rahakar in takneekon kaa istemaal karnaa zyada mushkil hota he
 However, some judokas are quite adept at using both techniques of forcing their opponent down, as well as forcing them to surrender, where the technique of forcing surrender begins in a standing position and ends on the ground
 it occurs
 haalanki jodon ko uljhaakar patakane kii takanic kaa istemaal karnaa nishiddh he
 The main purpose of the downward technique is to slam an opponent standing on his feet, standing in a dynamic position or standing in a dangerous position, on the ground on his back where he cannot move as effectively
 is prakaar, neeche giraane yaa patakane kii mukhya vajah pratidwandvi ko kaabo main karnaa or khud ko prabhaavshaalee sthiti main laana he
 In this way the practitioner has more ability to produce a conclusive result
 pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane kaa ek or kaaran jameen par use jabardastee patakekar uske sharir ko chot pahunchaana bhi he
 If the opponent downsizes his opponent with great force and complete control, he can clearly win the match on the basis that he has demonstrated sufficient superiority, being given less points if he falls down less effectively
 is
 khadey hokar apane pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane par hi giraanevaale pratidwandvi ko ank diya jaataa he
 In harmony with Kano's mastery of scientific analysis and reasoning, standard Kodokan judo pedagogy determines that any downward technique is theoretically a four-step phenomenon: distorting equilibrium; body positioning; execution; And finally the finish or coup de grâce
 Each step is followed quite rapidly after the previous stage; Ideally all steps follow almost simultaneously
 isi tarah, chot lagane kii zyada sambhaavna hone kii vajah se maarane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin di jaati he lekin khilaadi ko prashikshan ke dauraan "is takanic ko dhyaan main rakhana" hota he, udhaaharan ke liye, zyada der tak jhukkar ladaai na karnaa, kyonki is sthiti main badi aasaani se ghutanon par hamalaa karke yaa anya jagahon par hamalaa karke ghayal kiya ja saktaa he
 In the competition, the contest on the ground may continue after the downing process or else the contestants may legally end their fight on the ground; Contestants are not allowed to fall to the ground just to start the ne-vaja
 jameen par, pratiyogiyon kaa lakshya apane pratidwandvi kaa galaa ghontkar yaa galaa dabaakar yaa uski bhujaaon ko uljhaakar yaa to use neeche giraae rakhana yaa use samarpan karne par majaboor kar dena he
 Hold downs, self-defense, police work and military hands-on combat are important because the person who overcomes his opponent can defend or attack quite easily
 judo main, yadi pakad kar neeche giraane kii koshish ko pachchis second tak banaae rakhaa jaataa he, to is takanic kaa istemaal karne vaala vyakti match jeet jaataa he
 Osakomi tries to knock his opponent down primarily by holding his back and if he turns to the front or side, a mat will be called
 
 After that the two judokas will stand again and after that they will continue their fight or continue fighting
 1905 main sthapit niyamon ke anusaar, pratidwandvi ko keval uske kandhon se do second tak pakad kar rakhana jaruri tha—kaha jaataa he ki ek samurai ko apni chaaku yaa talwaar tak pahunchane or apane pakade hue pratidwandvi ko haarane ke liye itnaa hi samay lagata tha
 The new longer requirements may relate to the combat reality that the fighter, police officer, or soldier must stagnate their opponent in sufficient time to establish control over the situation
 judo main, kabhi-kabhi pakad kar rakhane kii takanic ke parinamswaroop pratidwandvi samarpan kar saktaa he yadi us pratidwandvi main us pakad ke dabaav ko sahane kii kshamta na ho yaa pakad ko banaae rakhane ke liye samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii takanic kaa istemaal kiya gaya ho
 In addition, if the technique of strangling or engaging the arms becomes too heavy on the judoka, or if the judoka starts to ache or gets hurt, he can surrender
 agar pakad kar giraae jane vaale vyakti ne apane pairon ko apane pratidwandvi ke sharir ke nichle bhaag yaa dhad ke kisi hisse ke ird-gird lapet liya he to vah bhi apane pratidwandvi ko utana hi giraane kii koshish kar rahaa hota he jitani koshish uskaa pratidwandvi use giraane ke liye kar rahaa hota he kyonki uskaa pratidwandvi tab tak khadaa nahin ho saktaa he or aaazaad nahin ho saktaa he jab tak neeche uske sharir se lipta hua vyakti use nahin chodta he
 The bottom man can use various attacking techniques on his opponent, including strangling, entangling arms, while wrapping his legs around his opponent to make him unable to attack effectively from above
 And "body Scissors", meaning 'causing difficulty in breathing by putting pressure on the body'
 is haalat main, jise japani bhashaa main "do-osa " kehete hai jiskaa matlab "trunk hold" arthath 'dhad par dabaav banaae rakhana' he, upar vaala vyakti osakomi kahalaane vaali is sthiti kii vajah se apane pratidwandvi par paryaapt niyantran nahin rakh paata he
 The person above may try to escape from his opponent's feet and in turn force him to fall down or surrender, or he may try to break his opponent's guard and stand up
 neeche vaala vyakti apane guard vaali takanic kii madad se apane pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii koshish kar saktaa he yaa apane pratidwandvi ke upar chadhane ke liye use ludhakaane kii koshish kar saktaa he
 Joint lock ie 'jointing technique' is generally known as 'arm lock' ie 'arm entangling technique'
 yah mukaable kii prabhaavshaalee takanic he kyonki isse ek judoka apane pratidwandvi ko dard dekar use apane kaabo main karne main sakasham ho jaataa he yaa jarurat padane par uljhaae hue jodon ko bhi todane main sakasham ho jaataa he
 The use of the technique of engaging the elbow joints by applying almost full force in the competition to force your opponent to surrender is considered quite safe
 ateet main, judo main pairon ko uljhane, kalai ko uljhane, ridh kii haddi ko uljhane or vibhinn tarah kii anya takneekon kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat thi jise khilaadiyon kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pratiyogita main varjit kar diya gaya he
 It has been decided that players will suffer many injuries due to attacking those joints and due to this, the condition of those joints will gradually deteriorate
 Nevertheless, some judokas still enjoy informally learning and fighting each other using these techniques that are prohibited in formal competitions but related arts such as Sambo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and jujutsu are still in them
 Many techniques have been actively used since
 Chokes and strangulations ko aam taur par or saamaanya rup se galaa dabaakar dam ghontne kii takanic ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 With this help a person can use the strangling technique to make his opponent unconscious and even to sleep to death
 galaa dabaane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne par gardan kii greeva dhamni par dabaav padane se mastishk tak hone vaali khun kii aapurti band ho jaati he jabaki galaa ghontne kii takanic kaa istemaal karne par gardan ke saamne kaa vayumarg avaruddha ho jaataa he
 These words are often used interchangeably and are not formally differentiated in their use by most judokas
 pratiyogita main, us samay judoka kii jeet ho jaati he jab uskaa pratidwandvi samarpan kar detaa he yaa behosh ho jaataa he, kyonki galaa dabaane kii takanic kaa sahi tarah se istemaal hone par pratidwandvi bas kuch second main hi behosh ho saktaa he lekin iske baad turant mukt kar dene par aam taur par koi nuksaan nahin hota he
 Judo has evolved into a sport, along with a completely specialized martial art
 olympic main pehali baar judo ko los angeles main yojit 1932 games main dekha gaya tha jahaan kaano or lagbhag 200 judo chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In the 1964 Games held in Tokyo, judo became an Olympic sport for men
 rena kanokogi, ek america or kai anya kii jidd kii vajah se 1988 main judo mahilaon kaa bhi ek olympic khel ban gaya
 It is often said that the men's judo event in 1964 was a demonstration event, but according to the International Judo Federation (international Judo Union) and the International Olympic Committee, the International Olympic Committee, judo was actually an official sport of the 1964 Games
 hollandwasi anton gisink ne japan ke akiyo kaminaga ko haraakar judo ke open divizan main pehla olympic swarna padak praapt kiya
 Judo's image of being "japanese only" was then lost and became one of the most widely practiced sports in the world
 mahilaon kaa kaarykram 1988 kaa ek pradarshan kaarykram tha or chaar saal baad yah ek aadhikarik padak kaarykram ban gaya
 Men and women compete separately, although they often receive training together
 1988 ke baad se paraolympic judo ek paraolympic khel bana hua he; yah special olympic kaa khel bhi he
 Collegiate competition in the United States, particularly between UC Berkeley and San Jose State University, contributed to refining judo in sports seen at the Olympic Games and World Championships
 1940 ke dashak main henry stone or yosh uchida, cyle or esageesayu ke pramukh coach, ne skulon ke bich aksar hone vaali pratiyogitaaon main istemaal karne ke liye ek wet class system arthath vajan varg pranali viksit kii
 In 1953, Stone and Uchida made a successful request to the Amateur Athletic Union to accept judo as a sport, with their weight class system as an official component
 1961 main, uchida ne paris main ijeef kii baithkon main sanyukt rajya america kaa pratinidhitiv kiya jahaan ijeef ne sabhi bhavi championships ke liye wet class system ko apana liya
 The IJF was built mostly on the basis of the early European Judo Union where weight class systems were also used for many years
 vartmaan main saat wet divizan hai jisamen shaasi nikaayon dwaara badlaav kiya ja saktaa he or pratiyogiyon kii umr ke aadhaar par inamen sanshodhan bhi kiya ja saktaa he: The objective of traditional judo rules is to avoid injury to the participants and to ensure proper etiquette
 dekhne waalon ke liye is khel ko or dilachasp banane ke liye in niyamon main kuch or niyam shaamil kiye gaye
 Penalties can be imposed for staying inactive or using illegal techniques during a match
 yadi koi pratibhaagi mat ke nirdhaarit kshetra ke baahar chalaa jaataa he to ladaai band kar di jaani chahie
 If the groundwork means that the judges and judges need some deliberation during the fight, then the adjudicator will say sono-mama and both will have to stay in the same position
 jab unka kaam ho jaataa he to nirnaayak yoshi kahata he or match chaalu ho jaataa he
 All marks or penalties are awarded by the judge
 nirnaayak dwaara die gaye ank yaa dand ko badalane ke liye nyaayakarta ek faisla le sakate hai
 There is a slight difference in IJF rules to facilitate the judo of blind people
 judo ke ek match kaa uddeshy pratidwandvi ko uske kandhon ke bal jameen par patakana; mukhya rup se uski peeth ke bal jameen par giraanaa; yaa uskaa galaa ghontkar, dam ghontkar yaa uski bhujaaon ko uljhaakar use samarpan karne par majaboor karnaa he
 Ippon is awarded as a point for one of these, after which the match is won immediately
 judo main ank praapt karne ke teen grad yaa darje hai: ippon, waja-ari or yuko 
 ippon kaa shabdic arth "ek ank" hota he jisase match jeeta jaataa he
 Rapidly and vigorously in a controlled manner, the opponent mostly slams his back to the ground; Keeping your opponent on the mat for a substantial period; Or an Ippon is given to force the opponent to surrender
 ippon paane laayak paryaapt shakti yaa niyantran ke pradarshan ke abhaav ke saath pratidwandvi ko jameen par patakane; yaa bees second tak use jameen par giraae rakhane ke liye ek waja-ari diya jaataa he
 a vaja-ari means half a mark and if a vaja-ari is attained, then a full score is made from them which is necessary to win
 yuko, ank praapt karne kaa nichalaa darja he or isaki ginati keval ek 'taai braker' ke rup main kii jaati he; ise anya yuko ankon ke saath nahin joda jaataa he
 Scoring is lexicographic; a Vaja-ari beats out any number of Yuko, but a Vaja-ari and a Yuko outperform the Yukoless Vaja-ari
 apane pratidwandvi pandrah second tak jameen par giraae rakhane par yuko ank praapt hota he
 If a person who uses the technique of knocking down has already received a Vaja-ari, then he or she needs to hold their opponent down to the ground for only twenty seconds in order to earn an Ippon point through two vaja-aris
 
 ek ippon yaa ek waja-ari ank kii aavashyaktaaon ke abhaav ke saath pratidwandvi ko jameen par patakane ke liye ek yuko ank praapt ho saktaa he
 The so-called "skillful takedown" is also allowed to "fall to the ground efficiently" but no points are obtained for it
 yadi match ke ant main kul prapthank ekasmaan hote hai, to is samasya ko golden score' arthath 'swarna ank niyam dwaara suljhaayaa jaataa he
 The Golden Score is an accidental death situation where the clock is re-set for the time of the match, and meanwhile the contestant who wins the first point wins
 agar is avadhi ke dauraan koi ank hasil nahin kiya jaataa he, to hantei arthath 'nirnaayak or do mukhya nyaayakartaaon ke bahumat vichaar' ke madhyam se vijeta kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Judo's scoreboard shows the number of vaja-ari and Yuko received by each player
 ippon dene par match turant khatm ho jane kii vajah se scoreboard par aksar ippon ko nahin dikhaaya jaataa he
 Some computerized scoreboards may indicate a clear indication of an Ippon score
 aam taur par scoreboard par prayek khilaadi ko die gaye dandon kii sankhya or kabhi-kabhi prayek ko di gai chikitsa vyavastha kii sankhya ko bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 Electronic scoreboards also typically have a timer to measure both contest time and ossecomy time
 vibhinn suraksha sambandhon kaarnon se judo ke niyam hameshaa badalte rahete hai
 They may change depending on the age, status or experience of the judoka
 desh, club yaa pratiyogita ke str ke aadhaar par bhi unamem badlaav ho saktaa he 
 The first is a warning in the form of a penalty that is written on the scoreboard
 duusare dand ke rup main pratidwandvi ko "yuko" ank diya jaataa he
 "vaja-ari" marks are given as the third penalty
 chauthe dand ko "hansoku maake" kaha jaataa he or pratidwandvi ko ek "ippon" ank de diya jaataa he
 The match ends permanently with "hansoku Māke"
 gambhir niyamollanghanon ke liye pratiyogi ko ek pratyaksh "hansoku maake" mil saktaa he
 In this case, the player receiving the "hansoku Makae" is eliminated from the tournament
 judo, duniya bhar ke kai sainya akramanakari or rakshaatmak ranneetiyon ke prashikshan kaa aadhaar ban gaya he
 In addition, the combination of judo's background in traditional jujitsu with its police and military uses has resulted in the arrival of kata specifically geared to training the technical principles of self-defense: kime no kata and kodokan goshin jutsu
 Renkoho Vaja includes techniques specifically designed for the police
 joshi judo goshinho main mahilaon kii aatmaraksha kii taikniken shaamil hai
 Other spun groups include self-defense techniques with more difficult methods
 judo ke siddhanton or prashikshan ke tareekon ke vibhinn pahaluon se aatmaraksha main madadgaar sabit hone vaale gunon or kaushalon ko badhaava miltaa he: However, there are some criticisms about the use of judo for self-defense training: apane ne-waja / guttham-gutthi or tachi-waja / khadey hokar guttham-gutthi ke gyaan kaa istemaal karne judo abhyaasakartaaon ne mishrit marshall arts maichon main bhi pratispardhaa kii he

 British ecologist Arthur Tansley later refined the term, describing it as "the whole system 


 not only the organism complex, but also the whole complex of all the physical factors that we call the environment"
 tansle paaritantron ko na keval prakritik ikaiyaan ke rup main, balki "maansik isolats" ke rup main bhi maanate the
 Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope"
 paristhitiki tantra avadharana kaa mukhya vichaar yah he ki jivit jeev apane sthaneey parivesh main har duusare tatv ko prabhavit karaten hai
 Eugene Odum, a founder of Ecology said: "an entity that includes all organisms that affect the physical environment is that a flow of energy within the system is a clearly defined nutritional structure, biotic variation and material cycle an ecosystem

 machhliyon ke paale jane ke pramaan kam se kam 4,500 varsh purv tak ke praapt hue hai, jab sumer nivasee bhojan ke liye unhen haujon yaa pokharon main paalate the
 But it is possible that this practice has been prevalent even before this

 Public aquariums are established in many main cities of different countries

 Small, but well-known, aquariums are located in cities like Madras, Hawaiian Islands, Australia, South Africa, and Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, etc
 in the United States

 They are different aquariums, whose purpose is mainly scientific research

 Along with them, small livelihoods are also there for the public

 In view of the convenience, the walls of aquariums are made of mud
 bade jalaashyon kii deevaaren ek se dedh inch mote kaach kii hoti hai
 Maintaining the necessary heat and chemical composition of water is essential for taking care of public aquacultures and also resolving problems related to health, food, diseases and parasites of aquatic animals
 jahaan uchit prakaar kaa jal aavashyak pariman main sulabh hota he, vahaan mashiinon dwaara aavashyak jal kii purti saralata se hoti he
 Fresh water is mixed with municipal water reservoirs, but the residue of chlorine gas used to kill bacteria of this water is first isolated, as this gas damages the organisms of the reservoir
 yadi jalashay ke liye samudri pani aavashyak he, to samudr ke aise sthaan se jal lete hai jahaan nadiyon se ai hui, yaa anya prakaar se giranevaali, gandagiyaan na hon
 In such places, due to storms, water may be unfit for use, so in many places there is such a arrangement that once filled water in the Hauj keeps circulating, and the filtering and fitting operations are completed on the way

 Some food items are found in the markets, but some food reservoir workers have to find and collect
 parjiviyon tathaa rog or mahamariyon se raksha kar vishesh dhyaan dena chahie
 Treatment of diseases of aquatic animals is difficult, so preventive measures have proved more effective
 chikitsa ke liy mukhyat: jeev ko aise vilyan main rakh dete hai jisamen usko koi haani na pahunche, kintu sankramak jeevanu mar jaaen
 If the water in the reservoir is not allowed to cool, then there is no special fear of diseases and parasites

 There is a false belief that stable aquatic flora is oxidized by the flora present in the above mentioned aquariums
 vastav main baat iske vipareet he
 Vegetation also takes oxygen from water and gives carbon dioxide at night, or on cloudy days, in the same way as aquatic organisms; But the presence of flora in these livestock has other advantages
 machhliyon tathaa anya jeevon ke sharir se jo mel ityadi nikalate hai ve vanaspatiyon ke liye khaad ke kaam aa jate hai or is tarah jal main gandagi nahin ekatrit hone paati
 Flora also enhances the beauty of the reservoir

 If the intermediate level of water and air in the reservoir is sufficiently wide, then this work is automatically performed
 yadi aisa nahin he, to sookshm bulabulon ke rup main pump yaa anya kisi upaay se jal ke bheetar se vaayu kaa nishkasana karana aavashyak hota he
 If the quantity of fauna and flora in any reservoir is balanced with the climate-mediated-level area, work can be done without special arrangement of air circulation

 The male gluttonous fennel of the combat fish of the Siamese makes it a habitat

 The fish of the Siklidi caste keep their eggs and children in their mouths for protection and do not feed for the number of days the eggs are not released from the eggs
 jaljivshaala kii machhliyon ke bhojan kii samasya vishesh kathin nahin he
 They are fed by the simple food items of the fish and micro-aquatic animals
 gharelu jeevashaalaon kii machhliyon ke liye dhan yaa bhujiyaa chaaval kaa lava bhi upyukt paaya gaya he
 The remaining food makes the water dirty
 machhliyon ko atyalp aahaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Therefore, there is a greater possibility of this mistake that instead of giving less food, more food should be given than required
 yah dhyaan rakhana sadaiv aavashyak he ki jalaashyon main utana hi bhojan daalaa jaae jitna khap sake
 The aforementioned principles for the maintenance of aquariums apply to all methods of fishing, whether small home shelters for decoration, or gardens, or the pools of fish that are fed for food
 lagbhag sabhi deshon kii sarkaron ne, saarvajanik jalaashyon main yathesht machhliyaan banaae rakhane ke liye, vishesh matsayshaalaaon main machhliyon ke rakhane, unke andon kaa sangrakshan tathaa bacchon ke paalane kaa prabandh kiya he
 Where possible, there is also a provision for hatching and raising children by keeping the eggs separate from the fish

 It was made an independent administrative unit in the ottoman-afghan period

 In 1875, it was separated from Bengal and divided into two districts, namely Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga

 This article is not about Sanskrit Mahakavi Bhasa's work 'dootavakya'
 dootkavy, sanskrit kavy kii ek vishisht parampara he jiskaa aarambh bhaas tathaa ghatkarper ke kaavyon or mahakavi kalidas ke meghdoot main miltaa he, tathaapi, iske beej or adhik puraane prathit hote hai
 The passage described by Valmiki in the poems in which Rama sent his viraha message to Sita is considered to be the beginning link of this tradition
 swayan kalidas ne bhi apane "meghdoot" main is baat kaa sanket kiya he ki unhen megh ko doot banane kii prerana valmiki "ramayana" ke hanumanvaale prasang se mili he
 On the other hand, the seeds of this tradition also appear to be located in folklore, where the Virhi and the Virhinis plead to carry the message by birds of their loving relatives, Bhramar, Shuk, Chatak, Kak etc
 "ghatkarper" kavy main keval 22 padya uplabdh hai, jinamein akaash main ghire megh ko dekhakar ek virahinee ne apane virah kii vyanjana karai he
 The other characteristic of this poetry is the use of padanta yamaka ornamentation with paraphrasing

 Due to this pledge, the title of the author became "ghatkarpar" and we do not know his real name
 kuch vidvan is rachana ko kalidas krit maanate hai, kintu yah siddh ho chukaa he ki yah kalidas kii rachana nahin he
 The time of "ghatkarpar" is an indefinite one, as according to early tradition, "ghatkarpar" was also one of Vikramaditya's Navratnas
 keval itnaa kaha ja saktaa he ki is kavy k rachana kalidas se puraani he
 The powerful work of this tradition is the "meghdoot" of Mahakavi Kalidasa, in which the Yaksha, exiled by Kubera to Mount Ramagiri, through his unconscious cloud sends a message to his Priya in distant Alakapuri that he is somehow of the exile period
 Let the rest of the month pass and then they will fulfill all their aspirations in the dusty nights with the moonlight of Sharad

 In the 12th century Adhmana, a weaver from Multan, composed a poem in the style of Rasak Gitikavya in which the Virahini heroine begs a wanderer to carry a message to her beloved on her way to Khambhat
 is kavy main nayika ke saundaryavarnan ke atirikt romantic shadritu varnan or nayika kii virahadasha kii maarmik abhivyanjana uplabdh he
 In Hindi, "dhola Maru Ra Duha", there are some couplets, whose form is of the messenger style
 iske atirikt hindi premakhyaan kaavyon main aise sthal uplabdh hai, jahaan virahi pranayi ne apane priy ke prati kisi madhyam se sandesh pahunchaane kii cheshtaa kii he
 In this connection, some of the available sites can be indicated in Jayasi's "nagamtivirah narration"
 isi tarah hindi krishnakavy main bhramaragit parampara ke antargat dootkavy yaa sandeshkavy ke kuch beej mil jaayenge
 The style of Dootkavya or Sandeshkavya in Malayalam originates from the "neelkanthsandesh" of Kerala Varma, who sent a message from prison to his wife via Neelkanth
