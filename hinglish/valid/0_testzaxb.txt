 a type of word defect in poetry
 jab kavita main aise gramin shabdon kaa adhik prayog hota he jinka prachlan kisi kshetra vishesh main hi hota he, aise shabdon ke prayog se kavita main graamy dosha mana jaataa he
 Definition: According to Acharya Mammatt, the main element of poetry is defect, the teacher

 The art and practice of discussing and negotiating an issue by representatives of nations or groups is called diplomacy
 aaj ke vaigyanik yug main koi desh alag-alag nahin rah saktaa
 In these countries, it has become necessary to add mutual relations in these countries
 in sambandhon ko jodne ke liye yogya vyakti ek desh se duusare desh main bheje jate hai
 These people, by their ability, skill and diplomacy, often make friends of another country
 pracheen kaal main bhi ek rajya duusare rajya se kootnithik sambandh jodne ke liye apane kootneetijna bhejtaa tha
 Earlier, diplomacy used to mean 'in the deal or transaction, the sentence is chaturi, deceit-deception, cheating
' jo vyakti kam mulya dekar adhikadhik laabh apane desh ke liye praapt karata tha, kushal kootneetijna kehalaata tha
 But today, deceit is not called diplomacy
 vaigyanik drushti se aadhunik kaal main is shabd kaa prayog do rajyon main shantipurna samjhaute ke liye kiya jaataa he
 For diplomacy, the word diplomacy is being used in place of diplomacy in Hindi
 anterrashtriya jagat ek parivaar ke samaan ban gaya he
 It is the job of a skilled diplomat to add love, cooperation, goodwill and friendship among family members
 'rajnay' shabd angreji shabd 'diplomaisi' kaa hindi roopaantaran he
 The word diplomacy originated from the Greek word diplown which means to twist or repeat
 greek rajyon ke patan ke baad roman samrajya kaa vikaas hua
 In the Roman Empire, passports and permission to walk on the streets were doubled and sealed
 ye paasapart tathaa anumati patr dhaatu ke patron par khude rahete the
 These were called 'diplomas'
 dhire-dhire diploma shabd kaa prayog sabhi sarkari kagajaton ke liye hone laga
 The documents related to foreigners' privileges or immunities and foreign treaties also came to be called 'diplomas'
 jab in sandhiyon kii sankhya adhik ho gai to unhen surikshat sthanon par rakhaa jane laga
 These places were later known as 'state archives'
 rajbhilekhagaaron ke diplomaj kii sankhya badhane par unako chhaant kar alag karne ore unki dekhbhaal rakhane ke liye alag se karmchaaree niyukt kiye jane lage
 The work of these employees was called a diplomatic act
 dhire-dhire is kaary vyapaar ke liye diplomasi shabd prayukt hone laga
 The word diplomacy has been used by thinkers in many ways
 herold nickelson ke anusaar kabhi iskaa prayog videsh niti ke samanarthak ke rup main liya jaataa he, jaise bhartiya rajnay padosi deshon main safal nahin rahi
 Sometimes the term refers to treaty negotiations, such that this problem can be solved by diplomacy
 rajnay sandhi vaarta kii prakriya evam yantra ko bhi ingit karata he
 Sometimes a branch of the Foreign Service is called diplomacy
 rajnay ko anterrashtriya sandhi vaarta karne kaa amoort gun yaa kushalta bhi maan liya jaataa he
 Its most corrupt use is when it is taken in a fraudulent act
 is prakaar rajnay shabd vibhinn arthon main prayeg kiye jane ke kaaran pathak ke man main bhram utpann kar detaa he
 Perhaps the term is most confusing in political science
 is vishay main aargensky ne kaha he ki 'kushalta, chaturaai evam kapat’ sareekhe gun ek achche rajnay ke lakshan ho sakate hai kintu inhen rajnay ko paribhaashit karne vaali visheshta nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Not even equivalent to diplomatic foreign policy
 yah videsh niti kaa aisa ang he jo uski rachana or kriyanviti main sakriy yogadan karata he
 ' argenski ke ansaar- According to Sir Ernest Saints, is sambandh main paamar tathaa parkins ne yah jigyaasa prakat kii he ki yadi rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon main buddhi or chaaturya kaa abhaav he to kya rajnay asambhav hoga ? spasht he ki rajnay do athwa do se adhik swatantra rajyon ke madhya sthit sambandh he tadnusaar prayek rajya buddhi, kushalta evam chaaturya kaa prayog karata he
 In the words of KM Panikkar, quinci rhite ne rajnay ko do arthon main paribhaashit kiya he - lokapriy arth main tathaa vishesh arth main
 In the popular sense - is paribhaasha kii khaas baat yah he ki lokapriy arth main rajnay ko aisi sandhi-vaarta mana gaya he jo dabaav par nahin varan samajhane-bujhane par aadhaarit rahati he
 In its special sense, diplomats have been considered devotional towards the national interest
 raajnneeti shaastra main rajnay kaa lokapriy arth lagu nahin hota
 In international relations, diplomacy only works where there is a possibility of pressure
 rajnay dwaara in sambhaawanaaon ko dabaaya jaataa he
 The purpose of diplomacy is to make agreements and agreements are made only where there are some disagreements
 ye asahmatiyaan aisi honi chaiye jinamein vaarta dwaara sahmati kaayam kii ja sake
 Diplomacy is irrelevant in areas of absolute consensus and it is ineffective in areas of absolute disagreement
 rabrto regela ke anusaar rajnay shabd kaa kaaphi durupyog hua he
 Actually, diplomacy is a profession that involves many activities
 yah duniya ke aise kuch vyavsaayon main se ek he jisaki paridhi main maanviya kriya kii prayek shakha shaamil ho jaati he
 Its power politics is related to the struggle of economic power and ideologies
 regela rajnay ko ‘samjhauta vaarta kii kala’ maanata he
 In 1796, Edmund Burke, while defining diplomacy, wrote that diplomacy is the operation or operation of international relations
 george epa0 kenon kaa kahana he ki takneekee arth main rajnay kii vyavastha sarkaron ke bich sampark ke rup main kii ja sakati he
 Thus, different thinkers have given different definitions of diplomacy
 ye sabhi paribhaashayen purnatah upyukt nahin hai kyonki samay tathaa paristhitiyon main parivartan ke saath-saath rajnay kaa arth bhi badalata rahata he
 Many thinkers have considered diplomacy not only as an occupation but also an art
 adhikansh sarkarein apane hiton kii prapti evam abhivruddhi ke liye ise apnaane lagi he
 It is gradually becoming an effective means of peace
 shuru main rajya aseemit shaktiyon se sampann hote the faltah rajanyagyaan ko samprabhu mana jaataa tha
 They were given enough freedom to work
 is swatantraaa kaa anya kaaran yah tha ki us samay sanchaar ke drutagami sadhano kaa abhaav tha
 This widespread independence of diplomats began to be limited in the late 19th century
 us samay rajnay kii ek anya visheshta yah bhi thi ki rajanyagnon ko unke kaary se sambandhit aadesh tathaa nirdesh dekar hi bheja jaataa tha
 Nowadays it has not been necessary due to the convenience of rapid means of communication
 rajnay ko kuch log ek rahasypurna vyavsaay maanate hai
 this is not right
 hoodh gibason ke anusaar, ”asal main rajnay ek bhramasadhy vyavsaay he
 It is beyond magic or mystery
 ise kisi bhi anya sarkari kaary kii bhaanti ek gambheer vyavsaay ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Palmer and Parikans have described some features of diplomacy
 ye visheshtayen rajnay ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye upyogi siddh hogi
 These features are the following: - nickelson kaa yah kahana thik nahin he ki yuddh armbh hone par rajanyik kaary band ho jate hai, kyonki paamar or parkins ke vichaar se rajanyagnon kaa kaary desh kii raksha karnaa he
 Therefore, during the war, they do not sit hand in hand, but at that time they cooperate in military work
 is prakaar yudhkaal main rajanyagnon kaa kaary rukta nahin, balki unke kaary kaa rup badal jaataa he
 During wartime, the work of diplomacy increases
 pichley do vishwayudhon kii ghatnaon ke avlokan se yah baat spasht ho jaati he
 To understand the nature of diplomacy, it is useful to study its relation and difference with foreign policy, international law and diplomatic politics
 pracheen bharat ke rajwanshon va rajyon main rajnay kii sudeergh parampara rahi he
 The earliest work on statecraft and diplomacy is Arthashastra, attributed to Kautilya, the principal adviser to Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya dynasty
 arthshaastra rajtv kii kala par ek sampurna rachana he
 It also has the principles of diplomacy, which describes how intelligent kings form alliances between mutually competitive states and put their enemies in stalemate
 us samay rajdarbaron ko bheje gayi doot deergh kaal tak rukaa karte the
 There are instructions in economics dealing with messengers
 kaha he ki - raja ke liye sabase badi naitikta he ki uskaa rajya samruddhi ko praapt kare aadi
 The policy to carry out the national program is 'policy'
 yah aantarik athwa bahari kisi bhi ho sakati he
 Internal policy is related to home affairs whereas foreign policy is related to the external arrangements of the nation
 videsh niti or rajnay, raajnneeti ke ve pahiye hai jinaki sahaayta se anterrashtriya raajnneeti chalati he
 Foreign policy is the fulfillment of its objectives in relation to other states by a nation
 aisi videsh niti ke bare main sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa jo rashtriya hiton kii upeksha karen
 Therefore, foreign policy is interpreted as the behavior of the state through which states fulfill their interests
 arvachin yug main koi rajya apane aap main parthaky kii niti apanaakar alag rah saken, yah sarvatha asambhav he
 Foreign policy is made with much thought because the future of the state depends only on its right decision
 videsh niti ke nirmaan main rajya ko kai tatwon kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 For example, the foreign policy of Britain and Japan has been deeply influenced by its geographical location
 rajyon ke prakritik strot athwa unka samrik mahatv aadi rajya kii videsh niti ko prabhavit karte hai
 Underdeveloped states, which continue to receive assistance from various powers and depend on them, can never form an independent foreign policy
 kisi desh kii sainik shakti uski videsh niti ko utsaahi banaakar galat maarg par le jaati he
 Germany, Italy and Japan invaded their neighboring states due to military power and called for world war
 rajyon kii raajnneeti tathaa unki videsh niti kaa nirmaan desh ke rajaneta karte hai, to rajdoot iskaa kriyanyavan
 In determining foreign policy, states have to take into account many perspectives of national and international situations
 jaise rajya kii bhugolic sthiti, aarthik aavashyaktaaen, prakritik strot, pratiraksha kii aavashyaktaaen tathaa sandhiyaan aadi
 Through this, efforts are made to make the adversary or enemy side powerless or the friendly state even more enigmatic
 videsh niti ke madhyam se rajyon ke madhya santulan banaaye rakhane athwa samuhik suraksha aadi ke kadam uthaaye jate hai
 The basic mantra of foreign policy is 'enemy of enemy is friend'
 china ne isi niti ke antargat bharat ke shatru pakistan ke saath maitri sambandh banaaye the
 Similarly, the objective of foreign policy is also to establish 'neutral borders'
 seemaa ke prashn ko lekar rajyon ke madhya sambandh praayah bigadate hai
 There has been a situation of war or war between countries like india-pakistan, india-china, russia-china etc
 rajyon kii aarthik sthiti, vyapaar or vaanijya aadi ke sandarbh main bhi videshniti ke nirnay liye jate hai
 States sometimes lose their right to free decisions in their efforts to attain power
 rajya kii videsh niti ke nirnay uski samrik sthiti tathaa sainik shakti par nirnay karte hai
 The more powerful the state is, the more successful its diplomacy will be
 fradrik mahaan ke anusaar,” shakti bina rajnay thik vaisaa hi he jaisaa vaadun bina sangeet
 “united States diplomacy is successful only because of its power
 yadi koi rajya nirbal ho to vah swayan anya rajyon kaa us desh main hastkshep athwa akraman kaa nimantran detaa he
 The partition of Poland, the making of Italy a European destination, the merger of Austria and Czechoslovakia by Hitler and the invasion of China by India, were possible due to the powerless states
 niti nirmaataaon dwaara apane uddeshyon ko nirdhaarit karne ke pashchaat rajya ke samaksh in uddeshyon kii prapti kaa prashn aata he or yahi rajnay kaa prabhaav drushtigochar hota he
 The state can be active or passive in the field of foreign policy
 yadi rajya sakriy he to rajya ke samaksh chaar vikalp hote hai, jiske aadhaar par vah kaary karata he - raajnneetik aarthik, manovaigyanik tathaa sainik
 Depending on the time and situation, the state can adopt any one of these options or can use its combined form
 niskriyata vartmaan anterrashtriya paristhitiyon main kisi bhi rajya ke liye ghaatak siddh ho sakati he
 States often use the path of diplomacy
 videsh niti kaa uddeshy mitra rajyon ke saath sambandhon ke adhik pragadh or shatru paksh ko niskriy bananaa hota he
 Diplomacy is the tool that helps in achieving this objective through dialogue and cleverness
 videsh niti ke uddeshyon kii prapti kaa sarvocch evam mahatvapurn saadhan hi he
 In fact, foreign policy is the skill of diplomacy
 kisi bhi videsh niti kaa nirmaan in adhikariyon kaa kaary he, vahi duusare deshon ke sandarbh main iskaa kriyanvayan rajdooton kaa
 In this complex era of today, even though technically, the State Department alone is considered the creator of foreign policy, it cannot be denied that ambassadors also contribute significantly in its construction
 rajdoot kii gatividhiyaan uske desh kii videsh niti par aadhaarit rahati he
 Although it is true that ambassadors are not independent in its operation
 videsh niti or rajnay ek-duusare ke paryaay nahin hai
 Some scholars use them in place of each other in a bond-free manner
 inamen paryaapt antar he
 Foreign policy involves efforts to protect the interests of nations, establish relations between them and maintain them
 je0aar0 childs ke anusaar “kisi bhi desh kii videsh niti uske vaideshik sambandhon kaa saar he” jabaki “rajnay vah prakriya he jisaki sahaayta se videsh niti karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 "in the words of Sir Charles Waxter," Most of the assumptions of policy are meaningless even if there is no means to convert them into action
 ” yah kaary rajnay karata he The diplomatic relations between the states have been going on since time immemorial
 ye utane hi pracheen hai jitne ki rajya
 In Greece, Rome, and ancient India, diplomatic relations were very extensive, and the rules determining these relations were also formulated
 puraane rajnay kaa arth pracheen kaaleen rajnay se kadaapi nahin he
 This refers to the diplomacy prevalent in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
 richalu dwaara pratipaadit va callears dwaara vyakhyayit rajnay ko, jise puraane rajnay kii sangya di jaati he, saare europe ne sweekaar kiya tha
 This diplomacy ran successfully on the basis of secrecy until the eighteenth century
 1919 ke purv kaa rajnay purana rajnay tha
 The period between the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 and the First World War of 1914 was a golden period of prestigious diplomacy
 yah nishchit niyamon se bandhaa tha
 The diplomacy of this time was based on chivalry, experience and objectivity
 yah vishwaas, spashtataa or yatharth ko safal rajnay kaa aadhaar maanata tha
 The talks were held in secret
 avaagaman va andeh vaahan ke sadhano ke samuchit vikaas ke abhaav main raajaneeyak prakriya kii gati mand thi
 The talks continued slowly
 isamen gatirodh aane par, inhen thode samay ke liye sthagit kar diya jaataa tha, evam anukool samay va paristhiti aane par inhen phir chaalu kar diya jaataa tha
 People did not get any news
 1907 main anglo-rashan kanvension kii vaartaayen pandraa maah tak chalin thi
 The new form of diplomacy that came to us after 1918 was called 'new diplomacy'
 yadhyapi 1919 main rajnay kii sthiti main parivartan aayaa, kintu 1919 kaa varsh vastav main koi vibhaajak rekha nahin he
 According to Nicholson, this has only happened that diplomacy has changed itself according to the new changing circumstances
 jules camban kaa bhi mat tha ki puraane tathaa nae rajnay ke madhya bhed bhram he
 Regala is of the opinion that even though the method of working has changed, modern new diplomacy is still adopting many qualities of old diplomacy
 rajnay ek nirantar gatisheel vyavastha he
 The basis of its ideas and principles today is the experience of hundreds of years
 ve, jinhone puraane rajnay kii katu aalochana kii or nayi vyavastha ko sweekaar kiya, jaisaa raashtrapati vilson ne kiya tha, unhen bhi sheeghra hi puraani vyavastha par phir aana padaa tha
 In this era of open diplomacy, treaty negotiations still operate in secret
 itnaa sab kuch likhane ke baad bhi is baat se nakaara nahin ja saktaa he ki yadhyapi tailoran or bismark tathaa kisinger ke dwaara prayukt rajnay ke sadhano main vibhaajan rekha khinchi ja sakati he, tathaapi rajanyik vichaardhaara main krantikari parirvatan aaye hai
 Today, diplomacy is run by the people and their representatives, not by a few select people, the kings and emperors or their beloved characters
 alag alag desho main rajnay sikhaane ke liye mahavidhyalay khole gaye hai
 Government officials are educated in Mussoorie before they are sent to the International Embassy in India

 "tadvachan" in this Vaisesika Sutra has been interpreted by some scholars as "ishvarakasha"

 However, texts from the Pustapada to the later have accepted the authority of God and some have also presented evidence for its accomplishment
 inke anusaar ishwar nity, sarvajna or purna hai
 God is the driver of the unconscious, the unseen
 ishwar is jagat ke nimittkaaran or parmaanu upadankaaran hai
 Many atoms and many self-immolations are seated with God in the form of continual and free substances; God does not produce them because they are non-origin-destructive because of their continual existence and there is no close relationship with God even to self-righteousness
 ishwar kaa kaary, sarg ke samay, adrusht se gati lekar parmaanuon main aadyaspandan ke rup main sancharit kar dena; or pralay ke samay, is gati kaa avrodh karke waapas adrusht main sankramit kar dena he
 In his Nyayakusumjani, Naayyak Udayanacharya has given the following tips for God-accomplishment- kaaryaat- yah jagat kaary he atah iskaa nimitt kaaran avashya hona chahie
 In the world, harmony and coordination comes from its conscious subject
 atah sarvajna chetan ishwar is jagat ke nimitt kaaran evam praayojak karta hai
 Due to being inertial, atoms cannot have primordial vibrations and atoms without vibrations cannot form duality
 Due to the root, even the invisible cannot transmit atoms in itself
 Therefore, in order to transmit the protoplasm into the atoms and to make them duality, one needs the conscious God
 dhrutyadeh - jis prakaar is jagat kii sristi ke liye chetan srishtikarta aavashyak he, usee prakaar is jagat ko dhaaran karne ke liye evam iskaa pralay main sanhaar karne ke liye chetan dharta evam sanharta kii aavashyaktaa he

 The suffix of the number is related to the conscious observer, at the time of creation, the living beings are located in the root form and the root, the atom, the atom, the time, the mind, etc
 are all roots

 Addritat- is the prey of the good deeds of the unseen creatures
 ye sanchit sanskaar falonmukh hokar jeevon ko karmfal bhoga karaane ke prayojan se sristi ke hetu banate hai
 But the root is invisible, so it needs the direction and direction of the omniscient God
 atah adrusht ke sanchaalak ke rup main sarvajna ishwar kii satta siddh hoti he
 According to Vedantis, the power of God cannot be proved by logic
 As strong arguments can be given in favor of God, as many strong arguments can be given in their opposition as well

 Migration of birds or migration of birds is a very important part of ornithology
 unka yah pravrajan, rituparivartan ke samaan niyamit or kramik hota he or yug-yug se yah manushyon main utsukata or jigyaasa utpann karata rahaa he, yahan tak ki red indianon ne apane kalendar ke maheenon ke naam pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon ke aagaman par hi rakhaa he
 Landborough Tomson, a recognized scholar of the subject of bird migration, has described the migration as follows: bahut purv aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jis prakaar kuch stanpayi or urag sharad ritu main thand se bachane ke liye sheetanishkriyata main chale jate hai, usee bhanti ababil, kalvinkak or koyal bhi shitashayan karti hai
 Such a belief had been prevalent since Aristotle's time
 ushnraktata, pankh or udaan kii adbhut shakti ke kaaran chidiyon main sthanparivartan karne kii kshamta kaa vikaas bahut adhik hua he
 Although birds are more tolerant of both extreme cold or extreme heat than other animals, they are forced to migrate when there is a lack of food in the autumn, otherwise they may die
 pravrajan ke dwaara chidiyon ko do pratikul rituon main bhi do anukool kshetra praapt ho jate hai
 In one region they live and breed and in another region go for food and rest
 yah prakruti kaa vidhaan he ki chidiya pravrajan kshetra ke thande bhaag main hi andey detii hai
 Hence their mating area in the Northern Hemisphere is the Arctic North Pole or temperate zone, but in contrast to the Southern Hemisphere, winter habitat is near the equator
 praaia: pravrajan uttar se dakshin kii ore hota he, yadhyapi kuch pravrajan purv se pashchim kii ore bhi hota he
 Migration ranges from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers, as some birds descend from the higher elevations of the Himalayas to the plains of northern India and some thousands of kilometers to the south
 sabase adhik dur kaa pravrajan uttar dhruviya kurri karti he
 This migration occurs twice every year
 yah arctic ke sheetkaal main dakshin kii ore deshaagaman karti he, sansar ko paar kar dakshin dhruv antarctic main greeshm ritu bitaakar pun: waapas hoti he
 In this way, the journey of one way to and from the journey covers a distance of about 17,742 km
 chidiyon main pravrajan kaa aarambh hone ke sambandh main anek siddhant pratipadit hai
 Sparrows have the following benefits from migration: chidiyon kaa pravrajan pakshi kii ant: or bahya donon hi uttejnaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Experiments reveal that the change in the time period of the external stimuli is prominent; The internal stimulation is produced by hormones produced by the genitals
 pravrajan kaa lakshyasthaan kaise nirdhaarit hota he or chidiyaan is gantavy sthaan kaa rasta kaise maaloom karti hai, inkaa anek prayogon or prekshanon se par bhi abhi tak santoshjanak uttar nahin mil sakaa he
 In the spring, after the autumn, the first return of adult males occurs in the breeding area or summer-dwelling area
 iske baad vayask maadaaen or ant main avyask chidiyaan pahunchati hai
 But in the autumn this sequence is reversed
 pratham avyask pakshi or maadaaen dakshini yatra ke liye prasthaan karti hai or baad main vayask nar
 The journey to the south takes a lot of leisure and stops from place to place
 chote bachche athwa kishor, jinaki umr kuch hi maheenon kii hoti he, kafile kaa pathpradarshan karte hai or vayask baad main unka anusaran karte hai
 How does this happen? There have been many interpretations of this
 unamem se adhik sweekrut mat yah he ki anek pidiyon ke prati varsh pravrajan ke kaaran pakshiyon main anya janmajaat gunon, jaise thik samay par, bina kisi purv anubhav ke, jatiparampara ke anusaar ek vishesh prakaar kaa need nirmaan karnaa he, usee bhanti bina kisi purv anubhav ke pravrajan bhi ek janmajaat gun ho gaya he
 How do birds find the way to remote territories? There are many hypotheses about this, some of which are subtle sensitivity to the magnetism of the Earth, identification by sight of landmarks etc
 kintu purvanubhavvihin kal kii chidiyon main dur gantavy sthaan or uske path ko nirdhaaran ab bhi rahasyamay bana hua he
 Just as a man travels to the faraway and then returns to his home, just as the birds travel thousands of kilometers and spend the autumn in a remote place, not only reach their summer-residence area, but also They also reach the nest
 chidiyon ko challa pehanaane kii vidhi se yah sthapit ho gaya he ki europe main ababil praaia: na keval usee basti main pahunch jaati he, balki usee ghar main jisko chhodkar vah sudur kii yatra par gai thi, pahunch jaati he
 The abbeel covers a distance of 9,677 kilometers in this journey
 yaheen baat anya vaastavik pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon main bhi pai jaati he
 Some known facts published as a result of many years of inspection reveal that the birds not only reach their habitat and old nid, but also return on the exact day they returned in the previous year
 atev jab itani lambii yatra karti hon to ek nishchit samay par lautakar pakshiyon kaa apane ghonsle main upasthit ho janaa or bhi ascharyajanak he
 The position of each autumn bird in the winter in different regions of India varies
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi bhi sthaan ko le len, jaise madhya bharat kaa bhopal kshetra
 Most species of birds, which travel from north or northwest frontier regions in the autumn, to the far south or to Lanka, through that country, go through Bhopal
 in yatriyon main se kuch to peeche rah jate hai or ve sharad ritu bhar bhopal main dekhen ja sakate hai
 We can classify these under the actual autumn, but some remain only for a short time upon the arrival of autumn and do not appear thereafter as they have departed from there to travel further
 ve pun: greeshm ritu ke prarambh main, jab ve uttar kii taraf lautate hote hai, dikhaai padate hai
 They are migrating travelers in autumn and spring
 kuch to sharad ritu main, jab dakshin kii yatra par hote hai, tab to dikhaai padate hai, kintu jab ve vasant main pun: apane nivas kii ore lautate hote hai, tab dikhaai nahin padate, kyonki ve kisi duusare maarg se hokar laut jate hai
 Hence those birds appear in Bhopal in autumn and in spring in some other part
 kuch chidiyaan desh ke andar hi ek bhaag se duusare bhaag main sthanparivartan karti hai, jaise shah bulbul yaa dudhnju, sunaharaa polak or naurang 
 This local migration occurs more in the northern part of the country or in the foothills of the mountains, where seasonal changes are more effective than in the equator
 vaastavik pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon kii bhanti inamen bhi pravrajan kramik or niyamit hota he
 In some parts of the country, some caste arrive in summer, some caste in rain and some caste in autumn
 iske atirikt ek anya prakaar kaa bhi sthanparivartan baraabar hota rahata he, jo aahaar par prabhaav daalanevaali sthaneey paristhitiyon, jaise garmi, sookhaa yaa baadh ityadi, athwa kisi vishesh prakaar ke phool lagane or fal pakane kii ritu, ke kaaran hota he
 At that time sparrows move from one area to another
 kabhi-kabhi asaadhaaran paristhitiyon se baadhya hokar apane upyukt nivasasthaan kii chhodkar bhojan kii talash main chidiyaan kisi anya kshetron main bhi bhraman karti hui pai jaati hai
 Therefore, the population of birds is not constant in any area at any given time, because the arrival and regularization of birds in all the areas is always happening
 himalay ke unche pahaado main rahanevaali chidiyaan jaade main neeche utar aati he or is prakaar tufaani mausam or himrekha se neeche chali aati he
 On the arrival of spring, when the ice begins to thaw and the ice line rises upward, they climb again into the upper reaches of the mountains to lay eggs
 yah kram keval oonchaai main rahanevaale pakshiyon main hi nahin varan neeche rahanevaali chidiyon main bhi chalata rahata he
 In addition to gaining scientific knowledge of sparrows migration, light and inscribed rings of aluminum are worn in the majority of sparrows' feet in Britain and the United States
 yah vidhi america main pakshivalayan athwa pakshipatbandhan kehalaati he
 In addition to the serial number, the address of the place is also mentioned
 chidiyon ko anguthi pahanaakar unka purna vivaran ek pustika main likh kar unhen chhod diya jaataa he
 Now on reaching remote places of these sparrows, their ring is taken off by hitting or trapping them and they are sent to the address from where they flew
 jab kaaphi sankhya main is prakaar kii talika ikatthi ho jaati he tab in talikaon kaa vishleshan karke uske aadhaar par kisi vishesh jati kii chidiya ke pravrajan ke maarg athwa anya kisi samasya kaa hal nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, it has been established with certainty and doubtless as a result of the white buck's burrowing in West Germany and the eastern region that the birds of East Asia travel through the southeastern route to Africa, while the white buck of West Germany The South Western route leads to Africa via Spain
 bikaner main isi prakaar kii anguthidhari chidiyon ke praapt hone se hamen pataa chalaa he ki kuch shwet bak jo hamaare desh main, sharad ritu main, aate hai, ve germany ke hote hai
 In India, this type of advocacy has done very little
 kintu jitna kuch hua he usase praapt suchnaayen bahut hi mahatvapurn or upyogi siddh hui hai
 The speed of migrating birds is different in different birds and this speed depends on many things like wind direction, weather etc
 batakhon or hanson main udaan kii gati 64 se 80 kilometre prati ghante pai gai he or anukool mausam main yah gati 90 se 97 kilometre yaa isse adhik pai gai he
 This speed is 9
5 to 17
7 kilometers per hour in birds flying continuously during the day and night
 nimnlikhit sarini se yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki ek baar kii udaan main koun chidiya kitni duuri tay karti he : The Eastern Golden Titibh flies continuously without stopping anywhere and crosses the open sea of 3226
00 km

 It lays eggs in western Alaska and northeastern Sibiria and regularly tours the Hawaiian Islands

 There are other such birds, which go a long distance without any grain of water
 adhik dur kii yatra karanevaali bhartiya chidiyon main sambhavat: main bhandu teetar he jiskaa andey dene kaa sabase nikatavarti sthaan himalay main hai
 Some pheasants spend part of winter in Nilgiri or other hills in the south and others are not found anywhere
 isse itnaa spasht he ki ye ek udaan main kam se kam 2419
5 kilometre kii duuri avashya hi paar karte hai
 Earlier it was believed that migrating birds fly at very high altitudes, because they have the advantage of determining location, decreasing air flow, etc
 kintu ab yah paaya gaya he ki yadi kisi unchi parvatamala ko paar karnaa nahin hua to vastut: ye pravrajan karanevaali chidiyaan 396
24 meter kii oonchaai par udati hai or birli hi chidiya 914
4 meter kii oonchaai tak kii jaati he
 When the sea has to be crossed or there is no barrier of any kind of tree or mountain, then some birds naturally fly even lower than this
 haan, yadi aavashyaktaa hui to chidiyaan bahut kii adhik oonchaai se bhi ud sakati hai
 There is a mention of flying at altitudes ranging from 3
048 meters to 8229
6000 meters
