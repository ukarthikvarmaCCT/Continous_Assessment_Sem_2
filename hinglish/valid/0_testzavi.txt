 The buds are planted in the same manner as above, but they are not on the ridge but on both of its shields
 yah reeti anya do ritiyon se adhik upaj detii he
 In the rain, the vine is not watered, but after the rain the light land is irrigated three or four times
 jab tak bhoomi belon se puri dhank nahin jaati, tab tak halaki jutai yaa anya ritiyon se khet ko kharpatvaar se saaf rakhana chahie
 The soil is usually climbed twice

 The crop is ready in four to five months, yet the tuber is dug when it grows

 The red castes are generally hoarse, but from the point of view of the land are more powerful or tolerant than other castes

 An American race can be obtained from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi

 If someone can get someone to do something that he would not otherwise do on the basis of his will, it will be termed as power of one person over another
 satta kii yah sahaj lagane vaali paribhaasha robert dahl kii dein he
 It is formulated only with reference to individuals
 jaise hi samooh or samuhikta ke daayre main satta par gaur kiya jaataa he, kai pechida or vivaadaaspad prashn khadey ho jate hai
 It is believed that in the collective context, power refers to decisions that other people are forced to accept
 udhaaharan ke liye, adhyaaapak dwaara kiye gayi nirnay uski kaksha ke chaatr maanate hai or parivaar ke sadsy mata-pita ke faisalon ke aadhaar par chalate hai
 However, this definition of power proves inadequate for matters of politics, economy and socio-policy
 samaaj-vigyaan ke chaatr yah puch sakate hai ki samaaj ke sandarbh main satta kis ke paas rahati he, kiske paas rahani chahie or kis aadhaar par uskaa prayog kiya janaa chahie? in prashnon ke prakaash main aadhunik vichaar ke daayre main satta ke prashn par gaharaai se chintan-manan kiya gaya he
 Among the important questions related to power, the most important is whether power is widely and evenly distributed in society or is concentrated in the hands of a ruling class or a 'power elite'? The question of power becomes more complicated when the equation of power and intention associated with using it is considered
 partiyaan, sarkaar, hit-samooh or bade-bade corporation satta kaa istemaal karte hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 These are examples of deliberate use of power
 par kya yahi baat ek vigyaapak ke liye bhi kahi ja sakati he? uskaa iraadaa to mahaz apane utpaada kii bikri badhanaa he
 So how does the advertisement released by him exercise his power over consumers? Why do consumers succumb to certain types of values under the influence of that advertisement? It is clear that apart from 'intended' forms of power, there are some forms which can be termed as 'structural' forms of power
 steven leukes ne satta ke teen ayaamon kii charchaa karke uske kai pahaluon ko sametane kii koshish kii he
 According to him, power means the ability to hold decision-making power, power means the ability to change the essence of decisions to turn the political agenda in its favor, and power means playing with people's understanding and priorities
 Ability to control their thoughts according to their own
 robert dahl yah nahin maanate ki nirnyon ko prabhavit karne kii kshamta kisi suparibhaashit ‘shaasha abhijan’ yaa ruling class kii mutthi main rahati he
 Published in 1963, his work Who Governments? Dahl presented a study of Connecticut in New Havens, USA
 isamen unhone pehle apane lihaaz se nirnay ke teen pramukh kshetron ko chhaanta, nirnay-prakriya main shaamil logon or unki praathamiktaaon kii shinaakht kii or phir un logon dwaara kiye gayi faisalon kaa unki praathamiktaaon se milan kiya
 Dahl found that financially and politically powerful people tend to make more decisions than ordinary people, but they did not find evidence of a permanent group of relatives making or influencing them
 ve is nattejey par pahunche ki nirnyon ko prabhavit karne main satta kii bhoomika to hoti he, par satta ek nahin balki kai kendron main hoti hai
 Dahm's belief is that if local forms of power are studied in this way, then conclusions can be drawn about its national form
 raajnneetik agenda apane hisaab se banavaane main satta ke istemaal kii shinaakht karnaa thodaa mushkil he
 In this process, the emphasis is less on making decisions and more on preventing others from joining the decisions or expressing a particular opinion
 satta kii is bhoomika ko samajhane ke liye aavashyak he ki sthapit mulyon, raajnneetik mithkon, chalan or sansthaaon ke kaam karne ke tareekon par dhyaan diya jaae
 Through these, the vested interests of one group dominate other groups and in many cases those groups are not even able to get their say or share in decision-making
 aksar yathasthiti ke pairokaar parivartan kii vakaalat karne waalon ko inhen tareekon se haashiye par dhakelte rahete hai
 The processes of liberal-democratic politics are seen by the elites as filters through which radical tendencies are sorted
 satta kaa teesraa cheharaa yani logon ke vichaaron ko niyantrit karke apni baat manwaane kii prakriya logon kii aavashyaktaaon ko apane hisaab se tay karne kii karaamaat par nirbhar he
 Herbert Marquez, in his famous work one-dimensional Man, analyzes why developed industrial societies should also be classified as totalitarian
 marcus ke anusaar hitler ke naji germany main yaa stallin ke rus main satta ke aatank kaa prayog karke sarvasattavadi rajya kaayam kiya gaya tha, par audyogic samaajon main yahi kaam aadhunik praudyogiki ke zariye bina kisi pratyaksh krurta ke logon kii aavashyaktaaon ko badal kar kiya jaataa he
 Conflict in such societies is not visible from above, but it cannot be interpreted in the wide distribution of power
 jis samaaj main vipaksh or pratirodh nahin he, vahaan mana ja saktaa he ki manovaigyanik niyantran or jakadbandi ke baarik hathkandon kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 To consider the concept of power it is necessary to consider its Marxist, post-modern, feminist dimensions and the alternative conception of power propounded by Hanna Arendt
 marxvaadi vidwaan maanate hai ki virgon main bante samaaj main shaasha varg kaa utpaadan ke sadhano par kabza hota he or vah mazdoor varg par apni satta thopata he
 The power of the capitalist class is not only ideological, but also economic and political
 marks kaa vichaar tha ki kisi bhi samaaj main vichaaron, mulyon or aasthaaon ke pradhan rup shaasha varg ke anukool hote hai
 It is their impression on the working class mind that results in the 'confused consciousness' of the workers
 chetana ke isi rup ke kaaran mazdoor apane shoshan kii asaliyat ko pahchaan nahin pate
 That is why there remains a difference between their 'real' interest i
e
 the abolition of capitalist and their 'felt' interest
 lenin kii manyata thi ki poonjeewaadi vichaardhaara kii satta ke kaaran mehanatakash varg zyaada se zyaada keval ‘trade union chetana’ hi praapt kar saktaa he
 That is, he is not able to go beyond improving his living conditions within the ambit of the capitalist system
 mishael phuko ne apane vimarsh main satta or vichaar-pranaaliyon ke bich sutara kii taraf dhyaan khinchaa he
 Fuco sees discourse as a system of social relations and practices that keeps people living within its realm implying its own meaning
 chaahe manochikitsa ho, aushadhi ho, nyaay pranali ho, yaa karagaar, academy anushaasan yaa raajnneetik vichaardhaaraen hon, phuko kii nigaah main ye sabhi vimarsh kii pranaliyaan hai or is naate satta ke rup hai
 According to Fuco, in the modern era, power does not prevent anyone from doing anything, but creates identities and self-beliefs
 satta kaa rajya yaa shaasha varg jaise koi ek centre nahin hota, balki vah usee tarah puri vyavastha main pravaahit hoti rahati he jis tarah sharir main dhamniyon dwaara rakt pravaahit hota he
 This process is controlled through 'governmentality'
 ek vishaal naukarshahi tantra dwaara ananiganat tareeke apana kar logon kaa vargeekaran kiya jaataa he
 Different forms of surveillance are imposed on society, progressively organized and homogenized
 is prakriya main log tarah-tarah kii atmparakataayen jazb kar lete hai
 Through this assimilation, one keeps accepting power in a 'normal' manner
 shaskiyata isi ‘narmalizeshan’ ke madhyam se vyakti ko ‘subject’ main badalati he
 a subject is an expression that means an independent actor and the other is a member of a governed subject
 phuko kaa matlab yah he ki vimarsh ke zariye subject main badalte hi vyakti shaskiyata kii carguzariyon kii maatahati main chalaa jaataa he
 Feminist scholars examine power in the light of the concept of patriarchy
 pitrusatta prabhutv kii ek aisi sarvyaapee sanrachana he jo har str par kaam karti he
 Under patriarchy, a woman can also be in power at the individual level
 lekin use pitrusattatmak shashan dwaara tay kii gayi simaaon main hi kaam karnaa hoga
 For example, in the realm of the home, a woman can be as ruling as a mother-in-law, but not as a daughter, daughter-in-law, wife or sister
 har jagah uski sthiti purush ke saapeksh or uske saath sambandh ke tahat hi paribhaashit hone ke liye majaboor he
 Lonely and isolated there is no identity, and he is cursed to be invisible and deprived of power
 nariwadiyon ke mutabik pitrusatta kii koi aisi samroop sanrachana nahin hoti jo har jagah ek hi rup main milti ho
 According to history, geography and culture, different forms are found
 iske alaava pitrusatta shoshan or prabhutv ke anya roopon ke saath parasparavyapee bhi he
 Everywhere its effects are different
 ek america shwet stri or bhartiya dalit stri ko pitrusatta kaa utpeedan alag-alag dhang se jhelana padataa he
 Hanna Errent is not ready to see power as a structure of dominance alone
 apni rachana ‘whot iz athurity?’ main ve satta ko ek badi hui kshamta ke rup main vyakhyayit karti hai jo samuhik karrwai ke zariye hasil kii jaati he
 When people communicate with each other and take steps together for the sake of a common enterprise, power emerges in that process
 satta kaa yah rup vah aadhaar muhaiyaa karaata he jis par khadey ho kar vyakti naitik uttardaayitv kaa vahan karte hue sakriy hota he

 unka janm 11 june 1965 main mexico main hua
 He was a chubby child since childhood

 His obesity increased mainly after his 1988 visit to the US
 vahaan par unki adhik bhojan karne kii aadat bad gai or isi aadat se unka bhaar aniyantrit rup se badhane lag gaya
 After 1992, his weight started to expand and in the year 2002 he reached such a state that it became difficult for him to get up from bed
 uske baad unhone apni premika cloudia solis se 26 oktober 2008 main vivaah kiya
 He had a desire to go to the marriage himself
 iske liye unhone apana vajan lagbhag 250 kilogram kam bhi kiya lekin bistar se uth nahin paye
 In 2006, he called for help on Mexico's national television channel, which made him a national interest
 iske baad vahaan kii sarkaar ne uribe ke liye vibhinn chikitsak niyukt kiye or unki sahaayta se unhone 2008 tak apana vajan itnaa kam kar liya ki wo duniya ke sabase baari aadmi nahin rahe

 The cause of death was not made public

 The year 638 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he

 alexander graham bel ko puri duniya aamtaur par telephone ke avishkaarak ke rup main hi zyada jaanati he
 Very few people know that Graham Bell has made many more useful inventions not only in telephone, but also in the field of communication technology
 optical-fibre system, photophone, bel or decible unit, metal-detector aadi ke avishkaar kaa shrey bhi unhen hi jaataa he
 All these are based on such technology, without which communication revolution can not be imagined
 graham bel kaa janm scotland ke edinburgh main 3 march san 1847 ko hua tha
 Graham Bell's prodigious talent can be gauged from the fact that he graduated at the age of thirteen
 yah bhi behad aashcharya kii baat he ki ve keval solah saal kii umr main ek behtareen mujeec teacher ke rup main mashhoor ho gaye the
 Disability is nothing less than a curse for anyone, but Graham Bell did not let the disability become a curse
 darasal, graham bel kii maa badhir thim
 Graham Bell was deeply saddened and disappointed by her mother's inability to listen, but never let her disappointment hinder her path to success
 unhone apni niraashaa ko ek sakaaratmak mod dena hi behatar samajha
 This was the reason that he managed to make such an instrument for people unable to listen with the help of sound science, which is still no less than a boon for deaf people
 agar yah kahen ki graham bel ne apana puraa jivan badhir logon ke liye kaary karne main laga diya, to shaayad galat nahin hoga
 His mother was deaf, unable to hear Graham Bell's wife and a special friend of his
 chunki unhone shuru se hi aise logon kii takalif ko kaaphi kareeb se mahasoos kiya tha, isliye unke jivan kii behatari ke liye or kya kiya janaa chahie, ise ve behatar dhang se samaj sakate the
 It is possible that Graham Bell could have succeeded in inventing the telephone because of these special circumstances of his life
 graham bel bachapan se hi dhwani vigyaan main gahari dilchaspee rakhte the, isliye lagbhag 23 saal kii umr main hi unhone ek aisa piano banaaya, jisaki madhur aawaaj kaaphi dur tak suni ja sakati thi
 For some time he was also a teacher in the subject of speech technology
 is dauraan bhi unhone apana prayaas jari rakhaa or ek aise yantra ko banane main safal hue, jo na keval musical nots ko bhejne main sakasham tha, balki articulet spich bhi de saktaa tha
 This was the oldest model of telephone

 unke skool record, na sulajhaa tha anupasthiti or bhavashunya grad dwaara chihnit
 To his father's dismay he sought, while treating other subjects of the school with indifference, his main interest
 , vigyaan, vishesh rup se jeev vigyaan main bane skool chhodane par, bel apane dada, alexander bel ke saath rahane ke liye landan kii yatra kii

 At the age of 16, Bell secured a position as a "student-teacher" of speech and music at Weston House Academy in Elgin, Morey, Scotland
 vah latin or greek main ek chaatr ke rup main namankit kiya gaya tha, vah board ke liye vaapasi or satr pound prati 10 main kakshaen khud ko nirdesh die agle varsh, vah edinburgh vishvavidhyalay main bhaag liya
 Joining his elder brother Melville who was enrolled there last year

 ramesh chandra Sociology is the study of human society
 yah saamaajik vigyaan kii ek shakha he, jo maanviya saamaajik sanrachana or gatividhiyon se sambandhit jaankaree ko parishkrut karne or unka vikaas karne ke liye, anubhavjanya vivechan or vivechanaatmak vishleshan kii vibhinn paddatiyon kaa upyog karata he, aksar jiskaa dhyey saamaajik kalyaan ke anusaran main aise gyaan ko lagu karnaa hota he
 The content of Sociology extends from the microscopic level of face-to-face contact to the broader level of society at large
 samajashaastra, paddati or vishay vastu, donon ke maamle main ek vistrut vishay he
 Traditionally, its focus has been on social stratification, social relations, social interaction, religion, sociology | culture] and divergence, and its approach incorporates both qualitative and quantitative research techniques
 chunki adhikanshtah manushya jo kuch bhi karata he vah saamaajik sanrachana yaa saamaajik gatividhi kii shrenee ke arntagat sateek baithta he, samajashaastra ne apana dhyaan dhire-dhire anya vishyon jaise- chikitsa, sainya or dand sanghathan, jan-sampark or yahaan tak ki vaigyanik gyaan ke nirmaan main saamaajik gatividhiyon kii bhoomika par kendrit kiya he
 The range of social scientific methods has also expanded widely
 20veen shatabdi ke madhya ke bhashaai or saanskrithik parivartanon ne tezi se saamaaj ke adhyayan main bhashya vishyak or vyaakhyaatmak drushtikon ko utpann kiya
 In contrast, recent decades have seen the rise of new mathematically rigorous methods, such as social network analysis
 samajashastreey tark is shabd kii utpatti kii tithi uchit samay se purv kii bataate hai
 The origins of sociology, including economic, political and cultural systems, are proto-sociological in the combined repository of Western knowledge and philosophy
 plato ke samay se hi saamaajik vishleshan kiya janaa shuru ho gaya
 It can be said that the first sociologist was the 14th century North African Arab scholar, Ibn Khaldun, whose first work to bring forward socio-scientific theories of litigation, social unity and social struggle
 shabd "sociologie " pehali baar 1780 main francisi nibandhkaar emenual joseph siyas dwaara ek aprakashit pandulipi main gadha gaya
 It was later founded in 1838 by August Comt
 isse pehle comt ne "saamaajik bhautikee" shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha, lekin baad main vah dusron dwaara apanaaya gaya, vishesh rup se belgium ke sankhyikeevid adolf kotelette
 comt ne saamaajik kshetron kii vaigyanik samaj ke madhyam se itihaas, manovigyaan or arthshaastra ko ekajute karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Writing shortly after the distraction of the French Revolution, he established that social evils can be overcome through social determinism, a philosophical approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy and a General View of Positiveism
 comt ko vishwaas tha ki ek 'pratyakshvaadi str' maanviya samaj ke kram main, dharmik atakalon or aadhyatmik charnon ke baad antim daur ko chihnit karegaa
 Although Comt is often considered the "father of sociology", the subject was formally founded by another structural pragmatic thinker Emil Durkheim, who established the first European Academic Department and later developed positivism
 tab se, saamaajik gyaanavaad, kaary paddatiyaan or poochtacha kaa dayera, mahatvapurn rup se vistrut or apsaarit hua he
 Sociology developed in the 19th century as the educational response to emerging modernism challenges, such as industrialization, urbanization, and scientific restructuring
 europea mahadweep main is vishay ne apana prabhutv jamaaya or vahiin british maanav-shaastra ne saamanyatya ek alag path kaa anusaran kiya
 By the end of the 20th century, many prominent sociologists lived and worked in the Anglo American world
 shastreey saamaajik siddhantkaron main shaamil hai alexis di tokavile, wilfredo parato, karl marks, fredrick angels, ludwig gamploviz, ferdinand toniz, florian jenic, thorstein weblon, harbart spencer, jorge cimail, george herbert mid,, charles kule, varnor sombert, maiks webar, antonio gramsi, gargi ljukas, walter benjamin, theodor dablyoo
 adorno, maiks horkheimer, robert ke
 merton or telkot parcens
vibhinn shaikshanik vishyon main apanaae gaye siddhanton sahit unki kritiyaan arthshaastra, nyaayashastra, manovigyaan or darshan ko prabhavit karti hai
 In the late 20th century and contemporaries Pierre Bourdieu C
 Wright Mills, Ulrish Back, Howard S
 Baker, Jurgen Habermas Daniel Bell, Pitrim Sorokin Seymour Martin Lipset Moise Ostrogorsky Louis Altusar, Nicos Paulantzus, Ralph Miliband, Simone de Bouvar, Peter Berger, Herbert Marcus, Michel Foucault, Alfred Schutz, Marcel Maus, George Ritter, Jean De Boerd, Jean Bouard , Barney Glasser, Anselm Strauss, Dorothy Smith, Irving Goffman, Gilberto Fryer, Julia Cristeva, Ralph d Harendorf, Herbert Gans, Michael Burawoy, Niklas Luhmann, Lucy Irigre, Ernest Gelner, Richard Hogart, Stuart Hall, Raymond Williams, Frederick Jameson, Antonio Negri, Ernest Burgess, Gerhard Lensky, Robert Bellah, Paul Gilroy, John Rex, Jigmant Bowman, Judith Butler, Terry Eagleton, Steve Fuller, Bruno Letter, Barry Wellman, John Thompson, Edward Sade, Herbert Blumer, Bell Hooks, prayek mahatvapurn vyakti ek vishesh saidhantik drushtikon or anusthaapan se sambaddh he
 Durkheim, Marx and Weber are generally cited as the three major founders of sociology; His works can be attributed to the teachings of functionalism, duality theory and non-positivism respectively
 cimelor parcens ko kabhi-kabhaar chauthe "pramukh vyakti" ke rup main shiksha paathyakram main shaamil kiya jaataa he
 In 1890, the subject was first taught under its own name at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, USA
 is paathyakram ko jiskaa sheershak samajashaastra ke tatv tha, pehali baar frank blakemar dwaara padhaayaa gaya
 It is the oldest sociology course to continue in the US
 america ke pratham viksit swatantra vishvavidhyalay, consas vishvavidhyalay main 1891 main itihaas or samajashaastra vibhaag kii sthapana kii gayi

 By Smal, who founded the American Journal of Socialology in 1895
 pratham europea samajashaastra vibhaag kii sthapana 1895 main, l'année Sociologique ke sansthaapak emil durkhim dwaara bordeox vishvavidhyalay main kii gayi
 The first sociology department to be established in the United Kingdom in 1904 was the London School of Economics and Political Science
 1919 main, germany main ek samajashaastra vibhaag kii sthapana ludwig meximilins uniwarsity of munich main maiks webar dwaara or 1920 main poland main florian jenek dwaara kii gai
 International cooperation in sociology began in 1893, when René Worms founded, which was overshadowed by the much larger International Social Union established in 1949
 1905 main, vishwa ke sabase vishaal peshewar samajashastriyon kaa sanghathan, america saamaajik sanghathan kii sthapana hui or 1909 main ferdinand tonies, jorge cimail or maiks webar sahit anya logon dwaara Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie kii sthapana hui
 The systematic approach of early theorists towards sociology was to deal with this subject in the same manner as natural science
 kisi bhi saamaajik daawey yaa nishkarsh ko ek nirvivaad aadhaar pradaan karne hetu or apekshaakrit kam anubhavjanya kshetron se jaise darshan se samajashaastra ko pruthak karne ke liye anubhavvaad or vaigyanik vidhi ko mahatv dene kii talash kii gai
 This approach, called positivism, is based on the assumption that only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge and that such knowledge can only come from positive confirmation of theories, through rigorous scientific and quantitative methods
 emil durkhim saidhantik rup se aadhaarit anubhavjanya anusandhan ke ek bade samarthak the, jo sanrachanaatmak niyamon ko darshane ke liye "saamaajik tathyon" ke bich sambandho ko talash rahe the
 His position was stimulated by his dismissal of "anomie" and his interest in social findings for social reform
 aaj, durkhim kaa vidwata bharaa pratyakshvaad kaa vivaran, atishyokti or ati sarleekaran ke prati asurakshit ho saktaa he: comt hi ekmaatr aisa pramukh saamaajik vichaarak tha jisane daawa kiya ki saamaajik vibhaag bhi kuleen vigyaan ke samaan vaigyanik vishleshan ke antargat aa saktaa he, jabaki durkhim ne adhik vistaar se moulik gyanshastreey simaaon ko sweekruti di
 Reactions against positivism began when the German philosopher Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel voiced against both empiricism, which he dismissed as non-critical and determinism, and which he saw as over-mechanistic
 Karl Marx's methodology was not only derived from Hegel's provincial linguism, but also the exclusion of positivism in favor of critical analysis, seeking to complete the empirical acquisition of "facts" while erasing illusions
 uskaa maananaa rahaa ki anumaanon ko sirf likhane kii bajaay unki samiksha honi chahie
 Despite this, Marx attempted to publish a science of society based on economic determinism of historical materialism
 henrik ricert or wilhem dilthe sahit anya darshanikon ne tark diya ki prakritik duniya, maanav samaaj ke un vishisht pahaluon ke kaaran saamaajik sansarsamaajik vaastaviktaa se bhinn he, jo maanav samskruti ko anupranit karti he
 The first generation of German sociologists at the end of the 20th century formally introduced procedural non-positivism, with the proposition that research should focus on human culture's standards, values, symbols, and subjective perspectives on social processes
 maiks webar ne tark diya ki samajashaastra kii vyakhya halke taur par ek 'vigyaan' ke rup main kii ja sakati he, kyonki yah khaas kar jatil saamaajik ghatana ke adarsh varg athwa kaalpanik sarleekaran ke bich - kaaran-sambandhon ko pahchaanane main sakasham he
 However, as a non-positivist, in contrast to the relationships discovered by natural scientists, a person seeks relationships that are "unhistorical, immutable, or commonplace"
 Ferdinand Tönnis described the two common types of human organizations as the gameshafts and Presented to Gesellschaft
 toniz ne avadharana or saamaajik kriya kii vaastaviktaa ke kshetron ke bich ek spasht rekha khinchi: pehle vaale ke saath hamen swatahsiddh or nigamanaatmak tareeke se vyavhaar karnaa chahie, jabaki duusare se prayogsiddh or ek aagamanaatmak tareeke se

 The current periodic table contains 118 known elements
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 a few months later, German scientist Lothar Meyer also independently created the periodic table
