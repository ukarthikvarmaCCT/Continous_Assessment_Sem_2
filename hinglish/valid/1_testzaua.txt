 In Judaism, Shiva is a period of one week of grief and mourning, consisting of seven first-class relatives: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister and spouse
 
 chunki adhikansh niyamit gatividhiyaan baadhit ho jaati hai, iske kaaran shiva sanskaar kaa paalan karne ko shiva "bithaana" bhi kaha jaataa he
 Shiva is a part of the practice of mourning in Judaism
 swargavaasi vyakti kii antyeshti ke pashchaat pratham shrenee ke rishtedaar haalaaki parampara ke anusaar "eval " kaa darza le lete hai 
 yah sthiti saat din chalati he, jis dauraan parivaar ke sadasyon ko paaramparik rup se ek ghar main ikattha hona hota he or aagantukon se milanaa hota he, haalanki kuch maamalon main jab rishtedaar vibhinn shaharon main rahete hai yaa ek jagah rahanaa asuvidhajanak hota he, tab shiva kai sthanon main kiya ja saktaa he
 At the funeral, mourners usually tear off an outer garment, a process known as keriyah
 yah fata paridhaan shiva ke ant tak pahana jaataa he
 Orthodox Jews wear only a simple garment, while in Orthodox Jews, a small black ribbon piece is attached to the fabric with a pin as an alternative
 hebrew shabd "shiva" arth he "saat" or shiva kii pramanik avadhi saat din kii hi hoti he
 The funeral day is counted as the first day of Shiva, although this process does not begin before mourners reach their places after the funeral
 saatven din shiva aamtaur par subah, prarthana ke pashchaat samaapt hota he, samaaj ke jan matam karne waalon ke saath block main paidal chalate hai
 This action is based on two verses in the book of Isaiah
 shiva ke saptaah ke dauraan shabbat par, koi aupchaarik shok vyakt nahin karata he, lekin yah din saat main se ek ke rup main gina jaataa he
 Occasionally, the Torah reads at the mourner's house
 saat din kii shiva avadhi aamtaur par roodhiwaadee samudaay main paalan kii jaati he
 Although short-term shiva is not accepted in Jewish law and is criticized within the Orthodox community, in many Jewish communities small shiva is practiced, intended to give the mourner some "comfort" in mourning
 is
 kai roodhiwaadee yahudee or kuch sudhaarwadi yahudee saamaanya taur par teen din kii shiva kii avadhi kaa paalan karte dekhe ja rahe hai
 Some reformist Jews have Shiva for only one day
 din kaa yah bhaag antyeshti se laut kar prarambh hota he or usee din baad main samaapt ho jaataa he
 Mourners start their normal lives from the next day
 shiva ke dauraan yadi yom tav, yom kippur, sukkot, passover tathaa shavyot shaamil hai) kaa pratham din padataa he to shiva kaa ant maan liya jaataa he, phir chaahe jitne bhi din use kiya gaya ho

 jan visarjan ke dauraan ke duusare pavitra din bhi antyeshti kii ja sakati he
 In addition, funerals may also be performed on the first day at the hands of non-jews, although this is not usually done
 agar antyeshti chol hamoed par kii jaati he, yom tov ke puraa ho jane tak shiva prarambh nahin kiya jaataa
 jan visarjan ke dauraan, jab adhikansh yom tovim do dinon tak paalan kiye jate hai, duusare din matam nahin kiya jaataa, haalanki yah din phir bhi shiva ke dinon main se ek gina jaataa he
 It is customary for mourners to not eat their food on the first day

 It is customary for mourners to sit on low high stools or on the ground, indicating the emotional truth that they have "come down" because of sorrow
 aamtaur par matam karne vaale shok saptaah ke ant tak kaam par nahin jate
 Many communities have a system in which members of the Chevro Kadisha make arrangements for mourners 'food and visitors' refreshments
 yadi matam vaale ghar main prarthana sevaayen yojit kii jaati hai, matam kar rahaa ek vayask uskaa netritv karata he yadi vah sakasham ho, 
 Going home to a Shiva and meeting mourners is a great mitzvah of generosity and affinity
 paramparaagat rup se aagatuk kisi prakaar kaa abhivadan nahin karte or matam karne vaale hi baatcheet armbh karte hai, yadi ve aisa nahin karte, to aagatuk unke shok kaa aadar karte hue maun hi rahete hai
 Generally speaking, the traditional words of visitor consolation are ha-makom y'nachem et'khem b'tokh shar avelei tzij viirushalayim
 After the conversation starts with mourners, the visitor is expected to talk about the dead person and repeat the things related to his genes
 Some mourners have shared their grief with friends and family in order to divert their attention from their loss to Shiva
 aagantukon ke liye apane ghar se matam karne waalon ke liye taiyaar bhojan laane ko mitzawa mana jaataa he
 Mourners are not expected or expected to present food to visitors, and visitors also accept food only when requested

 jis prakaar se singog main torah padhaa jaataa he, usee prakaar se vah shiva vaale ghar main bhi padhaa jaataa he

 in prarthanaaon main kaddish kaa paath kiya jaataa he; matam karne vaala yadi yogya ho, to kaddish kaa paath kar saktaa he
 The presence in Shiva Minyan is Mitzwa, however, visitors do not have to be deprived of Minyan performed in the Synagogue
 haalanki yah kehane kii saamaanya ashkanaj reet he: Among the Sephardic Jews it is commonly said: donon roopon main, bahuvachan rup / tenachamu) / tenachamu)) kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In the Sephardic community, since there is no need to mention Jerusalem, dialogue is established and mourners reply "uvirushalayim Tenuchamu" shiva main baithe logon par vibhinn pratibandh hai, jo zyaadaatar rabbini rup se anivaary hai or prathagat vichaar se bandhe hai: Other people living in a Shiva house, who are not required to sit in Shiva, are free from these restrictions, but they should respect the person mourning and should not obstruct their weeds and observance of the restrictions
 puure shiva kaal ke dauraan ek fata vastra pahananaa aavashyak hota he 
 haalanki nunatam aavashyaktaa ek vastra faadane kii hoti he, parantu kuch minhaagon ke anusaar 2-3 vastra phaade jate hai
 Although clothes can be torn at any time during Shiva, but it is prohibited to tear clothes before Shabbat, hours before Shabbat and during which the mourner is sleeping
 yadi shiva ke dauraan vah vastra mailaa ho jaataa he to ise aavashyaktaa ke anusaar saafe kiya ja saktaa he, kintu vastron ko saadhaaran taur par saafe kiye jane vaale tareeke se alag tareeke dwaara
 Normally a mourner cannot leave the house where the Shiva period is going on during the Shiva period
 lekin is ghatana ke tamaam apwaad maujuud hai: Usually, no business or other work can be done during Shiva
 But there are exceptions to this: kai saare pratibandh saat dinon ke matam kaal ke baad bhi puure shloshim ke dauraan jari rahete hai or mata-pita kii mrityu ho jane kii avasthaa main kuch aise pratibandh hote hai jo puure varsh tak jari rahete hai
 Most restrictions are customary, so there is no provision of avera if they fail to comply
 lekin laviticas 10:6: ke anusaar kuch pratibandh bible dwaara aadeshit hai However, the person who completely refuses to sit in Shiva as he does not care about his dead relative and leads a normal life even during this period as if nothing has happened
 , In that case, that person violates many orders
 yahi uske liye bhi lagu hota he jo iradatan shiva main baithne se bachane ke liye kisi najdiki rishtedaar kii mrityu kii soochna kii andekhi karata he
 In such a situation when a person is unable to be contacted due to the circumstances, a person is not able to get the information of death of any of his near relatives within a reasonable time and only after being buried, he can get the information of his death
 The day is considered to have started from when the death was reported and also ends when the Shiva of other relatives ends
 ise puraa karne ke liye or dinon tak shiva karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 If one receives the information of his relative's death a week after his burial, he will sit on the shiva from the day of receiving the information, if the Shloshim period has not ended yet
 Shiva will be for a period of seven days, but only at that stage when the Shloshim period is also going on during this period or Yom Tov is starting
 yadi shloshim kaal samaapt ho chukaa he to, shiva kaa paalan nahin kiya jaataa
 lekin yadi mrit vyakti aapke mata yaa pita the to kaddish kaa paath or varsh bhar chalane vaale pratibandh ab bhi prabhavi rahenge
 If no one can be informed of his or her relative's death due to mental illness, an illness that makes that person unable to understand the damage caused by the death, or any physical illness that results from hearing the news In such a situation, this information is withheld and the person concerned does not sit in Shiva
 kuch kattarpanthi yahudee us avasthaa main bhi shiva par baithte hai, jab unka koi sambandhi kisi gaiyr-yahudee se vivaah kar letaa he
 It is possible that the source of such behavior lies in the reading of the dubious statement that Rabbenu Gershom gave when his son converted to Christianity
 !" In the film, when jazz singer Kantor Rabinovich learns that Yasel Rabinovich is in a love affair with a non-jewish boy, he rips off his clothes for Keria and starts teaching Kaddish lessons to mourners

 isi saal main raay ne subhash mukhopadhyaay or anya lekhakon ke saath milakar bacchon kii patrika sandesh ko punerjeevit kiya
 His grandfather started this magazine and Rai had been collecting money for this for a long time

 The magazine was built on this basic idea - education as well as entertainment
 raay sheeghra hi khud patrika main chitra banane lage or bacchon ke liye kahaniyaan or nibandh likhane lage
 In the coming years, writing became his main source of livelihood
 1962 main raay ne kaanchanjangha kaa nirdesan kiya, jisamen pehali baar inhone moulik kathanak par rangeen chhayankan kiya

 Rai laughed once stating that his film's cinematography could be done in any light, but at the same time a commercial film crew in Darjeeling could not shoot a single scene as he had to shoot only in the sun
 1964 main raay ne charulatha film banaai jise bahut se aalochak inaki sabase nishnaat film maanate he

 Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando were cast for its lead roles
 raay ko yah jaanakar aashcharya hua ki unke kathanak ke prakashnadhikaar ko kisi or ne hadap liya tha
 Brando later exited the project and Rai was also disillusioned with the film
 columbia ne 1970 or 80 ke dashakon main kai baar is pariyojna ko punerjeevit karne kaa prayaas kiya lekin baat kabhi aage nahin badi
 Rai has cited a 1980s site and sound format for the project's failure and other details by his official biographer Andrew Robinson in The Inner Eye

 This musical film is based on a story written by his grandfather
 gayak gupi or dholi bagha ko bhuton kaa raja teen vardaan detaa he, jinaki madad se ve do padosi deshon main hone vaale yuddh ko rokte hai
 It was one of Rai's most expensive ventures and capital was very difficult for it
 raay ko aakhirkaar ise rangeen banane kaa vichaar tyaagna padaa
 Rai's next film was Aranyar Dinratri, whose musical structure is considered more complex than Charulata
 isamen chaar aise navayuvakon kii kahani he jo chuttee manaane jangal main jate hai
 In this, Simi Garewal played the role of a wild woman
 aalochak ise bhartiya madhyam varg kii maansikta kii chhavi maanate hai
 After this Rai began to pay attention to contemporary Bengali reality
 bengal main us samay naksalwadi kranti jor pakad rahi thi
 At such a time, he made three films known as the Calcutta Trilogy - Rival, Seemaand and Jan Aranya, about the mentality of the youth
 in teenon filmon kii kalpana alag-alag hui lekin inke vishay saath milakar ek trayee kaa rup lete hai
