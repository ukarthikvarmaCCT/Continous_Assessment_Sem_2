 At the same time a wicked Kancha named Gandharva came there and was distraught when he saw Anupam Lavanavati Manomayi
 kaunch ne rishi-patni kaa haath pakad liya
 The sage wife weeping and trembling started begging him for mercy
 usee samay saubhari rishi aa gaye
 He cursed Gandharva and said, 'you have caught the hand of my fellow mistress like a thief, so you will steal your stomach by stealing more under the earth
 kaanpate hue gandharva ne muni se prarthana kii-'dayaalu muni, avivek ke kaaran maine aapaki patni ke haath kaa sparsh kiya tha
 Please forgive me
 rishi ne kaha meraa shraap vyarth nahin hoga, tathaapi dwapar main maharishi parashar ke yahan ganpati dev gajamukh putr rup main prakat honge tab tu unka dinc naamak vaahan ban jayega, jisase devgan bhi tumhaara sammaan karne lagenge

 vyanjana, shabdashakti kaa ek prakaar he
 Vyanjana has two distinctions - Shabdi Vyajna and Arthi Vyajna
 shabdi vyanjana ke do bhed hote hai- ek abhidhamula or duusari lakshanamula
 The power by which knowledge of misfortune is known is a shabdhana euphemism when the nature of the word Aankartha is controlled by coincidence etc
 yahan 'vanamali' shabd megh or shrikrishna donon kaa bodhak he
 There is a sense of meaning in this as well as another meaning
 dhyaan den ki yahan shlesh nahin
 Because it is predominant in traditional speech
 anya arth kaa abhas-maatr he
 Both meanings of the word are intended in pun - equally the poet is focused on it
 anekarth shabd ke kisi ek hi arth ke saath prasiddh arth bhi hote hai
 like- 'hari' ke surya, singh, vanar aadi anek arth hai; kitu shankh-chakra-yut kehane se yahan vishnu kaa hi gyaan hota he
 The purpose for which the symptom is taken care of is the power by which the purpose is called the symptom, which is called Shabdi Vyaghana
 jo shabdashakti vaktaa, boddhavy, vaakya, anya-sannidhi, vachya, prastaav, desh kaal, cheshtaa aadi kii visheshta ke kaaran vyangyarth kii pratiti karaati he vah aarthi vyanjana kahi jaati he
 The satire communicated by this euphemism makes sense
 arthath kisi shabd-vishesh par avalambit nahin rahata
 For example, in the proposal of the proposition, there is a sense of satire in the speech of the speaker, which is the case, the proposal is a special euphemism
 is padya se yah vyangyarth nikalataa he ki ve kahkar bhi jate to ham unke is punya se kaary main baadhak nahin hoti
 It was not proper for him to go quietly
 yahan prastaav yaa prakaran buddhadev ke grihatyag kaa he
 This satire does not come out of the absence of this proposal
 isi prakaar deshvaishishtyotpannavachyasambhava- main jahaan sthaan kii visheshta ke kaaran vyangyarth prakat ho vahaan yah bhed hota he
 like- yahan ramachandraji ke apane vanvaas ke samay kii sukh-smritiyaan vyanjit hoti hai jo desh-visheshta se hi prakat he
 These different characteristics also inform satire as described
 hindu dharm main ekadshi kaa vrath mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 Every year there are 24 Ekadashis
 jab adhikmas yaa malmaas aata he tab inaki sankhya badhkar 26 ho jaati he
 The Chaturmas, which started on the day of Ashadh Shukla Ekadashi after Dev-sleeping, concludes with the celebration of Devothan on the day of Kartik Shukla Ekadashi

 If possible, keep fast otherwise take only one time fruit
 is ekadshi main raatbhar jagakar hari naam-sankirthan karne se bhagwaan vishnu atyant prasann hote hai
 In the inauguration of the vivahdisamastamlik work, the resolution is made as a witness to Lord Vishnu
 atev chaturmasamen prabhavi pratibandh devotthana ekadshi ke din samaapt ho jane se vivaahadishubh kaary prarambh ho jate hai
 According to the ekadashi-mahatmya described in the Uttarakhand of Padmapuran, observing the fast of Shri hari-prabodhini Ekadashi gives the result of one thousand Ashwamedha Yajna and hundred Rajasuya Yajnas
 is parampunyapradaekadashi ke vidhivat vrath se sab paap bhasma ho jate hai tathaa vrati maranoparant baikuntha jaataa he
 On this Ekadashi, devotees do whatever chanting, meditation, bathing, homage with reverence, it all becomes fruitful
 devotthana ekadshi ke din vratotsvakarna prayek sanatandharmee kaa aadhyatmik kartavya he
 One who performs this fast receives divine fruit
 tugasi, joshimath tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke chamoli jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The wife is a married woman
 patni kaa virudharthi shabd pati hota he
 Wife and wife live a married life together
 grihaswamini hone se gramin bhashaa main ye grihavaali yaa gharwaali bhi kahi jaati he
 The word wife is also mentioned in the Vedas
 riksanhita main nadi naamak vir-patni kaa ullekh kiya gaya he - Ajasi Kulishi Veer-wife Payohinvana Udibhirrante
 
 The wife has been called Grihaswamini in the Vedas - "tvam samraanyayedhi paturastam paryatya" In the house, the wife was given a different house, in which she used to complete her tasks
 atah kaha gaya ki, patninaan sadanam
 That means the wife has a different house
 "patyuh yagne sanyogo yaya" arthath yajna main pati ke saath jisko baithne kaa adhikaar praapt he, vah patni
 With the word "patyurno Yajnasayogaye" from the word Patriya, the word wife is formed when there is negation
 saamanytah purush kii jeevanasathi banane vaali satri ko patni ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 According to Hindu religion, a woman who marries a man to live with him in all his happiness and sorrow in order to spend his whole life and most importantly for the growth of his family, is called his wife

 The eldest brother of Jnanadev had preached from Gahinath of Nath sect of Nivrithinath
 inhone us aadhyatmik dharohar ko gyandev ke dwaara apni choti bahan muktabai tak yathavat pahunchaa diya
 In this way, in the Paramartha Marg, Gyanadev, gratitude and socially wise, wrote a commentary on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita in Marathi with the aim of providing a simple introduction of spirituality to the elites
 isi kaa naam he bhavarthadipika athwa gyaneshwari
 The completion of this scripture took place in the temple of Mahalaya Devi of Saka Samvat 1212 village of Nevasse
 kuch vidwaanon kaa abhimath he- inhone abhang-vrutt kii ek marathi tikaa yogavasishth par bhi likhi thi, par durbhaagya se vah aprapya he
 Almost all the scriptures in those days were in Sanskrit and the general public did not know very much Sanskrit, Asu Tejaswi Balak Dnyaneshwar composed the gita-bhashya named 'dnyaneshwari' in Marathi on Gita only at the age of 15 years
 He preached in his own language as if he opened the bag of knowledge
 swayan tikaakar ne likhaa he- "ab yadi main gita kaa thik-thik vivechan marathi bhashaa main karun to is main aashcharya kaa kya kaaran he 


guru-krupa se kya kuch sambhav nahin ?" After the completion of this book, Dnyaneshwar produced another book called 'amritanubhav', which was an independent investigator of his political principles
 is granth ke purna hone ke baad ye chaaron bhai-bahan pune ke nikatavarti gram alandi aa pahunche
 From here, the letter he wrote in 65 ovis to Yogiraj Changdev is famous in Maharashtra as 'changdev Pasthi'
 gyandev jab tirthayatra ke uddeshy se alandi se chale us samay inke saath inke bhai, bahan, daadi, tathaa visova khechar, gora kumhaar aadi anek samakaleen sant bhi the
 In particular, the relationship between Namdev and Jnanadev was so affectionate that it seemed as if both the knowledge and the deeds had become identical in the disguise of the ascetics in the guise of this pilgrimage
 tirthayatra se lautate hue gyandev pangarpur maarg se alandi aa pahunche
 Scholars speculate that Jnanadeva may have composed his 'abhangas' during this period
 balak se lekar vridhon tak ko bhaktimaarg kaa parichay kara kar bhagwat-dharm kii pun:sthapana karne baad gyandev ne alandi gram main atyant yuva hote hue bhi jivit samadhi lene kaa nishchay kiya
 At the age of just 21 years, three months and five days, he renounced this mortal world and became a tomb
 gyandev ke samadhigrahan kaa vrittant sant namdev ne atyant hridayasparshi shabdon main likhaa he
 After finishing his last prayer to his Guru Nivrithinath, he sat in the Samadhimandir like a wisdom located at Gyanadev
 taduparant swayan guru ne samadhimandir kii dvarshila band kar di
 Dnyaneshwar, also known as Dhyaneshwar, took this living Samadhi in village Alindi Samvat to Margashirsha Vadi Triodashi of Sh 1217, which has now become a famous shrine, about 14 km from Pune
 gyaneshwar ji kii likhi 'gyaneshwari', 'amritanubhav', 'changdev pasthi' tathaa 'abhang' jaisi kai kritiyaan sarvamaanya hai
 a few years ago this theory was presented that the author of Dnyaneshwari and the author of Abhang, are two different persons of the same name
 kintu ab anek pusht aadhaaron se is siddhant kaa khandan hokar yah baat sarvamaanya ho chuki he ki ye rachanaaen hi vyakti sant gyaneshwar / dhyaneshwar kii hi hai
 Dnyaneshwar in his unbroken teachings of ethics to the common people with authority, not measuring the depths of the element of discussion
 fal yah hua ki baalkon se vridhon tak ke man par yah abhangavani purna rup se pratibimbit hui
 Gurukrupa, Namasramana and Satsang These are the three steps of Paramarthpath, which have been originally described by Saint Dnyaneshwar in his teachings
 gyandev jais shreshth sant the vaise hi ve shreshth kavi bhi the
 His spiritual practice is enlivened by poetry, his poetry has received the master-seriousness of philosophy
 yah satya he ki gyaneshwar kii abhangavani 'aap-beeti' jaisi hone ke kaaran usamen jagah jagah ras-strot drushtavy rahe hai, tathaapi unke gyaan kii purnataa gyaneshwari main hi hui he
 Both parts of poetry, rasa and ornamentation have a beautiful coordination in Dnyaneshwari
 tatvavichaar tathaa kavyasaundarya ke samaan hi maharashtra ke parmaarthik jivan main bhi gyaneshwar ne jo kaary kiye ve sabhi krantikari the
 In those days the ritual was dominated, the tradition of the pandits leading the society had become ineffective
 aisi avasthaa main aadhyatm-gyaan kii mahatta sthapit karte hue sarsaadhaaran maanav ke akalan yogya bhaktimaarg kaa pratipaadan gyandev ne kiya
 'dnyaneshwari' was composed keeping spiritual philosophy limited to the texts of the pundits and is easily accessible to the Shudradikas as well
 'neech' samajhe jane vaale kul main janm lene ke kaaran manushya ko saamaajik drushti se kitna hi 'nimna' kyon na mana jaataa ho, parantu ishwar ke yahan sabhi ko samaan aashray miltaa he, is siddhant ko pratipaadit karne kaa shrey gyaneshwar ko he
 His book Dnyaneshwari in Maharashtra is also called 'mauli' or Mother
 duusare upadesh evam aashwaasan ke kaaran us samay maharashtra kii sabhi jatiyon main bhagavadbhakton kii ek peedi hi nirmit ho gai or marathi bhavuk nar-nari apni apni bhashaa main pangarpur ke bhagwaan pandurang yaa vitthal kii mahima gane lage
 God is not only a harsh judge, but also a spontaneous father
 unki drushti main ek mata kii si karunaa he- yah baat sampurna maharashtra main gyaneshwar ne apni saadi-madhur-bhashaa main batalaai
 For this reason, once again the Bhagavata religion was established and 'dnyaneshwari' as the main scripture of this sect also gained prestige among the common people
 isi ke dwaara sphurti praapt kar anek bhagwat kaviyon ne marathi bhashaa main granth-rachana kii or bhakthi-maarg main ek samrudh kavy-parampara kaa nirmaan kiya isiliye gyandev maharashtra-samskruti ke aadya-pravartak maane jane lage

 Neohegelism was clearly born in England in 1865 with the publication of the Hegel mystical treatise by James Hutchinson Sturlig
 sterling ne hegel ko samast maanav chitan vishyon par naveen prakaash pradaan karanevaala ghoshit kiya
 Around the same time, a visionary philosophy journal edited by William Tauri Harris in St Louis in the United States and the Cornford Philosophy and Literature Board declared Hegel to be a new light on all human thought topics
 lagbhag usee samay america main saint lui main wiliam tori haris dwaara sampadit ek pariklpanaatmak darshan patrika ne or cornford darshan evam sahitya mandal ne hegel kaa prachaar aarambh kiya
 He received from Hegel the power to oppose traditionalism in religion and naturalism in science, and in the field of politics, the motivation was that the freedom of the individual was not in arbitrary behavior but in the development of the life of expression in the established state laws

 neo-hegelist philosophers were not entirely ready to be called Hegelists
 visheshtya unamem se kisi ko bhi hegel ke dwandvatmak tarkan kii akritik ruparekha ko apnaanaa sweekaar nahin hua
 Therefore, he tried to interpret Hegelist logic in a new, independent, clearer and more convincing form
 is navvyakhya ke teen mukhya siddhant hai
 One is that what satisfies the intellect is the truth and it is the ultimate existence
 is siddhant ke anusaar satyata astitv main koi antar nahin he
 The purpose of every argument is reality

 But both of these are parts of the same whole and the decision is made about this whole

 According to this, it is realism

 Logic operates between different positions and relationships within this system

 Those physical laws are called the laws of science which are considered universal and which are immutable facts of the physical world
 kintu phir bhi, yadi koi nayaa tathy yaa sakshya miltaa he jo is niyam ke viruddh ho to vigyaan ke niyam asaty siddh ho sakate hai
 "rule" differs from hypothesis, theory, postulate, principal, etc
 in the case that a rule is an analytic statement in which a constant is often obtained by experiment
 kisi siddhanth main kai niyam ho sakate hai yaa vah siddhanth kisi niyam se ingit hota ho saktaa he
 According to a rough estimate, there will be some 18 basic physical laws in the universe

 These basic rules are the result of the homogeneity of space, time and art

 Other less significant laws are the mathematical consequences of the above conservation laws for derivative physical quantities: Chemical laws are those laws of nature relevant to chemistry
 The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the law of conservation of mass, which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary chemical reaction
 Modern physics shows that it is actually energy that is conserved, and that energy and mass are related; a concept which becomes important in nuclear chemistry
 Conservation of energy leads to the important concepts of equilibrium, thermodynamics, and kinetics
 Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass
 Joseph Proust's law of definite composition says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important
 Dalton's law of multiple proportions says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers ; although in many systems the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction
 More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and transformations
 Thermodynamics Quantum mechanics It is thought that the successful integration of Einstein's field equations with the uncertainty principle and Schrödinger equation, something no one has achieved so far with a testable theory, will lead to a theory of quantum gravity, the most basic physical law sought after today

 The process of dividing a group of customers who have a demand for goods separately is called market segmentation or, in simple words, the division made according to the equality of customer demand is called market segmentation
 bhugolic vibhaajananirmaataa bazaar ko bhugolic tarah se vibhajit kar saktaa he jaise raashtra,rajya,jalwaayu,desh,shahar aadi
 Geographical segmentation keeps both demographic and geographic information in order to improve the company's profile
 jaise mausam kaa ham udahaaran le sakate he nirmaataa barish ke mausam main chaataa or barish se surakshit hone yogya vastuain bech saktaa he rajya har rajya kaa rehan sahan alag hota he isliye utpaadak ko bhi unke zarurat ko najar main rakhten hue hi vibhaajan karnaa chahie
 Demographic division is also done in a demographic way like age, occupation, studies, gender etc
, we can take the example of our country of India as we know our country is called the country of youths whose age is between sixteen to sixty
 The segmentation should also be done to the same group of customers so that the producers can reach the maximum number of people
 manovigyaan vibhaajanmanovigyaan vibhaajan graahakon ko is tarah alag karata he jo ek hi tarah kii soch tor tareeke unki ruchi pasand aadi
 Take for example, even in Bangalore city vyavhaar vibhaajanavyavahaar vibhaajan graahakon ke samooh ko kuch is tarah vibhajit karata jisame graahakon kaa vyavhaar companyke prati upyog dar, vafadari str ityadi
 Segmentation by profit is also done according to the benefit of the consumer or the customer, the area, segment or division should be not only to the business but also to the customers because the consumer is making a living in the market if the customers do not benefit
 Had that division not existed for a long time, the companies would not only give the product to the customers at a low price but also to the customers' home
 You can also benefit by transporting it

 Better attention When the manufacturer knows how much and where the demand for his goods is in the market, then he will change his method of manufacturing according to that and will only pay attention to the goods that are in demand
 visheshgyatajab nirmaataa apni vinirmaan vastuo kii maango ke hisaab se banaata he to wo apni vastuain nai takneekon kaa istemaal karke unki khoobiyonko badha saktaa he
 The economical manufacturer only produces products according to the demands of the customers of the divided group, then they can make the goods at an affordable price, so that the customers also get good items at a lower price
 ucchlabhanirmaataa maango ke anusaar apni vastuo utpaadan karata he to wo anya kharche bachaa paata he or un bachat ko wo kai anya jagah main upyog kar saktaa he
 Optimum utilization of resources The manufacturer makes its production according to the demand of the goods, so that raw material is also brought according to the demand, because the raw material is brought according to the demand, so they use them properly
 bazaar vibhaajan ke baad hi lakshya nirdhaaran aata he jab bazaar ko utpaada ke jarurat ke anusaar se vibhajit kar diya jaataa to uske baad hi us graahakon kon lakshith kiya jaataa he is prakriya ko lakshya nirdhaaran kehete he athwa vibhajit samooh ke graahakon ko ek yaa ek se adhik kshatron ke khando main aakarshan or moolyankan se darj karne kii vidhi ko lakshya nirdhaaran kaha jaataa he
 Attraction of section khand kaa aakarshan khand ke aakar sebhi prabhavit hota he jitna bada khand kaa aakaar hoga utana hi zyada samay lagegaa lakshith graahakon tak pahunchane main agar khand chota ho to us khand ke graahakon ko lakshya or pahunchane main kam samay lagata he
 The growth rate of the block also affects the attractiveness of the block as the growth rate increases, the cost of the block would be reduced if the growth rate does not increase then the expenses are increased
 jaise pratiyogita apane khand ranneetiyaan badalata he to companiyon ko bhi usee tarah apni ranneetiyon ko badalanaa chahie
 If customer loyalty is good towards the brand, then the producer does not have to spend much to attract customers in that area
 If the customer loyalty is less to that brand then the producer has to spend more to attract them
 bazaar lakshyon kii naitik vikalplakshya chayan karne ke liye kisi bhi tarah kii anuchit sadhano yaa anautik tareeko ko nahin apnaanaa chahie
 Example: Advertisement in which the description of the product of children is done in such a way that the children claim to be powerful or powerful which can also have a brown effect on the children and the child can also imitate it which can prove to be harmful
 vibhaajan kaa paraspar sabandhajo bhi company apane bikri bal ke liye nishchit laagat rakhti wo apane nirmaan main or utpadonko jod saktaa he jo is nishchit laagat ko kam kar sake
 Can the company's objectives and resources company offer better value to customers in its segment or sector? Affected by the service of the company's image segment, the company can earn more profit if it can serve its segmented market well
 ekal khand ekaagrathaisamen bazaar ko ek hi khand yaa kshetra main vibhajit kiya rahata he isamen sabhi tarah ke utpaada lekar graahakon ko lakshya kiya jaataa he yah khand kifayati he kyonki utpaadak ko alag alag khando par dhyaan dene kii zarurat nahin padati he or wo us khand ke saare graahakon ko sahi se lakshith kar paata he
