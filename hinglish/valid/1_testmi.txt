 For the first time, China is constructing a flat road from Dokola towards Bhutan Army Camp in Zumli

 yuaiee yaa union internationel des associations di'elpinisame, parvatarohan tathaa arohan ke liye vishwa bhar main maanya sanstha he jo parvaton tak jane ke raaston, chikitsa samasyayon, barf par chadhaai, navayuvak arohi tathaa parvat va arohi kii suraksha se jude ahm vishyon par kaam karti he
 It is possible for climbers to walk only in solid snow
 adhik kushal chadhaai ke liye parvatarohi aksar crampon naamak upkaran kaa prayog karte hai
 The crampon is attached to their shoes and consists of 8 to 14 teeth
 ve sakht barf ke liye banaaye jate hai va atirikt karshan pradaan karte hai
 This facilitates very steep climbing and landing
 inaki kismon main halke aluminium model hai jo barf se dhake himandon par chalane ke kaam aate hai tathaa isse ucch str par steel model hai jo sidhi chadhaai va latakati chattan / barf paar karne main upyogi hote hai
 Special snow boots can be used for walking in deep snow
 ski kaa prayog un prayek sthanon par kiya ja saktaa he jahaan himajooton kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or iske atirikt unka prayog sidhe va unche sthanon par bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 However, proper practice is required to ski on difficult routes
 sidhe va unche margon par parvatarohan va skiing kii kalaon kaa ek saath prayog kar chadhaai karnaa or utarana ek prakaar kaa khel he jise ski parvatarohan kehete hai
 To climb the ice slope safely, it is necessary to use the ice ax and various handling techniques developed in the last century for ascending
 sabase kam dhalaan se sabase sidhi chadhaai ke dauraan sabase pehle pair ko oonchai kii disha main uthaaya jaataa he, phir thokar maari jaati he or phir crempon ko aage kiya jaataa he
 In the ice ax mode, he is used first as a hand wrench, then as a peg, then his front part is used as a knife from below and above the shoulder and finally he is used as a knife
 The top is rotated and thrown in the direction of the slope
 ye vibhinn takneekein is baat par nirbhar karti hai ki barf kii kulhadi kaa dizin kaisaa he, tathaa parvatarohi ek kulhadi kaa istemaal kar rahaa he ki do kaa
 barf main rassiyon ke liye lungar ke rup main istemaal kii jane vaali vastuen kabhi-kabhaar avishwasaneey hoti hai; unamem barf kii khunti, aluminium se bane deadman upkaran shaamil hote hai; yaa unhen dabi hui chizon jaise barf kii kulhadi, ski, chattaane evam anya vastuon se bhi banaaya jaataa he
 Anchors can also be formed from hard ice, called bollards
 himand par chalate samay barf kii khaiyaan sabase adhik khatarnaak hoti hai
 These huge cracks in ice are often not seen because a thin layer of ice forms a snowbridge on them
 kai baar yah snobrij keval kuch inch hi mote hote hai
 Climbers use a system of ropes to protect themselves from such dangers
 himand yatra ke liye buniyadi rup main barf kii kulhadi tathaa crempon aavashyak hai
 Teams of two to five climbers are tied equally spaced in a rope
 agar ek parvatarohi girane lagata he to anya sabhi apane sthaan par sthir ho jate hai or sabaki shakti use girane se roak leti he
 Other team members take out the fallen partner from the crack
 jami barf par surakshit yatra ke liye kai vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 If the climb is tough
 parantu utani sidhi nahin, to arohi barf kii keel gaad kar unamem rassi laga kar apni suraksha karata he
 Each ascending climbs using the same nail anchors and takes out the last ascending anchor
 kabhi kabhi bollard yaa himalambon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 This is very useful in that case when all the teams start falling together
 This technique is known as simul-climbing and is sometimes used on steep ice and easy rock
 yadi chadhaai atyant kathin or khadi ho to maanak takanic hi upyukt rahati he
 In this, everyone climbs one by one and after reaching one place, he waits for the follower
 sabhi ke ek jagah ekatrit hone ke baad hi kafila aage badhata he
 Climbers use different shelters depending on the circumstances
 pahaado main mausam bahut apratyaashit ho saktaa he isliye aashray parvatarohi ke liye suraksha kaa bahut mahatvapurn pahalu he
 High mountains may require camping for several days
 "aadhaar shivi" kaa istemaal shikhar par jane ke prayaas ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Base camps are built in places protected from the difficult conditions above
 kai lokapriy yaa khatarnaak pahaado par aadhaar shivi sthit hai
 Where the summit cannot be reached in a single day, more than one base camp is made
 udhaaharan ke liye, everest ke dakshin-purv rij vaale raste main aadhaar shivi ke alawa 4 anya shivi bhi maujuud hai
 There is a network of mountain huts, especially in the European Alpine regions
 france main inhen refuges, italy main rifugi, switzraland main kabanes, germany or austria main hatin, slovenia main coca, spain main refugios, tathaa norge main hitt ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Such huts are present at many different elevations, including high mountains, although more remote shelters exist in more remote areas
 parvatiy jhopadiyaan vibhinn aakaar or kismon kii hoti hai, lekin prayek main aam taur par ek saamaajik bhojan kaksh hota he or unamem gadde, kambal yaa duwaits tathaa takie se las sone kii suvidhaayen hoti hai
 Guests are expected to bring their own beds
 The facilities are usually basic, but in such a difficult environment they provide the most important shelter
 iske atirikt ve margon ko adhik vyapak rup se sulabh banane kaa kaam bhi karti hai kyonki arohi yahan ruk kar yatra main vishram kar pate hai tathaa baari upkaran uthaane se bhi unhen chhutkaaraa mil jaataa he
 Hence, they are considered to be an invaluable place in mountaineering
 europe main sabhi jhopadiyon main garmi ke mausam ke dauraan karmchaaree upasthit rahete hai or kuch main vasant ritu main bhi
 anya sthanon par yah patjhad main bhi jhopadiyaan khuli mil jaati hai
 In some huts a part is always open
 yah maanav rahit hoti hai or inhen winter hat kehete hai
 These huts are run by paid employees when they are open, although some of them are also run by voluntary employees who are members of Alpine clubs such as the Swiss Alpine Club and the Club Alpine Française
 The managers of the hut, called guardians or wardens in Europe, also usually serve refreshments and food
 yah suvidha raat bhar rukne waalon tathaa keval din main rahane vaale, donon ke liye uplabdh hoti he
 Given that most of the items, including water, are often brought by helicopter, the food is quite elaborate
 isamen glucose yukt aahaar, vahin banaayi gayi kek tathaa pastery, bear or sharaab sahit garm or thande peya or raatri bhoj ke liye ucch carbohydrate yukt aahaar sammilit hai
 Not all huts however provide this facility, and some have to make their own arrangements
 udhar kuch jhopadiyaan donon prakaar kii suvidhaayen pradaan karatin hai
 Visitors can use their food items and cooking equipment to keep expenses down, or cooked food is also available for those who spend more
 raat bhar ke liye aarakshan anivaary samajha jaataa he, tathaa kuch lokapriy sthanon par to yah aavashyak bhi hota he kyonki achche mausam yaa saptahanth par 100 bistar vaali suvidhaayen bhi bhar jaati hai! ek baar kiye gaye aarakshan ko radd karwaanaa shisht mana jaataa he, kyonki in jhopadiyon ke karmchaaree bade parishram se har arohi ke raste evam chadhaai ke plan kaa ricard rakhte hai taaki arohi kii suraksha sunishchit kii ja sake
 sab jhopadiyon main telephone dwaara sampark kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sabamein bhugtan ke liye credit card sweekaar kiye jate hai
 In the context of mountaineering, a halt or bivy is a resting or sleeping temporary arrangement, in which the climber gets less than the full facilities of stay, eating and equipment available in the traditional place of camping
 isamen keval ek sleeping bag or padaav kii bori lenaa or sona bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Sometimes small partial shelter areas such as glacial crevices, rock erosions, and snow ditches are used to protect against wind
 in takneekon kaa prayog asal main apatkaal main kiya jaataa tha; yadhyapi jab barfili gufaaon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye samay or upyukt barf sthiti uplabdh na ho, to kuch parvatarohi padaav ke liye vishesh yojana ke rup main lagaataar alpine style kii ore samarpit rahete hai taaki tamboo kaa vajan batch sake
 in padaavon se sambandhit mukhya jokhim, adhik maatra main thand kii chapet main aane kaa rahata he
 Tents are the most commonly used shelters in the mountains
 ye saadhaaran tarplin ke tukdon se lekar atyadhik baari dijin vaale ho sakate hai jo parvat kii dushkar paristhitiyon se bachane main madad karte hai
 In the event of exposure, it may be necessary to place the tent behind snow or rock
 tamboo lagane kaa ek khatra yah he ki tej hawaaen or baari barfabaari khatarnaak ho sakati he or is kaaran se tamboo karaab hokar tut saktaa he
 In addition, the continuous flutter of the tent cloth can disrupt sleep and increase the fear of shelter safety
 ek tamboo kaa chayan karte samay, arohi vishesh parvatarohan tenton par bharosa karte hai jo vishesh rup se tej hawaaon or bhari barfabaari ko jhelane ke liye banaaye jate hai
 Tent pegs can also be pressed into the snow for extra protection
 
 Where conditions are favorable, ice caves are also another way of shelter on the mountain
 kai parvatarohi bahut oonchaai par tab tak tent kaa prayog nahin karte hai jabatak barf kii sthiti barf kii gupha main rahane kii ajna detii he, kyonki barf kii gufaaen tent kii tulana main kaaphi zyada garm or shant hoti hai
 They can be made relatively easily by giving enough time using an ice shovel
 thik tarah se banaai gayi barf kii gupha kaa taapmaana shunya ke aasapaas mandaraata rahegaa, jiske saapeksh bahari taapmaana garm ho saktaa he
 They can be dug in any place where there is at least four feet of snow
 Quinzi is another type of shelter, which is made by reinforcing snow piles
 kuch parvatarohiyon dwaara iglu kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, lekin ise bananaa kathin he or iske liye kuch vishesh barfili paristhitiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Many times in mountaineering, hazards are divided into two categories: objective hazards that are present even when the climber is not present, such as rock fall, avalanche and bad weather, and subjective hazards that are only related to the factors initiated by the climber 
 asaavadhaanee ke kaaran upkaran kii kharabi or tootna, thakaan evam aparyaapt takanic vyaktiparak khatre ke udahaaran hai
 Routes that are constantly changed due to storms and avalanches are considered to have a high level of objective danger, while a technically more difficult route that is relatively safe from these hazards can be considered to be objectively safe
 sankshep main, parvatarohiyon ko in khataron kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie: girti chattaane, girti barf, himaskhalan, parvatarohi kaa girnaa, barfili dhalaanon se girnaa, barfili dhalaanon kaa girnaa, barfili daraaron main girnaa or oonchaai tathaa mausam ke khatre
 in khataron ko kam karne ke liye apane kaushal or anubhav kaa prayog karke ek raste kaa chayan or anusaran karne main hi parvatarohi ke kaushal kii pariksha hoti he
 Each rock is slowly shattered due to erosion, a process that is particularly fast above the ice-line
 chattaanon kaa aakaar pattharon ke girane ke kaaran nirantar parivartit hota rahata he, jis kaaran se dhokhaa ho saktaa he
 Falling rocks form pits on the mountain and these pits have to be climbed very carefully, their edges are often safe while stones fall on the central part
 tazaa mausam ke anusaar chattaane kisi anya chiz kii tulana main zyada girti hai
 Nocturnal snow may temporarily bind the rocks above, but the rising heat or melting of snow during the day can remove these rocks
 aise raaston par girti chattaanon kaa pataa lagane ke liye sthaneey anubhav moolyawaan siddh hote hai
 The direction of the tilt of the rock layer often indicates the severity of the hazard at a specific position; The nature of the rock must also be considered
 Where stone falls frequently, pieces of it will be found below, and falling stones on ice form large pits which are seen from far away
 kisi nae shikhar yaa ek aparichit maarg par chadhane kii yojana banane main parvatarohiyon ko aise nishaanon par vishesh dhyaan dena chahie
 jab girte pathar bahut adhik sankhya main keechaddaar barf yaa pani se milte hai to keechad ke skhalan kaa nirmaan hota he 
 is prakaar kii sambhavit dhalaanon main camping karne se bachanaa chahie
 Locations with a high probability of snow fall can be accurately predicted
 yah himandon ke toote bhaagon main or sakari parvatashrenee ke shikhar par nirmit latakate kinaaron se girti he
 Large icebergs are formed on hard rocks and fall more in good weather withstand cold and stormy days
 girte pattharon kii tarah inase bhi bachanaa zaruri he
 Glaciers form very slowly and reach a state of unstable equilibrium slowly
 They usually fall in the hottest part of the day or shortly thereafter
 ek kushal or anbhavi arohi aamtaur par girti barf ke sabase jatil raste ke bich sabase surakshit maarg kaa chintan karegaa parantu phir bhi garm dinon kii dopaher main aise sthanon se bachanaa chahie
 latakate himand praayah khadi chattaanon par se ek nishchit samyantaral ke baad hat jate hai
 They can always be identified by their debris lying beneath
 inke raste se sadaa bachanaa chahie
 The efficiency of a rock climber is demonstrated by its choice of position and hand, and the skill of holding them after selection
 yah kaaphi had tak us chattan kii kshamta kaa anumaan lagane kii kaabiliyat par nirbhar karata he, jisapar vah khadaa he
 Many weak rocks are strong enough to bear the weight of a person, but experience is needed to know who to trust and skills are required to move the weight without twisting
 kuch kamazor chattaanon par rassi lagaate samay vishesh dhyaan kii zaroorat hoti he, kyonki inase pathar ke neeche girane kii sambhaavna prabal rahati he
 Similarly, proper attention should also be given to them while keeping feet and hands on them
 While crossing the restrictor from quite complex rocks, a dangerous situation may escalate unless both conditions of the restrictor are fixed
 Mutual support has great importance on hard rocks
 do yaa teen arohi ek duusare kii sahaayta se aage badhate hai, athwa duusare dwaara pairon ke liye lagaai gayi barf kii kulhadi par pair rakhkar
 aapasi sahyog kaa sabase pramukh siddhant yah he ki dal ke sabhi sadsy ek duusare kii sahayata se chadhaai karen na ki ek swatantra ikai ke rup main; iname se aage badhate prayek sadsy ko yah pataa hona chahie ki aage or peeche vaala arohi kya kar rahaa he
 a layer of snow is often found on steep rocks after inclement weather, which makes it even more inaccessible
 aisi sthiti main crempon atyant laabhakaari hai
 Avalanche is the lowest risk hazard in the mountains
 log aam taur par yah sochate hai ki ve in khataron ko pahchaanane or isse bachane main sakasham honge
 sachai asal main kaaphi bhinn he
 Every year 120 to 150 people are killed in small icebergs only in the Alps
 inamen adhiktar 20 se 35 kii aayu varg ke anbhavi purush skirs hote hai, lekin isamen ski nirdeshak or guide bhi shaamil hote hai
 There is always danger pressure in crossing the ice plateau
 waapas jane main kaaphi samay or prayaas, behtareen netritv lagata he or sabase mahatvapurn kadaachit himaskhalan hota he jo yah sabit karata he ki sahi nirnay liya gaya tha
 Making the decision to turn becomes even more difficult when other people are crossing the slope as well, but one can become the next person
 himaskhalan ke kai prakaar ke hote hai, lekin do prakaar sabase adhik chintaa ke vishay hai: Hazardous slippery blocks are the place most favored by skiers: tall and wide open, some trees or large rocks, angles of 30 to 45 degrees, just full of fresh snow, big storms Later, on the stormy slope
 Solar radiation can also cause ejaculation
 ye adhiktar bindu relies yaa geela keechad prakaar ke himaskhalan honge
 geeli slide skhalan main judaa vajan shila skhalan kaa chaalu karata he
 Ninety percent of avalanche victims are initiated by them themselves or by other mountaineers of their group
 alpayin raaston par of-pist safar karte samay vaqt dalon ko hameshaa in vastuon ko le jane kii salaah di jaati he
 Avalanche training is also advised to climbers
 vidambnaa yah he ki himaskhalan main hui mauton main sabase pratishat un visheshgy skirs kaa he jinhone himaskhalan prashikshan kiya hota he; shaayad isliye ki ve himaskhalan ke kshetron main ski karnaa zyada pasand karte hon or shaayad isliye kyonki kuch log tej or uyukt muktak banane ke liye apane upkarnon ke saath paryaapt abhyaas nahin karte hai
 Even with the proper rescue equipment and training, one in five is likely to die if trapped in a large avalanche and half are likely to be alive when buried for a few minutes
 iskaa sabase acha samaadhaan yah he ki yah siikhaa jaye ki kis prakaar se jokhim bhari paristithiyon se bachaa jaae
 When traveling on slopes with snow or hard snow, creampons are a standard part of mountaineer's equipment
 jabaki madhyam kone kii barfili dhalaanon par kai baar step-kating kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, phir bhi yah ek dhimi or thakaaoo prakriya he, jo crempons kii ucch suraksha pradaan nahin karti he
 However, in soft ice or powder, crumpons are easily trapped, due to which their effect is reduced
 anya sthiti main, barf kii kulhadi na keval madad karti he balki arohi ko girane yaa phisalane kii sthiti main khud ko samhaalane kii madad bhi karti he
 Yet on a real snowy slope, the ice ax is rarely effective in catching itself
 barf kii dhalaan par khadey rahane ke liye suraksha ke atirikt ehithiyat ke rup main, barf main dabe barf ke pench parvatarohan kii rassi se bandhe hone chahie
 Real icy slopes are rare in Europe, although quite common in tropical regions, where the newly fallen snow melts on the surface soon and flows down, so the next night's cold, the whole fluid converts into a cold-hardened ice cold it happens
 barf kii dhalaane aam hai or inpar chadhaai karnaa bhi aamtaur par asana hota he
 Beneath the slope of the snowpad or ice there is usually a large ice crack, called Bergskrund, where the last slope of the mountain originates from the ice-field or glacier
 aisi barkscrand chalakar paar karne ke liye bahut chaudee hoti hai or inhen barf ke pul se paar karnaa chahie, jiske liye dhynapurvak parikshan or udhyam purvak rassi ke prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a slippery hall of steep snow slopes can be dangerous because the entire portion of its ice can begin as an ejaculation
 yadi aisi dhalaanon par tedha chadhane ke sthaan par sidhaa chadha jaae to ye zyada surakshit hoti he, kyonki tirchhe yaa kshaitij raste inhen kaatane lagate hai or inkaa drav bahna armbh ho jaataa he
 New snow falling on frozen ice is particularly dangerous
 barf kii sandehaaspad sthiti hone par pragati kii saadhyataa kii jaanch kar lene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Snow on the rocks often worsens until it hardens; Ice feels a bit on ice
 ek do din kaa saafe mausam barf ko acchhee sthiti main laa degaa
 barf bahut khadey kone main padi nahin rah sakati he, yadhyapi ankhen isaki dhalaan se dhokhaa kha sakati he
 The snow slope may be inclined to 40 degrees
 sakht jami barf zyada kone tak tik jaati he
 In the morning the snow slopes are hard and safe, but likewise in the afternoon some become soft and dangerous; So there is an advantage in walking quickly
 him daraar ve daraaren yaa gahari khaiyaan hai, jo kisi himand ke padaarthon ke asmaan tal se guzarane par nirmit hoti hai
 They may be open or hidden
 himand ke nichle bhaagon main him daraaren khuli hoti hai
 Above the snow line, they are often hidden by the arched accumulation of winter snow
 chuphi daraaron kaa pataa lagaana badi saavdhaanee or anubhav kaa kaam he
 They can be detected by the sound of an ice ax rod after fresh snow falls, or by looking to the right and left where a partially covered ice crack corner may be open
 durghatana ke khilaaf rassi hi suraksha he or kisi ko bhi kabhi bhi barf se dhakaa himand tabatak paar nahin karnaa chahie jabatak uske paas rassi na ho, yaa phir do saathi ho to or acha he
 Anyone crossing the crevices should also be proficient in protecting from snow cracks
 karaab mausam ke kaaran barf or chattan ki sthitiyon main hone vaale parivartan mukhya rup se khatarnaak hote hai, saamaanya paristithiyon ki tulana main achaanak ghatit hone vaali ye ghatnaye zyada dubhar or hanikaarak hoti hai
 It is difficult to re-locate a path in a white sheet of snow, while rain also prevents the easiest path in dry conditions
 toofaan main keval anubhavyukt paryvekshakon ki tulana main disha ke liye compass kaa prayog karne vaale parvatarohiyon ko zyada laabh hota he
 Of course, in large icy areas, it is more common to go on the wrong track than on a rock, but intelligence and experience are the best aids to escape safely from past threats
 garmi kii aandhi teevr bijli kaa nirmaan bhi kar sakati he
 If climbers are on or near the summit, there is a danger of being killed
 aise kai cese hai, jiname parvat chadhate samay bijli se maare gaye
 In most mountainous regions, localized storms occur after dawn and before dawn
 adhiktar arohi "alpine shuruyaat" lete hai; jo subah se pehle yaa pehali kiran se hota he taaki toofaan kii gatividhi or bijli tej hone par or anya mausami khataron se surakshit rahen
 tej hawaaen hypothermia ke akraman ko baadha saktin hai, saath hi upkarnon ko habi nasht kar sakati hai jaise ki aashray ke liye upyog hone vaala tent
 kuch vishisht sthitiyon main, toofaan jalprapaat kaa nirmaan bhi kar sakate hai, jis kaaran se parvatarohan ki prakriya dhimi yaa band ho sakati he
 The windy winds are a living example of this on the Mount Eijer
 tezi se chadhaai karne se 'atitude sickness' ho sakati he
 The best treatment for this is to come down immediately
 The slogan of ascending at very high is "climb higher, sleep less", which means that the patrons climbed higher to get acclimated but came down to sleep
 In the Andes of South America, coca leaves have traditionally been chewed to avoid acute sickness disease
 atitude sickness ke saamaanya lakshanon main sakht sirdard, sone kii samasya, matlee, bhukh kii kami, susti or badan dard he
 Mountain weakness can increase to hese and hep, both of which can cause death within 24 hours
 oonche parvaton main, vayumandaleey daab kam hota he or is kaaran se saans ke liye oxijan kii kami hoti he
 This is the underlying cause of Attitude Sickness
 har kisi ko abhyast hone kii aavashyaktaa he, yahan tak ki un anbhavi parvatarohiyon ko bhi jo itani oonchaaiyon par pehle bhi chadh chuke hai
 Generally, climbers use bottled artificial oxygen while climbing above 7000 meters
 kuch vishesh parvatarohi oxijan ke bina hi 8000 meter tak kii chotii par chadh jate hai, jiske liye hameshaa abhyaas kaa suniyojit aayojan hota he
 Solar radiation increases significantly in altitude because the atmosphere becomes thinner as it rises, which causes it to absorb less ultraviolet radiation
 barf kaa aavaran vikiran ko paravartit karke baadha saktaa he jis kaaran se dhup main jhulasane or barf ke andhepan kaa khatra 75% tak bad jaataa he
 In 2005, researcher and mountaineer John Sample proved that higher-than-average ozone concentrations in the Tibetan Plateau could pose an additional risk for climbers
 kuch parvat sakriy jwalamukhi hote hai jaise ki sanyojit jwalamukhi jo dweep khandon kii sabase oonchi chotii or andes ke kuch bhaagon main banate hai
 The explosion of these volcanic mountains can pose many hazards, such as lehre, pyroclastic flows, falling rocks, lava flows, large amounts of tephra falling, volcanic eruptions and toxic gases

 Europe and North America, in the middle of Mohimechya style, there is a thunderstorm, due to the many mountain air migration, by carving the pohochu shaktat, te kami, high uneven and tearing, one day and two days
 The differences between the two embarkation styles, and the benefits and dangers are as follows: === Expedition ascension === * Many trips had to be made to carry goods from the lower camps to the upper camps
 Arohan Style Mileage Advantage Matter riskier or both configurations
 * The crew size is also larger due to the need for more supplies between the camps than the Alpine style
 * alpine shailishi tulana kelyas, shibiradarmyaan adhik puravathyachi garaj yamule sanghacha aakaar adhik mothaa asato

 Over a period of time, the knowledge of the emission of alpha rays from radioactive materials was realized and it was found that these rays also attract towards the minuscule

 Hence canal rays and alpha rays were kept in the same class and the rays of this class were called 'dhan Kiran'

 When Siddhartha Gautam was twenty years old, he too joined the membership of Shakyasangh and according to the rules of Shakya Sangha, Siddhartha had spent eight years as a member of Shakya Sangha
 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options
 teen vikalpon main se unhen ek vikalp chunanaa tha sena main bhartee hokar yuddh main bhaag lenaa, apane parivaar ke logon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar or unke kheton kii jabti ke liye raji hona, phaansi par latakana yaa desh nikaala sweekaar karnaa
 He opted for the third option and agreed to leave the country as a transcendent
 parivrajak banakar sarvapratham siddharth ne paanch brahmanon ke saath apane prashnon ke uttar dhundne shuru kiye
 He was able to get proper attention, but he did not get answers to his questions
 fir unhone tapasya karne kii koshish kii
 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he
 To infuse some power into his body, he took some milk from a goat
 ve ek pipal ke ped ke neeche baith gayi pratigya karke ki ve satya jane bina uthenge nahin
 At the age of 35, he attained Bodhi and became a Buddha
 unka pahila dharmopadesh varanasi ke paas sarnath me tha
 For the rest of his 45 years, Gautama Buddha gave his sermon around the river Ganges, to both the rich and the poor
 unhone do sanyaasiyon ke sangh kii bhi sthapana jinhone buddha ke dharmopadesh ko failaana jari rakhaa

 samyak drushti : chaar arya satya main vishwaas karnaa 2
 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3
 samyak vaak : hanikaarak baaten or jhut na bolnaa 4

 The knowledge found from Gautama Buddha is called Bodhi

 Bodhi can be attained only by the perfection of all the parameters, the complete understanding of the four Aryan truths and the prevention of karma
 is samay, lobh, dosha, moh, avidya, trishna or atmaa main vishwaas sab gaayab ho jate he
 There are three levels of Bodhi: ावकravakodhodhi, each Bodhādhi and Samyakasobodhi

 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 sabhi buddha sampradaay tathagat buddha ke mul siddhant hi maanate hai
 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists

 Buddha has told how the creation of the universe in brahma-jala Sutra

e
 the working-sense
 bhagwaan buddha ke anusaar, manushyon ke du:kha or sukh ke liye karm jimmedaar he, ishwar yaa mahabrahma nahi
 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable

 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped

 There was a long-standing demand for medical colleges and universities to stop large-scale rigging at the time of appearing in the medical graduate course
 iske liye kendrikrut pravesh pariksha pranali lagu karne kaa suzav diya ja rahaa tha
 This process was applicable in engineering colleges but due to reluctance of private colleges and state governments, no steps were being taken in this direction
 isse pehle yah pariksha 'eipamti' kehalaati thi
 This examination used to take place all over the country
 is pariksha main aae ankon ke aadhaar par hi chaatro ko kendra sarkaar dwaara sanchalit medical sansthaanon main pravesh diya jaataa tha
 But the government decided to conduct an examination for admission to medical colleges across the country to establish transparency, high standards in medical education and to protect students from the burden of multiple examinations
 neet pravesh pariksha kendriya madhyamik shiksha board yani sibiesai dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It is not hidden that there is competition for admission in medical institutions
 chunki chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai ke baad rojgaar kii us tarah samasya nahin rahati jaise duusare takneekee paathyakramon ke baad rahati he
 Therefore, there is more rush for admission in the course
 chunki nijee sansthaanon main management cote kaa praavdhaan he or daakhile ke liye college khud sharten tay karte hai, isliye vahaan zyaadaatar siton par paise vaale logon ke bachche kabiz ho jate hai
 In these courses, there is a queue of people who give their money

 But due to lack of transparency and practical system in admission, many meritorious students have to be denied admission

 But some states had objected that this may make it difficult to prepare uniform syllabus in regional language and conduct entrance examinations etc
 isi aadhaar par centre ne adhisuchana taiyaar kii thi
 But the legal hurdle was whether the government can bring an ordinance against any decision of the Supreme Court? The President took legal advice on this and finally cleared the ordinance
 is tarah chikitsa sansthaanon main daakhile ke samay cote ko lekar chalane vaali dhaandhlee ruk jaaegi
 So far, the quota prescribed for management, NRI etc
 in private and government colleges, the colleges themselves decide the conditions for admission

 Madhav of Sangamagrama was a famous Kerala mathematician-astronomer, from Erannalakkuta, a town near the Cochin district of Kerala state, India

 He was the first person to develop a series of infinite approximations, which is called "a decisive step beyond the infinite method of ancient mathematics in taking boundary-shifts to infinity"
 unki khoj ne ve raste khol die, jinhen aaj ganitiya vishleshan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Madhavan pioneered the study of infinite series, calculus, trigonometry, geometry and algebra

 Some scholars have also given the idea that Madhava's works have been transmitted to Europe through the Kerala school, by Jesuit missionaries and merchants, who were quite active around the ancient port of Kochi at the time

 Madhava was born as Iannarappilly or Ianninavalli Madhavan Namboodiri
 unhone likhaa tha ki unke ghar kaa naam ek vihaar se sambandhit tha, jahaan "bakulam" naam kaa ek paudha lagaaya tha
 According to Achyuta Pisharati, Bakulam was locally known as "irani"

 Although there is evidence of some mathematical work in Kerala even before Madhava, it is clear from the references that Madhava provided a creative impulse for the development of a rich mathematical tradition in medieval Kerala
 haalanki, madhav ke adhikansh moulik kaary kho chuke hai
 He has been mentioned in the works of his successive mathematicians, especially in Neelkanth Somayaji's Tantra Collection as a proliferation of infinite series comprising several sinθ and arctanθ
 In the sixteenth-century text Mahagyanayana type Madhava has been cited as the source of several series derivatives of π
 jyeshthadev kii yuktibhaasha joki malayalam bhashaa main likhi gayi he, main yah shreniyan 1 / , jahaan x = tan θ aadi, jaise bahupadon ke liye tailor shrenee ke prasar ke rup main pramaanon ke saath prastut kii gayi hai
 Thus, exactly what actions are done by Madhava is a matter of controversy
 yukti-deepika, sambhawatah jyeshthadev ke shishy, sankar variyaar dwaara rachit he, yah sin θ, cos θ or arctan θ ke liye shrenee prasar ke anek praaroop prastut karti he, saath hi saath trigya or vruttkhand kii lambaai ke kuch gunanfal bhi, jiske adhikansh sanskaran yuktibhaasha main bhi dikhaayi padate hai
 That category, which has been argued by Rajagopal and Rangachari, is not widely quoted from the original Sanskrit language, and since some of these categories are attributed to Madhava by Neelkanth, it is likely that some of the other forms are also Madhav
 Can be done in the works of only
 anya logon ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki praarambhik rachana karnapaddati, yaa mahageanyan prakaar sambhawatah madhav dwaara likhit ho sakate hai, lekin isaki sambhaavna bahut kam he
 The Karnapaddhati, as well as Kerala's more ancient mathematics work Sadratnamala and Tantrasangraha and Yuktibhasha, are considered in an article by Charles Matthew Whish of 1834, the first article to draw attention to Newton in his pursuit of fluency

 There are many known astronomers who came before the period of Madhavan, there were also Kutalur Kizhar, Varruki, Sankaranarayana
 Other unknown persons may also have existed in their former times
 However, we have a clear account of the period after Madhavan
 parameshwar namboodiri unke ek pratyaksh shishy the
 According to the palmistry manuscript of a Malayalam commentary of Surya Siddhanta, Neelkanth Somayaji was a disciple of Damodar, the son of Parameswara
 jyeshthadev nilkanth ke shishy the
 Achyuta Pisharati, who was from Trikkantiyur, is also mentioned as a disciple of Jyeshthadeva and Grammarian Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri was a disciple of Achyutha

 yah anant shrenee kii ore vah parivartan hi he, jiske liye madhav ko shrey diya jaataa he
 In Europe, the first such category was developed in 1667 by James Gregory
 shrenee ke sambandh main madhav kaa kaary ullekhneey he, lekin vah baat jo vastav main asaadhaaran he, vah unke dwaara kiya gaya truti pad kaa moolyankan he
 This shows that he had understood the boundary related nature of infinite series very well
 atah, madhav ne hi anant shrenee prasar ke anternihit vichaaron, ghaat shrenee, trikoshmitiya shrenee or anant shrenee ke parimey nikataagaman ke vichaaron kaa avishkaar kiya hoga
 However, as stated above, it is somewhat difficult to determine purely the results given by Madhava and the results given by his predecessors
 neeche un parinaam kaa saransh diya ja rahaa he, jinke liye vibhinn vidwaanon dwaara madhav ko shrey diya gaya he
 Under his numerous contributions, he discovered infinite series for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent and arctangent and also found several methods for calculating the circumference of a circle
 There is a category of Madhava known from the book Yuktibhasha, which includes proof and representation of the power series of inverse tangents, it was discovered by Madhava

 It is believed that he would have obtained this very accurate table based on the following category of spreads: nimnlikhit shloke main madhav ne vrutt kii paridhi or uske vyas kaa sambandh bataaya he jo is shloke main bhootsankhya ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya gaya he- This means- The circumference of a circle of diameter 9 x 1011 will be 2872433388233

 This book credits Madhava itself for several expansions and gives the following infinite series expansions for π, now known as the madhava-leibniz series: jise unhone chaap-sparshajya falan ke ghaat shrenee prasar se praapt kiya tha
 However, the most striking thing is that he also gave a correction term, Rn, for the error that came after the computation up to n terms
 madhav ne Rn ke teen praaroop die the jo nikataagaman ko sanshodhit karte the, isane naam hai Where the third modification results in a very precise calculation of π
 is prakaar ke sanshodhan pad tak kaise pahunche
 The most reliable fact is that they come as the first three convergence of continuous fractions that can themselves be derived from the standard near value of π, 62832 / 2 xxrep 4 0 
 unhone π kii mul anant shrenee ke roopantaran dwaara anant shrenee praapt karke, ek or bhi shighratapurvak abhisaarit hone vaali shrenee di thi By using the first 21 terms to calculate the nearest value of π, he obtained a value that was correct to 11 places in the decimal
 The value of 3

 Madhava also researched other ranges of length of the segment and the nearest value of rational fractions of π related to it, he discovered polynomial diffusion methods, convergence test for infinite series and analyzed infinite continuous fraction numbers
 unhone punrariti dwaara gudh samikarnon kaa bhi hal niklaa or satat bhinn sankhyaon ke dwaara gudh sankhyaon kaa nikatatam maan bhi praapt kiya
 Madhava laid the foundation for the development of calculus, which his successors developed further at the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics
 madhav ne bhi pracheen kaaryon se praapt kuch parinaamon ko aage badhaayaa, jisame bhaskar II ke kaary bhi sammilit the
 In calculus, he used the initial form of differential, integral, and he or his disciples developed the integral of ordinary functions

 "
 According to o'connor and Robertson, a proper evaluation of Madhava would be in the following words
 He took a decisive step towards modern classical analysis

 Although no European translation of these writings exists, it is possible that these ideas may have influenced later European developments in analysis and calculus
 
this was due to not understanding the ideas of the author properly

 Structural engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with the analysis and design of structures to be built to withstand load or resist force
 ise praayah civil ejiniyari ke andar ek visheshgyata kaa kshetra samajha jaataa he
 The job of a structure engineer is often to design buildings and large non-building structures, but they can also be associated with the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles, etc

 According to the theory of statics, due to those forces, the stresses on the various components of the structure also have to be calculated very carefully, so that the structure becomes strong and secure in all respects
 dhaanche ko drudh banane kaa arth uske avyavon ko khub motaa tathaa baari bana dena nahin hota
 The structure of the structure should have the ability to bear the force
 aisa dhaanchaa anke tribhujon ko milakar banaaya jaataa he
 Structures made of quadrilaterals and panchmen do not have this much capability
 trikonyukt dhaanche ko kanchi kehete hai
 It is completely innocent from the point of view of the forces to be tolerated and is self-fulfilling from the point of view of the elements
 aisi kainchiyan kaaphi lambey paaton ke liye banaai ja sakati hai tathaa bhaar padane par swayan santulit bhi rah sakati hai
 Why not work by placing simple concrete type long girder on the walls to make big roof roofs? Why triangular scissors are made? The roofs of moderately small roofs can be made by placing a plain girder of the proper size, but the girder is very heavy and expensive if it is too long
 bade paaton ke liye trikonyukt kainchiyan kaaphi majboot hone ke saath hi bahut halaki or sasti padati hai
 The joints of the scissors are made firm by the ribs not by making pins
 ribaton main kuch vishesh prakaar ke bal adhik aane lagate hai jinhen sahane ke liye in ribaton ko adhik majboot avashya hi banaaya jaataa he
 The weight of the entire roof drop is divided through the lights, coming to the upper joints of the triangles, dividing them evenly on all the scissors, and dividing them half-by-half with the weight of these scissors, finally falling to the base
 at: in bojhon kaa anumaan badi saavdhaanee se kar lenaa hota he
 These burdens always remain the same because they are called immovable loads

 The forces can also be calculated by pure mathematics with the help of statics and trigonometry
 is prakaar se gananaa karne ke liye, kisi upyukt bindu ko dhurnakendre maanate hue, dhaanche ke kisi avyav main padanevaale agyaat bal ke ghurna se samikrut kar dete hai
 The more the number of small triangles are made in it, the greater the scissors of the roof of the roof or the girder of the bridge are anatomized
 yadi kisi lambey khambhe par bhaar daalaa jaae, to ek seemaa se aage chalakar vah khambha bich main se jhukne lagata he
 The same thing is made of small size triangles of appropriate size to withstand force
 yadi kisi lambey khambhe par bhaar daalaa jaae, to ek seemaa se aage chalakar vah khambha bich main se jhukne lagata he
 The same applies to the pauses of scissors
 at: kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikonon main vibhajit kar banaate hai
 The burden that is placed on the structure is called weight
 chal or achal bhaar kaa ullekh upar hua he
 If the weight is concentrated at some place, it is called the concentrated weight and if it is spread over the entire component, it is called divided weight
 railgadee, motor, trek aadi chalane vaale vaahanon ke bhaar ko charbhaar or ek baar ek disha main or turant baad duusari disha se aanevaale bhaar ko prayavarti bhaar or dhamaake ke saath aanevaale bhaar ko sanghaat bhaar kehete hai
 Materials also have a stress
 bhaar kii paristhiti ore pravriti ke kaaran tanan, sampeden, aparupan, anthan aadi pratibal ho saktaa he
 The change that results from the effect of stress is called distortion
 padaarthon main pratyasthata kaa gun hota he, kisi main kam or kisi main kam or kisi main adhik
 There is a limit of elasticity
 seemaa se adhik bal padane par padaarth tut jate hai
 Hooke established a rule in 1676 that if a force was applied to each substance within its range of elasticity, there would be a special ratio between the stress caused by it and the deformation that occurred in that substance
 san 1826 main doctor yang ne pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar padanevaale pratibalon ke kaaran vibhinn padaarthon main honevaali vikrutiyon ke anupaaton kaa nishchayatmak rup se pataa lagaaya
 This is called Young's elasticity modulus
 tanan evam sampeden sambandhi anupaaton ko E, aparupan sambandhi anupaaton ko C, yaa g akshar or aaytan sambandhi anupaaton ko k akshar dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he: Direct elasticity modulus anuprastha pratyasthata mapank The volume of substances is reduced by compression

 Their action lines are also at right angles to each other
 yadi dhure kaa ek chor diwaar main dridhtaa se ksaa hua he or uske duusare chor par anthan bal lagaaya jaataa he, to doosraa chor kuch mud jayega
 The angle, which he turns by making the angle from the radish line, will be his convulsive angle

 Testing of materials used in engineering is essential
 jis paristhiti main samagriyon kaa upyog hota he usee paristhiti main unako rakhkar, unka pareekshan karnaa chahie
 The test takes place in two ways: one has knowledge of the molecular organization of materials and is seen physically by pulling, pressing, shearing, punching, bending and turning to see how they are able to bear
 bhautik reeti se samagriyon kaa pareekshan karne ke liye aajkal ek yantra bana he jise hounfield tensometer kehete hai
 Its methodology is very simple and even a normal person can use it with a little training

 Deformation is very subtle or temporary as long as the stress on a substance remains within the range of elasticity of that substance
 bhaar hatate hi vah padaarth apni mul avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 But if the stress is above the threshold of elasticity, then the deformation is substantial and more permanent
 vibhanjak bhaar pratyasthata kii seemaa se kaaphi adhik hota he, par vyapaarik or upyogita kii drushti se yah bhaar kam hi rakhaa jaataa he or ise paraabhav bindu kehete hai tathaa ise hi vibhanjak bhaar maan liya jaataa he
 The limit of elasticity is planned at the time of design, weighting of much less than the bearable load
 at: yah vyaavhaarik bhaar atyadhik sahane yogya bhaar se jis anupaat main kam ho, us anupaat ko us padaarth kaa abhaya gunank yaa abhayank kehete hai
 It is expressed by the following formula: bhinn bhinn padaarthon ke abhayank vibhinn avasthaaon main vibhinn hote hai
 Hard steel is characterized by three in static load and five to eight in movable load and nine to 13 in alternating moving load

 The diameter of the bullet is usually 10 mm
 And 3,000 kg for iron and steel, 1,000 kg for soft metals like brass etc
 And 50 kg for very soft metal materials like sis etc
 Standard weights are kept
 saadharantaya bhaar itnaa hi rakhaa jaataa he jisase nishaan kaa vyas goli ke vyas ke 3 / 8 se adhik na ho
 The test can be done with a bullet of any diameter, but the ratio of pressure and diameter of the bullet, p / , should remain the same

 All types of components in the structure work are made of rods and plates with various passages of soft steel
 chhadon ke pariched gol, chapate, ytaakar, el, tii athwa ech aadi ke aakaar ke hote hai
 When constructing large scissors in the factory itself, all their components are made by cutting different pieces according to the map and some smaller subdivisions are placed in the factory itself on the flat land and are put in place by the rebates in place; Then by lifting those connected subdivisions by means of cranes etc
, they sit in place and tighten them with bolts

 Dharnas and girders occupy a very important place in structured structures, because on them static, variable and movable loads of flat roofs, bridges, gantries, and overhanging paths etc
 are carried
 jab kisi sidhe avyav ke donon siron ko kisi majboot aadhaar par tikaakar, usapar bhaar ladaa jaataa he, tab vah dharan yaa garder kehalaata he
 By placing the burden on the handle, it can be stretched in the middle and if the burden on it is more than its strength, then its lower surface starts to burst
