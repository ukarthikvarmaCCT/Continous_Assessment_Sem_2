 For example, India's motto is - Satyamev Jayate ] According to Hindu mythology, one of the eight serpents of Takshak Patala, who was the son of Kashyapa and was born from the womb of Kadru, was bitten by King Parikshit to fulfill the curse of Shringi Rishi
 isi kaaran raja janamejay isse bahut bigade or unhone sansar bhar ke saanpon kaa naash karne ke liye sarpyajna aarambh kiya
 Fearing this, Takshak went to Indra's shelter
 isapar janamejay ne apane rishiyon ko ajna di ki indra yadi takshak ko na chode, to use bhi takshak ke saath khinch mangaao or bhasma kar do
 On reading the mantras of the Ritvikas, Indra started pulling with Takshak
 tab indra ne darkar takshak ko chhod diya
 When Takshak pulled and reached near the fire pit, Aastiq came and prayed to Janmejaya and Taksha's life was saved

 garuda puraana main maharishi kashyap or takshak naag ko lekar ek sundar upaakhyaan diya gaya he
 When King Parikshit was going to bite Takshak Nag with a sage curse, then he met Kashyap Rishi on the way
 takshak ne brahman kaa vesh dharkar unase poocha ki ve is tarah utaavali main kahaan ja rahe hai? is par kashyap ne kaha ki takshak naag maharaj parakshit ko dasane vaala he
 i will remove their poisonous effect and give them life again
 yah sunakar takshak ne apana parichay diya or unase laut jane ke liye kaha
 Because no person had survived till today due to his poison
 tab kashyap rishi ne kaha ki ve apni mantra shakti se raaj parakshit kaa vish-prabhaav dur kar denge
 On this, Takshak said that if this is the case, then show this tree green again
 main ise daskar abhi bhasma kiye detaa hum
 Takshak immediately consumed the tree with its poison effect
 is par kashyap rishi ne us vriksh kii bhasma ekatra kii or apana mantra foonka
 Then Takshak saw with surprise that the spring came out of that ash and it turned into a green tree
 hairaan takshak ne rishi se poocha ki ve raja kaa bhala karne kis kaaran se ja rahe hai? rishi ne uttar diya ki unhen vahaan se prachur dhan kii prapti hogi
 On this, Takshak sent him back by giving him more money than he could have expected
 is puraana main kaha gaya he ki kashyap rishi kaa yah prabhaav 'garud puraana' sunne se hi padaa tha

 a relatively more predominant one is representative of the 'type' of personality

 The Sangh believes that Hindutva is the name of a way of life, it is not that those who follow a particular worship method are called Hindus
 har vah vyakti jo bharat ko apni janm-bhoomi maanata he, matra-bhoomi va pitru-bhoomi maanata he tathaa use punya bhoomi bhi maanata he ; hindu he
 The Sangh also believes that if India is secular, it is only because Hindus are in majority here

 These leaders had to struggle a lot to eradicate the untruth propagated by the critics of the prayer community
 asaty prachaar ke antargat yah kaha jaataa tha ki prarthnasmaj isai dharm ke anukaran par aadhrut he or yah desh ke pracheen dharm ke viruddh he
 Following are the main rules and principles of the prayer society: prarthnasmaj kaa uddeshy prarthana or seva dwaara ishwar kii puja karnaa tha
 Like the Brahmasamaja, the teachings of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita are the basis of purpose, but in one thing it is different from the Brahmasamaj, in which the teachings of medieval saints - Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram - of India, especially Maharashtra, have a glorious place

 According to Shahjahanpur Gazetteer, Tilhar was given the present name after Trilok Chandra, a loyal Wachhil Rajput of Akbar
 shahjahanpur to bahut baad main shahjahan ke sipahasalaron bahadur khan or diler khan dwaara basaaya gaya
 It is a matter of fact that due to being named after the Mughal emperor, Shahjahanpur became a district while Tilhar remained a tehsil

 Since Akbar's time, it was earlier called "kaman Nagar" to supply arrows and commands for the Mughal army

 prashulk yaa tarriff, antarrashtriya vyapaar main lagaae jane vaala kar he jo aamtaur par 5% tak hote hai lekin kisi bhi desh dwaara gharelu udyogon athwa utpaadon ke sangrakshan ke liye ise badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The tariff is generally levied on imported goods
 tarriff arthath prashulk, aayaat yaa niryaat par lagaaya jane vaala tex arthath kar he
 Tariffs, generally protectionism, are linked to economic policy limiting trade between countries
 raajnneetik kaarnon se, tarriff, aam taur par aaayaatit maal par lagaaya jaataa he, haalanki niryaatit maal par bhi tarriff lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Compared to nowadays, in the past, tariffs accounted for a much larger share of government revenue
 jab maal se bharaa jahaaj kisi seemaa paar yaa bandargah par pahunchataa he, to seemaa shulk adhikari samagriyon kaa nirikshan karte hai or un samagriyon par tarriff formula arthath prashulk sutara ke anusaar ek tarah kaa kar lagaaya jaataa he
 Since the goods cannot move until the duty has been paid, it is the easiest duty to be collected and the cost of its collection is also less
 tarriff se bachane kii koshish karne vaale vyapaariyon ko smagaller arthath taskaron ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 There are different types of tariffs: ve anuchit sthanantaran keemat kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karte hai jahaan koi company vyapaar kiye jane vaale maal ke mulya kii ghoshnaa karata he jo bazaar keemat se alag hota he jiskaa uddeshy kul shesh karon main katautee karnaa hota he
 In the 20th century, tariffs are determined by a tariff commission based on information received from the government or local authority, or on the spur of industry structure studies
 aadhunik samay main kar, tarriff or vyapaar sambandhi niyamon ko aam taur par audyogic niti, nivesh niti or krishigat niti par unke aam prabhaav kii vajah se ek saath sthapit yaa nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 a trade bloc is a group of allied countries to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other barriers or tariffs imposed on trade with each other and possibly on the goods imported from a country outside that bloc
 Agree to impose tariffs
 seemaa shulk sangh kaa ek aam bahari tarriff hota he or, sahmati sutara ke anusaar, isamen bhaag lene vaale desh is seemaa shulk sangh main pravesh karne vaale maalon par lagaae jane vaale teriffon se praapt rajasav ko aapas main baant lete hai
 If a country's major industries lose out on foreign competition, loss of work and tax revenue can severely distort that country's economy and increase poverty
 agar kisi desh ke jeevanyaapan kaa maanak yaa audyogic niyamon kaaphi ooncha ho to gharelu udyog chote deshon ke saath samjhauta kiye bina unke saath asanrakshit vyapaar ko jivit rakh sakate hai; is samjhaute main neeche kii ek vaishvik daud shaamil he
 Protective tariffs have historically been used as a measure against this possibility
 haalanki, sangrakshnatmak teriffon se nuksaan bhi hota he
 Most notable is that they inhibit the price of goods subject to tariffs by weakening local competition, causing losses to consumers or manufacturers of the goods who use the goods to produce something different: for example, Food tariffs can increase poverty, while tariffs on steel or steel may make automobile manufacturers less competitive
 ve ulti pratikriya bhi kar sakate hai agar tarriff se nuksaan hone vaale vyapaar ko karne vaale desh khud par hi tarriff lagaate hai jiske parinamswaroop vyapaar yuddh shuru ho jaataa he or, mukt vyapaar siddhantkaron ke anusaar, donon pakshon ko nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he
 According to neo-traditional economic principles, tariffs are a harmful interference with the laws of individual freedom and free market
 unka vishwaas he ki sthaneey maangon dwaara aksham kiye gaye kisi udyog kaa kritrim rup se rakrakhaav karnaa upabhoktaaon ke prati anuchit or aam taur par kisi desh ke liye nuksaandaayak he or ve yah bhi maanate hai ki iskaa patan hone kii ijaajat dena behatar he
 The reverse side of all tariffs is part of the free trade principle; The objective of the World Trade Organization is to reduce tariffs and to keep countries away from discrimination between different countries when implementing tariffs
 nimnlikhit graph main ham gharelu arthvyavastha par aayaat tarriff ke prabhaav ko dekhte hai
 In a closed economy with no trade, we will see a balance at the intersection point of the demand and supply curve that yields a $ 70 gain in price and a product of y *
 is maamle main, upabhokta kaa adhishesh A, b or k binduon ke bheetar ke kshetra ke baraabar hoga, jabaki nirmaataa ke adhishesh ko A, b or l kshetra ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he
 While incorporating free international trade into this model, we establish a new supply curve that is reported as SW
 is vakrarekha se ek purvanumaan miltaa he ki maal yaa seva kii antarrashtriya aapurti puri tarah se namya he or yah bhi ki duniya main bataai gai keemat par ek najdiki anant maatra main utpaadan ho saktaa he
 Obviously, in real-world situations, this is somewhat impractical or unrealistic, but making such predictions is unlikely to have any material impact on the model's outcome
 is maamle main maal kii antarrashtriya keemat 50 dollar he 
 The above model is completely accurate only in extreme situations where none belongs to the consumer group and the cost of the product is a fraction of their salary
 agar iske bajaay, ham vipareet charam sthiti ko lete hai or maan lete hai ki sabhi upabhokta nirmaataa samooh se sambandhit hai or yah bhi maan lete hai ki unki ekmaatr kharidari shakti vetan se sambandhit he jo utpaadan ke rup main praapt hota he or utpaada kii laagat unka puraa vetan he, to graph ekadam alag dikhaai detaa he
 Without tariffs, only producers or manufacturers / consumers capable of producing the product at world price would have enough money to buy it at that price
 chote exl trikon ko kharidne main abhi bhi samarth upabhoktaaon ke ek samaan chote darpan chhavi trikon se milan kiya jayega
 tarriff ke saath, ek bada sidiel trikon or uskaa darpan batch paaegaa
 Also note that there is no incentive to buy imported goods over domestic, with tariffs or without tariffs, as each has the same price
 keval rin ke madhyam se, parisampattiyon ko bechakar, yaa nai tarah kii gharelu utpaadan se nae vetan ke madhyam se uplabdh kharidne kii shakti main pherbadal karke aaayaatit maal ko karidaa jayega
 yaa, jaahir he, agar isaki keemat keval mazdooree yaa vetan kaa ek ansh ho
 In the real world, as more imported goods replace domestic goods, they consume a much larger fraction of the available domestic salaries, leading the graph to move towards this approach of the model
 agar utpaadan ke nae tareeke samay par na mili, to desh diwalia ho jayega or aatanrik raajnneetik dabaav ke falswaroop rin kaa bhugtan nahin ho paaegaa, bahut zyada tarriff lagegaa, yaa usase bhi badtar haalat ho jaaegi
 The establishment of tariffs slows down this process, allowing more time for new types of production to develop, but it also strengthens industries that may never regain competitive pricing
 tarriff ko ek swatantra raashtra kii sthapana karne ke liye ek raajnneetik upkaran ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america kaa tarriff act of 1789 arthath prashulk adhinium 1789, jis par vishesh rup se 4 july ko hastakshar kiya gaya tha, ko akhbaaron ne "second dikaleyareshan of independence" arthath 'swatantraaa kii duusari ghoshnaa' kaha kyonki iskaa makasad saarvbhaumik or swatantra sanyukt rajya america ke raajnneetik lakshya kii prapti ke liye ek aarthik saadhan bananaa tha
 In modern times, the political impact of tariffs is seen in a positive and negative sense
 2002 united stats steel tarriff arthath 2002 kaa sanyukt rajya america ispaat prashulk ne teen varshon kii ek avadhi tak vibhinn prakaar ke aaayaatit steel utpaadon par 30% kaa tarriff lagaaya
 america steel utpaadakon ne tarriff kaa samarthan kiya, lekin kaato institute ne is kadam kii aalochana kii
 Tariffs can sometimes emerge as a political issue before an election
 2007 australian sangheey chunaav kii taiyaari main, australian lebar party ne ghoshnaa kii ki nirvaachit hone par yah australian car teriffon kii samiksha karegi
 The Liberal Party made a similar commitment, while independent applicant Nick Xenophon announced his intention to establish tariff-based legislation as "a matter of urgency"

 Gulliver's Travels is a novel written by an anglo-irish writer and pastor Jonathan Swift
 yah maanav ke swabhaav par to vyangy karata hi he, saath hi apane aap main "yatriyon kii kahaniyon" kii ek up-saahitiyik style kii parody bhi he
 It is Swift's known, long work and is a classic novel in English literature
 yah kitaab prakashit kiye jane ke turant baad kaaphi lokapriy ho gayi, ; tab se, isaki chapai kaa kaam kabhi bhi nahin rukaa
 The book presents itself as a descriptive description of the ordinary traveler, with an unskilled title Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, with its authorship identified only as "lemuel Gulliver, who is first a surgeon and then Many ships have captains
 " paathya ko kaalpanik lekhak ke dwaara ek pratham-purush ke rup main prastut kiya gaya he or naam "guliver" sheershak prishth ke alaava puri kitaab main kahin nahin miltaa he
 All publications of the text begin with a fictitious letter
 jiskaa sheershak he "da publisher tu da reader" or "a letters from capton guliver tu hiss kazin simpasan" jo is tathy ko prastut karata he ki mul khate main sampadan kiya gaya he or ise lemmul guliver kii anumati ke bina prakashit kiya gaya he
 The finished book is then, divided into four parts, which are as follows
 4 may 1699 - 13 april 1702 The book begins with a very short preface in which Gulliver, in the style of the then books, gives a brief outline of his life and tells the history before his travels
 unhen yatra main bahut majaa aata he, haalanki yatraaon ko pasand karne ke kaaran hi unka patan hota he
 In his first voyage, Gulliver sinks with a ship and finds himself in captivity when he regains consciousness
 jin logon ne unhen bandhak banaaya he unka aakaar saamaanya maanav ke aakaar se baarah guna kam he, unki unchai 6 inch se bhi kam he, ve padausi or virdohi deshon lilliput or blefusku ke nivasee hai
 After assurances of good behavior, they are given a place to stay in Lilliput and become a favorite of the court
 yaheen se, pustak main guliver ke dwaara lilliput kii darbar kaa prekshan shuru ho jaataa he
 Gulliver helps the people of Lilliput steal their neighboring neighborhood of Belfuscu
 jisase lilliput ke log blefusku ke logon par kabja kar lete hai
 However, he refuses to merge this country into the province of Lilliput, which is not liked by the king and the court
 Gulliver is charged with treason and sentenced to be blinded
 ek dayaalu mitra kii madad se, guliver batch kar blefusku chalaa jaataa he, jahaan use ek parityakt naav milti he, is naav par savaar hokar kisi tarah vah ek guzarate hue jahaaj tak pahunch jaataa he jo use surakshit rup se uske ghar panhucha detaa he
 The building that Gulliver was given to live in Lilliput is very important, because in this section he describes it as a temple, which had a murder a few years back, and so the building was abandoned
 i jaati he
 With the help of a kind friend, Gulliver escapes to Blefuscu, where he finds an abandoned boat, aboard the boat and somehow reaches a passing ship that safely reaches him
 lilliput main rahane ke liye guliver ko jo imaarat di gayi, vah bahut mahatvapurn he, kyonki is khand main ve iskaa varnan ek mandir ke rup main karte hai, jisamen kuch saal pehle ek hatya hui thi or isliye is imaarat ko chhod diya gaya tha
 20 June 1702 - 3 June 1706 jab aage badhata hua jahaaj adventure toofaan ke kaaran apane raste se bhatak jaataa he or taaze pani kii khoj main ise majabuuran bhoomi kii taraf janaa padataa he
 That's when Gulliver's companions leave Gulliver, now he finds a farmer who is 72 feet tall) He brings Gulliver to his home and takes care of his daughter Gulliver
 kisaan uske saath jigyasapurna vyavhaar karata he or use dhan detaa he
 This spreads and the Queen of Brobdingnag wants to see him
 guliver ko pasand karne lagati he or use kharid kar apane darbar main ek pasandida darbari ke rup main rakh leti he
 Since Gulliver's size is very small, chairs, beds, knives, forks, etc
 are too large for her, the queen orders a small house for Gulliver to live in
 is box ko uske yatra box ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 Meanwhile, he performs small, exciting tasks such as fighting a giant skirmish and reaching the roof by a monkey
 He discusses the situation in Europe with the king
 guliver ke dwaara kiye gaye europe ke is vivaran se raja prabhavit nahin hota he, vishesh rup se banduukon or topon ke upyog kii shiksha se
 samundar kii ek yatra main, uskaa "yatra box" ek vishaal chil ke dwaara pakad liya jaataa he
 The eagle leaves Gulliver and his box in the middle of the sea, where he is captured by some sailors and taken to England
 5 agast 1706 - 16 april 1710 When Gulliver's ship was attacked by pirates, he was left alone near India, a desolate rocky island
 saubhaahgya se laputa ke ek udaan dweep ke dwaara use bachaa liya gaya, laputa ek aisa samrajya tha, jo ganit or sangeet kii kalaon ke prati samarpit tha parantu vyaavhaarik rup se in kalaon kaa upyog nahin kar paaya
 Laputa's method of throwing rocks at the rebellious city also started from here, this aerial bombardment was adopted as a method of warfare
 haalanki yahaan par, vah ek kam ranking ke darbari ke atithi ke rup main desh kaa daura karata he or paata he ki vyaavhaarik parinaamon kii parvaah kiye bina vigyaan ke andhadhundh prayog kiye ja rahen hai jo barbaadi kaa kaaran ban rahen hai or shahi samaaj or iske prayogon par vyangy hai
 Now Gulliver is brought to Balnibarby to wait for a Dutch businessman, who may take him to Japan
 is intazaar ke dauraan, guliver globedbarib ke dweep par choti se yatra kar letaa he, yahaan vah ek jaadugar ke yahaan jaataa he or aitihaasik logon ke bhuton ke bare main charchaa karata he, yah pustak main "pracheen banaam aadhunik" kaa sabase spasht vivaran he
 In Lagnag she encounters Sterledbrug, who is unfortunately immortal, but not always young
 Instead they always remain old
 unamem boodhi aayu kii sabhi aakshamataayen bhi hoti hai or kanoonee taur par unhen 80 varsh kii umr main mrit maan liya jaataa he
 After arriving in Japan, Gulliver asks the Emperor for permission to "stop the process of hanging my countrymen on the cross and then stop the celebrations", the Emperor allows
 guliver apane ghar laut aata he or ab vah faisla letaa he ki apana baaki jivan yaheen par bitaayega
 7 September 1710 - 2 July 1715 apane ghar main rahane kaa iraadaa kar lene ke baavjood, guliver ek vyapaarik captain ke rup main phir se samudr main laut aata he, kyonki ki vah sarjan ke rup main kaam karte karte ub gaya he
 During this journey, he is forced to make some changes in his crew, but he feels that these changes will turn the rest of the crew against him
 Now the pirates revolt begins and these bandits keep him with them for some time and then leave him in the first calm land area
 khud daaku bane rahete hai
 He is released into a landing boat and now finds some deformed creatures that make him disgusted
 iske kuch hi samay baad use ek ghoda miltaa he or use samaj main aata he ki ghode shaasha hai or vikrut praani aadhaar rup main manushya hai
 Gulliver becomes a member of the horse-house and praises the Hohuinms, imitating their way of life, rejecting humans as Yahoo, because they all have a tendency to further promote their natural faults
 Get
 haalanki, ek sabha main nirnay liya jaataa he ki guliver main yahuu ke jaisi kuch jhalak he, vah unki sabhyataa ke liye khatara he or use nishkasit kar diya jaataa he
 Now he is rescued by a Portuguese ship against his will and he is surprised to see that Pedro de Mendez, the captain of this ship, is a yahoo and he is a wise, gentle and generous man
 vah england main apane ghar laut aata he, lekin vah apane aap ko yahuu ke bich rahane main asamarth paata he or vairaagi ban jaataa he, apane ghar main rahete hue bhi vah apane parivaar or apni patni se bachane lagata he or ek din ke kai ghante apane astabal main ghodon se baat kar bitaane lagata he
 It is uncertain when Swift began writing Gulliver's Travels, but according to some sources it began in 1713 when Swift, Gay, Pope, Arbuthnot and a few others formed the Scribblers Club to satirize the then popular literary formations
 
 swift kaa siddhant club ke kaalpanik lekhak, martins scribleras kii yaadon ke lekhan se prerit he
 Swift's correspondence suggests that its composition began in 1720, with mirror-related parts i and II written first, followed by Part IV in 1723 and Part III in 1724, but in that Revisions were also made at the time when Swift Drapiers was writing letters
 agast 1725 tak pustak puri ho gayi thi or chunki gulivers travels paardarshee rup se wig-ke pratikul vyangy thi, is baat kii sambhaavna he ki swift ne pandulipi kaa upyog kiya, taaki unki lekhnee ko ek pramaan ke rup main kaam main naa liya ja sake yadi koi unke viruddh kanoonee karrwai karata he
 
 In March 1726, Swift went to London for publication of his work; His manuscript was secretly given to publisher Benjamin Mottay, who employed five printing houses to speed up production and prevent piracy
 motta ko lagata tha ki isaki bikri sabase zyada hogi, lekin unhen dar tha ki iske viruddh kanoonee karrwai kii ja sakati he, isliye unhone sabase bure hamalavar tathyon ko kaat diya or pustak II main rani ene ke paksh main kuch saamagree ko joda or kisi tarah se iskaa prakaashan kiya
 The first version was released in two volumes on 26 October 1726, priced at 8s
 6d
 was
 is pustak ne sansani machaa di or iske pehle hisse ko ek saptaah se bhi kam samay main bech diya gaya
 Motté published Gulliver's Travels anonymously, followed by the production of several successors, parodies, and "keys" over the next few years
 inamen se adhikansh ko gumnaam rup main prakashit kiya gaya tha or jaldi hi bhula diya gaya
 Swift did not include any of these in his book, and he specifically refused to include them in Faulkner's edition of 1735
 haalanki, swift ke mitra alexander pope ne gulivers travels par paanch sanskarnon kaa ek samucchy likhaa, jise swift ne itnaa pasand kiya ki unhone inhen pustak ke duusare sanskaran main shaamil kar liya, haalanki unhen vartmaan main aamtaur par shaamil nahin kiya jaataa he
 In 1735, George Faulkner, an Irish publisher, printed the entire set of Swift's work so far, Volume III was Gulliver's Travels
 jaisaa ki falconar ke "edvertisement tu da reader" main prakat hota he, falconar ko motta ke kaam kii ek vyaakhyaatmak pratilipi "lekhak ke ek mitra" ke madhyam se uplabdh ho gayi thi jisane hastlipi ke adhikansh hisse ko motta ke sanshodhano se mukt rakhaa, mul hastlipi ko nasht kar diya gaya
 It is also believed that Swift had at least reviewed the proof of Faulkner's version before printing, but this cannot be attested
 In general, it is known as the editio precepts of Gulliver's Travels, with one exception, which is described below
 is sanskaran main ek hisse ko swift ke dwaara shaamil kiya gaya, a letters from captin guliver tu hiss kagin simpasan 
 isamen mul paathya main motta ke dwaara parivartan karne kii shikaayat kii gayi, isamen kaha gaya ki unhone ise itnaa zyada badal diya he ki "mujhe yah meraa kaam hi nahin lag rahaa he" or bich ke varshon main prastut kiye gaye motta ke sabhi parivartan, kees, galat kathan, parody, doosraa hissaa or iske aage kiye gaye kaam ko nakaar diya gaya
 This paper is now part of many standard texts
 laputa ke udaan dweep ke khilaaf lindalino ke satahi shahar ke vidroh ko bataane vaala, bhaag III kaa chota episod, dreprs letters ke liye spasht rup se anyoktiparak tha, jis par swift ko garv tha
 Lindalino represented Dublin and the imposition of Laputa represented William Wood's British imposition of copper currency of poor quality
 falconar ne is padya ko hataa diya, aisa yaa to isliye kiya gaya ki ek british virdohi vyangy kaa ek irish prakaashak ke dwaara mudran kiye jane ke kaaran rajnatik samvedansheeltaa kii sthiti utpann hui
 Or perhaps the reason was that the text he worked on did not include this verse
 1899 main is padya ko sangrahit kaaryon ke ek nae sanskaran main shaamil kiya gaya
 The modern version is a derivative of Faulkner's version, incorporating the 1899 modifications
 da anotated guliver main ijak asimov likhte hai ki lindalino dabl lines se bana he; isliye dublin kehalaata he
 Gulliver's Travels has been given many designations, from Menipian satire to children's story, from proto-science fiction to the forerunner of the modern novel
 dengul defo kii atyadhik safal robinson cruso ke saat saal baad prakashit, gulivers travels ko defo kii maanav kii ashaavadi kshamta ke vyavasthit khandan ke rup main padhaa ja saktaa he
 In Unethinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Men, Warren Montag argues that Swift pointed out that the person is the portrayal of society
 jaisaa ki defo ke upanyaas main darshaya gaya he
 Swift views this thinking as the dangerous radicalism of Thomas Hobbes's political philosophy, and therefore Gulliver repeatedly portrays established communities rather than isolated islands
 vah captain jo teesri vinaashkari yatra main guliver ko apane jahaaj par sarjan kaa kaam karne ke liye aamantrit karata he, uskaa naam robinson he
 Perhaps one of the reasons for the classic status of this book is that it can be seen as many things to many different people
 mote taur par, is pustak main teen vishay hai: Its parts follow a pattern in the story of the story and the composition: khud guliver kaa charitra bhi utana hi ruchikar he- vah pehle bhaag main ek khushmijaaz ashaavadi vyakti he or kitaab ke ant tak ek aadambarpurn manushyadrohi ban jaataa he
 We have to understand the essence of this work if we believe that it is the last traitor who has written the entire book
 is arth main guliver travels ek bahut hi jatil or aadhunik upanyaas he
 There are subtle changes throughout the book, such as when Gulliver begins to understand not only Yahuhnam as Yahoo, but all humans, pustak kii sookshmata or gaharaai ke baavjood, ise aksar bacchon ke kahaniyon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Because the liliput section of the book makes it popular among children
 guliver travels sheershak ke saath kitaab ke keval us hisse ko bhi kharida ja saktaa he, jisamen keval lilliput kii yatra kaa hi varnan he
 From 1738 to 1746, Edward Cave published semi-fictional issues of contemporary debate in topical editions of The Gentleman's Magazine in the two Houses of Parliament with the title Debate in the Senate of Lilliput
 is bahes main vaktaaon ke naam, anya ullekh gaye vyakti, tatkaaleen or ateet ke raajnneetijna or samraat, adhikansh anya deshon or europe or america ke shaharon ko swift ke kai prakaar ke chhadmanaamon ke saath alag alag roopon main prastut kiya gaya he
 The changed names and phrases were actually translations of Lilliput's politicians' speeches, a reaction to the parliamentary activity in which its debate issues were denied publication
 kev ne is shrinkhalaa main kai lekhakon ko shaamil kiya: wiliam guthrie, semul jonson or jon hoxworth 
 Gulliver's popularity became so high that the word "lilliputian" entered many languages as an adjective meaning "small and delicate"
 yahaan tak kii lilliput naamak ek chote cigar kaa brands bhi he
 In addition to this there is also a series of several specimen houses known as "lilliput Lane"

 In Dutch, the term "liliputur" is used for adults smaller than 1

 The first of these was the Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput, published in 1727, which is an extension of the episode Gulliver lived in Lilliput and Blefuscu
 isamen lilliput ke darbar main nindaatmak episods ke bare main kai latife jod die gaye hai
 Gulliver's son goes through a variety of fantastic, satirical adventures

 The second, Capilaria, is a satirical commentary on male-female relationships

 ellison fail kaa upanyaas "da mistress of lilliput" bhi kuch isi prakaar kaa he: jisamen meri guliver khud yatra par chali jaati he
 It satirizes the practices of current society, such as sports, television, politics, etc
 parody ke auchity ko spasht karne ke liye kahani ko swift ke dwaara likhit antim yatra ke thik baad set kiya gaya he or puri kahani main mul kaary kii saahitiyik style ko banaaye rakhaa gaya he
 They only speak dialogue from the original book
 guliver lekhak kii kalpana main ek aisi upaj ke rup main he jise padhaa ja saktaa he
 However, a deeper meaning can be derived depending on the reader's discretion

 As the title suggests, only Gulliver's journey is depicted, but construction within this range is very faithful to Swift

 The action continues to flashback around his journey, where he is telling the story of his journey and is committed to making some changes

 Were responsible for, attempting to move judges
 18 march, 1981 ko, kanoon mantri ke rup main shivashankar ne sabhi rajyon ke governron or mukhyamantriyon ko ek paripatr ko sambodhit kiya taaki ve atirikt nyaayadhishon se praapt ho saken 


 unke samjhaute ko kisi bhi ucch nyaayalay main sthanantarit kiya ja sake
 The reasons mentioned in the circular were that such a policy of relocation would help in combating narrow and narrow tendencies such as national integration, caste, relations, and other local views
 lekin paripatr ko nyaaypalika main avishvaas kii abhivyakti or asuvidhajanak nyaayadhishon ko dandit karne ke liye ek upkaran ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 Granville Austin, in its Executive a Democratic Constitution: The Indian Experience, said of the circular: "it threw kerosene on the current fire when it became public knowledge in mid-april that the circular asked recipients to file in the state's High Court Appointment of additional judges as permanent judges in any other High Court Mr

 He seemed to confirm that he had sent the circular without consulting YY Chandrachud, the then Chief Justice of India
 uske baad kya hua itihaas he
 On December 30, 1981, a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court gave its decision in SP Gupta v
 Union of India, in which the court held that Shiv Shankar's circular was not unconstitutional, as it had no legal power in the first place
 apni pustak main, austin is avadhi ke dauraan shivashankar kii vibhinn dharanaon ko sanderbhit karata he
 One school of thought believed that he intended to curtail judicial independence, and he carefully avoided defending the appointment of judges irrelevant to the then Prime Minister, Mrs Gandhi
 raay ke ek or nikaay, austin nots ne kaha ki unka paripatr sarkaar ke paksh main nyaayadhishon ko dhamkee dene ke liye iraadaa nahin tha
 While considering the government's interest, Shiv Shankar was not unlike the judges being partially cautious, but his main motivation seems to be engaged in class and caste consciousness
 jaisaa ki austin ne kaha: "unke liye, nyaayadhish buddhijiviyon yaa brahman the, yaa nai majboot aarthik jatiyon or virgon se- anya pichhadaa virgon ke upree bhaag - jinke ekadhikaar ko todaa janaa tha 'ki obisi or anusuchit jati or janajatiyon ke nimna ranking sadsy vakaalat ke rup main 'badhotaree' kar sakate hai or bench main apana rasta khoj sakate hai
 Austin said that Shiv Shankar believed that the Chief Justices of the High Courts showed caste preferences in choosing co-workers and deciding cases, and transfers could be better because outside judges do not have local roots
 austin bhi ek vyaktigat tatv record karata he jisane shivashankar ko prerit kiya

 Shiv Shankar is dying, at a time when the appointment and appointment of judges in the High Courts, a major issue between the Center and the Supreme Court Collegium, is a sad reminder of how the struggle for priority between the executive and the judiciary Started in the 1980s, and continues to this day

 The history of Uttarakhand is legendary
 uttrakhand kaa shabdic arth uttari bhu bhaag kaa roopaantar he
 This name is mentioned in the early Hindu texts, where it is mentioned as Kedarkhand and Manaskhand
 uttrakhand pracheen puranic shabd bhi he jo himalay ke madhya failaav ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa tha
 Uttarakhand is also known as "dev Bhoomi" because this entire region is the playground of religious and divine beings and the key and mysterious essence of the origin and glories of Hinduism
 paurav, kushaan, gupt, katyuri, raayak, paal, chand, parmaar va payaal rajvansh or angrezon ne baari-baari se yahan shashan kiya tha
 Although according to the British historians, the Huns, Shakas, Nagas, Khashs etc
 also resided in the Himalayan region, but in the mythological texts and history, the area is widely known as Kedarkhand and Manaskhand
 is kshetra ko dev-bhoomi va tapobhumi mana gaya he
 The names of Kurmanchal and Kumaon of Manaskhand became popular during the reign of Chand kings
 kurmaanchal par chand raajaaon kaa shashan katyuriyon ke baad prarambh hokar san 1790 tak rahaa
 In 1790, the Gorkha army of Nepal invaded Kumaon and subjugated the Kumaon kingdom
 gorkhaon kaa kumaanun par san 1790 se 1815 tak shashan rahaa
 After the last defeat of the British in 1815, the Gorkha army returned to Nepal, but the British did not give the rule of Kumaon to the Chand kings and made the Kumaon under the East India Company
 is prakaar kumaanun par angrejo kaa shashan 1815 se prarambh hua
 According to historical accounts, Kedar division was divided into several strongholds
 in gadhon ke alag raja the or raajaaon kaa apane-apane aadhipaty vaale kshetra par samrajya tha
 According to historians, the king of the Panwar dynasty subordinated these Garhos to establish a unified Garhwal kingdom and made Srinagar their capital
 kedarkhand kaa gadhwal naam tabhi prachlit hua
 In 1803, the Gorkha army of Nepal invaded Garhwal state and took over Garhwal state
 maharaja gadhwal ne nepal kii gorkha sena ke adhipaty se rajya ko mukt karaane ke liye angrajo se sahaayta maangi
 The British army finally defeated the Gorkha army of Nepal near Dehradun in 1815
 kintu gadhwal ke tatkaaleen maharaja dwaara yuddh vyay kii nirdhaarit dhanrashi kaa bhugtan karne main asamarthta vyakt karne ke kaaran angrajo ne sampoorn gadhwal rajya gadhwal ko na soup kar alakananda mandakini ke purv kaa bhaag east india company ke shashan main shaamil kar gadhwal ke maharaja ko keval tehri jile kaa bhu-bhaag vaapis kiya
 Sudarshan Shah, the then Maharaja of Garhwal, established his capital on 28 December 1815 at a place called Tehri which was a small village at the confluence of Bhagirathi and Milangana
 kuch varshon ke uparant unke uttaradhikari maharaja narendra shah ne orathali naamak sthaan par narendra nagar naam se duusari rajdhani sthapit kii
 From 1815, Dehradun and Paudi Garhwal came under the British and Tehri Garhwal came under Maharaja Tehri
 katyuri raja vir dev ke pashchaat katuriyon ke samrajya kaa purna vibhaajan ho gaya tathaa yah na keval apni jati ke apitu kuch bahari kabeelon ke bhi adheen bat gaya
 a large part of Garhwal passed out from the hands of Katyuris and the remaining Kumaon region was divided into six tribes
 tatpashchaat katuris samrajya ko nepali raajaaon ahokchala tathaa karachala dev ne apane rajya main mila liya
 Both these attacks proved decisive due to mutual enmity between different tribes
 tatpashchaat sampurna samrajya 64 athwa kuch maton ke anusaar 52 gadhon main vibhajit ho gaya
 The chieftains of all these strongholds often quarreled among themselves
 solahavi shatabdi ke prarambh main kanak paal ke vanshaj ajay paal ne jo kii chandpur gadhi kabeelon kaa sardaar tha, sampoorn gadhwal ko ek kar diya
 The copper plates of Pandukeshwar indicate that the capital of this barrage was located in the Karthikeyapura niti-mana valley and later in the Katyur valley
 atkinshan ne kabul kii ghati se is vanshaj kii utpatti kaa pataa lagaaya tathaa unakon kaatoron se joda
 According to Garoula and Nautiyal, the Katyuri was a small Khasa tribe who originally lived in Joshimath north of Garhwal and later migrated to the Katyur valley of Kumaon
 katuriyon ne pauravon or tibeti hamalaavaron ke patan ke baad apni takat badhaai tathaa 7 veen shatabdi ke ant or 8 veen shatabdi ke armbh main ve swatantra ho gaye
 In ancient Hindu texts, Kumaon was called Manaskhand

 He was followed by the commissioners of Batten, Baffett, Henry, Ramsay, Colonel Fisher, Combat, Pau, this division and he undertook land reforms, settlements, taxes, post and telegraph department, public health, law enforcement and dissemination of regional languages etc

 In a few decades, Garhwal gained a very important place in India and made its mark as the land of the brave castes
 landsdowne naamak sthaan par gadhwal sainikon kii 'gadhwal rifles' ke naam se do regiments sthapit kii gayi
 Undoubtedly, modern education and awareness helped Garhwalis to contribute greatly to the mainstream of India

 After independence, Garhwal became a district of Uttar Pradesh in 1947 and in 2001, Uttarakhand became a district

 The name 'rajpur' has also been mentioned on many ancient copper plates
 ek puranic katha ke anisaar daksh prajapati kii putree uma kaa vivaah shiv se hua tha
 Daksha Prajapati did not like Shiva, but he could not defer the requests of the gods, so he did not want his daughter to marry Shiva
 ek baar daksh prajapati ne sabhi devataaon ko apane yahan yajna main bulaayaa, parantu apane damaad shiv or beti uma ko nimantran tak nahin diya
 Uma stubbornly reached this yagna
 jab usne haridwar sthit canarvan main apane pita ke yajna main sabhi devataaon kaa sammaan or apane pati or apni niraadar hote hue dekha to vah atyant du:khee ho gayi
 In the Havan Kund of the yagna, she jumped and said, "I will make Shiva my husband in the next life too
" apane meraa or mere pati kaa jo niraadar kiya iske pratifal - swarup yajna ke havan - kund main syvan jalakar aapke yajna ko asafal karti hoon
 'when Shiva came to know that Uma became Sati, his anger was no longer in the cross
 unhone apane ganon ke dwaara daksh prajapati ke yajna ko nasht - bhrasht kar daalaa
 All the Gods and Gods, seeing this insurmountable form of Shiva, started thinking that Shiva should not be destroyed
 isliye devi - devataaon ne mahadev shiv se prarthana kii or unke krodh ko shant kiya
 Daksha Prajapati also apologized
 shiv ne unako bhi aashirwad diya
 However, upon seeing Sati's burnt body, his quietness swelled
 unhone sati ke jaale hue sharir ko kandhe par daalkar akaash - bhraman karnaa shuru kar diya
 In such a situation, wherever the parts of the body fall, there the power returned
 jahaan par sati ke nayan gire the ; vahiin par nainadevi ke rup main uma arthath nanda devi kaa bhavy sthaan ho gaya
 Today's Nainital is the place where the Nain of that goddess fell
 nayanon kii ashrudhar ne yahan par taal kaa rup le liya
 Ever since then, Shivapathi Nanda is worshiped here as Nainadevi
 yahaan ke nikat ek gaanv main machhlee evam ghongho ke jeevashm paye gayi hai jisase ingit hota he ki pithauragarh kaa kshetra himalay ke nirmaan se pehle ek vishaal jhil rahaa hoga
 Until recently, Pithoragarh has been ruled by the Khas dynasty, who are credited with building forts or coats here
 pithauragarh ke aasapaasd chaar coten hai jo bhatkot, duungarkot, udaikot tathaa oonchakot hai
 After the Khas dynasty, the Kachudi dynasty ruled here and the king of this dynasty was Ashok Malla, a contemporary of Balban
 isi avadhi main raja pithora dwaara pithauragarh sthapit kiya gaya tathaa isi ke naam par pithauragarh naam bhi padaa
 Three kings of this dynasty ruled from Pithoragarh itself and the brick fort built by them in the nearby village of Khakot was demolished by the then Collector of Pithoragarh in the year 1560
 varsh 1622 se aage pithauragarh par chand vansh kaa aadhipaty rahaa
 There is another controversial description of the history of Pithoragarh
 atkins ke anusaar, chand vansh ke ek samant piru gosai ne pithauragarh kii sthapana kii
 It seems that during the reign of King Bharti Chand of the Chand dynasty, his son Ratna Chand defeated King Doti of Nepal and took control of the Solar Valley and in 1449 merged it with Kumaon or Kurmanchal
