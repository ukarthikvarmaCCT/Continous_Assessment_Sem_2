 The Directive Principles of State Policy are the latest elements of democratic constitutional development
 sarvapratham ye ireland ke samvidhan me lagu kiye gayi the
 These are the elements which have developed with the development of the Constitution
 in tatwon kaa kaary ek janakalyankari rajya kii sthapana karnaa he
 The Directive Principles of State Policy have been incorporated from Articles 36 to 51 of the Constitution of India

 rajya ke niti nirdeshak tattvon kaa uddeshy samuhik rup se bharat main aarthik evam saamaajik loktantr kii rachana karnaa tathaa kalyankari rajya kii sthapana karnaa hai
 According to Article 37, these elements cannot be applied in any court, these elements are not legal and have political form and only have moral rights
 ve na to koi vaidhanik baadhyataa hi rajya pe lagu karte he na janata hetu adhikaar kartavya
 They are just such general instructions for the state that the state should do such things which will be beneficial for the people of the state
 in nirdeshon kaa paalan karypalika kii niti tathaa vidhayika kii vidhiyaan se ho saktaa he
 In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that the elements were essentially subordinate to the fundamental rights
 Chamar Durai Rajan suit would not give priority to fundamental rights in case of a dispute, but when the state legislature started the abolition of zamindari
 In order to give effect to the Directive Principles of Article 39B, the Supreme Court recognized the importance of these elements and in Kameshwar Singh Vs
 From 1952 till 1957, the Supreme Court accepted that the Directive Principles of Policy cannot prevail on Fundamental Rights, but later the Court laid down the Harmony Principle and tried for collaborative development and tried to make both of them more effective
 As much as was possible
 hormoni siddhant dono ke madhya koi sangharsh nahi maan kar dono ko ek duusare kaa poorak maanata he
 According to this theory, if two interpretations are possible that balance the Directive Principles with the Fundamental Right, the second interpretation should be disputed in them, then the court should give priority to the first interpretation over the second interpretation if only one interpretation is possible and which policy - If there is a conflict between the rights, then the court is bound to abolish the 'privy purse' and give priority to the rights over the policy directors
 The Nationalization Act, which was brought for the compliance of Article 39 'B' and 'S', was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court for violation of fundamental rights, Parliament passed the 25th Amendment 1971 in response to this and Article 31 Gave birth to s which states that if a law is passed which gives effect to the Directive Principles of 39 b and in this process if paragraph 14, 19, anu 31 sa ke anusaar koi vidhi jo anu 39 ba sa ko prabhavi karti he kisi bhi nyaayalay me parakshit nahi kii ja sakegi
 This amendment was challenged in the Keshavanand Bharti suit

 This amendment was challenged in Minerva Mill vs Union of India suit in 1980, in which the Supreme Court declared the new amendment to Article 31 non-constitutional as it distorted the balance of parts 3 and 4 of the Constitution
 44 ve sanshodhan 1978 ne anu 31 kaa hi vilopan kar diya
 The present situation is that two directive elements 39B, c can be applied by giving preference to two fundamental authorities 14, 19

 The emergence of stars is discussed in the main article: Origin of stars
 taarakeey vikaas ek vishaal aanvik badal ) ke rup main shuru hota he jise taarakeey nursery bhi kehete hai
 There is actually 0
1 to 1 particle per cm3 of space inside most of the 'empty space' of a galaxy, but the typical density inside a GMC is a few million particles per cm3
 ek jiemasi main hamaare surya kii tulana main 50 se 300 prakaash varsh ke baraabar adhik dravyaman hota he jo ki aakaar ke aadhaar par 1,00,000 se 1,00,00,000 guna adhik he
 The temperature of very small dwarf stars is never so high that it is desired to start molecular fusion of hydrogen; These stars with a solar mass of 0
1 are called brown dwarfs or brown dwarfs
 brihaspati ke dravyaman se 13 guna adhik m j { \ displaystyle M_{J}} baari bhure boune dutirium kaa sanlayan karte hai or kuch khagolvid kisi grah se adhik bade lekin ek up-grah se choti vastu ke rup main inhen vargeekrut karke keval in vastuon ko brown dwarf kahana pasand karte hai
 Both types of wires that are not ignited or ignited by deuterium tend to fade and die off slowly, freezing over hundreds or millions of years
 haalanki isse adhik baari boune taron kaa kendriya taapmaana antat 10 megakelvin tak pahunch jayega jo ki wo taapmaana he jis par pehle dutirium main tathaa phir helium main protone-protone shrunkhlaa abhikriya dwaara hydrogen kaa sanlayan armbh ho jaataa he
 Nuclear fusion begins in a very short time, converting to hydrostatic equilibrium in which the energy emanating from the center and more gravity avoids the accident
 is prakaar tara teji se ek sthir sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 New stars are found in a variety of shapes and colors
 ve garm or nile rang se le kar shant or laal varnakram kismon main paae jate hai or unka dravyaman 0
5 se lekar 20 saura dravyamanon se adhik hota he
 The brightness and color of a star depends on its surface temperature, which in turn is dependent on its mass
 hertzsprang-rasel aarekh ke mukhya anukram ke vishisht bindu par ek nae taare kaa ant hoga
 Small, cool red dwarf stars burn hydrogen slowly and can remain on the main sequence for hundreds of billions of years, while larger hot super massive stars will leave the main sequence only a few million years later
 surya jaisaa ek madhyam aakaar kaa tara lagbhag 10 arab varshon tak mukhya anukram par rahe
 Ga It is believed that at this time the Sun is in the middle of its lifespan; Hence, it is on the main sequence
 ek baar jab ek tara apane nabhik kii adhikansh hydrogen kharch karata he to yah mukhya anukram se dur hat jaataa he
 According to its initial mass from maturity to millions to billions of years later, the continuous fusion of hydrogen into helium will cause helium to form in its nucleus
 baad ke varsh or taare kaa ant: Low-mass stars Some stars may cause helium fusion at certain sites in their nucleus, causing dense solar storms with an unstable and uneven response
 is maamle main, tara koi grah-sambandhi nebula nahin banegaa balki iske bajaae ek chote brown dwarf ke rup main saamaanya rup se lupt ho jayega
 lekin 0
5 saura dravyaman se chota tara nabhik dwaara hydrogen sanlayan samaapt karne ke baad bhi helium ke sanlayan main sakasham nahin hoga
 Because the stellar depth is not high enough to bear sufficient pressure in its nucleus
 ye red dwarf hai, jaise ki proxima centori, jiname se kuch surya se hajaaron varsh adhik samay tak jivit rahe
 Dange Recent astrophysical models suggest that red dwarfs of up to 0
1 solar mass can remain on the main sequence for about six bad years, and gradually take several hundred trillion years to convert to white dwarf
 It may take more

 In stars weighing less than 1
4 solar masses, the helium fusion process begins with an explosion of energy production known as a helium flash
 helium prajjvalan kriyaayein taapmaana ke prati atyant samvedansheel hai jo atyadhik asthirataa kaa kaaran banataa he
 a massive flutter is formed, which eventually gives enough kinetic energy to the outer layers of a star to form a planetary nebula

6 saura dravyaman ke baraabar he, lekin aaytan sirf prithvi ke samaan he
 White dwarfs Main article: White dwarfs White dwarfs are stable because the inward force of gravity is balanced by the degenerative pressure of the star's electrons
 kyonki jalaane ke liye koi eendhan nahin bachataa, tara apni bachi hui ooshmaa ko hajaaron lakhon saalon ke liye antariksh main chhod detaa he
 At the end, a cool dark colored mass remains called a black dwarf
 haalanki, brahmad itnaa purana nahin he ki isamen koi blike dwarf dikhaai de sake
 Supermassive stars After the outer layers of the star exceed five solar masses to form the supermassive red supergiant, the nucleus begins to produce gravity and begins to shrink
 jaise-jaise yah sikudta he, yah or adhik garm tathaa ghanaa hota jaataa he or parmaanu pratikriyaaon kii ek nai shrunkhlaa shuru hoti he
 These reactions dissolve progressively heavier elements, which protect the nucleus from temporary destruction
 neutron taare It is known that in some supernovae, intense gravitational forces push superimposed electrons into the atomic nucleus, where they combine with protons to form neutrons
 nabhik ko pare rakhane vaale vidyut chumbakeey bal hat jate hai or taare kaa puraa nabhik ek sannihit neutron kii ghani gend yaa ekal parmaanu nabhik ban jaataa he
 Black holes Main article: Black holes It is widely believed that not all supernova forms transform into neutron stars
 If the stellar mass is high enough, the neutron itself will be crushed and the star will be destroyed if its radius is not less than the Schwarzchild radius
 The star then becomes a black hole

 bachapan main unhone kabhi koi ek galati kii thi
 He should not forget that and then do not do that work again, whenever he used to wear a new garment to remember this thing, then put it on that cloth at that time and while writing, he used to cry so faintly that Would have been hasan al basri ne bahut baar kaha he ki is sansar ke pralobhanon main funskar us duusare sansar ko na bigaado

 Credit control 'credit control' is a system used by a business to do something that gives loans to customers who are only able to pay, and make customers pay on time
 rin niyantran vishesh rup se bikri kiya jaataa he ek baar ve nakad yaa taral sansadhano ke rup main mahasoos kar rahe hai ki yah sunishchit karne ke liye vinirmaan kshetra main vyavsaayon dwaara niojit kar rahe hai ki vittiya niyantran kaa hissaa he
 Credit control prevents business from becoming liquidity or even lending to a financial institution to cause improper and un-coordinated issuance of debt to customers and is an important system of control
 rin sweekruti, credit seemaa anumodan, preshan manjuuri or saath hi sangrah kii prakriya - credit niyantran bhi shaamil he ki virgon ke ek number he
 In a large business, a credit process is run by a senior manager and know your customer such as account opening, loan and credit limit approval, credit expansion and collection action effectually
 rin niyantran kii jaruratein yah he:arthvyavastha main rin ko niyantrit karne ke liye bhartiya rigerv bank kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaaryon ke bich he
 The basic and important requirements of debt control in the economy are- 1
unki aarthik sthiti yaa sarkaar byaaj par nirbhar karata he " praathamikta ke aadhaar par " ke rup main sarkaar dwaara manyata praapt he jo arthvyavastha ke un kshetron yani " praathamikta kshetra " ke samgr vikaas ko protsaahit karne ke liye
 These areas roughly total to about 15 in number
 2
credit avaanchhneeya uddeshyon ke liye nahin diya he, isliye he ki rin kaa tatikaran par ek check rakhane ke liye
 3
 To achieve the objective of controlling inflation as well as deflation
 4
vibhinn kshetron ke liye bank rin kii paryaapt maatra ke pravaah ko suvidhajanak banane ke dwaara arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene ke liye
 5
 To develop economy
 rin niyantran ke tareeke:do tareekon bhartiya rigerv bank arthvyavastha main mudra kii aapurti ko niyantrit karne ke liye upyog karata he ki kar rahe hai Qualitative quantitative quantitative method of inflation during the period of the Reserve Bank of India allows the commercial bank to pump money into the economy, while strengthening its policies to limit the money supply
 gunatmak vidhi gunvattta se ham nirdesh diya he jo bank rin kaa upyog karata he matlab he
 Banks, for example, may feel that the audience or big capitalists, while the small scale industries, are struggling with a shortage of consumer goods industries and agricultural credit, are getting mostly on a large portion of the total debt due to various disturbances and inequalities in the economy
 
 visangati ke is prakaar ke sanshodhan ke gunatmak rin niyantran kii baat he
 The qualitative method governs the way of channelizing cash and debt in the economy
 aisa lagata he ki sthiti ke aadhaar par 'praathamikta kshetra' ke rup main janaa jaataa he duusare ke liye ke rup main failata he, jahaan kuch khand ke liye rin ke rup main pratibandhit niyantran kaa ek 'chaynaatmak paddati' he
 The devices used under this method are- seemaant aavashyaktaa:rin kii seemaant aavashyaktaa = di gai rin kii rin-mulya ke liye peshkash kii suraksha ke vartmaan mulya
 There is a marginal need, which is attributed to the business activities of those who are restricted in the flow of the economy
 rin ke pravaah main vruddhi hui ho gaya he maamle main, seemaant aavashyaktaa kam ho jayega
 The Reserve Bank of India has used this method since 1956 
 rin kaa rashan:is vidhi ke tahat vanijyik bainkon se adhik nahin ho saktaa he, jo kiya ja saktaa he ki rin or agrim, ke liye ek adhiktam seemaa nahin he
 Reserve Bank of India fix ceiling for specific categories
 rin pravaah ko vishesh rup se satta gatividhiyon ke liye jaanch kii jaani he jab is tarah ke rashan sthitiyon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 The minimum number of "capital: total assets" can also be determined by the Reserve Bank of India prachaar:bhartiya rigerv bank ashaanti ko niyantrit karne ke liye vanijyik bainkon dwaara lagu kiya janaa aavashyak hoga ki bazaar kii maujuuda haalat par apane vichaaron or apni dishaao ke prachaar ke liye media kaa upyog karata he
 This method is not very successful in developing countries due to high illiteracy, although it is making it difficult for people to understand such policies and its implications
 sidhi kaarywahi:banking viniman adhinium ke tahat kendriya bank rigerv bank of india dwaara die gaye nirdeshon kaa paalan karne ke liye manaa kar diya he ki vanijyik bainkon se kisi ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kaa adhikaar he
 There can be no restriction on such banks to carry forward loans levied by the Reserve Bank of India
 jaise - bhartiya rigerv bank metropolitan sahakaari bainkon kii karypranali par kuch pratibandh laga diya tha
 Also 'bank of Karad' came to an end in 1992
 naitik anunay:is vidhi ko bhi rigerv bank ja rahaa he ki bhartiya rigerv bank, yahan kaa upyog karata he rin ke pravaah par apane nirdeshon / adeshon kaa paalan karne ke liye vanijyik bainkon ko raji karne kaa he ki vidhi ke rup main "naitik anunay" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The Reserve Bank of India pressures commercial banks to put a ceiling on credit flow during deflation and to be lenient in lending
 maatraatmak paddati:maatraatmak rin niyantran se ham rin kii kul maatra kaa niyantran matlab he
 Consider, for example, that the central bank of America considers the rupee based on its calculations
 50,000 credit ke vistaar ke liye adhiktam surakshit seemaa he
 But the actual credit at that point of time is Rs
 55,000 
 Thus it then becomes necessary for the central bank to tighten its policies to bring it down to 50,000
 vaastavik credit kam he isi tarah agar, 45,000, to rigerv bank arthvyavastha main credit pumping ke paksh main apni nitiyon ko niyantrit karata he kahana
 The various devices used under this method are- yah bhi chhot dar ke rup main janaa jaataa he bank dar desh ke kendriya bank videshi mudra kii manjuuri de di bilon rediscount yaa anumodith pratibhutiyon par udhaar dene ke liye taiyaar he, jis par adhikari ne nunatam dar he
 Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934, "it is remodeled for bill-exemption of market or other commercial paper eligible for purchase or purchase under this Act, at which the standard rate" The bank defines the rate
 udhaaharan ke liye vanijyik bank, vrath yaa uske sabhi uplabdh dhanrashi kaa nivesh kiya or or adhik se nirdhaarit nunatam upar kam yaa koi nakadi he gaya he, yah dhan ke liye kendriya bank puch sakate hai
 It can either rebate some of its bills with the central bank or it can automatically borrow from the central bank against the collateral of the promissory note
 yaa to maamle main, kendriya bank vanijyik bank accommodates or baad kii nakadi bhandar bad jaati he

 Hip-hop dance is more than 30 years old, but it was first discussed extensively in the 1970s when professionals formed a group of breaking, locking, and popping
 The most influential groups include The Rock Steady Crew The Lockers and The Electric Boogalooz, who are responsible for the spread of breaking, locking and popping respectively
 Parallel to the development of hip-hop music, hip-hop dance also became mainstream in various forms of breaking and funk styles, such as "running man" and "cabbage patch", and became fad dance
 The dance industry was particularly attracted to studio / commercial hip-hop, which was once renamed New Style or Jazz Funk
 These styles were developed by technically trained dancers who saw it performed on the street and who wanted to choreograph from hip-hop dance to hip-hop music

 For others, it has become a lifestyle: a way to be active in physical fitness or participate in dance competitions and to earn a livelihood by dancing professionally

 Breaking was invented in the early 1970s in the Bronx of New York
 Although black Americans are credited with inventing braking, it was the Latinoes who kept the braking alive when it was considered to be finished in the late '70s
 He was the Afrika Bombatta who considered breaking one of the five pillars of hip-hop culture into which King, Jing, Graffiti writing and knowledge were classified
 Due to this condition it is considered the purest form of hip-hop dance
 Breaking involves four basic dances: toprock - footwork oriented steps while standing, downrock - handling your weight with your hand while performing footwork; Freezes - Stylish steps and power moves on your hand - hard and effective ways of acrobatics
 The Apache line is responsible for diversifying the traditional ciphers into breaking
 The cipher is more appropriate when competing between one-versus-one be-buoys while the Apache line is correct when one team is competing with another group
 Competitive teams can face each other and make their own special performance in making this line

 Popping was composed by Sam Solomon in Fresno, California and performed by his group The Electic Boogalooz
 It is based on the technique of rapidly narrowing and loosening the muscles in the dancer's body known as pop or hit
 Each hit must be combined with the melody and rhythm of the music
 Popping is also referred to by the term Umbrella, indicating that it has a wide range of more than 10 confusing dance styles, such as strobeing, liquid, animation, and waving used in conjunction with standard popping
 Goes so that various performances can be done
 In all these sub-genres, the audience feels as if the body is popping as per the name
 The difference between each sub-genre is how exaggerated the popping in them is
 The actions of the body in liquid look like water
 Popping is done so easily that the actions do not seem to be popping, they are fluid
 The opposite is ticking, in which actions are static, sudden and jerky
 popping- jise ambrella shabd se sambodhit kiya jaataa he, usamen gliding, floating or sliding bhi shaamil he jo taangon or pairon dwaara nichle sharir se kiya jane vaala nrity he
 jab sahi tareeke se kiya jaataa he to lagata he ki nartak zamin par is tarah se gliding kar rahe hai jaise ki barf par

 "while Sam was creating popping and boogaloo, others were creating and practicing unique styles of their own
 Back in the day many different areas in the west coast were known for their own distinct styles, each with their own rich history behind them
 Some of these areas included Oakland, Sacramento and San Francisco
 " haalanki hip-hop nartakon dwaara popping kaa istemaal ambrella turm ke taur par kiya jaataa he lekin electric bugaloos ke popin peet popping ke is tarah ke istemaal se asahmat hai

 There are many international hip-hop dance competitions
 Most of these competitions are limited to regional tournaments of a specific country or continent
 These competitions not only give the group or soloist a regional title, but also provide a chance as to the eligibility for the final round of the international championship

 Tectonic is a dance form that includes vogue, breaking, and popping that was introduced at the Metropolis nightclubs in Paris, France
 Like hip-hop dance, it is associated with young dancers and tectonic dancers, who compete on the streets and in clubs, but because of their music and original club, the genre is well suited under the house dance category

 As already mentioned, the dance group is a group of street dancers who together make dance moves
 With the spread of hip-hop culture in New York, more and more groups started practicing together and competing with each other
 This was the time when the different dancing postures of breaking were developed in a organized manner
 The same thing can be said about the various dance postures of funk styles, and the crumping of the '90s
 When these styles started, the only way to learn them was to be part of the team
 Creating and participating in a dance party depended on how you practiced or improved, made friends and formed relationships
 Initially, the members of the Toli were based on neighborhood and battled in their respective cities
 In the competitions held today, teams can compete with other teams from across the country and from all over the world

 Although hip-hop is more prevalent in dance groups, dance companies exist both in the United States and abroad
 Examples include Culture Shock, Lux Eterna Boy Blue Entertainment Entertainment, Bounce Street Dance Company, 2 Faced Dance, Funkbrella Dance Company, Blaze Street Dance Company and Zoo Nation
 "street dancing was never ever ever to a count
 You do not count a 1,a 2,a 3,a 4, a 5, a 6 to hip hop
 It should be a feeling by making noise like "ou" "ah" "aw" "tsi", that's how we count, right there
" The dance industry reacted to hip-hop dance by making it a more commercial version
 Sometimes called the new genre, this "studio hip-hop" is seen in most music videos and concerts in rap and R&B
 From the point of view of someone deeply immersed in hip-hop culture, anything that looks like hip-hop dance and has not come from the streets is not a true hip hop dance style
 In an interview with Dance magazine, hip-hop dance teacher Emilio "buddha Stretch" Austin, Jr
 explains how they see it: bahut se log is bhaavana ko pratidhwanit karte hai, manch pradarshan iske vikaas kii ore mukt bahane kii us prakriya ko pratibandhit kar sakate hai jo pehle hip hop nrity ke vikaas ko paribhaashit karti thi
 vibhinn nrity shaileyon ko ek saath milaane se unki sanrachana or unki pahchaan samaapt ho jaati he
 From a technical aspect, hip-hop dance is characterized by flexibility and isolation - pushing a certain part of the body apart from the others, hitting it harder
 The feet are on the ground, the chest is down, and the body is kept loose so that a dancer can easily make changes between riding through a beating beat or beat
 This is unlike ballet or ballroom dancing, where the chest is out and the body is stiff
 In addition, the new genre of hip-hop is very rhythmic and the emphasis is on musicality - how sensitive your tempo is to music - and capable of freestyle

 In response to the growing popularity of hip-hop dance, other developments occurred in the industry
 There were tap, ballet, and jazz dance conferences on the travel conference circuit, but there was nothing in particular for hip-hop
 The same emptiness was also there in dancewear
 There were dance costumes for tap, ballet and jazz dancers but not for hip-hop dancers
 To meet this need, naptitabs dancewear was manufactured
 Monsters of hip-hop is the first convention of all hip-hop dances
 It was founded in 2003 by Andy Funk, his wife Becky, and his sister Angie Cervant in Baltimore
 The conference now travels to several cities in the United States and to Mexico
 Its faculty table also includes Dave Scott, Teresa Espinosa and Marty Kudelka, among others
 Napytabs are the first line of dance costumes made specifically for hip-hop dancers
 Since napitabs went to the urban dance community, they do not sell leotardes / unitards, tights or leg warmers
 Their line includes tanks, B-ball shorts, T-shirts, sweats and hoodies
 In 2009, he was supported by second-placed Beat Fricks of the third season of America's Best Dance Toli

 dance spirit patrika ke anusaar jo gey hip-hop ko maanak nai style hip-hop se alag karata he vah yah he ki nartak biton kii vyakhya alag prakaar se karte hai
 Some hip-hop purists feel that the explanatory and soft style means this is not hip-hop at all
 Other hip hop choreographers such as Shane Sparks feel that the genre is hip-hop but has its own genre due to substantial differences
 Of all the sub-genres of hip-hop dance, lyrical hip-hop is the latest
