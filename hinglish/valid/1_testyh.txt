abdunnavi ke saamne ja pahunche
 The Mughals were killed two-way
 The soldier was killed by a bullet
 bache khuche mogul bhaag gaye
 Gokulsingh went ahead and looted the cantonment of Sadabad and set it on fire
 iskaa dhuaan or lapten itani unchi uth gayi ki agra or dilli ke mehalon main jhat se dikhaai de gayi
 Why do they not even appear The nomination of the cantonment of the empire's Wazir Sadulla Khan was erased
 mathura hi nahi, agra jile main se bhi shahi jhande ke nishaan udakar agra shahar or kile main dher ho gaye the
 Life was communicated among the frustrated and dead Hindus
 unhen dikhaai diya ki aparaajay mogul-shakti ke vish-danta tode ja sakate hai
 He appeared to be the keeper of his future hopes - a restorer Gokulsingh
 iske baad paanch maah tak bhayankar yuddh hote rahe
 All the preparations of the Mughals and the chosen generals proved to be ineffective and unsuccessful
 What soldiers and what commander sat above all Gokul Singh's valor and terror of conducting war
 ant main sitambar maas main, bilkul niraash hokar, shaf shikan khan ne gokulasinh ke paas sandhi-prastaav bheja ki- 1
 The emperor is ready to pardon them
 2
 ve lutaa hua sabhi saaman lautaa den

 Promise not to revolt in the future
 gokulasinh ne poocha meraa aparaadh kya he, jo main badshaah se kshamaa maanguga ? tumhaare badshaah ko mujhase kshamaa maangani chahie, kyonki usne akaaran hi mere dharm kaa bahut apmaan kiya he, bahut haani kii he
 Secondly, who trusts his forgiveness and pleading in this world? iske aage sandhi kii charchaa chalaanaa vyarth tha
 Gokulsingh did not leave any scope
 aurangzeb kaa vichaar tha ki gokulasinh ko bhi 'raja' yaa 'thakur' kaa khitaab dekar rijhaa liya jaayegaa or mughalon kaa ek or paaltu bad jaayegaa
 hindustan ko 'daarul islam' banane kii uski suvichaarit yojana nirvighn aage babbti rahegi
 magar gokulasinh ke aage uski kuta niti buree tarah maat kha gayi
 Therefore, Aurangzeb himself started to deal with this unprecedented opponent with a large army, cannons and artillery
 This is one such vivid and inspiring example of breaking of traditions and dignity, which has not gone unnoticed by historians
 europea yatri manuchee ke vrittant ke anusaar pehle akbar ko janaa padaa tha or ab aurangzeb ko, jiskaa samrajya na sirf mughalon main hi balki us samay tak sabhi hindu-muslim shaskaon main sabase bada tha
 This was the greatness of Veevara Gokulsingh
 Aurangzeb, arriving from Delhi, reached Mathura on 28 November 1669
 gokulasinh ke anek sainik or senapati jo vetanbhogi nahin the, kranti bhaavana se anupranit log the, rabi kii buvaai ke silsile main, pados ke agra janapad main chale gaye the
 Aurangzeb built his cantonment in Mathura and from there started the whole war operation
 gokulasinh ko chaaron ore se gheraa ja rahaa tha
 He sent another commander Hasan Ali Khan with a strong and well-equipped army on behalf of Mursan
 Hasan Ali Khan conducted a raid on the morning of December 4, 1669, encircling the three Jat strongholds - Rewada, Chandrakhar and Sarkharu
 shahi topon or banduukon kii maar ke aage ye choti gadhiyaan zyada upyogi siddh na ho sakin or badi jaldi tut gayi
 Pleased with the successes of Hasan Ali Khan, Aurangzeb replaced him with Mathura, replacing him with Shaf Shikan Khan
 uski sahaayta ke liye agra pargane se amanulla khan, muradabad kaa faujadaar namdaar khan, agra shahar kaa faujadaar hoshayar khan apni-apni senaaon ke saath aa pahunche 
 yah vishaal sena chaaron ore se gokulasinh ko gheraa lagaate huue aage badhane lagi
 This campaign against Gokulsingh was of a great scale from the invasions which had been taking place against the great kingdoms and the kings there
 is vir ke paas na to bade-bade durg the, na aravali kii pahadiyaan or na hi maharashtra jaisaa vividhtapurna bhugolic pradesh
 in alaabhakaari sthitiyon ke baavjood, unhone jis dhairya or ran-chaaturya ke saath, ek shaktishaalee samrajya kii kendriya shakti kaa saamana karke, barabari ke parinaam praapt kiye, vah sab abhootpurv he
 In the last week of December 1669, 20 miles from Tilpat, Gokulsingh faced the imperial forces
 jaaton ne mogul sena par ek drudh nishchay or bhayankar krodh se akraman kiya
 The war continued from morning to evening
 koi nirnay nahin ho sakaa
 There was a fierce battle the next day
 jat alokik veerta ke saath yuddh kar rahe the
 The Mughal army, with its cavalry equipped with artillery and jirbakhtar, could not conquer Gokulsingh
 bharat ke itihaas main aise yuddh kam hue hai jahaan kai prakaar se baadhit or kamjor paksh, itane shant nishchay or adig dhairya ke saath ladaa ho
 The battle for the Haldi valley was decided within a few hours
 panipat ke teenon yuddh ek-ek din main hi samaapt ho gaye the, parantu veeravar gokulasinh kaa yuddh tisare din bhi chalaa
 On the third day, a fierce battle ensued
 iske bare main ek itihaaskaar kaa kahana he ki jaaton kaa akraman itnaa prabal tha ki shahi sena ke pair ukhd hi gaye the, parantu tabhi hasan ali khan ke netritv main ek nai tazaadam mogul sena aa gayi
 This army turned Gokulsingh's victory into defeat
 badshaah alamgir kii izzat batch gayi
 The Jats got uprooted, yet they did not run away from their homes
 His destination became the fortress of Tilpat, which was twenty miles from the battlefield
 tisare din se yahan bhi bheeshan yuddh chhid gaya or teen din tak chalata rahaa
 Tilpat's fortress could not stand in front of it amid heavy cannons and it fell down
 tilapat ke patan ke baad gokulasinh or unke taaoo udaisingh ko sapariwaar bandi bana liya gaya
 His seven thousand companions were also arrested
 They were all brought to Agra
 aurangzeb pehle hi aa chukaa tha or laal kile ke diwane aam main aashwast hokar, virajman tha
 All the detainees were presented before him
 aurangzeb ne kaha - Most Jats said - "king, if the path of your God and Rasul is the one you are following, then we should not follow your path
" agle din gokulasinh or udaisingh ko agra kotwali par laayaa gaya-usee tarah bandhe haath, gale se pair tak lohe main jakadaaa sharir
 gokulasinh kii sudaul bhujaa par jallaad kaa pehla kulhada chalaa, to hajaaron kaa jansamooh haahaakaar kar uthaa
 kulhadi se chhitaki hui unki daayin bhujaa chabutare par girakar fadakane lagi
 But not only the face of that hero was also flawless
 usne ek nigaah phuwwara ban gaye kandhe par daali or fir jallaadon ko dekhne laga ki doosraa waar karen
 But the executioners were not in a hurry
 unhen aise hi nirdesh the
 Thousands of people got up on the second ax
 Among them were Hindus and Muslims
 anekon ne ankhen band karali
 anek rote hue bhaag nikle
 As if Holocaust was happening around the police station
 ek ko duusare kaa hosh nahin tha
 There was only one sound in the atmosphere- "hey Ram! 


 Hey Rahim !! Gokulsingh's head fell here in Agra, Keshavraiji's temple in Mathura!" samarvir gokulah kisaan kranti kaa kavy Shri Balveer Singh 'karun', a respected and revered poet of Rajasthan, is now known on all India level due to his lyrical poetry and progressive Indian life vision and effective word work
 rashtrakavi dinakar kii kavyachetana se anupranit karun ji nalanda kii vichaar sabha main dinakar ji ke aksharputra kii oopaadhi se alankrita ho chuke hai
 This powerful and intelligent poet has brought to life a neglected chapter of the seventeenth century by composing a poetic poem called 'samaraveer Gokula'
 varna-jati or swarg-apvarg kii chintaa karne vaala yah desh jab tab apane ko bhul jaataa he
 Like Khaz in the leprosy, the leftist historian and litterateur removes pages from the history of the independent struggle
 parantu pragatisheel rashtriya kavy dhara ne nayi ooshmaa evam nayi urja se sfoort hokar apni lekhnee tham lee he
 The result is - 'samaravir Gokula'
 samaran rahe ki reetikaal ke shrangarik vaataavaran main bhi sarv shri guru govind singh, laalakavi, bhushan, sudan or chandrasekhar ne vir kavy kii rachana kii thi
 His inspiration was the national spirit
 aadhunik yug main balvir singh ‘karun’ ne ‘vijay ketu’ or ‘main dronacharya bolta hoon’ ke baad ikkisvin sadi ke pratham dashak main ‘samar vir gokula’ kii bhavy prastuti kii he
 This is a testimony to the poise of 'vijay Ketu' and the flourishing of progressive history vision
 ‘samarvir gokula satrahavin sadi kii kisaan kranti kaa rashtriya prabandh kavy he
 The poet has written in the role- 'maharana Pratap, Maharana Raj Singh, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Hasan Khan Mewati, Guru Gobind Singh, Mahavir Gokula and Jat rulers of Bharatpur apart from Jat rulers who cannot openly defy Mughal authority
 
 vir gokula kaa naam isliye pramukhataa se liya jaae ki dilli kii naak ke neeche unhone hunkaar bhari thi or 20 hajaar krishak sainikon kii fouj khadi kar di thi jo avaitnaik, aprashikshit or gharelu astr-shastron se susajjit thi
 Not forgetting this for expansion, he came to make his life to protect the nation
 ’ Shyamnarayan Pandey composed 'haldighati', Pandit Mohanlal Mahato 'viyogi' Praneeth 'aryavart', Prabhakarit 'rashtrapush' and Shrikrishna 'saral', the discussion of poetry is closed
 niraala rachit ‘tulsidas’ or ‘shivaji kaa patr’-donon rachanaayen upekshit hai
 The poems of Dinkar and Nepali are being forgotten
 tathaapi kavy main pragatisheel bhartiya jivan drushti kii rachanaayen nayi chetana ke saath aane lagati hai
 The proof is - the acclaimed performance of 'samarveer Gokula'
 is kavy kii mahatprerana aisi rahi ki yah maatr chalis dinon main likhaa gaya
 Its main purpose is that a struggling chapter of Indian history took the form of poetry and attracted attention in poetry
 madhyakaalin shaury evam shahadat rashtriya sanchetana se sanjeevit hokar prabandhkavy main goonjane lagi
 The fiery devoted personality of the chartered Jat farmer shone with his splendor
 itihaas main damit narnahar gokul kaa charitra chhandon main sabake samaksh aa gaya
 This management of eight cantos is an important contribution of the first decade of the twenty-first century
 kavi ne mathura ke kisaan kul main janame gokul ke sangharsh kii upeksha kii peeda ko saha he
 That victim has tried to give Kavyanjali to the neglected in the national context
 aadi kavi kii karunaa kaa samaran karen phir kavi ‘karun’ kii peeda kii prerana kaa mahatva spasht ho jaayegaa
 That is why the poet has presented the peasant personality of Gokul to the Mughal emperor in the first session
 ucchkul ke naayakatv ke nikash ko gokul ne badal diya tha
 So, how long would Gokul be ignored in the era of upliftment of the peasant-worker-dalit! He struggled vigorously for the survival and identity of peasant life
 videshi mughal shashan dwaara kisaan daman ke virodh kaa sankalp kiya
 Resolved to oppose peasant repression by foreign Mughal rule
 isliye kavi ne pratham sarg main likhaa he- The poet has realized that Gokul Emperor of Tilpat had become a cause of concern for Aurangzeb
 parantu apano ne kya kiya? - In the second canto the poet has depicted the odd conditions of the era and Indian optimism in historical and natural context through his poetry
 prakruti kaa samay chakra aashaa jagaata he - See the fascinating forms of human life and hope of Indian vision - brajamandal main hi nayak gokul kaa janm hua
 This formed the basis of optimism
 teesraa sarg gokul ke kisaan jivan kii chitrawali he-bimbon evam chitron main
 Such depiction of peasant life is rare elsewhere
 kavi kii anubhoot kisaani apni samvednaa evam shramotfull masti ke saath prastut hui he
 As a result, the management of this peasant life has become poetry
 par mughal shashan main kisaan apana pet bhar nahin paata tha
 Taxation was horrific
 jajia to kafir kisaan ke liye bhayanak dandswaroop aropit tha
 Therefore, the pain kept deepening
 parantu kavi mughal shashan ke kathorekrur shashan kaa marmaantak varnan nahin kar sakaa he
 The outrage and rebellion from direct atrocity is naturally described in the fourth canto
 yah sarg kranthichetana or sangharsh ke sankalp kaa ban gaya he
 It is true that the farmers of Mathura were not part of Kanha and Baldau
 ve apane gaurav kii yadakar singh ke samaan garajane lage
 The national consciousness of the poet does not speak only of Mathura and Jat farmers
 vah to hindustan ke lohu kaa samaran rakhata he
 That is why the throne of Delhi was tolerated
 udhar bees hajaar kisaan sangathit hokar takht ke khilaaf khadey ho gayi
 See the progressive vision of the poet's writings samskruti se judkar janchetana jaagrit hoti he
 Gokul started cheering against Mughal tyranny
 sangharsh armbh ho gaya
 The poet has given an authentic description of the freedom struggle of Gokul and his Kisan Kranti Sena in the following three cantos
 rashtriya drushti se mughal hukumat ke damankaaree rup, kisaanon kaa aakrosh or sankalit sangharsh ke shaury kaa varnan is yuddh kii visheshtaayen hai
 The poet has sparked a new national consciousness by showing the struggle of the peasant army of the seventeenth century in the twenty-first century
 yah upekshit adhyay dhul jhadkar apane tejasvi rup ko dikhaakar anupranit kar rahaa he
 In the fifth and sixth canto, the poet Karun has shown the horrific struggle of Sadabad and Tilpat in his well-known narration style and with iconic craft
 nayak gokul kavy kaa vyaktitv hi aisa he- Such gallantry Gokul had taken over the Mughal cantonment Sadabad and surprised the Mughals
 par itihaaskaaron ne upeksha kar di
 Hence the poet has written- ye itihaaskaar mughalon ke videshi atyaachaari rup par maun hi rahete hai
 But the poet Balvir Singh has given a lively depiction of Aurangzeb, frightened by the valor of Gokul - uskaa singhaasana dol uthaa
 The geography of the empire shrunk
 isliye khud aurangzeb san 1669 main bady fouj lekar aa dhamka
 a fierce struggle started in Tilpat, the center of Gokul
 us yuddh kaa ek chitra dekhen - The war continued
 mughal fouj kii takat babbti gayi
 The pressure on Tilpat kept increasing
 antim kshan tak gokul apane chachaa udai singh ke saath yuddh karata rahaa
 Defeat became destiny
 kaid hokar aurangzeb ke saamne laayaa gaya
 He fearlessly expressed his extreme hatred for the tyrannical emperor
 saptam sarg pramaan he
 Aurangzeb was stunned by this stunning peasant hero
 usne maut kii sajaa suna di
 The alternative was conversion
 ashtum sarg- antim sarg prabandhkavy kaa utkarsh he
 The poet has narrated the nature of nature, the mystification of nature and the immortality of soul according to Indian thought, as the role of the death sentence declared on account of freedom struggle
 kavi kahata he- Hence Gokul will not abandon his religion
 ve donon dandit hokar amar ho janaa chaahate hai
 In this odd situation - Swatantrayasangram, defeat and death or conversion, the question of the poet is a question of national consciousness - ye sab ujjwal taare ban kar It is remembered that after the struggle and martyrdom of 1670, the Satnamis have given martyrdom
 shivaji kaa sangharsh 1674 main safal hua tha
 But in 1675 Guru Tegh Bahadur sacrificed for Kashmir
 par bharatpur ke surajmal ne swatantray dhvaj ko fahraa diya
 Perhaps the result of this series of struggles was fifteen August 1947
 itihaas ko is sangharsh-shrankhla ko bhoolanaa nahin he
 The writer will not let you forget
 balvir singh ‘karun’ kaa yah prabandhkavy apana auchity siddh kar rahaa he
 The poet is inspired by seventeenth-century nationalist consciousness of the twenty-first century
 atah iskaa mulya batch jaataa he
 This management is an achievement of Hindi poetry
 kavi kii lekhnee kaa abhinandan he

 In return, the British launched a war against Julu
 gandhi ji ne bharatiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye british adhikariyon ko sakriy rup se prerit kiya
 His argument was that Indians should cooperate in war efforts to legalize their citizenship claims
 tathaapi, angrejon ne apni sena main bharatiyon ko pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he accepted Gandhiji's proposal that Indians can do voluntary work to bring wounded British soldiers to Stetcher for treatment

 This situation was disappointing

 Gandhiji built an ashram there where many of his supporters and new voluntary workers were organized

 lekin iske pramukh prabhaav us samay dekhne ko mili jab unhen ashaanti failaane ke liye police ne giraftaar kiya or unhen praant chhodane ke liye aadesh diya gaya
 Thousands of people protested and took out rallies outside jails, police stations and courts and demanded Gandhi ji to be released unconditionally

 The Jallianwala massacre of Indians by the British forces in Punjab, also known as the Amritsar massacre, caused tremendous shock to the nation, which sparked a flame of anger and violence in the public

 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress

 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women

 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua

 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties

 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore

 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar

 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933

 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party

 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence

 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public
 did
 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border

 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence

 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail

 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries

 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to accept the matter and the government had to stick to its policy and make payments to Pakistan

 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent

 In an interview given after the war in 1946, he presented an idea even further
 yahudiyon ko apane liye swayan kasaai kaa chaaku de dena chahie tha
 They should have thrown themselves into the sea from sea rocks
 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice

 Before coming to London to study, Gandhiji had made a promise to his mother Putlibai and his uncle Bechariji Swamy that he would abstain from eating meat, drinking alcohol and from concussion
 unhone apane vaayade rakhane ke liye upwas kiye or aisa karne se saboot kuch aisa mila jo bhojan karne se nahin mil saktaa tha, unhone apane jivan paryant darshan ke liye aadhaar jo praapt kar liya tha
 As Gandhi became an adult he became completely vegetarian
 unhone da moral basis of vegeterionism tathaa is vishay par bahut si lekh bhi likhen hai jinamein se kuch landan vegeterian sosayadi ke prakaashan da vegeterian main prakashit bhi hue hai
 Gandhi himself was inspired by many great personalities during this period and became a friend of Dr
 Josiah Oldfield, the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society
 henry stephen salt|henry stephen salt kii kritiyon ko padhne or prashansha karne ke baad yuva mohandas gandhi shaakaahaari prachaarak se mili or unke saath patrachaar kiya
 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarian at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death
 His autobiography notes that being a vegetarian is a celibacy
 His success in total control celibacy without first ladder to re commitment, almost failed

 However, one day his uncle came to give Gandhi ji some time relief, he reached the bedroom for rest where his physical desires were awakened and he loved his wife and shortly after the servant left, the news came that Gandhi His father has just died
 Gandhiji felt a tremendous crime and he could never forgive himself for this
 This incident in m had a significant impact on Gandhi and he turned to celibacy at the age of 36, while he was married
 yah nirnay brahmacharya ke darshan se puri tarah prabhavit tha aadhyatmik or vyavhaarik shuddhta bade paimaane par brahmacharya or vairagyavaad se juda hota he

 Gandhiji believed that if a person is employed in social service, then he should move on to a more ordinary life, which he considered necessary for celibacy
 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes
 On one occasion, he also returns the gift provided to the birthmother for his continued service to the Samudayas

 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer
 unki kuch tippaniyan vibhinn dharmo ke sandarbh main is prakaar hai : Later when asked if you are a Hindu, he said: ek duusare ke prati gaharaa aadar bhav hone ke baavjood gandhi or rabindranath thakur ek se adhik baar lambi bahes main lage rahe
 These debates reflect philosophical differences between the two
 ye donon hi us samay ke prasiddh bhartiya chintak the
 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he
 Therefore, we should learn from this catastrophe of Bihar that while remaining a few short breaths, we should get rid of this stigma of untouchability and enable ourselves to appear before our Creator with a clean heart
 25 janvari ko bhi unhone logon ko is ghatana ke sandarbh main asprishyata ko mahapaap maanakar tyaagane kii prerana di tathaa 26 janvari ko madura main vyapaariyon dwaara yojit swaagat samaaroh main unhone kaha ki mujhe to yah vishwaas hota ja rahaa he ki ham par yah vipatti asprishyata ke is mahapaap ke falswaroop hi ai he
 i request you not to laugh at my words and think that i am awakening your instinct of superstition

 i may be called superstitious, but what i am feeling in the depths of my heart, i cannot live without telling you
 


 yadi aap bhi meri hi tarah is baat main vishwaas karte hon to aap nirnay karne main tatparta baratenge or yah maanenge ki aaj ham jaisi asprishyata baratate hai waisi asprishyata kaa vidhaan hindu shastron main nahin he
 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God
 yadi main apane ghor agyaan ke kaaran us vishwaas kaa upyog apane virodhiyon kii ninda karne ke liye karuun to nishchay hi aisa vishwaas patankaaree andhvishwaas ban jaayegaa
 Instead of making an air debate on Gandhiji and making arbitrary conclusions, it is not only an age-old requirement but also a prudence to keep in mind the authenticity of the basis of Gandhiji's beliefs
 saamaanya se vishisht tak -- sabhi sandarbhon main dastaveji rup praapt gandhi ji kaa likhaa-bolaa praayah prayek shabd adhyayan ke liye uplabdh he
 So it is naturally necessary that in view of them, something should be taken to a proper stage
 likhane kii pravriti gandhiji main aarambh se hi thi
 Throughout his life he has written more than Vachik

 In addition to writing many books, he also took out many magazines and wrote them well

 When he returned to India, he started a monthly magazine called 'navajivan'
 baad main navajivan kaa prakaashan hindi main bhi hua
 Apart from this, he wrote letters to individuals and newspapers almost everyday gandhi ji dwaara moulik rup se likhit pustaken chaar hai-- hind swaraj, dakshin africa ke satyagrah kaa itihaas, satya ke prayog, tathaa gita padaarth kosh sahit sampurna gita kii tikaa
 Gandhiji usually wrote in Gujarati, but translated or got his books translated into Hindi and English as well
 hind swaraj naamak alpakaay granthratna gandhiji ne england se lautate samay kildonon casil naamak jahaaj par gujarati main likhaa tha or unke dakshin africa pahunchne par indian opinian main prakashit hua tha
 The first twelve chapters in the December 11, 1909 issue and the remaining in the December 18, 1909 issue
 pustak rup main iskaa prakaashan pehali baar janvari 1910 main hua tha or bharat main bombay sarkaar dwaara 24 march 1910 ko iske prachaar par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 Gandhiji responded to this action of the Bombay Government by publishing an English translation of it

 'history of South Africa's Satyagraha' originally started writing 'south African Satyagrahana History' in Gujarati on 26 November 1923 while he was in Yerwada Jail
 5 farvari 1924 ko reeha hone ke samay tak unhone pratham 30 adhyay likh daale the
 This history was published as an article in the 'navajivan' from 13 April 1924 to 22 November 1925
 pustak ke rup main iske do khand kramshah 1924 or 1925 main chape
 The first edition of the English translation by Valji Desai was published by S
 Ganesan Madras in 1928 and the second and third editions by Navjivan Prakashan Mandir, Ahmedabad in 1950 and 1961, with the required modifications
 aatmakatha ke mul gujarati adhyay dharawahik rup se 'navajivan' ke ankon main prakashit hue the
 It began with the publication of 'preamble' in the issue of 29 November 1925 and its completion from the last chapter titled 'purnahuti' in the 3 February 1929 issue
 gujarati adhyyon ke prakaashan ke saath hi hindi navajivan main unka hindi anuwaad or yang india main unka angreji anuwaad bhi diya jaataa rahaa
 Accordingly, the translation of 'preamble' was published in the 3 December 1925 issue of 'hindi Navajivan'
 hindi anuwaad main aatmakatha kaa pehla khand pustak ke rup main pehali baar sasta sahitya mandal, dilli se san 1928 main prakashit hua tha
 Navjivan Trust, the proprietor of Gandhiji's works, published his Hindi translation on his behalf in 1957
 shrimadbhagavadgita se gandhi ji kaa hardik lagaav praayah aaajeevan rahaa
 His contemplation and writing on the Gita also continued for a long time
 sampoorn gita kaa gujarati anuwaad, prastaavna sahit, unhone june 1929 main puraa kiya tha or 12 march 1930 ko navajivan prakaashan mandir, ahmedabad se 'anasakti yoga' naam se uskaa pustakaakaar prakaashan hua tha
 Its translation into Hindi, Bangla and Marathi was also instant
 angreji anuwaad iske baad janvari 1931 main sampann hua tha tathaa pehle yang india ke ank main prakashit hua tha
 Since the translation of each verse of the Gita was not easily comprehensible to the general readers, Gandhi ji wrote the expressions of each chapter of the Gita in a comprehensible way for the general readers
 yarvada central jail main 1930 or 1932 main prayek saptaah patr ke rup main ye bhav bhi narayandas gandhi ko bheje jate rahe taaki unhen ashram kii prarthana sabhaaon main padhe jaayen
 These were later published in book form named 'geeta-bodh'
 inke atirikt bhi unhone gita par prarthana sabhaaon main anek pravachan diye the
 Gandhiji's association with the Gita was such that despite his very busy life he prepared a syllabus for each verse of the Gita specifying the meaning of the verse as well as his place of use
 in samast samagriyon kaa ekatra prakaashan hi 'gita mata' ke naam se hua he
 The decision of the publication of a Granthamala by the Government of India for the publication of the complete and written literature of Gandhiji has undoubtedly been a historic step in the publishing world
 is granthmala kaa uddeshy gandhi ji ne din-prati-din or varsh-prati-varsh jo kuch kaha or likhaa us sabko ekatra karnaa tha
 Under this decision, the entire Gandhi Vaamya was published with the help of many learned scholars
 yah prakaashan teen bhashaaon main hua
 It has been published for the first time in 100 volumes in English and 98 volumes in revised form
 hindi main 97 khandon main tathaa gujarati main 70 khandon main yah prakashkeey mahakumbh sampann hua he
 Two additional features are also included in the entire Gandhi speech
 ek to yah ki prayek khand ke ant main aksharkram se shabdanukramanika di gayi he jisase adhyayan tathaa vibhinn kaaryvash punarawalokan main atyant suvidha ho gayi he; tathaa duusari yah ki prayek khand ke ant main gandhi ji kaa tareekhwar jivan-vrittant diya gaya he, jisase saraltapurvak ek nazar main gandhiji ke jivan kii sabhi mahatvapurn ghatnaon evam baton kii sankshipt jaankaree uplabdh ho jaati he
 In addition to this, the collection of selected pieces from Gandhiji's entire literature and small booklets focusing on different topics have also been published under different names
 inamen do sanchayan ati prasiddh tathaa atyupayogi rahe hai or in donon kaa prakaashan bhi gandhi ji ke jivan-kaal main hi ho gaya tha: Gandhiji has also interpreted John Ruskin's Unto This Last in Gujarati
 antim niabandh ko unka arthshaastra se sambandhit kaarykram kaha ja saktaa he unhone shaakaahaar, bhojan or swasthya, dharm, saamaajik sudhaar par bhi vistaar se likhaa he
 In 2000, a revised version of Gandhiji's entire work came under controversy as Gandhiji's followers accused the government of including changes for political purposes
 kai jeevani lekhakon ne gandhi ke jivan-varnan kaa kaary kiya he
 Two of them are widespread and examples in themselves: is duusare mahagranth ke antim khand kaa chaar khandon main hindi anuwaad mahatma gandhi : purnahuti naam se prakashit he

 Due to this reason there was a dispute in India at the time of publication of the book, and the Legislative Assembly of Gandhi's home state of Gujarat prohibited the sale of this book through a resolution
 leliveld ke mutabik, unki pustak ke aadhaar par gandhi kii samalangi yaa dwillingi hone ke lagaae ja rahe aankalan galat hai
 He said, "this book does not say that Gandhi was gay or bisexual
 yah kahati he ki brahmacharee the, or calenbakh se gahare se jude the
 And this is not new information

 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return

 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct

" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa

 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time

 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion
 " Gandhi was anti-raj in the form where he had a vision of an India that was not under any government
 unka vichaar tha ki ek desh main sachche swashaasan kaa arth he ki pratyak vyakti khud par shashan karata hai tathaa koi aisa rajya nahin jo logon par kanoon lagu kar sake

 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons by Gandhari, of which Duryodhana was the eldest and Pandu had five sons like Yudhishthra, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva etc
 dhritarashtra janm se hi netraheen the, atah unki jagah par pandu ko raja banaaya gaya
 Once, while playing the game in the forest, a moth-headed mrigarupadhari sage died from the arrow of Pandu
 us rishi se shaapit ho ki "ab jab kabhi bhi tu maithunarat hoga to teri mrityu ho jaayegi", pandu atyant duhkhi hokar apni raniyon sahit samast vaasanaon kaa tyaag karke tathaa hastinapur main dhritarashtra ko apana kaa pratinidhi banaakar van main rahane lagen

 draupadi ke swayamvar ke samay duryodhana ke saath hi saath drupad,dhridhyumna evam anek anya logon ko andeh ho gaya tha ki ve paanch brahman pandav hi hai
 Hence, Drupada invited him to his kingdom to test him

 unke kriya-kalap se drupad ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ye brahmanon ke rup main pandav hi hai

 Indra was shocked to see the valor of his son Arjuna
 unhone khandavaprastha ke wanon ko hataa diya

 vah shahar ek dwitiya swarg ke samaan ho gaya
 At the behest of Indra, Dev Shilpi Vishwakarma and Maya Demon together built the Khandava forest into a grand city as Indrapuri, which was named Indraprastha

 Bhishma fought for ten days and killed most of the Pandava army with his arrows
 bhishma kii mrityu unki ichha ke adheen thi
 On the suggestion of Shri Krishna, the Pandavas asked Bhishma the remedy for his death
 bhishma ne kaha ki pandav shikhandi ko saamne karke yuddh lade
 Bhishma considered her to be a girl and after getting him in front, he was not going to wield weapons
 or shikhandi ko apane purv janm ke apmaan kaa badla bhi lenaa tha uske liye shivaji se vardaan bhi liya ki bhishma ki mrityu kaa kaaran banegi
 10 In the battle of the day, Arjuna placed Shikhandi on his chariot, and seeing Shikhandi in front, Bhishma gave up his bow and Arjuna with his sack put him to sleep on the bed of arrows

 But when Pandavo convinces Drona that Ashwatthama was killed
 to acharya dron ne niraash hon astr shastr tyagkar uske baad yoga samadhi le kar apana sharir tyaag diya

 Karna and Arjuna had a great war-like battle involving weapons and weapons, which was also going to defeat the devasur-sangram
 karn or arjuna ke sangram main karn ne apane baanon se shatru-paksh ke bahut-se veeron kaa sanhaar kar daalaa
 Although the war was getting stale, Karna got entangled when a wheel of his chariot got stuck in the earth
 guru parashuram ke shaap ke kaaran vah apane ko divine astron ke prayog main bhi asamarth paakar rath ke pahie ko nikaalane ke liye neeche utarataa he
 Then Krishna asks Arjuna to kill him by reminding him of the Abhimanyu slaughter, the prostitute and his vow to slay Karna at the Kuru Sabha, then Arjuna beheads Karna with a divine weapon
 tadnantar raja shalya kaurav-sena ke senapati hue, kintu ve yuddh main aadhe din tak hi tik sake
 King Yudhishthira killed him by noon
 duryodhana kii sari sena ke maare jane par ant main uskaa bhimsen ke saath gada yuddh hua
 Bhima slapped him on the thigh and killed him
 iskaa pratishodh lene ke liye ashwatthama ne raatri main pandavon kii ek akshuhinee sena, draupadi ke paanchon putron, uske paanchaladeshiy bandhuon tathaa dhridhyumna ko sadaa ke liye sula diya
 Then Arjuna defeated Ashwatthama and took out the gem of his head
 phir ashwatthama ne uttara ke garbh par brahmastra kaa prayog kiya
 His womb was often burnt by his weapon, but Lord Krishna gave him life again
 uttara kaa vahi garbhasth shishu aage chalakar raja parakshit ke naam se vikhyath hua
 At the end of this war, Kritavarma, Kripacharya and Ashwatthama, three Kauravapaksiyas and five Pandavas, Satyaki and Sri Krishna, these seven Pandavapakshiya heroes survived
 tatpashchaat yudhisthir rajsinghaasana par asin hue
 Yadavakul was killed due to the curse of Brahmins and Gandhari
 balbhadraji yoga se apana sharir tyaag kar sheshnag swarup hokar samudr main chale gayi
 One day, all the great-grandchildren of Lord Krishna, to see the power of the great men, made one a woman and went to the sages and asked, o Munishreshtha! This woman is from the womb, tell us who will be born from her womb? The sages came to know that this child had brought a man to them, making them a woman
 muniyon ne krishna ke prapautron ko shrapa ki is maanav ke garbh se ek moosal likalegaa jisase tumhaare vansh kaa ant hoga
 Krishna's great-grandchildren rubbed that pestle on a stone and threw it into the river and threw its tip
 us churna se utpann vriksh kii pattiyon se sabhi krishna ke praputra mrityu ko praapt kiye
 Seeing this, Shri Krishna also sat meditating under a tree
 'zaraa' naam ke ek vyaadh ne apane baan kii nok par moosal kaa nok laga diya tathaa bhagwaan krishna ke charankmal ko mrug samajhakar us baan se prahaar kiya
 The kiss of Krishna's feet by that arrow caused his paramdham to go
 prabhu apane sampurna sharir ke saath golok prasthaan kiye
 The sea then submerged Dwarkapuri in its waters
 tadnantar dwarka se laute hue arjuna ke mukh se yadavon ke sanhaar kaa samachar sunakar yudhisthir ne sansar kii anityata kaa vichaar karke parakshit ko rajasan par bithaaya or draupadi tathaa bhaaiyon ko saath le himalay kii taraf mahaprasthaan ke path par agrasar hue

 Kalki is considered to be the future incarnation of Vishnu
 puranakthaon ke anusaar kaliyug main paap kii seemaa paar hone par vishwa main dushton ke sanhaar ke liye kalki avatar prakat hoga
 The purpose of the incarnation of Lord Shree Kalki, the era transformer, is stated to be Vishwakalyan
 bhagwaan kaa yah avatar ‘‘nishkalank bhagwaan’’ ke naam se bhi janaa jaayegaa
 The stories of the incarnations of Vishnu are described in detail in the Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana
 iske barahawein skandh ke dwitiya adhyay main bhagwaan ke kalki avatar kii katha vistaar se di gai he jisamen yah kaha gaya he ki "sambhal gram main vishnuyash naamak shreshth brahman ke putr ke rup main bhagwaan kalki kaa janm hoga
 He will mount a horse named Devadatta and kill the wicked with his karla karwal only when the golden age will begin
 " Sambhal Village Chief Minister Brahmanasyamahatman: Bhavanevishnyashas: Kalki Pradurbhavishyati
 
 Lord Shri Kalki is an immortal avatar
 unke pita kaa naam vishnuyash or mata kaa naam sumati hoga
 His brothers who will be older than him will be named Sumant, Pragya and Kavi respectively
 yajyavalaky ji purohit or bhagwaan parashuram unke guru honge
 Lord Shri Kalki will have two wives - Padma in the form of Lakshmi and Rama in the form of Vaishnavi Shakti
 unke putr honge - jai, vijay, meghmal tathaa balaahak
 The nature of God is supreme and divine
 unke sparup kii kalpana unke param anugrah se hi kii ja sakati he
 Lord Shri Kalki is the eternal hero of the universe
 shakti purushottam bhagwaan shri kalki adwitiya hai
 Lord Shri Kalki is riding on the milk color ie white horse
 ashv kaa naam devdatt he
 The color of God is blond, but also black in anger
 bhagwaan pile vastra dhaaran kiye hai
 The sign of Shrivatsa is inscribed on the heart of the Lord
 gale main kaustubh mani sushobhit he
 God is east facing and horse is Dakshinamukh
 bhagwaan shri kalki ke vamang main lakshmi or daaen bhaag main vaishnavi virajman hai

 There are many categories of avatars mentioned in the texts, such as Ansashavatar, Anshvatar, Aveshvatar, Kalavatar, Nityavatar, Yugavatar
 jo bhi saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth ko vyakt karata he ve sabhi avatar kehalaate hai
 From the person to the highest level of the society, in order to express the universal truth-principles, various categories of avatars are leveled
 antim saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth ko vyakt karne vaala hi antim avatar ke rup main vyakt hoga
 The avatars, prophets, messengers, etc
, we have known till now, after their existence, during the period of their life or after their body sacrifice
 parantu bhavishya arthath aane vaale kal ke liye kalpit ek maatr mahavishnu ke 24 avtaron main 24vaan tathaa pramukh avtaron main dasavaan or antim kalki avatar ke vishay main jo pariklpana he, vah nimnlikhit rup se he- naam rup – 'kalki puraana' hinduon ke vibhinn dharmik evam puranic granthon main se ek he
 Like other incarnations of Vishnu, Kalki is not mentioned in the Vedas
 lekin puraanon main kalki avatar kaa vistaar se varnan hai
 Both Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana mention the Kalki avatar
 kalki puraana to puri tarah se isi avatar par kendrit hai
 According to almost all the Puranas, Kalki will be born at the home of a Brahmin Vishnu
 kalki bhagwan shiv ke bhakt honge or unke guru parashuram hongen
 In the Kalki Purana, the story of the birth and family of "kalki" incarnation is conceived as follows- "A Brahmin named Vishnuyash will reside in a village named Shambhal, who will marry a woman named Sumati, both will spend days in the religion
 kalki unke ghar main putr hokar janm lenge or alpaayu main hi vedadi shastron kaa paath karke mahapandit ho jaayenge
 Later, they will be overcome by the misery of the creatures and worship Mahadev and obtain astravidya who will be married to Padmadevi, the daughter of Brihadratha
 “ Just as it is impossible to determine the name of any person who is born in the future in general practical way, it is impossible to determine his parents, place of birth and wife
 dhyaan dene yogya yah he ki sabhi avatar, paigambar, ishdoot ityadi rajtantr vyavastha kaal main aaye the
 When the Kalki Purana was written there was a monarchical system, so the story of the future Kalki is completely in the same style as the story of other incarnations
 vishvaman ke ansh kii anubhuti kisi bhi vyakti se vyakt ho sakati he jiskaa prakshepan yaa prastutikaran us samay or vyakti kii apni samskruti ke madhyam se hi hota he
 Yet Kalki Katha also has some meaning
 sambhal- In the Kali Yuga of Kalki avatar being in the context of Hindustan, all Hindus agree, but there are many differences in where Sambhal is
 kuch vidwaan sambhal ko urisa, himalay, punjab, bengal or shankarpur main maanate hai
 Some consider Sambhal in China's cabbage desert where humans cannot reach
 kuch vrindavan main maanate hai
 Some consider Sambhal in Moradabad district where Kalki Avatar Temple is also there
 vichaarneey vishay ye he ki ”sambhal main kalki avatar hoga yaa jahaan kalki avatar hoga vahi sambhal hoga
 “sambhal literally means to be equally good or peace or peace, that is, where there is peace and peace or peace is spread
 kalki puraana main sambhal main 68 tirtho kaa vaas bataaya gaya he
 In Saliyug, only Sambhal will be the only pilgrimage place that will be a welfare and peacemaker
 tirth kaa arth- pavitra sthaan, darshan, dil, man, hriday, ghat, talab, pani kaa sthaan, amar jivan daata jal, logon ke aane jane or jamghat ke sthaan ke arth main hota he
 Brahmin father Vishnuyash and mother Sumati- According to the Kalki Purana, the name of the father and mother of the Kalki avatar will be Vishnuyash and Sumati, which dictates not the name but the qualities
 brahman arthath jo veda, puraana or shuddh param chaitanya ko jaanata ho
 Vishnu means God, the omnipresent God who is present in all places, the creator of the universe
 yash arthath stuti yaa prashansa karne vaala
 In this way, Father Vishnu's meaning is that of a father who is praising and praising the all-pervading God and is benevolent of all
 isi prakaar sumati kaa arth hota he- sundar yaa acha mat yaa vichaar rakhana
 Wife of Kalki Avatar - In Kalki Purana ”kalki“ avatar ke vishay main kaha gaya he ki- ”unka vivaah brihadrath kii putree padmadevi ke saath hoga
 "but according to the story based on the film displayed on Maa Vaishno Devi", a booklet sold in connection with the story of Vaishno Devi in katra and Jammu and Gulshan Kumar, "trikuta told Sriram - she accepted him as a husband
 Have done shriram ne use bataaya ki unhone is avatar main keval sita ke prati nishthavan rahane kaa vachan liya he lekin bhagwaan shriram ne use aashwaasan diya ki kaliyug main ve kalki ke rup main prakat hogen or usase vivaah karegein
 " shriramcharitamanas ke kiskindhakand main ek devi kaa varnan miltaa he
 He gave water and fruits to Hanumanji and other Banar Birs and took them out of the cave and brought them to the shore of the ocean
 ye devi swayamprabha hai
 This goddess is revered as Mother Vaishnav
 kalyug ke antim charan main bhagwaan kaa kalki avatar hoga
 Then these Kalki God will punish the wicked and establish religion on earth
 tathaa devi swayamprabha se shriramavatar main die gaye vachananusaar vivaah karenge
 That is, the Kalki avatar will be given to Vaishno Devi who has been in the body in the form of ages, which will be "mother Kalki Devi", the realization of "mother Vaishno Devi"
 sharir rup - Evidence of the incarnation is also found in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita composed by Maharishi Vyasa and the eighth incarnation of God, Shri Krishna
 yada-yada hi dharmasy glanirbhavatee bharatah
 Adyuthatanam Dharmasya Tadatmanam Srjamyaham
 
 That means India! The period when there is loss of religion and there is excess of unrighteousness
 us kaal main hi main apni aatma ko prakat karata hoon
 In this way, the body of Kalki avatar will be of human being, which will reveal the form of soul and will be Krishna form
 karm rup – kalki mahauvataar safed ghode par savaar hokar haath main talwaar lekar samast buraaiyon kaa naash karegein
 Symbols are used in any religious scriptures to represent ideas because there is no shape of thought
 is prakaar kalki avatar ke arth ko spasht karne par ham pate hai ki safed ghoda arthath shaanti kaa pratik yaa ahimsak maarg, talwaar arthath gyaan arthath saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth jisase sabhi kaa maansik vadh hoga
 If we take these symbols in the same form, then in today's era, how many people are possible to kill with a sword in the age of one science based weapon, that is, and how much physical strength will that person be, it is a matter of consideration? parinaam sirf ek he keval maansik vadh jo maatr saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth se hi sambhav he
 And religion has been established by past incarnations using physical and economic reasons
 kalki puraana katha rachanaakaar tab ye soch bhi nahin paye hogen ki bhavishya main drishy padaarth vigyaan aadhaarit drishy kaal or niraakaar samvidhan aadhaarit ek nai vyavastha bhi aa jaayegi or us vakt raja or rajtantr nahin hoga tab kalki avatar kiskaa vadh karegein? davy yaa vishwa rup - kalki avatar ke guno ke anusaar karm karne ke satya rup ko ek kadam badhaate huye tathaa anek karm ke pratik anek hatho vaala dikhaaya gaya he
 This makes it clear that one Karma will be accomplished by the Kalki avatar and because of that, karma will start with many hands, that is, they will be able to say that "I am doing karma with many hands and all are doing karma with my own Karmgyan
" 
 “ After the Gita, the scripture of universal truth knowledge, there is a need for universal karma, which is a phase of the work of Kalki avatar
 gyaan rup - antim saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth kaa gyaan hi antim avatar kaa gyaan rup hoga, jiske nimna kaaran hogen

 The three qualities of nature - Srimad, Raja, Tama, freeing and interviewing God, the scripture of "knowledge", Srimad Bhagavadgita or Gita or Geetopanishad "had become available, but after the interview, the knowledge of doing deeds means God's brain"
 The scripture of "karmigyan" was not available, that is, the scripture for interviewing God was available, but the scripture of the method of doing God was not available

 Guru of Kalki Avatar - kalki puraana ke anusaar ”bhagwaan parashuram, bhagwaan vishnu ke dasven avatar kalki ke guru hogen or unhen yuddh kii shiksha degen
 He is the one who will ask Kalki to obtain divine weapon by doing penance to Lord Shiva
 “ adrishy kaal ke vyaktigat pramanit kaal main vyaktigat pramanit adrishy prakritik chetana se yukt satya aadhaarit satyuga main chhathwein avatar – parashuram avatar tak anek asuri raajaaon dwaara rajyon kii sthapana ho chuki thi parinamswaroop aise paristhiti main ek purush kii aatma adrishy prakritik chetana dwaara nirmit paristhitiyon main praathamikta se vartmaan main kaary karnaa, main sthapit ho gayi or usne kai raajaaon kaa vadh kar daalaa or asuron tathaa devon ke sah-astitv se ek nai vyavastha kii sthapana kii
 Which was a new and good system
 isliye us purush ko kaalaantar main unke naam par parashuram avatar se janaa gaya tathaa vyavastha ”parashuram parampara“ ke naam se janaa gaya jo saakaar aadhaarit ”loktantr kaa janm“ tha, isi saakaar aadhaarit loktantr vyavastha ko shriram dwaara prasar hua tha or isi ke asafal ho jane par dwapar yug main shrikrishna ne mahabharat yuddh ke dwaara samaapt kar niraakaar loktantr vyavastha kii neenv daali thi ja bhagwaan budh dwaara majbootee paayi or vartmaan main niraakaar samvidhan aadhaarit loktantr saamne he
 Kalki will be the incarnation for the fulfillment of this system

 Kalki Avatar Temple - mahavishnu ke 24 avtaron main 24vaan tathaa pramukh avtaron main dasavaan or antim kalki avatar hi ek maatr aise avatar hai jinke avataran se purv hi siddhapithon main murtiya sthapit ho rahi he
 Likewise, wherever the incarnations of Vishnu are placed in the temple, there is also a projected statue of Kalki avatar along with other incarnations
 parantu vishesh rup se nimna sthanon par kalki bhagwaan kaa mandir nirmit he

 Where the Kalki avatar is to be held in Sambhal, the temple of Kalki God is built there

 main dakshinyan shikhar style main karaayaa tha
 According to Sanskrit scholar Acharya Devarshi Kalanath Shastri, Sawai Jai Singh has been the first Maharaja of the world who imagined a deity whose incarnation was not yet incarnated and built an idol of Lord Kalki and installed it in the temple
 savai jaisingh ke tatkaali darbari kavi shrikrishna bhatta ”kalanidhi“ ne apane ”kalki kavy“ main mandir ke nirmaan or auchity kaa varnan kiya he, tadnusaar aisa ullekh he ki savai jaisingh ne apane pautra ”kalki prasad“ jisaki asamay mrityu ho gai thi, uski smriti main mandir sthapit karaayaa

 The Triveni Sangam site of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat is a Hari temple in Sabla village of Dungarpur district of Wangar zone of Rajasthan where Kalki avatar is being worshiped
 hari mandir ke garbhagrih main shyaam rang kii ashwarudh nishkalank murti he, jo lakhon bhakton kii shraddha or vishwaas kaa centre he
 This amazing idol of the unblemished God, the future incarnation of God, is on horseback
 is ghode ke teen pair bhoomi par tike hue hai jabaki ek pair sataha se thodaa unchaa he
 It is believed that this foot is slowly bending towards the ground
 jab yah pair puri tarah jameen par tik jayega tab duniya main parivartan kaa daur aarambh ho jayega
 It is explained in the texts and speech composed by Sant Mavji
 yahaan baqayada kai mandir bane hue hai, jinamein vishnu ke bhavi avatar kalki kii murtiyon sthapit hai or inaki rojaanaa puja-archana bhi hoti he
 The followers of Saint Mavji Maharaj have been waiting for this future incarnation for more than three hundred years
 sant maavji maharaj lakhon logon kii aasthaaon se jude beneshwar dham ke aadya peethadhishwar rahe hai
 Devotees believe that the deity they are worshiping will incarnate as Kalki avatar of Lord Vishnu in the Kali Yuga and will save the earth
 inhen nishkalank avatar ke upaask hone se sant maavji ke bhakt apane upasya ko priy aisi hi shwet vesh-bhusha dhaaran karte hai
 Prayers of the same nature continue in the Nirchalka sect including the World Peetha Hari temple, in the Vagad region and in the Nishlank Dhams established in different parts of the country
 desh ke vibhinn hisson main faile lakhon maav bhakton dwaara apane upasya ke rup main inhen nishkalank bhagwaan kaa pujan-archan kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The various Nishkalak Dham are in the form of a temple, while the Vishwa Peetha Hari Temple of the Nishkalak Sampradaya has neither a dome nor a temple fire, but it remains in its ancient style as the Guru Ashram
 nishkalank sampradaay ke mandir saabala, punjpur, vamasa, paloda, sheshpur, bansawada, fatehpura, ghughara, parda, itivaar, santarampur aadi gaanvon main avasthit hai
 All these temples have quadrangular idols of the unblemished God, a future incarnation riding on a white horse, including conch, chakra, mace, padma
 maavji kii putravadhu jankunwari ne hi beneshwar dham par sarvadharm sambhaav ke pratik vishnu mandir kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 It is clearly stated in Mavji's speech - Sab Devan's camp rises, Niklanka's camp Rahese, that is, the temple, mosque, church, etc
 will all be broken, but there will be a temple of the immortal God who incarnates in Kali Yuga where all religions People will get shelter
 sabhi log ise prem se apana maanenge
