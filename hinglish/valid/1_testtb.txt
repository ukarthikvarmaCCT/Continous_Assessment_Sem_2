 vahiin ek rishi ne unhen nal or damyanti kii katha sunaayi
 Nal Nishad was the king of the country
 ve virasen ke putr the
 Nal was very brave and beautiful
 shastr-vidya tathaa ashv-sanchaalan main ve nipun the
 Damayanti was the only daughter of the King of Vidarbha
 vah bhi bahut sundar or gunwan thi
 Nal began to love her after listening to her beauty
 unke prem kaa sandesh damyanti ke paas badi kushalta se pahunchaaya ek hans ne
 And Damayanti also started burning in the face of her unknown lover
 is katha main prem or pidaa kaa aisa prabhaavshaalee put he ki bharat ke hi nahin desh-videsh ke lekhak va kavi bhi isse aakarshith hue bina na rah sake
 By translating Bop into Latin and into English poetry by Dean Milman, the West has also been well acquainted with this tale
 vidarbha desh main bhismak naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 His daughter's name was Damayanti
 damyanti lakshmi ke samaan rupavati thi
 At the same time, Nishal's son Nils ruled in Nishad country
 ve bade hi gunavan, satyawadee tathaa brahman bhakt the
 Those who came from the country of Nishad to Vidarbha praised the qualities of Maharaj Nal
 yah prashansa damyanti ke kaanon tak bhi pahaunchi thi
 Similarly, people coming from Vidarbha country would discuss the form and qualities of princess in front of Maharaj Nal
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki nal or damyanti ek-duusare ke prati aakrisht hote gayi
 In the Mahabharata, on the insistence of Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, Maharishi Brihadeva told the story of nal-damayanti
 dharmraj ! nishadh desh main virasen ke putr nal naam ke ek raja ho chuke hai
 He was very talented, supremely beautiful, truthful, Jitendriya, beloved of all, Vedas and Brahmin devotees
 unki sena bahut badi thi
 
 ve swayan astravidya main bahut nipun the
 They were brave, warrior, benevolent and irresistibly valiant too
 unhen jua khilne kaa bhi kuch-kuch shauk tha
 In those days, a king named Bhima ruled the country of Vidarbha
 ve bhi nal ke samaan hi sarvagun sampann or parakramee the
 He pleased the sage Daman and received four children from his boon — three sons and a daughter
 putron ke naam the—dam, dant, or daman
 The daughter's name was Damayanti
 damyanti lakshmi ke samaan rupavati thi
 His eyes were huge
 devataaon or yakshon main bhi waisi sundari kanya kahin dekhne main nahin aati thi
 In those days, how many people would come from Vidarbha country to Nishad country and would tell the form and quality of Damayanti in front of King Nal
 nishadh desh se vidarbha main jane vaale bhi damyanti ke saamne raja nal ke rup, gun or pavitra charitra kaa varnan karte
 Thus, mutual affection sprouted in both of their hearts
 ek din raja nal ne apane mahal ke udyaan main kuch hanson ko dekha
 They caught a goose
 hans ne kaha—‘aap mujhe chhod dijiye to ham log damyanti ke paas jaakar aapke gunon kaa aisa varnan karenge ki vah aapako avashya var legi
 'nal gave up laughing
 ve sab udakar vidarbha desh main gayi
 Damayanti was very happy to see her swans and started running towards them to catch the swans
 damyanti jis hans ko pakadaney ke liye daudti, vahi bol uthta ki ‘ari damyanti ! nishadh desh main ek nal naam kaa raja he
 She is as handsome as Ashwini Kumar
 manushyon main uske samaan sundar or koi nahin he
 It is as if idol is Cupid
 yadi tum uski patni ho jaao to tumhaara janm or rup donon safal ho jaayan
 We have seen the gods, gandharvas, humans, snakes and demons roaming around like a tap, but a beautiful man could not be seen
 jaise tum striyon main ratna ho, vaise hi nal purushon main bhushan he
 The pair of you two will be very beautiful
 ’ damyanti ne kaha—‘hans ! tum nal se bhi aisi baat kahana
 'hans returned to Nishad country and told the message of Damayanti from the tap
 damyanti hans ke munh se raja nal kii kirti sunakar unase prem karne lagi
 Her attachment grew so much that she would keep paying attention to them day and night
 sharir dhoomil or dublaa ho gaya
 She started looking down sakhiyon ne damyanti ke hriday kaa bhav tadkar vidarbharaj se nivedan kiya ki ‘aapaki putree aswasth ho gayi he
 'king Bhima thought big about his daughter
 ant main vah is nirnay par pahunche ki meri putree vivaahyogy ho gayi he, isaliye iskaa swayamvar kar dena chaiye
 He sent a invitation letter to the swayamvara to all the kings and informed them that the kings should take advantage by visiting the swayamvara of Damayanti and fulfill my desire
 desh-desh ke narpathi hathi, ghode or rathon kii dhwani se prithvi ko mukherit karte hue saj-dhajkar vidarbha desh main pahunchne lage
 Bhima made proper arrangements to welcome everyone
 devarshi naarad or parvat ke dwaara devataaon ko bhi damyanti ke swayamvar kaa samachar mil gaya
 All the Lokpal, including Indra, also left for Vidarbha country with their congregation and vehicles
 raja nal kaa chitt pehle se hi damyanti par aasakt ho chukaa tha
 He also traveled to Vidarbha country to join Damayanti's Swayamvara
 devataaon ne swarg se utarate samay dekh liya ki kaamdev ke samaan sundar nal damyanti ke swayamvar ke liye ja rahe hai
 Like the sun of the tap, the deities too were amazed by the Kanti and extraterrestrial appearance
 unhone pahichaan liya ki ye nal hai
 He parked his planes in the sky and came down and said to the tap - 'rajendra Nal! You are very Satyavrati
 aap ham logon kii sahaayta karne ke liye doot ban jaaiye
 'nal pledged and said' i will '
 phir poocha ki ‘aap log koun hai or mujhe doot banaakar koun-sa kaam lenaa chaahate hai ?’ indra ne kaha—‘humlog devtaa hai
 i am Indra and these are Agni, Varuna and Yama
 ham log damyanti ke liye yahan aaye hai
 The Gods told Nal that you should become our messenger and go to Damayanti and say that Indra, Varuna, Agni and Yamdevata want to come to you and marry you
 inamen se tum chaahe jis devtaa ko pati ke rup main sweekaar kar lo
 Nal said with both hands that 'devraj'! There is only one purpose for you and me to leave
 isaliye aap mujhe doot banaakar vahaan bhejein, yah uchit nahin he
 Whoever has a desire to get a woman as a wife, how can he leave her and go to her and say such a thing? You guys please forgive me about this damyanti kaa swayamvar hua jisamen na keval dharti ke raja, balki devtaa bhi nal kaa rup dharkar aa gaye
 The swayamvara had several taps standing simultaneously
 sabhi pareshaan the ki asli nal koun hoga
 But Damayanti was not deterred at all
 usne ankhon se hi asli nal ko pahchaan liya
 All the gods also greeted him
 is tarah ankhon main jhalkate bhaavon se hi damayanti ne asli nal ko pahachaanakar apana jeevanasathi chun liya
 The newly-married couple received the blessings of the gods
 damyanti nishadh-naresh raja nal kii maharani bani
 Both started spending time happily
 damyanti pativrataaon main shiromani thi
 Pride could never touch her
 samyaanusaar damyanti ke garbh se ek putr or ek kanya kaa janm hua
 Both children were blessed with beautiful looks and qualities as per their parents
 samay sadaa ek-sa nahin rahata, dukh-sukh kaa chakra nirantar chalata hi rahata he
 Though Maharaja was a man of tap quality, godliness and virtue, but there was a flaw in him - addiction to gambling
 nal ke ek bhai kaa naam pushkar tha
 He lived separately from the tap
 usne unhen jue ke liye aamantrit kiya
 The game started
 bhagya pratikul tha
 Nal started losing, gold, silver, chariot, Rajpat all got out of hand
 maharani damyanti ne pratikul samay jaanakar apane donon bacchon ko vidarbha desh kii rajdhani kundinpur bhej diya
 Here, he lost his everything in null gambling
 unhone apane sharir ke saare vastrabhushan utaar diye
 Came out of the city wearing only a garment
 damyanti ne bhi maatr ek sari main pati kaa anusaran kiya
 One day King Nal saw some birds with gold wings
 raja nal ne sochaa, yadi inhen pakad liya jaay to inako bechakar nirvaah karne ke liye kuch dhan kamaaya ja saktaa he
 Thinking this, he opened his clothes and threw them on the birds
 pakshi vah vastra lekar ud gayi
 Now Raja Nal was left with no clothes even to cover his body
 nal apni apeksha damyanti ke dukh se adhik vyakul the
 One day both of them were hiding under the same cloth under a tree in the forest
 damyanti ko thakaavat ke kaaran neend aa gayi
 King Nal thought, Damayanti has to bear great grief because of me
 yadi main ise isi avasthaa main yaheen chhodkar chal don to yah kisi tarah apane pitaake paas pahunch jaaygi
 Considering this, he cut half of her sari with a sword, and by covering her body with it and leaving Damayanti in the same state, they left
 jab damyanti kii neend tuuti to bechaari apane ko akelaa paakar karun vilaap karne lagi
 Disturbed by hunger and thirst, she suddenly went to the dragon and the dragon swallowed it
 damyanti kii cheekh sunakar ek vyaadh ne use ajgar kaa grass hone se bachaaya
 But the hunter was evil by nature
 usne damyanti ke soundarya par mugdh hokar use apni kaam-pipaasa kaa shikaar bananaa chaha
 Damayanti said while cursing him- 'if i have never thought of any other man except my husband King Nal, then the life of this sinful hunter should be ended now
 damyanti kii baat puri hote hi vyaadh mrityu ko praapt hua
 While wandering deviously, Damayanti reached Chedinresh Subahu one day and then to her father
 antat damyanti ke satitv ke prabhaav se ek din maharaj nal ke duhkho kaa bhi ant hua
 The two were reunited and Raja Nal also regained his kingdom
 nal va damyanti ke do judwa putr namah va dalh the

 Syedism is the relative principle of understanding, explaining and expressing the qualities of an object under Jain philosophy
 jain matanusaar kisi bhi vastu ke anant gun hote hai
 It is only possible for a seeker who is free or Kaivalya to know the eternal qualities
 saadhaaran manushyon kaa gyaan aanshik or saapeksh hota he
 This partial knowledge of the object is called new in Jain philosophy
 nay kisi bhi vastu ko samajhane ke vibhinn drushtikon hai
 These are called partial forms of new truth
 aanshik or saapeksh gyaan se saapeksh satya kii prapti hi sambhav he, nirpeksh satya kii prapti nahin
 Due to the attainment of relative truth, the decision of an ordinary person in relation to anything cannot be true in all respects
 logon ke bich matbhed rahane kaa kaaran yah he ki vah apane vichaaron ko nitant satya maanane lagate hai or duusare ke vichaaron kii upeksha karte hai
 In order to express ideas logically and to show the importance of the relativity of knowledge, Jain philosophy has proposed the principle of Syedvad or Saptabhangi Nay
 saapekshik gyaan kaa bodh karaane ke liye jain darshan main prayek nay ke aarambh main syat shavd ke prayog kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he
 It should be noted here that 'syat' does not mean 'perhaps'
 jainiyon ne iskaa udhaaharan ek hathi or chah netraheen vyaktiyon ke madhyam se diya he
 All blind provide a sense of the availability of knowledge and the extent of access to it
 yadi koi hathi ko simit anubhav ke aadhaar par kahe ki hathi khambhe, rassi, diwaar, ajgar yaa pankhe jaisaa bataaye to vah uske aanshik gyaan or saapeksh satya ko hi vyakt karata he
 If the word 'syat' is added to this experience, the vote is considered flawless
 arthath, yadi kaha jaay ki- 'syat hathi khambhe yaa rassi ke samaan he' to mat taarkik rup se sahi mana jaayga
 There are seven types of judgments or judgments in Jain philosophy based on the rationality of relative knowledge
 jain darshan dwaara anubhavik nirnay yaa mat ke is vargeekaran ko hi saptabhangi nay kaha jaataa he
 This is the first opinion
 udhaaharan ke taur par yadi kaha jaay ki 'syat hathi khambhe jaisaa he' to uskaa arth hoga ki kisi vishesh desh, kaal or paristhiti main hathi khambhe jaisaa he
 This opinion is emotional
 yah ek abhavatmak mat he
 In this perspective, there should be a view of elephants in such a way that a black elephant is not inside this room
 iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kamare main koi hathi nahin he
 The word Syatam makes sense of the fact that elephant of particular form, color, shape and type is not within this room
 jiske bodh main hathi diwaar yaa rassi kii tarah he uske liye abhavatmak mat ke rup main is nay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Syat word signifies the elephant who is not present in the room at the time of vote
 is mat kaa arth he ki vastu kii satta kisi vishesh drushtikon se ho bhi sakati he or nahin bhi
 Keeping the example of an elephant in mind, it may or may not be like a pillar
 aisi paristhitiyon main 'syat he or syat nahin he' kaa hi prayog ho saktaa he
 If one has to think together about conflicting qualities in one opinion, then the subject of the subject is used

 bhashavigyaan bhashaa ke adhyayan kii vah shakha he jisamen bhashaa kii utpatti, swaroop, vikaas aadi kaa vaigyanik evam vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics scholars are called 'philologists'
 bhashavigyaan, vyakaran se bhinn he
 Functional study of a language is done in grammar while the linguist goes on to do a very comprehensive study of the language
 adhyayan ke anek vishyon main se aajkal bhashaa-vigyaan ko vishesh mahatva diya ja rahaa he
 This language-related study has been named in Europe with many names and nouns till date
 sarvapratham is adhyayan ko philology shabd ke aage visheshan ke rup main ek shabd joda gaya- tab ise ‘‘comparative philology’’ kah kar pukaara gaya
 Until the nineteenth century, grammar and linguistic studies were often considered to be the same
 atah ise vidwaanon ne 'comparative grammer' naam bhi diya
 In France it was named Langistić
 france main bhashaa sambandhi kaary adhik hone ke kaaran unnisvin sadi main sampoorn europe main hi "linguistique" athwa "linguistics" naam hi prachlit rahaa he
 Apart from this, other names like 'science of Language', 'glutology' etc
 also came in handy to reveal this subject
 aaj in sabhi naamon main se ‘‘linguisticks’’, ‘‘philology’’ maatr hi prayog main laae jate hai
 In addition to all these European names in India, the names which are used in Hindi language are as follows - "bhasha-shastra", "bhasha-tattva", "bhasha-sasti", and "" Comparative linguistics "etc
 in sabhi naamon main se sarv prachlit naam ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ he
 All the names, ancient and new, appear to be synonymous in these names
 atah yahi naam is shaastra ke liye sarvatha upyukt prathit hota he
 In its present form, linguistics is said to be the brain of Western scholars
 ati pracheen kaal se hi bhashaa-sambandhi adhyayan kii pravriti sanskrit-sahitya main pai jaati he
 a subtle discussion on language is available in Vedang called 'shiksha'
 dhvaniyon ke uccharan- avyav, sthaan, praytn aadi kaa in granthon main vistrut varnan uplabdh he
 Scientific analysis can be called scientific study of the language on the subjects' etymology, metal, prefix-suffixes etc
 in 'pratishyakhya' and Nirukta
 bhartruhari ke granth ‘vaakya padiya’ ke antargat ‘shabd’ ke swaroop kaa sookshm, gahan evam vyapak chintan uplabdh hota he
 There the word is envisaged as 'brahman' and its 'letter' is described as a noun
 prakaaraantar se yah ek bhashaa-adhyayan sambandhi granth hi he
 In Sanskrit literature, even in philosophical and literary texts, we get indications of language scientific discussions only under the subtle interpretation of the words' meaning ',' rasa ',' bhava ',' language available here and there in Sanskrit literature
 -conceptual material can certainly be called the cornerstone of current linguistics
 aadhunik vishay ke rup main bhashaa-vigyaan kaa sutarapaat europe main san 1786 i0 main sar wiliam jones naamak vidwaan dwaara kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 In the context of the study of Sanskrit language, Sir William Jones had first done a comparative study of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin language and expressed the possibility that at least one of the languages forms the basis of these three languages
 atah in teenon bhashaaon ke bich ek sookshm sambandh sutara avashya vidyaman he
 This type of comparative study of languages became the first step in the field of modern linguistics
 ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ naam main do padon kaa prayog hua he
 "language" and "science"
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko samajhane se purv in donon shabdon se parichit hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The word 'bhasha' is derived from the Sanskrit "bhash" metal
 jiskaa arth he-vyakt vaak 
 The word 'science' is formed by applying the prefix 'v' and 'lute' from the 'known' metal
 saamaanya rup se ‘bhashaa’ kaa arth he ‘bol chaal kii bhashaa yaa boli’ tathaa ‘vigyaan’ kaa arth he ‘vishesh gyaan’, kintu ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ shabd main prayukt in donon padon kaa spasht or vyapak arth samaj lene par hi ham is naam kii sargarbhitako jaanane main safal honge
 So, here we try to explain the broad meaning of both these terms
 bhashahmanav ek saamaajik praani he
 The need to convey our feelings and thoughts to each other in the society has been felt since time immemorial
 is prakaar bhashaa kaa astitva maanav samaaj main ati pracheen siddh hota he
 Language serves as an important tool for publishing the entire knowledge of human beings, to know the history of civilization and culture
 hamaare purvapurushon se sabhi saadhaaran or asaadhaaran anubhav ham bhashaa ke madhyam se hi jaan sake hai
 Knowledge from all our scriptures and scriptures is dependent on language
 mahakavi dandi ne apane mahaan granth ‘kavyadarsh’ main bhashaa kii mahatta suchit karte hue likhaa haih- That is, this entire Bhuvan would have become dark, if the word-form light in the world was not the light of language
 spasht hi he ki yah kathan maanav bhashaa ko lakshya karke hi kaha gaya he
 The sounds that animals and birds take shelter to express their expressions may be language for them, but due to being ambiguous to humans, scholars have called it 'latent speech', which is language- Nothing matters from the point of view of science
 kyonki ‘avyakt vaak’ main shabd or arth donon hi aspasht bane rahete hai
 Humans also sometimes use signs of limbs, fidgeting, hand-to-feet, face etc
 to express their feelings, but in spite of being a language, it is not 'express speech'
 maanav bhashaa kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah ‘vyakt vaak’ arthath shabd or arth kii spashtataa liye hue hoti he
 According to Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, 'express speech' refers to the descriptive language
 yah satya he ki kabhi-kabhi sanketon or angabhangimaaon kii sahaayta se bhi hamaare bhav or vichaaron kaa preshan badi saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this way, those gestures become symbols of language, but the most appropriate means of expressing human emotion is the descriptive language which has been given the noun of 'express speech'
 is main vibhinn arthon ko prakat karne ke liye kuch nischit uccharit yaa kathith dhvaniyon kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 Therefore, language is called a group of words which are filled with signs of different meanings
 jinke dwaara ham apane manobhaav saralata se dusron ke prati prakat kar sakate hai
 Thus, while defining the language, we can call it a medium adopted to exchange thoughts and expressions in human society, which holds the meaningful basis for the sounds that have been effortlessly ejected from the utterances of humans
 wo dhwani-samooh shabd kaa rup tab lete hai jab ve kisi arth se jud jate hai
 Entire phonology is based on a 'random' relationship with its meaning
 ‘yadrichhik’ kaa arth he purnataya kalpit
 In short, we call that word group pronounced with different meanings expressed in different meanings through which we convey our feelings and thoughts to others
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan se hamen anek laabh hote hai, jaise- 1

 bhashaa, lipi aadi main saralata, shuddhta aadi kii drushti se parivartan-parivardhan main sahaayta
 In view of all these benefits, linguistics is considered to be a very useful subject in today's age and its field of study is constantly developing
 bhashaa ek prakritik vastu he jo maanav ko ishwariya vardaan ke rup main mili hui he
 Language is formed by naturally sounding sounds from the mouth of man
 bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan iske bolne or sunne vaale sabhi ko ho jaataa he
 This is called general knowledge of language
 iske aage, bhashaa kab bani, kaise bani ? iskaa praarambhik evam pracheen swaroop kya tha ? isamen kab-kab, kya-kya parivartan hue or un parivartanon ke kya kaaran hai ? athwa kul milakar bhashaa kaise viksit hui ? us vikaas ke kya kaaran hai ? koun si bhashaa kis duusari bhashaa se kitni samanta yaa vishmata rakhti he ? yah sab bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan yaa ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ kaha jayega
 This particular form of linguistics, ie linguistics, has been considered as an important subject of study today
 bhashaa-vigyaan jab adhyayan ke vishyon main badi-badi kakshaon ke paathyakramon ke antargat sammilit kiya gaya to sarvapratham yah ek swaabhaavik prashn utpann hua ki bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala ke antargat gina jaae yaa vigyaan main
 That is, linguistics is art or science
 adhyayan kii prakriya evam nishkarshon ko lekar nishchay kiya jane laga ki vastutah use bhautik vigyaan, evam rasayan vigyaan aadi kii bhanti vishuddh vigyaan mana jaae athwa chitra, sangeet, murti, kavy aadi kalaon kii bhanti kala ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaae
 Art is related to human beings objects or subjects
 yahi kaaran he ki kala vyakti pradhan yaa purnatah vaiyaktik hoti he
 Apart from being relative, a particular country and period also have an influence on art
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki kisi kaal main kala ke prati jo mulya rahete hai unamem kaalaantar main naye-naye parivartan upasthit ho jate hai tathaa ve kisi duusare desh main bhi maan liye jaaen, yah bhi aavashyak nahin he
 a person is feeling high artistic expression in an object
 kintu duusare ko vah is prakaar kii na lag rahi ho
 Therefore, the perception of art varies from person to person
 kala kaa sambandh maanav hriday kii ragatmik vritti se hota he
 There is a mixture of aesthetics of the person in it
 kala kaa uddeshy bhi soundaryanubhuti karana, yaa anand pradaan karnaa he, kisi vastu kaa tathvik vishleshan karnaa nahin
 The test of all these characteristics of the nature of art shows that linguistics is not art
 kyonki uskaa sambandh hriday kii sarasata-vritti se na hokar buddhi kii tatvagrahi drushti se hota he
 The aim of linguistics is not to provide beauty or entertainment
 vah to hamaare bauddhik chintan ko prakhar banaata he
 Elemental assessment of the existence of language
 uskaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 The findings of linguistics do not change on the basis of any person, nation or period and the basic basis of the study of linguistics, which is language, is not a humanized substance
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham kala ke kshetra main nahin gin sakate
 The usefulness of linguistics is that it teaches the art of language teaching
 isi kaaran sweet ne vyakaran ko bhashaa ko kala tathaa vigyaan donon kaha he
 Pure pronunciation, effective use of language can be placed in the category of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala kii seemaa main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, yah nishchay ho jane par yah prashn uthta he ki kya bhashaa-vigyaan, bhautik-shaastra, rasayan-vigyaan aadi vishyon kii bhanti purnatah vigyaan he ? In the belief of many scholars, linguistics is not a pure science
 unki dharna ke anusaar abhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi prayog purnataa ko praapt nahin hue hai or uske nishkarshon ko isiilie antim nishkarsh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 At the same time, not all conclusions of linguistics are as universal and eternal as science
 jis prakaar ganit shaastra main 2 + 2 = 4 saarvkalik, vikalparahit nishkarsh he jo sarvatra sweekaar kiya jaataa he, bhashaa-vigyaan ke paas is prakaar ke vikalp-rahit nirvivaad nishkarsh nahin he
 In science, facts are compiled and analyzed, and the laws of sound are mostly non-committal, so according to some scholars, linguistics can be placed between humanities and science
 vichaar karne par ham dekhte hai ki vigyaan kii aaj kii durat pragati main prayek vishesh gyaan apane aagaamee gyaan ke saamne purana or avaigyanik siddh hota ja rahaa he
 In today's era of continual innovators, the scientific view is constantly going from micro to micro and new to new
 aaj ke viksit gyaan-kshetra ko dekhte hue kai vaigyanik manyataayen puraani or feeki pad gai he
 Newton's theory of light is also now being viewed with suspicion
 isse yah siddh hota ho jaataa he ki nutan gyaan ke prakaash main puraatan gyaan bhi vigyaan ke kshetra se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Therefore, considering it from the point of view of pure knowledge, we find linguistics within the range of science itself
 bhashaa-vigyaan nishchay hi ek vigyaan he jiske antargat ham bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan praapt karte hai
 It is true that linguistics has not yet been fully developed on a scientific level
 yahi kaaran he ki prasiddh grim-niyam ke aage chal kar grassmaan or varnor ko usamen sudhaar karnaa padaa he
 Prior to the above reforms, the sound rule of Grimm was considered to be the definite rule and even after the reforms it is considered to be the definite rule
 is prakaar naye gyaan ke prakaash main puraane siddhanton kaa khandan hone se vigyaan kaa koi virodh nahin he
 Actually this is pure science
 san 1930 ke baad jahaan varnanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan ko punah mahatva praapt hua, vahaan tab se lekar aaj tak drut gati main vikaas hua he
 Ever since new tests have started with the help of instruments in the field of sound and the conclusions obtained have started to be completely regular, since then linguistics has gradually started to be considered in the category of science
 vigyaan kii ek badi visheshta he uskaa prayogtmak hona
 After American scholar Baloom Field, American linguists have developed experimental linguistics with great intensity as a new method of linguistics with phonology and morphology etc
 is paddati ke antargat bhashaa-vigyaan prayogshaalaon kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he or uske liye anek yantron kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 Seeing this, this subject will definitely be called science, there is no doubt in it at all
 aajkal jabaki samaaj-vigyaan, manovigyaan aadi shastreey vishyon ke liye jahaan vigyaan shabd kaa prayog karne kii parampara chal padi he tab shuddh kaaran-kaary parampara par aadhaarit bhashaa-vigyaan ko vigyaan kahana kisi bhi drushti se anuchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has written in his book Language Secret- mangal dev shastri ke shabdon main- This definition is given in Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari's 'linguistics' text as follows- upar di gai sabhi paribhaashaon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki unamem paraspar koi antar nahin he
 In the definition of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, where the focus has been on linguistics only, Mangaldev Shastri and Bholanath Tiwari have included the types of study of linguistics in their definitions
 paribhaasha vah acchhee hoti he jo sankshipt ho or spasht ho
 Thus, we can give a new definition of linguistics in this way - "the study by which the study of human languages is subtle and analytical is called linguistics
" ” In other words, linguistics is that in which subtle and extensive scientific study of human languages is done
 bhashaa ke prachlit vartmaan swaroop ko chhod kar shesh sari adhyayan saamagree bhashaa-vigyaan ko sahitya se hi uplabdh hoti he
 If Sanskrit, Greek and Avesta literature were not in front of us today, linguistics would never have been successful in knowing that these three languages originated from any one native language
 isi prakaar adikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kaa hindi sahitya hamaare saamne na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan hindi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan kis prakaar kar paata
 Linguistics to study language in any way, he has to take help of literature on foot
 bundelkhand ke natkhat baalkon ke munh se yah sun kar- The grammar says what a problem this is, only the study of ancient literature will tell him that this is the impaired form of the first sutra of Shaktayan, 'un Namah Siddham'
 sahitya bhi bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se apni anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane main safal ho jaataa he
 Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has clarified their meanings by linking many words of 'padmavat' with their original forms, validated on the basis of linguistic principles
 saath hi shuddh paath ke nirdhaaran main bhi isse paryaapt sahaayta lee he
 Hence, both literature and linguistics are supportive of each other
 bhashaa hamaare bhaavon-vichaaron arthath man kaa pratibimb hoti he atah bhashaa kii sahaayta se bahut se samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Economics in particular is completely based on psychology
 vaakya-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bhi manovigyaan se paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes psychology also helps us to know the cause of sound changes
 bhashaa kii utpatti tathaa praarambhik rup kii jaankaree main bhi bal-manovigyaan tathaa aviksit logon kaa manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Psychology also has to seek help from linguistics in its medical practice to know the meaning of the patient
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se ek manovigyaani rogi kii manogranthiyon kaa pataa lagane main safal ho saktaa he
 Due to the close relationship between linguistics and psychology, a new study method is being developed nowadays called Language Psychology or Psycholinguistics
 bhashaa mukh se nikalne vaali dhwani ko kehete hai atah bhashaa-vigyaan main hawa bheetar se kaise chalati he, swaryantr, swartantri, nasikavivar, kauwa, taalu, daant, jeebh, onth, kanth, moorddha tathaa naak ke kaaran usamen kya parivartan hote hai tathaa kaan dwaara kaise dhwani grahan kii jaati he, in sabakaa adhyayan karnaa padataa he
 Physiology only helps him in this
 likhit bhashaa kaa grahan aankh dwaara hota he or is prakriya kaa adhyayan bhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat hi hota he
 For this also he has to be indebted to physiology
 bhashaa-vigyaan or bhugol kaa bhi-gaharaa sambandh he
 According to some people, the geographical conditions of a place have a profound influence on its language
 kisi sthaan main boli jane vaali bhashaa main vahaan ke ped-paudhe, pakshi, jeev-jantu evam ann aadi ke liye shabd avashya milte hai parantu yadi unamem se kisi kii samaapti ho jaae to uskaa naam vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi juda ho jaataa hai
 The word 'somlata' is not used in our language today
 is lop kaa kaaran sambhavtah bhugolic hi he
 Geographic conditions are also the result of lack of a language spread in a place, less development in language and many dialects in a place
 durgam parvaton par rahane vaali jatiyon kaa paraspar kam sampark hone ke kaaran unki boli prasar nahin kar paati
 The dialect of people living across rivers differs from the common language
 deshon, nagaron, nadiyon tathaa praanton aadi ke naamon kaa bhashaa-vaigyanik adhyayan karne main bhugol badi manoranjak saamagree pradaan karata he
 Even in the field of economics, geography helps linguistics
 ‘ushtr’ kaa arth bhainsa se oont kaise ho gaya tathaa ‘saindhav’ kaa arth ghoda or namak hi kyon hua, aadi samasyaon par vichaar karne main bhi bhugol sahaayta karata he
 language-geography, a branch of linguistics, is just like geography
 isi prakaar kisi sthaan ke pragautihaasik kaal ke bhugol kaa adhyayan karne main bhashaa-vigyaan bhi paryaapt sahaayak hota he
 History is also closely related to linguistics
 itihaas ke teen roopon raajnneetik itihaas, dharmik itihaas, saamaajik itihaas-ko lekar yahan bhashaa-vigyaan se uskaa sambandh dikhalaayaa ja rahaa he- Other areas of knowledge like logic, physics and anthropology also provide great help in the study of linguistics
 manushya main anek prakaar ke andhvishwaas ghar kar lete hai jinka uski bhashaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In Indian society, women take their husbands' names in a twisted way, not outright
 raatri main vishaal keedon kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he
 They name their boy Mange, Chedi, Bechu, Ghurahu, Katwaru Alichar or Lendha, etc
 andhvishwaason ke atirikt anya bahut si saamaajik-manovigyaan se sambaddh gutthiyon ke spashtikaran ke liye maanav-vigyaan kii shakha-prashakhaon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 In this way, many fields of knowledge- culture-studies, pedagogy, statistics, text-science, etc
 have a deep connection with linguistics
 maanav kii bhashaa kaa jo kshetra he vahi bhashaa-vigyaan kaa kshetra he
 The languages and dialects of civilized and uncivilized humans around the world are studied under linguistics
 is prakaar bhashaa-vigyaan keval sabhy-saahitiyik bhashaaon kaa hi adhyayan nahin karata apitu asabhy-barbar-asaahitiyik boliyon kaa, jo prachlan main nahin he, ateet ke garv main khoi hui hai un bhashaaon kaa bhi adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 Linguistics is divided into language structure and 'study of meaning' from the point of view of subject division
 isamen bhashaa kaa vaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan or varnan karne ke saath hi vibhinn bhashaaon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics has two sides - elemental and applied
 iske atirikt bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan-vigyaan kii anyaanya shakhaon ke saath gaharaa sambandh he
 This has led to the development of various branches of sociolinguistics, psychodynamics, academic linguistics, etc
 bhashavigyaan ke gaun kshetra nimnlikhit hai- Syntax: In language, all thought-exchange is done on the basis of sentences
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke jis vibhaag main is par vichaar kiya jaataa he use vaakya-vichaar yaa vaakya-vigyaan kehete hai
 It has three forms - vaakya-rachana kaa sambandh bolanewaale samaaj ke manovigyaan se hota he
 Therefore this branch of linguistics is very difficult
 rup-vigyaan : vaakya kii rachana padon yaa roopon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Therefore, the idea of verse or form becomes important after a sentence
 rup-vigyaan ke antargat dhaatu, upsarg, pratyay aadi un sabhi upkarnon par vichaar karnaa padataa he jinase rup banate hai
 Phonology: The base word of form or verse
 shabdon par rachana yaa itihaas in do drushtiyon se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The idea of a person or language is also done under it
 kosh-nirmaan tathaa vyutpatti-shaastra shabd-vigyaan ke hi vichaar-kshetra kii seemaa main aate hai
 The cultural history of the speaker can be known on the basis of the word group of the language
 dhwani-vigyaan : shabd kaa aadhaar he dhwani
 Sounds are studied in many ways under phonology
 iske antargat dhwani-shaastra ek alag se upavibhag he jisamen dhwani utpann karne vaale angon-mukh-vivar, nasika-vivar, swar tantri, dhwani yantra ke saath-saath sunne kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 There are two forms of this study - historical and second comparative
 grim niyam kaa sambandh isi se he
 Economics: The outer part of the sentence ends on the sound
 It is the outer body of the language, next to it the field of his soul begins which we call the meaning
 arth-rahit shabd atmarahit sharir kii bhanti vyarth hota he
 Therefore, meaning is an important part of language
 arth-vigyaan main shabdon ke arthon kaa vikaas tathaa uske kaarnon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 We call any study a scientist when we follow a certain process in it
 bhashaa vigyaan bhi kisi bhashaa ke kaaran-kaaryparak yuktipurna vivechan-vishleshan ke liye kuch nishchit prakriyaaon main bandha kar chalata he
 On the basis of these processes, so far we have received five types of studies of linguistics- saamanyatya bhashaa kaa adhyayan nimnaankit drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he : By descriptive method, the form of one language of the same period is analyzed
 iske liye isamen un siddhanton par prakaash daalaa jaataa, jinke aadhaar par bhashaa-vishesh kii rachanaagat visheshtaon ko spasht kiya ja sake
 It is important to note that in this method language cannot be included in different periods simultaneously, because the analysis of language of every age will have the purpose of separate principles
 panini na keval bharat ke, apitu sansar ke sabase bade bhashavigyaani hai, jinhone varnanaatmak rup main bhashaa kaa vishad evam vyapak adhyayan kiya
 Katyayan and Patanjali also fall in this category
 greek vidwaanon main thraiks, discolas tathaa erodian ne bhi is kshetra main ullekhya kaary kiya tha
 Fully influenced by Panini, Bloomfield paved the way for the development of descriptive linguistics by publishing his book 'language' in 1932 AD
 idhar pashchimi deshon - visheshkar america main varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa aashaatheet vikaas hua he
 The purpose of historical linguistics is to consider changes in different periods in a language and to formulate theories in relation to those changes
 varnanaatmak paddati kaa mul antar yah he ki varnanaatmak paddati jahaan ekakalik he, vahaan aitihaasik paddati dvikalik
 The antiquity of the Sanskrit language attracted the attention of linguists towards the historical method
 'filology' kaa mukhya pratipaadya pracheen granthon kii bhashaaon kaa tulanatamak adhyayan hi tha
 The focus of the scholars was mainly on languages like Sanskrit, German, Greek, Latin
 fredrick ougust woolf ne san 1777 i
 main hi aitihaasik paddati kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya tha
 In fact, to understand the developmental form of any language one has to resort to historical method
 puraani hindi athwa madhyakaalin hindi or aadhunik hindi main kya parivartan hua he, ise aitihaasik paddati dwaara hi spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Two or more languages are compared by comparative method
 ise mishrit paddati bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki vivarnaatmak paddati tathaa aitihaasik paddati donon kaa aadhaar liya jaataa he
 One has to define a period for description and at least two languages are required for comparison
 is prakaar, tulanaatmak paddati ko varnanaatmak paddati or aitihaasik paddati kaa yoga kaha ja saktaa he
 The comparative method can apply to any two languages
 jaise, bhartiya bhashaaon - bhojpuri aadi main bhi paraspar tulana kii jaati he yaa phir hindi-angareji, hindi-roosi, hindi-farsi kaa bhi tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 That is, there is no territorial limit
 wiliam jones, france bopp, maxmooler, curtius, ougust shlikhar prabhruti vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 However, so far there is a great lack of principles in comparative linguistics, on the basis of which the classification of two different languages could not become scientific
 sanrachanaatmak paddati varnanaatmak paddati kii agali kadi he
 This method is getting special publicity in America
 isamen yantric upkarnon ko adhik mahatva diya ja rahaa he, jisase anuwaad karne main vishesh suvidha hogi
 Jaelig Harris developed this method by writing a book titled 'methods in Structural Linguistics'
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon ke samaan bhashavigyaan ke bhi prayogtmak paksh hai, jinke liye prayog kii pranaaliyon or prayogshaala kii apeksha hoti he
 Phonetic phonology, physical phonology and auditory phonology are studied by various mechanical experiments
 ise praayogic swanvigyaan, yantric swanvigyaan yaa prayogshaala swanvigyaan bhi kehete hai
