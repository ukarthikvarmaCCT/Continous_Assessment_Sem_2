 Mookerji's selection of economics and sociology at postgraduate level was not only involuntary, but in his own words, "my face-to-face with the sorrow, the filth and the degeneration in the settlements of Calcutta, gave me my future interest in economics and sociology Attracted towards ’’ desh evam raashtra ke liye adhyayan ke vichaar se prabhavit hokar unhone snatakottar str par arthshaastra vishay kaa chayan kiya

 The Chinese Communist Party was established in 1921

 China had a state of civil war from 1946 to 1949

 China has officially called this period the 'liberation struggle'

 Even though it was not formally colonized by any foreign power, but its condition was not better than any other slave country

 britain ne apane swaarthon kii raksha ke liye china main opium ke seven ko badhaava diya tha or is nashe main galiff chiniyon kaa bharpoor utpeedan kiya tha
 Therefore, it was but natural that resentment was growing in the minds of the patriotic Chinese against these oppressive circumstances
 china kii pehali kranti kaa swaroop mukhyatah saanskrithik tha or iskaa sutarapaat dow sanyaat sen ne kiya tha
 It was with his efforts that the Nationalist Chinese Party was established, which is known as 'kuomitang'
 1911 main jis maanchu rajvansh kaa ant kar ganatantr kii sthapana kii gai uskaa asthaayee raashtrapati yuvan shih kaai tha
 But in reactionary and repressive measures, he banned the Kuomitang Dal and Sanayat Sen had to flee to Japan

 In 1917, the Kuomitang Party attempted to establish a democratic government in an atmosphere of chaos

 His successor, Chiang Kai-shek, was forced into a civil war with the Communist Party of China

 These individuals also included Maotse Tung who later became the leader of the Chinese Communist Party

 Soon the Communist Party's branches were established in the provinces of Canton, Shanghai and Hunan, and the first conference of all these branches was held in Shanghai in 1921 with the goal of liberating China from foreign hegemony
 is samyavaadee vichaardhaara ne china ke udaar rashtravaadiyon ko bhi prabhavit kiya jinamein sanyaat sen bhi shaamil the
 In fact, Dr
 Sanayat Sen wanted to get foreign aid to organize China, but the imperialist states of the west did not help him, eventually he turned to the Soviet Union
 rus ne samyavaadee prasar ke lobh main china ke prati sahanubhuti jataai or use har tarah kii sahaayta dene kaa aashwaasan diya
 In this context, in 1921 AD, Comington's representative Mering met Sanayat Sen and discussed mutual cooperation

 Russian communist thinkers asked the Chinese Communist Party to work together with the Kuomitang Party

 This cooperation remained until Sanayat Sen was alive and the two teams continued to work together
 kintu 12 march, 1925 ko sanyaat sen kii mrityu ho gai
 Thereafter, differences arose between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomitang

 He organized farmers and laborers in his favor and established a trade union at the national level

 Similarly, farmers unions were formed which demanded reduction of revenue and abolition of zamindari

 This movement not only overthrew the landlords but changed the structure of the society by occupying property
 sanyaat sen kii mrityu ke baad kuomitanga dal kaa pradhan chyang kaai shaike bana
 He had goodwill with businessmen and landlords
 usne samyavaadiyon ko kuomitanga dal se nishkasit kar diya
 Chiang believed that the communists were becoming powerful, invading the landlords and occupying their property
 atah inhen samaapt karnaa aavashyak he
 Chiang Kai-shek launched a purification movement by expelling the Communists from the party in which thousands of communists, trade unionists and peasant leaders were killed
 is tarah chyang kaai shaike ne nanking main apni satta ko majbootee se sthapit kiya
 In 1943, Maotse Tung became the chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and became the top leader
 maao ke netritv main samyavaadee dal ne apni shakti kaa vistaar kiya or “kiyangsi” praant main apni satta kaa kendra banaaya
 Gradually, he established his own power governments in the provinces of Frukien, Hunan etc
 mio ne communist party kii ranneeti main vyapak parivartan karte hue is baat par jor diya ki communist party ko audyogic mazdooron kii tulana main kisaanon ke bich jansamarthan praapt karne kii koshish kerani chahie
 The reason was that China was originally an agricultural country where the industrial revolution was still backward
 kiyangsi praant kii communist maaon sarkaar nanking kii kuomitanga sarkaar kii satta ko sweekaar nahin karti thi
 The government of Nanking under Chiang Kai Chek campaigned fiercely in 1934 against the communist government of Qiangsi to strengthen its position
 ise “unmoolan abhiyaan” ke naas se janaa jaataa he
 Communists were killed in lakhs
 is daman or atyaachaar se bachane ke liye samyavaadiyon ne uttar main shensi praant kii ore “mahaprasthaan” kiya jo 16 oktober, 1934 se prarambh hokar 20 oktober, 1935 main puraa hua
 Crossing many rivers, mountains, forests, this 6000 mile long distance, reached Yenan city of Shenxi province and established his government there as his capital
 yahan dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki 1921 i
 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya tha
 Chiang Kai-shek understood communism as a greater threat than the Japanese at this time and exerted his entire power in the suppression of communists
 samyavaadiyon ne mahaprasthaan kar jis shensi praant main apni sarkaar sthapit kii vah japan dwaara adhikrut uttari china ke nikat tha or samyavaadiyon ne japani akraman or prabhutv ke virodh kii baat kii
 Mao said that both the Kuomitang and the Communists should jointly establish a government in the country and together with the Japanese invasion, they should establish a government in the country and together with the Japanese invasion, they should be expelled from the country 
 samyavaadiyon ke is drushtikon se chini janata kaa bahumat unke saath ho gaya faltah samyavaadee ko apni shakti badhaane kaa mauka mila
 Chiang Kai-shek considered it more important to wipe out the Communists than to stop the Japanese, and so sent an army to Liaoning Shenxi province to fight with the Communists in 1936, but the Communists did not think it appropriate to fight their Chinese brothers and under Liang Sent the sent army with national consciousness and asked the Japanese to fight
 jab chyang kaai shaike ne samyavaadiyon ke daman kii hi baat kii tab liyang ne use bandi bana liya kintu samyavaadiyon ke hastkshep se antat vah mukt hua
 Therefore, in view of the desire of Chinese Lokmat, Chiang began negotiations with the Samvadis and entered into an agreement in 1937 to destroy Japan's dominance by making concerted efforts
 is samjhaute ke anusaar uttar-pashchimi china ke shensi or kangsu praant par samyavaadiyon ke shashan ko sweekaar kiya gaya or samyavaadee sena ko china kii rashtriya sena kaa ang maan liya gaya jise japan ke viruddh mahasenapati chyang kaai shaike ke adeshon kaa paalan karnaa tha
 Thus, two separate governments existed in China at this time
 donon kii apni-apni pruthak senaayen thi or donon apane-apane kshetron main apane aadarshon ke anusaar shashan or saamaajik vyavastha ke vikaas main tatpar thi
 This agreement proved to be extremely important in increasing the power of the Communists
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kiya or use parajeet kiya tathaa china par kabja kar liya
 Chiang Kai-shek had to retreat and Chungqing was made its capital in the west after Japan took control of Nanking
 duusari taraf shensi praant main date hue communiston ne uttar main japan ke viruddh kargar chhapamar ladaai kaa netritv kiya or apane ko logon ke saamne deshbhakt rashtrivadi ke rup prastut kiya
 Because of this, there was a huge support from the Japanese oppressed peasants and the middle class
 is bich dwitiya vishwayuddh aarambh ho gaya or china-japan yuddh dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa ang ban gaya
 Even at that time Chiang Kai-shek was concerned with increasing power to the communists, not the Japanese invasion
 vah japan ke viruddh sangharsh kii apeksha china kii aantarik raajnneeti ko adhik mahatv detaa tha
 Therefore, the situation of conflict between the Communists and the Kuomitang resurfaced
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke shuru ho jane se china-japan yuddh america-british nitiyon se prabhavit hone laga
 The United States and Britain transported millions of tons of war material by air to help Chiang Kai-shek's government so that the influence of Japan or Russia would not increase in China
 vastutah china ke aantarik maamalon main america or britain ke hastkshep kaa ek bada kaaran unka samyavaadee vichaardhaara kaa virdohi hona tha
 Britain and America wanted to stop the civil war in China because the victory of powerful communists who were powerful in the event of civil war was almost certainly seen
 america or britain ne chungking kii chyang koi shaike sarkaar ko apane paksh main karne ke liye 1943 main uske saath ek sandhi kii
 Under the treaty, these two countries renounced their privileges in China and acknowledged that China is equivalent to the western countries in political terms and is a major powerful state in the world
 america sahit mitrarashtra yah chaahate the ki china kii chyang kaai shaike sarkaar japan ke saath yuddh ko jari rakhe or uske saath koi samjhauta nahi karen
 At the same time, he will work with the communist government to fight the Japanese
 is uddeshy se parichaalit hokar america ne general steelwel tathaa america rajdoot harle ke madhyam se yah prayaas kiya ki chyang kaai shaike tathaa samyavaadiyon ke bich samjhauta ho jaae or ve milakar japaniyon kaa saamana kare,kintu america kaa yah prayaas asafal rahaa or donon ke bich samjhauta na ho sakaa
 In 1945, Japan surrendered and World War II came to an end, but the problem of China did not end
 vastutah nanking main japan kaa niyantran tha or yuddh kii samaapti pashchaat yah samasya utpann hui ki nanking sarkaar ke adhikrut pradeshon par chungking kii kuomitanga sarkaar kaa aadhipaty ho yaa yenon praant kii samyavaadee sarkaar ke adhikrut pradeshon par chungking kii kuomitanga sarkaar kaa aadhipaty ho yaa yenon praant kii samyavaadee sarkaar kaa, donon dal nanking par niyantran hetu aage bade
 Therefore, a situation of civil war arose again in China
 america ne grihayuddh ko taalane ke liye 1945 main general marshall ko donon dalon ke bich samjhauta karaane evam loktantr kii sthapana karaane hetu bheja
 This agreement was concluded on 10 January 1946 with the efforts of Marshall
 samjhaute ke anusaar jis pradesh main jis dal kii sena kaa adhikaar he vah usee sena ke adhikaar main rahegaa, kintu yah samjhauta sthaayee nahin rahaa or tamaam pradeshon par adhikaar ko lekar grihayuddh aarambh ho gaya
 The communist army established its authority over many territories of northern and eastern China
 janvari 1949 tak samyavaadiyon ne tintsin or peking par adhikaar kar liya or aage chalakar nanking, shanghai hanko tathaa canton par bhi adhikaar kar liya or 1 oktober, 1949 ko samyavaadiyon ne peking main “locaganraajya” kii ghoshnaa kii or soviet sangh sahit anek deshon ne is samyavaadee sarkaar ko manyata de di
 Thus the communist revolution in China was successful
 chyang kaai shaike kii kuomitanga sarkaar formosa dweep main simat kar rah gai
 By not recognizing the communist government of China, the US recognized the nationalist government based in Formosa as the government of China and maintained its relationship
 vastutah samyavaadiyon or chyang kaai shaike ke bich sangharsh main america chaahate hue bhi chyang ko khulaa samarthan nahin de sakaa kyonki tab rus samyavaadiyon ke samarthan main aa jaataa
 In this case, there would have been a possibility of direct conflict between the us-russia
 faltah america ne praayah tatasthta kii niti kaa samarthan kiya or is kaaran chyang kaai shaike kii raajnneetik sthiti atyant kamjor ho gai
 1
 Unpopularity and corrupt governance of the Kuomitang Dal: The Kuomitang government under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek was corrupt and worthless
 unke janata ko sudhaar ke rup main dene ke liye kuch nahin tha
 He did not announce any program that could achieve widespread public support
 itnaa hi nahin kuomitanga sarkaar ne apana adhikansh samay udyogpatiyon, bankeron va jameendaaron ke hiton kii raksha main ganvaaya
 Corruption was prevalent in the government, the material brought for the use of the public was being used in private commercial means, in such a situation the government lost public support

 The military weakness and ineptitude of Chiang's government became evident during the Civil War
 In fact, Chiang's army conducted the war by making large cities central, but these cities were surrounded by communists
 iske vipareet samyavaadee sena daksh or kushal thi
 He fought the war by adopting a strategy of guerrilla method, maintaining discipline in the army
 faltah rashtravaadiyon ke viruddh ve safal hue

 Socio-economic dissatisfaction among various sections of the society: Nothing was done by the Kuomitang government to alleviate the poverty of the farmers
 sookhe or akaal se pedi∏t krishakon kii dasha behaal thi duusari ore shaharon main munafkhoron, saudagaron kii madiyon ne anaaj kii kami nahin thi
 US dominance was excessive in China and foreign capitalists were exploiting China heavily
 kuomitanga sarkaar is shoshan ko roak paane main asamarth thi
 As a result, the capitalist class including the general public also became opposed to the government
 vastutah jansamarthan hasil karne ke liye kuomitanga sarkaar ne koi thos saamaajik, aarthik kaarykram pesh nahin kiya jabaki samyavaadiyon ne aisa kaarykram pesh kar jansamarthan hasil kiya

 Nationalist government's relationship with imperialist powers: China's nationalist Kuomitang government had relations with imperialist countries such as America
 chini arthvyavastha america aarthik samrajyavaadee niti se parichaalit ho rahi thi
 The American bank had control over China's banking system

 By 1848, this volume had become so high that most of China's industrial units were closed and all the workers became useless
 yahi vajah he ki kisaan-majdoor aadi logon ne sarkaar kii niti se asantusht hokar grihayuddh main chini samyavaadiyon kaa saath diya

 This area is rarely mentioned in ancient Indian literature, in such a situation it is impossible to unquestionably present the history of this district after taking proper review of available literary and archaeological sources
 phir bhi iske gauravshaalee ateet ke punarniman kaa prayaas is lekh kaa abhishth he
 In the epic period, this region was known as Karpath, which was a part of the Kosala kingdom
 aisa prathit hota he ki is kshetra par rajya karne vaale pracheenatam samraat ikshvaku the, jinaki rajdhani ayodhya thi
 After Ikshvaku divided this dynasty into several small kingdoms and made his son Kusha the king of Kushavati, whose modern parity is established with Kushinagar

 jiske bansgaanv sthit gopalpur ke saath sweekrut kiya jaataa he
 It seems that the southern part of the present Maharajganj district must have been influenced by this victory trip of Bhimsen

 a number of small republican states came into existence under the Kosala kingdom, in which the kingdom of Kapilavastu's Sakyas and the Kolgis of Ramgram was extended even within the boundaries of the present Maharajganj district

 It may be known that in the Mathura Stone article of Shodas, an officer named Ganjwar is clearly mentioned

 main purv main anya ganatantron kii bhaanti coliya ganatantr bhi ek sunishchit bhogaulik ikai ke rup main sthit tha
 The rule here was governed by the decision of certain elite citizens

 Evidence of this is noted in the active and effective role of Mahatma Buddha in resolving the dispute between Shakyo and Kolis described in Buddhist texts about the waterways of Rohini river
 is ghatana se yah bhi pramanit ho jaataa he ki is kshetra ke nivasee ati pracheen kaal se hi krishi karm ke prati jaagruk the

 About 16 million lightning is produced every year in the world
 sambhavat: anya kisi bhi prakritik ghatana ne itnaa bhay, romaanch or aashcharya nahin utpann kiya hoga or na aaj bhi karti hogi jitna taditapaat or badalon kii kadak se utpann hota he
 From time immemorial, the belief was prevalent in almost all the countries of the world that lightning is the punishment of God, which he inflicts on the creature or object on which he becomes angry
 greek or roman deshvasi ise bhagwaan jupiter kaa prahaardand maan te the
 Even today, many people think the same and rely more on the superstition that has been cultivated instead of trying to understand the scientific cause of lightning
 pracheen dharmagrathon main varnit anek kathaayen unke is andhvishwaas ko bal detii hai
 When there was some increase in the electrical information, the scientists came to the idea that the phenomenon of lightning is similar to the way the condenser flows through the air between the plates when it is exposed
 is dharna kii pushti karne ke liye prayog karne kaa saahas kisi ko nahin hota tha; kintu ant main benjamin franklin kii prerana se france ke do vaigyanikon, dalibard or delor, ne prayog karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He took two metal rods
 dalibard kaa chad 40 foot tathaa delor kaa chad 99 foot unchaa tha
 With both rods, they were able to immerse sphulings of about one and a half inches in length
 yah prayog anyant khatarnaak tha or aage chalakar ek anya vaigyanik ne yahi prayog doharaate samay apane praanon se hi haath dhoyaa tha
 Nevertheless, it could not be determined from the above experiment that the electricity generated in the sticks came from the clouds, because the rods had no access to the clouds
 isaliye benjamin franklin ne apana patangvaala suvikhyath prayog kiya
 He flew a kite and carried it inside the clouds
 jyonhi patang kii door bhigi, patang or door donon hi tan gaye jisase yah pataa chalaa ki donon vidyut aavesh yukt ho gaye he
 Franklin also tied a key in that door
 chaabi ke paas ungali le jane se donon ke chatchathat kii aawaaj ke saath sphulingon kaa visarjan hua
 Not only this, he also charged him by touching the key with a leaden jar
 isse yah nishchit ho gaya ki badalon main bhi vidyut hoti he
 The immersion in the electric form of this power is called "lightning"
 yah visarjan badal or badal, athwa badal or prithvi, ke bich ho saktaa he
 Lightning usually occurs in the Kapasivarshi clouds
 in meghon main atyant prabal urdhvagami pavandharaayen chalati hai, jo lagbhag 40,000 foot kii oonchaai tak pahunchati hai
 There are some such activities in them, due to which the electric charges are generated and dissociated
 in kriyaaon ke spashtikaran ke liye wilson, simpasan, sakrij aadi ne apane siddhant prastut kiye hai, jo paraspar virdohi jaan padate hai, kintu itnaa to sabhi batalaate hai ki tadit kii jananaprakriya meghon main hoti he or iske liye un meghon main vidyaman jalsikar, athwa himakan aadi avakshepan kan, hi uttaradaayi hote hai
 Even with respect to the electrification of clouds, all are unanimous that their upper levels are rich and the middle and lower levels are negative
 in aaveshon kaa vibhaajan meghon ke andar shunya degree sein0 tapawale staron ke bhi kaaphi upar hota he
 From this, it is easy to conclude that the charge is formed by the snowflakes formed in the clouds and the upward wind currents, not by the water droplets
 kabhi-kabhi nimna str main bhi kahin-kahin dhanaveshon kaa ek centre sa ban jaataa he
 Due to the formation of negative charge at low levels of clouds, the positive charges are generated by induction at the bottom of the earth
 badalon ke aage badhane ke saath hi prithvi par ke ye dhanavesh bhi thik usee prakaar aage badhate jate hai
 Attracted by negative charges, the surface positive charges climb up to the conductor or semiconductor objects standing on the earth
 is vidhi se jab meghon kaa vidyutikaran is seemaa tak pahunch jaataa he ki padosi aaveshkendron ke bich vibhav pravanta vibhang maan tak pahunch jaati he, tab vidyut kaa visarjan deergh sphuling ke rup main hota he
 This is called lightning
 prithvi kii ore aanevaali tadit kai kramon main hokar pahunchati he
 a hilol of electrons from the cloud comes down 50 meters in 1 micro second and stops
 lagbhag 50 maa0 se0 ke pashchaat doosraa kram aarambh hota he or isi prakaar kai kramon main hokar ant main yah tarang prithvi tak pahunchati he
 This is called major trauma
 apane udgamasthal se prithvi tak pahunchne main ise kul 0
002 second tak kaa samay lagata he
 The above facts were revealed by the photo taken by Schönland and his colleagues with the help of a highly sensitive camera
 usee photo pattica par yah bhi dikhalaai padaa ki pramukh kram ke prithvi par pahunchne ke kshan hi ek atyant tikshan jyoti prithvi se meghon kii ore unheen kramon main hokar gai jinase hokar pramukh kram aayaa tha
 This is called regressive emergency
 jahaan pramukh kram kaa ausat veg 105 meter prati second hota he vahiin pratigaami aadhaat kaa veg 107 meter prati second hota he, kyonki uskaa maarg pehle se hi ynit hone ke kaaran prashast rahata he
 Even after the above major and regressive strokes, many strokes are seen moving downwards and upwards respectively
 ye dwitiyak aghat kehalaate hai
 These secondary accidents coming down do not come in the same order as the major shock
 si0 epa0 vagner or ji0 di0 mccan ne batalaaya he ki badalon ke vibhav praaia: do karod volt kii koti ke hote he
 Simpson and Screege concluded by experiments that the potential of clouds at a height of 10,000 feet often declined at a rate of 50 to 100 volts per cm
 tadit prakriya ke bich main vidyuddhara kaa maan do lakh se pandrah hajaar ampiore ke bich rahata he
 Due to this strong current, the molecules and atoms of air entering the path of lightning ionize and produce light
 yahi chamak hamen damini ke rup main dikhalaai padati he
 It is clear that through air the electrification between the clouds and the earth will be more probable where the power will have to cross the resistance of the air to a minimum
 isaliye unchi minaaron, unche bhawanon, ekaaki vriksh tathaa pataakadand ityadi par taditapaat adhiktar hota he iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki koi vastu badal se jitani hi adhki nikat hogi, usapar utana hi adhik prarit aavesh utpann hoga
 Apart from this, due to the point of the minarets, tree peaks, etc
 being more flat than the flat ground, the electric charge accumulates on them more
 taditaghatjanit vidyuddhara ekadish hoti he
 In the period of five microseconds of shock, its value increases from exponential order to maximum and decreases to only half within about 25 microseconds
 yah prabal dhara praaia: 100 microsecond tak rahati he
 After this, some of the decreasing thousand respectively reach the ampere and it remains the same for some millennium seconds
 yadi taditaghaat kii punrariti nahin hui to kam hote hote yah dhara nishesh ho jaati he
 There are generally three types of lightning: vistrut tadit kaaphi vistrut kshetra par hoti he or iskaa aviral prakaash badalon par kaaphi dur tak fail jaataa he
 Striped or lined lightning is often visible
 isamen ek yaa adhik prakasharekhaayen, sidhi yaa tedi idhar-udhar daudti hui drushtigochar hoti hai
 In this, the electric discharge would be from cloud to cloud, cloud to earth or cloud to atmosphere
 yah tadit swayan teen prakaar kii ho sakati: Like a lighted ball lightning the condom, the earth is seen coming
 iskaa ausat vyas 20 senmi0 hota he
 As it moves towards the Earth, its velocity decreases
 lagbhag teen se paanch second tak dikhalaai padane ke uparaant vah atyant prachand dhwani ke saath visphotit ho jaati he
 It appears very rare and the cause of its origin is unknown
 bhawanon ko tadit ke sidhe aghat se bachaane ke liye benjamin franklin dwaara viksit tadit dand vyavastha sarvaadhik shreshth he
 An iron rod, with its upper end pointed like a spear and protruding to the very top of the building, is buried deep inside the ground through the side of the building
 nichalaa sira bhoomi main taanbe kii ek pattica main laga hota he
 This lightning not only paves the way for the minimum resistance to lightning existing in the cloud, but it instantly transmits the induced currents produced on the building to the earth immediately
 is prakaar yah badalon or bhawan ke bich aaveshon ke parsparik aakarshan kii sambhaavna bhi paryaapt gata detaa he
 Since the past, during the days of electric cymbals, sailors have been seeing the erosion of the lightning of the clouds from the mast of their ships
 yah ksharan raat ko adhik spasht dikhalaai padataa he
 It is called the fire of the European sailor Saint Elmo
 aajkal taditaniyantran sambandhi anek prayog kiye ja rahe hai
 a recreational experiment was done by sitting a person in a motorcar and sending artificial light from top to bottom on that motor
 chunki tadit main vidyaman electranon main, samaan aaveshyukt hone ke kaaran, paraspar vikarshan hota he, isaliye motorcar kii chat par girte hi ve bikhar gaye or uski deevaaron se hote hue neeche prithvi main chale gaye
 This could not penetrate the motor and the person remained completely safe
 is prayog se yah nishchay ho jaataa he ki aadhunik dhaatu ke dhaanchevaale bhawanon main, jinaki neenv kaaphi gahari hoti he, baitha hua vyakti tadit ke prahaar se atyant niraapad hota he
 If such buildings, or light-headed buildings, cannot be found, then shelter should be taken in such a large building which is quite wide
 tadityukt aandhi tufaan ke samay angithiyon, stove tathaa vidyut ke anya suchalkon se swayan ko yathashakti dur hi rakhana chahie
 Those outside should never live on top of the hills, on piles of straw, etc
, under isolated trees, near gnomes, or near any metal object, nor should anything be made of metal
 pahaado kii kandaraon main, ghaney wanon athwa kisi dhaalu pahari ke neeche rahanaa sarvatha niraapad hota he
 It is such a system in which it has the special property of instantly reducing the charged potential
 saath hi yah apane andar se pravaahit hone vaali taditdhaara kii prabalata main vruddhi ko roktaa he
 It usually consists of an internal arrangement, which is connected in series to a resistor
 iskaa pratirodh isamen pravaahit vidyutddhara ke maan main vruddhi hone ke saath ghatata he
 The function of differential device is that it keeps the non-linear resistor completely isolated from the reciprocating current
 in donon main sampark tabhi ho paata he jab itnaa unchaa vibhav utpann ho jaataa he jo khaali sthaan kii vaayu ko bhi suchalak bana detaa he
 Thus the lightning current flows safely through the earth without damaging the power circuit of the alternating current

 iske baad purna rihaai ke evaj main 30 lakh or praapt kiye, saath hi jaagiron main aaajeevan company dwaara koi hastkshep na hone kaa vaada bhi kiya gaya
 These jagirs were later confiscated for supporting Begum in Chai Singh's rebellion, later documentary evidence of this cooperation was also found
 abhi mili pramaanon se yah prathit hota he ki warren hestings ne nawab ko apni aakshamataaon se bachaane kii puri koshish kii thi or ve beghamon ke prati bhi kaafii naram the
 At that time Awadh was considered as the granary of India, which was strategically important to control the area of fertile land between the river Ganges and Yamuna called Doab
 yah bahut hi dhanwaan rajya tha or yah maraathon, angrezon or afagaanon se apni swatantraaa banaae rakh paaya tha
 In 1732, the Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, declared Awadh to be independent

 "all of this raises questions over Wikipedia's credibility as a source of accurate information
 2008 main, do shodhakartaaon ne siddhant diya ki vikipedia kaa vikaas satat he
 Wikipedia has been accused of exhibiting systematic bias and inconsistency; Critics argue that the lack of appropriate sources for most information and Wikipedia's open nature make it unreliable
 kuch tippaneekaron kaa suzav he ki vikipedia aamtaur par vishwasaneey he, lekin kisi bhi die gaye lekh kii vishwasaneeyata hameshaa spasht nahin hoti he
 Editors of traditional reference works such as Encyclopaedia Britannica, question the utility and reputation of the project as an encyclopedia
 vishvavidhyalayon ke kai pravaktaa academik kaary main kisi bhi encychlopedia, kaa praathmik strot ke rup main upyog karne se chaatro ko hatotsahit karte hai; kuch to vishesh rup se vikipedia ke upyog ko nishiddh karte hai
 Co-founder Jimmy Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any kind are generally not suitable as primary sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative
 upyogkartaaon kii gopneeyata ke parinamswaroop lekhe-jokhe kii kshamta kii kami ke sambandh main bhi mudde uthaaye gaye hai, saath hi kritrim soochna kii pravishti, vidhwans pravriti or isi tarah kii anya samasyaayein bhi saamne aayi hai
 One incident in particular, which gained much publicity, contained misinformation about the biography of American politician John Seigenthaler and could not be traced for four months

" vah tippanee dete hai ki non-fiction ke kai paaramparik strot pranaligat purvagrahon se peedit he
 In journal articles new results are reported more than necessary and relevant information is removed from the news report
 haalaanki, ve yah chetavanee bhi dete hai ki internet kii citon par trutiyaan aksar paayi jaati hai or shikshavidon tathaa visheshgyon ko inhen sudhaarney ke liye satark rahanaa chahie, In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper stated that some professors at Harvard University incorporate Wikipedia into their curriculum, but they differ in their concept of using Wikipedia
 june 2007 main america librari association ke bhootpurv adhyaksh maaikel gormann google ke saath, vikipedia ko nindan kiya, or kaha ki ve shikshavid jo vikipedia ke upyog kaa samarthan karte hai "bauddhik rup se us aahaar visheshgy ke samatuly hai jo sab chizon ke saath big maiks ke nirantar aahaar kii salaah dete hai
 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki "bauddhik rup se niskriy logon kii ek peedi jo internet se aage badhane main asamarth he", use vishvavidhyalayon main utpann kiya ja rahaa he
 He complains that web-based sources are preventing him from learning the more scarce text that is found only in documents or on subscription-only websites
 isi lekh main jenni frai ne vikipedia kii academik shiksha par tippanee di ki: "aap yah nahin kah sakate hai ki bachche bauddhik rup se aalsee hai kyonki ve internet kaa upyog kar rahen hai jabaki duusari ore shikshavid apane anusandhan main search ingine kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 The difference is that whatever they are receiving is official or not and they have more experience of being complicit about it
 bacchon ko yah bataane kii aavashyaktaa he ki ek mahatvapurn or uchit tareeke se internet kaa upyog kaise kiya jaye
 " vikipedia samudaay ne vikipedia kii vishwasaneeyata ko sudhaarney kii koshish kii he
 The English-language Wikipedia introduced an evaluation scale that examines the quality of articles; Other versions have also adopted it
 angraji main lagbhag 2500 lekh "fichard artical" ke darje ke ucchtam rank tak pahunchne ke liye maapdandon ke samucchy ko paas kar chuke hai; aise lekh apane vishay main sampoorn or bhalee prakaar se likhaa gaya kawarez uplabdh karaate hai, jinhen kai sahakarmi samiksha prakashnon ke dwaara samarthan praapt he
 German Wikipedia is testing a system of maintaining "static versions" of articles, so that it helps a reader see versions of articles that have gone through specific reviews
 anya bhashaaon ke sanskaran is "dhwajaankit sanshodhan" ke prastaav ko lagu karne ke liye ek sahmati tak nahin pahunche hai
 Another proposal is to use the software to create "trust ratings" for individual Wikipedia contributors and to use these ratings to determine which changes will appear immediately
 vikipedia samudaay ne "a bureaucracy of sorts" kii sthapana kii he, jisamen "ek spasht satta saranchana shaamil he jo swayan sevi prashaskon ko sampadakeey niyantran kaa adhikaar detii he
 Wikipedia's community has also been described as "cult-like", although it has not always been described as such, with completely negative connotations, and criticized it for its failure to accommodate inexperienced users

 Apart from the name, administrators do not exercise any privileges in making decisions; Instead they are mostly limited to editing articles that have project wide effects and thus do not allow general editors and restrict users to disruptive editing

 Jimmy Wells once argued that only "a community 


 a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" contributes too much to Wikipedia and so the project "resembles a traditional organization" Wells found in a study More than 50% of edits are done by only 
7% of users, yogadan ke moolyankan kii is vidhi par baad main aaron savaartz ne vivaad uthaaya unhone note kiya ki kai lekh jin par unhone adhyayan kiya, unke avyavon ke ek bade bhaag main upyogkartaaon ne kam sampaadan ke saath yogadan diya tha
 a 2007 study by researchers at Dartmouth College found that "anonymous and rare contributors to Wikipedia xxrep 9

 " haalaanki kuch yogadanakarta apane kshetra main praadhikari hai, vikipedia ke liye yah aavashyak he ki yahan tak ki unke yogadanakarta ko prakashit or nirikshan ke sutron dwaara samarthan praapt ho
 The priority of agreeing on the merits of the project has been marked as "anti-excellent"

 Wikipedia has been working on transfers to the Creative Commons license, because the GFDL initially designed for the software manvel is not suitable for online reference functions, and because both licenses were incompatible

 The way of handling media files varies by language version
 kuch bhashaa sanskaran jaise angreji vikipedia main uchit upyog siddhant ke arntagat gaiyr muft chhavi filein shaamil hai jabaki anya main aisa nahin hota he

 Nilgai is a large and powerful animal
 kad main nar nilgai ghode jitna hota he, par uske sharir kii banaavat ghode ke samaan santulit nahin hoti
 It feels extremely awkward when running from the front to the lower part of the face
 anya mrigon kii tej chaal bhi use praapt nahin he
 Therefore, he is easily preyed on by tigers, leopards and sonkutas, though it is not easy for a tiger to kill a large male
 chhaunon ko lakadabagghe or gidad uthaa le jate hai
 But many times in the open, dry regions of his stay, he does not have to fear any predators because he can live for many days without drinking water, whereas predators have to drink water daily
 isliye parabhakshi aise shushk pradeshon main kam hi jate hai
 In fact "nilgai" is not as meaningful a name for this creature because females are brown
 neelaapan vayask nar ke rang main paaya jaataa he
 It is a brilliant animal of gray color like gray or gray blue
 uske aage ke pair pichley pair se adhik lambey or balishtha hote hai, jisase uski peeth peeche kii taraf dhaluaan hoti he
 Male and female have mane on the neck
 naron kii gardan par safed baalo kaa ek lanbaa or saghan guchha rahata he or uske pairon par ghutanon ke neeche ek safed pattee hoti he
 The length of the male from nose to tail end is about two and a half meters and height to shoulder is about one and half meter
 uskaa vajan 250 kilo tak hota he
 Females are somewhat smaller
 keval naron main chote, nukile sing hote hai jo lagbhag 20 centimetre lambey hote hai
 Nilgai is the largest of antelope species found in India
 mrug un jantuon ko kaha jaataa he jinamein sthaayee sing hote hai, yani hiranon ke shringabhon ke samaan unke sing har saal girakar nae sire se nahin ugte
 Nilgai is a divine creature
 vah ghaas bhi charati he or jhaadiyon ke pattey bhi khaati he
 She also attacks the crops when given a chance
 use ber ke fal khaanaa bahut pasand he
 Mahou flowers are also eaten with great fervor
 adhik oonchai kii daaliyon tak pahunchane ke liye vah apni pichhali taangon par khadi ho jaati he
 He has good smell and sight, but hearing ability is weak
 vah khule or shushk pradeshon main rahati he jahaan kam oonchai kii contili jhaadiyaan chhitari padi hon
 In such regions her predators are visible from a distance and she immediately runs away
 oobad-khabad jameen par bhi vah ghode kii tarah teji se or bina thake kaaphi dur bhaag sakati he
 She does not forget even in the thick forests
 sabhi nar ek hi sthaan par aakar mel tyaag karte hai, lekin maadaaen aisa nahin karatin
 At such places, a pile of feces gets collected
 ye dher khule pradeshon main hote hai, jisase ki mel tyaagate samay yah chaaron ore aasaani se dekh sake or chhipe parabhakshi kaa shikaar na ho jaae
 Nilgai is found in Rajasthan, parts of Madhya Pradesh, southern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh
 vah sookhe or parnpaati wanon kaa nivasee he
 She eats dry, rough grass-straws and with the help of a long neck she also reaches the tall branches of trees
 lekin uske sharir kaa agrabhag prishthbhag se adhik ooncha hone ke kaaran uske liye pahari kshetron ke dhalaan chadhana jaraa mushkil he
 For this reason it is found only in open forest areas and not in hilly areas
 nilgai main nar or maadaaen adhikansh samay alag jhundon main vichrate hai
 Males are also seen wandering alone
 inhen adhik shaktishaalee naron ne jhund se nikaal diya hota he
 The females also have chowns
 nilgai niraapad jeev prathit ho sakati he par nar atyant jhagadaalu hote hai
 They often fight for females
 ladane kaa unka tarika bhi niraala hota he
 By turning their waist upward like a command, they slowly revolve around each other and try to get closer to each other
 paas aane par ve aage kii taangon ke ghutanon par baithkar ek-duusare ko apni lambii or balishtha gardanon se dhakelte hai
 In this way they look like giraffes while fighting their necks
 adhik shaktishaalee nar apane pratidwandvi ke prishth bhaag par apane paine singon kii chot karne kii koshish karata he
 When the weaker male begins to run away, the victorious male runs behind the fleeing opponent, flapping his broom-like tail like a flag in the air and bowing his neck
 yon ladate nar aas-paas kii ghatnaon se bilkul bekhbar rahete hai or unke bahut paas tak jaaya ja saktaa he
 Each male occupies at least two females
 nilgai bahut kam aawaaj karti he, lekin maadaa kabhi-kabhi bhens ke samaan rambhaati he
 Nilgai binds the pair at any time of the year, but the main breeding time is november-january, when the blue-furred skins of males are in the most beautiful state
 maithun ke baad nar maadaaon se alag ho jate hai or apana alag jhund bana lete hai
 These flocks also contain minor males, whose skin is not yet blue and shiny
 maadaaon ke jhundon main 10-12 sadsy hote hai, par nar adhik bade jhundon main vichrate hai, jinamein 20 tak nar ho sakate hai
 They consist of males of all ages, from small chowns to adult males
 ye nar atyant jhagadaalu hote hai or aapas main baar-baar jor aajamaaish karte rahete hai
 When no one is found to fight, they kill their horns in bushes or on the ground
 nilgai charate yaa sustaate samay atyant satark rahati he
 To choke she chooses the open ground and lies back on each other
 yon letate samay har disha par jhund kaa koi ek sadsy nigaraanee rakhata he
 On seeing any danger, he immediately stands up and calls in a suppressed voice
 chhaune sitambar-oktober main paidaa hote hai jab ghaas kii oonchai unhen chhipaane ke liye paryaapt hoti he
 These chowns are able to stand up to eight hours after being born
 kai baar judawe bachche paidaa hote hai
 All the females of the herd are raised together
 bhukh lagane par chhaune kisi bhi maadaa ke paas jaakar doodh pite hai
 Nilgai can also tolerate extreme heat and resorts to shade for a while to avoid the harsh sunlight
 use pani adhik pine kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati kyonki apni khuraaq se hi vah aavashyak nami praapt kar leti he
 Nilgai is one of the many lucky creatures in India who are protected by the religious beliefs of the people
 chunki is jaanavar ke naam ke saath "gaay" shabd judaa he, use log gaay kii bahan samajhakar maarthe nahin he, haalanki nilgai khadi fasal ko kaaphi nuksaan karti he
 He can be domesticated and a male cart drawn from a bull like a bull

 The joint venture was aimed at the world's best supersonic missiles
 Develop and sell drdo's Dr
 A
 Shivthanu Pillai and npo's Dr
 Herbert Yefremov played an instrumental role in the development of this missile
 The first test of the brahmos missile was carried out on 12 June 2001 from the integrated test site at Chandipur in the Orissa coastal region
 So far several versions of its ramjet technology have been developed
 Based brahmos supersonic missile with 200-300 kg payload can penetrate its targets at a distance of 300 km
 From the ground, the air, the submarines, It can also be launched from anywhere, from the Battle Poto
 The brahmos Cenuvrable version has also been tested so that its route can be changed before it reaches its target after being launched
 There is also a plan to build a sonic missile missile, which will be able to hit its targets at the speed of 7 MAC
 This will have to be done on its own with the aid of Russia, as Russia has signed an international missile technology control treaty, due to which it cannot help other countries in developing a missile with a range of more than 300 km

 david imail durkhim france ke mahaan samajashastri the
 Along with Karl Marx and Max Weber, he is also said to be the chief architect of modern social science and the father of sociology
 david emil durkhime ko aadhunik samajashaastra kaa sansthaapak or samaaj-vaigyanik shabdaawalee main duniya kaa pehla adhikarik samajashastri mana jaataa he
 He was also the first professor of sociology in the university system of study
 apane academik jivan ke teen dashakon main unhone samajashaastra ko na keval ek vishisht anushaasan ke rup main sthapit kiya, balki is anushaasan kii saidhantik or paddatigat jameen bhi taiyaar kii
 Durkheim's Bill of Sociological Concepts considers humans to be the result of social relations
 is kaaran durkhime kaa samajashaastra apane buniyadi dhaanche main vyaktvaad ke kisi bhi rup ko manyata dene se inkaar karata he
 Durkheim Comt, Marx, Weber etc
 sit close to social thinkers in the context of considering human rights as the product of society
 gauratlab he ki vyakti ko samaaj kaa utpaada maananaa or saamaajik parighatna ko kendriya mahatva dena hi samajashaastra ko anya anushasano kii tulana main ek vishisht swaroop pradaan karata he
 This distinction of sociology was not possible without Durkheim
 haalaanki durkhime ne montescue or ruso jaise vichaarkon se lekar vyavahaarwad, samaajwaad tathaa naitik shiksha jaise masalon par bhi saghan chintan kiya he, parantu samajashaastra ke kshetra main unki chaar rachanaaon— 'da divizan of lebar', 'da rules of sosiolgical mathed', 'suiside' tathaa 'da alementary forms of da relijas life' ko sabase zyaada mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 David Emile Durkheim was born in a French Jewish family of Epinal, Lorraine
 unke pita or dada donon hi rabbi the
 His early education was also in a religious school, but at the very beginning of his life he decided to live a completely secular life
 ek adhyavsaayee chaatr ke rup main unhone vikhyath echol normel superioyre main daakhila liya or 1886 main apni doctoret ke ansh ke rup main unhone 'da divizan of lebar in socity' kii rachana kii
 In this work, Durkheim shows the difference between modern and traditional societies, suggesting that while modern society is based on the specialization of labor, traditional society runs on shared beliefs
 unke mutabik samaaj ke roopon kaa yah antar niyamon kii vyavastha ke antar ko bhi darshata he
 In this way, modern society is governed by self-regulation, whereas the rules of traditional society are based on external beliefs and approval
 durkhime ke anusaar chunki saajhe vishwaas sarvamaanya naitikta ke praadhikaar par tike hote hai isliye in vishwaason par aadhaarit vyavastha shakti or dabaav ke jariye hi kaayam rah saktaa he
 Whereas self-regulatory or modern society cannot be balanced without elements like freedom, equality and justice
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki saamaajik roopon kii vividhta ko niyamon ke vishisht dhaanche se jod kar dekhne kaa yah sutrikaran aparaadh or kanoon ke samajashastreey adhyayanon ke liye buniyadi prerak tatva rahaa he
 Durkheim believed that due to confusion in traditional and modern forms of society and the tendency to impose traditional laws or rules on modern societies, it has been responsible for many social problems
 aadhunik samaajon kii yah vyakhya durkhime ke krititv kii vishisht uplabdhi maani jaati he
 In this composition, Durkheim also analyzes the social association or affiliation of a person and holds the view that a person needs special social companionship
 durkhime dikhaate hai ki saamaajik sansthaaon ke andar swatah hi ek sansakti kaa tatva hota he jo apane sahabhaagiyon se ek nishchit vyavhaar kii maang karata he
 Durkheim therefore stressed that social processes should be studied instead of individuals
 unke anusaar in saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa thos rup sansthaaon or vyavhaar main abhivyakt hota he jinka anuvikshan ke aadhaar par bhi adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Durkheim calls these processes social factors or social facts
 durkhime ko samajashastreey adhyayan main sankhyikee ke sarjanaatmak upyog karne kaa shrey bhi jaataa he
 In this regard, his creation Suicide is set as a standard
 is kriti main durkhime ne yah pratipaadit kiya tha ki aatmahatya kii alag-alag daron kii vyakhya vyakti ke saamaajik sambaddhta ke staron main pragat antar ke aadhaar par kii ja sakati he
 For example, he showed that it is not possible to guess why older men commit suicide based on the individual's personal tendencies
 lekin agar vyakti kii saamaajik sthiti ke karkon jaise uske avivaahit hone yaa samaaj se uske algaav aadi par dhyaan diya jaae to aatmahatya ke kaarnon kii shinaakht kii ja sakati he
 Durkheim uses statistics in his studies to reveal the strength or character of social facts such as forms of mutual association of members of a group
 masalan, agar kisi samooh main aapasi saahchary kii bhaavana kamazor he to uske sadasyon main naitik yaa manovaigyanik samasyaayen paye jane kii sambhaavna zyaada hogi
 Conversely, if there is a deep feeling of companionship in a group, then its members will be more willing to sacrifice for their group
 durkhime kii anya kriti 'da rules of sosiolgilakal mathed' samajashaastra main prayukt kii jane vaali paddatiyon kii aadharbhumi maani jaati he
 Durkheim in this work makes it clear that the central theme of sociology is social system, so it should give priority to institutional and systemic forms of society rather than individual
 is rachana main durkhime samajashaastra ko aise hi saamaajik tathyon kaa adhyayan bataate hai
 According to him, there is a special kind of consistency between these social facts which cannot be called just the accumulated result of their constructive parts
 apni rachana suiside main durkhime isi bindu ko spasht karnaa chaahate the ki aatmahatya jaisi nijee parighatna ko bhi logon ke saahchary-sambandhon tathaa saamaajik banding ke aadhaar par vyakhyayit kiya ja saktaa he
 He argued that things like personal feelings, values or thoughts actually originate from social participation
 durkhime kii do rachanaayen 'da divijan of lebar' tathaa 'da alementary forms of da relijas life' tatkaaleen saamaajik vyavastha kii padtaal main aadhunik upagamon kaa istemaal karne ke liye jaani jaati he
 In the sociological discourse of modernity, both these works remain an essential reference even today due to their fine and intensive study
 durkhime kaa chintan gahare arth main aadhunik tha
 Even psychoanalysts like Fried were not free from the prejudices of their time and compared primitive brains to mental patients in his work Total and Taboo, while Durkheim proposed in his work Elementary Forms of the Religious Life that logic Thus, the social structures and beliefs of primitive tribes cannot be undermined by the rationale of modern man
 durkhime ke samay main vyaapt raajnneetik duragrahon ko dekhte hue yah ek saahasik vichaar tha
 Since Durkheim considers logic to be a social product, he rejects the idea that proves humans to be inferior or superior
 durkhime ke is hastkshep ne samajashaastra ko ek buniyadi samtawaad se las kiya he
 In considering the social utility of religion in the above work, Durkheim argues that human participation is an understanding of the basic forms of human reasoning - space, time, classification, power, work and reason only through participation in religious customs and rituals
 Earns a sense of wholeness
 is rachana main durkhime yah vichaar bhi pesh karte hai ki pavitrataa kaa saamaajik anubhav saamaajik antahsambandhon ko janm detaa he
 According to him, the birth of a social person and the development of reasoning is also canceled by this process
 is rachana main durkhime yah bhi kehete hai ki samast avadharanaon kii utpatti samaaj se hi hoti he
 Therefore, in order to develop an understanding of logic, language and meaning, it should be studied in which social forms and contexts words and concepts have been used
 yahan durkhime dharm ko samaaj kaa prakaarya bataate hue ek or ahm sutrikaran karte hai ki dharm saamaajik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhane kaa madhyam he
 Durkheim does not directly deny the truth of religious beliefs, but for him the truth of religion is determined by his ability to encourage rituals or not
 unke anusaar sangathit dharmon ko keval vishwaason ke aadhaar par nahin samajha ja saktaa kyonki is tarah ke dharm aksar samaaj ke parmparik roopon ko akshunn rakhane ke liye vyaktigat aasthaa kaa daman karte hue bhi paye jate hai
 Durkheim's formula regarding the role of religion in modern and traditional societies is also worth considering that the functions of religion are not the same in these two different varieties of society
 parmparik samaajon main to dharm saamaajik niyantran kaa aujaar hota he jabaki aadhunik samaajon main uskaa yah prakaarya gair-zaruri ho jaataa he kyonki aadhunik samaajon main vah gyaan-mimasaa kaa prakaarya nibhaane lagata he
 That is why his role in the social system is not the same as before
 durkhime kii yah nishpatti samajashastreey chintan ke lihaaz se ek uplabdhi kahi jaaegi ki manushya ke ek jaivik praani se saamaajik praani main roopantarit hone kii parighatna ko vyakti kii jaivik kshamtaaon yaa manovigyaan ke aadhaar par vyakhyayit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He argues that the conversion of biological to social is accomplished through social processes
 isliye durkhime ko lagata he ki man or sharir ko do alag iyatta qaraar dene vaala mat keval samaaj kii prakriya se baahar khadey jaivik astitv or saamaajik praani kaa antar darshata he
 According to him the first stage creature cannot be called a rational human being
 ve is baat par bhi jor dete hai ki manushya main tarkbuddhi yaa vyaktitv jaisi chizein samaaj kii prakriya se hi paidaa hoti hai
 Durkheim believed that to maintain a human being as a social animal, social processes and special forms of association are needed
 yani saamaajik manushya ko uske nishchit saamaajik vinyas or sandarbh se alag hataakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Therefore Durkheim warns that if any method of study of psychology, economics or philosophy undertakes to understand social phenomena only on the basis of the accumulated activities of individuals, then it should be held guilty of bypassing the most important aspect like society
 hgfrtewxurkzaima ke chintan or krititv main samtawaad kii spasht pratishtha ke baavjood nariwadi vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki unhone striyon ke mudde par paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 To a certain extent, it is true that as a sociologist, no work of Durkheim is concentrated on the female side
 lekin unnisvin sadi ke jis daur main durkhime samajashaastra ko vyavasthit kar rahe the us samay striyon ke prashnon par bahut kam saamaajik chintak vichaar kar rahe the
 In Suicide, he mentions a fatalistic type of suicide, which he mainly associates with women
 durkhime kaa khyaal yah bhi tha ki vivaah purushon ke liye to laabhakaari hota he lekin striyon ke jivan par uskaa nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 In The Division of Labor, Durkheim refers to the indigenous people, stating that the social status of women in such communities was not inferior to that of men, whereas female status in modern societies has become weaker
 tatkaaleen samaaj kii ausat pravriti stri ko komal or kamazor ke rup main chitrit karti thi
 In view of this, Durkheim's vision will surely be called as pioneer
 durkhime kaa avdaan samajashastriyon kii kai pidiyon ke liye prerana, prashnankan, samaveshan or jirah kaa vishay rahaa he
 In the thirties, Talcott Parsons attempted to assimilate Durkheim's work into structural functionalism
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki america main durkhime ke avdaan ko prakaaryawad or pratyakshthawaad ke najaariye se dekha jane laga
 While in France, his vision was used by anthropologists such as levi-strauss who were interested in creating a symbolist anthropology based on the concepts, ideas, and interrelationships of society, as propounded by Durkheim
 lekin durkhime ke vichaaron ko aadhaar banaakar nayi vyakhya karne kaa yah upkram is myne main ekangi sabit hua ki usne durkhime kii mul prastaavnaon ke kuch nishchit hisson kaa hi istemaal kiya
 Marxist stream sociologists have attempted to counterbalance Parsons' approach by emphasizing the radical nature inherent in Durkheim's thinking in his writings, which emphasizes the proving of Durkheim as politically conservative
 samajashastriyon ke ek samooh kaa maananaa he ki durkhime kaa samajashaastra vyakti ko gaun kar detaa he
 But if we look carefully, Durkheim does so intentionally
 unki drushti samaaj ko multah samuhikta main samajhane kaa aagrah karti he tathaa is baat par jor detii he ki agar saamaajik siddhanton kii padtaal or samajashaastra ke vyavhaar main antarvirodhon ke adhyayan ko tavajjo na dekar use vyaktvaad kaa paryaay bana diya jaataa he to samajashaastra kaa buniyadi uddeshy nirast ho jaataa he
 Durkheim's task of sociology is not to provide raw material for philosophical research and then wait for what the philosopher's vision says in his assessment
 iske barakes, durkhime yah israar karte hai ki samajashaastra ko saamaajik tathyon ke adhyayan sambandhi kasautiyon kaa nirmaan khud karnaa chahie
 He rejected the argument of philosophers that social facts have an element of contingency
 is aalochana kaa suchintit jawaab dete hue durkhime ne kaha ki samaaj kii nirantarata banaaye rakhane ke liye kuch khaas tarah ke or sthaayee rup zaruri hote hai

 Vasant Panchami or Sripanchami is a Hindu festival
 is din vidya kii devi saraswati kii puja kii jaati he
 This puja is celebrated with great enthusiasm in eastern India, northwest Bangladesh, Nepal and many nations
 is din striyaan pile vastra dhaaran karti hai
 In ancient India and Nepal, spring was the most desirable season of the people among the six seasons in which the whole year was divided
 jab phulon par bahaar aa jaati, kheton main sarson kaa sona chamakane lagata, jau or gehun kii baaliyaan khilne lagatee, aamon ke pedo par bor aa jaataa or har taraf rang-birangi titliyaan mandraane lagatee
 a big celebration was held on the fifth day of the month of Magha to welcome the spring season, which would have worshiped Vishnu and Kamadeva, it was called the festival of Vasant Panchami

 What do the artists have to say? The importance that the soldiers have for their weapons and Vijayadashami, for the scholars, for their books and Vyas Purnima, for the merchants, for their scales, weights, books and Deepavali, the same importance is for the artists Vasant Panchami

 The day of Vasant Panchami also reminds us of Prithviraj Chauhan
 unhone videshi hamalavar mohammad gori ko 16 baar parajeet kiya or udaartaa dikhaate hue har baar jivit chhod diya, par jab satrahavin baar ve parajeet hue, to mohammad gori ne unhen nahin choda
 He took them with him to Afghanistan and burst his eyes

 The arrow that he had guessed from the injury on the pan and the sign of Chandbardai, hit Mohammad Ghori in the chest
 iske baad chandbardaai or prithviraj ne bhi ek duusare ke pet main chura bhaunkkar atmbalidaan de diya
 This incident also happened on the day of Vasant Panchami
 vasant panchami kaa lahore nivasee vir hakeekat se bhi gaharaa sambandh he
 One day when Mulla ji left school for some work, all the children started playing, but he kept studying
 jab anya bacchon ne use chhedaa, to durga maa kii saughandh di
 Muslim children raised the laugh of Durga Maa
 hakeekat ne kaha ki yadi main tumhaari bibi fatima ke bare main kuch kahuun, to tumhen kaisaa lagegaa? What was it then, as soon as Mulla ji came, those mischievous students complained that he abused Bibi Fatima
 phir to baat badhate hue kaaji tak ja pahunchi
 The same decision was expected during the Muslim rule
 aadesh ho gaya ki yaa to hakeekat musalmaan ban jaye, anyathaa use mrityudand diya jaayegaa
 Reality did not accept this
 parinamat: use talwaar ke ghat utaarne kaa farmaan jari ho gaya
 It is said that on seeing his innocent face, the sword fell from the executioner's hand
 hakeekat ne talwaar uske haath main di or kaha ki jab main baccha hokar apane dharm kaa paalan kar rahaa hum, to tum bade hokar apane dharm se kyon vimukh ho rahe ho? is par jallaad ne dil majboot kar talwaar chalaa di, par us vir kaa sheesh dharti par nahin gira
 He went straight to heaven from the skyway
 yah ghatana vasant panchami ko hi hui thi
 Although Pakistan is a Muslim country, kites are flown on Vasant Panchami in memory of the sky-high head of reality
 hakeekat lahore kaa nivasee tha
 Hence, the greatest emphasis of kite flying is in Lahore
 vasant panchami hamen guru ramsingh kuka kii bhi yaad dilaati he
 He was born in 1816 AD on Vasant Panchami in Bhaini village, Ludhiana
 kuch samay ve ranjit singh kii sena main rahe, phir ghar aakar khetibari main lag gayi, par aadhyatmik pravashtti hone ke kaaran inke pravachan sunne log aane lage
 Gradually, a separate cult of his disciples became, which is known as Kuka Panth
 guru ramsingh goraksha, swadeshi, nari udhdaar, antarjaateey vivaah, samuhik vivaah aadi par bahut jor dete the
 He too first started his independent postal and administration system by boycotting the British rule
 prativarsh makar sankranti par bhaini gaanv main mela lagata tha
 While coming to the fair in 1872, one of his disciples was surrounded by Muslims
 unhone use peeta or govadh kar uske munh main gomance thuns diya
 Hearing this, Guru Ramsingh's disciples were agitated
 unhone us gaanv par hamalaa bol diya, par duusari ore se angrej sena aa gayi
 So the dice of war turned
 is sangharsh main anek kuka vir shahid hue or 68 pakad liye gayi
 50 of these were blown up on seventeen January 1872 in front of a cannon at Malerkotla
 shesh 18 ko agle din faansee di gayi
 Two days later, Guru Ram Singh was also captured and sent to Mandalay jail in Burma
 14 saal tak vahaan kathor atyaachaar sahakar 1885 i
 main unhone apana sharir tyaag diya
 Raja Bhoj Panwar's birthday comes on Vasant Panchami
 raja bhoj is din ek bada utsav karavaate the jisamen puri praja ke liye ek bada pratibhoj rakhaa jaataa tha jo chalis din tak chalata tha
 Vasant Panchami is also the birth anniversary of Amar Vibhuti Mahakavi Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' of Hindi literature
 niraala ji ke man main nirdhanon ke prati apaar prem or pidaa thi
 They used to give their money and clothes to the poor with an open mind
 is kaaran log unhen 'mahapraan' kehete the
 People born on this day go much further if they try
 ye log aage jate he
 Telipali is a village in Raigarh district under Raigarh division of Chhattisgarh state of India
 jagat ke sab panchangon kii utpatti pracheen kaal main dharmik kriyaaon ke samay nishchit karne ke liye hui he
 Later, social festivals and programs of state importance have also been included in them
 hamaare samast pracheen saamaajik utsavon ko bhi dharmik swaroop diya gaya he
 Diverse religions have been practiced in our India for many centuries
 isse hamaare panchang bhi vividh prakaar ke bane hai
 Their main types are Hindu, Islam, Zoroastrian and Christian
 aaj ke hindu panchangon ke bhi kareeb 30 prakaar paae jate hai
 Apart from Hindu almanacs, the subject of mathematics is very less in other almanacs, due to which most of our discussion will be about Hindu almanacs
 at: is lekh main, jahaan anyathaa na kaha gaya ho, vahaan "panchang" shabd se hindu panchang hi samajhnaa chahie
 In addition to celebrations and fasts, astronomical topics are given in our Panchangas, such as eclipses, sunrise, times of favorable events, the position of planets in the sky, etc
 khagolashastra aajkal pashchim main itani unnat sthiti main aa gaya he ki vahaan ke panchangon main die hue khagoleey ghatnaon ke samay akashasthit grahon kii pratyaksh ghatnaon ke saath second tak baraabar mil jate hai or yahan hamaare panchangon kaa ganit itnaa sthool ho gaya he ki unke grahanon main dedh ghante tak kaa antar paaya jaataa he
 The reason for this is that the texts from which our almanacs are made are at least 500 years old and mathematics astrology has grown a lot in the West in these 500 years
 isse hamaare panchangon kaa ganit arbacheen ganit jyotish shaastra se karnaa chahie, jisase vah pratyaksh akaash ke anusaar yatharth utre
 Such mathematics is called "direct" or "equivalent" mathematics or "visual"
 aaj gujarat or maharashtra main samast panchang pratyaksh ganit se banaae jate hai
 But in other states of India, very few almanacs are made by direct mathematics
 kintu keval pratyaksh ganit se hamaare panchangon kaa prashn hal nahin ho saktaa
 Our almanacs are made according to the celestial position of Suryachandra and the position of other planets is also kept in them
 sthiti batalaane kii reeti yah he ki akaash kii ek nishchit rekha ke upar ek nishchit bindu se grahon ke antar naape jate hai ore ye antar panchangon main die jate hai
 That fixed line is called the "revolution", the fixed point as the "starting point" and from there the difference of the planet is called "enjoyment"
 paashchaatyon kaa aarambhsthaan nishchit he or vah vasantsampaat he
 But what is the starting point of our almanac, there is a lot of difference among our pundits about this
 vasantsampaat or hamaare aarambhsthaan ke bich main jo antar he, uski "aynansh" kehete hai
 This means that there is a difference of opinion among our pundits on how much money is there
 aynansh ke nishchay ke bina aarambhsthaan kaa nishchay nahin hota or aarambhsthaan ke nishchay ke bina panchang ban nahin saktaa
 Therefore, Ayansh is an important problem of our almanac
 sayan, nirayan - jis panchang main vasantsampaat ko aarambhsthaan mana jaataa he, usko "sayan" panchang kehete hai or jis panchang main is sampaat ke atirikt kisi or bindu ko aarambhsthaan mana jaataa he, usko "nirayan" panchang kehete hai
 Vasantasampat, Dakshinayan, Sharatsampat and Uttarayan, these four points come from the sequence above the ecliptic with a difference of 90–90 degrees
 surya sthir he, magar prithvi surya ke chaaron or ek varsh main puraa ek chakkar lagaati he
 But we feel confused that the sun is revolving around us
 surya ke is bhasman vaarshik maarg ko "krantivrutt" kehete hai
 On this route, we see the sun traveling from west to east in one year
 do sampaat or do ayan, ye chaar bindu sthir nahin, kintu ye sab vaarshik 50 vikala kii bahut choti gati se satat pashchim kii ore waapas ja rahe hai
 The four events are the basis of all these events, ie seasons, day and night rising, ie when the sun comes near these points, then these events happen
 isse ritu, dinmaan, ityadi sayan varsh ke anusaar hote hai
 The value of a year is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds
 nirayan panchang kaa aarambhsthaan sampaat ke sivaay koi bhi sthir yaa asthir bindu ho saktaa he
 It is better to use the word "nakshatra" in place of "nirayana" for indistinguishability where the static starting place is depicted
 tathaapi "nakshatra" ke arth main "nirayan" shabd bahut prayukt kiya jaataa he
 The stars are fixed, so that the time after the sun moves from a single star, or stationary point, and then the time it reaches that stationary point or star is called the "sidereal" year
 nakshatra varsh kaa maan 365 din, 6 ghante, 9 minute or 10 second he
 The stars are visible and stationary, we can tell them in relation to the celestial location of the planets from the sidereal system
 yah nakshatrapaddati kaa vishesh upyog he
 The sion year is 20 minutes and 24 seconds shorter than the sidereal year
 hamaare puraane dhang ke panchangon main, jo varshmaan liya jaataa he, vah 365 din, 6 ghante, 12 minute or 36 second he
 It is neither pure cyan nor pure sidereal
 yah shuddh sayan varsh se lagbhag 24 minute or shuddh nakshatra varsh se lagbhag minute bada he
 Because of taking this temperature, our seasons and the locations of the planets between the stars, all of them come apart from our direct observation and experience
 aisi sthiti main hamako kya karnaa chahie? is prashn kaa uttar dene ke pehle hamaare liye yah jaan lenaa aavashyak he ki hamaare panchang main koun koun se vishay aate hai
 These are the five parts of Panchang i
e
 Date, War, Nakshatra, Yoga and Karana
 "tithi" purna chandrabimb kaa 15vaan hissaa ore "karan" 30vaan hissaa batalaata he
