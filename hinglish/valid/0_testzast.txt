 Stories like Panchatantra, Hitopadesh, Vetalpanchavinshati are probably taken from this

 Before he began putting his ideas together, he talked with Damon Lindelof, executive producer of LAST, with whom he had worked at the crossing for three years
 Kring thanks Lindelof for his measures in which he explained how to perform the series on the network and gave feedback on the experiences he had learned while working on the series drama
 The two still negotiate and assist each other's projects
 When Kring told the NBC network about Heroes' plan, he described the network's response as "exciting 


 very good
" He says that he has been a partner with NBC for some time based on running Crossing Jordan as a show-runner for six years
 When he narrated the plan, he described everything in depth, including the mysterious ending
 When the NBC officer asked them what was going to happen next, Kring replied "you just wait and find out
" After the project was approved, a special 73-minute version of the first episode was screened in front of a large audience at the 2006 Comic Con in San Diego
 Initially it was stated that this non-proliferated pilot would not be released, yet it was included in the DVD set of the first season

 When the writing team works on an episode, each writer takes a character and writes the lone scenes around it
 These stories are then added and the episodes are given to the writer
 The system allows each writer to contribute to each episode and enables the writing team to finish the script early so that shooting crews can shoot more scenes at one location
 Tim Kring considers the writing process to be collaborative and says that the collaboration process is important because the production has to shoot multiple scenes in one place
 To do this, several scripts must be prepared
 Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explains that this process is important in a series drama because it is important to know in which direction each character is moving

 In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, producer Tim Kring commented on criticisms from the two seasons and a 15% drop in the series' ratings
 Kring said he made mistakes directing season two
 He thought audiences were looking to "develop the characters and discover their powers", as opposed to season one, when viewers were looking for "thrills"
 Kring also stated that he had problems with the development of the story, stating that the second season "took too much time to become a big story", describing that Peter's hypothesis of a final battle from the viral in the first episode rather than the seventh Should have been He believes that in the context of the main story, it would have been better to bring new characters, such as Eli, instead of a separate story of Maya and Alejandro
 Kring also admitted that he was called "heroes in Japan" The story should have ended more quickly and also that the romantic stories are not going well
 With reference to Claire and West and Heroes and Yeko, he said, "I have seen more believable romance on TV
 In that context, i don't think romance is a natural fit for us

 In November 2008, NBC fired Jesse Alexander and Jeff Loeb from the production staff at Heroes due to creative differences and budget problems
 As a result, Tim Kring had to refocus on the development of the characters and the simple story series

 " Regarding the show's closing date, Kring commented that, "the show has not yet been thought of ending

 " Barry Garren of The Hollywood Reporter also stated, "heroes is one of tv's most imaginative creations and, with luck, could become this year's Lost

 Sreebihari ji himself was sleeping there
 shabd sunate hi bihari ji nikal bhaage
 But they left their chudas and wanshi on the bed
 swami ji, vruddh avasthaa main drushti jeern hone ke kaaran unakon kuch najar nahin aay
 After this, when the priest of Shri Bankebihariji temple opened the doors of the temple, when the priest of Shri Bankevihariji temple opened the doors of the temple, he could not see the sarcasm and wiggle in the face of shribankebihari Ji
 kintu mandir kaa darwaja band tha
 Surprised, the priest came to Swamiji at Nidhivan and told Swamiji all the things
 swami ji bole ki praatavkaal koi mere panlag par soya hua tha

 The world will go to heaven for bondage, so she starts crying near Sribihari ji, "O Lord, i am going home, but you stay with me forever, after praying, both of them will go towards the railway station
" Sitting in a horse cart walked
 us samay shribankevihari ji ek gop balak kaa rup dhaaran kar ghodagadee ke peeche aakar unako saath lekar le jane ke liye bhaktimati se prarthana karne lage
 Here, the priest not knowing Thakur ji in the temple, he came to know about the love incident of Bhaktimati and immediately he ran behind the horse cart
 gaadi main balak rupi shribankebihari ji se prarthana karne lage
 While having such a conversation between the two, that child disappeared from their midst
 tab pujari ji mandir lautakar pun shribankebihari ji ke darshan karne lage
 Here, both the devotee and Bhaktimati, knowing the kindness of Sribakebihari himself, both gave up their movement of the world and dedicated their lives at the feet of Sribakebihari
 aise hi anekon kaaran se shribankebihari ji ke jhalak darshan arthath jhaanki darshan hote hai
 There is a curtain on the front door of the temple Shri Sibihari and that curtain is closed and opened at an interval of two minutes and there is another legend
 ek baar ek bhakt dekhtaa rahaa ki uski bhakthi ke vasheebhoot hokar shribankebihari ji bhaag gayi
 When the priest opened the doors of the temple, he did not see shribankebihari
 pataa chalaa ki ve apane ek bhakt kii gavaahi dene aligarh chale gayi hai
 Since then it has been made such a rule that the curtain of Thakur ji will be opened and closed in Jhalak Darshan

 At one time a devout nobleman appeared for his darshan

 baad main bihari ji ke goswamiyon ko pataa lagane par unka peechha kiya or bahut anunay-vinay kar thakurji ko lautaa-kar shrimandir main padhraya
 Therefore, a tableau philosophy of Bihari ji was arranged so that no one could fight his eyes
 yahan ek vilakshan baat yah he ki yahan mangal aarti nahin hoti
 The Gosaias here say that Thakurji sleeps at night in the morning, tired at night
 us samay inhen jagaanaa uchit nahin he
 The faith of the people is so much that one of the devotees who came to see the last Ashwin Shukla Panchami, who could not see anything with eyes, just inquired Baba that you are unable to see, yet have come to see Bihari ji
 unhone uttar diya lala mujhe nahin dikhataa he,par bihari ji mujhe dekh rahe hai

 Daly's father, lawyer Raghunath Mishra, known by all as 'lawyer Saab', rushes to Omi's hideout with his men
 or omi ke sar pe pistaul taante hue daali ko chhodane kii dhamkee dete hai
 But at the very moment, Bhaisab calls for stopping the bloodshed by calling the current political situation by breaking phone tensions between the two
 agle din raghunatha apni beti ko chhudaane ke liye bhaisaab par dabaav banaate hai
 But the real issue opens up to Dolly's own father when Dolly willingly accepts Omi and falsifies his forced leadership
 or is nirnay ke kaarnon kii ghatana ek-ek kar vajah bataati hai
 Dolly's father is broken by shame and betrayal
 yahaan nirdeshak kathanak main mode daalane ke liye mul rachana 'othelo' kaa hi zikr karte he, jahaan daali ke pita omi ko samajhaate hai 'bahubali ! aurat ke tricharitra ko mat bhoolanaa
 Who can cheat his father and what will he be like? omi ab raajnneetik shadyantron ke bich duusare pratidwandvi jaise indore singh or surendra captain ko chunaav main bhaag lene se rokane ke liye ms sex scandel jaise hatkande apnaane yaa unhen hi mitaane kaa kaam karata hai

 or phir party ke nae 'bahubali' ke rikt pad ke liye omi tab langadaa ke tamaam raajnneetik gatividhiyon ke anubhav ke baavjood keshu ko nayaa daavedaar ghoshit karata hai
 With the dry decision of Omi, the lame finds himself feeling disrespected and envious of Keshu because according to him Keshu is inexperienced as well as irresponsible even if he is educated and popular among the youth
 is apmaan kaa badla lene ke liye vah keshu ko shubhakamanaayen dene ke bahaane sharaab pine ko phusalaata he, jiske nashe se keshu unmaadi hokar rajju or mehmaanon se jhagad padataa he
 Omi gets to know Keshu's handiwork, which causes Omi to doubt his decision
 yahaan langadaa ek haath se keshu ko daali kii puraani dosti ke naate omi se sulah karwaane ko kahata he to duje haath vah omi ko daali or keshu ke bich sandigdh rishte kii managasaint kahani sunaata he
 Meanwhile, the gifts received by Omi are missing the 'waistband' in Dolly, which Indu hides in her house
 langadaa ko jab yah baat maaloom hoti he to vah isi kamarband ke jariye kaiyon ke man main vishwaas-avishvaas ke ghere main daal detaa hai
 Meanwhile, there is a fatal attack on Tiwari Bhaisahab by Kichlu, who is the man of his rival Indore Singh
 omi badla lene kii thaanta hai, to langadaa ab vahi kamarband keshu ko billo chamanbahaar ke jariye kichlu ko dundh nikaalane or use markar omi se shaabaashi paane kii yukti detaa he
 But here too, the situation remains opposite to Keshu because the lame trick the Omi by saying how the waistband of Dolly reached Keshu's mashuka billo? Did Dolly intentionally hand over the waistband to Keshu? Omi comes to the house in disgust and questions Daly but he himself does not know why Omi is behaving rudely with him
 a few days before the wedding, seeing Omi and Dolly's love waning, Indu senses Omi's apprehensive mind to stop the wedding and taunts Dolly to take over
 is bich omi ko langadaa saath bhaisahab kii ore se indore singh ko maarane kaa aadesh miltaa he, kaam ko anjaam dene baad omi vahiin langadaa ko peetate hue kahata he ki vah daali or keshu ke bich sandigdhta kaa pramaan de anyathaa maamla jhutha sabit hone par apni jaan ganvaaen
 On the wedding night, Lame confirms all of Omi's misgivings with his mischief that Dolly and Keshu have a truly illicit relationship
 omi is jhuthi bevafaayee se gussaye apni hi suhagaraat main badi crurata se daali ko maar detaa hai to vahiin langadaa apni bandook se omi ke aadesh par keshu ko goli maar detaa hai
 Dali, who is scared by the sound of the explosion, is shocked to find Daly dead when she enters Omi's room
 par vahiin maujud kamarband ko pahchaan indu kahati he kii yah to usne churaayaa tha
 Now both of them understand that the reason for the responsibility of all these people is lame who misled everyone in their crooked ways
 vishwasadhatt or tabaahi se gussai indu apane pati langadaa kii gardan dauli se kaat detii he to vahiin khud ko thaga or laachaar omi, ghayal keshu ke pahunchate hi khud ko goli maar aatmahatya karata he
 At the last sight, the helpless Keshu sees the swinging soulless doll and the dead Omi lying below

 Charcoal, or Kathkoyla or charcoal, is a black-brown, impermeable, solid substance that is made by heating wood, bone, etc
 in the absence of oxygen and extracting water and other volatile substances from it
 is kriya ko "ushmavighatan" kehete hai
 Charcoal contains high amounts of carbon
 yah lakdi ko 400 °C se 700 °C tak hawa kii anupasthiti main garam karke banaaya jaataa he
 Its calorigenic value ranges from 29,000 to 35,000 kj / kg, which is much higher than the calorigenic value of wood
 charcol kaa upyog dhaatukarm main eendhan ke rup main, audyogic eendhan ke rup main, khaane banane ke indhan ke rup main, barood nirmaan ke liye, shuddhikaran or filtaran ke liye, kalakaari, chikitsa, aadi ke liye kiya jaataa he

 Where this variable is preserved it also has a fixed address that tells where the value of the variable is preserved in memory
 is pate ko hi pointer kehete hai
 The c / c ++ programming language also has the feature that the address of a variable can be determined
 c / C++ programmen bhashaa main bhi char kaa pataa jaanane ke liye & kaa upyog karte hai
 For example, if there is an integer variable x, the address of x will match with & x
 jis prakaar purnank, akshar, vaastavik sankhya ityadi ko char main sangrakshit kiya jaataa hai usee tarah kisi char ke pattey ko bhi
 For this, a new datatype is used to preserve the address in the same way that int datatype is used to preserve integers
 kisi purnank char kaa pataa sangrakshit karne ke liye int* datatype kaa upyog karte hai
 Similarly, characters use char * datatype to preserve the address of a variable
 neeche ek chota sa udhaaharan yah diya gaya he jisamen ek char main duusare char kaa pataa sangrakshit karte hai
 Here first an integer variable x is defined, then p is defined a variable that preserves the address of an integer
 phir p char main x kaa pataa daal diya he
 Address → 0 1 2 3 4 Memory → 1 xxrep 4 0 111 11100101 00100110 xxrep 4 0 101 01100101
 
 
 ↑ p = & x = 3 int x Now the variable is an integer pointer p in which the address of variable x is preserved, that is, the address of x will be written when p is written
 yadi hamen yah jaananaa he ki p main jis memory kaa pataa likhaa hua us memory par kya sangrakshit he to *p kaa upyog karte hai karne ke liye hame ek main function avashya likhnaa hota he
 Because 'C' compiler starts executing any program from main function
 ek sanchika athwa ek program main ek se adhik main function nahin ho sakate
 It is an user defined function
 main function ko ’{’ koshthak dwaara aarambh kiya jaataa he
 At the time of execution of the program file '{' indicates that the execution has to start from here
 isi prakaar ’}’ yah bataata he ki nishpaadan yahan samaapt hona he
 In a program, the main function remains the same, but other functions can be used
 prayek function ke liye { or }ke madhya upaprogram diya jaataa he
 End semicolon of each instruction ';' Must be by is program ko chalaane par iskaa output nimnavat hoga: Another example 133 to 135 °C, expressant truti: agyaat shabd "to"
 K, expression error: unknown word "to"
 °F Urea is an organic compound with the chemical formula 2CO
 carbonic rasayan ke kshetra main ise carbamide bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is a colorless, odorless, white, rusty poisonous solid substance
 yah jal main ati viley he
 It is found in the urine of mammals and reptile creatures
 krishi main nitrogenyukt rasinic khaad ke rup main iskaa upyog hota he
 Urea was first discovered in urine by French scientist Hilary Roule in 1773, but the credit of first making urea by artificial method goes to German scientist Wöhler
 inhone silver isosynet se uria kaa nirmaan kiya tathaa sweden ke vaigyanik barjelius ke ek patr likhaa ki maine vrikk kii sahaayta liye bina kritrim vidhi se uria bana liya he
 At that time, the theory of Bergeles was believed in the whole world that organic compounds like urea cannot be formed outside the bodies of living beings and they require life power to make them
 bade paimaane par uria kaa utpaadan drav ammonia tathaa drav carbon daai-oxide kii pratikriya se hota he
 Urea is used to increase the fertility of soil
 iskaa prayog vaahanon ke pradooshan niyantrak ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa he
 It is used in making urea-formaldehyde, rangin, plastic and hydrazine
 isse uria-stebamin naamak kaala-jaar kii dawa banati he
 It is used in making sleep medicine called Veronel
 cedative ke rup main upyog hone vaali dawaaon ke banane main bhi iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Urea production in India was around 20 million tonnes in 2008-2009, while the actual consumption was around 24 million tonnes
 40 lakh ton kii atirikt jarurat ko uria ke aayaat ke jariye puraa kiya gaya tha
 But domestic fertilizer companies can invest five to six billion dollars to increase their urea production capacity in the next four years, which is expected to increase the country's urea production capacity by six million tonnes
 uria utpaadan kshamta main vistaar ke baad bharat uria ayatak ke bajaay niryaat karne vaale desh main tabdeel ho jayega
 The multi-faceted form of advertising developed today on the World Plank has a long story behind it
 uski prishthbhumi vishwa ke pracheen itihaas main samaai hui he
