 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he

 ISO 9000: 1994 emphasized quality assurance through preventive actions rather than merely examining the final product and demanding evidence of compliance with documented procedures
 The only drawback with the first version was that the tendency of companies to implement its requirements was by filling the strings with working manuals and burdening iso's bureaucracy

 An ISO certificate is not an award once and for all, but must be renewed at regular intervals, usually around three years, as suggested by the certification body
 There is no class of capacity within ISO 9001 compared to the capacity maturity model
 😂😂 Two types of auditing are required to be registered with the standard: auditing by an external certification body and auditing by trained internal staff for this process
 samiksha or moolyankan kii ek nirantar prakriya hi iskaa lakshya he jiske tahat - yah satyapit kiya jaataa he ki system usee tarah kaam kar rahaa he jis tarah se ise karnaa chahie, pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki isamen kahaan sudhaar ho saktaa he or pahachaani gai samasyaon ko sahi yaa rokthaam kiya jaataa he
 It is considered beneficial for internal auditors when they conduct audits outside their general management line to bring a degree of freedom to their decision
 1994 ke maanak ke tahat, lekha-pareekshan kii prakriya ko paryaapt rup se "anupaalan lekha-pareekshan" kaa pradarshan karke sambodhit kiya ja saktaa tha: The 2000 standard uses a different approach
 lekha-pareekshakon se jokhim, sthiti or mahatv par prakaash daalkar "anupaalan" ko kanthsth karne kii keval lekha-pareekshan ke paar jane kii ummid kii jaati he
 This means that they are expected to pay more attention to what is formally determined, rather than just following what is effective
 Its difference from the previous standard can be explained as follows: lekha-pareekshan ke liye ISO 19011 kaa maanak anya prabandhan pranaaliyon, jaise - EMS, FSMS ityadi, ke atirikt ISO 9001 main bhi lagu hota he
 The ISO 9001 standard is generalized and abstract

 saamanytah ISO 9000 kii prabhaavashiltaa par bahes kaa centre nimnlikhit prashn hai: It has been widely accepted that proper quality management often improves business by having a positive impact on investment, share marketing, sales growth, sales margins, competitive advantage and avoidance of litigation
 vade, or barns ke anusaar ISO 9000:2000 ke gunvattta siddhant bhi bahut achche hai, jo kehete hai "ISO 9000 ke disha-nirdesh gunvattta prabandhan pranaaliyon ke liye ek vyapak model pradaan karte hai jo kisi bhi company ko pratispardhi bana sakate hai
 "barnes also cites a survey by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance which indicated that ISO 9000 increased net profit, and he cites another survey cited by deloitte-touch that reported that registration The cost was recovered in three years
 providence bijnes news ke anusaar ISO kaa karyanvayan nimnlikhit laabh pradaan karata he: However, a comprehensive statistical study of 800 Spanish companies showed that ISO 9000 registration itself improves slightly as companies interested in it generally already make some such commitment to quality management
 And she was performing just like that before registration
 ISO 9001 kii ek aam aalochana panjikaran ke liye aavashyak dhanrashi, samay or kagaji kaarywahi he
 According to Barnes, "opponents claim that this is for documentation only
 samarthakon kaa maananaa he ki agar ek company ne apni gunvattta pranaaliyon ko pralekhith kiya he, to adhikansh kagaji kaarywahi pehle se hi puri ho chuki he
 " ISO 9001 kisi bhi tarah se is baat kaa sanket nahin he ki isaki pramanit pranaaliyon ke istemaal se utpaadit utpaada kisi bhi tarah se achche hai
 a company may intend to produce a product of poor quality and with consistent and proper documentation stamped to ISO 9001
 ceddan ke anusaar, ISO 9001 samaj or sudhaar ke bajaay vinirdesan, niyantran or karypranaliyon ko badhaava detaa he
 Wade argues that ISO 9000 is effective as a guideline, but by promoting it as a standard "it helps to mislead companies into thinking that certification means better quality, 


 which makes the organization Require setting their own quality standards
 " savistaar ke taur par, vade kaa tark he ki ISO 9001 ke vinirdeshnon par bharosa karne se ek safal gunvattta pranali kii guarantee nahin milti he
 Despite being internationally recognized, most American consumers are not aware of ISO 9000 and it holds some significance for them
 pramanit karne or uske baad pramaan patr kaa rakrakhaav karne kii atirikt laagat ko uchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he agar utpaada ke antim upyogkartaaon ko ISO 9000 kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 In fact this cost may cause a company to face a competitive disadvantage when competing against a non ISO 9000 certified company
 is maanak ko khaskar vifaltaa ke khatre ke rup main dekha jaataa he jab ek company kii ruchi gunvattta se pehle pramann main ho
 vastav main pramann aksar gunvattta main sudhaar lene kii ichha ke bajaay graahak ke sanvidatmak aavashyaktaaon par aadhaarit hote hai
 "if you just want to see the certificate on the wall, then maybe, you will build a paper system that doesn't require you to do much the way you want to run your business," Roger of ISO Frost said
 Certification by an independent auditor is often seen as a problem area and according to Barnes "has become a means of increasing consulting services
 " vastav main, ISO khud salaah detaa he ki ISO 9001 ko pramann ke bina, keval gunvattta ke laabh ke liye jise hasil kiya ja saktaa he, lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Another reported problem is the competition between several certification bodies, which leads to an intuitive view of the defects observed in operating a firm's quality system

 Like other states of Rajasthan, coins were in circulation in Mewar, but in economic life, all transactions were not done through coins only

 Another mint was opened in Udaipur in 1774 AD
 isi prakaar bhilwara kii taksaal 17 veen shatabdi ke purv se hi sthaneey vaanijya- vyapaar ke liye "bhilwari sikke' dhalati thi
 Later, at the mints of the three places of Chittorgarh, Udaipur and Bhilwara, Shah Alam's name was inscribed
 atah yah "alamshahi' sikkon ke rup main prasiddh hua
 From the time of Rana Sangram Singh II, the coins of low silver Mewari coins started circulating in place of these coins
 ye sikke chittodi or udaipuri sikke kahe gayi
 Alamshahi coins were priced higher
 100 alamshahi sikke = 125 chittodi sikke The price of Udaipuri coin was less than Chittori
 aantarik ashaanti, akaal or maratha atikaraman ke kaaran rana arisingh ke kaal main chaandi kaa utpaadan kam ho gaya
 Imports halted
 waisi sthiti main rajya- koshagaar main sangrahit chaandi se naye sikke dhaale gayi, jo arsishahi sikke ke naam se jane gayi
 Their value was 1 arsi shahi sikaa = 1 chittodi sikaa = 1 rupaya 4 aana 6 paisa
 During the era of Rana Bhim Singh, the Marathas started valuing their outstanding amounts on the basis of Salimshahi coins
 inkaa mulya tha --- Salimshahi 1 rupee = Chittori 1 rupee 8 annas aarthik kathinaayee ke samaadhaan ke liye salimshahi mulya ke baraabar mulya vaale sikke kaa prachlan kiya gaya, jinhen "chandodi- sikke' ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 All the above coins were made by mixing certain quantities of silver, copper and other metals
 anupaat main chaandi kii maatra tambe se bahut zyada hoti thi
 In addition to these coins, coins of Trishulia, Dhigala and Bhiladi Tobe also became popular
 1805 -1870 ke bich salumbar jaagir dwaara "padmashahi' dhigala sikaa chalaaya gaya, vahiin bhindar jaagir main maharaja joravarasingh ne "bhindriya' chalaaya
 The recognition of these coins was limited to Jagir transactions
 maratha- atikaraman kaal ke "mehta' pradhan ne "mehtaashahee' mudra chalaaya, jo badi simit sankhya main milte hai
 Rana Swaroop Singh tried to get a scientific coin

 Thus we find that the economic system here, the tradition of barter and the effect of rural environment on public life limited the need for currency

 The state of Mewar did not have a well-organized communication system like today

 19 veen sadi ke purvarddh tak isi rudhigat vyavastha kaa prayog kiya gaya
 After this, buggies for information communication also started working
 ab likhit soochna kaa prachlan shuru ho gaya tha
 But there was still no state-based system of information exchange among the masses
 yah vyavastha rana swarupasingh ke shashan se aarambh hui, jo niyamit rajkeey dak laane le jane kaa kaary karti thi
 This system was known as "bamani - postal system"
 bamani dak vyavastha sambhawatah bengal ke harkara- dak vyavastha se prabhavit thi
 In this system, the Brahmins were given postal responsibility on an annual contract basis
 brahman varg ke prati logon kaa aadar va dayaa maan tha
 Simultaneously, since killing or robbing a Brahmin was considered a sin-deed, money and letters were more secure
 theke main haani hone kii sthiti main rajya dwaara aarthik- anudaan kar kshatipurti kiya jaataa tha
 The contracting person had to be employed to maintain the postal system, whose monthly salary was fixed

 This postal system was opened during the rule of Rana Shambhusinh for public use
 jan- saadhaaran ko prati patr kii keemat ke aadhaar par ek nishchit laagat chukaani padati thi
 The cost of exchange of letters within the state of Mewar was fixed, but the money sent out to the post was charged separately for each copy

 There was no separate post office

 Modern historians consider the history of this religion to be a few thousand years old, based on archaeological investigations such as Harappa, Mehrgarh
 jahaan bharat kii sindhu ghati sabhyataa main hindu dharm ke kai chihn milte hai
 Statues of an unknown mother goddess, postures of deity like Lord Shiva Pashupati, Shivling, worship of Peepal, etc

 According to another view, the people of Indus Valley Civilization were Aryans themselves and their original place was India
 aaryon kii sabhyataa ko vaidic sabhyataa kehete hai
 According to the first view, the Aryans settled in Afghanistan, Kashmir, Punjab and Haryana in around 1700 BC
 tabhi se wo log apane devataaon ko prasann karne ke liye vaidic sanskrit main mantra rachane lage
 The first four Vedas were composed, of which Rigveda was the first

 buddha or dharmon ke alag ho jane ke baad vaidic dharm main kaafii parivartan aayaa
 New gods and new philosophies emerged
 is tarah aadhunik hindu dharm kaa janm hua
 According to another view, Hinduism probably has its origins in the Indian tradition even before the Indus Saraswati tradition
 bharatvarsh ko pracheen rishiyon ne "hindusthan" naam diya tha, jiskaa apbhransh "hindustan" he
 According to "jupiter Agam": "hindu" shabd "sindhu" se bana mana jaataa he

 According to another view, the first letter of the Himalayas, "hi" and the last letter "indu" of Indu, these two letters formed the word "hindu" and this land was called Hindusthan
 hindu shabd us samay dharm ke bajaay rashtriyata ke rup main prayukt hota tha
 Since at that time there were only people who believed in Vedic religion in India, but no other religion had emerged till then, so the word "hindu" was used for all Indians
 bharat main keval vaidic dharmavalambiyon ke basane ke kaaran kaalaantar main videshiyon ne is shabd ko dharm ke sandarbh main prayog karnaa shuru kar diya

 hinduon kaa koi kendriya carch yaa dharmsanghathan nahin he or na hi koi "pope"
 Many beliefs and sects come under it and equal reverence is given to all
 dharmagranth bhi kai hai
 Nevertheless, the main principles, which most Hindus believe, believe in all these: religion, karma, worldly cycle of rebirth, salvation and of course, God
 hindu dharm swarg or narak ko asthaayee maanata he
 According to Hinduism, all beings in the world have a soul
 manushya hi aisa praani he jo is lok main paap or punya, dono karm bhoga saktaa he or moksh praapt kar saktaa he
 There are four main sects in Hinduism: Vaishnavism, Shaiva, Shakta and Smarta
 lekin zyaadaatar hindu swayan ko kisi bhi sampradaay main vargeekrut nahin karte hai
 In ancient times and medieval times, Shaiva, Shakta and Vaishnava used to fight among themselves
 jinhen madhyakaal ke santon ne samanvit karne kii safal koshish kii or sabhi sampradaayon ko paraspar ashrith bataaya
 In short, the main elements of Hinduism are the following: Hinduism - Hinduism - who? - Goshu Bhaktibhavedyasya Pranave ch steadha matih
 punarjanmani vishwaasah sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath-- gomata main jisaki bhakthi ho, pranav jiskaa poojya mantra ho, punarjanm main jiskaa vishwaas ho--vahi hindu he
 According to Merutantra episode 33, 'hinam Dushyati sa Hindu' means one who considers Hin to be corrupt

 The culture or religion which has not originated and developed on the land of India, how can that religion or culture be Indian
 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc
 ye sabhi devtaa puraanon main ullikhit hai or unki kul sankhya 33 koti bataayi jaati he
 According to the Puranas, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are not ordinary gods, but Mahadev and are members of the Trimurti
 in sabake alaava hindu dharm main gaay ko bhi mata ke rup main puja jaataa he
 It is believed that the cow has a total of 33 Koti Devi gods
 hindu dharm manyataon main paanch pramukh devtaa poojaneey he
 These are different forms and powers of one God
 devataaon ke guru brihaspati maane gaye hai
 According to mythological beliefs, he was the son of Maharishi Angira
 bhagwaan shiv ke kathin tap se unhone devguru kaa pad paaya
 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus

 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples

 Varanasi is often referred to with adjectives like 'city of temples', 'religious capital of India', 'city of Lord Shiva', 'city of lamps', 'city of knowledge'
 prasiddh amareeki lekhak mark twain likhte hai: "banaras itihaas se bhi puraatan he, paramparaon se purana he, kinvadantiyon se bhi pracheen he or jab in sabko ekatra kar den, to us sangrah se bhi doguna pracheen he
 " varanasi naam kaa udgam sambhawatah yahaan kii do sthaneey nadiyon varuna nadi evam asi nadi ke naam se milakar bana he
 These rivers come from the north and south respectively in the Ganges river
 naam kaa ek anya vichaar varuna nadi ke naam se hi aata he jise sambhawatah pracheen kaal main varnasi hi kaha jaataa hoga or isi se shahar ko naam mila
 There may be some early lessons in support of this, but the historians do not consider this second idea to be correct
 lambey kaal se varanasi ko avimukt kshetra, anand-kaanan, mahashmashaan, surandhan, brahmavart, sudarshan, ramya, evam kaashi naam se bhi sambodhit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The city has been called Kashi or Kasi in the Rigveda
 ise prakashit shabd se liya gaya he, jiskaa abhipraay shahar ke aitihaasik str se he, kyonki ye shahar sadaa se gyaan, shiksha evam samskruti kaa kendra rahaa he

 The glory of the city is stated in 15,000 verses in the Kashi Khand of Skanda Purana

 The Agni river derives the Asi River and is also called Nasi

 In the Mahabharata, the ancient name of Varuna or modern Barna river is confirmed as Varanasi

 In ancient times, cities used to get names in the name of trees as well, like Kosambi to Kaushambi, Rohit to Rohtik etc
 atah yah sambhav he ki varanasi or varanavati donon kaa hi naam is vriksh vishesh ko lekar hi padaa ho
 For the above reason of the name Varanasi, it should not be inferred that from the above discussion of this city it should not be understood that this capital city of Kashi State had only one name
 akele buddha sahitya main hi iske anek naam milte hai
 Surudhan in Udaya Jataka, Sudarshan in Sutasom Jataka, Brahmavardhana in Somandak Jataka, Pushpavati in Khandhal Jataka, Ramm Nagar in Yuvanjaya Jataka, Molino names in Shankh Jataka
 ise casinagar or casipur ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 Its capital was named Potali in the time of Emperor Ashoka
 yah nishchay purvak nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki ye sabhi naam ek hi shahar ke the, yaa kaashi rajya kii alag-alag samay par raheen ek se adhik rajdhaniyon ke naam the
 According to mythology, the city of Kashi was founded by the Hindu Lord Shiva about 5000 years ago, due to which it is an important pilgrimage site today
 ye hinduon kii pavitra saptpuriyon main se ek he
 This city is mentioned in many Hindu texts including Skanda Purana, Ramayana, Mahabharata and the oldest Vedas Rigveda
 saamanyatya varanasi shahar ko lagbhag 3000 varsh pracheen mana jaataa he
 , But according to Hindu traditions, Kashi is considered more ancient than this
 nagar malamal or reshmi kapadon, itron, hathi daant or shilp kala ke liye vyapaarik evam audyogic kendra rahaa he
 During the era of Gautama Buddha, Varanasi used to be the capital of Kashi state
 prasiddh chini yatri hwain tsang ne nagar ko dharmik, shaikshanik evam kalatmak gatividhiyon kaa kendra bataaya he or iskaa vistaar ganga nadi ke kinare 5 kimi tak likhaa he
 Since time immemorial in Kashi, many great personalities have been born or inhabited
 inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: Varanasi became an independent Kashi state in the 18th century and under the later British rule, it remained a major trading and religious center
 1910 main british prashasan ne varanasi ko ek nayaa bhartiya rajya banaaya or ramnagar ko iskaa mukhyalay banaaya, kintu iskaa adhikaar kshetra kuch nahin tha
 The King of Kashi still lives in the Ramnagar Fort
 ye kila varanasi nagar ke purv main ganga ke tat par bana hua he
 The Ramnagar Fort was built by Kashi Naresh Raja Balwant Singh in the 18th century by Uttam Chunar Sandstone
 kila mughal sthapaty style main nakkashidaar chazzon, khule praangan or suramya gumbaddaar mandapon se susajjit bana he
 Another palace of Kashi Naresh is Chait Singh Mahal
 ye shivala ghat ke nikat maharaja chait singh ne banwaaya tha
 The Ramnagar Fort and its museum are now preserved in the historical heritage of the kings of Banaras and have been the official residence of the King of Kashi since the 18th century
 aaj bhi kaashi naresh nagar ke logon main sammanit hai
 They are considered to be the religious presidents of the city and people here consider them to be an avatar of Lord Shiva

 ise hindu manyata main sabase bada tirth mana jaataa he, kintu tirth ke rup main varanasi kaa sabase purana ullekh mahabharat me miltaa he
 There is no mention of any pilgrimage etc
 in any pre-mahabharata literature
 aaj ke tirthasthal tab adhiktar van pradesh main the or manushyon se rahit the
 The Adivasis must have lived somewhere
 kalantar main tirthon ke bare main kahi gayi kathaayen astitva main aayin or tirth badhate gayi, jinke aasapaas nagar or shahar bhi based
 The existence and significance of pilgrimages was revealed by the spread of Aryans in Bharatbhoomi
 mahabharat main ullekh he prithvi ke kuch sthaan punyaprad tathaa pavitra hote he
 Some of these have become sacred due to the strangeness of the place, some by the influence of birth and some by the contact of sages and sages
 yajurvedic jabal upanishad main kaashi ke vishay main mahatvapurn varnan aata he, parantu is upanishad ko aadhunik vidwaan utana pracheen nahin maanate hai
 In jabal-upanishad Block-2, Maharishi Atri asked Maharishi Yajnavalkya how to know the latent and eternal God
 tab yajyavlky ne kaha ki us avyakt or anant aatma kii upasna avimukt kshetra main ho sakati he, kyonki vah vahiin pratishthit he
 And on asking the status of Atri's liberation
 yajyavlky ne uttar diya ki vah varna tathaa nashi nadiyon ke madhya main he
 Asking what that Varana is and what that intoxicant is, the answer was received by asking that the sensed Varana is the varana to remove all the faults and Indra Kriti is the destroyer of all sins
 vah avimukt kshetra devataaon kaa dev sthaan or sabhi praaniyon kaa brahm sadan he
 It is here that Lord Rudra teaches the Taraka Mantra during the time of human beings' life, due to which he attains salvation by becoming immortal
 at ev avimukt main sadaiv nivas karnaa chahie
 Never leave him, Yajnavalkya has said
 jaabalopinashad ke alaava anek smritiyon jaise likhitasmriti, shringismriti tathaa parasharasmriti, brahmisanhita tathaa sanatkumarasamhita main bhi kaashi kaa mahatmaya bataaya he
 In almost all the Puranas, the greatness of Kashi has been said
 brahmavaivart puraana main to kaashi kshetra par kaashi-rahasy naam se puraa granth hi he, jise uskaa khil bhaag kehete hai
 In the Padma Purana, kashi-mahatmya and other places also mention Kashi
 pracheen ling puraana main solah adhyay kaashi kii tirthon ke sambandh main the
 There is also a chapter in the current Lingpurana
 skanda puraana kaa kashikhand to kaashi ke tirth-swarup kaa vivechan tathaa vistrut varnan karata hi he
 Thus there is material on religious significance of Kashi in Purana literature
 iske atirikt, sanskrit-vadmay, dashakumarcharit, naishadh, rajtarangini or kuttanipatam main bhi kaashi kaa varnan aata he
 The Linga Purana, which took place till the 12th century AD, had detailed descriptions of the deviyanas and pilgrimages of Kashi from the third to the eighteenth chapter
 tristhalisetu granth kii rachana main lingapurana vaisaa hi rahaa tha
 That is, in the Lingpurana also, the lingo is described from the third to the sixteenth chapter
 vartmaan ling puraana main keval ek hi adhyay kaashi ke vishay main he, jisamen keval 144 shloke hai
 Thus, if all the Puranas are mentioned except Mahabharata, then the list of mention of Kashi's pilgrimage form becomes very long
 shabdakalpadrum me 264 tirthon kaa ullekh he, parantu mahima ke vichaar se bharat ke tirthon main chaar dham or saptpuriyon ke naam sheershasth maane jate he
 The names of Prayag, Gaya and Gangasagar do not come in them

 Numerous mythological quotations are available for the expansion of the Varanasi region
 krityakalpataru main diye tirth-vivechan va anya pracheen granthon ke anusaar: It is known from the above quotes that the expansion of ancient Varanasi was very far
 varuna ke pashchim main rajghat kaa kila jahaan pracheen varanasi ke based hone main koi andeh nahin he, ek mile lanbaa or 400 gaj chaudaa he
 The river Ganges protects its southeast mouth and the Varuna river protects the north and north-east mouths as a shallow trench, an empty drain on the west side through which the river Varuna once flowed
 raksha ke is prakritik sadhano ko dekhte hue hi shaayad pracheen kaal main varanasi nagar ke liye yah sthaan chunaa gaya
 During the first Indian freedom struggle in 1857, the British also fortified the city by raising the walls of raw mud on the high ground behind Varuna to protect the city
 puraanon main aayi varanasi kii seemaa rajghat kii ukt lambaai-chaudaai se kahin adhik he
 From those accounts, it seems that not only the boundary of the city is described, but the entire region has been included
 varuna ke us paar tak pracheen basaavaton ke avshesh kaaphi dur tak milte hai
 So it is possible that all those parts found in the Puranas have also come
 is kshetra ko yadi nagar main judaa hua maane, to puraanon main varnit nagar kii lambaai-chaudaai lagbhag sahi hi bataayi gai he
