 ye sachche arth main kisaan netaa the jinaki aguai main pipra evam turakuliya nilhi kothiyon se sambaddh hajaaron kisaan nilhe saahabon ke atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke viruddh nirnaayak aandolan par utar gayi the
 Congress leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi came to Champaran in 1917 to bring the said movement to a decisive point, which was called 'baba' here and returned as Mahatma Gandhi
 gandhi ji ne 15 april 1917 ko champaran aagaman ke baad apana kaary prarambh karne ke liye babu sahib ko hi chuunaa tha
 On the morning of 16 April, i left for Jasoli where a crackdown was taken to crush the peasant movement
 gandhi ji ke liye us samay champaran main jasauli se adhik upyukt dharti nahin thi jahaan ve satyagrah kaa beej daal saken
 Gandhiji's visit to Jasauli raised the ears of not only Neelihs but also the District Administration and the then British Government and banning his visit, the then Collector Mr
 Hekauk ordered him to leave the district
 gandhi ji apane dhun ke pakke the tathaa babu lomraj singh bhi apane iraade ke majboot
 The government's ban did not hinder anyone's purpose
 gandhi ji raste main chandrahia ke paas se swayan sarkaar se nibatane ke liye jila mukhyalay motihaari laut gaye lekin unhone apane sahyogi ramanavami prasad, dharanidhar prasad donon vakil tathaa anya ko champaran satyagrah kaa sutarapaat karne ke liye jasauli bheja
 Babu Saheb brought him to Jasoli
 jahaan unalogon ne babu sahib ke viruddh kii gai damanaatmak kaaravaayiyon ko dekha tathaa champaran satyagrah kaa sutarapaat karte hue unheen ke daravaaje par kisaano kaa pehla bayaan darj kar ek pothee banaai jo aage chalakar maheene bhar main champaran satyagrah kaa potha ho gayi
 In which Karun Katha of atrocities on farmers was recorded
 babu lomraj singh ne 1857 ke pratham swatantraaa sangram ”sipaahi vidroh“ ko ubharate tathaa vifal hote dekha tha
 After defeating Bettiah Raj and taking land on lease from it, the Nilheen Sahabs were seen emerging, grinding innocent farmers into their oppression mill and supporting the power of the government with this injustice and their soul was awakened
 unke andar virodh kii chinagaari foot rahi thi lekin ve use sholaa banane kaa avasar dekh rahe the
 They were gathering power and gathering public confidence
 is bich angrajon se loha lene ke liye vartmaan pashchimi champaran ke kisaan shaikh gulab or sheethal raay, pirmohammad munish aadi uthe lekin unhen dabaa diya gaya
 Champaran at that time lacked education and in their absence the struggle was not successful
 koi padhaa-likhaa vyakti angrejon ke khilaaf aage nahin aa rahaa tha
 In the meantime, Pt
 Rajkumar Shukla became a victim of the suppression of Mr
 Aiman
 pan0 shukla ne jab virodh kaa jhanda uthaaya to unhen babu lomraj singh kii shakti mil gayi
 Babu Saheb had been fighting a legal battle with the British for a long time but he was not getting proper success
 mukademen main dhan kaa apvyay bhi seemaa chhu rahi thi jisamen babu sahib ko apane motihaari ke vakil toli kaa shahari awaas vakil sahib kii fees main hi ganvaana padaa tha
 But in the meantime, they were able to organize a large gathering near the Mithua Var of Kotwa village by uniting the farmers of Turkouliya and Pipra Kothi region
 unhone tirhut kamishnar ko saat sau kisaanon ke hastakshar ke yukt bade hue lagaan ke viruddh chinagaari ko sholaa bana liya lekin vah tab dhadhaka jab aandolan main pan0 raaj kumaar shukla shaamil ho gayi tathaa babu sahib ke vakil babu gorakh prasad kii buddhi usamen mil gayi
 Gorakh Babu himself informed these people about the work done by Gandhi in South Africa and suggested that if they come to see the situation in Champaran, then it will also be saved
 iske liye pan0 shukla ke netritv main kisaanon kaa ek jattha champaran se lakhanu congress main bhaag lene gaya jisamen babu lomraj singh ne tan-man-dhan se sahyog kiya
 How Gandhiji came to Champaran is well known, but it is buried in the pages of history that after Gandhi's pain, Babu Lomraj Singh was preparing to return after changing his program by writing a letter to Magan Lal
 There were men who told Gandhiji that they had lost everything they had, if Gandhi did not go to Champaran, he would commit suicide by jumping into the Ganges river
 Sector but public confidence lost will not Champaran and Gandhi had come to change your mind Champaran up again which is also known
 champaran agrerian act gandhi ke champaran satyagrah ke saath babu lomraj singh ke kisaan aandolan kii safalataa thi
 Babu Lomraj Singh's great helpers were his cousin Bhikhu Singh, who had left the British and plunged into the peasant movement
 angrrej saahabon ke patr tathaa sarkari prativednon se gyaat hota he ki pipra or turakuliya kothi ke saahabon par in dono bhaiyon kaa khauf tha
 He was so popular among his people that people started calling Sooraj Singh to Lomraj Singh
 pipra ke sahib mi0 normen ne colector mi0 hekuk ko bataaya tha ki psoraj ke viruddh koi gavaah milanaa mushkil he or collector lomraj singh kii itani lokapriyata kii jaankaree apane patr dwaara adhikariyon ko di thi tathaa champaran main kisaan aandolan bhadakne kii sthiti ko rekhaankit kiya tha
 Babu Saheb's morale became high when Pt
 Rajkumar Shukla departed from time to bring Gandhiji to Calcutta
 isi samay jagirahaan kothi kaa sahab mi0 comp bhi inkaa manobal todane inke saamne aa gaya
 Then on receiving information about the British men cutting bamboo from their Banswari, Babu Saheb went unarmed to stop them and a public outcry followed them
 jisapar mi0 camp ghode dauda-dauda kode barasaane laga
 When Babu Saheb challenged, people dropped him from the horse and beat him Bhojpuri, threw sticks in his body
 isamen angrejon ne apane astitv ke viroddh chunauti maani tathaa jasauli main palaton bhej kar tabaahi machaayi, mukademen kiye
 Babu Saheb was released in the case but in that case Makhan Singh, Visun Singh, Triveni Singh, Rajadhari Rai, Ramphal Rai, Mahingan Kuwar were rightfully sentenced from Buxar Jail
 babu sahib ke achche sahyogi baaraa kaa dev parivaar tha
 Babu Saheb and his brother Bhikhu Singh do not fight the British on their own, they have received the blessings of financial help to other fighting farmers
 babu lomraj singh ne patane main gandhi ji ko kiya gaya vaada 18 apraul 1917 ko motihaari ke kachhari main mukademen kii sunwaayee ke dauraan pipra or turakuliya kshetra ke 10 hajaar kisaanon ko samarthan main jamaa kar nibhaayaa
 Babu Saheb had the same credit that when Mahatma Gandhi came to see the barbaric earthquake in 1934, he searched for him and Pt
 Shukla, but by then they had become obsessed
 babu sahib ne swatantraaa to nahin dekhi lekin unke kisaan aandolan kaa prabhaav hua ki nilhon ko betia raaj ko lij lautaa kar bhaagna padaa
 Mr
 Camp broke his house but could not get his horse built by his entry, but Babu Lomraj Singh broke his cell and got his toilet built from his brick before dying

 chhandashastra isaliye atyant pusht shaastra mana jaataa he kyonki vah ganit par aadhaarit he
 In fact, it seems that the scripture has been designed so that the advance child can make verses based on its rules
 chandashastra ke granthon ko dekhne se yah bhi gyaat hota he ki jahaan ek ore acharya prastaaradi ke dwaara chando ko viksit karte rahe vahiin duusari ore kavigan apni ore se chhandon main kinchit parirvan karte hue naveen chhandon kii sristi karte rahe jinka chandashastra ke grathon main kalantar main samavesh ho gaya

 are also used in abundance
 ek anya kinvadanti yah he ki chandashastra ke aadi aavishkarta bhagavan shesh hai
 Once Garuda caught him

 chaturbhimkare bhujangprayati arthath chaar ganon se bhujang prayaat chand banataa he or prayukt hota he
 In this way, the emergence of metaphysics
 isse prathit hota he
 That metaphysics appeared as a divine discipline
 is prakaar bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki iske aavishkkarta shesh naamak koi acharya the jinke vishay main is samay kuch vishesh gyaan or soochna nahin he
 After this, Shesha is said to have taken an avatar and composed Chhandasutra as Pingalacharya, which is called Pingalashastra
 yah granth sutarastyli main likhaa gaya he or is samay tak uplabdh he
 Commentaries and explanations have been done on this
 yahi chandashastra kaa sarvapratham granth mana jaataa he
 After this, many texts were written in Sanskrit literature on this scripture
 chandashastra ke rachiyataaon ko do shreniyon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he : ek acharya shrenee, jo chandashastra kaa shastreey nirupan karti he or duusari kavi shrenee, jo chandashastra par pruthak rachanaayen prastut karti he
 Shortly afterward, an author category appeared and which included such writers who interpret the verses of the verses on their own, but cite examples from other composed and popular passages
 hindi main bhi chandashastra par anek granth likhe gaye hai
 The two main topics of thought in the scripture are: chand mukhyat: do prakaar ke hai : Whose Prayong is found in the Vedas
 inamen hrasv, deergh, plut or swarit, in chaar prakaar ke swaron kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he, yatha "anushtup" ityadi
 Vedic verses are considered apaurusheya
 inkaa prayog saahatyantargat kiya jaataa hai, kintu vastut: loukik chand ve chand hai jinka prachaar saamaanya lok athwa janasamudaay main rahata he
 These verses are not based on any fixed rules, but are especially based on rhythm and rhythm, so they are composed by the normal unread people
 loukik chhandon se taatpary hota he un chhandon se jinaki rachana nishchit niyamon ke aadhaar par hoti he or jinka prayog supathit kavi kavyadi rachana main karte hai
 The scripture-related rules of these temporal verses are systematically laid down in the scripture is known as metaphysics
 chhandon kaa vibhaajan varnon or matraaon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 The verses are first considered to be of two types: Varnic and Matric
 inamen vritton kii sankhya nishchit rahati he
 There are also two types of it - negative and non-negative
 ganaatmak vanink chhandon ko vrutt bhi kehete hai
 Their composition is based on the Ganas made of three short and long ganas
 laghu tathaa deergh ke vichaar se yadi varnon k prastaaravyavastha kii jaae aath rup banate hai
 These are called "eight ganas", in which B, N, M, y are considered auspicious and J, R, S, t are considered inauspicious
 vaakya ke aadi main pratham chaar ganon kaa prayog uchit he, antim chaar kaa prayog nishiddh he
 If you want to use only the verses starting with inauspicious Ganas, you should use the word Devatavachi or Mangalavachi or the first word - it removes Ganodosh
 in ganon main paraspar mitra, shatru or udasin bhav mana gaya he
 The combination of two ganas is considered in the beginning of the verses
 varnon ke laghu evam deergh maanane kaa bhi niyam he
 Short vowels or characters with one volume are considered to be short or descent and one volume is considered
 deergh swaron se yukt sanyukt varnon se purv kaa laghu varna bhi visarg yukt or anuswaar varna tathaa chand kaa varna deergh mana jaataa he
 Negative chromatic circles are those in which the idea of ganas is not kept, only the idea of a fixed number of varnas is kept
 In particular mathematical verses only the definite idea of quantities is kept and it is based on a particular rhythm or tempo
 isaliye ye chand laypradhan hote hai
 Varnic verses are kept according to the Varnas
 teen varnon ke samooh ko gana kehete hai
 The names of these ganas are: Yagan, Magan, Tagan, Ragan, Jagan, Bhagana, Nagan and Sagana
 akele laghu ko ‘l’ or guru ko ‘ga’ kehete hai
 The following formula is helpful to know what order of the minor guru in which gana- jis gana ko jaananaa ho uskaa varna is main dekhakar agle do varna or saath jod lete hai or usee kram se gana kii matraayen laga lete hai, jaise: They are called Adilaghu or Adiguru, based on the only quantity in quantities
 jisamen sab guru he, vah ‘magan’ sarvaguru kahalaaya or sabhi laghu hone se ‘nagan’ sarvalaghu kahalaaya
 In Sanskrit, most of the alphabetic verses are taught; Less than mere verses
 sanskrit main is kaa naam 'dohadika' chand he
 There are thirteen-thirteen in its odd stages and eleven-eleven in even stages
 visham charnon ke aadi main
 ऽ
 is prakaar kaa maatra-kram nahin hona chahie or ant main guru or laghu varna hone chahie
 The rhyme of even steps should be found among themselves
 jaise: This couplet has been marked with both odd and even steps in the first line
 isi prakaar duusari pankti main bhi aap donon charnon par ye chihn laga sakate hai
 Therefore, Doha is a semiscriptive meter
 harigitika chand main prayek charan main 28 matraayen hoti hai or ant main laghu or phir guru varna avashya hona chahie
 Yeti is followed by 16 and 12 quantities; like is chand main prayek charan main chhbbees matraayen hoti hai or 14 tathaa 12 matraaon ke baad yeti hoti he
 like: chhandon kaa vibhaajan matraaon or varnon kii charan-bhed-sambandhi vibhinn sankhyaon par aadhaarit he
 In this way the verses are even, odd, half-hearted
 sam chhandon main chand ke chaaron charnon main varnaswarasankhya samaan rahati he
 The first, third and second and fourth alphabet numbers in Ardhasam remain the same
 visham chand ke chaaron charnon main varnon evam swaron kii sankhya asmaan rahati he
 These characters are mutually distinct, and after a certain number of letters and quantities, verses consisting of a majority of letters and vowels are called dandaks
 inaki sankhya bahut adhik he
 The verses can then be divided in other ways as well
 swatantra chand or mishrit chand
 The independent verse is composed by the same rule
 mishrit chand do prakaar ke he : The frequency of the fourth phase of the couplet is added to the first phase of the couplet by joining the couplet and rolla, and the initial few words of the couplet are placed at the end of the roll
 duusare prakaar kaa mishrit chand he "chappay" jisamen chaar charan rola ke dekar do ullala ke die jate hai
 That is why it is called Shaxtadi or Chappay
 inke dekhne se yah gyaat hota he ki chhandon kaa vikaas na keval prastaar ke aadhaar par hi hua he varan kaviyon ke dwaara chand-mishran-vidhi ke aadhaar par bhi hua he
 Similarly, some verses have come in the form of the opposite form of a single verse, as the opposite of couplets is Soratha
 aisa prathit hota he ki kaviyon ne bahudhaa isi ek chand main do ek varna athwa maatra badha ghataakar bhi chand main roopaantar kar nayaa chand banaaya he
 This stanza may fall under the passage
 laghu chhandon ko chhodkar bade chhandon kaa ek charan jab ek baar main puraa nahin padhaa ja saktaa, usamen rachana ke rukne kaa sthaan nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 This break is called Yeti
 yeti ke vichaar se chand phir do prakaar ke ho jate hai- The whole idea of elegance is laid out by the musical element in the verses
 praaia: sabhi chand kisi na kisi rup main gey ho jate hai
 Not all verses with raga and ragini can be said in verses
 isi liye "geeti" naam se katipay pad rache jate hai
 Often, in musical terms, the vowel mount and the descent are often shortened to short, long to short and short to short
 kabhi kabhi hindi ke chhandon main deergh e or o jaise swaron ke laghu roopon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he

 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana

 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom

 Jinnah's differences with the Congress began at the same time when Gandhiji emerged in Indian politics in 1918
 gandhiji ne raajnneeti main ahimsaatmak savinay avagya or hindu mulyon ko badhaava diya
 According to Gandhiji, freedom and self-government can be found by truth, non-violence and civil disobedience, whereas Jinnah's opinion differed from them
 jinna kaa maananaa tha ki sirf sanvaidhanik sangharsh se hi aazaadee pai ja sakati he
 
 Unlike other Congress leaders, Gandhiji did not wear foreign clothes, used Hindi more and more in place of English and Sanatan used Hindu thinking in politics
 yahi kuch kaaran the ki gandhiji ko apaar lokapriyata mili
 Gandhiji supported the Khilafat movement while Jinnah openly opposed it
 jinna maanate the ki isse dharmik kattarta ko badhaava milegaa
 Jinnah resigned from Congress in 1920
 iske saath hi, unhone yah bhi chetavanee di ki gandhiji ke jansangharsh kaa siddhant hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich vibhaajan ko badhaayegaa kam nahin karegaa

 The leaders of the Muslim League - Aga Khan, Chaudhary Rahmat Ali and Mohammad Allama Iqbal - repeatedly urged Jinnah to return to India and take charge of the reconstituted Muslim League

 However, in this election, he had to face severe defeats in Muslim dominated Punjab, Sindh and North West Frontier Province
 jinna ne congress ko gathbandhan ke liye aamantrit kiya
 At first they both decided that they would face the British together, but Jinnah stipulated that the Congress would have to consider a separate constituency for Muslims and the Muslim League as representative of the Muslims of India, which the Congress rejected
 congress main us samay kai muslim netaa the, isliye lig ko bhartiya musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi maananaa uske liye aasaan nahin tha
 Jinnah also held talks with several Congress leaders and the Congress also proposed to merge the League into Congress, but the talks nevertheless failed

 In a speech by the Muslim League in 1930, Mohammad Iqbal gave the North West Indian state of India, not the country of Pakistan
 rahamat ali ne 1933 main parche chhapakar us alag desh kaa naam pakistan rakh diya
 After negotiations with the Congress failed, Jinnah also got the idea that Muslims should have to find a separate country to protect their rights without it working
 aage chalakar jinna kaa yah vichaar bilkul pakkaa ho gaya ki hindu or musalmaan donon alag-alag desh ke naagarik hai at: unhen alahada kar diya jaye
 His idea was later called Jinnah's theory of dualism

 Jinnah also raised this point in correspondence with Iqbal
