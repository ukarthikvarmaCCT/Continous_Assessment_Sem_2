 Due to the influence of the means of communication, the impact of this fast spread throughout India and in support of it people started taking to the streets
 inhone bharat sarkaar se ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi lokapal vidheyak banane kii maang kii thi or apni maang ke anuroop sarkaar ko lokapal bill kaa ek masauda bhi diya tha
 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 sarkaar ne isaki raah main kai rode atkaaye evam 16 agast ko anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But this led to agitation in the entire country
 desh bhar main agle 12 dilon tak lagaataar badi sankhya main dharna, pradarshan or anshan yojit kiye gaye
 Finally, on August 28, Anna announced the postponement of his fast after the Parliament passed the proposal of concurrence on three terms of Anna
 5 april 2011 ko ek shashakt lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan kii maang par sarkari niskriyata ke pratirodh main anna hajaare ne aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev and many other famous social workers were involved in this campaign against corruption
 sarkaar ne ise upekshit karnaa jari rakhaa
 This fast began to be published and circulated widely in the media of India and soon
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jari is koshish ko sheeghra hi vyapak jansamarthan milane laga
 In almost all the cities of India, the youth took to the streets and demonstrated in support of it and distributed pamphlets
 anna hajaare ke anshan ke deshvyapee jan aandolan ke rup main fail jane se chintit sarkaar ne janalokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye jhatpat ek samiti kii ghoshnaa kii
 It also agreed to pass a strong Lokpal Bill in Parliament before 16 August
 is tarah yah anshan samaapt hua or bhrashtachar ke viruddh panapata jan andolan majboot lokapal ke nirmaan kii aashaa ke saath samaapt hua
 But the government's intent was doubtful, so Anna Hazare also announced that if the expected Lokpal Bill is not produced by the next 15 August, then he will go on a fast from 16 August
 april main kiye gaye anna hajaare ke anshan kii samaapti kii sharton ke anuroop sarkaar ne 10 sadasyeey lokapal masauda nirmaan samiti ke nirmaan kii ghoshnaa kii

 anna hajaare ne sarkaar ke sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii baadhyataa vaale tark kaa virodh na karte hue kisi mantri ko samiti kaa adhyaksh hona sweekaar kar liya
 But the ministers of this committee headed by Kapil Sibal did their own arbitrariness
 pradhanmantri or nyaayadhishon ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke mudde par naagarik samaaj ke pratinidhiyon or sarkaar ke bich virodh bana rahaa
 Kapil Sibal said that civil society opinion will not be taken to make law in future
 antat mantriyon ne anna hajaare dwaara prastut jan lokapal ke sabhi mahatvapurn sujhaavon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 All the points of the Jan Lokpal were accepted for showing, which kept the government ministers and mps, and the judges out of the reach of the Lokpal
 antat sarkari mantriyon ke ravaiye se niraash anna hajaare ke saathiyon ne jan lokapal kaa masauda alag se nirmit kiya
 And thus the committee produced two drafts which were placed before the Union Cabinet
 vahaan bhi mantriyon ke masaude ko to purnatah prastut kiya gaya kintu jan lokapal kaa saransh rakhaa gaya
 And as expected, the cabinet adopted the draft ministers and agreed to present it in Parliament
 4 agast 2011 ko sansad main lokapal vidheyak prastut kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister was kept out of its purview during his tenure in the government's Lokpal Bill
 lekin sabhi bhootpurv pradhanmantri iske daayre main rakhe gaye the
 Accordingly, the Lokpal will be a committee headed by a current or retired judge

 The time limit for investigation was kept at seven years

 Wherever the administration takes him, his fast will be there, "we will sit on a hunger strike in jail, taken there and if left again, we will come back to JP Park
 " August 16 was the day of the test of Indian power and the power of the people

 unhone inkulab jindabad or bharat mata kii jai ke naare ke saath apane samarthakon kaa josh badhaayaa
 Anna said while addressing the supporters "1947 main adhuri aazaadee mili
 The movement for independence gained in 1947 started in 1942 and now from August 16 another freedom struggle has started, which you have to reach the end
 anna rahe yaa na rahe lekin bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yah mashaal jalati rahani chahie
 i thank all of you who have been sitting outside the jail for 4 days and appeal to the children, old and young, to reach Ramlila Maidan in maximum numbers
 koi todfodaur rashtriya sampatti ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaen or trephic kaa puraa dhyaan rakhen
 He will talk to them only on the Ramlila ground
 " After conveying the message to the supporters, Anna Hazare left for Mayapuri in a procession
 khule trek main anna ke juluus ke saath- saath hajaaron logon kii bheed haath main tirangaa liye unke saath paidal march kar rahi thi
 Such a scene has rarely been seen on the streets of Delhi, when the public moved forward with slogans holding slogans in the heavy rain

 angrej chale gaye, lekin bhrashtachar khatm nahin hua
 Therefore, the second fight for independence has started
 desh ke sabhi logon ne mere bhai, meri bahan, yuva - yuvatiyon ne yah jo mashaal jalaai he, is mashaal ko kabhi bujhane nahin dena
 The torch will continue to burn even if Anna Hazare remains
 abhi ek lokapal nahin is desh main puraa parivartan laana he
 We have to think how we will be able to give the palace to the poor affairs of the country
 kranti kii shuruyaat hochuki he
 i will not say much today because in the last three days my weight has reduced by 3 kg, but you are getting the energy of the movement you are running in the country
 ' Many countries have been made by youths, i am sure the youth of this country has awakened and now the future of this country is bright

 log baapu kaa priyabhajan raghupati raghav raja ram gaayen or saansadon se puuchhen ki lokapal par unki raay kya he
 He is with the government ombudsman or with the Jan Lokpal
 kyonki aap logon ne unhen vot diya he
 it's your right
 arvind kejariwal ne jaananaa chaha ki pradhanmantri bataaen ki sarkaar se kis jagah or kahaan baat kerani he
 He added further to Anna's talk that besides the mps, people should also go outside the houses of ministers and mlas in Delhi and picket and ask those people what their opinion is
 22 agast ko subah se shaam tak logon kaa saansadon or mantriyon ke gharon ke saamne jaakar pradarshan karne kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 Police also detained 50 people after demonstrating in front of Union Minister Kapil Sibal's house
 is andolan ko aage badhaane or kharchon ke liye paisa jutaney ke liye ramlila maidan main banaae gaye daan shivi par bhi logon kii lambii qatari lagi rahi
 Be it children or elderly, rich or poor, everyone was donating to this movement according to his capacity

 The rich businessman, who was distributing food and drink in a truck or a laborer who was busy in cleaning the Ramlila Maidan, all were coming here on a call of Anna to the country of their own free will
 anshan ke saatven din anna kaa vajan 5 kilo kam ho gaya
 Ketones started coming in his blood and urine
 lekin unka utsaah purvavat hi bana rahaa
 Concerned over the deterioration of his health and its political impact, the government appointed Pranab Mukherjee to hold talks
 pehle daur kii vaarta kaaphi sakaaratmak rahi
 Anna supporters differed on three issues and three terms were to be considered
 sarkari vaartakaron ne iske liye agle din subah tak kaa samay liya
 Dr
 Naresh Trehan had advised Anna Hazare to drip after checking the health of Anna Hazare on the evening of Tuesday 23 August but he also refused
 raat ko logon ko sambodhit karte hue anna ne kaha ki dopaher ke baad doctoron ne kaha tha ki kidney main kuch samasya aa gai he or unhen drip ke zarie dawa deni hogi
 i told the doctors that i would listen to my conscience and tell what i would do
 meri antaratma kah rahi he ki tu ye kya kah rahaa he ki dil diya he, jaan bhi denge or jaan dene se darataa he
 

 So i have told the doctors that my conscience is saying that no medicine is to be taken
 mai mar gaya to parvaah nahin, mere baad kitne anna khadey ho gaye hai
 If something happens to their kidneys, then one of the thousands of people will give them the kidney
 doctor kii report ke baad sarkaar bhi kuch sochane lagegi or agar sarkaar kii ore se unhen jabardastee uthaakar le jane ke prayaas honto saare darwaazon par log khadey ho jaaen or mujhe le jane na dena
 "the government's position changed overnight and on 24 August it withdrew from the consensus reached yesterday
 usne jan lokapal vidheyak ko sansad main prastut karne se inkaar kar diya or anna ke anshan ko unki samasya bataaya
 The possibility of forcibly lifting Anna from the hunger strike also increased
 24 agast buudhvaar kii shaam ko samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue anna hazaare ne kaha- "do not commit violence 


 i will not tolerate violence
 agar main jail jaaun to aap log saansadon ke ghar par virodh jataao
 Do not do any harm to national property
 agar police aati he to main kushi se jail jaaoongaa
 or kal se sabko jail baro andolan karnaa he
 The country has to be saved from the path of non-violence
 ye azaadiki duusari ladaai he
 The government's attitude is not dictatorial, but dictatorship
 ye lokshahi ke liye bahut bada khatara he lekin meri vinati he ki agar sarkaar mujhe yahaan seuthae to use koi roke nahin
 Now i have understood the tricks of the government
 sarkaar chaahati he ki andolan ko todane ke liye aap log hinsa karen
 So we all have to be restrained
 "25 agast ko anshan ke 10wein din ramlila maidan main anna hajaare ne kaha ki "meraa vajan sirf 6
5 kilogram kam hua he
 The rest is fine
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki main jan lokapal vidheyak paarit hone tak nahin maruunga
 i am getting a lot of energy from you
 " Demonstrations across the country continued for the tenth consecutive day in support of Anna Hazare
 lagaataar duusare din logon ne pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 50 of them were taken into custody
 ahimsaatmak pradarshnon se ghabaraai sarkaar kii suraksha ke naam par par dilli police ne pradhanmantri awaas ke najadik ke chaar metro steshnon- huda city centre or jahangirpuri ke bich sthit udyog bhawan, res course or jor baag tathaa kendriya sachivalay se badarpur maarg par khan market metro stesan ko dopaher teen baje se band karvaa diya
 In an interaction with Anna Hazare's representatives and the government, the Prime Minister said while trying to calm the deadlock that arose on August 24, the government is ready to discuss the bill and government bill of Aruna Rai including Jan Lokpal in the House
 bhrashtachar ke masale par loksabhaa main charchaa kii gai
 The Lok Sabha, including the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, unanimously appealed to Anna Hazare to end his fast
 iske baad kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogikimantri vilasarav deshmukh ne ramlila maidan jaakar anna hajaare ko sabhi partiyon tathaa sansad kii ore se bheja gaya patr diya or unase anshan samaapt karne kaa aagrah kiya
 On the proposal of getting the Jan Lokpal including Aruna Rai's Bill and the Government Bill discussed in the House, Anna said that "if the discussion on the Jan Lokpal Bill starts in Parliament, we will consider breaking our fast
" lekin hamaari teen mukhya maange hai
 Appointment of Lokayukta in states, bringing lower level officers also under the purview of Lokpal and make a citizen charter
 yah teenon garibon ke liye hai
 Their fast will continue until there is a consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on these issues
 pradhanmantri or puri sansad dwaara apane swasthya par chintaa jataae jane par apni pratikriya dete hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki "iske liye ham unhen dhanyavad dete hai
 But he was worried about my health today
 anna ke swasthya kii chintaa he unhen to vah 10 dinon se kahaan the
 Actually, the concern is those who have come here
 air condishan main baithne waalon ko anna ke swasthya kii chintaa nahin he
 "anna wrote to the Prime Minister in a letter to Vilasrao that-" We have great respect for our Parliament, our Parliament is the holy temple of our democracy
 " main anshan par apane kisi swaarth ke liye nahin baitha, jis tarah se aap log desh kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahe hai usee tarah se main bhi desh ke logon ke bare main hi sochataa rahata hoon
 i have no power of any kind
 main ek bahut saamaanya aadmi hoon or samaaj va garib janata ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana rakhata hoon
 Our movement is not against any person or party
 ham bhrashtachar ke kilaaf hai
 We want to change the corrupt system
 yadi hamaare andolan ke dauraan mere athwa mere kisi saathi ke dwaara kuch aise shabd kahe gaye kiye gaye hon jisase aapako yaa kisi anya vyakti ko chot pahaunchi ho to main ham sabaki taraf se dilgir vyakt karata hoon
 It is not our goal to hurt anyone
 har rajya main isi kaanoon ke zarie lokayukta bhi banaae jaaen, har vibhaag main jan samasyaon ke liye citizans charter banaae jaae jise na maanane par sambandhit adhikari par karrwai ho or teesraa ye ki centre sarkaar ke upar se neeche tak sabhi karmchaariyon or rajya ke sabhi karmchaariyon ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae
 Can a motion be brought to Parliament on these three things? i have no hope that all our mps will be ready at the beginning to rid the people of the country of corruption every day
 My conscience says that if these things are agreed in Parliament, then i should break my fast
 " The rest of the Jan Lokpal bill, such as the selection process, is also very important to prevent corruption
 main meri janata ke saath tab tak ramlila maidan main baitha rahoonga jab tak baaqi saare muddon par sansad main nirnay nahin ho jaataa kyonki yahi janata kii awaz he
 So many people have joined me all over the country in the hope that they will get rid of corruption
 iske liye jaruri he ki rajyon main bhi lokayukta ke gathan ke liye kanoon paas ho
 There should be a system to fight against the corruption of the officials, who have to face two-four daily corruption
 isi tarah sabhi sarkari sevaaon ke liye samaysima tay ho or unhen samay par puraa nahin karne vaale adhikari par jurmaana lage
 This letter of Anna was also discussed at the Anna Hazare Prime Minister's residence, but the attitude of the government remained the same the next day
 
 With this, the government had prepared a section of media through advertisements and other means which was now trying to justify their favor

 Despite this the movement was continuing and the government was under increasing pressure

 In the past, it is being understood that the coming out of an ombudsman law will get rid of corruption, but it is wrong, just by enacting an ombudsman law will not end corruption, but it will have to find solutions to many more challenges
 Kiran Bedi wrote on Twitter that, "it may not be enough for an ombudsman to get started
" "rahul gandhi ke bayaan se acroshit anna hajaare ke samarthakon ne shuukravaar ko unke tughlaq road sthit awaas ke baahar pradarshnakia or jamkar narebaaji kii

 On 27 August, the government debated Anna's three main demands in Parliament
 
 By 8 o'clock in the night, both the houses of Parliament passed a resolution to send it to the Standing Committee to consider these conditions by voice
 sansad ke donon sadanon main shanivaar ko lokapal mudde par anna hajaare kii maangon ke anuroop laae gaye prastaav par saidhantik rup se sahmati banane ke baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa patr lekar kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri vilasarav deshmukh, saansad sandip dikshit or purv kendriya mantri vilaas mutemvaar ne anna ko ramlila maidan pahunchakar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare addressed the supporters and said, "jan Lokpal has won this half

 This is the victory of the entire youth power

 This is the victory of social organization

 "I want to end my fast in the presence of you all at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, that too with your permission
 aap jashn jarur manaaen lekin dhyaan rakhen ki isse shanti bhang na ho or kisi ko pareshaani na ho
 Anna ended the fast on 28 August by drinking honey-mixed coconut water at the hands of Simran, a five-year-old girl from the Dalit community of Sundernagri, and Iqra, a Muslim from Turkman Gate

 This proposal would not have passed without the cooperation of the parties
 We thank them

 The laws in Parliament were made according to the wishes of the people

 After breaking the fast, Anna thanked the people of the country, especially the youth, media, police and doctors for their care in making the movement successful and said that "they have just postponed their fast but their fight will continue

 But many subjects had not yet been agreed

 Keeping in mind the re-talks with Anna's colleagues in the morning, late night the Prime Minister called an emergency meeting on the Anna issue and discussed it with senior ministers

 But the result of all these exercises came to the contrary on 24 August
 sarkaar kaa rukh bilkul badal gaya tha
 After a conversation with Pranab Mukherjee, Prashant Bhushan said that the government's stand was very positive in the talks held on Tuesday, but on Wednesday everything looked like a revenge
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar ne saafe kar diya he ki wo jan lokapal bill ko pesh nahin karegi
 Kiran Bedi said that Pranab Mukherjee appeared in a rage as soon as the meeting started on Wednesday and he was saying that you should keep doing it
 anna ke anshan ke bare main sarkaar ne kaha ki wo unki yani naagarik samaaj or anna hazaare kii samasya he

 But the government was not making its stand clear

 Anna's weight had decreased by seven and a half kilos due to the 13-day fast

 Doctor Trehan, who has been continuously checking Anna's health for 13 days, said that Anna's body is deficient in water and he has become very weak
 unke swasthya par nazar rakhane ke liye unhen kuch dinon ke liye gudgaanv ke ek aspataal main bhartee kar liya gaya
 The whole country was engulfed in celebration with the announcement of Anna's demands in Parliament on 27 August and Anna's announcement of ending the fast on 28 August

 Rizwan Zaheer Usman was an Indian litterateur and dramatist from Rajasthan
 ve hindi ke aadhunik naatakakaron main apni moulik naatakeeyata ke kaaran jane jate hai
 He has contributed a lifetime in the fields of art, literature, storytelling, and drama, besides writing over 100 stories and 150 plays
 unhone kareeb dedh sau se adhik naatakon kaa manchan va pradarshan kiya or swayan abhinay karte 50 se adhik naatakon kaa nirdesan bhi kiya
 He has been awarded the 'life Time Achievement Award' for theatrical writing and direction by the Sangeet Natak Akademi
 sahitya academy dwaara naatak ’kalpana pishaach’ ke liye 'devilal saamar natya lekhan puraskaar’ diya ja chukaa he
 The best drama 'vahi Hain Dare Tha Titli Kon' was awarded in the Poorvanki play-writing organized by Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur
 kidney kii samasya ke kaaran lambi beemaari ke baad unke paitruk nivas bhoot-mahal mohalle main hathipol udaipur main unka nidhan ho gaya
 Usman was a modern / post-modern painter in true sense, whose immersion was often conflated with burning questions of politics if his theatrical vision drew inspiration from modern literature, especially poems
 osman multah rajnatik mantavyon ke natya-shilpi the or unka paksh spasht – ki naatak mahaz manoranjan kii vidha nahin, uskaa ek sandesh bhi he, maanav-samvednaa ke parishkar ke paksh main ek saafe-suthra uddeshy bhi 
 He was a director and writer with deep understanding of man's destiny and location
 vidmbana, asamanta, hinsa, hatya, shoshan, laalach, vaasana, irshyaa, poonjeevaad, sanhaar, yuddh unke liye sirf shabd nahin the- in sab ke natya-pratik osman ne apane naatakon main itani bhinnata se rache ki dekh kar tajjub main pad janaa hota he
 He had his own insights on history, tradition and culture, and despite being a minority, his entire writing was completely free from all kinds of limited communalism, petty religious-animosity and social-reprisal
 naatak banane sochane likhane or manch par laane kii unki ek khaas 'style' thi, or unki style kii nakal lagbhag asambhav
 Not only the dramatics of his theatrical experiments and his plays, the characters and even his name seem to be expressing Osman's infatuation of his extremely original signatures
 tota, kores, aad, chhathi indriya, hakkaa, paise vaali party, lebar, igo, yoddha, divangat dadajan, mamaa, bahut bada saanp xxrep 8 
 aadi osman ke‘paatro’ main shumaar hai
 Every character has its own story and character - every character is a necessary character in the play and its own place in the plot is unequaled
 ‘rajasthan sahitya academy’ udaipur ne inke kuch naatakon- 'akhet-katha', ,'anhad naad' donon sahi, donon galat', 'bansi tailor', 'bheed', 'chandrasingh gadhwali', 'chalaang' 'din main aadhi raat', 'ekatarfa yatayaat', 'lomadiyaan', ' maan kaa betaa or kataar vaale nartak', 'mere gunahon ko bachche maaf karen', 'putr', 'raham dil saudagar', 'yahan ek jangal tha shriman' ko ‘madhumati’ main samay-samay par prakashit kiya he
 inke nidhan ke kuch samay pashchaat academy ne inke ek mahatvapurn rangamanchi naatak ‘‘akhet-katha’’ ko prakashit kiya tha
 Some of his critics were accused of: Many of Osman's plays contain scenes of bloodshed, slaughter, violence, murder, etc
 and murder tools - knife, mace, dagger, ax, hunter, sword, gun, cannon, handgrenade, revolver
 , Time bomb carbines, ak-47s, pistols, bombs etc
 and even the display of such perverted conditions on the ancient Indian 'natyashastra' theater, especially the slaughtering has been considered as 'cast'
 kintu osman ke pakshdhar samalochak likhte hai- bharat muni kaa apekshaakrit sanyat santulit saumnasy bharaa tatkaaleen samaaj or aaj kaa hamaara samaaj, kya har tarah se bhinn samaaj nahin he? bharat muni ke 'naatyashaastra' ke itane saalon baad kya aadhunik-jivan ke yatharth ko vyakt karne ke liye hinsa bhi aaj nae theatre main koi achhut-sandarbh rah saktaa he? kya hamaara cinema hinsa ke drishyon se sarvatha mukt he? kya aaj ke samaaj ke rangamanch par vaastavik jivan main hinsa ke kai spasht or prachhnn rup hamen rose-rose tandav karte nahin dikh rahe? kya samakaleen jivan-style kii swarthparakata, apadhapi, galaa-kaat pratiyogita, taang-khinchaai, ochhi-pratispardhaa, aadi hamen dikhalaai nahin de rahi?

 a person who has just spent a lot of money on a new car feels that his or her new car is much less likely to go bad than someone else's old car

 The most well-known case in earlier studies of cognitive dissonance was defined by Leon Festinger and others in a book called Wayne Profici Fells
 in lekhakon ne ek samooh main ghuspaith kii jo yah ummid kar rahaan tha ki is dharti kaa vinaash ek nishchit taarikh main asann he
 When that prediction failed, the movement developed rather than disintegrated, with members vying to prove their fanaticism for which they hired converts
 sangyanatmak asangati kaa ek anya udhaaharan he ben franklin prabhaav
 franklin ne ek anugrah kii maang karke ek raajnneetik pratidwandvi par jeet hasil kii oe ve use is prakaar varnit karte hai: My goal is not to receive his grace by honoring his sycophancy, but after some time, i adopted this other method
 Hearing that there was some very rare and unique book in his library, i wrote him a note, in which i expressed my desire to receive that book and insisted that he give it to me for a few days by giving it to me Please He immediately sent the book and i returned it with another note in a week, in which i expressed my feeling for the charity he had done
 jab ham agali baar house main mili, unhone mujhase baat kii or vah bhi bahut sabhyataa ke saath; or uske baad bhi unhone sabhi avasaron par meri sahaayta karne kii tatparta prakat kii or hamaari dosti unki mrityu tak jari rahi
 yah, mere dwaara padhi hui ek puraani kahawat kii sachai kaa ek or udhaaharan he, jo is prakaar he, "vah vyakti jisane aapkaa ek baar bhala kiya he vah duusari baar bhi aisa karne ke liye taiyaar rahegaa, bajaae uske jise aapane swayan anugrihith kiya ho 
" Franklin's conception is later known as the Ben Franklin Effect
 franklin ko kitaab udhaar dene ke baad uske pratidwandvi ko franklin ke prati apane manodrushti kii asangati ko suljhaana padaa, jisapar usne abhi-abhi ek upkaar bhi kiya he
 He justified his benevolence by telling himself that he really liked Franklin and consequently treated her with respect rather than treating her harshly since then
 dhumrapaan ko aksar sangyanatmak asangati ke ek udhaaharan ke rup main mana jaataa he kyonki yah vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki cigarette fefdon ke cancer kaa kaaran ban saktaa he, phir bhi lagbhag sabhi ek lambii or swasth jivan jeene kii chaah rakhte hai
 In terms of theory, the desire to live a long life is incompatible with any activity by which life is likely to be short
 in virodhabhasi vichaaron dwaara utpann tanaav ko dhumrapaan ko chhod kar, fefdon ke cancer ke saboot ko nakaar kar, yaa apane dhumrapaan kii aadat ko nyyochit tehra kar kam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, smokers may justify their behavior by saying that only a few smokers are ill, or that it is caused by excessive smokers, or if they do not die of smoking
 Will be from cheese While chemical addiction may work in addition to cognitive dissonance for existing smokers, newcomers who smoke may exhibit cognitive dissonance simple symptoms
 sangyanatmak asangati ke is maamle kii vyakhya sah-avadharana ke liye ek khatre ke sandarbh main kii ja sakati he
 The notion that "I am at increased risk of my lung cancer" is inconsistent with this "self-reliant belief that" i am a smart, rational person who always makes the right decisions
 " kyonki aksar bahaane bananaa vyavhaar badalane kii tulana main aasaan hota he, asangati ke siddhant is nishkarsh tak pahunchate hai ki manushya tarksangat hote hai lekin hameshaa tarksangat praani nahin hote
 Most research conducted on cognitive dissonance takes the form of four major criteria
 siddhant ke dwaara utpann mahatvapurn anusandhan sambhddha he jaankareeyon ke khulepan ke parinaamon ke saath, jo purv vishwaas ke saath asangat hai, kya hota he jab vyakti purv drushtikon ke saath asangat tareekon se kaary karne lagata he, kya hota he jab vyakti nirnay letaa he or prayaason ko vyay karne ke prabhaav ke saath
 Inconsistency occurs when people are confronted with information that is conflicting with their beliefs
 agar apni dharna ko badalane se asangati kam nahin hoti, tab yah asangati galat avadharana yaa jaankaree kii asweekruti yaa niraakaran ko parinamit karti he, un logon se samarthan lekar jo us vishwaas main bhagidaar hote hai or dusron ko saamanjasy sthapit karne ke liye raji karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 An early version of the theory of cognitive dissonance was published in Leon Festinger's 1956 book When Profiles Fells
 is pustak ne badhate hue vishwaas ke andar kaa vivaran diya jo kabhi-kabhi ek panth ke bhavishyavaanee kii vifaltaa kaa anukaran karata he
 All believers met at a pre-determined place and time, believing that only they alone would survive the destruction of the Earth
 The stipulated time came and passed without incident
 unhen ek teevr sangyanatmak asangati kaa saamana karnaa padaa: kya ve kisi dhokhe kaa shikaar hue hai? kya unhone vyarth main apni sansaarik sampatti daan kar di? adhikansh sadasyon ne kuch kam asangati par vishwaas karne ko chunaa: aliens ne prithvi ko ek doosraa mauka diya tha or yah samooh ab is sandesh kaa prasar karne ke liye shashakt kiye gaye: prithvi-dooshan rokna hoga
 is samooh ne bhavishyavaanee ke asafal hone ke baavjood bhi naatakeey rup se dharm parivartan ko badhaayaa
 In Festinger and Karlsmith's classic 1959 experiment, students were asked to spend an hour working hard and boring
 The work was designed with the aim of evoking a strong, negative attitude
 ek baar jab un bacchon ne yah kaary sampann kar liya, prayogkartaaon ne unamem se kuch bacchon se ek saral kaary karne kaa aagrah kiya
 He was asked to talk to another subject and to be convinced that his work was interesting and engaging
 kuch pratibhaagiyon ko is anugrah ke liye 20 dollar kaa bhugtan kiya gaya, ek anya samooh ko 1 dollar or ek niyantran samooh se is anugrah ko naa rane ko kaha gaya
 When they were asked to rate the boring task at the end of the study, the $ 20 group rated it more positively than the $ 20 group and the control groups
 ise fasetinjar or carlsmith dwaara sangyanatmak asangati ke liye sakshya ke rup main samajhaayaa gaya
 Researchers theorize that people experience dissonance between conflicting experiences, "I told someone the work was interesting" and "I actually found it boring
" " keval 1 dollar kaa bhugtan kiye jane par, chaatr apane rukh ko dabaae rakhaa jise vyakt karne ke liye unhen majaboor kiya gaya tha, kyonki unke paas doosraa koi auchity nahin tha
 However, the $ 20 group had a clear external justification for their behavior and thus faced less inconsistency
 baad ke prayogon main, asangati utpreran kii ek vaikalpik paddati aam ho gai
 In this research, researchers used contrasting essay-writing, in which people were paid different amounts to write essays in which they had to express opinions contrary to their own views
 jin logon ko sirf ek choti raashi kaa bhugtan kiya gaya unke paas apni annurupata ke liye kam auchity he or ve adhik asangati kaa anubhav karte hai
 One type of motivated-compliance paradigm is the forbidden toy paradigm
 1963 main carlsmith or aronson dwaara kiye gaye ek prayog ne bacchon main swa-auchity kaa parikshan kiya
 In this experiment, children were left in a room with a variety of toys, including a very desirable toy
 kamare se nikalne par, prayogkartaaon ne aadhe bacchon ko bataaya ki ek vishesh khilone se khilne par ek gambhir dand diya jayega or duusare aadhe se kaha ki ek maamuli sajaa di jaaegi
 adhyayan main sabhi bacchon ne us khalone ke saath khilne se parhez kiya
 Later, when the children were told that they could freely play with all the toys of their choice, the children in the group with the slightest punishment were less likely to play with that toy, even after being punished
 jin bacchon ko maamuli sazaa kii dhamkee di gai thi unhen khud ko yah samajhaana padaa ki kyon unhone khilone ke saath nahin khelaa
 The level of punishment was not so high in itself, so to reduce their inconsistency, those children had to convince themselves that the toy was not worth playing
 jaik breham dwaara yojit kiye gaye ek anya prakaar ke prayog main, 225 mahila chaatraon ne aam upkarnon kii ek shrinkhalaa kaa dar nirdhaarit kiya or phir unhen do main se koi ek upkaran kaa chunaav karne kii anumati di gai jise ve ek tofe ke rup main apane ghar le ja sakati thim
 In the second round of ratings, it is seen that participants have increased the rate of the devices they have chosen and reduced the rate of the items they have rejected
 ise sangyanatmak asangati ke rup main samajhaayaa ja saktaa he
 When a difficult decision has to be made, only the aspects of the rejected object are liked by themselves and these characteristics are incompatible with choosing something else
 duusare shabdon main, yah anubhuti, "main x ko chunaa", us anubhuti ke saath asangat he ki, "Y main aisi kuch chizein hai jo mujhe pasand he
 "recent research has found similar results in four-year-olds and capuchin monkeys
 asangati tab utpann hoti he jab kuch vaanchit lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye, vyakti swechhapurvak ek apriy gatividhi main sanlagn hota he
 The inconsistency can be reduced by exaggerating the desirability of the target
 aronson or mills kii thi vyaktiyon "se guzarana ek gambhir yaa halke diksha" karne ke liye samooh kaa sadsy banane ke ek
 gambhir-diksha haalat main, vyaktiyon ke ek sharmnaak gatividhiyon main lage hue hai
 The group turned out to be very dull and boring
 Individuals in the group assessed condition as more interesting than individuals in the severe-initiation condition
 upar maandand sabhi ke liye upyogi anusandhan main istemaal kiya ja jari he
 a situation of scrubbing has been shown to eliminate nasty reasons after decisional differences, perhaps because often disgusted by moral differences
 darryl kaarylay siddhant ke sangyanatmak asangati aalochak tha ek jaldi
 vah parinaam vivaran ke prayogtmak vaikalpik prastaav aatm adhik kifaayati ek dharna ke siddhant ke rup main
 aanshik samay ke anusaar, logon ko unke vyavhaar ke bare main zyada nahin lagata, chaahe ve akele sangharsh main hai
 The Office Festinger and Karlsmith interpreted people in the compliance paradigm induced as studying or inferring their attitudes from their behavior
 Thus, when asked, "did you find the work interesting?" They decided that they would find it interesting because of what they told someone
 The office suggested that people who had paid $ 20 were their incentives for a major behavior, external and likely found that they had actually found the work interesting to experience, rather than closing it as their money It is interesting for the reason
 sthitiyon main kai prayogtmak he, kaarylay siddhant or fasetinjar asangati ke siddhant bhavishyavaanee karne ke samaan he, lekin keval asangati ke siddhant araosl tanaav yaa apriy bhavishyavaanee kii maujuudagi kii
 prayogshaala prayogon sthitiyon arausal main matbhed kii upasthiti he satyapit
 is sangyanatmak asangati ke siddhant ke liye samarthan pradaan karata he or yah sambhaavna se hi aatm - dharna he ki sabhi prayogshaala nishkarshon ke liye khate main kar sakate hai banaata he
 In 1969, Elliott Aronson's concept itself reformulated it by adding the basic principle
 According to this new interpretation, cognitive dissonance does not arise because people experience differences between conflicting cognitions
 Rather, it is when people view their actions as conflicting with their own normally positive attitudes
 is prakaar, pratimaan ke bare main mul fasetinjar or anupaalan-carlsmith adhyayan kaa upyog prerit, aronson kaha ki matbhed anubhuti ke bich tha, "main ek anubhuti ek eemaandaar vyakti" or "main, dilachasp kaam khojane ke bare main jhooth bolaa tha kisi ko"
 anya manovaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki sthirataa banaae rakhane ke sangyanatmak avadharana he ek aatm chhavi, balki nijee aatm raksha ke liye jis tarah janata
 During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio argued that disharmony would be an invasive result, rather than anomaly
 According to this interpretation, the fact that lying is wrong and harmful, what is not the Cognitions discrepancy between makes people feel bad
 baad anusandhan, lekin paaya gaya ki logon ke anubhav matbhed bhi jab unhen lagata he ve kuch bhi galat nahin kiya he
 For example and his students Aronson has shown that people experience their own results of differences when statements are beneficial - as persuade when they use sexually active students using condoms, when they do not do it themselves Are condoms chen or sahakarmiyon ke pratimaan vikalp he aalochana mukt he or suzav diya ki, pasand, rank "vidhi kaa adhyayan besuraapan rank" avaidh he
 He argues that research design relies on the assumption that, if the subject rates in the second survey have different options, it is therefore the subject's attitude toward the changed options
 They point out that there may be other reasons found in a different ranking
 The second survey was probably largely indifferent between the choices
 haalanki, kuch anuvarthi anusandhan is khate virodhabhasi saboot pradaan kii he
 The neural network model of cognition has provided the necessary framework to integrate empirical research on cognitive dissonance and attitudes into a model of approach formation and interpretation of change
 vibhinn tantrika network model kaa vikaas yah bhavishyavaanee karne ke liye kiya gaya he ki kaise sangyanatmak asangati ek vyakti ke drushtikon or vyavhaar ko prabhavit karti he

 There was a lot of persecution on earth and heaven by them
 jiske falswaroop devataaon va manushyo ne devi durga ki aradhana kii or devi durga ne un sabhi ko vardaan diya ki vah avashya hi in donon daityo se unki raksha karengi

 vrikk yaa gurde kaa joda ek maanav ang hai, jinka pradhan kaary mutr utpaadan karnaa he
 The kidneys are found in many vertebrate animals
 ye mutr-pranali ke ang hai
 They regulate the electrolyte, alkali-acid balance and blood pressure
 inkaa mel swarup mutr kehalaata he
 It mainly consists of urea and ammonia
 gurde yugmit ang hote hai, jo kai kaary karte hai
 They are found in many types of animals, including vertebrates and some invertebrates
 ye hamaari mutr-pranali kaa ek aavashyak bhaag hai or ye electrolite niyantran, amla-kshar santulan, va raktchaap niyantran aadi jaise samasthiti kaary bhi karte he
 These act as natural purifiers of blood in the body and remove waste, which is then sent to the bladder
 mutr kaa utpaadan karte samay, gurde uria or ammonium jaise apshisht padaarth utsarjit karte hai; gurde jal, glucose or amino amlon ke punarvasoshana ke liye bhi zimmedaar hote hai
 The kidneys also produce hormones, including calcitriol, renin, and erythropoietin
 audrik guha ke pichley bhaag main retroperitonium The kidneys located in the vesicles receive blood from a pair of renal arteries and flow it into a pair of renal veins
 prayek gurda mutr ko ek mutrvahini main utsarjit karata he, jo ki swayan bhi mutrashay main rikt hone vaali ek yugmit sanrachana hoti he
 The study of kidney function is called renal physiology, while the medical method related to kidney diseases is called Meghalogy
 gurde kii bimaariyaan vividh prakaar kii hai, lekin gurde se judi bimariyon ke rogiyon main aksar vishisht chikitsiya lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 Common medical conditions associated with the kidney include nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute renal lesions, chronic kidney diseases, urethral infections, renal calculi and ureteric obstruction
 gurde ke cancer ke anek prakaar bhi maujuud hai; sabase aam vayask vrikk cancer vrikk koshika karkat he
 Cancer, cyst and some other kidney conditions can be managed by removal of the kidney, or by renal dissection
 jab gurde kaa kaary, jise kechikagucchheey shuddhikaran dar ke dwaara napa jaataa he, lagaataar buree ho, to dyalisis or gurde kaa pratyaropan iske upachaar ke vikalp ho sakate hai
 Although stones are not very harmful, they can also cause pain and problems
 pathari ko hataane kii prakriya main dhwani tarangon dwaara upachaar shaamil he, jisase pathar ko chote tukdon main todakar mutrashay ke raste baahar nikaal diya jaataa he
 Intense pain in the medial / lateral segments of the back of the back is a common symptom of appendicitis
 manushyon main, gurde udar guha main retroperitonium naamak rikt sthaan main sthit hote hai
 Their number is two and one of these kidneys is located one on either side of the spinal cord; They are approximately at the vertebral level from T12 to L3
 daayan gurda madhyapat ke thik neeche or yakrut ke peeche sthit hota he, tathaa baayan madhyapat ke neeche or pleeha ke peeche hota he
 There is an adrenal gland at the top of each kidney
 yakrut ke kaaran udar guha main pai jane vaali vishmata ke kaaran daayan gurda baayen kii tulana main thodaa neeche hota he or baayan gurda daaen kii tulana main thodaa adhik madhyam main sthit hota he
 The upper part of the kidney is partially protected by the eleventh and twelfth ribs and the entire kidney and adrenal glands are covered by fat and renal bandage
 prayek vayask gurde kaa bhaar purushon main 125 se 170 gram ke bich or mahilaon main 115 se 155 gram ke bich hota he
 Typically, the left kidney is slightly larger than the right
 gurde kii sanrachana saim ke aakaar kii hoti he, prayek gurde main avatal or uttal satahen pai jaati hai
 The concave surface, called the renal nucleus, is the point from which the renal artery enters this organ and the renal vein and ureter exit
 gurda sakht reshedaar utakon, vrikkeey capsule se ghira hota he, jo swayan perinephric vasa, vrikk pattee tathaa paranefric vasa se ghiri hoti he
 The anterior border of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior border is the transversalis bandage
 daaen gurde kii upree seemaa yakruy se satee hui hoti he; or baayin seemaa pleeha se judi hoti he
 Therefore, both of these go down when breathing
 gurda lagbhag 11-14 semi lanbaa, 6 semi chaudaa or 3 semi motaa hota he
 The substance of the kidney, or organism, is divided into two main structures: the renal bark in the upper part and the renal medulla within it
 kul milakar ye sanrachanaayen shanku ke aakaar ke aath se atharah vrikkeey khandon kii ek akruti banaati hai, jinamein se prayek main majja ke ek bhaag ko dhankane vaali vrikk chaal hoti he, jise vrikkeey pyramid kaha jaataa he
 Between the renal pyramids are bark ridges, called renal columns
 nefron, gurde kii mutr utpann karne vaali kaaryaatmak sanrachanaayen, chaal se lekar majja tak faili hoti hai
 The initial purification part of a nephron is the renal corpuscle located in the bark, followed by a renal tubule known deep into the medullary pyramids through the bark
 ek majjatmak kiran, vrikkeey chaal kaa ek bhaag, vrikkeey nalikaaon kaa ek samooh hota he, jo ek ekal sangrahan nalika main jaakar rikt hoti hai
 The end of each pyramid, or sprout, carries urine into the miniature follicle, the miniature follicle empties into the main follicles, and the main follicle empties into the renal pelvis, which becomes the urinaloid
 gurde baayin tathaa dahini vrikk dhamniyon se rakt praapt karte hai, jo sidhe audrik mahadhamani se nikalati hai
 Despite their relatively small size the kidneys receive about 20% of the blood released from the heart
 prayek vrikkeey dhamni anek khandaatmak dhamniyon main vibhajit ho jaati he, jo aage antarkhandtmak dhamniyon main bant jaati hai, jo vrikkeey capsule kaa chhedan karti hai or vrikkeey pyramidon ke bich sthit vrikkeey stambhon se hokar guzarati hai
 Subcutaneous arteries then supply blood to the arterial arteries, which are at the border of the bark and medulla
 prayek chapakar dhamni vibhinn antarkhandtmak dhamniyaan pradaan karti he, jo abhivahi dhamniyon ko bharti hai, jo glomeruli ko rakt kii aapurti karti hai
 Interstitum) is the functional space in the kidney, which is located under single fibers, which are filled with blood vessels
 interstitom mutr se punarprapt hue drav ko avashoshit kar letaa he
 Many conditions can cause scarring or blood clotting in this area, which can result in obstruction of kidney function and may even stop functioning
 shodhan kii prakriya purna ho jane par rakt shirikaon ke ek chote network se hokar guzarataa he, jo antarkhandtmak shiraaon kii ore abhisaran karti hai
 The veins also follow the same arterial distribution pattern, the afferent veins deliver blood to the umbilical veins, and from there it leads to the interdigital veins, which form the renal veins that exit the kidney for blood transfusions
 vrikkeey utak-vigyaan main gurde kii ek sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dikhaai dene vaali sanrachana kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Several distinct cell-types are found in the kidney, including the following: gurda or snaayu tantra vrikkeey jaal ke madhyam se aapas main samvaad karte hai, jiske reshe gurde tak pahunchane ke liye vrikkeey dhamniyon ke saath jude hote hai
 Input from the sympathetic nervous system induces vasoconstrictors in the kidney, causing renal blood flow to decrease
 aisa mana jaataa he ki gurde sahanukampi snaayu tantra se input praapt nahin karte
 gurde se nikalne vaale samvedak input merudand ke T10-11 staron kii ore badhata he or sambandhit antartvacha dwaara mahasoos kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the pain felt in the armpits may be related to the kidneys
 amla-kshar santulan, electrolite sandrata, koshiketar drav maatra ko niyantrit karke or raktchaap par niyantran rakhte hue gurde puure sharir ke homeostasis main bhaag lete hai
 The kidneys perform these homeostatic functions both independently and in association with other organs, particularly the organs of the endocrine system
 in antahsravi kaaryon kii purti ke liye vibhinn antahsravi hormone ke bich talmail kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jinamein renin, angiotensis II, eldosterone, antidiauratic hormone or artial natriuratic peptid aadi shaamil hai
 Many of the functions of the kidney are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of refining, reabsorption and secretion that occur in the nephron
 parishodhan, jo ki vrikkeey kanika main hota he, ek prakriya he jiske dwaara koshikaayen tathaa bade protein rakt se chaane jate hai or ek ultraphiltret kaa nirmaan hota he, jo antat mutr banegaa
 gurde ek din main 180 litre ultraphiltret utpann karte hai, jiskaa ek bahut bada pratishat punarvashoshit kar liya jaataa he or mutr kii lagbhag 2 litre maatra kii utpann hoti he
 The transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate into the blood is called reabsorption
 srav isaki vipareet prakriya he, jisamen anu vipareet disha main, rakt se mutr kii ore bheje jate hai
 Car waste materials emit
 inamen protein apachay se utpann nitrogen-yukt apshisht uria or neucleic amla ke chayapachay se utpann urik amla shaamil hai
 Any significant increase or fall in plasma osmolarity is identified by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior mucous gland
 parasaraniyata main vruddhi hone par yah granthi antidiauratic hormone adiech kaa srav karti he, jiske parinamswaroop gurde dwaara jal kaa punarvasoshana kiya jaataa he or mutr kii sandrata bad jaati he
 These two factors work together to bring plasma osmolality back to normal levels
 adiech sangrahan nalika main sthit mukhya koshikaon se judaa hota he, jo equaporin ko majja main sthanantarit karata he, taaki jal saamanytah abhedya majja ko chhod sake or vaasa riekta dwaara sharir main iskaa punarvasoshana kiya ja sake, jisase sharir main plasma kii maatra main vruddhi hoti he
 There are two systems that create hyperpolar marrow and thus increase the amount of plasma in the body: urea recycling and 'single effect'
 uria saamanytah gurdon se ek apshisht padaarth ke rup main utsarjit kiya jaataa he
 However, when plasma blood volume is low and ADH is released, exposed aquaporins are also susceptible to urea
 isse uria ko ek hyper sangrahan nalika ko chhodkar majja main pravesh karke jal ko ‘aakarshith’ karne vaale ek hyperosmctic vilyan kaa nirmaan karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Urea can then re-enter the nephron and be re-excreted or recycled depending on whether ADH is still present
 ‘ekal prabhaav’ is tathy kaa varnan karata he ki lups of henley kaa motaa arohi ang jal ke dwaara bhedya nahin he, lekin bhu
ni ke dwaara bhedya he
 This means that a counter-flow system is created, through which the medulla becomes more concentrated and if the collecting duct is opened by the ADH, it must be followed by a osmolarity ratio of water
 lambii-avadhi main raktchaap kaa niyantran mukhyatah gurde par nirbhar hota he
 This is mainly through the maintenance of extracellular fluid subdivision, whose size depends on the plasma sodium concentration
 haalanki, gurde sidhe hi raktchaap kaa anumaan nahin laga sakate, lekin nefron ke duurastha bhaagon main sodium or chloride kii supurdagee main parivartan gurde dwaara kiye jane vaale kinvak renin ke srav ko parivartit kar detaa he
 When the extracellular fluid subdivision is expanded and blood pressure is high, the delivery of these ions increases and the secretion of renin decreases
 isi prakaar, jab koshiketar drav upkhand sankuchit ho or raktchaap nimna ho, to sodium or chloride kii supurdagee kam ho jaati he or pratikriyaswaroop renin srav bad jaataa he
 Renin is the first member of a series of chemical messengers that together form the renin – angiotensin mechanism
 renin main hone vaale parivartan antat is tantra ke output, mukhya rup se angiotencin II or eldosteron, ko parivartit karte hai
 Each hormone acts through multiple mechanisms, but both increase the absorption of sodium chloride by the kidneys, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid subdivision and raising blood pressure
 jab renin ke str bade hue hote hai, to angiotencin II or eldosteron kii sandrata bad jaati he, jiske parinamswaroop sodium chloride ke punarvasoshana main vruddhi hoti he, koshiketar drav upkhand kaa vistaar hota he or raktchaap bad jaataa he
 Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, causing contraction of the extracellular fluid subdivision and decreasing blood pressure
 gurde anek prakaar ke hormone kaa srav karte hai, jinamein arethropitin, calcetriol or renin shaamil hai
 Erythropoietin is released as a response to hypoxia in the renal flow
 yah asthi-majja main arethropoasis ko utprerit karata he
 Calcitriol, the catalytic form of vitamin D, encourages intestinal absorption of calcium and renal reabsorption of phosphate
 renin, jo ki renin-angiotencin-eldosteron tantra kaa ek bhaag he, eldosteron staron ke niyantran main shaamil ek enzim hota he
 In mammals, the kidney develops from the intermediate mesoderm
 gurde kaa vikaas, jise nefrogenesis bhi kaha jaataa he, teen kramik charnon se hokar guzarataa he, jinamein se prayek ko gurde ke ek adhik unnat jode ke vikaas dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he: pronfros, mesonefros or metanefros 
 The kidneys of various animals show evidence of developmental adaptation and have long been studied in ecology and comparative physiology
 gurde kaa akruti vigyaan, jise aksar majjatmak motaai ke rup main soochibaddh kiya jaataa he, stanpayi jeevon kii prajatiyon main prakritik awaas ke sookhepan se sambandhit hota he
 Medical glossaries associated with the kidney usually use words such as renal and nephro-prefixes
 visheshan vrikkeey, jiskaa arth hota he, vrikk se sambandhit, latin shabd reness se liya gaya he, jiskaa arth he gurde; upsarg nefro- gurde ke liye prayukt pracheen greek shabd nefros ) se liya gaya he
 For example, removal of the kidney by surgery is called nephrectomy, whereas renal dysfunction is called renal dysfunction
 saamanytah, manushya keval ek gurde ke saath bhi saamaanya rup se jivit rah sakate hai kyonki prayek main vrikkeey utakon kii sankhya jivit rahane ke liye aavashyak sankhya se adhik hoti he
 Long-term kidney diseases will develop only when the amount of functional kidney tissue decreases too much
 Renal replacement treatment, in the form of dialysis or renal transplantation, is required when the glomerular purification rate is greatly reduced or when the symptoms of renal dysfunction are very severe
 adhikansh kasheruki jeevon main, mesonefros ek vayask gurde main parivartit ho jaataa he, haalanki aksar yah adhik unnat metanefros ke saath judaa hua hota he; keval amniot main mesonefros bhrun tak simit hota he
 The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, long limbs that surround a large part of the torso
 nefron ke prayek jhund kii sangrahan nalikaayen ek archinephric nalika main jaakar rikt hoti he, jo ki amniot jeevon ke vaas defrence sadrush he
 However, this situation is not always simple; In cartilage fishes and in some amphibians, there is a small tube similar to the ureter found in amniote organisms, which empties the posterior parts of the kidney and joins the archinephric duct on the bladder or sluice
 vastutah, anek vayask upasthissom machhliyon main, gurde kaa agr bhaag vikrut ho saktaa he yaa puri tarah kaary karnaa band kar saktaa he
 In most primitive vertebrate organisms, hagfish and lampreys, the kidney structure is exceptionally simple: it consists of a line of nephrons, each of which is directly vacillated in the archinephric duct
 aksheruki jeevon main aise utsarjan ang ho sakate hai, jinka ullekh kabhi-kabhi “gurdon” ke rup main kiya jaataa he, lekin, yahaan tak ki emphioxs main bhi, ye kabhi bhi kasheruki jeevon ke gurdon ke sadrush nahin hote or zyada sahi rup se unke liye anya naamon, jaise nefredia kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The kidneys of reptiles are made up of several segments, which are roughly arranged in a linear pattern
 prayek khand ke centre main mutrvahini kii ek ekal shakha hoti he, jisamen sangrahan vahini aakar rikt hoti he
 Reptiles have relatively fewer nephrons than other amniote organisms of the same size, presumably because they have lower metabolic rates
 pakshiyon main apekshaakrit bade, lambey gurde hote hai, jinamein se prayek teen yaa adhik pruthak khandon main vibhajit hota he
 These segments are composed of several small, irregularly arranged segments, each of which is centered on a branch of the ureter
 pakshiyon ke glomeruli kaa aakaar chota hota he, lekin unamem nefron kii sankhya stanpayi jeevon kii tulana main lagbhag doguni hoti he
 The human kidney is a very specific example of mammal organisms
 anya kasheruki jeevon kii tulana main stanpayi gurde ke vishisht lakshanon main, vrikkeey pedu or vrikkeey pyramid kii upasthiti or ek spasht rup se pahachaane ja sakane vaali chaal or majja kii upasthiti shaamil hai
 The latter symptom is due to the presence of a large size of the loops of Henle; They are much smaller in birds and are not found in other vertebrates
 Only in mammal organisms, the kidney is in its traditional "kidney" shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multi-tubular reniculate kidneys of members of the Timberg
 latin shabd reness angrezi bhashaa ke shabd “reens ” se sambandhit he, jo ki shakespeare kaal kii angrezi, jo vah kaal bhi he, jisamen king james varjan kaa anuwaad hua tha, kii angrezi ) main gurde kaa samanaarthi shabd he
 Once upon a time, the kidneys were considered a popular place of conscience and contemplation, and many lines of the Bible are 7: 9, Rev
 2:23) says that God searches for and inspects the kidneys or "kidney" of humans
 isi prakaar, tolmud kahata he ki do main se ek gurda is baat kii salaah detaa he ki kya acha he or doosraa bataata he ki kya bura he
 The kidneys of animals can be cooked and eaten by humans
 gurdon ko saamanytah bhunaa yaa tala jaataa he, lekin bahut jatil khaadya-padaarthon main unhen ek saalan, jo inke swaad ko badhayega, ke saath dhimi aanch par pakaaya jaataa he
 In many substances, such as a mixed grill or Murav Yerushalmi, the kidneys are mixed with pieces of meat or liver
 gurde se banane vaale sarvaadhik pratishthit khaadya-padaarthon main, british stick or kidney pai, swedish hocarpana, french rognos di viyu sos motrarde or spanish “rinons al jerez ”, vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
