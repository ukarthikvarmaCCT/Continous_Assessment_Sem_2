 The interlude of Vivekananda's life was that he was convinced that if there is any country in the lap of the earth that has made sincere efforts for every kind of betterment of man, it is India
 unhone purohitwaad, brahmanwad, dharmik karmkand or roodhiyon kii khilli bhi udaayi or lagbhag akramanakari bhashaa main aisi visangatiyon ke khilaaf yuddh bhi kiya
 According to him, the squeeze of the ideas of the best thinkers of Hinduism is still a matter of envy for the whole world

 Swami Vivekananda Macaulay was opposed to the English education system prevalent at that time, because the purpose of this education was only to increase the number of babus
 vah aisi shiksha chaahate the jisase balak kaa sarvangin vikaas ho sake
 The aim of a child's education is to make him self-sufficient and stand on his feet
 swami vivekananda ne prachlit shiksha ko 'nishedhaatmak shiksha' kii sangya dete hue kaha he ki aap us vyakti ko shikshit maanate hai jisane kuch parikshaayen uteern kar lee hon tathaa jo achche bhaashan de saktaa ho, par vaastaviktaa yah he ki jo shiksha jansadharan ko jivan sangharsh ke liye taiyaar nahin karti, jo charitra nirmaan nahin karti, jo samaaj seva kii bhaavana viksit nahin karti tathaa jo sher jaisaa saahas paidaa nahin kar sakati, aisi shiksha se kya laabh? Therefore, Swamiji was not in favor of theoretical education, he considered practical education useful to the person
 vyakti kii shiksha hi use bhavishya ke liye taiyaar karti he, isliye shiksha main un tatwon kaa hona aavashyak he, jo uske bhavishya ke liye mahatvapurn ho
 In the words of Swami Vivekananda, swami ji shiksha dwaara loukik evam parloukik donon jivan ke liye taiyaar karnaa chaahate hai
 In relation to education from a secular point of view, he has said that 'we need such education, which constitutes character, increases the strength of the mind, develops the intellect and makes the person self-reliant
 ' parloukik drushti se unhone kaha he ki 'shiksha manushya kii anternihit purnataa kii abhivyakti he
 ' swami vivekananda ke shiksha darshan ke aadharbhoot siddhanth nimnlikhit hai – 1
 Education should be such that the physical, mental and spiritual development of the child can be done

 Traditionally, twelve subspecies of lions have recently been identified, of which the largest is Barbary lion
 in up prajatiyon ko vibhedit karne vaale mukhya antar he sthiti, ayaal kii upasthiti, aakaar or vitaran
 Because these traits are very insignificant and reflect high individual resolution, most of these forms are debatable and possibly invalid; In addition, they often rely on zooids of unknown origin with "salient but unusual" morphological features

 Lions are known to breed with tigers leading to the creation of hybrids known as ligers or tigons
 unhone tendue ke saath prajnan ke dwaara leopon, or jaguaar ke saath prajnan ke dwaara jegalyan bhi banaaye hai
 Maroji is a spotted lion or a natural leopon, while the Congolese spotted lion is a complex lion-jaguar-leopard hybrid called lizagulep
 aise sankar saamanytah kisi samay par chidyaghar main prajnan karwaae jate the, lekin ab jatiyon or up prajatiyon ke sangrakshan par jor die jane ke kaaran yah prakriya hatosahit ho gayi he
 Hybrids are still bred in zoos and private animal bird collections in China

 They acquire the physical and practical properties of both male and female parent species
 Male ligers are impotent, but female ligers are often reproducible

 However, due to the variation of skull in the two species, generally only the lower jaw structure can be used as a reliable indicator of species
 singh ke rangon main bhi bahut bhinnata milti he, yah baf se lekar, pilaa, laal, yaa gaharaa bhura ho saktaa he
 The lower parts are generally light colored and the tail bunch is black
 singh ke shaavak apane sharir par bhure dhabbon ke saath paidaa hote hai, yah tendue se miltaa julata lakshan he
 Although as lions begin to become adult, these spots fade, discolored spots can be seen, especially in the female, later on the lower parts and legs
 singh billi parivaar kaa ek maatr sadsy he jo spasht langik dvirupata pradarshit karata he- arthath, nar or maadaa vibhedit rup se alag dikhaai dete hai
 For example, the lioness, which plays the role of a hunter, lacks a thick cumbersome mane like a male

 This symptom hinders a male's ability to hide himself during hunting and generates a lot of heat while running

 The body weight of an adult lion is generally 150–250 kg for a male and 120–182 kg for a female
 novel or jackson report ke anusaar nar kaa vajan 181 kilogram or maadaa kaa vajan 126 kilogram hota he; mount kenya ke paas ek nar kaa vajan 272 kilogram paaya gaya

 The captive lions are of a larger size than the wild lions — the heaviest lion ever recorded in the record is a Simba salt a male lion, weighing 375 kg, kept at the Colchester Zoo in England in 1970
 sabase vishisht visheshta jo nar or maadaa donon main pai jaati he vah yah he, ki donon main poonch ek baalo ke guchchhe main samaapt hoti he, is guchchhe main ek kathor "spine " yaa "spor" hota he jo lagbhag 5 millimetre lambaa hota he, jo aapas main sangalit ho gayi puchh asthi ke antim bhaag se banataa he
 The lion is the only felid in which a tufted tail is found — the functions of this spine and bunch are unknown
 janm ke samay anupasthit yah guchha lagbhag 51⁄2 maah kii aayu main viksit hota he or 7 maah kii aayu par aasaani se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 The mane of an adult male lion is unique among cats, being the most distinguishing characteristic of this species
 yah singh ko bada dikhaata he, ek shandaar rup detaa he; yah anya singhon or prajati ke mukhya pratispardhi, africa ke spoted hyena, ke saath mukaable ke dauraan singh kii madad karata he, ayaal kii upasthiti, anupasthiti, rang or aakaar, anuvanshik saranchana, langik paripakvata, jalwaayu or testosterone ke nirmaan se sambandhit hota he; thamb rul ke anusaar ayaal jitani gahari or ghani hoti he, singh utana hi swasth hota he
 The lioness gives preference to the male whose mane is more dense and deep when choosing his sexual partner
 tanzania main anusandhan bhi bataata he ki nar-nar sambandh main ayaal kii lambaai ladai main safalataa ke signal detii he
 Deep-manicured animals have a high reproductive age and increase the chances of survival of their offspring, although they suffer a lot during the hottest months of the year
 do yaa teen naron se yukt ek samooh main aisi sambhaavna hoti he ki maadaa us nar ke saath sakriyata se sambhog karnaa chaahati he jisaki ayaal adhik ghani hoti he
 Scientists once said that the specific status of some subspecies can be understood by morphology, including mane size
 aakaariki kaa upyog up prajatiyon kii pahchaan ke liye kiya jaataa he jaise barbari singh or kep singh
 haalanki anusandhan bataate hai ki paryaavarniya kaarak jaise parivesh kaa taapmaana ayaal ke aakaar or rang ko prabhavit karte hai
 Zoos in European and North America are more densely manic due to cold ambient temperatures
 is prakaar se ayaal up prajati kii pahchaan kaa upyukt markar nahin he
 Although males of the Asian subspecies are reflected by the rare mane compared to the average African lion, the maneless male lion has been found in Senegal and Savo East National Parks in Kenya, and Timbawati's original white male lion was also maneless
 kastrated singh kii ayaal nunatam hoti he
 Sometimes there is an absence of a mane in the population of interbreed lions; This inbreeding also causes a decrease in fertility
 kai singhniyon main ek raf hoti he jo vishesh sthitiyon main spasht ho sakati he
 It is sometimes indicated in sculptures, paintings, especially ancient artwork and is mistaken for a man's mane
 yah ek ayaal se alag hoti he, haalanki yah jabade kii rekha par kaan ke neeche pai jaati he, iske bal kii lambaai kam hoti he or is par jaldi se dhyaan nahin jaataa he, jabaki ek ayaal nar ke kaanon ke upar tak faili hoti he, aksar unki bahari rekha ko puri tarah se dhak detii he
 The extinct European cave lion cave paintings depict animals without mane, or only a hint of mane, indicating that they were more or less mane; However, females hunting for a group have been the main subject of the paintings — since they are depicted in a hunting-related group — so these pictures are not sufficient to decide that males were mannered
 chitra bataate hai ki vilupt prajatiya samakaleen singhon kii tarah samaan saamaajik sanghathan or shikaar kii ranneetiyon kaa prayog karti thim
 The white lion is not a distinct subspecies, but a genetic condition, a distinctive form of leukism, that causes yellowishness in color that gives a white tiger-like color; This condition is similar to militarization, which is the cause of black panthers
 ve albinos nahin hote hai, unki aankhon or twachaa main saamaanya abhiranjan hota he, safed transwaal singh kabhi kabhi purvi dakshini africa main kruger rashtriya udyaan or paas hi ke timbavathi nijee khel rigerv main saamne aaye, lekin saamanyatya unhen kaid main rakhaa jaataa he, jahaan prajnak soch samaj kar unka chayan karte hai
 An unusual cream-colored covering on their body is caused by an ineffective gene

 Sighting was first reported in the early 1900s and continued to occur randomly for nearly 50 years, when in 1975 the waste of the white lion cub was found in the Timbavati Game Reserve
 singh apana adhikansh samay aaraam karte hue bitaate hai or ek din main lagbhag 20 ghanton ke liye niskriy rahete hai, yadhyapi singh kisi bhi samay sakriy ho sakate hai, aam taur par unki gatividhiyaan sanjh ke baad tivratam ho jaati hai jab ve ikatthe hote hai, samooh banaate hai or mel tyaag karte hai
 Sudden intermittent activities occur during the night until dawn when hunted frequently
 ve ausatan ek din main do ghante chalane main or 50 minute khaane main vyay karte hai
 Lion hunters are carnivores that express two types of social organization
 kuch nivasee hote hai jo pride naamak samooh main rahete hai
 The pride usually consists of about five or six related females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males that form a relationship with an adult female
 Males associated with a pride usually have up to two, but may also increase to four and decrease again over time
 nar shaavak paripakv ho jane par apni maa ke pride ko chhod dete hai
 The second organizational behavior is called nomads, which are widely spread over a range and move around randomly, they may live alone or in pairs, pairs of related males are more commonly seen that differ from their original pride
 Have become
 dhyaan den ki ek singh apni jivan style ko badal saktaa he; khanaabadosh nivasee ban sakate hai or iskaa vipareet bhi sambhav he
 Males have to go through this lifestyle and some are never able to join any pride
 If a female becomes nomadic, it is more difficult for her to join a new pride, because females in a pride are related and reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their group

 No reliable reports were later found from Iran
 Now this subspecies is found only in and around the Gir forests of northwest India

 Currently, the population range of African lions is estimated to be between 16,500 and 47,000 in the forests in 2002–2004, down from the 1990 estimate of 100,000, which may have been 400,000 in 1950
 The reason for this decline is not understood properly and may not be reversible

 Establishing a second population is important because it will act as a gene pool for the last surviving Asiatic lion and will help in the development and maintenance of genetic variation to maintain species survival
 The former popularity of Barbary lion as a zoo animal means that the lions scattered in captivity are descendants of Barbary lion stock

 The African lion scheme began in 1993, focusing specifically on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in estimating the genetic variation of lions in captivity, since most members are of unknown origin, maintaining genetic variation
 Let's make it a problem

 at: iskaa naam bharat natyam hua
 Bharata Natyam skillfully incorporates the three basic elements of dance
 ye hai bhav athwa man:sthiti, raag athwa sangeet or swarmardhuy or taal athwa kaal samanjan
 In the technique of Bharata Natyam, there are 64 principles of coordination of hands, feet, mouth, and body movements, which are performed with the dance curriculum

 isamen adhikanshat: purush hi mahilaon kii bhoomika nibhaate hai, jabaki ab kuch samay se mahilaon ko kathakali main shaamil kiya jaataa he
 The present-day Kathakali is a dance drama tradition developed centuries ago with the tradition of Kerala's highly specialized style of drama, particularly Kudiyattam
 parmparik reeti rivaaj jaise theyam, mudiattem or kerala kii marshall kalaayen nrity ko vartmaan swaroop main laane ke liye mahatvpurn bhoomika nibhaati hai
 The dance form of Kathak is recognized by the rhythmic footsteps, the Vihangam Chakkar, with more than 100 ghungars tied to the feet, and a dramatic rendition of themes from Persian and Urdu poetry, in addition to Hindu religious stories
 kathak kaa janm uttar main hua kintu persian or muslim prabhaav se yah mandir kii reeti se darbari manoranjan tak pahunch gaya
 The style of Kathak originated in the traditional re-enumeration of the Hindus by Brahmin priests, who were called Kathikas, who used haw expressions in a dramatic way
 kramash: isamen katha kehane kii style or adhik viksit hui tathaa ek nrity rup ban gaya
 After the arrival of the Mughals in North India, the dance was taken to the royal court and developed into a sophisticated kalarupa, patronized by the Mughal rulers, and Kathak took its present form
 is nrity main ab dharm kii apeksha saundarya bodh par adhik bal diya gaya
 The term Kathak originates from Katha, which literally means storytelling
 puraane samay main katha vaachak gaanon ke rup main ise bolte or apni katha ko ek nayaa rup dene ke liye nrity karte
 This led to the form of Katha Kalakshapam and Hari Katha in South India and this is known as Kathak in North India

 Odissi is considered to be one of the oldest surviving dance forms based on archaeological evidence
 orissa ke parmparik nrity, odisi kaa janm mandir main nrity karne vaali devdasiyon ke nrity se hua tha
 The Odissi dance is mentioned in the rock inscriptions, it is depicted in the inscriptions of the Brahmeshwar temple as well as in the central chamber of the Sun Temple of Konark
 varsh 1950 main is puure nrity rup ko ek nayaa rup diya gaya, jiske liye abhinay chandrika or mandiron main paae gaye taraashe hue nrity kii mudraaen dhanyavad ke paatr hai
 Odissi has two major aspects, similar to any other Indian classical dance form: dance or non-representational dance, where decorative patterns are created using body movements in space and time
 iskaa ek anya rup abhinay he, jise sankethik haath ke haav bhav or chehre kii abhivyaktiyon ko kahani yaa vishaywastu samajhane main upyog kiya jaataa he
 It focuses on the trinity, which means dividing the body into three parts, the head, body and feet; The postures and expressions are similar to those of Bharata Natyam

 It is a soft, poetic Shastri dance that praises the surroundings of Orissa and the glory of its most popular deity, Lord Jagannath

 Manipuri dance is different from other dance forms in India
 isamen sharir dhimi gati se chalata he, sankethik bhavyata or manamohak gati se bhujaayen anguliyon tak pravaahit hoti hai
 This dance form evolved in the 18th century with the Vaishnava sect, which consists of its earliest customs and magical dance forms
 vishnu puraana, bhagwat puraana tathaa gitgovind kii rachanaaon se ai vishaywastuen isamen pramukh rup se upyog kii jaati hai
 According to the legend of the Metai tribe of Manipur, when God created the earth, it was like a body
 saat lenooraah ne is nav nirmit golardh par nrity kiya, apane pairon se ise majboot or chikna banane ke liye ise komalta se dabaaya
 This is the origin of Metai Jagoi
 aaj ke samay tak jab manipuri log nrity karte hai ve kadam teji se nahin rakhte balki apane pairon ko bhoomi par komalta or mriduta ke saath rakhte hai
 The original misconceptions and stories are still narrated by the Metai priests or Mibis as Mibis which are the root of Manipuri
 mahila "raas" nrity radha-krishna kii vishaywastu par aadhaarit he jo bele tathaa ekal nrity kaa rup he
 The male "sankirtana" dance is performed with full force to the beat of the Manipuri Dholak
 mohiniattam kerala kii mahilaon dwaara kiya jane vaala ardh shastreey nrity he jo kathakali se adhik purana mana jaataa he
 Literally known among the dances, the magical Mohiniattam was prominently performed in Kerala temples
 yah devdasi nrity viraasat kaa uttaradhikari bhi mana jaataa he jaise ki bharat natyam, kuchipudi or odisi
 This word Mohini means a woman who captivates the desire of the beholder or instills a desire in them
 yah bhagwaan vishnu kii ek jaani maani kahani he ki jab unhone dugdh sagar ke manthan ke dauraan logon ko aakarshith karne ke liye mohini kaa rup dhaaran kiya tha or bhamasur ke vinaash kii kahani iske saath judi hui he
 Hence, it is thought that Vaishnava devotees gave the name of Mohiniattam to this dance form
 mohiniatatm kaa pratham sandarbh majamangalam narayan nabboodiri dwaara sankalpit vyavhaar maala main paaya jaataa he jo 16veen shatabdi e di main rachaa gaya
 In the 19th century, Swati Tirunal was the king of the erstwhile Travan corps, who made considerable efforts to promote and stabilize this art form

 Siddhendra Yogi, a perfect man in the era of the decline of dance due to exploitation of female dancers, redefined the dance
 kuchipudi ke pandrah brahman pariwaron ne paanch shatabdiyon se adhik samay tak parampara ko aage badhaayaa he
 Eminent gurus like Vedantham Lakshmi Narayan, Chinta Krishna Murthy and Tadepalli Peraya have enriched the dance by including women in it

 But when Ishwar Singh announced to be the ruler of Jaipur before his intentions were completed, the enraged Madhosingh, together with his maternal uncle, Maharana of Udaipur and the kings of Bunda and Bundi, attacked Jaipur in 1744

 Maharaja Surajmal also reached Jaipur with the help of Ishwari Singh with ten thousand soldiers and in August 1748, Jaipur was again conquered in the battle under the leadership of General Hargovind Natani at Bagru, 20 miles from Jaipur
 " Ishwari Singh had great faith in his other minister Keshavdas Khatri, but he did not like Hargovind Natani with a teary eye
