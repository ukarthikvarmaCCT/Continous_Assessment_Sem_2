 The restoration of this temple started in 1755 and was completed in 1786 after a long time of 31 years
 kaha jaataa he ki is bhavy mandir ke nirmaan main kareeb 16 lakh rupye kharch kiye gaye the, jo us samay kaaphi badi rakam maani jaati thi
 After walking some distance inside the village, the main gate of the temple starts to appear

 After entering the sanctum sanctorum inside the temple, only the Argha of the Shivalinga is visible, not the linga
 gaur se dekhne par argha ke andar ek-ek inch ke teen ling dikhaai dete hai
 These lingas are considered to be the incarnation of Trideva- brahma-vishnu and Mahesh
 bhor ke samay hone vaali puja ke baad is argha par chaandi kaa panchmukhi mukut chadha diya jaataa he
 The Trimbakeshwar temple and village is located in the foothills of a hill called Brahmagiri
 is giri ko shiv kaa saakshaat rup mana jaataa he
 It is on this mountain that the holy Godavari river originates
 kaha jaataa he- In ancient times, Trimbak was the taphobhoomi of Gautama Rishi
 apane upar lage gohatya ke paap se mukti paane ke liye gautam rishi ne kathor tap kar shiv se ganga ko yahan avatarit karne kaa vardaan maanga
 As a result, the Ganges, the Godavari River, originated in the south
 godavari ke udgam ke saath hi gautam rishi ke anunay-vinay ke uparaant shivaji ne is mandir main virajman hona sweekaar kar liya
 This place came to be called Trimbak due to the three-eyed Shivshambhu sitting here
 ujjain or omkareshwar kii hi tarah tryambakeshwar maharaj ko is gaanv kaa raja mana jaataa he, isliye har somvaar ko tryambakeshwar ke raja apni praja kaa haal jaanane ke liye nagar bhraman ke liye nikalate hai
 This story is described in Shivpuran about the establishment of this Jyotirlinga
 ek baar maharishi gautam ke tapovana main rahane vaale brahmanon kii patniyaan kisi baat par unki patni ahilya se naaraaz ho gayi
 He inspired his husbands to do sage Gautama
 un brahmanon ne iske nimitt bhagavan shriganeshji kii aradhana kii
 Pleased with his worship, Ganesha appeared and asked him to ask for the groom, those Brahmins said - 'prabhu! If you are happy with us then somehow get Rishi Gautama out of this ashram
 ' unki yah baat sunakar ganeshji ne unhen aisa var maangane ke liye samajhaayaa
 But he remained firm on his request
 antat ganeshji ko vivash hokar unki baat manani padi
 To keep the mind of his devotees, he took the form of a weak cow and started living in the field of sage Gautama
 gaay ko fasal charate dekhakar rishi badi narmi ke saath haath main trin lekar use haankane ke liye lapke
 As soon as those trunks were touched, that cow fell there itself
 ab to bada haahaakaar machaa
 All the Brahmins gathered and started denouncing the sage Gautama as a cow killer
 rishi gautam is ghatana se bahut aashcharyachakit or duhkhi the
 Now all those Brahmins said that you should leave this ashram and go somewhere else
 go-hatyare ke nikat rahane se hamen bhi paap lagegaa
 Being compelled, the sage Gautama started living with his wife Ahilya a curse away from there
 kintu un brahmanon ne vahaan bhi unka rahanaa dubhar kar diya
 They started saying - 'now you have no right to do the work of Vedas and Yajnadi due to cow slaughter
 ' atyant anunay bhav se rishi gautam ne un brahmanon se prarthana kii ki aap log mere praayshchit or uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataaen
 Then he said- 'gautam! You can revolve the whole earth thrice by telling your sins everywhere to everyone
 phir lautakar yahan ek maheene tak vrath karo
 After this, after doing 101 circumambulation of 'brahmagiri' you will be purified or bring Gangaji here and bathe with water and worship Shiva with one crore earthly Shivalingas
 iske baad punah gangaji main snaan karke is brahmagiri kii 11 baar parikrama karo

 Today most of the Hindu Dalits are attracted to Buddhism and are becoming, because Hindu Dalits have developed by becoming Buddhists
 "dalit" shabd kii vyakha, arth tulanaatmak drushti se dekhe to iskaa viruddh vishaleshan is prakaar he
 "dalit" -: pitied, exploited, suppressed, disgusted, depressed, torn, fragmented, broken, crushed, stifled, crushed, mashed, trampled, destroyed "falit" - : pidamukt, ucch, prasann, khushhaal, akhand, akhandit, jodna, samanta, ecreup, purnroop, sampurna The word dalit literally means dalan
 iske tahat vah har vyakti aa jaataa he jiskaa shoshan-utpedan hua he
 Ramachandra Varma wrote in his dictionary the meaning of Dalit, mashed, mourned, pressed, trampled or crushed, destroyed
 pichley chah-saat dashakon main 'dalit' pad kaa arth kaaphi badal gaya he
 After Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar's movement, this term has been used collectively for thousands of untouchable castes which have been considered untouchable for thousands of years, at the lowest rung in the Hindu social order
 ab dalit pad asprishy samajhi jane vaali jatiyon kii andolandharmita kaa parichaayak ban gaya he
 These castes are known as Scheduled Castes in the Indian Constitution
 bhartiya samaaj main valmiki yaa bhangi ko sabase nichi jati samajha jaataa rahaa he or uskaa paaramparik pesha maanav mel kii safai karnaa rahaa he
 But in today's time, this situation has changed a lot
 dalit kaa arth shankaracharya ne madhurashtakam main dwait se liya he
 He has addressed Shri Krishna by calling him "dalit Madhuram"
 bharat main dalit andolan kii shuruuaat jyotirav govindrav phule ke netritv main hui
 Jyotiba was a gardener from the caste and belonged to a section of the society who did not have the same rights as the upper caste
 iske baavjood jyotiba foole ne hameshaa hi tathakthith 'nichi' jati ke logon ke adhikaron kii pairvi kii
 In Indian society, Jyotiba's effort was to educate the Dalits
 jyotiba hi wo pehle shaks the jinhon daliton ke adhikaron ke saath-saath daliton kii shiksha kii bhi pairvi kii
 Along with this, Jyoti took tolerable steps for women's education
 bhartiya itihaas main jyotiba hi wo pehle shaks the jinhone daliton kii shiksha ke liye na keval vidhyalay kii vakaalat kii balki sabase pehle dalit vidhyalay kii bhi sthapana kii
 In Jyoti, Dalits were shown a path in Indian society, on which the Dalit society and other people later fought many battles for the rights of Dalits
 yun to jyotiba ne bharat main dalit andolanon kaa sutarapaat kiya tha lekin ise samaaj kii mukhyadhara se jodne kaa kaam babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar ne kiya
 Another thing that would be meaningless without mentioning the Dalit movement is Buddhism
 isa purv 600 isvi main hi buddha dharm ne hindu samaaj ke nichle tabakon ke adhikaron ke liye awaz uthaai
 Lord Gautam Buddha also initiated a social and political revolution through Buddhism
 ise raajnneetik kranti kahana isliye jaruri he kyonki us samay satta par dharm kaa aadhipaty tha or samaaj kii disha dharm ke dwaara hi tay kii jaati thi
 In such a situation, the direction of the revolution which Lord Buddha showed to the bottom table of the society is relevant even today
 bharat main charvak ke baad bhagwaan buddha hi pehle aise shaks the jinhone brahmanwad, jateevaad or andhvishwaas ke khilaaf na keval aawaaj uthaai balki ek darshan bhi diya
 So that the people of the society can be free from the chains of intellectual enslavement
 yadi samaaj ke nichle tabakon ke adolnon kaa adikaal se itihaas dekha jaae to charvak ko nakaarna bhi sambhav nahin hoga
 Although Charvac is accused of many types, Charvac was the first person who taught people to be free from the fear of God
 bhartiya darshan main charvak ne hi bina dharm or ishwar ke sukh kii kalpana kii
 Charvak is also seen raising the voice of Dalits on this pattern

 khayr baat ko lautaate hai us vakt jis vakt daliton ke adhikaron ko kanoonee jama pehanaane ke liye bharat ratna baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ne ladaai shuru kar di thi
 

then when our country India came under the category of British colony
 logon ke ye daastaa kaa samay rahaa ho lekin daliton ke liye kai myanon main swarnakaal tha
 Today, the background of whatever rights the Dalits have got in India was due to this rule
 europe main hue purnajagaran or gyanoday andolanon ke baad maanviya mulyon kaa mahima mandan hua
 These human values became the ideals of the revolution of Europe
 in aadarshon kii jariye hi europe main ek aise samaaj kii rachana kii gai jisamen maanviya mulyon ko praathamikta di gai
 It is different then that due to industrialization, these values were first replaced by capital in Europe
 

lekin iske baavjood europe main hi sabase pehle maanviya adhikaron ko kanoonee manyata di gai
 Its direct impact was bound to fall on India and it had to do
 iskaa sidhaa sa asar ham bharat ke samvidhan main dekh sakate hai
 All the articles from the preamble to the Indian Constitution appear to protect these human rights
 bharat main daliton kii kanoonee ladaai ladane kaa jimmaa sabase shashakt rup main dow ambedkar ne uthaaya
 Dr
 Ambedkar is the pioneer of Dalit society
 baba sahab ambedkar ne sabase pehle desh main daliton ke liye saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik adhikaron kii pairvi kii
 Clearly spoke of opposing the immediate nature of Indian society and the rights of the most backward and despised people of the society
 raajnneetik or saamaajik har rup main iskaa virodh swaabhaavik tha
 Even Mahatma Gandhi jumped in opposition to these demands
 baba sahab ne maang kii daliton ko alag pratinidhitiv milanaa chahie yah dalit raajnneeti main aaj tak kii sabase shashakt or prabal maang thi
 The breath of the Congress, which had assumed the responsibility of independence of the country on its shoulder, had also stopped at this demand
 kaaran saaf tha samaaj ke taane bane main logon kaa sidhaa swaarth nihit tha or koi bhi is taane bane main jaraa sa bhi badlaav nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Mahatma Gandhi was made to stick against it and was put on fast unto death
 aamaran anshan vaise hi desh ke mahatma ke sabase prabal hathiyaar tha or wo is hathiyaar ko aaye din apni baton ko manaane ke liye prayog karte rahete the
 Baba Saheb did not want to back down from this demand at any cost
 He knew that a simple withdrawal from this demand meant agreeing against the most important demand raised for Dalits
 lekin un par chaaron ore se dabaav padane laga
 And finally in an agreement called Poona Pact, the demand for the rights of Dalits was abolished by calling for religion
 in sabake baavjood drumbedkar ne haar nahin maani or samaaj ke nichle tabakon ke logon kii ladaai jari rakhi
 The result of Ambedkar's efforts is that the rights of Dalits were given a place in the Indian Constitution
 yahaan tak ki samvidhan ke moulik adhikaron ke jariye bhi daliton ke adhikaron kii raksha karne kii koshish kii gai
 Although the presence of the Dalit class in literature has been prominent since the Buddhist period, Dalit literature as a targeted human rights movement is largely a product of the twentieth century

 kahani kii mukhya paatr gangi apane biimaar pati ke liye kuen kaa saaf pani nahin laa paati he, kyonki ucch jati ke log daliton ko apane kuen se pani nahin laane dete hai
 Dalits are beginning to feel that the exit from Hinduism may be a better way for them as the condition of the newly born Buddhists has improved over the years, while the life of Hindu Dalits has not changed much despite being organized as a vote bank

 According to the 2001 census, the sex ratio of girls and boys among Buddhists is 942, higher than the 938 for Hindu Dalits
 yah ling anupaat hinduon, sikh kii tulana main bahut adhik he, or jain

 In ancient times there were no universities in the recognized sense in the countries of Europe, although there were many important schools, such as the philosophical schools of Athens, or the schools of literature and customs of Rome, which were higher education institutions
 madhya yug main shiksha par dharmik sansthaaon kaa niyantran rahaa
 Religious institutions arranged schools in which clergy were taught religious, literary and scientific subjects

 Later, expert teachers and students jointly run the university
 12veen shatabdi ke madhya ke aasapaas bolona main kanoon ke vidhyaarthiyon ke prayaas se ek kanoon vishvavidhyalay sthapit kiya gaya
 Around 1250 AD, the word 'university' started being used in a new sense and instead of erudite students, the rulers started establishing political and social needs of their states
 madhyayugin vishvavidhyalay 13veen shatabdi ke madhya ke sarvotkrisht samay main bauddhik swatantraaa kii adwitiya avasthaa ko prakat karte hai
 Their progress was not interrupted due to money and they were able to resist the efforts that destroyed their independent rights

 The university came to be regarded as the institution for initiating workers for the state and related expenses
 ye vishvavidhyalay dharmik sansthaaon se sambandhit hote hue bhi 16veen shatabdi ke dharmik sangharshon se dur rahe
 Universities became centers of scientific discoveries in this century

 vaigyanik vishyon ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya gaya
 Universities of this period became not only science but also the center of politics and they did important work by creating permanent sense of nationality in national uplift of different countries
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak vishvavidhyalay kaa sambandh janata ke saath kaaphi ghanishtha ho gaya

 Thus gradually the university moved away from the predominantly religious area and became related to the masses

 The University Grants Committee lays greater emphasis on the institution's teaching

 Due to the spread of education at the secondary level, the number of students in universities is increasing and the question is whether universities should place all the students who want to study further, or choose only those who are able to benefit from higher education
 The What is the medium of education ?, is also an important question

 Ethane, propane, etc
 are followed by which one carbon is added respectively
 hydrocarbon teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai: ethane shrenee, ethilin shrenee or asitilin shrenee
 Ethane-grade hydrocarbons are saturated, ie, the amount of hydrogen in them cannot be increased further
 ethilin main do carbonon ke bich main ek dwibandh he, asitilin main trigun bandha vaale yogic asthaayee hai
 It can easily get oxidised and halogenated
 hydrocarbonon ke bahut se vyutpann taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinke vividh upyog hai
 Such derivatives are chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohol, sodium alkoxide, amine, mercaptan, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen sulfate
 asatrupt hydrocarbon adhik sakriy hota he or anek abhikaarakon se sanyukt ha saralata se vyutpann banaata he
 Many such derivatives have proved to be of great importance from an industrial point of view
 inase anek bahumoolya vilaayak, plastic, kriminashak oshadhiyaan aadi praapt hui hai
 The oxidation of hydrocarbons gives alcohol ether, ketones, aldehydes, fatty acids, esters, etc
 alcodaul praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak ho sakate hai
 Their ester fluids are aromatic
 anek sugandhit dravya inase taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Similarly, vitamin B5 can also be taken in various uses

 Judicial science or forensic science is the science of answering questions that aid the judicial process using different types of sciences
 ye nyaayik prashn kisi aparaadh se sambandhit ho sakate hai yaa kisi divaani maamle se jude ho sakate hai
 Forensic science is primarily concerned with the application of scientific principles to the investigation of crime
 forensik vaigyanik atyaadhunik praudyogiki ke istemaal se aparaadh sthal se ekatra kiye gaye suraagon ko adaalat main prastut karne ke vaaste sweekaarya saboot ke taur par inhen parivartit karte hai
 This process is the application or application of science in courts or legal proceedings

 These evidences may include blood marks, saliva, any other body fluids, hair, fingerprints, footwear and tire marks, explosives, poisons, blood and urine tissue, etc
 unki visheshgyata in sabooton ke prayog se tathy nirdhaaran karne main hi nihit hoti he
 They have to prepare their investigation report and appear in court to give evidence
 ve adaalat main sweekaarya vaigyanik saboot uplabdh karaane ke liye police ke saath nikatataa se kaam karte hai
 Judicial science is a subject in which criminal investigation and testing of evidence is done
 Some principles have been made to perform these tests, which are as follows: locard kaa vinium kaa siddhanth - jab koi do vyakti vastu ek dusre ke sparsh me aati he to dono kaa aapas me ek dusre kii sataha par dono ke kuch ashan kaa aadan pardaan ho jaataa he| Principle of probability - Identifying and combusting an object, place and person based on probability
 tathy kaa siddhanth- yah siddhanth kahata he kii manushya jhooth bol saktaa he par tathy kabhi jhooth nahi bolte
 Principle of Equality - Always identical and same things are matched together
 vishistataa kaa siddhanth - sabhi vastu vyakti kii apni ek ektai hoti he chaahe wo ek samaan paratit ho athwa ek hi parkaar se taiyaar kiya gaya ho parantu sabhaki apni visheshta hoti he
 Principle of investigation - The investigation of any fact depends on the correctness of that fact and its condition
 badlaav kaa niyam - har vyakti vastu kaa samay ke saath usame badlaav aata he jise badlaav kaa niyam kehete hai

 Nuclear acid is a polymeric macromolecule, which is made up of chains of unicellular nucleotides
 jaivaraciniki ke pariprekshya main, ye anu anuvaanshik soochna pahunchaane kaa kaam karte hai, saath hi ye koshikaon kaa dhaanchaa bhi banaate hai
 Commonly used nuclear acids are DNA or deoxy ribo nuclear acid and RNA or ribo nuclear acid
 nabhikeey amla praaniyon main sadaa hi upasthit hota he, kyonki yah sabhi koshikaon or yahan tak kii vishaanuon main bhi hota he
 Nuclear acid was discovered by Frederick Miescher
 kritrim nabhikeey amlon main aate hai: To identify all of them separately from the natural DNA and RNA, it is used to change the backbone of the molecule
 nabhikeey amla turm ko bypolimar parivaar, jiskaa koshika kendrak main khaas kaary he; ke sadasyon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 The monomer of nuclear acid is called nucleotide

 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule

 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'

 Gandhiji himself did not participate in this movement but he gave his blessings to this movement and he did the same with a farmer Satyagraha to be held in Bardoli this year
 1929 main disambar ke ant main congress ne apana vaarshik adhiveshan lahore shahar main kiya
 This session was important in two respects: the election of Jawaharlal Nehru as the President, symbolizing the handing over of the leadership stick to the younger generation and the proclamation of 'purna Swaraj' or complete independence
 ab raajnneeti kii gati ek baar fir bad gai thi | On 26 JAN 1930, 'independence Day' was celebrated by hoisting the national flag at various places and singing patriotic songs
 gandhi ji ne swayan suspasht nirdesh dekar bataaya ki is din ko kaise manaaya janaa chahie
 He said that if the proclamation of independence is good in all villages and all cities, even
 agar sabhi jagahon par ek hi samay main sangoshtiyaan hon to acha hoga
 Gandhiji suggested that the time of the seminar be announced by beating the drum with a traditional arrow
 rashtriya dhvaj ko fahraae jane se samarohon kii shuruyaat hogi
 The rest of the day will be spent in any creative work, whether it is spinning yarn or serving the 'untouchables' or reuniting Hindus and Muslims or prohibited work or doing all these together and it is not impossible

 Immediately after celebrating 'independence Day', Mahatma Gandhi announced that he would lead a visit to break one of the most despicable laws of British India, which gave the state a monopoly on the production and sale of salt
 namak ekadhikaar ke jis mudde kaa unhone chayan kiya tha vah gandhi ji kii kushal samajhadaari kaa ek anya udhaahrantha
 The use of salt was unavoidable in every Indian household, but in spite of this they were also prevented from making salt for domestic use and thus they were forced to buy salt from shops at a high price
 namak par rajya kaa ekadhpitya bahut alokapriy tha
 Targeting this, Gandhiji was thinking of organizing widespread dissatisfaction against the British rule
 adhikansh bharatiyon ko gandhi ji kii is chunauti kaa mahatv samaj main aa gaya tha kintu angreji raaj ko nahin
 Although Gandhi ji had informed the Viceroy Lord Irwin about his 'salt March', but Irwin could not understand the importance of his action
 12 march 1930 ko gandhi ji ne sabarmati main apane ashram se samudr kii ore chalanaa shuru kiya
 Three weeks later he reached his destination

 Meanwhile, parallel salt trips were organized in other parts of the country

 Like 1920-22, Gandhiji's call this time also inspired all Indian sections to express their dissatisfaction against colonial rule

 In a village called Vasna, Gandhiji had addressed the upper caste and said that if you raise your voice in favor of Swaraj, then you have to serve the untouchables
 sirf namak kar yaa anya karon ke khatm ho jane se aapako swaraj nahin mil jayega
 For Swaraj you have to atone your mistakes that you have done to the untouchables

 The progress of the Salt March can also be understood from one more point

 The magazine made fun of his pillow-like body and spider-like legs
 is yatra ke bare main apni pehali report main hi time ne namak yatra ke manzil tak pahunchne par apni gahari shankaa vyakt kar di thi
 He claimed that Gandhiji had fallen on the ground after walking on the second day
 patrika ko is baat par vishwaas nahin tha ki is marial sadhu ke sharir main or aage jane kii takat bachi he
 But in one night, the thinking of the magazine changed
 time ne likhaa ki is yatra ko jo baari jansamarthan mil rahaa he usne angrej shaskaon ko baichaiyn kar diya he
 Now they too have started saluting Gandhi ji by calling him a monk and public leader who is using Christian methods as a weapon against the Christian religious people
 namak yatra kam se kam teen kaarnon se ullekhneey thi
 First, it was this incident that caused Mahatma Gandhi to come into the eyes of the world
 is yatra ko europe or america press ne vyapak kawarej di
 Secondly, this was the first nationalist activity in which women also participated actively
 samaajawaadee kaaryakarta kamaladevi chatopadhyaay ne gandhi ji ko samajhaayaa ki ve apane andolanon ko purushon tak hi simit na rakhen
 Kamaladevi herself was one of the numerous women who gave mass arrests in violation of salt or liquor laws
 teesraa or sambhavat: sabase mahatvapurn kaaran yah tha ki namak yatra ke kaaran hi angrejon ko yah ahsaas hua tha ki ab unka raaj bahut din nahin tik sakegaa or unhen bharatiyon ko bhi satta main hissaa dena padegaa

 abhigyaan shaakuntalam mahakavi kalidas kaa vishwavikhyath naatak he jiskaa anuwaad praaia: sabhi videshi bhashaaon main ho chukaa he
 It has a beautiful story of love, marriage, marriage, reprisal and reunion of King Dushyant and Shakuntala
 puranic katha main dushyant ko akashwani dwaara bodh hota he par is naatak main kavi ne mudrika dwaara iskaa bodh karaayaa he
 Its theatricality, its beautiful narratives, its poetic-aesthetic analogies, and the periodic notes used from place to place; And above all, the acoustics of the diverse episodes are so amazing that even Sanskrit dramas cannot compete with Abhigyan Shakuntal when viewed from these points of view; Then what to say about other languages! So this is the best thing here
 kalidas ne abhigyaan shaakuntal kii kathavstu moulik nahin chuni
 This story is derived from the Adiparva of the Mahaharata
 yon padmapurana main bhi shakuntla kii katha milti he or vah mahabharat kii apeksha shakuntala kii katha ke adhik nikat he
 For this reason, Winternitz has assumed that the story of Shakuntala is derived from Padmapurana
 parantu vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki padmapurana kaa yah bhaag shakuntala kii rachana ke baad likhaa or baad main prakshipt prathit hota he
 The curse of Durvasa is not mentioned in the Mahabharata story
 mahabharat kaa dushyant se yadi thik ulataa nahin, to bhi bahut adhik bhinn he
 Shakuntala of Mahabharata is not as well-groomed as that of Kalidasa
 vah dushyant ko vishwamitra or menka ke sambandh ke falswarup hue apane janm kii katha apane munh se hi sunaati he
 In the Mahabharata, Dushyant, enchanted by the appearance of Shakuntala, prays Gandharva marriage to Shakuntala; On which Shakuntala says that i can marry on the condition that the throne be given to my son only
 dushyant us samay to sweekaar kar letaa he or baad main apni rajdhani main lautakar jaan-boojhkar lajjawash shakuntala ko grahan nahin karata
 Kalidasa has refined the narrative thus received in unsophisticated form to his imagination
 durvasa ke shaap kii kalpana karke unhone dushyant ke charitra ko ooncha uthaaya he
 Shakuntala of Kalidasa is also an idol of nobility, beauty and compassion
 iske atirikt kalidas ne sari katha kaa nirvaah, bhaavon kaa chithran ityadi jis dhang se kiya he, vah moulik or apurv he
 Shakuntala was the wife of King Dushyant who was the mother of India's well-known king Bharata and the daughter of Maneka Apsara
 mahabharat main likhaa he ki shankutala kaa janm menka apsara ke garbh se hua tha jo ise van main chhodkar chali gai thi
 It was named Shakuntala by the Shankutas etc
 in the forest which protected it from predatory animals
 van main se ise kanv rishi uthaa laae the or apane ashram main rakhkar kanya ke samaan paalate the
 Once King Dushyant went out to hunt with some soldiers with him and roamed the ashram of Kanva Rishi
 rishi us samay vahaan upasthit nahin the; isse yuvati shakuntla ne hi raja dushyant kaa aatithy satkar kiya
 On the same occasion, the two married Prem and then Gandharva
 kuch dinon baad raja dushyant vahaan se apane rajya ko chale gaye
 When Kanva Muni came back, he was very happy to know that Shakuntala was married to Dushyant
 shakuntla us samay garbhvatee ho chuki thi
 With time, a very powerful and bright son was born from her womb, named 'bharata'
 kehete hai, 'bharat' naam 'bharat' ke naam par hi padaa
 a few days later Shakuntala took her son to Dushyant's court
 parantu shakuntla ko bich main durvasa rishi kaa shaap mil chukaa tha
 The king did not recognize it at all and said clearly that neither i know you nor can you give me shelter here
 parantu isi avasar par ek akashwani hui, jisase raja ko vidit hua ki yah meri hi patni he or yah putr bhi meraa hi he
 He remembered all the things about Kanva Muni's ashram and kept Shakuntala as his head queen
 ‘abhigyaan shaakuntalam’ main anek maarmik prasangon ko ullekh kiya gaya he
 One, when Dushyant and Shakuntala meet for the first time
 doosraa us samay, jab kanv shakuntala ko apane ashram se patigrih ke liye vidaa karte hai
 At that time, the sage himself says that if a sage like me has this fascination in his parents, then what will be the situation of those whose daughters are leaving for the house
 teesraa prasang he, shakuntala kaa dushyant kii sabha main upasthit hona or dushyant ko usko pahchaanane se inkaar karnaa
 The fourth episode is of the time when a ring with the name of Dushyant received by the fisherman is shown to him
 or paanchvaan prasang marichi maharishi ke ashram main dushyant-shakuntala ke milan kaa
 The greatest miracle of Kalidasa in Shakuntala is in his phonetic signs
 isamen kavi ko vilakshan safalataa yah mili he ki usne kahin bhi koi bhi vastu nishprayojan nahin kahi
 No character, any narrative statement, any incident, no natural scene is useless
 sabhi ghatnaayen yah drishy aage aane vaali ghatnaon kaa sanket chamatkaarik reeti se pehle hi de dete hai
 In the beginning of the play, while narrating the summer, the story of the drama was broadly communicated by feeling fragrant, falling asleep and lying in the shadows and being delightful at the end of the day, with the fragrance of the forest floor
 Has gone, indicating the meeting of Shakuntala and Dushyant respectively, then forgetting Shakuntala with sleep-effects and ending the play with pleasure
 isi prakaar naatak ke praarambhik geet main bhramaron dwaara shiris ke phulon ko zaraa-zaraa-sa chuumane se yah sanket miltaa he ki dushyant or shakuntala kaa milan alpasthayee hoga
 Some ascetics stop coming when the king is running after the stag with an arrow on the bow
 kehete hai-‘maharaj’ yah ashram kaa harin he, is par tir na chalaanaa
 'in addition to the stag here, there is also a hint towards Shakuntala, who is naive and helpless like the stag
 ‘kahaan to harinon kaa atyant chanchal jivan or kahaan tumhaare vajra ke samaan kathor baan !’ isse bhi shakuntala kii asahaayta or saralata tathaa raja kii nishthurataa kaa marmasparshi sanket kiya gaya he
 When Dushyanta and Shakuntala's love starts to grow a bit more, then the cry from the back is heard saying, "tapaswiyo, get ready to protect the creatures of the ashram
" shikari raja dushyant yahaan aayaa hua he
 'there also appears to have been a hint of the defense of Shakuntala from Dushyant's hands, but this signal was not heard in anyone's ear; Nobody saved Shakuntala
 isse sthiti kii karunajanakta or bhi adhik bad jaati he
 In the early part of the fourth issue, the disciple of Kanva while describing Prabhat mentioned the constant association of happiness and sorrow and unbearable grief of women in the separation of the beloved, before Dushyanta abandoned Shakuntala
 Makes the background-c from itself
 paanchaven ank main rani hansapadika ek geet gaati hai, jisamen raja ko unki madhur-vritti ke liye ulaahna diya gaya he
 Dushyanta also confesses that he has loved Hanspadika only once
 isse kavi yah gambheer sanket detaa he ki bhale hi shakuntala ko dushyant ne durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran bhuulakar choda, parantu ek baar pyaar karne ke baad raniyon kii upeksha karnaa unke liye koi nai baat nahin thi
 Other queens were also victims of this sweet attitude
 hansapadika ke is geet kii prishthbhumi main shakuntala ke parityag kii ghatana or bhi krur or kathor jaan padati he
 By similar phonetic gestures, Kalidasa has set a pleasant backdrop for Dushyant, Shakuntala and his son in the seventh issue
 indra raja dushyant ko apurv sammaan pradaan karte hai
 After that, upon reaching Hemkut mountain, Prajapati's ashram, the king starts feeling as if he is bathing in the lake of nectar
 is prakaar ke sanketon ke baad dushyant or shakuntala kaa milan or bhi adhik manohar ho uthta he
 German poet Goethe had said about Abhigyan Shakuntalam- isi prakaar sanskrit ke vidwaanon main yah shloke prasiddh he- This means - Among all the forms of poetry, drama is particularly beautiful
 naatakon main bhi kavy-soundarya kii drushti se abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan main bhi uskaa chaturth ank or is ank main bhi chauthaa shloke to bahut hi romantic he
 In Abhigyan Shakuntal, there is a considerable amount of poetry as well as a portion of poetry
 isamen shringaar mukhya ras he; or uske sanyog tathaa viyog donon hi pakshon kaa paripaak sundar rup main hua he
 Apart from this, there is good expression of humor, valor and Karun Ras
 sthaan-sthaan par sundar or manoharini utprekshaayen na keval pathak ko chamatkrit kar detii hai, kintu abhisht bhav kii tivrata ko badhaane main hi sahaayak hoti hai
 In all the plays, Kalidas did not use his similes and motivations for mere ornamentation
 prayek sthaan par unki upama yaa utpreksha arth kii abhivyakti ko raspurn banane main sahaayak hui he
 Kalidas is famous in Sanskrit literature for his similes
 shaakuntal main bhi unki upyukt upama chunane kii shakti bhalee-bhaanti prakat hui
 In one place about Shakuntala, King Dushyant says that 'it is a flower that no one has smelled; Such is the Navapallava, which does not scratch anyone's fingernails; There is a gem, which is not pierced and there is a honey, which no one has tasted
 ’ in upamaaon ke dwaara shakuntala ke saundarya kii ek anokhi jhalak hamaari ankhon ke saamne aa jaati he
 Similarly, in the fifth issue Dushyanta abandons Shakuntala, saying, "O Tapaswini, do you want to tarnish your clan and impure me, like a river that breaks the coast and falls down the tree of the shore and It also taps its water
 ’ yahaan shakuntala kii chat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi se di gai upama raja ke manobhaav ko vyakt karne main vishesh rup se sahaayak hoti he
 Similarly, when Kanva's disciples take Shakuntala and reach Dushyant, Dushyant's vision falls on the Shakuntala among those ascetics
 vahaan shakuntala ke saundarya kaa vistrut varnan na karke kavi ne unke mukh se keval itnaa kahalava diya he ki ‘in tapasviyon ke bich main vah ghunghat vaali sundari koun he, jo pile patton ke bich main nai konpal ke samaan dikhaai pad rahi he
 'this small upma has depicted the beauty of Shakuntala by the goodness of the yellow leaves and the buds
 isi prakaar sarvadman ko dekhakar dushyant kehete hai ki ‘yah pratapi balak us agni ke sphuling kii bhaanti prathit hota he, jo dadhakati aag banane ke liye idhan kii raah dekhtaa he
 With this upma, Kalidas not only revealed the brilliance of the child, but has also clearly conveyed that this child will grow up to become the glorious Chakravarti emperor
 is prakaar kii manohar upamaaon ke anek udhaaharan shaakuntal main se diye ja sakate hai kyonki shaakuntal main 180 upamaayen prayukt huin hai
 And all of them surpass one by one
 yah thik he upama ke chunaav main kalidas ko vishesh kushalta praapt thi or yah bhi thik he ki unki-si sundar upmaayen anya kaviyon kii rachanaaon main durlabh hai, phir bhi kalidas kii sabase badi visheshta upama-kaushal nahin he
 Upma-kaushal is a common part of his poetry skills
 apane manobhaav ko vyakt karne athwa kisi ras kaa paripaak karne athwa kisi bhav kii teevr anubhuti ko jagaane kii kalidas anek vidhiyaan jaanate hai
 Kalidas has made his style particularly delightful by using a contextual selection of words, choosing the appropriate verses of the desired sense and using euphemism
 jahaan kalidas shakuntala ke soundarya-varnan par utre hai, vahaan unhone keval upamaaon or utprekshaon dwaara shakuntala kaa rup chithran karke hi santosh nahin kar liya he
 At first, he merely said that 'if there is so much form among the residents of Tapovan, then understand that the forest vines beat the vines of the garden
 ’ phir dushyant ke mukh se unhone kahalwaya ki ‘itani sundar kanya ko ashram ke niyam-paalan main lagaana aisa hi he jaise nil camel kii pankhuri se babul kaa ped kaatna
 'after that, Kalidas says that' Shakuntala's form is so beautiful that even though she is wearing a thick vulcanic cloth, then her beauty is not reduced to anything, but it has increased
 kyonki sundar vyakti ko jo bhi kuch pahana diya jaae vahi uskaa aabhushan ho jaataa he
 'he then compares Sukumar's body of King Shakuntala with the green flower-laden Lata, so that the image of that unique beauty is painted in front of the reader's eyes
 iske baad us saundarya kii anubhuti ko charam seemaa par pahunchane ke liye kalidas ek bhramar ko le aae hai; jo shakuntala ke mukh ko ek sundar khilaa hua phool samajhakar uskaa rasapan karne ke liye uske upar mandaraane lagata he
 Thus, Kalidasa did not take the support of the antlers to portray the beauty of Shakuntala as much as the euphemism; And this cuisine is considered to be the life of poetry

 It is also a major tributary of the River Thames
 rang suchak ek saral sankhya hoti he jis se kisi vastu kaa rang bataaya jaataa he
 In astronomy, there is a deep correlation between the color of a star and its temperature, so the color indicator of a star shows its temperature
 kisi vastu kaa rang suchak maapne ke liye use do alag prakaash-filtaron se dekhakar uski chamak maapi jaati he
 Some of the filters are: inke aadhaar par U–B, B–V or V–R jasi rang suchak paribhaashit hai
 The smaller the color indicator for the star, the blue the star and the hotter it is
 kisi taare kaa rang suchak agar bada he, tara utana hi laal or utana hi thanda hota he
 The b – v color indicator of our sun is 0
656 ± 0
005 and is yellowish-colored, while the B-V color indicator of the Rajyan star is –0
03, which means it is colored blue
 yadi rajanya taare ke b or v filtaron se maape gaye magnitude ko dekha jaae to iskaa b magnitude 0
09 he jabaki iskaa v magnitude 0
12 he, yani B–V = –0
03 he
 Keep in mind that magnitude is such an inverted measurement that the higher the brightness, the less

 Sunni Muslims believe that the first four Caliphs, including Hazrat Ali, were Satapathis, while Shia Muslims believe that the first three Caliphs were non-legitimate heads of Islam and that they start counting the Imams from Hazrat Ali and that the use of the word Khalifa in this count do not do
 sunni muslim ali ko caliph bhi maanate he or unke putr hossain ko maravane vaale caliph yajid ko kai jagahon par pathbhrasht muslim kehete hai
 The majority of the followers of this sect live mainly in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain and Azerbaijan
 iske alaava syria, kuwait, turki, afghanistan, pakistan, oman, yaman tathaa bharat main bhi shiya aabaadi ek pramukh alpsankhyak ke rup main he
 There are three subdivisions of the faith of Shia Islam - Barhwari, Ismaili and Zaidi
 ek mashhoor haddees mankunto maula fa ha ja ali un maula, jo mohammad sahab ne gadir naamak jagah par apane aakhri haj par khutba diya tha, main spasht kah diya tha ki musalmaan samudaay ko samudaay ali ke kahe kaa anusaran karnaa he
 In 632 , Muhammad Sahab addressed his companions near Khumm Sarovar in his last hajj
 shiya vishwaas ke anusaar is kitaab main unhone apane damaad ali ko apana vaaris banaaya tha
 Sunnis consider this incident to be praise for Ali and believe that he did not appoint Hazrat Ali as caliph
 isi baat ko lekar dono pakshon main matbhed shuru hota he
 After the Hajj, Muhammad Sahib began to remain ill
 unhone sabhi bade sahaabiyon ko bula kar kaha ki mujhe kalam daavaat de do ki main tumko esa navishta likh don ki tum bhatko nahin to umr ne kaha ki ye hijayaan kah rahe he or nahin dene diya 
 According to Shia history, even when news of Prophet's death was received, he did not come back and started gathering in Sakifa, what should be done now
 jis samay hazarat mohammad kii mrityu hui, ali or unke kuch or mitra mohammad sahab ko dafanaane main lage the, abu baqar madina main jaakar kilaafat ke liye vimarsh kar rahe the
 Many people of Medina agreed to make Abu Bakr a caliph
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar mohammad sahib evam ali ke kabeeley vaale yani bani hashim ali ko hi khalipha bananaa chaahate the
 But there was no solidarity among the Muslims to inherit the largest empire of Islam ever
 kai logon ke anusaar ali, jo mohammad sahab ke chachere bhai the or damaad bhi hi mohammad sahab ke asli vaaris the
 But Abu Bakr was first made Khalifa and after his death Umar was made Khalifa
 isse ali ke samarthak logon main or bhi rosh failaa parantu ali musalamaanon kii bhalaai ke liye chup rahe
 Usman became the third Khalifa after Omar
 parantu inke samay main shiya rafazi baagiyon logon ne misr tathaa iraq va anya sthano se aakar madina main aakar osman ke ghar ko gher liya 40 din tak osman ke ghar ko gheraav kiya ant main osman ko shahid kar daalaa
 When Osman bin Afan was martyred, he was 79 years old, he was stabbed repeatedly in the head, his wife came to save him, he cut his finger, the tigress came to his house from the back side, in the front
 Hussain Ibne Ali and Hasan Ibne Ali, both sons of Hazrat Ali, were guarding! ab phir se calipha kaa pad khaali tha or islamic samrajya bada ho rahaa tha
 No one saw Muslims other than Hazrat Ali, but Ali did not believe in becoming a Khalifa
 kai din shura ke log khalipha ke pad ko na bhar sake
 Finally, when Ali was forced, you said that Ilahi Nizam would work in my Khilafat
 unhen chauthaa khaliph niyukt kiya gaya
 Ali was famous for his justice, when Ali became the Khalifa, the demand of the former Khalifa Usman's revenge and punishment for him started arising, but seeing the situation of the Muslims and Muslims, Ali did not take any action but the people did not When Raas came, he used an army to punish the killers of Osman
 ali ne kaha osman ke katilo ko sajaa zarur milegi, par inka udyeshy kuch or tha to jamal naamak jang hui
 Sometime later, Mu'awiya, the Subedar of Syria, also opposed Ali
 muavia tisare khaliph osman kaa rishtedaar tha or usee osman ke katilo ke sajaa kii maang se sifphine main jang hui jisamen muavia bhi haar gaya
 In 661, Imam Ali was deceitfully martyred in a mosque in Kufa
 iske baad muavia ne apane ko islam kaa caliph ghoshit kar diya
 Proponents of Hazrat Ali and theoretically Muhammad sa Sahib's relatives showed allegiance to his son Hasan, but some left him
 hasan ibne ali ne jang na kii balki maviya ke saath sandhi kar lee
 Actually, in the time of Ali, in the battle of Siffin, Mavia wanted to become Khalifa
 wo syria kaa governor pichle khalifaaon ke kaaran bane the ab wo apni ek badi sena taiyaar kar rahe the ab usne vahi sawaal imam hasan ke saamne rakhaa: yaa to yuddh yaa phir adheenta
 Imam Hasan did not accept subjugation but he did not want to shed the blood of the Muslims, so he stayed away from the war
 ab maavia bhi kisi bhi tarah satta chaahate the to imam hasan se sandhi karne par majaboor ho gaye
 Imam Hassan handed over power to him only on his terms
 in sharto main se kuch ye hai: - Through such conditions, he became the ruler of a mere name
 uske vansh kaa shashan 750 isvi tak rahaa or unhen umayyad kaha gaya
 All the Tehreek of Shia Muslims consider Ali's younger son and his 11 sons as successors of Islam after Hazrat Muhammad Sahab
 iname sabase pehle imam hasan alhisslam kaa naam aata he, aap imam ali ke jyeshtha putr the or aap ne imam ali ke baad 47 saal kii aayu main khilaafat sambhaali
 You remained the Khalifa for only 6 months, after which you resigned from political rule after the treaty with Mawiya, but you continued to guide your followers under the honorable post of Imam, who came to you after Imam Ali a
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar aapako mavia ne sajeesh karke shahid kar diya
 According to your will, Imam Hussain took over the post of Imam after you
 aapse hi karbala kii mahaan katha sambandhit he
 When you explicitly refused to support Yavid, the malicious son of Mavia, you were surrounded and martyred by an army of 30,000 or more, including your family and friends, who were 72 in total
 aap par or aapke parivaar par pani 3 din pehle se hi band tha
 In memory of this, every year your followers celebrate the world famous and sacred festival of Muharram
