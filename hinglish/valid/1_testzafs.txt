 It can be further clarified

 Creating according to certain principles and proportions determined by nature, intelligence and interest is a related part of this art

 In the early stages, or with self-realization, architecture takes place in the occupations, or occupations necessary for the limited purposes of humans — often to provide some kind of defense for humans
 kisi jati ke itihaas main vaastukritiyaan mahatvapurn tab hoti hai, jab unamem kisi ansh tak sabhyataa, samruddhi or vilasita aa jaati he or unamem jati ke garv, pratishtha, mahatvakanksha or aadhyatmikta kii prakruti purnataya abhivyakt hoti he
 In ancient times architecture was said to be the mother of all arts
 kintu vritti ke parivartan ke saath or sambhddha vyavsaayon ke bhaag lene par yah samaveshak sangrakshan kii muhar ab nahin rahi
 Architecture is also said to bring to light the social status of the ancient period
 yah vahiin tak thik he jahaan tak saamaajik evam anya uplabdhiyon kaa prabhaav he
 It has also been said that architecture is nothing more than ornamentation of buildings
 jahaan tak aitihaasik vaastukala kaa sambandh he, yah anshat: satya he
 Then architecture is also called the mold of civilization
 jahaan tak puratatviya prabhaav he, yah thik he kintu vaastukala ke itihaas par ek sankshipt drushtipaat se yah spasht ho jayega ki maanav ke pracheenatam prayaas shikariyon ke adikalin gupha-awaason, charavaahon ke charm-tambuon or kisaanon ke jhopadon ke rup main dekh padate hai
 Boat dwellings and tree huts are ancient features

 In these primitive endeavors and in their improved forms, some things are so important and distinctive in all the countries that they are evident even in the greatest art works of a long time later
 yugon ke drut vikascram main vaastukala vikasi, dhali or maanav kii parivartansheel aavashyaktaaon ke - uski suraksha, kaary, dharm, anand or anya yugaprarvatak chihnon, anuroop bani
 The plain form of Egypt, the standard design of China, the exotic and rich nature of India, the majestic majesty of Maya and Aztec of Mexico, the highly developed devotionals of Greece, the complex types of buildings that served the multiple needs of the Roman Empire, the ancient marched churches
 , The Great Gothic Church Building and Chitropam Fort, the excellent configuration and proportions of Turkish buildings and the grand architecture of European revival Numeric monuments present an account of the continuous development of historical architecture
 ye sab imaaraten maanav vikaas ke mahaan yugon kii ore ingit karti hai, jinamein vaastukala jaateey jivan se atyadhik sambandhit hone ke kaaran un jatiyon kii pratibha or mahatvakanksha kaa, jinaki unke smarakon par suspasht chhap hai, digdarshan karaati hai
 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation
 purakalin isaayiyon main yah isamsih kii sachhee saadagi or gaurav vyakt karanevaale girjagharon ke nirmaan ke prati baari utsaah ke rup main tha; gothic nirmaataaon main yah sanrachana yantriki ke gyaan se yukt utkar shakti thi; italvi punaruddhar main yah us yug kii vidvatta thi
 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is evident in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory
 in tamaam saalon main vaastukala samayik chetana paryaavaran tathaa sthaneey prishthbhumi ke saamanjasy main viksit hui
 Even today, we keep looking for the most suitable forms for talented people
 aaj kuch aise vaastu hai jo bhoot kaa anusaran karne main hi santusht hai kuch anya hai jo videshi dhang kaa anukaran karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 There are very few who are trying to develop Vastu according to their time, pace and national vision
 is chote se varg kaa prayaas nayaa sanghaat prastut karne kaa he, jo manushya kaa nae vichaar sochane or dhaaran karne kii prerana detaa he
 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he
 Poetry is impressive when sung in a sweet tone, but when it is accompanied by appropriate music and rhythmic dance efforts, it not only attracts the human heart and the different senses, but also the whole atmosphere created by their glorious combination
 She makes him aware
 isi prakaar vaastukalpanaayen, darshanik gatividhiyon se, kavyamay abhivyaktiyon se or sammilit layaatmak, sangitatmak tathaa varnatmak arthon se paripurna hoti hai or aisi utkrisht vaastukritiyaan maanav ke antarmanas ko chooti hui sabhi prakaar se uski prashansa kaa paatr hoti hai or phir vishwavyaapee khyaati arjeet karti hai
 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies
 yadi is sandarbh main dekhe to vaastukala vyakti ke apane sarjak man kii sampurna evam suviksit rachana honi chahie, jo swayambhu ke ucch str tak pahunchati he

 While some politicians and lobbyists are still arguing about global warming, climate change, and the role of different social classes that many businesses have recognized, those who are friendly to the environment and society are also consumers
 kaarobaar bhi samajhate hai ki in logon ko apane vishwaason ke bare main bahut bhavuk hai kyonki ve companiyaan he, ki unhen puraa pasand karte hai
 Recognition by established companies as well has created enough momentum for new companies to take notice

 In addition, as more people embrace organic foods, they look for other ways to reduce their own footprint on the planet
 satat vipanan unhen sahi disha main le jate hai, ve na keval ek chote prabhaav ke liye, parantu yah bhi he ki companiyon ko yah acchhee tarah se upyog karne ke liye bada laabh ke liye kehete hai
 Creating consumer demand for sustainable products and services is not an easy task, as consumers have traditionally not found behaviors to maximize their utility
 kai upabhoktaaon ko lagata he ki jo kuch bhi lambey samay main puure samaaj ke liye acha he vahi hameshaa alpavadhi main vyaktiyon ke liye sabase acha vikalp he or durbhaagya se upabhoktaaon ke adhikansh ke liye sthaayee vikaas ke prati sakaaratmak drushtikon unke vaastavik upabhokta vyavhaar main dikhaaya gaya he
 The Sustainable Consumer Practices position consumers' sustainable behavior with selfishness and ensure that this selfishness is explained, which can be created and enhanced and well recognized and acted upon
 sthaayee vipanan ke uddeshy main shaamil hai or vipanan ke prayaas main paryaavaran sambandhi chintaaon gathbandhan karne ke liye hai; iskaa matlab yah he ki upabhoktaaon ko tikaoo utpaadon peshkash karne par behatar he, adhik purna or adhik sankshipt jaankaree bhi di jaati he agar yah adhik se adhik companiyon ko drive utpaadon or sevaaon ke bare main yah bataata he ki paryaavaran ke liye acha kar rahe hai to utpaadan hoga
 Sustainable marketing is not only by labeling green products but also working with product, promotion, price and placement positioning strategies and also engaging in market creation by strictly addressing a large number of customers sustainable products and services
 Can not take traditional marketing strategies to promote
 company kii khapat karne ke liye utpaada vikaas se aapurti shrinkhalaa bhar main vipanan ranneeti yah sthirataa main shaamil karnaa chahie
 Social marketing is different from commercial marketing
 vahaan paanch mahatvapurn kshetron main jahaan saamaajik vipanan bahut baari kendrit kar rahe hai or ve yah hai; saamudayik bhagidaari, swasthya sanvardhan, paryaavaran sangrakshan, vittiya acchhee tarah se kiya ja rahaa he or chot kii rokthaam
 Effective social marketing is based on a community and practical approach; This greatly changes operative behavior
 yah drushtikon paanch charnon, ve he; Marketing has now changed itself to become a sustainability feature in almost all marketing practices
 ab yah kuch had tak anivaary companiyaan apane ranneetik vipanan prathaon or vipanan mishran ke sabhi main sthirataa par vichaar karne ke liye ho rahi he
 This is from a very specific and objective function to integrate sustainability into marketing strategy and at the same time it is an easy task because marketing strategies are evolving by taking into account the needs and wants of customers or not 
 ek sthaayee vipanan ranneeti viksit karnaa ek aasaan kaam nahin he, kyonki vahaan kuch mudden or chunautiyaan hai jinhen dhyaan se or budhimaani se kii jane vaali ranneetiyon ke saath par jane se pehle nipta janaa chahie
 This is not only a good thing of sustainable marketing, not only competitive advantage, but also gives rise to innovation and cost reduction

 However, the dissemination of sustainability-driven messages and behaviors has been achieved through successful, in particular, rarely such participation to date

Although still quite low, there is an increasing, crowd sourcing campaign, where social and environmental entrepreneurship is promoted and brands are listed through competitions and other types of acceleration

 Another way to approach this type of sustainability marketing strategy is through designing entirely new business models that minimize the effects of consumption

 Surprisingly, despite holding high government posts and political posts for almost decades, Ghulam was unable to do anything for a backward region like Isaac Khan Banun

 aapaki pramukh bal sahitya kritiyaan hai- ] pramukh bal kavitaayen hai- sampark sutara- Jalal Uddin Mohammad Akbar was the third ruler of the Mughal dynasty of the Timurid lineage
 akbar ko akbar-i-aazam, shahenshaah akbar, mahabali shahenshaah ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Emperor Akbar was the grandson of Zaheeruddin Muhammad Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, and the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and Hamida Bano
 babar kaa vansh taimur or mongol netaa changez khan se sambandhit tha arthath uske vanshaj taimur langs ke khandaan se the or matrupaksh kaa sambandh changez khan se tha
 By the end of Akbar's rule in 1605, the Mughal Empire consisted mostly of northern and central India and was one of the most powerful empires of the time
 baadshahon main akbar hi ek aisa badshaah tha, jise hindu muslim donon virgon kaa baraabar pyaar or sammaan mila
 He established a religion called din-i-ilahi to reduce the distance between hindu-muslim sects
 uskaa darbar sabake liye har samay khulaa rahata tha
 In his court, there were more Hindu chieftains than Muslim chieftains
 akbar ne hinduon par lagane vaala jazia hi nahin samaapt kiya, balki aise anek kaary kiye jinke kaaran hindu or muslim donon uske prashansak bane
 Akbar was sitting on the throne of Delhi after the death of his father Naseeruddin Muhammad Humayun at the age of just thirteen
 apane shashan kaal main usne shaktishaalee pashtun vanshaj shershah suri ke akraman bilkul band karvaa diye the, saath hi panipat ke dwitiya yuddh main navghoshit hindu raja hemu ko parajeet kiya tha
 It took Akbar two decades to form his empire and bring all the regions of northern and central India into unilateral authority
 uskaa prabhaav lagbhag puure bhartiya upmahadweep par tha or is kshetra ke ek bade bhubhag par samraat ke rup main usne shashan kiya
 As emperor, Akbar made diplomatic relations with powerful and majority Hindu Rajput kings and also married them
 akbar ke shashan kaa prabhaav desh kii kala evam samskruti par bhi padaa
 He showed a lot of interest in fine arts such as painting and the walls of his palace were filled with beautiful paintings and samples
 mughal chitrakaari kaa vikaas karne ke saath saath hi usne europea style kaa bhi swaagat kiya
 He was also interested in literature and had got many Sanskrit manuscripts and texts translated into Persian and Persian texts into Sanskrit and Hindi
 anek farsi samskruti se jude chitron ko apane darbar kii deevaaron par bhi banwaaya
 During his early rule, Akbar did not have tolerance towards Hindus, but over time he changed himself and showed great interest in other religions including Hindus
 usne hindu rajput rajkumariyon se vaivaahik sambandh bhi banaaye
 There were many Hindu courtiers, military officers and feudatories in Akbar's court
 usne dharmik charchaaon va vaad-vivaad kaaryakramon kii anokhi shrunkhlaa aarambh kii thi, jisamen muslim aalim logon kii jain, sikh, hindu, charvak, naastik, yahudee, portugali evam catholic isai dharmashastriyon se charchaaen hua karti thim
 He had respect for these religious leaders, which did not affect his personal religious feelings at all
 usne aage chalakar ek naye dharm deen-e-ilaahi kii bhi sthapana kii, jisamen vishwa ke sabhi pradhan dharmon kii nitiyon va shikshaaon kaa samavesh tha
 Unfortunately, this religion ended with the death of Akbar
 itane bade samraat kii mrityu hone par uski antyeshti bina kisi sanskaar ke jaldi hi kar di gayi
 Traditionally, a passage was made by breaking the wall in the fort and his body was quietly buried in the tomb of Sikandra
 akbar kaa janm poornima ke din hua tha isliye unka naam badaruddin mohammad akbar rakhaa gaya tha
 Badr means Full Moon and Akbar was derived from his maternal grandfather Sheikh Ali Akbar Jami
 kaha jaataa he ki kabul par vijay milane ke baad unke pita humayun ne buree nazar se bachane ke liye akbar kii janm tithi evam naam badal die the
 It is also legend that the people of India honored him with the name Akbar for his successful and efficient governance
 arabi bhashaa me akbar shabd kaa arth "mahaan" yaa bada hota he
 Akbar was born on November 23, 1542 in Umerkot, Sindh, the palace of the Rajput ruler Rana Amarsal
 yahaan badshaah humayu apni haal kii vivaahita begum hamida bano begum ke saath sharan liye hue the
 Humayun named this son once in a dream, according to which he was named Jalaluddin Mohammad
 babar kaa vansh taimur or mongol netaa changez khan se tha yani uske vanshaj taimur langs ke khandaan se the or matrupaksh kaa sambandh changez khan se tha
 Thus Akbar's arteries were a mixture of the blood of two of Asia's most famous races, the Turks and the Mongols
 humayun ko pashtun netaa shershah suri ke kaaran faras main agyatavaas bitaana pad rahaa tha
 But he did not take Akbar with him, but left him in Mukundpur, a village in the kingdom of Rewa
 akbar kii vahaan ke rajkumaar ram singh pratham se, jo aage chalakar rivaan kaa raja bana, ke sang gahari mitrataa ho gayi thi
 They grew up together and grew and remained lifelong friends
 kalantar main akbar safaavi samrajya main apane ek chachaa mirza askari ke yahaan rahane laga
 He first stayed in Kandahar for a few days and then in Kabul from 1545
 humayun kii apane chote bhaaiyon se baraabar thani hi rahi isaliye chachaa logon ke yahan akbar kii sthiti bandi se kuch hi acchhee thi
 However, all were well with him and probably loved affectionately too much
 kintu akbar pard likh nahin sakaa vah keval sainya shiksha le sakaa
 He spent a lot of time in games, races and duality, wrestling, etc
, and he was not interested in education
 jab tak akbar aath varsh kaa hua, janm se lekar ab tak uske sabhi varsh baari asthirataa main nikle the jiske kaaran uski shiksha-diksha kaa sahi prabandh nahin ho paaya tha
 Now Humayun's attention also went towards this
 lagbhag navambar, +--9-9 main usne akbar kii shiksha prarambh karne ke liye kabul main ek aayojan kiya
 But on the occasion, Akbar lost the ceremony on the second day
 mullah jaada mullah asamuddin abrahim ko akbar kaa shikshak niyukt kiya gaya
 But Mulla Asmuddin proved incompetent
 tab yah kaary pehle moulana bamjid ko saunpa gaya, magar jab unhen bhi safalataa nahin mili to moulana abdul kaadir ko yah kaam saunpa gaya
 But none of the teachers succeeded in educating Akbar
 asal main, padhane-likhane main akbar kii ruchi nahin thi, uski ruchi kabutar baaji, ghudsawaari or kute paalane main adhik thi
 But he was always interested in learning
 kaha jaataa he, ki jab vah sone jaataa tha, ek vyakti use kuch pard kar sunaata rahta tha
 Over time, Akbar emerged as a mature and discerning ruler with a keen interest in art, architecture, music and literature
 shershah suri ke putr islam shah ke uttaradhikaar ke vivaadon se utpann araajaktaa kaa laabh uthaa kar humayun ne 1555 main dilli par punah adhikaar kar liya
 In this, a good part of his army was the Persian ally Tahmasp I
 iske kuch maah baad hi 48 varsh kii aayu main hi humayun kaa aakasmik nidhan apane pustkaalay kii seedhi se baari nashe kii halaat main girane ke kaaran ho gaya
 Then Akbar's mentor Bairam Khan kept this death hidden for some time in the interest of the empire and prepared Akbar for succession
 14 farvari, 1556 ko akbar kaa rajtilak hua
 All this happened during the ongoing war with Sikander Shah Suri for the return of authority on the throne of Delhi from the Mughal Empire
 13 varshiya akbar kaa kalnaur, punjab main sunahare vastra tathaa ek gahare rang kii pagadi main ek navnirmit manch par rajtilak hua
 This platform remains even today
 use farsi bhashaa main samraat ke liye shabd shahenshaah se pukaara gaya
 Until adulthood, his kingdom remained under the protection of Bairam Khan
 khoye hue rajya ko punah praapt karne ke liye akbar ke pita humayun ke anwarat praytn antat safal hue or vah san 1555 main hindustan pahunch sakaa kintu agle hi varsh san 1556 main rajdhani dilli main uski mrityu ho gai or gurdaspur ke kalnaur naamak sthaan par 14 varsh kii aayu main akbar kaa rajtilak hua
 Bairam Khan, the patron of Akbar, was appointed whose influence remained on him till 1560
 tatkaaleen mughal rajya keval kabul se dilli tak hi failaa hua tha
 Along with this, many problems were also raised
 1563 main shamsuddin atka khan kii hatya par ubhara jan aakrosh, 1564-65 ke bich uzbek vidroh or 1566-67 main mirza bhaaiyon kaa vidroh bhi tha, kintu akbar ne badi kushalta se in samasyaon ko hal kar liya
 He increased his feudal power through his creativity
 isi bich 1566 main maham anka naamak uski dhai ke banawaaye madrase se shahar lautate hue akbar par tir se ek jaanaleva hamalaa hua, jise akbar ne apni furti se bachaa liya, haalanki uski baanh main gaharaa ghaav hua
 After this incident there was some change in Akbar's Prashan style under which he took full reins of governance
 iske fouran baad hi hemu ke netritv main afgaan sena punah sangathit hokar uske sammukh chunauti banakar khadi thi
 In the early period of his rule, Akbar understood that he would not be able to rule peacefully without ending the Suri dynasty
 isliye vah suri vansh ke sabase shaktishaalee shaasha sikandar shah suri par akraman karne punjab chal padaa
 He handed over the rule of Delhi to Mughal commander Tardi Bag Khan
 sikandar shah suri akbar ke liye bahut bada pratirodh sabit nahi hua
 In some regions, his army used to retreat even before Akbar arrived
 akbar kii anupasthiti me hemu vikramaditya ne dilli or agra par akraman kar vijay praapt kii
 On 6 October 1556 Hemu declared himself the Maharaja of India
 isi ke saath dilli me hindu rajya kii punah sthapana hui
 When Akbar got the news of Delhi's defeat, he immediately made an intention to travel to Delhi after consulting Bairam Khan
 akbar ke salaahkaaro ne use kabul kii sharan main jane kii salaah di
 There was a war in Panipat between Akbar and Hemu's army
 yah yuddh panipat kaa dwitiya yuddh ke naam se prasiddh he
 Despite being small in number, Akbar won in this war
 is vijay se akbar ko 1500 hathi mili jo manakot ke hamale main sikandar shah suri ke viruddh kaam aae
 Sikandar Shah Suri surrendered and Akbar surrendered him
 dilli par punah adhikaar jamaane ke baad akbar ne apane rajya kaa vistaar karnaa shuru kiya or malwa ko 1562 main, gujarat ko 1572 main, bengal ko 1574 main, kabul ko 1581 main, kashmir ko 1586 main or khandesh ko 1601 main mogul samrajya ke adheen kar liya
 Akbar appointed one governor each in these states
 akbar yah nahi chahta tha kii mogul samrajya kaa kendra dilli jaise duurastha shahar main ho; isliye usne yah nirnay liya kii mogul rajdhani ko fatehpur sikri le jaaya jaae jo samrajya ke madhya main thi
 Shortly after, Akbar had to be removed from the capital Fatehpur Sikri
 kaha jaataa he ki pani kii kami iskaa pramukh kaaran tha
 After Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar created a mobile court that used to roam across the empire, thus it was possible to pay proper attention to all the corners of the empire
 san 1585 main uttar pashchimi rajya ke sucharu raaj paalan ke liye akbar ne lahore ko rajdhani banaaya
 Before his death, Akbar made Agra the capital back in 1599 and ruled from there till the end
 san 1560 main akbar ne swayan satta sambhaal lee or apane sangrakshak bairam khan ko nikaal baahar kiya
 Now Akbar had power in his hands but also had many difficulties
 jaise - shamsuddin atka khan kii hatya par ubhara jan aakrosh, uzbek vidroh or mirza bhaaiyon kaa vidroh kintu akbar ne badi kushalta se in samasyaon ko hal kar liya
 He increased his feudal power through his creativity
 san 1562 main amer ke shaasha se usne samjhauta kiya - is prakaar rajput raja bhi uski ore ho gayi
 Similarly, he also gave big help to those coming from Iran
 bhartiya musalamaanon ko bhi usne apane kushal vyavhaar se apni ore kar liya
 He gave a unique introduction to religious tolerance - the Jiziya was removed by putting Hindu places of pilgrimage
 isse puure rajyavasiyon ko anubhav ho gaya ki vah ek parivartit niti apnaane main sakasham he
 In addition, he also forcibly stopped the conversion of prisoners of war
 akbar ne apane shasankaal main taanben, chaandi evam sone kii mudraayen prachlit kii
 There was beautiful Islamic printing on the back of these postures
 akbar ne apane kaal kii mudraao main kai badlaav kiye
 He introduced an open mint system in which if any person was able to pay the mint fee, he could change the currency of Akbar from another currency or gold
 akbar chahta tha ki uske puure samrajya main samaan mudra chale
 After the Second War of Panipat, Akbar regained Delhi by killing Hemu
 iske baad usne apane rajya kaa vistaar karnaa shuru kiya or malwa ko 1562 main, gujarat ko 1572 main, bengal ko 1574 main, kabul ko 1581 main, kashmir ko 1586 main or khandesh ko 1601 main mogul samrajya ke adheen kar liya
 Akbar appointed one governor each to handle the administration in these states
 use raaj sanbhaalane ke liye dilli kai sthanon se dur laga or ye prathit hua ki isse prashasan main samasya aa sakati he, atah usne nirnay liya kii mogul rajdhani ko agra ke nikat fatehpur sikri le jaaya jaae jo samrajya ke lagbhag madhya main thi
 Akbar built a new city on an old settled village Sikri which was named Fatehabad or Fatehpur in the joy of his victory i
e
 Fatah
 jaldi hi ise puure vartmaan naam fatehpur sikri se bulaayaa jane laga
 Most of the constructions here are of the 14 years in which Akbar resided here
 shahar main shahi udyaan, aaraamgahen, saamanton va darbariyon ke liye awaas tathaa bacchon ke liye madrase banawaaye gaye
 According to Blair and Bloom, buildings within the city are of two major types - service buildings, such as caravanseri, mint, factories, large markets where vertical constructions of the southwest / north east axis are built and the second royal section, which includes India's largest There are collective mosques, as well as residential and administrative buildings called Daulatkhana
 ye pahari se kuch kone par sthit hai tathaa kibala ke saath ek kone banaati hai
 But this decision was not proved right and after some time Akbar had to be removed from the capital Fatehpur Sikri
 iske peeche pani kii kami pramukh kaaran tha
 After Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar created a mobile court that roamed throughout the empire and thus made it possible to pay proper attention to all the places of the empire
 baad main usne san 1585 main uttar pashchimi bhaag ke liye lahore ko rajdhani banaaya
 Before death, Akbar made the capital back to Agra in 1599 and ruled from there till the end
 agra shahar kaa nayaa naam diya gaya akbarabad jo samrajya kii sabase bada shahar bana
 The main part of the city was situated on the western bank of river Yamuna
 yahaan barsaat ke pani kii nikasi kii acchhee naaliyaan-naalon se paripurna vayavastha banaayi gai
 a new sandstone wall was built in 1565 by breaking the old boundary wall of the mortar-built city built by the Lodhi Empire
 angrez itihaaskaar yugal blair evam bloom ke anusaar is laal diwaar ke kaaran hi iskaa naam laal kila padaa
 He further writes that this fort was made somewhat semicircular on the map of the previous fort
 shahar kii ore se ise ek dohari suraksha diwaar ghere he, jiske baahar gahari khai bani he
 This double wall has Delhi Gate in the north and Amar Singh Gate in the south 
 ye donon dwaar apane dhanushakar mehrab-rupi aalon va burjon tathaa laal va safed sangmarmar par neeli glemud tilon dwaara alankaran se hi pahachaane jate hai
 The present fort is built by Shah Jahan, grandson of Akbar
 isamen dakshini ore jahangiri mahal or akbar mahal hai
 Raj Bharmal, the Kachhwaha Rajput of Amber, entered Akbar's court shortly after taking over his kingdom
 inhone apni rajkumaari harkhaa bai kaa vivaah akbar se karwaanaa sweekaar kiya
 Jodha Bai shehzade Salim ke janm ke pashchaat called Maryam-uz-zamani
 uski mrityu 1623 main hui thi
 a mosque was built in Lahore in his honor by his son Jahangir
 bhaarmal ko akbar ke darbar main ooncha sthaan mila tha or uske baad uske putr bhagwant das or pautra maansingh bhi darbar ke oonche samant bane rahe
 The episodes of Hindu princesses getting married to Muslim kings took place long before Akbar, but after most marriages the two families did not have good relations and neither did the princesses ever return home
 haalanki akbar ne is maamle ko pichley prakarnon se alag rup diya, jahaan un raniyon ke bhaaiyon yaa pitaaon ko putriyon yaa bahanon ke vivahoparaant akbar ke muslim sasuraal waalon jaisaa hi sammaan mila karata tha, sivaay unke sang khaanaa khaane or prarthana karne ke
 Those Rajputs found good places in Akbar's court
 sabhi ne unhen vaise hi apanaaya tha sivaay kuch roodhiwaadee pariwaron ko chhodkar, jinhone ise apmaan ke rup main dekha tha
 Other Rajpur princely states also formed marital relations with Akbar, but there was no condition for marriage
 do pramukh rajput vansh, mewarh ke shishodiya or ranthambor ke hadha vansh in sambandhon se sadaa hi hatate rahe
 Raja Mansingh, a well-known courtier of Akbar, also took an affidavit from Akbar to Surjan Hodha, a Hadha king, whom Surjan Singh accepted on the condition that he would not marry any of his daughters with Akbar
 antatah koi vaivaahik sambandh nahin hue kintu surjan ko garh-katang kaa adhibhaar saunp kar sammanit kiya gaya
 Many other Rajput feudals also did not like to give daughters of their kings to the Mughals in the name of marriage
 garh sivaan ke rathore kalyandas ne motaa raja raav udaisingh or jahangir ko maarane kii dhamkee bhi di thi, kyonki udaisingh ne apni putree jodhabai kaa vivaah akbar ke putr jahangir se karne kaa nishchay kiya tha
 Akbar, having this knowledge, sent the royal forces to attack Kalyanadasa
 kalyandas us sena ke sang yuddh main kaam aayaa or uski striyon ne johar kar liya
 The political impact of these relations was significant
 haalanki kuch rajput striyon ne akbar ke haram main pravesh lene par islam sweekaar kiya, phir bhi unhen purna dharmik swatantraaa thi, saath hi unke sage-sambandhiyon ko jo hindu hi the; darbar main ucch-sthaan bhi mili the
 Through them, the sound of the masses reached Akbar's court
 darbar ke hindu or muslim darbariyon ke bich sampark badhane se aapasi vichaaron kaa aadan-pradaan hua or donon dharmon main sambhaav kii pragati hui
 This led to the confluence of the two bloods in the next generation, which also promoted harmony between the two sects
 parinamswaroop rajput mughalon ke sarvaadhik shaktishaalee sahaayak bane, rajput sainyadhikariyon ne mughal sena main rahakar anek yuddh kiye tathaa jite
 Among them was the 1572 campaign of Gujarat
 akbar kii dharmik sahishnutaa kii niti ne shahi prashasan main sabhi ke liye naukariyon or rojgaar ke avasar khol diye the
 Due to this, the administration became stronger
 tatkaaleen samaaj main veshyavriti ko samraat kaa sangrakshan pradaan tha
 He had a huge harem in which there were many women
 inamen adhikansh striyon ko balpurvak apahrit karvaa kar vahaan rakhaa hua tha
 Sati was also in full swing at that time
 tab kaha jaataa he ki akbar ke kuch log jis sundar stri ko sati hote dekhte the, balpurvak jaakar sati hone se roak dete va use samraat kii ajna bataate tathaa us stri ko haram main daal diya jaataa tha
 However, the court historians have said this case in some way that the King Salamat thus opposed the practice of Sati and gave protection to those Abla women
 apni jeevani main akbar ne swayan likhaa he– yadi mujhe pehle hi yah budhimatta jaagrit ho jaati to main apni sultanate kii kisi bhi stri kaa apharan kar apane haram main nahin laata
 It is clear from this that he used to kidnap the beauties
 iske alaava apharan na karwaane vaali baat kii nirarthakta bhi is tathy se gyaat hoti he ki na to akbar ke samay main or na hi uske utraadhikario ke samay main haram band hui thi
 According to Ain Akbari, Abdul Qadir Badauni says that wagons, nobles, wives of courtiers or other women whenever they wish to appear in the service of the emperor have to first give notice of their wish and wait for an answer; Those who are considered eligible are allowed to enter the harem
 akbar apni praja ko baadhya kiya karata tha kii vah apane ghar kii striyon kaa nagn pradarshan samuhik rup se yojit kare jise akbar ne khudaaroj naam diya hua tha
 Akbar's only purpose behind this celebration was to choose beauties for his harem
 
 Rani Durgavati of Gondwana also had Akbar's vision
 usne rani ko praapt karne ke liye uske rajya par akraman kar diya
 During the war, Veerangana realized that there was an attempt to capture him rather than kill him, so he committed suicide there
 tab akbar ne uski bahan or putrabadhu ko balpurvak apane haram main daal diya
 Akbar also practiced the practice that his defeated enemies send selected women from his family and hostess to his harem
 1556 main akbar ke gaddi lene ke samay, portugaliyon ne mahadweep ke pashchimi tat par bahut se durg va nirmaaniyan laga lee thim or bade str par us kshetra main nauvahan or sagariya vyapaar niyantrit karne lage the
 Due to this colonialism, all other merchant institutions were taught to remain impatient with the terms of the Portuguese, to which the rulers and traders of that time had begun to object
 mughal samrajya ne akbar ke rajtilak ke baad pehla nishaanaa gujarat ko banaaya or sagar tat par pratham vijay paayi 1572 main, kintu portugaliyon kii shakti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pehle kuch varshon tak unase maatr faras kii khadi kshetra main yatra karne hetu kartaaz naamak paas liye jate rahe
 At the time of the acquisition of Surat in 1572, the Mughals and the Portuguese first met and the Portuguese perceived the real power of the Mughals and consequently thought it appropriate to act on policy rather than war, and the Portuguese governor, upon Akbar's instructions, gave him a treaty by an ambassador
 Sent proposal akbar ne us kshetra se apane haram ke va anya muslim logon dwaara makka ko haj kii yatra ko surakshit karne kii drushti se prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 In 1573, Akbar issued a decree to the administrative officials of Gujarat, ordering the Portuguese to be allowed to live peacefully in nearby Daman
 iske badale main portugaliyon ne akbar ke parivaar ke liye haj ko jane hetu paas jari kiye the
 In 1576, Akbar sent a large group of Hajis, including several members of his harem, under the leadership of Yahya Saleh to Haj
 ye jattha do poton main surat se jeddah bandargah par 1577 main pahunchaa or makka or madina ko agrasar hua
 Between 1577 and 1580, four more caravans left for Hajj, with which there were gifts for the people of Mecca and Medina and Sadak for the poor
 ye yatri samaaj ke aarthik rup se nichle varg ke the or inke jane se un shaharon par aarthik bhaar badha
 Then the Ottoman administration requested them to return home, on which the women of the harem were not ready
 kaaphi vivaad ke baad unhen vivash hokar lautnaa padhaa
 The Governor of Aden was enraged at the large number of travelers who arrived in 1580 and insulted the Mughals as much as possible while returning
 in prakarnon ke kaaran akbar ko hajiyon kii yatraaon par roak lagaani padi
 After 1584 Akbar planned to ascend the port of Aden, subordinate to the Kingdom of Yemen, with the help of the Portuguese
 portugaliyon se is bare main yojana banane hetu ek mughal doot goa main aktubar 1584 se sthaayee rup se tainaat kiya gaya
 In 1587 a Portuguese contingent also invaded Yemen but suffered defeat by the Ottoman navy
 iske baad mughal-portugali gathbandhan ko bhi dhakka pahunchaa kyonki mughal jagiradaaron dwaara janzira main portugaliyon par lagaataar dabaav daalaa ja rahaa tha
 Akbar was a Muslim, but he also had respect for other religions and sects
 jaise-jaise akbar kii aayu badati gai vaise-vaise uski dharm ke prati ruchi badhane lagi
 He is particularly known for his fondness for Hinduism
 usne apane purvajo se vipareet kai hindu rajkumariyon se shaadi kii
 Apart from this, Akbar also held Hindus in various princely positions in his state, which was not done by any former Muslim ruler
 vah yah jaan gaya tha ki bharat main lambe samay tak raaj karne ke liye use yahan ke mul nivaasiyon ko uchit evam barabari kaa sthaan dena chaiye
 The Jiziya on Hindus was removed by Akbar in 1562, but had to be withdrawn in 1575 due to opposition from Muslim leaders, although he later withdrew policyfully
 jazia kar garib hinduon ko garibi se vivash hokar islam kii sharan lene ke liye lagaaya jaataa tha
 It was not imposed on Muslim people
 is kar ke kaaran bahut si garib hindu jansankhya par boj padataa tha, jisase vivash ho kar ve islam kabool kar liya karte the
 Firoz Shah Tughlaq has described how Islam was spread by Jizya
 akbar dwaara jazia or hindu tirthon par lage kar hataane ke samayik nirnyon kaa hinduon par kuch khaas prabhaav nahin padaa, kyonki isse unhen kuch khaas laabh nahin hua, kyonki ye kuch antaraal baad waapas laga die gaye
 Akbar had converted many Hindus to Islam against his will, in addition to this, he also converted the names of many Hindu pilgrimage places, such as Prayag to Allahabad in 1583
 akbar ke shasankaal main hi uske ek sipahasaalar hossain khan tukriya ne hinduon ko balpurvak bhedbhaav darshak bille unke kandhon or baahon par lagane ko vivash kiya tha
 There is a legend about the Jwalamukhi temple
 yah 1542 se 1605 ke madhya kaa hi hoga tabhi akbar dilli kaa raja tha
 The meditated mother was the ultimate devotee of Jotawali
 ek baar devi ke darshan ke liye vah apane gaanvvaasiyo ke saath jwalaji ke liye niklaa
 When his convoy passed through Delhi, the Mughal Emperor Akbar's soldiers stopped him and presented him in the court of King Akbar
 akbar ne jab dhyanu se poocha ki vah apane gaanvvaasiyon ke saath kahaan ja rahaa he to uttar main dhyanu ne kaha vah jotavaali ke darshano ke liye ja rahe he
 Akbar said what strength does your mother have? And what can she do? Then Dhyanu said that she is going to protect the whole world
 aisa koi bhi kaary nahi he jo vah nahin kar sakati he
 Akbar cut the head of the horse of Dhyanu and said that if your mother has power, then add the head of the horse and make it alive
 yah vachan sunakar dhyanu devi kii stuti karne laga or apana sir kaat kar mata ko bhet ke rup main pradaan kiya
 The head of the horse was joined by the power of mother
 is prakaar akbar ko devi kii shakti kaa ehsaas hua
 Emperor Akbar also offered a gold umbrella in the temple of the goddess
 kintu uske man me abhimaan ho gaya ki wo sone kaa chhatra chadhaane laayaa he, to mata ne uske haath se chhatra ko girava diya or use ek ajeeb dhaatu kaa bana diya jo aaj tak ek rahasy he
 This canopy is still present in the temple
 itihaaskaar dasharath sharma bataate hai, ki ham akbar ko uske darbar ke itihaas or varnanon jaise akbarnama, aadi ke anusaar mahaan kehete hai
 If one looks at other notable works, such as Dalpat Vilas, then it will become clear how abusive Akbar used to treat his Hindu feudatories
 akbar ke navratna raja maansingh dwaara vishwanath mandir ke nirmaan ko akbar kii anumati ke baad kiye jane ke kaaran hinduon ne us mandir main jane kaa bahishkaar kar diya
 The reason was clear, that Raja Mansingh's family had marital relations with Akbar
 akbar ke hindu samant uski anumati ke bagaiyr mandir nirmaan tak nahin kara sakate the
 When King Mansingh started construction of a temple in Bengal without permission, Akbar stopped it when he came to know and in 1595 ordered him to convert it into a mosque
 akbar ke liye aakrosh kii had ek ghatana se pataa chalati he
 Raja Ram, a leader of Hindu peasants, attempted to rob Akbar's tomb, Sikandra, Agra, which was thwarted by the local faujdar, Mir Abul Fazal
 iske kuch hi samay baad 1688 main raja ram sikandra main dobaaraa prakat hua or shysta khan ke aane main vilamb kaa phayda uthaate hue, usne makbare par dobaaraa send lagaai or bahut se bahumoolya saamaan, jaise sone, chaandi, bahumoolya kaaleen, chiraag, ityadi lut liye, tathaa jo le ja nahin sakaa, unhen barbaad kar gaya
 King Rama and his men dug out and burnt the asbestos of Akbar, which was a subject of utter humiliation for the Muslims
 baad ke varshon main akbar ko anya dharmon ke prati bhi aakarshan hua
 Akbar's attachment to Hinduism was not only to solidify the Mughal Empire, but he had a personal interest in Hinduism
 hindu dharm ke alaava akbar ko shiya islam evam isai dharm main bhi ruchi thi
 He once called a Portuguese evangelist from Goa to learn the fundamental principles of Christianity
 akbar ne darbar main ek vishesh jagah banavaai thi jise ibaadat-khaanaa kaha jaataa tha, jahaan vah vibhinn dharmaguruon evam prachaarkon se dharmik charchaaen kiya karata tha
 His exploration of other religions was unbearable for some Muslim fundamentalists
 unhe lagane laga tha ki akbar apane dharm se bhatak rahaa he
 There was some truth in these things as well, Akbar sometimes took some decisions out of orthodox Islam, even in 1582 he started a new sect called din-i-ilahi i
e
 the religion of God
 deen-e-ilaahi naam se akbar ne 1582 main ek nayaa dharm banaaya jisamen sabhi dharmo ke mul tatwon ko daalaa, isame pramukhtah hindu evam islam dharm the
 Apart from these, the basic ideas of Parsi, Jain and Christianity were also included
 haalanki is dharm ke prachaar ke liye usne kuch adhik udyog nahin kiye keval apane vishwast logo ko hi isame sammilit kiya
 It is said that apart from Akbar, only King Birbal was a follower till his death
 dabestan-e-majahab ke anusaar akbar ke pashchaat keval 19 logo ne is dharm ko apanaaya
 Later, Akbar composed a new almanac in which he started a divine era which began on the day of his coronation
 usne tatkaaleen sikkon ke peeche ‘‘allaah-o-akbar’’ likhvaya jo anekaarthi shabd tha
 Akbar literally means "great" and the words "allah-o-akbar" could have two meanings "allah is great" or "akbar is Allah"
 deen-e-ilaahi sahi mino main dharm na hokar ek aachaar samhita ke samaan tha
 In this, indulgence, pride, slander or blaming were forbidden and were called sins
 dayaa, vichaarsheelataa or sanyam iske aadhaar stambh the
 It has been argued that din-i-ilahi's doctrine of having a new religion is a misconception, which was later born out of the mistranslation of Abul Fazl's works by British historians
 haalanki, yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki sulah-e-kul kii niti, jisamen deen-i-ilaihi kaa saar tha, akbar ne keval dharmik uddeshyon ke liye nahin balki saamaanya shahi prashasnic niti kaa ek bhaag ke rup main apanaaya tha
 This formed the basis of Akbar's policy of religious sympathy
 1605 main akbar kii maut ke samay unke muslim vishyon main asantosh kaa koi sanket nahin tha, or abdul haq jaise ek dharamshastri kii dharna thi ki nikat sambandh bane rahe
 Despite being illiterate, Akbar had a special love for artists and intellectuals
 uske isi prem ke kaaran akbar ke darbar main nau ati gunwan darbari the jinhen akbar ke navratna ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Akbar's personality has been much talked about
 isliye bhartiya sahitya evam cinema ne akbar se prerit kai paatr rache gaye hai
 The University of Copenhagen is a research institute in Denmark

 It is located close to them, connected to the main senses, eye, nose, tongue and ear
 mastishk sabhi rishadhari praaniyon main hota he parantu amerudandi praaniyon main yah kendriya mastishk yaa swatantra ganglia ke rup main hota he
 In some organisms such as Nidaria and starfish, it is not concentrated, but it is spread throughout the body, whereas some animals like sponges do not have brain
 ucch shrenee ke praaniyon jaise maanav main mastishk atyant jatil hote hai
 The human brain consists of about 1 billion nerve cells, each of which establishes more than 10,000 conjuncts from other nerve cells
 mastishk sabase jatil ang he
 The functions of various organs of the body are controlled and regulated by the brain
 atah mastishk ko sharir kaa maalik ang kehete hai
 Its main function is to control and regulate knowledge, intelligence, reasoning, memory, thought decision, personality etc

 In fact, children are born as a separate personality and as their brain develops, so does their personality
 mastishk, khopadi main sthit he
 It is a place of consciousness and memory

 The main centers for sending impulses by neurotransmitter to regulate muscle contraction and to regulate those actions are in the brain, although these actions take place from different centers located in the spinal cord
 anubhav se praapt hue gyaan ko sagrah karne, vichaarne tathaa vichaar karke nishkarsh nikaalane kaa kaam bhi isi ang kaa he
 The major part of the brain is located in the cerebral cranium
 inke peeche ke bhaag ke nache kii ore anumastishk ke do chote chote golargh jude hue dikhaai dete hai
 On the front side of it is the part, which is called the midbrain or middle sternum
 isse neeche ko jaataa hua merushirsh, yaa medula aublangeta, kehete he
 The cerebrum and cerebellum are covered with membranes, which are called meninges
 ye teen hai: drudh tanika, jaali tanika or mridu tanika
 The most outwardly firm is the meninges
 isamen ve badi badi shirayen rahati hai, jinke dwaara rakt lautataa he
 Due to the fracture of the palatine, or injury due to injury, blood comes out from the veins located in it and accumulates in the brain, due to which the cells of the brain become dysfunctional and paralysis of the organs
 is tanika se ek falak nikalakar donon golardho ke bich main bhi jaataa he
 These plates where they divide into two levels and form those wide tubes, from which the returning blood and some cerebrospinal tumors also return
 iske donon golargho kaa anya bhaagon kii apeksha bahut bada hona manushya ke mastishk kii visheshta he
 Both hemispheres extend from the frontal frontal to the right and to the left end of the cranial end

 There is a deep moat in the middle of the hemisphere, at the bottom of which the two hemispheres are joined by a broad lace like structure called a coronator
 golardho kaa rang upar se ghooser dikhaai detaa he
 How many deep fissures remain in the outer surface of the hemisphere, where the object of the outer surface of the brain penetrates into it
 aisa prathit hota he, maano prishth par kisi vastu kii tah ko failaakar samet diya gaya he, jisase usamen silawatein pad gai hai
 Due to this, many big small trenches are formed on the surface of the brain, which are called sarkha
 parikhaaon ke bich dhoosar mastishk prishth ke mude hue chakranshavatad bhaag karnak kehalaate hai, kyonki ve karnashushkali ke samaan mude hue se hai
 Big and deep grooves are called fissures and separate specific areas of the brain

 Here, there is a lot of tactile reason behind Rolando's fissure
 lalatkhand anya sab jantuon kii apeksha manushya main badha hua he, jiske agrim bhaag kaa vishesh vikaas hua he
 This part is connected to all the motors and impulses by the connective sutras, especially those centers near the conductor region, which are related to eye movements

 Both hemispheres have this cavity, which is called the ventricle
 ye golardho ke agrim bhaag lalatkhand se peeche paschkhand tak vistrut hai
 Inside them, there is a subtle art overlaid on the brain, which is called inner

 abhivyanjanawad ke pravartak benedetto kroche multah aatmavaadi darshanik hai
 Their aim was to establish the inner power of the soul in literature
 inase purv kant ne man tathaa bahya jagat ke tadatmya or samanvay kaa pratipaadan karte hue drishy jagat kii upeksha kii or higel ne kant kii manyata sweekaar karte hue drishy jagat ko bhi mahatva pradaan kiya
 In contrast, Croche only gave importance to the mental process
 unki drushti main bahya upkaran gaun saadhan maatr hai
 Kroche's expressionism is an attempt to discover the basic elements of art
 kala kaa vaastavik tatva kya he athwa uski aatma kya he? is vishay main kroche ne apana gambheer vivechan prastut kiya he, jo sookshm bhi he
 Self-essence is distinguished in all the beauty of Croche
 yah aatm-tatva kalakaar kii chetana he
 This self-element has been termed by Crouche as an internal expression, which makes two main reactions in this world
 kroche ke anusaar maansik yaa gyaan kii kriyaaon ke do bhed hai- saiddhanthik yaa maansik or vyaavhaarik
 These are called by Croche respectively worldly knowledge and worldly actions
 kalakaar kii maansik shakti yaa uskaa sansaarik bodh do prakaar se vyakt hota he
 One type is instinctive, which is emotional
 isamen tark kaa aashray nahin liya jaataa, apitu hriday kii sahaj gati ko ankit karne kaa prayaas rahata he
 This is what Croche has called spontaneous cognition
 isi sahjanubhuti se kala kaa janm hota he
 The second type of mental perception is intelligence-oriented
 isamen vyakti vichaar yaa tark dwaara jagat ke rahasyon ko samajhataa he or unke vishay main apni dharna banaata he
 This is what Crouche called logic
 vyaavhaarik kriya paksh ke bhi do prakaar hai- ek aarthik or doosraa naitik 
 Economic means utility and moral means socially appraisal of life and world behavior
 inamen sahjanubhuti kriya hi pramukh hai
 It forms the basis of Kroche's art-deliberation
 ye chaar vyapaar nimnlikhit hai- There is an integral relation between instinct and intuition and expression
 jahaan sahaj gyaan hoga vahaan abhivyanjana avashya hogi
 Instinct-knowledge is not possible without expression or expression without instinct
 kroche ne ‘abhivyanjana’ shabd kaa prayog vyapak arth main kiya he, jo shabdic abhivyanjana ke bodh ke saath-saath rekha, swar, geet aadi sabhi madhyamon kaa bodhak he
 Whose pictures, music, dance etc
 have to be expressed in any form
 jo sahaj-gyaan abhivyanjana kaa rup dhaaran nahin kar saktaa vah vastav main sachcha pratibh-gyaan nahin he, vah keval prakritik tathy or samvedan banakar rah jaataa he
 For example, when a painter only sees a glimpse of an object, we cannot say that he has become intuitive
 ham sahaj gyaan kii uplabdhi tab maanenge jab vah uskaa pratyakshikaran kar legaa arthath jab vah apane antarman main use puri tarah abhivyakt kar legaa
 In this way, Croche considers spontaneity to be an internal expression or internal form, which gives rise to the aesthetic element
 vah use aatma kaa abhivyanjanatmak karm maanata he
 Through this action, the artist controls the emotions and impulses of emotions and expresses the effects in the images and gets rid of them
 atah kroche sahjanubhuti ko hi abhivyanjana maanata he
 This expression is internal, not external
 soundarya-gyaan kii vyakhya karte hue kroche ne kalatmak nirmaan kii chaar shreniyan sthir kii hai- But the internal expression falling in the second category is the true expression, because croche gives it the most importance
 kroche kaa kavi koi bhashaa nahin bolta apitu man-hi-man jo murtiman hota rahata he, vah uskaa anand uthaata he
 But poetry is not born in the world unless there is external expression
 vaise bhi saamaanya bhashaa main abhivyanjana se prayojan shabdon dwaara abhivyakti se hi he
 In addition to words in art, there are other means of expression; Such as colors, stones etc
 kintu abhivyanjana siddhanth kii manyata he ki bahya prakaashan athwa sampreshan ke bina hi abhivyanjana kii sampoorn kriya sampann ho jaati he
 Instinct is the central element in Croche's aesthetic philosophy
 unhone purvavarti is dharna kaa khandan kiya ki bina buddhi ke sahaj-gyaan sambhav nahin
 The truth is that even the intellectual elements merge into the intuitive and take the form of the same
 isi prakaar sahaj gyaan or pratyaksh gyaan main bhi bhed he
 The relation of direct knowledge remains in real-unreal and country-time, whereas intuitive knowledge does not distinguish them
 sahaj-gyaan kii seemaa pratyaksh vastuon tak hi nahin apitu disha or kaal kii paridhi se bhi aage tak spasht he
 There is also a clear difference between instincts and sensations, because sensations cannot create a proper image, that is, it cannot be understood as instinct
 sahaj-gyaan prabhaavon kii sakriy abhivyanjana he, jabaki samvednaa yantrikta he, niskriyata he
 Therefore, spontaneity is expression
 scot james kaa kathan he ki ‘‘kroche ke darshan ke anusaar kala kuch nahin, sahjanubhuti athwa maanav-prabhaavon kii abhivyakti he
 "thus, intuitive knowledge is different from other mental trades
 kala kaa sambandh sahjanubhuti se he
 At the time when the spontaneous sensation starts awakening and expressing itself, then art is born
 kroche ke anusaar kala kii abhivyakti ke liye itani prakriya paryaapt he
 Generally, when we discuss art, we mean written works or compositions
 kintu kroche jab kala kii charchaa karata he to uskaa abhipraay aantarik abhivyakti se hota he, jiskaa bahya abhivyaktikaran nahin hota
 When the spontaneity is sprouted, it becomes art by expression
 yah puri prakriya aantarik he, arthath kala kii sristi tathaa siddhi kalakaar ke bheetar hoti he, baahar nahin, kyonki- Therefore, not only the creation of art, its power is also not out
 kroche ke anusaar kala aantarik hone ke saath-saath akhand he, kyonki antavpragna yaa sahjanubhuti akhand hoti he
 When Sahajanubhuti will be Akhand then its expression will also be Akhand, then art will also be Akhand in nature
 vastutah kroche kaa abhipraay yah he ki koi bhi kavy, chitra yaa murti apane purna, akhand, avibhakt rup main hi kavi ke man main sfurit hoti he or us sphuran main hi vah abhivyanjana yaa kalatmak rup grahan kar leti he
 Later the poet only writes that embodied form on paper
 isliye jis kalakaar kaa pratyakshan evam samvedan jitna vyapak, sookshm or samrudh hota he uski kala utani hi utkrisht, manoram tathaa prabhaavshaalee hoti he
 So according to Croche - prashn uthta he ki abhivyanjanawad main kalaagat bahya prakaashan or sampreshan kaa kya sthaan he? kroche bahya-prakaashan chitra, kavy, murti aadi ko ‘samaran dilaane main sahaayak’ athwa ‘uttejnaa pradaan karne vaala’ maanata he
 Through this, the artist again brings back to the instincts or the sensation of the moment when that beauty emerged in his mind
 atah bahya abhivyakti keval vyaavhaarik upyog ke liye he
 This is the reason that external use of art has to be taken for the social use of the art and for being compassionate
 kintu bahya prakaashan kii samast prakriya gyaan kii apeksha ichha-shakti se nikatatar sambandh rakhti he
 For the joy of others, for the moral family, for the repetition in the mind of the critic, the expression of expression as an external representation makes him secondary
 abhivyanjanawad main bahya prakaashan kii vyaavhaarik upyogita ko to mana gaya he, kintu kala ke moulik swaroop main uskaa koi uskaa sthaan nahin he
 Manifestation is knowledge-form and external publisher is karma-form
 bina gyaan ke karm asambhav he, kintu gyaan kaa astitv karm par ashrith nahin rahata
 He is perfect in himself
 nishkarshtah- Crouche has also explained the controversial subject like beauty in a simple way - "the second name of successful expression is beauty or" successful "adjective is also unnecessary, only expression should be known by the name of beauty, because which Expression does not succeed, it cannot be called a expression
 ‘‘ Kroche's belief that art is a sense of difference or intuition and that the existence of an artistic object is in its manifestation
 kisi kavita yaa sundar prakritik drishy ko ham us samay sundar maanate hai jab hamaari bhavanaayen usamen abhivyanjit hoti hai tathaa ham un vastuon main apni bhaawanaaon kii abhivyanjana karte hai
 The artist expresses his feelings through his artwork
 uskaa anand lene vaala vahi ho saktaa he jisamen vah bhaavana vidyaman he
 According to Croche, the true expression of beauty is in the poetry or craft of an artist
 prakruti main koi soundarya nahin he or na soundarya kii bahya satta he
 Actually beauty is beautiful
 atah bahya vastu ko sundar kahana ‘sundar’ shabd kaa lakshanik prayog maananaa chahie
 According to Croche, beauty is an expression of intuitive knowledge
 chunki sahaj-gyaan or abhivyanjana abhedatmak hai isliye yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki soundarya sahaj-gyaan he athwa soundarya hi abhivyanjana he
 Thus, Croche considers beauty to be a religion of innate knowledge or difference
 isliye uski bahya abhivyakti maanane main use sankoch he
 Croche's view is that every person has an artist's share
 iskaa abhipraay he ki prayek vyakti main samvedan-shakti he, usamen sahjanubhuti or abhivyanjana kii kshamta he
 This instinct is stronger in an artist than an ordinary person
 is mat ke anusaar saahityalochak kalakriti kaa adhyayan or moolyankan tark se nahin karata, apitu uske adhyayan main apni bhaavana yaa anubhuti kaa aashray hota he
 He captures the insight or intuitive feeling contained in the artwork
 is prakaar aalochak bhi kalakaar-siddh hota he
 At the moment of judging the artwork, the critic establishes the poet's soul by his experience
 is prasang main dow savitri sinha kaa mat ullekhneey or vichaarneey he
 His belief is that "sahajanubhuti" is near the liberation of Pandit Ramchandra Shukla
 shuklaji ne mana he ki kavita kii rachana karte samay kavi or kavita kaa rasaswadan karte samay pathak hriday kii muktavastha ko praapt karte hai
 In Shuklaji's view, at the time of poetic composition or poetry, a person becomes so emotional that he automatically gives attention to his body and body-related relations for some time
 uskaa sharir-buddhi donon ksheen ho jate hai, uskaa antajkaran aatma ke sahaj gunon ko grahan karne lagata he
 Due to the soul being wide and joyful, at that moment the person's heart becomes wider by crossing personal boundaries and starts to experience a unique feeling of joy
 sankshep main muktavastha kaa arth hua- hriday kii vyapaktaa or anandoplabdhi
 If Dr
 Sinha's opinion is accepted, then the artist or person forgets his limitations in a state of spontaneity and his feeling becomes so intense that he achieves joy due to concentration
 kroche ke abhivyanjanawad kii saahitiyik drushti se upyogita vichaarneey he
 Kroche has shown the basic elements of poetry and the process of creation of poetry in the mind of the poet by this principle
 is siddhanth ke anusaar kavy ke rasaswadan or aalochana main bhi us aatm-tatva ke hridyangam karne par bal diya gaya he
 As far as the soul of poetry and its composition is concerned, this principle is very valuable
 kisi bhi anubhuti yaa kala kaa prakaashan kalakriti ke rup main ho rahaa he or vah saamaajik va aalochak ke liye samvedh banate hai, aisi sthiti main saamaajik ke madhya preshan kaa madhyam kalakriti hi he
 Artistry cannot be neglected while considering art, even if the external form of the artwork is of secondary importance in this entire situation
 is baat ko spasht karne ke liye manushya kii upama di ja sakati he
 In man, self-essence or life-element is predominant, without this his existence cannot be imagined
 kintu phir bhi manushya ke shaareerik-tatva kii kadaapi upeksha nahi kii ja sakati
 Even if the body of a human being is of secondary importance, it is impossible to publish the self-essence contained in it without that body
 sharir ke bina praan-tatva apane astitv ko vyakt nahin kar saktaa
 Therefore, it is clear that the discussion of the artifacts of artwork in Croche's theory has been rejected as unnecessary
 shilp abhivyanjana kaa anivaary paksh he
 If this will not be considered, then there will be discomfort in the expression of self-essence and the method of making it heart-rending
 kroche ke anusaar shailigat visheshtaon ke aadhaar par kalakaar kii aalochana nirarthak hogi
 It is true that usage and appropriateness are not primarily concerned with beauty or expression
 phir bhi jab kavy-kala bahya prakaashan praapt karke kalakriti kaa rup dhaaran karti he, us samay jivan ke sahaj niyam upyogita or auchity uske swaabhaavik ang ban jate hai
 Croche has disregarded this fact
 jaisaa ki kaha gaya he, kroche kaa yah siddhanth bade mahatva kaa he, kintu yah nitant aatmagat ho jane ke kaaran ekangi ho gaya he
 There is a lot of confusion in Hindi about the theory of crochet
 acharya ramachandra shukla ne abhivyanjana ko ‘bhartiya vakroktvaad kaa vilayati utthan’ kahkar use ‘vaguachitrayawad’ kii sangya di
 Since this statement of Shukla ji, the tradition of comparing the expression of Croche with the curvilism of Acharya Kuntak has gone on
 kintu yah uchit prathit nahin hota
 In fact, the expression in Croche's expressionism is not pictorial, it is also wrong to call it quibbleism
 sanskrit ke prasiddh acharya kuntak ne vakrokti ko kavy kii aatma mana he
 By quibble they mean curvature of statement
 kuntak or kroche ke siddhanton main kuch samya avashya he, parantu vaishamy kahin adhik he, jo sankshep main is prakaar he- Hussain Kuwajarwala is an Indian actor, he has acted in many serials and films
 saamaajik lekha yaa saamaajik ankekshan kisi bhi kaarykram athwa kriya, jiskaa sambandh pratyaksh athwa paroksh rup se samaaj se hota he, ke saamaajik nishpati ke moolyankan se sambandhit prakriya he

 In physics, energy is a property of objects, which can be transferred to other objects or transformed into different forms
 kisi bhi kaaryakarta ke kaary karne kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 There is energy in the water falling from a height because it can rotate a wheel to generate electricity
 urja kii saral paribhaasha dena kathin he
 Energy is not an object
 isko ham dekh nahin sakate, yah koi jagah nahin gherti, na isaki koi chaaya hi padati he
 In short, like other things, it is not a substance, although it is often closely related to matter
 phir bhi iskaa astitv utana hi vaastavik he jitna kisi anya vastu kaa or is kaaran ki kisi pind samudaay main, jiske upar kisi bahari bal kaa prabhaav nahin rahata, isaki maatra main kami beshi nahin hoti
 The ability to work normally is called energy
 jab dhanush se shikaar karanevaala koi shikari dori ko khinchataa he to dhanush main urja aa jaati he jiskaa upyog baan ko shikaar tak chalaane main kiya jaataa he
 The flowing water has energy that can be used for running watermills or for any other work
 isi tarah barood main urja hoti he, jiskaa upyog pathar kii shilaayein todane athwa top se gola daagne main ho saktaa he
 The electric current carries energy from which the electric motor can be driven
 surya ke prakaash main urja hoti he jiskaa upyog prakashaselon dwaara bijli kii dhara utpann karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, nuclear energy is there in the molecule, which is used in destroying the enemy or other work
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki urja kai roopon main pai jaati he
 The energy that is in the stem spring is called potential energy; The energy of flowing water is kinetic energy; The energy of gunpowder is chemical energy; The energy of electric current is electrical energy; The energy of sunlight is called light energy
 surya main jo urja he vah uske unche taap ke kaaran he
 This is called heat energy
 vibhinn upayon dwaara urja ko ek rup se duusare rup main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The amount of energy in these changes is always the same
 usamen kami beshi nahin hoti
 This is called energy-indestructibility principle
 upar kaha gaya he ki kaary kar sakane kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 But it is not always possible to convert all the energy into work
 isliye yah kahana adhik upyukt hoga ki urja vah vastu he jo utani hi ghatati he jitna kaary hota he
 For this reason, they are the units of measuring energy
 jo kaary ko naapane ke
 If we lift a kilogram of a meter high, then a certain amount of work has to be done against the gravity of the Earth
 yadi ham isi bhaar ko do meter unchaa uthaayen athwa do kilogram bhaar ko ek meter unchaa uthaayen to donon dashaon main pehle kii apeksha duuna kaary karnaa padegaa
 This shows that the magnitude of the work depends on the magnitude of the force against which the work is done and the magnitude of the distance, the distance by which the force is worked against, and is equal to the product of both these dimensions
 
 kaary kii kisi bhi maatra ko ham kaary kaa ekak maan sakate hai
 For example, the work that one kilogram has to do to lift a meter high against the attraction of the earth can be considered a unit
 parantu prithvi kaa aakarshan sab jagah ek samaan nahin hota
 Its value in Chennai is not in Delhi
 isliye yah ekak asuvidhapurna he
 Yet engineers in many countries use similar units
 jise foot-pound kehete hai
 This is the amount of work that is done on the beach in London's latitude using one pound of another unit dependent on the centimeter-gram-second
 isamen bal ke ekak ko "dine" kehete hai
 Dine is a unit of force that can produce a velocity of one centimeter per second in one gram of a second
 is bal ke kriyabindu ko iske viruddh ek sein
 me
 hataane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use varg kehete hai
 But in practical terms this unit of work is very small
 atev dainik vyavhaar main ek doosraa ekak upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The unit of length is meters instead of centimeters and the unit of mass is kilograms instead of grams
 isamen bal kaa ekak "newton" he
 Newton is a unit of force that can produce a velocity of one meter per second in a second in a kilogram of body
 is tarah newton 1 xxrep 5 0 dine ke baraabar hota he
 The work required to remove the action point of this force up to one meter against it is called Joule
 ek jul 107 argo ke baraabar hota he
 Energy is also measured in these units
 parantu kabhi kabhi vishesh sthalon par kuch anya ekakon kaa upyog hota he
 They have one electron volt
 vah urja kaa vah ekak he jise electron kaa volt ke vibhavantar se guzarane par praapt karata he
 It is a very small unit and is only equal to 1
60 x 10 -19 joules
 iske atirikt gharon main upyog main aanevaali vaidyut urja ko naapane ke liye ek duusare ekak kaa upyog hota he, jise kilowat-ghanta kehete hai or jo 3
6x 10 6 julon ke baraabar hota he l urja ke unit ko jhon perscot jul ke urja ke kshetra me ek kranti laane kii yaad me 'jul' rakhaa
 Instead of those objects, whose existence we can only estimate on the basis of logic, we have a much easier knowledge of those objects which we can see in a broad way
 manushya ke mastishk main urja ke us rup kii bhaavana sabase pratham udai hui jiskaa sambandh bade bade pindon se he or jise yantron kii sahaayta se kaaryrup main parinaat hote ham spashtat: dekh sakate hai
 There are two forms of this mechanical energy: one is potential energy and the other is kinetic energy
 iske vipareet us urja kaa gyaan jiskaa sambandh anuon tathaa parmaanuon kii gati se he, manushya ko baad main hua
 For this reason, it is no less surprising that even before Newton, Francis Bacon believed that heat is due to the motion of particles of matter
 ek kilogram bhaar ke ek pind ko prithvi ke aakarshan ke viruddh ek meter unchaa uthaane main jo kaary karnaa padataa he use ham kilogram-meter kah sakate hai or yah lagbhag 981 julon ke baraabar hota he
 If we take a string and put it on top of a pulley and tie about one kilogram of bodies from both its ends and leave them in such a position that both of them are not at the same height and allow the upper body to come down very slowly, then we We will see that one kilogram will raise the object one meter high
 ghirani main gharshan jitna hi kam hoga doosraa pind bhaar main utana hi pehle pind ke bhaar ke baraabar rakhaa ja sakegaa
 This means that if we raise a body higher than the earth
 ek kilogram bhaar ke pind ko yadi 5 meter unchaa uthaaya jaae to usamen 5 kilogram-meter kaary karne kii kshamta aa jaati he, evam uski urja pehle kii apeksha usee pariman main bad jaati he
 This energy is due to the relative position of the Earth and the body and is actually the energy of the system made by the Earth and the body
 isiilie ise sthitij urja kehete hai
 Whenever there is a difference in the mutual distance of a community of objects or the natural position of different parts of the same body, there is a difference in potential energy
 kamaani ko dabaane se athwa dhanush ko jhukaane se unamem sthitij urja aa jaati he
 If the water is collected at a higher height by damming the rivers, then this water brings potential energy
 newton ne bal kii yah paribhaasha di ki bal samveg ke parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 If a body of m kg is initially stationary and has a constant force F, working for t seconds, the velocity it produces is v m per second, then the value of force is mvt { \ displaystyle { \ frac {mv} {t} }} Will be Newton
 isi samay main pind jo duuri tai kare vah yadi d meter ho to bal dwaara kiya gaya kaary F
d jul ke baraabar hoga
 That is, if the velocity of the mass in m mass is v then its energy will be 1 2 mv 2 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1} {2}} mv ^ {2}}
 yah urja us pind main uski gati ke kaaran hoti he or gatij urja kehalaati he
 When we release the arrow by tilting the bow, the potential energy of the bow changes to the kinetic energy of the arrow
 sthitij urja evam gatij urja ke parsparik parivartan kaa sabase sundar udhaaharan saral lolak he
 When we pull the pendulum to one side, the ball rises slightly above its normal position and the potential energy comes into it
 jab ham golak ko chhodte hai to golak idhar udhar jhulane lagata he
 When the ball is in the normal position of hanging, it only has kinetic energy
 samveg ke kaaran golak duusari ore chalaa jaataa he or gatij urja pun: sthitij urja main parivartit ho jaati he
 Normally, working against the friction of air reduces the energy of the ball and its motion stops in some time
 yadi gharshan kaa bal na ho to lolak anant kaal tak chalata rahegaa
 Even after the theory of energy-indestructibility in motion science was proven, it was believed that energy can be lost in many situations due to lack of knowledge of its other forms; For example, when there are expected speeds in different parts of a body, potential and kinetic energy decreases due to friction
 vastut: aisi sthitiyon main urja nasht nahin hoti varan ushma urja main parivartan ho jaati he
 But until the 18th century, heat was not considered an independent form of energy
 us samay tak yah dharna thi ki ushma ek dravya he
 It was proved indisputably by experiments in the 19th century that heat is also another form of energy
 yon to pragaitihaasik kaal main bhi manushya lakadiyon ko ragadkar agni utpann karata tha, parantu urja evam ushma ke ghanishtha sambandh kii ore sabase pehle benjamin tamson kaa dhyaan gaya
 It was a resident of the United States of Massachusetts
 parantu us samay yah bavaria ke raja kaa yudhmantri tha
 While piercing the molded brass cannon tubes, he noticed that the tube becomes very hot and the fillets from it become even more heated
 ek prayog main top kii naal ke chaaron ore kaath kii naand main pani bharkar usne dekha ki kharadane se jo ushma utpann hoti he usase dhai ghante main sara pani ubalane ke taap tak pahunch gaya
 In this experiment, his real goal was to prove that heat is not a liquid that is in the bodies and due to pressure comes out like water from the cloth by squeezing; Because if this were the case, there would be only a limited amount of fluid in a body, but it is known by the use of perforator that the more work done, the more heat will be generated
 rumuard ne yah prayog san 1798 i
 main kiya
 20 years before this, Lavaggee and lagrange saw that animals produce as much heat from food as can be obtained from food by chemical reactions
 san 1819 main francisi vaigyanik dulon ne dekha ki kisi gas ke sampeden se usamen ushma usee anupaat main utpann hoti he jitna sampeden main kaary kiya jaataa he
 In 1842 AD, the same sentiment was used by Julius Robert Maier, who was then only 28 years old and a doctor in the city of Highbronn, Germany, to calculate how much work is necessary to produce a heat of heat
 
 ham jaanate hai ki prayek gas kii do vishisht ushmayen hoti he : ek niyat aaytan par tathaa duusari niyat daab par
 In the first stage, the gas does not work
 duusari avasthaa main gas ko bahya dabaav ke viruddh kaary karnaa padataa he or donon vishisht ushmaaon main jo antar hota he vah isi kaary ke samatuly hota he
 In this way, the value of mechanical equivalent of heat that Maier received was almost the same as that of Count Rumford
 isi samay england main james presskaat jul bhi ushma kaa yantric tulyank nikaalane main laga hua tha
 Its use continued from 1842 AD to 1852 AD
 apane prayog main isane ek taanbe ke ushmamapi main pani liya or use ek mathni se matha
 The churn was run on two loads hanging from two pulleys
 jis door se ye bhaar latake hue the vah is mathni ke sire main lapeti hui thi or jab ye bhaar neeche kii ore girte the to mathni gumti thi
 When these loads fell, their potential energy was reduced
 is kami kaa kuch bhaag bhaaron kii gatij urja main parinat hota tha or kuch bhaag mathni ko ghumaane main vyay hota tha
 In this way it could be known how much work was being done to rotate the churn
 ushmamapi ke pani ke taap main jitani vruddhi hui usase yah gyaat ho saktaa tha ki kitni ushma utpann hui; or tab ushma kaa yantric tulyank gyaat kiya ja saktaa tha
 Joule did these experiments with both water and mercury
 san 1847 i
 main harmaan phan helmholts ne ek pustak likhi jisamen ushma, chumbak, bijli, bhautik rasayan aadi vibhinn kshetron ke udaahranon dwaara ushma-avinashita-siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya tha
 Joule proved the similarity of electrical energy and heat energy by experiment
 dekhen - vidyut urja In 1905, Einstein proposed his relative theory according to which the mass of particles depends on their kinetic energy
 iskaa yah arth he ki urja kaa maan dravyaman vruddhi ko prakaash ke veg ke varg se guna karne par praapt hota he
 This theory is confirmed by many experiments in nuclear science
 surya main bhi urja isi tarah banati he
 There is a chain reaction in the Sun, which results from the combination of four nuclei of hydrogen to form the nucleus of helium
 hydrogen ke chaaron nabhikon ke dravyaman kaa yogafal helium ke nabhik se kuch adhik hota he
 This difference is converted into energy
 parmaanu bam evam hydrogen bam main bhi isi dravyaman-urja-samatulyata kaa upyog hota he
 Studying what is the exact formula for the distribution of the radiation of the Krishna body according to the different alphabets of the spectrum, Plank came to the conclusion that the exchange of radiation does not happen in irregular amounts by small particles of direct energy
 in kanon ko rahata he
 Multiplying the frequency number by which the value of the energyquantum is obtained is called the Planck constant
 niles bor ne san 1913 i
 main yah dikhalaayaa ki yah kwantum siddhant atyant vyapak he or parmaanuon main electron jin kakshaon main ghoomte hai
 Those orbits are also fixed according to quantum theory
 jab electron adhik urjawali kaksha se kam urjawali kaksha main jaataa he to in do urjaaon kaa antar prakaash ke rup main baahar aata he
 Heisenberg, Schrödinger and Dirac have expanded this quantum theory even further
 aadhunik bhautik vigyaan main prayek kaary ke liye urja ko aavashyak bataaya gaya he
 According to the energy conservation principle, energy can neither be generated nor destroyed, only its form can be changed
 ham apane dainik jivan main prayog karne hetu urja ke istemaal kai roopon main karte hai, yatha - yantric urja, vidyut urja, ooshmiya urja, prakaash urja, rasaynic urja ityadi
 The electrical energy in the motor is converted into mechanical energy and the chemical energy in the battery into electrical energy
 maanav sharir khaadya padaarthon kii rasinic urja ko pachaa kar usase yantric kaary karata he
 Similarly, an electric bulb converts electrical energy into light and thermal energy
 car yaa bas kaa eenjan petrol kii rasinic urja ko pehle ooshmiya urja main badalata he tathaa use phir yantric urja main
 The energy used for all these functions comes from these sources - urja kii avadharana unnisvin shatabdi main aayi
 It is a very important and fundamental concept invented by humans
 yah vibhinn prakaar kii ghatnaon main hone vaali antarkriyaaon ko sankhyatmak rup main vyakt karne main bahut upyogi he
 In a way, it can be understood as a universal currency for interactions between different physical phenomena
 urja kii avadharana se hi parivartan evam transmishan se sambandhit he jo ki audyogic kranti ke aadhaar hai
 As long as only human or animal energy was used, energy was limited; It was a difficult task to automate and control
 kintu vaashp aadi se chalane vaali mashiinon ke avishkaar se yah sthiti badal gayi jisase audyogic kranti kaa sutarapaat hua
 In the modern period, the energy consumed by a country is a major measure of its development

 The current MLA from here is Benedick r Marak
 is nirvachan kshetra se vidhayakon kii suchi nimnavat he – The Commonwealth Prajabhoomi or Commonwealth Territories, known in English as the Commonwealth Realm, are said to be the 16 universal nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, ruled by the same ruler, Queen Elizabeth II
 ye saare desh ek hi rajasatta, shaasha, rajpariwaar or uttaradhikaar kram ko saanjhaa karte hai
 The system began with the Statute of Westminster of 1931, by which the then Dominion of Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were granted equal or complete legal independence with equal members of the British Commonwealth
 She had gone
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad se, vishwa bhar main vistrut, british samrajya ke tamaam deshon ko ek dominian ke rup main swadhinata pradaan kar di gayi
 Some of which, despite being completely independent, maintained their loyalty to the monarchy, while some states refused to consider the British monarchy as the nominal head and declared themselves a republican state
 aaj, vishwa baahar main kul 16 aise rajya hai jo swayan ko maharani elizabeth dwitiya ke ek prajabhumi ke rup main pahchaan karavvate hai
 Under the British sovereign in the English language, these states are commonly known as Rialm, which is derived from the French word royum, a realme, a state, territory or territory over which a king / queen rules
 yahan yah jaananaa aavashyak he kii, united kingdom yaa rashtramandal yaa kisi bhi rashtramandal pradesh kii aadhikarik shabdaawalee main "realm" ek vaidhik yaa kanoonee shabd nahin he, arthath "realm" kii koi kanoonee paribhaasha nahin he
 Therefore, there is no obligation that these states under the British sovereign be addressed by any special name, nor does the term "realm" define any particular status of a state
 haalaanki, 1950 ke dashak se hi, british samprabhu ke raaj ke adheen aanevaale rajyon ko rashtramandal ke anya sadsy deshon se vibhakt rup se bodh karne hetu "realm" shabd kaa upyog adhikaarak dastavezon main kiya jaataa rahaa he, yahan tak kii rani elizabeth ke rajasidhaaran kii ghoshnaa main bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These states are called realms because, despite being under the same ruler, all these states are completely universal, and completely independent from each other, so it is not part of 16 countries, one political unit, but 16 There are different states
 kyonki, reyalm ek kanoonee shabd nahin he, isiilie iskaa koi aadhikarik anuwaad bhi upasthit nahin he
 Therefore, to understand these states, any word that makes sense of the land under a king can be used
 saadhaaran taurapar, prajabhumi, pradesh, or paribhumi jaise shabdon kaa prayog hota he, inke alaava, pramandal or rajbhumi shabdon kaabhi upyog ho saktaa he
 According to the present situation, since the year 1992, there are a total of 16 Commonwealth tribes in the world, with a total area of 1,87,00,000 square kilometers, and a population of 14,30,00,000
 jisame se 6 sabase adhik aabaad desh hai:united kingdom, canda, australia, newzealand or jamaica
 The system of Rajmukut or The Crown is a special political concept, which has a very important role in the legal and political system of Britain and other Commonwealth territories
 is soch kaa vikaas england rajya main samantvaadi kaal ke dauraan shabdic mukut tathaa rashtriya sampadaaon ko samprabhu tathaa unke / unki vyaktigat sampatti se vibhakt kar sambodhit karne hetu hua tha
 According to this view, the Rajmukut is seen as a symbol of state and governance in all aspects of administration and in every dimension, and the British sovereign is seen as a continuous incarnation of the Rajmukut
 atah britain tathaa rashtramandal pradeshon me is shabdaawalee ko shashan athwa sarkaar ke liye ek upalakshan ke rup main bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, yaa sidhe-sidhe aisa bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yah rajtantr ko hi sambodhit karne kaa ek doosraa tarika he
 Legally, "rajmukut" can be defined as an individual institution which is the entire judicial embodiment of the legislature, executive and judiciary
 atah is sandarbh main is shabd ko kisi shahi poshaak ke vaastavik mukut ke saath sambhramit nahin karnaa chahie
 As an institution, the Rajmukut is the oldest functioning institution in Britain's political system
 prayek rashtramandal pradesh main rajmukut kii sankalpana saamaan, parantu vibhakt vidhik sankalpanaayen hai
 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Québec "also the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc
, and because, Canada and Australia are federal nations, so each Canadian province and Australian state" Rajmukut "
 mukut ke adhikaron ko yaa adhirat dwaara swayan yaa phir unke pratinidhi dwaara, sambandhit mantriyon yaa adhikariyon kii salaah par prayog kiya jaataa he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
