 If any one of these national languages is used, then the country whose native language it is, will gain immense political and cultural benefits and superiority
 is kaaran se yah upaay anya sadasyon ko sweekaar nahi he, tathaapi universal postal union main aaj bhi francisi bhashaaka upyog mukhya bhashaa ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The solution to this problem is to use a neutral and organized language like Esperanto or Edo
 is bhashaa kaa upyog jaateey bhashaaon ke badale main rakhana nahi, magar logon ke bich ke antar ko mitaane ke liye kiya jayega, jo log or prakaar se sambhaashan nahin kar pate
 In this way we can meet in the middle way and no one party will benefit more than other people
 jo bhashaa chun lee jaae vah bahut kritrim nahin honi chahie
 Its vocabulary should be based on popular languages
 uskaa vyakaran ho sake utana saral hona chahie bina kisi apwaad yaa muhaavaron ke, jo rashtriya bhashaa seekhneyvaalon ke maarg main baadhaayen utpann karte hai
 This idea inspired many people, among them Padre Schlair, inventor of the Volapük language and Doctor Zamenhof, whose language Esperanto is the most widely held language in the world for the past century
 kuch saalon ke prayog ke baad is bhashaa main kai sudhaarna karne ke prastaav kiye gayi
 Esperantoka's rule is such that the adjective and the words he finishes must have the same last letter
 is prakaar kii jatilta kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he jaise kii angreji or hungary kii bhashaayen dikhalaati hai jinke vyakaran main visheshan aparivartit hote hai
 And Zamenhof was also compatible with this sentiment, but Esperanto's grammar rules did not change for several reasons
 in sudhaaran sujhavonke aadhaar par kuch vaigyanikon ne or bhashapravinon ne milakar ido bhashaa ko viksit kiya
 The committee consisted of language proficiency professor Otto Jespersen and French mathematician and philosopher Professor Louis Courtois
 inhone asperanto or idiom neutraal jaisi nirmit bhashaaon se ati uttam visheshtaon ko chunaa or isamen sudhaarna karke ek aisi bhashaaka vistaar kiya jo duniya main sabase saral or riti sahit bhashaa avashya hogi
 Another very logical and convenient permission was in the eyes of Doctor Zamenhof
 esparanto bhashaa main koi vyakti yaa jaanwaron ke sangya adhiktar pulling hote hai
 If the gender of these words is to change into feminine, then they are distinguished
 isaki jagah main zamenhof sangyaao main ling kaa bhed na rakhane kii sochane lage parantu yah badal nahi hua
 These improvements were adopted in Edo language but not in Esperanto
 jin logon ne in donon yojit bhashaaon kaa abhyaas kiya he unamem se adhiktar log ido ko pasand karte hai
 Both languages have many things in common, including the inspiration of Schleyer and Zamenhof
 esparanto kii pragati chaahane waalon ke asandigdh utsaah or vyagrata ke kaaran anterrashtriya sahaayak bhashaa ke failaav kaa vichaar bahut janaa hua he
 Esperanto is also a well-known and simple language, but many people do not like it because of its unique and extraordinary accent and unnecessary complexity
 jahaan esparanto main kamiyaan hai waha ido unhe sudharkar aage badhati he
 Those who have experience of Edo know how easy it is to think what we have to say, not how we should say it
 parantu yah sab hui siddhant vishyak baaten, saadhaaran vyavhaar main ido kisi he? ido bolanewaalon kii kai sammelne anek deshon main ho chuki he
 This proves that the use of this language is successful
 ido ke bare main pustaken, shabd suchiyaan or vyakaran sikhaanevaali pustaken anek rashtriya bhashaaon main prakashit he
 There is also a lot of poetry written in this language and a funny story about a heroic theme
 ek nai duniya unki raah dekhati he jo bhi is prashansaneey bhashaa ko seekhney kaa thodasa prayaas karen
 This language can also be used as a hobby and in addition can be a means of getting more information about the world
 is samay ido seekhney ke liye hindi main koi pustaken yaa anya saadhan nahi he
 Hindi speakers can learn Edo through any other language
 antarjaal main aise kai sthaan hai jahaan par angreji yaa kisi or europee bhashaa ke dwaara ido sikhi ja sakati he
 The Ranjana script is a script derived from Brahmi in the 11th century
 yah mukhyatah nepal bhashaa likhane ke liye prayukt hoti he kintu bharat, tibet, china, mongolia or japan ke mathon main bhi iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he

64 Orchha near Jhansi has its own significance in the history of India
 isse judi tamaam kahaniyaan or kisse pichhali kai dashakon se logon kii jubaan par hai
 Some people say that the first people started living in Bundelkhand
 yahi vajah he ki is ilaake ke har gaanv or shahar ke paas sunaane ko kai kahaniyaan hai
 Two beautiful and interesting places of Bundelkhand are Orchha and Kundar
 bhale hi donon jagahon main kuch kilometre kaa faasla ho, lekin itihaas ke dhaagon se ye donon jagahen behad majbootee se judi hui hai
 Orchha is located about half an hour from Jhansi
 iskaa itihaas 8veen shatabdi se shuru hota he, jab gurjar pratihaar samraat mihir bhoj ne isaki sthapana kii thi
 The first and most interesting story of this place is that of a temple
 darasal, yah mandir bhagwaan ram kii murti ke liye banwaaya gaya tha, lekin murti sthapana ke vakt yah apane sthaan se hili nahin
 This idol was brought from Ayodhya by his queen Ganesh Kuwar during the reign of Madhukar Shah
 chaturbhuj mandir banane se pehle ise kuch samay ke liye mahal main sthapit kiya gaya
 But after the temple was built, no one could move the idol from its place
 ise ishwar kaa chamatkaar maanate hue mahal ko hi mandir kaa rup de diya gaya or iskaa naam rakhaa gaya ram raja mandir
 Today the city is situated around this palace and thousands of devotees gather here on Ram Navami
 vaise, bhagwaan ram ko yahaan bhagwaan maanane ke saath yahaan kaa raja bhi mana jaataa he, kyonki us murti kaa cheharaa mandir kii ore na hokar mahal kii ore he
 There is a garden near the temple in which two very high towers are the center of attraction of the people
 jinhen sawan bhadon kaha jaataa he ki inke neeche bani surangon ko shahi parivaar apane aane-jane ke raste ke taur par istemaal karata tha
 There is a legend about these pillars that according to Hindu calendar in the rainy season, these two pillars were joined at the end of the month of Sawan and the beginning of the month of Bhadon
 haalanki iske bare main pukhta saboot nahin hai
 The paths to the bottom of these minarets have been closed and there is no way of research
 in mandiron ko dashakon puraane pul se paar kar shahar ke bahari ilaake main 'royal anchlev' he
 There are four palaces, Jahangir Mahal, Raj Mahal, Sheesh Mahal and Rai Parveen Mahal built some distance away from them
 inamen se jahangir mahal ke kisse sabase zyada mashhoor hai, jo mughal bundela dosti kaa pratik he
 It is said that Emperor Akbar sent Abul Fazl to control Shahzade Salim, but Salim killed him with the help of Bir Singh
 isse khush hokar saleem ne orchha kii kaman bir singh ko saunp di thi
 By the way, these palaces are evidences of the architecture of the Bundelas
 khule galiyare, pattharon vaali jaali kaa kaam, jaanwaron kii murtiyon, belboote jaisi tamaam bundela vaastushilp kii visheshtaayen yahaan saaf dekhi ja sakati hai
 Now these very cool looking palaces were not like this in their era
 yahaan rojaanaa hone vaali nai halchal se upji kahaniyaan aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par hai
 One of these is the story of Hardaul, which dates back to the reign of Jujhar Singh
 darasal, mughal jasuson kii sajeeshabhari kathaon ke karan is raja kaa shaq ho gaya tha ki uski rani se uske bhai hardaul ke saath sambandh hai
 So he asked the queen to poison Hardaul
 rani ke aisa na kar paane par khud ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye hardaul ne khud hi jehar pi liya or tyaag kii nai misaal kaayam kii
 With the end of the Bundelaas reign in 1783, Orchha too was lost in the thick forests of oblivion and then it came into the limelight during the freedom struggle
 darasal, swatantraaa senaanee chandrashekhar aaazaad yahaan ke ek gaanv main aakar chhipe the
 Today a memento is also made at his place of stay

 There are two bowed elephants at the entrance of the palace

 Lord Shri Ram was enthroned 400 years ago in Orchha and since then Lord Shri Ram is worshiped here as a king
 yah puri duniya kaa ekmaatr aisa mandir he jahaan bhagwaan ram ko raja ke rup main puja jaataa he
 There is a fascinating story of Ramraja coming from Orodha to Orchha
 ek din orchha naresh madhukarshah ne apni patni ganeshkunwari se krishna upasna ke iraade se vrundavan chalane ko kaha
 But Rani Ram was a devotee
 unhone vrundavan jane se manaa kar diya
 In anger, the king told him that if you are such a Ram devotee, then go and bring your Ram to Orchha
 rani ne ayodhya pahunchakar sarayu nadi ke kinare lakshmana kile ke paas apni kuti banaakar sadhana aarambh kii
 These days, Saint Shiromani Tulsidas was also practicing meditation in Ayodhya
 sant se aashirwad paakar rani kii aradhana drudh se drudhtar hoti gai
 But the queen did not see Ramaraja for several months
 antat: vah niraash hokar apane praan tyaagane sarayu kii majdhaar main kud paddy
 Here he saw Ramaraja in the deep depths of water
 rani ne unhen apana mantavya bataaya
 Ramraja agreed to walk to Orchha but he kept three conditions - first, this journey will be on foot, second - the journey will be only in the flower constellation, third - the statue of Ramaraja will not rise again from the place where it will be kept
 rani ne raja ko sandesh bheja ki wo ramraaja ko lekar orchha aa raheen hai
 King Madhukarshah built the Chaturbhuj Temple at a cost of crores to establish the Deity of Ramaraja
 jab rani orchha pahunchi to unhone yah murti apane mahal main rakh di
 It was decided that the statue would be consecrated by placing the idol in the auspicious idol in the Chaturbhuj temple
 lekin ram ke is vigrah ne chaturbhuj jane se manaa kar diya
 It is said that Ram came here as a child and leaving his mother's palace, how could he go to the temple
 ram aaj bhi isi mahal main virajman hai or unke liye bana karodon kaa chaturbhuj mandir aaj bhi viraan pada he
 This temple is still idolless
 yah bhi ek sanyog he ki jis samvath 1631 ko ramraaja kaa orchha main aagaman hua, usee din ramcharita maanas kaa lekhan bhi purna hua
 The idol present in Orchha is told that when Ram was going to exile, he gave one of his child idols to mother Kaushalya
 maa kaushalya usee ko bal bhoga lagaaya karti thim
 When Ram returned to Ayodhya, Kaushalya immersed this idol in the Saryu River
 yahi murti ganeshkunwari ko sarayu kii majdhaar main mili thi
 It is the only temple in the world where Rama is worshiped as a king and he is given a salute before sunrise and after sunset
 yahaan ram orchhadhish ke rup main maanya hai
 There are temples of Hanuman ji all around the Ramaraja temple

 brajabhasha mulat: braj kshetra kii boli he
 | From whose west it can be found in the sub-languages of Rajasthani
 haryana main yah dilli ke dakshini ilaakon main boli jaati he- faridabad jila or gudgaanv or mevaat jilon ke purvi bhaag
 It developed mainly in western Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 mathura, bharatpur,hindun city, dhaulpur, agra, gwalior aadi ilaakon main aaj bhi yah mukhya samvaad kii bhashaa he
 The Brajbhasha exists either in its original form or with slight changes in this one area
 isiliye is ilaake ke ek bade bhaag ko brijanchal yaa brijbhoomi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The "brajbhasha" developed in the tradition of Indian Aryan languages is born from the womb of Shaurseni Apabhramsa
 jab se gokul vallabh sampradaay kaa centre bana, brajabhasha main krishna vishyak sahitya likhaa jane laga
 With this effect, the dialect of Braj became a literary language
 bhaktikaal ke prasiddh mahakavi mahatma surdaas se lekar aadhunik kaal ke vikhyath kavi shri viyogi hari tak brajabhasha main prabandh kavy tathaa muktak kavy samay samay par rache jate rahe
 Due to the influence of district life, many forms of Braj Bhasha are visible to us
 kintu thode se antar ke saath unamem ekarupata kii spasht jhalak hamen dekhne ko milti he
 Brajbhasha has its own metaphorical nature, that is, its singular masculine nouns and adjectives are often immediate; Nouns such as Khurpou, Yamrau, Manjou, etc
 are out of date
 isi prakaar karau, goru, saanwarau aadi visheshan pad aukarant he
 The common past-present singular masculine form of the verb also remains predominantly in Brajbhasha
 yah baat alag he ki uske kuch kshetron main "y" shruti kaa aagam bhi paaya jaataa he
 In the dialect of Tehsil Kol of District Aligarh, the common past tense form is devoid of "Y" Shruti, but "Y" Shruti is definitely found in the Tehsils of District Mathura and South Bulandshahr
 jaise : "" Carau Chora Bolou "" -
 ""karau chhora bolgau"" -
 "" Carau Landa Bolou "" -
 kannauji kii apni prakruti okarant he
 In the forms of nouns, adjectives and verbs, Kannauji follows Okranta where Brajbhasha moves with inertia
 jila aligarh kii jalapadiya brajabhasha main yadi ham kahen ki- ""karau chhora bolau"" to ise hi kannauji main kahenge ki-""kaaro larika bolo
 The future verb kannauji has a tintarupini, but in the Brajbhasha, it is found to be kridantarupini
 yadi ham "ladkaa jayega" or "ladki jaaegi" vaakyon ko kannauji tathaa brajabhasha main roopantarit karke bolen to nimnaankit rup pradaan karenge : In Kannauji - Lurika Jai hai
 bitiyaa jaihai
 In Brajbhasha - Chhora Jaigou
 chhori jaigi
 It is clear from the above examples that the verb in the common future tense form of Brajbhasha changes according to the gender of the subject, while there is a form in Kannauji
 iske atirikt kannauji main avadhi kii bhanti vivruti kii pravriti bhi pai jaati he jiskaa brajabhasha main abhaav he
 Sandhyrithya is often found in the nouns, pronouns, etc
 of Kannauji, but in Brajbhasha, those terms are found in the rheumatic state
 udhaaharan : Kannauji - "" Bu Go ""

 All these sub-castes also blended so well that they are now referred to as the Punjabi Arora as a whole or simply as the 'punjabi' community
 aroda log, visheshkar bade shaharon main rahane vaale aroda jati ke log or adhik udaaravaadi hote ja rahe hai or isi ke saath varna vyavastha kii adhikadhik avhelnaa kar rahe hai

 Cassia refers to a fragrant leaf of bay laurel
 Fresh or dried bay leaves are used in cooking for their distinct taste and aroma
 in patton kaa istemaal aksar soup, dampukht, brejon or pate jaise bumadhyasagariya vyanjanon main swaad ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The fresh leaves are very dim and do not develop their full flavor until they are broken and dried for several weeks
 kai anya paudhe "be lif" shabd kaa upyog karte hai, lekin vah be laurel kii pattiyon ke sandarbh main nahin hota

 tej patta asia miner main shuru hua or bumadhya or upyukt mausam vaale anya deshon main fail gaya
 Cassia is not grown in northern areas, as these plants do not thrive in cold climates
 turki tej pattey ke pramukh niryaatkon main se ek he, haalanki inhen france, belgium, italy, rus, madhya america, uttar america or bharat ke kshetron main bhi paaya jaataa he

 laurel ko pracheen puranic kathaon main paae jane vaale kendriya ghatak ke rup main paaya jaataa he jo is ped ko sammaan ke pratik ke rup main mahima mandit karata he
 Cassia is one of the most widely used herbs in cuisine in Europe and North America
 agar saabut khaaya jaae to, tej pattey tikt hote he or iskaa swaad tej, kadava hota he
 As with many spices and flavor-enhancing ingredients, the aroma of bay leaves is more notable than its taste
 sukhaye jane par, isaki khushboo jadi booti jaisi, thodi si pushp jaisi or kuch had tak ajvayan ke pattey or jalanim ke jaisi hoti he
 Michelin, which is a component of many aromatic oils used in making perfumes, can be extracted from bay leaves
 tej pattey main sugandhit tel ujenol bhi shaamil he
 Cassia is a specialty of cooking many European dishes and is also used in North America
 unka istemaal soup, dampukht, maance, samudri bhojan or subjiyon ke vyanjan main kiya jaataa he
 These leaves also spread their taste in many classical French dishes
 in pattiyon ko aksar inke puure aakaar main istemaal kiya jaataa he or parosane se pehle hataa diya jaataa he
 Bay leaves are often used in Indian and Pakistani cuisines as an ingredient in biryani and other spicy dishes, and in hot spices - though not in everyday household kitchens
 tej pattey ko khaanaa pakaane se pehle kuchlaa yaa pisa ja saktaa he
 Crushed leaves provide more of their desired fragrance than standing leaves, but are more difficult to remove and are therefore often used in a muslin bag or tea bag
 pisi hui pattiyon ko khadey pattey kii jagah istemaal kiya ja saktaa he or inhen hataane kii jarurat nahin hoti, lekin yah vardhit satahi kshetra ke kaaran apekshaakrit majboot hota he or kuch vyanjanon main banaavat vaanchhneeya nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 Bay leaves can also be used in the pantry to ward off edible pests, flies and cockroaches
 yah bhi sach he ki roman log saint velentine diwas par apane takiye ke neeche ek sookhaa tej patta rakhte hai
 It was believed that because of this leaf, the user encounters his future spouse in a dream
 madhya yug main tej pattiyon ko garbhpaat karaane vaala or kai jaadui gunon vaala mana jaataa tha
 They were sometimes used to keep insect-mites away, due to the presence of loric acid in the leaf which gave it insecticidal properties
 tej pattiyon main kai aise gun hai jo unhen ucch rakt sharkara, migraine sir dard, bacterial or kavak sankraman or gastric ulcer ke ilaaj main upyogi banaate hai
 Bay leaves and berries have been used for their astringent, carminative, diaphoretic, digestive, diuretic, emetic and appetite-enhancing properties
 tej pattey ke tel, kaa prayog chhilane or moch main tila ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Bay leaves have been used as an herbal remedy for headaches

 Bay leaf helps the body insulin process more efficiently leading to a decrease in blood sugar level
 iskaa istemaal pet ke ulcer ke prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye bhi kiya gaya he
 Bay leaves contain eugenol, which provides anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties
 tej patta kavak-virdohi or jeevanu-virdohi bhi hota he or iskaa istemaal gathiya, rajorodh or pet dard ke ilaaj ke liye kiya gaya he
 Some members of the laurel family, as well as unrelated but identical mountainous laurel and cherry laurel, have leaves that are toxic to humans and animals
 jabaki in paudhon ko paak istemaal ke liye kahin bhi bechaa nahin jaataa he, tej pattey ke saath unki samanta ne is dharna ko bal diya he ki tej pattey ko khaanaa pakaane ke baad bhojan se hataa diya janaa chahie kyonki ve jahrile hote hai
 This is not true - bay leaves can be eaten without toxic effects
 haalanki, ve puri tarah se khaanaa pakaane ke baad bhi bahut kathor bane hue rahete hai or agar inhen sabut yaa bade tukdon main nigal liya jaae to ve pachan tantra main kharonch yaa ghutan kaa jokhim paidaa kar sakate hai
 Thus in most recipes using bay leaves it is recommended to remove them after the cooking process
 thand se mukt yaa halke thand vaale kshetron main mali yah pate hai ki zamin main rope gaye be laurel paudhe swechha se vishaal vriksh, 38 feet or unase bhi lambe ho jate hai; lekin chantai karte rahane par be laurel ped ek choti jhaadi kii tarah badhata he
 Bay laurel can also be grown in containers, the size of which prevents its growth as the final shape of the tree
 nae paudhon ko leering, yaa kalam ke dwaara ugaaya jaataa he, kyonki beej se ugaana mushkil ho saktaa he
 Bay trees are difficult to grow from seed, partly because of the low seed germination rate and long germination period
 The germination rate of freshly removed pods is typically 40%, while the germination rate of seeds including dried seeds and / or pods is even lower
 iske alaava, be laurel ke beej kii ankuran avadhi 50 din yaa usase adhik hoti he, jo ankurit hone se pehle beej ke sad jane ke khatre ko badha detaa he
 Treating the seeds with gibberellic acid can be as useful in increasing the yield of the seed as carefully monitoring the moisture level in the root circulation

 kisi bhi janmkundali main teen raashiyon ko mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 The Rashi, in which the Sun of the Jataka is located, as the sun-rashi, in which the Lunar of the Jataka is situated, it is in the form of the lunar-rashi and the Rashi which is rising in the eastern Kshitij at the time of the birth of the Jataka -rashi is considered as important

 In its place, extracting lagna-rashi fruit can benefit the readers immensely, because if there is a difference of about two hours in the birth time, then there is a change in the lagna of two people, while under Chandrashi within two and a half days and under sun sign All people born within a month fall in the same amount
 lekin chunki pathakon ko apane lagn kii jaankaree nahin hoti he, isliye jyotishi lagnfal kii jagah raashi-fal nikaalkar jansadharan ke liye sarvasulabh to kar dete hen, par isse jyotish kii vaigyaniktaa par prashnchinh lag jaataa he
 Some type of occasional prediction can be made accurately based on a person's lagna, but its intensity may vary for different people

 panzia, panjeya yaa panji, ek vishaal ekikrut mahadweep tha jiskaa astitv lagbhag 250 million varsh pehle peliojoik or mizozoik yug ke dauraan tha; maujuuda mahadweep apane vartmaan swaroop main isi main se nikal kar aaye hai
 The name was coined in the scientific discussion of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental flow
 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1

 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar

 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
 Meanwhile southern Europe fragmented from Gondwana and the newly formed rake began to move across the ocean towards Euramerica and collided with the southern Baltic in the Devonian, although this small continent was in the form of an underwater strip
 ipitas mahaasaagar kii shakha khantee mahaasaagar bhi siberia se ek dweepiya vrutt ke rup main sikud rahaa tha jo purvi baltic se takaraa gaya
 a new ocean, the Ural Ocean, was present behind this island
 silurian kaal ke ant main uttar or dakshin china gondvanaa se dur chale gaye or sikudte hue proto-tethis mahaasaagar ke paar uttar kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or iske dakshini sire par nayaa peleo-tethis mahaasaagar khul rahaa tha
 In the Devonian period, Gondwana itself started moving towards Euramerica, causing the Rake Ocean to shrink
 praarambhik carbonipheras yug main uttar-pashchim africa ne uramerica ke dakshin-purvi tat ko chhu liya tha jisase epalchian parvaton or messeta parvaton ke dakshini hisson kaa nirmaan hona shuru ho gaya tha
 South America moved northward towards southern Euramerica while the eastern parts of Gondwana started moving from the equator to the south pole
 uttari china or dakshini china swatantra mahadwipon par sthit the
 The small continent Kazakhstania collided with Siberia in the Middle Carboniferous era
 pashchimi kazakhstania carbonipheras yug ke ant main baltic se takaraayaa jisase unke bich ural mahaasaagar kaa sampark band ho gaya karne or unamem pashchimi proto-tethis ural parvaton or vishaal mahadweep loresia kii utpatti kaa kaaran bana
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa antim charan tha
 Meanwhile, South America collided with southern Laurentia, closing the rake ocean and forming the southernmost part of the Appalachians and Ouachita Mountains
 is samay tak gondvanaa dakshini dhruv ke paas sthit ho gaya tha or antarctic, bharat, australia, dakshin africa or dakshin america main glaciaron kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Part of northern China had collided with Siberia by the end of the Carboniferous era and thus the proto-tethys Ocean was completely closed
 parmian yug kii shuruyaat main cimerian plate gondvanaa se vikhandit hokar alag ho gayi or yah loresia kii ore badhane lagi jisase iske dakshini sire par ek nayaa mahaasaagar, tethis mahaasaagar nirmit ho gaya or plato-tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya
 Most of the terrain was still integrated
 trysic kaal main panzia thodaa sa dakshin-pashchim disha main gum gaya tha
 The Cimmerian plate was still crossing the shrinking paleo-tethys which continued until the middle of the Jurassic period
 The paleo-tethys was closed from west to east, thus creating the Cimmerian Orogeny
 panzia angreji ke "si " akshar kii tarah dikhaai detaa tha jisamen si ke andar ek mahaasaagar, nayaa tethis mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Pangea had cracked by the middle of the Jurassic period, its fragmentation is given below
 panzia ke jeevashm-pramaan main mahadwipon par paayi jane vaali ek jaisi or abhinn prajatiyon kii maujuudagi shaamil he jo ab kaaphi dur chale gaye hai
 For example, fossils of therapsid Listerosaurus are found in South Africa, India and Australia, along with members of the Glossopteris flora that would have extended from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their current positions; Similarly, the freshwater reptile Mizosaurus is found only in the local areas of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa
 panzia ke atirikt pramaan dakshin america ke purvi tat or africa ke pashchimi tat ke bich bhuvaigyanik rujhaanon ke milan sahit isse sate mahadwipon ke bhugarbha main paae jate hai
 The polar ice layer of the Carboniferous period covered the southern end of Pangea
 visheshkar ek hi yug tak kii himandiyon ke sangrah or sanrachanaayen kai alag mahadwipon par paayi jaati hai jo panzia mahadweep main ek saath rahe honge
 Paleomagnetic studies of apparent pathways of polar aberration also support the theory of giant-continent
 bhuvaigyanik chattaanon main chumbakeey khanijon ke unmukhikaran kaa pareekshan kar mahadwipiya platon kii halchal ko nirdhaarit kar sakate hai; jab chattaanon kaa nirmaan hota he, ve prithvi ke chumbakeey gunon ko apane andar samahit kar lete hai or yah sanket dete hai ki chattan ke saapeksh dhruv kis disha main maujuud hai
 Since the magnetic poles tilt toward recurring poles occur only over a period of a few thousand years, measurements are averaged over several lavas of several thousand years to determine a clear average polarity position
 talchhati chattaanon or ghuspaithi aagney chattaanon ke namoonon main ek chumbakeey jhukaav hota he jo aam taur par chumbakeey uttar ke jhukaav main in 'ek saamaan badlaavon' kaa ek ausat hota he kyonki unke chumbakeey kshetra turant nahin ban jate hai jaisaa ki thande ho rahe lava ke maamle main hota he
 The magnetic variations between sample groups that have a difference of millions of years in age are due to a combined real polarity deviation and movement of continents
 vaastavik dhruviya vichlan ke ghatak sabhi namoonon ke liye samaan hote hai or inhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 This gives geologists a part of this drift that shows continental stirring and can be used to help redefine earlier continental conditions
 parvat shrinkhalaaon kii nirantarata bhi panzia ke liye sakshya uplabdh karaate hai
 An example of this is the Appalachian mountain range that extends from the northeastern United States to the Caledonides of Ireland, Britain, Greenland, and Scandinavia
 panzia ke vikhandan ke teen pramukh charan the
 The first phase began in the Early – Middle Jurassic period when Pangea began to diverge from the Tethys Ocean in the east and the Pacific Ocean in the west, eventually leading to the development of the vast continents Lauresia and Gondwana
 jo daraar uttari america or africa ke bich bananaa shuru hua tha usne kai asafal daraaron ko janm diya

 The balance is temporary when the maximum distance is and permanent when it is minimum
 utplavkatal ke mukhya vakratakendron ko aplav centre kehete hai
 If the gravity center of the body in the subplot center is above c, then the equilibrium for the main displacements corresponding to m is permanent, if below, temporary and if c and m are the same point, the equilibrium is neutral
