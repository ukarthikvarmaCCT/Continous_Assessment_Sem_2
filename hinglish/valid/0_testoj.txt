 vyatikaran se kisi bhi prakaar kii tarangon kii ek duusare par parsparik prakriya kii abhivyakti hoti he, jiske parinamswaroop kuch vishesh sthitiyon main companon or unke prabhaavon main vruddhi, kami yaa udaseenta aa jaati he
 a detailed study of interference works at the core of all instruments with large resolution power
 bhautik prakaashiki main is dhaaran kaa samavesh thomas yang ne kiya
 Interference after them has been used to express the homogenous or tajjanic effects of waves or vibrations of any kind
 sankshep main kisi bhi tarah kii tarangagati ke kaaran laharon ke takaraav se utpann sthiti ko vyatikaran kii sangya di jaati he
 Whenever two different wavelengths meet together on the surface of water or any other fluid, a state of interference can occur
 jahaan ek tarangasamooh se sambanddh laharon ke tarangashringon kaa duusari shrunkhlaa se sambhddhalaharon ke tanrgashringon se sammilin hota he, vahaan drav kii sataha kaa unnayan us sthaan par laharon ke swatantra or ekant astitv ke sambhav unnayanon ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 When the wavelength of one of the waves ends at the wavelength of the other, the wave oscillation at the surface of the fluid is reduced and the yield gradient is equal to the difference between the elevation of one wave component and the gradient of the other
 dhwani main utpann vispand isi vyatikaran kaa ek saadhaaran rup he, jahaan do yaa do se adhik tarangasamooh, jinke tarangadairdhya main maamuli sa antar hota he, kareeb ek hi disha main agrasar hote hue milte hai
 The speed of light is waves
 kisi ekal prakashasrot se ni:sruth urja madhyam ke parshv main saan rup se bikhar jaati he
 If two independent sources of light from which waves of the same magnitude and integral art form continuously oscillate, are placed adjacent to each other, then the distribution of energy around the medium is not congruent, where the beak of one light is on the beak of the other light, Or the wavelength of one falls on the wavelength of the other, the amplitude increases there and the energy or light intensity of the amplitude also increases
 saath hi, yadi ek kaa tarangashring duusare ke tarangagart par gire, to parinami aayam shunya hota he or prakaash kii tivrata ghat jaati he
 The first state is called collateral interference and the second one is called destructive interference
 paardarshee thos ke patale patton or sabun ke bulabulon par prakaash kii kirnon ke padane par vyatikaran kaa spasht parichay mil saktaa he
 When rays of light fall on soap bubbles, or thin strips of lead, the rays from both their outer and inner surfaces are reflected and returned to the observer's eyes and in wavelets of light that reach the eyes from both sources, Due to the subtle differences in the arts, there is interference, due to which the effects produced are quite seductive and fascinating
 sabun kaa koi bulbula ekvarni prakaash main praaia: kuch kaali rekhaon se aavruth dikhaai padataa he
 The reason is that the two wavelengths of light at the black visible points, which come from the inner and outer surfaces of the bubble, respectively, almost or completely destroy each other's effects
 yadi bulbula shwet prakaash main dekha jaae, to hamen saamanyatya kaali rekhaayen nahin dikhaai padatin
 They are replaced by strips of color
 aisa isliye hota he ki vibhinn rang, jinke yoga se shwet prakaash kii utpatti hoti he bhinn bhinn tarangon ke hote hai, jisase bulbule ke kisi bindu par vyatikaran se rang ke keval ek ansh maatr kaa vinaash hota he or ujle prakaash ke shesh avyav batch rahete hai, jo aankhon par apana purna varniya prabhaav utpann karte hai
 There are some basic conditions that need to be met for the deviation
 inamen se kuch to prakaash kii prakruti main hi antarnihit he or duusari, yadi parinaam kaa prekshan prayog dwaara karnaa hua to, aavashyak ho uthati he
 For simplicity, we can consider two electromagnetic waves, which produce perishable interference at a point from where both waves pass
 yadi vyatikaran kaa praturup sthir rahaa, arthath yadi prakaash kii tivrata kaa parinami tathakthith bindu par samay ke prayek maan ke liye shunya ho, to nimnlikhit sharton kii purti aavashyak he : Two other conditions for successful observation of light-generated patterns, which must be met, are: yadi do atisannikat prakashasrot ke samaan pariman or kalantar kii taragen kisi kalantar vishesh par kuch dur sthit parde ke ek bindu par milen, to parde par kuch bilkul kii rekhaayen jinke antaraal main adhiktam tivrata kii rekhaayen rahati hai, dekhi jaati hai
 Those minimum and maximum intensity lines are called interpolation fringes
 jab kabhi vyatikaran fringen patali filmon ke chalate banati hai, tab unka kaaran vyatikaran main bhaag lenevaali kirnon ke kalantar kaa parivartan hota he
 This change is caused by a change of film thickness, or a change of volume angle
 yadi motaai samang nahin hui, to praaia: donon tathy ek hi saath kriyasheel ho uthte hai; lekin ek baat spasht he ki jab koi film aankh dwaara dekhi ja rahi he, to use aankh se kareeb 25 senmi
 kii duuri par rakhaa janaa chahie
 If the range of the film is not very large, the difference of the tilt of the rays coming from different points of the film to our eyes is not much and the volume angle of each ray is almost equal
 at: fringen mukhyat: film kii motaai kii bhinnata ke kaaran banati he
 It is also quite clear that at all the points of the film, where the thickness is the same, the light will be the same
 yadi aisa koi bhi bindu kaala yaa ujwal hua, to shesh bhi tadnurup kaale yaa ujwal honge
 Therefore, black or bright strips are just the point of different points of the film of the same thickness

 mcdonald a aquarium or artificial reservoir, a water-filled pot, or glass tank, is where live aquifers or plants are kept
 ye shalaays mukhyat: machhliyon ko paalane or unke kauthuk dekhne dikhaane ke kaam main aati hai
 Evidence of fishes being raised has been found until at least 4,500 years ago, when Sumerians used to raise them in cows or puddles for food
 kintu sambhav he ki yah pratha isse bhi purv prachlit rahi ho
 It is difficult to say when fish first started to be raised in India, but in China, among the Asian countries, red fish began to be cultivated during the reign of the Shung Dynasty for decoration and decoration
 chiniyon ne chote baratanon main rakhane yogya tathaa sajaavat ke uparyukt machhliyon kii vishesh jatiyon kaa vikaas kiya
 Today, the beautiful domesticated fishes have been obtained from the species whose fish they promoted through the selection of best breeds
 roman logon main bhi paaltu machhliyaan rakhane kaa varnan he
 These fish were reared in hoes, or small ponds
 shishe ke baratanon yaa shaalaaon main machhlee paalan kii pratha 200 varshon se adhik puraani nahin he
 There are two types of aquariums: public and private
 bhinn bhinn deshon ke anek mukhya nagaron main saarvajanik jaljivshalas sthapit hai
 The cities of New York, Chicago, San Francisco, London, Berlin, etc
 have large aquariums
 inase choti, kintu prasiddh, jaljivshalas madras, hawaii dweep, austrailia, dakshini africa tathaa sanyukt rajya ke washington, philadelphia, boston, baltimor ityadi nagaron main hai
 These aquariums are mainly for public education and recreation, some scientific research is also done in some of them
 ve jaljivshalas alag hai, jinka prayojan mukhyat: vaigyanik anusandhan he
 They are usually huge
 inke saath janata ke vinodarth choti jeevashalas bhi praaia: rahati hai
 Among these, the Pradhan is in a place called Woods Hole in the United States of Massachusetts, Plimuth in England and Naples in Italy
 dekhne kii suvidha main vichaar se jaljivshaalaon kii deevaaren kaach kii banaain jaati hai
 The walls of large reservoirs are of one to one and a half inch thick slab
 saarvajanik jaljivshaalaon kii dekhbhaal ke liye jal ko aavashyak taap tathaa rasinic sanrachana ko banaae rakhana tathaa jalajeevon ke swasthya, bhojan, rog or parjiviyon se sambandhit samasyaon kaa niraakaran bhi aavashyak hota he
 Where appropriate type of water is available in the required quantity, the water required by machines is easily supplied
 taaja jal nagarpalikaon ke jalaashyon se mil jaataa he, kintu is jal ke jeevanuon ko maarane ke liye prayukt chlorin gas ke avshesh ko pehle alag kar liya jaataa he, kyonki yah gas jalashay ke jeevon ko haani pahunchaati he
 If sea water is necessary for the reservoir, then take water from a place in the sea where there is no dirt coming from the rivers, or falling otherwise
 aise sthanon par bhi tufaanon ke kaaran jal upyog ke ayogy thahar saktaa he, isaliye anek jagahon par aisa prabandh rahata he ki hauj main ek baar bharaa hua jal pun: sanchaarit hota rahata he or maarg main uske chaanane or upyukt banane kii kriyaayein sampann ho jaati hai
 For this purpose, water from the livestock goes through a filter and enters a tank at the bottom
 yahan iskaa rasinic shodhan tathaa tapaniyantran hota he
 To maintain the water temperature regularly, heat or cooling thermodynamic devices are used
 neeche ke hauj se pump mashin jal ko uthaakar phir jeevashaala main pahunchaa detii hai
 There are means of ventilation at appropriate places on the route for the supply of oxygen taken from the water by the organisms and for the removal of the carbon dioxide released in it
 is prakaar kii badi sansthaaon main bhinn prakaar kii jalwoyu main paae janevaale jeevon ke liye ushn, samshitoshna tathaa sheethal, samudri jal ke bhinn bhinn jalashay hote hai
 Similarly, reservoirs of soft water of different temperatures are necessary and different temperatures and different alkaline or acidic waters are also required
 jal ke avaagaman ke liye dhaatu ke nalon ke sthaan par, jinka prabhaav vishaiylla ho saktaa he, kaanch ke yaa cement ke plasters kiye hue nal upyukt hote hai
 In the collection of animals, it is important to be careful that they do not get much injury while catching and that they get suitable water and food during transportation
 kuch khaadya saamaan to bazaaron main mil jate hai, kintu kuch khaadya jalashaala ke kaaryakartaaon ko dhoundkar ekatrit karnaa padataa he
 Special attention should be paid to guard against parasites and diseases and pandemics
 jalajeevon ke rogon kii chikitsa kathin he, isaliye nivarak upaay hi adhik prabhaavshaalee siddh hue hai
 Mainly put the organism in a solution in which it is not harmed, but infectious bacteria die
 yadi jalashay ke jal ko thandha na hone diya jaae, to rogon or parjiviyon se vishesh ashanka nahin rahati
 Fishing in small reservoirs along with aquatic vegetation has also led to increased attraction for aquariums in homes and has become popular
 anek jaleey jeev sthir jal main jeevanyaapan ke abhyast hai
 Therefore, the maintenance of these types of livelihoods is relatively simple, although the principles of their care are mainly those that apply in relation to public large livelihoods
 ek mithyaa vishwaas failaa hua he ki sthir jalawaali uparyukt jaljivshaalaon main upasthit vanaspatiyon se jal kaa oxikaran hota rahata he
 Actually, the opposite is true
 vanaspatiyaan bhi raat main, yaa badaliwaale dinon main, jal se usee prakaar oxigen leti or carbon dioxide detii hai jaise jaleey jeev; kintu in jeevashaalaon main vanaspatiyon kii upasthiti se anya laabh hai
 The feces etc
 which come out of the body of fish and other organisms are used as manure for the vegetation and thus the dirt does not get collected in the water
 vanaspatiyon se jalashay kii sundarataa main bhi vriddhi hoti he
 The restoration of oxygen exploited by water by flora and fauna and the removal of carbon dioxide produced by them in water is necessary
 yadi jalashay ke jal or vaayu kaa madhyasth str yathesht vistrut he, to yah kaary swayamev sampadit ho jaataa he
 If this is not the case, it is necessary to expel the air from within the water by pump or any other solution in the form of fine bubbles
 kisi bhi jalashay main yadi jeevon tathaa vanaspatiyon kaa pariman jalwaayu-madhyasth-str ke kshetrafal se santulit rakhaa jaay, to vayusancharan kii vishesh vyavastha kiye bina bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 Apart from raising fish and other aquatic animals, the study of the nature of their offspring is also a fascinating subject
 in jeevon kii lagbhag 300 aisi jatiyaan hai jo jalaashyon main paali ja sakati hai
 The breeding practices of some of these are peculiar
 anek andey detii hai, jinako sene par bachche nikalate hai
 Others give birth to live children, take great care and care for many children
 syam desh kii ladaaku machhliyon kaa nar lasadaar phen kaa awaas bana letaa he
 In this, he keeps protecting the eggs laid by the female
 siclidi jati kii machhliyaan apane andon or bacchon ko bhi suraksha ke liye apane munh main rakhe rahati hai or jitne dinon tak andon main se bachche nahin nikalate utane dinon tak bhojan nahin karti
 The problem of feeding of aquarium fish is not particularly difficult
 machhliyon ke saadhaaran bhojya padaarth or sookshm jalajeevon se inkaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Lava of paddy or bhujia rice has also been found suitable for fishes in domestic animals
 shesh bachaa bhojan jal ko ganda karata he
 Fishes require very little food
 isaliye is bhul kii adhik sambhaavna he ki kam bhojan dene ke sthaan par aavashyaktaa se adhik bhojan diya jaay
 It is always important to keep in mind that as much food is consumed in the reservoir as it can consume
 jaljivshaalaon ke rakrakhaav sambandhi purvokt siddhant machhlee paalane kii sabhi ritiyon par lagu hote hai, chaahe sajaavat ke liye gharon main rakhi janevaali choti jeevashalas hon, yaa bagichon main banaae janevaale hauj hon, athwa bhojan ke liye paali janevaali machhliyon ke pokhare hon
 Governments of almost all countries have made arrangements to maintain adequate fishes in public reservoirs, to keep fish in special fisheries, to conserve their eggs and to raise children
 jahaan sambhav hota he vahaan adon ko machhliyon se alag rakhkar sene or bachche paidaa karne kaa bhi prabandh rahata he
 In this way, any type of fish, small or big, needed to be released in rivers or reservoirs

 Research work - In 1927, the days when you started your research on space rays, the solution to this important question about these rays was being found whether these rays are made of particles with high energy or they are powerful gamma rays Is of caste
 professor milicon kii prerana se andersan ne susangathit yojana ke anusaar apane prayog aarambh kiye
 In these experiments, the cloud was placed in a magnetic field and it was arranged that the photo of the path of the electromagnets appearing in the chamber would be automatically captured every 15 seconds at a time
 in maarg rekhaon kii vakrata naapakar andersan ne nirvivaad rup se 1932 main yah siddh kiya ki antariksh kirnon kii urja jab padaarth main parinat hoti he to ek electron ke saath-saath utani hi dhanvidyut matraavaala doosraa kan bhi utpann hota he, jise 'pazitron' kaa naam diya gaya
 The weight of the positron is exactly equal to the load of the electron
 1936 main pazitron kii khoj ke upalaksh main aapako nobel puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya
 In connection with these experiments, Andersen also suggested that a new race of electromagnets could exist in space rays whose weight should be between the weight of electron and proton and whose electric charge was negative or equal to the charge of electron Should be of positive caste

 pul banane ke liye kancreet bahut upyukt vastu he, kyonki jab yah sughatyavastha main rahati he, tab yah kahin bhi bhari jaasakati he or kisi bhi akruti main dhaali ja sakati he
 Therefore it is used a lot in making bridges
 praaia: pracheenatam kaal se pul banane ke liye saadi kancreet kaa upyog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Essentially, such a bridge was of the shape of an arch of concrete
 bharat main 19veen shatabdi main pahari sadakon par kai pul chooney kii kancreet se banaae gaye the
 Sometimes simple concrete arches are made from pre-cast concrete bricks
 choti puliyon ke liye sthal par hi dhaali kancreet kii mehraaben purnataya upuyakt hoti hai
 a good example of a concrete bridge constructed at the site is the bridge built in Great Britain in 1928 AD
 isamen do parshwavaale dar 50-50 foot ke hai or bichwala dar 110 foot kaa
 The longest rate of plain concrete in the world is the median rate of a bridge over the Rocky River in Cleveland, USA
 isaki lambaai 128 foot he
 Now most of the reinforced concrete is used by steel rods and they can be made at much larger rates than the arches of stone and plain concrete
 kuch mahattam lambaaiwale, prabalit kancreet kii mehrabawale pul nimnlikhit hai : 1

 Concrete bridges have many properties due to concrete
 udhaahrant: chatpat nirmaan or tadnantar marammat tathaa dekhbhaal kii kam aavashyaktaa
 There is no fear of fire in these bridges nor to eat collocation with water
 ispaat ke pulon ko samay-samay par rangate rahanaa nitant aavashyak he, parantu kancreet ke pulon ko rangnaa nahin padataa
 Steel bridges are eroded by collision with the effects of air and water, but reinforced concrete bridges become more and more athletic over time
 yadi acchhee abhiklpana kii jaae to ye sundar lagate hai or inpar vaastukala ke niyamon ke anusaar alankaran kiya ja saktaa he
 They do not have a fumble, all the work has to be done very efficiently in making steel bridges and the work of the craftsmen has to be taken care of
 doosraa dosha yah he ki pul ke liye dhola baandhane main bahut kharch ho jaataa he
 Reinforced cement concrete began to be used in the late 19th century and has progressed rapidly since then
 prabalit kancreet se pul banane kii anek ritiyon kaa vikaas hua he jinamein se kisi ek kaa chunaav sthal kii paristhitiyon par nirbhar he
 There are 13 major types of cement bridges according to rough

 For a particular site, it is possible to find a number of suitable 13 of the aforementioned types
 parantu ant main mahattam kaaryakshmata, mitvyayta or pushtataavaale pul kaa chunaav atyant jatil samasya he
 In order to make a proper choice, one has to make rough calculations and compare the estimates
 purvakthith 13 prakaar or ve paat jinke liye ve upyukt hai, nimnokt hai : 1

multiple rates, joists and leased or only leased 20-40 feet 3

 Double armrest and an attached middle door 60-100 feet 7

 paslidaar mehrab or aanshik latake farshwala 180-250 foot As mentioned above, many types of compositions at a particular place would be suitable according to local conditions
 antim nirnay do karansamoohon par nirbhar he
 The causes of the first group can be called natural
 ye sthaan kii paristhitiyon par purnat: nirbhar hai, jaise neenv, khadaan yaa anya halchal, pul ke upar apekshit khaali jagah or pul kii lambaai
 The second set of reasons is the one that has artificial causes, that is, the maximum load on the bridge
 uski chaudaai kitni ho, uski ruparekha kisi ho or uski akruti kisi ho or in sabase adhik mahatvapurn he uski laagat
 Normally the unconnected, dependent structure is the most expensive, although it is the simplest to design
 jahaan achal neenv mil sakati he, vahaan anamy dhaanchevaala pul sabase sasta padataa he
 Due to the availability of pre-stressed concrete, engineers have gained a new strength, making it possible to construct bridges of wide proportions in the design of concrete bridges
 saadhaaran prabalit kancreet ke pulon kii apeksha purvapratibalit kancreet ke pul 10-15 pratishat tak saste padate hai
 These result in material savings, as larger pots can be made and they can be kept relatively light
 santoshjanak sanrachana ke liye teen aavashyaktaayen hai jinaki purti honi chahie
 The first is that the qualified engineer first prepares complete and detailed structural drafting
 phir, yah ki kancreet banane ke liye saamagree ko saavdhaanee se chunaa jaae or uski puri jaanch kii jaae ki vah aavashyak gunon ke anusaar hi he or ant main yah ki kaarigaron ke kaam kii uchit dekharekh ho
 The importance of proper maintenance and control of proportions is evident from the fact that the strength and durability of concrete of any particular proportion depends on the material being well mixed, properly molded and cured properly and then properly wetted as per the rules
 is
 yah aavashyak he ki dhola thik prakaar se or purnataya drudh banaaya jaae tathaa ispaat kii chhadon ko thik se modaa jaae evam kancreet dhaalane se purv uchit sthaan main rakhkar band diya jaae
 Do not place the steel too close to the surface, otherwise it will start to crumble
 or tab sanrachana kuch dinon main ukhdane lagegi
 Engineers should decide where treaties are put in the structure
 ise thekedaar par nahin chhodana chahie
 Nowadays most of the construction is done by machines
 iske liye yah aavashyak he ki yantra pul ke sthaan par laae jaaen
 Which devices will be required depends on the type of bridge
 mukhya yantra kancreet mishrak, boj uthaanewaale kraine companotpadak, saamagree naapane ke saanche, pump, sampidak, chad modane kii mashine ityadi hai
 Due to the international recognition of aesthetics in bridge design, it has become necessary to focus on the design of line, shape, proportion and material

 babylon ke hanging garden pracheen duniya ke saat aashcharyon main se ek the jo ki helenic samskruti dwaara soochibaddh he, or vibhinn prakaar ke vrikshon, jhaadiyon or daakhaltaaon ke saath tear vaale bagichon kii ek chadhaai shrinkhalaa ke saath ejineering kii ek ullekhneey uplabdhi ke rup main varnit he yah mitti eenton ke bane ek bade hare pahaad jaisaa dikhataa he, yah aaj ke iraqi nagar al-hillah ke nikat sthit tha
 This park was built by Nabuchadnezzar II 600 years before Christ
 isa se 2 shatabdi purv ek bukamp me yah udyaan purna rup se nasht ho gaya tha
 Its name is derived from the Greek word cremastos, a modern English word for "hanging"
 yah ek chat jaise uthaae gaye dhaanche par lagaae jane vaale vrikshon ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to a legend, the Hanging Garden was built by the neo-babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II for his Queen Queen Amitis with a grand palace called The Marvel of Mankind, as she remembered the green hills and valleys of her homeland
 paanch pramukh lekhak hai jinke vivaran aaj maujuud hai jo hanging garden, iske samgr dizin or sinchai ke sadhano ke aakaar ke bare main charchaa karte hai, ki "yah kyon banaaya gaya tha"josephs ne marduk ke babylonian pujari berosas ke bare main bageeche kaa vivaran likhaa, jiskaa lekhan lagbhag 2 9 0 isa purv baagon kaa sabase purana ullekh he
 Diodorus Siculus has consulted the texts of both Clytarchus and Ctesias of Cnidius in the fourth century BCE
 diodoras ek syrian raja ke nirmaan ko bataata he
 According to him the garden was in the shape of a square, about four Plethora tall with each side
 bageeche ko tear kiya gaya tha, upar kii gailaree 50 haath oonchi thi
 The walls, 22 feet thick, were built of brick
 quints curious rufus shaayad diodoras ke samaan sroton par pahunchaa
 According to him the gardens were situated on top of a citadel, which was 20 stadiums in the periphery
 vah baganon ke nirmaan ko syrian raja ke liye jimmedaar tehraata he, is kaaran se ki uski rani apni mathrubhumi ko yaad kar rahi thi
 Strabo based his account on a lost account of Onesitritus, possibly from the 4th century BCE
 unke anusaar bageeche ko euphrates nadi ke baagon kii ore agrasar archimedes ke pench ke madhyam se pani se ugaaya gaya tha
 According to Philo, this construction was due to the engineering and simplicity of building vast areas of deep soil
 samakaleen babylonian sroton main dastavezikaran kii kami ke kaaran yah spasht nahin he ki hanging garden vaastavik nirmaan yaa kavy nirmaan the
 There is also no mention of Amucitis, the wife of Nebuchadnezzar, many records exist in the works of Nebuchadnezzar, yet his long and complete inscriptions do not mention any garden
 herodotus, jisane apane itihaas main babul kaa varnan kiya tha, usne bhi hanging garden kaa zikr nahin kiya haalanki, baganon ko tab bhi astitv main kaha gaya tha jab baad main lekhakon ne unke bare main varnan kiya tha, or inamen se kuch khaaton ko babul kaa daura karne vaale logon se praapt mana jaataa he
 However it may be that the gardens were not well known to the Greeks at the time of their visit
 aaj tak, hanging garden ke liye babul main koi puratathvik sakshya nahin mila he
 It is possible that evidence exists beneath the Euphrates, which cannot be safely opened at present
 nabookadanessar dwitiya ke samay nadi apni vartmaan sthiti ke purv main bahati thi, or babul ke pashchimi hisse ke bare main bahut kuch pataa nahin tha
 Rollinger suggests that Borosas attributed the garden to Nebuchadnezzar for political reasons, and he adopted mythology from elsewhere
 ek prastaav yah he ki babul ke hanging garden vastav main ashshur raja sanherib ne ninave main apane mahal ke liye banaaya tha
 Stephanie Dali believes that both sites were confused during the intervening centuries, and the elaborate garden of Sennacherib's palace was attributed to Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar II

 Dara believed that there is no difference between the truth in Vedanta and Islam except for literalism
 daara krit upanishdon kaa anuwaad do vishwasapathon - islam or vedant - ke ekikaran main mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Under political circumstances, Dara became interested in atheism, it cannot be said with certainty
