lekin raja abhi bhi yuddh se bachanaa chaahate the, isiilie ve apane 1500 sashastr logon ke saath uttari adheekshak se milane chale gayi
 Veera Varma Raja was also ordered to appear
 pazhassi raja kii mukhya maang thi ki kottayam par unke shashan ko sweekaar kiya jaay, lekin unka chachaa is maang ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin tha
 The attitude of the British commissioners was also very arrogant, they were already prejudiced towards the king and therefore the eyes of the king were turned to the logical fact that Veera Varma had no work in Kottayam
 jaise hi vaarta tut gayi, ayuktaon ne kottayam main ek dhamkee kii ghoshnaa kii ki kottayam ke jo log raja kii seva main hai, unhone raja kaa saath nahin choda or apane ghar nahin laute to unhen shatru ghoshit karke unki sampatti jabt kar lee jaaegi
 lekin is ghoshnaa kaa kottayam par koi prabhaav nahin padaa or vahaan british- kurumbranad shashan ke khilaaf pratirodh or majbootahua
 It was a matter of terror for the British that the people of Veera Varma's army also started supporting the resistance and Veera Varma was not much interested in supporting the British, finally his motive was for his personal selfish interest between his nephew and the British That was to provoke war
 tab raja ne 1796 main mysore ke commandent se mulaaqaat ke liye karkankotta kaa daura kiya or 1797 main mysore main puraane dushman tipu se bhi bhent kii, jisane yuddh hone kii sthiti se nipatane ke liye raja kii madad main apane 6000 logon ko karkankotta main tainaat kar diya or vidrohiyon ko bhi gola-barood kii aapurti karne laga
 He also started collecting troops and weapons
 yuddh asann tha
 To deal with Pazhassi, the Bombay Government sent 1200 soldiers and artillery under the Major General
 The British started establishing checkpoints in Kottayam and more troops were sent to Wayanad
 1797 kii shuruyaat main, nair yoddha puure kottayam main uth khadey hue or british chaukiyon kii gheraabandi kar di gayi
 Supporting parties became active throughout Kottayam and military support and supply teams were harassed
 vahi haal vynad kaa bhi tha, jahaan british sainikon ko apane surakshit awaas se baahar aate hi kurichia dhanurdharon kaa saamana karnaa padataa
 in chhapamar karravaiyon se angrejon ko sainik, gola-barood or bhandaron ke maamle main baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 This incident was the most important in the whole war
 1797 main, karnal dov or uski sena ne vynad main march kiya
 His plan was to block the Periya valley and crush a large rebel army in Kannoth when the withdrawal route was closed
 leftinent muali ke maatahat ek sainik dasta periya main dov kii madad ke liye bheja gaya, lekin raste main nairon or kurichiaon ne unhen baari nuksaan pahunchaaya or angrejon ke 105 log maare gayi
 So, instead of going to Periya, they returned to their original base
 dov ke sainikon ko aapurti kii baari kami kaa saamana karnaa padaa or dov ne phir se sahaayta bheje jane kii guhaar lagaai
 tab bombai regiment ke major anderson ke maatahat aapurti sahaayta phir se bheji gayi
 But Anderson's Mappila guides left him at the last minute
 jisase anderson kii yatra main deree hui, yah deree angrejon ke liye ghaatak parinaam vaali sabit hui
 Dow received the news that Tipu had sent his soldiers to assist the king, as Tipu believed that the British entry into Wayanad was a violation of the Seringapatam Treaty
 dov ne faisla kiya ki vah adhikariyon se paraamarsh karne ke liye talasseri jayega or vynad main raja tathaa tipu se ek saath nipatane kii yojana banayega
 vah ek chote se dal ke saath chal padaa, lekin raste main mysore ke sipaahiyon kii madad se raja ke logon ne hamalaa kar diya, lekin dov saafe batch niklaa
 The day after he left, an army of 1100 under Major Cameroon in Periya decided to go to Kottayam via the Periya Valley as the reserves had become empty
 lekin unhen pataa nahin tha ki angrejon kii asli sthiti ke bare main jaanane vaale raja ne unke liye jaal bicha rakhaa he - unhone ghati ke donon taraf bane chhadam baadon main apni sena ko chhip jane ke aadesh die
 As the entire British army entered the narrow valley, the hidden troops attacked it
 yojana sahi dhang se lagu hui or uske baad badi taadaad main british sena maari gayi
 If the team of Major Anderson had not reached there the next day, no one would have survived the lack of medical care
 adhikansh shatru maare gaye or unke jhande sahit unki sabhi bandooken, gola-barood, saamaan or pashu lut liye gayi
 Senior British officers such as Major Cameron, Lieutenant Nugent, Lieutenant Madge and Lieutenant Ruderman were killed in the war
 isi samay ke aasapaas, ayuktaon ne zamorin ke ek tamil brahman mantri kii salaah lene kaa faisla kiya or yaheen se pazhassi raja ke antat patan kii shuruyaat hui
 He decided to harass Pazhassi Raja by creating an irregular army of local traitors

 But for some time, the king was in a strong position

 unhone shanti sthapit karne kaa faisla kiya kyonki ve baichaiyn the ki pahaado or junglee ilaakon main chhapamar yuddh lanbaa chal saktaa he or raja tipu yaa francisiyon ke saath mitrataa kar sakate hai
 He also decided to oust Raja Kurumbranad from the Kottayam administration
 chirkkal or parapapand ke raajaaon ne raja or angrejon ke bich madhyasthata kii or 1797 main pazhassi tathaa angrejon main ek sandhi hui
 In the Treaty of 1797, the following things were agreed upon
 iruvajinad ke naarangoli nambiar ko bhi maafee dene or unki sampatti waapas karne kaa faisla hua
 The king's four-year effort thus ended with his political victory
 chaar saal kii shatruta or yuddh ke baad shanti sthapit hui
 After the fall of Tipu, Wayanad fell into the hands of the British
 angrejon ne vynad par kabje ke liye mysore se sena bheji or use kenra yaa coimbatore ke saath milaane kii yojana banaai
 But as Wayanad was a traditional possession of the Kottayam king and Pazhassi had been in control of the region since 1793, Pazhassi rightly saw it as an act of occupying the country's ancient province
 The king resisted this, for this he mobilized a large army of Nairs, as well as his former soldiers Mappilas and Pathans who became unemployed after Tipu's death
 madras main british sarkaar ne mysore, kenra or malabar ke liye major general arthur ko british sena commandent niyukt kiya
 He planned a two-pronged move from Malabar coast and Mysore to Wayanad and began preparations for it
 raja major general kii chaalon ko dekh rahe the; general ne sahaayta mangvayi or vynad main sadak nirmaan karavaaya tathaa vidrohi desh main chowkiyaan banavaai
 jawaab main, raja ne bhi anek logon kii bhartee kii, isse velsli itnaa bhaybheet hua ki vah raja ke is bhartee abhiyaan kii jaanch karne ke liye vidrohiyon ke parijanon kaa apharan tak karnaa chaha
 The king finds that Wellesley has gone to the Deccan for a military mission; Then the king thought that this was a golden opportunity to act swiftly in the absence of Major General
 ve kuttiadi ghati kii ore chal pade or neeche jaakar unki mulaaqaat valluvanad mappila netaa unni mutha muppan or unke logon ke saath hui
 And soon many great personalities of Iruvazinad like Kampurat Nambiar, Peruvayal Nambiar and Kannoth Nambiar joined the king
 1800 ke monsoon tak, kottayam ke gramin kshetron par niyantran rakhane vaale baagi kottayam sthit british chaukiyon ke liye khatra ban gayi
 Welsley sent an army under Colonel Sartorius to regain the rebels' donkeys in Kottayam
 But this scheme could not be implemented due to not having enough troops in Malabar
 welsli ne vynad ke sabhi sanchaar ko avaruddh karne kii salaah di taaki aapurti ke bina raja ko bhookha maaraa ja sake
 But due to shortage of troops, this plan was also kept on paper
 jis samay, welsli ne malabar tat or mysore kii ore se raja ke khilaaf dotarafa karrwai karne kaa faisla kiya, tab ek ernad mappila netaa athan gurikkal or unke samarthak raja kaa saath dene ko raji ho gayi
 By 1801, a British force of over 10,000 gathered all over Kottayam and Wayanad and blocked all routes connecting Wayanad and Malabar
 itani badi sankhya dekh baagiyon ne kuch samay ke liye bhumigat ho jane main hi samajhadaari dekhi
 raja ne yah bhi paaya ki ve ab dakshini vynad or dakshini malabar main apane samarthakon se sampark nahin kar sakate hai
 The king wandered in the jungles, but still refused any compromise, it was a surprise to the British, as the kings knew that there was no alternative but complete independence
 is ghumantu jivan main raja ke saath unke chah kareebi sahyogi or 25 sashatra sainik bhi the
 First he went north through Payyavur through the mountainous forests of East Chirakkal in search of support
 lekin angrej unki khoj main the, magar unhen pakad paane main safalataa nahin mili
 The king then visited his secret bases at Kottayam and then went to the forests of Kadathanad and Kurumbranad
 angrej is baat se cruddh hue ki ve jahaan kahin bhi jate unhen gupt rup se kuleen janon kaa samarthan mila karata; tab angrejon ne vidrohi raja ko madad dene waalon ko dandit karne kaa faisla kiya
 Peruvayal Nambiar was arrested and hanged as part of spreading terror
 angrejon ne yah dhamkee bhi di ki chah saptaah ke andar aatm samarpan nahin karne vaale baagiyon ko krur dand diya jayega or unki sampatti jabt kar lee jaaegi
 lekin aatmasamarpan karne vaale vidrohiyon ko kshamaa kar dene kii bhi ghoshnaa kii gayi
 But these threats and greed did not work and the king remained free even then
 lekin unke pramukh samarthakon main se kuch ko giraftaar kar liya gaya, jiname bahut prasiddh kannoth nambiar bhi the
 Kannoth Nambiar and his son were also hanged and their property confiscated
 kannoth nambiar kii hatya ke baad, uttari malabar main shmashaan kii shanti vyap gayi, yah toofaan ke pehle kii shanti thi
 Collector Major mcleod thought that the war was over and he began his exploitation program
 usne turant malabar main purna nirastrikaran kii ghoshnaa kii or dhamkee di ki jiske paas bhi hathiyaar milenge use mrityu dand diya jayega
 usne kar kii dar bhi doguni kar di or mahaj chalis dinon ke andar puure malabar main kar ke punarmoolyankan ke aadesh die
 When Malabar was on the verge of revolt and the general public had no other way but to struggle, in 1803 all these 'reform' programs fell on their faces
 mcleod attempted to pacify by taking corrective measures, he canceled all 'reforms' and reinstalled the old system
 lekin tab tak badi der ho chuki thi, kyonki raja ke log vidroh ke liye taiyaar ho chuke the
 The capture of Panamaram Fort was the first major event
 adachenakungan nair ne is abhiyaan kii yojana banaayi or talakkal chandu ke maatahat 150 kurichia dhanurdharon ne unki madad kii
 The fort had 70 soldiers under Captain Dickenson and a few miles from there was a large force of 360 soldiers under Major Drummond at Pulinjali
 agar thik samay par captain kii madad main major aa gaya hota to kurichia sena ko banduukon or sankhya ke jor par parrast kar diya jaataa
 lekin kungan or chandu ne jokhim uthaane kaa faisla kiya
 In this sudden attack led by two generals, the entire army was killed, while only 5 people from this side were killed and 10 were injured
 Dickenson was also killed
 vidrohiyon ko 112 bandook, golabarood ke chah bakse or 6000 rupye mili
 They destroyed the entire fort
 welsli baagiyon kii is gustaakhee par bahut cruddh hua or javaabi karrwai ke liye usne 500 sainik bheje
 lekin tab tak vidrohiyon kii is jeet se puraa vynad or kottayam jaag uthaa
 panamaaram kii safalataa ke nayak, adachena kungan ne pulapalli tirthasthal jaakar logon se raja ke yuddh main shaamil hone kaa aahvaan kiya, falswaroop 3000 log swechha se shaamil hue
 unhen mananthavadi ke valliurkav or adappalli main tainaat kiya gaya or kungan ke bhai ke maatahat unamem se 100 logon ko periya ghati main or 25 logon ko kottiur ghati main tainaat kiya gaya
 The rebel outposts were established along the route from Dindimal to Valliyurkav
 vidrohi sena ke paas zyaadaatar dhanurdhari or talwarbaj the, lekin kuch ke paas bandooken bhi thim
 Adachena Kungan Nambiar led an attack on a British army contingent marching from Mysore towards the Manthanist
 sena ke vynad main pravesh karne or mananthavadi or bhavulli ke bich ek nadi ke paas pahunchane ke baad us par hamale shuru hue
 vahaan nadi kii vipareet disha main vidrohi sena kii banaai gayi khai dwaara unka rasta band kar diya gaya
 But the British army broke the siege of the rebels and a number of people were taken captive due to the arrival of a support unit due to the bad luck of the rebels
 in sabhi kaidiyon ko nirstra kiya gaya or ek sadak par unhen march karaane ke baad unki hatya kar di gayi
 In addition, British aid reached Wayanad from all directions
 lekin angrajon ko vidrohi kahin bhi nahin mil paae
 The rebels had now gathered in Kottayam
 1802 main, unhone kottiur ke paas ek aapurti kafile par chapa maaraa
 kottayam ke logon puure asahyog se angrej hataasha main the
 To add to their trouble, in 1803, a rebel army was stationed at Kurumbranad * and Payyramala * and the people sympathized with the rebels
 british chaowkee ko tabah karne ke liye kungan pazhassi kii ore bad gayi, lekin anek sainikon ke maare jane se unhen peeche hatana padaa
 lekin chirkkal main vidroh fail gaya jahaan sashastr samarthakon ke dalon ne abhiyaan shuru kiya or ye dal aksar khule taur par angrejon se yuddh karne lage
 By the end of 1803, the king's army spread to Kannur and Talassery
 1803 march main, ek vidrohi sena kalikat tak ja pahunchi or up-jail par kabja karke vahaan ke sabhi gardon ko maar daalaa or unke hathiyaar tathaa gola-barood ko jabt kar liya
 He also freed prisoners, many of whom joined the rebel army
 mcclod ke liye to yah had hi ho gayi, so usne is ghatana ke baad turant istipha de diya
 In 1803, Wellesley went to Europe after a three-year inconclusive war with Pazhassi King, later becoming Duke of Wellington and Napoleon's conqueror at Waterloo
 1804 main, ek badi british sena aa pahunchi or 1200 kolkar bhi karrwai ke liye taiyaar the
 Most importantly, a sly Thomas Harvey Baber was appointed Deputy Collector
 isane hameshaa ke liye pazhassi ke vidroh kuchal diya
 It is indeed surprising that Baber, who was not a military expert like Wellesley, did it, which was merely a 'civil servant'
 apni patni hellen somaraville kaa pehla pati or uskaa mitra donald cameron kii mrityu kaa badla chukaane kaa uskaa ek nijee lakshya tha; periya ghati main 9 janvari 1797 ke din pazhassi raja ke haath cameron kii maut hui thi
 Baber became a civil servant to protect the interests of the Bombay-based Inglis and Money families, who were his in-laws' relatives and an influential group of traders
 yah ullekhneey he ki baber ke bete henry fairon baber ne shrirangapattam ke pehle samant or tipu sultan kii maut jorge haris kii potee se shaadi kii
 In 1804, a major revolt led by the king's people was crushed by the British in the forests of Kalyat Nambiar and mostly in East Chirakkal
 agar chirkkal main koi bada or lambey samay tak chalane vaala vidrohi yuddh hua hota, to isse raja ko bahut phayda hota
 Although the king had many supporters in Chirakkal, the rebels, after the failure of the rebellion, started an open war instead of wasting time in a partisan war
 vidroh kii asafalataa kaa ek anya kaaran tha vishwasghaatee kolkar ne bhi paise dene vaale apane gore maalikon kii seva kii
 So once again the rebel army retreated towards Wayanad
 angrejon ne badi sargarmi ke saath unka peechha kiya, jinke saath 2000 sainik or 1000 kolkar the
 a reward of 3000 pagodas for Raja, 1000 pagodas for Edachena Kungan was announced and prizes were also announced for Raja's ten associates
 lekin krantikariyon, zyaadaatar kurumbaaon, ne vynad ke churikunjee main hamalaa kiya
 Although they had to retreat, they had destroyed their enemies
 us saal, kolkar ke ek dal ne raja ko lagbhag pakad hi liya tha, lekin ek kurumba guard ke samay par chetavanee dene se ve batch gayi
 But the monsoon and the brutal climate of Wayanad soon aided the king
 oktober tak 1300 kolkar main se sirf 170 hi biimaar hone se bache rahe
 The king and Edachena Kungan organized a large army of Kurichia and Kurumba at Pulpalli Tirtha and deployed them to Kurichiyat
 iske alaava vynad ke nair kulinon ko raja ke yuddh-prayaas main shaamil karne kii kungan kii koshish kaamyaab ho gayi
 For the last few years, the British had not lost the scale of Periya in 1797, but the matter was not so easy for the British
 yahaan tak ki kottayam bhi ek baar phir se visphotak ban gaya or krantikariyon ke netaa raja ab bhi mukt the
 But it must be remembered that the entire revolution was based on one person, as Wellesley once said, "we are not fighting 1000 people
"

 On 30 November 1805, the king and his companions camped near a river called Mavila or Mavila Tod, close to Karnataka

 But according to Jonathan Duncan, the Governor of Bombay in 1797, who negotiated peace with him, the king was a man with a sweet smile, short stature, long hair and a mustache, often wearing a red cap

 Nevertheless, he kept challenging the Mysoreans for nearly 20 years and the British for 10 years; This is perhaps the best example of how good leadership can compensate for other deficiencies

 As mentioned earlier, the king was opposed to imposing arbitrary taxes on peasants and he also led the war in 1784 and 1793 on this issue; Most of these farmers were from the lower caste

 Abu Bakr said to him, "the Apostle of Allah said, We have no successors, everything we leave is Sadaka
 " umm ayman ke saath milakar, ali ne is tathy kii gavaahi di ki mohammad ne ise fatima jehar ko diya, jab abu bakar ne unase apane daawey ke liye gavaahon ko bulaava dene kaa anurodh kiya
 Fatima became angry and stopped talking to Abu Bakr, and he kept following the attitude until she died
 'aisha ne yah bhi kaha ki "jab allaah ke preshit kii mrityu ho gai, to unki patniyon ne uthman ko abu bakar ko bhejne ke liye kaha ki vah viraasat ke apane hisse ke liye kahen

 Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it

 At this time, Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him

 He told Uthman about criticisms of other allies and acted as negotiator on behalf of Uthman with provincial opponents who had come to Medina; This seems to have caused some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family
 aakhirkaar, unhone gheraabandi kii gambhirtha ko apane aagrah se kam karne kii koshish kii ki uthman ko pani kii anumati di jaani chahie

 muslim itihaas main sabase kathin avadhi main se ek ke dauraan, ali 656 or 661 ke bich khalipha tha, jo ki pehle fitnh ke saath bhi hua tha
 Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polar communal historiography, biographical material is often biased
 lekin sutara is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek gahan dharmik vyakti tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar nyaay kaa shashan tha; vah dharmik kartavyon ke maamle main musalamaanon ke khilaaf yuddh main lage the

 Uthman's assassination meant that the rebels had to choose a new caliphate
 yah kathinaaiyon se mulaakaat kii kyonki vidrohiyon ko muhjirun, ansaar, misravasi, kufaan or basrite samet kai samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha 
 There were three candidates: Ali, Talhah and al-zubair
 sabase pehle vidrohiyon ne ali se sampark kiya, chauthe khalif hone ke liye unhen anurodh karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept office, but he turned down the offer, suggesting to be a consultant rather than a chief
 talha, jubayre or anya saathi ne khalipha ke vidrohiyon ke prastaav se inkaar kar diya
 Therefore, the rebels warned the residents of Medina to elect a caliphate within a day, or they would implement drastic action
 dedlock ko hal karne ke liye, muslim al-masjid en- naabavi main 18 june, 656 ko khalipha niyukt karne ke liye ekatra hue 
 Initially, 'ali refused to accept it, as only his most powerful supporters were rebels
 haalanki, jab madina ke nivaasiyon ke alaava mohammad ke kuch ullekhneey saathi ne unhen prastaav sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya, to vah antat sahamat hue
 According to Abu Mekhnaf's narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'ali, but other legends claimed otherwise that he was forced to give his vows
 iske alaava, talhah or ez-jubayre ne baad main daawa kiya ki unhone unhen anichhaa se samarthan diya he
 Regardless, Ali rejected these claims, insisting that they recognized them as sloppy
 wilferd madelang kaa maananaa he ki bal ne logon se pratigya dene kaa aagrah nahin kiya or unhone masjid main saarvajanik rup se vachan diya
 While many of the rebels, along with the population of Medina, gave their vows, some important figures or tribes did not

 Sa The Ibn Abi Waqqas was absent and 'abdullah ibn' Umar stopped offering his allegiance, but the two assured 'ali that they would not act against him

 Soon after becoming Ali Khalifa, he rejected the provincial governors whom Uthman had appointed, replacing them with trusted allies
 unhone mugira ebn shuba or ebn abbaas ke vakil ke khilaaf kaam kiya, jinhone unhen saavdhaanee se apane shashan ke saath aage badhane kii salaah di thi
 Madelung states that Ali was deeply convinced of his authority and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for political expediency, and to fight against overwhelming odds
 uthman ke sansthaapak muvayah pratham or levent ke governor ne ali ke adeshon ko prastut karne se inkaar kar diya; vah aisa karne vaala ekmaatr rajyapal tha
 Ali's name with Islamic calligraphy in Hagia Sophia, when he was appointed Caliph, told the citizens of Medina that Muslim politics had suffered from dissent and controversy; He wanted to purify Islam of any evil
 unhone jansankhya ko sachche muslimon ke rup main vyavhaar karne kii salaah di, chetavanee di ki vah koi rajdroh bardaasht nahin karegaa or jo log vidhvansak gatividhiyon ke doshi paae gaye hai unhen kathor tareeke se niptaya jayega
 Aisha, Talha, al-zubair and the Umayyads, especially Mu'awiyah e and Marvan I, wanted to punish the rioters who had killed 'ali Uthman
 unhone basra ke kareeb deraa daalaa
 The talks lasted for several days and were later sparked by protests during the heated exchange and parley, leading to loss of life on both sides
 bhram main oont kii ladaai 656 main shuru hui, jahaan ali vijayi ho gaya
 Some historians believe that he used the issue to find his political ambitions because he found Ali's caliphate against his advantage
 vidrohiyon ne kaha ki quran or sunnat ke anusaar shashan nahin karne ke liye uthman ko maar daalaa gaya tha, isliye koi pratishodh nahin kiya janaa tha
 Some say that the Khalifa was the gift of the rebels and that Ali did not have enough force to control or punish them, while others say that Ali accepted the rebels' argument or at least did not consider Uthman a ruler
 Ruler
 aisi paristhitiyon main, ek vivaad hua jisane muslim itihaas main pehla grih yuddh shuru kiya
 Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman to be a rightful and just caliph until the end, who was killed illegally
 kuch anya, jinhen ali kii party ke naam se janaa jaataa he, kaa maananaa tha ki uthman galati main gir gaya tha, unhone khalipha ko jabt kar liya tha or kanoonee tareeke se apane tareeke se sudhaarney yaa kadam uthaane ke inkaar karne ke liye kanoon main nishpadit kiya tha; is prakaar ali sirf sahi or sachche imam the or unke virodhiyon main naastik
 This was not Ali's position himself
 is grih yuddh ne muslim samudaay ke bheetar sthaayee vibhaajan banaae, jinke paas khalipha par kabja karne kaa vaid adhikaar tha
 The First Fitna, 656–661, continued after Uthman's assassination, during Ali's caliphate, and was abolished by the Caliph's notion of Mu'awiya
 is grih yuddh islamic ummeh kii praarambhik ekta ke ant ke rup main khed he
 Ali appointed 'abd Allah ibn al-abbas, the governor of Basra and moved his capital to the Muslim garrison city of Kufa in Iraq
 baad roman-farsi yudhon or bijantin saasaani yuddh ki saikadon varshon se chali, vahaan iraq ke bich gahari jaden matbhed, aupchaarik rup se farsi main the sassanid samrajya or syria aupchaarik rup se ke tahat bijantin samrajya
 The Iraqis wanted the newly established Islamic State capital to be in Kufa so that they could bring in revenue to their territory and oppose Syria
 unhone ali ko kupha main aane or iraq main kupha main rajdhani sthapit karne ke liye aashwast kiya
 Later Muawiyah I, the governor of the Levant and cousin of Uthman, refused Ali's demands for loyalty
 ali ne apane nishtha ko waapas paane kii ummiido ko kholaa, lekin muvayah ne apane shashan ke tahat levent swaittata par jor diya
 Muawiyah refused to pay tribute to Ali by mobilizing his Levantine supporters and saying that his party did not participate in his election
 ali ne apni senaaon ko uttar main sthanantarit kar diya or donon senaayen ek sau se adhik dinon tak cyphin main khud ko deraa daale, zyaadaatar samay baatcheet main bitaai gai
 Although Ali exchanged several letters with Mu'awiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuaded him to pledge allegiance
 partiyon ke bich takaraav ne 657 main cyphin kii ladaai kaa netritv kiya
 After a violent battle known as Lalit al-harir after a week of fighting, Mu'awiyah's army was on the point of passage when Amr ibn al-aas advised Mu'awiyah to pounce his troops
 
 ali ne stratage ke madhyam se dekha, lekin keval ek alpsankhyak ladaai kaa peechha karnaa chahta tha
 Eventually the two armies agreed to settle who should be the caliph through mediation
 ladane ke liye ali kii sena main sabase bada block kaa inkaar karnaa madhyasthata kii sweekruti main nirnaayak kaarak tha
 The question is whether the arbitrator will represent Ali or Kufan, with further division in Ali's army
 ashath ebn kyuu or kuch anya ne ali ke ummidavaaron ko 'abd allaah ebn' abbaas or malik al- ashtar ko khaarij kar diya, or abu musa ashaari par apni tatasthta ke liye jor diya
 Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa
 amrit ebn al- e ko muvayah ne madhyasth ke rup main niyukt kiya tha
 Seven months later the two mediators met in Jordan 658, 10 miles northwest of Mann, in Jordan
 amrit ebn al- abu musa ashaari ne aashwast kiya ki ali or muvayah donon ko kadam uthaanaa chahie or ek nayaa khalipha chune jane chahie
 Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision, which reduced the caliphate to the status of rebel Mu'awiyah
 isliye ali ko muvayah or amrit ebn al-es ne bulaayaa tha
 When the arbitrators gathered at daumit-ul-jandal, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss matters
 jab khalipha ke bare main nirnay lene ke liye samay aayaa, amrit bin al-aas ne abu musa al-ashaari ko is baat kaa manoranjan karne main vishwaas dilaayaa ki unhen khalipha ke ali or muvaaya donon ko vanchit karnaa chahie, or musalamaanon ko chunaav karne kaa adhikaar dena chahie khalipha abu musa al-ashaari ne tadnusaar kaary karne kaa bhi faisla kiya
 According to Punawala, it appears that the arbitrators and other eminent persons met in January 659 to discuss the selection of the new Caliph, with the exclusion of the arbitrators
 amrit ne muvayah kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki abu musa ne apane damaad abdulla ebn umr ko pasand kiya, lekin baad vaale ne sarvasammati se chunaav ke liye khadey hone se inkaar kar diya
 Abu Musa proposed, and Amrit agreed, to leave both Ali and Mu'awiyah and submit a selection of the new Caliph to Shura
 abu musa ke baad saarvajanik ghoshnaa main samjhaute ke apane hisse ko dekha gaya, lekin amrit ne ali ko ghoshit kar diya or muvaaya ko khalipha ke rup main pushti kii
 Ali refused to accept his decision and found it technically in breach of his pledge to hold elections and to follow arbitration
 'ali ne virodh kiya, yah bataate hue ki yah quran or sunnat ke vipareet taur isliye badhyakaari nahin tha
 He then tried to organize a new army, but the Qasr's remnant Ansar, led by Malik Ashtar, and some of his clans remained loyal
 isane ali ko apane samarthakon ke bich bhi ek kamjor sthiti main daal diya
 Mediation resulted in the disintegration of 'ali's alliance, and some have stated that this was Muawiyah's intention
 ali ke shivi main sabase mukhar virodhiyon ne vahi log the jinhone ali ko yudhviram main majaboor kar diya tha
 He broke through Ali's force, rallying under resentment "mediation belongs to God alone
 " is samooh ko kharijiyon ke rup main janaa jane laga
 He considered everyone his enemy
 65 9 main ali kii sena or kharijiyon ne naharvan kii ladaai main mulaakaat kii
 The Qurra then came to be known as Kharijites
 tab kharijiyon ne ali ke samarthakon or anya muslimon kii hatya shuru kar di
 He considered someone who was not part of his group as an unbeliever
 haalanki 'ali ne ek bade antar se ladaai jiti, phir bhi nirantar sangharsh unki sthiti ko prabhavit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 While dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it difficult to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions
 unhone kharijiyon se ladane main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 As a result, 'ali found it difficult to expand the kingdom on its eastern front
 lagbhag usee samay, misr main ashaanti paidaa ho rahi thi
 The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali replaced him with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
 muvayah ne misr ko jeetne ke liye 'amrit ebn al' kii anumati di or amrit ne safaltaapurvak aisa kiya
 Amrit first took Egypt eighteen years before the Romans but was dismissed by Uthman
 mohammad ebn abi bakar ke paas misr main koi lokapriy samarthan nahin tha or 2000 purushon ke saath milakar kaamyaab rahe lekin ve bina ladaai ke fail gaye
 In the following years, Mu'awiyah's army captured many cities in Iraq, which Ali's governors could not stop, and the people did not support him to fight with them
 muvayah ne misr, hijaaj, yaman or anya kshetron ko parajeet kiya
 In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in their favor as people became confused with Mu'awiyah's reign and policies
 haalanki, ali ke prati logon kaa ravaiya gaharaai se bhinn tha
 Only a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and was only entitled to rule over them, while the majority supported him because of his mistrust and opposition to Mu'awiyah
 kaha jaataa he ki ali ne uthman kii maut ke baad khalipha main safal hone ke liye janata dwaara dabaae jane ke baad khalipha ke rankon main vittiya bhrashtachar or anuchit visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf ek asangat abhiyaan kii shapath lee or aagaah kiya
 The Shias argue that despite their unpopularity with the elite, their determination to push these reforms has been a cause of enmity from the rich and privileged former companions of the Prophet
 apane governor malik ashtar ko ek prasiddh patr main, unhone apane samarthak garib virdohi virdohi drushtikon ko vyakt kiya: Remember that dislike and disapproval of ordinary men, acceptance of important persons and resentment of some of the larger ones do not bother more people than imbalances, if the general public and public relations of your subject are happy with you

 ali ne prantiy rajasav par puunji niyantran ke kendrikaran kaa virodh kiya, muslim nagarikon ke bich karon or lut ke baraabar vitaran kaa paksh liya; unhone unke bich khajaane ke puure rajasav ko vitarit kiya
 'ali refrained from nepotism, including his brother' Aqeel ibn Abu Talib
 muslimon ko samanta kii peshkash karne kii unki niti ke musalamaanon ke liye yah ek sanket tha, jinhone apane praarambhik varshon main islam kii seva kii or musalamaanon ko baad main vijay main bhoomika nibhaai
 Ali succeeded in forming a broad coalition, especially after the Battle of Camel
 karon or lut ke baraabar vitaran kii unki niti ne mohammad ke saathi, vishesh rup se ansaar kaa samarthan praapt kiya, jo mohammad, paaramparik janajaatiy netaaon or kurra yaa kuranik pathakon ke baad kuraishi netritv dwaara adhinsth the, jo pavitra islamic netritv kii maang karte the
 The successful formation of this diverse alliance is due to the charismatic character of Ali
 is vividh gathbandhan ko shiya ali ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jiskaa arth he "party" yaa "ali kaa gut"
 However, according to Shia as well as non-shia reports, 'ali supported Ali after his election to support him as the Caliph, the royalists were politically royal, not religiously
 yadhyapi is samay kai log raajnneetik shiya ke rup main gine gaye the, unamem se kuch ali ke dharmik netritv par vishwaas karte the
 His policies and views of governance are revealed in a letter sent to Malik al-ashtar after the appointment of the governor of Egypt
 is nirdesh, jise aitihaasik rup se madina ke samvidhan ke saath islamic shashan ke liye adarsh samvidhan ke rup main dekha gaya he, us samay shaasha or rajya ke vibhinn kaaryakartaaon or samaaj ke mukhya virgon ke kartavyon or adhikaron kaa vistrut vivaran shaamil tha
 Ali wrote in his instructions to Malik al-ashtar: chunki 'ali ke adhikansh log nammaatr or kisaan the, isliye vah krishi se chintit the
 He instructed Malik to pay more attention to the development of land than to the collection of tax, because the tax can only be derived from the development of land and anyone who asks for tax without developing land would have ruined the country
 Is and destroys people
 mukhya lekh: ali kii hatya On 19 Ramadan AH 40, which would correspond to 27 January 661, Ali was attacked by Kharijite abd-al-rahman ibn Muljam while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa
 fajr prarthana main veshya karte hue vah ebn mulajam kii jehar se lepit talwaar se ghayal ho gaye the
 'ali orders his sons not to attack the Kharijites, but rather determines that Ibn Muljam will be pardoned if he survives, whereas if he died, Ibn Muljam would receive only a similar hit
 must be given 
 'do din baad 29 janvari 661 par ali kii mrityu ho gai
 al-hasan fulfilled the Qais and gave equal punishment to Ibn Muljam on Ali's death
 ali kii maut ke baad, kufi muslimon ne vivaad ke bina apane sabase bade bete hasan ke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya, kyonki kai avasaron par ali ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki mohammad sadan ke log muslim samudaay par shashan karne ke hakdaar the
 At this time, Mu'awiyah kept both the Levant and Egypt and, as commander of the greatest force in the Muslim Empire, declared himself the caliph and marched his army to the seat of Hasan's caliphate
 yuddh shuru hua jiske dauraan muvayah ne dhire-dhire hasan kii sena ke generalon or cmanderon ko badi maatra main paise or vaade ko dhokhaa diya jab tak sena ne unke khilaaf vidroh nahin kiya
 Eventually, Hasan was forced to make peace and produce Kuwaifa in Muawiyah
 is tarah muvayah ne islamic khalipha par kabja kar liya or ise ek dharmanirpeksh samrajya main tun kiya
 The Umayyad Caliphate later became a centralized monarchy by Abd al-malik ibn Marwan
 umayyaad ne har sambhav tareeke se ali ke parivaar or shiya par gambhir dabaav daalaa
 The regular public curse of Imam Ali in congregational prayers remained an important institution that was not abolished after 60 years by Omar ibn Abd al-aziz
 madelang likhte hai: Umayyad excesses, corruption and repression were meant to gradually transform the minority of Ali's fans into a majority
 baad kii pidiyon kii yaad main ali vafaadaar ke adarsh commander ban gaye
 According to the fake Umayyad Islam claims legitimate sovereignty in Islam as a sub-rule of God, and in the context of Umayyad betrayal, arbitrary and divisive government and vindictive vengeance, they came to appreciate his honesty, his unbearable devotion
 The rule of Islam, his deep personal loyalty, the equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies
 afghanistan ke majaari sharif main roj-e-shareef, blue masjid - jahaan musalamaanon kii alpsankhyak maanati he ki ali ebn abu talib ko dafnaaya gaya he
 According to al-sheikh al-mufid, Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently he asked his friends and family to bury him quietly
 is gupt kabristaan ko uske vanshaj or chathe shiya imam imam jafar al-sadik dwaara abbasid khaliphot ke dauraan baad main pataa chalaa tha
 Most Shi'ites accept that Ali is buried at the tomb of Imam Ali in the Imam Ali Mosque which is now the city of Najaf, which grew around the mosque and temple called Masjid Ali
 haalanki, kuch afgaanon dwaara aamtaur par banaae rakhaa gaya ek or kahani, note karti he ki prasiddh sharir blue masjid yaa roj-e-shareef main afgaan shahar majaar-e-shareef main unke sharir ko le jaaya gaya tha or dafnaaya gaya tha
 Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority
 dharamshastra or exegesis se sulekh or ank vigyaan se vishyon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa, kanoon or rahasyavaad se arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti se ali dwaara pehali baar mana jaataa he
 According to a hadith described by the Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told of them, "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate 


" Muslims consider Ali a major authority in Islam
 shiya ke mutabik, ali ne khud hi yah gavaahi di: There was not a single verse of the Quran but was revealed, which he did not proceed to direct me and read to me
 main ise apane haath se likhuunga, or vah mujhe apane tafaseer or tavil, nasikh ke rup main nirdeshit karegaa or manasmukh, muhakkam or matashabih, vishesh or saamaanya 


 According to Seyed Hossein Nasser, Ali is credited with establishing Islamic theology and his citations include the first rational evidence of the unity of God among Muslims
 ebn abi al-hadeed ne uddhrut kiya he For the sake of doctrine and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art
 is tarah ke kuch bhi unke vishisht aankadon yaa nichle rankon main se kuch ke bich prasaarit nahin kiya gaya tha
 The art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sage was the only extender
 arabon ke bich sauda karne vaala pehla vyakti ali tha
 In later Islamic philosophies, especially in the teachings of Mulla Sadra and his followers, like Alemeh Tabatatei, Ali's stories and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of spiritual knowledge, or divine philosophy
 sadara ke skool ke sadsy ali ko islam ke sarvocch aadhyatmik chikitsak maanate hai
 According to Henry Corbin, Nahj al-balagha can be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines made by Shiite thinkers, especially after 1500
 iskaa prabhaav shabdon ke taarkik samanvay, katautee main mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he sahi nishkarshon ke, or arabi main kuch takneekee sharton kaa nirmaan jo saahitiyik or darshanik bhashaa main swatantra rup se unani granthon ke arabi main anuwaad ke pravesh main pravesh kiya
 In addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as Jafar, Islamic numerology, and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, have been established by Ali, through which he al-jafar and al-jamia
 ali arabi sahitya kaa ek mahaan vidwaan bhi tha or arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti ke kshetra main agrani tha
 Many of Ali's short stories have become part of the general Islamic culture and are cited in daily life as excitement and stories
 ve saahitiyik kaaryon kaa aadhaar bhi ban gaye hai yaa kai bhashaaon main kavy kavita main ekikrut kiye gaye hai
 In the 8th century, literary authorities such as' Abd al-hamid ibn Yahya al-amiri pointed to Ali's unique pronunciation of sermons and stories, as did al-jahiz in the following century
 umayyaad ke divaan ke karmchaariyon ne bhi apane vakprachaar ko sudhaarney ke liye ali ke upadeshon ko padhaa
 The most famous selection of Ali's words and writings is gathered by a 10th-century Shia scholar, al-sharif al-radi, in a book called Nahj al-balgha, who selected him for his singular rhetorical beauty
 pustak main uddhrut upadeshon ke bich note, andekha upadesh ke saath hi alef ke upadesh bhi he
 According to the legends, some of Muhammad's companions were discussing the role of letters in speaking
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki bolne main alef kaa sabase bada yogadan tha or bindidaar patr bhi mahatvapurn the
 Meanwhile, Ali read two long impromptu sermons, one according to shell writer Langroudy, without using the letter Aleph and the other without dotted letters, without deep and eloquent concepts
 ek isai lekhak jorge Jordac, ne kaha ki Aleph or dot ke bina upadesh saahitiyik kriti ke rup main mana janaa tha
 Ali is respected for his deep sympathy and support for the poor and orphans, and he pursued similar egalitarian policies during his caliphate with the aim of achieving social justice
 unhen yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he: If God grants wealth and prosperity to any person, then he should show kindness to his worthy kith and kin, provide for the poor, help those who are suffering from disasters, misfortune and the reverse, help the poor And honest people should help in ending their debt


 yah kitaab al- kaaphi main sunai gai he ki amir al-muminine ali ebn abi talib ko baghdad ke paas sthanon se shahad or anjir ke saath prastut kiya gaya tha
 Upon receiving the gift, he ordered his officers to bring the orphans so that they could lick the honey from the containers while he rested himself among the people
 nahaj al-balgha main ali ke liye jimmedaar bolne vaale upadesh, patr or uddhran shaamil hai jinhen raakh-sharif aar-radio dwaara sankalit kiya gaya he
 Reza Shah Kazemi states: "despite ongoing questions about the authenticity of the text, recent scholarship suggests that much of the material in it may actually be attributed to Ali" and in support of an article by Mokhtar Jebali Gives reference
 arabi sahitya main is pustak kii ek pramukh sthiti he
 It is also considered an important intellectual, political and religious work in Islam

 Masadir Nahj al-balagha wa Asanidah, written by al-sayyid ‘abd al-zahra’ al-husayn al-khatib, offers some of these sources
 iske alaava, mohammad baqir al- mahamudi dwaara nahaj al-saadah faai mastadra nahaj al-balaghah ali ke maujuuda bhaashanon, upadeshon, niyamon, patron, prarthanaaon or ekatrit hone vaale kahaniyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 There are many commentaries from Sunnis and Shias such as Ibn Abi al-hadid's comments and Muhammad Abdudh's commentaries
 mukhya lekh: ali ebn abi talib or alvi ke vanshadli ne shuruyaat main fatima se shaadi kii, jo unki sabase pyaari patni thim

 aakhri kii maut sandigdh he
 Some historians have added the names of Ali's other sons, including Ibrahim, Umar and Abdallah ibn al-askar, who were killed in Karbala
 unki beti jainab-jo karbala main thim- yajid kii sena ne kabja kar liya tha or baad main hossain or uske anuyaayiyon ke saath kya hua, yah prakat karne main ek badi bhoomika nibhaai
 Ali's descendants are known as Sharifs, stories or stories by Fatima
 ye arabi main aadarneey khitaab hai, sharif kaa arth 'mahaan' he or kaha jaataa he yaa kaha jaataa he yaa 'bhagwaan' yaa 'sar' kahata he
 As the only descendants of Muhammad, he is respected by both Sunni and Shia
 mohammad ke alaava, islamic itihaas main koi bhi nahin he jiske bare main islamic bhashaaon main ali ke rup main likhaa gaya he
 In Muslim culture, Ali is honored for his courage, wisdom, faith, honesty, devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving defeated enemies, and therefore of mystical traditions The center is like Sufism in Islam
 ali kuranik exegesis, islamic nyaayashasre or dharmik vichaar par ek adhikaar ke rup main apane kad barkaraar rakhata he
 Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders that trace his lineage to Muhammad through them
 puure islamic itihaas main ali kaa prabhaav mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Sunni and Shia scholars agree that the verse of Wilayah was recited in honor of Ali, but Wilayah and Imamate have different interpretations
 sunni vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki kavita ali ke bare main he, lekin unhen shiya muslim vichaar main, imam ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa jaataa he, ali ko bhagwaan dwaara mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 There are several verses interpreted by Shia scholars referring to Ali or other Shia Imams
 is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue ki quran main imam ke naamon kaa ullekh kyon nahin kiya gaya he, mohammad al-baqir uttar dete hai: "allaah ne apane paigambar ko salaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin teen yaa chaar rakaton ke bare main kabhi nahin kaha, jakaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin iske vivaranon kaa zikr nahin kiya haj lekin iske tawaaf or paigambar kii ginati nahin hui thi 
 He revealed this verse and the Prophet said that this verse is about Ali, Hasan, Hussain and the twelve Imams
 " ali ke anusaar kuranik chhandon kii ek chauthai imam ke stesan ko bataa rahi he
 Mammen lists many of these verses in his introduction to Shia Islam
 haalanki, kuch chand hai ki kuch sunni tippaneekar ali ke sandarbh main vyakhya karte hai, jinamein se vilaah kii kavita he ki sunni or shiya vidwaan is ghatana ko sanderbhit karte hai ali ne apni anguthi ko ek bhikhaari ko diya jisane masjid main anushthan prarthana karte hue bhakton se poocha
 Mavadda's poem is one of the verses, both Sunni and Shiite associated Ali's name with some other names
 mubahaalaa kii uparokt kavita, or yah bhi pad 2: 26 9 jisamen ali ko shiya or sunni donon tippaneekaron dwaara adwitiya gyaan ke saath sammanit kiya jaataa he is tarah ke chand
 The Shia consider Ali the most important person after Muhammad and he represents a complex, mythological figure in his memory
 vah gunon kaa ek paragon he, jaise saahas, mahanata, eemaandaaree, sidhaapan, vakprachaar or gahan gyaan
 Ali was righteous but faced injustice, he was authoritative but kind and courteous, vigorous but also patient, learned but also a laboring man
 shiya ke anusaar, mohammad ne apane jeevankaal ke dauraan vibhinn avasaron par suzav diya ki unki mrityu ke baad ali musalamaanon kaa netaa hona chahie
 It is supported by many hadiths, narrated by Shams, including the Hadith of the pond of Khum, the Hadiths of two weighty things, the Hadiths of pen and paper, the Hadiths of the Cloak, the Hadiths of the post, the invitation of the Nimath close family, and the twelve successors The Hadith
 jafar al-sadik haddees main varnan karata he ki mohammad main jo bhi gun paaya gaya vah ali main paaya gaya tha, jo uske maargdarshan se dur hokar allaah or uske paigambar se dur ho jayega
 Ali himself describes that he is the gateway and overseer to reach Allah
 is drushtikon ke anusaar, mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main ali ne nyaay main samudaay par shashan nahin kiya, balki sharia kanoon or iske gudh arth kaa bhi arth diya 
 He was therefore considered free from error and sin, and ordained by God by divine decree through Muhammad
 yah twailvar or ismali shi islam main mana jaataa he ki 'ekl, divine gyaan, bhavishyavaktaaon or imaamon kii atmaaon kaa strot tha or unhen goom naamak gudh gyaan diya gaya tha or unke dukh unke bhakton ko divya krupa kaa saadhan the
 Although the Imam was not the recipient of a divine revelation, he had a close relationship with God through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides people

 Extensive secondary sources include the writings of Sunni and Shea Muslims, Christian Arabs, Hindus, and other non-muslims from the Middle East and Asia, and in addition to some works by modern Western scholars
 haalanki, shuruaati islamic sroton main se kuch ali kii taraf sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak purvaagrah se kuch had tak rangeen hai
 Against these assertions there had previously been a common trend among Western scholars and there were reports collected in later periods due to the tendency towards Sunni and Shea biased positions; Later such scholars about him as texture

 Leon Kaitani considered Ibn Abbas and Aisha to be a feature of historical reports during the profits of accounts reported without Isnad by early compilers of history such as Ibn Issaq

 According to him, Kaitani's approach is inconsistent

 tuvaluvi rajtantr, tuvaalu kii sanvaidhanik rajtantr he
 The monarchy of Tuvalu has the distinction of being the unitary sovereign sovereign of all 15 tribes, including Tuvalu and the United Kingdom
 vartmaan satta-vidyaman shaasha, 6 farvari varsh 1952 se maharani elizabeth dwitiya hai
 Tuvalu's political system, like other Commonwealth countries, is based on the Westminster system, in which the position of head of state is nominal, and the real administrative powers are vested at the head of state
 tuvaalu saidhantik rup se ek rajtantr he, or tuvaalu ke shaasha ke padaadhikari iske rashtrapramukh hote hai, haalaanki shaasha kii sari sanvaidhanik shaktiyon kaa abhyaas, unke pratinidhi ke rup main, tuvaalu ke governor-general karte hai
 If the woman is a woman, she is referred to as the "queen of Tuvalu", and a male lady is referred to as the "king of Tuvalu"

 Gradually these colonies were given sovereignty over their administration, and by the Statute of Westminster, 1931 all these states were given full equal status within the Commonwealth
 jo purv upnivesh, british shaasha ko aaj bhi apana shaasha maanate he, un deshon ko rashtramandal prajabhumi yaa rashtramandal pradesh kaha jaataa he
 As the prominent parallel heads of many of these nations, the British academies also find themselves with the title of head of the Commonwealth
 haalanki shaasha ko aam taurapar british shaasha ke naam se hi sambodhit kiya jaataa he, parantu saiddhanthik taur par saare rashtron kaa samprabhu par saamaan adhikaar he, tathaa rashtramandal ke tamaam desh ek-dusre se purnatah swatantra or swytt hai
 The group of members closest to the sovereign's family is called
 haalaanki, aisa koi drudh niyam yaa vidhannheen he, jo yah suniyojit karata ho kii kin vyaktiyon ko is vishesh samooh main rakhaa jaae, naahi koi aisa vidhaan he jo rajpariwaar ko vistrut rup se paribhaashit karata ho
 Generally, individuals from the UK to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness is referred to are generally considered members of the royal family
 rajpariwaar main keval samprabhu ko hi sanvaidhanik kartavya va pad praapt hai
 The sovereign and his immediate family members carry out various official, ceremonial and representational functions of the country
 rashtramandal pradeshon ke bich kaa sambandh is prakaar kaa he kii uttaradhikaar ko anushaasit karne vaale kisi bhi bidhan kaa saare deshon kii ekamat sweekruti aavashyak he
 This obligation was imposed by the Statute of Westminster, 1931
 singhasana par uttaradhikaar, vibhinn aitihaasik sanvidhion dwaara anushaasit he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 uttaradhikaar sambandhit niyam keval sansadeey adhinium dwaara parivartit kiye ja sakate hai, jinhen saare prajabhumiyon kii sweekruti samet paarit hona anivaary he
 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he
 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories
 singhasana kaa koi uttaradhikari, swechha se apana uttaradhikaar tyaag nahin kar saktaa he
 The government of Tuvalu does not provide any financial assistance to support the maintenance of sovereign, royalty or royal residences located outside the country
 haalanki, samprabhu yaa shahi parivaar ke daure ke samay aane vaale kharchon kaa prabhaar sarkaar uthaati he
 Apart from this, the official expenses of the governor-governor-general are also borne by the government
 sattadhari rani / raja par saidhantik rup se ek sanvaidhanik shaasha ke adhikaar nihit he, parantu paramparanusaar in sari shaktiyon kaa abhyaas keval sansad or sarkaar ke vinirdeshon ke anusaar hi, shaasha ke pratinidhi hone ke naate, maharajyapal dwaara karyanvit karne ke liye baadhya hai
 Therefore, like other Commonwealth subjects, it is a parliamentary monarchy
 sansadeey shaasha hone ke naate, shaasha ke saare sanvaidhanik adhikaar, nishpaksh tathaa gaiyr-rajnatik kaaryon tak simit hai, jo saiddhanthik taur par shaasha ke adhikaar hai, parantu vaastavik rup se inhen keval governor-general dwaara hi upyog kiya jaataa he
 While political powers are exercised by the governor-general only on the advice and specifications of the government and its ministers
 adhyayan kii drushti se pashchimi darshan teen bhaagon main vibhakt kar sakate hai- 1
 Ancient philosophy 2
 madhyakaalin darshan 3
 Modern philosophy pracheen darshan main manushya kii buddhi ko prayek vishay par sochane kaa adhikaar tha
 In the medieval period, this right was challenged by Christianity
 madhyakaalin darshan kaa mukhya kaam vishwaas or buddhi ke daavon kii jaanch karnaa tha
 Faith claimed that an important part of truth is divine invention, whether it is understood by intelligence or not, it has to be believed
 aarambh main isai vichaarkon ne vishwaas or buddhi kii dharanaon ko abhinn sweekaar kiya
 After this, philosophy was given a secondary position rather than religion and made intellect a slave of faith; In the end, the intellect emphasized its authority and the areas of faith and intellect were separated
 wiliam durands ne kaha ki satya do prakaar kaa hota he- ek hi siddhant ek drushti se satya or duusari drushti se asaty ho saktaa he
 Medieval philosophy is predominantly the philosophy of scholarship
 aathvin shatee main iskaa aarambh hua; 11veen or 12veen shatiyon main iskaa vikaas hua; 13veen shatee iskaa yauvan kaal tha, 14veen or 15veen shatiyon main aantarik virodhon tathaa kuch bahari kaarnon ne ise samaapt kar diya
 Among the ideas that led to intense differences were the struggle of realism and nomenclature of philosophical outlook
 vaiyaktik sthiti main ham anek manushyon ko dekhte hai, iske atirikt manushya kaa pratyay bhi hamaara ek vichaar he
 What is the position of this suffix in power? According to realism, this suffix exists separately from particular humans; Special human beings are only incomplete copies of it or examples of it
 namawaad ke anusaar vaastavik satta vishesh manushyon kii he, "manushya" keval ek naam he, jo kuch samaantaaon ke aadhaar par ham kuch vyaktiyon main se har ek ko de dete hai
 In fact it was a quarrel of realism and realism
 isi se miltaa hua vivekwaad or anubhavvaad kaa matbhed tha
 For those who did not believe in the common, all knowledge was sensory knowledge
 is darshanik matbhed ne dharm main kai siddhanton kaa bhed khadaa kar diya
 The main topics of dispute were- insalm vidwat siddhant kaa sthaapak samajha jaataa he
 That device has a special place in the history of philosophy, which Anselm gave in favor of the existence of God
 kaant ne is yukti ko mana nahin, parantu kaha ki jo anya yuktiyaan di jaati hai, ve insalm kii yukti kii roopaantar hi hai
 The names of Thomas Aquinus and Duns Scotts are of special importance in medieval philosophy
 yatharthwaad or namawaad ke teevr vivaad main ve donon pakshon ke pramukh pravaktaa the
 Thomas Aquinus believed that certain fields of knowledge are subjects of faith; Even then, with the help of those basic rules, which are present in the active intellect of each one, knowledge can tell something about the nature of the world and God
 dans scotus kaa vichaar tha ki sara gyaan visheshon tak simit he; saamaanya pratyayon kaa astitv naam maatr he
 Okham, a worthy disciple of Duns Scotts, tried to succeed in the spread of nomenclature
 vidvadwad tark main itnaa ulajh gaya ki dharm se iskaa sambandh tut sa gaya
 "amendment" drew people of religious instinct
 dharm or darshan ke parthaky ne aadhunik darshan ke liye maarg khol diya
 In the modern period, human intelligence again started the work of independent deliberation with curiosity
 kuch logon ke vichaar main bekan ne iskaa marsanket kiya, parantu bahumat decort ko iskaa sthaapak maanata he
 The successful and failed controversy of philosophers inspired Decart to enter the certainty of mathematics in philosophy if possible
 uske baad spinoja or libniz kii bhi yahi bhaavana rahi
 In England, he turned to thinker psychology and made human intelligence a subject of research
 anubhavvaad ko lock, warkale or hum jaise pratham shrenee ke vichaarak mil gaye
 The rationalism of Continental thinkers and the empiricism of England reached two opposite directions as far as they could go
 ab germany darshanik vivechan kaa centre bana
 Kant sought to integrate rationalism and empiricism into criticalism
 hegal or shapenhavar ne pratyaywad ko aage badhaayaa
 The three main branches of this modern philosophy are: iske atirikt vishesh vishyon par bhi paryaapt vichaar hua
 decart started with occasional doubts
 turant hi use pataa laga ki yah andeh swayan andeh kaa vishay nahin ho saktaa
 His first suspicious realization was- adhik vichaar se vah is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki paramatma or bhautik jagat kaa astitv bhi vimal or spasht chintan kaa fal he or isliye asandigdh tathy hai
 All power is of two types - man and nature
 ye donon dravya hai - sarvatha ek duusare se bhinn
 The quality of man is consciousness, the quality of nature is expansion or spread
 in donon kaa bhed bhed kii paraakaashtha he
 Baruth Spinoza stated that infinity is inherent in the suffix of matter
 anant ek hi ho saktaa he, samgr hi akelaa dravya he
 Anant has infinite qualities, but man can only know about two qualities, contemplation and expansion
 chintan ke vividh aakaar aatma yaa jeev kehalaate hai; vistaar ke aakaar bhautik padaarth hai
 The two have no parallel of causality, only parallelism
 ekmaatr kaaran to samgr yaa ishwar hi he; manushya anivaaryta ke adheen hai
 Acceptance of inevitability is freedom
 udaaegon ko samajhnaa, unhen anand or prem ke shashan main karnaa yahi manushya kaa lakshya he, isi ko ishwarprem kehete hai
 Leibniz said that matter is not one, but one type
 usne moulik dravya ko chid bindu kaa spasht sampark kisi duusare chid bindu se nahin hota
 In the beginning, God created such harmony in them that the self-realization of each tells him what is happening in the souls of others
 ek nipun ghadi banane vaale kii banaai hui ghadiyaan ek duusare ko prabhavit nahin karatin, parantu sabhi ek hi samay dikhaati hai
 Decart adopted dualism, Spinoza adopted monotheism, and Leibniz adopted spiritual pluralism
 jaan lock ne apni vikhyath pustak "maanav buddhi par niabandh" ko sahaj, aprapt pratyayon kii asweekruti se aarambh kiya
 He said that in the beginning the mind of a human is like a blank plate, experience puts many kinds of thoughts on it
 in vichaaron main kuch samved ke rup main hote hai, kuch man ke chintan kaa fal hote hai
 There is another type of direct idea of matter
 man kuch gunon ko sanyukt paata he or unke sanyog ke aadhaar kii kalpana karata he, aise adhar ko dravya samajha jaataa he
 Some properties are present in material matter, some are understood in illusion
 akruti, pariman, thospan, gati pehle prakaar ke gun hai; rup, rang, ras, gandh, shabd hamaare baahar nahin, apitu hamaare andar hai ye kramash: pradhan or apradhan gun kehalaate hai
 The suffix of external material we make is not clear
 yah nahin jaanate ki vibhinn gun kaise sanyukt hote hai, na yah jaanate hai ki gunon ke samooh ke vishesh gun kaise baahar bah aate hai
 George Berkeley said that the forte is also a mental transformation, like the secondary child
 donon prakaar ke gunon ko chhod den to shesh asthul vichaar hi rah jaataa he or aise vichaaron kaa koi astitv nahin
 In this way, Berkeley supported materialism
 sari satta chetanon or unke vichaaron kii he
 Our perception, in large measure, is imposed on us; i don't decide what i will see when i open my eyes
 is bodh kaa kaaran paramatma kii kriya he
 This action occurs according to certain rules; These rules are named as Prakrit rules
 sari satta chetanon or unki chetnavasthaon se hi bani he
 There was still a leg up in empiricism, he picked up by David Hume
 hum ne kaha ki anubhav jo bodh hamen detaa he, ve sab ek duusare se pruthak hote hai, parantu unamem kisi prakaar kaa sambandh nahin hota
 We consider a group of properties that we have been seeing together
 yahi gyaata kii sthiti he, vah bhi chetan avasthaaon kaa samooh hi he
 Hume described the suffix of matter as a creation of emotion and imagination and supported the perception
 vigyaan kii neenv kaaran-kaary sambandh par he, hum ne anya sambandhon kii tarah, is sambandh ko kalpit bataaya or anubhavvaad ko ndehbaad main parinat kar diya
 Empiricism started with the assumption that all our knowledge is received from outside, Hume said that empiricalism has no possibility of definite knowledge
 emanuele kaant ne vivekwaad or anubhavvaad kii pruthak dhaaraon ko milakar unhen ek nadital par bahaane kaa ytn kiya
 He said that the raw material of knowledge is obtained from outside, the mind gives it the essential shape
 kaant kaa pratyaywad abhautikwaad na tha, uski dharna thi ki gyaan ke nirmaan main man kaa yogadan anivaary ansh he
 Sensations are received from outside, but they have to pass through the molds of the country and time and then they become combined knowledge
 desh or kaal maansik akritiyaan hai
 In making decisions based on the similarity and inequality of suffixes, the mind binds them to formulas of quality, magnitude, relationship and size
 kaant kaa pratham uddeshy vigyaan ko hyam ke akraman se bachaana tha
 For some time he accepted Hume's theory of causality
 peeche isi kii aalochana ko apana lakshya banaaya
 The existence of a cause-work relationship is unquestionable: the question is what is its basis
 kaant is vichaar main hum se sahamat he ki bahya ghatnaon main iskaa strot nahin
 He says that the intellect applies it to those events on its own behalf and transforms it into a system of absolute multiplicity
 gyaan grahan karnaa hi nahin, yah nirmaan he - man kii kriti iskaa moulik chinh he
 The "pure intellect" cannot go beyond the world of appearances; When she tries to leave, she gets involved in protests
 paroksh kaa gyaan, jaisaa bhi yah ho, vyaavhaarik buddhi kii dein he
 Man is essentially a moral being
 kartavyapaalan ke liye aavashyak he ki katrta main swadhin karm kii kshamta ho
 Our goal is complete achievement
 is anant lakshya kii siddhi ke liye anant kaal kii aavashyaktaa he
 The fruits of auspicious and inauspicious must be found, it is a demand of moral feeling
 iske liye paryaapt shakti kaa shaasha hona chahie
 Practical intelligence recognizes independence, immortality, and theism
 kaant ne kaha tha ki buddhi kii khoj abhas kii duniya main simit he, ise nirpeksh ke sabandh main vyarthan chintan nahin karnaa chahie
 Those who followed him did not accept his advice and made the absolutes the subject of his own discussion
 hegel ne kaha ki moulik satta "man" he
 The sequence of development in the external world is in contemplation - logic and philosophy are only one type of study
 ja kuch vivekaatmak he vah satya he, jo satya he, vah vivekaatmak he
 The fundamental fact of development is "opposition"
 jagat main prayek sthiti main uskaa virodh nihit hota he
 After this protest appears, coordination occurs in both situations
 chunki man is parivartan kaa aadhaar hota he, saamaanya rup main gati pragati hoti he
 In perception, every conception gives rise to conception and then the two are coordinated
 is samanvay main unche str se dikhaai detaa he ki dharna or pratidharana donon main satya tha, yadhyapi aanshik satya tha
 Many examples of this sequence are found in philosophical discussions
 vivekwaad ek dharna thi, isane anubhavvaad ke rup main pratidharana ko janm diya
 Kant coordinated both in his criticalism and stated that there is partial truth on both sides
 prayek samanvay nai dharna banataa he or nai pratidharana ko janm detaa he
 This sequence continues continuously
 raajnneeti ke sambadh main hegel is vyapak niyam ko bhul gaya or usne kaha ki prasha main raashtra ne apane antim aakaar ko praapt kar liya he
 But the speaker here was not the philosopher Hegel, but the indignant Hegel
 shapenhavar ne bhi moulik tatv kii khoj ko apana lakshya banaaya
 Like Hegel, he considered the mind to be such an element, but in the place of prudence or wisdom, he gave this resolution to the resolution - not to me or my own resolve, but to the larger resolution
 jad jagat main ye sankalp praakrit shakti ke vividh roopon main vyakt hota he, jaise aakarshan, garmi, prakaash, bijli aadi
 In the life of flora and fauna, it is expressed as an administrative power and takes the form of self-consciousness in humans
 manushya swabhaav se sukh kaa utpaadan karnaa chahta he, parantu jis sthiti main vah padaa he, usamen uskaa ytn vifal hota he
 The struggle of life itself creates infinite grief
 manushya ke liye uchit nahin he ki har prakaar kii ichha yaa aakanksha ko chhodkar tapasvi jivan vyateet kare or vastuon kii vyapak asarataa par manan kare
 Hegel considered prudence to be the core; He had to be optimistic
 andhe sankalp kaa multatv maananevaala shapenhavar aadhunik kaal kaa sabase bada abhadravaadi tha
 The discussion that took place after the middle of the 19th century, was usually in relation to specific subjects
 prastut vishay kii charchaa yahan sankethik rup se kii ja rahi he

 Fredrik Nietzsche - Revaluation of Moral Values 2
 herbert spencer or bergasaan- vikaswad 3
 Pearce and William James- Behaviorism nitshe- shapenhavar ne kaha tha ki sansar main andhe sankalp kaa shashan vyapak he
 Nietzsche stated that the highest aspiration for man is the 'aspiration for power'
 yoddha yuddh main vishwaas karata he; har ek yuddh ko saahas se ladaa jaae, apane uddeshy ko acha bana detaa he
 The policy of free men is very different from the policy of slaves
 isiyat ne namrata, karunaa, sahanubhuti, barabari ko sadachaar ke ansh bataakar das niti kaa prachaar kiya he
 Moral values must be re-evaluated
 balavaan vyaktiyon or jatiyon kaa kaam aage badhanaa he; jo rukaawat maarg main aae, use thokar lagaakar pare kar dena he
 It is in the benefit of the weak also to help the strong to become more powerful
 bakrii ke liye isse adhik bhagya kii vastu kya he ki vah sher ke sharir kaa ansh ban jaae? Herbert Spencer and Bergson - Herbert Spencer spread natural evolutionism
 prakruti or gati kaa pun: vitaran nirantar hota rahata he, ek manzil par jivan vyakt ho jaataa he or iske baad uchit samay par chetana prakat ho jaati he
 Bergsan said that motion is only a change, it does not have the ability to produce life
 prakruti kii gati main aavriti hoti he, nutanata nahin hoti or nutanata jivan kaa pramukh chinh he
 Nature is the ashes of life, the basic element of life-power
 bergasaan jivan or chetana ko sanyukt karata he, kahin-kahin to inhen abhinn maanata prathit hota he
 Bergsan named his major book "productive Development"
 is naam se hi pataa lagata he ki prakritik vikaswad se uskaa drushtikon kaise bhinn he
 Life is a continuous flow
 buddhi kaa kaam vyavhaar kii suvidha ke liye vastuon kaa todna phodna he; yah jivan ko uske vaastavik rup main dekh nahin sakati
 Antrajyoti sees life flow

 Kahaani is a genre of prose writing in Hindi
 unnisvin sadi main gadhy main ek nai vidha kaa vikaas hua jise kahani ke naam se janaa gaya
 In the bungalow it is called gulp
 kahani ne angreji se hindi tak kii yatra bangala ke madhyam se kii
 Kahaani is another distinction of prose fiction and more popular than fiction
 manushya ke janm ke saath hi saath kahani kaa bhi janm hua or kahani kahana tathaa sunanaa maanav kaa aadim swabhaav ban gaya
 For this reason stories are found in every civilized and uncivilized society
 hamaare desh main kahaniyon kii badi lambii or sampann parampara rahi he
 'yama-yami', 'pururava-urvashi', 'saupaniam-kadrav', 'santkumar-narada', 'gangavataran', 'shringa', 'nahusha', 'yayati', 'shakuntala' mentioned in the Vedas, Upanishads and Brahmins
 , Narratives like 'nal-damayanti' are ancient forms of the story itself
 prachinkaal main sadiyon tak prachlit veeron tathaa raajaaon ke shaury, prem, nyaay, gyaan, vairaygy, saahas, samudri yatra, agamya parvatiy pradeshon main praaniyon kaa astitv aadi kii kathaayen, jinaki kathanak ghatana pradhan hua karti thim, bhi kahani ke hi rup hai
 The "great story" of 'gunadhya', in which 'udayan', 'vasavadatta', the phenomenon of the might of sea merchants, princes and princesses, is the hallmark of the legend, can be called the oldest creation
 vrihatkatha kaa prabhaav 'dandi' ke "dashakumar charit", 'banbhatta' kii "kadambari", 'subandhu' kii "vaasavadatta", 'dhanpal' kii "tilkamanjari", 'somdev' ke "yashastilak" tathaa "maltimadhav", "abhigyaan shaakuntalam", "malvicagnimitra", "vicramorvasheey", "ratnavali", "mrichhakaticam" jaise anya kavyagranthon par saaf-saaf parilakshith hota he
 This was followed by the era of literary and artistic stories such as "panchatantra", "hitopadesh", "betal Pachisi", "throne Battisi", "shuk Saptati", "katha Saritsagar", "bhojprabandha"
 in kahaniyon se shrotaaon ko manoranjan ke saath hi saath niti kaa upadesh bhi praapt hota he
 Often stories have shown the victory of truth over untruth, justice over injustice and religion over wrongdoing
 america ke kavi-aalochak-kathakaar 'edgar elin po' ke anusaar kahani kii paribhaasha is prakaar haih "kahani vah choti aakhyanatmak rachana he, jise ek baithak main padhaa ja sake, jo pathak par ek samanvit prabhaav utpann karne ke liye likhi gai ho, jisamen us prabhaav ko utpann karne main sahaayak tatwon ke atirikt or kuch na ho or jo apane aap main purna ho
 "'premchand', who gave the best form of Hindi story, defines the story as follows:" The story is that of Dhrupad, in which the singer shows his perfect talent as soon as the Mahaphil starts, in a moment full of chivalry
 It does not happen as much as listening to the song overnight
 " hindi ke lekhakon main premchand pehle vyakti hai jinhone apane teen lekhon main kahani ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai – ‘kahani ek rachana he jisamen jivan ke kisi ek ang yaa kisi ek manobhaav ko pradarshit karnaa hi lekhak kaa uddeshy rahata he
 His character, his style, his narrative, all reinforce the same sentiment
 upanyaas kii bhanti usamen maanav-jivan kaa sampurna tathaa biihat rup dikhaane kaa prayaas nahin kiya jaataa
 It is not such a delightful garden in which the flowers are adorned with flowers, but rather a flowerpot in which the melody of the same plant is visible in its improved form
 ’ kahani kii or bhi paribhaashaayen uddhrut kii ja sakati hai
 But no literary genre can be tied to the scientific definition, because there is no surety of science in literature
 isliye uski jo bhi paribhaasha di jaaegi vah adhuri hogi
 The following elements are considered important in all types of stories to maintain interestingness, influence and proper connection between speaker and listener or storyteller and reader; plot, character or characterization, storytelling or dialogue, country or atmosphere, language style and an objective
 kahani ke dhaanche ko kathanak athwa kathavstu kaha jaataa he
 It is necessary to have a story for every story because in the absence of this, the creation of the story cannot be imagined
 kathanak ke chaar ang maane jate hai - armbh, aaroh, charam sthiti evam avaroh
 The story is handled by its characters and the character's faults are called their 'characterization'
 charitra chithran se vibhinn charitron main swaabhaaviktaa utpann kii jaati he
 Dialogues are a major part of the story
 inke dwaara paatro ke maansik antardvand evam anya manobhaavon ko prakat kiya jaataa he
 Deshkaal or atmosphere is used to convey the reality in the story
 prastutikaran ke dhang main kalaatmakataa laane ke liye usko alag-alag bhashaa va style se sajaayaa jaataa he
 The story has not only entertainment, but also has a definite purpose
 1910 se 1960 ke bich hindi kahani kaa vikaas jitani gati ke saath hua utani gati kisi anya saahitiyik vidha ke vikaas main nahin dekhi jaati
 The year 1900 to 1915 was the first phase of the development of Hindi story

 The cost of algae oil can be estimated as follows
 ek anumaan ke saath vaarshik biomas utpaadan kshamta main 10,000 ton kii vruddhi hui he
 This would reduce the cost of production per kilogram by $ 0
47 and $ 0
60 respectively

 It has set its goal of replacing up to 20% of transportation fuel by 2020, using environmentally and economically sustainable fuels from algae production
 iske alaava yah paaya gaya he ki shaiwal jaev eendhan laagat pratispardhi paaramparik eendhan ke saath hone ke liye puunji laagat, shram laagat or swayan ke dwaara parichaalan laagat bahut adhik hai
 As a result, new and cheaper solutions are being considered for algae exploitation
