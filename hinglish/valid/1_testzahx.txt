 In addition, eye disorders such as keratoconus and ancyconea cannot be cured with spectacles
 leonardo da vinci ko akasar kantact lainson kii kalpana ko prastut karne kaa shrey unki 1508 main prakashit kodex of da ai, minial di main karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 In which he described changing the strength of the cornea by immersing the eye in a bowl of water
 lekin leonardo ne yah salaah nahin di ki unki is kalpana ko drushti ke sudhaar ke kaam main laayaa jaae – unako to aankh ke samaayojan kii prakriya main adhik ruchi thi
 René Descartes introduced another idea in 1636, in which a test tube filled with fluid is placed in direct contact with the cornea
 iskaa ubhara hua sira drushti ko sudhaarney ke liye saaf kaanch kaa bana hua tha– lekin yah vichaar avyaavhaarik tha kyonki iske kaaran palak jhapakna asambhav tha
 In 1801, while conducting experiments related to the processes of adjustment, scientist Thomas Young created a fluid-filled i-cup that could be considered the ancestor of the contact lens
 ai-cap ke tal par yang ne micoscope kaa ek ipis lag diya
 But like Leonardo, Young's device was not designed to correct the defects of refraction

E
 Müller produced the first cover of a transparent and tolerable eye
 german chakshuvisheshgy adolf gastan uzen fik ne 1887 main pehle safal kantact lens kaa nirmaan or prayog kiya
 While working at Zurich, he described the creation and application of apocal scleral contact shells that stick to the less sensitive edges of the tissue around the cornea - initially on rabbits, then on their own and finally In on a small group of volunteers
 These lenses were made from heavy blown glass and were 18–21 mm in diameter
 fik ne cornia / kelacity ke or kaanch ke bich kii khaali jagah main dextros ghol bhar diya
 He published his work, contactbrill, in a journal, Archiv fur agneh Nahilkunde, in March 1888

 Agitated Müller in Kiel, Germany, improved his own near-vision in 1888 with a more convenient glass-blower scleral contact lens he had built
 1887 main hi lui je jirard ne kantact lens ke ek aise hi scleral prakaar kaa avishkaar kiya
 Glass-blown scleral lenses were the only type of contact lens until the 1930s, when polymethyl methacrylate evolved, making plastic scleral lenses possible for the first time
 1936 main, aptometrist wiliam fenbloom ne plastic lens prastut kiye, jo adhik halke or suvidhapurna the
 These lenses were made of glass and plastic
 1949 main pehle corneal lainson kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 These lenses were much smaller than the original scleral lenses, as they were applied only to the cornea instead of the entire surface of the eye and could be worn for sixteen hours per day

 The early corneal lenses were relatively expensive and brittle in the early 1950s and 1960s, which led to the development of a contact lens insurance market
 riplacement lens insorence, ink
 ne 1994 main kantacton ke saste or aasaani se badale ja sakane hone par apane mul utpaada ko band kiya
 One of the main inconveniences of PMMA lenses is that the conjunctiva and cornea do not get oxygen at all through the lens, which can have many side effects
 1970 ke dashak ke ant main or 1980 or 1990 ke dashakon main is samasya se nipatane ke liye oxygen pargamya lekin kadi vastuon kaa vikaas hua
 These were played by chemist Norman Gaylard in the development of permeable contact lenses
 Together, these polymers are known as hard gas permeable or RGP objects or lenses

 The main discoveries in soft lenses were made by Czech chemists Otto Viktorli and Drahoslav Lim, who published their work in a magazine called Nature in 1959 for the use of hydrophilic gel for bio-use
 iske baad 1960 ke dashak main kuch deshon main pehle narm lens uplabdh hue or yues food and drug administreshan ) ne saflence padaarth ko 1971 main pehali anumati di
 Due to the immediate comfort obtained from soft lenses, these lenses were written more quickly than rigid lenses - in comparison it takes some time to get complete comfort from rigid lenses

 Contact lenses are classified in different ways
 sudhaarak kantact lens drushti main sudhaar laane ke liye banaae jate hai
 In some people there is a disparity in the refractive power of the eye and the length of the eye causing a refraction error
 kantact lens is truti ko niskriy karke retina par prakaash ko sahi tarah se kendrit hone detaa he
 Diseases that can be cured by contact lenses include myopia, myopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia
 kantact pahanane vaale kantact ke brands yaa style ke anusaar roj raat ko yaa kuch dinon main ek baar apane kantact lainson ko nikaal kar rakhte hai
 Recently there has been renewed interest in arthrokeratology, in which the cornea is flattened overnight, leaving the eye without contact lenses or glasses during the day to correct myopia
 jin logon main rang ke vikaar hote hai unke liye laal-rang ke eks-krom kantact lens prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Although this lens does not bring back normal color vision, some colourants help people recognize colors better
 chromajen lainson kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or unamem raat ke samay drushti main kuch simaaen pai gai hai, haalanki anyathaa rangeen drushti main achachhaa sudhaar aata he

 These lenses can also improve vision, but there may be some blurring or obstruction of vision due to color or design
 uese main food and drug administreshan gaiyr-sudhaarak cosmetic lainson ko akasar sajaavati kantact lainson kii sangya detaa he
 Such lenses produce mild irritation at the time of applying, but are well tolerated after the eyes become accustomed to it
 kisi bhi kantact lens kii tarah, cosmetic lainson se bhi halki or gambhir jatiltaaon kaa jokham hota he, jinamein ankhon kaa laal ho janaa, kshobh or sankraman shaamil hai
 All people wearing a cosmetic lens are required to be under the supervision of an eye specialist to avoid complications of blindness
 theatre main prayukt kantact lens ek prakaar ke cosmetic kantact lens hote hai jo mukhyatah manoranjan udyog main akasar daraavnee or jombi filmon main ankhon ko asamanjas main or uttejk dikhaane, yaa unhen bhoot-numa, badali yaa jeevanheen dikhaane yaa pahanane vaale kii putliyon ko bada dikhaane, jisase lage ki pahanane vaala vibhinn tarah ke nashile padaarthon se prabhavit he, ke liye prayog main laae jate hai

 Cosmetic contact lenses can be dangerous for health
 narm lens akasar ankhon ke anavartaneey vikaron ke ilaaj or prabandhan ke liye prayog kiye jate hai
 The bandage contact lens protects the injured or patient cornea from constant rubbing of the eyelids, which helps it recover
 unka prayog bullas kerratopathy, shushk ankhon, corneal chhaalon or skhalan, cornia ke shoth, cornia kii sujan, dessemetocil, corneal actasis, murence ulcer, anterior corneal distrophy or neurotroffic kerratoconjuctivitis jaise rogon main kiya jaataa he
 Contact lenses that produce drugs in the eye have also been developed
 pehle kantact lens kaanch se banaae jate the, jo aankh main kshobh utpann karte the or lambii avadhiyon ke liye pahanane yogya nahin the
 But when William Fenbloom presented a lens made of polymethyl methacrylate, the contacts became much more convenient
 in piememe lainson ko aam taur par sakht lainso ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he 
 But PMMA lenses also have their own side effects
 lens main se cornia tak oxygen kaa sanchaar nahin hota, jisase kai avaanchit prabhaav ho sakate hai
 The late 1970s and the 1980s and 1990s saw the development of better hard materials - also oxygen permeable
 in polimaron ko samuhik rup se kade gas pargamya yaa arjipi vastuon yaa lainson kii sangya di gai he
 Tough lenses have an advantage, they do not absorb chemicals or smoke due to their pores
 Absorption of such compounds by other types of contacts can be a problem for those who typically face painting or other chemical processes

 aisa vibhinn chikitsakeey sthitiyon main kiya jaataa he, jab ek akelaa lens aavashyak drushti kshamta, lagane ke gun yaa aaraam pahunchane main asamarth ho
 Silicon hydrogels became available in 1999
 Silicon hydrogels have the highest oxygen permeability of silicon and the comfort and therapeutic functionality of conventional hydrogels
 ye lens pehle mukhyatah bade hue ke upyog ke liye diye jate the, haalanki aajkal din main pahane jane vaale silicon hydrogen sweekrut kiye gaye hai or bazaar main utaare gaye hai
 Silicon increases oxygen permeability as well as produces intense hydrotherapy in the surface of the lens and reduces its ability to damp
 isse akasar lens ko pahanane par takalif or shushkta utpann ho jaati he
 Hydrogels are added to deal with the hysteria, which makes the lenses humidified
 lekin, lens kii sataha phir bhi jal-santraasak rah sakati he
 Therefore, on some lenses, surface transformers are performed by plasma treatments that change the hydrological nature of the surface of the lens
 anya prakaar ke lainson main aantarik punarnamikaarak agent milakar lens kii sataha ko ardratagrahi banaaya jaataa he
 a third process is to increase the damping by reducing cross-linking by using longer surface polymer chains without altering the surface or adding additional agents
 dainik prayog vaale kantact lens ko sone ke pehle nikaal lenaa hota he
 Long-term contact lenses are designed to wear continuously throughout the night, usually for 6 or more consecutive nights
 nai vasteen, jaise silicon hydrogen unhen lagaataar 30 raaton tak pahanane ke upyukt bana sakate hai
 These long-wearing lenses are called continuous wear
 saadharantah akstanded vier lainson ko ek nishchit avadhi ke baad phenk diya jaataa he
 They are becoming more popular due to their convenience
 in lainson ko adhik samay tak isaliye pahana ja saktaa he kyonki unamem adhik oxygen pargamyata hoti he, jo aankh ko swasth banaae ankhti he
 Extended lens wearers are at a higher risk of cornea infection and ulcers - mainly due to inadequate care and cleaning of the lens, instability of the tear film and deposition of bacteria
 The corneal neoplasms have also historically been the common problem of using extended lenses, although this problem is not seen in silicon hydrogel extended wear
 The most common problem with extended lens use is conjunctivitis - usually allergenic or giant papillary necrrhealitis, sometimes caused by a poorly placed contact lens
 anek uplabdh narm kantact lainson ko unhen pratisthapit karne ke kaarykram ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 The shortest replacement program is a once-used lens, which is replaced every night
 pahanane ke samay tikaaupan kii kam aavashyaktaa ke kaaran kam pratisthaapak chakra vaale lens saadharantah patale or halke hote hai or isaliye apane varg or janareshan main sabase aaramdaayak hote hai
 These may be best for patients with eye allergies or other disorders, as they limit the accumulation of antigens and proteins
 ek baar prayog vaale lens un logon ke liye phydemand hai jo kantacton kaa prayog kabhi-kabhi karte hai yaa aise kaamon ke liye unka prayog karte hai jinamein unke gum ho jane kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Most lenses are recommended to be discarded after 2 weeks or a month
 tremasik or vaarshik lens jo pehle bahut lokapriy the ab prayog main nahin laae jate hai kyonki kam dar vaala kaarykram patale lainson or kam jamaav ko protsaahit karata he
 Rigid gas permeable lenses are very durable and last for many years without changing
 piememe sakht lens bhi bahut tikaoo hote hai or saamanytah 5 se 10 varshon tak pahane jate hai
 The interesting thing is that daily disposable lenses are also often made by the same company from the materials used to produce long-term lenses
 lainson main keval vyas yaa aadhaar vakrata main hi bhinnata hoti he
 a spherical contact lens is the lens whose optical surfaces inside and outside are part of the ball
 toric lens ke kii ek yaa donon satahon kaa prabhaav selindrical lens ke samaan hota he or yah saamanyatangolakaar lens ke prabhaav ke saath hota he
 Myopic and farsighted people who also have astigmatism and who are not suitable for regular contact lenses can use toric lenses
 yadi keval ek aankh main astigmatismo ho, to rogi ko ek aankh main golakaar lens or duusari main toric lens lagane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 Toric lenses are made from the same items used for regular contact lenses, but they have some additional properties: chashmon kii tarah, kantact lainson main bhi ek yaa adhik focal bindu ho sakate hai
 Multicentric contact lenses are almost always used to correct presbyopia or inadequacy of adjustment
 ekal drushti lainson ko monovijan naamak ek prakriya main bhi kaam me laayaa jaataa he
 a single vision lens corrects the vision of one eye and myopia
 vaikalpik rup se, koi vyakti duuradrushtita ke liye ekal drushti kantact lens or nikat drushti ke liye padhane ke chashme kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 Stiff gas permeable bicontinuous contact lenses typically have a small lens downstream to improve myopia
 jab ankhon ko padhane ke liye neeche kiya jaataa he, to yah lens drushti ke maarg main aa jaataa he
 In order to work properly, rgp's have to move in the vertical direction, so that the gaze gaze of the eye can be changed like binocular glasses to the farthest parts
 bahukendrik narm kantact lainson kaa utpaadan adhik kathin hota he or unhen lagane ke liye adhik kaushal kii jarurat hoti he
 All soft binocular lenses are called contemporary vision because correction of far and near vision is presented simultaneously on the retina regardless of where the eye is in any position
 beshak keval ek hi sudhaar sahi hota he or trutipurna sudhaar se dhundhalapan hota he
 Typically they are designed for correction of vision in the middle of the lens and correction of myopia on the periphery or vice versa
 aankh ke bheetar lagaae jane vaale lens, jinhen aropanyogy kantacch lens bhi kaha jaataa he, vishesh chote upachaarak lens hote hai jinhen shalya chikitsa se aankh ke pichley chambar main taare ke peeche or lens ke saamne adhik teevr nikat drushtita or dur drushtita ko thik karne ke liye aropit kiya jaataa he
 Most of the contact lenses are produced on a large scale

 Many people wear ordered lenses on the Internet
 united stats main, ferenes tu kantact lens kanjumar act jo 2004 main lagu hua, rogiyon ko kantact lainson ke nuskhe uplabdh karaane ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 By law, consumers have the right to get a copy of a contact lens prescription so that they can buy the lens from the shop of their choice
 Some controversy has arisen as to whether some online vendors are allowed to sell the lenses according to the prescription if the original recipe writer does not respond within 8 business hours as authentication messages are often sent at the time the business is closed for the recipe
 From which lenses can be made even on expired prescriptions

 Before touching contact lenses or eyes, it is necessary to wash hands with soaps that contain fragrance or allergens
 Soap should not be resistant to bacteria as it carries the risk of insufficient cleaning of hands and destruction of natural bacteria found on the eyes
 ye bacteria rogakaarak bacteria ko cornia main basane se rokte hai
 The technique of applying or removing a contact lens varies slightly according to whether the lens is soft or hard

 Disposable soft lenses, in particular, can cause problems - if the surface tension between the lens and the finger is too high, the lens may reverse, or it may double

 At such times, washing the eye can be beneficial but it should not be done more than a minute
 yah dhyaan dene kii baat he ki haalanki kuch tarah ke kantact lainson main yah saralata se maaloom ho jaataa he ki aapane lens ko ulti ore se laga liya he, aap lens kii sahi sthiti kaa pataa pehle hi laga sakate hai
 For this, place the lens on the tip of your finger and squeeze its lower part with two fingers of your other hand - you will know the exact position if the lens ends have turned inward like a taco
 If they turn outwards, you will need to flip the lens
 But in some types of glass it is difficult because they look the same from both sides
 kai lainson ko aankh main lagane ke baad bhi yah bataanaa kathin hota he ki ve unhen ulta lagaaya gaya he
 This happens because the sight and feeling on both sides of these lenses are the same
 is vajah se kai log yah koshish karte hai ki ve pehle din se hi apane kantact lainson ko donon ore se dekhakar pahchaan len taaki jab unhen lage ki lens ulta lag gaya he to ve kabhi bhi use sahi tarah se laga saken
 lainson ko kabhi bhi ulta nahin pahananaa chaiye bhale hi ve aaraamdeh lagate hon or unase spasht kyon na dikhataa ho
 The soft needle is pulled out by holding the eyelids open and holding the lens with two fingers
 is tareeke se kshobh ho saktaa he, aankh ko chot lag sakati he or kai baar aisa karnaa, palak ke jhapakane ke kaaran kathin ho saktaa he
 If the lens is pushed through the cornea, it can bend, allowing it to be easily caught
 vikalp ke choop main, ek baar lens ko cornia par se aankh ke bhitari kone kii ore khiskaa dene ke baad use upree palak ko ungali se neeche kii ore dabaakar baahar nikaala ja saktaa he
 This method reduces the risk of touching the eye with fingers and is an easy method for people with long fingernails
 kade kantact lainson ko bahari kone par ek ungali se khinch kar or phir palak jhapaka kar lens ke aasanjan ko kamjor karke nikaala ja saktaa he
 The other hand is placed like a cup under the eye to hold the lens
 lainson ko nikaalane ke liye kuch chote upkaran bhi uplabdh hai, jo lacheele plastic se bane chote musakon ke jaise hote hai
 The concave end is lifted to the eye and the lens is touched, making the seal between the lens and the cornea stronger than the seal and the lens comes out of the eye
 haalanki dainik dispojable lainson ko saaf karne kii jarurat nahin hoti he, anya prakaaron ko niyamit safai or visankramit karnaa aavashyak hota he taaki saaf dikhaai de sake or lens kii sataha par biophils banane vaale bacteria, kavak or ekainshmoeba sahit anek sookshmjeevanuon se utpann takalif or sankramanon kii rokthaam kii ja sake
 There are many products available that can be used for this purpose
 kuch utpaadanon kaa prayog keval kuch vishesh prakaar ke kantact lainson ke saath hi karnaa chaiye
 It is necessary to check the label of the production to see what type of lens it can be used with
 kantact lens ko saaf karne ke liye keval pani kaa prayog nahin karnaa chaiye kyonki pani lens ko puri tarah se visankramit nahin kar saktaa
 kantact lens ko saaf karne ke liye pani kaa istemaal karne se lens dooshit ho saktaa he or kabhi-kabhi isse aankh ko na thik hone vaali haani pahunch sakati he
 It is also important to follow the production instructions to prevent eye infection or irritation
 iske alaava, kantact ke dibbon yaa lens ko pani yaa bahuuddeshiy ghol yaa hydrogen paraksaide se acchhee tarah dhonaa nahin bhoolanaa chaiye taaki uski satahon par biophilmein na banane paaen
 It is necessary to make sure that the production is not contaminated with microorganisms
 in gholkon ke paatro ke siron kabhi bhi kisi sataha ke sampark main na aana chaiye or prayog main na hone par paatr ko band rakhana chaiye
 Thyomarsal, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol and other compounds are added as preservatives in some products to prevent mild contamination of the product and eliminate microorganisms present on the contact lens
 1989 main kantact lainson se hone vaali samasyaon main se kareeb 10% ke liye thyomarsaal ko jimmedaar paaya gaya
 Products without preservatives deteriorate quickly
 udaa

 In 1999, the selection of an appropriate disinfection solution became more important after silicon-hydrogel soft contact lens objects became available
 porvijan silicon hydrogen lainson ke saath alrgon ultracare visankraman system yaa uske kisi ghatak kaa kabhi prayog nahin karnaa chaiye
 a large part of current contact lens research is involved in the treatment and prevention of disorders arising from contamination of contact lenses and the building of foreign organisms
 chikitsakon dwaara aam taur par mana jaataa he ki kantact lens ke prayog kii sabase badi samasya jeevanujnya keretitis he or sabase aam sookshmjeevanu sudomonas airuginoja he
 Other bacteria are also the main cause of bacterial keratitis related to wearing of contact lenses, although their prevalence varies at different locations
 inamen anya jatiyon ke saath staphilokacal jati or stryptocokal jati shaamil hai
 Microbiological keratitis is a serious focal point in current research due to its severe effects, including blindness on the eye
 shodh kaa ek vishesh ruchikar vishay he, yah jaananaa ki sudomonas airuginoja jaise sookshmjeevanu kaise aankh main ghuste or use sankramit karte hai
 Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis has not been well understood, several different factors are being investigated
 kuch shodhakon ne dikhaaya he ki cornia main oxygen kii kami se sudomonas ke corneal bahyakala se sanyog, sookshmjeevanuon ke antareekaran tathaa shothakeey prakriya ke shuru hone ko badhaava miltaa he
 One way to reduce hypoxia is to increase the amount of oxygen the cornea receives
 haalanki silicon-hydrogen lens unki ati ucch oxygen pargamyata ke kaaran alpaxiyata ko lagbhag khatm kar dete hai, parmparik hydrogel narm kantact lainson kii apeksha ve bhi bacterial dooshan or corneal antahsancharan ke liye adhik prabhavi sthiti uplabdh karte lagate hai
 a recent study found that Pseudomonas aeruginoza and staphylococcal epidermis cling more strongly to silicon hydrogel contact lenses than conventional hydrogel contact lenses, and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginoza is 20 times stronger than staphylococcus epidermidis
 isse pataa chalata he ki sudomonas kaa sankraman sabase adhik kyon hota he
 Contact lens is another important part of research, patient acceptance
 Compatibility is a major issue associated with the use of contact lenses, because the lens and its cases are often contaminated when the patient is rejected
 bahuuddeshiy gholkon or dainik dispojable lainson kii uplabdhi se aparyaapt safai se utpann kuch samasyaon main kami ai he, lekin sookshmjivon ke dooshan ko rokane ke liye nae tareeke abhi viksit kiye ja rahe hai
 a silver-rich lens case is being made that can remove any contaminating microorganisms that come in contact with the lens case
 iske alaava kai sookshmjeev-pratirodhakon kaa vikaas kiya ja rahaa he jo swayan kantact lainson main pravishya kiye ja sakate hai
 Contact lenses containing selenium molecules have been shown to reduce the deposition of bacteria without harming the cornea of the rabbit eye, and contact lenses to a large extent reduce the adhesion of the actylglucoside bacteria used as surfactants
 ye yogic kantact lainson ke nirmaataaon or aptonetriston ko ruchikar lagate hai kyonki bacterial jamaav ke prabhaav ko prabhaavshaalee rup se rokane ke liye inke prayog ke liye rogi kii sweekruti kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Antivirus or anti-virus software, sometimes known as anti-malware software, is computer software used to detect, prevent, and remove malware software

 Signature-based research finds previously known types of data in executable code, although it is possible that a computer is affected by a new virus whose signature is not yet known
 aisi jiro-de rukaawaton ko dur karne ke liye huristicks takanic kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 One such heuristic technique, generic signature, involves mixing new viruses with the code of older viruses to catch changes in smaller code
 kuch antivyres software ek file kya karegi yah dekhne ke liye use sand-box mod main chalaa kar dekhte hai taaki bhavishya main ane vaali rukaawaton va samasyaon kaa saamana kiya ja sake

 After the completion of this book, these four brothers and sisters reached the nearby village of Alandi in Pune

 When Gyanadev left Alandi for the purpose of pilgrimage, he was accompanied by his brothers, sisters, grandmother, and many contemporary saints like Visova Khecher, Gora Kumhar etc

 Many works like 'dnyaneshwari', 'amritanubhav', 'changdev Pasathi' and 'abhang' written by Dnyaneshwar are well accepted
 kuch varsh purv yah siddhant upasthit kiya gaya tha ki gyaneshwari ke lekhak tathaa abhang ke rachayita, ek hi naam ke do bhinn vyakti hai
 But now it has been accepted by refuting this principle from many firm grounds that these creations are only of the person Saint Dnyaneshwar / Dhyaneshwar
 apane abhangon main gyaneshwar ne tatvacharchaa kii gaharaaiyon ko na napate hue adhikaar vaani se saadhaaran janata ko achardharm kii shiksha di he

 unki aadhyatmik sadhana kavyras se aplavit he, unki kavita ko darshan kii guru-gambhirtha mili he
 It is true that due to the disguise of Dnyaneshwar being like 'you-past', there have been visions of rasa-sources in it, however, his knowledge has been completed in Dnyaneshwari itself
 kavy ke donon angon, ras or alankaar kaa gyaneshwari main sundar samanvay he
 Like Dyanvichar and Kavyasoundarya, all the works that Dnyaneshwar did in the traditional life of Maharashtra were revolutionary
 un dinon karmkand kaa bolbalaa tha, samaaj kaa netritv karanevaali panditon kii parampara prabhaavaheen ho chuki thi
 In such a state, while establishing the importance of spiritual knowledge, Gyandev gave the assessment of devotional path of the common man
 panditon ke granthon tak simit rahanevaala aadhyatm darshan shudradikon ke liye bhi sahaj sulabh ho, ise dhyaan main rakhte hue' gyaneshwari' kii rachana kii gai
 Due to being born in a clan considered 'low', no matter how 'low' a person is considered socially, but God gives equal shelter to everyone, the credit for rendering this theory is to Dnyaneshwar
 maharashtra main inke granth gyaneshwari ko 'mouli' yaa mata bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the second sermon and assurance, at that time only a generation of Bhagavadhaktas were created in all the castes of Maharashtra and Marathi sentimental male and female started singing the glory of Lord Pandurang or Vitthal of Pandharpur in their own language

 That is why there is a shockwave attack on the soldiers, including the Autobots, who try unsuccessfully to steal fuel
 optimus maamle ke andeshe par chand ke gupt-abhiyaan par nikalataa he, jahaan autobats ke unako arq naamak yaan ke saath chirnishkriy centinal prime bhi miltaa he
 He is the predecessor of Optimus - who created a wonderful column of teleportation that allows the movement of time at two certain places to move smoothly between opposites without any physical barrier and convenience

 Finally, after getting an office job, one of his freaking coworkers, Jerry Wong, gives him secret foreknowledge of the arc, but Sam asks for a few extra things, like a machine vulture named Laserbeak killing him

 On the other hand, Sam freely interacts with the much-enriched ex-agent Semaar Simmons and discusses the mysterious murders of people involved in the arc-related space expedition by Megatrans and Decepticons
 phir do jivit roosi cosmonats dwaara dikhaai gai satellite tasveeron yah ujagar hota he ki vahaan saikadon stambh pehle maujuud the
 Sam realizes that the Decepticons removed the columns long before the Autobots left for the Ark campaign, then left the Sentinel and all five columns for the Autobots as a pre-plan - because only the Sentinel is the key to activate those columns
 And Decepticons needed him until he was revived through Optimus

 Sam now heads to Chicago to rescue Carly along with former Robert Robert Apes and his team, but the Autobots suddenly save their lives before the Decepticons kill them; And he himself explains the secret of escape in which he was separated from the rocket before being launched, which the decepticons kill and fall into misunderstanding

 But Gould recalibrates the controller-column before Sam's confrontation

 The enraged Sentinel now kills Optimus as well, with Carly already urging Megatron to stop the Sentinel to become the next Decepticons leader

 Megatron then threatens Optimus on the pretext of a cease-fire but Optimus dismisses Megatron to pieces

 Carly and Sam promise to be together after all the Decepticons are killed, while the Autobots also accept Earth as their home after the destruction of the planet Cybertron

 Gabbar is very angry when he loses to only two people and kills them all
 iske baad vah holi ke din gaanv par hamalaa karata he or ek lambi ladaai ke baad jai or veeru ko bandhak bana letaa he
 Thakur does not help them despite being in a position to help them both
 jai or veeru kisi tarah batch nikalate hai, or thakur kii is akarmanyata se kshubdh hokar gaanv chhodkar jane kaa man bana lete hai
 Thakur then tells them how he arrested Gabbar a few years ago but he escaped from jail and then to take revenge he first killed Thakur's entire family, and then cut both hands of Thakur

 While living in Ramgarh, Jai and Veeru slowly began to like the villagers

 Meanwhile, there are small squabbles between jai-veeru and Gabbar, and one day his men take Basanti and Veeru away

 The plan began when, about 6 months after the release of the Zanjeer film, salim-javed met GP Sippy and Ramesh Sippy, telling them the four-line story
 1973 se ve yah kahani kai nirmaataaon ko suna chuke the
 Two producers / directors also rejected his story completely

 According to its actual plan, the film had two ex-soldiers selected by a military officer to avenge the murder of his family
 baad main us sainya adhikari kii jagah ek pulisavaale ne le lee, kyonki sippi ko laga ki is tarah ke drishy dikhaane ke liye anumati milanaa kaaphi kathin rahegaa
 salim-javed completed the story together in a month
 isamen unke naam se lekar un logon ke taur tareeke tak shaamil the
 The screenplay and dialogues of the film are written in hindi-urdu, especially in Urdu only
 saleem-javed ne inhen multah urdu lipi main likhaa tha, or phir ek assistant ne inhen devanagari main anudit kiya, taaki hindi padhane waalon ko bhi ye samaj aaen

 sholay ke nirmaataaon ne shuruyaat main gabbar singh kii bhoomika hetu danni denjongpa ko chunaa tha, lekin ve is kirdaar hetu taiyaar nahin hue, kyonki vah pehle hi firoz khan kii dharmatma main kaam karne ke liye hami bhar chuke the, jiskaa filmakan samay bhi sholay ke samaan hi tha
 The second choice of the makers was Amjad Khan
 ve is kirdaar ko nibhaane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye or abhishpt chambal naamak ek pustak padhakar is charitra kii taiyaari karne lage
 This book, about Chambal's exploitation of dacoits, was written by his fellow artist Jaya Bhaduri's father Tarun Kumar Bhaduri

 Amitabh Bachchan did not become so famous at that time; He had to work hard to get this character
 saleem-javed ne haalanki 1973 main hi sholay ke liye bachchan ke naam kii sifarish kar di thi; kyonki zanjeer film main unke abhinay ko dekhakar hi saleem-javed aashwast ho gaye the ki bachchan is film ke liye sahi abhinayta hai
 Because many members of the film had already read the plot, many actors were willing to play different roles
 praan ko pehle thakur baldev singh ke kirdaar ke liye chunaa gaya, lekin sippi ko sanjeev kumaar is kirdaar hetu behatar lage
 salim-javed also spoke to Dilip Kumar for Thakur's character, but he made up his mind at that time; Dilip Kumar later admitted that this was one of the few films he regretted leaving

2:1 frem main parivartit kar diya gaya
 Regarding this process, Sippy said, "A 70mm format gives real enjoyment of the big screen and magnifies it further to make the picture even bigger, but since i wanted an even greater spread of sound, we Used 'six-track-stereophonic' sound and then combined it with a larger screen
 yah nishchit rup se ek vibhedak tha
 "the film's posters also emphasized the use of its 70 mm film, which was stylized to match the name of the film's Cinemascope logo
 film ke postaron ne sholay ko isse puraani anya filmon se alag karne kaa bhi kaam kiya; unamem se ek main to yah angreji tagaline bhi jodi gayi thi: "da greatest starcast evar asemblad - da greatest story evar told" In fact, the film that was shot at that time had a very different ending

 It gets a powerful engine and is somewhat track oriented but not to the extent that it affects its daily utility and comfort
 It was conceived as a car that its designers hoped would be considered the best car on the road
 Despite not being designed as a track machine, a modified race car version of the vehicle won several races including the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans where it faced off purpose-built prototype race cars
 iskaa utpaadan 1992 main shuru hua or 1998 main samaapt ho gaya
 Altogether 106 cars were produced, with some variations in design
 1994 main british car magazine autokaar ne ek sadak pareekshan main epa1 ke sandarbh main bataaya ki "saarvajanik sadak ke liye nirmit hone ke baavjood maclaren epa1 sabase badhiya driving mashin he

 Gordon Murray stressed that the engine of this car will be designed naturally to increase reliability and driver control
 Turbochargers and superchargers increase its power but they also increase its complexity and they can reduce reliability and at the same time introduce additional aspects of latency and loss of response thus retaining maximum control of the engine The efficiency of the driver decreases

 The normal mclaren F1 has no wing to produce downforce; However, in addition to the rear diffuser, the mclaren F1's overall design of the underbody uses a ground effect to improve downforce, which is further increased by using two electric Kevlar wings to reduce pressure under the car
 driver dwaara ek "ucch downforce mod" ko chaalu or band kiya ja saktaa he
 The engine has an air intake to guide high-pressure air, with a low-pressure exhaust point at the top of the vehicle's upper rear
 har daravaaje ke neeche ek chota air intech hota he jo tel kii tank or kuch electronix ko thanda karata he
 The flow of air generated by the electric fins not only increases the downforce, but the flow of the generated air is further absorbed through the design by directing it through the engine bay to provide additional cooling for the engine and the ECU
 is
 saamne kii taraf saamne ke brikon ko thandak pradaan karne ke liye ek kevalor electric chushan pankhe kii sahaayta ke liye nalikaayen hoti hai
 The rear of the vehicle has a small dynamic rear spoiler that will adjust the dynamic and automatic effort to balance the car's center of gravity while applying the brakes, which will move forward when the brakes are applied
 When the spoiler is activated, a high pressure area is created in front of the flap and this high pressure area is absorbed - the application exhibits two air intakes that allow high pressure air to enter the ducts
 Will allow the flow of air that will give way to the air to aid cooling of the rear brakes
 The spoiler increases the overall stretch coefficient from 0
32 to 0
39 and is activated at speeds equal to or greater than the brake line pressure
 40 mile / ghanta The design of the mclaren F1 machine's suspension system was attributed to Steve Randall, the car's dynamist

 Since inception, the F1 vehicle's design was most focused on bringing the mass of the car as far as possible into the middle by manipulating the interiors, engine, fuel, and the location of the driver, leading to a reduced inertia in removal
 Polar moments allowed
 The total weight of the front portion of F1 was 42% and the total weight of the rear part was 58%
 eendhan bharne se is aankade main 1% se bhi kam badlaav aata he
 The distance between the car's mass centroid and suspension roll center was kept the same as the distance between the front and rear of the car to avoid unwanted weight transfer effects

 Gordon Murray attempted to use carbon brakes for F1, but at the time he did not find the technology mature, the biggest drawback of which was the proportional relationship between the brake disc temperature and friction, ie stopping power, resulting in pre-use
 The brakes had relatively poor brake performance without initial heating

 vyaavhaarik taur par agar computer ko paribhaashit kiya jaye to ham hardware ko manushya kaa sharir or softver ko uski aatma kah sakate hai
 Hardware is the parts of a computer that we can see with our eyes, touch or work on them with tools

 Computer hardware are familiar with software or software are familiar with and based on computer hardware
 pehle ek kaary ke liye ek hi computer tantra hota tha or use yantrik str par kramadesh diye jate the jinhen badalanaa aarthik rup se nirarthak tha
 With the development of technology, making such machines became technically possible and economically profitable
 praarambhik computer tantro ko kramadesh dena bahut kathin tha kyonki us samay yah siddhant ki software bhi soochnaaon kaa ek samooh jo kisi yantransh kii smriti main surakshit rahe, praarambhik avasthaa main tha
 At that time, the instructions for the program given to a computer device were written directly on a simple instrument called 'punch card'
