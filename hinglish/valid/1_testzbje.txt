 Iranian painting: Iran is famous in the world for its carvings
 yah irani vastron, minaakaari chaukon or chitron kaa adhyayan se spasht ho jaataa he
 Carpets made in Iran are famous for the alternation of balance and ornamentation of colors and the main motifs of ancient art there are geometric and animalistic
 hakhmani yug kii irani kala par asuriya kaa prabhaav spasht he, par sasaani yug se irani kala apana ek nijasav rakhti he
 The balance of Iranian art in planning and painting is self-contained despite the Arab, Mongol and Taimuri campaigns
 manikhi chitrit pustakon ke jo ansh nasht hone se batch gaye hai unase pataa chalata he ki us kala kaa muslim yug kii aarambhik kala se sidhaa sambandh he
 The construction of the idol in Iran was also stopped by the order of Islam, but with the victory of the Arabs, the relationship of that country increased with other countries and many international influences in the field of art also had its art
 asia par mongol vijay ke baad sudur purv kaa rasta khul gaya or irani kala par chini kala kaa prabhaav spasht reeti se padane laga
 In the Taimuri Sultans, there was a race to collect the best painters in their court
 is videshi satta kaa prabhaav iran ke janajivan par acha nahin padaa; phir bhi yah ajeeb baat he ki in videshiyon ke adheen irani kala kii aashaatheet unnati hui, jo iran ke rashtriya shah safaviyon ke samay main ruk si gai
 This may be the reason that as long as there was life in the country, art and war went on simultaneously, but the signs of deterioration along with the unity of power were clearly visible
 aarambhik yug main irani kala kaa sambandh manikhi dharm se tha par 290 i
 main us dharm ke sansthaapak mani, jo chitrakaar bhi the, maar daale gaye or unki chitrit pustaken jala di gayi
 But art does not die from all these events
 muslim yug ke aarambhik kaal main dharm se kala kaa sambandh tut gaya par kuch chitrakaar raison or sultaanon ke aashray main apni kalasaadhana karte rahe
 This was also possible because in this era, the material of paintings, ie the bright colors, gold and paper were so expensive that only Rajashrishta painters could use them
 chitron ko sundartaapurvak banane main bhi itani mehnat padati thi ki saadhaaran jan unka mehtaanaa bharne main asamarth the
 Iranian painting is famous for the strength of lines and peacock shape, lacks the shadow and the face texture is shown in three fourths of the eye
 sharir kaa adhik bhaag dhakaa hone se uski visheshta dikhalaane ke praytn kaa abhaav dikh padataa he
 The background of these paintings is guided by the brilliance of the sun and the flowering trees, hills and flowing ravines are marked in the sare
 irani chitrakala kaa asli itihaas abbasi yug se aarambh hota he
 Painted books of this era were written in Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasids
 isamen andeh nahin ki is chitrakala ke parivardhan main iraniyon kaa bada haath tha, par usamen purv ke isai chitrakaaron kii kaarigari bhi spasht he
 Initially there was a need to delineate the texts of Vaidyak, Astrology and Physics
 is varg kii chitrit pustaken adhiktar 12veen sadi kii hai
 Among these were books depicting zodiac signs and hydraulics, among which al-zazri wrote mechanics and the Dioscarides are the main ones
 ek ullekhanayi baat yah he ki diyoskarides kii chitrit pustakon main vanaspatiyon ke chitra to unani dhang ke hai par maanav aakaara kaa ankan, rangayojna or veshbhusha manikhi chitron or bijantaanaa kuttamit bhoomi kii yaad dilaate hai
 Raiso is credited for writing and illustrating these scientific books, but the credit of Ibn Mukaffa's Kalola and Dimna and Harari's work is depicted to others
 pehali pustak sanskrit ke panchatantr kaa anuwaad he or duusari main abuzaid ke chaturaai bhare karnaamon ke kisse hai
 All the handwritten copies of these books that have survived show that even in the simplicity, there is life in their lines
 vaise unke rang saadhaaran hai
 His paintings throw considerable light on 12th century Arab life
 kuch vidwaanon ne yah bhi sujhaayaa he ki inamen se kuch pustaken shaayad mahmud gazanvi ke rajyakaal main gazani main likhi gai kyonki vahaan firdausi ne shahnamaa likhakar iran kii pracheen vibhuti ko pun: jagaarit kiya tha
 But this notion is unmistakable
 thik baat to yah he ki 12veen sadi kii abbasi kala kaa iraq or iran main ek hi rup tha
 It is a strange event in the history of Iran that Mongol expeditions also gave great impetus to art by destroying its culture and economy
 14veen sadi jis tarah irani kavy kaa swarnyug he usee tarah chitrakala kaa bhi
 Painting progress was achieved in the era of Timur's descendants, but his progress was halted in the Safavi era
 14veen sadi kii irani chitrakala ko mongol style kala gaya he, kyonki usamen mongolon kii akritiyon, veshbhusha or rahan sahan kaa chithran he
 But the reality is that this new style originated in China and this style gave a new direction to the Iranian style
 pushapakshiyon tathaa vrikshon ke ankan main naveenta is style kii visheshta he
 Renowned minister and historian Rashiduddin built a suburb outside Tabriz and placed many painters to illustrate his books there
 1306 or 1312 ke bich bane jamiuttavaarikh ke chitron se pataa chalata he ki unamem bible, mohammad ke jivan or buddha ghatnaon ke ankan bhinn-bhinn shaileyon ke dyotak hai
 Chinese influence is evident in Mongol history paintings
 rashiduddin kii mrityu ke baad arab sahitya kii anek pustakon kaa chithran, jinamein dameet kii shahnamaa bhi he, shailigat aadhaaron par shaayad 1330 main hua
 It is known from its pictures that in this era Iranian style was gradually establishing its own self
 1381 or 1392 ke bich iran par taimur ke khooni akraman hue
 With them, China's influence on Iranian culture increased
 taimur ne samarkand main bahut se kalakaar ikatthe kar liye the jisase kala kii unnati main koi avrodh nahin padaa
 The paintings of the Taimuri era are more elaborate than the early paintings
 jameen or aasmaan dikhalaane kii pratha, bhinn-bhinn khandon main akritiyon or ghatnaon kaa pradarshan tathaa saiyr kii vaastavik ankan is style kii visheshtaayen hai
 The paintings of Shahnama, Lailamjanun, Kazwani's tithi-e-guzaida, Iskandarnama, etc
 reveal the style of paintings of the early Timuri era
 shahrukh kii mrityu ke baad us samay kala or sahitya ke prasiddh unnayakon main haraat ke sultan hossain bekaraa kaa naam aata he
 In fact, the founder of the beatari style was Sultan Hussain's minister Ali Shore Nawai
 chitron kii maang hone se bahut se chitrakaar heraat main ikattha ho gaye, jinamein bihzaad kaa sthaan mukhya tha
 The painters of Herat called for the prevailing Iranian style by not running any new style
 bihzaad kii kala ke bare main abhaagyavash vidwaanon main mataiky nahin he
 Whether or not the paintings of Bihzad are considered to be his works or not, some scholars have come to the conclusion after much research that they were unmatched in color planning and drafting of Saira and war drawing was their specialty
 safaavi yug iran kii chitrakala kaa rashtriya yug kaha ja saktaa he
 The Safawi-style approach was towards conservatism
 is yug ke pehle hi irani style kaaphi manj chuki thi isliye chitrakaaron ne isamen koi naveenta laane kii aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi
 Now his attention shifted from all sides to drafting and compilation
 firdausi, nijaami or saadi ke kaavyon ke chithran kii maang bad gai thi
 Shah Safawi was from Iran, so some ancient stereotypes can be expected in his pen; But in reality, the mark of this stereotype is rarely found in painting
 tahmaspakaleen chitron main pashupakshiyon se alankrita haashie kii pratha chal padi
 The painters' attention shifted from the princely scenes to the sometimes rustic world
 tatkaaleen veshbhusha or rasm rivaaj ke adhyayan ke liye ye chitra apni vasheshta rakhte hai
 Among the famous painters can be named Mir Mir Sayyid Ali, Mirq and Sultan Muhammad, who were famous in their depiction of animals
 shah tahmasp ke antim dinon main irani chitrakaar dhire-dhire pustakachitran kii pracheen pratha se vilag hone lage tathaa achche chitrakaar shaboh banane or vanabhojan ityadi ke ankan main lag gaye
 The art of painting and the disconnection of the clerical took a new form, which resulted in imitation of Shabeeha in Iranian clothing
 baad kii safaavi chitrakala pustak aalekhan se bilkul alag ho gai par saath hi saath vah rudhigat bhi hoti gai
 Painter Syahkalam started drawing and his demand increased in public due to cheap prices
 is style ke acharya riza abbasi maane gaye hai jo shah abbaas pratham ke samakaleen the
 European art also had European influence in the 17th century, but that influence was limited
 alankaran main europea chitron se kuch ansh nakal karke unke chaaron ore irani drishy or akritiyaan bhar di jaati thim
 After Shah Abbas II, Iranian art began to decline gradually and painters began to spend time copying old painted books or making Sihakalam photographs
 19veen sadi main to europe se prabhavit irani chitrakala kii apni koi hasti nahin rah jaati
 Iranian calligraphy - Writing art has been a symbol of Iran's national sentiment and feeling for nearly two thousand years
 madhya yug main sulekhankala chitrakaari tathaa nakkashi kii kalaon kaa mukhya ang ban gai
 Painting and calligraphy became a choli as well, with many Iranian painters practicing calligraphy before learning their art

 There were 24 different scripts at the end of the 19th century
 jinamein rayaasi, jiske teraa bhed the, mukhya thi
 The originator of this script was an Iranian
 10veen sadi kii irani sulipi ke udhaaharan kam milte hai or jo milte bhi hai unamem kufi lipi kii bahulata pai jaati he, phir bhi irani style main apana nijasav miltaa he
 The Muraq and Ups and Ups of the Kufi script are ornate in importance and its singularity was used by the Iranians in their own way
 par iskaa yah arth nahin ki sidhi saadi, par sundar lipi kaa upyog 11veen sadi main nahin hota tha
 In the era of the establishment of the Selujak empire, many ways of writing the script were present in front of the clerics, but they all had the objective that whatever the content of the articles, their beauty should be attractive and the decoration of the letters should take the form of carving together
 in lipiyon main kufi kaa mukhya sthaan tha par 12veen sadi ke ant main naskhi lekhanvidhi kaa prarambh hua
 The special feature of this writing method was that it removed the solidification of the Kufi script and replaced the delicate peacock pieces
 sulls lipi kaa uddeshy aksharon ke badhaav chadhaav se alankarita badhanaa tha
 The competition for happiness increased in this era
 12veen sadi ke prasiddh khushqatanvis nazmuddin abubakr mohammad kaa kahana he ki use 70 lipiyon ko alankarik dhang se likhane kaa abhyaas tha
 He also wrote a book on Khushkati which describes the writing style of the Naskhi, Sules, Rika and Muhqq scripts
 sultan tugril ne swayan khushqati kii shiksha paakar apane haathon se quran kii do pratilipiyaan kin
 In the 14th century, happiness was further enhanced and nasti and kufi were used to decorate mosques

 Kashan remained the principal center of the Khushkat Navisi in the Mongol era
 nastalik lipi ke parivardhan se temuri yug ko ham irani khushqatanvisi kaa swarnyug kah sakate hai
 Amir Badruddin, a minister from Timur, himself was a Khushkatnavis and the Sultan's grandsons Ibrahim Mirza and Waisungur were adept at this fun

 It contains visions of a culture that is still in Iranian script

 In Sanskrit literature, the Natya Shastra of Bharata presents mostly classifications of dramatic characters, and Vatsyayana's Kamasutra reveals distinct distinctions that often relate to the sex trade of men and women
 "agnipurana" main pratham baar nayak-nayika kaa vivechan shringaar ras ke alamban vibhaavon ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Later writers of Sanskrit and Hindi have extended the subject within the boundaries of Shringaaras, accepting the status of "agnipuran"
 in simaaon kaa, jinka atikaraman keval apwaad ke rup main kiya gaya he, is prakaar samajha ja saktaa he: Bharata has made four distinctions of the hero: dheerelit, dheerprantha, dheerodatta, dheerodhata
 ye bhed naatak ke nayak ke hai
 In addition to these, "agnipuran" mentions four more distinctions: sangatha, darshan, shash, dhrishta
 ye bhed spasht hi shringaar ras ke alamban vibhaav ke hai
 Bhoj has mentioned several other classifications in addition to these two in "saraswati Kantabharan" and "shringarprakash"
 kintu unamem se keval ek vargeekaran hi, jiskaa ullekh purush ke bhedon ke rup main bharat ne bhi kiya tha, parvarti lekhakon ko maanya hua : uttam, madhyam, adham

 pati, upapati, vaishik ko mukhya vargeekaran maanakar anukool, dakshin, shath, ghrishth bhedon ko pati ke antargat rakhaa he 
 Only a few writers in Hindi have accepted the exquisite, medium, unbearable distinction of the hero, among whom Sundar, Cannon and Rasleen are prominent
 nayak ke kuch anya bhed is prakaar hai : proshit, maani, chatur, anbhigya
 Acceptance has two distinctions: metaphorical, virtuous

 When any anti-law or anti-social act is done by a child, it is called juvenile crime or child crime

 According to the Juvenile Justice Act 1986 in India, boys and girls up to 18 years of age have been included in the category of juvenile delinquency
 bal aparaadh kii adhiktam aayu seemaa alag-alag rajyon me alag-alag he
 On this basis, anti-legal work done by a child under the age limit set by any state is child crime
 keval aayu hi bal aparaadh ko nirdhaarit nahin karti varan isamen aparaadh kii gambhirtha bhi mahatvapurn paksh he
 No crime has been committed by a 7 to 16 year old boy and a girl between 7 and 18 years of age, for which the state gives death penalty or life imprisonment such as murder, treason, fatal attack etc
, then it will be considered as a child criminal
 samajashastreey drushtikon se bal aparaadh ke liye aayu ko adhik mahatv nahin diya jaataa kyonki vyakti kii maansik evam saamaajik paripakvata sadaa hi aayu se prabhavit nahin hoti, atah kuch vidwaan, balak dwaara prakat vyavhaar pravriti ko bal aparaadh ke liye aadhaar maanate hai, jaise aawaragardee karnaa, skool se anupasthit rahanaa, mata-pita evam sangrakshakon kii ajna na maananaa, ashleel bhashaa kaa prayog karnaa, charitraheen vyaktiyon se sampark rakhana aadi
 But until a valid method is unanimously accepted, age will be considered as the determinant of child crime
 gilin evam gilin ke anusaar samajashastreey drushtikon se ek bal apradhi vah vyakti he jiske vyavhaar ko samaaj apane liye hanikaarak samajhataa he or isliye vah uske dwaara nishiddh hota he
 In this way, child crime is taken against the antisocial behavior of children or the behavior of children which is detrimental to public welfare, is known as child criminal
 robinsan ke anusaar aawaragardee, bheekh maanganaa, niruddeshy idhar-udar ghoomana, udandta bal apradhi ke lakshan he
 On the basis of the above definitions, a child who disobeys the law and conducts anti-social behavior is a child criminal, as Newmeyer states that a child criminal is a person under a certain age who has done a criminal act and whose abuse is breaking the law

 Audits have revealed the fact that the most serious and serious offenders are adolescent boys

 The nature of Cashore offenses is different from that of ordinary offenses
 kanoonee shabdaawalee main desh ke nirdhaarit kanoonon ke viruddh aacharan karnaa aparaadh he, kintu kaishor aparaadh samajashasreey evam manovaigyanik pratyay he
 All the behavior done by adolescent boys, which is not only legal but detrimental to society and individual in any way, comes under the purview of Cashore crime
 yatha---vidhyalay se bhaagna kanoonee drushti se aparaadh nahin he, kintu saamaajik evam manovaigyanik drushti se hanikar he
 On the one hand, it teaches to run away from all kinds of responsibilities and on the other hand, the child is removed from proper work and motivated to do wrong things
 is prakaar kaishor aparaadh kaa kshetra adhik vyapak he
 In adolescence, environment is very much involved in the formation of personality and behavior; Therefore, the adolescent child is responsible not for his proper or inappropriate behavior, but his environment
 is kaaran anek deshon main kaishor aparaadhon kaa alag nyaayavidhan he; unke nyaayadhish evam anya nyaayadhikari baalamanovigyaan ke jaankaar hote he
 There child-criminals are not punished, but instead of studying them and their environment on the basis of their biography, they try to improve the children by improving the unsatisfactory elements in the environment, which ultimately give rise to crimes
 apradhi bacchon ke prati sahanubhuti, prem, dayaa or samvednaa kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 In India also, balanayalayas and child improvement homes have been established in some states

 Anthropologists have concluded that crime is related to inheritance, physical structure and caste characteristics
 isi kaaran apradhi jati ke sabhi vyakti ek hi jatigat visheshtaon or ek si shaareerik banaavat ke hote hai tathaa ve ek sa aparaadh karte hai
 The opinion of physicists is similar to this
 unke matanusaar vishesh prakaar kii shaareerik banaavat or prakriyanvaala vyakti vishesh prakaar kaa aparaadh karegaa
 But psychology has proven that crime is neither related to succession nor to physical structure; Only physical characteristics are attained in succession, they are not directly related to the feelings, aspirations, tendencies and intelligence of the person
 samajashasreiyon kaa kathan he ki aparaadh kaa janmdata dooshit vaataavaran, yatha---garibi, ujde parivaar, apradhi saathi aadi he
 But it has been known by modern psychological researches that not only in the same environment but in the same family, half of the children of the same parents are criminals, not all
 yadi aparaadh kaa janmdata vaataavaran hota he to anya bhai bahinon ko bhi apradhi bananaa chahie
 Modern psychology finds the origins of Cashore crimes in psychological situations

 uske is prayaas main anek baadhaayen aati hai, jinhen vah jeetne kaa praytn karata he
 With the results of his efforts, he is either satisfied or dissatisfied or indifferent
 kintu udaseenta ke bhav kam hi ho pate he
 Satisfaction and dissatisfaction are not related to success or achievement, but satisfaction is a relative suffix
 nirdhan kisaan apni sthiti main santusht rah saktaa he; kintu karodpati vyavsaayee nahin
 It is human nature to try to overcome dissatisfaction
 ise dur karne ke samaaj dwaara sweekrut dhang jab asafal ho jate he tab vyakti aisa dhang apanaataa he jo safal ho, bhale hi vah samaaj ke liye hanikar or uske dwaara asweekrut hi kyon na ho
 Only then does he become a criminal

 The question is of the amount of satisfaction and dissatisfaction
 nishkarsh yah ki baccha chaahe shaareerik kamajori se peedit ho, uski buddhi kam ho, uske mata pita apradhi hon, uskaa vaataavaran kharaab ho, usee uplabdhiyaan nimna str kii hon, phir bhi vah tab tak apradhi nahin banegaa, jab tak ki vah apni sthiti se asantusht na ho or asantosh ko dur karne ke uske samajaswikrut prayaas asafal na ho chuke hon
 Crime is a type of self-propagation and behavior
 kishor avasthaa ke aparaadh bhi swaabhaavik vyavhaar ke dhang hai, keval unka parinaam samaaj tathaa vyakti ke liye ahitkar hota he
 Therefore, in order to save the society from this pernicious situation, parents and teachers, with the help of psychologists, will have to see what unsatisfactory conditions exist due to the child's criminal conduct

 Bandura and Walterm compared the acts of white juvenile offenders to non-conspecific boys with no clear signs of economic hardship, and found that criminals differed slightly from nonpharmacies in terms of relationships with their mothers, but with their fathers

 Thrasher Shaw and mckay's studies also point to a similar type of juvenile crime, mainly because the young man became a criminal because he already lived in the company of criminals, later Sutherland made this fact clear

 Parents have a direct impact on the child's development and ingrowth

 Similarly, defective discipline is also a factor responsible for child crime, the dominant approach to discipline also affects the child's friend group relationships because the child will not be able to behave freely with his peers
 Second, and meek discipline to direct the child's behavior
 Inappropriate or biased discipline will not provide necessary control for the child
 Fails to develop emotion

 paariwarik kaarnon ke atirikt swany vyakti main hi aisi kamiyaan ho sakati he jinase ki vah apradhi vyavhaar ko prakat karen
 Physical factors: When a child is suffering from any type of physical disability, a sense of inferiority develops in them, they become prone to crime, Cyril, Burt, Heale and Broner and Gluc etc
 found this in studies of child criminals
 , Hattan has considered many types of physical defects such as deafness, permanent disease, physical disability, lack of intelligence as the cause of child crime
 manouvaigyanikon ne maansik asamantaaon ko bhi bal aparaadh ke liye uttaradaayi mana hai, maansik kaarnon main do kaarak mahatvapurn hai Goddard, Heale and Broner etc
 found that child criminals are mentally retarded by studies, Clash and Chaso published their article "the relation between morality and intellect" in Columbia University in 1935, which showed that people with weak brain Families were more inclined towards crime, due to mental backwardness they lack reasoning power

 Matja believes that a person is neither fully independent nor fully controlled, but Bahwa is somewhere in the middle of freedom and control, so the young man flows between the criminal and the traditional action, although most of the young man's actions are in accordance with the law

 Mr

 chaakmay kalp yaa khati kalp yaa criteshas kalp prithvi ke madhyajivi mahakalp kaa ek kalp he
 It started about 14
5 million years ago and lasted till about 65 million years ago
 is se pehle jurysik kalp chal rahaa tha or iske ant ke saath-saath madhyajivi mahakalp kaa bhi ant hua or nutanjivi mahakalp ke pehle kalp, peliosin kalp, kaa armbh hua
 The Paleocene eon and the Chalcaye eon contained a cretaceous-paleogene extinction event over time, killing many of the Earth's fauna, including the dinosaur, and allowing mammals to emerge
 bhuvaigyanik samay-maan ke anusaar prithvi kaa madhyajivi mahakalp teen bhaagon main vibhajit he jisamen chaakmay kalp sabase naveen he
 This era was named by Homeliumus de Halva in 1822 AD from the origin of the Latin word krita
 crita kaa arth he - 'khadiya', jo is yug kii shilaon main bahutayat se milti he
 The Chakmay begins after the Mahasrat era
 in donon yugon ke madhya kisi prakaar kii asamrupata nahin he, jisase vidit hota he ki is yug ke pehle prithvi kii bhaumik dasha main koi vishesh parivartan nahin hua
 In contrast, in the afternoon of this era, there have been many changes in the earth which have a substantial impact on the earth's crust
 yahi kaaran he ki chaakmay kalp ke nikshepon ke samaan vibhinnata anya kisi yug main nahin pai jaati
 Chakamay Kalpa's beds are found in many places in the world, which are main in Europe, North Africa, Australia, India, North China and America
 in sanstaron main khadiya mitti, chuunaa pathar, baaluu kaa pathar or cong lomaret vishesh hai
 Among the fossils of the Chakamaye kalpa, the genus Phryngia, the Phylum species, Phytocrhagati and Corals are of special importance, although the Bahupadas, Falakklom, Cauliflower and Sponges are also found in abundance

 a brief description of the Chakmayi strata of different places and the co-equilibrium configuration is given
 bharatvarsh main is yug kaa pradurbhaav mahasarat yug ke spity shells ke uparaant hua tha
 On the basis of origin, the group of rock formations of this institution is divided into five types: the first class is those of the geodronic deposits that extend from the Spiti region of the Himalayas to Kumayu, Garhwal and Nepal
 kashmir ke chaakmay kalp ke sanstar bhi isi varg main aate hai
 Second, the continental deposit which is found in the Salt Range, Sindh and Baluchistan
 teesraa samudri utthan se bane sanstar, jo narmada nadi kii ghati main gwalior se baagh tak or bharat ke purvi kinaaron par, mukhyat: trichanapalli main milte hai
 The fourth category is of axial waters, which are known as the Lametta rock group in Madhya Pradesh and Jabalpur
 paanchaven varg main ve aagney shilaayein aati he jo dakshin sopanashm ke antargat hai or bombai, hyderabad, madhyapradesh or gujarat se lekar bihar tak faili hai
 The geomagnetic deposits of India are divided into two parts: the sandstone found below, called the Geumal rocks and the rocks found above it, known as the Chikkam group

 His major compositions are as follows: adhik taap ke kaaran utpann aavesh-vaahakon kaa kisi sataha se yaa kisi sthitij-urja barier ke viruddh pravaah tapayanic utsarjan kehalaata he
 Almost everyone is aware that electrical conductivity in metals is due to the motion of independent electrons
 swatantra electranon se hamaara abhipraay un electranon se he jinka anya kisi anu athwa parmaanu se sambandh nahin hota
 But these electrons cannot interfere with the surface of the metal, because the surface of the metal has the same force as gravity
 dharaatal ko paar karne ke liye electron ko utana kaary karnaa padataa he jitna unhen gurutvkarshan ke samaan is bal ko paar karne main lagata he
 This implies that the kinetic energy of these electrons must be so high that they can cross this surface force of the conductor
 saadhaaran taap par electron kii gatij urja itani adhik nahin hoti ki ve bina kisi bahya urja kii sahaayta ke dhaatu ke dharaatal ke baahar aa saken
 This external energy can be found in the form of emergency radiation or obtained by extremely moving particles that hit the surface of these metals
 parantu yadi kisi prakaar chaalak kaa taap badha diya jaae, jisase swatantra electranon ko utani urja mil sake jitani unako dhaatu ke dharaatal se baahar laane ke liye aavashyak he to vah kriya ho jaati he jise tapayanic utsarjan kehete hai
 The number of electrons emitted from each unit of surface area can be represented by the following equation: jisamen j = stream flowing from unit area t = us padaarth kaa nirpeksh taap jo electron utsarjit karata he; w = the work volume that is equal to the work of an electron that has to come out of the surface of the metal
 a = niyatank jo utsarjak ke gunon par nirbhar rahata he; e = base of napalm saadhaaran padaarthon main 1000° k ke taap ke aasapaas vishesh maatra main electranon kaa utsarjan hota he
 This is an important point that needs to be taken into account in the choice of materials that are used as emitters, because the perishable materials cannot be used at this temperature
 duusari baat jo dhyaan main rakhi jaati he vah utsarjak kaa jivan he
 Only those substances that have a life of about 1,000 hours can be used as emitters
 in vichaaron ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yadi un padaarthon kii khoj kii jaae jo utsarjak ke rup main prayog main laae ja sakate hai to bahut hi kam sankhya main padaarth milenge
 The emitters used in electronic tubes commercially are either oxide coated emitters or tungsten containing tungsten or thorium
 ab ham un baton par vichaar karenge jinpar tapayanic utsarjan nirbhar rahata he
 The change of the thermodynamic current with the band voltage at a certain temperature can be shown in Figure 1
 is chitra se yah dekha ja saktaa he ki tapayanic dhara om ke siddhant ke anusaar nahin badalati
 At first, it increases slowly as the band voltage increases, then some more rapidly and finally stabilizes
 isaki santrupt dhara kehete hai
 Such curve lines can be found at different temperatures
 taap ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan karne ke liye pattic voltata ko itnaa badha diya jaataa he ki santrupt dhara bahane lage
 The heat of the emitter is then converted and the saturated current is brought to different temperatures
 jab santrupt dhara ke is maan ko tapon ke vibhinn maanon ke saath rekhachitr ke dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he to chitra 2 main di hui vakr rekha praapt hoti he
 At low temperatures, thermogenic emissions are usually negligible
 tapayanic utsarjan lagbhag 1000° kelvin ke aasapaas aarambh hota he or phir taap badhane ke saath shighrata se badhata he
 The amount of emission also increases with the increase of the area of the emitter
 yadi kshetrafal adhik ho to tapayanic dhara bhi adhik hoti he
 Thermal emissions in pure materials occur only at high temperatures
 aisa dekha gaya he ki ashuddhiyon kii upasthiti utsarjan par prabhaav daalati he
 Alkaline metals are more active as emitters
 san 1908 main wenlt ne ek mahatvapurn khoj kii
 He observed that when the emitter used in the electron tube is coated with alkaline oxides, the thermogenic emissions are greatly increased
 nimna tapon or nimna voltata par is prakaar ke utsarjak bahut hi upyogi hote hai
 Nowadays, most electron tubes are used as oxide coated emitters in negative ray tubes and gas tubes
 yadi gas kii thodi si maatra nirvaat nalee main pahunchaa di jaae to tapayanic utsarjan kaaphi bad jaataa he
 For example, even a minimum amount of hydrogen can reach a vacuum tube, increasing the thermogenic current by 105 times
 iske do kaaran hai
 One is ionization that electrons gain so much kinetic energy that they convert the gas atoms into ions by encounters
 is prakaar electranon kii sankhya main atyadhik vruddhi ho jaati he
 The adsorbed molecule or atom forms a diploid surface of the electrode on the metal surface, which either aids in emission or reduces it
 sahaayak hona athwa na hona un parmaanuon ke swabhaav par nirbhar rahata he
 Hiii tapayanic dhara tabhi bah sakati he jab utsarjak or usko chaaron ore ghere hue belan kii bich dhan vibhav jari rakhaa jaataa he
 Electrons are negatively charged particles
 is kaaran ve belan kii ore khinch jate hai jo dhan vibhav par rahata he
 For this reason it may appear that a very thermogenic current can flow at very low potential
 parantu yah dekha gaya he ki adhik dhara pravaahit karne ke liye adhik dhan vibhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The reason for this is that the traveling electrons generate a transfer charge near the emitter
 yah antaran aavesh utsarjit electranon ko peeche phenk detaa he
 The effect of this transfer charge can be removed by the appropriate high potential
 yadi dhan vibhav ko paryaapt adhik badha diya jaae to nimna taap par bhi utsarjan ho saktaa he
 This type of emission is called cold emission
 is thande utsarjan ke liye 10,000 volt prati centimetre ke abhikshetra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As already mentioned, tungsten, thorium-containing tungsten and oxide coated emitters are often used in this work
 in utsarjakon ke nimnaankit gun hai : Tungsten can be used only at very high temperatures
 is kaaran yah shuddh avasthaa main yadakada hi prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 It is used as an emitter only when no other emitter can be used at high temperature
 iskaa prayog adhiktar un naliyon main hota he jinamein pattic voltata 3,500 volt se adhik hoti he
 This type of emitter emits far more emissions than pure tungsten, at the same temperature
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki thorium kii upasthiti ke kaaran sataha kaa vyatikraman karne ke liye electron ko jo kaary karnaa padataa he vah paryaapt kam ho jaataa he
 Chemical poisoning occurs due to some gas remaining in the tube
 yadi dhan aayan ke takkar or rasinic vishaaktata ke prabhaavon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaae to dekha jaataa he ki thorium yukt tungsten ke utsarjak oxide lepit utsarjak kii apeksha adhik tikaoo hote hai
 Such emitters are made by mixing a mixture of oxides of barium and strontium on a suitable metal surface
 saadharantaya nikal dhaatu hi is kaary main lagaai jaati he
 Sometimes a nickel alloy is also used
 yadi is prakaar kii sataha uchit rup se banaai or sakriy kii jaae to 1150° k par paryaapt maatra main electron utsarjan hota he
 The emission appears to be from the free radicals of the metal that remain on the surface of the oxide coating
 oxide lepit utsarjak nirvaat naliyon main adhik prayukt hote hai
 The reason for this is that the oxide coated emitter gives more emissions for each watt of heat power than other types of emitters and gives more amperes per square centimeter than other emitters
 oxiu lepit utsarjakon kaa ek vishesh laabhadaayak gun yah bhi he ki isse atyadhik electranon kaa utsarjan ek hi samay main ho saktaa he, chaahe yah samay kuch micro second hi kyon na ho 
 There are usually two types of emitters used
 pehle prakaar ke utsarjak tantu ke rup main bane rahete hai, jinamein vidyuddhara pravaahit karke adhik taap tak garam kiye jate hai
 The second type of emitters are those which are indirectly heated
 ye dhaatu kii patali chadar ke belan ke rup main hote hai
 This cylinder is heated with external detached tungsten metal fibers, called heaters
 bahut pehle se yah gyaat he ki yadi kisi dhaatu ko electron kii dhara se pratadit kiya jaae to ek gaun prakaash utpann hota he
 This is called secondary emission
 iskaa tapayanic naliyon main bahut hi mahatv he kyonki yah anichhinn prabhaav ke rup main nalee main prakat ho jaataa he
 The number of secondary electrons when subjected to primary electrons depends on the speed of the primary electrons and on the nature and condition of the object that is being repulsed
 yadi purvavarti electranon kii gati atyadhik nune ho to gaun utsarjan nahin hota
 In secondary electrons, there are usually 90 percent whose velocity is much less than the primary electrons
 tathaapi kuch gaun electron aise bhi utsarjit hote hai jinka veg praathmik electranon se adhik hota he or kai pratishat aise hote hai jinka veg praathmik electranon ke veg ke baraabar hota he
 Secondary emissions from separators - Secondary emissions from separators are sometimes more beneficial than emission of metals
 iskaa ek ullekhneey or sarvavidit udhaaharan nalee ke kaach kii deevaaron kaa electron ke pratadan dwaara vidyudyukt hona he
 The second example is the existence of the resonance plates of the tubes
 vartmaan kaal main prayog main laai janevaali vibhinn prakaar kii sangrah naliyon main pruthakkari se gaun utsarjan kaa upyog kiya jaataa he

 As a result, the temperature of the ice is considered the lowest point of thermometry
 parantu fahrenheit ne sarvapratham pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa maan - 18 degree tak ho saktaa he
 It is clear from the study of gas principles that, at least theoretically, the melting point of ice is 273 degrees Celsius
 Less heat can be achieved
 is - 273 degree sein
 taap ko "absolute zero" arthath param shunya kehete hai
 From both theoretical and experimental considerations, the origin of minimum temperature has special significance

 About 70 years after this, Furcrave and Volcano - 40 ° C
 He succeeded in liquefying ammonia gas by obtaining heat

 Faraday, Caledon, and Theliorier worked on the principles of liquefying gases due to pressure
 thilorier ne thos carbon daai-oxide evam ether ke "freezing mixchar" kaa upyog bhi kiya or - 110 degree sein
 taap praapt kiya
 In those days it was believed that only a few gases could be liquefied and gases like hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen could not liquefy
 in gaison ko "chirsthayee gas" kii oopaadhi tak de di gai, yadhyapi kaayate or pickte 1877 i
 main hydrogen, nitrogen tathaa aksigen gaison ke dravan main safal hue
 The following are the various major methods of liquefaction of gases: is vidhi main gas ko paryaapt thanda kiya jaataa he or tab ek saath thand evam ucch daab kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 But frost is achieved by the use of different liquids whose boiling point decreases gradually
 isi kaaran is vidhi ko "cascad vidhi" yaa "series refrijreshan" kehete hai
 Skirte first moved oxygen through this method
 vroblevski or olszevski ne is vidhi dwaara kaaphi maatra main drav oxygen, drav nitrogen evam drav carbon diaksaide praapt kiya or inke gunon kaa adhyayan kiya
 Olszewski used liquid-ethylene in the final stage, allowing him to cool the above gases to below their "critical temperature"
 cameraling ones ne mithail-chloride or ethilin kaa upyog is vidhi main karke oxygen kaa lagaataar dravan kiya
 It was also used at the industrial level
 isi vidhi se hawa ko bhi dravit kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, we have to use a fourth part of the device, in which liquid oxygen will help to cool the air to its critical temperature
 parantu niyon, hydrogen or helium gaisen is vidhi dwaara dravit nahin kii ja saktin, kyonki koi bhi dravit gas itnaa kam taap, ghataae hue dabaav main vaashp hone par bhi, utpann nahin kar sakati
 This method is a bit difficult because it is not used much these days
 is vidhi ke siddhant jul-tamson prabhaav evam regenrative kooling par aadhaarit hai
 The use of the "jul – Tamson effect" over the "cascade method" has two distinct advantages: gas kaa utkramanank tak hi thanda kar dena paryaapt he, jab ki "cascad vidhi" ke kranthik taap ke neeche tak thanda karnaa padataa he jo utkramanank se bahut neeche hota he
 2
 Much less preheating is required than the "cascade method"
 phir "jul-tamson prabhaav" dwaara kam thand kii prapti kii maatra "regenrative kooling" se badha di jaati he
 Regeneration theory was first used in this direction by Linde, Hampson and many others
 linde ne sarvapratham is vidhi kaa upyog hawa ke dravan ke liye kiya
 Dewar liquefied hydrogen by this method in 1898 and the Camerling Ones made helium
 linde kaa upkaran main 200 "atmasphereon" par sikudi hui hawa pani dwaara thanda kiye hue pipe se bheji jaati he, jahaan par sikudne se hawa kaa jo taap bad jaataa he vah nikal jaataa he
 Thereafter the shrunken air is sent through an annular tube with a subtle outcrop at the end
 hawa ke sookshm bahidwar se baahar aane main usamen failaav hota he tathaa uskaa taap gir jaataa he
 This cold air now moves upwards and again into the "compression pump"
 yah thandi hawa lagbhag bahari dabaav par hi hoti he or maarg main kundalakaar nalee ke andar kii hawa ko thandi karti jaati he
 Due to repeated shrinkage and spreading, the heat is obtained which is sufficient to liquefy the air
 linde kaa upkaran teen ashwashakti ke yantra se chaalit tha or usase ek litre drav hawa prati ghante praapt hoti thi
 Although liquefaction based on the joule-tamson effect is in special use, they cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory, as they have a capacity of around 15%
 gaison ke ruddhoshm prasaran siddhanton par aadhaarit vidhi nishchit or prabhaavshaalee siddh hui
 In fact, Pickett had already liquefied oxygen with the "cascade method", but Caloret had liquefied oxygen in the monsoon diffusion method in 1877
 ruddhoshm prasaran vidhi satat vidhi nahin thi
 Therefore, this method was not used at the industrial level until Claude and Helant developed a new method for liquefaction of air
 sabase badi kathinaayee is baat kii thi ki koun se snehak kaa upyog mashin ke chalanevaale hisson main kiya jaay, kyonki sabhi saadhaaran snehak sambhddha tapon par thos main parivartit ho jate the
 Claude overcame this difficulty with the use of petroleum ether, which - 160 ° C
 Till sticky
 claude kaa upkaran main sikudi hui gas ek pipe se bheji jaati he jo aage chalakar k sthaan par do shakhaon main vibhakt ho jaati he
 Some amount of gas acts on the diffusion cylinder and pushes it and cools itself
 ab yah thandi gas neeche se upar kii ore jaati he jisase dravan kaksh kii nalee main neeche aati hui gas thandhi hoti jaati he
 When the gas of the tube comes out at the micro exit gate, it expands and cools down
 gas kii jo maatra dravit hone se bachi rah jaati he vah pun: sampeden pump main chali jaati he or is prakaar puri kriya baar baar duharai jaati he
 In 1934, Capiza liquefied helium and hydrogen by the Clod method
 san 1947 i
 main colins ke capiza vidhi dwaara audyogic rup main helium-dravan-mashin taiyaar kii
 This method is particularly important in the direction of achieving zero temperature
 is vidhi ke vikaas ke purv nimnatam prapya taap drav helium evam thos helium ke the, jo kramash: praapt kiye gaye the
 In 1926, Peter Debai made it clear on theoretical grounds that even more low temperatures can be achieved by tempering demagnetization of paramagnetic salts
 kisi vastu ko chumbakeey shakti dene kii kriya main uskaa taap kuch bad jaataa he

 TQM is not for any particular type of enterprise, it is a principle that is necessary to bring quality in every type of enterprise
 TQM graahakon kii "aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne" or unke, uddeshy ke liye upyukt, is saamaanya samaj se bhi aage he
 That is, it makes the organization wider

 TQM is a term derived from the Japanese policy, Total Quality Control 

, This policy was the conclusion of quality assurance
 Since then it has been respected as a new paradigm
 aaj TQM sabhi udyog vyapaar va gatividhiyon main lagu kiya jaataa he
 Whether a hotel or a hospital, an educational institution or an engineering institute, a paan shop or a park, whether it is a lawyer's office or an advisory tool for aircraft maintenance

 TQM takes the basic concept of adopting quality in transformative processes in the beginning and this idea was proposed by the quality guru William Edward Deming
 Deming series feedback to maintain design quality early and excel Advocates systematically applying the total quality principle to achieve
 When every process from raw material to good design and resources is done and the product comes in very good and continuous form of better finished product then it is said It is known that TQM is on

 Yet staff training can inevitably increase the cost of educating suppliers
 The absolute advantage of implementing TQM is quality, brand value, less time promotion, customer confidence, advantages, harmony
 The joy provided by the orchestra or the fife is like that
 Above all it provides sustainable development at a fast pace

 Probiotics are a type of food item, which includes living bacteria or microorganisms

 For this he was also awarded the Nobel Prize later
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar probiotic ve jivit sookshmjeev hote hai jiskaa seven karne par maanav sharir main jaruri tatv sunishchit ho jate hai
 They improve digestion by increasing the number of good bacteria in the body
 is vidhi ke anusaar sharir main do tarah ke jeevanu hote hai, ek mitra or ek shatru
 If food is ingested by friendly bacteria, then gradually they prove effective in destroying the enemy bacteria available in the body
 mitra jeevanu prakritik sroton or bhojan se praapt hote hai, jaise doodh, dahi or kuch paundhon se bhi milte hai
 So far only three-four such bacteria are known which are used in probiotic form
 inamen lactobasilas, bifido, yeast or basilli hai
 These are collected and added to probiotic foods
 vaigyanikon ke ab tak ke adhyayan ke anusaar is tarah se sharir main pahunchane vaale jeevanu kisi prakaar kii haani bhi nahin pahunchaate hai
 Their role in the prevention of diseases in research has been found to be positive and no side effects are known
 maanav pachan tantra ek badi sankhya main sookshmjivon se bharaa hota he, jinase bhojan ko pachaane main madad milti he
 Along with these associate bacteria, there are many such bacteria in the digestive system, which are prone to spread diseases
 probiotic jeevanuon se pachan tantra main flora vyavasthit hone ke saath hanikaarak jeevanuon ke prasar par niyantran bhi sambhav hota he
 For this reason, often after giving antibiotics for a long time, doctors advise the patient to take probiotics

 Milk intake is essential for children as it is a major source of calcium
 isamen probiotic jeevanu sahaayak rahete hai
 Probiotic contains lactic acid bacteria that convert lactose sugar present in milk into lactic acid
 probiotic khadyon se colon cancer se bachaav bhi hota he
 Some research has shown that people using probiotic products are much less likely to develop colon cancer
 isse cholesterol par bhi niyantran hota he
 Blood pressure is also controlled by the use of milk and supplemented food products
 yah maanav sharir ke pratiraksha tantra ke liye bhi laabhadaayak hota he, jisase sharir rogaanuon se bachaav karne main sakasham ho paata he
 Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium food and supplements also help in the prevention of diarrhea

 There have also been many studies on their effects which prove that they can be beneficial in preventing some diseases

 Therefore, according to Indian medical practitioners, probiotic food should not be taken as a medicine, but only in complete food form
 bharat ke swasthya vibhaag salaahkaar ke anusaar videshon main pryobiotic khaadya par bahut shodh hue hai
 According to these researches, probiotics have been effective in preventing diarrhea, diabetes, lower respiratory infections, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, etc
 inke niyamit seven se raktchaap or cholestrol vruddhi bhi rukati he
 Their use in diarrhea infection is effective as a treatment
 abhi tak ye parinaam videshi logon par hue adhyayanon par aadhaarit hai, va bhartiya logon par pareekshan abhi baaki hai
 Indian Council of Medical Research has prepared a guide for India to regulate probiotic foods, which will come into effect from January 2010
 ye maargdarshika rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium ke tahat taiyaar kii gai hai
 The main provision in this is that no probiotic company will claim to cure any disease from them
 yadi company aisa karnaa chaahati he, to use apane utpaadon ko praayogic pareekshan ke liye bhi panjikrut karana hoga or dawaaon kii tarah unke maanviya praayogic pareekshan kiye jaayenge tathaa uske parinaam sahi aane par hi company aisa kar sakegi
 And with this, that food can be kept in the category of probiotic medicine rather than food

 In India, Mother Dairy, Amul, Nirulaz and Yakult and many other companies have launched probiotic milk and yogurt in the market

 Concerns born of the declining membership of civic institutions in American society played a major role behind this debate
 samaaj vaigyanikon ne dekha ki mahamandi or vishwayuddh ke baad paidaa hui peedi ke tirohit ho jane or manoranjan ke electronic sadhano ke sahare ghar kii duniya main kaid ho jane kii pravriti ke kaaran america main saamaajik sansthaaon kii gatividhiyaan thap pad gayi hai
 In response to this, Robert Putnam explored the concept of social capital
 durkhime ke samajashastreey pariprekshya main jo sutrikaran saamaajik ekajutata or uske maikenekil or organic ayaamon ke rup main ubharta he, usee se miltaa-julata pariprekshya putanam ke vimarsh main dikhaai padataa he
 At the heart of the theory of social capital is the insistence that the importance of social networks should not be ignored as social interactions affect the productivity of individuals and their groups
 log vibhinn maksadon se apane samparkon or rishton ko ek mahatvapurn sansaadhan kii tarah istemaal karte hai
 As soon as they get involved in a problem or there is a change in their life, they give voice to friends, relationships and family members
 logon kaa samooh aapas main jud kar apane samaan hiton ko saadhane kaa prayaas karata he
 The same thing can be said in such a way that all forms of social organization are tied to the threads of interpersonal relations
 nabbe ke dashak ke madhya main robert putanam ne is prashn par kai vivaadaatmak lekh likhe
 Then, in 2000, his analytical book, Bowling Alon, full of facts and figures was published, whose distracting image recorded on the pages caught everyone's attention
 is kitaab main putanam dikhaate hai ki america log ek bouling eli main akele hi khel rahe hai jabaki kuch samay pehle tak vahaan vibhinn timen ek sangathit lig ke tahat aapas main khelaa karti thim
 Before the debate in the nineties, the concept of community was not associated with the idea of social capital
 par, putanam or unke saathiyon ne tark diya ki saamaajik poonji kii ahmiyat vyakti tak hi simit nahin he, balki vah ek vyapak saamaajik hit kii guarantee bhi karti he
 The decline in the level of social capital has the opposite effect on the survival of the community itself
 putanam ke prayaason se raajnneetik samajashaastra kii un paramparaon main nayi jaan padi jinke tahat mana jaataa tha ki swayamsevi sansthaayen vyaktiyon ko aapas main sutarabaddh karke ek vyapak sansar kii rachana karti hai
 In the nineteenth century, Alaxis the Talkwheel, in his famous observations of American democracy, showed how various interests and civic organizations maintain solidarity of the entire democratic system through continuous interaction
 dhyaan rahe ki europe ke bare main tokvil kii manyata thi ki vahaan sthirataa laane kii yahi bhoomika rajshahi or kulinatantr ke netritv main jari paramparaon ne nibhaai he
 The relevance of Putnam's ideas can be gauged from the fact that the media took them hand in hand and their influence went beyond the realm of sociology
 anginat radio or tivi kaaryakramon main unhen apni baat kehane kaa mauka mila
 Two American presidents consulted him, and many European Prime Ministers considered his views
 putanam se pehle duusare buddhijivi saamaajik rishton or networkon ke aaine main vibhinn saamaajik-raajnneetik parighatnaon kii jaanch kaa prayaas kar chuke the
 The inequality of social relationships was studied by Jane Jacobs in order to detect the differences between crimes that occur in different cities
 isi vichaar ke aadhaar par francisi samajashastri pier bordiyo bhinn disha main saamaajik- aarthik gair-barabari ke punarutpaadan kii vyakhya kar chuke the
 Bordeaux wrote in a composition published with his partner Loic Vaca that social capital is the sum of real and formless resources that an individual or group gains through membership of a social network
 ye network aapasi jaan-pahchaan ke kamobesh sansthagat rup le chuke sambandhon ke zariye tike rahete hai
 a person is able to hand over the socio-economic status he has acquired on the basis of his social capital to the next generation, thanks to the influence of influential families, his classmates studying in expensive schools and fellow members of a particular club
 
 is saamaajik poonji ko lagaataar praasangik or prabhavi rakhane ke liye vyakti aapasi mail-jol main apane samay kaa yojanabaddh nivesh karata he
 It is clear from this interpretation that Bourdio was contemplating in the neo-marxist realm of class-analysis prevalent in the sixties
 unki dilchaspee yah dikhaane main thi ki abhijanon ke samooh kis tarah apni satta kii nirantarata banaaye rakhte hai
 James Coleman, in contrast, showed through empirical studies among many african-american high school students using the concept of social capital that the qualities found by family and community led to low incomes and poor schooling
 As deficiencies are made up
 bachche ke sangyanatmak vikaas main aise gun mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karte hai
 Coleman was a sociologist with a great interest in economics
 unhone tarksangat saamaajik chayan siddhant kaa aalochana karte hue kaha ki yah siddhant vyaktigat nijee-hit par aadhaarit ravaiye kii to vyakhya kar letaa he, par sahakaari vyavhaar or paropkaaree ravaiye ko nahin samaj paata
 In this sense, the theory of social capital makes up this shortcoming of Rational Choice Theory
 kahana na hoga ki bordiyo kii nigaah main saamaajik poonji kii avadharana oonch-neech kaayam rakhane main madadgaar thi or colman use vanchit samoohon ko aage badhaane main sahaayak ke taur par dekh rahe the
 Although this was an important normative difference, overall both scholars enriched the various dimensions of this theory
 nabbe ke dashak main jab iske ird-gird bahes shuru hui to is siddhant ko naye sire se prashnaankit kiya gaya or apane-apane tarkon ke paksh main dher sari tathyagat daleelein jutayi gayin
 Some studies have shown that social networks are also taken advantage of for anti-social and criminal purposes
 kuch network aise mulyon or aacharan-samhitaon ko majboot karte hai jinke prabhaav ke tahat log samasyaon ke thik se nidaan karne main asamarth ho jate hai
 There was also debate as to how much of this theory is sociocultural and how much economist
 isi ke tahat poocha gaya ki kya poonji shabd kaa istemaal isamen keval roopak ke taur par kiya ja rahaa he yaa saamaajik poonji ko baqayada napa bhi ja saktaa he or usase hone vaale munaafe kii dar kaa bhi pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he

 In physics, black body is an idealized state of matter, which absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it
 krishnika ek vishesh or satat varnakram main vikiran ko avashoshit or garm hone par phir se utsarjit karte hai
 Because no light is reflected or transmitted and when the object is cold, black appears
 haalanki ek krishnika taapmaana par nirbhar prakaash varnakram kaa utsarjan karata he
 This solar radiation emitted from the black body is called the black body radiation
 krishnika ke varnakram main tarang kii lambaai jitani choti hoti he, aavriti utani hi zyada hoti he or ucch aavriti ucch taapmaana se sambandhit hoti he
 Thus, the color of a hot object is closer to the blue end of the spectrum and the color of a colder object is closer to red
 kamare ke taapmaana par, krishnika zyaadaatar avarakt tarangadairghy phenkate hai, lekin taapmaana ke kuch sau degree celsius bad jane par krishnika drishy tarangadairghy utsarjit karte hai, jo taapmaana badhane ke saath hi laal, naarangi, pile, ujle, nile dikhte hai
 It emits sufficient amounts of ultraviolet radiation until the object turns white
 "krishnika" shabd 1860 mengustav kirchaaf ke dwaara shuru kiya gaya
 When its compound is used as an adjective, the word is usually combined into a single term as "black body radiation" or "blackbody radiation"
 krishnika utsarjan ek nirantar jari rahane vaale kshetra ke saura santulansthiti kii antardrushti pradaan karata he
 In classical physics solar equilibrium must have the same energy in each different Fourier mode
 is drushtikon se ek virodhabhas paidaa hua, jise parabangnee aapadaa ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jisamen satat jari rahane vaale kshetra main urja kii ek apaar maatra hoti he
 The black body can test the properties of solar equilibrium, as those that emit radiation delivered by the sun's rays
 aitihaasik rup se krishnika ke niyamon kaa adhyayan karne se hi kwantum yantriki kii avadharana ai
 The radiation of the black body is the solar equilibrium with the black body at a particular temperature and the light radiating from it
 yah prakaash ke thermodynemics santulan kii sthiti ko sandarbhit karata he
 Experimentally it has been established as steady state equilibrium radiation in a rigid-walled cavity containing a black body
 prakruti main dridhtaa se koi vaastavik krishnika nahin hote lekin grafite ek acha saadrishy he or sthir sthiti par grafite deevaaron yukt ek band box krishnika ke adarsh vikiran kaa ek acha sanniktan he
 a cavity, which has no black body, is not capable of retaining black-body radiation in equilibrium conditions, a fact found experimentally by Kirchhoff, but neither its physical significance was understood by Kirchhoff nor by Planck
 chunki prakaash nirantaravidyut chumbakeey kshetra kaa ek dolyman rup he, krishnika ke vikiran-adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki satat kshetron main kaisaa taapmaana hota he, jo shastreey bhautikee se virodhabhas prakat karata he
 Because the solar state of light was so confusing before the advent of quantum mechanics, these 19th-century arguments were presented with great caution that light has a solar equilibrium state
 nirdhaarit taapmaana main tii main koi padaarth ek oven kii tarah chamakta hua dekha ja saktaa he
 The point at which all solids produce a dull red glow is named the Draper point
 1000 ke par ek oven laal dikhataa he or 6000 ke par yah safed dikhaai detaa he
 As long as the oven is not shiny enough it does not matter how the furnace is built, the color of the light depends only on the temperature
 chunki rang tarangadairghy kaa pratyaksh rup se darshneey upaay he, isliye yah kehane kaa matlab he ki alag-alag taapmaana par prakaash se alag-alag tarangadairghy ke bich bhinn-bhinn urja vitarit hoti he
 The amount of energy per unit volume e at λ wavelength at t temperature is called the state of black body rotation
 vistrut prayogon se pataa chalaa he ki krishnika ke ghumaav kii avasthaa keval taapmaana par nirbhar karti he, na ki utsarjit padaarth par
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki kisi bhi anya vastu kii tarah prakaash vastav main saura santulan se aata he or is prakaar tii taapmaana main prakaash kii avadharana samaj main aati he
 Two things can remain in equilibrium at the same temperature, such that a substance surrounded by a cloud of light at t temperature can radiate as much light into the cloud on average at t temperature as it absorbs, based on the exchange principle of the prevost, Which refers to the radiative equilibrium
 vistrut santulan kaa siddhant kahata he ki utsarjan or avasorana kii prakriya ke bich koi ajeeb kism kaa sah-sambandh nahin he, utsarjan kii prakriya avasorana se prabhavit nahin hoti balki yah keval utsarjan kar rahe padaarth kii saura sthiti se prabhavit hoti he
 This means that the total light emitted by matter at t temperature, whether it is a Krishna substance or not, is always equal to the total light that the substance absorbs, surrounded by light at t temperature
 krishnika ke liye avashoshit prakaash kii maatra utani hoti he, jitani vah sataha par padati he
 The light energy absorbed per unit time of any wavelength λ is essentially proportional to the curve of the black body
 iskaa matlab he ki krishnika kaa ghumaav krishnika dwaara utsarjit prakaash urja jitna he, jo iske naam ko upyukt tehraata he
 This is the Kirchhoff rule of solar radiation: the emission of a black body is a solar characteristic of light, which depends only on the temperature of the cavity walls, provided it is necessary to have the condition that the cavity contains some completely black material and that it is in radiative equilibrium
 Ho
 jab krishnika itnaa chota ho ki iske aakaar kii prakaash ke tarangadairghy se tulana kii ja sake to avasorana sanshodhit ho jaataa he, kyonki ek choti si vastu lambey tarangadairghy ke prakaash kaa ek kushal avasorak nahin ho sakati, lekin utsarjan or avasorana kii kathor samanta ke siddhant hameshaa sahi tehraye jate hai
 In the laboratory, the amount of radiation of a black body is estimated at the entrance of a large cavity through a small hole, a ahoeleram, which contains a black body, which is transported to equilibrium and retained
 
 is chhed main pravesh karne vaali prakaash kii kisi kiran ko nikalne se pehle guha kii deevaaron par kai baar pratibimbit hona hota he, jis prakriya main iskaa avashoshit hona lagbhag nishchit ho jaataa he
 This can also happen without regard to the wavelength of the radiation entering
 The hole will then form a close approximation to a theoretical black body and if the cavity is heated, the spectrum of radiation of the hole will be constant, although it will also be necessary to ensure that some of the almost completely black material is placed in the cavity and Also that the balance has been maintained and maintained, but with these provisions, it no longer depends on other materials of the cavity
 
 Calculating the rotation of the black body was a major challenge in theoretical physics during the latter part of the 19th century
 aakhir is samasya kaa hal 1901 main maiks plank dwaara krishnika vikiran ke plank niyam dwaara kiya gaya
 Keeping pace with thermodynamics and electromagnetism, he made changes to the radiation law of Wynne and found a mathematical formula suitable for experimental data in a satisfactory way
 apane formule kii bhautik vyakhya paane ke liye tab plank ne yah mana ki guha main dolan kii urja santulit ho gai he
 Einstein took this idea further and proposed quantization of electromagnetic radiation only in 1905 to explain the photo electric effect
 in saidhantik pragatiyon ke parinamswaroop antat kwantum electrodynemics ne clasical electromegatismo ko khatm kar diya
 Today, these quanta are called photons, and it can be thought that the cavity of a black body may contain photons

 yah {0}utsarjan{ / 0} kai karkon, jaise taapmaana, utsarjan kii disha or tarangadairghy par nirbhar karata he
 However, in engineering this value is specific that the spectral emission and absorption of a surface do not depend on the wavelength, so emission is a continuous process
 ise grey body purvanumaan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The divergence of the ideal dark-matter behavior in order to deal with non-black surfaces is determined by both geometrical structure and chemical compositions and must also be determined to be approximately the radiative equilibrium current of the black body
 yah kicharf niyam ke kareeb hai : utsarjan avasorana ke baraabar hota he, isliye jo vastu pad rahe samast prakaash ko avashoshit nahin karti vah ek adarsh krishnika kii tulana main kam vikiran utsarjit karegi
 In astronomy, objects such as stars are often considered to be black bodies, although this is a weak approximation

 The spread of radiation is an imaginary black-body radiation emitted by black holes
 haalanki plank ke formule main bhavishyavaanee kii gai he ki ek krishnika sabhi aavritiyon par urja kaa vikiran karegaa, haalanki yah formula tabhi lagu hoga, jab anek photons ko mapa ja rahaa ho
 For example, a black body in a surface area of one square meter at room temperature will emit a photon over the visual range at an average rate of one photon every 41 seconds, which means that in most practical purposes a black body emits in the visible range Will not do haalanki ek krishnika ek saidhantik vastu he, avarakt vikiran ko strot ke saamaanya anuprayog ek krishnika ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai, jab vastu 1

 When an infrared radiation source is less than 0
99, it is referred to as a "gray body"
 krishnika anukaari ke anuprayogon main aam taur par avarakt pranaaliyon or avarakt samvedak upkaran kaa pareekshan or anshankan shaamil hota hai
 One such example is the super-black body, which is made from a nickel-phosphorus alloy

 Planck's law states that jahaan The displacement law of wyne shows how the black body radiation is related to the spectrum at any other temperature
 agar hamen ek taapmaana par varnakram ke aakaar kaa pataa he to ham kisi anya taapmaana par aakaar kii gananaa kar sakate hai
 One consequence of Wayne's displacement law is that a wavelength at which the radiation intensity produced by the black body is maximum, λ max { \ displaystyle \ lambda _ { \ mathrm {max}}}, is simply a function of temperature
 jahaan nirantar bi, jo vaayen kii visthaapan nirantarata ke rup main janaa he, baraabar hota he2

 Net radiation energy is the difference between the energy emitted and the energy absorbed: stephen-boltzman niyam ko lagu karnaa, The total surface area of an adult is 2 m2 and the middle and far-infrared emissivity of the skin and most of the clothing is close to unification, as it is the most non-metallic surface
 twachaa kaa taapmaana 33 degree celsius hota he, lekin kapade sataha ke taapmaana ko 28 degree celsius kam kar dete hai, jab kii parivesh kaa taapmaana 20 degree celsius hota he
 Therefore, the loss of pure radiative heat is almost as follows ek din main vikirn kul urja 9 MJ, yaa 2000 kilo calories hoti he
 a 40-year-old male has a basal metabolic rate of about 35 kcal / day, which is equivalent to 1700 kcal per day and can be considered 2 m2
 haalanki, nk sust vayask kii madhyam chayapachay dar 50 se 70% hoti he, jo unke basal dar se adhik hoti he
 Other important thermal loss mechanisms, including convection and evaporation, also occur
 sanvahan naganya hota he kyonki nuselt sankhya eky se kaaphi zyada hoti he
 Evaporation is needed only when radiation and convection are insufficient to maintain a constant state of temperature
 ni:shulk sanvahan dar tulanaatmak hai, kam yadhyapi kuch had tak vikaranshil dar kii tulana main kam hote hai
 Thus, radiation equals two-thirds of thermal energy loss in cold and still air
 kai manyataon kii anumaanit prakruti ko dekhte hue ise keval ek mote anumaan ke rup main liya ja saktaa he
 Ambient air motion, produces forced convection, or evaporation reduces the comparative importance of radiation as a thermal loss mechanism

 The Stefan – Boltzmann law gives the total energy emitted by the Sun
 jahaan The Sun emits energy equally in all directions
 is vajah se, prithvi uske keval ek chote se ansh se hi garm ho jaati he
 The energy of the sun falls on the earth is: to Due to high temperatures, the sun emits massive amounts of ultraviolet and visible frequency ranges

 agar ham surya or prithvi ke liye maapit mulyon kaa sthanapann nikaalen: If we determine the average emission of Unity, we can calculate that the Earth's "effective temperature" would be: prithvi kaa yahi taapmaana hoga agar yah greenhouse prabhaav kii andekhi karte hue or ek aparivartaneey albido kii sthiti main yah avarakt sthiti main ek purna krishnika ke rup main vikirn hoti he
 In fact, the Earth is radiated into the infrared as a full black body, which will raise the predicted temperature by just a few degrees above the effective temperature
 If we want to estimate what the temperature of the Earth will be if there is no atmosphere, then we have to take into account the emission of albedo and the moon as a good way of estimation

 The Doppler effect is a well-known fact that describes how frequencies of light are "shifted" when a light source is moving relative to the observer
 agar epa ek ekvarni prakaash ke strot kii utsarjit aavriti he, to yah epa aavriti par tab dikhegaa jab vah paryvekshak ke saapeksh gum rahaa ho
 Where v is the source of velocity in the observer's rest frame, then θ is the angle between the velocity vector and the observer source direction and c is the speed of light

 To calculate the spectrum of a moving black body, it seems clear that this formula applies for each frequency of the black body spectrum
 haalanki, saadhaaran rup se iske jaisi prayek aavriti kii scalling paryaapt nahin he
 We have to keep an account of the finite size of the visible cavity, because the solid angle receiving the light is also affected by Lorentz's change
