 In 1890, Coubertin wrote an article in the monthly magazine La Review Athletic, in which he described the importance of Much Wenloch, a rural market-town in the English county of Shropshire
 yahi wo jagah thi jahaan sthaneey chikitsak wiliam pani bruke ne venlok olympic khelon kii sthapana kii thi, ek khel utsav va manoranjan kaa saadhan jisamen athletics or cricket, footbaal or coits jaise team khel shaamil kiye jate the

 Concerned that public interest in sports might be reduced in the six-year waiting period, members of the conference opted instead to hold the consecratory games in 1896

 iske anek kaaran ho sakate hai
 Being a Buddhist, perhaps Chandragomin considered the scripture of Brahmadharmanayyayas as their religious-ceremonial speech and deemed the grammatical construction of the language unnecessary
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki hajaaron varsh puraani vaidic sanskrit ke bhashaprayegon kii vyakaranvivechna ko adhik prayojan kaa na samajha ho- vishesh rup se sanskrit bhashagnanarthi baudhon ke liye
 One reason is that due to the urge to create a simplified grammatical method, they have not been desired to write the grammar of residual language in old and obsolete in practice
 is vyakarangranth kii rachana aisa sarvapratham mahaprayas he jise ham panineey ashtaadhi kaa pratisanshodhit punassanskaran kah sakate hai
 The second such epic attempt is a grammar book called 'saraswati Kantabharan' of Bhojraj
 isamen katyayan or patanjali ke vaarthik or mahabhashyiya sampurna sujhaavon or sanshodhano ko praaia: apana liya gaya he
 In this grammar, the nouns that have been derived from the noun, especially monosyllabic nouns like 'ti', 'ghu', are excluded
 isi kaaran is sampradaay ko 'asanjnak' vyakaran bhi kehete hai
 Nevertheless, its basic structure is certainly built on the foundation of Ashtadhyayi
 is vyakaran ke adhikansh sutara ashtaadhi ke hi hai yaa ashtaadhi sutron ke hi roopaantar hai
 In the transformed formulas there are some in which even the words are only of Panini, only their order has changed, such as in place of Panini's 'anekashitva Sarvasya' and 'adyantou Takitou' Sutras are 'shidanekal' Sarvastha and 'takitavarganthau' respectively
 kalkram se prachlit navaprayogon ke liye kuch nutan sutara bhi nirmit hai
 The corresponding number is about 3100
 kaha jaataa he, vyakaranparishisht rup main chandragomin ne unadipth, dhatupath, ganpaath, lingakarika, varnasutra or upsargavritti kii bhi rachana kii thi jinamein unadisuchi or dhatupath kaa prakaashan 'chandravyakaran' granth ke saath hi hua he
 The 'varnasutra' describes the efforts of the place of the Varnas in the same formulas of Panini education
 'chandravyakaransutravriti' ke atirikt dharmik granth 'shishylekh' or 'lokanand' naatak ke nirmaan kaa, jinka adhik mahatv nahin he, gaurav bhi chandracharya ko praapt he
 The most surprising thing in this context is that this book, which was prevalent in the study of studies in Bengal till a few centuries ago and cited by subsequent legalizations, was found in Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet, not in Bengal itself

 mata kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue guru sahib ne ye chola unase lekar pahan liya
 When Guru Sahib was freed from the fort of Gwalior, he wore this same chola, whose 52 kings, holding 52 buds, came out one by one in the prison of the fort, since then Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji called "donor Bandi Chod"

 From a religious point of view, the turkish-mongol Ilkhan Empire later adopted Shia religion and this is also consistent with the Hazara people being Shia

 According to the traditional belief of Indians, Sanskrit language and Brahmi script were introduced in the early era by the creator "brahma"

 "amarkosh" by "brahmi Tu Indian language Girvagwani Saraswati" indicates a broad vision of the meaning of the term "brahmi"
 yah shabd "saraswati" kaa bhi or "bhashaa" kaa bhi abhidhaan he
 But modern historians of East and West do not believe in these mythological and traditional theories

 brahmi kii utpatti ko vidwaanon kaa ek varg abhartiya maanata he
 Second class Indians
 duusare varg ke log iskaa vikaas swatantra rup main bhartiya seemaa ke bheetar hi maanate hai
 Here, based on the articles of currency available from Harappa and Mohenjodaro, the script of Sindhughati civilization explains the origin of "brahmi"
 kuch saahasik vidwaanon ne sumeri, sindhughati or vaidic arya- teenon sabhyataaon ko ek mul strot se viksit maanakar kisi ek lipi se athwa pracheenatam sumeri lipi se brahmi ke udbhav kaa anumaan kiya he
 But this opinion is still serious for consideration
 sindhughati kii lipi brahmi or kharoshtee donon se vicitra or bhinn lagati he
 In conclusion, it can be said that according to the opinion of most Indian pundits, "devanagari" has developed from that "brahmi" which was in BC
 Was practiced in India for thousands of years and was developed in India and by Indians themselves
 bhartiya bhashaaon main sanganak par kaary karne ke liye unki lipiyon kii buniyadisamajh aavashyak he
 There are two types of alphabets in the alphabet
 vyanjan ve varna hai jinhen ek akeli ikai ke rup main bina swar kisahayta se uccharit nahin kiya ja saktaa, jabaki swaron kaa uccharan swatantraroop se yaa vyanjan ke saath jodakar kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, if we pronounce 'k'avarna alone, it will definitely have the vowel sound' a 'with the consonant sound' k '
 jabaki swar dhwani `a' kaa uccharan swatantra rup se kiya jaasakata he
 While speaking, we pronounce the sounds coming in a sentence or word in series
 in uccharit dhvaniyon ko yadi ham vyanjanav swar varnon kii sahaayta se krambaddh tareeke se likhen to hindi shabd `kamala'kuch isprakaar se likhaa jayega : Here, each consonant and vowel is spelled differently
 is likhaneke tareeke main visheshta yah he ki isamen varnakshar vyanjan or swar uccharankram ke anusaar likhe gayi hai
 When the words pronounced in the word are written in alphabetical order by the characters, this method is called descriptive marking
 varnatmak chihnavali samajhane main saral hoti he tathaa bhashaa ko lipibaddh karne kidisha main ise pehla swaabhaavik kadam mana ja saktaa he
 It is also suitable for typing
 kintu isaki kami yah he ki isamen likhnaa zyada padataahai jiske kaaran samay or kagaz donon hi kaa zyada kharch hota he
 The English kiroman script is a descriptive marking
 angrezi main 'kamala' dhwanikram isprakaar likhaa jayega : kamala varnatmak chihnavali kii uparokt kamiyon ko dur karne ke liye bhartiyabhashaon main aksharatmak chihnavali kaa vikaas kiyagaya he
 Under it, for each syllable syllable, there is a symbol cowpe, called a letter
 swarant syllable se arth he shunya, ek yaa usase adhik vyanjanon ke baad swar se milakar banane vaala varna-kram
 For example, the following alphabetical order is syllable: - shabd ke ant main, antim vyanjanon ke kram main swar na hone par bhiuse akshar ke rup main likh sakate hai; udaahranarth hindi main praayah shabdke antim vyanjan ke swar kaa uccharan nahin hota parantu likhit rup main vahaanpurnakshar kaa prayog hota he
 Such as: Lotus
 atah, akshar ek yaa adhik varnon ko pradarshit karata he
 One important thing in the structure of a letter is that the shape of the letter consists of the size of the quantities of consonants
 atah inhen siikhnaa aasaan he
 
 varnatmak va aksharatmakachihnavali ke kuch saral udhaaharan hai:- The main thing in this is that a "simple" letter was made by adding the vowel 'a' with the consonant
 udaahranarth : yahan `k' pratik he ek saral akshar kaajo 'k' vyanjan va acarant swar ke milane se bana he 
 Under this sign, the quantities were developed for the use of vowels in the consonants
 yadi vyanjan ke baad `a' ke atirikt koi anya swar aata he tiikshar par ek chota sa vishesh chihn laga diya jaataa he jo us swar kaa dyotkahai
 This sign is called the volume of that vowel, such as the quantity of 'U', 'U', the quantity of 'A', 'E', the quantity of 'E', etc
 jab vyanjan ke baad `a'swar aata he to kisi bhi atirikt nishaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 For example, uparokt main `kii' va `kai' ke antar par gaur kiijie
 'ki' has the amount of vowel 'e' on 'a' while 'many' has 'a' and 'e' in alphabetical form
 atah, matraaon ko akshar par ankit kiya jaataa he chaheykshar saral ho yaa sanyukt
 There are specific places to place each quantity, which are around the letter
 jaise:- To the left of the letter comes the quantity of 'I', similarly 'A' and 'A' quantities come up, 'U' and 'U' are below and on the other right
 yah tarika,hast-lekhan ke liye ati laabhprad he
 But there are some difficulties in terms of typing, which we will mention later
 itnaa karne se likhnaa bahut saral vasankshipt ho jaataa he
 Yes, it is a bit hard to learn, because now quantities also have to be learned
 is avishkaar kaa ek parinaam yah he ki ek saral akshar main 'a' kii anupasthitipradarshit karne ke liye ek vishesh maatra lagaani padati he, jise ham halantakahate he
 For example, the word 'a' in the word 'what' has to be stirred: duusari mukhya baat yah he ki jab kisi shabd main vyanjan ek ke baad ek aate hantab unhen ek saath jodakar likhaa jaataa he jise sanyuktakshar bhi kehete he
 The volume is applied to this conjunct, corresponding to the vowel that comes next
 udaahranarth,`kya' shabd main shuddh vyanjan `k' tathaa akshar `ya' he jinhen kram se jodakar`ky' sanyuktakshar banaaya jaataa he
 After that according to the general rule, the quantity of 'A' is imposed on it
 aitihaasik drushti se is tarah kii yogic syllabic-chihnavali,ek kranti se kam nahin he
 This is our familiar modern script
 aksharatmak chihnavali main maatra lagane kaa niyam saral va sanyukt donon hiprakaar ke aksharon par ek samaan lagu hota he
 This means that whether the letter is simple or combined, the quantity will be applied according to the rules given above
 yani `i' kii maatra niyamanusaar byinor lagati he to vah dono prakaar ke aksharon main baayin ore hi lagegi, jaise:-k+i=k+i=ki
 And the same rule also applies to conjuncts, due to which the quantity of 'E' will be written on the left side of the ligature
 neeche diye sanskrit shabd`tasmin' main sanyuktakshar `smi' par dhyaan dijiye:- The 'I' quantity moves to the left of the ligature 'sm', not to the left of 'M', which is according to the rules
 matraayen lagane ke niyam ke antargat prayek akshar ko ek chihnatmakaikai ke rup main liya jaataa he
 The letter itself is incomplete without vowels
 saral akshar maatr ek swar kaa, athwa ek vyanjan + ek swar kaa yoga hota he or sanyuktakshar ek se adhik vyanjan va ek swar kaa yoga hota he
 Similar to the rules for applying quantities, adding recipes to form conjuncts is also simple but special rules are: - The dishes are added from left to right, or top to bottom
 jisamen kram main pehla vyanjan baayin orya upar kii ore hota he
 We have already seen examples from left to right like, 'ky', 'sm' etc
, the examples of adding up and down are given below: - uparokt main chunki 'd' ke pashchaat 'dh' aata he, atah 'da' upar va 'dha'neeche likhaa jaataa he
 When making the conjunct, the second consonant symbol should be written to the right, ie, it depends on how the form of those consonants
 rupake anusaar hi unhen uchit tareeke se jodne main aasaani hoti he
 If there is no standing in the signs of both the vaults, then the second is written below the first, like 'tath'
 `r' ke saath kuch vishesh niyam he jo sankshiptata kii drushti se banaaye gayehain
 These rules depend on the location of 'su' in the sequence of conjuncts
 agar `r' duusare sthaan par he or uske pehle koi vyanjan tathaa baad main swar haito sanyuktakshar banaate samay `r' ke liye pehle vyanjan ke neeche ek vishesh chihnalga diya jaataa he:- Similarly, if there is a consonant after 'su', then a special mark is placed on that consonant: atah sanyuktakshar main `r' vyanjankram main pehle hone par upar tathaa baad memhone par neeche aata he
 Another way in our script to write concisely: - This is the use of Anusvaraka
 prayek vyanjan ke varg main antim vyanjan ke liye, anuswaar kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, jaise:- Anusvara is used for nasal nasality of consonants and nasal is used for nasal nasality of vowels
 udhaaharan ke liye: Of these, the Chandrabindu marks the nasality of the vowels, but the sole purpose of the point is to bring brevity to the script
 yahan yah kahana aavashyak he ki bhashaa kii drushti se shuddh vyanjan va shuddh swarke madhyam se hi vishleshan karnaa sahi he
 According to the ISCII standard, articles are kept in the computer only in an alphabetical mark
 usamenmatraayen bhi shaamil hai
 But for language processing, they can be removed and converted to pure speech and voice easily
 anuswaar kii tarah ke niyam anya bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi hai
 There is a similarity in all Indian languages due to the same alphabetical and alphabetic script
 kisi ek bhashaa kii lipi kaa computarikaran hone par anya bhartiya bhashaonka computarikaran aasaan he
 The technology applied on one can also be used in computerization of other languages
 jaise jist praudyogikikamputer par sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon kii lipiyon main ek saath kaary karti he
 The keyboard is used for typing in computers, whose design depends on the size of our fingers and the length of hands
 atah kunjiyon kii banaavat va aakaar main atyadhik parivartan nahiho saktaa
 When there are more keys, it becomes difficult to find and remember the keys
 atah ek sanyuktakshar kaa ek hi kunjee se tankan karnaa mushkilav alaabhprad he
 There were many difficulties in typing on a machine typewriter made before the arrival of computers
 pehali to yah ki yadi ham chaahate hai kitip kii hui saamagree aksharatmak-chihnavali main dikhe, to usee chihnavalimen use tip karnaa anivaary he
 Therefore, many symbols including conjuncts had to be memorized on the keyboard
 doosraa, chunki matraayen akshar ke chaaron ora sakati hai, atah aisi mashin bananaa to jatil kaary tha hi, saath hi output sundaranheen dikhataa tha
 In view of all this, it was thought in computer technology that if we could do typing in descriptive markings, but it would be good to see the familiar alphabetical markings on the computer screen
 isi ko aadhaar maanakris praudyogiki kaa safal vikaas kiya gaya he
 All these shortcomings have been overcome by the advent of computers
 parantu yah aavashyak he ki ham varnatmak va aksharatmakachihnavali main parsparik sambandh ko samajhen
 This question may also arise in the mind that if the descriptive script Koman was taken for typing, all these problems would have gone away
 parantu chunki hast-lekhan main aksharatmak lipi prachlit thi, atah varnatmak lipi kaa upyogkarne kaa sochaa nahin gaya
 This is an example where, being a better science, technology was not used because it had not yet reached that level
 shaayad isi karanvash chhapakhane kaa bhi prachlan utananhin hua jitna hona chahie tha
 The loss we suffered from not using this technology is well known
 shaayad yah bhi ek kaaran tha ki europe ham se vigyaan main aage nikal gaya
 Now these things can only be estimated, it is difficult to say for sure
 prashn uth saktaa he ki yadi akshar shuddh vyanjan va swar kaa yoga he to matrakya he? m + i = mi kyon hota he `mi_' kyon nahin ? inkaa uttar ekaganitiya sameekaran ke rup main neeche diya ja rahaa he
 Here we will refer to the relation of quantity and vowel signs as a mathematical equation
 maatra sahit va maatra rahit chihnawaliyon ke kai udhaaharan ham dekh chuke hai
 like:- hamen yah bhi pataa he ki 'k' ko shuddh vyanjan va swar main toda ja saktaa he:- The value of 'A' above can be placed in the equation to the right: - isi prakaar se, sameekaran ke donon ore se 'k' ko gata sakate hai,thik vaise hi, jaise ganit ke udhaaharan main 8 ko gata diya gaya he
 And by removing 'K' from both sides, we get: - uparokt ek mahatvapurn sameekaran he, jo 'i' swar kaa mulya apanimatra ke rup main detaa he
 In the above, the value of the vowel 'I' is written in quantities
 ab ham matraake mulya ko swar main pradarshit karengen
 Let's first look at the mathematics equation
 sameekaran ke baane hisse menyadi ham shunya jod den to hamen miltaa he:- Now if you place 0: - 1 + then: - isi prakaar se ab dekhte hai ki maatra kaa apane swar se kya sambandhhai
 To detect this we would need a zero of the script
 hamajaante hai ki halant 'a' ko ghataata he, arthath:- Now by adding zero after 'Q' to the left side of the equation, we get: - donon ore se 'k' ghataane par, Or, you can write it like this: yah sameekaran pradarshit karata he ki maatra `i' kaa mulya he halant jamaa 'i'
 That is, 'E' contains the halant and he subtracts 'A' from the letter before him
 upar jo baat `i' ke liye kahi gai he, waisi hi baat anya matraaon ke liyebhi lagu hoti he
 Hence: halant ek prakaar se ek rinatmak vastu he, thik vaise hi jiseki rinatmak sankhya 
 Just as adding a negative number to a positive number reduces the value of the positive number, similarly adding a halant to a letter preceding it reduces the value of it
 halant kaa prayog, bhartiya bhashaaon kii visheshta he
 Halant was invented in India, and perhaps this type of concept is not in any other language
 bharat main bhashaa par vishesh rup se kaary hua he, thik vaise hi jaise ki yunaan main gyomiti par
 India gave the concept of zero to the world, and in view of all this it seems that it would not be surprising if the concept of zero in India developed in language and went to mathematics
