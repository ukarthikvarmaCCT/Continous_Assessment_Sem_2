31 Jhumri Tilaiya is a small but famous town in Koderma district of Jharkhand province, located in Purvanchal, India
 jhumari tilaiya ko jhumari tilaiya ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The population here is around 70 thousand and the local residents basically speak Magahi
 jhumari tilaiya koderma jila mukhyalay se kareeb chha: kimi dur sthit he
 Jhumri Telaiya has about two dozen schools and colleges
 inamen se ek tilaiya sainik skool bhi he
 The Talaiya is associated with its name due to the Talaiya dam built to prevent the devastating floods in the Damodar River
 is baandh kii oonchai kareeb 100 feet or lambaai 1200 feet he
 Its reservoir is spread over an area of about 36 sq km
 kaaphi haraa-bharaa kshetra hone ke kaaran yah ek achche picnic sthal ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 There are many tourist places here including the waterfall Kund, Talaiya dam and Dhwajdhari mountain
 iske alaava rajgir, nalanda or hazaribagh rashtriya park anya najdiki paryaton sthal hai
 The nearest railway station to reach Jhumri Telaiya is Koderma which is situated on the New delhi-kolkata rail route
 jhumari tilaiya ko aksar ek kaalpanik sthaan samajhane kii bhul kar di jaati he lekin isaki khyaati kii pramukh vajah ek jamaane main yahaan kii abhrak khadaanon ke alaava yahaan ke radio premi shrotaaon kii badi sankhya bhi he
 Jhumri Talaiah's radio-savvy listener is best known for writing letters to Vividh Bharati's pharmacy shows
 jhumari tilaiya ek samay apane abarakh ke khadaanon ke liye mashhur tha
 In 1890, in order to lay the tracks of the Aspak railway of Koderma, the mines of Abarkha were discovered, the best type of abarkha has been extracted from its vicinity
 si ech privet limited chotu ram bhadaani or horil ram bhadaani abarakh ke khaanon ke agraj the, jinhe mica king bhi kaha gaya
 He had the largest share in asbestos mining and export during his time
 samrudh abhrak vyapaariyon ne jhumari tilaiya main kai bhavy bhawanon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Cars like Mercedes and Porsche were common in Jhumri Tilaiya in the late 1960s
 jhumari tilaiya ke naam ek samay sabase zyada phone line or phone karne kaa ricard bhi he
 The highest found in Abarkh Domchang, which was exported to Soviet Russia, was used in space and military operations there
 1990 ke dashak main soviet rus ke vighatan or krritrim abarakh kii khoj hone se yahaan ke udhogon ko ghaataa hone laga or khadaane dhire-dhire band hone lagi
 The huge mansion belongs to the mine owners, spreading over several acres of land, still to be found in the city
 mika kings 2007 ke rup main jhumari telaiya main abhi bhi sakriy the
 Apart from that business, in 1973-74, it was sometimes transferred to government corporations through a government enterprise called Bihar Mica Syndicate, which had mica mines in Sapahi, 40 km from Jhumri Tilaiya
 is sarkari udhyam kaa naam badalakar bihar rajya khanij vikaas nigam kar diya gaya, jise ab jharkhand rajya khanij vikaas nigam ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Mica mining through government corporations went well in the mid-1990s and gradually fell due to lack of demand / political will and changing times
 multah jhumari tilaiya ek khanan kasbaa tha, jo ki 1957 main apane vividh bharti se sambandh ke kaaran prasiddh hua
 While many TV channels and FM radio stations had not started in India, the programs of Vividh Bharati had become national events
 vividh bharti ke kaaryakramon main badi sankhya main anurodh jhumari tilaiya se aayaa karte the
 Young listeners of this town used to have a competition among themselves as to who gets the most requests in a day or month
 shrota, rameshwar barnwaal or nandalaal sinha to apana naam lagbhag pratidin is kaarykram main bulawaane main safal rahe
 Thus the audience of Vividh Bharati became familiar with the town of Jhumri Telaiya
 kuch log jhumari tilaiya ke astitv par hi shaq kiya karte the or sochate the ki yah ek kaalpanik kasbaa he
 This name has also been used to show insignificance in a funny accent
 jaise 'medical jarnal of jhumari tilaiya' kaa prayog praayah sasti va mahatvaheen medical jarnal ko jataane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In a way Jhumri Tilaiya is the Indian equivalent of Timbuktu, which is also considered a fictional place
 iskaa ullekh kai hindi filmon main dikhataa he
 Often, when the people of Jhumri Telaiya go for an interview, they are amazed that the town written in their bio-data is truly on this earth
 jhumari jharkhand main ek gaanv he, jabaki tilaiya shabd hindi shabd taal se aayaa he jiskaa matlab he talab
 It is also said that Jhumri is also a local folk dance
 kuch log yah bhi maanate hai ki isaki utpatti jhuri se hui he jo brush ke liye sthaneey shabd he, jiskaa prayog gaanv main khaanaa pakaane ke eendhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Another theory is that Jhumri Telaiya derives its name from its location between two different villages, Jhumri and Tilaiya Dam

 nutrino yah ek nayaa kan he jiskaa sarvapratham avishkaar san 1930 main pauli ne kiya tha
 The first theoretical basis of this particle was given by the famous physicist Fermi in 1934
 nutrino ke gun sankshep main nimnlikhit hai : While examining the reactions that make up the beta rays, it was observed that the energy spectrum of the protruding particles is different from the energy spectrum of the alpha ray
 elfaa kirane pruthak rekha varnakram ke anusaar milti hai, par beta kirane unase purnat: bhinn prakaar ke santat varnakram kaa anukaran karti hai
 The energy spectrum of the beta ray obtained for radium-e is shown in the figure
 beta kirnon kii urja kaa shunya se lekar adhiktam maan i a ke bich koi bhi maan ho saktaa he
 The same continuous spectrum is also found in the reactions from which positrons are obtained
 beta kirnon dwaara die santat varnakram kaa saidhantik aadhaar sthir karnaa bahut samay tak kathin samasya bana rahaa
 Suppose from a nucleus A, which is at the bottom of a particular energy, a beta ray emits and by this reaction another nucleus b is formed, which is again at the bottom of a particular energy
 puj evam urjasthirataa ke siddhant: ke anusaar, nikle hue beta kan kii urja nabhik k evam kha ke urjatalon k antar ke baraabar honi chahie
 This energy principle is always equal to e = mc2
 pariksha se kan shunaya se lekar E=mc2 tak sabhi maan kii urja lekar nikalate hai
 It seems that in such reactions some part of the energy is lost and the principle of mass and energy stability is violated
 is samasya ko fermi ne beta kiran ke baad vaali apni nutrino upakalpana dekar sarvapratham safaltaapurvak suljhaayaa
 He suggested that another particle, the neutrino, is also obtained in the beta-ray reactions and that the same dissipated energy is absorbed
 aaj tak pariksha se nutrino kii pahchaan nahin ho pai he, falat: iske gun aise hone chahie jinke kaaran isaki pahchaan ati kathin ho
 Therefore it was assumed that the neutrino is free of charge and its weight is much less than that of electrons, almost zero
 nutrino kaa aaveshrahit hona, beta kiran kii abhikriya ke liye aaveshasthirataa ke siddhant ke anusaar he
 According to the neutrino hypothesis, the amount of energy received in the beta ray reaction is e
 yah urja beta kan nutrino evam pratikshipt nabhik ko praapt hoti he
 The energy division among the three particles can be very different, hence the spectral spectrum is formed
 jab ek nabhik se beta kiran praapt hoti he, tab nabhik ke aavesh kaa ikai dwaara parivartan hoti he, tab nabhik ke aavesh kaa ikai dwaara parivartan hota he, bhaar aparivartit rahata he
 If an electron is obtained, then the number of protons in the nucleus increases by one unit and the number decreases by unit of unit by the cleavage unit
 usee bhanti yadi beta kiran abhikriya main ek positron praapt ho to proton sankhya ikai dwaara kam tathaa cliban sankhya main ikai kii vruddhi hoti he
 These beta adaptations can be explained in the following way: in abhikriyaaon main neutron ko proton, electron evam nutrino se bana hua nahin mana gaya he
 At the time of beta-emission, neutrons are instantly converted into three particles
 isi prakaar kaa nivartan beta +utsarjan main proton main ho jaataa he
 And other properties of neutrinos are also given by equations
 koniya gamata h / 2 maan lee jane par hi uski sthirataa kaa niyam thik thik ghatit hota he
 Similarly, information about statistics is also available
 sameekaran evam main yadi sankhyikee kii sthirataa dekhi jaay, to yah niyam tabhi satya thahartaa he jab nutrino fermi-diraaq sankhyikee kaa anusaran kare
 The neutrino hypothesis was also used to solve the problems of weathering of masons
 mu-meson jab ek electron main parivartit hota he tab beta-kiran abhikriya kii bhanti, mrami tathaa urja sthirataa ke niyam khandit ho jate hai
 For the correctness of these rules, the following method was suggested: usee prakaar elfaa-meson apkshay nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara dikhalaayaa ja saktaa he
 And there is no syntactic evidence against equations is bhanti nutrino dwaara beta kiran evam meson ke apkshya kii samasyaon kaa samaadhan hua he
 All the evidence for this particle is still indirect

 Although the Sagrada Familia falls within the Art Nouveau period, Nicholas Pevsner and Charles Renee mcintosh of Glasgow point out that Gaudí did not limit Art Nouveau to a floor decoration by moving it away from normal use, but rather as an integral part of the building's architecture
 made
 haalanki sagrada familia ke nirmaan main kabhi usko ek cathedral-jaisi girjaghar yaa bishap ke kaarysthal bananaa lakshya yaa uddeshy main nahin tha,, laa familia sagrada apane praarambhik samay se ek cathedral-jaisi girjaghar aakaar ke parisar ke rup main yojanabaddh thi
 The plan at the ground level was such that other churches in Spain such as Burgos Cathedral, Leon Cathedral and Seville Cathedral were already built
 katalan or kai anya europea gothic cathedral-jaisi girjagharon ke saath vibhinn samantaayein rakhte hue bhi sagrada familia in sabaki chaudaai kii tulana main kam he, jaise ki khidki ke nikat kaa sthaan kam hona, prathana ke liye ghoomane kaa sthal kam hona, saat maharaabon kaa ek saath hona, toweron kii sankhya main adhik hona, teen baithne ke sthaan or teenon kaa aakaar ek duusare se bhinn hona, vibhinn sthaalon kii sajaavat alag hona, aadi shaamil hai
 While it is common for large churches to have small churches and historic buildings around them, the construction of the Sagrada Familia is out of the box because it is surrounded by close-knit walls and tight paths that take the shape of a closed square, with all three entrance sites
 In a way, the buildings like the monastery remain a symbol
 is khaasiyat se hatakar yojana main villaar kii style se prabhavit rahi he, jisase spasht he ki gaudi kii nirmaan-yojana paaramparik girjaghar vaastukala se kisi bhi prakaar se hatakar nahin he

 2010 tak aath spaayeron kaa nirmaan ho chukaa he jo chaar nai tastomant ke lekhakon or chaar isa messiah ke janm prakat hone vaale santon ke naam par samarpit hai
 According to the 2005 'construction' report 'of the project's official website, the image signed by Gaudí suggests that Spaier Gaudí, dedicated to Maryam, must have been younger than the authors of the New Testament
 yah chitra haal hi main nagar abhilekhaagaar main paae gaye hai
 The height of the spiers will be adapted to Gaudi's intentions with the existing foundation
 iskaa aashwaasan 'nirmaan' report' main diya gaya tha
 The spiers of New Testament authors will be enhanced in stature by their traditional iconography such as an ox symbolizing St
 Luke, a winged man symbolizing Matthew, a hawk symbolizing John, and a lion marking the mark
 yasu messiah ke kendriya spayer ko ek vishaal cross dwaara unchaa kiya jayega; in sabake kaaran spayer kii kul oonchaai 170 kii tulana main ek meter kam ho jayega
 It is lower in height than the Monticuque hill of Barcelona because the Gaudis did not want} their building to compete with the height of God

 Built between 1894 and 1930, the site symbolizing the birth of Christ was the first to be completed in this church

 Here it is decorated with scenes to remind you of various elements of his life
 gaudi kii prakritik style kii visheshta yah he ki murtiyan prayek rup se apane swayan ke tareeke main ek pratik ke saath sajaae gaye hai
 For example, the three ridges are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each is a small tortoise or a large tortoise
 kachhue or unke pratikon ke vipareet, do girggit pratik bhi paae jate hai jo parivartan ke pratik hai
 This emblem bears the light of the rising sun towards the north-east, which is considered to be the sign of the birth of Christ
 yah tin dharmik punya kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jinamein se prayek fik chat ke madhyam se vibhajit hota he
 The tree of life moves from the top of Christ's door, representing charity
 chaar tower is pratik sthal ko puraa karte hai or inamen se har ek vibhinn rup se sant mathais, saint baranbas, jud or shamaun kanani ke naamon par samarpit kiye gaye hai
 It was originally intended by Gaudí that the emblem should be multicolored and each mahrab painted with a wide array of colors
 usne har murti or rang dena chahta tha
 For this reason, the images of humans seem even more alive, as is felt in the statues of plants and animals
 gaudi ne puure girjaghar kii sanrachana or sajaavat kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye is pratik sthal ko chunaa he
 He was well aware that he would never complete the church in his lifetime
 parantu dusron ko apane kaary main apnaane ke liye ek kalatmak or vaastukala udhaaharan sthapit karne kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar chuke the
 They believed that if they started building the symbol of affection before the birthplace of Jesus Christ, it would look stern and uncontrollable and people would turn a face when they saw it

 The site is dedicated to the tortures that Jesus suffered during his crucifixion during his crucifixion
 yah pratik sthal aadmi ke paapon ko chitrit karne ke iraade se bhi banaaya gaya tha
 Its construction began in 1954 which was based on the paintings by Gaudí
 in toweron ko 1976 main puraa kiya gaya tha
 In 1987 Joseph began making various scenes under the leadership of Maria Subirachs
 pratik sthalon main bada or sabase chaunkaa dene vaala nirmaan yah badai kaa pratik sthal ho saktaa he jiskaa nirmaan 2002 main shuru hua tha
 The site is dedicated to the heavenly glory of Christ and shows the path to God: death, final judgment, and brag
 jabaki bain ore nark un logon ke liye he jo bhagwaan ke maarg se dur hat jaaen
 Knowing that he would not survive the completion of the construction, Gaudí prepared a specimen that was demolished in 1936
 isi praapt kuch mul ansh is pratik sthal pariyojna ke vikaas main kaam aae the
 One part of the church may have to be completely demolished to construct this symbol site
 is pratik sthal main maut or ishwar ko jawaab dena bhi dikhaae jaayenge
 The inner column of the church shows a unique gaudy shape

 It is the largest tributary of the Ganges River which originates from a place called Yamunotri and joins the Ganges at Prayag
 isaki pramukh sahaayak nadiyon main chambal, senger, choti sindh, batawa or ken ullekhneey hai
 Apart from Delhi and Agra, Etawah, Kalpi, Hamirpur and Prayag are the main cities of Yamuna

 Yamuna has an important place in the culture of Braj
 yah yamunotri naamak jagah se nikalati he
 It is the largest tributary of the Ganges River
 yamuna kaa udgam sthaan himalay ke himachhadit shrang bandarpuchh oonchaai 6200 meter se 7 se 8 mile uttar-pashchim main sthit kalind parvat he, jiske naam par yamuna ko kalindja athwa kalindi kaha jaataa he
 For several miles ahead of its origin, its stream flows uninterruptedly across the huge glaciers and snow-capped tubers and descends very steeply from the mountain slopes, manifested by the Yamunotri mountain
 vahaan iske darshanath hajaaron shraddhalu yatri prativarsh bharat varsh ke kone-kone se pahonchte hai
 Coming out of the Yamunotri mountain, this river flows in many mountainous rates and valleys and continues to cover small mountainous rivers like Vadier, Kamalad, Vadri Aslaur, and Tons in its zone
 uske baad yah himalay ko chhod kar doon kii ghati main pravesh karti he
 It flows for several miles southwest from there and takes small rivers called Giri, Sirmaur and Asha in its lap, it comes to the ground near Faizabad village in the present Saharanpur district, about 95 miles from its origin

 Thus she is the mother of Brajwasis in the true sense
 atah braj main ise yamuna maiyaa kehete he
 In the Brahma Purana, the explanation of the spiritual form of the Yamuna is presented - "the basis of creation and what is called the Sachchidananda Swarupa from the Lakshnas, the Upanishads who have sung in the Brahman form, the ultimate reality is Sakshata Yamuna
 gaudiy vidwaan shri rup goswami ne yamuna ko saakshaat chidanandmayi batalaaya he

 In the river near Delhi, this maximum depth is 68 feet
 agra main, yah gaharaai 3 foot tak hai
 Where there is a flow of Yamuna in the field at this time, it has not always flowed

 Of the many places it has changed during its good life, only a small amount of information has been received
 pragaaitihaasik kaal main yamuna madhuban ke sameep bahati thi, jahaan uske tat par shatrughan ji ne sarvapratham mathura nagari kii sthapana kii thi
 Its details are found in Valmiki Ramayana and Vishnu Purana
 1 krishna kaal main yamuna kaa pravaah katra keshav dev ke nikat tha
 European scholar Tavernier, who visited India in the seventeenth century, had observed by looking at the land near Katra that there was a stream of Yamuna at some time
 is sandarbh main grouz kaa mat he ki aitihaasik kaal main katra ke sameep yamuna ke pravaahit hone kii sambhaavna kam he, kintu atyant pracheen kaal main vahaan yamuna avashya thi
 2 It also proves that during the Krishna period, the flow of Yamuna was close to Katra
 kanidham kaa anumaan he, yannani lekhakon ke samay main yamuna kii pradhan dhara yaa uski ek badi shakha katra keshav dev kii purvi diwaal ke neeche bahati hogi
 3 Jav went on extensive propagation of Buddhism in Mathura and here many sandharams were built on both sides of the Yamuna, the main stream of Yamuna would flow from Katra to the place where it is now, but there is no branch or subsidiary Katra
 Was also present near aisa anumaan he, yamuna kii vah shakha buddha kaal ke bahut baad tak sambhawatah solahavin shatabdi tak keshav dev mandir ke neeche bahati rahi thi
 The first two rainy rivers 'saraswati' and 'krishna Ganga' flow into the western part of Mathura and fall into the Yamuna, which commemorates the Saraswati Sangam of the Yamuna and the ghat called Krishna Ganga
 sambhav he yamuna kii un sahaayak naadiyon main se hi koi katra ke paas bahati rahi ho
 It is known from the talk literature of Vallabh sect that the river Yamuna used to flow near Jamunavati village in Saraswat Kalpa
 us kaal main yamuna nadi kii do dharaain thi, ek dhara nandagaanv, varasanaa, sanket ke nikat bahati hui govardhan main jamunaavati par aati thi or duusari dhara pirghat se hoti hui gokul kii ore chali jaati thi
 Further, both streams used to move towards present Agra

 Although it is hard to believe
 shri gangaaprasad kamthaan ne brajabhasha ke ek musalmaan bhakt kavi karbeg upmaan kaare kaa vrutant prakashit kiya he
 According to Kabeg's statement, he was a resident of village Parasauli on the banks of the Jamuna and had created his work in 1717
 vartmaan samay main saharanpur jile ke faijabad gaanv ke nikat maidan main aane par yah aage 65 mile tak badhati hui haryana ke ambala or karnal jilon ko uttar pradesh ke saharanpur or mujffarnagar jilon se alag karti he
 In this terrain, rivers named Mascara, Kath, Hindon and Sabi are found, due to which its size increases greatly
 maidan main aate hi isse purvi yamuna nahar or pashchimi nahar nikaali jaati hai
 Both these canals take water from Yamuna and make the earth green and rich in hundreds of miles of this land
 is bhu-bhaag main yamuna kii dhara ke donon ore punjab or uttar pradesh ke kai chote bade nagaron kii seemayen hai, kintu iske thik tat par basaa hua sabase pracheen or pehla nagar dilli he, jo lambe samay se bharat kii rajdhani he
 It reaches a place called Okhla, catering to the needs of millions of male and female residents of Delhi and sweeping away the filth
 yahan par is par ek bada baandh baandha gaya he jisase nadi kii dhara puri tarah niyantrit kar lee gayi he
 From this dam comes the Agra Canal, which irrigates hundreds of miles of land in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh
 dilli se aage yah haryana or uttar pradesh kii seemaa banaati hui tathaa haryana ke faridabad jile ko uttar pradesh ke gajiabad jile se alag karti hui uttar pradesh main pravaahit hone lagati he
 The first entry of Yamuna river into the cultural boundary of Braj region is near the town called 'jaber' of Khurja tehsil of Bulandshahar district
 vahaan se yah dakshin kii ore bahati hui faridabad jile kii palaval tehsil or aligarh, uttar pradesh ke hathras jile kii khayr tehsil kii seemaa nirmit karti he
 It then enters Mathura district near Shahpur village of Umbrella tehsil and sets the boundary of Umbrella and Bhatt tehsils of Mathura district
 jebar se shergarh tak yah dakshinabhimukh pravaahit hoti he uske baad kuch purv kii ore mud jaati he
 Shergarh is the first notable place situated on the banks of Yamuna in the Braj region
 shergarh se kuch dur tak purv kii disha main bah kar phir yah mathura tak dakshin disha main hi bahati he
 On both sides of the route, Puranas are famous forest and park and Krishna Leela place
 yahan par yah bhant se vrindavan tak bal khaati hui bahati he or vrindavan ko yah teen ore se gher leti he
 It is known from the Puranas, in ancient times, there were many streams of Yamuna in Vrindavan, due to which it became almost like a peninsula
 usamen anek sundar vankhand or ghaas ke maidan the, jahaan bhagwaan shri krishna apane saathi gop baalkon ke saath gaayen charaaya karte the
 In the present day there is only one stream of Yamuna and Vrindavan is situated on its banks
 vahaan madhya kaal main anek dharmacharyon or bhakt kaviyon ne nivas kar krishnopasna or krishna bhakthi kaa prachaar kiya tha
 There are large beautiful ghats on the banks of the Yamuna in Vrindavan and there are many temples-shrines, chhatris and dharamshalas on them
 inase yamuna ke tat kii shobhaa adhik bad jaati he
 Flowing further south from Vrindavan, this river enters the city of Mathura
 mathura yamuna ke tat par basaa hua ek esa aitihaasik or dharmik sthaan he, jisaki dirghakalin gaurav gaatha prasiddh he
 Here Lord Krishna took an avatar, due to which its importance has increased
 yahan bhi yamuna ke tat par bade sundar ghat bane hue hai
 a panoramic view of Mathura city and its ghats is seen in Yamuna by boat or by bridge
 mathura main yamuna par do pakke pul bane hai jinamein se ek par railgadee chalati he tathaa duusare par sadak parivahan chalate hai
 Gokul barrage has now also been constructed on the southern border of Mathura city with the objective of bringing back the ground water level of Braj and making the fertile land of Braj more and more irrigated
 vigat kaal main yamuna mathura-vrindavan main ek vishaal nadi ke rup main pravaahit hoti thi, kintu jabase isse naharen nikaali gayi hai, tab se iskaa jaleey aakaar chota ho gaya he
 It takes its predecessor form only in rain
 us samay milon tak iskaa pani fail jaataa he
 Further from Mathura, on the left bank of the Yamuna there are religious places like Gokul and Mahavan and on the right bank there are villages like Aurangabad and Farah
 yahan tak yamuna ke kinare retile hai, kintu aage patharile or chattaani ho jate hai, jisase jal dhara bal khaati hui manoram rup main pravaahit hoti he
 The Yamuna near the village of Akos in Sadabad tehsil runs out of the boundary of Mathura district and then forms the boundary of Mathura and Agra districts to some extent
 sadabad tehsil ke mandaur gram ke paas yah agra jile main pravesh karti he
 There, rivers called Karban and Gambhir come together
 agra jile main pravesh karne par nagala akos ke paas iske pani se nirmit keetham jhil he, jo sailaaniyon ke liye badi aakarshak he
 a protected forest block has been constructed along the banks of the Yamuna from Keetham to Runkata, which is called 'surdas Forest'
 runakta ke sameep hi yamuna tat par 'goghaat' kaa vah pracheen dharmik sthal he, jahaan mahatma surdaas ne 12 varshon tak nivas kiya tha or jahaan unhone mahaprabhu ballabhacharya se diksha lee thi
 Among the coastal places of Yamuna, Agra is the largest city after Delhi
 yah ek prasiddh aitihaasik, vyapaarik env paryaton sthal he, jo mughal samraaton kii rajdhani bhi rah chukaa he
 It is situated at a great height from the Yamuna coast - Yamuna flows in the eastern part of Delhi, from north to south
 yahan par bhi yamuna par do pul nirmit hai
 The buildings on the Yamuna coast in Agra, the fort built by the Mughal emperors and the Taj Mahal are very famous for tourists
 agra nagar se aage yamuna ke ek ore firozabad or duusari ore fatehbaad jila or tehsil sthit he
 After them comes the famous religious and historical site of Bateshwar, where the cultural boundary of Braj ends
 bateshwar kaa pracheen naam 'saurapur' he, jo bhagwaan shri krishna ke pitamah shur kii rajdhani thi
 Here, the Yamuna has taken a big turn with force, making Bateshwar known as an island
 is sthaan par karthik poornama ko yamuna snaan kaa ek bada mela lagata he
 Beyond Bateshwar, Etawah is situated on the banks of the Yamuna as a city
 yah bhi agra or bateshwar kii bhanti oonchaai par basaa hua he
 The high banks on the banks of the Yamuna are not in the plain as much as in the districts of Agra and Etawah
 itawa se aage madhya pradesh kii prasiddh nadi chambal yamuna main aakar milti he, jisase iskaa aakaar visteern ho jaataa he, apane udgam se lekar chambal ke sangam tak yamuna nadi, ganga nadi ke samaanaantar bahati he
 Further, the difference between them becomes less and in the end they go to Prayag and they both get confluent
 chambal ke pashchaat yamuna nadi main milane vaali nadiyon main senger, choti sindh, batawa or ken ullekhneey hai
 After Etawah, Kalpi, Hamirpur and Prayag are the main towns of the Yamuna
 prayag main yamuna ek vishaal nadi ke rup main prastut hoti he or vahaan ke prasiddh aitihaasik kile ke neeche ganga main mil jaati he
 a huge bridge has been built over the Yamuna at Prayag, which is two storeyed
 ise uttar pradesh kaa vishaltam sethu mana jaataa he
 Due to the confluence of Yamuna and Ganga, Prayag has gained the importance of Tirtharaj
 yamuna nadi kii kul lambaai udgam se lekar prayag sangam tak lagbhag 860 mile he
 Yamuna is counted along with the Ganges in the most sacred and ancient rivers of India
 yamuna or ganga ke do aab kii punyabhumi main hi aaryon kii puraatan samskruti kaa gauravshaalee rup ban sakaa tha
 Yamuna is the only important river of Brajmandal
 jahaan tak braj samskruti kaa sambadh he, yamuna ko keval nadi kahana hi paryaapt nahin he
 In fact, it has been a subsidiary of Braj culture, inspiring its long tradition and the mainstay of its religious sentiment
 puranic anushrutiyon ke anusaar yah dem main yamuna ji ke ek hajaar naamon se uski pashasti kaa gayan kiya gaya he
 3 The devotees of Yamuna recite it daily every day
 brajabhasha ke bhakt kaviyon or visheshtah vallabh sampradaayi kaviyon ne giriraaj govardhan kii bhanti yamuna ke prati bhi atishay shraddha vyakt kii he
 There is hardly a poet of this community, who has not paid his poetic tribute to his Yamuna
 unka yamuna stuti sambandhi sahitya brajabhasha bhakthi kavy kaa ek ullekhneey ang he

 Along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, they are also counted among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although some members of the band have tried not to classify themselves in any one genre
 is band ne shastreey sangeet, bluez-rock, pop or unnatisheel rock tatwon ko bhi shaamil kiya
 They were once listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's highest-voiced band, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide
 VH1 ke greatest artists of hard rock kaarykram main deep purple ko 22waan sthaan pradaan kiya gaya tha
 The band has gone through several changes from member circles and an eight-year hiatus

 unke baad satr guitaravadak ritchi blackmor ko shaamil kiya gaya jinhen nae samooh ke liye audishan dene ke liye hamburg se laut aane ke liye raji kiya gaya tha
 Curtis was quickly dismissed, but Heck Enterprise, as well as Lord and Blackmore, were eager to continue
 baas guitar ke liye, lord ne apane mitra nik simpar ke naam kaa suzav diya jinke saath milakar unhone 1967 main band main apana vaadan prastut kiya tha jise da flower pot main and der garden kaha jaataa tha
 Simpler's claim to fame was because he was in Johnny Kid and the Pirates and was with Kid in a car accident in which he died
 vah blackmor ke saath screeming lord sach ke da saivejez main bhi the jisamen unhone blackmor ke saath kaam kiya
 The troupe was completed by The Maze vocalist Rod Evans and drummer Ian Pace
 1968 ke vasant main denmark ke ek chote-se daure ke baad, blackmor ne ek nae naam: deep purple kaa suzav diya jo unki daadi ji kaa pasandida geet tha
 In October 1968, the group was successful in collaboration with Joe South's "hush", which finished fourth on the US Billboard chart and second on the Canadian RPM chart
 The song was taken from their debut album Shades of Deep Purple and Cream was registered to support her on her Goodbye tour

 In his quest to fill the singer's position, Blackmore engaged 19-year-old singer Terry Reid based on his experience who turned down the opportunity for the newly formed Led Zeppelin
 haalanki use "flatering" main mauka diya gaya lekin read abhi bhi apane nirmaataa miki most ke saath vishesh anubandh ke prati pratibandhit tha or ekaaki kariyar banane kii uski bahut adhik ruchi thi
 Blackmore had no choice but to look elsewhere
 band ne episod sicks se ian gilaan gayak ko le liya jisane britain main bahut badi vanijyik safalataa praapt kiye bina ek-ek kar anek album prakashit kiye
 sicks ke drum vadak mik underwood-blackmor ke bachapan ke sahpaathee ne parichay diya or bosavadak ] This brought Deep Purple into the second category of critical status, before which the publication of the greenway-cook tune entitled "haleluja" was unflattering which flopped

 da naaise dwaara five brijez ke saath, haalanki yah rock band or kisi orcasta ke bich pehla sahyog tha lekin phir bhi samay samay par deep purple ke kuch log isse bahut adhik khush nahin the kyonki is par ek sawalia nishaan "ek samooh orcasta vaale logon ke saath milakar kaary kiya" lag gaya tha, is baat ne band ko or bhi adhik tangi, hord rocking style main laakar khadaa kar diya
 iske baavjood, lord ne likhaa ki band ne 1970 ke dashak ke ant main isi kaary main lipt duusare orcasta / samooh ke sahyog se jaimini sweet record kiya
 Soon after the orchestra was published, the band began a very busy tour and recording which brought some relief for the next three years
 His first studio album of this time was released in the mid-1970s, with In Rock released in the summer of 1971
 "strange kind of vuman" kii tarah tital trek "firebal" ko na ki album se balki unheen satron ke dauraan record kiye gaye ek ekal ke rup main release kiya gaya 
 Within weeks of the release of Fireball, the band began performing songs planned for the next album
 a song presented at the first gig of the fireball tour that was being written on a bus to an event in Portsmouth that was written in response to a journalist's question was: "how do you write songs? " Three months later, in December 1971, the band traveled to Switzerland for the recording of Machine Head
 The album was to be recorded at a casino in Montreux using Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, but a fire during a gig from Frank Zappa and the Mother of Invention burned the casino to ashes
 The recording of the album was actually done at the nearby empty Grand Hotel
 is ghatana ne "smoke on da water" naamak gane ko suvidit rup se prerit kiya
 Gillan believes he commented on Mother's Mark Wolman: "arthur Brown in Person!" During the concert, a man was seen wielding a flare gun on the wall ceiling
 jahaan se donon pichley albamon ko chhod diya gaya tha, vahaan se jari rahete hue uske baad se mashin head band ke sabase prasiddh albamon main se ek ban gaya he, jisamen ve trek shaamil hai jo live clasix, jaise - "haive star", "spes trekking", "lezi" or "smoke on da water", ban gaye, deep purple sabase prasiddh gaanaa he
 Deep Purple continued touring and recording at a pace that would have been rare in thirty years: when Machine Head was recording, the group had only been together for three and a half, yet it was their seventh LP
 isi bich band ne 1972 main chaar uttar america daure or japan ke agast daure kaa jimmaa liya
 This August tour paved the way for a dual-vinyl live release, Made in Japan
 In fact, its worldwide release immediately saw the double LP becoming a hit song, even though it was intended to be recorded only in Japan
 It remains one of the most popular and best-selling live concert recordings of rock music
 paaramparik deep purple mark II sadsy-mandali ne kaam karnaa jari rakhaa or 1973 main hu du ve think ve aar naamak album ko release kiya jisamen "vuman from tokio" naamak hit ekal bhi shaamil tha lekin us samay pehle kii tulana main adhik aatanrik tanaav or khalipan nazar aayaa
 Gillan had to leave the band due to the tussle that arose between Gillan and Blackmore following their second tour of Japan in the summer of 1973, and Glover was also under pressure with them
 Auditions were held

 He then relied on Coverdale and Glenn Hughes
 Coverdale was an unknown singer from Saltburn in northeast England and Hughes Midlands, formerly of the Tropies, was a bassist / singer

 is nai sadsy-mandali kaa astitv 1974 main kaayam tha jinhone bern naamak ek or adhik heavi blue rock album ko release kiya jo ek anya atyadhik safal release or vishwa daura tha
 Hughes and Coverdale added both vocal synergy and a more chirpy element to the band's music, a sound that was even more pronounced than the Stormbringer released in late 1974
 tital trek ke alaava is album main anginat gane the jinka bahut adhik radio prasaaran hua, jaise - "ladi dabl dealer", "da jeepsi" or "soljar of fortune"
 phir bhi blackmor ne deep purple ke album or nirdesan main dukhad awaz pradaan kiya or bas yahi kaha, "mujhe jhankaar bhari praan sangeet pasand nahin he
 "that's why he left the band in the summer of 1975 to form his own band with Ronnie James Dio of the Elf
 His newly formed name was Richie Blackmore's Rainbow, which was later shortened to Rainbow after an album

 maanvon main yah kaary mukhyatah baanjhapan kii chikitsa ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he jabaki gaay-bhais evam anya pashuon main prajnan ke saamaanya vidhi ke rup main prayukt hota he
 There are many techniques of artificial insemination in women- intra uterine inasemination takanic sahaj shabdon main kahe to kritrim garbhaadhan prakriya ke madhyam se ni:santan danpati bhi santan praapt kar sakate he
 Physical deficiencies of men are also responsible for the condition of infertility
 jaise unke veery main shukranu sankhya kii kami, shukranu ke baahar nikalne main baadha, veery main sankraman, shukranu kii gati main kami aadi
 Conversely, in women, underdevelopment of the uterus, loss of ovaries such as non-ovulation or lump, diseases related to the uterine face, vaginal narrowing are some of the main reasons
 iyuai takanic main fallopian tub kaa saamaanya hona jaruri he
 Under this method, the woman is first given such medicines, due to which the egg starts to form more in it
 isse garbh thaharne ke avasar bad jate he
 After this, through ultrasound, find out on which day of the month the egg is released and to control it, an injection is made, which removes the egg exactly 36 hours later
 isse yah anumaan lagaana aasaan hota he ki kis samay shukranu ko garbh main pravesh karaayaa jaae
 The test method of this egg production is called follicular monitoring
 is bich purush ke shukranu ko lekar use sahi tarah se saaf kar liya jaataa he or vishesh takanic se use gadha kiya jaataa he
 This increases sperm quality and motility
 andanu nikalne ke samay is shukranu ko garbh main daalaa jaataa he
 In such a situation, the chances of pregnancy are 40 to 60 percent
 iyuai takanic kaa prayog us samay bhi kiya jaataa he, jabaki purush main shukranu bilkul nahin hote athwa dawa ke prayog karne ke baad bhi unki sankhya nahin badhati
 In this case, sperm from a donor is used
 shukranu ko andar daalane ke baad ek nishchit avadhi ke antaraal par baraabar dekhnaa padataa he ki shukranu se andanu mila yaa nahin? agar nahin miltaa he to phir dobaaraa is prakriya ko karnaa padataa he
 After conception of sperm, medicines are given for 'luteal support' and the woman is advised to rest
 is prakriya ke 12 se 16 din ke andar garbhaadhan ko sunishchit kiya jaataa he
 Artificial semen, 'artificial reproduction' or 'artificial insemination', refers to the female animal being implanted by a yantra or squirrel instead of naturally conceived
 svachh or surakshit rup se ekatra nar pashu ke veery ko is prakriya main jananendriya athwa prajnan maarg main pravesh karakar maadaa pashu ko garbhit kiya jaataa he
 In this way, children born through artificial insemination are as strong and strong as children born naturally

 a French veterinarian described it as an excellent means of eliminating animal breeds
 professor hollman ne kaha ki prakritik garbhaadhan ke saath hi yadi kritrim viryasechan kaa bhi prayog kiya jaae to garbhaadhan praaia: nishchit hoga
 Established a laboratory of artificial reproduction from Einbahf in Russia in 1909 and in 1912 AD performed artificial semen in the vagina of 39 horses
 unamem 31 ghodiyon garbhit hui
 At the same time, naturally, 23 other rings were also conceived, but only 10 of them conceived
 isse kritrim viryasechan kii mahatta pramanit hui or iskaa prayog badhane laga tathaa anya pashuon, yatha-bhed, gaay or kute aadi main bhi kritrim viryasechan kiya jane laga
 In the United States in 1896 AD, 19 dogs had semen in their vagina, of which 15 were conceived and had children
 is prayog ke falswaroop kritrim viryasechan ko europe or america ne badi shighrata se apanaaya
 The use of this method is increasing rapidly in the whole world - England, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, Canada, China and Russia etc
 bharat main kritrim viryasechan 1942 i
 main bhartiya pashu chikitsa anusandhan sanstha main aarambh hua
 Subsequently, many of its centers opened in Bengal, Bihar, Punjab, Madras, Madhya Pradesh, Bombay and Uttar Pradesh
 is samay bharat main sahasron kritrim viryasechan centre hai or inaki sankhya prati varsh badhati ja raheen he
 Now millions of animals are conceived every year with this experiment
 iske liye veery kai reeti se ekatrit kiya jaataa he : kritrim yoni, yantric prahastan tathaa vidyut uddipan aadi dwaara
 It is best to perform artificial insemination immediately after collecting the semen
 yadi tatkaal kritrim viryasechan na kiya ja sake to veery ko svachh hatajeevanu kachakupi, yaa parakhnalee main surakshit band karke, thande main, 1
3 se 2
5 sein
 par rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In this manner, semen remains insemination for three to five days
 veery main anek prakaar ke vilyanon ko milakar mandit bhi kiya jaataa he; kintu prayog se siddh hua he ki amandit veery hi adhik upyogi he
 Semen is stored in a special manner by dry ice
 veery ko upyog main laane se pehle use pighla liya jaataa he
 There is a lot of research work done on semen and its use in different parts of the world
 is prayog se vishesh yuva saandon kaa veery ek desh se duusare deshon main aasaani se bheja ja saktaa he
 And can easily be found for use at all times
 is prakaar se jamaaya hua veery safaltaapurvak do varsho tak upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 At the time when the female animal is warm, the semen collected by lifting her tail is put into her vagina by the atomizer
 prakruti ke anusaar har maadaa pashu nishchit samay par garam hoti rahati he or yah samay har pashu ke liye alag-alag hota he, jaise gaay, bhens or ghodi 21 wein din garam hoti hai
 The time of staying warm also varies among different animals
 gaay or bhens main yah keval 12 se 18 ghante tak rahata he or ghodi main lagbhag ek saptaah tak
 When the hot state is over, naturally or artificially, the semen does not stay in the womb
 prakritik kisi bhi dhang se garbhaadhan kiya jaae, jab pashu main garbh thahar jaataa he tab 21wein din garam padana band ho jaataa he
 It has been observed that in female animals, 50-60 percent of the womb is located at one time
 kritrim viryasechan dugdhotpaadan or pashusudhaar tathaa pashusampatti badhaane ke liye sugam or aavashyak he
 The growth of the animal depends only on the good bull
 yadi saand acchhee jati kaa he to uske bachche bhi balvan or adhik doodh denevaale honge
 It has been observed that milk production has been continuously improving for four to five generations
 yadi nimnakoti kii, do ser dugdh denevaali gaay aise saand se, jisaki maan 16 ser doodh detii thi, garbhit kii jaae to duusari peedi main 12 ser, chauthi peedi main 14 ser or paanchavin peedi main 16 ser ke lagbhag doodh milane lagegaa
 Good bulls are hard to send; But the best and high quality bull's semen can be easily available from country longitudes, according to modern scientific methods, all the time
 prakritik dhang se ek saand saal main keval 100 gauon ko garbhit kar saktaa he; kritrim reeti se usee saand se 1,000 ko garbhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Because once collected semen can conceive at least 8-10 cows and kept in refrigeration, it remains fully powerful for at least three to four days
 bahut se saand dekhne main to hatte katte dikhaai dete hai, kintu veery main kharabi hone ke kaaran unase garbh nahin thahartaa
 There is no fear of this in artificial way because before and after conception, the semen is fully tested
 kritrim viryasechan se gaay, bhens-ghodi aadi kii jananendriyon main rog nahin hote, jo saamanyat: rogi saandon ke sansarg se ho jate hai
 Small cows, buffaloes etc
 can be used for semen of the largest bulls of high quality bulls for the smallest cows etc
 kritrim viryasechan dwaara luli, langadi, chotahi or bekaar gaay, bhens ghodi aadi ko bhi garbhit karke bachche praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 There are many benefits of artificial insemination as compared to natural insemination, the major benefits of which are: kritrim garbhaadhan ke anek laabh hone ke baavjood is vidhi kii apni kuch simaayen hai jo mukhyatah nimna prakaar hai

 In the midst of all this, VP Menon once again came to Bhopal, in clear words to the Nawab that Bhopal cannot remain independent, from the geographical, moral and cultural point of view, Bhopal is closer to Malwa, so Bhopal will have to be a part of Madhya Bharat
 
 aakhirkaar 29 janvari 1949 ko nawab ne mantrimandal ko barkhaast karte hue satta ke saare sutara ek baar phir se apane haath main le liye

 Zuma also got involved in a corruption-related controversy after his financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was accused of corruption and fraud
 us samay lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshak rahe bulilani ngakuka zuma or ANC mukhya sachetak tony yengeni ke khilaaf takat kaa durupyog karne ke iljaamon kii jaanch kar rahe the
 In 2004, Zuma became a prominent figure in the Schabir Shaik trial

 During the trial, Shack was shown requesting a bribe of 500 000 rand per year for Zuma in support of Zuma's defense contractor Thomson CSF, which is recorded in the infamous "encrypted fax"
 2 june 2005 ko, shaike ko doshi paaya gaya or 15 saal kii sajaa sunai gai
 Judge Hillary Squires gives a detailed account of several transactions between Shack and Zuma, with a summary that "all the accused companies have been used to pay Jacob Zuma at one time"
 The media incorrectly quoted Squires' statement with the phrase "a generally corrupt relationship", while the exact same word does not exist in court transcripts
 is vaakyansh kii shuruyaat karne waalon kii pratiraksha main, shaike ke khilaaf faisle ke sampoorn pratilekh main vastav main zuma kaa zikr 471 baar hua he, "bhrasht" yaa "bhrashtachar" shabd kaa prayog 54 baar kiya gaya he or isamen aise 12 vaakya hai jinamein "bhrasht" or "zuma" donon shabdon kaa prayog ek saath he
 Later media sources changed the phrase to "mutually beneficial symbiosis", which was replaced by Article 235 of the verdict, which was: "to think it would be against common sense and ordinary human nature to benefit from the accusations of Zuma
" Was not realized, which was getting far more than before 1997; and even if nothing was ever said between them that could help mutually beneficial symbiosis Is installed, which can generate a sense of in only thanks to a series of continuing in accordance with the evidence was there, its conditions to start and these payments after the recipient

 Following the Shack trial, Zuma was formally accused of corruption by the National Prosecuting Authority
 sthagan ke liye abhiyojan paksh dwaara daayar aavedan ke khaarij ho jane ke baad maamle ko petermarittsburg hai court se waapas le liye gaya
 Zuma's legal team continued to delay the action and despite Zuma's assertion that he wished to look into the matter in court, he managed to conceal some important evidence from the court that resulted in the prosecution's adjournment on the due date Had to file an application for 8 navambar 2007 ko supreme court of apil ne rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ke paksh main apana nirnay sunaaya jo zuma ke raksha dal dwaara kiye hue vibhinn khoj or jabti sambandhi kaaryon ke sambandh main tha or unke dwaara kiye gaye chaar apilon ko kaarij kar diya gaya
 The decision was in relation to obtaining a personal diary of a senior member of a French arms company by the National Prosecuting Authority, which provided information related to Zuma's corrupt practices, possibly while awarding an arms deal
 28 disambar 2007 ko, scorpian ne zuma par ucch nyaayalay main thag-vyapaar, kaale dhan ko vaid karne, bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi ke vibhinn maamalon main abhiyog chalaaya
 a conviction and imprisonment of more than 1 year would have made Zuma ineligible for election to the South African Parliament and consequently he would have been disqualified for the presidency of South Africa
 4 agast 2008 ko zuma adaalat main haazir hue
 12 sitambar 2008 ko petermarittsburg nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke bataaya ki zuma par lage bhrashtachar ke aarope prakriyaatmak aadhaar par avaidh hai kyonki lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshaalay ne aarope lagane kaa nirnay lene se pehle zuma ko abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka nahi diya or rajya ko kanoonee bhugtan karne ke nirdesh die
 Nikholson also stated that, he believed that political interference played a role in the decision to file charges again against Zuma, although he did not explain why he dismissed the allegations against Zuma as invalid
 nikholson ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki unka nirnay zuma ke aparaadh yaa nirparaadh se sambandhit nahin tha, balki yah keval ek prakriyaatmak aadhaar par tha
 Various media reports have misinformed that the charges against Zuma have been dismissed
 maamla yah nahin tha
 The NDPP was able to re-accuse Zuma, however, only once he was given the opportunity to present a representation to the NDPP, based on the ndpp's decision to do so
 In paragraph 47 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson wrote, abhyavedan ko sunne kii baadhyataa audi alterum partem ke siddhant kaa ek hissaa he
 The requirement is that a person who may be adversely affected by a decision may be given an opportunity to make a representation with a view to achieving a favorable outcome
 The affected person should usually be informed of the essence or elements of the case to which he or she has to respond
 adaalat ne yah nirdhaarit kiya ki NDPP ke samvidhan kii dhara 179 main ullikhit prakriya kaa paalan kar paane kii vifaltaa ne NDPP dwaara zuma par punah aarope lagane ke nirnay ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 Judge Nicholson found that various estimates could be made at the time of the allegations leveled against Zuma which corroborated the conclusion that it contained some degree of political interference by the executive branch of the government
 nyaayadhish nikholson apane nirnay ke para 210 main likhte hai, After the President's political defeat in Polokwane, the timing of the indictment by Mr Emsche on 28 December 2007 was the most unfortunate

 In Article 220 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson further wrote, raajnneetik hastkshep, dabaav yaa prabhaav ke sanketon se upar uth kar jo vyavhaar maine nirdhaarit kiye hai unamem ek chintajanak dhaancha he
 It began with the "political leadership" given by Minister Maduna to Mr
 Ngcuka when he refused to prosecute the applicant, whose crime was to talk to and meet with Thint representatives and other matters that i have referred to
 Given the rule of evidence, the court is bound to accept the conclusion that is least suited to the interest of the party who has special knowledge of the facts
 yah nishchit rup se yengeni maamle main ullikhit "suraag yaa suzav" ke raajnneetik hastkshep se adhik prabal he
 It is a matter of grave concern that such a process took place in New South Africa and prompted destruction under apartheid regime
 " The South African judiciary was severely criticized by Zuma's supporters before the hearing

 The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal against this decision
 thabo mabek ne petermarittsburg ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke nirnay par apil karne ke liye sanvaidhanik nyaayalay main ek halafanama daayar kiya: It was unfair for the court to come to such far-reaching "vexatious, scandalous and unfavorable" conclusions related to me, and to judge and condemn those conclusions based on the Zuma case
 meraa sammaan purna nivedan yah he kii nyaay ke hiton kii raksha, is maamle ko sudhaare jane main he
 These adverse findings led to the withdrawal of my name by my ANC party - a request that i have accepted as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years

 a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, Talali Talali, told Pretoria by phone on 23 September, “we have received the papers
 yah vichaaradhin he
 " 12 janvari 2009 ko blomphontain ke supreme court of apil main is apil ke liye nirnay ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 Deputy Judge President Louis Harms had to decide on two aspects of the appeal
 The first aspect was whether Zuma had the right to be invited to make representations to the NPA before he decided to withdraw the bribery and corruption charges against him
 The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in understanding the political interference given by then President Thabo Mbeki in the context of the npa's decision to impose charges on Zuma
 NPA ke faisle kii samiksha ke dauraan abhyavedan aamantrit karne ke sawaal par harms deepi ne paaya ki nikholson dwaara di gai samvidhan ke 179 khand kii vyakhya galat thi kyonki NPA kaa aisa koi daayitv nahin tha or isliye ve zuma par aarope lagane ke liye swatantra tha joki usne kiya
 On the question of Nikholson's argument given by Mbeki about political interference, Harms DP found that "the lower court has violated its rights"
