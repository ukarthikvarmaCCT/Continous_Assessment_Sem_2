 As resistance to drugs develops, the effectiveness of conventional empirical treatments is decreasing, so it is necessary that antibiotics be selected based on isolated bacterial and susceptibility tests
 According to the Kokhren review on the use of antibiotics at the cap stage in antibiotic adults, the current evidence obtained by rcts is insufficient to make evidence-based decisions for antibiotic election

 Therefore, they should be used with caution as it is mostly unknown whether they are safe or not

 Earth's oceanic crust is continuously recycled by geologic processes at the boundaries of tectonic plates and has an average lifespan of around 100 million years, while Venus's surface is estimated to be 30–60 million years old
 shukr par avirat jwalamukhita ke liye anek pramaan bindu maujud he
 During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 11 and Venera 12 probes detected a continuous flow of electricity, and the Venera 12 recorded a powerful roaring thunder after its descent
 The European Space Agency's Venus Express recorded abundant electricity in the high atmosphere
 While rain on the earth brings thunderstorms, there is no rain on the surface of Venus

 Without seismic data or inertial information, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus
 shukr or prithvi ke bich aakaar or ghanatv main samanta bataati he, wein samaan aantarik sanrachana saajha karti he: ek kor, ek mental or ek crust
 Like on Earth, Venus' core is at least partially liquid because the cooling rate of these two planets has been almost the same
 shukr kaa thodaa chota aakaar bataata he, iske gahare aantarik bhaag main dabaav prithvi se kaaphi kam hai
 The major difference between these two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong for underwater abduction to make it less viscous

 Despite this, Venus may lose its internal heat intermittently in major restructuring events
 shukr kaa vayumandal atyant ghanaa he, jo mukhya rup se carbon dioxide or nitrogen kii ek choti maatra se milakar bana he
 The atmospheric mass is 93 times that of the Earth's atmosphere, while the pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of the Earth's surface pressure - this pressure is equal to the pressure of a kilometer close to the Earth's oceans

 However, after a period ranging from 60 million to several billion years, the evaporation of the original water caused a runaway greenhouse effect, which produced a significant level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere there
 However, the superficial situation on the planet is not a long guest for any earth-like life, which may have been before this event
 yah sambhaavna ki ek rahane yogya duusari jagah nichle or madhyam badal paraton main maujud he, shukr ab bhi daud se baahar nahin hua he
 Thermal inertia and heat transfer by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that Venus's surface temperature does not vary significantly between night and day sides, despite that the planet's rotation is extremely slow

 On 29 January 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet Venus flows outward, which is similar in the sense that "a comet was observed to be bombarded by a comet under similar conditions"
 " In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus' magnetic field much weaker than that of Earth
 yah chumbakeey kshetra ek aantarik dynamo, prithvi ke andruni kor kii tarah, kii bajaay inmandal or saura vaayu ke bich ek antahkriya dwaara prerit he
 The small induced magnetic field of Venus gives the atmosphere negligible protection against cosmic radiation
 yah vikiran badal dar badal bijli nirvahan kaa parinaam ho saktaa he
 Despite the Earth being equal in size, the lack of an internal magnetic field on Venus was surprising
 It was also expected that its core holds a dynamo
 ek dynamo ko teen chizon kii zarurat hoti he: ek suchalak taral, ghurnan or sanvahan
 The core is thought to be electrically conductive, while its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show that this is sufficient for a dynamo formation
 iskaa taatpary he, dynamo gum he kyonki shukr ke kor main sanvahan kii kami he
 On Earth, convection occurs in the outer layer of the core because the bottom liquid layer is much hotter than the top
 shukr par, ek vaishvik punarsatahikaran ghatana ne plate vivartaniki ko band kar diya ho saktaa he or yah bhupatal se hokar ushma pravaah ke ghataav kaa kaaran bana
 This caused the mantle temperature to rise, leading to increased heat flow outside the core
 natijatan, ek chumbakeey kshetra chalaane ke liye koi aantarik bhudinamo uplabdh nahin he
 Instead, the thermal energy released from the core is used again and again to reheat the crust
 ek sambhaavna yah ki shukr kaa koi thos bhitari kor nahin he, yaa iskaa kor vartmaan main thanda nahin he, isliye kor kaa puraa taral hissaa lagbhag ek hi taapmaana par he
 Another possibility is that its core is already completely frozen
 kor kii avasthaa gandhak ke sandran par atyadhik nirbhar he, jo philhal agyaat he
 The weak magnetic mantle around Venus means the solar wind makes direct contact with the planet's outer atmosphere
 yahaan, hydrogen va oxigen ke aayan parabangnee vikiran se nikle tatasth anuon ke viyojan dwaara banaaye gayi he
 The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to drain from the planet's magnetic field

 When Venus lies between the planet Earth and the Sun, this position is called inferior conjunction, which makes its reach closest to the Earth, the other planets being at an average distance of 4
1 crores
 shukr ausatan har 584 dinon main avar sangyojan par pahunchataa he
 Due to the decreasing eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, this minimum distance will be maximum after tens of thousands of years

 Most planets also rotate in an anti-clockwise direction on their axis, but Venus rotates counterclockwise once every 243 Earth days, which is the slowest rotation period of any planet
 is prakaar ek shukr nakshatra diwas ek shukr varsh se lambey samay tak rahata he
 The equator of Venus rotates at a speed of 6

 For an observer from the land of Venus, the sun will rise in the west and set in the east
 shukr grah, vibhinn ghurnan avadhi or jhukaav ke saath ek saura niharika se gathit hua ho saktaa he
 Due to tidal effects on dense atmospheres and disturbed rotational shifts induced by planetary ejection, it has reached its present position
 yah badlaav jo ki arabon varshon kii kriyavidhi uparaant ghatit hua hoga
 The rotation period of Venus probably represents a state of equilibrium that forms between the tidal tightness of the Sun's gravity that tends to slow rotation and an atmospheric tide created by the solar heating of the dense Venus atmosphere

 At the California Institute of Technology, 2006 studies by Alex Almy and David Stevenson on former solar systems show that Venus had at least one moon like ours that was created by a major collision event Arbo years ago
 adhyayan ke mutabik kareeb ek karod saal baad ek anya takkar ne grah kii ghurnan disha ulat di
 This caused the rotation or orbit of the Moon of Venus to slowly shrink inward until it collided with Venus and merged into it
 yadi baad kii takkaron ne chandramaa banaaye he to wein bhi usee tarah se khinch liye gaye
 An alternative explanation for the absence of satellites is the effect of powerful solar tides that can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets

 The inflection of Mercury, another inferior planet, reaches a maximum of only 28 ° and is often barely recognized in the twilight, while Venus is difficult to miss at its maximum radiance
 iske adhik se adhik adhiktam prasarkon kaa matlab he yah suryaast ke ekadam baad tak andhere aasmaan main najar aata he
 There is a simple misrepresentation of Venus as an "unknown flying table" as a bright point in the sky

 As Venus revolves around its orbit, in telescopic scenery it exhibits arts like the moon: in the arts of Venus, the planet presents a small "full" image when it is in the opposite direction to the Sun
 , When it is at the maximum angle from the Sun, exhibits a large "quartz art", and the night is at its maximum brightness in the sky, and as it moves between the Earth and the Sun
 Eepsth presents comes somewhere around the telescope a huge "skinny crescent" in the scenery
 shukr jab prithvi or surya ke bichobich hota he, apane sabase bade aakaar par hota he or apni "nav kala" prastut karata he

 In the current mode of transit, the first two transits take place at an interval of eight years, then a longer break of about 105
5 years or 121
5 years, and again at the beginning of the new transit pair of eight-year intervals

 The so-called Bhasmavarna Prakash is a mystery of long-standing Venus observations
 bhasmavarn prakaash shukr ke andhkaar paksh kii ek sukshma roshni he or najar aati he jab grah arddh chandrakaar charan main hota he
 The first claim to see this light was made long back in 1643, but the existence of the light could never be reliably confirmed

 This may be the result of the illusion of seeing a bright, crescent shaped object
 shukr grah ko "subah ke taare" or "shaam ke taare" donon hi roopon main pracheen sabhyataaon ne jaan liya tha
 Before the name itself, it is clear that they were two different things
 Ammisaduka's Venus table, dated 1581 BCE, shows the Greek understanding that the two objects were the same
 is patalika main shukr ko "akaash kii ujjwal rani" ke rup main nirdisht kiya gaya he or vistrut prekshanon ke saath is drushtikon kaa samarthan kiya ja sakaa he

 Schröter found that when the planet was a thin crescent, the bowl extended more than 180 °
 unhone sahi anumaan lagaaya ki yah ghaney vaataavaran main surya prakaash ke bikharane kii vajah se tha
 Later, when the planet was in inferior conjunction, American astronomer Chester Smith Leaman observed a full ring around its dark side and provided evidence for the atmosphere
 The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24 hours from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface
 By the 20th century, there was a lot more discovery about Venus
 isaki kareeb-kareeb akritiheen disk ne koi suraag nahin diya ki isaki sataha aakhir kis tarah kii ho sakati he
 More of its mysteries occurred with the development of exposure, spectroscopy, radar, and ultraviolet observations

 For Venus, like any other planet, the first robotic spacecraft mission began on 12 February 1961 with the launch of the Venera 1 probe
 soviet venera kaarykram antargat yah pehla yaan tha
 Venera 1 lost contact on the seventh day of the mission, when it was 20 million km from Earth

 The Soviet Venera 3 vehicle crashed while landing on Venus on 1 March 1966
 It was the first man-made object to enter the atmosphere and hit the surface of another planet
 Even though its communication system failed, before that it was able to transmit all planetary data
 On 18 October 1967, Venera 4 successfully entered the atmosphere and deployed many scientific instruments
 Venera 4 reported the surface temperature to be about 5000 c higher than that measured by Mariner 2, and showed the atmosphere to be about 90 to 95% carbon dioxide
 Venus's atmosphere was quite dense compared to the estimates made by the creators of Venera 4
 This made the parachute slower than the scheduled landing time
 This meant the battery of the vehicle slowed down before reaching the surface
 After transmitting data up to 93 minutes, 24

 Agni is the god of fire in Hinduism

 Agni is one of the highest gods since the Vedic period
 puranic yug main agni puraana naamak ek granth bhi rachit hua
 In Hindu religion, gods are worshiped by fire in yagna, havan and marriages
 samuhik yajna naamak pustak ke anusaar agni kii patni kaa naam swaha tha jo ki daksh prajapati tathaa aakuti kii putree thim

 Dakshina is an expression of money given in respect of a Guru's offering or Yajna, Shraadh and religious acts
 bharatvarsh ke gurukulon main vidhyaarthee jab padhane jate the to ve yaa to guru or uske parivaar kii seva karke athwa yadi sampann parivaar ke hue to kuch shulk dekar vidya praapt karte, kintu praaia: shulk denevaale kam hi vyakti hote the or adhikansh sevasushrusha se hi vidya praapt kar lete the
 Often, when such students finished their education and started going home, they would pay some gifts to the Guru in the form of respect and reverence which was called Dakshina
 dhire dhire gurudakshina kii reeti si ban gai or atyant garib vidhyaarthee bhi kuch na kuch dakshina avashya dene kaa ytn karne lage
 This Dakshina is not necessarily considered as due in the Vidhan, but the faithful students voluntarily give it to them, this order is done and even today, the students of ancient practice, on the day of Gurpurnima, including the money, fruits, flowers and sweet Dakshina of their teachers
 Let's worship
 dakshina ke peeche bhav tha us gurupariwaar ke bharan poshan or aarthik aavashyaktaaon kii purti kaa uttardaayitv jo vidyaadan ke liye na to koi aavashyak or nishchit fees lagaataa or na rajya athwa samaaj se uske liye koi nishshchit vetan paata
 Carrying this responsibility was considered necessary for the kings who were duty bound towards the subjects
 kalidas ne kuts kii apane guru vartantu ko dakshina dene ke sambandh kii jo katha di he usase dakshina ke peeche kii sari manyataon kaa spasht bodh ho jaataa he
 If the poor disciple could not give the Guru's Dakshina himself, he had the right to get it from the king and he could not be alienated under any circumstances
 duusari dakshina he dharmik krityon ke sambandh kii
 The Yajna is not complete without Dakshina and does not bear any fruit, after the completion of the Yajna, the Brahmin and the priest should be immediately given Dakshina and it should not be rested in any stage
 baaki lagane par vah samay ke anupaat se badhati jaati he
 Brahmaswapahari, who does not give Dakshina, is plagued by many miseries, untouchables, poor, and other miseries, her Lakshmi is gone, Pitra does not accept her body and her family, her back and forth, gets downgrades etc
 And there was a major reason behind the origin of fear
 yagyon or anya dharmik krityon ko karaanevaala jo brahmanon or purohiton kaa varg tha uske jivicoparjan kaa saadhan dhire dhire dakshinaayen hi batch raheen or ve unka shulk tathaa vritti ban gayi, jinhen koi baaki nahin laga saktaa tha
 What should they eat if they do not get Dakshina? Therefore, they not only made rules but also forced the kings and rulers through social and religious arrangements to punish those who do not pay dakshina
 yajna kii dakshina na chukaanewaale raja harishchandra ko vishwamitra ne jo pehle unke purohit rah chuke the, kis prakaar dandit kiya, yah katha puraanon main milti he 
 These Dakshinas are still a part of the religious activities, yagyas and pujas, shradhas and cultural occasions in Indian life
 dakshina swarna, rajat, sikkon, ann, vastra aadi anek roopon main di jaati he or yajmaan kii shraddha tathaa vittiya sthiti ke anusaar ghatati badhati bhi rahati he
 Despite the instinct, its value has never been fixed, it cannot be said
 dakshina ke sambandh main dharmik bhav utpann karne ke silsile main hi dakshina ko yajna purush kii stri ke rup kii devakatha kaa vikaas hua or use bhi ek devi maan liya gaya

 pracheen samaay par drushti daalane se gyaat hota he ki is pratha kaa logo ke saamaajik, aarthik jivan par vishesh prabhaav rahaa he
 In fact, this system was born on the basis of division of labor in order to increase economic compulsion and capacity in the society
 aaranbh me is vibhaajan me saralata thi or ek jati kaa vyakti duusari jati ko apana saktaa tha
 But with the passage of time, there has been suspense in this area
 jati pratha kaa prachlan keval bharat me nahi balki misr, europe aadi me bhi apekshaakrit ksheen rup me vidaymaan thi
 The word 'caste' originated from the Portuguese language

 But by spreading education, this social evil is going away

 However, the caste system is primarily an evil
 iske kaaran sankeernata kii bhaavana kaa prasar hota he or saamaajik, rashtri ekta me baadha aati he joki rashtri or aarthik pragati ke liye aavashyak he

 Fuco is counted among the foremost thinkers of the 20th century
 yah phuko ke lekhon kaa hi prabhaav tha ki aadhunik vigyaan ke bahut se kshetron main or khaskar itihaas lekhan ke kshetra main krantikari parivartan huye
 The most recent and thought-provoking development in this understanding has been done by Michel Fuco - how the state's institution makes people listen to it
 poonjipati varg rajya main apni saamaajik satta keval hinsa ke upkarnon ke dwaara hi sthapit nahin karata
 He also ensures continuity of his social power by using a variety of cultural forms
 isliye rajya kii sanrachanaon ko unke saanskrithik roopon main samajhnaa bhi aavashyak he
 Ultimately, these cultural structures bear the responsibility of creating consensus in favor of the state
 phuko bataate hai ki aadhunik samaaj main logon ko niyantrit yaa anushaasit karne ke liye nigaraanee kii ek bahustareey vyavastha ke alaava dusron dwaara kiye gayi nirnyon ko aatmsaat karne tathaa pariksha pranali jaise upaay apanaaye jate hai
 Fuko insists that just keeping an eye on the people completes half the power
 iske liye ve stadium kii vyavastha kaa hawala dete hai jisamen siton kii vyavastha is tarah kii jaati he ki darshak kisi kaarykram ko aasaani se dekh paayen par saath hi yah vyavastha satta ke niyantrakon ko darshakon par nigaah rakhane kii sahuuliyat bhi pradaan karti he
 Fuco also mentions the prison punopticon conceived by political thinker Jeremy Bentham to mark the model of power of discipline and control
 jisaki mul vaastu-yojana kuch aisi thi ki kothriyon main band kaidi ek duusare ke liye to adrishy rahen lekin jail ke kendriya tower kii nigaraanee se baahar na ho paayen
 Prisoners never get to know whether they are being monitored or not, but there is a thought in their minds that someone keeps an eye on them
 phuko panoptican ke siddhant ko ek aise roopak kii tarah dekhte hai jo jail kii chauhaddi ke paar jaakar skulon, kaarkaanon or aspataalon main anushaasan kaa aam dharra ban jaataa he
 Although this proposed prison of Bantham was never able to materialize, but as a theory, it has occupied almost every activity of modern society
 aadhunik samaaj main anushaasan kaayam karne vaali vyavasthaaon ke liye vah ek aisa aujaar siddh hui he jisane praaq-aadhunik kaal ke raajaaon or hakimon ko apdasth kar unki jagah khud ko sthapit kar liya he
 In this sequence, Fuko also shows that the system governing modern power or discipline does not only monitor the activities of the people but also controls the people by showing their incompetence
 unke anusaar aadhunik satta samaj, pratibha, saamaanya or asaamaanya vyavhaar jaisi kotiyon kaa nirmaan karti he or jab koi vyakti iske dwaara sthapit kasautiyon yaa maanakon par karaa nahin utarataa to vyavastha aise vyakti ko kamatar yaa asaamaanya ghoshit karne kaa mauka nahin chookti
 In this context, Fuku does not forget to remind that this attitude of these disciplinary institutions of modern society is not driven by any kind of vengeance but by reform
 jiskaa antim lakshya yah hota he ki vyakti samaaj kii pradutt kasautiyon yaa maanakon ko sweekaar kar le
 Note that this method of discipline by the beliefs of the society is quite different from that system of judicial punishment in which a person was punished only on the basis of whether his act is lawful or not
 aise kisi faisale main yah nahin kaha jaataa tha ki vyakti saamaanya he yaa asaamaanya
 But modern society insists on setting certain standards in the matters of educational programs, medical practices and industry and products, and the dominance of these standards is so all-round that the behavior and personality of the individual starts to change accordingly
 saamanytah rajya ko shashan, sanghathan yaa raajnneetik samudaay ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 It is believed that its various forms have existed in every phase of history
 isamen hone vaale badlaav itihaas ke pramukh vishay rahe hai
 Only primitive nomadic political communities are not given the status of the state
 mana jaataa he ki in samudaayon main is avadharana ke saath- saath usase judi sunishchit vyavastha kaa abhaav hota he
 In fact, to be a state, it is necessary that there is a permanent relationship between the community and the territory
 is saamaanya tareeke se upyog kiye jane par yah shabd is vichaar ko abhivyakt karata he ki raajnneetik samudaay kii kuch aisi nishchit saarvbhaumik visheshtaayen hoti hai, jo samay or sthaan se pare hoti hai; arthath greek polis, madhyayugin regnum or aadhunik ganatantron ke bich kuch saamaanya visheshta hai
 Can this property or feature be defined more narrowly? yah baat to spasht he ki yadi rajya kii koi paribhaasha ise shaashvat or aparivartansheel vastu yaa sanghathan ke rup main pesh karti he, to aisa karke vah itihaas main badlaav or vikaas kii prakriya kii upeksha karti he
 Therefore a valid definition should focus on other aspects and functions
 itihaas yah dikhaata he ki ek saarvbhaumik parighatna ke rup main rajya ek aisi gatividhi yaa sanghathan he, jo manushya par aavashyaktaaon ke rup main thopi gayi he
 Some of its main features as an activity of this kind are as follows: It creates a definite connection between humans and their possessions; Or in other words it creates unity or society among humans
 isliye rajya kaa astitv vishisht taur par ek buniyadi chiz he
 Second, it accepts the connection between humans with the power of order, or a form of rule or command and obedience
 teesraa, rajya ko banane or kaayam rakhane vaali gatividhi vishisht hoti he, jo hameshaa khud ko un logon ke kilaaf pesh karti he, jo is samudaay kaa bhaag nahin hote hai
 However, despite seeing the state as a historical phenomenon, it cannot be denied that a philosophical aspect has always been involved in the writing on it
 iske tahat prashn uthta he ki rajya jis tarah kii vyavastha yaa logon ke bich sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta he, uskaa adarsh rup kya he? kya vah adarsh rup hasil kar liya gaya he? kya shashan kaa vartmaan tarika sahi he? kya samudaay ke bahari sambandhon ko sahi tareeke se sanchalit kiya ja rahaa he? asal main, is najariye se vichaar karne par rajya sirf manushyon par thopi gayi aavashyaktaa ke rup main hi saamne nahin aata he, balki yah manushyon ke saamne ‘sahi’ ke chunaav kii samasya ke rup main bhi saamne aata he
 There is no struggle to establish a system instead of just anarchy in the state
 isaki bajaay, yah ek aisi vyavastha sthapit karne kaa bhi sangharsh he, jo sachhee, pramanik or nyaaypurna ho
 Therefore, the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Hegel etc
 can be seen as an attempt to find a philosophical answer to the question of what the kingdom should be like
 in vidwaanon ne rajya or duusare tarah ke maanav- sanghathanon ke bich antar karne kii koshish kii he or iske saath hi inhone apane adarsh rajya kii pariklpana or uske paksh main tark bhi prastut kiye hai
 There is also a need to connect the idea of the state as a universal historical phenomenon and the idea of the state as a philosophical concept, especially the modern phenomenon
 aise bahut se itihaaskaar or raajnneetik sidghantkaar hai, jo yah tark dete hai ki ‘rajya’ shabd kaa upyog europe main punarjagran or dharm-sudhaar ke baad saamne aayi vyavastha ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 They believe that the principle of the state is in fact linked to this specific phenomenon
 isliye yadi iskaa prayog itihaas ke duusare daur main maujuud sanghathanon ke liye kiya jaataa he, to isse iske arth ke bare main bhram badhegaa
 The term state as an organized system also arose between the end of the fourteenth century and the seventeenth century
 rajya kaa angrezi shabd ‘state’ latin shabd ‘stair’ se niklaa he, jiskaa arth he khadaa hona
 In this way it tells about a situation
 rajya ko ek aadhunik avadharana maanane ke peeche ek mukhya vichaar yah bhi he ki aadhunik rajya kaa ubhaar prabhusatta kii avadharana ke saath hua
 It is a clear modern belief that a state which is not sovereign, is not a state in the true sense
 prabhusatta kaa arth yah he ki rajya apane adhikaar main aane vaale bhu-kshetra main raajnneetik praadhikaar kaa sarvocch strot he
 Sovereignty has two aspects - the internal aspect and the external aspect
 aantarik pahalu kaa arth he ki rajya kii simaaon ke bheetar rajya se unchaa koi bhi praadhikari nahin he
 The state is supreme and the citizen cannot appeal against any other authority against the state
 bahari prabhusatta kaa arth he— kisi vishisht rajya ko duusare rajyon dwaara di jane vaali manyata
 Also, it also accepts that a state can speak on behalf of its citizens in international affairs
 yah adhikaar antarrashtriya daayre main rajya kii swaittata or prabhusatta ko vyakt karata he
 To consider the state as a modern phenomenon does not mean that it should also be dismissed as a historical entity or a philosophical idea
 yah bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik rajya kii koi bhi visheshta itihaas ke pehle ke daur main maujuud nahin thi
 In fact, many of the characteristics of the earlier 'states' of the modern era and the 'states' encountered with the modern era are similar
 isi tarah, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki ek darshanik vichaar ke rup main rajya aadhunik rajya kii ‘purna avadharana’ kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 In fact, philosophically, the concept of the state has been conceived and discussed in different ways
 masalan, udaarataavaadiyon ne rajyon ko ek ‘tatasth’ sanstha ke rup main dekha, lekin rajya kii bhoomika ke bare main udaarataavaad ke bheetar gambheer or vividh charchaa hoti rahi he
 Even within Marxism, there is a rich tradition of debate over the state
 isamen rajya ko poonjipati virgon kaa saadhan maanane ke saath hi ‘rajya kii saapekshik swaittata’ se judaa vaad-vivaad bhi shaamil rahaa he
 Anarchists have considered the state as an unnatural power and advocated its complete abolition
 marks-angels ke lekhan main bhi ek aisi samyavaadee sthiti kii kalpana kii gayi he, jisamen rajya puri tarah khatm ho jaayegaa
 But instead of waiting for such a situation, anarchists want to end the state as soon as possible
 inkaa maananaa he ki rajya manushya kii swaabhaavik prakruti ke kilaaf hinsa par aadhaarit he
 On the other hand, conservatives favor the state so that it can preserve the traditions and values accumulated over many generations
 nariwadiyon ke bheetar kii vibhinn dhaaraon main rajya ke bare main alag-alag tarah se vichaar kiya gaya he
 For example, liberal-feminism holds that the state as an institution is inclined towards male supremacy, but this trend of the state can be improved by making laws and using it to establish male-female equality
 can be done
 duusari ore, samaajawaadee-nariwad rajya ke poonjeewaadi charitra ko mahilaon kii samasya kaa mukhya kaaran maanata he
 It is believed that only the end of capitalist state can improve the condition of women
 teesraa, radical nariwadi vichaar ke mutabik rajya pitrusatta par aadhaarit parivaar or uske dwaara aage badhaaye jane vaale mulyon kii hifaazat kaa kaam karata he
 Therefore, to completely eliminate patriarchy, it is necessary to abolish the state
 spasht taur par, rajya, isaki prakruti or bhoomika ke bare main bahut vividh or gahan vaad-vivaad he
 In recent times, it has been argued that the state is slowly becoming irrelevant due to the emergence of structures like the European Union
 lekin yah tark bahut majboot nahin he
 It is true that the countries involved in the European Union have given their consent to form a strong regional organization
 phir bhi, ve ek raashtra-rajya ke rup main apni-apni pahchaan khatm nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Many other regional organizations have also increased cooperation between the countries of the region, but there is no possibility that they will prove to be an alternative to the nation-state
 samakaleen duniya main rajya ek aisi hakeekat he, jiske khatm hone kaa koi asaar nahin he
 Followers of many ideologies opposing it ideologically have failed to finish the institution of the state even if given a practical opportunity

 ek din raja shikaar karne nikle or bhatak gaye
 He felt thirsty and then asked his soldiers to get water from anywhere
 jab kaaphi der tak sainik nahin laute to vah khud dhundne nikal pade
 At last they saw a pond, but saw their soldiers lying unconscious there
 lekin pyaas se baichaiyn raja pani pine kii koshish karne lage or tabhi ek aurat kii aawaaj ai
 He asked to stop and said that this pond is mine, no one can drink water from here without my consent
 tumhaare sainikon ne yahi galati kii, parinaam dekh lo
 Raj became convinced of the beauty of the woman
 unhone apana parichay diya or bataaya ki ye mere sainik hai
 Who are you? And how is my son's condition? The woman told that i am Kalinga, the sister of the Panchdev gods
 aap yadi raja hai to un ladate hue do bhainson ko alag kar dikhaao tab main maanuungi ki aap raja hai
 The king did not understand how to deliver them
 aakhirkaar kalinga ne unhen alag kar diya
 Raj was shocked and so impressed that he made up his mind to marry her
 panchdevon ne mil kar raja se kalinga kii shaadi kar diya
 When the rest of the queens saw her, all started to hate
 phir ek din vah garbhvatee huin
 It was difficult for the seven to bear it and planned to end her pregnancy
 kalinga ko daraaya ki ek jyotishi ne kaha he ki tumhen apane bachche ko paidaa hote hi dekhnaa acha nahin he
 Therefore, during delivery, the saus tied a black bandage on her eyes
 jab kalinga kaa baccha hua tab use gaayon ke gaushale main phenk diya, taaki gaayon ke pairon tale dab jaae or kalinga ko bataaya gaya ki usne pathar ko janm diya
 On the other hand, in Goshale, the child did not even touch and the cows kept the child alive by feeding him milk
 phir bichchhu se bhare ghaas ke khet main daal diya gaya, namak ke dher main dabaaya gaya, lekin yah chini ke dher main badal gaya
 Finally, putting the child in the iron box, he was dragged into the river Kali
 saat din tathaa saat raat ke baad vah sanduk gauri ghat par panhucha
 Where he got caught in a fisherman's net named Bhana
 usne or uski patni ne bachche ko dekha tab uske aakhon main khushi kii chamak dikhi, kyonki unhen bhi koi baccha nahin tha
 Gradually, amazing powers began to develop inside the child
 ek din bachche ne sapane main dekha ki uski maa kalinga rote-bilakhte kah rahi he ki tu meraa putr he
 Aaja with me son and with it all the events of birth were seen through a dream
 ek din us balak ne apane pita se kaha ki mujhe ek ghoda chahie
 Where could a poor fisherman buy a horse, so he made a carrot horse and gave it to the child
 bachche ne apane chamatkaarik shakti se us ghode main praan daal die
 One day he reached Dhumakot, the capital of King Jhalurai, near a pond and tied his horse to rest
 usee jalashay ke paas hi saaton raniyaan baat kar rahi thim ki kis tarah rani kalinga ke saath shadyantra kar uske bachche ko maarane kii koshish kii thi unhone or kalinga ko khun se lipta silbetta dikhaakar use dhokhaa diya tha
 After some time he took his horse to the reservoir and asked the queens to move away and started saying that my horse needs to drink water
 ve uski bate sun kar hansane lageen or kehane lageen ki tu bevakoof he
 Can a horse of wood also drink good water? In response, the child said that if a woman can give birth to Silbatta, then why a horse of wood cannot drink water? All the queens were surprised to hear this and went to the king and started complaining about that child
 sainikon se us bachche ko pakadvaaya gaya auki raja ke saamne laayaa gaya
 The king asked what is this stupid
 kaath kaa ghoda pani kaise pi saktaa he? balak ne jawaab diya- maharaj jis raja ke rajya main stri silbatte ko janm de sakati he to yah kaath kaa ghoda bhi pani pi saktaa he
 The child then narrated the events of his birth to the king and said that there has been a great injustice to my mother Kalinga and you have also been cheated
 gusse se aag babule hue raja ne saaton raniyon ko bandigrih main daal diya
 Then seven of the queens repented and started apologizing to Kalinga
 tab us balak ne apane pita ko samajha-bujhaakar unhen maaf kar dene kaa anurodh kiya
 Finally the king left them to live a life similar to that of the maidens
 yahi balak bada hokar gwel, golju, bala goriya gaur bhairav golu ityadi naamon se prasiddh hua

 web trephic, ek website ke liye aagantukon dwaara bheje gaye or praapt kiye gaye data kii raashi he
 It is a major part of Internet traffic
 ise aagantukon kii sankhya or unke dwaara khole gaye prishthon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 Sites monitor incoming and outgoing traffic to find out which pages on their site are popular or whether there is a clear trend, such as a particular page being viewed in a particular country
 is trephic par nazar rakhane ke kai zariye hai or ekatrit data kaa istemaal sait ko sanrachit karne, suraksha samasyaon ko ujagar karne yaa bandwidth kii sambhavit kami ko ingit karne main kiya jaataa he - sabhi web trephic swaagat yogya nahin hote
 In lieu of increased web traffic, some companies offer advertising schemes that pay for space on the site's screen

 Notable vendors of web analytics software and services include: webtrends, Coremetrics, Omnitures and Google Analytics
 web citon or vyaktigat prishthon yaa sait ke bheetar kisi hisse kii lokapriyata ko jaanane ke liye web trephic kaa maapan kiya jaataa he
 Web traffic can be analyzed by looking at the traffic statistics found in the web server log file, which is an automatically generated list of all pages used
 jab koi fil pesh kii jaati he to ek hit utpann hota he
 The page itself is considered a file, but images are also files, thus a page with 5 images can generate 6 hits
 ek pej vyuu tab utpann hota he jab ek aagatuk web site ke bheetar kisi bhi prishth kaa anurodh karata he - ek aagatuk hameshaa kam se kam ek pej vyuu ko utpann karegaa or kai adhik bhi kar saktaa he
 Monitoring applications outside the website can record traffic by inserting a small piece of HTML code into each page of the website
 web trephic ko kabhi kabhi packet snifing dwaara mapa jaataa he or is prakaar trephic aankade ke yadrichhik namoonay praapt kiye jate hai jinase phir sampoorn internet prayog main web trephic ke bare main jaankaree nikaali jaati he
 The following types of information are considered when monitoring web traffic: alexa internet jaisi web citen, trephic ranking or aankade pesh karti he jo un logon par aadhaarit hote hai jo alexa tulbaar kaa upyog karte hue citon kaa prayog karte hai
 The difficulty with this is that it does not take a complete picture of traffic for a site
 badi citen aamtaur par nilsan netretings jaisi anya companiyon kii sevaayen leti hai, lekin unki report keval sadsyta se hi uplabdh hoti hai
 The amount of traffic experienced by a web site is a measure of its popularity
 aagantukon ke aankade kaa vishleshan karke, site kii kamiyon ko dekhnaa or un kshetron main sudhaar karnaa sambhav he
 It is also possible to increase the popularity of a site and the number of people using it
 password dwaara site ke kuch bhaagon kii raksha karnaa kabhi-kabhi mahatvapurn hota he, jisase keval adhikrut log hi vishesh anubhaagon yaa prishthon kaa istemaal kar pate hai
 Some site administrators have chosen to restrict their page to certain traffic, such as by geographic location
 america raashtrapati jorge dablue
 bush ke punarchunaav kii abhiyaan site ko site par ek hamale kii khabar ke baad 25 oktober 2004 ko america se baahar ke sabhi internet upyogkartaaon ke liye avaruddh kar diya gaya
 It is also possible to limit access to the web server, depending on the number of connections and the bandwidth transmitted by each connection
 On the Apache HTTP Server, this is accomplished by the Limitipcon module and others
 khoj ingine main kisi sait ko rakhkar or vigyaapan kii kharid dwaara web trephic ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he, jisamen thok email, pop ap aids or antar-prishth vigyaapan shaamil he
 Web traffic can also be increased by purchasing non-internet based advertising
 yadi ek web pej kisi khoj ke pratham prishth main soochibaddh nahin he, to kisi vyakti dwaara ise khoje jane kii sambhaavna kaaphi kam ho jaati he 
 Very few people go after the first page and the percentage of people who go to the front pages is quite low
 falswaroop, khoj ingine par uchit sthaan hasil karnaa utana hi mahatvapurn he jitna khud web site
 Web traffic that comes from non-paid listings in search engines or directories is commonly referred to as "organic" traffic
 organic trephic ko utpann karne yaa badhaane ke liye web sait ko directory, khoj ingine, guide or puraskaar citon main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 In most cases the best way to increase web traffic is to register it with the major search engines
 Just registering does not guarantee traffic, as search engines work by "crawling" registered web sites
 in croling prograamon ko "spidar" yaa "robot" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 The crawler starts on the registered home page and usually follows the hyperlinks it finds, in order to access the pages within the web site
 krolar un prishthon ke bare main jaankaree ekatra karne lagata he or use khoj ingine ke database main unka sangrahan or anukraman karata he
 In each case, they index the page URL and page title
 adhikansh maamalon main ve web pej header or prishth kii ek nishchit maatra ko krambaddh karte hai
 Subsequently, when a search engine user searches for a particular word or phrase, the search engine searches the database and produces results, which are usually sorted by relevance according to the search engine algorithm
 aamtaur par, sheersh organic parinaam, web upyogkartaaon kii adhikansh clic hasil karte hai
 According to some studies, the top result gets a click between 5% and 10%
 baad ke prayek parinaam ko pichley parinaam kii tulana main 30% or 60% ke bich clic hasil hota he
 This shows that it is important to appear in the top results
 kuch companiyon hai jo khoj ingine vipanan main visheshgy hai
 However, it is becoming common for webmasters to be approached by "boiler-room" companies without any real knowledge of how the results are achieved
 pe-par-clic ke vipareet, khoj ingine vipanan kaa aamtaur par masik yaa vaarshik bhugtan kiya jaataa he or adhikansh khoj ingine companiyaan vishisht parinaamon kaa vaada nahin kar sakati jiske liye unhen bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 Because of the immense amount of information available on the web, the crawler may take several days, weeks, or months to complete the review and indexing of all pages searched
 udhaaharan ke liye, google ne yatha 2004, aath bilian prishthon ko anukramit kiya tha
 Even with hundreds or thousands of servers working on spidering of pages, a complete re-indexing takes time
 yahi kaaran he ki kuch web citon main haal hi main adhyatan prishth, khoj ingine par khoj karte samay turant nahin milte hai
 Excessive web traffic can also dramatically slow down or prevent access to a web site
 yah is vajah se hota he kyonki sarwar jitne anurodh sambhaal saktaa he usase kahin adhik fil anurodh use milte hai or ho saktaa he jaanboojhkar koi hamalaa ho yaa bas adhik lokapriyata kii vajah se ho saktaa he
 Large-scale web sites with multiple servers can often withstand the required traffic, and it is more likely that smaller services are affected by traffic overload
 dinayal of sarvice hamale ne ek durbhaavnapurna hamale ke baad web citon ko band hone ke liye vivash kiya, jiske tahat in web citon ko itane anurodhon se bhar diya jitna ve sambhaal nahin sakate the
 Viruses were also used to support large-scale denial of service attacks
 prachaar main aakasmik visphot ke kaaran web trephic adhibhaar utpann ho saktaa he
 Any news in the media, a fast-paced email or a link to a popular site can be the reason for such visitor flooding
