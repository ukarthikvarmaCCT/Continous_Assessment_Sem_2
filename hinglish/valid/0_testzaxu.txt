 naagarikta kii avadharana pehle kanoonon se utpann hui
 The first type of citizenship was based on how people lived in the small-scale organic communities of the polis, in ancient Greek times
 un dinon main naagarikta ko ek saarvajanik maamle ke rup main nahin dekha jaataa tha, yah ek vyakti ke nijee jivan se alag hoti thi
 The obligations of citizenship were intimately connected with the daily life of the polis
 sahi myne main manushya hone ke liye, vyakti ko samudaay kaa ek sakriy naagarik bananaa padataa tha, jise arastu ne is tarah se abhivyakt kiya tha: "samudaay ke maamalon ke sanchaalan main hissaa na lene kaa arth he ki yaa to aap jaanavar hai yaa devtaa!" naagarikta kaa yah rup samudaay ke prati nagarikon ke dayitvon par aadhaarit tha, iske bajaay samudaay main nagarikon ko die jane vaale adhikaar adhik myne nahin rakhte the
 This was not a problem because all those people were strongly associated with the polis; Their own fate and the fate of the community were strongly related to each other
 iske alaava, polis ke naagarik dayitvon ko dharmik hone kaa avasar maanate the, yah unke liye sammaan or aadar kaa ek strot hota tha
 In Athens, there were both ruler and governed citizens, important political and judicial offices were rotated, and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in a political assembly
 haalanki, polis kii naagarikta kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu vishistataa thi
 Citizenship in ancient Greece and Rome and medieval cities, which followed the citizenship of the polis, were exclusive and the status of inequality was widely accepted

 is naam se naina devi ke kai mandir hai:- The internal combustion engine is an engine in which fuel and oxidizer are ignited in a cylindrical combustion chamber closed on all sides
 dahan kii is kriya main praayah hawa hi oxykaarak kaa kaam karti he
 The closed chamber in which combustion takes place is called combustion chamber
 dahan kii yah abhikriya ooshmakshepi hoti he jo ucch taap evam daab vaali gaisen utpann karti he
 These gases circulate by pushing a piston in the combustion chamber
 piston ek connecting rod ke madhyam se ek krank shaft se judaa hota he, is prakaar jab piston neeche kii taraf jaataa he to connecting rod se judi krank shaft ghumne lagati he, is prakaar eendhan kii rasinic urja pehle ooshmiya urja main badalati he or phir ooshmiya urja yantric urja main badal jaati he
 Unlike the internal combustion engine, the working fluid in the exhaust engine is obtained by heating a liquid in another chamber
 praayah pistonyukt pratyaagaamee ingine, jisamen kuch-kuch samyaanterval ke baad dahan hota he, ko hi anterdahan ingine kaha jaataa he kintu jet ingine, adhikansh rocket evam anek gas terbine bhi anterdahan ingine kii shrenee main aati hai jinamein dahan kii kriya anwarat rup se chalati rahati he
 Nowadays most of the engines used in automobiles are internal engines
 antardahan ingine ke avishkaar kaa vichaar madhyayug se prarambh hua
 In 1680, the Dutch scientist Christian Hyges suggested a vertical cylinder and piston engine, in which a piston shot upwards by a gunpowder explosion
 kintu is tarah kaa ingine kabhi kaam main nahin aayaa
 Later, with the invention of combustible gases and mineral oils, his suggestion became practical as the problem of giving fuel instead of gunpowder was solved
 lekin phir bhi is varg ke injanon ko vyaavhaarik upyogita ke anukool banane main anek varsho ke praayegic or saidhantik adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Diesel, petrol, alcohol or natural or synthetic gas etc
 are used as fuel in internal combustion engines
 lekin saadhaarant: petrol or dijal kaa hi upyog hota he
 Impedance engines operate on two principles - quadrant cycle and quadratic cycle four stroke ingine main chaaron stroke sakson,compresson,power va agzast kii prakiya purna hoti he
 And power when the piston is up and down twice
 matlab krenkashaft do baar gumti he
 Fuel is saved in the four stroke engine
 antardahan injanon main do jatiyaan hoti hai, ekadish sakriy ingine or ubhaydish sakriy ingine
 In active engines, the working material rests on only one side of the piston; On both sides in amphibious active engines
 unamem silinder lanbaa rahata he or piston ke donon ke bhaagon main chushan, sampeden ityadi hota rahata he
 Most internal engines are activated directly
 udhaahrant:, motorkaron main ingine isi prakaar ke hote hai
 But many large engines are enabled amphibiously
 ekadish sakriy ingine kii apeksha ubhaydish sakriy ingine main lagbhag duguni urja utpann hoti he or naap main nammaatr hi vruddhi hoti parantu ubhaydish sakriy injanon ke nirmaan main kai yantric kathinaaiyaan padati hai
 Therefore, only large boat engines have amphibious active engines
 duusari ore, vaashp ingine or vaayu sampidak saadhaarant: ubhaydish sakriy banaae jate hai, yadhyapi yah anivaary niyam nahin he
 Most of today's combustion engines are built on the principle of Otto cycle
 gananaa kii saralata ke liye ham kalpana kar sakate hai ki chakra main do kriyaayein samentropic or do sthiraayatnik hoti hai
 In order to facilitate the analysis of hypothetical cycles, it is assumed that the working substance is air only
 yah bhi maan liya jaataa he ki na to chushan aghat hota he ore na nikaas aghat
 This analysis is called aerodynamic analysis
 vaastavik ingine main gaison kaa nikaas hota he
 Instead, gases are thought to cool at a constant volume
 kaary utana hi hota he, chaahe gaison kaa nikaas kiya jaae, chaahe unhen thanda kiya jaae prayek dasha main idhan ke jalane se utpann ushma utani hi rahati he
 The rate at which energy is converted into work is called power; This is the amount of work in a unit of time
 vah kaary jo aage peeche chalanevaale piston yukt ingine ke piston par kiya jaataa he, nirdisht karm kehalaata he or nirdisht kaary ke anusaar gananaa kii hui shakti nirdisht ashwashakti kehalaati he
 The amount of work that reaches the engine axis is called axle work or brake work and the power generated according to this work is called brake horsepower
 kisi antardahan ingine ke kitna shakti praapt ho sakati he, ise nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai aadhaar liye ja sakate hai
 Motorcar engine makers in their advertisements state the maximum power of their engine, which is achieved when all conditions are optimally suited
 parantu audyogic ingine kaa nirmaataa apane injanon kii shakti saadhaarant: lagbhag mahattam ushmiya dakshata par utpann honevaali shakti ke anusaar nirdhaarit karte hai
 It is also best to determine the power of industrial engines in this way
 kaaran yah he ki yadi ingine nirdhaarit samarthy par chalaae jaayenge to eendhan kaa kharch nunatam hoga or phir aavashyaktaa hone par kuch samay tak ve adhik samarthy par bhi kaam kar sakenge
 The power received in each internal combustion engine depends on the mass of the fuel-air mixture that enters the cylinder in one run of the piston
 isliye jin kaarnon se yah dravyaman ghatega unase ingine kaa samarthy ghatega
 In the actual engine, there is some impediment to the mixing of the fuel-air-mixing reducing device called resistor, and the intake and exhaust valves
 isliye mishran ko chuusate samay silinder main daab vayumandaleey daab se kam hi rah jaati he
 As a result, the mixture does not penetrate as much as is considered in theoretical calculations
 saidhantik gananaa main to maan liya jaataa he ki silinder ke bheetar mishran kii daab vayumandaleey daab ke baraabar he
 Then, the inner surface of the cylinder, and the mixtures remain relatively hot
 isliye silinder main pahunchne par idhan mishran garam ho jaataa he
 According to the volume heat-pressure law, the mass of the mixture in the cylinder is less than the mass that would have been when it was cold due to the increase in temperature
 phir, vaastavik ingine main silinder ke chhot sthaan main, nikaas ghaat ke purna ho jane par bhi, gaisen aadi vayumandaleey daab se adhik daab par rah jaati hai or chushan ghaat ke aarambh main ve silinder main fail jaati hai
 Suction begins only after their pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure
 isse bhi siddhanthata pariklit maatra se kam hi mishran silinder main pravesh karata he
 Finally, the higher the engine is above sea level, the lower the atmospheric pressure
 isliye dravyaman ke anusaar jitna mishran silinder main samudratal par pravisht ho sakegaa usase kam hi mishran unche sthalon main pravisht ho paaegaa
 The rectangular efficiency of the combustion engine not only decreases with increasing height, it also decreases with increasing engine speed
 isliye daud pratiyogita main prayukt injanon or adhik oonchaai par kaam karanevaale injanon main bahudhaa supercharger laga diya jaataa he
 There is a small centrifugal fan in this device which pushes the fuel-air mixture at a higher pressure of atmospheric pressure in the cylinder
 supercharger lagane se aaytneey dakshata bad jaati he, yahan tak ki yah 1 se adhik bhi ho ja sakati he
 In the analysis of the Otto cycle it has been shown that increasing the compression ratio increases efficiency
 vaastavik injanon main bhi yahi pravriti dikhaai padati he
 In engines operating according to the Otto cycle, the suction shock also carries air as well as fuel, and therefore remains present in compression shock as well
 jab sampeden anupaat bahut bada rakhaa jaataa he to sampeden ke ek niyat maatra se adhik hote hi idhan mishran main adhisphot hota he, arthath idhan swayan, bina spark plag se chinagaari aae, jal uthta he
 Then, even if this does not happen, compression waves arise when the spark plugs start to burn, sparking ahead of the burning mixture near the spark
 in sampeden laharon ke kaaran chinagaari se dur kaa mishran swayan jal uth saktaa he, jo avaanchhneeya he
 Then, the fuel mixture may burn prematurely by burning the charred residue of petrol etc

 There have been many new discoveries in the last few decades, which can keep the compression ratio much larger without being overcorrected
 udhaahrant: Motorcar engines had a compression ratio of about 4

 The speed of the engines is usually stated in revolutions per minute, but it is not determined how many revolutions per minute the engine is placed in which particular class
 iske atirikt teevrgati vaashp ingine main jitne chakkar prati minute hote hai, ve atyant mandgati antardahan ingine ke chakkar prati minute 4,000 yaa kuch adhik chakkar kaa veg rahata he, parantu daud kii pratiyogita ke liye bane injanon main chakkar prati minute 6,000 ke aasapaas hote hai
 Diesel engines, which have about 1,000 revolutions per minute, are called rapid diesel

 The velocity of the piston also determines the range of motion of the engines, because greatly increasing the velocity of the piston destroys the engine quickly
 motorcar ke injanon main piston-veg ab 2,800 foot prati minute yaa isse bhi kuch adhik rakhaa jaataa he
 The average velocity of a piston in diesel engines is between 1,000 and 1,200 feet per minute
 injanon kii naap silinder ke vyas or piston kii daud se bataai jaati he
 For example, a 12-18 inch engine means that the cylinder has a diameter of 12 inches and the piston races 18 inches

 After doing missionary work here, he moved in 1545 AD to propagate Christianity in the Malaya Peninsula

 Childbirth means giving birth or giving birth to a child
 garbhavastha ke nirdhaarit kaal puraa hone par bachche kaa janm bina kisi avrodh ke hi hona saadhaaran or saral janm kehalaata he
 After observing the child's birth carefully, it is realized that we can divide the method of childbirth into three parts
 pratham bhaag main bachchedani kaa munh khulanaa or failana, duusare bhaag main bachche main sir kaa dikhaai padana or teesraa bhaag jisamen auval baahar aata he
 First part The first phase of childbirth is about 10 to 12 hours or more
 pratham charan kaa samay is baat par nirbhar karata he ki mahila kaa koun sa baccha he
 This phase takes longer in the first child
 duusare bachche main kam tathaa tisare bachche main or kam samay lagata he
 In the first stage, the walls of the vagina are thinned, spread, stretched, and gently moved by the baby's head
 yoni kaa failaa or khinchaa hua bhaag dhire-dhire bachchedani ke munh ko aage aane main madad karata he
 With this phase, a greasy material also comes out which is similar to a membrane called show
 kabhi-kabhi sukuchan je saath-saath emniotic sac fat jaataa he tathaa emniotic drav nikalne lagata he
 Second part: In the second stage of childbirth, the pressure of the uterus occurs after every two minutes and lasts for half or one minute
 is dabaav ke kaaran baccha dhire-dhire neeche dhakela jaataa he
 The child's head can be seen at this stage
 iske baad yoni dhire-dhire simatate hue paraton ke rup main ek parat duusare ke upar chadhati rahati he
 Generally, the head of the child is upwards and his torso is downwards
 kabhi-kabhi dard ke saath bachche ko nikaalane ke liye pet se bhi bachche ko halke haathon se dabaaya jaataa he
 In this stage, long breath exercise is beneficial for the woman
 kyonki saans ko rokkar hi mahila kaa jor lagaana padataa he
 Sometimes tools are also used to get children out
 bachche kaa janm hote samay jab baccha baahar aata he maa ko aisa mahasoos hota he ki jaise ki unke sharir se mel baahar aa rahaa ho
 At the time of delivery, the baby's head comes out first
 phir ek kandhaa, doosraa kandhaa tathaa baad main puraa dhad baahar nikal aata he is prakaar ke bachche ke janm lete hi doosraa charan puraa ho jaataa he
 After the child is born, the baby's mouth and nose are first cleaned
 Sometimes a machine is used to clean the smooth substance and other liquids from the baby's mouth and respiratory tract
 iske baad bachche ko acchhee tarah se saaf kapade main lapet lete hai jisase bachche ke sharir kaa taapmaana bana rahe
 Cleaning of baby's eyes after birth is also necessary
 bachche ke janm lene ke baad bachche ke saans lene kii kaaryakshmata, dil kii dhadkan, twachaa kaa rang, haath pairon kaa hilanaa va chune par bachche kaa swabhaav dekha jaataa he
 This is called apgar
 yadi bachche kii kaaryakshmata saamaanya hoti he to bachche ke haath-pair, kaan, mel-mutradwar tathaa bachche kii peeth ko dekhne ke baad bachche ke pet kii safai aadi kii jaati he tathaa bhojan kii nalika ke avrodh ko dekha jaataa he
 The third stage of the birth of a child is the third stage of the arrival of the Oval after the birth of the child
 bachche ke janm hone ke baad baccha ek naad se judaa hota he jisko naad kehete hai
 It is white, beige and rope-like in shape
 iske bachche kii dhadkan mahasoos kii ja sakati he
 It carries enough amount of blood and oxygen to the child
 duusari taraf yah naad ovel se judaa rahata he jo maa ke bachchedani kii diwaar se chipka rahata he jab baccha thik taraf se rone lagata he or uskaa rang gulabi rang kaa ho jaae to iskaa arth yah hota he ki bachche kaa dil or fefde kaary karne lage hai isi avasthaa main naad ko bachche kii naabhi se lagbhag 8 se 10 semi kii duuri par clamp lagaakar kaata jaataa he
 Cut the pulse and see that it does not touch the ground or anything else because it catches the disease soon and it can cause disease to the child
 isiilie ise kaatane ke baad bachche ke pet par daal dena hi uchit hota he bachche kii kati naad par koi dawa bhi lagaai ja sakati he
 The severed pulse of the child dries slowly within 24 hours
 lagbhag 7 se 10 din main yah sookhkar sharir se alag ho jaati he tathaa iske sthaan par ek batan ke aakaar kaa daag sharir par rah jaataa he jisko naabhi kehete hai
 As long as it remains on the body it is necessary to maintain it
 ise pratidin din main do baar doctori rooyee se spirit ke sahaayta se saaf karnaa tathaa keetanunashak dawa kaa upyog karnaa chahie
 After tearing of the amniotic membrane, this pulse exits several times before the baby is born
 yah avasthaa yah avgat karaati he ki baccha apane samay ke anusaar chota, shaareerik trutiyaan, garbh main bachche kii asaamanya avasthaa yaa garbhashay main emniotic drav kaa adhik maatra hona pramukh kaaran hota he
 After coming out of the pulse from the vulva, blood flow starts to decrease in the pulse, due to the constant pressure on the pulse between the head pressure of the baby and the bones of the mother's hip, sometimes blood circulation stops completely
 is avasthaa main bachche kaa taapmaana va rakt kam hone ke kaaran baccha garbh main hi mar jaataa he
 For this reason, it is beneficial to prompt delivery in this stage or to perform delivery by operation
 kai baar naad kii is prakaar kii avasthaa prarambh main maaloom nahin ho paati he
 To know this condition, one has to examine by clot
