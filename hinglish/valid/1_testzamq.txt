 Mahabharata is one of the major poetic texts of Hindus, which falls in the history category of Smriti
 kabhi kabhi ise keval "bharat" kaha jaataa he
 This poetry is a unique religious, mythological, historical and philosophical book of India
 vishwa kaa sabase lanbaa yah saahitiyik granth or mahakavy, hindu dharm ke mukhyatam granthon main se ek he
 This book is considered the fifth Veda in Hinduism
 yadhyapi ise sahitya kii sabase anupam kritiyon main se ek mana jaataa he, kintu aaj bhi yah granth prayek bhartiya ke liye ek anukaraniya strot he
 This work is a saga of the history of ancient India
 isi main hindu dharm kaa pavithratam granth bhagavadgita sannihit he
 There are approximately 1,10,000 verses in the entire Mahabharata, ten times more in magnitude than the Greek poems Iliad and Odyssey
 hindu manyataon, puranic sandarbho evam swayan mahabharat ke anusaar is kavy kaa rachanaakaar vedavyas ji ko mana jaataa he
 The author of this poem, Ved Vyas ji, in his unique poetry has depicted the greatest mysteries of the Vedas, Vedangas and Upanishads
 iske atirikt is kavy main nyaay, shiksha, chikitsa, jyotish, yudhniti, yogashastra, arthshaastra, vaastushastra, shilpashaastra, kaamshaastra, khagolavidya tathaa dharamshastra kaa bhi vistaar se varnan kiya gaya hai
 It took 3 years for Ved Vyas ji to complete the Mahabharata, it may be because writing script art had not developed so much at that time, it was safe to remember the traditional Vedic texts by the sages in that period from generation to generation
 Used to be kept
 us samay sanskrit rishiyon kii bhashaa thi or brahmi aam bolchaal kii bhashaa hua karti thi
 In this way the entire Vedic literature was memorized orally by the sages for generations and generations
 phir dhire dhire jab samay ke prabhaav se vaidic yug ke patan ke saath hi rishiyon kii vaidic saahitiyon ko yaad rakhane kii style lupt ho gayi tab se vaidic sahitya ko pandulipiyon par likhakar surakshit rakhane kaa prachlan ho gaya
 It is well accepted that the modern form of Mahabharata is made through many stages
 vidwaanon dwaara isaki rachana kii chaar praarambhik avasthaaen pahachaani gayi hai
 These stages are as follows in the possible composition time order: saraswati nadi Dwarka devin saraswatin chaiv tato jayamudirayet
 
 mahabharat chandravanshiyon ke do pariwaron kaurav or pandav ke bich hue yuddh kaa vrittant he
 The struggle for land between 100 Kaurava brothers and five Pandava brothers eventually led to the Mahabharata War
 is yuddh kii bhartiya or pashchimi vidwaanon dwaara kai bhinn bhinn nirdhaarit kii gayi tithiyaan nimnlikhit hai- Main mention: Detailed story of Mahabharata puraanon ke anusaar brahma ji se atri, atri se chandramaa, chandramaa se budh or budh se ila-nandan pururava kaa janm hua
 From him, Yayati was born to King Nahusha and Nahusha to Age
 yayati se puru hue
 The dynasty of Puru included Bharata and King Kuru in the clan of Bharata
 kuru ke vansh main shantanu hue
 Ganganandan Bhishma was born from Shantanu
 shantanu se satyavati ke garbh se chitrangad or vichitraveery utpann hue the
 Killed by Gandharva named Chitrangad and King Vichitravirya, who was suffering from Rajyakshama, died
 tab satyavati kii ajna se vyasaji ne niyog ke dwaara ambika ke garbh se dhritarashtra or ambalika ke garbh se pandu ko utpann kiya
 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons by Gandhari, of which Duryodhana was the eldest and Pandu had five sons like Yudhishthra, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva etc
 dhritarashtra janm se hi netraheen the, atah unki jagah par pandu ko raja banaaya gaya
 Once, while playing the game in the forest, a moth-headed mrigarupadhari sage died from the arrow of Pandu
 us rishi se shaapit ho ki "ab jab kabhi bhi tu maithunarat hoga to teri mrityu ho jaayegi", pandu atyant duhkhi hokar apni raniyon sahit samast vaasanaon kaa tyaag karke tathaa hastinapur main dhritarashtra ko apana kaa pratinidhi banaakar van main rahane lagen
 At the behest of King Pandu, Kunti invited religion from the mantra given by the sage Durvasa to Yudhishthira and later to Bhima from Vayudev and Arjuna from Indra
 kunti se hi us mantra kii diksha le maadri ne ashwanikumaron se nakul tathaa sahadev ko janm diya
 One day, while traveling on the banks of Sarita in the forest with Raja Pandu Madri, Pandu became agitated due to his fickleness which led to his death
 maadri unke saath sati ho gai kintu putron ke paalan-poshan ke liye kunti hastinapur laut ai
 Before marriage, Kunti gave birth to Karna from the Sun's share and in the fear of localism, Karna was drowned in the Ganges river
 dhritarashtra ke sarathi adhirath ne use bachaakar uskaa paalan kiya
 Karna was interested in warfare, so after Dronacharya's refusal, he got education from Parashurama
 shakuni ke chhalkapat se duryodhana ne pandavon ko bachapan main kai baar maarane kaa praytn kiya tathaa yuvavastha main bhi jab yudhisthir ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to laksh ke bane hue ghar laakshagrah main pandavon ko bhejkar unhen aag se jalaane kaa praytn kiya, kintu vidura kii sahaayta ke kaaran se ve us jalte hue grih se baahar nikal gayi
 The Pandavas went from there to the city of Ekchakra and after making a costume of the Muni, resided in the house of a Brahmin
 phir vyas ji ke kehane par ve paanchal rajya main gayi jahaan draupadi kaa swayamvar honevaala tha
 There, one after the other, all the kings and princes tried to target the fish, but success was not lost
 tatpashchaat arjuna ne tailpaatr main pratibimb ko dekhte huye ek hi baan se matsay ko bhed daalaa or draupadi ne aage bad kar arjuna ke gale main varmala daal deen
 According to the promise of Mother Kunti, the five Pandavas received Draupadi as a wife
 draupadi ke swayamvar ke samay duryodhana ke saath hi saath drupad,dhridhyumna evam anek anya logon ko andeh ho gaya tha ki ve paanch brahman pandav hi hai
 Hence, Drupada invited him to his kingdom to test him
 rajaprasaad main drupad evam dhridhyumna ne pehle rajkosh ko dikhaaya kintu pandavon ne vahaan rakhe ratnabhushanon tathaa ratna-maaniky aadi main kisi prakaar kii ruchi nahin dikhaai
 But when they went to the armory, they all showed great interest in the weapons kept there and kept the weapons of their choice
 unke kriya-kalap se drupad ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ye brahmanon ke rup main pandav hi hai
 Before Draupadi Swayamvar, all the Pandavas except Vidur were considered dead and due to this Dhritarashtra made Duryodhana the crown prince
 grihayuddh ke sankat se bachane ke liye yudhisthir ne dhritarashtra dwaara die khandahar swarup khandav van ko aadhe rajya ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 There, Arjuna, along with Shri Krishna, defeated all the gods in battle and burnt Khandavavan and satisfied the fire made by Indra by ridding himself of his arrows
 iske falswarup arjuna ne agnidev se divya gandiv dhanush or uttam rath tathaa shrikrishna ne sudarshan chakra praapt kiya
 Indra was shocked to see the valor of his son Arjuna
 unhone khandavaprastha ke wanon ko hataa diya
 After that the Pandavas beautified the city with the help of Maya demon along with Shri Krishna
 vah shahar ek dwitiya swarg ke samaan ho gaya
 At the behest of Indra, Dev Shilpi Vishwakarma and Maya Demon together built the Khandava forest into a grand city like Indrapuri, which was named Indraprastha
 pandavon ne sampoorn dishaao par vijay pate hue prachur suvarnrashi se paripurna rajasuya yajna kaa anushthan kiya
 His splendor became unbearable for Duryodhana, so Shakuni, Karna and Duryodhana etc
 instigated the yoke with Yudhishthira and won his brothers, Draupadi and his kingdom by treacherous gaming and laughing and expelling Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha
 Tried
 parantu gandhari ne aakar aisa hone se roak diya
 Dhritarashtra once again ordered Duryodhana to gamble with him
 yah tay hua ki ek hi daanv main jo bhi paksh haar jayega, ve mrigcharm dhaaran kar baarah varsh vanvaas karenge or ek varsh agyatavaas main rahenge
 If they are recognized even in that one year, then they will have to suffer twelve years of exile again
 is prakaar pun jue main parrast hokar yudhisthir apane bhaaiyon sahit van main chale gayi
 After the twelfth year there, he went to Virat Nagar for one year of exile
 jab kaurav viraat kii gauon ko harkar le jane lage, tab unhen arjuna ne parrast kiya
 At that time, the Kauravas had recognized the Pandavas, but their unknown residence was completed by then
 parantu 12 varsho ke gyaat or ek varsh ke agyatavaas puraa karne ke baad bhi kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya
 Bhishma fought for ten days and killed most of the Pandava army with his arrows
 bhishma kii mrityu unki ichha ke adheen thi
 On the suggestion of Shri Krishna, the Pandavas asked Bhishma the remedy for his death
 bhishma ne kaha ki pandav shikhandi ko saamne karke yuddh lade
 Bhishma considered her to be a girl and after getting him in front, he was not going to wield weapons
 or shikhandi ko apane purv janm ke apmaan kaa badla bhi lenaa tha uske liye shivaji se vardaan bhi liya ki bhishma ki mrityu kaa kaaran banegi
 10 In the battle of the day, Arjuna placed Shikhandi on his chariot, and seeing Shikhandi in front, Bhishma gave up his bow and Arjuna with his sack put him to sleep on the bed of arrows
 tab acharya dron ne senapatitv kaa bhaar grahan kiya
 Again there was a fierce war on both sides
 viraat or drupad aadi raja dronrupi samudr main dub gayi the
 But when Pandavo convinces Drona that Ashwatthama was killed
 to acharya dron ne niraash hon astr shastr tyagkar uske baad yoga samadhi le kar apana sharir tyaag diya
 At such a time, Dhrishtadyumna cut the forehead of Drona with a sword for yoga samadhi and dropped it on the ground
 dron vadh ke pashchaat karn kaurav sena kaa karnadhaar hua
 Karna and Arjuna had a great war-like battle involving weapons and weapons, which was also going to defeat the devasur-sangram
 karn or arjuna ke sangram main karn ne apane baanon se shatru-paksh ke bahut-se veeron kaa sanhaar kar daalaa
 Although the war was getting stale, Karna got entangled when a wheel of his chariot got stuck in the earth
 guru parashuram ke shaap ke kaaran vah apane ko divine astron ke prayog main bhi asamarth paakar rath ke pahie ko nikaalane ke liye neeche utarataa he
 Then Krishna asks Arjuna to kill him by reminding him of the Abhimanyu slaughter, the prostitute and his vow to slay Karna at the Kuru Sabha, then Arjuna beheads Karna with a divine weapon
 tadnantar raja shalya kaurav-sena ke senapati hue, kintu ve yuddh main aadhe din tak hi tik sake
 King Yudhishthira killed him by noon
 duryodhana kii sari sena ke maare jane par ant main uskaa bhimsen ke saath gada yuddh hua
 Bhima slapped him on the thigh and killed him
 iskaa pratishodh lene ke liye ashwatthama ne raatri main pandavon kii ek akshuhinee sena, draupadi ke paanchon putron, uske paanchaladeshiy bandhuon tathaa dhridhyumna ko sadaa ke liye sula diya
 Then Arjuna defeated Ashwatthama and took out the gem of his head
 phir ashwatthama ne uttara ke garbh par brahmastra kaa prayog kiya
 His womb was often burnt by his weapon, but Lord Krishna gave him life again
 uttara kaa vahi garbhasth shishu aage chalakar raja parakshit ke naam se vikhyath hua
 At the end of this war, Kritavarma, Kripacharya and Ashwatthama, three Kauravapaksiyas and five Pandavas, Satyaki and Sri Krishna, these seven Pandavapakshiya heroes survived
 tatpashchaat yudhisthir rajsinghaasana par asin hue
 Yadavakul was killed due to the curse of Brahmins and Gandhari
 balbhadraji yoga se apana sharir tyaag kar sheshnag swarup hokar samudr main chale gayi
 One day, all the great-grandchildren of Lord Krishna, to see the power of the great men, made one a woman and went to the sages and asked, o Munishreshtha! This woman is from the womb, tell us who will be born from her womb? The sages came to know that this child had brought a man to them, making them a woman
 muniyon ne krishna ke prapautron ko shrapa ki is maanav ke garbh se ek moosal likalegaa jisase tumhaare vansh kaa ant hoga
 Krishna's great-grandchildren rubbed that pestle on a stone and threw it into the river and threw its tip
 us churna se utpann vriksh kii pattiyon se sabhi krishna ke praputra mrityu ko praapt kiye
 Seeing this, Shri Krishna also sat meditating under a tree
 'zaraa' naam ke ek vyaadh ne apane baan kii nok par moosal kaa nok laga diya tathaa bhagwaan krishna ke charankmal ko mrug samajhakar us baan se prahaar kiya
 The kiss of Krishna's feet by that arrow caused his paramdham to go
 prabhu apane sampurna sharir ke saath golok prasthaan kiye
 The sea then submerged Dwarkapuri in its waters
 tadnantar dwarka se laute hue arjuna ke mukh se yadavon ke sanhaar kaa samachar sunakar yudhisthir ne sansar kii anityata kaa vichaar karke parakshit ko rajasan par bithaaya or draupadi tathaa bhaaiyon ko saath le himalay kii taraf mahaprasthaan ke path par agrasar hue
 Except Yudhishthira in that Mahapath, all fell one by one
 ant main yudhisthir indra ke rath par arudh ho bhaaiyon sahit swarg ko chale gayi
 More here ga: vichitraveery ke nidhan ke baad vyas se dhritarashtra or pandu kaa janm hua
 Ch: Karna was born before her marriage to Kunti

 dow camel kishor goyanka ke anusaar sozewatan kaa prakaashan june 1908 main hua tha jabaki sansaarik prem or deshprem april 1908 main prakashit ho chuki thi
 The story is written based on the life of Italian nationalist Magini and his girlfriend Magdalene
 yah desh kii aazaadee ke liye aamaran sangharsh karne kii bhaavana ko abhivyakt karti he
 This is a story that gives importance to national love over personal love
 1 landan ke badchalni ke akhaade main italy kaa namvar deshpremi magini desh ke atyaachaari shashan or gulaami par chintit he
 Rafieti, the son of an exiled friend of Italy, Amir, brings his new coat of biscuits and cigarettes for Jozef, who does not eat tomorrow evening without worrying about Christmas
 magini ne uski bimaari ke samay doctor kii fees ke liye premika megdalin kii anguthi bech daali thi
 2 On Christmas day Sara London is happy but Magini and Rafeti are sitting in a dark room
 magini ne khaanaa nahin khaaya he or subah se cigarette bhi nahin mili he
 Then a bunch of Christmas presents came to Magdalene's letter
 switsraland ke ek rais kii anindy sundari beti vahaan magini ke bitaye kuch dinon main usase parichit hui or phir prem karne lagi thi
 But Magini sacrificed himself on the country
 isliye usne megdalin kii khud ko swikaarne kii prarthana asweekaar kar di thi or deshhit kii chintaa karte hue maaraa-maaraa phirane laga tha
 Mazzini, in a letter of confession, considered herself unsuitable for Magadonil and thanked her for the gift and prayed for her health
 3 iske bahut din baad italy main janata ke rajya kaa elaan kiya gaya or magini sahit teen vyakti rajya kii dekhbhaal ke liye niyukt hue
 But due to the excesses of France and the betrayal of the Emperor of Piedmont, the kingdom of the people was shattered and Magini began to scour the streets of Rome
 uske doston rafeti, rasarino, palino, barnabas aadi ne maukaparasti dikhaai or usase dagaa kii
 He continued to call Magini worse than Magdonil, but he did not believe it
 magini ke khud ko kamjor kehane ne use magadonil ke dil main or pratishthit kar diya
 But it was Hikmat Magini
 taaki magadonil uske dil se apana khyal nikaal de
 The effect was reversed and Magdonil arrived at an inn in Rome
 magini ko vah dur se prasann dekhati magar jab usapar asafalataaon kaa waar hua to vah use aa mili
 6 The magini went from Rome to London for a long time and then after hearing the news of the Sicilian outrage, reached Sicily to lead the rebellion
 magar vahaan vidroh kaa daman ho chukaa tha
 The royal army arrested him as soon as he got off the ship and then released the old magini in fear of dying
 magini ne janata main chetana failaane ke uddeshy se sweetsraland jaakar akhbaar nikaalnaa shuru kiya
 He died of pneumonia a year later while on his way to London for health benefits in the foothills of the Alps
 magdonil ne uske kabr par phool chadaaye or uske naam se ashram kholkar mufalis auraton or garib ladakiyon kii seva suru kii
 His ashram was like a home for any newcomer
 teen saal baad uski mrityu ho gai or uski vasiyat ke anusaar use usee ashram main dafna diya gaya
