 Then why should he be left behind? phul stopp kaa prayog na karne ke paksh main ek thos tark yah bhi he ki hindi main 'bindi' kaa bahut adhik upyog hota he - nukta ke rup main, bahuvachan suchit karne ke liye, dashamalav chihn ke rup main, or ng jaise kuch aksharon main to vah pehle se hi vidyaman he
 In this way, in Hindi, the word Bindi is placed all over the front, back, top, bottom
 ab viraam chihn ke liye bhi uskaa upyog karne se baari gadabadi fail jaaegi
 The second is related to its appearance on the computer screen
 bahut kam pixel aakaar main bindi thik se nahin dikhaai detii he athwa uske aas-paas ke pixlon main vah villin ho jaati he
 Therefore, the dot of 'hindi', 'read', etc
 is not visible in very small type cices

 ludwig vitgenshtin austria ke darshanik the
 He worked mainly on logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language
 unki gananaa beesvin shatabdi ke mahanatam darshanikon main hoti he
 Only one book was published in his life - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 baad kii prakashit pustakon main Philosophical Investigations kaaphi charchit rahi
 Wittgenstein has been a professor at the University of Cambridge
 vitgenshtin ke pita karl ek yahudee the jinhone baad main protestant dharm apana liya tha
 Wittgenstein's greatest contribution is to put language in a philosophical perspective
 aaj koi bhi bhashaa vigyaan main jab darshan kaa ullekh karata he to vitganstin kaa naam swatah samaran hota he
 Wittgenstein's writings have resulted in considerable argumentation, even many times Wittgenstein's work has been called a paradox, but it would be wrong to say that logicians had emphasized logical analysis of language even before Wittgenstein
 vitganstin ke guru bartrand rasal rahe hai kaa tarkshastra ko darshan main uchit sthaan dilaane main baari yogadan he
 Wittgenstein's philosophical life is quite interesting because he has refuted his earlier works in his later works
 apni pehle kii pustakon main vitganstin satya ke liye bhashaa kaa mahatv bataate najar aate hai kintu apni antim pustak "philosophical investigations" main vitganstin ne bhashaa main vyaapt bis kaa vivaran kiya he
 Wittgenstein's conclusion proved to be new and important to the philosophical world
 vitgenstin ne ek prakaar se is vichaar kaa pratipaadan kiya ki bhashaa se satya kaa vivaran nahin balki satya kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 All western philosophy is rooted in language, but language shows us only one form of truth, the truth which we create by our belief or experience
 vitgenstin baar baar ek bhashakreedaa kaa ullekh karte hai, jisamen bhaag lene vaale kisi satya kii abhivyakti ke liye bhashaa kaa nirmaan va upyog karte hai
 Through this play, we tell the difference in the facts and truths related to the Wittgenstein language
 apni nirnaatmak pustak "philosophical investigations" main wo kehete hai ki " adhiktar baar jab ham shabd ke "arth" kii baat karte hai, tab ham keval ek bhashaa main us shabd ke yojan kii baat karte hai "

 iske saath hi nawab ne mehadi hasan ko khillaat kii padavi di va saath hi bahut se uphaar va rupee bhi diye

 According to his opinion, this world is not a spread of falsehood or maya, but is a spread of Brahma, so it is true

 ek ne bhagwaan kii lokranjankaree saundaryapratimaa kaa sanghathan kiya to duusare ne uske shakti, sheel or saundaryamay lokmagalakaari rup ko prakashit kiya
 Ramakavya's supreme splendor appeared in the poetry of Tulsidas, the author of "ramcharitmanas", who was the greatest genius of Buddhadev after Buddhadev in the eyes of the scholar Grierson
 par kavy kii drushti se tulsi kaa mahatv bhagavan ke ek aise rup kii pariklpana main he jo maanviya samarthy or audaatya kii ucchtam bhoomi par adhishthit he

 He successfully used all the poems in his time
 prabandh or muktak kii saahitiyik shaileyon ke atirikt lokprachlit avadhi or brajabhasha donon ke vyavhaar main ve samaan rup se samarth hai

 Traditions in Indian popular cinema are made up of 6 major influences
 pehla; pracheen bhartiya mahakavyon mahabharat or ramayana ne bhartiya cinema ke vichaar or kalpana par gaharaa prabhaav choda he visheshkar kathanak par
 Examples of this effect are the accompanying story, the back story and the technique of story within the story
 In the plot of popular Indian films, the story often spreads to sub-narratives, the plot can be seen in the 1993 film Khalnayak Aur Gardish
 doosraa : pracheen sanskrit naatak, apni shailibaddh swarup or pradarshan par mahatv ke saath sangeet, nrity or bhav bhangima milakar " jeevant kalatmak ikai kaa nirmaan karte hai jahaan nrity or anukaran / swang naatakeey anubhav kaa centre hai"
 Sanskrit plays are also known as Natya
 natya shabd kii utpatti "nrit" shabd mul se hui he jisase sanskrit naatak ke bhavy nrity naatak charitra kaa pataa chalata he jis parampara kaa paalan aaj bhi hindi cinema main ho rahaa he abhinay kii raas vidhi jisaki utpatti pracheen sanskrit naatak ke kaal main hui thi, ek mul gun he jo jo bharitay cinema ko pashchimi cinema se bhinn karata he
 In the Raas Vidhi, the actor exhibits a "sense of empathy" that the viewer feels is in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become the "living awakening avatar" of his character
 " abhinay kii raas paddati lokapriy hindi film abhinayta jaise amitabh bachchan or shahrukh khan or desh bhar main priy film jaise rang de basanti, or antarashtriya str par saraahi gayi satyajit re ke filmo bhi dikhataa he
 Third: The traditional folk Indian theater, which became popular after the fall of Sanskrit drama in the 10th century
 in kshetreey prathaon main bengal kii jatra, uttar pradesh kii ram lila, karnataka kaa yakshagan, andhra pradesh kaa chindu naatakam, or tamilnadu kaa terukkutu he
 Fourth: Parsi theater, which presents realism and fantasy, music and dance, plot and performance, ground dialogue and a mastery of stage performances, all of them together in a dramatic address by Atinatak
 parsi naatakon main bhonda hasya, madhur gane or sangeet, sansanikhej or chakachaundh stage kala hoti he
 "all these effects are evident in the masala films made by filmmakers like Manmohan Desai in the 1970s and 1980s
 iskaa udahaaran hai kuli or haal hi main samikshakon dwaara prashansit rang de basanti 
 Fifth: Hollywood in the 1920s to 1950s when musical films were popular there, though Indian filmmakers differed from their Hollywood counterparts in many ways
 udahaaran ke liye hollywood kii sangitamay film kaa plat adhiktar manoranjan kii duniya main hi hota tha jabaki bhartiya filmkaar lokapriy filmo main fantasy ke tatwon ko badhaate hue geet-sangeet or nrity ko kai paristhitiyon main abhivyakti kaa ek prakritik madhyam kii tarah istemaal karte the
 Mythology, history, fairy tale etc
 along with song and dance is an Indian tradition
 iske atirikt "jahaan hollywood ke filmkaar apni filmo ko nirmit swarup ko chhipaane kii koshish karte hai taaki yathartwaadee kathanak puri tarah se pradhan rahe, bhartiya filmkaar is tathy ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karte kii screen par dikhaaya gaya drishy ek kriti, ek maaya, ek kalpana he
 But he mixed his work with people's daily life in interesting and complex ways
 " ek or prabhaav pashchimi mujeec video hai jinka 1990 ke baad se kaaphi prabhaav padaa he jise nrity kram, camera angel, gati or sangeet meme bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 An early example of this is Mani Ratnam's' Bombay
 lokapriy bhartiya cinema kii tarah bhartiya samaantar cinema par bhi bhartiya theatre or bhartiya sahitya kaa prabhaav padaa he lekin antarrashtriya prerana ke rup main us par european cinema khaas taur par italian navayathartwaad or french kaavyatmak yathartwaad) kaa hollywood ke mukaable zyaada asar padaa he
 Satyajit Ray has called the Italian film filmmaker Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves and French filmmaker John Raynor's The River, an inspiration for his debut film Pather Panchali
 re ne apane aap ko european cinema or bengali sahitya ke alaava bhartiya theatre kii parampara khaas taur par shastreey sanskrit naatak kii raas paddati kaa bhi karzdaar mana he
 In Raas, the characters not only feel emotion but also depict the audience in an artistic form and this is the double depiction seen in the Apu trilogy
 
 bimal roy kii do bigha zamin bhi de sika kii bisical thivs se prerit thi or isane bhartiya nayi lahar kaa maarg prashast kiya jo french nayi lahar or japani nayi lahar kaa samakaleen tha
 Some Indian films of the 1930s are known as "multilingual"
 in filmo ko milti julati lekin asmaan roopaantar main vibhinn bhashaaon main shoot kiya gaya tha
 According to Rajadhyaksha and Willeman in the Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema, a multilingual film in its exact form ek bahubhashi yaa tribhaashi ek prakaar kii film he jo 1930s main studio yug main bani thi, jisame alag bhashaaon main har drishy ke alag lekin samaan shot liye jate the jisame abhinayta alag hote the lekin takaniki karmi or sangeet ek hote the

 haalanki 1990 main mul 204 minute kaa mul sanskaran bhi home media par uplabdh ho gaya tha
 Sholay first received negative reactions from critics and weak commercial results upon release, but a few days later it emerged as a huge box office success with the help of favorable verbal publicity
 film ne puure bharat main kai cinemagharon main nirantar pradarshan ke liye record tod die, or mumbai ke minerva theatre main to yah paanch saal se adhik samay tak pradarshit hui
 According to some sources, it is the highest-grossing Indian film when adjusted for inflation
 sholay ek dakaiti-vastern film he, jo vastern style ke saath bhartiya dakaiti filmon paramparaon kaa sangyojan karti he, or saath hi masala filmon kaa ek paribhaashit udhaaharan he, jisamen kai film shaileyon kaa mishran paaya jaataa he
 Scholars have referred to several themes of the film, such as the glorification of violence, the transformation of feudal ideas, the debate between those who uphold social order and organized robbery, gay non-romantic social bonds, and the film as a national framework

 In a small village called Ramgarh, retired police officer Thakur Baldev Singh calls two thieves, whom he once arrested
 thakur ko yakeen he ki ve donon – jai tathaa viru – kukhyat dakait gabbar singh ko pakadaney main uski sahaayta kar sakate hai
 Not only was there a cash reward of fifty thousand rupees for handing over live or dead police to Gabbar Singh, Thakur also offered an additional reward of twenty thousand rupees for bringing both of them alive and bringing Gabbar to him
 gabbar ke teen saathi ramgarh ke graminon se anaaj lene aate hai, par jai or veeru kii vajah se unhen khaali haath janaa padataa he
 Gabbar is very angry when he loses to only two people and kills them all
 iske baad vah holi ke din gaanv par hamalaa karata he or ek lambi ladaai ke baad jai or veeru ko bandhak bana letaa he
 Thakur does not help them despite being in a position to help them both
 jai or veeru kisi tarah batch nikalate hai, or thakur kii is akarmanyata se kshubdh hokar gaanv chhodkar jane kaa man bana lete hai
 Thakur then tells them how he arrested Gabbar a few years ago but he escaped from jail and then to take revenge he first killed Thakur's entire family, and then cut both hands of Thakur
 ise chupaane thakur shawl odhakar rahata tha
 While living in Ramgarh, Jai and Veeru slowly began to like the villagers
 jai ko thakur kii vidhwaa bahu radha or veeru ko gaanv main tanga chalaane vaali basanti se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Meanwhile, there are small squabbles between jai-veeru and Gabbar, and one day his men take Basanti and Veeru away
 jai unako bachaane jaataa he, or ve teenon vahaan se batch nikalate hai
 In this fight, Jai gets shot, leading to his death
 jai kii mrityu se acroshit veeru akele gabbar kaa peechha karata he or use pakad letaa he
 There is a scuffle between the two, in which Veeru is about to kill Gabbar that Thakur comes there and reminds him of Jai's promise to hand Gabbar alive
 veeru gabbar ko thakur ko saunp detaa he, jo apane nukile juuton se gabbar ke haath kuchal detaa he or phir use police ke hawaale kar detaa he
 Veeru leaves the lonely village and leaves for the railway station, where Basanti is waiting for him
 radha ek baar phir akeli hi rah jaati he
 The plan began when, about 6 months after the release of the Zanjeer film, salim-javed met GP Sippy and Ramesh Sippy, telling them the four-line story
 1973 se ve yah kahani kai nirmaataaon ko suna chuke the
 Two producers / directors also rejected his story completely
 ramesh sippi ko unki avadharana acchhee lagi or unhone unhen aage kaary karne hetu chun liya
 According to its actual plan, the film had two ex-soldiers selected by a military officer to avenge the murder of his family
 baad main us sainya adhikari kii jagah ek pulisavaale ne le lee, kyonki sippi ko laga ki is tarah ke drishy dikhaane ke liye anumati milanaa kaaphi kathin rahegaa
 salim-javed completed the story together in a month
 isamen unke naam se lekar un logon ke taur tareeke tak shaamil the
 The screenplay and dialogues of the film are written in hindi-urdu, especially in Urdu only
 saleem-javed ne inhen multah urdu lipi main likhaa tha, or phir ek assistant ne inhen devanagari main anudit kiya, taaki hindi padhane waalon ko bhi ye samaj aaen
 The film is based on Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and is a defining example of a dacoity western film, featuring Indian dacoity films, notably Mehboob Khan's Mother India and Dilip Kumar's Ganga Jamana, and Western films, particularly Se includes conferences from Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western such as Once Upon a Time in the West as well as The Magnificent Seven
 film ke kathanak main kuch tatv anya bhartiya filmon, jaise meraa gaanv meraa desh or khote sikke se liye gaye hai
 a scene depicting an attempt to rob the train was inspired by a similar scene in Ganga Jamna, and has also been compared to another similar scene in the North West Frontier
 thakur ke parivaar ke narsanhaar ko dikhaate ek drishy kii tulana vans apon e time in da west main mcben parivaar ke narsanhaar ke saath bhi kii gai he
 Sholay was also influenced by Sam Peckinpah's westerns, such as The Wild Bunch and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
 charitra gabbar singh ko usee naam ke ek vaastavik daaku par banaaya gaya tha, jiskaa 1950 ke dashak main gwalior ke aasapaas ke gaanvon main aatank tha
 The real Gabbar Singh, when he caught any policeman, cut off his ears and nose and left him, to show him as a warning to other policemen
 yah charitra ganga jamana se bhi prerit tha, jahaan dilip kumaar kaa charitra ganga ek daaku tha, jo gabbar ke samaan hi khadiboli or avadhi ke mishran se bani ek boli bolta tha
 The character was also influenced by the villain "el Indio" of Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More
 suurama bhopali, film kaa ek maamuli charitra, bhopal ke suurama naamak ek jangal adhikari par aadhaarit tha, jo abhinayta jagadeep kaa parichit tha
 Surma eventually had to threaten to sue, when people watching the film also started referring to him as a woodcutter
 sholay ke nirmaataaon ne shuruyaat main gabbar singh kii bhoomika hetu danni denjongpa ko chunaa tha, lekin ve is kirdaar hetu taiyaar nahin hue, kyonki vah pehle hi firoz khan kii dharmatma main kaam karne ke liye hami bhar chuke the, jiskaa filmakan samay bhi sholay ke samaan hi tha
 The second choice of the makers was Amjad Khan
 ve is kirdaar ko nibhaane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye or abhishpt chambal naamak ek pustak padhakar is charitra kii taiyaari karne lage
 This book, about Chambal's exploitation of dacoits, was written by his fellow artist Jaya Bhaduri's father Tarun Kumar Bhaduri
 sanjeev kumaar bhi gabbar singh kii bhoomika nibhaana chaahate the, lekin saleem-javed ko laga ki "unki pehle kii bhoomikaaon ke ke kaaran darshakon main unke prati sahanubhuti thi; gabbar ko puri tarah ghrunit hona tha
 " sippi chaahate the ki jai kaa kirdaar shatrughan sinha nibhaaen, lekin kai anya bade sitare is film main kaam kar rahe the, or isliye sinha ne manaa kar diya
 Amitabh Bachchan did not become so famous at that time; He had to work hard to get this character
 saleem-javed ne haalanki 1973 main hi sholay ke liye bachchan ke naam kii sifarish kar di thi; kyonki zanjeer film main unke abhinay ko dekhakar hi saleem-javed aashwast ho gaye the ki bachchan is film ke liye sahi abhinayta hai
 Because many members of the film had already read the plot, many actors were willing to play different roles
 praan ko pehle thakur baldev singh ke kirdaar ke liye chunaa gaya, lekin sippi ko sanjeev kumaar is kirdaar hetu behatar lage
 salim-javed also spoke to Dilip Kumar for Thakur's character, but he made up his mind at that time; Dilip Kumar later admitted that this was one of the few films he regretted leaving
 dharmendra ko bhi thakur ke kirdaar main ruchi thi, lekin jab unhen sippi ne bataaya ki yadi ve thakur bane to sanjeev kumaar ko viru kaa kirdaar de diya jaayegaa or phir hema malini ke saath unki jodi banegi
 The production of the film took a long time due to its four main characters

 namakan prakriya : The scientific study of the traditional faith is a brief introduction to new discoveries on the sweet relation of human life and religion
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki paraprakritik vishwaas kaa logon ke jivan main lambe samay se mahatva rahaa he, shaaman yaa ojha ke punahnirmit itihaas ke aadhaar par yah avadhi 65000 varsh hogi
 Along with the development of civilization, the traditional belief took the form of religion, and influenced literature, art and society
 anumaan he ki puure vishwa main lagbhag 1 xxrep 4 0 dharm hai, or prayek dharm main anekon alokik tatv 
 Scientists think that, most of the deities are confined to small communities, but some deities must have started to develop in large religions from about 12000 years ago and spread in the world
 pichley kuch dashakon main, paraprakritik vishwaas ke jaivik or saanskrithik udvikas par nai khojon main vaigyanikon ne spasht kiya ki unka aashay kisi alokik tatv kii bhautik satta se nahin tha, unhone paaya ki devi-devataaon main vishwaas samooh ke sadasyon main sahyog, maansik swasthya tathaa sneh kii bhaavana ke vikaas main sahaayak he
 Discoveries in literature and art show that they also have a deep penetration of the traditional faith, and a unique inclusion of supernatural elements, such as a Russell's teapot, flying saucer, spider-man, etc
 devi-devataaon main vishwaas par hue in adhyayanon ke chaar mukhya pahalu gramin parivesh, maansik swasthya, sahyog, or sneh kii bhaavana hai
 Countless articles related to the traditional belief fall into this aspect and reflect the lifestyle of local groups
 aise parichay vishwa, tathaa kshetreey, jaise pashchim himalay, str par, vistrut rup main uplabdh hai
 In these, a rural deity is said to have supernatural, jurist, physician, Mahavira, prophet, etc
 inkaa vistrut varnan bhi he, jaise bharat main, himachal pradesh ke kinnaur jile ke lok devtaa, or unase sambandhit, geet, kathaayen, lokoktiyaan, natya, bhashaa, tathaa paramparaayen, or inke abhipraay
 In another endeavor, the deity of Kinnaur is the main part of Aranyak sheep and goat farming, the main lifestyle there
 in sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, ek itihaaskaar kii raay he ki sthaneey vikaas ke kaaryakramon main, lok chetana kii nirnay lene main bhoomika ho
 Under the second aspect are the studies in which traditional belief, diversity of supernatural elements, and changes in them were linked to mental health
 ashis nandi ke lekh main bharat ke taintis karod devi-devtaa jo chote-chote samoohon kii jivan shaileyon ke pratibimb hai, jinamein is badlaav ke sakshya in devi-devataaon ke bahari pratikon or paramparaon, tathaa jan maanas kii gaharaai main dekhe gaye
 Taking another reference, Sudhir Kakad did not decide the role of supernatural elements in mental health, in a country like India, by bringing spirituality gurus engaged in exorcism and the message of liberation, according to the ideology of psychoanalysis
 Also studied accurately
 man kii anya vichaardhaaraon, manochikitsa tathaa nrivigyaan, main hue adhyayan maansik swasthya main alokik tatwon kii sakaaratmak bhoomika ke pakshdhar hai
 The third aspect is in the context of discoveries in social biology and evolutionary psychology on traditional beliefs and local traditions
 madhav gadgil or unke saathiyon dwaara dev van kii pratha or iskaa jaivik smapda ke sangrakshan main yogadan kaa adhyayan, jaivik or saanskrithik, donon pakshon ko jodta he
 Complex and costly rituals involving supernatural elements were found useful in the development of cooperation in scientific discoveries
 jaigalatas or uske saathiyon ne, hinduon ke thapusam tyohaar main jatil or manhage anushthan karne vaale kwadi ke bhakton kii tulana saadhaaran bhakton se kii, kavadiyon main sahyog kii bhaavana zyada thi
 Their development is possible by group selection, not an individual, the whole group will spread or become extinct
 
 Small groups of people in the world, in which the image of the deity is in the person's mind as the supreme knowledgeable, punisher, and mortuary, is helpful in mutual cooperation
 sankshep main, in khojon kaa mukhya bindu, paraprakritik vishwaas or samaaj main aapasi mail-jol he
 The fourth aspect focuses on studies in which the discovery of traditional beliefs and mutual affection between people
 manovigyaan or isse jude duusare vishyon ke sanyukt prayaas se, man tathaa vyavhaar par dev aasthaa kaa prabhaav jaanane ke liye ye nae prayog hue
 The mainstay of many of these discoveries is to link John Bowlby's theory of affection with faith to supernatural elements
 sneh siddhanth ke chaar sangyanatmak yaa aatanrik praaroop hai, bachche kaa maan, yaa bhakt kaa devtaa, se nikat sambandh, isse bichhudane par virah vednaa, iske sahare parisar kii khoj, tathaa, bahari bhay se isamen aasraa lenaa
 These internal forms, psychologists, formed the basis of experiments to understand the devotee's love for his imperial deity, which yielded positive results
 snapchet ek tasviir or sandesh bhejne vaala mobile ap he, jise evan spigal, bobi murfi or regi brown ne banaaya he
 One of its features is that any message sent in it is automatically erased
 iskaa vichaar unhen stenford vishvavidhyalay main padhai karte samay aayaa tha, jiske baad murfi ne is ap ko banaaya or ye ap july 2011 ko ioes ke liye uplabdh ho gaya
 The app launched in September with its new name "snapchat"
 tasviir bhejne ke baad apane aap mit jane vaala vichaar regi brown ko aayaa tha, is baat ko regi ne evan spigal ko bataaya, jise vyapaar kaa pehle se anubhav tha
 Both of them merged Bobby Murphy with him, as he had experience in making app
 kuch maheene tak teenon saath kaam karte rahe or 8 july 2011 ko in logon ne snapchet ko "pikaabu" naam se ioes ke liye ap laanch kar liya
 Spiegel and Murphy then forced Reggie Brown out of the company
 iske kuch hi maheene baad sitambar 2011 main is ap ko snapchet naam se laanch kiya gaya
 Spiegel said in 2015 that Snapchat was "only for rich people" and did not want it to "expand into poor countries such as India and Spain"
 iske baad se hi bharat ke upyog karne vaale log is ap ko hataane lage or usee ke saath saath google play store or apple ke ap store main is ap ko sabase kam reating "ek-sitara" dene lage
 This caused Snapchat's stock to fall by 1
5%
 uske baad snapchet ne kaha ki "snapchet sabhi ke liye he or puri duniya main muft main downlod kiya ja saktaa he"
 In March 2018, a poll was made about Rihanna that read "would you like to punch Chris Brown or slap Rihanna?" Rihanna then went on to snapchat that "she is insensitive to domestic violence victims" and also asked her fans to remove Snapchat

 Psychosis or schizophrenia is a mental disorder
 isaki visheshtaayen hai- asaamaanya saamaajik vyavhaar tathaa vaastavik ko pahchaan paane main asamarthta
 This disorder is found in about 1% of people
 is rog main rogi ke vichaar, samveg tathaa vyavhaar main asaamanya badlaav aa jate hai jinke kaaran vah kuch samay liye apni jimmedaariyon tathaa apni dekhbhaal karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Both 'psychosis' and 'schizophrenia' literally mean 'breakdown of mind'
 sizophrenia ke kuch pramukh lakshan hai, jaise ki shuruuaat main :- It is not necessary that all these symptoms are seen in every patient, so if any of these symptoms are seen in any person, then he should seek psychiatric advice immediately
 schizophrenia kisi bhi jati, varg, dharm, ling, yaa umr ke vyakti ko ho saktaa he
 Like other diseases, the disease can also be inherited from close family members, so it is more likely to occur in the patient's children, or siblings
 atyadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone dene kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Chemical changes in the brain or sometimes any brain injury can also cause this disease
 neeche die vyavhaarik badlaav rogi ko bigadati avasthaa ke sanket ho sakate hai :- If you feel that a person has these symptoms: - in anaavashyak prabhaavon ke hone par dawa kaa seven roke nahin kyonki yah prabhaav samay ke saath apane aap hi kam ho jate hai tathaa inako rokane ke liye saamaanya si saavdhaaniyaan bhi rakhi ja sakati hai, jaise :- The patient of schizophrenia can lead a perfectly normal life after taking the medication after the main symptoms go away
 vah apni kshamta ke anusaar naukari kar saktaa he, pard saktaa he, dost bana saktaa he tathaa apane sabhi sapane puure kar saktaa he
 a schizophrenia patient can marry after symptom-free, but he has to take care that the new changes in his life do not affect his sleep and medication
 yadi rogi stri hai to vah bina chikitsakeey salaah ke garbh dhaaran na karen
 In children with schizophrenia, the disease can be inherited, but it is not always necessary
 schizophrenia grasit koi vyakti shravan sambandhi vibhram, mithyabhram or asangathit tathaa aswabhaavik soch evam bhashaa pradarshit kar saktaa he; yah vichaar kii shrinkhalaa or vishay pravaah main nuksaan, jisamen vaakya arth kii drushti se keval aspasht rup se sambandhit hote hai, se lekar gambhir maamalon main asambandhata, jise shabd kaa salad kaha jaataa he, tak ho saktaa he
 Social segregation usually arises for various reasons
 saamaajik bodh main kshati sizophrenia se usee prakaar se sambandhit he, jis prakaar mithyabhram or vibhram se pairanoiya ke lakshan or evolision ke nakaaratmak lakshan sambandhit hai
 In an unusual subsystem, may remain stationary in the odd posture, or may display aimless stimuli; These are all symptoms of catatonia
 koi ek lakshan sizophrenia ke nidaan se sambandhit nahin he or sabhi anya chikitsa or maansik sthitiyon main ho sakate hai
 The current classification of psychiatrists assumes that disease symptoms must be present for at least one month over a period of at least six months of disturbed activity
 choti avadhi kii sizophrenia jaisi manovikruti ko chizophrenia rupi vikruti kaha jaataa he
 Late adolescence and early adulthood are the peak times of onset of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia kaa upachaar kiye jane vaale 40% purushon or 23% mahilaon main, yah sthiti 19 varsh kii umr se pehle utpann hui
 These are very important periods in the social and professional development of a young adult and can be severely hampered
 sizophrenia ke prabhaav ko kam se kam karne ke liye, beemaari ke praarambhik charan kii pahchaan karne or uskaa upachaar karne ke liye haal hi main paryaapt kaary kiye gaye hai, jiskaa pataa rog lakshanon ke shuru hone ke pehle 30 maheenon tak lagaaya gaya he, lekin ve adhik lambey samay tak upasthit rah sakate hai
 People who develop schizophrenia experience non-specific symptoms of social breakdown, irritability and restlessness in the early period, and transient or auto-limiting psychosis related symptoms in the early stages before the psychosis becomes apparent
 Can
 manochikitsak kurt shenidar ne manorog sambandhi lakshanon ke roopon ko soochibaddh kiya jise unhone mana ki ve schizophrenia ko anya manorog sambandhi vikaron se bhinn karte the
 These are called first-class signs or first-class symptoms of shenider and they include false illusions in the category of being controlled by an external force; The belief that thoughts are being put into one's conscious mind or withdrawn from it; The belief that the views of one person are being transmitted to other people; And listening for confused voices that comment on a person's thoughts or activities or have a conversation with other confused voices
 haalanki unhone vartmaan naidanik mandandon main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, pratham shrenee ke lakshanon kii vishistataa par prashn uthaaye gaye hai
 a review of clinical studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reaffirmation or rejection of Schneider's claims and suggested that future clinical systems revisions may be the first The emphasis should be on the symptoms of the category
 schizophrenia kaa varnan aksar ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak lakshanon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The term positive symptoms signifies symptoms that are not commonly experienced by most individuals but are present in schizophrenia
 unamem mithyaa bhram, shravan sambandhi vibhram or soch sambandhi vikaar shaamil hote hai or unhen vishesh rup se manovikruti kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he
 Negative symptoms are those that are not present in individuals affected by schizophrenia but are typically found in healthy people, that is, symptoms that reflect a loss or loss of general characteristics or abilities
 aam nakaaratmak lakshanon main neeras yaa kunthit karne vaale prabhaav or manobhaav, bhashaa main kripanata, anand kii anubhuti karne kii aakshamata, sambandh sthapit karne kii ichha kaa abhaav or prerana kii kami shaamil hai
 Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life, functional disability, and burden on others than positive symptoms
 kunthit karne vaale prabhaav kii upasthiti ke baavjood, haal ke adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki schizophrenia main aksar ek saamaanya yaa bhavukta kaa ucch str bhi paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se tanaavpurn yaa nakaaratmak ghatnaon ke pratikriyaswaroop aisa hota he
 a third trait group, disruptive syndrome, is commonly discussed and includes chaotic speech, thoughts, and behavior
 anya lakshan vargeekaran kaa pramaan maujuud he
 The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made based on the morphology of the symptoms
 tantrika sambandhi sahasambandhi vasteen paryaapt rup se upyogi maandand uplabdh nahin karaati he
 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained
 baad ke maandand vishesh rup se europea deshon main prayukt hote hai jabaki DSM maandand sanyukt rajya america or duniya ke baaki hisson main prayukt kiye jate hai or saath hi ve anusandhan sambandhi adhyayanon main prachlit hai
 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication
 manovikruti sambandhi lakshan kai anya maansik bimariyon main maujuud rahete hai, jisamen dwidhruvi vikaar, vyaktitv seemaa rekha vikaar, sickefective vikaar, madhpan, madhpan nashile-padaarth dwaara prerit manovikruti or schizophrenia swarupi vikaar
 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists
 isi kram main ming tsang or uske sahyogi is baat par paricharchaa va bahes karte hai ki manovikruti ke lakshan sabhi main saamaanya ho sakate hai bhale hi iske antim str kii vikruti par vibhinnataayen ho sakati hai, jisamen schizophrenia ko shaamil kiya gaya he, bajaae iske ki schizophrenia kii ateology yaa hetuvigyaan ke vishisht vishaleshan par sachet karte hai ki dsam ke sambandh main bahut kam parichaalanaatmak paribhaasha schizophrenia ke nirmaan par "sahi" uplabdh he
 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
 DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that a high degree of heredity is found in it
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he
 Which is characterized by the trait 6 HLA region under which schizophrenia has been associated with rare deletions or microscopic mimicry of DNA sequences, and contains disproportionately neuro-signaling and brain development genes
 schizophrenia main janankshmata kii kamajori ke vidyaman hone kii bahut hi kam shankaa kii jaati he
 The affected person has fewer children than normal people
 is prakaar kii kami 70% purushon or 30% mahilaon main dekhi gai he
 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later
 ek prakaar ke isi jigyaasu nishkarsh se yah pataa chalaa he ki schizophrenia se prabhavit logon main se zyaadaatar log thand yaa basant ke mausam main janmen the 
 ab iske kai udhaaharan maujuud hai ki janmpurv iske sankraman ke prabhaav main aa jane se jivan ke baad ke varshon main bhi schizophrenia kaa vikaas ho jaataa he, basharte isaki alaava udaahranon main utero pathology or is avasthiti ke vikaas ke jokhim ke bich ko kadi ho
 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia
 saamaajik asuvidha ko bhi iskaa ek kaarak mana gaya he, jisamen garibi or saamaajik vishmata ke kaaran palaayan, rang yaa nasl bhed, parivaar kaa bikharana, berogari or kamjor rahan-sahan vyavastha aata he
 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia
 iske liye aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale do vyakhyaaon main hai "iskaa lagaataar istemaal sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he" or "iskaa lagaataar upyog hi chizophrenia kaa kaaran he" or yah donon baaten sahi hai
 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia
 iske bahut hi kam udhaaharan hai jo yah bataate hai ki sharaab kaa seven sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he, yaa yah ki maansik rup se vyakti kisi vishesh dawa kaa chayan apane swayan ke upachaar ke liye kar letaa he, is sambhaavna kaa sahyog karne vaale kuch hi udhaaharan hai ki dawa kaa prayog pratikul maansik str kaa kaaran jaise maansik tanaav, jigyaasa, pareshaani, ubaaupan or akelepan kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Because psychosis itself is highly understood and metaemphatime can result in the presence of cocaine use or cocaine-based psychosis with similar symptoms, even when the user is avoiding it
 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs, which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls
 haalanki, in adhyayanon ke anusaar wolum main ausat badlaav MRI ke tareekon dwaara tay kii gayi maapan seemaa ke najadik he, isliye yah tay karnaa bhosh rah jaataa he ki sizophrenia ek tantrikana prakriya he jo us samay bhaaru hoti he jab iske lakshan dikhaai padate hai, yaa yah ki ise ek aisi tantrikeey vikaas kii prakriya samajhnaa behatar he, jisamen kam umr main hi mastishk kii asaamaanya maatra taiyaar ho jaati he
 The psychoses of the first episode were associated with a significant reduction in psychiatric antidote drugs such as haloperidal, whereas the excessive decrease in gray matter volume was not associated with unusual psychiatric antidepressants such as olanzepine
 gairmanviya primets ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki aadaar manorog pratirodhi dawaaon or asaamaanya manorog pratirodhi dawaaon, donon main grey or white matter main kami paayi gayi
 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe
 Went across the White Matter tract
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki sizophrenia main white matter tract ke do network prabhavit ho sakate hai, jisase un grey matter kshetron ke 'sampark tut jane' kii sambhaavna rahati he jinase ye jude hote hai
 During fmri studies, a deep correlation between brain default networks and taskpositive networks was observed in schizophrenia patients and may demonstrate a high degree of adaptation to attention to chronological observation and external observation
 adhik virdohi do network ke bich sahasambandh network ke bich atyadhik pratidwandvita pataa chalata he
 There are no reliable measurements for the advanced stages of schizophrenia, although the concomitance of both genetic factors as well as nonadolescent psychoses may provide a better estimate of how later treatment may continue

 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia
 haalanki, manorog pratirodhi ilaajon ke dushprabhavon ke sandarbh main, un logon kaa ilaaj kahin adhik vivaadit he, jo kabhi sizophrenia kaa car nahin hue, vishkar disphigaring taradive diskinesia ke lakshanon vaale or durlabh parantu kahin adhik maarak neuroleptic mailinent syndrome vaale rogiyon main

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia
 is rog se mukti kii avadharana abhi tak vivaadit he, kyonki isaki paribhaasha par koi ekamat nahin he, haalanki lakshno ko dur karne ke liye kuch upaay haal hi main sujhaaye gaye hai
 Effective treatment of schizophrenia is often considered to be dependent on standard methods, one of the most common methods being the measurement of positive and negative symptoms
 lakshno kaa prabandhan or kaaryakshmata ko uyana, rogamukti kii tulana main kahin adhik prabhavi mana jaataa he

 Severe schizophrenia conditions may require hospitalization

 Due to changes in the recruitment process, it is no longer common for this to remain in the hospital for a long time, although it may need to be done

 There is a belief among many non-western communities that schizophrenia can only be treated in more informal, community-controlled ways

 Many practitioners and researchers suspect that differences in respective levels of social engagement and acceptance are one of the reasons, however, that cultural studies are still needed to explain these results

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases
 san 2008 main, yues nashnal institute of mental health dwaara kiye gaye aakasmik pareekshan ke parinaamon main ye paaya gaya, ki ek pratham peedhee ke pratinidhi swaroop paaya jane vaala manovikruti rodhi, paraphanjin, anek naveen dawaaon ke 18 maah kii maatra kii apeksha adhik prabhaavshaalee va kifayati he
 The most unusual psychotic patient wanted to continue, ie olanzhapine, had risks of weight gain and metabolic disturbances
 chlojhapin un marijon ke liye sabase zyada asarkaari tha jo anya dawaaon par koi pratikriya nahin dete the
 Since its trial did not take patients with Tardive dyskinesia, its effects on these types of people could not be ascertained

 This benefit was definitely given, but with obesity and metabolic rate disturbance due to which its use remained questionable for a long time
 khaskar bacchon or kishoron main sizophrenia hone par unhe davaaiyon ke saath hi paariwarik vyavhaar chikitsa bhi di jaani chaiye
 Current criticisms have rebutted the claim that abnormal antipsychotics have some additional pyramidal postoperative effects, especially if it is taken in small quantities or chosen as an anti-psychosis of low potency

 Cognitive behavioral therapy is used for specific symptoms and is used to diagnose other symptoms such as self-esteem, social initiation and insight
 However, the results of prior tests did not reach any conclusion
 chunki ab ye therapy 1990 ke shishav kaal se ab tak kaaphi pragati kar chuki he, haal hi main hue kuch punarnirikshanon se ye maaloom hua he ki CBT kii chikitsa sizophrenia ke psycotic lakshanon par kargar hoti he

 Training of social work has produced both positive and negative results

 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
