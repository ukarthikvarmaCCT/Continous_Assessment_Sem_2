 Perl vyutpann regular oxpraishan ke karyanvayan main ekarupata nahin he or kuch keval Perl kii visheshtaon ke subset ko hi karyanvit karte hai
 The process of Perl 5
10 has reached Perl corporate syntax extensions with its completeness and breadth - originally from Python, PCRE, 
NET Framework and Java
 saral regular oxpraishan aisa vaakya-vinyas he, jinka prayog computer aplication program ke aitihaasik sanskarnon main kiya ja saktaa he evam apane antargat kuch anuprayogon ke dwaara sahyog bhi paa saktaa he
 It has been deemed inappropriate for the purpose of providing previous conformity
 regular oxpraishan main maanak parimaapak laalchee hai arthath ve jitna mail kha sakate hai adhik se adhik utani baar mail khate hai, baaki ko rijex ke saath koi nayaa mail khaane ke liye chhod dete hai
 For example, someone new to regexes who wants to find the first instance between a single item can find between the symbols in this example
 ek or whale explozan, ko ghatit hua
 


 who would like to come with the pattern or similar
 However this pattern would actually like to go back to "" instead of "", which was expected, because * quantification is greedy - so it would want to consume as many characters as possible from input, and "january 26>, "will have more characters than" January 26 "
 haalanki is samasya ko kai tareekon se taala ja saktaa he, aadhunik regular oxpraishan upkaran ek parimank ko sust ke rup main vaishishty paane kii anumati dete hai parimank ke baad ek prashnchihn lagaakar kiya jaataa he, athwa sanshodhak kaa prayog kar jo parimank ke laalach ko ulat detaa he 
 sust parimank kaa prayog kar suchak sabase pehle kam se kam mail khaane kii koshish karte hai
 Although slack mail is used in the preceding example to select one of the results of multiple matches, in some cases it can also be used for better performance, when greedy matching needs to backfire
 
 avyavasthit bhashaaon ke liye pattern aadhunik regular oxpraishan sangrahon se praapt kai visheshtaayen suchak kshamta pradaan karti he jo suvyavasthit bhashaaon se bhi adhik ho jaati he
 For example, many implementations allow the grouping of subindexers and reminds the value of matching in the same indicator
 iskaa arth yah he ki ek pattern duhraaye gaye shabdon kii ladiyon se mail kha saktaa he, jaise ki "papa " athwa "wikiwiki ", jise aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant main squares kehete hai
 The pattern for these battles is \ 1
 haalanki, squares kii bhashaa suvyavasthit nahin he
 Nor is it free from the subject
 back refrences kii aseemit sankhyaon pattern ke saath mail khaataa, jaise ki aseemit sankhya main aadhunik upkaran dwaara samarthit, en pi-sampoorn he 
 However, many tools, libraries and engines that provide such structures still use regular expression terminology for their patterns
 isane regular oxpraishan shabdaawalee kaa namakaran kiya he, jiske aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant tathaa pattern ke kai bhinn arth hai
 For this reason, some people use regex or simply pattern terminology to interpret the latter
 parl programing bhashaa ke lekhak, laire wal ek niabandh main parl 6 ke dizin ke bare main likhte hai: There are at least three different Kalaan methods, algorithms that determine how a given regular expression matches a string
 sabase puraane or sabase tej parinaam par nirbhar do aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant jo prayek garaniyatatmak parimit sthiti yantra ko niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin main roopantarit karnaa sweekaar karata he
 DFA can be explicitly constructed and then consequently operates on the input one symbol at a time
 ek regular oxpraishan ke aakaar ke liye DFA kaa nirmaan "O" kii keemat par karne par samay or smriti aa jaati he, lekin yah n aakaar ke string par hi o samay main chal saktaa he
 An alternative effort is to emulate the NFA directly, essentially creating each DFA position on demand and then dropping it out, possibly caching on the next step
 This keeps DFA implicit and the exponential cost of manufacture can be avoided, but the running cost increases to O
 is spasht padakshep ko DFA kalanvidhi kehete hai or antarnihit padakshep ko NFA kalanvidhi
 jaise ki ek samaan DFA ko kriyanvit karne main donon ko bhinn tareekon se dekha ja saktaa he, unhen bhi bina bhed-bhav ke aksar kalanvidhi kehete hai
 These algorithms are fast, but their use for returning grouped subheads is a tricky quantification and complicates similar features
 teesri kalanvidhi back trek ke dwaara pattern ke saath input string ke milan ke liye he
 This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but the terminology is unclear
 iskaa chalan samay ghaataanki ho saktaa he, jiskaa saral karyanvayan yah ujagar karata he ki jab suchakon ke khilaaf milan jaise ki *b jisame prayaavartan or aseemit parimann donon hi hai
 Emphasize the algorithm to consider the increasing exponential number of substitute cases
 More complex implementations often mark and speed up or cancel simple cases when their behavior is slowed
 haalanki back trekking karyanvayan sabase kharaab sthiti main ek ghaataanki guarantee dete hai, ve bahut adhik lacheelaapan or suchak shakti pradaan karte hai
 For example, any implementation that allows the use of backreferences or implements the various extensions implemented by Perl must use a back tracking implementation
 kuch karyanvayan sabase pehle tej DFA ko chalaakar do sabase acchhee kalan vidhiyaan uplabdh karaate hai, yah jaanane ke liye ki regular oxpraishan string ke saath thoda bhi mail khate hai yaa nahin or keval isi sthiti main sambhawatah mand back trekking milan hota he
 Regular expression was used with the letters ASCII
 kai regular oxpraishan ingine ab sampurna unicode ke saath bhi kaam kar sakate hai
 In most cases there is no difference in what the set of characters is, but in some cases there is a difference when regular expressions have to work on Unicode

 DNA is the chemical that separates us from other animals
 insaan kaa di en e kareeb 3 arab aadhaar jodiyon se bana he, jinke aadhaar ednayin, guanayin, thayamayin or sayitosin he
 They are attached to the chemical bond, which we call hydrogen bond
 isi se di en e kii sthirataa bani rahati he
 If for some reason there are some changes in these base pairs, then we call it mutation
 ham diene ke kuch badlaavon ko philhal 6 virgon main bhaag kar sakate hai
 this is : agar do newcliotide adhaar jodiyon ke bich main, ek nayi aadhaar jodi aa jaye, to use ham newcliotide sangyojan kehete he
 This occurs when, during DNA replication, the DNA polymerase does not function properly, and brings a new base between the two
 syojan ke samay
 An other base is added to that second nucleotide
 isse puure di en e kaa reeding frem badal jaataa he, or naye probhujin kaa vikaas shuru ho jaataa he, jisase kii jivit sharir main khalabali si much jaati he
 If two nucleotides disappear between the base pairs, a base pair for some reason, then we call it nucleotide deletion
 yah tab hota he, jab di en e ke pratikruti ke dauraan, di en e paulimress thik se kaam nahi karata he, or ek nayaa base, dono ke bich main se chalaa jaataa
 This also destroys many proteins of the body as the reading frame changes
 yaha par ek newcliotayid aadhaar jodi duusare main badal jaati he
 For example, A-T bond becomes G-C bond or it can be inverted
 isse reeding frem mekoi parivartan nahi hota
 Only one amino acid changes
 isame ek pureen group ek duusare main aapas main badal jate hai, jisase ke ek asthir bandha banataa he, jisko thik karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 In this, a purine group interchanges with another group of pyridine, again forming an unstable bond, which is difficult for the DNA polymerase to correct
 agar chaaron newcliotidon main se koi apane saamaanya kito rup se inul rup main tabdeel ho jaataa he, to usase yah pareshaani ho jaati he ki koi bhi newcliotide ek duusare ke saath bandha bana saktaa he or isse protein ke banane main gadabadi ho sakati he

 Most DNA defects are done by removing the wrong nucleotides and applying the correct ones
 par phir bhi, kabhi kabhi aisa karnaa sambhav nahi hota
 There are a total of three types of DNN repair: yah tarika kuch pareshaaniyon main bada hi kushal sabit hota he
 It works only in those places, where there are changes every time
 inhe saadhaatar pratyaksh badalav yaa direct repere se thik kiya jaataa he
 This process is called photoreactivation
 ise aisa isliye kehete he, kyonki prakaash kii urja, saichlobuten rings ko todane ke liye kaaphi hoti he
 This ability is available in many animals, such as plants, amoebae, yeast and bacteria
 is prakriya main jo anzaim istamaal hota he, vah he photolayes
 It is a very common means of DNA repair
 isame kshatigrast diene kii pahchaan kar use hataa diya jaataa he, chaahe vah newcliotoid ho yaa phir bases ke rup main ho
 An example of this is the removal of uracil from DNA, the formation of which is a mutagenic phenomenon
 di en e glikosiles vah anzim he, jo yah kaary karne main sahaayta karata he
 This leaves an empty uracil
 di en e glaicosiles duusare asaamaanya bases ko bhi nikaalata he
 It is also called nucleotide excision repair
 yah badlaav tab kaam aata he, jab e--tii yaa ji---si bandha banane ke bajaae, koi or bandha ban jate hai
 It contains 3 proteins
 yah hai - mut es, mut el or mut ech
 In this process, the imbalance in mut S, DNA increases

 Mute h has endonuclease power, which causes it to cut off the mismatch

 dilachasp baat yah he ki apane pehle ank main nagaraj ko dusht vaigyanik profesar naagamani dwaara ek antarrashtriya aatankwaadi hathiyaar ke rup main pravartit kiya gaya tha

 nagaraj apane kaary main safal rahaa, lekin gorakhnath or unke rahasyamay kaale nevale shikangi se muqaabale main parrast ho gaya

ve
 channel ke karmchaaree raaj ke rup main jivan yaapan kar rahaa he
 In ancient times, when the gods roamed the earth without any restrictions, there existed an empire called Takshaknagar, which was ruled by King Taksharaj and Queen Lalita
 shaasha danpati ko koi chintaa nahin thi sivaay ek ke; unki koi santan nahin thi
 The absence of a prince or princess made the sole Nagpash his potential heir
 Nagpash was the identical younger brother of the emperor, who began to live a grand life without knowing that he was the only possible heir to the throne
 jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya, rani apane bachche ke abhaav main udhaas rahane lagi
 raja ko rani ke avsaad kaa kaaran samaj main aa gaya or ve bhi pareshaan rahane lage
 pati-patni ashish ke liye apane paariwarik devtaa dev kaaljayi kii puja karte the
 Dev Kalajayi also knew the reason for his grief, so one day he blessed him to have great children
 unka aashirwad safal hua or jald hi rani garbhvatee ho gai or puure rajya main kushi kii lahar daud gai sivaay nagapasha ke
 The birth of this child meant losing the throne to him, so he decided to kill the child before it was born
 ek din jab rani dev kaaljayi kii puja ke liye ja rahi thi, to nagapasha ne devtaa ke bhoga kii dhaki hui thali main, prasad ko mare hue nevale se badal diya
 Nagadevata felt angry and made the queen unconscious with her venomous breath
 raja ne devtaa se kshamaa yachana kii or apni patni ko thik karne kii prarthana kii lekin devtaa ne aisa karne se inkaar kar diya, jiske baad hataash raaj ne aatmahatya karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Unable to withstand the death of the devotee, Dev Kalajayi told him a way to save the life of the queen
 He gave the gem to the king and asked him to react with the queen's medicine
 Mani will reverse all the poison from the queen's body towards the child's body, but due to the ill effects of the poison, the queen will lose her fertility
 saare rajya main matam chaa gaya or raja bhi dukhi ho gaye
 Nagpash was very happy that he has survived as the heir alone
 jab baccha paidaa hua to sabko laga ki vah mara hua he kyonki uskaa sara sharir nila tha or usamen jivan ke koi lakshan dikhaai nahin die
 According to the practice of the Hindus, the newborn was thrown into the river
 nagapasha kushi se jhum uthaa or sidhe nashe main dhut dev kaaljayi ke paas gaya or unase yah kehete hue shahi khajaane ko saunpane ke liye kaha ki vah singhaasana kaa ekmaatr uttaradhikari he isliye shahi khajaane par uskaa adhikaar he
 Dev Kalajayi refused and told him that the "real heir" of the throne was alive and that the treasury would be handed over to him when the time came
 Enraged, Nagpash raised his sword against the deity but fell away with the mere stroke of a giant snake's tail
 Nagpash fell on two bowls, one containing a highly poisonous toxin, which destroyed his face and merged into his blood and the other contained nectar, which made him immortal
 donon ke ek saath prabhaav ne nagapasha ko ek amar vishaiylla aadmi bana diya
 At that time Nagpash could not bear the change of his body and fainted
 jab raja ko dev kaaljayi ne in ghatnaon ke bare main soochna di to unhen pataa chalaa ki unka betaa mara nahin he or unhen apane jivan ke prati sambhavit khataron kaa bhi ehsaas hua
 Therefore, he ordered his loyal astrologer Vedacharya, a great scholar of Tilism, to preserve the treasure in a Tilism that only his son could break
 Vedacharya prepared Tilism with the help of Dev Kalajayi to ensure that no one of the king's sons, except Amar Nagpash, would be able to break that tilism
 When Nagpash regained consciousness, he realized that he had lost the treasure
 gusse main aakar usne raja or rani kii hatya kar di
 In a life-less condition, the infant got trapped in bushes flowing in the river
 vahaan par vah lambey samay tak padaa rahaa
 Meanwhile, the serpent god Dev Kalajayi Chirayu appeared in the dreams of the wishful serpent ruler King Maniraj and his wife Manika Rani, who were living in a human view hiding in an island in the Indian Ocean called Ojhal Nagadweep
 unhone shishu kaa sthaan bataaya or unase uskaa ilaaj karne ke liye kaha
 unhone kahe anusaar kiya tathaa shishu ko found nikaala or unhen yah bhi pataa chalaa ki vah dweep ke mahaan sarp mahatma kaldoot se bhi zyaada vishaiylla he, jo yah sanket detaa he ki uske paas bhagwaan kaa divya vish he
 Initially Raj Vaidya was unsure whether he would be able to treat the infant or not, but Dev Kalajayi himself had asked the king for treatment, so he was convinced that his treatment would be successful
 According to the rules, no one was allowed to bring any outsider to the island, so the king decided to keep his presence a secret
 kai saal biit gaye or ilaaj kaa parinaam nazar aane laga, haalanki abhi bhi usamen koi jivan-kriya nahin thi, par shishu kaa rang dhire-dhire hare main badalane laga
 raja ne yah samachar rani ko diya or unhone bachche ko god lene kaa nirnay liya kyonki unki apni koi santan nahin thi
 His decision was overheard by the evil Tantric Visandhara who wanted to become the ruler of the island, but was afraid of the Mahatma tenant
 usne gupt kshetra par hamalaa kiya jahaan shishu ko rakhaa gaya tha or usko saath lekar bhaag gaya, lekin ishwar ke prakope se dar kar us shishu ko na maarane kaa faisalaa liya or use nadi kii unheen jhaadiyon main waapas rakh diya jahaan par vah mila tha
 Her plan failed as the queen soon conceived and gave birth to a daughter, named Viserpi
 vishandhar ko kabhi pataa nahin chalaa ki jis shishu ko usne bhatakane ke liye chhod diya tha use hosh aa gaya, pehle uskaa cheharaa or phir uskaa sharir saamaanya maanvon jaisaa bana or usne ronaa shuru kiya
 a priest from a nearby temple saw him and presented him to Professor Nagamani, who was wandering in the nearby forest in search of snakes
 agyaat kaarnon se purohit ne ek juthi kahani sunai ki shishu ek aisi mahila kaa he jiskaa balaatkaar hua tha or jo sarp devtaa kii bhakthin thi or shishu ko ichhadhari naag banane kaa aashirwad praapt he or unhone naagamani se anurodh kiya ki ve uskaa paalan-poshan kuch is tarah kare ki vah apni maa kaa badla le sake
 Nagmani realized that the priests were lying but took the infant with him
 shishu ke rakt pareekshan se pataa chalaa ki uski shwet rakt koshikaon main koon kii jagah sookshm saanp hai
 The child had extraordinary curative powers and was highly toxic
 usne shishu kaa paalan-poshan kiya jo aage chalakar nagaraj bana
 Nagaraja was presented to the world as a creation of Nagmani Professor
 use vishisht hatyara mashin banaaya ja rahaa tha or uski mul yojana thi nagaraj ko duniya bhar ke khalnaayakon or aatankwaadi guton ke bich sabase adhik boli lagane vaale ko kiraye par dena
 Professor Nagmani used it for his other pilot projects and leasing it for international terrorism
 naagamani ne hameshaa daawa kiya ki nagaraj ko saanp ke vish ke ansh dekar, uskaa koon zehar banaate hue uski shaktiyon ko viksit kiya gaya he
 He claimed that his venom is the result of snake bites of 1000 different species and that his powers developed from treatment with the ashes of the dead willful serpent
 vastav main tathy yah tha ki nagaraj kisi bhi saanp kii prajati se zyaada zaharila tha, kyonki uskaa vish alokik tha
 Based largely on the sizing Hindu myth, Nagaraja was empowered by the subtle snakes in his blood cells and was subjected to venomous breath poisoning and biting, immediate healing powers, and ropes, parachutes or protruding from his wrist
 And according to his imagination, there are innumerable supernatural powers like snakes taking different shapes
 mana jaataa he ki agar vah kisi ko kaate yaa koi use kaate, to uske vish main potashium synide se bhi tikshn, kisi bhi jivit praani ke sharir ko galane kii shakti maujuud he
 For his first mission, he was sold for a million and the aim was to acquire an ancient statue
 nagaraj safal hota he, lekin phir sadhu "baba gorakhnath" use naakaam karte hai, jo uske man ko "profesar naagamani" ke niyantran se mukt karte hai
 Waking up in a new world of peace of Gorakhnath, Nagaraj vows to eliminate terrorism from the world and moves towards achieving his goal
 praarambhik ankon main nagaraj kii shaktiyaan bhi simit thim, kabhi-kabhi shaktishaalee maanav virodhiyon se bhi vah haar jaataa tha or asthai rup se behosh ho jaataa tha, uski taaqat bhi kaaphi had tak maanvon jaisi thi jaise vah kisi car uthaane vaale ko dekhakar apane virdohi kii shakti se achambhit ho jaataa tha
 Years later, Nagraj became so powerful that he not only held the falling cars alone but also threw things into outer space with ease
 yah ullekhneey he or shaayad vidambnaapurna bhi ki nagaraj ko ab ek puranic-jaadui praani ke rup main badal diya gaya he jise apane dushman ke rup main vilakshan jeevon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, jisamen jaadu-tona or samay or antariksh yatra ke tatv bhi jude hai
 Many see this as the reason for the continued, overwhelming popularity of Nagraj Comics
 haalanki, shuddhivaadiyon kaa ab bhi daawa he ki ve or adhik yathartwaadee or adhik vyaavhaarik kahaniyon ko pasand karte hai jinase nagaraj kii shuruuaat hui thi
 Nagraj is arguably the most powerful superhero of the royal world and the most powerful wishful serpent of his time
 Again and again, he has shown the ability to challenge Sheshnag, Vasukdev, the great serpent deities and defeated serpents like Kaladoot, Triphaana, Mahavayal and Sheetnag Kumar, who are counted among the most powerful serpents of their species
 apane praarambhik ankon main nagaraj ek ghumkkad tha, jo ek himaskhalan kii bhaanti maanav jati ke dushmano ke liye tabaahi machaa detaa tha
 Since there was no need for a disguised personality, Nagaraj did not have one, but he hid himself in an overcoat and often with a hat to hide his identity
 apni asli pahchaan chhipaane ke liye jis poshaak kaa vah istemaal karata tha, uske prashansakon dwaara use hi chhadam bhes kaa naam diya gaya kyonki aksar kisi ko pataa nahin chalata tha ki uske samaksh khadey rahane vaale vyakti swayan nagaraj he
 Nagraj has adopted the same pseudo-personality in his latest global terrorism series
 apaat sthiti main pahachaane jane kaa bhay na hone ke kaaran kai baar nagaraj saarvajanik taur par apni topi or overkot fouran utaar detaa he
 Her previous pseudo-personality was Raj, a clumsy liaison officer in the fictional company Bharti Communications presented in the story
 vah apane raaj kii gupt pahchaan main, sanpon se darane kaa dikhaava karata he
 He wears glasses and a typical business suit and is a very timid and simple man
 yah superman / clark kent ke charitra se bahut hi miltaa-julata kirdaar he, jisaki veshbhusha, bal suljhaana or khud ko chhipaane ke liye chashmon kaa istemaal bhi usee ke samaan he
 Although the initial pseudo personality was based on Fatam, this pseudo personality is based on Superman
 haal hi main "nagaraj ke baad" shrinkhalaa main apni asli pahchaan ujagar karne ke liye majaboor hone ke kaaran, nagaraj ko paristhitiyon kii vajah se apane chhadam vyaktitv ko dubaara badalanaa padaa
 ab maujuuda kathanak ke anusaar vah nai suraksha agency "sneke aaez" ke prabandhak ke rup main kaam karata he
 His new name is Nagraj Singh
 It is owned by Ms
 Saudangi who lives in her body and is a willful serpent

 There was never a chance to show on screen
 The reason is very clear, due to the poor quality of the special effects, Raj himself was not satisfied with the quality of the episodes of the comics serial
 adhik kadiyon kaa nirmaan kaary anishchit kaal ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya

 yah aadhunik uzbekistan ke samarkand, bukhaaraa, khujand or shahar-e-sabz ke nagaron ke ilaake main faili hui thi
 The people of Sogda spoke a language called Sogdai which was the eastern Iranian language and became extinct with time
 mana jaataa he ki aadhunik kaal ke tajik, pashtun or yagnobi logon main se bahut inhi soudai logon ke vanshaj hai
 Note that the pronunciation of 'G' in 'sogda' is slightly different from 'G'
 sonda ke log swatantraaa-pasand or ladaake maane jate the or unka raashtra iran ke hakhaamani samrajya or shaq logon ke bich sthit tha
 When the Greek forces led by Alexander the Great arrived here in 327 BCE, they captured the famous fort called Sogdai Shila
 unhone bactria or sonda ko ek hi rajya main shaamil kar diya
 Soddai freedom from this died such that it could never come back again
 phir yahan ek unani raajaaon kaa silsilaa chalaa
 In 248 BCE, Diodotos i laid the foundation of yavan-bactrian rule here
 aage chalakar yuthidimos ne yahan sikke gadhe jinaki nakal sabhi kshetreey shaskaon ne kii
 Eukratidis i broke away from Bactria and for some time ran a separate Greek kingdom in Sogda
 150 ipu main shaq or anya banjaaraa jatiyaan akraman karke is kshetra main bas gai or yahan phir unka raaj shuru ho gaya
 China too had thick eyes on this area
 ise pashchimi kshetra kaa hissaa mana jaataa tha or chini khojayatriyon ne sonda ko "kangaju" kaa naam diya
 China invaded this area in 36 BC
 is kshetra se phir china or pashchim ke ilaaqon ke bich vyapaar badhane laga
 Sogda came on the silk route and the Sogdai people got into business with great vigor
 soudai bhashaa madhya asia main vyapaar kii bhashaa ban gai or bahut se gair-soudai bhi ise seekhney-bolne lage
 It is possible that most of the trade between China and India at this time was run by Soddai people
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki samay ke saath sonda main kaafii naitik patan hua or kuuchaa or khotaan main striyon kii bech-kareed hoti thi
 Sogda was incorporated into the Uygur kingdom in the tenth century AD
 isi samay ke aasapaas islam bhi sonda main pahunch gaya or is kshetra kaa islamickaran armbh hone laga
 The sixth century AD is considered to be the peak height of Sogdai culture
 yahan ke adhiktar log shaayad zarthushti dharm ke anuyaayi the lekin mana jaataa he ki sonda par bhartiya samskruti kii gahari chhap thi
 The death-related rituals of many Sogdaiyas met Vedic customs
 yahan agni puja, vaidic devtaa mitra kii surya puja, gandharvon main vishvas or ganga main aasthaa faili hui thi
 There were also towns named Kanka which had a form of 'ganga'
 mahabharat main bhi kanka naamak jati kaa varnan miltaa he
 Apart from this, evidence of worship of five Hindu deities is also found here: Brahma, Indradev, Mahadev, Narayana and Vaisravana
 soudai main 'indradev' ko 'abadaab', 'brahma' ko 'xravan' or 'mahadev' ko 'veshparakar' kaha jaataa tha
 Near the Panjkant city of Tajikistan, these three have also got the pictures of the altar offered

 Modern Tajik language also includes many Sogdai words
 nabhikeey astr yaa parmaanu bam ek visphotak yukti he jisaki vidhvansak shakti kaa aadhaar nabhikeey abhikriya hoti he
 It can be made by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission or by the combination of both these types of nuclear reactions
 dono hi prakaar kii abhikriya ke parinamswaroop thode hi saamagree se baari maatra main urja utpann hoti he
 Today's nuclear weapon, slightly larger than one thousand kilos, can generate as much energy as it can generate from conventional explosives of several billion kilos
 nabhikeey hathiyaar mahavinashkari hathiyaar kahe jate hai
 The most powerful explosive used in World War II was the name 'blockbuster'
 iske nirmaan main tab tak gyaat prabalatam visphotak trinitrotoluin kaa 11 ton prayukt hua tha
 The first atomic bomb, which was 2000 times more powerful than this explosive, was detonated by T
N
 T
 was equivalent to an explosion of 22,000 tons
 ab to pratham parmaanu bam se bahut adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam bane hai
 The detonating substance in a nuclear bomb is uranium or plutonium
 uranium yaa plutonium ke parmaanu vikhandan se hi shakti praapt hoti he
 For this, neutrons are struck in the nucleus of the atom
 is prahaar se hi bahut badi maatra main urja praapt hoti he
 This process is called physicist nuclear fission
 parmaanu ke nabhik ke abhyantar main jo neutron hote hai unheen se neutron mukt hote hai
 These neutrons strike other atoms and cause fragmentation again
 ye phir anya parmaanuon kaa vikhandan karte hai
 This is how chain actions begin
 parmaanu bam kii aniyantrit shrunkhlaa kriyaaon ke falswaroop bheeshan prachandta ke saath parmaanu kaa visphot hota he
 Many isotopes of uranium are known
 saamaanya uranium main 99
3 pratishat you-238 or 0
7 pratishat you-235 rahete hai
 The fragmentation of U-238 is not as easy as the fragmentation of U-235
 you-235 main you-238 kii apeksha teen neutron kam rahete hai
 It is due to this lack of neutrons that fragmentation of U-235 occurs easily
 anya vikhandaneey padaarth jo parmaanu bam main kaam aate hai ve you-233 or plutonium-239 hai
 a nuclear explosion requires critical codes of fissile material
 shrunkhlaa kriya ke chaalu karne ke liye kranthik sanhati nunatam maatra he
 If the amount of fissile material is less than the critical code, then the neutron will only continue to crumble
 maatra ke dhire dhire badhaane se ek samay aisi avasthaa aegi jab kam se kam ek unmukt neutron ek nae parmaanu par prahaar kar uskaa vikhandan kar degaa
 On reaching such a state, the fragmentation process starts running automatically
 kranthik sanhati kii maatra gopneey he
 Only those nations that make nuclear bombs know and do not tell others
 yadi you-235 kii kranthik sanhati 20 pound he to das das pound do jagah lene se shrunkhlaa kriya chaalu nahin hogi
 Taking 20 pounds together will start the chain operation
 shrunkhlaakriya main neutron kii sankhya badi shighrata se badhati he
 Fission in a nuclear bomb raises the heat of uranium and other substances adjacent to it very quickly
 dhatvik uranium badi unchi daab or taap par tapadipt gas main parinat ho jaataa he
 The temperature of the explosive body is 10,00,00,000 ° C
 Wakes up to itane unche taap par uranium kii thapi hat jaati he
 Then the whole body explodes with great intensity
 parmaanu bam ke visphutit hone par aadhaat tarangen utpann hoti hai jo dhwani kii gati se bhi adhik gati se chaaron ore failati he
 When the atomic bomb is detonated above the earth, the waves hit the earth and rise up and create a new shock that spreads up and down intensely
 bam sphot kaa centre tatkaal tapt hokar nirvaat utpann karata he
 The surrounding cold air rushes to fill the vacuum
 is prakaar parmaanu bam se gharon par aghat padane se ve tut jate hai
 Explosive uranium turns into other elements, radioactive rays emanate from it and destroy living cells and destroy them
 bam kaa vinashikari kaary aghat tarangon, vedhi kirnon tathaa atyadhik ooshmaa utpaadan ke kaaran hota he
 Hydrogen bombs are a variety of nuclear bombs
 hydrogen bam yaa ech-bam adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam hota he
 It requires isotopic du terium and tritium of hydrogen
 parmaanuon ke sanlayan karne se bam kaa visphot hota he
 For this fusion, the temperature is very high, about 500,00,000 ° C
 Is required
 yah taap surya ke ooshnatam bhaag ke taap se bahut unchaa he
 Atomic bombs can achieve such high temperature
 america, england, rus, china va bharat ne hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kiya
 North Korea is also believed to have made such a dangerous bomb
 jab parmaanu bam aavashyak taap utpann karata he tabhi hydrogen parmaanu sanlayit hote hai
 This fusion produces heat and powerful rays that turn hydrogen into helium
