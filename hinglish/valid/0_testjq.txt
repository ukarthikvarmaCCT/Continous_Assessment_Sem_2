 The truth is that the importance of bronze was so much in one era that the name of that era of development of human civilization has become 'bronze Age'

 The most important method of making a metal stronger is metalworking
 is disha main 19veen shatabdi main bahut adhik prayaas hua, usee kaa fal he ki anek upyogi kaaryon ke liye aaj paanch hajaar se bhi adhik mishradhatuen uplabdh hai or nai mishradhatuen taiyaar karne ke liye nity nae nae prayog kiye ja rahe hai
 Today alloys with desired properties are made for any particular use
 dhaatuen jab kisi saamaanya vilyan, jaise amla, main ghulti he tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ko chhod detii hai or saadharantaya lavan banaati hai, kintu pighalaane par jab ve paraspar ghulti hai tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ke sahit rahati hai
 Such solid solutions of metals are called alloys
 anek mishradhaatuon main adhatuen bhi alp maatra main hoti hai, kintu sampurna kaa gun dhatvik rahata he
 Therefore, in 1939, the American Board of Examiners made the following definition of alloy - prarambh main mishradhatu kaa adhiktam upyog sikkon or aabhushanon ke banane main hota tha
 Copper, tin and zinc are 95 / 4 and 1 percent respectively in copper coins

 In the United States, silver and copper are 90 and 10 percent of all silver coins, respectively
 england ke sone ke sikken main sona or tanba kramash: 91

 Platinum, gold and silver are used to add beauty to the colors of jewelery, to make them hard, strong and durable, or to mix them with other metals for sale at cheaper prices
 yah nishchay karnaa ki mishradhatuen saadhaaran mishran hai yaa rasinic yogic, ek jatil samasya he
 In some sense, these are chemical compounds, because when sodium succulents are made, then every piece of sodium in the cross causes a strong flame of light and the mercury becomes hot, a symptom of the compound being formed
 isi prakaar pighalate hue sone main jab aluminium dhaatu kaa ek tukdaa daalate hai, tab itani adhik ooshmaa utpann hoti he ki sampurna pighali hui dhaatu ujjwal prakashmay ho jaati he
 The color of many alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 udaahranarth, chaandi or jasta dona shwet rang ke hote hai, kintu inase jo mishradhatu banati he uskaa rang ati sundar gulabi hota he
 Gold is yellow and aluminum is white, but the color of their alloy is very shiny
 yah gun bhi yogicon kaa he
 On extracting the melting point of alloys, it is known that the behavior of alloys is of two types: The melting point of some alloys changes as the content of the metal changes, it is the property of the mixture and the melting point of some alloys is a constant temperature
 Occurs, indicating that alloys are compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke bhautik tathaa rasinic gun apni avyav dhaatuon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai or mishradhaatuon ke gun kisi bhi prakaar se avyav dhaatuon ke gunon ke madhya nahin hote
 This difference is due to the fact that when metals are melted together, they form many interconnected compounds and solid solutions
 mishradhatu kaa ghanatv apni avyav-dhaatuon ke madhya ghanatv se kam yaa adhik ho saktaa he
 The color of some alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 ye apni avyav dhaatuon se kathortar, kintu kam lacheelee tathaa ghaatvarghy or adhik bhangur hoti hai
 The melting point of alloys is always less than the melting point of the melting element at maximum temperature
 or praaia: nunatam taap par pighalanevaali avyav dhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 For example, an alloy containing lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium is faulted at 75 ° C, while the melting point of tin, the metallic ingredient at the lowest temperature, is 232 ̊c
 ye sab ve gun hai jinke kaaran mishradhatuen shuddh dhaatuon se adhik moolyawaan ho jaati hai tathaa udyog main adhik upyogi siddh hoti hai
 As a result of detailed study of the organization and crystalline composition of alloys by the fruits mentioned above and by microscopes, X-ray spectral measurements, thermal and chemical analysis and other physical tests, alloys are placed in three categories
 yah vibhaajan mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuon ke parmaanuon kaa samooh kis prakaar se sangathit he, uske aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 These three categories are the following: is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuen jab pighali hui hoti hai, tab ve ek duusare main ghuli hui rahati hai, kintu thos hone par dhaatuon ke crystal alag-alag ho jate hai, arthath dhaatuen paraspar aviley hai
 In this way, the alloy is a mixture of pure crystals of each element metal, and on cooling, one element separates the metal into solid form
 udaahranarth, ek taral mishradhatu, jisamen matraanusaar 10 bhaag sisa or 90 bhaag tin hote hai, jab thandi kii jaati he tab shuddh tin ke crystal pratham usee prakaar se pruthak hote hai jis prakaar shuddh him ke crystal chini ke tanu vilyan main se thanda karne par pruthak hote hai
 The temperature at which tin crystals begin to separate is lower than the melting point of pure tin
 tin ke galnaank ko jab usamen sisa ghulaa rahata he, gyaat kar sise kaa anubhaar usee niyam dwaara nikaalte hai jis niyam se pani main ghuli vaston kaa anubhaar nikaalte hai
 By this method, several molecules of those metals have been extracted, which remain as separate atoms in the diluent solution
 sisa-antimony mishradhatu mishran shrenee kii he
 Antimony is brittle and lead soft
 mudran dhaatu sisi, antimony or atyant kam maatra main tin kii mishradhatu he
 This alloy has the hardness of antimony, but it is not as brittle as that
 is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main ek avyav dhaatu ke parmaanu duusari avyav dhaatu ke crystalia dhaanche main bhalee-bhanti baith jate hai
 There are two different types of alloys of solid solution: tanba-nikal kii anek mishradhatuen jinka mahatvapurn upyog he, thos vilyan kii shrenee main aati hai
 For example, alloys from which nickel coins, rifle bullets and a wire have high electrical resistance are made
 canada ke bahut se khanijon main tanba or nikal ke sulphide hote hai, jinako galane se ek mishradhatu milti he
 It contains nickel and copper 67 and 28 percent and the remaining five percent contains iron and manganese respectively
 is mishradhatu ko monelle dhaatu kehete hai
 It is more tensile, flexible and corrosion resistant
 saadhaarant: dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar yogic nahin banaatin, kintu ooshmaa vishleshan dwaara gyaat hua he ki dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar bahut adhik sankhya main yogic banaati hai
 The class name of these compounds is interstitial compound
 is prakaar ke sabase adhik yogic kshar or kshareey mitti kii dhaatuen, aavart sarini ke visham upavirgo kii dhaatuon ke saath sanyog karke, banaati hai
 The amount of metals in these compounds is reflected by chemical formulas
 in sutron ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki is prakaar ke yogic sanyojaktaa ke un sab niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai jo dhaatu tathaa adhatu ke sanyog se bananevaale yogicon dwaara pratipaadit hue hai
 For example, sodium, tin and lead are chemically reacted to form the following compounds: anek antaradhaatuk yogic bahut sthaayee hote hai or apane galnaank se adhik taap par garam karne se bhi apni avyav dhaatuon main vighatit nahin hote
 These compounds dissolve in liquid ammonia and thus the solution prepared is an electronegative
 jab inkaa vaidyut apghaton kiya jaataa he, tab ek avyav dhaatu, jo duusari kii apeksha nune dhanvidyuti hoti he, dhanagar par jamati he or duusari runagra par
 There is no theoretical explanation as to why interstitial compounds are formed
 keval itnaa hi pratipaadit ho paaya he ki ve dhaatuen, jinke gun ek se hai, ek duusare ke saath sanyog nahin karti hai
 Since these types of alloys are hard, brittle, very less tensile and flexible, only a few of these are useful
 sab mishradhaatuon ko saadharantaya louh tathaa aloh mishradhaatuon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 When iron is the base metal in the alloy, then that iron and when the base metal is any other metal, then it is called non-ferrous alloy

 civil ejiniyari, vyavsaayik ejineering kii ek shakha he jo ki bhautik or prakritik rup se bane parivesh main pul, sadak,naharen, band or bhawanon aadi ke dizin, nirmaan or rakrakhaav se judi he
 Civil engineering is the oldest branch of engineering after military engineering
 ise sainya ejineering se alag karne ke liye 'asainik ejineering' ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya
 Traditionally, it has been divided into several sub-branches, which include - environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, municipal or urban engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering, surveying and construction engineering
 Civil engineering takes place at every level: from the municipal sector to the federal levels in the public sector and from private house owners to international companies in the private sector
 jab se maanav astitv main aayaa he tab se ejineering uski zindagi kaa ek hissaa he
 The beginning of civil engineering correctly can be traced back to the time when 4000 and 2000 BC
 In ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia humans began to abandon the lives of Banjaras

 Other ancient historical civil engineering works include the Parthenon built by Ictinos in ancient Greece, the Appian Way built by Roman engineers, and The Great Wall of China, built by General Meng Teen at the behest of China's Emperor Shih Huang Ti
 The Romans built urban structures throughout their empire, including - canals, chambers, ports, bridges, dams, and roads
 aadhunik kaal se pehle civil abhiyantriki or vaastukala,ke bich koi spasht antar nahin tha
 There was only a geographical difference between the words of both engineer and architect in which the same person was called an engineer at some places and the architect at some places, often the same person was sometimes called an engineer or sometimes an architect
 In the 18th century, the term began to be used to distinguish military engineering from civil engineering

 The institution received a royal manifesto in the year 1828 giving formal recognition to civil engineering
 iske ghoshnaptr ne civil abhiyantriki ko is rup main paribhaashit kiya ki The first private school to teach civil engineering in the United States was Norwich University, founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge
 1835 main renceceller politechnic institute dwaara sanyukt rajya america main civil abhiyantriki ki pehali degree di gayi
 Such a degree was given to a woman in 1905 by Cornell University to Nora Stainton Blach
 civil ejineering bhautik or vaigyanik siddhanton kaa anuprayog he or iskaa itihaas bhi bhautikee or ganit kii samaj main hone vaale vikaas ke puure itihaas se judaa he
 Because civil engineering is a wide-ranging business that includes many different and specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge in many fields such as structures, materials science, geography, soil and hydrology, environment, mechanics and more

 This degree usually requires four or five years of study
 is degree ko puraa karne ke baad saamanytah aapako par ek ejineering main snaatak, karnaa kaha jaataa he, haalanki kuch vishvavidhyalayon main ise vigyaan main snaatak karnaa kaha jaataa he is degree main aam taur par bhautik vigyaan, ganit, pariyojna prabandhan, dijaining or civil ejineering ke kuch vishisht vishay shaamil hote hai
 Initially, such subjects try to tell more and more subjects and if it is not possible to give complete information about that subject, then they tell about the subdivisions of civil engineering after the degree is completed
 Students can choose one or more subdivisions to do a special study in
 adhikansh deshon main, ejineering main snaatak kii degree ek peshewar pramanikaran kii disha main pehla kadam hota he or iskaa degree program swayan ek peshewar sanstha dwaara pramanit hota he
 After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must be qualified to obtain this degree before obtaining this certified degree
 Once certified, the engineer is given the title of Professional Engineer in which they are called Chartered or Authorized Engineers
 As a branch it covers hydrology, environmental science, meteorology, geology, conservation and resource management
 civil ejineering kaa yah kshetra bhumigat or dharti ke upar vaale sansadhano kii gunvattta or maatra donon kii bhavishyavaanee or prabandhan se juda hua he
 Water resources engineers make a model from the very small part of the land and analyze it so that they can estimate it by the flow of water
 However, the actual design of the facility can also be assigned to another engineer
 hydrolic yaa jaleey ejineering drav ke pravaah or vahan se sambandhit he
 It is mainly related to water
 civil ejineering kaa yah kshetra pipelinon ke dizin, jal vitaran pranali, jal nikasi or naharen shaamil hai 
 hydrolic yaa jaleey ejeeniyar in suvidhaon ko drav daab, drav taral padaarth kaa dabaav, drav sthitik, drav gatishiltaa or jalagati vigyaan, ke alaava anya dizin karte hai
 Another aspect of civil engineering is matter or metallurgy
 padaarth yaa dhaatu ejineering chini-mitti kii chijen jaise kancreet, thos mishrit daamer, aluminium or ispaat jaise dhaatu or bahulak jaise ki polimethailmethacrillate dhaatu kii badi hui shakti ke ird-gird aakrisht rahete hai
 Structural engineering is concerned with structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers, tunnels
 saath hi saath yah samudragami ilaakon main bani sanrachanaayen evam or anya sanrachanaon se sambandhit he
 It identifies the forces exerted on the structure and the pressures and stresses caused by these forces within that structure and then constructs the structure so that it can successfully lift and bear those forces
 Other dead force, living force, dynamic force, wind force, earthquake force, may be equal to the force generated by temperature change
 sanrachanaatmak ejiniyaron ko sanrachnaao ko is prakaar bananaa chahie ki unke prayog se prayog karne vaale ko koi haani ho or jis kaary ke liye uskaa nirmaan hua he, wo us kaary ko safaltaapurvak puraa kare 
 kuch bhaaran sthitiyon ki prakruti ke kaaran sanrachanaatmak ejineering ke bheetar kii up-shakhaaen viksit ho jaati hai, jisamen vaayu ejineering or bukamp ejineering shaamil hai
 The byproduct of the design includes the strength, rigidity and stability of the structure when carried for loads that may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, earthquake, congestion or vehicles
 Load, or temp such as temp, build load or impact
 Other considerations include cost, ability to manufacture, safety, aesthetics and stability
 surveykshan vah prakriya he jisamen surveykshak kuch ayaamon ko naapta he jo ki aamtaur par dharti kii sataha par hota he
 Survey instruments, such as squares and theodolite angular divergence, horizontal, vertical and slope distances are used for accurate measurements
 computarikaran ke saath, electronic duuri kii maap, kul stesan, jeepies surveykshan or lager scanning poorak ne paaramparik optical upkarnon ko anupoorak bana diya he 
 yah jaankaree prithvi kii sataha ke data ko chitramay praturup main ek nakshe ke rup main badalane main bahut mahatvapurn he
 After that this information is also given to civil engineers, contractors and even brokers so that they can use it to design, manufacture and trade respectively
 The elements of a building or structure need to be in the right shape and location with respect to each other and the correct position of boundaries and adjacent structures
 yadhyapi surveykshan alag yogyata or alag license vyavastha ke saath ek alag vyavsaay he
 Civil engineers are trained in surveying and mapping, basic and geographic information systems
 surveykshak railweymarg, tremave trek, rajmarg, sadak, pipelinon or galiyon ke nirmaan ke saath-saath kuch anya avasanrachanaon ke nirmaan se pehle unki sthit tay karte hai, jaise ki bandargah Land Survey sanyukt rajya america main, britain, canada or adhikansh rashtramandal deshon ke bhoomi surveykshan ko ek vishisht pesha mana jaataa he
 Land conservators are not considered engineers and have their own professional associations and their own licensing requirements
 ek license bhoomi kii sevaaon ko aam taur par seemaa ke surveykshan ke liye aavashyak hai 
 Construction survey nirmaan surveykshak aamtaur par vishesh takanisian dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Unlike land surveyors, its outcome plan does not have constitutional facility
 nirmaan surveykshak nimnlikhit kaary karata he: Transport engineering should be the driver of mass and goods efficiently, safe and lively for the people of society
 Transport engineering is related to these things
 is kaary main sammilit hai - ullikhit karnaa, dizin, nirmaan, parivahan kii buniyadi suvidhaon ko banaae rakhana jinamein shaamil hai sadaken, naharen, rajmarg, rail pranaliyaan, hawaii adde, bandargah, or jan pargamanisamen parivahan dizin, parivahan yojana, yatayaat ejineering, shahari ejineering, ke kuch pahalu, pankti siddhant, ] intellegent transportesan system or parivahan prabandhan jaise kshetra shaamil he Urban engineering is concerned with urban infrastructure
 isamen shaamil he ullekhan, digining, nirmaan or anurakshan karnaa
 jisamen sadak, pagadendi, jal aapurti network, naalee, street lit nagarpalika thos apshisht kaa prabandhan or nishpaadan, saarvajanik kaaryon or prabandhan ke liye kai dhaatuon ke liye bhandaran, saarvajanik park or cycle path kaa anurakshan karnaa shaamil he
 In the case of underground utility networks, it may also connect the civilian portion of the local distribution network of electricity and telecommunications services
 It also includes garbage collection and bus service network optimization
 inamen se kuch vishay kuch anya civil ejineering visheshtaon se ghulmil gaye hai, halaanki nagar nigam ejineering in buniyadi suvidhaon ke network or sevaaon par dhyaan kendrit rakhata he, jaisaa ki ye praayah kramshah banate hai or ek hi nagar nigam prashasan dwaara sanchalit kiye jate hai
 The power generated by the energy of falling or flowing water is called hydroelectricity
 san 2005 main vishwa bhar main lagbhag 816 gwe jalavidyut utpann kii jaati thi jo ki vishwa kii sampoorn vidyut urja kaa lagbhag 20% he
 This electricity is pollution free
 evam yah paryaavaran ke anukool he
 The economically exploitable and viable water potential in India is estimated at 84,000 MW at a 66 percent weight factor
 iske atirikt, chote, laghu tathaa sookshm jal vidyut yojanaon se sthapit kshamta ke 6780 megawatt kaa aankalan kiya gaya he
 56 sites have also been identified for pumped storage schemes with accumulated installed capacity of 94,000 MW
 tathaapi, abhi tak is sambhavyata ke keval 19
9 pratshit kaa hi dohan kiya ja sakaa he
 Electricity is the hydroelectric power obtained from water generated by water
 vidyut shakti ke janan kii vidhiyon main jalavidyut bahut mahatvapurn hai
 One-third of the entire electric power of the world is received in the form of hydroelectricity
 yon to kisi bhi rup main uplabdh urja ko vidyutshakti ke janan ke liye prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 The energy contained in the water falling in the waterfall has been used since ancient times to run the watermill, but the use of this energy for electric power has been given from the twentieth century itself
 na keval girte hue jal main nihit urja kaa upyog shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, varan behate hue pani main nihit gatij urja kaa upyog bhi shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, the first is to choose a place where the dam can be stored in plenty of water and the power contained therein can be used to generate electricity for power generation by using canals or open canals in power stations
 upyukt sthaan kii talash ke liye varsha tathaa jameen donon kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 The dam is built in such a place where the dam made in the lowest price can store maximum water
 iske liye sthaan kii prakritik dasha aisi honi chahie ki koi nadi ghati main hoti hui pahaado ke bich sankare maarg se guzarati ho, jisase sakare sthaan par band banaakar nadi ke upree bhaag ko ek bade jalashay main parivartit kiya ja sake
 Another agar is built above the dam, from where the water is carried by open canals or taps to the power house
 yah pani bijlighar main sthit bade bade tarabinon ko chalaata he, jinase yojit janitron main vidyut shakti kaa janan hota he
 The turbine is located on the face of the draft tube made of cement concrete
 pani guide wain main hota hua tarabine ke bladon ko ghumata he or is prakaar apane nihit urja kaa tarabine ke chalaane main upyog karata he
 The mechanical energy of the moving turbine is converted into electrical energy and thus the energy contained in water takes the form of hydroelectricity
 tarabine main is prakaar pani main nihit shakti kaa upyog ho jane ke pashchaat, pani draft-tub main se hota hua visarjani kulya main jaataa he, jahaan se vah phir nadi main ja miltaa he
 The design of the draft-tube is such that the remaining energy of the water is slowly depleted, so that it does not damage the river banks when it comes out
 pani main nihit urja, uske aaytan tathaa sheersh par nirbhar karti he
 Hydropower schemes can be divided into three parts according to the head: 1
 ucch sheersh yojana - lagbhag 200 meter se adhik
 2
 Medium Head Plan - 50 meters to 200 meters
 3
 nimna sheersh yojana - 50 meter se kam
 Both the size and the shape of the plan depends on the top and also the type of its turbines accordingly
 is prakaar ucch sheersh ke liye francis tarabine evam paston chakra upyukt hote hai
 Pressurized turbines are used for the middle head
 nimna sheersh ke liye nodak praroop kaa tarabine adhik upyukt hota he
 In high-end schemes, generally, the volume of water is not high
 isliye pani ko nalon dwaara le jaakar tarabine ke tund se ranor kii waltiyon par choda jaataa he, jisase pani main nihit urja ranor ko chalaane main samarth hoti he
 The turbine can control the output of the turbine by controlling the flow and speed of the water and by varying the angle of water released on the buckets and thus control the power generated
 baltiyon ke kone kaa vicharan karnaa bhi sambhav he or donon niyantranon ko swat: chaalit rup se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The propellant turbine runner has only three or four wings
 ye baari ispaat ke bane hote hai
 Low head plans often have a very high water volume
 at: inamen pani ko nalon main le janaa sambhav nahin hota or khuli naalee kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 To obtain the output corresponding to the load, it is necessary to vary the amount of water going into the turbine, which is edited by opening the door
 ye dwaar guide pichhafalak kii bhanti hote hai or inaki sthiti pani kaa niyantran karti he
 Being heavy, these gates are driven by hydraulic pressure
 jis prakaar peltan chakra ke guide pichhafalak, athwa baltiyon, ke kone kaa vicharan kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar inhen bhi swat: chaalit rup se pravartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The automatic driven variance is performed by the servo motor
 yah chota sa motor hota he, jo dravchaalit daabak kaa vicharan karata he
 Its investment is only a fraction of the output of the turbine, so it varies accordingly
 is prakaar is motor dwaara kiya gaya kaary tarabine ke nirgat par, jo uske upar bhaar ke anuroop hota he, nirbhar karata he or swat: chaalit rup se dravchaalit daabak ko gata badhaakar usee ke anusaar guide pichhafalak, athwa dwaara khulaai, kaa niyantran kar detaa he, athwa baltiyon ke kone kaa vyavasthaapan kar detaa he
 Propellant type turbine is the main one in propellant type turbine
 isaki visheshta isaki majboot or ucch dakshata he
 Another feature of this is that the load variance has very little effect on efficiency, due to which this turbine is very suitable for variable loads
 madhyam sheersh yojanaon main, saamanyat:, mishrit pravaahavala tarabine adhik prayukt hota he, parantu sheersh ke anuroop hi uskaa chayan adhik nirbhar karata he
 Steady guide lanes are used to move water to the turbine
 iske nirgat kaa vicharan unke kone ke vicharan se kiya jaataa he
 a low-heading turbine is usually located above the open shafts
 ye sarpil praroop ke aavaran se ghire hote hai, jisase pani ko ek samaan rup se guide pichhafalak dwaara le jaaya ja sake
 In high-powered turbines, this cover is made of metal
 tarabine kshaitij evam urdhwadhar donon prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 But in general, vertical is more used
 inamen bering vishisht prakaar kaa hota he, jise mashin par pratishthit parshv aghat bhi vahan karnaa hota he
 Hence these are called shock wearings
 vering tathaa duusare gatiman bhaagon kaa snehan bhi apane-aap main ek kathin samasya hoti he
 Pressure lubrication method is used for this
 isamen snehak tel ko dabaakar snehan kiye janevaale sthanon main bheja jaataa he
 Pressure is generated by the oil pump
 daab ghat jane par, mashin ke apane aap band ho jane kii vyavastha bhi hoti he, jisase aisi paristhiti main use kshati na pahunche
 There is an oil filter to clean the lubricating oil and there is also an oil cooler to cool the oil that gets heated after lubrication
 jalavidyut yojanaon main sabase adhik mahatv unki sthiti kaa he
 Their condition depends mainly on natural and physical causes
 mote taur par kisi jalavidyut yojana se 1,000 ghan foot prati second ke pravaah se 150 foot kaa sheersh uplabdh hone par lagbhag 10 megawatt kii shakti uplabdh hogi
 The reservoir can also be estimated on the basis that 1 foot of water over an area of 1
13 square miles generates a flow of only 1 cubic foot per second
 at: 1,000 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah paane ke liye jalashay main 113 varg mile ke kshetrafal main ausat se 10 foot gaharaa pani hona chahie
 For any hydroelectric scheme to be practical, it is necessary to have maximum head and flow
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen tabhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati hai, jab pani kaa pravaah paryaapt ho
 High-top schemes can be practical even at low flows
 bijlighar kii sthiti band ke nikat hona anivaary nahin he
 The reservoir can be on the mountain and the powerhouse can be built at the foot of the mountain to get to the top
 aisi dasha main pani kii badi badi nalikaaon dwaara bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Plans with higher heads are usually of this type
 bahut se sthanon par pahari ko katkar surang ke dwaara pani ko pahari ke duusari or bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 It is not compulsory for the power house to be on earth

 a similar underground power plant has been built in Maithon
 aise bijli ghar swachaalit praroop ke haate hai or duurastha niyantran dwaara prithvital se chaalit hote hai
 Although these power plants are built mainly inside the earth due to natural reasons, they are very important from a strategic point of view

 Many power stations have been built over the Ganges and Sharda canals, in which only the top of 20 to 30 feet is used

 Their main drawback is actually their distance from consumer locations
 ye yojanaayen jahaan chahen vahaan ke liye nahin banaai ja saktin
 For example, if the demand for power is in Calcutta, it is not possible to implement the hydroelectric scheme there
 himalay se nikalanevaali nadiyon main apaar jalashakti nihit he, parantu vahaan shakti kii maang nahin he
 In this way, the power generated by the hydroelectric scheme often has to be transmitted to great distances
 at:, jalavidyut yojana kaa saapeksh rup se adhyayan karne ke liye preshnatantr kaa vyay bhi lagaana aavashyak he
 Even then, hydroelectricity is mostly cheap
