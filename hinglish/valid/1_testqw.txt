 The report has made several appropriate recommendations for starting small experimental projects and measuring their results, whose list is quite long
 client said / web brouzar praudyogikiyaan jo Web 2
0 main prayukt hoti hai - Asynchronous javascript or XML, Adobe Flash or javascript / Ajax Fremwork jaise ki Yahoo! UI Library, Dojo Toolkit, mootools or jquery
 Ajax programing web sarwar se ek puraa prishth punah lod kiye bina, nayaa data aplod or downlod karne ke liye javascript kaa prayog karti he
 To allow the user to work on the page, communications from the server such as data requests are separated from the data returning to the page
 
 anyathaa, upyogkarta ko us pej par kuch bhi karne se pehle niyamit rup se data ke vaapis tak pratiksha kerani padegi, jis prakaar upyogkarta ek pej ko punah lod karne ke liye pratiksha karata he
 This also increases the overall performance of the site, as faster requests can be sent and data can be sent to the customer without interruptions or lines
 Ajax anurodh dwaara liya gaya data aamtaur par XML yaa JSON, do vyapak rup se prayukt hone vaale sanrachit data swaroop hai, ke rup main formet hota he
 Since javascript can be easily understood by both of these formats, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data to their web program
 jab yah data Ajax dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he, to javascript program document object model kaa prayog karke naye data ke aadhaar par web pej ko swachaalit dhang se apadet kar detaa he, jisase ek teevr tathaa parsparik kriyaatmak prayokta kaa anubhav miltaa he
 In short, using these techniques, web designers can create their own pages to function as desktop programs

 In order to share your data with other sites, a web site must be able to generate machine-readable formats, such as XML, RSS, and JSON
 When data from one site is available in one of these formats, the other website can integrate the functionality of a part of that site by connecting both

 The reader of a blog or wiki is provided with the tools by which he can post his comments in the blog or edit the content in case of wiki

 But perhaps the most common criticism is that the word is ambiguous or merely a slogan

 In terms of the social impact of Web 2

0 has created a group of digital narcissists and hobbyists, including inappropriate opinions - any of their opinions and content about any of their topics
 The type looks at the concept of expertise by allowing anyone, anywhere, to share it, regardless of their particular talent, knowledge, identity, bias, or potential hidden plan

 kuch vidwaanon ne hathiyaaron ke nimnlikhit 3 lakshan bataaye hai- The famous military thinker JFC Fuller has said that weapons have the following characteristics: uparokt gunon ke saath-saath uttam hathiyaaron main nimnlikhit gunon kaa hona bhi atyant aavashyak hota he- Protection of various body parts has been noted
 udaahranarth sharir ke liye charm tathaa kavach kaa, sir ke liye shiristraan or gale ke liye kanthatran ityadi kaa
 Similar weapons were also manufactured in Europe
 12veen sadi kaa kavach lohe kii choti-choti kadiyon ko goonthkar banataa tha
 Zirhabkhtar was beautiful and convenient, but could not fully protect it from heavy weapon injuries
 isliye 13veen sadi i
 se europe main lohe kii chadar ke aavaran banane lage or unhen jalika ke upar pahana jane laga
 The warrior was now covered with plaque from head to toe
 sharir ke avyavon ke saral andolan ke liye in kavchon main jod bane rahete the
 The same armor was also made for the rear horse
 jalika bhi ashv tathaa manushya donon ke liye banati thi
 The armor of the rider and horsemen ranged from 200 to 300 pounds
 13veen shatabdi main shastron kii shakti main bhi unnati hui
 The long bow of the British was so powerful that the arrow made from it pierced ordinary armor
 yah dhanush chah foot lanbaa hota tha or iskaa chah foot kaa baan 250 gaj tak sugamawa se maar kar saktaa tha
 Similarly, there was the 'halberd ax' of Switzerland
 iskaa dasta aath foot kaa tha or kulhaade ke saath-saath isamen barchhi or savaar ko khinchakar giraane ke kaam kaa ek tedha kaanta bhi hota tha
 a skilled fighter could also cut good armor from its injury
 barood ke avishkaar ne manushya ke haath main ek aisi shakti de di jisane yuddh kii ruparekha hi badal di
 It is certain that firearms were manufactured in the early 14th century
 pratham aagneyastra top thi
 It is mainly made of two types - one is short nalwali and the other is long drain
 ye topein pehle taanbe or kaanse kii baniin or phir lohe kii banane lageen
 In the 15th century, the cannons were 30 inches in circumference and fired stone shells weighing between 1,200 and 1,500 pounds
 aadhunik havitzar or baari fildgan moreter or bambard ke hi viksit rup hai
 By the end of this century small hand guns were made
 inkaa sthaan 15veen shatabdi ke aarambh main haath kii bandook ne liya
 This gradually evolved into musket, matchlock, flintlock and modern rifle
 teevr gati se lagaataar goli chalaanevaali bandook banane kii cheshtaa or is sambandh ke prayog 16veen shatabdi se hone lage the or isi ke falswaroop 1884 main pratham safal mashinagan bani
 Today's machine guns can fire up to several hundred tablets in a minute
 anya mahatvapurn shastron kaa bhi avishkaar 14veen se 16veen shatabdi main hua, jaise haath kaa bam, kaanse ke visphotak gole, pistaul, daahak gole, ityadi
 Arms were more developed in modern times
 16veen shatabdi tak aagneyastra itane prabhaavshaalee ban chuke the ki manushya ke swarakshatmak kavach vyarth the
 The man of 1915 remained helpless in front of firearms, but the first armor was built this year
 manushya ab ispaat kii moti-moti chaadaron se bani is gaadi main baithkar halke aagneyastra ke prahaar se batch saktaa tha
 The principle of working of gun, rifle and cannon is the same
 kisi teen ore dridhtaa se band paatr main barood rakhi jaati he or iske baad chharra, goli yaa gola rakhkar chauthi ore se paatr ko asthaayee rup se band kar diya jaataa he
 The gunpowder is then set on fire with a device
 tab barood turant jalakar gaison main parivartit ho jaati he
 These gases are highly compressed due to being generated in very less space
 isliye chharen, goli yaa gole ko ve bahut balpurvak dabaati hai
 As long as the sphere moves in the placenta of the device, it keeps pressing on it and its velocity keeps increasing
 is prakaar usamen bahut adhik veg utpann ho jaataa he
 Due to the placenta, its direction is also determined; Therefore, by moving the placenta, the sphere can be hit at the target at will
 san 1313 i
 se europe main top ke prayog kaa pakkaa pramaan miltaa he
 In India, Babur first used cannons in the battle of Panipat
 pehle topein kaanse kii banati thim or unako dhaala jaataa tha
 But such guns were not sufficiently athletic
 unamem adhik barood daalane se ve fat jaati thim
 To overcome this flaw, iron rings were heated and put on them very tightly
 thandha hone par aise challe sikudakar badi dridhtaa se bhitari naal ko dabaae rahete hai, thik usee prakaar jaise baiylgaadee ke pahie ke upar chadhi haal pahie ko dabaae rahati he
 For greater confirmation, the rods were also placed along the length of the rod along each other before mounting the rings
 is samay kii ek prasiddh top mons meg he, jo ab edinbura ke durg par shobhaa ke liye rakhi he
 After this, there was no significant advance in cannon making for about 200 years
 is yug main naalon kaa sanchhidr chikna hota tha
 But in about 1520 a German cannon maker started making spiral grooves in the fringes
 is top main golakaar gole ke badale lambotar "gole" prayukt hote the
 Due to the spiral grooves in the compound, the projecting body starts dancing with velocity
 is prakaar naachata pind vaayu ke pratirodh se bahut kam vichlit hota he or parinamswaroop lakshya par adhik sachai se padataa he
 In 1855, Lord Armstrong built a wrought iron cannon, in which all this material was removed by removing the lid from the back, instead of loading ammo from the mouth like earlier cannons
 isamen 40 pound ke prakshipt bhare jate the
 In ordinary cannons, the projectile comes out at great speed and the cannon can not be moved in a very high direction
 duusari ore choti naal kii topein halki banati hai or unase nikle prakshipt main bahut veg nahin hota, parantu inamen yah gun hota he ki prakshipt bahut upar uthakar neeche girtaa he or isliye isse diwaar, pahari aadi ke peeche chhipe shatru ko bhi maar sakate hai
 These are called mortars
 majholi naap kii nalwali top ko houvitzar kehete hai
 As the cannon making progressed, so too did the advancements in the making of mortars and howitzers
 praaia: sabhi deshon main ek hi prakaar se topon ke nirmaan main unnati hui, kyonki baraabar hode lagi rahati thi
 When one country makes more heavy, more powerful or more quick-fire cannons, the matter is not hidden for many days and the rival countries would have tried to make even better guns
 1898 i
 main fransavaalon ne ek aisi top banaai jo uske baad bananevaali topon kii pathpradarshak hui
 The velocity of the projectile was higher than that; His attribution was commendable; The firing was completely stable, because in the implantation there were grains which did not allow the cannon to move in any direction by getting stuck in the ground
 sabhi topein daagne par peeche hatati hai
 Fluids were used to reduce the velocity of this attack
 iske prakshipt patali diwaar ke banaae the
 Each of these weights was about 12 pounds and contained about three and a half pounds of high explosive ammo
 prakshipt main vishesh rasayanon se yukt ek topi bhi rahati thi, jisase lakshya par pahunchakar prakshipt fat jaataa tha or tukade bade veg se idhar-udhar shatru ko dur tak ghayal karte the
 It can also kill soldiers hiding behind a wall
 pratham vishwayuddh main germanon ne 'big bartha' naamak top banaai, jisase unhone paris par 75 mile kii duuri se gole barsaanaa aarambh kiya
 There was no new theory in this cannon
 top keval paryaapt badi or pusht thi
 But with the invention of airplanes and other new instruments such guns have now become endangered
 agnibaan usee siddhant par chalate hai jisapar deepawali par chode janevaale barood bhare baan
 In the final year of the Second World War, firefighters proved very effective
 agnibanprekshepak main 30 agnibaan teen-teen inch vyas ke lage rahete the or prayek main cordit naamak visphotak bharaa rahata tha
 The weight of each head was 29 pounds
 daagne par prayek agnibaan 3,900 se 8,000 gaj tak ja saktaa tha
 Each electrical switch was fired
 in swichon ko yaa to is prakaar vyavasthit kiya ja saktaa tha ki agnibaan aadh-aadh second par apane aap chhutate rahen yaa icchaanusaar kai agnibaan yaa kul agnibaan ek saath hi chhuten
 This sudden blast of high explosive caused heavy damage to the enemy's army and made him extremely afraid
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke ant main germany ne bina maanvi sanchaalak ke or bahut dur tak pahunchnewale agnibaan banaae, jinka naam ve-es or ve-do padaa
 Visually the V-1 was like an aircraft
 isamen 130 galen petrol aata tha or mashin kaa bhaar lagbhag ek ton rahata tha
 Its velocity used to be 350 miles per hour while flying and it produced terrible sounds while walking
 saath main ve-do kaa chitra dikhaaya gaya he
 Alcohol and liquid oxygen were used in this
 prayek baan main lagbhag teen ton alcohol or paanch ton drav oxygen bharaa rahata tha
 Its maximum velocity was about 3,000 miles per hour
 yantra kii akruti cigar kii tarah hoti thi or bina eendhan bhaar lagbhag ek ton
 Airplanes move at such a speed that it was difficult to shoot them with a cannon, but American scientists added such a connection between radars and airborne cannons that the cannon itself was fixed on the aircraft

 They have proved more terrible than atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs
 ye aise astr hai jinhen chhodane par kisi prakaar kaa dhamaakaa nahin hota he
 Bacterial weapons contain disease-causing bacteria and the war in which they are used is very dangerous and destructive
 pratham vishwayuddh main yubhumi main 51,259 amareeki sainik mare the, par uske baad jeevanuon se faili beemaari se maranevaalon kii sankhya 51,447 thi
 In ancient times people used to put the dead body of the patient in the circle of enemies so that their death could be caused by bacteria
 ye yuddh main astron ke rup main prayukt kiye jate hai or kai prakaar ke hote hai
 They spread infectious diseases to humans, animals and plants
 inkaa prayog dushman kii yuddh karne kii kshamta ghataane ke liye hota he
 These bacteria infect millions of soldiers in a very short time on getting the proper environment
 yuddhastra ke rup main naanaa prakaar ke jeevanu prayog main laae jate hai or prayek prakaar ke jeevanu alag-alag prakaar ke sankramak rog failaate hai
 Among the various tools that are possible to use for disease-causing bacteria are some of the following: ek baar chhod die jane par ye sookshmjivi hawa main bikhar jate hai or vaayu ke saath-saath hajaaron mile ke kshetra main fail jate hai
 For example, if Basilai is released by aerosol at a distance of 240 km from the beach, it will automatically spread over an area of 1,30,800 square km
 is prakaar us bhubhag main ye jeevanu rog failaate hai
 It has been found that the number of soldiers who die due to infection with these microbes is more than the soldiers who die from the attack of weapons
 jeevanuon ke prajnan kii jo aseem kshamta he vah jeevanu astron ko or adhik ghaatak bana detii he
 If these bacteria go once, then it is not easy to destroy them
 in jeevanuon kaa koi vishesh rang, swaad or gandh nahin hota
 Due to these characteristics, the importance of bacterial weapons is increasing day by day

 It is a lunar-time observer, which has twelve months in a year, and 354 or 355 days

 sabhyataa ke prarambh se hi darshan vidyavan logon ke bich vishesh abhiruchi kaa vishay rahaa he
 Since the time of the Vedas and Upanishads in India, the knowledge of philosophical curiosity and philosophical thinking was prevalent among inquisitive scholars and intellectuals
 udhaaharan ke liye rugveda main jahaan-tahaan sristi ke prarambh, drishyman jagat ke upadan dravya evam rachayita aadi ke sambandh main kaavyatmak dhang se prashn uthaaye gayi
 The famous Narada Sukta is the best example of the questionability and curiosity of this category
 yahan dhyatavya he ki rugveda bhashabaddh sahitya kaa praayah sabase pracheen udhaaharan he
 The composition of the Rigveda is usually from 3000 to 1500 BC
 Is considered to be between pracheenatam upanishad isa ke aathvin shatee purv kii rachanaayen maane jate hai
 In them, curiosity related to the appearance of the soul is everywhere
 kahana nahin hoga ki bharatvarsh main ghatit baad ke darshanon ke vikaas par upanishdon kaa vyapak or gambheer prabhaav padaa
 It is worth noting that in the history of philosophy, there have been changes in its definition, form and concept of its major problems
 pracheen kaal main darshanik chintan ke do pramukh kendra bane, ek bharat or doosraa yunaan
 In both these areas, philosophy was defined or conceptualized as metaphysics or metaphysics
 yahan gyatavya he ki pracheen kaal main vigyaanon kaa, bhautik vigyaan kaa bhi, udai nahin ho sakaa tha
 As a result, all questions related to world-world and life were contained in the philosophy
 pracheen yunaan main theliz jaise vichaarkon ne yah prashn poocha ki drishyman jagat kaa mul upadan dravya kya he
 Different philosophers gave different answers to the said question
 pracheen kaal main aadhunik qism kii prayog-vidhiyon kaa avishkaar nahin hua tha, na doorveekshan tathaa anuvikshan jaise yantron kaa hi
 In that era, the source of knowledge was the senses, etc
, and to some extent the guessing intellect
 indriyon ke anubhav ke alok main yunaan or apane desh main bhi yah kalpana kii gayi ki gochar vastuon kaa upadan kaaran paanch yaa chaar mahabhoot hai
 The early thinkers of Greece declared one or the other element as the basic element of water, wind, fire, whereas in India, the Vaishya Vesic philosophies accepted the original elements of the five elements
 upanishdon main mahabhuton kaa sthaan aatma yaa brahm ne le liya or darshan kaa vishay aatma ke swaroop kaa nirdhaaran ban gaya
 The essence of the world is Brahma or Atma and the purpose of philosophy is the editing of the knowledge of the said soul
 is prakaar darshan ko tatvagyan ke rup main prakalpit kiya gaya
 It is important to note here that where there are many theorems in nyaya-vaisesika philosophies, the only known element in the systems of thought called Vedanta is Atma or Brahma
 to, pracheenon ke anusaar darshan tatvagyan he or atmagyaan yaa aatmanveshan
 The second major branch of philosophy is Gyanamimamsa, which considers the form and means of knowledge
 bharatvarsh main is shakha kaa sabase adhik vikaas nyaayadarshan main hua, jisane pratyaksh, anumaan aadi pramaanon ko, arthath unke swaroop-nirdhaaran ko, chintan kaa khaas vishay banaaya
 After the outside of the twentieth century, after the introduction of the so-called Navyanya, the Nyayadarshana became fully subsumed in the epistemology
 aaj darshan kii ukt paribhaasha, yah ki darshan tatvagyan yaa tatvamimasaa he, sweekaarya nahin rah gayi he
 There are many forms of what we call elements
 vishwa-jagat main pradhanta bhautik tatv yaa tatwon kii he
 Our earth, solar system and numerous asteroids are composed of physical elements; The same thing is applicable to our body and senses as well
 aatma kii satta aaj bhi sandigdh bani hui he
 But various physical sciences are studied by the body and the diverse forms and physical elements of the physical world
 aaj vaisheshik darshan dwaara di gayi jal, vaayu, agni aadi kii paribhaashaayen praarambhik jaan padati hai
 Ancient Greek thinkers and Maharishi Kanad were not aware that what we call air or water is not a chemical element, but a mixture or compound of multiple elements
 dhyaan dene kii baat yah he ki yadi ham veydant ke is siddhanth ko maanakar na chalem ki vishwa kaa multatva aatma yaa brahm he, to yah sweekaar karne kaa koi kaaran nahin rah jaataa ki darshan kaa vishay vishwa kaa mul tatva he
 The fundamental element of the world can also be atoms of one or several categories and negative and positive electrons or electric waves or magnetic fields or and electric fields
 nishchay hi darshan in tattvon kaa adhyayan nahin kar saktaa
 Another thing comes from the history of philosophy
 kaha gaya he ki ‘munde-munde matirbhinna’ or yah ki ‘naco muniryasy vachah pramanm’ taatpary yah he ki vibhinn darshanik vichaarkon ne alag-alag mat pratipaadit kiye hai
 In ancient times, six believers and as many atheists appeared in their country
 baad main veydant kahe jane vaale darshan ke antargat bhi lagbhag utane hi sampradaay ban gayi, shaiva-shakt darshan alag bane
 If we look to the west, there have been several dozen philosophical sects, starting from ancient Greek thinkers there
 yah sthiti hone ke kaaran darshan ke itihaas main kai baar yah prashn uthaaya gaya ki darshanikon ke bich aise bhayankar matbhed kyon hote hai
 
 aadhunik europea darshan ke janmdata france ke darshanik dekart ne ukt prashn se ulajhate hue yah pratipaadit kiya ki darshan ko ganit kii paddati apnaani chahie jahaan sanshay-andeh kii koi gunjaaish nahin rahati
 This question has also been raised many times later in the philosophical-history of the West
 iskaa pramukh kaaran vigyaan kii nirantar ghatit hoti hui pragati, jisane aaj kii abhootpurv audyogic unnati evam takneekee safaltaaon ko sambhav banaaya he, rahi he
 The thinkers of Europe have given various suggestions, considering the question of why differences persist in the field of philosophy and why there is no progress of science there
 is sandarbh main yahan prasiddh darshanik bartrand rasel kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 In front of the department or branch of philosophy, which is called Tattva-epistemology, the so-called rational empiricists and sentimentalists put a special sharp and serious or dangerous question mark
 yah sarvavidit he ki vaigyanik mantavyon kii pariksha-indriya anubhav main uplabdh arthath gochar tathyon kii kasuti par kii jaati he
 The situation is that it is not possible to test the majority of statements or statements of the traditional metaphysics
 yahi kaaran hai ki tatva-mimasaa ke siddhanth aisi atakalbaajiyon kaa rup le lete hai, jinka gochar tathyon se sambandh nahin jud paata
 This is the main reason that ancient imaginative philosophies refute each other and cannot agree on any issue
 hamaari vishwa-sambandhi avadharanaon kaa sahi aadhaar vaigyanik anusandhan evam siddhanth hi ho sakate hai
 Needless to say that the importance of scientific investigation system is evidenced by the technological and technological progress made by its successes
 tarkanishtha anubhavvaadiyon ne paramparaagat darshan kii aalochana karte hue use aghat denevaali sabase adhik tikshn baat yah kahi ki tatva-mimasaa ke kathan na keval sahi hote hai, apitu nirarthak hote hai
 Meaningful statements are only those that can be inspected on the basis of visible facts
 chunki paramparit tatva-mimasaa ke vaktavy gochar anubhav yaa indriyagyaan dwaara pareekshaneey nahin hote-jaise ki vigyaan ke kathan hote hai - isliye ve arthhin maane jane chahie
 This means that the system that science uses to test its intentions can give reliable knowledge
 darshan vaigyanik anveshan-pranali kaa aashray nahin letaa, isliye uski pragati hoti nahin dikhaai detii or vah nirantar matbhedon kaa kreedakshetra bana rahata he
 The conclusion is that no intention of philosophy can be definitive
 upar hamane tarkanishtha anubhavvaadiyon kaa darshanavirohi mantavy prastut kiya he
 According to him, the statement that 'god is the doer of the world' or 'after death the soul goes to heaven or hell' can be said to be neither right nor wrong, it is indeed meaningless
 yahan ek ajeeb sthiti saamne aati he
 The stated intention of rational empiricists is a kind of philosophical scholasticism, not scientific
 sarthak kathan kii yah paribhaasha or kasuti ki vah indriyabodh dwaara pareekshaneey ho, swayan apane par lagu nahin hoti; ukt kasuti yaa paribhaasha kisi gochar tathy dwaara satyapneey yaa pareekshaneey nahin he
 In fact, it is just a proposal
 yah prastaav hamen ruchikar lagata he to isliye ki aaj ham vigyaan kii safalataa se nitant abhibhoot mahasoos karte hai
 Science is the biggest concern and miracle of today's era
 vah darshan par haaavee he
 It is important to note that in the West, a new branch of philosophy called Vigyan Darshan has been formed, which is being pursued specifically
 tathy yah he ki kisi bhi desh yaa yug kaa darshan samskruti ke us kshetra yaa un kshetron ko apana vishay banaata he jo us desh yaa yug ke logon ko mahatvapurn jaan padate hai
 For example, in the ancient times of our country, salvation was the biggest concern of the thinkers of wisdom
 faltah yahan moksh ke sambandh main nitant gambheer or vividh chintan hua
 Sankhya and Vedanta flourished one concept of salvation, Jainas and Buddhists ascribed other concepts
 ukt teenon ke anusaar kisi-na-kisi rup main jeev-mukti sambhav he, jabaki ramanuj aadi bhakt darshanikon ke mat main waisi mukti sambhav nahin he
 In the same way, many opinions about the means of salvation were proposed and many paths were recommended - such as Gyan Marg, Karm Marg, Bhakti Marg, Yog Marg and various tantric practices
 raajnneeti ke kshetra main hamaare desh main praayah rajtantr chalaa
 Republics developed mainly in Greece
 faltah vahaan ke darshanikon ne rajya ke swaroop or aadarshon par anekavidh chintan kiya
 Many political ideologies such as democracy, socialism, communism, etc
 were also presented in the present Europe
 pashchimi deshon main unaniyon ke samay se hi nitishastra ek mahatvapurn darshanik anushaasan rahaa he
 The philosophers of their country took so much interest in salvation philosophy that they did not give importance to morality and state-related questions
 kartavyakartavya, rajya aadi ke sambandh main sochane kaa bhaar smritikaron par daal diya gaya, jo chintan evam vimarsh kii apeksha upadesh hi adhik karte rahe
 Above we mentioned rational empiricism
 tatva-darshan kaa niraakaran karte hue ukt vaad ke samarthakon ne darshan ko punah paribhaashit kiya
 According to him, the function of philosophy is affirmative analysis
 darshan vibhinn pratyayon evam vaakyon yaa prakathanon kaa vishleshan is drushti se karata he ki unka indriya anubhav athwa gochar jagat se sambandh spasht kiya jaye
 The statement, which cannot be related to the visible world, should be doubted about whether it is meaningful or not
 usee prakaar vibhinn duusare sampratyayon kaa bhi vishleshan hona chahie
 In practice, rational empiricists focused their attention primarily on science suffixes and statements
 unke mat main nitishastra, dharm aadi ke kshetron se sambandhit kathan anubhav-jagat se sambandh na rakhane ke kaaran darshanik vishleshan kaa vishay nahin hote; darshan vaise kathanon kii nirarthakta hi sanketit kar saktaa he
 By the end of the Second World War, rational empiricalism itself was dispelled
 vichaarkon ne yah paaya ki jahaan ek ore ukt siddhanth aantarik visangatiyon se peedit he, vahiin duusari ore vah hamaare naitik nirnyon ke bare main koi pramanik kathan karne main hichakataa he
 a philosophy that ignores the moral and spiritual needs and experiences of mankind, in the course of time, discredits itself
 yah kahana kaafii nahin ki hamaare naitikta-sambandhi kathan andriyabodh dwaara satyapneey yaa pareekshaneey nahin hai or isliye nirarthak hai
 a man cannot live a meaningful life without morality
 yahi baat aadhyatmik tathaa soundaryaparak mulyon par lagu hoti he
 In fact, philosophy cannot ignore life-values
 uski drushti main vaigyanik bodh bhi ek prakaar kaa mulya he, kintu vah bodh ekmaatr mulya nahin he
 Explanation of the concepts is also not a simple business
 tarkanishtha anubhavvaad ke viruddh iglannd ke oxford vishvavidhyalay main ek anya darshanik sampradaay kaa udai hua jo pratyayon aadi ke vishleshnatmak bodh ke liye bolchaal kii bhashaa kaa aashray letaa he
 It is not intended to give details of these various philosophical sects here
 is sandarbh main ham do ek apekshit baaten kahkar aage badhenge
 We believe that the analysis of any suffix or concept requires a specific purpose or vision
 hamaari manyata he ki darshan kii vishesh drushti mulya-parak hoti or honi chahie
 For example, we analyze the suffix of causality in such a way that we can accurately assess its usefulness and importance in the ritual of enlightenment
 kisi kathan ke thik abhipraay kaa nishchay, jo vishleshan dwaara sambhav hota he, yah jaanane ke liye kiya jaataa he ki vah kathan kahan tak yatharth yaa vaastaviktaa ko pakadta yaa pakad paata he
 Scientific perception is also analyzed in this way - that is, to determine its truth or truth in relation to reality
 jise ham vigyaan-darshan kehete hai uskaa, darshan kii nijee drushti main yahi upyog he ki vah vaigyanik shodh ke swaroop or simaaon kii samuchit avgati yaa jaankaree de
 In this way, we can say that the main function of philosophy is the critical progression of perceptions or experiences of different categories
 yahan yaad rakhana chahie ki darshan usee anubhav kaa vichaar kar saktaa he jo bhashabaddh kiya ja chukaa he, arthath prakathanon ke rup main prakat ho chukaa he
 But the philosophy of science, which reviews scientific understanding, is not merely a science of science
 darshan kaa uddeshy saakshaat rup main vaigyanik anveshanon ko agrasar karnaa bhi nahin he
 This means that the science of philosophy, called philosophy, is not full
 mana ja saktaa he ki vaigyanik anveshan mahatvapurn vastu he, aaj ke yug main yah baat swayan siddh jaan padati he
 But this does not mean that in the present era other values of life and their exploration are not important
 ham jaanate hai ki kavy, kala, sangeet tathaa naitikta maanav-jivan ke liye sadaa se mahatvapurn rahe hai or aage bhi rahenge
 Philosophy considers the nature of all our values, which give qualitative rise to human and life
 ham maanate hai ki vaigyanik shodh evam chintan bhi keval vyaavhaarik drushti se upyogi nahin hai, ve maanav buddhi yaa mastishk ko gunatmak vaishishty bhi pradaan karte hai
 In fact, it is a matter of philosophy that every action, which is not only for utility but also gives qualitative excellence to human personality
 upyogi kriyaayein dhan-sampatti tathaa shakti ke liye anushthit hoti hai
 They mainly affect the physical and biological life of humans, they are beneficial only for the confirmation of certain emotions
 kintu ve vyaktitv kaa gunatmak vikaas karti hai, isamen sandeh he
 The same development of our personality takes place through the editing of knowledge, moral deeds and poetic literature and arts tastelessly
 ham maanate hai ki darshan kaa kaary un sab maanviya kriyaaon kii samikshit chetana he, jinka lakshya gunatmak utkarsh kii prapti he-athwa aise anand kii prapti jo vyaktitv kii gunatmak urdhv gati se sahcharit rahata he
 Especially poetic literature and practice of various disciplines are the actions of the said category
 naitik kartavya kaa paalan praayah sadaiv santoshkar hota he, bhale hi us kartavya paalan ke liye dhan, samay, shakti aadi kaa kshtakar vyay karnaa pade
 The joy of duty is different from other pleasures
 vah intaraatma kaa sukh hota he
 The person who performs self-worship by violating his selfishness has a special kind of joy
 gunatmak drushti se yah anand ucchtar naitik dharaatal par sankraman yaa vicharan karne kaa anand he
 This means that nature naturally wishes to uplift its consciousness
 jab koi granth, kalakriti yaa shastreey aalekh hamaari chetnaaon ko vaise unnayan yaa utthan kaa avasar detaa he to vah ruchikar evam anandaprad prathit hota he
 According to our belief, the main function of philosophy is to see, understand and explain the qualitative discernments of the said category
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki jahaan vibhinn bhautik vigyaan apane kshetra ke tatwon yaa shaktiyon kaa matradharmee adhyayan karte hai, vahaan darshan kii vibhinn shakhaayen vibhinn kotiyon ke gunatmak prabhedon kaa anushilan karti hai
 The realization of science gives us the ability to control things and powers, no part of philosophy gives such ability
 vah keval hamaari drushti yaa chetana kaa vistaar evam gunatmak parishkar karata he
 From this perspective, we will find what we call human learning
 arthath nar vigyaan, samajashaastra, raajnneetishastra, arthshaastra aadi-unki sthiti kahin bhautik vigyaanon or darshan ke bich main he
 In short, we can say that while science here and we mean mainly physical sciences, gives us the ability to control the physical environment, ie the natural world, while the work of philosophy furthers our qualitative perception and life
 kahana naa hoga ki yah bodh or kriyaayein hamaare aantarik, pratikbaddh yaa bhashashrith jivan kaa ang hai
 The ancient Upanishads or Vedanta and other Indian philosophies also propose that the seeker of salvation should perform enlightenment
 faltah bharatvarsh main kramshah yah mat grahya hua ki darshan kaa pramukh lakshya aatm-bodh he-jo moksh prapti kaa anyatam saadhan he
 It is important to note that Indian philosophy considers the presence of similar spirits not only in humans, but also in animals, birds and insects
 iske vipareet isai dharm main mana jaataa he ki aatma keval manushya main hoti he, anya praaniyon main nahin
 In the context of Indian philosophy, the second important thing is that the soul is considered to be uniform, formless
 uske swaroop ko sadaa ke liye jaan liya ja saktaa he
 Our opinion is different from this traditional intention
 hamaare anusaar sahitya or darshan donon kaa vishay manushya he
 In literature, we see nature and other living beings from the point of view of human beings and make the subject of realization
 tulsidas ne kaha ki kavy sahitya kaa vaastavik kaary ishwar kaa gungan hona chahie na ki praakrit nar kaa
 On the contrary, we are recommending that humans should be distinguished in literature
 ram or krishna vahiin tak kavy sahitya ke vishay ban sake, jahaan tak unhone manuyojit kaary-kalap kiye
 Thus — as the English poet Pope has said — the major, perhaps the only, subject of study and practice of our philosophy is man
 or yahan yah drushtavy he ki manushya ek aitihaasik evam vikasshil praani he
 Man's knowledge is constantly evolving, which means that his consciousness is constantly expanding
 yah chetana tathy-jagat se sambandhit rahati he, auki mulya-jagat se bhi
 It means that human awareness, self-realization and value-sense are all constantly changing and developing
 pracheen sanskrit bhashaa main jahaan ‘sansar’ evam ‘jagat’ vishwa kii gatimayata ko rekhaankit karte hai, vahaan prithvi ke ‘achala’ jaise naam yah bataate hai ki pracheen log dharti kii gatimayata se parichit na the
 This means that today's astronomy is different from ancient astronomy, similarly our knowledge of the nature-world has been constantly changing
 vaise hi hamaare moolyabodh main bhi parivartan hua he, hota rahaa he
 In today's democratic era, we do not accept that the so-called king or ruler resides in a deity, or that he is a deity in human form
 isi prakaar aaj ham stri ke satitv ko utana mahatv nahin dete or na naukaron kii namakhalaali par hi nirbhar kar pate hai
 Today, factory workers form unions and read the text of the rebellion
 aaj ke betaa-beti mata-pita kaa utana ajna-paalan or seva nahin karte jaisaa ki shravan kumaar kii or ram kii katha main pratifalit he
 Today, we do not have the same faith in the Vedas and the scriptures as in earlier eras
 aaj ke anek hindu mritak baap-dada kaa shraadh karnaa, unke uplakshya main prativarsh brahmanon ko khilaanaa aavashyak kartavya nahin maanate
 This means that today's ethics is becoming increasingly different from the old ages
 dhyaan dene kii baat yah he ki is parivartit moolyabodh or jagatbodh kaa bhi vaahak manushya hota he
 The consciousness or nature of this human being, due to these reasons, is changing
 darshan is badalte viksit hote hue chetanadharmee manushya ke swaroop kaa adhyayan-anushilan he
 Where various human sciences try to capture the said human being in the real state or reality, there is philosophy to follow the qualitative development of the human being
 ek or baat he
 The person who studies philosophy is not just a sensible physical entity
 manushya naam kaa praani apni vikasman, chetanadharmee samskruti kaa vaahak he; us samskruti kaa jo mukhyatya bhashaa aadi ke pratikon main rup main laabh karti he or jo peedi-dar-peedi viraasat ke rup main sakrant hoti chalati he
 From this point of view, it can be said that the subject of philosophy is the symbolic cultural activities or cultural creations of human beings, who take shelter of symbols and make themselves stable in a relative sense
 darshan manushya kaa adhyayan he, lekin vah manushya ke bhautik astitv yaa vyaktitv kaa adhyayan nahin karata
 On the contrary, he pursues the cultural activities of human beings that prescribe qualitative flourish in him
 is arth main darshan manushya kii ucchtam saanskrithik kriyaaon kii atmachetana he
 Philosophy is the pursuit and realization of man's cultural self
 upar hamane darshan ke swaroop kii maanavvaadi vyakhya prastut kii
 The question is, what is or should be the departure point of philosophy in the context of any problem
 kisi bhi vigyaan yaa vaigyanik chintan kaa prasthaan bindu praayah koi samasya hoti he, aisi samasya yaa prashn jo vigyaan vishesh kii suthere dhang se badhati yaa hoti-gati pragati main atkav daalati he
 The problem that strikes in the field of philosophy is revolution or far-reaching change in one or another area of prevailing value perception
 saamanyatya, samikshatmak avgati kaa vaahak hone ke naate, darshan mulyon ke kshetra main tar-tam bhav ke nirupan evam vyakhya kaa praytn karata he
 This formulation and interpretation is related to the age-value consciousness
 ek drushti se kaha ja saktaa he ki prayek kshetra main darshan apane-desh kaal kii mulya-sambandhi tar-tam bhav kii prachlit drushti kaa spashtikaran evam use saiddhanthik aadhaar dene kaa praytn hota he
 From a second point of view, he can be said to review popular beliefs and try to give them a new direction
 udhaaharan ke liye, manu ke samay main bhartiya samaaj main varnavyavastha kaayam ho chuki thi
 Prior to Manu, an attempt was made to give a theoretical basis to the varna system prevalent in Purusha Sukta, Manusmriti itself and other Dharma-sutra-texts and later in various Puranas in the form of creation stories or other stories
 darshan main punarjanm or vigat janmon ke karm-fal aadi ke rup main varna-vyavastha kaa saiddhanthik mandan prastut kiya gaya
 Today's progressive thinkers do not accept the system of apartheid, apartheid etc
, as a result, today's philosophy, ie, the philosophy of politics and polity, taking the shelter of democratic ideology, contradicting apartheid and apartheid, proves the equality of all mankind
 isai dharm ke itihaas main ishwar kii drushti main sab manushya samaan hai, is manyata ke aadhaar par manushyon kii samta par bal diya gaya he
 Similarly, in today's era, the virtue of a woman's loyalty or loyalty to a husband is no longer important, in Western countries, a woman demands equal rights as a man and divorces her by insulting or disobeying her husband
 aaj hamaare desh main bhi pati kii mrityu ke baad vidhwaa dwaara aatmadah ke samarthak nahin rah gayi hai or vidhwaa kaa punarvivaah bhi buree baat nahin samajhi jaati
 In western countries like America, now a divorced woman is not looked down upon
 is prakaar ke moolyabodh-sambandhi parivartanon ko samajhane-samajhane or vyaakhyaatmak tathaa saiddhanthik aadhaar dene kaa praytn darshan kaa pramukh kaary he
 Like moral sense, the value of human is also changing in the field of spirituality or religion
 aaj ham us karmyogi sant ko, jo gandhi kii bhanti janhit main tyaag kaa jivan vyateet karata he, adhik manyata dete hai-us sant kii apeksha jo himalay kii kandaraon main pravisht hokar moksh-sadhana karne kaa aadambar karata he
 It is known that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the supreme saint, had inspired his beloved disciple Swami Vivekananda to give a new awakening message and wisdom to the country
 darshan kaa ek mahatvapurn ang, kahana chahie uskaa aadharbhoot anushaasan, gyaan-mimasaa he, jisamen gyaan ke sampaadan evam pramanikaran kii prakriyaaon par vichaar hota he idhar ghatit hui vigyaan kii abhootpurv pragati ne darshanik jagat main khalabali utpann kar di he
 The question arises why there are so many differences between philosophical thinkers? a proper solution to this question gives the challenge and inspiration of far-reaching, tautological self-review to the branch of philosophy called knowledge-epistemology
 prashn he, antatah darshan ke vaktavy kis cheez ke bare main hote hai ? darshan ke kisi kshetra main paraspar virdohi yaa bhinnata rakhane vaale vaktavyon yaa prakathanon ke bich sahi-galat kaa kaise nirnay kiya jaye ? kya darshan ke kisi kshetra main nishchayatmak gyaan ho saktaa he ? kya darshan ke kshetra main kuch aise tatv hote hai, jinke aadhaar par vibhinn mantavyon ko sahi yaa galat athwa anshatah satya ghoshit kiya ja sake ? ye bade prashn hai, in or aise prashnon par prayek yug ke vichaarkon ko naye sire se sochna padataa he
 Today there is a situation of deadlock in our country's philosophy
 yadi hamaare vichaarak ukt prashnon par zimmedaari se or swatantra bhav se, purv or pashchim kii idhar tak kii darshanik pragati ke alok main, gambheer chintan shuru karen to nishchay hi hamaare darshan ko nayi gati or moulik disha yaa dishaaen praapt ho sakati hai
 Some older teachers believe that the questions and problems of philosophy are all-time and that the thinking of the ancient ages about them is as important today as it was in the earlier ages
 is maansikta ko paalate hue darshan ke kuch vidhyaarthee or poshak yah samajhate hai ki darshan ke vishisht kshetra main naye chintan kii apeksha nahin he or yah ki pracheen darshanon kaa anushilan jivan kii arthvatta evam lakshya ke bare main sarvakaleen praasangikta rakhata he
 But this notion is not completely acceptable
 mote taur par kaha ja saktaa he ki pracheen vichaarkon dwaara sanketit dharm, arth tathaa kaam or moksh ye chaar purusharth aaj bhi sarvagrahya hai
 But the fact is that every era and society defines and explains the said effort in its own way
 hamaare pracheen smritikar tathaa dharmasutron ke praneta samaaj-vyavastha or vyakti-jivan kii charya ke bare main kuch vichaar rakhte the, aaj ve vichaar apane mul rup main grahan nahin kiye ja sakate
 Today, retirement or military retirement can be accepted in various fields, possibly comparable rules were not there in the old ages
 us samay adarsh sthiti yah samajhi jaati thi ki vyakti pachaas varsh paar karte hue vanprasthi ban jaae or iske baad sanyasi
 Today, in the era of population explosion, there are no such places on earth where people entering Vanaprastha and Sannyas ashrams can live by taking food of fruits etc
 yon aaj bhi shri aravind, maharishi raman tathaa gandhi ji ke kuch anuyaayi ashramon main rahane kii suvidha paa sake hai, kintu vastutah waisi suvidhaayen har kisi ko uplabdh nahin hai
 The conclusion is that the nature of our life-related problems and beliefs have changed a lot in the changing environment of history
 dhyatavya he ki hamaare darshan or hindu-samskruti ke anyatam vyaakhyaata dow radhakshnan pracheen arth main na vanprasthi bane na sanyasi
 In an attempt to understand the use of philosophical thinking, the author has expressed a view that philosophy is the self-sacrifice of a culture
 ukt manyata ko ham do udhaaharan dekar spasht karenge
 Today's era is called the era of democracy
 janatantr ke tahat praayah samast nagarikon ko samaan adhikaar hote hai
 In an ideal democracy, all citizens, especially their children, should have the same facilities
 in suvidhaon main shiksha tathaa yogyata ke anuroop jeevika kii suvidhaayen mukhya hai
 Secondly, in the present age, birth is not given importance under caste or class
 yah duusari baat he ki prayek balak ko uske swaabhaavik rujhaanon evam yogyata ke anuroop shiksha evam kaary-kshetra kaa praavdhaan uchit samajha jaataa he
 The principle of birth caste is not considered as Brahman in any civilized society today
 germany ke taanashaah hitler kaa vichaar tha ki german logon tathaa arya-jatiyon ko itar samoohon par shashan karne kaa janmasiddh adhikaar he
 Hitler offered to expel mass groups called Jews from Germany
 dhyatavya he ki kathith yahudee jati ke sadsy visheshtah idhar ke itihaas main, vibhinn kshetron main ullekhneey kaary karte rahe hai
 For example, many German thinkers have given remarkable new ideas in relation to scientific exploration and economic political system
 yah ek aitihaasik sanyog he ki beesvin shatee ke katipay prakhyat vaicharik netaa yahudee the, jaise manovigyaan ke kshetra main frid, aarthik-raatnithik kshetra main karl marks or bhautik vigyaan ke kshetra main albert ainstin
