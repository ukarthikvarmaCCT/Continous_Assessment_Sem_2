 These are the permanent winds moving from subtropical high-pressure lanes to sub-polar low-pressure lanes
 inaki pashchami disha ke kaaran inhe 'pachhuva pawan' kehete hai
 Permanent winds flowing from subtropical high air pressure tropics towards subipolar low air pressure in both the Earth's hemispheres are called westerly winds due to their westward movement
 In the northern hemisphere, it flows from southwest to northeast and in the southern hemisphere from northwest to southeast
 The best development of the westward winds is found between 40 ° to 65 ° south latitudes, because of the vast expanse of the waters here, the speed of the winds is relatively fast and the direction is fixed
 Due to their intensity in the southern hemisphere, they 'scream chalis' between 40 and 50 degrees south latitude, 'prachanda Pachasa' in the adjacent areas of 50 degrees south latitude and 'screaming satha' near 60 degrees south latitude
 It is said that due to the huge land segment of uneven high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and the changing seasonal pattern of air pressure, the flow of this wind from the general western direction is unclear
 The range of these winds towards the pole is very unstable, which changes according to the weather and other reasons

 Kilimanjaro, with its three volcanic cones, Kibo, Mwenzie, and Shira, is a dormant Stratozhvalmukhi in northeastern Tanzania and is the highest mountain in Africa with a height of 5,895 meters or 19,341 feet above sea level
 Kilimanjaro Mountains is the highest free-standing mountain in the world as well as the fourth highest emerged mountain in the world which is 5,882 meters or 19,298 feet high from the base
 kilimanjaro naam kaa sateek arth or utpatti agyaat he
 It is believed to be a combination of the Swahili word Kilima and the Kichaga word Jaro, which translates to "whitewashed", from which the name White Mountain originated
 Another belief is that "jaro" in Chaga / Kichaga means 'our' and therefore Kilimanjaro means our mountain
 It is derived from the Chaga residents who live at the foothills of this mountain
 yah agyaat he ki kilimanjaro naam kahaan se aayaa he, lekin kai siddhant maujuud hai
 European explorers adopted the name by 1860 and stated that it was its Swahili name, and Kilimanjaro is divided into two parts, one is Kilima and the other is Jaro whose origin varies according to the principles - some people According to it is an ancient Swahili word meaning white or glow, or according to non-swahili origin it came from the Kichaga language, the word Jaro means "caravan"
 The problem with all of this is that they cannot explain why the term redundant kilima has been used instead of millima, the proper term for the mountain
 yah naam ek sthaneey hansi-mazaaq kaa hissaa ho saktaa he, jo "jaaro kii choti pahari" ko africa mahadweep kaa sabase bada pahaad sanderbhit karata he, kyonki yah paas kaa shahar he or guide bataate hai ki yah jaaro logon kii pahari he
 In a different view it is believed that it comes from Kichaga Kilmanare or Kiliajo which means "one who defeats birds / leopards / caravans"
 But this theory does not explain the fact that Kilimanjaro in Kitchaga was not used before in Europe in the mid-19th century
 1880 ke dashak main, yah parvat, jisaki german vartanee swahili naam ke ghatakon ke anusaar us samay kilima-ndscharo thi, german purv africa kaa ek hissaa ban gaya jab karl peters ne sthaneey mukhiyaaon ko sandhiyon par hastakshar karne ke liye manaaya 
 1889 main kibo shikhar kaa naam hanse mayer dwaara "kaisar-wilhem-spitje" rakhaa gaya, jab is shikhar par 5 oktober 1889 ko pehali baar chadhaai kii gai
 The name was used until 1918, when German colonies were given to the British Empire after World War I
 jab british prashasit tanganyika ko 1961 main apni swatantraaa praapt hui, to is shikhar kaa naam "uhuru shikhar" rakhaa gaya, jiskaa swahili main arth hota he "swatantraaa shikhar"
 The key-prefix has many underlying meanings in Swahili
 pracheen kaa-alparthak sangya upsarg ko, kii varg ke saath vilay kar diya gaya
 It has another meaning under which it describes anything unique: Kilima, a single peak, unlike Milima, which describes more of a mountain range or uneven country
 kai anya parvaton main bhi yah upsarg laga hua he, jaise ki kilima bogo jo kenya main nairobi ke bilkul uttar main sthit he
 People with disabilities are also placed in the same category, which is not that much of a diminutive idea; Rather a unique situation in which they are: a blind or deaf person, Kipofu and Kiziwi
 This prefix "ki-" does not imply derogatory meaning in any way

 There are six official climbing routes through which Mount Kilimanjaro can be climbed, their names are: Marangue, Rongai, Lemosho, Shira, Umbwe and Machame
 Of all the routes, Machame is quite panoramic, though its climb up the mountain is quite steep, which can be completed in six or seven days
 rongai sabase aasaan shivi maarg he or marangu bhi apekshaakrit aasaan he, lekin awaas jhopadiyon main hota he
 As a result, this route becomes very busy and the ascent and descent route is the same
 jo log kilimanjaro par chadhaai karnaa chaahate hai unhen upyukt shodh karne kii salaah di jaati he or yah sunishchit karne ke liye kaha jaataa he ki ve uchit rup se las hai or shaareerik rup se sakasham hai
 Although this climb is not technically as challenging as climbing the summit of the Himalayas, the high altitude, low temperatures and occasional strong winds make it a difficult and dangerous climb

 High altitude clubs have criticized Tanzanian authorities for charging fees for each day spent on the mountain

 Tanzanian medical services around the mountain have recently expressed concern over the growing influx of tourists who consider Kilimanjaro apparently an easy climb
 haalanki, maamla yah nahin he
 Many individuals require significant attention during their endeavor and many are forced to abandon their ascent
 is maamle main ek jaanch ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki tanzania jane vaale paryatakon ko aksar chadhaai karne vaale samoohon main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he bina yah bataae ki iske liye shaareerik swasthata kii anivaaryta kitni mahatvapurn he, haalanki kai saamagree vikreta or tour oparator shikhar tak pahunchane kii ucch safalataa dar kaa dikhaava karte hai
 Kilimanjaro National Park shows that only 30% of climbers actually reach the Uhru summit while most climbers return 300 meters below Uhru, at Gilman Point or 200 meters below Uhuru from Stella Point
 kilimanjaro ko aksar kam aanka jaataa he kyonki yah ek takneekee chadhaai nahin he
 However, many climbers consider Kilimanjaro to be physically very difficult climbs
 kuch logon kaa anumaan he ki mount everest kii tulana main kilimanjaro par chadhaai karte samay adhik logon ne apni jaan ganvaai he jabaki everest par apekshaakrit bahut kam parvatarohiyon ne chadhaai kaa prayaas kiya he

 For this reason, the route passing the Arrow Glacier was closed for several years

 To climb the Arrow Glacier route, climbers must leave early in the morning and cross the rocky surface before mid-afternoon because when the sun comes out, non-glacial rock ejaculation becomes quite common

 The low level of endemism at Kilimanjaro can lead to the destruction of low altitude forests, not the relatively young age of the mountains
 Another feature of Kilimanjaro's forests is the lack of bamboo area, which is present on all other high mountains with high rainfall, similar to East Africa
 sinarundineria alpina ko bhens or haathiyon dwaara pasand kiya jaataa he
 These killers on Kilimanjaro are found on the northern slope, where the area is dry for a long bamboo field

 yahaan tak ki mohammad gori ke dwaara jab prithviraj chouhan ko parrast karke evam unhe bandi bana karke gazani le jaaya gaya to ye bhi swayan ko vash main nahin kar sake evam gazani chale gayi
 It is believed that when Prithviraj, who was imprisoned, was blinded, his heart was moved by seeing him in this state and he planned to kill Ghori
 ukt yojana ke antargat inhone pehle to gori kaa hriday jeeta evam phir gori ko yah bataaya ki prithviraj shabdabhedi baan chalaa saktaa he
 Impressed by this, Mohammad Ghori expressed his desire to see this art of Prithviraj
 pradarshan ke din chand bardaayi gori ke saath hi manch par baithe
 The blind Prithviraj was brought to the field and asked to showcase his art
 prithviraj ke dwaara jaise hi ek ghante ke upar baan chalaaya gaya gori ke munh se akasmaat hi "vaah! vaah!!" shabd nikal padaa bas phir kya tha chandbaradaayi ne tatkaal ek dohe main prithviraj ko yah bataa diya ki gori kahan par evam kitni oonchaai par baitha hua he
 The couplet was as follows: chaar baans choubees gaj, angul asht pramaan! ta upar sultan he, mat chuke chouhan!! Thus Ghori was killed by Prithviraj with the help of Chand Bardai

 Fuel tax can work as an incentive for more efficient production, so for lower pollution, car design and development of alternative fuels
 High fuel tax encourages buyers to make lighter, smaller and more fuel efficient cars, Or do not run a Fee car
 Generally, today's automobile can be rebuilt 75 percent and using recycled steel we can use the car to reduce energy usage and pollution
 In the United States, Congress made Faderahalli mandatory fuel efficiency, which was regularly debated, although passenger car standards could not be improved more than what the standard was made in 1985
 Light truck standards have also changed very quickly and were reported in 2007
