 ghatnakriyashastra ke anusaar agar in karkon ko anubhav se alag kar diya jaae to gyaan ke dharaatal par ek vishuddh aatmanishthata praapt kii ja sakati he
 German philosopher Edmund Husser was the founder of this philosophy
 unka kahana tha ki sabhi tarah kii chetana hameshaa sabhipraay yaa iradatan hoti he
 That is, we are not only conscious, but conscious of something
 zaruri nahin ki us vastu kaa bhautik vajood ho hi
 For example, if someone feels that an oasis is present in front of her, then she can also be a patient
 asal main vah nachlistaan vastav main nazar ke saamne na hone ke baavjood dekhne vaale ke liye uske saath banaaye gayi sarthak sambandh ke kaaran abhasith hota he
 Therefore, whether it is oasis or its malaise, the object is able to fulfill the expectations made by her observer
 isse hasar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki vyakti kaa anubhav vastu ke saath kaary-kaaran sambandh kaa mohataaj nahin hota

 In addition to Heidegger, the thinking of Maurice marli-ponty, jean-paul Sartre was also influenced by phenomenology
 isi aadhaar par alfred shuz dwaara finomenoljical sosiolji kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 Phenomenology has developed by communicating with the basic principles of natural sciences

 To say that Dekart and Hassar had the same intellectual project
 donon hi gyaan ke muladharon ko anischitataaon se mukt karnaa chaahate the
 But this interpretation of Hassar took the philosophy from Dekart towards the next stage
 unka uddeshy anubhavgat vastuon ko dekhne kaa ek anivaary or nishchit tarika viksit karne kaa tha
 Dekart believed that the existence of God and self cannot be doubted, but it is logically possible to doubt everything else
 lekin hasar kisi vishwaas yaa aasthaa par sanshay karne cabajaay uski prakruti main nihit asandigdh tatva kii shinaakht karne kii taraf gayi
 He tried to find out what is the pre-conceived component of the experience of an object by examining every action of consciousness
 is purv-kalpit hisse ko bina uske sahi yaa galat hone kaa faisalaa kiye agar kinare rakh diya jaae to us anubhav kii sachai par koi fark nahin padegaa
 Hassar termed the act of keeping the edge in his language as 'bracketing' and not taking the decision of right or wrong
 unhone ek vriksh kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki agar kisi vriksh ke hone se judi rozmarra kii purvadhaaran ko multavee kar diya jaae to usase vriksh-sambandhi us anubhav main tabdili nahin aayegi jo chetana ke madhyam se praapt kiya gaya he
 Dekart's thesis stops at the place where he considers the existence of 'I' to be at least a definite basis of doubt or knowledge
 hasar ne kisi ke hone ke anubhav ko usamen nihit purv-kalpanaaon se mukt karne kii tajaviz kii
 This was a radical step in the field of contemplation
 vastu ke anubhav ke saath judi pehle se bani samaj ke aadhaar main aitihaasik, saanskrithik or bhautik kaarak hote hai jinaki pramanikta hameshaa andeh ke daayre main rahati he
 If a true understanding of an object or person is to be made, it should not be understood as a historical shay, because in that case that understanding will be filtered through the filters of preconceptions and pre-conceptions
 is tarah ghatnakriyashastra ke rup main ek vishuddh or aparivartaneey aatmanishthata kaa nishchit gyaan praapt karne kii vidhi saamne aayi
 Hassar's two works, Logical Investigations and Ideas Protecting to a Pure Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy, published between 1901 and 1913, are considered to be the major texts of this philosophy
 gyaan ke is prabhaavshaalee siddhant kii pramukh samasya yah thi ki use darshanikon kaa mohataaj hone kii seemaa se kaise nikaala jaae
 It was difficult to establish as a natural tendency to create knowledge in the world of everyday community life and culture
 1938 main prakashit apni antim rachana chrysis of european science and trancedental finominolji main hasar ne is samasya kaa hal khojane kii koshish kii
 He strongly criticized the principled approach of natural sciences and kept it against the subjective attitude
 unka kahana tha ki prakritik vigyaan kaary-kaaran sambandh or maatraatmakataa par itnaa jor dete hai ki vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn preranaon, aasthaaon or kaamanaayon kaa unke liye koi mahatva hi nahin rah jaataa
 He further developed the thesis of being aware of consciousness, that on the basis of different attitudes people make sense of their world
 saundaryashastra ke kshetra main hasar or ghatnakriyashastra kaa prabhaav roman ingarden ke sutrikarnon main dekha ja saktaa he
 Enggarden refuses to identify the literary work as an intentional object on the basis of its physical element
 is vichaar ke anusaar saahitiyik kriti apni vividh vyakhyaaon se swatantra ek tikaoo kism kii asmita se sampann hoti he
 Criticizing the work, the reader pays attention to its essence and in the process draws concrete conclusions from the content of the imagined elements that have been left undetermined by the author
 ghatnakriyashastra ke buniyadi thisis se prabhavit hasar ke anuyaayiyon ne unke bhavvaadi ravaiye ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Heidegger and then Sartre focused their attention on an observer who was concerned with a real, physical and tactical world, compared to the more or less intangible existence of the observer whose experience centered on philosophy
 hasar anubhav ke taatpary ko ek anivaary or saarvbhaum saar ke rup main dekhte the, jabaki hidagar ne us taatpary ko zindagi kii vyaavhaarik samasyaon se guzarane ke dauraan hone vaale anubhav kaa nateeja bataaya
 Heidegger said that humans make sense of the hammer according to what they use
 isliye ghatnakriyashastra ke mutabik rache gayi vivaran se bani saarvbhaum samaj ke bajaay vibhinn lakshyon kaa peechha karte hue saadhaaran insaan apane gyaan kii rachana karata he

 lord dalhousie ne aise dattak grahan ko manjuuri dene evam ashrith rajyon ke maamle main dattak kii anupasthiti main apane vivekaanusaar kaarywai karne ke param adhikaron par jor diya
 In practice, this meant the rejection of last-minute adoption and the merger of states with no natural or adoptive successors, as Lord Dalhousie believed that western governance was better than eastern and should be implemented wherever possible
 swaabhaavik yaa dattak na hone ke kaaran satara , jaitpur-sanbhalpur, baghat , udaipur , jhansi , nagpur , karauli or avadh rajyon kaa vilay kar diya gaya
 According to the lapsed principle, the first state merged was Satara

 Lord Dalhousie merged with it, declaring it a dependent state

 According to this theory, the position and momentum of a moving particle cannot be measured exactly simultaneously
 yadi ek raashi adhik shuddhta se maapi jaaegi to duusari ke maapan main utani hi ashuddhta bad jaaegi, chaahe ise maapne main kitni hi kushalta kyon na barti jaae

 The relationship of uncertainty on the one hand is the inevitable result of the laws of probability of establishing the consistency of a wave's position with the particle, and on the other the broader rules of probability interpretation

 In this way, Heisenberg proved that in the world of microscopic particles the usefulness of measuring instruments is limited

 Today, almost all physicists accept the impossibility of inventing a measuring instrument that can violate the limits contained in this theory

 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance

 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness

 yah paribhaasha is sambhaavna ko dhyaan main rakhti he ki rogiyon main madhumeh pehle se ho par iskaa nidaan na hua ho, yaa garbhavastha main madhumeh melitas utpann hui ho
 nidaan kaa is baat se koi sambandh nahin he ki garbh kii samaapti ke baad lakshan kam hote hai yaa nahin
 Based on the name of Priscilla White, which paves the way for research on the effects of diabetes types on perinatal outcomes, it is mostly used to estimate mother and fetal risk
 yah garbhakalin madhumeh or garbhaadhan ke pehle se maujuud madhumeh ke bich antar sthapit karata he
 These two groups are further subdivided according to their associated risk and treatment
 garbhakalin madhumeh ke 2 upaprakaar hai: The second group of diabetic pre-existing pregnancies is also divided into various subtypes
 garbhakalin madhumeh ke viksit hone ke paaramparik jokhim kaarak nimna hai: Additionally, the data suggest that smokers have twice the risk of GDM
 bahuputick andashay rogesamooh bhi ek jokhim ghatak he, haalanki isse sambandhit pramaan vivaadaaspad hai
 More controversial risk components, such as shorter height, have been noted in some studies
 jidiem se grast lagbhag 40-60% striyon main koi pratyaksh jokhim ghatak nahin paaya jaataa he, isaliye kai log sabhi striyon kii jaanch kii salaah dete hai
 Women with gestational diabetes do not have any symptoms, but some women may see more thirst, excessive urination, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, bladder infection, mildew infection and blurred vision
 garbhakalin madhumeh kii nishchit kriyavidhi kii jaankaree gyaat nahin he
 The characteristic sign of GDM is increased immunity to insulin
 aisa anumaan he ki garbhaadhan ke hormone or anya ghatak insulin ke insulin graahak se bandhan kii kriya main hastkshep karte hai
 This interference probably occurs at the level of the cell signaling pathway behind the insulin client
 
 chunki insulin adhikansh koshikaon main glucose ke pravesh ko badhaava detaa he, insulin-pratirodh glucose ko uchit rup se koshikaon main pravesh karne se roktaa he
 As a result, glucose remains in the bloodstream, which increases the levels of glucose in it

 Insulin resistance is a normal activity occurring in the second trimester of pregnancy, which then rises to levels in pregnant patients with type 2 diabetes
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki yah prakriya viksit ho rahe bhrun ke liye glucose kii aapurti nishchit karti he
 Women with GDM have an insulin resistance, which they cannot compensate by increased production of β-cells of the pancreas
 Placental hormones and to some extent increased fat accumulation in pregnancy mediate insulin resistance
 cortisol or projesteron mukhya apradhi hote hai, par maanviya aparaa lactogen, prolactin or astradiul bhi isamen bhaag lete hai
 It is unclear why some patients are unable to balance their insulin needs, leading to the development of GDM, which has been interpreted in various ways like type 2 diabetes - autophagy, single gene mutation, obesity, and Other actions
 glucose ke vaahakon dwaara sugamit prasar dwaara) aparaa main pravesh karne ke kaaran bhrun ko ucch glucose staron kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 This increases the insulin level of the fetus
 The growth-stimulating effects of insulin can lead to excessive growth and a larger body
 After birth, the high glucose environment disappears, leading to an overproduction of insulin in those newborns and a condition of lowered glucose levels in the blood
 paribhaashit paristhitiyon main plasma yaa serum main glucose ke ucch staron kaa pataa lagane ke liye kai jaanch or nidaankaarak pareekshanon kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 One of its methods is a phased method under which clinical testing is performed after questionable results are obtained from the test

 Non-challenging blood glucose tests measure glucose levels in blood samples without challenging the patient with glucose solution
 glucose ke staron kaa nirdhaaran niraahaar, bhojan ke 2 ghante baad yaa kisi bhi samay kiya jaataa he
 In contrast, challenge tests measure the amount of glucose in the blood by drinking a solution of glucose - a higher amount in diabetes

 Most obstetricians in the United States prefer universal screening with screening glucose tolerance testing
 united kingdom main prasuti ikaiyaan akasar jokhim ghatakon or random rakt glucose pareekshan par bharosa karti hai
 The American Diabetes Association and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada recommend regular screening except for the patient's low risk
 da canadian diabetes association or american college of obstetriciouns and gayanecologists saarvbhaumik screening kii sifarish karte hai
 The us The Preventive Services Task Force has found that there is insufficient evidence in favor or opposition to routine screening

 ye pareekshan pehali prasutipurv nirikshan ke samay kiye jate hai
 These are pleasant and inexpensive for the patient, but are less useful than other tests due to their moderate sensitivity, low specificity and high false positive rate

 Architecture has been and is a branch of fine arts, with the aim of taking the support of industrialization and constructing a good building in terms of utility, whose environment is highly cherished, cherished and cherished and cherished for the cultured and artistic interest

 Such a configuration of maps and objects and enriching the structure in the most appropriate way, which creates a lot of interestingness, beauty, greatness, unity and power with maximum features

 Architectures are important in the history of a caste when civilization, prosperity and luxury come to them in some degree and they fully express the nature of caste pride, prestige, ambition and spirituality
 pracheen kaal main vaastukala sabhi kalaon kii janani kahi jaati thi
 But with the change of instinct and participation of allied businesses, it is no longer the seal of inclusive protection
 vaastukala puraatan kaal kii saamaajik sthiti prakaash main laanevaala mudranalay bhi kahi gai he
 This is as far as social and other achievements are concerned
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki vaastukala bhawanon ke alankaran ke atirikt or kuch nahin he
 This is partly true as far as historical architecture is concerned
 phir vaastukala sabhyataa kaa saanchaa bhi kahi gai he
 As far as the archaeological influence is concerned, it is fine, but with a brief look at the history of architecture, it will be clear that the earliest efforts of humans are seen as the habitat cave-habitats of the hunters, the tents of the shepherds and the huts of the peasants
 nauka-awaas or vrikshon par bani jhopadiyaan purakalin vishistataaen hai
 The earliest attempts to build a religious monument were in the form of stone and wooden fences
 in adikalin prayaason main or unke sudhare hue roopon main sabhi deshon main kuch na kuch baaten aisi mahatvapurn or vishisht prakaar kii hai ki bahut din baad kii mahanatam kala kritiyon main bhi ve pratyaksh hai
 In the rapid development of the ages, architecture was developed, molded and adapted to the changing needs of humans - its security, work, religion, pleasure and other epoch-making symbols
 misr ke sade swaroop, china ke maanak abhikalp-swaroop, bharat ke videshi tathaa samrudh swaroop, mexico ke may or astek kii angadh mahima, yunaan ke atyant viksit devaytan, roman samrajya kii bahuvidh aavashyaktaaon kii purti karanevaale jatil prakaar ke bhawan, purakalin aadambaraheen giraje, mahan gothic girizaa bhawan or chitropam durg, turki imaaraton ke utkrisht vinyas evam anupaat or europea punarutthan ke bhavy vaastukiy smarak aitihaasik vaastu ke satat vikaas kaa lekha prastut karte hai
 All these buildings point to great epochs of human development, in which architecture is highly related to the ethnic life, reflecting the talent and ambition of the castes who have a clear imprint on their monuments
 prayek aitihaasik vaastu kii uplabdhiyaan mote taur se do moolbhoot siddhanton se nishchit kii ja sakati hai, ek jo sankalpana main antarnihit he or doosraa jo sarvocch vishistataa kaa dyotak he
 In Egyptian Vastu it is the mystification expressed by huge and massive monuments, in Assyrian, Babylonian and Iranian art, it was armament and luxurious life, in Greek art it was decidedly planned and modified vision which resulted in simplicity and refined perfection
 romanon main yah bhavyata, anand evam shakti kaa prem tha jiske falswaroop vilakshan vaigyanik nirmaan hua
 Among the ancient Christians, this was in the form of a great zeal for the construction of churches that expressed the true simplicity and pride of Jesus Christ; Amongst Gothic makers, this structure was an ardent force with knowledge of mechanics; In the Italian revival it was the scholar of that era
 buddha or hindu vaastukala kaa utkrisht gun uskaa aadhyatmik tatv he, ja uske vikaas main adyopant pratyaksh he
 His dominance over unimaginable wealth, wealth and vast plots in Muslim architecture reflects; Whereas the great Afghani Vastu of India reveals the aggressive tendency of that regime; But the Mughal monuments are excellent in showing the excellent proportions of the Mughals and the love of work and express their life in the warmth of India
 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background
 aaj bhi ham pratibhavan vyaktiyon ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt swaroop tatolte rahete hai
 Today, there are some people who are satisfied to follow the ghost, there are others who try to emulate the foreign way
 bahut thode se aise hai jo apane samay, gati or rashtriya drushtikaan ke anuroop vaastu kaa vikaas karte kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The effort of this small class is to present a new impact, which inspires the human to think and hold new ideas
 is prakaar se hamaare yug ke bhawan nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai or baad main ye hi bhawan sharir or mastishk ke swasth vikaas ko protsaahat karke jati kaa nirmaan karenge
 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama
 There is no doubt that buildings are the basis of architecture, but apart from erecting these buildings there is something else like poetry prose is something other than composition
 mithe swar main gaae jane par kavita prabhaavshaalee hoti hi he, kintu jab uske saath upyukt sangeet or layayukt nrity cheshtaayen bhi hoti hai tab vah keval manushya ke hriday kii or vibhinn indriyon ko hi aakarshith nahin karti apitu inke gauravpurn mail se nirmit saare vaataavaran se hi use avgat karaati he
 Likewise, archetypes are replete with philosophical activities, poetic expressions and inclusive lyrical, musical and descriptive meanings, and such exquisite artefacts deserve to be admired by the human in all respects and then gain worldwide fame
 sarvasammat mahan vaastukritiyon kii yah prashasti chirsthayee hoti he or bhavi pidiyon ko prerana detii he
 It is true that there has been a lot of instability in the use of architecture, revealing numberless styles
 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose to the styles, such as the changing fashion has no relation to a woman's dress
 is vishay main frankllid rhite ne kaha he ki vaastukala kii paridhi idhar udhar hatati rahati he, uskaa centre nahin badalata
 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he
 If seen in this context, architecture should be a complete and well-developed creation of one's own initiating mind, which reaches a higher level of self

 vidyut-maapi yaa 'urjamapi' saamanyat: un sabhi upkarnon ko kaha jaataa he vidyut urja kaa maap karne ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Electrometers are often calibrated in kilowatt-hours
 kuch vidyut maapi vishesh kaaryon ke liye vyavasthit hote hai, jaise mahattam maang sansuchak, jisamen meter ke saath aisa kaal anshak hota he jo nishchit avadhi main adhiktam urja kaa nirdesh kare
 There are also some electromagnets that automatically cut off the load at the time of maximum load
 kisi nishchit avadhi main upyukt honevaali vidyut urja kii maap karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vidyutmapi paripath main dhara, voltata tathaa shakti gunank teenon kii uchit maap karne main tathaa unhen samaklit karke kisi nishchit avadhi main kharch honevaali urja kaa maapan kar sakane main samarth ho
 Thus any electrometer has two fractions: shakti anshak, disht dhara evam prayavarti dhara main bhinn bhinn praroop kaa hota he
 In the direct current, due to not having the power coefficient, it is sufficient to be able to multiply the current and the voltage of the power factor
 yadi voltata ko sthir maan liya jaae, to keval dhara maapan se hi kaary chal saktaa he
 In this form the electrometer becomes literally ampere-hour meter
 yah keval yahi bataata he ki nishchit avadhi main kitni dhara prayukt kii gai he
 Thus an ampere-hour implies that 1 ampere current is consumed in 1 hour at a fixed voltage
 yadhyapi banaavat main aise upkaran saral hote hai, tathaapi spashtat: voltata ke ghatane badhane se unke dwaara nirdeshit urja main galati ho jaati he
 Nevertheless, due to its simple texture, they are very suitable for general uses

 There are two magnets on either side of the disc, one of which is called a conduction magnet: and the other a brake magnet
 ghuraagra dhara ke vaahak kaa bhi kaary karata he
 The current flows through the grating to the disc and thence through the mercury to the stationary terminal on the cell
 is prakaar paripath paare main hokar puraa hota or chaalan chumbak kii uttejk kundali main se pravaahit hoti hui dhara discs par chaalan bal aropit karti he
 Disk revolves around being self-sufficient for cruises
 uskaa brake chumbak ke kshetra main paribhraman, usapar brake bal aropit karata he
 By adjusting the position of the brake-magnet, the speed of the disc can be changed
 yadi motor thik na chal rahaa ho, to roak chumbak kii sthiti kaa vyavasthaapan karke thik kiya ja saktaa he
 In the second type of ampere hour scales, the current decomposition effect is used
 kisi nishchit avadhi main, vidyut apghaty main se paarit hoti hui dhara jitna avshesh jamaa karti he, uskaa pariman paripath main upbhog kii gai urja ke anupaat main hota he
 But the meters of this type do not have strong texture and have to be arranged repeatedly
 at: is praroop ke meter adhik chalan main nahin hai
 Power meters in direct current meters are similar to wattmeters
 inamen vastut: do paripath hote hai, Being affected by the transient values of current and voltages of these two coils, the conductor of the fraction indicates the average power in the circuit
 pra
dha
 meter, mukhyat:, do praroop ke hote hai : Both meters are actually based on their own type of wattmeter
 shaktianshak ke saath kashenshak jod dene se hi unase urja kaa maapan kiya ja saktaa he
 The calcimeter is actually like a clock, which integrates power over a certain period of time and directs energy
 watametre main sanketak dwaara shakti kaa nirdesh hi kiya ja saktaa he
 While counting the revolutions of the disc in the electric scale, energy is measured
 discs athwa drum ke paribhraman ginaney ke liye ek ganaktantr hota he, jisase kul urja kaa maan padhaa ja saktaa he
 In another type of meter, only the small part of the motor is used
 isamen dhara kundali, uttejk ke rup main hoti he or voltata kundali, armechar ke rup main
 The armature is also accompanied by a commutator and there are two burushes that touch
 is prakaar vah meter, vastut: motor kaa chota rup hi he
 It is called 'motor meter' for this reason, but due to its high cost and due to care difficulties, it is used very rarely
 trifage paripathon main urja maapan bhi trifage shakti maapan ke aadhaar par hi kiya jaataa he
 Like the triphase wattmeter, the power fraction is also divided into two parts and the combination is also done by two wattmeters on the basis of power efficiency
 is prakaar isamen 6 terminal haate hai or unhen trifage watametre kii bhanti hi sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 Only by adding the time fraction and counting system can it measure energy
 sookshm electronic evam microcontrolar aadi ke vikaas ne electranik urjamitaron kaa vikaas sambhav bana diya he
 Their display is based on LCD or LED
 kuch meter paathyank ko duurastha sthanon par sanchaarit bhi karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Apart from this, electronic energetics can record supply and some other parameters of load, such as maximum demand, voltage, power coefficient, reactive power, etc
 electronic matdaan ek aisa shabd he jisamen matdaan ke liye prayukt electronic saadhan or matganana ke liye prayukt electronic saadhan, donon ke samavesh sahit kai alag prakaar ke matdaan shaamil he

 Electronic voting technology can speed up ballot counting and provide better access for disabled voters
 tathaapi, yah vivaad maujuud he, vishesh rup se sanyukt rajya america main ki electronic voting, visheshkar DRE matdaan chunavi dhokhadhadi ko susadhy kar saktaa he
 The use of electronic voting system for voters has been in vogue since the 1960s, when the punch card system was introduced
 nai optical scan matdaan pranali mataptr par matadaata ke sanket kii computer dwaara ginati ko anumat karti he
 The DRE voting machine, which collects and tabulates votes in a single machine, is used by all voters in Brazil and all elections in India and is also used extensively in Venezuela and the United States
 unka upyog netherland main bhi bade paimaane par kiya gaya, lekin janata dwaara chintaa jataane par hataa liya gaya
 Internet voting systems have gained popularity and were used in government elections and referendums in the United Kingdom, Estonia and Switzerland, as well as municipal elections in Canada and party primary elections in the United States and France
