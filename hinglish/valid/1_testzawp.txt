 Not obeying Harry, Voldemort uses the Death Penalty Curse from the Elder Wand, but the Elder Wand does not kill his master; For this reason, the mantra returns to him and Voldemort, whose Horcrux had already been destroyed, eventually dies

 Unlike the novel, filmmaker David Heyman has not shown his peers catlike and blue eyed, as he believed that doing so would not create fear in the audience

 Note: The names 'thomas' and 'mary' Riddle are taken from the film and Delphini's appearance is only in the cursed child drama
 isamen potter parivaar ko nahin darshaya gaya he
 The Riddle family, an old noble family, was born Tom Riddle Sr
, son of Thomas and Mary Riddle
 yah parivaar little hanglaton kasbe kii ghati ke lagbhag aadhi sampatti kaa maalik tha tathaa us thomas us kasbe ke sabase prasiddh vyakti the
 He lived in a big house, but was also infamous among the local citizens for his pompous behavior

 Rolling reveals in Harry Potter and the half-blood Prince that the young Meroopi Gaunt made every effort to get close to Tom Riddle, keeping an eye on him from the windows and bushes at every opportunity
 moffin ne apni bahan kaa tom ke prati prem ko bhaap liya tha or us par jaadu kaa prayog karne laga
 It was a violation of the rules of witchcraft that led to a fierce battle with the Ministry of Magic and after this Moffin and his father Marvolo were imprisoned in Azkaban
 dambldor ke anusaar is bich meropi bilkul akeli ho gayi or us par pita kaa niyantran khatm ho gaya tha, vah tom se ab berokatoke mil jul sakati thi
 She gives Tom a drink containing the love decoction

 At the same time, she also reveals her sorceress with the belief that either he will truly love her by knowing this or else he will stop at least in love with his unborn child
 parantu vah galat sabit hui or tom ne use yah sachai pataa lagate hi chhod diya or vah apane mata-pita ke saath aakar rahane laga
 His son Tom Marvolo Riddle was born on 31 December 1926 and his mother Meropi died as soon as he was born and grew up in an orphanage

 gont nivas ke adhiktar bhaag ko harry potter or haaf-blad prince main dambldor ke smriti paatr ke madhyam se prishthbhumi main darshaya gaya he
 The Gaunt family was an influential and powerful family in the past and Salazar was the last known descendant of Slytherin
 smriti paatr main dikhaayi gayi kahani ke anusaar unki meropi ke shuddh rakt jaadugar se shaadi karne kii jidd ke kaaran jaadu mantralay se unka bheeshan yuddh hota he jiske kaaran ve garibi kaa jivan jeene lagate hai
 Like the Riddle family, the Gaunt family was notorious among the local citizens as they lived in a muddy area and the other due to their vicious behavior, their image became rude and intimidating
 marvolo gont, gont parivaar ke antim vanshaj the
 He and his son are sent to Azkaban for a short period on charges of attacking the officials of the Ministry of Magic

 Since Moffin was the last man in the Gaunt family, for this reason, the Gaunt family comes to an end after his death
 meropi gont marvolo kii putree tathaa moffin kii bahan thi
 Harry's first impact on Meropi was as the most defeated human to date
 sambhawatah us par aisa prabhaav meropi ke garibi, malinta va ashisht logon ke bich paalan poshan hone ke kaaran padaa
 She eloped and married Tom Riddle Sr
 and became pregnant only three months later
 pehle usne tom ko prem kadha dekar use apane prem main vasheebhoot kiya parantu jab vah garbhvatee hui to usne kadha dena band kar diya
 She stopped brewing with this hope because she did not want to live her untrue life any longer and she also wanted her husband Tom to love her genuinely, as well as hope that her husband at least Will stop being in love with your unborn child
 lekin aisa nahin hota he or tom sachai pataa lagate hi use chhod kar chalaa jaataa he
 Frustrated with all these developments, Meropi starts wandering the streets of London
 ab uske paas keval khandaani sone kaa lacket bachaa tha, jo ki uske purvaj salaajaar slidarin kaa tha, usne kam keemat main bech diya
 When she was about to give birth to her son, she somehow arrives at the Magalu orphanage, where her son Tom Marvolo Riddle is born
 uske janm ke agle ghante hi meropi kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Garmlath was a seventeenth-century descendant of Gaunt Salazar Slytherin
 uske paas salaajaar slidarin kii hi chadi thi
 Educated at Hogwarts, Garmlath lived in Ireland in the first half of the seventeenth century

 He believed that his parents' proximity to the Magalas was not right for Isolt
 krur or kattar garmaleith ne islot ko magaluon se alag-thalag karne ke liye uske upar kaale jaadu kaa istemaal kiya, use chadi kaa istemaal nahin karne diya, hoguarts main daakhila bhi nahin lene diya, jaisaa ki usne khud kiya tha
 After living with her for 12 years, Islot stole Garmlath's wand and she fled to the American colony and moved to Massachusetts
 vahaan par usne ilvermorni jaadu tona or tantra mantra vidhyalay main daakhila le liya
 When Gormlath finds out this, she follows her niece to Massachusetts where she is murdered by Islot's friend

 After Rolling regained his body in the fourth edition of the novel, Voldemort was left with pale skin, a white face like a chalice, a snake-like nasal cavity, a red-eyed and cat-like gullible, skeleton-like body, and unnaturally long fingers
 He is shown with big and thin hands
 upanyaas ke saatven sanskaran ke pehle adhyay ke anusaar uske paas bal tathaa hont bhi nahin the
 According to the stories seen by Smriti Patra in the past in the second and sixth editions, he was beautiful and tall with pale skin, jet black hair and dark brown eyes
 vah apane luk se sabhi ko aakarshith kar saktaa tha
 It is speculated that the reason for his becoming a human being was to divide his soul into a Horcrux in his desire to become immortal
 film main voldemort kii aankhe neeli tathaa pupil golakaar he
 Rolling describes Voldemort as "the worst wizard of hundreds of years"
 unhone use "atyadhik manorogi, anya logon kii pidaa par manushyik pratikriya kaa abhavi" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 At the same time, he has been shown to be the slayer of others, especially the Maghuls, because of his happiness
 uske andar chetana kaa abhaav tha, vah apane kiye par use koi pachhtaawaa nahin hota tha tathaa vah apane atirikt insaaniyat kaa mahatva bhi nahin samajhataa tha
 He neither liked to establish companionship or friendship with man nor did he have any love or affection for anyone
 vah swayan ko shreshth samajhataa tha or apane saamne sabhi ko hin maanata tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was "a truly starving, racist of incredible strength"
 agar vah khwaish darpan main dekhtaa to vah swayan ko "sarvashaktimaan or avinashi" ke rup main dekhtaa jaisaa vah chahta tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was born as a result of a love decoction by his mother and sorceress Meropi Gaunt on a Magaloo and his father Tom Riddle, a result of a failed love
 kaadhe kaa asar khatm hone va pita ke uski maan ko chhod dene ke kaaran uski maan kii mrityu ho jaati he, lekin agar uski maan jivit rahati or use pyaar detii to avashya sab kuch badal gaya hota
 The attraction that led to the transformation of the boy born as Tom Riddle to Voldemort is very necessary because it shows the concept that led to this character
 lagbhag sabhi khalnaayakon ke samaan, voldemort kaa dambh hi uske patan kaa kaaran banataa he
 He was extremely afraid of death, which he described as a shameful and disgusting human weakness
 uske andar ahamkaari hone ke kai lakshan the
 In front of his life-worshipers, Voldemort confesses that he paid the great price for the attack on Harry's parents, and then observes what went wrong, and in the end he takes the blame on himself
 rolling ne yah likhaa he ki uskaa bahurupia uski antim yatra hoti
 Rolling states the difference between Voldemort and Harry, stating that Harry had accepted death, for this reason he eventually emerged stronger than he was
 puri shrunkhlaa main rolling ne voldemort ko atyadhik shaktishaalee, budhimaan or nirmam dusht jaadugar bataaya he
 He could read others' minds well and also prevent others from entering his own mind
 dambaldor ke atirikt vah ek maatr aisa gyaat jaadugar tha jo chup chaap chhu-mantar ho jaataa tha
 Voldemort feared Dumbledore, the only magician
 antim pustak main voldemort ko bina kisi sahare ke udata dikhaaya gaya, jisane bhi yah padhaa yaa dekha vah achambhit rah gaya
 Like his ancestors, he could also talk to snakes in snake language
 use yah kaushal apane purvaj salaajaar slidarin se mila
 The Gaunt family also used this language in their own conversation
 yah asaadhaaran lakshan usame sambhavtah anuvanshik rup se aa gaya ho, kyonki gont parivaar main yah parampara rakt kii shuddhta banaaye rakhane ke liye nibhaai jaati thi
 When Voldemort attempts to assassinate the newborn Harry, Harry's art of speaking in snake language along with part of his soul also goes away
 jab vah aatma kaa hissaa harry main mar jaataa he to harry main yah shakti khatm ho jaati he
 While watching an old story in the sixth part, Voldemort claimed during a job interview in front of Dumbledore that he had "increased the limits of magic more than ever"
 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort kii jaadui gyaan kisi bhi jivit jaadugar se bahut adhik he or yahan tak ki voldemort ke puri shakti ke saath lautne par uske mantron ke saamne dambldor ke paas sabase taqatvar bachaav mantra hone kaa gyaan bhi aparyaapt hoga
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort is probably the smartest student of Hogwarts
 parantu voldemort main yah vilakshan pratibha tathaa kaushal hote hue bhi vah pyaar jaise shaktishaalee jaadu kaa saamana karne main ayogy tha; is samay koi shaktiyaan kaam nahin karti thi
 This greatest magical disqualification has been shown in the entire series
 voldemort prarambh main apni jaadui shaktiyon par andeh karne lagata he, magar apane sharir va takat waapas paane ke baad apane praan bhakshiyon ke saamne vah ye sweekaar karata he ki usne lily potter kii us pyaar kii takat ko andekha kar diya tha jisane harry kii jaan bachaai
 Rolling has revealed on his website that Voldemort's wand was made from a verdant tree with poisonous juice that symbolized his death
 ise soch samajhakar harry kii chadi ke samaan aksh vaala banaaya gaya, jo ki ek sadabahaar kaatedaar jhaadi se bani thi
 He chose it because the evergreen pruned bush is considered a symbol of revenge from the enemy
 rolling ne pustak main yah sthapit kiya he ki voldemort harry ke maathe par bane nishaan ke madhyam se uske saath jaadui rup se judaa tha
 The mark was formed on Harry's forehead when he cursed Harry and caused a reverse effect on him
 pustak tathaa filmon main yah dikhaaya gaya he ki harry kaa yah nishaan voldemort kii upasthiti kaa sanketak tha
 It hurts more when Anishtadeva was close to him or he shows an unkind or very happy feeling
 rolling ke anusaar navjaat harry par hamale ke samay voldemort ne harry ko maathe ke nishaan ke rup main apane dimag kii ek jaadui khidki use de di thi, jo kii doosraa koi jaadugar nahin karata he
 Many people began to compare Voldemort's character to some politicians
 rolling ne yah mana ki voldemort adolf hitler kaa "ek prakaar" tha
 Rolling has also compared Voldemort to the Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin
 harry potter or azkaaban kaa qaidi film ke nirdeshak alphonso kuoran ne voldemort kii tulana purv america raashtrapati jorge walker bush or iraq ke purv taanashaah saddaam hossain se kii he kyonki unke anusaar donon ke hit swaarthee the or donon hi shakti ke bhukhe the

 Children learn a lot in sports and games
 bachche kaa vikaas khel ke dwaara tab hoti jab khel bachche ko khushiyaan pradaan kaarti he
 If the children do not feel happy while playing the game, then the child does not develop from that game, but such a game will have a wrong effect on the child's development
 khel bacchaun ke maansik or shaarik vikaas me madad karti he
 Complete development of children through sports is possible only when the child is free from stress while playing
 khel do prakaar kaa hota he
 outdoor games
 ghar ke andar khele jane vaale khed
 The games which are played outside the house result in both physical and mental development of the child, but the game played at home only leads to mental development
 mere vichaar se khel kis bhi prakaar kaa ho bachche ko khushi pradaan kare vikaas nishit he
 Advantage Sports play an important role in the development of children
 khel se bacchaun ke maukhik-amaukhik vikaas hota he
 Sports help children's physical and mental development
 khel se bachche ek-dusre ke bhaavana ko samajhate or ek-dusre kaa aadar karne ke liye sikhte hai
 The game teaches children to live in harmony with each other
 khel bachche ke samaajik vikaas me madad karti
 Sports also help in the economic development of the child, because sometimes sports become the medium of economic income
 khel ke madhyam se baden ko bhi bachche ke ruchi bare main jaankaree milti he
 Sports help in disciplining children
 khel se bhaichara kaa bhaavana utpann hoti he
 The game provides concentration to the child
 nishkarshais lekh kaa saransh yah he ki bachche ke purna vikaas ke liy khel kaa mahatvapurn yogadan he
 The child gets physical, mental and social development through sports
 isliye bacchaun ko khelnaa kaa bharpur mauka dena chaiye parantu is baat kaa dhyaan avashya rakhana chaiye ki bachche khel main khushi mahasus kar rahen yaa nahin
 If the game provides happiness to the child, then the child is fully developed
 mata-pita ko avashya dhyaan dena chahaaye ki khel arthpurna ho or bachche ke hit ke liye ho

 The isosceles method is used to find the real root of the equation f = 0
 yadi yah falan interval main satat ho or f tathaa f ke chihn vipareet hon to a or b ko mul kaa 'bracket' kehete hai kyonki mul isi bich main kahin hoga
 In this method, the mid-point c = / 2 of the root-interval is extracted in this method
 phir f kaa maan nikaalte hai
 If f = 0, then c is the root of the equation, but it is very unlikely to happen
 ab yadi f or f ke chihn paraspar vipareet hai to mul kaa bracket hoga anyathaa hoga
 In this way, by repeatedly halving the bracket of the original, they eventually reach very close to the origin and the calculation is stopped
 mana ki samdvibhajan vidhi se nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa mul nikaalnaa he- First of all, we have to find two numbers a { \ displaystyle a} and b { \ displaystyle b} so that the values of f { \ displaystyle f} and f { \ displaystyle f} are inverted
 is falan ke liye, a = 1 { \ displaystyle a=1} tathaa b = 2 { \ displaystyle b=2} is shart ko puraa karte hai kyonki, And chunki falan satat he, isaliye mul interval ke bich main kahin hoga
 Now, let us find out the midpoint of this interval: is bindu par falan kaa maan he : f = 3 − − 2 = − 0
125 { \ displaystyle f=^{3}--2=-0
125} 
 yah maan rinatmak he
 This means that the original interval will be in the middle

 dhire-dhire inke shishyon kaa ek alag panth hi ban gaya, jo kuka panth kahalaaya
 Guru Ram Singh used to place great emphasis on cow protection, Swadeshi, women salvation, inter-caste marriage, mass marriage etc
 unhone bhi sarvapratham angreji shashan kaa bahishkar kar apni swatantra dak or prashasan vyavastha chalaayi thi
 Every year a fair was held in Bhaini village on Makar Sankranti
 1872 main meley main aate samay unke ek shishy ko musalamaanon ne gher liya
 They beat him and slaughtered him and put beef in his mouth

 khagoljeev vigyaan puure brahmand main jivan ke shuruyaat, failaav, kram vikaas or bhavishya ke adhyayan ko kehete hai
 This field of science tries to answer many difficult questions, such as - abhi tak vaigyanikon ko keval ek hi grah gyaat he jisapar jivan he: prithvi
 For this reason, inspired by this one example, he has imagined other places where life is possible
 haal hi main khoje gaye gair-saureey grahon se hamaare suraj ke alaava anya taron ke vaasayogy kshetron main bhi grahon ke milane kii ummiden jaagi hai, jis se yah lag rahaa he ke khagoljeev vigyaan sambhawatah ek nae daur kii dahleez par ho saktaa he
 "astronomy" is called "astrobiology" in English
 prithvi par jivan kaa adhyayan karke vaigyanikon ko ek paristhitiyon kii suchi to mil gayi he jo jivan ke anukool he
 Carbon is considered essential because its atoms have the ability to form long molecules
 vaise to vaigyanik anya tatwon kaa bhi jivan kaa aadhaar banane kii kalpana karte hai lekin carbon yah bhoomika bahut sahajata se nibhaataa he
 The presence of water is also considered important as it may contain different types of chemicals
 iskaa arth he ke jivan ke liye grah na to itnaa garam hona chahie ke pani sirf bhaap ke rup main hi ho or na hi itnaa sard ke sirf barf hi ke rup main mili
 Keeping these things in view, till now scientists considered the stars like the sun to be the savior of life-worthy planets, but recently the possibilities of meeting Earth-like planets around the red dwarf stars have started to appear because such stars are very long For kalos, you can put permanent conditions in planetary circles around you
 yah ek bahut hi ahm khoj he kyonki suraj-jaise taare brahmand main kam pratishat main milte hai, jabaki laal boune taron kii taadaad bahut hi zyada he
 Even if life on other planets is based on carbon and water, it cannot be said that there will be cells in their bodies as well, the rules of which will be based on DNA like the organisms of the earth
 yah sambhav he ke un jeevon main koi or vyavastha aadhaar ho
 As information about the spread of organisms on Earth has increased, scientists have found extinct creatures flourishing in places where life was once considered impossible
 kabhi sochaa jaataa tha ke gahare samudr ke tahon kii khaaiyon ke bhayankar dabaav main jeev nahin rah sakate
 It was also thought that organisms could not live in very high temperatures
 lekin pichley kuch dashakon main vaigyanikon ne gahare samudr main jwalamukheey garmi se khaulate hue pani or gas ke fawwaare paae hai jinamein charampasandi jeevanu punap rahe hai
 Astronomers believe that there is a sea of water beneath the icy surface of Europa, the natural satellite of Jupiter, the fifth planet of the solar system, which keeps on buzzing Jupiter's fierce tidal force
 sambhav he vahaan bhi aise garm pani ke kshetra or unamem panpate sookshmjeev hon
 Similarly, it was believed that organisms could not live in open space ether and in a radiation-prone environment, because their cells burst in them and their DNA deteriorates
 lekin ab risocarpan jyographicum jaise jeev paae ja chuke hai jo antariksh yaan dwaara vyom main le jaae gaye or 15 dinon ke baad prithvi par waapas laane par zindaa paae gaye
 With this, scientists are now beginning to suspect that it is possible that organisms can spread from one planet to another by meteorites
 kuch vaigyanik to yahan tak sochate hai ke shaayad prithvi par jivan shuru main isi tarah kisi or grah se aayaa ho
 In this fantasy, there could have been bacteria on another planet at some time, while the Earth was bereft of any life
 phir mangal par ek bada ulkapind padaa jis se mangal kii kuch badi chattaane udakar antariksh main chali gai or unamem se kuch prithvi kii ore bhi nikaleen
 When it reached the Earth, the Earth pulled them by its gravity and they themselves fell on the Earth as meteorites
 inamen kuch jeevanu jivit batch gaye jinhen prithvi kaa vaataavaran anukool laga or ve failane lage
 Other scientists make many mistakes in this fantasy and call it impossible

 In contrast, Chinese and Japanese speakers get the meaning of 'cat' by seeing the 猫 sign used in Chinese and the language, but speak it in different ways in their respective languages
 japani main ise 'neko' padhaa jaataa he or mandarin chini main ise 'maao' padhaa jaataa he
 Many people of Japan are able to derive a lot of meaning from it by reading Chinese newspaper without knowing a single word of Chinese
 vahi akhbaar agar unhen chini main pard ke sunaaya jaae to unhen kuch bhi samaj na aaye
 It is the same thing as seeing the sign of हिन्दी, the Hindi-speaking will say 'chhatri', the English-speaking will say 'umbrella' and the French-speaking 'paraplui'
 isi vajah se chinibhashi log aksar china main paae gaye hazaron saal puraane shilaalekh dekhakar unako kuch had tak samajhane main sakasham hote hai kyonki bahut se bhavchitra lambe arase se thode-thode pher-badal ke saath chale aa rahe hai
 Although expressions are used in Chinese script, many words are written by adding sounds related to these images
 aksar shabdon main ek bhavchitra arth kaa kuch andaaza detaa he or doosraa dhwani banane main sahaayak hota he
 Therefore the Chinese script is actually a mixed form of hieroglyph and sound-based script
 udhaaharan ke liye chini main 沖 ko 'chong' uccharit kiya jaataa he or iskaa arth he 'pani kaa tej bahaav yaa lahar'
 There are three small ridges on its left which means "water"
 yah pani se sambandhit anya shabdon main bhi pai jaati hai, jaise ki 河, 河 or 流 
 To the left of Chong, it is a drawing of water but to its right is a sign of जिसका which means 'beech' and is pronounced 'jong'
 jab in donon bhavchitron ko milakar 沖 likhaa jaataa he to pathak ko yah sanket he ki arth ke liye baayein taraf kaa chinh dekho or dhwani ke liye daayen taraf dekho
 So the reader understands that it is a word related to water which will be pronounced similar to 'jong'
 is se vah bhaanp jaataa he ki yah shabd 'chong' he
 Note that the meaning of the word Jong on the right side is not used at all and the sound related to the water on the left side is not used at all

 Singhasan Battisi is a collection of folklores
 prajavatsal, jananaayak, prayogvaadi evam doordarshee maharaja vikramaditya bhartiya lokkathaon ke ek bahut hi charchit paatr rahe hai
 There has been a very rich tradition of stories highlighting their qualities since ancient times
 singhaasana battisi bhi 32 kathaon kaa sangrah he jisamen 32 putaliyaan vikramaditya ke vibhinn gunon kaa katha ke rup main varnan karti hai
 Throne Battisi is originally a Hindi version of the Sanskrit work Throneadvatrinsati, which is also known as Dwatrinshatputalika
 sanskrit main bhi iske mukhyatah do sanskaran hai
 uttari sanskaran "singhasanadvatrinshati" ke naam se tathaa dakshini sanskaran "vikramcharita" ke naam se uplabdh he
 The earlier versions are called Kshemendra Muni
 bengal main vararuchi ke dwaara prastut sanskaran bhi isi ke samroop mana jaataa he
 Its southern form became more popular
 The throne Battisi also became very popular like Vetal Pachisi or Vetalpanchavanshati
 lokbhashaon main iske anuwaad hote rahe or puranic kathaon kii tarah bhartiya samaaj main maukhik parampara ke rup main rach-bas gaye
 These stories were composed after "vetalpanchvinshati" or "vatal Pachisi"
 But certainly nothing can be said about his creation
 itnaa lagbhag tay he ki inaki rachana dhara ke raja bhoj ke samay main nahin hui
 Since each legend mentions Raja Bhoja, its creation period will be after the 11th century
 in kathaon kii bhoomika bhi katha hi he jo raja bhoj kii katha kahati he
 32 stories are told from the face of 32 effigies which are enshrined in a throne
 yah singhaasana raja bhoj ko vicitra paristhiti main praapt hota he
 One day, Raja Bhoja realizes that a simple shepherd is known for his justice, while he is absolutely illiterate and pastorally feeds the cows, buffaloes and goats of the potters of his own kingdom
 jab raja bhoj ne tahaqiqaat karai to pataa chalaa ki vah charvaaha saare faisale ek tile par chadhakar karata he
 King Bhoja's curiosity grew and he disguised himself and saw the shepherd decide on a complicated matter
 uske faisle or aatmavishvaas se bhoj itnaa adhik prabhavit hue ki unhone usase uski is adwitiya kshamta ke bare main jaananaa chaha
 When the shepherd, whose name was Chandrabhan, told that this power comes to him automatically after sitting on the mound, Bhoja decided to deliberately carve the mound
 jab khudaai sampann hui to ek rajsinghaasana mitti main dabaa dikhaa
 This throne represented an unprecedented form of workmanship
 isamen battis putaliyaan lagi thim tathaa keemtee ratna jade hue the
 When the dust and mud were cleaned, the beauty of the throne was seen
 use uthaakar mahal laayaa gaya tathaa shubh muhoort main raja kaa baithna nishchit kiya gaya
 As the king tried to sit, all the effigies started ridiculing the king
 khilakhilaane kaa kaaran poochne par sari putaliyaan ek-ek kar vikramaditya kii kahani sunaane lageen tathaa boli ki is singhaasana jo ki raja vikramaditya kaa he, par baithne vaala uski tarah yogya, parakramee, daanveer tathaa vivekshil hona chahie
 These stories are so popular that many collectors have presented them in their own way
 sabhi sankalnon main putliyon ke naam die gaye hai par har sankalan main kathaon main kathaon ke kram main tathaa naamon main or unke kram main bhinnata pai jaati The order of names in a collection is as follows - ratnamanjari • chitralekha • chandrakala • kaamkandala • leelavati • ravibhama • kaumudi • pushpavati • madhumalati • prabhavati • trilochana • padmavati • kirtimati • sunayana • sundaravati • satyavati • vidyavati • taravati • ruparekha • gyaanavati • chandrajyoti • anurodhwati • dharmavati • karunavati • trinetri • mriganayani • malayavati • vaidehi • maanavati • jayalakshmi • kaushalya • rani rupavati • dekhen: singhaasana battisi • raja bhoj • }} nirdeshaank: 24°49′N 85°00′E / 24

leviticus 23:8 The modern English word Easter is derived from Old English words ईstre or Oistre or Oestar, which themselves developed before 899
 The name is related to Eostremonath, a month in the German calendar named after Eostre, the goddess of anglo-saxon idolatry, attested by Beed
 bid ne mana ki iostr-monath kaa maheenaa darasal april main hota he or ye bhi ki iostr-monath ke dauraan hi devi ke sammaan main kiya jane vaala utsav hi samay ke saath dhire dhire khatm hua or unke lekhankaal ke aate aate vahi utsav isaiyon ke easter ke rup main janaa jane laga

 The influence of the goddess has had some impact on the theories given by scholars to discuss whether the Eostar is a discovery of Bead, what are the principles associated with the Eostar in the records relating to the customs of the German people and the origin of the name On the basis of the descendants of the goddess of proto-indo-european dawn
 Ostara, reconstructed by Grimm, has some influence on modern popular culture
 german aadhunik main ostarn he, lekin anyathaa, german bhashaa aam taur par paska rup se udhaar lee hui he
 The Greek word Πάσχα and its Latin form Paska are derived from the Hebrew true word meaning feast of Pascha
 פֶּסַח In Greek the word Ανασταση, is also used as an alternative
 arabi yaa anya sami bhashaaon ko bolne vaale isai aam taur par sach ke samajaat shabd kaa prayog karte he
 For example, the second word for the Arabic name for the celebration عيد الفصحʿ Īd al-fiṣḥ is from the root F-S-H, which is when Arabic pronunciation or phonetic rules are equivalent to the Hebrew P-S-H in which h is the modern Hebrew and / ħ / is known as / x / in Arabic
 arabi main shabd عيد القيامةʿīd al-qiyāmah kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he jiskaa arth he- "mritotthana kaa tyohaar "," lekin ye shabd zyada aam nahin he
 In Maltese it is el Ghid in the word

 In most Slavic languages, Easter means either "great Day" or "great Night"
 For example, Velkanok, Velka Nok and Velikonosé mean "great Night" or "great Nights" in Polish, Slovak and Jake respectively
 Велигден { / 0,} Великдень, Великден, and Вялікдзень {0 { / 0} mean "great Day" in Macedonians, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Belarusian respectively
 jabaki kroeshian or srbian main is din ke naam kaa ek vishisht dharmik sambandh dikhataa he: ise uskars kaha jaataa he, yani "mritotthana"
 kroeshian main ise vazam kaha jaataa he, jo puraane carch kii slowenik kriya vazeti se utpann hui ek sangya he
 It also explains the truth that Serbian Easter is sometimes called Vaskars, which derives from an accented form similar to that inherited in the repetition of the Slavonic Church
 puraatan kaal kaa shabd velja nok kroeshian main istemaal kiya jaataa tha jabaki shabd veliden srbian main istemaal kiya gaya tha
 It is believed that Cyril and Methodias, the "holy brothers", who purified the Slavic peoples and translated Christian books from Greek to Old Church Slavonic, invented uskars from the words Krasnuti and "enliven"
 yah dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki in bhashaaon main upsarg velic pavitra saptaah or easter ke pehle ke aakhri daavat vaale teen dinon ke naam kii jagah istemaal kiya gaya he

 The first Christians, Jews and idolaters were certainly aware of the Hebrew calendar Acts 2: 112: 320: 627: 91 Cor 16: 8, but there is no firm evidence that they specifically celebrated any annual Christian festival
 Ho
 According to the custom of Christians, some believe that the annual festival celebrated by non-christians is a Navrati that came after the Dharmasana era of Rome

 Although when we read it on the basis of context, it is not the exclusion or contempt of a festival - which, considering its legitimacy in the time of Scholasticus - is surprising - but it is only different methods of computing its date
 Surf is a part of defense
 vastav main, haalanki unhone easter ke jashn ko vahaan kii sthaneey reeti se janma hua kaha, unhone is paat par jor diya ki is tyohaar ko puri duniya swayan dekh rahi he
 Perhaps the earliest extant primary source referring to Easter was in the midst of the second book, according to the Paschal-themed Sardes, by Melito as a theological sentence
 duusari shatabdi ke baad tak, is baat ko sweekaara gaya ki paska kaa utsav maananaa anuyaayiyon kii ek pratha or ek nirvivaad parampara thi
 The Quartodeciman controversy, which is the first of many controversies over Pascal / Easter, then arose as to which date Pascha should be celebrated
 shabd " quartodesiman" hebrew calendar ke anusaar nisaan 14 ko saanchaa:lordpaska yaa easter manaane ke tareeke ko bataata hamedavitichus 23:5
 carch ke itihaaskaar usbiyas ke anusaar, quartodesiman policarp ne enisetus ke saath milakar is sawaal par charchaa kii
 asia kaa roman praant quartodesiman tha jabaki roman or alexendrian charchon main upwas ravivaar tak chalata tha jisamen easter ko ravivaar se jodakar dekha jaataa tha
 Neither Polycarp nor Anicetus could persuade each other about this, but they did not consider the matter to be fragmented and left to be solved without questioning
 vivaad tab paidaa hua jab rome ke bishop victor jo ki enisetus ke ek peedi baad aaye the unhone ifesus ke policrates or quartodesiman ke liye asia ke sabhi bishopon ko bahishkrut karne kaa prayaas kiya
 According to Eusebias, many religious gatherings were called to resolve the dispute, according to which all of the gatherings supported Easter on Sunday itself
 jabaki asia kii quartodesiman kii puraatanta kaa bachaav karte hue policrates ne victor ko likhaa
 victor dwaara bahishkaar karne kaa prayaas spasht taur par nirast kar diya gaya or donon paksh bishop ireneius ke hastkshep par sahamat ho gaye jinhone victor ko enisetus ke sahishnu udhaaharan ko yaad dilaayaa
 The Quartodeciman appears to have lasted until the fourth century, when Socrates of Constantinople recognized that some Quartodecimano were being deprived of their churches by John Chrysostom and persecuted by Nestorias
 yah gyaat nahin he ki nisaan 14 kii parampara kab tak chali
 lekin nisaan 14 ko maanane vaale donon hi paksh or wo jo easter ko anugami ravivaar ke din maanate the, sabhi main ek aam reeti thi ye ki nisaan kis kaa maheenaa kab padegaa ye jaanane ke liye ve apane yahudee padosiyon se madad lete the or usee ke anusaar utsav kaa din tay karte the
 In the late part of the third century, some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with the belief that the Jewish community was being trusted to set the date for Easter
 sabase badi shikaayat ye thi kii yahudee samudaay kai baar galati se paska kaa din is tarah tay karata tha ki wo uttari golardh ke vasant-vishuv se bhi pehle pad jaataa tha
 Anatolias of Laodicea wrote during the last part of the third century: jo varsh ke pehle chandra maas ko vasant-vishuv ke pehle barahave raashi chakra main rakhkar paska kaa chaudahawa din tay karte hai wo darasal ek bahut badi or asaadhaaran galati karte hai
 Alexander's bishop Peter had the same complaint
 vishuv ke baad bilkul sateekta se dekhe ja rahe maheene ke chaudaave din, pracheen log divine aadesh ke anusaar paska manaate the
 Whereas the people of the present age now celebrate it before the equinox and this is all due to carelessness and mistake
 sardika paska-vishyak talika in sabhi shikayaton kii pushti karti hai
 This suggests that Jews from a city in the eastern Mediterranean Sea on Nisan 14 March 11 328 BC
 In, 334 BC on 5 March
 In, 337 BC on 2 March
 In and on March 10, 339 BC In the spring just before the equinox
 yahudee calendar par vishwaas karne se asantushti ke kaaran kuch isaiyon ne swatantra sanganana kaa prayog karnaa shuru kar diya
 lekin kuch logon ko aisa laga ki yahudiyon kii salaah par chali aa rahi prathagat kriya ko aage jari rakhana chahie bhale hi isaki sanganana main truti hi kyon na ho
 apostolic samvidhanon kaa ek sanskaran, jiskaa audiyani sampradaay ke logon dwaara prayog main laayaa jaataa tha, usamen yah salaah di gai he ki: Do not do your computation by yourself, instead look at Pascha when your brothers are also suffering from this problem
 If they make a mistake, then you do not mind
 do anya shankaaen, jinke kaaran kuch isaiyon ko shayaad yahudee samaaj se easter kii tithi kaa nirdhaaran karne kii prakriya ko jari rakhane main aapatti thi
 These doubts, in the absence of Bishop, at the Council of Nicaea, Constantin described in his letter: yah ek ayogy baat dikhaai padati he ki is sabase bade pavitra parv ke utsav main hamen yahudiyon kii parampara kaa paalan karnaa chahie


 hamaare liye iskaa anupaalan hona hamaari shakti ke daayre main he, agar ham unki reeti kaa parityag kar den, taaki ek sachche aadesh dwaara bhavishya ke aane vaale yugon main is vidhaan ke anupaalan ko sthagit kiya ja sake


 unke apane ghamand ke liye yah vastav main ek haasyaaspad baat he ki unke anudeshon ke bina ham in chizon kaa avlokan karne kaa samarthy nahin rakhte hai
 

 Being completely unconcerned with the correct solution to this question, sometimes they get Pascha to be twice a year
 ek hi varsh main do baar paska ko manaane kaa udhaaharan shaayad us samay ke dauraan yahudee calendar main maujuud bhugolic vividhta ke kaaran ho sakati he, jiskaa kaaran tha puure samrajya main sanchaar kaa badi maatr main tutaa hona
 ek shahar ke yahudee duusare shahar ke yahudiyon se paska kaa nirdhaaran shaayad alag tareeke se karte honge
 yahudiyon ke "ghamand" kaa udhaaharan or, vastav main is puure ansh main kadave yahudee-virdohi swar, ek or mudde ko sujhaate hai: kuch isaiyon ne sochaa ki isaiyon ke liye ye baat shobhaneey nahin he ki ek isaai parv kii tithi tay karne ke liye yahudiyon par ashrith rahaa jaae
 This dispute between the advocates of independent computations and those who wanted to continue the practice of relying on the Jewish calendar, as resolved by the First Council of Nicaea in 325, who supported this move to independent computation, effectively The need to abandon the old practice of consultation with the Jewish community in those places where it was still used
 This dispute, in which some advocated independent computations and some wanted to pursue the practice of being dependent on the Jewish calendar, was formally settled at the First Assembly of Nicaea in 325, this assembly supported independent computations They did and asked to effectively abandon the places where the old practice of consultation by Jewish communities was still going on
 The fact that the sermon and authentic scriptures are against it indicates that the old tradition is not finished at all, kuch itihaaskaaron kaa kahana he ki 4 veen sadi ke madhya ke roman adhikariyon ne nisine ke nirnay ko lagu karne ke prayaas main yahudee calendar main dakhal dene kii koshish kii he
 This principle Developed by Liebermann and replicated in S
 Safrae's ben-sasson History of the Jeevish People
 jahaan tak yahudee maamalon par 4 veen sadi ke madhya ke roman kanoon ki baat he is drushtikon ko koi samarthan nahin mila
 itihaaskaar prokopias ne apane gupt itihaas yaa sikret history main yah daawa kiya he ki samraat jastinan ne 6 veen shatabdi main yahudee calendar main dakhal dene kii koshish kii or ek aadhunik lekhak ne yah suzav diya he ki unka aisa karnaa shaayad protopaskitis ke khilaaf unka ek kadam tha

 saanchaa:dates for easteristara or usase judy hui chhuttia gatisheel tyohaar hai, isamen ye gregorian yaa julian calendar ke anusaar ek nishchit tithi par nahin hoti hai 
 iske bajaaye, easter kii tithi chandra-saura calendar ke anusaar nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 This lunisolar calendar is similar to the Hebrew calendar
 pashchimi isai dharm main, gregorian calendar ke prayog ke anusaar, easter sanyukt rup se hameshaa 22 march or 25 april ke bich ravivaar ko padataa he
 The following day, Easter Monday, is a legal holiday in many countries with predominantly Christian traditions
 purvi roodhiwaadee girijaghar main jisane dharmik dinon ko nikaalane ke liye julian calendar kaa prayog karnaa jari rakhaa hua he
 Easter also falls jointly on Sundays between 22 March and 25 April according to this calendar
 gregorian calendar ke anusaar, 1900 or 2099 ke bich 13 din kaa antar hone kii vajah se ye tithiyaan 4 april or 8 may ko sanyukt rup se padati hai
 Some churches among the Eastern Orthodox have replaced the Julian to Gregory calendar and date for Easter and other fixed and movable celebrations similar to the Western Church
 easter kii sateek taarikh kai baar vivaad kaa vishay rahaa he
 In 325, it was decided at the First Council of Nicea that all Christians would celebrate Easter on the same day, which would be decided independently of any Jewish calculation that determined the date of Pascha
 However it is possible that no way to set the date was decided by the council
 4 thi shatabdi ke madhya main salaamis ke epiphenias ne likhaa tha: In the years following the Council, the system of computations emitted by the Church of Alexandria became regulatory
 alexendria ke niyamon ko puure isai europe main apanaaye jane main kuch vakt laga
 jabaki, rome ke carch teesri shatabdi ke uttarardh se lekar 457 tak ek 84 saal kaa lunisolar yaa chandra-surya calendar chakra hi prayog karte rahe
 rome ke carch ne 6 veen shatabdi tak apni khud ki paddatiyon kaa hi prayog jari rakhaa jabaki wo alexendriyan paddati ke anusaar dionaysius exiguus dwaara julian calendar main badale gaye niyam bhi apana sakate the 
 britain or ireland main bhi praarambhik isaiyon ne teesri shatabdi ke uttarardh kaa 84 saal vaala roman chakra prayog kiya
 During the 7th and 8th centuries, the method of Alexandria took its place
 During the reign of Charlmagne, churches in western continental Europe used the Old Roman method until the late 8th century, and then eventually adopted the Alexandrian method
 However, with the adoption of the Gregorian calendar by the Catholic Church in 1582 and the continued use of the Julian calendar by the Eastern Orthodox and most Oriental Orthodox churches, the date of celebrating Easter again deviated, and this deviation or difference exists to this day
 4 thi sadi se hi niyam yahi kahata he ki easter ravivaar ko yaa vasant vishuv ke din ke baad aane vaali pehali poornima ke baad aane vaale pehle ravivaar ko manaaya jaataa he 
 jabaki, yah girijaghar ke vaastavik niyamon ko thik pratibimbit nahin karata
 iskaa ek kaaran yah he ki isamen poornima kaa matlab darasal khagoleey poornima nahin he, balki ye ek chandra masik calendar kaa 14 waan din he
 Another difference is that the spring equinox of astronomy is a natural astronomical event, which may fall on 19, 20 or March 21, while in the church the date is set to 21 March
 girijaghar ke niyamon ko lagu karne main, isai carch 21 march ko easter kii tithi nirdhaarit karne kaa shuruaati bindu maanate hai jiske baad se wo agali poornima kii gananaa karte hai, aadi

 The starting point in determining the date of Orthodox Easter by him is also March 21, but according to the Julian calculation, which falls on April 3 in the Gregorian calendar
 iske atirikt, julian calendar ke anusaar chandramaa kii talika gregory calendar se 4 din peeche he
 According to the Gregory system, the 14th day of the lunar month will be the 9th or 10th day according to Julian

 Accordingly, Grigorian Easter may fall on 35 possible dates between March 22 and April 25
 aakhri baar ye 1818 main 22 march ko padaa tha or ab 2285 tak dobaaraa ye us taarikh ko nahin padegaa
 2008 main yah 23 march ko padaa tha lekin 2160 tak ab ye dobaaraa us taarikh ko nahin padegaa
 easter pichley naveenatam sambhav taarikh, par gir gaya or agle main us taarikh par gir jaaegi
 aakhri baar easter 25 april ko 1943 main padaa tha or agali baar is taarikh ko ye saal 2038 main hi padegaa

 a lunar-solar calendar is also used to set the date of the Jewish Pascha, and because Easter always falls on a Sunday, it usually occurs exactly one week after the first day of Pascha
 jabaki, hebrew or grigorian chakra ke bich niyamon ke antar ke anusaar paska 19 varsh ke chakra main prayek 3 saal par easter ke ek maheene baad padataa he
 It falls in Grigorian's 19-year cycle of 3,11 and 14 years
