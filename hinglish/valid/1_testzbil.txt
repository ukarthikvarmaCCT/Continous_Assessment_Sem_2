 In 1993, it was estimated to be about 2,20,000 speakers
 'koh' farsi bhashaa kaa ek shabd he jiskaa matlab 'parvat' hota he
 In other indo-iranian languages, the same word is found in Pashto as 'ghar', in ancient Avastai language as 'garry' and in Sanskrit as 'giri'
 kohistaan zile main bahut se pahaad hai, jis se yah shabd aayaa he
 The Pashtun people of khyber-pakhtunkhwa sometimes call all non-pashtun people of this area as 'kohistani'
 british raaj ke dauraan hue ek samikshan ne paaya ki 'inhen or hindu-kush kii vaadiyon ke sabhi bhartiya musalamaanon ko pathan kohistaani bulaate hai'
 For this reason, the languages spoken in the same region are Kalmi and Torvali, sometimes called Kohistani, although from a linguistic point of view they are two Dardi languages different from indus-kohistan

 iske pratinidhi eckoshikeey, anek aakaar prakaar tathaa rup ke hote hai
 Just as small pieces of kach appear in many forms in the general polymorphism, there are also diatom groups similar to those forms
 prayek diatem kii koshika prachur silikayukta tathaa is banaavat kii hoti he maano do petri dish ek duusare main satakar band rakhe hon
 When each diatom is examined from the upper fold, its bipartite, or aerial symmetry marks appear to be obvious
 koshika ke bheetar ek athwa anek, vividh aakaar ke bhure pile se varnakilvak hote hai
 Diatoms are classified based on the cell's outer cell
 prayek diatem kii donon koshikabhitiyaan, aantarik praras sahit, frastul kehalaati hai
 The upper cell wall is called the epitheca and the inner hypothyca, and the silicous portion of both is almost as wide as the balves, with flanges that are bordered by the equilateral connective band or cingulum
 yah sanyoji band valb ke saath praaia: achche prakaar se judaa hota he
 Sometimes there is more than one connective band
 ye aantareey band kehalaate hai
 When looking at the frstule from the end of the valve, the valve bottom and the valve band are seen when looking from the connective band
 kupin ke matanusaar vah padaarth jiske dwaara frastul silikamay ho jaataa he, aluminium silicket he
 According to Pearsal, the abundance of silicate salts in the water medium helps in reproduction
 valve main jo silicy padaarth ekatrit hota he, vah kendrik diatem main ek kendriya bindu ke chaaron ore areey samamit hota he
 In pinnate diatoms it can be bilateral symmetric or asymmetric with axial plaque
 kuch samudri kendrik diatmon main takshan paryaapt khurdura sa hota he
 This is especially due to Yatra Tatra Gartrom
 in gartaromon main baarik khadi naal rupi chhidr hote hai
 Some Pinellies diatoms may have one or more true holes, which, according to Géminehart, are central or polar
 ye patale sthal, jinhen pankati kehete hai, kataron main vinyasat tathaa valve kii lambaai ke saath jaati hui lanbaayman pattica, jise aksheeya kshetra kah sakate hai, dwiparshvik rup main hote hai
 These axial regions may be even in texture, or may have a long furrow, raphe
 lambii zairi se rahit aksheeya kshetra kuta raafe kehalaata he
 The axial regions of both valves of a frustule are often similar, although some genera may contain Raf in one and the code in the other
 prayek raafe ke madhya main bhitti ke sthulan se ek kendriya granthi ban jaati he or donon siron par praaia: dhruvagranthiyaan bhi hoti hai
 The protoplast within the frustule first consists of a fold of cytoplasm, which contains one or several pigments
 cytoplasm ke or bheetar ek spasht riktika ke madhyabhaag ke kuch cytoplasm main ek gol sa nabhik sthit rahata he
 There can be many types of pigmentation
 inhen main pirinaayed maujuud hote hai, athwa nahin bhi hote
 Pigments are often of golden color
 surakshit bhojya saamagree praaia: vasa he
 The diatoms containing Rafe are moving
 inaki gati lambey aksh par jatke se hoti he
 These tremors occur one after the other
 kuch aage bad jane par vaise hi ek jatke se diatem ruk jaataa he or pun: peeche kii ore aata he
 According to Müller, this motion of the diatom is caused by currents in the cytoplasm
 diatem main koshikavibhaajan bhi hota he
 In this activity, two progeny cells are formed, which are naturally smaller and larger
 nabhikavibhaajan ke saath hi varnakan bhi vibhajit hote hai
 As a result of cell division, one portion of the protoplast remains inside the epithelium and the other in the hypotheca
 iske uparaant prayek santati ansh main duusari ore kii koshikabhithti nirmit hokar, do nae diatem taiyaar ho jate hai
 It can be inferred that the newly formed half will always be hypothyca and the old residual part, whether it was previously epithica or hypothica, will always be apotheca in this new diatom
 isse ek kalpana yah bhi kii ja sakati he ki is prakaar prayek vibhaajan ke falswaroop koshikaaye dhire dhire aakaar main choti hoti jaayengi parantu asal main aage chalakar chote aakar kii naveen koshikaaye oxospore banakar, pun: praarambhik aakaar kii koshikaon ko utpann kar detii he
 These auxospores are formed by the conjugation of two cells in the pinnailis
 do koshikaon ke sanyugman se do oxonspore ban jaaen, yaa do koshikaaye aapas main ek chol main sat jaaen or prayek bina sanyugman ke hi ek ek oxospore nirmit kar de, athwa keval ek koshika se ek oxospore ban jaae, yaa ek koshika se do oxospore bhi ban ja sakate hai
 Small vasicles are also produced in the Centreles class
 inaki sankhya ek koshika ke bheetar 4, 8, 16 ke kram se 128 tak ho jaati he
 According to Karsten and Schmidt these small spores are formed as a result of formation and then division in cytoplasm
 gitler ke matanusaar yah kriya ardhasuthran par aadhaarit he
 These small spores also contain flagella
 anek kendrik diatmon main moti bhittiyukt ek or prakaar ke bijaanu hote hai, jinhen statospore kehete hai
 The classification of diatoms is mainly based on the classification of the shot
 isamen mukhya tathy koshikatkshan kii vibhinnata he
 Diatoms are found in large numbers in fossil form, even this mass has been termed as diatom clay
 in fossil diatmon ke liye bhi yah vargeekaran upyukt he
 Most fossil diatoms do not belong to the pre-cretaceous era
 inaki prachur sankhya evam maatra centameriya oel fields, california main praapt hui he
 These fossils are spread in 700 feet thick folds, which are miles long
 fossil diatmon kii mitti vyavsaayik drushti se mahatvapurn he
 It is useful in polishing silver and is also suitable for adsorbing liquid nitroglycerin, allowing dynamite to be transferred more safely
 aaj lagbhag 60% diatem mrittika chini parishkaranshaalaon main dravon ko chaanane ke kaam main aati he
 In addition, this clay is also used in the manufacture of paints and varnishes etc
 to a certain extent
 vatya bhatthiyon main, jahaan taap atyadhik hota he, diatem mrittika ooshmaarodhi ke rup main bhi prayukt kii jaati he
 Is the normal temperature 600 degrees C? It is completely successful as an insulator till heat
 saamaajik parivartan, samaaj ke aadharbhoot parivartanon par prakaash daalane vaala ek vistrut evam kathin vishay he
 In this process, a new birth takes place in the structure and functioning of society
 iske antargat multah prasthiti, varg, str tathaa vyavhaar ke anekanek pratimaan banate evam bigadate hai
 Society is dynamic and change is inevitable over time
 aadhunik sansar main prayek kshetra main vikaas hua he tathaa vibhinn samaajon ne apane tareeke se in vikaason ko samahit kiya he, unka uttar diya he, jo ki saamaajik parivartanon main parilakshith hota he
 The pace of these changes has been rapid at times
 kabhi-kabhi ye parivartan ati mahatvapurn rahe hai to kabhi bilkul mahatvaheen
 Some changes are accidental, beyond our imagination and some that were predicted
 kuch se talmail bithaana saral he jab ki kuch ko sahaj hi swikaarna kathin he
 Some social changes are obvious and visible while some cannot be seen, they can only be experienced
 ham adhiktar parivartanon kii prakriya or parinaamon ko jane samajhe bina avchetan rup se inamen shaamil rahe hai
 While many times these changes have been imposed on us against our will
 kai baar ham parivartanon ke mook sakshi bhi bane hai
 Due to attachment to the system, the human mind is initially suspicious of these changes but silently accepts them
 vadh dal Under social change, we mainly study three facts - saamaajik parivartan ke arth ko spasht karne ke liye kuch pramukh paribhaashaon par vichaar karenge
 Makiwar and Page have explained the social change in their book Society, that as sociologists we have a direct relationship with social relations and the change that we bring will be called social change
 davis ke anusaar saamaajik parivartan kaa taatpary saamaajik sanghathan arthath samaaj kii sanrachana evam prakaaryon main parivartan he
 HM Johnson explained social change in very brief and meaningful terms and stated that social change in the original sense means structural change
 johnson kii tarah gidence ne bataaya he ki saamaajik parivartan kaa arth buniyadi sanrachana yaa buniyadi sanstha main parivartan se he
 With respect to the above definitions, it can be said that change is a broad process
 samaaj ke kisi bhi kshetra main vichlan ko saamaajik parivartan kaha ja saktaa he
 Divergence does not mean bad or antisocial here
 saamaajik, aarthik, raajnneetik, dharmik, naitik, bhautik aadi sabhi kshetron main hone vaale kisi bhi prakaar ke parivartan ko saamaajik parivartan kaha ja saktaa he
 This deviation may be by nature itself or as planned by human society
 parivartan yaa to samaaj ke samast dhaanche main aa saktaa he athwa samaaj ke kisi visheksh paksh tak hi simit ho saktaa he
 Change is an all-time event
 yah kisi-na-kisi rup main hameshaa chalane vaali prakriya he
 Sociologists are not yet unanimous on the question of why and how change happens
 isliye parivartan jaisi mahatvapurn kintu jatil prakriya kaa arth aaj bhi vivaad kaa ek vishay he
 What will be the pace of change in any society, it depends on the reasons for the change existing in that society and what is the relative importance of those reasons in the society
 saamaajik parivartan ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye yahan isaki pramukh visheshtaon kii charchaa apekshit he
 The following are the features
 vilbert i mor ne aadhunik samaaj ko dhyaan main rakhte hue saamaajik parivartan kii visheshtaon kii charchaa apane dhang se kii he, ve hai- Some sociologists say that there are some main sources of social change
 ye is prakaar hai- The process of social change manifests in many forms, such as growth, progress, development, social movement, revolution etc
 chunki in saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa saamaajik parivartan se sidhaa sambandh he yaa kabhi-kabhi in sambandhon ko saamaajik parivartan kaa paryaayavachi mana jaataa he, isliye in shabdon ke arth ke sambandh main kaaphi ulajhanein hai
 The following are their explanations
 ‘udvikas’ shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle jeevigyaan ke kshetra main charles darwin ne kiya tha
 According to Darwin, in the process of evolution, the structure of an organism moves easily from complexity to complexity
 yah prakriya prakritik chayan ke siddhanth par aadhaarit he
 Early sociologist Herbert Spencer has considered social change as possible due to some internal forces, like biological change, and has said that the process of growth gradually progresses through certain levels
 udvikas kii avadharana ko spasht karte hue makiver evam pej ne likhaa he ki udvikas ek kism kaa vikaas he
 But not every development is a development because there is a definite direction of development, but there is no definite direction of development
 kisi bhi kshetra main vikaas karnaa udvikas kaha jayega
 Makiver and Page have stated that development is not just in size but also in structure
 yadi samaaj ke aakaar main vruddhi nahin hoti he or vah pehle se zyada aantarik rup se jatil ho jaataa he to use udvikas kahenge
 When change happens in the direction of good, we call it progress
 pragati saamaajik parivartan kii ek nishchit disha ko darshata he
 In progress, a sense of social welfare and collective interest is hidden
 ogaberne evam nimacof ne bataaya he ki pragati kaa arth achchhai ke nimitt parivartan he
 Hence progress is the desired change
 iske madhyam se ham purv-nirdhaarit lakshyon ko paanaa chaahate hai
 Makiwar and Page have warned that we should not use growth and progress in the same sense
 donon bilkul alag-alag avadharanaayen hai
 Just as the meanings of evolution are not very clear and definite, the concept of development is also not very clear
 samajashastreey pariprekshya main vikaas kaa arth saamaajik vikaas se he
 Early sociologists, especially Kaunt, Spencer and Hobhouse, used 'social evolution', 'progress', and 'social development' in the same sense
 aadhunik samajashastri in shabdon ko kuch vishesh arth main hi istemaal karte hai
 Today, in the field of sociology, we mean development mainly from social development
 iskaa prayog visheshkar udyogikaran evam aadhunikeekaran ke chalate viksit evam vikasshil deshon ke bich antar spasht karne ke liye hota he
 The sense of economic development is also hidden in social development and under this we discuss traditional society, transitive society and modern society
 aadhunik shiksha kaa vikaas bhi ek prakaar kaa saamaajik vikaas he
 In the same way, moving from social system based on agriculture to social system based on industry will also be called social development
 duusare shabdon main, samantvaad se poonjeewaad kii ore janaa bhi ek prakaar kaa vikaas he
 The social movement has been a very important factor in social change
 visheshkar dakiyanoosee samaaj main saamaajik aandolanon ke dwaara kaaphi parivartan aae hai
 According to Giddens, the collective movement is an attempt by individuals that has a common purpose and, in order to fulfill the objective, people try to change their traditional system by organizing in their own way without resorting to institutional social rules
 gidence ne kaha he ki kabhi-kabhi aisa lagata he ki saamaajik aandolan or aupchaarik sanghathan ek hi tarah kii chijen hai, par donon bilkul bhinn hai
 There are no rules like bureaucratic system under social movement, whereas formal system has more bureaucratic rules and laws
 itnaa hi nahin donon ke bich uddeshyon kaa bhi fark hota he
 In the same way, Kabir Panth, Arya Samaj, Bahmo Samaj or the recent backward class movement can be called a social movement
 aupchaarik vyavastha nahin
 Revolution is a stronger medium of social change than social movement
 kranti ke dwaara saamaajik parivartan ke anginat udhaaharan maujuud hai
 But in the last two-three centuries, there have been many, big revolutions in human history, which have brought epoch-making changes in political, economic and social fields in some nations
 is sandarbh main 1775-83 kii america kranti evam 1789 kii francisi kranti vishesh rup se ulalekhneey hai
 Today, due to these revolutions, freedom, social equality and democracy are talked about in the whole world
 usee tarah se roosi kranti or chini kranti kaa vishwa str par apana hi mahatv he
 Abrams has stated that most revolutions in the world have taken place for fundamental social reconstruction
 ariend ke anusaar krantiyon kaa mukhya uddeshy paramparaagat vyavastha se apane-aapako alag karnaa evam naye samaaj kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 An exception to this is sometimes seen in history
 kuch aisi bhi krantiyaan hui hai, jinke dwaara ham samaaj ko or bhi puraatan samay main le jane kii koshish karte hai
 The Daban Necropolis is a necropolis on the west bank of the Nile River, opposite Thebes in Upper Egypt
 yah faronic kaal ke liye vishesh rup se nae samrajya ke dauraan anushthan dafan ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Proteomics is the science related to the study of proteins found in organism cells
 isamen proteinon kaa vibhinn avasthaaon main, ek hi samay main, tathativr gati se vishleshan kara jaataa he
 This can map the endocytosis of proteins into cells
 jeev sharir main anek prakaar ke protein hote hai
 Proteins have long chains of amino acids, and they are made up of 20 different amino acids
 prayek amino amla ke rasinic gun bhinn hote hai, tathaa unka vibhinn proteinon main hone vaala anukram bhi bhinn hota he
 Because of this, each protein is a specially structured and this structure is suitable in every way for its function
 protein kisi jeev kii jivan kshamta or koshikeey kriyavidhi ke liye sidhe sidhe uttaradaayi hote hai
 The importance of genes and genomes in biology is like the foundation of a building
 atah jinom pariyojna ke dwaara milane vaali soochna ati mahatvapurn hoti he
 The progress made in proteomics method will help us to know how different diseases arise and how new drugs can be made to work against them
 is prakaar proteomix kaa upyog kisi rog se sambandhit protein kii pahchaan karne main kiya jaataa he, jise ham "rog sanketak" kehete hai
 Proteomics is also heavily used to understand diseases like cancer, heart disease, and to study any nutritional level
 vanaspati shaastra main proteomix vidhi kisi paudhe or prajati ke lakshanon kaa varnan karne, ek prakaar ke paudhe main anuvanshik bhinnata kaa anumaan lagane tathaa paryaavarniya tanaav se prabhavit proteinon kii pahchaan main upyogi dekhi gai he
 Therefore, in the future, biology research will get a new direction from proteomics and it will get an influential place in human disease related research

 Template: Nationalism sidebar rashtrawaad ek jatil, bahuaiami avadharana he, jisamen apane raashtra se ek sajhi sampradayik pahchaan samaveshit he
 It is expressed as a political ideology oriented toward communal autonomy, and sometimes sovereignty, and sometimes sovereignty over an area of historical importance to a group
 iske atirikt, sajhi visheshtaon, jinamein aam taur par samskruti, bhashaa, dharm, raajnneetik lakshya or / athwa aam pitravali main ek aasthaa sammilit hai, par aadhaarit ek aam sampradayik pahchaan ke vikaas or rakrakhaav kii ore, yah or unmukh hai
 a person's membership within the nation, and his support of related nationalism, are characterized by his concomitant national identity
 kisi raajnneetik yaa samajashastreey drushtikon se, rashtrawaad ke udgamon or aadhaaron ko samajhane ke liye lagbhag teen mukhya roopawaliyaan hai
 The first, alternatively known as primitiveism or sustainabilityism, is an approach that describes nationalism as a naturalistic view
 is mat kii yah dharna he ki yadhyapi rashtratv avadharana kaa aupchaarik granthan aadhunik ho, par raashtra hameshaa se astitv main rahe hai
 The second model is that of ethnocentrism, which is a complex approach, contextualizing nationalism as a dynamic, revolutionary view throughout history, and as a result of subjective relations, from national symbols steeped in historical meaning, of a collective nation
 By further examining the power of nationalism, we try to explain nationalism
 teesri, or sabase haaavee roopavali hai aadhuniktawaad, jo rashtrawaad ko ek haal ke drugvishay ke rup main varnit karti hai, jise astitv ke liye aadhunik samaaj kii sanrachanaatmak paristhitiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti hai
 What constitutes a nation, there are many definitions for it, however, which lead to many different varieties of nationalism
 yah vah aasthaa ho sakati hai ki ek rajya main naagarikta kisi ek sanjateey, saanskrithik, dharmik yaa pahchaan samooh tak simit honi chahien, yaa vah ho sakati hai ki kisi akele rajya main bahurashtriyata main aavashyak rup se alpsankhyakon dwaara bhi rashtriya pahchaan ko abhivyakt karne or prayog karne kaa adhikaar sammilit hona chahien
 The adoption of national identity in terms of historical development has generally been the result of a response by influential groups unsatisfied with traditional identities due to inconsistency between their defined social order and the experience of that social order by its members, resulting in a situation of anomie that nationalists seek to resolve
 This anomie results in a society or societies reinterpreting identity, retaining elements that are considered acceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, in order to create a unified community
 This development may be the result of internal structural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are perceived to be controlling them
 rashtriya dhvaj, raashtragan or rashtriya pahchaan ke anya pratik rashtriya samudaay ke ucch rup se mahatvapurn pratik aam taur par maane jate hai
 Nationalism is the name of the faith of a group of people under which they consider themselves united on the basis of shared history, tradition, language, ethnicity and culture
 inhen bandhanon ke kaaran ve is nishkarsh par pahonchte hai ki unhen aatm- nirnay ke aadhaar par apane samprabhu raajnneetik samudaay arthath ‘raashtra’ kii sthapana karne kaa aadhaar he
 a nation based on nationalism remains in the imagination until it is transformed into a nation-state
 haalaanki duniya main aisa koi raashtra nahin he jo in kasautiyon par puri tarah se feet baithta ho, iske baavjood agar vishwa kii atlas uthaa kar dekhi jaae to dharti kii ek-ek inch zamin rashtron kii simaaon ke bich banti hui milegi
 Nationalism emerged in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but even after its known history of only two-and-a-half hundred years old, the idea has proved to be extremely powerful and durable
 rashtriya simaaon ke bheetar rahane vaale logon ko apane-apane raashtra kaa astitv swaabhaavik, pracheen, chirantan or sthir lagata he
 The strength of this idea can also be gauged from the fact that national communities formed on the basis of it also cross class, caste and religious divisions
 rashtrawaad ke aadhaar par bane kaarykram or raajnneetik pariyojna ke hisaab se jab kisi raashtra-rajya kii sthapana ho jaati he to uski simaaon main rahane waalon se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve apni vibhinn asmitaaon ke upar raashtra ke prati nishtha ko hi ahmiyat denge
 They will obey the law of the nation and will sacrifice their lives for its internal and external security
 yahan yah spasht kar dena zaruri he ki aapas main kai samantaayein hone ke baavjood rashtrawaad or deshbhakti main antar he
 Nationalism is essentially the carrier of some program and project, whereas the spirit of patriotism is not obeyed by any such condition
 rashtrawaad ke aalochakon kii kami nahin he or na hi use kaarij karne waalon ke tark kam prabhaavshaalee hai
 Nationalism in the form of an epilogue suppresses small identities and pushes them into the background
 angrezon ke kilaaf chale rashtravaadi andolan ke dauraan rabindranath thakur jaisi hastiyaan is vichaar ko andeh kii nigaah se dekhati thim
 But the topic of interest is that most critics of nationalism are not forced to live within the borders of the nation, but many of them appear to be contributing towards the establishment of some nation
 rashtrawaad vibhinn vichaardhaaraon ko bhi apane agosh main samet letaa he
 Looking at the example of India, it is clear how the advocates of modernist Jawaharlal Nehru, Marxist Krishna Menon, anti-industrialist Mahatma Gandhi and so on have formed Indian nationalism
 rashtrawaad ke prashn ke saath kai saidhantik ulajhanein judi hui hai
 For example, what is the relationship between nationalism and modern culture and capitalism? What is the difference between Western and Eastern Nationalism? Is nationalism progressive or regressive as a political phenomenon? Although religion is not recognized as the basic basis of a nation, nations are also formed on the basis of religion as well as language
 sawaal yah he ki ye kaarak rashtron ko ekajute rakhane main naakaam kyon ho jate hai? saanskrithik or raajnneetik rashtrawaad ko alag-alag kaise samajha ja saktaa he? in sawaalon kaa jawaab dena aasaan nahin he, kyonki raajnneeti vigyaan main ek siddhant ke taur par rashtrawaad kaa suvyavasthit or gahan adhyayan maujuud nahin he
 The circumstantial character of various nationalisms also adds to these complexities
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki upar varnit samaj ke alaava rashtrawaad kii koi ek aisi saarvbhaum thiyari uplabdh nahin he jise sabhi pakshon dwaara manyata di jaati ho
 Marxism has also failed to provide the principles related to nationalism
 duniya bhar ke mazaduron ko ek hone kaa naaraa dene vaale marks or angels maanate the ki mazaduron kaa koi desh nahin hota
 In his writings, he did not give preference to any phenomenon that goes beyond class division to political-social and cultural unity
 apane yug ke kuch rashtriya sangharshon ke bare main to unki tiraskaarpurn dharna yah thi ki ve nasht ho jane ke liye abhishpt hai
 Instead of giving a complete theory of nationalism, his compositions consider the national question under the practical politics of his era
 duusare or tisare international main rashtrawaad par kaafii bahes hui
 Lenin placed the need for political democracy at the center of his nationalist analysis while grappling with the problems of revolutionizing a vast multi-ethnic empire
 unka nishkarsh tha ki rashtron ko aatm-nirnay kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 After this Stalin's famous work Marxism and National Question came out in which he tried to give a theory of nationalism
 stallin ne raashtra ke paanch mukhya tatva bataaye : ek sthir or nairantary se yukt samudaay, ek alag bhu-kshetra, samaan bhashaa, aarthik susangati or samuhik charitra
 Since Stalin was looking at the emergence of nations as related to the needs of industrialization, his theory ignored the historical background of nationalism and many questions arising from it
 kul mila kar marxvaadi maanate rahe ki rashtrawaad poonjeewaad ke vikaas main uskaa sahyogi ban kar ubhara he
 Therefore, it should be classified as a Burzwa ideology
 rashtrawaad prabhutvshaalee virgon ko ekajute karke raajnneetik samudaay kii ek bhrant anubhuti paidaa karata he taaki poonjipatiyon dwaara kiye jane vaale ahernish shoshan or daridrikaran ke baavjood aam log dhani varg ke saath ekta kaa ehsaas karte rahen
 One paradox of Marxist discourse is that even after considering nationalism as the ideology of the capitalist class, many communist parties have made nationalism the basis of their mobilization on the ground of revolutionary politics
 kranti ke pashchaat samaajawaadee samaaj kii rachana ke liye bhi rashtravaadi bhaawanaaon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Horace B
 in the seventies Davis, while summarizing Marxist arguments, termed one form of nationalism as enlightening by linking it with enlightenment and the other form by connecting it with culture and tradition, and sentimentalism
 lekin, davis ne bhi rashtrawaad ko ek auzaar se zyaada ahmiyat nahin di or kaha ki hathode se hatya bhi kii ja sakati he or nirmaan bhi
 Through nationalism, when oppressed communities fight for their freedom, it becomes a positive moral force and when an attack is taken in the name of the nation, it cannot be morally defended
 rashtrawaad kii sabhi marxvaadi vyakhyaaon main sarvaadhik chamakdaar thiyari benedict anderson dwaara pratipaadit ‘kalpit samudaay’ kii maani jaati he
 Andersen's main concern is how people who never meet each other and are completely unfamiliar with each other, are bound in national unity
 darasal, rashtrawaad se sambandhit sabhi vyakhyaayein thodi dur chalane ke baad pechida ho jaati hai
 One of the main explanations of these is that the process of modernization brings itself to the ground through nationalism
 is tarah rashtrawaad ‘aadhunikeekaran ke dharm’ ke taur par ubharta he
 In the midst of the tremendous economic and political upheaval in the social life due to modernity, it was only through nationalism that a person could achieve an identity and a source of cohesion
 duusari taraf yah bhi ek hakeekat he ki rashtrawaad kai baar aadhunikeekaran ko rokane yaa simit karne vaali takat bhi sabit hua he
 On the basis of nationalist arguments, many such trade agreements are opposed which can accelerate the process of national industrialization and economic prosperity
 rashtrawaad ke dharmik sanskaran secularikaran kii prakriya ko agar puri tarah thap nahin kar pate to dhimaa avashya kar dete hai
 Secondly, in most third world countries, nationalism is stuck in the struggle of industrialization and agricultural economy even after almost half a century has passed
 pashchimi or purvi rashtrawadon kii tulana karne ke dauraan kuch vidwaanon ne purvi rashtrawaad ko pashchimi rashtrawaad ke swasth mulyon kii kami kaa shikaar bataaya he
 Some scholars classify Western nationalism as political and Eastern nationalism as cultural
 in dharanaon ke vipareet kuch anya vidwaan ulti manyata pesh karte karte hai : european rashtrawaad ek deshaj aitihaasik prakriya se nikalne ke kaaran kahin adhik saanskrithik he, jabaki purvi rashtrawaad upniveshwaad virdohi raajnneetik andolanon ke haathon gadhe jane ke kaaran multah raajnneetik he
 Secondly, if the nationalism of third world countries dominate the ethnic, ethnic and cultural aspects, then there is the role of colonialism behind them, whose responsibility should be placed on the West
 upniveshvaadiyon ne manamaane dhang se sthaneey jaatiyataaon kii upeksha kii jiske kaaran africa main kai kabeelai or jataayi samudaay do paraspar sangharshrat rashtron main vibhajit ho gayi hai
 Thirdly, there are many societies including India which are traditionally endowed with cultural, religious and linguistic diversity
 aise samaajon main rashtrawaad kaa anubhav pashchimi anubhav se bhinn hona laazmi he
 Under such circumstances, at times nationalism acts as a formula for mutual cohesion among the pluralities and sometimes gets caught in violent conflict and competition between sub-nationalities
 pashchimi rashtrawaad ke prashansak purvi rashtrawaad ke kai kuch pahaluon ko tarkbuddhi se pare bataa kar uske mahatva ko kaarij karte hai
 But some scholars have pointed out that such elements are also decisively present in Western nationalism
 masalan, agar bhartiya rashtravaadi kisi jamaane main kaali devi kii aradhana karke prerana praapt karte the, to europe ke romani rashtravaadi bhi isi prakaar ke samuhiktavaadi, hinsak or aadhyatmik ayaamon se prerit hote rahe hai
 Proving the nationalism of the West as liberal, sensible and universal can lead to the achievement of an explanatory ideal, but in practice it is not so
 pashchimi rashtrawaad ho yaa purvi rashtrawaad, donon hi paristhitiyon main saanskrithik or raajnneetik rashtrawaad ek-duusare se pratiyogita karte hue ek-duusare ko pusht karte chalate hai
 The process of globalization has challenged nationalism tremendously
 beesvin sadi ke aakiri do dashakon or ikkisvin sadi ke pehle dashak ke baad kaha ja saktaa he ki kam se kam duniya kaa prabhu varg ek si bhashaa bolta he, ek si yatraayen karata he, ek sa kaanaa khaataa he
 National boundaries are no longer important to him
 iske alaava aarthik bhoomandaleekaran, bade paimaane par hone vaali logon kii awajahi, internet or mobile phone jaisi praudyogikeey pragati ne duniya main faasalon ko bahut kam kar diya he
 There is a growing number of people who want to move away from their country and cultural environment in search of work and life
 europe kii dharti ne rashtrawaad ko janm diya tha or vahiin ab europee sangh kaa udai rashtrawaad kaa mahatva kam kar rahaa he
 In this new situation, some scholars have started saying that the forces that once strengthened nationalism are going to cause its downfall
 rashtriya sanrachanaon ke bajaay rashtron se pare jane vaale aarthik or raajnneetik gathjod aane vaali sadiyon par haaavee rahenge
 There is truth in these claims, but only partially
 ek raajnneetik takat ke rup main rashtrawaad aaj bhi nirnaayak bana hua he
 The cultural revivalist movement going on in the East, the worldwide race and immigration debate and the West's BPO controversy is a proof of this
 aaj bhi philistiniyon dwaara rashtriya aatm-nirnay kaa andolan jari he
 East Timur has recently become independent from Indonesia and formed a separate nation
 bhoomandaleekaran kii prakriya ne rashtrawaad ke bolbaale ko kuch sandigdh avashya kar diya he, par is tathy se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki udaarataavaadi or loktantric rajya se gathjod karke garibi or pichhadepan ke shikaar samaajon ko aage le jane main rashtrawaad kii aitihaasik bhoomika ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 All post-colonial societies have resorted to nationalism to pursue their developmental goals
 khaas taur se bharat jaise bahultamulak samaajon ko ek raajnneetik samudaay main viksit karne main rashtrawaad ek pramukh kaarak rahaa he

 The British rulers of India always followed the policy of "divide and rule" in India
 unhone bharat ke nagarikon ko sampradaay ke anusaar alag-alag samoohon main baant kar rakhaa
 Some of his policies discriminated against Hindus and some against Muslims
 20veen sadi aate-aate musalmaan hinduon ke bahumat se darane lage or hinduon ko lagane laga ki british sarkaar or bhartiya netaa musalamaanon ko visheshadhikaar dene or hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karne main lage hai
 Therefore, when the spirit of independence began to emerge in India, the leaders of both sects were competing in controlling the freedom struggle
 san 1906 main dhaka main bahut se musalmaan netaaon ne milakar muslim lig kii sthapana kii
 These leaders were of the view that Muslims had less rights than majority Hindus and that the Indian National Congress represented Hindus
 muslim lig ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag maangen rakhin

 1935 main sindh praant kii vidhaan sabha ne bhi yahi maang uthaai
 Iqbal and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar asked Muhammad Ali Jinnah to support this demand
 is samay tak jinna hindu-muslim ekta ke paksh main lagate the, lekin dhire-dhire unhone aarope lagaana shuru kar diya ki congressi netaa musalamaanon ke hiton par dhyaan nahin de rahe
 At the 1940 Muslim League Conference in Lahore, Jinnah clearly stated that he wanted two different nations
 hindu mahasabha jaise hindu sanghathan bharat ke bantwaare ke prabal virdohi the, lekin maanate the ki hinduon or musalamaanon main matbhed hai
 In a speech at the conference of Hindu Mahasabha in Allahabad in 1937, Veer Savarkar said - India is not a nation today, there are two nations here - Hindu and Muslim
 congress ke adhiktar netaa panth-nirpeksh the or sampradaay ke aadhaar par bharat kaa vibhaajan karne ke viruddh the
 Mahatma Gandhi believed that Hindus and Muslims could live together and they should live together
 unhone vibhaajan kaa ghor virodh kiya: "meri puri aatma is vichaar ke viruddh vidroh karti he ki hindu or musalmaan do virdohi mat or samskritiyaan hai
 To approve such a doctrine is like rejecting God for me
 " bahut saalon tak gandhi or unke anuyaayiyon ne koshish kii ki musalmaan congress ko chhod kar na jaaen or is prakriya main hindu or musalmaan garam dalon ke netaa unase bahut chidh gaye
 The British plannedly promoted suspicion of both Hindu and Muslim sects
 muslim lig ne agast 1946 main sidhi kaarywahi diwas manaaya or kalakatta main bheeshan dange kiye jisamen kareeb 5000 log maare gayi or bahut se ghayal hue
 In such an environment, all the leaders were under pressure to accept the partition so that the country does not come completely into a state of war

 These 565 states were given the freedom to choose who they would like to join India or Pakistan
 adhiktar rajyon ne bahumat dharm ke aadhaar par desh chunaa
 There was a lot of controversy in the integration of the states whose rulers chose the country which suited the majority religion
 vibhaajan ke baad pakistan ko sanyukt raashtra main nae sadsy ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya or bharat ne british bharat kii kursi sanbhali
 The wealth of British India was shared between the two countries but this process began to drag on for too long
 gandhiji ne bharat sarkaar par dabaav daalaa ki vah pakistan ko dhan jaldi bheje jabaki is samay tak bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh shuru ho chukaa tha or dabaav badhaane ke liye anshan shuru kar diya
 The Indian government had to succumb to this pressure and send money to Pakistan
 22 oktober 1947 ko pakistan ne kashmir par akraman kar diya, usase purv mountbaton ne bharat sarkaar se pakistan sarkaar ko 55 karod rupee kii raashi dene kaa paraamarsh diya tha
 The Union Cabinet decided to postpone giving this amount in view of the attack but at the same time Gandhi started a fast-unto-death to get this amount immediately, as a result of which this amount was given to Pakistan against the interests of India
 nathuram godse ne mahatma gandhi ke is kaam ko unki hatya karne kaa ek kaaran bataaya
 Many scholars believe that the British government did not handle the process of partition properly
 chunki swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa pehle or vibhaajan kii ghoshnaa baad main kii gayi, desh main shanti kaayam rakhane kii jimmevary bharat or pakistan kii nayi sarkaron ke sar par ai
 Nobody thought that many people would go from here

 yadi praapt amla ko or adhik nirjalit karnaa ho, to usamen kuch phosphorus pentoxide daalkar hilaate hai or drav kaa pun: aswan kar lete hai
 The commercial method of making prussic acid is: Sulfuric acid is reacted on an aqueous solution of 23% sodium cyanide inside a generator with lead levels and condensates the vapors obtained by this action
 is kriya ke antargat amla kii maatra ko cynide kii maatra se adhik rakhaa jaataa he
 Partial distillation of the liquid thus obtained gives prusic acid of about 98% concentration
 isi prakaar sodium cynide ke sthaan par calcium cynide lekar bhi ise praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In Germany, a significant amount of this acid is also made from molasses obtained from the sugar beet industry
 in vidhiyon ke atirikt sanshleshan dwaara bhi prusik amla praapt kiya jaataa he
 There are two major methods for this

 Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates such as the Antarctic
 In fact, some species of penguins now live only a few south

 Among the present-day penguins, larger penguins live in colder regions, while smaller penguins are also commonly found in temperate or tropical climates
 Some prehistoric species were as tall and weighed in size as an adult human
 This species was not limited to the Antarctic regions; Rather, the Antarctic subcontinent was more diverse in the regions, and at least one giant penguin has been found in an area not far from 35 to 2000 km south of the equator and where the climate is warmer than it is today
 "penguin" shabd kii vyutpatti atyaadhik vivaadit he
 The English word is apparently not of French nor of Breton or of Spanish origin, but the first appears to be of English or Dutch language

 An alternative etymology is found in English dictionaries, which link the word to the Latin language pinguis "fat", because of its perceived shape
 yah vyutpatti asambhav hogi yadi "penguin" ko "multah" great ouk ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa tha, jaisaa ki kuch sutron kaa kahana he
 a third theory suggests that the term is a changed form of "pen-wing", with reference to the rudimentary wings of both the penguin and the Great Oak

 In the absence of direct evidence, it may be said that by the end of the Cretaceous, penguin lineages had developed differently, although not as contiguous as they are today; It is quite likely that they were not completely flightless at that time, as birds unable to fly are generally very small, leading to their initial phase of mass extinction due to low capacity

 It is not yet known whether giant Palaeudyptinae represents monophyletic generation, or whether giantia emerged separately in Palaeudyptinae and Anthroporinithinae - whether they were validated, or whether Palaeudyptinae contained a large range that was demarcated as generally Including nowadays
 Ancient and well-described giant penguins, the 5-foot-high Icadyptes salasi as far north as in northern Peru, were found 36 mya ago

 The reason for their decline and extinction was the spread of the species that feed them, Skulodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which of course struggled to eat them and eventually succeeded
 a new lineage, the Paraptenoidites, which includes short but decidedly stout legs, had already been born in South America by that time

 "as an early species, the Pygoscelis seem to have perished during the Bertonian era, but the main cause of the diversity today is range expansion and radiation, the early Miocene up to that time, about 20–15 mya ago, from the Bardigalian phase
" It may not have been before

 The emergence of the Antarctic subcontinent lineage at the end of the Bertonian coincided with the slow onset of the cooling period which eventually lasted some 3
5 million ice ages
 The main reason for the decline of habitat by the Priabonians on the Antarctic is due to the more favorable conditions in the Antarctic subfields than in the Antarctic
 Notably, the cold Antarctic Pole-like continuous current began only around 30 mya, cooling the Antarctic on the one hand and spreading Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond

 Later, a mild summer period was ended by climate change of the Middle Miocene, a sharp drop in global average temperature by 14–12 mya, and some similar cold events occurred between 8 mya and 4 mya; By the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was somewhat similar in extension and extent to what it is today
