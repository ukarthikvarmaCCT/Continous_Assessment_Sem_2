 ise kabhi-kabhaar santulit sansad yaa bina kisi niyantran vaali vidhayika bhi kaha jaataa he
 If the legislature is bicameral and the government is only responsible to the lower house, then the term "hung parliament" is used only for that house
 do party pranali ke adhikansh chunaavon main ek party ko purna bahumat praapt ho jaataa he or vah jald hi ek nai sarkaar kaa gathan kar leti he; "trishanku sansad" is dhaanche kaa ek apwaad he or ise aniyamit yaa avaanchhneeya mana ja saktaa he
 One or both main parties may try to form a coalition government with some other smaller parties, or a minority government with the help of some other parties or independent members
 yadi ye prayaas vifal ho jate he, sansad bhang karne or nae sire se chunaav karaae jane ke atirikt koi vikalp nahin bachataa he
 In a multi-party system, as is usually the case in legislatures elected by proportional representation, negotiation for the formation of post-election coalition government is quite common; The term "hung parliament" is not used
 united kingdom, australia or canada, in sabhi kii vartmaan sansad trishanku sansad hai
 It is quite unusual for Commonwealth nations to have such a large number of hung parliaments at the national level
 pratham vishwa yuddh se pehle united kingdom main kai pidiyon tak, ek kaaphi had tak sthir do-daleey pranali astitv main thi; paaramparik taur par keval tori or vigs, yaa unnisvin sadi ke madhya se conservative tathaa libral partiyaan sansad main kaaphi adhik sankhya main apane sadasyon ko nirvaachit karne main safal raheen
 Thus hung parliaments were quite rare in the nineteenth century

 However, the two Reform Acts greatly broadened the franchise and reorganized the constituencies, coincidentally at the same time, considerable changes were seen in Irish politicians
 1885 ke aam chunaavon ke baad kisi bhi party ko purna bahumat nahin mila
 The Irish Parliamentary Party held the key to power and offered Irish self-government as a condition for its support
 haalanki, libral party irish swarajya ke mudde par vibhajit ho gai, jiske parinamswaroop 1886 main phir se aam chunaav hue jisamen kanjarvative ne adhikansh siton par kabja karte hue swarajya kaa virodh karne vaali libral unianist party ke samarthan se shashan kiya
 The elections of January 1910 and December 1910 gave rise to a hung parliament in which the ruling Liberal Party and the Conservative Party won almost identical seats
 aisa sansadeey sankat tathaa lebar party ke udai ke kaaran hua tha
 This did not happen for many years after the hung parliament that emerged as a result of the 1929 elections; Meanwhile, the Labor Party moved out of the Liberal Party and became one of the two major parties
 1929 ke chunaavon ke baad se, britain main do aam chunaavon main trishanku sansad saamne ai he
 The first was the election of February 1974 and the parliament formed lasted only till October
 The second election was in May 2010, resulting in a hung parliament and the Conservative Party as the largest party
 teen mukhya partiyon ke parinaam is prakaar the - conservatives - 307, lebar- 258, libral democrates - 57
 The loss of a by-election may lead to the end of a weakened majority of the government, and the creation of a hung parliament by members of Parliament joining the opposition, or the resignation of mps of the House of Common
 aisa disambar 1996 main jon major kii conservative sarkaar or 1978 ke madhya main james calhan kii lebar sarkaar ke saath hua tha; is baad kii avadhi ko asantosh kaa sheetkaal ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Jim Callahan's minority government came when Labor ended its 15-month agreement after the Liberals lost a majority in early 1977
 shodhakarta andrew blik or stuart wilks-hig ke anusaar "trishanku sansad" shabd kaa euke main aam upyog 1970 ke dashak ke madhya ke baad hi shuru hua tha or press main iskaa pehali baar upyog patrkaar simon hogart dwaara 1974 main da gargian main kiya gaya
 Studies related to the hung parliament include David Butler's Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliament in Britain and Vernon Bogdanore's 'multi-party Politics and the Constitution'
 canada kii vartmaan sansad, 38veen tathaa 39veen sansad kii hi tarah trishanku sansad he; haalanki, canada main is shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead, the term "minority government" or "minority parliament" is used
 haalanki alpsankhyak sarkarein aksar alpakaalik hoti hai, pradhanmantri stephen harper ke netritv vaali vartmaan alpsankhyak sarkaar farvari 2006 ke baad se satta main bane rahane main safal rahi he
 Harper's Conservative Party improved its minority status in the October 2008 federal election; It is also a hung parliament
 harper or kanjarvative ke lokapriy maton ke pratishat main ek choti vruddhi dekhne ko mili he, lekin vaastavik lokapriy maton main ek choti kami or canada ke house of comons main 308 siton main se 143 siton ke saath pratinidhitiv main vruddhi bhi dekhne ko mili
 Hung parliaments at the federal level are rare in Australia, as the system here is almost identical to a two party system in which the Australian Labor Party competes against a coalition of Conservative parties
 1910 se pehle kisi bhi party ko pratinidhi sabha main purna bahumat praapt nahin tha kyonki vahaan do gaiyr-lebar partiyaan pratispardhaa main thim
 As a result, there was a constant change in government, many of which took place during the tenure of Parliament
 1910 main jab do daleey vyavastha ko majbootee mili, uske baad se vahaan keval do baar trishanku sansad dekhne ko mili hai, 1940 or 2010 main
 1940 ke sangheey chunaav main nivartmaan pradhanmantri robert menzis ne do swatantra nirdaleey sadasyon kaa samarthan praapt kiya or satta main bane rahe, lekin sansadeey kaarykaal ke dauraan nirdaleey sadasyon ne apana samarthan lebar ko de diya or jon curtin satta main aa gaye
 In the 2010 federal election, outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard received the support of four independent members and remained in power
 trishanku sansad rajya str par kahin adhik saamaanya hai
 The Tasmania Legislative Assembly and a unicameral parliament of the Australian Capital Territory are both elected by the heyer-clark proportional representation, so a hung parliament usually appears in elections
 anya rajyon or kshetron main mukhyatah do daleey pranali he, lekin kai baar trishanku sansad saamne aati he jisamen satta kii kunjee swatantra saansadon or chote dalon ke pratinidhiyon ke paas hoti he
 Recent examples include New South Wales in 1991, Queensland in 1995, Victoria in 1999, South Australia in 2002 and Western Australia in 2008
 nirnaayak chunaav parinaamon ke aadi deshon main trishanku sansad ko aksar nakaaratmak parinaam ke taur par dekha jaataa he jisase apekshaakrit kamjor or asthir sarkaar kaa janm hota he
 a period of uncertainty after the election is common, as major party leaders try to establish a majority by negotiating with independents and smaller parties

 Alternatively, a minority government with trust and supply agreements can be formed based on previously agreed policy concessions or issue-based support
 farvari 1974 ke aam chunaav main vartmaan pradhanmantri edward hith ne vipakshi lebar party kii tulana main kam site jeetne ke baavjood ek gathbandhan sarkaar banane kaa prayaas karne ke liye istipha dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 They were unable to do so, so the Labor Party led by Harold Wilson formed a minority government
 britain ke 2010 ke aam chunaavon main ek or trishanku sansad astitv main ai or ek sthir sarkaar banane kaa prayaas karne ke liye vyapak vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya

64 Orchha near Jhansi has its own significance in the history of India
 isse judi tamaam kahaniyaan or kisse pichhali kai dashakon se logon kii jubaan par hai
 Some people say that the first people started living in Bundelkhand
 yahi vajah he ki is ilaake ke har gaanv or shahar ke paas sunaane ko kai kahaniyaan hai
 Two beautiful and interesting places of Bundelkhand are Orchha and Kundar
 bhale hi donon jagahon main kuch kilometre kaa faasla ho, lekin itihaas ke dhaagon se ye donon jagahen behad majbootee se judi hui hai
 Orchha is located about half an hour from Jhansi
 iskaa itihaas 8veen shatabdi se shuru hota he, jab gurjar pratihaar samraat mihir bhoj ne isaki sthapana kii thi
 The first and most interesting story of this place is that of a temple
 darasal, yah mandir bhagwaan ram kii murti ke liye banwaaya gaya tha, lekin murti sthapana ke vakt yah apane sthaan se hili nahin
 This idol was brought from Ayodhya by his queen Ganesh Kuwar during the reign of Madhukar Shah
 chaturbhuj mandir banane se pehle ise kuch samay ke liye mahal main sthapit kiya gaya
 But after the temple was built, no one could move the idol from its place
 ise ishwar kaa chamatkaar maanate hue mahal ko hi mandir kaa rup de diya gaya or iskaa naam rakhaa gaya ram raja mandir
 Today the city is situated around this palace and thousands of devotees gather here on Ram Navami
 vaise, bhagwaan ram ko yahaan bhagwaan maanane ke saath yahaan kaa raja bhi mana jaataa he, kyonki us murti kaa cheharaa mandir kii ore na hokar mahal kii ore he
 There is a garden near the temple in which two very high towers are the center of attraction of the people
 jinhen sawan bhadon kaha jaataa he ki inke neeche bani surangon ko shahi parivaar apane aane-jane ke raste ke taur par istemaal karata tha
 There is a legend about these pillars that according to Hindu calendar in the rainy season, these two pillars were joined at the end of the month of Sawan and the beginning of the month of Bhadon
 haalanki iske bare main pukhta saboot nahin hai
 The paths to the bottom of these minarets have been closed and there is no way of research

 There are four palaces, Jahangir Mahal, Raj Mahal, Sheesh Mahal and Rai Parveen Mahal built some distance away from them

 It is said that Emperor Akbar sent Abul Fazl to control Shahzade Salim, but Salim killed him with the help of Bir Singh
 isse khush hokar saleem ne orchha kii kaman bir singh ko saunp di thi
 By the way, these palaces are evidences of the architecture of the Bundelas
 khule galiyare, pattharon vaali jaali kaa kaam, jaanwaron kii murtiyon, belboote jaisi tamaam bundela vaastushilp kii visheshtaayen yahaan saaf dekhi ja sakati hai
 Now these very cool looking palaces were not like this in their era
 yahaan rojaanaa hone vaali nai halchal se upji kahaniyaan aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par hai
 One of these is the story of Hardaul, which dates back to the reign of Jujhar Singh
 darasal, mughal jasuson kii sajeeshabhari kathaon ke karan is raja kaa shaq ho gaya tha ki uski rani se uske bhai hardaul ke saath sambandh hai
 So he asked the queen to poison Hardaul
 rani ke aisa na kar paane par khud ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye hardaul ne khud hi jehar pi liya or tyaag kii nai misaal kaayam kii
 With the end of the Bundelaas reign in 1783, Orchha too was lost in the thick forests of oblivion and then it came into the limelight during the freedom struggle
 darasal, swatantraaa senaanee chandrashekhar aaazaad yahaan ke ek gaanv main aakar chhipe the
 Today a memento is also made at his place of stay

 There is a fascinating story of Ramraja coming from Orodha to Orchha
 ek din orchha naresh madhukarshah ne apni patni ganeshkunwari se krishna upasna ke iraade se vrundavan chalane ko kaha
 But Rani Ram was a devotee
 unhone vrundavan jane se manaa kar diya
 In anger, the king told him that if you are such a Ram devotee, then go and bring your Ram to Orchha
 rani ne ayodhya pahunchakar sarayu nadi ke kinare lakshmana kile ke paas apni kuti banaakar sadhana aarambh kii
 These days, Saint Shiromani Tulsidas was also practicing meditation in Ayodhya

 But the queen did not see Ramaraja for several months
 antat: vah niraash hokar apane praan tyaagane sarayu kii majdhaar main kud paddy
 Here he saw Ramaraja in the deep depths of water
 rani ne unhen apana mantavya bataaya
 Ramraja agreed to walk to Orchha but he kept three conditions - first, this journey will be on foot, second - the journey will be only in the flower constellation, third - the statue of Ramaraja will not rise again from the place where it will be kept
 rani ne raja ko sandesh bheja ki wo ramraaja ko lekar orchha aa raheen hai
 King Madhukarshah built the Chaturbhuj Temple at a cost of crores to establish the Deity of Ramaraja
 jab rani orchha pahunchi to unhone yah murti apane mahal main rakh di
 It was decided that the statue would be consecrated by placing the idol in the auspicious idol in the Chaturbhuj temple
 lekin ram ke is vigrah ne chaturbhuj jane se manaa kar diya
 It is said that Ram came here as a child and leaving his mother's palace, how could he go to the temple
 ram aaj bhi isi mahal main virajman hai or unke liye bana karodon kaa chaturbhuj mandir aaj bhi viraan pada he
 This temple is still idolless
 yah bhi ek sanyog he ki jis samvath 1631 ko ramraaja kaa orchha main aagaman hua, usee din ramcharita maanas kaa lekhan bhi purna hua
 The idol present in Orchha is told that when Ram was going to exile, he gave one of his child idols to mother Kaushalya
 maa kaushalya usee ko bal bhoga lagaaya karti thim
 When Ram returned to Ayodhya, Kaushalya immersed this idol in the Saryu River
 yahi murti ganeshkunwari ko sarayu kii majdhaar main mili thi
 It is the only temple in the world where Rama is worshiped as a king and he is given a salute before sunrise and after sunset

 veshyaaon ko kaamshaastra kii shiksha denevaali nari ko kuttani kehete hai
 Its existence as an essential part of the prostitute institution is seen for the first time around the fifth century AD
 isse anumaan hota he ki iskaa aavirbhaav gupt samrajya ke vaibhavshaalee or bhogavilas ke yug main hua
 In order to show the widespread influence of Kuttani, great utility for prostitutes and the accomplishment of subjugation of sexiest people, Damodar Gupta, the Prime Minister of Kashmir King Jayaped, wrote a poem called Kuttanimatam
 yah kavy apni madhurima, shabdasoshthav tathaa arthgambhiry ke nimitt aalochanajgat main paryaapt vikhyath he, parantu kavi kaa vastavaki abhipraay sajjanon ko kuttani ke hatkandon se bachaana he
 For this purpose, the famous poet Kshemendra of Kashmir also practiced poems named Samyamatruka and Deshopadesh in the eleventh century
 in donon kaavyon main kuttani ke rup, gun tathaa kaary kaa vistrut vivaran he
 Some description of Kuttani is also available in Hindi texts
 kuttani avasthaa main vruddh hoti he jise kaami sansar kaa bahut anubhav hota he
 Kuttani, depicted in Kuttinamat, can be easily guessed from the Kutni as the outer shape of the Kutni - the inner eyes, the inferior to the Bhushan and the lower part of the ear hanging below, the head made of black and white with Ganges, the veins on the body
 , Stretched neck, white washed dhoti and sheet-embellished body, Embellished thread embellished with many herbs and beads, fine gold trick in junior finger La
 veshyaaon ko unke vyavsaay kii shiksha dena tathaa unhen un hatkandon kaa gyaan karana jinke bal par ve kaami janon se prabhoot dhan kaa apharan kar saken, iskaa pradhan kaary he
 Kshmendra has compared it to many Hissar animals due to this special quality - it is a blood-drinking and meat-eating disease, which the sensual people make like a jackal, bouncing: kuttani ke bina veshya apane vyavsaay kaa purna nirvaah nahin kar sakati
 An inexperienced prostitute's guru sthaniya kuttani is a statue of deceit and deceit for the masses, there are odd instruments to make money; It is the river of Maya, famous for felling trees like trees, whose floods submerge thousands of rich houses: kuttani veshya ko kaamukon se dhan anthne kii shiksha detii hai, hriday dene kii nahin; vah use premsanpann dhanaheenon ko ghar se nikaal baahar karne kaa bhi upadesh detii he

 Kavyanushasana distinguished him in the category of poets of high order
 purvaacharyo se bahut kach lekar parvarti vichaarkon ko chintan ke liye vipul saamagree pradaan kii
 There are three main parts of Kavyanushasana - sutra, interpretation and sodhasana vritti
 sutro kii vyakhya karne vaali vyakhya 'alankarchudamani' naam prachlit he
 And to clarify, a version called 'vivek' was written
 'kavyanushasan' 8 adhyyon main vibhajit 208 sutro main kavyashastra ke saare vishyon kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 807 examples are presented in 'alankarchudamani' and 825 examples are presented in 'vivek'

 Kavyanushasana is often a collection book
 rajasekharake 'kavyamimasaa', mammatke 'kavyprakash', aanandavardhan ke 'dhvanyalok', abhinav guptake 'lochan' se paryaapt matraamein saamagree grahan kii he
 Hemachandra is his independent opinion about originality
 hemchandra matse koi bhi granthkaar nayi cheez nahin likhata
 Although Mammatka is very much similar to Hemavandraka 'kavyanushasana' with 'kaviprakash'
 paryaapt sthanon par hemachandracharyane mammatka virodh kiya he
 According to Hemachandracharya, Anand, Yash and Kantulya preaching can only be poetic purposes and according to Hemachandra, according to Hemachandra, meaning, gain, knowledge and negative retirement are not poetic purposes
 'kavyanushasan se kavyashasre ke pathakon kon samajane main sulabhta, sugamawa hoti he
 Mammatka 'kaviprakash' is elaborate, well organized, not accessible
 aganit tikaaen hone par bhi mammatka 'kavyprakash' durgam rah jaataa he
 In 'kavyanushasan' this inaccessibility has been facilitated by 'alankarchudamani' and 'vivek'
 'kavyanushasan' main spasht likhte hai ki ve apana mat nirdhaaran abhinavgupt evam bharat ke aadhaar par kar rahe hai
 In fact, Hemachandra, presenting the quotation of other texts, is fundamental from his own independent opinion, style, approach
 granth evam granthkaaron ke naam se sanskrit-sahitya, itihaas par prakaash padataa he
 The best textbook for all levels of readers

 There is no specific difference between Jainism and Hinduism in general
 jain dharm vaidic karm - kand ke prathibandh evam us ke hinsa sambandhi vidhanokon sweekaar nahin karata
 Acharya Hemchandra's philosophy work 'pramanamamsa' holds a special place

 The Sutra style text is similar to Kanad or Akshpad

 His debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ Released in January 1973, which established him as a critical favorite, although album sales were slow
 Due to Springsteen's lyrical poeticism and folk rock-based musical parable in songs like "blinded by the Light" and "for You", as well as Columbia and Hammond contacts, critics initially compared Bob Delan to Springsteen 
 Peter Knubler, editor of Cravaddy magazine, wrote in Springsteen's first interview / outline on the news stand in February 1973, in March 1973 "they sing with such freshness and insistence that i have never heard of 'like a Rolling Stone'
" sangeet sameekshak lester bangs ne 1975 main kriim main likhaa ki jab springsteen kaa pehla elbum jari hua tha "

 "4th of July, Asbury Park" and "incident on 57th Street" became fan favorites and the long, encouraging "rosalita" remained one of Springsteen's most loved musical units
 22 may 1974 ko, boston ke di real paper main sangeet sameekshak jone landu ne harvard squaire theatre main ek pradirshan dekhne ke baad likhaa, "maine rock and role kaa bhavishya dekha or iskaa naam he bruce springsteen

 But with the encouragement of the release of an early mix of "born to Run" in Progressive Rock Radio, the album's release was likely
 Overall, the album took more than 14 months to record, with the song "born to Run" alone taking six months
 "during this time, Springsteen struggled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he had" a brainwash Voices ", which they cannot explain to others in the studio
 During these recording sessions," Miami "steve Van Zandit arrived by chance at the studio at just the right time And helped Springsteen streamline the horn section on "tenth Avenue freeze-out" and eventually joined the e Street Band

 This established him as a serious and dynamic rock and roll personality who speaks for a large part of the rock audience in his voice

 Springsteen had to stay out of the studio for nearly a year due to a legal battle with former manager Mike Apple, during which he toured the US and retained the e Street Band
 Despite the optimistic enthusiasm he often performed, he wrote new songs and often staged them for the first time, making his voice more serious and sad than ever
 1977 main appal ke saath samjhauta ho jane par springsteen antat studio laut aae or darkeness on di age of toun ke nirmaan ke baaqi satron ko puraa kiya

 DCP Silva of the Bombay Police asks Vijay to take the form of a don, so that he can act as the informer of the police, as well as help the police to crack the criminal network of the don
 'don' mumbai main ek anderworld apradhi he, jisaki talash mumbai police or interpol, donon ko he
 Dawn, who is included in Interpol's 'most Wanted' list of criminals, manages to escape by dodging the police every time
 apane nirdayee swabhaav ke kaaran, police ke atirikt don ke anya dushman bhi hai
 Mainly, Don once killed a colleague, Ramesh, after which his fiancée 'kamini' and sister 'roma' became enemies of Don

 Vijay gives the diary to d'silva, and after reading it, he learns that Don's boss is named Vardhan, but no more information about him would have been written in that diary
 dhire dhire vijay ko don kebaare main or adhik jaankaree milti jaati he, or ek din roma kii sahaayta se vah ghoshnaa kar detaa he, ki uski yaaddasht waapas aa chuki he
 In this happiness, there is a party, in which the police raid falls

 After this, he starts thinking of himself with the help of Roma to prove himself innocent
 vijay is ghatnakram main buree tarah ulajh jaataa he, kyonki police yah maanane se manaa karti he ki vah vijay hai, or saath hi don ke anderworld giroh ko yah ehsaas ho jaataa he ki vah vastav main don nahin hai
 The red diary from above, which he gave to DCP d'silva, steals Jasjeet
