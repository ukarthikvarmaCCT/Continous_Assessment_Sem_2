 Although a common process of planning for all types of enterprises cannot be determined, the following process can be followed in a rational business planning: uddeshy sanstha ke sadhano ko dhyaan main rakhkar nishchit kiye jane chahie tathaa vebodhgamy evam vaastavik hone chahie
 Objectives are the target points of the work to be done and determine the path of desired results

 But the real purpose of the magician is to seduce Aladdin and obtain a magic lamp from him which is present in a magical cave
 jaadugar alladin ko dhokaa dene kii koshish karata he jisase alladin gupha main funs jaataa he
 Due to good luck, he has a magic ring that was given to him by the magician
 jab hataash hokar alladin apane haath ghisata he tab anjaane main usase anguthi bhi ghis jaati he or ek jinn prakat hota he jo use apni maan ke paas ghar pahunchaa detaa he

 The way a word is spoken; Or a language is spoken; Or someone speaks a word; Call it "her accent"
 bhashavigyaan main uccharan ke shastreey adhyayan ko dhvanivigyaan kii sangya di jaati he
 The pronunciation of a language is noticed only when there is an extravagance in it, such as vibhinn log yaa vibhinn samudaay ek hi shabd ko alag-alag tareeke se bolte hai
 The style of speaking a word depends on many factors
 in karkon main pramukh hai - kis kshetra main vyakti rahakar bada hua he; vyakti main koi vaak-vikaar he yaa nahin; vyakti kaa saamaajik varg; vyakti kii shiksha, aadi The pronunciation of the words written in Devanagari scripts is fixed, but in Roman, Urdu etc
 scripts, the spelling of words has very little correlation with the pronunciation
 isaliye angreji, french aadi bhashaaon ke shabdon ke uccharan ko bataane ke liye antararashtriya dhvanyatmak varnmaala lipi yaa audio file yaa kisi anya vidhi kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 But the spelling of the words of Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit, Nepali etc
 is sufficient for their pronunciation
 uccharan ke antargat pradhanthya teen baaten aati hai : The difference in the pronunciation of a person or class makes a difference
 kabhi-kabhi dhvaniyon ke uccharansthaan main bhi kuch bhed paae jate hai
 Practical use of pronunciation studies is generally used in three areas: yadhyapi sansar kii bhinn-bhinn bhashaaon ke uccharan main samanta kaa ansh adhik paaya jaataa he, tathaapi saath hi prayek bhashaa ke uccharan main kuch visheshtaayen bhi milti hai, jaise bhartiya bhashaaon kii murdhanya dhvaniyaan t th d aadi, farsi arabi kii anek sangharshi dhvaniyaan jese kh g za aadi, hindi kii boliyon main theth brajabhasha ke uccharan main ardhvivruth swar ain, on, bhojpuri main shabdon ke uccharan main antya swaraghaat
 Spoken forms of languages, ie pronunciation, are written by scriptmarks, although not all features of pronunciation are included in this form
 varnmaalaon kaa avishkaar prachinkaal main kisi ek bhashaa ko lipibaddh karne ke liye hua tha, kintu aaj prayek varnmaala anek sambhddha athwa asambaddha bhashaaon ko likhane main prayukt hone lagi he jinamein anek pracheen dhvaniyaan lupt or naveen dhvaniyaan viksit ho gai hai
 Again, often alphabets do not characterize the heart, long, accented, lyrical accentuation etc
 is prakaar bhashaaon ke likhit rup se unki uccharan sambandhi samast visheshtaon par prakaash nahin padataa
 International phonetic script based on Roman script is often used in linguistics texts to avoid the above mentioned defects of popular alphabets
 kintu is lipi main bhi uccharan kii samast visheshtaon kaa samavesh nahin ho sakaa he
 Their study is possible only with the help of "tape record" or "linguaphone" of the language
 bhashaa ke likhit rup kaa prabhaav kabhi-kabhi bhashaa ke uccharan par bhi padataa he, visheshtya aise varg ke uccharan par jo bhashaa ko likhit rup ke madhyam se sikhta he; jaise hindibhashi "vah' ko praaia: "wo' bolte hai, yadhyapi likhte "vah' hai
 non-hindi speakers always speak "he" because of the influence of the written form
 prayek bhashaa ke sambandh main adarsh uccharan kii bhaavana sadaa vartmaan rahi he
 Generally speaking, the pronunciation of the elite citizen of the principal political or literary center of every language is considered ideal
 kintu yah aavashyak nahin he ki iskaa safal anukaran nirantar ho sake
 This is the reason that in the pronunciation of each language, there is always more or less variety in the pronunciation
 kisi bhashaa ke uccharan kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karne yaa karaane ke liye dhvanivigyaan kii jaankaree aavashyak he
 With the help of experimental phonology, very precise analysis of pronunciation characteristics is possible
 kintu uccharan ke is vaigyanik vishleshan ke kuch hi anshon kaa vyaavhaarik upyog sambhav ho paata he

 He is the investor who maintains the investment
 ek doosraa laabh ye bhi hota he, ki chote niveshak bahut kam raashi jaise 100 ru
pratimah tak nivesh kar sakate hai

 Investors can choose the plan that best fits the investment objectives and goals
 jo niveshak kisi vishesh share ke liye kol nahin chaahate ve suchakank aadhaarit yojana yani index skim main nivesh kar sakate hai kyonki index skim un vishesh sheyaron main hi nivesh karti he jo kisi vishesh index kaa hissaa hote hai

 Close ended funds cannot issue any new units under the scheme except bonus or right issue
 is hi kaaran se open anded yojana kii unit puunji main share kii hi tarah utaar chadhaav ho sakate hai, jabaki close anded ke maamle main aisa nahin hota
 An open-ended scheme can be entered or exited at any time and sometimes has a lock-in period, which cannot contain redemption, so it should be fixed at the time of admission
 close anded yojana main sabsakripshan ek hi baar liya ja saktaa he or reedenpshan bhi nunatam tay samay seemaa ke antaraal par hi ho saktaa he
 In this way the liquidity of the close ended scheme is reduced

 When any fund house in the market launches a new scheme, then all the rules, conditions and other things related to it are essentially made available to the Securities and Exchange Board of India
 yah jaankaree jis dastavej ke dwaara sebi ko di jaati he, use 'skim kaa ofer document' kehete hai
 In this, sufficient information related to the purpose of investment, risk factors, load and other expenses are given
 mutual fund sanchaalan karne main adwijuri, castodial, audit transfar agent va trustee fees or agent kamishan aadi kai madon main vyay hota he, ofer document main in madon main kiye jane vaale vyay ke bare main puri di gai hoti he
 Apart from this, it is also said that what are the charges that the investor will have to pay when investing in the scheme, such as entry load, exit load, switching charges, recurring expenses etc
 jis yojana main kharche kam aate hon, fund house ke paas niveshak ke liye rakam adhik hogi or isse ritern bhi adhik milane kii ummid banegi
 Such schemes are more beneficial for investors
 kisi bhi yojana ke tahat 65 pratishat se adhik rakam yadi equity main lagaai jane vaali he to aisi yojana ko equity yojana kaha jaataa he
 If the company is going to invest equal amount in equity and debt, then such scheme is covered under the balanced scheme

 cobraon se muthbhed ke baad, ricki kii pehali asal ladaai karait naamak ek bhure saanp se hoti he, jo jon ke bete tedi ko dasna chahta he
 This snake is a much more dangerous enemy than a cobra, due to its deadly venom and small size, but the mongoose kills it and the family, in gratitude to his pet, calls him "our mongoose"
 raat main jab sab so jate hai tab ricki apane ghar ke aasapaas tahalne ke liye baahar chalaa jaataa he or uski mulaakaat "chhuchhundra" naamak chhachhundar se hoti he, jo use bataata he ki bageeche main rahane vaale uske chachere bhai "chua" jo ek chuha he, ne use bataaya he ki naag or nagina kuch khatarnaak karne kii yojana bana rahe hai

 Rikki narrowly escapes from the bullets, but Nag is split into two and thrown into a dustbin where Nagina celebrates her mourning and vows to retaliate her death

 haal ke varshon main ameks ne anya bainkon ko ameks kii ore se praapt yaa jari karne ke liye adhikrut karnaa prarambh kiya he, ne ke liye yaa to adhigrahan shuru ho gaya he yaa Amex ore, mudda mukhya rup se deshon main, jahaan Amex anyathaa kam yaa koi upasthiti hoga
