 International relations is the study of relations between different countries, as well as the role of sovereign states, inter-governmental organizations, international ngos, non-governmental organizations and multinationals
 anterrashtriya sambandh ko kabhi-kabhi 'antararashtriya adhyayan' ) ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, haalanki donon shabd puri tarah se paryaay nahin hai
 In simple terms, 'international politics' means 'doing politics among states'
 yadi 'raajnneeti' ke arth kaa adhyayan karen to teen pramukh tatv saamne aate hai - samoohon kaa astitv; samoohon ke bich sahmati; tathaa samoohon dwaara apane hiton kii purti
 If we assess this effect internationally, then these three elements are mainly - the existence of states; Conflict between states; And the use of power to fulfill their national interests
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti un kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa he jiske antargat rajya apane raashtra hiton kii purti hetu shakti ke aadhaar par sangharshrat rahete hai
 In this context, national interests are the main goals of international politics; Conflict sets its direction; And Shakti is considered as the main means of achieving this objective
 parantu uparyukt paribhaasha ko ham paramparaagat maan sakate hai, kyonki aaj ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ kaa sthaan isse vyapak avadharana ‘antarrashtriya sambandhon’ ne le liya he
 Under this, along with mutual conflict of states, the collaborative aspects are now studied under international politics
 iske atirikt aaj ‘rajyon’ ke alaava anya kai kaarak bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ban gaye hai
 Therefore, under this, individuals, institutions, organizations and many other non-state units have also joined
 iskaa vartmaan aadhaar va vishay kshetra aaj kaaphi vyapak swaroop le chukaa he
 Before discussing all these topics, it becomes very essential to review the following definitions given by different scholars- in paribhaashaon kaa dayera ati simit he, kyonki iske antargat multah ‘rajyon’ ko hi anterrashtriya raajnneeti ke kaarak ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is limited to the nature of international politics
 mukhya rup se hence je
 margenthau, herald spraoot, bone doyak, thampsan aadi iske mukhya samarthak hai jo inaki nimna paribhaashaon se spasht ho jaataa he- International definitions discuss the broad nature of international politics, international relations
 isamen rajya ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke naveen karkon jaise antarrashtriya sanghathan, deshaantar samooh, gaiyr sarkari sanghathan, antarrashtriya santhaayen, kuch vyaktiyon aadi ko bhi sammilit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, along with the struggle, cooperation and politics, as well as directly or indirectly affecting it, ie, cultural, religious, social, science and technical aspects are also mentioned
 vibhinn lekhakon kii nimnlikhit paribhaashaon se yah aashay ati spasht rup main ujagar ho jaataa he- In this way the nature of international politics becomes very broad from the beginning to the present
 isamen aaj raashtra rajyon ke saath vibhinn vishwa ikaayiyon evam sanghathanon ke adhyayan kaa samavesh ho chukaa he
 But even after all these changes, the focal point of these studies is still a nation state
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ke bare main nimna nishkarsh saamne aate hai
 Therefore, the nature of international politics is variable
 jab-jab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke parivesh, karkon va ghatnakram main parivartan aayegaa, iske adhyayan karne ke tareekon va drushtikonon main bhi parivartan anivaary he
 Additionally, this change is continuous rather than permanent
 iske saath-saath vibhinn karkon, staron, ayaamon aadi ke kaaran yah bahut jatil he atah iske sucharu adhyayan hetu bahut spasht, tarksangat, vyapak drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As is known from the above definitions and form, the subject area of international politics is increasing
 aaj iskaa vishay kshetra kaaphi vyapak ho gaya he jiske antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- Therefore, today the subject area of international politics is very broad and complex and is moving towards development
 iske antargat vibhinn paramparaagat karkon ke saath-saath gaiyr-paramparaagat karkon kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn hota ja rahaa he
 The history of the development of international politics is not very ancient, rather the subject is a product of the twentieth century
 spasht rup se dekha jaae to velj vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya woodro wilson peeth kii 1919 main sthapana se hi iskaa itihaas prarambh hota he

 isi samay anya vishvavidhyalayon evam sansthaanon main bhi isi prakaar kii vyavasthaaen dekhne ko mili
 Therefore, if we look at the history of this subject in the last one century, then along with the ups and downs in this subject, information about its establishment in an autonomous subject is available
 is vishay main aaye bahuaiami parivartanon ne jahaan ek ore vishaywastu kaa sanvardhan, samanvay tathaa vikaas kiya he, vahiin duusari ore vibhinn siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke bahut si jatil samasyaon evam pahaluon ko samajhane main sahaayta pradaan kii he
 Kenneth Thompson in his 1962 review, Review of Politics, has divided the history of international politics into four parts, on the basis of which a clear and sure study of this subject can be possible
 vikaas ke in chaar charnon main shityudhottar yug ke paanchaven charan ko bhi sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their detailed description is as follows: pratham vishwayuddh se purv itihaas, kanoon, raajnneeti shaastra, darshan shaastra aadi ke vidwaan hi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke alag-alag pahaluon par vichaar karte the
 It was mainly historians who studied it as diplomatic history and the history of relations with other countries
 iske antargat kootneetigyon va videsh mantriyon dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kaa lekha jokha hota tha
 Hence, it is also known as diplomatic history
 i
ech
car ke anusaar pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh kaa sambandh keval sainikon tak samajha jaataa tha tathaa iske samakaksh antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa sambandh rajanyikon tak
 In addition, even in democratic countries, foreign policy was traditionally kept separate from party politics and the elected members also felt unable to control the foreign ministry
 1919 se purv is vishay ke prati udaseenta ke kai pramukh kaaran the - pratham, is samay tak yahi samajha jaataa tha ki yuddh va rajyon main gathbandhan usee prakaar swaabhaavik he jaise garibi va berogari
 Therefore, preventing war, foreign policy and mutual relations between states was considered out of the control of human power
 dwitiya, pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh itane bhayankar nahin hote the
 Third, in the absence of means of communication, international politics was limited to a few states
 is prakaar is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan kii sabase badi kami saamaanya hiton kaa vikaas rahaa
 In this period, only a descriptive study of diplomatic history was done
 parinamswaroop, isse na to vartmaan tathaa na hi bhavi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane main koi madad mili
 The quantum achievement of this era was the establishment of the Chair of the Study of International Politics at the University of Wales in 1919
 do vishwa yudhon ke bich ke kaal main do samaanaantar dhaaraon kaa vikaas hua
 The first of which emphasized the study of current events / problems, except for the dominance of earlier historicity
 iske saath saath ab aitihaasik raajnneetik adhyayan ko vartmaan raajnneetik sandarbhon ke saath jod kar dekhne kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 Despite the diminishing of historical influence, there still remains a lack of a holistic approach to the study of international politics
 is kaal main vartmaan ke adhyayan par to bahut bal diya gaya, lekin vartmaan evam ateet ke parsparik sambandh ke mahatv ko abhi bhi pahachaanaa nahin gaya
 In addition, neither was there an attempt to see post-war political problems with comparable problems of the past
 shaayad isiilie is yug main bhi do moolbhoot kamiyaan spasht rup se ujagar raheen
 First, like the first phase, universal principles could not develop in international politics even in this period
 dwitiya, aaj bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa adhyayan adhik suspasht evam tarksangat nahin ban paaya
 Thus, in this phase, there was not much change in the study of international politics except the change in the status of force, nor was the confirmation of this subject becoming an explicitly independent discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa tritiy charan bhi dwitiya charan ke samaanaantar do vishwa yudhon ke bich kaa kaal rahaa
 It is called the era of reformism because it envisaged reform of international politics through the establishment of the League of Nations by the states
 is yug main mukhya rup se sansthagat vikaas kiya gaya
 The scholars, diplomats, politicians and thinkers of this period believed that if international institutions are developed, then the problems of war and peace present in front of the world community will be possible
 is uddeshy hetu kuch kanoonee va naitik upagamon kii sanrachanaayen kii gai jinke nimna mukhya aadhaar the
 International organization was envisaged with emphasis on these ideals and moral values
 isaki sthapana ke uparant yah mana gaya ki ab antarrashtriya sambandhon main rajyon ke madhya shaanti banane kaa sangharsh samaapt ho gaya
 There will be no place of balance of power under the new system
 ab rajya apane vivaadon kaa nipataara sangh ke madhyam se karenge
 Therefore, in this era not only the problems of war and peace were discussed, but its far-reaching reforms were also thought of
 atah adhyayankartaaon ke mukhya bindu bhi kanoonee samasyaon va sanghathanon ke vikaas ke saath-saath inke madhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ko badalane vaala rahaa
 Finally, in this period more emphasis has been laid on emotional, imaginative and moral reformism
 parantu vishwayudhon ke bich in upagamon kii sarthakata par hameshaa prashn chihn laga rahaa
 While the first decade of United Nations activities showed a ray of hope, the economic situation of the second decade completely ended this notion
 badi shaktiyon ke madhya asahyog va gutbandiyon ne shaanti kii sthapana kii bajaay shakti sangharsh vyavastha ko janm diya
 While Japan invaded Manchuria and disrupted peace, Italy, Germany and Russia not only relinquished membership of the League in controversial situations, but also intensified the process of the start of World War II

 The fundamental changes in international politics at this stage not only broadened its content but also led to many complications
 shitayugin kaal main raajnneeti ke swaroop main parivartan tathaa naye rajyon ke udai ne sampoorn antarrashtriya parivesh ko hi badal diya
 As a result, new approaches, dimensions, institutions and trends were created through which the study of international relations was ensured
 purv charnon kii aadarshik, sansthagat, naitik, kanoonee evam sudhaarwadi dhaaraon kii asafalataaon ne naye upagamon ke vikaas kii ore agrasar kiya
 This new approach was realism
 vaise to i

car, shwarjanbarger, quinci rhit, shubhaan aadi lekhakon ne is drushtikon ko viksit kiya, parantu hence je
 margenthau ne ise ek saamaanya siddhanth ke rup main prastut kiya
 According to this theory, states are always struggling to fulfill their interests
 atah anterrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane hetu is shakti sangharsh ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhnaa ati aavashyak he
 International organization also originated in the form of assured and unambiguous development of international institutions with realistic outlook
 ab is sanghathan kaa swaroop maatra adarshavaadi va sudhaarwadi na hokar, mahatvapurn raajnneetik sanghathan ke rup main ubhar kar aayaa
 Under this, apart from saving mankind from the ravages of war, what are the reasons for the conflict between the states? What are the risk factors for world peace? How can peace be established? How can arms race be stopped? Efforts were also made to find solutions to many types of questions
 uparokt do pravritiyon ke saath-saath vyavahaarwad kii utpatti bhi is yug kii mahatvapurn uplabdhi rahi
 An attempt was made to understand international politics by creating "system theory" through a pragmatic approach
 is upaagam ke antargat rajyon ke adhyayan hetu teen pramukh karkon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa zaruri mana gaya
 These factors were- uparokt pravritiyon kaa mukhya bal antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saiddhantikaran ko badhaava dena rahaa he
 Therefore, it has been a very important task in this era to propose the universal principles of international politics
 siddhanth nirmaan kii is prakriya ke parinaam swaroop anek aanshik siddhanton jaise - yatharthwaad, santulan kaa siddhanth, sanchaar siddhanth, krida siddhanth, saudebaaji kaa siddhanth, shaanti anusandhan drushtikon, vyavastha siddhanth, vishwa vyavastha pratimaan aadi kaa nirmaan hua
 Despite the rendering of these principles, there still remains a lack of any universal and common principle in this era
 1990 ke dashak main jaint bandhopadhyaay ne apni pustak - general theory of international rilations - main martin kaplan ke vyavasthaaparak siddhanth kii kamiyon ko dur kar ek saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana kii koshish kii he, parantu vah bhi abhi vaad-pratwaad ke daur main hi hai
 Therefore, despite the main phase of theorization, the era of the Cold War remained deprived of any one general principle due to its ideological narrowness and isolation
 shityudhottar yug main sabhi rashtron dwaara ek aarthik vyavastha ke antargat judana prarambh kar diya
 That is why the era of globalization, liberalization, free market system etc
 has started
 is sandarbh main na keval aarthik muddon kaa hi mahatv badha, apitu antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa mahatv or bhi bad gaya
 Today, the distinction of nationalism and internationalism has ended
 Apart from this, now the table of international politics has included a lot of new topics which, instead of being national, now emerge as problems of mankind
 vartmaan vishwa kii pramukh samasyaon main aatankwaad, paryaavaran, ozon parat ksheen hona, nashile padaarthon evam maadak dravyon kii taskari, maanavadhikaron kaa hanan aadi pramukh mudde ubhar kar saamne aaye jinka rashtriya str yaa kshetray str kii bajaay antarrashtriya str par hal nikaalnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 Even at the theoretical level, the attempt to establish the universal principle from 1945 to 1991 got a shock
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii is sandarbh main ab praathamiktaayen badal gai
 In post-modernism, the significance of universal principles are now being questioned
 aitihaasik sandarbh evam pracheen parivesh ke prabhaav ko bhi nakaara ja rahaa he
 Now the independent issues have become more important
 vrihat siddhanth gaun ho gaye hai
 Partial research has become more important in the new context
 udhaahranswaroop nariwad, maanavadhikaar, paryaavaran aadi vishyon par adhik bal dene ke saath-saath chintan bhi prarambh ho gaya he
 Therefore, in the post-cold War era, the nature, content and subject area of international politics have completely changed
 ab saamaanya saiddhanthik sthapana par bhi adhik bal nahin diya ja rahaa he
 That is why, in this changed environment, international politics seems to be not only important but also towards autonomy
 or vishay kii swaittata hetu ashaavadi sanket dikhaai dete hai
 The Second World War not only influenced international politics fundamentally, but also expressed many important issues
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke karkon main parivartan, karkon ko vyapak swaroop pradaan karnaa, naveen siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aadi anek vishyon ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa purna parivesh hi badal kar rakh diya he
 While there is a debate on the theoretical level of realism and idealism on the one hand, and on the ancient and scientific debate, on the other hand controversial questions were being raised about the format of international relations topic - whether international relations is a Autonomous subject or not? Although it is being taught as an autonomous subject at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and research in most universities today, it is not recognized as equivalent to other subjects of social science
 itnaa avashya hua he ki viksit deshon main to kai vishvavidhyalayon main ise purna rup se swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Developing countries like India have also improved
 yahaan prarambh main ‘bhartiya antarrashtriya sambandh skool, nai dilli’ jo baad main jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya sambandh skool ke rup main swytt rup se kaary kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, many other universities like Jadavpur University, Calcutta, Goa University etc
 have also got the status of autonomous subjects
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ko ek swytt vishay ke rup main adhyayan karne se purv ek baat spasht kerani ati aavashyak he ki jab ham is vishay kii swaittata ke prashn kaa adhyayan karte hai to ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ va antarrashtriya sambandhon ko alag-alag vishay nahin maanate hai
 This has been done because both disciplines are still recognized as a sub-discipline of the subject of political science rather than as an autonomous discipline
 duusare inkaa vibhed itnaa sookshm he ki anushaasan kii swaittata kii pramanikta ke baad is vishay ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the context of considering international politics as an autonomous subject, three different views have been given which are as follows - jo vidwaan is vishay ko swytt maanate hai unke anusaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay vastu va anushaasan sambandhi saamagree ko dekhte hue ise ek swytt vishay mana janaa chahie
 The main proponents of this argument are - CAW
 Manning, Quincy Right, Robert Lotting Allen, Hannes J
 Margenthau, Carl M
 Copper Johnson, Hoffmann; AL Burn etc
 in vidwaanon ne nimna aadhaaron par ise swytt vishay pramanit kiya he- Those scholars who do not consider international politics as an autonomous subject, believe that there is no such unique thing in this subject that it should be considered autonomous for study
 unhone nimna tarko ke aadhaar par apni baat kaa samarthan kiya he- Some scholars consider both of the above debates as meaningless
 unka maananaa yah he ki uparyukt donon tarkon ko antarrashtriya raajnneeti main hue vikaas ke madhyam se adhik bhalee prakaar se janaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, a review of the development of the 20th century, and especially after 1945, is extremely essential
 yadi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii swaittata ke prashn kaa gahan adhyayan karte hai to pataa chalata he ki is sandarbh main do moolbhoot samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 One, there have been effective changes in the nature, content and methods of international relations
 doosraa, isi samay raajnneetishastra kii paridhi kii jatiltaaon evam aparibhaashit simaaon ke vikaas ke kaaran samasya or bad gai he
 But if we look at the development of international politics from 1919 till date, it is clear that its achievements will prove very helpful in giving it autonomy
 1919 ke baad se hi, visheshkar america main, bahut se vidwaanon ne is vishay ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane hetu prayaas kiye hai
 Efforts have also been made to explain its content, methods and principles

 After a review in this context, Richard Smythbeel has come to the conclusion that- dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad is sthiti main mahatvapurn parivartan aae hai
 On the one hand, on the one hand, based on new researches in this field, the international relations analytic relations have been strengthened, on the other hand new theories have also been formulated
 america main anek viddhanon mukhya rup se margenthau, richard snidar, martin kaplan, karl dablyoo dois, charles mekalaland aadi ne is ore vishisht yogadan diya he
 In addition, emphasis has been laid on the study of both developed and developing countries
 isaki vishay saamagree kaa sankalan, siddhanth pratipaadan evam paddatiyon kaa bhi kaaphi vikaas hua he
 But even today, the most important deficiency remains the lack of a universal / general principle
 shityudhottar vishwa main iskaa mahatv or bad gaya he
 In this era of globalization, all the states are getting connected with one type of economic system
 antarrashtriya va rashtriya mudde jaise paryaavaran, aatankwaad, nariwad, adj, ozon parat ksheen hona, maanavadhikaar aadi rashtriya kii bajaay maanviya / maanavjaati se sambhddha ho gaye hai
 Therefore, active participation of international forums / organizations is necessary to solve all these
 ab saarvbhaumik siddhanth ko bhi uttar aadhunikwaad kii drushti se nakaar kar vyaktiparak evam sthaneey aadhaar par adhik bal diya gaya he
 Therefore, on the basis of the development after 1945, it can be said to be leading to autonomy, which after 1991 the process of the end of the Cold War has tried to strengthen

 In this longevity of 91 years, Hobbs saw many socio-political uprisings and changes - the rise of the middle class, the struggle of the Stuart kings and the parlance, the execution of Charles I, the rule and restoration of Cramwell, the importance of Hobbs peace and security due to his innate fervor
 Used to give englad ke grihayuddh ne uske is vichaar ko or bhi drudh kar diya ki parsparik kalah or yuddh sabhy jivan ke liye ghaatak he
 Although Hobbes took the side of the king in a quarrel with the parliament and the king, his arguments supported any power that could establish peace and order
 habs kaa darshan galileo, kepler, decort tathaa gasendi jaise vaigyanikon kii dharanaon se anupranit he
 It is said that his aim was to tie the whole of human science into a formula and establish it on the scientific foundation
 kintu habs ke darshan or tatkaaleen vigyaan main vaastavik sambandh kya he, yah vivaadaaspad he
 Leau Strauss holds that although Hobbes's thinking has been presented in scientific form, its source is classical humanism, not modern materialism
 galileo or kepler kii khoj ke purv habs par thumidides tathaa arestu kaa amit prabhaav pad chukaa tha
 According to Gaikel Oak Schott, the basic inspiration of Hobbes's philosophy is not scientific materialism, but philosophical intellectualism — a particular notion about the nature of philosophy
 yah dharna vigyaan or darshan ko mitra maanati he
 Hobbs' philosophy is the world reflected in the mirror of wisdom
 is darpan main dekhne se vishwa yantravat dikhaai detaa he chaahe, vah vastut: yantra na ho
 That is why intellectual deliberation of human society can also be done by considering it mechanically
 habs pradhanat: raajnneetik vichaarak he
 But his philosophy is a part of his general philosophy
 is darshan kii visheshta he- jyamiti kii nigamanaatmak pranali
 The belief of this system is rationalism
 habs kaa buddhivaad plato, saint tamas tathaa spinoja ke buddhivaad se bhinn he
 It is under the post-medieval nominalist tradition
 habs ke darshan main buddhi kaa sthaan gaun he, pradhanta ichhashakti tathaa manobhaavon kii he
 Wisdom is an art or means by which correct conclusions can be drawn from predetermined vows
 ye pratigyaayen sarvatha swakalpit hoti hai
 Thus, the second characteristic of philosophical knowledge is its imaginary form
 darshan ko habs kaary kaaran-gyaan kahata he or karan ko purvavarti gati maanata he
 All knowledge is obtained by variation of speed

 Geometry is concerned with the motion of points and lines, the physical movement of atoms; Psychology is a description of the neurotransmitters within the human body and is the result of a synthetic movement produced by the reciprocal trauma of state individuals
 is prakaar uparyukt sabhi shaastra vibhinn roopon main ek hi vishay kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Hobbs does not explain how the physical and human world can be interpreted on deductive systems of geometry based on hypothetical theorems

 There are two types of movements in the human body due to the movement of motion in the external world - attraction and distraction
 manovaigyanik str par unhen ichha or vidwesh kehete hai
 Human beings are attracted towards the things which help in life and he escapes from those whose life is destroyed
 vaanchit vastuen shubh kahi jaati hai or avaanchit ashubh
 Since the things that protect and enhance life are limited and all individuals are almost equal, combining their somatic and mental powers, a rivalry begins to attain and store the desired things which soon lead to the struggle for glory and power
 As a result
 is sangharsh kaa paryavsaan keval mrityu main hota he kyonki shaktilipsaa anant hoti he
 There is no place for discretion and decorum in it

 In such a situation there is a complete lack of civilization, culture and business
 nyaay anyaay kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 Whatever a person can do for his life saving is his natural right
 prakritik adhikaar keval prakritik shakti se hi simit hote hai
 The natural state is the result of man's immense pride, selfishness and uncontrolled emotion
 kintu is bhayaavah paristhiti se mukti dilaanevaali buddhi bhi usamen viddhman rahati he
 Through intelligence, man searches for natural laws that provide peace and increase the chances of lifeline
 prakritik vidhaan yah shiksha detaa he ki pratidwandvita or hinsa aatmaraksha ke shatru hai, sahyog tathaa shanti hi uske vaastavik saadhan hai
 Therefore, every person should try to find peace
 yadi anya vyakti bhi is baat ke liye taiyaar hon to use apane aseem prakritik adhikaron ko chhodane tathaa dusron ke viruddh utani hi swatantraaa se santusht rahane ke liye tatpar hona chahie jitani vah apane viruddh dusron ko dene ke liye udyat ho
 Human beings should behave in accordance with their promises because society can be established only by mutual trust and contract
 prakritik vidhaan rajya ke liye aavashyak hai kintu habs apane ahanvaadi manovigyaan se unka sanmajasya sthapit nahin kar paata
 If a human being is an intelligent creature, then this terrible picture of the natural state is untrue and if this picture is real then it is meaningless to expect such beings to live in society
 phir prakritik vidhaan naitik vidhaan he athwa keval upyogita ke niyam, yah spasht nahin he
 Of course, they are morally bound to take the form of the command of God or sovereign
 kintu samprabhu se aadisht hote ke purv unki baadhyataa naitik he athwa keval bauddhik is vishay main vidwanon main matbhed he
 Hobbs also says that a contract without power is useless
 at: naitik tathaa bauddhik rup se baadhya hone par bhi vyakti ko rajya kaa ajnapaalan karne ke liye bhautik bandhan kii aavashyaktaa he
 By contract each individual transfers his or her unlimited natural rights to another person, or group of individuals, who is responsible for the peace and security of all
 sambida kaa ang ne hone ke kaaran yah vyakti, yaa vyaktisamooh, kisi bhi maanviya kanoon se baadhya nahin he
 He is the representative of all persons

 The sovereignty embodied therein is indivisible, infinitely irrevocable and permanent

 Its orders are law and while the law is silent, the public is free

 Apart from contract, the state can be established by conquest but there is no elemental difference between the two

 His influence on Bentham's utilitarianism and Austin's sovereignty theory is clear
 yadhyapi usne nirankush samprabhutaa kaa samarthan kiya, tathaapi vyaktvaad uske darshan kii aadharshila he
 He considers unnecessary interference of the state in the life of a person undesirable, while giving the sovereign unlimited power
 phir, vyakti kii rajbhakti kii aadhaar he samprabhu kii suraksha tathaa shanti pradaan karne kii kshamta
 If it cannot do so, the public is free to choose another ruler

 This language is also spoken in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Chhattisgarh apart from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
 telegu ke teen naam prachlit hai -- "telegu", "tenugu" or "andhra"
 The word Andhra is used in the Rigvedic Aitareya Brahmana
 telegu shabd kaa mularoop sanskrit main "triling" he
 It refers to the Shivalinga of Mallikarjuna Linga, Kaleshwar and Draksharama of Srisail in Andhra Pradesh
 in teenon simaaon se ghira desh trillingdesh or yahan kii bhashaa triling kahalaai
 This word is used in the Mahabharata of the Telugu Adi-poet "nannay Bhatt"
 yah shabd trinag shabd se bhi utpann hua mana jaataa he
 It means this region spread in the middle range of three big mountains
 andhra janata uttar disha se dakshin kii ore jab hataai gai to dakshinvasi hone ke kaaran is pradesh or bhashaa ko "tenugu" naam diya gaya
 
 tenugu naam hone kaa ek or kaaran bhi he
 In Tenugu, your word means honey
 yah bhashaa madhumadhur hone ke kaaran tenugu naam se prasiddh he
 This region is also known by the name "veginam"
 "vegi" kaa arth he krishna godavari nadiyon kaa madhyadesh jo ek baar jal gaya tha
 This name is not applicable to the language

 telegu bhashaa ke vikaas ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke do mat hai
 According to Dr
 Chilukuri Narayana Rao, the Telugu language is not of the Dravidian family but is Prakritjanya and is especially related to the Paisachi language
 iske vipareet bishap cardwell or korad ramakrishnayya aadi vidwaanon ke mat se telegu bhashaa kaa sambandh dravid parivaar se hi he
 Whatever it is, it has developed from the conference of both types of languages
 aajkal uparyukt teen naamon se prachlit is bhashaa main lagbhag 75 pratishat sanskrit shabdon kaa sammishran he
 The root cause of its sweetness is a combination of Sanskrit and Telugu
 pashchim ke vidwaanon ne bhi telegu ko "purv kii italeey bhashaa" kahkar iske maadhurya kii saraahna kii he
 Scripts for almost all sounds are found in this language
 isaki visheshta yah he ki hrasv e, o, dantya c, za evam shakat ref naam se ek adhik "r" ke atirikt ardhabindu or "l" bhi is bhashaa main he
 In this way, six letters are found more in the Telugu alphabet than in the Sanskrit alphabet
 praaia: sanskrit ke mangal, taal or kala aadi shabdon ke "l" varna telegu main "l" se uccharit hote hai
 Ardhanusvara does not exist in pronunciation, but to know the sequence of language, it is necessary to write it
 kuch shabd ek hi prakaar se uccharit hote hue bhi ardhanuswaar ke samavesh se bhinn-bhinn arth dete he
 For example, "edu" means seven numbers
 usee ko ardhanusaar se 'endu' shabd likhaa jaae to iskaa arth varsh arthath sanvatsar hota he
 Telugu Swaraant Yane is the "ajant" language while Hindi is "vyanjnant" or "halant Bhasha"
 swarant bhashaa hone ke kaaran telegu sangeet ke liye atyant upyukt maani gai he
 Thus, 90 percent of the words in Carnatic music are found in Telugu
 telegu lipi motiyon kii maala ke samaan sundar prathit hoti he
 The letters are round

 Bhopal Singh was the grandson of Shardul Singh
 yah pataa chalaa he ki prasiddh khetadi mahal kisi bhi prakaar ke daravaaje yaa khidkiyaan se rahit he isiilie ise hawa mahal ke rup main janaa ja rahaa he

 khetadi mahal galiyon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke peeche sthit he
 It is considered one of the reliable examples of Shekhawati art and architecture
 yah mukhya rup se bhitti chitron or uttam saraniyon ke liye janaa jaataa he jo ki raghunatha mandir or bhopalgarh kile se samarthit he
 Its peculiarity lies in the continuous flow of air, which always sets it apart from many other such buildings of this structure
 khambhe jo kabhi sambhavatya mahal main hawa ke satat pravaah banaae rakhane ke liye jane jate the ab unhone vishaal diwaar sanrachanaon jagah le lee he
 a long ramp from the entrance to the palace's large terrace can attract anyone's foremost attention

 in ramp kaa ek anya uddeshy 'thakuron' bahut prayaas ke bina unke vishyon par neeche takataki karne ke liye paryaapt ucch manch pradaan karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 The view from the terrace is particularly worth observing

 Most of these paintings were in natural earth pigments

 These arches and columns provide a beautiful symmetrical view to the palace
 sadiyon puraani chuunaa plaster apane swayan ke mahima ke liye chhod diya gaya he or yah ek gulabi chamak he
 Although Khetri Mahal is no doubt one of the rare and unique structures of the Shekhawati era, the helpless state of this building is an unfortunate truth
 is tarah kii vaastukala durlabh he or jald hi lupt ho sakati he
 Maintaining it, preserving and murals of these unique structures can surely be a huge boost to our Indian tourism and culture

aspx Template: Victoria Beckham Template: Spice Girls dharmraj se nimnlikhit vyaktiyon kaa bodh hota he- Ledger or ledger is the main book in which the transactions of money are kept accountable
 aajkal yah computer-file ke rup main bhi hoti he
 All the transactions in the ledger are written according to the account in which there are two separate columns of debited and credited
 lekhankan kaa ek uddeshy sugamawa se yah nishchit karnaa he vyapaaree ko apane lendaaron ko kya dena he, use apane dendaaron se kya lenaa he, uske vyay or aay kay he ityadi
 It is also clear that this information cannot be obtained immediately just by writing the deals in the journal
 mana ki ek vyakti yah jaananaa chahta he ki use 'k' se kya lenaa athwa dena he to use 'k' se sambandhit pravishtiyon ko dhundhane ke liye puraa rojnaamachaa dekhnaa padegaa kyonki usne usase kai baar maal kharida hoga or kai baar use dhan diya hoga
 If this method is used to identify your position with each person or firm dealing with them, then the purpose of writing the same account will be finally achieved
 iske atirikt iskaa arth hoga samay, urja, evam dhan kii vyarth barwaadi
 Therefore, any quick means should be obtained to write all the entries related to each individual or firm
 yah sab pravishtiyon ko ek or pustak main, jise khatabahi kehete hai, ekatrit or sankshipt karke kiya jaataa he
 All the entries related to each person which till now were scattered in the Roznamcha are collected and abridged at one place
 bottleboy ke anusaar khatabahi khaaton kii mukhya pustak he or isi pustak main saare vyapaarik len-dein ant main vibhajit hokar apane-apane khaaton main sthaan praapt karte hai
 According to Peakles, 'account is the most important book of accounts and is the floor of entries made in subsidiary books
 yah anivarytah teen prakaar ke khaaton kaa sangrah he - vaastavik, vyaktigat tathaa nammaatr 
 From the above discussion, it is completely clear that the account is not a book of the first entry because no entry is made directly in this introduction
 pravishti sarvapratham sahaayak pustakon main kii jaati he
 It is a book of major importance
 isamen vayavhaar main hone vaale sab saudon se sambandhit khate hote hai
 Although there is no such definite rule, generally one page of a ledger contains only one account
 aisa ashuddhiyon evam puri likhaawat ke bhaddepan ko dur karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 If the number of accounts is very large then it may not be possible to keep all the accounts in one account
 aisi dasha main bahi ko kai vibhaagon athwa parinaamon main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he
 For example, cash book is a subdivision of ledger
 isamen rokad ke saude likhe jate hai
 One way to divide a ledger is to divide it into personal and non-personal or ordinary ledger
 vyaktigat khatabahi ko aage vikray khatabahi ke khate main upavibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly Khatabahi can also be subdivided into actual Khatabhi and nominal Khatabhi
 kabhi-kabhi puunji khaataa or aaharan khaataa rakhane ke liye nijee khatabahi rakhi jaati he
 But no such account is maintained in the company
 yah note kiya janaa chahie ki khatabahi ko upavibhajit karne kii keval akeli uparokt vidhi hi nahin he
 The methods of dividing depend on the circumstances of each
 prayek khatabahi ke armbh main abhisuchak hota he
 Normally, it is descriptive indicative
 abhisuchak kaa ek prishth varnmaala ke ek akshar ke liye niyat kar diya jaataa he or jo naam jis akshar se armbh hote hai ve us akshar ke liye niyat prishth par likh die jate hai
 In the indicator, the number of the page on which the account is opened is written in front of each account
 vyapaar main khatabahi ke kai praaroop milte hai
 The common format consists of columns for date, transaction details, endorsements and funds
 vyapaarik aavashyaktaaon ke anuroop atirikt ghan-raashi stambh jode ja sakate hai
 An alternate form of format, known among banks and some business entities, is one whose entire page of the ledger is divided into six columns
 ye stambh hai - The advantage of this alternative format is that the balance of the account can be withdrawn automatically after each transaction, there is no need to wait till the end of the year to find the balance
 rojnaama evam anya sahaayak pustako se khatabahi main pravishtiyaan karne kii prakriya ko khatauni kaha jaataa he
 It forms the basis for entries given in the Roznamche and other supporting books
 khatauni ke kaary ke liye vishesh kushalta kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti kyonki yah saamaanya prakaar kaa kaary he
 The entries should be noted in the account after writing in the journal
 anya sahaayak pustkon kii khatauni se rojnaama kii khatauni aasaan he
 The amount written in the debit side of the debit side of the journal is deposited in the credit side of the account in the ledger and the amount written in the credit side's money column is deposited in the ledger's credit side
 khatabahi ke vivaran stambh main khaaton ke naam adal-badal kar die jate hai - rojnaama ke us khate kaa naam jisamen ki dhan-raashi debit kii gai he
 The statement of credit side of the second account will be written in the account column
 isi prakaar se iskaa vipareet bhi sahi he
 This can be understood by the following example
 khatabahi main prayek lender kaa ek alag khaataa kholaa jaataa he
 The amount of each purchase will be credited to the respective personal account, usually daily
 is pustak kii dwi-pravishti kul krayon kaa aavadhik yoga ke kray khate main debit karne se purna hogi
 Each debtor has to open a separate account in the account book
 saadharantaya udhaar bikri ko vaiyakti khate main pratidin khataya jaataa he
 The individual account of the customers will be debited from the sale amount
 vikray khaataa udhaar bikri ke masik yoga se credit kiya jayega
 Thus the double-entry of this book will be completed
 khaatabahi main us prayek vyakti, jise maal lautaaya gaya he, ko ‘debit kiya jaataa he or maheene ke ant main vapasiyon ke aavadhik yoga ko khatabahi main kray vaapasi khate main credit kiya jaataa he
 Each customer who returns the goods is credited and at the end of the month the sales-back account of the sum of the sales-return book is debited
 rokad kii sabhi madon ko khatabahi main khatabahi main khataya jaataa he
 All the receipts written in the debit side of the cash book are deposited in the credit of the respective accounts by writing 'from cash', 'from bank', 'from discount'
 rokad bahi ke credit paksh main likhe gayi sabhi bhugtanon ko sambandhit khaaton ke debit main ‘rocked se’, ‘chhot se’, bank se’ likhakar khataya jaataa he
 The sum of the debit side of the debit side of the cash book is written on the debit side of the rebate account in the ledger
 kyonki maden vyaktigat khaaton ke credit paksh main khatai jaati he
 The sum of the rebate column of the credit side of the cash book is written to the credit side of the rebate account in the account due to the item being debited to the individual accounts
 us vyakti, jisase vinamay-vipatr mila he, kaa khaataa vipatr kii dhan-raashi se credit kar diya jaataa he
 The receivable-exchange-bills account is debited in the ledger from the monthly totals of the bills received
 us vyakti, jisko vipatr diya jaataa he, kaa khaataa vipatr kii dhan-raashi se debit kiya he
 The Exchange Bills Account payable in the ledger is credited by the monthly totals of the bills due
 aavadhik interval par khudara rokad bahi ke vaishleshak stambhon dwaara darshaae gaye khudara vyayon ke vishleshan kii general pravishti kii jaati he
 Each nominal account is debited by its respective totals and is credited with the total retail expenses incurred during the retail cash account period
 yah pataa lagane ke liye ki ek vishesh vyakti se kya lenaa he yaa ek vishesh vyakti ko kya dena he, uske vyaktigat khate kaa shesh nikaalnaa aavashyak he
 This process is called closing of accounts
 ek khate kaa shesh nikaalane ke liye uske donon pakshon kaa yoga lagaaya jaataa he
 If both sides are not equal, then the two sides are written on the side lacking the difference to make them equal
 kami vaale paksh main likhane ke liye jo antar is prakaar praapt kiya jaataa he use us khate kaa shesh kehete hai
 If the sum of the debit side is more than the sum of the credit side, the balance is written as “SHTHAL THANDSANDBAM” and written to the credit side
 aisi dasha main us shesh ko debit shesh kaha jaataa he
 At the beginning of the second year, the balance is written to the debit side after writing the account name at the time of opening the account
 isi prakaar se yadi credit paksh kaa yoga debit paksh ke yoga se adhik he to shesh ko shthal insandbam idhakashlikhakar credit paksh main likh diya jaataa he
 This balance is called credit balance
 vaastavik khate vyapaar kii sampattiyon ko darshaate hai
 The balances of these accounts are extracted on the date of the letter to find the amount of the assets of the right to trade
 inkaa shesh bhi usee prakaar nikaala jaataa he
 Just as the balance of individual accounts is drawn
 yah note kiya janaa chahie ki vaastavik khaaton kaa shesh hameshaa debit hi hota he yaa koi shesh nahin hota arthath unka shesh kabhi bhi credit shesh nahin ho saktaa
 Nominal accounts are related to business expenses, losses, income and profits
 inkaa shesh nahin nikaala jaataa he
 In fact, they are closed by transferring them to business account or profit and loss account
 tippanee While taking out the balance of the accounts or closing it, it should be kept in mind that the joint of the two sides should be written in a straight line
 yadi khaaton main keval ek hi pravishti he to jod lagaana anaavashyak he
 The double line drawn below the entry will mean that the entry is its own joint
 isi prakaar yadi ek khate kii donon ore samaan dhan-raashi vaali ek-ek pravisht he to bhi jod lagaana anaavashyak hoga
 Propellant or propeller is a device or machine that is mounted on a vehicle and works to push it forward
 nodakon ke ghurnan ke dwaara vaayu yaa jal ko peeche phenkane main madad milti he jisase yaan par aage kii ore bal lagata he
 The propellant propellants mounted on ships and aircraft push the vehicle forward by throwing water or air backward
 nodak shabd se nimnlikhit kaa taatpary nikal saktaa he: In this way turbine is a naturally developed technology of water wheel
 haalanki, jab tak audyogic kranti nahin hui thi, tab tak aadhunik tarabine kaa vikaas nahin hua tha
 Historically, it was used in big factories in the 19th century
 lekin, jab bijli kii utpatti hui tab se kaarkaanon main jenerator kaa istemaal hone laga
 ab agar tarabine kii karypranali kii baat karen to yah newton ke tisare gati niyam ke adhaar par kaam karti he
 That is, on every action, the opposite reaction occurs
 isi tarah tarabine kaa propeller kaam karata he
 The spindle in the propeller exerts pressure on air or water
 isi dabaav kii vajah se propeller tarabine ko peeche kii ore dhakka martha he, jisase vah chalati he
 Usually the turbine is kept in a place so that whenever the water passes through it, it is driven by the pressure on each blade of the turbine
 hawa yaa pani ke tarabine ke saath ek hi niyam lagu hota he
 The higher the water or air flow, the faster the turbine will run
 443 kilometre yah rajmarg pashchim bengal main dalcola ko kolkata se jodta he

 However, most of his films aimed at a more adult audience were not very successful; Metro, i Spy, and Showtime grossed less than $ 40 million in the domestic market; With a gross of less than $ 13 million, Holy Man performed poorly and The Adventures of Pluto is one of the highest-grossing films in Nash history, reportedly with a budget of $ 110 million while grossing worldwide

 deshon, kshetron yaa vyaktion kii aarthik samruddhi ke vruddhi ko aarthik vikaas kehete hai
 From the point of view of policy making, economic development refers to all the efforts that are aimed at improving the economic condition and standard of living of a people
 vartmaan yug kii sabase mahatvapurn samasya 'aarthik vikaas' kii samasya he
 Without political freedom, political freedom is of no importance
 vikaas or usase jude hue muddon ke is mahatv ke kaaran hi arthshaastra ke kshetra main vikaas-arthshaastra naamak ek alag vishay kaa hi udai ho gaya
 But for the past few years, the existence as an independent subject of development economics is appearing as a question mark
 kai arthshaastri hai jo "vikaas-arthshaastra" naamak alag vishay kii aavashyaktaa se hi inkaar karne lage hai, inamen pramukh hai- slatz, hebralar, baar, little, walters aadi
 a section of economists have started demanding to abolish "development-economics"
 kuch arthshaastriyon ne 'aarthik vikaas', 'aarthik pragati' or dirghakaalin parivartan kii alag-alag paribhaashaayen kii hai
 But Maier and Boldwin have used these three word-groups in the same sense and called different meanings to 'remove the skin of the hair'
 unke anusaar, There is a debate and debate in economics about the meaning and measurement of development
 kintu itani lambii bahes ke baavjood bhi vikaas kaa arth hi spasht nahin ho paa rahaa he
 When an economist wants to express his intention about development, he explains the meaning of development and gives its definition
 kintu kuch samay baad vah swayan hi apni paribhaasha se asantusht dikhaai detaa he
 He feels that he is unable to say what he wanted, he is not able to go where he wanted to go
 yah ek ajeeb sthiti he ki vikaas kaa arth spasht hue bina hi vikaas yojanaayen, vikaas model, vikaas niti evam ranneeti taiyaar ho raheen he or vikaas ke naam par prayek desh main anek prakaar kii gatividhiyaan bhi chal rahi hai
 This was a situation where the name and direction of the place to which a person wants to go is not clear, but still he walks
 aarthik samruddhi kahen yaa aarthik vikaas?- in donon main se koun-si shabdaawalee kaa prayog karen- isko lekar bhi arthshaastri duvidha main hai
 In simple parlance, both these words economic prosperity and economic development have been used in the same sense
 lekin sabase pehle pro
 shumpiter ne 1911 main prakashit "theory of ichnomik devlepment" naamak ek lekh main aarthik samruddhi evam aarthik vikaas kii avadharanaon main antar spasht kiya tha
 Since then, many economists have differentiated these concepts
 pro
 kindolbarger ke anusaar, aarthik samruddhi se taatpary he adhik utpaadan, jabaki aarthik vikaas main donon baaten shaamil hoti hai- adhik utpaadak tathaa takneekee evam sansthagat vyavasthaaon main parivartan
 Thus economic growth is a broader concept than economic prosperity
 takneekee drushti se samruddhi evam vikaas kii dharanaon main antar maanate hue bhi zyaadaatar arthshaastriyon ne vyaavhaarik drushti se samruddhi or vikaas ko ek hi arth main paribhaashit kiya he
 They define development as income and production growth, even after considering development as something ahead of 'growth in income' and 'production growth'
 vikaas ko keval prati vyakti sakal gharelu utpaada main vruddhi ke rup main na maanate hue bhi ve vishwa ke viksit, vikasshil or aviksit deshon ke bich vibhaajan prati vyakti ji
di
pi
 ke aadhaar par hi karte hai
 It is ironic that on the one hand they say that development is not it, but on the other hand, what is not there is development
 vikaas-arthshaastra main vikaas ke arth evam paribhaasha se bhi bada vivaad or bhram vikaas ke maap evam suchakon ko lekar he
 It can also be said that the dispute of the meaning and definition of development has arisen from the dispute of measurement or indicators of development
 prashn yah he ki kya vikaas ko sankhyatmak rup se mapa ja saktaa he? pashchimi arthshaastra ne yah mana he ki vikaas ko sankhyatmak rup se mapa ja saktaa he
 After assuming this, the second question arises as to how development can be measured and by what parameters whether a country has developed or not and how much has happened
 samay-samay par vikaas ko maapne ke liye anek suchakon kaa suzav diya jaataa rahaa he
 We can mainly classify various indicators of development into two parts - economic indicators and non-economic indicators
 kuch arthshaastri jaise kujanets, meyar evam baldwin, mid aadi vaastavik ji

pi
 ko hi vikaas kaa sarvottam suchak maanate hai
 According to him, the real GDP We can measure the rate of growth on the basis of growth rate

 ko vikaas kaa upyogi maapdand hote hue bhi ise samuchit maapdand nahin mana ja saktaa he
 Its main drawbacks are as follows- adhikansh arthshaastri prati vyakti vaastavik ji
di
pi
 main vruddhi ko hi vikaas kaa sarvottam, vyaavhaarik evam suvidhajanak maapdand maanate hai
 Kindleberger, Mayer, Higgins, Harvey Lebenstein, W
A
 Economists like Lewis, Jacob Wainer etc
 are of this opinion
 sanyukt raashtra sangh ne bhi isi maap ko sweekaar kiya he
 GDP per capita
 After accepting the criteria of development, the effect of growth of the population is also considered, because the total GDP
 The GDP per capita is given only in the share of the total population
 Is calculated
 kintu vikaas ke maapdand ke rup main prati vyakti ji

pi
 bhi adhuraa maapdand he or iske bhi kai dosha hai
 Chief among these are- saar rup main, ji
di
pi
 evam prati vyakti ji
di
pi
 ko vikaas ke maapdand rup main sweekaar kiye jane ke kuch dosha hai jo nimnlikhit hai- Some scholars believe that the ultimate goal of development is to increase the standard of living and living of people and the standard of living depends on the amount of goods and services available for consumption
 at: prati vyakti upbhog kaa str aarthik vikaas kaa sarvottam maapdand he
 But this measurement also has its own difficulty
 prayek desh ko bhavishya main adhik utpaadan karne ke liye puunji-sanchay va bachat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or iske liye upbhog ko kam karnaa padataa he
 If a country is increasing its savings and capital formation by reducing its consumption, then assuming the per capita consumption level as the criterion of development, that country's economic development will not be considered
 duusari ore, yadi koi desh vartmaan main apane upbhog str main to kaaphi vruddhi kar letaa he kintu uski bachat va puunji nirmaan kam ho jaataa he, to isse bhavishya main uske kul utpaadan main kami aane kii sambhaavna utpann ho jaaegi
 But according to the criteria of per capita consumption level, economic growth of that country has been done, it will be said
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar aarthik kalyaan hi aarthik vikaas kaa sarvottam maapdand ho saktaa he
 While considering economic welfare, we will not only look at what and how much is being produced, but it will also look at how it is being produced and how it is being distributed
 aarthik kalyaan main yah bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki desh main jin-jin vastuon kaa utpaadan kiya ja rahaa he unka tulanaatmak mahatv kitna he? is prakaar isamen hamen moolyaatmak nirnay lene honge
 Similarly, the social cost of production will also have to be considered
 yadhyapi aarthik kalyaan kaa maapdand vikaas kaa adhik upyukt maapdand he kintu phir bhi abhi tak arthshaastriyon ne iskaa vyavhaar main prayog nahin kiya he
 The reason for this is that they have said that fundamental decisions, fair distribution, social cost etc
 are things which are very difficult to calculate in practice, hence economic welfare has been left as impractical
 vibhinn deshon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kuch arthshaastriyon ne samyojit sakal rashtriya utpaada ko vikaas ke maapdand ke rup main sweekaar karne kaa suzav diya he
 The concept of purchasing power parity is used to adjust national income accounts through this measure
 kintu is maapdand main bhi rashtriya aay ke maap kii sabhi simaaen to hai hi, uske alaava rashtriya aay kaa samaayojan karnaa hi koi saral kaam nahin he, uski apni kathinaaiyaan va simaaen hai
 Apart from the above parameters, some scholars have suggested the use of many more parameters of development
 udhaaharan ke liye, kul jansankhya main nirdhan varg kaa pratishat kam hona aarthik vikaas kaa ek acha maapdand ho saktaa he
 But all these criteria are unilateral
 saamaajik suchakon main manushya kii aadharbhoot aavashyaktaaon ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 The main social indicators include life expectancy, calorie-pan, infant mortality, enrollment in primary classes in schools, housing, nutrition, health and all such other things which are related to basic needs of human beings
 is pranali ko stone evam sears ne diya tha
 In this sequence, Piatt and Round also gave an indicator in the name of social accounting matrix
 kintu is prakaar kii pranali kii sabase badi kami vishwasaneey evam upyogi aankadon kaa na mil paanaa he
 Apart from this, it is also difficult to include all aspects of social development
 is suchak kaa vikaas saamaajik vikaas par sanyukt raashtra ke shodh santhaan dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Initially 73 indicators were tested out of which 16 indicators were selected at the end
 ye suchak hai- It is clear from looking at the above indicators that these too cannot be suitable criteria for development
 vikaas ke is suchak ko 1979 main moris di
 moris ne diya tha
 Under this, it was said to use three indicators - yah suchak bhi adhuraa he
 Because it does not include many social and psychological indicators - like security, justice, human rights etc

 God told me when i ordered you that someone stopped you from prostrating again, i am afraid of him, you created me with fire and you created him from the soil, God ordered me to get down out of rage because you have no power If you stay here, then go out from here, then you are out of here
 You say to the people of the district, then give me the time till the day when all the people of the living stand up again You will be told that you have been given an extension, because if you follow my path, then if i also look at the Adam who is on your straight path, then i will come right over them and from behind them and from their right and their left
 And and you will not find the gratitude of many of them, God has given you a bad situation from here and will agree with those who will say to you, then i will surely fill you all in the world Su o Adam, you and endured in your wife Behsht and where you want to eat But do not go close to that court or else you will harm yourself
 Then Satan got the two of them recovered so that their lining which was nourished due to the uncanny veneer from their eyes started to say that your God only gave them both from the court
 That is why you both refuse to become angels or stay forever and eat in front of both of them, i am sure i will take care of you because of my poor deception It took both of them towards him, whoever tasted the process that their creations were revealed to them and the unconscious leaves began to cover themselves, then their family gave them a voice that why i told you both of this court i did not refuse to pass and did not say that the devil is your unending open mind, both of these people started earning, our parents, we did ourselves harm and if you If we do not forgive and do not have mercy on us, then we will be absolutely in loss
 Get down from all of you unhappily, one of you has an evil and for the time being you have stagnation and life in your life, God told you that you will live life in the ground and you will die in it and from there again Again you will be taken out alive, o Adam's child, we have made a costume for you, which hides your shame and clothes for the zenat and will also abstain

 Held the view was not that faith has Rfikh agreement and that people when a malfunction We found our fathers and grandfathers in that way, and God has given this command that you can clearly say that God has given this command, you should say that God does not give orders for bad things
 Do not know that you say that my family has given justice and every person should pray and pray directly and pray for it, pray for him in the same way
 You have started you in the same way, you will be resurrected the same way and instructed a fariq and a gang went on a rampage
 Those people, except God, have made the devils their backers and despite that they mislead him on the way But o Aulad Adam, during every namaz, go and eat the water and eat and drink and do not spend money, do not ask the friends who spend their money So that the food and hygiene that God has created for his brothers Who has destroyed you, tell yourself that all the Pakistani things are special for those who believe in the life of the world on the Day of Judgment, we hereby make our verses to make wise statements for the wise people and tell us clearly that our God It has prevented all the evil men from sacrificing their lives or sacrificing their lives and crime and violence and that you can make someone who is God There is no plea from him nor Nazim Fermai, and also because he understands that there is a special time for the Bohtan barons and every gang, but when their time comes, they can neither stay a watch behind nor move forward
 When the Prophet among you comes to you and tells us your work, then there will be no fear, nor will those Arjada be for the sake, and those who have defied our rectangles and sat down with them take it Jhnnumi that it always will remain unchanged so that Skhs lie on God's Bohtan Baॅde Or who will be more oppressed than to deny his verses, then there are those people who will continue to receive the written part of them, even when we come to them and take possession of their souls, then you will ask that whom you used to call God except now

 i reach and i care for you and the things that i know from God, you don't know, are you surprised by that? That you have mentioned your family through one of your men so that it scares you and so that you are bitten by the sparrows and so that you may have mercy on them, then we have given them and the people with them i was saved and the rest of the people who had defied our scriptures drowned all of them, all of them were blind people and their brother Hood towards the community Has said to people: o my people do worship God as you no god but Him Otherwise, are you not afraid? Some of the demos of his people who were infidels started saying, We see you in the snow, and we certainly believe you to be a liar
 Hood said, "oh my, there is nothing in me, but i am i am the Messenger of God, i bring you the message of your family and i am your true care
 Do you wonder if The command of your family is with a man in you to scare you and remember that when he made you a caliph after the demise Noah and made a lot of life against you, then remember the blessings of God so that you can get a wish Those people started saying that you have come to us only if you pray for God, and those whom our fathers have come to worship, sit and leave them if you If it is true that you scare us, bring us to us, Hood replied that your You have got a strange and amazing feeling from the side of the family, do you quarrel with me about some of the names that you and your fathers have built, although God has no interest for them, i would like to wait with you, i too with you
 After all, we have saved them and those who were with them from their mercy and we have cut off the root of those who had denied our verses and The people were not even believers and sent their brother Saleh as Rasool towards Samud, so they pray that i do not worship my religion and no one is your lover except you

" Keep it, when God has left me with your poor deeds, even after that, if we return to your faith, then we put a big false boast on ourselves and for us In no way is it fair that we should return to your faith, but yes, if my God wants my God, then our God is surrounded by all things, we have trusted Him alone, Our God, You are the one between us and our people Make the right decision and you are going to make the best decision and some of the people of his community who were infidels started saying that if you have advocated for the UB, then In Yk that you will be in strict losses necessity took Jhljhle those Then why should i regret the infidels and we did not send any prophet to any colony, but made the people living there hard and in trouble, so that those people got angry and then we changed the rest in place of trouble, even that people grew
 And started saying that this kind of trouble and comfort has reached our fathers grandfather, then we arrested them and they were completely oblivious and if the residents of those settlements We would have opened the sky and land on them, if we had agreed and were avoiding them, but if they had lied, then we have arrested them because of their misdeeds, the residents of the settlements are unaware that our surprise comes on them overnight
 When they fall asleep unaware or those settlements are unaware that their wonder is reached in broad daylight, when they play, are these people free from God If you have gone, then the people who are going to suffer losses due to the grief of God are sitting fearless
 They are the heirs of the land after the first land, they do not know that if we wanted, because of their sins, they would have trapped them in their hearts, we have these few colonies on our hearts, whose circumstances we tell you and there is no That their Prophet brought them with promises and illuminations, but these people who had been false before, were going to bring honor to the Gods of their own hearts
 And Alamat retracts and we did not find any kind of akshar out of it and we only found the repulsions out of them
 Then we sent Moses to Pharaoh and his chiefs, so they loved those pleas with love
 Just think about what was the result of the tragedies and Moses said, "I am sure of the blessings of God, i am sure that i am right not to say anything except the truth to God
" i of course you have to take from your Lord Vajea and Roshn Mujijhe If i have come, you should be my friend to Israel, then you will start saying, if you are real and you have come with a chance, then show it to Moses
 He put his stick on it
 Is that he is shining in the eyes of every person, then some of the people of Pharaoh's community said that this is a very good magician, he wants you to come out of the country If you leave it out, now what do you guys recommend about it? Everyone said that Alafaz said that keep him and his brother in prison for a few days and send them to the courtesans to collect all the great magicians and attend the court with you
 The poor sorcerer all came to Pharaoh and said that if we win, we must get a huge reward
 They will be from the congregation and at the time when all are gathered, they say, o Moses Either you) or we Moses said, "you are the one who threw them, then whatever they did, they closed the eyes of the people and frightened the people, and they gave their stick even bigger then what do they see The stick is swallowing them one by one
 Al Qisa Haq Haq is sitting frozen and all his karstani gets mixed up
 Phe Phiroun and all of his side loses in this arena and turns to Zalil and Roussewa and turns to magic i fell in front of Moses and said that we all believed in the family of Jahan, which is the family of Moses and Aaron
 Then he said that you believe in the permission of my permission, it is definitely a pleasure for you people
 It is spread in that city so that you can remove its nostrils from here and out, but you will know about the pleasure of that process very soon

 Even if we bring all the funds for it, but we will not believe in you in any way, then we had storms and birds and gambling and frogs and bloodshed on them, but even then, they keep doing it and those people were guilty
 On the hope of asking for blessings from your God and if you postpone the Azab from us, we will surely send it to you when we reach them for the time that they must reach Azab
 When removed, we would immediately start abusing and then finally we took revenge from them, because Those people used to lie in our rectangles and confided in them, we immersed them in the river and made the heirs of these people who were weak, they inherited the eastern side of the land in which we had conferred and the Israelis became patient
 That is why the righteous promise of your family was fulfilled and all the people of Pharaoh and its people used to build and build high buildings
 We gave and we removed the built-up Israel across the river, then passed through a people who were sitting on the crest of their idols and started saying, a man like Moses is the love of those people
 Gave that you people are gothic people, the faith that these people are doing and what these people are doing
 Do you mean that except God, i should search for your friend, although he Programming the virtue at all dig when we were saved from thee Firaun when he People used to bring you great hardship, your sons were killed and your women and your family in it were your hard test and we promised Moses for thirty nights to give money and we increased it ten times daily
 The promise of his family was fulfilled in forty nights and Moses told his brother Aaron that you are my lover in my demos Stay and treat them and do not follow the way of the murderers and when Moses kept fulfilling our promise and we were honored by him, then Moses requested that God give me a glimpse of you that i will see you
 You can not see me at all, but if you look at that mountain, if you stay in your place, then understand that you will also see me once again when their family on the mountain When he was refreshed, it shattered him and Moses fell unconscious and when he came to his senses Saying God, you are Pak and Pakiza - i have stayed in your barbecue and i believe in your adoration before all, God has told me, i have given you my prophecy on all the people and we have done everything which we have given you Ata's take it and be careful and we had written all kinds of pretexts for Moses in the placards and a statement of everything, so you can make it stronger and stronger
 Command the people to follow the good things in it and very soon i will show you the house of ill-fated people, those who roam undisturbed on the ground, they will be turned away from their rectangles very soon, and what will i do if all the pleasures of the world exist? Even if they see it, they will not bring emaan on them and even if they are able to see the straight path, then they will not go their way and if you see the way of missing, then they will find their way immediately
 Might not these Kjrvi those that took place in this matter have denied Our signs and They would be punished or punished only for the amal that they used to do, and after their departure, the people of Moses made their jewels a calf idol with a sing-like voice that they did not even see So he could talk to them and could not instruct them in any way
 Those people used to torture him and you and when he repented and saw himself as misguided, then he said that if our The wall will not pity us and our paternity will not forgive us, then we will surely be among the losers, and when Moses turned to his demon, he said in anger and anger that you guys did very bad things after me - you How quickly did the people sit at the behest of their family and threw the placards and Aaron's head said to him, "what do i do, my brother, i think i have the right and rather It was good that if you kill me, do not serve the enemies and let me Do not make agreement with the oppressed people then) Musa said, o my God, bless me and my brother and enter us in your mercy and you are the best to be merciless
 There will be a miracle from the side of the family, and in the world of life, we do the same punishment to the people of Bauthan and those who have done bad things and who have done bad things after that
 If i bring Lee and Imaan, then i am afraid of your familyafter that there is a sure kind of clemency and when Moses got angry, he took the placards and in the recipe of Taurait there is instruction and mercy for those who are afraid of their family, and Moses fulfilled our promise to fulfill our promise
 When the men were picked by the Zalzale, then Hazrat Musa approached the Lord, if you wanted me, you would have given me and all of them a lot earlier
 Nd is punishing us in the punishment of fools, it was only your trial that you leave it in the lurch and whomever you wish, you are our master, you forgive our cousin and have mercy on us and you It is better than all those who are saved and you write for the sake of this world and for our good in the end, we tend to look towards you, God has given me the one i want i pass on by and my mercy has been on everything i do that it will soon lead i will continue to write for the people and will give zakat and those who will believe in our words, those who follow the steps of our Bani Ul Ummi Prophet, who are found to be written in their haraaat and gospel, which would command good work
 And prevents them from doing bad things, and hurts the punk and dirty things which are on their neck and the burden which was on their neck and the snare which is on them He removes from them those who bring emaan on him and respect him and help him and defend the noor who has been impregnated with him, then these people will get their heartfelt wishes that you can say that in the people you all have that i am sent by God, for whom the whole sky and land is ruled, except that there is no other person who lives the same, he kills only God and believe in his Rasul Nabi ul Ummi who is good Da and believes in his words and actions of the external action come to you Get instruction and there are some people in the community of Moses who also do the right thing and do justice, and we have made twelve gangs apart from one grandfather of one of Israel's grandfather and when Moses' community If we ask for water from them, then we sent the same to them that you beat your stick on the stone that twelve glasses of water came out of that stone and it was so different that every tribe knew its ghat and we He overshadowed Abraham on the created Israel and the things that were given to you by the mind and salwa Nazil spoil them and they do not spoil ourselves but when they were told to go and stay in that village, endure and If you want to eat from your dry fruits and say Hutma by mouth and while entering the door while prostrating, then we take care of you Twelve gangs separated the children of each of the grandfathers of Israel, and when the people of Moses asked for water from them, we sent the same to them that you beat your stick on the stone that twelve stones of water came out of that stone and it was clear It is different that each tribe has known its own ghat and we have taken the shadow of Abraham on the Israel and built the mind and salwa on those things which you have given to them and they have done something for us Ra does not spoil but spoils himself and when he was told to go and live in that village and eat from his dry fruits, where you can live and say Hutma by mouth and prostrate and enter the door, then we take care of you

 kehane kaa taatpary he prakruti ke bhinn-bhinn parinaamon kaa jahaan pratipaadan ho vahi puraana brahmavaivart kehalaata he
 Although Vishnu's incarnation Krishna is mentioned in many Puranas, but in this Purana this subject is different
 'brahmavaivart puraana' main krishna ko hi 'parabrahm' mana gaya he, jinaki ichha se sristi kaa janm hota he
 The description of Sri Krishna Leela in the 'brahmavaivarta Purana' is quite different from 'bhagavata Purana'
 'bhagwat puraana' kaa varnan saahitiyik or satvik he jabaki 'brahmavaivart puraana' kaa varnan shringaar ras se paripurna he
 In this Purana, the origin of creation is told to Shri Krishna

 There are two hundred and eighteen chapters in these four
 in chaaron khandon se yukt yah puraana atharah hajaar shlokon kaa bataaya gaya he
 There are four sections of this Purana- Brahma section, Prakriti division, Ganapati section and Shri Krishna birth section are as follows- brahm khand main bhagwaan shrikrishna ke charitra kii lilaon kaa varnan he
 The character of God Brahma is described
 saath hi tatva gyaan kaa varnan he
 In this section, Radha's emergence in the semi-narishishwar form of Shri Krishna is shown with his left limb
 prakruti khand main deviyon ke vibhinn charitron kii charchaa ke saath vishesh rup main saraswati ji kii puja kaa vidhaan aadi diya he
 Finally there is a narrative of the origin and character of the goddess
 isamen vibhinn deviyon ke aavirbhaav or unki shaktiyon tathaa charitron kaa sundar vivaran praapt hota he
 This section begins with a description of 'panchdevi Rupa Prakriti'
 ye paanch rup yashadurga, mahalakshmi, saraswati, gayatri or savitri ke hai
 The Ganesh section discusses in detail the birth of Ganesha and the glory of the holy fast, Ganesha's eulogy, Dashakshari Vidya and Durga Kavach

 Before the modern cycle was invented by Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish blacksmith in 1839, it existed but it used to be pushed forward by pushing the ground backwards from the feet
 macmillan ne isamen pahiye ko pairon se chalaa sakane yogya vyavastha kii
 It is believed that in 1817 the Baron van Drevis of Germany designed the bicycle
 yah lakdi kii bani cykil thi tathaa iskaa naam dressiyen rakhaa gaya tha
 At that time the speed of this cycle was 15 km per hour
 iskaa alp prayog 1830 se 1842 ke bich hua tha
 Macmillan then discovered a movable device that he named Velociped, without dragging it with his feet
 par ab aisa mana jane laga he ki isse bahut purv 1763 main hi france ke piyare lalament ne isaki khoj kii thi
 The idea of using bicyclic in European countries had come to the mind of the people only in the late 18th century, but it was first conceived in 1816 by a Parisian artisan
 us yantra ko hobbi horse, arthath kaath kaa ghoda, kehete the
 In 1865, Lalemen, a resident of Paris, invented the wheel with cranks rotating by foot
 is yantra ko velocipid kehete the
 The climber used to get very tired

 After independence in 1947, bicycle traffic was an essential part of the system in the country for the next several decades
 khaastaur par 1960 se lekar 1990 tak bharat main zyaadaatar pariwaron ke paas cycle thi
 It was the most powerful and economical means of personal traffic

 Even today postmen distribute letters by bicycle
 jamaana badla or courier sevaayen zyada bharosemand ban gayi, lekin cycle kii ahmiyat yahaan bhi khatm nahin hui
 a large number of courier distributors also use bicycles
 1990 main desh main udaarikaran kii shuruyaat hui or tej aarthik badlaav kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 The younger generation of the country was more interested in motorcycle riding

 Hero Honda was becoming the new beat of the country
 yah badlaav aane vaale saalon main or tej hua
 Both wheels of change in the country were changed
 iske baavjood bharat main cycle kii ahmiyat khatm nahin hui he
 Perhaps this is the reason why India still has the highest number of bicycles in the world after China
 nabbe ke dashak ke baad se cykilon kii bikri ke aankanon main ahm badlaav aayaa he
 There has been an increase in the total sales of bicycles, but sales have fallen in rural areas
 aasaan aarthik praayojan kii badaulat log motorcycle ko in ilaakon main zyada tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Actually, the role of bicycle before 1990 was replaced by motorcycle in villages and cities
 2002-03 main dopahiyaa gadiyon kii bikri jahaan 48
12 lakh thi, vah 2008-09 main badhkar 74
37 lakh ho gai thi
 This means that in the last financial year, as many bicycles sold in the country, two-wheelers were also sold
 bisikil ke vibhinn bhaag nimnlikhit hai : The most important part of a bicycle is its frame
 frem kii banaavat aisi honi chahie ki usapar laganevaale purjein apana kaam kushaltapurvak kar saken
 The bicycle frame's triangular frame and front and back tongs are made of hollow, round tubes
 phir unhen frem ke konon par uchit prakaar ke braketon main phasaakar jhaal diya jaataa he
 Care is taken in making a triangular frame that the middle lines of its tubes remain in the same plane
 frem main laga aage kaa stearing sira, usapar laganevaale handls kaa danthal or aage ke chimate ke danthal kii madhya rekhaayen ek duusari par sampati honi chahie
 The arms of the two tree tongs should also be symmetrical and parallel to their midline
 chakkon kii madhya rekha chimaton kii madhya rekha par sampati honi chahie, anyathaa bisikil santulit rahakar sidhi nahin chal sakegi
 It is the custom nowadays to put the wheels in the tactile direction of the navel
 sparsheey are, pahie ke ghere par bhraamak bal bhalee prakaar se daal sakate hai
 Each of the two adjacent areches are tangential in a tangent direction from the hub's flage
 peeche ke pahie main 40 or agle main 32 are lagate hai, at: usee ke anusaar uske gheron main chhed banaae jate hai or habon kii prayek flanz main ghere kii aadhi sankhya main chhed banaae jate hai
 While preparing the flywheel, Vyasabhimukh corrects the first eight arrows, then fills the remaining ones in the same sequence
 chitron main hub kii bai taraf kii flanz main hi are lagaakar dikhaae gaye hai, jo kram se ghere par visham sankhyankit chhedon main hi baithe he
 In even numbered holes, the flange of the right side will sit, so their places are shown empty
 taar se bane are sadaiv tanaav kii sthiti main rahane ke kaaran taan kehalaate hai
 While using the wheels, the wheels of the wheels should be examined from time to time, no shaft should be loose and under no stress
 ungali se bajaakar sabko dekha jaae to unamem ek si awaz nikalni chahie, anyathaa pahie tede hokar are tuutane lagenge
 Tightening them can be done by turning the nipples on the circle in the proper direction
 bisikil ke acchhee prakaar kaam kar sakane ke liye uske ball beringon kii taraf dhyaan dete rahanaa aavashyak he
 If there is a slight sound from any bearings, then there is definitely a defect in it
 use kholkar uske donon taraf kii goliyon kii ginati kar, kapade se ponchkar saaf chamakaa lijie
 If a bullet is broken, cracked or worn, replace it, then look at the circular grooves and corners of its bowl
 ve ghise, kate, yaa khurdare na hon
 If bad, replace them as well
 yadi uparyukt koi aib na ho tathaa goliyaan bhi ek hi sankhya main tathaa samaan naap kii hon, to usamen tel kii kami samajni chahie
 There should not be any kind of garbage or mud in any part of the bearings
 yah pichley pahie main lagaai jaati hai, jiske dwaara savaar apni ichha or aavashyaktaanusaar bisikil kii chaal ke anupaat ko badal sake
 Nowadays there is more promotion of three-speed gear hubs
 aisi giar naabhi bhi banaai jaati he ki peeche ko, arthath ulataa, pedal chalaane se brake lag jaataa he
 To change gait, the ratio of gait between the chakra chakra and navel is changed by dragging a chain with fine rings between the navel axis
 ise khinchne se naabhi ke bheetar lage guaron kii sthiti badal jaati he
 The rider does the work of pulling the chain with force by his liver, but the action of returning is done automatically by the segmental position in the navel
 naabhi ke purje kholane ke liye, pehle baayein haath kaa cone kholkar, phir daahine haath kii taraf lagi goliyon kii ring kholani chahie
 By putting it on the rear wheel, the rider can stop moving whenever he wants to, yet the wheel can continue to spin freely
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he, ek to gharshan belan yukt or doosraa ratchet daant yukt
 Each free wheel should have the quality that the inner parts are stuck on the chain of the pedal, and when the pedals are run again, the inner parts work together and do not slide
 saath hi chakra kii banaavat dhul or pani ke liye abhedya honi chahie
 Nowadays there is more prevalence of ratchet tooth free cycle
 iske ghere kii bhitari paridhi par ratchet ke daant kate hai, jinamein yathasthaan lagaae kute atakkar, pedal kii zanjeer ke madhyam se savaar dwaara die hue khinchaav ko pahie kii naabhi par pareshit kar dete hai
 The paddle stops chained as soon as it stops, and the dogs fall back and forth into the ratchet's teeth with the force of the segmental, causing the sound of "cuttings"
 yadi dubaara chalaane par mukt chakra phisalane lage, athwa jam ho jaae, to use thik karne kii pehali tarkeeb yah he ki usamen mitti kaa tel khub bharkar pahie ko khaali ghumaya jaae, jab vah sab tel nikal chuke tab usamen snehan tel de diya jaae
 If the Ab is not far, then the lid of the Chakra should be opened to see if the dogs have been eroded, or their commands have been broken
 phir use bheetar se bilkul saaf kar toote purje yaa goliyaan nai badalakar, dhakkan kii chudiyaan saavdhaanee se sidhi kas deni chahie
 To hold the tire on the wheel circle, it is made of either steel wire, or a hard knot of rubber on both sides of the wheel, which is clamped under the folded edge of the wheel and stuck to the inner rubber tube When the air is filled, the tire gets diluted and sits in place
 bhitari nalee main itani hi daab se hawa bharani chahie jisase tair savaar kaa bojha sah le or pahie kaa gheraa sadak ke kankad pattharon se nahin takaraae, anyathaa nalee ke kuchle jane or tair ke fat jane kaa dar rahegaa
 Overloading the tire reduces the flexibility of the tire to bounce on the bicycle road, but tightly inflating the required amount increases the diameter of the wheel to its limit and less power than the pedals when running on good roads Has to be imposed
 bhitari nalee main hawa bharne ke liye bud ke hawa valb kaa bahudhaa prayog hota he, jisaki banaavat chitra 13
 main spasht dikhaai gai he
 The rubber wall tube should not be torn, crushed and rotten
 balve ke plag ke upree sire par laganevaali topi sadaiv lagi rahani chahie
 The base of the balves should be tightened tightly on the nut circle
 balve kaa plag, rabar ke balve tub sahit bina rukaawat ke pravisht hokar, khaanchon main baith janaa chahie
 Paddle cracks are attached to their axles by cotters only
 bisikil ke girane, athwa durghatana ke kaaran, yadi crack yaa dhuree tedi ho jaaen, to krinkon ko juda karne ke liye, unpar lage cotter ke nat ko kholkar, kater ke chudeedaar sire ko hathode se thonk kar cotter ko nikaal lenaa chahie, lekin dhyaan rahe ki chudiyaan kharaab na ho jaaen
 Cotters should be applied only after applying any iron under the chest of the crank, otherwise the crank will hit the spindle or ball bearings
 kharabi ke kaaran yadi donon crank ek sidh main na hon, to cotter ke chapate bhaag ko retkar, yaa palatakar, samanjit kar dena chahie
 If the crank is loose on its axis, pushing the cotter to a greater depth is also useful
 bahut dinon tak deele cotter se hi bisikil chalaate rahane se cotter or crank kaa chhed, donon hi, cat jate hai tathaa dhuree kaa khaanchaa bhi bighad jaataa he
 So it is better to change the new couture
 bisikil ke girane se akasar pedal pin bhi tedi ho jaati he
 In such a condition, take off the cap of the waring on the outside of the pedal and take out the cone cone and take the tablets in your hand
 phir pedal kii frem ko sarkaakar, bhitaravale vering kii goliyaan bhi samhaalkar le leni chahie, aisa karne par pedal nikal aayega or padalpin hi crank main lagi rah jaaegi
 After inspecting it and straightening it into the moon, the pedal should be tied up as necessary
 yah zanjeer choti choti pattinuma kadiyon, belanon or rivaton dwaara banaai jaati he
 It should be cleaned, greased with oil and mixed with its stretch and kept in good condition
 zanjeer ke rivatiy jodon ke deele hone tathaa belanon ke ghis jane se uski samgr lambaai bad jaaya karti he
 The pitch of the teeth of the pedal tread wheel does not change, so it hurts by descending from the chain wheel
 isaki pahichaan yah he ki patr par chadhi hui zanjeer ke sparshachaap ke bich main, use anguthe or tarjani se pakadakar baahar kii taraf khinchaa jaae
 If the chain is stretched only about an inch, then it is fine and if it is stretched by an inch, it must have slipped and loosened
 at: badal deni chahie
 The function of manual brakes that pressurize the wheels is based on the connection of the levers and poles
 bauden ke brake, ispaat kii lacheelee nalee main lage ek atampidya taar ke khinchaav par aadhaarit hote hai
 The segregation works to free the brakes
 brake, suraksha kaa pradhan upkaran he, at: brake ke danda susamanjit rahane chahie, arthath aise rahane chahie ki ve aron yaa tiron main na ataken
 The poles should be strong and easy to rotate on the joints
 dekhne main achche or purjein saaf suthere bhi rahane chahie

 If any religion will be opposed to the concepts of science, then the young psyche will not believe in it
 vigyaan evam aadhyatm ke vivechy pruthak hai
 Spirituality is ultimate knowledge, soul-god is knowledge related, Ilme is Ilahi, Chinmaya is knowledge of power
 vigyaan loukik jagat kaa gyaan he, bhautik satta kaa gyaan he, padaarth, vastu, rasayan, prakruti kaa vishleshnatmak-vivechanaatmak gyaan he
 There is a general belief that both are antonyms

 To establish the path of harmony between spirituality and science, traditional religion has to be abandoned that this world is the culmination of the will of God
 hamen vigyaan kii is drushti ko sweekaar karnaa hoga ki sristi rachana ke vyapaar main ishwar ke kartrutv kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 In the creation business, you have to accept the laws of nature

 "the sources of the process of the development of the organism can also be found in this mythological belief of religion that" a human being bears a vagina after wandering in eighty-four million lives ", and in this perspective the mythological belief of taking 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu
 Metaphysics can be done

 Science also has to transcend its materialistic boundaries
 vigyaan vishuddh rup se bhautikwaadi rahaa he
 Science has been seen to establish matter and energy at the root of the world
 vigyaan ko aparthiv chinmay satta kaa bhi sansparsh karnaa hoga
 Future science will also have to give up its urge that consciousness arises from the root matter
 darwin ke vikaswad ke is siddhanth ko to sweekaar karnaa sambhav he ki avanat koti ke jeev se unnat koti ke jeev kaa vikaas hua he kintu unka yah siddhanth tarksangat nahin he ki ajeev se jeev kaa vikaas hua
 There is a logical reason for my belief or belief
 jis vastu kaa jaisaa upadan kaaran hota he, vah usee rup main parinat hota he
 The product of conscious cannot be converted into unconscious
 achetan ke upadan chetan main nahin badal sakate
 It has never happened, nor is it happening, nor will it become an organism and it becomes an organism
 padaarth ke roopantaran se smriti evam buddhi ke gunon ko utpann kiya ja saktaa he magar chetana utpann nahin kii ja sakati
 The study of consciousness is a matter of spirituality

 The creature is conscious
 ajeev achetan he
 The nature of an organism is conscious
 ajeev kaa swabhaav jadtv athwa achaitanya he
 He who knows is the soul
 jo nahin jaanata vah anatma he
 Life is with soul
 ajeev main aatma nahin he
 The creature feels happiness and sorrow
 ajeev ko sukh dukh kii anubhuti nahin hoti
 One who knows, is consciousness; One who does not know is unconscious
 smriti evam buddhi tathaa mastishk ke samast vyapaar 'chetana' nahin hai
 The properties of memory and intelligence can be produced by the transformation of matter, but consciousness cannot be generated
 ek drushti ne mana ki param chaitanya se hi jad jagat kii sristi hoti he
 The second view believes that only material matter has power
 bhautik padaarth ke atirikt anya kisi kii satta nahin he
 Like intelligence and mind, consciousness is also a 'bracing of nerves' or 'system of different nerves' which is ultimately the result of molecules and molecular activity
 bhavishyonmukhi drushti se vichaar karne par yah sweekaar karnaa hoga ki donon kii apni apni bhinn sattaein hai
 The transformation of aziv or root substance is possible in energy, memory, artificial intelligence and intelligence, but it is not conscious

 The computer does not have the consciousness that it is, it is working
 computer manushya kii chetana se prerit hokar kaary karata he
 He does not feel happiness and sorrow

 "I am," "I am happy", "I am sad" - the body does not believe in such experiences

 Whoever believes Indian philosophy is captivated by the word Atma

 The soul has the power to know
 aatma ke dwaara jeev ko apane astitv kaa bodh hota he
 The basic source of knowledge is the soul
 aatma amoort tatv he
 That is not the subject of the senses
 indriyaan use jaan nahin paatin
 This proves the limitation of senses
 isse aatma kaa astitv nahin he - yah siddh nahin hota
 Our mystics have discussed the Annamaya, Pranamaya, Manomaya, Vigyanamaya and Anandamaya dictionaries
 samprati isaki vivechna kaa avkaash nahin he
 Our intention is to propose that it is not possible to ignore the Manomaya Kosh at the time of discussion of the relation between religion and philosophy
 ham keval yah kahana chaahate hai ki vigyaan evam aadhyatm ke bich samrasya kaa maarg sthapit karne main manovigyaan kaa adhyayan bhi sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Work is being done on 'cognitive psychology' in psychology
 pehle manovigyaan uttejan-pratikriya vyavhaar ke aadhaar par hi maanviya vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata tha
 Today's psychology is not limited to studying human behavior based on stimuli and reactions
 ab manovigyaan maanviya vyavhaar ko samajhane ke liye pratyakshan, smriti, kalpana, tark, nirnay, anubhav bodh aadi kaa bhi upyog kar rahaa he
 Cognition is the basis of the study of cognitive psychology
 samvedan evam sangyaan main antar he
 Through sensation, the creature senses excitement
 sangyaan shakti ke dwaara manushya samvednon ko naam, rup, gun aadi bhedon se sangathit kar, gyaan praapt karata he
 In yoga practice tradition, detailed description and deliberation of meditation, perception and samadhi is accessible

 This kind of in-depth study can act as a bridge between spirituality and science
 vigyaan ko is aadharna kaa atikaraman karnaa hoga ki bhautik vigyaan ke niyamon se sampoorn vaastaviktaa kii vyakhya sambhav he
 In this direction, the theorem proposed by Godel in 1936 has significance
 unhone siddh kiya ki ganit kii bahut si vaastaviktaaon ko siddh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This incompleteness of mathematics is not due to ignorance
 iskaa kaaran ganit kii aadharbhoot sanrachana he
 The first physicists believed that in physics interpretation, wave and microscopic fractions are opposite ends
 parmaanu ke avishkaar ke baad bhautik-vigyaan kaa ukt siddhanth amaanya ho gaya he
 It is now well known that simultaneous interpretation of both is necessary for the interpretation of atomic action
 parmaanu ke sambandh main yah bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki parmaanu ke anshon ko ganit kii drushti se vishleshit kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not possible to see atomic fractions by any method
 urjaanu kaa sookshm-ansh yugapat ekaadhik sthanon par ho saktaa he athwa ekaadhik margon par gaman kar saktaa he
 When the observation of the basic reality of the nature of the energy of the physical world is so difficult and complex, then how is it possible to transmit the self-element that transcends all the senses with any device
 jisase sabko janaa jaataa he usko bahya-vidhi se kaise janaa ja saktaa he
 New research work is being done in the field of energy physics in science
 inase bhavishya main aatma athwa chetana ke swatantra astitv kaa pramaan siddh hona sambhav he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain is of the opinion that in the light of the latest research in the fields of energy physics etc
, science is moving towards confirming the theory that biological consciousness is only meant to reveal the consciousness of every creature
