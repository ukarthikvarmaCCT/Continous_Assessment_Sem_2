 shookar influenza, jise ech1en1 yaa swine flu bhi kehete hai, vibhinn shookar influenza vishaanuon main se kisi ek ke dwaara failaayaa gaya sankraman he
 The swine influenza virus is any strain of influenza virus that is responsible for endemic pigs
 2009 tak gyaat es
ai
ve upabhedon main influenza si or influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1, ech1en2, ech3en1, ech3en2 or ech2en3 shaamil hai
 This type of influenza also affects humans and birds
 shookar influenza vishaanu kaa duniya bhar ke suaro main paaya janaa aam he
 The transmission of this virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always cause human influenza, often producing only antibodies against it in the blood
 yadi iskaa sancharan, maanav influenza kaa kaaran banataa he, tab ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Individuals who are regularly exposed to pigs are at greater risk of infection with the flu
 yadi ek sankramit suar kaa maance thik se pakaaya jaye to iske seven se sankraman kaa koi khatra nahin hota
 In the mid-20th century, it became possible to identify subtypes of influenza, which led to an accurate diagnosis of its transmission in humans
 tab se aise keval 50 sancharanon kii pushti kii gai he
 These strains of swine influenza rarely transmit from one human to another
 maanav main zunotic shookar influenza ke lakshan aam influenza ke lakshanon ke samaan hi hote hai, jaise thand laganaa, bukhaar, gale main karaash, khaansi, mansapeshiyon main dard, tej sir dard, kamajori or saamaanya bechaini
 Influenza infection in pigs can cause fever, lethargy, sneeze, cough, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite
 kuch maamalon main yah sankraman garbhpaat kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Although death usually occurs in only 1–4% of cases
 yah sankraman boar kaa vajan gata or vikaas ko prabhavit kar saktaa he jo inke palko ke aarthik nuksaan kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 The weight of an infected pig can decrease from 5 to 6 kg over a period of 3 to 4 weeks
 manushyon main shookar influenza kaa mukhya lakshan hai: - In some cases, the transmission of the swine influenza virus is possible from pigs directly to humans, in which case it is called zoonotic swine influenza
 1958 se lekar abhi tak aise sirf 50 maamle hi report huye hai, jiname se bhi sirf 6 vyakti hi mrityu kaa grass bane hai
 Of these six people, one was a pregnant woman, one had leukemia, one was suffering from Hodgkin disease and two were already healthy
 bhale hi yah pratyaksh maamle bahut kam lagen par vaastavik sankraman kii sahi dar isse kahin adhik ho sakati he, kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon main yah saamaanya rog hi prathit hota he or is kaaran ise report hi nahin kiya jaataa
 Two of the three lineage influenza viruses responsible for human influenza can also spread influenza to pigs, of which influenza a is very common but influenza c is rarely found
 abhi tak influenza bi ko siiron main nahin dekha gaya he
 The strains found in humans and pigs within influenza a and influenza c differ, although re-segregation has resulted in large-scale gene transfer across strains whether present in pigs, birds, or human species
 influenza si vishaanu, maanav or siiron donon ko sankramit karata he lekin iskaa sankraman pakshiyon main nahin hota
 In the past too, it has been transmitted between pigs and humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, influenza si ke kaaran japan or california main bacchon ke bich influenza kaa kam prabhavi prakaar failaa tha
 Influenza c has not been able to cause epidemics in humans due to its limited heterogeneous range and lack of genetic diversity
 shookar influenza, influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1,ech1en2,ech3en1,ech3en2, or ech2en3
 ke kaaran hota he
 Among pigs worldwide, the three influenza a virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common
 ech1en1 spanish flu se aayaa, jo 1918 or 1919 ke dauraan faili ek mahamari thi jisase lagbhag 5 karod log maare gaye the
 The virus that came from Spanish flu was present in pigs
 iskaa sanchalan 20 veen sadi ke dauraan manushyon main bhi hua, yadhyapi yah varsh ke us samay hota he jab prativarsh hone vaali mahamariyaan failati hai, jisase 'saamaanya' influenza or shookar influenza main antar kar paanaa kathin he
 However, cases of infection from pigs to humans are rare and 12 cases have been reported in the US since 2005
 yahe == manushyon main shookar influenza yah shookar ke dwaara manushyon main failaa
 The disease spreads more in the cold

 Nandi Nadi astrology is basically more popular and prevalent in South India
 jyotish kii yah ek anuthi style he jisamen taal patr par likhe bhavishya ke dwaara jyotishshastri fal kathan karte hai
 According to Hindu beliefs, the astrological discipline which was born by Lord Shankar's Gana Nandi is known as Nandi Nadi Astrology
 naadee jyotish vidhi se jab koi apana bhavishya jaanane ke liye ke liye jyotishshastri ke paas jate hai
 Then the first man takes the thumb impression of his right hand and the thumb of his left hand from women
 iske baad kuch taadptr prashankarta ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he or prashankarta se naam kaa pehla or antim shabd poocha jaataa he
 Some other questions and the name of the parent or wife are reconciled with the palm paper which is in the name of the questionnaire
 jis bhi taadptr se prashankarta ke jivan kaa milaap hota he use jyotishshastri padhakar prashankarta bhavishya kathan karte hai
 The main feature of pulse astrology is that if the questioner knows his date of birth, birth constellation, war, lagna, he can easily find the palm leaf
 yah vidhi unke liye bhi uttam he jinhen apni janmatithi evam janmasamay kii jaankaree nahin hoti he
 If the questioner also has information about his date of birth and time of birth, then also by this method he can know his future
 is vidhi se prashankarta yah bhi jaan saktaa hai ki uski janmatithi evam samay kya he
 Its main feature, unlike other astrology method, is that other astrology method has twelve bhavas which are followed by pradesh whereas Nandi Nadi astrology method has sixteen bhavas
 nandi naadee jyotish main din or nishchit samay main hone valighatnaon kaa zikr bhi kiya gaya he
 The truth of the Panchag can also be examined by considering the events occurring in the given time
 agar anya jyotish vidhi se praapt faladesh kaa nandi naadee jyotish vidhi se milan karen to bhavishya main aapke saath hone vaali ghatnaon ke vishay main nishchit jaankaree praapt kii ja sakati hai
 Belief has been given the highest importance in pulse astrology
 agar prashankarta ko naadee jyotish par purna vishwaas he tabhi usko is vidhi se bhavishya fal jaananaa chahie
 If the painter also knows about the pain of the planets by this method, then he has to follow the remedies which have been given to the questionnaire as true
 manyataon ke anusaar agar bataaye gayi upaay par avishvaas kar uskaa paalan nahin karte hai to grahon kii pidaa bad sakati he

 Appears
 duusaren shabdon main yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki tivrograhita manushyon evam jaanwaron main honevaali bahya protein ke prati atyadhik badi hui ati prabhavyata kii avasthaa he, jo ek hi bahya protein ke yoga ko dwitiya baar sui dwaara pravisht karaane ke kaaran stabdhta tathaa pradhat or maadak dravyon se utpann lakshanon ke rup main pragat hoti he
 Tewgrahita was first discovered by Challers Robert Reesche in 1883 by testing ginpig, dog rabbit, etc
 tivrograhitajanya ghatana ko anek viyojit avyavon jaise garbhashay tathaa kshudraantra ke kuch bhaagon par pareekshan karke jab dekha gaya tab inamen bhi vishesh prakaar kii pratikriya kaa namakaran shultse del pareekshan ho gaya
 Spatially, this phenomenon is only visible when the outer protein has been inserted for a second time by superficial needle
 iske lakshanon ke antargat sooyee lagane ke sthaan par shoth, drudhikaran tathaa kothyukt parivartan dikhaai dete hai
 This process occurs 48 hours after applying the needle

 isaki dar main vruddhi hoti dikhaai de rahi he
 The word originated from the Greek words ἀνά ana, adversarial and φύλαξις phylaxis, sa सुरक्षा सुरक्षाaka
 tivrograhita kii utpatti ke yadhyapi kai kaaran hai, tathaapi mul kaaran henry ech0 del kaa bataaya mana gaya he
 In 1928, he proved by tests that the main reason for the origin of anaphylaxis is the interaction of antigen produced by external proteins in the cells and tissues of the body of the organism and the antimicrobial antibody produced in the body, resulting in a substance called histamine
 Has a counterpoint to
 yah dekha gaya he ki yadi raktod ke rogapratikaarak pratipind nishchit rup se bhraman karte rahete hai, to pratijan unase milakar nishprabhav ho jaaya karte hai or jab ve koshikaon main sthir ho jate hai to pratijan se milakar histamin kii utpatti karte hai, jiske kaaran tivrograhitajanya pratikriya hoti he

 However, the correlation between blood related disease and anaphylaxis has not been properly known
 phir bhi kuch vidwaan raktod sambandhi beemaari ko upativr prakaar kii tivrograhita hi maanate hai
 Many types of symptoms in anaphylaxis occur within minutes or hours
 yadi iskaa kaaran aisa padaarth he jo sharir main sidhe rakt pravaah main pravesh karata he to iske lakshan ausatan 5 se 30 minuton main hi dikhaai dene lagate hai yadi iskaa kaaran vah bhojan he jo vyakti ne khaaya he to iskaa ausat samay 2 ghante hota he
 The most common organs affected are: the skin, lungs, and respiratory tract, stomach and intestines, heart and blood vessels, and the central nervous system comprising two or more of these systems

 aawaaj main karkashta, nigalane ke saath pidaa yaa kaph utpann ho saktaa he
 a sudden narrowing of the heart's blood vessels can result in contraction due to the release of histamine from several capillaries in the heart

 Individuals who already have heart disease are at a higher risk of the effects of anaphylaxis on the heart
 nimna raktchaap ke kaaran hriday kii gati tej hona bahut saamaanya he, anaphilaxis se peedit 10% vyaktiyon ko nimna raktchaap ke saath hriday dhadkan kii gati main kami ho sakati he

 Individuals who have disorders due to too many mast cells in the tissues or who are enriched with them are in a higher risk area
 vah agent jiske kaaran anaphilaxis hua he us tak pahunch jitani puraani ho jaayegi, nae riection kaa jokhim utana hi kam hota jaataa he
 Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that begins suddenly and affects many systems of the body
 yah daahak karkon or mast koshikaon tathaa baisafills se cytokine ke srav ke kaaran hota he
 Their secretion is especially due to immune system reactions but may be due to the damage of these cells which are not related to the immune system
 anaphilaxis jab pratiraksha pratikriya ke kaaran hota he, immunoglobin e bahari padaarth se sangyojan karata he jo allergic riection armbh karata he
 The combination of ige is associated with receptor fcεri antibody activation on mast cells and basophils
 mast koshikaaye or basophil daahak karkon jaise histamine ke srav karne ke dwaara pratikriya karte hai
 These factors cause contraction in the soft muscles of bronchioli, widen the blood vessels, increase the secretion of fluid from the blood vessels and decrease the function of the heart muscle
 ek pratirakshi tantra bhi hota he jo ige par nirbhar nahin hota he, parantu yah gyaat nahin he ki kya yah manushyon main bhi utpann hota he
 When anaphylaxis is not caused by the immune system response, the cause of the reaction is the agent that directly destroys mast cells and basophils, causing the secretion of histamine and other substances that are often associated with allergic reactions

 Anaphylaxis disease is diagnosed based on clinical facts
 jab kisi allergy paidaa karne vaale tatv ke sampark main aane ke kuch minuton / ghanton ke bheetar nimnlikhit teen sthitiyon main se koi bhi ek hoti he to is baat kii sambhaavna bahut adhik he ki vyakti ko anaphilaxis he: If a person has a toxic reaction with an insect sting or medication, it may be useful to test the blood for tryptase or histamine in identifying anaphylaxis disease
 halanki, agar yah khaadya ke kaaran ho yaa vyakti kaa raktchaap saamaanya ho to ye jaanch bahut adhik upyogi nahin hoti hai or ve anaphilaxis rog kii pahchaan kii sambhaavna ko nakaar nahin saktin
 Anaphylaxis has three major characteristics
 anoflactic aghat tab hota he jab puure sharir ke zyaadaatar hisson main rakt vahikaayen chaudee ho jaati he jis kaaran se raktchaap nimna ho jaataa he jo vyakti ke saamaanya raktchaap se kam-se-kam 30% kam yaa maanak maan se 30% kam hota he
 Baphasic anaphylaxis is identified when its symptoms begin to reappear within 1–72 hours, even if the person is not in new contact with the allergenic elements that caused the first reaction
 kuch adhyayan daawa karte hai ki anaphilaxis ke kul maamalon main 20% maamle bifesic hote hai
 Symptoms usually return within 8 hours
 duusari pratikriya kaa upachaar bhi mul anaphilaxis kii tarah hi hota he
 Pseudo-anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are old names for anaphylaxis that are caused not by an allergic reaction but by direct injury to the mast cells
 world allergy orgenigeshan dwaara upyog kiya jane vaala vartanaam naam “non-immune anaphilaxis” he
 Some people recommend that the old name should no longer be used
 allergy jaanch is baat kaa nirdhaaran karne main sahaayak ho sakati he ki vyakti ko anaphilaxis hone kaa kaaran kya he
 Skin allergy screening is available for certain foods and toxins
 doodh, andey, moongfalee, mewa or machhlee se sambandhit allergy kii pushti ke liye vishisht rog pratikaarakon ke liye kii jane vaali rakt jaanch upyogi ho sakati he
 Skin tests can confirm penicillin allergies, but there is no skin test for other drugs

 There is no skin or blood test for non-immune anaphylaxis
 kabhi-kabhi asthma, oxigen kii kami se murchhit hone ke kaaran or aakasmik bhay se anaphilaxis ko alag se pahchaan paanaa kathin ho jaataa he
 People with asthma usually do not have itching or stomach or intestinal symptoms
 jab koi vyakti murchhit hota he to twachaa pili pad jaati he lekin, usamen dadore nahin hote hai

 duusari sthitiyaan jinamein aise samaan lakshan ho sakate hai unamem, kharaab machhlee se hone vaali bhojan kii vishaaktata or kuch parjiviyon se hone vaale sankraman shaamil hai
 Avoiding causes that have caused a reaction in the past is the recommended method of prevention of anaphylaxis
 jab aisa sambhav na ho to, aise upachaar bhi hai jinase sharir kaa kisi allergy karne vaale gyaat tatv ke prati pratikriya karnaa band kiya ja saktaa he
 Treatment of the immune system by the Hymenoptera toxins is effective for allergies resulting from bees, wasps, goats, yellowjackets, and fire ants, leading to anesthesia in 80–90% of adults and 98% of children

 Anaphylaxis is a type of medical emergency that may require life-saving measures such as respiratory tract management, supplemental oxygen, large amounts of intravenous fluid, and intensive monitoring
 ipinefrine upachaar kaa ek vikalp he
 Antihistamines and steroids are often used in addition to epinephrine
 jab vyakti saamaanya sthiti main aa jaaen to yah sunishchit karne ke liye aspataal main 2 se 24 ghante tak unki nigaraanee kii jaani chahie ki lakshanon kii punrariti na ho kyonki, agar vyakti ko bifesic anaphilaxis ho to aisa phir se ho saktaa he
 Epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis
 iskaa upyog na karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 It is recommended that epinephrine fluid be injected into the middle forebrain thigh as soon as a suspected condition of anaphylaxis is identified
 yadi vyakti upachaar ke prati behatar pratikriya na de to is injection ko prayek 5 se 15 minute main duharaaya jaae jaataa he
 a second dose is required in 16 to 35% of cases

 Intravenous injections are preferred over injections under the skin, in which the drug can be absorbed at a much slower rate

 Epinephrine is not effective on people who take B-blocker
 is sthiti main, agar ipinefrine prabhavi nahin ho to nason main glucagon diya ja saktaa he
 Glucagon has a function that does not involve β-receptors
 agar aavashyak ho to tanu-taral kaa upyog karke ipinefrine ko nason main bhi diya ja saktaa he
 However, intravenous epinephrine has been linked to irregular heart beats and heart attacks

 Antihistamines are commonly used in addition to epinephrine
 saiddhanthik tarkon par inako prabhavi mana gaya tha lekin is baat ke bahut hi kam sakshya hai ki anaphilaxis ke upachaar main antihistamine vastav main prabhavi he
 The 2007 Cochrane Review found no good quality studies that could be used to recommend it
 shwasan-maarg main taral nirmaan yaa anthan par antihistamine kaa koi bhi prabhaav nahin dekha gaya he
 If the person has anaphylaxis at the present time, there is little chance of any difference from corticosteroids

 methilin blue kaa upyog aise vyaktiyon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo duusare upayon par pratikriya nahin karte hai kyonki yah komal nason ko shithil kar saktaa he
 Those who are at risk of anaphylaxis are advised to follow an "allergic action plan"
 bacchon kii allergy kii samasya ke bare main, unke mata-pita ko isaki jaankaree skool ko deni chaiye or yah bhi bataanaa chaiye ki anoclitic apaat sthiti main kya kiya janaa chahie
 Action plans typically include advice on the use of epinephrine auto-injectors, advice on wearing a bracelet with medical alerts, and avoiding motivators that cause such conditions

 In contrast, John Podhoretz of the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, blasted Harvey Milk's portrayal, stating, "A smart, aggressive, purposeful attacker and press-savvy worker has been used as a teddy bear

 According to screenwriter and journalist Richard David Boyle, who called himself Milk's former political duo, the film made a credible attempt to revive the era
 unhone yah bhi likhaa ki pen ne milk kii muskaan, maanavtaa tathaa samalangikta ko lekar uske parihaas kii samaj ko kaid kar liya

 ] The carbon dioxide from the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the ph
 Carbon dioxide will start to carbonate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made
 This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete
 If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide of the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete
 When designing a concrete structure, it is normal to state the concrete cover for the rebar 
 The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes
 If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur
 One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the surface with phenolphthalein
 This will turn when in contact with alkaline cement, making it possible to see the depth of carbonatation
 An existing hole is no good because the exposed surface will already be carbonated ---> ] This phenomenon has been popularly referred to as "concrete cancer"

 Gaugamela was not far from Babylon, just 32 miles west of Arabella near Tigris
 vahaan greek or irani senaayen shakti ke antim nirnay ke liye aamane-saamne khadi hui
 The battle of Gaugamela is one of the decisive wars of the world
 misr aadi jeetne ke baad jab sikandar gaugamela ke maidan main daara kii padaav daale padi sena se lagbhag teen mile kii duuri par pahunchaa shaam kaa jhutputa ho chukaa tha
 Parmenio suggested to Alexander that the Iranians be attacked in the dark of the night, because in the daylight, seeing the number of Iranian forces counted, it is very likely that our army would suffer
 sinkadar ne uttar main usase kaha ki vah jeet churaayaa nahin karata, ladakar use sambhav karata he
 It is possible, as some historians have said, that the reason Alexander did not attack at night was in fact a technique of war which he could not use in the darkness of night
 sikandar ne aas paas ke ilaakon kaa kuch hi ghanton main kuch ghudsavaaron ke saath daura kar apni sena kaa vyuh banaaya
 Three divisions of horsemen of right and left arm phalanx were deposited

 And if it is not needed, they can turn around and help the army
 daahine paksh ke ghudsavaaron ke saamne usne dhanurdharon or malldhariyon ko irani rathon ke saamne khadaa kiya
 According to Greek historians, Alexander's army consisted of 7 thousand cavalry and 40 thousand on foot, while the Iranian army was five times that number
 sikandar ne mauka dekhakar swayan hamalaa kiya
 He broke on the left side of the Iranians in such a way that Dara had to leave the level and move to the lower land
 daara ne jab dekha ki unchi nichi jameen par uske rath bekaar ho jaayenge tab usne baayein baaju ke ghudsavaaron ko sikandar ke daahine baaju par ghumkar hamalaa karne or use roak dene kaa hukum diya
 The cavalry on both sides sparked off
 ab daara ne rathon ko badhaayaa par ve kabhi sahi upyog main nahin laae ja sake or greek padalon ke tiron ke irani rathi shikaar hone lage
 Just then Alexander turned around and broke through the ground left by the Iranian cavalry with four divisions on the left side of the Iranians and advanced towards Darya himself
 yah hamalaa itane jor kaa hua ki daara ke paanv ukhd gaye or vah maidan chhod bhaaga
 Meanwhile, when the Iranian cavalry on the right side of Alexander saw the Macedonians attacking them from behind, they also escaped, although they suffered a lot of casualties by the enemy
 sikandar kii sena ke bich uske hamalon se jo daraar ban gai thi, iraniyon or bharatiyon ne usee kii raah sahasaa ghuskar greekon ke saamaan bhare tambuon par hamalaa kiya
 At that point, the horsemen on the right side of Dara roamed Alexander's left arm and attacked the sides of the Parmeni
 parmeniyon ne buree tarah ghir jane par sikandar ko apni bhayanak sthiti kii khabar di
 Alexander was then following the broken Iranian arm on the left
 vah ekaek apane ghudsavaaron ko liye lautaa or iraniyon ke daahine baaju par tutaa
 The Iranian cavalry now returned to flee, but when the path behind them stopped like this, then they started fighting with the enemy in front
 na unhone aap sharan maangi na shatru ko sharan di
 Alexander crushed them and an Iranian cavalryman was killed
 arbela tak sikandar kii sena daara kaa peechha karti rahi par use pakad na pai
 Dara escapes and takes refuge in Bakhtri
 arian likhata he ki teen lakh irani maare gaye jab ki sikandar ke kul ek hajaar ghudsavaar maare gaye
 It is clear that this data cannot be trusted
 issus ke yuddh ke baad yah doosraa yuddh tha jisamen iran ko haarana padaa tha or is yuddh ke baad irani samrajya took took ho gaya
 The final center of the Iranians was again established in the Valley of Vanxunad, but Alexander soon broke his last front where the independent Greek monarchy was established after Alexander's death

 Now Persia also came under the authority of Alexander
