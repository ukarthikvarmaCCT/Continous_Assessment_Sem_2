 mataji kaa gaanv tha modpura 
 When some saint-mahatma came here, you and sakhi sang hymns
 ek baar kii baat he ki aapke yahan sant shri jiyaaraamji maharaj padhaare 
 Sakhis asked you to sing Bhajan
 aapane gaaya nahin
 Then someone told Maharaj that she was not singing bhajan
 kisi ne kaha ki ye gaave kaise ! inke to lajka chalaa hua he 
 Then Shri Jiyaram Ji Maharaj said that Ramji will give more
 aap to bhajan gaao
 Then you sang hymns
 bhagawatkrupa se jab aapke lajka hua to laakar jiyaaraamji maharaj ko saunp diya
 The Maharaj said that you keep this child
 abaki baar balak hove tab de dena
 Then Mataji kept that child with him
 uske baad jiyaaraamji maharaj param dham padhaar gayi 
 Then after two years, when the second child was born to Mataji and he became four years old, then Mataji gave it to the saints after Jiyaramji Maharaj, made him a monk
 santon ne inako apana shishy bana liya
 The birth name of the child was Sukhdev
 phir inkaa naam hua - shraddhey swamiji shriramsukhadasji maharaj

 You had a soft gentle nature
 aapke hriday main hameshaa parahit basaa rahata tha jo dusron ko bhi dikhaayi detaa tha
 You always used to work by filtering water
 chane hue jal ko bhi chaar yaa chah ghanton ke baad waapas chaante the; kyonki chaturmaas main chaar ghanton ke baad or anya samay main chah ghanton ke baad main jeev paidaa ho jate hai
 Organisms in water are very small, not visible
 isaliye aap gadhe kapane ko dabl karke jal ko chaante the or saavdhaanee purvak jeevanun karke un jeevon ko jal main chhonte the
 In this way you used the filtered water
 khan, paan, shouch, snaan aadi sab main aap jal chaanakar hi kaam main lete the
 Used to have the least need for their subsistence

 You did not make disciples or accept discipleship
 aap na to kisi se charan chuaate the or na kisi ko charan chune dete the
 While walking on the earth, where your feet used to stay, they did not even allow you to take steps
 kabhi koi stri bhul se bhi charan chhu leti to aap bhojan karnaa chhodh dete the

 You were fiercely opposed to getting an abortion
 jis ghar main ek stri ne bhi garbhpaat karvaa liya ho, to aap us ghar kaa ann nahin lete the or jal bhi nahin lete the
 In the scriptures, abortion is also said to be double the magnitude of bravery
 aap parivaar- niyojan, dahej- pratha or vidhwaa- vivaah aadi kaa virodh karte the
 Before marriage, they considered marriage of bride and groom a sin and prohibited it

 aap satsang ko bahut adhik mahatva dete the
 As if satsang was your life
 aap bataate the ki satsang se jitna laabh hota he utana ekaant main rahakar saadhan karne se bhi nahin hota
 For one year, there is no benefit from being in solitude even by doing means, that benefit is made by one-time satsang
 satsang kare or saadhan kare
 Perform means and satsang
 is prakaar karne se bahut bana laabh hota he
 Satsang is the mother of all
 satsang se jitna laabh hota he, us laabh ko koi kah nahin saktaa
 Everywhere you sat there was regular satsang
 praatah paanch baje vaali satsang to yatra main bhi chalati rahati thi
 Sometimes, because of the journey, when the time of the prayer satsang was going on in the morning and the prayer at five o'clock in the morning, prayer, Gita recitation and satsang were done in the village itself
 din main bhi kai baar satsang hota rahata tha
 You did not like a free day without satsang
 is prakaar bahut badhiya satsang chalata rahaa

 Failure by an organism to recognize its own parts as its own is called autoimmunity or autoimmunity, which results in an immune response to its own cells and tissues
 aisi padbhramit pratirakshi pratikriya ke kaadan hone vaale kisi bhi rog ko swapratirakshi rog kehete hai
 Autoimmunity is often caused by a lack of development of lifespan in the target body and thus the immune response acts against its own cells and tissues
 Notable examples include celiac disease, diabetes type 1), systemic lupus erythematosus), Jögren's syndrome, churg-strauss's pathology, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Grave's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and gouty arthritis)
 See, list of autoimmune diseases
 yah galatfahami nai nahin he ki vyakti kaa pratirakshak tantra apni swayan kii pratijanon ko pahchaanane main sampurna rup se aksham hota he
 In the early twentieth century Paul Ehrlich introduced the theory of horror autotoxicus, according to which the 'normal' body does not initiate an immune response against its own tissues
 is tarah kisi bhi swapratirakshi pratikriya ko asaamaanya mana jaataa tha or maanav rog se sambandhit samajha jaataa tha
 It is now accepted that autoimmune responses are an inexhaustible part of vertebrate immune systems, which are usually prevented by the action of immune tolerance to auto-antigens from causing disease
 swapratiraksha ko kabhi bhinn-pratirakshakta nahin samajhnaa chaiye
 While high levels of autoimmunity are unhealthy, low levels of this can actually be beneficial
 sarvapratham, kam-stareey swapratiraksha sidi8+ tii koshikaon dwaara navtpadit koshikaon kii pahchaan karne main sahaayta karti he or is tarah cancer kii ghatnaon ko kam karti he
 Second, autoimmunity may have a role in allowing a rapid immune response in early stages of infection, at which time the achievement of foreign antigens limits the response
 Stephanova and others, in their study, injected mice with a per-mhc class II antibody expressing a single type of MHC class II molecule to temporarily inhibit CD4 + t cell – MHC interaction
 a decrease in the antigen pigeon's response to the cytochrome c peptide was observed in naive CD4 + t cells derived from these mice at 36 hours after giving per-mhc, which was determined by ZAP-70 phosphorylation, proliferation, and production of interleukin-2
 is tarah steffanova or anya videshi pratijanon kii anupasthiti main sidi4+ tii koshikaon kii pratikriyaatmakataa banaae rakhata he
 This idea of self-defense is theoretically a game of fighting
 sher ke bacchon or swatahemechasi ) ke ladaai ke khel se halki si kharonchen yaa chot ke nishaan ho sakate hai, lekin lambey arse main yah phydemand sabit hota he, kyonki yah sher ke bachche ko bhavishya main acchhee tarah se ladane ke liye taiyaar karata he
 The pioneering work done by Noyle Rose and Witebski in New York and Royte and Doniak at the University College London provide clear evidence that at least the extent of antibody-producing b lymphocytes is associated with lack of immune tolerance, as well as vascular and thyroid poisoning , Which is the ability of a person to reject the 'self' in response to 'non-self'
 is tut-foot ke kaaran pratirakshi tantra dwaara swanirnaayakon ke viruddh ek prabhaavshaalee or vishisht pratirakshi pratikriya prarambh hoti he
 The exact origin of immunological tolerance is not yet known, but several theories have been presented since the mid-twentieth century to describe its origin
 pratirakshivaigyanikon kaa dhyaan teen pariklpanaaon ne vyapak rup se khinchaa he: Apart from these, in-depth study of two other theories is going on: sahishnutaa ko, uparlikhit jaanch kii vidhiyon ke kendriya lasikabh avyavon yaa paridhik lasikabh avyavon main kaary karne yaa na karne ke aadhaar par ‘kendriya’ or ‘paridhik’ sahishnutaaon main vibhajit bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 It should be emphasized that these theories are not mutually exclusive, and there are increasingly indications that all these processes may actively participate in vertebrate immune tolerance
 svaichhik maanav swapratirakshakta main sahishnutaa kaa lop ho janaa ek ulajhanbhara vishesh gun he, jo lagbhag puri tarah se bi lasikakoshikaon dwaara utpann swapratipind pratikriyaaon tak hi simit hota he
 The omission of tolerance in t cells is extremely difficult to demonstrate and wherever evidence of abnormal t cell responses is available, it is generally not against antigens identified by autoantibodies
 is tarah, gathiyaroop vaat main aijiji epasi ke prati swapratipind paae jate hai, lekin usase sambandhit tii koshika pratikriya hoti prathit nahin hoti
 pranalik lupas main diene ke prati swapratipind hote hai, jo tii koshika pratikriya utpann nahin kar sakate or tii koshikaon kii pratikriyaaon kaa simit saboot newcleoprotein pratijanon ko doshi paata he
 In celiac disease the tissues are autoantibodies to transglutaminase, but the t cell response is to the foreign antigen gliadin
 is asamanta ke kaaran yah vichaar aayaa he ki maanav swapratirakshi rog adhikansh maamalon main bi koshika sahishnutaa ke lop hone par aadhaarit he, jo videshi pratijanon ke viruddh saamaanya tii koshika pratikriyaaon kaa prayog vividh prakaar ke pathbhrasht tareekon se karte hai
 Some people have genetically hypersensitivity to autoimmune diseases
 yah atisamvedansheeltaa kai jeenon or anya jokham karkon se sambandh rakhti he
 Autoimmune diseases do not always develop in genetically sensitive people
 kai swapratirakshi rogon main jeenon ke teen mukhya set hone kaa andeh he
 These genes are related to: pehle do, jo pratijanon kii pahchaan main bhaag lete hai, sahaj rup se parivartansheel or punarsangyojan ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 These changes provide the immune system with the ability to react to a wide variety of aggressors, but can also produce lymphocytes with the ability to self-react

 The sex of any person also has some role in the development of autoimmunity, according to which most autoimmune diseases are classified as sex-related diseases
 swapratirakshi rogon se grast 23
5 million se adhik amarikiyon kaa 75 pratishat striyaan hai, haalanki yah kam logon ko pataa he ki lakhon purush bhi in rogon se grast hai
 According to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, autoimmune diseases in men are more acute
 aise kuch swapratirakshi rogon, jinke purushon main hone kii striyon ke baraabar yaa adhik sambhaavna hoti he, main shaamil hai –achaltakaarak kasherukashoth, prakaar 1 madhumeh, vegener kii grenulometosis, kron kaa rog or apras
 The reasons for gender's role in autoimmunity are unclear
 striyon main saamanyatya pratirakshi tantron ke protsaahit hone par purushon kii apeksha adhik badi shothajanak pratikriyaayein utpann hoti prathit hoti hai
 Indications of sex steroids are indicated in many autoimmune diseases with fluctuations in hormone changes, such as during pregnancy, menstrual cycle, or using oral contraceptives
 The history of conception also seems to leave an ever greater risk of autoimmune disease
 yah suzav diya gaya he ki garbhavastha main maataaon or unke bacchon ke bich jaraa sa bhi koshikaon kaa vinimay swapratirakshakta utpann kar saktaa he
 This leads to gender balance in the direction of the female
 ek anya siddhant ke anusaar maadaa ko swapratirakshakta se grast hone kii adhik sambhaavna ek asantulit eks chromosome kii niskriyata ke kaaran hoti he
 The skewed theory of X-inactivity presented by Princeton University's Jeff Stewart has recently been confirmed experimentally in scleroderma and autoimmune thyroiditis
 anya jatil eks-sambandhit jananik samvedansheeltaa prakriyaayein prastut kii gai hai or adhyayanadhin hai
 An interesting inverse relationship exists between infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases
 jin kshetron main anek sankramak rog sthanik hote hai, vahaan swapratirakshi rog kaaphi kam hote hai
 To some extent the reverse also seems to be true
 shubhratha pariklpana main in sambandhon ko rogaanuon dwaara pratirakshakta ko parivartit karne kii yudhnitiyon se joda gaya he
 Although this idea has been termed as false and ineffective, some studies have found the activity of autoimmune diseases with parasitic infections to be low
 prakhyat prakriya ke anusaar paraseete apni raksha karne ke liye mejabaan kii pratirakshi pratikriya ko kam kar detaa he
 By this, the host suffering from autoimmune disease can be fortunate
 paraseete pratirakshi pratikriya ke parivartan ke vivaran abhi tak gyaat nahin hai, lekin inamen shothavirohi karkon kaa srav yaa mejabaan ke pratirakshi sanketan shaamil ho sakate hai
 a contradictory review has observed a powerful association of certain microorganisms with autoimmune diseases
 udhaaharan ke liye, clebsiyela nimoniye or kakssekivirus bi kaa shaktishaalee sambandh kramshah achaltakaarak kasherukashoth or madhumeh prakaar 1 ke saath paaya gaya he
 This is explained by the tendency of infectious bacteria to produce anti-antigens that have the ability to cause multicellular activation of B-lymphocytes and to produce large amounts of antibodies of different characteristics, some of which may be self-reactive
 Huh 
 kuch rasaynic kaarak or aushadhiyaan bhi swapratirakshi rogon, yaa swapratirakshi rogon ke samaan dikhne vaale rogon kii utpatti se sambandhit ho sakati hai
 The most notable of these is the drug-induced lupus erythematosus
 Generally, the patient's symptoms are reduced by stopping the aggressive drug
 dhumrapaan ab gathiyaroop sandhishoth kii ghatana or tivrata ke mukhya jokham kaarak ke rup main sthapit ho chukaa he
 This may be related to abnormal citrullination of proteins, as the effects of smoking have been associated with the presence of antibodies to citrullinated peptides
 swapratirakshi rogon ke rogajananvigyaan main, jananik samvedansheeltaa or paryaavarniya parivartan kii prishthbhumi main kai prakriyaaon ke kaary karne kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 Writing about each of these processes is beyond the scope of this article, but some important procedures are summarized here: visheshgy pratirakshaniamak koshika prakaaron, jaise niamak tii koshikaon, enketi koshikaon, gammadelta tii koshikaon kii swapratirakshi rog main bhoomikaayen adhyayanadhin hai
 Autoimmune diseases can be broadly divided into systemic and organ-specific or endemic autoimmune disorders based on the main clinically-pathogenic special properties of each disease
 parmparik "avyav vishisht" or "gaiyr-avyav vishisht" vargeekaran yojana kaa prayog karke, anek rogon ko swapratirakshi rog chhatrachhaaya ke adheen ekatrit kar diya gaya he
 However, in many chronic inflammatory human disorders, a clear correlation between b and t cell-driven immunogenicity is not found
 It has been well established in the last decade that tissue "self-inflammation" does not necessarily depend on abnormal t and b cell responses
 isse is baat kaa prastaav haal main saamne aayaa he ki swapratirakshakta ke varna-pat ko pratirakshakta rog continuam ke saath dekha janaa chaiye, jisamen adarsh swapratirakshi rog ek sire par or aantarik pratirakshi tantra dwaara sanchalit rog duusare sire par hote hai
 In this scheme, the full spectrum of autoimmunity can be included
 is nai yojana kaa prayog karke kai aam maanav swapratirakshi rogon main kaaphi aantarik pratiraksha dwaara madhyasth kii gai pratiraksharogajanyata dekhi ja sakati he
 This new classification scheme can be used in understanding disease processes and developing treatments
 
 Diagnosis of autoimmune disorders depends on accurate history and physical examination of the patient, and a high indicator of suspicion against the background of certain abnormalities in routine laboratory tests
 kai pranalik vikaron main, vishisht swapratipindon ko pahchaanane vaale sirovaigyanik pareekshanon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Endemic disorders can best be diagnosed by immunofluorescence of biopsy specimens
 swapratipindon kaa prayog kai swapratirakshi rogon ke nidaan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The levels of autoantibodies are measured to determine the development of the disease
 swapratirakshi rog ke upachaar parmparik rup se pratirakshashamak, shothavirohi, yaa santvnaatmak rahe hai
 Non-immune therapies, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or hormone displacement in type 1 diabetes, treat the outcome of an autoaggressive reaction, so these are comforting treatments

 Steroid or NSAID treatment limits the inflammatory symptoms of many diseases
 iviaiji kaa prayog siaidipi or jibies ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Specific immunosuppressive therapies such as anti-tnf alpha, rituximab, a b cell depleting factor, IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab, and the anti-inflammatory inhibitor abetacept have been shown to be useful for the treatment of RA
 inamen se kuch pratirakshiupachaaron kaa sambandh dushprabhavon ke bade hue jokham ke saath ho saktaa he, jaise sankraman kii sambhaavna
 Helminthic treatment is an experimental method in which specific parasitic bowel nematodes are given to the patient

 It is unknown where the name Kilimanjaro came from, but several theories exist
 europea khojakartaaon ne 1860 tak is naam ko apana liya tha or bataaya ki yah iskaa swahili naam tha, or kilimanjaro ko do bhaagon main khandit kiya jaataa he, ek he kilima or doosraa jaaro jiskaa mul, siddhanton ke anusaar badalata rahata he - kuch logon ke anusaar yah pracheen swahili shabd he jiskaa arth safed yaa chamak he, yaa gaiyr-swahili mul ke anusaar yah kichaaga bhashaa se aayaa he, shabd jaaro kaa arth he "kaaravaan"

 The name may be part of a local laugh-out joke, which refers to the "small hill of Jaro", the largest mountain in the African continent, as it is a nearby town and the guides point out that it is the Jaro people hill
 ek alag drushtikon ke tahat yah mana jaataa he ki yah kichaaga kilmnaare yaa kiltjaao se aayaa he jiskaa arth he "jo pakshiyon / tendue / kaaravaan ko parajeet karata he"

 In the 1880s, the mountain, which according to the German spelling Swahili name components was then kilima-ndscharo, became a part of German East Africa when Carl Peters persuaded local heads to sign treaties
 The Kibo peak was named "kaiser-wilhelm-spitz" by Hans Mayer in 1889, when the summit first climbed on 5 October 1889
 is naam kaa prayog 1918 tak kiya gaya, jab pratham vishwa yuddh ke baad german upniveshon ko british samrajya ko de diya gaya
 When the British-administered Tanganyika gained its independence in 1961, the peak was named "uhuru Shikhar", which in Swahili means "independence Shikhar"

 Many other mountains also have this prefix, such as Kilima Bogo which is located just north of Nairobi in Kenya

 The name Kibo in Kichaga means "spotted" which refers to rocks seen in icy plains
 kilimanjaro parvat africa kaa sabase ooncha parvat he or saat shikharon main chauthaa sabase ooncha he
 It is the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, with a Uhuru peak of 5,895 m॰ AMSL

 haalanki yah niskriy he, kilimanjaro main dhoomrachhidr hai jo kibo ke mukhya shikhar par vivar main gas utsarjit karte hai
 Scientists concluded in 2003 that the molten magma is just 400 m॰ below the summit's cavity

 Rongai is the easiest camping route and Marangue is also relatively easy, but accommodation takes place in slums

 Climate adaptation is necessary, and even after this, the most experienced climbers suffer from altitude sickness to some extent
 kilimanjaro shikhar itnaa ooncha he ki us oonchai par ucch tungta phuffusiya shof, yaa ucch tungta pramastishk shof ghatit ho saktaa he
 All climbers experience considerable discomfort, usually shortness of breath, hypothermia and headaches, and although most young, healthy people reach the Uhuru summit, most of the climbing people stop at low altitudes
 ucch oonchai par chadhaai karne vaale klbon ne, parvat par bitaye jane vaale prayek din ke liye shulk vasuul kiye jane par tanzania ke adhikariyon kii aalochana kii he
 This would encourage climbers to climb faster to save time and money, while proper climate-adaptation demands that delays are adopted to climb any higher

 This is, however, not the case
 kai vyaktiyon ko apane prayaas ke dauraan mahatvapurn dhyaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or kai ko to majabuuran apni chadhaai ko tyaagna padataa he
 An investigation into the case has concluded that tourists visiting Tanzania are often encouraged to join climbing groups without explaining how important physical fitness is to it, although many content vendors and tour operators Show off the high success rate of reaching the summit

 Kilimanjaro is often underestimated because it is not a technical climb
 haalanki, kai parvatarohi kilimanjaro ko shaareerik rup se bahut hi kathin chadhaai maanate hai
 Some estimate that more people have lost their lives while climbing Kilimanjaro than Mount Everest, while relatively few climbers have attempted to climb Everest
 Four climbers died within a single week in August 2007 and this incident further proved that climbing should not be taken carelessly
 Many people die on the mountain each year

 sookshirthshaastra main, maang kaa kanoon kahata he ki, "baaki sabhi pahaluon ko baraabar rakhte hue, kisi vastu kii keemton kaa girnaa : uski maang ko badha detaa he ; tathaa kisi vastu kii keemton kaa uthaanaa :uski maang ko gira detaa he
 "in other words, the law of demand describes an inverse relationship between price and quantity that is for a commodity
 vastu kaa daam or upabhokta kii aay kii keemton ko sthai mana jaataa he
 However, there are some possible exceptions to the law of demand, such as Giffen items and Weblane items
 maang kaa kaanoon ganitiya abhivyakti ke tahat, kisi nirdhaarit vastu ke daam evam uski maatra ke vipareet sambandh ko pradarshit karata he, jis prakaar se ; q {x} = f (P {x}; Partial P_ {x} <0,} uparokt sameekaran darshata he ki, jab vastu kii maang eks-aksh par hoti he or keemat vaai-aksh par, donon k badhane yaa ghatane se maang vakr banataa he jise demand shedul bhi kaha jaataa he
 The downward nature of a general demand curve reflects the inverse relationship between nature, quantity demanded and price
 isliye, neeche kii ore dhalaan maang vakr maang ke kanoon ko darshata he
 Note that "demand" and "quantity demanded" are used in economic lexicon to mean different things
 ek taraf, "maang" puri maang vakr ko sanderbhit karata he, jo maatra kii maang or keemat ke bich ke sambandh he
 The change in demand is graphically represented by a change in the demand curve
 duusari ore, "maang kii gai maatra" upabhoktaaon kii maatra ko sanderbhit karne ke liye di gai keemat, duusare nirdharakon ke liye sashart chaahate hai
 The "change in quantity demand" is graphically represented by a movement along the demand curve
 aam taur par vastu kii maang tab babbti he jab us vastu ke keemat main girav aata he or thik iske vipareet mulya main badhotaree ke saath vastu kii maang kii gai raashi gir jaati he
 In some cases, however, this may not be true
 There are some items that do not follow this law
 inamen or gifen maal shaamil hai iske alaava apwaad or vivaran neeche die gaye anubhaagon main die gaye hai
 Initially proposed by Sir 'robert Giffen', economists disagreed over the existence of Giffen goods in the market
 ek giffen vastu ek neech vastu kaa varnan karti he ki jisaki keemat badhane se, utpaada badhane kii maang hoti he
 For example, during the Irish Batata famine of the 19th century, potatoes were considered a Giffen item
 Potatoes were the largest staple in the Irish diet, so income increases had a large impact on price
 logon ne maance or subjiyon jaise vilasita ke saamaan kaatane se jawaab diya or badale main adhik aalu kharida
 Therefore, as the price of potatoes increased, so did the quantity demanded
 yadi kisi vastu kii keemat main vruddhi, ek vastu kii keemat main or badhotaree kii ummid karne kaa kaaran banati he, to ve vartmaan main badi hui keemat par bhi adhik se adhik vastu khareednaa shuru kar sakate hai
 Similarly, if the price of a commodity is expected to decrease, it can postpone its purchase
 is prakaar, kuch tark karte hai ki aise maamalon main maang kaa kanoon ulanghan kiya jaataa he
 In this case, the demand curve does not slope down from left to right; This in turn presents a backward slope from top to bottom as it is known as an extraordinary demand curve
 jin saamaanon ko logon kii keemat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, unke liye buniyadi yaa aavashyak vasteen kitni hi zaruri hai beemaa dwaara cover dawaaen ek acha udhaaharan hai
 The increase or decrease in the price of such good value does not demand its quantity
 in vastuon kaa puri tarah se sambandh nahin he, kyonki keemat main koi bhi badlaav maang kii gai maatra main nahin badalata he

 Indra, who was studying only till class three, got the help of Dr
 Bhagwan Lal Indraji, he recognized the hidden scholar in Indraji and with his help, Indra became a master of botany
 vanaspati shaastra par indraji ne sabase pehle 1910 main ek gujarati pustak likhi jiskaa naam tha ” vanaspati shaastra“
 Seeing this book, the British scholars of that time were shocked and urged Indraji to write this book in English, then his answer was: aap angrej bharat ke kisi bhi praant main paidaa hone wali vanaspati ko pahchaan sakate ho, hind kii vanspati par pustak bhi likhte ho parantu ham hamaare yahan paidaa hone vaali vanaspati ko nahin pahchaan pate hai; aap jis paddati se duniyaan bhar kii vanaspati ko pahchaan lete ho usee paddati ko main apane desh vaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hun at: maine is pustak ko gujarati main hi likhane kaa nishchay kiya he
 In this book of 755 pages and worth 10 rupees, Indra ji described about 611 flora, how to identify vegetation as well as the use of vegetation through Gujarati verses and couplets poems
 isi pustak ko pard kar gandhiji ne apane africa vaas ke dauraan neem ko dawaai ke rup main upyog main liya tha
 But it is a pity that even after publishing the book by pledging his wife's jewelry, this book did not sell so much
 yani pustak kii pehali aavruti bikne main lagbhag 17 varsh biit gayi par indraji niraash nahin hue or kuccha ke maharaja ke anurodh or sahyog se unhone duusari pustak likhi jiskaa naam tha “kuccha ni jadi buttiyon“
 In this book, Indraji gave an illustrated introduction to about 100 herbs
 us jamaane main vanaspati shaastra kii pustakon ko sahitya kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa tha is vajah se yah pustak bhi itani prasiddh nahin ho pai, parantu banaras hindu vishwa vidhyalay ke mahaamanaa pan madan mohan malviya ne indra ji ko nimantran diya ki ve kaashi aawein or vanaspati shaastra main sahayata karen
 "I would be very grateful if you come here and experience the joy of Kashi habitat in the circle of scholars and give consent and help in creating Botanical Forest Botenical Garden to help in the salvation and advancement of Ayurveda
" parantu vriddhavastha kii vajah se indraji, pan madan mohan malviya kaa prastaav sweekaar nahin sake or unhone likhaa: "now this body is 76 years old, Karna is deaf, there is a tooth left in the mouth
 barason tak jangal main bhatakane se ab qamar bhi akad rahi he



 deepotsav ke baad swasthy hoga to ek samay banaras vishwavidhyalay ke ayurvedic vibhaag main vanaspati van ke darshan kar krutharth hounga
 But Jayakrishna Indraji could not go to Kashi and he died in 1929 at the age of about 80

 Satellite radio is an analog or digital radio signal that is broadcast from one or more satellites and therefore can be heard over a much wider geographical area than a local FM radio station
 haalanki europe main mukhya rup se kai efem radio stesan ek atirikt anainkripted satlite fid pradaan karte hai, vahaan kai channelon kii sadsyta aadhaarit digital sankul bhi sthaneey prasaaran nahin karte hai, jisamen america ullekhneey he
 In Europe, FM radio is used by many suppliers in which many local FM repeaters use a network to broadcast a single program over a large area, usually across the country
 unamem se kai ke paas ek atirikt satlite sanket he jise mahadweep ke kai bhaagon main suna ja saktaa he
 In contrast, US terrestrial stations are always local and each of them has a unique program, although they are sometimes associated for syndicated content, but each local station still has its own commercial and news gaps
 Occur
 iskaa matlab yah he ki satlite ke madhyam se mul sthaneey steshnon kii saamagree kaa rashtriya vitaran america main koi vaastavik arth nahin rakhata, isliye vahaan satlite radio kaa ek alag tarah se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Mobile services such as Sirius, XM and worldspace allow listeners to roam the entire continent and listen to the same audio program wherever they go
 music chois yaa musac kii satlite-sanvitarit saamagree jaisi anya sevaaon ke liye ek sthir sthaan resiver or dish antena kii zarurat hoti he
 In all cases, a clear picture of the antenna should be visible to the satellite
 In areas where tall buildings, bridges, or parking garages obscure the signal, repeaters may be installed to convey the signal to listeners
 aam taur par radio sevaayen vanijyik udhyamon dwaara uplabdh karai jaati hai or ye shulk-aadhaarit hoti hai
 Various services are proprietary signals that require special hardware for decoding and playback
 aam taur par pradaata, vigyaapan rahit sangeet channelon ke saath samachar, mausam, khel or sangeet channel aadi kii vividhta pradaan karte hai
 In areas with a relatively high population density, it is easier and less expensive to reach the majority of the population with terrestrial transmissions

 Satellite radio has become a major provider of background music in the United States, particularly for businesses such as hotels, retail businesses and restaurants

 Both North American satellite radio providers offer business subscriptions, although XM Satellite's merger with Sirius Radio is uncertain for xm's future for business
 sirius kii vyavsaayik sevaayen tisare paksh ke saathi aplide media technologies corporation ke dwaara rashtriya str par pradaan kii jaati hai
 Satellite radio uses the 2
3 ghz s band in North America and in other locations typically shares the 1

 sidhe satlite prasaaran kaa yah ek prakaar he or kaaphi majboot he or ise praapt karne ke liye satlite dish kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 The curvature of the Earth limits the reach of the signal, but due to the high eyeball of the satellite, typically two or three are sufficient to provide coverage to the entire continent

 Each receiver has an electronic serial number radio ID to identify it
 jab ek ikai sadsyta ke saath sakriy ho jaati he, ek praadhikaran code ko digital stream main bheja jaataa he jisamen resiver ko avaruddh channelon ko acces karne liye anumati di jaati he
 Most services have at least one "free to air" or "in the clear" channel test
 udhaaharan ke liye, sirius 184 channel kaa upyog karata he, sirius mausam or immergency
 Most system proprietors in use are now using different codecs for audio data compression, different modulation techniques and / or encryption and conditional access methods
 anya radio sevaaon kii tarah, satlite radio bhi prayek gane ke kalakaar yaa sheershak yaa kaarykram or sambhavat channel ke naam ke saath program sambhddha data prasaarit karti he
 Satellite radio differs from AM or FM and digital television radio in the following ways
 yah talika mukhya rup se sanyukt rajya america ke liye lagu hoti he
 2 With both satellite radio providers and DTR providers the sound quality varies with each channel
 kuch channelon main sidi gunvattta audio hoti he or duusare spich ke liye nune-bandwidth upyukt audio kaa upyog karte hai
 Since then a certain amount of bandwidth is available within the license and adding more channels means that the quality of some channels should be reduced
 Both frequency response and dynamic range of satellite channels can be better than most, but not all AM or FM radio stations because most AM and FM stations clip audio for higher sound; Even the worst channels are still better than most channels, but some AM tuners are better than the best FM or satellite broadcasts when they are converted to a local station, even when the stereo is not capable
 In a moving vehicle like FM, AM does not suffer from multipath distortion or deformation, nor does it become silent like satellite radio when you go behind a big mountain
 3 kuch satlite radio sevaayen or ditiar sevaayen sthaneey eem / efem steshnon ke liye yathaavat punaravartak ke rup main kaary karte hai is prakaar rukaawat kii ucch aavriti kii ek visheshta hoti he

 america main, sabhi steshnon ke liye aavadhik stesan pahchaan or saarvajanik seva ghoshnaaen kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the 5 United States, the FCC regulates only technical broadcast spectrum
 kaarykram saamagree aniyamit hoti he
 However, the FCC had in the past tried to gain access to its regulated content for satellite radio and cable television, and its options are still open in the future
 epasisi donon satlite radio pradaataaon ke liye license jari karata he or in prasaaran karne vaale licendhariyon kaa niyantran karata he
 6 The degree of regulation content varies by country, but the majority of industrialized countries have regulations regarding pornographic and / or offensive content
 aap jahaan kahin bhi jate hai portable satlite radio aapako satlite radio sunne kii suvidha pradaan karata he
 These are quite equivalent to the standard portable music player, which is designed for music
 tathaapi, yah visheshta bhitari rup se bane antena main hota he jo satlite signal praapt karata he or yah richargeble bydaree ke saath aata he
 In fact, all you have to do is plug the headphones in and you can easily listen to it and take it anywhere
 haalanki imaaraton or vrikshon ke ghiraav ke kaaran signal praapt karne main thodi mushkil ho sakati he or kabhi-kabhi aapke sharir ke kaaran bhi kyonki aap use kis ore rakhte hai or kis prakaar lekar jate hai, is par bhi nirbhar karata he
 However, it is best served in open spaces
 july 2008 main ek vilay ke baad sanyukt rajya america or canada main ek holding company, sirius exem radio do satlite radio sevaaon ko sanchalit karata he
 a monthly fee is applied for both services
 Some XM music channels are advertisements while Sirius is ad-free
 donon sevaaon ke paas vigyaapan-mukt sangeet stesan ke saath-saath vaartalap or samachar stesan bhi hai, jinamein se kuch main vigyapanon ko shaamil karte hai
 XM uses fixed-location geostationary satellites from two locations, and Sirius uses three geosynchronous satellites to transmit the digital stream, passing extremely elliptical eyeballs to North and South America
 shuddh antar yah he ki america ke uttari bhaag main sirius sanket ek ucch oonchai kone se aata he or canada main isse bhi zyada sirius sanket aata he
 Both services are available primarily in automobiles via portable receivers, but both have many accessories so one can listen through a home stereo with a portable boombox, or even online via a personal computer
 
 donon sevaaon ke paas resiver ke kuch farm he jo ki puri tarah se portable he
 The major asset of satellite radio is that it is not local: drivers can receive the same programming anywhere in the service's footprint
 ek trek stop par koi stop laang-hole drivers ke bich sirius exem kii lokapriyata ko pradarshit karegaa
 iske alaava, exem or sirius donon jis programing ko praapt karte hai jo ki keval vanijyik radio steshnon par praapt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Special stations offer programs such as family talk, radio drama, classical music and live events
 sirius or exem donon kaa footprint keval sanyukt rajya, canada, mexico kaa upree teesraa he; jis prakaar satlite tivi karti he vaisaa yah hawaii cover nahin karti
 As of July 29, 2008, Sirius XM claimed over 18

 satlite radio kii safalataa kaa ek mahatvapurn kaarak car main resiwaron kii tainaati he
 Sirius XM has attempted to convince auto manufacturers to design vehicles with their receivers
 2008 tak, nimna nirmaataaon ne mul upkaran ke rup main satlite radio kii peshkash kii: From 2007 to 2012, Sirius has exclusive contracts for VW and Audi vehicles
 un brandon ne pehle donon sevaaon kii peshkash kii thi
 GM, Honda and Suzuki are all major investors of XM; Sirius is not offered as an option in their vehicle
 bendle or rolls-royas keval resiver ke saath hi nahin balki sirius seva ke liye aaajeevan sadsyta ke saath aae
 harley-davidson ke vishesh motorcycle modelon main exem kii suvidha di gai, jabaki manoranjak vahno or naukaaon ke kai brandon main sirius ko suna ja saktaa tha
 One challenge for satellite radio was to get out of cars and reach consumers' homes
 kai portable satlite radio resiver kaa nirmaan isi uddeshy ke liye kiya gaya
 exem satlite radio ne "walkmen-like" portable resiver kii xm2go line kaa vikaas kiya, jaise delphi miphai, pyniyar airwayre or jiyaant international ke taao
 exem kshamta ke saath polk audio ek ghatak-style main home exem refrence tuner or ek tebletop manoranjan pranali, ai-sonic banaata he
 Sirius developed the Kenwood portable satellite radio tuner, Sirius S50, Here 2 Anywhere and Sirius Stiletto 100
 exem ke liye pyniyar inno or samsung heliks baad main sunaane ke liye live kaarykram ko recording karne kii kshamta kii peshkash karne vaale pehle portable resiwaron ke bich main the
 Thus it allows satellite radio to compete with MP3 players
 jabaki vaahan nirmaataaon ke saath mahatvapurn samjhaute abhi bhi kiye ja rahe the, donon companiyon ne keval car main satlite radio se dur chalaang lagaai or upabhoktaaon ke gharon main pahunche
 a bump in the road led to more widespread use in the home and both Sirius and XM have been running into legal issues regarding internal FM transmitters in early 2006 with their FCC
 iske liye sirius or exem ko shelf se apane kai model ko baahar nikaalane kii aavashyaktaa thi or samasya k samaadhaan karnaa tha
 The FCC claimed that the internal FM transmitter's emissions were too powerful and needed to be lowered
 in parivartanon ke saath koi bhi graahak ek nayaa satlite radio resiver kharidta he to vah puraane model ke rup main prasaarit duuri ko praapt nahin karata he
 Since this is the main point of the ability to use a satellite radio in the house, many customers have turned to using an additional personal FM transmitter such as Whole House FM Transmitter, C
 Crane Company, Griffin Technology etc
 This shifted the low power internal FM transmitter
 chunki ye bahari efem transmeter bhaag 15 anuvarthi rahe hai or naye aantarik efem transmeter jo satlite radio main shaamil he, kii bajaae ve sanket prasaaran adhik kar sakate hai or ab bhi yah kanoonee he
 This may prevent the slow progress of satellite radios reached in the consumer home market for external FM transmitter Sirius and XM radios
 satlite radio praudyogiki ko 2002 main spes foundation antareeksh praudyogiki of fem main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 On 1 November 2004, the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission began hearing Canada's first satellite radio operation
 Three applications were filed: first by Standard Broadcasting and CBC in partnership with Sirius, second by Canadian Satellite Radio in partnership with XM and third by CHUM Limited and Astral Media at the last minute
 pehle do samroop pranali kaa istemaal karenge jinhone america ke liye seoup kar chuke the, jabaki siechauem kaa aavedan satlite se sidhe prasaaran kii bajaae maujuuda sthaliy diabi transmeter ke madhyam se ek sadsyta radio seva ke liye tha 
 siechauem seva sabhi prakaar se canadai he, anya do aavedan canada-utpaadit channelon or unke america saajhedaaron kii seva se maujuuda channel ke ek mishran ke prastaav kii peshkash he
 There is already a small "gray market" of Sirius and XM receivers in Canada in which Canada will have a US order receiver setup
 16 june 2005 ko, siartisi ne sabhi teen sevaaon ko sweekruti di
 In its decision, the CRTC required the following conditions from satellite radio licensees: ye sharten maujuuda canadian saamagree niyamon kaa vistaar tha jo canada ke sabhi prasarakon ke liye lagu tha
