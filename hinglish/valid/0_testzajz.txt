 a social movement is a type of 'collective action'
 saamaajik aandolan vyaktiyon or / yaa sanghathanon ke vishaal anaupchaarik samooh hote hai jinka dhyey kisi vishisht saamaajik mudde par kendrit hota he
 In other words, they want to make a social change, oppose it or put an end to any social change and bring it back to its predecessor aadhunik paashchaatya jagat main saamaajik aandolan shiksha ke prasar ke dwaara tathaa unnisvin shadi main audyogikaran va nagarikaran ke kaaran shramikon ke avaagaman main vruddhi ke kaaran sambhav hue
 Modern movements take the help of technology and internet to awaken people all over the world
 bharat ke saamaajik aandolan ke sabase bade mahanayake dow babasaheb ambedkar he
 The powerful social movement of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar is one of the most influential movements in the world and India's most influential social movement
 babasaheb kaa aandolan bharat desh ke pichhade, garib, shoshit, dalit logon ko unke saamaajik, aarthik, dharmik, rajnatik visheshat: maanav adhikaar dene ke liye tha, yah bharat kii sabase bady saamaajik kranti bhi thi
 Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar was the creator of the constitution, so he fought for the rights of the exploited people of the country and succeeded in it
 dow babasaheb ambedkar ji ke mahaad satyagrah yaa chavadaar talab andolan, nashik kaa kalaram mandir andolan or dalit buddha andolan prasiddh he
 Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar is ranked among the top human rights activists in the world
 raajnneetik bhagidaari ke sansthagat daayaron ke baahar parivartankami raajnneeti karne vaale andolanon ko saamaajik andolanon kii sangya di jaati he
 These agitational structures that have taken collective political action for a long time also serve as informal threads between the civil society and the political system
 haalaanki zyaadaatar saamaajik andolan sarkari niti yaa aacharan ke kilaaf karyrat rahete hai, lekin swatahspoort yaa asangathit pratirodh yaa karrwai ko saamaajik andolan nahin mana jaataa
 It requires a clear leadership and a decision-making framework
 andolan main bhaag lene waalon ke liye kisi saajha makasad or vichaardhaara kaa hona bhi aavashyak he
 Do these not happen in any political party or pressure group working in the formal circles of politics? Indeed, social movements in their basic character are formed by the interaction of informal networks
 ve aise mudde chunate hai jinhen aupchaarik raajnneeti apnaane se inkaar kar detii he
 At the same time, they use non-traditional forms of resistance and mobilization
 saamaajik andolanon ne alpsankhyakon, hashiyagrast samoohon or adhikaar-vanchit tabakon kii raajnneeti ko badhaava diya he
 For this reason, it is also believed that contemporary democracy is indebted to social movements for its expansion and depth
 dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke baad global or rashtriya raajnneetik pranaaliyon main is parighatna kaa udai hua
 Behind them were such personalities, networks, groups and organizations that aimed to influence society, state and public policies outside the scope of formal politics in terms of public interest
 pichley saath varshon main saamaajik andolanon ne raajnneetik pranaaliyon or loktantrikaran kii prakriya par ullekhneey asar daalaa he
 The movement of environment, anti-war movement, movement of unorganized workers, movement of women rights, movement of alternative sexualities all over the world are proof of the success of this phenomenon
 vittiya poonji ke bhoomandaleekaran se upji jan-virdohi pravritiyon ke kilaaf chal rahe andolan bhi isi shrenee main aate hai
 One of the strengths of social movements is that even if their political actions give importance to localism or land affiliation or the relationship of grassroots, they see and define problems and issues in increasingly global contexts
 isi kaaran se ve sthaneey str par chalaai ja rahi pratirodh kii karravaayiyon ko global netvacag ke zariye tikaane main samarth ho pate hai
 Their slogan is 'think Globally, Act Local'

 The middle class, which emerged in Western countries after World War II, felt itself politically, culturally and intellectually distinct from older class-based movements, preferring to adopt forms of collective political action that had a wide range of moral, cultural And there were social issues
 is jamaane main chale kai saamaajik andolan naagarik adhikaron, stri-adhikaron, yuddh kaa virodh karne or paryaavaran kii hifaazat karne ke agrahon ke ird-gird golband hue
 By the sixties, the activities of these movements increased greatly in Europe and North America
 inhen raajnneetik kamyaabi bhi milane lagi
 Seeing this, social scientists started studying this phenomenon
 saamaajik andolanon ko samajhane ke liye sabase pehle manovigyaan kaa prayog kiya gaya
 This highlighted the collective behavior of the agitating people, groups and networks
 duusari tarika sanrachanagat-prakaarywaadee kism kaa tha
 He tried to see what effect these movements were having on social stability
 maas socity kaa adhyayan karne vaale manovaigyanikon ko laga ki saamaajik andolan nijee tanaav se jujh rahe vyaktiyon kii abhivyaktiyaan hai
 On the other hand, structuralist-functionalist scholars thought that these movements were the result of tensions in the social system
 sattar ke dashak main is anusandhan ne nayi karavat badali
 Behind this change was the influence of the new student movements and the actions of resistance emanating from them
 ek naye siddhant ne janm liya jise ‘risource mobilizeshan’ thiyari ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory saw social movements as a social process under which political entrepreneurs first make rational accumulation of resources for the intended social change and then use the resources to achieve goals
 is siddhant ke pairokaar maanate hai ki saamaajik andolan puri tarah se apni sansaadhan uplabdh kar paane kii kshamta par hi nirbhar karte hai
 These resources can also be based on mobilizing economic and human cooperation and can also have their origins in moral concerns and authority, etc
 saamaajik andolanon kii samaj banane kii prakriya main ek thiyari santhnik vyavhaar ke adhyayan ke rup main bhi viksit hui
 He tried to understand the social movement like any other organized group
 aage chal kar kai vidwaanon ne saamaajik andolanon or sansthagat raajnneeti ke bich anyonyakriya par vishesh dhyaan diya jisase raajnneeti ko prakriyaaon ke rup main samajhane ke pariprekshya kaa vikaas hua
 Some research in the eighties focused on several leftist movements

 This research, based on the land of Europe and the perspective of the same, made the movement of culture and identity as its subject matter
 unhone dekha ki paryaavaran sambadhi andolan or stri-adhikaron ke liye hone vaale andolan kis prakaar pratirodh ke naye-anuthe taur-tareeke istemaal kar rahe hai
 This discussion led to the thesis of neo-social movements
 darasal, assi or nabbe ke dauraan prakaash main aayi yah thisis vampanth kii sthapit samaj ko chunauti dene vaali sabit hui
 Earlier leftist political action was understood to mean nothing other than class-based activity
 lekin, jab america main afro- ameriganon ne apane adhikaron ke samarthan main blike power or blike penther jaise radical or jujharu andolan chalaaye; jab vietnam yuddh ke kilaaf samrajyavad virdohi muhimen sangathit kii gayin; jab anuvik nihshastreekaran ke paksh main shanti andolan chalaa; jab radical feminimum ne apni daavedaariyaan pesh kin; or jab hawa or pani ke pradooshan ke kilaaf awaz buland kii gayi, to varg sangharsh ko hi kendriya saamaajik antarvirodh maanane vaali drushti ko prashnaankit hona padaa
 There was an ideological diversity in these movements
 inaki zamin bhi ek-duusare se bhinn dikh rahi thi
 Rejecting the traditional Marxist understanding, Andre Grose, Rudolf Bahro, Ellen Thouren and Yurgan Habermas claimed in their own way that class is no longer an effective suffix for socio-political identity and political action
 
 in vidwaanon ne nav-saamaajik andolanon ko uttar- audyogic saamaajik sanrachanaon kii paidaaish qaraar diya
 He said that the philanthropic state has largely neutralized the old forms of exploitation
 nayi paristhitiyon main aadhunik samaaj paraayepan ke naye roopon ko janm de rahaa he
 Neo-social movements are making the disturbance arising from this their center
 francisi samajashastri elaan turin ne da ritern of da actor kii rachana kii
 Taking a radical stand, Thouren appealed that sociologists should not be confined to mere interpretation of social movements and participate in them deeply

 Now scholars are paying special attention to the role of networks in the social movement

anya praddh vyaktiyon ke photo lete hai
 They often take photographs of various activities of their daily lives
 beesvin shatabdi ke uttararddh main akhbaari photographron kaa yah bilkul nayaa pesha saamne aayaa
 The paparazzi follow the celebrity of politics, sports, film or any department and secure such facts of their daily life in their camera which is very interesting and sensational for the viewers
 papaaratsi photographer sho bijnes kii duniya main vishesh rup se badnaam hai kyonki un ke jasoos camaron kii ankhen kala jagat ke vikhyath sitaron kaa peechha karti rahati hai or un prasiddh kalakaaron ke liye tanhaai main ek chan bhi bitaana mushakil ho jaataa he
 Paparatsi is an Italian word and is pronounced Paparatsi
 pehali baar 50 ke dashak main suna gaya tha jab rome ke kuch yuva photographron ne misr ke shah faruq ke kuch nijee chitra prakashit kara die
 But by that time the term Paparatsi was not known, but such people were used to refer to derogatory names like Street Photographer
 in logon ke peshey ko lekar us samay kaafii aalochana shuru ho gai jab rajkumaari dyna kii ek durghatana main maut hui
 One idea about this car accident was that all of the paparazzi were photographed by photographers who chased them like hunting dogs to take photos of Princess Diana and her lover
 mularoop se yah ek italvi naam he or sirf ek film ke kaaran yah prasiddh ho gaya
 In 1960, the famous Italian director Car Federico Flaney intended to film the life of a young photographer who first took a picture of Shah Farooq in a restaurant in which he appeared outraged and in anger
 a table was inverted in the state
 film main is paatr kaa naam coriolano papaaratso he
 Director Federico Flaney was once asked how he thought of the name for his character, so he told that in the old travelogue of an English tourist, there was a mention of an inn whose owner's name was Paparatso, the same name was affixed to my mind
 And when actor Marcillo Mastriani was selected for the character of photographer in the film, he too liked the name
 lekin us samay donon ko is baat kaa gyaan nahin tha ki unhone angrezi bhashaa ko ekadam nayaa shabd diya he

 a Brahmin named Sukarma lived near the Devagiri mountain in the south country with his husband Parayana wife Sudesh
 ve donon shiv bhakt the kintu santaan na hone se chintit rahete the
 On the wife's request, he married his wife's sister Ghushma, who was a supreme Shiva devotee
 shiv krupa se use ek putr dhan kii prapti hui
 This led to the envy of Sudesh and he found the opportunity and killed the son of Saut
 bhagwaan shivaji kii krupa se balak ji uthaa tathaa ghusma kii prarthana par vahaan shivaji sadaiv vaas karne kaa vardaan diya or vahaan par vaas karne lage or ghushmeshwar ke naam se prasikad huen us talab kaa naam bhi tabase shivalay ho gaya
 This legend is described in the Puranas about this Jyotirlinga - Near the Devgiriparvat in the south country, there lived a very bright Taponishta Brahmin named Sudharma
 uski patni kaa naam sudeha tha donon main paraspar bahut prem tha
 He had no trouble of any kind
 lekin unhen koi santan nahin thi
 Astrology-calculation showed that childbirth cannot be born from the womb of Sudeha
 sudeha santan kii bahut hi icchhuk thi
 He urges Sudharma to remarry to his younger sister
 pehle to sudharma ko yah baat nahin janchi
 But in the end he had to bow to the wife's insistence
 ve uskaa aagrah taal nahin paae
 He married his wife's younger sister Ghushma and brought them home
 ghushma atyant vineet or sadaacharini stri thi
 She was the exclusive devotee of Lord Shiva
 pratidin ek sau ek parthiv shivlinga banaakar hriday kii sachhee nishtha ke saath unka pujan karti thi
 By the grace of Lord Shiva, a very beautiful and healthy child was born from his womb just a few days later
 bachche ke janm se sudeha or ghushma donon ke hi anand kaa paar na rahaa
 Both days were passing by very comfortably
 lekin na jane kaise thode hi dinon baad sudeha ke man main ek kuvichaar ne janm le liya
 She started thinking, i have nothing in this house
 sab kuch ghushma kaa he
 By now, the sprout of Sudharma's mind had taken the form of a huge tree
 antat ek din usne ghushma ke yuva putr ko raat main sote samay maar daalaa
 Taking his dead body, he threw it in the same pond in which Ghushma used to throw the earthly Shivling daily
 mere pati par bhi usne adhikaar jamaa liya
 He also has children
 yah kuvichaar dhire-dhire uske man main badhane laga
 Here Ghushma's child was also growing up
 dhire-dhire vah jawan ho gaya
 He was also married
 subah hote hi sabko is baat kaa pataa laga
 There was a furore in the whole house
 sudharma or uski putravadhu donon sir petakar foot-footkar rone lage
 But Ghushma, as usual, was engrossed in worshiping Lord Shiva
 jaise kuch hua hi na ho
 After finishing the puja, she started to leave the earthly Shivalingas in the pond
 jab vah talab se lautne lagi usee samay uskaa pyaara laal talab ke bheetar se nikalakar aata hua dikhalaai padaa
 He always came and fell at the feet of Ghushma
 jaise kahin aas-paas se hi ghumkar aa rahaa ho
 At the same time, Lord Shiva also appeared there and started asking Ghushma to ask for the groom
 vah sudeha kii ghanouni karatuut se atyant cruddh ho uthe the
 He was looking forward to cutting his throat with his trident
 ghushma ne haath jodakar bhagavan shiv se kaha- 'prabho! yadi aap mujh par prasann hai to meri us abhaagin bahan ko kshamaa kar den
 Surely he has committed a very heinous sin, but by your mercy i got my son back
 ab aap use kshamaa karen or prabho! My one more prayer is, for the welfare of the people, you should stay in this place forever
 ' bhagavan shiv ne uski ye donon baaten sweekaar kar leen
 Appearing as Jyotirlinga, he started living there
 sati shivbhakt ghushma ke aradhy hone ke kaaran ve yahan ghushmeshwar mahadev ke naam se vikhyath hue
 The glory of ghushmeshwar-jyotirlinga is described in great detail in the Puranas
 inkaa darshan lok-paralok donon ke liye amogh faldaai he

 Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai is a 2000 Hindi language film
 is film ke nirdeshak or lekhak rakesh roshan hai
 Through this film, Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel started their acting journey in films
 isamen ruthik roshan rohit or raaj kii dohari bhoomika nibhaaen hai
 The film was the most successful film of 2000
 ise bahut adhik puraskaar bhi mili
 Rakesh Roshan received the Filmfare Award for the first time as a producer and director for this film
 sarvshereshth abhinayta or sarvshereshth navdith abhinayta ke liye ruthik roshan ko ek hi film main yah donon puraskaar bhi mil gaya
 Rohit and his younger brother Amit are orphans, who live here with Lily and Anthony
 rohit ek bahut acha gayak bananaa chahta he or car bechney vaale dukaan main kaam karata he
 Saxena takes a car for his daughter Sonia Saxena one day
 jab rohit car ko unke ghar main dene jaataa he to use pataa chalata he ki yah uske janmdin kaa tohfa he
 No one knows that the owner of that car shop and Saxena are running a gang of drugs
 isamen do police afasar bhi shaamil hai
 Sonia and her friends keep partying and Rohit keeps singing along with her
 uske gane ko sun kar atul use apane party main bula letaa he
 By mistake, both Rohit and Sonia get drunk and fall on the lifeboat
 naav dhire dhire chalane lagati he or bahut dur chale jaati he
 The two live together in an island for some time
 isi dauraan unhen pyaar ho jaataa he
 After a while Saxena saves them
 jab saxena ko donon ke pyaar kaa pataa chalata he to vah apane dost ko kahata he ki rohit ko kaam se hataa de
 Even after this, Sonia's love for Rohit does not diminish
 vah rohit se baat karata he ki yadi wo kuch bahut bada kaam kar letaa he to vah uski shaadi kara degaa
 Rohit and his friends organize Concert
 koncert kii shaam jab rohit amit ko uske vidhyalay se laata he to bich main wo donon dekhte hai ki ek bhrashtachari pulicekarmi or malik mil kar kamishnar ko maarthe rahe hai
 Because he gets to know about the drugs
 uske baad un donon ko rohit ke hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Rohit runs away and falls through the culvert into the river
 use tairnaa nahin aata he
 Sonia and everyone else think that she has died
 sonia ko uske pita newjiland main uske bhai ke paas bhej dete hai
 There Nita helps him forget Rohit
 vah use apane dost raaj chopra se milaati he
 His face is exactly like Rohit and he is also a good singer
 raaj ke chehre ke kaaran sonia or duhkhi ho jaati he
 Raj comes to India after knowing the whole story
 vahaan aate saath ek police vaala use maarane kii koshish karata he
 After this, Raj feels that someone wanted to kill Rohit
 isse raaj or sonia ko pataa chal jaataa he ki rohit kii hatya hui he
 Raj goes to Rohit's house where he learns that Amit is aware of Rohit's killers
 raaj un hatyaron ko pakadaney ke liye jaal banane ke bare main sochataa he
 Only he and Sonia knew the truth of his rule
 vah phir se koncert karne kii ghoshnaa karata he taaki vahaan hatyare bhi aayen or amit unhen pahchaan le
 He also says that those who were trying to kill him will also name him
 rohit ko jivit dekh kar uske hatyare dar jate hai
 Sonia tells Saxena the truth that she is Rohit and not Raj
 iske baad saxena usee samay malik or us bhrasht afasar ko sachai bataa detaa he
 Malik feels that Saxena is framing those people, because Rohit has not seen Saxena so he will not take his name but will take both of them
 is kaaran vah rohit ko goli maar detaa he
 But that security is already in place
 is kaaran vah batch jaataa he
 The corrupt officer then kidnaps Sonia
 lekin raaj use bachaane main safal ho jaataa he
 Malik comes there and he is about to tell Sonia and Raj about Saxena that Saxena shoots him
 amit bataata he ki malik kisi saraji se phone par baat kar rahaa tha
 Raj calls Sarji from Malik's phone
 usee samay saxena kaa mobile bajane lagata he
 After this, Raj understands everything
 saxena sabase saamne apana gunaah kabul kar letaa he
 Sonia and Raj go to New Zealand with Amit and they get engaged
 sangeet rajesh roshan dwaara diya gaya he or gaanon main nrity sangyojan farah khan dwaara kiya gaya he
 The album was the best selling album of the year
 kaho naa pyaar he film men pehle karina kapur khan ko cast kiya gaya tha
 Kareena's mother Babita had a disagreement with Rakesh Roshan and Kareena left the film
 phir rakesh ji ne ek nayi ladki ko cast kar shuting shuru kii
 Thus, this film became Amisha's debut film and not Kareena's debut film

 70,000 Zoroastrianism is the prevalent religion of Iran since ancient times
 ye zand avesta naam ke dharmagranth par aadhaarit he
 Its founder is Mahatma Zarathushtra, hence this religion is also called Zarathushtri religion
 zand avesta ke ab kuch hi ansh milte hai
 Its oldest parts can be from the period immediately after the Rigveda
 isaki bhashaa avestan bhashaa he, jo sanskrit bhashaa se bahut, bahut mail khaati he
 The teaching of Zoroastrianism is: Humat, Hukht, Huvrushta, which in Sanskrit was Sumat, Sukta, Suvarna or Subuddhi, Subhash, Subhuktaan
 parsi ek ishwar ko maanate hai, jise ahura mazda kehete hai
 His description is very similar to the Vedic deity Varuna
 agni ko ishvarputra samaan or atyant pavitra mana jaataa he
 It is through this that Ahura Mazda is worshiped
 parsi mandiron ko aatish beharam kaha jaataa he
 Spenta Amesha is their seven angels
 verigod According to Parsi belief, Ahura Mazda's enemy is the evil Angira Manu
 ek jamaane main parsi dharm iran kaa rajdharm hua karata tha
 He took refuge in India
 tabase aaj tak parsiyon ne bharat ke udai main bahut bada yogadan diya he
 When ancient Persia was a vast empire stretching from Eastern Europe to Central Asia, the Prophet Zarathustra laid the foundation of Zoroastrianism, conveying a theism
 zarathustra va unke anuyaayiyon ke bare main vistrut itihaas gyaat nahin he
 The reason is that first Alexander's forces and later Arab invaders destroyed almost all the religious and cultural literature of ancient Persia
 aaj ham is itihaas ke bare main jo kuch bhi jaanate hai, vah iran ke pahaado main utkeern shila lekhon tathaa vaachik parampara kii badaulat he
 By the seventh century AD, the Persian Empire had lost its archaic splendor and power
 jab arabon ne is par nirnaayak vijay praapt kar lee to apane dharm kii raksha hetu anek jarathosti dharmavalambee samudr ke raste bhaag nikle or unhone bharat ke pashchimi tat par sharan lee
 Here they were called 'parsis'
 aaj vishvabhar main maatr sava se dedh lakh ke bich jarathosti hai
 More than half of these are in India
 faras ke shahenshaah vishtasp ke shasankaal main pangbar zarathustra ne dur-dur tak bhraman kar apana sandesh diya
 According to him God is only one
 is ishwar ko zarathustra ne 'ahura majadaa' kaha arthath 'mahaan jivan daata'
 Ahura Mazda is not a person, but is a sattva, a force, an energy
 zarathustra ke darshananusaar vishwa main do aadya atmaaon ke bich nirantar sangharsh jari he
 One of them is the soul of Ahura Mazda, 'spenta Menu'
 duusari he dusht aatma 'angharaa manu'
 To destroy this evil spirit, Ahura Mazda created this material world with his seven works namely sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, humans and fire
 ve jaanate the ki apni vidhwanskaari prakruti tathaa agyaan ke chalate angharaa manu is vishwa par hamalaa karegaa or isamen avyavashtha, asaty, dukh, krurta, rugnataa evam mrityu kaa pravesh kara degaa
 Man, the masterpiece of Ahura Mazda, has a central role in this struggle
 use swechha se is sangharsh main buree aatma se loha lenaa he
 In this war, his weapons will be goodness, truth, strength, devotion, ideal and immortality
 in siddhanton par amal kar maanav antat vishwa kii tamaam buraai ko samaapt kar degaa
 Some more scientific interpreters interpret religion's 'spenta menu' differently
 iske anusaar 'spenta manu' koi aatma nahin, balki sanvriddhishil, pragatisheel man athwa maansikta he
 Meaning is, it is a quality of Ahura Mazda, the quality that creates and universe
 ishwar ne spenta manu kaa srijan isiilie kiya tha ki ek aanandadaayak vishwa kaa nirmaan kiya ja sake
 The progressive mindset divides human beings into two classes on earth
 sadaachari, jo vishwa kaa sanvardhan karte hai tathaa duraachaari, jo isaki pragati ko rokte hai
 Zarathustra wants that every person should be like God, adopt life-giving energy and be the carrier of creation, enrichment and progress
 paigambar zarathustra ke upadeshon ke anusaar vishwa ek naitik vyavastha he
 This system has not only to maintain itself, but also to develop and enhance itself
 jarathosti dharm main jadta kii anumati nahin he
 Evil forces hamper the process of development, but man is not to be distracted by it
 use sadachaar ke path kar kaayam rahete hue sadaa vikaas kii disha main badhate rahanaa he
 Each moment of life has a definite purpose
 yah koi anayas shuru hokar anayas hi samaapt ho jane vaali cheez nahin he
 Everything is according to God's plan
 sarvocch achchhai hi hamaare jivan kaa uddeshy hona chahie
 Man has to live with goodness, through goodness, for goodness
 'humat', 'huukt' tathaa 'huvarshat' jarathosti jivan paddati ke aadhaar stambh hai
 Zoroastrianism prohibits monasticism, celibacy, fasting, self-suppression etc
 aisa mana gaya he ki inase manushya kamjor hota he or buraai se ladane kii uski takat kam ho jaati he
 Pessimism and depression have been given the status of sin
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki maanav is vishwa kaa puraa anand uthaae, khush rahe
 Whatever he does, just be sure of one thing and that never deviate from the path of virtue
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon se sampann jivan kii manaahi nahin he, lekin yah bhi kaha gaya he ki samaaj se tum jitna lete ho, usase adhik use do
 To get something by killing or exploiting someone is a misdemeanor
 jo hamase kam sampann hai, unki sadaiv madad karnaa chahie
 In Zarathosti religion, death is considered a temporary victory of evil
 iske baad mritak kii aatma kaa insaaf hoga
 If she is virtuous, then she will be inhabited by joy and light, and if misdemeanor, she will go into the depths of darkness and despair, but this state of vicious soul is also temporary
 aakhir jarathosti dharm vishwa kaa antim uddeshy achchhai kii jeet ko maanata he, buraai kii sajaa ko nahin
 Hence it is believed that eventually many liberators will come and complete the victory of good over evil

 ek sadi pehle tak puure dakshin purv asia main badi taadaad main paye jane vaala junglee bhainsa aaj keval bharat, nepal, burma or thailand main hi paaya jaataa he
 It is found in Kaziranga and Manas National Parks in India
 madhya bharat main yah chhattisgarh main raipur sambhag or bastar main paaya jaataa he
 Their recorded number in Chhattisgarh is eight, which is now being kept in a safe circle and their breeding program is being run
 lekin usamen bhi samasya yah he ki maadaa keval ek he or us maadaa par bhi ek gramin kaa daawa he, ki vah uski paaltu bhens he
 Well the villager has been compensated but the problem remains, the female is giving birth to only male cubs, so far she has given birth to two male calves
 pehle nar shaavak ke janm ke baad hi van adhikariton ne maadaa shaavak ke janm ke liye puja paath or mannaton tak kaa sahaara liya
 Moreover, the government even went a step further and appointed a female head in the garden so that the female buffalo got some hint, but the result was the same, the female again gave birth to the male cub
 shaayad paaltu bhainson par lagu hone vaali kahawat ki bhens ke aage been bajaaye bhens khadi paguravai junglee bhainson par bhi lagu hoti he
 The female gives birth to 5 cubs during her life time, her life span is 9 years
 nar shaavak do varsh kii umr main jhund chhod dete hai
 Cubs are often born at the end of the rainy season
 aam taur par maadaa junglee bhaisen or shaavak jhund bana kar rahati he or nar jhund se alag rahete hai par yadi jhund kii koi maadaa garbh dhaaran ke liye taiyaar hoti he to sabase taqatvar nar uske paas kisi or nar ko nahin aane detaa
 This male usually remains around the herd
 yadi kisi shaavak kii maa mar jaye to duusari maadaayen use apana leti hai
 Their natural enemy is tigers, but wild dogs and leopards have also been seen hunting them if the wild buffalo is weak, old or sick
 vaise inako sabase bada khatra paaltu maweshiyon kii sankramit bimariyon se hi he, inamen pramukh beemaari foot and mouth he
 The disease named Rederpest had at one time greatly reduced their numbers
 in par doosraa bada khatra genetic pradooshan he, junglee bhainsa paaltu bhainson se sampark sthapit kar letaa he
 Although researchers such as Flamand and Tulach believe that the wild male buffalo usually does not allow domesticated male buffaloes to approach the female but themselves approach the domesticated female buffalo, the subject is yet to be thoroughly researched
 madhya bharat ke jin ilaakon main yah paaya jaataa he, vahaan kii paaltu bhaisen bhi inase milti julati najar aati he
 This can be understood by a funny incident
 kuch varshon pehle bijapur ke van-mandladhikari shri raman pandya ke saath bambai natural history socity kii ek team junglee bhaison kaa adhyayan karne or chitra lene ke liye indravati rashtriya udyaan pahaunchi, unhen junglee bhainson kaa ek bada jhund najar aayaa or unke saikado chitra liye gayi or ek shriman jo us samay desh main junglee bhainson ke bade jaankaar maane jate the, baaki logo ko junglee bhainson or paaltu bhainson ke bich antar samajhane main vyast ho gayi tabhi achaanak ek charvaaha aayaa or sari bhainson ko haank kar le gaya
 One of the main reasons why wild buffaloes are on the verge of extinction in central India is their behavior
 jahaan ek ore gaur barish main unche sthanon par chale jate hai, vahi junglee bhainse maidaanon main kheton ke aas paas hi rahete hai or kheto ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Due to this the villagers hunt them
 ek kaaran yah bhi he ki prakritik jangalon kaa vinaash kar diya gaya he or unke sthaan par shahari jaruraton ko puraa karne vaale sagaun, saal, nilgiri jaise pedo kaa ropan kar diya he
 Some of these leaves are inedible, they do not grow the grass under which they eat, anyway wild buffalo feeds very selectively
 is kaaran bhi inkaa gaanv waalon se takaraav bahut bad gaya he
 One of the reasons for increasing conflict is that the tribals used to cultivate without the Berwa system earlier
 isame unako zyada mehnat nahin kerani padati thi
 Pieces of the forest were burnt and seeds were sprinkled in them without stirring
 raakh ek behad uttam urvarak kaa kaam karti thi
 The yield was also very good
 iske alaava jangalo main kandamul or fal bhi prachurtaa se mil jate the
 They did not lack food even from the occasional hunt
 ve kheti par purna rup se nirbhar nahin the
 Therefore, there was no hatred in them when some part of the crop was eaten by the wild animals
 or har do yaa teen saal main jagah badal liye jane ke kaaran pichhli jagah ghaas ke maidan ban jate the
 There was no shortage of fodder for the wild animals
 atah yada kada kiye jane vaale shikaar se unki sankhya main koi kami nahin aati thi
 Now, the tribals have permanent farms, whose fertility is progressively decreasing
 or iname hal chalaanaa kharpatvaar nikaalnaa or urvarak daalane jaise kaam karne padate he, jiname kaafii shram or paisa lagata he
 Apart from this, it is also not allowed to take bamboo and other forest produce for the siege of the fields, so now the tribals become known enemies of wild animals at the loss of their crops
 inhi sab karno se junglee bhainse aaj durlabhtam praaniyon ke shrenee main aa gayi hai
 Well all this has been done and it is not in our power to make up for this loss
 lekin ek jagah aisi he jo aaj tak vikaas ke vinaash se achhuti he
 The place is still the same as nature has made it through the evolutionary order of millions of years, where even today the farming is done by the merciless system and where even today the forest buffalo can be seen gracefully in large herds, where a large number of Tigers, bears, drums, mountain mynas and many other animals are living their lives in peace

 And the most regrettable thing is that our government is going to implement the schemes that they had instigated the tribals by showing fear
 abujhmaad main bina pahunche or bina koi adhyayan karaaye yahaan khadaanon kaa aavanton kiya ja rahaa he
 And this heritage of our descendants will not be destroyed because there is a scarcity of iron ore in the country, but the greed of the mine-holders who have already become wealth mines by exporting this ore has now broken all boundaries and they have become so powerful
 Are, now they dance at their behest, not leaders
 unki najaron main vanyapraani or adivaasiyon kii koi keemat nahin
 Words like natural imbalance, global warming, dehydration of rivers and famine have nothing to do with them
 jab tak duniya main ek bhi jagah rahane laayak rahegi tab tak inke paas maje se jeene kaa paisa to bharpoor hoga hi
 Due to these misdeeds, the population of wild buffaloes remaining in our forests will also be destroyed

 Research work - In 1927, the days when you started your research on space rays, the solution to this important question about these rays was being found whether these rays are made of particles with high energy or they are powerful gamma rays Is of caste

 In these experiments, the cloud was placed in a magnetic field and it was arranged that the photo of the path of the electromagnets appearing in the chamber would be automatically captured every 15 seconds at a time

 The weight of the positron is exactly equal to the load of the electron
 1936 main pazitron kii khoj ke upalaksh main aapako nobel puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya
 In connection with these experiments, Andersen also suggested that a new race of electromagnets could exist in space rays whose weight should be between the weight of electron and proton and whose electric charge was negative or equal to the charge of electron Should be of positive caste
 andersan ne inhen 'mesotron' naam diya
 Later these particles were called mesons

 Emergency measures for famine relief mainly include compensating micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals that are given through fortified chassis powders or directly through supplements
 sahaayta samoohon ne daata deshon se khaadya padaarth kharidne kii bajaay sthaneey kisaanon ko bhugtan ke liye nagad raashi dena yaa bhukhon ko nagad vauchar dene par aadhaarit akaal raahat model kaa prayog karnaa shuru kar diya he kyonki daata desh sthaneey khaadya padaarth bazaaron ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Long-term measures include investment in modern agricultural techniques such as fertilizer and irrigation, which have largely eradicated starvation in the developed world
 vishwa bank kii baadhyataaen kisaanon ke liye sarkari anudaanon ko simit karte hai or urvarkon ke adhik se adhik upyog ke anapekshit parinaamon: jal aapurtiyon or awaas par pratikul prabhaavon ke kaaran kuch paryaavaran samoohon dwaara iskaa virodh kiya jaataa he
 Definitions of famine are based on three different categories - on the basis of food supply, on the basis of food consumption and on the basis of mortality
 Some definitions of famine are: kisi aabaadi main khaadya padaarthon kii kami yaa to bhojan kii kami yaa phir bhojan ke vitaran main kathinaaiyon ke kaaran hota he; yah sthiti prakritik jalwaayu ke utaar-chadhaavon or damankaaree sarkaar yaa yuddh se sambandhit charam raajnneetik paristhitiyon ke kaaran or bhi badtar ho sakati he
 Ireland's horrific famine was proportionally one of the largest historical famines
 isaki shuruyaat 1845 main aalu kii beemaari kii vajah se hui thi or yah isliye bhi hua kyonki khaadya padaarthon ko ireland se england bheja ja rahaa tha
 Only the British were able to pay the higher prices
 haal hi main itihaaskaaron ne apane un aakalnon ko sanshodhit kiya he jiske anusaar yah bataaya gaya tha ki akaal ko kam karne main angrejon dwaara kitna adhik niyantran kaa prayaas kiya ja saktaa tha, isamen yah paaya gaya ki aam taur par jitna samajha jaataa tha unhone usase kahin adhik madad karne kii koshish kii thi
 The traditional explanation for the cause of famine until 1981 was as a hypothesis of decreased availability of food
 dharna yah thi ki sabhi akalon kii kendriya vajah khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta main kami thi
 However the FAD could not explain why only a particular segment of the population such as agricultural laborers were affected by famine while others were untouched by famine
 haal hi ke kuch akalon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par ebedy kii nirnaayak bhoomika par sawaal uthaaya gaya he or yah suzav diya gaya he ki jald se jald bhukhmaree kii sthiti laane kaa kaaran banane vaali pranaaliyon main sirf khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta main kami ke alaava bhi kai anya kaarak shaamil hai
 According to this view, famine is a consequence of rights, this proposed principle is called "failure of exchange rights" or FEE
 kisi vyakti ke paas vibhinn prakaar kii vasteen ho sakati hai jinaki adla-badali ek bazaar vyavastha main uski jarurat kii anya chizon ke badalen main kii ja sakati he
 Exchange can be done through trade or production or a combination of both
 in adhikaron ko vyapaar-aadhaarit yaa utpaadan-aadhaarit adhikaar kaha jaataa he
 According to this proposed approach, the state of famine comes due to the loss of ability of the person to exchange his rights
 epaii ke kaaran hone vaale akalon kaa ek udhaaharan kisi khetihar majdoor dwaara apane pramukh adhikaron kaa aadan-pradaan karne kii aakshamata he, jaise ki chaaval kaa majdoor jab uske rojgaar kii sthiti dawandol yaa puri tarah se samaapt ho jaati he
 Some elements make a particular area highly susceptible to famine
 inamen shaamil hai: In some cases, such as the Great Leap Forward in China, in North Korea in the mid-1990s or in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, famine conditions may arise as an unintended consequence of government policies

 The famine in Somalia came due to a failed administration
 kai akaal badi aabaadi vaale deshon kii tulana main, jinaki aabaadi kshetreey vahan kshamta se adhik ho jaati he, khaadya utpaadan main asantulan ke kaaran paidaa hote hai
 Historically, famine has been caused by agricultural problems such as drought, crop failure or epidemic
 mausam ke badalte mizaaj, sankat, yuddh or mahamari janit bimariyon jaise ki kaali maut se nibatane main madhya yugin sarkaron kii aprabhavashiltaa madhya yugon ke dauraan europe main saikadon akalon ko janm dene main sahaayak siddh hui jinamein britain main 95 or france main 75 akaal shaamil hai
 a hundred years of war, crop failures and epidemics in France had reduced its population by two-thirds

 Famine is often associated with subsistence agriculture
 ek aarthik rup se majboot kshetra main krishi kaa kul abhaav akaal kaa kaaran nahin banataa he; erizona or anya samrudh kshetra apane khaadya padaarth ke bahut adhik hisse kaa aayaat karte hai, kyonki is tarah ke kshetra vyapaar ke liye paryaapt aarthik samagriyon kaa utpaadan karte hai
 The famine situation has also arisen due to volcanic event
 1885 main indonesia main mount tambora jwalamukhi main visphot ke kaaran duniya bhar main fasal nasht ho gaye the or akaal kii sthitiyaan paidaa ho gayi thim jiske kaaran 19veen sadi kaa bheeshan akaal padaa tha
 The current consensus of the scientific community is that aerosols and dust emanating in the upper atmosphere cool the temperature by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground

 sensor ek aisa upkaran he jo kisi bhautik raashi ko maapne kaa kaary karata he tathaa ise ek aise sanket main parivartit kar detaa he jise kisi paryvekshak yaa yantra dwaara padhaa ja saktaa he
 For example, a mercury-filled glass thermometer converts the measured temperature to the expansion and contraction of a fluid that can be read on a calibrated glass tube
 ek thermokapal taapmaana ko ek output voltage main parivartit kar detaa he jise ek voltmetre dwaara padhaa ja saktaa he
 In terms of accuracy, all sensors need to be calibrated to known standards
 sensoron kaa upyog rosemara kii vastuon main kiya jaataa he
 Such as - touch-sensitive lift buttons and lamps whose touch to the ground floor makes it dim or fast
 in sensoron ke or bhi anginat anuprayog hai jiske bare main adhikansh log abhi tak parichit nahin hai
 These applications include carts, machines, space technology, medicine, manufacturing and robotics
 ek sensor kii samvedansheeltaa yah suchit karti he ki maapit raashi ke badalane par sensor kaa output kitni baar badalata he
 For example, if the mercury of a thermometer is 1 cm liquefied as a result of a change of 1 ° c in temperature, its sensitivity is 1 cm / ° C
 jo sensor bahut chote parivartanon ko maapte hai, unamem bahut ucch koti kii samvedansheeltaa honi chahie
 The sensors also impact the way they measure; For example, a thermometer used to measure room temperature is cooled by pouring it into a cup filled with a hot fluid while the thermometer is heated by that fluid
 sensoron kii banaavat aisi honi chahie ki un par kam prabhaav pade jis par maapne kaa kaary kiya jaataa he
 This often improves with the shortening of the sensor and other benefits can also come from it
 praudyogic pragati MEMS praudyogiki prayukt microcenseron ke rup main sookshmdarsheey str par adhik se adhik sensoron ke utpaadan ko niyat karata he
 In most cases, a microsensor reaches significantly higher speeds and sensitivity than elliptical approaches
 ek acha sensor nimnlikhit niyamon kaa anusaran karata he: The design of ideal sensors is linear
 aise kisi sensor kaa output sanket maapit gundharm visheshta ke maan ke raikhik rup se samaanupatik hota he
 The sensitivity is then defined as the ratio of the output signal and the measured property characteristic
 udhaahranswaroop, yadi ek sensor taapmaana maapne kaa kaary karata he or iskaa ek voltage output he to samvedansheeltaa ek sthiraank hoti he jisaki ikai he; yah sensor raikhik hota he kyonki sabhi maapan binduon par anupaat sthir hota he
 If the sensor is not ideal then several types of interference can be seen: in sabhi vyutkramon ko paddatibaddh trutiyon yaa kramarahit trutiyon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Methodological errors can sometimes be compensated through some type of calibration policy
 shor ek kramarahit truti he, jaise nispandan, jise sanket prakriya dwaara saadharantaya sensor ke gatyaatmak gatividhi kii keemat par kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change that it detects in the amount being measured
 praayah kisi ankiy pradarshan main sabase kam mahatvapurn ank main utaar-chadhaav hoga jo yah suchit karata he ki keval us pariman ke parivartan main hi vibhedan hua he
 Differentiation is related to the accuracy with which measurement is performed
 udhaahranswaroop, ek scanning tanneling jaanch parmaanuon or anuon main vibhedan kar saktaa he
 Biological sensors are found in all living organisms whose implementation is similar to the mechanical devices described
 inamen se adhikansh aisi vishisht koshikaayen hai jo nimna ke prati samvedansheel hai: Artificial sensors that mimic biological sensors using biological sensitive components are called biosensors

 In the late 1930s, Swiss physicist Walter Jagger tried to invent a sensor for toxic gas
 He hoped that the gas entering the sensor would be bound to ionized air molecules and for that reason would change the electric current in the circuit of the device
 Their device failed: small concentrations of gas had no effect on the conductivity of the sensor
 Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette — and they were soon surprised to see that a meter of the instrument had informed the current

 Most air-sampling smoke detection systems are capable of much higher sensitivity than spot type smoke detectors and provide varying levels of alarm range, such as alert, action, fire 1 and fire 2
 dhuon ke vyapak staron main chaaron ore staron main simaaen nirdhaarit kii ja sakati hai
 It gives earlier notice of a fire evolving compared to a spot type smoke detection system, allowing manual intervention or automatic mitigation systems to be activated before the fire develops beyond the smoldering phase
 Increases the time available to evacuate and minimizes the damage caused by fire
 dahan ke atyadhik khatarnaak utpaadon kaa pataa lagane ke liye kuch dhune vaale alarm carbon dioxide sensor yaa carbon monooxide sensor kaa prayog karte hai
 However, all smoke detection detectors that are propagated with such gas sensors are actually capable of warning toxic levels of those gases in the absence of fire

 The high concentration of smoke results in blurring levels and decreases visibility
 vyavsaayik dhumrapaan detector yaa to paaramparik yaa analog adreciable hote hai or unka suraksha nigaraanee pranaaliyon yaa aag alarm niyantran panelon se vidyut sangyojan hota he
 These are the most common type of detector and usually cost much more than household smoke alarms
 ve atyant vyavsaayik evam audyogic suvidhaon jaise ki oonchi imaaraton, jahaajon or gadiyon main maujuud rahete hai
 These detectors do not require built-in, since alarm systems can be controlled by interconnected FACP and can also perform complex tasks such as systematically emptying
 paaramparik shabd ek slang he jiskaa prayog niyantran ikai ke saath sampark karne ke liye upyog kiye jane vaale tareeke or adreciable detectaron ke dwaara shuruyaat ke samay upyog kiye jane vaale apaaramparik tareekon ke bich antar bataane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The so-called "conventional detectors" cannot be individually identified by the control unit and are similar to an electrical switch in its information capability
 ye detector samanaantar rup se sanketan path yaa aarambh karne vaale upkaran paripath se jude rahete hai taaki dhuaan yaa anya samaan paryaavaran sambandhi prerak vastu dwaara kisi detector ko bahut adhik prabhavit karne ke samay kisi sanyojit detector dwaara paripath path kii bandi ko suchit karne ke liye dhara ke pravaah kii nigaraanee kii ja sake

 This type of installation gives each detector included in a system an individual number or address
 is prakaar, adreciable detector ek FACP dwaara aag bujhane vaale vyaktiyon ko ek aarekh par ingit alarm kii bilkul sahi sthiti kii jaankaree praapt karne main sakasham banaate hai
 Analog addressable detectors provide information about the amount of smoke in their detection area, so that facps themselves can decide whether there is an alarm condition in that area
 These typically compare autonomously judged detectors Are more expensive
