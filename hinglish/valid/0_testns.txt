 Such as the fingerprints of the offender at the scene, the impression of his foot, the dirt on the shoes, or the objects found at the scene with the clothes of the offender

 There are three different types of explosions
 sabase acchhee tarah se manaaya jaataa he megmatic visphot, jisamen megma ke bheetar gas kaa diconpressant shaamil hota he jo ise aage badhaata he
 Phreatomagmatic eruption is another type of volcanic eruption, which is induced by compression of gas within the magma, directing magmatic activity in direct contrast to the process
 teesraa visphotak prakaar agni visphot he, jo megma ke sampark ke madhyam se bhaap ke ati taap dwaara sanchalit hota he; in visphotak prakaar aksar maujuuda rock ke dane ke kaaran, koi bhi megmatic relies pradarshit nahin karte hai
 There are several subtypes within these broadly defined explosive types
 sabase kamjor hawaiyan or pandubbi hai, phir stromboliyan, iske baad valkanian or suratsian
 Strong explosive types are pellen explosions, followed by Plinian explosions; The strongest explosions are called "ultra-plinian"
 Subglacial or phreatic visphot unke visphotak tantra dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he, or takat main bhinnata he
 An important measure of explosive strength is the Volcanic Explosive Index, an order of magnitude scale from 0 to 8 that is often related to explosive types
 visphotak kii takat ko maapne ke liye jwalamukheey visphot suchakank 0 se 8 tak scale hota he
 It is used by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program in assessing the impact of historical and prehistoric lava flows
 yah bukamp ke liye richter scale ke samaan tareeke se sanchalit hota he, jisamen mulya main prayek antaraal pariman main das guna badhata he 
 The vast majority of volcanic eruptions are between 0 and 2 VEI
 megmatic visphot gas relies se visphotak diconpressant ke dauraan kishor samoohon kaa utpaadan karte hai
 They can range in size from relatively small lava to over 30 km high ultra-plinian eruption, larger than the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 burying Pompeii
 hawaiyan visphot jwalamukheey visphot kaa ek prakaar he, jiskaa naam hawaii jwalamukhi ke naam par rakhaa gaya he jiske saath yah visphotak naam ek prakaar hollmark he
 Hawaiian eruptions are the quietest type of volcanic event, characterized by an impressive eruption of very fluid basalt-type lava, with low gaseous content
 hawaiyan visphot se nikali saamagree kii maatra anya jwalamukhi prakaaron main nikali maatra se aadhe se kam he
 The production of stable amounts of lava produces a wide gradient and large volcanic mountain
 visphotak mukhya shikhar sthaan par kendrit nahin rahete, jaisaa ki anya jwalamukheey prakaaron ke saath hote hai, or aksar shikhar ke aas paas or centre se baahar nikalne vaale fisher vents se hote hai
 Hawaiian explosions often begin as a line, often known as a fire curtain, along the fisher vent
 These lavas begin to concentrate on some vents, vents
 mukh dwaar is bich, aksar bade lava fawwaare kaa rup lete hai, jo saikadon meter yaa usase adhik kii oonchaaiyon tak pahunch sakate hai
 Particles from lava fountains are usually cooled in the air before falling to the ground, resulting in the accumulation of fragments of cindery scoria; However, when the air is particularly thick with explosions, they cannot cool quickly enough due to the surrounding heat, and can still heat the ground, creating an accumulation cone
 yadi visphotak dar kaaphi adhik hai, to ve spatter-fed lava pravaah bhi bana sakate hai
 Hawaiian explosions often last very long; Puu'ao, a cinder cone of Kilauea, has been exploding continuously since 1983

 If any one of these factors is reduced too much, then malaria can be eradicated from that area
 isiliye malaria prabhavit kshetron main rog kaa prasar rokane hetu dawaaon ke saath-saath machharon kaa unmoolan yaa unase kaatane se bachane ke upaay kiye jate hai
 Many researchers claim that the cost of prevention against malaria treatment will be lower in the long run, although some of the world's poorest countries do not have the ability to bear the immediate expenditure
 aarthik salaahkaar jaifari sex ke anusaar prativarsh 3 arab america dollars kii sahaayta dekar malaria kaa prasar roka ja saktaa he
 At the same time, it is argued that African countries will benefit more if funds are diverted to AIDS treatment to meet the Millennium Development Goals

 But they could not succeed and malaria is still present in Africa at the same level
 jabaki brazil, iritria, bharat or vietnam jaise kuch vikasshil desh he jinhone is rog par kaaphi had tak kaabo paa liya he
 The reasons behind this are considered - use of effective tools, better leadership of the government, community participation, decentralized implementation, getting skilled technical-manager workers, correct technical support by partner institutions and adequate funding
 machharon ke prajnan sthalon ko nasht karke malaria par bahut niyantran paaya ja saktaa he
 Mosquitoes breed in standing water, such standing water spaces should be covered, dried or drained or oil should be applied on the surface of the water, so that the mosquito larvae cannot breathe
 malaria unmoolan ke jo prayaas purnatah safal rahe hai unamem machharon ke unmoolan kaa pramukh sthaan tha
 The disease was once common in the United States and South Europe, but it was eradicated from these areas by drying the marshy areas of mosquito breeding sites, keeping a close watch on patients and promptly treating them with better drainage

 In addition to these, mosquitoes converted to genetic techniques are being created which will not allow the malaria parasite to thrive
 aise machharon ko khulaa chhod dene par dhire-dhire inaki pratiraksha kii jin machharon kii sari aabaadi main fail jaaegi
 In malaria-affected areas, insecticides are often sprayed on the walls of homes
 anek prajatiyon ke machhar manushya kaa khun chusane ke baad diwaar par baith kar ise hajam karte hai
 In such a situation, if insecticides are sprayed on the walls, the mosquito will die as soon as it sits on the wall, before any other humans are bitten
 dediti pehla aadhunik kitnashak tha jo malaria ke viruddh prayog kiya gaya tha, kintu baad main yani 1950 ke baad ise krishi kitnashi rup main prayog karne lage the

 1960 ke dashak main iske hanikaarak prabhaav najar aane lage or 1970 ke dashak main anek deshon main iske prayog par roak laga di gayi
 Prohibiting the use of this medicine is considered quite controversial
 vaise ise malaria niyantran hetu kabhi pratibandhit nahin kiya gaya, kintu aalochak kehete he ki anaavashyak lagi roak se lakhon logon ke praan gaye hai
 Then the problem was caused by the widespread use of DDT in the agricultural sector and not by using it in the public health sector
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne malaria prabhavit kshetron main chhidkav ke liye lagbhag 12 dawaaon ko manyata di he
 These include drugs such as permethrin and deltamethrin in addition to DDT, especially in areas where mosquitoes have developed immunity to DDT

 Recently a fungus has been discovered which causes a deadly disease in mosquitoes and by spraying on its walls can get rid of mosquitoes

 Mosquito nets are successful in keeping mosquitoes away from people and prevent malaria infection to a great extent
 anopheles machhar chunki raat ko katata he isliye badi machharadaani ko charpai / bistar pe lataka dene tathaa iske dwaara bistar ko chaaron taraf se purnatah gher dene se suraksha puri ho jaati he
 Mosquito nets are not very effective measures in their own right, but if treated chemically, they become very useful
 is rasayan ke sampark main aate hi machhar mar jate he
 Treated mosquito nets are twice as effective than untreated mosquito nets, and using them instead of sleeping without mosquito nets provides 70% more protection

 Nowadays, this kind of mosquito net is being made by new technology which has insecticidal effect for five years
 in machharadaani ke andar sone par to suraksha milti hi he jo machhar inke sampark main aate he ve bhi turant mar jate he jisase aas-paas soe anya logon ko bhi kuch suraksha mil jaati he
 Recent experiments have shown that even bed-covered and muffled sheets are treated with drugs that provide mosquito net protection
 anek davaayen aamtaur par jinka upyog upachaar main hota he unka prayog nirodhak prabhaav hetu bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The amount of drugs for the anticonvulsant effect is less than the treatment
 kintu inke deergh kaal prayog se haani hoti he, isliye mahamari kshetron main ye kam hi prayog main laai jaati hai yaa milti hi nahin hai
 Yes, if you are going to a fever affected area temporarily then you can use them

 Samuel Hahnemann invented the theory of homeopathy in the 18th century by looking at the influence of Quinine

 Before choosing the medicine one should have knowledge of the immunity of the active parasite to the drug

 It does not start to take effect as soon as it is used, it takes at least 1-2 weeks, and has to be taken for some time after leaving the malaria-prone area
 malaria ke viruddh tike viksit kiye ja rahe he yadhyapi abhi tak safalataa nahin mili he
 The first attempt was made in 1967 on rats that were vaccinated with living but radiation-treated spores
 isaki safalataa dar 60% thi
 Since then efforts are being made to carry out such experiments on humans

 This notion is currently under work and many types of vaccines are in different stages of testing
 ek anya soch is disha main he ki sharir kaa pratirodhi tantra kisi prakaar malaria paraseete ke bijaanu par maujuud siespi ke viruddh antibody banane lage
 Most vaccines have been made and tested so far on this thinking

 Malaria-affected areas have seen a 20 percent reduction in malaria by spreading awareness about malaria
 saath hi malaria kaa nidaan or ilaaj jald se jald karne se bhi iske prasar main kami hoti he
 Other efforts include collecting and analyzing malaria on a large scale and examining how effective the methods of malaria control are
 aise ek vishleshan main pataa laga ki lakshan-viheen sankraman vaale logon kaa ilaaj karnaa bahut aavashyak hota he, kyonki inamen bahut maatra main malaria sanchit rahata he
 The Lahore Preamble was an official political concept proposed by the All India Muslim League in 1940, which was passed during the three-day Lahore session of the Muslim League from 22 to 24 March 1940

 Subsequently, this concept was changed to demand a separate independent autonomous country called Pakistan for the "muslims of India"
 haalanki pakistan naam ko choudhary choudhary rahamat ali dwaara pehle hi prastaavit kar diya gaya tha parantu san 1933 tak majaloom haq mohammad ali jinna evam anya musalmaan netaa hindu muslim ekta ke siddhant par drudh the, parantu angrejon dwaara lagaataar prachaarit kiye ja rahe vibhaajan protsaah galatchhemiyon main hinduon main musalamaanon ke prati avishvaas or dwesh kii bhaavana ko jagaa diya tha in paristhitiyon dwaara khadey hue atisamvedansheel rajnatik maahaul ne bhi pakistan banane ke us prastaav ko badhaava diya tha To commemorate the presentation of this motion, 23 March is celebrated annually in Pakistan as yom-e-pakistan

 The first general elections were held in 1936 / 1937 in the first phase of the process of handing over power to the public by the British Raj in the subcontinent, the Muslim League had to be defeated badly and its claim that it was severely demoralized by the Muslims of the subcontinent
 The only representative is the House

 The Congress had a clear majority in Madras, U

 The Muslim League could not gain power in any of the 11 provinces of India
 in paristhitiyon main muslim lig aisa lagata tha, upmahadweep ke raajnneetik dhara se alag hoti ja rahi he
 During this period, the Congress, which for the first time had drunk too much of power, took such measures that fear and threats started taking birth in the hearts of the Muslims
 jaise congress ne hindi ko rashtrabhasha ghoshit kar diya, gaao kshay par pabandi laga di or congress ke tirange ko rashtriya dhvaj kaa darja diya
 With the Muslim League losing power in this case, there was a feeling under its leadership that the Muslim League was deprived of power on the grounds that it called itself the House of Representatives of Muslims
 yahi prarambh bindu tha muslim lig ke netritv main do alag rashtron kii bhaavana jaagrukta ki
 At the same time, the discussion between the British Raj and the Congress on the issue of full transfer of power in return for World War II support broke out and when the Congress split from power, some doors were opened for the Muslim League
 or isi prishthbhumi main lahore main ol india muslim lig 'kaa yah 3 divasiy baithak 22 march ko shuru hua
 4 days before the meeting, the Din Party of Allama Eastern in Lahore broke a ban and held a military parade, which the police opened fire to prevent
 35 ke kareeb deen maare gaye
 Due to this incident, there was tremendous tension in Lahore and in Punjab, the Muslim League's ally, the Uniunsat Party was in power and there was a danger that the shin carrier workers of Deen should not allow this meeting of the Muslim League or there is an uproar on this occasion 
 sanyog hi gambhirtha ke maddenjar mohammad ali jinna ne udghaatan satr ko sambodhit kiya jisamen unhone pehali baar kaha ki bharat main samasya sampradayik raarna tarah kaa nahin he balki ben international he yani yah do deshon kii samasya he
 He said that the difference between Hindus and Muslims is so big and clear that their alliance under a central government will be full of dangers
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main ek hi rasta he ki unhen alag mamalakatein hoon
 On the same day, on 23 March, the then Chief Minister of Bengal, Maulvi Kripa Haq, gave a resolution in Lahore, stating that no constitutional scheme would be feasible nor would Muslims have until the geographical units met each other
 Separate singing areas should not be limited
 sankalp main kaha gaya tha ki in kshetron main jahaan musalamaanon kii sankhyatmak bahumat he jaise ki bharat ke uttar pashchimi or purvottar kshetra, unhen sangyojan unhen mukt mamalakatein sthapit kii jaaen jinamein shaamil ikaayiyon ko swaittata or samprabhutaa ucch mil
 The resolution offered by Maulvi Inam-ul was supported by the Muslim Legion leader of UP, Chaudhary Riyalsam, Punjab, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, Sardar Aurangzeb Sindh from the border, Abdullah Haroon from Sindh and Qazi Isa from Balochistan
 sankalp 23 march ko samaapan satr main paarit kiya gaya
 In April 1941, at the conference of the Muslim League in Madras, the resolution Lahore was included in the party's constitution and it was on this basis that the Pakistan movement started
 lekin phir bhi in kshetron kii spasht pahchaan nahin kii gai thi, jinamein shaamil alag muslim rajyon kii maang kiya ja rahaa tha
 For the first time, areas for Pakistan's demand were identified on 7 April 1946 in a three-day conference in Delhi attended by Muslim Legion members of the Central and Provincial Legislative Assemblies
 is sammelan main britain se aane vaale cabinet mishan ke pratinidhimandal ke saamne muslim lig kii maang pesh karne ke liye ek prastaav paarit kiya gaya tha jiskaa masauda muslim lig kii kaaryakarini ke do sadasyon choudhary riek lsamaan or hasan isohani ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The areas to be included in Pakistan were clearly identified in this Karadad
 purvottar main bengal or assam or uttar pashchim main punjab, seemaa, sindh or baluchistan
 Surprisingly, there was no mention of Kashmir in this resolution although there was a Muslim dominated area in the North West and annexed to Punjab
 yah baat behad mahatvapurn he ki dilli kanvension is sankalp main do rajyon kaa ullekh bilkul hataa diya gaya tha jo sankalp lahore main bahut spasht rup se tha uski jagah pakistan kii ekmaatr rajya kii maang kii gai thi
 Perhaps few people know that the original draft of Sankalp Lahore was prepared by Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, the then UNIANSUT Chief Minister of Punjab
 uninst party us jamaane main muslim lig main ekikrut ho gai thi or sir sikandar hayaat khan punjab muslim lig ke adhyaksh the
 In the original draft resolution, the head Sikandar Hayat Khan proposed almost a central government on the basis of a central government in the subcontinent, but when the draft was considered in the Muslim League Subject Committee, quaid-e-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah himself mentioned the only central government in this draft
 chopped off
 sir sikandar hayaat khan is baat par sakht naaraaz the or unhone 11 march san 1941 ko punjab vidhansabha main saaf-saaf kaha tha ki unka pakistan kaa najariya jinna sahab ke siddhant mukhya rup se alag he
 He said that he was strongly opposed to the distribution on the basis of Hindu Raj on the one hand and Muslim Raj on the other hand in India and he would fight against their destructive distribution in such a manner
 magar aisa nahin hua
 Sir Sikander Hayat Khan died the second year in 1942, at the age of 50, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah got freedom from Hisar in Punjab due to intense opposition
 san 1946 ke dilli adhiveshan main pakistan kii maang sankalp hossain shahid soharavardi ne pesh kii or upi ke muslim legi netaa choudhary riek lsamaan ne isaki tayad kii thi
 Maulvi Kripa Haq, who presented the resolution Lahore, did not attend the conference as he was dismissed from the Muslim League in 1941
 dilli sammelan main bengal ke netaa abu alhashm ne is sankalp par jor virodh kiya or yah tark diya he ki is sankalp lahore sankalp se kaaphi alag he jo muslim lig ke samvidhan kaa hissaa he- unka kahana tha ki sankalp lahore main spasht rup se do rajyon ke gathan kii maang kii gai thi isliye dilli kanvension ko muslim lig kii is buniyadi sankalp main sanshodhan kaa katai koi vikalp nahin- According to Abvalhashm, quaid-e-azam had explained in this conference and later in a meeting in Bombay that after this time there is talk of formation of two separate Constituent Legislatures in the subcontinent, then a state is mentioned in the Delhi Convention Resolution
 
 lekin jab pakistan kii samvidhan sabha samvidhan set karegi to vah is samasya ke antim madhyasth hogi or yah do alag rajyon ke gathan ke faisle kaa puraa adhikaar hoga
 But the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan did not consider the establishment of two independent and autonomous states of Muslims in the subcontinent neither in quaid-e-azam life nor when the country's first constitution was passed in 1956
 25 saal kii raajnneetik uthal-puthal or sangharsh or sun 1971 main bangladesh yuddh ke vinaash ke baad lekin upmahadweep main musalamaanon kii do alag mamalakatein ubharin jinka maang sankalp lahore ke maamle main aaj bhi surakshit he

 Caleb was furious and with the encouragement of King Justin i of the Byzantine Sultanate, he attacked Yemen and annexed it into his kingdom

 Personality disorders are classified under ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders, especially under mental and behavioral disorders: 28F60-F69
29 Adult personality and behavior disorders
 adarsh rup se vyaktitv vikaar ke vibhinn swarup kisi vyakti kii vyavhaar sambandhi pravritiyon kii gambhir samasyaon se sambhddha hote hai, jo aamtaur par vyaktitv ke anekon pahaluon ko shaamil karte hai or lagbhag hameshaa hi kaaphi had tak nijee or saamaajik vidaaran se jude hote hai
 In addition, in many situations, personality disorder is inflexible and widespread, which is largely due to the self-conformity of such behavior and therefore the person considers it appropriate
 is prakaar ke vyavhaar ke falswaroop sambandhit vyakti saamanjasy sthapit ko hatotsahit karne karne kaa doshapurn kaushal grahan karne lagata he jo un nijee samasyaon kaa kaaran ban saktaa he jinase sambandhit vyakti atyadhik chintaa, bechaini or avsaad kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 The onset of these behavioral trends can be seen ideally from the later stages of adolescence to the onset of adulthood and in some unusual cases in childhood
 isliye yah asambhav hi he ki vyaktitv vikaar kaa nidaan 16 yaa 17 saal kii umr se pehle karwaanaa uchit hoga
 The general diagnostic instructions that apply to all types of personality disorders are given below, supplementary descriptions for these are given with each subtype

 Inflexible and unending trends of perception, thought and behavior are thought to be caused by a basic belief system and these systems are referred to as permanent fantasies or "dysfunctional ischemata"
 dsam IV exis II main, 10 prakaar ke vyaktitv vikaron ko 3 sanghon ke samooh main anusuchit karata he
 DSM also has a category for behavioral trends that do not fall under these 10 disorders but still manifest symptoms of personality disorder

 Appendix b covers the following disorders

 According to ICD-10, the diagnosis of personality disorder must be such that it satisfies the following general criteria in addition to the specific criteria prescribed under specific personality disorders: vyaktitv vikaar kii shuruaati avasthaaon yaa praarambhik praaroop ko ek bahu-aiami or sheeghra kaary karne vaali paddati kii aavashyaktaa he
