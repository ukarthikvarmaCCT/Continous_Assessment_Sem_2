 Science is clear from the monk's earlier discourses that he considers Sankhya Shastra as Vedanusari
 unka spasht mat he ki "akodwitiyah" ityadi veda vachanon ke arth kaa hi vah sad yuktiyon evam tarkon dwaara samarthan karata he, uskaa pratipaadan or vivechan karke use bodhgamy banaata he
 Vigyanbhuk has actually expressed his aforesaid opinion by following the earlier tradition prevalent in folk
 atyant pracheen kaal se hi mahabharat, gita, ramayana, smritiyon tathaa puraanon main sarvatra sankhya kaa na keval ucch gyaan ke rup main ullekh bhar hua he, apitu uske siddhanton kaa yatra-tatra vistrut vivaran bhi hua he
 In the Gita too, the trinitarian principle of Sankhya philosophy has been adopted very beautifully
 "trigunatmika prakruti nity parinamini he
 His three qualities always produce some or the other result, man is a non-believer "- this principle of Samkhya has become an essential part of Gita's Nishkam Karmayoga
 isi prakaar anyatra bhi sankhya darshan ke anek siddhant anya darshanon ke siddhanton ke poorak rup se pracheen sanskrit vadmay main drushtigochar hote hai
 From all these things, it seems that this philosophy has been Vedic in its origin, not impersonal, because if the truth were contrary to this, Vedaprana would not have given the above mentioned area for so much propagation of Samkhya in this country
 is anishvarwad, prakruti purush dwaitvaad, parinamwad aadi tathakthith veda viruddh siddhanton ke kaaran vedabaahya kahkar iskaa khandan karne vaale vedant bhashyakaar shankaracharya ko bhi brahmasutra 2
1
3 ke bhashya main likhnaa hi padaa ki "aadhyaatmavishyak anek smritiyon ke hone par bhi sankhya yoga smritiyon ke hi niraakaran main praytn kiya gaya
 Because both of them are famous as the means of ultimate effort in the world, are acclaimed by the saintly great men and consist of "linga", "tatkaranam Sankhya Yogabhishannam Gyatva Deva and Muchyatee Sarvapashai: Ya, etc
 " swayan bhashyakaar ke apane sakshya se bhi spasht he ki unke purvavarti sutarakaar ke samay main bhi anek shisht purush sankhya darshan ko vaidic darshan maanate the tathaa param purusharth kaa saadhan maanakar uskaa anusaran karte the
 Based on all these facts, it is expedient to consider Sankhya philosophy as Vedic
 haan, apane parvarti vikaas main yah avashya hi kuch moolbhoot siddhanton main veda viruddh ho gaya he jaise uttarvarti sankhya vaidic parampara ke viruddh nirishwar he, uski prakruti swatantra rup se swat: samast vishwa kii sristi karti he
 But the origin of this philosophy is found in the oldest Chandogya and Vrhadaranyaka Upanishads
 isi se isaki pracheenta suspasht he
 Only two fundamental texts of this philosophy are available today - the first "samkhya-discourse-sutra" with six chapters and the second "samkhikarika" with seventy kariks
 in do ke atirikt ek atyant laghukaay sutaragranth bhi he jo "tatv samaas" ke naam se prasiddh he
 The rest of the Samkhya Vadmaya is only the commentary and epitope of these three
 inamen sankhya sutron ke upadeshta parampara se kapil muni maane jate hai
 Scholars do not consider the Sankhya-discourse-sutras available for many reasons to be Kapilized
 itani baat avashya hi nishchit he ki in sutron ko kapilopdisht maanane par bhi iske anek sthalon ko swayan sutron ke hi ant:-sakshya ke bal par prakshipt maananaa padegaa
 The numerals are composed by Ishvakrishna, whose time is considered by the majority to be the middle of the third century AD
 vastut: inkaa samay isse paryaapt purv kaa prathit hota he
 There is no scripture of Kapuri's disciple, Asuri, but his famous disciple Acharya Panchshikh, in the form of many sutras quoted in ancient texts like Vyasarit Yogabhasya, etc
, it seems clear that any sutra script by him was famous in ancient times
 anek vidwaanon ke mat se yah prasiddh granth shashthitantr hi tha
 By the opinion of Udayveer Shastri, the conspiracy-related Sankhya-discourse-sutra available in the present times was also known as "shashtitantra" due to the representation of shasthi substances
 unke mat se sambhavat: kapil muni ke prashishy panchashikhacharya ne us par vyakhya likhi thi or vah bhi mulgranth ke hi naam par shashthitantr kahi jaati thi
 According to the opinion of some scholars, "shashthi Tantra" is written of the famous numerical annuity
 jaigishadhya, deval, asit ityadi anya anek pracheen sankhyacharyon ke vishay main aaj kuch vishesh gyaan nahin he
 Tsar or Tsar is the word for emperor or king in Russia and many other Slavic cultures
 raniyon or maharaniyon ko tsarina yaa tsarina kaha jaataa he
 Even in the Russian Empire, the Maharaja was known only by the title of 'tsar'
 yah mul rup se latini bhashaa ke 'seizar' shabd se utpann hua he
 Varhadi is a dialect of Marathi

 Template: Hindu philosophy Manvantar, according to Hinduism, is the age of the progenitor of humanity
 yah samay maapan kii khagoleey avadhi he
 Manvantara is a Sanskrit word, whose = manu + difference is found on disjuncture
 iskaa arth he manu kii aayu
 Each Manvantara is composed and governed by a particular Manu, who is blessed by Brahma
 manu vishwa kii or sabhi praaniyon kii utpatti karte hai, jo ki unki aayu kii avadhi tak banati or chalati rahati hai, 
 un manu kii matyu ke uparaant brahma fir ek naye manu kii sristi karte hai, jo ki fir se sabhi sristi karte hai
 Along with this, Vishnu also takes the Avatar from time to time, according to its structure and follows it
 inke saath hi ek naye indra or saptarshi bhi niyukt hote hai
 a kalpa is formed by mixing fourteen manu and their manvantara
 yah brahma kaa ek diwas hota he
 It is based on Hindu time cycle and Vedic timeline
 prayek kalp ke ant main pralay aati he, jisamen brahmand kaa sanhaar hota he or vah viraam kii sthiti main aa jaataa he, jis kaal ko brahma kii raatri kehete hai
 After this the creator Brahma starts the creation again, after which the destroyer, Lord Shiva, destroys it
 or yah sab ek antaheen prakriya yaa chakra main hota rahata he
 
 sristi ki kul aayu : 429408 xxrep 4 0 varshaise kul 14 manvantaron me baanta gaya he
 Currently 7th Manvantar i
e
 Vaivaswat Manu is going on
 Before this, 6 manvantaras like Swayambhava, Swarochish, Auttami, Tamas, Raivat, Chakshus have passed, and 7 Savarnas etc
 will be consumed further
 1 manvantar = 71 chaturyugi1 chaturyugi = chaar yug Age of the four Yugas: - Satyuga = 1728000 years Treta Yuga = 1296000 years Dwaparyuga = 864000 years and Kaliyuga = 432000 years Thus total age of 1 Chaturyugi = 1728000 + 1296000 + 864000 + 432000 = 432 xxrep 4 0 years
 1 manvantar = 71 × 432 xxrep 4 0 = 30672 xxrep 4 0 varshachunki ese - ese 6 manvantar biit chuke he 
 isliye 6 manvantar kii kul aayu = 6 × 30672 xxrep 4 0 = 184032 xxrep 4 0 varshavartmaan me 7 wein manvantar ke bhoga me yah 28veen chaturyugi he
 is 28veen chaturyugi me 3 yug arthath satyuga, tretayug, dwapar yug biit chuke he or kaliyug kaa 5115 waan varsh chal rahaa he 
27 chaturyugi kii kul aayu = 27 × 432 xxrep 4 0 = 11664 xxrep 4 0 varsh And total age of 5115 years of Satyuga, Dwapara, Tretayuga and Kali Yuga of 28th Chaturyugi = 1728000 + 1296000 + 864000 + 5115 = 3893115 years
 Thus, the total age of the present age of 28th Chaturyugi till 5115th year = Total age of 27th Chaturyugi + 3893115 = 11664 xxrep 4 0 + 3893115 = 120533115 years Thus total years that have passed = Total age of 6 Manvantara + Total age till 5115th year of Kaliyuga of 28th Chaturyugi of 7th Manvantar = 184032 xxrep 4 0 + 120533115 = 1960853115 years
 So present In 1960853115th year He is walking and has to bear the remaining 2333226885 years which is as follows 


 The remaining age of creation = Total age of creation - 1960853115 = 2333226885 years
 This calculation is based on the role of Rigvedadibhisabha composed by Maharshidayananda

 The pharaoh Akhenaten was of the 18th dynasty of Egypt

 Western scholars consider him the first monotheist in the world

 Mittani princess Taduxipa became her second queen

 After his death his new religion was suppressed
 kuch vidwaan samajhate hai ki musa ne isi ke vichaaron ko dubaara uthaanaa chaha
 If this theory is correct then it is ironic that the tradition of Akhenatan, which is considered to be the antithesis of the Jewish Christian and Islamic religions, itself is based on the tradition of its anti-sanatan religion

 Shelley obtained tartaric acid from the tartar of grapes in 1768, and in 1819, Kestner found an acid derivative of the same composition and named it racemic acid
 1838 i
 main bio ne pataa lagaaya ki tarterik amla prakaashat: sakriy he or racemic amla prakaashat: niskriy he
 After the discovery of polarized light and photoreactivity, significant progress was made by Pastor in the principles of physiology
 paister ne pataa lagaaya ki tarterik or racemic amlon kaa sanghatan tathaa unka sanrachanasutra HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH ek he, par unke bhautik gunon main bhinnata he
 Racimic acid is less soluble in water than tartaric acid, and tartaric acid and its salts are lightly active, but racemic acid and its salts are lightly inactive
 paister kii sabase vikhyath khoj racemic amla ke sodium or ammonium lavan par hui
 When this salt crystallizes at 22 degrees from water, its crystals are different from those of another racemet and have semipermeable panes

 This second type of crystal is called mirror reflection
 inako jab mishran se pruthak kiya gaya to iskaa jaleey vilyan vamavart tha
 The crystal of acid obtained from it was also in the form of mirror reflection of crystal of tartaric acid and the solution was also counterclockwise
 isliye is amla ko tarterik amla kaa doosraa rup samajha gaya
 Their crystals are asymmetric: yah paaya gaya ki keval ve hi crystal tathaa anu, jinke darpan pratibimb adhyaropit nahin hote, prakaashat: sakriy hote hai
 Such a structure is called asymmetric
 bahut se padaarth thos avasthaa main hi prakaashat: sakriy hote hai, jaise sphatik, sodium chloret aadi
 The first known, optically active substance is crystalline, whose crystals are of two types, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise
 ye donon crystal ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb hai or adhyaropit nahin hote
 Such pairs of crystals are called reflection forms
 sphatik ke galane par isaki sakriyata lupt ho jaati he
 Hence the photosynthetic activation of the crystal is due to its asymmetric crystal structure

 san 1874 main waant hof or le bal ne carbonic yogicon kii prakaashat: samavyawata ke astitv kaa samaadhaan kiya
 Want Half considered that the four valency of carbon is directed towards the four ends of a trigon and the carbon atom is located in the middle of the tetrahedral
 is siddhant ke anusaar methen ke chaaron hydrogen parmaanu samaan honge, jise bhautik or rasinic kriyaaon dwaara siddh bhi kiya gaya
 Earlier in 1858 AD, it was understood that all the four valencies of carbon are in a plane and the carbon atom is at the center of this square
 CX4 anu main carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaayen samaan hai or yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki trivim main inkaa samamit vinyas he
 Thus three arrangements may be possible - planar, pyramidal and tetrahedral
 yadi anu ekataleey ho, to yogic c a b d e ke teen rup sambhav ho sakate hai
 If the molecule is pyramidi, six forms of this compound may be possible
 yadi anu chatushfalkeey he, to yogic c a b d e ke do rup hi sambhav honge or donon ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb honge
 In fact the compound c abde is obtained only in a couple image form, which confirms tetrahedron molecule structure
 jab carbon main sanyojit chaaron samooh bhinn-bhinn hote hai, tab aise carbon ko asamamit carbon kehete hai
 Photosensitively active organic compounds must have one, or more than one, asymmetric carbon atom

 By mathematical calculation, the angle between any two valency of carbon was 109 ° 28 min
 pehle yah vichaar tha ki yah sanyojak kone sthaayee rahata he, par ab gyaat he ki sanyojaktaa kaa apane sthaan se vichlan ho saktaa he or is kaaran is kone main bhi parivartan ho saktaa he
 When all four atoms or groups associated with a carbon atom are one, this angle is certainly 109 degrees 28 minutes, as in methane, CH4, or carbon tetrachloride, ccl4
 lekin methilin chloride CH2 Cl2, main kone 112 degree paaya jaataa he, kyonki chlorine ke bade parmaanuon ke pratikarshi bal ke kaaran sanyojaktaa kone main adhik failaav sambhav he
 The main difference in isomers with an asymmetric carbon atom is in their optical activation
 donon pratibimb roopon ke ghurnan ke chihr main hi keval antar hota he
 Therefore, they are also known as antiquarianism
 lactic amla, CH3
CHOH

 These are called dectro - and levo - lactic acid
 baraabar anupaaton main donon roopon kaa mishran prakaashat: niskriy hota he, kyonki donon pratibimb roopon kaa ghurnan samaan tathaa disha vipareet hoti he
 Such molecules, homogeneous mixtures, which are externally repulsed and lightly inert, are called racemic metamorphs
 aise racemic yogicon ko r athwa dl- upsargon dwaara nideshit kiya jaataa he
 Thus a compound with an asymmetric carbon atom can be obtained in three forms

 yadhyapi isamen do sakriy carbon hai, tathaapi ve ek-duusare ko prabhaavaheen karte hai, kyonki unka ghurnan samaan or vipareet he
 This intermittent molecule is called i or meso form
 niskriy tathaa avibhedit rup un yogicon main sambhav nahin he jinamein ek hi asamamit carbon parmaanu ho
 It differs from racemic forms, which can be distinguished from their photosynthetic forms
 is prakaar kaa sabase uttam udhaaharan diahydrosxinic amla he, jisamen do samaan asamamit carbon hai or jiskaa aitihaasik drushti se bahut mahatv he
 According to the theory, it is obtained from the same mixture of forms southward, counterclockwise and meso-tartaric acid
 dakshinvart or vamavart prakaashat: prativinyasi hai tathaa meso or racemic niskriy hai
 Their structures can be shown as follows: ek jode pratirupon ke baraabar mishran ko racemic rup kehete hai
 This form can occur for the following reasons: baraabar maatra main donon pratirupon ko milaane se
 Synthesis of asymmetric compounds gives a racemic form
 ek prakaashat: sakriy yogic ko racemic rup main parivartan karne kii kriya ko rapeemikaran kehete hai
 Often the + and - forms of compounds can be inhibited by the effects of heat, light and chemical reagents
 parivartan kii kriya yogic or abhikarmakon ke upar nirbhar karti he
 Some compounds are so easy and rapid that they cannot be obtained in an active form
 kuch thode se aise yogic hai jo resimikrut nahin hote
 Differentiation is the action whereby both its reflection forms are separated by a racemic transformation
 vastav main inkaa maatraatmak pruthakkaran bahut hi kam hota he or kuch main to keval ek hi praturup kii prapti hoti he
 Some methods of differentiation are as follows: yantric pruthakkaran - paister ne us vidhi kaa pataa lagaaya jiske anusaar donon pratirupon ke crystal alag alag hote hai or ve haathon se alag kiye ja sakate hai
 Pastor gave sodium ammonium tartrate at 28 degrees Celsius
 By crystallizing, both types of crystals were separated by tongs
 is vidhi kaa upyog bada simit he
 Desiccated Crystallon by Insertion - When a crystal of a reflection form is added to an over saturated solution of a racemic mixture, it is first a crystal of the same reflection form and thus a separation of that form can occur
 jivaracinic vibhedan - kuch jeevanu yaa faphund jab kisi racemic ke tanu vilyan par ugaae jate hai, tab ye ek pratibimb rup ko duusare kii apeksha shighrata se nasht karte hai
 Thus a reflection form can be obtained after a specified time
 penicellium glukam jab racemic ammonium tarteret ke vilyan par ugaaya jaataa he, to pehle dectro rup nasht ho jaataa he or livo batch jaataa he
 Chemical Differentiation - This method is the best
 isamen racemic yogic ke pratibimb roopon ko kisi prakaashat: sakriy yogic se upachaarit karte hai, taaki ve paraspar milakar aise yogic bane jinka pruthakkaran saralata se kiya ja sake
 The salts that will be formed by treating the acidic acid with a lightly active base, some of the salts will be + acids and + bases and some salts - acids and + bases

 Selective absorption - Selective absorption of photosensitively active substances can occur by a particular optically active absorber
 anek rasayanagyon ne iske dwaara vibhedan sampann kiya he
 The clockwise and counterclockwise reflection forms were previously directed by the Dactro and Levo prefixes, respectively
 isi bhanti dectry tarterik or livo tarterik amla kaha jaataa tha
 Wanthoff has used the + and - signs to denote the configuration of asymmetric carbon
 baad main fisher ne prastaav kiya ki d or l upsargon kaa prayog unki vinyas sthiti ke liye kiya jaae or inkaa prayog ghurnan kii disha ke liye na kiya jaae
 The sign of rotation of an optically active substance can often be reversed by changes in the experimental condition, and likewise the sign of their kinetics, whose configuration is the same, can also be opposite to the direction of rotation, such as counterclockwise lactic acid salts
 And esters are clockwise and counterclockwise of lactic acid
 in sab kaarnon se vichaar kiya gaya ki prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke liye aise chihn kaa upyog kiya jaae jo sidhe vinyas kii sthiti kaa bodh karaae or yah chihn uske ghurnan disha ke chihn se swatantra ho
 Glyceraldehyde, which has an asymmetric carbon atom, is obtainable in two reflection forms and according to a voluntary determination that the clockwise form shows that the hydroxyl, -OH, carbon of the group is on the right and the hydrogen atom is on the right side
 chatushfalkeey carbon kii vyavastha ke anusaar hydrogen or hydroxil samooh prishth kii sataha se upar he tathaa -CHO or -CH2OH samooh prishth kii sataha se neeche
 This configuration of glyceraldehyde is called D

 In this way, glyceraldehyde has the full name d glyceraldehyde and l glyceraldehyde
 or isaki ghurnan disha kaa sanket karte hai
 Their aldehyde group can be converted to the next homogeneous - CHOH - CHO and will give each glyceraldehyde two forms as it has an asymmetric carbon

 Subsequently, the Sumerian state gave consent to the multi-standard Plethora to some standards
 sabhi likhit maan, ek parishuddh ikai maanak ke khandon main main hai
 The Greek root of stadios means to stand or have standing, to establish a standard
 In Mesopotamia the problem was that there were several different standards so in the time of Gudea an agreement was circulated between the various city states much like that which is presently being negotiated in Europe
 The weights and measures of Mesopotamia gradually developed with the associated city states
 The Sumerian number system uses a base 60 positional notation, and is the origin for the division of 60 for hours and angular degrees
 The Akkadian system adopts the Sumerian
 Over a period of several millennia international trade and commerce spread the idea of standards of measure based on definitions of land and property throughout the ancient near east
 International trade required the expansion of the arrangement throughout the ancient Near East as a common standard much like our metric system
 The basis of the standard was a definition of a geographic degree divided into 600 parts know as stadia which were further divided into 600 feet

 Certain factors increase the risk of disease progression in a person
 inamen shaamil hai: The WCRF panel report Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective has conclusively found evidence that alcoholic beverages increase the risk of colorectal cancer in men
 NIAAA ne report di he ki: "jaanapadik-rogavigyaan sambandhi adhyayan ne paaya he ki alcohol khapat or colorectal cancer ke bich ek chota lekin drudh khuraaq-nirbhar judaa he, yahaan tak ki jab fibre or anya aahaareey karkon kaa niyantran karne par bhi
 haalanki vrihad maatra main adhyayan ke baavjood bhi uplabdh data se karaniya ko nirdhaarit nahin kar sakate
" "consumption of alcohol in large quantities can also increase the risk of colorectal cancer"
 One study found that "people who consume more than 30 grams of alcohol per day are seen to have a slightly higher risk of colorectal cancer in such people
" " ek or adhyayan main paaya gaya ki "aadhaar rekha par pratidin ek yaa ek se adhik maadak peya kii khapat lagbhag 70% se adhik brihadantra cancer ke khatre se judi hoti he

 In our sample, people who consume more than eight doses of beer and spirit per week have been diagnosed by skinning colonoscopy to be at least one in five likely to have colorectal neoplasia
 " Other research suggests that "consuming alcohol lightly is the best way to reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer
" apane colorectal cancer prishth par, rashtriya cancer santhaan ne suchi main alcohol ko jokhim kaarak ke rup main darj nahin kiya he haalanki, ek or prishth par likhaa gaya he ki "baari maatra main alcohol kaa istemaal colorectal cancer ke khatre ko badha saktaa he

 Colorectal cancer is a disease arising from epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract and as a result of mutations with the Wnt signaling pathway
 kuch utparivartan anuvaanshik hote hai or anya uparjit hote hai
 The most common mutated gene of all colorectal cancers is the APC gene, which produces APC protins
 β ketenin par APC protein "brake" he
 Without APC, β-catenin moves into the kidney and binds to DNA and more proteins are activated
 
 In addition to defects in the wnt-apc-beta catenin signaling pathway, other mutations are required for the cell to become cancerous
 p53 jin dwaara TP53 protein utpaadit hota he, saamaanya rup se koshika vibhaajan par nigaraanee rakhata he or yadi unamem Wnt pathave dosha hota he to koshikaon ko nasht kar detaa he
 Ultimately, a cell line acquires a mutation in the p53 gene and transforms tissue from a gland into an invasive carcinoma
 
 Another apoptotic protein is tgf-β
 kam se kam colorectal cancer ke aadhe main, tgf-β main bhi ek vikarmanyan utparivartan hota he
 
 kuch jin onkosin hote hai - ve colorectal cancer main adhik abhivyakt hote hai
 For example, RAS, RAF and PI3K that normally stimulate cells to divide in response to growth factors and with mutations that oversimplify them can be mutated
 saamanytah PTEN PI3K ko roktaa he, lekin kabhi-kabhi PTEN utparivartit ho jate hai
 It takes many years for colorectal cancer to grow and if colorectal cancer is detected at an early stage, treatment may be possible

 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against taking aspirin in a clinical practice guideline
 The task force acknowledged that aspirin may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, but "concluded that high doses of aspirin and the use of NSAID for the prevention of colorectal cancer suppress the benefit"
 a meta-analysis later concluded that "an uncontrolled controlled trial of 300 mg or more of aspirin daily for about 5 years with a latency of 10 years is effective in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer"
 However, taking a dose of more than 81 mg per day for a longer period of time may increase blood flow

 Following asco's recommendations, patients should now undergo KRAS gene mutation testing before being given egfr-inhibiting drugs
 In July 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration updated the label of two anti-egfr monoclonal antibody drugs (cetuximab), indicating the inclusion of information about the KRAS mutation for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
 haalanki, saamaanya KRAS sanskaran hone se in dawaaiyon se rogi ko laabh hone kii guarantee nahin hoti
 Richard Goldberg, MD, director of oncology at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina, stated that "the trouble with the KRAS mutation is that it is downstream of the EGFR
 " "yadi vahaan plag ke neeche laghu anupravah ho to isse koi fark nahin padataa agar ham socket main plag karte hai

 Vishwamitra, burning in the fire of vengeance, curses all the hundred sons of Arundhati and Vashistha to death
 dampati kii kshamaa se shakti naamak ek putr utpann hota he, kintu vishwamitra use bhi ek rakshas dwaara marava dete hai
 Then Arundhati and Vashistha leave their grandson Parashar to spend the Vanaprastha Ashram by entrusting them with the care of the ashram
 parantu brahma unhen punah aashwast karte hue ki ve keval grihasth dampati ke rup main rahete hue hi ram ke darshan kar sakenge, unhen punah grihasthashram main pravesh karne kaa aadesh dete hai
 The couple start living in an ashram near Ayodhya

 Lord Rama and Suyagna study together in the ashram of Arundhati and Vashistha

 Sita and Rama spend fourteen years in exile
 vanvaas ke uparant jab ve ghar lautate hai, to ve pratham baar bhojan karte hai, jo ki swayan arundhati apane haathon se banaati hai
 The epic concludes with this theme

 It includes all the leela-places of Lord Krishna like Mathura, Vrindavan, Govardhan, Gokul, Mahaban, Valdev, Nandgaon, Varsana, Deeg and Kamban etc
 ukt braj kii seemaa ko churaasi kos mana gaya he
 Devoted poets and interlocutors of Surdas and other Vrajbhasha called Braj the ghetto in the adjacent forest area of mathura on the emulation of the Bhagavata Purana, and have given it a different meaning from 'mathura', 'madhupuri' or 'madhuvan'
 braj kshetra main aane vaale pramukh nagar ye hai- mathura, jalesar, bharatpur, agra, hathras, dhaulpur, aligarh, itawa, mainpuri, eta, kasganj, or firozabad
 The word Braj is derived from the Sanskrit metal 'vraj', meaning mobility
 jahaan gaay charati hai or vicharan karti hai vah sthaan bhi braj kaha gaya he
 The author of Amarkosh has given three meanings of Braj - Gotha, Marg and Vrind
 sanskrit ke vraj shabd se hi hindi kaa braj shabd bana he
 In the Vedic codes and the ancient Sanskrit scriptures of Ramayana, Mahabharata etc
, the word Braj is also used in the sense of Goshala, Go-sthan, Gochar Bhumi

 In Vedas to Puranas, Braj has been described as related to cows
 chaahe vah gaayon ko baandhne kaa bada ho, chaahe goshaala ho, chaahe gochar bhoomi ho or chaahe gop-basti ho
 In the Bhagavatakar's view, Gostha, Gokul and Braj are synonyms

 At that time, his foster Nandadi Gop Gana used to roam around Mathura with his gokul in the wide expanses to facilitate his protection and conservation of land
 shrikrishna ke kaaran un gop-gopiyon, gaayon or gochar-bhoomiyon kaa mahatv bad gaya tha
 From the mythological period to the emergence of the Vaishnava cults, as Krishnopasana expanded, so did the glory of the above mentioned traditions of Sri Krishna and his Leela places
 is kaal main yahaan go-paalan kii prachurtaa thi, jiske kaaran vrajakhandon kii bhi prachurtaa ho gai thi
 That is why Mathura, the birthplace of Shri Krishna and the entire region around Mathura connected with his pastimes, was called Braj or Brajmandal
 is prakaar braj shabd kaa kaal-krmanusaar arth vikaas hua he
 During the Vedas and the ramayana-mahabharata, where it was used for small places like 'gostha' - 'go-sthan'
 vahaan puranic kaal main 'gop-basti' jaise kuch bade sthaan ke liye kiya jane laga
 Till that time, the word was regional rather than stately
 bhagwat main 'braj' kshetravayi arth main hi prayukt hua he
 There it is labeled as a small village
 usamen 'poor' se chota 'gram' or usase bhi choti basti ko 'braj' kaha gaya he
 In the 16th century, 'braj' became 'brajmandal' by becoming a state and its shape was thought to be 84 Kos
 us samay mathura nagar 'braj' main sammilit nahin mana jaataa tha
 Surdas and other Braj-language poets have described 'braj' and Mathura as separate, as has been mentioned earlier
 krishna upaask sampradaayon or brajabhasha kaviyon ke kaaran jab braj samskruti or brajabhasha kaa kshetra vistrut hua tab braj kaa aakaar bhi suvistrut ho gaya tha
 At that time not only the city of Mathura, but also the far-off lands, which were influenced by Braj culture and Braj Bhasha, were accepted under Vraj
 vartmaan During the period, most of Mathura district including Mathura city and some part of Deeg and Kamban in Rajasthan, from where Brajyatra passes, is called Braj
