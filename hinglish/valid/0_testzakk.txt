 'sterio' shabd kii utpatti greek shabd stirios se, jiskaa arth 'thos' hota he, hui he or yah rasinic yogicon ke un gunon se sambandhit he jo unke anu ke parmaanuon kii trivim vyavastha par nirbhar hai
 The most prominent fruit of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms is the three-dimensional isomerism
 samaavyavi ve yogic hai jinka anusutra ek samaan hota he, par kuch bhautik tathaa rasinic gunon main ve bhinn hote hai
 This variation is due to the variation of the arrangement of atoms within their molecules
 ethil alkohaul or diemethil ether donon kaa anusutra ek hi C2H6O he, par anuon main parmaanuon kaa vinyas bhinn bhinn he
 There are two types of configurational isomerism: one is optical isomerism and the other is geometric isomerism
 prakaashiya samavyawata asamamit hone ke kaaran prakaashat: sakriy hote hai tathaa bahut se rasinic or bhautik gunon main samaan hote hai
 Their most prominent difference is the action with polarized light, because the rotation of these isomers can be equal and counterclockwise
 jyamitiya samaavyaviyon ke rasinic tathaa bhautik gunon main bhinnata hoti he
 The actual study of the early history of the Vinayasarasayana begins with the discovery of some phenomena of light
 1908 i
 main malus ne ghurnan dwaara prakaash ke dhruvan kii khoj kii or teen varsh baad arago ne sphatik ke prakaash-sakriy hone kaa pataa lagaaya
 In 1815, Vio discovered that solids as well as liquids and gases are photosynthetic in a solution
 vishisht ghurnan - kisi prakaashat: sakriy padaarth kaa vishisht ghurnan sameekaran ke dwaara darshaya jaataa he, jise vishisht ghurnan, prakaash kii tarang lambaai l tathaa t degree taap ke liye he or a prakaash ke ghurnan kaa ansh he, jo 1 centi meter lambii nalee se hokar prakaash ke jane se praapt hua tathaa d nalee main bhari hui prakashaskriy vastu kii prati ghan senmi
 sandratha he
 Rightward rotation is called positive and leftward rotation is called negative
 vishisht ghurnan prakaash tarang, lambaai, taap, vilaayak tathaa sandran par nirbhar he
 Sometimes the direction of rotation becomes opposite due to their change
 shele ne 1768 i
 main tarterik amla angooron ke tarter se praapt kiya tathaa 1819 i
 main cestner ne usee sanghatan kaa ek amla upjaat ke rup main paaya or iskaa naam racemic amla rakhaa
 In 1838, Biao discovered that tartaric acid is optically active, and racemic acid is lightly inactive
 dhruvit prakaash tathaa prakaashat: sakriyata kii khoj ke uparaant vinyasarsayan ke siddhanton main ullekhneey pragati paister ke dwaara hui
 Paster discovered that the composition of tartaric and racemic acids and their structure is HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH, but their physical properties differ
 racemic amla, tarterik amla kii apeksha pani main kam viley he tathaa tarterik amla or uske lavan prakaashat: sakriy hai, par racemic amla or uske lavan prakaashat: niskriy hai
 Paster's most famous discovery was on sodium and ammonium salts of racemic acid
 yah lavan jab jal se 22 degree par crystalikrut hota he, to iske cristan duusare recemet se bhinn hote hai or inaki ardhafalakeey falikaay hoti hai
 Two types of crystals are obtained, one is southward like sodium ammonium tartrate and the other is crystals whose opposite properties are opposite
 is duusare prakaar ke crystal ko darpan pratibimb kii sangya di gai
 When they were separated from the mixture, its aqueous solution was counterclockwise
 isse praapt amla kaa crystal bhi tarterik amla ke crystal ke darpan pratibimb ke rup main tha or vilyan bhi vamavart tha
 Therefore, this acid was considered as another form of tartaric acid
 inke crystal asamamit hote hai : It was found that only those crystals and molecules, whose mirror images are not imputed, are lightly activated
 aisi sanrachana ko asamamit kehete hai
 Many substances are lightly activated only in solid state, such as crystalline, sodium chlorate, etc
 sarvapratham gyaat, prakaashat: sakriy padaarth sphatik hi he, jiske crystal do prakaar ke, ek dakshinvart or doosraa vamavart, hote hai
 These two crystals are mirror reflections of each other and do not impose
 crystal ke aise jodon ko pratibimb rup kehete hai
 Its activation disappears when the crystal is smelted
 isliye sphatik kii prakaashat: sakriyata uske asamamit crystal sanrachana ke kaaran hoti he
 Substances of this class remain lightly active only as long as they are in solid form and their activity is destroyed by melting, evaporation and in solution
 bahut se yogic thos, galan, gasiy yaa vilyan avasthaa main bhi prakaashat: sakriy hote hai, jaise glucose, tarterik amla aadi
 Their activation is due to the unmatched molecular structure of the compound
 is anu or uske darpan pratibimb ko pratibimb rup, prakaashiya prativinyasi yaa prakaashiya samaavyavi kehete hai
 Except for only two things, these forms result from one of the physical properties
 ek hi dhruvit prakaash ke saath baraabar or vipareet ghurnan dete hai or duusare dakshinavart tathaa vamavart vrittiya dhruvit prakaash ke saath inkaa avasorana gunank bhinn hota he
 The chemical properties of reflection forms are the same, but there is often a difference in the reaction with another optically active substance
 sharirkriyaatmak sakriyata main bhi antar ho saktaa he, jaise histydin meetha hota he or histydin swadaheen; nicotine nicotine se adhik vishaiylla hota he
 In 1874, Vant Hoff and Le Bal resolved the existence of the apparently isomerism of organic compounds
 waant half ne vichaar kiya ki carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaa kisi samachatushfalak ke chaaron siron kii taraf nirdeshit he or carbon parmaanu us chatushfalak ke madhya main sthit he
 According to this theory, the four hydrogen atoms of methane will be the same, which has also been proved by physical and chemical reactions
 iske purv 1858 i
 main yah samajha jaataa tha ki carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaayen ek samtal main hai or carbon parmaanu is varg ke centre par he
 The four valencies of carbon in the CX4 molecule are the same and it is conceivable that they have a symmetric configuration in the stereoscope
 is prakaar teen vyavastha sambhav ho sakati he - taleey, piramidia or chatushfalkeey
 If the molecule is unilateral, three forms of the compound c abde may be possible
 yadi anu piramidy he, to is yogic ke chah rup sambhav ho sakate hai
 If the molecule is tetrahedral, only two forms of compound c abde will be possible and both will be mirror reflections of each other
 vastav main yogic c a b d e ek jode pratibimb rup main hi praapt hote hai, jo chatushfalkeey anusanrachana kii pushti karte hai
 When all four groups in carbon are different, then such carbon is called asymmetric carbon
 prakaashat: sakriy carbonic yogicon main ek, athwa ek se adhik, asamamit carbon parmaanu avashya rahete hai
 When both the c abde forms of the asymmetric carbon compound change to Ca2 bd, only one optically inactive substance is obtained, such that both the lactic acid clockwise and counterclockwise give the same propionic acid
 isse chatushfalkeey carbon kii pushti hoti he
 Crystalline analysis of the Runtgen ray, dipole base, absorption spectrum and electron diffraction studies also confirm the tetrahedral nature of carbon
 ganitiya gananaa ke dwaara carbon kii kisi do sanyojaktaa ke bich kaa kone 109 degree 28minute nikaala gaya
 It was previously thought that this valence angle is constant, but it is now known that valence may deviate from its location and this angle can also change
 jab carbon parmaanu se sanyojit sabhi chaaron parmaanu yaa samooh ek se hote hai, to yah kone nishchay hi 109 degree 28 minute hota he, jaisaa methen, CH4, yaa carbon tetracloride, ccl4, main he
 But in methylene chloride CH2 Cl2, the angle is found to be 112 degrees, because greater dispersion in the valence angle is possible due to the repulsive force of large atoms of chlorine
 ek asamamit carbon parmanuwale samaavyaviyon main mukhya antar unki prakaashiya sakriyata main he
 The only difference is in the sign of rotation of both reflection forms
 isliye inhen prakaashat: prativinyasi bhi kehete hai
 The molecule of lactic acid, CH3
CHOH
COOH, has only two optically active isomers, which are mirror mirrors of each other
 inhen dectro - or livo - lactic amla kehete hai
 In equal proportions, the mixture of the two forms is lightly inert, because the rotation of the two reflection forms is the same and the direction is opposite
 aise anu anupaati mishran, jo bahyat: pratikaarit tathaa prakaashat: niskriy hote hai, racemic roopaantar kehalaate hai
 Such racemic compounds are directed by r or dl-prefixes
 is prakaar ek asamamit carbon parmaanu vaala yogic teen roopon main praapt ho saktaa he
 The probability of these isomers is dependent on the asymmetric carbon atom
 carbon kii asamamitati nasht hone par prakaashiya sakriyata tathaa samavyawata donon lupt ho jaati hai
 Decomposition of both forms of activated malic acid gives inactive succinic acid, HOOC
CH2
CH2
COOH
 yogicon main jyon-jyon asamamit carbon parmaanuon kii sankhya badhati jaati he tyon-tyon adhik samaavyavi roopon kii sambhaavna badhati jaati he
 In the normal case of an asymmetric compound consisting of the number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the number of optically active isomers can be 2n and 2n-1 will be pairs of reflection forms f, ie 2n racemic forms
 ve yogic, jinamein do bhinn asamamit carbon parmaanu hon 2 x 2 arthath chaar roopon kii kshamta rakhte hai
 These will have two pairs and each pair will have the same and opposite sign rotations
 donon jodon se do racemic rup bhi praapt honge
 Examples of this type are the cinematic acid dibromide, C6H5
 CH Br
 chbr
 COOH is obtainable in four optically active forms and two racemic forms
 yogic, jinamein donon samaan asamamit carbon parmaanu hon, teen vinyason main paae jate hai, jinamein do prakaashat: sakriy pratibimb rup hote hai or teesraa ant:pratikaarit niskriy hota he or inkaa vibhedan prakaashat: sakriy roopon main nahin ho saktaa
 Apart from these, a racemic form also arises from both active forms
 sankhya 3
 dwaara nideshit padaarth prakaashat: niskriy hota he
 Although it has two active carbons, they neutralize each other, as their rotation is the same and opposite
 is ant:pratikaarit anu ko i athwa meso rup kehete hai
 Inactive and undifferentiated forms are not possible in compounds that have the same asymmetric carbon atom
 yah racemic roopon se bhinn hota he, jinka vibhedan unke prakaashat: sakriy roopon main kiya ja saktaa he
 The best example of this type is dihydroxycinic acid, which has two identical asymmetric carbons and which historically has great value
 siddhant ke anusaar yah dakshinvart, vamavart or meso-tartirik amla roopon ke samaan mishran se praapt hota he
 The southward and counterclockwise are optically transient and the meso and racemic are passive
 inke sanrachanasutra nimna rup se darshaae ja sakate hai : An equivalent mixture of a pair of models is called a racemic form
 yah rup nimna kaarnon se praapt ho saktaa he : By mixing both models in equal amounts
 asamamit yogicon ke sanshleshan main racemic rup praapt hota he
 The process of converting a lightly active compound into a racemic form is called respiration
 praaia: yogicon ke + or - roopon kaa rapeemikaran taap, prakaash or rasinic abhikarmakon ke prabhaav se ho saktaa he
 The action of transformation depends on the compound and the reagents
 kuch yogicon kaa rapeemikaran itani saralata or shighrata se hota he ki unako prakaashat: sakriy rup main nahin praapt kiya ja saktaa
 There are some compounds that are not mixed
 vibhedan yah kriya he jisase racemic roopantaran se uske donon pratibimb rup alag kiye jate hai
 In fact, their quantitative separation is very rare and in some there is only one model
 vibhedan kii kuch vidhiyaan is prakaar hai : Mechanical separation - Paster discovered the method by which the crystals of both models are different and can be separated by hand
 paister ne sodium ammonium tarteret ko 28 degree sein
 par crystalikrut kar, donon prakaar ke crystalon ko chimate se alag alag kiya tha
 The use of this method is very limited
 niveshan dwaara varnatmak crystalan - racemic mishran ke atisantrupt vilyan main jab ek pratibimb rup kaa ek crystal daalaa jaataa he, to pehle usee pratibimb rup kaa crystal hota he or is prakaar us rup kaa pruthakkaran ho saktaa he
 Biochemical resolution - When some bacteria or mold grow on a dilute solution of a racemic, they destroy one image form more quickly than the other
 is prakaar kisi nirdisht samay ke uparaant ek pratibimb rup kii prapti ho sakati he
 Penicillium glaucum, when grown on a solution of racemic ammonium tartrate, destroys the first dextro form and the levo survives
 rasinic vibhedan - yah vidhi sabase uttam he
 In this, the reflection forms of the racemic compound are treated with a lightly active compound, so that they combine together to form compounds that can be easily separated
 racemic amlon ko prakaashat: sakriy ksharak ke saath upachaarit karne se jo lavan banenge, unamem kuch lavan +amla tathaa +ksharak ke honge or kuch lavan - amla tathaa +ksharak ke honge
 Their properties may vary, from which they can be separated by crystallization
 varanatmak avasorana - prakaashat: sakriy padaarthon kaa varanatmak avasorana kisi vishesh prakaashat: sakriy avasorak dwaara ho saktaa he
 Many chemists have done the differentiation by this
 pehle dakshinavart or vamavart pratibimb roopon ko kramash: dactro or livo upsargon se nirdeshit kiya jaataa tha
 Similarly, it was called factory tartaric and levo tartaric acid
 waantahof ne + or - chinhon kaa prayog asamamit carbon ke vinyas ko darshane ke liye kiya he
 Fisher later proposed that the prefixes d and l be used for their configuration position and not to be used for the direction of rotation
 kisi prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke ghurnan kaa chinh praaia: praayogic dasha main parivartan se vipareet ho saktaa he or isi bhaanti unke sanjaton kaa, jinka vinyas usee prakaar he, chinh bhi ghurnan kii disha se vipareet ho saktaa he, jaise vamavart lactic amla ke lavan or aster dakshinavart hote hai or dakshinavart lactic amla ke vamavart
 For all these reasons, it was considered that for lightly active matter such a mark should be used which directly indicates the position of the configuration and this mark is independent of its mark of rotation direction
 glissraldihide, jisamen ek asamamit carbon parmaanu he, do pratibimb roopon main prapya he or ek swaichh nishchay ke anusaar dakshinavart rup ko aise darshaate hai ki hydraxil, -OH, samooh kaa carbon daahine or hydrogen parmaanu vaain taraf hota he
 According to the arrangement of tetrahedral carbon, the hydrogen and hydroxyl groups are above the surface of the surface and the -CHO and -CH2OH groups are below the surface of the surface
 glissraldihide ke is vinyas ko d kehete hai
 According to popular practice, the group connected by a horizontal line is above the surface of the page
 is bhanti iske pratibimb kii dasha kaa sanket hai
 The configurations related to the authentic configuration of this D-glyceraldehyde fall under the D-class, ie compounds that can be derived from D-glyceraldehyde, or can be converted to D-glyceraldehyde by chemical reaction, into the D-range
 Come
 is tarah glissraldihide kaa puraa naam d glissraldihide or l glissraldihide hota he
 And indicate its rotation direction
 inke eldihide samooh ko agle sajaateey - CHOH - CHO main badla ja saktaa he or jaise ki isamen ek asamamit carbon he vaise hi har glissraldyhide do rup denge
 In carbon compounds, when one group is replaced by another group, it is understood that the substituent replaces the removed group
 yadi ek prakaashat: sakriy yogic a saadhaaran pratisthaapan abhikriya se ba yogic main parivartit hota he, to inke vinyas ek se hote hai
 This is true, but sometimes the configuration changes as well as replacement
 is vinyas parivartan ko prakashkeey pratilomon, yaa avishkaarak wolden ke naam se walden pratilomon kehete hai
 a simple example of this is the substitution of chlorine in chloroxynic acid from the hydroxyl group, malic acid is obtained and southward acid is obtained using potassium hydroxide

 The term tube well itself makes it clear that a well is created by a tube
 jab dhaatuke nal ko jameen main itnaa dhasa dete hai ki vah jalastr tak pahunch jaay to is prakaar nalakup kaa nirmaan hota he
 The tube wells are pumped with water using a machine-driven pump and used for drinking or irrigation
 vaise coop athwa kuen, prithvi ko khodakar banaae jate rahe hai or kahin-kahin unamem seedhiyaan lagaakar "baawali" kaa rup bhi diya jaataa rahaa he
 Such wells are made especially in those places where there are sandy sources in the ground where water can be found
 ye strot bhi jalplavit hon or itani gaharaai par na hon ki saamaanya khudaai dwaara un tak pahunchnaa asambhav ho athwa un tak pahunchne ke liye kisi chattan yaa kankadon ke str ko paar karnaa pade
 Here in the present era, when it has been possible to construct the taps, especially the metal taps, then it has also been possible to reach such waters, which cannot be reached by digging
 ab to prithvi kii sataha se hi nalon ko prithvi main galane se jalstaron tak pahunchnaa aasaan ho gaya he
 Likewise tube wells started to be formed
 ek tripad lagaakar prithvi main thonk thonkkar "voki" dwaara nal galaaya jaataa he
 When the tap reaches the water, a small diameter tap is inserted into it
 is chote nal ke nichle sire par jaali laga di jaati he jisamen hokar pani nal main aa sake
 a manual pump is installed above this tap
 is prakaar saamaanya gharelu nalakup ban jaataa he
 They are used everywhere
 jab adhik maatra main jal nikaalane kii aavashyaktaa hui jaise badi jalapradaay yojanaon ke liye athwa bhusinchan yaa anya udyogon ke liye, tab nalkupon kaa vistaar karne kii yojana main atyadhik vikaas hua
 For the construction of large tubewells, it is necessary to first make a deep round hole in the earth by a large tap or by other means, and from that hole it is estimated that how many levels are found which are inundated and their thickness is
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek saamaanya sinchai ke nalakup ke liye uttar pradesh ke ganga-yamuna-doaab main pehle das yaa aath inch paridhi kaa 300, 350 yaa 400 foot gaharaa chhidr kiya jaataa he
 While perforation it is estimated that the types of levels have been penetrated and the samples extracted from them are judged to be filled with water
 yadi lagbhag 100 foot kaa aisa str mil jaataa he to acchhee maatra main us chhidr se jal praapt hone kii aashaa kii jaati he
 Although the amount of water available can be estimated only by extracting water, but many things depend on the experience in this regard
 jalplavit baaluu kaa jo str miltaa he usamen jaali daali ja sakati he
 This mesh is mounted on porous tubes and through which water enters the tube well

 Some are made of copper wires, some are made by making grooves in brass sheets
 kahin-kahin chhidradaar nal ke upar nariyal kii rassi lapetakar jaali kii jagah prayog kiya jaataa he
 All these tools are used so that clean water can be filtered and come inside the tube well and from there it can be pumped up
 nalakup main jal chaanane kii ek nai pranali yah bhi he ki chhidradaar nal nalakup main utaar die jate hai or unke chaaron ore bajri bhar di jaati he jo jaali kaa kaam karti he or keval svachh jal ko nalakup main aane detii he
 Whether or not the sand particles around the tubewells flow with water depends on the speed of water coming into the tubewell
 vaise to nalakup banane ke samay hi is maatra tak pani nikaal diya jaataa he ki aas paas ke nikalanevaale baaluu ke kan baahar nikal jaaen or ek sthaayee sthiti si nalakup ke chaaron ore paidaa ho jaae jisase pani ke nikaas ke saath ret na aa sake
 This is called development of tube wells
 nalakup kii nirmanvidhi main bahut se sudhaar hote ja rahe hai
 Different types of machines are used to penetrate the earth
 in mashiinon ke dwaara nalkupon ke nirmaan main sahaayta hi nahin milti, varan kaam bhi jaldi ho jaataa he
 Somewhere, even without taps, holes are made in the earth and at the same time they are sealed with a solution of clay
 phir usamen nalakup ke nal utaar die jate hai
 "trough" tube wells can also be formed if a good thick layer of clay is found and then there is a level of well-watered sand below it
 isamen aisa hota he ki ret baahar nikal jane par chikani mitti ke str ke neeche ek gart ban jaataa he, jisamen pani aata rahata he or ise nalakup ke pump dwaara baahar nikaala jaataa he
 Several types of pumps are used to extract water from tube wells
 pehle pahal apkendri pump lagaae gaye the, jinke dwaara pani simit oonchaai tak hi uthaaya ja saktaa tha
 Now the promotion of turbine type bore hole pump has increased
 in panpon dwaara pani bahut unchaai tak uthaaya ja saktaa he
 In addition, submersible pumps are also used
 ye pump or motor donon pani ke andar duube rahete hai
 There is great convenience in extracting and applying them
 nalkupon ke sambandh main vishesh ullekhneey baat yah he ki nalkupon dwaara bhugarbha se pani kabhi-kabhi badi maatra main nikaal liya jaataa he
 The quantity of water in the underground is limited and its annual output is also limited
 jitna pani prati varsh bhugarbha main pravesh karata he yadi usase adhik pani nalkupon dwaara bhugarbha se nikaala jaataa he to usase bhugarbha kaa jalatal nicha ho jaataa he or kabhi-kabhi uskaa bada dushprinaam hota he
 On the west coast of North America, California created so many tubewells for industry and agriculture that the groundwater of the ground was so low that the sea water got into the groundwater and all the water was spoiled
 at: nalakup se pani nikaalane ke purv is baat kii pariksha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki kisi kshetra main itane nalakup na lag jaaen ki bhugarbhan main sthit jalatal par uskaa dushprinaam pahunche
 By the way, such arrangements are made at such places that the penetration of water into the ground can be maximized
 bhugarbha ke andar sthit jalsroto kaa anumaan kar sakna kathin kaary ho jaataa he, at: nalkupon ke vistaar kii seemaa nirdhaarit karnaa bhi kathin ho jaataa
 Somewhere, the accumulated water of the ages is taken out and used by tube wells, and then the difficulty is faced when the water in the ground is reduced
 at: nalkupon ke vistaar main satarkta kii avashyaktaa hoti he
 The time the water is drawn by the tube wells, at that time the water in the nearby ordinary wells gets drained and at some places the wells dry up completely
 is sambandh main anveshan karne se gyaat hua he ki nalakup ke chaaron ore jalatal giraav kii keep ke rup main pani kaa str ho jaataa he at: jo saadhaaran kuen is keep ke andar aa jate hai unamem jalatal gir jaataa he
 This investigation also gives an idea of how many large tube wells can be built at a distance or what system of operation should be put in place so that there is no snatch of water among themselves
 yadi yah satarkta na barti jaae to jalastr par bura prabhaav pad saktaa he tathaa nalkupon ko bhi kshati pahunch sakati he
 By the way, wherever there is a possibility of getting water in the underground, tube wells are being made in large numbers everywhere
 nalkupon dwaara bahut se kshetron main krishi or udyog main badi pragati hui he

 baayin disa main sthit chitra main, yadi bade varg kaa kshetrafal 1 he to sabase bade kaale varg kaa kshetrafal = 1 / 4 hoga
 Similarly, the area of the second largest square would be 1 / 16 and that of the third largest would be 1 / 64

 Since the area of the whole square is made up of all these three types of squares, it is 1, so as per the picture archimedis kaa chithran isse thodaa bhinn he, jo sameekaran ke nikat he See below for details on Archimedes' interpretation

 Psychosis is a state of mental health of a person that is not called 'normal' when compared to a healthy person
 swasth vyaktiyon kii tulana main manorogon se grast vyaktiyon kaa vyavhaar asaamaanya athwa duranukuli nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he or jisamen mahatvapurn vyathaa athwa asamarthta antargrast hoti he

 In psychology, unusual and inappropriate behavior for us is called psychosis
 ye dhire-dhire badhate jate hai
 There are many factors of psychosis, including heredity, weak personality, lack of tolerance, childhood experiences, stressful situations and inability to cope with them
 ve sthitiyaan, jinhen hal kar paanaa evam unka saamana karnaa kisi vyakti ko mushkil lagata he, unhen 'tanaav ke kaarak' kehete hai
 Stress imposes such requirements and demands on a person, which he considers extremely difficult and difficult to fulfill
 in maangon ko puraa karne main lagaataar asafalataa milane par vyakti main maansik tanaav paidaa hota he
 In today's time, stress has become a very common experience for people, which is expressed by a lot of physical and psychological reactions
 tanaav kii paaramparik paribhaasha daihik pratikriya par kendrit he
 Hans Shale discovered the term 'stress' and defined it as an uncertain response based on any body requirement
 hens style kii paribhaasha kaa aadhaar daihik he or yah hormones kii kriyaaon ko adhik mahatv detii he, jo adrinal or anya granthiyon dwaara sravit hote hai
 Shale conceptualized two types of tensions - tanaav par naveen upaagam vyakti ko uplabdh samyoji sansadhano ke sambandh main sthiti ke moolyankan evam vyakhya kii bhoomika par kendrit he
 Interdependent processes of evaluation and adjustment determine the relationship between the environment of the individual and his adaptation

 When faced with stressful situations, the person usually adopts problem-focused or emotion-focused diplomacy
 samasya kendrit niti dwaara vyakti apane baudwik saadhaanon ke prayog se tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa samaadhaan dhundta he or praayah ek prabhaavshaalee samaadhaan kii ore pahunchataa he
 When faced with stressful situations with an emotion-focused strategy, the person displays emotional behavior such as shouting
 yadhyapi, yadi koi vyakti tanaav kaa saamana karne main asamarth hota he tab vah pratirohak-abhivinyast kootneeti kii ore rujhaan kar letaa he, yadi ye barbar apanaae jaaen to vibhinn manovikar utpann ho sakate hai
 Resistant-oriented behavior does not make it able to face the situation, it is only a means to justify its actions
 shaareerik samasyaayein jaise fever, khaansee, zukam ityadi ye vibhinn prakaar ke manovikar hote hai
 The list of psychologists in these classes ranges from minimal anxiety to severe psychosis such as dementia or fragmented mentality
 america manovikari sangh dwaara manovikaron par naidanik or sankhyikeey niyam pustak ) ko prakashit kiya gaya he jis main vividh prakaar ke maansik vikaron kaa ullekh kiya gaya he

 And autism disorder in which the child becomes introverted, does not smile at all and learns language late
 yadi koi vyakti bina kisi vishesh kaaran ke daraa hua, bhaybheet yaa chintaa mahasoos karata he to kaha ja saktaa he ki vah vyakti vyagrata vikaar se grast he
 There are different types of anxiety disorder in which anxiety is manifested in various forms

 Individuals who suffer from experiences of mood disorder have their moods restricted for a long period of time, those individuals settle on one emotion, or switch between these categories of emotions
 udhaaharan swaroop chaahe koi vyakti kuch dinon tak udhaas rahe yaa kisi ek din udhaas rahe or duusare hi din khush rahe, us ke vyavhaar kaa paristhiti se kuch sambandh na ho
 In this way there are two types of mood disorders dependent on the behavioral symptoms of the person - avsaad aisi maansik avasthaa he jo ki udaasi, ruchi kaa abhaav or pratidin kii kriyaaon main prasannataa kaa abhaav, ashaant nidra va neend ghat janaa, kam bhukh laganaa, vajan kam ho naa, yaa zyada bhukh laganaa va vajan badhanaa, aalas, doshi mahasoos karnaa, ayogyata, asahaayta, niraashaa, ekaagratha sthapit karne main pare shaani or apane va dusron ke prati nakraatmak vichaardhaara ke lakshanon ko darshaati he
 If such a person stays at such a price for a minimum of two weeks, he can be said to be depressive and it is necessary to provide him prompt clinical treatment for his treatment
 aaj ke samay main kuch bimaariyaan bahut hi saadhaaran ban chuki hai jaise nimna raktchaap, ucch raktchaap, madhumeh aadi
 Although they are all physical diseases, but they arise from psychological reasons like stress and anxiety
 atah manodaihik vikaar ve manovaigyanik samasyaayein hai jo shaareerik lakshan darshaatin hai, lekin iske kaaran manovaigyanik hote he
 At the same time, in the concept of psychosomatic, the meaning of mind is manas and somatic means body
 iske vipareet daihikroop vikaar, ve vikaar hai jinke lakshan shaareerik he parantu inke jaivik kaaran saamne nahin aate
 For example, if a person is complaining of stomachache but even when there is no problem of that particular part ie stomach
 kisi-kisi abhighataj ghatana ke baad vyakti apana pichhlaa astitv, gat ghatnaayen or aas-paas ke logon ko pahchaanane main asamarth ho jaataa he

 vighatnsheel smritilop, vighatnsheel manovikar kaa ek varg he, jisamen vyakti aamtaur par kisi tanaavpurn ghatana ke baad mahatvapurn vyaktigat soochna ko yaad karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 In the state of dissolution, a person realizes his new existence
 doosraa varg vighatnsheel pahchaan vikaar he jisamen vyakti apni yaaddaasht to kho hi detaa he vahiin naye astitv kii kalpana karne lagata he
 The other category is personality disorder, in which a person feels sudden changes or variably odd
 vyakti is prakaar mahasoos karata he jaise usne apane sharir ko tyaag diya ho yaa phir us kii gatividhiyaan achaanak se yantric yaa swapn ke jaisi ho jaati he
 However, the most serious situation of disintegration psychosis arises when there is a multiple personality psychosis and dissolution psychosis
 is sthiti main vividh vyaktitv ek hi vyakti main alag-alag samay par prakat hote hai
 You may have seen someone on the street in dirty clothes, eating unhygienic food lying around the garbage or interacting or behaving strangely

 Dementia disorders include inconsistent mindset, faulty perception, obstruction of operative activities, monotonous and inappropriate expressions
 isse grast vyakti vaastaviktaa se nirlypt rahete hai or aksar kaalpaniktaa or bhranti kii duniya main khoye rahete he

 bhramasakti vaastaviktaa ke prati andhavishwaas he is tarah ke vishwaas dusron se sambandh viched karte hai
 There are different types of psychosis, such as catatonic psychosis
 vyaktitv vikaar kii jaden kisi vyakti ke shishav kaal se judin hoti hai, jahaan kuch bachche lochaheen va ashudv vichaardhaara viksit kar lete hai
 These different personalities emerge from a harmless isolation in a psychotic person as emotionless sequential killers

 At first, the group is characterized by strange and eccentric behavior
 chintaa or shaq duusare samooh kii visheshta he or tisare samooh kii visheshta he naatakeey, bhavpurn or aniyamit vyavhaar

 kaary abhivinyast prakriya kaa uddeshy kisi vishesh tanaav kaarak dwaara adhiropit kii gai samyoji maang kaa yathartwadita se samaadhaan dhundhna he
 These are based on objective assessment of stressful situations at conscious and rational levels
 tanaav se nipatane ke in tareekon ko teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya gaya he jaise prarambh, pratyaahaar or samjhauta
 Coping with stress through emotion-focused or self-defense-oriented methods is not beneficial, as the individual does not arrive at a solution through it, just finding ways to reassure themselves
 aatmarakshak paddatiyon kaa udhaaharan budvisangat vyakhya karnaa he jaise yah tark dena ki sabhi vidhyaarthee isiilie asafal rahe, kyonki pariksha-patr kaaphi kathin tha

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class

 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians
 madhya asia ke "kurgan kabr-tile" pracheen aaryon dwaara banaaye gayi maane jate hai
 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia
 is baat ko kai bhartiya or hindutv-vaadi maanate hai, par baaki duniya main is drushtikon kii koi kadra nahin he
 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture

 raajnneetik party Jaisingh Siddharaj, son of Karna Karna and Mayanalladevi of Gujarat was in many ways the best emperor of that dynasty
 siddhraj uskaa virud tha
 He was born in 1094 AD
 pita kii mrityu ke samay vah alpavayask tha atev uski mata mayanalladevi ne kai varshon tak abhibhavika ke rup main shashan kiya tha
 After becoming an adult and taking over the reigns, Jai Singh turned his attention to the conquest of the neighboring states
 anek yudhon ke ananthar hi vah saurashtra ke aabhir shaasha navaghan athwa khangaar ko parajeet kar sakaa
 For the rule of the conquered region, he appointed an officer named Sajjan as the governor, but perhaps Jaisingh's authority could not be sustained
 jaisingh ne chalukyon ke puraane shatru nadol ke chaahmaan vansh ke aashaaraj ko adheenta sweekaar karne or samant ke rup main shashan karne ke liye baadhya kiya
 He also invaded the Chahamana kingdom of Shakambari in the north and took over his capital
 kintu ek kushalanitijna ke samaan usne apane paksh ko shaktishaalee banane ke liye apni putree kaa vivaah chaahmaan naresh arnoraaj ke saath kar diya or arnoraaj ko samant ke rup main shashan karne diya
 He was aided by Asharaj and Arnoraj against the Paramara Naresh Naravarman of Malav
 dirghakaalin yuddh ke pashchaat narvarman bandi hua lekin jaisingh ne baad main use mukt kar diya
 Narvarman's son Yashovarman also kept the war going
 ant main vijay phir bhi jaisingh kii hi hui
 The captive Yashovarman had to stay in prison for some time
 is vijay ke upalaksh main jaisingh ne avantinath kaa virud dhaaran kiya or anvatimandal ke shashan ke liye mahadev ko niyukt kiya
 But in the last years of Jai Singh's reign, Yashovarman's son Jayavarman had liberated some part of Malwa state
 jaisingh ne bhinmaal ke parmarvansheey someshwar ko apane rajya ke kuch bhaag ko swatantra kar liya tha
 Jaisingh helped Bhinmal's Paramara dynasty Someswar regain his kingdom and possibly invaded East Punjab with him
 jaisingh ko chandel naresh madanvarman ke viruddh koi ullekhneey safalataa nahin praapt ho saki
 Possibly apprehensive of Madanavarman's successes in Malava, he formed friendly relations with Kalchuri and Gahadwalas of Tripuri
 kalyaan ke pashchimi chalukya vansh ke vikramaditya shashth ne narmada ke uttar main or laat tathaa gurjar par kai vijayon kaa ullekh kiy he
 But these must have been mere transient campaigns and had no effect on the Chalukya kingdom
 apane ek abhilekh main jaisingh ne permardi par apni vijay kaa ullekh kiya he kintu sambhaavna he ki parajeet naresh koi saadhaaran raja tha, prasiddh chalukya naresh nahin
 Jaisingh has also been credited with the victory over Sindhuraj, who must have been a local Muslim feudal of Sindh
 jaisingh ne barbarak ko bhi parajeet kiya jo sambhavat: gujarat main rahanevaali kisi anarya jati kaa vyakti tha or siddhpur ke saadhuon ko traas detaa tha
 As a result of his victories, Jai Singh expanded the boundaries of the Chalukya empire, which was not possible in the time of any other ruler of that dynasty
 uttar main uskaa adhikaar jodhpur or jaipur tak tathaa pashchim main bhilsa tak failaa hua tha
 Kathiawar and Kutch were also included in his kingdom
 jaisingh putraheen tha
 For this reason the last years of his life were sad
 uski mrityu ke baad singhaasana uske pitruvy kshemraj ke praputra kumarpal ko mila
 But Kshemraj was not the son of Auras, so Jai Singh made Bahad, the son of his minister Udayan, his adopted son
 apni vijayon se adhik jaisingh apane saanskrithik krityon ke kaaran smaraneey he
 Jai Singh made Gujarat a center of education and literature by promoting poets and scholars
 in sahityakaron main se ramchandra, acharya jaimangal, yashahchandra or vardhaman ke naam ullekhneey hai
 He had given the title of Kavindra to Shripal and called him his brother
 lekin in sabhi se adhik vidvan or prasiddh tathaa jaisingh kaa vishesh priy or snehapaatr jisaki bahumukhi pratibha ke kaaran anya samakaleen vidwaanon kaa mahatv chamak nahin paaya, jain pandit hemchandra tha
 He has immortalized the name of Siddharaj through his grammar treatise Siddhemachandra
 jaisih shaivamtavlambee tha
 According to Meruttung, at the behest of his mother, he abolished the tax on passengers in Bahulod
 lekin dharmik maamle main uski niti udaar or samdarshi thi
 Most of his contemporary scholars were Jains
 kintu inako sangrakshan dene main uskaa jainiyon ke prati koi pakshpaat nahin tha
 Once he asked the Acharyas of different faiths to know the truth about God and religion, but in the end, under the influence of Hemachandra, he considered the path of virtue best
 islam ke prati bhi uski niti udaar thi
 His most important work was the temple of Rudramala in Siddhpur, which is famous for its expansion in temples in India
 usne sahasraling jhil bhi nirmit kii or uske sameep ek kirtistambh banwaaya
 On the banks of Saraswati, he also built the temple of Dasavatara Narayan

 Planets are not the cause of happiness, sorrow, disease, suffering, wealth, misfortune
 in falon kii prapti kaa kaaran to manushya ke shubhashubh karm hi hote hai
 Human beings who have done efficient or unskilled deeds in previous lives, the planets in the horoscope, according to them, sit in different positions in zodiac signs and sentiments and inform the future

 Thus, the planet is not responsible for diseases
