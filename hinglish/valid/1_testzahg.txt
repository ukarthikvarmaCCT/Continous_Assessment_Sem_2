onyomi ko unke utpatti ke samay or sthaan ke anusaar chaar prakaaron main baanta jaataa he: go ko Ear-on reading is the most common reading and often leads to difficulties with non-ear-on reading in a word, such as gay-doku which is a go-on reading, where 解 is commonly read
 buddha shabdaawalee main go-on zyaada istemaal kiye jate hai, jaise gokuraku 
 Some new words are also found on them, such as Isu and Futon
 go-on, kaan-on, or to-on pathan aam taur par sajaateey hai, jinaki utpatti puraani chini bhashaa se hui
 Onyomi are commonly found in multi-kanji words, adopted in Japanese with their kanji, often for ideas and things that had no word in Japanese
 kunyomi pathan kisi shabd kaa moulik pathan he, jo us shabd ke japani uccharan, yaa yamato kotoba par aadhaarit he
 Like Onyomi, a Kanji can have more than one Kunyomi, and some Kanji have no Kunyomi
 udhaaharan ke liye, "purv" kaa kanji he 東, jiskaa onyomi he to, jo madhya chini tung se aayaa he
 But in Japanese there are two words for the former - Higashi and Azuma
 isliye, higashi or aazuma 東 ke kunyomi pathan hai
 寸, in contrast, is a Chinese unit of measure, and has no Japanese word, so it has only one onyomi, hear
 adhiktar kocuji, jo japan main bane kanji hai, ke keval kunyomi pathan hai
 Kuniyomi's specialty is that every letter has a consonant and a vowel sound
 adhiktar sangya or visheshan kunyomi do se teen akshar vaale shabd hai, or kriya kunyomi main ek se teen akshar hote hai
 It is different from Onyomi which are all single letter, and different from other languages that use Chinese script
 
 承 る Uketemavaru, 志 Kokorozashi, and 詔 Mikoronori have five letters of a kanji, the longest in the list of jio kanji
 aise kai yogic kanji shabd hai jahaan onyomi or kunyomi kaa mishran kaa upyog hota he
 These words are called jucabo or yuto according to their order, which are themselves such mixed words
 jukabo k pehla akshar kaa onyomi padhaa jaataa he, or duusare kaa kunyomi
 Yuto has the opposite
 in shabdon ko aupchaarik taur par jukaboyomi or yutoyomi kehete hai
 Other examples are Basho, Kiniro and omo-shiro-i face-whitening aikido
 gikun or pēji kehete hai
 Gikun are non-standard Kanji used for effect, such as the reading of 寒 Fuyu
 jukusikun unhen kehete hai jab ek shabd kaa maanak kanji uske arth se sambandhit he, par uske dhwani se nahin
 For example, 今朝 is a jukujikun, and does not read imaasa or koncho, but rather kesa, a word of Japanese origin
 isi tarah 明日 ko aakaarihi yaa meinichi nahin padhaa jaataa, balki ashita padhate hai
 In some rare cases the reading of a Kanji is derived from a foreign language
 pramukh udhaaharan hai peji, botan, zero or metoru 
 They are classified in Kuniyomi itself, as this letter is used for its meaning
 lekin adhiktar kunyomi ke vipareet, ye pathan japani se nahin balki anya bhashaaon se lee gai hai, iskie unako kunyomi kahana bhraamak he
 Some are lesser known readings of Kanji called Nanori
 inkaa upyog naamon ke liye hota he or ye kunyomi se sambandhit hai
 Nanori is often used in place names
 jaise, upnaam 小鳥遊 jiskaa taatpary he ki koi shikari nahin hai
 It is pronounced "kotori Asobu"
 iskaa arth 鷹がいない bhi ho saktaa he, or ise sankshep main taakanashi bhi padhaa ja saktaa he
 There are rules for the use of Onyomi and Kunyomi, but there are many exceptions in Japanese, and even a Japanese speaker without prior experience cannot know with certainty the reading of a letter
 japani padhate samay pathak ko shabd or unke pathan pahchaanane padate hai, na ki shabd kaa ek-ek akshar
 The main instruction is that if kanji is followed by okurigana, then kunyomi is always used there, whereas multi-kanji words generally have onyomi
 ekal kanji kaa aam taur par kunyomi padhaa jaataa he
 Okurigana is used to show the disorder at the end of a verb or adjective
 chini shabdon ke ant main lagaakar unhen kriya banaaya ja saktaa he
 Some famous place names, such as Japan and Tokyo, are read in Onyomi, but most Japanese names are Kunyomi: 大阪 Osaka, 青森 Aomori, 箱根 Hakone
 japani upnaam bhi aam taur par kunyomi main padhe jate hai: 山田 yamada, 田中 tanaka, 鈴木 suzuki
 They are not considered Jubako or Yuto, but they are often a mixture of Kunyomi, Onyomi, and Nanori, such as 大 助 Daisuke and 夏 美 Natsumi
 kyonki naam unke parijanon par nirbhar he, kisi ke naam kaa pathan kisi niyam par aadhaarit nahin he
 In order to remove the possibility of any confusion in pronunciation, it is necessary to write the name in both Kana and Kanji in the documents
 chini vyaktiyon or jagahon ke naam jab japani paath main aate hai, unhen hameshaa onyomi main padhaa jaataa he
 This can make the Japanese pronunciation very different from the Chinese pronunciation
 jaise, maao xedong ko mo takuto padhaa jaataa he, or vanararaj sun vukong ko son goku
 Nowadays, Chinese names which are not well known in Japan are written in Katakana which is close to its Chinese pronunciation
 khaaskar aise shahar ho mongol yaa maanchu bhashaaon se aae hon
 Names of famous Chinese cities are pronounced according to their Old English names, regardless of their Onyomi or Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese accent
 shianggong Beijing shanghai Nanjing tibei Come on gaoshinong Because of all these problems, Kanji's pronunciation is sometimes shown in small letters near him, which is called furigana
 aisa aksar bacchon yaa japani seekhney waalon ke liye kitabon main kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in newspapers and manga for rare words or Kanji
 kyonki kanji multah chini haanazi akshar hai, adhiktar aksharon ke arth chini or japani main ek hi hai
 Nevertheless, after centuries of development, there are many Kanji that have different meanings in Chinese language
 japani main kocuji un aksharon ko kehete hai jo china ke baahar bane hai
 Kanji made in Japan is called Wasei Kanji
 unhen chini aksharon kii tarah hi do ghatakon ko jodakar banaaya jaataa he, par jaise china main na hua ho
 Such letters are called Gukaja in Korean
 kyonki kocuji ko sthaneey shabdon ke liye banaaya jaataa he, unke keval kun pathan hote hai
 But some also have their own reading
 joyo kanji main nimnlikhit 9 kocuji hai
 Jinmeyo in Kanji hyogiji In addition to kokuji, there are kanji that have been given meanings in Japanese different from their original Chinese meanings
 These are not considered kokuji but are instead called kok kun and include characters such as: jaapni vidhyaarthiyon ko buniyadi 1006 kanji akshar kaksha 6 tak siikhnaa padataa he
 There is a definite sequence of their learning
 vidhyaarthiyon ko naveen kaksha tak sabhi 2136 joyo kanji seekhney padate hai
 The Japanese government takes Kanji Keitei, who tests the ability to write and read Kanji

 On the strength of their unity and organization power, they could have made some other efforts instead of forming a cooperative society, such as pressuring the factory owners to change their position by aligning with the political powers
 Or by making parliamentary lobby to compel government and administration to implement necessary programs in labor laws by implementing necessary changes in company laws
 It was also easy for them to go to the shelter of religious leaders, unions or churches and create an atmosphere in their favor, so that the government and factory owners pay attention to the interests of the workers
 The government enacted necessary laws in favor of labor rights
 Owners should spend a part of their profits on labor welfare programs
 They could also prepare them for a long strike, taking advantage of workers' dissatisfaction; And there was every chance that he would get success in his goal

 is samachaarpatr kaa pehla ank 1 may 1828 ko niklaa tha or uske baad se lagaataar yah logon main sahakaarita ke prati chetana jagaane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha
 With his inspiration, the first co-operative society was established in England, in 1830, the name was - Rochedale Friendly Co-operative Society
 Since the laborers used to get salary on monthly or weekly basis
 atev samiti main sadasyon ko unke dainik upyog kii vasteen udhaar bechi jaatin thim
 The rule was made that the laborers' committee returned the loan as soon as the salary was paid, and everything went well for a few days
 But over time everything started messing up
 Due to some compulsion, at some point of time, members started to ignore the loan taken
 After all, that committee had to be closed due to heavy losses
 atharah sau chauntis main pehali baar vyavastha ke str par krantikari sudhaar dekhne main aayaa
 However, the public was not able to fully take advantage of those reforms
 is kaaran nae sudhaaron kii upyogita kaa purnatah moolyankan shaayad un dinon sambhav nahin tha
 In those days the government made another amendment to the Committee Registration Act, on the basis of which the definition of benefits was extended to any kind of perquisites
 nae adhinium ke antargat kisi bhi vidhimaanya laabh kii prapti ke liye samiti kaa gathan kiya ja saktaa tha
 The legal reforms in the 7 Act also inspired the Rochedale Pioneers to once again reorganize and take advantage of the act in which they had unsuccessful success
 sabase pehle jo log samiti ke rup main aage aae unki kul sankhya athis thi
 All of them were ordinary laborers belonging to weaver families working in Rochedale
 usase pehle bhi mil mazdooron kii sthiti main sudhaar ke liye andolan kar chuke the
 Prominent among those who played the role of eminence were Charles Howarth, Abraham Greenwood, John Hilton, David Brook and William Cooper
 james smith jaan scracraft Charles Howth John Hill wiliam kupar jaan halt David Brook James Stranding jaan kaliyar james manok Samuel Asworth Joseph Smith wiliam malalu wiliam tailor George Heale Robert Taylor mills esworth baijanmin rudmen James Daly James Wilkinson james twidle jaan garcid Samuel Tweedley John Bent james madan james bemford Mills Asworth was made the first chairman of the committee, but Charles Howarth's contribution to the formation of the committee was indescribable
 samiti ke niyamon kii abhiklpana main uski bhoomika mukhya thi
 With the combined efforts of all of them, the foundation of the 'rosdale Equiteville Pioneers Society' was laid, which later achieved many records in the field of consumer cooperative movement and became the main motivator of the cooperative movement
 The founding members of the committee are further respected for their co-operative spirit by calling them 'khyabilabdha Athais'
 charles havarth ‘di roshadel equitevil pynirs socity’ ke vidhaan kaa pramukh vaastukar tha
 It was he who created the framework of the committee's legislation
 atev usko ham todlan main sthapit pehali sahakaari samiti kaa pramukh nitikaar, abhikalpak, vichaarak, utprerak aadi maan sakate hai
 Howarth, an ordinary laborer by profession, used to work in the textile weaving factory
 uski aasthaa samaajawaadee vichaaron main thi
 Howarth was also influenced by Robert Owen's ideas
 usko vishwaas tha ki oven ke vichaaron par chalakar ek nae samanta par aadhaarit samaaj kaa gathan sambhav he
 Charles participated in many movements to improve the condition of the workers
 us samay tak kaary ke ghante tay nahin the
 The factory owners worked for sixteen to eighteen hours in a single day
 havarth ne is mudde par sakriyata dikhaate hue dainik kaaryghanton ko das ghante tak simit karne ke liye laae gaye ‘das ghanta adhinium’ ke paksh main kai sabhaayen kin
 haalanki us samay bahut se mil majdoor is sanshodhan vidheyak ke paksh main nahin the or ise maalikon tathaa kamgaaron ke bich kaa mudda maanate hue kisi bhi prakaar ke hastkshep ke viruddh the
 Despite this, Howarth went to London to create an atmosphere in favor of that bill and was also present during the debate on the bill in the House of Commons
 It affected the administration and the government
 The 'rochedale Equiteville Pioneers Society' was not his first attempt
 oven se prabhavit hokar havarth ne san 1830 isvi main ek samooh kaa gathan kiya tha, jiskaa netaa vah swayan tha
 Howarth's dream was to achieve collective goals through organized power, which would increase the chances of improving the economic condition of the people
 To make his dream come true, Howarth arranged for a rental shop at a place called Todd Lane in Rochedale
 vastutah vah purana godaam tha, jo varshon se khaali padaa tha
 His address was — Todd Lane, Rochedale
 The shop rent was fixed at £ 10 yearly
 dukaan ko unhone ‘ko-aaparative shaap’ kaa naam diya tha
 The idea of distributing among the members in proportion to the capital levied for the benefit of the cooperative is due to the cooperative
 vyavsaay ko dhang se chalaane ke liye havarth ne kuch niyam bhi banaae the
 According to him, members could buy goods borrowed from that shop
 udhaar kaa bhugtan ek saptaah ke bich kiya janaa tay tha
 Initially, the members remained confident and enthusiastic about that collaborative venture
 But gradually the weaknesses of that system started to appear
 Because many members were unable to pay on the due date
 or is tarah udhaar dhire-dhire badhkar ek vishaal rakam kaa rup le chukaa tha
 a lot of money was being drowned out of it
 us dauraan havarth ko apni ek or bhul kaa bhi anubhav hua
 The rules made by him for that shop were oral, as their written format could not challenge the members of the committee who did not repay the loan
 phir jaisaa kii tay tha, havarth ko us prayaas main baari nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 pehali kaa-aaparative shaap bamushkil do varsh hi chal pai
 baari ghate ke kaaran use band kar dena padaa
 Due to the failure of the plan, people made fun of Howarth
 dukandaaron kaa karj lautaane main usko kaaphi nuksaan bhi hua tha
 If there was someone else, he would probably never try to repeat that effort again
 Even forgetting does not take the name of organization and cooperation
 But Howarth was rich in resolve
 samaaj ko badalane ke liye kritasankalp! pehali kaa-aperitav shaap band ho jane kaa use dukh tha; or gaharaa kshobh bhi
 udhar rosemara kii vastuon main baari milavati se mazdooron main anek bimaariyaan badhati ja rahi thim
 The government was supportive of the bourgeoisie, so it was meaningless to expect anything from it
 aise main ek aise upabhokta bhandar kii atyant aavashyaktaa thi, jahaan par mazdooron ko khaane-pine kii vasteen shuddh evam upyukt mulya par praapt ho saken
 uskaa pichhlaa prayog asafal ho chukaa tha
 How to start a new beginning, he would stay in this thinking day and night
 He was neither ready to suffer a loss again, nor was he going to support in that state
 mitragan bhi tab tak saath dene se bachate, jab tak laabh kii sunishchitata na ho
 He thought that such a system should be made so that the members continue to get benefits in proportion to the money spent by them
 He also decided that he would avoid repeating past mistakes
 But what should be the way, there should not be any mistakes again, what measures should be taken for this, this problem kept churning him day and night
 or phir sachmuch swapndrushtaa havarth ko ek raat sapane se hi raah mili
 ek raat havarth der tak jaagaa
 chintaa ke kaaran usko neend aa hi nahin rahi thi
 He wanted to advance cooperative efforts
 ‘das ghanta adhinium’ ke viruddh andolan karte samay kuch nae saathi bane the
 They were ready to support him, but he used to get upset at the prospect of loss again
 laabh kii sunishchitata ko badhaane kii koi bhi yukti uski samaj main nahin aa rahi thi
 But it was amazing that night
 vah achaanak uth kar baith gaya
 The wife was sleeping evenly
 usase lagbhag bekhbar, apane hi ek purakhe archimides kii bhaanti nae vichaar ke swaagat main havarth chillaaya— 'I found it
 

maine hal dhund liya
 '8 havarth ke sapane main uske athis saathi or sammilit ho gaye
 Each decided that they would deposit at least two pence per week
 All of them had a struggling life
 isliye prati saptaah do pans juta paanaa bhi unke liye aasaan nahin tha
 Some colleagues remember his previous failure
 unhen lagata tha ki yadi nayaa prayaas bhi asafal hua to isse unki maamuli jamaapunji kaa nuksaan sambhav he
 That is why Howarth faced his initial opposition and non-cooperation
 At such a time, Howarth resorted to shrewdness and politics
 usne do pans prati saptaah agrim raashi dene ke liye prabandhakon par dabaav daalana prarambh kar diya, jiske puraa na hone par usne hadtaal or kaam chhodkar jane kii dhamkee dena shuru kar diya
 do pence advance maamuli rakam thi
 For that, the factory owners did not want to invite the strike
 parinaam yah hua ki kai kaarkaane kamgaaron ke samarthan main aa gaye
 It is said that where there is a will, there is a way
 Where there is determination there is success
 In some days the group deposits reached twenty-eight pounds
 rakam bahut zyada nahin thi
 But it was enough that with that they could try to color in another dream of theirs
 charles havarth ko apane pichley anubhav kii yaad thi
 Along with the weaknesses of the previous system
 In view of his experience, he was entrusted with the responsibility of preparing the rules of the new committee on behalf of the members
 havarth ne us daayitv kaa bhalee-bhaanti nirvahan kiya
 With no written rules of the previous organization, it was difficult to compel members to follow the rules
 is baar havarth ne samiti ke gathan se purv hi ek vistrut niyamavali taiyaar kii thi, jisko 24 oktober 1944 ko panjiyak frandli ko-aaparative socity ke karyaalay se panjikrut bhi kara liya gaya
 The new committee was named — 'roshdale Equiteville Pioneers Society'
 pichley anubhavon ke sabak lete hue havarth ne samiti ke upabhokta bhandar se kii gai kharid ke anupaat main sadasyon ko nakad labhaansh dene kaa praavdhaan kiya tha, jise baad main banane vaali sabhi sahakaari samitiyon main ek aadharsiddhant ke rup main manyata mili
 uske dwaara samiti ke vidhaan main kii gai nai vyavasthaaen aage chalakar sahakaarita andolan kii ridh baniin
 havarth ke nikat sahyogi, mitra or samiti ke mahatvapurn sadsy, wiliam kupar ne bhi mana ki sadasyon ke bich laabh ke vibhaajan kaa vichaar havarth kii hi dein tha
 He was born in 1814
 uske mitra pyaar se usko ‘di lair’ kaha karte the
 He was also a lifelong member of the Wholesale Consumer Society
 uski sevaaon ko dekhte hue baad main use is samiti kaa adhyaksh bhi banaaya gaya
 However, Howarth's hard work was successful and the work of the Rochedale Pioneers went on
 When he died on 25 June 1868, the cooperative movement was sweeping across Europe
 use hewood naamak sthaan par dafnaaya gaya
 Paying tribute to Howarth's death, William Cooper said- ‘apane jivan main vah dusron ke sadaiv kaam aanevaala atisamvedansheel naagarik, dharm ke maamle main sarvatha mukt vichaarak, saamaajik tathaa raajnneetik sarokaaron ke samay satat pragatisheel tathaa lokkalyaan ke liye lagaataar kaam karne vaala ek mahaan samaaj sudhaarak tha
 He was a good husband and father, a true and friendly friend
 ’9 James Standing also worked in the muslin factory
 vah pragatisheel vichaaron ko maanane vaala, ek sakriy saamaajik kaaryakarta tha
 He was always devoted to improving the economic social condition of the workers
 rabart oven ke kaaryon ke prashansak james kaa maananaa tha ki uski tarah duusare udhyamiyon ko bhi shramik-kalyaan ke kaaryon ke liye khulkar saamne aana chahie
 usamen netritv kii kshamta thi or vah shramikon ko apane adhikaar ke liye sangharsh karne ke liye satat prerit karata rahata tha
 When workers started the movement in favor of the 'ten Hour Act' to reduce daily workloads in factories in Rochedale, James not only openly supported the movement, but also led his agitators to the post of secretary Also participated loudly
 1843-44 ke bich shramikon ne agrim vetan ke bhugtan ke paksh main hadtaal kii to vah ek baar phir unke samarthan main utar aayaa, haalanki is baar vah hadtaal lagbhag asafal siddh hui thi
 Meanwhile, James came to know about the amendments made by the Government in the Societies Registration Act
 He immediately asked for a study of the Friendly Society Act and studied it
 usko laga ki mazdooron ko sangathit karne, unke adhikaron kii raksha tathaa unke liye kalyaan-kaarykram prarambh karne kii disha main vah adhinium upyogi ho saktaa he
 James Stendridge was at the forefront of the workers' motivations for the formation of the Rochedale Equitable Pioneers Society
 samiti kaa gathan hua to james kaa naam bhi athis sansthaapak sadasyon main sammilit tha
 William Cooper, one of the founding members of the committee, was born in 1822
 samiti dwaara upabhokta bhandar prarambh kiya gaya to uskaa khanjachi wiliam kupar ko hi banaaya gaya
 In addition, his task was to take care of the records of the committee
 samiti se judane se pehle vah handloom ke kaarkaane main bunakar kaa kaam karata tha
 As a member of the committee, he was entrusted with the responsibility of preparing accounts
 jisko usne acchhee tarah se nibhaayaa
 iskaa usko laabh mila
 aage chalakar jab koaparative holcel socity aarambh kii gai to kupar ko hi uskaa adhyaksh chunaa gaya
 The task of the Cooperative Wholesale Society was to provide goods to the consumer stores operating at the cooperative level
 yah samitiyaan sidhe utpaadak se vasteen kharidkar unhen sahakaari upabhokta bhandaron tak pahunchane kaa kaary karti thim
 This led to the producers not having to wander to the market for their products, while the stores of the committee also made the goods available at relatively cheaper rates
 rabart oven tathaa wiliam king ke vichaaron se prabhavit kupar kii sahakaar ke vichaaron main bahut aasthaa thi
 Like Greenwood, Cooper also had ambitions
 vah bhi mehnatee tathaa adwitiya pratibha kaa dhani tha
 He worked on many levels to spread ideas related to cooperative and socialism
 Coopers were the driving force behind the formation of the Co-operative Wholesale Society
 uske is prayaas se sahakaari samitiyon ke kaary ko sangathit karne kii disha main madad mili
 kyonki sthaan-sthaan par teji se khulte ja rahe upabhokta bhandaron ke liye sambhav na tha ki ve sidhe utpaadakon se maal mangava saken
 unke is kaary ko koaparative holcel samitiyaan sulabh bana detii thim
 This led to attraction among producers towards cooperatives
 duusare bazaar kii samasya kam hone se un chote utpaadakon ko bhi aage badhane kaa avasar mila jo abhi tak bade utpaadakon ke saamne bazaar main tik nahin paa rahe the
 After the assurance of consumption of other manufactured goods, people were also coming forward in the field of productivity through cooperative groups, which had never been possible before that
 iske atirikt kupar ne sahakaari beemaa samiti ke gathan main bhi bad-chadhakar hissaa liya
 In addition, he also contributed valuablely in the establishment of the Cooperative Workers' Committee
 kupar ko sahakaarita ke saidhantik paksh kaa bhi paryaapt gyaan tha
 He also composed a book, demonstrating his hold on the subject and his experience
 The title of that book is - History of the Rosdale District Corn Mill '
 This book is an ideal means of understanding the condition of the workers in the factories of the then England
 usase yah bhi pataa chalata he ki audyogikeekaran kaa vah daur kitna avyavasthit evam shramik-virdohi tha
 William Cooper died on 31 March 1868, at that time he was only forty-six years old
 wiliam kupar ko ridhanjali dete hue sahakaarita ke mukhya samachaarpatr ‘di ko-operator’ ne likhaa ki— It was not her death as it appeared
 balki vah pavitra jivan kii ore baha le jane vaali divya shwans thi
 It is an attempt by a human to establish his independent identity in the great city of the gods, even though ordinary people like us keep calling him death
 ’10 Among the few respected humans born in the world who have done big things in a small life, William Cooper is one of those respected
 mills eshwarth vyavsaay se bunakar mills eshwarth kii oven evam louis blank ke vichaaron main puri aasthaa thi
 But politically he was a chartist and had proficiency in organization work
 roshadel equitevil pynirs socity kaa sadsy banane se pehle usne kuch dinon tak ek kaarkaane main chaikidaar kii naukari bhi kii thi
 He was at the forefront of encouraging the people to form the committee
 isliye samiti ke gathan ke samay pehla adhyaksh mills eshwarth ko hi banaaya gaya
 He duly discharged his obligation
 samiti kaa hi ek or sadsy semual eshwarth, mills kaa hi betaa tha
 Mills Ashworth died on 13 April 1868, at the time he was 76 years old
 mills ko roshadel pynirs ke kabristaan main dafnaaya gaya tha
 It is not possible for the cooperative sector to forget its contribution
 apane saathiyon kii bhaanti james smith bhi oon chhaantane ke kaarkaane main naukari karata tha
 He was a socialist thinker who had dreams of radical changes in his eyes day and night
 bahumukhi pratibha kaa dhani smith mehnatee bhi khub tha
 During the formation of the Rochedale Pioneers, Smith was paramount among the members who joined him, creating a passion for companionship in his mind
 isliye samiti ke gathan ke samay se hi usko mahatvapurn bhoomikaayen saunpi jaati raheen
 vah samiti ke kaary main raat-din juta rahata tha
 In view of his services, he was entrusted with the responsibility of important posts like Director, President, General Secretary, Trustee, which he performed well
 sadasyon ke bich sahakaar kii bhaavana jagaane or shanti evam sauhaard kaayam karne ke liye satat kaaryshil rahane vaale james smith kii mrityu maatr 50 varsh kii avasthaa main, 27 may 1869 ko hui
 usko roshadel ke karbistan main dafnaaya gaya
 James Smith's diligence was a major contributor to the unpredictable success of Rochelle's consumer stores in the early years of its inception
 vidambnaa yah he ki jis andolan kii neenv jamaane main smith kaa haath tha, uski safalataa ke bahut kam aayam vah apane chote-se jivan main dekh sakaa
 baavjood iske praarambhik roshadel pynirs ke sansthaapak sadasyon main uskaa yogadan avismaraneey tha
 The aircraft was a very minor person
 pheri lagaakar maal bechney vaala
 garib or sidhaa-sada
 raajnneeti main uski jaraa bhi ruchi nahin thi
 Despite this, he was a skilled speaker and he used to know how to impress people
 uskaa gyaan bahuaiami tha
 People often used to come to meet him
 us samay ve usase sthaneey masalon ke alaava dharm, raajnneeti tathaa saamaajik muddon par charchaa karte the
 He used to sit and talk among them till late night
 uski batakahi kaa jaadu ki log apni bhukh-pyaas sabakuch bhula dete the
 Like a seasoned scholar, Scracraft tries to solve every curiosity of the people sitting in his company
 Sometimes the matter even reached the debate
 kai baar dharmik manyataon par charchaa prarambh ho jaati thi
 The aircraft had a serious critical eye, often vocal during religious discussions
 vah dharm main aadambarwaad kaa ghor virdohi tha
 Therefore, during religious discussions, he often began to unravel the fanaticism of the church
 us samay vahaan par upasthit dharmik rup se aasthavan vyakti lambii-lambii bahason par bhi utar aate the
 But the scriptural knowledge of religion was philosophical
 vah apane aalochakon kii har baat kaa taarkik uttar dene kaa prayaas karata
 is tarah kii bahason main usko haraa paanaa asambhav tha
 Being truly humanistic, theological interpretations of thecraft were in favor of the masses
 jin logon ke bich vah rah rahaa tha, unhen isi prakaar ke jaadui netritv kii aavashyaktaa thi
 In fact, his ideology was compatible with humanism
 isliye vah paas aae logon ke saath der tak bahes kar saktaa tha
 John Collier was probably the most well-educated member among the first twenty-eight
 vah samaajawaadee vichaardhaara main aasthaa rakhane vaala ek prashikshit ejeeniyar tha
 Collier's grandfather, John Collier himself, was a very good writer
 ve roshadel ke nikatavarti sthaan milanro ke rahane vaala, lagbhag batooni vyakti the
 He had a good intervention in both prose and poetry
 1744 tathaa 1750 ke bich unhone kai pustakon kii rachana kii thi
 His style was sarcastic
 jiskaa asar lanbaa hota tha
 People used to draw towards him - both men and women
 He died in 1786
 unke mazaakia swabhaav kaa anumaan is kavita se lagaaya ja saktaa he, jo unhone apni mrityu ke maatr das minute pehle likhi thi
 The poem of his death was carved on his grave as his tombstone
 The meaning of the poem is - 'here i am lying with my little poem
 uske saath gaal se gaal sataae hue
 chankiye mat ki unke bich gaharaa samjhauta ho chukaa he
 Now Jan does not need any syrup, nor does his girlfriend have tea 
'11 Jan Kalier was influenced by his grandfather's ideology
 samaajwaad ke prati apni aasthaa ke hi kaaran vah roshadel pynirs ke sampark main aayaa
 Like Dada, John Collier was also rich in wonderful speech art
 roshadel pynirs dwaara upabhokta bhandar kii sthapana se lekar uske aage ke pragati abhiyaanon main jaan kaliyar kaa yogadan atyant bahumoolya tha
 He died on 24 November 1883
 He was 75 at the time
 usko roshadel kii kabrgah main hi dafnaaya gaya
 David Brook was a black painter by profession and a chartist by ideology
 yahaan ham bataa den ki england main 1830 se lekar 1840 ke bich raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon kaa ek sanghathan andolnarat tha
 The demands of the workers associated with the organization were in line with modern democratic principles
 ve satta main sabhi kii saajhedaari kii maang kar rahe the
 His first demand was that every citizen should have the right to go to Parliament on the basis of valid voting
 Initially, this demand was very exasperated by the government
 parinamswaroop anek chartist ko sajaa kaatane ke liye austrailia bhej diya gaya tha
 The demand of 'chartistas' agitators later got the support of the pro-freedom thinkers like John Stuart Mill etc
, so that the movement could move forward with new name and new name
 david brooke eemaandaar tathaa utsaahi kaaryakarta tha
 In view of his hard work and dedication, he was entrusted with the responsibility of purchasing goods for the consumer stores of the committee
 vah ek jimmedaari kaa kaam tha
 Especially in those early days when the consumer stores were ridiculed by the people associated with it as 'weavers shop'
 maal kii kharid ke liye brooke ko jagah-jagah janaa padataa tha
 There shopkeepers and producers etc
 used to make fun of the booke, trying to discourage it
 brooke bina aapa khoye dhairyapurvak apane kaam main laga rahata tha
 Brook believed in socialist ideology and wanted the working class to be self-reliant and to develop only through hard work, without anyone's grace
 vah apni thik-thaak naukari chhodkar samiti ke saath judaa tha or kahin bhi saat se aath shilling pratidin bahut aasaani se kama saktaa tha
 But the work of the Rochedale Pioneers accepted it only for his complacency, saying that until the committee was able to pay each of its members at a rate of at least three pennies per hour, it would be free of any monetary benefit
 Will continue to provide services
 He served on the committee for many years
 For five years he remained the office chairman of the Purchasing Department in the Consumables Store of Rochedale Pioneers
 He spent his entire life amidst severe economic deprivation
 brooke kaa nidhan 79 varsh kii avasthaa main, 24 navambar 1882 ko hua
 But like those beautiful, stylish and fragile flowers that are cursed to be lost in the darkness of oblivion, the work that Brooks did to maintain the committee's success and mutual harmony and sociality among the members was almost forgotten
 12 Abraham Greenwood, like Charles Howarth, was also associated with the weaver family
 uskaa janm 1824 main hua tha
 Father used to make blankets
 swayan greenwood ne bhi chhabis varshon tak oon kii chantai kaa kaary kiya tha
 He had been the secretary of the Charter Association for many years
 1848 main roshadel pynirs se judane se pehle vah ‘pipuls institute’ main puskalayadhyaksh tha
 He was influenced by the work of William King and Robert Owen
 unheen ke sampark main aane se sahakaari andolan main uski aasthaa jaagi thi
 Therefore, while joining the Rochedale Pioneers, he worked diligently to expand the cooperative
 greenwood kii adhyaapan main ruchi thi, isiilie samiti dwaara pradutt dayitvon ke atirikt vah baaki sadasyon ko padhaane main bhi ruchi letaa tha
 One day at the end of the week he worked to teach the members of the committee
 raajnneeti arthshaastra se uskaa vishesh lagaav tha
 Abraham Greenwood's active affection for merit and co-operation led him to become one of the founding members of the Rosdale Society of Ecuataville Pioneers
 samiti ke sadsy ke rup main greenwood ne saunpe gaye dayitvon kaa nirvaah puri lagn evam eemaandaaree se kiya
 Through it, the committee successfully completed many of its expansion plans
 isliye aage chalakar jab kanjumor holcel socity kii sthapana kii gai to uski adhyakshata ke liye greenwood ko hi chunaa gaya
 He was also the founder and president of Rochedale Corn Mill
 Between 1874 and 1898, he also served as the cashier and manager of the Rochedale Wholesale Society
 in sari jimmedaariyon ko sambhalakar greenwood ne sahakaarita ke vichaaron ke prati nishtha ke saath apni prabandhan kshamta kaa bhi parichay diya tha
 That is why, within the committee, more than one, important responsibilities were assigned to him
 Later, when Rosdale Pioneers entered the field of insurance business, Greenwood was unanimously assigned the reins of the insurance company
 usko navgathit beemaa company kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 He started a communication service called Sahakari Samachar in order to spread the idea and principles of cooperatives to the common man and motivate people towards him 
 usne ko-aaparative news seva ke adhyaksh kaa daayitv bhi sambhala
 vah pachis varshon tak news paper socity kaa adhyaksh bhi rahaa
 us pad par rahete hue bhi usne sahakaarita andolan ko aage le jane kaa kaary kiya
 Greenwood believed in socialist ideology
 lokkalyaan evam samajaseva se jude kaaryon main uskaa man lagata tha
 He died in 1911
 If the cooperative movement is able to establish its identity on the globe, then dedicated co-operators like Greenwood have also contributed heavily behind it
 jaan hilton, wiliam kupar kii bhaanti haalanki roshadel pynirs ke sansthaapak sadasyon main se nahin tha
 But his contribution to those who popularized the socialist-hedonistic ideology is unforgettable
 uskaa janm san 1824 isvi main hua tha
 He was a committed thinker and a movement worker in favor of radical change in the society
 mazdooron par uskaa prabhaav tha
 He was constantly trying to diagnose their problems
 isiilie 1864 main jab roshadel holcel ko-aaparative socity prarambh kii gai to jaan hilton ko uski sadsyta ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 John Hilton happily fulfilled his obligation
 He was also a founding member of the Medilton and Leg Society
 He was a successful writer
 vah poonjeevaad ke badhate varchasv ko saamanyajan ke hiton ke pratikul maanata tha
 Especially his ideology of capitalism, on the basis of which he treats man as just a commodity, whose usefulness is determined by the consumption of other commodities
 apane lekhon main hilton is poonjivadi pravriti kaa jamkar virodh kiya tha
 His ideology matched that of Marxists
 1899 main jab uski mrityu hui tab tak sahakaarita kaa vichaar bahut aage bad chukaa tha
 By the seventeenth century, capitalism had taken root in England
 uske kaaran vahaan kii arthvyavastha main tej oochaal aayaa tha
 But at the same time many problems were also arising
 unamem ek to berogari kii samasya thi
 The machines took away work from the quality craftsmen and forced them to wander from rate to rate
 duusari badi samasya thi majudaron ke shoshan kii
 maalik log kam se kam mazdooree ke badale jitod mehnat karana chaahate the
 All his laws had the same intention - exploitation, exploitation and exploitation, maximum public exploitation
 Dr
 worried about the ill effects of capitalism
 William King wrote of it as a social evil- ‘is vyaadhi se bachaa ja saktaa he, upachaar hamaare haathon main he or vah upachaar he—sahakaarita
13 When there was exploitation and incest then the reaction against him was also natural
 virodh ke swar 1830 se uthne prarambh hue the, kintu poonjeevaad kaa pehla sangathit virodh chartist andolankariyon kii ore se hua
 The Chartist agitators were actually from the educated and employed class, who felt themselves hurt and neglected in the then system
 is andolan kaa namakaran wiliam lovet dwaara 1838 main ek naagarik adhikaarptr jari karne ke saath hua tha
 Chartist agitators were advocates of economic-political equality and democracy
 apane naagarik adhikaarptr main unhone jansamanya ko matdaan kaa adhikaar die jane, matdaan kshetren ke ekasmaan bantwaare, nirvaachit sadan, vyaktigat sampatti kaa unmoolan, ummidavaaron ke liye nunatam shiksha nirdhaarit karne, sabhi ko chunaav ladane kaa adhikaar dene jaise kai maangen kii thim
 The agitators tried unsuccessfully to pressure the British government through nationwide strikes led by o'connor
 tab sarkaar daman par utar ai
 anek chartist andolankariyon ko astealiya main kaid kar liya gaya
 Chartist agitators had to face defeat in cases against the government
 Finally in 1848, the movement started dying
 san 1830 main hi aarthik aatmanirbharta ke madhyam se jansadharan kaa sammaan waapas laane kaa prayaas sahyogi udhyamon ke madhyam se ho chukaa tha
 But the lack of experience and awareness led to the failure of the first cooperative society, the Rochedale Friendly Co-operative Society, formed in 1830 by Howarth and his associates
 The first experience itself was bitter
 aise main is baat kii sambhaavna kam hi thi ki dubaara phir usee prakaar kaa kadam uthaaya jaataa
 lekin jaisaa ki pehle kii kaha ja chukaa he, poonjeevaad ke dushprabhavon ke chalate mazdooron kii haalat bahut kharaab ho chali thi
 One way of getting rid of the troubles in life was becoming increasingly difficult, it could also be migrated from life with problems
 If it were so, time would have been damned to them
 History was often deprived of the greatest achievement of the nineteenth century
 aisa sachmuch ho jaataa to jivan main sambhaavnaaon kii upasthiti or unki chamatkaarik dein se logon kaa bharosa hi uth jaataa
 lekin aage jo hua vah sambhaavnaaon se bhi ekadam pare, akalpit or apratyaashit tha
 For this, there was a lot in the history of humanity to inspire, guide and encourage them
 america ke shiker saahcharyavaadiyon kaa ek geet he— 'whoever wants to reach the highest peak should first look at the person at the bottom
 And then the person at the bottom should start with the climb to reach the highest peak 
'14 pehali samiti apni vyavasthaagat kamajoriyon tathaa kanoonee shithilataaon ke kaaran asafal hui thi
 The main reasons among these were the provision of credit sale and ambiguity of rules
 In view of the pathetic economic condition of the workers, according to the arrangement made, the members were given a week's loan from the consumer reserves of the committee
 unase yah apeksha kii jaati thi ki saptaah ke ant main udhaar kii rakam kaa bhugtan kar denge
 is vyavastha ke peeche paryaapt tark bhi the
 Because members used to receive salaries at the end of the week
 kintu vyaavhaarik rup main yah vyavastha bahut dinon tak nahin chal pai
 paristhitiyon ke chalate saptaah ke ant main bhugtan kii vaapasi apeksha se bahut kam ho chali thi
 Due to ambiguity of the rules, it was not beneficial to challenge the member guilty in court for non-payment of loan in such cases
 parinaam yah hua ki samiti ko vyapaar main ghaataa hone laga
 uskaa bahut-sa dhan udhaar main dub gaya
 Howarth suffered a lot in person
 The committee disbanded after a few days
 us samay to kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki itnaa nuksaan uthaane ke pashchaat havarth yaa uske saathi dubaara vaisaa hi prayaas karne par vichaar karenge
 lekin bheeshan garibi tathaa bazaar ke maahaul ne unhen dubaara vaisaa sochane par vivash kar diya
 yaa kahen ki unke saamne ‘karo yaa maro’ kii sthiti thi
 There was another increase in inflation in the market, adulteration from above
 There was no end to the plight of the workers
 1843 kii garmiyon kii baat he
 Renowned novelist Charles Dickens, who was a 31-year-old Sudarshan youth in those days, set out on a trip to Lancashire
 The aim was to gather experience
 Wanted to see how common life is there in North England, which is earning worldwide name in the field of industry
 unhone menchester kii majdoor bastiyon kii yaatr kii, yah jaanane ke liye ki apane maalikon ke liye saal main karodon pound kaa munafa kamaane vaali kapadaa milon ke majdoor kin paristhitiyon main rahete hai
 What Dickens saw there was going to numb the body even to the soul
 majdoor bastiyon main bhukh evam garibi ke nange naanch ne dicens ko hatprabh kar diya
 unhone dekha ki audyogic kranti kaa hriday-pradesh maane jane vaale us kshetra main jivan kitna mushkil or amanviya he
 As if the whole of England has been divided into two parts
 On one side there is the England of big Dhananeths, capitalists, industrialists and earning bureaucrats, on the other side there is a house of hungry, naked, poor and sick women and men
 agle hi din athenyim club main naukarshahon tathaa kaarkaana maalikon kii upasthiti main unhone vahaan upasthit mazdooron kaa awahn karte hue kaha ki unhen apni is agyanta or aparaadh-granthi se baahar aa janaa chahie ki ve garibi or aparaadh ke bevas janmdata hai
 He had also appealed to the bureaucrats and factory owners to exchange mutual duties and responsibilities to improve the condition of the workers
 majdoor bastiyon main chhaayi garibi ne dicens ko itnaa vyathit kar diya tha ki train dwaara landan waapas lautate hue unhone apni pustak ‘di christmas carol’ kii abhiklpana kii
 ek saptaah baad hi unhone vah pustak likhni prarambh kar di
 uske lagbhag chah maheene ke baad, disambar 19, 1843 ko vah pustak prakashit hokar ai, jisane puure england ke buddhijiviyon ko jhakzor kar rakh diya
 log mazdooron kii sthiti ke bare main sochane ko vivash ho uthe— 'christmas had never been like that before' Thompson writes about that situation
 landan lautne ke baad charles dicens ne apane aankh, naak tathaa kaan yah jaanane par laga die the ki menchester or lankashair kii majdoor bastiyon ke utthan ke liye puunjipati or sarkaar kitne chintit hai tathaa majdoor apane shoshan evam utpeedan kaa kitna or kis tarah sakaaratmak virodh kar pate hai
 Charles Dickens's first work, 'the Christmas Carol', was almost a biography
 usamen dicans ne yah kalpana ki thi ek pita apni garibi se behad tang aa chukaa he
 He is irked and distressed towards his family even while serving a sentence for not paying the debt
 upanyaas kaa mukhya paatr bab cresti naam ke atyant garib majdoor ko banaaya gaya tha, jo apane maalik ke liye kamartod parishram karata he, phir bhi vah apane parivaar kaa bharan-poshan kathinyeepurvak hi kar paata he
 Bab has a son named Tim, who is very ill and unable to walk
 bab kaa maalik dhani scruj he, had se zyada kanjus
 uske jivan kaa mukhya lakshya apane liye adhik se adhik dhan ikattha karnaa he
 He does not care at all about the hungry-sick laborers and their families, whose hard work spurs gold on his factory
 pustak ke bahaane dicens dwaara gadha gaya roopak teji se badalte british samaaj par tikhaa kataaksh tha, jiskaa ek sira behad chamakdaar or chakachaindh se yukt tha, usapar mutthi-bhar logon kaa adhipaty tha
 While at the other end there were thousands of millions of oppressed-exploited people, longing for the minor features of life
 Karl Marx used to call this class as proletarian
 kadi mehnat ke baavjood unhen na bharpayt roti milti thi, na tan dhakne ko kapadaa
 pustak ke bahaane lekhak ne majdoor jivan kii visangatiyon ko puri duniya ke saamne laane kaa prayaas kiya tha, jisamen unhen bharpoor kamyaabi praapt hui
 dicens kii yah pustak aage chalakar saamaajik adhyayan ke liye pramukh dastavej bani
 usase teji se ubharate audyogic samaaj kii visangatiyaan logon ke saamne aane lageen
 dicens dwaara gadha gaya paatr bab cresti samaaj ke garib, ringrast, utpeedit or shoshit majdoor kaa pratik ban gaya tathaa kutil scruj ko kanjusee kaa paryaay maan liya gaya
 Accumulated resentment towards bosses like Scrooge in the public mind started getting vocal expression
 Along with this, another main thing started to make the workers understand that they or their fate is not responsible for their well being and plight, but their system that gives the opportunity to imprison the capital in limited hands
 ve samajhane lage ki is avasthaa se ubharne ke liye unhen swayan hi prayaas karne honge
 Even before Dickens' visit to Manchester, a group of Babb Cresties had been having regular meetings with their families at Roshdale, just seventeen kilometers from there, to get rid of their problems
 baithkon main mazdooron kii samasyaon tathaa unase mukti ke bare main vichaar hota tha
 At the same meeting, one day Jan Karsav suggested the formation of a cooperative society
 The assembly also agreed to that suggestion
 yah 1843 kii sardiyon kii baat he
 Another meeting was held to consider Bab's proposal, that meeting just a few days before Christmas at the address of Beavers Arms, Cheetam Street, near Todd Lane in Rochedale
 All the people present in the meeting decided unanimously that it is better to bear the grief of waiting for the compassion of the factory owners, that efforts should be started on the basis of our own discretion and labor
 The bourgeoisie will come forward to help, this belief of the workers was broken at some time
 us sabha main sahakaari samiti banane ke nirnay ko anumati mil gai
 Its main purpose was designed to supply pure, pure whole goods to customers
 It was the day of 15 August 1844
 baaki dinon se kahin adhik pavitra or ummiido se bharaa hua
 It was a different matter to talk about cooperative society, to pursue its idea, it was different to manage capital for it
 But wherever there is a will, there is a way
 The workers decided during the meeting that every worker who wants to become a member of the committee, must invest a minimum of one dollar in the fund of the committee
 The amount of dollars was too big for the laborers who worked diligently for each penny
 tab yah suzav bhi aayaa ki iske liye kaarkaana maalikon se udhaar liya jaae
 jo udhaar dene main anakani karen, unhen hadtaal yaa dharna-pradarshan ke madhyam se advance dene ke liye vivash kiya jaae
 us samay jo sadsygan kaam karen ve yah prayaas bhi karen ki hadtaal par gaye sadasyon ke hisse ke pans bhi bachaa saken
 hadtaal kii dhamkee milane par kuch kaarkaana maalik advance dene ko sahamat ho gaye
 But some refused completely
 There was also a conflict between the workers and the workers
 isapar kuch majdoor niraash hokar samiti ke prastaav se peeche hatane lage
 kuch abhi bhi ummid baandhe rahe
 prayek saptaah do pans kii rakam lakshya ko dekhte hue paryaapt nahin thi
 Although some factory owners were willing to pay that amount in advance, some had completely rejected this demand
 aakhir mazdooron tathaa maalikon ke bich yah samjhauta ho sakaa ki utani rakam maalikon kii ore se majdoor sanghathan ko advance ke rup di jaaegi
 jahaan se sadsy us raashi ko udhaar ke rup main grahan kar sakate hai
 16 do pence kii rakam us samay athiktar kamgaaron kii lagbhag do saptaah kii mazdooree ke baraabar thi
 It can be said that the amount was not even modest for those weavers
 ise ugaahne ke liye teen vyakti niyukt kiye gaye, jo prayek somvaar sadasyon se rakam laakar khajaanji ke paas jamaa kar dete the
 Looking at the situation, it seemed difficult to raise one pound of share funds
 sadsy prati saptaah do pans jamaa karne main bhi naakaam ho rahe the
 There have also been occasions when disappointment started dominating the members
 us samay yah vichaar bhi aayaa ki samiti ke gathan kaa vichaar philhal sthagit kar diya jaae tathaa vikaas ke vaikalpik upayon ke bare main sochaa jaae
 saath hi abhi tak jamaa kii gai rakam, uske sadasyon ko lautaa di jaae
 kuch sadsy to hataash hokar us samay tak jamaa karai gai share-nidhi waapas bhi maangane lage the
 17 This was an adverse situation
 lekin ummiido evam ghani niraashaaon ke bich mazdooron kaa sangharsh chalata rahaa
 is bich charles havarth bina samay khoe teji se samiti ke liye vidhaan kii rachana main laga tha
 The first stop for that small group, amidst the adverse conditions and frustration, came on 24 October 1844, when the rules made by Howarth were registered by the Registrar of Family Societies, making that arrangement of rules an autonomous under the Act of Parliament The identity of the organization was given
 is prakaar roshadel koaparative equitewal socity kii neenv rakhi gai
 Which heralded the co-operative movement in England which spread throughout the world in a few years
 aage chalakar sahakaarita andolan main nae sudhaar hue
 nae-nae vichaar bhi aae
 magar uski mul bhaavana vahi rahi, jo un bunakaron dwaara pehali sahakaari samiti ke gathan ke samay darshaayi gai thi
 And thus by December the Rochedale Pioneers managed to collect an initial capital of £ 28
 upabhokta bhandar ke liye samiti ne tod len sthit ek puraani mil ke maalik mistar danlap se baat kii
 mil haalanki varshon pehle band hokar khandhar main badalane lagi thi
 However, he was not ready to hire any committee
 antat ek upaay nikaala
 samiti ke hi ek sthaayee sadsy ke naam par us godaam ke bhootal sthit 23 foot chaide tathaa 50 foot lambey sthaan ko teen varsh ke liye kiraaye par likhva liya gaya
 The rent was kept — ten pounds per year
 Later, the next part of that place, 23 feet wide and seventeen feet deep, was used as a shop
 shesh sthaan ko bhandar tathaa meeting aadi ke upyog ke chhod diya gaya
 The question here may be that why did the first unit of the cooperative, which later displayed its utility in many fields like industry, trade, service, culture, welfare, etc
, started through consumer stores? Other problems of workers were also serious at that time
 sahakaarita andolan ke vistaar evam uski pravriti ke bare main vishisht charchaa to aage kii jaaegi
 yahaan yah bataa dena hi paryaapt hoga ki vibhinn deshon main sahakaarita kaa vistaar un deshon kii saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik sthitiyon ke anusaar hi hua
 In other words, once the utility was proved, different countries, societies used cooperatives in their own way, according to their needs
 lekin thode-bahut parivartan ke baavjood unka vidhaan roshadel pynirs se prerit hi rahaa
 yah baat bhi drushtavy he ki swayan roshadel equitevil pynirs socity kii niyamavali kaa mukhya dhaancha se prerit-prabhavit tha
 Minor changes were made to it by 18 Rochedale Pioneers
 utpaadakta sahakaarita aarambh karne ke peeche mukhya kaaran to yah tha ki jansadharan dukandaaron kii manamaani or unke dwaara khadyapadaarthon main kii jane vaali milawat se pareshaan tha
 That is why consumer stores were more likely to get success among laborers
 duusare simit puunji dwaara ve udyogpatiyon ko chunauti dene main samarth hi nahin the
 The fundamental idea of howarth was the division of profit into the proportion of goods purchased
 vahi aage chalakar sahakaarita ke prasar main sahaayak bana
 isliye samiti ke vidhaan main laabh ke nyaayik bantwaare kaa vishad ullekh kiya gaya tha
 However, behind the beginning of its consumer reserves, the desire of the Rochedale Pioneers to earn economic benefits was secondary
 vastutah garibi, kuposhan or bekaari ke atirikt mazdooron kii mukhya samasya thi—ghatiya, milawat-yukt khaadya samragi kii uplabdhta, vah bhi oune-paune daamon main
 spasht he ki roshadel ke un majdoor bunakaron ne apni rosemara kii pareshaaniyon se mukti ke upaay ke rup main sahakaarita ko chunaa tha
 Through the Committee— ‘unka taatkaalik lakshya tha—uchit mulya par shreshthatar gunvattta ke bhojya-padaarthon kii uplabdhta, saath hi kuch rojgaar tathaa sahakaari prayaason dwaara hone vaale laabh ke madhyam se ek samudayik ikai kii sthapana, jahaan par rahane or kaam karne kii sthitiyaan apekshaakrit behatar hon
 duusare shabdon main ve ek shaitani mil ke bheetar apane liye nae tirth kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate the
 '19 samiti ke sadasyon main charles havarth aadi kuch to puraani roshadel frandli ko-aaparative samiti ke sadsy rah chuke the, jabaki kuch sadsy da
 wiliam king ke samachar patr ‘di ko-operator’ ke prabhaav se usase jude the
 Some were associated with each other from the Chartist movement itself, while some were interlinked during the prohibition movements
 ye sabhi apni parivartankaree nishtha ke kaaran samiti ke sampark main aae the
 According to the profession, they included those related to various occupations, such as tailors, cobblers, joiners, cabinet makers, engineers, etc
 tathaapi unamem aadhe se adhik sadsy kapadaa udyog se jude saadhaaran karigar the
 They all went through almost identical situations, so their problems were the same
 iske aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki un athis sadasyon main na keval ekta evam samarpan kaa bhav tha, balki apane lakshya ke liye puri nishtha evam tyaag ke saath jute rahane kaa saahas bhi tha
 Despite this, he had to go through many hardships for a long time to get the support of his people
 us mahatvapurn avasar ko shabdon main chitrit karte hue george halski, jo roshadel pynirs kii praarambhik team kaa sadsy rah chukaa tha, ne likhaa he— In the desire to make the final decision, some people dedicated to co-operation met enthusiastically in the damp and sad room of the warehouse
 As if some are gathering conspirators against the Parliament
 Showing their preparations, they were arguing over who would take the responsibility of closing the shop in the end
 One of them did not like this work, while the other hated shoplifting
 lekin unamem se kisi ke paas bhi aage badhane ke sivaay koi or vikalp nahin tha
 Bitter debate continued in them for a long time
 But after a while, the entire toadlane was echoing with his laughter
 ’20dhyatavya he ki un mazdooron kii durdasha kaa mukhya kaaran unki garibi thi
 They also lacked education and cultural training
 tathaapi yah bhi satya he ki us samooh ko sahakaarita ke saidhantik evam vyaavhaarik paksh kii puri jaankaree thi
 Despite difficult circumstances, the main reasons for their association were moral rather than economic
 prakarantar main isiilie sahakaar ko sabhi rashtron evam dharmalambiyon ne andolan ke rup main apnaane par jor diya, kyonki usamen nakaar ke sthaan par samarthan evam sahyog se kaam liya jaataa tha
 His organization was inspired by idealism rather than hunger
 21 sahakaar unhen kisi ek vyakti ke kalyaan kaa na sochakar puure samooh ke kalyaan kaa aashwaasan detaa tha, isliye samuhikta kii bhaavana ko bhi badhaata tha
 Although similar moral systems have also existed in Eastern and Western religious-moral scriptures, the capitalists had started using all those moral systems as weapons of exploitation by their influence and misuse of wealth
 sahakaar chunki prayek vyakti ko sahabhaagita ke saath samvaad kaa avasar bhi uplabdh karaata tha, isliye sahakaarita ko un paristhitiyon main adarsh mana gaya tha

 ' 'I bow to Rudra Agni, to the waters, to the medicinal plants that Rudra makes to all these Bhuvanas, i bow to that unique stunning Rudra
 ' Rudra, the father of the world - Rudra, the father of the whole world, see the mantra of the Rigveda in this subject- yahan rudra ko 'bhuvnsy pita' tribhuwanon kaa pita arthath utpannakarta or rakshak kaha he
 Rudra is the most powerful, so he protects these entire worlds with his special abilities
 vah parameshwar kaa guhanivasee rudra ke rup main varnan bhi veda main he- These meanings of the term 'rudra' are clearly stating that this Rudra is the universal God
 yahi bhav is vedamantra main he-'antarichhanti tan jane rudran paro manishaya
 'knowledgeable people desire to know that Rudra through intelligence in the very middle of man
 ' gyani log us rudra ko manushya ke ant:karan main dhundte hai
 That is, this Rudra is the Supreme Soul sitting in the innermost being
 yahi varnan anya vedamantron main he- One Rudra, widespread among many Rudras - these mantras which propose this subject are- arthath It is clear from this that many small Rudras are many souls and the great Rudra pervading them all is the universal God
 is vishay main yajurveda kaa mantra bhi drushtavy he
 Sayanacharya's opinion - In his commentary he has given these meanings of the term Rudra - shri uvatacharya kaa mat - Shri Mahidharacharya's opinion - swami dayanand saraswati kaa mat - In the Puranas, 'rudra' is equated with Shiva
 shiv kaa hi paryaay rudra ko mana gaya he
 His Ashtamurti is also indicated in the Yajurveda; But in many Puranas, the story related to it has been given in detail
 ekadash rudra kaa vivaran sarvapratham mahabharat main miltaa he
 Thereafter, the names of the eleventh Rudra are found in many Puranas, but there is no uniformity everywhere
 anek naamon main bhinnata milti he
 The accepted names are as follows: - vibhinn granthon main ekadash rudron ke naamon main bhinnataayen milti hai
 Their description is visible under the following points: - mahabharat ke adiparv main do bhinn adhyyon main ekadash rudra ke naam aaye he
 The names and order of both places are same: - matsaypurana, padmapurana, skandapurana aadi puraanon main samaan rup se ekadash rudron ke naam milte hai; parantu ye naam mahabharat ke khil bhaag harivansh tathaa agnipurana, garudpurana aadi kii uparilikhit suchi se kuch bhinn hai :- According to Harivansh and Agnipuran, Daksha-daughter Surabhi, after getting a groom from Mahadev ji, produced eleven Rudras through Kashyap ji
 yahan ajaikapaad, ahirbudhnya, twashta tathaa rudra ko mahadev ji ke hi prasad se utpann bhinn santaanon ke rup main gina gaya he
 These four have been called the sons of Vishwakarma in Garuda Purana
 rugveda main ajaikapaad evam ahirbudhnya ko rudra se bhinn devtaa ke rup main sthaan praapt he
 There are two traditions going on in the Puranas
 ek in donon ko rudra ke hi rup maanane kii, tathaa duusari inhen rudra se bhinn maanane kii
 The number of Rudras in Harivansh is reported to be hundreds and in Agnipuran hundreds-millions are also spread, due to which this grazing world is spread
 shivpurana main shatarudriya samhita ke antargat ekadash rudron ko shiv ke ek avatar ke rup main varnan he
 It is said here that Lord Shiva was pleased with Kashyapji's penance and took birth as eleven Rudras from the womb of Kashyap's wife Surabhi
 yahan diye gayi naam purvokt sabhi soochiyon se kuch bhinn hai :- In the Shaivagam, the names of the eleventh Rudras are given as follows: - indira gandhi nahar rajasthan kii pramukh nahar hai

 kumaanun kshetra main kai upbhashaain boli jaati hai
 Some of the main local languages are as follows: - kumaanun shabd kii vyutpati ke sambadh main vibhinn mat prachlit rahe hai
 From the point of view of language, it seems appropriate that this word is originally Kurma in Sanskrit
 champavat ke sameep 2196 meter unchaa kanteshwar parvat he jiske sambadh main manyata he ki bhagwaan vishnu apane dwitiya avatar main is parvat par teen varsh tak rahe
 Since then, he came to be known as kurm-anchal in place of Mount Kanteshwar
 is parvat kii akruti bhi kacchap kii peeth jaisi jaan padati he
 Probably this is the reason why this region may have been named as Kurmanchal
 pehle shaayad kurm shabd prayog main aata hoga, kyonki kurm shabd kaa prayog sthaneey bhashaa main bahutayat se miltaa he
 One of the reasons that the word Kumun may be replaced in place of Kurm can also be that the dialect here is found to be more uplifting
 kaalaantar main saahitiyik granthon, tamrapatron main kumuun ke sthaan par kumu or uske baad kumaun shabd sweekrut hua
 The use of the word Kurmanchal is also found in Sanskrit texts

 Apart from the Yaksha caste, there are also signs of residence of the Naga caste in Kumaon in the Adi era

 There are many temples in Kumaon named after the serpents
 jaise dhulanag, kalinag, pinglanag, kharharinag, basuki naag, nagdev ityadi
 The existence of Yaksha and Naga castes in the primitive castes of Kumaon is based on conjectures, but in relation to the Kirat caste, some societies can be said on the basis of classical and anthropological evidence that in the prehistoric era, the land of kumaon-garhwal, Kirat, Mongol The Adi was the abode of the non-aryan castes, who were conquered by the non-vedic Aryans who came from the north-west side at a time

 The prevalence of Shaka Samvat in Kumaon and the existence of Katarmal Sun Temple near Kosi in Almora confirms the possibility that after the primitive castes of Kirat, Raji, Nag, etc
, the Shaka caste has existed here
