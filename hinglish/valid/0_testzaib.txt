 Knowledge related to the transformation and control of electric power using solid-state electronics is called power electronics
 shakti electronic ke kaaran vidyut urja ke kshetra main krantikari parivartan hue hai
 Today, drives are available to drive motors ranging from 10 watts to several hundred megawatts
 6 jigawatt tak kii vidyut shakti lagbhag 1000 kilovolt ke ucch-voltata disi pareshan ke madhyam se transmit kii ja sakati he
 Trains, elevators, and cranes are all running smoothly through power electronics
 akshay urja ke sroton ke vidyut grid se jodne main shakti electronic kaa hi haath he
 Even radar systems rely on power electronics
 yadhyapi shakti electraniki main chote-mote sabhi electronic avyav prayukt hote hai, kintu nimnlikhit avyavay shakti electraniki ke vishishti pahchaan hai- Work in the field of power electronics was preceded by miniature-signal electronics
 sabase pehle vidyut shakti ke niyantran tathaa parivartan ke liye vidyut mashiinon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 This was followed by the Mercury Arc Rectifier
 tatpashchaat nirvaat evam gas-bhare vaalvon kaa yug aayaa
 The development of SCR in 1957 gave a new direction to Shakti Electronics
 aajkal esasiaar, jitio, bijetti, mossphate, aijibiti aadi swichon ke prayog se atyant dakshata purvak vidyut-shakti kaa parivartan kiya jaataa he
 Due to this, the field of power electronics has become very wide and important
 electraniki vigyaan kaa vah vibhaag he jisamen electron naliyon kaa athwa usee tarah kaa kaary karne vaale ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti ko vaanchit voltata, aavriti, dhara main dakshatapurvak badla jaataa he
 The fact is that electric power is used very rarely in the form we receive
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi udyog ko vidyut shakti 415 volt, 50 hertz asi ke rup main milti he
 It has to be electrocuted for which 0 to 20 volts DC is required, from which zero to 1200 ampere current will flow
 spasht he ki hamen jo vidyut praapt ho rahi he use sidhe is kaary ke liye upyog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa, balki use badalanaa padegaa
 This work is done by Shakti Electronics
 vastav main aise hajaaron udhaaharan hai jahaan vidyut shakti ko jyon kaa tyon upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa balki kisi duusare rup main badalanaa padataa he
 Important uses of electronic devices are: aajkal ke kai atiprachlit yantra bhi bina electraniki ke ban nahin pate, jaise radio, doordarshan, chalchitr, pratidipti prakaash, jan-vyaakhyaan-pranali, telephone aadi
 All these tips are the result of electronics
 electraniki ke kuch audyogic upyogon ke vishay main sankshep main neeche likh ja rahaa he : Inductors are often used in industries, by which the alternating current is converted into a specified current
 ve praaia: nimnlikhit main se ek prakaar ke hote hai : The use of multicomponent circuitous circuits in high power compensation is more profitable for several reasons than neglecting the use of single circuitry circuits
 pratham kaaran yah he ki aajkal vidyutiya shakti kaa utpaadan tathaa vitaran tri-kala-shakti ke rup main hota he
 The second reason is that the voltage generated by the polynomial bifurcation is more even than the voltage produced by the single bifurcation
 uparyukt ucchashakti rujukari main yaa to anek dhanagron ke liye ek hi runagra rahata he yaa anek dhanagar rujukari, jinke runagra jude rahete hai, prayog main laae jate hai
 Both types of minuscule are used
 motor kii chaal kaa niyantran kaagaj ke milon main vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he, kyonki chaal par hi kaagaj kii motaai nirbhar rahati he
 In these devices, the electric current of the exciter field is changed, which produces the controlling area for the generator
 yah janitr ek prime mover dwaara chaalit hota he
 The armature of the generator gives its output to the motor whose speed has to be controlled
 ek dashti-dhara-janitr is motor dwaara chalaaya jaataa he; vah apni chaal ke samaanupaat main voltata utpann karata he
 If that voltage is different from predetermined voltage then it activates a regulator
 yah niamak iksiter ke kshetra main aisa parivartan laa detaa he ki motor kii chaalu purvanishchit maan par aa jaae
 Many tubes are used in this regulator
 is prakaar electraniki kii sahaayta se motor kii chaal kaa niyantran atisookshm maan tak kiya ja saktaa he
 Industrial Uses of High Frequency Heating - Extremely powerful high frequency generators are being used a lot in heating by cross electrification and motivation
 jab kisi parvidyut ko sandharitra ke do patton ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he or sandharitra ko ek shaktishaalee ucch aavriti utpaadak se sambhddha kar diya jaataa he, to ek hanidhara ke kaaran parvidyut kaa taap bad jaataa he or hawa pighalane lagata he
 This type of rule is also for heating by inspiration
 ye yuktiyaan saadhaaran garam karne kii apeksha adhik laabhadaayak hai
 Electricity is used a lot in the industry to heat objects
 is vidhi se kaary bahut svachh hota he tathaa khuli hui jwaala upasthit nahin rahati
 The method of heating metals is called induction-heating and the method of heating non-conductive materials is called electro-heating
 in donon vidhiyon ke liye ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wrap a coil around the piece of metal to be heated and alternating current in it
 vidyut-pravaah se utpann chumbakeey syand vaayu main se tathaa kundali ke sameep upasthit dhaatu main se bhi hokar jaataa he
 The reversal of the current also changes the wind, which causes the voltage in the metal to be induced
 is voltata ke kaaran dhaatu main adhik maatra main bhanvar dhara kaa pravaah hone lagata he
 The heat is then generated due to the resistance of the metal
 vidyut se achaalak padaarthon ko tapt karne ke liye 1,000 kilocycle yaa 1 megacicle se adhik aavriti kii shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since current cannot flow through the object, the object is placed between high-voltage metal plates
 vidyut kshetra ke teevr parivartan ke kaaran achaalak vastu kii anu-saranchana main bhi vaise hi parivartan hone lagate hai
 Due to friction between molecules, the same temperature is produced everywhere in the object
 is vidhi se achaalak vastuon kii moti chaadaron ko bahut thode samay main tapt kiya ja saktaa he
 They can be compacted by moving high currents in two pieces of metal, ie, the machine has a capacitance converter, which converts 1 to 10 voltmeters from between two electrical currents of 220 or 440 volts
 And at the same time gives high electrification
 sandhan karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki dhara kaa pravaah alp samay ke liye hi ho
 a contact-circuit is used by this
 yah yukti paripath ko sheeghra-sheeghra jodatii or todatii rahati he
 The contact-circuit uses an electron tube called the "ignitron"
 ignitron ek vishesh prakaar kii gas-yukt nalee hoti he, jo ucch vidyut-dhara ko sanbhaal sakati he
 Its use is similar to a thyratron tube

 Although several sources have listed six or more species of cheetahs, the classification status of most species is unresolved
 acinonix rex -king chita - se alag kii khoj ke baad ise parityakt kar diya gaya tha kyonki yah keval aprabhavi jin tha
 Woolen cheetahs of Acinonics jubatus guttatus species have also been altered due to ineffective genes
 sabase adhik manyata praapt kuch prajatiyon main shaamil hai: The cheetah has a strong chest and its waist is thin
 chita kii laghu charm par kaale rang ke mote-mote gol dhabbe hote hai jiskaa aakaar 2 se 3 semi ke uske puure sharir par hote hai or shikaar karte samay vah isse aasaani se chalaavaran karata he
 It has no spots on the white plane, but the tail has spots and the tail end has four to six black spheres

 The cheetah has a small head with big eyes
 iske kaale rang ke "ansu chihn" iske aankh ke kone vaale bhaag se naak ke neeche uske munh tak hoti he jisase vah apane aankh se surya kii raushnee ko dur rakhata he or shikaar karne main isse use kaaphi sahaayta milti he or saath hi iske kaaran vah kaaphi dur tak dekh saktaa he
 Though it can run at very high speed but its body cannot tolerate long distance running
 That is, it is a fast runner
 ek vayask chita kaa naap 36 se 65 kigram se hota he
 Its entire body length is from 115 to 135 cm while the tail length can be measured from 84 cm
 chita kii kandhe tak kii oonchai 67 se 94 semi hoti he
 Male cheetahs are slightly larger in size than female cheetahs and have a slightly larger head, but there is not much difference in the size of cheetahs and if they are seen separately it will be difficult to differentiate them
 samaan aakaar ke tenduen kii tulana main aam taur par chita kaa sharir chota hota he lekin isaki poonch lambi hoti he or chita unase oonchai main bhi zyada hota he lambaai hoti he) or isliye yah adhik suvyavasthit lagata he
 Some cheetahs have rare skin pattern changes: large, spotted, spotted stained cheetahs are known as "king cheetahs"
 ek baar ke liye to ise ek alag prajati hi maan liya gaya tha, lekin yah mahaj africa chita kaa ek parivartan he
 The "king Cheetah" is seen only briefly in the jungle, but is reared in captivity
 chita ke panje main ardh sikudan yogya naakun hote hai, jisase use ucch gati main atirikt pakad milti he
 Cheetah claws have similar ligaments to other cats and only lack the skin cover and other varieties have skin and therefore claws are always visible with the exception of the divlaw
 divclau bahut chote hote hai or anya billiyon kii tulana main sidhe hote hai
 The cheetah is designed in such a way that it is capable of running very fast, the reasons for its fast running are its large nasal cavity which allows maximum oxygen to be taken and it has a wide heart and lungs which Work together to circulate oxygen efficiently
 jab yah shikaar kaa teji ke saath peechha karata he to iskaa shwaas dar prati minute 60 se bad kar 150 ho jaataa he
 Being a semi-shrinkable nail, it can run with a grip on the ground, the cheetah uses its tail as a direction controller, meaning steering that allows it to turn fast and this prey
 But it is necessary to attack from behind because the prey often use such rotation to escape
 badi billi ke vipareet chita ghurghuraahat ke rup main saans lete hai, par garjan nahin kar sakate hai
 Conversely, large cats can roar but not grunt, except for the time of breathing
 However, the cheetah is still considered by some to be the smallest species of big cats

 The physical structure of a cheetah is also quite different from that of a leopard, especially its thin and long tail and unlike leopard its spots are not arranged like rose flower carvings
 chita ek samvedansheel prajati he
 Among all the big cat species, this is a species that does not accept new environments quickly
 isane hameshaa hi sabit kiya he ki ise kaid main rakhana mushkil he, haalanki haal hi main kuch chidyaghar iske paalan-poshan main safal hue hai
 Because of its widespread hunting for its skins, cheetahs are now becoming incapable of both natural habitat and hunting
 purv main billiyon ke bich chita ko vishesh rup se aadim mana jaataa tha or lagbhag 18 million varsh pehle ye prakat hue the
 However, new research suggests that the emergence of 40 extant cat species is not so old — they appeared about 11 million years ago

 In 1608, the Mughal Emperor Jahangir of India has been recorded as having a white cheetah
 tujke-e-jahangir ke vrutant main, samraat kaa kahana he ki unke rajya ke tisare varsh main: raja bir singh dev ek safed chita mujhe dikhaane ke liye laae the
 However, among other types of creatures were white varieties of birds and other animals

 Blue cheetahs are described as white with different white-gray-blue spots or pale brown cheetahs with dark brown spots
 1921 main tanzania main main bilkul kam dhabbon ke saath ek chita ko paaya gaya tha, iske gardan or prishthbhumi ke kuch sthanon main bahut kam dhabbe the or ye dhabbe kaaphi chote the
 Geographically, there is such a population of cheetahs in Africa and Southwest Asia that is isolated
 inaki ek choti aabaadi iran ke khurasaan pradesh main bhi rahati he, chiton ke sangrakshan kaa kaarybhaar dekh rahaa samooh inhe bachaane ke prayaas main puri tatparta se juta hua he
 It is possible that some number of them are also present in India, but nothing can be said with confidence about this
 According to unconfirmed reports, some Asian-origin cheetahs are also present in the state of Bluechistan of Pakistan, recently a dead cheetah was found from this area
 chito kii nasl un kshetron main adhik panapati he jahaan maidani ilaaka kaaphi bada hota he or isamen shikaar kii sankhya bhi adhik hoti he
 The cheetah prefers to live among open fields and semi-wetlands, large meadows and thick shrubs, although they have different habitat in different areas
 misaal ke taur par namibia main ye ghasbhumi, savana ke jangalon, ghaas ke bade maidaanon or pahari bhubhag main rahete hai
 Just as hunter dogs are used today in hunting small animals, similarly the elite used cheetahs for hunting deer or gazelle at that time
 maadaa chita bees se choubees maheene ke andar vyask ho jaati he jabaki nar chitah main ek varsh kii aayu main hi paripakvata aa jaati hai or sambhog puraa saal bhar hota he
 Reports on cheetahs found in Serengati suggest that female cheetahs have a free-spirited nature, which is why their children have different fathers
 maadaa chita garbh dhaaran karne ke baad ek se lekar nau bacchon ko janm de sakati he lekin ausatan ye teen se paanch bacchon ko janm detii he

 If a player, who has played in the first IIFF tournament, wishes to change his national team, he must have played in his new country for four years
 ek khilaadi keval yah ek baar kar saktaa he
 The original IOC regulations stated that an athlete who had previously played for a nation could not change nations later under any circumstances

 In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow "open competition" among all players of the World Championship
 haalanki, enechael khilaadiyon ko olympic main khilne kii ijaajat nahin di gai thi, kyonki enechael ne madhya sijan or iosi kii shaukia niti ko todane kii anichhaa kii vajah se kiya tha
 Prior to the 1984 Winter Olympics, a dispute that would have made a player a professional was created
 iosi ne ek niyam apanaaya tha jisane kisi bhi khilaadi ko banaaya tha jisane enechael anubandh par hastakshar kiya tha lekin lig yogya main das se kam khel khelaa tha
 However, the United States Olympic Committee has ensured that any player contracted with the NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play
 iosi ne ek apatkaaleen baithak yojit kii jisamen enechael anubandhit khilaadiyon kaa shashan tha, jab tak ki ve kisi bhi enechael khelon main nahin khele the
 It made five players for the Olympic roster — one Austrian, two Italian and two Canadian — ineligible

 Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson said the rule only applied to the NHL and that professional contracted players in the European League were still considered amateurs

 The American "dream Team" dominated the tournament, and NHL Commissioner Gerry Bateman commented that "global awareness of" increased dramatically "
 unhone aashaa vyakt kii ki enechael kii bhagidaari "jaise expozar milegi jaise vishwa ne kabhi hockey ke liye nahin dekha"
 The typical NBA season is held in winter and spring, so the Summer Olympics do not conflict with the regular season schedule
 betman ne "greeshmakaleen khelon main hockey ko sthanantarit karne kii ek avadharana shuru kii", lekin olympic charter ke kaaran ise asweekaar kar diya gaya tha
 In March 1995, Batman, René Fussell, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and NHLPA Executive Director Bob Goodeno met in Geneva, Switzerland
 ve ek aise samjhaute par pahunch gaye jo eneechael khilaadiyon ko japan ke nagano main 1998 ke khelon ke saath olympic main bhaag lene kii ijaajat detaa tha

 Some NHL team owners were against the players participating in the tournament because of concerns about injury or exhaustion
 philadelphia flyres ke maalik aid snidar ne tippanee kii ki "main olympic main ek aastik hum or mujhe lagata he ki enechael bhaag lene ke liye acha he, unhone kaha, jo log bhaag lete hai, ve bilkul swasth hon
 "some NHL players used the break as an opportunity for relaxation and did not participate in the tournament, and many players were injured during the Olympics and were forced to miss the NHL games
 betman ne kaha ki kai praaroop parivartanon par charchaa kii ja rahi thi taaki toornament sabhi ke liye thodaa aasaan ho
 It was originally thought that a deal would have to be negotiated between the NHL and the NHLPA in a collective bargaining agreement to participate in the NHL 2014 Winter Olympics
 janvari 2013 main, enechael or enechaelpie ek nae samuhik saudebaaji samjhaute par sahamat hue

 paul keli kaa maananaa tha ki enechael ke aais hockey federation of rus or kantinental hockey lig ke saath tanaavpurn sambandh bhagidaari ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 In a 2009 interview, KHL President Alexander Medvedev claimed that the reluctance of NHL officials to immediately commit to Sochi games is "a means of coercion" to force a transfer agreement between the two leagues

 Will do; Matty Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the event organizer's responsibility to cover the cost of the event, and that "in our view, the same party should pay the bills, and that is not us

 After the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and adopted Canadian rules - six men per side and three during the game
 toornament ichaef dwaara upyog kiye gaye niyamon kaa paalan karte hai
 At the 1969 IIHF Congress, officials voted to allow the body to be examined in all three areas in a rink similar to the NHL
 isse pehle, sharir kii jaanch ko keval antarrashtriya hockey main bachaav kshetra main hi anumati di gai thi
 Many other regulations were enacted in the early 1970s: players starting in 1970 had to wear helmets, and in 1972 Goltarkar masks became mandatory
 1992 main, ichaef ne padak vijetaon ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye ek plaof system kaa istemaal karne ke liye switch kiya or faisla kiya ki padak ke daur main taai khel shootout main tay kiye jaaenge
 In 1998, the IIHF passed a rule that allowed two-line passes
 iske pehle, tatasth kshetra jaal ne khel ko dhimaa kar diya or scoring ko kam kar diya
 Current IHAF rules differ slightly from those used in the NHL

5 meter ke antarrashtriya aakaar ke bajaay, 61 em × 26 meter maapne vaali enechael rink, kam he

 In addition to the minor and double minor penalties called for at the IHH games, the NHL rules call for more dangerous infractions, such as fighting, a five-minute major penalty
 yah ichaef niyam ke vipareet he, jiske dwaara khilaadiyon ko khel se nikaal diya jaataa he
 With the 2005–06 season, the NHL introduced several new regulations
 kuch log pehle se hi ichaef dwaara upyog kiye gaye the, jaise ki golibari or do-line paas
 Others were not picked up by the IIHF, such as those requiring small goaltender devices and the rink other than the goaltender trapezoid
 haalanki, iietheff ne enechael kii shunya-sahishnutaa niti kaa paalan karne ke liye rukaawat or aavashyak hisaab, dhaaran or hastkshep dand kol karne ke liye aavashyak anupaalan kaa paalan karne ke liye sahmati vyakt kii thi
 Each team is allowed between 15 and 20 skaters and two or three goaltenders, all of whom must be citizens of the country to play

 In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee pushed American NHL players, who were potential Olympians, to be subjected to random drug tests

 The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same test from Wada
 enegel plaof khatm hone ke baad ek samjhauta hua tha ki wada pareekshan khilaadiyon ko shuru karegaa
 In late 2005, two NHL players were listed as potential Olympians, failing drug tests administered by Veda

 Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin was one of the Russian-language poetical poets who is considered the best poet of Russian
 unhen aadhunik roosi kavita kaa sansthaapak bhi mana jaataa he
 We can understand Pushkin's short life span of 38 years by dividing it into 5 sections
 26 may 1799 ko unke janm se 1820 tak kaa samay balykaal or praarambhik sahitya rachana ko sametataa he
 The period from 1820 to 1824 is the exile period

 He reached the peak of fame in 1826–1831, approaching the Tsar
 1831 se unki mrityu tak kaa kaal unke liye bada duhkhadaayi rahaa
 At the age of twelve, Pushkin was sent to study at Tsarskoyeselow's boarding school

 Using the freedom to express his views in a free environment, Pushkin wrote poems like Odd to Liberty, Chadayev and in the country

 In 1823, he was sent to Odessa
 oddesa main jin do striyon se unki najdikiyaan raheen unamem ek thi ek sarb vyapaaree kii italian patni emilia rigenich or duusari thi praant ke governor general kii patni countes vorontsov
 These two women made a deep impression in Pushkin's life

 But on the other hand, the increased proximity to the Countess was not in his interest

 Petersburg
 mulaakaat ke dauraan jaar ne pushkin se us kathith shadyantr kii babat poocha bhi jisaki badaulat unhen nirvaasan bhogana padaa tha
 He remained suspicious in the eyes of power and his creations had to fall prey to the censors, but Pushkin's love for freedom always persisted

 Aviation began in the modern era on November 21, 1783, by the first unmanned man-to-air air-to-air hot air balloon, developed by the Montgolfi brothers of France

 Before the last decades of the nineteenth sati, Hindi publishing was relatively less in the publishing industry of Meerut, a stronghold of Khadi Boli
 lekin sadi ke antim dashakon main isamen badlaav hua
 Arya Samaj of Dayanand Saraswati and Pandit Gauridatt Sharma, a local resident of Meerut, contributed heavily to this
 swami dayanand saraswati ke bhaashanon se prabhavit hokar khud ko devanagari ke prachaar ke liye samarpit kar dene vaale pandit gauridatt sharma ne 1887 main ek masik patr 'devanagari gajet' or 1892 main devanagari prachaarak ' nikaala
 In 1894, the Nagari Pracharini Sabha was formed and the monthly paper Devanagar was published
 ye sabhi patr yahi ke chhapekhanon main prakashit hote the
 Apart from this, Pandit ji also wrote a novel 'the Story of Devrani Jethani'
 pehali baar 1870 main iskaa prakaashan meerut ke jian chhapekhane main litho paddati se hua
 Its copy is still preserved in the National Library of Calcutta
 hindi ke mashhoor sahityakar acharya kshemchandra suman ne ise khadi boli hindi kaa pehla upanyaas kaha he
 Panditji through his letters published Bhajan and Aarti in Devanagari Gazette to promote Devanagari
 unke bhajan mahilaon main kaaphi lokapriy the
 Panditji was so devoted to the promotion of Devanagari that he used Jai Nagari in mutual greetings as well
 acharya kshemchandra suman ke mutabik hindi kaa doosraa upanyaas vama shikshakmunshi kalyanrai ne munshi ishwari prasad ke saath milakar 1872 main likhaa tha
 It was printed about 11 years later in 1883 in the Vidya Darpan printing office of Meerut
 in sahityakaron ke prayaas se khadi boli ke garh janapad meerut main unnisvin sadi ke ant main hindi prakaashan bhi bahutayat main hone lage
 In the early period most publishers were around the old tehsil of Meerut
 iske alaava vartmaan subhash bazaar bhi prakaashan kendra tha
 Owner Tulsiram Owner had a huge contribution in the publishing industry of Meerut
 unhone 1885 main meerut main swami press kii sthapana kii
 In the early stages, it was printed in the Leitho method
 tulsiram ji aryasamaj ke adhyaksh the
 He also founded Budhana Gate Aryasamaj
 samyaveda kaa bhashya unka bada pramanik granth mana jaataa he
 Apart from this, he also wrote and published many books
 ye sari pustaken swami press se hi prakashit hui thim
 At that time, the owner's press used to have a lot of name in the publication of voter lists
 yahaan lakhanu tak kii matadaata suchiyaan prakashit hoti thim
 His grandson Uma Shankar Sharma said that Swami Press used to be a very big press of his time during his grandfather's time
 us samay unke yahaan kareeb 200 karmi kaam kiya karte the
 In addition to his books and voting lists, the owner press also published books and other material from several publishing groups
 tulsiram ji ne vaidic dharm ke prachaar ke liye veda prakaash naamak masik patr bhi nikaala
 Tulsiram died at the age of 42
 ab to bas is press kii yaaden hi kuchhek meratvaasiyon ke jehan main hai
 Ghasiram MA LLB, another distinguished scholar of Aryasamaj, also contributed greatly to the development of the publishing industry of Meerut
 unhone kai pustaken likhi
 Apart from this, some books of English language were also translated into Hindi
 maujuuda samay main meerut kaa prakaashan udyog puri tarah se shaikshik prakashnon kaa kendra ban gaya he
 Although the publication of such books began in Meerut in the 20th century itself, but in the last phase of the 19th century, many letters and papers giving knowledge of the subject were published
 sar wiliam myor ke sangrakshan main saptahik urdu patr kaa prakaashan meerut se hota tha
 It was printed in Sultan ul Press
 is patr main prakashit saamagree vidhyaarthiyon ke upyog kii thi
 Started about two hundred years ago, the publishing industry of Meerut has now concentrated mainly on the publication of academic books
 aazaadee ke pehle tak meerut shaikshik pustakon ke vikray kaa pramukh kendra tha
 At that time there were many big booksellers in Meerut, whose main business was book sales
 saath hi ye kuch pustaken bhi prakashit karte the
 Among them were Ramnath Kedarnath, Jayaprakash Nath & Company, Khairati Lal, Rastogi & Company, Rajhans Prakashan etc
 us samay shaikshik pustakon kaa prakaashan pramukh rup se sarkari prakaashan house hi karte the
 Many cities of North India used to read books from Meerut itself
 aazaadee ke baad sthiti main badlaav hua
 The initiative of Rajendra Agarwal, a student of MA Economics, Meerut College, changed the appearance of the publishing industry in Meerut
 rajendra agarwal ne sarvapratham meerut kalege ke hastal madan mohan se 1950 main bharat bharti ke naam se prakaashan vyavsaay shuru kiya
 Later, after taking objection from the college administration, he took office on rent on Kachari road
 us daur main meerut main pustak vikray or prakaashan ke sabhi kendra subhash bazaar main hi the
 The idea of opening a publishing house outside Subhash Bazaar at that time could not even be thought of
 shuru main tab ke kai prakashkon ne rajendra agarwal ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 But later, more or less all the big publishers came to the court
 ab to kachhari road ko prakaashan maarg bhi kaha jaataa he
 At this time Chitra Prakashan, Nagin Prakashan, Pragati Prakashan, GR Batla and Sons, Bharat Bharti Prakashan etc
 are the offices of big publications of Meerut
 aaj meerut main shaikshik prakashnon ke kai bade naam hai
 Arihant Prakashan, which started only ten years ago, is a pioneer in the publication of competitive examinations across the country
 abhi halaat yah hai ki shaayad hi puure desh main koi aisi dukaan hogi jahaan meerut se prakashit pustaken na hon
 Meerut can also be called the city of publications
 meerut ke prakashnon kii koi aadhikarik ginati to nahin kii gai he lekin meerut ke prakaashan udyog se jude logon kaa maananaa he ki meerut main chote bade takreeban 75 prakaashan hai
 People associated with the industry consider its annual turnover to be around 200 million
 is vyavsaay main pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup se takreeban ek lakh logon ko rojgaar mila hua he
 The publishers of Meerut have worked hard to get the business into this position

 2722 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2722 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 2722 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he
 The first word-collections were made in India
 bharat kii yah shandaar parampara vedon jitani—kam se kam paanch hajaar varsh—puraani he
 Prajapati Kashyap's Nighantu is the oldest word collection in the world
 is main 1800 vaidic shabdon ko ikattha kiya gaya he
 Maharishi Yask's explanation on Nighuntu is the first dictionary and encyclopedia of the world 'nirukta'
 is mahaan shrunkhlaa kii shashakt kadi he chhathi yaa saatvin sadi main likhaa amarsingh krit 'namalinganushasan' yaa 'trikand' jise sara sansar 'amarkosh' ke naam se jaanata he
 Amarkosh can be called the first parallel dictionary of the world
 sanskrit main tikaa, vyakhya or bhashya kii pranali vishesh mahatv rakhti he
 These commentaries have special significance in almost all types of texts
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki anek tikaaon main mul kii apeksha adhik baaten, nutan vyakhya tathaa khandan-mandan dbaara navy maton kii bhi sthapana kii gai he
 The work of commentators of the lexicon is also of great importance
 unamem jahaan ek ore nae shabd, naveen, arth or nai vyakhyaayein hai vahiin duusari ore anek koshkaron or koshgrathon ke naam bhi milte hai
 There are many commentators who are authors themselves and who have also written commentaries of their own texts
 adhikansh ne keval tikaayen banaai he
 'amarkosh' commentaries are the most and perhaps the most ancient
 unka anuwaad hindi aadi bhashaaon main koshkaran bhi kiya gaya he
 In these commentaries, the names and sometimes quotations of many earlier lexicons or lexicons are found
 amarkosh ke tikaakar 'kshiraswami' tathaa 'hemchandra' ne kavy kosh ke nanarth or paryaayavachi koshon kaa sanket diya he
 It is also targeted by these that sometimes there were semantic interpretations of the word, such as 'petty - poresamopetan chalanam titau: pumana'
 athwa 'skandhadudhvan taroh shakha katpre vitapi matah'
 Hemachandra mentions 30 lexicons or lexicons
 tikaa aadi ke aadhaar par, tarapal, durg, dharnidhar, dharmamuni, rantidev, rudra vishwaroop, bopadev, shubhang, vopalit, krishnakavi aadi naanaa naam milte he
 The conspiracy of 'rakshasa' or 'rabhas' is also mentioned
 in koshtikaaon main shabdon kii vyutpattiyaan bhi he
 In the 'ramashrayi' commentary of 'amarkosh', there is a panoramic grammatical derivation of each word
 kabhi-kabhi kisi main trutiyaan or kabhi kabhi prayog bhi bataae gaye he
 Together, these vaccines can be called an important part of cytoplasm
 vastutah ye koshon ke poorak ang he
 In these, the subjects 'above, anukta and durukta' have been considered and discussed
 atah sanskrit koshon ke itihaas main inkaa mahatv or yogadan hamen kabhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 The vulnerabilities of modern and western shells may be as follows: yorape main vishesh rup se or bharat main aanshik rup se - aadimadhyakaalin koshkarm main kathin shabdon kaa saral shabdon yaa paryaayon dwaara arthgyapan hota tha
 a synonym was commonly given in Europe and semantic synonyms were used in India from the Vedic period
 inamen durbondhy or kathin shabdon ke sangrah kii mukhya prerana thi
 Due to the multiple collection of synonyms in Indian dictionary, synonyms also included simple words in synonyms
 nighantu kaa shabdasankalan bhai vaidic vaanmay ke samgr shabdanidhi kaa sangrah na hokar adhikt: durbodhya or vivechy shabdon kii sankalan prerana se prabhavit he
 The ancient dictionaries of India were synonyms or synonyms
 aarambhik avasthaa main nanarthak shabdon inamen parishisht judaa rahata tha
 Later on, the term Nanarthak or Anekarth was being assessed in detail
 falat: sanskrit ke anek nanarth koshon main mukhyat: namsangrah hota tha or aage chalakar lignirdosh bhi hone laga
 The collection of synonyms had become quadratic
 nanarth shabdon kii kram yojana main antya vyanjanakshar kaa kram apanaaya gaya
 But sometimes with the help of Kabhai Adivarna, an attempt was also made for alphabetical word-order
 par duusari ore aadhunik koshon main laghu koshonke atiritk paryaay ke saath saath arthbodhak vyakhyaayein bhi di jaati he
 In Sanskrit it was not
 tikaayen avashya yah kaary karti thim
 Like synonyms in Sanskrit, there is no attempt to put more emphasis on synonyms in modern dictionaries
 kabhi kabhi avashya hi sanskrit koshon ke prabhaav se hidi aadi main bhi paryayavachi kosh ban jate hai
 But in fact this dictionary is exclusively from the Sanskrit dictionary, not the modern dictionary
 sanskrit ke pracheen koshon main mukhyat: namapadon, avyayashbdon tathaa kabhai kabhi dhaatuon kaa bhai sangrah hota tha
 The origins of grammar-influenced compendium probably appear in Panini's dative and ganpaths
 aarambh main, amarkaal or uske baad, sanskrit kaa mukhya rup namaliganushasanamak ho gaya
 Due to the variation of composition in modern thesaurus, it was discarded as an unusable
 parantu vyakaranamulak gyaan or prayog ke liye upyogi nirdesh prayek ke saath laghusanketon dwaara nidisht hote hai
 Today's dictionaries are made for all the people who want to know the meaning of any word that is simple or difficult in the language
 sanskrit koshon kaa mukhya rup padyatmak hota tha
 For this reason, they were able to use it mostly, who used to memorize lexicons
 prayog or arthgyan ke saath saath koshon ko kanthsth karnaa bhi ek uddeshy samajha jaataa tha par aaj ke naveen koshon kaa yah prayojan bilkul hi nahin hai
 The purpose of the ancient lexicons of Sanskrit was to increase the vocabulary of poets, literatures and readers of poetry
 parantu aadhunik kosho kaa mukhya prayojan he shabdon ke arth kaa gyaan or tatsambandhi ant baton kii jaankaree dete hue unke samichin prayog kii shatki badhanaa
 First of all extra words, derivation, etymology, and if a word has been misused, then its historical evidence, general meaning of Nana Artha and special reference - Combinatorial Description, Explanation of the meaning of compound words and idioms, and the meaning of metallic applications etc
 are also modern

 The construction or use of an instrument is for the purpose of extracting the sound of music
 siddhant rup se, koi bhi vastu jo dhwani paidaa karti he, vaadya yantra kahi ja sakati he
 The history of instruments begins at the beginning of human culture
 vaadyayantra kaa shaikshanik adhyayan, angrezi main orgenology kehalaata he
 Music composed using only instrumental music is called instrumental music
 sangeet vaadya ke rup main ek vivaadit yantra kii tithi or utpatti 67,000 saal puraani maani jaati he; kalakritiyaan jinhen saamanytah praarambhik bansuri mana jaataa he kareeb 37,000 saal puraani hai
 However, most historians believe that it is impossible to determine a specific time of the invention of the instrument, being subjective to the definition
 vaadyayantra, duniya ke kai aabaadi vaale kshetron main swatantra rup se viksit hue

 In search of who and when the first instruments were developed, researchers discovered various archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world
 kuch khojein 67,000 saal tak puraani hai, lekin vaadyayantra ke rup main unki haisiyat par aksar vivaad rahaa he
 Unanimously, a verdict was given about artifacts dating back to 37,000 years old or later
 sirf waisi kalakritiyaan bachi hui hai jo tikaoo saamagree yaa tikaoo tareekon kaa upyog karke banaai gai hai
 Thus, the samples discovered cannot be undisputedly considered the earliest instruments
 july 1995 main, slovenian puratatvavid evan turk ne slovenia ke uttar pashchimi kshetra main ek nakkashidaar haddi kii khoj kii
 The object, named Divje Babe Flute, has four holes that, Canadian music scientist Bob Fink believes, may have been used to play four notes of a diatonic scale

 However, some archaeologists have questioned the status of this flute as an instrument
 german puratatvavidon ne swabian alb main 30,000 se 37,000 saal puraani maimath kii haddi or hans kii haddi kii bansuri ko khoja he
 These flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic period and are more commonly accepted as the oldest known musical instruments
 vaadyayantra ke puratathvik sakshya, ur ke sumerai shahar main shahi kabristaan kii khudaai main paae gaye
 These devices include nine liers, two bean one silver double flutes, sistra and cymbals

 The tomb to which these instruments belonged was dated to carbon dating between 2600 and 2500 BCE, providing evidence that these instruments were being used in Sumeria by this time
 mesopotamia main nippur se praapt, 2000 BCE puraane keelakaar tablet par lahore ke taron ke naam ingit hai or yah swarlipi kaa sabase pracheen gyaat udhaaharan he
 Scholars agree that there is no completely reliable way of determining the exact chronology of instruments in different cultures
 unki jatilta ke aadhaar par vaadyayantron kii tulana or unka aayojan bhraamak he, chunki vaadyayantron main hone vaale vikaas ne kabhi-kabhi jatilta ko kam kiya he
 For example, the construction of early slit drums involved harvesting and hollowing out huge trees; Later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stems, which was quite easy
 isi prakaar kaarigari ke aadhaar par vaadyayantra ke vikaas ko yojit karnaa bhraamak he, chunki sabhi samskritiyaan vibhinn staron par vikaas karti hai or unhen alag-alag samagriyaan uplabdh hoti hai
 For example, anthropologists attempting to compare instruments created by two cultures that existed at the same time, which differed in their formation, culture, and handicraft, could not determine which instruments were more "primitive"
 bhugol ke aadhaar par yantron ko kramit karnaa bhi aanshik rup se avishwasaneey he, kyonki koi yah nirdhaarit nahin kar saktaa ki kab or kaise samskritiyon ne ek duusare se sampark kiya or aapas main gyaan saajha kiya
 The German music scientist, Kurt Sax, who is the most prominent music scientist and anthropologist of modern times, suggests that a geographical chronology dating to about 1400 is better, as it is limited subjectively
 1400 ke upar, samyavadhi ke aadhaar par vaadyayantra ke samgr vikaas ko liya ja saktaa he
 The science of marking the sequence of development of instruments is dependent on archaeological crafts, artistic notation and literary references
 chunki kisi ek anusandhan maarg main aankade adhure ho sakate hai, sabhi teen maarg ek behatar aitihaasik tasviir uplabdh karaate hai
 European music history, written until the 19th century, begins with these mythological descriptions of how instruments were invented
 aise vivaranon main shaamil he jubaal, can ke vanshaj or "un sabhi kaa pita jo harp or organ sambhalate hai", paan, panpipe ke avishkaarak or marakari, kaha jaataa he jisane kachhue ke sookhe khol se pehla lahore banaaya tha
 Modern history has replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation and is sometimes corroborated by archaeological evidence
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki vaadyayantra kaa koi nishchit "avishkaar" nahin kiya gaya, chunki "vaadya yantra" shabd kii paribhaasha vidwaan or bhavi-avishkaarak, donon ke liye puri tarah se vyaktiparak he
 For example, a Homo Habilis slapping his body could be an under-construction instrument regardless of its intent
 maanav sharir se pare jin upkarnon ko pratham vaadyayantra mana jaataa he, ve hai jhunjhune, stamper or vibhinn prakaar ke drum
 ye aarambhik yantra, bhaavnaatmak harkaton, jaise nrity main dhwani jodne ke maanav ke sanchaalan aaveg ke kaaran viksit hue
 aakhirkaar, kuch samskritiyon ne apane vaadyayantron ke liye anushthan kaaryakramon ko joda

 The early cultures for which drums developed ritualistic and even sacred significance are the Chukchi people of Far Eastern Russia, the native people of Melanisia, and many cultures in Africa
 In fact, in every African culture, drums were widely present
 ek purvi africa janajati, vahinda ise itnaa pavitra maanati thi ki sultan ke alaava ise dekhne vaale kisi anya vyakti ke liye yah ghaatak hota tha
 Eventually humans developed the concept of using instruments to produce melodies
 vaadyayantra ke vikaas main is samay tak, raag, sirf gayan main hi aam tha
 Similar to the process of repetition in language, instrumentalists first developed repetition and then instrumentalization
 An early form of melody was produced by banging a tube of two different sizes - one tube produced a "clear" sound and the other produced a "deep" sound
 aise yantron ke jode main bullrorer, slit drum, sip turahiyaan or khaal drum bhi shaamil he
 Cultures that used pairs of these instruments linked gender with them; The "father" was a larger or more energetic device, while the "mother" was a smaller or slower device
 sangeet ke vaadyayantra hazaron varshon tak is rup main bane rahe, jab tak ki praarambhik zylophone ke rup main, sur ke teen yaa usase adhik pattern kaa vikaas nahin hua
 Xylophone originated in the mainland and archipelago of Southeast Asia and from there it spread to Africa, America and Europe
 Along with the xylophone, which ranged from a simple three "leg bar" set to a carefully tuned set of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the Bhumi Veena, Bhumi Jithar, musical Dhanush and Jau Harp

 Despite this development, very few instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia main vaadyayantron ke praarambhik itihaas ko phir se sangathit karne ke liye vidwaanon ko sumerion yaa acadian main likhi kalakritiyon or keelakaar lekh par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Even the process of naming these devices is challenging since there is no clear distinction between the various tools and the words used to define them

 Rather, the history of musical instruments in the region begins with the Indus Valley Civilization which dates back to around 3000 BC
 Emerged around
 The various rattles and whistles found with the artifacts found in the excavations are the only physical evidence of the instrument

 People began writing books about the making, playing and cataloging of instruments; The first such book was Sebastian Firdung's 1511 treatise Musica getuscht und angezogen
 Firdung's work is considered particularly complete because it also included descriptions of "irregular" instruments such as hunter's horns and cow bells, although Firdung has also criticized them

 In the sixteenth century, the "classical motifs" that instrument makers gave to most instruments continue to this day, such as the violin
 Format beauty was also noticed - listeners were just as fascinated by beauty as an instrument
 Therefore, manufacturers paid special attention to materials and workmanship and instruments became collectibles in museums and homes

 In the Baroque period, organ-related changes occurred in the organ, as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stagnation more meaningful and added some equipment such as expressive paddles
 Sachs saw this trend as a "collapse" of the organ's normal sound

 ek pracheen pranali, jo kam se kam 1 shatabdi i
pus
 se chali aa rahi he, vaadyayantron ko chaar mukhya vargeekaran samoohon main vibhajit karti he: ve upkaran jahaan dhwani taar hilaane se utpann hoti he; ve vaadyayantra jahaan dhwani hawa ke khandon ke kampan ke dwaara utpann hoti he; lakdi yaa dhaatu ke bane parakashan vaadyayantra; or chamade ke mukh vaale parakashan upkaran yaa drum
 victor-charles mahilon ne baad main, bahut kuch isi prakaar kii pranali ko apanaaya
 ve brussels main sangitvidyalay main vaadyayantra sangrah ke sangrakshak the or sangrah kii 1888 kii suchi ke liye vaadyayantron ko chaar samoohon main vibhajit kiya; tarayukt vaadya, haav vaale vaadya, parakashan vaadya or drum
 Erik von Hornbostel and Kurt Sax later took the ancient method and in 1914 published a comprehensive new scheme for classification in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie
 unki paddati ko aaj vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he or ise aksar hornbostel-sacks paddati ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The original sax-hornbostel method classified instruments into four main groups: sacks ne baad main ek paanchvaan varg joda, electrophone, jaise thermin, jo electronic tareeke se dhwani utpann karte hai
 There are several sub-groups within each class
 is pranali kii aalochana kii gai or ise pichley varshon main sanshodhit kiya gaya, lekin iskaa vyapak rup se prayog organologist or ethnomyuicologist dwaara hi kiya jaataa he
 Andre Schaffner, patron of the Musée de l'homme, disagreed with the saxe-hornbostel system and in 1932 developed his own system
 shafnar kaa maananaa tha ki ek vaadyayantra ke vargeekaran kaa nirdhaaran, uske vaadan kii vidhi ke bajaay uski shaareerik sanrachana ko karnaa chahie
 His method divided the instruments into two classes: instruments whose body is solid and vibratory, and instruments that have staggered air
 pashchimi vaadyayantron ko bhi, usee parivaar ke anya upkarnon ke saath tulana main aksar unki sangeet seemaa dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 These terminologies are based on the classification of singing sounds: kuch upkaran ek se adhik shrenee main aate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, celo ko yaa to tener yaa baas mana ja saktaa he, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki iskaa sangeet samooh main kaise feet baithta he or trombone ho saktaa he olto, tener, yaa baas or french horn, baas, baritone, tener, yaa olto, is baat par nirbhar karte hue kii kis sa par range yah khelaa jaataa he
 Template: Vocal and instrumental pitch ranges kai vaadyayantron main range, unke naam ke hisse ke rup main hota he: sopraano sexophone, tener sexophone, baritone sexophone, olto bansuri, baas bansuri, olto recorder, baas guitar, aadi
 Additional adjectives describe an instrument above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabas clarinet
 jab kisi vaadya ke naam main istemaal kiye jate hai to ye shabd saapeksh hote hai, jo vaadyayantra ke range ko uske parivaar ke anya upkarnon kii tulana main varnit karte hai or na kii maanav awaz ke range main yaa anya pariwaron ke upkarnon kii tulana main
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek baas bansuri kaa range C3 se F♯6 tak he, jabaki ek baas clerinet ek saptak neeche bajataa he
 Instrumental production is a specialized occupation that requires years of training, practice and sometimes becoming an apprentice
 vaadyayantron ke adhikansh nirmaataa, vaadyayantra kii kisi ek style ke visheshgy hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ek luthiar keval tharawaale vaadya banaata he
 Some producers make only one type of instrument such as a piano
 bhale hi vaadyayantra main dhwani kaise bhi utpann hoti ho, kai vaadyayantron main upyogkarta interfes ke rup main ek kunjeepatal hota he
 Keyboard instruments are instruments that are played by a musical keyboard
 har kunjee ek yaa ek se adhik dhwani utpann karti he; adhikansh kunjeepatal upkarnon main, in dhvaniyon main utar-chadhaav karne ke liye atirikt saadhan hote hai 
 ve hawa ke hilne se yaa pump karne se dhwani utpann kar sakate hai, hilte taron ko thokkar yaa khinchakar, electronic tareekon dwaara, yaa kisi anya tareeke se
 kabhi-kabhi, aise vaadyayantra jinamein aamtaur par ek kunjeepatal nahin hota he, jaise gloucenspil, unamem ek kunjeepatal laga diya jaataa he
 Although they do not have any movable part and are played with a mallet held in the hands of the player, they have the same physical arrangement of keys and produce sound waves in a similar manner
 chandragup, jise kabhi-kabhi chandrakup bhi kaha jaataa he, pakistan ke pashchimi balochistan praant ke tateey makraan kshetra main sthit ek garaamukhi he
 This Garamukhi at 58 meters high has the shape of a pure cone
 is kshetra main kai saare garaamukhi milte hai or chandragup inamen se ek he
 It is located near the mouth of the Hingol River
 is kshetra ke garaamukhi hinduon dwaara pavitra maane jate hai or inamen chandragup kaa vishesh sthaan he
 Pilgrims especially stop at Chandragup while visiting nearby Hinglaj pilgrimage site
 kuch hindu samudaayon main in garamukhiyon ko babhakhanath naamak devtaa kaa deraa mana jaataa he
 Aashiq is a 1962 Hindi language film
 dharm kaa arth hota he, dhaaran, arthath jise dhaaran kiya ja sake, dharm ,karm pradhan he
 Religion is what reflects virtues
 dharm ko gun bhi kah sakate hai
 It is worth mentioning here that the meaning of virtue in the word religion is not related to human
 padaarth ke liye bhi dharm shabd prayukt hota he yatha pani kaa dharm he bahna, agni kaa dharm he prakaash, ushma dena or sampark main aane vaali vastu ko jalaana
 From the perspective of generality, calling religion a virtue is absolutely appropriate in the sense of both living and non-living
 dharm saarvbhaumik hota he
 Whether there is a substance or a human, sitting in any corner of the whole earth, the religion of a human or a substance is the same
 uske desh, rang rup kii koi baadha nahin he
 Religion is eternal, that is, in every era, the form of religion remains the same
 dharm kabhi badalata nahin he
 For example, the religion of water, fire etc
 is the same from creation to the present day
 dharm or sampradaay main moolbhoot antar he
 The meaning of religion when it is worthy of being in virtue and life should be the same for every human being
 jab padaarth kaa dharm saarvbhaumik he to maanav jati ke liye bhi to isaki saarvbhaumikta honi chahie
 Therefore, in the context of humans, religion is only human religion
 hindu, muslim, isai, jain yaa buddha aadi dharm na hokar sampradaay yaa samudaay maatr hai
