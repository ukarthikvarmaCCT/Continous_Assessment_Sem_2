sanskrit bhashaa ke saath hi hindi kavy or sangeet kaa bhi aapane govindaswami se adhyayan kiya tha, jiskaa upyog aapane prachaar kaary main kiya
 In Gokulnath's Vaishnavite world, two particular reasons for fame are given
 pehla kaaran yah he ki inhone apane sampradaay ke vaishnav bhakton ke charitrik drushtaanton dwaara sampradayik upadesh dene kii lokapriy pratha kaa pravartan kiya
 These stories have been named 'dialogue literature' in Hindi literature
 aapaki prasiddhi kaa doosraa kaaran sampradayik anushrutiyon main 'malaprasang' naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 Due to this garland, Gokulnath is said to have received worldwide fame and honor in the Vaishnava world
 malaprasang kaa sambandh ek aitihaasik ghatana se bataaya jaataa he
 In 1674, Emperor Jahangir met Chidrup, a Vedant monk in Ujjain and Mathura, whose king was enchanted by his deep meditation
 vaishnavon main prachlit he ki uske kehane par badshaah ne vaishnavon ke bahya chinhon ke dhaaran karne par pratibandh laga diya
 Gokulnath ji succeeded in removing this prohibition
 yadhyapi is vaishnav parampara kii pushti aitihaasik granthon se nahin hoti
 Jahangir's 'atmacharit' or Persian historical material does not find mention of this incident anywhere
 parantu gokulanath ji ke vishay main yah miltaa he ki unhone jahangir se goswamiyon ke liye ni:shulk charaagaah praapt kiye the
 His fame and honor increased more than that in the Pushtimarji saints
 chidrup kii lokapriyata kam hui athwa nahin, kintu gokulanath ji kaa prabhaav uttarottar badhata gaya
 This later had a clear impact on his creations
 vaarta sahitya ke yashasvi kritikar evam prachaarak ke rup main unka naam bade aadar se liya jaataa he
 His writings in the principles of Vaishnavism and devotion were very good
 hindi sahitya ke itihaas granthon main gokulanath ji kaa ullekh unke 'vaarta sahitya' ke kaaran hua he
 There are two talk texts written by Gokulnath
 pehla 'churaasi vaishnavan kii vaarta' or doosraa 'do sau baawan vaishnavan kii vaarta'
 The authenticity of these two and the creation of Gokulnath has differed among scholars from the beginning, but with the latest research and practice it is being proved that the original talks were narrated by Gokulnath
 in vaartaon se vallabh sampradaayi kaviyon tathaa vaishnav bhakton kaa parichay praapt karne main atyadhik sahaayta praapt hui he
 Therefore, they cannot be considered insignificant as being unnatural
 sampradayik panraparaaon ke adhyayan se yah vidit hota he ki gokulanath ji ne sarvapratham shri vallabhacharya ji ke shishyon-sevakon kaa vrittant maukhik rup se 'churaasi vaishnavan kii vaarta' ke rup main kaha or tadnantar apane pita shri vitthalanath ji ke shishyon-sevakon kaa charitra 'do sau baawan vaishnavan kii vaarta' main sunaaya, yadhyapi gokulanath ne swayan in vaartaon ko nahin likhaa
 The work of writing and editing continued later
 vishesh rup se gusaai hariraay ne inke sampadan kaa mahatvapurn kaary kiya
 Pallavan, having penned these talks by writing 'bhava Prakash', included in detail some current events as well
 in ghatnaon main aurangzeb ke akramanon kii baat vishesh rup se dhyaan dene yogya he
 In fact, Hariray ji had linked the present day events of his era to Bhava Prakashan and Pallavan
 mul vaartaon main ve ghatnaayen nahin thim
 Subsequent editors and clerks have made the talks very misleading by adding several new themes
 kintu vaartaon kii pracheenatam pratiyon main un ghatnaon kaa varnan na hone se anek bhrantiyon kaa niraakaran ho jaataa he
 Talk literature has a very important place in the gradual development of Hindi prose and now they are being duly evaluated
 gokulanath ji rachit kuch or granth bhi uplabdh hai jinamein 'vanayatra', 'naity-seva-prakaar', 'baithak charitra', 'gharu vaarta', 'bhaavana', 'hasya prasang' aadi hai
 One of the reasons for Gokulnath's fame is his communal character
 gokulanath ke ishtdev kaa swaroop 'gokulanath' hi he or uske viraajane kaa sthaan gokul he
 In these places, instead of Swarup Seva, the throne is worshiped as the best
 inkaa sevaksamudaay bhanduchee vaishnavon ke naam se prasiddh he
 Gokulnathji was the most prominent Acharya preaching the Vallabh sect by Vachnamrit

 1947 sanskrit ke puraatanatam uplabdh shabdkosh vaidic 'nighantu' he
 His creation date is at least 700 or 800 BC
 vaidic shabdon ke sangrah ko 'nighantu' kehete the
 The Nirukta of 'yask' is the commentary of the Vedic Nighantu
 yask se purvavarti nighantuon main ekmaatr yahi nighantu uplabdh he par 'nirukt' se jaan padataa he ke 'yask' ke purv anek nighantu ban chuke the
 Therefore, it can be said that at least by 1000 BC Nihuntu shells were being edited
 vistrut jaankaree ke liye nighantu tathaa nirukt dekhen
 The ancient and medieval lexicons of Sanskrit are available to us in contrast to the Vedic nigantukhas and 'nirukta texts'
 is sambandh main 'mekdanald' ne mana he ki sanskrit koshon kii parampara kaa udbhav dhatupaathon or ganapaathon se hua he
 In the above mentioned lessons, the grammatical utility of metals and words in the supplementary form of Paniniya Ashtadhyayi occurred
 par unamem arthnirdesh na hone ke kaaran unhe keval dhatusuchee or ganasuchi kahana adhik samichin hoga
 Later on, the way in which the composition and semantics style has developed in most of the Sanskrit lexicons is completely different from the style of Dhanapatha or Ganapath
 nighantu granthon se inkaa swaroop bhi kuch bhinn he
 Nighantu used to have a collection of Vedic words
 unamem kriyaapadon, namapadon or avyayon kaa bhi sankalan kiya jaat tha
 But in Sanskrit lexicons, there was mainly collection of nomads and avyayas only
 'nirukt' ke samaan athwa paali ke 'mahavyutpatti' kosh kii tarah isamen vyutpattinirdesh nahin he
 The words stored in the Vedic nigantu are often associated with specific texts
 inaki rachana gadhy main hoti thi
 But the Sanskrit dictionary is predominantly poetic and mainly consists of the verses of Anushtupa
 sanskrit koshon dwaara shabdo or arth kaa parichay karaayaa gaya haih dhananday, dharni' or 'maheshwar' aadi koshon ke nirmaan kaa uddeshy tha sambhawatah mahatvapurn viralprayukt or kavijanopayogi shabdon kaa sangrah bananaa
 By giving historical overview of Sanskrit dictionary we can get general information about this subject
 is sambandh main vidwaanon ne 'amarsingh' dwaara rachit or sarvaadhik lokapriy 'namalinganushasan' ko centre main rakhkar usee aadhaar par sanskrit koshon ko teen kalkhandon main vibhajit kiya he- The earlier dictionaries of 'amarsingh' are not mentioned in his Namalinganushasan
 parantu 'samaahrutyanyatantrani' ke dhvanyarth kaa aadhaar lekar 'amarkosh' kii rachana main purvavarti koshon ke upyog kaa anumaan kiya ja saktaa he
 In a commentary on 'amarkosh', the approximation of the 'immortal-preceding lexicon' named 'katya' or 'katyayan' based on the word 'katya' and the lexicon named Vyadi on the basis of text
 'amarkosh' ke tikaakar 'kshiraswami' ke aadhaar par 'dhanvatari' ke 'dhanvatarapinighantu' naamak vaidyak nighantu kaa sanket miltaa he
 In the role of 'maharashtra Dictionary', 'bhaguri' Kekosh — whose 'trikandakosh' was — is described as 'amar-poorvati'
 yah kosh dakshin bharat kii ek grathsuchee main aaj bhi ullikhit he
 'ranti' or 'rantidev' and 'rasabh' or 'rasabhapal' are also cows called 'immortal-predecessor' Koshkar
 'sarvanand' ne 'amarkosh kii apni tikaa main bataaya he ki 'vyadi' or 'vararuchi' aadi ke koshon main keval lingon kaa sangrah he or 'trikand' evam 'utpalini' main keval shabdon kaa
 But 'amarkosh' incorporates the characteristics of both
 is prakaar 'vyadi', 'vararuchi' 'bhaguri' or 'dhanvantari' aadi anek koshkaron kaa kshiraswami ne amar-purvavarti koshkaron or 'trikand', 'utpalini', 'ratnakosh' or 'maala' aadi amar-purvavarti koshgrothon kaa parichay diya he
 There are some reasons for the importance of Amarkosh
 yadhyapi tatpoorvavarti kosh aaj uplabdh nahin hai tathaapi yah anumaan kiya jaataa he ki pracheen koshon main do prakaar kii sheliyaan kuch kosh naamon kaa hi or kuch lingon kaa hi nirdesh karte the
 They were called Namtantra and Lingtantra
 dwitiya vidha ke koshon main lingon kaa vivechanaatmak nirdesan hi mukhya vishay rahata tha
 But 'amar Singh has made a very mature combination and discussion of the two together in his dictionary
 aarambh main hi unhone tisare se paanchave shloke tak apane kosh main prayukt niyamon or paddati kaa spasht nirdesh kiya he
 On the basis of these, along with semantics, gender is also decided
 teen candon ke is granth main kramshah das, das or paanch varg hai
 According to the method specified in the undertaking section, the gender of nomads is strictly instructed
 isi kaaran iskaa abhidhaan 'namalinganushasan' he
 Introducing its uniqueness, the author himself has said that there has been an attempt to complete this Namalinganushasana 'by summarizing the subject of discussion from other tantras in a concise form and by reflexively dividing it into classes
 yahi isaki winsheshtha he
 The scandal and classes are divided according to systematic method
 vastutah dekha jaay to pratham do cond is kosh kaa paryaayavachi swaroop prastut karte hai ore tritiy cond main naanaa prakruti ke itar namapadon kaa sangrah he
 There is a collection of nampadas used in the adhyayana-nusari Lingadi in the Adhyayanighna class
 'sankeern' varg main prakruti pratyaadi ke arth dwaara ling kii uha kaa vivechan hua he
 In the 'naanarth' category, the names of Naanarth have been collected according to the order 'kant', 'khant' etc
 chaturth varg avyay shabdon ko sankalit karanevaala he or atim varg lingaisangrah kaha gaya he ev usamen shastreey or vyakaranniemanusaari aadhaar ko lekar ling kaa anushaasan mukhya rup se tathaa gaun rup se anya anukt-linganirdesh kii krambaddh paddati bataai gai he
 This dictionary is synonymous mainly
 phir bhi tritiy cond ke dwaar, jise ham aadhunik padaavalee main parishishtaansh kah sakate hai, is kosh kii purna or vyapak tathaa upyogi banaaya gaya he
 In the Amarparavarti period, many genres of Sanskrit dictionaries are targeted - in vidhaon ke atirikt aise kosh bhi milte hai jinamein kramshah ekakshar, dvayakshar, tyakshar or nanakshar shabdon kaa yojanabaddh rup se sankalan hua he
 'dual' dictionary is also made
 inke aririkt 'purushottamdev' kaa granth 'varnadeshna' he, jisamen likhaawat main swalpaadhik bhedon ke kaaran honevaale varnavinyas sambandhi vairupy parichay miltaa he
 There is also a dictionary of these, 'trikandakosh' in which there is a collection of words, left in Amarsingh's dictionary, but prevalent in the language 'tadyugin'
 'purushottamdev' kii hi ek rachana 'haravali' bhi he, jisamen viral prayogvaale 'ekarth' or 'anekarth' shabdon ke do bhaag hai
 The author himself has written that there is a collection of very rare words in this book
 'amarsingh' ke ananthar koshkaron or koshgranthon par amarkosh kaa paryaapt prabhaav dikhaai detaa he
 Many synonyms were written after taking influence from Amarkosh
 'nanarth' yaa 'anekarth' kosh bhi amarkosh ke nanarth varg ke aadhaar par praayah bahumukhi vistaarmaatr rahe hai
 In the 'vishwaprakash' dictionary, something more special appears
 vah vilakshan 'nanarthkosh' he jo anek adhyayon main vibhakt he

 This is also called 'eternal coin'
 'amarkosh' ke sankshipt nanarth varg kaa yah vistaar jaan padataa he

 The most famous of them was the folklore of the folklore of Kerala, an accomplished warrior of the Urumi or flexible sword

 Most of these warriors are sent to schools only when they are seven years old, where they are taught many tricks of agility and skill; There they teach them to dance, turn and take different kinds of curves on the ground, take royal leaps, other other types of jumps and by the time they are children, they learn it twice a day, thus they are so relaxed The joints become so flexible that their body is able to bend against nature; And when they become fully accustomed to it, they teach them to wield the weapons that they are most interested in, some with arrows and bows, some with sticks and spears - with sticks, But most continue to practice within these limits, with swords and shields
 jo guru unhen ye sikhaate hai unhen panikkar kaha jaataa he
 In the 19th century, due to the arrival of firearms, when the Nair warriors lost to the British and especially the complete establishment of British colonial rule, Kalari Payat went into a state of decline

 In recent years, attempts have been made to further popularize the art with its inclusion in international and Indian films such as Indian, Ashoka, The Myth, The Last Legion and the Japanese anime / manga series Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple

 Mithri is an elementary phase with rigorous physical sequences of arms, postures and complex bounces and turns
 baarah meipayattu abhyaas, sharir kii buniyadi mudraon kaa paalan karte hue tantrika-peshi samanvay, santulan or lacheelepan ke liye kiye jate hai
 Kalari payat stems not from aggression but from disciplining oneself
 isliye prashikshan kii shuruyaat bhautik sharir ko anushaasit or maansik santulan ko praapt karne se hoti he
 It is important not only for the learner of the martial arts but for anyone
 prashikshan ke pehle charan main shakti, lacheelaapan, santulan or sahanshakti kaa vikaas karne ke liye shaareerik vyaayaam shaamil he
 This includes jumping, lower posture on the floor, whirling order, foot injury, etc
 isamen sharir ke prayek ang ko nipun banane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he

 ek baar chaatr shaareerik rup se sakasham ho jaay to, unka parichay lakdi ke lambe hathiyaaron ke saath yuddh ke liye hota hai
 The first taught weapon is the Ballam Ketukari, which is usually 5 feet in length or as long as the student's forehead from the ground
 doosraa hathiyaar jo sikhaaya jaataa he wo cheruvaadi yaa muchan he, jo ek teen baalist, lagbhag dhai feet yaa 75 semi
lambi hoti he
 The third weapon taught is otta, a wooden twisted stick resembling an elephant's trunk
 iskaa sira gol he or pratidwandvi ke sharir main mahatvapurn sthanon par prahaar karne ke liye istemaal hoti he
 It is considered a major weapon and is a basic tool to develop stamina, agility, strength and skill
 otta ke prashikshan main 18 kram hote hai
 Once the practitioner becomes proficient in all wooden weapons, he starts the Ankathari, beginning with metal weapons, requiring tremendous concentration due to their lethal nature

 aamtaur par antim sikhaaya jane vaala hathiyaar, lacheelee talwaar he, ye ek behad khatarnaak hathiyaar he or sabase kushal chaatro ko hi sikhaaya jaataa he

 yah daawa kiya jaataa he ki siikhe hue yoddha apane virodhiyon ko sirf sahi marmam par chhu kar aksham kar sakate hai yaa maar sakate hai
 To discourage the misuse of technology, it is taught only to the most promising and calm-minded people
 maramshastram marmam ke gyaan par jor detaa he or ye marm upachaar marmachikitsa ke liye bhi istemaal hota he
 This system of marma treatment falls under the Siddha Vaidyam, to which the sage Agastya and, his disciples are credited
 kalari payat ke aalochakon ne bataaya he ki bahari tatasth vyaktiyon par marmam takneekon kaa upyog hameshaa satyapit parinaam nahin detaa hai
 The earliest mention of marmam is found in the Rigveda, where Indra defeats Vritra by striking him with the thunderbolt
 atharv veda main bhi marmam kaa sandarbh miltaa he
 With many scattered reference sources in the Vedic and epics, it is decided that the ancient warriors of India were aware of important points and also used it for attack and defense
 sushrut ne sushrut samhita main maanav sharir ke 107 mahatvapurn binduon kii pahchaan kii or unhen paribhaashit kiya tha
 Of these 107 points, 64 are classified as fatal, if they are hit with a stick or fist, they can be dangerous
 sushrut ke kaary ne chikitsa kii vyavastha ayurveda ko aadhaar pradaan kiya, jise vibhinn bhartiya yuddh kalaon ke saath sikhaaya jaataa tha, jiskaa mahatvapurn binduon par jor tha, jaise varm kalai or marm aadi
 As a result of learning about the human body, Indian martial arts practitioners became knowledgeable in the field of traditional medicine and massage
 kalari payat shikshak aksar chaatro ke shaareerik lacheelepan yaa prashikshan ke samay lagi mansapeshi kii chot kaa ilaaj karne ke liye aushadhiy telon se unki maalish karte hai

 All eight postures are based on animals
 haalanki ab abhyaas satr main inkaa istemaal nahin hota, lekin hathiyaar kalari payat kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa hai
 This is especially true for the Northern style which is mostly weapon-based

 Sugauli Treaty is a treaty signed between the East India Company and the King of Nepal, which was brought into existence after the british-nepalese War of 1814–16
 is sandhi par 2 disambar 1815 ko hastakshrar kiye gayi or 4 march 1816 kaa iskaa anumodan kiya gaya
 It was signed by Raj Guru Gajraj Mishra on behalf of Nepal and Lieutenant Colonel Paris Bradshaw on behalf of the company
 is sandhi ke anusaar nepal ke kuch hisson ko british bharat main shaamil karne, kathmandu main ek british pratinidhi kii niyukti or britain kii sainya seva main gorkhaon ko bhartee karne kii anumati di gayi thi, saath hi iske dwaara nepal ne apni kisi bhi seva main kisi america yaa europea karmchaaree ko niyukt karne kaa adhikaar bhi kho diya
 Under the treaty, Nepal lost about one-third of its territory, which included areas won by the king of Nepal in the last 25 years, such as Sikkim in the east, Kumaon and Garhwal monarchies in the west and most of the Terai region in the south
 
 tarai bhoomi kaa kuch hissaa 1816 main hi nepal ko lautaa diya gaya
 In 1860 a large tract of Terai land was returned to Nepal in return for helping the British suppress the Indian Revolt of 1857

 In December 1923 the Sugauli Treaty was superseded and promoted in the "treaty of Sustainable Peace and Friendship", and the status of the British Resident was increased from representative to envoy
 1950 main bharat or nepal ne ek nayi sandhi par do swatantra deshon ke rup main hastakshar kiye gaye jiskaa uddeshy donon deshon ke bich sambandhon ko ek nae sire se sthapit karnaa tha
 The treaty was signed by the East India Company and the Gorkha monarchy of Nepal in 1816 to end the two-year-long british-nepalese war
 is sandhi ke tahat, mithila kshetra kaa ek hissaa bharat se alag hokar nepal ke adhikaar kshetra main chalaa gaya
 This part is called Eastern Terai or Mithila, in Nepal

 These territories were conquered by Nepal during the last nearly 25 years, which were returned to India after the treaty
 british-nepali yuddh ke baad, nepal sarkaar or east india company ke bich shanti or maitri kii ek sandhi par hastakshar kiye gayi
 On 2 December 1815, the treaty was signed on behalf of the Government of Nepal by Raj Guru Gajraj Mishra, whose assistant was Chandra Shekhar Upadhyay and on behalf of the company by Lieutenant Colonel Paris Bradshaw
 4 march 1816 ko chandra shekhar upaadhyaay or general david octerloni dwaara makwanpur main sandhi kii hastakshrit pratiyon kaa aadan pradaan kiya gaya
 The terms of the treaty were as follows: - iske baad disambar 1816 main ek uttargami samjhaute par sahmati bani jiske anusaar nepal ko mechi nadi ke purv or mahakali nadi ke pashchim ke bich kaa tarai kshetra waapas lautaa diya gaya
 As a result of this agreement the provision of compensation amounting to two lakh rupees per annum was abolished
 ek bhoomi surveykshan ke dwaara donon rashtron ke bich kii seemaa ko tay karne kaa prastaav bhi sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 Because the national delimitation was not clarified in this treaty, its effect continues to this day: 04-05 march 2016 ko sugauli sandhi ke do sau saal puure hone ke avasar par bihar kii saamaajik sanstha "bhor" or press club dwaara yojit sugauli sandhi samaaroh main ramesh chandra jha dwaara likhit "swadhinata samar main : sugauli" pustak kaa punarprakashan or vimochan ke saath saath har saal lekhakon or patrakaron ko "ramesh chandra jha smriti puraskaar" diya jaayegaa

 isaki kahani tab shuru hoti he, jab anjaane main shekhar galati se rohit ko takkar maar detaa he, jisase uske haath main rakhe saare kaagaj udne lagate hai
 Shekhar leaves from there in a hurry, and one of those papers stops in Sanjana's face
 is tarah rohit or sanjana kii mulaaqaat hoti he or donon jald hi ek duusare se pyaar karne lagate hai
 One day Shekhar and Sanjana meet in the train
 is baat se anjaan ki wo pehle se kisi or se pyaar karti he, wo use pataane kii koshish karte rahata he
 She later learns that she is in love with Rohit
 uske baad use pataa chalata he ki rohit kii maut ho chuki he
 Sanjana returns to her home
 shekhar uske ghar kaa pataa hasil kar raat ko jab uske ghar aata he to duhkhi sanjana ko ek pal ke liye andhere main lagata he ki rohit waapas aa gaya or wo daud kar uske gale lag jaati he, par jaise hi roshni waapas aa jaati he, to wo shekhar ko dekh kar gussa ho jaati he
 Shekhar decides to stay in front of her house hungry stomach for seven days to win her heart
 har din wo use ek ek khat main uske saat aashcharya ke bare main bataane lagata he
 But after completing 6 days, when Sanjana looks outside in the morning of the 7th day, she does not appear there
 wo bhaagate hue use dhundne lagati he or kuch duuri par wo jaataa hua dikhataa he
 She asks him to ask why he was going without waiting another day, then he says that he now understood the reason for leaving a day before the soldier's 100th day was completed in the story of soldier and princess
 Gone
 wo is kaaran bas ek din puure hone se pehle hi chalaa gaya tha, kyonki agar sau din puure hone ke baad bhi rajkumaari use nahin milti to uskaa dil tut jaataa, or agar wo usase ek din pehle hi chale jaataa he to use aisa lagate rahegaa ki ek din or ruk jaataa to wo aa jaati
 Sanjana then says that have you thought about that princess "what would she do after she was told one day before? She would keep thinking about that soldier all her life and keep waiting for him
" chaahe us kahani kaa ant kuch bhi ho, par main wo rajkumaari nahin bananaa chaahati

 Concorde was the first airliner to have a fly-by-wire flight-control system; The Concorde airplane was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to have hybrid circuits
 is pariyojna ke pramukh diziner piyare saatre the, jinke up diziner the sar archibald rasel
 Concorde pioneered the following technologies: udaan kii ucch gati or anukulan ke liye: For weight saving and enhanced performance: jab koi vimaan us vishisht airfrem kaa kranthik maakh ko paar karata he, tab dabaav kaa centre peeche kii ore khisakta he
 This causes the pitch downward force on the plane, because the center of mass remains in its place

 However, a deviation of about 2 m remained

 For optimum supersonic flight, turbofan engines were considered, but rejected because of their large transverse cut, which could cause excessive dredging
 terbojet injanon ke liye sabase achche vikalp paae gaye
 The engine developed was the development of twin spool rolls-royce / Snekma Olympus 593 Bristol engines, first used for avro-vulcan bombers and developed as a supersonic adaptation of the bomber BAC TSR-2
 concord ingine kaa antargrahan dizine mahatvapurn tha
 All conventional jet engines can only carry air around 0
5 mah; Therefore the air has to be slowed by the Mak 2,0 wind that enters the engine intake
 vishesh rup se, concord ko injanon ko kshati se bachaane ke liye, gati kii kami se utpann hone vaale aghat tarangon ko niyantrit karne kii jarurat thi
 This was done by a pair of ingestion ramps and an auxiliary spill gate, whose location was moved during the flight to slow the wind down
 ramp ingine dibbe ke upar the or neeche khiskaae gaye or sahaayak spil dwaar upar or neeche donon ore gatisheel rahaa, jisase hawa kaa andar or baahar pravaah anumat ho sakaa
 The effectiveness of the ingestion system is such that during supersonic flight, 63% of the aircraft is attributed to its intake for thrust, while the tonts account for 29% of the thrust and engines only 8%
 gave rise
 ingine vifaltaa paaramparik sabsonic vimaan ke liye samasyaayein utpann karti hai; vimaan na keval us disha main jor ko khota he balki ingine talkarshan bhi utpann karata he, jisase vimaan main vichlan paidaa hota he or vah vifal ingine kii disha main karavat letaa he
 If this happens with the Concorde at supersonic speed, then theoretically it becomes an accidental failure factor of the airframe
 tathaapi, ingine kii vifaltaa ke dauraan hawa ke antargrahan kii zarurat lagbhag shunya rahati he, atah concord main ingine vifaltaa ke tatkaal prabhaavon ko sahaayak spil dwaaron ke khulne or rampon ke sampurna vistaar dwaara roka gaya, jo hawa ko neeche kii ore ingine ke paar vichlit karata he or uthaan arjeet karte hue or ingine ko sidh main laate hue, vifal ingine ke talkarshan prabhaav ko kam kiya
 Although computer simulation predicted substantial difficulties, Concorde in practice was able to shut down both engines in the same direction of the aircraft at 2 mah without any prior control problems
 concord payalton ko donon injanon kii vifaltaa se nipatane ke liye anurupanon main niyamit taur par prashikshit kiya gaya
 The aircraft used retort to take over from the transonic system at takeoff and between 0
95 mach and 1
7 mah, and on other occasions the switches were switched off
 jet injanon ke dhimi gati par atyadhik aksham hone ke kaaran, concord ranve par 2 ton eendhan chaalan kharch kiya
 Only two external engines were run after landing to limit fuel
 do injanon se jor, gantavy par utarane par vimaan ke kam vajan ke kaaran ramp par chalaane ke liye paryaapt tha
 Apart from the engine, the most prominent part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is its nose
 The engineers wanted to use duralumin, which is an aluminum alloy, in terms of cost and ease of construction for the entire aircraft
 vimaan ke jivan-kaal main aluminium dwaara sahan kar sakane yogya ucchtam taapmaana 127 °C tha, jisane sheersh gati ko 2
02 maakh tak simit kiya
 Concorde undergoes two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, cooling first when attaining altitude, then heating after becoming supersonic
 The opposite happened while descending
 ise dhaatukarm modelling main kaarak bananaa hi tha
 a test rig was constructed which repeatedly heated the entire section of the wing and then cooled it and metal samples were taken periodically for testing

 cabin thanda rakhane ke liye, concord ne air condishning se garmi ke liye taapak hauz ke rup main eendhan kaa istemaal kiya, isi paddati ne hydraliks ko thanda kiya
 During supersonic flight the surfaces ahead of the cockpit were heated, using a façade to deflect this heat from reaching the cockpit directly
 concord kaa parichhadon par bhi pratibandh tha; sataha ke adhikansh hisse ko 2 maakh ke supersonic taapan prabhaavon ke kaaran aluminium sanrachana ko atitaap se bachaane ke liye behad safed rang pratibimbit karne vaale rang se rangana padaa
 tathaapi, 1996 main air frans ne alpakaal ke liye F-BTSD ko pepsy cola ke saath prachaar saude ke bhaag ke rup main, mukhyatah nile rang main ranga
 is rang yojana main, air frans ko 20 se andhik minuton ke liye 2 maakh par bane rahane kii salaah di gai, lekin 1
7 maakh ke tahat gati par koi pratibandh nahin tha
 The F-BTSD was chosen for the promotion because the aircraft was not scheduled to operate any longer flights that would require extensive 2M operations
 concord jis ucch gati par yatra karata tha, chadhaai or ghumaavon ke dauraan vimaan kii sanrachana main zyaada bal lagu kiye gaye the
 This caused cramps and deformation in the aircraft structure

 iske atirikt, sankeern dhad kaa matlab he ki vimaan mud jayega
 yah peeche ke yatriyon ke drushtikon se dikhaai detaa tha
 Due to the high average takeoff speed of 250 mph, the Concorde needed advanced brakes
 adhikansh vimaanon kii tarah, concord main phislan virdohi braking maujuud he - ek pranali jo y role-out ke dauraan adhik niyantran ke liye jab brake lagaae jaaen, tiron ko karshan se roktaa he
 The brakes, developed by Dunlop, were the first carbon-based brakes used on aircraft
 ve concord ko ek nishphal techof se mile ke andar roak sake, jab uskaa vazan 185 ton tha or vah 190 mile prati ghanta par yatra kar rahaa tha
 Another issue that opened up during development was Avachakra
 jis tareeqe se concord kaa delta-wing upar uthta tha, avachakra ko asaamaanya rup se majboot hona hi tha
 In rotation, the Concorde will be elevated at an aggressive high angle by approximately 18 degrees
 Unlike the wings of conventional aircraft before rotation, the wing generated almost no lift
 parikraman par ucch vayugati se sanyukt hokar, isane peeche ke avachakra par jor badha diya or baad main pramukh punardizine kii aavashyaktaa hui
 The inclination of the rear subcircles accumulates towards each other, but due to their greater height it is necessary to telescopically fold before swinging to avoid collecting towards each other
 concord ko bina ruke landan or neuyork yaa washington ke bich yatra karne kii zarurat thi or ise hasil karne ke liye dizineron ne concord ko kisi anya vimaan kii apeksha adhiktam supersonic range di
 It carefully envisages the use of a thinner structure and wing shape to provide good lift and curb ratios, including balanced weight and high fuel efficiency, and caution of engines by moving fuel to make the aircraft thinner without introducing additional dredging
 Was possible with development to make them more efficient at supersonic speeds
 phir bhi, concord dwaara udaan bharne ke turant baad, sabhi gatiyon par airodinamik kaary-nishpaadan main sudhaar karne ke liye kuch adhik eendhan kshamta or agrim dhar pattiyon sahit thode bade pankhons ke saath ek concord "B" model pariklpit kiya gaya
 In this it will play in a more powerful engine with deadening reheating without sound and fuel hunger and noise
 It was speculated that it was reasonable to make an engine with possible 593 rolls-royce / Snecma Olympus to achieve more efficiency of 25%
 This would have given 500 miles additional range with payload even more and would have made new commercial routes possible
 is bhaag main kaaran radd kar diya gaya concord bikri ke garib ke liye, lekin 1970 ke dashak badhati eendhan main vimaanan laagat kaa bhi
 The high altitude at which passengers obtained the cruised flight of the Concorde means the extraterrestrial flow of approximately twice as long as those ionizing radiation on a conventional long-haul trip

 The meaning of the word Pratishyakhya means: "the scripture or study pertaining to the Tattatta branch"
 yahan "shakha" se abhipraay vedon kii shakhaon se he
 The subjects related to Vedic branches could be many
 udaahranarth, prayek vaidic shakha se sambhddha karmkand, aachaar aadi kii apni apni parampara thi
 The subjects were not related to all those subjects, but only to the pure pronunciation of the Vedic mantras, subjects such as the Vedic codes and their textual readings, etc
, or the interrelationship of the vocalizations and sometimes the verses
 shiksha, vyakaran ke aitihaasik vikaas ke adhyayan kii drushti se or sambandhit vaidic samhitaon ke paramparaprapt paath kii suraksha ke liye bhi praatishakhyon kaa atyant mahatv he
 Here it is necessary to briefly understand the beginning, form and trend of Vedic branches
 bhartiya vaidic samskruti ke itihaas main ek samay aisa aayaa jabaki vaidic manishiyon ne paramparaprapt vaidic mantron ko vaidic samhitaon ke rup main sangruhit kiya
 The basis of the study at that time was oral only
 guru shishy kii shravan parampara dwaara hi vaidic samhitaon kii raksha ho sakati thi
 The Vedic codes became different branches from Deshbhed and Kalbhed respectively
 vaidic mantron or unki samhitaon ko prarambh se hi arya jati kii pavithratam nidhi samajha jaataa rahaa he
 The Aryan mystics have always been paying attention to their safety and study
 isi drushti ne bharat main veda ke shadangon ko janm diya tha
 Vedic scholars created the textual textual footsteps from the point of view of security and economics of Vedic codes
 kuch kaal ke ananthar kramash: krampath aadi paathon kaa bhi prarambh hua
 Along with the development of the Vedic intrigues, each branch tried to protect the pure pronunciation of the Vedic codes in their own tradition and with the help of the text and as much as possible the form of each verse of the Veda and those occurring in the Code Accurately study the variances and alterations of the terms
 mulat: praatishakhyon kaa vishay yahi tha
 Sometimes, a scholastic study also came under the purview of Pratyakshaya
 vaidic shakhaon ke adhyetruvarg "charan" kehalaate the
 The Vidhyathasabhas or Vidyasabhas of these stages were called "councils"
 pratishaakhyon kii rachana praaia: sutara style main kii jaati thi isiilie praatishakhyon ke liye praayen "parshadsutra" kaa bhi vyavhaar pracheen granthon main miltaa he
 It is said in Yaskacharya's Nirukta: arthath, padon ke aadhaar par samhita rahati he or sab shakhaon ke pratishaakhyon kii pravriti padon ko hi samhita kaa aadhaar maanakar hui he
 This makes a sound that in ancient times all the Vedic branches must have had their own idols
 sambhavat: vaidic shakhaon samaan, unke praatishakhya bhi lupt ho gaye
 The current available specific parameters are given below
 spashtat: iskaa sambandh rugveda kii samhita se he
 But according to tradition, it is related to the inverse inferior branch of the Rigvedic branch
 praatishakhyon main yah sabase bada praatishakhya he or kai drushtiyon se apana vishesh mahatv rakhata he
 It has three chapters of six tables each
 yahan or praatishakhya sutara style main hai, vahaan yah padyon main nirmit he
 But the interpreters have divided the verses into pieces and interpreted them in the same form
 is praatishakhya ke pratham 1-15 adhyyon main shiksha or vyakaran se sambandhit vishyon kaa pratipaadan he or ant ke teen adhyyon main chhandon kii charchaa he
 The rendering of the subject of the verses, it is a matter of keeping in mind, is not in any other aspect
 krampath kaa vistrut pratipaadan bhi is praatishakhya kaa ek ullekhneey vaishishty he
 The ancient evocative commentary is famous on this pattern
 iskaa professor em
e
 reniye dwaara kiya gaya french bhashaa main tathaa pro maxmular dwaara kiya gaya german bhashaa main anuwaad uplabdh hai
 It is related to Shukla Yajurveda
 yah sutarastyli main nirmit he
 It has eight chapters
 praatishakhyiya vishay ke saath isamen padon ke swar kaa vidhaan or padpath main avagrah ke niyam vishesh rup se die gaye hai
 a peculiarity of this pattern is also that it has many artificial nouns like "sim", "jit", like nouns like Ghu, d of Panini
 iske "tasminniti nirdishte purvasy' aadi anek sutara panini ke sutron se abhinn hai
 Along with many other ancient Acharyas, there is mention of Shaunak Acharya in them
 isapar bhi anya tikaaon ke saath saath uvat kii pracheen vyakhya prasiddh he
 Its professor A
 Waver is available in German language
 iskaa sambandh krishna yajurveda kii taittiriya shakha se he
 It is also manufactured in sutra style
 isamen 24 adhyay hai
 There is a special discussion of the text along with the general theoretical topic
 isaki ek visheshta yah he ki isamen 20 pracheen aacharyon kaa ullekh he
 Many ancient interpretations of it, the Tribhasyaratna are famous
 iskaa professor hvitni krit angreji anuwaad uplabdh hai
 Its critical edition, including an English translation, was published in 1862 by Prof
 Whitney
 iskaa sambandh atharvaveda kii shaunak shakha se he
 It is also in sutra style and in four chapters
 inke atirikt riktantr naam se ek sam praatishakhya tathaa teen prapathkon main ek doosraa atharv praatishakhya bhi prakashit ho chuke hai
 The composition of the principals is pre-dated to Panini Acharya
 unki sari drushti panini vyakaran se purv kii dikhti he
 It is possible that Panini grammar has some influence on their available texts, but this is in a very small amount
 yah samaran rakhane kii baat he ki mahabhashya main panineey vyakaran ko sarv-veda-parishad shaastra kaha he
 Although scholarly studies, especially Western scholars, have shown special interest in the critical study and publication of the epigraphs, deprivation and diabolism seem to be increasing in the tradition of the study of these texts over the centuries
 yahi kaaran he ki praatishakhyon main or unki vyakhyaon main bhi anek paath ashuddh yaa aspasht hai
 This is the reason why a great text like Sayan Bhasya of Rigveda Samhita does not even mention Rig Vedapratisakhya even once and in many places, many verses have been tried to prove the treaty by the forced Paninisutra
 aavashyaktaa he ki praatishakhyon ke prakaash main vaidic samhitaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaae

 raajnneetik or aadhyatmik rup se shiya or sunni donon ke liye ali mahatvapurn he
 Many biographical sources about Ali are often biased according to sectarian lines, but they agree that he was a pious Muslim, who was a ruler because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah
 jabaki sunise ali ko rashidun khalif ke chauthe or final par vichaar karte hai, shiya musalamaanon ne ali ko gadir khum main ghatnaon kii vyakhya ke kaaran mohammad ke baad pehali imam ke rup main mana
 Shia Muslims also believe that Ali and other Shia are members of the Imam) are the rightful heirs to Muhammad
 yah asahmati thi ki umah ko shiya or sunni shakhaon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha
 Ali's father, Abu Talib, was the patron of the Kaaba of Banu Hashim, an important branch of the powerful Qureshi tribe and was a sheikh

 " Ali escaped the plot, but risked his life again by living in Mecca to carry out Muhammad's instructions: to restore all the goods and properties entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping to their owners

 The order of this mushaf differed from that which was later gathered during the Uthmanic era
 is pustak ko kai logon ne khaarij kar diya jab unhone unhen dikhaaya
 Despite this, Ali made no resistance against the standardized mus'haf
 apane jivan ke aakhri saalon main arab janajatiyon ko ek muslim dharmik raajnneeti main ekajute karne ke baad, 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ne is baat par asahmati vyakt kii ki muslim samudaay ke netaa ke rup main unhen koun safal karegaa
 While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing their bodies for burial, a small group of Muslims took part in Saqifah, one of Muhammad's close companions, Abu Bakr, was named to lead the community
 dusron ne apana samarthan joda or abu bakar ko pehla khalipha banaaya gaya tha
 The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who said that Ali was nominated by Muhammad as his successor
 baad main jab fatimah or ali ne khalipha ke adhikaar ke maamle main sahaygiyon se sahaayta maangi, to unhone uttar diya, 'he bhagwaan ke macenjar kii beti! hamane abu bakar ko apana nishtha diya he
 If Ali had come to us earlier, we certainly would not have abandoned him
 ali ne kaha, 'kya yah uchit tha ki paigambar ko dafnaae jane se pehle hamen khalipha par jhagada karnaa chahie?' After the Khilafat election, Abu Bakr and Umar along with some other companions went to Fatima's house to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered to pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr
 phir, yah aarope lagaaya gaya he ki umr ne aag lagane kii dhamkee di thi jab tak ve baahar nahin aae or abu bakar ke prati nishtha kii kasam khai
 Fatima, in support of her husband, triggered a seduction and threatened to "expose her hair", to which Abu Bakr repented and withdrew
 ali ne baar-baar kaha he ki unke saath chalis purush the, unhone virodh kiya hoga
 Ali did not actively assert his authority because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into conflict
 anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne umr ke chayan ko khalipha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya or yahaan tak ki unki betiyon um kulthum ko shaadi main bhi diya
 This controversial issue later divided Muslims into two groups, Sunni and Shia
 sunnis ne jor dekar kaha ki mohammad ne kabhi uttaradhikari niyukt nahin kiya he, phir bhi abu bakar muslim samudaay dwaara pehle khalif chune gaye the
 Sunnis identify the first four Caliphs as the rightful successors of Muhammad
 shiyas kaa maananaa he ki mohammad ne spasht rup se ali ko gadir khum main unke uttaradhikari ke rup main namit kiya or muslim netritv unase sambandhit tha jo divya aadesh dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye the
 According to Wilferd Madelung, Ali himself was convinced of his legitimacy for the Caliph based on his close association with Muhammad, his close relationship and his knowledge of Islam and his qualifications in serving his virtues
 unhone abu bakar se kaha ki khalipha ke rup main nishtha ko pratigya karne main unki deree unke pehle ke sheershak kii unki dharna par aadhaarit thi
 Ali ultimately pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and Uthman, but did so for the unity of Islam, once it became clear that the Muslims had turned away from him
 ali ne yah bhi mana ki vah is ladaai ke bina imamet kii apni bhoomika puri kar saktaa he
 At the beginning of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr, there was a dispute between Muhammad's daughter, especially Phadak, Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other
 fatima ne abu bakar se apni sampatti, fada or khayabar kii bhoomi ko badalane ke liye kaha 
 But Abu Bakr refused and told him that the prophets had no inheritance and that Phadak belonged to the Muslim community
 abu bakar ne usase kaha, "allaah ke prerit ne kaha, hamaare uttaradhikari nahin hai, jo kuch bhi ham chhodte hai vah sadaaka he 
 "together with Umm Ayman, Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad gave it to Fatima Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested him to summon witnesses for his claim
 fatima gusse main ho gai or abu bakar se baat karnaa band kar diya, or jab tak vah mar gai, tab tak vah ravaiya maanate rahe
 'aisha also states that "when the Apostle of Allah died, his wives asked Uthman to send Abu Bakr to ask for his share of the inheritance
 " tab 'aisha ne unase kaha, "kya allaah ke prerit ne nahin kaha,' hamaari sampatti viraasat main nahin he, or jo bhi ham chhodte hai vah daan main kharch kiya janaa chahie?" According to some sources, Ali did not swear allegiance to Abu Bakr sometime after the death of his wife Fatima in the year 633
 'ali ne abu bakar ke antim sanskaar main bhaag liya
 He pledged allegiance to the second Khalifa Umar ibn Khattab and helped him as a trusted advisor
 umr vishesh rup se ali par madina ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke rup main nirbhar tha
 He advised Umar to set the hijra as the beginning of the Islamic calendar

 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's son-in-law
 iske alaava, umr ne abdur rahamaan ko casting vot diya
 Abdur Rahman offered the Caliph to Ali on the condition that he should rule according to the Quran, the example set by Muhammad, and the precedent set by the first two Caliphs
 ali ne teesri shart se inkaar kar diya jabaki uthman ne use sweekaar kar liya
 His reputation at the summit of Ilokens Ali was emphasized according to the comments of Ilon Abi al-hadid, but most voters reluctantly urged Uthman and Ali to support him
 'uthman ebn' afaan ne apane rishtedaar banu abd-shams kii ore udaartaa vyakt kii, jo unke upar haaavee hone lagate the, or abu dhar al-ghifaari, abd-allaah ebn masood or amaar jaise kai shuruaati saathi ke prati unke ghamandi durvyavhaar ebn yasir ne logon ke kuch samoohon ke bich apmaan ko uksaaya
 Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose in most of the empire from 650–651 onwards
 unke shashan or unke dwaara niyukt sarkaron ke saath asantosh arab ke baahar praanton tak hi simit nahin tha
 When Uthman's relatives, especially Marwan, gained control over him, the Great Council, which included most of the members of the Voters' Council, turned against him or at least withdrew his support, pressuring the Caliphate and his ways
 Reducing the impact of your firm relationship
 is samay, ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 On several occasions Ali disagreed with Udhaman in the application of Hudud; He had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dhrr al-ghifari and spoke strongly in defense of Ammar ibn Yasir
 unhone uthman ko anya sahyogiyon kii aalochanaon ke bare main bataaya or uthman kii taraf se prantiy virodhiyon ke saath vaartakar ke rup main kaary kiya jo madina aae the; is vajah se ali or uthman ke parivaar ke bich kuch avishvaas utpann hua prathit hota he
 Eventually, he tried to reduce the severity of the siege with his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water
 itihaaskaaron ke bich ali or uthman ke bich sambandhon ke bare main vivaad he
 Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies
 vishesh rup se, unhone dharmik kanoon ke sawaal par uthman ke saath sangharsh kiya
 He insisted that religious punishment should be done in many cases like Ubaid Allah ibn Umar and Walid ibn Ukba
 tirthayatra ke dauraan 650 main, unhone uthman se prarthana anushthan ke parivartan ke liye apmaan ke saath saamana kiya
 When Uthman announced that he would take whatever he had from the fees, Ali said that the caliph would be forced into that case
 ali ne ebn masood jaise khalipha dwaara maatrutiv se saathi kii raksha karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Therefore, some historians consider Ali as one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the chief
 lekin wilferd madelangais tathy ke kaaran unke faisle ko khaarij kar diya gaya ki ali ke paas khalipha ke rup main chune jane ke liye kuraishi kaa samarthan nahin tha
 According to him, there is no evidence that Ali had close ties with the rebels who supported his caliphate or directed his actions
 kuch anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 However, Madelang told Marwan that Ali's grandson Zayn al-abidin had said that koi bhi aapke guru kii tulana main hamaare guru kii tulana main adhik samshitoshna tha
 During one of the most difficult periods in Muslim history, Ali was the Caliph between 656 and 661, which also coincided with the first Fitnah
 chunki jin sangharshon main ali shaamil the, ve dhruviya sampradayik itihaslekh main kaayam the, jeevani saamagree aksar pakshpatpurna hoti he
 But the sources agree that he was a deeply religious man, who was ruled by justice because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah; He was engaged in a war against Muslims in terms of religious duties
 sutron ne apane tapasya, dharmik kartavyon kaa kathor paalan, or sansaarik vastuon se alag hone par notice main ullekh kiya he
 Thus some authors have reported that they lack political skills and flexibility
 uthman kii hatya kaa matlab tha ki vidrohiyon ko ek nayaa khalipha chunanaa padaa
 This met with difficulties as the rebels were divided into several groups including Muhajirun, Ansar, Egyptians, Kufans and Basarites
 teen ummidavaar the: ali, talhah or al-jubayr 
 First the rebels approach Ali, requesting him to be the fourth Caliph
 mohammad ke kuch saathi ne ali ko karyaalay sweekaar karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii, lekin unhone prastaav ko band kar diya, ek pramukh ke bajaay paramarshdaata hone kaa suzav diya
 Talha, Zubayr, and other companions refused the Khalifa's offer of rebels
 isliye, vidrohiyon ne madina ke nivaasiyon ko ek din ke bheetar ek khalipha chunane kii chetavanee di, yaa ve kathor karrwai lagu karenge
 To resolve the deadlock, Muslims gathered at al-masjid an-nabawi on June 18, 656 to appoint a caliph
 prarambh main, 'ali ne ise sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki sirf unke sabase shashakt samarthak vidrohiyon the
 However, when some of Muhammad's notable companions other than the residents of Medina urged him to accept the offer, he eventually agreed
 abu mekhanaaf ke mutabikka varnan, talhah pehle pramukh saathi the jinhone 'ali ko apana pratigya di, lekin anya kathaon ne anyathaa daawa kiya ki unhen apni pratigya dene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In addition, Talhah and az-zubayr later claimed that they reluctantly supported him
 bhale hi, ali ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya, jor dekar kaha ki unhone unhen sleep swechha se manyata di he
 Wilferd Madelung believes the force did not urge people to pledge and publicly pledged at the mosque
 jabaki madina kii aabaadi ke saath-saath kai vidrohiyon ne apni pratigya di, kuch mahatvapurn aankade yaa janajatiyon ne aisa nahin kiya
 Uthman's relatives fled to the Umayyad Levant, or remained in their homes, later denying 'ali's legitimacy'
 saad ebn abi vakkaas anupasthit the or 'abdulla ebn' umr ne apane nishtha kii peshkash karne se roak diya, lekin donon ne 'ali ko aashwaasan diya ki ve unke khilaaf kaary nahin karenge
 Ali thus inherited the Rashidun Caliphate — which stretched from Egypt in the west to the Iranian hills in the east — while the situation in Hejaz and other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled
 ali khalipha banane ke turant baad, unhone prantiy governron ko khaarij kar diya jinhen uthman ne niyukt kiya tha, unhen bharosemand sahyogiyon ke saath badal diya tha
 He acted against the lawyers of Mugira ibn Shuba and Ibn Abbas, who had carefully advised them to proceed with their rule
 madelang kaa kahana he ki ali apane adhikaar or unke dharmik mishan se gaharaai se aashwast the, raajnneetik yogyata ke liye apane siddhanton se samjhauta karne ke icchhuk nahin the, or baari baadhaon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye taiyaar the
 Mu'awiyah I, the founder of Uthman and the governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; He was the only governor to do so
 hagiya sophia main islamic sulekh ke saath ali kaa naam, jab unhen khalipha niyukt kiya gaya, ali ne madina ke nagarikon se kaha ki muslim raajnneeti asantosh or vivaad se peedit hui he; vah kisi bhi buraai ke islam ko shuddh karnaa chahta tha
 He advised the population to behave as true Muslims, warning that it would not tolerate any treason and that those found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly
 aaisha, talha, al-zubair or umayyadon, vishesh rup se muawiyah i or maravan main, dangaiyon jo maar daalaa tha dandit karne ke liye karnaa chahta tha 'ali uthman
 They camped close to Basra
 vaarta kai dinon tak chali or baad main garam vinimay or parali ke dauraan virodh pradarshnon se uda, jisase donon taraf jivan kii haani hui
 The battle of camels in confusion began in 656, where Ali emerged victorious
 kuch itihaaskaar maanate hai ki unhone is mudde kaa istemaal apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko khojane ke liye kiya kyonki unhen ali ke khalipha apane phaayde ke khilaaf mila
 The rebels said that Uthman was executed for not ruling according to the Quran and Sunnah, so no retaliation was to be done
 kuch log kehete hai ki khalipha vidrohiyon kaa uphaar tha or ali ke paas unhen niyantrit karne yaa dandit karne ke liye paryaapt bal nahin tha, jabaki anya kehete hai ki ali ne vidrohiyon ke tark ko sweekaar kiya yaa kam se kam vichaar nahin kiya uthman ek shaasha shaasha
 Under such circumstances, a dispute ensued that started the first civil war in Muslim history
 uthamanion ke naam se jane vaale kuch musalamaanon ne uthman ko ant tak ek sahi or sirf khalipha mana, jise avaidh tareeke se maar diya gaya tha
 Some others, known as Ali's party, believed that Uthman had fallen into error, seized the caliphate and refused to reform or step in their own way legally
 Was executed in law; Thus Ali was just and true Imam and atheists among his opponents
 yah khud ali kii sthiti nahin thi
 This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community who had legitimate authority to occupy the Caliphate
 pratham fitnaa, 656-661, uthman kii hatya ke baad, ali ke khalipha ke dauraan jari rakhaa, or khalipha ke muavia kii dharna dwaara samaapt kiya gaya tha
 This civil war is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic Ummah
 ali ne basra ke governor 'abd allaah ebn al'-abbaas niyukt kiye or iraq main muslim garrison shahar kupha main apni rajdhani chali gai
 After the roman-persian Wars and the Byzantine Sasani War that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep-rooted differences between Iraq, formally in the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire
 iraqi chaahate the ki nae sthapit islamic rajya kii rajdhani kupha main ho taaki ve apane kshetra main rajasav laa saken or syria kaa virodh kar saken
 He convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish a capital at Kufa in Iraq
 baad main levant ke governor muvayah pratham or uthman ke chachere bhai ne ali kii nishtha kii maangon se inkaar kar diya
 Ali opened up hopes of regaining his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule
 muvayah ne apane laventine samarthakon ko sangathit karke or ali ko shradhanjali arpit karne se inkaar kar diya ki unke dal ne apane chunaav main bhaag nahin liya tha
 Ali shifted his forces to the north and the two armies encamped themselves in Siffin for more than a hundred days, most of the time being spent in conversation
 yadhyapi ali ne muvayah ke saath kai patron kaa aadan-pradaan kiya, lekin vah uttararddh ko khaarij karne main asamarth tha, na hi use nishtha dene kaa vachan dene ke liye raji kiya
 a confrontation between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657
 ek saptaah ke yuddh ke baad ek hinsak ladaai ke baad lalit al-harir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, muvayah kii sena margauntarit hone ke bindu par thi jab amrit ebn al-aas ne muvayah ko apane sainikon ko oochhaalane kii salaah di thi 
 Ali watched through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to chase the fight
 aakhir main do senaayen is baat ko sulajhane ke liye sahamat huin ki madhyasthata se khalipha koun hona chahie
 The refusal of the largest block in Ali's army to fight was the deciding factor in the acceptance of arbitration
 sawaal yah he ki kya madhyasth ali yaa kufaan kaa pratinidhitiv karegaa, ali kii sena main aage vibhaajan hua he
 Ashath ibn q and some others rejected Ali's candidates as 'abd Allah ibn' Abbas and Malik al-ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ashari for his neutrality
 ant main, ali ko abu musa ko sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Amrit ibn al-a was appointed by Mu'awiyah as a mediator
 saat maheene baad do madhyasthon ne farvari 658 main jordan main maan ke uttar pashchim main 10 mile uttar pashchim main mulaakaat kii
 Amrit ibn al-abu Musa Ashari assured that both Ali and Mu'awiyah should step in and elect a new caliph
 ali or unke samarthak is faisle se dar gaye the, jisane khalipha ko vidrohi muvayah kii sthiti main kam kar diya tha
 Therefore Ali was called by Mu'awiyah and Amr ibn al-s
 jab daumit-ul-jandal main madhyasthon ne ikattha kiya, to unke liye maamalon kii charchaa karne ke liye dainik baithkon kii ek shrinkhalaa kii vyavastha kii gai
 When it came time to make a decision about the Caliph, Amrit bin al-aas convinced Abu Musa al-ashari to entertain that he should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the Caliphate, and the Muslims to make elections
 The Caliph Abu Musa al-ashari also decided to act accordingly
 punavala ke anusaar, aisa lagata he ki madhyasthon ke bahishkaar ke saath madhyasth or anya pratishthit vyaktiyon ne janvari 65 9 main nae khalif ke chayan par charchaa ke liye mulaakaat kii
 Amrit supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law Abdullah ibn Umar, but the latter unanimously refused to stand for election
 abu musa ne prastaavit kiya, or amrit sahamat hue, ali or muvayah donon ko chhodane or shura ko nae khalif kaa chayan jamaa karne ke liye sahamat hue
 The public declaration after Abu Musa saw his share of the pact, but Amrit declared Ali and confirmed Muawiya as the Caliph
 ali ne unke faisle ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya or chunaav hone ke liye or madhyasthata kaa paalan karne ke liye apane pratigya kaa ulanghan karne main takneekee rup se paaya
 Ali protested, stating that it was not binding on the contrary to the Quran and Sunnah
 phir usne ek nai sena ko vyavasthit karne kii koshish kii, lekin malik ashtar kii aguai main kurr ke avshesh ansaar, or unke kuch kulon ne vafaadaar bane rahe
 This also put Ali in a vulnerable position among his supporters
 madhyasthata ke parinamswaroop 'ali ke gathbandhan ke vighatan main, or kuch ne kaha he ki yah muvayah kaa iraadaa tha
 The most vocal opponents in Ali's camp were the same people who forced Ali into a ceasefire
 unhone ali ke bal se tod diya, naaraazgi ke tahat raily "madhyasthata akele bhagwaan se sambandhit he
 “this group came to be known as Kharijites
 unhone sabhi ko apana dushman mana
 In 659 Ali's army and Kharijites met at the Battle of Naharvan
 tab kurra kharijiyon ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims
 unhone kisi aise vyakti ko mana jo avishvasi ke rup main apane samooh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 Although 'ali won the battle by a large margin, the constant struggle was beginning to affect his position
 iraqiyon se nipatane ke dauraan, ali ko ek anushaasit sena or prabhavi rajya sansthaanon kaa nirmaan karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 He spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites
 natijatan, 'ali ko apane purvi morche par rajya kaa vistaar karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Around the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt
 misr ke rajyapal, kus ko yaad kiya gaya tha, or ali ne unhen mohammad ebn abi bakar ke saath badal diya tha
 Mu'awiyah allowed 'amrit ibn al' to conquer Egypt and Amrit successfully did so
 amrit ne pehle romanon se atharah saal pehle misr liya tha lekin uthman ne use barkhaast kar diya tha
 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had no popular support in Egypt and managed to reunite with 2000 men but they dispersed without fighting
 agle varshon main, muvayah kii sena ne iraq ke kai shaharon par kabja kar liya, jo ali ke governor nahin roak sake, or logon ne unke saath ladane ke liye unka samarthan nahin kiya
 Mu'awiyah defeated Egypt, Hijaz, Yemen and other regions
 ali ke khalipha ke aakhri saal main, kupha or basra main manodasha unke paksh main badal gaya kyonki log muvayah ke shasankaal or nitiyon se bhramit ho gaye
 However, people's attitude towards Ali was profoundly different
 unamem se keval ek choti alpsankhyak kaa maananaa tha ki ali mohammad ke baad sabase acha muslim tha or keval un par shashan karne kaa hakdaar tha, jabaki bahumat ne unhen muvayah ke avishvaas or virodh ke kaaran samarthan diya tha
 Ali is said to have sworn in and forewarned an inconsistent campaign against financial corruption and unfair privileges within the caliph's ranks after Uthman was pressed by the public to succeed in the caliphate
 shiyas kaa tark he ki abhijaat varg ke saath apni alokapriyata ke baavjood in sudhaaron ko dhakka dene main unka drudh sankalp amir or paigambar ke visheshadhikaar praapt purv saathi se shatruta kaa kaaran rahaa he
 In a famous letter to his governor Malik Ashtar, he expressed his pro-anti-poor attitude: yaad rakhen ki saamaanya purushon kii naapsand or asweekruti, mahatvapurn vyaktiyon kii sweekruti or kuch bade logon kii naaraazgi se adhik asantulan se adhik logon ko pareshaan nahin kiya jaataa he, yadi aapke vishay ke aam janata or jansampark aapke saath khush hai
 The common man, the poor, clearly the less important sections of your subjects are the pillars of Islam


 more friendly with them and securing their confidence and sympathy
 'ali ne uthman dwaara di gai bhoomi ko waapas laayaa or apane chunaav se pehle praapt hue kuch bhi hasil karne ke liye kasam khai
 Ali opposed the centralization of capital control over provincial revenue, favoring equal distribution of taxes and plunder among Muslim citizens; He distributed the entire revenue of the treasury among them
 'ali ne apane bhai' akel ebn abu talib sahit bhakthivaad se bachanaa
 This was a sign for Muslims of their policy of offering equality to Muslims, who served Islam in its early years and played a role in the subsequent conquest of Muslims
 ali ek vyapak gathbandhan banane main safal rahaa, khaskar oont kii ladaai ke baad 
 His policy of equal distribution of taxes and plunder gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar, who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the Qur'a or Quranic readers who sought pious Islamic leadership
 
 is vividh gathbandhan kaa safal gathan ali ke karishmai charitra ke kaaran hota he
 This diverse coalition is known as Shia Ali, meaning "party" or "ali's faction"
 haalanki, shiya ke saath-saath gaiyr-shiya reporton ke mutabik, 'ali ne apane chunaav ke baad ali ko khalipha ke rup main samarthan dene ke liye samarthan diya, shahi raajnneetik rup se shahi the, dharmik rup se nahin
 Although many people at this time were counted as political Shiites, some of them believed in Ali's religious leadership
