1997 ke baad se iske kuch hi apwaad milte hai
 The reason for the increase in forest land is the conversion of crops and pastures to land
 As urban development is expected to continue, around 93000 km000 of forest land will be destroyed by 20050, a decrease of 3 percent from 1997

 According to a report by Stuart L
 Pimm, the extent of forest cover in the eastern United States reached its lowest point in 1872, about 48 percent of the amount of forest cover in 1620

 One of the main factors in controlling deforestation may come from the Kyoto Protocol

 Newer methods are being used for more high-level farming, such as highly productive hybrid crops, green houses, autonomous construction gardens and hydroponic
 These methods often rely on chemical inputs to maintain the required yields

 Deforestation poses many social and environmental problems
 vaishvik vanonmulan ke taatkaalik or dirghakaalik parinaam prithvi par jivan ko khatre main dal dete hai jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai
 Some of these consequences are: loss of biodiversity, destruction of forest-based societies; and climate disintegration
 For example, the greater loss of the Amazon rain forest can release too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere

 The government claims that at least 1 billion trees have been planted in China since 1982
 ab isaki or zarurat nahin he, lekin china main 12 march ko har saal planting holiday ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 In addition, it marked the beginning of China's Green Wall Project, which aims to halt the expansion of the Gobi Desert by planting trees
 However, the project has not been much successful due to too many trees dying after planting, and the elastic system a better alternative would be to regularly compensate through carbon
 1970 ke baad se china main van kshetra main 47 million hectare kii vruddhi hui he
 The forest cover has increased by about 35 billion trees in 4

 An endoscope may consist of the following components: endoscopy ke antargat shaamil ho sakate hai: The first endoscope was invented in 1806 by Philippe Bozzini with the development of the "lichtliter" introduced by him to examine the tubes and troughs of the human body

 Karl Storge played an important role towards the development of endoscopy, with over 400 patients and functional samples as guides for the coming time

 In the early 1950s Harold Hopkins produced a "fibroscope", which proved useful in both the medical and industry sectors
 in fibron par hone vaale baad ke shodh or vikaas se chitra kii gunvattta main or bhi sudhaar aae
 In the days to come, the use of additional fibers to bring light from a powerful external source to the ends of the object was included in the new development - allowing for a higher level of full spectral brightness, which was needed to see the nuances of the image and color photography
 Is meant for
 optical kshetra main hone vaale vikaas ke saath hi yah kshamta viksit hui, jisamen endoscopist ke haathon main sthit niyantran dwaara tip ko “sanchalit” karnaa sambhav hua or saath hi endoscope ke andar lage shalya-chikitsa upkaran ko remote ke jariye sanchalit karne kii disha main bhi nai suvidhaayen hasil huin

 Eventually enough damage occurs that the entire bundle needs to be replaced
 hopkins ne mahasoos kiya ki kisi agle optical sudhaar ke liye ek alag vidhi kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Earlier strict endoscopes had very low light transmittance and poor image quality
 sargical kaaryon ke liye shalya-chikitsa ke aujaaron or ilumination system ko endoscope tub se hokar gujaarne kii aavashyaktaa ke kaaran imaging optics ke liye koi khaas gunjaaish nahin thi
 The smaller lens of the traditional system required an auxiliary ring, which acquired a larger portion of the lens; These were quite difficult to construct and put together, as well as optically failing
 hopkins ne jo parishkrut nidaan prastut kiya, vah tha ‘little lens’ ke bich ke sthaan ko glass rod se bhar dena
 These fit precisely into the endoscope tube, making them self-concentrating and requiring no support to fully distribute the 'little lens'
 rod-lens ko sanchalit or istemaal karnaa kaaphi aasaan tha or isane adhiktam uplabdh vyas kaa upyog kiya
 The quality of the image was converted into a 1 mm diameter tube with the correct curvature, coating at the ends of the rod and maximum choices of glass type, as assessed and mentioned by Hopkins

 1950 main bharat main samvidhan ke parvartan ke baad, pakistan ke saansadon ne apane samvidhan ko gathit karne ke prayaas tej kar die
 Prime Minister Mohammad Ali and his government officials worked with the support of opposition parties in the country to prepare a constitution for Pakistan
 ant main, is sanyukt kaary ke kaaran, samvidhan ke pehle samoocchy ko lagu kiya gaya
 The incident took place on 23 March 1956, to this day still celebrates Republic Day on the occasion of the enforcement of the Constitution of Pakistan
 is samvidhan ne pakistan ko "ekasadaneey vidhayika" ke saath sarkaar kii sansadeey pranali pradaan kii
 Also, it officially declared Pakistan an Islamic republic
 iske alaava, isamen, samta ke siddhant ko bhi pehali baar pesh kiya gaya tha
 By constitution, Iskandar Mirza assumed the office of president, but due to his continued unconstitutional involvement in national affairs, the four elected Prime Ministers were dismissed in just two years
 janata ke dabaav ke tahat, raashtrapati iskundar mirza ne 1958 main takhtapalat ko vaid tehraaya; or is prakaar yah samvidhan lagbhag nilambit ho gaya
 Shortly afterwards General Ayub Khan deposed Iskandar Mirza and declared himself President
 or isliye is yah samvidhan keval 3 saal ke liye hi chal paaya
 On 17 February 1960, Ayub Khan appointed a commission to report on the future political structure of the country

 The report of this Constitution Commission was presented to President Ayub on 6 May 1961 and after an investigation by the President and his Cabinet, in January 1962, the Cabinet finally approved the original text of the new Constitution
 ise raashtrapati ayub dwaara 1 march 1962 ko lagu kiya gaya tha or ant main 8 june 1962 ko yah prabhaav main aayaa
 This constitution contained 250 articles divided into twelve parts and three programs

 But according to the projects of this constitution, as compared to the constitution of 1956, the President of Pakistan was given many rights, and basically a presidential system was formed
 1956 ke samvidhan kii tarah hi 1962 kaa samvidhan bhi adhik samay tak nahin rah paaya
 The second martial law in Pakistan was imposed on 26 March 1969 when President Ayub Khan abolished the constitution in 1962 and handed over power to the commander-in-chief of the army, General Aga Mohammad Yahya Khan

 The truth of society and life has descended in his satirical compositions - when the pebble in the court made a terra, put a rupee here, it is mine

 abhikalp yaa dizin shabd kaa upyog prayukt kalaon, abhiyantriki, vaastushilp evam isi tarah ke anya srujanaatmak kaaryon evam kshetron main kiya jaataa he
 It is used as a verb and as a noun
 kriya ke rup main dizin kaa arth us prakriya se he jo kisi utpaada, dhaancha, tantra yaa saamaan ko astitv main laane yaa uske vikaas ke liye apanaayi jaati he
 The word design as a noun is used in two meanings - aajkal prakriyaayonko bhi dizin kaa parinaam mana jaataa he
 Process design is used in this sense
 dizin ke antargat bahut se lakshya nirdhaarit kiye gayi hote hai
 Among these, the main requirements are - work related, size and volume, price or cost related, power requirement, maintenance and improvement related to deterioration, ease of interconnecting different parts, ease of manufacture and production etc
 abhiklpana kisi purvanishchit dhyey kii uplabdhi ke liye tatsambandhi vichaaron evam anya sabhi sahaayak vastuon ko krambaddh rup se suvyavasthit kar dena hi 'abhiklpana' he
 Architects plan the construction of a building by marking the lines in various forms, thinking of the accomplishment of a single goal
 kalakaar bhi rekhaon ke sangyojan se chitra main ek vishesh prabhaav yaa vichaar upasthit karne kaa praytn karata he
 Similarly, the building engineer assigns various measurements to a building to ensure its durability and firmness
 sabhi baaten abhiklpana ke antargat hai
 It is the duty of the architect to present a viable design that is convenient and economical in the goal of building construction
 saath hi use yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki imaarat kaa aakaar us kshetra ke pados ke anukool ho or apane id-gird khadi puraani imaaraton ke saath bhi uskaa mail baith sake
 Suppose all the houses around Eid are arched doorways, then a flat stop between them will not suit the flat-faced house
 isi tarah or bhi kai baaten hai jinka vichaar parshvavarti vaataavaran ko drushti main rakhte hue kiya janaa chahie
 The second special thing that is considered for the architect is the decision of a stable opinion about the exterior shape of the building
 vah aisa hona chahie ki ek raah chalata vyakti bhi bhawan ko dekhakar puche bina yah samaj le ki vah bhawan kisalie bana he
 For example, a college should not look like a hospital, nor should the shape of a hospital be like a college
 banks kaa bhawan dekhne main pusht or surakshit laganaa chahie or naatakghar yaa cinemaghar kaa bahari drishy shobhaneey hona chahie
 The architect should be sure that he has made full use of the entire area on which he has to build the building
 kalapurna abhiklpanaaon ke antargat manoranjan athwa rangamanch ke liye parde rangnaa, alankaran ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke chitrankan, kisi vishesh vichaar ko abhivyakt karne ke liye bhittichitra bananaa aadi kaary bhi aate hai
 The quality of the artist is to give real shape to his design
 chitra ko kalakaar ke vichaaron kii sajiv abhivyakti kaa pratik hona chahie
 According to the requirement of the painting, the artist made pencil sketches, oil paintings, watercolor paintings etc
 imaaraton ke ejeeniyar ko vaastuvid kii abhiklpana ke anusaar hi apni abhiklpana aisi banani hoti he ki imaarat apane par padanevaale sab bhaaron ko sanbhaalane ke liye yathesht pusht ho
 With this in view, he selects the specific equipment for construction and orders the installation of such construction material so as to make the building affordable and durable
 iske liye is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he ki nirmaan ke liye sujhaaye gaye vishisht padaarth bazaar main uplabdh hai yaa nahin, athwa sujhai gai vishisht kaaryastylee ko karyanvit karne ke liye abhisht dakshata kaa abhaav to nahin he
 In estimating the weight, the weight of the building itself, its moving load when it is being built or used, the impact of shock of moving loads, wind pressure, the result of earthquake bumps, heating, shrinkage, foundation seating etc
 Have to keep in mind
 inamen se kuch bhaaron kii gananaa to sookshmata se kii jaae sakati he, kintu kai aise bhi hai jinhen vigat anubhavon ke aadhaar par keval anumaanit kiya ja saktaa he
 Take the force of an earthquake --- it is very difficult to estimate and there can be no preconception of how much force and where the earthquake will occur
 tathaapi saubhagyavash adhiktar chal or achal bhaaron ke prabhaav kii gananaa bahut kuch thik-thik kii ja sakati he
 Adequate correct estimation of heat and shrinkage pressure can also be done by studying the interference in the heat of the entire cycle cycle and the known properties of concrete
 hawa evam bukamp ke kaaran padanevaale bal antatogatva anishchit hi hote hai, parantu unki maatra ke anumaan main thodi truti rahane se praaia: haani nahin hoti
 The construction material is generally confirmed so that even if there is a 33 percent increase in the forces of pressure, there is no possibility of any loss
 neenv ke dhansane kaa acha anumaan neeche kii bhoomi kii upyukt jaanch se ho jaataa he
 Each designer also has to take into account some unknown facts, such as the inability of the craftsmen, the burden of unthinkable crowds of people at some time, the hidden potential weaknesses of the substances used, etc
 in tathyon ko 'surakshagunak' ke antargat rakhaa jaataa he, jo ispaat ke liye 2 se 1 / 2 or kancreet, shateer tathaa anya upkarnon ke liye 3 se 4 tak mana jaataa he
 The safety factor should not be used as an excuse to carry additional load on the building
 yah keval agyaat kaarnon ke liye he or ek seemaa tak hraas ke liye bhi, jo bhavishya main bhawan ko dhakke, jarjarata evam mausam kii anischitataayen sahan karne ke liye sahaayak siddh ho saktaa he

 Mandan Mishra was a well-known teacher of former epistemology
 kumaril bhatta ke baad inhen ko pramaan mana jaataa he
 His faith is respected in Advaita Vedanta philosophy too
 ye bhartruhari ke baad kumaril ke antim samay main tathaa aadi shankaracharya ke samakaleen the
 He wrote original texts on both the philosophy of Mimamsa and Vedanta
 mimasaanukramanika, bhaavnavivek or vidhivivek - ye teen granth mimasaa par; shabd darshan par sphotsiddhi, pramanashastra par vivek tathaa advait vedant par brahmasiddhi - ye inke granth hai
 Shaliknath and Jayant Bhatt mentioned Mandana while refuting Vedanta
 shankar bhashya ke suprasiddh vyaakhyaata, bhaamati ke nirmaataa vachaspati mishra ne mandan kii brahmasiddhi ko dhyaan main rakhkar apni kriti likhi
 Mandalash Mishra and Shankaracharya's place of learning, Mandleshwar is a holy city situated on the Narmada River
 The Chhappan Dev Temple, the site of the scripture is ancient and the famous entrance site of Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya is a great place to visit Gupteshwar Mahadev Temple
 Due to which Mandleshwar is very famous
 ek parampara ke anusaar mandan kumaril bhatta ke shishy the
 This was later defeated by Sankaracharya in scripture and became a monk and was named Suresvaracharya
 mandan or sureshwar ek hi hai yaa alag-alag - isko lekar bada vivaad hua he
 Most of the evidence is in favor of the difference between the two
 mandan ne shabdadvait kaa samarthan kiya he, par sureshwar iske bare main maun hai
 Mandan to a great extent endorsed the otherwise radicalism in Advaitprasthana, but Sureshwar refutes it
 mandanke anusaar jeev avidya kaa aashray he, sureshwar brahm ko hi avidya kaa aashray or vish maanate hai
 On the basis of this difference, two departures of Advaita Vedanta started
 bhaamati prasthaan mandan kaa anuyaayi bana, vivaran prasthaan sureshwar ke siddhanton par chalaa
 Sureshwar considers pure knowledge as the path of salvation, but according to Mandana, salvation is not attained by listening to Vedanta, unless Agnihotra etc
 is a cooperative knowledge of Karma, and in some ancient authentic texts, Mandana and Sureshwar are not considered one
 mandan mishra kumaril bhatta ke shishy the, is baat kaa koi akatya pramaan nahin miltaa
 This is said only on the basis of 'shankar-digvijay', which is an extremely apocalyptic story-book
 mandan or sureshwar kii bhinnata ke hi jab adhikansh pramaan milte hai to yah kaha janaa kisi bhi tarah se uchit nahin he ki mandan hi shastrarth main parajeet hokar sureshwar bane the
 The fact that there is a debate between these two great men is purely imaginary and strategic, promoted in the medieval period by Shankar's monastery
 shabdadvait, anyathaakhyatvaad, avidya, jeev, brahm aadi ke bare main sureshwar ke jo bhi vichaar hai, ve shat-pratishat shankaracharya ke anugami hai
 Love of the Guru's feet is his ultimate goal
 ve ashishnutaa kii had tak mandan kaa virodh karte hai or unhen alag prasthaan kaa advaithavedanti bataate hai
 Then, how can the same Sureshwar himself be a Mandan? The originator of 'description-departure' is not 'description-car', while 'bhamati-departure' follows full mandana
 jab kisi bhi pracheen granth main mandan or sureshwar ko ek nahi mana gaya he, tab hamaare vidwaan-gana kyon shastrarth ke myth kaa boj sar par uthaae yug-yug se pareshaan ho rahe hai
 Even now the truth has to be accepted
