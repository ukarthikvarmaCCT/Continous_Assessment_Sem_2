 Some traits aid the survival of individuals and some hinder it
 parivesh ke zyada anukulit shaks apane kam anukulit pratidwandviyon kii tulana main agali peedi ko zyada santaanen dete hai
 Characteristics that hinder survival and reproduction disappear after a few generations
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main sahaayta karte hai wo peedi dar peedi jamaa hote rahete hai
 In this way, due to the unequal ability of the person's survival and reproduction, the population changes gradually
 praaniyon or padpon main bhinnataaon ke avlokan prakritik varan ke siddhant kii buniyaad bane
 Darwin observed that orchids and insects have a special partnership that helps in pollination of plants
 unhone dekha ki orchidon main aisi bahut sari sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo kiton ko aakarshith karti hai, taaki pushpon kaa paraag unke sharir main chipak jaae
 In this way the kits carry pollen from a male orchid to a female orchid
 orchidon kii jatil dikhaawat ke baavjood, ye visheshikrut bhaag unheen moolbhoot sanrachanaon se banate hai jinase anya pushp banate hai
 In his book Fertilization of Orchids, Darwin proposes that orchid flowers are more adapted to the environment by the process of natural selection from the existing floral parts
 darwin abhi apane vichaaron par anusandhan or prayog kar hi the ki unhen alfred rasal vailes se ek chitthee mili
 In this letter, Wallace described a theory similar to Darwin's theory
 iske kaaran donon ne in siddhanton kaa sanyukt prakaashan kiya
 Wallace and Darwin both looked at the history of life as a family tree, with the tip of the branch representing today's castes and a common ancestor rather than the branching of the branches
 darwin ne kaha ki jivit chizein rishtedaar hai
 This meant that the whole life originated from a few simple ancestors
 or yah bhi sambhaavna thi ki sabhi jeevon kaa ek hi purvaj ho
 Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 in his book The Emergence of Animals
 unke siddhant kaa matlab he ki maanav samet sabhi jeev aviraam prakritik prakriyaaon kii upaj hai
 Due to this some religious groups have raised objection to the theory of evolution
 iske vipareet vaigyanik samudaay main 99 pratishat se zyada log is siddhant kaa samarthan karte hai
 Natural selection is often synonymous with survival of the fittest, but this expression originates from Herbert Spencer's book Biology Theory, published in 1864, five years after Darwin's book
 swasthitam kii uttarjivita prakritik varan kii prakriya ko galat dhang se samajhaati he kyonki prakritik varan keval uttarjivan ke bare main nahin he or hameshaa swasthitam hi nahin jivit rahata he
 Darwin's theory of natural selection laid the foundation for the modern theory of evolution
 unke anusandhanon or avlokanon ne dikhaaya ki ek aabaadi ke shaks ek duusare se bhinn hote hai, in bhinnataaon main se kuch bhinnataayen mata-pita se milti hai or prakritik varan in bhinnataaon ko chunata or tyaagta he
 But they could not give a reason for these differences
 apane se pehle ke jeev vaigyanikon kii tarah ve samajhate rahe ki anuvaanshik lakshan upyog yaa anupyog kaa kaaran the, or apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan apane bacchon ko die ja sakate hai
 He tried to find examples of this
 unhone sochaa ki shuturamurg jaise bade udaan rahit pakshiyon kii taangen zyada chalane ke kaaran peedi dar padhi shaktishaalee hoti rahi hongi, or unke pankh kam udne ke kaaran peedi dar peedi kamazor hote rahe honge
 This misconception was called the "heredity of acquired traits", which was part of the theory "change of castes" proposed by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1809
 19 veen shatabdi ke ant main yah siddhant ko lamarkwaad kehalaata tha
 Darwin proposed an unsuccessful theory called pangenesis to explain the heredity of traits acquired over a lifetime
 1880 ke dashak main august visman ke prayogon ne dikhaaya ki apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan bacchon ko nahin die ja sakate hai
 Due to this, Lamarckism was abandoned in some time
 nae lakshan mata-pita dwaara santanon ko kaise die jate hai, iskaa uttar anuvanshiki par grager mendal ke agrani kaary se mila
 His experiments conducted over several generations of pea plants proved that genetic information is split at the time of formation of sex cells in the mother and father and that information from the mother and father is added at random during fertilization
 isaki tulana taash ke patton se kii ja sakati he jahaan kisi jeev ko aadhe pattey mata se yadrichhik dhang se milte hai or baaki aadhe pita se yadrichhik dhang se
 Mendel called this information factors, but later the name Jean became more prevalent
 jin anuvanshiki kii mul ikai he
 They contain information that directs the physical development and behavior of the organism
 jin diene se banate hai
 DNA is a long molecule made up of small molecules called nucleotides
 anuvaanshik jaankaree diene main newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa ke rup main sangrahit hoti he
 DNA can be compared to an article in which nucleotides act as characters
 jis prakaar varnon kii shrunkhlaa se ek bana lekh jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he, usee prakaar newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa se bana diene anuvaanshik jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he
 Genes are instructions made from the letters of the alphabet of DNA
 sabhi jin milakar ek "nirdesh pustika" ke jaise hote hai jisamen ek jeev ko banane or kaam karaane kii sari jaankaree hoti he
 Changing these instructions written in DNA due to mutation increases the genetic variation of the population
 diene keshikaon ke andar chromosomon main hota he
 a random mixture of chromosomes from parents at fertilization gives the offspring a unique combination of genes
 langik janan ke dauraan jeenon kaa yah yadrichhik mishran bhi aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 Genetic variation of a population also increases with breeding with another population
 is kaaran aabaadi main wo jin aa sakate hai jo usamen pehle se maujuud nahin the
 Sequence is not a random process
 haalanki diene main utparivartan yadrichhik dhang se hota he, par prakritik varan yadrichhik prakriya nahin he, uttarjivan or prajnan kii sambhaavna parivesh par nirbhar karti he
 The evolution is the result of natural selection over billions of years of flawed copying
 kram-vikaas kaa parinaam bakubi rachaa gaya jeev nahin hota he
 The result of natural selection is adapted organisms of their existing environment
 kram-vikaas kisi param lakshya kii taraf pragati nahin he
 Evolution does not attempt to create more developed, more intelligent or more complex organisms
 udhaaharan ke liye, pissu bichchhu makkhi kehalaae jane vaale ek pankhons vaale jeev ke vanshaj hai, or ajagaron main abhi bhi nanhee sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo unke purvajon ke pichley pairon ke avshesh hai
 Rapid changes in the environment usually lead to extinction of the maximum castes
 prithvi par rahi 99 pratishat se adhik jatiyaan vilupt ho chuki hai
 Five major mass extinctions have occurred since the beginning of life on Earth
 inke kaaran jatiyon kii vividhta main badi or aakasmik giravat hui he
 The most recent of these is the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event, which took place 6
6 million years ago
 genetic drift ek jati kii aabaadiyon main eleelon kii aavruti ke badalane ko kehete hai
 a allele is a variation of a gene
 ye baalo kaa rang, twachaa kaa rang, ankhon kaa rang, rakt prakaar aadi nirdhaarit karte hai
 Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles into the population, but it can reduce genetic diversity by removing any alleles from the population
 genetic drift eleelon ke yadrichhik chayan se hoti he
 Selection is truly random when no external force influences it
 udhaaharan ke liye, samaan maap or bhaar par bhinn rangon ke kanchon se bhare ek apaardarshee thile se kuch kanche nikaalnaa ek yadrichhik chayan he
 Whether or not a person will be able to give their alleles to their children depends on their survival in which coincidence also plays a role
 sanyog ke kaaran aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti ke badalane kii is prakriya ko genetic drift kehete hai
 Genetic drift has a greater impact on small populations than on larger populations
 hardi-venberg niyam kahata he ki hardi-venberg samyavastha main hone vaali ek badi aabaadi main pidiyon ke saath eleelon kii aavruti nahin badalegi
 But it is impossible for a population of sufficient size to reach this system because these five things are necessary to reach this system
 1) aabaadi kaa aakaar anant hona chahie
 2) The mutation rate should be zero percent, because mutation can change alleles or create new alleles
 3) aabaadi se yaa main pravrajan nahin hona chahie, kyonki aabaadi main aane vaale yaa aabaadi ko chhodane vaale shaks eleelon kii aavruti ko badal sakate hai
 4) There should be no selective pressure on the population, that is, the probability of survival or reproduction of a person should not be more than others
 5) samagam puri tarah se yadrichhik hona chahie, jahaan sabhi nar baraabar aakarshak saathi hon
 This ensures truly random adulteration of alleles
 hardi-venberg samyavastha main aabaadi taash ke patton ke ek deck ke anuroop he; deck ko chaahe jitani baar phenta jaae, usamen na koi nayaa patta aayega or na koi patta nikalegaa
 The alleles in the population here have been compared to deck leaves
 aabaadi bottlenake paryaavaran kii ghatnaon ke kaaran kisi jati kii aabaadi ke teji se kam ho jane ko kehete hai
 a truly random population bottlenac does not favor any allele; That is, it is random which person will survive
 ek bottlenake aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko kam yaa khatm kar saktaa he
 The subsequent genetic drift may further reduce the genetic diversity of the population
 genetic vividhta kii kami aabaadi ko anya chaynaatmak dabaavon ke jokhim main daal sakati he
 An example of a population bottleneck is the "northern Elephant Seaway"
 19 veen ke atyaadhik shikaar ke kaaran uttari eliphant jalavyaghron kii aabaadi tees shakson se kam ho gai thi
 Due to conservation, the population of these has crossed one lakh and is increasing continuously
 par aabaadi bottlenake ke prabhaav saafe dikhaai dete hai
 In the absence of genetic diversity in the population, these aquifers are at great risk from diseases and are very likely to have genetic disorders
 sansthaapak kaa prabhaav tab hota he jab aabaadi kii ek choti toli baaki aabaadi se alag hokar ek nai aabaadi ban jaati he
 Often this is due to geographical isolation
 is nai aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti aksar puraani aabaadi se alag hoti he
 The genetic designs of the next generations will depend on the genetic designs of the founders, which will be different from the older population
 sansthaapak ke prabhaav kaa ek udhaaharan amish logon ke 1744 ke pencilvenia deshaantaran se miltaa he
 The two founders of the Amishite colony of Pennsylvania had recessive alleles of the Ellis – van Kreveld syndrome
 amish logon kii apane samudaay ke baahar shaadi na karne kii pratha ke kai pidiyon tak chalane ke kaaran un main elice–vine creveld sanglakshan kii aavruti baaki aabaadi se kaafii zyada he

 badhir balak do prakaar ke hote hai
 Those who are extremely deaf can be placed in the first category
 inamen tanik bhi shravanshakti nahin hoti isliye shabdon ko na sunne ke kaaran ve uccharan bhi nahin kar pate kyonki bhashaa kaa siikhnaa anukaran par adhik nirbhar hota he
 The second type of deaf are those whose hearing power is so weak that they cannot hear ordinary conversations but can listen with the help of hearing aids
 arjeet badhirta ke kuch saamaanya kaaran hote hai
 To understand this, it is necessary to know about the design of the ears
 Normally there are three parts of the ears: 1
 external ear 2
 middle ear and 3
 internal ear
 bahyakarna ke kaaran keval ek pratishat badhir hote hai jo khaaj, phode funsi yaa jalane ke kaaran keval prabhavit hota he
 The main causes of deafness resulting from malfunction of the ear are ear loss, scarlet fever, smallpox, pneumonia etc
 madhyakarna ke kaaran 45 pratishat badhirta hoti he
 Apart from all this, deafness also occurs due to malfunction of the ear nerves
 in snayutantuon kaa haani pahunchaanevaale kaaran gardantod bukhaar, miyadi fever hote hai
 Sometimes, deafness also occurs due to injury

 Sri Tallapaka Annamacharya or directly Annamacharya was a Telugu saint poet and author of Carnatic music
 ve dakshin bharat ke pehle sangitajna the jinhone sankirthan kii rachana kii
 He composed many hymns in praise of Lord Venkateswara, the deity of the Tirumala Seven Mountains
 telegu bhashaa bhashi unako pad-kavita kaa pitamah maanate hai
 
 Most of the hymns of Annamacharya are full of spirituality
 annamacharya kaa janm baishakh shuddh poornima ko bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke kadappa jile ke ek gaanv main hua
 In praise of Lord Venkateswara, Annamacharya composed 32,000 hymns
 , lekin inamen mahaj 13000 rachanaaen hi is samay uplabdh hai
 His hymns are of two types — spiritual and adorned, though most compositions are adorned
 unki aadhyatmik rachanaaen vaishnav darshan par aadhaarit he
 Annamacharya belonged to the Ramanujacharya sect
 unhone ahobila math main shri satagopa yatindra se diksha grahan kii
 
 He dwells on the subjects of morality, Dharma, righteousness, etc
 in his spiritual songs
 His erotic songs worship Lord Venkateswara by describing his amorous and romantic adventures, a tradition now known as Madhura Bhakti
 Most of these songs describe the adventures of Venkateswara and Alamel Manga, while others describe the Bhakti of Krishna's devotees
 He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era, with his sankeertanas explaining that the relationship between God and human is the same irrespective of the latters' color, caste and financial status, in beautiful yet powerful usage of words in his song "brahmam Okkate Parabrahmam Okkate 


" His choice of words gives a mellifluous tone to his songs, charming the listener
 His prodigious literary career that produced about 32,000 songs, many of which were greatly acclaimed, has earned him a place among the all-time greats of telugu literature
 His meeting with Purandara Dasa in Tirumala
 Once when Purandara Dasa visited Tirumala he heard a great old man singing his composition in front of the Almighty Srinivasa
 He at once approached the old man and said that the song was composed for practicing music
 At the same time, Sri Sri Vyasaraya of the Vyasaraya mutt intervened and introduced the great old man as Talapaka Anammacharya to Purandara Dasa
 This is one of the major event in the history of music where two great souls met each other and paid due respect to each other
 Purandara Dasa is revered as the Father of Carnatic Music who formulated the music as it is today
 The composition Sri Annamacharya sang is like Padumanabha Paramapurusha An ardent devotee of Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati, AP, Annamacharya successfully composed more than 32,000 sankeertanas in the Carnatic music tradition
 Though a great feat in itself, it still falls short of the estimated 475,000 sankeertanas composed by Purandara Dasa
 While enjoying popularity in his own days, his compositions were forgotten for over three centuries for some inexplicable reason
 They were later found engraved on copper plates, hidden for centuries inside the Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala
 Annamacharya considered his compositions as floral offerings to God
 In the poems, he praises Venkateswara, describes his love for him, argues and quarrels with the Lord, confesses the devotee's failures and apprehensions, and surrenders himself to Venkateshwara
 His songs are classified into the Adhyaatma and Sringaara sankeertanas genres
 Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has been successfully endeavouring to preserve the rich heritage of his compositions
 The sustained efforts of dedicated scholars and musicians during the last thirty years have also helped revive their popularity among the Telugu people
 The sankeertanas engraved on copper plates were found in the Tirumala temple just opposite the Hundi, concealed in a very small room
 It is said only 12,000 of the 32,000 sankeertanas were found
 No leads have been available to trace the remaining sankeertanas
 Some personnel involved in deciphering the plates say that the people of those days could have melted the copper plates for personal use
 The telugu film "annamaya" was based on his story
 It was released on 13th May 1997

his sankirtanas are very popular amongst Carnatic singers and connoisseurs, especially in the state of Andhra Pradesh
 The programme, lakshagala Sankirthanarchana, some 160,000 people sang seven Annamayya keertanas in Hyderabad, creating a new Guinness record on May 10, 2009

 salauddin ne gheraa daalanevaalon ko ghere main daal diya
 When the army of France arrived in April of 1191 and the army of England in June, Salauddin withdrew his army, leaving only the part of the sea in which the monkeys were located from the kingdom of Jerusalem

 After the period of the ceasefire, the German Emperor Henry Sixt invaded again and two armies also came by sea to help him
 par safalataa na mili
 The pioneer of this war was Pope Innocent III
 uski prabal ichha isai mat ke donon sampradaayon ko milaane kii thi jiske liye vah purvi samrat ko bhi apane adheen karnaa chahta tha
 The power of the Pope was at its peak at this time
 vah jis rajya ko jise chahta, de detaa tha
 His policy was also sympathetic and supportive of the Venetian and Norman castes, the most powerful states in the navy and commerce at that time
 pope kaa uddeshy is prakaar isai jagat main ekta utpann karke musalamaanon ko pavitra bhoomi se nikaal dena tha
 But the goal of his assistants was political and economic

 Apart from taking money, gems and artifacts from the treasury, the famous church Saint Safiya also looted, in whose roof, it is said, an emperor had put 18 tons of gold

 Four years after this, he attempted to rescue Acker, but was not successful
 jab 1268 main turko ne isaayiyon se antiaki le liya, tab lui nav ne ek or krush yuddh kiya
 He hoped that the King of Tuans would become a Christian in North Africa

 in dharmayudhon ke itihaas main is baat kaa jwalanth pramaan miltaa he ki dharmik andhvishwaas or kattarta ko uttejit karne se munashya main swayan vichaar karne kii shakti nahin rah jaati
 This shows how much persecution and massacre can also be carried out by the propaganda of bigotry, such as the followers of a peaceful faith like Christianity
 jo dharmasainik yatriyon kii chikitsa ke liye athwa mandir kii raksha ke liye dikshit hue, ve yahan ke vaataavaran main sansari ho gaye
 They started to do mahajani

 gwaal, gangolihot tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke pithoragarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Migration of birds or migration of birds is a very important part of ornithology
 unka yah pravrajan, rituparivartan ke samaan niyamit or kramik hota he or yug-yug se yah manushyon main utsukata or jigyaasa utpann karata rahaa he, yahan tak ki red indianon ne apane kalendar ke maheenon ke naam pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon ke aagaman par hi rakhaa he
 Landborough Tomson, a recognized scholar of the subject of bird migration, has described the migration as follows: bahut purv aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jis prakaar kuch stanpayi or urag sharad ritu main thand se bachane ke liye sheetanishkriyata main chale jate hai, usee bhanti ababil, kalvinkak or koyal bhi shitashayan karti hai
 Such a belief had been prevalent since Aristotle's time
 ushnraktata, pankh or udaan kii adbhut shakti ke kaaran chidiyon main sthanparivartan karne kii kshamta kaa vikaas bahut adhik hua he
 Although birds are more tolerant of both extreme cold or extreme heat than other animals, they are forced to migrate when there is a lack of food in the autumn, otherwise they may die
 pravrajan ke dwaara chidiyon ko do pratikul rituon main bhi do anukool kshetra praapt ho jate hai
 In one region they live and breed and in another region go for food and rest
 yah prakruti kaa vidhaan he ki chidiya pravrajan kshetra ke thande bhaag main hi andey detii hai
 Hence their mating area in the Northern Hemisphere is the Arctic North Pole or temperate zone, but in contrast to the Southern Hemisphere, winter habitat is near the equator
 praaia: pravrajan uttar se dakshin kii ore hota he, yadhyapi kuch pravrajan purv se pashchim kii ore bhi hota he
 Migration ranges from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers, as some birds descend from the higher elevations of the Himalayas to the plains of northern India and some thousands of kilometers to the south
 sabase adhik dur kaa pravrajan uttar dhruviya kurri karti he
 This migration occurs twice every year
 yah arctic ke sheetkaal main dakshin kii ore deshaagaman karti he, sansar ko paar kar dakshin dhruv antarctic main greeshm ritu bitaakar pun: waapas hoti he
 In this way, the journey of one way to and from the journey covers a distance of about 17,742 km
 chidiyon main pravrajan kaa aarambh hone ke sambandh main anek siddhant pratipadit hai
 Sparrows have the following benefits from migration: chidiyon kaa pravrajan pakshi kii ant: or bahya donon hi uttejnaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Experiments reveal that the change in the time period of the external stimuli is prominent; The internal stimulation is produced by hormones produced by the genitals
 pravrajan kaa lakshyasthaan kaise nirdhaarit hota he or chidiyaan is gantavy sthaan kaa rasta kaise maaloom karti hai, inkaa anek prayogon or prekshanon se par bhi abhi tak santoshjanak uttar nahin mil sakaa he
 In the spring, after the autumn, the first return of adult males occurs in the breeding area or summer-dwelling area
 iske baad vayask maadaaen or ant main avyask chidiyaan pahunchati hai
 But in the autumn this sequence is reversed
 pratham avyask pakshi or maadaaen dakshini yatra ke liye prasthaan karti hai or baad main vayask nar
 The journey to the south takes a lot of leisure and stops from place to place
 chote bachche athwa kishor, jinaki umr kuch hi maheenon kii hoti he, kafile kaa pathpradarshan karte hai or vayask baad main unka anusaran karte hai
 How does this happen? There have been many interpretations of this
 unamem se adhik sweekrut mat yah he ki anek pidiyon ke prati varsh pravrajan ke kaaran pakshiyon main anya janmajaat gunon, jaise thik samay par, bina kisi purv anubhav ke, jatiparampara ke anusaar ek vishesh prakaar kaa need nirmaan karnaa he, usee bhanti bina kisi purv anubhav ke pravrajan bhi ek janmajaat gun ho gaya he
 How do birds find the way to remote territories? There are many hypotheses about this, some of which are subtle sensitivity to the magnetism of the Earth, identification by sight of landmarks etc
 kintu purvanubhavvihin kal kii chidiyon main dur gantavy sthaan or uske path ko nirdhaaran ab bhi rahasyamay bana hua he
 Just as a man travels to the faraway and then returns to his home, just as the birds travel thousands of kilometers and spend the autumn in a remote place, not only reach their summer-residence area, but also They also reach the nest
 chidiyon ko challa pehanaane kii vidhi se yah sthapit ho gaya he ki europe main ababil praaia: na keval usee basti main pahunch jaati he, balki usee ghar main jisko chhodkar vah sudur kii yatra par gai thi, pahunch jaati he
 The abbeel covers a distance of 9,677 kilometers in this journey
 yaheen baat anya vaastavik pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon main bhi pai jaati he
 Some known facts published as a result of many years of inspection reveal that the birds not only reach their habitat and old nid, but also return on the exact day they returned in the previous year
 atev jab itani lambii yatra karti hon to ek nishchit samay par lautakar pakshiyon kaa apane ghonsle main upasthit ho janaa or bhi ascharyajanak he
 The position of each autumn bird in the winter in different regions of India varies
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi bhi sthaan ko le len, jaise madhya bharat kaa bhopal kshetra
 Most species of birds, which travel from north or northwest frontier regions in the autumn, to the far south or to Lanka, through that country, go through Bhopal
 in yatriyon main se kuch to peeche rah jate hai or ve sharad ritu bhar bhopal main dekhen ja sakate hai
 We can classify these under the actual autumn, but some remain only for a short time upon the arrival of autumn and do not appear thereafter as they have departed from there to travel further
 ve pun: greeshm ritu ke prarambh main, jab ve uttar kii taraf lautate hote hai, dikhaai padate hai
 They are migrating travelers in autumn and spring
 kuch to sharad ritu main, jab dakshin kii yatra par hote hai, tab to dikhaai padate hai, kintu jab ve vasant main pun: apane nivas kii ore lautate hote hai, tab dikhaai nahin padate, kyonki ve kisi duusare maarg se hokar laut jate hai
 Hence those birds appear in Bhopal in autumn and in spring in some other part
 kuch chidiyaan desh ke andar hi ek bhaag se duusare bhaag main sthanparivartan karti hai, jaise shah bulbul yaa dudhnju, sunaharaa polak or naurang 
 This local migration occurs more in the northern part of the country or in the foothills of the mountains, where seasonal changes are more effective than in the equator
 vaastavik pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon kii bhanti inamen bhi pravrajan kramik or niyamit hota he
 In some parts of the country, some caste arrive in summer, some caste in rain and some caste in autumn
 iske atirikt ek anya prakaar kaa bhi sthanparivartan baraabar hota rahata he, jo aahaar par prabhaav daalanevaali sthaneey paristhitiyon, jaise garmi, sookhaa yaa baadh ityadi, athwa kisi vishesh prakaar ke phool lagane or fal pakane kii ritu, ke kaaran hota he
 At that time sparrows move from one area to another
 kabhi-kabhi asaadhaaran paristhitiyon se baadhya hokar apane upyukt nivasasthaan kii chhodkar bhojan kii talash main chidiyaan kisi anya kshetron main bhi bhraman karti hui pai jaati hai
 Therefore, the population of birds is not constant in any area at any given time, because the arrival and regularization of birds in all the areas is always happening
 himalay ke unche pahaado main rahanevaali chidiyaan jaade main neeche utar aati he or is prakaar tufaani mausam or himrekha se neeche chali aati he
 On the arrival of spring, when the ice begins to thaw and the ice line rises upward, they climb again into the upper reaches of the mountains to lay eggs
 yah kram keval oonchaai main rahanevaale pakshiyon main hi nahin varan neeche rahanevaali chidiyon main bhi chalata rahata he
 In addition to gaining scientific knowledge of sparrows migration, light and inscribed rings of aluminum are worn in the majority of sparrows' feet in Britain and the United States
 yah vidhi america main pakshivalayan athwa pakshipatbandhan kehalaati he
 In addition to the serial number, the address of the place is also mentioned
 chidiyon ko anguthi pahanaakar unka purna vivaran ek pustika main likh kar unhen chhod diya jaataa he
 Now on reaching remote places of these sparrows, their ring is taken off by hitting or trapping them and they are sent to the address from where they flew
 jab kaaphi sankhya main is prakaar kii talika ikatthi ho jaati he tab in talikaon kaa vishleshan karke uske aadhaar par kisi vishesh jati kii chidiya ke pravrajan ke maarg athwa anya kisi samasya kaa hal nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, it has been established with certainty and doubtless as a result of the white buck's burrowing in West Germany and the eastern region that the birds of East Asia travel through the southeastern route to Africa, while the white buck of West Germany The South Western route leads to Africa via Spain
 bikaner main isi prakaar kii anguthidhari chidiyon ke praapt hone se hamen pataa chalaa he ki kuch shwet bak jo hamaare desh main, sharad ritu main, aate hai, ve germany ke hote hai
 In India, this type of advocacy has done very little
 kintu jitna kuch hua he usase praapt suchnaayen bahut hi mahatvapurn or upyogi siddh hui hai
 The speed of migrating birds is different in different birds and this speed depends on many things like wind direction, weather etc
 batakhon or hanson main udaan kii gati 64 se 80 kilometre prati ghante pai gai he or anukool mausam main yah gati 90 se 97 kilometre yaa isse adhik pai gai he
 This speed is 9
5 to 17
7 kilometers per hour in birds flying continuously during the day and night
 nimnlikhit sarini se yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki ek baar kii udaan main koun chidiya kitni duuri tay karti he : The Eastern Golden Titibh flies continuously without stopping anywhere and crosses the open sea of 3226
00 km
 yah tittibh sharad ritu main, bharat main bhraman karne aate hai
 It lays eggs in western Alaska and northeastern Sibiria and regularly tours the Hawaiian Islands
 chaha jisaki maadaa keval japan main andey detii he, jaada purvi austrailia or tezmania main vyateet karata he, is prakaar avashya hi 4839
00 kilometre kii duuri bina kahi ruke nirantar udakar paar kar jaataa he
 There are other such birds, which go a long distance without any grain of water
 adhik dur kii yatra karanevaali bhartiya chidiyon main sambhavat: main bhandu teetar he jiskaa andey dene kaa sabase nikatavarti sthaan himalay main hai
 Some pheasants spend part of winter in Nilgiri or other hills in the south and others are not found anywhere
 isse itnaa spasht he ki ye ek udaan main kam se kam 2419
5 kilometre kii duuri avashya hi paar karte hai
 Earlier it was believed that migrating birds fly at very high altitudes, because they have the advantage of determining location, decreasing air flow, etc
 kintu ab yah paaya gaya he ki yadi kisi unchi parvatamala ko paar karnaa nahin hua to vastut: ye pravrajan karanevaali chidiyaan 396
24 meter kii oonchaai par udati hai or birli hi chidiya 914
4 meter kii oonchaai tak kii jaati he
 When the sea has to be crossed or there is no barrier of any kind of tree or mountain, then some birds naturally fly even lower than this
 haan, yadi aavashyaktaa hui to chidiyaan bahut kii adhik oonchaai se bhi ud sakati hai
 There is a mention of flying at altitudes ranging from 3
048 meters to 8229
6000 meters
 khajuraho smarak samooh jo ki ek hindu or jain dharm ke smarakon kaa ek samooh he jiske smarak bhartiya rajya madhya pradesh ke chhatarpur kshetra main dekhne ko milte he
 This monument is located about 175 kilometers from southeast Jhansi
 yah smarak samooh unesco vishwa dharohar main bharat kaa ek dharohar kshetra gina jaataa he
 The temples here which were established with Nagara architecture, in which most of the idols are of erotic art, ie most of the idols are set in a naked state
 khahuraho ke zyaadaatar mandir chandel rajvansh ke samay 950 or 1050 isvi ke madhya banaae gaye the
 According to a historical record, Khajuraho has a total of 85 temples which were established in the 12th century and are spread over a 20 square kilometer enclosure
 vartmaan main inamen se, keval 25 mandir hi batch hai jo 6varg kilometre main faile hue hai
 Among the various surviving temples, Kandariya Mahadev Temple is richly decorated with intricate details, symbolism and expression of ancient Indian art

 The temples of Khajuraho Group of Monuments are located in the Chhatarpur district of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, Chhatarpur which is about 620 km from the national capital Delhi
 chhatarpur main ye mandir ek chote kasbe jo ki khajuraho kasbe ke naam se hi janaa jaataa he, jisaki 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar jansankhya takreeban 20,000 he
 Khajuraho also has an airport which serves commuting to Delhi, Agra, Varanasi and Mumbai
 yah dharohar sthal bhartiya railway se bhi judaa hua he arthath yahan najadik hi railway jankshan he jo ki mandir se lagbhag 6 kilometre kii duuri par he
 The group's memorial is 10 km east-west of National Highway 75 and is located about 50 km from the main Chhatarpur city, while this highway connects National Highway 86 to Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh
 lagbhag 10veen shatabdi main rajasthan rajya ke baaraa zile main ek mandir banaaya jo bhaand dev mandir ke naam se prasiddh he
 Its construction is almost like Khajuraho memorial style, hence it was later called Chota Khajuraho
 khajuraho smarak samooh ke mandiron kaa nirmaan nirmaan chandel rajvansh rajvansh ke samay hua tha
 At that time this Chandel dynasty was keeping its footing which later became world famous as Bundelkhand
 inamen adhiktar mandiron kaa nirmaan bhartiya hindu raja yashovarman or dhang ke shashan kaal main hua tha ,yashovarman jo ki ek chandela rajvansh kaa hindu shaasha tha
 The best performance of Yashovarman's legacy has been the Lakshmana temple, while Dhang became famous for Vishwanath Temple
 :22 vartmaan main sabase lokapriy mandir kandaria mahadev mandir he jiskaa nirmaan chandel rajvansh ke shaasha vidyadhar ne karavaaya tha
 Some facts have been found on the records of these temples, which shows that the construction of these temples was completed in 970 to 1030 BC
 khajuraho ke mandir madhyakaalin mahoba shahar se lagbhag 35 mile dur banaaye gaye he, mahoba jo ki us samay kalinger kshetra main chandel rajvansh kii rajdhani thi
 In ancient and medieval literature, his kingdom was also called Jizhati, Jejahoti, Chih-chi-tu and Jejvakkati
 parsi itihaaskaar al beruni kaa kahana he ki or unke saathi mahmud gazanvi ne 1022 isa purv main kalinger par akraman kiya tha jisamen al beruni kaa kahana he ki khajuraho jejahuti kii rajdhani thi
 This attack was unsuccessful because at that time a Hindu ruler reached Mahmud Ghaznavi and negotiated a ransom
 khajuraho ke mandir 12veen shatabdi ke ant tak upyog ke liye sakriy ho gaye the
 They were replaced in the 13th century by the Muslim Sultan Qutub-ud-din Aibak of the Delhi Sultanate by attacking the Chandels
 ek shatabdi baad morocan yatri ibnabatoota ke anusaar wo yahan bharat main 1335 se 1342 isvi tak rukaa tha or inhone khajuraho ke mandiron kii bhi yatra kii thi or unke anusaar us samay khajuraho ko "kajraa" kehete the
 The temples of Khajuraho located in the central Indian region, which were ruled by different Muslim rulers from the 13th to the 18th century, during this period also dealt profanely with many temples
 1495 isa purv main sikandar lodi ne ek abhiyaan chalaa diya tha jisamen khajuraho ke mandiron kaa vinaash kiya gaya tha
 The remote and isolated people of Khajuraho protected Hindu temples and Jain temples from the constant destruction by Muslims
 sadiyon se, vanaspati or jangalon ne adhik se adhik khajuraho ke mandiron kaa adhigrahan kiya
 In the 1930s, local Hindus here helped the British surveyor, TS Burt, rediscover the Khajuraho temples

 Cunningham stated in his work in the 1850s and 1860s that the temples were grouped around the Lakshmana into the western group, the eastern group of the Zaveri and the southern group of the Daldeva

 Due to the religious and political importance of Roman religion and empire, Latin became the dominant language in the whole of Western Europe
 us bhashaa ke granthon kaa adhyayan atyant mahatvapurn maan liya gaya tha
 That language was considered to be a gateway to all knowledge and attainment of knowledge
 paashchaatya koshavidya kaa ankuran bhi inhen latin-shabd-soochiton se hua tha, jinhen glocej kehete the
 The word 'glassy' is also derived from this root
 glocej kaa arth hota tha shabdsuchiyaan
 The readers of 'latin' texts used to write their dubious and difficult words on the margins of the texts
 apni smriti dwaara athwa anya vigyon kii sahaayta se kabhi saral 'latin' main or kabhi usase bhinn swabhaasha main - in shabdon kaa arth bhi halake aksharon main likh lete the
 This word is called 'glass'
 'romanik' bhoomivaasiyon ke liye pracheen roman bhashaa bahut kathin nahin thi
 But that language was inappropriate for the remote people
 at: 'keltic' or 'tutanic' pradeshon ke duurasthon kii drushti main uparyukt 'glass paddati' adhik upyogi hui
 These types of glossaries were created in a wider and more elaborate dimension
 inke madhyam se sackson, english, 'irish' 'praachin german' aadi bhashaaon ke aise pracheen shabdarup bahut bady maatra main surakshit rah gaye hai jinamein un-un bhashaaon ke bahut se shabd aaj anyatra durlabh he
 It is said that Jones' Galandia, which originated in England, built a Latinos Dionysarius in 1224 AD
 latinashbdon kaa yah laghu sangrahakosh tha
 It was created for the usefulness of the early learners of the language as an example of the use of sentences in a thematic manner
 'dictionari' shabd kaa bhi kadachit sarvapratham prayog isi shabdasuchi main hua tha
 Even in the second half of the 14th century some such shells were made
 kalantar main alag patnon par ukt shabdon—arthon kii pratilipiyaan kii jane lageen
 They also began to be collected
 'latin' bhashaa ke clisht shabdon kaa arthbodh karaane ke liye shabdarthsangrah kaa yah kaary atyant upyogi ho gaya he
 The words included in the Tatta lists later went on to say Glasarium, which means word list
 16veen 17veen— main inhen 'glacerium' ke aadhaar par varnakramanusaari shabdasariniyan or clisht—shabdaarth—bodhak sangrahon kaa nirmaan hua
 Akaradikram — Even before the 15th century, two to three hundred years ago, lists of words of various types of different classes were started being stored in different languages of Europe
 in shabdsuchiyon main shabdasankalan vargeekrut hota tha
 Just as Sanskrit's Amarkosh texts find a classless collection of synonyms from their point of view, in the same way, these glossaries include body parts, family relations, human positions and legends, domestic and raised animals, wild animals, fishes, trees, businesses, textiles
 , With the meaning of names of weapons, church materials, diseases etc
 were stored
 inhen 'vocabulerium' kaha jaataa tha
 The word 'vocabulary' in English also originates from this
 kaagaj ke atirikt chamadon par bhi inkaa sangrah hota tha
 Although originally compiled from a different point of view, the practical use of both 'glass' and 'vocabulari' was being used as a tool to aid linguistics
 at: in donon prakaar kii shabdarthasuchiyon kaa praaia" ekatra sangyojan kar diya jane laga
 The masters of glossaries kept adding new words to them, either by self-knowledge or by taking new words from others 'glassery' and 'vocabulari'
 inaki pratilipi karke anya vyakti bhi samay samay par inkaa sangrah praapt kar saktaa tha
 They were spreading and expanding by copy tradition
 sar tamas eliyat kaa nirmit shabdkosh dictionarium vishesh mahatv bhi rakhata he or nutanpath kii bhi pradarshak he
 For the convenience of the early Latin readers of English written by JW Vidals, a short dictionary of 'english-latin' is also written in subjective sections
 parantu 'angreji main latin' kaa kosh hone ke kaaran vishesh mahatv rakhata he
 Of even greater importance was a multilingual Latin dictionary — created in 1339 by the Esteme — which synonymous with English words synonymous with Latin words, as well as several new languages of Europe
 1547 i0 ke baad angreji or navyaeuropea bhashaa ke bhi kosh banane lage
 It was more beneficial to organize the words and phrases alphabetically in terms of utility in these lists circulated through copying
 yaheen se inamen acaradi krmanusaari sangrahapaddati kaa aarambh hota he
 The clerical stored the initial initials of the word or phrase in a sorted list
 usamen dwitiyakshar athwa anupurvi nahin dekhi jaati thi
 Therefore, this method can be called alphabetical initial order
 yah avasthaa sahasron shabdonwali suchi main anubhoot kathinaayee ko dur kar, suvidhajanak paddati ko dhund nikaalane ke sayas vyavastha dwaara prachlit hui
 As a result, it gradually grew and in addition to the initials, attention was also paid to the two letters, the third letters
 phir dhire dhire varnanupurvi ke anusaar aadhunik yug main prachlit paddati se shabdarthsangrah hone laga
 - The lexicon started in English lexicons by first giving the meanings of the first written Latin glossaries in Latin and English
 ha pratham rup tha
 On the second step, English glossaries and Latin and English dictionaries expanded
 — tisare charan main inglish— latin ke shabdasangrah kaa kaary hua
 - In the fourth phase, dictionaries of English and other languages were made
 — paanchave charan main angreji ke clit shabdon ke shabdasangrah vaale ore kosh bane
 Along with adding common words to it, Vetli also tried etymology
 ab shabdaprayogon ke udhaaharan bhi sangruhit hone lage
 - In the sixth stage, the use of citations used in literature started to try and economize the higher level of building
 — isi ke saath saath yaa kuch pehle se hi angranji koshon main prayugyaman bhashaa shabdon ke uccharansanket dene kii bhaavana prarambh hui
 - The eighth position is when Richardson attempted to make sense only through illustration
 or aage chalakar atim rup se in sabaki parinti dow trench kii prerana se nirmit mahakosh main dikhaai detii he
 There has been an attempt to recommend lexicography, word, semantic usage and vowel-related chronology of words etc
 in the dictionary with a detailed and historical dimension
 vistrut vivaran ke liye angreji shabdkoshon kaa itihaas dekhen
 In the initial state of cytology, Western dictionaries also indicate synonyms
 dhire-dhire vibhinn arthon kaa bhi nirdesh hone laga
 But they lacked the meaning of grammar, pronunciation, history of semantics, etymology and rhetoric
 sanskrit koshon main bhi yah nahin tha
 Because they were verses such as metaphysics that introduced one or more meanings through pariahs
 parantu sanskrit ke prasiddh vaiyaakaran 'bhanuji dikshit' dwaara nirmit amarkosh kii 'vyakhyasudha' naamak tikaa main sabhi shabdon kii vyakarnanusaari vgautpatti dene kaa stuty prayaas kiya gaya he
 Historical and linguistic practice in the West led to an attempt to complete the modern form of the dictionary
 prathamtah philips ke kosh main shabdamril kaa vyutpatti ke prasang main nirdesh-maatr hua
 The etymology of the words of the word Sasasam and many similarities is only indicated in this form
 yaheen se angreji koshon main vyutpattipradarshan kaa ati saamaanya aarambh hota he
 Shortly before or around this, instead of giving synonyms for semantics, the method of writing semantic interpretation started
 jaannsan se ekaadh hi varsh purv prakashit martin ke kosh main arthchhayaon ko yadhyapi vistrut sandarbh main dekhne kaa prayaas hua, tathaapi vyutpattisanket vahaan lupt ho gaya
 Jansan's dictionary includes many illustrations and examples as well as mementical examples of the word reader
 sanketarup main mul shabd ke nirdesh maatr se vyutpattisambandh kaa sachan kiya jaataa tha
 Synonyms were also given in French
 sheridan or vaakar ke kosh, jaannsan kii apeksha alp mahatv ke hone par bhi uccharansanket kii disha main adhik prayatnsheel rahe
 In Webster's dictionary, the greatest efforts were made to use the prioritizations related to the composition of the cell on a small scale
 duusari ore purvokt visheshtaon ke atirikt dow richardsan ke kosh main latin ke saath francisi itali, spani bhashaa ke shabdon kaa upanyaas yah suchit karata he ki us yug ke koshkaron kii chetana udabuddhatar ho rahi thi or tulanaatmak drushti kaa vikaas hone laga tha
 In this other dictionary, the trend of comparative forms disappeared, but the effect of some encyclopaedic method was started in the economy
 1860 ke 'webster' ke kosh main punah latin, itali, spani or frasisi shabdarupon se bhi tulanaatmak bidh kaa abhas miltaa he par angreji koshon kii yah seemaa inhen bhashaaon ke ghere main paddy rahi
 Gradually, the use of the materials of the ideal composition legislation of cells - in small or large quantities - was beginning to occur even before the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary
 par unamem vaigyanik or aitihaasik aadhaar sarvatha pusht or suvyavasthit nahin the
 Those products were not arranged in a single dictionary in a different order and were radiated in different ways
 phir bhi unase koshanirmaan ke aavashyak upaadaanon kii upyogita suchit or nirdeshit hi chuki thi
 Historical and linguistic maturity along with the completeness, accuracy and correctness of the economies in the later lexicons increased compared to the earlier lexicons
 dow trench kii manisha ne samast purvasankethik upaadaanon ke samuchit viniyog evam samavesh kaa linganirdesh kiya
 He properly understood the importance of their use in a systematic and planned manner and with their proper and systematic appropriation and experimentation, tried to push the work of lexicon towards perfection
 keoladev rashtriya udyaan yaa keoladev ghanaa rashtriya udyaan bharat ke rajasthan main sthit ek vikhyath pakshi abhayaarany he
 It was formerly known as Bharatpur Bird Vihar
 isamen hajaaron kii sankhya main durlabh or vilupt jati ke pakshi paae jate hai, jaise saiberia se aaye saras, jo yahan sardiyon ke mausam main aate hai
 Here 230 species of birds have made their home in the National Park of India
 ab yah ek bahut bada paryaton sthal or kendra ban gaya he, jahaan par bahutayat main pakshivigyaani sheet ritu main aate hai
 It was declared a protected bird sanctuary in 1971 and later in 1985 it has also been declared as a 'world Heritage'
 is pakshivihar kaa nirmaan 250 varsh pehle kiya gaya tha or iskaa naam keoladev mandir ke naam par rakhaa gaya tha
 This temple is located in this bird sanctuary

 Here, annual hunting of birds was organized in honor of the British Viceroy
 1938 main kareeb 4,273 pakshiyon kaa shikaar sirf ek hi din main kiya gaya melord evam teal jaise pakshi bahutayat main maare gayi
 The Governor of India at that time was General Linlithgow, who, along with his colleague Victor Hope, made them his victims
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad bhi 1972 tak bharatpur ke purv raja ko unke kshetra main shikaar karne kii anumati thi, lekin 1982 se udyaan main chaara lene par bhi pratibandh laga diya gaya jo yahan ke kisaanon, gurjar samudaay or sarkaar ke bich hinsak ladaai kaa kaaran bana
 This bird house becomes the 'second home' of rare species of birds in the winter season
 saiberian saras, ghomara, uttari shah chakva, jalpakshi, laalsar battakh aadi jaise viluptpraaya jati ke anekanek pakshi yahan apana baseraa karte hai
 In late 2004, the government of Vasundhara Raje succumbed to the coercion of the farmers and the water sent to the bird was stopped, which resulted in the water supply for the garden reduced from 540,000,000 to 18,000,000 cubic feet
 She left

 Describing the hunting of birds as condemnable by environmental experts, they have filed a PIL in the court against it

 These forests extend from Newfoundland and Labrador Prefecture adjoining the Atlantic Ocean in the east to Alaska in the United States of Canada in the west
 praani yaa jantu yaa jaanavar 'animelia' yaa metazoa jagat ke bahukoshikeey or sukendrik jeevon kaa ek mukhya samooh he
 After being born, as a creature grows up, its physical plan evolves as prescribed, although some animals go through life in the process of metamorphosis
 adhikansh jantu gatisheel hote hai, arthath apane aap or swatantra rup se gati kar sakate hai
 Most animals are also hostile, that is, they depend on other animals to live
 adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh 542 karod saal pehle cambrian visphot ke dauraan jeevashm record main samudri prajatiyon ke rup main prakat hue
 The word 'animal' comes from the Latin language Animaale, the Nutter of Animalis, and is derived from Anima, meaning living breath or spirit
 aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa main, is shabd kaa istemaal gaiyr-maanviya jaanwaron ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The biological definition of the term includes all members of the Kingdom Animalaya, including humans
 jantuon main kai vishesh gun hote hai jo unhen anya sajiv vastuon se alag karte hai
 Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular, separating them from bacteria and most protists
 ve parposhi hote hai, saamanytah ek aantarik kaksh main bhojan kaa pachan karte hai, yah lakshan unhen paudhon va shaiwal se alag banaata he, ve bhi paudhon, shaiwalon or kavakon se vibhedit kiye ja sakate hen kyonki unamem kathor koshika bhitti kaa abhaav hota he, sabhi jantu gatisheel hote hai, chaahe jivan kii kisi vishesh pravastha main hi kyon na hon
 In most animals, the embryo passes through a blastula stage, a differential property of animals
 kuch apwaadon ke saath, sabase khaskar spanj or placosoa, jantuon ke sharir alag-alag utakon main vibhedit hote hai
 These include muscles, which are able to control contraction and movement, and nerve tissues, which send and respond to signals
 saath hi inamen ek praroopik aantarik pachan kaksh hota he jo 1 yaa 2 chhidron se yukt hota he
 Animals that have this type of organization are called metazoans, or eumetazoans when the former is commonly used for animals
 sabhi jantuon main eukeriotic koshikaayen hoti hai, jo colejan or pratyasth glycoprotein se bane bahirkoshikeey metrics se ghiri hoti hai
 It can be calcified to form structures such as shell, bone and spines
 vikaas ke dauraan yah ek apekshaakrit lacheela dhaancha bana leti hai jis par koshikaayen gati kar sakati hai or sambhav jatil saranchanaaen banaate hue punah sangathit ho sakati hai
 In contrast, cells of other multicellular organisms such as plants and fungi are surrounded by cell walls and thus develop by progressive growth
 iske alaava, jantuon kii koshikaon kaa ek adwitiya gun he antar koshikeey sandhiyaan: tite jankshan, gap jankshan or desmosome
 Almost all animals undergo some type of sexual reproduction process: polyploidy
 in main kuch vishesh prajnan koshikaayen hai jo chote gatisheel shukranujan yaa bade gatiheen andj ke utpaadan hetu ardhsutri vibhaajan karti hai
 They converge to form zygotes, which develop into new organisms
 kai jantuon main alangik prajnan kii kshamta bhi hoti he
 This can occur through anesthesia, where the egg develops into the embryo without fertilization, in some cases by fragmentation
 yugmanaj shuru main blastula naamak ek khokhale gole main viksit hota he, yah koshikaon kii punarvyavastha tathaa vibhedan kii prakriya se hokar gujarata he
 In the sponge, the blastula larva swims to a new location and develops into a new sponge
 adhikansh anya samoohon main, blastula main adhik jatil punarvyavastha kii prakriya hoti he
 It first intercalates to form a gastrula, which consists of a digestive chamber and two separate germ levels — an outer ectoderm and an internal endoderm
 shikaar ek jaivik antarkriya he jisamen ek shikari apane shikaar se bhojan praapt karata he
 Hunters may or may not kill their prey before eating, but the process of hunting always results in the death of the prey
 upbhog kii ek anya mukhya shrenee he mritposhan, mrit carbonic padaarth kaa upbhog
 It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between these two types of food behavior, for example, a parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay its eggs on it, so that their offspring receive food from its decomposing organic material
 can do
 ek duusare par lagaaye gaye chaynit dabaav ne shikaar or shikari ke bich vikasvaadi daud ko janm diya he, jiske parinamswaroop kai shikari virdohi anukulan viksit hue hai
 Most animals receive energy indirectly from sunlight
 paudhe prakaash sanshleshan naamak ek prakriya ke dwaara is urja kaa prayog karke surya ke prakaash ko saadhaaran sharkara ke anu main parivartit kar dete hai
 The process of photosynthesis begins with carbon dioxide and water, converting sunlight energy into chemical energy, which accumulates in the bonds of glucose, releasing oxygen during the process
 ab is sharkara kaa upyog nirmaan ikaayiyon ke rup main hota he, jisase paudhe main vruddhi hoti he
 When animals eat these plants, the sugars produced by the plants are used by animals
 yah yaa to jantu ke pratyaksh vikaas main sahaayak hoti he yaa apaghatit ho jaati he or sangrahit saura urja chhorati he or is prakaar se jantu ko gati ke liye aavashyak urja kii prapti hoti he
 This process is known as glycolysis
 jantu jo jal ushma nikaas ke kareeb yaa samudri tal par thande risaav ke najadik rahete hai, ve surya kii urja par nirbhar nahin hai
 Instead, synthesized organisms and bacteria form the basis of the food chain
 ] There is a general belief that animals have evolved from a flagellate eukaryote
 unke nikatatam gyaat sajiv sambandhi hai koeno kashabhiki, colerd kashabhiki jinaki aakaariki vishisht spanjon ke koeno cites ke saamaan he
 Molecular studies place animals in a superfamily group, called opisthokonts, which also include animals from the koeno flagellum, fungi and some small parasitic protists
 pehle jeevashm jo jantuon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, lagbhag 610 million varsh purv, purvacambrian kaal ke ant main prakat hue or ye adiakaran yaa vendian biota kehalaate hai
 But these are difficult to relate to later fossils
 Some may represent the predecessors of modern associations, but they may be distinct groups, and it is also possible that they are not actually animals
 unhen chhod kar, adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh, 542 million varsh purv, cambrian yug ke dauraan, swatah hi prakat hue
 It is still disputed whether this phenomenon, called the Cambrian explosion, represents a sharp divergence between different groups or the changes in conditions that made fossilization possible
 haalaanki kuch puratatvigyaani or bhuvaigyanik bataate hai ki jantu pehle soche jane vaale samay se kaaphi pehle prakat hue, sambhawatah 1 billian varsh purv
tonian yug main paae gaye jeevashm chinh jaise maarg or bill, tristareey krimiyon jaise metazoa kii upasthiti ko suchit karte hai, ye sambhawatah kentue kii tarah bade or jatil rahe honge 
 Also at the beginning of the Tonian era, stromatolite decreased about 1 billion years ago
 vividhta jo is samay stromatolait ke rup main charne vaale pashuon ke aagaman ko suchit karti he, ne ordovisian or parmian ke ant ke kuch hi samay baad, vividhta main vruddhi kii, jisase badi sankhya main charne vaale samudri jantu lupt ho gaye, unki jansankhya main punah prapti ke kuch hi samay baad unki sankhya main kami aa gayi
 The discovery, which is very similar to these early fossil marks, has its origins in the present-day giant size single-organism Protista organism Gromia sphaerica, doubting their interpretation as evidence of early animal development
 lambey arase pehle se spanj ko anya praarambhik jantuon se bhinn mana jaataa tha
 As noted above, the complex organization found in most other associations is not found in them, their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into separate tissues
 spanj tane rahit hote hai or aam taur par inke chhidron ke madhyam se jal khinch kar bhojan praapt karte hai
 Archaeocyatha, which have a fused skeleton, may represent a sponge or a different association
 haalaanki, 2008 main 21 vanshon main 150 jeenon kaa ek faillo jinomik adhyayan bataata he ki yah tinophora yaa comb jelly he jo kam se kam un 21 sanghon main jantuo kaa aadhaar banaati he
 The authors believe that sponges — or at least the sponges they have discovered — are not so primitive, but can instead be simplified secondary
 anya sangho main, tinophora or nideria, jinamein samudri anemon, coral or jelifish shaamil hai, trigyat samamit hote hai, inamen ek hi chhidr se yukt pachan kaksh hota he, jo mukh or guda donon kaa kaam karata he
 Both have distinctly differentiated tissues, but are not organized into organs
 inamen keval do mukhya janan str hote hai, bahya tvak str or antah tvak str, jinke bich main keval koshikaayen bikhri hoti hai
 That is why these animals are sometimes called diploblastic
 chote placosoa samaan hai, lekin un main ek sthaayee pachan kaksh nahin hota he
 The remaining animals form a federal group called the bilateria
 adhiktam bhaag ke liye, ve dwiparshv samamit hote hai or aksar ek vishishtikrut sir hota he jo khaadya angon or samvedi angon se yukt hota he
 The body is tripleblastic, that is, all three reproductive layers are fully developed and tissues form differentiated organs
 pachan kaksh main do chhidr hote hai, ek mukh or ek guda, saath hi ek aantarik deh guha bhi hoti he jo ceylom yaa abhaasi deh guha bhi kehalaati he
 There are exceptions to each of these traits, however - adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and have very simplified physiological structures in typical parasitic animals
 anuvanshik adhyayan nen bailetria ke bheetar sambandh ko lekar hamaare gyaan ko kaaphi had tak badal diya he
 Most belong to two main genealogies: Deuterostomes and Protostomes, including Ecdysozoa, Platyzoa, and Lophotrochozoa
 is ke atirikt, dwiparshvasamamit jeevon ke kuch chote samooh hai jo in mukhya samoohon ke samaksh visarit hote hue prathit hote hai
 These include Aesolomorpha, Rhombozoa and Orthonectida
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mixojoa, ek koshikeey paraseete jinhen mul rup se protogon mana jaataa tha, bailetria se hi viksit hue hai
 Deuterostomes differ in many ways from other bilateria, protostomes
 donon hi maamalon main ek puraa pachan path paaya jaataa he
 However, in the protostome, the initial pore develops in the mouth and the anus develops separately
 duterostome main yah ulat he
 In most protostomes, cells normally fill in the inner part of the gastrula and form the middle reproductive level, this is called Schizosillus development, but in the deuterostome it is formed by the intracellular level of innervation, known as entrosylic pouching
 duterostome main adhar ke bajaay prishthiya tantrika rajju hota he or unke bhrun main bhinn prakaar kaa vidalan hota he
 All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are distinctly federal levels
 duterostome ke pramukh sangh hai, ekainodermanta or cordeta
 The former is radially symmetric and is particularly marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers
 duusare vaale main mukhya rup se kasheruki jeev hai jinamein ridh kii haddi pai jaati he
 These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
 inke atirikt duterostome main hemicordeta or ekon krimi bhi shaamil hai
 Although they are not currently found predominantly, significant fossil evidence relates to them
 chetognetha yaa tir krimi bhi duterostome ho sakate hai, lekin adhik haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan protostome ke saath inke saannnidhya ko darshaate hai
 Ecdysozoa are protostomes, which have been named on the basis of a characteristic characteristic of growth by moulting or release
 sabase bada jantu sangh, aarthropoda inase sambandh rakhata he, jisamen krimi, makadiyaan, kekade or unke nikat sambandhi shaamil hai
 The body is divided into segments and typically there are paired appendages
 do chote sangh onicofora or taradegrada, aarthropoda ke nikat sambandhi hai or inamen bhi unke samaan lakshan paae jate hai
 The nematoda or round worm comes in Ekadisozoa, the second largest animal association
 golkrimi aam taur par sookshm jeev hote hai or lagbhag har aise vaataavaran main utpann ho jate hai jahaan pani hota he
 There are many important parasites

 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization

 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent

 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into several rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to reach the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks

 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide

 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros
 yahan ke nagaron main anek vyavsaay-dhandhe prachlit the
 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stages
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area
 ve chakke se parichit the or sambhawatah aajkal ke ikke jaisaa koi vaahan prayog karte the
 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-government institution like Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze
 tambe tathaa tin milakar dhaatushilpi kaansya kaa nirmaan karte the
 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing
 harappai lipi kaa pehla namoona 1853 isvi main mila tha or 1923 main puri lipi prakaash main ai parantu ab tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier

 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
 aisa lagata he ki is sabhyataa ke patan kaa koi ek kaaran nahin tha balki vibhinn kaarnon ke mail se aisa hua
 Which is likely to happen at different times or together
 mohenjo daro main nagar or jal nikaas ki vyavastha se mahamari ki sambhaavna kam lagati he

 X-rays or X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is 10 to 0
01 nanometers
 yah chikitsa main nidaan ke liye sarvaadhik prayog kii jaati he
 It is a type of ionizing radiation, therefore dangerous
 kai bhashaaon main ise rontjan vikiran bhi kehete hai, jo ki iske anveshak wilhelm coored rontjan ke naam par aadhaarit he
 The Röntgen equivalent human is its classical measuring unit
 germany main vurtsburg vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke praadhyaapak wilhelm conrad rantjan ne 1895 main eksre kaa avishkaar kiya
 If the air from the glass tube is pumped out and electrified in a high voltage respectively, then the air starts to self-illuminate when the pressure is low enough
 is ghatana kaa praayogic adhyayan karte samay rantjan ne yah dekha ki vaayu kaa daab atyant alp hone par kaach kii nalika main se jo kirane aati hai, unase barium platinosynide ke manibh prakaash dene lagate hai or, nalika ko kaale kaagaj se purna rup se dhakne par bhi, paas main rakhe manibh dhyutimaan hote rahete hai
 Therefore, it was clear that the rays coming out of the esophagus could easily pass through the black paper and these rays have the special property of damaging the screen of barium platenocyanide
 vigyaan main is prakaar kii kirane tab tak gyaat nahin thim
 So these newly invented rays were named 'x-rays', but in honor of Rantzen, especially in Germany, these rays are called 'rantzen rays'
 rantjan ke avishkaar ke prakashit hote hi sampurna vaigyanik vishwa kaa dhyaan eksre kii ore aakrisht hua
 The x-ray property of crossing through opaque solids was extremely important and this property could be used in many departments of science
 at: anek bhautikee prayogshaalaon main eksre ke utpaadan tathaa unke gundharmo ke adhyayan ke praytn hone lage
 The study of electric immersion in air at low pressure has a special place in the development of modern physics
 yadi kaanch kii ek lambii nalika ko nirvaat pump se jodakar bheetar kii vaayu main ucch vibhav kii vidyudwara pravaahit kii jaae to prarambh main, jab daab adhik rahati he tab, koi kriya dikhaai nahin detii, kintu vaayu kii daab jab alp ho jaati he tab pehle donon vidyudagr dhyutimaan hote hai
 Lowering the pressure further reduces the entire tube
 aadhunik bhautikee kii vyakhya ke anusaar iskaa kaaran he ki jab electranon ko urja praapt hoti he or ve dhanagar kii ore ati veg se jate samay shesh vaayu ke anuon se sanghaat karte hai
 The ions of molecules are formed due to the collisions and when these ions get to the previous state then light is emitted
 yanon ke astitv ke kaaran vaayu main vidyudvisarjan jari rahata he
 When the pressure is too low, there are not enough molecules to collide with the electrons; Therefore, the electrons come out of the minuscule and collide directly with the material with all their energy
 in sanghaton ke kaaran electranon kii teevr urja dhanagar ke parmaanuon ko mil jaati he or iskaa ek parinaam eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 This method requires a critical pressure in the tube to produce an x-ray
 vaayu kii daab yadi is kranthik daab se adhik ho to eksre ke utpaadan ke liye paryaapt urja electranon main nahin rahati 
 On the other hand, if the pressure is less than this critical pressure, electrons are not generated, so the electric discharge stops
 prarambh main eksre kaa utpaadan isi prakaar kii vayunalee kaa upyog karke kiya jaataa tha or vaayu kii daab ko mahatprayas se is kranthik daab ke maan par rakhaa jaataa tha
 Two special properties of X-rays are more important: tivrathamapan kii teen mukhya vidhiyaan hai
 The intensity of the fluorescence from the X-ray on the fluorescent screen — to the extent of the illumination — is proportional to the intensity of the X-ray
 pratidipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan karke eksre kii tivrata kii tulana sthool rup se ho sakati he
 In the second method, the action of X-ray above the photo palette is used
 eksre ke aapatan se photo pattica par jo kaalaapan aata he, vah eksre kii tivrata tathaa aapatan kaal par nirbhar rahata he
 This method allows the action of an X-ray of greater intensity to take place at the appropriate place on a photo plate with a higher intensity of the X-ray beam, and then the action of the second X-ray beam on the same plaque down t, 2t
 , 3t etc
 pattica ko viksit karne ke pashchaat donon chitron ke kaalepan kii tulana karne se donon punjon kii saapeksh tivrata kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 The third method of intensity measurement is more prevalent, because intensity can be measured precisely in this manner
 jab eksre vaayu main se jaati he tab vaayu vidyucchalak ho jaati he or uski chaalakata eksre kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The electrons of air molecules are displaced by the action of X-rays and ions are produced
 uchit vidyudvibhav kii upasthiti main yanon se jo vidyuddhara praapt hoti he, vah samvedi vidyunmapi se, athwa anya uchit samvedi upkarnon se, maapi ja sakati he
 The intensity of the x-ray is proportional to the electrode
 haal main gunak-prakashanalika or eksre-samvedi sphur ke upyog se tivrata kaa maapan atyant sulabh ho gaya he
 Similarly, the stream of ionization can also be easily measured with the help of a gelatinizer
 at: vartmaankaal main in donon prakaar ke upkarnon dwaara eksre kii tivrata kaa maapan adhik prachlit he
 These three popular methods of intensity measurement can only compare the intensities of the two x-ray elements, the absolute intensity cannot be achieved
 apati eksre ke lambavat ek varg centimetre kshetrafal par prati senkad jo urja padati he, usko vastut: ham us eksre kii tivrata kah sakate hai
 This intensity is expressed in ergs per square centimeter per second
 tivrata kaa maapan urja ke rup main karne ke liye eksre kii urja ko ushma atyant alp hone ke kaaran is reeti se tivrathamapan ke liye atyant sookshmagrahi vishisht upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this manner, Terrill made the first attempt to intensify
 iske pashchaat 1953 i
 main america main ilinay vishvavidhyalay ke henderson, beati evam laafan ne bhi praytn kiye
 The intensity of the x-ray generated by very high current can only be measured in this way
 bhautikee ke praayogic kaaryo main sadaa ekakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or maapi gai raashi ke anusaar iskaa swaroop hota he
 The unit of X-ray quantity is called 'rantzen' and in the present tense the definition of a Rantzen is as follows- eksre kaa doosraa vishesh gundharm unki thos padaartho main praveshkshmata he
 The decrease in the intensity of the X-ray is not the same when the different solids are passed through the same mass
 kuch thos padaartho main eksre kaa avasorana adhik hota he ore kuch padaartho main kam
 The result of this experiment is that if the x-ray crosses the different mots of a particular solid, then the output x-ray is related to the intensity, initial intensity and thickness of the solid according to the following equation: log = – m × motaai --- Here = initial intensity of x-ray; i = thos padaarth main se paar hone ke pashchaat eksre kii tivrata; m = a constant, called the absorption multiplier
 is sthiraank ko us thos vishesh eksre-avasorana-gunak kehete hai
 In fact it is a linear multiplier
 isko vyapak rup main vyakt karne ke liye main us thos padaarth ke ghanatv kaa bhaag diya jaataa he or is prakaar praapt avasorana gunank ko 'sanhati-avasorana-gunank' kehete hai
 Therefore mmass = m / ghanatv The special significance of the Samhita-absorption-multiplier is that it is the characteristic property of the absorbing material
 udaahranarth, jal or bhaap kaa rekhiy avasorana-gunak bhinn hota he, kyonki jal drav he or bhaap gas hai
 But the x-ray code-absorption-coefficient of water and steam is the same, because the chemical preservatives of water and steam are integral, namely, hydrogen and oxygen
 prakaash or eksre ke gundharmo kii bhinnata sanhati-avasorana-gunak se atyant spasht ho jaati he
 Generally, liquids and solids are themselves opaque or translucent to light
 prakaash ke liye hira paardarshee or graphite apaardarshee he, parantu eksre kaa sanhati-avasorana-gunank hira tathaa graphite ke liye samaan hi rahata he, kyonki ye donon padaarth vastut: carbon ke hi vibhinn swaroop hai
 Absorption coefficients of the entire X-rays from the X-ray tube are mainly dependent on both the electrical current and the atomic number of the metal of the absorber screen
 jaise jaise vibhav badhata jaataa he vaise hi vaise utpaadit eksre kii praveshkshmata athwa kathorta badhati jaati he
 The equation leads to the conclusion that the absorption multiplier for a single solid will be constant for all the masses
 kintu pratyaksh prayog main eksre nalika se praapt vikiran kaa nune praveshkshamtawala bhaag avasorak parade ke pratham staron main hi purnataya avashoshit ho jaataa he 
 Only X-rays of high penetrability reach the final levels of the absorption screen
 spasht he ki avasorana parade main pravesh karanevaale eksre kaa avasorana gunank parade se paar nikle hue eksre ke avasorana gunak se adhik hota he
 When the absorption multiplier of all x-rays is the same, then they are called homogeneous x-rays
 at: eksre kii maatra unki tivrata se or unki visheshta unke avasorana-gunak se maapit hota he
 We can see the matter from which light comes, because light rays have an action on the design of our eye
 is prakaar kii kriya eksre dwaara nahin hoti, at: eksre drishy nahin hai
 Not only this, the action of each other on the eyes and other parts of the body is very harmful
 jivit koshaaon par eksre kii paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se ve mritt ho jaati hai
 X-rays easily cross through the skin and they are likely to die due to their long-term action on the living cells within
 phir, eksre ke prabhaav tikaoo hote he; at: sharir ke ek hi sthaan par bhinn-bhinn samayon par bhi eksre kii kriya hoti rahane par kuch kaal main cancer sadrush du:saadhy rog ho jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to work very carefully while using X-ray
 sharir kii raksha ke liye vishesh saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 In addition, current x-ray users keep an x-ray-measure in their pocket in the present tense, which shows how much radiation has worked on the employee
 eksre ke is ghaatak gundharm kaa anya rogon main upyog bhi kiya jaataa he; jaise, sharir ke kisi bhaag main anisht roganuon kii vruddhi hoti ho to unpar eksre kaa prayog karke unhen nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays are used more in medicine, especially in surgery
 is prakaar ke upyog kii sambhaavna eksre ke avishkaar ke samay se hi spasht thi
 Different elements of the body have different absorption-multipliers; Therefore, by taking an x-ray from any part of the body and taking a photo, the bones and other components are seen separately
 at: shalya kriya ke purv, athwa yah gyaat karne ke liye ki rog kis avasthaa main he eksre photo atyant upyogi hote hai
 As the production of X-rays progressed, they started to be used in industries as well, and in the present times the use of X-rays in metallurgy has become necessary
 urja yaa to kanon ke saath athwa tarangon ke saath sanyukt rahati he
 If energy is emitted from an origin, the existence of this energy is usually expressed in the intensity of electromagnetic waves, or as the kinetic energy of particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, ions etc
 tarang or kan ke swaroop bhinn hote hai; isliye inako saadhaarant: bhinn virgo main rakhaa jaataa he
 But it has become clear from the results of many experiments that the bonding of these classes has properties of particles in waves and, conversely, particles also have properties of waves
 is dwait rup kaa prarambh plank ke ushmavikiran ke siddhant se prarambh hua
 The properties of X-rays are also no exception to this dual form

 As the x-ray wavelength is much less than the wavelength of light, there are many difficulties in using experiments for x-rays, by which the wavelength of light can be easily measured

 Some of the experiments by which the x-ray waveform is proved are given below- eksre se manibh sanrachana jaanane main vishesh sahaayta milti he 
 Apart from medical uses, X-rays are also used in many ways
 eksre ke vishisht gunon ke kaaran unka upyog vistrut rup se vigyaan kii anek shakhaon tathaa vibhinn udyogon main hota aa rahaa he
 X-rays are used a lot in industries, especially in the construction and control of the properties of manufactured materials

 Thus X-rays are of particular use in obtaining flawless metals with specific properties
 eksre ke anya upyogon main eksre sookshmdarshi ullekhneey he
 The wavelengths of X-rays are smaller than the wavelengths of light, so X-ray microscopes should be more effective than light microscopes

 He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his discovery of theoretical physics, especially photoelectric emission
 instine ne saamaanya aapekshikta or saamaanya aapekshikta ke siddhant sahit kai yogadan die
 His other contributions include Relative Universe, capillary motion, critical subduction, numerical mechanics problems, Brownian motion of molecules, mutation probability of molecules, quantum theory of gas with one molecule, thermal properties of light with low radiation density, theory of radiation, Geometry of integrated field theory and physics is included
 oinstin ne pachaas se adhik shodh-patr or vigyaan se alag kitaaben likhin
 In 1999, Time magazine declared shatabdi-purush

 Einstein's intellectual achievements and singularities have made the term "einstein" synonymous with "intelligent"
 albert oinstin kaa janm germany main wootemberg ke ek yahudee parivaar main hua
 His father was an engineer and salesman
 unki maan paulin oinstin thi
 Although Einstein had difficulty speaking initially, he topped the studies
 unki maatrubhaasha german thi or baad main unhone italvi or angreji bhi sikhi
 In 1880 his family moved to the city of Munich, where his father and uncle jointly opened a company called "electrotechnic Frébich J
 Einstein & See", which manufactured electrical appliances
 or isane munich ke Oktoberfest meley main pehali baar roshni kaa prabandh bhi kiya tha
 His family did not believe in Jewish religious traditions, and for this reason Einstein could go to Catholic school
 apni maan ke kehane par unhone sarangi bajaanaa siikhaa
 He did not like this and later abandoned it, but later he enjoyed Mozart's Sarangi music
 1894 main, unke pita kii company ko munich shahar main vidyut prakaash vyavastha ke liye aapurti karne kaa anubandh nahin mil sakaa
 Due to the loss, he had to sell his company
 vyapaar kii talash main, oinstin parivaar italy chale gaye, jahaan ve sabase pehle milan or phir kuch maheene baad pavia shahar main bas gayi
 Even after the family left for Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to complete his studies
 disambar 1894 ke ant main, unhone pavia main apane parivaar se milane italy kii yatra kii
 During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay titled "examining the state of the ether in a magnetic field"
 apane puure jeevankaal main, oinstin ne saikadon kitaaben or lekh prakashit kiye
 He published more than 300 scientific and 150 non-scientific research papers
 1965 ke apane vyaakhyaan main, oppenheimar ne ullekh kiya ki oinstin ke praarambhik lekhan main kai trutiyon hoti thi jiske kaaran unke prakaashan main lagbhag das varshon kii deree ho chuki thi: " ek aadmi jiskaa trutiyon ko hi sahi karne main ek lanbaa samay lage, kitna mahaan hoga"
 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more
 
 Anus Mirabilis Papers is related to four articles that Einstein published in 1905 in a scientific journal called Onlen der Physik, which included photoelectric effects, Brownian motion, special relativism, and e = mc2
 in chaar lekhon ne aadhunik bhautikee kii neenv ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he or antariksh, samay tathaa dravya par logo kii soch ko badla he
 These four papers are: san 1900 main onalen der physic ko prastut, oinstin ke pehla shodh-patr "keshika aakarshan" par tha
 It was published in 1901 with the title "extracts from capillary phenomena"
 1902-1903 main prakashit do patron main parmanuviya ghatana kii vyakhya, sankhyikeey ke madhyam se karne kaa prayaas kiya
 This paper formed the foundation for a 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian motion can be used as concrete evidence for the presence of molecules
 1903 or 1904 main unka shodh mukhya rup se, prasar ghatana par parimit parmaanu aakaar kaa asar par sambandhit rahe
 He expressed the principle of relativity
