 alankaar alankruti ; alankaar : alam arthath bhushan
 The one who does it, is an ornament
 alankaar, kavita-kamini ke soundarya ko badhaane vaale tatv hote hai
 Just as ornamentation increases the beauty of a woman, similarly the ornamentation enhances the beauty of the poem
 kaha gaya he - 'alankaroti iti alankaari' bhartiya sahitya main anupras, upama, roopak, ananvay, yamak, shlesh, utpreksha, andeh, atishyokti, vakrokti aadi pramukh alankaar hai
 For this reason, etymology etc
 is etymologically called etymology
 upama aadi ke liye alankaar shabd kaa sankuchit arth main prayog kiya gaya he
 In the broadest sense, mere beauty is called Alankar and from that is taken poetry
 
 Charutva is also called Alankara
 
 From the view of Bhamah, Varkarthvija is the name of a word or word of words
 rudrat abhidhaanprakaaravishesh ko hi alankaar kehete hai
 
 dandi ke liye alankaar kavy ke shobhaakar dharm hai 
 Beauty, Charity, Kavyashobhakar Dharma The use of the word 'alankar' in these three forms is widely used and in the rest in the narrow sense of alliterative ornaments of the word and meaning
 ek main alankaar kavy ke pranbhoot tatv ke rup main grahit hai or duusare main susajjitakarta ke rup main
 Generally, decorations are used with the idea of giving expression to the utmost good
 inke dwaara yaa to bhaavon ko utkarsh pradaan kiya jaataa he yaa rup, gun, tathaa kriya kaa adhik teevr anubhav karaayaa jaataa he
 Therefore, the power of the mind is the real cause of ornaments
 ruchibhed aenbar or chamatkarpriy vyakti shabdalankaron kaa or bhavuk vyakti arthalankaron kaa prayog karata he
 In the use of syllogism, the main basic principles of purity, effort, utterance and phonation are considered and repetition itself is considered to be frequency, with three distinctions from the order of its letter, word and verse, including alliteration and chhek and yamaka, paruktakdabhasa and latanupras
 Is assumed
 vrityanupras prayatnlaghav kaa udhaaharan he
 The discovery of vrittis and customs is due to this effort
 shrutyanupras main dhvanisamya spasht he hi
 In addition to these tendencies, curiosity, curiosity, allegorization and the desire to enjoy pleasure in the work of pictorial works are employed in the creation of the paintings
 bhavabhivyanjan, newnadhikarini tathaa tarkna naamak manovritiyon ke aadhaar par arthalankaron kaa gathan hota he
 All areas of knowledge carry the content of ornaments, such as grammatical based on adverbial and adjective-adjective-based ornaments
 manovigyaan se samaran, bhram, andeh tathaa utpreksha kii saamagree lee jaati he, darshan se kaary-kaaran-sambandhi asangati, hetu tathaa pramaan aadi alankaar liye jate hai or nyaayashastra ke kramash: vaakyanyay, tarkanyay tathaa lokanyay bhed karke anek alankaar gathit hote hai
 Some ornaments such as Upma are related to physics and Rasalankar, Bhawalankar and Kriyachturiwale ornaments are derived from the Natyashastra
 aacharyon ne kavyasharir, uske nityadharm tathaa bahirang upakaarak kaa vichaar karte hue kavy main alankaar ke sthaan or mahatv kaa vyaakhyaan kiya he
 In this regard, they are considered in terms of virtue, quality, juice, sound and self
 shobhasrashta ke rup main alankaar swayan alankaarya hi maan liye jate hai or shobhaa ke vruddhikaarak ke rup main ve aabhushan ke samaan upakaarak maatr maane jate hai
 In the first form he is called Nityadharma of poetry and in the second form he is called Anityadharma
 is prakaar ke vichaaron se alankarishastra main do pakshon kii neenv pad gai
 One side, who considers Ras to be the soul of poetry, considers the ornaments as secondary, and the other side accepts them as non-religious religion instead of virtues
 kavy ke sharir kii kalpana karke unka nirupan kiya jane laga
 Acharya Vamana, while assuming a wider meaning, considered the ornaments not to be the graceful religion of poetry while discussing the narrow meaning, only to bring them extravagance in virtues
 acharya aanandavardhan ne inhen kavyasharir par katckkundal aadi ke sadrush maatr mana he
 
 acharya mammat ne gunon ko shauryadik angi dharmon ke samaan tathaa alankaaron ko un gunon kaa angadvara se upkaar karanevaala bataakar unheen kaa anusaran kiya he unhone gunon ko nity tathaa alankaaron ko anitya maanakar kavy main unke na rahane par bhi koi haani nahin maani 
 Both Acharya Hemachandra and Acharya Vishwanath considered him to be unpatriotic
 hemchandra ne to "angashritastvalankara:" kaha hi he or vishwanath ne unhen asthir dharm batakar kavy main gunon ke samaan aavashyak nahin mana he 
 Similarly, even though Agnipuranakara has accepted the primacy of rasa in poetry by saying "rasaevatrishtam on Vagavadhyagadhyapradhana", he does not consider ornaments to be a superfluous reason
 in maton ke virodh main 13veen shatee main jayadev ne alankaaron ko kavyadharm ke rup main pratishthit karte hue unhen anivaary sthaan diya he
 a person who does not believe in fire, he will be the one who does not believe in poetry
 alankaar kavy ke nityadharm hai 
 In spite of this controversy, the coordinators like Anandavardhan have not hesitated to consider them as internal, giving the importance of ornaments
 rason ko abhivyanjana vaachyavishesh se hi hoti he or vaachyavishesh ke pratipadak shabdon se rasadi ke prakaashak alankaar, roopak aadi bhi vaachyavishesh hi hai, atev unhen antarang rasadi hi maananaa chahie
 Outdoorship will only be considered in relation to effortless puns etc
 abhinavgupt ke vichaar se bhi yadhyapi rasaheen kavy main alankaaron kii yojana karnaa shav ko sajaane ke samaan he, tathaapi yadi unka prayog alankaarya sahaayak ke rup main kiya jayega to ve katkavat na rahakar kunkum ke samaan sharir ko sukh or saundarya pradaan karte hue adbhut saundarya se mandit karenge; yahan tak ki ve kaavyatma hi ban jaayenge
 Just as a child playing as a king, considers himself as the king and his companions also think of him, similarly the nutritious ornaments of the juice can also be dominant
 vaaman se pehle ke aacharyon ne alankaar tathaa gunon main bhed nahin mana he
 Bhamah uses the word 'qualities' for "emotional" ornamentation
 dandi donon ke liye "maarg" shabd kaa prayog karte hai or yadi agnipuranakar kavy main anupam shobhaa ke aajaaek ko gun maanate hai to dandi bhi kavy ke shobhaakar dharm ko alankaar kii sangya dete hai
 Vamana is not considered to be a virtuous but ornamental creation of poetry by giving the qualities of qualities to the young woman by her natural beauty, and with her natural qualities, etc
 isi ke pashchaat is prakaar ke vivechan kii parampara prachlit hui
 In the phonology, saying "ananta hea Vagvikalpa:" indicated the imperceptibility of the figures
 dandi ne "te chadyapi vikalpyante" kahkar inaki nity sankhyavriddhi kaa hi nirdesh kiya he
 However, the thinkers have divided the figures into words such as shabdhankar, arthalankar, rasalankar, bhawalankar, mishalankar, bhuyalankar and sanskriti and sankara
 inamen pramukh shabd tathaa arth ke ashrith alankaar hai
 This department is done on the basis of exploration
 jab kisi shabd ke paryaayavachi kaa prayog karne se pankti main dhwani kaa vahi charutv na rahe tab mul shabd ke prayog main shabdalankar hota he or jab shabd ke paryaayavachi ke prayog se bhi arth kii charutha main antar na aata ho tab arthalankar hota he
 After finding the analogy etc
 at the core of the ornaments, the first upsurge divided the total 44 figures into six classes, by subject, but these reveal different tendencies rather than reflecting on the different stages of development of the ornaments
 vaigyanik vargeekaran kii drushti se to rudrat ne hi pehali baar safalataa praapt kii he
 They have really, formally, superfluous and syllable as the basis of their four classes
 vastu ke swaroop kaa varnan vastav he
 There are 23 ornaments covered under this
 kisi vastu ke swaroop kii kisi aprastut se tulana karke spashtaaapurvak use upasthit karne par aupmyamulak 21 alankaar maane jate hai
 In contrast to the rules of Artha and Dharma, there are 12 exaggerated ornaments and 10 ornamental syllables, which denote the same meaning from multiple meanings
 alankaar ke mukhyat: bhed maane jate hai-- shabdalankar, arthalankar tathaa ubhayalankar
 The meaning of the lexicon in the places of word permeation and in words that do not bear the permeability of words, euphemism occurs
 alankaaron kii sthiti do roopen main ho sakati he-- keval rup or mishrit rup
 The biodiversity of the mixture gives rise to "hybrid" and "hybrid" ornaments
 shabdalankaron main anupras, yamak, shlesh tathaa vakrokti kii pramukhataa he
 The number of economies has reached about one hundred twenty five
 sab arthalankaron kii moolbhoot visheshtaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar aacharyon ne inhen mukhyat: paanch virgon main vibhajit kiya he : In poetry, when a famous person or object is equated with a person or object with other similar qualities, then Upma is the deity
 udhaaharan - Exaggeration = Exaggeration + Exaggeration = Exaggerate
 jab kisi baat ko badha chadha kar bataaya jaye, tab atishyokti alankaar hota he
 Examples - jahaan upmey main upmaan kaa aarope kiya jaae vahaan roopak alankaar hota he athwa jahaan gun kii atyant samanta ke kaaran upmey main hi upmaan kaa abhed aarope kar diya jaataa he, vahaan roopak alankaar hota he
 To show the utmost similarity of virtue in metaphorical ornamentation, the subcomponent and subhuman are "integral" meaning "one"
 arthath upmaan ko upmey par aropit kar diya jaataa he
 Examples:- jahaan kaaran ke na hote hue bhi kaary kaa hona paaya jaataa he, vahaan vibhaavna alankaar hota he
 Examples - ek yaa anek varno kii paas paas tathaa krmanusaar aavriti ko anupras alankaar kehete hai 
 Eg; - The flickering rays of charu-chandra ek shabd phir phir pare, jahaan anekanbar 
 The meaning is more, sleep Yamak ornament
 udhaaharan :- 1, to par baron urabasi,sun radhike sujan
 2, Kanak Kanak te hundred times, alcoholic excess
 3, kaali gata kaa ghamand gata This word ornament is used in both meanings
 shlesh alankaar main ek shabd ke do arth nikalate hai
 Like rahim pani rashi, unheard everything without water
 pani gayi na ubarai, moti maanush chun
 
 yahan pani kaa prayog teen baar kiya gaya he, kintu duusari pankti main prayukt pani shabd ke teen arth hai - moti ke sandarbh main pani kaa arth chamak yaa kaanti manushya ke sandarbh main pani kaa arth izzat chooney ke sandarbh main pani kaa arth saadhaaran pani he
 Understanding different meaning other than direct meaning is called curvature decking
 jis sthaan par do saamaanya yaa donon vishesh vaakya main bimb- pratibimb bhav hota he, us sthaan par drushtaant alankaar hota he
 In this ornament, something similar to something that is in the subameral form is in the second sentence in the subhuman form
 udhaaharan Two swords in one sheath, kabhi nahin rah sakati he
 Love women on someone else, pati kaa kya sah sakati he
 In this ornament, it is impossible to have a sheath of two swords as if a husband is observant of two women
 atah yahan bimb-pratibimb bhav drushtigat ho rahaa he

 Vishnu Nagar 1950- Hindi writer gaiyrgaanv, bhikiasain tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Kumarasambhavaam Mahakavi Kalidasa is an epic related to the birth of Virchita Karthikeya, which is counted in the Sanskrit ‘panch Epics’
 yah mahakavy 17 sargon main samaapt hua he, kintu lok dharna he ki keval pratham sarg hi kalidas rachit he
 The other nine cantos of the latter are the creation of another poet
 kuch logon kii dharna he ki kavy aath sargon main hi shivparvati samagam ke saath kumaar ke janm kii purvasuchana ke saath hi samaapt ho jaataa he
 Some say that Kalidasa got leprosy and could not write due to describing Shivparvati's sexual intercourse in the eighth canto
 ek mat yah bhi he ki unka sambhogvarnan janamanas ko ruchi nahin isliye unhone aage nahin likhaa
 The narrative described in it is summarized as follows - parvataraaj himalay ke mainaak naamak putr or gauri naamak kanya hui
 The girl also became famous by the name Parvati and Uma
 jab kanya hui to ek din uske ghar naarad aae or bhavishyavaanee kii ki kanya kaa vivaah shiv se hoga
 Hearing this prediction, the Himalayas were relieved
 udhar shiv himalay ke shikhar par tap kar rahe the
 The Himalayas sent Uma with a friend to take care of her and Uma began to serve Shiva with devotion
 unheen dinon tarakasur se yuddh main devtaa log parajeet ho gaye
 The monster started committing many kinds of tricks
 tab indra sahit saare devtaa brahri ke paas aae
 Demanded a commander worthy of Tarakasura
 tab brahri ne kaha ki shankar ke veery se utpann purush hi tumhaara yogya senapati ho saktaa he
 Therefore, you people should try and be enamored with Shiva Parvati
 yadi shiv ne parvati ko sweekaar kar liya to parvati se jo putr hoga to uske senapati banane par tumhaari vijay hogi
 Thereafter, Indradi gathered to think of a way to remove the deprivation of Lord Shiva
 jab madan us sabha main aae to indra ne unase annurodh kiya ki ve apane mitra vasant ke saath shiv ke tapasya sthaan par jaayan or shiv ko parvati ke prati aasakt karen
 Accordingly, Madan arrived at Shankar's ashram with his wife Rati and friend Vasant
 jab parvati kamalbies kii maala arpan karne shiv ke nikat pahaunchi or shiv ne use lene ke liye haath badhaaya, tab madan ne apane dhanush par mohanastra chadhaaya
 Immediately Shiva's mind was distracted
 shankar ne is prakaar man ke aksmaat vikrut hone kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye chaaron ore drushti daudai
 He saw Madan doing the grooming
 use dekhte hi shiv aag babula ho gaye; unke tritiy netra se agnijvaala prakat hui or madan usamen bhasma ho gaya
 On seeing her husband devouring like this, Rati started mourning and asked Vasant to prepare a pyre and agreed to give up her own life
 tab akashwani hui ki thodaa sabra karo tumhe tumhaara pati punah praapt hoga
 On the other hand, Shiva entered into an obstacle to avoid feminization
 madan ke bhasma hone or shiv ke antardhan ho jane se parvati ne apana sara manorath vifal hote dekha or yah sochakar ki yah rupasaundarya vyarth he, ve shiv ko prasann karne ke liye ek parvat shikhar par ja kar ugr tap karne lagi
 After sometime, Shiva's mind melted, he thought of accepting Parvati
 kintu isse purv unhone parvati kii pariksha karne kaa nishchay kiya or ve ek tapasvi ke ashram main pahunche
 Parvati received him as a guest
 tadantar us tarun tapasvi ne parvati se jigyaasa kii ki kiski prapti ke liye itani ugr tapasya kar rahi ho
 On hearing the question of the guest, Parvati was ashamed and hesitated to express her feelings, then her sakhi spoke of the desire to attain Shiva
 yah sunakar tapasvi veshdhari shiv, shiv ke durgunon or kurupata aadi kaa ullekh kar unki ninda karne lage
 Parvati did not condemn this Shiva and started scolding her
 tab shiv apane swaroop main prakat hue or unka haath pakad liya
 After that Shiva called Saptarshi and sent it to the Himalayas

 Bangladesh's freedom struggle took place in 1971, it is also called 'freedom struggle'

 Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan through this bloody war
 16 disambar san 1971 ko bangladesh bana tha
 This historic victory of India over Pakistan is celebrated as Victory Day
 pakistan par yah jeet kai myanon main aitihaasik thi
 India forced 93,000 Pakistani soldiers to kneel
 1971 ke pehle bangladesh, pakistan kaa ek praant tha jiskaa naam 'purvi pakistan' tha jabaki vartmaan pakistan ko pashchimi pakistan kehete the
 The people of East Pakistan took to the streets in protest against many years of struggle and atrocities of the Pakistan Army and suppression of the Bangladeshi
 1971 main azaadi ke andolan ko kuchalane ke liye pakistani sena ne purvi pakistan ke vidroh par amada logon par jamkar atyaachaar kiye
 Millions of people were killed and countless women were looted
 bharat ne padosi ke naate is julm kaa virodh kiya or krantikariyon kii madad kii
 As a result, there was a direct war between India and Pakistan
 is ladaai main bharat ne pakistan ko ghutane techne par majaboor kar die
 With this, a new country emerged in South Asia
 14 agast 1947 ko dharm par aadhaarit swatantra pakistan desh kaa gathan hua, tatkaaleen pakistan ke do bhaag the purvi evam pashchimi pakistan evam dono hi bhaag me saamaajik, aarthik evam shaikshnik samanthaayen nahi thim| sansadhano ke anusaar purvi pakistan zyada samrudh tha lekin raajnneetik rup se pashchimi pakistan zyada prakhar evam haaavee tha
 Thus the social and economic disparities found in two parts of the same country and the tendency of enlightened people to control the power itself led to nationwide dissatisfaction and finally the formation of Bangladesh in 1971
 pakistan ke gathan ke samay pashchimi kshetra main sindhi, pathan, baloch or mujahiron kii badi sankhya thi, jabaki purv hisse main bengali bolne waalon kaa bahumat tha
 Although there was never a lack of political consciousness in the eastern part, but the eastern part could never get proper representation in the power of the country and always remained politically neglected
 isse purvi pakistan ke logon main jabardast naaraazgi thi
 And to take political advantage of this resentment, Bangladesh leader Sheikh mujib-ur-rehman formed Awami League and demanded more autonomy within Pakistan
 1970 main hue aam chunaav main purvi kshetra main shaikh kii party ne jabardast vijay hasil kii
 His party also won a majority in Parliament but instead of making him Prime Minister, he was put in jail
 or yaheen se pakistan ke vibhaajan kii neenv rakhi gai
 General Yahya Khan was President in Pakistan at the time of 1971 and he gave responsibility to General Tikka Khan to remove the resentment spreading in the eastern part
 lekin unke dwaara dabaav se maamle ko hal karne ke prayaas kiye gayi jisase sthiti puri tarah bighad gai
 On 25 March 1971, there was a massive massacre in this part of Pakistan under the leadership of the army and police
 isse pakistani sena main kaam kar rahe purvi kshetra ke nivaasiyon main jabardast rosh hua or unhone alag mukti vahini bana lee
 The Pakistani military continued to persecute innocent, weaponless people
 jisase logon kaa palaayan aarambh ho gaya jiske kaaran bharat ne antarrashtriya samudaay se lagaataar apil kii ki purvi pakistan kii sthiti sudhari jaae, lekin kisi desh ne dhyaan nahin diya or jab vahaan ke visthapit lagaataar bharat aate rahe to april 1971 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne mukti vahini ko samarthan dekar, bangladesh ko aaazaad karwaane kaa nirnay liya
 Before becoming Bangladesh, the Pakistani military in East Pakistan violated human rights with the help of local leaders and religious extremists
 25 march 1971 ko shuru hue oparation search lite se lekar puure bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan purvi pakistan main jamkar hinsa hui
 According to the Bangladesh government, around 3 million people died during this period
 haalanki, pakistan sarkaar kii ore se gathit kiye gaye hamudur rahamaan ayog ne is dauraan sirf 26 hajaar aam logon kii maut kaa nateeja nikaala
 At the behest of the Pakistan Army, the Razakars, Al Shams and Al Badr tortured Bengali-speaking minorities and Bengali-speaking Muslims in erstwhile East Pakistan and fiercely violated human rights
 unke dwaara kiye gayi amanviya atyaachaar ke pramaan aaj tak bangladesh me samuhik kabron ke rup me milte rahe hai | After the massacres in erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971, several mass graves have been built, which have been known till date
 1999 main dhaka main masjid ke paas ek vishaal kabr kaa pataa chalaa
 The atrocities against the Bengalis can be traced to a telegram sent from the US Consulate in Dhaka
 is telegram ke mutabik bengaaliyon ke khilaaf yuddh kii pehali hi raat ko dhaka uniwarsity main chaatro or aam logon ko saream maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Massacres were carried out in all the areas from where opposition was feared
 Even people were taken out of the houses and fryed with bullets
 1971 main purvi pakistan main lakhon mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar, atyaachaar kiya gaya or hatya kii gayi
 According to an estimate, such excesses were made with about four lakh such women, who committed acts of forced sexual relations with them, women in military cant as sex workers etc
 and acts like gang rape
 563 bengali mahilaon ko kaint ilaake main kar rakhaa tha kaidaladai ke pehle hi din se 563 bengali mahilaon ko dhaka ke dingi military kaint main kaid kar diya gaya tha
 Pakistani army soldiers used to commit excesses with these women

 The entry of these refugees into India and the economic pressure on India due to this weight is also considered to be a reason behind interfering in this battle of India
 bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan mukti vahini kaa gathan pakistan sena ke atyaachaar ke virodh main kiya gaya tha
 In 1969, discontent grew in East Pakistan against Pakistan's then military ruler General Ayub and was at its peak in 1970 during the movement of Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
 mukti vahini ek chhapamar sanghathan tha, jo pakistani sena ke khilaaf gorilla yuddh lard rahaa tha
 Mukti Vahini was supported by the Indian Army
 bangladesh ke sansthaapak netaa shaikh mujeeb-ur-rahamaan ne bangladesh kii azaadi ke liye sangharsh kiya

 The basis of life
 The meaning of existence, the pursuit of concrete meaning in personal existence
 This frustration can also result in neurosis

 Frankel dies They raise a very big question through the suffering of people, which has become the cause of everyone's weakness in today's life, that is the migration of meaninglessness in life
 Such suffering is seen mostly in those who escaped from the death camp
 There was no eagerness to live
 There was hollowness in their mind because they go through internal loneliness

 Frankel says that the real meaning of life is its own Not in the psyche but in the world
 In the same way, the real purpose of human existence is not through self-introduction
 Its essence comes from self-excellence
 Frankel Number thing that self-introduction arguments bring it to perfect justice could ever become the basis of life, as human as will try to get him as he lost i sansar ko swayan ki abhivyakti kabhi nahin samajhnaa chahie, naa hi sansar ko ek maatr saadhan yaah aatm parichay ko praapt karne kaa upaychiisse yahi aashay spasht hota hai ki jivan kaa arth sthir nahin he, par iskaa koi chor bhi nahin handi logotherapy ke antargat ham jivan ke arth teen tareeke se dhund sakate hai: karm ke madhyam se; kisi ke yaah kisi vaastu ke mulya ko anubhav karke; pidaa sekhi pehle tareeke ko purna karnaa atyant laabhadaayak haii dusre or tisare tareeko main punah vistaar ki aavashyaktaa handidusraa tarika jisase jivan main arth kaa pravesh hota hai wo anubhavon se hi praapt hota hai, yah shiksha hamen prakruti se ho sakati hai yaa phir samskruti se yaa phir kisi ko anubhav karke bhi yani prem ke dwarai prem hi vah ek dhaal hai jisase manushya ke antaratmik vyaktitv ko sinchaa ja saktaa handi koi bhi kisi manushya ko tab tak nahin jaan saktaa yaa samaj saktaa jab tak prem bhav ki utpatti nahin hotiji prem ko aadhyatmik rup ke anusaar agar daalaa jaae to usase vah dusre manushya ke mahatvapurn lakshan ko dekh saktaa hai, vahi manushya jisase vah prem karata hoi isse bhi adhik vah apane samarthy ki pushti ho jaati he jo aatm parichay ke raah par bahut bada kadam haii isse donon vyakti apane samarthy ko pahchaan jate handi The third way that helps a man discover the meaning of his life is suffering
 Whenever a man is helpless or goes through a situation that does not result in his hand such as: an incurable disease, then a person realizes his identity
 There is a lot of opportunity to do it, that is, you have the opportunity to get the biggest meaning of life by facing the pain
 In this, the attitude of the person towards the suffering is also strong to withstand the suffering

 aadhyatmikta, murtipuja shabd ke samaan hi kai alag manyataon or paddatiyon ke liye prayukt shabd he, yadhyapi yah un logon ke saath vishwaason ko saajha nahin karti he jo murtipujak hai athwa anivarytah aatma ke astitv main vishwaas yaa avishvaas se nirmit nahin he
 a common definition of spirituality may be that it is an approach to the realization of divine stimulation, which is different from religion
 aadhyatmikta ko, aisi paristhitiyon main aksar dharm kii avadharana ke virodh main rakhaa jaataa he, jahaan dharm ko samhitabaddh, pramanik, kathor, damankaaree, yaa sthir ke rup main grahan kiya jaataa he, jabaki aadhyatm ek virdohi swar he, jo aam bolchaal kii bhashaa main swayan avishkrut prathaon yaa vishwaason ko darshata he, athwa un prathaon or vishwaason ko, jinhen bina kisi aupchaarik nirdesan ke viksit kiya gaya he
 It is mentioned as an access to a non-material reality; An internal path that enables a person to discover the essence of his existence; Or "the deepest values and meanings with which people live
" " aadhyatmik vyavhaar, jisamen dhyaan, prarthana or chintan shaamil hai, ek vyakti ke aatanrik jivan ke vikaas ke liye abhipret he; aise vyavhaar aksar ek brihad satya se judane kii anubhuti main falit hoti he, jisase anya vyaktiyon yaa maanav samudaay ke saath jude ek vyapak swa kii utpatti hoti he; prakruti yaa brahmad ke saath; yaa divine prabhutaa ke saath
 aadhyatmikta ko jivan main aksar prerana athwa dishanirdesh ke ek strot ke rup main anubhav kiya jaataa he
 In this, immaterial realities may include belief or experience of the soul or the undetectable nature of the world
 paramparaagat rup se, dharmon ne aadhyatmikta ko dharmik anubhav ke ek abhinn pahalu ke rup main mana he
 Many still associate spirituality with religion, but the decline in membership of organized religions and the development of secularism in the Western world has led to a broader view of spirituality
 dharmanirpeksh aadhyatmikta kaa sanketarth aise vyakti se hota he jiskaa aadhyatmik drushtikon adhik vyaktigat, sanrachit kam, nae vichaaron / prabhaavon ke prati adhik khulaa or sangathit dharmon kii saidhantik aasthaaon kii apeksha adhik bahulwaadi hota he
 Some of the atheists in such a wide range are also considered spiritual
 jabaki naastikta kaa jhukaav, parloukik daavon or ek vaastavik "aatma" ke astitv ke maamle main andeh bharaa hota he, kuch naastik, "aadhyatm" ko vichaaron, bhaawanaaon or shabdon ke poshan ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jo is vishwaas ke saath taal-mail rakhata he ki kisi na kisi prakaar se yah sampoorn brahmad juda hua he; bhale hi yah prayek paimaane par kaary-kaaran ke rahasyamay pravaah ke dwaara hi kyon na ho
 The trend of 'modern-day', by contrast, sees spirituality as an active engagement with a force / power / energy / emotion that facilitates a deep self-feeling
 kuch logon ke liye, aadhyatmikta main, dhyaan, prarthana or chintan jaise abhyaason ke madhyam se kisi vyakti ke aantarik jivan kaa aatmanirikshan or vikaas shaamil hota he
 Some modern religions see spirituality in everything: see pantheism and neo-pantheism
 In a similar fashion, Religious Naturalism has a spiritual outlook towards the awe, glory and mystery seen in the natural world
 ek isai ke liye, khud ko "dharmik se adhik aadhyatmik" ke rup main sanderbhit karne kaa taatpary, bhagwaan ke saath ek antarang sambandh pasand karne ke tahat niyamon, rivaazon or paramparaon kaa pratwaad ho saktaa he 
 is vishwaas kaa aadhaar yah he ki yishu messiah, maanav jati ko unheen niyamon, rivaazon or paramparaon se mukt karne aae the, jisase maanav jati "aatma kii raah par chalane" main sakasham ho or is prakaar parameshwar ke saath ek aise sidhe sambandh dwaara "isai" jivan style banaae rakh sake
 Spirituality in a wide variety of cultural and religious concepts is often seen as embracing a spiritual path on which a person walks to achieve a certain goal, such as a higher level of awareness, deeper knowledge, or God With or with creation
 Plato's Allegory of the Kew, presented in Book VII of The Republic, describes a similar journey, as written by Teresa of Avila
 aadhyatmik yatra ek maarg he jiske aayam mukhya rup se vyaktiparak or vyaktigat hai
 a spiritual path can be considered a short-term path specified toward a specific goal, or life-span
 jivan kii har ghatana is yatra kaa hissaa he, lekin vishesh rup se ek vyakti mahatvapurn kshanon yaa nirnaayak maukon ko shaamil kar saktaa he, jaise ki vibhinn aadhyatmik vishyon kaa abhyaas, us vyakti ke saath tulana jise gahan aadhyatmik anubhav vaala mana jaataa he, pavitra granthon ke prati vyaktigat drushtikon, aadi
 If the spiritual path is completely or partially the same with an initiation path, then real evidence has to be achieved
 aam taur par ek saamaajik mahatv se pehle is tarah ke pareekshan, ek vyakti ke liye uske ek nishchit str tak pahunchane kii "pariksha" he
 Spirituality is also described as a two-step process: first on internal development and second, on the manifestation of this result in the everyday world
 yadhyapi, donon hi shabd, aadhyatmikta or dharm, aseem yaa ishwar kii khoj ko sanderbhit kar sakate hai, logon kii ek badhati sankhya in donon ko bhinn arthon main dekhati he, jahaan aadhyatmikta kii anubhuti ke margon main dharm keval ek maarg he
 Cultural historian and yogi William Irwin Thompson states, "religion is not the same as spirituality; rather spirituality takes the form of religion in civilization
 " Those who speak of spirituality outside of religion often define themselves as "spiritual, but not religious" and generally believe in the existence of many different "spiritual paths" - and for spirituality Emphasize the importance of finding one's own personal path
 ek surveykshan ke mutabik, america kii kareeb 24±4% jansankhya, khud ko aadhyatmik, par dharmik nahin ke rup main paribhaashit karti he
 It can then be said that the important difference is that religion is a type of formal external search, while spirituality is defined as searching within oneself
 'aadhyatmikta' kaa anubhav; unke ucchtam mulyon kii pratikriya main, yaa prakruti athwa brahmad ko dekhte yaa adhyayan karte samay, vismay, aashcharya or shraddha kii maanviya bhavanaaen bhi dharmanirpeksh / vaigyanik kaaryakshetra hai
 Many authors have suggested that quantum physics has spiritual consequences
 udhaaharan hai bhautik vigyaani-darshanik fritjof kapra; ken wilbar, jinhone ek "intigral thiari of konshasness" prastaavit kiya; saidhantik parmaanu bhautik vigyaani amit goswami, jo padaarth nahin, balki ek saarvbhaumik chetana ko saare astitv kaa muladhar maanate hai ; ervin laszlo, jinhone moulik urja or gyaanaprad kshetra ke rup main "kwantum vaikum" kii avadharana pesh kii, jo na keval vartmaan brahmad, balki ateet or maujuuda sabhi brahmandon ko paribhaashit karata he
 Prayer has caught the attention of behavioral scientists while maintaining a general increase in spirituality and interest in complementary and alternative therapies
 masters or spilmons ne duurastha nivedak prarthana ke prabhaavon kaa tatva-vishleshan kiya, lekin unhen kisi spasht prabhaav kaa pataa nahin chalaa
 Spirituality has played a central role in self-help movements such as the Alcoholics Anonymus: "


 if an alcoholic fails to complete and expand his spiritual life through karma and self-sacrifice for other people, he will be forthcoming
" Will not be able to escape certain crises and dull moments



 " agar aadhyatmikta ko aatanrik shanti yaa sukh ke aadhaar kii khoj ke rup main samajha jaataa he, to vyaktigat kalyaan ke liye kisi tarah kaa aadhyatmik abhyaas aavashyak he
 This activity may or may not involve belief in the hereafter
 If a person has such a belief and feels that the connection with such a supernatural existence is the basis of happiness, then spiritual practice will be followed on the same basis: even if there is no such belief in the person, even then thoughts and feelings Spiritual practices are necessary for management and understanding that would otherwise hinder happiness

 If consciousness exists beyond the body, including the brain, then a person is not only connected to the physical world but also to a non-temporal world

 Critics such as Williams denounce metaphysics as pseudo-scientific and oppose ideas and beliefs that include supernatural powers and which nevertheless refer to the imperfection of metaphysical concepts and the scientific character, citing the subjective qualities of spiritual experiences has been submitted

 Spirituality can be explored not only through traditional organized religions, but also through movements such as feminist theology and ecological spirituality
 Spirituality is associated with mental health, substance abuse management, marital life, childbearing and coping
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki aadhyatmikta, jivan main arth or uddeshy kii khoj kii ore le jaati he

 Under these circumstances, anthropologists take so-called "spiritual" practices such as Shamanism in a generally religious context and even non-traditional activities such as Robespierre's Cult of the Supreme Being within the purview of religion

 The spread of ideas of modernism began to reduce the role of religion in society and popular thought

 In 1882, in the wake of Nietzsche's concept of "the death of God", people dissatisfied with scientific rationalism increasingly tended to the idea of spirituality as an alternative to materialism and traditional religious dogma

 The distinction between religious and spiritual became more common in the popular mind with the rise of secularism in the late 20th century and the advent of the New Age movement
