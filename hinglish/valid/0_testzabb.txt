 galileo gallily italy ke vaigyanik the
 He was a great inventor and had incomparable support in the development of visionaries
 is mahaan vichaarak kaa janm aadhunik italy ke pisa naamak shahar main ek sangitajna parivaar main hua tha
 The city of Pisa, modern Italy, had historically blamed the birth of the great scientist Galileo Galilei on 15 February 1564 as a flaw in the creation of God
 galileo ke dwaara pratipaadit sindvanto se dharmik manyataon kaa khandan hota tha jiske liye galileo ko ishwariya manyataon se chhedchhad karne ke liye sari umr karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 His father Vincenzo Galilei was a well-known music expert of the time
 ve "lut" naamak vaadya yantra bajaate the, yahi lut naamak yantra baad main guitar or benzo ke rup main viksit hua
 During his musical composition, Vincenzo Galilei intimately studied the tension of the stringed string or the string and the tones emanating from it, and found that there is a connection between the tension of the string and the string
 pita ke dwaara sangeet ke liye tani huyi dori yaa taar se nikalne vaali dhvaniyon ke antarasambandhon ke parinaamon kaa vaigyanik adhyayan unke putr galileo dwaara kiya gaya
 During the course of this study, the child Galileo was inspired to assimilate his results by doing a thorough experiment in his mind
 inako pariksha mulak vigyaan kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He gave the oscillation formula
 inhone doorabeen kaa avishkaar kiya
 He made the visionary device more advanced
 uski sahaayta se anek khagoleey prekshan liye tathaa copernicus ke siddhanth kaa samarthan kiya
 He is considered the father of modern experimental astronomy
 unhone paaya ki prakruti ke niyam ek duusare karkon se prabhavit hote hai or kisi ek ke badhane or ghatane ke bich ganit ke samikarnon jaise hi sambandh hote he
 That is why he said: - 'the language of God is mathematics
 ‘is mahaan ganitagya or vaigyanik ne hi prakaash kii gati ko naapane kaa saahas kiya
 For this, Galileo and one of his assistants sat on two mountain peaks located several miles away in the dark night
 jahaan se galileo ne laalaten jalaakar rakhi, apane sahaayak kaa sanket paane ke baad unhen laalaten or uske khatke ke madhyam se prakaash kaa sanket dena tha
 His assistant on the second hill had to see the light of the lantern and remove the sign of the second lantern kept near him
 is prakaar duusari pahaad kii chotii par chamakate prakaash ko dekhakar galileo ko prakaash kii gati kaa akalan karnaa tha
 Thus, the results that Galileo achieved were not real to a large extent, but the frequency and success of the experiments, the failure to achieve the desired results only after the failure was unique
 kaalaantar main prakaash kii gati or urja ke sambandhon kii jatil gulthi ko sulajhane vaale mahaan vaigyanik albert ainstin ne isi kaaran unhen ‘aadhunik vigyaan kaa pita ‘ ke naam se sambodhit kiya
 Galileo was religious but wanted to sidestep the old religious beliefs through rationality and experimentation
 varsh 1609 main galileo ko ek aisi doorabeen kaa pataa chalaa jiskaa avishkaar holland main hua tha, is doorabeen kii sahaayta se duurastha khagoleey pindon ko dekh kar unki gati kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa tha
 Galileo himself heard this and built a telescope that was more powerful than the indiscriminate telescope in Holland
 iske aadhaar par apane prekshan tathaa prayogon ke madhyam se galileo ne yah paaya ki purv main vyaapt manyataon ke vipareet brihamand main sthit prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he
 Earlier, Copernicus also said that all the planets including the Earth revolve around the Sun, for which they had to be angry with the Church
 ab prayog ar vivek par aadhaarit parinaamon ke aadhaar par galiliye ne bhi yahi hona sidv paaya
 Till that time, it was universally accepted that the Earth is located in the center of the universe and all the celestial bodies including the sun and the moon revolve around the earth continuously
 is manyata ko tadsamay ke dharmacharyon kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Due to the results obtained on the basis of his experiments, Galileo decided to stand against the old concepts
 jab galileo ne yah sidwant saarvajanik kiya to carch ne ise apni avagya mana or is avagya ke liye galileo ko carch kii ore se karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 The idea given by Galileo forced the new man to accept a new form of direction of contemplation
 saamaajik or dharmik pratadna ke chalate purv se vyaapt manyataon or vishwaason ke vipareet pratipaadit sindvanto ke saath ve adhik din tak khadey nahin rah sake
 In 1633, 69-year-old Old Galileo was ordered by the Church to publicly apologize, saying that his doctrine against religious beliefs was the biggest mistake of his life for which he is ashamed
 unhone aisa hi kiya parantu iske baad bhi unhen karawas main daal diya gaya
 His health continued to deteriorate and due to this, the sentence of imprisonment was changed to house-imprisonment i
e
 imprisonment in his own house
 apane jivan kaa aakhri din bhi unhone isi kaid main hi bitaayaa
 The supreme institution of Christianity, always under the supervision of the Pope, in Vatican City, admitted in 1992 that he had made a mistake in deciding Galileo's case
 is prakaar ek mahaan khagol vigyaani, ganitagya, bhautikavid evam darshanik galileo ke sambandh main 1633 main jari aadesh kar apni aitihaasik bhul sweekaar karne main carch ko saade teen sau saalon se bhi adhik kaa samay laga
 Four hundred years after the creation of binoculars and the observation of celestial bodies in the year 1609, the year 400 was celebrated as the International Year of Astronomy as the 400th birth anniversary and paid tribute to this great scientist and tried to make a mistake

 saundaryashastra samvednaatmak-bhaavnaatmak gun-dharm or mulyon kaa adhyayan he
 Aesthetics is the representation of art, culture and nature
 saundaryashastra, darshanashastra kaa ek ang he
 It is also called Soundaryamimansa and Anandamimansa
 soundaryashastra vah shaastra he jisamen kalatmak kritiyon, rachanaaon aadi se abhivyakt hone vaala athwa unamem nihit rahane vaale saundarya kaa tathvik, darshanik or maarmik vivechan hota he
 The main purpose of this is to discuss the nature and nature of the joyful feeling in our mind by looking at a beautiful object and to coordinate it with other sensations of life
 saundaryashastra darshan kii ek shakha he jiske tahat kala, sahitya or sundarata se sambandhit prashnon kaa vivechan kiya jaataa he
 There is a word in the Greek language 'esthetico' which implies the derivation of 'esthetics', for the sense that is received by sense perception apart from the realm of knowledge
 prakruti, kala or sahitya se sambandhit clasical saundaryashastreey drushtikon viksit hua
 This approach keeps the political and contextual dimensions of the work out of the scope of the work, keeping its concern only with the beauty and art form
 lekin kala or sahitya vivechna kii kuch aisi vidhiyaan bhi hai jo kritiyon ke taatpary or unki rachana-prakriya ke saamaajik or aitihaasik pahaluon se samvaad sthapit karti hai
 Marxist aesthetics is one such discourse
 pracheen unani darshan main plato kii rachana hippiaz major main saundarya kii avadharana par charchaa milti he
 Aristotle's thoughts on the sad style of play in his poetics have influenced art-criticism for a long time
 kala or saundarya par hue gair-pashchimi pracheen chintan ke sandarbh main bharat ke naatyashaastra, abhinavgupt ke ras-siddhant or chini vidwaan cheng yin-yuvan kii rachana lee-tai ming-hua chi dwaara prastut anuthe or vistrut vimarshon kaa loha pashchimi jagat main bhi mana jaataa he
 non-western standards for interpreting this tradition of art-practice have not yet been formed, and interpretations made through Western standards have yielded unsatisfactory results
 pashchimi vichaar-jagat main ek darshanik gatividhi ke taur par saundaryashastra kii pruthak sankalpana attharahavin sadi main ubhari jab kala-kritiyon kaa anushilan hast-shilp se alag karke kiya jane laga
 This resulted in the formulation of the concept of fine arts by theorists
 alexander gottaleeb bomgaarten ne 1750 main esthetica likh kar ek bahes kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Seven years later, the emerging discourse of aesthetics was questioned by David Hume writing 'of the Standard of Tests'
 lekin aadhunik europee saundaryashastreey vimarsh kii vaastavik shuruyaat emanuel kaant kii 1790 main prakashit rachana 'critic of jajment' se hui
 In this work, Kant insisted on universalizing the criterion of aesthetics
 lekin duusari ore ve kisi bhi tarah ke saarvbhaum saundaryashastra kii sambhaavna par andeh karte hue bhi nazar aaye
 Despite this contradiction, Kant's achievement was that he established some essential dialects to explore art and beauty
 in dvibhajanon main sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai : indriyabodh or tark-buddhi, sarawastu or rup, abhivyakti or abhivyakt, anand or upsanhaar, swatantraaa or aavashyaktaa aadi
 Kant's second achievement was that he distinguished between aesthetic experience and aesthetic experience
 unka kahana tha ki saundaryashastreey vyakhya or uski nishpatti vishleshan ke lakshya ke prati bina kisi vyaavhaarik aasakti ke hi kii jaani chahie
 The nineteenth century can be said to be a century of aesthetics
 kaant kii banaayi gayi zamin par hi baad main german vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kaa vrihattar darshanik dhaanchaa khadaa kiya
 Hegel in his works Lectures on Esthetics, Schopenhaur in The World as Will and Representation and Nietzsche in Fine Births of Tragedy gave various interpretations of various aspects of Western aesthetics and published new dimensions
 unnisvin sadi ke aakiri daur main angrezi bhashi saundaryashastra main rupvaad kaa ubhaar hua
 Victorian Britain gave the slogan 'for the art of art', among whose spokespersons Oscar Wilde's name is notable
 vishuddh saundaryashastreey anubhav par bal dene vaale rupavaadi drushtikon ne lagbhag sabhi kshetron main aadhunik kala-roopon ko gaharaai se prabhavit kiya
 But the sounds of opposition to this movement were made by the great Russian litterateur Leo Tolstoy, What is Art? And narrated the work of John Dewey, the leading spokesman for American consequentialism, in Art as Experience
 tolstoy kaa tark tha ki jo kala manushyon ke bich naitik anubhutiyon kaa sampreshan nahin kar sakati, vah rupavaadi kasautiyon ke hisaab se kitni bhi mahaan kyon na ho, uski saraahna nahin kii ja sakati
 Divi also protested against art being cut from the structures of experience outside the realm of aesthetics in the name of aesthetics, taking ironics from the question of the role of communication
 saundaryashastreey chintan kii german parampara beesvin sadi main bhi jari rahi
 Aesthetic theories were further enriched using tools of phenomenology, hermeneutics and Marxism
 1936 main martin haidagar ne ‘da orijan of da work of art’ jaisaa niabandh likhaa jise kala ke darshan kii sarvshereshth rachanaaon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Heidegger claimed in this essay that viewing art work as an object in this world is one of the fundamental semiotic errors of modernity
 hidagar ke mutabik kala to ek naye jagat ke dwaar kholti he, kala ke rup main satya apane-aap main ghatata hi nahin hamaare apane anubhav ke daayre main vastuon ke astitv kaa udghaatan bhi karata he
 In this way, through aesthetics, Heidegger criticized modernity and took on traditional existential epistemology and technological interpretation of things
 beesvin sadi ke madhya tak saundaryashastra kii upyogita par sawaal uthne lage
 In some of his lectures given at the beginning of the century, Edward Bulow had asked the question whether the definitions of art and beauty were eroding the creation-ability of the artist
 ye vyaakhyaan 1957 main chape or saath ke dashak main america kalakaar barnet newman ne elaan kar diya ki saundaryashastra kaa upyog kala ke liye vahi he jo pakshishastra kaa pakshiyon ke liye hai
 That is, an artist ignorant of aesthetics is good
 samskruti-adhyayan ke tahat saundaryashastra ke abhijanonmukh rujhaanon kii kadi pariksha kii gayi he
 Pierre Bordeaux not only identified the ideological underpinnings of art under the sociology of culture, but also stated that aesthetics has not been able to establish its own cultural and political roots
 bordiyo ke is vichaar kaa pratwaad adorno kii rachana esthetic thiyari main miltaa he
 Adorno cites the example of twentieth-century non-standard art, saying that art still has the potential to counter ideology
 adorno ke mutabik kala apane samaaj kii upaj zarur hoti he, par uskaa rachana- prakriya main saamaajik niyatatvavaad se swytt kshan bhi nihit hota he
 Therefore, it also gives the artist and his audience or reader an opportunity to think in ways other than those used by the then dominant culture
 kuch marxvaadi vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kii ek marxvaadi shrenee viksit karne kii koshish bhi kii he
 In view of such efforts from a critical point of view, the leading Marxist literary critic Namwar Singh of Hindi has considered the first example of this as the creation of 'socialist Realism' in the Soviet Union
 unhone kaha he, ‘shaastra banate hi saamaajik yatharth bhi sutarabaddh ho gaya or us yatharth ko abhivyakt karne kii style bhi
 a new formalism got under way, both in composition and in criticism
 jis desh ne samaajawaadee kranti kii, vah sahitya or kala ke kshetra main koi kranti karne se thithak gaya
 Such an insult to reality was not even in the literature before the revolution, and not even in the literature of the nineteenth century Europe when the Bourgeois Revolution gave rise to realism
 haalat bahut kuch hindi kii ritivaadee kahi janevaali sahitya-pravriti kii- si ho gayi, jab alankarishastra ke lakshan granthon ko saamne rakh kar kavitaayen likhi ja rahi thim
 ' namvar singh ne doosraa udhaaharan jorge lukach dwaara rachit saundaryashastra naamak vishaal granth kaa diya he
 He describes it as a monumental attempt by Lukach to finally compile his nearly sixty years of long literature into an orderly scripture, 'this huge text of thousands of pages is still available in the German language and which the Germans would know well, He will be able to say something confident about it
 angrezi main abhi tak uske bare main jo kuch kaha gaya he or uske chhitput anshon se jo abhas mila he uske aadhaar par itnaa to kaha hi ja saktaa he ki isamen samast kalaon ko ‘anukaran’ main nisshesh karne kii asafal cheshtaa kii gayi he
 In this way, when the Marxist Lukach goes on tying all the arts into one scripture, he is ultimately forced to go to Aristotle
 kisi angrezi saptahik ne is granth kii samiksha ke saath ek aisa cartoon chapa tha, jisamen lukach marks kii dadhi ke saath arestu kii shakl- surat or poshaak main pesh aate hai
 Namvar Singh believes that Lukach's parable reveals a weak aspect of this long tradition of Marxist aesthetics
 ve kehete hai ki ‘aksar vah swayan ‘kala’ naamak sanstha ko chunauti dene main chook gaya or kala kii clasiki paribhaasha ko sweekaar kar lene main use koi haani nahin dikhaai padi
 Once these definitions are accepted in the basic form, then with some manipulation, the work of evaluating this poet or work remains; And needless to say that Marxist aesthetics have demonstrated their talent in this field - competing with the biggest thinkers of high culture
 vyakhya or moolyankan kii bhashaa nishchay hi bhautikwaadi bhi he or aitihaasik bhi, lekin kul milakar vah prabhutvshaalee parampara se bahut alag nahin he

 The bull was very beautiful, it was white and had only one leg
 gaay bhi kamdhenu ke samaan sundar thi
 Both were shivering in fear

 katipay vidwaan swabhaav ko or katipay ishwar ko bhi dukh kaa kaaran maanate hai
 So, o Rajan! Now you decide who is the cause of the misery
 " On hearing the words of the bull, the Emperor Parikshit said - "O Taurus! You are definitely a religion in the form of a bull and this cow god is Prithvi Mata
 aap dharm ke marm ko bhalee-bhanti jaanate hai
 You can not cheat anyone, that is why you are not giving the name of the person who is suffering

 The evil sinful Shudra kings will enjoy this beautiful land due to Lord Srikrishna Chandra's own movement, that is why this mother is also sad
 " Saying so, King Parikshit took out his sharp-edged sword to kill that sinful Shudra royalty Kali Yuga
 kaliyug ne bhaybheet hokar apane rajasi vesh ko utaar kar raja parakshit ke charnon main gir gaya or traahi-traahi kehane laga
 King Parikshit was a great refugee Vatsal, he did not think it appropriate to kill the Kaliyuga who came in the shelter and said to the Kaliyuga - "O Kaliyuga! You have come to my shelter, so i gave you my life
 kintu adharm, paap, jhooth, chori, kapat, daridrata aadi anek updravon kaa mul kaaran keval tu hi he
 Therefore, leave my kingdom immediately and do not come back again
 " Hearing these words of King Parikshit, Kali Yuga said in a Katar voice - "O Rajan! Your kingdom is on the whole earth, there is no place outside my kingdom where i can reside
 he bhupati! aap bade dayaalu hai, aapane mujhe sharan diya he
 Now you have to manage some kind of my residence with mercy
 " When Kali Yuga said this, King Parikshit got into thinking
 phir vichaar kar ke unhone kaha - "he kaliyug! dyut, madhpan, parastrigaman or hinsa in chaar sthanon main asaty, mad, kaam or krodh kaa nivas hota he
 i allow you to live in these four places
 " is par kaliyug bolaa - "he uttaranandan! ye chaar sthaan mere nivas ke liye aparyaapt hai
 Please give me some other place of mercy
 " kaliyug ke is prakaar maangane par raja parakshit ne use paanchava sthaan 'swarna' diya
 Kali Yuga went away from there after meeting these places, but after going some distance, he came back in an invisible form and resided in the golden crown of King Parikshit

 Losing weary in the evening, he reached the ashram of Shamik Rishi and at that time the sage was absorbed in the Brahmin Samaghi
 
 Parikshit said that we are thirsty we need water, there is no one here, are you listening, we are talking about the king, we are thirsty, we need water, you do not hear whether the sage was a Brahmin in the tomb at that time
 - Three times asked for water but the sage's house was not broken
 
 Kaliyuga sitting in Rajmukut got inspired by his true wisdom and decided to punish the sage
 parantu raja ke achche sanskaro ke kaaran unhonen apane-aap ko us paap se roak liya

 Top Quark was last discovered in 1995 on Fermilab
 quark moolbhoot kan main se ek he, jisase padaarth banataa he
 Protons and neutrons are made up of these basic particles
 quark ko unke flavor se janaa jaataa he or yah chh: prakaar ke hote hai:-ap quark, charm quark, taap quark, down quark, strinj quark or batom quark
 The symbols for these are u, c, t, d, s and b respectively
 pehle teen prakaar ke quark ap-tip quark tathaa shesh down-tip quark kehalaate hai
 The mass of the up and down quarks is the lowest of all quarks
 baari dravyaman vaale quark, dravyaman ke kshay ke kaaran teji se ap va down quark main parivartit hote hai, kyonki ap va down quark saadharantaya sthaayee hote hai or brahmand main sabase adhik paye jate hai
 Antimatter of quark is called {anti partical} anti-quark, each type of quark has antimatter, which is called anti-up quark xxrep 4 - anti-bottom quark respectively
 quark akele nahin paye jate, varan hamensha samooh main paye jate he
 The components consisting of quarks are called hadrons
 teen quark ke sanyonjan se beryon {baryons}, teen anti-quark ke sangyojan se anti-beryon tathaa ek quark evam ek anti-quark ke sangyojan se meson banate he
 Protons are formed by combining two up quarks and one down quark, and neutrons are formed by combining one up quark and two down quarks
 beryaan, mesaan, proton, neutron, newclian {ek proton + ek neutron} or parmaanu nabhik, yah sabhi hedron kehalaate he kyonki sabhi quark se milakar bane hote he
 The statistical behavior of quarks is fermion
 quark main kai prakaar ke gun hote he, jaise vidyut aavesh, rang aavesh, bhrami yaa prachakran {spin} or dravyaman
 All these properties are also found in antimatter, but are opposite
 ap-tip quark kaa vidyut aavesh +2 / 3 or down-tip quark kaa -1 / 3 hota he
 The antagonism of their antagonism is -2 / 3 and +1 / 3 respectively
 quark ke sangyojan se banane vaale kano kaa vidyut aavesh, usamen paye jane vaale quarko ke kul vidyut aavesho ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 For example, the electric charge of a proton is equal to the sum of the electric charges of two up-quarks and one down-quark, that is, 1
 isi tarah neutron kaa vidyut aavesh shunya hota he
 Main article: weak interaction kan bhautikee kii chaar moolbhoot antahkriya on main se ek, keval durbal antahkriya ke madhyam se ek flavor kaa quark kisi anya flavor ke quark main tabdeel ho saktaa he
 By absorbing or emitting a w boson, one can convert any up-type quark to any down-type quark and vice versa
 yah flavor parivartan tantra beta kshay kii radiodharmee prakriya kaa kaaran banataa he, jisamen ek neutron kaa ek proton, ek electron or ek electron antinutrino main "vibhaajan" ho jaataa he 
 This occurs when a virtual W− of a down quark in a neutron decays into an up quark by a boson emitter and turns the neutron into a proton
 W− boson phir ek electron or ek electron antinutrino main tut jaataa he
 According to quantum chromodynamics, quarks possess properties called innate color charge
 teen tarah ke rang aavesh hote he- haraa, laal, or nila
 Similarly, there are three charges per color - magenta, cyan and yellow
 har quark ek rang vahan karte he, jabaki prayek antiquark prati rang vahan karte he
 Color charges occur only in quarks and gluons
 dhyaan rahe, rang aavesh kaa drishy prakaash ke rang varnakram se koi sambandh nahin he
 The system of attraction and repulsion between charges of quarks with different combinations of three colors is called a strong interaction, mediated by a force carrier particle called a gluon; It is discussed in detail below
 vah siddhant jo prabal antahkriyaaon ko bataata he kwantum chromodynamiks kehalaata he
 a quark, which will have a single color value, can form a bound system with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor
 The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ξ plus an antiquark with color charge −ξ will result in a color charge of 0 and the formation of a meson
 This is analogous to the additive color model in basic optics
 Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same "white" color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon
 quark kii bhrami yaa prachakran 1 / 2 hoti he

 In cases where angioedema grows too fast, it should be treated as emergency therapy because in such cases the airway may be obstructed and the patient may suffocate
 jab vaahikshof kaa kaaran allergy ho, tab epinephrine jivan rakshak kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 In the case of hereditary angioedema, epinephrine does not prove to be more helpful in treatment
 aisa paaya gaya he ki yah allergy ke alawa dawaaon ke parshv prabhaav ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, aisa vishesh rup se isii sandamak ke prabhaav main dekha jaataa he
 Additionally, it has three autosomal dominant hereditary variants, which can be caused by mutations in genes that break down clots, including the Surping i gene, which mutations result in a decrease in the blood protein CI inhibitor and the F12 gene
 Who controls Karak XII

 in teenon roopon ko vanshanugat vahikashof kaha jaataa he yaa kabhi kabhi ise ek puraane shabd "vanshanugat tantrika vahika shof" bhi kaha jaataa he
 All forms of HAE can also cause inflammation in the digestive placenta and other organs
 agar yah sujan shwaas nalee tak pahunch jaye to dam ghutane ke kaaran pranaghatak bhi ho sakati he
 The facial skin, usually the skin around the mouth and the mucosa of the mouth and the mucosa of the throat, and the tongue, become inflamed within a few minutes or a few hours
 kabhi kabhi sharir ke anya angon, vishesh rup se haathon main bhi sujan aa sakati he
 It may cause itching and pain
 prabhavit kshetron main tantrikaon ke sankuchan ke kaaran samvednaa main kami aa sakati he
 Also, hives can also develop
 gambhir maamalon main vaayu-maarg main sankuchan ho saktaa he, saans main gharghar kii aawaaj aane lagati he
 Oxygen levels may decrease
 aisi sthiti main saans main avrodh ko rokane or mrityu ke jokhim ko khatm karne ke liye shwasan maarg ko kholane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Occasionally, the patient has recently come into contact with an allergen, but often its cause is unknown or sometimes it is associated with an allergen
 vanshanugat vahikshof main, aksar koi pratyaksh kaaran nahin hota, haalanki halkaa sa aghat, jaise daanton kaa upachaar, yaa koi anya uttejnaa iskaa kaaran ho sakati he
 It does not usually cause hives or itching etc
, as it is not an allergic reaction of any kind
 echai ke marijon main baar baar pet dard kii sthiti utpann ho sakati he,, aamtaur par iske saath bahut adhik ulti aana, kamajori aana or kuch maamalon main patale dast, bina khujali vaali kharonchen jaisi ban janaa aadi lakshan paidaa ho jate hai
 This stomach problem may occur on average one to five days, during which aggressive hospitalization and hydration may require hospitalization
 pet main hone vaali in samasyaon ke kaaran rogi kii shwet rakt kanikaon kii sankhya bahut adhik bad jaati he, yah 13-30,000 ke aas paas pahunch jaati he
 As symptoms begin to disappear, the number of white blood cells begins to decrease and becomes normal until the trauma ends
 iske lakshanon or naidanik pareekshanon ko acute abdoman se vibhedit karnaa kathin he, aisi sthiti main echai ke rogiyon ke kai anaavashyak parikshan karvaa die jate hai jaise leprotomi or leproscopy
 echiai ke kaaran kai anya angon main bhi sujan aa sakati he jaise haath, pair, janan ang, gardan, galaa or cheharaa
 isamen hone vaala dard kabhi kabhi asahajata paidaa karata he or kabhi kabhi bahut ugr bhi ho saktaa he, yah iske sthiti or gambhirtha par nirbhar karata he
 It is almost impossible to ascertain where and when the next attack of edema will occur
 adhikansh rogiyon main aksar maah main ek baar iskaa aghat dekha jaataa he, lekin aise rogi bhi hai jinamein saptaah main ek baar yaa saal main sirf do teen baar hi iskaa aghat hota he
 There may be some variation in its symptoms as well, it may include infections, minor injuries, burns, stress etc
 zyaadaatar maamalon main, shof 12 se 36 ghanton main utpann hota he or 2 se 5 dinon main khatm ho jaataa he
 Diagnosis is made based on the clinical picture
 niyamit rup se rakt pareekshan praroopik rup se kiye jate hai
 The level of mast cell triptase can increase if the trauma is caused by a severe allergic reaction
 When the patient is stabilized, especially when the exact cause is detected by the investigation; a decrease in complement levels, particularly complement factors 2 and 4, indicates a decrease in CI inhibitors
 si i ke saamaanya str kar kaary ke saath echai prakaar III prekshit shof kaa ek nidaan he
 The hereditary form is often not known for long, as its symptoms are similar to many other diseases such as allergies and intestinal diseases
 ek mahatvapurn bindu yah he ki vanshanugat vahikshof antithistemins yaa steroid ke liye bhi pratikriya pradarshit nahin karata he, yahi lakshan ise saamaanya allergy se vibhedit karata he
 Diagnosis of HAE is very difficult in patients, especially those who have gastrointestinal symptoms
 rog ke paariwarik itihaas ke alaava, kevalprayogshaala vishleshan se hi antim pushti kii ja sakati he
 In this analysis, C4 levels are often found to be low, while C1-INH does not decrease that much
 pehle vaali sthiti pratiraksha pranali ke poorak tantra kii pratikriya ke kaaran hoti he, jo C1-INH ke viniman main kami ke kaaran sthaayee rup se atikriyasheel hoti he
 Bradykinin plays an important role in all forms of hereditary angioedema
 yah peptid ek shaktishaalee vahikavispharak he or sanvahani pargamyata ko badhaata he, jiske kaaran antaraali bhaag main taral kaa sanchay teji se hone lagata he
 This is clearly seen in the face, where the supporting tissue in the skin is relatively small
 or shof aasaani se viksit ho jaataa he
 The secretion of bradykinin results from the reaction of many stimulants by many types of cells
 paaya gaya he ki breadikinin kaa sandman echai lakshanon main aaraam detaa he
 Various systems that interfere with the production or inhibition of bradykinin can cause thrombosis
 isii sandamak isii ko baadhit karte hai, yah ek aisa anzime he jo breadikinin ko sandamit karata he
 In hereditary angioedema, the formation of bradykinin is due to the continued activation of the complement system due to its lack of a primary inhibitor C1-esterase
 saath hi iskaa ek or kaaran he kelikraine kaa nirantar nirmaan, yah ek anya prakriya he jo C1INH ke dwaara sandamit hoti he
 This serine protease inhibitor commonly inhibits the association of C1r and C1s with C1q and blocks the formation of the ci-complex, which activates other proteins in the complement system
 iske atirikt, yah thakke ko todane vaale bhinn proteinon ko sandamit karata he, haalanki is kami kaa hemarej or thrombosis ke vikaas par simit prabhaav hota hai
 There are three types of hereditary angioedema: prakaar i -C1INH kaa kam str ; Type II - Decreased function of C1INH at normal levels; prakaar III - C1INH main koi asaamanyata nahin, yah ek x -linkd prabhavi praturup main dikhaai detaa he or isliye mukhya rup se mahilaon ko prabhavit karata he; yah garbhavastha or hormonal garbhanirodh par hanikaarak prabhaav daal saktaa he
 This factor is related to mutations in the XII gene
 vahikashof C1INH ke khilaaf pratirakshi ke nirmaan ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he; yah ek swa-pratirakshi asaamanyata he
 Acquired angioedema is associated with the development of lymphoma
 aise bhojan kaa upbhog jo vahika ko failaane kaa kaam karte hai jaise alcohol or cynamon, sambhavi rogiyon main wahishof kii sambhaavna ko badha sakate hai
 If such a situation arises after the consumption of such food, it may be delayed by a few hours or overnight, which makes it somewhat difficult to relate to the consumption of this substance
 iske vipareet, haldi ke saath bromalen kaa upbhog lakshanon ko kam karne main phydemand ho saktaa he
 The use of aspirin or ibuprofen may increase the likelihood in some patients
 acetaminophen kaa upyog bhi kabhi kabhi isaki sambhaavna ko badha saktaa he
 Not using allergen and using antihistamines in allergic angioedema can prevent its future risk
 aksar aise rogiyon ko setarizine kii salaah di jaati he
 In some patients it has been found that consumption of this medicine in small amounts at night reduces its frequency and whenever such problem arises, then high dose of this medicine is given
 vahikashof ke gambhir maamalon main visugrahikaran kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he taaki mrityu ko jokhim ko khatm kiya ja sake
 puraane maamalon main steroid therapy kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisase aamtaur par acchhee pratikriya milti he
 Drug-causing inhibitors can cause angioedema
 isii sandamak anzime isii ko avaruddh karte hai, taaki yah breadikinin ke str ko or kam naa kar sake; is prakaar se breadikinin sanchit ho jaataa he or vaahikshof kaa kaaran banataa he
 This complication is more common in African Americans
 isii sandamak vaahikshof vaale logon main, dawa kaa upbhog rokna hota he or koi vaikalpik upachaar kaa prayog karnaa hota he, jaise aiarabi 
 isaki kriya pranbali bhi aisi hi hoti he, lekin yah breadikinin ko prabhavit nahin karata he
 However, this is controversial
 kuch chote adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki i si i sandamak vaahikshof ke rogiyon main aiarabi viksit ho saktaa he
 In hereditary angioedema, special stimulants that cause disease conditions should be discontinued
 It does not exhibit a response to antihistamines, carticosteroids, or epinephrine
 iske upachaar main daata ke rakt se sandrit C1-INH kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jise vahikaaon main pravisht kiya jaataa he
 In an emergency, fresh frozen blood plasma, which contains C1-INH, may be used
 haalanki, adhikansh europea deshon, sandrit C1-INH kaa upyog un rogiyon main kiya jaataa he, jo vishesh kaaryakramon main hissaa lete hai
 Fresh frozen plasma can be used alternatively in place of concentrated C1-INH
 arjeet vahikashof main, echai prakaar i or II or non-histaminorgic vaahikshof, antifibrinolietic jaise trnexmik amla yaa ε-amino caproic amla prabhavi ho sakate hai
 Synergine may also be useful because, it blocks the activation of C4 and can be used in liver patients, while androgens may not work
 dow Heinrich Quincke pehle 18 8 2 ke vahikashof main tasviir naidanik varnit he, haalanki vahaan kii sthiti pehle ke kuch vivaran diya gaya tha
 Sir William Osler commented in 18 8 8 that on the basis of some cases there may be a hereditary, he coined the edema term hereditary angio-neurotic

 china-japan yuddh 1894-95 ke dauraan china or japan ke madhya korea par prashasnic tathaa sainya niyantran ko lekar ladaa gaya tha

 Japan made China the main target of its imperialism and first in Korea it exercised its power with China
 korea apni bhugolic sthiti ke kaaran saamaajik or raajnneetik drushti se japan ke liye atyant mahatvapurn tha
 Therefore Japan had a great interest in the Korea Peninsula
 china ke manchu samraaton ne 17veen shatabdi main korea par adhikaar kar liya tha or tabhi se korea china kaa adheen pradesh mana jaataa tha
 Although Korea had its own separate king, the independent king of Korea accepted the suzerainty of the emperor of China
 is tarah korea kaa rajya china ke ek sangrakshit rajya ke samaan tha
 Japan had a traditional interest in the Korea Peninsula but, as of now, Japan did not get a chance to fulfill this interest
 kintu ab japan main sainikwaad kaa janm ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, it became necessary to follow the radical policy regarding Korea
 is samay korea europea rajyon kii samrajyavaadee niti ke bhanvarjaal main fas rahaa tha, aisi sthiti main korea china ke haath se nikalakar kisi bhi europea desh ke adhikaar main ja saktaa tha
 So Japan's anxiety grew and he decided that he could not leave Korea to his fate

 main japan kaa ek jahaaj korea ke samudratat par pahunchaa
 The Korean government began shelling the ship
 is kaaran ugravadi japani netaa korea ke viruddh yuddh ghoshit karne kii maang karne lage

 korea ke viruddh yuddh chhedane ke badale unhone nishchay kiya ki japan ek dootmandal korea bheje, jo vahaan kii sarkaar ko japan ke saath niyamanusaar vyapaarik sandhi karne ke liye prerit kare
 This messenger reached the capital of Korea in 1876 AD and Korea opened up trade to Japan, thus Japan gained many trading privileges
 japan ko korea main rajyakshetrathit adhikaar bhi mila or usne korea kii swatantra satta ko manyata de di
 This was a challenge to Chinese sovereignty, but as a result, the Japanese settled in Korea
