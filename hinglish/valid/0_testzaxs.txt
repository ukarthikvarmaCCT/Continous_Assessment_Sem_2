 Apache: This is the most popular software for web servers
 yadi aap vindos main kaam karte hai tathaa linaks par jane kii baat sochate hai to aap open aphis daat aurg, firefox, thanderbard, sanbird or jimp par kaam karke dekhen| When we are talking about open source software, then let us talk about the three acronyms that are used in this regard
 FOSS / FLOSS: free software, open sorce software he par har open sorce software, free software nahin he
 GPL for free software Must be published under license, but open source software can also be published under many other types of licenses
 donon main antar to he par sambandh bhi gaharaa he
 All this has started with free software, so such software is called Free Open Source Software or FOSS for short
 yahaan free shabd kaa arth swatantraaa se he par free shabd kaa arth bina paise ke bhi hota he isaliye free shabd kaa prayog kuch chakkar main daal detaa he
 There are two different words in the French language Gratis which means Libre without money which means freedom, so people often use Free / Libre Open Source Software or FLOSS
 LAMP: open sorce software ke chaar mukhya stambh hai: linuxappachemysqlpython, Perl, PHP ityadi Linux and Apache have already been discussed
 mysql ek data-base prabandh karne kaa program he
 Python, Perl, PHP, etc
 are computer languages for scripting and writing programs
 aane vaala kal ho saktaa he ki isi LAMP se ujjwalit ho isaliye open sorce software ko kinare na kijiye, dhyaan main rakhiye| Linus Torvalds, who is the originator of Linux, has written his biography with David Diamond
 iskaa naam he 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary’| yah bahut acchhee pustak he tathaa ise padhne se jivan main aage badhane kii prerana milti he vah is pustak main open sorce software ke bare main kehete hai, 'the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest will not be excluded from its development
 


so open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It’s still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people's rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that does not mandate legal protection for such secrecy
 ' jab ham log baat open software main kuch phaayde ke bare main kar rahe he to bahut acha hoga ki kuch doosraa paksh bhi dekhen| bill gates, vindos ke janmdata hai
 He has written the book 'the Road Ahead'
 yah pustak bhi bahut acchhee he
 According to its name, it tells which side of information technology will go in future
 Many difficult questions are explained very easily in this
 isamen ve free software kii kamiyon ko is tarah se varnan karte hai, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
 ' yah to kahana mushkil he ki software udyog kis taraf jaayegaa parantu duniya ke bahut saare desh tathaa vyapaar gharaane open sorce software ko apana hissaa bana rahe hai
 We are currently at a crossroads and are in a position to give a new twist to information technology

 ek aam computer upyogkarta ko anek kaamon ke liye password kii jarurat pad sakati he: computer vivarani main pravesh ke liye, sarwar se i-mail waapas paane ke liye, kaaryakramon tak pahunch banane ke liye, ankada sanchay, network, web sait or yahaan tak ki subah kaa akhbaar online padhne ke liye
 Regardless of the name, there is no need for the password to be the actual word; Actually, words are not real, they can be difficult to guess, it can be a useful material

 Usually an easy-to-remember password by the owner would mean an easy guess for an attacker

 In The Memorability and Security of Password, Jeff Yan et al
 Investigate the impact of advice given on good choice of users' passwords
 unhone paaya ki password soche gaye ek vaakyansh par aadhaarit tha or harek shabd kaa pehla varna yaad rakhane laayak liya gaya, kyonki sahajata ke saath password chunaa gaya tha or use todna kathin hota he kyonki password andhadhundh baahar nikalataa tha
 Combining two unrelated words is another good way
 duruh password banane ke liye nijee taur par "kalan ganit" dizin karnaa bhi ek anya acha tarika he
 However, when users are asked to remember "uppercase and lowercase mixed" passwords, they are asked to remember the order of the beat: harder to remember and harder to break
 upyogkartaaon "akshar or ank donon" kaa upyog karne ke liye kaha jaae to aksar pratisthapanaaon kaa anumaan lagaana aasaan ho jaataa he, jaise 'i' -> '3' or 'ai ' -> '1' kaa pratisthaapan, jise hamalavar acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 Similarly, typing a line above the keyboard as a password is also a very common known trick of attackers
 kisi password kii surakshit pranali kii suraksha kai karkon par nirbhar karata he
 Of course, the overall system needs to be designed as a good defense in man-in-the-middle attacks, or the like, against computer virus protection
 daraa-dhamka kar sholder surfing se lekar parishkrut bhautik khatre jaise ki video camera or keyboard snifer, jaise bhautik suraksha mudde bhi chintaa ke vishay hai
 And of course the password should be chosen in such a way that it is difficult for an attacker to guess it and it will be difficult for the attacker to find any available automatic attack tips
 password kii majbootee, computer suraksha or computer kii asuraksha ko dhyaan main rakhen
 Nowadays it is common for any computer system to hide the password as soon as it is typed
 darasal is upaay ke uddeshy baaju main khadey shaks se password ko pard lene se bachaana he
 However, some people argue that it can cause mistakes and it can cause stress, encourage the user to choose this easy password
 vaikalpik rup se, upyogkartaaon jab ve unhen tip karen to unke paas dikhaane yaa chhipaane kaa vikalp hona chahie
 There may be a provision in effective access control, such extreme measures should be taken for criminals who want to obtain passwords or biometric tokens
 Less extreme measures including extortion, rubber hose cryptanalysis, and lateral channel attack are relatively less extreme measures
 yahaan password prabandhan ke kuch vishisht mudde die ja rahe hai, password chunane yaa unka sanchaalan karte samay dhyaan se in par vichaar diya janaa jaruri he
 The extent to which an attacker can enter the system by guessing the password is an important factor in determining the security of the system
 ek choti-si ginati tak password daalane kii koshish kii asafalataa ke baad kuch pranaliyaan kuchhek second kaa nidhaarit samay adhiropit karti he
 In the absence of other weaknesses, such systems can effectively protect relatively simple passwords if passwords are chosen properly and are not easy to guess
 kai pranaliyaan password kii kryptographic hesh ko is tarah se sanchit karte hai ki hesh ke maan ko hamalavar ke liye sulabh bana detaa he
 When this is done and it is very common, the attacker can work off-line, rapidly checking the hash value of the real password instead of the person's password
 kryptographic kunjiyaan yaa vaai-faai suraksha) taiyaar karne ke liye jis password kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, bade had tak unka anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Lists of common passwords are widely available, which can make password attacks very efficient
 in sthitiyon main suraksha paryaapt jatil password yaa pasfrej ke istemaal par nirbhar karti he, aise abhiklanaatmak jatilta vaale hamale hamalavar ke liye avyavhaarik hote hai
 Some systems, such as PGP and wi-fi WPA, implement intensive computing hashes to slow down passwords in such attacks
 dekhen kii strengekthaning 
 Some computer systems store user passwords as clear text compared to user logon efforts
 agar hamalavar aise aantarik password sangrah ko praapt kar lene main kaamyaab ho jaataa he to sabhi password - or is kaaran sabhi upyogkarta ke khate - khatre main pad jaaenge
 agar koi upyogkarta vibhinn pranaaliyon ke liye ek hi password daalata hai to un par bhi khatra hoga
 More secure systems protect each password in a cryptography manner so that it is difficult for thugs to obtain real passwords that gain internal access to the system, but recognition of user access efforts is still possible
 
 ek saamaanya drushtikon keval saamaanya text ko "hashd" ke rup main sanchit karti he
 When the user types in a password on such a system, the password management software runs through cryptographic hash calculus and allows the user access if the value of the hash emitted from the user's entry matches the hash stored in the password database
 She goes
 hesh prakaarya ko lagu hesh kaa maan daale gaye password ko shaamil kiye gaye ek ladi main nirmit kiya jaataa he or aamtaur par anya maan sault ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Salt prevents attackers from easily creating a list of hash values for common passwords
 emdi5 or esechae1 kryptographic hesh prakaarya kaa aksar istemaal kiya karte hai
 a modified version of DES calculus mathematics was initially used in the Unix system for this purpose

 Recent systems like Unix or Unix to prevent or thwart attacks on accumulated password files) of any of MD5, SHA1, based blowfish, tofish or a variety of other calculus arithmetic that are still more effective defensive systems today Supposedly, used
 agar hesh prakaarya ko acchhee tarah dizin kiya gaya to sidhe taur par saamaanya text password ko khojane ke liye ise palata jaae to abhiklanaatmak jatilta ke kaaran yah avyavhaarik ho jayega

 Since these are software programs, a long list of possible passwords in many languages is widely available on the Internet to test common variations
 in shabdkoshon par hamale ke upkarnon kaa astitv upyogkarta ke password vikalp ko baadhit karata he, jinka aashay aasaan hamale ko rokna hota he or aisi suchi main ve milanevaale nahin hone chahie
 Obviously, words on such lists as passwords should be avoided
 yah khatra kam karne ke liye pibicadief2 jaise ki streacing hesh ke upyog ko dizin kiya gaya he
 Even after choosing a strong password, the hash function designed in an unsatisfactory way makes attacks possible

 Various methods are used to confirm the password introduced in a network setting: pramanikaran ke liye mashin main yaa kisi vyakti ko preshit kiya jaataa he to password main antaravarodhan ke khatre hote hai, jabaki yah satyaapan mashin yaa vyakti ko preshit kiya ja rahaa he
 There is a risk of espionage through the wiretapping method if the password passes through the unsecured external wires to the user's access point as an electrical signal and the central system controls the password database
 agar yah data packet ke rup main internet par vahan kiya jaataa he to packeton main band login jaankariyon ko koi bhi dekhne main sakasham hokar bahut hi ksheen sambhaavna ke saath jasusi kar saktaa he

 Emailed passwords are generally a method of unsafe delivery
 password ke clear text ke preshan kaa ek udhaaharan moulik vikipedia website he
 When you log in to a Wikipedia account, your username and password are sent in clear text via the Internet from your computer browser
 saidhantik rup main, pargaman ke dauraan unhen koi bhi pard saktaa he or uske baad aapke account main aapaki kii tarah pravesh kar saktaa he; aapaki taraf se is tarah ke hamalaavaron main antar karne kaa vikipedia ke sarwar ke paas koi rasta nahin he
 In practice, a relatively large number of unknowns can do this well
 haal hi main, vikipedia ne surakshit login vikalp kaa prastaav diya he, jo bahut saare i-commers citon jaise hi hai, clear text preshan ko radd karne ke liye protocol aadhaarit esasail / ) kryptography kaa istemaal karata he
 But, since anyone can access Wikipedia and then essentially edit all of the articles, it can be argued that there is little need to encrypt these sendings as it is little preserved goes
 anya website main bilkul alag kism kii suraksha kii aavashyaktaa he or kisi cheez kaa clear text kaa preshan un sandarbhon main spasht rup se asurakshit he
 The server of the system that manages the mail using client-side encryption will only send securely to the customer's machine

 In other approaches, the risk of intercepting passwords sent over the Internet can be reduced by using cryptography security

 When using TLS, most browsers warn the user of TLS / SSL for secure exchange with a closed lock icon or by some other signal
 anya bahut saare takinak kaa upyog hota he, dekhen kryptography 
 Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the accumulated hash-password and hash-based challenge-response authentication; The latter needs the client to prove that the server is aware of what was secretly shared; And to do this the server would need to be able to take the shared secret out of its archive

 Typically any system provides a way to change the password, either because the user feels that their current password is in danger, or does so as a precaution
 agar koi nayaa password system main bagaiyr kuta ke bheja gaya ho, password database main nayaa password install kiye jane se pehle suraksha par khatra paidaa ho saktaa he
 If a new password is given to an endangered employee, there is certainly little benefit
 kuch web site upyogkarta dwaara chune gaye password kii pushti ke liye bagaiyr kuta ke i-mail sandesh shaamil karte hai, nishchit rup se isse jokhim bad jaataa he
 Identity management systems make the most of the automatic replacement operation for lost passwords, a feature called self-service password reset
 upyogkarta se kuch sawaal puch kar or pehle se sanchit kiye hue jawaab se unki tulana karke pahchaan kii pushti karti he
 Common questions include: "where were you born?" "what is your favorite movie?" Or "what is your pet's name?" In many cases the answer to these questions can be relatively easy to guess by the attacker, with little effort of research or through social engineering, and so this confirmation technique is not entirely satisfactory
 jabaki kai upyogkartaaon ko password kabhi jaahir na karne kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he, kuch aisi chaukasee ke liye apane paaltu yaa pasandida ke cinema ke naam par vichaar karte hai
 "password aging" is a feature of some operating systems that often forces users to change passwords, with the intention that stolen passwords will soon become almost unusable
 Such policies usually provoke the user to resist as much as possible in order to obviate the legs and malice
 ho saktaa he upyogkarta password ko yaad rakhane yogya banaae rakhane ke liye saadhaaran tarah ke pattern viksit karen
 In any case, the security benefits are clearly limited, as attackers often use a password poorly, if appropriate, as soon as a threat is felt, which will probably change anytime before a change is needed

 kabhi kabhi kisi upkaran main abhigaman ko ek hi password niyantrit karata he, udhaaharan ke liye, ek network router ke liye, yaa password se surakshit mobile phone ke liye
 However, in a computer system, the password usually stores each user's account, thus all access is traceable)

 The same is the case for cash machines, except where the 'username' bank account number is usually stored in the bank customer's card and the PIN is very small
 kisi pranali main vaid upyogkartaaon dwaara ek hi password kaa upyog kiye jane ke liye pranali ke prayek upyogkarta ko alag password aavantit karnaa shreyaskar he, nishchit rup se suraksha ke drushtikon se
 yah aanshik rup se aisa isliye he kyonki upyogkarta apana vishesh password bataane ke bajaae saajha password aise kisi anya vyakti ko ko bataata he
 Changing a single password is less convenient, because it becomes necessary to tell a lot of people at the same time, and it becomes more difficult for them to erase the access of a particular user, for example in graduation or in registration
 agar upyogkarta apni gatividhiyon ke liye javabdeh he to prati upyogkarta ke liye alag password bhi aavashyak he, jaise ki vittiya lenden karne yaa medical record dekhne main hota he
 Common techniques used to improve the security of a password protected system include: kuch or adhik kathor niti lagu karne ke upayon main upyogkartaaon ko pruthak kar dene kaa jokhim paidaa kar saktaa he, iske parinamswaroop sambhawatah suraksha kam ho jaati he

 Because they are formed by more tropical cyclones whose temperatures are cooler than other cuttings, the ocean surface temperature used for their formation is three degrees Celsius, or five degrees Fahrenheit lower than the tropical cyclone threshold, Happens around 23 ° C
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki antah ushn katibandheey chakravaat paramparaagat seemaa ke baahar tufaani mausam main banate hai
 Although inter-tropical storms rarely have the pressure of stormy winds, they can be tropical in nature if their elements are heated
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek tufaani pranali he, jo ek kam dabaav centre he or garajadaar toofaan, tej hawaaen or zyada varsha detaa he
 a tropical cyclone is formed when heat is released from moist air, resulting in the release of vapor contained in moist air

 The term 'tropical' refers to both geologic forms, which are found exclusively in the tropical regions of the globe, and sea breeze is formed in tropical air clusters
 'chakravaat' shabd prakruti se tufaani chakravaat ko suchit karata he, jo uttari golarddh main uttaravarat or dakshini golarddh main dakshinavart ghoomte he
 Tropical cyclones are also known by other names, depending on location and power, such as hurricanes, hurricanes, tropical storms, cyclonic storms, tropical pressures, or cyclones only
} In general, a tropical cyclone is called a hurricane in the Atlantic basin and the Pacific Ocean

 Many tropical cyclones develop when the atmosphere conditions are favorable, with a weak upheaval in the atmosphere
 duusare tab banate hai jab anya prakaar ke chakravaat ushnkaribandheey visheshtaon ko praapt kar lete hai
 Tropical systems then drift into the gorge with blowing winds; If the situation is favorable, the tropics become turbulent and then a center develops there
 varnakram ke duusare chor par, agar pranali ke aas paas kii sthitiyaan bighad jaati hai yaa ushnkaribandheey chakravaat bhum bichhal banate hai, to pranali kamazor ho jaati he or antat nasht ho jaati he
 a tropical cyclone becomes an extra-tropical cyclone when it moves to higher latitudes if its energy is released by the original condensation that changes from the heat to the atmosphere between the air states; From a functional point of view, a tropical cyclone does not become intertropical during its additional transition
 messocyclone hawa kaa ek bhavar he, jo lagbhag2 kilometre 10 kilometre band toofaan ke vyas main, main nihit hota he
 The wind arises and rotates in the same vertical axis, same direction as in a low pressure system in any hemisphere

 This is a fundamental principle in quantum engineering field of modern physics
 jis str par manushyon kii indriyaan duniya ko bhaanpati hai, us str par koi bhi vastu yaa to kan hoti he yaa tarang hoti he, lekin ek saath donon nahin hote
 This does not happen at the very microscopic level of atoms, and to understand physics here, it was found that objects and light sometimes show the nature of the particle and sometimes the wave

 Some events make light appear to be wavelength and some appear particulate

 Like both rupee pages, there are two different forms of light

 This is exactly what was seen with strong rays of light

 In the nineteenth century, the Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell discovered four equations that were based on waves and which fully exposed the nature of light
 iske baad lagane laga ke prakaash vastav main vidyutchumbakeey tarang hi he
 On the contrary, the research that was being done on atoms, it seemed that the atom and its small fraction are particles
 parmaanu bhaar jaisi avadharanaayen jaise-jaise saamne ai vaise-vaise lagane laga ke vastav main parmaanu ek kan he jiske andar swayan anya chote-chote kan hi hai
 In the nineteenth century, many scientists were studying the electromagnetic radiation emanating from the black body and initially failed to make a true model of it in mathematics
 dhwani or anya tarangon main dekha jaataa he ke jab bhi kisi vastu main tarange banati hai to un tarangon kii tarangadairghy us vastu main maujuud khule sthaan par nirbhar karti he jahaan un tarangon ko banane kaa avasar miltaa he
 The sounds emanating from the flute used in music have a wavelength equal to or equal to the length of the first open hole from the flute's mouth
 ushmagatiki kaa ek siddhant he ki jo vastu ushmiya santulan main ho, usamen har sambhav urja dhaaran karne ke tareeke main saamaan str kii urja honi chahie
 In this study, dark matter was taken into thermal equilibrium and, because of its infinite loss, the energy must also appear in infinite wavelengths and be infinite
 lekin dekha gaya kii kaale padaarth se nikalati vidyutchumbakeey urja main aisa kuch nahin tha
 In 1900, the German scientist Max Planck broke this dilemma
 unhone kaha ke jab vidyutchumbakeey urja kaale padaarth ke kisi anu par padati he to vah use sokh letaa hai or ek uttejit sthiti main aa jaataa he
 When it gets enough energy, it comes back to its resting state by transmitting that energy in the form of an electromagnetic ray
 unhone parmaanu dwaara prasaarit urja ko ganit main E=hv likhaa, jisamen e urja he, v aavriti he or h ek niyatank he
 They meant that the source of the energy of dark matter is not the open space inside the dark matter located in thermal equilibrium, but the dark matter molecules that soak in energy and then release it when they come in conditions of excitation and relaxation
 
 badi aavriti kii kiran ke liye adhik urja chahie or vah tabhi chhori jaaegi jab uske baraabar kii urja sokh lee jaae
 They were found to be perfectly fine when they saw the electromagnetic energy emanating from the black material using the method of plank
 is se tahalaka much gaya, kyonki yah baat turant zaahir ho gayi ke jo uttejit anuon dwaara vidyutchumbakeey urja chodi ja rahi he unhen kiraanansh ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Until now, light was considered a wave
 usamen kanon kii pravriti dekhakar asamanjas paidaa hua kyonki iskaa arth yah bana ke prakaash kabhi kan or kabhi tarang hota he
 This twofold Planck himself was not willing to accept it and said that although his theory fits well, there is something wrong with his mathematics
 aane vaale dashakon ne dikhalaa diya ke koi aisi gadabad nahin thi
 Light actually has the form of wave-particle
 bahut se vaigyanik plank se sahamat the, ke prakaash keval tarang hi he or ve prayaas karne lage kii koi nayaa tareeqa mili jis se yah sabit ho sake
 Albert Einstein did the exact opposite
 unhone sweekaar liya ke prakaash main kanon kii bhi pravriti maujuud he or is sachai se ek purana masalaa hal karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In 1887, a German scientist named Heinrich Hertz discovered that when very short wavelength light falls on certain metals and other substances, an electric current is produced
 1901 main nicola testla ne dikhaaya ki vidyut isliye paidaa ho rahi he kyonki is prakaash se anayas hi dhaatu se electron utsarjit hote hai
 The very next year, in 1902, Philip Lennard discovered that light does not occur if it is of a large wavelength, no matter how much light is shed, while light waves with shorter wavelengths also do so
 ise prakaash vidyut prabhaav kaha jane laga or vaigyanik kai varshon tak yah samajhane main naakaam rahe ki aisa kyon hota he or kam tarangadairghy vaale prakaash se hi kyon hota he
 Einstein solved this trick with the theory of Planck
 unhone kaha ki vastav main prakaash ko uske kanon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Each particle of light contains the energy indicated in the planks, ie e = hv
 tarangadairghy or aavriti main ulta rishta hota he - bade tarangadairghy kaa matlab he ke prakaash ke kanon main aavriti kam hogi or plank niyam ke anusaar urja bhi kam hogi
 a lower wavelength means that particles of light will have a higher frequency and energy will also be higher according to Planck's law
 unhone is aadhaar par kuch bhavishyavaaniyan kareen jo prayogshaala main bilkul thik pai gayin
 For this, Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
 maiks plank ko us se bhi pehle, 1918 main, bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 After the discovery of Einstein, it became impossible to deny that light has both particle and wave trends
 1925 ke baad prakaash ke kanon ko photone bulaayaa jane laga or yah naam ab prachlit ho chukaa he
 After the discovery and victory of Einstein, scientists gradually began to believe the wave-particle form of light, when in 1924 the French scientist Louis de Broy added another sensation to the world of physics
 unhone kaha ke na sirf prakaash, balki saare padaarth ke bhi tarang-kan dvirup hote hai or kisi bhi gatisheel padaarth ko tarang yaa kan ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 He showed in his mathematics that the wavelength of a moving particle depends on its momentum - teen saal baad electronon ke saath prayogon main bilkul yahi paaya gaya
 They are fragments of atoms and were always considered particles, but when the electron beam was thrown on a screen, they showed images of diffraction with waves, just like strong light
 unki is khoj ke liye da broai ko 1929 main bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 In 1927, the German scientist Werner Heisenberg published his uncertainty principle in which he said that it can never be said with absolute certainty where an object is located or what its motion is
 unhone spasht kiya kii yah kisi maapdand main kami kii vajah se nahin he, balki prakruti main hi aisa niyam he
 Just as a wave cannot be said about where it is located, in the same way it cannot be said about objects
 jitani choti vastu hogi uske akar ke hisaab se utani hi anischitata adhik hogi
 He wrote it in mathematics like this - jahaan This uncertainty principle soon became an important part of the foundation of quantum mechanics, and it also contained the identification of the wave-particle form of matter

 The countries of Europe exploited them politically and economically for a long time by throwing their imperialist net on the countries of Asia and Africa, but the freedom movements emerging in those countries destroyed the intentions of the imperialist countries
 dhire-dhire asia or africa ke desh ek-ek karke samrajyavaadee chungal se mukti paane lage
 When the imperialist powers were seen spending their days, they started looking for new ways of colonial exploitation
 unhone is prakriya main un deshon par apana varchasv banaae rakhane ke liye aarthik samrajyavad kaa sahaara liya
 After becoming independent, the budding nations were not in a position to develop their own independent economic development
 unke aarthik vikaas main sahaayta ke naam par viksit samrajyavaadee deshon ne dollar kii kootneeti kaa prayog karke unki arthvyavasthaaon par apana niyantran sthapit kar liya or dhire-dhire ve nae samrajyavad ke jaal main is kadar funs gaye ki aaj tak bhi ve viksit deshon ke hi paradheen hai
 This system is known as neo-colonialism
 yah ek nai avadharana he
 It is used for new types of imperialism
 ise 'dollar samrajyavad', 'aarthik samrajyavad', 'nayaa-samrajyavad' aadi naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 After World War II, most of the subjugated nations became politically independent but still indirectly remained a victim of imperialism in one way or the other
 unki yah sthiti aadhunik samrajyavad yaa nav-upniveshwaad kehalaati he
 It is a system that shows the relation of a powerful developed nation or a less powerful nation to an economic or satellite colony
 bahurashtriya nigam iske pramukh saadhan hai
 Their purpose is to maintain their dominance over the economically subordinate or satellite colonies by exploiting them more and more
 raashtrapati sucarno ne bandung sammelan main 1955 main kaha tha ki raashtra ke andar chote se videshi samudaay dwaara aarthik niyantran, bauddhik niyantran tathaa vaastavik bhautik niyantran ke rup main yah ek nae libaas main upniveshwaad he
 His clear reference was to the increasing role of multinational corporations
 aaj viksit desh apana samrajyavaadee shikanja kasne ke liye inkaa sahaara le rahe hai
 By this, control over the raw materials of poor countries is being done in the form of termites in the name of capital export and easy exchange rates so that those countries become centers of supply of raw materials and sale of finished goods
 is prakaar kaha ja saktaa he ki nav-upniveshwaad samrajyavaadee niyantran kii aisi prakriya he jiskaa prayog viksit raashtra navdith alp viksit rashtron kaa aarthik shoshan karne ke liye karte hai
 These nations are politically independent, but depend on developed countries in the area of economic aid, military aid, arms assistance, technical knowledge, production
 inaki viksit deshon par nirbharta itani adhik bad jaati he ki ye apratyaksh rup se raajnneetik rup se bhi swatantra nahin rah jate
 Argenski has described three forms of colonialism - political colonialism, economically subjugated country and hangover country
 aadhunik yug main raajnneetik drushti se to sabhi desh swatantra ho chuke hai
 Therefore, it is no longer important
 vah antim do ko hi nav-upniveshwaad ke antargat shaamil karata he
 These countries are politically independent but look to developed nations for financial support
 in deshon main aarthik pichhadaapan paaya jaataa he
 Poverty and unstable political systems of the people are indicative of this
 logon kii vyaktigat aay va rashtriya aay naam maatr kii hoti he
 The newly independent nations of Asia and Africa joined this category
 lambe samay tak aarthik vikaas ke liye unhen videshi sahaayta par nirbhar hue
 Most of them still fall under the category of economically subordinate nations
 viksit deshon ne in deshon main adhik se adhik puunji lagaakar inamen apni utpaadan ikaiyaan sthapit kar rakhi hai
 In many countries, this investment is up to 80 percent
 ye desh parashrith rashtron ke raajnneetik jivan ko bhi prabhavit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Such countries are called economic dependent colonies
 america dwaara pakistan, thailand, ghana aadi asia va africa ke deshon main dollar samrajyavad kii niti kaa prasar is prakaar ke upniveshwaad kaa hi ek hissaa he
 It is a nation that is formally independent but politically and economically subject to any foreign power
 ve desh swatantra videsh niti kaa paalan karne main sakasham nahin hote
 After World War II, communist governments controlled by the Soviet Union were established in many countries
 ve sabhi desh pichhalggu desh yaa upgrah upnivesh kii shrenee main aate the
 Today there is a us-backed government in Afghanistan
 isliye afghanistan america kaa pichhalggu desh he
 When needed, military assistance is also provided by many masters to the hanger countries
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad donon mahashaktiyon ne apane pichhalggu deshon kii har prakaar se madad kii thi
 The condition of these colonies is much worse than economically dependent countries
 dwitiya vishwayuddh tak pahunchate-pahunchate samrajyavaadee shaktiyaan itnaa adhik kamjor ho gai ki ve paradheen rashtron par apana samrajyavaadee niyantran banaae rakhane main ayogy siddh hone lage
 At the same time, the independence movement that emerged as a result of the constantly emerging political consciousness in the subjugated countries also caused great harm to the imperialist powers
 do vishwa yudhon ne samrajyavaadee deshon kii arthvyavasthaaon ko baari nuksaan pahunchaaya
 They are no longer in a position to take iron from the agitational forces
 isliye unhone apana samrajyavaadee niyantran dhilaa kar diya or upniveshi shashan kaa ant hone laga
 But after this a new type of imperialism was born which is known as neo-colonialism or economic imperialism
 yah viksit samrajyavaadee deshon dwaara apni khandit arthvyavasthaaon ko patari par laane ke liye kiye gaye prayaason kaa mahatvapurn hissaa tha
 The imperialist powers wanted that by economic control they could gain the same benefits as they had before, by exercising their control over the economic life of the newly independent nations
 iske janm ke nimnlikhit kaaran hai- Gradually, there was a rise of political consciousness in countries who were victims of colonial exploitation
 isse vahaan par swatantrata aandolan kaa teji se vikaas hone laga
 a national liberation movement like India made the colonial forces realize that now their control could not last long
 sanyukt raashtra sangh ke charter main aatmanirnay ke adhikaar ko sweekruti mil chuki thi
 Therefore, due to the fragility of time, they had to free their colonies
 parantu un deshon kii raajnneetik asthirataa ne in deshon ko apana aarthik niyantran sthapit karne kaa mauka de diya
 This transformed old colonialism into a new form
 do vishwa yudhon ne europe kii samrajyavaadee takaton ko bhayankar haani pahunchaai
 Now ruling in the colonies was out of their power
 lagaataar uth rahe mukti andolanon ne bhi bade-bade samrajyon ko nasht kar diya
 Fearing the loss that England had to suffer in India, the British expressed their inability to continue their colonial rule here
 navdith prabhusatta sampann rajyon ne antarrashtriya sambandhon ko prabhavit karnaa shuru kar diya
 China emerged as a communist force in 1949
 ab vahaan par samrajyavaadee takaton kaa tikna mushkil ho gaya
 Mao warned all imperialist forces of dire consequences
 lekin sabhi navdith raashtra china va bharat jaise shaktishaalee nahin the
 Most countries did not have the capability of their economic development
 isliye unhone apane puraane sahukaaron par hi nirbharta kii ichha vyakt kii
 All imperialist forces began to intervene in the countries under their control in the name of financial aid
 isse vahaan nav-upniveshwaad kaa janm hua
 All the newly independent nations felt the need of foreign financial help for their economic development
 lambe samay aupniveshik shashan ke shikaar rah chuke adhiktar deshon ke aarthik sadhano kaa dohan samrajyavaadee desh kar chuke the
 These budding nations had neither sufficient capital nor technical knowledge to finance their economic growth, and forced these countries to borrow from the old colonial powers to achieve their economic development goals
 isse in deshon main puraani upniveshi takatein phir se apana jaal bichaane main kaamyaab hui or nae-upniveshwaad kaa janm hua
 The two world wars caused great economic losses to imperialist forces
 upniveshvaadi shashan ke ant ke saath hi unke kachche maal ke òt tathaa taiyaar maal bechney vaali mandia samaapt ho gai
 This made the imperialist countries need to know what to do to find mandis and obtain raw materials in the newly independent nations
 aise samay main navdith rashtron kii aarthik majaburiyon kaa laabh uthaane kaa vichaar unke man main aayaa
 So they started to intervene in these countries in the name of economic aid and gradually tried to establish neo-colonial rule there, which brought the notion of neo-colonialism there
 is vyavastha ne samrajyadi takaton kii samast ichchhaaon ko puraa karne main bharpoor sahaayta pahunchaai
 After World War II, Cold War started in the US and Soviet Union
 donon mahashaktiyon ne apni apni sthiti majboot karne ke liye nae rashtron ko apane guton main shaamil karne kaa nirnay kiya
 By means of foreign aid, arms supply, control over multinational corporations, these superpowers took the newly independent nations financially under their control
 isse upgrahi rajyon kii sankhya main vruddhi hone lagi
 All their economic policies were one by one to provide a strong foundation for neo-colonialism
 aaj bhi america jaise viksit raashtra bahurashtriya nigamon ke madhyam se apane nav-upniveshvaadi niyantran ko sudrudh bana rahe hai
 Rich and powerful imperialist nations adopt different ways of controlling themselves in the newly independent nations to fulfill their economic interests
 unka mukhya dhyey aviksit deshon par apana nayaa samrajyavaadee niyantran sthapit karnaa he
 The means adopted by them for this are: sabhi dhani deshon dwaara vishwa ke sabhi bhaagon main aarthik tathaa audyogic ikaiyon ko niyantrit karne ke liye bahurashtriya nigamon kaa jaal bichaaya gaya he
 Due to their economic power and scope in their field, they start doing their own arbitrary work in all the countries under their jurisdiction
 inkaa uddeshy adhik se adhik laabh kamanaa hota he
 These multinational companies in developing countries guarantee the supply of raw materials and primary production for capitalist countries by investing direct capital
 ye sarvaadhik nivesh praathmik utpaadan tathaa kaccha maal ke kshetra main karte hai
 They see maximum profit in the investment of basic necessities in life
 vikasshil deshon main saste shram, kachche maal tathaa shoshan kii tivrata ke kaaran puunji nivesh se adhik munafa hota he
 In 1996, 741 foreign companies invested in India
 bharat jaise vikasshil desh main bhi in companiyon ko kai guna laabh praapt hota he
 To protect their capital, these corporations also intervene in the internal affairs of the countries under their control
 ye companiyaan videshon main antarrashtriya puunji vyapaar, vaanijya tathaa utpaadan va vitaran par apana ekadhikaar karne ke liye kaary kar rahe hai
 They have complete control over the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America
 IBM, GEC tathaa Standard Oil jaisi companiyaan in deshon se kaaphi munafa uthaa rahi hai
 They also do not miss political intervention of the nations under their control to bring their profit rate to the maximum level
 is prakaar bahurashtriya nigam nav-upniveshwaad ke sabase adhik shaktishaalee saadhan hai or inhen sabhi viksit rashtron kaa puraa samarthan praapt hota he
 The newly independent nations are completely dependent on foreign aid and imperialist debt for their economic development
 apane karj kii aad main tathaa videshi sahaayta ke naam par viksit raashtra in deshon ko manamaani sharten maanane ke liye baadhya kar dete hai
 They also have to accept many harsh conditions while taking loans
 in deshon kaa karja din-pratidin badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Majority of the income derived from exports goes to repay the interest of imperialist debt and the deficit of balance of payments continues to increase
 unhen is karj kii raashi kaa prayog bahurashtriya companiyon se hi saamaan kharidne ke liye karnaa padataa he
 They also have to accept the conditions for the elimination of trade barriers
 sabhi sharten puunji nivesh karne vaale deshon ke hiton kii poshak hoti hai
 a country receiving foreign aid always has to make fundamental changes in its economy to increase the interests of the investor or the country providing aid
 dhire-dhire samrajyavaadee karj or videshi sahaayta par vikasshil deshon kii nirbharta badhati hi jaati he
 The condition of less developed or backward countries is worse than that of developing countries
 is prakaar kaha ja saktaa he ki videshi sahaayta tathaa samrajyavaadee karj kii hode main viksit desh nav-upniveshwaad kaa hi poshan kar rahe hai
 In today's nuclear age, every nation wants to see itself secure from military and strategic point of view
 iske liye unhen viksit deshon se shastr kharidne padate hai
 Due to being economically weak, these countries also take loans many times
 aaj vikasshil deshon kii rashtriya aay kaa adhiktar hissaa hathiyaar kharidne par hi kharch ho rahaa he
 Shakti demonstration by superpowers promotes weapons competition
 1979 main mahashaktiyon kaa aapasi takaraav videshon main pahunchakar paryaapt laabh dilaae
 The power demonstrations made by these superpowers after the Second World War proved helpful in reducing the decline in their arms industry
 aaj tritiy duniya ke adhiktar desh america, france, britain tathaa soviet sangh se hi hathiyaar kharidte hai
 In order to strengthen their colonial position, imperialist countries have opened their military bases in third world countries
 hathiyaaron kii purti ke rup main ye desh nav-upniveshwaad ko hi badhaava de rahe hai
 Today international institutions like World Bank, International Monetary Fund are operating the international economy
 ye sansthaaen rin dete samay kathor sharten lagaakar nav-upniveshwaad kaa hi poshan karti hai
 Loans to countries are always based on political restrictions
 vah hameshaa viksit rashtron ke hiton kaa hi poshak hota he
 That is why third world countries are strongly demanding for the new international economy
 unka aarope he ki vishwa kii aarthik sansthaaen samrajyavaadee hiton ko poshit karne vaali he
 They continuously attack the economic and political interests of backward or developing countries
 is tarah ye upniveshwaad ke nae rup ko badhaava de rahi hai
 The imperialist powers continue to weaken the backward nations by providing financial assistance
 vahaan ke aarthik va raajnneetik jivan main samrajyavaadee yaa niveshkarta desh kaa puraa hastkshep bad jaataa he
 If the foreign power maintains complete control over the trade of the dependent country, then their control gradually acquires permanent and this dependency continues to grow and eventually takes the form of a satellite state
 ab samrajyavaadee takat aarthik kshetra kii bajaay raajnneetik kshetra kii taraf apana dhyaan laga leti he
 This forces the satellite nation to obey everything about its mentor
 1990 se pehle soviet sangh ne is prakaar kii niti kaa khulkar prayog kiya tha
 Behind this, only the spirit of spread of neo-colonialism exists
 is prakaar kaha ja saktaa he ki aaj bhi nav-upniveshwaad ke rup main viksit raashtra alpaviksit tathaa vikasshil deshon par apana varchasv banaae hue hai
 The poor countries of the south are constantly falling prey to the exploitation of neo-colonialism
 uttar ke viksit desh bahurashtriya nigamon tathaa antarrashtriya aarthik sansthaaon ke madhyam se in deshon par apni pakad majboot banaae hue hai
 Multinational companies are entering termites in developing and backward countries
 adhiktar deshon main ye raajnneetik vyavhaar ko bhi prabhavit karne main samarth he
 Developed nations are also resorting to cultural imperialism to fulfill their interests
 shityudh kii samaapti ke baad sanyukt rajya america vishwa main apane aarthik yaa dollar samrajyavad kaa teji se vikaas kar rahaa he
 Along with economic life, it has also started interfering in the political activities of developing and backward third world countries
 yadi uske ubharate nav-upniveshwaad ko na roka gaya to samast vishwa ke liye nayaa khatra paidaa ho jayega
 Today, Third World countries need to unite and uproot the roots of neo-colonialism to establish a new international economy
