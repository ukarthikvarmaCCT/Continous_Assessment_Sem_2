 Some historians believe that the seeds of civil war were contained in the American freedom struggle itself, while some consider civil war as capitalist movement and some historians have attributed slavery to civil war
 america grihayuddh ke nimnlikhit kaaran the- The situation in the northern states of the United States was relatively strong demographically and economically
 sangh ke 34 rajyon main se 23 rajya uttar main sammilit the or desh kii kul jansankhya kaa 2 / 3 bhaag uttar main rahata tha, jisamen daason kii sankhya bahut kam thi
 Industry was predominant in the northern states
 udyogon main sooti, oonee vastra, chamade ke saamaan aadi vasteen bade paimaane par utpaadit hoti thi
 In these factories, labor was produced by machines, so slaves and slaves did not have much importance here
 duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon kaa aarthik jivan krishi par aadhaarit tha or krishi main yantron kaa bahut adhika prayog nahin hota tha
 Hence the peasants of these states depended on the labor of slaves for farming
 dakshin main kapaas, ganna evam tambaaku kii kheti bahut bade paimaane par hoti thi jisamen das majdoor ke rup main kaary karte the
 Therefore, the society of the south was completely dependent on slaves

 State industries in North America were predominant, so budding entrepreneurs there sought protection to avoid foreign competition
 unke hiton ko dhyaan main rakh america sangh dwaara udyogon ko sangrakshan diya gaya
 But this step was objected to by the southern states
 kyonki sangrakshan kii niti ke kaaran ab unhen vinirmit vasteen apekshaakrit mahange mulya par milti thi
 Therefore, they felt that the Union was being used for the interests of North America and a view of neglect towards the southern states
 america ke uttari rajyon main daason kii aarthik jivan main koi nirnaayak jivan main koi nirnaayak bhoomika nahin thi
 Therefore, the importance of slaves was secondary to them
 On the other hand, slavery in the southern states of America had dissolved in life
 dakshini rajyon ke maamlen main das pratha kaa mudda sadaiv samvedansheel bana rahaa
 Whenever other states arose to implement the ban on slavery in these southern states, these states considered it an attack on their sovereignty
 vastutah uttari rajyon main daastaa ko maanavtaa par kalank ke rup main dekha gaya or ise samaapt karne ke kii maang jor shor uthaai gai

 Slave trade was abolished in North America and slavery ceased in the north to the southern border of Pennsylvania

 Now America was expanding into the western regions and new territories were being included in the United States
 aise main yah prashn uth khadaa hua ki in rajyon ko das rajya ke rup main yaa swatantra rajya ke rup main shaamil kiya jaae
 This issue was also important because in the constitution it was accepted that slaves were also counted in the federal administration, but the population of slaves was represented at an average of 3 / 5 ie if the population of slaves would be 500 then consider it 300 Representation began to be given
 is tarah das rajyon kii sankhya main vruddhi ho jane se vyavasthapika main das rajyon kaa varchasv bad jane kaa khatra tha

 This was followed by a proposal to merge Texas into the Union

 In this way, the question of the merger of states widened the gap between the northern and southern states

 By February 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Lulciana, and Texas also disbanded the Union and appointed Jefferson Davis as their President, and the Civil War began, with the bombing of Sumter's Fort from South Carolina as the Union
 Waged war against dakshini rajyon dwaara sangh se alag ho jane ke kaaran ek mahatvapurn sanvaidhanik prashn khadaa ho gaya ki kya dakshini raj ko sangh se alag hone kaa adhikaar he? linkan ne raashtrapati pad par nirvachan ke pashchaat spasht rup se ghoshnaa kii ki sanyukt rajya america ke rup main jo sangh sthapit kiya gaya tha vah akhandaneey or shaashwat he, uski akhandaneeyata ko kisi prakaar nasht nahin hone diya jayega
 The framers of the US Constitution have not given any state the right to secede from the Union
 linkan ne ghoshit kiya ki "agar ham sabhi daason ko mukt kar sangh ko bachaa sake to ham aisa karenge agar ham daason ko mukt kiye bina sangh ko bachaa sake to ham aisa karenge or agar kuch daason ko mukt kar tathaa kuch anya ko mukt nahin karke sangh ko bachaa sake to ham vah bhi karenge
 "in this way Lincoln attempted to preserve the Union

 He organized the forces and broke the challenge of armed struggle of the south

 In 1861, Lincoln abolished the slave system and invited him to join the national armies
 kintu iskaa uddeshy dakshini rajyon ko nasht karnaa nahin varan sangh ko banaae rakhana hi tha
 He believed that the declaration of the freedom of slaves would lead to rebellion of slaves in the southern states and that they would not get the help of slaves in war

 Resolved the dispute over the rights of the long-standing provincial and federal states
 dakshini rajyon ke aatmasamarpan ke pashchaat unhen sangh main punah shaamil kiya gaya
 This meant that the union of states would remain undone and that the right to separatism would never arise again in the future
 vastutah grihayuddh ke parinaam ne is sanvaidhanik prashn ko hal kar diya ki rajyon ko sangh se alag hone kaa adhikaar nahin he
 In this way the principle of the "indestructible Union of Indestructible States" mentioned in the constitution was confirmed
 ab raajnneetik rup se america ko vaastavik sanyukt raashtra kaa rup pradaan kiya gaya
 An important achievement of civil war in the social sphere was the abolition of slavery from America

 Bold text chichen itza yaa chichen itza columbus-purv yug main maaya sabhyataa dwaara banaaya gaya ek bada shahar tha
 Chichen Itza was a major center in the Late Classics through the North Classical and in the northern part of the northern Maya in the early part of the early postclassical period

 The name is believed to have been derived from itz of Maya, which means "magic" and á means "water
" In Spanish itzá means "brujas del Agua" but a more accurate translation is the Wizard of Water
 is naam ko spanish main or spanish se anya bhashaaon main anuvaadit karte samay yah darshane ke liye ki naam ke donon bhaagon ke antim shabdaansh par bal diya gaya he, ise praayah Chichén Itzá' ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 In other contexts, a more rigorous spelling has been used in which the word is written according to the Mayan language using Chich'en Itzá

 chilam balam kitabon main aise sakshya hai ki uttari yuctan main itza aadhipaty ke aagaman se pehle is shahar ke liye ek anya naam bhi tha
 The name is difficult to define due to the lack of a single standard of spelling, but it is represented in various forms, such as Uuc Yabnal, Uuc Hab Nal, or Uc Abnal
 While most people agree that the first word means seven, there is considerable debate over the exact translation of the rest

 Some ethnohistoric sources claim that in about 987 a Toltec king named Aktal Quetzalcoatl from Topiltijn arrived here with the army of central Mexico and made Chichen Itza his capital and a second Tula
 An interesting blend of Maya and Toltec styles is found in the art and architecture of this period

 In the late 1980s, many archaeologists suggested that unlike earlier Mayan politics of the early Classical period, Chichen Itza may not have been governed by a single individual or by a single monarchical dynasty

 According to Mayan history, Hanak Seal, the ruler of Mayapan, conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century
 Hunak Seal is believed to have predicted his rise to power
 us samay kii parampara ke anusaar, jin vyaktiyon ko senot sagrado main phenkaa jaataa tha unke batch jane kii sthiti main yah mana jaataa tha ki unamem bhavishyavaanee kii shakti he
 During one such ceremony, there is a discussion in history that no person survived, so Hunak jumped into the seal Senot Sagrado and predicted his rise when removed
 jabaki aise kuch puratathvik sakshya maujuud hai jo sanket dete hai ki ek samay chichen itza ko lutaa gaya or tahas-nahas kar diya gaya tha, aise sakshya adhik hai jo bataate hai ki vah maayaapan dwaara nahin tha, kam se kam tab nahin jab chichen itza ek sakriy shahari centre tha
 Archaeological data show that Chichen Itza perished in about 1000 CE, two centuries before the rise of Mayapan

 In 1526 the Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo successfully petitioned the King of Spain to conquer Yucatán

 Montejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichen Itza, which he renamed Ciudad Real
 At first he did not face any resistance and divided the land around the city and gave it to his soldiers in the prize
 The Maya became more aggressive over time and eventually sieged the Spanish and cut off their supply routes from the coast and forced them to confine themselves to the ruins of the ancient city
 Several months passed, but no military aid arrived
 Montejo the Younger attempted to launch an external attack against Maya and he also lost the remaining 150 forces
 In 1534, in the dark of night, he was forced to abandon Chichen Itza
 By 1535, all Spaniards were expelled from the Yucatán Peninsula

 These pillars are in three distinct sections: a former group, extending the front row of the Temple of Warriors; a north group, which runs along the south wall of the Temple of the Warriors and has pillars on which the following carvings of soldiers are carved; And a northeastern group, which apparently forms a small shrine on the south eastern corner of the Temple of Warriors, including rectangular carvings adorned with animals and serpents in addition to humans or gods

 And literary contribution is very important
 According to the description of the North Indian andhra-tailang-bhatt-family tree, "in the Atreya gotra of the Tailang Brahmins, there was the original ancestor Srivayenkatesha Ananamma in the Taittriya Aastambha of the Yaturveda" - in whose sixth generation was born in the family of Jagannivasji such a remarkable scholar as Shivanand Goswami

 Many scholars of the time had 'defeated' them and received their discipleship
 Jagannivasji, who was born in this family of Yashopataka of the same Atreya clan, spread across rivers and seas, was invited by the King of Bundelkhand and received 'initiation' from them
 The king became his disciple
 The same great scholar Jagannivasji had three sons - Srisiromani Bhatt, Sreejanardan and Srichakrapani
