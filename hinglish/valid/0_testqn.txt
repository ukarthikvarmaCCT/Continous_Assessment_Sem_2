 The dates of the beginning and end of this campaign are disputed by historians, but in most opinion it began with the Vienna Conference on the end of Napoleon Bonaparte's reign over Italy in 1815, and in 1870 by the armies of King Fiancorio Emanuele on Rome
 It went on till occupation
 dhyaan den ki 1870 ke baad bhi kuch italvi pradesh is sangathit italy main shaamil nahin the or ve pratham vishwayuddh ke baad hi uskaa hissaa bane
 Due to the wars of Napoleon, the Italians experienced a sense of unity and decided to organize their country as one nation

 The history of Rome's ancient glory was known to the people

 Therefore, he once again dreamed of making Italy a national icon
 yahi kaaran he ki anek kathinaayeeyon or vifaltaaon ke baavjood vahaan rashtriya-ekikaran kaa sangharsh jari rahaa
 The ultimate success was liberalism and nationalism against reactionaryism, and the work of unification of Italy was completed

 The Vienna Congress disregarded the will of the people and the spirit of nationalism, reviving various states in Italy
 uske dwaara italy kii jo naveen vyavastha kii gayi, uski ruparekha is prakaar thi- Thus Italy was divided into three parts
 inamen alag-alag shaasha the
 It was not favorable in terms of nationality, so the people there were dissatisfied with this system
 aisi sthiti main unhone sampurna italy ko ek raashtra kaa darja pradaan karne kaa prayaas kiya
 There were many obstacles in the success of this work, which needed to be overcome
 1815 i

 iske liye unhone anek gupt-samitiyon kaa gathan kiya, jinamein carbonary sabase-prasiddh thi
 Its net was laid in almost all of Italy
 isaki prerana se italy main anek vidroh hue, jinhen meternikh ke dwaara kuchal diya gaya

 After his release from prison, he formed an organization called "youth-italy", which brought political awakening in the country
 isaki sadsy sankhya main nirantar vruddhi hoti gayi
 In 1833, the number of young-italy members increased to 60 thousand
 usne yah kaha ki naye vichaar tabhi failte hai jab use shheedon ke khun se sinchaa jaataa he
 He considered the leadership of the youth important
 vah desh kii tatkaaleen vyavastha se dukhi tha or usamen sudhaar laane kaa upaay sochataa tha
 Addressing the people of the country, he said that our reputation and progress is blocked
 hamaari shandaar pracheen parampara rahi he, par vartmaan main na hamaara koi rashtriya astitv nahin he
 He blamed Austria for this
 atah usne uske khilaaf sangathit hokar uskaa saamana karne kii aavashyaktaa pratipaadit kii
 In this way, Mezzini, with his ideas, encouraged the people of Italy for national integration and filled them with a sense of patriotism and sacrifice
 vah swayan ganatantr kaa samarthak tha tathaa anya logon ko bhi vah swatantraaa kaa paath padhaata tha
 Thus he remained the forerunner of Italy's struggle for independence

 Hence, the patriots tried to achieve independence

 The credit of which goes to his doctor father
 vah apane pita se prerana praapt kar kranti sambandhi sahitya kaa adhyayan karata rahaa, isiilie vah balykaal se hi krantikari vichaaron kaa poshak ho gaya

 main yang-italy ke sadasyon kii sankhya 60 hajaar ho gayi
 He said that new ideas spread only when they are watered with the blood of the martyrs
 vah yuvakon ke netritv ko mahatvapurn maanata tha
 He was unhappy with the then system of the country and thought of a way to improve it
 usne desh kii janata ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki hamaari pratishtha or unnati avaruddh he
 We have a wonderful ancient tradition, but we do not currently have a national existence
 iske liye usne austria ko doshi bataaya
 Therefore, he organized against him and proclaimed the need to face him
 is prakaar mejini apane vichaaron se italy kii janata ko rashtriya-ekikaran ke liye protsaahit karata rahaa or unamem deshprem or balidaan kii bhaavana ko kuta-kootakar bharta rahaa
 He himself was a supporter of the republic and he also taught freedom lessons to others
 is prakaar vah italy ke swadhinata ke sangharsh kaa agradoot bana rahaa
 The French Revolution of 1848 also had an impact on Italy
 atah deshbhakton ne swatantraaa praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He did not succeed in this endeavor, but his enthusiasm remained due to the fall of Metternich
 dekhen, victor emanuele dwitiya The ruler of Piedmont, Victor Emanuel, was different from other European rulers
 vah rashtriyata or loktantrwaad kaa samarthak tha
 He was a true patriot, heroic and patient
 usne italy ke ekikaran main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 It was moderate
 uske in vichaaron se prabhavit hokar desh kii janata ne use ek eemaandaar raja kii oopaadhi di
 It became very popular among the public
 kavur unka yogya pradhanmantri tha
 There was a proper coordination between the two in national affairs and with the desired cooperation of both, the work of national integration continued to gain momentum

 See, Kamil Benso Kavoor italy ke ekikaran main jis vyakti kaa sarvaadhik yogadan tha, uskaa naam count camilo di caboor tha
 He was an important and skilled diplomatist of his era

 main turine ke ek jameendaar parivaar main hua tha
 He started his life as a soldier, but later abandoned him
 vah vaid rajasatta kaa samarthak tha or england kii sansadeey pranali se prabhavit tha
 His influence in the country gradually increased
 1848 i
 main vah desh kii sansad kaa sadsy bana
 On the strength of his ability, he became the Prime Minister of Piedmont in 1852 AD
 pradhanmantri banate hi usne peedmant kii unnati kii ore vishesh dhyaan diya
 He was a practical and determined man
 usne paristhitiyon ke anusaar kaary karke italy ke ekkiran ke kaary ko sambhav banaaya
 Cabur believed that unless the state was strong, it would not succeed in its struggles
 isliye sarvapratham usne peedmant ko ekikaran kaa netritv pradaan karne ke liye use majboot banane kaa prayaas kiya
 With a view to strengthening the state, it implemented many reforms
 vyapaar or vyavsaay ke vikaas liye uske dwaara vishesh prayaas kiye gayi
 He gave state patronage to the business, following the policy of "leave open" in the field of trade
 uske maarg-darshan main yatayaat ke sadhano ke vikaas ko majubat banaaya gaya or krishi ke kshetra ko viksit kiya gaya
 Special attention was also paid to the advancement of education
 usne sena or kanoon ke kshetra main bhi naye sudhaaron ko kriyanvit kiya
 Friendly reforms were made in the rules related to the bank
 is prakaar usne prashasan ke sabhi angon ko sudhaar kar rajya ke prashasan ko gatisheel or majboot banaaya
 Due to his efforts, the state of Piedmont grew multifaceted and now it became a strong state
 apni buniyaad ko majboot kar lene ke baad usne sabhi varg ke logon se sahyog praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya
 As a result, leaders like Mezzini and Gariboldi agreed to cooperate with him
 is prakaar rashtriya ekikaran ke kaary main vah bahusankhyak janata kaa sahyog praapt karne main safal hua
 Caboor was a sensible and practical man
 usne yah anubhav kiya ki apane lakshya kii prapti ke liye videsh sahaayta aavashyak he
 Luckily, he also succeeded in this purpose
 vah italy main austria ke prabhaav ko samaapt karne kaa icchhuk tha, kyonki iske bina vah apane uddeshyon ko praapt nahin kar saktaa tha
 It was well understood that if any European state can readily cooperate with Austria, it is France
 atah usne france ko khush karne kaa prayaas kiya
 For this he assisted France in the war of Crimea
 yah yuddh 1854 i
 main purvi samasya ke prashn lekar ladaa gaya tha
 It ended in 1856 AD by the Treaty of Paris
 paris kii sandhi par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye jis sammelan kaa aayojan kiya gaya, usamen caboor bhi upasthit hua
 He succeeded in presenting the Italian independence claim efficiently at that conference
 usne desh kii dayaneey sthiti ke liye austria ko jimmedaar tehraate hue italy se uske prabhaav ko samaapt karne kii vakaalat kii
 The arguments he gave influenced Napoleon III, then President of France, and accepted military aid to Italy, in which he had his own political advantage
 usne francisi janata ko apni mahatta se prabhavit karne kii drushti se is kaary main bhagidaar hona aavashyak samajha
 As a result, in June 1858, an agreement was reached between the two at a place called Plambiers, which was as follows- austria ko italy ke niyantran se nikaalane ke liye france italy ko sainik sahaayta degaa, or is sahaayta ke badale italy, nise or sevaay ke pradesh france ko degaa
 Thus the problem of getting foreign aid was also solved
 ab caboor austria ke khilaaf yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Having assured assurances from France, Cabour was ready to wage war against Austria
 atah caboor ke ishaare par lombardi auravenesia main austria ke khilaaf vidroh ho gaya
 Given the state of rebellion, Austria understood the imperative of war
 falswaroop 1859 i
 main donon pakshon main yuddh prarambh ha gaya
 The war was on when France suddenly withdrew from its war
 iskaa kaaran tha prashia kaa yuddh main austria kii sahaayta ke liye taiyaar hona tathaa uskaa kharchila hona
 At the same time, Napoleon felt that Italy was not appropriate for France to organize
 aisi sthiti main italy or austria bich jurik kii sandhi ho gayi, jisaki sharten is prakaar thim - Italy was not satisfied with the treaty, as it was hurting Venezia under Austria, yet the attainment of Lombardy was a major achievement in the direction of unification, although the task of unification in the central and south was still intact
 madhya-italy ke rajyon main bhi swatantraaa kii maang jor pakadaney lagi thi
 These states too were now trying to get along with the victim
 1860 i
 main modena, parama or taskani aadi madhya-italy ke rajyon ne janamat dwaara peedmant main milane kaa faisla kiya
 Thus the states of central-italy also became unified
 ab keval dakshin-italy ke rajyon ko sangathit karnaa shesh tha
 The movement to include the rest of Italy in the pied-up was not supported by any foreign power
 yah italian rashtriyata kii apni misaal thi, jiskaa netaa gariboldi tha
 The principal states of South Italy were Sicily and Naples, where the power of the Burvo-dynasty existed
 dekhen, juzappe garibaldi Gariboldi contributed significantly to Italy's national-integration work
 unka janm 1807 i
 main nise main hua tha
 He was educated in the Navy
 vah samudri vyapaar se judaa hua tha
 He was deeply influenced by Megini, which is why he became a partisan of the Republican Party

 After his failure in the revolution, he went back to America
 vahaan se khub dhan kamakar vah punah italy aayaa
 He kept in touch with Caboor and Victor Emmanuel
 apane netritv main usne lalkurti dal kaa sanghathan kiya, jiske sahyog se vah sicily or neples ko swatantra kar unhen rashtriya-dhara se jodne main safal hua
 Gariboldi did the work of connecting these states into the national stream
 dakshin-italy main sicily or neples do rajya the, jahaan burvo-vansh kaa shashan tha
 The people here revolted against the existing regime and prayed to Gariboldi for cooperation
 jawaab main gariboldi ne apni sena kii sahaayta se june 1860 i
 tak saare sicily par apana adhikaar kar liya
 This work was done easily
 sicily ab peedmant ke rajya main shaamil kar liya gaya
 After this, he also took control of Naples in 1860 AD
 6 sitambar 1860 i

 He edited both these works, influenced by his love of country and nationalism

 After this achievement, Kabur died on 6 June 1861 AD
 italy ko ek raashtra kaa rup dene kaa shrey caboor ko he, jisamen mejini, gairaboldi or victor emanuel kaa sahyog ullekhneey tha
 Cabur desired that Rome be the capital of United Italy, but had not yet joined Italy
 iske atiriktvenesia bhi abhi tak austria ke adhikaar main tha
 Thus these two shortcomings were still remaining in the work of unification of Italy
 german rajyon ke ekikaran kaa kaary prasha ke pradhanmantri ke netritv main chal rahaa tha
 For the completion of this work, Prasha made war against Austria in 1866 AD, in which Italy also joined on behalf of Prasha
 antat prasha is yuddh main safal hua
 For this cooperation Italy's state of Italy was received
 oktober 1866 i

 The ancient splendor of Rome was a source of pride for the Italians

 In 1870, a war broke out between France and Prussia
 aisi sthiti main france ko rome main sthit apni sena ko waapas bulaanaa padaa
 During the period of the reunification of Germany, this war was fought on the plain of Sidan, in which Prasha achieved the ultimate success
 is sthiti ne rome par akraman karne ke liye italy ko anukool avasar pradaan kiya, jiskaa laabh uthaakar usne rome par akraman kar diya
 On 20 September 1870, the Italian commander Kedoni established Italy's authority over Rome
 is prakaar italysiyon kii yah antim ichha bhi purna ho gayi
 On 2 June 1871, Victor Emanuel entered Rome
 italy kii sansad kaa udghaatan karte hue usne kaha, Thus the great work of unification of Italy was completed

 Gandhi and her rivals, the central Congress leadership for succession after 1965, many states and state congress organizations were forced to remove upper-caste leaders and replace the backward castes to collect votes of those castes

 Gandhi had already been accused of authoritarian conduct

 He twice declared states ruled by opposition parties as "lawless and chaotic" and took control of them by imposing President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution

 BGP · DHCP · DNS · FTP · HTTP · IMAP · IRC · LDAP · MGCP · NNTP · NTP · POP · RIP · RPC · RTP · SIP · SMTP · SNMP · SOCKS · SSH · Telnet · TLS / SSL · XMPP · TCP · UDP · DCCP · SCTP · RSVP · ECN · IP · ICMP · icmpv6 · IGMP · ipsec · domen naam agar saadhaaran shabdo me kaha jaae to bo naam jo kisi website ke link ke saath aid hota he jaise vikipedia ek naam or jo 
com he ye ek domen he In place of the numerical address of a machine on the network, the readable names of humans are in circulation even before TCP / IP
 yah prachlan arpanet yug kaa he
 a different system was then used
 DNS kaa avishkaar 1983 main TCP / IP ke sheeghra baad hi kiya gaya
 In the old system, a computer named HOSTS
TXT received a file from each computer located on the SRI on the network
 HOSTS
TXT fil main dhunde gayi naamon kaa sankhyatmak pataa hota tha
 On modern operating systems even today, a host file exists either by default or via setting and allows users to set an IP address and a host name without checking DNS
 
 host filon par aadhaarit system kii kuch moolbhoot simaaen hai, kyonki yah ek spasht aavashyaktaa he ki jab bhi computer kaa IP pataa badale to usase sampark karne kii koshish karne vaale computaron ko bhi isaki host fil se apadet karne kii aavashyaktaa padegi
 The development of networking required a more reliable system that recorded the change of address in the host in only one place
 Other hosts will receive information about this change themselves through an information system that will allow access to all host names and their respective IP addresses
 jon postel ke anurodh par, paul mokapetris ne 1983 main pehali domen naam pranali kaa avishkaar kiya or ise lagu karne kaa dhang likhaa
 mul vyakhya RFC 882 or RFC 883 main dikhaai gayi he jinhen navambar 1987 main RFC 1034 or RFC 1035 se badla gaya
 An extension of the original DNS protocol has been proposed upon receiving several additional requests for comment
 1984 main, chaar barkale main padhane vaale chaatro duglas terry, mark painter, david rigal or sonia jhou ne pehla UNIX karyanvan likhaa jise baad main ralf campbell dwaara puraa kiya gaya
 In 1985, Kevin Dunlap of the DEC re-wrote the DNS implementation and renamed it BIND, which meant the Berkeley Internet Name Domain
 Since then Mike Carell, Phil Elmquist and Paul Vixie have kept BIND alive
 1990 ke dashak ke armbh main BIND ko windos NT manch par sthapit kiya gaya
 BIND is widely distributed, especially on Unix systems, and is the most effective DNS software used on the Internet
 atyadhik upyog or iske mukt strot code kii jaanch ke parinamswaroop, saath hi saath teji se or adhik parishkrut hamale ke tareekon kii vajah se BIND main kai suraksha khamiyaan pai gayi
 This led to the development of several alternative name server and resolver programs
 BIND ko scrtch se sanskaran 9 main punah likhaa gaya jiskaa suraksha record duusare aadhunik internet software se tulana yogya he
 The domain name space contains a tree of domain names
 vriksh ke prayek node yaa pattee main shunya yaa adhik risource record hote hai, jo domen naam ke saath sambhddha jaankaree rakhte he
 The tree is divided into zones from the beginning in the root zone
 ek DNS zone main isse jude hue node kaa ek sangrah hota he jo aadhikarik taur par ek aadhikarik nem sarwar dwaara bheja jaataa he
 Administrative responsibility of any zone can be divided by which additional zones are created
 aam taur par ek up-domen ke rup main puraane spes ke ek hisse ke liye adhikaar duusare nem sarwar or prashasnic ikai ko saunpe za sakate hai
 The old zone is not authorized for the new zone
 ek domen naam aamtaur par do yaa adhik bhaagon se bana hota he, jinhen paaramparik taur par dot se alag kiya jaataa he jaise example
com
 The domain name system is controlled by a distributed database system, which uses the client-server model
 is databes ke node naam sarwar hai
 Each domain or subdomain is one or more official DNS servers that make information about the domain and the name servers of any domain subject to it public
 shrankhal main sheersh par root nemsarwar hai : sheersh str domen naam dekhte samay inase poochtacha kii jaati he
 The client end of DNS is called DNS resolver
 yah maangon ko shuru karne tathaa unhen krambaddh karne ke liye jimmevaar he jisase risource kaa purna hal kiya jaataa he jaise domen naam kaa IP pate ke rup main anuwaad
 a DNS query can be either a non-recursive query or a recursive query: risolver yaa risolver ke sthaan par punaravarti kar rahaa anya DNS sarwar queri hader main bits ke prayog dwaara punaravarti seva ke upyog kii baatcheet karata he
 This resolving typically passes between several name servers to get the information needed
 haalanki, kuch risolver saral dhang se kaary karte hai or keval ek naam sarwar ke saath hi sampark kar sakate hai
 These simple resolvers rely on a recursive name server to retrieve information
 ek domen naam main kai naam ghatak ho sakate hai
 In practice, the entire hostname often consists of only three components: eg ahost
inadomain
example, and most often www
 Inadomain
example
 For interrogation purposes, the software interprets the segment from right to left of the segment
 maarg main har kadam par, yah program ek DNS sarwar se agle sarwar kaa sanket bataane kaa aagrah karata he jisase ise paraamarsh karnaa chahie
 As originally envisaged, the process is very simple: chitra asli host www
wikipedia
org ke liye is prakriya ko dikhaata he
 The mechanism in this simple form is a tricky one: it places a heavy burden on the originating server, as every search for an address triggers an interrogation with each server
 ek system kii sampoorn karypranali main mahatvapurn hone ke naate, prayek din main arabon prashnon kaa boj ek durgam aadchan paidaa karegaa
 In practice caching is used to overcome this problem and in fact, the root name server has to cope with a very small portion of the total traffic
 dailygation main naam sarwar IP pate se soochibaddh hone kii bajaae naam se pradarshit hote hai
 This means that a resolving name server must send another DNS request to find the IP address of a specified server
 chunki is vajah se circular nirbharta kii sthiti ho sakati he, yadi ek domen ke tahat ek nem sarwar ko nirdisht kiya jaye jo iske adheen he, to yah aavashyak he ki aise maamle main nem sarwar dailygation ko agle nem sarwar kaa IP pataa bhi avashya pradaan kare
 yah record ek glu record kehalaata he
 For example, suppose that the sub-domains are more sub-domains of en
wikipedia
org and that their official name server is ns1
something
en
wikipedia
org
 ek computer jo ns1
something
en
wikipedia
org ko dhundne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he, use pehle something
en
wikipedia
org ko dhundne kaa prayaas karnaa hoga
 Since Ns1 is also under something
en
wikipedia
org subdomain, to find ns1
something
en
wikipedia
org one has to find something
en
wikipedia
org which is definitely a circular dependency, like That is stated above
 is nirbharta ko en
wikipedia
org ke nem sarwar ke glu record dwaara toda jaataa he jo ki anurodhakarta ko sidhe hi ns1
something
en
wikipedia
org kaa IP pataa pradaan karata he jo ns1
somethingen
wikipedia
org ko bootstrap prakriya dwaara dhundne kii prakriya ke liye sakasham banaata he
 Because the amount of requests generated by a system like DNS is huge, the designers decided to provide a mechanism to reduce the burden on each DNS server
 aaj tak, DNS resolution prakriya ek safal jawaab ke baad ek di gayi avadhi tak kaishing ke liye anumati detii he
 The length of time a DNS resolver caches a DNS response is determined by a value called the life time of the response
 titiel DNS pratikriya baahar saunpane vaale sarwar ke administrator dwaara tay kiya jaataa he
 The validity of the duration can range from a few seconds to days or even a few weeks
 is vitarit or kaishing sanrachana ke ek ullekhneey parinaam ke rup main, DNS record main parivartan hameshaa turant or duniya bhar main prabhavi nahin hote
 ise ek udhaaharan ke madhyam se acchhee tarah se spasht kiya za saktaa he : yadi kisi administrator ne host www
wikipedia
org ke liye 6 ghante kaa titiel set kiya he or iske baad IP pataa jisamen 12:01pm par www
wikipedia
org ko dhundha janaa he, administrator ko yah sochna chahie ki vah vyakti jisane 12:00 baje dopaher main puraane ypi pate se ek pratikriya ko kaishd kiya hoga, vah 6:00pm tak DNS sarwar se sampark nahin kar sakegaa
 In this example the period between 12:01 pm and 6:00 pm is called the caching time, which is best defined as a time that starts when you make changes to the DNS record and then ends Occurs when the maximum time limit specified by TTL is reached
 dnes main parivartan karte samay ise ek mahatvapurn taarkik soch ke rup main dekha jaataa he : yah aavashyak nahin ki prayek vaa dekh rahaa ho jo aap dekh rahe hai
 RFC 1912 helps to explain the basic rules for establishing TTL
 shabd "prasar" par dhyaan den haalanki yah is sandarbh main bahut vyapak rup se prayukt hota he, acchhee tarah se kaishing ke prabhaav kaa varnan nahin karata he
 Specifically, this means that when you make a DNS change, it somehow spreads to other DNS servers and that you have no control over the amount of time of the cached record
 kuch risolver titiel mulyon ko bhi paar kar jate hai kyonki protocol kaishing ke liye 68 saal tak yaa bilkul kaishing nahin, kaa samarthan karata he
 Negative caching is determined by the authorized name servers of a zone in which the start of authority record must be specified when no data is available for reporting in response to the request
 SOA ricard ke nunatam kshetra or khud SOA ke titiel kaa prayog nakaaratmak jawaab ke liye titiel sthapit karne main hota he
 RFC 2308 jab aap ek DNS main parivartan karte hai to bahut se log galat tareeke se rahasyamay 48 ghante yaa 72 ghante ko prachaar samay maanate hai
 If someone changes the DNS record of a domain or changes the IP address of the host names of the authorized DNS servers of a domain, all DNS servers may take a long time before using the new information
 yah isliye hai kyonki wo record zone parent DNS sarvaron, dwaara niyantrit kiye ja rahe hai jo aam taur par 48 ghante ke liye un record ko cash karte hai
 However, these DNS changes will be immediately available to any DNS server that may not have cached them
 or aapke domen par NS record or adhikrut DNS sarwar naam ke alaava koi bhi DNS parivartan lagbhag turant hoga, yadi aap aise karnaa chaahate hai
 
 "reverse lukup" shabd die gayi IP pate se jude naam ko khojane ke liye DNS poochtacha ko sanderbhit karata he
 DNS stores IP addresses in particular domains as PTR records
 ipv4 ke liye, domen in-addr
arpa he
 For ipv6, the reverse lookup domain is ip6
arpa
 reverse lukup kii prakriya karte samay, DNS client pate ko DNS main prayukt praaroop main badal detaa he, tathaa iske baad hameshaa kii tarah delygation shrankhla kaa paalan karata he
 For example, the ipv4 address '208
80
152
2' changes to 2
152
80
208
in-addr
arpa
 DNS risolver kii poochtacha root sarvaron se hoti he jo 208
in-addr
arpa zone ke liye ARIN sarwar kii ore sanket karata he
 From there Wikimedia servers have been appointed for 152
80
208
in and PTR completes the lookup by querying the Wikimedia nameservers for 2
152
80
208
in-addr
arpa, resulting in an official result
 upyogkarta aam taur par sidhe ek DNS risolver ke saath sampark nahin karte
 iske bajaay DNS resolution aplicoshan program main paardarshee dhang se jagah banaata he jaise ki web brouzar, i mail graahak or anya internet aplicoshan / program
 program aplicoshan ke ek aise anurodh jiske liye domen nem lukup kii aavashyaktaa he, aise program resolution anurodh ko sthaneey oparating system main DNS risolver ko bhejte hai jo badale main aavashyak sanchaar niyantrit karata he
 The DNS resolver almost always contains a cache / collection of recently used lookup
 yadi cash anurodh kaa uttar de paae to risolver cash kaa uttar anurodh karne vaale program ko degaa
 If the cache does not contain an answer, the resolver will send the request to one or more specified DNS servers
 zyaadaatar gharelu upyogkartaaon ke maamle main, internet seva pradaata jisase mashin sampark sthapit karti he, aam taur par is DNS sarwar kii aapurti karata he: aise upyogkarta kaa sarwar pataa manual rup se configar hoga yaa DHCP ko nirdhaarit karne kii anumati degaa, lekin jahaan system administrator dwaara apane DNS sarwar prayog karne ke liye system configar kiye gayi hai, unka DNS risolver sanghathan ke alag rakhe gayi nem sarwar kii ore sanket karata he
 Under any circumstances, the name server to be queried will follow the procedure given above until it successfully detects or cannot detect the result
 tab yah apana parinaam DNS risolver ko yah maanate hue bhej detaa he ki isane uttar dhund liya he, risolver uttar ko bhavishya ke liye kaishd kar letaa he or uttar ko us softver ke paas vaapis bhej detaa he jisane shuruyaat main prashn poocha tha
 An additional level of complexity emerges when the resolver violates the rules of the DNS protocol
