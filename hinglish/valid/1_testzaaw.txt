 International relations is the study of relations between different countries, as well as the role of sovereign states, inter-governmental organizations, international ngos, non-governmental organizations and multinationals
 anterrashtriya sambandh ko kabhi-kabhi 'antararashtriya adhyayan' ) ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, haalanki donon shabd puri tarah se paryaay nahin hai
 In simple terms, 'international politics' means 'doing politics among states'
 yadi 'raajnneeti' ke arth kaa adhyayan karen to teen pramukh tatv saamne aate hai - samoohon kaa astitv; samoohon ke bich sahmati; tathaa samoohon dwaara apane hiton kii purti
 If we assess this effect internationally, then these three elements are mainly - the existence of states; Conflict between states; And the use of power to fulfill their national interests
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti un kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa he jiske antargat rajya apane raashtra hiton kii purti hetu shakti ke aadhaar par sangharshrat rahete hai
 In this context, national interests are the main goals of international politics; Conflict sets its direction; And Shakti is considered as the main means of achieving this objective
 parantu uparyukt paribhaasha ko ham paramparaagat maan sakate hai, kyonki aaj ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ kaa sthaan isse vyapak avadharana ‘antarrashtriya sambandhon’ ne le liya he
 Under this, along with mutual conflict of states, the collaborative aspects are now studied under international politics
 iske atirikt aaj ‘rajyon’ ke alaava anya kai kaarak bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ban gaye hai
 Therefore, under this, individuals, institutions, organizations and many other non-state units have also joined
 iskaa vartmaan aadhaar va vishay kshetra aaj kaaphi vyapak swaroop le chukaa he
 Before discussing all these topics, it becomes very essential to review the following definitions given by different scholars- in paribhaashaon kaa dayera ati simit he, kyonki iske antargat multah ‘rajyon’ ko hi anterrashtriya raajnneeti ke kaarak ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is limited to the nature of international politics
 mukhya rup se hence je
 margenthau, herald spraoot, bone doyak, thampsan aadi iske mukhya samarthak hai jo inaki nimna paribhaashaon se spasht ho jaataa he- International definitions discuss the broad nature of international politics, international relations
 isamen rajya ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke naveen karkon jaise antarrashtriya sanghathan, deshaantar samooh, gaiyr sarkari sanghathan, antarrashtriya santhaayen, kuch vyaktiyon aadi ko bhi sammilit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, along with the struggle, cooperation and politics, as well as directly or indirectly affecting it, ie, cultural, religious, social, science and technical aspects are also mentioned
 vibhinn lekhakon kii nimnlikhit paribhaashaon se yah aashay ati spasht rup main ujagar ho jaataa he- In this way the nature of international politics becomes very broad from the beginning to the present
 isamen aaj raashtra rajyon ke saath vibhinn vishwa ikaayiyon evam sanghathanon ke adhyayan kaa samavesh ho chukaa he
 But even after all these changes, the focal point of these studies is still a nation state
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ke bare main nimna nishkarsh saamne aate hai
 Therefore, the nature of international politics is variable
 jab-jab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke parivesh, karkon va ghatnakram main parivartan aayegaa, iske adhyayan karne ke tareekon va drushtikonon main bhi parivartan anivaary he
 Additionally, this change is continuous rather than permanent
 iske saath-saath vibhinn karkon, staron, ayaamon aadi ke kaaran yah bahut jatil he atah iske sucharu adhyayan hetu bahut spasht, tarksangat, vyapak drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As is known from the above definitions and form, the subject area of international politics is increasing
 aaj iskaa vishay kshetra kaaphi vyapak ho gaya he jiske antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- Therefore, today the subject area of international politics is very broad and complex and is moving towards development
 iske antargat vibhinn paramparaagat karkon ke saath-saath gaiyr-paramparaagat karkon kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn hota ja rahaa he
 The history of the development of international politics is not very ancient, rather the subject is a product of the twentieth century
 spasht rup se dekha jaae to velj vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya woodro wilson peeth kii 1919 main sthapana se hi iskaa itihaas prarambh hota he

 Therefore, if we look at the history of this subject in the last one century, then along with the ups and downs in this subject, information about its establishment in an autonomous subject is available
 is vishay main aaye bahuaiami parivartanon ne jahaan ek ore vishaywastu kaa sanvardhan, samanvay tathaa vikaas kiya he, vahiin duusari ore vibhinn siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke bahut si jatil samasyaon evam pahaluon ko samajhane main sahaayta pradaan kii he
 Kenneth Thompson in his 1962 review, Review of Politics, has divided the history of international politics into four parts, on the basis of which a clear and sure study of this subject can be possible
 vikaas ke in chaar charnon main shityudhottar yug ke paanchaven charan ko bhi sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their detailed description is as follows: pratham vishwayuddh se purv itihaas, kanoon, raajnneeti shaastra, darshan shaastra aadi ke vidwaan hi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke alag-alag pahaluon par vichaar karte the
 It was mainly historians who studied it as diplomatic history and the history of relations with other countries
 iske antargat kootneetigyon va videsh mantriyon dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kaa lekha jokha hota tha
 Hence, it is also known as diplomatic history
 i
ech
car ke anusaar pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh kaa sambandh keval sainikon tak samajha jaataa tha tathaa iske samakaksh antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa sambandh rajanyikon tak
 In addition, even in democratic countries, foreign policy was traditionally kept separate from party politics and the elected members also felt unable to control the foreign ministry
 1919 se purv is vishay ke prati udaseenta ke kai pramukh kaaran the - pratham, is samay tak yahi samajha jaataa tha ki yuddh va rajyon main gathbandhan usee prakaar swaabhaavik he jaise garibi va berogari
 Therefore, preventing war, foreign policy and mutual relations between states was considered out of the control of human power
 dwitiya, pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh itane bhayankar nahin hote the
 Third, in the absence of means of communication, international politics was limited to a few states
 is prakaar is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan kii sabase badi kami saamaanya hiton kaa vikaas rahaa
 In this period, only a descriptive study of diplomatic history was done
 parinamswaroop, isse na to vartmaan tathaa na hi bhavi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane main koi madad mili
 The quantum achievement of this era was the establishment of the Chair of the Study of International Politics at the University of Wales in 1919
 do vishwa yudhon ke bich ke kaal main do samaanaantar dhaaraon kaa vikaas hua
 The first of which emphasized the study of current events / problems, except for the dominance of earlier historicity
 iske saath saath ab aitihaasik raajnneetik adhyayan ko vartmaan raajnneetik sandarbhon ke saath jod kar dekhne kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 Despite the diminishing of historical influence, there still remains a lack of a holistic approach to the study of international politics
 is kaal main vartmaan ke adhyayan par to bahut bal diya gaya, lekin vartmaan evam ateet ke parsparik sambandh ke mahatv ko abhi bhi pahachaanaa nahin gaya
 In addition, neither was there an attempt to see post-war political problems with comparable problems of the past
 shaayad isiilie is yug main bhi do moolbhoot kamiyaan spasht rup se ujagar raheen
 First, like the first phase, universal principles could not develop in international politics even in this period
 dwitiya, aaj bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa adhyayan adhik suspasht evam tarksangat nahin ban paaya
 Thus, in this phase, there was not much change in the study of international politics except the change in the status of force, nor was the confirmation of this subject becoming an explicitly independent discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa tritiy charan bhi dwitiya charan ke samaanaantar do vishwa yudhon ke bich kaa kaal rahaa
 It is called the era of reformism because it envisaged reform of international politics through the establishment of the League of Nations by the states
 is yug main mukhya rup se sansthagat vikaas kiya gaya
 The scholars, diplomats, politicians and thinkers of this period believed that if international institutions are developed, then the problems of war and peace present in front of the world community will be possible
 is uddeshy hetu kuch kanoonee va naitik upagamon kii sanrachanaayen kii gai jinke nimna mukhya aadhaar the
 International organization was envisaged with emphasis on these ideals and moral values
 isaki sthapana ke uparant yah mana gaya ki ab antarrashtriya sambandhon main rajyon ke madhya shaanti banane kaa sangharsh samaapt ho gaya
 There will be no place of balance of power under the new system
 ab rajya apane vivaadon kaa nipataara sangh ke madhyam se karenge
 Therefore, in this era not only the problems of war and peace were discussed, but its far-reaching reforms were also thought of
 atah adhyayankartaaon ke mukhya bindu bhi kanoonee samasyaon va sanghathanon ke vikaas ke saath-saath inke madhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ko badalane vaala rahaa
 Finally, in this period more emphasis has been laid on emotional, imaginative and moral reformism
 parantu vishwayudhon ke bich in upagamon kii sarthakata par hameshaa prashn chihn laga rahaa
 While the first decade of United Nations activities showed a ray of hope, the economic situation of the second decade completely ended this notion
 badi shaktiyon ke madhya asahyog va gutbandiyon ne shaanti kii sthapana kii bajaay shakti sangharsh vyavastha ko janm diya
 While Japan invaded Manchuria and disrupted peace, Italy, Germany and Russia not only relinquished membership of the League in controversial situations, but also intensified the process of the start of World War II

 The fundamental changes in international politics at this stage not only broadened its content but also led to many complications
 shitayugin kaal main raajnneeti ke swaroop main parivartan tathaa naye rajyon ke udai ne sampoorn antarrashtriya parivesh ko hi badal diya
 As a result, new approaches, dimensions, institutions and trends were created through which the study of international relations was ensured
 purv charnon kii aadarshik, sansthagat, naitik, kanoonee evam sudhaarwadi dhaaraon kii asafalataaon ne naye upagamon ke vikaas kii ore agrasar kiya
 This new approach was realism
 vaise to i

 margenthau ne ise ek saamaanya siddhanth ke rup main prastut kiya
 According to this theory, states are always struggling to fulfill their interests
 atah anterrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane hetu is shakti sangharsh ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhnaa ati aavashyak he
 International organization also originated in the form of assured and unambiguous development of international institutions with realistic outlook
 ab is sanghathan kaa swaroop maatra adarshavaadi va sudhaarwadi na hokar, mahatvapurn raajnneetik sanghathan ke rup main ubhar kar aayaa
 Under this, apart from saving mankind from the ravages of war, what are the reasons for the conflict between the states? What are the risk factors for world peace? How can peace be established? How can arms race be stopped? Efforts were also made to find solutions to many types of questions
 uparokt do pravritiyon ke saath-saath vyavahaarwad kii utpatti bhi is yug kii mahatvapurn uplabdhi rahi
 An attempt was made to understand international politics by creating "system theory" through a pragmatic approach
 is upaagam ke antargat rajyon ke adhyayan hetu teen pramukh karkon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa zaruri mana gaya
 These factors were- uparokt pravritiyon kaa mukhya bal antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saiddhantikaran ko badhaava dena rahaa he
 Therefore, it has been a very important task in this era to propose the universal principles of international politics
 siddhanth nirmaan kii is prakriya ke parinaam swaroop anek aanshik siddhanton jaise - yatharthwaad, santulan kaa siddhanth, sanchaar siddhanth, krida siddhanth, saudebaaji kaa siddhanth, shaanti anusandhan drushtikon, vyavastha siddhanth, vishwa vyavastha pratimaan aadi kaa nirmaan hua
 Despite the rendering of these principles, there still remains a lack of any universal and common principle in this era
 1990 ke dashak main jaint bandhopadhyaay ne apni pustak - general theory of international rilations - main martin kaplan ke vyavasthaaparak siddhanth kii kamiyon ko dur kar ek saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana kii koshish kii he, parantu vah bhi abhi vaad-pratwaad ke daur main hi hai
 Therefore, despite the main phase of theorization, the era of the Cold War remained deprived of any one general principle due to its ideological narrowness and isolation
 shityudhottar yug main sabhi rashtron dwaara ek aarthik vyavastha ke antargat judana prarambh kar diya
 That is why the era of globalization, liberalization, free market system etc
 has started
 is sandarbh main na keval aarthik muddon kaa hi mahatv badha, apitu antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa mahatv or bhi bad gaya
 Today, the distinction of nationalism and internationalism has ended
 Apart from this, now the table of international politics has included a lot of new topics which, instead of being national, now emerge as problems of mankind
 vartmaan vishwa kii pramukh samasyaon main aatankwaad, paryaavaran, ozon parat ksheen hona, nashile padaarthon evam maadak dravyon kii taskari, maanavadhikaron kaa hanan aadi pramukh mudde ubhar kar saamne aaye jinka rashtriya str yaa kshetray str kii bajaay antarrashtriya str par hal nikaalnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 Even at the theoretical level, the attempt to establish the universal principle from 1945 to 1991 got a shock
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii is sandarbh main ab praathamiktaayen badal gai
 In post-modernism, the significance of universal principles are now being questioned
 aitihaasik sandarbh evam pracheen parivesh ke prabhaav ko bhi nakaara ja rahaa he
 Now the independent issues have become more important
 vrihat siddhanth gaun ho gaye hai
 Partial research has become more important in the new context
 udhaahranswaroop nariwad, maanavadhikaar, paryaavaran aadi vishyon par adhik bal dene ke saath-saath chintan bhi prarambh ho gaya he
 Therefore, in the post-cold War era, the nature, content and subject area of international politics have completely changed
 ab saamaanya saiddhanthik sthapana par bhi adhik bal nahin diya ja rahaa he
 That is why, in this changed environment, international politics seems to be not only important but also towards autonomy
 or vishay kii swaittata hetu ashaavadi sanket dikhaai dete hai
 The Second World War not only influenced international politics fundamentally, but also expressed many important issues
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke karkon main parivartan, karkon ko vyapak swaroop pradaan karnaa, naveen siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aadi anek vishyon ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa purna parivesh hi badal kar rakh diya he
 While there is a debate on the theoretical level of realism and idealism on the one hand, and on the ancient and scientific debate, on the other hand controversial questions were being raised about the format of international relations topic - whether international relations is a Autonomous subject or not? Although it is being taught as an autonomous subject at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and research in most universities today, it is not recognized as equivalent to other subjects of social science
 itnaa avashya hua he ki viksit deshon main to kai vishvavidhyalayon main ise purna rup se swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Developing countries like India have also improved
 yahaan prarambh main ‘bhartiya antarrashtriya sambandh skool, nai dilli’ jo baad main jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya sambandh skool ke rup main swytt rup se kaary kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, many other universities like Jadavpur University, Calcutta, Goa University etc
 have also got the status of autonomous subjects
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ko ek swytt vishay ke rup main adhyayan karne se purv ek baat spasht kerani ati aavashyak he ki jab ham is vishay kii swaittata ke prashn kaa adhyayan karte hai to ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ va antarrashtriya sambandhon ko alag-alag vishay nahin maanate hai
 This has been done because both disciplines are still recognized as a sub-discipline of the subject of political science rather than as an autonomous discipline
 duusare inkaa vibhed itnaa sookshm he ki anushaasan kii swaittata kii pramanikta ke baad is vishay ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the context of considering international politics as an autonomous subject, three different views have been given which are as follows - jo vidwaan is vishay ko swytt maanate hai unke anusaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay vastu va anushaasan sambandhi saamagree ko dekhte hue ise ek swytt vishay mana janaa chahie
 The main proponents of this argument are - CAW
 Manning, Quincy Right, Robert Lotting Allen, Hannes J
 Margenthau, Carl M
 Copper Johnson, Hoffmann; AL Burn etc
 in vidwaanon ne nimna aadhaaron par ise swytt vishay pramanit kiya he- Those scholars who do not consider international politics as an autonomous subject, believe that there is no such unique thing in this subject that it should be considered autonomous for study
 unhone nimna tarko ke aadhaar par apni baat kaa samarthan kiya he- Some scholars consider both of the above debates as meaningless
 unka maananaa yah he ki uparyukt donon tarkon ko antarrashtriya raajnneeti main hue vikaas ke madhyam se adhik bhalee prakaar se janaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, a review of the development of the 20th century, and especially after 1945, is extremely essential
 yadi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii swaittata ke prashn kaa gahan adhyayan karte hai to pataa chalata he ki is sandarbh main do moolbhoot samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 One, there have been effective changes in the nature, content and methods of international relations
 doosraa, isi samay raajnneetishastra kii paridhi kii jatiltaaon evam aparibhaashit simaaon ke vikaas ke kaaran samasya or bad gai he
 But if we look at the development of international politics from 1919 till date, it is clear that its achievements will prove very helpful in giving it autonomy
 1919 ke baad se hi, visheshkar america main, bahut se vidwaanon ne is vishay ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane hetu prayaas kiye hai
 Efforts have also been made to explain its content, methods and principles

 After a review in this context, Richard Smythbeel has come to the conclusion that- dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad is sthiti main mahatvapurn parivartan aae hai
 On the one hand, on the one hand, based on new researches in this field, the international relations analytic relations have been strengthened, on the other hand new theories have also been formulated
 america main anek viddhanon mukhya rup se margenthau, richard snidar, martin kaplan, karl dablyoo dois, charles mekalaland aadi ne is ore vishisht yogadan diya he
 In addition, emphasis has been laid on the study of both developed and developing countries
 isaki vishay saamagree kaa sankalan, siddhanth pratipaadan evam paddatiyon kaa bhi kaaphi vikaas hua he
 But even today, the most important deficiency remains the lack of a universal / general principle
 shityudhottar vishwa main iskaa mahatv or bad gaya he
 In this era of globalization, all the states are getting connected with one type of economic system
 antarrashtriya va rashtriya mudde jaise paryaavaran, aatankwaad, nariwad, adj, ozon parat ksheen hona, maanavadhikaar aadi rashtriya kii bajaay maanviya / maanavjaati se sambhddha ho gaye hai
 Therefore, active participation of international forums / organizations is necessary to solve all these
 ab saarvbhaumik siddhanth ko bhi uttar aadhunikwaad kii drushti se nakaar kar vyaktiparak evam sthaneey aadhaar par adhik bal diya gaya he
 Therefore, on the basis of the development after 1945, it can be said to be leading to autonomy, which after 1991 the process of the end of the Cold War has tried to strengthen

 anndavardhan or abhinavgupt donon ne ras or dhwani kaa atoot sambandh dikhaakar raas mat kaa hi samarthan kiya tha
 Anandavardhan considers 'rasa sound' as the best sound while Abhinavagupta considers rasa-sound as 'sound' or 'expressive'

 Chauth's entire history revolves around the Chautha Mata Shakti Peetha, this village has a grand temple of Chauth Bhawani which is situated at an altitude of 1100 feet above the Aravali Shakti Giri mountain range, this temple was founded by Maharaja Bhim Singh Chauhan
 In 1451, on the mountain of Barwada
 vartmaan chouth kaa barwada ko pracheen kaal main "barbada" naam se janaa jaataa tha jo ki ranthambhore samrajya kaa hi ek hissaa rahaa he, is kshetra ke pramukh shaskaon main bijalsinh evam bhimsingh chouhan pramukh rahe hai
 Charu and Pachala near Barwada region, which have become villages in the present time, were the main places of stay of tribals in the dense forests in ancient times
 chouth mata kii pratham pratimaaka anumaan churu jangalon ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 According to a legend, in ancient times, there was the practice of a terrible fire in the Charu forests, which led to the destruction of Darud Bhairo
 is pratimaa ke chamatkaaron ko dekhakar jangal ke adivaasiyon ko pratimaa ke prati lagaav ho gaya or unhone apane kul ke aadhaar par chaur mata ke naam se isaki puja karne lage, baad me chaur mata kaa naam dhire dhire churu mata evam aage chalakar yahi naam apbhransh hokar chouth mata ho gaya
 It is known that this mother was first worshiped by the people of the Chaura ie Kanjar caste as her Kuldevi, later the tribals also considered it as their goddess Aradhya who belonged to the Meena tribe
 yahi kaaran rahaa he ki chouth mata ko adivaasiyon meenaon evam conjaron kii kuladevi ke rup main janaa jane laga
 Years later, the statue of Chauth Mata suddenly vanished from the formidable forests of Charu, the atom of which is very difficult to say correctly, but years later the same statue began to appear in the dream of Maharaja Bhim Singh Chauhan in the foothills of Barwara region, but Bhimsinh Chauhan Has ignored it
 kahan jaataa he ki ek baar maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ko raat main swapn aayaa ki shikaar khilne kii parampara ko main bhuulataa ja rahaa hoon, isi swapn kii vajah se maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ne shikaar khilne jane kaa nishchay kiya, maharaja bhimsingh chouhan barwada se sandhya ke vakt jane kaa nishchay kiya evam shikaar karne kii taiyaari karne lage
 The queen of Bhimsingh Chauhan was named Ratnavali
 kaha jaataa he ki ratnavali ne raja bhimsingh chouhan ko shikaar par nahin jane ke liye bahut manaa kiya, magar bhimsingh ne yah kahkar baat ko taal diya ki "chouhan ek baar savaar hone ke baad shikaar karke hi neeche utarate hai"
 Thus, ignoring the queen's words, Bhimsingh Chauhan along with his soldiers traveled towards the dense forests
 shaam kaa samay tha lekin bhimsingh chouhan jangalon main shikaar kii khoj hetu badhate hi rahe, yakayek maharaja bhimsingh chouhan kii nazar ek mrug par padi or unhone mrug kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya, sainik bhi raja ke saath badhane lage, lekin jangalon main raat ho jane ke kaaran sabhi sainik aapas main ek duusare se bhatak gaye
 Maharaja Bhimsingh decided to chase the deer by aiming for the voice as it became night and proceeded towards the deer
 mrug dhire dhire bhimsingh chouhan kii najaron se ojhal ho gaya
 By the time all the king's soldiers had lost their way from the king
 bhimsingh chouhan ne chaaron taraf nazren daudai magar uske paas koi bhi sainik nahin rahaa or pani ke shrout ko khojane lage kyonki unako pyaas bahut sataane lagi thi
 Even after a lot of effort, when water was not available, Bhimsingh Chauhan fainted and fell into the forests
 bhimsingh ko swapn main pachaalaa talahati main vahi pratimaa dikhne lagi
 Then suddenly it started raining fiercely and the thunder started thundering and lightning started to blow, when the rage broke due to the rain of the king, the king sees that there was water all around, the king drank the water first and saw a girl in the dark night The girl was seen playing as a bright bright hair like the sun herself
 Bhim Singh Chauhan was a little frightened to see that girl and said, o Bala, what are you doing alone in this forest? The Where is your parents, the young girl listening to the king started laughing and said in a taut voice, o Rajan, tell me whether your thirst is quenched or not, by saying so much, Bhagwati came in her true form, as soon as the king's mother came Fell at the feet and said, o Adishakti Mahamaya, i do not want anything from you, if you are happy with me, then you can always live in our area! Bhagwati Shivamaya became impassioned by saying that Raja Bhim Singh Chauhan had said that mother will fulfill her wish
 usee chouth mata kii pratimaa ko lekar raja barwada kii ore chal diya, barwada aate janata ko raja ne puraa haal bataaya or samvath 1451 main adishkti chouth bhavani kii barwada main pahaad kii chotii par magh krishna chaturthi ko vidhi vidhaan se sthapit kiya, tab se lekar aaj tak isi din chouth mata kaa mela bharta he jisamen lakhon kii taadaad main bharatvarsh se bhagat jan maan kaa aashirwad lene aate rahete he
 The above saying is still going on for Bhimsingh Chauhan: - Leave Choru and leave the rest, Barwada Dhari Malan, "bhimsingh Chauhan Ku, Ma Di Di Parchaya Atom is prakaar chouth mata ke naam par barwada kshetra aage aage chouth kaa naam jodakar maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ne is kshetra kaa nayaa naam rakh diya chouth kaa barwada
 Chauth Mata Shakti Peetha is considered to be the most famous of the Chauth's Barwada in the temples of Chauth Mata, famous in India for Suhag Puja, so it will not be an exaggeration to call Chauth's Barwada as Shakti Nagar, Chauth Mata's first place
 The second Pachala has been a village, while Samvat from 1451 to the present, this temple is located at Chauth ka Barwara
 chouth mata ko choron va conjaro kii kuladevi mana jaataa he evam adivaasiyon main meena janajati ke nareda gautra kii kuladevi ke rup main chouth mata ji ko vishesh sthaan praapt he aaj bhi meena jati ke nareda gautra main navaratri puja ke samay mata ke pratik ke rup main trishul evam nahar ke putr nareda ke rup main nahar kaa panja banaakar poojane kii pratha pracheen samay se chali aa rahi he
 According to legends, Barwal Gautra of Meena Samaj also considers Chauth Mata as his Kuldevi
