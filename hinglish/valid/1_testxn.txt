 yah paramparaagat rup se vyapak prashikshan ke baad mahilaon dwaara kiya ek ekal nrity he
 The legendary Mohini Mohiniyattam, also called Mohini Attam, is derived from the word "mohini" which is a famous female avatar of Lord Vishnu in Indian mythology
 mohini kaa arth ek "divya jaaduugarani yaa man ko mohane vaala" hota he
 The incarnation took place during the war between Dev and the Asuras when the Asuras took control of the nectar
 mohini ne wo amrit asuron ko moh main lekar devataaon ko de diya tha Mohiniyattam is an Indian classical dance whose roots are in the Pushtak Natya Shastra, considered to be the mother of Indian art

 On the atomic and sub-atomic scale, this relationship is expressed by the ratio of the rotational magnetic ratio, the magnetic moment to the angular momentum
 chumbakatv kaa mul do sroton se ubharta he: In magnetic materials, the sources of magnetism are the orbital angular momentum of the electron around the nucleus and the internal magnetic momentum of the electrons
 Other sources of magnetism are the nuclear magnetic moments of the nucleus, which are typically several thousand times smaller than the electron magnetic moments, so they are negligible in terms of magnetization of elements
 nabhik chumbakeey samveg anya sandarbhon main mahatvapurn hai, visheshkar parmaanu chumbakeey anunaad or chumbakeey anunaad pratibimban 
 Generally, a large number of electrons in a material are arranged in such a way that their magnetic moments are canceled

 donon hi maamalon main, electron vyavastha prayek electron se chumbakeey sanvegon ko bilkul radd karne ke liye he
 Furthermore, when the electron configuration is such that unpaired electrons and / or unoccupied subcells are present, it is often the case that multiple electrons in a solid contribute to magnetic moments that point in distinct, random directions, so that the material is not magnetic
 is
 lekin, kabhi kabhi - yaa to anayas yaa prayukt bahari chumbakeey kshetra ke kaaran - prayek electron chumbakeey samveg, ausatan, vyavasthit ho jate hai
 Subsequently, the material can generate a net total magnetic field, which may be quite strong
 dravya kaa chumbakeey vyavhaar uski sanrachana, visheshkar uparokt kaarnon se electron vinyas or saath hi taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 At higher temperatures, the random thermal momentum makes alignment alignment more complicated for the electron
 prati-chumbakatv sabhi dravyon main prakat hota he or prayukt chumbakeey kshetra kaa virodh karnaa tatwon kii pravriti he or isliye, chumbakeey kshetra dwaara vikarshith hona he
 However, in materials with molecular properties, the molecular behavior dominates
 is prakaar, apane saarvbhaumik upasthiti ke baavjood, prati-chumbakeey vyavhaar keval vishuddh prati-chumbakeey dravya main dekha jaataa he
 In a counter-magnetic material, there are no unpaired electrons, so internal electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect
 in maamalon main, chumbakatv electron ke kakshiya sanvegon se ubharta he, jise shastreey taur par nimnatah samajha ja saktaa he: Please note that this description is intended only as an Autodetect; Quantum-mechanical description is required for proper understanding
 dhyaan den ki sabhi dravyon ko is kakshiya pratikriya se guzarana padataa he
 However, in magnetomagnetic and ferromagnetic materials, the counter-magnetization effects are overwhelmed by the very strong effects of coupled electrons
 anuchumbakeey dravya main ayugmit electron maujuud hote hai, arthath parmaanu yaa aanvik kakshiya, jinamein keval ek electron hota he
 While the Pauli exclusion principle requires paired electrons to have their internal magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, canceling out their magnetic fields, an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic momentum in either direction
 jab ek bahya chumbakeey kshetra prayukt hota he, ye chumbakeey samveg khud ko prayukt kshetra kii disha ke anuroop sanrekhit karte hai, jisase ve prabalit hote hai
 Iron-magnets have unpaired electrons according to molecular-magnetic matter

 Thus, even when removing the applied field, the electrons in the material maintain a parallel orientation
 prayek louh-chumbakeey padaarth kaa apana vyaktigat taapmaana hota he, jo curi taapmaana yaa curi bindu kehalaata he, jisase upar vah apane louh-chumbakeey gunon ko kho detaa he
 This is because the thermal tendency of the disorder suppresses energy-reduction due to the iron-magnetic sequence
 kuch jane-maane louh-chumbakeey dravya jo aasaani se pahachaane jane vaale chumbakeey gunon ko pradarshit karte hai, ve hai nikal, loha, cobalt, gadolinium or unke mishra dhaatu
 The magnetic moments of atoms in an iron-magnetic material force them to behave like small permanent magnets
 ve ek saath jude rahete hai or chumbakeey domen yaa veis domen kahalaane vaale kamobesh ekarup sanrekhan vaale chote kshetron main sanrekhit kar lete hai
 The magnetic domain can be viewed through a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that look similar to the white lines in the image
 kai vaigyanik prayog maujuud hai joki bhautik rup se chumbakeey kshetra dikhaa sakate hai
 When the domain consists of many molecules, it becomes unstable and aligns in well-organized domains in two opposite directions so that they are connected to each other with greater stability to the right and as shown
 jab chumbakeey kshetra ke sampark main hon, domen simaaen gatisheel hoti hai taaki chumbakeey kshetra se sanrekhit domenon main vruddhi ho or bain ore dikhaae gaye anusaar sanrachana par haaavee ho saken

 iske parinamswaroop louh-chumbakeey dravya chumbakeey ho jaataa he, jisase sthai chumbak ban jaataa he
 When the magnetic field is sufficiently strong so that the existing domain covers all the rest in a single domain, the material is magnetically saturated
 jab chumbakeey louh-chumbakatv dravya ko curi bindu taapmaana tak garam kiya jaataa he, to anuon main us bindu tak halchal much jaati he ki chumbakeey domen kaa sanghathan bikhar jaataa he or unke dwaara vyutpann chumbakeey gun khatm ho jate hai
 When the material is cooled, the alignment structure of this domain spontaneously returns as the fluid freezes into a crystalline solid
 lauhachumbakatv se ulate prati-lauhachumbakatv main vipareet dishaao main suchit karne ke liye aas-paas ke karshanshakti vaale electronon main aantarik chumbakeey samveg kii pravriti hoti he
 When all atoms are arranged in matter so that each neighbor is 'per-aligned', the substance is anti-ferromagnetic
 prati-lauhachumbakon main shunya nival chumbakeey samveg hota he, jiskaa arth he unke dwaara koi kshetra nirmit nahin hota he
 Anti-ferromagnets are less common than other types of behavior and can be observed mostly at low temperatures
 alag-alag taapamanon main, prati-lauhachumbakon dwaara prati-chumbakeey or louh-chumbakeey gunon ko pradarshit karte hue dekha ja saktaa he
 In some fluids, neighboring electrons want to point in opposite directions, but there is no geometric arrangement in which each neighboring pair is counter-aligned
 ise spin glass kaha jaataa he or yah jyamitiya hataasha kaa ek udhaaharan he
 Similar to iron-magnetism, iron magnets retain their magnetism in the absence of field
 tathaapi, prati-lauhachumbakon kii bhaanti, electron prachakranon ke padosi yugma vipareet dishaao main ingit karte hai
 These two properties are not contradictory, because in the optimal geometrical arrangement, there is more magnetic momentum from the electrons pointing in one direction, than in the pointers pointing in the opposite direction
 pehle khoja gaya chumbakeey padaarth magnetic, multah louh-chumbak mana gaya tha; tathaapi louh-chumbakatv kii khoj ke saath, lui nil ne ise galat sabit kiya
 When the iron-magnet is small enough, it performs the same function as a single magnetic spin under Brownian momentum
 chumbakeey kshetra ke prati isaki pratikriya gunatmak rup se pratichumbak ke samaan hi, lekin bahut badi hoti he
 An electromagnet is a magnet whose magnetism is produced by the flow of an electric current
 jab dhara band ho jaati he, to chumbakeey kshetra gaayab ho jaataa he
 Or a magnet
 oinstin kii vishesh saapekshata siddhant ke parinamswaroop, vidyut or chumbakatv moulik rup se aapas main jude hai
 Both, electromagnetism and magnetismless electromagnetism are incompatible due to effects such as length contraction, time extension, and the fact that the magnetic force is velocity based, with special relativity
 tathaapi, jab vidyut or chumbakatv, donon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he, parinami siddhant vishesh saapekshata ke puri tarah anuroop he
 In particular, the phenomena that one observer sees as purely electrical may be purely magnetic to the other, or more generally the relative contribution of electricity and magnetism depends on the structure of the reference
 is prakaar, vishesh saapekshata vidyut or chumbakatv ko vidyut-chumbakatv kahalaane vaale ekal, avibhajya tatv main "mishrit" karti he, jo saapekshata dwaara antariksh or samay ko antariksh-samay main "mishrit" karne ke anuroop he
 The magnetism is "mediated" by the element by the magnetic field
 vidyut dhara yaa chumbakeey dwidhruv chumbakeey kshetra utpann karata he or badale main, vah kshetra, kshetron main rahane vaale anya kanon par chumbakeey bal pradaan karata he
 Maxwell's equations, which simplify the Biot – Savert theory in the case of steady currents, describe the origin and behavior of the regions governing these forces
 isliye jab bhi vidyut aaweshit kan gatisheel hote hai, chumbakatv ko dekha jaataa he --- udhaaharan ke liye, vidyut dhara main electron ke sanchalan se, yaa kuch maamalon main parmaanu ke nabhik ke aas-paas electron kii kakshiya gati se
 ve bhi kwantum-yantric prachakran se ubharne vaale "aantarik" chumbakeey dwidhruv se utpann hote hai
 The conditions that make up the magnetic field - the dynamic charge in the current or in an atom and the internal magnetic dipole - are also the conditions in which the magnetic field has an effect, producing a force
 gatisheel aavesh ke liye sutara nimnatah he; aantarik dwidhruv par balon ke liye, chumbakeey dwidhruv dekhen
 When a charged particle passes through a magnetic field B, it realizes the f Lorenz force given by the product per: jahaan Because it is a by-product, the force is perpendicular to both the speed of the particle and the magnetic field
 yah iskaa anugaman karata he ki chumbakeey bal kan par koi kaam nahin karata; vah kan kii gati kii disha ko parivartit kar saktaa he, lekin uski chaal ko tej yaa dhimaa nahin kar saktaa

 When creating a gun-like configuration where the middle finger crosses the index finger, the fingers represent the velocity vector, magnetic field vector, and force vector, respectively
 daahine haath kaa niyam bhi dekhen
 With the terms "south Pole" and "north Pole", the most common source of magnetic field displayed in nature is bipolar, as old as the use of magnets as compasses, where they interact with the Earth's magnetic field in the world
 North and South used to inform the Pole
 chunki chumbak ke vipareet sire ek duusare ke prati aakarshith hote hai, chumbak kaa uttari dhruv duusare chumbak ke dakshini dhruv ke prati aakarshith hota he
 The Earth's North Magnetic Pole is physically the South Pole, because it attracts the North Pole of the compass
 chumbakeey kshetra main urja rahati he or bhautik pranaliyaan kam urja vaale vinyason kii ore gatisheel hoti hai
 When the counter-magnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic dipole attempts to align itself to the opposite polarity of the field by which the net field force is reduced
 jab louh-chumbakeey dravya ko chumbakeey kshetra ke antargat rakhaa jaataa he, tab chumbakeey dwidhruv prayukt kshetra ke saath sanrekhit hote hai, is prakaar chumbakeey domenon kii domen deevaaron ko vistrut karte hai
 Since the bar magnet receives ferromagnetism through uniformly distributed electrons throughout the bar, when the bar magnet is cut in two, each piece is a small bar magnet
 haalanki kaha jaataa he ki chumbak main uttari dhruv or dakshini dhruv hote hai, in do dhruvon ko ek duusare se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 a monopole - if there exists one - will be a new radically different type of magnetic object
 vah akele uttari dhruv ke rup main kaary karegi, jo dakshini dhruv se, yaa iske vipareet judi nahin hogi
 a unipolar will carry a magnetic charge similar to an electric current
 1931 ke baad se kramik khojon ke baavjood, unhen kabhi nahin dekha gaya,2010 ke anusaar or sambhawatah ve vidyaman nahin honge
 Nevertheless, some theoretical physics samples predict the existence of these magnetic monopoles
 1931 main paul diraaq ne dekha ki vidyut or chumbakatv main kuch pratisamya hone ke kaaran, jaise ki kwantum siddhant kaa purvanumaan he ki vyaktigat dhanatmak yaa rinatmak aavesh bina vipareet aavesh ke dekhe ja sakate hai, viyukt dakshin or uttar chumbakeey dhruv parilakshith hone chahie
 Using quantum theory, Dirac demonstrated that if magnetic monopoles exist, quantization of electric charge can be explained — that is, why reflected elemental particles carry charges that are multiples of the charge of the electron
 kuch bhavy ekikrut siddhant tatviya kanon ke vipareet, ekadhruvon kaa purvanumaan lagaate hai, jo soliton hai
 The initial results of the use of these samples to estimate the number of monopoles produced in the Big Bang contradicted cosmic observations - monopoles would be so large and massive that their expansion into the universe would have stopped long ago
 tathaapi, mudrasphiti kaa vichaar is samasya ko hal karne main safal rahaa tha, jahaan namoonay banaae gaye jinamein ekadhruv vidyaman honge lekin vartmaan prekshanon ke saath unki anurupata durlabh thi
 Theoretically all types of magnetism are derived from specific quantum-mechanical elements that cannot be easily interpreted
 An already successful specimen was developed in 1927 by Walter Hettler and Fritz London, who derived quantum mechanics, how Hydrogen atoms were formed from hydrogen atoms, i
e
 u a { \ displaystyle u_ {A}} u a { \ displaystyle u_ {A}} and u b { \ displaystyl concentrated in nuclei a and B
 e u_ {B}} u b { \ displaystyle u_ {B}} atomic hydrogen cell, see below
 It is not at all clear that this leads to magnetism, but will be explained in the following
 hetler-landan siddhant ke anusaar, tathakthith do-pindia aanvik σ { \ displaystyle \ sigma } -kakshon kaa gathan hota he, yatha parinami kakshiya he: The final product here implies that the first electron, r 1, is in an atomic hydrogen-orbital centered in the second nucleus, while the second electron moves around the first nucleus
 is "vinimay" tatv kwantum yantric gun kii abhivyakti he ki samaan gun vaale kanon kii bhinn pahchaan nahin ho sakati he
 This is not only specific to the formation of chemical bonds, but we will see that for magnetism as well, that is, in this respect word exchange interactions arise, a term which is essential to the origin of magnetism and which is the electrodynamic dipole
 The energy generated by the dipole interaction is roughly stronger than 100 and 1000 factors
 prachakran prakaarya ke maamle main χ { \ displaystyle \ chi }, jo chumbakatv ke liye jimmedaar he, hamane pehle hi pauli siddhant kaa ullekh kiya he, yatha ek samamit kakshiya ko prati-samamit prachakran prakaarya sahit guna karnaa chahie or iske vipareet 
 is prakaar: That is, not only u a { \ displaystyle u_ {A}} and u b { \ displaystyle u_ {B}} should be replaced by α and β, respectively, but also the sign + by the - sign and finally by the ri discrete values
 si; From which we have α = β = 1 { \ displaystyle \ alpha = \ beta = 1} and α = β = 0 { \ displaystyle \ alpha = \ beta = 0}
 The "single state" ie - sign, ie: spinning is parallel, that is, for solids we have anti-ferromagnetism and one atom for two atomic molecules
 rasinic bandhan ke nirmaan kii pravriti pratisamamit prachakran dasha main swatah pauli siddhant ke madhyam se parinat hoti he
 Conversely, coulomb distraction of electrons, i
e
 their tendency to avoid each other by this distraction, would result in the symmetric orbital function of these two particles and the complementary symmetric spin function
 is prakaar, ab prachakran samanaantar honge 
 The last mentioned trend dominates in ferrous metals, cobalt, and nickel, and in some rare soils that are ferromagnetic
 adhikansh anya dhaatuen, jahaan pratham ullikhit pravriti haaavee hoti he, achumbakeey yaa prati-lauhachumbakeey hai 
 dwiparmanuk gaisen bhi lagbhag vishesh rup se dwichumbakeey hai or pratichumbakeey nahin
 However, the oxygen molecule is an important exception to life sciences due to the π-orbital induction
 hetler-landan ke vichaaron ko chumbakatv ke heznberg namoonay ke saath samanyikrut kiya ja saktaa he 
 The explanation of this element is thus essentially based on all the nuances of quantum mechanics, while electrodynamics mainly covers phenomenology

 Bio-degradable plastics are plastics that decompose in the environment as natural aerobic and non-biodegradable
 plastic kaa jaev-nimnikaran, paryaavaran main sookshmjivon ko sakriy kar sampann kiya ja saktaa he, jo plastic jhilliyon kii anvik sanrachana ke upaapachay dwaara ek khaad sadrush mitti vaale akriy padaarth kaa nirmaan karte hai or paryaavaran ke liye kam hanikaarak hote hai
 They are made of bio-plastics or plastics whose components are made from renewable raw materials, or petroleum-based plastics with a mixture of additional substances

 Bio-degrading plastics are manufactured exclusively in two forms: injection molded, which are used in food service items to be thrown away after use, and membranes, which are especially organic fruit packaging and collections for leaves and grass clippings
 Doing bags and non-weeds are used in agricultural weeds
 america main eestm international jaev-nimnikarak maanakon ko paribhaashit karne vaala ek aadhikarik nikaay he
 The special sub-committee tracking these standards is under the D20
96 committee of 'environmentally Degradable Plastics and Biobased Products'
 maujuuda eestm maanakon ko maanak vinirdeshon tathaa maanak jaanch vidhiyon ke rup main paribhaashit kiye jate hai
 Standard specifications create successful and unsuccessful scenarios, while standard screening methods identify specific probe scales that promote a specific biodegradable plasticity
 vartmaan main aise teen eestm maanak vinirdesh hai, jo mukhya rup se khaad-nirmaan vaale paryaavarnon main jaev-nimnikarak plasticon se nipatate hai, jinamein eestm D6400-04 khaad banane yogya plasticon ke liye maanak vinirdesh, eestm D6868 - 03 kaagaj ke starikaran tathaa anya adhistareey padaarthon ke rup main prayukt plasticon ke liye maanak vinirdesh, tathaa eestm D7081 - 05 samudri paryaavaran main aplavi jaev-nimnikarak plasticon ke liye maanak vinirdesh hote hai
 Currently the most accurate standard screening method for non-biodegradable environment is ASTM D5511 - 02, which is the standard screening method for non-biodegradable determination of plastic materials under high-solids pre-digestive conditions
 avayujeevi paryaavarnon main ek anya maanak jaanch vidhi he- ASTM D5526 - 94 jo twarit avayujeevi kachare kii dashaon main plastic padaarthon ke avayujeevi jaev-nimnikaran ke nirdhaaran kii ek anya maanak jaanch vidhi he, is jaanch ko pradarshit karnaa atyant kathin sabit hua he

 However, biodegradable plastics are not drugs for every brain
 Some critics believe that a potential environmental disadvantage of certified biodegradable plastics is that the carbon trapped in them is released into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases
 haalanki prakritik-padaarthon se praapt jaev-nimnikarak plastic, jaise subjiyon vaali fasalon se yaa jantu utpaada se vyutpann plastic apni vruddhi ke charan main CO2 ko alag karte hai, is prakaar jab ve apaghatit ho rahe hote hai keval tabhi CO2 mukt karte hai, isliye carbon dioxide utsarjan main koi parinami vruddhi nahin hoti
 However, bio-degradation of certified biodegradable plastics requires a special environment with moisture and oxygen, which is found in commercially operated manure manufacturing sites
 prakritik padaarthon se praapt jaev-nimnikarak plasticon ke prasanskaran main prayukt carbon, jeevashm indhan tathaa jal ke kul prayog tathaa unke maanav khaadya aapurti ke liye nakaaratmak prabhaav ko lekar kaaphi bahes chal rahi he
 Traditional plastics made from non-renewable fossil fuels contain more carbon trapped than the amount of carbon used in plastic processing
 carbon, plastic ke latis ke bheetar fanse hote hai tathaa ve virale hi punarchakrit kiye jate hai
 The concern is that when other biodegradable materials, including real biodegradable plastics, decompose in a non-biodegradable environment, other greenhouse gases, methane, may be free
 in vishesh kachra-sthalon vaale vaataavaran se nirmit methane vishesh rup se ekatra kiya jaataa he or vaataavaran main mukt hone se bachaane ke liye unhen jala diya jaataa he
 Some garbage sites now collect methane biogas for the use of clean cheap energy
 nishchit rup se ajaev-nimnikarak plastic ko jalaane se caburn daai oxide bhi mukt hota he
 Plastics remain in existence for hundreds of years due to the deposition of plastics made from natural biodegraders of non-biodegradable environments
 yues ipie ne kachra sthal digaayan tathaa nirmaan ke liye kade maanak lagu kiye hai taaki pramukh rup se kachra sthalon main jaev-nimnikaran ko roka ja sake
 isliye kachra sthal se mithain kaa uddeshypurna utpaadan ek viral udhaaharan he or adhiktar shahari thos apshisht ke liye niyam nahin he
 It is also possible that eventually bacteria will develop the ability to degrade plastics
 This has already happened with nylon: In 1975, two types of nylon-resistant bacteria, flavobacteria and Pseudomonas, were discovered that found an enzyme capable of decomposing nylon
 jabaki niptaan ke liye koi samaadhaan nahin he, to aise main yah sambhav he ki jeevanuon main anya sanshleshit plasticon ke upyog kii bhi kshamta viksit kar le
 varsh 2008 main 16 varsh ke ek ladke ne kathith rup se plastic khaane vaale do jeevanuon kaa pataa lagaaya
 The latter possibility was in fact the subject of a cautionary novel written by Cyberman's producers Kit Pedlar and Gerry Davis, where he reused the plot of the first serial of his Doomwatch series
 varsh 1971 main likhit upanyaas mutant 59: da plastic iter, ek aisi kahani he, jisamen plastic ke bhakshan ke liye utpann hone vaale yaa kritrim rup se nirmit kiye jeevanu ko ek bade shahar main chhod diya jaataa he
 Bio-polymer materials such as polyhydroxyalkanoate can be completely composted in an industrial manure manufacturing site
 polilactic amla 100% khaad banane vaala ek anya jaev-bahulak he, jo kisi audyogic khaad nirmaan sthal par 60C par puri tarah se nimnikrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Complete biodegradable plastics are quite expensive, in part because they are not widely manufactured to achieve large economic scale
 kuch yojya padaarth jab ek paaramparik plastic main milaae jate hai, tab sookshmjeev unke hydrocarbonon ko soonghtey hai or unki anvik sanrachana kii ore aakarshith ho jate hai
 When oil is in the ground, microorganisms are attracted to hydrocarbons and feed oil to form natural gas, which contains 50% methane gas
 tel ko jab vikhandit kiya jaataa he, tab 4% kaa istemaal plastic udyog ke liye kiya jaataa he, par yadi plastic udyog is 4% kaa prayog nahin karata he tab is 4% ko bekaar mana jaataa he or use baahar kar diya jaataa he yaa hataa diya jaataa he or apshisht niptaan sthal par use jamaa kar diya jaataa he; anya 4% kaa prayog aapke upabhokta utpaadon ke nirmaan main kiya jaataa he
 It is during this stage of fission of organic compounds that attract microorganisms towards the molecular structure of plastic they are burnt
 jalaae jane vaale jaivik yogic tathaa anya pramukh yogic jo sookshmjivon kii nirdisht sankhya kii bodh ko badhaate hai or sookshmjivon ke piech santulan ko plastic kii aanvik sanrachana main sthit kiya jaataa he, taaki aise plastic utpaada banaae ja saken jo saamaanya plastic kii apeksha 100 guna adhik tivrata se nimnikrut ho sake
 Under appropriate conditions, biodegradable plastics can be degraded to the point where microorganisms can metabolize them
 tel aadhaarit jaev-nimnikarak plastic sangrahit carbon ko carbon dioxide ke rup main mukt kar sakate hai
 Mud-based bio-plastics made by sustainable agricultural methods can be almost carbon neutral, but can have a detrimental effect on soil, water use and quality, and can lead to high food prices
 ‘socity of plastic ejiniers’ ke anusaar har varsh duniyabar main lagbhag 200 million ton plastic kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 Of those 200 million tons, 26 million tons are produced in the US
 varsh 2003 main ipie ne soochna di ki un 26 million ton plastic kacharon kaa keval 5
8% hi punarchakrit kiya jaataa he, haalanki yah teji se bad rahaa he
 The major reason that frustrates plastic recycling targets is that traditional plastics are often mixed with organic wastes, making it difficult and impractical to recycling the polymers within it without expensive sanitation and cleaning methods
 duusari ore, in mishrit jaivik padaarthon se khaad kaa nirmaan karnaa apshishton kii ek badi maatra kaa nipataara karne or saamudayik punarchakran lakshyon main naatakeey rup se vruddhi karne kii ek sambhavit ranneeti hoti he
 Food waste, and wet, non-recycling paper include 50 million tons of solid urban waste
 In these waste classes, bio-degradable plastics can displace unmanageable plastics, causing urban waste to be composted, large quantities of unused waste from waste sites Becomes a major reason for applying to other work
 bhale hi paaramparik plasticon kii thodi maatra hi jaivik padaarthon main milaai jaae par plastic ke nanhe tukdon ke kaaran jaivik apshishton kaa puraa samooh hi “sandooshit” ho jaataa he, jo acchhee gunvattta vaale khaad padaarth ko barabaad kar detaa he
 Therefore, fertilizer manufacturers will not accept mixed organic waste classes until they are completely devoid of non-degradable plastics
 Therefore, even a relatively small amount of unmodifiable plastics disrupts an important waste disposal strategy
 haalanki jaev-nimnikarak plasticon ke samarthak yah daleel pesh karte hai ki ye padaarth is samasya kaa samaadhaan prastut karte hai
 Authenticated biodegradable plastics compost plants have their full bio-degradable capacity as well as their usefulness
 apekshaakrit kam maatra main mishrit plasticon ko punarchakrit karne ke bare main chintit hone kii bajaae ye samarthak yah maanate hai ki pramanit jaev-nimnikarak plasticon ko anya jaivik apshishton ke saath sheeghra mishrit kiya ja saktaa he, jisase aprapya thos apshisht kii badi maatra main khaad-nirmaan sambhav ho paata he
 Commercial composting of all mixed organic materials then becomes commercially viable and economically sustainable
 adhik sankhya main nagar-nikaay adhik boj vaale kachra sthalon se ullekhneey maatra main apshishton kaa disha-parivartan kar sakate hai, kyonki sampurna apshisht varg ab jaev-nimnikarak ho jate hai or isliye unka prasanskaran aasaan ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the use of biodegradable plastics is seen as a motivator for the full realization of large quantities of urban concrete waste, which would be inaccessible by means other than waste sites or burning ash

 In heart disease, this hospital has been given Interventional Cardiology, electro-physiology and Pediatric Cardiology, and also performs cardiac surgeries like Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, Redo Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, the Dor procedure and the Ross procedure
 a total of 13000 coronary bypass grafting operations have been performed in the hospital
 The hospital also acts as a philanthropist by charging less than the normal cost for procedures like angiogram and cardiac surgery to people who cannot afford to pay the huge costs
 Narayana Hrudayalaya also has 17 Coronary Care units which are based in remote cardiac hospitals but are linked to Narayana Hrudayalaya
 These units handle emergency cardiac-related cases and the patients are controlled and stabilised before the cardiac specialists are consulted
 The hospital also runs postgraduate programs for doctors and other medical staff on heartcare and also offers India's only formal training program for pediatric cardiac surgery
 The telemedicine service was started in the hospital in the year 2002 to cater mainly to the rural populace in the country
 The telemedicine network of the hospital connects to countries like Malyasia, Mauritius and Pakistan; with most of the cases referred through telemedicine being cardiac ones
 ECG reports, audio / visual data, CT scans, X-rays, mris and their analysis are exchanged via the telephone line, broadband connection or satellite
 The hospital uses a telemedicine ECG machine manufactured by Schiller India, a Germany-based company
 The telemedicine services provided by the hospital are free and more than 21000 cases have been referred using this service
 Narayana Hrudayalaya is also a part of the "the Karnataka Telemedine Project" which was inaugurated on April 8, 2002 and links two rural hospitals in Saragur, Karnataka viz
 saanchaa:karnataka topics The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory

 nanda devi rajajat bharat ke uttaranchal rajya main hone vaali ek nanda devi kii ek dharmik yatra he
 It is one of the most famous cultural events in Uttarakhand
 yah lagbhag 12 varshon ke baad yojit hoti he
 The last caste was in 2012
 agali rajajat san 2023 main hogi
 According to folk history, Nanda was the Ishtadevi of the Katyuri dynasty of Kunmao along with the kings of Garhwal
 ishtadevi hone ke kaaran nandadevi ko rajrajeshwari kahkar sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 Nandadevi is seen as the sister of Parvati, but sometimes Nandadevi is considered as Parvati
 nanda ke anek naamon main pramukh hai shiva, sunanda, shubhananda, nandini
 Being worshiped uniformly throughout Uttaranchal, the entire region of Nandadevi has been seen as a source of religious unity
 rupkund ke narkankal, baguvavasa main sthit aathvin sadi kii siddh vinayak bhagwaan ganesh kii kaale pathar kii murti aadi is yatra kii aitihaasikta ko siddh karte hai, saath hi gadhwal ke paramparaagat nanda jagari bhi is yatra kii kahani ko bayaan karte hai
 There are two types of caste associated with Nandadevi
 vaarshik jaat or rajajat
 The annual caste takes place every year in the month of august-september
 jo kurud ke nanda mandir se shuru hokar vedni kund tak jaati he or phir laut aati he, lekin rajajat 12 varsh yaa usase adhik samyantaral main hoti he
 According to belief, this historical journey of the Goddess starts from Nautigaon in Chamoli and also from the temple of Kurud, the Dasholi and Badhon docks leave for Rajajat
 is yatra main lagbhag 250 kilometre kii duuri, nauti se homkund tak paidal kerani padati he
 During this time, dense forests have to cross stony routes, inaccessible peaks and snowy mountains
 alag-alag raaston se ye doliyaan yatra main milti he
 Apart from this, dolis and chhatoli from village to village are also included in this journey
 kumaun se bhi almoda, kataarmal or nainital se doliyaan nandakeshari main aakar rajajat main shaamil hoti he
 The second stop of this journey started from Nauti is eda-badharani
 phir yatra laut kar nauti aati he
 After this, the world-famous Rupkund, shila-samudra, Hoskund to Chananyanghat from Kasunwa, Sem, Koti, Bhagauti, Kulsari, Chapados, Lohajung, Vaan, Bedni, Patar Nachouni, Nandprayag via Sutol and then Nauti come and complete the cycle of travel
 it happens
 yah duuri kareeb 280 kilometre he
 This Rajjaat also includes Chausingya Khadu which is born in the local area before the time of the Rajajat, in a two-sided bag placed on its back, the devotees keep jewelry, adornments and other light buffets for the goddess, Which, after worshiping in Homkund, departs further towards the Himalayas
 logon kii manyata he ki chousingya khadu aage bikat himalay main jaakar lupt ho jaataa he va nandadevi ke kshetra kailash main pravesh kar jaataa he
 In the year 2000, this dynasty received wide publicity and thousands of people from all over the country and abroad participated in it
 rajajat uttarakhand kii samgr samskruti ko prastut karata he
 For this reason, on January 26, 2005, the tableau of the state of Uttaranchal was released on the Rajajat
 pichley kuch varshon se payrton vibhaag dwaara rupkund mahotv kaa aayojan bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Local people have also constituted Shri Nandadevi Rajajat Samiti for the successful conduction of this journey
 isi samiti ke tattvadhan main nandadevi rajajat kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 According to the tradition, the yatra is announced on the day of Vasant Panchami
 iske pashchaat isaki taiyaariyon kaa silsilaa armbh hota he
 In this, apart from the Nautiyal of Nauti and Kasuwar of Kasuva, along with other related parties like 14 Sayanas of Badhan, 12 Thoki Brahmins of Chandpur and other priests, the District Administration and various departments of the Central and State Government prepared the outline of the journey
 Determination is made
 { manyataon ke anusaar rajajat tab hoti he, jab devi kaa dosha lagane ke lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 Dhyani worships Bhumiya Devi Ufrai It is called Maudvi
 dhyaniyan yatra nikaalati he, jise dol jaataraa kaha jaataa he
 Kunwar Nauti of Kasun goes to the village and pleads for Rajajat
 kunwar ringaal kii chhatoli or chousingya khadu lekar aate hai
 The birth of Chausinga Khadu is a special thing of Rajajat
 nautial or kunwar log nanda ke uphaar ko chousinga khadu kii peeth par homkund tak le jate hai
 Khadu moves alone from there
 khadu ke janm saath hi vicitra chamatkaarik ghatnaye shuru ho jaati he
 The lion starts coming there from the same day in which it takes birth and the lion keeps on coming till the owner of the khadu makes it his wish to pay it to the king
 } Jinda feudalism in the name of Rajajat - Jai Singh Rawat - Sumar Nanda Rajajat is going to start from August 29 in the world's most treacherous, complex and extreme religious walking tours led by a four-horned frog
 basant panchami ke avasar par ghoshit kaarykram ke anusaar puure 19 din tak chalane ke baad yah yatra 16 sitambar ko sampann hogi
 Religious traditions have been changing over time in this Himalayan Mahakumbh, but when feudal traditions will change, this question is being left open and teasing democracy workers
 badrinaath ke kapatodghatan kii hi tarah chamoli gadhwal ke kasuva gaanv ke kunwaron or nauti gaanv ke unke raajaguru nautiyaalon ne bhi is basant panchami ko nandadevi rajajat ke kaarykram kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The Thakurs of Kansuva village consider themselves as descendants of the younger brother of Ajaypal, a king of the Panwar dynasty, who ruled Garhwal for centuries, and as a king, he leads this Himalayan religious padyatra and considers it his personal program
 
 tehri rajshahi ke vanshaj bhi basant panchami ke din har saal badrinaath ke kapatodghatan kii tithi tay karte hai
 According to the program announced by the Kuvars and Nautiyals, the yatra will return from Nauti to Chelgi on August 29 and will return on September 16 after 19 stops in the Himalayan region
 is jokhimpurna yatra ke sakshi banane ke liye desh videsh se log pahunchate hai
 Surprisingly, the priests and the rightful worshipers of the temple from which the ancient temple of Nudai Devi is to be run from the ancient temple of Kurud have been thrown aside like a fly of milk
 rajya sarkaar bhi dharmik bhaawanaaon or praan paramparaon ke bajaay saamanti vyavastha ke saath dridhtaa se khadi najar aa rahi he
 Preparations have been started for Uttarakhand government including the organizing committee and other related parties
 iske saath hi is aitihaasik yatra kaa netritv karne chousingya khadu kii talash bhi shuru ho gayi he
 Prior to the yatra, such a bizarre frog has been born anywhere in the villages of Chandpur and Dasoli strips
 vishesh kaarigari se baniin ringaal kii chantoliyon, doliyon or nishaanon ke saath lagbhag 200 sthaneey devi devtaa is mahayatra main shaamil hote hai
 As per the ancient practice, wherever the journey takes place, the people of that village leave their houses open for the travelers and spend the night themselves in goshalas or elsewhere
 samudratal se 13200 foot kii unchai par sthit is yatra ke gantavya homkund ke baad rang birange vastron se lipte is mende ko akele hi kailash kii ore ravaanaa kar diya jaataa he
 During the journey till the sixteenth stop, this Khadu or Mendha remains near the Chantoli made from the ringle of Nanda Devi
 samudratal se 3200 foot se lekar 17500 foot kii oonchai k pahunchane vaali yah 280 kimi lambi padayatra 19 padaavon se guzarati he
 Vana is the last village of the yatra
 pracheen kaal main iske 22 padaav hone ke bhi pramaan hai
 The journey beyond Vana is inaccessible and at the same time restricted and prohibitive
 aayojan samiti ke sachiv or raajaguru ke rup main nautial brahmanon ke pratinidhi ke rup main kaary kar rahe bhuwan nautial tathaa unke pita devraam nautial ke lekhon ke anusaar wan se kuch aage rinakidhar se chamade kii vastuen jaise juute, belt aadi tathaa gaaje-baaje, striyaan-bachche, abhakshya padaarth khaane vaali jatiyaan ityadi rajajat main nishiddh ho jate hai
 Implicit eating castes is not hidden

 According to Nanda, Parvati is the daughter of Himalayas and her in-laws are also considered to be Kailash
 isaliye vah khason yaa khasiyon kii pracheenatam aradhy devi he
 There is evidence of this visit from the reign of the Katyuri dynasty before the Panwar dynasty

 Whose skeletons are still scattered in Roop Kund
 nauti main rajajat ke san 1843, 1863, 1886, 1905, 1925, 1951, 1968 evam 1987 main yojit hone ke abhilekh uplabdh hai
 It is clear from the prevailing belief that this yatra does not leave every 12 years
 kurud se praapt abhilekhon main 1845 tathaa 1865 kii rajajaton kaa vivaran he
 The priests of Kurud and most historians consider Nanda to be the oldest pilgrimage of khasas, not of pawars
 isi aadhaar par ayudhjivi khason kii aradhy kurud kii nanda devi kii doli hi is rajajat kaa netritv karti rahi he
 The trek to the high Himalayas increases the thrill of travelers as well
 iskaa pehla padaav 10 kilometre par ida badhaani he
 Two stops are then in Nauti
 nauti ke baad saim, koti, bhagoti, kulsari, chepadiyun, nandakeshari, faldiya gaanv, mundoli, wan, gaerolipaatal, pataranchauniyan hote huye yatra shilasamudr hote huye apane gantavya homkund pahunchati he
 After pinddaan and puja archana in this kund, the yatra begins to descend after the Chasingya Khadu leaves the Himalayan peaks
 uske baad yatra sutol, ghat or nauti laut aati he
 During this journey, Lohajung is such a place where even today large stones and trees have pierced iron arrows
 kuch tir sangrahalayon ke liye nikaal liye gayi hai
 This place is predicted to be a fierce battle
 isi maarg par 17500 foot kii oonchai par junragali bhi he jise paar karnaa bahut hi jokhim kaa kaam he
 Historians believe that at some time people used to jump from the same place towards Mahaprayan towards Roopkund
 yamuna dutt vaishnav ne ise mrityu gali kii sangya di he
 The skeletons of hundreds of passengers killed in the accident as well as those who jumped down from here have been found in Roopkund, which has been confirmed by DNA
 iske baad yatra shila samudr kii ore neeche utarati he
 The view of the sunrise of the rock sea is light
 vahaan se saamne kii nandaghanghati chotii par surya kii lau dikhne ke saath hi teen dipakon kii lau aalokik najaara pesh karti he
 Roopkund Lake is surrounded by snow-capped peaks on the route of Rajajat, to solve the mystery of which scientists from many countries of the world have been studying for decades
 koi roak tok na hone ke kaaran samudratal se 16200 foot kii unchai par sthit rupkund jhil se desh videsh ke vaigyanik boron main bhar kar ateet ke rahasyon kaa khajaana samete huye ye nar kankal or anya avshesh uthaa kar le gayi hai
 Nevertheless, many skeletons still lie on the banks of this lake far above human settlements
 kuch kankalon par maance tak paaya gaya he
 Along with the skeletons, jewelery, Rajasthani shoes, betel nuts, stained teeth, shellfish, conch bangles etc
 are scattered
 in sekadon kankalon kaa pataa sabase pehle 1942 main ek van ranger ne lagaaya tha
 The skeletons of this lake were first studied by American scientist Dr
 James Graffin in 1957
 us samay usne in kankalon kii umr lagbhag 650 bataai thi
 What is shocking is revealed by the 2004 National Geographic Channel testing of these skeletons conducted in laboratories in Britain and Germany, that these skeletons belong to the 9th century and that they are all dead at the same time
 inamen sthaneey logon ke kankal bahut kam hai
 The rest are almost all of the same species
 inamen do khopadiyaan aisi bhi mili hai jo ki maharashtra kii ek khaas brahman jati ke diene tathaa sir ke kankal kii banaavat se milte hai
 The channel has come to the conclusion that these skeletons must have been of Yashodhaval, his queens, dancers, soldiers, sevadars or kaharas and the two Brahmins running together

 But the power of the younger brother of the king of hundreds of years ago still exists
 ek gaanv ke logon ke purakhon kaa sabhi yatriyon se tarpan karaane par bhi sawaal uthne lage hai
 According to historians like Shivraj Singh Rawat, Rajajat does not mean the feudal journey or the journey of the king, but the journey of Rajarajeshwari
 is kshetra main nanda devi ko rajrajeshwari ke naam se bhi pukaara jaataa he
 Supporters of the Samanti tradition claim that the people of Kansuva village are the descendants of Garhwal Naresh Ajay Pal
 ve maanate hai ki raja ne jab chandpur gadhi se rajdhani badal di to consuva main rahane vaala uskaa chota bhai vahiin rah gaya
 That is why the people of that village write their caste Kanwar
 bharat ke kisi bhi naagarik ko apni jati kuch bhi likhane kii aazaadee he
 One can also write himself a Emperor, but he does not become a Emperor
 is yatra ke sarvesarva swayan ko rajkunvar likh rahe hai to unako isaki bhi aazaadee he magar unhen rajkumaar kii tarah praja se pesh aane kii aazaadee nahin he
 Normally, Rajkumar, born of the same mother, does not leave the royal family and stop in the village to do farming or farming
 vahaan rukne vaale raajkanvar kaa naam bhi koi nahin jaanata
 As such, kings had many wives, and all the wives or sub-wives of the king had no children of kings
 itihaasavetta captain shoorveer singh panvar ke anusaar ajaypal panvar vansheey raajaaon kii kadi main 37 waan raja tha
 According to the history of Garhwal written by Pandit Harikrishna Raturi, Ajaypal shifted the capital from Chandpur Garhi to Devalgarh in 1512
 uttrakhand ke kai buddhijivi lagbhag 500 saal pehle ke kisi raja ke bhai ke kuch banshjon dwaara ab bhi swayan ko rajkunvar bataaye jane ko ataarkik or saamanti soch bataate hai
 They believe that thousands of princes would have been born from Ajaypal to the last king Manvendra Shah and today their number of descendants would have been in millions
 magar unamem se koi bhi swayan ko rajkunvar nahin kehalaata or naa hi kshetra ke anya logon se raja kii tarah bartaav karata he
 Even the cousin of Maharaja Manvendra Shah or other brothers of the family do not call themselves Rajkunwar
 vastav main yah kaise sambhav he ki chandpur gadhi chhodane ke baad paidaa hone vaale raajaaon ke bhai paidaa huye hi na hon
 In fact, as the distance from Rajmahal increased, the Panwar dynasty later changed their castes to Bartwal, Panwar, Parmar, Rawat and Kanwar etc
 himalayan jilon ke gajetir main iti atkinson ne kuch vidwaanon dwaara sankalit gadhwal nareshon kii suchi di gayi he
 Of these, Ajaypal is not named among the 61 kings in Hardwik's list

 In the list of Bekat, 54 names have been given to Pradyuman Shah in the series of kings

 Ajaypal is named 35th in the list compiled by Williams

 Atkinson himself has said that these were the kings who achieved some fame or were recorded in history for certain things
 varanaa us dauraan gadhwal main inke alaava bhi kai anya raja huye honge
 The priests of Kurud are unhappy with the government of Uttarakhand and the Samanthi Rajajat Ayazan Committee under its patronage, to give feudal appearance to Rajajat and to consider themselves as king
 isse pehle puure 19 saal baad san 1987 main yojit rajajat main bhi consuva or nauti kii nanda devi kii jaat tathaa kurud kii nanda devi kii jaat alag-alag chali he
 Even at that time, the Rajat dynasty of Nauti and Kansuwa were funded by the government and the Kurud castes following it were nurtured by traditions and beliefs

 Windows Vista is the latest in a series of Microsoft operating systems and possibly the most revolutionary after Windows 95
 haalaanki vista oparating system ko adhik lokapriyata uske triayami graphics swaroop or vibhinn desktop onimeshan kii vajah se mili he lekin vastav main yah microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya ab tak kaa sabase surakshit oparating system bhi mana ja rahaa he
 It is also more efficient in terms of communication and networking than its previous operating system
 vista ke liye hindi samarthan bhi puri tarah uplabdh he or hindi language interphes pack ke madhyam se windos vista ko puri tarah hindi ke rang main ranga ja saktaa he
 Computer users have a curiosity about whether they really need to adopt Windows Vista, the new operating system released by Microsoft
 kya microsoft ke pichley oparating system windos ekspe windos 2003 or windos 2000 kii tulana main isamen aise fitures hai jinaki andekhi karnaa sambhav na ho
 Microsoft claims that Vista is more capable, simpler, faster, smooth and secure than previous Windows
 vista pichley oparating systams kii tulana main adhik teji se khulata or band hota he
 Start up and shutdown processes are completed in five to ten seconds
 haalaanki isamen vista ke apekshaakrit behatar hardware kaa bhi yogadan he lekin khud oparating system ke code main bhi iske liye vishesh prayaas kiya gaya he
 Vista's boom is also due to its new memory management technology that keeps the most used applications ready for loading in advance
 ise 'memri fech' kaha jaataa he
 The Ready Boost feature in Vista has also contributed to its speed
 ab tak windos main memri sambandhi atirikt aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye virtual memri ke rup main pejafilon kaa istemaal hota tha
 These were placed on the computer's hard disk
 lekin vista main iske liye yuasabi drive kaa istemaal karne kaa praavdhaan he jo hard discs kii tulana main bahut tej gati se kaary karti he
 Microsoft has also provided hybrid hard drive support to its new operating system, which increases computer speed by using both flash drives and traditional hard drives combined
 windos vista main sabase pehle dhyaan khinchne vaali cheez he iskaa windos airo naamak khubasurat mukhaawaran or graphic effects
 Although such Sudarshan graphics are already present on Macintosh computers, they are first exposed through 'vista' on the Windows platform
 windos vista home premium, bijness, ultimate or enterprise sanskarnon se yukt un computaron par jinamein ek acha graphics adeptor maujuud ho, airo ke mohak graphics effects kaa anand liya ja saktaa he
 This assertion has changed the core of Windows and has made it much more attractive, diversified and decent than before
 airo ke ucch gunvattta vaale graphics or drishy prabhaavon ne windos computer kaa saundarya to badhaayaa he lekin uski vajah se computer kii kaaryakshmata yaa gati main koi kami nahin aati
 Aero has two major features - Windows Flip and Windows Flip 3D
 inke madhyam se aap apane desktop ko zyada suvidhajanak rup se vyavasthit kar sakate hai
 There has been a general perception among Microsoft users about Microsoft's operating systems that they are less secure than their rival operating systems and are relatively more vulnerable to viruses, hacking, spa ware, etc
 microsoft ne vista main is baat par khaas dhyaan diya he
 Although Vista's original 'kernel' is not rewritten, its security has been strengthened this time
 pehali baat to yah ki ab is oparating system ke sabhi bhaag karnel mod main nahin chalate balki unamem se kuch chuninda hisse hi chalate hai
 Most drivers and software in Vista run in user mode and it is no longer easy to install anything in kernel mode
 iske liye sicurity certificate or administrator str ke adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 And it would be very difficult to get administrator level privileges, especially in offices
 windos vista main saamaanya upyogkarta ke adhikaar simit hai
 It is also not that you as a normal user cannot install the software in your computer
 aisa karne ke liye unhen asthaayee taur par jaruri adhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Microsoft has created two categories of computers for installing Vista operating system - Vista Capable PC and Vista Premium Ready
 aise sabhi computer windos vista sakasham hai jinamein kam se kam 800 megahatrj kaa procesar or 512 embi system memri uplabdh ho
 Such processors are rare now because hardly anyone is buying less than 2 ghz processor in the market
 yadi aapane pichley do ek saalon main apana computer kharida he to uskaa procesar kam se kam itani kshamta kaa avashya hoga
 It may be a matter of system memory that your traditional computer may have 128 MB or 256 MB memory
 aise main aapako saat-aath sau rupye kharch karke apni ram kaa apgredation karwaanaa pad saktaa he
 For Windows Vista capable computers there must be at least a graphics card supporting Direct X9 with WDDM driver support available
 computer ke graphics card main 32 embi kii graphics memri ho to paryaapt he
 Additionally, you will need a DVD ROM drive which may already be present in your computer
 hard discs main mahaj 20 jibi sthaan uplabdh ho, jisamen se 15 jibi khaali sthaan ho, to paryaapt he
 Simply, you don't need anything else to run Windows Vista Home Basic Edition

 hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran kii disha main kai diggajon ne apana yogadan diya, jinamein se acharya kishoridas vaajapeyi tathaa acharya ramchandra verma ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Due to the substantial increase in the number of Hindi learners within and outside the country as a result of the acceptance of the official language of the Union of Hindi language and some states, it seemed necessary and time-bound to set the standard system of Hindi spelling, so that more uniformity in the spelling of Hindi words Can be brought tadnusaar, shiksha mantralay, bharat sarkaar ne 1961 main hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karne ke liye ek visheshgy samiti niyukt kii
 This committee gave the final report in April 1962

 The committee accordingly submitted its final recommendations in 1962 which were approved by the government and eventually ushered in the official process of standardization of Hindi language
 kendriya hindi nideshaalay ne prathmat: 1968 main “hindi vartanee kaa maanakeekaran” naam se laghu pustika prakashit kii
 In the year 1983, a free revised and enhanced version of this booklet "standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling" was published

, newspapers, magazines etc
 officially adopted this standardization to bring uniformity in the language
 varsh 1968 ke maanakeekaran kaa mukhya aadhaar prayokta or tankan yantra rahaa tha
 In today's era of information, the need was felt to revise and change the standardization of Hindi language and to create computerized Unicode for Devanagari script
 isi taratamya main kendriya hindi nideshaalay dwaara varsh 2003 main devanagari lipi tathaa hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran ke liye akhil bhartiya sangoshtee kaa aayojan kiya tha

 yatha:– prakaar, dharm, raashtra
 2
1
2
4 will be the prevailing form of education only
 ise 


 ke rup main nahin likhaa jayega
 The use of either one of the first tr and 


 forms for the combined form of t + r was allowed
 parantu ab iskaa paramparaagat rup tra hi maanak mana jaae
 Other consonants other than sra and tr will be formed as per rules of + R's conjunct 2

 jaise :– kr, pra, br, sr, hr aadi
 2
1

5 The quantity of e will be used immediately before the corresponding consonant, and not before the entire consonant with the second consonant of the conjunct formed from the letter marked with light
 yatha:– kuttim, chitthiyaan, dwitiya, budhimaan, chihnit aadi 
 Note: While quoting the original Sanskrit verses, conjuncts can also be written in the old style
 jaise:– sanyukt, chihn, vidya, vidwaan, vruddh, dwitiya, buddhi aadi
 But if these too are written according to the above rules, then there will be no objection
 2
2
1 hindi ke kaarak chihn sabhi prakaar ke sangya shabdon main pratipadik se pruthak likhe jaaen
 Like: - Ram, Ram, Ram, woman, woman, service etc
 sarvnaam shabdon main ye chihn pratipadik ke saath milakar likhe jaaen
 Like: - You, you, you, he, her, him, her, etc

1 Hyphens should be placed between positions in the compound
 jaise :– ram-lakshmana, shiv-parvati samvaad, dekh-rekh, chaal-chalan, hansee-mazaaq, len-dein, padhanaa-likhnaa, khaanaa-pinaa, khelnaa-kudana aadi
 2
4
2 should be placed before hyphen
 jaise :– tum-sa, ram-jaisaa, chaaku-se tikhe
 2
4
3 Hypnosis should be used only in a compound where there is a possibility of confusion without it, otherwise not
 jaise :– bhu-tatv
 Generally, there is no need to apply hyphens in the masculine compound
 jaise :– raamarajy, rajkumaar, gangaajal, gramvasi, aatmahatya aadi
 2
4
3
1 Similarly, if the hyphen is not put in all the words 'a-nikh', reading it as 'ankh' can also mean 'anger'
 a-nati : anati, a-paras : apras, bhu-tatv : bhootatv aadi samast padon kii bhi yahi sthiti he
 All these pairs are different words from both spelling and meanings
 2

4 kathin sandhiyon se bachane ke liye bhi hifan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Such as - Dv-syllable, Dv-meaning etc

 Factors are also identified in front of some latencies
 jaise :– ab se, tab se, yahan se, vahaan se, sadaa se aadi
 According to the rule, invariably should always be written separately
 jaise :– aap hi ke liye, mujh tak ko, aapke saath, gaz bhar kapadaa, desh bhar, raat bhar, din bhar, vah itnaa bhar kar de, mujhe jane to do, kaam bhi nahin bana, pachaas rupye maatr aadi
 2

3 Honorable 'shri' and 'G' Akshay should also be written separately
 jaise shri shriram, kanhaiyalaal ji, mahatma ji aadi 
 2
5
4 All the posts should be written by adding the copy, only, etc
 jaise - pratidin, pratishat, maanavmaatr, nimittamaatr, yathasamay, yathochit aadi
 It is a well-known rule that all posts are considered one if there is no harm
 at use vyast rup main na likhakar ek saath likhnaa hi sangat he
 The phrase 'ten rupees only', 'mere two persons' is composed
 yahan maatr alag se likhaa jaae

0 Anusvara is consonant and nasal disorder of resonance
 hindi main ye donon arthbhedak bhi hai
 Hence, both Anusvara and resonance mark will be prevalent in Hindi
 2
6
1 anuswaar 2

1
1 Reminders of Sanskrit words will remain the same before other class characters
 jaise - sanyog, sangrakshan, sanlagn, samvaad, kansa, hinsr aadi
 2
6
1
2 As a combined consonant, if any of the remaining four letters after the fifth letter is used, the reminder should be used for uniformity and convenience of printing / writing
 jaise - pankaj, ganga, chanchal, kanjus, kanth, thanda, sant, sandhya, mandir, sampadak, sambandh aadi 
 The forms kept in bandhani will be valid only in Sanskrit citations
 hindi main bindi kaa prayog karnaa hi uchit hoga
 2
6
1
3 If any letter of any other class comes after the Panchamakshar, then the Panchamakhar will not be changed as a reminder
 jaise :– vaanmay, anya, chinmay, unmukh aadi 
 2
6
1
4 If the fifth Varna comes in divine form, the fifth Varna will not be converted into Anusvara
 jaise - ann, sammelan, sammati aadi 
 2
6
1
5 It would be good to write the nasal consonant in full to remove the confusion of half-letter or anusvara in words accepted from English, Urdu
 jaise :– limka, tankhaah, tinkaa, tamgaa, kamasin aadi
 2
6

6 The use of anusvara at the end of some corresponding Sanskrit words is indicative of M
 jaise - ahan, evam, paran, shivan 
 2

2 Resonance 2
6
2
1 hindi ke shabdon main uchit dhang se chandrabindu kaa prayog anivaary hoga
 2

2 Resonance is not consonant, vowels have a sound quality
 anunasik swaron ke uccharan main naak se bhi hawa nikalati he
 Like: - Come, come, go, mother, am, come
 2

3 chandrabindu ke bina praaia: arth main bhram kii gunjaaish rahati he
 Such as: - Hans: Laughing, Angana: Angana, Swang: Swang etc
 atev aise bhram ko dur karne ke liye chandrabindu kaa prayog avashya kiya janaa chahie
 But where there is a lot of difficulty in printing etc
 with the use of the lunar point and the use of the point in place of the lunar point does not cause any confusion, there will be a relaxation of the use of the point in place of the lunar point
 jaise :– nahin, main, main aadi
 In the context of poetry etc
, Chandrabindu must be used in the context of verses
 isi prakaar chote bacchon kii praveshikaon main jahaan chandrabindu kaa uccharan abhisht ho, vahaan mote aksharon main uskaa yathasthaan sarvatra prayog kiya jaae
 Such as - Where, laughing, courtyard, grooming, me, I, not etc
 2

1 sanskrit ke jin shabdon main visarg kaa prayog hota he, ve yadi tatsam rup main prayukt hon to visarg kaa prayog avashya kiya jaae
 Such as: - In 'sadness'
 yadi us shabd ke tadbhav rup main visarg kaa lop ho chukaa ho to us rup main visarg ke bina bhi kaam chal jayega
 Such as: - 'partner of sorrow and happiness'
 2
7
2 tatsam shabdon ke ant main prayukt visarg kaa prayog anivaary he
 As such: - So, again, automatically, often, completely, basically, finally, literally, respectively, etc
 2

1 Dispersed form should not be written in words such as slack, insular, inferior etc
 2
7
4
2 antahkaran, antahpur, praatavkaal aadi shabd visarg ke saath hi likhe jaaen
 2
7
5 Dispersion should not be used in the words tadbhav / indigenous
 is aadhaar par chah likhnaa galat hoga
 It would be fine to write six
 2
7
6 prayadweep, samaptpraaya aadi shabdon main tatsam rup main bhi visarg nahin he
 2
7
7 Visarga should be written with a letter, while the colon is at some distance from the marked word
 jaise :– atah, yon he :– 2
8
1 should be called light mark and not halant
 vyanjan ke neeche laga hal chihn us vyanjan ke swar rahit hone kii soochna detaa he, yani vah vyanjan vishuddh rup se vyanjan he
 In this way, the word 'jagat' will be called Halant because this word is euphemistic, not a voice
 2
8
2 sanyuktakshar banane ke niyam 2
1
2
2 ke anusaar d chh t th d dh d h main hal chihn kaa hi prayog hoga
 Such as: Chihan, Budha, Vidwan etc
 2
8
3 tatsam shabdon kaa prayog vaanchhneeya ho tab halant roopon kaa hi prayog kiya jaae; vishesh rup se tab jab unase samast pad yaa vyutpann shabd banate hon
 Such as: -, speech-, satt-, bhagavan-, sakshat-, jagat-, tejas-, vyudit- etc
 tatsam sambodhan main he rajan, he bhagwan rup hi sweekrut honge
 In the Hindi style, o King, o God, be written
 jin shabdon main hal chihn lupt ho chukaa ho, unamem use phir se lagane kaa praytn na kiya jaae
 Such as - great, scholar etc; Because in Hindi, forms like 'mahanati' and 'vidwanas' have become popular
 2
8
4 vyakaran granthon main vyanjan sandhi samajhaate hue keval utane hi shabd die jaaen, jo shabd rachana ko samajhane ke liye aavashyak hon yaa arth kii drushti se upyogi hon 
 2
8
5 There does not seem to be any need to explain the disjunction of words like Hridayangam, Uddhan, Sanchit etc
 in Hindi
 isi tarah 'saakshaatkaar', 'jagadish', 'shatkosh' jaise shabdon ke arth ko samajhane kii aavashyaktaa ho tabhi unki sandhi kaa hawala diya jaae
 In Hindi it would be good to accept them as independent words
 2
9
1 sanskritmulak tatsam shabdon kii vartanee ko jyon-kaa-tyon grahan kiya jaae
 Therefore, it would not be appropriate to change 'brahma' to 'brahma', 'sign' to 'symbol', 'urun' to 'urin'
 isi prakaar grahit, drushtavy, pradarshini, atyaadhik, anadhikaar aadi ashuddh prayog grahya nahin hai
 Instead, only the home, writing, exhibition, excessive, unauthorized should be written in their place
 2
9
2 jin tatsam shabdon main teen vyanjanon ke sanyog kii sthiti main ek dwitvamoolak vyanjan lupt ho gaya he use na likhane kii chhot he
 Such as - Ardh> Ardha, Tattva> Element etc
 2
10
1 hindi main i, ou kaa prayog do prakaar ke uccharan ko vyakt karne ke liye hota he
 The first type is pronounced like the original vowels in 'hai', 'and' etc
; While the second type of pronunciation is still safe in words such as 'gawaiya', 'crow', etc
 donon hi prakaar ke uccharanon ko vyakt karne ke liye inhen chihnon kaa prayog kiya jaae
 Modifications such as 'gavayya', 'qava' etc
 are not required
 anya udhaaharan hai :– bhaiya, saiyad, taiyaar, hauva aadi
 2
10
2 The personal names of Iyer, Nayyar, Ramayya etc
 of the south should not be written as Aayar, Nayyar, Ramaiya etc
 according to the Hindi pronunciation, because its pronunciation is different in the native language
 2
10
3 awwal, kavvaal, qawwali jaise shabd prachlit hai
 They should be kept intact in writing
 2
10
4 sanskrit ke tatsam shabd 'shayya' ko 'shaiya' na likhaa jaae
 2
11
1 The past participle suffix should be written by mixing the verb 'kara'
 jaise :– milakar, kha-pikar, ro-rokar aadi
 2
11
2 'tax' will be formed from tax + tax and 'karake' from tax + tax
 2
12
1 kriya roopon main 'karne vaala', 'aane vaala', 'bolne vaala' aadi ko alag likhaa jaae
 Such as: - i am going to go home, people to go
 2
12
2 yojak pratyay ke rup main 'gharavaala', 'topivala', dilavaala, doodhwaala aadi ek shabd ke samaan hi likhe jaayenge
 2
12
3 When 'wala' comes as a suffix, it will be written in accordance with 2
12
2; Otherwise separately
 yah vaala, yah vaali, pehle vaala, acha vaala, laal vaala, kal vaali baat aadi main vaala nirdeshak shabd he
 Therefore, it should be written separately
 isi tarah lambey baalo vaali ladki, dadhi vaala aadmi aadi shabdon main bhi vaala alag likhaa jayega
 From this we can differentiate at the level of composition
 jaise :–gaanwvaala - villager gaanv vaala makaan - village house 2
13
1 Where acclaimed Y, and v are used optionally, the first forms should be used, ie, done, new, new, happened, etc
 yah niyam kriya, visheshan, avyay aadi sabhi roopon or sthitiyon main lagu mana jaae
 Such as: - Shown, for Ram, with book, New Delhi etc
 2
13
2 jahaan 'ya' shrutimulak vyakaranik parivartan na hokar shabd kaa hi mul tatv ho vahaan vaikalpik shrutimulak swaratmak parivartan karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Such as: - Permanent, impersonal, obligation etc
 urdu se aae arabi-farsi mulak ve shabd jo hindi ke ang ban chuke hai or jinaki videshi dhvaniyon kaa hindi dhvaniyon main roopaantar ho chukaa he, hindi rup main hi sweekaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Such as: - pen, fort, stain etc
 par jahaan unka shuddh videshi rup main prayog abhisht ho athwa uccharangat bhed bataanaa aavashyak ho, vahaan unke hindi main prachlit roopon main yathasthaan nukte lagaae jaaen
 Such as: - Food: Food, Raj: Raaz, Fun: Fun etc
 angrezi ke jin shabdon main ardhvivruth 'o' dhwani kaa prayog hota he, unke shuddh rup kaa hindi main prayog abhisht hone par 'aa' kii maatra ke upar ardhachandra kaa prayog kiya jaae 
 As regards the adoption of new words and their Devanāgarī transliteration from English and other foreign languages, Devanāgarī transliteration of international vocabulary was done in august-september, 1962 by the Commission on Scientific and Technical Terminology in the Symposium of Linguists on Scientific Vocabulary
 Recommendation is notable
 usamen yah kaha gaya he ki angrezi shabdon kaa devanagari lipyantaran itnaa clisht nahin hona chahie ki uske vartmaan devanagari varnon main anek nae sanket-chihn lagane paden
 Devanāgarī transliteration of English words should be as close as possible to the standard English pronunciation
 hindi main kuch prachlit shabd aise hai jinaki vartanee ke do-do rup baraabar chal rahe hai
 There is a similar recognition of both forms in Vidvatsamaj
 kuch udhaaharan hai :– gardan / gardan, garmi / garmi, baraf / barf, bilkul / bilkul, sardi / sardi, kursii / kursi, bharti / bhartee, fursat / fursat, bardaasht / bardaasht, waapas / vaapis, aakhirkaar / akhirkaar, baratan / bartan, dubaara / dobaaraa, dukaan / duukaan, beemaari / bimaari aadi
 The first of these alternative forms should be preferred

 In solid geometry, a solid with four plane faces is called a tetrahedron
 chaaron falak tribhujaakar hote hai
 Any three of these panels meet at a point called the 'top'
 chatushfalki main chaar falak, chaar sheersh evam chah kor hotin hai
 The tetrahedron is the simplest solid among the simple convex polyhedron
 chatushfalki ek prakaar kaa pyramid hi he jiskaa aadhaar tribhuj he
 Hence it is also called 'triangular Pyramid'
 sabhi uttal bahufalakiyon kii bhaanti chatushfalki bhi ek hi kaagaj ke tukade se modakar banaayi ja sakati he
 a round plane can be formed through the four heads of any tetrahedron, which is called Parigola
 isi prakaar iske chaaron falkon ko sparsh karata hua bhi ek gol tal banaaya ja saktaa he jise antavgola kehete hai
 a quadrilateral whose all faces are equilateral triangles is called a rhombus
 chatushfalak kaa aaytan Where b { \ displaystyle B} is the area of the base of the quadrilateral and h { \ displaystyle h} is the length of the length inserted from the front of the base on this base
 v = 1 6 | d e t | { \ displaystyle V={ \ frac {1}{6}} \ left|det \ right|} jahaan A, B, c or d chatushfalak ke sheersh hai
 If the length of the core of a rhombus is 'a': janaa jaataa he Note that with respect to the base plane the slope of a face is twice that of an edge, relating to the fact that the horizontal distance covered from the base to the apex along an edge is twice that along the median of a face
 In other words, if c is the centroid of the base, the distance from c to a vertex of the base is twice that from c to the midpoint of an edge of the base

 There are two types of Mansi Seva - maryada-marginal and Pushtirmargiya

 The Bhaktimarga of Shuddhavaitaism philosophy propounded by Vallabhacharya is called Pushtimarga
 shuddhadvaitvaad ke anusaar brahm maaya se alipt he, isaliye shuddh he
 It is Advaita only because of being indulged with Maya
 yah brahm sagun bhi he or nirgun bhi
 The things which seem to be conflicting to the common intelligence, have a simple infatuation in Brahma
 vah anu se bhi chota or sumeru se bhi bada he
 He is still one and many
 yah brahm swadhin hokar bhi bhakt ke adheen ho jaataa he
 Like the Vishayadvaita, the Shuddhadvaita has also told the world the truth along with Brahma
 karanroop brahm ke satya hone par kaaryrup jagat mithyaa nahin ho saktaa
 Because of being a replica of Brahm, the Trikalabadha power of the world
 jeev or jagat kaa naash nahin hota, sirf aavirbhaav or tirbhaav hota he
 Pushtimarga molds the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita into devotion
 pushti kaa shabdic arth he ‘poshan’
 In the Srimad Bhagwat, the grace of God is called nourishment - "nurture accordingly"
 vallabhacharya ke anusaar, “krishnaugraharoopa hi pushtih kaladi baadhak”
 That is, the grace of Krishna, freeing him from the influence of Kaladi, is a confirmation
 pushtimargi bhakthi kaa muladhar bhagawatkrupa or unke prati purna samarpan he
 Even before the devotee turns his attention to the Lord, the Lord pours his grace on the devotee
 krishna kii murali dwaara gopiyon par krupa varsha hoti he
 This Murali grace of Krishna is the communicator
 pushtimaarg main bhakt sway ko purnataya bhagwaan ke aasare chhod detaa he
 In Pushtimarga, three types of organisms are told - flow organism, decimation organism and confirmation organism
 janm maran ke bandhan main bandhe jeev ko ‘pravaah jeev’ kehete hai
 The Jiva who tries to get Brahman knowledge from the study of Vedas, Upanishads etc
 is called 'maryada Jiva' and Jiva makes devotion and affection of God his support, it is called 'confirmation Jiva'
 pushti maarg main bhakthi kii bhi teen prakaar kii avadharanaayen hai- pravaah pushti bhakthi, maryaada pushti bhakthi or shuddh pushti bhakthi
 a devotee tied in the cycle of birth and death under 'flow confirmation devotion' remembers God and attains gradual salvation
 ‘maryaada pushti bhakthi’ ke antargat bhakt shastron se brahm gyaan praapt karne ke baad bhagwaan kii ore unmukh hota he or moksh kii ore badhata he
 In 'pure affirmation devotion' the devotee surrenders himself completely to the Lord's refuge
 yahan bhagwaan apane bachche kii tarah bhakt kaa paalan karte hai
 a devotee who is completely devoted at the feet of God becomes a part of the Lord's affection
 shuddh pushti bhakt kii mukti sabase shuddh, saral or sugam hoti he
 All the sorrows of the devotee disappear once they come under the shelter of God
 pushti margi bhakthi ko maadhurya bhakthi, premabhakti yaa raganuga bhakthi kehete hai
 In this devotion, there is a spiritual adaptation of the form of dressing
 yahan bhagwaan krishna bhakt ke ekmaatr avlamban hote hai, jabaki jeev or gopiyaan aashray
 There are three stages of devotional development - love, attachment and addiction

 The idealistic thinker Green has an important place in the history of Rajadarshan

 He gave a new religious belief to modern liberalism, made individualism moral and social and balanced and refined idealism
 unhone apane darshan main vyakti tathaa rajya donon ko mahatva diya
 Vaper's intent is correct that Green gave the British more satisfaction than Benthamism

 T॰H Green was born on 7 April 1836 in a place called Birkin in Yorkshire district

 Green has made his invaluable contribution to the history of political thought by writing in a sequential manner
 uske jeevankaal main uski koi rachana prakashit nahin hui
 Therefore, RL Nettleship published his works in three parts, being the most beloved disciple on Green
 uski adhikansh rachanaayen darshanashastra or nitivishyak hai
 His important compositions are the following: is prakaar green ne apni rachanaaon main nitishastra, darshanashastra tathaa raajnneetishastra sambandhi vichaar prastut kiye hai
 Green's philosophy is inspired by the spirit of spirit, just like Hegel
 green ne is tatva ko shaashvat chaitanya kaha he
 Greene has a special influence in creating this idea, Greek philosophy, Russo philosophy, German idealism etc
 green ke darshanik prerana-strot nimnlikhit hai :- Thus we can say that Greene had a wide influence on Greek philosophy, Russo's philosophy, German idealism and the antagonists which later became evident in his compositions

 khaskar 'poster' main agar lokdharmita he to 'komal gandhar' main sukumaar samvednaa or charitron kii aantarikta
 a different type of echoes will be found in each of his plays
 'ek or dronacharya' unka sabase lokapriy naatak tha jisaki 30 se adhik prastutiyon ke vivaran uplabdh hai
 In Kanpur, several cultural institutions including Anukriti performed around 50 performances of Dronacharya, though the 50th successful staging was done by Anukriti itself
 yah naatak atyadhik lokapriyata ke baavjood hameshaa vivaadaaspad bhi rahaa
 The Marxist critic Shankar does not agree with Seshi's narrative and the new director does not want to present his work without often editing it, because in his view the play has become more of a sentiment, mystery and a miracle of film gloom

 Sant Kulbhushan poet Sant Shiromani Ravidas was a pioneer among the great saints who through his creations contributed significantly in removing the evils prevailing in the society
 inaki rachanaaon kii visheshta lok-vaani kaa adbhut prayog rahi he jisase janamanas par inkaa amit prabhaav padataa he
 The voice of the sweet and simple sage Shiromani Raidas is like a bridge between the knowledgeable and the romantic branches
 prachinkaal se hi bharat main vibhinn dharmon tathaa maton ke anuyaayi nivas karte rahe hai
 In all these, the saints have contributed significantly from time to time to increase harmony and brotherhood
 aise santon main shiromani raidas kaa naam agraganya he
 He was Gurubhai of Sant Kabir because he also had Guru Swami Ramanand
 inaki yaad main magh purna ko ravidaas jayanti manaai jaati hai
 Guru Ravidas ji was born in Kashi

 Raidas had gained sufficient practical knowledge from the association of saints and saints

 Ravidas ji was very benevolent and kind from the beginning and it became his nature to help others
 sadhu-santon kii sahaayta karne main unako vishesh anand miltaa tha
 They used to give them shoes without paying any price
 unke swabhaav ke kaaran unke mata-pita unase aprasann rahete the
 After some time he drove Ravidas and his wife away from their home
 ravidaas ji pados main hi apane liye ek alag imaarat banaakar tatparta se apane vyavsaay kaa kaam karte the or shesh samay ishwar-bhajan tathaa sadhu-santon ke satsang main vyateet karte the
 The small events of his life reveal his qualities related to the observance of time and speech
 ek baar ek parv ke avasar par pados ke log ganga-snaan ke liye ja rahe the
 When one of the disciples of Raidas urged them to walk too, they said, i must walk for Ganga-bathing, but today i have promised to make shoes for a person
 yadi main use aaj juute nahin de sakaa to vachan bhang hoga
 When Ganga goes to bathe, if the mind remains here then how will it attain virtue? It is advisable to do whatever the mind is prepared to do with the inner conscience
 man sahi he to ise kathaute ke jal main hi gangasnan kaa punya praapt ho saktaa he
 It is said that after this kind of practice, the proverb became popular - that if the mind is healed, the Ganges is in disarray
 raidas ne oonch-neech kii bhaavana tathaa ishwar-bhakthi ke naam par kiye jane vaale vivaad ko saraheen tathaa nirarthak bataaya or sabko paraspar miljul kar prempurvak rahane kaa upadesh diya
 He himself composed melodious and devotional hymns and used to recite them passionately
 unka vishwaas tha ki ram, krishna, kareem, raghav aadi sab ek hi parameshwar ke vividh naam hai
 In the Vedas, Quran, Puranas etc
 the same God is praised
 krisn, kareem, ram, hari, raghav, jab lag ek na pekha
 Ved Qateb saw Quran, Puranan, Sahaj one
 
 He believed that devotion to God, observance of virtue, goodwill and good behavior is essential
 abhimaan tyaag kar dusron ke saath vyavhaar karne or vinamrata tathaa shishtataa ke gunon kaa vikaas karne par unhone bahut bal diya
 In one of his hymns, he has said- kah raidas teri bhagati doori he, bhaag bade so paavai
 On the public pride mete, the public is selected
 unke vichaaron kaa aashay yahi he ki ishwar kii bhakthi bade bhagya se praapt hoti he
 a person working without pride is successful in life, as the giant elephant is unable to pick up the sugar particles, while the small body papilla easily selects these particles
 isi prakaar abhimaan tathaa badppan kaa bhav tyaag kar vinamratapurvak aacharan karne vaala manushya hi ishwar kaa bhakt ho saktaa he
 Raidas's voice was filled with true feelings of devotion, desire for the larger interest of society and human love
 isliye uskaa shrotaaon ke man par gaharaa prabhaav padataa tha
 His hymns and sermons gave people such education that a satisfactory solution to their doubts was made and people automatically became their followers
 unki vaani kaa itnaa vyapak prabhaav padaa ki samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke log unke prati shraddhalu ban gayi
 It is said that Meerabai was very impressed by his devotion and became his disciple

 Even today the teachings of Sant Raidas are very important for the welfare and upliftment of the society
 unhone apane aacharan tathaa vyavhaar se yah pramanit kar diya he ki manushya apane janm tathaa vyavsaay ke aadhaar par mahaan nahin hota he
 Only qualities like superiority of ideas, work inspired by the spirit of the interest of society and good behavior are helpful in making a man great
 inhen gunon ke kaaran sant raidas ko apane samay ke samaaj main atyadhik sammaan mila or isi kaaran aaj bhi log inhen shraddhapurvak samaran karte hai
 Raidas Manush could not join till caste was formed
