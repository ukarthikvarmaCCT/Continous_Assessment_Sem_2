 Gallium is a chemical element

 Gallium shares the high-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that include water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium
 gallium hamalon dhaatu jaali main diffusing se adhikansh anya dhaatuon
 For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminum, zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle

 The melting point of gallium, at 302
9146 K, is just above room temperature, and is almost the same as the average summer daytime temperature in the middle latitudes of the Earth

 The physical properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, together with the three major crystallographical axes A, B, and C, creating a significant difference between the linear and volume thermal expansion coefficients that do not have distinct values
 gallium ke gunon ko vishesh rup se pighalane bindu ke paas, dridhtaa se taapmaana par nirbhar kar rahe hai
 For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting
 rasinic gunayah bhi dekhen: shrenee: gallium yogicon
 Gallium is mainly found in the 3 oxidation state

 For example, very stable gacl2 is involved in both gallium and gallium and can be prepared as gaigaiiicl4; In contrast, monochloride is unstable above 0 ° c disproportionating into elemental gallium and gallium chloride

 Some of these colors, the chemicals used in them and their effects on health are as follows
 kaala rang lead oxide se banataa he, jisase gurde ko haani va larning disability ho sakati he
 Green color is made of copper sulphate, which can cause eye allergies and temporary blindness
 purple rang chromium iodide se banataa he jisase bronkiyal dama va allergy ho sakate hai
 The silver color is made from aluminum bromide, which can become a cancer factor

 Red color is formed from mercury sulfate, which makes skin cancer and mental retardation possible
 sookhe gulaal main esbestus yaa silica milaai jaati he jisase asthma, twachaa main sacrunman or ankhon main jalan kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 Apart from these, adulterated and chemically inferior colors can also contain diesel, chromium, iodine, engine oil and lead powder which can cause serious health problems

 ek puranic katha ke anusaar, jwarasuraka janm chintnamay shivaji ke lalatake pasinese hua tha or vah devataaon ke liye ek khatra tha
 Once Vishnu had incarnated Hayagrivaka, he was suffering from fever fever
 isliye unhone daanav jwarasurako maar daalaa
 He cut it into three pieces with his Sudarshan Chakra
 haalanki, brahmae jwarasuraka punerjeevit kar diya or uske tino hisson ko jod diya
 But at that time the head and limb of each of its three parts had developed
 is prakaar jwarasur teen chehre or teen pairo vaala dikhaai detaa he or ek hi baar main sabhi dishaao main sthanantarit karne kii ek asaadhaaran kshamta rakhata he
 He was later chosen as the spouse of Sheetla Devi
 
 According to another legend, Goddess Durga incarnated as Goddess Katyayani and killed many demons sent by Kalkeya
 jwarasur naamake bukhaarake daanavne, katyayanike bachapan ke dostomen laailaaj bimaariyaan jaise kii haija, atisar, khasra, chechak jaise rog failaana shuru kar diya
 Hence Katyayani treated his sick friends
 uske baad puri duniyaako bukhaar or rogonse raahat dene ke liye katyayanine sheetala devika rup liya
 One of his four hands holds a small broom in one hand, a fan in the other hand, a pot of cold water in the third hand and a cup of drink in the fourth hand
 unhone apni shakti kaa istemaal sabhi bacchon ke rogon ke ilaaj karne ke liye kiya
 Katyayani then urged his friend Batuku to go out and make war with the demon Jyvasura
 isliye yuva batuka or daanav jwarasur ke bich yuddh shuru ho gaya
 The demon Jauravasur succeeded in defeating Batukko
 uske baad batuka mrit gir pada
 Jowasur was surprised as Batuk was not visible anywhere
 par usko pataa hi nahi chalaa kii batukane ek bhayanak purushaka rup le liya tha
 This man had three eyes and four hands

 His color was dark like black

 Eyes were burning with anger unhone baagh kii twachaa ore khopadioki malas pahani thi
 Batukne took the form of Kalabhairavaka, a terrible avatar of Shiva
 uske baad kalbhairav jwarasuraki ninda karte he or usko bataate ki vah maan durga devi ke sevak he
 There is a long debate between them, but then it turns into a fight
 jwarasur apni shaktike madhyam se kai rakshason utpnan hue, lekin sabhi ko kalbhairavane nasht kar diya
 In the end, Kalabhairav wrestled with Jyavasura and later killed him with his trident
 sheetala devi-jwarasur kaa panth bengali samskritimein vyapak rup se lokapriy he
 Incidentally, in Bengali, Oriya and Hindi languages, Bukharko is known as Jawara and Asura means demon
 jwarasuraka naam do shabdon kaa ek sangyojan he
 - Jawara and Asura - Jyvasura
 is prakaar, jwarasur bukhaarka rakshas he
 It is said that Sheetla Devi and Jyavasura travel together on their donkeys
 jwarasur yuvan sevakke rup main hai
 The people of all the villages of northern India, Jaurasurki's wife Shitala Devi are worshiped as guardians of smallpox and fever
 
 In Buddhist culture, Jyāुरasurko is shown as Parnāshabari Pati

 razia sultan kii samadhi / kabr, Razia al-din, the royal name "jalolat ud-din Raziyo", commonly known as "razia Sultan" or "razia Sultana" in history, was the Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate
 razia ne 1236 se 1240 tak dilli sultanate par shashan kiya
 She was the daughter of Iltutmish

 Iltutmish was the first ruler who appointed a woman to succeed him
 
lekin, muslim varg ko iltutamish kaa kisi mahila ko vaaris bananaa naamanzur tha, isliye uski mrityu ke pashchaat uske chote bete raknuddin firoz shah ko rajsinghaasana par baithaaya gaya
 The rule of Raknuddin, for a very short period of time, was no longer controlled by Iltutmish's widow, Shah Turkan

 iske pashchaat sultan ke liye anya kisi vikalp ke abhaav main musalamaanon ko ek mahila ko shashan kii bagdor deni padi
 
 or razia sultan dilli kii shasika ban gai
 Razia's interest in governance was from the time of her father's rule
 gaddi sanbhaalane ke baad razia ne ritiriwaazon ke vipareet purushon kii tarah sainikon kaa kot or pagadi pahananaa pasand kiya
 Rather, the war later involved wearing a mask
 razia ne pardaa pratha kaa tyaag kar purashon ki tarah choga kulah pahanakar darbar main khule munh jane lagi Razia used to take care of the army and the general public with her political prudence and policies
 vah dilli kii sabase shaktishaalee shaasha ban gayin thim
 Muslims also did not like the intimate relationship that was developing with Razia and her mentor, jamaat-ud-din-yakut, a Habshi
 razia ne is par paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya
 , But his underestimating the outcome of this relationship proved fatal for his state
 kuch sroton ke anusaar, razia or yakut premi the; anya sroton ke anusaar ve donon kareebi dost / vishwaas paatr the
 All this Razia gave birth to Ishiya in the Turkish class, because, Yakub, was not a Turk and he was appointed by Razia as an officer of the horse
