 In fact the organization can be considered as the distinguishing feature that distinguishes civilized society from uncivilized society
 prabandh ke prarambh ke vyavhaar ve niyam evam kanoon the jo sarkari evam vanijyik kriyaaon ke anubhav se panape
 Principles and practices of management developed with the development of trade and commerce respectively
 ‘prabandh’ shabd aaj kai arthon main prayukt hota he jo isaki prakruti ke vibhinn pahaluon ko ujagar karte hai
 The study of management has developed along with modern organizations in the past
 yah prabandhakon ke anubhav evam aacharan tathaa siddhanton ke sambadh samooh donon par aadhaarit rahaa he
 In the past, it has developed into a dynamic subject
 jisaki apni vishisht visheshtaayen hai
 But it is necessary to answer a question related to the nature of management whether management is science or art or both
 To answer this, let us study the characteristics of both science and art and see how far the management fulfills them
 kala kya he? kala icchit parinaamon ko paane ke liye vartmaan gyaan kaa vyaktigat evam dakshatapurna upyog he
 It can be obtained through study, observation and experience
 ab kyonki kala kaa sambandh gyaan ke vyaktigat upyog se he isliye adhyayan kiye gaye moolbhoot siddhanton ko vyavhaar main laane ke liye ek prakaar kii moulikta evam rachanaatmakataa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The basic characteristics of art are as follows- kala yah maanakar chalati he ki kuch saidhantik gyaan pehle se he
 Experts in their respective fields have proposed some basic principles that are used in a particular type of art
 udhaaharan ke liye nrity, jan sambodhan / bhaashan, kala athwa sangeet par sahitya sarvamaanya he
 Use of this basic knowledge varies from person to person
 kala, isiilie atyant vyaktigat avadharana he
 For example, two dancers, two speakers, two artists or two writers will differ in the performance of their art
 sabhi kala vyavhaarik hoti hai
 Art is the creative use of knowledge to current principles
 ham jaanate hai ki sangeet saat suron par aadhaarit he
 But the music composition of a musician is unique or different, it depends on how these notes are used in music creation, which is its own interpretation
 prabandh ek kala he kyonki, yah nimna visheshtaon ko puraa karti he- a manager is a hierarchical knowledge group that clarifies any general truths or general principles
 The basic characteristics of science are as follows: vigyaan, gyaan kaa krambaddh samooh he
 Its principles are based on the relation between cause and consequence
 udhaaharan ke liye, ped se seb kaa tuutakar prithvi par aane kii ghatana gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ko janm detii he
 Scientific theories are first developed through observation and then tested and tested under controlled conditions repeatedly
 vaigyanik siddhant, vaidhata evam upyog ke liye saarvbhaumik hote hai
 On the basis of the above characteristics, we can say that as a management science, it has certain characteristics- sabhi prakaar kii sanghathan prakriyaaon kaa prabandhan aavashyak he
 You must also have observed that organizations require certain qualifications and experience to manage them
 aapane yah bhi paaya hoga ki ek ore to vyavsaay nigamit swaroop main vruddhi hui he to duusari ore vyavsaay ke prabandh par adhik jor diya ja rahaa he
 Does this mean that management is a profession? To know the answer to this question, let us study the salient features of the profession and see if the management fulfills them
 peshey kii nimna visheshtaayen hai All professions are based on a well-defined set of knowledge that can be acquired through education
 peshey main pravesh, pariksha athwa shaikshanik yogyata ke dwaara simit hoti he
 For example, in India, if one wants to become a Chartered Accountant, one has to pass a special examination conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
 sabhi peshey kisi na kisi parishad sabha se jude hote hai jo inamen pravesh kaa niyaman karte hai kaary karne ke liye pramaan patr jari karte hai evam aadhaar samhita taiyaar karte hai tathaa usko lagu karte hai
 To advocate in India, lawyers have to become members of the Bar Council which regulates and controls their actions
 sabhi peshey aachaar samhita se bandhe hai jo unke sadasyon ke vyavhaar ko disha dete hai
 For example, when doctors enter their profession, they take an oath of their work ethic
 peshey kaa mul uddeshy nishtha evam patibaddhta he tathaa apane graahakon ke hiton kii sadhana he
 a lawyer ensures that his client gets justice
 prabandh, peshey ke siddhanton ko puri tarah se puraa nahin karata he
 Well it has some characteristics which are as follows- prabandh ek saarvbhaumik shabd he jise, kisi udhyam main sambandhon ke samooh main ek duusare se jude logon dwaara kuch kaaryon ko karne ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Everyone has the responsibility to complete a particular task in this chain of relationships
 is uttardaayitv ko puraa karne ke liye use kuch adhikaar die jate hai arthath nirnay lene kaa adhikaar
 This relationship of authority and responsibility binds individuals to each other as officers and subordinates
 isse sanghathan main vibhinn staron kaa nirmaan hota he
 There are three levels in the authority chain of an organization- ucch stareey prabandh-yah sanghathan ke varishthatam kaaryakari adhikari hote hai jinhen kai naamon se pukaara jaataa he
 It is commonly known as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Head, Deputy Principal etc
 ucch prabandh, vibhinn kaaryaatmak str ke prabandhakon kii team hoti he
 Their basic task is to keep the overall objectives of the organization in mind, to unify the various elements and harmonize the work of different departments
 ucch str ke ye prabandhak sanghathan ke kalyaan evam nirantarata ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 They analyze the environment of the business and its impact for the life of the firm
 ye apni uplabdhi ke nae sanghathan ke lakshya evam vyuh-rachana ko taiyaar karte hai
 They are responsible for all the functions of business and their impact on society
 ucch prabandh kaa kaary jatil evam tanaavpurn hota he
 It takes a long time, so full commitment to the organization is required
 madhya stareey prabandh- ye ucch prabandhakon evam neeche str ke bich kii kadi hote hai, ye ucch prabandhakon ke adhinsth evam pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke pradhan hote hai
 They are commonly called department heads, operations managers or plant superintendents
 madhya stareey prabandhak, ucch prabandh dwaara viksit niyantran yojanaayen evam vyuh-rachana ke kriyanvayan ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 In addition, they are responsible for all the functions of first-line managers
 inkaa mukhya kaary ucch stareey prabandhakon dwaara taiyaar yojanaon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 For this paryvekshiya athwa prachaalan prabandhak- sanghathan kii adhikaar pankti main forman evam paryvekshak nimna str par aate hai
 Supervisors directly observe the work of the workforce
 inke adhikaar evam karttavya ucch prabandhakon dwaara banaai gai yojanaon dwaara nirdhaarit hoti hai
 Supervision, managers have an important role in the organization as they communicate directly with the actual work force and communicate the guidelines of middle level managers to the employees
 inhen ke prayatnon se utpaada kii gunvattta ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he, maal kii haani ko nunatam rakhaa jaataa he evam suraksha ke str banaae rakhaa jaataa he
 The quality of workmanship, and mere production, depends on the hard work, discipline and loyalty of the employees
 prabandh ko sanghathan se sadasyon se kaaryon ke niyojan, sanghathan, nideshan evam niyantran evam nirdhaarit uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sanghathan ke sansadhano ke prayog kii prakriya mana gaya he
 It is already the task of determining what to do, how and who to do
 iskaa arth he uddeshyon ko pehle se hi nishchit karnaa evam dakshata se evam prabhavi dhang se praapt karne ke liye maarg nirdhaarit karnaa
 The purpose of Suhasini's organization is to buy and sell traditional Indian handloom and handicrafts items
 vah bune hue vastra, sajaavat kaa saamaan, paramparaagat bhartiya kapade se taiyaar vastra evam gharelu saamaan ko bechate hai

 It manages the task of assigning tasks, dividing tasks into groups, assigning rights and allocation of resources for the implementation of the prescribed plan
 ek baar sanghathan ke uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye vishisht yojana taiyaar kar lee jaati he to phir sanghathan yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye aavashyak kriyaaon evam sansadhano kii jaanch karegaa

 yah nirnay letaa he ki kis kaary ko koun karegaa, inhen kahan kiya jayega tathaa kab kiya jayega
 Necessary tasks in the organization are divided into the departments and work units capable of management and the relationship of giving rights and details in the authority chain of the organization is determined
 sanghathan ke uchit takanic kaary ke puraa karne evam prachaalan kii kaary kshamta evam parinaamon kii prabhaav purnataa ke sanvardhan main sahaayta karte hai
 Different types of businesses require different frameworks according to the nature of work
 iske sambandh main aap aage ke adhyyon main or adhik padhenge
 In simple terms it means finding the right person for the right job
 prabandh kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu sanghathan ke uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sahi yogyata vaale sahi vyaktiyon ko, sahi sthaan evam samay par uplabdh karaane ko sunishchit karnaa he
 It is also called human resource work and includes recruitment, selection, appointment and training of employees
 infosis technology, jo sofratware viksit karti he, ko pranali vishleshankartta evam kaarykram taiyaar karne vaale vyaktiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jabaki labmart ko dizinkartta evam shilpakaaron ke team kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The task of directing is to provide leadership, influence and motivation to the employees so that they can complete the assigned work
 iske liye ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he jo karmchaariyon ko sarvshereshth dhang se kaary karne ke liye prerit kare
 There are two basic elements of motivation and leadership
 karmchaariyon ko abhiprerit karne kaa arth keval ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar karnaa he jo unhen kaary ke liye prerit kare
 Leadership means influencing others in such a way that they perform the desired tasks of their leader
 ek acha prabandhak prashansa evam aalochana kii sahaayta se is prakaar se nirdesan karata he ki karmchaaree apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Suhasini's team of designers developed ravishing colors on silk for bed sheets
 yadhyapi yah bahut lubhaavne lagate the lekin silk ke prayog ke kaaran aam aadmi ke liye yah bahut adhik mahange the
 Praising her work, Suhasini suggested that she keep these silk sheets for special occasions like Deepawali, Christmas and print them regularly on cotton clothes
 niyantran ko prabandh ke kaary ke us rup main paribhaashit kiya he jisamen vah sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sanghathan kaary ke nishpaadan ko nirdeshit karata he
 Levels of execution are determined in the control function, the current performance is measured
 iskaa purvanirdhaarit staron se milan kiya jaataa he or vichlan kii sthiti main sudharatmak kadam uthaae jate hai
 For this, managers have to determine what work and production are important for success, how and where it can be measured and who is authorized to take corrective steps
 suhasini ne jab paaya ki uske dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii vah chadar banaai jo unki vikray ke liye nishchit mulya se adhik mahangi thi tab usne laagat par niyantran ke liye chadar hetu kapadaa hi badal diya
 The various functions of the manager are usually discussed in the above order according to which a manager prepares the plan first; Then creates organization; Thereafter directs; And finally controls
 vastav main prabandhak shaayad hi in kaaryon ko ek-ek karke karata he
 The tasks of the manager are related to each other and it becomes difficult to determine which work ended where and which work started from where
 kisi sanghathan ke prabandhan kii prakriya main ek prabandhak ko paanch ek duusare se sambandhit kaary karne hote hai
 Organization is a system that is made up of interconnected and interconnected subsets
 prabandhak ko in bhinn samoohon ko samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye ek duusare se jodna hota he
 The process of monotony of activities of different departments is called coordination
 samanvay vah shakti he jo, prabandh ke anya sabhi kaaryon ko ek duusare se baandhti he
 It is a thread that threads all functions such as purchasing, production, sales and finance to maintain consistency in the work of the organization
 samanvay ko kabhi-kabhi prabandh kaa ek alag se kaary mana jaataa he
 But it is the essence of management because it brings unity in individual efforts to achieve collective goals
 prayek prabandhkeey kaary ek aisi gatividhi he jo swayan akeli samanvay main sahyog karti he
 Coordination is targeted and embedded in all the functions of any organization
 sanghathan kii kriyaaon ke samanvay kii prakriya, niyojan se hi prarambh ho jaati he
 Higher management plans for the entire organization
 in yojanaon ke anusaar sanghathan dhaanchon ko viksit kiya jaataa he evam karmchaariyon kii niyukti kii jaati he
 Implementation of schemes is required according to plan to ensure that guidance is required
 vaastavik kriyaaon evam unki uplabdhiyon main yadi koi matbhed he to iskaa niraakaran niyantran ke samay kiya jaataa he
 Through the process of co-ordination, the management makes proper arrangements for individual and collective efforts to ensure unity in the steps taken to achieve the same objectives, the co-ordination will unify the different functions and efforts of different units of the organization
 is
 yah prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa raashi, maatr, samay evam krambaddhata uplabdh karaata he jo niojit uddeshyon ko nunatam virodhabhas, praapt karne ko sunishchit karata he
 The following characteristics of coordination are clear from the above definitions- samanvay samuhik kaaryon main ekaatmakataa laata he- samanvay aise hiton ko jo ek duusare se sambandhit nahin hai yaa ek duusare se bhinn hai uddeshy purna kaary gatividhi main ekta laata he
 It provides a focal point to the group's actions, which ensures that the execution is in accordance with the plan and schedule
 samanvay kaarywahi main ekta laata he- samanvay kaa uddeshy samaan uddeshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kaarywahi main ekta laana he
 It serves as the power to connect various departments and ensures that all actions are taken to achieve the goals of the organization
 aapane paaya ki labmart ke utpaadan evam vikray vibhaagon ko apane kaaryon main samanvay karnaa hota he jisase ki bazaar kii maang ke anusaar utpaadan kiya ja sake
 Coordination is a continuous process - Coordination is not a one-time function but a continuous process
 yah niyojan se prarambh hota he evam niyantran tak chalati he
 Suhasini makes a plan regarding clothes for winter time in the month of June itself
 tatpashchaat vah paryaapt kaarybal kii vyavastha karti he
 According to the production plan, it is constantly monitored for this, it will have to tell its marketing department in time to prepare for the promotion of sales promotion and advertising
 samanvay sarvyaapee kaary he- vibhinn vibhaagon kii kriyaayein prakruti se ek duusare par nirbhar karti hai isiilie samanvay kii aavashyaktaa prabandh ke sabhi staron par hoti he
 It establishes unity in various departments and functions at different levels
 sanghathan ke uddeshy bana virodh aa sake, praapt karne ke liye suhasini ko kray, utpaadan evam vikray vibhaagon ke kaaryon main samanvay karnaa hota he
 The task of purchasing department is to buy cloth
 yah utpaadan vibhaag kii kriyaaon ke liye aadhaar ban jaataa he or ant main vikray sambhav ho paata he
 If the fabric is of inferior quality or does not have the specifications prescribed by the production department, then further sales will be reduced
 yadi samanvay nahin he to kriyaaon main ekta evam ekikaran ke sthaan par punrariti evam avyavashtha hogi
 Coordination is the responsibility of all managers - coordination is the task of every manager in any organization
 Higher level managers coordinate with their subordinates to ensure that the organization's policies are implemented
 madhyastar ke prabandhak, ucchstar ke prabandhakon evam pratham pankti ke prabandhakon, donon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Operations level managers coordinate the tasks of their employees to ensure that the work is done according to plans
 samanvay sochaa-samajha kaary he- ek prabandhak ko vibhinn logon ke kaaryon kaa dhyanpurvak evam soch samajhakar samanvay karnaa hota he
 In a department, members work voluntarily in cooperation with each other, coordination coordinates this spirit of cooperation
 samanvay ke na hone par sahyog bhi nirarthak siddh hoga or bina sahyog ke samanvay karmchaariyon main asantosh ko hi janm degaa
 Therefore we can say that coordination is not a separate function of management but it is its essence
 yadi koi sanghathan apane uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam kushalta se praapt karnaa chahta he to use samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Coordination is an integral part of all the functions of coordination in the same way as the thread in the rosary
 vibhinn prabandhkeey kaaryon ko ekikrut karnaa vyaktiyon evam vibhaagon main paryaapt maatr main samanvay ko sunishchit karata he
 As such, the constant change inherent in a large-scale organization due to coordination problems is weak or passive leadership and complexities
 bade sanghathanon main is prakaar kii jatiltaaon ke samanvay ke liye vishesh prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Size of organization - Large number of people engaged in large organizations complicate the problem of coordination
 prayek vyakti apane aap main vishisht he
 And realizes the needs of himself and the organization
 prayek kii apni kaary karne kii aadaten hai, apni prishthbhumi hai, paristhitiyon se nipatane ke prastaav / tareeke hai tathaa dusron se sambandh hai
 By the way, a single person does not always act wisely
 uske vyavhaar ko na to sadaa thik se samajha jaataa he or na hi puri tarah se uskaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, for the efficiency of the organization, it is essential that the objectives of the individual and the group are integrated by coordination
 kaaryaatmak vibhedikaran- sanghathan ke kaaryon ko baar-baar vibhaagon, prabhaagon, virgon aadi main baanta jaataa he
 The problem of coordination arises because the jurisdiction becomes stronger and the barriers between them become even stronger
 kai baar yah isliye hota he kyonki kaaryon kaa vargeekaran yukti sangat nahin hota yaa phir prabandhak tark sangat maarg na apana kar anubhav kaa maarg apanaate hai
 In such cases, coordination is necessary to function effectively in the organization
 vishishtikaran- aadhunik sanghathanon main ucch str kaa vishishtikaran he
 Specialization is born due to the intricacies and functions of modern technologies and the diversity of those who do them
 visheshgy sochate hai ki ve ek duusare ko peshey ke aadhaar par jaanchne ke yogya hai lekin duusare logon ke paas is prakaar ke nirnay kaa koi paryaapt aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 If experts are allowed to work without coordination in front of a global manager, the results will be very expensive
 isiilie sanghathan main lage vibhinn visheshgyon ke kaaryon main samanvay hetu ek rachana tantra kii aavashyaktaa he
 Coordination is the essence of management
 yah kuch aisa nahin he taki jiske liye ek prabandhak aadesh de
 Rather it is something that a manager tries to achieve by planning, organizing, appointing, directing control tasks
 atah prayek kaary samanvay kaa abhyaas he
 Organization and their management is changing
 jaise-jaise vibhinn samskritiyon evam deshon kii seemayen dhundhlee pad rahi hai evam sampreshan kii nayi-nayi takneekon ke kaaran vishwa ko ek vaishvik gaanv samajha ja saktaa he
 International and intercultural relations are also growing rapidly
 aaj kaa sanghathan ek vaishvik sanghathan he jiskaa prabandh bhumandaleey paridrishy main kiya jaataa he
 In summary, one can say that a global manager is one who has both 'hard' and 'soft' skills
 jo prabandhak vishleshan karnaa, vyuharachna karnaa, ejineering evam praudyogiki kaa gyaan rakhte hai unki aaj bhi aavashyaktaa he lekin vishwavyaapee safalataa ke liye vyaktiyon main team kaise kaary karti he, sanghathan kaise kaary karte hai evam logon ko kis prakaar se abhiprerit kar saktaa he, is sabaki samaj kaa hona bahut aavashyak he
 For example, a manager who has access to different cultures can work in Western Europe, a non-english speaking country, then move to developing countries like Malaysia or Kenya and then to an office in New York, USA
 Can be transferred
 vah in teenon sthanon par turant prabhavi dhang se kaary kar sakegaa
 The role of global manager has evolved in the same way that global industry and economy have developed
 yah ek paribhaashit vyavsaay ke sandarbh main ek aiami bhoomika se bahuaiami bhoomika main parivartit ho gaya he jiske liye takneekee kaushal, sofrat prabandh evam kaushal evam vibhinn samskritiyon ko grahan karnaa evam seekhney ke sammishran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 He is considered one of the skilled and famous generals in history
 apni mrityu tak vah un sabhi bhoomi me se lagbhag aadhi bhoomi jeet chukaa tha, jisaki jaankaree pracheen greek logon ko thi or uske vijay rath ko rokane main sabase mukhya bhoomika bharat ke mahaan raja puru or bharat ke kshetreey saradaaron kii thi, jinhone sikandar kii sena main apane parakram ke dam par bharat ke prati khauf paidaa kar uske hausale post kar diye or use bharat se lautne par majaboor kar diya
 He conquered territories in Iran, Syria, Egypt, Masopotamia, Finland, Judea, Gaza, Bactria, and India up to Punjab during his tenure, but later returned fearing the vast army of Magadha

 At the same time Philip waged war against Bezantium, leaving Alexander in charge of the kingdom
 philip kii anupasthiti ke dauraan, thresian maidi ne macidonia ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Alexander immediately launched a campaign against him and drove him out of his territory

 Philip returns, sending Alexander there with a small military force to suppress the rebellion in southern Thrace
 unani shahar perinthus ke khilaaf ladaai ke dauraan, sikandar ne apane pita kii jaan bachaai thi
 While still occupied in Thrace, Philip ordered Alexander to set up an army for an expedition into southern Greece

 Meanwhile, Illyrias invaded Macedonia, which Alexander drove back

 Philip then returned to Ilesia, from where he sent a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, which were both rejected
 philip ne dakshin kii ore kooch kii, jahaan uske virodhiyon ne use cheronia, boesia ke paas roak liya

 haalanki, aisa prathit hota he ki philip ne kabhi bhi apane raajnneetijna or sainya prashikshit bete ko asweekaar nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Accordingly, Alexander returns to Macedonia after six months due to the efforts of Demratus, a family friend

 Instead of using diplomacy, Alexander marched south towards Thistley, forming a 3,000 Macedonian cavalry

 from the perspective of relevance
 acharya ramchandra shukla kaa janm san
 1884 main basti jile ke agona naamak gaanv main hua tha
 When the father Pt Chandrabali Shukla was appointed as Sadar Kanungo in Mirzapur, the whole family came to live there
 jis samay shukla ji kii avasthaa nau varsh kii thi, unki mata kaa dehanth ho gaya
 The lack of maternal happiness as well as the grief from Vimata made her personality mature at a young age
 adhyayan ke prati lagnshiltaa shukla ji main balykaal se hi thi
 But they could not find a favorable environment for this
 mirzapur ke landan mishan skool se 1901 main skool final pariksha uteern kii
 His father's wish was that Shukla ji should go to the office and learn office work, but Shukla ji wanted to get higher education
 pita ji ne unhen vakaalat padhane ke liye elahabaad bheja par unki ruchi vakaalat main na hokar sahitya main thi
 So the result was that they failed in it
 shukla ji ke pitaaji ne unhen naayab tehsildaari kii jagah dilaane kaa prayaas kiya, kintu unki swabhimani prakruti ke kaaran yah sambhav na ho sakaa
 From 1903 to 1908 served as the assistant editor of 'anand Kadambini'

 sampadit granthon main hindi shabdhsagar, nagari prachaarini patrika, bhramaragit saar, sur, tulsi jaaysi granthawali ullekhneey he
 Shukla ji has often written literary and psychological essays
 saahitiyik nibandhon ke 3 bhaag kiye ja sakate hai - Theoretical critical essay - 'what is poetry'
 'kavy main lok mangal kii sadhnavastha', 'saadhaaraneekaran or vyakti vaichiyavaad', aadi niabandh saidhdantik aalochana ke antargat aate hai
 Along with criticism, the tendency to explore and explore is also ample in Shukla ji
 'hindi sahitya kaa itihaas' unki isi pravriti kaa parinaam he
 Practical critical essays - Essays like Bharatendu Harishchandra, Bhakti Marg of Tulsi, Dharma Bhoomi of Manas etc
 come under practical criticism
 manovaigyanik niabandh- manovaigyanik nibandhon main karunaa, shradhdha, bhakthi, lajja, glani, krodh, lobh, priti aadi bhaavon tathaa manovikaron par likhe gaye niabandh aate hai
 These psychological essays of Shukla Ji are absolutely original
 unki bhaanti kisi bhi anya lekhak ne uparyukt vishyon par itani praudhata ke saath nahin likhaa
 Shukla ji's essays have complete inclination for her interest, thought stream studies etc
 ve lokadarsh ke pakke samarthak the
 The impression of this support is found everywhere in his compositions
 shukla ji ke gadhy-sahitya kii bhashaa khadi boli he or uske praayah do rup milte hai - Shukla ji had complete authority over both types of language
 vah atyant sambhat, parimarjeet, praudh or vyakaran kii drushti se purna nirdosh he
 There is not even a lull in it
 shabd motiyon kii bhaanti vaakyon ke sutara main gunthe hue hai
 Not a single word is meaningless, each word has its own full significance
 shukla ji kii style par unke vyaktitv kii puri-puri chhap he
 This is why each sentence calls out that it is theirs
 saamaanya rup se shukla ji kii style atyant praudh or moulik he
 In it, Sagar is fully present in Gagar
 shukla ji kii style ke mukhyatah teen rup hai - Apart from these, other stylistic features are also found in the essays of Shukla ji, incorporation scheme, rhyme scheme, rhyming words, humor-satire, idolatry etc
 shukla ji shaayad hindi ke pehle sameekshak hai jinhone vaividhypurna jivan ke taane bane main gunfit kavy ke gahare or vyapak lakshyon kaa saakshaatkaar karne kaa vaastavik praytn kiya
 He considered 'bhava or Rasa' as the soul of poetry
 par unke vichaar se kavy kaa antim lakshya anand nahin balki vibhinn bhaavon ke parishkar, prasar or saamanjasy dwaara lokmagal kii pratishtha he
 From his point of view, great poetry is that which has exposed the activity of life
 ise unhone kavy main lokmagal kii sadhnavastha kaha he
 All the basic thinking of Shukla is committed to the tangible ideals of folk life
 'hamaare hriday kaa sidhaa lagaav prakruti ke gochar roopon se he' isliye kavi kaa sabase pehla or aavashyak kaam 'bimbgrahan' yaa 'chitranubhav' karana he
 a depiction of the 'situation' of the object is also required for complete image capture
 is prakaar shukla ji kavy dwaara jivan ke samgr bodh par bal dete hai
 He does not want any kind of monotony in life and poetry
 shukla ji kii sthapanaayen shaastrabaddh utani nahin hai jitani moulik
 He cremated poetics with his folklore and psychological point of view
 is drushti se ve acharya koti main aate hai
 The poetry of Lokmangal has the power to review Shukla ji as well as the limits
 uski shakti kavyanibaddh jivan ke vyaavhaarik or vyapak arthon ke maarmik anusandhan main nihit he
 But the predetermined moral center of his criticism also limits his literary depiction on many occasions
 His psychological vision is unique in his recognition of the poet's subjectivity
 jaaysi, sur or tulsi kii samikshaon dwaara shukla ji ne vyaavhaarik aalochana kaa ucch pratimaan prastut kiya
 In this, there is an extraordinary proof of Shukla's poetic penmanship, biography, wisdom and analyzability
 kavyagat samvednaaon kii pahchaan, unke paardarshee vishleshan or yathatathy bhashaa ke dwaara unhen pathak tak sampreshit kar dene kii unamem apurv samarthy he
 These characteristics are also evident in his reviews of the history of Hindi literature
 shukla ji ke manovikar sambandhi nibandh parinat pragna kii upaj hai
 In this, the psychological form of emotions has been explained and their need, value and importance have been determined in human life
 bhaavon ke anuroop hi manushya kaa aacharan dhalataa he- is drushti se shukla ji ne unki saamaajik arthvatta kaa manoyogpurvak anusandhan kiya
 He aggressively attacked those preaching the prohibition of psychics and insisted on the sophistication of the mentally challenged
 ye niabandh vyaavhaarik drushti se pathakon ko apane aapako or dusron ko sahi dhang se samajhane main madad dete hai tathaa unhen saamaajik daayitv or maryaada kaa bodh karaate hai
 Faith in the organization and upliftment ideals of society is the core of these works
 bhaavon ko jivan kii parichit sthitiyon se sambhddha karke kavy kii drushti se bhi unka pramanik nirupan hua he
 Shukla Ji's critical prose in its best form is transparent
 gahan vichaaron ko susangat dhang se spasht kar dene kii unamem asaamaanya kshamta he
 His prose has the brilliance of self-assured perseverance
 usamen yathatathyata or sankshiptata kaa vishisht gun paaya jaataa he
 Shukla ji's sayings are extremely economical
 unke vivechanaatmak gadhy ne hindi gadhy par vyapak prabhaav daalaa he
 Shukla Ji's 'history of Hindi Literature' is the pride of Hindi

 Shukla's poems express his patriotism through his nature-loving and careful social sentiments
 inke anuwadagranth bhashaa par inke sahaj aadhipaty ke sakshi hai
 Acharya Shukla was a writer of versatility
 jis kshetra main bhi kaary kiya usapar unhone apni amit chhap chodi
 His reputation in the field of criticism and essay is of the era

 This drama used to happen as hunters hunting sheep-goat, buffalo, deer, monkeys etc

 are famous among the youth of India today
 lekin pracheen kaal se aati hui shastreey sangeet jise uttar bharat main hindustani or dakshin bharat main karnatik sangeet kehete he aaj bhi lokapriy he
 The modern Karnataka music gathering is called Kutkari
 yah saadhaaran rup se teen ghanto tak chalata he
 And many songs are sung
 prayek karnatik geet ek raag main banaaya jaataa he
 Hence a song is sung in the same way by any singer
 har ek rachana raag evam taal main pehle se hi likh diya jaataa he joki badla nahin ja saktaa
 With the talent of the singer, the songs can be further improved to make the songs beautiful by singing separately
 kaccheri varnam yaa ek shruwati mukhade se shuru kii jaati he
 Only notes are sung in varnam
 yah darshakon ke saavdhaanee ko khinchne ke liye gaaya jaataa he
 The main sankirtana is sung after varnam
 prayek kirthan se pehle us ke raag kaa arohan kram or avarohan kram gaaya jaataa he

 In this context, 'bad Medium' can change the message to be sent, which can include changes in movements, expressions, accessories, costumes, music, etc
 kalakaar yaa koreographer samakaleen chintaaon-yah "nrity vyakt karne ke liye hai or prabhavit karne ke liye nahin karne ke liye", kaha jaataa he ki suut karne ke liye ateet kii parampara ke bich santulan banaae rakhane ke liye prayaas karata haiyah tathyaatmak rup se bharatnatyam kii praarambhik mile ke pathar sidhe "devdasiyon" ne pradarshan kiya nrity ke saath jude the ki gale laga liya gaya he

 is vikaas acchhee tarah avadharana "bharatnatyam kii kanntemporaging " ke saath ikuetatad ja saktaa he
 It has taken shape in different forms like costumes, music, accessories, presentations, etc
 to meet the demand for change, and also gained public attraction
 is madhyam se, " jugalbandi 'ke vichaar ek jhalak ke laayak he
 Jugalbandi generally refers to the association of two or more different genres in the performing arts, the famous performance artist in "maya Ravana" and "krishna", Shobhana, is a "jugalbandi" conjecture
 apane sangeet ke liye sammaan ke saath, sahaayak nishpaadan sang paaramparik live pashchimi dhadkan ke saath karnataka lay ke ek sanlayan dwaara badal diya gaya tha
 Regarding choreography, classical dance movements eliminate the colloquial style of dance, known as Jugalbandi semi-classical, various dance forms
 The styles were thus to include a combination of techniques
 ab ke rup main yah sampurna samayik bharatnatyam mata-pita nrity rup chhaayankit kiya gaya he ki had tak, yah ke mata-pita-shastreey bharatnatyam majboot karne ke liye counter hissaa banane ke liye viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 New styles of teaching Bharatanatyam thereby enriching the traditional essence of classical dance will thwart the following generations
 keemati or baadha utpann nahin kar rahe hai kanntemporaging yaa ke rup main lambey samay ke shastreey nrity ke paaramparik simaaon ke rup main ke liye kisi bhi shastreey nrity stilaging main koi buraai nahin he
 Therefore, it can be believed that Bharatanatyam, in its occasional form, will aid the classical form to survive Prime Minister Times
 vyaktigat dharna par nirbhar karata he, yah acchhee tarah se aadhyatmik, jabaki kuch anya logon ke liye, saundarya anubhavon paar or sambhawatah kuch karne ke liye apil lag saktaa he jo ek vyaktiparak ghatana vastav main he

 Michael and his girlfriend Jenna live as a couple without getting married and have a wonderful relationship that they seem to enjoy: from the very beginning of the film it is shown that Jenna is pregnant and her parents Explaining to both of them to get married
 jena yah kehti he ki micel ke kaam ke dabaav or uske chal rahe shodh kaary ke kaaran yah samay abhi shaadi karne ke liye uchit nahin he
 The real reason no one knows is that Michael feels trapped and nervous in this regard
 haalaanki vah is baat ko maanata he ki jena uske liye ek adarsh saathi he, par phir bhi micel ke man main abhi is par or vichaar karne kii ichha he
 He accidentally meets Kim during a marriage, from which he talks about this secret of their relationship
 kim ko aisa lagata he ki vah jena se apane sambandh kaa ant karne vaala he or isliye vah uske saath chhedhkhani karne lagati he
 While Michael is fascinated by Kim's zeal, immunity and passion, he does not succumb to any longing
 kim micel ko bataati he ki vah kis skool main jaati he or aamtaur par kahan ghoomane jaati he or phir donon alag ho jate hai
 Michael eventually finds Kim one day at the Memorial Union but tells him that he had come to that side to meet one of his clients
 kim yah bhaanp leti he ki vah usame dilchaspee dikhaa rahaa he or jab micel ghar waapas jate samay gaadi chalaa rahaa tha, tab vah use ek party main aane kaa nimantran detii he
 Michael accepts her
 waapas offis pahunchakar, micel samaaroh vaali raat jena ke saath nahin rah paane ke liye ek bahaanaa taiyaar kar letaa he
 He tells his friend Chris, who works with him, that if Jenna calls to find out about him, he can handle the situation with an excuse
 Chris suspects that Michael is in the affair with another girl and therefore wants to stay away from the case, as Chris too has separated from his wife shortly before; He himself has realized how painful it is to end a relationship
 micel kisi duusari ladki ke hone kii baat ko nakaar detaa he or sirf yahi kahata he ki vah 'apane college ke kisi puraane dost ke saath rahegaa'
 After the ceremony with Kim — in which Michael says he felt himself 10 years younger — the two kiss each other several times and before that Kim invites Michael to spend the night at their hostel
 haalaanki phir bhi jena ko dhokhaa dene kaa pachhtaawaa, micel kii laalasaa ke upar jeet paa letaa he or vah is baat ke liye manaa kar detaa he
 Unfortunately, Michael's father dies the same night
 kai mitra or parichit, jiname jena or kris bhi shaamil the, apni santvanaa prakat karne ke liye izi ke ghar jate hai
 There, Jenna learns that Michael had told Chris that he was going to Izzy's house, but he was not there
 jena kris se is bare main puuchhati he par kris uskaa jawaab dene se manaa kar detaa he, jisase jena kaa yah shaq or bhi batch jaataa he ki micel ab sahi raste par nahin he
 When Michael returns home that night, Jenna was ready to face him; Michel at first denies that he had gone out with Kim, but eventually confesses that he meets another girl
 haalaanki vah yah kahata he ki vah us ladki saath soya nahin tha or uskaa is tarah us ladki ke saath baahar jane kaa bhi koi vishesh matlab nahin he, phir bhi jena uske upar chillaati he or use ghar se baahar nikaal detii he
 Michael is alone, frustrated and anxious when Kim's call comes
 kim samay se pehle hi itani apeksha karne ke liye maafi maangati he or use sirf baat karne ke liye apane paas bulaati he
 Michael gets ready
 micel ke vahaan pahunchne par sheeghra hi donon ke bich shaareerik sambandh ban jate hai
 The next morning, Michael tries to go out slowly without picking Kim up, but after reaching out he remembers that he left his keys inside
 jab vah waapas andar jaataa he to kim usase puuchhati he ki vah bina usase alavida kiye hi kyun chalaa gaya tha
 Michael tells him that he left just because he did not want to wake him up and today he had to get back to his work quickly
 kim khoyi hui chaabiyaan apni jeb se nikaalati he or jab micel usase yah vaada karata he ki vah use phone karegaa tab vah chaabiyaan micel ko waapas de detii he
 After going to work, Michael plans that he will leave the office early to search for Jena
 While being told, Kim arrives at Michael's office without being asked to deliver a CD of a mixed song
 micel usase yah baat sweekaar karata he ki vah ab bhi jena se pyaar karata he, jo vastav main uske bachche kii maan banane vaali he
 He apologizes to Kim for not telling Kim about Jenna being pregnant and leaves him to find Jenna
 micel jena ke mata-pita ke ghar pahunchataa he, jena ke pita stephen use vachanabaddhata or vayaskta par ek kathor bhaashan dete hai or jena kii maafi paane ke liye use kuch salaah bhi dete hai
 Stephen begs Michael that he be always honest and never back down from his efforts
 After listening to their wise words, Michael goes to Jenna's room
 vah donon samjhauta karne hi vaale the ki tabhi, jena usase puuchhati he ki kya vah kim ke saath shaareerik sambandh na hone ke bare main sahi kah rahaa tha
 Michael said that he was telling the truth, but Stephen's advice was that he accepted Jenna that he had gone back to Kim that night
 haalaanki micel use yah vishwaas dilaataa he ki vah sirf sach bolne ke liya aisa kar rahaa he, par jena bahut naaraaz ho jaati he or gusse main us ghar se baahar nikalakar apane ghar waapas chali jaati he
 Michael also follows him and sees that Jena has locked the door from inside
 vah tay karata he ki jab tak jena usase baat karne ke liye taiyaar nahin ho jaati tab tak vah baahar ke baraamde par hi baitha rahegaa
 din-raat, dhoop or barish main bhi micel saamne ke daravaaje par baitha rahata he or kai padosiyon kaa dhyaan uski ore jaataa he or uname se kuch to usase kuch pine ke liye aagrah bhi karte hai
 Stephen sits in his car and passes by and finds Michael there, Michael also sees him
 jab stephen vahaan se aage batch rahaa hota he tab yah sochakar uske chahare par ek garvpurn muskaan aa jaati he ki micel ne uski salaah ko gambhirtha se liya
 Slowly but surely Jenna begins to soften, first she gives Michael a blanket during a cold evening, then a sandwich for him the next day
 baraamde main uski teesri raat kii purv sandhya par, jena apni chuppi todatii he or band daravaaje ke duusari taraf se micel se bolti he
 She describes her grief as saying that she is feeling sad as if she has lost her life by losing this relationship
 usee shaam ko baad main, jena daravaaza kholti he or micel andar chalaa jaataa he

 vartmaan main, vishwa main adhikansh ems kaa nirmaan jeevanuon dwaara kinvan se hota he, jo madiraa, sirka, dahi or yahan tak chocolate tak ke utpaadan ke liye apanaai janevaali vidhi se milti-julati prakriya he
 Sodium is subsequently added to the phase of neutralization
 kinvan ke dauraan, ammonia or shakarkad, ganne, tepyoka yaa shore se praapt carbohydrton ke mishran main ugaae gaye chuninda jeevanu mishran main amino acid utsarjit karte hai, jisamen se el-glutamet ko alag kar liya jaataa he
 The kyowa-hakko Kogyo Company Ltd

 aajkal, ems ke audyogic udpaadan main sharkaron se glutamet kii paidaavaar main or utpaadan dar main nirantar sudhaar ho rahaa he, jo is padaarth kii maang ko puraa karne main madad kar rahaa he
 The final products of filtering, concentrating, acidification, and clastylation are pure glutamate, sodium, and water
 yah ek safed, gandh-rahit, crystali churna ke rup main prakat hota he, jo vilyan main glutamet or sodium main viyojit ho jaataa he
 It dissolves well in water, but is not hygienic and is almost insoluble in ordinary organic solvents such as ether
 saamanytah, ems bhojan banane kii saamaanya sthitiyon main sthir rahata he
 During cooking, MSG does not decompose, but as with other amino acids, browning or Maillard reactions can occur at very high temperatures in the presence of sugars
 shuddh ems kaa apane aapmen koi priy swaad nahin hota he, yadi ise kisi sahyogi suswaadu sugandh se na milaayaa jaae
 If MSG is added in the right amount as a flavoring, it has the ability to balance other flavor-active compounds and perfect the overall flavor of some dishes
 ems maans, machhlee, murg, kai tarah kii tarkariyon, chatniyon, rason or shorabon ke saath acchhee tarah miltaa he or gomans ke rase jaise bhojanon ke sampurna swaad ko badhaata he
 But, like other basic flavors except sugars, MSG enhances the flavor of the food only when it is mixed in the right amount
 yadi ems kii maatra zarurat se zyada ho to vyanjan kaa swaad tezi se kharaab ho jaataa he
 Although the correct amount depends on the dish, the taste score in the stock begins to drop rapidly when the amount of MSG is more than 1 gram in 100 ml
 iske alaava ems or namak or newcliotide jaise anya umami padaarthon ke saath abhikriya hoti he
 They all need to be in optimal amounts for the highest taste
 in gundharmon ke kaaran ems kaa upyog namak ke antargrahan ko kam karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jo ucchraktchaap, hrid-rog or aghat ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 The taste of low-salt foods improves with MSG when the salt content is reduced by 30%
 ems main sodium kii maatra sodium chloride kii tulana main lagbhag 3 guna kam he
 Other salts of glutamate have also been used in low-salt juices, but they do not make these juices as flavorful as MSG
 bhojan ko jaayakedaar banane ke liye ems kaa upyog 100 se bhi adhik saalon se hota aa rahaa he
 Over the long term there have been detailed studies to clarify the role, benefits and safety of MSG
 aaj sthiti yah he ki bhojan yojyon se sambandhit antarrashtriya or rashtri nikaayon kaa maananaa he ki ems swaad badhaanevaale tatv ke rup main manushyon ke liye surakshit he
 The "MSG Characteristics Package" was initially named "chinese Restaurant Syndrome", when Robert Ho Man Kwok described the characteristics he felt after eating american-chinese food
 qoke ne in abhilakshanon ke liye anek kaaran bataae, jinamein shaamil the, wine ke saath pakaane kaaran elkhol, sodium kii maatra, yaa emessi kaa milaayaa janaa
 But all the attention was focused on MSG and since then these characteristics have been seen to be associated with MSG
 wine or namak kii maatra ke prabhaav par kabhi adhyayan nahin kiya gaya
 As time went by, the list of non-specific characteristics was getting longer and longer
 saamaanya paristhitiyon main, hamamen glutamet, jisamen teevr vishakta laane kii bahut kam kshamta hoti he, ko pachaane kii shakti hoti he
 The fatal dose for 50% of those taken by mouth is 15 and 18 g / kg body weight, respectively, in rats and mice, which is 5 to 5 times higher than the LD 50 of salt
 isliye, bhojan yojya ke rup main ems kaa antargrahan or bhojanon main glutamic amla kaa swaabhaavik str manushyon ke liye vishaaktata kii chintaa kaa kaaran nahin he
 a report compiled by the American Association of Experimental Biology Societies in 1995 for the Food and Drug Administration of the United States concludes that MSG is safe when eaten "up to conventional levels" and although there are healthy individuals with no food, 3 The MSG characterization package is seen on eating village MSG, the incidence of death due to MSG has not been proved because The MSG characterization package is based on written evidence
 is report se yah bhi suchit hota he ki chirsthayee yaa aksham karanevaale rogon main glutamet kii bhoomika hone kii baat ke samarthan main koi bhi data nahin he
 a controlled double-disguised multicenter clinical trial could not demonstrate a relationship between ingestion of MSG by the MSG characterization clusters and individuals who believed that they were seen to have adverse effects against MSG
 koi bhi sankhyikeey sambandh pradarshit nahin kiye ja sake or thodi si hi pratikriyaayein praapt huin or ve bhi asangat thim
 These characteristics were not observed when MSG was given with food

 In a study conducted by Tarasoff and Kelly, 71 participants who fasted were given 5 grams of MSG followed by a morning snack
 ek hi abhilakshan tha or vah bhi swa-ghoshit, esasji ke prati samvedansheel vyakti main tha jise plasibo diya ja rahaa tha
 In another study conducted by Geha and others, the response of 130 individuals who showed sensitivity to MSG was studied
 anek dibipisi pareekshan kiye gaye or kam se kam do abhilakshan vaale vyaktiyon ko hi liya gaya
 In this entire study, only 2 people reached all four challenges
 is tarah ke nimna prachlan ke kaaran, haal ke anusandhankarta is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki ems ke prati abhilakshanon ko punarpradarshit karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Other studies have considered whether MSG induces obesity and the results have been mixed
 ems or dame ke bich maujuud tathakthith sambandh par anek adhyayan hue hai; vartmaan main uplabdh pramaan aise kisi karnatmak sambandhon kii pushti nahin karte hai
 Since glutamate is an important nerve-sender in the human brain, which plays an important role in learning and memory, neuro-neurons are currently engaged in studying any potential side effects of MSG present in food, but no conclusive relationship Have not been established yet
 khaadya maanak australia newjiland ne "kai vaigyanik adhyayanon ke zabardasat pramaan" kaa ullekh karte hue, ems or "kisi gambhir vipareet prabhaav" yaa "lambey samay tak bane rahanevaale prabhaav" ke bich kisi bhi bhi prakaar ke sambandh ko spasht shabdon main nakaarte hue, ems ko "jan-saadhaaran ke liye surakshit" ghoshit kiya he
 However, he also states that in less than 1% of the population, sensitive individuals may experience "short-term" side effects, such as, "headaches, numbness / wrinkles, twitching, muscle numbness and general weakness", if they have a Ingestion of a large amount of MCG in food

 Monosodium glutamate is one of the various forms of glutamic acid found in food
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah he ki chunki glutamic amla ek amino amla he, vah prakruti main har jagah paaya jaataa he
 Glutamic acid and its salts can also be present in a variety of other compounds, including water-decomposed botanical proteins, self-decomposing yeast, water-decomposed yeast, yeast extracts, soy extracts, and dissociated proteins, known as And have to be labeled with nicknames
 1998 se, ems ko "masaalon or swadavardhakon" main shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Food additives, disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate, which are ribonucleotides, are commonly used with monosodium glutamate-containing components
 lekin, 'kudarti swaad' pad kaa upyog bhojan se sambandhit udyog main tab hota he jab glutamic amla kaa upyog kiya ja rahaa ho
 With no FDA regulation, it is not possible to find out what percentage of the 'natural flavor' is actually glutamic acid

 Michel Foucault was the leading thinker and philosopher of France
 phuko kii ginati 20 veen sadi ke sabase pramukh vichaarkon main se kii jaati hai
 It was the influence of Fuko's writings that revolutionary changes took place in many areas of modern science, and especially in the field of history writing
 rajya kii sanstha logon se kaise apni baat manawaati he— is samaj main sabase taaja or vicharottejak vikaas mishael phuko ne kiya he
 The bourgeoisie does not establish its social power in the state only through instruments of violence
 vah tarah-tarah ke saanskrithik roopon kaa istemaal karke bhi apni saamaajik satta kii nirantarata sunishchit karata he
 Therefore it is also necessary to understand the structures of the state in their cultural forms
 antatah rajya ke paksh main sahmati paidaa karne kii zimmedaari ye saanskrithik sanrachanaayen hi nibhaati hai
 Fuko explains that in order to control or discipline people in modern society, a multi-layered system of surveillance, besides assimilating the decisions made by others and the examination system, are adopted
 phuko jor dekar kehete hai ki logon par drushti rakhane maatr se satta kaa aadha kaam puraa ho jaataa he
 For this, he cites the arrangement of the stadium in which the seats are arranged in such a way that the audience can easily watch an event but at the same time this system also provides the power controllers to keep an eye on the audience
 yahan phuko anushaasan or niyantran kii satta kaa model chihnit karne ke liye raajnneetik chintak jeremi bantham dwaara kalpit jail panopticon kaa ullekh bhi karte hai
 The original Vastu-plan was such that the prisoners kept in the cells should be invisible to each other but could not be out of the prison's central tower
 kaidiyon ko kabhi is baat kaa pataa nahin chalata ki un par nigaah rakhi ja rahi he yaa nahin par unke mastishk main yah baat baith jaati he ki koi un par drushti rakhata he
 Fuco views the Panoptican doctrine as a metaphor that transcends the prison boundary and becomes a common pattern of discipline in schools, factories and hospitals
 haalaanki bantham kii yah prastaavit jail kabhi moort rup nahin le paayi lekin ek siddhant ke rup main vah aadhunik samaaj kii lagbhag har gatividhi par kabizj ho gayi he
 He has proved to be a tool for disciplining systems in modern society, which has overthrown the kings and princes of the pre-modern period and has established himself in their place
 is kram main phuko yah bhi darshaate hai ki aadhunik satta yaa anushaasan kaayam karne vaali vyavastha keval logon kii gatividhiyon par hi nazar nahin rakhti balki vah logon ko unki aakshamata dikhaakar bhi niyantrit karti he
 According to him, modern power creates categories like understanding, talent, normal and unusual behavior, and when a person does not meet the criteria or standards established by it, the system does not miss an opportunity to declare such person as inferior or abnormal
 is sandarbh main phuko yah yaad dilaanaa nahin bhoolatey ki aadhunik samaaj kii in anushaasankaree sansthaaon kaa yah ravaiya kisi tarah ke pratishodh se nahin balki sudhaar se prerit hota he
 The ultimate goal of which is that the person accepts the norms or standards provided by the society
 dhyaan den ki samaaj kii manyataon ke dwaara anushaasan kaayam karne kaa yah dhang nyaayik dand kii us vyavastha se khaasaa alag he jisamen kisi vyakti ko keval is aadhaar par dandit kiya jaataa tha ki uskaa krity kanoon sammat he yaa nahin
 In such a decision it was not said that the person is normal or abnormal
 lekin aadhunik samaaj shaikshik kaaryakramon, chikitsa ke taur-tareekon tathaa udyog va utpaadon ke maamalon main kuch nishchit maanak sthapit karne par jor detaa he or in maanakon kaa varchasv itnaa chautarfa hota he ki vyakti kaa vyavhaar or vyaktitv unheen ke hisaab se dhalane lagata he
 The state is generally seen as a governance, organization or political community
 mana jaataa he ki itihaas ke har daur main iske vividh rup maujuud rahe hai
 Changes in this have been the major subjects of history
 sirf aadim ghumantu raajnneetik samudaayon ko rajya kaa darza nahin diya jaataa he
 It is believed that in these communities, there is a lack of a definite system associated with this concept
 asal main rajya hone ke liye yah aavashyak he ki samudaay or bhu-kshetra ke bich takreeban sthai sambandh ho
 When used in this general way, the term expresses the idea that the political community has certain universal characteristics that go beyond time and space; That is, Greek polis, some common features between medieval regnums and modern republics
 kya is gun yaa visheshta ko zyaada sankuchit rup main paribhashit kiya ja saktaa he? It is clear that if a definition of the state presents it as an eternal and immutable object or organization, by doing so it ignores the process of change and development in history
 isliye ek vaid paribhaasha ko duusare pahaluon or kaaryon par dhyaan dena chahie
 History shows that the state as a universal phenomenon is an activity or organization imposed on human beings as necessities
 is tarah kii gatividhi ke rup main isaki kuch mukhya visheshtaayen is prakaar hai : yah manushyon or unki sampatti ke bich main ek nishchit sambandh banaata he; yaa duusare shabdon main yah manushyon ke bich ekta yaa samaaj kaa nirmaan karata he
 Therefore the existence of the state is uniquely a fundamental thing
 doosraa, yah manushyon ke bich vyavastha kii shakti, yaa shashan ke ek rup yaa aadesh or ajna paalan kaa ek sambandh sweekaar karata he
 Third, the activity that creates and sustains the state is unique, always presenting itself against people who are not part of this community
 baharhaal, rajya ko ek aitihaasik parighatna ke rup main dekhne ke baavjood is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki is par hone vaale lekhan main ek darshanik pahalu hameshaa shaamil rahaa he
 Under this, the question arises that what is the ideal form of the kind of arrangement or the state wants to establish relations between people? Has that ideal form been achieved? Is the present way of governance right? Are the external relations of the community being handled properly? In fact, considering this point of view, not only does the state emerge as a requirement imposed on human beings, but also as a problem of choice of 'right' in front of humans
 rajya main sirf araajaktaa kii jagah ek vyavastha sthapit karne kaa hi sangharsh nahin he
 Instead, it is also a struggle to establish a system that is genuine, authentic and just
 isliye, plato, arestu, hobbs, higel aadi ke lekhan ko is sawaal kaa darshanik uttar khojane kii koshish ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he ki rajya kaisaa hona chahie
 These scholars have tried to differentiate between the state and other types of human organizations and at the same time they have presented the hypothesis of their ideal state and the arguments in its favor
 saarvbhaum aitihaasik parighatna ke rup main rajya or ek darshanik avadharana ke rup main rajya ko dekhne ke vichaar ke saath rajya ko vishesh rup se aadhunik parighatna maanane ke vichaar ko bhi jodne kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are many historians and political theorists who argue that the term 'state' should be used to refer to the post-renaissance and Reformation system in Europe
 inkaa yah maananaa he ki rajya kaa sidghant darasal isi vishisht parighatna se judaa hua sidghant he
 Therefore, if it is used for organizations present in the second round of history, it will lead to confusion about its meaning
 ek sangathit vyavastha ke rup main rajya shabd kaa udai bhi chaudaavin sadi ke ant or satrahavin sadi ke bich hua
 The state's English word 'state' derives from the Latin word 'steer', meaning to stand
 is tarah yah ek sthiti ke bare main bataata he
 One of the main ideas behind considering the state as a modern concept is that the emergence of the modern state coincided with the concept of sovereignty
 yah ek spasht aadhunik manyata he ki jo rajya prabhusatta-sampann nahin he, vah sahi arthon main rajya hi nahin he
 Sovereignty means that the state is the supreme source of political authority in the territory under its purview
 prabhusatta ke do pahalu hai— aantarik pahalu or bahari pahalu
 The internal aspect means that there is no authority higher than the state within the boundaries of the state
 rajya sarvocch he or naagarik rajya ke kilaaf kisi anya praadhikari se apil nahin kar saktaa he
 External sovereignty means the recognition given by other states to a particular state
 saath hi, isamen yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki koi rajya antarrashtriya maamalon main apane nagarikon kii ore se bol saktaa he
 This right expresses the autonomy and sovereignty of the state in the international arena
 rajya ko ek aadhunik parighatna maanane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki ise ek aitihaasik satta yaa darshanik vichaar ke rup main bhi kaarij kar diya jaye
 It also cannot be said that no feature of the modern state was present in the earlier period of history
 asal main, aadhunik daur ke pehle ke ‘rajya’ or aadhunik daur ke saath saamne aaye ‘rajya’ kii kai visheshtaayen samaan hai
 Likewise, it cannot be said that the state as a philosophical idea represents the 'complete concept' of the modern state
 asal main darshanik rup se rajya kii avadharana alag- alag tareekon se kalpit or vivechit kii jaati rahi he
 Liberalists, for example, saw states as a 'neutral' institution, but there has been serious and varied discussion within liberalism about the role of the state
 marxvad ke bheetar bhi rajya ke lekar vaad-vivaad kii samrudgh parampara rahi he
 In this, apart from considering the state as the instrument of the capitalist classes, the debate related to 'relative autonomy of the state' has also been included
 araajaktaavaadiyon ne rajya ko ek aprakritik satta maane hue ise puri tarah khatm karne kii vakaalat kii he
 Even in the writings of marx-engels, a communist situation has been envisaged in which the state will be completely destroyed
 lekin araajaktaavaadi aisi kisi sthiti kaa intazaar karne kii bajaay rajya ko jald-se-jald khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 They believe that the state is based on violence against the natural nature of man
 duusari ore, anudaarataavaadi rajya kii tarafadaari isliye karte hai taaki vah kai pidiyon se sanchit paramparaon or mulyon kaa sangrakshan kar paye
 The state has been thought of differently in the various streams within feminists
 udhaaharan ke taur par, udaarataavaadi-nariwad yah maanata he ki ek sanstha ke rup main rajya purush varchasv kii ore jhukaa hua he, lekin kanoon banaakar rajya kii is pravriti main sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he or iskaa upyog purush-mahila samanta sthapit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, socialist-feminism considers the capitalist character of the state as the main reason for the problem of women
 isaki manyata he ki poonjeewaadi rajya khatm karne se hi striyon kii sthiti main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 Third, according to the radical feminist view, the state works to protect the family based on patriarchy and the values it promotes
 isliye pitrusatta ko puri tarah khatm karne ke liye aavashyak he ki rajya ko bhi khatm kiya jaae
 Clearly, there is much varied and intense debate about the state, its nature and role
 haal ke daur main europee union jaisi sanrachanaon ke ubhaar ke kaaran yah tark diya gaya he ki rajya dhire-dhire apraasangik ho rahaa he
 But this argument is not very strong
 yah sach he ki europee union main shaamil deshon ne ek majboot kshetreey sanghathan ko banane ke liye apni sahmati di he
 Nevertheless, they do not want to end their identity as a nation-state
 duusare kai kshetreey sanghathanon ne bhi kshetra ke deshon ke bich sahyog badhaayaa he, lekin is baat kii koi sambhaavna nazar nahin aati he ki ve raashtra-rajya kaa vikalp sabit honge
 In the contemporary world, the state is a reality that has no chance of ending
 vaicharik rup se iskaa virodh karne vaale kai vichaardhaaraon ke anuyaayi vyaavhaarik mauka milane par bhi rajya kii sanstha ko khatm kar paane main naakaam rahe hai

 In normal arithmetic this expression is meaningless because there is no number that is multiplied by 0 to get a
 atah shunya se bhaajan aparibhaashit he
 Since any number multiplied by zero gives the result zero, therefore 0 / 0 also has no fixed value
