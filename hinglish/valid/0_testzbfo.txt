 pashuprajnan ke vyapak arth ke antargat pashuon ke utpaadan, unke paalanposhan tathaa dekhbhaal sambandhi sabhi prakaar ke kaary aate hai, kintu simit arth main is shabd kaa prayog praaia: pashuon kii anuvanshikta main aise sudhaar karne se he jisase manushya kii aavashyaktaa tathaa icchaanukool unnat prakaar ke pashu uplabdh ho saken
 Animals can be improved in two ways: pratham unke vaataavaran main sudhaar karne se tathaa doosraa unki anuvanshikta main sudhaar karne se
 Improving either of these two cannot lead to proper progress
 vaataavaran main sudhaar karne se pashusankhya main parivartan praaia: bahut sheeghra hota he, kintu vah parivartan sthaayee nahin hota or tabhi tak rahata he jab tak nai paristhiti bani rahati he
 But by improving the genetics of an animal community, the change is usually slow, but it is permanent
 prarambh main pashuprajnak pashuon ke aise samooh ko, jinhen ve anya pashuon se shreshth samajhate the, alag kar lete the
 Then they used to choose the best ones in them
 is prakaar ke chayan se samooh main kuch aise bhi pashu nikal aate the jinamein pashuprajnan ke manovanchit kun vidyaman hote the
 Now the animals which they liked to breed were chosen as the father of the second generation and this method was adopted from generation to generation
 pashupaalak is bhanti avaanchit tatwon ko nikaalata jaataa or vaanchit gunonvale pashuon kii vruddhi par jor detaa jaataa tha
 Three things are required under any animal breeding program: kisi bhi prajnan-kaarykram ke antargat pehla kadam yah nirdhaarit karnaa hota he ki prajnak kaa lakshya kya he kya vah bazaar main bechney ke liye pashuon ke utpaadan main vruddhi karnaa chahta he, athwa vanaspatik sadhano ko pashutpadit vastuon main badalanaa chahta he, athwa kisi vishesh jalwaayu ke anukool pashu taiyaar karnaa chahta he ityadi
 It may be beneficial to follow two different types of animals of the same race for two different purposes in the same farm, some for horse-drawn carriage, some for riding, some animals for meat production, some for rearing For milk production
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki ek hi prakaar ke pashu main vibhinn gunon kaa sammishran ho, jisase ek hi pashu se do vibhinn aavashyaktaaon kii purti ho sake
 Assessing the qualities of each animal is the second step under the breeding program
 varan prajnan kaarykram ke antargat teesraa kadam he, jisamen is baat kaa aganan kiya jaataa he ki uplabdh jaanwaron main se prayek main kis had tak vaanchit gunon ko utpann karne tathaa unke upyog karne, yaa tyaagane, kii anuvanshikta vidyaman he
 Separating animals according to these qualities is called selection or selection
 varan teen prakaar kaa hota hai : Selecting animals for breeding solely on the basis of their individual traits
 Group selection, selection of them based on the traits of ancestors and endowments, and evaluating the reproductive qualities of an animal based on the quality of lineage and total selection and progeny is called progeny test
 is
 yadi in teenon prakaar ke varanon kii aapas main tulana karen, to inamen se prayek ke apane apane gundosh hai
 When certain inherited traits are very hereditary, then these symptoms appear in the average child just like the mother, but the symptoms when they are less hereditary are smaller in the average child than the family from which the parents were selected
 Properties will appear in samooh varan dwaara unnati varan kii tivrata or janak ke kul ke ausat hraas par nirbhar karti he
 The group makes the first more obvious change in the animal, but later the speed slows down and the effect is not great
 "samooh varan" dwaara jitna lakshya praapt kiya ja saktaa he utana parivaar varan dwaara nahin, kintu isse duusari peedi kii santan main janak kii ausat vilakshantaa se, neeche hraas nahin hota
 Family selection, especially for traits that are genetic in small amounts, or that cannot be determined separately in individual animals, or that are sometimes found in females or in males, or for determination of longevity when Till a creature is not particularly mature or old, it is not clear that it is useful
 sahi parivaar varan ke liye Number of families is large parivaar ke sadasyon main bilkul nikat kaa sambadh ho or Each of the families to be compared must have grown up in the same situation and environment
 ghodon,bakrii ,bhedon tathaa anya maweshiyon main, jinamein ek hi maan baap se utpann santati bahut kam hoti hai, parivaar varan adhik mahatv kaa nahin hota
 When the animal remains a child, only then its qualities have to be seen and then the child's selection is beneficial
 kintu bachche nimna koti kii anuvanshikta ke hote hai, athwa inamen kisi ek hi ling kii visheshta hoti he
 The following points are necessary for the correct child test: isamen sabhi santaanen, yaa kam se kam jin chune gaye namoonay bhi, samavisht kiye jaayen, Secondly, the qualities which the children have acquired from the parents, should be passed on to them, or they should be evaluated with proper accuracy and jinaki tulana kii ja rahi ho, ve sabhi santati ek hi prakaar ke vaataavaran main pali hon
 For detailed article, see - Artificial semen nar kaa shukr lekar bina prakritik sambhog ke maadaa kii yoni yaa garbhashay main sthapit karne kaa kaary bahut varshon se prayogshaalaon main, visheshat: ashvaprajnan main, napunsakata kaa saamana karne ke liye hota rahaa he
 But its extensive use on other farm animals was first developed by Russian activists in the early 20th century, in other countries it was also adopted, especially for dairy cattle
 kritrim viryasechan ke liye nar ko kisi kathputli maadaa ke saath maithun karakar, yaa nar ke ling kaa gharshan kar, veery ko skhlit karakar ikattha kar liya jaataa he
 Now the semen is mixed with the appropriate solution and egg yolks and diluted, so that many females can be conceived with only one time of ejaculated semen
 is tanukrut veery ko nimna taap par rakhkar anek dinon tak garbhashay ke yogya rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The offspring produced by artificial uterus are similar to those produced by natural intercourse
 kritrim viryasechan se prayek pashupaalan ko saand rakhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or is prakaar vah saand rakhane kii kathinaayee or kharche se batch jaataa he
 The cost of artificial insemination may be more or less than that of natural conception
 kritrim viryasechan karaane kaa kaary ek aise prashikshit vyakti dwaara, jo ki prajnan kii trutiyon ko pahachaanata or unka upachaar karata ho, kiya jaataa he
 This leads to good reproductive health
 kritrim viryasechan kaa vyay kam pade, iske liye pashupalkon kaa kritrim viryasechan sansthaaon ke saath sahyog karnaa aavashyak he
 After choosing the special males and females to become parents, the second step is to decide which female to associate with which female
 yadi pashupaalak kii koi nishchit niti nahin he, to janak or janani bananevaale puure samooh ke antargat hi kisi maadaa ke saath kisi bhi nar kaa sangam karaayaa jaataa he
 If the pair is selected on the basis of their mutual relationship, then the pairing may range from inbreeding to the possible mate breeding of the entire group of parents
 sangam kii ye paddatiyaan milaai ja sakati hai, yaa unamem her pher kiya ja saktaa he or chayan ke vibhinn tareekon ke saath vyavhaar main laayaa ja saktaa he
 In this way many types of breeding schemes can be made possible
 sangam kii paddatiyaan swayan kisi pitru jin ko bahush: ghatman yaa adhik viral nahin banaati, kintu ye pitru jin ke vibhinn sanyojanon ke anupaat main avashya hi parivartan laa detii hai or jansankhya kii parivartita ko badal de sakati he, jisase chayan yadi sangam kii aniyamit vidhi se hota he, to adhik prabhavakaari ho saktaa he
 Sangam in close relatives is called inbreeding
 is paribhaashik shabd kaa prayog unke liye kiya jaataa he jinamein yugma ke nar or nari kaa paraspar sambadh kam se kam chachere yaa mausere kaa ho
 Proximal inbreeding results in clear and rapid
 madhyam ant:prajnan anek pidiyon tak kiya jaae to prabhavakaari ho saktaa he
 The major effect of inbreeding is to increase homozygosity and to divide the breed into clear and unrelated families
 ant:prajnan jyon jyon aage badhata chalata he prayek parivaar apane hi antargat adhik samayugmak or anya pariwaron se bhinn ho jaataa he
 This increases the probability of effective selection among families
 samayugmajata main vruddhi adhik vyashtiyon main uttarottar gunon ko utpann karti he
 Since the ineffective property is often much less preferred than the effective, it usually results in some average degradation of the individual's properties, as it exposes undesired ineffective properties
 jab ant: kintu asambadhit vyashtiyon kaa sankaran karaayaa jaataa he tab mul pashudhan kii apeksha santan main praaia: adhik jeevanshkti pradarshit hoti he
 In this way, there is usually an immediate loss from inbreeding, but in the course of time, the intergenerational lineage chosen is mutually interchanged, then there is a benefit
 kisi spishiz kii kinhin vishesh trutiyon ko dur karne yaa varnsankarta ke oj or kisi vaanchit gunon kaa samavesh karaane ke liye aise jode chune jate hai jinamein yathasambhav aapas main kisi prakaar kaa sambadh na rahaa ho
 The offspring resulting from the heterogeneity of different breeds, or different species of the same species, often exhibit exceptional growth and high vitality
 jab is pratham peedi ke varnsankaron kaa paraspar prajnan karaayaa jaataa he, tab varnsankarta ke oj kaa praaia: hraas ho jaataa he
 The best example of outbreeding is mule

 For a sphere, the minimum mass of a pressure vessel is where: Other shapes besides a sphere have constants larger than 3 / 2, although some tanks, such as non-spherical wound composite tanks can approach this
 This is sometimes called a "bullet" for its shape, although in geometric terms it is a capsule
 For a cylinder with hemispherical ends, where In a vessel with an aspect ratio of middle cylinder width to radius of 2: 1, Stress in a shallow-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a sphere is where σ θ { \ displaystyle \ sigma _ { \ theta}} is hoop stress, or stress in the circumferential direction, σ long { \ displaystyle \ sigma _ {long}} is stress in the longitudinal direction, p is internal gauge pressure, r is the inner radius of the sphere, and t is thickness of the sphere wall
 a vessel can be considered "shallow-walled" if the diameter is at least 10 times greater than the wall depth
 Stress in a shallow-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a cylinder is where: Almost all pressure vessel design standards contain variations of these two formulas with additional empirical terms to account for wall thickness tolerances, quality control of welds and in-service corrosion allowances
 For example, the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code formulas are: Spherical shells: Cylindrical shells: where e is the joint efficient, and all others variables as stated above
 The factor of safety is often included in these formulas as well, in the case of the ASME BPVC this term is included in the material stress value when solving for pressure or thicknes

 Uttara Mimamsa is also known as 'physical epistemology' and 'vedantadarshan'
 ye naam baadaraayan ke banaae hue brahmasutra naamak granth ke hai
 The word epistemology means research, serious, thought, discovery
 pracheen bharat main vedon ko param pramaan mana jaataa tha
 Veda Vamay is very detailed and contains mantras related to Yajna, worship and knowledge
 ve mantra, brahman or aaranyak-upanishad naamak bhaagon main vibhajit kiye gaye hai
 Being very ancient, the knowledge of Vedavakas meaning, experimentation and interrelationship was lost, and there was a need to research them
 mantra or brahman bhaagon ke antargat vaakyon kaa samanvay jaimini ne apane granth mimasaasutra main kiya
 Mantamsa, being a precursor to the Mantra and the Brahmana Veda, got its name and meaning of usage
 veda ke uttar bhaag aaranyak or upanishad ke vaakyon kaa samanvay baadaraayan ne brahmasutra naamak granthon main kiya atev uskaa naam uttarmimasaa padaa
 Uttara Mimamsa is also called bodily epistemology because it signifies the means and worships for the bodily soul through which he can experience his brahmastha
 iskaa naam vedant darshan is kaaran padaa ki isamen veda ke antim bhaag ke vaakyon ke vishyon kaa samanvay kiya gaya he
 It got its name Brahmamimamsa or Brahmasutra because the particular subject in it is Brahman and the metaphysics of its form, while the subject of Purvimamsa is Yajna and religious acts

 kalantar main unka puraa gyaan lupt ho gaya or unke upar bhashya likhane kii aavashyaktaa padi

 shankar ke pashchaat or aacharyon ne bhi apane-apane sampradaay ke maton kii pushti karne ke liye or apane maton ke anuroop brahmasutra par bhashya likhe
 The commentaries of Sri Ramanujacharya, Sri Madhvacharya, Sri Nimbarkacharya and Sri Vallabhacharya are noted
 in sab aacharyon ke mat, kuch anshon main samaan hote hue bhi, bahut kuch bhinn hai

 is samasya ke saath yah samasya bhi sambhddha he ki jin upanishadvakyon kaa brahmasutra main samanvay karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he unke darshanik vichaar kya hai
 What did Badarayana think of him and what did the commentators think of him? The same commentary should be understood to be mostly correct which suits both the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 is drushti se shri shankaracharya kaa mat adhik samichin jaan padataa he
 Some scholars describe the opinion of Ramanujacharya as more favorable
 uttarmimasaa kaa sabase vishesh darshanik siddhant yah he ki jad jagat

 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts

 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion

 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent
 sankshep main, hindutv ke pramukh tatva nimnlikhit hai-hindu-dharm hindu-koun?-- goshu bhakthirbhavedyasya pranave c drudha matih
 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
