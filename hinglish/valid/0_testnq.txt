 stan chithran kaa lakshya stan cancer kaa shuruuaati daur main hi pataa lagaana he or yah saamanyat: kuch khaas tarah ke punjon or / yaa choti koshikaon kaa pataa lagaakar kiya jaataa he
 Mammography is believed to reduce mortality from breast cancer
 kam jokhim vaali kisi anya chithran takanic vikaas ab tak nahin hua he, lekin stan aatm pariksha or chikitsak ke pareekshan ko stan kii niyamit dekhbhaal ke aavashyak hisse maane gayi hai
 Many countries are encouraged to adopt routine mammography as a screening method for older women for early detection of breast cancer
 sanyukt rajya america priventive services task force 50 se 74 aayu varg kii mahilaon ke liye har 2 saal par naidanik stan pareekshan ke saath yaa iske bina mammography screening kii sifarish karata he
 Overall it has been found that clinical trials showed a relatively low 20% mortality rate from breast cancer, but the two highest-quality trials did not show a decrease in mortality
 In 2000, breast images became controversial after a newspaper published the results and published the results of two studies of the highest quality
 anya sabhi eks-re kii tarah stan chitra main chitra banane ke liye vikiran ko ynit karne kii khuraaq kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The radiologist then analyzes all abnormal findings

 At this time, mammography is also preferred with physical breast testing for early breast cancer disease studies
 Ultrasound, ductography, positron emission mammography and magnetic resonance imaging are complementary to mammography
 saamanyat: ultrasound kaa upyog mammography se praapt yaa is prakriya se nahin chune yogya punjon ke aage ke moolyankan ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Some institutions still use ductograms for leakage of blood from the nipple or nipple, if the disease is not detected by breast imagery

 During the procedure, the breast is compressed through a dedicated mammography unit

 Due to those plates the required radiation volume can be reduced and the breast is kept stable

5 percent it will not be found
 Of the 3

 Mammogram results are often placed in the by-raids assessment category, also known as the "by-raids Score"
 ye shreniyan 0 se 6 shrenee ke bich hoti hai
 Mammograms in Britain are measured on a scale between 1–5
 haalanki stan cancer kii screening ke liye mammography ekmaatr tarika he, jisase jaan bachaai ja sakati he, par yah ekadam sateek nahin he
 The number of cancer patients who have escaped detection by mammography is typically 10% to 30%
 iskaa matlab yah he ki prati 1 xxrep 5 0 mahilaon main se jin 350 mahilaon main stan cancer paaya jaataa he, unamem se kareeb 35 se 105 main mammography dwaara cancer kaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa
 cancer kaa pataa nahin lag paane ke kaarnon main paryvekshak kii chook shaamil he, lekin ekaadhik baar aisa hota he ki stan cancer stan ke duusare ghaney utakon main chhip jaataa he or mammogram kii purvyaapee samiksha ke baad bhi nahin dikh paata
 iske alaava, stan cancer ke ek rup lobular cancer ke viksit hone tarika aisa he, jo mammogram par apni chaaya daal detaa he or jisase unhen stan ke saamaanya utakon se pruthak karnaa sambhav nahin hota
 Computer-assisted diagnosis is being tested to reduce the number of cancer patients missed by mammograms
 ek pareekshan main computer ne 71% maamalon kii pahchaan kii, jinka pataa lagane main chikitsak chuk gayi the
 However, computers attracted attention twice as much to cancerous components as compared to physicians
 mammogram ke ek bade set ke ek duusare adhyayan main, ek computer ne chah biopsy kii sifarish kii, jabaki chikitsakon ne aisa nahin kiya tha
 All these six cases were found to be cancerous, which would have been ignored
 In general, the specificity of CAD systems in screening of mammography is quite low and comparatively low reading capability is also lacking, although computer-aided detection effects induce the sensitivity and specificity of screening for mammography
 swasthya praudyogiki akalan, 9 )
 Such data is increasing, which suggests that CAD can detect cancer in some additional areas and it should be kept in this perspective
 The rate of additional detection was 20%, thus CAD could help detect cancer out of an additional 8 out of 10,000 women groups, with 40 having cancer
 cancer ke ye atirikt prakaar praarambhik avasthaa vaale or chote ho sakate hai
 There was no such data until 2006, which showed that after detecting these additional cancer patients, their survival rate was affected
 Some believe that this type of cancer is likely to be detected in the next screening itself, is still at diagnostics level and therefore it remains to be proven that CAD will eventually have any effect on the patient's outcome
 1 oktober 2008 ko british shodhakartaaon dwaara jari adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki ek chikitsak dwaara ek baar padhane ke sangyojan ke rup main siedi kaa upyog ek chikitsak dwaara do baar padhane jitna laabhadaayak ho saktaa he
 The study of 31000 women, the largest study ever, showed that one physician had a nearly identical disease detection rate with CAD compared to two physicians

 These patients are referred for further usually higher intensity testing

 is ucch samvedansheeltaa kaa parinaam apekshaakrit badi sankhya main aaye parinaamon ke rup main hota he, jisase rog ke bina rogi sandigdh ke rup main mana jaataa he
 This is true of mammography
 ek jaanch satr ke baad rogiyon ko ek aage ke pareekshan ke liye waapas bulaayaa jaataa he to kabhi-kabhi ise "galat sakaaratmak" or ek trutipurna sanket kaha jaataa he
 In fact, it is necessary to call many healthy patients for further investigation, so that cancer patients can be detected as much as possible
 shodh se pataa chalata ki galat sakaaratmak stan chitra mahilaon kii khushhaali or vyavhaar ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Some women with false positive results may return for more routine screening and may have increased rates of breast self-examination
 haalanki, galat sakaaratmak parinaam praapt karne vaali kuch mahilaon ko stan cancer hone kii ashanka ke bare main chintaa, pareshaani or dukh ho saktaa he or aisa bhav kai varshon tak rah saktaa he
 At the same time, there may be a missed or "false negative" rate in tumor detection in the breast image
 nakaaratmak khoj ke aankadon kaa pataa lagaana saadhaarant: isliye mushkil he kyonki us har mahila kaa mastectomies nahin hota he, jinke paas sahi-sahi galat nakaaratmak dar vaali mammography he
 Inaccurate negative rate estimates rely on further intensive investigation of a large number of patients for many years
 yah vyavhaar main kaaphi kathin he, kyonki kai mahilaayein niyamit rup se mammography ke liye waapas nahin aatin, jisase yah pataa lagaana mushkil ho jaataa he ki unhen cancer hua tha yaa nahin
 dow shamooel es ipstin ne apni pustak da politics of cancer main ne daawa kiya he ki 40 se 49 varsh kii mahilaon main prayek mammography main chaar main se ek mahila main cancer kaa pataa lagane main chook hui
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki yuva mahilaon main stan utak kaaphi ghaney hote hai or ganth kaa pataa lagaana mushkil hota he
 For this reason, inaccurate negative reports in breast imagery done before menopause can occur up to two times
 yahi kaaran he ki britain main screening kaarykram main 50 varsh kii umr tak mahilaon ko screening kaarykram ke liye mahilaon ko bulaanaa nahin shuru kiya jaataa
 The importance of omissions in the discovery of cancer is unclear, especially if the woman gets breastmilk every year
 sambandhit sthiti par kiye gayi anusandhan se pataa chalata he ki chote cancer, jinpar bhale hi turant nidanmoolak kaam nahin shuru kiya gaya, lekin kai varshon kii avadhi tak nigaraanee rakhi gai, unke achche parinaam dikhe
 3184 mahilaon ke ek samooh kaa mammogram kiya gaya, jinhen aupchaarik rup se "sambhavit rup se shuruuaati" ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya tha
 This classification of patients is clearly not common, but it does include some areas of minor concern
 in parinaamon main rogayon kii biopsy nahin kii gai, par teen saal ke liye har chah maheene par mammography ke nateezon par najar rakhi gai, taaki koi parivartan nahin hone guarantee pai ja sake
 in 3184 mahilaon main se 17 ko cancer tha
 Most importantly, they were still in the early stages of 0 or 1 when they were detected
 paanch saal ke upachaar ke baad in 17 mahilaon main se kisi main punrariti ke saboot nahin the
 Thus, early-stage small cancers, although not diagnosed immediately, are still fully curable
 
 Radiation side effects associated with mammography are a potential risk of screening
 is kuprabhav kaa khatra sabase adhik navayuvatiyon ko hota he
 The largest study on radiation side effects from mammography concluded that radiation-induced breast cancer was modest for women 40 years of age or older, particularly with a benefit-to-risk ratio compared to the potential benefit of mammographic screening 48
5 people were rescued compared to one, who died due to the ill effects of radiation
 Organizations such as the National Cancer Institute and the United States Preventive Task Force take such risks into account when formulating screening guidelines
 bahusankhyak swasthya visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki 35 se kam umr kii kam jokhim vaali mahilaon ke liye stan cancer kaa khatra itnaa zyada nahin he ki unhen vikiran ke sambhavit kuprabhav kaa khatra uthaanaa pade
 is kaaran se or 35 se kam umr kii mahilaon main stan kii vikiran samvedansheeltaa sambhawatah zyada umr kii mahilaon kii tulana main adhik he, isliye zyaadaatar radiologist 40 se kam umr kii mahilaon kii mammography nahin karte
 haalanki, agar kisi vishesh rogi main cancer kaa mahatvapurn jokhim he, to mammography phir bhi mahatvapurn ho sakati he
 Often, radiologists try to avoid mammography by using ultrasound or MRI imaging
 mammography or 40 se 55 ke bich umr kii mahilaon ke bare main aankade sabase vivaadaaspad rahe hai
 The Canadian National Breast Cancer Study in 1992 showed that mammography did not have a positive effect on the mortality of women aged 50 to 60
 yah adhyayan haalanki, sirf yah parinaam hasil karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Critics of the study said that it had very serious flaws, which proved these results to be wrong
 is baat ke bhi saboot hai, jinase spasht rup se pataa chalata he ki mahilaon kii jaanch ke dauraan cancer kii pahchaan ke liye jarurat se zyada kavayad kii gai
 Such cancers never affect these women throughout their lifetime
 When 2000 women underwent a 10-year diagnostic procedure, 10 of them underwent an excessive diagnostic procedure to diagnose breast cancer and underwent unnecessary therapy to save lives
 haalanki 40 or 50 ke bich kii mahilaon kii screening ab bhi vivaadaaspad he, sabooton kii sankhya sanket karti he ki rog ke shuru main hi pataa lagane sandarbh main iske thode laabh hai
 Currently, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology encourage women between the ages of 40 and 49 to undergo mammography every 2 years
 iske vipareet, chikitsakon ke ek bade samooh american college of physician ne haal hi main 40 se 49 varsh kii umr kii mahilaon ko thok bhav se har do saal par screening karaane ke vipareet vyaktigat screening yojanaon ko protsaahit kiya he
 Recently, the US Preventive Service Task Force stated that it is not necessary to conduct regular check-ups for women between 40 and 50 years old
 unki report main kaha gaya he ki 50 saal kii umr se pehle jaanch ke laabh jokhim se zyada ahm nahin hai
 The use of mammography as a tool for screening for early detection of breast cancer continues to be debated
 aalochakon kaa kahana he cancer kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek badi sankhya main mahilaon kii jaanch kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Coppons reminds us that breast cancer death rates have dropped by 30% since 1990, and studies in Sweden and the Netherlands show that mammography screenings have reduced cancer deaths by two-thirds
 is

" " unke vishleshan ke anusaar 2000 mahilaon main ek kaa jivan screening ke kaaran 10 varsh lanbaa hoga, tathaapi anya 10 swasth mahilaayein anaavashyak rup se stan cancer ke ilaaj se guzrengi
 neuman bataate hai ki mammography kii screening kul milakar mrityu dar kam nahin karti, lekin cancer kaa dar paidaa kar ullekhneey nuksaan or anaavashyak shalya hastkshepon kaa kaa kaaran banati hai
 Finally, a recent critical article suggests that a successful screening program should result in an increase in the number of early cases of breast cancer and a decrease in the number of later stage cancers
 However this is not happening with ongoing mammography screening
 haalanki mammography kaa kharch apekshaakrit kam he, isaki samvedansheeltaa adarsh nahin he
 There are reports that it ranges from 45 percent to about 90 percent depending on factors such as breast density

 Earth's gravitational force exerted on the unit mass of a body near the surface of the Earth is called Earth's gravity
 ise g ke rup main nirupit kiya jaataa he
 If a body is moving freely near the surface of the earth in the absence of any force other than gravitational force, its acceleration will be equal to g
 iskaa maan lagbhag 9

 The value of g varies at different places on the earth
 g ko twaran kii bhaatin bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 If a body is lifted up from the earth and does not act any other force on it, it falls directly towards the earth and its velocity increases in a fixed order
 is prakaar prithvi ke aakarshan bal ke kaaran kisi pind main utpann hone vaali vegavruddhi yaa twaran ko gurutvajanit twaran kehete hai
 It is expressed by the English letter g
 upar kaha ja chukaa he ki ise kisi sthaan par gurutv kii tivrata bhi kehete hai
 Gravitational acceleration, that is, the value of g decreases with distance from the center of the Earth, that is, it decreases as this distance increases and increases as the distance decreases
 isliye samudratal par iskaa maan adhik tathaa pahaado par kam hota he
 Similarly, its value at the equator is less than that of the poles, because the earth is somewhat clogged at the poles due to which the distance of the poles from the center of the earth is less than that of the equator

 g kaa maan gyaat karne kii vidhiyon ko do kotiyon main vibhakt kar sakate hai: Direct method and dolak vidhi
 In this method a body is dropped from a certain height and the distances it crosses over the same period are measured
 isse g ke maan kii gananaa kii jaati he
 This method is used in Atwood's machine
 isamen do sanhatiyaan m1 or m2 jinamein paraspar atyant sookshm antar hota he, ek taage dwaara judi hoti hai jo ek ghirani par se hokar guzarati he
 If m2 is relatively heavy, it will start to descend and m1 will climb up
 yadi s duuri par kar chukne par uskaa veg v ho jaae or twaran f ho to newton ke gatinium ke anusaar v ^ 2 = 2 fs twaran f kaa maan nimnlikhit sutara dwaara gyaat kiya ja saktaa he: f = m1 + m2 gr ^ 2 / r ^ 2) yahan i centre ke chaaro ore ghirani kaa avasthitatv ghurna he tathaa r ghirani kaa ardhavyas he
 Therefore, no consideration is given to the friction of the pulley and resistance to air etc
 in this method, so there is a substantial error in the value of g obtained by it
 in kaarnon se is vidhi kaa anusaran saamanyat: nahin kiya jaataa he
 In this method, a pendulum is oscillated on both sides of its mean position and the periodic t is determined
 yadi nilamban bindu se lekar lolak ke gurutvakentre tak kii duuri l ho or yah maan liya jaay ki lolak kaa sampurna bhaar uske gurutvakentre par hi sanghanit ho to dolankaal t or gurutv kii twrita g par paraspar nimnlikhit sutara dwaara sambandhit hote hai: t = 2 p ÖI / g yaa, g = 4p 2 i / T2 In this method, care is taken that the oscillator's expansion or amplitude does not exceed 40, otherwise the formula will have to be modified as follows: t = 2 Ö1 / g Here q is the dimension
 g kaa adhik sateek maan gyaat karne ke liye ek drudh pind ko lolak ke rup main liya jaataa he jo kshaitiz kshurdhar par dolan karata he
 If the distance of the alkaloid from the center of gravity is i and k is the radius of radius going through its center of gravity and around the parallel axis of the alkali, then the formula g = 4 p 2 / IT^2 The value of g can be found more precisely
 aise lolak ko yogic lolak kaha jaataa he
 If the text of periodic t is taken for different values of i in the compound pendulum and an graph is obtained between i and T, the length of the value increases as the length of the pendulum increases, oscillation decreases, but It starts to rise again after reaching the minimum value
 lolak ke madhyabindu ke nikat pahanchane par dolankaal badi drut gati se anant maan kii ore agrasar hota he
 To find a more accurate value of g, Ketter took a pendulum that was in the form of a rod and had a base on either side of its midpoint
 donon kshurdhaaron se latakaae jane par laalak kaa aavartkaal ek hi aata tha
 Two metal blocks with uneven code were also installed in this rod
 ek kii sanhati duusare se kaaphi adhik thi
 The periodicity of the pendulum on both the bases could be made roughly the same by adjusting the heavier codes, and the difference between the two frequencies could be reduced further by adjusting the heavier codes
 yadi T1or T2 kramash: donon kshurdhaaron se dolan karaane par aavartkaal hon or I1 tathaa I2 un kshurdhaaron kii chad ke gurutvakentre se dooriyaan hon to besel ke anusaar 4 p 2 / g = T12 + T22 / I1 + I2 + T12-T22 / I1-I2 isamen I1 + I2 ko thik thik napa ja saktaa he or antim pad atyant sookshm hone ke kaaran tyajya he
 Therefore, this formula can give the exact value of g

 Hastrekha Shastra or chiramancy is composed of "hand" and mantia) is an art of describing the symptoms and predicting the future by reading the palm which is also called palmistry study or palmistry
 is kala kaa prayog kai saanskrithik vividhtaon ke saath duniya bhar main dekha jaataa he
 Those who read palmistry are also commonly called palmists, palm readers, hand readers, palm analysts, or palm readers
 hastrekha shaastra ko aam taur par chhadam vigyaan mana jaataa he
 The information outlined below is in essence the main elements of modern palmistry, many of which explain the various lines often contradicting them and palmists are divided into various "schools"
 hastrekha shaastra kii jaden chini vijing,bharat main jyotish shaastra or roma bhavishyavetta se judi hui hai
 The Hindu sage Valmiki is believed to have written a book, the English translation of which would be titled "the Teachings of Valmiki Maharishi on Mail Palmistry" and contains 567 verses
 bharat se, hastrekha kala kaa china, tibet, misr, faras or europe ke anya deshon main prasar hua
 From China, palmistry spread to Greece, where Anaxagoras used it
 lekin, aadhunik hastrekha shastri aksar bhavishya karne vaali paaramparik takanic ko manovigyaan, sampurna nidaan, anumaan ke vaikalpik tareekon se bhi jodate rahe hai
 In palmistry, "reading" the palm of a person evaluates his character or future life
 vibhinn "linon" or "uthaan" yaa, ko padhakar anumaanath: unke sambhddha aakaar, gun or antarshakhaon ke sambandh main suzav diye jate hai
 In some customs, palm readers read fingers, fingernails, fingerprints and lines of a person's skin, skin texture and color, shape, palm shape and hand flexibility
 ek hastrekhavid aamtaur par vyakti ke 'pramukh haath' 
 hastrekha vigyaan kii kuch paramparaon main duusare haath ko vanshanugat yaa parivaar ke lakshanon ko dhaaran kiya hua yaa hastrekhavid ke brahmand sambandhi vishwaason par aadhaarit mana jaataa he, jisase ateet ke jivan yaa purv janm kii sharton ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 The roots of the basic framework for "classical" palmistry are rooted in Greek mythology
 hatheli or ungaliyon kaa prayek kshetra ek devi yaa devtaa se sambandhit he or us kshetra kii visheshtaayen vishay ke isi pahalu kii prakruti kaa sanket he
 For example, the ring finger Apollo is associated with the Greek god; The features of this ring finger are seen during the discussion of the subjects related to art, music, aesthetics, fame, money and harmony
 yadhyapi is baat par bahes hoti rahi he ki koun sa haath padhanaa behatar he, par donon kaa apana mahatv he
 It is customary to assume that the left hand represents the person's possibilities and the right is a display of right personality
 kuch kaa kahana he ki mahatv is baat kaa he ki koun sa haath dekha jaataa he
 "the future is seen with the right hand and the past with the left
 " "baayan haath bataata he ki ham kya-kya lekar paidaa hue hai or dahinaa dikhaata he ki hamane ise kya banaaya he
 "" The right hand is read by men, while the left hand of women is read
 " "baanyaa haath bataata he ki ishwar ne aapako kya diya he or daayan bataata he ki aapako is sambandh main kya karnaa he
 " lekin in sab kehane kii baaten hai, vritti or anubhav hi aapako behatar dhang se bataayegaa ki aakhir main koun sa haath padhanaa thik rahegaa
 Depending on the palmistry and type of reading them, palmists can see palm shape and finger lines, skin color and texture, fingernail texture, proportional shape of palm and fingers, prominence of knuckles and many other features of the hand
 hastrekha shaastra kii adhikansh dhaaraon main haath kii akritiyon ko 4 yaa 10 pramukh shastreey prakaaron main vibhajit kiya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi iske liye shastreey tatwon yaa visheshtaon kaa sahaara bhi liya jaataa he
 Character size of the indicated type of character haalanki bhinn-bhinn roopon ke baavjood sabase aam vargeekaran hi aadhunik hastrekhavid prayog karte hai
 It is easy to determine the dominating elements and nature in your own palm, the number of lines and the quality of the rows can also be included in the analysis of the shape of the hand
 hastrekha shaastra kii kuch paramparaon main, prithvi or jal haathon main kam or gahari rekhaaen hoti hai, jabaki vaayu or agni haath main or adhik rekhaaen dikh sakati hai, jinamein kam spasht paribhaasha hoti he
 Three lines are found in almost all hands and the palmists generally place the most emphasis on these
 yah rekha anguuthe ke upar hatheli ke kinare se nikalati he or kalai kii disha main mehrab kii shakl main badhati he
 This line is believed to represent a person's energy and strength, physical health and general well-being
 aisa bhi mana jaataa he ki jivan rekha durghatnaon, shaareerik chot, punarsthaapan sahit jivan main aane vaale badlaavon ko pratibimbit karti he
 Contrary to popular belief, modern palmists generally do not believe that the length of a person's lifeline is associated with a person's age
 atirikt mukhya rekhaon yaa roopon main shaamil hai: According to palmistry, this line provides a person with intensity of purpose or concentration towards an objective, whose nature is determined by the correct position of this line on the hand and any branches arising from it, which is a common case
 un haathon main, jinamein aisi rekha bina kisi shakha ke ekal chihn ke rup main maujuud hoti he, vah atyant gahan prakruti kii ore sanket karti he or vyaktiyon kii vishesh dekhbhaal kii jarurat hoti he
 The normal position of this line begins below the largest finger and normally ends where the heart line ends at the side of the hand under the little finger, indicating the average interests of the person and the depth of the temperament
 Purely determined by the direction of any branches originating from here
 hatheli ke upree aadhe hisse, jo ungaliyon turant neeche hota he, vyakti ke ucchtar yaa bauddhik swabhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or hatheli ke nichalaa aadha hissaa vyakti ke swabhaav ke bhautikwaadi paksh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 If one of these half-sides is larger, which is determined by the central position of the main line or in this case by the single transverse palm line, the person exhibits a broader developmental aspect of nature
 haalanki yah ek aam siddhant he ki agar yah rekha apni saamaanya sthiti se neeche hoti he to isse gahan bauddhik swabhaav kaa sanket miltaa he, par agar yah apni saamaanya sthiti se upar hoti he, to ghor bhautikwaadi prakruti or hiton ko darshata he
 The direction of any branching originating from this line has a significant effect on this line, leading to appropriate modifications from the results defined above, and is based on the nature of the hand bulge
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi is rekha se ek shakha anguuthe ke bilkul vipareet chandramaa ke ubhaar par haath ke nichle kinare kii ore badhati he to yah sanket karata he ki vyakti bhavuk swabhaav or kaaphi hichkichanevaala he
 Other short lines: is tarah ke sach ko tark kii kasuti par kasne vaale log aksar hastrekhavidon ko kathith maansashasthri kii shrenee main rakhte hai, "cold reeding" naam kii takanic kaa prayog karte hai
 Cold reading is considered to be an exercise in which all types of line study, including palmists, have to appear before the psychologist
 ek thode vyapak rup se sweekaarya khoj ke mutabik hastrekha shaastra kii sateekta ko charitra vishleshan kii ek pranali ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he or abhi tak nirnaayak saboot nahin mila he ki hatheli kii rekhaon or vyakti ke charitra ke bich koi sambandh hota he
 Beyond that the analysis should decide on a logical basis whether a person is suffering from a chromosomal disorder or a certain proportion of statistical groups are associated with their scores
 jivan kaal yaa vyaktitv ke prakaar ke sambandh main hastrekhavid dwaara kiye gaye daavon ke samarthan main abhi tak koi nirnaayak aankada yaa tathy nahin paaya gaya he
 Samyapya Siddhanta is the Hindi version of Cypress Doctrine
 cypress doctrin ek norman french shabd he jiskaa shabdic arth he - 'utana sameep jitna sambhav ho'
 This is a legal doctrine that first arose in the Samanya Courts
 dharmik nyaas kii ek visheshta yah he ki yadi vasiyat karne vaale ne apane vil main daan ke nimitt purna evam nishchit ichha prakat kii he, athwa vil main kathith vivaranon se nyaayalay is nishkarsh par pahunchataa he ki vil karne vaale ne danarth apni sampatti di he, to nyaayalay daan ko vyarth nahin hone degaa
 That is, the court will order the property donated in the Will to be spent as much as possible for charity
 yadi vil main kathith daan ke lakshya kaa astitv bhi kabhi nahin rahaa ho, tathaapi nyaayalay ek daatavya yojana taiyaar karakar vil karne vaale kii ichha kii purti hone degaa
 But in order for the principle of affinity to be applied, the goal of charity must be undisputed
 dhan kii koi raashi daan yaa deshbhakti ke lakshya main lagane par, daan vyarth ho jayega kyonki isse daan ke nimitt daata kii ekant bhaavana pragat nahin hoti
 Patriotism is out of the definition of charity
 aisi sthiti main daan ke nimitt nirdisht raashi sampada ke avshesh main aa jaaegi evam vil ke anusaar avshesh ke uttaradhikari is raashi main bhokta honge
 But if any amount is given for charity or charity, then the donation will not be in vain, as the goal of charity and philanthropy is not considered to be odd
 yadi vil karne vaala daatavya tata adaatavya lakshyon ke bich sampatti kaa vibhaajan na kar sakaa ho to nyaayalay ukt rakam ko donon lakshyon ke bich samaan bhaag main baant degaa
 When and how the origins of the Samyapya theory originated is uncertain
 kintu nyaayadhish lard eldan ne magiraj banaam thacewel 70 veg, 69 main kaha tha ki ek samay tha, jab england main prayek vyakti ke estate ke avshesh kaa ek ansh danarth vyay hota tha evam sampatti kaa uttaradhikari vyakti naitik drushti se aisa karnaa apana kartavya samajhataa tha, kyonki samajha jaataa tha ki vil karne waalon main daan kii bhaavana rahati he
 When the division of property has become mandatory by law, it is not impossible to think that the same principle has been applied in charity property
 samipya siddhant ko lagu karne main do pratibandh ullekhneey hai- If the will has indicated the goal of donation, however, the implementation of the goal is impossible or impractical, or such a plan cannot be continued in the future, then the court shall incur the said amount for any other goal as closely resembling the goal of the Will
 Will order to do
 dekhie, etorni general banaam di aayran mangars kan
 10, si-el
 and epa
, 908
 If the amount given in the will is more than the former for the target or the amount exceeds the requirement, then the principle of proof will be applicable in the use of more than the amount
 dekhie, ri rabertson 2 chanceri, 71
 It is impossible to put any rules in terms of what is required to show the purpose of charity
 nyaayalay dwaara die gaye nirnyon se udaar evam anudaar donon vivritiyaan parilakshith hoti hai
 If the specified donation is mixed with other donations, which are self-fulfilling and unambiguous, then the spirit of charity becomes clear
 dekhie, ri nox chanceri 109
 But if there is a particular charitable goal in the mind of the will and the achievement of that goal is not possible, then the donation will be wasted and the amount donated will be returned to the donor and if donated by the will then that amount Will come in the remains
 dekhie, ri hwites trust, 33 chanceri 449
 If the will has donated for a particular goal and that goal has disappeared before his death, it will be difficult for the court to retire the charitable spirit for the said goal
 nyaayalay ne yadi daatavya bhaavana nahin pai to daan ke liye lakshith sampatti avshesh main mil jaaegi
 Similarly, if the donation is given to a particular person and he has already died before doing the devotion, then the said donation will cease
 daatavya lakshya yadi koi sanstha ho or yah vil karne vaale kii mrityu ke samay vartmaan ho, kintu peeche lupt ho jaae, to sampatti sarkaar kii ho jaaegi or sarkaar iske nimitt samipya siddhant lagu karegi

 neo-aflatunism, the last sect of Greek philosophy that flourished in the third century BCE, kept the decadent Greek philosophy alive for about three hundred years, or until the closure of the Academy of Athens by the command of the Roman Emperor Justin in 529 AD 
 sansthaapakon ne is sampradaay kaa naam aflatoon se jodakar, ek ore to sarvshereshth samajhe janevaale unani darshanik ke prati apni shraddha prakat kii; duusari ore, visham paristhitiyon main apane mat kii pramanikta siddh karne kaa isse acha koi upaay na tha
 To infer from its name that it was merely following the opinion of Aflatun, not expedient
 unani darshan kaa prarambh paashchaatya sabhyataa ke shishav kaal main hua tha
 The above philosophy reached the peak of its development till the philosophy of Aflatoon and his disciple, Aristotle
 kintu, vishwa tathaa maanav kii moulik samasyaon kaa kaai santoshprad samaadhaan nahin diya ja sakaa tha
 The most important aspect of Aflatoon's philosophy is that it has kept all those ideologies, which present a picture of the entire cultural development from the beginning to the time of Aflatoon
 yah pravriti plato ke baad ke anya sampradaayon main bhi pai jaati he
 But in the last sect, neo-aflatunism, apart from learning from the fundamental ideologies of Aflatun, the philosophy of the later philosophical sects has also benefited
 is prakaar, yah darshan unani darshan ke kramik vikaas kaa fal kaha ja saktaa he
 The most essential fact in relation to this is that under changing circumstances, it tried to make secular Greek philosophy a favorite of the Roman Empire
 isaki gatividhi samajhane ke liye, aflatoon se lekar isa kii teesri shatabdi tak bikhare hue vichaarsutron par nigaah daalane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Socrates has the credit for running a wave of revolution in the life and philosophy of Greece
 us sant ne aaajeevan apane samay ke tathakthith gyaan kii aalochana kii or naitik chintan tathaa dharmik anubhav ke abhaav par khiz prakat kii
 Influenced by Socrates, Aflatun tried to give the preceding ideas the form of systematic philosophy
 usne parmenidis kii pratyayatmak satta ko drusht jagat kaa mul kaaran maanakar, sookshm tathaa sthool, ek evam anek kaa tathaa heraclitis ke anusaar chetan evam achetan kaa samanvay karnaa chaha tha
 However, due to the subtle affix and physical opposition to the physical object, he needed a link between the two
 purvavarti bhautikwaadiyon ke samane yah prashn prastut hi nahin hua tha, kyonki ve vishwa main kisi dwait kii kalpana hi nahin karte the
 There was no question of duality before Parmenides and other followers of Ilya, his followers
 ve sabhi to advaitavaadi the
 There was no question of duality in Heraclitus
 ve sabhi to advaitavaadi the
 Heraclitus had little glimpse of duality, as he raised the question of one and many
 par, apane roopaantar ke siddhant se hal bhi kar liya tha
 Although the principle of metamorphosis was not solved, because the speed, which he considered to be the universal law of the world, was just an illusion when one and several metamorphoses
 aflatoon samanvay kar rahaa tha
 He did not want to consider the senses world to be untrue in terms of meaningfulness of behavior
 pratyay bhi asat nahin ho saktaa tha, kyonki yadi vah pratyay ko asat maan letaa to sat kii utpatti asat se manani padati
 In an effort to sustain both, he imagined two worlds, the suffix world and the object world
 kintu donon main taratamya banaae rakhane ke liye pratyayon ko vastuon kaa saar sweekaar kiya
 Aristotle tried hard to eradicate the duality established by Aflatoon
 par, vah bhi aakaar or padaarth ke dwait kii hi sthapana kar sakaa
 Aflatun could not get any great success in solving the moral problem, because in the highest suffix, which he considered to be the root cause of the world, he was relieved of his responsibility by coordinating the truth, auspicious and beautiful
 rdhm kii samasya bhi vahiin rah gai thi, jahaan use sucraat or pithagoras ne chhod diya tha
 Both philosophers presented evidence of the realization of the highest truth in mental attachment, but no theoretical explanation of that feeling
 arestu ke jivan ke saath hi saath unani rajasatta kaa lop ho gaya or athens ke darshanikon ko sameepvarti purvi deshon main sharan leni padi
 There, especially in Alexandria, he came into contact with the budding Christianity
 tab unhen pataa chalaa ki us dharm main bhi, aflatoon ke darshan kii bhanti, dwait sattaaon kii kalpana vidyaman thi
 The mediator was conceived in the same way that the difference was so much that Christianity had a personality in God
 par, yah to kaafii janchnewali baat thi
 It was more interesting for the human intellect to aspire to become the controller and the nurturer, because of the awareness of the person of God than the highest suffix
 atev alexandria ke darshanikon ne aflatoon kii moulik satta or isai dharm ke ishwar kii ekta kaa pratipaadan kiya
 There is ample evidence of a mixture of Greek philosophy and Christianity in Philo's philosophy
 kathinaayee yah thi ki isai dharm main madhyasth kii kalpana samuchit na thi
 Stoic philosophers were remembered for this
 stoic bhautik advaitavaadi hone ke naate jagat tathaa ishwar donon ko paraspar sambhddha rakhane ke liye unhen bhi kisi madhyasth kii kalpana kerani thi
 Heraclitus called fire the first element
 stoikon ne agni tathaa buddhi main koi antar na paaya
 Therefore, he assumed that as fire distributes its heat around it in spite of being a material substance, similarly God spreads intelligence, which pervades both the world and man
 isi sanket ke aadhaar par, philo ne 'logas' ko ishwar or jagat ke bich kii kadi maan liya
 But Philo's 'lagas' was not a substance
 vah ishwar kii shakti he, vichaar he, jo prati sharir bhinn hokar 'logaai' bhi ban saktaa he
 The substance was considered by Philo to be a bond of the soul
 isliye use ishwar or logas se alag rakhaa tha
 The ideology of this Philo took the form of neo-aflatoonism till the third century
 sansthaapak ke sthaan par ammonious saccus kaa naam liya jaataa he, kintu vah hamaare liye keval ek naam he
 Possibly, he died around 242 AD
 uske darshan kaa gyaan hamen uske shishy, platinus, ke granthon se hota he
 He was born around 204 AD in a place called Lycopolis, Egypt
 245 i
 main vah rome chalaa gaya tha
 While teaching his philosophy, he died in 270 AD
 arestu ke tarkshastra ke vyakhyaakaar porphiri ne platinus ke granthon kaa chah khandon, main jinamein se prayek main nau granth hai, sampadan kiya tha, jo uplabdh hai
 Therefore Platinus is the founder of neo-colonialism for us
 platinus ne alexandria ke isai darshanikon ke mat main ek bahut bada parivartan kiya tha
 They considered God to be paramount, so far away, so isolated that in the end, they had to call God agnostic
 platinus ne sucraat or pithagoras ke tanmayata ke vichaar se shiksha lekar, tanmayata kii avasthaa main use aatma kaa prapya bataaya
 Due to this principle, neo-paganism is considered to be the originator of the mysticism of Western philosophy
 is prakaar is darshan main saidhantik evam vyavhaarik donon paksh sammilit hai
 Three main parts can be considered in the theoretical aspect of Platinus's philosophy - primary power, thought and soul and material world
 platinus kii praathmik satta ishwar he
 He is one, infinite and infinite
 vahi sabhi simit evam parimit vastuon kaa strot tathaa unki kaaranta he
 It is auspicious, because all things have their purpose
 par ishwar par naitik gunon kaa aarope nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki gun seemaa hai
 He is a leader
 jivan evam vichaar kaa aarope bhi sambhav nahin, kyonki vah to sabhi sattaaon se pare hai
 It is an active force, which without any motion, without change and degradation, continuously produces different entities than itself
 uskaa utpaadankarya bhautik nahin balki prasaaran he
 The primary entity, or, the first satta, first of all manifests the 'nous'
 'noose' sat kaa praturup evam sabhi vastuon kaa saar he
 He is both power and thought
 sat kaa praturup hone se vah usee ke swabhaav kaa he
 It is also different, because it has arisen from power
 isiilie, vah ishwar or jagat ke bich madhyasth he
 The soul is a model of this 'nous'
 atev, noose se aatma ke vahi sambandh he, jo noose ke ishwar se
 Clearly, the soul is immaterial
 vah noose or vyavhaarajagat ke bich kin kadi he
 But there is also a difference
 noose avibhajya he; kintu aatma vibhajya he
 Only then can she relate to the physical world
 ek rahete hue jagat se sambhddha hokar vah jagadatma banati he; prati sharir bhinn hokar vahi jeevatma banati he
 These souls can live a holy divine life, following the laws of Naus
 par, aisa nahin hota
 With a desire to be independent, they become disenchanted with the nous and indulge in the aesthetic pleasures of the world
 tabhi bandhan main padati hai
 But this bonding of the soul is not permanent by desire
 sansar se vimukh hokar, aatma apana mul swabhaav praapt kar sakati he
 This is where Platinus gets the opportunity to develop the practical side of his philosophy
 vah bataata he ki sansar main bhatki hui aatma ko pehle apane aapmen waapas aana padataa he
 Then, she is located in Naus
 tab vah ishwarmilan kii kaamana kar sakati he
 An attempt to complete this process can be made in three levels
 ye str naitik aacharan ke abhyaas ke teen str hai - naarik, shodhak tathaa daivi aacharan
 First, the practice of mutual love and goodwill, then the holy life and then being God-oriented
 is prakaar, aatma pehle apane aapmen aati he, phir noose main sthit hoti he or tab ishwar, pratham sat yaa apane kaaran se milane kii ichha karti he
 No duration of union
 satat ishwarchinthan or milane kii kaamana karte-karte, tanmayata ke ve kshan kabhi bhi aa sakate hai, jinamein vah kaaran main leen ho jaaegi
 According to Platinus, at moments of solitude there is inexpressible bliss and the soul bathes in eternal light
 parphiri ne bataaya he ki apane chah varsh ke adhyayankaal main, usne apane guru ko chaar baar us avasthaa main paaya tha, jiskaa unhone apane granthon main upadesh kiya ho
 Whether this statement is true or not, Parfiri was deeply influenced by his Guru's practice and throughout his life he preached his teachings
 ymblicus ne platinus ke mat kaa syria main prachaar kiya
 Iamblikus propagated the idea of platinus in Syria
 ymblicus ne platinus ke mat kaa syria main prachaar kiya
 The younger Plutarch and Proclus preached the same teachings at the Academy of Athens
 proklas ke baad to academy band hi ho gai
 Thus, the neo-aflatunism of Platinus was the last form of Greek philosophy
 kintu jivit sampradaay kaa rup na rahane par bhi naalflatunavaad paashchaatya darshan se lupt na hua
 Pythagoras and Socrates did not explain their mystic method
 yah pehla avasar tha, jab satya ke saakshaatkaar kii baat vyavasthit dhang se kahi gai thi
 Therefore, there is a full chance to think that wherever it comes to interviewing truth in later philosophy, it is the effect of neo-aflatoonism
 is prakaar madhyakaalin isai santon main se anek ko, jaise thomas equinus, arigena, bruno aadi ko, ukt mat se prabhavit samajha ja saktaa
 This effect is also found in modern times
 antardrushtivaadee sabhi rahasywaadee the
 Henry Bergsan died in 1941
 usne to sabhi vastuon ke satya gyaan ke liye buddhi ko aparyaapt bataakar, antardrushti ke dwaara unke antar main ghuskar dekhne kii sammati di thi
 Therefore, it would not be unsuitable to say that believers in the method of platinus exist so far in Western countries
 itnaa vyapak tha yah sampradaay

 The epic Sriramacharitamanas was ranked 46th among the world's 100 best popular poetry
 adhikansh vidwaan tulsidas kaa janm sthaan rajapur ko maanane ke paksh main hai
 Although some also consider it as the Soro Sukkshetra
 rajapur uttar pradesh ke chitrakoot jila ke antargat sthit ek gaanv he
 There lived an eminent Sarauparin Brahmin named Atmaram Dubey
 unki dharmapatni kaa naam hulsi tha
 Tulsidas was born here in the same nakshatra moola nakshatra on the seventh day of the bright fortnight of Shravan month of Samvat 1511
 prachlit janashruti ke anusaar shishu baarah maheene tak maan ke garbh main rahane ke kaaran atyadhik hrisht pusht tha or uske mukh main daant dikhaayi de rahe the
 As soon as he was born, he pronounced the name Rama, which gave him the name Rambola
 unke janm ke duusare hi din maan kaa nidhan ho gaya
 The father handed over the child to a maid named Chuniya to avoid any further evils and disabused himself
 jab rambola saade paanch varsh kaa hua to chuniyaan bhi nahin rahi
 He was forced to live like an orphan wandering the streets
 bhagwaan shankaraji kii prerana se ramshail par rahanevaale shri anantanand ji ke priy shishy srinaraharyanand ji ne is rambola ke naam se bahucharchit ho chuke is balak ko dhund nikaala or vidhivat uskaa naam tulsiram rakhaa
 Thereafter, he took him to Ayodhya and performed his yagyopavit-sanskar there in 1561 Magh Shukla Panchami
 sanskaar ke samay bhi bina sikhaaye hi balak rambola ne gayatri-mantra kaa spashth uccharan kiya, jise dekhakar sab log chakit ho gayi
 After this, Narhari Baba, after performing the five rites of Vaishnavas, gave the child the initiation of Ram-mantra and made him study while staying in Ayodhya
 balak rambola kii buddhi badi prakhar thi
 What he would hear from Guru-mukha in one go, he would become memorized
 vahaan se kuch kaal ke baad guru-shishy donon shukarakshetra pahunche
 There Narhari Baba narrated the story of Rama to the child but he did not understand it well
 jyeshtha shukla trayodashi, guuruuvaar, sanwat 1583 ko 29 varsh kii aayu main rajapur se thodi hi dur yamuna ke us paar sthit ek gaanv kii ati sundari bharadwaj gotra kii kanya ratnavali ke saath unka vivaah hua
 Since Gauna was not done, he went to Kashi for some time and stayed there with Seshasanatan ji and started studying ved-vedang
 vahaan rahete hue achaanak ek din unhen apni patni kii yaad aayi or ve vyakul hone lage
 When he was no more, he returned to his birthplace Rajapur with permission from Guruji
 patni ratnavali chunki maayke main hi thi kyonki tab tak unka gauna nahin hua tha at: tulsiram ne bhayankar andheri raat main ufanti yamuna nadi tairkar paar kii or sidhe apni patni ke shayan-kaksh main ja pahunche
 Ratnavali was surprised to see her husband alone that night
 usne lok-lajja ke bhay se jab unhen chupchaap waapas jane ko kaha to ve usase usee samay ghar chalane kaa aagrah karne lage
 Fearing his unexpected stubbornness, Ratnavali taught him through a couplet composed by Tulsiram, which made him Tulsidas
 ratnavali ne jo doha kaha tha vah is prakaar he: Hearing this couplet, he left his wife's house there at the same time and returned back to his village Rajapur
 rajapur main apane ghar jaakar jab unhen yah pataa chalaa ki unki anupasthiti main unke pita bhi nahin rahe or puraa ghar nasht ho chukaa he to unhen or bhi adhik ksht hua
 He paid obeisance to his father lawfully and started living in the village and narrating the story of Lord Rama to the people
 kuch kaal rajapur rahane ke baad ve pun: kaashi chale gayi or vahaan kii janata ko ram-katha sunaane lage
 During the story, he found a phantom in the guise of a man, who told him the address of Hanumanji
 hanuman ji se milakar tulsidas ne unase raghunathji kaa darshan karaane kii prarthana kii
 Hanumanji said- "you will see Raghunathji in Chitrakoot
 " is par tulsidas ji chitrakoot kii ore chal pade
 After reaching Chitrakoot, he set his posture at Ramghat
 ek din ve pradakshina karne nikle hi the ki yakaayak maarg main unhen shriram ke darshan hue
 He saw that two very handsome princes were riding on horses and carrying bows and arrows
 tulsidas unhen dekhakar aakarshith to hue, parantu unhen pahchaan na sake
 Then when Hanumanji came from behind and told him the whole secret, he started to repent
 is par hanumanji ne unhen satvana di or kaha praatavkaal phir darshan honge
 Lord Shri Ram reappeared in front of them on Wednesday on the Mauni Amavasya of Samvat 1607
 unhone balak rup main aakar tulsidas se kaha-"baba! hamen chandan chaiye kya aap hamen chandan de sakate hai?" hanuman ji ne sochaa, kahin ve is baar bhi dhokhaa na kha jaayen, isaliye unhone tote kaa rup dhaaran karke yah doha kaha: Seeing that wonderful image of Tulsidas Shri Ram, he forgot his own mind and mind
 antatogatva bhagwaan ne swayan apane haath se chandan lekar apane tathaa tulsidas ji ke mastak par lagaaya or antardhyaan ho gayi
 In Samvat 1628, he took Hanuman's orders and proceeded towards Ayodhya
 un dinon prayag main magh mela laga hua tha
 They stayed there for a few days
 parv ke chah din baad ek vatvriksh ke neeche unhen bharadwaj or yajyavlky muni ke darshan hue
 There had been the same story, which he had heard from his master in Sukrkshetr
 magh mela samaapt hote hi tulsidas ji prayag se pun: waapas kaashi aa gayi or vahaan ke prahladghaat par ek brahman ke ghar nivas kiya
 While living there, poetry-power emerged in him and he started writing poetry in Sanskrit
 parantu din main ve jitne padya rachate, raatri main ve sab lupt ho jate
 This incident happens every day
 aathven din tulsidas ji ko swapn hua
 Lord Shankar ordered them to compose poetry in their own language
 tulsidas ji kii neend uchat gayi
 He got up and sat down
 usee samay bhagwaan shiv or parvati unke saamne prakat hue
 Tulsidas ji prostrated him
 is par prasann hokar shiv ji ne kaha- "tum ayodhya main jaakar raho or hindi main kavy-rachana karo
 With my blessings, your poem will flourish like Samveda
 " itnaa kahkar gaurishankar antardhan ho gayi
 Tulsidas ji, following his orders, went straight from Kashi to Ayodhya
 sanwat 1631 kaa prarambh hua
 In that year yoga came on the day of Ram Navami in the same way as it was on the day of Rama's birth in Tretayuga
 us din praatavkaal tulsidas ji ne shriramcharitamanas kii rachana prarambh kii
 This wonderful book was completed in two years, seven months and twenty six days
 sanwat 1633 ke margshirsh shuklapaksh main ram-vivaah ke din saaton kand purna ho gayi
 After this, Tulsidas came to Kashi by the command of God
 vahaan unhone bhagavan vishwanath or mata annapurna ko shriramcharitamanas sunaaya
 At night the book was kept in the vishwanath-mandir
 praat:kaal jab mandir ke pat khole gayi to pustak par likhaa hua paaya gaya-satyam shivan sundaram jiske neeche bhagavan shankar kii sahi thi
 At that time, the people present there also heard the voice of "satya Shivam Sundaram" with their ears
 idhar kaashi ke panditon ko jab yah baat pataa chali to unke man main irshyaa utpann hui
 They started making a team and condemned Tulsidas ji and tried to destroy that book
 unhone pustak churaane ke liye do chor bhi bheje
 The thieves went and saw that two youths were guarding the bow with a bow around the Tulsidas ji's hut
 donon yuvak bade hi sundar kramash: shyaam or gaur varna ke the
 As soon as they saw him, the thieves' intelligence became pure
 unhone usee samay se chori karnaa chhod diya or bhagwaan ke bhajan main lag gayi
 Tulsidas ji looted all the things of his life and suffering for God, and kept the book with his friend Todarmal
 iske baad unhone apni vilakshan samaran shakti se ek duusari prati likhi
 On the basis of this, other copies were prepared and the promotion of the book started increasing day by day
 idhar kaashi ke panditon ne or koi upaay na dekh shri madhusudan saraswati naam ke mahapandit ko us pustak ko dekhakar apni sammati dene kii prarthana kii
 Madhusudan Saraswati ji was very happy to see him and wrote his comment on it - iskaa hindi main arth is prakaar he-"kaashi ke anand-van main tulsidas saakshaat chalata-phirata tulsi kaa paudha he
 His poetry is very beautiful, on which the temple of Shriram always hovers
 " The Pandits were also not satisfied with his comment
 tab pustak kii pariksha kaa ek anya upaay sochaa gaya
 In the Vishwanath-temple of Kashi, the Vedas were placed at the top in front of Lord Vishwanath, the scriptures under them, the Puranas under the scriptures and the Ramcharitmanas under them
 praatavkaal jab mandir kholaa gaya to logon ne dekha ki shriramcharitamanas vedon ke upar rakhaa hua he
 Now all the priests were very ashamed
 unhone tulsidas ji se kshamaa maangi or bhakthi-bhav se unka charanodak liya
 When Tulsidas ji started living on the famous ghat Aseighat of Kashi, one night Kali Yuga came to him in physical form and started tormenting him
 tulsidas ji ne usee samay hanuman ji kaa dhyaan kiya
 Hanuman ji appeared visually and asked him to create a prayer post, after which he wrote his last work Vinaya Patrika and dedicated it to the feet of God
 shriram ji ne us par swayan apane hastakshar kar diye or tulsidas ji ko nirbhay kar diya
 Shravana Krishna Tritiya on Saturday in 1680, Tulsidas ji gave up his body, saying "ram-ram"
 tulsidas ji kii hastlipi atyadhik sundar thi lagata he jaise us yug main unhone calography kii kala aati thi
 a copy of the Ayodhyakanda of Sriramcharitmanas is preserved in a temple of his birthplace, Rajapur
 usee prati ke saath rakhe hue ek kavi madanlaal verma 'krant' kii hastlipi main tulsi ke vyaktitv va krititv ko rekhaankit karte hue nimnlikhit do chand bhi ullekhneey hai jinhen hindi academy dilli kii patrika indraprastha bharti ne sarvapratham prakashit kiya tha
 The first verse in these is the overview, which is the feature that each step begins with the word that ends with it
 pratham va antim shabd bhi ek hi rahata he
 It has been called a wonderful verse in poetry
 yahi chand ek anya patrika sahityaparikrama ke tulsi jainti visheshank main bhi prakashit hue the vahiin se uddhrut kiye gayi hai In his long life span of 126 years, Tulsidas composed the following classics in chronological order - inamen se ramcharitamanas, vinay-patrika, kavitawali, gitavali jaisi kritiyon ke vishay main kisi kavi kii yah arshvani sateek prathit hoti he - pashy devsy kavyan, na mrinoti na jiryati
 That is, see the poetry of devpurus, which does not die or become old
 lagbhag chaar sau varsh purv tulsidas ji ne apni kritiyon kii rachana kii thi
 Even in that period devoid of modern publishing facilities, Tulsidas's poetry had reached the masses
 yah unke kavi rup main lokapriy hone kaa pratyaksh pramaan he
 By reading a large book like Manas, the normal educated people were also becoming famous for their purity and knowledge
 ramcharitamanas tulsidas ji kaa sarvaadhik lokapriy granth rahaa he
 He has not mentioned anything in relation to his works, hence there is a lack of in-depth evidence regarding authentic works
 nagari prachaarini sabha kaashi dwaara prakashit granth is prakaar hai : Grierson also mentions the first twelve texts above in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics
 yah sanskaar geet he
 Certain references in this song are different from the story of ram-vivah
 vairaygy sandipani ko mataprasad gupt ne apramanik mana he, par acharya chandravali pandey ise pramanik or tulsi kii aarambhik rachana maanate hai
 Solid evidence can be found by the availability of some more ancient copies
 sant mahima varnan kaa pehla soratha pesh he - Scholars have declared it a creation of Tulsi
 style kii drushti se yah tulsidas kii pramanik rachana he
 Only a fragmented copy of it is edited in the bibliography
 yah tulsi kii pramanik rachana prathit hoti he
 Its poetic maturity is compatible with the Tulsi theory
 kavita saral, subodh rochak or saras he
 "" Jagat Matu Pitu Sambhu Bhavani "" is not even a little bit of the aesthetic efforts
 lok reeti itani yathasthiti se chitrit hui he ki yah sanskrit ke shiv kavy se kam prabhavit he or tulsi kii mati kii bhaktyaatmak bhoomika par virachit katha kavy he
 The poet has carefully noted the solidity of behaviors, the exclusivity of love, and the plausibility of the matrimonial program
 tulsidas apni is rachana se atyant santusht the, isiilie is anasakt bhakt ne keval ek baar apni mati kii saraahna kii he - Scholars have placed it in the authentic compositions of Tulsidas
 par isamen bhi kshepak he
 Before the Tulsi Manas, the story of Valmiki Ramayana was popular
 kaashi ke panditon se maanas ko lekar tulsidas kaa matbhed or maanas kii prati par vishwanath kaa hastakshar sambandhi janashruti prasiddh he
 This astrology is the scripture of the classical method
 dohon, saptakon or sargon main vibhakt yah granth ramakatha ke vividh mangal evam amangalamay prasangon kii mishrit rachana he
 In terms of poetry, the importance of this book is negligible
 sabhi ise tulsikrut maanate hai
 It lacks a story-series and the translations of the Valmiki Ramayana are translated into several couplets
 dohavali main adhikansh dohe maanas ke hai
 The poet has written devotions and love by writing a long series of couplets from the Vyasa of Chatak
 dohavali doha sankalan he
 Some non-fiction couplets of Manas also have a place in it
 sambhav he kuch dohe isamen bhi prakshipt hon, par rachana kii apramanikta asandigdh he
 Kavitavali is a work of Tulsidas, but this composition published in the Sabha edition or other editions does not seem complete
 kavitawali ek prabandh rachana he
 Irrelevance and laxity in the plot will be called the stigma of Tulsi's art

 This unethical and anti-social behavior of food businessmen is found in all countries of the world, but it is seen more in uneducated, poor and underdeveloped countries

 Extracting some portion of the butter from the milk and selling it as pure milk, or reselling the dried tea leaves once used, are examples of blending without adulteration
 isi prakaar bina kisi milawat ke ghatiya vastu ko shuddh evam vishesh gunakari ghoshit kar jhuthe daawey sahit aakarshak naam dekar janata ko thaga ja saktaa he
 For this reason, words like 'adulteration' or 'mixture' are not completely meaningful for food development work

 Every state of India had the necessary laws related to pure food, but the Government of India felt the need to bring uniformity in all the territorial laws, by properly studying the prevailing laws in the country and abroad, in 1954, the food-adulteration-prevention Act all the countries Implemented in India and issued necessary regulations in 1955 under it

 With this, the vehicle can run at a much higher velocity than the speed of light according to the normal time period, even after running less than the speed of light in this twisted time

 Thus on 28 / 9 / 1925, his father-like guru Dr
 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, his disciples Dr
 Hedgewar, Mr
 Paranjpe and Bapu Sahib Soni laid the foundation of a Hindu youth club, which was later renamed the National self-service Association

 In this, all the people who believe in and practice the views of religions and religions like Sanatani, Aryasamaji, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh etc
 are Hindu The Muslims and Christians did not fall under this definition, so it was decided not to take them in this militia and it was decided to take only Hindus, the main mantra
 Was "prevention of Ambiguity and Military Causes of Hindus"

 Prayers also came to be known as "prayers" started in Sanskrit language instead of Marathi
 For senior volunteers, OTC Camps were started where they were also given paramilitary education
 For all these works, the services of a retired military officer Mr
 Martande Rao Jog were used
 By 1935-36 such branches were limited to Maharashtra only and its volunteers
 The number was only a few thousand, but the enthusiasm of the Sarsanghchalak and volunteers was worth seeing
 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis
 " jab vir saavarkar ratnagiri main drushti band the, tab dow headgavar vahaan unase milane gayi
 By then he had also read the book Hindutva by Veer Savarkar
 dow headgavar us pustak ke vichaaron se bahut prabhavit hue or uski saraahna karte hue bole ki “vir saavarkar ek adarsh vyakti he”
 Both believed that Hindus would be divided into casteism, untouchability, urban-migrants and regionalism, till Hindus would not leave blind faith, old orthodox thinking, religious fanatics, and until it would be organized and united, Until then, he will not be able to take his rightful place in the world
