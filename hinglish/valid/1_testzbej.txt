"waar" ek suryoday se duusare suryoday tak kaa samay batalaata he
 "nakshatra" is the 27th part of the eclipse and "rashi" is the 30th part
 "yoga" surya or chandra ke bhogon kaa yoga he
 To understand the reason for this, it is necessary to know one or two other things of astronomy
 akaash kaa jo gumbad jaisaa golardh bhaag hamen prithvi par dhakkan sareekha rakhaa hua bhaasith hota he, usko neeche kii ore badhaakar yadi purna gol kiya jaay, to use ham khagol kahenge
 If the floor of the equinox is extended around the earth, it will cut the astro into a circle
 is vrutt ko ham "akashiya vishuvvrutt" kahenge
 The difference between a celestial equinox visible in the sky, north or south, is called revolution of that body
 ganitshastra kaa niyam he ki jab kisi do pindon ke bhoganshi kaa yoga yaa viyog 0 yaa 180 ansh hota he, tab un do pindon kii kranti samaan hoti he or isko "krantisamya" kehete hai
 Taking the time of Suryachandra's revolution is the purpose of the "yag" part of the almanac
 itnaa samajhane ke baad ham yah soch sakate hai ki hamaara panchang sayan athwa kis aynansh kaa nirayan hona chahie
 There are only a few subjects related to astronomy in which there is no relation between Sion and Nirayana, so there is no difference between them, for example
 jo vishay do grahon ke antar par nirbhar hai, unamem bhi matbhed nahin he, kyonki grahon ke sayan or nirayan antar samaan hote hai
 The reason for this is that in taking the difference of enjoyment, the āyānāsh flies away in the disconnection process
 aise vishay he tithi or karan
 Eclipse has to take the difference between Sun and Moon in both of them
 surya ke paas yadi koi anya grah aae, to vah dikhaai nahin detaa or jab vah phir surya se dur chalaa jaataa he, tab pun: dikhaai dene lagata he
 These events are called "lopdarshan" or "udastast" of the planets
 ye ghatnaayen surya or grah ke bich ke antar par nirbhar karti he, isse inamen bhi sayan nirayan donon prakar ke ganiton se ek hi uttar aata he
 There is no relation of Sion or Nirayana method with daily rise and setting of Sun, Moon etc
 samast grah, taaraon ke bich, pashchim se purv kii ore chalate hai, magar hamaare drushtibhram ke kaaran kabhi kabhi ve hamako kuch samay tak ulti gati se, arthath purv se pashchim kii ore, chalate dikhaai dete hai
 Their speed is called "retrograde" speed
 is ghatana ke saath bhi sayan yaa nirayan paddati kaa koi sambandh nahin
 Thus some topics of almanac have no relation with Sion and Nirayan method and there are some subjects which have similar results in Sion and Nirayan mathematics
 in donon prakaaron ke vishyon main sayan or nirayan kaa matbhed nahin
 Now there are subjects whose Sion Mathematics and Nirayan Mathematics of different degrees, all of them fall apart from each other
 aise vishyon main hamako kya karnaa chahie, ab isapar vichaar karnaa aavashyak he
 The Uttarayan, Dakshinayan and Vasantadi seasons are associated with Sion count
 nirayan gananaa ke saath inkaa sambandh nahin he
 With this, these subjects should be decided according to the Sion count
 udhaahrant:, uttarayan or shishir ritu kaa aarambh 22 disambar se hi maananaa chahie, 14 janvari se nahin
 The opposite subjects are Ashwini, Bharani etc
 constellations, and Aries, Taurus etc
 ye sab taron ke samudaay hai
 These stars are stationary, so they must be calculated by calculating the constellation with constant starting position, so that the locations of the planets in between the stars can be accurately specified
 jab nirayan gananaa kii baat aati hai, tab uske sthir aarambhsthaan kaa arthath aynansh kaa prashn swaabhaavik hi utpann hota he
 Sampath and Ayan are natural, there is no difference in this regard
 nirayan gananaa kaa sthir aarambhsthaan sampaat ke sadrush naiysargik nahin, magar vah sankethik prakaar se bahujansammati se koi bhi liya ja saktaa he
 Although our pundits did not agree on this subject, the panchayat amendment limit recommended by the Indian government is now gradually being used by all almanacs
 vah is prakaar se he : 1963 i
 ke prarambh kaa aynansh 23 degree 20 minute 24
29 second or vaarshik ayangati, arthath aynansh kii vruddhi = 50
27second
 At this annual pace, Ayansha is always increasing in future times
 yadi bhootkaal kaa anaansh chahen, to is gati se ghataakar lenaa chahie
 The Ashwini Adi Nakshatra and Ariesadhi zodiac of Panchang have similar divisions of the revolution, but the Ashwini Adi and Meshadi Tarapunj of the sky are not equal in the sky
 ye samaan antar par bhi sthit nahin hai, at: panchangsth or akashasth nakshatron or raashiyon main purna saadrishy rahanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, taking a fairly stable starting point makes this analogy almost
 sampaat or ayan chal bindu hai, at: inako aarambhsthaan maanane se panchang ke or akaash ke nakshatron or raashiyon kaa saadrishy kuch samay ke baad nahin rah jayega, yah spasht he
 The purpose of the daily yogas of the almanac is the revolution of Sun Moon, it has been explained above and to accomplish this purpose, it should be done with the help of the Sion method, it has also been explained
 isamen or bhi ek baat he
 Among the Vishakambhaadi Yogas, the individual is the 17th Yoga
 ise ganit siddhant ke anusaar 14vaan rakhana chahie
 The reason for this, as we have stated above, is that the sum should be 0 degrees or 180 degrees
 surya chandra ke krantisamya ko "mahapaat" kehete hai, jo "vyatipaat" or "vaidhrut" naam se prasiddh hai
 Among them, validation is the 27th sum, which ends at 360 degrees
 180 degree par 13 yoga hote hai
 The difference with this should be 14th sum, but it is 17th
 atev uparyukt parivartan aavashyak he
 In the article titled "panchang", it is said that Vasantadi season is to be distributed for a time scale called "varsha", from which Varshaman Sion should be taken
 iske or bhi kaaran hai
 Many of our social celebrations and religious acts depend on the seasons, such as Sharathpurnim, Vasantpanchami, cool water-based food, emulsion of the Shraddha of Sharad, Nibhbhanjan of Vasant, Navnavakshan of Sharad etc
 ye sab chandra maas ke upar nirbhar hai, chandramaada adhik maas par nirbhar hai, adhik maas saura sankranti ke upar nirbhar hai or saura sankranti varshmaan ke upar nirbhar he
 If our year is not sion, then all our festivals and fasts will go in the wrong seasons
 antim 1
500 varshon main, arthath aryabhat se lekar aaj tak tak kii avadhi main hamaara, varshmaan sayan rahane ke kaaran hamaare vraton or utsavon main lagbhag 23 dinon kaa antar pad gaya he
 We call this difference "ayansh"
 yadi yahi sthiti bhavishya main bhi bani rahi to hamaari sharatpoornima vasant ritu main or hamaari vasantapanchami shardrutu main aa jaaygi
 There is only one solution to remove this anomaly and that is following Sayan Varshaman
 yah anusaran ham do prakaar se kar sakate hai : "pure Cyan" and "distinguished Cyan"
 1
 shuddh sayan - yah suvidit he
 It starts from spring season and then ends at spring break
 isamen aynansh sarvada
 rahata he
 In the time of Aryabhata, the creator of the current Hindu Panchang system, the festivities which used to be held in those seasons, will still take place in those seasons
 magar is paddati ke adhik maas vartmaan pranali ke adhik maason se bhinn aayenge
 In our astrologers today, due to lack of knowledge of "panchangism" and the celebration of different months due to different more months, pure Sion Panchang is not promoted
 yahan yah bhi samaran rakhana chahie ki panchang ke ashvini aadi nakshatra or meshadi rashiyaan to nakshatra hi rahengi
 Will remain
 sayan sankrantiyon kaa upyog adhik maas or chandra maas naam ke nirnay ke liye hoga, jaisaa aaj bhi ayanon or rituon ke liye unka upyog hota he
 2
 Specific cyan - The promotion of pure cyan almanac is difficult today, so the Panchayat Amendment Committee appointed by the Government of India has recommended the specific cyan route
 is maarg main bhi varshmaan to sayan hi rahegaa, magar aynansh 23 ansh sthir rahegaa
 The result of this is that the difference of about 23 days in our festivals and their associated seasons today, will remain stable in future and will not increase
 doosraa parinaam yah hoga ki aaj kii prachlit paddati se jo adhik maas aate he ve hi bhavishya main bhi kuch varshon tak aate rahenge, parantu aage dhire dhire unamem bhinnata badhati jaaygi
 Today's popular method and pure cyan method is the middle way between these two
 is paddati ke ashvini or mesh tathaa akaash ke in naamon ke tarapunjon main praaia: vaisaa hi saadrishy rahegaa jaisaa aajkal vartmaan he
 But after some time they will make a lot of difference
 waisi avasthaa aane par iskaa upaay bhi sochaa jaayga, jisamen hamaare aajkal ke aarambhsthaan mesh or ashvini ke badale min or uttara bhadrapada ityadi ko aarambhsthaan maanane kii vyavatha rahegi
 With these type of tips, even if the almanac is a cyan, the relationship between the almanac and the constellations of the sky will remain fine over time
 adhikansh janata kaa sambandh rituon ke saath he
 The Taradikas belong only to the Pandits, whose proportion in the general public is very small
 ve vidvan hai at: taron kii yatharth gananaa ke liye koi anya vyavastha kar sakate hai
 The "national Almanac" of the Almanac Amendment Committee appointed by the Government of India is an example of this specific cyan passage, it is stated above
 yah maarg chandra maason kii vyavastha ke liye he
 The "national Panchang" has been kept for the census day with a fixed number of solar months and each month, so that there is no increase in decay of dates and disturbances of more months
 yah vyavastha keval vyaavhaarik dinaganana ke liye he
 There are lunar months, more months, dates etc
 for religious vows
 dinaganana main varsh ke din 365 or prati chaar varsh main ek varsh ke 366 din hote he
 This always matches the national dates with the English dates, as stated in the table below
 angareji lip varsh ke anusaar hi caitra ke din 30 yaa 31 rakhe gaye hai
 Its rule is that 78 should be increased in the year of Shalivahana Shakha of the year and after considering this sum as the year of the year AD, according to Gregoro almanac, the leap year should be kept
 lip varsh main caitra kaa prarambh 21 march ko hota he or caitra ke din 31 hote hai
 In the normal year, Chaitra starts on 22 March and there are 30 days of Chaitra
 gregory lop varsh ke niyam suvidit hai
 The year that can divide the number from 4 to the remaining part is leap year and other years are normal
 magar shatabdiyon ke varshon main jis varsh kii sankhya ko 400 se ni:shesh bhaag de saken vah varsh lip he or anya shatabdi varsh saamaanya hai
 For example, Gregory years 1963 and 1900 are common and 1964 and 200 leap
 shalivahan shaq varsh 1885, 1822, 1886 or 1922 main 78 badhaane se krmanusaar 1963, 1900, 1964 or 2000 aate hai in gregory varshon ke saamaanya lip kii jo vyavastha upar batalaai gai he, vahi vyavastha anukram se shalivahan shaq varsh 1885, 1822, 1886 or 1922 he
 The above arrangement is for day census
 vrathotsvo ke liye chandra maas, adhik maas or tithi kaa bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he or iske liye 23 sthir aynansh liye jate hai
 Due to stable solstice, the seasons in which our Vratotsav falls today will continue to fall in those seasons
 ismalami panchang ke varsh main 12 chandra maas hote he
 It does not have much mass
 at: 33 varshon main sab maason main sab rituen aa jaati hai
 Such a situation is unfavorable for behavior and especially for agriculture
 at: prachlit islamic panchang ke maas or unki tarikhon ko dharmik tyohaaron ke liye rakhkar vyaavhaarik kaaryon ke liye kisi prakaar kaa sayan saura panchang rakhana hitawah hoga
 It is not difficult to create a sion solar almanac in which Islamic tradition is also protected
 is prakaar ke praytn islamic itihaas ke bhootkaal main kiye ja chuke hai, magar ve nishphal rahe
 Now such successful efforts should be done
 islamic maas kii pehali taarikh amavasya ke baad pratham chandradarshan honevaali sandhya ko padati he or mahina 29
30 dinon kaa, parvarti chandradarshan ke purv tak kaa, hota he
 Thus there are 29 days in any Islamic month and 30 days in any month
 madhyam maan se ek chandra maas main 29
53 din hote hai
 This gives 354 days in a year of 12 lunar months and 1,063 days in three years of 36 lunar months
 parsi panchang main varsh main 12 maas or maas main 30 din hote hai
 Five days after 12 months are kept for the religious activity of the "saga"
 is prakaar ek varsh main 365 din hote hai
 Although this almanac is solar, but like the Gregory almanac, the fourth year is not kept as a leap year, but after 120 years, a more month is kept
 isse rituon ke saath maason kaa antar ek maas se adhik kabhi nahin hota
 However, if we keep the saga of six days in lieu of a five-day saga every four years instead of the system, the Parsi dates and seasons will have a difference of less than a day in a century and if the "leap" of the centenary of the Gregory calendar
 If the plan of the year is approved in the Parsi almanac, then the dates of the Parsi almanac will always be in perfect harmony with the seasons
 chaar chaar varshon par ek varsh paanch dinon kii gaatha ke badale chah dinon kii gaatha rakhane kaa prayog parsi panchang main bhootkal main kiya ja chukaa he, kintu vah puraa safal nahin hua
 This experiment is called "cropped sun" and it starts from 21 March
 aajkal bhi kuch log iskaa vyavhaar karte hai, magar adhikansh log upar batalaai hui paanch dinon kii gathavali paddati hi maanate he
 There are also two distinctions again for some historical reasons
 in donon prakaar ke varshon ke aarambh main ek maas kaa antar rahata he
 Otherwise both types are same
 ek pakaar ko "kadimi" yaa "dariyaan roj" kehete hai or duusare prakaar ko "shahanshahi" yaa "yajhadejhardi" kehete hai
 We call it "gregory" almanac and its months are January, February etc
 iske vibhinn maason ke dinon kii sankhya suvidit he, at: uskaa ullekh yahan nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 The system of the "leap" year falling in it is explained above
 1582 i
 main pope gregory ne yah panchang prachlit kiya
 Prior to that, the Julian Almanac used to run
 yadhyapi yah panchang samprati antarrashtriya prayog main aa rahaa he, tathaapi isamen anek trutiyaan hai, jinhen sudhaarney ke praytn kiye ja rahe hai
 The days of his various months are 28, 29, 30, 31, but there is no simple rule
 amuk maas kii amukh taarikh kaa waar bhi saralata se nahin janaa jaataa
 Several methods have been proposed to correct such errors
 inamen se jo paddati sabase adhik lokapriy hui he use "vishwapanchang" naam diya gaya he
 His introduction is given below
 isamen, isvi or maas ke jo naam aajkal prachlit hai, ve hi rakhe gaye hai, magar maason ke din is prakaar hai
 January, February, etc
 is 31, 30, 30, 31, 30, 30 31, 30, 30, 31, 30, 30, from the sequence of 12 months
 ye sab milakar 364 din hote hai
 The year in which this almanac will begin
 janvari, april, july or oktober in maason ke 31 din hote hai or in sabaki pehali taarikh ko ravivaar hota he
 February, May, August and November are 30 days of these months and on the first date of all of these, it is Wednesday
 march, june, sitambar or disambar in maason ke bhi 30 din hote hai or un sab kii pehali taarikh ko shuukravaar hota he
 Apart from this, a day has been kept after the month of June, which is labeled as "world wise"
 yah baar saptahik vaaron se bhinn ek atirikt waar he isamen bhi lip varsh aajkal kii bhanti hi rakhaa gaya he, antar keval yah he ki farvari maas main ek din na badhaakar disambar main badhaayaa gaya he
 December's leap year will also be the extended "31st day" of the year, different from the weekly vars
 is prakaar lip varsh main do or saamaanya varsh main ek "vishwavaar" hoga
 It is clear that in this almanac also, like the Gregorian almanac, there will be 366 of the leap year and 365 days of the normal year
 at: rituchakra aajkal ke anusaar hi rahaa karegaa
 The special benefit of "vishwanchang" is that different dates of different months of every year will invariably be fixed at different times
 atev ek varsh ke liye banaaya hua waar kaa calendar sabhi varshon ke liye thik rahegaa
 This scheme of equilibrium in the war and dates is so simple that we can remember it easily and even in the absence of a calendar, one can easily know the date of any month

 Generally a state's EEZ extends to a distance of 200 nautical miles out from its coast
 The exception to this rule occurs when eezs overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nautical miles apart
 When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual boundary
 Otherwise, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the most proximate state
 The Exclusive Economic Zone starts at the coastal baseline and extends 200 nautical miles out into the sea, perpendicular to the baseline
 Thus, the EEZ overlaps both the contiguous zone and territorial waters
 This concept of allotting nations eezs to give better control of maritime affairs outside territorial limits gained acceptance in the late 20th century and was given binding international recognition by the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982
 Part V, Article 55 of the Convention states: Fisheries management is a significant aspect of the resulting control
 Disputes over the exact extent of Exclusive Economic Zones are a common source of conflict between states over marine waters
 Areas where a permanent ice shelf extends beyond the coastline are also sources of potential dispute
 1,159,063 km2 Australia has the third largest exclusive economic zone, behind the United States and France, but ahead of Russia, with the total area actually exceeding that of its land territory
 As per UN convention, Australia's EEZ generally extends 200 nautical miles from the coastline of Australia and its external territories, except where a maritime delimitation agreement exists with another state
 Australia has also claimed, in its submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its Antarctic Territory but has requested it not to be considered, in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty
 However, Australia maintains the right to explore and exploit the seabed and water column within its EEZ
 Source Canada is unusual in that its exclusive economic zone, covering 2,755,564 km2, is slightly smaller than its territorial waters
 The latter generally extend only 12 nautical miles from the shore, but also include inland marine waters such as Hudson Bay, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the internal waters of the Arctic archipelago
 The EEZ of the European Union is shared, so vessels or a national from one country can fish in another country's EEZ
 The combined zone amounts to 25 million km2, making it larger than the United States' zone, the largest of any single country
 '"see: Common Fisheries Policy
 Due to its numerous overseas départements and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet, France possesses the second-largest EEZ in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2, just behind the EEZ of the United States, but ahead of the EEZ of Australia
 According to a different calculation cited by the Pew Research Center, the EEZ of France would be 10,084,201 km2, behind the United States, but ahead of Australia and Russia
 The EEZ of France covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the eezs of the world, whereas the land area of the French Republic is only 0
45% of the total land area of the Earth
 Greece has not yet claimed an exclusive economic zone, although it is entitled to do so, as per UNCLOS 1982 as well as customary international law
 The reason for its inaction is the direct Turkish threat of casus belli
 Turkey's declaration of casus belli is not related to the EEZ issue
 Aegean Sea is a semi-closed sea which has a special nature
 Moreover, Turkey is not among the signatories of UNCLOS which allows countries to expand width of their territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles
 Besides, Turkey is a persistent objector to the relevant article of UNCLOS
 In 1995, just after Greece's ratification of UNCLOS, Turkey declared that if Greece expands the width of her territorial waters over 6 nautical miles, Turkey would conceive this action as a containment attempt and a direct offence to her sovereignty
 So, Turkish Parliament decided that if Greece attempts to expand the width of her territorial waters it would be a cause of war 
 EEZ problem -which is waiting for a viable solution- is just another problem between Turkey and Greece besides other problems
 Portugal has the 3rd largest Exclusive Economic Zone of the EU and the 11th in the world
 764,071 km2 Japan has disputes over its EEZ boundaries with all its Asian neighbors
 The above and relevant maps at the Sea Around Us Project both indicate Japan's claimed boundaries, and does not take into account neighboring power's claims
 New Zealand's EEZ covers 4,083,744 km2, according to the Sea Around Us Project, which is approximately fifteen times the land area of the country
 Sources vary significantly on the size of New Zealand's EEZ; for example, a recent government publication gave the area as roughly 4,300,000 km2
 These figures are for the EEZ of New Zealand proper, and do not include the eezs of other territories in the Realm of New Zealand 
 Norway has a large exclusive economic zone of 819 620 km2 around its coast
 The country has a fishing zone of 1,878,953 km2, including fishing zones around Svalbard and Jan Mayen
 The fact that the European Union shares its economic zones was a big reason why Norway did not entered the EU as a member
 Source information needed Largest EEZ in the world: 11,351,000 km2 / 4,383,000 mi2 The Montessori method is a method used for children aged two and a half to two and a half years, developed by Dr
 Maria Montessori in the early twentieth century
 rome vishvavidhyalay main mandabuddhi baalkon kii chikitsa kaa kaary karte hue unka dhyaan ukt baalkon kii shiksha kii ore gaya or unhone maantesri paddati kaa vikaas kiya jo baad main saamaanya buddhi baalkon ke shiksha ke liye bhi upyog main laai gai
 The first school to be run on this method was opened for the children of semi-barbaric laborers in San Lorenzo on 6 January 1907
 1913 main pratham antarrashtriya maantesri prashikshan paathyakram kaa aayojan hua jisamen america, africa, bharat tathaa kai europea deshon ke log sammilit hue
 Dr
 Montessori, along with her adopted son, Mario Montessori, was engaged in spreading it throughout her life
 frobel ke shikshadarshan se dur hote hue bhi maantesri kii shiksha ke uddeshy evam siddhant frobel se milte julate hai
 Like Frobel, he also believed that it was the only real education that could express the powers of life
 aisa kar sakane ke hetu shiksha ko balak kii antarpreranaon evam nirmaanshaktiyon ke anuroop hona hoga
 The basic principle of education should be helpful in the natural development of the child and the objective should be the all-round development of the child
 chikitsashastra se sambandhit hone ke kaaran ve yah bhi maanati thim ki shiksha ko bacchon ke saadhaaran maansik evam andrik dosha jaise bhirutha, vanidosh aadi, ke sudhaar main bhi sahaayak hona chahie
 The syllabus of this education is mainly divided into four parts - Karmendriya teaching, Gyanendra teaching, language and mathematics
 camendriya shikshan ke andar kai prakaar kii "vyaavhaarik jivan kii kriyaayein, jaise pani udelnaa, kursi uthaanaa, batan kholana aadi, aati hai, jinaki sankhya ek sau ke lagbhag he
 Although every action also has its own special purpose, its simple purpose is to control the movement of the child, operate meat dishes, and teach balance
 in kriyaaon kaa doosraa saadhaaran uddeshy he bachche ko aatmanirbhar banaakar sahi arth main swatantra bananaa
 There are many learning devices for learning of knowledge, in which self-control or correction of mistake is done and those who teach the child themselves
 maantesri ke vichaar main is shiksha se na keval gyanendriyaan kushagra hoti hai varan balak kaa aatma sambandhi gyanprapti main bhi sahaayta milti he
 This idea is considered exaggerated
 bhashashikshan main padhane se purv yaa praaia: saath saath likhane kii shiksha aati he jiske liye regmal ke or lakdi ke kate aksharon kaa prayog hota he
 Preparation for writing is already done indirectly by the actions in which the child makes special use of fingers
 "chitra card" dwaara balak padhanaa aarambh karata he
 Numerical steps "number cards", accessories of beads, etc
 are many tools for mathematics education by which children are given some knowledge of counting, fractions, decimals and geometry after counting and simple arithmetic
 balak kii aavashyaktaaon kii drushti se yah paathyakram kuch apurna sa he
 It does not have proper means for the physical and social development of the child and his imaginative and creative tendencies
 maantesri paathyakram kii upyogita uparyukt abhaavon ke kaaran kuch kam ho jaati he
 Institutions like "nutan Bal Shikshan Sangh" in India have tried to make this education more profitable by filling these shortages
 is shikshapaddati kii vishesh aalochana kilpatric mahoday kii pustak "maantesri agjamind" main hui he
 According to him, Dr
 Montessori was not fully aware of the latest facts of pedophilia
 pruthak pruthak banaavati sadhano dwaara prayek gyanendriya kii shiksha amanovaigyanik he
 Some of Dr
 Montessori's statements on the benefits of Montessori education are invalid and there are many major shortcomings in her curriculum
 kintu duusari ore balochit vaataavaran, balak kii atmanarbharata tathaa swanushasan or shikshak kaa chatur sahaayak jaisaa hona is pranali ke maanya gun hai
 Practical life activities and many learning instruments are very useful
 maantesri kaa bal shiksha ke prati vaigyanik drushtikon tathaa balak ke prati unki sakriy sahanubhuti vishesh prashansaneey hai
 The prevalence of this education in India is more because Dr
 Montessori himself propagated it for ten years in India and since his departure in 1949 his personal representatives are enthusiastically engaged in this work

 Large boats which have been used since ancient times for the movement of sea and travel to distant countries, are called ships
 pehle jahaaj apekshaakrit chote hote the tathaa lakdi ke banate the
 In the modern period of technological and scientific progress, very large, mainly iron-made and engine-driven ships are made
 jis jahaaj se jo bhi kaam liya jaataa he
 Accordingly, it is designed and constructed
 at: kaary ke anusaar jahaajon ko teen virgon main baantate hai : They also have several subclasses, which are further described in chronological order below
 is varg main duubate hue jahaajon ko nikaalanevaale pot samudri taar bichaane tathaa unki marammat karanevaale, tatavarti yatropayogi chote jahaaj, bhojan saamagree le janevaale, matsay naukaaye or ghat-yaan-naukaaye aadi mukhya hai
 The structure of each ship is designed in such a way that its engines, propellants or paddle wheels, assistive devices and punches, etc
, bear the distortions and stresses caused by them, especially due to sea waves
 jahaajon ke chalate samay jab saamne kii hawa kaa mukaabila karnaa hota he
 At that time, if long waves equal to the width of the ship begin to rise, then a single large wave of plum can lift the ship in the balance in the middle
 tab jahaaj ke aage or peeche k sire thik usee prakar se latakate rahenge jaise ki kisi ladi hui shateer ko bich main se sahaara dekar uthaa liya ho
 This condition of the ship is called convexity
 kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki jahaaj kaa aage or peeche kaa sira to laharon par tik jaataa he or bich kaa sthaan khaali ho jaataa he, thik vaisaa hi jaise koi ladi hui shateer donon siron par tiki ho
 In this situation, the stresses on the structure of the ship are called concave
 kabhi kabhi in donon paristhitiyon kaa mishran bhi ho jaataa he, jisamen padanevaale pratibal kartan kehalaate hai
 When the wind moves diagonally, sometimes there are torsional forces in the structure of the ship
 jab bagali hawa chalati he tab parshviya vikrutiyaan utpann hoti hai
 Apart from this, excessive pressure of sea water on the submerged part also shows a tendency to stick to the structure
 sabase adhik tathaa vikat prakaar kii vikrutiyaan to aage or peeche ke siron par us samay paidaa hoti hai jab jahaaj main maal ke visham ladaan or laharon ke prabhaav tathaa pani ke utplavak bal ke kaaran jagah jagah par naman ghurna paidaa hone lagate hai
 When calculating the deformations caused by the waves, it is assumed that the length of each wave is equal to the width of the ship and their height is about one-third of the length
 jahaaj ke dhaanche kii abhiklpana karte samay uske prayek avyav kii rachana aisi karte hai ki usapar jo bhi pratibal pade, sab main samavibhajit hokar is prakaar se samast dhaanche main fail jaae ki prayek avyav par aanevaale jhatkon ko avyav milakar sah len
 The bottom of the ship is the basic element at the bottom, by which the entire structure is erected

 The entire structure of the ship is composed
 panjar ke samast ang angel, aayran or pattiyon dwaara hi banaae jate hai
 These registers are double, one inner and the other outer
 jin sthanon par jahaaj kaa nichalaa farsh tikta he, ve bahari or bhitari panjaron ke bich main khadey lagaae jate hai inhen mariya athwa florce bhi kehete hai
 Due to these, the penda becomes very firm
 jahaaj kii donon bagaliyon ke panjaron ko dridhtaa pradaan karne ke liye, unke bich main lamb pattiyaan tathaa aadi sthunaayen laga di jaati hai
 Perpendicular straps are inlayed by rivets with angle plates from the sides of the ship
 sampurna jahaaj kaa panjar kai khandon main banaakar prayek panjar ke upree sire par bhi ek ek dharan laga di jaati he, jo upree deck ke plate ko sahaara detii he
 In ships having more than one deck, one section each is fitted to handle each deck
 upree deck sadaiv ispaat kii platon kaa banaaya jaataa he or usapar lakdi ke takhte baitha die jate hai
 The lower decks are made of wooden planks
 kuch jahaajon main neeche ke deck bhi ispaat kii platon se banaate hai
 It all depends on usage
 jahaaj ke panjar kii aadi dharanon ke bich, unhen sahaara dene ke liye ek ek khambha bhi ispaat kaa laga diya jaataa he
 Ships that have more width have a pillar attached to either side of the middle pillar
 malwahak jahaajon ke godaamon main adhik khuli jagah kii aavashyaktaa padaa karti he
 Hence, other types of tips are employed by not placing pillars in them
 nital patticas- They are protruding out of the outer shell of the ship and are fitted with the purpose of blocking the ambush of the ship
 inke kaaran jahaaj ke khol kii lunthangati main kaaphi avrodh hota he, jisase lunthangati bilkul to nahin rukne paati, parantu kaaphi kam ho jaati he
 Throughout the length of the ship, the steel plates are made of rock-cut rooms, made of steel plates, made of brackets, ranging in height from the bottom of the bottom to the surface of the seawater
 ye kamare bade upyogi hote hai, kyonki jab ki durghatanavash jahaaj ke aavaran main kahin chhed ho jaataa hai, tab samudri pani keval uske nikatavarti kamare main hi bharkar rah jaataa he or shesh jahaaj surakshit rahata he
 Many times water is deliberately filled in a suitable room to balance the balance of goods loaded in the direction of the length of the ship
 kai puraane prakaar ke jahaajon main to ye kamare is prakaar ke bane hote the ki ek se duusare main jane ke liye unki chat main bane chhed main chadhakar duusare ke chhed main utarana hota tha

 The bottom of the ship's bottom and the sidewall, also known as the perge, are thickest
 mandaan tathaa kudas kii nikatavarti platen bhi kaaphi moti hoti hai
 Their maximum thickness is one inch
 aavaran platon kii motaai inch ke 20wein bhaag main naapane kii pratha he
 The center of the ship has the maximum width at the bottom, which is called the "joist"
 iske upar kii taraf chaudaai kramash: kam hoti jaati he, jise jahaaj ke madhya bhaag kaa bhitari jhukaav kehete hai
 It is measured on the same side from the top deck

 He was a sensitive writer, vigilant citizen, skilled speaker and sudhi editor

 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him

 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story

 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life

 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha

 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill

 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe

 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also

 Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates such as the Antarctic
 In fact, some species of penguins now live only a few south

 sabase choti prajati little blue penguin, feiri penguin ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he, kii unchai lagbhag 40 semi or vajan 1 kilogram hota he
 Among the present-day penguins, larger penguins live in colder regions, while smaller penguins are also commonly found in temperate or tropical climates
 Some prehistoric species were as tall and weighed in size as an adult human
 This species was not limited to the Antarctic regions; Rather, the Antarctic subcontinent was more diverse in the regions, and at least one giant penguin has been found in an area not far from 35 to 2000 km south of the equator and where the climate is warmer than it is today
 "penguin" shabd kii vyutpatti atyaadhik vivaadit he
 The English word is apparently not of French nor of Breton or of Spanish origin, but the first appears to be of English or Dutch language

 An alternative etymology is found in English dictionaries, which link the word to the Latin language pinguis "fat", because of its perceived shape
 yah vyutpatti asambhav hogi yadi "penguin" ko "multah" great ouk ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa tha, jaisaa ki kuch sutron kaa kahana he
 a third theory suggests that the term is a changed form of "pen-wing", with reference to the rudimentary wings of both the penguin and the Great Oak

 Some sources believe that white-handed penguins are of a different Eudyptula species, while others consider them to be subfamilies of the Little Penguin, the actual situation seems more complicated

 Given that neither the relationship of penguins to subfamilies nor the location of penguins in avian phylogeny is yet to be understood, this seems fake and somehow confusing; Hence the Linnean system established here is explained

 In the absence of direct evidence, it may be said that by the end of the Cretaceous, penguin lineages had developed differently, although not as contiguous as they are today; It is quite likely that they were not completely flightless at that time, as birds unable to fly are generally very small, leading to their initial phase of mass extinction due to low capacity

 It is not yet known whether giant Palaeudyptinae represents monophyletic generation, or whether giantia emerged separately in Palaeudyptinae and Anthroporinithinae - whether they were validated, or whether Palaeudyptinae contained a large range that was demarcated as generally Including nowadays
 Ancient and well-described giant penguins, the 5-foot-high Icadyptes salasi as far north as in northern Peru, were found 36 mya ago
 kisi bhi maamle main, peleogin ke ant main, 25 mya ke aasapaas, vishaal penguin gaayab ho gayi the
 The reason for their decline and extinction was the spread of the species that feed them, Skulodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which of course struggled to eat them and eventually succeeded
 a new lineage, the Paraptenoidites, which includes short but decidedly stout legs, had already been born in South America by that time

 "as an early species, the Pygoscelis seem to have perished during the Bertonian era, but the main cause of the diversity today is range expansion and radiation, the early Miocene up to that time, about 20–15 mya ago, from the Bardigalian phase

 These two generations diverged almost in the Middle Miocene, but once again, the surviving species of Eudyptes are the result of subsequent radiation, which lasted from the last Tortonian to the end of the Paleocene

 The emergence of the Antarctic subcontinent lineage at the end of the Bertonian coincided with the slow onset of the cooling period which eventually lasted some 3
5 million ice ages
 The main reason for the decline of habitat by the Priabonians on the Antarctic is due to the more favorable conditions in the Antarctic subfields than in the Antarctic
 Notably, the cold Antarctic Pole-like continuous current began only around 30 mya, cooling the Antarctic on the one hand and spreading Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond

 Later, a mild summer period was ended by climate change of the Middle Miocene, a sharp drop in global average temperature by 14–12 mya, and some similar cold events occurred between 8 mya and 4 mya; By the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was somewhat similar in extension and extent to what it is today

 isamen aath adhyay hai, jinamein gyaan, yoga, kriya, charya tathaa vaishnavon ke saamaanya achaarpaksh ke pramanik vivechan ke saath-saath vaishnav darshan ke aadhyatmik pramayon kii bhi pramanik vyakhya di gai he
 It is characterized by many other codes that like other tantric texts, tantric yoga is also discussed in Sangopang, although the glory of devotion is not less here
 isamen bhedabhedwaad kaa bhi paryaapt vyaakhyaan he
 On this basis, some scholars consider Pancharatra philosophy to be important for the role of Ramanuja philosophy
 romanian yaa daako-romanian ek romance bhashaa he, jise duniyabar main, visheshtaur se romania or moldova main, kariban dhai karod log bolte hai
 It has official status in Romania, Republic of Moldova and Vojvudina Autonomous Province of Serbia

 Garden lake daae, hubei, china kaa ek sarovar Reflection of two people in a pond is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Black hole ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 In general relativity, a black hole or a black hole or a Krishna vivar is such an astronomical object with such a powerful gravitational field that nothing can escape the light, including the stretch
 kalenidr ke chaaron ore ghatana kshitij naamak ek seemaa hoti he jisamen vastuen gir to sakati hai parantu baahar kuch nahin aa saktaa
 It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light falling on it and does not reflect anything
 yah ooshmaagatiki main thik ek adarsh krishnika kii tarah he
 Quantum analysis of the black hole shows that they contain temperature and Hawking radiation
 apane adrishy bhitari bhaag ke baavjood, ek kalachhidr anya padaarthon ke saath antah-kriya ke madhyam se apni upasthiti prakat kar saktaa he
 For example, the black hole can be detected at the speed of a group of stars orbiting a part of the space that appears empty
 vaikalpik rup se, ek saathi taare dwaara aap apekshaakrit chote kalenidr main gas giraate hue dekh sakate hai
 This gas spirals inwards, heating up to very high temperatures and emits large amounts of radiation that can be detected by telescopes located on Earth or orbiting the Earth
 is tarah ke avlokanon ke parinaam swaroop yah vaigyanik sarv-sammati ubhar kar saamne ai he ki, unke swayan na dikhne ke baavjood, hamaare brahmad main kalenidr astitv rakhte he
 By these methods, scientists have discovered that a radio source called Dhanu a *, located in the center of our galaxy, Kshirmarg, has a giant black hole whose mass is 43 million times the mass of our sun
 saidhantik rup se, kisi bhi maatra kaa padaarth ek kalachhidr ban saktaa he, yadi vah itani jagah ke bheetar sankuchit ho jaay jisaki trigya apni samatuly schvarsscield trigya ke baraabar ho
 Accordingly, the mass of our Sun is 3 km
 m Radius of the earth and 9 mm of the earth It can turn into black hole when inside
 vyaavhaarik rup main electron or neutron aapjatya dabaav ke vipareet na to prithvi or na hi suraj main aavashyak dravyaman he or isliye na hi aavashyak gurutvkarshan bal he
 The minimum mass required for a star to be able to recover from these pressures and to be more compressed is the extent proposed by Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff, which is about three solar masses
 ek kalenidr ko aksar ek aisi vastu rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa palaayan veg prakaash kii gati se adhik ho
 This picture is qualitatively incorrect but provides a way of understanding the order of magnitude of the radius of the black hole
 palaayan veg vah nunatam gati he jo ek vastu main honi chahie taaki vah vastu rukne se pehle kisi guruttvakarshan strot kii kaksha se bachakar nikal jaye
 The escape velocity on Earth is equal to 11
2 km / s, so no matter what the object is, a bullet or a ball, it must move at least 11
2 km / s to avoid falling back to the surface of the Earth
 neutonian yantriki main palaayan veg kii gananaa hetu, maaniye ki ek baari vastu he jiskaa dravyaman m mul par kendrit he
 a second object with a m { \ displaystyle m} mass starts at a v { \ displaystyle v} speed at a distance of r { \ displaystyle r} from the origin, tries to escape towards the infinity, with exactly the same kinetic energy
 Should be so that it can overcome the potential energy of negative gravity, leaving nothing later: is prakaar, yah jaise jaise r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r= \ infty } ke kareeb aati jaati he vaise vaise isaki gatij urja kam hoti jaati he, antat yah bina kisi gati ke ananthata par pahunch jaati he
 This formula represents the critical migration velocity v { \ displaystyle v} in terms of m { \ displaystyle M} and r { \ displaystyle r}
 lekin yah formula yah bhi kahata he ki v { \ displaystyle v} or m { \ displaystyle M} kii prayek value ke liye, r { \ displaystyle r} kii ek critical value hoti he taaki v { \ displaystyle v} gati vaala ek kan bhaagane maatr main safal rahe: When the velocity is equal to the speed of light, it provides the radius of an imaginary Newtonian dark star, a Newtonian body from which no particle moving at the speed of light can escape
 ek kalenidr kii trigya kii value ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt chalan main, ghatana kshitij kii trigya is neutonian value ke baraabar hoti he
 In general relativity, it is not easy to define r coordinates because of the curved nature of space-time and the selection of different coordinates
 is parinaam ke satya hone ke liye, r kii value ko is prakaar paribhaashit karnaa chahie taaki vakrit antariksh samay main r trigya ek sphier ke a satahi kshetra ko abhi bhi is formula dwaara prakat kiya ja sake a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle A=4 \ pi r^{2}} r kii is paribhaasha se koi arth tabhi nikalataa he jab gurutvkarshan kshetra spherickli samamit ho, taaki vahaan ek ke upar ek kai siyaar hon jinpar ekasmaan gurutvkarshan kshetra ho
 The escape velocity depends on the density of an object to escape its gravitational field; This is the ratio of its mass to volume
 ek kalachhidr tab banataa he jab koi vastu itani ghani ho jaye ki kisi khaas duuri tak prakaash bhi usase bachakar na jane paye, kyonki prakaash kii gati kalenidr ke palaayan veg se kam hogi
 Unlike Newtonian gravity, in general relativity, the light moving away from the black hole does not slow down and turn back
 schvarjaschild trigya abhi bhi vah antim duuri he jahaan se prakaash anantta ke liye batch saktaa he, lekin schvarjaschild trigya se shuru hokar baahar nikalne vaala prakaash waapas nahin aata he, vah baahar hi rahata he
 Inside the Schwarzschild radius, each object moves inwards, somehow to be crushed in the center
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr kaa dravyaman kisi gurutveey apurvata) par kendrit rah saktaa he, yah ek bindu, ek challa, ek prakaash kiran, yaa ek sphier ho saktaa he; vartmaan main iske vishay main thik thik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 There is a circular border around this singularity called the event horizon
 yah ghatana kshitij ko 'waapas lautne kaa sthaan' hota he, ek seemaa jiske pare saare padaarth or vikiran bheetar singhulerity kii taraf khinche chale aate hai
 Centrally, the distance between this singularity and the event horizon is the size of the black hole and is equal to twice the mass in the unit where g and c are equal to 1
 surya ke baraabar dravyaman vaale kalenidr kii trigya lagbhag 3 kimi hoti he
 For distances many times greater than this, the gravitational power of the black hole is exactly equal to the gravitational power of any other body of equal mass, just like the Sun
 isliye yadi surya ko samaan dravyaman vaale ek kalenidr ke parivartit kar diya jaye, grahon kii kakshaen aparivartit rahengi
 There are several types of black holes, which are identified by their specific size
 jab ve ek tara ke gurutvkarshan patan ke kaaran banate hai, unhen taarakeey kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 The mass of black holes formed at the center of galaxies can be several billion times the solar mass, they are called giant black holes because they are very large
 in donon paimaanon ke bich main kuch madhyavarti kalenidr bhi hote hai jinke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai hajaar gune tak hote hai
 Very low-mass black holes that are thought to have formed during the Big Bang in the early history of the universe may still exist and are called primordial black holes
 vartmaan main unka astitv abhi nishchit nahin he
 It is not possible to see a black hole directly
 haalaanki, aasapaas ke paryaavaran par uske guruttviya prabhaav dwaara uski upasthiti kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he, khaas kar microkvasar or sakriya gallexic nabhikon dwaara, jahaan paas ke kalenidr main girane vaale padaarth ati garam ho jate hai or eks-re vikiran kii badi maatra chhodte hai
 This observation method enables astronomers to ascertain their existence
 kalenidr ekmaatr aise padaarth hai jo in paimaanon par khare utarate hai or saamaanya saapekshata ke dhaanche ke anuroop hote hai
 The concept of a heavy body so incapable of escaping even light was revealed in a letter written by geologist John Michel to Henry Cavendish in 1783 and published by the Royal Society: 1796 main, ganitagya pierre-simon laplas ne apni kitaab exposishan du system du monde ke pehle or duusare sanskaran main isi vichaar ko badhaava diya tha 
 These "dark stars" were ignored in the nineteenth century, because then it was believed that light was a massless wave and therefore free from the effects of gravity
 aadhunik blike hole avadharana ke vipareet, aisa mana jaataa tha ki kshitij ke peeche kii vastu kaa patan nahin ho saktaa he
 In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had already proved that gravity actually affects the speed of light
 kuch maheene baad, karl schvarjaschild ne ek bindu drabyaman or ek golakaar dravyaman ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa samaadhaan diya, yah dikhaate hue ki ek blike hole kaa astitv siddhanthata sambhav he
 The Schwarzschild radius is now known as the radius of the event horizon of non-rotating black holes, but this fact was not understood at the time, for example Schwarzschild himself did not consider it physical
 johanise droste nen, hendrick lorentz ke ek chaatr, swatantra rup se bindu dravyaman par schvarjaschild ke kuch maheenon ke baad aisa hi samaadhaan diya or iske gunon ke bare main bade paimaane par or adhik likhaa
 In 1930, astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar, using general relativity, calculated that the solar mass of a non-rotating body containing electron-generated matter would collapse if it exceeded 1
44
 unke tark kaa arthur edington dwaara virodh kiya gaya tha, jinka vishwaas tha ki koi vastu nishchit rup se is patan ko rokegi
 Eddington was partially right: a slightly dwarf white dwarf star above the Chandrasekhar range would transform into a neutron star after its collapse
 But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that due to the reasons given by Chandrasekhar, a star with more than three solar masses would collapse into a black hole
 oppenheimer or unke sah lekhakon ne shwarzschild nirdeshaank pranali kaa upyog kiya, jisane shwarzschild trigya par ganitiya vishistataa ko utpaadit kiya, duusare shabdon main, is sameekaran main istamaal kiye gaye kuch ghatak shwarzschild trigya par anant ho jate the
 This implies that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped"
 yah baahar se dekhne waalon ke liye ek vaid bindu he, lekin andar girane waalon ke liye nahin
 Because of this feature, collapsed stars have been known as "frozen stars" for some time, as an external observer will see the star's surface frozen at the moment the star's collapse falls within the Schwarzschild radius
 Must be taking yah aadhunik blike holon kaa ek gyaat lakshan he, lekin is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki jame hue taare kii sataha kaa prakaash bahut jaldi redshifted ho jaataa he or blike hole ko bahut jaldi kaale rang kaa bana detaa he
 Many physicists were unable to accept the idea that time halts within the Schwarzschild radius and that people had no interest in the subject for 20 years
 1958 main, david phinkeistein ne edington-phinkelsten nirdeshaank prastut karte hue ghatana kshitij kii avadharana pesh kii, jisane unhen yah sabit karne main sakasham kiya ki schvarjaschild sataha r= 2 m ek vishistataa nahin he balki yah ek adarsh ekaladisha jhilli ke rup main kaary karata he: karnatmak prabhaav ise ek hi disha main paar kar sakate hai
 There was no significant contradiction in this and Oppenheimer's results, but it expanded it by adding a falling observer's viewpoint
 finkelstin samet, abhi tak ke saare siddhant keval gaiyr-chakrit blike holon ko cover karte the
 In 1963, Roy Kerr found the perfect solution for recurring black holes
 isaki chakrit singhulerity ek bindu nahin balki ek challa thi
 After some time, Roger Penrose is able to prove that singularity is found within all black holes
 1967 main, khagolavidon ne pulsar kii khoj kii or kuch varshon ke bheetar yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki gyaat pulsar, teji se chakrit neutron taare hi hai
 By that time, neutron stars were also confined to theoretical curiosity only
 isliye pulsar kii khoj ne un sabhi ati ghanatv vaali vastuon ke prati ruchi ko jaagrit kiya jinaki sanrachana gurutveey patan se hona sambhav hua hoga
 Physicist John Wheeler is widely credited with coining the term black hole in his public speech Our Universe: Known and Unknown in 1967, more cumulatively as an alternative to the "star that has gravitationally fallen to full collapse"
 in the form of
 haalanki, whealer ne jor diya tha ki sammelan main yah shabd kisi or ne gadha tha or unhone isko keval ek upyogi laghu-shabd ke rup main apanaaya
 The term was also cited in a letter to AAAS by Anne Ewing in 1964: jab kisi bade taare kaa puraa kaa puraa eendhan jal jaataa he to usamen ek jabardast visphot hota he jise supernova kehete hai
 The substance that survives after the explosion slowly starts to shrink and takes the form of a very dense mass called a neutron star
 agar neutron star bahut vishaal he to gurutvkarshan kaa dabaav itnaa hoga ki vah apane hi boj se simatata chalaa jayega or itnaa ghanaa ho jayega ki blike hole ban jayega or shyaam vivar, krishna gart yaa blike hole ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 The No Hair Theorem states that, once established, a black hole has only three independent physical characteristics: mass, charge, and angular momentum
 kinhin do blike hole kii in visheshtaon yaa parameter kii value yadi samaan ho to unke bich bhed karnaa kaaphi dushkar ho jaataa he
 These characteristics are special because they are visible from outside the black hole
 udhaaharan ke liye, anya kisi chargekrit vastu kii hi tarah ek chargekrit blike hole bhi samaan charge ko dur dhakelta he, is tathy ke baavjood bhi ki vidyut or chumbakeey balon ke liye jimmedaar kan photauns, aatanrik kshetra se bachakar nikal nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is the Gauss law, the total electric current exiting a large sphere is always the same and measures the total charge within the sphere
 jab charge blike hole main girtaa he, vidyut kshetra line bani rahati hai or kshitij se baahar kii or jhaankati rahati hai or ye kshetra line girane vaale sabhi padaarthon ke kul charge ko sangrakshit karti hai
 Electric field lines eventually spread uniformly across the surface of the black hole, establishing uniform field line density on the surface
 is sandarbh main blike hole ek aam condkating sphier kii tarah kaam karata he jisaki ek nishchit rasistivity hoti he
 Similarly, the total mass of a sphere containing a black hole can be found using the gravitational analog of the Gauss law, sitting far away from the black hole
 isi tarah, koniya gati ko bahut dur se, guruttviya-chumbakeey kshetra dwaara frem dreging kaa upyog karke mapa ja saktaa he
 When a black hole swallows a substance, its horizon oscillates like a wide membrane with friction, a transient system, until it is finally established
 yah vidyut-chumbakatv yaa gej siddhant jaise anya kshetra siddhant se alag he, jinamein kabhi bhi koi gharshan yaa rasistivity nahin hoti kyonki ve samay palatwaan hote hai
 Because a black hole eventually sets up in a final state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: very little about the gravity and electric field of the black hole
 Be able to provide information lupt jaankaree main ve sabhi chijen shaamil hai jinhen blike hole kshitij se bahut duuri se mapa nahin ja saktaa he, jaise kii, kul beryon number, laptone number, tathaa kan bhautikee ke lagbhag sabhi anya sangrakshit sudo-charge
 From here on, this behavior is so strange that it has been called the 'black hole information loss paradox'
 paaramparik rup se bhi blike hole main jaankaree kaa lupt hona kaaphi ajeeb he, kyonki saamaanya saapekshata ek lagrengian siddhant he jo upar upar se time reversible or hamiltonian prathit hota he
 But the black hole is not reversible due to the horizon: matter can penetrate into it but cannot escape
 ek aam blike hole main samay ke palatney ko white hole kaha gaya he, haalaanki entropy or kwantum makenix yah darshaate hai ki white hole blike hole ke samaan hi hai
 The no-hair theorem makes some assumptions about the nature of our universe and the substances involved, while other assumptions provide different conclusions
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi chumbakeey ekal-dhruvon kaa astitv he, jaisaa ki kuch siddhanton dwaara kaha gaya he, chumbakeey charge ek parmparik blike hole kaa chauthaa maapdand hoga
 Examples of the no-hair theorem are known for the following cases: ye apwaad kabhi kabhi asthir hote hai or kabhi kabhi blike hole se dur nai sangrakshit kwantum sankhyaon tak nahin le jate hai
 This theorem must apply in our four-dimensional and almost flat universe
 saralatam blike hole vah he jiskaa drabyaman he lekin na to charge he or na hi koniya gati
 These black holes are also known as Schwarzschild black holes, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1915
 yah oinstin kshetra sameekaran ke liye khoja jane vaala pehla vishwasaneey or sateek samaadhaan tha or birkhophf prameya ke anusaar yah ekmaatr nirvaat samaadhaan he jo spherickli cymetric he
 This means that there is no visible difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and the gravitational field of any other spherical object of equal mass
 blike hole ke liye yah lokapriy dharna kii yah apane chaaron ore "prayek vastu ko andar khinchataa rahata he" keval iske kshitij ke paas hi satya baithti he; duuri par, iskaa bahari gurutvkarshan kshetra anivaary rup se saadhaaran baari pindon kii tarah kaa hi hota he
 More common solutions to black holes were discovered in the late 20th century
 reissner-nordastrom metric vidyut charge vaale blike hole kaa varnan karata he, jabaki kerr metric ek chakrit blike hole pradaan karata he
 The Kerr – Newman metric is generally the more prevalent stationary black hole solution, which describes both charge and angular momentum
 haalanki ek blike hole kaa dravyaman koi bhi positive mulya le saktaa he, charge or koniya gati dravyaman dwaara baadhya hote hai
 In natural units, the total charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} and the total angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} are expected to satisfy the following m dravyaman vaale ek blike hole ke liye
 The black hole that fills this disparity is called extreme
 asamanta kaa ulanghan karne vaale oinstin ke samikarnon ke samaadhaanon kaa astitv he, lekin unamem kshitij nahin he
 These solutions have naked specificity and are considered immaterial, because the cosmic censorship hypothesis rejects this specificity because of the overall gravitational collapse of real substances
 yah sankhyatmak anukritiyon dwaara samarthit he
 Due to the relatively large force of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed by the collapse of stars are expected to retain the neutral charge of the stars
 chakran ko compact vastuon kaa ek saamaanya gun mana gaya he or aisa prathit hota he ki blike hole ke pratyaashee binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 kii koniya gati apane adhiktam sambhav value ke kareeb he
 Black holes are generally classified according to their mass, independent of the angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,}
 The size of a black hole determined by the event horizon radius, or the Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass m { \ displaystyle m \ ,}, jahaan r s h { \ displaystyle r_{sh} \ ,} schvarjaschild trigya he or m ⨀ { \ displaystyle M_{ \ bigodot }} surya kaa dravyaman he
 Thus the size and mass of a black hole are simply related, independent of rotation
 is kasuti ke anusaar, blike holon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: The characteristic of a black hole is the appearance of the event horizon; a space of time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer
 jaisaa ki saamaanya saapekshata ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi, dravyaman kii upasthiti antariksh-samay ko is prakaar vikrut kar detii he ki kanon ke maarg unhen us dravyaman kii taraf le jate hai
 This deformation becomes so powerful on the incident horizon of the black hole that there is no way to go out
 ek baar koi kan ghatana kshitij ke andar aa jaye, uskaa blike hole ke bheetar janaa avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 For a spectator standing far away, the clocks near the black hole would seem to move more slowly
 is prabhaav ke kaaran, dur khadaa darshak yah dekhegaa ki blike hole main girane vaali koi vastu uske ghatana kshitij ke nikat aane par dhimi ho jaati he, us tak pahunchne ke liye anant samay leti hui prathit hoti he
 At the same time all the actions of this object slow down, resulting in the light appearing more red and dim, this effect is called gravitational red shift
 ant main, girane vaali vastu itani maddham ho jaati he ki dikhaai dena band ho jaati he, ek bindu par ghatana kshitij par pahunchne se thik pehle
 The Schwarzschild radius limits non-spherical event horizons for non-rotating black holes
 ek vastu kii schvarjaschild trigya dravyaman ke anupaat main hoti he
 Circled black holes have a distorted, nonspherical event horizon
 chunki ghatana kshitij ek bhautik sataha nahin he balki keval ek ganitiya paribhaashit seemaa he, padaarth yaa vikiran ko blike hole main pravesh karne se rokane vaala kuch bhi nahin he, keval baahar nikalne se inako roka jaataa he
 The description given by general relativity for black holes is an approximation and it is expected that quantum gravity effects become important from near the event horizon
 yah, blike hole ke ghatana kshitij ke nikat padaarth ke prekshan ko, saamaanya saapekshata or uske prastaavit vistaaron ke adhyayan ko sambhav banaata he
 Although black holes themselves do not radiate energy, electromagnetic radiation and matter particles can radiate from outside the event horizon, via Hawking radiation
 singhulerity blike hole ke centre main hoti he, jahaan padaarth main dabane ke kaaran anant ghanatv ho jaataa he, gurutvkarshan khinchaav anant shaktishaalee hota he or antariksh-samay main anant vikruti hoti he
 This means the mass of a black hole is completely compressed into a region with zero volume
 blike hole ke centre main is shunya-aaytan, anant rup se saghan kshetra ko gurutveey singhulerity kaha jaataa he
 The singularity of a non-rotating black hole is zero in length, width, and height; The singularity of a rotating black hole is ring-shaped and is located on the plane of rotation
 challe main koi motaai nahin hoti isliye koi aaytan nahin hota
 The presence of singularity in general relativity is generally considered an indication of the principle not being applied
 haalaanki yah apekshit he; yah aisi paristhiti main ghatit hota he jahaan kwantum yantric prabhaavon ko inkaa varnan karnaa chahie tha, ati ucch ghanatv or kan sahabhaagitaaon ke kaaran
 Until now it has not been possible to combine the effects of quantum and gravity in one theory
 aam taur par ummid kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv ke siddhant main singulerity rahit blike hole honge
 The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness where the photons will be trapped in a circular orbit, moving along the tangent of the sphere
 anavarti blike hole ke liye, photone sphere kii trigya schvarjaschild trigya kii 1
5 guna hoti he
 These orbits are dynamically unstable, so any small disturbance will also grow larger over time and either throw it beyond the black hole or push it within the event horizon
 haalaanki prakaash abhi bhi photone sphere ke andar se batch saktaa he, koi prakaash jo andar kii or jaati prakshepan path se photone kshetra ko paar karti he us par blike hole kaa kabja ho jaayegaa
 Therefore any light that reaches an audience standing outside from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by an object outside the photon sphere but beyond the event horizon
 neutron taron jaisi anya compact vastuon main bhi photone sphere ho sakate hai
 This is based on the fact that the gravitational field of an object does not depend on its actual size, so an object that is smaller than 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius would actually have a photon sphere corresponding to the object's mass
 chakrit blike hole chaaron taraf se argosphior namak ek antariksh-samay kshetra se ghira hota he jisamen sthir khada hona asambhav he
 This is the result of a process called frame-dragging; General relativity predicts that any rotating mass will try to stretch the space-time around itself
 chakrit drabyaman ke paas kii koi bhi vastu chakra kii disha main ghoomana shuru kar degi
 For a rotating black hole, its impact becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction just to stand still
 ek blike hole kaa argosphior nimnlikhit se ghira hota he: Within the ergosphere, space-time is drawn at a greater speed than light - in general relativity physical objects are forbidden to move faster than light, but space-time zones allow them to be compared to other space-time regions i can walk faster than light
 vasteen or vikiran, centre main gire bina argosphior ke bheetar kaksha main rah sakati hai
 But they cannot hover, because this would require them to travel faster than light backwards, compared to their own space-time zone, which is moving faster than light compared to an outside viewer
 vasteen or vikiran bhi argosphior se batch kar nikal sakate hai
 In fact, the Penrose process predicts that objects will sometimes fly out of the agosphere, for this they will gain energy by "stealing" some of the black hole's energy
 agar vastuon ke kul drabyaman kaa bada bhaag is tarah batch nikalataa he, blike hole kii ghoomane kii gati or dhimi pad jaayegi or antat shaayad ghoomana band bhi ho jaye | The fascinating image of the black hole is bound to raise the question of whether such bizarre objects actually exist, or are they merely imaginary solutions to the Einstein equations
 oinstin kii swayan kr yah galat dharna thi ki blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he, kyonki unka vishwaas tha ki patan kii ore agrasar kanon kii koniya gati unki chaal ko sthirataa pradaan karegi
 Because of this, the general relativity community continued to dismiss its opposing results for many years
 lekin unamem se kuch is vishwaas par kaayam rahe ki blike hole kaa astitv vastav main he, or 1960 ke dashak ke ant tak ve adhikansh shodhakartaaon ko yah vishwaas dilaane main safal rahe ki ghatana kshitij kaa nirmaan vaaki main sambhav he
 Once upon a time, Roger Penrose proved that there must be some form of syngularity within him
 iske kuch hi samay pashchaat, stephen hawking ne yah darshaya ki big baing ke kai brahmadia samaadhaanon main singulerity kaa astitv he, scaler kshetron or anya videshi padaarthon kii anupasthiti main 
 The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical characteristics of a black hole are simple and easily understandable, making them respected research subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki blike holon ke nirmaan kii praathmik prakriya taron jaisi baari vastuon kaa guruttviya patan rahi hogi, lekin kai anya prakriyaayein bhi hai jo blike hole ke nirmaan kii taraf le ja sakati hai
 Gravitational collapse occurs when the internal pressure of an object is insufficient to resist its own gravity
 taron main yah aamtaur par isliye hota he kyonki yaa to taron main apane taapmaana ko banaae rakhane ke liye "eendhan" aparyaapt he, yaa ek tara jo sthir tha use dher saare atirikt padaarth mili parantu uske crod kaa taapmaana nahin badhaa
 In both cases, star temperature would prove insufficient to prevent its collapse under its own weight
 is patan ko taare ke ghatakon ke aapjatya dabaav dwaara roka ja saktaa he, padaarth ek aakarshak ghani avasthaa main sanghanit ho jaataa he
 The result is a type of compact star
 What type of compact star will form will depend on the mass of the residue - the residuals have decimated the outer surfaces after the changes caused by the collapse
 note karen ki yah mul taare se kaaphi kam hoga- 5 se adhik saura drabyaman vaale avasheshon kaa utpaadan aise taron se hota he jinka dravyaman patan se pehle 20 se adhik rahaa hoga
 If the mass of the residue exceeds ~ 3-4 solar masses - because the original star was either too heavy or the residue has collected additional mass) - the neutron's inelastic pressure is also insufficient to prevent collapse
 iske baad aisi koi gyaat prakriya nahin he jo is patan ko roak sake or vastu patit ho kar blike hole main tabdeel ho jaayegi
 This gravitational collapse of heavy stars is attributed to the formation of most stellar mass black holes
 gurutveey patan ke liye bahut adhik ghanatv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the current age of the universe, this high density is found only in stars, but in the early universe the density was much higher soon after the Big Bang, which may have made the creation of black holes possible
 ucch ghanatv akele ek blike hole ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt nahin he kyonki drabyaman kaa samaan vitaran, drabyaman ko ikattha hone kii anumati nahin degaa
 For the formation of ancient black holes in this dense medium, it is necessary to have initial cubic disturbances that can later grow under the influence of their own gravity
 praarambhik brahmad ke vibhinn modelon main in gadbadiyon ke aakaar ke bare main vyapak matbhed he
 Various models predicted the creation of black holes, ranging from Planck masses to hundreds of thousands of solar masses
 atah aadim blike hole kisi bhi prakaar ke blike hole ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakate hai
 Gravitational collapse is not the only process that can create a black hole
 siddhant rup main, blike hole kaa nirmaan ucch urja takkaron main bhi sambhav he jo paryaapt ghanatv paidaa karti hai
 However, so far, no such phenomenon has been detected, either directly or indirectly, as a lack of oscillating equilibrium in particle accelerator experiments
 iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki blike hole ke dravyaman ke liye ek nichali seemaa honi chahie
 Theoretically, this limit should be around the Planck mass, where it is expected that quantum effects would prove the theory of general relativity to be false
 is kaaran prithvi yaa uske aas paas blike hole ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko bilkul nakaara ja saktaa he
 However, some developments in quantum gravity suggest that the limit of this bond may be considerably lower
 udahaaran ke liye, kuch brinworld paridrishy plank dravyaman ko kaaphi neeche rakhte hai, shaayad 1 tev / c2 itnaa neeche tak
 This may allow the creation of microscopic black holes in high-energy collisions or large Hadron colliders of the CERN
 haalaanki ye saare siddhant kaaphi kaalpanik hai or kai vaigyaniko kaa mat he ki in prakriyaaon main blike hole kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he
 Black holes, once formed, continue to develop by absorption of additional substances
 saare blike hole antartaarkeey dhul or sarvyaapee vikiran ko lagaataar avashoshit karte rahenge, lekin inamen se kisi bhi prakriya kaa ek taarakeey blike hole ke dravyaman par koi khaas prabhaav nahin padataa he
 More significant contributions occur when a black hole is formed in a binary star system
 nirmaan ke baad blike hole apane saathi se kaaphi maatra main padaarth avashoshit kar saktaa he
 Extremely large contributions occur when a black hole merges with other stars or compact objects
 adhikansh akashgangaon ke centre main sthit ati vishalkay blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhawatah kai choti vastuon ke vilay ke dwaara hua hoga
 The same process has also been proposed to form some intermediate-mass black holes
 jaise jaise ek vastu ghatana kshitij kii taraf babbti he, kshitij phoolnaa aarambh kar detaa he or lapak kar usko nigal letaa he
 Shortly thereafter, the expansion of the radius is evenly distributed throughout the hole
 1974 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki blike hole puri tarah se kaale nahin hai, balki ye thodi maatra main tapiya vikiran bhi nikaalte hai
 They found this result using quantum field theory in a stable black hole background
 unke samikarnon kaa parinaam yah he ki ek blike hole ko kanon ko ek adarsh blike body spectrum main chhodana chahie
 This effect became known as Hawking radiation
 hawking parinaam ke baad se, kaiyon nen vibhinn tareekon ke madhyam se is prabhaav ko satyapit kiya he
 If this theory of black hole radiation is correct, then it is expected that the black holes will remove the thermal beam of radiation and this will cause the mass to decay, since according to the theory of relativity, the mass is just the high condensed energy
 Over time, black holes will shrink and fly in the air
 is kiranpunj kaa taapmaana blike hole ke satahi gurutvkarshanake anupatik rahata he, jo badale main dravyaman ke liye vipareet rup main anupaatik rahata he
 Hence larger black holes emit less radiation than smaller black holes
 5 saura drabyaman vaale ek taarakeey blike hole kaa hawking taapmaana kareeb 12 nanokelvins hota he
 This is much lower than the 2
7K produced by the space micro-wave background
 taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike hole hawking vikiran ke madhyam se jitna drabyaman chhodte hai usase adhik dravyaman ve cosmik microwave prishthbhumi se praapt kar lete hai, atah ve sikudne kii bajaay failte jate hai
 To achieve Hawking temperatures higher than 2
7 K, a black hole would have to be lighter than the Moon
 duusari taraf yadi ek blike hole bahut chota he, ummid kii jaati he ki uskaa vikiran kaa prabhaav bahut shaktishaalee ho jaayegaa
 a black hole that is even heavier than humans will vanish in a moment
 ek car ke vajan vaala blike hole ko vashpit hone ke liye maatr ek nanosecond kaa samay hi lagegaa, is dauraan kuch kshanon ke liye isaki chamak surya se 200 guna se bhi adhik ho jaayegi
 Light black holes are expected to evaporate even faster, for example a black hole with 1 tev / c 2 mass will take less than 10–88 seconds to completely disappear
 beshak, itane chote blike hole ke liye kwantum gurutv prabhaav se ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii ummid kii jaati he or yahan tak ki – haalaanki kwantum gurutv main hue haal ke vikaas is ore koi sanket nahin karte hai – parikaalpanik taur par aise chote blike hole sthir honge
 The presence of most accretion disks and gas jets is not a clear evidence of the presence of stellar mass black holes, as other more massless and very dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can cause and create accretion disks and gas currents
 The behavior is the same as that around a black hole
 lekin ve aksar khagolavidon kii yah batalaakar madad kar sakati hai ki kis jagah blike hole kii talash faldaayi siddh ho sakati he
 But on the other hand, supermassive accretion disks and gas currents can be a good proof of the presence of a highly soluble black hole, because as far as we know, only one black hole can be the cause of these phenomena
 sthir eks-re or gamma kiran utsarjan bhi kisi blike hole kii maujuudagi sabit nahin karte hai, lekin khagolavidon ko yah bataa sakate hai ki kahan khoj karnaa faldaayi hoga- or inaki ye khubi hoti he ki ve kaaphi aasaani se nabulai or gas ke badalon se nikal pate hai
 But powerful, irregular X-rays, gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiation can help prove that that massive, super-dense object is not a black hole, so that the "black hole hunter" is focused on another object Can do
 neutron taron or anya ati saghan taron par satahen hoti hai or padaarthon kaa prakaash kii gati ke ek ucch pratishat par sataha ke saath takaraav, aniyamit antaraalon par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa utsarjan karata he
 The black hole has no solid surface, so the absence of intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals around a very densely compact object indicates that there may be a good chance of a black hole
 gahan parantu ek hi baar gamma kiran kaa nikalnaa kisi "nae" blike hole ke janm kaa sanket ho saktaa he, kyonki khagol-bhautikavidon kaa vichaar he ki grbs kaa kaaran yaa to kisi vishaal taare kaa gurutveey patan he athwa neutron taron ke bich takaraav, or in donon ghatnaon main blike hole kaa srijan karne hetu paryaapt drabyaman or dabaav shaamil hota he
 But it appears that a collision between a neutron star and a black hole can also produce a GRB, so a GRB is not evidence that a "new" black hole has formed
 sabhi gyaat GRB hamaari apni akashganga ke baahar se aate hai or adhikansh arabon prakaash varshon kii dur se aate hai isliye inase jude blike hole vastav main arabon varsh puraane hai
 Some space-physicists believe that some super bright X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black holes
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kasaar atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii abhivruddhi discs hai, kyonki ab tak gyaat koi bhi vastu itani shaktishaalee nahin he jo itnaa shaktishaalee utsarzan kar sake
 Quasars produce powerful emissions throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, including UV, X-rays and gamma-rays, and are also visible from a considerable distance due to their high brightness
 5 se 25 pratishat ke bich kasaar "radio laud" hote hai, yah sangya inke shaktishaalee radio utsarjan ke kaaran he
 a gravitational lens is formed when rays of light coming from a far away bright source are "twisted" around a giant object, between the viewer and the source object
 This process is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of general relativity theory
 is siddhant ke anusaar, drabyaman gurutvkarshan kshetron ko banane ke liye antariksh-samay ko "samete" rahata he or isliye parinamswaroop prakaash ko mode detaa he
 The image of the source behind the lens can appear to an observer as multiple images
 yadi strot, baari lencing vastu or paryvekshak ek sidhi rekha main hon, strot baari vastu ke peeche ek challe ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 Gravitational lensing can also be caused by objects other than black holes, because any very powerful gravitational field has the ability to bend light rays
 in bahu chhaviyon vaale prabhaavon main se kuch, sambhawatah sudur sthit akashgangaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Objects orbiting a black hole continue to explore the gravitational field surrounding the central object
 1970 ke dashak main khoja gaya, ek purana udhaaharan he, ek prasiddh eksre strot signs X-1 ke liye jimmedaar kalpit blike hole ke ird-gird parikrama karti abhivruddhi discs
 Although the matter itself cannot be seen directly, the flickering of the x-ray continues in milliseconds, as expected just before accretion from a hot mass-like material orbiting around a black hole of about ten solar masses
 Is performed

 Another example is the S2 star which is seen orbiting the celestial center
 yah tara ~ 3
5 × 106 saura drabyaman vaale blike hole se kai prakaash ghanton kii duuri par he, isliye isaki parikraman gati ko ankit kiya ja saktaa he
 Nothing is visible in the center of the supervised orbit, as would be expected from a black object
 ardh-aavadhik dolan kaa istamaal blike hole ke dravyaman kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique uses the relationship between the black hole and the inner part of its surrounding disks, where the gas continues to rotate inward before reaching the event horizon
 jaise hi gas kaa patan bheetar kii ore hota he, yah eksre vikiran prasaarit karata he jisaki tivrata ek nishchit kram se kam-zyada hoti rahati he or jo ek niyamit antaraal par khud ko doharaata rahata he
 This indicator is called half-period oscillation or QPO
 ek QPO kii aavriti blike hole ke dravyaman par nirbhar karti he; chote blike hole main ghatana kshitij nikat hi sthit hota he, isliye QPO kii aavriti ucch hoti he
 For black holes with greater mass, the event horizon is farther outward, so the QPO frequency is lower
 ab yah vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek akashganga ke, yaa lagbhag prayek, centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole hota he
 The close correlation between the mass of this black hole and the rise of the host galaxy indicates that there is a deep correlation between the formation of the galaxy and the black hole
 dashakon tak, khagolavidon ne "sakriy akashganga" shabd kaa istemaal aisi akashgangaon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jinamein asaamaanya visheshtaayen hoti thi, jaise ki asaamaanya varnakrameey rekha utsarjan or ati shaktishaalee radio utsarjan
 However, theoretical and observational studies show that the galactic nuclei active in these galaxies may contain supermassive black holes
 in AGN ke modelon main ek kendriya blike hole hota he jo ki suraj se lakhon yaa arabon guna adhik baari ho saktaa he; ek gas or dhul kii discs jise abhivruddhi discs kehete hai; or do dharaaen jo abhivruddhi discs ke lambavat hoti hai
 Although it is expected that supermassive black holes will be found in almost all agns, the nuclei of only a few galaxies have been carefully studied in an effort to both identify and measure the actual mass of central supermassive black hole candidates
 Can be done
 aisi kuch ullekhneey akashgangaon ke udhaaharan hai, andromeda akashganga, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, or sombrero akashganga
 Astronomers believe that a supermassive black hole is located in the center of our own galaxy, in an area called Segitarius a *, because: 2002 main, habbal antarikshawya doorabeen ne jo avlokan prastut kiya ve sanket karte hai ki M15 or G1 naamak golakaar samoohon main madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole ke hone kii sambhaavna he
 This interpretation is based on the size and duration of the orbit of stars in spherical clusters
 lekin habbal saboot nirnaayak nahin he, kyonki neutron taron kaa ek samooh is tarah ke avlokanon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Until recent discoveries, many astronomers thought that complex gravitational interactions in spherical clusters would expel newly formed black holes
 november 2004 main, khagolavidon kii ek team ne hamaari akashganga ke pratham or purnatah satyapit madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, jo segiterius A* se 3 prakaash varsh dur parikrama kar rahaa he
 This black hole, with a mass of 1300 solar masses, is in the middle of a group of seven stars, possibly a remnant of a massive star cluster that has fallen from the center of the Ganges
 yah avlokan is baat kii pushti karata he ki ati vishalkay blike hole aasapaas ke chote blike holon or taron ke avasorana dwaara apni vruddhi karte he
 In January 2007, researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom reported the discovery of a black hole, possibly containing 10 solar masses and located in a galaxy called NGC 4472, at a distance of about 55 million light years
 hamaari akashganga main kai sambhavit taarakeey-dravyaman vaale blike hole shaamil hai, jo sagiterius A* kshetra ke ati vishalkay blike hole kii tulana main hamase adhik najadik hai
 All of these candidates are members of X-ray binary systems in which a more dense object draws substances from its partner through an accretion disk
 in jodon main blike hole teen se lekar ek darjan se zyada saura dravyamanon ke ho sakate hai
 The hitherto observable stellar mass black hole, Messia is a member of the binary system located in 33 galaxies
 siddhanthata ek blike hole ke liye koi nunatam aakaar tay nahin he
 Once they are created, they have the properties of black holes
 stephen hawking ne pratipaadit kiya ki atipraarambhik blike hole vashpit ho kar or bhi sookshm ho sakate hai, arthath sookshm blike hole
 The Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope is being proposed for the discovery of a supermassive black hole that evaporates, which was launched on 11 June 2008
 haalaanki, agar sookshm blike hole kaa nirmaan duusare tareekon se ho saktaa he, jaise ki antarikshawya kiran ke prabhaav se yaa coliders main, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhen nishchit rup se vashpit ho janaa chahie
 The formation of analogs of black holes in particle accelerators on Earth is reported
 ye blike hole anuroop gurutveey blike hole ke samaan nahin hote hai, lekin gurutv pramaatra siddhanton kii jaanch ke liye ye mahatvapurn hai
 They behave like black holes, which have nothing to do with gravity and the quantum theory of gravity, in line with the theory of strong nuclear power
 ve samaan hai kyonki donon string siddhant dwaara varnit kiye jate hai
 Therefore, the formation and dissolution of fire spheres in quark gluons plasma can be explained in the language of black holes

 For a more in-depth discussion, see: Particle collision protection in the Large Hadron Collider
 saamaanya saapekshata main aise vinyas kii sambhaavna kaa varnan kiya gaya he jisamen do blike hole ek duusare se jude hue hai
 Such a configuration is usually called a wormhole
 varmholon ne kalpit vigyaan kathaon ke lekhakon ko prerit kiya he kyonki ve ati lambi duuri kii yatraaon ko shighrata se tay karne kaa saadhan pradaan karte hai, time travel bhi
 In practice, such configurations are almost impossible in astrophysics, as no known process seems to allow the creation of these objects
 1971 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki paaramparik blike hole ke kisi bhi sangrah ke ghatana kshitij ke kul kshetra ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi ve aapas main takaraa kar ek duusare ko nigal len, arthath vilay ho jaae
 This is remarkably similar to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, where the field plays the role of entropy
 aisa mana jaataa tha ki shunya taapmaana hone kii vajah se blike hole kii entropy shunya hogi
 If this were the case, the entry of entropy-rich matter into the black hole would have violated the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe
 isliye, jacob bekensten ne prastaav rakhaa ki ek blike hole kii ek entropy chahie or ise ghatana kshitij kaa anupaatik hona chahie
 Since black holes traditionally do not emit radiation, the thermodynamic approach seems to be consistent, as zero temperature means infinite changes in entropy by any sum of heat, which means infinite entropy
 haalaanki, 1974 main, hawking ne ghatana kshitij ke paas pramaatra kshetra siddhant ko vakrit antariksh-samay par lagu kiya or paaya ki blike hole hawking vikiran chhodte hai, jo ek tarah kaa tapiya vikiran he or unru prabhaav se sambaddh he, jiskaa arth yah niklaa ki unamem ek saakaratmak taapmaana nihit he
 This reinforced the simulation between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics: using the first law of black hole mechanics, it can be concluded that the entropy of a non-rotating black hole will be one-fourth of the area of its event horizon 
 yah ek saarvbhaumik parinaam he or ise sampoorn brahmadia kshitij par lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii di citter antariksh kshetra main
 Later it was suggested that a black hole is an object with maximum entropy, that is, the maximum possible entropy of a single region of space would be the entropy of the largest black hole that can be contained in that region
 isaki vajah se holographic siddhant kii utpatti hui
 Hawking radiation refers to the specific temperature of a black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy
 taapmaana jitna giregaa, blike hole utana hi vishaal hota jaayegaa: jitani adhik urja avashoshit karegaa, utana hi adhik adhik thanda hota jaayegaa
 a black hole with approximately the mass of the planet Mercury has a temperature in equilibrium with celestial micro-wave radiation
 isse adhik baari hone par, ek blike hole prishthbhumi vikiran se adhik thanda ho jayega or yah hawking vikiran ke madhyam se utsarjit urja kii tulana main, prishthbhumi se zyada teji se urja praapt karegaa, isse bhi adhik thanda ho jaayegaa
 However, in a less massive black hole this effect would indicate that the mass of the black hole evaporates slowly over time, while the black hole will continue to heat up while doing so
 haalaanki ye prabhaav un blike hole ke liye naganya hai jo antarikshawya rup se gathit hone ke liye paryaapt rup se baari hai, ve kaalpanik chote blike hole ke liye badi teji se mahatvapurn ho jaayenge, jahaan pramaatra-yantric prabhaav haaavee hon
 In fact, small black holes will probably evaporate at a rapid rate and eventually disappear with an explosion of radiation
 haalanki saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog kisi blike hole kii entropy kii gananaa hetu kiya ja saktaa he, yah sthiti siddhanthata santushti dene vaala nahin he
 In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as the calculation of the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have similar microscopic properties
 lekin ek pramaatra gurutv ke santoshjanak siddhant ke bina, blike hole ke liye is prakaar kii gananaa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 However, little hope has been aroused by string theory, according to which the microscopic amount of freedom of a black hole is D-branes
 pradaan kiye gayi charge or urja dwaara di-brans kii avasthaaon kii gananaa karke, kuch khaas ati samamit blike hole ke utkram maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Extending the field of validity of these calculations is an ongoing area of research
 tathakthith jaankaree lop virodhabhas, yaa blike hole kendrikaran virodhabhas, moulik bhautikee main ek khulaa prashn he
 Traditionally, the laws of physics will remain the same, move forward or backward
 arthath, yadi brahmad ke prayek kan kii sthiti or veg kii maap kii jaye, to ham icchaanusaar ateet ke brahmad ke itihaas kii khoj ke liye peeche kii taraf kaam kar sakate hai
 The Louville theorem describes the conservation of the phase space volume, which can be understood as "conservation of information", so there is a problem in established physics as well
 kwantum yantriki main, yah kendrikaran naamak ek mahatvapurn gun ke saath mail khaati he, jiskaa sambandh prayikta ke sangrakshan ke saath he 
 However, black holes can violate this rule
 sthapit saamaanya saapekshata ke antargat yah sthiti sookshm kintu spasht he: sthapit no-hair prameya ke kaaran, yah kabhi nirdhaarit nahin kiya ja saktaa ki blike hole ke andar kya gaya? haalaanki, baahar se dekhne par, jaankaree vastav main kabhi nasht nahin hoti he, kyonki blike hole main girte hue padaarth ko ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne main anant samay lagata he
 It is necessary to emphasize that the equations of general relativity do in fact follow t-symmetry and that the fact that the above argument comes from the application of general relativity should be a bit cautious
 yah is tathy kii vajah se he ki time-cymetric siddhant dwaara time-reversal-acemmetric nishkarsh tak pahunchaana sambhav nahin he, jo is maamle main saamaanya saapekshata he
 Rindler coordinates, which are applied near the event horizon for an external viewer, are T-symmetric, so the existence of something like an "invariant" process can be ruled out
 yah sambhav he ki "virodhabhas" time-samamit siddhant par time-asamamit seemaa ko lagu karne kaa parinaam he, yah isko loshmit virodhabhas kaa ek prakaar banataa he
 Considerations of quantum gravity, on the other hand, suggest that there may only be a finite finite inverse measurement that will be related to the space near the horizon: but the change in the horizon's entropy and the Hawking radiation's entropy measure are sufficient Happens to contain all the transverse measurements of matter and energy that are falling into a black hole
 haalaanki kai bhautikeevidon kii yah chintaa he ki yah abhi bhi thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he
 In particular, at a quantum level, the quantum state of Hawking radiation is determined only by what has previously fallen into the black hole; And the history of what had fallen into a black hole is determined solely by the quantum state of black hole and radiation
 yahi niyatatvvaad or kendrikaran kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 For a long time Stephen Hawking defied the idea, insisting on his original 1975 position that Hawking radiation is completely thermal, therefore completely disorganized, with no information of the material previously ingested by the black hole
 ; He argued that this information has been omitted
 haalaanki, 21 july 2004 main, unhone nayaa tark prastut kiya, apane pichley tark ke vipareet
 In this new calculation, the entropy measurement corresponding to the black hole passes out to the Hawking radiation
 haalaanki, ise siddhant main samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he, jab tak blike hole apana vashpikaran puraa na kar le
 Until then, it is impossible to establish a 1: 1 approach to Hawking radiation information and the initial state of the system
 ek baar jab blike hole puri tarah vashpit ho jaye, unki pahchaan kii ja sakati he or unamem hua kendrikaran sangrakshit rahata he
 By the time Hawking completed his calculations, it was quite clear by the ads / CFT relationship that black holes decay in a unitary way
 kyonki gej siddhanton main aag ke gole, jo hawking vikiran ke anuroop hai, nishchit rup se ekaatmak hai
 Hawking's new calculations have not been evaluated by the expert scientific community, because their methods are unintentional and of questionable conformity
 lekin khud hawking ne isapar paryaapt vishwaas jataate hue 1997 main caltech bhautikavid jon preskill ke saath lagaai gayi shart ke liye bhugtan kiya, jisamen media ko kaaphi ruchi rahi thi
 Leonard Saskind and Nobel Prize winner Gerard t Huft have suggested that the three-dimensional space around the black hole can be fully characterized by a two-dimensional behavior of the event horizon
 ve isapar vishwaas karte hai kyonki yah blike hole jaankaree-lop virodhabhas kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he
 This idea has been adapted under string theory, and is known as holographic theory

 It was the duty of any samurai to die before his king
 agar koi raja maaraa jaataa to saamuraai kaa farz tha ke uske maarane waalon se badla le
 The situation of the master of the samurai who had died or who had expelled him from his service for some reason was considered extremely shameful and he was never again served by a king

 Biogas or biogas is a gas mixture produced by the dissolution of organic material in the absence of oxygen
 yah saura urja or pawan urja kii tarah hi navikarniya urja strot he
 Biogas can be produced from locally available raw materials and waste

 Biogas can be made from fossil fuels or from dead biomass
 byogas adhikanshat: jeevashm eendhanon se adhik pasand kiya jaataa he
 a small amount of carbon is healthy for the environment, but when excess it becomes irritating
 jeevashm eendhanon main carbon itane samay se maujuud he ki vah ab carbon cycle kaa hissaa hi nahin rah gai
 Carbon levels increase when fossil fuels burn
 byogas haalia mrit organism se banataa he, isliye yah vaataavaran main carbon str ko nahin bigaadti
 Biogas is also better than fossil fuel because it is cheaper and renewable energy

 Biofuel is made from dead organic elements called biomass and can be in liquid, gaseous or solid form
 ek byogas plant main ek digester or gas holder hota he jo eendhan nirmaan karata he
 The digester of the plant is airtight in which waste material is added and gas is stored in the gas holder

 byogas plant jameen kii sataha yaa uske neeche banaaya jaataa he or donon modelon ke apane phaayde-nuksaan hai
 The plant on the surface is easy to maintain and also benefits from the heat of the sun, but more attention has to be paid to its construction as there is attention to the internal pressure of the digester
 iske vipareet sataha ke neeche sthit plant nirmaan main aasaan lekin rakh-rakhaav main mushkil hota he
 India has the largest number of cattle in the world, so there is a huge potential for the development of biogas
 byogas maweshiyon ke utsarjan padaarthon ko kam taap par digester main chalaakar microb utpann karke praapt kii jaati he
 Bio-gas contains 75 percent methane gas which burns without producing smoke

 Drying the bio gas slurry directly or under shade or by making vermicompost should be used in the fields as compost
 baio gas se aajkal dijal pump set bhi chalaa sakate he jisase dijal evam anya urja ki bachat hoti he
 In the biogas plant, after digestion of cow dung, 25% solids are converted into gas and 75% solids are converted to manure
 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he
 It is a very good manure for farming, it contains nitrogen 1
5 to 2% phosphorus 1
0% and potash 1
0%
 byogas sanyantra se jab slori ke rup main khaad baahar aata he tab jitna nitrogen gobar main hota he utana hi nitrogen slori main bhi hota he, parantu sanyantra main pachan kriya ke dauraan carbon kaa roopaantar gas main hone se carbon kaa pramaan kam hone se carbon nitrogen anupaat kam ho jaataa he va isse nitrogen kaa pramaan badha hua prathit hota he
 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefit is like chemical fertilizer immediately on the crop and in production 10 to 20 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
