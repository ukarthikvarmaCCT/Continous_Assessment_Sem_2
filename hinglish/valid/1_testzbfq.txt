 In this way, one, ten, hundred, sahasra etc
 came to be used for measuring numbers
 ganit vishyak vibhinn prashn hal karne ke liye bhartiya vidwaanon ne vargamul, dhanmul or agyaat sankhyaon ko maaloom karne ke dhang nikaale
 The decimal system came into use to express small parts of numbers

 Impressed by the ease of this system, many other countries also adopted it
 belgium ne san 1833 or switzaraland ne san 1891 main is pranali ko apanaaya
 Germany, Holland, Russia and America also had a great impact on this system and these countries also adopted this type of system soon

 It is estimated that there were more than 150 types of weights and different methods of measurement in the country
 in kathinaaiyon se vastuon kaa adanapradaan tathaa unka sahi bhav maaloom karnaa bada kathin ho jaataa tha
 Due to the variation of the measurement weights, there is not even an accurate estimate of the decreasing prices of the items
 isse vyapaar kii bahut kshati haati he or kreta evam vikreta donon ko shankaa rahati he
 The method of bringing uniformity in the methods of measurement of weights was considered many times in India, but only in September, 1956, the Weights and Measures Model Act was passed
 28 disambar 1956 i
 ko usapar raashtrapati kii sweekruti praapt hone par kendriya sarkaar ko dashamik pranali ke baat or maap chalaane kaa adhikaar praapt hua
 By adopting this system, the government got the right to implement the same type of measurement and weighing methods in the whole country
 isse vyapaar or vastuon ke yatayaat main badi sahaayta mili
 The ease of the decimal system also made it easier to calculate and weigh transactions
 is pranali ke anusaar lambaai maapne kii ikai meter he, jo ek gaj se lagbhag teen inch bada hota he
 Similarly, the unit of mass load is kilogram and the unit of scale of liquid material is liter

 The IRR is also called the effective interest rate in terms of savings and loans
 shabd aantarik is tathy ko sandarbhit karata he ki isaki gananaa paryaavarniya karkon ko shaamil nahin karti he 
 An investment or potential investment at an internal rate of return is the annualized effective complex rate of return
 is dar ko poonji nivesh kar arjeet kiya ja saktaa he
 In more familiar terms, the IRR of an investment is the interest rate at which the cost of the investment benefits the investment
 iskaa matlab yah he ki nivesh se hue sabhi laabh dhan ke samay mulya ke nihit hai or isiilie is byaaj dar main nivesh kaa shuddh vartmaan mulya shunya he
 Because the internal rate of return is a measurement rate, it is an indicator of work efficiency, quality, or investment income
 ye shuddh vartmaan mulya ke bilkul vipareet he
 It is an indication of the value or magnitude of the investment
 ek nivesh ko sweekaarya tab mana jaataa he jab uski aantarik pratifal dar vaapasi kii sthapana kii ek nunatam sweekaarya dar se adhik he
 In a scenario where investments are determined by one of the companies which has share holders

 If the sequence is oriented, iterations of the formula can continue indefinitely so that r { \ displaystyle r} can be found at arbitrary degrees of accuracy
 anukram kaa abhisaran vyavhaar nimnlikhit se niyantrit hota he: When NPV { \ displaystyle { \ mbox {NPV}}} \ mbox {NPV} _ {0} it will be r 1> r 0 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle {r_ {1}> r_ {0}}} \ scriptstyle {r_1 \ mbox {NPV} _ {0} or when NPV 0 { \ displaystyle { \ mbox {NPV}} _ {0}} \ mbox {NPV} _ {0}, it will not be able to be parsed: { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle {r_1} \ scriptstyle {r_1 These can increase the speed of convergence from {5 / } r_n to r { \ displaystyle r} r sankhyatmak punaruktiyaan baari or aasaani se aksham ho sakate hai

 But it should be used only to weigh the importance of a project on the basis of how useful that project is for investing
 un maamalon main jahaan ek pariyojna jisaki shuruuaati nivesh duusari parsparik vishisht pariyojna se zyada hoti he
 The IRR of the first project may be low but its NPV may be high and hence it should be adopted in lieu of the second project pariyojna ke dauraan IRR sakaaratmak nakadi pravaah kii khapat karne kii sochataa he
 If positive capital flows can invest back into the project, then a suitable reinvestment rate will be required which will calculate reinvestment capital flows and hence IRR is reinvested with capital flows

 But in the end it sees only one cash outflow chunki IRR puunji kii laagat par vichaar nahin karata he, iskaa prayog alag-alag avadhiyon vaali pariyojnaon kii tulana ke liye nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The revised internal return rate considers the cost of capital and gives a better indication of a project's ability to contribute to the firm's discounted cash flow
 sakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke maamle main jiske peeche nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah chalata rahata he, iiar kaa ekaadhik maan ho saktaa he
 In this case a discount rate can be used to quote cash flow and the IRR calculation can be used for investment cash flow
 yah udhaaharan tab lagu hota he jab ek graahak vishisht mashin ke banane se pehle raashi jamaa karwaata he
 In a series of cash flows, such as an initially invested amount of money, a higher rate of return is best, but is then owned by more than one person
 isliye ek kisi or kii dhan raashi kaa rini hota he, isliye ab kam dar vaale pratifal sabase achche hai
 In this case it is not clear whether more IRR is better or less IRR
 a project can have multiple irrs, as in example 0% and 10%
 is tarah kii pariyojnaon kaa udahaaran khand khan or parmaanu bijli sanyantr hai, jahaan aamtaur par pariyojna ke ant main bahut zyada nakadi bahirpravaah hoti he In general, IRR can be calculated by solving a polynomial criterion
 yadi sameekaran kaa koi vaastaviktaa main adwitiya samaadhaan he to starm sutara kaa prayog tab kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, the solution of the IRR equation cannot be found in an analytical way but it can be solved by iterative method
 jab kisi pariyojna kii kai IRR hoti hai to uske punarnivesh ke laabh ke saath us pariyojna kii gananaa karnaa or bhi zyada aasaan ho sakati he em ai aar aar ke anusaar, jiskaa punarnivesh dar anumaanit hota he, aam taur par yah dar pariyojna kii laagat ke baraabar hota he
 Despite the strong academic choice of NPV, surveys indicate that authorities place more importance on IRR than NPV
 aam taur par, prabandhakon ko alag-alag tarah ke aakaaron ke niveshon kii tulana karnaa aasaan lagata he, agar ye tulana en pi ve ke dollaron se pratifal dar ke pratishat ke bare main ho to
 halaanki, vyapaar ke mulya kii drushti se dekhen to en pi ve phir bhi "adhik sateek" he
 As a measure of investment efficiency, the IRR has better insight into situations such as capital control
 haalaanki, jab parsparik rup se vishisht pariyojnaon kii tulana kii jaati he to en pi ve uchit upaay he
 Mathematical investment value has to pass through some rate of return, according to mathematics the value of investment is used to estimate exponential growth or decay according to some rate of return
 This estimate operates with cash flow impropriety and defines the IRR of a series of cash flows as any return rate that results in zero net present value
 is prakaar aantarik dar yaa daren pratifal dar ke kaary ke rup main shuddh vartmaan mulya kaa anusaran karti hai
 This process is continuous
 -100% shuddh vartmaan mulya ke pratifal dar kii ore chalem to, shuddh vartmaan mulya pichley nakadi pravaah ke chinh ke saath anant kii ore aage badhata he or pratifal dar kaa sakaaratmak anant, shuddh vartmaan mulya pratham nakadi pravaah kii ore bad jaataa he 
 isliye, yadi pehali or aakhri nakadi pravaah ke alag-alag chinh hai to vahaan par aatanrik pratifal dar maujuud he
 Example of time series without IRR: sakaaratmak shrinkhalaaon ke baad vishesh rup se nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke maamle main nakadi pravaah kaa kul mulya sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke bich main samay ke rup main parivartit hota he
 The results of the return rate function, positive and negative, are constant from infinity and in a similar way, so there is a unique rate of return, for which it is zero, so the IRR is also unique
 haalanki iske puure prakshetra main ye zaruri nahin he ki NPV bhi ek saamaan tareeke se kam hota rahe aisa IRR par hota he Similarly, IRR is also unique, especially in terms of positive cash flow and especially negative cash flow

 It may have the function of dissolving or transporting foreign particles and the distribution of heat
 lubricant ke liye ekal sabase bade prayojanon main ek he, motor oil ke rup main, motor vaahanon or vidyut chaalit upkarnon main aantarik dahan ingine kii suraksha
 Typically lubricants contain 90% base oil and less than 10% additives
 kabhi-kabhi base oil ke rup main vanaspati tel yaa hydrogen se yukt polyolefins, aster, silicon, flourocarbon jaise synthetic drav or kai anya synthetic taral padaarthon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Additives cause less friction and wear, increased viscosity, improved viscosity index, resistance to corrosion and oxidation, aging or contamination, etc
 2-saaikal oil jaise lubricant bhi kuch indhanon main milaae jate hai
 Sulfur impurities in fuels provide some lubricating properties, which have to be taken into account when changing to low-sulfur diesel; Biodiesel is a popular diesel fuel additive that provides additional smoothness
 gaiyr-taral lubricanton main shaamil hai greez, powder, nalsaazi main prayukt tefflon tepe, air kushan or anya
 grefite, molybdenum dicelphid, tungston dicelphid jaise sookhe lubricant, taral or tel-aadhaarit lubricanton kii sanchaalan kshamta kii tulana main ucch taapmaana chiknayee pradaan karte hai
 Limited interest has been observed in the low friction properties of solid oxide glaze levels formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems, however, their practical use is many years away due to their physically unstable nature
 gharshan or ghisaav kam karne ke liye ek or drushtikon he ball bering, roller bering yaa air bering jaise beringon kaa upyog, jinke liye badale main aantarik chiknayee kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, yaa acustic lubrication ke maamle main, dhwani kaa upyog
 In addition to industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other purposes
 anya upyogon main shaamil hai khaanaa pakaana, maanvon par jaev-chikitsiya prayojan, ultra-sound pareekshan, purushon or mahilaon ke liye aantarik pareekshan or yon prayojanon ke liye vyaktigat lubricant kaa istemaal
 Lubricants perform the following important functions
 aam taur par lubricant ko kisi pranali main gatisheel bhaagon ko alag rakhane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 This has the advantage of reducing surface labor while reducing friction and heat generation, operating noise and vibration
 lubricant ise kai tareekon se hasil karte hai
 The most common is by the formation of a physical barrier, ie the lubricant separates the moving parts
 ise hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 At high surface pressures or temperatures the fluid layer is very thin and some forces are transmitted to the surfaces through the lubricant
 ise elasto-hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 Lubricant-to-surface friction is generally less than surface-to-surface friction in any system of lubricant
 is prakaar lubricant kaa upyog samgr pranali ke gharshan ko kam kar detaa he
 Low friction has the advantage of low heat generation and low formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency
 Lubricants may include additives called friction modifiers that chemically bind solid surfaces to reduce surface friction, even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant for hydrodynamic lubrication, e
g
 Protection of valve train in car engine at start-up
 donon gas or taral lubricant taap antarit kar sakate hai
 However, liquid lubricants are more effective due to their high specific heat capacity
 aam taur par taral lubricant pranali ke cooler bhaag se or usamen parichaalit hota he, haalanki lubricant kaa istemaal garm tathaa thande karne ke liye ho saktaa he jab niyantrit taapmaana kii aavashyaktaa ho
 yah parisanchari pravaah kisi niyat samay main ikai main dur jane vaale taap kii maatra bhi nirdhaarit karata he
 High flow systems can carry a lot of heat and also have the added benefit of reducing thermal stress on the lubricant
 is tarah kam laagat vaale taral lubricant kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The primary drawback is that large flows typically require large caps and large cooling units
 ek gaun dosha yah he ki ucch pravaah pranali jo lubricant ko thermal tanaav se bachaane ke liye pravaah dar par nirbhar karti he, achaanak pranali ke band hone par vipattipurna vifaltaa ke liye atisamvedansheel he
 a typical example is an automotive oil-cooled turbo charger
 terbocharger sanchaalan ke dauraan garm laal ho jate hai or unhen thanda karne vaala tel batch rahata he kyonki pranali main uskaa rahane kaa samay bahut kam he arthath ucch pravaah dar
 yadi pranali ko achaanak band kar diya jaae terbo charger main maujuud tel kaa turant oxikaran hota he or nikshep sahit tel margon ko avaruddh karegaa
 samay ke saath shitalan kam karte hue, ye nikshep tel margon ko puri tarah avaruddh kar sakate hai, jiske parinamswaroop jam beringon ke saath aam taur par terbo charger puri tarah band ho jaataa he
 Non-flowing lubricants such as grease and paste are not effective during heat transfer, although at first they contribute by reducing heat generation
 lubricant sancharan pranaaliyon se aantarik rup se janit malbe or pranali main aane vaale bahya dooshit padaarthon ko dur le jane kaa laabh he, jo filter main pahunchate hai jahaan se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Lubricants for machines that routinely generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically include detergents and dispersed additives to transport and remove debris and contaminants to the filter
 samay ke saath filter bhar jayega or safaai yaa use badalane kii zarurat hogi, atah sifarish kii jaati he ki car main tel badalte samay oil filter bhi badal daalen
 gear box jaisi band pranaaliyon main filter main chumbak anupoorak shaamil ho saktaa he taaki utpann baariq lohe ke chure aakarshith ho jaaen
 It is clear that oil in a communications system can only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that no industry standards exist that allow consumers to easily evaluate the filtering ability of various automotive filters
 Can
 Poor filtration specifically reduces the life of the machine as well as disables the system
 hydrolic taral ke rup main gyaat lubricant kaa upyog hydrostatic vidyut sanchaar main kaaryakari taral padaarth ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Hydraulic fluids comprise a large fraction of all lubricants produced worldwide
 swat: sancharan kaa anthan parivartak lubricant ke saath vidyut pareshan ke liye ek or mahatvapurn prayojan he
 Lubricants prevent rubbing by keeping the moving parts separate
 lubricant main ragad-rodhi yaa atyadhik dabaav vaale yojak bhi ho sakate hai jo ragad or shram ke prati unke nishpaadan ko badhaava dete hai
 Generally good quality lubricants are formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces to prevent corrosion and rusting
 lubricant gatisheel hisson ke bich keshika bal ke zarie nikasi ko gherta he, jisase nikasi band ho jaati he
 This effect can be used to seal pistons and shafts
 romavaasi wagon ke pahiyon ko chikna karne ke liye pashuon kii vasa main duube chithdon kaa istemaal karte the; tathaapi chiknayee kaa vigyaan vastav main keval unnisvin sadi main audyogic kranti ke saath aage badha
 Typically lubricants are made with more base oil and some additives for the required characteristics
 taral lubricanton kii tulana main gasiy lubricant main bahut kam chipchipahat or adhik sampeden hoti he, lekin taral-jhilli siddhant gaison ke samroop lagu hote hai
 Some examples of gaseous lubricants are air, technical gases, steam or liquid-metal vapor
 taral lubricant ke lakshan kai alag tareekon se varnit kiye ja sakate hai
 One of the most common methods is by the type of base oil used
 The following are the most common types
 note: haalanki aam taur par lubricant ek yaa duusare prakaar ke base oil par aadhaarit hai, yah sambhav he ki nishpaadan apekshaaon kii purti ke liye base oil ke mishranon kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 a natural water repellent, lanolin is derived from sheep wool grease and is an alternative to the more common petrochemical-based lubricants
 yah lubricant zang nirodhak bhi he, jo zang, lavan or amlon se raksha karata he
 Water itself can be used, or in combination with any other base oil, as a major component
 saamanytah milling or leath terning jaisi ejineering prakriyaaon main prayukt hota he
 The term is used to describe lubricating base oil derived from crude oil
 american petroleum institute vibhinn prakaar ke lubricant base oil ko nirdisht karata he jinaki nimna rup main pahchaan kii gai he: Such as naphthenics, PAG, esters, etc
 lubricant udyog saamanytah is samooh shabdaawalee ko nimna shaamil karne ke liye vistrut karti he: Can be classified into three categories based on the prevailing structures: ye mukhya rup se paudhon or jaanwaron se praapt triglisride aster hai
 Vegetable derived material is preferred for the use of lubricant base oil
 aam telon main shaamil hai ucch oleik canola tel, arandi kaa tel, palm tel, surajamukhi ke bijon kaa tel, vanaspati se repasid tel or pashu sroton se tol tel
 kai vanaspati telon ko aksar amla kii upaj ke liye hydrlise kiya jaataa he jinhen baad main vishisht synthetic aster banane ke liye chuninda taur par sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 Whale oil has historically been an important lubricant, being used as an abrasive modifier additive for automatic circulating liquid until the late 20th century
 tefflon PTFE aam taur par coating parat ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye, khaanaa pakaane ke bartan non-stick sataha uplabdh karaane ke liye
 iskaa vyavhaarya taapmaana 350 °C tak vistrut he or rasinic niskriyata ise vishesh greezon main upyogi yojak banaati he
 Under extreme pressure, teflon powder or solid is of no value, as it softens and flows away from the contact area
 tab chini mitti yaa dhaatu yaa mishra dhaatu lubricant kaa upyog kiya janaa chahie
 Graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are examples of materials that can be used as solid lubricants to much higher temperatures than normal
 kuch aisi saamagree kaa upyog kabhi-kabhi unke karaab oxikaran pratirodh dwaara pratibandhit ho jaataa he 
 Metal alloys, composite and pure metals can be used as grease additives or as a single component of sliding surfaces and bearings
 cadmium or sona, satahon par chadhaane ke liye istemaal hote hai jo unhen acha gharshan pratirodh or sarakan gun pradaan karte hai, sisa, tin, zinc mishra-dhaatu or vibhinn kaansya mishra-dhaatuon kaa upyog phisalane vaale bering ke liye istemaal hota he, yaa unke powder ko keval phisalane vaali satahon ko chikna banane ke liye, yaa greezon main yojak ke rup main prayog main laa sakate hai
 Another phenomenon on which research has been done in high temperature breakdown prevention and lubrication is 'layer climbing'
 It is the generation of a solid oxide layer, which normally accumulates at high temperatures, with metal surfaces sliding against each other to form a crystalline 'layer'
 Friction and wear can be reduced due to the avoidance of metal contact and adhesion by the production of oxides
 prabhavi rup se, is tarah kii sataha swa-chiknayee vaali hoti he
 Since the 'layer' is already an oxide, it can survive at very high temperatures in air or oxidizing environments
 tathaapi, aadhaar dhaatu ke liye zaruri hone kii vajah se ise asuvidha he ki paryaapt oxide malba utpann karne ke liye pehle ise tut-foot se guzaranaa hoga
 a large number of additives are used to provide performance characteristics to the lubricant
 yojakon ke mukhya parivaar hai: Note that many basic chemical compounds that are used as detergents also serve as the purpose of the first seven items in the list
 aam taur par aarthik rup se yaa takneekee rup se sab kaam ke liye ek yojak mishran kaa prayog vyavhaarya nahin he
 Oil has a high content of EP additives for hypoid gear lubrication

 samagratah pashchimi bazaar ko mandi se lekar samgr maatra kii giravat ke saath paripakv mana ja saktaa he jabaki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon main majboot vikaas he
 Lubricant marketers generally follow any or many of the following strategies --- when doing business
 lubricant kathith taur par ek nishchit vinirdesh ko puraa karata he
 In the consumer market, this is often supported by a logo, symbol, or words that inform consumers that the lubricant marketer has done independent verification of conformance to the specification
 iske udaahranon main shaamil hai API kaa donot logo yaa NSF kaa tik mark
 sabase vyapak rup se dekha gaya he SAE chipchipaapan vinirdesan, jaise SAE 10W-40
 chiknayee ke vinirdesh santhaan or nirmaataa aadhaarit hai
 At the American Institute: API s for petrol engines, API C
 for diesel engines
 The current specifications for 2007 are API SM and API CJ
 The higher second letter indicates better oil properties, such as less engine failure supported by tests
 ACEA specifications are used in the European Union
 vahaan shreniyan maujuud hai A, B, C, e akshar kaa anusaran karti sankhyaon ke saath
 japan ne motorbike injanon ke liye JASO vinirdesan pravartit kiya
 In the industrial market, the specification may take the form of a legal contract that supplies the corresponding fluid, or the buyer can choose to purchase based on the manufacturer's own published specifications
 aksar vinirdesh ek nunatam sweekaarya nishpaadan str nirupit karte hai
 Thus many device manufacturers tighten the tolerance on a common specification to add to their specific requirements or to meet their needs
 This gives lubricant marketers the opportunity to differentiate their product by designing to meet the OEM specification
 aksar, OEM vyapak pareekshan karata he or anumodith utpaadon kii sakriy suchi kaa anurakshan karata he
 It is a powerful marketing tool in the lubricant market
 motor oil label ke peeche paath main aam taur par kuch OEM vinirdeshnon kii suchi hoti he, jaise ki MB, MAN, Volvo, Cummins, VW, BMW yaa anya
 vinirmaataaon ke paas unke dwaara nirmit vividh injanon ke liye behad alag vinirdesh ho sakate hai; ek puri tarah se anya ke liye upyukt nahin ho saktaa he
 The lubricant marketer claims benefits for the customer based on the superior performance of the lubricant
 is tarah ke vipanan glamras vigyapanon, khaas khel kaaryakramon ke praayojan or andorsement dwaara samarthit hote hai
 Unfortunately widespread performance claims are common in the consumer market, making verification difficult or impossible for a specific consumer
 B2B bazaar main vipanak se saamanyatya unke daavon kaa samarthan karne vaale data ko darshane kii aashaa kii jaati he, jisase vyapak daavon kaa istemaal kam ho sake
 nishpaadan badhanaa, tut-foot or indhan kaa upbhog ghataana bhi baad ke API, ACEA or car nirmaataaon ke oil vinirdeshnon kaa lakshya rahaa he, jisase lubricant vipanak vyapak pareekshanon dwaara apane daavon kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 The market claims that their lubricant maintains its performance for a long period
 udhaaharan ke liye upabhokta bazaar main, ek theth motor oil parivartan antaraal lagbhag 3,000–6,000 mile ke aas-paas he
 Lubricant marketers can offer a lubricant that lasts 12,000 miles or more to persuade the user to pay a premium

 dhyaan den ki oil dren antaraal car nirmaataa vinirdesh ke anuroop indhan ke saath nae ingine ke liye maanya he
 When low grade fuel is used, or an older engine, the oil change interval should be reduced accordingly
 Common oils approved for extended use are of high specification and minimize spoilage
 audyogic bazaar main dderghaayu ko aam taur par samay kii ikaayiyon main mapa jaataa he or unke daawey pramanit na hone kii sthiti main lubricant vipanak ko baari vittiya jurmaana bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Lubricant marketers claim advanced equipment efficiency compared to anti-products or technologies, a claim that can generally be valid when comparing high-grade lubricants with previous grades
 In general, efficiency is proved by showing a reduction in the cost of energy to operate the system
 unnat dakshata kii guarantee dena, deazal injanon ke liye API CI-4 Plus jaise kuch tel pareekshan vinirdeshon kaa lakshya hota he
 Some car / engine manufacturers also request some higher efficiency levels of lubricant, especially for extended drain intervals
 lubricant ke liye daawa kiya gaya ki vah vishisht parichaalan pariveshon kii jaruraton se nipat saktaa he

 chipchipaapan suchakank taapmaana ke saath chipchipaapan parivartan ankit karata he, jahaan ucch VI sankhya adhik taapmaana sthirataa ke liye he
 Marketers offer either the same grade or a similar price at a lower price than rivals, which will serve the purpose for a lower price
 Alternatives are proposing a more expensive lubricant and may promise less spoilage, specific fuel consumption or return at longer drain intervals
 lubricant ko paryaavaran anukool kaha gaya he
 This is generally supported by qualifications of qualifying statements or generally accepted approvals
 duniya bhar main kai sanghathan, aam taur par sarkaar pryojit, aise lubricanton kii paryaavarniya jokhim ke liye unke moolyankan dwaara visheshta bataane or anumodith karne ke liye maujuud hai
 Generally, lubricant manufacturers are permitted to indicate such approval by showing some special mark
 udaahranon main shaamil hai german "blue angil", europea "dezi" paristhitiki label, vaishvik paristhitiki label "GEN mark", nordic, "white swen", japani "arth frendli mark"; sanyukt raashtra america "green sil", canadai "environmental choiz", chini "huaan", singapore "green label" or francisi "NF environment mark"
 Marketers claim a new structure of lubricant that will improve some concrete performance compared to its rivals
 The technology is generally protected through formal patents or other intellectual property protection mechanisms to prevent copying by rivals
 is kshetra main anek daawey bahut saral vipanan gunjaar shabd hai, kyonki unamem se zyaadaatar nirmaataa vishisht prakriyaaon se jude hai lekin pratispardhaa ke liye trademark kaa upyog nishiddh he
 The marketer claims extensive superior quality of its lubricant without factual evidence
 gunvattta prasiddh brands, khilaadi, racing team, kuch peshewar andorsement yaa kuch samaan vyaktiparak daawey ke sandarbh dwaara "siddh" he
 All motor oil labels have signs like "good quality" or "quality additive", the actual comparative evidence is not always there
 yah anumaan he ki sabhi lubricanton kaa 40% maahaul main jari hota he
 Disposal: Recycling, combustion, landfill and release into water can dispose of used lubricant

 Other direct contamination sources include falling off roadways, accidental scattering, natural or man-made disasters and pipeline leakages
 Improvement in filtration technology and processes has now made recycling a viable option
 Generally, various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and obtain the base oil
 prakriya ke dauraan tel kaa parishkaran ho saktaa he
 This base oil is later processed in the same way as virgin base oil, although there is substantial reluctance to use recycled oils as they are considered inferior

 While on the one hand the socialist movement and their international organization almost disintegrated at the beginning of it, on the other hand, there was a Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the foundation of the first successful socialist state in the world, which had a profound impact on the socialist movements of the world

 But as soon as the war started, except for the socialist parties of Russia and Italy, the majority of all the parties supported the policy of their governments

 Industries in Russia were few, but large in scale and hired more workers than expected
 at: in mazdooron main raajnneetik chetana or sanghathan adhik tha
 In the absence of democracy, it was difficult for the workers to struggle, so the working class came under revolutionary influence and due to the conditions like Germany, most of the labor leaders here were also influenced by Marxist and Germany's Social Democratic Party
 san 1890 ke lagbhag excrod or plekhanov ne petersvarg main pratham majdoor samooh sthapit kiye jo aage chalakar 1898 main roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor party ke aadhaar bane
 The leader of the Russian Social Democratic Democratic Labor Party was a staunch Marxist, so he rejected recapitalism and developed Marxism and applied it to Russian conditions
 mazdooron kii rahan sahan ke str main unnati hui thi, is satya ko na maananaa kathin tha, parantu plekhanov ne siddh kiya ki nai mashiinon ke prayog or mazdooree main apekshaya vruddhi na hone ke kaaran poonjeewaadi shoshan kii dar badhati ja rahi he
 Bukharin argued that imperialist countries were able to keep their working class satisfied by exploiting the colonies
 tratski aadi ne kaha ki poonjeewaadi kaa sankat sarvyaapee ho gaya he or is sthiti main yah sambhav he ki kranti pashchim europe ke agrani deshon main na hokar apekshaakrit pichde deshon main, jahaan samrajyavaadee kadi sabase kamjor he, vahaan ho
 Some thinkers first showed Russia the location of the socialist revolution
 tratski or lenin kaa mat tha ki samaajawaadee kranti usee samay safal ho sakati he jab vah kai deshon main ek saath faile, sthaayee kranti ke bina keval ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana kathin he
 Later Lenin and Stalin amended this principle to create Soviet power on the basis of unilateral socialism
 nikolai lenin ne uparyukt vichaaron kaa samanvay karke bolshevik dal kaa sanghathan or oktober kranti kaa netritv kiya
 At the London Conference of 1903, the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party articulated its socialist ideal, but within this class party two ideologies emerged and later they formed two parties
 is conference main utpaadan ke sadhano ke rashtriyakaran, jameendaari unmoolan, upniveshon kaa aatmanirmaan kaa adhikaar, dhyey kii prapti kaa krantikari maarg or kranti ke baad sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee-is niti ko sweekaar kiya gaya, parantu dal ke sanghathan ke sambandh main netaaon main matbhed ho gaya
 The question was whether the membership of the party should be limited only to the workers or every person accepting the ideals should be its officer and should the Central Committee have the right to dissolve the branches of the party and appoint new branches in their place? Lenin was in favor of a well-organized party with military discipline and had a majority in the conference, hence the name of this section was Bolshevik and the second section was called Menshevik
 aage chalakar in dalon ke bich or bhi matbhed upasthit hue
 The Menshevik Party first wanted to end the capitalist democratic revolution of the end of Tsarism and in this revolution, it wanted to cooperate with the left side of the capitalist parties, but after the revolution of 1905, Lenin and his companions came to the conclusion that due to fear of socialist revolution, capitalism Has become reactionary, therefore it is also unable to lead the capitalist democratic revolution
 isliye is kranti kaa netritv bhi keval sarvhaara varg hi kar saktaa he or is kranti ko sarvhaara kranti ke saath milakar jaarshahi ke baad ekadam samaajwaad kii sthapana sambhav he
 Lenin was in favor of dividing feudal land among the peasants to get the support of the peasants in the revolution, the Mensheviks wanted to socialize it immediately
 bolshevik dal ne pratham mahayuddh kaa virodh kiya or samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye grihayuddh kaa naaraa diya
 The war-torn public, and especially the Russian troops, welcomed this policy, but the Mensheviks did not oppose the war and continued the war by joining the government after the February March revolution
 san 1917 kii oktober kranti main lenin ke vichaaron or bolshevik sanghathan kii vijay hui
 After the Paris Commune of 1871, in 1917, the first permanent socialist state - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established
 is rajya main utpaadan ke sadhano-udyog dhandhe, vyapaar, vinimay, bhoomi aadi-kaa rashtriyakaran kiya gaya or shoshak varg kii aarthik tathaa raajnneetik shakti kaa ant kar diya gaya
 Within the country, initially the representatives of peasants, laborers and soldiers were ruled by mixed Soviets, but according to the constitution of 1936, a bicameral parliament was established
 iske upree sadan kaa chunaav soviet desh ke vibhinn ganraajyon dwaara hota he tathaa nimna sadan ke sadsy kshetreey nirvachan kshetron dwaara chune jate hai
 But Soviet countries are one-party states, the state power is in the hands of communist party
 kisi duusare dal ko raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa adhikaar nahin
 After the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party named itself the Communist Party and in 1919 published a second Communist Manifesto, on the basis of which a new international movement - Communist International - was established and with its help started the propagation of communism in various countries
 lenin ke vichaaron ko samyawad kii sangya di jaati he, parantu lenin ke baad joseph stallin maotsethung nikita chrishchov tathaa vibhinn deshon ke samyavaadee netaaon ne in vichaaron kii vyakhya or unka vikaas kiya he
 All these ideas fall under the category of communism
 stallin ke vichaaron main uskaa upniveshon ko aatmanirnay kaa adhikaar, niojit arthvyavastha arthath panchavarshiya aadi yojanaayen tathaa samuhik or rajkeey swaamitv main kheti mukhya hai
 The impact of socialism increased in the world between the Second World War and after the success of Soviet forces and other international conditions
 yuddh kaa ant hone tak na keval purvi europe soviet prabhavakshetra ban gaya, varan san 1948 i
 tak inamen se adhikansh deshon main samyavaadee rajya sthapit ho gaye
 In Asia too, communism was successful in a large country like China and under the influence of Soviet and People's Republic of China, the rule of North Asia and North Vietnam came under communist influence
 samyawad kaa asar sabhi deshon main badha
 Countries such as France, Italy and Hindustia have powerful communist parties
 parantu samyawad ke prasar ne us andolan ke saamne kai saidhantik or vyaavhaarik kathinaaiyaan upasthit kii hai- Communist Yugoslavia's ruler Josip Brozovit Tito and his other communist allies were the first to challenge the Soviet leadership
 yugoslavia bahut kuch apane prayatnon se swatantra hua tha at: uske andar swabhimaan kii bhaavana thi
 He was also not surrounded by Soviet influence like other communist countries of East Europe
 yugoslav paksh kaa kahana tha ki soviet sarkaar unki audyogic unnati main baadhak he tathaa unki swatantraaa ko simit karti he
 His stanzas later proved to be true, but at that time Titoism was called the pivot of recidivism, Trotskyism or imperialism
 siddhant ke str par titowad ne rashtriya samyavad, shakti ke vikendrikaran, kisaanon dwaara bhoomi kaa nijee swaamitv, rajya or naukarshahi ke sthaan main udyogon par mazdooron kaa niyantran tathaa samyavaadee dal or desh ke andar apekshaakrit adhik swadhinata par jor diya
 Tito's ideas have had an impact on other communist countries in Eastern Europe
 samyavaadee deshon ke bich samanta kii maang ko sweekaar karke khrushchov ne titowad ko anshat: sweekaar kiya, parantu saath hi usne lenin stallinavaad main bhi kai mahatvapurn sanshodhan kiye hai
 Lenin thought that until the end of imperialism, there would be war in the world, but according to Khrushkov, at this time the powers of progress are so strong that world war can be stopped and peaceful coexistence between capitalist and socialist systems is possible
 vah yah bhi kahata he ki in paristhitiyon main samaajwaad kii sthapana kaa keval krantikari maarg hi nahin he, varan vibhinn deshon main alag alag samyavaadee dalon dwaara vikasvaadi or shantimay tareekon se bhi uski sthapana sambhav he
 In the other countries of the world, the above thought change has had a profound effect on communist ideology
 tito ke vidroh ke baad purv europe ke anya samyavaadee deshon ne bhi soviet prabhaav se swatantra hone kaa praytn kiya he
 The Russian communists reject Khrushchev's amendments and the military conflict between the Soviet and China is not only getting worse
 sansar ke lagbhag sabhi samyavaadee dal soviet or chini vichaardhaaraon ke aadhaar par vibhakt hote ja rahe hai kuch vichaarak rashtriya samyavaadee dalon kii saidhantik or sanghathanaatmak swatantraaa par bhi jor dete hai
 Thus the unity and internationalism of communist ideas and movement is declining
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad samyawad kii hi nahin loktantratmak samaajwaad kii bhi pragati hui he
 In the midst of the two great wars Britain had twice as many working governments
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad germany or austria main samaajawaadee shashan sthapit hue; france or spain aadi deshon main samaajawaadee dalon kii shakti badi
 But soon their response also started
 san 1922 main benito musolini ne italy main phacist shashan sthapit kiya
 Fascism is an enemy of labor and socialist movements and a supporter of war and imperialism

 dwitiya mahayuddh ke bich fasivadi vichaaron kaa hraas tathaa samaajawaadee vichaaron or andolanon kii pragati hui he
 In addition to the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, for some time in Western Europe, several countries formed joint regimes in collaboration with socialist and communist parties
 europe ke kuch anya deshon jaise tathaa austrailia or newjiland aadi deshon main samay samay par samaajawaadee sarkarein banati rahi hai
 In this period, countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have also established socialist rule

 Abraham Ortelius as a Flemish cartographer and geographer, creator of traditional recognition of the first modern atlas, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum
 Ortelius is often considered one of the founders of the Dutch School of Cartography and one of the most notable representatives of the school in its golden age
 The Atlas of Publication in 1570 is often regarded as the official beginning of Dutch cartography of the Golden Age
 He is also the first person to be assumed to have imagined that continents were linked together before drifting to its current position

 More than four Additamenta were to follow, the last one appearing in 1597
 He also had a keen interest and formed a fine collection of coins, medals and antiques, and as a result of this Deorum dearumque person in the book

 Kious varnit Ortelius' vichaaron main is tarah se he: Ortelius's observations of the continental counterpoint and his proposal of breakage and separation were repeated by Alfred Wegner who published his hypothesis of continental drift in 1912 and in subsequent years
 Because his publications are widely available in German and English, and because he considers adduced geological support for consideration, Wegner is credited as the first geologists most likely to identify continental drift
