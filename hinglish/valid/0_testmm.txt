 Lord Shri Krishna said that the name of Ekadashi of Kartik Krishna Paksha is Rama

 i tell you its significance, listen carefully
 he rajan! prachinkaal main muchukund naam kaa ek raja tha
 He had a friendship with Indra, as well as Yama, Kubera, Varuna and Vibhishan
 yah raja bada dharmatma, vishnubhakt or nyaay ke saath raaj karata tha
 That king had a daughter named Chandrabhaga
 us kanya kaa vivaah chandrasen ke putr shobhan ke saath hua tha
 At one time he came to Shobhan's in-laws
 unheen dinon jaldi hi punyadayini ekadshi bhi aane vaali thi
 When the day of the fast came near, Chandrabhaga had a very thinking in my mind that my husband is very weak and my father's order is very harsh
 dashami ko raja ne dhol bajwakar saare rajya main yah ghoshnaa karvaa di ki ekadshi ko bhojan nahin karnaa chahie
 On hearing the announcement of the drum, Shobhan was very worried and told his wife that hey dear! What to do now, i will not be able to bear hunger in any way
 aisa upaay batalaao ki jisase mere praan batch saken, anyathaa mere praan avashya chale jaayenge
 Chandrabhaga started saying that, o Lord! No one eats food on Ekadashi during my father's rule
 hathi, ghoda, oont, billi, gau aadi bhi trin, ann, jal aadi grahan nahin kar sakate, phir manushya kaa to kahana hi kya he
 If you want to have a meal then move to some other place, because if you want to stay here, you must fast
 aisa sunakar shobhan kehane laga ki he priye! main avashya vrath karunga, jo bhagya main hoga, vah dekha jayega
 Thinking like this, Shobhan fasted and started suffering from hunger and thirst
 jab surya narayan ast ho gaye or raatri ko jaagran kaa samay aayaa jo vaishnavon ko atyant harsh dene vaala tha, parantu shobhan ke liye atyant du:khadaayi hua
 Shobhan died in the morning
 tab raja ne sugandhit kashtha se uskaa dah sanskaar karavaaya
 But Chandrabhaga did not burn her body as per her father's orders and after Shobhan's funeral procession, she stayed in her father's house
 rama ekadshi ke prabhaav se shobhan ko mandarachal parvat par dhan-dhaany se yukt tathaa shatruon se rahit ek sundar devpur praapt hua
 He was adorned on a throne decorated with precious robes and chhatras and chavars, decorated with many types of rhinestone beads built on extremely beautiful gems and vaiduryamani-carved gold pillars, mounted on a throne with Gandharvas and Apsaras as if the second Indra was seated
 ek samay muchukund nagar main rahane vaale ek som sharma naamak brahman tirthayatra karata hua ghumta-ghumta udhar ja niklaa or usne shobhan ko pahchaan kar ki yah to raja kaa jamaai shobhan he, uske nikat gaya
 Shobhan too recognizing him got up from his seat and came near him and bowed and asked a skilled question
 brahman ne kaha ki raja muchukund or aapaki patni kushal se hai
 The city is also skilled in every way, but o Rajan! We are surprised
 aap apana vrittant kahie ki aisa sundar nagar jo na kabhi dekha, na suna, aapako kaise praapt hua
 Then Shobhan said that i got this city by fasting on Rama Ekadashi of Kartik Krishna, but it is unstable
 yah sthir ho jaae aisa upaay kiijie
 The Brahmin started saying that, o Rajan! Tell me why it is not stable and how it can be stable, then i will definitely take that solution
 meri is baat ko aap mithyaa na samajhie
 Shobhan said that i have done this fast in reverence
 at: yah sab kuch asthir he
 If you call all the accounts of Muchukund's daughter Chandrabhaga, then it can be stable
 aisa sunakar us shreshth brahman ne apane nagar lautakar chandrabhaga se sab vrittant kah sunaaya
 Hearing the words of the Brahmin, Chandrabhaga started to say to the Brahmin with great pleasure, o Brahmin! You have seen all these things directly or are talking about dreams
 brahman kehane laga ki he putree! maine mahaavan main tumhaare pati ko pratyaksh dekha he
 Also, they have seen their city like a city of gods, so that there is no victory over anyone
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah sthir nahin he
 As soon as he can remain stable, then measures should be taken
 chandrabhaga kehane lagi he wipro! tum mujhe vahaan le chalo, mujhe patidev ke darshan kii teevr laalasaa he
 i will make that city stable with the virtue i have done
 aap aisa kaary kiijie jisase unka hamaara sanyog ho kyonki viyogi ko mila dena mahaan punya he
 Som Sharma, hearing this, went to the ashram of Rishi Vamdev near the Mandarachal mountain with Chandrabhaga
 vamdevji ne sari baat sunakar veda mantron ke uccharan se chandrabhaga kaa abhishek kar diya
 Then with the effect of the sage's mantra and fasting on Ekadashi, Chandrabhaga's body became divine and she attained divine speed
 iske baad badi prasannataa ke saath apane pati ke nikat gai
 Shobhan was overjoyed to see his beloved wife coming
 or use bulaakar apni bain taraf bitha liya
 Chandrabhaga started saying that, o Prannath! You accept my merit
 apane pita ke ghar jab main aath varsh kii thi tab se vidhipurvak ekadshi ke vrath ko shraddhapurvak karti aa rahi hoon
 With the virtue of this virtue, your city will become stable and will remain till the end of the Holocaust with all the deeds
 is prakaar chandrabhaga ne divya aabhushanon or vastron se susajjit hokar apane pati ke saath anandpurvak rahane lagi
 Hey Rajan! i have said this the greatness of Rama Ekadashi, all the sins of the people who perform this fast are destroyed
 krishna paksh or shukla paksh donon kii ekadashiyaan samaan hai, inamen koi bhedbhaav nahin he
 Both give similar results
 jo manushya is mahatmaya ko padhate athwa sunate hai, ve samast paapon se chhootakar vishnulok ko praapt hota hai
 Iti Shubham karthik maas main to praat: suryoday se purv uthne, snaan karne or danadi karne kaa vidhaan he
 For this reason, by getting up in the morning and taking a bath only, a person gets the fruits of performing several thousand yagyas, whereas the virtue of any fast done in this month is thousands of times more
 rama ekadshi vrath main bhagwaan vishnu ke purnavatar bhagwaan ji ke keshav rup kii vidhivat dhoop, deep, naivedhy, pushp evam mausam ke falon se puja kii jaati he
 Well, it is very important to have faith and faith in any fast, but God is always going to destroy the sins of his devotees, so if any devotee does any auspicious act unintentionally, then the Lord will be pleased with him and commit his sins
 Free him and save him
 jo bhakt prabhu kii bhakthi shraddha or aasthaa ke saath karte hai unke sabhi kashton kaa nivaaran prabhu avashya karte hai kyonki is din kiye gaye punya karm main shraddha, bhakthi evam aasthaa se hi manushya ko sthir punya fal kii prapti ho sakegi
