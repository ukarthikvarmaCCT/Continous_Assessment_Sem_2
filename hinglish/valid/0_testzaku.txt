 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga When the whole world was inundated and Lord Vishnu was sleeping on the bed of Sheshnag taking shelter of Yoganidra, at that time, two terrible asuras produced Madhu and Catabh from the filth of his ears
 ve donon brahmaji kaa vadh karne ko taiyaar ho gayi
 Prajapati Brahmaji, who was seated in the nucleus of Lord Vishnu, when both of those terrible asuras came to him and saw the Lord sleeping, then concentrated, he started the eulogy of Yoganidra residing in his eyes to awaken Lord Vishnu

 Then Lord Srihari only fought with both for five thousand years

 God said that if you are pleased with me, then kill me
 asuron ne kaha jahaan prithvi jal main dubi na ho, vahiin hamaara vadh karo
 Then God said both the foreheads and put them on his thigh and cut them from the circle

 turki kaa ek praant
 Microbiology is the study of microorganisms that are unicellular or microscopic cell-group animals
 inamen eucarots jaise kavak evam protist or procarots, jaise jeevanu or orchia aate hai
 Viruses have not been called permanent creatures or animals, yet they are also studied under this
 sankshep main sookshmjaiviki un sajivon kaa adhyayan he, jo ki nagn aankhon se dikhaai nahin dete hai
 Microbiology is a very broad term, which includes virology, fungi, parasitology, bacteriology, and many other branches
 sookshmjaiviki main tatpar shodh hote rahete hai evam yah kshetra anwarat pragati par agrasar he
 So far, we have probably studied only one percent of the entire earth's microorganisms
 haalaanki sookshmjeev lagbhag teen sau varsh purv dekhe gayi the, kintu jeev vigyaan kii anya shakhaon, jaise jantu vigyaan yaa padap vigyaan kii apeksha sookshmjaiviki apane ati praarambhik str par hi he
 The existence of microorganisms was estimated many centuries before their discovery
 in par sabase pehla siddhant pracheen roman vidwaan marcus terrencious vairro ne apni krishi par aadhaarit ek pustak main diya tha
 In this, he warned that fields should not be built near the marshes
 canan of medicine naamak pustak main, abu ali ebn sina ne kaha he ki sharir ke srav, sankramit hone se pehle bahari sookshmjivon dwaara dooshit kiye jate hai
 He envisaged the infectious nature of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, and used quarantine to prevent infectious diseases
 chaudaavin shatabdi main jab kaali mrityu va bubonic plig al-andailace main pahunchaa tab ebn khatima ne yah prakkalan kiya ki sookshmjeev maanav sharir ke andar pahunch kar, sankramak rog paidaa karti hai
 In 1546 Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemics are spread by transitional seed-like existence
 ye vastuen pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se kabhi kabhi to bina sampark ke hi lambi duuri se bhi sankramit kar sakati hai
 All these claims about microorganisms were only estimates because they were not based on any data or science
 satrahavin shatabdi tak sookshm jeev naa to siddh hi hue the or na hi dekhe gayi the
 They were rightly seen and described in the seventeenth century itself
 iskaa mul kaaran yah tha ki sabhi purv suchnaayen va shodh ek moolbhoot upkaran ke abhaav main kiye gayi the, jo sookshmjaiviki yaa jeevanuvigyaan ke astitv main rahane ke liye atyaavashyak tha or vah tha sookshmdarshi yantra
 Antoine von Leuvenhock was the first microbiologist who first saw microorganisms with a microscope, which is why he is called the father of microbiology
 inhone hi sookshmdarshi yantra kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed by Antoine von Leuvenhock in 1676 with a single-lens microscope
 aisa karke unhone jeev vigyaan ke kshetra main ek abhootpurv kaary kiya jiske dwaara jeevanu vigyaan va sookshmjaiviki kaa armbh hua
 The term bacterium was used much later by Ehrenberg
 yah unani shabd βακτηριον se niklaa he, jiskaa arth he - choti si tandi
 Although Leuvenhawk has been called the first microbiologist, but Robert Hooke, the first recognized microbiologist, is believed to have observed the function of mold
 jeevanu vigyaan ferdinand kohn dbaara sthapit kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 He was a plant scientist, whose research on algae and photosynthetic bacteria inspired him to describe many other bacteria including Bacillus and Baggiatoa
 kohn hi jeevanuon ke vargeekaran kii yojana ko paribhaashit karne vaale pratham vyakti the
 Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch were contemporaries of Kohn and are considered to be the founders of medical microbiology
 pashchar tatkaaleen sahaj utpaadan ke siddhant ko jhuthalane ke liye apane dwaara kiye gaye shreneebaddh prayogon ke liye prasiddh ho chuke the
 With this, the surface of microbiology became more solid
 pashchar ne khaadya sangrakshan ke upaay khoje the unhone hi enthraiks, foul cholera evam rabies sahit kai rogon ke suraksha tikon kii khoj kii thi
 Koch was famous for his theory of diseases, according to which a specific disease is caused by a specific pathogenic microorganism
 unhone hi kochs postulats banaaye the
 Koch has been the first of the scientists to isolate bacteria from pure culture
 jiske parinamswaroop kai naveen jeevanuon kii khoj va varnan kiye ja sake, jinamein micobacterium tuberculosis, kshay rog kaa mul jeevanu bhi rahaa
 Pasteur and Koch are often called the fathers of microbiology but their work does not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbiological world, as their focus was on microorganisms with direct medical contexts
 martins wiliam beijrink evam sarjei vinogradski, jo saamaanya sookshmjaiviki ke sansthaapak kahe jate hai, ke kaaryon ke uparaant hi, sookshmjaiviki kii sahi-sahi paridhi kaa gyaan hua
 Beijerink has two great contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of fertile culture techniques
 unke tambaaku mozike vishaanu par kiye gaye anusandhan kaary ne vishaanu vigyaan ke moolbhoot siddhant sthapit kiye the
 This was the development of his Enrichment Culture, which had an immediate impact on microbiology
 iske dwaara ek vrahat sookshmjivon kii shrunkhlaa ko sanwarddhit kiya ja sakaa, jinaki shaaririki vividh prakaar kii thi
 Winogradsky presented the first theory on inorganic chemical substances, which also revealed a very important role in the microbiological processes of microorganisms
 inhone hi sarvapratham nitriphoing tathaa nitrogen-phixing jeevanu kaa pruthakeekaran kiya tha
 There are many types of micro gvs in which bacteria are prominent
 jeevanu ek eckoshikeey jeev he
 Its size is only a few millimeters
 inaki akruti gol yaa mukt-chakrakaar se lekar chad aadi ke aakaar kii ho sakati he
 These are prokaryotic, cell wall-mounted, unicellular simple organisms that are often found everywhere
 ye prithvi par mitti main, amleey garm jal-dhaaraon main, nabhikeey padaarthon main, jal main, bhu-papadi main, yahan tak kii carbonic padaarthon main tathaa paudhun evam jantuon ke sharir ke bheetar bhi paye jate hai
 Generally, 40 million bacteria are found in one gram of soil and 1 million bacteria in 1 ml of water
 sampurna prithvi par anumaanatah lagbhag 5X1030 jeevanu paae jate hai
 Which is a big part of the world's biomass
 ye kai tatwon ke chakra main bahut mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karte hai, jaise ki vayumandal ke liye nitrogen ke sthirikaran main
 Although the division of bacteria of many lineages has not been done, however, almost any species of half of the population has been grown in the laboratory
 jeevanuon kaa adhyayan bacterology ke antargat kiya jaataa he jo sookshmjaiviki kii hi ek shakha he
 The human body has about 10 times as many bacterial cells as there are human cells
 inamen se adhikansh jeevanu twachaa tathaa ahaarnal main paae jate hai
 Harmful bacteria do not harm the body due to the protective effect of the protection mechanism
 kuch jeevanu laabhadaayak bhi hote hai
 Many types of parasitic bacteria cause many diseases, such as cholera, periodic fever, pneumonia, tuberculosis or tuberculosis, plague etc
 sirf kshay rog se prativarsh lagbhag 20 lakh log marate hai jinamein se adhikansh up-sahaara kshetra ke hote hai
 In developed countries, they are used to treat bacterial infections and for antibiotic experiments in agricultural work, so bacteria are developing immunity against these antibiotics
 audyogic kshetra main jeevanuon kii kinvan kriya dwaara dahi, paneer ityadi vastuon kaa nirmaan hota he
 They are used in the manufacture of antibiotics and chemicals and in the field of biotechnology
 iske atirikt vishaanu jo atisookshm jeev hai
 They die outside the body but become alive inside the body
 inhe crystal ke rup main ikattha kiya ja saktaa he
 Fungi, a type of plant, derive their food from rotten throat-free organic materials and whose greatest benefit is to act as a scavenger in the world, the protozoa which is a unicellular organism, whose cells are eukaryotic and normal
 It is easy to see with a microscope, Archaea or Archabacteria that are similar to bacteria in their simple form but Celled structure is very different
 or shaiwal jo saral sajiv hai, paudhon ke samaan surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya dwaara apana bhojan swany banaate hai or ek koshikeey se lekar bahu-koshikeey anek roopon main ho sakate hai, parantu paudhon ke samaan isamen jad, pattiyaan ityadi rachanaayen nahin pai jaati hai bhi sookshmjiviyon kii shrenee main aate hai
 Microorganisms like bacteria and viruses are very subtle but their structure is simple
 inke adhyayan main sookshmdarshi yantra kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 After the invention of electron microscope, their study has become even simpler
 electron sookshmdarshi kii aavardhan kshamta saadhaaran yaa yogic sookshmdarshi se hajaaron guna adhik he
 With this, microorganisms are seen to be millions of times larger than the actual size
 jeevanuon ko abhiranjit karne kii vidhiyon kii khoj hone ke baad inaki pahchaan saral ho gai he
 Classification and study of bacteria is done with the help of gram stain
 prayogshaala main sanvardhan dwaara jeevanuon kii colony ugaai jaati he
 The bacteria-colony grown in this way has proved extremely useful in researching bacteria
 adhyayan ke liye sookshmjaiviki ke kshetra ko praayah kai up-kshetron main baanta jaataa he: sookshmjeev sharir kriya vigyaan isamen sookshmjaivik koshikaaye kis prakaar jaivaracinic kriyaayein karatin hai, iskaa adhyayan tathaa sookshmjaivik upaj, sookshmjaivik upapachay evam sookshmjaivik koshika sanrachana sammilit hai
 In microbiological genetics, information about the genes in microorganisms and their cellular functions, how they are organized and regulated, is obtained
 yah shrenee anvik jaiviki ke kshetra se nikatataa se sambandhit he
 Medical microbiology or microbial medicine In this, the role of microorganisms in human diseases is studied
 sookshmjaivik rogajanan evam mahamari vigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he saath hi yah rog vikruti vigyaan evam sharir ke suraksha vigyaan se bhi sambandhit he
 Animal Microbiology Its microorganisms have an important role in veterinary or animal taxonomy
 paryaavaran sookshmjaiviki isamen sookshmjivon ke prakritik paryaavaran / vaataavaran main kriya va vibhed kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he tathaa isamen sookshmjaivik paristhitiki, sookshmjaivikeey-madhyasth poshan chakra, bhusookshmjaiviki, sookshmjaivik vibhed va biorimediation bhi sammilit hai
 Evolutionary microbiology studies the development of microorganisms in this as well as bacterial system and classification
 audyogic sookshmjaiviki isamen audyogic prakriyaaon main sookshmjivon ke anuprayog va upyog kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 For example, industrial fermentation, waste water treatment etc
 yah jaevpraudyogiki vyavsaay kaa nikat sambandhi he
 This area also includes alcoholism, which is an important application of microbiology
 vaayu sookshmjaiviki yah vayuvahit sookshmjivon kaa adhyayan he
 Food microbiology in which food breakdown and food related diseases are studied by microorganisms
 sookshmjivon ko khaadya padaarth utpaadan hetu prayog main laana, jaise prakinwan aadi bhi isamen shaamil he
 In medicinal microbiology, microorganisms that cause contamination in drugs are studied
 maukhik sookshmjaivikimen mukh ke bheetar ke sookshmjivon kaa adhyayan, khaskar jo sookshmjivi dantakshay evam dantaparidhiy rogon ke kaaran hai unka adhyayan kiya jaataa he

 and because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases
 saamaanya Journals vyavsaayik pratishthan Missing language is one of the most endangered languages of India
 yah nishchit rup se khatre main he
 ISO Code: mrg upachaaraarthi kendrit manashchikitsa yaa vyakti-kendrit chikitsa yaa anirdeshaatmak chikitsa maansik upachaar kii ek vidhi he jisamen rogi ko lagaataar sakriy rakhaa jaataa he or bina koi nirdesh die use nirog banane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 In contrast, it is self-preservation in which neither the patient is made dependent on the doctor nor the circumstances before him are interpreted, on the contrary, by indirectly helping the patient to try to mature his cognitive and emotional area so that He could adjust himself to the present and future circumstances
 isamen chikitsak kaa daayitv maatr itnaa hota he ki vah rogi ke liye "swasangrakshan"kii vyavastha kaa uchit prabandh karata rahe kyonki rogi ke samvegatmak kshetra main samaayojan laane ke liye chikitsak kaa sahyog vaanchit hi nahin, aavashyak bhi he
 Nonoperative therapy is very similar to psychoanalysis
 donon main hi chetan-avchetan-str par prastut bhaavana ichchhaaon kii abhivyakti ke liye puri aazaadee rahati he
 The only difference is that in indirect treatment, the patient is kept familiar with the problems of the present, while in psychoanalysis, he is taken towards the memories of the past
 maansik upachaar kii yah vidhi safal rahi he kyonki jaise hi rogi main ek vishisht sujh paidaa hoti he, vah swasth ho jaataa he
 Instructional therapy also has certain drawbacks: kuch vyaktiyon or rogon par iskaa prabhaav nahin hota
 This method is successful only at the higher intellectual level
 vartmaan paristhitiyon se sambhddha samasyaayen hi isse sulajh sakati hai, ateet main viksit manogranthiyon par iskaa prabhaav nahin hota
 Treatment-focused psychiatry is a psychological method of mental illness prevention propounded by Carl Rogers
 rogers kaa swa-vaad prasiddh he jo adhikanshat: upachaar prakriya yaa paristhitiyon se udbhoot pradatton par avlambit he
 Rogers' original fantasies are about self-development, self-knowledge, self-control, familiarity with external and internal experiences, development of understanding, real acceptance of emotions, etc
 vastut: vyakti main vriddhivikas, abhiyojan evam swasthyalabh tathaa swasphoton kii swaabhaavik vritti hoti he
 Mental conflict and emotional excitement inhibit this type of feeling
 in avarodhon kaa nivaaran bhaavon ke prakaashan or unako angikaar karne se sujh ke udai hone se ho jaataa he
 In this method, such an environment is present that the patient remains more and more active
 vah swatantra hokar upachaarak ke sammukh apane bhaavon, ichchhaaon tathaa tanaav sambandhi anubhutiyon kaa abhivyaktikaran kare, uddeshy, prayojan ko samajhe or sangrakshan ke liye duusare par ashrith na rah jaae
 In this, self-preservation or self-sighting is necessary
 upachaarak paroksh rup se, bina hastkshep ke rogi ko vastusthiti kii chetana main keval sahaayta detaa he jisase uske bhavatmak, gyanatmak kshetra main praudhata aae
 He does not instruct, nor does he explain the situation
 is vidhi ke paanch str hai : Assistance of the treatment-seeker: This is the role of active support of the patient
 upachaarak apane haav bhav, rang dhang or baatcheet se prarambh main hi yah spasht kar detaa he ki uske paas rogi kii samasyaon kaa pratyuttar nahin he
 Yes, upon coming in contact, the patient must feel a situation in which he can solve his problems
 bhaavon kii abhivyakti : sahanubhuti kaa vaataavaran paane se rogi ke nishedhaatmak evam virdohi sanvegon kaa, jo abhi tak nichle str par dabe the, pradarshan ho jaataa he
 Similarly, there is also a free release of positive sentiments
 bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti upachaar kaa ek aavashyak ang he
 Without this, prevention of disease is not possible
 antardrushti kaa abhyuday : ek nai drushti se udai hone se rogi apane vaastavik swa ko usee rup main angikaar karata he tathaa vaastavik swa or adarsh swa main saamanjasy laata he
 Positive Attempts: In this state he makes macro plans and is proactive
 sampark kaa samaapan : is avasthaa main rogi ko kisi prakaar kii sahaayta lene kii aavashyaktaa nahin rah jaati
 He becomes a free thinker and a pioneer
 aatmavishvaas ke udai hone se uski vichaardhaara main parivartan aa jaataa he or vah daayitv kaa anubhav karata he
 He does not need the help of the therapist and 'that is enough' - this feeling rises and becomes firm in him
 yadhyapi upachaaraarthi kendrit manashchikitsa upachaar kii utkrisht vidhi he tathaapi kuch aise maansik rog hai jinpar iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Mostly, this treatment method proves to be highly beneficial when there is mental and general mental debility

 This method is mostly successful on those whose intellectual level is high

 According to Srinivas, Sanskritization is not only an adoption of new practices and habits, but it also comes to be interviewed with new ideas and values existing in Sanskrit

 Srinivas wrote in the book: "the caste system is far from a rigid system in which the position of each component caste is fixed for all time
 Movement has always been possible, and especially in the middle regions of the hierarchy
 a caste was able, in a generation or two, to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism, and by Sanskritizing its ritual and pantheon
 In short, it took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins, and adoption of the Brahminic way of life by a low caste seems to have been frequent, though theoretically forbidden
 This process has been called 'sanskritization' in this book, in preference to 'brahminization', as certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the two other 'twice-born' castes
" This book then challenged the ongoing idea that caste is a firm and unchanging institution

 Similarly, there are innumerable facts that prove that Darul Uloom Deoband, even after the freedom struggle, the country has been reading the text of love like India got independence in 1947, but at the same time hatred like transfer and partition of population
 The time of bitter experience also came, but the ideology of Darul Uloom did not bother

 The spectrum obtained from these are of two types - line spectrum and continuous spectrum
 rekha spectrum target ke tal kaa lakshanik spectrum hota he
 The continuous spectrum consists of quantities of each frequency of a finite region

 If continuous x rays are allowed to pass through a thin sheet of metal before moving to the spectrometer, it absorbs its characteristic frequencies and gives us the absorption spectrum

 In the general spectroscope, we obtain only such spectrum by excitation of the electrons adjacent to the atoms
 eks-kirnon se sambhddha urja kaa maan bahut adhik hota he
 Therefore, when they collide with the atoms of a substance, or when high-energy electrons collide with the atoms, the electrons in the internal orbitals of the atom go out
 unako sthanapann karne ke liye anya kakshaon se electron jate hai
 The transition of these electrons emits X-radiation and gives a linear spectrum

 Very faint and extremely proud Modenon angrily told the major construction entrepreneur, "lamborghini, maybe you are able to drive a tractor correctly, but you will never be able to handle a Ferrari properly
" The consequences of Enzo Ferrari's derogatory remarks about Lamborghini were serious
 lemborgini ne baad main kaha ki us samay unhonen vichaar kiya ki yadi anzo pheraari, yaa koi or, unhen ek acchhee car bana kar nahin de saktaa, to ve aasaani se aisi car apane liye bana sakate hai
 The leading entrepreneur in tractor manufacturing felt that Ferrari cars did not have the qualities of a superior grand passenger car
 lemborgini kaa maananaa tha ki aisi car ko behatar str, roide quality or interior se samjhauta kiye bina, acha pradarshan karnaa chahie
 Believing that they too could outperform the legendary Ferrari, Lamborghini and his workers opened one of their 250gts at the tractor factory by returning to Peeva di Santo and working on it

 Some argue that Lamborghini entered the automobile trade only to show competitors Ferrari that they could build a car better than his prized horse Marca cars, and faster, better-built and more powerful than the Marnello camp

 This was the beginning of a historic rivalry: Ferruccio and Enzo never spoke again

 The construction site, being in the midst of Italy's automobile industry, meant that Lamborghini's activities had easy access to machine shops, coachbuilders, and experienced workers in the automotive industry

 Bizzarini was a part of the so-called "gang of Five" which was part of a mass exodus from Ferrari in 1961 after developing the famous 250 GTO
 lemborgini ne use swatantra rup main kaam par rakhaa tha or use ek V12 ingine dizin karne ke liye kaha jo pheraari 3 litre power plant jitna bada ho, lekin pheraari ke anupyukt res ingine ke vipareet, shuru se hi ek sadak car main istemaal ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya ho
 Bizarini was to be paid a L45 lakh for this work, and a bonus on each unit of brake horsepower the engine could generate more than the Ferrari version

 Bizzarini built an engine using dry-sump lubrication that produced its maximum horsepower at 9,800 rpm, but hardly worth the engine of a road-going car

 The feud resulted in a rift in Lamborghini and Bizzarini's relationship and he was not fully compensated for his work until the courts ordered Lamborghini to do so
 lemborgini ke paas ab ek ingine tha, lekin ise feet karne ke liye ek vaahan kii aavashyaktaa thi
 By 1963, he had formed a team of people with Gian Paulo Dallara, the most skilled chassis engineer of the post-war era
 Having worked with Ferrari and Maserati, Dallara was appointed in charge of building Lamborghini's car

 Ferruccio rejected high names such as Vinale, Ghiya, Bertone and Pininfarina, and instead hired relatively unknown designer Franco Scalione to design the car

 Gian Paolo Dallara took on the challenge of improving the Vizarini's V12 design, increased the displacement to 3
9-liters, and increased the power to 320 bhp at 6500 rpm
 The engine was first fitted inside a 350GT chassis, known as the 'interim 400GT' car, and produced 23 units
 1966 tak, 350GT kaa ek lambaa 2+2 sanskaran viksit kiya gaya tathaa khuli jagah vaali 400GT kaa geneva auto sho main anaavaran kiya gaya
 The car was successful and sold a total of 250 units, enabling Lamborghini to increase the number of workers at its factory to 170
 Two prototype cars based on the 400GT were built by Zagato Coachworks in Turin
 Despite the popularity of the designs, Ferruccio insisted on working with his factory and workers, rather than having the design and engineering work done externally

 During 1965, Dallara, Stanzani and Wallace spent their time developing a prototype called the P400
 Engineers thought of making a road car, which also has racing features
 a car that can win on the track and can be driven on the road by enthusiasts

 Unlike the previous Lamborghini car, its V12 was also exceptional which was effectively connected to the transmission and differential due to lack of space

 The favorable response in Geneva meant that the P400 was to go into production by next year under the name Miura

 Due to the advancement in automobiles and other businesses, Ferruccio Lamborghini's life had reached a high level
 1966 ke ant tak, saint agata factory main karmchaariyon kii sankhya 300 tak pahunch gayi thi
 In 1967, a lot of money was deposited by buyers eager to start Miura's development program

 Also Giorgio Neri and Luciano Bonacini of Neri and Bonacini coach builders in Modena, who were asked to build the concept, created the Monza 400GT
 Lamborghini disapproved of the coachbuilders' efforts, rejecting both cars
 badhati vittiya kathinaaiyon ke maddenzar, touring ne baad main us saal factory band kar di
 Ferruccio was still looking for the 400GT option and sought the help of Bertone designer Mario Marazzi, who had previously worked in touring
 Together with Lamborghini's engineers, the coachbuilder built a four-seater marzal
 The chassis was originally a Miura-based long version and one engine had six cylinders half of the V12 design

 Despite its distinctive design, Ferruccio once again rejected it as an alternative to the 400GT

 The resulting car, the Islero 400GT, was mostly a modified version of the 400GT and not the four-seater as Ferruccio wanted

 But Lamborghini was also against the creation of its prototype, his idea of his mission being: "I like to build flawless GT cars - which are quite simple, traditional but very good - not a technical bomb

 The Miura's power was increased, the Islero was further improved, and the Espada's comfort and performance improvements accelerated to 100 miles / hour Islero was to be replaced by the Jarama 400GT, which is named after the similarly named race track Named after an area in Spain which is famous for bull fighting, rather than keeping

 Changes in tax laws and a willingness to fully utilize a factory's production capacity meant that the Italian automaker made changes like Ferrari and developed a small V8 power-powered 2 + 2 car with its Dino 246 and Porsche 911
 The name was named after another fighting bull breed Urraco
