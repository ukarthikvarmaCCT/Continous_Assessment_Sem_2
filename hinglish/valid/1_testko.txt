 Born on 7 September 1933 in Ahmedabad, Ila Bhatt spent her childhood in Surat city where her father Sumat Bhatt was a successful lawyer

 Ila Bhatt's family members also participated in India's freedom struggle
 unke naanaa mahatma gandhi ke namak satyagrah main shaamil the or iske liye jail bhi gayi the
 In 1952 Ila graduated in Arts from MTB College, Surat and then completed law in 1954 from Ahmedabad where she was also awarded a Gold Medal for her work on Hindu Law
 kuch dinon ke liye unhone shrimati nathibai damodar thakare mahila vishvavidhyalay, mumbai main angrezi padhaane kaa kaam kiya

 ila bhatta ne dekha ki ye sari mahilaayein khuli sadak par rahane ko majaboor hai or inaki mazaduri behad kam he
 He wrote on this subject in local newspapers
 kapadaa vyapaariyon ne javaabi lekh prakashit karke ila bhatta ke saare aaropon ko kaarij kar diya or mahila kuliyon ko uchit mazaduri dene kaa daawa kiya
 Ila Bhatt got many copies of the articles of the traders and distributed them to the women porters so that they asked the traders for the wages printed in the newspaper

 He offered talks to Ila Bhatt
 disambar, 1971 main isi baithak ke liye sau mahila mazdoor jutin or seva sanghathan kaa janm hua
 When there was an idea to register the service as a labor organization, the Labor Department flatly refused
 tark yah tha ki shramik sanghathan bananaa he to pehle maalik kaa naam bataaya jaae jahaan ye log naukari par he
 All members of the service were unorganized women laborers
 inke paas koi niyamit naukari nahin thi
 Only after a long debate did the service become a registered labor organization
 1981 main aarakshan ke virodh main ucch jatiyon ne pichhadi jati ke logon ke saath marpet kii
 The service strongly opposed the violence against backward and scheduled castes, while the textile workers union remained silent

 According to Ila Bhatt, this removal proved to be a boon
 iske baad seva nari andolan, mazdoor andolan va sahakaarita andolan kaa sangam ban gayi
 The main goal of Ila Bhatt's organization service is to connect women with full employment
 sampoorn rojgaar kaa matlab keval naukari nahin; balki naukari ke saath khaadya-suraksha or saamaajik suraksha bhi he
 This means engaging workers in activities that make them self-reliant

 Due to the ownership of this water, she also became the owner of the land

 Bird flu or bird influenza or bird flu is a viral disease
 yah vishaanu jise influenza e yaa tip e vishaanu kehete hai, aam taur me pakshiyon main paaya jaataa he, lekin kabhi kabhi yah maanav sahit anya kai stanadharion ko bhi sankramit kar saktaa he, jab yah maanav ko sankramit karata he to ise influenza kaha jaataa he
 There are several types of influenza A, which were first detected in a bird in Italy in 1878
 is beemaari ko alag se pahchaanane ke liye koi khaas lakshan nahin hote hai or iske adhiktar prakaaro me kai kamjor lakshan jaise saans lene me kathinaayee, jo aam zukam kaa bhi ek lakshan he, paye jate hai
 Some types of influenza a infection are capable of killing birds and some for humans and other mammals
 1918 / 1919 me failaa influenza jise spanish flu kaha gaya tha, lagbhag 5 se 10 karod logon kii mrityu ke liye uttaradaayi tha
 Another variant, known as Asian flu, was responsible for the deaths of about 1 million people in 1957, and another Hong Kong flu that killed one million people in 1968
 influenza e kaa ek upaprakaar H5N1 ne 1997 main honkong main chah logon ko maar daalaa, par 2003 ke baad se china main iskaa prakope nahin dekha gaya
 By mid-2005, it predominantly spread to South East Asia, but has since spread to Africa and parts of Europe
 yah ab tak lakhon pakshiyon ko maar chukaa he or iske prasar ko simit karne ke liye karodon anya pakshiyon ko bhi maaraa ja chukaa he
 Till now it is mainly a bird disease and very few humans have been infected by it
 H5N1 ke bare main yah chintaa kaa vishay yah he ki yah lagaataar bahut tej gati se fail rahaa he or yah kabhi bhi ek mahamari kaa rup dhaaran kar lakhon logon kii jaan le saktaa he
 Governments around the world are spending billions of dollars to tackle this problem

 Even after decades of its development, India is still far behind in its exports due to internal fault or spongy tissue problem
 iske falswarup desh ke rajasav main baari ghaataa hota he
 This problem has remained the first since 1998
 taakirk rup se spji tissue bahay karkon,jaise taapmaana,svahak taap aadi ke kaaran nahin hoti,kyonki ye swasth fal env spji tissue se prakopit fal ke liye alag-alag nahin hote,jiskaa samaan pushp-gucchh par lagaataar nirikshaan kiya gaya
 The intensity of the spongy tissue is related to the maturation of the fruit and is caused by a lack of nutrients, especially calcium and boron
 Collecting occurs not in the absence of supply of nutrients at the time of growth
 spji tissue pushp-gucchh main lagaanevaale falon kii skhya ke anupaat main hoti he,jisamen vikaas ke dauraan falon kii aantarik pratispardhaa kii sbhaavna dikhti hai
 Genetically a weak seed will not survive the competition and although the fruit looks physically attached to the tree, it is separated from the main tree either structurally or functionally, possibly to prevent shedding unlike the stems
 is
 beej ke poshak tatwon kii aavashyaktaa kii,daata ped dwara nabhika par lagi vrintika ke madhyam se ,purti kii jaati he
 When it is difficult to supply directly from the tree during its development, the seeds are mid-fruit mural dependent and take in the spontaneity from any place near the kernel, causing nutrient deficiencies and drying the tissue
 is
 ujdd beej,jaisaa ki aam kaa,maadaa-paudhe par viksit hone par bhi purv-ankuran prarb karadete hai or sthayitv hetu ankuran-ksham bane rahane ke liye unako lagaataar nami kii awashyaktaa hoti hai
 The lack of seed conduction of seed and its donor tree allows developmentally significant numbers of significant events to occur, which alters the function of the embryo in germination; germination rejects the function of focal development
 isliye karyiki rup se sakriy bhrun,ucch praathamikatawaale vilay-grat hone ke kaaran or nabhik par sthit vrantika ke madhyam se fal ke goodedaar bhaag se sadhanon ko nikaalane main sakasham hone ke kaaran,spji tissue banane ko prerit karata he
 The spongy tissue is mostly a local disorder and definitely occurs on the surface of the kernel
 iske atirikt yah,spji tissue se prakopit kuch falon main dikhaai de rahi udbhij-bijadharita ke saath,spji tissue ke liye beej kii pramukh bhoomika par shka karne ko badaawa detaa hai
 a detailed examination of the specimen and systematic inspection revealed that spongy tissue and seed germination were a direct affection of alteration
 karyiki env jaivaracinic adhyayanon ne is pariklpana ko manyata di or spji tissue ke liye beej ke kaaran banne kii nishkarshi saboot pradaan kiya
 Radiotracer titium studies have clearly shown greater water storage in seeds from spongy tissue-infested fruit pulp
 aam ke guthli ghun se prakopit falon main spji tissue ke abhaav ne beej kii sidhi bhoomika k ek thos swaabhaavik saboot diya ki ghun keval beej ko hi khaataa he
 a comparative study of Alfonso and Totapuri mangoes helped to understand the importance of the calyx on the nucleus in the spongy tissue infestation in Alfonso
 padap anuvanshik ssadhano ke upyog se beej kii chayapachayee kriya main badlaav karne ke dawaara spji tissue ke niyaman ne na keval beej kii bhoomika ko sabit kiya varan 'alphonso'main is vikaar ke niytran ke liye nai aashaaen pradaan kii / beej ke chayapachay kaa nimna-viniman is kism main spji tissue ko rokane ke liye ek vyaavhaarya niti dikhti hai / spji tissue ko rokane ke liye packlobutrazol ke prayog ne ek amuly acadmik antaradrushti pradaan kii,lekin niryaat-pratibdh or swasthya ke liye hanikaarak hone ke kaaran iske vyaavhaarik prayog main seemayen hai
 Therefore some eco-friendly blends were developed and their efficacy in preventing spongy tissue was evaluated in the Indian horticultural plantation plantations and in the farmers of the Konkan region of Maharashtra, with good results
 kisaanon se praapt pratikriya ke aadhaar par varsh 2010 ke prakshetra ke behatar paryaavaran-anukool mishrn ko or sudhara tathaa iskaa alphonso niryaat suvidha,ratnagiri,maharashtra krishi vipanan board,pune ke sahyog se varsh 2011 ke dauraan konkn kshetra ke ratnagiri or sindhudurg jilon ke 20 kisaanon ke bagnon main parikshan kiya gaya
 This advanced eco-friendly blends not only prevented spongy tissue hundred percent varna, but also increased many parameters of quality including fruit size
 kuch kisaanon ne paaya ki ped main hi pake falon main bhi spji tissue bilkul nahin thi,jo ek asaadhaaran uplabdhi he
 Nevertheless, the farmers want this amendment to be further amended to make it effective enough to prevent spongy tissue from the same pre-sprinkling of the fruit at up to 60% of its ripe stage
 kisaanon ne shikaayat kii ki adhikansh falon kii vrudhdi env vikaas nirdhaarit karyikeey avasthaa se pehle mishran ke spark main aane se prabhavit hue
 Work to resolve both these issues is in progress

 Hindi Movement In India, there are special efforts to bring Hindi and Devanagari in various social fields
 yah bharatendu harishchandr ke samay armbh hua
 Litterateurs and social workers had a special contribution in this movement
 bharatendu ke samay main hindi kii sthiti badi vikat ho gayi thi
 The British used to promote the minorities according to their 'divide and rule' policy
 ve hindi ke raah main tarah-tarah ke rode atakaate the
 Urdu-loving litterateurs considered the new Hindi a great danger for themselves
 iske atirikt hindi ke roodhiwaadee sahityakar puraani kavy-paramparaon se chipke hue the
 He was indifferent to the development of prose in modern Hindi
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki musalamaanon ke bharat aane se nayi bhashaa 'urdu' kaa janm hua
 It's not like this
 musalamaanon ke bharat aane se kisi nayi bhashaa kaa janm nahin hua
 No new language is born by approaching two religions
 musalamaanon ne europe par bhi akraman kiya tha or saikadon varshon tak unase ladaai kii thi kintu vahaan kisi nai bhashaa kaa janm nahin hua
 The entry of Muslims into India started from the eighth century but 'urdu' came to the end of the eighteenth century and the boycott of the words of the dialects of the dialects came at a time when the British grip on India was getting stronger
 kisi ek hi dharm ke maanane vaale ek hi bhashaa bolen yah bhi aavashyak nahin
 Arab, Iran, Turkey are the three Muslim countries, but the languages of the three are not only different, but belong to three different families
 jab ham yah vichaar karen ki bharat main musalamaanon ke aane se vahaan kii bhashaaon evam samskruti main kya parivartan hue, to ye prashn avashya poochna chaiye - ye musalmaan kahan ke nivasee the? inaki maatrubhaasha kya thi? dilli main shashan karne vaale musalmaan na irani the na arab
 The separation of Hindi from Urdu was necessary because Urdu had deliberately separated itself from the tradition of native words used by Kabir, Tulsi, Sur, Meera, Rasakhan etc
 
 There are two aspects of Matrukat - one is left with many popular words called 'ganwaru', and the other is borrowed only from arabic-persian for high cultural vocabulary
 bangala, marathi, telugu ke vipareet urdu main sanskrit kaa tiraskaar hota rahaa
 All the Arabic words in Urdu were not included in the rule of the Muslims as they came under the British rule
 'urdu alag jabaan he', 'majahab ke aadhaar par bhi comen banatin hai' - ye vichaar angreji raaj main hi prachaarit kiye gayi, musalamaanon ke shasankaal main nahin
 How would the people of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar meet their cultural needs? Leaving or leaving the leaks of all Indian languages? By adopting the Persian script, considering the continuation of matrukat and boycotting Sanskrit vocabulary? yadi patna, dilli, ujjain ke vishaal trikon main hindi aandolan na chalaaya jaataa; yadi yahan farsi-lipi or farsi-arabi ke shisht shabd lene kii niti ko maan liya jaataa to yah niti keval yahan kii janata ke liye hi nahin, varan samast desh kii janata ke liye ghaatak hota
 Instead of going ahead with Bangla, Marathi and Telugu, the vast Hindi-speaking region would push them back, hindering their progress, stopping their development
 bharatendu kaa yah ugantakaari mahatv he ki unhone apane pradesh ke saanskrithik aavashyaktaaon ko pahachaanaa; unhone hindi ke liye sangharsh kiya; saamaajik-saanskrithik jivan main uskaa vyavhaar sudruth kiya; matarukat kaa silsilaa khatm karke unhone hindi ko usee maarg pabadhane kii prerana di jis par bangala, marathi, telugu aadi pehle se hi bad raheen thim
 The development of Hindi was necessary and inevitable for our national life
 vishaal hindi pradesh kaa saanskrithik vikaas urdu ke madhyam se sambhav na tha
 In 1928, Khwaja Hasan Nizami translated the Quran into Hindi, he told in the role that most Muslims of North India know Hindi, not Urdu
 bharatendu ne jo hindi aandolan chalaaya vah musalamaanon ke liye bhi upyogi tha na keval hinduon ke liye; thik usee tarah jaise bankimachandra chattopadhyaay or rabindranath thakur kii bangala-seva hindu-musalmaan sabake liye thi
 Due to the Hindi movement- luftfaafaa natsi germany kaal main germany kii vayusena thi
 In 1845, Gustav Kirchhoff gave two rules regarding voltage and current in electric circuits
 ye dono niyam sanyukt rup se kirchof ke paripath ke niyam kehalaate hai
 These rules are actually different forms of charge protection and energy conservation rules for electric circuits
 ye niyam vaidyut ejiniyari se sambandhit gananaaon ke aadhaar hai or bahutayat main prayog hote hai
 Both of these rules can be derived directly from Maxwell's equations, but history has it that Kirchhoff proposed them before Maxwell
 is niyam ko 'kirchof kaa sandhi niyam', 'kirchof kaa bindu niyam', 'kirchof kaa jankson kaa niyam' or kirchof kaa pratham niyam bhi kehete hai
 n is the total number of stream-branches connected to a node
 yah niyam samishra dhaaraon ke liye bhi satya he
 This rule is based on the law of conservation of charge
 is niyam ko 'kirchof kaa dwitiya niyam', kirchof kaa loop kaa niyam bhi kehete hai
 meaning, yahan, n loop main sthit kuch vibhavantaron kii sankhya ke baraabar he
 These voltages can also be complex numbers
 yah niyam urja sangrakshan ke niyam par aadhaarit he
 The power circuit shown in front has 2 voltage sources and 3 resistors
 tathaa, According to Kirchhoff's first law we can write that ab band paripath s1 main kirchof ke dwitiya niyam ke anusaar, Similarly according to Kirchhoff's Second Law in closed circuit s1, is prakaar hamen i 1 , i 2 , i 3 { \ displaystyle i_{1},i_{2},i_{3}} main nimnlikhit raikhik sameekaran praapt hue- You can also write them as follows- ab The following solution is obtained by placing- dhyaan dijiye ki i 3 { \ displaystyle i_{3}} kaa chihn rinatmak he, jiskaa matlab yah he ki vastav main i 3 { \ displaystyle i_{3}} kii disha chitra main dikhaayi gayi disha ke ulti disha main he
