 bhashavigyaan main 'akshar' yaa shabdaansh dhvaniyon kii sangathit ikai ko kehete hai
 Any word can be spoken by breaking it into fractions and syllables are the parts of the word that cannot be made any shorter, otherwise the sounds of the word are changed
 udhaahrantah 'achaanak' shabd ke teen shabdaansh hai - 'a', 'chaa' or 'nak'
 If 'a-cha-nak' is spoken intermittently, the three syllables of the word can be seen fragmentarily but the pronunciation of the word seems to be correct
 agar 'nak' ko aage todaa jaae to shabd kii dhvaniyaan galat ho jaatin hai - 'a-chaa-na-k'
 is shabd ko 'a-chaan-k' bhi nahin bolaa jaataa kyonki is se bhi uccharan galat ho jaataa he
 Some short words have the same syllable, such as 'in', 'ear', 'hand', 'walk' and 'ja'
 Some words have two syllables, such as 'walker', food, handkerchief and vegetable
 kuch main teen yaa us se bhi adhik shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'mahatvapurn' or 'antarrashtriya' 
 The word Akshar means - 'which cannot happen, nor can be destroyed'
 iskaa prayog pehle 'vaani' yaa 'vaak' ke liye evam shabdaansh ke liye hota tha
 The letter continued to be used for 'varna' as well
 yahi kaaran he ki lipi sanketon dwaara vyakt varnon ke liye bhi aaj 'akshar' shabd kaa prayog saamaanya jan karte hai
 Scientific study of the language has given the letter the meaning of English 'syllable', in which vowels, vowels and consonants, including vowels or consonant sounds with reminders, are considered
 ek hi aghat yaa bal main boli jane vaali dhwani yaa dhwani samudaay kii ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he
 The basis of unit separation is the vowel or vowel consonant
 vyanjan dhwani kisi uccharan main swar kaa purv yaa par ang banakar hi aati he
 Astu, the vowel in the letter is the spine
 akshar se swar ko na to pruthak hi kiya ja saktaa he or na bina swar yaa swararat vyanjan ke akshar kaa nirmaan hi sambhav he
 If the consonant is like a pearl in pronunciation, the vowel is like a thread
 yadi swar shashakt samraat he to vyanjan ashakt raja
 It is on this basis that a letter is often considered synonymous with vowels, but it is not so, yet vowels have great importance in letter formation
 katipay bhashaaon main vyanjan dhvaniyaan bhi akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 In English, consonant sounds like Na, Su and l are also pronounced vowrat and help in syllable formation like vowel sounds
 angreji silabal ke liye hindi main akshar shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma has used the word 'swarik' for syllable
 
 Since the word alphabet has been used for many meanings in the history of language and grammar, its use in the meaning of syllable leads to the possibility of confusion
 shabd ke uccharan main jis dhwani par shikharata yaa ucchata hoti he vahi akshar yaa silabal hota he, jaise haath main aa dhwani par
 This word has a letter
 'akalpit' shabd main teen akshar hai - a, kal, pit ; aazaadee main teen - aa ja di; arthath shabd main jahaan jahaan swar ke uccharan kii pruthakta pai jaae vahaan-vahaan akshar kii pruthakta hoti he
 When considered from the point of view of sound production, the unit of pleural circulation is called syllable or vocal, which has the same sound
 sharir rachana kii drushti se akshar yaa swarik ko phuffus spandan bhi kah sakate hai, jiskaa uccharan dhwani tantra main avarodhan hota he
 When the component is highest in the movement letter at the time of pronunciation of the sound block or the lowest sound group, then that sound is alphabetic
 swar dhvaniyaan bahudhaa aksharvat uccharit hoti he evam vyanjan dhvaniyaan kvachit
 The absolutely separate unit of lexical pronunciation is called a letter, as kisi shabd main aksharon kii sankhya is baat par katai nirbhar nahin karti ki usamen kitni dhvaniyaan hai, balki is baat par ki shabd kaa uccharan kitne aghat yaa jatke main hota he arthath shabd main kitni avyavhit dhwani ikaiyaan hai
 In addition to the head sound used in the letter, the remaining sounds are called ‘aksharang’ or ‘gahvar sound’
 udhaaharan ke liye 'chaar' main ek akshar he jisamen aa sheersh dhwani tathaa c evam r gahvar dhvaniyaan hai
 In any syllable there is a 'syllabus center', which is always the vowel character and other characters are found around it which can be consonants and also vowels
 The syllable center of the syllable 'ear' is the vowel of 'aa', from which the letters 'a' and 'n' come later

 But this role also has moral, religious and other social codes

 The first thing is that the law is made by the government but in society it is applied equally to all

 Liberalism theory makes it clear what should be the methods of making and enforcing the law
 udaahranarth, kanoon nirvaachit vidhikrttaaon dwaara aapasi vichaar-vimarsh ke dwaara kiya janaa chahie
 Secondly, no law can be enforced from the previous date, because in that case it will punish the citizens for the works which were done according to the then law

 The Monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is the constitutional monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
 saint vincent or grenadins ke ekadhidaruk ko saint vincent or grenadins or united kingdom samet kul 15 prajabhumiyon, kaa sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler has been Queen Elizabeth II since 6 February 1952
 anya rashtramandal deshon ke saamaan hi saint vincent or grenadins kii raajnneetik vyavastha westminster pranali par aadhaarit he, jisamen rashtrapramukh kaa pad nammaatr hota he, or vaastavik prashasnic shaktiyaan shashanpramukh par nihit hote hai
 St
 Vincent and the Grenadines is theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of St
 Vincent and the Grenadines is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all the constitutional powers of the Governor, as his representative, the governor-general of St
 Vincent and the Grenadines 
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " saint vincent or grenadins kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " saint vincent or grenadins ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in St
 Vincent and the Grenadines dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world
 dhire-dhire in upniveshon ko apni prashasan par samprabhutaa pradaan kar di gai, or westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara in saare rajyon ko rashtramandal ke andar, purnatah samaan pad de diya gaya tha
 Those countries which considered the former colony, the British ruler, as their ruler even today, are called Commonwealth of Nations or Commonwealth Territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhitvatmak kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions

 The rules related to succession can be changed only by the Parliamentary Act, which is mandatory to be passed with the approval of all subjects
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 No successor of Singhasana can voluntarily renounce his succession
 saint vincent or grenadins kii sarkaar samprabhu, rajpariwaar yaa desh ke baahar sthit shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav ke samarthan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii aarthik sahaayta nahin pradaan karti he
 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general
 jabaki rajnatik-shaktiyon kaa abhyay governor-general dwaara sarkaar or apane mantriyon kii salaah or vinirdeshon par hi karte hai

 unhone yah bhi pataa lagaaya ki utsarjan spectrum kii niharikaayen lagbhag hameshaa B1 yaa usase adhik garm se judy rahati hai, jabaki satat spectra yukt niharikaayen apekshaakrit thande taron ke saath prakat hoti hai
 Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell conclude that the nebulae surrounding the hot stars are changing in some way
 anek niharikaon kaa gathan antartaarkeey madhyam main gas ke aapasi gurutvkarshan kii vajah se hota he
 Due to the constriction of matter under its own weight, many massive stars can be formed in the center and their ultraviolet light ionizes the surrounding gases and makes them visible on light waves
 rojet nebyal or pelicon nebyal is prakaar kii niharikaon ke udhaaharan hai
 The size of these types of nebulae, known as the HII region, depends on the size of the actual clouds of gas
 yahi vah jagah hai jahaan sitaron kaa gathan hota he
 The stars formed from it are sometimes referred to as a young, loose cluster
 kuch niharikaon kaa gathan supernova main honevaale visphot arthath vishaal or alp-jivi taron ke ant ke parinamswarup hota he
 The material disintegrated by the explosion of a supernova is ionized by energy and this causes the formation of a solid object to be formed
 vrish taramandal kaa craib nebyal iskaa sravshreshth udhaaharan he
 In the year 1054 a supernova incident was recorded and marked as SN1054
 visphot ke baad nirmit thos vastu craib nebyal ke kendra main sthit he or yah ek neutron star he
 Other nebulae may constitute planetary nebulae
 prithvi ke suraj kii tarah, yah lo-maas arthath dravyaman taare ke jivan kaa antim charan he
 Stars with 8–10 solar masses develop as red demon stars and gradually lose their deafening layer during pulsing in their atmosphere
 jab ek tara paryaapt saamagree kho detaa he, tab iskaa taapmaana badhata he or isse utsarjit parabangnee vikiran iske dwaara aasapaas phenke hue nebyal ko ynit kar saktaa he
 The nebula contains 97% hydrogen and 3% helium, including residual content
 is charan kaa mukhya lakshya santulan praapt karnaa he
 The nebulae are classified into four major groups
 pehle gallexion or gol taragucchon ko bhinn prakaar kii niharikayen samajha jaataa tha
 Spherical nebulae were used to explain the spherical structure of galaxies
 is vargeekaran main badal jaisi sabhi gyaat sanrachanaayen shaamil nahin hai
 One example of which is the herbig-haro object
 sitaron ke paas kii visarit niharikaayen pratibimb niharika kaa udhaaharan hai
 Most nebulae can be called diffuse nebulae, which means they are elaborate and do not fall within the limits of any common definition
 dikhaai dene yogya roshni main in niharikaon ko utsarjan niharika or pratibimb niharikaamein vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, jo is baat par aadhaarit he ki hamen dikhaai denevaale prakaash kii rachana kis tarah hui he
 The emission nebula consists of imported gases, which form a blurred line of emission
 in utsarjan niharikaon ko aksar HII kshetra kaha jaataa he, "HII" shabd kaa upyog vyavsaayik khagol vigyaan main aksar ynit hydrogen ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Compared to emission nebulae, reflection nebulae themselves do not form sufficient visible light lines, but rather reflect the light of their surrounding stars
 andhri yaa gahari niharikaayen visarit niharikaon jaisi hi hai, lekin unhen unke dwaara utsarjit yaa prativimbit prakaash dwaara nahin dekha ja saktaa
 iske bajaae, unhen dur ke taron yaa utsarjan niharikaon ke saamne ke gahare badalon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Although these nebulae appear differently on light waves, they are bright sources of emission on all infrared or infrared waves
 yah utsarjan mukhyatah niharikaon ke bheetar kii dhul se aata he
 Planetary nebulae are nebulae formed from a gas-rich shell emanating from a low-moss asymptomatic massive branch star when it turns into a white dwarf
 ye niharikaayen, dhundhale utsarjan yukt utsarjit niharikaayen hai jo sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon jaisi hoti hai
 Technically, these are HII regions because most will be hydrogen ionized
 haalanki, grahon kii niharikaayen adhik ghani evam sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon kii apeksha adhik thos hoti hai
 Planetary nebulae have been given this name because the first astronomers who studied these objects thought that nebulae resembled the planets or discs of the planets, however, they are not related to planets
 ek proto planetary nebyal ek khagoleey vastu he, jo bhootpurv ananthasparshi vishaal shakha kii sthiti or uske baad ke grahon kii niharika ke charan ke bich ek taare ke twarit taarakeey kramik vikaas kaa alpakaaleen prakaran he
 a PPN emits strong infrared radiation and is a reflection nebula
 ek PPN ke grahon kii niharika banane ke vaastavik bindu ko kendriya sitare ke taapmaana dwaara paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 a supernova occurs when a high-moss star reaches the end of its life
 jab sitare ke mul yaa centre main parmaanu sanlayan band ho jaataa he, tab sitara vighatit ho jaataa he
 The leaking gas either rebounds or becomes so hot that it spreads out from the center and causes an explosion of stars
 gas kaa failaa hua khol, ek vishesh prakaar ke visarit niharika supernova avshesh kii rachana karata he
 Although most of the light and X-ray emission of the supernova residue originates from ionized gas, the bulk of the radio emission is non-thermal emission known as synchrotron emission
 yah utsarjan chumbakeey kshetron main dolyman ucch-veg yukt electronon se utpann hota he
 The Canary Islands are a group of islands controlled by Spain that lie in the dark ocean beyond the northwest end of Africa
 prashasnic drushti se yah spain kaa ek swytt samudaay he, jo lagbhag ek rajya jaisaa darja rakhata he
 The islands come in this archipelago: Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Feuerteventura, Lancerote, La Palma, La Gomera, La Eiero, La Graciosa, Allegransa, Montanya Clara, Roque del Este, Roque dall Oeste and Isla de Lobos

 a volcano named Pico del Teidee is located on Tenerife, which is the third largest volcano in the world

 When the people of Europe reached these islands, they found some tribal settlers here, who came to be called "guanche"
 yah abhi agyaat he ki yah log in dwipon par kaise pahunche or inkaa itihaas kya tha
 Genetics and linguistic studies have shown that some Guanche people were related to barbarians living in North Africa

 Propaganda refers to all the information that any person or organization transmits to influence the opinion and behavior of a large mass community
 sabase prabhavi adhiprachaar vah hota he jisaki saamagree praayah purnatah satya hoti he kintu usamen thodi maatra asaty, ardhsaty yaa taarkik dosha se purna kathan kii bhi ho
 There are many methods of propaganda
 dushprachaar kaa uddeshy soochna dene ke bajaay logon ke vyavhaar or raay ko prabhavit karnaa hota he
 Propaganda literally means propaganda, propaganda or propaganda in Hindi
 propaganda kisi vishesh uddeshy se, vishesh taur se raajnneetik uddeshy ke tahat, kisi vichaar or najariye ko failaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 But its foundation usually does not depend on truth
 propaganda kii shuruyaat yuddh ke dauraan dushman kii sena ko naitik rup se parajeet karne ke liye ek afawaah ke rup main hui thi
 Then it is mentioned that in 1622, the fifteenth Pope Gregory took over the propaganda work against the Protestant Reforms in the Vatican
 propaganda kii chhavi nakaaratmak us samay bani jab pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan british sarkaar ne apane raajnneetik hiton ke patr main vyavasthit rup se propaganda kiya
 Later, it was also used for campaigning
 prarambh main ise raajnneetik partiyon ke chunaav-prachaar ke dauraan pratyaashee ke hit main samarthan khinchne ke liye istemaal hota tha
 Subsequently, considering its usefulness, it expanded and became a part of advertising
 vigyaapan ke saath judane par propaganda main sakaaratmak paksh bhi aayaa
 He began to play the role of the bearer of a pleasant feeling that touched emotions and became creative in a particular context
 propaganda dwaara uplabdh karaayi gayi soochna kaa aadhaar aitihaasik rup se sakaaratmak na hokar hameshaa se hi nakaaratmak rahaa he
 The information given through it is often one-sided and misleading in nature
 propaganda kaa upyog raajnneetik kaarnon se kisi drushtikon-vishesh ko badhaava dene ke liye shuru kiya gaya tha
 Today the pane of propaganda has become very widespread and it is deliberately being used to spread negative information about a person, institution, nation, product or any political party
 propaganda kaa doosraa paksh yah he ki ise ek vishesh prakaar ke sandesh ke rup main bhi dekha jaataa he
 In the form of a message that is propagated through a slogan etc
 to propagate a particular culture, philosophy, idea or opinion in the market and society
 yuddh ke dauraan jhooth ko sach sabit karne ke liye propaganda kaa upyog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 America is considered the largest user of this propaganda
 vah yuddh ke dauraan hameshaa aisi khabar failaata he ki vah maanavtaa kii raksha or aatankwaad se ladane ke liye yuddh kar rahaa he, jabaki uskaa makasad kuch or hota he
 The biggest example of this is seen in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan in the last two decades
 america hameshaa yah bataata rahaa ki aatankwaad se ladane ke liye aisa karnaa zaruri tha jabaki sachai yah thi ki vah apane sainikon ke saath-saath aise patrakaron kii fuj bhi lekar chal rahaa tha jo uske paksh ke the yaa jinhen kareed liya gaya tha
 These journalists kept broadcasting information which was not true in the name of showing their news live
 aisi patrakarita ko hi jadit patrakarita yaa imbadid jarnalizam kaha jaataa he
 In such journalism, reporting is done as per the wishes of one party and the truth is lost
 kai baar is is patrakarita kaa upyog raajnneetik partiyon dwaara apane paksh main janamat banane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Some communicators believe that propaganda originated after the development of mass media
 ve ise sanchaar ke hisse ke rup main dekh kar maanate hai ki janamat ko apni taraf aakarshith karne ke liye kiya jane vaala sanchaar propaganda kaa ek prakaar he
 Here it is necessary to consider the relation of communication and propaganda
 ikkisvin sadi ke praarambhik daur main radio ke avishkaar ne propaganda ko ek vishesh oochaal diya
 Through the radio, your talk can be reached to a wider audience in a very short time
 radio ke vikaas ne swayan-prerit or pryojit soochna ko failaane kaa hi kaam nahin kiya, varan isane us vigyaapan kaa bhi sutarapaatr kiya jiske viksit rup aaj vibhinn roopon main hamaare saamne hai
 In such a short time before the development of radio, it was impossible to reach directly to a wider audience
 yah zarur he ki print madhyam dwaara bhi sidhe taur par soochna kaa sampreshan kiya ja saktaa tha, lekin samachar patron ke pathak kam hi the
 The condition of literacy was also associated with becoming a reader
 radio ne vigyaapan ke ek naveen sansar kaa anaavaran kiya jahaan padhane kii yogyata hona zaruri nahin tha
 This made the reach and influence of advertising unlimited
 vigyaapan ke saath-saath raajnneetik propaganda kaa bhi vistaar bahut teji se hua
 The arrival of TV to Propaganda after radio gave another new boom
 tivi ne radio ko apdasth to nahin kar paaya, lekin radio ke mukaable isaki vishwasaneeyata logon ko zyaada pramanik nazar aayi
 When big companies introduced their products exaggeratedly, people started seeing their image in that promotion
 isiilie vigyaapan guru alek padmasi ne ek baar kaha tha ki bharat ke log jab kisi vastu ke graahak banate hai to vah tark se kam or bhaavana se zyaada banate hai
 He cites the example of Liril soap and said, 'what do you think this girl who is wearing a bikini bathing in a waterfall and feels refreshed like the smell of lemon smell, is it really possible in the villages and cities of real India The Where a bucket of water would have been destined to be bathed in a manner, how could it feel like the smell of lemon? On this basis, Padmasi says that through propaganda, advertising creates an image in front of the consumer in which consumers start seeing their image
 haal hi ke varshon main internet or i-mail ke avishkaar ne propaganda ko vaishvik vistaar diya
 Web-mediums, for example, have the power to make a local issue a global issue
 bhugolinta kii sari simaaon kaa web-madhyamon ne ulanghan karke sampoorn duniya ko ek chote se gaanv main tabdeel kar diya he
 In a moment, people have taken advantage of the Internet system to go from local to global
 ek sthaneey gayak or local sangeet kaise kuch samay main hi internet ke madhyam se sabase lokapriy sangeet ban jaataa he iskaa sabase shashakt udhaaharan he kolaberi di naamak geet
 In the language of marketing, what we know as viral marketing is actually propaganda in the language of media
 ek taraf to propegande ko nakaaratmak baat sakaaratmak dhang se pesh karne vaala madhyam kii tarah dekha jaataa he or duusari taraf propaganda prachaar kaa ek aisa hunar bhi he jisamen kisi vishay-vastu ko kuch is tareeke se pesh kiya jaataa he ki uski taraf log aakarshith ho jaaen
 The related subject should be presented through a language, rhythm and music that the common consumer feels connected to and associates with the product
 iske liye media ke vibhinya madhyamon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Such as: television, radio, banner, internet, billboard, leaflet, etc
 bhaawanaaon ko sparsh dene kii is bhoomika main nakaaratmak paksh sirf itnaa hi he ki aisa propaganda manushya kii taarkikta kaa sanhaar karke uski jagah par bhaavnaatmak paksh ko zyaada prabhavi bana detaa he
 Tristian Tolliver, an American advertising writer, has said about Propaganda: i always think of myself that people don't like what you did and did for them
 balki aapako hameshaa isliye yaad kiya jaataa he ki aapane apni baton ke madhyam se unhen kya mahasoos karaayaa
 For example, in Propaganda, it does not matter much how well you put something, but the most important thing is that the feeling and inspiration that comes out of it leaves a mark on people
 propaganda ke sukhad ehsaas main lambe samay tak yaad rakhe jane kii kshamta hoti he
 In this context, the use of propaganda in advertising has started giving it a positive form rather than just being negative
 is pahalu ke mutabik propaganda rachanaatmak prakruti kii avadharana par aadhaarit ek sampoorn prakriya kaa naam he
 How it is to be used - depends entirely on the user

 Indian scholars consider this civilization to be of eternal tradition
 According to Western scholars, a community of Aryans arrived in India around 1500 BCE and this civilization started with their arrival
 aam taur par adhiktar vidwaan vaidic sabhyataa kaa kaal 1500 isvi isa purv se 500 isvi isa purv ke bich me maanate he, parantu nae puraatatva utkhanno se mili avasheshon me vaidic sabhyataa ke kai avshesh mili hai jisase aadhunik vidwaan jaise david frale, telgiri, bi bi laal, es r raav, subhash kaak, aravindo yah maanane lage he ki vaidic sabhyataa bharat me hi shuru hui thi or rugveda kaa rachana shunga kaal main huyi, Because there is no evidence from Archaeological excavations of Aryans coming to India nor any evidence from DNA Anusandhano, the foundation of the present Hinduism was laid in this period which still exists today
 vedon ke atirikt sanskrit ke anya kai grantho kii rachana bhi isi kaal main hui thi
 The Vedangasutraon is composed in arranging these Vedic texts of the mantra Brahmana and Upanishads
 Later Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranoki were composed, which are considered as the source of knowledge of this period
 anantar charvak, tantrikun ,buddha or jain dharm kaa udai bhi hua | Historians believe that the Aryans mainly lived in the plains of northern India, hence the center of Aryan civilization was mainly northern India
 is kaal main uttari bharat kai mahajanapadon main banta tha
 The Vedic civilization got its name because the Vedas are the major source of information of that period
 veda chaar he - rugveda, samaveda, atharvaveda or yajurveda
 Of these, the Rigveda was the first to be composed
 rugveda main hi gayatri mantra he jo savita ko samarpit he
 Scholars are not unanimous in determining the time of the Rigveda
 sabase pehle maiks mular ne vedon ke kaal nirdhaaran kaa prayaas kiya
 He arbitrarily gave 200–200 years of creation of three texts of Vedic literature, going backwards from Buddhism, and thus considered the Rigveda's creation period to be around 1200 BCE, but certainly no assessment of his assessment Was not the basis
 vaidic kaal ko mukhyatah do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- rigvaidic kaal or uttar vaidic kaal
 The Rig Vedic period was the period immediately after the arrival of the Aryans, in which rituals were secondary, but ritualism gained prominence in Hinduism in the later Vedic period
 is kaal kii tithi nirdhaaran jitani vivaadaaspad rahi he utani hi is kaal ke logon ke bare main sateek jaankaree
 a major reason for this is also that till this time only this book was composed
 maiks mular ke anusaar arya kaa mul nivas madhya aishia he
 The civilization built by the Aryans called the Vedic period
 aaryo dwaara viksit sabhyta gramin sabhyataa kahalaayi
 The language of the Aryans was Sanskrit
 maiks mular ne jab atakalbaaji karte hue ise 1200 isa purv se aarambh hota bataaya tha uske samakaleen vidwaan dablyoo

 hvitni ne isaki aalochana kii thi
 Max Müller then acknowledged that "there is no power on earth that can tell for sure that Vedic mantras were composed in 1000 BCE or 1500 BCE or 2000 or 3000"
 aisa mana jaataa he ki aaryon kaa ek samooh bharat ke atirikt iran or europe kii taraf bhi gaya tha
 The earliest texts in the Iranian language, Avesta, resemble the Rigveda
 agar is bhashik samarupata ko dekhen to rugveda kaa rachanakaal 1000 isapurv aata he
 But looking at the Hindu deities Inda, Mitravarun, Nasatya etc
 in the 1400 BCE inscription found in Bogaj-koi, it can be considered back and forth
 bal gangadhar tilak ne jyotishiya gananaa karke iskaa kaal 6000 i

 While Harmon Jacobi estimated it between 4500 BC and 2500 BC, the famous Sanskrit scholar Winternitz described it as 3000 BC

 In the Rig Vedic period only natural powers were worshiped and rituals were not prominent

 In the Rigvedic period, the residence of the Aryans was between the Indus and Saraswati rivers
 baad main ve sampoorn uttar bharat main fail chuke the
 The main area of civilization was the plain of the Ganges and its tributaries
 ganga ko aaj bharat kii sabase pavitra nadi mana jaataa he
 During this period the world expanded and many people became extinct
 bharat, tritsu or turvas jaise jan raajnneetik halkon se gaayab ho gaye jabaki puru pehle se adhik shaktishaalee ho gaye
 Some new states had developed in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, such as Kashi, Kosal, Videha, Magadha and Anga
 rigvaidic kaal main saraswati nadi ko sabase mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 The river Ganga and Yamuna are mentioned only once
 is kaal me kausambi nagar me pehali baar pakki ito kaa prayog kiya gaya
 In this period the varna started to be determined on the basis of birth instead of business
 samaveda kii rachana rugveda main die gaye mantron ko gane yogya banane hetu kii gayi thi
 Vedic mantras and samhitas are called Brahm
 The same Brahman's extended form has been called Brahmin
 puraatan brahman main aitarey, shatapath, panchvish, taitareey aadi vishesh mahatvapurn hai
 Maharishi Yajnavalkya has received the teachings of Brahmin texts including Aditya from Aditya
 samhitaon ke antargat karmkand kii jo vidhi updisht he brahman me usee kii sapramaan vyakhya dekhne ko miltaa he
 In the ancient tradition, there was a method of reciting the Vedas in a similar way
 atah brahmacharee richaon hi paath karte the ,grihasth brahmanon kaa, vanprastha aaranyakon or sanyasi upanishdon kaa
 The Brahmin is the honorable Vedabha of Garhasthadharma
 aaranyak vedon kaa vah bhaag he jo grihasthashram tyaag uparant vanprastha log jangal main paath kiya karte the | isi kaaran aaranyak namakaran kiya gaya
 The Upanishads are a collection of the oldest philosophical ideas
 upanishdon main ‘vrihadaaranyak’ tathaa ‘chandonya’, sarvaadhik prasiddh hai
 The state of India before Bimbisara can be known from these texts
 parakshit, unke putr janamejay tathaa pashchaat kaaleen raajaaon kaa ullekh inhen upanishdon main kiya gaya he
 It is clear from these Upanishads that the philosophy of Aryans was the best and more ahead of the philosophy of other civilized countries of the world
 aaryon ke aadhyatmik vikaas, pracheenatam dharmikavastha or chintan ke jite-jaagate jivant udhaaharan inhen upanishdon main milte hai
 The Upanishads were probably composed during the Buddha era, as the first attempt to establish the importance of spiritual advancement on material desires resulted from the reaction of the development of Buddhist and Jain religions
 ugantar main vaidic adhyayan ke liye chah vidhaon kaa janm hua jinhen ‘vedang’ kehete hai
 Vedang literally means part of the Vedas, however due to this literature being sacred, it is counted separately from Shruti literature
 vedang ko smriti bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki yah manushyon kii kriti maani jaati he
 Vedang is in the form of sutra, it attempts to contain more facts in less words
 vedang kii sankhya 6 he Sutra literature is a part of Vedic literature

 Franklin then envisaged a membership library, which would collect funds from members for the purchase of books for everyone to read

 Upon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former business
 By 1730, Franklin had established a printing house of his own and took measures to become the publisher of The Pennsylvania Gazette, a newspaper
 Gazette gave Franklin a platform of agitation for various local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and commentaries
 Over time, his commentary and masterful presentation of a positive image of him as a hardworking and intellectual young man received considerable social respect

 In 1730, at the age of 24, Franklin publicly acknowledged having an illegitimate son named William, who would later become the last Loyalist governor of New Jersey
 Although William's mother's identity remained unknown, perhaps the responsibility of an infant child provided a reason for Franklin to take up residence with Deborah

 As deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation method
 In 1768, Franklin went to England as Postmaster General, and there he heard a curious complaint by the colonial board of the border: the time it took for an average merchant ship to reach Newport, Rhode Island, than a British mail ship from England to New York
 Why it takes a couple of weeks, despite the fact that the merchant ships would leave London after the Thames would be through the English Channel Afterwards cross the Atlantic, while the packets reach the Sea directly from Falmouth in Cornwall? Confused, Franklin invited his cousin Timothy Folger, a Nantucket whaler captain and at the time in London, to dinner
 folgar ne unase kaha ki vyapaaree jahaaj, niyamit rup se gulf stream se parhez karte hai, jabaki mail packet ke captain sidhe usamen ghus jate hai, tab bhi jab america whaler unhen bataate hai ki ve ek teen mile prati ghante kii dhara main ja rahe hai

 Later editions were printed in 1778 in France and in 1786 in America
 The British version of the chart, which was the original, was ignored so that everyone believed it was lost forever, but then Phil Richardson, a Woods Hole oceanographer and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris 
 It was featured on the cover page in the New York Times

 This beneficial trading system provided free time to study and in a few years he made discoveries that gave him a reputation among the educated throughout Europe and especially in France

 Franklin proposed that "vitreous" and "resinous" electricity are not two different types of electrical fluid, but the same electric fluid at different pressures

 In his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the danger and introduced alternative methods to demonstrate the electric current of flaring, as demonstrated in his use of the concept of electric ground
 If Franklin had really done the experiment, he would not have done it in the way it is often told, flying a kite and waiting for an electric shock, because it could be dangerous

 He noted that instead of a smooth point the sharpened driver was able to discharge silently and from a relatively high distance
 He had the idea that this knowledge could be used to protect buildings from lightning, under which "a straight rod of iron, which has been gilted like a needle and gilt to prevent rust, and those rods a wire from the lower end goes into the ground outside the building; 


 should these pointed sticks pull the electrical fire coming out of a cloud silently before coming close to the building, and so we get that most Protect it from sudden and terrible damage

 The text itself has been translated as Padmapurana
