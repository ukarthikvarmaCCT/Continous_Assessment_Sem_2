 The Röntgen equivalent human is its classical measuring unit
 germany main vurtsburg vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke praadhyaapak wilhelm conrad rantjan ne 1895 main eksre kaa avishkaar kiya
 If the air from the glass tube is pumped out and electrified in a high voltage respectively, then the air starts to self-illuminate when the pressure is low enough
 is ghatana kaa praayogic adhyayan karte samay rantjan ne yah dekha ki vaayu kaa daab atyant alp hone par kaach kii nalika main se jo kirane aati hai, unase barium platinosynide ke manibh prakaash dene lagate hai or, nalika ko kaale kaagaj se purna rup se dhakne par bhi, paas main rakhe manibh dhyutimaan hote rahete hai
 Therefore, it was clear that the rays coming out of the esophagus could easily pass through the black paper and these rays have the special property of damaging the screen of barium platenocyanide
 vigyaan main is prakaar kii kirane tab tak gyaat nahin thim
 So these newly invented rays were named 'x-rays', but in honor of Rantzen, especially in Germany, these rays are called 'rantzen rays'
 rantjan ke avishkaar ke prakashit hote hi sampurna vaigyanik vishwa kaa dhyaan eksre kii ore aakrisht hua
 The x-ray property of crossing through opaque solids was extremely important and this property could be used in many departments of science
 at: anek bhautikee prayogshaalaon main eksre ke utpaadan tathaa unke gundharmo ke adhyayan ke praytn hone lage
 The study of electric immersion in air at low pressure has a special place in the development of modern physics
 yadi kaanch kii ek lambii nalika ko nirvaat pump se jodakar bheetar kii vaayu main ucch vibhav kii vidyudwara pravaahit kii jaae to prarambh main, jab daab adhik rahati he tab, koi kriya dikhaai nahin detii, kintu vaayu kii daab jab alp ho jaati he tab pehle donon vidyudagr dhyutimaan hote hai
 Lowering the pressure further reduces the entire tube
 aadhunik bhautikee kii vyakhya ke anusaar iskaa kaaran he ki jab electranon ko urja praapt hoti he or ve dhanagar kii ore ati veg se jate samay shesh vaayu ke anuon se sanghaat karte hai
 The ions of molecules are formed due to the collisions and when these ions get to the previous state then light is emitted
 yanon ke astitv ke kaaran vaayu main vidyudvisarjan jari rahata he
 When the pressure is too low, there are not enough molecules to collide with the electrons; Therefore, the electrons come out of the minuscule and collide directly with the material with all their energy
 in sanghaton ke kaaran electranon kii teevr urja dhanagar ke parmaanuon ko mil jaati he or iskaa ek parinaam eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 This method requires a critical pressure in the tube to produce an x-ray
 vaayu kii daab yadi is kranthik daab se adhik ho to eksre ke utpaadan ke liye paryaapt urja electranon main nahin rahati 
 On the other hand, if the pressure is less than this critical pressure, electrons are not generated, so the electric discharge stops
 prarambh main eksre kaa utpaadan isi prakaar kii vayunalee kaa upyog karke kiya jaataa tha or vaayu kii daab ko mahatprayas se is kranthik daab ke maan par rakhaa jaataa tha
 Two special properties of X-rays are more important: tivrathamapan kii teen mukhya vidhiyaan hai
 The intensity of the fluorescence from the X-ray on the fluorescent screen — to the extent of the illumination — is proportional to the intensity of the X-ray
 pratidipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan karke eksre kii tivrata kii tulana sthool rup se ho sakati he
 In the second method, the action of X-ray above the photo palette is used
 eksre ke aapatan se photo pattica par jo kaalaapan aata he, vah eksre kii tivrata tathaa aapatan kaal par nirbhar rahata he
 This method allows the action of an X-ray of greater intensity to take place at the appropriate place on a photo plate with a higher intensity of the X-ray beam, and then the action of the second X-ray beam on the same plaque down t, 2t
 , 3t etc
 pattica ko viksit karne ke pashchaat donon chitron ke kaalepan kii tulana karne se donon punjon kii saapeksh tivrata kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 The third method of intensity measurement is more prevalent, because intensity can be measured precisely in this manner
 jab eksre vaayu main se jaati he tab vaayu vidyucchalak ho jaati he or uski chaalakata eksre kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The electrons of air molecules are displaced by the action of X-rays and ions are produced
 uchit vidyudvibhav kii upasthiti main yanon se jo vidyuddhara praapt hoti he, vah samvedi vidyunmapi se, athwa anya uchit samvedi upkarnon se, maapi ja sakati he
 The intensity of the x-ray is proportional to the electrode
 haal main gunak-prakashanalika or eksre-samvedi sphur ke upyog se tivrata kaa maapan atyant sulabh ho gaya he
 Similarly, the stream of ionization can also be easily measured with the help of a gelatinizer
 at: vartmaankaal main in donon prakaar ke upkarnon dwaara eksre kii tivrata kaa maapan adhik prachlit he
 These three popular methods of intensity measurement can only compare the intensities of the two x-ray elements, the absolute intensity cannot be achieved
 apati eksre ke lambavat ek varg centimetre kshetrafal par prati senkad jo urja padati he, usko vastut: ham us eksre kii tivrata kah sakate hai
 This intensity is expressed in ergs per square centimeter per second
 tivrata kaa maapan urja ke rup main karne ke liye eksre kii urja ko ushma atyant alp hone ke kaaran is reeti se tivrathamapan ke liye atyant sookshmagrahi vishisht upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this manner, Terrill made the first attempt to intensify
 iske pashchaat 1953 i
 main america main ilinay vishvavidhyalay ke henderson, beati evam laafan ne bhi praytn kiye
 The intensity of the x-ray generated by very high current can only be measured in this way
 bhautikee ke praayogic kaaryo main sadaa ekakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or maapi gai raashi ke anusaar iskaa swaroop hota he
 The unit of X-ray quantity is called 'rantzen' and in the present tense the definition of a Rantzen is as follows- eksre kaa doosraa vishesh gundharm unki thos padaartho main praveshkshmata he
 The decrease in the intensity of the X-ray is not the same when the different solids are passed through the same mass
 kuch thos padaartho main eksre kaa avasorana adhik hota he ore kuch padaartho main kam
 The result of this experiment is that if the x-ray crosses the different mots of a particular solid, then the output x-ray is related to the intensity, initial intensity and thickness of the solid according to the following equation: log = – m × motaai --- Here = initial intensity of x-ray; i = thos padaarth main se paar hone ke pashchaat eksre kii tivrata; m = a constant, called the absorption multiplier
 is sthiraank ko us thos vishesh eksre-avasorana-gunak kehete hai
 In fact it is a linear multiplier
 isko vyapak rup main vyakt karne ke liye main us thos padaarth ke ghanatv kaa bhaag diya jaataa he or is prakaar praapt avasorana gunank ko 'sanhati-avasorana-gunank' kehete hai
 Therefore mmass = m / ghanatv The special significance of the Samhita-absorption-multiplier is that it is the characteristic property of the absorbing material
 udaahranarth, jal or bhaap kaa rekhiy avasorana-gunak bhinn hota he, kyonki jal drav he or bhaap gas hai
 But the x-ray code-absorption-coefficient of water and steam is the same, because the chemical preservatives of water and steam are integral, namely, hydrogen and oxygen
 prakaash or eksre ke gundharmo kii bhinnata sanhati-avasorana-gunak se atyant spasht ho jaati he
 Generally, liquids and solids are themselves opaque or translucent to light
 prakaash ke liye hira paardarshee or graphite apaardarshee he, parantu eksre kaa sanhati-avasorana-gunank hira tathaa graphite ke liye samaan hi rahata he, kyonki ye donon padaarth vastut: carbon ke hi vibhinn swaroop hai
 Absorption coefficients of the entire X-rays from the X-ray tube are mainly dependent on both the electrical current and the atomic number of the metal of the absorber screen
 jaise jaise vibhav badhata jaataa he vaise hi vaise utpaadit eksre kii praveshkshmata athwa kathorta badhati jaati he
 The equation leads to the conclusion that the absorption multiplier for a single solid will be constant for all the masses
 kintu pratyaksh prayog main eksre nalika se praapt vikiran kaa nune praveshkshamtawala bhaag avasorak parade ke pratham staron main hi purnataya avashoshit ho jaataa he 
 Only X-rays of high penetrability reach the final levels of the absorption screen
 spasht he ki avasorana parade main pravesh karanevaale eksre kaa avasorana gunank parade se paar nikle hue eksre ke avasorana gunak se adhik hota he
 When the absorption multiplier of all x-rays is the same, then they are called homogeneous x-rays
 at: eksre kii maatra unki tivrata se or unki visheshta unke avasorana-gunak se maapit hota he
 We can see the matter from which light comes, because light rays have an action on the design of our eye
 is prakaar kii kriya eksre dwaara nahin hoti, at: eksre drishy nahin hai
 Not only this, the action of each other on the eyes and other parts of the body is very harmful
 jivit koshaaon par eksre kii paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se ve mritt ho jaati hai
 X-rays easily cross through the skin and they are likely to die due to their long-term action on the living cells within
 phir, eksre ke prabhaav tikaoo hote he; at: sharir ke ek hi sthaan par bhinn-bhinn samayon par bhi eksre kii kriya hoti rahane par kuch kaal main cancer sadrush du:saadhy rog ho jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to work very carefully while using X-ray
 sharir kii raksha ke liye vishesh saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 In addition, current x-ray users keep an x-ray-measure in their pocket in the present tense, which shows how much radiation has worked on the employee
 eksre ke is ghaatak gundharm kaa anya rogon main upyog bhi kiya jaataa he; jaise, sharir ke kisi bhaag main anisht roganuon kii vruddhi hoti ho to unpar eksre kaa prayog karke unhen nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays are used more in medicine, especially in surgery
 is prakaar ke upyog kii sambhaavna eksre ke avishkaar ke samay se hi spasht thi
 Different elements of the body have different absorption-multipliers; Therefore, by taking an x-ray from any part of the body and taking a photo, the bones and other components are seen separately
 at: shalya kriya ke purv, athwa yah gyaat karne ke liye ki rog kis avasthaa main he eksre photo atyant upyogi hote hai
 As the production of X-rays progressed, they started to be used in industries as well, and in the present times the use of X-rays in metallurgy has become necessary
 urja yaa to kanon ke saath athwa tarangon ke saath sanyukt rahati he
 If energy is emitted from an origin, the existence of this energy is usually expressed in the intensity of electromagnetic waves, or as the kinetic energy of particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, ions etc
 tarang or kan ke swaroop bhinn hote hai; isliye inako saadhaarant: bhinn virgo main rakhaa jaataa he
 But it has become clear from the results of many experiments that the bonding of these classes has properties of particles in waves and, conversely, particles also have properties of waves
 is dwait rup kaa prarambh plank ke ushmavikiran ke siddhant se prarambh hua
 The properties of X-rays are also no exception to this dual form
 eksre ke katipay gun tarangon ke hai tathaa katipay gun kanon ke bhi hai
 First we will consider the wavelet properties

 The action occurring on the photo plate and the properties of ionization done in the gas are also similar
 1905 i

 X-rays are unaffected in electrical and magnetic fields
 in sab gunon se yah spasht tha ki eksre aaweshit kan nahin, prakaash ke samaan vidyucchumbakeey prakruti ke hai
 The distinction can only be in wavelengths
 haaga, windt, walter, pole, somarfeld ityadi vaigyanikon ke prayogon se yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa tha ki eksre kaa tarangadairghy 1×10-8 se

 But the first conclusive results came from experiments with Lave, Friederisch and Kniping, and the wavelength of X-rays was proved
 is prayog ke pashchaat eksre kii tarangaprakruti suspasht karne ke tathaa uske sambandh main anya parinaamon ke praayogic fal praapt karne ke tathaa uske sambandh main anya parimaanon ke praayogic fal praapt karne ke anek praytn hue
 As the x-ray wavelength is much less than the wavelength of light, there are many difficulties in using experiments for x-rays, by which the wavelength of light can be easily measured
 kintu vartmaan kaal main prakashako ke prayogon ke samaan eksre kaa vyatikaran, vivartan, dhruvan ityadi gun suspasht karne ke prayog safal hue hai or eksre ke tarangadairghy utani hi yarthathata se gyaat hue hai jitani se prakaashiya tarangon ke gyaat hue the
 Some of the experiments by which the x-ray waveform is proved are given below- eksre se manibh sanrachana jaanane main vishesh sahaayta milti he 
 Apart from medical uses, X-rays are also used in many ways
 eksre ke vishisht gunon ke kaaran unka upyog vistrut rup se vigyaan kii anek shakhaon tathaa vibhinn udyogon main hota aa rahaa he
 X-rays are used a lot in industries, especially in the construction and control of the properties of manufactured materials
 nirmit padaartho kii antasya trutiyaan eksre photographon dwaara saralata se gyaat kii ja sakati hai
 Aircraft and instruments of the same type of equipment have to withstand extremely high velocity and extreme physical conditions; In the manufacture of such instruments, every element must be innocent and accurate
 aise prayek avyav kii pariksha eksre se kii jaati he or sadosh avyavon kaa tyaag kiya jaataa he
 Metals absorb x-rays, so soft x-rays are unsuitable for examination of the metals' interfaces
 vishaal aakaar ke dhatviya padaartho ke liye atyucch vibhav ke eksre kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 X-rays are very useful in metallurgy and metallurgy
 dhaatu bhi manibhiya hote hai, kintu inke manibh sookshm hote hai or ve yathechh prakaar se sthapit rahete hai, at: dhaatuon kii lave-pratimaa main saamanyat: sankendre vartual rahete hai
 Each circle is of equal intensity, but due to the increase in the size of particles due to some physical activity, the points in these circles also come
 at: eksre vyabhang dwaara iskaa thik thik pataa chal jaataa he ki dhatviya manibhon ke kan kis prakaar ke hai or unka aakaar aadi kaisaa he
 This knowledge has great importance in metallurgy

 Folding of a metal also causes it to become insoluble
 aisi vikrutiyon kaa vishleshan eksre se ho saktaa he
 Thus X-rays are of particular use in obtaining flawless metals with specific properties
 eksre ke anya upyogon main eksre sookshmdarshi ullekhneey he
 The wavelengths of X-rays are smaller than the wavelengths of light, so X-ray microscopes should be more effective than light microscopes
 1948 main eksre ko kendrit karne ke karkapetric ke praytn anshat: safal hue
 Efforts to magnify the image in this manner and other ways have now crossed the experimental stage and many types of X-ray microscopes manufactured by many manufacturers are accessible

 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card

 Anuj Saxena is an Indian actor who started his film career in 2001 with the serial "kusum"
 upachaaraarthi kendrit manashchikitsa yaa vyakti-kendrit chikitsa yaa anirdeshaatmak chikitsa maansik upachaar kii ek vidhi he jisamen rogi ko lagaataar sakriy rakhaa jaataa he or bina koi nirdesh die use nirog banane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 In contrast, it is self-preservation in which neither the patient is made dependent on the doctor nor the circumstances before him are interpreted, on the contrary, by indirectly helping the patient to try to mature his cognitive and emotional area so that He could adjust himself to the present and future circumstances
 isamen chikitsak kaa daayitv maatr itnaa hota he ki vah rogi ke liye "swasangrakshan"kii vyavastha kaa uchit prabandh karata rahe kyonki rogi ke samvegatmak kshetra main samaayojan laane ke liye chikitsak kaa sahyog vaanchit hi nahin, aavashyak bhi he
 Nonoperative therapy is very similar to psychoanalysis
 donon main hi chetan-avchetan-str par prastut bhaavana ichchhaaon kii abhivyakti ke liye puri aazaadee rahati he
 The only difference is that in indirect treatment, the patient is kept familiar with the problems of the present, while in psychoanalysis, he is taken towards the memories of the past
 maansik upachaar kii yah vidhi safal rahi he kyonki jaise hi rogi main ek vishisht sujh paidaa hoti he, vah swasth ho jaataa he
 Instructional therapy also has certain drawbacks: kuch vyaktiyon or rogon par iskaa prabhaav nahin hota
 This method is successful only at the higher intellectual level
 vartmaan paristhitiyon se sambhddha samasyaayen hi isse sulajh sakati hai, ateet main viksit manogranthiyon par iskaa prabhaav nahin hota
 Treatment-focused psychiatry is a psychological method of mental illness prevention propounded by Carl Rogers
 rogers kaa swa-vaad prasiddh he jo adhikanshat: upachaar prakriya yaa paristhitiyon se udbhoot pradatton par avlambit he
 Rogers' original fantasies are about self-development, self-knowledge, self-control, familiarity with external and internal experiences, development of understanding, real acceptance of emotions, etc
 vastut: vyakti main vriddhivikas, abhiyojan evam swasthyalabh tathaa swasphoton kii swaabhaavik vritti hoti he
 Mental conflict and emotional excitement inhibit this type of feeling
 in avarodhon kaa nivaaran bhaavon ke prakaashan or unako angikaar karne se sujh ke udai hone se ho jaataa he
 In this method, such an environment is present that the patient remains more and more active
 vah swatantra hokar upachaarak ke sammukh apane bhaavon, ichchhaaon tathaa tanaav sambandhi anubhutiyon kaa abhivyaktikaran kare, uddeshy, prayojan ko samajhe or sangrakshan ke liye duusare par ashrith na rah jaae
 In this, self-preservation or self-sighting is necessary
 upachaarak paroksh rup se, bina hastkshep ke rogi ko vastusthiti kii chetana main keval sahaayta detaa he jisase uske bhavatmak, gyanatmak kshetra main praudhata aae
 He does not instruct, nor does he explain the situation
 is vidhi ke paanch str hai : Assistance of the treatment-seeker: This is the role of active support of the patient
 upachaarak apane haav bhav, rang dhang or baatcheet se prarambh main hi yah spasht kar detaa he ki uske paas rogi kii samasyaon kaa pratyuttar nahin he
 Yes, upon coming in contact, the patient must feel a situation in which he can solve his problems
 bhaavon kii abhivyakti : sahanubhuti kaa vaataavaran paane se rogi ke nishedhaatmak evam virdohi sanvegon kaa, jo abhi tak nichle str par dabe the, pradarshan ho jaataa he
 Similarly, there is also a free release of positive sentiments
 bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti upachaar kaa ek aavashyak ang he
 Without this, prevention of disease is not possible
 antardrushti kaa abhyuday : ek nai drushti se udai hone se rogi apane vaastavik swa ko usee rup main angikaar karata he tathaa vaastavik swa or adarsh swa main saamanjasy laata he
 Positive Attempts: In this state he makes macro plans and is proactive
 sampark kaa samaapan : is avasthaa main rogi ko kisi prakaar kii sahaayta lene kii aavashyaktaa nahin rah jaati
 He becomes a free thinker and a pioneer
 aatmavishvaas ke udai hone se uski vichaardhaara main parivartan aa jaataa he or vah daayitv kaa anubhav karata he
 He does not need the help of the therapist and 'that is enough' - this feeling rises and becomes firm in him
 yadhyapi upachaaraarthi kendrit manashchikitsa upachaar kii utkrisht vidhi he tathaapi kuch aise maansik rog hai jinpar iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Mostly, this treatment method proves to be highly beneficial when there is mental and general mental debility
 is yukti ke dwaara taatkaalik samasya sahaj hi sulajh jaati he
 This method is mostly successful on those whose intellectual level is high

 england main chosar or uske samasamyik kavi gower ne us adarsh ko samaan safalataa ke saath angreji kavita main pratishthit kiya
 In English, Chaucer is often called the 'french poet' because of the sublime sentiment of French poetry and the cleanliness, elegance and plausibility of its expression
 isamen andeh nahin ki chosar ne prasiddh premgautha di romance ow di rose or apane purvavarti yaa samakaleen french kaviyon, masho, dashan, fwasar or granjon se bahut kuch siikhaa
 This influence can be seen in the preface to his early works and The Legend of Good Women, The Book of Duchess, The Parliament of Fouls, The House of Fame
 inamen pratik yojana yaa roopak, swapn, adarsh prem, madhu praat, coloravamagn pakshi ityadi french kavita kii anek visheshtaon kaa samavesh he
 He also has a wide influence on Chaucer's verses
 1372 i
 main chosar kii pratham italy yatra ke baad uski kavita main ek or nayaa tatv aata he
 Dante, Petrarch and Boccachio not only gave him new subjects but also gave him new vision
 inamen se antim kavi ne use sabase adhik prabhavit kiya
 In addition to taking many stories from Boccacho, Chaucer learned the art of narration, engaging picture planning and impulsive expression
 uski prasiddh rachana fa trialas and cresidf par yah nayaa prabhaav spasht he
 But Chaucer's genius was not merely going to survive on debts; He enlivened many ancient legends with realistic and dramatic characterization, humor and satire and spirited narration
 chosar kii antim or mahaan kriti di cantarbari tels main uski pratibha apni sari shakti ke saath prakat hui
 This composition is a picture of his society and because of its realism, it has left the poetry of France and Italy far behind
 is rachana main chosar ne apana sara gyaan or maanav jivan kaa adhyayan undel diya
 In this, Chaucer also influenced the future development of the play and novel through realistic characterization and the mutual struggle of the characters
 udaar vyangy or vidrup kii parampara bhi isi kriti se prarambh hui
 Chaucer had the amazing ability to use rods
 fa trialas and cresidf main prayukt saat panktiyon kaa fa rime roilf or fa di cantarbari telsf main prayukt dashavarni tukant dwipadi kaa vyapak prayog aage kii angreji kavita main hua
 Gower's position is also high among Chaucer's contemporaries
 uski rachana kanfesio amantis kii prem kahaniyon par naitikta kaa gaharaa put he
 Therefore, he was also called the Faustic Gowerf
 usamen chosar kii yathartwadita or vinodpriyata nahin he
 He is a poet of clean craft more than talent
 wiliam langland 14veen shatabdi kii atyant prasiddh rachana fa piers plaumanaf kaa kavi he
 He behaved in a surprising style of English
 lekin uski kavita us yug ke saamaajik or dharmik paakhandon ke virudadh chunauti he
 It establishes the importance of religion and its mystique for life
 puri rachana roopak he or uske arth ke kai str hai
 But Langland has successfully captured the narrative pieces
 langland main chosar or gower kaa maadhurya nahin, vah aakrosh or oj kaa kavi he
 In this era, there were other more well-known compositions in which Sir Gwyn and the Green Knight and Pearl are particularly notable
 ye kramash athar kii gaatha or di romance ov di rose par aadhaarit he
 The first expresses a subtle vision of characterization and an affection for extraordinary forms and situations of nature, and the second is full of depressive gentle feelings and mysticism
 chosar kii mratyu or punarjagran ke bich kaa samay arthath puri 15veen shatabdi kavita kii drushti se anurvar he
 Many of Chaucer's and some of Langland's followers were in England and Scotland
 lekin unamem se adhikansh kii kavita nirjeev he
 Scotland's followers were far more powerful than English followers such as Acklive, Lydgate, Hodge, Barclay and Skelton as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar and James I, because they cared more for the truth of their dialect, the natural beauty and sensations of their land
 is shatabdi kii mahatvapurn rachanaaon main dharm, prem tathaa parakram sambandhi geeton or baildon kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 Satire and witty poems were also written

 This humanism was the ideology of the new class of merchant capitalists against the religion, society, morality and philosophy of the feudal system
 isi varg kii prerana se dharm-sudhaar-andolan hua, jyotish or vigyaan main krantikari anusandhan hue, dhan or nae deshon kii khoj main saahasik saamudrik yatraayen huin
 Humanism proclaimed the immense possibilities of knowledge and karma of the individual, as well as the liberation of experiments and imagination in literature
