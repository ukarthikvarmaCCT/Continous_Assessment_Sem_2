 In this way the line moves northward like the icebergs of NJ9842
 is kshetra main ghaas kaa ek tinkaa tak nahin ugta he, saans lenaa tak sard mausam ke kaaran behad kathin he
 However, this destination is one where India, Pakistan and China share borders, so it has special importance in terms of security
 hameshaa kii tarah atikaraman or uksaane vaali kaarywahi pakistan dwaara hi yahan bhi kii gai
 At first, at the time of setting the border, it shifted the area of 5180 square kilometers which belonged to India to the border of China

 There the Pakistan troops erected their outpost and named it 'qaid Outpost'
 yah naam pakistan ke janak kaayade-ajam mohammad ali jinna ke naam par rakhaa gaya tha
 It is also very interesting to understand the structure of that post
 vah chaowkee, glacier ke upar ek durg kii tarah banaai gai, jiske donon tarah 1500 feet unchi barf kii deevaaren thim
 It was built by Pakistan like its outpost 'qaid' within the Indian border, which cannot be named other than encroachment
 jaahir he, bharat ke liye is ghatana kii jaankaree paakar chup baithna sambhav nahin tha
 The Indian Army made a proposal that we should remove this post from there and take possession of it

 Well, taking advantage of the darkness, Bana Singh and his team were moving forward
 raste main unhen un bhartiya bahaduron ke shav bhi padi dikh rahe the jinhone yahaan pahunchne ke raste main praan ganvaae the
 Anyway, Bana Singh managed to reach the top with his companions
 vahaan pahunch kar usne apane dal ko do hissen main baantkar do dishaao main tainaat kiya or phir us 'kaayad post' par grenade phenkane shuru kiya
 Grenades showed their work in the bunkers built there
 saath hi duusare dal ke javaanon ne dushman ke sainikon ko, joki us chaowkee par the, banet se maut ke ghat utaarna shuru kar diya
 Pakistan's Special Service Group commandos were stationed there, who died in this sudden attack and escaped leaving some posts
 kuch hi der main vah chaowkee dushmano ke haath se bhartiya bahaduron ke haath main aa gai
 The front was destroyed
 bana singh samet unka dal sahi salaamat us par kabiz ho gaya

 The wheeled rover will run on the surface of the moon and collect soil or rock samples for analysis
 aankadon ko chandrayan-2 orbitor ke madhyam se prithvi par bheja jaayegaa
 The team that successfully carried out the Chandrayaan-1 campaign under the leadership of Mylaswamy Annadurai is also working on Chandrayaan-2
 12 navambar 2007 ko isro or roosi antariksh agency ke pratinidhiyon ne chandrayan-2 pariyojna par saath kaam karne ke ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 The main responsibility of the orbiter and the rover will be that of ISRO and the Roskosmos will be responsible for the lander

 The design of the spacecraft was completed in August 2009, in which scientists of both countries made their joint contribution
 haalanki isro ne chandrayan -2 kaarykram ke anusaar pelod ko antim rup diya
 But the campaign was postponed in January 2013
 tathaa abhiyaan ko 2016 ke liye punarnirdhaarit kiya
 Because Russia was unable to develop the lander in time
 roskosmos ko baad main mangal grah ke liye bheje phobose-grant abhiyaan me mili vifaltaa ke kaaran chandrayan -2 kaarykram se alag kar diya gaya
 And India decided to develop the lunar mission independently

 Unlike the Moon Impact Probe of Chandrayaan-1, which hits the lunar surface, the lander will descend slowly
 lander kisi bhi vaigyanik gatividhiyon pradarshan nahin karenge
 The lander and rover will weigh about 1250 kg
 prarambh main, lander rus dwaara bharat ke saath sahyog se viksit kiye jane kii ummid thi
 When Russia expressed its inability to develop the lander before 2015
 to bhartiya adhikariyon ne swatantra rup se lander ko viksit karne kaa nirnay liya
 Russia meant to cancel the lander
 ki mishan profil parivartit ho jaaegi
 The study of the initial configuration of the indigenous lander was completed in 2013 by the Space Applications Center, Ahmedabad
 chandramaa kii sataha par landing ke liye anusandhan dal ne landing vidhi kii pahchaan kii
 And studied the technologies associated with it
 in praudyogikiyon main ucch sankalp camera, nevigation camera, khatra parihaar camera, ek mukhya taral ingine or ultimetre, veg meter, excyllarometer or in ghatakon ko chalaane ke liye software aadi he
 The main engine of the lander has been successfully tested for a period of 513 seconds
 sensor or software ke band loop satyaapan pareekshan 2016 ke madhya main pareekshan karne kii yojana banaai he
 The engineering model of the lander underwent groundwater and aerial tests in late October 2016 at Chunlare in Chitradurga district, Karnataka
 isro ne landing site kaa chayan karne ke liye or lander ke sensor kii kshamta kaa akalan karne main sahaayta ke liye chunalere main kareeb 10 cretar banaae
 The rover will weigh between 20-30 kg and will be powered by solar energy
 The rover will move on the surface of the moon with wheels, collect samples of soil and rocks, analyze them chemically and send the data up to the orbiter from where it will be sent to the station of the Earth
 praarambhik yojana main rover ko rus main dizin or bharat main nirmit kiya janaa tha
 However, Russia refused to design the rover in May 2010
 iske baad, isro ne rover ke dizin or nirmaan khud karne kaa faisla kiya
 IIT Kanpur developed three subsystems of Rover to provide mobility: isro ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ek visheshgy samiti ke nirnay ke anusaar orbitor par paanch tathaa rover par do pelod bheje jaayenge
 haalanki shuruyaat main bataaya gaya tha ki nasa tathaa iese bhi is abhiyaan main bhaag lenge or orbitor ke liye kuch vaigyanik upkarnon ko pradaan karenge, isro ne baad main spasht kiya ki vajan pratibandhon ke chalate vah is abhiyaan par kisi bhi gaiyr-bhartiya pelod ko saath nahin le jaayegi

 Aesthetics is the study of sensory-emotional qualities — religion and values
 kala, samskruti or prakruti kaa pratankan hi saundaryashastra he
 Aesthetics is a part of philosophy
 ise soundaryamimasaa tatha anandamimasaa bhi kehete hai
 Beauty is the scripture in which there is an elemental, philosophical and poignant interpretation of the beauty that is expressed or contained in artistic works, creations etc
 kisi sundar vastu ko dekhakar hamaare man main jo anandadaayini anubhuti hoti he uske swabhaav or swaroop kaa vivechan tathaa jivan kii anyaanya anubhutiyon ke saath uskaa samanvay sthapit karnaa inkaa mukhya uddeshy hota he
 Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy under which questions related to art, literature and beauty are discussed
 gyaan ke daayre se bhinn indriya-bodh dwaara praapt hone vaale taatparyon ke liye unani bhashaa main 'astetiko' shabd he jisase 'esthetics' kii vyutpatti hui
 a classical aesthetical approach related to nature, art, and literature developed
 yah nazariyaa keval kriti kii sundarata or kala-rup se hi apana sarokaar rakhte hue uske raajnneetik or sandarbhagat ayaamon ko vimarsh ke daayre se baahar rakhata he
 But there are also some methods of brainstorming art and literature that communicate the meaning of works and social and historical aspects of their creation process
 marxvaadi saundaryashastra ek aisa hi vimarsh he
 Plato's work in ancient Greek philosophy discusses the concept of beauty in Hippias Major
 naatak kii dukhaant style par arestu dwaara apni rachana poitics main kiye gayi vichaar ne kala-aalochana ko lambe arase tak prabhavit kiya he
 In the context of non-western ancient thinking on art and beauty, the Natyashastra of India, Abhinavagupta's rasa-siddhanta and the creation of Chinese scholar Cheng Yin-yuwan, Li-tai ming-hua Chi's unique and elaborate discussions presented in the Western world as well is believed
 kala-anushilan kii is parampara kii vyakhya karne ke gair-pashchimi maanak abhi tak nahin ban paye hai or pashchimi maanakon ke zariye kii gayi vyakhyaaon ke nattejey asantoshjanak nikle hai
 a separate concept of aesthetics emerged as a philosophical activity in Western thought in the eighteenth century when art works began to be isolated from handcrafts
 iskaa nateeja siddhantkaron dwaara lalit kala kii avadharana ke sutrikaran main niklaa
 Alexander Gottlieb Bomgarthen wrote an esthetica in 1750 to initiate a debate
 iske saat saal baad david hum dwaara ‘of da standard of test’ likh kar saundaryashastra ke ubharate hue vimarsh ko prashnaankit kiya gaya
 But the real beginning of modern European aesthetic aesthetics began with Emmanuel Kant's work published in 1790, Critique of Judgment
 apni is kriti main kaant ne saundaryashastreey akalan kii kasautiyon ko saarvbhaum banane par jor diya
 But on the other hand, he appeared to be skeptical of the possibility of any kind of universal aesthetics
 is virodhabhas ke baavjood kaant kii uplabdhi yah rahi ki unhone kala or saundarya kii vivechna ke liye kuch anivaary dvibhajanon ko sthapit kar diya
 The most notable of these dialects are: sense perception and logic, essence and form, expression and expression, pleasure and epiphany, freedom and necessity, etc
 kaant kii duusari uplabdhi yah thi ki unhone saundaryashastreey anubhav or andrik anubhav ke bich antar sthapit kiya
 He said that aesthetics should be interpreted and concluded without any practical attachment to the goal of analysis
 unnisvin sadi ke bare main kaha ja saktaa he ki vah saundaryashastra kii shatabdi thi
 It was only on Kant's land that German scholars later created a larger philosophical framework of aesthetics
 higel ne apni rachana lectures on esthetics main, shoppenhor ne da world ez vil and ripragentation main or nitshe ne berth of tragedy main pashchimi saundaryashastra ke vibhinn pahaluon kii baarik vyakhyaayein kin or uske naye ayaamon ko prakashit kiya
 Formalism emerged in English-speaking aesthetics in the late nineteenth century
 victoriayan britain ne ‘kala kala ke liye’ kaa naaraa diya jiske pravaktaaon main auskar wild kaa naam ullekhneey he
 The stylistic approach emphasizing purely aesthetic experience deeply influenced modern art forms in almost all fields
 lekin is andolan ke virodh kii dhvaniyaan mahaan roosi sahityakar liyo tolstoy kii rachana whot iz art? or america parinamwad ke pramukh pravaktaa jon divi kii kriti art ez experience main sunaayi deen
 Tolstoy argued that art that cannot communicate moral sensations among humans, however great it may be in terms of metaphorical criteria, cannot be appreciated
 divi ne bhi sampreshan kii bhoomika ke sawaal par rupvaad se loha lete hue kala ko saundaryashastra ke naam par uske daayre ke baahar maujuud anubhav kii sanrachanaon se kaat kar rakhane kaa virodh kiya
 The German tradition of aesthetic thinking continued into the twentieth century as well
 ghatnakriyashastra, vyakhyashastra or marxvad ke auzaaron kaa istemaal karke saundaryashastra sambandhi siddhanton ko or samrudh kiya gaya
 In 1936 Martin Heidegger wrote an essay like 'the Origin of the Work of Art' which is considered one of the best works of philosophy of art
 haidagar ne is niabandh main daawa kiya ki kala-kriti ko is jagat main sthit vastu ke rup main dekhnaa aadhuniktaa kii moolbhoot lakshanik trutiyon main se ek he
 According to Heidegger, art opens the doors of a new world, truth not only decreases in the form of art, it also inaugurates the existence of things in the realm of our own experience
 is tarah saundaryashastra ke madhyam se haidagar ne aadhuniktaa kii aalochana karte hue vastuon kii parmparik astitv-mimasaa or praudyogikeey vyakhya ko aade haathon liya
 By the mid-twentieth century, the utility of aesthetics began to be questioned
 sadi kii shuruyaat main diye gayi apane kuch vyakhyanon main edward bulo yah prashn puch chuke the ki kahin kala or saundarya kii paribhaashaayen kalakaar kii srijan- kshamta kaa kshay to nahin kar rahi hai
 These lectures were published in 1957 and in the sixties American artist Barnett Newman declared that the use of aesthetics is the same for art as that of ornithology for birds
 arthath saundaryashastra se anbhigya kalakaar hi acha he
 Under the study of culture, the oriented trends of aesthetics have been rigorously tested
 pier bordiyo ne samskruti ke samajashaastra ke tahat kala ke vichaardhaaratmak aadhaar kii na keval shinaakht kii balki yah bhi kaha ki isi kaaran se saundayshaastra apni hi saanskrithik or raajnneetik jadon kaa sandhan nahin kar paaya he
 Bordeaux's counterpoint to this idea is found in Adorno's work Aesthetic Theory
 adorno beesvin sadi kii avangaard kala kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki kala main abhi bhi vichaardhaara kaa pratwaad karne kii kshamta he
 According to Adorno, art is a product of its society, but its creation process also contains an autonomous moment from social determinism
 isliye vah kalakaar or uske darshak yaa pathak ko tatkaaleen prabhutvshaalee samskruti dwaara thamaye gayi taur- tareekon se itar sochane kaa mauka bhi detii he
 Some Marxist scholars have also tried to develop a Marxist category of aesthetics
 hindi ke pramukh marxvaadi saahityalochak namvar singh ne is tarah kii koshishon ko aalochanatmak drushti se dekhte hue iskaa pehla udhaaharan soviet sangh main ‘samaajawaadee yatharthwaad’ kaa shaastra-nirmaan mana he
 He has said, 'with the formation of scripture, social reality was also formulated and the style of expressing that reality too
 dekhte-dekhte ek nayaa ritivaad chal padaa, rachana main bhi, aalochana main bhi
 The country which had a socialist revolution, did not hesitate to make any revolution in the field of literature and art
 yatharth kaa aisa or itnaa apmaan to kranti ke pehle ke sahitya main bhi nahin hua tha or unnisvin sadi ke europe ke sahitya main bhi nahin jab burjwa kranti ne yatharthwaad ko janm diya tha
 The condition became very much like that of the literature-trend called Hindi rituals, when poems were being written keeping the characteristic texts of the rhetoric
 ’ Namvar Singh gives another example of a large treatise called Aesthetics by George Lukach
 ve ise lukach dwaara apane lagbhag saath varshon ke deergh sahitya-chintan ko antat ek vyavasthit shaastra main baandhane kaa viraat prayaas qaraar dete hai, ‘hazaron prishthon kaa yah vishaal granth abhi tak german bhashaa main hi uplabdh he or jo german acchhee tarah jaanate honge, vahi iske bare main kuch vishwaspurvak kah sakane main sakasham honge
 On the basis of what has been said about him so far in English and the impression he has received from his sporadic excerpts, it can be said that it has failed to try all the arts in 'imitation'
 is prakaar marxvaadi lukach jab sabhi kalaon ko ek shaastra main baandhane chalate hai to antat arestu kii sharan jane ko baadhya hote hai
 An English weekly reviewing this treatise had published a cartoon in which Aristotle's appearance and appearance with Lukach Marx's beard
 ’ namvar singh kii manyata he ki lukach ke drushtaant se marxvaadi saundaryashastra kii is lambi parampara kaa ek kamazor pahalu saamne aata he
 He says that 'often he himself failed to challenge an institution called' Kala 'and saw no harm in accepting the classical definition of art
 buniyadi rup main ek baar in paribhaashaon ko sweekaar kar lene ke baad to phir thode- bahut her-pher ke saath is-us kavi yaa kriti ke moolyankan kaa kaary hi shesh rahata he; or kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki marxvaadi saundaryashastriyon ne is kshetra main apni pratibha kaa johar bakhubi dikhaaya he— unchi samskruti ke bade-se- bade vichaarkon se hode lete hue
 The language of interpretation and evaluation is certainly materialistic as well as historical, but overall it is not very different from the dominant tradition

 He chose the Shavolin temple to teach this art

 But this does not prove that Kungfu is the only discovery of China

 With this view, castes in North India can be divided into five groups by keeping Brahmin at the center

 The third tradition is that raw food in the hands of all the upper castes is accepted
 sabhi jatiyaan pehali parampara main hai or anya jatiyaan saamanyat: baad ke niyamon kaa anusaran karti hai
 An untouchable caste accepts neither raw nor cooked food from the hand of another untouchable caste, although both types of food of the pure castes are acceptable to them
