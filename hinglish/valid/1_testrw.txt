 Warren Bennis has cited OD as a response to change, a complex pedagogical strategy that aims to change the beliefs, attitudes, values and structure of an organization, to enable them to develop new technologies, marketing and challenges, and self-change
 Can be better optimized with an astounding rate of
 OD is neither "any activity undertaken to improve an organization", nor is it "an organization's training function"; It is a specific type of change process to achieve a specific type of end result
 OD main vyavhaaraatmak vigyaan kii jaankaree kaa prayog karte hue sanghathan kii "prakriyaaon" main hastkshep karnaa tathaa saath hi sanghathanaatmak pratibimb, pranali sammilan, niyojan va swatah vishleshan shaamil ho saktaa he
 Kurt Lewin is primarily considered the founding father of OD, although he died before the concept became popular in the mid-1950s
 levin se samooh-gativigyaan or kaarywahi-anusandhan ke vichaar praapt hue jo buniyadi OD prakriya ko majbooti dete hai or saath hi iske liye sahyogpurn paraamarsh / upabhokta lokachar bhi pradaan karte hai

 sanghathan vikaas ek prageetishil kshetra he, jo sakaaratmak vayask vikaas sahit anek nai vichaardhaaraon ke prati pratikriyasheel he
 The concept of an organization, which is defined as two or more people working to achieve one or more common goals, is at the core of OD
 is sandarbh main vikaas yah dharna he ki samay bitne par ek sanghathan apane lakshyon kii prapti main adhik prabhavi ban saktaa he
 Long-range OD programs to improve the organization's problem solving and recycling processes, especially through more effective and collaborative management of organizational culture, often with the help of a change factor or catalyst and using the technology and theory of applied behavioral science
 Is an attempt
 haalanki vyavhaaraatmak vigyaan ne sanghathanaatmak vikaas ke adhyayan or prayog ke liye buniyadi aadhaar pradaan kiya he, lekin adhyayan ke nae or ubharate hue kshetron ne bhi apni upasthiti darj kii he
 Experts in system thinking, leadership studies, organizational leadership and organizational practice, whose approach is not only tied to behavioral science, but extends to a highly multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary method, have emerged as OD catalysts
 ye nae visheshgy drushtikon sanghathan ko ek anek pranaaliyon ke ek purnataavaadi paraspar prabhaav ke rup main dekhte hai, jiskaa prabhaav sampurna sanghathan kii prakriyaaon or parinaamon par padataa he
 More importantly, the term change factor or catalyst is synonymous with the idea of a leader who is involved in leadership, a transformational or efficacy process, as opposed to management, which is a more incremental and efficiency-based change mechanism
 sanghathan vikaas "ek parivartan kaarak tathaa ek praayojak sanghathan, jo sanghathanaatmak pradarshan main vruddhi tathaa swayan ko sudhaarney kii sanghathan kii kshamta main sudhaar ke liye ek system ke sandarbh main praayogic vyavhaaraatmak vigyaan kaa prayog karke tathaa yaa anya sanghathanaatmak parivartan drushtikon kaa prayog karne ke uddeshy se ek saath aate hai, ke bich ek anubandhatmak sambandh " he
 Organization development is a continuous, systematic process for implementing effective change in an organization
 sanghathan vikaas ko sanghathanaatmak parivartan kii samaj or prabandhan par kendrit praayogic vyavhaaraatmak vigyaan tathaa vaigyanik adhyayan or anveshan donon ke ek kshetra ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 It is interdisciplinary in nature and develops sociology, psychology and theories of motivation, practice and personality
 haalanki na to praayojak sanghathan or na hi parivartan kaarak sulajhaai ja rahi samasya yaa samasyaon ke yatharth swaroop ke prati shuru se hi sunishchit ho sakate hai or na hi is baat ke prati sunishchit ho sakate hai ki parivartan karkon kii sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa kab tak padegi, lekin in masalon par kisi pareekshanatmak samjhaute par pahunchnaa aavashyak hota he
 In general, the sponsoring organization needs to know what the primary plan of the change factor is, its own commitments in relation to the responsibility and personal commitments of the program and how much the change factor will charge
 The change factor must necessarily ensure that the organization's and especially senior management's commitment to change is sufficiently strong to support the self-analysis and personal involvement necessary for program success
 saamanytah donon ore upasthit anischitataaon ko dekhte hue, kisi bhi paksh ko kisi bhi samay anubandh se baahar nikalne kii anumati dene vaala ek samaapan samjhauta bhi shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Here the term change factor is not used in the sense of a technical expert in a functional area like accounting, production or finance
 vah ek vyavhaaraatmak vaigyanik hota he, jo yah jaanata ho ki kisi sanghathan main logon ko unki swayan kii samasyaon ko sulajhane ke liye kis prakaar taiyaar karnaa he
 His main strength lies in his deep knowledge of human behavior, which is supported by many intermediate techniques
 The change factor can be someone outside or inside the organization
 ek aantarik parivartan kaarak saamanytah karmchaariyon ke samooh main se hi koi vyakti hota he, jise vyavhaaraatmak vigyaan main tathaa OD kii madhyavarti praudyogiki main visheshgyata praapt ho
 bechhard ne anek maamalon kaa ullekh kiya he, jinke anusaar logon ko OD kaa prashikshan diya jaataa rahaa he or ve apane sanghathanon main lautakar parivartan kaaryon ko purna karne main safal rahe hai
 In the natural evolution of the change mechanism in the organization, it would appear to be an idealized method
 Mastery change factors can be found in the faculties of some universities, or they are private consultants associated with National Training Laboratories for Applied Behavioral Science University Associates, Department of Applied Human Sciences, Human Systems Intervention Graduate Program, Navitas Limited Limited) and other similar organizations Can
 parivartan kaarak sanghathan kaa koi karmchaaree yaa pankti sadsy ho saktaa he, jisane OD siddhant or takanic kaa adhyayan kiya ho
 aisi sthiti main, "anubandhatmak sambandh" ek aantarik samjhauta hota he, jo sambhawatah shulk ke atirikt isamen shaamil anya sabhi sthitiyon ke sandarbh main spasht hona chahie
 The OD program is initiated by an organization that has a problem
 This means that the senior management or someone authorized by the senior management is aware that a problem is present and has decided to seek help to resolve it
 yah manochikitsa ke prayog kaa ek pratyaksh udhaaharan he: upabhokta yaa mariz ko uski samasyaon ke hal ko dhundne main sahaayta maangane ke liye anivaary rup se ek sakriy bhoomika nibhaani chahie
 yah upabhokta sanghathan ke str par sahaayta ko sweekaar karne kii ichha kii ore suchit karata he or sanghathan ko ashwasan detaa he ki prabandhan sakriy rup se chintit he
 a key feature of OD, which distinguishes it from most other corrective programs, is that it is based on a "supportive relationship"
 kuch log maanate hai ki parivartan kaarak sanghathan kii bimariyon kaa upachaar karanevaala koi chikitsak nahin he; vah 'mariz' kaa pareekshan nahin karata, kisi rog kaa nidaan nahin karata or koi nuskhaa nahin likhata
 na hi vah sanghathan ke sadasyon ko gyaan ke kisi nae bhandar kii shiksha dene kaa prayaas karata he, jise ve baad main kaary-sthiti par sthanantarit karte hon
 parivartan kaarak kaa mukhya kaary audyogic / sansthanmak manovigyaan, audyogic samajashasre, samvaad, saanskrithik maanav-vigyaan, prashasnic siddhant, sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar, arthshaasre or raajnneeti vigyaan jaise vyavhaaraatmak shaasron se praapt kiye gayi siddhanton or vidhiyon kaa prayog karke sanghathan ko uski samasyaon ko paribhaashit karne or sulajhane main sahaayta pradaan karnaa he
 The basic method used in this is called action research
 yah vidhi, jiskaa varnan baad main kiya gaya he, samasya kii ek praathmik pahchaan, data sangrahan, upabhokta ko diye gayi data kaa feedback, upabhokta samooh dwaara data anveshan, data par aadhaarit kaary niyojan tathaa kaarywahi se milakar banati he
 OD refers to one aggregate system — an entire organization including the relevant environment — or to one or several subsystems — departments or task forces — in the context of an aggregate system
 tantron ke bhaagon, udaahranarth, vyaktiyon, guton, sanrachanaon, niyamon, mulyon or utpaadon par pruthak rup se vichaar nahin kiya jaataa; antarnirbharta ke siddhant, arthath pranali ke ek bhaag main parivartan anya bhaagon ko prabhavit karata he, kii puri tarah pahchaan kii jaati he
 Thus, OD interventions focus on the overall culture and cultural processes of organizations
 samoohon par bhi dhyaan kendrit kiya jaataa he kyonki sanghathanon or samoohon main vyaktiyon kaa praasangik vyavhaar saamanytah vyaktitv ke bajaay samuhik prabhaav kaa parinaam hota he
 The objective of OD is to improve the organization's ability to handle its internal and external functionality and relationships
 isamen vyaktiyon va samoohon ke bich unnat antahprakriyaayein, adhik prabhavi samvaad, sanghathan kii sabhi prakaar kii samasyaon kaa saamana kar paane kii kshamta main sudhaar, adhik prabhavi nirnay prakriyaayein, adhik upyukt netritv style, vinaashaatmak vivaad se nipatane main unnat kaushal or sanghathan ke sadasyon ke bich aapasi vishwaas or sahyog ke ucch-str aadi jaisi baaten shaamil hoti hai
 These objectives stem from a value system based on an optimistic view of human nature, according to which - in a supportive environment, a person is able to achieve higher levels of development and achievement
 vaigyanik vidhi- anveshan, kaarnon kii gahan chaanbin, anumaanon kaa prayogtmak pareekshan or parinaamon kii samiksha- sanghathan ke vikaas or prabhavakaarita ke liye aavashyak hai
 The ultimate goal of OD professionals to "let them do their own" by providing a set of tools, practices, approaches to the consumer organization and an action plan to monitor their own health and take corrective steps toward their own recycling and development it happens
 yah ek niamak or sudharatmak kriyavidhi ke rup main feedback kaa prayog karne kii system avadharana ke susangat hota he
 Kurt Levine played a key role in giving organization development its current form
 During the Second World War, Lewin conducted an experiment involving a collaborative change process, which was based on a three-stage process of planning, action, and measurement of results
 yah kaary anusandhan, jo ki OD kaa ek mahatvapurn tatv he, kaa purvavarti tha, jisaki charchaa baad main kii jaaegi
 iske baad levin prayogshaala prashikshan yaa T-samoohon kii sthapana main shaamil hue or 1947 main unki mrityu ke baad unke nikat sahaayakon ne uniwarsity of michigan main surveykshan-anusandhan vidhiyon ko viksit karne main sahaayta pradaan kii
 naishanal training laboratorys or puure desh main badhati hui sankhya main vishvavidhyalayon evam nijee salaahkaar sansthaaon main is kshetra kaa vikaas jari rahane ke kaaran ye vidhiyaan OD kii mahatvapurn bhaag ban gai The failure of off-site laboratory training to meet its initial assurances was one of the important forces encouraging the development of OD
 prayogshaala prashikshan kisi karyrat prashikshan samooh ke sadsy ke rup main ek vyakti ke "yahaan or abhi" anubhav ke dwaara seekhney kii prakriya he
 Generally such groups meet without any set schedule
 kisi aspasht kaalpanik sthiti ke prati sadasyon kii sahaj "yahaan or abhi" pratikriyaaon ke dwaara unhen swayan ke bare main sikhaanaa inkaa uddeshy hota he
 Problems of leadership, structure, status, communication and self-service behavior typically arise in such groups
 sadasyon ko swayan ke bare main kuch seekhney or shravan, dusron kaa avlokan karne or samooh ke prabhavi sadasyon ke rup main kaary karne kaa ek avasar miltaa he
 As previously followed, laboratory training was conducted in "stranger groups" or between groups consisting of individuals coming from different organizations, situations and backgrounds
 haalanki in "ajanabi prayogshaalaon" se praapt is gyaan ko "ghar lautne par" vaastavik sthitiyon main sthanantarit karne main ek badi samasya utpann hui
 iske liye do vibhinn samskritiyon, T-samooh ke ek apekshaakrit surakshit or rakshaatmak vaataavaran or apane paaramparik mulyon ke saath sanghathanaatmak vaataavaran ke len-dein, ke bich ek sthanantaran kii aavashyaktaa thi
 This prompted the early promoters of this type of training to apply it to "family groups" - that is, groups within the same organization
 prashikshan sthal ke sthaan main parivartan or is baat kaa bodh ho jane par ki samskruti kisi samooh ke sadasyon ko prabhavit karne vaala ek mahatvapurn kaarak he, sanghathan vikaas kii avadharana kaa udai hua
 Historical examples Cambridge Clinic found that they were having problems with their internal work relationships
 marijon kii dekh-rekh main in samasyaon ke sambhavit prabhaav ke prati chintit chikitsa nideshak ne ek sthaneey vishvavidhyalay ke ek sanghathanaatmak salaahkaar se sampark karke sahaayta maangi
 nideshkon, clinics prashaasak or salaahkaar ke bich ek praarambhik vaarta netritv, vivaad samaadhaan or nirnay prakriyaaon main samasyaon kii ore suchit karti hui prathit hui
 salaahkaar ne yah suzav diya ki data ekatrit kiya janaa chaiye taaki ek kaaryshil upachaar nirmit kiya ja sake
 clinics ke adhikariyon ne ise sweekaar kiya or prayogtmak rup se kaaryshil samjhaute kaa samaapan hua
 The consultant conducted a series of interviews, which included all members of the clinic's staff, medical directors and administrators
 iske baad salaahkaar ne vishisht samasya kshetron kii pahchaan karne ke liye saakshaatkaar data ko "praasangikrut " athwa sankshepit kiya
 About a week later, at the start of a workshop, the consultant again gave the clinic staff the data he had collected
 karmchaariyon ne samasyaon ko nimna praathamiktaaon main vyavasthit kiya The tensions that have been created due to role conflicts between specific members of the medical staff were causing disruption between the need to cooperate with the supervision of patients
 chikitsa nideshak kii netritv style ke parinamswaroop mahatvapurn kaaryon se jude masalon par unke nirnyon ko nirast karnaa padaa
 iske kaaran chikitsa or prashasnic karmchaariyon ke str par kabhi-kabhi niskriyata or bhram utpann hua
 Administrators, medical and external staff had a tendency to avoid mutual problems
 nitiyon or vidhiyon ko lekar khule vivaadon par is prakaar ankush lagata rahaa, lekin damit bhaawanaaon kaa antarvaiyaktik or antarsamuhik vyavhaar par spasht taur par ek nakaaratmak prabhaav pad rahaa tha
 Using role analysis and other techniques suggested by the consultant, clinic staff and medical directors were able to plan for effective ways to uncover and deal with role conflicts and leadership problems
 samvaad kaushal ko badhaane ke liye nirmit kaaryakramon or takaraav se nipatane ke liye ek kaaryshaala satr ke parinamswaroop puure clinics main adhik khulepan or vishwaas kaa vikaas hua
 An important result of this first workshop was the creation of an action plan that paved the way for specific steps to be applied to clinic problems by clinic staff during the resulting period
 salaahkaar ne in prayaason kaa nirikshan karne or yathasambhav sahaayta pradaan karne par sahmati vyakt kii
 nideshak or chikitsa tathaa prashasnic karmchaaree-dalon ke saath atirikt charchaaen or team vikaas satr yojit kiye gayi
 All the staff of the clinic were present in the second workshop held about two months after the first workshop
 In the second workshop, the staff at the clinic continued to work together on problems related to dealing with confrontation and interpersonal communication
 During the last half-day of the meeting, the staff developed a revised action plan incorporating improvement activities to be done in the coming weeks and months to improve the working relationship of the clinic
 is OD kaarykram kaa ek ullekhneey atirikt laabh yah tha ki clinics ke karmchaariyon ne ek sanghathan ke rup main clinics ke pradarshan kaa nirikshan karnaa or isaki kuch anya samasyaon se nipatna siikhaa
 chah maah baad, jab salaahkaar ne sanghathan kii ek nirantarata jaanch kii, to karmchaariyon ne is baat kii pushti kii ki antarvaiyaktik samasyaayein ab behatar niyantran ke adheen thim or OD kaarykram se judi do kaaryshaalaaon main sikhi gayi kuch takneekon kaa prayog abhi bhi kiya ja rahaa tha
 Organizational development is a system-level application and transfer of knowledge of behavioral sciences towards the planned development, improvement and repurposing of strategies, structure and process, which results in the efficacy of the organization
 - NUST- SEECS) To understand the organization, Wesboard has presented a six-step model: haal ke kuch varshon main, aadhunik sanghathanon main hone vaale parivartanon kaa prabandhan kar paane main OD kii praasangikta ko lekar gambhir prashn utpann hue hai
 The need for "re-invention" of the region has become a topic that some of its "founding fathers" are seriously discussing
 punavvishkaar or parivartan kii is maang ke saath hi, vidwaanon ne ek bhaavana-aadhaarit drushtikon se sanghathanaatmak vikaas kaa adhyayan prarambh kiya he
 For example, declerk has written about how emotional trauma can negatively affect performance
 aakaar ghataane, outsorcing, vilyon, punarnirmaan, satat parivartanon, niztaa par akraman, utpeedan or shakti ke durupyog ke kaaran anek karmchaaree aakraamakata, bechaini, ashanka, nirashavad or bhay kii bhaawanaaon kaa anubhav karte hai, jiske parinamswaroop unke pradarshan main kami aa sakati he
 Diklerk suggests that in order to treat trauma and improve performance, OD professionals must acknowledge the existence of trauma, provide employees with a safe place to discuss their feelings, identify the trauma, and It should be kept in perspective and after that it should be allowed to express and deal with emotional reactions
 One method of achieving this is to allow employees to portray what they think of the situation and then let them explain their portrayals to each other
 Drawing is beneficial because it allows employees to express feelings they would normally not be able to express in words
 With all, vendel el french or cesil bel sanghathan vikaas ko "kaarywahi anusandhan ke madhyam se sanghathan sudhaar" ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 If one of the ideas summarizing the underlying philosophy of OD is to be cited, it will be an idea of action research conceived by Kurt Levine and extended by other behavioral scientists
 Concerned with social changes and, more specifically, effective change, Levine believed that there was a strong connection between motivation and action for change: if people were active in the decisions affecting them, they would adopt new methods
 More likely to leave
 unhone kaha ki "tarksangat saamaajik prabandhan charnon ke ek chakra main aage badhata he, jinamein se prayek charan niyojan, kaarywahi or kaarywahi ke parinaam ke bare main tathyanveshan ke ek vrutt se milakar banataa he"
 Levine's description of this process involves three stages: "niyantran hataanaa": duvidha yaa asamanjas kaa saamana kar rahe vyakti yaa samooh ko is baat kaa bodh hota he ki parivartan kii aavashyaktaa he
 "change": The problem is diagnosed and new models of behavior are discovered and tested
 "punah niyantran": nae vyavhaar ke kriyanvayan kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he va yadi yah vichaaron ko adhik shaktishaalee bana rahaa ho, to ise apana liya jaataa he
 Figure 1 briefly summarizes the steps and processes involved in planned change through action research
 kaarywahi anusandhan ko parivartan kii ek chakree prakriya ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 The cycle begins with a series of planning actions initiated by the consumer and the change factor working together
 is charan ke pramukhr tatwon main ek praathmik nidaan, data sangrahan, parinaamon kaa feedback or sanyukt kaarywahi yojana shaamil hote hai
 In the language of system theory, it is the input stage, in which consumers become aware of problems that the system has not yet identified, realizing that effective changes may require external support and the process of problem diagnosis Share with the consultant
 kaarywahi anusandhan kaa doosraa charan kaarywahi yaa roopantaran charan hota he
 This phase involves actions related to learning processes and the planning and implementation of behavioral changes in the consumer organization
 jaisaa kii chitra 1 main darshaya gaya he, is charan main feedback ek feedback loop a ke madhyam se badhegaa or pichley niyojan ko parivartit karne main prabhavi hoga, taaki upabhokta pranali kii shikshan gatividhiyon kaa parivartan ke uddeshyon ke saath behatar dhang se milan kiya ja sake
 is charan main salaahkaar or upabhokta pranali ke sadasyon dwaara sanyukt rup se kii jane vaali kaarywahi-niyojan gatividhiyaan shaamil hoti hai
 After the workshop or teaching sessions, these action steps are completed during work as a part of the conversion phase
 kaarywahi anusandhan kaa teesraa charan output yaa parinaam charan hota he
 The actual changes in behavior due to the corrective action steps implemented after the second phase are included in this phase
 punah upabhokta pranali se data sangrahit kiya jaataa he, taaki pragati ko nirdhaarit kiya ja sake or shikshan gatividhiyon main aavashyak samaayojan kiye ja saken
 shikshan gatividhiyon main is prakaar ke chote samaayojan feedback loop b ke madhyam se kiye ja sakate hai 
 kaarykram main buniyadi parivartanon ke liye mukhya samaayojan or punarmoolyankan OD pariyojna ko punah pehle yaa niyojan charan par waapas le aate hai
 The action-research model shown in Figure 1 strongly follows Levin's iterative cycle of planning, action, and outcome measurement
 yah levin ke parivartan ke saamaanya model ke anya pahaluon ko bhi pradarshit karata he
 As indicated in the figure, the planning phase is the phase of control removal or problem awareness
 kaarywahi charan parivartan kaa charan hota he, arthath pranali kii samasyaon ko samajhane or unase nipatane ke ek prayaas ke rup main nae roopon or vyavhaar ke prayog kaa prayaas karnaa
 
 parinaam charan punarniyantran kaa daur hota he, jisamen kaary ke dauraan nae vyavhaaron kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he or yadi yah safal or prabhavi ho, to yah system ke samasya-samaadhaan vyavhaar ke khazaane kaa ek bhaag ban jaataa he
 Action research is problem focused, consumer focused and action oriented
 isamen upabhokta pranali main ek nidaan, sakriy-shikshan, samasya-kii-khoj or samasya-samaadhaan prakriya shaamil hoti he
 Data is not simply returned as a written report, but in open sessions, and consumers and change factors identify and categorize specific problems, find their real causes, and realistically and experimentally
 Work together to develop plans to deal with forms
 phir bhi data sangrahan, anumaanon kaa nirmaan, anumaanon kaa pareekshan or parinaamon ke maapan ke rup main vaigyanik vidhi, haalanki utane gahan rup se nahin, jitna prayogshaala main kii jaati he, is prakriya kaa ek ekikrut bhaag nahin he
 Action Research is also actively pursuing a long-range, cyclical, self-corrective mechanism to maintain and enhance the efficacy of consumer systems while leaving the system with experimental and useful tools for self-analysis and self-recycling
 Determines
 "hastkshep" sanghathan vikaas ke "kaarywahi" charan main mukhya shikshan prakriyaayein hai
 Interventions are structured activities that are used singly or in combination with members of the consumer system to enhance their social or work performance
 They can be presented as a part of an improvement program by a change factor or they can be used by the consumer to examine the health status of the organization or to implement the necessary changes in their own behavior
 The latter can be done
 "sanrachit gatividhiyaan" arthath aisi vividh vidhiyaan jaise prayogtmak abhyaas, prashnawaliyaan, drushtikon surveykshan, saakshaatkaar, praasangik samooh charchaaen or yahaan tak ki bhojan-kaal ke dauraan parivartan kaarak or upabhokta sanghathan ke sadsy ke bich hone vaali baithken
 ek parivartan kaarak-upabhokta pranali sambandh main sanghathan ke sudhaar kaarykram ko prabhavit karne vaale prayek kaary ko ek hastkshep kaha ja saktaa he
 There are several possible intervention strategies from which to choose
 kisi vishisht ranneeti ke chayan ke dauraan sanghathanon ke swaroop or karypranali ke bare main anek anumaan lagaae jate hai
 Backhard lists six such estimates: hastkshep vyaktiyon kii prabhavakaarita ko badhaane ke liye dizine kiye gayi hastkshepon se lekar un hastkshepon tak faile hote hai, jo tiimon or samoohon, antarsamuhik sambandhon or sakal sanghathan se nipatane ke liye dizine kiye gayi hote hai
 Some interventions are those which are focused on work related issues and some are those which are focused on process related issues
 antat hastkshepon ko mote taur par is aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he ki ve kis parivartan kriyavidhi ko mahatv dete hai: udaahranarth, feedback, parivartan ke saanskrithik niyamon ke prati jaagrukta, antahkriya or samvaad, takaraav or nae gyaan yaa kaushal ke abhyaas dwaara prashikshan
 Helping to create a safe environment for learning and change in the consumer system is one of the most difficult tasks that the change factor has to face
 ek anukool vaataavaran main, maanviya prashikshan swayan par nirmit hota he or ek vyakti ke jivan-kaal main lagaataar jari rahata he
 As this cycle progresses to new levels, new behavior creates new dilemmas and problems
 iske vipareet, ek pratikul vaataavaran main, prashikshan bahut kam nishchit hota he or ek manovaigyanik aatank ke vaataavaran main yah aksar puri tarah ruuk jaataa he
 Dismantling of outdated practices in the organization may be opposed as employees in this environment feel that it is inappropriate to express their true feelings, although such disclosures may be creative
 atah ek virodhpurna vaataavaran main aavashyak feedback uplabdh nahin hota
 saath hi, nai paddatiyon ke prayog kaa prayaas karnaa jokhimpurna mana ja saktaa he kyonki yah sthapit niyamon kaa ulanghan karata he
 Such an organization may also be bound by the rules of its systems: if one part changes, the other parts will also join it
 Therefore it is easier to maintain the status quo
 padanukramik praadhikaar, visheshgyata, niyantran kaa vistaar or aupchaarik tantra kii anya visheshtaayen bhi prayog ko hatotsahit karti hai
 The change factor must focus on all these dangers and barriers themselves: Some of the things which may be helpful for them are: team nirmaan, prashikshan, bade samooh hastkshep, paraamarsh, pradarshan samiksha, aakaar main kami, TQM evam netritv vikaas hastkshep ke kuch udhaaharan hai

 bihar main satsang kaa kaary ab din prati-din badhata hi gaya
 In 35 years Babu Rajeshwari Prasad Singh ji, who was a good vassal, passed through Bihar after reading this "instrument"

 Etah came and saw Maharaj Ji, learned the function of Bhajan

 Then he preached in Bihar with the permission of Shri Gurudev
 aaj sara bihar is aatm-vidya se ot-prot ho rahaa he
 Gurudev had such a blessing that today this satsang spread all over Bihar and Bengal on a good scale and hundreds of women are taking advantage of spirituality today
 uttar pradesh main pahile se hi praayah sabhi shaharon main kendra khul gayi the
 Babu Sadonarayan ji, an advocate from Jaipur, the lawyer was returning from Allahabad, he was studying some "medium" in the railways and you also took and read from him

 In response, you wrote - i am not a monk, i am a planetary, you first come to us and then i will be able to come here
 bas phir kya tha vah eta pahunche or kuch samay uparant aap bhi jaipur padhaare
 In this way, the lawyer made an attempt to bring Ganga in the form of joy, by becoming Bhagiratha, so that today entire Rajasthan is enjoying this knowledge Ganga
 iske baad har saal aap jaipur aane lage, bhandara prarambh hua
 Hundreds of big and small people started taking advantage of satsang in Rajasthan
 bhandare main bhi saare bharatvarsh se sahasron kii sankhya main log aane lage
 Instead of Basant Panchami, the second year's bhandara was made on the big day holiday, which continued in Ate till 1950
 jab satsang adhik badha- dur-dur ke jigyaasu eta aane lage to to eta main rail ke na hone se aane jane vaale satsangiyon ko kathinaayee hoti thi
 There were private salaries, at that time there were no government buses either
 logon ko anek ksht hone lage, raaton-raat padaa rahanaa padataa tha
 Many times it happened that due to not getting a ride from many Satsangi Shikohabad of Bihar reached Etah with its bed head on it, your heart melted and it was intended that you should move from here to where people can come and stay, etc

 bas mathura kaa aana nishchay ho gaya or san 1951 ke oktober maas main aap mathura aa gaye
 There was more talk here and within four or five years countless lovers started coming to Mathura
 jigyaasuon ko aisa prathit hone laga ki bhagwaan krishna phir apane janm sthaan main gita kaa sundar upadesh dene ke liye padhaare hai

 There he also said that i have got great peace here, Paramhans ji has also been seen and one day he should have remained in the tomb for about ten hours
 us samay jitne premi saath the sab kii ajeeb dasha thi ek adbhut khinchaav tha jo varnan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He was the embodiment of stamina and seriousness, always laughing and remaining calm
 unke andar kaa bhed koi puraa nahin jaan paaya
 He was a repository of learning
 kisi ne jo kuch poocha vahi saralata se samajhakar batalaaya
 All his work was to remove the pride of the practitioner, and whenever he saw that pride came, immediately warned him
 jahaan dekha ki koi galati kisi se hui kabhi hans kar, kabhi daantkar use bataa dete
 He used to recognize pride immediately
 vah kehete bhi the ki guru kaa kaary or kuch nahin he keval shishy ko abhimaan se bachaaye rakhana he
 You used to say pride to others, sometimes to others
 aap kehete the -”hameshaa shishy ko chahie ki vah guru ko saath lekar bole, kabhi apane guru ko mat bhuulo
 It is the Guru who gives his knowledge to others through you
 yadi tumko is par apana abhimaan he to vah galat he
 It will not affect others
 satsang to koi or hi karaata he
 Till today i have never considered forgetting that i conduct satsang

 She comes daily in our satsang

 "I felt very happy that my prayer was accepted

 This description has also come in yoga-shastra and sometimes in the Upanishads, but without explaining to an experienced guru, i do not understand it properly

 Was afraid to sit in front, what would you say if bad feelings of your mind would come in front of them
 parantu itani gambheertha tha ki abhi yah nahin kaha ki tum main yah dosha he
 Those who come to eat and come, the educated moralists also come, but never say anything about someone's character
 bas yahi kehete ki bhagwaan kaa dhyaan karo or hamaare bataae hue saadhan ko isi tarah karo jaise bataaya jaay, yah saare dosha to swatah hi dur ho jaaenge
 What is the magic that does not speak on the head? is prakaar ke anek saadhan jo jiske liye uchit hota bataake saadhan main laga dete the
 That is why we as a person of religion used to understand them as our own, their cultivation was not for any community, it was for human society

 That is why all the sects like hindu-muslim-sikh-jain etc
 adopted their education
 is andhere yug main vah padhe-likhe log jo ishwar ko maanate hi nahin the, dharm ke naam kii khilli udaate the, sadmarg main lag gaye or ek naveen prakaash paa kritakruty ho gayi

 While living in the household, we have to put ourselves on the path of God, the householder can do all his practical work and worship the Lord and get God
 aap kehete the tum 23 ghante sansar ke kaary karo parantu ek ghante ishwar kii ore do or phir sansar ko utani der ke liye bhul jaao
 You used to say that meet someone who has seen God, only he can make you see God
 aapaki sadhana mukhyatah karm ,upasna or gyaan kii miloni he
 By adopting this, the inquisitive gets reputed in a short time, which is the real experimental form of Gita
 isi liye yah drushtaa saadhan bhi kehalaata he
 Any worshiper of any faith can do this sadhana and there is no bond of any religion, caste and country
 aaj lakhon sankhya main jigyaasu bhai - bahan isko apanaakar aadhyatmik laabh le rahen he
 We could not understand in the shadow of such a saint whether darkness could ever come again? Can this joy sometimes be different from us and may such a great man also be estranged? But the time has come to make us fully aware of their light
 kyonki surya ke na rahane par hi prakaash kaa bodh hota he
 We could not recognize him in the glare of his light
