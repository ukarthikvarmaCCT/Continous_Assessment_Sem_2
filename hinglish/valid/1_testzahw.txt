 The title of this novel is taken from a translation of the poem "kabul" composed by the 17th century Iranian poet Saib Tabrizi: Oh, the beautiful city of Kabul wears a rugged mountain skirt,and the rose is jealous of its lash-like thorns
the dust of Kabul's blowing soil smarts lightly in my eyes,but i love her, for knowledge and love both come from her dust
 i sing bright praises to her colorful tulips, the beauty of her trees makes me blush
 How sparkling the water flows from pul-i-mastaan! May Allah protect such beauty from the evil eye of man! Khizr chose Kabul to paradise,for her mountains brought him near to heaven's delights
the fort's dragon-sprawling walls guard the city well,each brick is more precious than the treasure of Shayagan
 Every street in Kabul fascinates the eye
in the bazaars, Egypt's caravans pass by
no one can count the beauteous moons on her rooftops, 'and hundreds of lovely suns hide behind her walls
' Her morning's laugh is as gay as flowers, Her dark nights shine like beautiful hair
 Her tuneful nightingales sing with flame in their notes, Fiery songs like burning leaves, fall from their throats
 i sing to the gardens, Jahanara and sharbara
even the tuba of Paradise is jealous of their greenery

 data mining data se pattern nikaalane kii prakriya he
 As more data is being collected, with the amount of data doubling every three years, data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool for converting these data into information
 saamaanya rup se ise vistrut vyavhaaron kii ruparekha banane main prayog kiya jaataa he, jaise vipanan, nigaraanee, dhokhadhadi pahchaan or vaigyanik khoj
 While data mining can be used to uncover patterns in data samples, it is also important to know that using non-representative samples of data can produce results that are not suggestive of the domain
 isi tarah, data mining un pattern kaa pataa nahin lagayegaa jo domen main maujuud ho sakate hai, agar ve pattern us namoonay main maujuud nahin hai jisaki "mining" ho rahi he
 There is a trend among insufficiently knowledgeable "consumers" of results who see the "magical potential" for "data mining" and take this technology as a clear-cut medium similar to a crystal ball
 kisi bhi anya upkaran kii tarah, yah uchit kachi saamagree ke sahyojan main hi kaary karata he: is maamle main suchak or pratinidhi data jise upyogkarta dwaara pehle jamaa karnaa hoga
 iske alaava, data ke ek vishesh set main ek khaas pattern kii khoj jaruri nahin ki pattern kii us puri aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv kare jisase data liya gaya he
 Therefore, an important part of this process is pattern verification and authentication on other samples of data
 data mining shabd kaa ek sambandhit lekin nakaaratmak arth main bhi prayog kiya gaya he, jahaan yah badi sankhya ke data main spasht lekin jaruri nahin pratinidhi pattern kii suvichaarit khoj, ko ingit karata he
 To avoid confusion with the second sense, the terms data dredging and data snooping are often used
 dhyaan den, ki dreging or snooping ko jab pariklpana ko viksit or spasht kiya ja rahaa ho to ek anveshan ke upkaran ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Humans have been extracting patterns from data "by hand" for centuries, but the increasing amount of data in modern times has made more automated methods necessary

 computer praudyogiki kaa prasar, sarvavyaapaktaa or badhati shakti ne data sangrahan or bhandaaran ko badha diya he
 As data sets have grown in size and complexity, direct real-time data analysis has been increasingly augmented by indirect, automated data processing
 computer vigyaan main anya khojon dwaara ise or badhaava mila he, jaise neural network, clustering, genetic elgoridam, disizan tree or saport vector mashin 
 data mining, chhipe pattern ko udghaatit karne ke iraade se data par in tareekon ko lagu karne kii prakriya he
 For years it has been used by industry, scientists and governments to filter the amount of data such as supermarket scanner data to generate aircraft passenger travel records, census data and market research reports
 
 vyavhaar ke nishkarshon ke sangrah ke vishleshan main sahaayta, data mining ke upyog kaa ek mukhya kaaran he
 Such data are sensitive to collinearity due to unknown interrelationships
 data mining kaa ek aprihaary tathy yah he ki vishleshit kiye ja rahe set ke aankade puure domen ke pratinidhi nahin bhi ho sakate hai or isliye ho saktaa he ki isamen kuch mahatvapurn sambandhon or vyavhaaron ke udhaaharan shaamil naa hon jo domen ke anya bhaagon main maujuud hai
 To solve this type of problem, analysis is solved using experiment-based and other methods, such as choice modeling for human-generated data

 There have been some attempts to define standards for data mining, for example the 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining and the 2004 Java Data Mining Standards
 These are evolving standards; Later versions of these standards are still under development
 maanakeekaran ke in prayaason se mukt, khule-strot ke swatantra rup se uplabdh software system jaise rapidminer, Weka, KNIME or r Project, data mining prakriyaaon ko paribhaashit karne ke liye ek anaupchaarik maanak ban gaye hai
 Most of these systems are capable of importing and exporting models into PMML that provide a standard way to present data mining models so that they can be shared between different statistical applications
 PMML is an xml-based language developed by Data Mining Group, an independent group of several data mining companies
 PMML sanskaran 4

 In addition to industry-induced demand for standards and intraoperability, professional and educational activities have also contributed substantially to the development and precision of methods and models; The article, published in the 2008 issue of the International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, summarizes the results of a literature survey that identifies and analyzes this development
 is kshetra main pramukh vyavsaayik sanghathan he association for computing mashinaris special interest group on nolej discovery and data mining 
 1989 se unhone ek vaarshik antarrashtriya sammelan kaa aayojan kiya he or uski kaarywahi ko prakashit kiya he, or 1999 ke baad se "SIGKDD Explorations" naamak ek ardhvarshik academik patrika prakashit kii he
 Other science conferences on computer data mining include: nolej discovery in databeses, dilachasp, vishleshit, upyogi or naveen data ko khojane kii prakriya ke varnan ke liye, 1989 main gregory piyatetski-shapiro dwaara gadha gaya naam tha
 There are many nuances in this process, but broadly its steps are to preprocess the raw data, mine the data and interpret the results
 ek baar KDD prakriya kaa uddeshy gyaat hone ke baad, ek lakshya data set ekatrit kiya janaa chahie he
 Since data mining can only reveal patterns already present in the data, the target data set should be large enough to contain these patterns while being so brief that it can be mined within an acceptable time frame
 a common source for data is a datamart or data warehouse
 nirdhaarit lakshya ko tab saaf kiya jaataa he
 Cleansing removes comments with noise and missing data
 saaf data ko feechar vector main parinat kiya jaataa he, prati prekshan ek vector
 ek feechar vector, kachche data prekshan kaa ek sankshipt sanskaran he
 For example, a black and white image of a face that is 100px by 100px would contain 10,000 bits of raw data
 It can be converted into a feature vector by detecting the eye and mouth in the image
 aisa karne se prayek vector ke liye data kam hokar 10,000 bits se loketions ke liye teen code hoga, naatakeey rup se mine kiye jane vaale dataset ke aakaar ko kam karegaa or is tarah prasanskaran ke kaary ko kam karegaa
 chaynit feechar is par nirbhar karegaa ki uddeshy kya he ; jaahir he, "sahi" feechar kaa chunaav safal data mining ke liye aadhaar he
 The feature vectors are divided into two sets, "training set" and "test set"
 The training set is used to train the data mining algorithm, while the test set is used to verify the accuracy of any received pattern
 data mining main saamaanya rup se chaar virgon ke kaary shaamil hai: The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify patterns generated by data mining algorithms that occur in a broader data set
 data mining elgoridam dwaara paae gaye sabhi pattern jaruri nahin ki sahi hon
 data mining elgoridam ke liye prashikshan set main pattern kaa pataa lagaana aam he jo saamaanya data set main maujuud nahin hai, ise overfiting kaha jaataa he
 To overcome this, evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained
 larnt pattern ko is pareekshan set par lagu kiya jaataa he jiske praapt parinaam ko vaanchit parinaam se tulana kii jaati he
 For example, a data mining algorithm that is trying to separate legitimate emails from spam will be trained on a training set of sample emails
 Once trained, the learned pattern will be applied to a test set of emails on which it was not trained, the accuracy of these patterns can be measured by how many emails they have correctly classified
 
 elgorithm ke moolyankan ke liye kai sankhyikeey tareekon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he jaise ROC karvs
 If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, it is necessary to reevaluate and change the preprocessing and data mining

 Beginning in the 1960s, with the availability of oracles for some mixed games, also known as tablebases, in some early configurations, small board dots-and-boxes, small board hexes and some endgame, dots-end in chess
 -boxes and hexes; a new area for data mining has opened up with
 yah, in orikkal se maanav upyogi ranneeti kaa nishkarshan he
 Existing pattern recognition methods do not have the required high degree of separation to be implemented successfully
 Instead, in conjunction with an in-depth study of tablebase answers to well-designed problems, extensive experiments with tablebases and prior art knowledge, that is, with prior tablebase knowledge, are used to generate practical patterns in dots
 Berlenkamp in end-boxes and John Nunn in chess endgames are examples of leading researchers doing this work, although they generate tablebase Is not included

 Businesses adopting data mining may see a return or investment, but they also see that the number of predictive models can grow exponentially
 koun sa graahak pratikriya degaa yah bataane ke liye ek model ke bajaay, ek udyog prayek kshetra or graahak prakaar ke liye ek alag model bana saktaa he
 Instead of sending an offer to all possible people who respond, he would like to send the offer only to customers who are likely to take the offer
 And finally, he would also like to decide which customers will be profitable over a time period and only send offers to those who are likely to be profitable

 Although the methods may vary with players and situations, the most common technique is outlined as follows: khilaadi tokari kii ore munh kiye hue kandhe kii chaudaai ke baraabar pair failaakar, ghutane ko thodaa modakar or peeth ko sidhaa rakhte hue khadaa hota he
 The player places the ball slightly above the head on the fingers of the dominant hand, while the other hand supports the ball sideways
 gend ko nishane par rakhane ke liye, agr bahu ko tokari kii disha main rakhte hue, khilaadi kii kohni, khadey rup se ek sidh main honi chahie
mude ghutanon ko failaate hue or shooting haath ko sidhaa karte hue gend ko phenkaa jaataa he; gend ungaliyon ke poron se ghoomte hue jaati he, jabaki kalai purna neeche kii ore gaman ko puraa karti he
 The shooting arm is held steady for a moment after throwing the ball with a full spread, while the wrist is fully bent and the fingers pointing downward, known as the follow through
 Doing it correctly increases shot accuracy
 aam taur par, gair-shooting haath kaa prayog shot ko keval disha dene ke liye kiya jaataa he, us par bal dene ke liye nahin
 Often players attempt to put a steady backspin on the rim to slow the impact of the ball
 shot kaa adarsh prakshep-path kinchit vivaad-yogya he, lekin aam taur par coach uchit chaap kii sifaarish karte hai
 Players can either shoot directly into the basket or redirect the ball to the basket using the backboard
 upar varnit paddati kaa prayog karne vaale do sabase aam shot hai, set shot or jamp shot 
set shot khadey posishan se kiya jaataa he, jisamen donon pair zamin par hi rahete hai or aam taur par iskaa istemaal free thro ke liye hota he
 Jump shot is made by bouncing in the air when the ball is thrown from the top height of the jump
 isse apekshaakrit adhik jor or vistaar miltaa he or saath hi, isse khilaadi ko difender se oonche hone kaa mauqaa miltaa he
 Failure to throw the ball before the foot is back on the ground is considered a travel violation
 ek anya aam shot he leap 
 is shot main khilaadi ko tokari kii ore gatisheel rahane kii aavashyaktaa he or gend ko tokari ke andar "le" "ap" karnaa hota he or aam taur par bechboard se hat kar 
bheed ke liye sabase adhik aanandadaayak or aam taur par sarvocch-pratishat sateek shot he slam dank, jisamen khilaadi bahut oonchi chalaang lagaataa he or gend ko neeche kii ore phenkata he, sidhe ghere ke aar-paar
 Another shot that is becoming more common is the "circus shot"
 a circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is shot by the shooter while unbalanced in the air, coming down and / or turning away from the basket, bouncing, or circling
 ek shot, jo rim or bechboard donon se puri tarah se chook jaataa he, air ball kehalaata he
 One particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jokingly called a brick
 ribounding kaa uddeshy ek free thro yaa field gol ke chook jane ke baad safaltaapurvak basketbaal kaa adhikaar praapt karnaa he, kyonki vah ghere yaa bechboard se palatataa he
 This plays a major role in the game, as most possession are eliminated after a team misses a shot
 ribound kii do shreniyan hai: aakraamak ribound, jisamen gend aakraamak paksh dwaara baraamad kii jaati he or qabja badalata nahin he or rakshaatmak ribound, jisamen bachaav team, mukt gend par punah qabja jamaati he
 Most rebounds are defensive, since the team that is in defense is in a better position to recover a missed shot
 khilaadiyon ke bich gend ko pahunchane kii vidhi ko paas kehete hai
 When giving most passes, a step is taken for strength boost and the hands move to ensure accuracy
 ek pramukh paas chest paas he
 The ball goes directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest
 ek uchit chest paas main, veg badhaane ke liye anguuthe baahar kii ore tadakate hai or dephence ko pratikriya kaa mauqaa nahin miltaa
 Another type of pass is a bounce pass
 In this, the passer bounces the ball from his chest to the receiver's chest and takes it two-thirds of the distance
 gend court par girti he or resiver kii ore chali jaati he
 The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also difficult for the opposing team to intercept
 Thus, players often use bounce passes on crowded occasions or to pass a defender
 overhead paas kaa prayog ek difender ke upar se gend paas karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The ball is released from above the passer's head
 outlet paas tab kiya jaataa he, jab ek team ko difensive ribound miltaa he
 The next pass after rebound is the outlet pass
 kisi bhi achche paas kaa mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki ise rokna mushkil hota he
 Good passers pass the ball with great accuracy and know exactly where each of their teammates likes to get the ball
 aisa karne kaa ek vishesh tareeqa he, praapt karne vaale saathi ko bina dekhe gend paas karnaa
ise kaha jaataa he no luk paas Another advanced style of passing is the behind the back pass, which, according to its name, involves a passer throwing a ball to a teammate in the back
 haalanki kuch khilaadi aise paas ko prabhavi dhang se kar sakate hai, tathaapi kai prashikshak no-luk yaa bihaind da back paas ko protsaahit nahin karte, unka maananaa he ki ise niyantrit karnaa mushkil he or isamen turnovers yaa ulanghan kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The act of continuously bouncing the ball with one hand is called dribbling and for a player to step up with the ball, it is an expectation
 drible karne ke liye, ek khilaadi gend ko hatheli se maarane ke bajaae ungaliyon se zamin kii ore neeche dhakka detaa he; yah adhik niyantran sunishchit karata he
 When dribbling and passing in front of an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with his hands at the maximum distance from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get the ball
 Therefore it is important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands
 achche drible karne vaale gend ko bhoomi par kam uchhaalate hai, jisase gend kii haath se zamin tak kii yatra main duuri kam ho jaati he or isse difender ke liye gend "churaana" or adhik kathin ho jaataa he
 Good ball operators dribble from behind their backs, between their legs, and suddenly change direction, creating an unintelligible dribbling method that makes it more difficult to defend against
 yah crossover kehalaata he, jo dribling karte hue difender se aage nikalne kaa sabase prabhavi tareeqa he
 a skilled player can dribble the ball without seeing it, using dribble speed or peripheral vision to keep track of the ball's position
 gend par dhyaan kendrit karne kii aavashyaktaa naa hone par ek khilaadi team ke saathiyon ko yaa ank arjeet karne ke mauqon ko dekh saktaa he, saath hi saath, apane paas se kisi or dwaara gend chura liye jane ke khatare ko taal saktaa he
 a block is executed when, after a shot attempt, a defender succeeds in converting the shot by touching the ball
 khel ke lagbhag sabhi sanskarnon main, jab gend apane daayre se neeche ke raste main ho, gend ko choona avaidh he; yah goltending ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 It is also illegal to block a shot after touching the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim
 ek shot ko block karne ke liye ek khilaadi ko, jis oonchai se shot chhuti he usase adhik upar tak pahunchane main sakasham hona hoga
 is prakaar, blocking main oonchai ek laabh ke rup main ho sakati he
 Players who are taller and typically play at the power forward or center position register more blocks than shorter taller players playing at guard positions
 haalanki, achche samay-prabandhan or paryaapt ucch urdhwadhar chalaang ke dwaara, chote qad ke khilaadi bhi prabhavi shot blowers ho sakate hai
 At the professional level, most male players are above 6 feet 3 inches and most women above 5 feet 7 inches
 Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball handling skills are important, are usually the shortest players
 purush pro lig main lagbhag sabhi forward 6 feet 6 inch yaa lambey hai
 Most centers are longer than 6 feet 10 inches
 sabhi NBA tiimon ko die gaye surveykshan ke anusaar, sabhi NBA khilaadiyon kii ausat oonchai bas 6 feet 7 inch ke neeche he or ausat vazan 222 pound ke qareeb

 Vaidyanath Temple is a Jyotirlinga Puranic temple in Deoghar Dwadash Jyotirlinga, which is located in the famous state of Deoghar in the state of Jharkhand, India
 pavitra tirth hone ke kaaran log ise vaidyanath dham bhi kehete hai
 The place where this temple is located is called "deoghar" i
e
 the house of the gods
 baidhnath jyotirling sthit hone ke kaaran is sthaan ko devgarh naam mila he
 This Jyotirlinga is a Siddhapeeth
 kaha jaataa he ki yahan par aane waalon kii sari manokamanaayen purna hoti hai
 For this reason this penis is also called "kamna Ling"
 is ling kii sthapana kaa itihaas yah he ki ek baar rakshasraj ravan ne himalay par jaakar shivaji kii prasannataa ke liye ghor tapasya kii or apane sir kaat-katkar shivlinga par chadhaane shuru kar diye
 After offering nine heads one by one, even the tenth head was to be cut off that Shiva appeared pleased
 unhone uske dason sir jyon-ke-tyon kar diye or usase vardaan maangane ko kaha
 Ravana went to Lanka and asked for the order to take him to establish that gender
 shivaji ne anumati to de di, par is chetavanee ke saath di ki yadi maarg main ise prithvi par rakh degaa to vah vahiin achal ho jayega
 Ultimately the same thing happened
 ravan shivlinga lekar chalaa par maarg main ek chitabhumi aane par use laghushanka nivritti kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Ravana took that gender to a Ahir and went to retirement
 idhar us ahir se use bahut adhik baari anubhav kar bhoomi par rakh diya
 What was then, Ravana could not uproot him even after returning full force and disappointed, went to Lanka by thumbing his thumb on the idol
 idhar brahma, vishnu aadi devataaon ne aakar us shivlinga kii puja kii
 As soon as Lord Shiva appeared, all the Gods and Goddess Shivalinga replaced him there and went back to heaven, praising Shiva
 janashruti va lok-manyata ke anusaar yah vaidyanath-jyotirlig manovanchit fal dene vaala he
 Deoghar literally means the abode of gods and goddesses
 devgarh main baba bholenath kaa atyant pavitra or bhavy mandir sthit he
 The Sravana Mela is held every year in the month of Sawan in which lakhs of devotees chant "bol-bomb!" "bol-bomb!" Baba comes to see Bholenath while chanting
 ye sabhi shraddhalu sultanganj se pavitra ganga kaa jal lekar lagbhag sau kilometre kii atyant kathin paidal yatra kar baba ko jal chadhaate hai
 a huge pond is also located near the temple
 baba baidhnath kaa mukhya mandir sabase purana he jiske aasapaas anek anya mandir bhi bane hue hai
 The temple of Baba Bholenath is connected to the temple of Goddess Parvati
 baidhnath dham kii pavitra yatra shravan maas main shuru hoti he
 First the pilgrims gather in Sultanganj where they fill the holy Ganges water in their vessels
 iske baad ve gangaajal ko apni-apni kaanvar main rakhkar baidhnath dham or basukinath kii ore badhate hai
 While carrying holy water, care is taken that the vessel which contains water, should not be anywhere near the land
 vasukinath apane shiv mandir ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The visit to the Vaidyanath temple is considered incomplete until the darshan at Vasukinath
 yah mandir devgarh se 42 kilometre dur jarmundi gaanv ke paas sthit he
 Various forms of local art can be seen here

 The linga of Lord Shiva is installed in each temple
 bharat ke 12 jyotirlingon main jharkhand ke devgarh jile main sthit vaidyanath jyotirling shaamil he
 Trishul is seen on the top of all Shiva temples of the world, but Shiva, Parvati, lakshmi-narayan and all other temples in the Vaidyanathdham complex have Panchshul on the top
 kaha jaataa he ki ravan panchashul se hi apane rajya lanka kii suraksha karata tha
 Since Vaidyanath had brought Ravana from Kailash to take Jyotirlinga to Lanka, but the creator had some other approval
 jyotirling le jane kii shartt yah thi ki bich main ise kahin nahin rakhana he magar dev yoga se ravan ko laghushanka kaa teevr veg asahansheel ho gaya or vah jyotirling ko bhagwaan ke badale hue charvaahe ke rup ko dekar laghushanka karne laga
 That shepherd placed the Jyotirlinga on the ground
 is tarah charvaahe ke naam vaidyanath par vaidyanathdham kaa nirmaan hua
 Here every year, 2 days before Mahashivaratri, Panchshul is removed from the temples of Baba temple, Maa Parvati and lakshmi-narayan
 is dauraan panchashul ko sparsh karne ke liye bhakton kii bheed umad padati he
 As you will see in the pictures below
 vaidyanathdham parisar main sthit anya mandiron ke sheersh par sthit panchshulon ko mahashivaratri ke kuch dinon purv hi utaar liya jaataa he
 They are specially worshiped a day before Mahashivaratri by bringing down all the Panchshulas and then all the Panchshulas are placed in place at the temples
 is dauraan baba va parvati mandiron ke gathbandhan ko hataa diya jaataa he
 a new alliance is made on the day of Mahashivaratri
 gathbandhan ke laal pavitra kapade ko praapt karne ke liye bhi bhakton kii bheed umad padati he
 During Mahashivratri, many pilgrims reach Vaidyanathdham from Sultanganj across Kanwar by walking 105 km across Ganga water and chanting 'bol Bomb'

 Tripitak abhidhammpitak ek buddha granth he
 It is one of the three texts that make the Tripitaka
 is granth main vishleshanyukt deshna or dharmik vyakhya sangrahit he
 The tradition states that the Buddha thought Abhidhamma immediately after his enlightenment, then taught the gods a few years later
 baad main buddha ne ise sariputta ko doharaaya, jisane ise apane shishyon ko saunp diya
 This tradition is also evident in the parivar, the very late Vinaya Pitaka, who mentions in a concluding poem praising the Buddha that this best-known creature, the lion, taught the three Pitakas
 haalanki, vidwaan aamtaur par buddha kii mrityu ke baad 100 se 200 saal baad teesri shatabdi isa purv ke aasapaas kuch samay paidaa karne ke liye abhimamma kaary karte hai
 Therefore, the seven Abhidhamma works are generally claimed by scholars not to represent the words of the Buddha, but to those of the disciples and scholars
 rupert gethin ne haalanki kaha ki abhimmaa paddati ke mahatvapurn tatv shaayad buddha ke jeevankaal main waapas aa jaaenge

 iske alaava, abhimmaa kaa paali sanskaran sakhti se therawada sangrah he, or anya buddha vidyalayon dwaara manyata praapt abhimamma kaaryon ke saath bahut kam he
 There is no agreement on the doctrine on the various Abhidhamma philosophies of different elementary schools and belongs to the period of 'divided Buddhism'

 Later, he became a disciple of Guru Gorakhnath and took renunciation, hence his popular name is Baba Bharathari
 inke aavirbhaav kaal ke sambandh main matbhed he
 His biography is full of variations
 raja bhartruhari ne bhi apane kavy main apane samay kaa nirdesh nahin kiya he
 Therefore, according to the stories, folklore and other material, the life-introduction of them is available as follows: paramparanusaar bhartruhari vikramsanwat ke pravartak ke agraj maane jate hai
 Vikram Samvat begins 56 years before AD, which must have been the time of Vikramaditya's maturity
 bhartruhari vikramaditya ke agraj the, at: inkaa samay kuch or purv rahaa hoga
 There are differences among scholars about the beginning of Vikramaswat

 Both these views also seem inadmissible

 His father's name was Chandrasen

 He has written century-poems on esoteric subjects like Niti, Vairagya and Shringar in beautiful and juicy language

 Some people consider Bhattikavya's author Bhatti to be his union as well
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki nathpanth ke vairaygy naamak uppanth ke ye hi pravartak the
 According to Chinese traveler Itsing, he had embraced Buddhism, but according to other sources, he was Advaita Vedantacharya
 chini yatri itsing ke yatra vivaran se yah gyaat hota he ki 651 isvi main bhartruhari naamak ek vaiyaakaran kii mrityu huyi thi
 Thus they appear to be of the seventh century but their mention in the Indian Puranas indicates that the Bhartrihari mentioned by Itsing may have been some other
 bhritahari ji kii ek katha bahut prasiddh he jo bataati he ki ve kaise sanyasi bane
 That story is given below, but in the early verses of Bhartrihari's Ethics, it is said as a sign - inke ek or rani anangsena thi jisko raja bahut pyaar karte the
 He also loved Chandrachud, the shepherd of the king's horse, and loved the commander
 us senapati kaa nagarvadhoo rupalekha ke ghar bhi aana janaa tha
 The king also used to sit in the coach with Chandrachud Kochwan at that form
 is tarah chandrachud or senapati donon kaa hi rani anangsena or rupalekha se pyaar kaa sambandh tha
 If Yogi Gorakhnathji came to know this, he sent an Amarphal with a Brahmin
 raja ne wo amarfal rani anangsena ko diya
 The queen gave it to Amarfal Chandrachud
 chandrachud jab us amarfal ko liya or jab wo raja bhartahari ko rupalekha ke yahan le gaya
 Then when the king was drunk, Chandrachud fell in love with him and gave it to Amarfal Ruplekha, saying that if she eats him, she will become immortal and her youth will live forever
 vahi fal rupalekha ne raja ko de diya kii wo usko khaaenge to amar ho jaayenge
 She hated her life
 us fal ko dekh raja krodhit ho gaye
 When asked, Ruplekha told the name of Chandrachud that he had given him immortal
 jab chandrachud ne ko raja talwaar nikaal kar sach poocha to usne rani anangsena ke saath apane sambandh kabuule or senapati kaa bhi bhed bataaya
 That day was the night of the new moon
 raja agbabula hokar nangi talwaar liye shor karata hua angasena ke awaas kii taraf bad chalaa
 Unagasena feared the king's anger and accepted the truth
 lekin usee amavasya kii raat rani ne aatmadah kar liya
 Sais Chandrachud was expelled and the general was sentenced to death
 ab raja udhaas rahete the
 Pingala sent him for hunting
 phir akhet ke samay ek sainik maaraa gaya to uski patni uski deh ke saath sati ho gai
 Raja went into deep thoughts
 ek nari thi angasena
 Ruplekha is a woman
 or ek nari he us sainik kii patni
 What is it? ab pigla vaali baat aati he jab raja kii maut kaa jhootha samachar sunate hi rani marane ko taiyaar ho jaati he
 When Gorakhnath ji resurrects the dead deer, then he is very bored with the king
 gorakhnath ji ek shart rakhte hai ki wo rani pingala ko mata kahkar mahal se bhiksha laaen to hi ve unako apana shishy banaayege
 Rani Pigla was very fond
 bhagava dhaaran karke rajmahal ke dwaar aakar raja bhritahari aawaaj lagaate he:-alakh niranjan
 Mata Pingala Bhiksham Dehi
 pingala rani kii aankhon se jal dhara bah nikalati he
 After much conversation, Rani beggars
 iske baad gorakhnath ji unako shishy banaakar apane saath le jate hai
 Some legends related to his life are as follows - ek baar raja bhartruhari apni patni pingala ke saath jangal main shikaar khilne ke liye gayi hue the
 Even after wandering there for a long time, he did not find any victim
 niraash pati-patni jab ghar laut rahe the, tabhi raste main unhen hiranon kaa ek jhund dikhaai diya
 Next to which a deer was walking
 bhartruhari ne us par prahaar karnaa chaha tabhi pingala ne unhen rokte hue anurodh kiya ki maharaj, yah mrigraaj 7 sau hiraniyon kaa pati or paalankarta he
 So do not hunt him
 bhartruhari ne patni kii baat nahin maani or hiran ko maar daalaa jisase vah maranasann hokar bhoomi par gir padaa
 While leaving his life, the deer said to King Bhartrihari - You have not done it right
 ab jo main kahata hoon uskaa paalan karo
 After my death, give my horn to Shringibaba, my eye to the playful woman, my skin to the saints, my thieves to the thieves and my body to the sinner king
 hiran kii karunamayi baaten sunakar bhartruhari kaa hriday dravit ho uthaa
 He started walking in the path after loading the deer on the horse
 raste main unki mulaakaat baba gorakhnath se hui
 Bhatrihari, making aware of this incident, requested him to bring the deer alive
 is par baba gorakhnath ne kaha- main ek shart par ise jeevandaan de saktaa hoon ki iske jivit ho jane par tumhen meraa shishy bananaa padegaa
 The king agreed to Gorakhnath
 bhartruhari ne vairaygy kyon grahan kiya yah batalaane vaali anya kinvadantiyaan bhi hai jo unhen raja tathaa vikramaditya kaa jyeshtha bhrata batalaati hai
 It is known from their texts that they were disappointed with the love they loved so much
 niti-shatak ke praarambhik shloke main bhi niraash prem kii jhalak milti he
 It is said that he had taken a quiet life after being deceived in love, which is described as follows
 is anushruti ke anusaar ek baar raja bhartruhari ke darbar main ek sadhu aayaa tathaa raja ke prati shraddha pradarshit karte hue unhen ek amar fal pradaan kiya
 The king or any person could eat this fruit and immortalize it
 raja ne is fal ko apni priy rani pingala ko khaane ke liye de diya, kintu rani ne use swayan na khaakar apane ek priy senanayake ko de diya jiskaa sambandh rajnartiki se tha
 He too did not eat the fruit himself and gave it to the diplomat
 is prakaar yah amar fal rajnartiki ke paas pahunch gaya
 Finding the fruit, the diplomat thought of giving it to the king
 vah rajdurbar main pahaunchi tathaa raja ko fal arpit kar diya
 The king was surprised to find the fruit given to Rani Pingala from politics and asked it to reach him
 rajnartiki ne sankshep main raja ko sab kuch batala diya
 This incident had a very deep impact on the king and he decided to retire after knowing the impermanence of the world and went on to do penance in the forest, making his younger brother Vikram the heir to the kingdom
 inke teenon hi shatak utkrishtatam sanskrit kavy hai
 Many of his verses are inspired by personal experience and the element of self-reflection is fully reflected in him
 bhavishya puraana se gyaat hota he ki raja vikramaditya kaa samay atyant sukh or samruddhi kaa tha
 At that time there was a Brahmin named Jayant in his kingdom
 ghor tapasya ke parinaam swaroop use indra ke yahan se ek fal kii prapti hui thi jisaki visheshta yah thi ki koi bhi vyakti use kha lene ke uparant amar ho saktaa tha
 Having received the fruit, the Brahmin came to his house and decided to give it to King Bhartrihari and gave it to him

 He ruled justly in Ujjayini, the capital of Malwa
 unki ek rani thi jiskaa naam pingala bataaya jaataa he
 The king loved her very much, while she used to treat the Maharaja very treacherously
 yadhyapi inke chote bhai vikramaditya ne raja bhartruhari ko anek baar sachesht kiya tha tathaapi raja ne uske prem jaal main phase hone ke kaaran uske kriya-kalapon par dhyaan nahin diya tha
 Based on that recommendation, it is indicated that Bhartrihari was a resident of Malwa and the elder brother of Vikramaditya

 Dividend policy refers to the decision of operators by which they decide how much of profit should be distributed as dividend and how much is retained
 ek vyavsaayik sanstha kaa uddeshy laabh kamanaa he
 This in itself is an important financial decision as to how to use the profits earned
 mukhya prashn yah uthta he ki laabh kaa purna upbhog swaamiyon dwaara kiya jaae yaa use vyavsaay main hi pratidhaarit karke punarviniyog kiya jaye
 In the case of a single trader, there is no problem in making this type of decision
 isi prakaar saajhedaari sanstha kii dasha main saajhedaari sanlekh main spasht rup se ullekh kiya gaya he ki laabh ko saajhedaari / swaamiyon main kis prakaar vitarit kiya jayega
 Yes, in the case of the organization of the company, this decision seems a bit complicated
 company adhinium me spasht ullekh kiya gaya he ki ek company ko apane laabh kaa kitna pratishat anshadhariyon ke bich main vitarit karnaa evam kitne pratishat pratidhaarit karnaa he jisase company apni bhavishya kii yojana nirdhaarit kar sake
 The company is an 'artificial person' and business stakeholders are more dispersed
 laabh ke prayog sambandhi nirnay kaa bhaar kuch vyaktiyon ke samooh par hi hota he jinhen sanchaalak mandal kehete hai
 Like other organization formats, the problem of sharing the net profit of the company is either to retain the profits in the business itself or to divide the shareholders as dividends
 anshadhariyon main vibhajya laabh ke vitaran sambandhi nirnay mahatvapurn hota he
 Decisions taken in this regard may not mean high income, low income or some income to the shareholders
 vidyaman anshadhariyon ke ruukh ko prabhavit karne ke saath-saath labhaansh dene ke nirnay kaa prabhaav bhavi anshadhariyon, skandh vinimay va vittiya sansthaaon ke ruukh va vyavhaar par bhi pad saktaa he, kyonki labhaansh kaa sambandh company ke mulya se hota he jo company ke anshon ke bazaar mulya ko prabhavit karata he

 jahaan koi paksh niyamit aay ke paksh main hota he, to koi puunji vruddhi yaa puunjigat laabh main ruchi rakhata he is prakaar labhaansh niti kaa nirmaan karnaa ek jatil nirnay he
 Many things have to be carefully considered, but it is certain that instead of taking any ad hoc step, a proper long-term policy regarding dividends should be followed
 vittiya prabandh kaa mukhya uddeshy sanstha ke bazaar mulya kaa adhikeekaran hota he
 The market value of the equity of the entity is affected by the policy on how net profit or excess is allocated between dividend payment and reappropriation
 prabandhakon ke saamne yah vikalp nahin hota he ki labhaansh baante yaa na baante
 Yes, the question is, how much dividend should be distributed? The answer lies in the dividend policy
 labhaansh niti kaa arth labhaansh vitarit karne ke siddhanton va yojana se hota he
 Weston and Brygum wrote, anshadhariyon main labhaansh ke rup main arjan ke vitaran ke sambandh main prabandh dwaara nirmit niti ko hi labhaansh niti kehete hai
 It is not only related to the dividend payable in a particular session, but also with the steps to be followed for many years
 labhaansh niti nirmaan karne se purv nimnlikhit prashnon ke uttar dhundne honge - The portion of the profit, called the divisible profit that the members of the company receive, is called dividend
 vibhajya laabh se aashay company ke un laabhon se he jo vaidhanik taur par company ke anshadhariyon ke bich baante ja sakate hai
 As per the Companies Act, 1974 amended 1975, dividend profit means 1 / 3 part of the net profit of the company or 12 percent of the dividend payable on the face value of the shares of the company and the amount of dividend payable on the foregoing shares
 is aashay ke liye shuddh laabh vah laabh hota he, jo company adhinium, 1956 kii dhara 394 ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar ho or usamen se iskar kii raashi gata di gayi ho tathaa company adhinium kii dhara 205 ke anusaar hraas gata diya gaya ho
 Dividends are a part of surplus remaining after deducting all expenses from the total income earned and making provisions for special types of funds and taxes
 is aadhiky par sam anshadhariyon kaa hi adhikaar hota he
 Yes, in the case of priority shares, they get priority over this share over even shareholders
 yadhyapi sam anshadhariyon kaa is aadhiky par puraa adhikaar hota he phir bhi kanoonee taur par anshadhari iske purna vitaran ke liye yaa tatkaal vitaran ke liye company ko baadhya nahin kar sakate hai
 The following are the elements that determine the dividend policy: - labhaansh kaa vitaran company ke vartmaan va gat varsh ke laabhon main se hi kiya ja saktaa he isliye labhaansh niti ko prabhavit karne vaala sabase pramukh tatv company kaa laabh hota he
 The profit of the company helps in setting the dividend ceiling
 isi prakaar sthaayee rup se laabh arjeet karne vaali companiyaan un companiyon kii apeksha jinke laabh main ucchavachan hota rahata he laabh kaa adhik bhaag labhaansh ke rup main vitarit karti hai
 If the company has sufficient cash available at the time of declaration of dividend, then payment of cash dividend will be appropriate

 If the sudden dividend rate is increased completely compared to the previous year, then the speculative trend will develop in the market
 yathasambhav labhaansh dar sthir rakhane kaa prayaas company prabandh dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, while declaring dividends, operators should base the dividend rates of previous years
 anshadhari jab ansh kray karte hai to ve labhaansh ke bare main kuch apekshaayen bana lete hai, unka aadar sanchaalkon ko karnaa chahie
 From a statutory point of view, the operators are free to use the company's income for various purposes, but they cannot forget the views and hopes of the shareholders, or else there may be a huge difficulty in raising additional capital in future
 puraani companiyaan udaar labhaansh niti apana sakati hai jabaki nav sthapit companiyon ko apni aay kaa adhikansh bhaag vikaas kaaryon main lagaana aavashyak hota he
 Hence they retain the remaining income by paying dividend to the shareholders at a lower rate
 ucchavachanon arthath teji-mandi ke saath-saath labhaansh niti bhi parivartit ho jaati he
 At the time of recession, the amount of profit decreases, hence the company is forced to reduce the dividend rate
 agar company ne labhaansh samanikaran kosh paryaapt maatra main rakhaa ho to yen-ken prakaren labhaansh kii uchit dar banaae rakhane main safal ho jaati hai
 During the boom time, there is a competition to increase the dividend rate in the corporate world due to increase in profit
 sarkaar kii nitiyon main samay samay par parivartan hote rahete hai jisase company ke laabhon main kami va vruddhi hona avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 The industrial labor and tariff policies of the government have an impact on dividend policy
 udhaaharan ke liye udaarikaran ke vartmaan daur main company kshetra ke niyantran va shulkon main kami ho rahi he
 As a result, there is a positive impact on profits and dividends
 kabhi-kabhi sarkaar puunji nirmaan kii gati teevr karne ke uddeshy se laabhon ko adhikansh bhaag ko punarviniojit karne vaali companiyon ko aay kar main suvidhaayen detii he
 Similarly, re-appropriation of benefits is encouraged by levying additional tax on entities that distribute more dividends
 isliye labhaansh niti par kar niti kaa prabhaav padataa he
 In any democratic country public opinion and public reactions have a wide impact on dividend policy
 adhik labhaansh dene vaali companiyaan kii janata dwaara aalochana kii jaati he
