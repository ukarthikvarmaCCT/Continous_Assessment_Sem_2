 pakistan kii sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan kanoonee or sanvaidhanik maamalon main faisla karne vaali antim madhyasth bhi he
 The permanent office of the Supreme Court is located in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, while many sub-branches of this court are functioning in important cities of Pakistan where cases are heard
 sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan ko kai sanvaidhanik va nyaayik vikalp praapt hote hai, jinaki vyakhya pakistan ke samvidhan main kii gai he
 The Supreme Court has established itself even during the tenure of several military governments and unconstitutional dictatorial governments in the country
 saath hi, is adaalat ne sainya shakti par ek vaastavik nireekshak ke rup main swayan ko sthapit kiya he or kai avasaron main sarkaron kii nigaraanee kii he
 This court has appellate authority over all high courts and federal courts
 iske alaava yah kuch prakaar ke maamalon par mul adhikaar bhi rakhata he
 The Supreme Court is made up of a Chief Justice and a set number of senior judges, who are nominated by the President after consulting the Prime Minister
 ek baar niyukt nyaayadhish ko, ek nirdisht avadhi ko puraa karne or uske baad hi ritair hone kii ummid kii jaati he, jab tak ki ve duraachaar ke kaaran sarvocch nyaayik parishad dwaara nilambit nahin kiye jate hai
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan was established by the 1956 Constitution
 isane 1948 main, aadesh dwaara sthapit, sangheey adaalat kaa navaroop tha
 Since its formation in 1956, it has retained its judicial authority and has been successful in asserting its authority even during the tenure of several Saini governments
 1956 ke samvidhan ke anusaar: ucchtam nyaayalay karanchi main sthapit thi, parantu 1949 main ise lahore main punarsthapit kar diya gaya, jahaan yah maujuuda lahore ucch nyaayalay ke bhawan main kaaryshil tha
 In the 1973 Constitution document, the Supreme Court has been set up in Islamabad and it is hoped that the Supreme Court should be established in the capital of the country
 parantu raashi ke abhaav ke kaaran nyaayalay ke bhawan ko us samay islamabad main nahin nirmit kiya ja sakaa tha
 So in 1974 the court was moved from Lahore to Rawalpindi
 1989 main, sarkaar dwaara islamabad main sarvocch nyaayalay ke nae bhawan ke nirmaan ke liye dhanrashi aavantit kii gai
 The construction of the existing building on the Constituency Avenue of Islamabad started only in 1990, but due to the lack of money, only the main building could be constructed by 1993, so further construction was stopped in 1993
 31 disambar 1993 main nayaayalay ko rawalpindi se islamabad main nirmit bhawan main punarsthapit kiya gaya evam parisar ke anya bhawanon ke nirmaan ko 2011 tak puraa kiya gaya
 The options, layout, rules and duties of the court Pakistan have been identified in Article 176 Ta 191 in Part 7, Chapter II of the Constitution of Pakistan
 unke lekh kaa sarsari samiksha aabhal main kaha gaya he: In addition to the observations described above, the constitution has been ordered to contact the court in legal, constitutional and domestic matters in Ja Baja second chapter and sections in Pakistan
 pakistan ke nyaayik vyavastha main sarvocch nyaayalay kaa yah bhoomika spasht he ki vah pakistan ke anya bhaagon main na keval sanvaidhanik or kanoonee najar rakhe balki unke sarkari shakhaon main vikalp or kartavyon kii sahi pahchaan or vitaran bhi amal main laae
 Sections 176 to 190 of the Constitution give several constitutional powers to the Supreme Court, the use of which can control and hinder the President's work independence
 udhaahranswaroop: samvidhan ke anusaar raashtrapati ke paas qaumi asembli ko bhang karne kaa adhikaar he, parantu aise kisi bhi vivaadasper bhangan ko vaiddh yaa avaiddh qaraar dene kaa adhikaar sarvocch nyaayalay ko diya gaya he
 Apart from this, the court has also been empowered to inspect any decision and order taken by the President and declare it as non-constitutional and illegal
 haalaanki ye praavdhaan samvidhan dwaara ankit kiye gaye hai, parantu inhen aamtaur par upyog nahin kiya jaataa he
 But if seen in the context of constitutional history of Pakistan, then such rights have been used on many occasions
 kai vivaadaaspad nirnyon ke baavjood is nyaayalay kaa pakistani raajnneeti main ahm sthaan he, atah anek sainya sarkaron va rajnatik anban ke dauron ke baad bhi is nyaayalay ne apana sthaan banaae rakhaa he, evam kai baar sena ke avaidh takaton par lagaam daalati rahi he, or yah pakistan ke kuch sabase sammanneey sansthaanon main se ek he or aam janata main ise vishwaas kii drushti se dekha jaataa he
 Politics gateway sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan kii nyaaypalika kaa shikaar bindu he, evam pakistani nyaayik tantra kaa shreshthatam va ucchtam nyaayalay he
 Pakistan has a hierarchical system of judiciary in which there are two classes of courts: shreshthatar nyaaypalika main, ucchtam nyaayalay ke atirikt, sangheey sharia adaalat or paanch prantiy ucch nyaayalayon aate hai, jiske sheersh par supreme court virajman he
 At the lower level of the Supreme Court, there is a High Court constituted for each of the four provinces and the capital city of Islamabad
 pakistan kaa samvidhan, nyaaypalika par samvidhan kii raksha, sangrakshan va bachaav kaa daayitv saunpta he
 Neither the Supreme Court nor the High Court can exercise jurisdiction in respect of tribal areas, unless otherwise provided
 aaazaad kashmir or gilgit-baltistan ke vivaadit kshetron ke liye alag nyaayik pranali he
 The subordinate judiciary consists of courts which come under superior system
 isamen, civil or aapraadhik janapadiya nyaayalay va anya anek vishesh adaalatein shaamil hai, jo, banking, beemaa, seemaa shulk va utpaada shulk, taskari, drugs, aatankwaad, karadhaan, paryaavaran, upabhokta sangrakshan, or bhrashtachar sambandhit maamalon main adhikarita kaa prayog karti hai
 Criminal courts were created under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and civil courts were established by the West Pakistan Civil Courts Ordinance, 1964
 saath hi, rajasav adaalatein bhi hai, jo ki pashchimi pakistan bhu-rajasav adhinium, 1967 ke tahat kaam kar rahe hai
 The decisions taken by all these courts are appeal-bound
 arthath nirnay ko unchi adaalaton main chunauti di ja sakati he
 The supreme court has final jurisdiction in this
 pakistan ke mukhya nyaayadhish, pakistan kii nyaaypalika ke pramukh evam ucchtam nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish hote hai
 He is the senior-most among the 16 judges of the Supreme Court
 mukhya nyaayadhish pakistan kii nyaayik pranali ke pramukh prashasnic adhikari he evam yah pakistan kaa ucchtam nyaayalay pad he jo sangheey nyaaypalika kii niti nirdhaaran vah ucchtam nyaayalay main nyaayik kaaryon kaa karyanvayan ke liye jimmedaar he
 The nomination for appointment to this post is done by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and finally the President of Pakistan
 adaalat kii sunwaayee par adhyakshata karte hue mukhya nyaayadhish ke paas nyaayalay kii niti nirdhaaran ke liye atyant takat he
 At the same time, according to modern tradition, the Chief Justice of Pakistan was the first Chief Justice Sir Abdul Rashid
 maujuuda sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ke anusaar sarvocch nyaayalay main mukhya nyaayadhish ke atirikt, adhiktam 16 or nyaayadhish rah sakate hai
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan consists of a Chief and 16 other appointed judges
 nyaayadhish ke rup main anubhav ke 5 saal tak yaa vakil ke rup main 15 varshon ke anubhav waal kisi vyakti ko hi sarvocch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish ke pad ke liye aavedan karne kaa adhikaar he
 The President of Pakistan appoints judges of the court from the recommendation made by the Supreme Court to individuals based on their discretion and experience in various fields of law
 supreme court kii siforishein ko raashtrapati par badhyakaari he
 Exercise: As a rule, the most senior judge of the Supreme Court is appointed as the Chief Justice
 prayek nyaayadhish 65 saal kii umr tak pad dhaaran kar sakate hai, jis bich ve jaldi hi istipha dwaara yaa samvidhan ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 That is, due to physical or mental incapacity or misconduct - the validity of which is determined by the Supreme Judicial Council - any judge can be removed only on the basis of the provisions provided by the Constitution before the term is completed

 The Second Sex is a book written in French by Simon the Bauer that has deeply influenced feminine perceptions and discourse
 stri adhikaaravaadi vichaardhaara vaali simon kii yah pustak nari astitvvaad ko prabhavi tareeke se prastut karti he
 It establishes that the woman does not take birth but is created as she grows in life
 unki yah vyakhya higel ke soch ko dhyaan main rakhkar “doosraa” kii sankalpana pradaan karti he
 According to her concept, a woman should have the right to live and work in her life according to her likes and dislikes and she can move from man to society
 aisa karke wo sthirataa se aage badhkar shreshthata kii ore apana jivan aage badha saktin hai
 By doing this, women are encouraged to move from the cycle of duty in their lives to move towards independent life
 doosraa ling ek iesai pustak he, jo europe ke saamaajik, rajnatik, va dharmik niyamo ko chunauti detii hai, jisane nari astitv evam nari pragati main hameshaa se baadha daali he or nari jaati ko purusho se neeche sthaan diya hai
 In this book, he has given his thoughts about the policy of not thinking on the goodness of the women who have been harassed by the frauds of the men
 iskaa hindi anuwaad stri upekshita naam se hua
 The Second Sex was originally written under the title Le Temps Modernes, which was published in June 1949
 is kitaab kaa doosraa bhaag pehle bhaag ke chhapane ke kuch mahino baad prakashit kii gayi thi
 Both parts were published in the US soon after by Howard Persley, translated into English
 howard par anuwaad karne kaa prastaav alfred nof kii patni, blaanch nof na rakhaa tha
 Since Howard understood very little of French and he had no interest in or understanding of philosophy, he had done the work of translation to a great extent
 ve smith college main jeev vigyaan padhaate the
 Many years later, in 2009, on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the original published French book, a second translated book of the two parts was published
 beovior ne apni vichaardhaara do alag auraton se pratyaashit kii thi, erika jong or german greer, jo striyon ke ahikaro par samarthan karti thim
 "woman: Myth or Truth" is a chapter where the writer Beauvoir describes how men have given woman the status of "second" in society
 ve kahati hai ki purush ne nari ke chaaro ore jhuthe niyam ore kaanoon banaakar unhen is aashwashan main rakhaa hai ki unki jagah purush shreshth hai
 The writer believed that by doing this, the men had lost their understanding of the problems of the women and their false frauds have helped them to keep the women bound under them in the society
 beovoir kaa maananaa hai ki aisa hi dabaav samaj ke dusre bhaago main bhi dekha gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye, samaaj main rang, jaati, evam dharman ko lekar kattar va choti soch vaale paakhandee logon ne kai jhagade va bhed-bhav felaaya he
 But they believe that as much as Sastri caste has been suppressed in the history of society, no religion and caste has been suppressed
 nari ko apane se neeche rakhkar paakhandee purushon na samaaj main apana ooncha sthaan banaaye rakhaa hai
 In his book Beauvoir has highlighted many such ideas, which challenge the rules or rules of society
 unhone kaha hai ki striyon ko kamazor evam shaareerik va maansik rup se asaamaanya mana gaya he or isi karanvash striyon ko kahi bhi uchit avasar nahin mila hai
 Women have always been assured that they are weak and they should follow the guidance of men to remain stable and normal
 da second sex ke prakashit hone se pehle nari astitvvaad ke vishay main france main kabhi koi bhi vichaar vimarsh nahin hue the or striyon ko kabhi bhi samaaj ke kanoonon se koi shikaayat nahin thim
 But Boar changed the mind
 unka nari va purusjh jaati kii samaaj main samanta do muddon kii taraf dhyaan khinchataa hai: ek, ki kis tarah shaareerik asaamanyata purushon ko nari se upar va badhkar hone kaa kaaran ban gayi hai
 The second is how debating and thinking about physical abnormalities shows that physical abnormality is actually an action of nature and men have no hand in it
 atah, shaareerik asaamanyata ko purusho ore nari main saamaajik asamaanyata karne kaa kaaran vyarth evam murkh hai
 Here Beauvoir denies Plato's idea that a person's gender is an event that does not insist on that person
 isliye, purusho or naario main koi bhed bhav nahin karnaa chahie
 Beauvoir has made many contributions to women's existence, but Beauvoir has never called herself a staunch feminist rightist
 parantu 1960 or 1970 ke stri adhikaaravaadi morcho ke baad 1972 main beovoir na apane aap ko ek stri adhikaaravaadi ghoshit kiya tha

 thalaisa saura mandal ke aathve grah varun kaa ek upgrah he

 The color of this satellite appears to be thick

 During that time, the old satellites revolving around Varun had a lot of conflicts due to the changing effect of gravity which caused the satellite to collapse and leave its debris and Thalassa is the result of that
 triton ko chhodkar, varun ke anya upgrahon kaa nirmaan kuch aise hi hua tha
 Like some of the other inner moons of Varuna, Thalassa is slowly coming close to Varuna and scientists think that at some point it will either collapse and collapse in Varuna's atmosphere or Varun's inner boundary is coming
 Breaking by its gravity would create debris for a satellite ring
 thalaisa ko angrezi main "thalassa" kehete hai

 The method of obtaining representative models from a large population or a group is called sampling
 pratichayan ki paddati, vishleshan ke prakaar par nirbhar karti he
 The total number of units of the representative model is called the sample population
 pratidarsh puri aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv hona chahie
 When a sample is chosen from a large population, it is necessary to consider how this election is being made
 ek pratinidhi pratidarsh praapt karne ke liye, pratidarsh betaratib dhang se chunaa janaa chahie
 For example, to determine the average age of a university's students, 10% of the students can be sampled using a lottery system
 isse chaatro ki abaadi kaa ek bhalee-bhanti pratinidhitiv milegaa or chaatro kii ausat umr kaa anumaanit aankada praapt hoga
 Purposive sampling soddeshy pratichayan main pratidarsh kaa chunaav ek nishchit uddeshy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya jaataa he
 For example, if we want to give a picture of the standard of living of the people living in the city of New Delhi, then we will include only the people living in the grand and luxurious neighborhoods, and will ignore the low income and middle class neighborhoods
 
 is pratichayan paddati ki kami yah he ki ye pakshpaati he or isse puri aabaadi kaa pratinidhi pratidarsh praapt nahin hota he
 Simple random sampling saral yadrichhik pratichayan ke kuch mahatvapurn tathy : There are several ways to obtain simple random models

 stratified sampling stareekrut pratichayan main, kuch lakshanon ke aadhaar par jansankhya ko samoohon main baanta jaataa he
 Then, within each group, a probability model is selected
 stareekrut pratichayan main, samoohon ko tabake kaha jaataa he
 As an example, suppose we conduct a national survey
 ham aabaadi ko, bhugol ke aadhaar par samoohon main vibhajit karte he - uttar, purv, dakshin or pashchim
 Then, within each group, we can select the sample at random
 vyavasthit yadrichhik pratichayan In systematic random sampling, we make a list of every member of the population
 suchi se, ham yadrichhik dhang se aabaadi suchi ke pehle k ikaayiyon kaa chayan karte hai
 Next, we select each element from the list
 prayek k tatwon vaale pratidarsh kaa chayan baraabar nahin hota he, isi kaaran vyavasthit yadrichhik pratichayan yadrichhik pratichayan se alag he
 Good data collection has the following characteristics: pratichayan, puri aabaadi main se sahi pratidarsh samshti kaa chayan karne main shodhakarta ko sakasham banaata he
 For example, 600 million tweets are produced per day
 par kya ye aavashyak he ki puure din ke charchit vishay ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye un saare twit ko padhaa jaye? yaa kya ye aavashyak he ki kisi ek vishay par ek saamaanya vichaar prakat karne ke liye saare mantavya par dhyaan diya jaye? ek saamaanya vichaar ki bhavishyavaanee karne ke liye yah sabhi data ko dekhne ki aavashyaktaa nahin he, iske liye keval ek pratidarsh paryaapt ho saktaa he
 a theoretical formulation for modeling Twitter data has been developed
 pratichayan siddhant kaa avishkaar achaanak hi nahin kiya gaya, balkee iskaa satatya rup main anya sankhyikeey tareekon ke saath vikaas kiya gaya he
 In modern times sampling theory has become a separate, grown-up branch of statistical science, but it was not so in the early stages
 pratichayan surveykshan kii jaden, sambhavyata siddhant or prayogtmak dizin kii tulana main, sarkari avan saamaajik sankhyikee main adhik nihit he
 Political mathematics in the early stages, and later social calculus, were important activities that eventually led to the emergence of modern sampling theory
 haalanki, sambhavyata siddhant pratichayan siddhant kaa ek antarnihit ghatak banane ke pashchaat hi pratichayan siddhant ko sankhyikeey vigyaan kaa ek vaastavik shakha mana gaya he
 The history of sampling surveys has a long history

 Refrigerator is a home-use device that keeps vegetables and food items cold and keeps them from getting spoiled quickly

 Initially, only gas powered devices were made, but now some years electric powered refrigerators have become popular
 aajkal sab prakaar ke prashithitron kii almariyaan dekhne main ek si hi lagati hai
 They are coated with a layer of porcelain and a thick effluent coating on the outside
 bhinn bhinn maadlon kii keemat ke anusaar prashithitr kii deevaaron main laga ooshmaarodhak 2 se 4 inch tak motaa hota he
 The thicker the insulator, the more effective it will be, because the heat of most of the atmosphere is passed through the walls into the food
 prayek prashithitr main rakhe khadyapadartho ko thanda rakhane kaa kaam kisi prasheetak madhyam kii bhautik dasha main parivartan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, a good refrigerant must have the following qualities: ammonia gas, sulfur doiaksaide, carbon dioxide, dychlor-dyphlor-mithen pramukh gaisen hai, jinka upyog prashithan main hota he
 The principle of refrigerators operated only by ice and by the device is virtually the same, because in both of them the heat of the food is only absorbed by the physical change of the medium
 pehle main to barf pighalkar pani ban jaataa he, or duusare main prasheetak drav, yantra ke dwaara gas se parinat ho jaataa he
 Multifunctional refrigerators are made in such a way that air is transported from the underside of the ice blocks and the ice is at fault
 at: jab tak khaadya kaksh band rahata he uskaa taap 60 se 80 ke bich rahata he, chaahe barf kii silli kitni hi patali ho jaae
 Thus a sill lasts for 4-5 days
there are two types of svachlit prakaar ke yantric prashithitr do prakaar ke hote hai, ek to sampeden ke siddhant par ore duusare avasorana ke siddhant par chalanevaale

 Mathematically, the above statement can be expressed by the following differential equation, where n is a quantity and λ is a positive number called the decay constant: uparokt sameekaran kaa hal nimna he:charghaatanki parivartan kii dar Here n is the quantity at time t and N0 = n is its initial value at t = 0
 yadi samay t par nikaay main kshayit tatv kii maatra n kisi nishchit samucchy main vivikt tatwon kii sankhya he, tab us samay kaa madhya maan kalit karnaa sambhav he jisamen tatv samucchy main rahata he
 This time is called the mean age, it is denoted by τ and it can be shown that it is related to the decay rate λ, as follows: madhya aayu ko "ekak samay" ke rup main bhi dekha jaataa he, kyonki ham charghaatanki kshay dar sameekaran ko kshay niyatank λ ke sthaan par madhya aayu, τ dwaara bhi likhaa ja saktaa he: Here we can see that τ is the time when the total amount of the amount decreases to 1 / e = 0

 The half age is the period of an element decaying; In which that element becomes half of the original quantity
 ise us tatva kii ardh-aayu kaha jaataa he or pratik t1 / 2 se nirupit kiya jaataa he
 Half-age can be written as expressions of mean age or decay constant: sameekaran ko 2 ke aadhaar main likhane par: Hence, 2−1 = 1 / 2 quantity of the substance remains
 atah madhya aayu τ { \ displaystyle \ tau }, ardh-aayu ko 2 ke praakrit laghuganak se bhajit karne par praapt hoti he, arthath: For example, Polonium-210 has a half-life of 138 days and a mean age of 200 days
 jo sameekaran charghaatanki kshay ko nirupit karti he nimna prakaar likhi jaati he Or, upon reconfiguration, samaklit karne par Where c is the integral constant, so jahaan antim pratisthaapan, N0 = ec, ko sameekaran main t = 0 dwaara praapt kiya gaya he, N0, t = 0 par padaarth kii maatra he

 According to the legend mentioned in the Mahabharata, Eklavya came to Dronacharya's ashram for the purpose of learning archery, but being a Nishadputra, Dronacharya did not accept him as his disciple
 niraash ho kar eklavya van main chalaa gaya
 He made an idol of Dronacharya and started practicing archery by considering that idol as Guru
 ekagrachitt se sadhana karte huye alpakaal main hi vah dhanurvidya main atyant nipun ho gaya
 One day the Pandava and Kaurava princes along with Guru Drona went for hunting to the same forest where Eklavya was practicing archery by building an ashram
 rajkumaron kaa kutta bhatak kar eklavya ke ashram main ja pahunchaa
 He started screaming on seeing Eklavya

 kute ke lautne par kaurav, pandav tathaa swayan dronacharya yah dhanurkaushal dekhakar dang rah gaye or baan chalaane vaale kii khoj karte hue eklavya ke paas pahunche
 He was even more surprised to know that Ekalavya, having considered Dronacharya as Manas Guru, has attained this learning by practice himself
 katha ke anusaar eklavya ne gurudakshina ke rup main apana angutha katkar dronacharya ko de diya tha
 a symbolic meaning of this could also be that Dronacharya, considering Eklavya to be super-talented, donated him the special method of bow without a thumb
 kehete hai ki angootha cat jane ke baad eklavya ne tarjani or madhyamaa anguli kaa prayog kar tir chalaane laga
 This is where the modern method of archery was born

 brajabhasha mulat: braj kshetra kii boli he
 | From whose west it can be found in the sub-languages of Rajasthani
 haryana main yah dilli ke dakshini ilaakon main boli jaati he- faridabad jila or gudgaanv or mevaat jilon ke purvi bhaag
 It developed mainly in western Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 mathura, bharatpur,hindun city, dhaulpur, agra, gwalior aadi ilaakon main aaj bhi yah mukhya samvaad kii bhashaa he
 The Brajbhasha exists either in its original form or with slight changes in this one area
 isiliye is ilaake ke ek bade bhaag ko brijanchal yaa brijbhoomi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The "brajbhasha" developed in the tradition of Indian Aryan languages is born from the womb of Shaurseni Apabhramsa
 jab se gokul vallabh sampradaay kaa centre bana, brajabhasha main krishna vishyak sahitya likhaa jane laga
 With this effect, the dialect of Braj became a literary language
 bhaktikaal ke prasiddh mahakavi mahatma surdaas se lekar aadhunik kaal ke vikhyath kavi shri viyogi hari tak brajabhasha main prabandh kavy tathaa muktak kavy samay samay par rache jate rahe
 Due to the influence of district life, many forms of Braj Bhasha are visible to us
 kintu thode se antar ke saath unamem ekarupata kii spasht jhalak hamen dekhne ko milti he
 Brajbhasha has its own metaphorical nature, that is, its singular masculine nouns and adjectives are often immediate; Nouns such as Khurpou, Yamrau, Manjou, etc
 are out of date
 isi prakaar karau, goru, saanwarau aadi visheshan pad aukarant he
 The common past-present singular masculine form of the verb also remains predominantly in Brajbhasha
 yah baat alag he ki uske kuch kshetron main "y" shruti kaa aagam bhi paaya jaataa he
 In the dialect of Tehsil Kol of District Aligarh, the common past tense form is devoid of "Y" Shruti, but "Y" Shruti is definitely found in the Tehsils of District Mathura and South Bulandshahr
 jaise : "" Carau Chora Bolou "" -
 ""karau chhora bolgau"" -
 "" Carau Landa Bolou "" -
 kannauji kii apni prakruti okarant he
 In the forms of nouns, adjectives and verbs, Kannauji follows Okranta where Brajbhasha moves with inertia
 jila aligarh kii jalapadiya brajabhasha main yadi ham kahen ki- ""karau chhora bolau"" to ise hi kannauji main kahenge ki-""kaaro larika bolo
 The future verb kannauji has a tintarupini, but in the Brajbhasha, it is found to be kridantarupini
 yadi ham "ladkaa jayega" or "ladki jaaegi" vaakyon ko kannauji tathaa brajabhasha main roopantarit karke bolen to nimnaankit rup pradaan karenge : In Kannauji - Lurika Jai hai
 bitiyaa jaihai
 In Brajbhasha - Chhora Jaigou
 chhori jaigi
 It is clear from the above examples that the verb in the common future tense form of Brajbhasha changes according to the gender of the subject, while there is a form in Kannauji
 iske atirikt kannauji main avadhi kii bhanti vivruti kii pravriti bhi pai jaati he jiskaa brajabhasha main abhaav he
 Sandhyrithya is often found in the nouns, pronouns, etc
 of Kannauji, but in Brajbhasha, those terms are found in the rheumatic state
 udhaaharan : Kannauji - "" Bu Go ""
 brajabhasha -""bo gayu"" 
 In the pronouns "bo" and "bo", the pronouns of the above sentences describe the nature of the two languages of Sandhirahitya and Sandhi
 brajabhasha kshetra kii bhashaagat vibhinnata ko drushti main rakhte hue ham uskaa vibhaajan nimnaankit rup main kar sakate hai : The central Braj ie Adarsh braj Bhasha - The Braj Bhasha of Aligarh, Mathura and Western Agra can be named "adarsh braj Bhasha"
 budeli prabhavit brajabhasha - gwalior ke uttar pashchim main boli janevaali bhashaa ko yah naam pradaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Brajbhasha influenced by Jaipuri of Rajasthan - It is spoken in Bharatpur and its southern part
 sikarwari brajabhasha - brajabhasha kaa yah rup gwalior ke uttar purv ke anchal main prachlit he jahaan sikarwaad rajputon kii bastiyaan pai jaati hai
 Jadobati Brajbhasha - Brajbhasha, spoken in the region of Karauli and in the plains of the Chambal River, is called "jadoubari"
 yahan jaadu rajputon kii bastiyaan hai
 Kannauji-influenced Braj Bhasha - District Etah and Tehsils are influenced by Kannauji language of Anupshahar and Atrauli
 brajbhaashi kshetra kii janapadiya brajabhasha kaa rup pashchim se purv kii ore kaisaa hota chalaa gaya he, iske liye nimnaankit udhaaharan drashtavy hai : In the district Gurgaon - "" Tamaso lost sight
 aaps main jhagro ho rahyu ho
 Then the song stopped

 In practice, localizing a gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily provide the ability to isolate or enrich a specific relevant genomic sequence
 To augment any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be connected to the origin of the replica, which is a DNA sequence capable of directing the transmission of itself and any sequence associated with it

 The success rate per fertilized egg was low in the modeling of dolly sheep; He was born after the use of 237 eggs to develop 29 embryos, which gave birth to only three lambs and only one of them survived
 Seventy calves have been produced by 9,000 attempts and one third of them died at an early age; Had to try 328 times for the promotion
 Notably, although the earliest replicated organisms were frogs, no frogs have yet been generated from somatic adult nucleus donor cells

 vaisya bhi 'dwij' kahe gaye hai
