 richter paimaana bukamp kii tarangon kii tivrata maapne kaa ek ganitiya paimaana he
 The simple logarithm of the ratio between the maximum amplitude of the ground and the random small amplitude at the time of an earthquake is called the 'richter scale'
 richter paimaane kaa vikaas 1930 ke dashak main kiya gaya tha
 From 1970 onwards, 'moment magnitude') was used in place of the Richter scale for the measurement of earthquake intensity
 'riktar paimaane' kaa puraa naam richter pariman pareekshan paimaana he or laghu rup main ise sthanik pariman likhte hai
 This scale is represented by a number to measure the amount of geological energy emitted from an earthquake

 To sign the current deal with coca-cola, coca-cola helped pay for all the existing restaurants in North America to run the initial toaster oven
 Subway gave customers the option to toast their sandwiches in response to increased competition with the quiznos, the anti-sandwich chain that popularized toasted submarine sandwiches
 In Australia, the introduction of fresh toasting enabled the Subway franchise to prevent Quiznos from gaining market share

 For many years, Subway Restaurant offered a customer rewards program called "sub Clubbers"
 Customers were given a special ticket when they bought the sandwich, one ticket on a six-inch sandwich and two on the foot-long; Customers were also given small cards called "sub club cards" which had to be stamped and stored in an orderly manner

 In early June 2005, Subway announced that the popular Customer Rewards program would be phased out due to forgery

 usamen daawa kiya gaya ki 1990 ke dashak main, subway apane frenchiziyon ke saath kai kanoonee vivaadon main fansaa tha, jo aam taur par atikaraman se sambandhit the 
 The book blamed the "development agents" who handled the company's development regionally
 They retain some percentage of their franchise fee for their local area and therefore it is in their interest to fill the market with subway restaurants in the area, regardless of its impact on regional subway locations
 While this may lead to lower profits per each subway location, it can achieve higher profits for the overall sector and therefore more profit for the entire chain and development agent

 DAI and SFAFT are engaged in legal battles with each other over claims by SFAFT of excessive administrative and employee costs and unilateral decision making, which ultimately will not be beneficial to existing franchises, by DAI

 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times

 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization

 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer

 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world

 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort

 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2

 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose

 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India

 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live

 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha

 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them

 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year

 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance

 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
