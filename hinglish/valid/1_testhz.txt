 chandragupta vikramaditya gupt rajvansh kaa raja
 Chandragupta the second great who is known as Vikramaditya or Chandragupta Vikramaditya in Sanskrit; Was a great powerful emperor of the Gupta dynasty
 unka rajya 380-412 i tak chalaa jisamen gupt rajvansh ne apana shikhar praapt kiya
 That period of the Gupta Empire is also called the Golden Age of India
 chandragupta dwitiya mahaan apane purv raja samudragupta mahaan ke putr the
 He achieved success by following an aggressive expansion policy and beneficial accession policy
 chandragupta dwitiya vikramaditya samudragupta ke eran abhilekh se spasht he ki unke bahut se putr pautra the, kintu apane antim samay main unhone chandragupta ko apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya
 It is also evident from the records of Chandragupta II and the later Guptasamrats that after the death of Samudragupta, only Chandragupta II became Guptasamrat
 kintu iske vipareet, anshrup main uplabdh 'devichandraguptam' evam katipay anya saahitiyik tathaa puratathvik abhilekh sambandhi pramaanon ke aadhaar par kuch vidvan ramgupta ko samudragupta kaa uttaradhikari pramanit karte hai
 Taking advantage of the disqualification of Ramgupta, Chandragupta defeated both his kingdom and the queen
 ramgupta kii aitihaasikta sandigdh he
 Ramgupta of copper coins obtained from Bhilsa etc
 must have been a local ruler of that region
 chandragupta dwitiya kii tithi kaa nirdhaaran unke abhilekhon aadi ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Chandragupta's, inscribed Mathura pillar inscription in 61, was written in the fifth year of his kingdom
 falat: unka rajarohan guptasanwat 61-5= 56= 375 i
 main hua
 The last known date of Chandragupta II is found on his Rajatamudras - Guptasamvat 90+ 0 = 409- 410 AD
 isse anumaan kar sakate hai ki chandragupta sambhavat: uparilikhit varsh tak shashan kar rahe the
 In contrast, the first known date of Kumaragupta i is found in the Gupta era 96 = 415 AD, from his Bilsand inscription
 is adhar par, aisa anumaan kiya jaataa he ki, chandragupta dwitiya ke shasankaal kaa samaapan 413-14 i
 main hua hoga
 Devagupta and Devaraja-other names seem to be known from various articles of Chandragupta II
 abhilekhon evam mudralekhon se unki vibhinn oopaadhiyon- maharajaadhiraj, parambhagwat, shrivikram, narendrachandra, narendrasingh, vikramank ev vikramaditya aadi- kaa gyaan hota he
 His first military campaign was against the Saka satraps of Saurashtra
 sangharsh prakriya evam anya sambhddha vishyon kaa vistrut gyaan uplabdh nahin hota
 It is clear from Chandragupta's Udayagiri cavalry of the Sandhivagrihaka Veerasena Shaab, that he intended to reach the whole earth
 isi sthaan se praapt chandragupta ke samant shaasha sankanik maharaj ke guptasanwat 82 ke lekh tathaa amrakardav naam ke sainyadhikari ke sanchi guptasanwat 93 ke shilaalekh se maalav pradesh main unki deergh-upasthiti pratyaksh hoti he
 Probably Chandragupta II may have organized the battle of Saka Rudrasinh III and the rule of Saurashtra after victory
 chandragupta kii shakavijay kaa anumaan unki rajathamudraon se bhi hota he
 These postures also occur in imitation of Saurashtra's Shakamudra tradition
 saurashtra kii shaqmudra parampara ke anukaran main prachlit in mudraon par chandragupta dwitiya kaa chitra, naam, virud evam mudraprachlan kii tithi likhit he
 The last date known from Shaka currencies appears to be 388 AD
 iske vipareet in sikkon se gyaat chandragupta kii pratham tithi guptasanwat 90+ 0 he
 As a result, it can be inferred that Chandragupta's national victory would have been almost entirely successful only after 409 AD after 20 years of long war
 chandragupta ke senadhyaksh amrakardav, apane sanchi abhilekh main swayan ko, anek samarawaptvijayyashasupatak: kehete hai
 It can also be inferred from the mention of these many summers that Chandragupta must have fought other wars besides Shakya war
 kintu vartmaan sthiti main unka vivechan apramanit he
 a lunar triumph is engraved on the iron pillar at the side of Qutub Minar in Delhi
 chandra kii pahchaan pracheen bharat ke vibhinn samraaton se kii jaati rahi he 
 But often scholars identify him with Chandragupta II
 yadi is siddhant ko sahi mana jaay to kahana na hoga ki dwitiya chandragupta ne vang pradesh main sangathit rup se aae hue shatruon ko parajeet kiya evam sindhu ke saat mukhon ko paar kar vahlikon ko jeeta
 Vangs are generally identified from the East Bengal and Bahlik, although not surprisingly, the Wahlik lived in western Pakistan
 samrat chandragupta dwitiya ke saath chandra ke abhigyaan ko maanane main kathinaaiyaan bhi hai
 Chandragupta II received his kingdom in succession by his father, but the iron pillar Chandra mentions his self-proclaimed vast empire

 Chandragupta's empire was vast
 isamen purv main bengal se lekar uttar main sambhavat: balkh tathaa uttar-pashchim main arab sagar tak ke samast pradesh sammilit the
 With a view to providing stability to this vast empire, Chandragupta established matrimonial relationships with many powerful and Aishwaryamukhi royal families

 The influence emanating from Kuberanaga was married to Vagataknaresh Rudrasen II

 The empire was divided into various units to facilitate governance

 The provincial unit of governance was called Desh or Bhukti

 The department of the supreme government officer of Vaishali was called vaishali-adhisthana Adhikaran
 nagaraan evam graamon ke shashan ke liy alag parishad hoti thi
 Gramsikas, Mahtars and Bhojks were responsible for village governance
 chandragupta kii rajdhani patliputra thi
 But in the records of the later Kuntalnaras, he has been called both Patalipuravaradhishwar and Ujjayinipurvaradhishwar
 bahut sambhav he, ki shaq rudrasingh kii paraajay ke baad chandragupta ne hapane rajya kii duusari rajdhani ujjayini banaai ho
 In literature, Vikramaditya has also been associated with both these cities
 ujjayini vijay ke baad hi kabhi maalav sanwat vikramaditya ke naam se sambhddha hokar vikram-sanwat naam se abhihit hone laga hoga
 Thus, this year 58 BC Seems to have started chandragupta ke rajyakaal main chini yatri phahyan ne bharat kaa bhraman kiya

 Prior to Ernest Rutherford's theory of atomic structure, the presence of atoms in matter could be detected, but the information about the atom was further accelerated by Ernest Rutherford's experiments
 saalon pehle maharishi kanad ne yah bataa diya tha ki prayek padaarth bahut chote−chote kanon se milakar bana he
 In 1808, the British physicist John Dalton, based on his experiments, said that the indivisible particles of which the substance consists of are called atoms
 in parmaanuon kaa swatantra astitv sambhav he
 The experiments of scientists Thomson and Rutherford after Dolton improved Dolton's theory
 He made it clear that the atom is not inseparable but it consists of small charged particles
 1897 main sar thamsan ne parmaanu ke andar dhanaveshit kan kii upasthiti pramanit kii
 By that time, positive particles present inside the atom were said to remain in the scattered state inside the atom, such as cardamom seeds in Bundi laddus or its seeds inside water melon or dry fruits in Christmas pudding

 By far the prevailing theory about the atom, alpha particles should have collided across the gold foil at the same place on the screen, but Rutherford noticed that some alpha particles collided with the gold foil and were returning at different angles
 And some were also crossing it
 radarford ke prayog ne spasht kar diya ki parmaanu ke madhya kuch ghanaa dhanatmak bhaag he jisase alpha kan waapas laut rahe the
 By experiment they proved that this positive dense part is the 'nucleus' of the atom, in this nucleus the entire mass of the atom remains centered and the electrons revolve around this positive charge systematically

 The name of Acharya Mahim Bhatt is known in Sanskrit literature as a staunch opponent of the infinite sound principle of "kuntaka", the creator of Mahim Bhatt "vakroktivisht"
 inkaa granth "vyaktivivek" teen vimarshon main likhaa gaya he
 This book has been composed only for the purpose of inferring all kinds of sounds in guesses
 mangalacharan main hi mahim bhatta ne yah spasht kar diya he
 In its first discourse, the characterization of sound and its inference in inference, in second the interpretation of words and semantic impropriety, and in the third discourse forty examples of sound shown in "soundtrack" are conjectured
 dhvanikaar ne jis pratiyaman arth ko arthath vyangy ko vyanjanavriti kaa vyapaar or kavy main sarvapradhan chamatkaarkaarak tatv bataaya he, mahim bhatta use anumaan kaa vishay bataate hai
 They also reject the euphemism of the word and consider it only as an expression
 dhvanikaar ne shabd ke teen arth kahe hai -- abhidhey, lakshya or vyangy
 But Mahima assumes only two meanings, one permissible and the other permissible; As- mahim bhatta ullekhneey taarkik tathaa prakhar medhaavi aalochak the
 Refuting the sound, he has proved to be permissible to Rasa, thus furthering the permissiveness of Acharya Shankuk
 kavy main "ras" ko ye pranbhoot maanate hai or ras, bhav tathaa prakruti ke auchity ko bhi sweekaar karte hai
 According to him, the most imperfect of poetry is impropriety
 isamen kavy ke samast dosha kaa antarbhaav ho jaataa he
 The non-absence of rasa is the general form of this impropriety expressed in the "intimate" forms of being "intimate" and wordy due to the main emotions of poetry and being associated with rasa
 anauchity kii is prakaar vyakhya karte hue mahim bhatta, kavyagat dosha kaa aalochanatmak drushti se sookshm or pranjal vivechan karanevaalon main purvavarti thaharte hai
 He has produced five types of defects, which Mammatt has also accepted
 mahim bhatta kashmiri the
 His title was "rajanaka"
 inke pita kaa naam shridhirya tha or ye mahakavi shyaamal ke shishy the
 Mahim introduces himself at the end of "individualism"
 kshemendra ne apane granth "auchity-vichaar-charchaa" or "suvrittatilak" main shyaamal ke padya uddhrut kiye hai
 Rajanaka Ruyyak has commented on Mahim's treatise entitled "individual Discourse" and Acharya Mammatt refutes the ideas of "individualism" in the fifth verse of "kaviprakash"
 at: mahim bhatta kshemendra, mammat or ruyyak ke purvavarti tathaa aanandavardhan or abhinav gupt ke parvarti thaharte hai
 Thus, the period of "personality" and its creator Mahim Bhatt dates back to the 11th century CE

510429 palani dakshin bhartiya rajya tamilnadu ke dindigul jile main sthit ek shahar va nagarpalika he
 The city is located 100 km south of Coimbatore city and 60 km west of Dindigul Nagar
 yahan par bhagwaan kartikeya ko samarpit ek suvikhyath mandir he, jahaan prativarsh lagbhag 70 lakh bhakt darshan ke liye pahonchte hai
 The name Palani is derived from the combination of two Tamil words Palam and Ni, and the name originates from the legend of the main temple
 palani shabd kaa uccharan tamil akshar 'l ' ke nikatatam uccharan parimay kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa he, tathaa isliye angreji main ise "pazhani" bhi likhaa jaataa he
 This city is mentioned in the ancient Tamil devotional articles
 ek sthaneey kathanak ke anusaar behun naam kaa ek mukhiya tha, ek baar van main jate hue usne thand se thithurataa ek mor dekha
 use marane ke liye chhodane kii bajaay us mukhiya ne apane upar kaa vastra use pahana diya va swayan thand jhelta rahaa
 There is no proof of whether this plot is true or not, but it explains some interesting things; As if the population of that area was at least so high that they had a head, peacocks were in large numbers in that area and people used to offer them
 ve mor ko bhagwaan subramanyan kaa priy panchi maanate the, thik aise hi jaise aaj log maanate hai
 It is also clear that the weather was cold, due to which warm clothes were prevalent, although such weather now only happens on the mountains
 is yug main palani va adhiktar dindigul jila tamil kshetra ke kong nadu pradesh kaa hissaa tha
 The northern parts of Ottanchatram taluka and Palani were part of the Andadu sub-region, while the rest were part of Vaiyapuri Nadu
 aisa prathit hota he ki yah bhubhag madurai va coimbatore shaskaon ke prabhaav main rahaa
 The proof of this is the magnificent temple of the beautiful Bhagwati Periyanayaki Amman in the city
 The two-fish conspiracy emblem of kings is present in many places in this temple, which makes it known that in the first century this territory was under the influence of Pandyan kings of Madurai
 mandir ke aangan main bana mandapam haalanki madurai ke nayak shaskaon ke vaastushastra par aadhaarit he
 The Vijayanagar King was entrusted with the title of Vanvarayar in the 14th and 15th centuries to the Nayak rulers
 atah yah maan lenaa uchit prathit hota he ki nagar par nayak shaskaon kaa lanbaa varchasv rahaa
 It is prevalent in the region that the hero king of the city was almost independent, and self-respecting
 unhone kabhi pandya yaa coimbatore naresh kii daastaa sweekaar nahin kii
 This also reinforces the belief that there were some princely sons of the Pandya king who preferred to be called independent instead of readily accepting slavery, while some others became strongly Naresh's participants in various wars
 pandya rajya ke yuddh-aalekhon main is aashay kaa vistrut varnan miltaa he
 In the next period of time, we get articles from Gyan Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan
 tisare anglon-mysore yuddh ke baad jab dindigul kaa samarpan hua to in donon yoddhaon ko britash sena ne pakad kar yudhbandi bana liya
 It is also known from here that at that time Palani was under the Palingar or Palayakar leaders of Balasamudram, in return for the fort of the city, this Palayakar paid a nominal tax to the administrator and representative of the Sultan in Coimbatore
 aaj bhi balsamudram main naikar jati ke bahut log rahete hai
 They consider their origin as today's Andhra Pradesh, and even today speak a little Telugu
 isse yah abhas hota he ki inke purvajon ko madurai naresh ne palani kile kaa daayitv saunpa tha, tathaa madurai, naresh ke patan ke baad bhi inkaa varchasv kile par kaayam rahaa
 Another interesting thing is the Saurashtra road in Palani
 In Tamil literature the term 'saurashtra' is used to refer to those who came to be dominated by the Sarfoji kings of Thanjavur or Madurai
 yah vakt nayak raajaaon ke patan va 18veen sadi main haidar ali ke udgam main bich kaa samay tha
 The mention of Palani in geo-survey articles and official papers comes in many places during the British era
 palani va uske aasapaas ke kshetron kii pehali painting british east india company madras army ke ek captain ne banaai jinhen sitambar 1792 main dindigul kile kii adhikaar pradaan prakriya main sahaayta karne ke liye bheja gaya tha,
 is samay teesraa anglo-mysore yuddh charam par tha, tathaa aisa prathit hota he ki british company kaa unhen bhejne kaa ek aashay yah bhi tha ki dindigul ke kile ke patan ke baad yahan se coimbatore ke raste main padane vaale chote pahari kilon se koi virodh ke swar na uthne paayen
 is painting main shivgiri kii choti par bhavy mandir, neeche kii pracheer kii diwaar, ek bada sarovar, tathaa prishthbhumi main palani ke pahaad najar aate hai, jaise ki coimbatore kii disha se dekhne par pataa chalata he
 An official letter printed in 1821 in Dindigul district also mentions Palani as a wealthy city
 is shahar kii pragati main sambhawatah or chaar chaand tab lag gaye honge jab yahan rail kaa aagaman hua
 One of the major roads in the city is named Railway Feeder Route and it is believed that this road connects the Dindigul District Headquarters with the railway line
 us samay kii anya sadakon ke vipareet palani dharapuram ko jodne vaali sadak bilkul sidhi he jabaki us samay kii sadaken bahut mode yukt va ghumaavdaar hoti thim
 It is said that there was a lot of unemployment in the region after the Second World War

 Vidyapati gained fame in Bengal, Orissa and Assam
 in deshon main vidyapati ko vaishnav mana gaya or unke anukaran main anek kaviyon ne maithili main padaawaliyaan rachin
 The tradition of this literature has lasted till modern times
 20veen shatabdi main vishwakavi rabindra ne "bhanusinher padaavalee" ke naam se kai sundar brajabulid pad likhe
 The tradition of Vidyapati also continued in Mithila
 na keval inke radhakrishna sambandhi shringaarik geet, kintu shakti or shiv vishyak kavitaaon kaa bhi log abhyaas karne lage
 Among the contemporary poets of Vidyapati are Amritkar, Chandrakala, Bhanu, Dasavadhan, Vishnupuri, poets Shekhar Yashodhar, Chaturbhuj and Bhisham Kavi

 After the destruction of the Oinivar dynasty, most of the learned poets and musicians of Mithila went to Nepal's courts for protection
 vahaan ke mall raajaaon kii kavy or naatak kaa bada shauk tha
 Therefore a large part of medieval Maithili literature was written in Nepal itself
 nepal main rachit sahitya main natya sahitya mukhya tha
 In the first Sanskrit plays Maithili songs began to be disseminated
 kramash: unamem sanskrit or praakrit kaa vyavhaar kam hone laga or maithili main hi sampurna naatak likhe jane lage
 In the end, Sanskrit drama was also abandoned and an innovative tradition of Gitanatya was established
 inamen sangeet kii pradhanta rahati thi
 Most of the plot was expressed in gesture and prose was not practiced
 rajasabhaon main hi ye naatak abhinit hote the
 The theater was open and acting took place during the day
 kathanak naveen nahin hua karte the- bahudhaa puraane puranic aakhyaan yaa naatak ko hi phir se geetinaty kaa rup dekar athwa keval sanshodhan karke hi upasthit kar dete the
 The workplaces of Nepali playwrights were mainly in three places - Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Patan
 bhaktpur main sabase adhik naatak likhe gaye or abhinit hue
 The main playwrights were five - Jagjyotirmall, Jagatprakash Malla, Jitamitra Malla, Bhupatindra Malla and Ranjit Malla
 inamen sabase adhik naatak ranjit mall ne likhe
 19 plays made by him have been known so far
 kathmandu main sabase prasiddh naatakkaar vanshamani jha hue
 The greatest poet and playwright in Patan was Siddhanarsingh Malla
 nepali naatakon kii parampara 1768 isvi main nasht ho gai jab maharaj prithvinarayan shah ne vahaan ke mall raajaaon ko haraakar gurakhon kaa rajya sthapit kiya
 Maithili drama was becoming a Gitanatya tradition in the courts of Mithila, which is called 'kirtania drama'
 kirtaniya naatak kaa armbh praaia: shiv yaa krishna ke charitra kaa kirthan karne se hua
 But they were not religious dramas
 kirtaniya kaa abhinay raat ko hota tha tathaa iskaa apana vishesh sangeet hua karata tha jise naadi kehete hai
 Even at the beginning of Kirtania plays only Maithili songs were kept in Sanskrit plays
 ye gaan sanskrit shlonkon yaa vaakyon kaa arthmaatr lalit bhashaa main spasht karte the
 Yes, sometimes the independent anthem was also used
 kramash: lagbhag sampurna naatak maithili gaanamay hone laga
 Kirtania dramatists can be divided into three periods - from 1350–1700, 1700–1900 and 1900–1950
 pehle kaal main vidyapati kaa gorakshavijay, govind kavi nalcharitanaat, ramdaas kaa anandvijay, devanand kaa ushaaharan, umapati kaa parijataharan or ramapati kaa rukmani parinay gine ja sakate hai
 The most popular and famous Umapati Upadhyay was in it
 duusare kaal ke mukhya naatakkaar hai- laal kavi, nandipati, gakulanand, jayanand kanharam, ratnapani, bhanunath or harshnath
 Among them, the Gauri Swayamvar of Lal Kavi and the example of Harsh Nath and Maghavanand are more famous and important from the literary point of view
 tisare kaal ke lekhak vishwanath jha, "balaji", chanda jha or rajpandit baldev mishra hai
 His plays have more repetitions of songs and stanzas of ancient poets, a lack of dramatic struggle
 maithili naatak solahavin or satrahavin shatabdi main maithili naatak kaa ek rup assam main bhi viksati hua, sukhan jise ankia-naat kehete hai
 This is different from the traditions of both the above plays
 isamen lagbhag sampurna naatak gadhymay hi hota tha
 The narrator acted throughout the play
 abhinay se adhik varnanachamatkaar yaa paath kii ore dhyaan tha
 The purpose of these plays was not merely to entertain, but to propagate Vaishnavism
 adhiktar ye naatak krishna kii vatsalyamay lilaon kaa varnan karte the
 There were not more than one digit in them
 ankia naatakakaron main shankardev, madhavdev or gopaldev ke naam ullekhneey hai
 The most famous among them was Shankar Dev
 inkaa rukmaniharan naatak assam main sabase adhik lokapriy hai
 Prose Literature- The development of the form of Maithili prose can be known from the ancient donations and letters of this period
 inase us samay ke das pratha sambandhi vishyon kaa purna gyaan hota hai
 Apart from the Vidyapati tradition, Bhajjan Kavi, Lal Kavi, Karna Shyam Prabhranti were the main lyricists
 padya kaa ek nayaa vikaas lambey kavy, mahakavy, charit or sammer ke rup main hua inke lekhakon main krishnajanm karta manvodh, nandapati ratipati or chakrapani ullekhneey hai

 At the same time certain literary and social institutions were established which took part in the completion of the new awakening work

 The width of the lease of this earth was about 1,600 km from north to south, i
e
 its area was quite large
 pichley himyug ke dauraan samudron kaa bahut sa pani barf ke rup main jamaa hua hone se samudr-tal aaj se neeche tha jis vajah se beringia ek jamini kshetra tha
 At the end of the ice age, many of the ice melted, rose to sea level and Berinjia sank below the sea
 jab beringia astitv main tha to kshetreey mausam anukool hone kii vajah se yahan barfabaari kam hoti thi or vaataavaran madhya asia ke stapi maidaanon jaisaa tha
 Historians believe that at that time some human groups migrated from Asia and settled here
 vah beringia se aage uttar america main daakhil nahin ho paae kyonki aage bhimkaay himaniyaan unka rasta roke hue thim
 After this, with a snow wall between Berinjia and Asia, a few thousand humans on Berinjia survived the terrible outbreak of the Ice Age without contact with other humans for almost 5,000 years
 aaj se qareeb 16,500 varsh pehle himaniyaan pighalane lagi or ve uttar america main pravesh kar gaye
 Around the same time, Berinjia also began to drown in water, and from about 6,000 years ago, the coasts became like the ones seen in the modern era
 beringia lagbhag 4,000 kimi lambaa or 1,600 kimi chaudaa tha
 It ran from the Lena River in modern Siberia to the Mackenzie River in Canada
 iskaa kshetra itnaa bada tha ki kuch bhuvaigyanikon ke anusaar yah ek jamini pul kam or ek upmahadweep zyaada tha
 By conducting research on the collagen present in the bones of mammoth remains, scientists have argued that western Berinjia was much drier and colder than Eastern Berinjia and therefore there was greater richness and diversity of creatures and plants in eastern Berinjia
 beringia ek bada kshetra tha or iskaa adhiktar bhaag himanion se mukt tha or iske stapi jaise kshetra par bahut se jaanavar rahete the
 That's why even a few thousand humans could live here
 mana jaataa he ki yah 5-17 hazaar saal tak beringia main rahe or duusare maanav samaajon se inkaa koi sampark nahin tha
 Some historians think that the Paleolithic culture of Belgian humans at one time spanned the whole of Berinjia from the Primordia region of Siberia in the east to Alaska in the west and Hokkaido in the south
 beringiaayiyon ke koi avshesh nahin milen hai kyonki yah puraa upmahadweep ab sagar ke neeche duba hua he
 The life of these Berinjians was certainly difficult because it was a very cold terrain
 yah ek shikari-faramar jeevani vyateet karte the or ausatan 40 saal se bhi kam umr tak jite honge
 In summer a large number of mosquitoes and other pests will disturb them, as is also seen in Siberia
 jab mausam badla or unka ilaaka doobane par beringian uttar america main jane par majaboor hue, to unhen america kii alag aab-o-hawa main nae sire se jivan vyateet karnaa siikhnaa padaa hoga
 a genetic research conducted in 2005 indicates that perhaps less than 80 lineages of Berinjians have survived to modern times, that is, all others have ended up without running into further trouble
 beringia par oont, maimath, america singh, ghode, hiran, bhed, bhediya or stapi bhainse jaise jaanavar rahaa karte the
 Elephants, hairy rhinoceros and lions are now extinct in North America, but they reached there from Asia through this ground bridge
 adhyayan se yah bhi gyaat hua he ki vastav main unton kaa vansh sabase pehle uttar america main shuru hua tha or oont vahaan se beringia se guzarakar asia or vishwa ke anya bhaagon main pahunche
 Historians speculate that Berinjian humans became adept at hunting them in Berinzia amidst giant animals like mammoths
 baad main jab yah falkar alaska or uttar america ke anya bhaagon main gaye to vahaan bhi unhone apni maharath se bade paimaane par in bade jaanwaron kaa shikaar jari rakhaa
 It is believed to be a major cause of the extinction of mammoths, mastodons and hairy rhinoceros in the North American continent
