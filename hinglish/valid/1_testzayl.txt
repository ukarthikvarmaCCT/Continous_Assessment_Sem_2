 "parimit tatv" yahaan punarnirdesh karata he ek sthiti ke tatwon ke liye, compact tatv dekhen
 The finite element method is a numerical method for solving engineering and mathematical physics problems
 ise parimit tatv vishleshan bhi kaha jaataa he
 Typical problem areas of interest include structural analysis, heat transfer, fluid flow, mass transport, and electromagnetic capacity
 in samasyaon kaa vishleshnatmak samaadhaan aam taur par aanshik antar samikarnon ke liye seemaa mulya samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The problem in a system of algebraic equations is the result of formulating the finite element method
 is vidhi ne domen par asatat ankon kii sankhya main agyaat ke anumaanit mulyon ko praapt kiya he
 To solve the problem, it divides a larger problem into smaller, simpler parts called finite elements
 in samamit tatwon ke model ko saral samikarnon ko tab samikarnon kii ek badi pranali main ikattha kiya jaataa he jo puri samasya ko model banaati he
 The FEM then uses differential methods by calculating different solutions by minimizing an associated error function
 ek sampurna domen ke saral bhaagon main upavibhag main kai phaayde hai: a typical work of the method involves dividing the domain of the problem into a collection of subdomains, with each subdomain represented by a set of element equations of the original equation, then recombining all sets of ordered element equations
 Is the global system of equations for the final calculation, the global system of equations has known solution techniques, and a number Mk can be calculated from the initial values of the underlying problem to get answers
 upar ke pehle charan main, tatv sameekaran saral sameekaran hote hai jo mul rup se mul jatil samikarnon kaa anumaan lagaate hai, jahaan mul sameekaran aksar aanshik antar sameekaran hote hai
 For the interpretation of approximations in this process, FEM is usually introduced as a special case of the Galerkin method
 ganitiya bhashaa main prakriya, avshisht or vajan kaaryon ke aantarik utpaada kaa abhinn ang bananaa or shunya ke abhinn ang ko sthapit karnaa he
 In simple terms, it is a process that minimizes the error of approximation by fitting test functions to pdes
 avshisht pareekshan kaaryon kii vajah se truti hoti he, or vajan kaary bahupaksheeya sanniktan fnction hote hai jo avshisht pariyojna karte hai
 The process eliminates all spatial derivatives from pdes, thus locally with PDE localization ye sameekaran set tatv sameekaran hai
 They are linear if the underlying PDE is linear, and vice versa
 bijiy sameekaran nirdhaarit karata he ki sthir rajya samasyaon main utpann sankhyatmak raikhik bijganit vidhiyon kaa upyog karke hal kiya jaataa he, jabaki saamaanya antar sameekaran set jo kshanik samasyaon main utpann hota he, sankhyatmak ekikaran dwaara hal kiya jaataa he, jaise ki ular kii vidhi yaa rej-katta vidhi
 In the above step, a global system of equations arises from the equations of the elements through the transformation of the coordinates of the global nodes of the domain from the local nodes of the subdomain
 is sthanik parivartan main sandarbh nirdeshaank pranali ke sambandh main lagu uchit unmukhikaran samaayojan shaamil hai
 This process is often performed by FEM software using coordinate data generated from subdomains

 FEA as an application in engineering is a computational tool for performing engineering analysis
 isamen chote tatwon main ek jatil samasya ko vibhajit karne ke liye mesh peedi takneekon ke upyog ke saath-saath fame elgoridam ke saath kodit software program kaa upyog bhi shaamil he
 In applying FEA, the complex problem is usually expressed in underlying physics such as the Euler – Bernoulli beam equation, the heat equation or the Navier – Stokes equation in either PDE or integral equations, while the divided small element complex problem is different in different physical arrangements
 Areas are represented
 jab jatil domen kii samasya kaa vishleshan karne ke liye epaie ek acha vikalp he, jab domen badalata he, jab vaanchit sateek puure domen par bhinn hota he, yaa jab samaadhaan chiknayee kaa abhaav he epaie simulation ek bahumoolya sansaadhan pradaan karte hai kyonki ve vibhinn ucch nishtha sthitiyon ke liye kathin prototip ke nirmaan or pareekshan ke kai udhaaharan nikaalte hai
 For example, in a frontal crash simulation it is possible to increase the accuracy of prediction in "critical" areas like the front of the car and reduce it in the rear

 The founder of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar was born on 1 April 1889 in a poor Brahmin family of Nagpur
 He was of revolutionary instinct since childhood and hated the British rulers
 While still studying in school, Keshav Rao, along with some of his classmates, greeted him with "vande Mataram" Jayghosh when the British inspector came to the school for inspection, on which he went to bipher and on his orders Keshav Rao was expelled from the school
 Gone Then he completed his studies till matriculation in the National School of Poona

 The result of this thought and brainstorm of Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar was the establishment of a branch system in the form of a rite called Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh which proved to be miraculous in appearance but simple in result

 In this, all the people who believe in and practice the views of religions and religions like Sanatani, Aryasamaji, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh etc
 are Hindu The Muslims and Christians did not fall under this definition, so it was decided not to take them in this militia and it was decided to take only Hindus, the main mantra
 Was "prevention of Ambiguity and Military Causes of Hindus"

 Prayers also came to be known as "prayers" started in Sanskrit language instead of Marathi
 For senior volunteers, OTC Camps were started where they were also given paramilitary education
 For all these works, the services of a retired military officer Mr
 Martande Rao Jog were used
 By 1935-36 such branches were limited to Maharashtra only and its volunteers
 The number was only a few thousand, but the enthusiasm of the Sarsanghchalak and volunteers was worth seeing
 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis
 " jab vir saavarkar ratnagiri main drushti band the, tab dow headgavar vahaan unase milane gayi
 By then he had also read the book Hindutva by Veer Savarkar
 dow headgavar us pustak ke vichaaron se bahut prabhavit hue or uski saraahna karte hue bole ki “vir saavarkar ek adarsh vyakti he”
 Both believed that Hindus would be divided into casteism, untouchability, urban-migrants and regionalism, till Hindus would not leave blind faith, old orthodox thinking, religious fanatics, and until it would be organized and united, Until then, he will not be able to take his rightful place in the world

 Media bias may be in the form of election of events and stories to be reported or may also be in the form of presentation
 media-adhyayan ke vidwaanon kii manyata he ki maas-media kaa avadharanatmak udgam propaganda he
 In the sixteenth century, Jesuit followers of Catholicism launched an anti-reform ideological campaign in response to criticism from Protestants based on what the Latin word 'propaganda' meant
 iske peeche samaj yah thi ki log tab tak koi sandesh aatmsaat nahin karte jab tak vah unhen baar-baar na diya jaae
 The process of messaging changed under the circumstances created after the European Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, as it became increasingly necessary to take care of the interests of voters, consumers and audiences

 sarkari mashinari ke bajaay ek rashtriya sahmati bana kar media ko raashtra or rajya-nirmaan kii pariyojna main laga kar sarkaron or rashtriya abhijanon ne bahut badi kamyaabi hasil kii
 Since mass media can produce mass publicity content through entertainment, news, analytics, advertising, and interactive discussions, the corporate world, the nation-state, and the world can exploit its propaganda-related capabilities in the twentieth century
 Advocates of political ideologies have developed open and hidden tricks
 media kii taraf se vyaavhaarikta kii daleel di jaati he ki sabhi tathyon or ghatnaon kii rapat prasaarit nahin kii ja sakati, isliye unamem se kuch ko chunanaa or kuch ko chhodana hi padataa he
 This process of selection and sorting only creates favoritism and helps in building pre-determined consent
 vigyapakon ko kush karne ke liye, media-maalikon ke hiton ko saadhane ke liye, bahusnkhyakon yaa alpsankhyakon kii kathith bhaawanaaon ko thes na lagane dene ke naam par or raashtra-rajya kii pradhan vichaardhaara ko pusht karne ke liye chuninda tathyon par jor diya jaataa he
 The religious, racial, sexual, age-related, sexist, casteist and ethnicist dimensions of media-bias are also outlined
 sabhi log jaanate hai ki media pakshpaat karata he, par uske is ravaiye ko chihnit karnaa or uski vistrut aalochana karnaa ek mushkil kaam he
 In response to accusations of bias, media advocates often ask whether it is fair journalism to present a statement made by the two parties in their own right by a reporter going to report an incident
 These people say that 'balanced' reporting means spineless and edgeless journalism
 zaahir he ki yah tark tatasthta ko betuka maanate hue ‘pakshadharata’ or ‘patibaddhta’ ko ‘pakshpaat’ nahin maanata
 If the media is not trying to hide its favoritism, its unilateralism can be assumed as its quality
 lekin, agar tatasthta kii aad main ek khaas tarah kii sahmati gadhane kii koshish kii ja rahi he to uskaa pataa lagane or phir use zaahir karne ke liye vistrut adhyayan kii zarurat padati he
 According to a 2004 study, twelve methods can be used to spot media-bias: the political / cultural attitudes of journalists, media-elites and journalism students can be surveyed; Old professional contacts with journalists can be traced; Quotes inaugurating the political beliefs of prominent journalists can be submitted; The use of keywords can be done by using the computer to find out the essence and range of media content; The policies suggested by news stories can be studied; Negative / positive coverage of an event can be underlined; The career of those in the media can be looked at with decision-making powers in their hands; Information / entertainment-advertising-influencing sources can be studied; The impact of the government propaganda and public relations industry on the media can be noted, experts and spokespersons selected for commentary by the media can be seen against the interest groups and ideology advocates who are not the media Chooses; And the payments made in lieu of the speeches made by the corporations and commerce associations to journalists, etc
 can be looked at
 media kii pakshadharata kaa vishleshan karne ke maamle main glassgo media group kaa adhyayan kaafii charchit hua he jisamen yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii gayi thi ki tivi or akhbaar mazdoor andolan ke kilaaf kis tarah corporate hiton kii seva karte hai
 This study has also been accused of bias in that the expressions used by the media about the workers as derogatory are derived from the self-described narration by the workers
 media or propegande ke bich spasht sambandh sthapit karne vaala ek vikhyath adhyayan nom chomski ke prayaason kaa parinaam he jisamen dikhaaya gaya he ki swatantra media kii saakh ko thes pahunchaane ke liye america kii corporate shaktiyaan kis tarah ‘communist virdohi vichaardhaara’ ke filtaron kaa istemaal karti hai
 On the other hand, studies on the media of developed countries have shown that it generally favors liberal ideology over conservatism
 1986 main media-abhijanon par hue ek adhyayan se yah hakeekat saamne aayi thi ki neuyork times or washington post jaise bade akhbaaron or prasaaran networkon ke newzarumon main baayen baazuu ke udaarataavaadi rujhaanon kaa bolbalaa rahata he
 The attitude that journalists and analysts generally take regarding social and political disputes has a deep imprint on their personal views
 media-pakshpaat or bhartiya media kaa sameekaran pashchim jaisaa nahin rahaa he
 Before independence, the entire Indian media was divided into two poles
 angrezi ke sabhi bade akhbaar khul kar aupniveshik shashan kaa samarthan karte the or bhartiya bhashaaon kaa media bina kisi apwaad ke rashtriya andolan ke paksh main khadaa hua tha
 This can be seen as an example of the difference between 'favoritism' and 'partiality'
 1947 main pandrah agast ko satta-hastantaran hote hi angrezi media raaton-raat rashtriya media main badal gaya
 After this, by the late eighties, all aspects of the media contributed in their own way to the national consensus to pave the way for India's socio-political modernization and the model of mixed economies based on developmental economics
 nabbe ke dashak main mandir, mandal or bazaar kii udiyaman takaton ke ird-gird bhartiya raajnneeti or samaaj main naye dhruvikaran hue jinhone us rashtriya sahmati ko bhang kar diya
 Different sections of the media, sometimes adopting an attitude of favoritism and partiality, began to support and oppose these powers from time to time
 aaj sthiti yah he ki bhartiya media lagbhag bina kisi apwaad ke aarthik sudhaaron or bhoomandaleekaran kaa paksh le rahaa he
 The media has accepted this as a new national consensus

 During this period, social reformers, writers and artists challenged the established traditions related to women, marriage, dowry, caste system and religion
 bengal ke is ghatnakram ne samgr bhartiya aadhuniktaa kii nirmitiyon par amit chhap chodi
 It was during this renaissance that structures of the earliest forms of Indian nationalism emerged
 bengal ke navajagaran kaa vistaar raja rammohan raay se armbh hokar rabindranath thakur tak mana jaataa he
 Historian Sushobhan Sarkar, who conducted a systematic study of this period, writes, 'english rule, capitalist economy and modern western culture had its first impact on Bengal, which led to a renaissance which is commonly known as the Renaissance of Bengal
 kareeb ek sadi tak badalati hui aadhunik duniya ke prati bengal kii sachet jaagrukta shesh bharat ke mukaable aage rahi
 In this context, it can be said that the role played by Bengal in the modern awakening of India can be compared to the role of Italy in the context of European Renaissance
 ’ italvi rinesaan kii hi tarah bengal kaa navajagaran koi janandolan nahin tha
 Its process and spread was limited to Bhadralok
 bhadralok main bhi navajagaran kaa prabhaav adhiktar uske hindu hisse par hi padaa
 Some Muslim personalities also emerged during this period, but the renaissance of Bengal can be partly called the Muslim Renaissance
 mote taur par mana jaataa he ki bengal ke navajagaran kii shuruyaat rammohan raay se hui or rabindranath thakur ke saath uskaa samaapan ho gaya
 The Sushobhan government has tried to divide it into five stages: the first period 1814 to 1833, whose central figure was Raja Rammohan Roy
 1814 main ve kolkata rahane ke liye aaye or 1833 main unka landan main dehanth hua
 The second period goes from his death to the Revolt of 1857
 teesri avadhi 1885 main bhartiya rashtriya congress kii sthapana tak faili hui he
 The fourth period dates back to the partition of Bengal in 1905 and the fifth period from the Swadeshi movement to the non-cooperation movement and the beginning of Mahatma Gandhi's leadership i
e
 1919
 rammohan raay ke bare main ek drushtaant he jise unki shakhsiyat ke roopak kii tarah padhaa ja saktaa he
 He is said to have had two houses
 khan-paan, veshbhusha or rahan-sahan ke lihaaz se ek main kisi victorian jentilmen kii bhanti rahete the or duusare main parmparik bengali brahman kii tarah
 Indeed, the greatest feature of his personality and work was the synthesis of East and West
 lekin, yah drushtaant bhi unke roodhibhanjak vyaktitv ko paribhaashit nahin karata
 In 1820, his work 'percepts of Jesus' was published in which the moral message of Jesus was separated from Christian philosophy and miracle tales
 bengal main sakriy isai padri varg unki is koshish se naaraaz ho gaya
 As a result of his opposition, Rammohun Roy gave more clarity to his views by issuing three appeals to the Christian public
 isi ke saath unhone brahmanical megazin kaa prakaashan karke hindu aastikta ke vaicharik nairantary ko vedon ke hawaale se rekhaankit karne kii cheshtaa bhi kii
 On 20 August 1828, Rammohan formed the 'brahma Sabha' to bring his religious ideas to earth
 is prakriya kaa parinaam 1830 main ek carch kii sthapana ke rup main niklaa or brahm samaaj andolan shuru hua jo lambe samay tak bengali samaaj kii chetana ko prabhavit karata rahaa
 Between 1818 and 1829, Rammohun Roy published three compositions attacking the evil like the practice of sati
 sati pratha ke kilaaf janamat banane or angrezon ko us par pratibandh lagane ke liye manaane kaa shrey unke prayaason ko hi diya jaataa he
 Rammohan played a pioneering role in the spread of modern education and especially female education
 unhen bangla gadhy kaa nirmaataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Rammohan's efforts faced double opposition in this phase of Bengal Renaissance
 ek taraf unka virodh radhakant deb, gaurikant bhattacharya or bhavani charan banerjee jaise sudhaar virdohi paramparanishth lekhak or vidwaan kar rahe the, vahiin unhen francisi kranti or inglish radicalizam se anupranit aalochana kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa jiskaa netritv ‘yang bengal’ or uske anglo-indine netaa henry vivian derozio ke haathon main tha
 It is a different matter that Derozio's followers were not able to make any lasting impact other than shocking the society with their works and oratory
 lekin, rammohan kii parampara ke aadhaar par samaaj sudhaaron kaa naram kaarykram unki mrityu ke baad bhi jari rahaa
 He was commanded by Devendranath Thakur and Akshay Kumar Dutt
 isi dauraan ishwarchandra vidyasagar ne bal vivaah or bahuvivaah ke kilaaf muhim chalaayi
 Although the Young Bengal Movement raised its voice in favor of widow marriage in 1842, it became a popular movement only due to Vidyasagar's efforts
 1857 ke vidroh ke baad bengal ke punarjagran ne saahitiyik kranti or uske zariye rashtravaadi chintan ke yug main pravesh kiya
 Bengali intellectuals also joined their voices in the struggle of the peasants against the British oppression of indigo
 deenabandhu mitra ke naatak ‘nil darpan’ ne bengal ke maanas ko jhakzor diya
 Michael Madhusudan Dutt published an English translation against which the court sentenced him to a fine of one thousand rupees
 micel ne 1860 main meghnad-vadh kii rachana karke nayi bengali kavita kii sambhaawanaaon kaa udghosh kiya
 In 1865 Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's sun rose on the Bengali cultural horizon with his first historical subcaste, Durgeshanandini
 1873 main vishabruksh ke zariye unhone saamaajik upanyaason kii parampara kaa sutarapaat kiya
 By writing an essay titled 'samya' in 1879, Bankim showed a tendency towards egalitarianism and utopian socialism, but by writing Anandamath in 1882, he was swept away by a wave of patriotic revivalism
 isi rachana main darj ‘vandemataram’ geet bharat ke teen raashtragiton main se ek he
 Along with literary innovation, the Bengali Renaissance also heralded the tradition of contribution to historiography and other fields of sociology
 dharmik sudhaaron or punarutthanavaad ke lihaaz se bhi yah daur khaasaa ghatnaprad tha
 On the one hand, under the leadership of Keshav Chandra Sen, the young Brahm was awakening in the Samaj reform movement, on the other hand, the Wahhabi dissent was seething and the footsteps of neo-hinduism were being heard
 isi avadhi main dakshineshwar ke sant ramakrishna paramhans ne apane chumbakeey vyaktitv ke madhyam se sabhi dharmik aasthaaon ko pavitra ghoshit kiya
 Protestant extremism that fueled Christian conversion weakened it and gave little relief to the advocates of the tradition
 paramhans ke yuva shishy swami vivekanand ne 1893 main world relijas conference main diye gayi apane bhaashan se antarrashtriya khyaati arjeet kii or apni khaas style ke adarshavaadi rashtrawaad kaa sutrikaran kiya
 In 1897, when he returned after touring the West for four years, he was welcomed as a national hero
 1861 ke baad kii avadhi to kuch is tarah kii thi jisamen bengali buddhijivi samaaj kaa sabase priy shabd ‘rashtriya’ ban gaya
 a variety of activities were led by Rajnarayan Bose, Navagopal Mitra, Jyotirindranath Thakur and Bhudev Mukherjee, notable for organizing the Hindu fair which has been critical of Kolkata for nearly ten years
 1870 ke baad kii avadhi raajnneetik andolanon kii avadhi thi jisamen surendranath banerjee kaa netritv ubhara jinhen ‘bengal ke betaj ke badshaah’ ke taur par janaa gaya
 Due to the militant cause of Surendranath, the British spoiled his name and also called 'surrender not' Banerjee
 1876 main banerjee ne ‘indine association’ kii sthapana kii jiske 1883 ke rashtriya sammelan main sabhi bharatiyon ke liye ek rashtriya sanghathan banane kaa vichaar paidaa hua
 This resulted in the historic founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885

 gilgamesh, pracheen sumeri virakavy or uske nayak kaa naam
 Gilgamesh narrates the story of the deluge in that poem in the face of his ancestor Jiusudu, the forerunner of Manu and Noah, how he collected pairs of creatures in his boats to protect them on the occasion of the Holocaust

 Gilgamesh, besides being the oldest heroic poem in the world, is probably the first book of mankind
 isamen gilgamesh naam ke uruuk ke ati pracheen raja ke virochit kaaryo kaa vrittant sangrakshit he
 It is known from that tradition that Gilgamesh conquered Uruk by besieging him for many years
 pashchaat vah vahiin nirankush hokar shashan karne laga or tab devataaon ko baadhya hokar anki-du naam ke ardhamanav ardhapashu ko uske sanhaar ke liye bhejnaa padaa
 Gilgamesh sent an attractive lady to win her, who won her with deceit yesterday
 us nari se prabhavit hokar vah gilgamesh ke darbar main aayaa or donon mitra ho gaye
 Then the two conquered many cities together and in search of a terrible monster, they crossed the desert, the rugged and the jungle and went to the north west where they killed the monster and won its stronghold
 gilgamesh kaa yah virakavy pracheen babuli kathankon or saahitiyik rachanaaon main sabase madhur, sabase sundar he or lokapriy to yah kavy itnaa hua ki jahaan jahaan kilnuma lipi kaa prachaar hua vahaan vahaan vah katha bhi prachlit hui
 Its earliest Sumerian text is found in a broken condition, but the entire text that Dr
 campbell-tamson has presented, including several later versions of it, is given below
 gilgamesh virakavy 12 patticaon athwa eenton par likhaa hua mila he
 The story begins on the first brick in which Gilgamesh arises from the half-vampire half-manus father and the goddess Ninsun Mata, who torments his subjects through autocratic rule
 uski uruuk kii praja tab raksha ke liye devataaon se prarthana karti he or devtaa anki-du naamak adbhut jeev ko gilgamesh ke sanhaar ke liye bhejte hai
 At first he comes among the wild animals and is very happy with them, though he is not one of their kind
 registan ke aheri tak gilgamesh se uske bhayanak rup kaa varnan karte hue shikaayat karte hai ki jab jab ve pashu pakadte hai tab tab anki-du jalgat jeevon ko swatantra kar detaa he
 Gilgamesh then sends a devadasi to her who seduces her by her gestures
 duusari eent kaa paath he ki anki-du ko devdasi roti khaanaa or sura pinaa sikhaati he or use sabhy banaakar vah gilgamesh ke darbar me le jaati he jahaan donon pehle dwandv yuddh karte hai phir ek duusare kii shakti se prabhavit hokar paraspar aaajeevan maitri ke sutara main bandh jate hai
 According to the third brick account, the two friends go to Syria or Levanan to attack the thick forests
 deodaaron ke us van kii huwava naam kaa bhayanak daitya raksha karata he jisaki garaj aandhi kii tarah he, jiskaa munh aag kii lapaton kii tarah he or jisaki saansmout kii saans he
 Anki-du is horrified to hear of that gruesome monster, but Gilgamesh encourages him and the two go off in search of the monster, irrespective of the warnings of Uruk's elders
 chauthi eent main unke raah ke sankat jhelte deodaaron ke van tak pahunch jane kaa vrittant he or paanchaven main gilgamesh anek swapnon dwaara aakraant hota he jinaki vyakhya anki-du daitatya huwava ke naash kii ore sanket dwaara karata he
 Pleasing Gilgamesh, the Sun then sends its eight winds against the monster and Gilgamesh finally beheads the monster
 chhathi eent ke anusaar donon vijayi vir uruuk lautate hai
 Goddess Ininnah now expresses her love for Gilgamesh, but he refuses her love by pointing to the story of her predecessor's destruction
 tab devi khijhakar apane pita devtaa an se gilgamesh ke sanhaar ke liye daivi saand kii sristi ke arth prarthana karti he
 The deity gives the bull an elephant, whose arrival at the city of Gilgamesh causes tragedy on the citizens
 ant main anki-du uski sing pakadakar use patake detaa he, phir donon mitra use maar daalate hai or uski sing katkar lugalabanda ke mandir main taang dete hai
 An extraordinary feast is organized to commemorate this great act, but the night is full of terrible dreams for anki-du
 saatvin eent ke anusaar anki-du sapane main dekhtaa he ki devtaa apni sabha main nishchay karte hai ki saand ke vadh ke falswaroop use maar daalaa jaae or anki-du jagakar apane bhagya ko kosne lagata he ki kyon vah gilgamesh kii bheji ramani ke chakkar main fasaa, kyon usne sade registan kaa sukhi jivan chhod maanvon kii khatre kii duniyaan main pravesh kiya? phir suryadev kii bhartsana ke baad vah us nari ko aashirwad detaa he
 In the eighth brick account, Gilgamesh honors his mortal friend
 parantu anki-du kii shakti nirantar ghatati jaati he or dhire dhire uske praan nikal jate hai
 Gilgamesh then mourns his death and burying him covered with mud
 swayan gilgamesh ko ek din apane sambandh main bhi ghatanevaali mrityu kaa sahasaa dar ho aata he or vah jalpralay ke vir nayak apane purvaj jiusuddu kii khoj main chal padataa he jisase vah amarta kaa bhed usase le le
 This journey is described in the ninth brick account
 anek jeevon dwaara rakshit bheeshan parvaton kii yatra sampann kar vah samudr kii gaharaaiyon main rahanevaali devi se miltaa he jiske prati dasvin eent ke anusaar vah apni pichhali yatra kaa varnan karata he
 Hearing of her discovery of the goddess immortality, she is encouraged to return home and live the expected life of a human, but Gilgamesh goes ahead to listen to her and meets the sailor who is riding a boat in the sea of death
 naav or paal tod dene kii dhamkee se darkar navik ant main gilgamensh ko mrityusagar ke paar jaakar uske purvaj jiusuddu ke samaksh khadaa kar detaa he
 Jiusudu is surprised to see her and Gilgamesh asks him the mantra of immortality
 aage, 11veen eent kii kahani main us jalpralay kaa varnan he, us virakavy ke bheetar ke virakavy kaa, jiske nayak kaa kaary swayan jiusuddu ne kiya tha
 Jiusudu then reveals to him the secret of the immortal medicament that rises to the bottom of the ocean, and Gilgamesh overthrows the medicine to the bottom of the ocean
 navik tab use martyon ke jagat main lautaa laata he or gilgamesh snaan ke liye ek talab ke tat par aa khadaa hota he
 While bathing, a snake, affected by the smell of the medicine, runs away and enters the pond and leaves his old snake and takes the latest
 tab gilgamesh is nae sankat se aahat vilaap karne lagata he or uski aankhon se ansu bah chalate hai
 The Veerakavya ends virtually right here, although the account of a brick, the 12th, presents its epilogue which is probably added backwards
 isaki katha ke anusaar vruddh or atyant dukhi gilgamesh mrityuparant manushya kii dasha jaanane ke liye devtaa nergal kii sahaayta se pataal lok jaataa he
 There he meets the phantom of his friend anki-du who explains to him the secret of phantom life
 kahata he ki kabr main dafnadie jane ke baad keede vastra kii bhanti tan ko kha jate hai or pret raat main sadakon par bhatakta mel khaataa or ganda jal peetaa phirata he
 When his descendants pay obeisance to him, he gives him drinks and food only then he is able to live peacefully
 kavy kaa ant nitant du:khamay he
 Scholars estimate that the hero of this heroic poem was the historical king of Uruk, who ruled southern Babylon in 3000 BC
 Ruled just a few years before, just a few hundred years after the Flood
 gilgamesh kavy kii kahani sumeri he, yadhyapi vah likhi akkadi yaa sami kaal main gai or jahaan jahaan kilnuma lipi kaa prachaar hua vahaan vahaan kii videshi bhashaaon main bhi vah likh lee gai
 The story of the deluge is a part of this poem

 According to another legend, when Lord Vishnu took incarnation of Vamana, he came to King Bali to receive the Trilokya as a donation
 vishnu ne prahlaad ke pautra mahabali se vaaman ke chhadam rup main daan swaroop trailoky le lene kaa prayaas kiya
 But Shukracharya recognized him and warned the king
 haalanki raja bali apane vachan kaa pakkaa tha or vaaman devtaa ko munhmaanga daan diya
 Shukracharya, unhappy at this act of sacrifice, made himself extremely small and hid in the beak of the sacrifice of King Bali
 isi kamandalu se jal lekar bali ko daan kaa sankalp purna karnaa tha
 Then Vishnu recognized him and picked up a straw from the ground and opened the beak of Kamandalu from its tip

 His costumes are very much like the headless statue of Emperor Kanishka, derived from Mathura itself
 bharat main ye surya kii sabase pracheen murtiyon he
 No statue of the sun has been found before the Kushan period, so it is believed that in India he started worshiping the sun statue and he also gave the costumes of the sun as he himself wore it

 Marwar and northern Gujarat were part of the empire of Kanishka
 bhinmaal ke jagaswami mandir ke atirikt kanishka ne vahaan ‘karada’ naamak jhil kaa nirmaan bhi karaayaa tha
 Kanishka is also credited with settling a city called Kanakavati seven centuries before Bhinmal

 Deora / Devara, people got this name because they built Jagaswamy Surya Mandir

 Drama is a form of poetry
 jo rachana shravan dwaara hi nahin apitu drushti dwaara bhi darshakon ke hriday main rasanubhuti karaati he use naatak yaa drishy-kavy kehete hai
 The play has more elegance than audio poetry
 shravy kavy hone ke kaaran yah lok chetana se apekshaakrit adhik ghanishtha rup se sambhddha he
 Folk consciousness in the Natyasastra has been considered the primary inspiration for the writing and staging of the play
 naatak kii ginati kaavyon main he
 Poetry is considered to be of two types - audio and visual
 isi drishy kavy kaa ek bhed naatak mana gaya he
 But mainly because of its eclipse by sight, visuals have started to call poetry as drama
 bharatmuni kaa naatyashaastra is vishay kaa sabase pracheen granth miltaa he
 The Agnipuran also has a representation of the characteristics of drama etc
 usamen ek prakaar ke kavy kaa naam prakeern kaha gaya he
 This book has two distinctions - poetry and actors
 agnipurana main drishy kavy yaa roopak ke 27 bhed kahe gaye hai— Characteristics, distinctions, etc
 of the play are given more clearly in the literature
 upar likhaa ja chukaa he ki drishy kavy ke ek bhed kaa naam naatak he
 There are two main categories of visual poetry - metaphor and metaphor
 roopak ke das bhed hai— roopak, naatak, prakaran, bhaan, vyayog, samavakaar, dim, ihamrig, ankavithi or prahasan
 There are eighteen distinctions of 'uparupaka' - Natika, Trotak, Goshthi, Sattak, Natyarasak, Departure, Ullapya, Kavya, Observance, Rasak, Sanlapak, Shrigadit, Shimpak, Vilasika, Durmallika, Kesika, Halisha and Bhanika
 uparyukt bhedon ke anusaar naatak shabd drishy kavy maatr ke arth main bolte hai
 According to the literature, the play should be written with a 'famous circle'
 vah bahut prakaar ke vilaas, sukh, dukh, tathaa anek rason se yukt hona chahie
 It should contain from five to ten digits
 naatak kaa nayak dhirodatt tathaa prakhyat vansh kaa koi pratapi purush yaa rajarshi hona chahie
 The principal or angi rasa of the play is Shringar and Veer
 shesh ras gaun rup se aate hai
 The metaphor in which tranquility, peace, compassion etc
 can not be called drama
 sandhisthal main koi vismayajanak vyapaar hona chahie
 Mars must be shown in the epilogue
 viyogant naatak sanskrit alankaar shaastra ke viruddh he
 The action that takes place before the acting starts, is called puvarang
 purvarang, ke uparaant pradhan nat yaa sutaradhar, jise sthaapak bhi kehete hai, aakar sabha kii prashansa karata he phir nat, nati sutaradhar ityadi paraspar vaartalap karte hai jisamen khele janevaale naatak kaa prastaav, kavi-vansh-varnan aadi vishay aa jate hai
 This part of the play is called the prologue
 jis itivrutt ko lekar naatak rachaa jaataa he use 'vastu' kehete hai
 There are two types of 'object' - official object and relevant object
 jo samast itivrutt kaa pradhan nayak hota he use 'adhikari' kehete hai
 Whatever is described in relation to this officer is called 'official object'; Like, the character of Rama in Ramlila
 is adhikari ke upkaar ke liye yaa raspushti ke liye prasangvash jiskaa varnan aa jaataa he use praancegik vastu kehete hai; jaise sugriv, aadi kaa charitra
 'to bring to the fore' means to present a visual face
 atah avasthanurup anukaran yaa swaang kaa naam hi abhinay he
 There are four types of acting - Aangik, Vachik, Dietary and Satvik
 angon kii cheshtaa se jo abhinay kiya jaataa he use angik, vachanon se jo kiya jaataa he use vaachik, bhes banaakar jo kiya jaataa hai use aharya tathaa bhaavon ke udrek se camp, swead aadi dwaara jo hota he use satvik kehete hai
 The seed, point, flag, light and action in the play are achieved by these five
 jo baat munh se kehete hi chaaron ore fail jaay or falsiddhi kaa pratham kaaran ho use beej kehete hai, jaise venisanhaar naatak main bhim ke krodh par yudhisthir kaa utsaahvaaky draupadi ke keshmojan kaa kaaran hone ke kaaran beej he
 If one thing is fulfilled, then even if it is not related to the other sentence, bring such sentences in it which are not incompatible with the other sentence is 'point'
 bich main kisi vyapak prasang ke varnan ko pataakaa kehete hai— jaise uttarcharit main sugriv kaa or abhigyaan- shankutal main vidooshak kaa charitravarnan
 a country wide characterization is called Prakari
 aarambh kii hui kriya kii falsiddhi ke liye jo kuch kiya jaay use kaary kehete hai; jaise, ramlila main ravan vadh
 One topic is being discussed, in the meantime, if another topic is present and it is known in the mail with the first topic, there is a place of sign, like, in Ramcharit, Ram is saying to Sita - "oh dear! i am not intolerant about you, if it is unbearable, then only your antagonism, in the meantime, the Pratihari comes and says: God! Offense present
 yahan ' upasthit' shabd se 'virah upasthit' aisi prathit hota he or ek prakaar kaa chamatkaar maaloom hota he
 Many similar drama-related skills have been introduced in Sanskrit literature and various types of differentiation have been shown
 aajkal deshbhashaon main jo nae naatak likhe jate hai unamem sanskrit naatakon ke sab niyamon kaa paalan yaa vishyon kaa samavesh anaavashyak samajha jaataa he
 Bharatendu Harishchandra writes - 'like a Sanskrit drama, it is futile to research them in Hindi drama or to write a play diligently in a Natakang; Because by editing the ancient natakadi, adorning the modern signs, the opposite happens and the effort is wasted
 bharat main abhinay-kala or rangamanch kaa vaidic kaal main hi nirmaan ho chukaa tha
 After that, Sanskrit theater had reached the pinnacle of its progress - Bharati Muni's Natyashastra is the proof of this
 bahut pracheen samay main bharat main sanskrit naatak dharmik avasaron, saanskrithik parvon, saamaajik samarohon evam rajkeey bolchaal kii bhashaa nahin rahi to sanskrit naatakon kii manchikaran samaapt-sa ho gaya
 The promotion of plays in India is from very ancient times
 bharat muni kaa naatayashastra bahut purana he
 Nuts and dramas are mentioned in Ramayana, Mahabharata, Harivansh etc
 panini ne 'shilaali' or 'krishashv' naamak do natsutrakaron ke naam liye hai
 Shilali gets its name from Shukla Yajurvedi Shatapatha Brahmin and Samvediya Anupada Sutra
 vidwaanon ne jyotish kii gananaa ke anusaar shatapath brahman ko 4000 varsh se upar kaa batalaaya he
 Therefore, this opinion of some Western scholars rightly originated in drama in Greece or Greece, it is not right
 harivansh main likhaa he ki jab pradhyumna, samb aadi yadav rajkumaar vajranabh ke poor main gaye the tab vahaan unhone ramajanm or rambhaavisar naatak khele the
 Previously, he had tied the background, from which the women sang sweetly
 shur naamak yadav ravan bana tha, manovati naam kii stri rambha bani thi, pradhyumna nalkubar or samb vidooshak bane the
 Western scholars like Wilson etc
 have clearly acknowledged that the Hindus had developed drama on their own
 pracheen hindu raja bady bady rangashalas banavaate the
 Surguja is a hilly place in Madhya Pradesh, there are signs of a theater of this type found inside a cave
 yah thik he ki unaniyon ke aane ke purv ke sanskrit naatak aajkal nahin milte hai, par is baat se inkaa abhaav, itane pramaanon ke rahete, nahin mana ja saktaa
 It is possible, when the Hindu caste has got union with the well-to-do Greek caste, then just as some other things were accepted by each other
 isi prakaar naatak ke sambandh main kuch baaten hinduon ne bhi apane yahan lee hon
 Seeing the 'jawanika' name of the outer layer, some people suggest Yavana connection
 ankon main jo 'drishy' sanskrit naatakon main aae hai unase anumaan hota he ki in paton par chitra bane rahete the
 Astu more and more, it can be said in this subject that in ancient times, there used to be acting
 unamem chitrapat kaam main nahin laae jate the
 He was promoted after Alexander's arrival
 ab bhi ramlila, raasalila bina paradon ke hoti hi hai
 Democracy emerged in the regional languages in the medieval period
 yah vicitra sanyog he ki muslimkaal main jahaan shaskaon kii dharmakattarata ne bharat kii saahitiyik rang-parampara ko tod daalaa vahaan lokbhashaon main lokmanch kaa acha prasar hua
 Lokalharmi Natyamanch continued in the form of Raslila, Ramlila and Nautanki etc
 bhaktikaal main ek ore to braj pradesh main krishna kii raasalilaon kaa brajabhasha main atyadhik prachlan hua or duusari or vijaydashami ke avasar par samooche bharat ke chote-bade nagaron main ramlila badi dhoomdhaam se manaai jane lagi
 Literally, some Sanskrit dramas have also had Hindi chhayanuwad in this medieval period, such as Nevaaz 'abhigyan Shakuntal', Somnath's 'malati-madhav', Hridayaramcharit 'hanumannataka' etc
; Some original compositional interactive works were also done, such as Lachhiram's 'karunabharana', Raghuram Nagar's 'sabhasara', Ganesh poet's work 'pradyumnvijay' etc
; But the dramatic method was not completely maintained in them
 ye keval sanvadatmak rachanaayen hi kahi ja sakati hai
 Thus due to lack of literary vision and literary works, there was no tendency towards literary theater in the medieval period
 sach to yah he ki aadhunik kaal main vyavsaayik tathaa saahitiyik rangamanch ke udai se purv hamaare desh main ramlila, nautanki aadi ke lokmanch ne hi chaar-paanch sau varshon tak hindi rangamanch ko jivit rakhaa
 This folk-tradition is present in the entire country till date
 uttar bharat main ramlilaon ke atirikt mahabharat par aadhaarit ‘vir abhimanyu’, ‘satya harishchandra’ aadi drame tathaa ‘rup-basant’, ‘hir-raanjha’, ‘hakikatraay’, ‘bilwamangal’ aadi nautankiyan aaj tak prachlit hai
 Theater was encouraged in modern times with the establishment of the English state
 falat: samooche bharat main vyavsaayik naatak mandaliyaan sthapit huin
 The trend of Natyarangan first appeared in Bengali
 san 1835 i
 ke aasapaas kalakatta main kai avyavsaayik rangashaalaon kaa nirmaan hua
 Some of Calcutta's elite families and nobles had contributed to the creation of them and on the other hand the commercial drama was different from the unabashed effort of the circles
 banglaa ke is natya-srijan or natyarangan kaa adhyayan isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki bharatendu harishchandr ke rangandolan ko isi se dasha, disha or prerana mili thi
 The plays which were composed in this early literary endeavor of Bengali were the chronicles or adaptations of the original Sanskrit or English plays
 spasht he ki bharatendu kaa aarmabhik prayaas bhi sanskrit naatakon ke chhayanuwaad kaa hi tha
 The first of the Hindi theatrical literary plays can be called 'inder Sabha' in Hindi Geetinatya Amanat which was played in the court of Nawab Wajid Alishah of Lucknow in 1853 AD
 isamen urdu-style kaa vaisaa hi prayog tha jaisaa parsi naatak mandaliyon ne apane naatakon main apanaaya
 a pure Hindi drama called 'janaki Mangal' was played in Kashi in 1862 AD
 uparyukt saahitiyik rangamanch ke uparyukt chhutput prayaas se bahut aage badhkar parsi mandaliyon-original victoria, ampress victoria, elfinston theetrical company, alfred theetrical tathaa new alfred company aadi-ne vyavsaayik rangamanch banaaya
 Firstly, Bombay and later Hyderabad, Lucknow, Banaras, Delhi, Lahore etc
 These companies started wandering all over the country to perform Hindi plays
 in parsi naatak mandaliyon ke liye pehle-pahal nasarbani khan sahab, raunak banarsi, vinayak prasad ‘talib’, ‘ahasan’ aadi lekhakon ne naatak likhe
 The main objective of these companies was cheap entertainment and earning public
 isi se ucchkoti ke saahitiyik naatakon se inkaa vishesh prayojan nahin tha
 She used to show religious-mythological and love-based plays in her theater
 saste or ashleel pradarshan karne main inhen jaraa bhi sankoch nahin tha
 This is to blame for corrupting people's interest
 bhraman ke kaaran in companiyon kaa rangamanch bhi inke saath ghumta rahata tha
 The establishment of a permanent theater was also not possible through him
 rangamanch kaa dhaanchaa balliyon dwaara nirmit kiya jaataa tha or stage par chitra-vicitra parde lataka die jate the
 His attention was paid to flashy costumes, new paintings of curtains and miraculous scenes
 pardon ko drishyon ke anusaar uthaaya-giraaya jaataa tha
 The musical instrument was organized in the next part of the stage
 gambhir drishyon ke bich-bich main bhi bhadde hasyapurna drishy jaanboojhkar rakhe jate the
 Shayari, ghazals and rhymes used to run a lot in between
 bhashaa urdu-hindi kaa mishrit rup thi
 The dialogues were versatile and rhymed
 radheshyaam kathavachak, narayanprasad betaab, aagaahashr kashmiri, harikrishna johar aadi kuch aise naatakkaar bhi hue hai jinhone parsi rangamanch ko kuch saahitiyik put dekar sudhaarney kaa praytn kiya he or hindi ko is vyavsaayik rangamanch par laane kii cheshtaa kii
 But due to professional instinct, improvisation on this theater was not possible
 isi se in naatakakaron ko bhi vyavsaayik ban janaa padaa
 Thus Parsi theater could not develop, nor could it become permanent
 hindi main naatakon kaa prarambh bharatendu harishchandra se mana jaataa he
 Bharatendu and his contemporary playwrights of that period composed plays for the development of public consciousness, so social problems of that time had a good opportunity to be expressed in plays
 jaisaaki kaha ja chukaa he, hindi main avyavsaayik saahitiyik rangamanch ke nirmaan kaa shriganesh aagaahasan ‘amaanat’ lakhanvi ke ‘inder sabha’ naamak geeti-roopak se mana ja saktaa he
 But the truth is that Inder Sabha was not really a theatrical work
 isamen shaamiyane ke neeche khulaa stage rahata tha
 The audience used to sit like a gimmick on three sides, on one side the seat of King Inder was put on the seat, along with chairs for the fairies
 sazindon ke peeche ek laal rang kaa pardaa lataka diya jaataa tha
 Characters were entered from behind it
 raja inder, pariyaan aadi paatr ek baar aakar vahiin upasthit rahete the
 They did not go back by speaking their dialogues
 us samay natyarangan itnaa lokapriy hua ki amaanat kii ‘inder sabha’ ke anukaran par kai sabhaayen rachi gai, jaise ‘madarilal kii inder sabha’, ‘daryai inder sabha’, ‘hawaii inder sabha’ aadi
 Parsi drama circles also adopted these synagogues and Majlisperistan
 ye rachanaayen naatak nahin thi or na hi inase hindi kaa rangamanch nirmit hua
 That is why Bharatendu Harishchandra used to call them 'natakabhas'
 unhone inaki parody ke rup main ‘bandar sabha’ likhi thi
 The era of Sanskrit plays began to change, then from the fourteenth century to the nineteenth century, they were replaced by folk plays in various Indian languages

 The polynomial remainder theorem in algebra is an application of polynomial long division
 is prameya ke anusaar, kisi rekhiy bhaajak x − a { \ displaystyle x-a \ ,} se kisi bahupad f { \ displaystyle f \ ,} ko bhaag karne par shesh r { \ displaystyle r \ ,} kaa maan f { \ displaystyle f} ke baraabar hota he
 Let f = x 3 - 12 x 2 - 42 { \ displaystyle f = x ^ {3} -12x ^ {2} -42 \ ,}
 x − 3 { \ displaystyle x-3 \ ,} se bahupadi bhaag karne par bhagfal x 2 - 9 x - 27 { \ displaystyle x ^ {2} -9x-27 \ ,} and the remainder - 123 { \ displaystyle -123 \ ,}
 or duusari taraf, f = − 123 { \ displaystyle f=-123 \ ,} 
atah f ko se vibhajit karne par shesh = f= -123
 This becomes clear from the definition of polynomial long-haul, because jahaan g { \ displaystyle g \ ,}, q { \ displaystyle q \ ,}, evam r { \ displaystyle r \ ,} kramshah bhaajak, bhajanfal evam shesh hai tathaa r { \ displaystyle r \ ,} kii koti g { \ displaystyle g \ ,} kii degree se kam he
 Now if g = x - a { \ displaystyle g = xa \ ,}, then the degree of the remaining r { \ displaystyle r \ ,} will be zero; That is, r = r { \ displaystyle r = r \ ,} and ab x = a { \ displaystyle x=a \ ! \ ,} rakhane par Itisiddham musandam muhafazah oman kaa ek muhafazah he

 Umar used to participate in the annual wrestling matches

 And wanted to kill Muhammad sahib
 umr shuru main but parasti karte the
 Omar was from a rich family in Mecca, a very brave and courageous person
 umr musalamaanon ko pasand nahin karte the, naa hi mohammad sahab ke mishan ko
 But Prophet Muhammad sahab went to Kabaa one evening and prayed to Allah that Allah should give Umar or Amr Abu Jahl to both of you who are dear to you
 yah dua umr ke haq main qabool hui
 Omar had once set out with the intention of killing the Prophet, a man named Naeem was found on the way who told Omar that his sister and her husband had brought Islam
 umr gusse main aakar bahan ke ghar chal diye
 Both of them were studying Quran at home
 umr unase kuran maangane lage magar unhone manaa kar diya
 Omar became angry and started killing them both
 magar unki bahan ne kaha ham mar jaaenge lekin islam nahin chodenge
 Omar felt ashamed to see the blood dripping from his sister's face and realized the mistake
 kaha ki main kuran padhanaa chahta hoon, isko apamaanit nahin karuunga vaayada kiya
 When Omar read the Quran, he said that it is the declaration of God that no human being can be created
 ek chamatkaar kii tarah se umr kuran ke satya ko grahan kar liya tathaa mohammad sahab se milane gayi
 Muhammad Sahab was very happy when Omar entered Islam
 musalamaanon khushi kii lahar daud gai umr ke islam laane par
 Omar announced that now everyone will study together in the Namaz Kabe, which no one could have imagined earlier
 umr islam ke shatru the parantu ab vah islam ke sarankshak ban gayi
 Seeing Omar in Islam created a furore among Muhammad's enemies
 ab islam ko umr naam kii ek tej talwaar mil gai thi jisase sara makka tharrata tha
 The Meccans hurled their sobs at the weak Muslims, upon which Muhammad sahab prayed to Allah, then Allah ordered him to go to Medina
 saare musalmaan chhupakar madeene kii taraf hizrat yani pravaas karne lage
 But Omar was very courageous, took his sword, took a bow and shot, reached near the Kaaba and did a tawaaf, read two rakat hymns and then said "who wants to make his mother cry on himself, orphan his children and widow his wife
" Meet the place
 " kisi kaa saahas nahin hua ki umr ko roke

 624 i main musalamaanon ko badr kii jang ladanaa padaa jisamen hazarat umr ne bhi aham kirdaar nibhaayaa
 In the battle of Badr, Muslims were defeated and the Musharis of Mecca were defeated
 badr kii jang ke ek saal baad makka vaale ekajute ho kar madeene pe hamalaa karne aa gaye, jang uhud naamak pahari ke paas hui
 In the beginning of the war, the Muslim army was heavy but due to some reasons the Muslims were defeated
 kuch logon ne afvaah uda di ki mohammad sahab shahid kar diye gayi to bahut se muslim ghabara gaye, umr ne bhi talwaar phenk di tathaa kehane lage ab jeena bekaar he
 After some time i came to know that this is a rumor and then stood again

 Omar led the Muslim army and finally Mecca also conquered

 On 8 June 632, Muhammad Sahib said goodbye to the world
 umr tathaa kuch log ye vishwaas hi naa rakhte the ki mohammad sahab kii mutyu bhi ho sakati he
 On hearing this news, Umar lost his senses, took out his sword and started saying loudly that i will separate his head from the person who said that the prophet has died
 is najuk maukey par tabhi hazarat abu bakr ne musalamaanon ko ek khutaba arthath bhaashan diya jo bahut mashhoor he: Then read the verse of the Quran: hazarat abu bakr se sunakar tamaam log gash khaakar gir gayi, umr bhi apane ghutanon ke bal gir gayi tathaa is bahut baden du:kha ko sweekaar kar liya
 When Hazrat Abu Bakr felt that his time was near, he chose Hazrat Umar for the next Khalifa
 umr unki asaadhaaran ichha shakti, buddhi, raajnneetik, nishpakshta, nyaay or garibon or vanchiton logon ke liye dekhbhaal ke liye acchhee tarah se jane jate the
 Hazrat Abu Bakr was fully aware of Omar's power and his ability to succeed
 umr kaa uttaradhikaar is prakaar ke rup main dusron ke kisi bhi rup main pareshaani nahin tha
 Hazrat Abu Bakr wrote his will to Hazrat Usman before his death that Omar would be his successor
 agast, san 634 i main hazarat abu bakr kii mrityu ho gai
 Omar became the Caliph and a new phase began
