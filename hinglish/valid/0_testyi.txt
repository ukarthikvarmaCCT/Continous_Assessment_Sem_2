 Once this caries reaches the dentin of the dentin and enamel, the erosion spreads laterally
 dant-utak ke bheetar, yah ksharan ek tribhuj pattern kaa paalan karata he, jisaki disha daant ke goode kii ore hoti he
 This pattern of corrosion is uniquely described by two triangles whose bases are connected to each other on the DEJ
 chikani sataha par hone vaale ksharan ke vipareet aadhaar-se-aadhaar kaa yah pattern ek gadde va daraar ke ksharan kaa vishisht pattern he
 There are three types of erosion that occur on a smooth surface
 samipsth ksharan, jise antahsamipsth ksharan bhi kaha jaataa he, samipsth daanton ke bich kii chikani sataha par hota he
 Basic caries occurs on the root surfaces of teeth
 chikani sataha par hone vaala tisare prakaar kaa ksharan daant kii kisi bhi anya chikani sataha par hota he
 Proximal caries are the most difficult to identify
 aksar is prakaar ke ksharan kii pahchaan keval dekhakar yaa danta anveshak ke dwaara maanviya rup se nahin kii ja sakati
 samipsth ksharan do daanton ke sampark-sthal ke thik neeche grav rup se nirmit hota he
 As a result, a radiograph is required to identify proximal caries at an early stage
 blake kii vargeekaran pranali main, pichley daanton par utpann samipsth ksharan shrenee II ke ksharan kehalaate hai
 Proximal caries on the front teeth, if not involving the rodent end, is placed in category III and if the rodent end is involved, it is placed in category IV
 mul ksharan, jinka varnan kabhi-kabhi chikani-sataha vaale ksharan ke ek prakaar ke rup main kiya jaataa he, ksharan kaa teesraa sabase aam prakaar hai or ye saamanytah tab utpann hote hai, jab mul satahen masoodon main ghataav ke kaaran ujagar ho gayi hon
 yadi masoode swasth hon, to mul ksharan ke vikaas kii sambhaavna nahin hoti kyonki jeevanvik plak mul satahon tak nahin pahunch saktaa
 dantabalk kii tulana main mul satahen akhanijeekaran prakriya ke prati adhik asurakshit hoti hai kyonki dant-mul 6
7 piech par akhanijeekrut hona prarambh karata he, jo ki dantabalk ke najuk piech se ucch he
 Despite this, it is easier to prevent the development of root caries than enamel erosion because reabsorption of fluoride is greater in the original than enamel
 antahsamipsth satahon kii tulana main, jiheey satahon kii tulana main jihviy satahon par mul ksharan hone kii sambhaavna sabase zyada hoti he
 The jaw teeth on the jaw are the most common place of original caries, followed by the jaw on the jaw, the forearm on the jaw, the posterior position on the jaw and the teeth on the jaw
 daanton kii chikani satahon par chot lag janaa bhi sambhav he
 Since they occur in all areas of the smooth surface except for interconnected areas, it is easy to identify this type of corrosion and is associated with food that encourages plaque and caries formation
 blake ke vargeekaran ke antargat, ananmukheey athwa jiheey satahon ke paas sthit masoodon par hone vaale ksharan ko shrenee v ke rup main chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Category VI is reserved for the ends of the posterior teeth and the rodent ends of the anterior teeth
 purv varnit do shreniyon ke alaava, ksharangrast chot ko ek daant kii kisi vishisht sataha par unki sthiti ke dwaara bhi varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 The erosion that occurs on the surface of the teeth closest to the cheeks or lips is called "caries erosion" and the surface erosion on the side of the tongue is called gingival erosion
 ananmukh ksharan ko aage kapol or oshthak kaha jaataa he
 Obstructive caries is found on the chewing surfaces of the posterior teeth
 krintak ksharan agrastha daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paaya jaataa he
 Erosions can also be described as "moderate" or "remote"
 madhyam ksharan daanton par kisi aise sthaan se sambandhit hote hai, jo chehre kii madhya-rekha ke nikat ho, jo ki ankhon ke bich se neeche naak kii ore or madhya krintakon ke sampark ke bich kii urdhv dhuree par sthit hoti he
 The position of the teeth distal to the midline is described as distal
 kuch udaahranon main, kshayon kaa varnan kisi anya prakaar se bhi kiya jaataa he, jo iske kaaran kii ore suchit karata ho
 "baby bottle erosion", "early childhood caries" or "baby bottle tooth erosion" is a pattern found in young children with temporary teeth
 isamen jabadon ke agr-bhaag par sthit daanton par sabase zyada prabhaav padane kii sambhaavna hoti he, lekin sabhi daant prabhavit ho sakate hai
 This type of caries gets its name based on the fact that this caries usually occurs as a result of allowing infants to sleep with the sweet liquids stored in their bottles, or to feed infants several times a day
 ksharan kaa ek anya pattern “atyadhik failanevaala ksharan " he, jo anek daanton kii kai satahon par hone vaale unnat yaa atyadhik ksharan ko suchit karata he
 Excessive spreading erosion can be seen in people suffering from dry mouth disease, disregard for mouth health, use of stimulants and / or consuming sugar too much
 yadi atyadhik failanevaala ksharan sir va gardan par purvavarti vikiran ke kaaran ho, to iskaa varnan vikiran-prabhavit ksharan ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 These problems can occur due to autoimmune of the original and when new teeth are growing, reconstruction of the entire tooth or later for unknown reasons
 dow miller ne 1887 main kaha ki "danta-ksharan ek rasinic-paraseete prakriya he, jisamen do charan hote hai-dantabalk kaa akhatikaran, jiske parinamswaroop purna vinaash hota he, tathaa praathmik charan ke rup main dant-utak kaa akhatikaran, jiske baad mulaayam ho chukaa avshisht kaa vilyan hota he
 "in his hypothesis, Dr
 Miller assigned the necessary roles to three factors: ksharanon kii pragati kii dar va pichley itihaas kii ore suchit karne ke liye un par asthaayee vivaran lagu kiye ja sakate hai
 "acute" refers to a rapidly developing condition, while "long-term" describes a condition that has taken too long to develop, including thousands of bars of food and breakfast, of which Many cause some acid demineralization, which is not re-mineralized, eventually resulting in pores
 fluoride upachaar daant ke dantabalk punarkhatikaran main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Recurring caries, also known as secondary caries, are caries that occur at a location that has a long history of erosion
 aksar yah bharaai or anya danta prayaavartanon par paaya jaataa he
 Early erosion, on the other hand, is used to describe a decay at a place that has not experienced any decay before
 roka gaya ksharan kisi aise daant par ek chot kaa varnan karata he, jo pehle akhanijeekrut ho gaya ho, lekin jise koi chhidr utapann hone se pehle hi punarkhanijeekrut kar liya gaya ho
 Using fluoride treatment can be helpful in recalibration
 prabhavit hone vaale utakon ke aadhaar par, ksharanon kaa varnan dantabalk, dant-utak yaa dant-mul rakhane vaale ksharanon ke rup main kiya janaa sambhav he
 At the beginning of its development, caries is only possible to affect enamel
 ek baar jab kshay kaa vistaar dant-utak kii gahari parat tak pahunch jaataa he, to “dant-utak ksharan” shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since cementum is a hard tissue covering the roots of teeth, it is generally not affected by caries until the roots of the tooth are exposed in the mouth
 Although the term "dental caries" can be used to describe caries at the roots of teeth, in very rare situations this erosion only affects the tooth root
 jadon main dant-utak kii ek badi parat ke upar cementem kii ek bahut patali parat hoti he or is prakaar dant-mul ko prabhavit karne vaale adhikansh ksharan dant-utak ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 It is possible that a person experiencing erosion may not be aware of it
 ek nae ksharangrast ghaav kaa sabase pehla sanket daant kii sataha par ek khadiamay safed dhabbe ke rup main miltaa he, jo is baat kii ore suchit karata he ki us kshetra main dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran ho rahaa he
 This is called initial decay
 jab ghaav kaa akhanijeekaran jari rahata he, to yah bhure rang main badal saktaa he, lekin antat yah ek kotkh main badal jayega
 chhidr kaa nirmaan hone se pehle, yah prakriya prativerti hoti he, lekin ek baar chhidr kaa nirmaan ho jane par, daant kii nasht ho chuki sanrachana ko punarutpann nahin kiya ja saktaa
 koi aisa ghaav jo bhure rang or chamkila kaa dikhaai detaa ho, yah darshata he ki kisi samay danta ksharan maujuud the, lekin akhanijeekaran kii prakriya ruk gai he or keval ek daag rah gaya he
 a brownish stain that appears to be dull is probably a sign of active corrosion
 jab dantabalk or dant-utak nasht ho jate hai, to yah chhidr lakshaneey ho jaataa he
 The affected areas of the tooth change their color and feel soft on touching
 ek baar jab kshay dantabalk se hokar guzar jaataa he, to daanton kii nalikaayen, jinamein daant kii nason tak jane kaa maarg hota he, ujagar ho jaati hai, jisase daant main dard hone lagata he
 This pain may increase further when exposed to hot, cold or sweet food and drinks
 danta-kshay ke kaaran saanson main badboo or vikrut swaad jaisi samasyaayein bhi ho sakati hai
 In highly developed conditions, tooth infection can also spread to the surrounding soft tissue
 guhamay vivar dhanasrata or ludbig kaa kanthshul jaisi jatiltaaon se jivan ke liye khatra bhi utpann ho saktaa he
 Four main parameters are required for the formation of an erosion: the tooth surface; Caries-causing bacteria; Fermentable carbohydrates; and time
 The caries process has no inevitable consequence and different individuals are sensitive to different categories based on the size of their teeth, oral health habits, and their salivary resistance
 danta ksharan daant kii kisi bhi aisi sataha par ho saktaa he, jo ki munh ke chhidr main ujagar ho rahi ho, lekin yah asthi ke bheetar bachaa lee gai sanrachana par nahin ho saktaa
 There are some specific diseases and deformities affecting the teeth, due to which the risk of erosion can increase in a person
 amelogenesis imperfecta, jo 718 main se 1 or 14,000 main se ek vyakti ke bich hota he, ek aisa rog he, jisamen dantabalk yaa to puri tarah nirmit hi nahin hota yaa aparyaapt maatra main nirmit hota he or daanton se gir saktaa he
 In both cases, the risk of tooth decay may increase because enamel is not able to protect the tooth
 adhikansh vyaktiyon main, danta ksharan kaa praathmik kaaran daanton ko prabhavit karanevaali vikrutiyaan yaa bimaariyaan nahin hotin
 daant ke dantabalk kaa chhiyanbe pratishat bhaag khanijon se milakar bana hota he
 These minerals, especially hydroxyapatite, will become soluble when exposed to acidic environments
 Demineralization of enamel begins at a ph of 5
5
 dantabalk kii tulana main dant-utak va dant-mul main ksharan kaa khatra adhik hota he kyonki unamem khanij kii maatra kam hoti he
 Thus, caries can develop quickly when the root surfaces of a tooth are encountered with gums or other diseases associated with the gums
 haalanki, ek swasth maukhik vaataavaran main bhi daant main danta-ksharan hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 The structure of teeth can affect the likelihood of caries formation
 jahaan daanton ke gahare khaanche adhik sankhya main tathaa atiranjit hote hai, vahaan gaddhon va daraaron ke vikaas kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 Also, if food particles are buried between the teeth, the chances of corrosion increase
 hamaare munh main anek prakaar ke maukhik jeevanu paye jate hai, lekin aisa mana jaataa he ki un jeevanuon kii keval kuch vishisht prajatiyaan hi dant-kshay ke liye uttaradaayi hoti hai, jinamein strepstococas mutans or lactobacili shaamil hai
 Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus, Nocardia spp
 And Streptococcus mutans have a close association with dental caries, especially dental caries
 daaton or masoodon ke aas-paas jeevanu ek chipchipe, malai-jaise rang ke padaarth main jamaa ho jate hai, jise plak kaha jaataa he, jo ek jaev-aavaran ke rup main kaary karata he
 Plaque aggregation at some specific locations is more common than at other locations
 daaton ke bich sampark bindu kii hi tarah charvnak or agracharvanak daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paae jane vaale khaanche bhi sookshmdarsheey avarodhan pradaan karte hai
 Plaque may also collect on the gums
 kisi vyakti ke munh main upasthit jeevanu glucose, fructose or sabase aam taur par sukroj ko kinvan naamak ek glicolitic prakriya ke dwaara lactic amla aadi jaise amlon main parivartit kar dete hai
 If these acids are left in contact with the tooth, they can cause demineralization, which is the process of dissolution of minerals
 haalanki yah prakriya gatij hoti he kyonki yadi laar yaa mouthwash ke dwaara is amla ko niskriy kar diya jaae, to punarkhanijeekaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish can be helpful in remineralization
 yadi akhanijeekaran lambey samay tak jari rahata he, to itani badi maatra main khanij-saamagree kii haani ho sakati he ki shesh rah gaya narm jaev padaarth vighatit ho jaataa he, jisase ek kotor yaa chhidr ban jaataa he
 The effect exerted by such sugars on the development of dental caries is called caries
 yadhyapi sharkara ek baddh glucose va fructose ikai hoti he, lekin vastav main yah glucose or fructose kii samaan maatra ke mishran kii tulana main adhik ksharankari hoti he
 This is because bacteria derive energy from the bond between the glucose and fructose subunits
 enzim dextransukraanez dwaara sukroj ko dexran policecride naamak ek atyadhik chipchipe padaarth main roopantarit karke es
 mutans daant par sthiti jaev-parat se chipka rahata he
 The potential for caries development is also affected by the frequency at which teeth are exposed to caries environments
 bhojan athwa naashte ke baad, munh main upasthit jeevanu sharkara kaa chayapachay karte hai, jiske parinamswaroop piech ko ghataane vaale ek amleey-upotpaada kaa nirmaan hota he
 Over time, ph returns to normal due to the salivary resistance and the dissolved mineral content of the tooth surface
 amleey vaataavaran ke saath hone vaale prayek sampark ke dauraan, daanton kii sataha par upasthit gaiyr-jaivik padaarth kaa kuch bhaag vighatit ho jaataa he or yah do ghanton tak vighatit bana rah saktaa he
 Since there is a risk of tooth erosion during these acidic periods, the development of dental caries is highly dependent on the frequency of acidic contact
 yadi bhojan main upyukt carbohydrate kii paryaapt maatra ho, to yah ksharan prakriya munh main daant ke ugane ke kuch hi dinon ke bheetar prarambh ho sakati he
 Evidence suggests that fluoride treatments slow down this process
 samipsth ksharan ko kisi sthaayee daant ke dantabalk se hokar guzarane main ausatan chaar varshon kaa samay lagata he
 Since the enamel covering the original surface is not as durable as the enamel covering the original head, the original erosion generally increases faster than caries on other surfaces
 mul ksharan par hone vaala yah vikaas or khanijeekaran kii haani dantabalk par hone vaale ksharan kii tulana main 2
5 guna adhik tej hoti he
 In very severe cases, in which oral health is very poor and the amount of fermentable carbohydrate in the food is high, erosion can occur within a few months of tooth eruption due to erosion
 udaahranarth, yadi bachche lagaataar shishu botalon se sharkarayukta peya kaa seven karte hon, to aisa ho saktaa he
 There is a correlation between a decrease in saliva and an increase in corrosion because the immunity of saliva is not present to balance the acidic environment created by certain foods
 As a result, the medical conditions that reduce the amount of saliva produced by the salivary glands, especially the jaw subsystem and the parotid gland, are likely to cause extensive dental caries
 iske udaahranon main szograine syndrome, diabetes melitas, diabetes insipids tathaa sarcidosis shaamil hai
 Antihistamines and antidepressants can also block salivary flow
 utprerak, sarvaadhik kukhyat rup se methilamphetamine, bhi laar ke pravaah ko bahut adhik avaruddh kar dete hai
 The tendency of bad oral health is found in those who abuse the catalysts
 bhaang ke paudhe main paaya jane vaala sakriy rasinic padaarth, tetrahydrokaenabinol, bhi laar ke pravaah ko lagbhag puri tarah roak detaa he or is sthiti ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main “coton mouth " kehete hai
 Together with the excessive intake of sugary drinks and unrefined foods, it greatly increases the extent of caries in the users of cannabis
 iske atirikt, sanyukt rajya america main sabase aamtaur par di jane vaali dawaaon main se tirasth pratishat main inke gyaat dushprabhavon kii suchi main munh ke sookhne kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Radiation treatment of the head and neck can also affect cells located in the salivary gland, increasing the likelihood of caries formation
 tambaakoo kaa prayog kii ksharan ke nirmaan ke jokhim ko badha saktaa he
 Some brands of smokeless tobacco have high sugar levels, increasing the chance of caries
 tambaakoo kaa prayog daanton se sambandhit un bimariyon ke liye ek mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak hota he, jo masoode ko peeche dhakel detii hai
 When the gingiva is attached to the teeth, the root surface becomes more visible in the mouth
 yadi aisa hota he, to mul ksharan ek chintajanak baat hoti he kyonki daanton ko dhankane vaale dant-mul ko amlon dwaara dantabalk kii tulana main adhik saralata ke saath akhanijeekrut kar diya jaataa he
 Currently, there is not enough evidence to support an informal relationship between smoking and spinal caries, but these evidence do point to an association between smoking and root-surface caries
 antargarbhashayi or navjaat shishuon main sise kaa sampark danta kshay ko protsaahit karata he
 In addition to lead, electric charge and all molecules with the same ionic radius of divalent calcium, such as cadmium, mimic calcium ions, and therefore contact with them increases tooth decay
 dantabalk atyadhik khanijeekrut akoshikeey utak hota he or ksharan jeevanuon dwaara prarambh kii jane vaali ek rasinic prakriya ke dwaara ise haani pahunchaate hai
 When these bacteria start consuming sugars and use it for their own energy, then they produce lactic acid
 is prakriya ke prabhaavon main dantabalk main upasthit kanon kaa akhanijeekaran shaamil he, jo ki samay ke bitne ke saath-saath amlon ke kaaran hota he or tab tak jari rahata he, jab tak ki jeevanu shaareerik rup se dant-utak ko bhed na len
 dantabalk kii chaden, jo ki dantabalk kii sanrachana kii moolbhoot ikaiyaan hoti hai, daant kii sataha se dant-utak tak lambavat sthit hoti hai
 Since demineralization of enamel through erosion usually occurs in the direction of enamel rods, different triangular patterns and smooth-surfaced caries develop between the pits and pores in enamel that two areas of tooth enamel rods The situation varies
 jab dantabalk apane khanijon ko kho detaa he or danta ksharan kaa vikaas hone lagata he, to dantabalk main anek spasht kshetra viksit ho jate hai, jinhen ek prakaash sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dekha ja saktaa he
 From the deepest layer of enamel to the enamel surface, the areas identified are: translucent area, black area, body of wound, and surface area
 parbhasi kshetra ksharan kaa pehla drishy sanket hota he or yah khanijon kii ek se do pratishat haani hone par banataa he
 There is little remineralization of enamel in the black zone, which provides an example of how the development of dental caries is an active process with alternating changes
 sarvaadhik akhanijeekaran va vinaash kaa kshetra swatah ghaav kaa mukhya bhaag hi hota he
 The surface area remains relatively mineral-rich and remains present until the tooth structure changes to a pore
 dantabalk ke vipareet, dant-utak danta kshay kii pragati ke prati pratikriya detaa he
 After the creation of the tooth, the aminoblasts that produce enamel are destroyed when the enamel is completed and therefore they cannot be reconstructed after enamel is destroyed
 On the other hand, dentin is produced by the odontoblast throughout its lifespan, which lies between the pulp and dentin
 chunki, odontoblast upasthit hote hai, atah ek utprerak, jaise ksharan, ek jaivik pratikriya ko prarambh kar saktaa he
 These safety procedures include the formation of whiteboard and tertiary dentin
 sabase gahari parat se dantabalk tak sthit dant-utak main, ksharan dwaara prabhavit hone vaale kshetra parbhasi kshetra, vinaash kaa kshetra tathaa jeevanivik chhedan kaa kshetra hai
 The translucent zone represents a moving list of damage processes and is located where the initial demineralization begins
 jeevanvik chhedan tathaa vinaash ke kshetra akramanakari jeevanuon tathaa antat dant-utak ke vighatan ke kshetra hai
 The structure of dentin is an arrangement of microscopic currents, called dentinal tubules, that protrude from the pulp part toward the outer dentin or enamel border
 dant-utak nalikaaon kaa vyas goode ke paas adhik or dant-utak va dantabalk ke sangyojan-sthaan par sabase kam hota he
 The damage process continues throughout the dentin tubules, which are responsible for the triangular pattern resulting from the development of caries deep into the tooth
 nalikaayen ksharanon ko bhi tezi se viksit hone kaa mauka detii hai
 In response, the fluid present in the tubes brings immunoglobulin from our immune system to fight this bacterial infection
 isi samay, aas-paas kii nalikaaon ke khanijeekaran main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he
 This results in the formation of tubules, an attempt to reduce the rate of bacterial progression
 iske atirikt, jab jeevanuon kaa amla hydroxipetic kanon kaa akhanijeekaran karata he, to calcium va phosphorus chode jate hai, jisase adhik sankhya main kanon ke avakshepan kaa mauka miltaa he, jo dant-utak nalikaaon main gahare tak samaa jate hai
 These particles form a barrier and slow the expansion of corrosion
 in rakshaatmak pratikriyaaon ke baad, dant-utak ko shwetapatli mana jaataa he
 It is believed that due to the fluids present inside the tubules of dentin, the pain receptors located inside the tooth pulp become active
 chunki shwetapatli dant-utak aise dravon ke pravaah ko roktaa he, atah sambhav he ki jis dard ne jeevanuon ke akraman kii chetavanee di hoti, vah pehle pahal utpann hi na ho
 As a result, dental caries may continue to progress for a long time without any sensitivity to the tooth, which can lead to great loss of tooth structure
 danta kshay kii pratikriyaswaroop, goode kii disha main or adhik dant-utak kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 This new dentin is referred to as tertiary dentin
 tritiyak dant-utak kaa nirmaan aage bad rahe jeevanuon se goode kii yathasambhav raksha karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 When more tertiary dentin is produced, the size of the pulp decreases
 is prakaar ke dant-utak ko mul odontoblast kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti ke anusaar up-vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 If odontoblasts survive for so long that they can respond to dental caries, the dentin produced in this condition is called "reactive" dentin
 yadi odontoblast nasht ho jate hai, to is sthiti main utpann dant-utak ko “sudhaarak " dant-utak kehete hai
 In the case of rectal dentin, other tissues are required to play the role of destroyed odontoblasts
 aisa mana jaataa he ki vikaas kaarak, visheshtah tijief-beta, goode ke fibroblast or messentimal utakon ke dwaara sudhaarak dant-utak kaa nirmaan prarambh karte hai
 Corrective dentin is developed at an average rate of 1
5 μm / day, but can be increased to 3
5 μm / day
 parinamit dant-utak main aniyamit aakaar vaali dant-utak nalikaayen hoti hai or sambhav he ki ve pehle se maujuud dant-utak nalikaaon ke saath panktibaddh na hon
 yah dant-utak nalikaaon ke bheetar aage bad paane kii danta kshay kii kshamta ko gata detaa he
 The primary diagnosis involves inspecting all visible surfaces of the tooth with the help of a good source of light, dental mirror and investigator
 danta radiograph danta ksharan, visheshtah daanton ke bich sthit ksharan, ko kisi anya prakaar se darshneey hone se purv hi dikhaa saktaa he
 Large dental caries can often be seen with the naked eye, but small lesions can be difficult to detect
 danta-chikitsakon dwaara, vishisht rup se gaddhon va chhidron ke ksharan kaa pataa lagane ke liye, radiograph ke saath hi drishy or sparsh-dwaara nirikshan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Initial, infiltration erosion is often identified by blowing air across the suspect area, which removes moisture and alters the optical characteristics of unmetabolized enamel
 kuch danta anusandhankartaaon ne ksharan kii khoj karne ke liye danta anveshakon kaa prayog na karne kii chetavanee di he
 In situations where a small part of the tooth has started demineralization but has not yet produced a perforation, the pressure from the dental investigator may cause the perforation to form
 chunki, chhidr ke nirmaan se purv kshati kii prakriya ko rokkar lautaaya ja saktaa he, atah fluoride ke saath ksharan ko rokna va daant kii sataha ko punarkhanijeekrut karnaa sambhav ho saktaa he
 When a hole is present, restoration will be required to replace the lost tooth structure
 anek baar, gaddhon va chhidron ke ksharanon kii pahchaan karnaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Bacteria can penetrate enamel to reach dentin, but then the outer surface can be regenerated, especially if fluoride is present
 ye ksharan, jinhen kabhi-kabhi “chhipe hue ksharan ” kaha jaataa he, iske baavjood bhi eks-re radiograph dwaara dekhe ja sakenge, lekin daant kaa drishy pareekshan yah darshayega ki dantabalk avikal he athwa nunatam chhidrit he
 The damaged tooth structure is not completely reconstructed, although remineralization of very small damaged wounds may be possible if hygiene is maintained at its optimum level
 chote ghaavon ke liye, kabhi-kabhi samayik fluoride kaa prayog punarkhanijeekaran ko protsaahit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 For larger wounds, the progression of dental caries can be prevented by treatment
 upachaar kaa lakshya daant kii sanrachana ko banaae rakhana or daant ke or adhik vinaash ko rokna hota he
 Generally, early treatment is less painful and less expensive than late treatment
 asamvedak —sthaneey, nitras oxide "), athwa anya anushansit dawaaen— upachaar ke dauraan yaa iske baad dard ko kam karne athwa upachaar ke dauraan bechaini se raahat dene ke liye aavashyak ho sakati hai
 a dental handpiece is used to remove large parts of the damaged substance from the teeth
 ek chammach ek danta upkaran hota he, jiskaa prayog saavdhaneepurvak ksharan ko nikaalane ke liye kiya jaataa he or kabhi-kabhi iskaa prayog tab kiya jaataa he, jab dant-utak main ho rahaa ksharan goode ke paas tak pahunch jaae
 ek baar ksharan ko hataa diye jane par, daant kii kho chuki sanrachana ko kisi prakaar kii danta punarsthapana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki daant ko punah isaki kaaryaatmakataa va suruchipurna sthiti par waapas laayaa ja sake
 Restorative materials include dental amalgam, composite resin, ceramic and gold
 mishrit raal va chini-mitti ko is prakaar banaaya ja saktaa he ki ve mariz ke daanton ke prakritik rang ke samaan dikhaai den or isaliye jab soundarya ek chintaa kaa vishay ho, to aksar inkaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Mixed restorations are not as strong as dental amalgam or gold; Some dentists consider swarna to be the only recommended restore for the rear teeth, which have too much chewing force
 jab ksharan bahut adhik vyapak ho, to yah sambhav he ki daant kii sanrachana main paryaapt rup se itnaa sthaan na ho ki punarsthapanaatmak padaarth ko daant ke bheetar rakhaa ja sake
 Hence a vertex may be required
 yah punarsthapana ek topi kii tarah dikhaai detii he or ise daant ke shesh bache sheersh ke upar jod diya jaataa he
 The tops are often made of gold, porcelain or metal-ceramic
 kuch vishisht sthitiyon main, daant kii punarsthapana ke liye andodontic upachaar karnaa aavashyak ho saktaa he
 Endodontic treatment, also known as "root canal", is recommended if the pulp in the tooth is destroyed by damage-causing bacteria or due to injury
 During the root canal, the damaged part of the tooth is The pulp of the teeth, including the veins and vascular tissues, is removed
 nalikaaon ko andodontic filon ke auzaaron ke dwaara saaf karke unhen aakaar diya jaataa he, phir saamaanya rup se unhen rabar-jaise padaarth ke dwaara bharaa jaataa he, jise guta parchaa kehete hai
 The tooth is filled and a top can also be added to it
 root kanal ke purna ho jane paar daant ab praan-hin he kyonki yah kisi bhi sajiv utak se rahit he
 Amputation can also be a treatment for tooth erosion
 kshatigrast daant ko hataane kaa nirnay tab liya jaataa he, yadi kshatikaarak prakriya ke kaaran daant itnaa adhik nasht ho chukaa ho ki use prabhavi rup se punarsthapit na kiya ja saktaa ho

 As a result of this chemical action, some undesirable properties come in those substances, which make them unsuitable for general use

 Therefore, the knowledge of the deterioration of substances by automatic oxidation and keeping them safe for more days was known to humans for a long time, although full knowledge of the process of 'automatic oxidation' could be obtained much later

 In the automatic oxidation process, the actuators of the chain are free radicals which are very active
 swat: oxikrut honevaale anu main jo sabase nirbal carbon-hydrogen bandha hota he usee ke tuutane se ye mulak banate hai
 Therefore, the presence of a hydrogen atom easily emitted in this type of material is necessary
 iske atirikt usamen ek dwibandh bhi hona chahie jiske saath muktamulak sanyukt ho sake
 Although oxidation reactions are very important for life, they can also be harmful
 oxikaran abhikriya se muktamulak utpann ho sakate hai, jinke dwaara koshikaon ko kshati pahunchane vaali shrunkhlaa abhikriya aarambh ho jaati he
 Antioxidants themselves are oxidized to these free radicals, which helps to break the chain reaction

 Therefore, there are often antioxidant reducing agents, such as thiol, ascorbic acid or polyphenols, etc

 Oxygen stress is the cause and result of diseases
 pratioxykarakon kaa poorak bhojan ke rup main khub prayog kiya jaataa he
 Antioxidants are most organic compounds, such as aromatic amine, phenol, amino phenol, etc
, which can be easily extracted from hydrogen atoms to transform into free radicals and propagate chain reactions
 pratioxikaarak apana kaary karte samay swat: nasht ho jate hai yaa swat: oxikrut honevaale padaarth inako kramash: nasht kar dete hai
 Some substances like rubber, gasoline and lubricating oils are automatically present in them but they get destroyed during their treatment

 Many aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, are auto-oxidized at a very rapid rate, so antioxidants such as hydroquinone, alphanaphthal, catechol, etc

 Reservoir operation is an important aspect since both Bhakra Dam and Pong Dam projects necessitate their operation in an 'integrated mann3er' to achieve optimal benefits of irrigation and power
 Water stored in the reservoir during the summer and rainy season, after meeting with the irrigation requirements of the partner states, is released in a regulated manner during lean periods, in a fixed schedule of filling period – depletion period for both the reservoirs
 The filling and depletion period for a technical committee of the Bhakra Beas Management Board authorizes the monthly releases appropriately honouring the requirements projected by the partner states
 The operation manuals titled "designer's Criteria for the Operation, Maintenance and Observation" for the Bhakra, Pong & Pando reservoirs, duly updated as required, provide the guiding rules for the efficient integrated operation of the reservoirs
the two reservoirs supply irrigation and drinking water to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chandigarh
 Himachal Pradesh is also provided with drinking water supply
 The water quality standards recorded for the reservoir are: Pong Dam Lake was declared a Ramsar Wetland site on account of its rich waterfowl diversity for conservation and sustainable use of the wetland
 This recognition was based on a proposal formulated by the Himachal State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, Shimla submitted to the Ramsar Bureau, Switzerland through the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India
 The large reservoir and its strategic location in the extreme north-west of the northern plains has attracted migratory birds from the plains of India and Central Asian countries and Siberia
 More than 220 bird species of 54 families have been recorded
 The two-day waterfowl census, which ended on 1st Feb 2015, recorded over 130,000 birds in the Pong Dam Wetlands
 The interception of the migratory birds on their trans-himalayan fly path, during each migration season, has enriched the biodiversity values of the reservoir
 The Pong reservoir and its catchment have the following rich flora and fauna
 The reservoir peripheral land area has mixed perennial and deciduous pine forests on hills
 Eucalyptus trees have also been grown in the area
 The forest growth provides enough sustenance to the migratory birds
 The tree species of the forest area are acacia, jamun, shisham, mango, mulberry, ficus, kachanar, amla and prunus
 a variety of shrubs, grasses and climbers have also been reported
the reservoir seasonal water-level variation between the maximum water level and the minimum draw-down level does not permit growth of much emergent vegetation, but some amount of submerged vegetation has been noticed
 a wide variety of commercially viable fish, 27 species of 5 families, such as mahseer, catla, mirror carp, singhara and others are recorded in the Pong Dam reservoir and its tributaries
 Before the reservoir was built, catfishes, mirror carps and a few coarse fish were the dominant fish fauna in the Beas River
 With the emergence of the reservoir, commercial fishing was encouraged as an important program not only to provide employment to about 1500 fishermen but also to promote the eco-tourism potential
 a planned operation of fish stocking was launched with first introduction of common carp in 1974 and Indian major carps or silver carp in 1976–77
 This resulted in a shift in the catch structure of the reservoir, with carps accounting for 61
8% of the total landings in 1987–88
 The present fish stocks in the reservoir, in the sequence of their abundance are: 1) rohu, Aorichthys seenghala, 2) Labeo calbasu, 3) Tor putitora, 4) Cirrhinus mrigala, 5) Wallago attu, 6) Cyprinus carpio, 7) Labeo dero, 8) Catla catla and 9) Channa sp
the reservoir, unlike other reservoirs in the region, has shown a marked growth in catch of mahseer fish, recording 20% of the total catch during 1999-2000 with the average size of the fish ranging from 1
5–1
7 kigram 
 This is attributed to the change in the Himachal Pradesh Fishing Rules, with an added clause which specifies the minimum catchable size for mahseer as 300–500 mimi or approximately 1
2 kigram 
 That rule is stated to give to each female mahseer to breed at least once before being caught
 Mahseer angling in the Pong Dam reservoir is said to be the only one of its kind in the country
 The reservoir was declared as a bird sanctuary in 1983
 a 5-kilometre belt from the periphery of the lake has been declared as buffer zone for the management of the bird sanctuary
 The national, as well as international, significance of the sanctuary is enhanced because of its waterfowl diversity, which was evidenced by the increase of water fowl species from 39 prior to the reservoir to 54 species at post-reservoir stage
 The number of birds reported, particularly during the winter period of November to March, has steadily increased over the years
 The recent records indicate a water fowl count of 130,000 in 2004 and 142,000 during 2005 migratory birds – a major increase from the average annual count of 18,887 for the period 1988–1995
the main bird species reported are the barheaded geese, Anser indicus, northern lapwing, ruddy shelduck, northern pintail, common teal, spot-billed duck, Eurasian coot, red-necked grebe, black-headed gulls, plovers, black stork, terns, water-fowl and egrets
 The avian habitats in the reservoir area are categorized under the following heads: Around five thousand tourists visit the bird sanctuary during the winter season, and most of them come to watch migratory birds for the first time
 Efforts are being made to encourage eco-tourism to attract more tourists to the reservoir
 The periphery above the water surface area of the reservoir has recorded fauna species such as barking deer, sambar, wild boars, leopards and oriental small-clawed otters
 Bathu Temple:- 7 km from Jawali, a tehsil of Kangra District, there stands a cluster of antique, unique, tall temples which remain dipped in water for eight months: but stand exposed to the human eye only during March to June
 a regional water-sports center has been established in the Pong Dam Reservoir, which offers focused activities such as canoeing, rowing, sailing, and water skiing, apart from swimming
 Training programs are organized in water safety and rescue measures with three-tier water-sports courses: the basic course, intermediate course, and advanced course
 Modern infrastructure facilities have been created with a 75-bed hostel and a 10-suite rest house
 It is said to be the only center of its type in the country

 "similarly, Hall also holds that" the diplomatic agent himself, his personal belongings, and the property he owns as a representative of his lord are tax free
 “ 1928 ke paan american kanvension kii dhara 18 dwaara rajanyikon ko karon se unmukti di gai he
 According to this section, diplomatic officers shall be exempt from taxes in the State from which it is accredited

 Religious places should not be seen from outside that it is a house of worship and the language of worship should be acceptable to the country
 1846 main prasha ke puja grih kii bhashaa itavali nahin hone par pope ne ye nirdesh diya tha ki puja kii bhashaa badali jaye
 An example of control over the use of religious freedom dates back to the time when Philip II did not give this right to religious freedom to the tribesmen of Queen Elizabeth

 According to a report in the New York Times, two US institutions had openly studied the correspondence between Russia and East European communist countries by opening embassy dispatches from 1958 to 1971, using national security as an excuse
 aisa karne ke liye unke paas koi kanoonee ajna nahin thi, parantu rashtriya suraksha ke naam paa yah sab kuch hota rahaa
 This opinion was also confirmed by the Rockefeller Commission

 Nowadays, generally, two types of radiation are distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons located outside the nucleus while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus
 eks-re kii insheel kshamta kii maap ko anaavaran kaha jaataa he: However, the effect of ionizing radiation on matter is much more closely related to the amount of energy deposited in them than the charge produced

 Medical X-rays are an important source of man-made radiation exposure, with a magnitude of 58% in the United States in 1987, but since most radiation exposure is natural, the magnitude of medical X-rays is higher than the total US radiation exposure
 It is only 10 percent

 When electrons hit the target, X-rays are formed by two different atomic processes: isliye ek nalee ke parinami utpaada main nalee ke voltage par shunya tak girane vaala ek satat bramlestrolang varnakram or saath main abhilakshanik rekhaon par kai spike hote hai
 The voltage used in clinical X-ray tubes and thus the highest energy of X-rays is about 20 to 150 kv

 Therefore, a thin metallic sheet, often an aluminum sheet or sheet, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed on the window of the X-ray tube, which filters the low-energy components in the spectrum
 ise beam kaa sakhtikaran kehete hai
 Both of these processes of producing X-rays are very inefficient, their output capacity is only around one percent and, therefore, the electric power that can be entered as input, to produce a usable current of X-rays a high percentage of k is released as waste heat

 To make an image of an X-ray of human or animal bones, short X-rays flutter illuminate the body or part and a radiographic film is placed behind it
 upasthit koi bhi asthiyaan prakaash vidyut prakriyaaon dwaara eks-re ke adhikansh photon ko avashoshit kar leti hai
 This is because bones have a higher electron density than soft tissues
 bvfget X-rays are detected based on various methods
 sabase adhik aam taur par jane jane vaale tareeke - photographic plate, casette main photographic film or durlabh prithvi screen hai
 They are all classified as "image receptors" regardless of the elements involved in the image
 digital computer ke aagaman or digital imaging ke avishkaar se pehle adhikansh radiographic chitra utpann karne ke liye photographic platon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 These paintings were produced entirely on glass plates

 In more recent years, computerized and digital radiography is being used in place of photographic film in medical and dental applications, although film technology is still widely used in industrial radiography processes
 Photographic plates are mostly a matter of history, and the "intensifying screen" that replaces them is also becoming dull in history
 dhaatu chaandi ek gaiyr navikarniya sansaadhan he
 It is thus profitable that it is now being replaced by digital and computerized technology
 jahaan photographic filmon ke liye geeli prasanskaran suvidhaon kii jarurat padati thi, vahiin in nai praudyogikiyon ke liye yah sab jaruri nahin he
 Digital storage of images using these new technologies also saves storage space
 chunki photographic plate, eks-re ke prati samvedansheel hote hai, atah ve chitra ko record karne kaa ek saadhan pradaan karte hai, lekin unhen bahut zyada eks-re anaavaran kii bhi jarurat padati he, isliye intencyfoing screen ko taiyaar kiya gaya
 They provide a much lower volume to the patient, as the screen receives X-rays and increases its intensity, so that it can be recorded on film placed next to the intensifying screen

 Initially, the most common detection methods were based on ionization of gases, such as in the Geiger – Müller counter: a sealed volume, typically a cylinder, with a gas, cylindrical cathode in a mica, polymer or thin metallic window, and a wire is anode; High voltage is passed between the cathode and the anode
 jab ek eks-re photon silinder main pravesh karti he, to yah gaiyr kaa ynikaran karti he or yanon va electronon kaa nirmaan karti he
 In this process, electrons move rapidly towards the anode, leading to further ionization along their trajectory

 Since the number of charge carriers generated will vary with the intensity of the incoming light photon, an electrical method is created that can rapidly convert to a voltage and then into a digital signal, which can be converted into a digital signal by a computer
 Is adapted to produce digital images
 haalanki silicon main utkrisht electronic gun hote hai, lekin phir bhi yah vishesh rup se eks-re ke photon kaa ek acha avasorak nahin he
 For this reason, X-rays first fall on a scintillator made of materials such as gadolinium oxysulfide or cesium iodide

 There are considerable differences in the details of his discovery as Röntgen burned his lab notes at the time of his death, but this may have been the concoction of his biographers: Röntgen, a crux tube and a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide
 With cathode rays attached to it, which they wrapped in a black curboard so that the visible light emitted from the tube interfered Do not
 He saw a misty green glow emanating from the screen at about 1 meter distance
 He felt that some invisible rays from the tube were passing through the cardboard, which caused the curtain to glow
 unhone paaya ki ve unki mej par rakhi kitabon or kaagajon se hokar bhi guzar sakati thi
 Röntgen immediately began systematically investigating these unknown rays
 apni praarambhik khoj ke do maheene baad, unhone apana shodh-patr prakashit kiya
 Röntgen discovered its medical use by looking at a picture of his wife's hand made by X-rays on a photographic plate

 Which then create explosions in space

 The Educational Administration of the Government of India was fully centralized prior to the 1919 Act
 is adhinium se aanshik pradeshik swyta pradaan kii gai or taduparant shiksha pradeshik mantralayon ke adheen ek antarit vishay ban gai
 This awakened the feeling of territoriality along with financial difficulties due to lack of proper coordination
 mahatvapurn vishyon par salaah dene ke liye ek kendriya shiksha salaahkaar mandal kii sthapana 1921 main kii gai, par do varsh uparaant ise bhang kar diya gaya
 But it was re-established in 1935

 The 1935 Act of the Government of India gave states more autonomy and as a result the Indian Education Minister became more empowered

 Solar clock was used to know the time from the direction of the sun
 in ghadiyon kii kaaryastylee or kshamta din ke samay tak simit hoti thi kyonki yah raat ke samay kaam nahin kar paati thim
 Nevertheless, they were first used to know the time in the world
 inhen ghadiyon ko aadhaar banaakar samay bataane vaali anya ghadiyon kaa avishkaar hua tha
 Solar clocks have been used in India since ancient Vedic times
 surya siddhant main saura ghadi dwaara samay maapan ke shuddh tareeke adhyay 3 or 13 main varnit hai
 Early solar clocks worked only in the morning and afternoon
 in ghadiyon kii nirmaan vidhi main ek bade stambh ko ek sire se baandhakar jameen main gaad diya jaataa tha or surya ke ghoomane ke saath-saath jameen par padi stambh kii chaaya se samay kaa anumaan lagaaya jaataa tha
 The shadow of the pillar was the smallest during the mid-day, which showed that the sun is located in the middle of the sky
 pashchimi asia or misr kii sabhyataaon main aisi ghadiyon kaa bahut prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The inventors then produced more types of watches that allowed the time of day to be divided into several strikes, however, the hours were somewhat longer than today
 kai sabhyataaon main rituon ke anusaar saura ghadiyaan samay bataane lagi or kai sthanon par to ve din or raat kii baraabar lambaaiyon jaise durlabh dinon kaa bhi gyaan karaati thim
 Many cultures also have human solar clocks in which a person stands in a fixed place and finds the time from the changing shape of his shadow
 saura ghadiyon ke sahi kaam karne ke liye yah aavashyak hota tha ki unhen sahi sthanon par sthapit kiya jaae
 The sun was in different directions at different times in different places of the world, so clocks had to be set according to the direction of the sun
 iskaa ek tarika yah he ki saura ghadi ko is tarah sthapit kiya jaae ki surya ke thik akaash ke bich main hone par parchaai bilkul sidhi dikhe

 Per sec Revolving chhatrapati shivaji maharaj yaa shivaji raaje bhosle bharat ke raja evam ranneetikaar the jinhone 1674 main pashchim bharat main maratha samrajya kii neenv rakhi
 He fought the Mughal Empire of Aurangzeb for many years
 san 1674 main raigarh main unka rajbhishek hua or chhatrapati bane
 Shivaji provided a qualified and progressive administration with the help of his disciplined army and well organized administrative units
 unhone samar-vidya main anek navachaar kiye tathaa chhapamar yuddh kii nayi style viksit kii
 He revived ancient Hindu political practices and courtesy etiquette and replaced Marathi and Sanskrit with the language of royalty
 bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut se logon ne shivaji ke jeevancharit se prerana lekar bharat kii swatantrata ke liye apana tan, man dhan nyochhavar kar diya
 Today, on the lines of his politics, there is a political aspect called Shiv Sena in Nepal and India
 shivaji maharaj kaa janm 19 farvari 1630 main shivneri durg main hua tha
 Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 in Shivneri fort with the womb of Jijabai, wife of Shahji Bhonsle
 shivneri kaa durg puna se uttar kii taraf junnar nagar ke paas tha
 His childhood was spent under the guidance of his mother Jijau Maa Saheb
 vah sabhi kalaon main maahir the, unhone bachapan main raajnneeti evam yuddh kii shiksha lee thi
 These belonged to the Bhonsle sub-caste who were originally from the Kshatriya Maratha caste
 gagabhatta ke anusaar shivaji kaa vansh mewar ke prasiddh guhil sisodiya vansh se miltaa he
 It is due to Shivaji that the entire Maratha community has got the status of being a Kshatriya
 unke pita apratim shoorveer the or unki duusari patni tukabai mohite thim
 His mother Jijabai Jadhav was an extraordinary genius born in the clan and his father was a powerful feudal
 shivaji maharaj ke charitra par mata-pita kaa bahut prabhaav padaa
 Right from childhood, he began to understand the atmosphere and events of that era
 shaasha varg kii karatuuton par ve jhallaate the or baichaiyn ho jate the
 The flame of freedom was ignited in his child's heart
 unhone kuch swamibhakt saathiyon kaa sanghathan kiya
 As the situation progressed, his resolve to break the shackles of foreign rule became stronger
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa vivaah san 14 may 1640 main saibai nimbalkar ke saath laal mahal, puna main hua tha
 At that time the kingdom of Bijapur was going through a period of mutual struggle and foreign invasion
 aise samrajya ke sultan kii seva karne ke badale unhone maawalon ko bijapur ke kilaaf sangathit karne lage
 Maval Pradesh is connected to the Western Ghats and is some 150 km long and 30 km wide
 ve sangharmpurn jivan vyateet karne ke kaaran kushal yoddha maane jate hai
 Marathas and people of all castes live in this region
 shivaji maharaj in sabhi jati ke logon ko lekar maawalon naam dekar sabhi ko sangathit kiya or unase sampark kar unke pradesh se parichit ho gaye the
 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan
 iske alaava taala, mosmala or raiti ke durg bhi shivaji maharaj ke adheen aa gaye the
 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications
 idhar aurangzeb ke agra laut jane ke baad bijapur ke sultan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee
 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
 The Sultan of Bijapur, taking command himself, withdrew his authority over Panhala, Pawangarh, looted Rajapur and killed the head of Shringargarh
 isi samay karnataka main siddijohar ke vidroh ke kaaran bijapur ke sultan ne shivaji ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Shivaji's father Shahaji acted as a mediator in this treaty
 san 1662 main hui is sandhi ke anusaar shivaji ko bijapur ke sultan dwaara swatantra shaasha kii manyata mili
 According to this treaty, the area ranging from Kalyan in the north to Ponda in the south and from Indapur in the east to Davul in the west came under Shivaji's control
 shivaji kii sena main is samay tak 3 xxrep 4 0 paidal or 1000 ghudsavaar ho gaye the
 After the end of the race to become king in North India, Aurangzeb's attention shifted to the south
 wo shivaji kii badhati prabhutaa se parichit tha or usne shivaji par niyantran rakhane ke udyeshy se apane mamaa shysta khan ko dakshin kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Shaiska Khan took 1,50,000 fos and took control of the fort of Supan and Chakan and reached Poona
 usne 3 saal tak mawal main lutmar ki
 One night Shivaji attacked him with his 350 Mavalos
 shysta to khidki ke raste batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa par use isi kram main apni chaar anguliyon se haath dhonaa padaa
 The sons of Shaista Khan, and forty guards and countless soldiers were slaughtered
 is ghatana ke baad aurangzeb ne shysta ko dakkan ke badale bengal kaa soobedaar bana diya or shahjada muajjam shysta kii jagah lene bheja gaya
 This victory increased Shivaji's reputation
 6 saal shaista khan ne apni 15 xxrep 4 0 fuj lekar raja shivaji kaa pura mulukh jalaakar tabah kar diya tha
 Therefore, Shivaji started looting in the Mughal territories to recover his damages
 surat us samay pashchimi vyapaariyon kaa garh tha or hindustani musalamaanon ke liye haj par jane kaa dwaar
 It was a prosperous city and its port was very important
 shivaji ne chaar hajaar kii sena ke saath 1664 main chah dinon tak surat ke dhanadya vyapaariyon ko lutaa
 They did not rob the common man and then returned
 is ghatana kaa zikr dach tathaa angrejon ne apane lekhon main kiya he
 By that time, European traders had settled in India and other Asian countries
 nadir shah ke bharat par akraman karne tak kisi bhi europea shakti ne bhartiya mughal samrajya par akraman karne kii nahin sochi thi
 Disgusted by the loot of Shivaji in Surat, Aurangzeb appointed Gaiyasuddin Khan as a faujdar of Surat in place of Inayat Khan
 or shahjada muajjam tathaa upasenapati raja jaswant singh kii jagah diler khan or raja jaisingh kii niyukti kii gai
 King Jai Singh attacked Shivaji with the support of Sultan of Bijapur, European powers and small feudatories
 is yuddh main shivaji ko haani hone lagi or haar kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue shivaji ne sandhi kaa prastaav bheja
 According to this treaty in June 1665, Shivaji will give 23 fortifications to the Mughals and thus only 12 fort will be left with him
 in 23 durgon se hone vaali aamadani 4 lakh hun salanaa thi
 The areas of Balaghat and Konkan will be given to Shivaji, but he will have to pay 40 lakh Huns in 13 installments in return
 iske alaava prativarsh 5 lakh hun kaa rajasav bhi ve denge
 Shivaji himself will be free from being in Aurangzeb's court, but his son Shambhaji will have to fight in the Mughal court
 bijapur ke kilaaf shivaji mughalon kaa saath denge
 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it
 sambhaaji ko mathura main ek vishwasi brahman ke yahan chhod shivaji maharaj banaras, gayi, puri hote hue sakushal rajgad pahunch gaye 
 This gave the Marathas a new life

 Orkut was a well-known social network organization on the Internet that was being run by the Google Group
 iskaa naam google samooh ke ek karmchaaree orkut buuccocten ke naam par padaa
 Its service was said to have been invented to help the user make new friends and maintain current relationships

 Orkut was used the most in Brazil followed by India in second place
 orkut 30 sitambar, 2014 se band kar diya gaya
 The largest users of Orkut are in Brazil, United States and India
 sabase zyada upyog karne vaale 18-25 varsh ke log hai
 In August 2007, Google decided that California-based Hosted Orkut would manage and now be fully operated by Google Brazil
 orkut ek saamaajik netwarking website he ki swaamitv he or google ink dwaara sanchalit he seva karne main madad upyogkartaaon ko nae or puraane doston se milane or maujuuda sambandhon ko banaae rakhane ke liye banaaya gaya he

 As of April 2010, 48
0% of Orkut users are from Brazil, followed by India with 39
2% and the United States with 2
2%
 However recently, due to the arrival of other social networking sites, the use of orkut has decreased is
 
 Originally held in California, in August 2008 Google announced that Orkut would be fully managed and operated in Brazil, by Google Brazil, in the city of Belo Horizonte
 Because of this the decision was taken to develop a large Brazilian user base and legal issues
 june 2011 ke rup main, Alexa yatayaat duniya main orkut

 Anyone 18 years old or older may include Orkut
 2003 main, google ke liye saamaajik network Friendster kharid kii peshkash kii, lekin prastaav he ki company dwaara asweekrut kiya gaya tha
 Google then commissioned internal Orkut Büyükkökten to work on a competing independent project
 The result was Orkut
 24 janvari 2004 ko shuru kii gai utpaada samudaay sadsyta aamantran dwaara mul rup se hi tha
 "orkut is unique and fun, because it is an organically growing network of trusted friends that the way we all would be a person at least guaranteed to them
 If you are a member of Orkut, that person joins you You can be invited to know as well
 If you do not know an Orkut member, wait a little and most likely you will soon
 We are you as part of the Orkut community
 Look forward to the area
 
 " During the first year, the United States had the largest user base
 munh ke vachan ke dwaara vibhinn brazilian apnaane or aamantrit adhik mitron ko ek viral blogosphere dwaara chaalit prakriya main, shuru hua
 Shortly thereafter, Brazil began to become popular with a large number of users across the US and Orkut in Brazil
 The Americans then quit the service and started switching to other similar sites such as myspace and Friendster

 Each member can become a fan of any of the friends on their list and can also evaluate whether their friend is 'trustworthy', 'cool', "sexy" on a scale of 1 to 3 and can collect in a percentage
 Terms
 Unlike Facebook, where a member can view only the profile details of the people on their network, Orkut allows someone to visit someone's profile, as long as a potential visitor is on their "ignore List"
 mahatvapurn baat he, prayek sadsy ko bhi unke profil variyataon ko anukulit kar sakate hai jaankaree he ki apane doston or / yaa dusron se apane profil par dikhaai dete hai simit kar sakate hai

 henrik oto warburg germany ke jeevarsayan shastri or shodhakarta the
 His mother's name was Elizabeth Gartner and father's name was Emil Warburg, a physicist at the University of Berlin
 amil ainstin ke mitra the or inhone mex plank ke saath bhi kaam kiya tha
 Otto received a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Berlin in 1906 and a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1911
 iske baad kuch samay ve hidelburg main hi shodh karte rahe
 But in 1913, he was appointed to the prestigious Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan unhone sena main bhi kaam kiya or unhone aayran cross padak praapt kiya
 But Einstein forced him to leave the army and inspired him to invest his talent and precious time in research work for human welfare
 san 1931 main ve wilhem institute ke nirdeshak ke pad se sammanit kiye gayi
 He remained in charge of this institution until his death
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad iskaa naam badal kar mex plank institute rakh diya gaya
 In the early twenties, Dr
 Otto began research on the action of oxygen being carried by living cells
 san 1923 main iske liye unhone ek vishesh dabaav-maapak yantra viksit kiya jise unhone warburg menometer naam diya
 This manometer was also able to measure the speed of oxygen uptake by a thin layer of biological tissue
 unhone shwasan-kriya ko utprerit karne karne vaale tatwon par bahut shodh kii or tabhi oxigen-parivahan anzim cytochrome kii khoj kii, jiske liye unhen 1931 main nobel puraskaar mila
 Otto first reported that a cancer cell receives much less oxygen than a normal cell
 unhone hydrogen cynide or carbon-mono-oxide par bhi shodh kii or bataaya ki ye shwasan-kriya ko baadhit karte hai
 He studied a lot of the sub-components nicotinamide and dehydrogenase enzymes etc
 for biochemical activities
 unhone yah bhi siddh kiya ki cancer koshika ke piech or oxigen upbhog main sidhaa sambandh hota he
 If the ph is high, the oxygen content in the cell will be high
 unhone yah bhi batalaaya ki cancer koshika main lactic acid or carbon-daai-oxide banane ke kaaran piech bahut kam lagbhag 6
0 hota he
 Other topics of his research were electron transport chain in mitochondria, photosynthesis in plants, metabolism of cancer cells etc
 san 1963 ke baad se germany main jirasayan shaastra or aanvik jeevigyaan main acchhee shodh karne vaale vaigyanikon ko oto warburg medal se sammanit kiya jaataa he or 2007 ke baad se 25000 euro kaa nakad puraskaar bhi diya jaataa he
 Receiving this award is considered very honorable for scientists
 dow oto ne 1931 main da metabolism of tumors naamak pustak kaa sampadan kiya or apane shodh kaaryon ko isamen prakashit kiya
 In 1962, he wrote a book called New Methods of Cell Physiology
 inhone 178 shodhpatr bhi prakashit kiye the
 Hans Adolf Krebs, who did research in his laboratory and two other scientists, also received the Nobel Prize
 ve hameshaa adhyayan or maanav seva ko sarvopari maanate the or ve aaajeevan avivaahit rahe
 Dr
 Otto became a little irritable and cynical in the last phase of his life
 ve samajhane lage the ki sari bimaariyaan pradooshit chijen khaane se hi hoti hai, isliye ve bread bhi apane khet main paidaa hue jaivik ganhun kii bani hui khaanaa pasand karte the
 Many times they used to go to the tea to drink in the restaurant, they used to give money but in return they used to take only hot water and used organic tea brought with them
 lindav kaa sanshodhit vyaakhyaan dwaara oto warburg nirdeshak, mex plank institute, koshikeey sanrachana vigyaan
 berlin-dehlem, germany
 English version - Dean Burke, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland
 dean bark dwaara sankshipt vivaran - yah vyaakhyaan 1966 main lindav, germany main hue nobel puraskaar vijetaon ke vaarshik adhiveshan main oto warburg ne diya tha
 He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1931 for the discovery of oxygen-transport enzymes in cellular-respiration and also in 1944 for the discovery of active ingredients for hydrogen-transport enzymes, but it was said to be Otto was a citizen of Jewish origin, so Adolf Hitler did not want him to be given the Nabel Prize
 harvard, oxford or hidelburg aadi vishvavidyalayon ne unhen doctrate va anya oopaadhiyon se sammanit kiya
 He was very interested in life's physics and chemistry
 kisi bhi rog ke mukhya or dwitiyak yaa gaunn kaaran hote hai
 For example, the main cause of plague is germs of plague, while secondary causes are dirt, rats and fleas
 mukhya kaaran se abhipraay yah he ki yah us rog se peedit har rogi main vidyaman hota he
 Similarly, there can be countless secondary causes of cancer
 lekin cancer kaa mukhya kaaran oxigen dwaara saamaanya koshikeey shwasan-kriya kaa baadhit hokar sharkara ke khamirikaran main parivartit ho janaa he
 All the cells in the body respire by oxygen to obtain energy, while the cancer cell obtains energy by fermenting sugars
 sabhi saamaanya koshikaaye darasal vayujeevi hai or cancer koshika aanshik avayujeevi hai jo nimna-stareey ekkosiya jeevon kii bhanti glucose kaa khamir karke jivan vyapan karti he
 This difference between normal and cancer cells is important from the point of view of physical and chemistry
 dehlem institute main shuru se hi cancer par shodh ho rahi thi
 Oxygen-transport enzymes Hydrogen-transport enzymes were discovered here and their chemical structure was closely studied
 yadi yah satya he ki cancer kaa pramukh kaaran oxigen dwaara saamaanya shwasan kriya kaa baadhit hokar khamirikaran main parivartit hona he to bina kisi apwaad ke sabhi cancer koshikaaye khamir dwaara shwasan kriya karengi or saamaanya koshikaaye kabhi bhi khamir dwaara shwasan nahin karengi
 Two American scientists Melmgren and Flenegan proved this by simple experimentation
 unhone chuhon ke rakt main titains ke bijaanu chode, jo oxigen ke abhaav main hi ankurit hokar foot jate he or titains failaane vaale keetanuon ko janm dete hai
 They found that the mice were healthy and had no visible symptoms of tetanus, as there was no place in their body where there was not enough oxygen
 lekin jab cancer se peedit chuhon ke rakt main titains ke bijaanu chode to chuuhe titains rog se grasit ho gayi, kyonki unke sharir main cancer kii gaanthon ke bheetar oxigen kii maatra itani kam thi ki titains ke bijaanu ankurit hokar phute or titains ke keetanu baahar nikle or chuuhe titains rog se grasit ho gayi
 These experiments make it clear that cancer cells are partial anaerobic and normal cells are airborne
 ham yahan ek alag tarah ke prayogon ko samajhane kii kushish karte hai jo cancer main khamirikaran or cancer kii vruddhi-dar ke bich maatraatmak sambandhon ko darshaate hai
 Harold Morris, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, in his experiments, showed different rates of growth in cancerous lumps in mice when differentiated liver carcinogens were released into the blood of mice
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki jahaan kisi chuuhe kii ganthen teen din main bad kar doguni ho gai vahiin kisi anya chuuhe kii gaanth ko do guna hone main 30 din lag gayi
 Dean Burke and Mark Woods 3 of the National Cancer Institute also demonstrated in different hepatomas a graph showing the rate of fermentation and the rate of hepatoma progression
 unhone paaya ki khamir or vruddhi-dar main sidhaa maatraatmak sambandh he
 They observed that as the growth rate of hepatoma increases, fermentation also increases in the same proportion or more rapidly
 dean bark or mark woods ne apane graph ke shunya-bindu kshetra main khamirikaran kii dar itani kam hoti he ki use paaramparik tareekon se naapnaa sambhav nahin he jabaki usee kshetra main gaanth kii nunatam vruddhi-dar aasaani se naapi ja sakati he
 But when they developed more sensitive methods of measuring the fermentation of sugars, it was proved that very slowly growing cancers also leaven sugars
 ab yah to siddh ho gaya he ki sharkara ko khamir karke urja grahan karnaa cancer-koshika kii khaas fitarat he, to aaiye ab yah samajhane kii kushish karen ki kaise ek saamaanya koshika badalakar avayujeevi ban jaati he arthath cancer-koshika main parivartit ho jaati he
 For this we try to understand the experiments done by Gahen, Gaisler and Lorenz of Dehlem Institute
 jab chuuhe ke bhrun kii koshikaon ko ek upyukt madhyam main rakhaa jahaan oxigen kaa str bhi paryaapt to ve oxigen kii maujuudagi main viviya shwasan-kriya karti rahi, vibhajit hoti rahi or khamirikaran bhi nahin hua
 But when the oxygen levels were lowered so much that the pneumatic respiration of the cells began to be partially obstructed, they were transformed into leukemic cancer cells after 48 hours of two-cell division
 or ve avayaviya-shwasan karne lagi
 We then developed an oxygen pressure and fermentation gauge in the dividing embryonic cells, which is clearly shown in the attached diagram
 is vyavastha main hamane dekha ki viviya shwasan 35 pratishat kam karne par koshikaaye cancer-koshikaon main roopaantarit ho gai
 If the pressure of oxygen in the body decreases enough that the pneumatic respiration of the dividing cells is obstructed by 35 percent, then cancer becomes
 isse yah siddh hua ki sharir main viviya shwasan aanshik rup se baadhit hone par cancer-koshikaaye banane lagati hai or khamirikaran dwaara shwasan karne lagati hai
 In the early stages of the development of our earth, the atmosphere was deoxygenated and in the name of life, only organisms respired by indistinguishable monocular yeast existed
 phir arabon varshon baad jab hamaare vaataavaran main oxigen kaa aagaman hua, to ye avibhedit ek-kosiya jeev vibhedit hone lage, viviya shwasan karne lage or is tarah prithvi par vanaspatiyon or jeevajantuon kaa vikaas shuru hua
 But we still see this differentiation in cancer cells
 ham yah bhi dekhte hai ki kai baar vaataavaran main paryaapt oxigen hone par bhi cancer kaa vikaas ho rahaa he, kyonki yaa to vibhajit ho rahi koshikaon tak paryaapt oxigen nahin pahunch rahi he yaa koshikaon main shwasan-anzimes ko utprerit karne vaale sakriy tatv vidyaman nahin hai
 But whatever the situation, in cancer, oxygen-respiration is always interrupted, fermentation occurs and cells begin to differentiate
 cancer koshikaon main vyarth aniyantrit vibhajit hone kii kshamta bachati he or jivan ke liye aavashyak sabhi kaary-kshamtaayen samaapt ho jaati hai
 That is, when respiration is interrupted, cancer is born, then life exists, but it is nothing but a group of directionless cells that are dividing
 ab prashn he ki kyon oxigen bhedan karti he or oxigen kii kami kyon avibhedan karti he? yaa kyon shwasan-kriya bhedan karti he or khamirikaran avibhedan karata he
 While both respiration and fermentation are capable of cell division and if fermentation also had penetrating potential, cancer might not exist on this earth
 is tarah kai prashn hai jinka spashtikaran sambhawatah jeevarsayan shaastra de saktaa he
 Phosphate energy is used in both respiration and fermentation but both have different modes of phosphorylation
 cancer ke sandarbh main dekhen to viviya phosforilation bhedan kar sakane main sakasham he, lekin khamiri phosforilation main yah kshamta nahin he
 From the metabolic pathway of respiration and fermentation, it is clear that there is no difference in metabolism of the two until pyruvic acid is formed
 lekin iske baad donon kaa kriya-path alag-alag bhang se hota he
 In fermentation, pyruvic acid is decomposed by dihydro-nicotinamide in the same chemical reaction to form lactic acid
 jabaki viviya shwasan main piruvik acid oxigen kii upasthiti main kai jatil rasaynic kriyaaon se guzar kar jal or carbon-daai-oxide banaata he
 salient points • khamirikaran kii apeksha shwasan-kriya ko baadhit karnaa aasaan he kyonki shwasan zyada jatil prakriya he
 • When respiration is impaired, cells begin to ferment easily because the same catalytic nicotinamide acts in both functions
 • jab koshika main saamaanya shwasan-kriya baadhit hoti he or khamirikaran uski jagah letaa he, to glucose kaa apghaton hota he or urja kii kami ke kaaran koshika mrity ho jaati he
 Decomposition of glucose means death by fermentation and anaerobic respiration means life by fermentation
 • cancer isiilie hi hota he kyonki shwasan-kriya hi koshikaon ko bhedan kii kshamta detii he, na ki khamirikaran
 In conclusion, i want to say that cancer is no longer a mysterious disease and its main cause is obvious to everyone
 hamen cancer se bachaav kii disha main kaary karnaa chaiye
 After all, how long the greedy multinational institutes associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy will not let the benefits of research on cancer reach the common people and keep confusing them
 shaayad tab tak is sansar main karodon log is rog se marate rahenge
 Warburg's lecture was very interesting
 vigyaan jagat main yah badi krantikari ghatana thi ki shwasan-kriya main oxigen ke mahatv ko pehali baar unhone duniya ke saamne rakhaa tha
 But i am very sorry that he remained completely ignorant of Dr
 Budwig's discovery or kept his eyes closed
 uparokt vyaakhyaan unhone budwig kii mahaan khoj ke 15 varsh baad diya tha
 Dr
 Budwig had discovered the mysterious link, which he had been searching for and always failed
 in dinon dow budwig alsi ke tel or paneer se cancer ke rogiyon kaa safaltaapurvak upachaar kar rahi thi or unhen 90 pratishat safalataa bhi mil rahi thi
 Dr
 Budwig once said that she wanted Dr
 Otto to understand his great discovery of linoleic and linolenic acids and their importance in cellular respiration
 san 1952 main budwig ne apane shodhpatr kai baar dow oto ke paas bheje or unase milane kii ichha jaahir kii, parantu oto ne koi jawaab hi nahi diya
 Budwig had also said sternly about Saint Giorgi in one of his interviews that he had read all my papers, was fully aware of my research work but still about my discovery in his book Electronic Biology and Cancer Did not mention
 13 kul, 12 vartmaan Flockers are birds of megapodius biological ancestry
 yah murgi-jaise mote, madhyamaakar ke megapodidaye jeevvaigyanik kul ke pakshi hote hai
 They extend from Southeast Asia to Australia and the islands of the West Pacific Ocean
 jhandmurgiyaan apane andon par baithkar unhen garam rakhane kii bajaae sadate hue patton va anya vanaspatiyon kii dheri bana lete hai jinamein garmi paidaa hoti he or andon ko garam rakhti he
 The flocking male periodically inspects the pile and removes material from it to keep the temperature controlled
 hazarat shahajalaal anterrashtriya vimaanashetra Hazrat Shahjal International Airport, formerly named Zia International Airport and Dhaka International Airport, is the largest airport in Bangladesh
 yah dhaka shahar main sthit he or yahaan 1980 se prachaalan aarambh hua or puraane tejagaanv airport ke baad yahaan se desh ke sabhi anterrashtriya prachaalan aarambh ho gayi
 It is the home base and hub of all Bangladeshi airlines, including Biman Bangladesh Airlines, GMG Airlines, Regent Airways and United Airways
 yah vimaanashetra 1,981 acre main bana he or desh ke lagbhag 66% anterrashtriya evam antardeshiy aagaman evam prasthaan yahaan se hi sampann hote hai
 After this, the second major airport in the country is Shah Amanat International Airport, located in Chittagong, which carries 21% of the passenger number
 dhaka vimaanashetra se vaarshik lagbhag 40 lakh anterrashtriya evam 20 lakh antardeshiy yatri tathaa 1,50,000 ton maal yatayaat sampann hota he
 The passenger capacity of this airport is 80 lakh passengers per annum, and enough has been approved by CAAB for 2026
