 asthisushirta yaa osteoporosis haddi kaa ek rog he jisase fracture kaa khatara bad jaataa he
 In osteoporosis, bone mineral density is reduced, bone micro-structures are disintegrated, and the amount and variety of non-stored proteins in bone is altered

 Osteoporosis is most common in post-menopausal women, when it is called post-menopausal osteoporosis, but it can also develop in men and can be caused by specific hormonal disorders and other chronic illnesses in anyone or drugs, especially glucocorticoids
 Can result when the disease is steroid or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporos Number called

 Exercises to stretch walking muscles, tissue-sensory-correction exercises, in fall prevention advice; Balance therapy may be included
 vyaayaam, apane upachayi prabhaav ke saath, osteoporosis ko usee samay band yaa ulat saktaa he
 In all cases of osteoporosis, the underlying system is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation

 asthishoshak koshikaon dwaara asthi kaa avasorana hota he, jiske baad nai asthi asthikorak koshikaon dwaara jamaa kii jaati he
 The three major mechanisms by which bone weakness develops are insufficient head bone mass, excessive bone absorption, and insufficient formation of new bone during regeneration
 At the core of delicate bone tissue development is the interaction of these three mechanisms
 Hormonal factors specifically determine the rate of bone absorption; Estrogen deficiency increases bone resorption and, at the same time, reduces the deposition of new bone, usually in weight-bearing bones
 is prakriya ko dabaane ke liye apekshit estrogen kii maatra, aam taur par garbhashay or stan granthi ko uttejit karne ke liye apekshit maatra se kam he
 The estrogen receptor of the α-form seems to be very important in the regulation of bone manipulation

 The role of calcitonin, a hormone produced by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as important as PTH
 asthishoshkon ke sakriyakaran vibhinn aanvik sanketon dwaara niyantrit hai, jinamein se RANKL par sarvaadhik adhyayan kiya gaya he

 RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors
 Wnt sanketan maarg kii bhoomika ko sweekruti mili he, par acchhee tarah se kam samajha gaya he
 Local production of eicosanoids and interleukin is thought to be involved in controlling bone manipulation and may be the over or under-production factor of these mediators at the core of the development of osteoporosis
 bandhakmay asthi, lambii asthiyon or kasheruk ke chor par sthit spanjanuma asthi he
 The vulvascular bone is the rigid outer shell of the bones and the middle of the long bones
 kyonki asthikorak or asthishoshak, haddiyon kii sataha par nivas karte hai, bandhakmay asthi zyaada sakriy he or asthi ke her-pher or punarpratirupan ke adheen he
 Not only is bone density low, but bone micro-structures are disrupted
 bandhakmay asthi kamazor conticaayen bhang ho jaati hai or kamazor haddiyon se pratisthapit hoti hai
 Common osteoporotic fracture sites, such as the wrist, hip and spinal cord, have a relatively high ratio of vulvar bone to ligamentous bone
 ye sthal shakti ke liye bandhakmay asthi par ashrith hai or isliye jab punarpratirupan asantulit ho, to teevr punarpratirupan se in jagahon kaa apkshay hota he
 Osteoporosis has no specific symptoms of its own; The main consequence of this is the increased risk of fractures
 osteoporotic fracture un sthitiyon main hote hai, jahaan aam taur par swasth logon kii haddi nahin tuutati he; atah unhen najuk asthi-bhang mana jaataa hai
 Typical delicate fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip, and wrist

 girane kaa khatara, kramshah, kisi bhi kaaran se durbal nazaren, santulan vikaar, gatishiltaa vikaar, manobhransh, or sarcopinia se bad jaataa he
 Fall significantly leads to the risk of falls; The causes of syncope are manifold, but may include cardiac arrhythmias, neuro-cardiac syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and seizures
 awasaiya parivesh main baadhaon or dhili kalinon ko hataaya jane se girnaa kaaphi kam ho saktaa he
 Those who have fallen earlier and whose balance or balance is disturbed, they are most prone to fall
 osteoporotic fracture ke liye jokhim karkon ko gair-parivartaneey or parivartaneey ke bich vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, there are specific diseases and disorders in which osteoporosis is an accepted problem
 dawa kaa prayog saidhantik rup se parivartaneey he, haalanki kai maamalon main osteoporosis ke jokhim ko badhaane vaali dawaaon kaa upyog aprihaary he
 The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age and female gender; Estrogen deficiency after menopause correlates with a rapid decrease in bone mineral density, whereas a decrease in testosterone levels in men has a comparable effect
 haalanki osteoporosis sabhi jaateey samoohon ke logon main paaya jaataa he, europea yaa asian mul ke log osteoporosis ke prati pehle se hi pravrutt hai
 People who have a family history of fractures or osteoporosis are at greater risk; The heritability of fractures and low bone mineral density is relatively high, with an expansion ranging from 25 to 80 percent
 osteoporosis ke vikaas se jude kam se kam 30 jin maujuud hai
 People who have already had a fracture are twice as likely to have a fracture again than someone who is same or gay
 haddiyon kii kamajori ke saath kai bimariyon or vikaron ko sambhddha kiya gaya he
 Some believe the underlying mechanism affecting bone metabolism is straightforward, while for others, the causes are many and unknown
 kuch dawaaon ko osteoporosis jokhim main vruddhi se joda gaya he; pratishthit rup se keval steroid or aksheparodhi jude hai, lekin duusari dawaaon ke sambandh main bhi saboot ubhar rahe hai
 Osteoporosis is diagnosed by measuring bone mineral density
 dohari urja eks-re avasoranamapi sarvaadhik prachlit vidhi he
 In addition to detecting abnormal BMD, a diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigation into potentially variable underlying causes; This can be done with blood tests and X-rays
 mul samasya kii sambhaavna ke aadhaar par, haddi ke vikshepan ke saath bahu-majjarbud, kushing rog or upar ullikhit anya karkon sahit cancer kii jaanch kii ja sakati he
 Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis
 osteoporosis kaa nidaan tab hota he, jab asthi khanij ghanatv yuva vayask sandarbh aabaadi ke 2

 This is called a T-score
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne nimnlikhit disha-nirdeshon ko sthapit kiya he: The term "severe or established" osteoporosis is used when there is also osteoporotic fracture, which is defined as a fall from a steep elevation
 naidanik ghanatvamaapi antarrashtriya samiti kii manyata he ki 50 varsh se kam umr ke purushon main osteoporosis kaa nidaan akele ghanatvamaapan mandandon ke aadhaar par nahin kiya janaa chahie

 In 2002, the US Prevention Services Task Force recommended that all women 65 years of age or older should be tested by densityimeter
 The task force recommends testing only women aged between 60 and 64, who are at greater risk
 vardhit jokhim ko suchit karne vaala uttam jokhim kaarak sharir kaa kam vazan he, jahaan dhumrapaan yaa paariwarik itihaas ke kam saboot hai

 Many drugs are used to treat osteoporosis on the basis of gender
 jivan-style main parivartan bhi upachaar kaa ek pahalu he
 Bisphosphonate is the main medicinal remedy for treatment
 baharhaal, 1990 ke dashak main terriparatide or stronsium rinlate jaisi nai dawaaen prakat huin
 In the case of confirmed osteoporosis, bisphosphonate drugs have been the first in the treatment-preference order of women

 a 2007 manufacturer-supported study reported that in patients with low-impact hip fractures, the annual transfusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid increased the risk of any fracture by 35%, the risk of vertebral fracture from 3
8% to 1
7%
 And reduced the risk of non-vertebral fractures from 10
7% to 7

9 varshon ke baad mrityu-laabh kaa bhi pataa laga: adhyayan samooh ke 9

 Oral bisphosphonates are relatively poorly absorbed and therefore should be taken on an empty stomach, where no food or drink is taken for the next 30 minutes
 It is associated with inflammation of the esophagus and is therefore sometimes tolerated; a weekly or monthly dose reduces the likelihood of esophagitis and is now standardized
 haalanki zolandronet jaise antahshira nuskhon ke saath aantrayik khuraaq maukhik sahishnutaa kii samasyaon kaa parihaar hota he, lekin ye kaarak jabade kaa asthigalan naamak ek durlabh lekin apriy mukh-rog main pradhan rup se antargrast hai
 For this reason, oral bisphosphonate therapy should probably be preferred and now doctors recommend that any curative dental work be done before treatment
 haal hi main, terriparatide ko osteoporosis ke prati prabhavi hona paaya gaya he
 It acts as a parathyroid hormone and stimulates osteoblasts and thus increases their activity
 yah zyaadaatar haddiyon kii kamazori se pusht rogiyon ke liye, visheshtah kam BMD yaa kai fracture ke jokhim kaarak vaale yaa jo maukhik biophasphonet bardaasht nahin kar sakate, istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is given as a daily injection with the use of an injection device such as a pen
 kuch deshon main, terriparatide ko upachaar ke liye tabhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, yadi biophasphonet asafal ho jate hai yaa nishiddh hai
 Patients or young patients with prior radiation therapy or Paget's disease should avoid this medicine

 The Solomon Islands monarchy is the constitutional monarchy of the Solomon Islands
 jamaiki ekadhidaruk ko solomon dweep or united kingdom samet kul 15 prajabhumiyon, kaa sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler has been Queen Elizabeth II since 6 February 1952
 anya rashtramandal deshon ke saamaan hi solomon dweep kii raajnneetik vyavastha westminster pranali par aadhaarit he, jisamen rashtrapramukh kaa pad nammaatr hota he, or vaastavik prashasnic shaktiyaan shashanpramukh par nihit hote hai
 The Solomon Islands are theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of the Solomon Islands is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all the constitutional powers of the ruler, as his representative, the governor-general of the Solomon Islands
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " solomon dweep kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " solomon dweep ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in Solomon Islands lies in British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world
 dhire-dhire in upniveshon ko apni prashasan par samprabhutaa pradaan kar di gai, or westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara in saare rajyon ko rashtramandal ke andar, purnatah samaan pad de diya gaya tha
 Those countries which considered the former colony, the British ruler, as their ruler even today, are called Commonwealth of Nations or Commonwealth Territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhitvatmak kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The relationship between the Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 The rules related to succession can be changed only by the Parliamentary Act, which is mandatory to be passed with the approval of all subjects
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 No successor of Singhasana can voluntarily renounce his succession
 solomon dweep kii sarkaar samprabhu, rajpariwaar yaa desh ke baahar sthit shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav ke samarthan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii aarthik sahaayta nahin pradaan karti he
 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general
 jabaki rajnatik-shaktiyon kaa abhyay governor-general dwaara sarkaar or apane mantriyon kii salaah or vinirdeshon par hi karte hai

 Cheetabagad is a village in Bageshwar district of Kumaon division under Uttarakhand state of India in Kapkot tehsil
 paribhaashik shabdaawalee yaa paribhaasha kosh, "glassri" kaa pratishbd he
 "glassery" is basically derived from the word "gloss"
 "glos" greek bhashaa kaa glossa he jiskaa praarambhik arth "vaani" tha
 Later it became a sign of "language" or "dialect"
 aage chalakar isamen or bhi arthparivartan hue or iskaa prayog kisi bhi prakaar ke shabd ke liye hone laga
 The collection of such words is "glossary" or "definition Dictionary"
 gyaan kii kisi vishesh vidha main prayog kiye jane vaale shabdon kii unki paribhaasha sahit suchi paribhaashik shabdaawalee yaa paribhaashik shabdkosh kehalaati he
 For example, the words and their definitions in the study of mathematics are called the terminology of mathematics
 paribhaashik shabdon kaa prayog jatil vichaaron kii abhivyakti ko sucharu banaata he
 Mahaviracharya has said in the first chapter of 'mathewasarasangraha' called 'cognates': iske baad unhone lambaai, kshetrafal, aaytan, samay, sona, chaandi evam anya dhaatuon ke maapan kii ikaayiyon ke naam or unki paribhaasha diya he
 After this, names and definitions of mathematical operations are given and other mathematical definitions are given
 dwibhashik shabdaawalee main ek bhashaa ke shabdon kaa duusari bhashaa main samanarthak shabd diya jaataa he va us shabd kii paribhaasha bhi kii jaati he
 In terms of meaning, the vocabulary of a language is of two types - general vocabulary and terminology
 aise shabd jo kisi vishesh gyaan ke kshetra main ek nishchit arth main prayukt hote hai, vah paribhaashik shabd hote hai or jo shabd ek nishchit arth main prayukt nahin hote vah saamaanya shabd hote hai
 Famous scholar Acharya Raghuveer explains the difference between technical and simple words in very simple words - paribhaashik shabdon ko spasht karne ke liye anek vidwaanon ne anek prakaar se paribhaashaayen nishchit karne kaa praytn kiya he
 According to Dr
 Raghuveer Singh - dow bholanath tiwari 'anuwaad' ke sampadakeey main ise or spasht karte hue kehete hai- The tradition of terminology is believed to be from Philatus in "encyclopaedia Britannica" and elsewhere
 inkaa kaal teesri sadi i

 he
 He stored the terminology titled "atakta"
 kintu vastut: shabdaawalee kaa itihaas ab bahut peeche chalaa gaya he or ab tak praapt pracheenatam shabdaawalee hittit bhashaa kii he, jiskaa samay isa se praaia: 1000 varsh purv se bhi aage hai
 The oldest terminology in India is found in Nighuntu form
 sanskrit bhashaa main vikaas ke kaaran jab vaidic sanskrit logon ke liye duruh siddh hone lagi to vaidic shabdon ke sangrah kiye gaye, jinhen "nighantu" kii sangya di gai
 The Nighantu available today is that of Yasakacharya, but there is ample evidence of the belief that there were 4-5 more such Nighantu in Yask's time
 yask kaa samay 8veen sadi i
 pus
 mana gaya he
 This means that the term that Western scholars consider Philatus to be the oldest is at least 4-5 hundred years later than Indian nineteenths
 europe main jo shabdaawaliyaan prarambh main sangruhit kii gayi, ekabhashik thim kintu baad main bahubhashik shabdaawaliyon kii parampara chali
 The oldest known bilingual terminology in Europe is of Latingreek, whose collectors have been considered philoxenes, although it has been proven that this work was not originally theirs
 iskaa kaal mote rup se chhathi sadi i
 he
 It is mentioned that in the Encyclopडियाdia Britannica etc
 it is considered to be the oldest multilingual vocabulary, but in fact the Hittite terminology mentioned backwards is trilingual, not only bilingual
 is prakaar pracheenatam bahubhashik shabdaawalee kaa kaal latin-greek se lagbhag dedh hajaar varsh peeche he
 greek-latin latin-greek vocabulary was formed around 1000 AD
 bharat main bahubhashik shabdaawalee kii parampara bahut puraani nahin he
 The former of the Amarkosh - such as Katya's "namamala", Bhaguri's "trikand", Amaradatta's "amarmala" or Vachaspati's "shabarnava" etc
 - and the latter - Purushottam Dev's "harvali" and "trikandakosh", Halayudh's "abhidhana Ratnamala" "yadavprakash's" Vyjanti "etc
 are monolingual
 praakrit apbhransh - jaise dhanpalkrit "pand lachchhinammala", hemchandra kii "deshinammala" tathaa gopal, dron aadi ke deshi "kosh" evam hindi ke puraane kosh - jaise nandadaas, banarsidas, badridaas, haricharandas, chetanvijay, vinayasagar aadi kii "nammala", prayagdas kii "shabdaratnavali" yaa haricharandas kaa "karnabharan" aadi-usee parampara main, arthath ekabhashik shabdaawaliyaan hai
 Perhaps the last book in this tradition is the "umravakosh" of Suvansh Shukla
 bharat main ekaadhik bhashaaon kii shabdaawaliyon kii parampara musalamaanon se aarambh hoti he
 Its most famous book is "khalikbari", which contains Hindi, Farsi, Turkish words
 khalikabaari parampara main is prakaar ke kai granth likhe gaye, jinamein sabase prasiddh rachana amir khusron kii kahi jaati he, yadhyapi is sambandh main paryaapt vivaad he
 According to many scholars, Khalikbari is the creation of a "khusroshah", which was much later than the famous poet Khusro
 shivaji ne bhi raajnneeti kii farsi-sanskrit shabdaawalee banaai thi, jisamen lagbhag 1500 shabd the
 After that, many hindi-persian dictionaries were written in the Khalikbari tradition

 It is noted that despite this tradition, these lexicons are outside the range of terminology
 ab bahubhashik shabdaawaliyon kii parampara bahut viksit ho gai he tathaa idhar 3-4 se lekar 10-12 bhashaaon kii vibhinn vishyon kii shabdaawaliyaan prakashit hui hai
 In this direction, England, USA, Germany, France and Russia have done enough labor
 sanyukt raashtra sangh ne bhi is disha main yoga diya he
 There is no doubt that the vocabulary has developed in the form of shells, but the two are not one
 donon main antar yah he ki shabdaawalee main ek yaa adhik bhashaaon ke shabdon kaa sangrah rahata he, kintu kosh main shabdon kaa arth yaa unki vyakhya aadi bhi rahati he
 Apart from bilingual or multilingual dictionaries of various disciplines in the arts, commerce, science, etc
, synonyms and antonyms also fall under the same vocabulary
 madhyayugin hindi sahitya kaa "nammala" sahitya is drushti se ullekhya he
 Now the tradition of synonyms has become very scientific and they have proved very useful for writers etc

 This dictionary was actually Sagar, which would be considered the best in giving connotations full of words, meanings, idioms, proverbs, examples and quotes
 After this, with the efforts of Acharya Ramchandra Varma, who had long-term experience in Kosh Kala, 'authentic Hindi Dictionary' was published from Varanasi
 'vrihad hindi kosh' ke tisare sanskaran main ek lakh adtalis hazaar shabd hai
 Meanwhile, a new revised and enhanced edition of 'hindi Shabdasagar' was published in which the total page no
