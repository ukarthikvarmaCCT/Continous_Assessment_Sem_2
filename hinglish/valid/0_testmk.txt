 antatogatva uskaa bhimsen ke saath yuddh hua
 He slaughtered many soldiers etc
 on foot of Pandavas and attacked Bhimsen
 us samay gada se prahaar karte hue duryodhana ke anya chote bhai bhi bhimsen ke hi haath se maare gayi apane raja duryodhana kii aisi dasha dekhakar or apane pita dronacharya kii mrityu kaa samaran kar ashwatthama adheer ho gaya
 Concealed, he reached the Pandavas' camp and killed the remaining brave heroes of the Pandavas with the help of Kripacharya and Kritavarma in the fierce Kalratri
 keval yahi nahin, usne pandavon ke paanchon putron ke sir bhi ashwatthama ne kaat daale
 Everybody condemned this misdeed of Ashwatthama and even Duryodhana did not like it
 putron ke hatya se dukhi draupadi vilaap karne lagi
 Hearing his moan, Arjun vowed to cut off the head of the evil karma killer Brahmin
 arjuna kii pratigya sun ashwatthama bhaag niklaa
 Arjuna followed him by making Shri Krishna a charioteer and taking his Gandiva bow
 ashwatthama ko kahin bhi suraksha nahin mili to bhay ke kaaran usne arjuna par brahmastra kaa prayog kar diya
 Ashwatthama knew to operate Brahmastra but did not know to return it
 us ati prachand tejomay agni ko apni ore aata dekh arjuna ne shrikrishna se vinati kii, “he janardan! aap hi is trigunamayi shrrishti ko rachane vaale parameshwar hai
 At the end of the beginning and the last you remain
 aap hi apane bhaktajanon kii raksha ke liye avatar grahan karte hai
 You are the creation of Brahma Swarup, you follow the form of Vishnu and you are the destiny of Rudra Swaroop
 aap hi bataaiye ki yah prachand agni meri ore kahan se aa rahi he or isse meri raksha kaise hogi?” Sri Krishna said, "arjun! Distressed by your fear, Ashwatthama has left this Brahmastra on you
 is brahmastra se tumhaare praan ghor sankat main he
 That Ashwatthama knows its use but is unaware of its prevention
 isse bachane ke liye tumhen bhi apane brahmastra kaa prayog karnaa hoga kyon ki anya kisi astr se iskaa nivaaran nahin ho saktaa
 " shrikrishna kii is mantranaa ko sunakar maharathi arjuna ne bhi tatkaal aachman karke apana brahmastra chhod diya
 The two Brahmastras clashed together and a fierce fire arose and heated the three worlds
 unki lapaton se sari praja dagdh hone lagi
 Seeing this destruction, Arjuna returned and pacified both Brahmastras and pacified Ashwatthama and tied him
 shrikrishna bole, “he arjuna! dharmatma, soye huye, asaavdhaan, matvaale, pagal, agyani, rathhin, stri tathaa balak ko maarna dharm ke anusaar varjit he
 It has behaved against religion, killing sleeping innocent children
 jivit rahegaa to punah paap karegaa
 So immediately fulfill your vow by slaughtering it and placing its severed head in front of Draupadi
 ” Even after hearing these words of Shri Krishna, Dhirwan Arjuna took pity on Guruputra and took Ashwatthama alive in the camp and presented him before Draupadi
 pashu kii tarah bandhe huye guruputr ko dekh kar mamtamayi draupadi kaa komal hriday pigal gaya
 He saluted Guruputra and asked Arjuna to release him, “O Aryaputra! These are Guruputras and Brahmins
 brahman sadaa poojaneey hota he or uski hatya karnaa paap he
 You, your father, have gained knowledge of these unique weapons
 putr ke rup main acharya dron hi aapke sammukh bandi rup main khadey hai
 By killing them, their mother Krupi would be like me, mourning and mourning her son
 putr se vishesh moh hone ke kaaran hi vah dronacharya ke saath sati nahin hui
 Kripi's soul will continue to curse me
 inke vadh karne se mere mrit putr laut kar to nahin aa sakate! atah aap inhen mukt kar dijiye
 " draupadi ke in nyaay tathaa dharmayukt vachanon ko sun kar sabhi ne uski prashansa kii kintu bhim kaa krodh shant nahin hua
 On this Sri Krishna said, "O Arjuna! According to the scriptures, slaughter of impure Brahmin is also a sin and not punishing the terrorist is also a sin
 atah tum vahi karo jo uchit he
 "realizing his point, Arjun cut Ashwatthama's head with his sword and took out the gem of his forehead
 mani nikal jane se vah shrihin ho gaya
 He was dead at the same moment when he had killed the boys but due to the shaving of the hair and leaving the gem, he became even more Mr
less and bowed his head
 arjuna ne use usee apamaanit avasthaa main shivi se baahar nikaal diya
 After insulting Ashwatthama and expelling him from the camp, all the Pandavas went ahead to Dhritarashtra and Shrikrishna Chandra along with all the women of their dynasty to the Ganges coast in order to provide water to their relatives
 striyaan kurri kii bhanti vilaap karti hui gayi, unke shok se vyakul hokar dharmraj yudhisthir ati dukhi huye
 dhritarashtra, gandhari, kunti or draupadi sabhi apane putron, pautron tathaa swajanon ke liye shok karne lageen
 unke shok ke shaman ke liye shrikrishna ne dhaumy tathaa vedavyas aadi muniyon ke saath un sab ko anek prakaar kii yuktiyon se drushtaant dekar santvaana di or samajhaayaa ki yah sansar nashwan he
 The death of the one who is born is certain, all are subject to time, death eats all
 atah mare huye logon ke liye shok karnaa vyarth heswajanon ko jaldaan karne ke baad ajatshatru dharmraj yudhisthir ko hastinapur kaa raja banaaya gaya or unke dwaara teen ashwamegh yajna karawaaye gayi is prakaar yudhisthir kaa shubhr yash teenon lokon main fail gaya kuch kaal ke baad shrikrishna ne dwarika jane kaa vichaar kiya or pandavon se vidaa le kar tathaa vedavyas aadi muniyon kii ajna le kar rath main baith kar saatyaki tathaa uddhav ke saath dwarika jane ke liye prastut huye
 usee samay ek apurv ghatana hui
 He saw that his bride Uttara said in a distraught voice, "save me!" Save me !! protect me! You are yog-yogeshwar
 devataaon ke bhi devtaa hai
 Is the protector of the world
 aap sarv shaktimaan hai
 See this, the ignited iron arrow does not destroy my womb
 he prabho! aap hi meri raksha karne main samarth hai
 Hearing such a bitter word, Shri Krishna immediately jumped from the chariot and said that Ashwatthama used Brahmastra again to destroy the Pandava dynasty, which caused Uttara's womb to burn very much, but Shri Krishna revived the baby with his tenacity
 
 jab dharmraj yudhisthir laut kar aaye or putr janm kaa samachar suna to ve ati prasann huye or unhone asankhyon gau, gaanv, hathi, ghode, ann aadi brahmanon ko daan diye
 Called the best astrologers and asked questions about the future of the child

 One will renounce the illusion of the world before death by the Takshak with the curse of a sage and attain enlightenment from Shri Shukdev Ji on the banks of the Ganges
 dharmraj yudhisthir jyotishiyon ke dwaara bataaye gayi bhavishyafal ko sun kar prasann huye or unhen yathochit dakshina de kar vidaa kiya
 That child started growing day by day like the moon of Shukla Paksha
 unheen dinon dharmraj yudhisthir ne raja marut kaa gada hua dhan laakar ashwamegh yajna kiya
 Under the supervision of Lord Shri Krishna Chandra, the yagna was performed smoothly
 kritavarma, kripacharya tathaa ashwatthama- ye teen kauravapaksheeya vir us sangram se jivit bache
 On the other hand, five Pandavas, Satyakis and Lord Krishna - only seven could survive; No one else was left
 us samay sab ore anath striyon kaa aartnaad vyaapt ho rahaa tha
 Yudhishthira, along with Bhimsen etc
 brothers, consoled him and cremated all the heroes killed in the battlefield and donated Jalanjali money for them
 yuddh samaapti ke pashchaat, mritak logon ke liye antyeshti sanskaar kiye ja rahe the
 Then Mata Kunti requested her sons to perform all the deceased rituals for Karna as well
 jab unhone yah kahkar iskaa virodh kiya kii karn ek sood putr he, tab kunti ne karn ke janm kaa rahasy kholaa
 Then all the Pandava brothers are shocked due to the sin of fratricide
 yudhisthir vishesh rup se apni mata par rusht hote hai or unhen or samast nari jaati ko ye shraap dete hai ki us samay ke baad se striyaan kisi bhi bhed ko chupa nahin paaengi
 Both Yudhishthira and Duryodhana wanted to cremate Karna
 yudhisthir kaa daawa yah tha kii chunki ve karn ke kanisht bhrata hai isliye yah adhikaar unka he
 Duryodhana's claim was that Yudhishthira and the other Pandavas never dealt with Kern in a fraternal manner, so there is no justification for asserting this right now
 tab shrikrishna madhyasthata karaten he or yudhisthir ko yah samajhaate hai ki duryodhana kii mitrataa kaa bandhan adhik sudrudh he isliye duryodhana ko karn kaa antim sanskaar karne diya jaae
 When the 18-day war ends, Shri Krishna asks Arjuna to step down from his chariot
 jab arjuna utar jaataa he to ve use kuch duuri par le jate hai
 Then they signal Hanumanji to come off the chariot flag
 jaise hi shri hanuman us rath se utarate hai, arjuna ke rath ke ashv jivit hi jal jate hai or rath main visphot ho jaataa he
 Arjun wakes up on seeing this
 tab shrikrishna use bataate hai ki pitamah bhishma, guru dron, karn or ashwatthama ke dhatak astron ke kaaran arjuna ke rath main yah visphot hua he
 It was safe till now because he was favored by him and had the power of Shree Hanuman, the chariot still bearing the effects of these destructive weapons
 tatpashchaat kurukshetra main sharshayya par asin shantanunandan bhishma ke paas jaakar yudhisthir ne unase samast shantidaayak dharm, rajdharm, moksh dharm tathaa daandharm kii baaten sunin
 Then he came to the throne
 iske baad un shatrumardan raja ne ashwamedh yajna karke usamen brahmanon ko bahut dhan daan kiya
 Subsequently, upon hearing the news of the destruction of the Yadavas by mutual war from the curse received by Arjuna from the mouth of Arjuna, who returned from Dwarka, Yudhishthira placed Parikshit on Rajasana and went to Swargaloka with Mahaprasthan himself

 According to a tradition mentioned by Pliny in Natural History, he was the only human who laughed on the day of birth
 uske janm ke samay majdayasani dharm vikrut hua
 Superstition had replaced true knowledge
 ishwar par jhuthe devataaon ne akraman kar diya
 So, at the age of fifteen, Zarathushtra took disinterest from the world and spent seven years in solitude to seriously meditate on the mystery of human existence
 jab divya drushti kii laalasaa ne anya sari ichchhaaon kaa naash kar diya, tab divya shaktiyon main se vohu mahah unki dhyanavastha main prakat hue or unki samadhisth aatma ko ahur majd ke samaksh upasthit kiya

 bhavi jivan kii is kalpana se mrityu ke baad jivan kaa vichaar utpann hua jisaki shiksha puraani pothee ke antim bhaag main di gai he
 European writers have termed Zarathushtra's doctrine as duality, because of the mess of ideas and the misconception of opposition to Sad and Asad in the process of well-thought philosophy of the Mahatma
 is prakaar kii kalpana ne aavesta siddhant ke mul tatwon ko hi nazarandaaj kar diya he
 Research by European and Zoroastrian scholars has now definitively attested that Zarathushtra's philosophy rests on pure monotheism and that the mention of the personification of the deity is nothing but pure metaphorical mention

 vah vidyut motor jo kisi gaadi ko chalaane ke liye upyog kii jaati he, use karshan motor kehete hai
 The DC series motor was first used for traction because it is characterized by greater torque at low speeds and less turbulent at higher speeds
 or yahi cheez gadiyon ke liye bahut upyogi he 
 Later a phased alternating current-driven series motor was used
 rachana kii drushti se yah disi siries motor hi he jo disi ke bajaay ek-feji asi se chalaayi jaati he

 In this subdivision, heat heat and their effects are described
 praaia: sabhi dravyon kaa aaytan tapavriddhi se bad jaataa he
 Thermometers are made using this property
 ooshmaa yaa ooshmiya urja urja kaa ek rup he jo taap ke kaaran hota he
 Like other forms of energy, heat also flows
 kisi padaarth ke garm yaa thande hone ke kaaran usamen jo urja hoti he use uski ooshmiya urja kehete hai
 Like other energy, its unit is also joule, but it is also expressed in calories
 garm yaa thande hone kii maap taapmaana kehalaata he jise tapamapi yani tharmametre ke dwaara mapa jaataa he
 But temperature is only a measurement of heat, not thermal energy itself
 isko maapne ke liye kai pranaliyaan viksit kii gai hai jinamein celsius, forenhite tathaa kelvin pramukh hai
 The mutual relationship between them can be seen on their individual pages
 ooshmaa maapne kaa maatrak calories he
 The subdivision of science in which heat is measured is called thermodynamics
 is maapan kaa bahut mahatv he
 Specifically specific heat is theoretically of great importance and many theories are prevalent in relation to it
 ooshmaa kaa es ai maatrak jul he
 The effect of heat causes many changes in matter, which are sometimes permanent and sometimes temporary
 caco3 → cao + CO2 The unit for measuring heat is calories
 vigyaan kii jis upashakha main ooshmaa maapi jaati he, usko ooshmaamiti kehete hai
 This measurement is very important

 According to this, heat is also a form of energy
 at: iskaa roopantaran to ho saktaa he, kintu uski maatra main parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Joule etc
 proved by experiments that the conversion of these two types of energy has a calorie heat equivalent to 4
18 and 107 erg mechanical energy
 The main purpose of engineers is to convert the heat into mechanical energy and run the engine
 pratham niyam yah to bataata he ki donon prakaar kii urjaayen vastav main abhinn hai, kintu yah nahin bataata ki ek kaa duusare main parivartan kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin
 If the change of mechanical energy without intermittent heat could be possible, we could run a ship with heat from the sea
 koyale kaa vyay na hota tathaa barf bhi saath saath milti
 From experience it is proven that this cannot happen ooshmaagatiki kaa doosraa niyam yah kahata he ki aisa sambhav nahin or ek hi taap kii vastu se yantric urja kii prapti nahin ho sakati
 a low thermal mass is also required to do this
 kisi bhi ingine ke liye ucch tapiya bhatthi se praap ooshmaa ke ek ansh ko nimna tapiya pind ko dena aavashyak he
 Only the remaining part can be used in mechanical work
 samudr ke pani sa ooshmaa lekar usase jahaaj chalaanaa isaliye sambhav nahin ki vahaan par sarvatra samaan taap he or koi bhi nimna tapiya vastu maujuud nahin
 This rule has great importance

 Another form of this is that it is not possible to achieve zero ultimate temperature by any use

 Poetry is the philosophy and science of poetry and literature
 yah kavyakritiyon ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par samay-samay par udbhavit siddhanton kii gyanrashi he
 The poetry and literature of literature and craft varies according to the prevailing circumstances; As a result, poetic principles have also been constantly changing
 bharat main bharat ke siddhanton se lekar aaj tak or pashchim main sucraat or uske shishy plato se lekar adhyatan "navalochana' tak ke siddhanton ke aitihaasik anushilan se yah baat saaf ho jaati he
 In India, poetic natakadi works are called 'lakshya Granth' and theoretical texts are called 'bhavishya Granth'
 ye lakshan granth sadaa lakshya granth ke pashchaadbhaavani tathaa anugami he or mahan kavi inaki li ko chunauti dete dekhe jate hai
 The old names for poetry are 'sahitya Shastra' and 'alankashastra' and after incorporating the wide creative volume of literature, it also came to be called 'samyastashastra'
 mulat: kavyashastreey chintan shabdakavy tathaa drishykavy ke hi sambandh main siddhant sthir karata dekha jaataa he
 Aristotle's "poetics" assesses the critical criterion of comedy, tragedy, and epic, and the Natyashastra of Bharata presents only the principles of review of metaphor or voyeurism
 bharat or pashchim main yah chintan i
pus
 teesri chauthi shatee se hi praudh rup main milane lagata he jo is baat kaa parichaayak he ki kavy ke vishay main vichaar vimarsh kai sadiyon pehle hi shuru ho chukaa tha
 Poetry is basically associated with the triple dimension - poetry, poetry, poetry
 jahaan tak natyarup kavy kaa sambandh he, kavyakarta ke saath usamen natya prayogkarta natadi kaa bhi samavesh ho jaataa he
 The attention of poetic thinkers has always been on all these aspects
 sabase pehla prashn jo kavi ke sambandh main uthta he, vah yah he ki kavi yaa kalakaar anya maanav, dharmopadeshak, darshanik, vaigyanik, raajnneetik vichaarak se kis baat main vishisht he or kyon khaas prakruti ke vyakti hi kavi yaa kalakaar ban pate hai? duusare shabdon main, kavitvsakti ke hetu kya he
 Socrates and Plato consider poetry to be a product of divine charge, not a reward for study and practice
 bharat ke kavyashastri kavyrachana main pratibha ko pradhan hetu maanate hue bhi iske saath vyutpatti or abhyaas ko bhi kam mahatv nahin dete
 Conservative critics do not consider talent only for poetic power
 udhar pashchim ke romentic vichaarak kalakriti kii mul prerana ekmaatr pratibha ko hi maanate hai
 Yet all the thinkers are unanimous that the poet is a uniquely talented person who through his talent originates new creation in the form of poetry
 doosraa mahatvapurn prashn he, kavita kaa prayojan kya he? akhir kavi kavita kyon karata he? is sambandh main chintakon ke do dal hai– paramparawaadi chintak kavy kaa lakshya yaa prayojan naitik upadesh kii pratishtha maanate hai
 Through poetry, the poet wants to establish some values, just like a religious preacher
 kintu fark yah he ki uski kriti shailicilp kii drushti se romantic or rasmay hone ke kaaran dharmagranthon yaa nitigranthon se vishisht ban jaati he
 The Romantic thinker does not accept this
 vah kavi ko upadeshak nahin maanata
 According to him, the poet is the creator, the creator, who is also distinct from Brahma
 vah apni sristi, apni kalakriti ke madhyam se hamaare saamne rakhata he
 In fact, he wants to express his feelings through poetry
 kavy or kuch nahin, uski samast anubhutiyon kaa sarabhat tatv or uske antas main umadte-ghumdate bhaavon kaa swat: baha hua pariwaah maatr he
 Nearly all the mismatches of East and West can be merged into these two camps
 kavy kaa sabase mahatvapurn paksh vah kriti he, jo hamaare samaksh chakshush, shravan tathaa bauddhik sannikarsh kaa madhyam banati he or is madhyam se vah hamaare man yaa sanvit ko prabhavit karti he
 Therefore, in poetic thinking, this is the main aspect whose thinkers of East and West have been crying over the last two and a half thousand years about many aspects
 sabase pehla sawaal jo kavy ke kathy ke vishay main uthta he, vah yah he ki kavy main varnit ghatnaayen aadi kahan tak vaigyanik satya se mail khaati hai
 It is generally accepted by all critics that poetry does not take the form of fact-telling system
 usamen jis satya kaa samudghaatan hota he, vah vaastavik satya na hokar sambhavya satya hota he
 On this basis, anti-poets declare the imagination of the poet as confusing or far from the truth
 plato ne to ise satya se duhara dur siddh kiya he
 The thinkers of India have not considered poetry to be an illusion, although at one place Bhatt Lollat has interpreted Rā मेंa Adi in the form of the Nats imitating Rāma etc
 in the play of the play, while interpreting the Rasasutra
 pashchim main idhar manovigyaan ke vikaas ke pariprekshya main kavyashastreey chintan ne bhrantivaale is paksh ko or adhik majboot kiya he
 It is said that art is just an illusion
 isi se miltaa julata ek or mat bhi he
 Art is nothing but hypnosis
 idhar nritatv vigyaan ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par bhi kavy kii sammohini shakti par jor diya jane laga he or yah mat prabal ho uthaa he ki kavy yaa kala main puraane aadim samaaj ke ojhaaon ke mantron kii tarah jaadui asar hota he 
 This question arises here, after all, whether this illusion, hypnosis or magical effect, if we want to borrow the words of the old scholars, the "miracle" of poetry is caused by what elements? Poetry is basically fixed in language
 bhashaa shabd or arth kaa sanshlisht rup he
 Hence, the first question that will arise is whether poetry is merely wordy or semantic
 hamaare yahan ye donon mat prachlit hai
 Thinkers like Bhamah, Kuntaka, Mammat consider the word and its combined element of meaning to be poetic, not just the word or only the meaning, because in poetry, the two cannot be separated from each other
 is mat ke anusaar kavy ko chamatkaarshali yaa sammohak banane ke liye shabd or arth donon kii romaniyata par kavi ko samaan bal dena hoga
 The second view places more emphasis on the word in the influence of poetry, that is, on the auditory side than on its intellectual side
 prasiddh sanskrit kavi panditraj jagannatha kaa yahi mat he
 This view seems to be of those who emphasize more on the rhythm of poetry, vocabulary, verses and Shravan Bimbavatta
 pashchim ke svachhndathawadi sameekshak, visheshat: france ke pratikwaadi kavi or aalochak, saaf kehete hai ki kavy arth yaa vichaar se nahin banataa balki shabdon se banataa he 
 If we compare this opinion with the meaningless Shabarajal mantras of the exorcists, then we will find that here also the meaning is not important, but the rhythm of the words, the tone of the chanting of the exorcist Ojha is said to influence the patient and do psychotherapy
 yahi paddati manovishleshnatmak upachaar kii bhi he
 Word and meaning have been considered of special importance in creating the effect of poetry, so it becomes imperative to consider the relation of word and meaning in poetic thinking
 shabd kaa apane paramparaagat arth se niyat sambandh hota he
 This relationship has been called Abhidha Vyapaar here
 kintu bhashaa main is vyapaar ke atirikt anya vyapaar bhi kaary karata dekha jaataa he, jahaan shabd apane niyat arth ko chhodkar usase sambhddha kisi duusare arth kii pratiti bhi kara saktaa he, jise lakshana vyapaar kehete hai
 Aristotle has also discussed both these trades of language in his famous treatise "rhetorics"
 kavyabhasha main vastut: shabd abhidhaparak na hokar lakshanik hote hai
 There is a greater emphasis on this matter here in the West and it was started by the romanticist poet and thinker Coleridge
 uske anusaar samast kavyabhasha lakshanik he
 Other modern poets like IA Richards, Empson etc
 have also accepted this view
 is mat ke anusaar kavy main upatt bimb, roopak, pratik or myth sabhi bhashaa kii lakshanik prakriyaayein hai or itnaa hi nahin, kavy kaa chandovidhan, lay or shabdashayya kaa prayojan bhi sarvatha lakshanik he
 Similar to this view we have here of the soundist poeticist who in euphemism, goes a step ahead of the symptom and envisages euphemism and considers all the elements of poetry as expressions of feeling or as a satire
 udhar vakroktivaadee kuntak bhi kavy main upatt shabd or arth ke vyapaar ko saadhaaran abhidha na maanakar vichitramidha yaa vakrokti kehete hai or is vakrokti kaa viniyog varna, pad, vaakya, arthprakaran, prabandh jaise kavyangon main nirdisht karte hai
 The basic foundation of this division of Kuntaka rests on the formalist theory of Vamana
 yah kavy kii sanghatana yaa sanrachana kaa vishleshan kar uske un angon ke sammohak tatv ko samudghaatit karti he jo kavy sunne yaa padhanevaale ko prabhavit karte hai
 This analysis is associated with grammar and philology on the one hand and on the other hand, with artistic thinking
 idhar america main jo sanrachnawadi paddati kii nai kavyasamiksha chal padi he, vah usee drushtikon ko lekar chali jiskaa sutarapaat sanskrit kaavyon ke vivechan ke sambandh main hamaare yahan apane-apane dhang se vaaman, aanandavardhan or kuntak kar chuke hai
 Given the extent of the essay, it is not possible to discuss all the ideas from time to time on different parts of poetry
 kavy ke mulat: do paksh hai
 One is the Katyapaksha, which we find in the particular type of content of the content and the inner sensation of artistic feeling or rasadi expressed from it
 doosraa he kavy kaa shailipaksh jisamen lay, chand, shabdachayan, gun or alankaar kii yojana kaa vivechan hota he
 These elements have been discussed in detail by thinkers of East and West
 kintu yahan itnaa samajha lenaa hoga ki kavy kii prabhavanviti samgr hoti he
 All these elements in their own way are seen to contribute to that overall effectiveness
 hamaare yahan alankaarawaadi or ritivaadee sameekshak is samgr prabhavanvitivaale mat ko nahin maanate
 They consider the beauty or miracle of poetry in the meaning of ornamentation or in specific designation
 kintu vakroktivaadee or dhvanivaadee prabhaav kii drushti se kavy kii samagrata ko lekar chalate hai, bhale hi vishleshan kii drushti se ve bhi uske tattat ansh kii mimasaa karte hon
 Traditional critics in the West similarly do not judge the totality of poetry in terms of influence, and in poetry it is seen to give importance to ornamentation, utterance, far-sighted imagination
 vahaan bhi isa kii duusari shatee main ek aisa chintak hua he jisane kavy kii is samagrata ke siddhant ko pratishthapit kiya tha
 This is the core of Longinus's sublime theory
 pashchim ke romentic kavi or aalochak bhi kavy kaa chamatkaar samagrata main hi maanate hai or kuch aisi hi dharna hindi ke chhayavaadi or chhayavadottar aalochakon kii he
 The various poetic theories like ornament, ritual, curvature, rasa, sound, justification, miracle that we had, are basically based on what part of the beauty of poetry
 inkaa vishesh vivechan yahan anaavashyak hoga
 The third element after the poet and the poet is the listener or reader of the poem and the spectator of the play which is called Sahridaya in the words of the soundist
 sahruday kaa arth he samaan hridayvaala vah vyakti jo kavyanushilan ke samay usamen tanmayeebhoot hokar kavi ke samaan hridayvaala ban jaae
 This similarity of his heart is also related to the specific character or heroine mentioned in the poem
 is samanhridayata ko sthapit karne ke liye bhatnayak ne saadhaaraneekaran vyapaar kii kalpana kii thi jise abhinavgupt ne bhi maan liya he
 According to these Raswadis of India, in the mind of Kavyanushilaka, the raga disguise form Raja and all the qualities of the child, and the liberation of truth causes the mind to experience relaxation
 abhinavgupt is sthiti ko yogiyon kii samadhisthiti ke samaan maanate hai
 No theory has emerged in the West to regard the soul of poetry as an element like rasa, but in the last century there has been a theory developed by the rise of Romanticism that the listener or reader of poetry has empathy or sympathy with the poet or poetical character
 Experiences, as we have with Shakespeare's Hamlet or Macbeth, and with the style's prominence
 apane yahan, rasadasha tak ham kaise pahonchte hai, iskaa apane dhang se manovaigyanik vishleshan abhinavgupt ke yahan miltaa he
 But it is just a structure
 abhi haal main hue manovigyaangat shodhon ke kaaran is paksh par adhik prakaash padaa he
 a special branch of psychology, in which physiology is studied by our neoplasms and how the hearing, visual, sparsion, olfactory and nasal images, or their imagination, affects our brain and how it stimulates our psyche It happens, discoveries have been made and are happening that affect the how, why and how of poetry and artwork on the poetic Is busy in its deliberations
 uparyukt vivechan se spasht hoga ki aaj kavyashastreey chintan kaa kshetra kitna vistrut ho gaya he
 On the one hand he touches the ends of grammar, philology, art, philosophy and rhetoric, on the other hand he is also associated with psychology and physiology
 itnaa hi nahin, jab ham kavy ke aitihaasik, saamaajik preranasroton kii ore bhi dhyaan dene lagate hai to kavyashastra kaa dayera or bad jaataa he or vah samajashaastra, itihaas tathaa raajnneetik chintan se bhi ja judata he
 This is why many poetics will be found in today's poetic thinking
 kuch aisi hai jo paramparawaadi purvi yaa pashchimi saanche main dhali hai, kuch pashchim ke svachhndathawadi, kalavaadi, dadavadi, bhavishyavaadee yaa astitvvaadi siddhanton se judi hai or kuch yaa to friid ke manovishleshanvaad athwa marks ke saamaajik yathartwaadee darshan se sambhddha hai

 The Ilbert Bill was a law in India suggested by Viceroy Ripon during the British Raj in 1883 under which district-level Indian judges were to be empowered to issue judicial orders on British judges

 The bill was named after Courtney Ilbert, legal adviser to the Viceroy's Council of India

 From the point of view of prose style, this narrative management is an important work and is considered as a definite step in the development of the genre of Sanskrit prose poetry
 nahar jal parivahan tathaa sthaanantaran kaa maanav-nirmit sanrachana he
 The word canal signifies a waterway which, rather than natural, is man-made
 mukhyat: iskaa prayog kheti ke liye jal ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak pahunchane main kiya jaataa he
 The canals carry the water of rivers to different areas for irrigation
 aise jalmaarg pracheen samay se banate rahe hai
 Besides making irrigation canals, keeping them in good condition is a very important task
 at: nahar vibhaag, bharat jaise krishipradhan desh ke prashasan main vishesh sthaan rakhte hai
 Irrigation canals flow the priceless fund of the country on which agricultural production depends a large amount
 naharon ke sanchaalan ke liye vishesh kanoon bane hue hai, jinke antargat nahar vibhaag apana kaary chalaate hai
 In any country, there is a huge help in the development of traffic or agriculture through canals
 kahin-kahin to bade-bade kshetron kii sampurna aarthik shrunkhlaa naharon ke upar hi aadhaarit hoti he
 In addition to profitable waterways, there is also a lot of use in canals, in the sports sector and in the areas of growth of industries etc
 isi kaaran sansar kii badi-badi kritiyon main naharon kaa vishisht sthaan he
 It is created mainly for two purposes
 pehla to do yaa adhik jalkhandon yaa saritaaon ke milaane ke liye, jiske dwaara jalmaarg se yatayaat ho sake - yah yatayaat choti choti naukaaon dwaara ho athwa bade bade jahaajon dwaara
 The second objective is to make the water from the river or ponds to be transported far and wide by canals to meet the water supply, water supply and other needs
 pehle uddeshy ke liye bani naharen sansar ke sabhi bhaagon main pai jaati hai
 One such canal was built by the Mughals in Delhi, on the banks of which the then Prime Minister of India, Mr
 Jawaharlal Neh Ancestor, lived, hence his family's name was Neh degree
 aisi naharen badi-badi bhi hoti hai
 The world's famous Suez Canal joins the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, and the Panama Canal facilitates traffic between the Pacific and Atlantic two oceans
 donon naharen aadhunik yug kii dein hai or ejineering kii mahaan kritiyon main inaki gananaa hoti he
 a special difference between canals and other waterways is that other waterways, such as rivers, streams, and seas, remain natural in that condition, but treatment has to be always done to keep the canals in good condition
 udhaaharan ke liye, suez nahar ko yatayaat yogya banaae rakhane ke liye, usamen se ret nikaalane ke liye, badi badi mashine sadaa kaam main lagi rahati hai or bahut badi sankhya main ejeeniyar uski dekhbhaal ke liye rakhane padate hai
 In addition, "locks" are often made for traffic in canals
 in "lokon" dwaara unchi nichi satahon ke bich yatra sambhav ho jaati he
 Not only among the seas, many rivers and lakes are also connected by canals for traffic
 kashmir main dal lake or jhelum nadi ke bich aise lock sthit hai
 There are many cities in the world where canals can carry traffic within the city itself, such as the world famous Venice city of Italy
 holland main bahut si naharen amsterdam aadi nagaron main yatayaat ke liye bani hui hai
 In India too, large canals have been built for traffic between cities such as Buckingham Canal in South India
 choti choti yatayaat naharen to desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main bahut si bani hui hai
 The second purpose of canals is to transport water from a river or lake to a far distance for the purpose of water supply or irrigation
 is disha main bharat main bahut kaary 19veen shatabdi main hua he
 By the way, many canals built from ancient times are seen in different parts of the country
 kintu vishesh kaary bhusinchan kshetra main hi hua he, kyonki bharat krishipradhan desh he
 Very large canals were built for land exploration
 kai shatabdiyon purv dakshin bharat main kaveri nadi par ek ainikat banaakar naharen nikaali gai thim
 In the modern era, large canals were constructed from the Ganges River, the Sutlej and Beas rivers in Punjab, through which millions of acres of land benefited from irrigation
 ganga yamuna ke doaab main ganga kii upree tathaa nichali ganga nahar se milakar lagbhag 32 lakh acre bhoomi kii sinchai prati varsh hoti he
 For this, the Doab areas of the Ganges Yamuna are spread around 8,000 miles of small canals, which irrigate the area between various rivers and streams
 yah bharat kii sabase badi bhusinchan-pranali he
 Apart from this, hydropower is also produced from the waterfalls located on the Ganges Canal
 at: naharon dwaara bahumukhi vikaas hota he or unase sinchit kshetra main krishi kii vruddhi ke saath saath udyog dhandhon main bhi pragati hoti he or logon kaa jeevanaster unchaa karne main badi sahaayta milti he
 The administration also earns revenue from good canals, such as the upper and lower Ganga canals, the Uttar Pradesh administration made a profit of about Rs 1
6 crore in 1958-59, after deducting all expenses
 naharen maanav nirmit jal pravaahan pranaliyaan hai jo do tarah kii hoti hai: 1
 Aqueduct: Those used for agricultural or human use
 taaze pani ko bhi zarurat ke mutabik pravaahit kiya jaataa he
 2
 Waterway canals: These canals are used in traffic
 yatriyon yaa vastuon ko jahaaz or naaven in naharon kaa prayog ke zariye idhar udhar le jate hai
 These canals connect existing lakes, rivers, and salamander
 jaise mashhoor suez or panama kii naharen
 nahar shabd multah farsi shabd he
 In the cities of netherlands, the city's canals are also called gracht
 sinchai kii naharon ke nirmaan main vishesh baat yah hoti he ki ye naharen aise pathon se le jaai jaati hai jahaan sambhavat: naharon ke donon kinaaron kii ore pani sinchai ke liye nikalakar bah sake
 Hence the flow of the canal is planned through irrigated area on the highest land
 nadi or naale iske vipareet, kshetra ke neeche se neeche hisse main hokar behate hai
 In fact, canals often originate on high ground between two rivers or streams
 kahin-kahin is ucch bhoomi tak pahunchne main naharon ko kai nadiyaan or naale paar karne padate hai
 For example, the Upper Ganga Canal has to cross four mountainous rivers, about 20 miles between Haridwar and Roorkee, at its origin, and that too in varying degrees
 vastav main rudki se haridwar tak upree ganga nahar ke saath pakki sadak jaati he or in 20 milon main ejineering ke kuch mahatvapurn kaaryon ko dekhne kaa avasar miltaa he
 At two places, the canal crosses the mountainous rivers at one place, the river is merged with the canal and at another place, over the Solani aqueduct, the canal passes over the river
 solani aquidct vishwavikhyath he
 This important work, with only bricks and lime, was completed in about 1850 AD
 sinchai kii nahar jaise-jaise aage badhati he, vah ped kii shaakhon kii tarah choti hoti jaati he
 On the contrary, as the rivers move, they become larger and their tributaries and streams continue to meet in them
 shakhaon se vitaran nahar athwa rajbahe nikalate hai or inamen choti naharen, jinhen miner yaa bambe kehete hai, nikalati hai
 From all these canals, water is extracted for fields by kulabe, maudhe or out late
 yah sab vitaran vaigyanik rup se nidhurit siddhoton ke anukool hota he
 If this is not done, the water cannot reach the canals, which carry water for hundreds of miles
 iske liye sarkari vibhaag sthapit he jinamein kushal ejeeniyar log naharon ko acchhee haalat main rakhane or unamem nirdhaarit maatra main pani chalaane ke liye niyukt hote hai
 Water in the canals is also run at such a speed that there is no erosion nor sediment in the canal
 jahaan bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he, prapaat bana die jate hai, taaki nahar kii tali kii dhaal nirdhaarit dasha main rakhi ja sake
 a lot of research work in this direction has been and continues to happen in India
 or bhi bahut si samasyaayen naharon ke sanchaalan main saamne aati rahati hai, jinka samaadhaan karne kaa uttardaayitv ejiniyaron ke upar rahata he
 Evacuations are also made in the canals as per the requirement, by which the additional water can be drained into the adjacent river or drains when not required or during any breakage
 aisa bahudhaa hota he ki nahar puri chal rahi he or us kshetra main baari varsha ho gai jisase paan kii maang shunya ho gai
 In such a situation Moghe or Kulabe have to be closed
 parantu sampurna pani ko nahar saadh nahin sakati, at: pani ko nikaas dwaara nadi yaa naalon main nikaalnaa anivaary ho jaataa he
