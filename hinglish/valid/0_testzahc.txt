 After the Sultanate of Turan was destroyed after Timur Shah Hussein Baykra, Sherli came to Kabul to test his fortune
 uskaa betaa yarali or pota sammli afghanistan chale aaye
 Babar was appointed as the ruler of Ghazni by Yarli
 thode hi dinon ke baad uske marane par bete sammli ko vahiin darja mila
 He too died soon
 alp vayask bairam apane gharavaalon ke saath balkh chalaa gaya
 He kept studying for a few days in Humatabalkh with Humayun
 phir vah samavayask shahzada humayun kaa naukar or baad main uskaa mitra ho gaya
 Bairam Khan also loved literature and music
 vah jaldi hi apane swami kaa atyant priy ho gaya tha
 Bairam Khan showed great valor in a battle at the age of 16, his fame reached Babur, then Babar himself said to him: Attend the court with Shahzada
 babar ke marane ke baad vah humayun badshaah kii chaaya ke taur par rahane laga
 Humayun laid siege to the fortress of Champaner
 kisi tarah se daal galati na dekhakar chalis mogul bahadur sidhiyon ke saath qile main utar gaye, jinamein bairam khaan bhi tha
 The fort was conquered
 shershah se chausa main ladate vaqt bairam khaan bhi saath hi tha
 He also fought in Kannauj
 in sabhi ghatnaon ne humayun or bairam khaan ko ek atoot mitrataa main band diya tha
 After the defeat in the battle of Jeevan Danakannauj, the horn of the Mughal army, whose horn he had, ran away
 bairam khaan apane puraane dost sambhal ke miyaan abdul wahaab ke paas pahunchaa
 Then the king of Lucknow spent days in the jungles near Mitrasen
 shershahi haakim naseer khaan ko pataa laga
 He ordered Bairam Khan to hold him
 naseer khaan chahta tha ki bairam khaan ko katl kar den, par doston kii koshish se bairam khaan kisi prakaar se batch gaya
 In the end, he had to appear in front of Sher Shah, who did not give importance to a minor Mughal chieftain and forgave him and donated his life
 qandahar ke haakim kaa padberam khaan phir se gujarat ke sultan mahmud ke paas gaya, par use apane swami se milane kii dhun thi
 When Hijri returned to Iran in 950 and Humayun proceeded towards Sind, taking Kabul, Bairam Khan fought with his men on behalf of Humayun
 humayun ko isaki khabar lagi to uski khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa
 In India, success was not going to come, so Humayun traveled to Iran
 bairam khaan bhi uske saath tha
 In total there were no more than seventy men in the royal convoy
 iran se lautakar humayun ne qandahar ko gheraa
 He wished, the brother-in-law should understand and stop the bloodshed
 use samajhane ke liye humayun ne bairam khaan ko kabul bheja, lekin vah kahan hone vaala tha
 By taking over Kandahar, Bairam Khan was appointed as the governor
 qandahar vijay ke bare main humayun ne swayan kaha-“roj nauroj bairam’st imroj”
 Dile Ahhab Begum'st Imrose
 se parajeet hokar mogul amir niraash ho chuke the
 He wanted to return to Kabul, but Bairam Khan stopped him
 saazikabar kii doodhmata maham anaga nity hi bairam khaan ke kilaaf saazishen rachati rahati thi
 In the Mughal court, there was a group of Maham Anaga, who always used to degrade Bairam
 hijri 961 main in logon ne chugali lagaai ki bairam khaan swatantra hona chahta he, lekin bairam khaan namak-haraam nahin tha
 When Humayun had reached Kandahar himself one day, Bairam Khan desired that the emperor take him with him, but Kandahar was also a very important place, for which no better ruler could be found than Bairam Khan
 bairam khaan humayun kaa sahyogi tathaa uske naaballig putr akbar kaa vali athwa sangrakshak tha
 He was also the ultimate friend and ally of Emperor Humayun
 apane samast jivan main bairam khaan ne mogul samrajya kii bahut seva kii thi
 Bairam Khan had a huge hand in regaining his kingdom to Humayun and winning him in many wars
 akbar ko bhi bharat kaa samraat banane ke liye bairam khaan ne asankhya yuddh kiye or hemu jaise shaktishaalee raja ko haraakar bharat main mogul samrajya kii sthapana main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 In the Mughal Empire, Akbar's milkmaid Maham Unga was the one who used to plot against Bairam Khan
 ye inhen sazishon kaa nateeja tha ki bairam ko haj ke liye aadesh diya gaya, jahaan 1561 i
 main uski hatya kar di gai
 Dynasty Parichayram Khan was related to Turkman race of Turan
 hyderabad ke nizaam bhi turkman the
 According to historian Qasim Farishta, he was associated with the Baharalu branch of Karakuilu Turkmen of Iran
 alishkar beg turkman taimur ke prasiddh saradaaron main se ek tha, jise hamadaan, dinwar, khujistan aadi par shaasha niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Sheri Baig was among Alishkar's children
 temuri shah husain bikera ke baad jab turan main sultanate barabaad hui, to shephali kabul kii taraf bhagya pariksha karne ke liye aayaa
 His son Yarli and grandson Saifali migrated to Afghanistan
 yarali ko babar ne gazani kaa haakim niyukt kiya
 After a few days on his death, son Saifali got the same status
 vah bhi jaldi hi mar gaya
 The young adult Bairam went away with his family members
 humayun se mitrataabalkh main vah kuch dinon tak padhata-likhata rahaa
 Then he became the servant of the contemporary Shahzada Humayun and later his friend
 bairam khaan ko sahitya or sangeet se bhi bahut prem tha
 He soon became very dear to his master
 16 varsh kii aayu main hi ek ladaai main bairam khaan ne bahut veerta dikhaai, uski khyaati babar tak pahunch gai, tab babar ne khud usase kaha : shahzada ke saath darbar main hajir karo
 After Babur's death, he started living as the shadow of Humayun Emperor
 humayun ne champaner ke qile par gheraa daalaa
 Seeing no mistake, Dal Mughal Bahadur descended into the fort with stairs, including Bairam Khan
 qila fatah kar liya gaya
 Bairam Khan was also with Sher Shah while fighting in Chausa
 kannauj main bhi vah ladaa
 All these events tied Humayun and Bairam Khan into an unbreakable friendship
 jivan daanakannauj kii ladaai main paraajay ke baad mogul sena main jisaki sing jidhar samaai, vah udhar bhaaga
 Bairam reached Mian Abdul Wahab of his old friend Sambhal
 phir lakhanu ke raja mitrasen ke paas jangalon main din guzaartaa rahaa
 Sher Shahi Hakim Naseer Khan came to know
 usne bairam khaan ko pakad mangavaya
 Naseer Khan wanted to kill Bairam Khan, but Bairam Khan somehow escaped from the efforts of friends
 ant main use shershah ke saamne hajir hona padaa, jisane ek maamuli mogul sardaar ko mahatv na dekar use maaf kar diya or jivan daan de diya
 The office of the ruler of Kandahar went again to the Sultan of Gujarat, Mahmud, but he was in tune to meet his master
 jab hijri 950 main humayun iran se lautakar kabul lete sindh kii ore badha, to bairam khaan apane aadamiyon ke saath humayun kii ore se ladane laga
 Humayun got the news of this, then he was not happy
 hindustan main safalataa milane vaali nahin thi, isliye humayun ne iran kaa rasta kiya
 Bairam Khan was also with him
 shahi kafile main kul milakar sattar aadmi se zyaada nahin the
 Humayun besieged Kandahar after returning from Iran
 usne chaha, bhai kamran ko samajha-bujhaakar koon-karaaba roka jaae
 Humayun sent Bairam Khan to Kabul to convince him, but where he was going to be
 qandahar par adhikaar karke bairam khaan ko vahaan kaa haakim niyukt kiya gaya
 Regarding Kandahar Vijay, Humayun himself said- "rose Nauroz Bairam's' Emrose"
 dile ahabaab begum’st imroj
 After being defeated by the Mughal emir, he was disappointed
 vah kabul laut janaa chaahate the, par bairam khaan ne unhen roak diya
 Intrigue Akbar's milkmaid Maham Anga was always plotting against Bairam Khan
 mogul darbar main maham anaga kaa ek samooh tha, jo hameshaa hi bairam ko nicha dikhaane main laga rahata tha
 In Hijri 961, these people cheated that Bairam Khan wants to be independent, but Bairam was not salt-free
 humayun ek din jab swayan qandahar pahunchaa tha, tab bairam khaan ne bahut chaha ki badshaah use apane saath le chale, lekin qandahar bhi ek bahut mahatvapurn sthaan tha, jiske liye bairam khaan se badhkar acha shaasha nahin mil sak Jadoptia is a folk painting of the Santal tribe, resident of the jharkhand-bihar border, which has the ability to fully express the history and philosophy of this society

 teesraa angl-burmi yuddh 14-27 navambar 1885 ke bich hua sangharsh tha, iske baad 1887 tak chhit-put pratirodh tathaa vidroh chalate rahe the
 This was the last of the three wars fought between the Burmese and the British in the 19th century
 is yuddh ke parinamswarup konbong rajvansh dwaara sanchalit swatantra burma ne apni prabhusatta kho di, jinka shashan pehle hi upree burma ke naam se gyaat kshetra tak simit ho chukaa tha, nichle burma ko british logon dwaara 1853 ke, duusare angl-burmi yuddh main jeet ke falswaroop apane shashan main le liya gaya tha
 After this war, Burma, as a territory of India, came under the British Raj
 iske baad 1937 se, british log burma ko bharat se alag karke ek alag upnivesh ke rup main shashan karne lage
 Burma gained independence as a republic in 1948
 1879 main burma main uttaradhikaar sankat ke baad, burma se british resident ko waapas bula liya gaya tathaa deshon ke bich aadhikarik rajanyik sambandh samaapt ho gaye
 The British thought about the war as a reaction, but they did not start a war at that time due to the ongoing wars in Africa and Afghanistan
 1880 ke dashak ke dauraan, british log burma or france ke bich sthapit samparkon ke vishay main chintit hone lage
 French people came to the border of Burma in the indo-china War
 may 1883 main, ek ucch stareey burman pratinidhimandal europe gaya
 Officially these people went to collect industrial knowledge, but soon they reached Paris where they started talking to French Foreign Minister Jules Ferry
 antat pheri ne british rajdoot se yah sweekaar kiya ki burman log sainya upkarnon kii kharid ke saath hi rajnatik gathjod kaa prayaas bhi kar rahe the
 The British were worried by the Burmese effort and relations between the two countries worsened
 paris main francisi tathaa burman logon ke vaartalap main bharat ke seemaant kshetron tathaa burma ke bich ek seemaa vivaad saamne aayaa
 In 1881, the British authorities in India appointed a commission to mark the boundary between the two countries
 apane kaary ke dauraan, british ayog ne maang kii ki ve gaanv jo british logon ke anusaar unki taraf the, vahaan se burman praadhikariyon ko hataa liya jaye
 burman logon ne nirantar aapatti kii lekin antat ve peeche hat gaye
 In 1885, M
 Hass Mandalay moved to the French Embassy
 unhone burma main ek francisi bank kii sthapana, mandley se ek british burma ke uttari seemaa tak railway kii riyaayat or burman sarkaar dwaara niyantrit ekadhikarik udyogon main francisi bhoomika ke liye baat-chit kii
 The British reacted with diplomatic force and the French government removed Haas from there for alleged "health reasons"
 haalanki frans, burma sambandhit muddon par peeche hat gaya, francisi hastkshep ke saath-saath kai anya ghatnaon ke kaaran british logon ne burma ke viruddh kaarywai karne kaa nishchay kar liya
 The Bombay Burma Trading Corporation was fined for showing underestimation of teak extraction from Tongu and non-payment to its employees
 company par jurmaana ek burman adaalat ne lagaaya tha or uski kuch lakdi ko burman adhikariyon dwaara jabt kar liya gaya tha
 The company and the British government claimed that the allegations were false and the Burmese courts are corrupt
 british logon ne burma sarkaar se maang kii ki ve is vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye britain dwaara niyukt ek madhyasth ko sweekaar karen
 When the Burmese refused, the British issued a warning on 22 October 1885
 chetavanee main maang kii gayi ki burma ke log mandley main ek nae british resident ko sweekaar karen, company ke viruddh koi kanoonee karrwai athwa jurmaana resident ke aagaman tak nilambit kiya jaye, burma apane videshi sambandhon ko british niyantran ke liye prastut kare tathaa burma british logon ko vyapaarik suvidhaayen pradaan kare jisase uttari burma tathaa china ke saath vyapaar kaa vikaas kiya ja sake
 With the acceptance of the warning, all types of real Burman independence would be ended and it would remain a nominal autonomous 'princely' state of British India
 By November 9, a practical denial of these terms reached Rangoon, upon which Mandalay's authority and the Burmese king Theob Min's relinquishment of the throne depended
 yah bhi mana ja saktaa he ki burma rajya ke vilay kaa nirnay ho chukaa tha
 At this time, beyond the fact that this country was a dense forest, and therefore completely unsuitable for military operations, the British had little knowledge of Upper Burma; But the British steamers on the Great River Highway of the Irrawaddy River had been running from Rangoon to Mandalay for many years, and it was only natural that the British expedition should be taken most rapidly and satisfactorily from the waterway directly to the capital
 In addition, the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company's large number of wind-powered steamers and barges were available in Rangoon, and company officials had spatial knowledge of the direction of the difficult paths of the river to the British forces

 As expected with any such expedition, both the Navy and the Army were engaged in it; And as always, naval and artillery were the most important

 On 16th, the artillery on both the banks was captured by land invasion, the Burmese were not ready for it, they could not resist
 However, on 17 November at Minhala, which was on the right bank of the river, a large number of Burmese forces, one after the other, captured a pagoda and a stronghold of Minhala
 nadi ke paar se kii ja rahi bambaari ke neeche british bhartiya paidal sena kii ek brigade ne hamale ko badhaate hue barmanon ko parajeet kiya tathaa isamen burman dal ke 170 log maare gaye, 276 bandi banaaye gaye tathaa iske saath hi bahut se log bhaagane ke prayaas main nadi main dub kar mar gaye
 The campaign continued for the next few days, with naval platoon and heavy artillery silencing the Burman defense lines at Nyong-yu, Pakokku and Myingyan one after the other
 haalanki, kuch sutron kaa kahana he ki burman pratirodh teevr isliye nahin tha kyonki thibow ke raksha mantri kinvon min gyi you kong, jo ki british logon ke saath sandhi karnaa chaahate the, unhone burman phujon ko british logon par akraman na karne ko kaha
 unke aadesh kaa paalan kuch burman palatnon dwaara to kiya gaya, parantu sabake dwaara nahin

 Others Others: saanchaa:haddees Qutb al-sittah is six books containing collections of hadith

 He is sometimes referred to as al-sahih al-sittah, which translates as the "authentic six"
 unhen pehali baar 11 veen shatabdi main ebn al-qaasrani dwaara aupchaarik rup se samoohikrut or paribhaashit kiya gaya tha, jinhone sunan ebn maajah ko suchi main joda tha
 Since then, he has sung near-universal acceptance as part of the official doctrine of Sunni Islam
 sabhi sunni muslim nyaayashastra vidwaan ebn majah ke mutaluq sahamat nahin hai
 In particular, al-mawattah such as Maliki and Ibn al-athir consider the sixth book
 ebn majah se sunan ko jodne kaa kaaran yah he ki isamen kai haddees shaamil hai jo anya paanch main nahin aate hai, jabaki muvatta ke sabhi haddees anya sahih kitabon main shaamil hai
 Sunni Muslims consider the six major Hadith collections to be their most important, although the order of authenticity varies among religions ebn hajar ke anusaar, pehle do, jise aamtaur par do sahahih ke rup main janaa jaataa he, unki pramanikta ke sanket ke rup main, lagbhag saat hajaar haddees hote hai, yadi punrariti kii gananaa nahin kii jaati he

 gopal ram gahamri hindi ke mahaan sevak, upanyaaskaar tathaa patrkaar the
 He ran a magazine called 'detective' for 38 years without any cooperation, wrote more than 200 novels, translated hundreds of stories, even translated 'chitraganda' poetry of Rabindranath Thakur
 vah aise lekhak the, jinhone hindi kii ahernish seva kii, logon ko hindi padhgaye ko utsahit kiya, aisi rachanaaon kaa srijan karte rahe ki logon ne hindi sikhi
 If non-hindi speakers learned Hindi to read the works of another writer after Devkinandan Khatri, then he was Gopalram Gahmari
 gahamri ne prarambh main naatakon kaa anuwaad kiya, phir upanyaason kaa anuwaad karne lage
 His translation from Bangla to Hindi was then considered very authentic
 bahumukhi pratibha ke dhani gopalram gahamri ne kavitaayen, naatak, upanyaas, kahani, niabandh or sahitya kii vividh vidhaon main lekhan kiya, lekin prasiddhi mili jasusi upanyaason ke kshetra main
 Launched a monthly magazine called 'detective'
 iske liye inhen praayah ek upanyaas har maheene likhnaa padaa
 Ghamriji wrote over 200 detective novels
 'adbhut laash', 'bekasoor kii faansee', 'sarakati laash', 'dabl jasoos', 'bhayankar chori', 'khooni kii khoj' tathaa 'guptbhed' inke pramukh upanyaas hai
 The tradition of espionage novel writing, which Ghamri gave birth, could not develop in Hindi
 gopal ram gahamri kaa janm pus krishna 8 guuruuvaar sanwat 1923 main uttar pradesh ke gajipur jile ke gahammer main hua tha
 His great-grandfather Shri Jagannath Sahu was a merchant of French Chintz
 unke do putr the-raghunandan or brijmohan
 Raghunandanji had three sons, Ram Narayan, Kalicharan and Ramdas
 gopalram gahamri, ramnarayanji ke putr the
 Kalicharan was a childless and Mahavir Prasad Gahmari had only one son of Ramdas
 gopalram gahamri ko bhi ek hi putr the ikbaal narayan
 Mahavir Prasad Gahmari had two sons, Devta Prasad Ghamri and Durga Prasad Ghamri
 devtaa prasad gahamri bahut dinon tak kaashi se prakashit hone vaale dainik 'aaj' or 'sanhmaarg' se jude rahe
 When Gopal Ram Gahmari was six months old, his father died and his mother moved to his Mache Gahmar
 gahammer main hi gopal ram kaa laalan-paalan hua
 Early education and rites were concluded here
 gahammer se atirikt lagaav ke kaaran unhone apane naam ke saath apane is nanihaal ko jod liya or gopalram gahamri kahalaane lage
 He had his early education in Gahmar
 vahiin se varnakular middle kii shiksha grahan kii
 Passed middle in 1879
 phir vahiin gahammer skool main chaar varsh tak chaatro ko padhaate rahe or khud bhi urdu or angareji kaa abhyaas karte rahe
 After this, Patna was admitted to the Normal School, where admission was made on the condition that upon passing, middle pass students would have to teach for three years
 aarthik sthiti acchhee na hone ke kaaran is shart ko sweekaar kar liya
 But leaving middle school, Gahmari ji went to work at Betia Maharaja School instead of Head Pandit
 san 1888 i main sab kaamon se chuttee kar hai first grad main narmal kii pariksha paas kii
 Soon after in 1889, he was appointed headmaster at Rohtasgarh
 magar, yahaan bhi ve tik nahin paae or bombai ke prasiddh prakaashak seth gangavishnu khemraj ke aamantran par 1891 main bombai chale gaye
 When Gahmari ji was in Rohtasgarh, he used to send his compositions to newspapers and magazines
 bombai main jab rahane lage to vahaan bhi unki kalam gatisheel rahi
 It is another matter that they could not stay there for long
 chunki khemraj kaa vyavsaay pustakon ke prakaashan kaa tha, isliye vahaan unke liye rachanaatmakataa ke liye koi vishesh jagah nahin thi
 Papers and magazines were not published from there
 isliye, yahaan apane anukool avasaron ko na dekhakar vahaan se tyaagptr dekar kalakankar chale aae
 Gahmari ji was a regular writer of the daily 'hindosthan' originating from Kalankarkar
 iske saath hi us samay kii shreshth patr-patrikaayen 'bihar bandhu', 'bharat jivan', 'saar sudhanidhi' main bhi niyamit likhte the
 When Gahmari came to Kalakankar at the invitation of Raja Rampal Singh in 1892, he became associated with the editorial department here and stayed for a year
 yaheen par kaam karte hue bangla sikhi or anuwaad ke jariye sahitya ko samrudh karne kaa prayaas bhi kiya
 Gahmari ji did not last long in one place
 ek baar phir san 1893 main ve bombai kii ore unmukh hue or yahaan se nikalne vaale patr 'bombai vyapaar sindhu' kaa sampadan karne lage
 This letter was carried out by a fearless and infinitely courageous postman there
 lekin is patr kaa durbhaagya kahen yaa gahamri ji kaa ki yah patr chah maheene ke baad band ho gaya, lekin gahamri ji bekaar nahin hue
 At the same time, a Hindi lover SS Mishra called Ghamri ji and gave him the responsibility of editing 'bhasha Bhushan'
 yah patr masik tha
 But this letter also stopped
 lekin iske band hone ke peeche na aarthik kaaran the na anya duusari tarah kii prakashkeey samasyaayein
 Rather this letter had to be closed due to a riot
 'bhashaa bhushan' ke band hone ke baad nae thor kii talash main chal pade
 There was no dearth of those who loved them and loved them
 unheen main the pan balmunkud purohit
 With this grace, Gahmari ji turned to Mandla
 lekin yahaan bhi bahut dinon tak nahin rah sake
 The publication of the monthly 'guptakatha' started from here, but due to lack of meaning, this paper had to be stopped prematurely
 gahamriji ek baar phir chauraahey par aa gaye
 But this intersection led to a path leading to Bombay
 khemraj ji ne 'shri venkateshwar samachar' naam se patr kaa prakaashan shuru kar diya tha
 This paper became popular in a short time in the efficient editing of Gahmari ji
 isi dauraan prayag se nikalne vaale 'pradeep' main tribune ke sampadak nagendranath gupt kii ek jasusi kahani 'hiraar mulya' prakashit hui thi
 Gahamariji translated this story into Hindi and published it in several installments in Sri Venkateswara Samachar
 yah jasusi kahani pathakon ko itani ruchikar lagi ki kai pathakon ne is patr kii graahakta le lee
 At that time, there was a keen interest of readers in detective stories
 isamen rochakata or rahasy kii aisi katha gunfit hoti ki pathakon ke bheetar ek tarah kii jugupsa jagaati or padhgaye ko vivash
 Gahmari ji understood the minds and minds of the readers
 'heere kaa mol' ke anuwaad kii lokapriyata or 'joda jasoos' likhakar pathakon kii pratikriyaaon se ve avgat ho chuke the
 Due to this popularity, he started making many schemes
 ve yah bhi samaj chuke the ki jasusi dhang kii kahaniyon ke jariye hi pathakon kaa vishaal varg taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Gahmari ji turned towards spying writing with full preparation
 ullekhneey baat yah bhi he ki unke saath ghati kuch ghatnaon ne bhi jasusi dhang ke lekhan kii ore unhen dhakela
 Thus, in 1899, he wanted to come home and get the detective, but Balamukund Gupta's son was to be married and he went to his village Gurayani with the responsibility of editing 'bharat Mitra' to Ghamri ji
 kuch dinon tak gahamri ji ne 'bharat mitra' kaa kushalta purvak sampadan kiya
 Due to this, the publication of 'detective' was postponed for a short time
 unki ichha thi ki 'saraswati' ke saath hi 'jasoos' kaa bhi prakaashan ho, lekin yah ichha unke man main hi rah gai
 In this way, the spy was not published with 'saraswati' in January 1900, but four months later, in May 1900
 gahamri ji ne 'bharat mitra' ke sampadan ke dauraan jasoos ke nikalne kii soochna de di thi
 The advantage was that hundreds of readers subscribed to the magazine even before it was published
 ek or ullekhneey baat yah he ki hindi main 'jasoos' shabd ke prachlan kaa shrey gahamri ji ko hi jaataa he
 He wrote that 'before 1892 no word spies appeared in any book
 ' unhone apni patrika kaa namakaran aise kiya jisase aam pathak aasaani se uski vishay vastu ko samaj sake
 The word 'spy', however, suggests that it would have published detective stories, but that was not the case
 uske har ank main ek jasusi kahani ke alaava samachar, vichaar or pustakon kii samikshaayen bhi niyamit rup se chhapati thim
 He needed some money to get the detective, he fulfilled it by writing 'manorama' and 'mayavini'
 'jasoos' kaa pehla ank babu amir singh ke hariprakash press se chhapakar aayaa or pehle hi maheene main vipipi se paune do sau rupye kii prapti hui
 It had touched the summit, crossing all the limits of popularity with its inception
 isaki apaar lokapriyata ko dekhakar gopalram gahamri jab jasusi dhang kii kahaniyon or upanyaason ke lekhan kii ore pravrutt ho hue to phir peeche mudakar nahin dekha or na isaki parvaah kii ki sahitya ke tathakthith adhyeta unke bare main kya raay rakhte hai
 In his entry, the detective introduced something like this - is tarah yah patrika apni pathakon kii badaulat or unke apaar sneh ke kaaran ek do varsh nahin, puure 38 varsh tak gahammer jaise gaanv se nikalati rahi
 Just as Bal Krishna Bhatt kept 'hindi Pradeep' illuminated for 33 years while struggling with hunger, similarly Gopal Ram Gahmari kept it alive for 38 years
 is bich unhen ek baar phir bombai jane kaa avasar mila
 Venkateswara newspaper was coming out
 unhen sampadak kii jarurat thi
 Although at that time the editor of that paper was the famous writer Lajjaram Mehta ji
 unhen apane ghar bundi janaa tha
 Therefore the letter needed an editor
 gahamri ji unke bulaave par gaye or kaarybhara sambhala, lekin 'jasoos' band nahin hui
 She was constantly leaving
 is bich gahamri ji ke samaksh seth ranganath ne prastaav rakhaa ki jasoos unako de diya jaae or aajanm ru 50 bataur guzaara lete rahen
 Seth ji also proposed to him that there should be no desire to stay in Bombay, who should send and write from Gahmar itself, i will keep publishing
 lekin, gahamri ji ne is prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya or apane gaanv laut aae
 During this period, Gahmari ji moved from espionage to writing two books on spiritual matters
 'ichhashakti' unki bangala se anuvaadit rachana thi or 'mohini vidya', mismerism par anuthi or hindi main sambhavat: pehali rachana thi
 Both these books were well liked by Hindi readers
 baad ke dinon main jasusi lekhan se unki virakti bhi ho gai thi or ve dharm-aadhyatm kii ore mud gaye the
 Gahmari ji said that 'whose reader has read the novel and understood that all the truths are true, his writing should be considered successful
 ' gahamri ji apni rachanaaon main pathakon kii ruchi kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhte the ki ve kis tarah kii saamagree pasand karte hai
 In terms of literature, his views were also of high order
 ve sahitya ko bhi itihaas maanate the
 He believed that literature has a deep connection with the era in which it is composed
 ve upanyaas ko apane samay kaa itihaas maanate the
 Detectives, execution of innocents, marriage of Ketaki, Hum hawala, three spies, whirling blood, Than Than Gopal, Gerua Baba, 'death of the Dead', etc
 are not only mystery adventures, but also the accompaniments and inconsistencies of the era Are present
 samaaj kii dasha or disha kaa akalan bhi he
 Saying that they are espionage and only amusing compositions, their creations cannot be rejected, nor can their contributions be turned away
 gahamri ji kii baad kii peedi ko jo lokapriyata mili, uskaa bahut kuch shrey devakinandan khatri or gahamri ji ko hi jaataa he
 In his writings, he created conditions that people had moved towards studying
 gahamri ji ne akele saikadon kahaniyon, upanyaason k anuwaad kiye
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla praised Gopalram Gahmari's work in the history of his literature, but later critics ignored it
 gautam sanyaal ne hans ke ek visheshank main likhaa ki, 'premchand ke jis upanyaas ko pathneeyata kii drushti se sarvocch sthaan praapt he, us 'gaban' kii anek katha sthitiyaan ek videshi krime thriller se milti-julati hai or jiskaa anuwaad gopalram gahamri ne san 1906 main jasoos patrika main kar chuke the
 'there is no need to say more about Gopalram Ghamri from this quote

 pentium dul-kor brands kaa upyog intel ke menstream x86-sanrachana vaale microprocessron ke liye 2006 se 2009 tak kiya gaya tha jab ise nayaa naam pentium diya gaya
 The processors are based on either 32-bit Yonah or 64-bit merom-2m, Allendale and wolfdale-3m cores, which are designed to target mobile or desktop computers
 diye hue kaald aavruti main suvidhaon, mulya evam pradarshan ke anusaar, pentium dul-kor processron ko intel ke utpaada prakaaron main seleron ke upar kintu kor tathaa kor 2 ke neeche rakhaa gaya
 The Pentium was also a more popular choice for dual-core overclocking, as it can provide the best performance at a lower cost
 2006 main, intel ne pentium trademark ke bazaar se hatane ke baad single-kor vaale conro-l par aadhaarit lekin 1 mabibite cash ke kam-laagat vaale kor microarchitekchar processron ko sanrachanaatmak utpaada ke rup main bazaar main pun: laane ke yojana kii ghoshnaa kii

 a single-core conroe-l with 1 megabyte of cache was not considered capable enough to differentiate the planned pentiums with the celerons, so the dual-core CPU was replaced and the "dual-core" that category
 Added to sampoorn 2009 ke dauraan, intel ne apane prakashnon main naam ko pentium dul-kor se badalakar waapas pentium kar diya
 kuch processron ko donon naamon se bechaa gaya, lekin haal ke E5400 se E6800 desktop or SU4100 / T4x00 mobile procesar aadhikarik rup se pentium dul-kor shrenee kaa hissaa nahin the
 The first processor to use this brand appeared in notebook computers in early 2007
 Those processors, named the Pentium T2060, T2080 and T2130, had a 32-bit Pentium M-derived Yonah core, and were almost identical to the Core Duo T2050 except for the use of a 1 megabyte L2 cache instead of a 2 megabyte cache
 Was
 un sabhi teenon main 533 megahertz kaa ek FSB tha jo sipiu ko memory se jodta tha
 Intel developed the Pentium dual-core at the request of laptop manufacturers
 iske baad 3 june 2007 ko, intel ne desktop pentium dul-kor brands vaale processron ko jari kiya jinhen E2140 or E2160 ke rup main janaa gaya
 Later in September 2007 an E2180 model was released
 ye procesar intel 64 ekstansion kaa samarthan karte hai, jo haal ke 64-bit vaale kor microarchitekcharyukt alendel kor par aadhaarit hai
 They were almost identical to the Core 2 Duo E4300 processor except for the use of a 1 megabyte L2 cache in place of a 2 megabyte cache
 un donon main ek 800 megahertz kaa FSB tha
 They aimed at a cheaper market with Intel Celeron-above processors featuring only 512 kilobytes of L2 cache
 aise ek kadam ne pentium brands main ek parivartan laa diya or ise menstream / premium brands vaali apni purv kii sthiti ke bajaay sasti shrenee main hastantarit kar diya
ye sipiu overclock karne main atyadhik sakasham hai
 merom-2m, the mobile version of the Allendale processor, was also launched in 2007, featuring 1 megabyte L2 cache but only 533 MT / s FSB with T23xx processors
 bas clock ko baad main badha kar ek hi daai se bane hue T3xxx pentium processron ke liye 667 MT / s kar diya gaya
 The 45 nanometer E5200 model was released by Intel on August 31, 2008, with a 65 nanometer E21xx series with 2 megabytes of L2 cache and a clock speed of 2
5 ghz
 E5200 model overclock karne main atyadhik sakasham procesar bhi he, jisamen kuch atyadhik utsaahi model drav nitrogen prashithan kaa upyog karte hue 6 gigahertz tak kii kaald gati praapt kar lete hai

 The Penryn core is a successor to the 45 nanometer version of the Merom core and Intel's mobile range of Pentium dual-core microprocessors

 Intel released the first Penryn-based Pentium dual-core, T4200 in December 2008
 baad main, penrin par aadhaarit mobile pentium T4000, SU2000 or SU4000 processron ko bazaar main paintium ke rup main bechaa gaya
 In early 2010, the Pentium dual-core brand has been discontinued and replaced by the name Pentium
 desktop E6000 shrinkhalaa or oem-maatr mobile pentium SU2000 or baad ke sabhi modelon ko hameshaa pentium kaha jaataa tha, lekin desktop pentium dul-kor E2000 or E5000 shrinkhalaa vaale processron kaa naveen namakaran kiya janaa tha
 Although using the name Pentium, the desktop Pentium is based on a dual-core core microarchitecture, which can be clearly seen when comparing its characteristic feature to Pentium D, the first netburst microarchitecture used in Pentium 4
 based on
 2 yaa 4 mabibite ke saajha-l2-cash samarthit kor 2 duo, desktop pentium dul-kor main 1 yaa 2 mabibite kaa saajha L2 cash hota he
 In contrast, Pentium d processors have a non-shared L2 cache of either 2 or 4 megabytes

 a major difference between these processors is that desktop Pentium dual-core processors have a thermal design power of only 65 watts while in Pentium d it is between 95 and 130 watts
 hindi niabandh lekhanavaad-vivadvichaar goshteekavy goshtishruti lekhanhindi tankan pratiyogitakavi sammelanpuraskaar samaaroh Hindi day is celebrated every year on 14 September
 14 sitambar 1949 ko samvidhan sabha ne ek mat se yah nirnay liya ki hindi hi bharat kii rajbhasha hogi
 To propose the importance of this important decision and to propagate Hindi in every field, on the request of Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti, Wardha, on September 14, India is celebrated as hindi-day every year since 1953
 varsh 1918 main gandhi ji ne hindi sahitya sammelan main hindi bhashaa ko rashtrabhasha banane ko kaha tha
 Gandhiji also called it the language of the people
 swatantra bharat kii rajbhasha ke prashn par 14 sitambar 1949 ko kaaphi vichaar-vimarsh ke baad yah nirnay liya gaya jo bhartiya samvidhan ke bhaag 17 ke adhyay kii dhara 343 main is prakaar varnit he: This decision was taken on 14 September, due to which this day was considered as the best for Hindi Day
 haalanki jab rajbhasha ke rup main ise chunaa gaya or lagu kiya gaya to gaiyr-hindi bhashi rajya ke log iskaa virodh karne lage or angrezi ko bhi rajbhasha kaa darja dena padaa
 Due to this, English language started to influence in Hindi also
 hindi diwas ke dauraan kai kaarykram hote hai
 On this day, students are taught respect for Hindi and use of Hindi in daily practice etc
 jisamen hindi niabandh lekhan, vaad-vivaad hindi tankan pratiyogita aadi hota he
 Bhasha Samman has been introduced to inspire people towards Hindi on Hindi Day
 yah sammaan prativarsh desh ke aise vyaktitv ko diya jayega jisane jan-jan main hindi bhashaa ke prayog evam utthan ke liye vishesh yogadan diya he
 For this, one lakh one thousand rupees are given as honor
 hindi main niabandh lekhan pratiyogita ke dwaara kai jagah par hindi bhashaa ke vikaas or vistaar hetu kai suzav bhi praapt kiye jate hai
 But the next day all forget the Hindi language
 hindi bhashaa ko kuch or din yaad rakhen is kaaran rajbhasha saptaah kaa bhi aayojan hota he
 Due to which it remains for at least one week in a year
 bolne waalon kii sankhya ke anusaar angreji or chini bhashaa ke baad puure duniya main chauthi sabase badi bhashaa he
 But among those who understand it well, read and write this number is very less
 yah or bhi kam hoti ja rahi
 Along with this, English words have also had a great impact on the Hindi language and many words have been removed from circulation and the English word has taken its place
 jisase bhavishya main bhashaa ke vilupt hone kii bhi sambhaavna adhik bad gai he
 For this reason, people who have knowledge of Hindi or know Hindi language, this day is celebrated as Hindi Day to make them aware of their duty towards Hindi, so that all of them can perform their duty and make Hindi language future
 To save it from extinction
 lekin log or sarkaar donon hi iske liye udasin dikhti he
 Hindi lives as a maid in her home
 hindi ko aaj tak sanyukt raashtra sangh kii bhashaa nahin banaaya ja sakaa he
 It would be ironic to say that Yoga got the support of 177 countries, but what support cannot be gathered from 129 countries for Hindi? It has come such a situation that on the day of Hindi day, many people have to use words like speak in Hindi on Twitter
 amar ujaalaa ne bhi logon se vinati kiya ki kam se kam hindi diwas ke din hindi main twit karen
 Its main purpose is to make people aware of the fact that once a day in the year, Hindi language cannot develop until they use Hindi fully
 is ek din sabhi sarkari karyaalayon main angrezi ke sthaan par hindi kaa upyog karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Apart from this, one who does good development work in Hindi throughout the year and uses Hindi well in his work is awarded with the award
 kai log apane saamaanya bolchaal main bhi angrezi bhashaa ke shabdon kaa yaa angrezi kaa upyog karte hai, jisase dhire dhire hindi ke astitv ko khatra pahunch rahaa he
 Even today, the largest Hindi institution in the world, located in Varanasi, is in a very poor condition today
 is kaaran is din un sabhi se nivedan kiya jaataa he ki ve apane bolchaal kii bhashaa main bhi hindi kaa hi upyog karen
 Apart from this, people are also asked to write their thoughts etc
 in Hindi
 chunki hindi bhashaa main likhane hetu bahut kam upkaran ke bare main hi logon ko pataa he, is kaaran is din hindi bhashaa main likhane, jaanch karne or shabdkosh ke bare main jaankaree di jaati he
 There will be no significant benefit from working by some people for the development of Hindi language
 iske liye sabhi ko ek jute hokar hindi ke vikaas ko nae aayam tak pahunchaana hoga

 yah kila mysore ke sher, raja tipu sultan ke saahas or bahaduree kaa bhi pratik he, isliye ise tipu ke naam se joda jaataa he
 According to historians, the king of Palakkad was friendly to Zamorin, the ruler of Kozhikode
 18veen shatabdi ke armbh main unhone zamorin se alag hone kaa nirnay liya or swatantra ho gaye
 Zamorin then invaded Palakkad, who came to Hyder Ali to seek help to escape

 After this, it was also rebuilt by Hyder Ali in 1766
 1784 main gyaarah dinon ke yuddh ke baad kile ko karnal phularaton ke maatahat sena dwaara british adhikaar main le liya gaya
 The Zamorin troops from Kozhikode then invaded and took possession of the fort, but in 1790 the British recaptured it and rebuilt the fort again
 tipu sultan ne 1799 main angrejon ke saath ek muthbhed main veergati paayi or tabhi se uske naam par janaa jane laga
 The construction of the fort at Palakkad started with the cooperation of French engineers from 1757 -1764

 In 1783, the British led by British Colonel Fullerton attacked Tipu hard and took the fort back, although in this war also the fort suffered heavy damage
 kalikat ke raja zamorin ne bhi palakkad par apana adhikaar jamaane hetu hamale kiye or 1788 main punah ek baar tipu us kile ko angrejon se mukt karaane main safal hua, kintu alpakaal main hi karnal stuart ne 1790 main kile ko ek baar phir praapt kar liya or iske baad to angrejon ke aadhin hi rahaa
 The British used this fort for their military cantonment and became an important center for the campaigns against Tipu
 1792 main angrejon or tipu sultan ke bich lambe chal rahe yuddh ek sandhi ke tahat hua
 Accordingly, all the authorized areas of Malabar were transferred by Tipu to the British
 He got Palakkad Fort repaired in 1797
 tab bhi us kile ko tipu ke kile ke rup main hi janaa jaataa tha
 After the authority of the British, he was made a tehsildar's office and many government offices were started inside the fort

 anuvanshiki or rog main bahudhaa koi na koi sambandh rahata he
 Many diseases are caused by contaminated environment and conditions, but there are many diseases due to which there is a defect due to birth from parents
 e rog anuvanshik rog kehalaate hai
 There are some diseases that arise as a result of both genetics and environmental influences
 jeevon main nar ke shukranu tathaa stri kii andkoshika ke sanyog se santan kii utpatti hoti he
 Both the sperm and scrotum contain nucleus
 in cendrakasutron main sthit jin ke swabhavanusaar santan ke maansik tathaa shaareerik gun or dosha nishchit hote hai
 Because of one or a few genes being defective, only those defects occur in the child
 kuch dosha main se koi rog utpann nahin hota, keval santan kaa shaareerik sanghathan aisa hota he ki usamen vishesh prakaar ke rog sheeghra utpann hote hai
 Therefore, to know for sure whether the cause of the disease is heredity or adverse environment is not always feasible
 anuvanshik rogon kii sahi gananaa main anya kathinaaiyaan bhi hai
 For example; Many congenital diseases appear only when they are old
 duusari ore, kuch anuvanshik doshayukt bachche janm lete hi mar jate hai
 The disease is manifested in each generation due to their effect on the presence of antitussive pathogenic genes, but diseases caused by the degraded gene occur spontaneously in any offspring of the offspring, as evident by Mendel's hereditary rules
 kuch rog ladakiyon se kahin adhik sankhya main ladakon main paae jate hai
 Many examples of genetic diseases can be given
 inamen se kuch nimnlikhit hai : Cataract, hyperpigmentation, glaucoma, long-sightedness, etc
, occur due to defect of anticonvulsant gene
 tirohit jin ke kaaran vivarnataa, astigmatism, keratoconus, ityadi rog utpann hote hai
 Sexually transmitted genital diseases, which are more prevalent in men, are diseases like blindness, night blindness, night blindness etc
 inamen ek sau se adhik anuvanshik rogon kii gananaa kii gai he
 Among these are psoriasis, ichthiasis, keratosis, etc
 adhikangulata, yuktangulata, kai prakaar kabonapan, asthiyon kaa uchit reeti se na viksit hona, janm se hi nitambasthi kaa ukhda rahanaa ityadi Haemophilia, special types of anemia etc
 madhumeh, gathiya, chehre kaa vikrut tathaa bhayaavah ho janaa ityadi
 Heredity, epilepsy, hypnosis may also be the cause of heredity
 vividh rog, jaise bahraapan, goongaapan, kataa hont, videern taalu aadi bhi anuvanshikta se prabhavit hote hai
 Apart from this, heredity causes inclination towards diseases like esophagus, high blood pressure, cancer etc
 pakad vah chota sa swar samudaay he jise gane-bajaane se kisi raag vishesh kaa bodh ho jaye

 Consolidation is the method by which individual farming is prevented and stored in pieces and the entire land of a village and the scattered landmasses of farmers are redistributed into a separate area
 bharat main jahaan prayek vyaktigat bhoomi vaise hi nunatam he, vahaan kabhi kabhi khet itane chote ho jate hai ki kaaryaksham kheti karne main bhi baadha padati he
 The consolidation of the checks is done by consolidation, which simplifies farming practices for the farmer and makes it easier to monitor the chuck along with saving wages and time
 iske dwaara us bhoomi kii bhi bachat ho jaati he jo bikhare hue kheton kii medon se ghir jaati he
 Finally, there is also an opportunity that the village habitats, roads and roads can be planned and improved
 chakbandi kaa kaary sarvapratham prayogic rup se san 1920 main punjab main prarambh kiya gaya tha
 Cooperative societies were formed under government protection, so that the consolidation work could be done on voluntary basis
 prayog saamaanya: safal rahaa, kintu yah aavashyak samajha gaya ki punjab chakbandi kanoon 1936 main paas kiya jaay, jiske dwaara adhikariyon ko yojana tathaa kaashtkaaron ke matbhedon kaa nirnay karne kaa adhikaar praapt ho jaay
 In 1928, the "royal Commission on Agriculture in India", which did not have the right to make any changes in the ownership of the land, recommended that consolidation be adopted in other provinces as well
 parantu kendriya praanton or punjab ke atirikt, jahaan kuch simit safalataa ke saath chakbandi kaary hua, anya praanton main bahut kam safalataa praapt hui

 The government was empowered by a legislation passed in Bombay for the first time in 1947 to implement the consolidation work, where it considers appropriate
 jin praanton ne is pratha kaa paalan kiya usamen punjab, uttar pradesh, pan bengal, bihar tathaa hyderabad shaamil hai
 The provincial governments received much encouragement from the central government

 The developed charge of the consolidation program can be gauged from the fact that where India's total consolidation area was 110
09 lakh acres by the end of March 1956, it increased to 230
19 lakh acres by the end of March 1960 and at the same time 131
87 lakh acres
 But consolidation work was going on
 kintu vibhinn praanton main ye kaam asantulit dhang se ho rahaa tha
 In March 1960, more than half of the consolidated area was located in the Punjab province, while the consolidation area in the major provinces - Andhra, Madras, Bengal and Bihar was either zero or negligible

 Therefore, in some provinces, for example in Uttar Pradesh, special rules have been made to prevent the consolidated area from being consumed, sold and transferred
 kintu anya praanton jaise punjab main abhi yah niyam nahin lagu kiye gaye hai tathaa kuch prantan ne abhi tak isapar vidhiwat vichaar bhi nahin kiya he 
 Compact holdings: During the consolidation process, scattered holdings of farmers are collected in one place, this has reduced the number of checks, which has facilitated agricultural operations

 Availability of land for public use such as population, school, hospital, etc
