 The language is slowly starting to lose its ground in Manipur against the vast majority of the Maitai sect and against the vast majority of Bengali speakers in Cachar and Bangladesh is slowly experiencing its decay

 This language is known to its speakers as Eamar Thar, which means "my mother's language
 " ve khud ko or unki bhashaa manipuri kehete hai, or bishnupriya shabd ko manipur ke anya jaateey samoohon se alag karne ke liye upyog karte hai
 The word Bishnupriya is probably derived from Bishnupur, with the suffix -ya, which means "the people of Bishnupur"
 Bishnupriya Manipuri holds that the language was passed to Manipur by some immigrants from Dwarka and Hastinapura soon after the Mahabharata war
 
 aage yah kaha gaya he ki in apravasiyon kaa netritv chitrarangada or arjuna ke putr babruvahan or tritiy pandav ne kiya tha
 Some scholars and history writers have supported the ancient Manipur origin of the Mahabharata period of Bishnupriya Manipuri by observing the morphology, vibronic, and phonology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language
 Bishnupriya Manipuri believes that his language is strongly influenced by Sanskrit and Maharashtra as well as Sauraseni nature

 antigua or barbuda ke governor-general yani maharajyapal, antigua or barbuda kii rani ke nivasiy sthaneey rajpratinidhi kaa pad he
 The governor-general carries out his constitutional functions in the absence of the Queen of Antigua and Barbuda, who are the governing kings and national heads of a total of 16 tribes, including Antigua and Barbuda and the United Kingdom
 antigua or barbuda samet lagbhag saare rashtramandal prajabhumiyon main, governor-general kii niyukti maharani dwaara, sambandhit prajabhumi ke pradhanmantri ke salaah par hoti he
 However, there are some tribes where the governor-general is elected by majority vote by the National Parliament
 antigua or barbuda main governor-general ko shaasha dwaara, pradhanmantri kii salaah par niyukt kiya jaataa he
 Antigua and Barbuda is theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of Antigua and Barbuda is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all the constitutional powers of the governor, as his representative, the governor-general of Antigua and Barbuda

 Being a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions

 In addition, the governor-general, as the Queen's representative, also carries out several official functions of the head of state, for example: appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister and other ministers, convening and terminating Parliament and announcing new elections

 pali pracheen uttar bharat ke logon kii bhashaa thi
 It was spoken from Bihar in the east to haryana-rajasthan in the west and nepal-uttar Pradesh in the north to Madhya Pradesh in the south
 bhagwaan buddha bhi inhen pradesho main viharan karte hue logon ko dharm samajhaate rahe
 Today Hindi is spoken in these regions
 isliye, paali pracheen hindi he
 It is a dialect or Prakrit in the indo-european language family
 isko buddha tripitak kii bhashaa ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Pali was written in the scripts of the Brahmi family
 pali shabd kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke naanaa mat paae jate hai
 Some have tried to generate it from the word text and some from the pyad
 ek german vidvan maiks vailaser ne pali ko 'patli' kaa sankshipt rup bataakar yah mat vyakt kiya he ki uskaa arth patliputra kii pracheen bhashaa se he
 One of the two opinions that scholars have more inclination towards than these derivatives, is the opinion of Pt
 Vidushekhar Bhattacharya, according to which the word Pali is derived from the line
 is mat kaa prabal samarthan ek pracheen pali kosh abhidhanppadipika se hota he, kyonki usamen tanti, buddhavachan, panti or pali in shabdon me bhi spasht hi pali kaa arth pankti hi he
 The usage of Pali found in the above two meanings also proves meaningful in this sense
 buddhavachanon kii pankti yaa paath kii pankti kaa arth buddhaghosh ke prayogon main baith jaataa he
 However, according to phonology, derivation of Pali cannot be derived from the word line
 uski apeksha pankti ke arth main prachlit deshi shabd pali, paathth, padu se hi is shabd kaa sabandh jodna adhik upyukt prathit hota he
 The word Pali is also found to be prevalent in Sanskrit
 abhidhanppadipika main jo pali kii vyutpatti "paaleti rakkhtiti pali", is prakaar batalaai gai he usase bhi is mat kaa samarthan hota he
 But the monk Jagdish Kashyapa, the doer of "pali Mahavikaran", has raised some objections about taking Pali in the sense of line and has tried to explain it derived from the word 'pariyya' used in many places in the original Tripitaka texts
 samrat ashok ke bhabru shilaalekh main tripitak ke 'dhammpariyaay' shabd sthaan par magadhi pravriti ke anusaar 'dhamm paliyaay' shabd kaa prayog paaya jaataa he, jiskaa arth buddha-upadesh yaa vachan hota he
 According to Kashyap Ji, Pali was derived from this palyaan refuge
 mul tripitak main bhashaa kaa kahin koi naam nahin miltaa
 But Buddhaghosha etc
 Acharyas have called the language of Buddha's teachings as Magadhi
 visuddhimagg evam mahavans main is magadhi ko sab praaniyon kii mulbhasha kaha gaya he
 The use of the word Pali is not usually found before the 14th century AD
 haan, buddhaghosh ne apni atthakathaon main pali shabd kaa prayog kiya he, kintu yah bhashaa ke arth main nahin, buddhavachan athwa mooltripitak ke paath ke arth main kiya he or vah bhi praaia: us paath ko atthkatha se bhinn dikhalaane ke liye
 Thus somewhere he has said that its policy is like this, but it is so in the story, or it is neither in the policy nor in the story
 buddhaghosh ke samay se kuch purv likhe gaye dipawans main tathaa unke pashchaatkaaleen mahavans aadi rachanaaon main bhi pali shabd kaa inhen do arthon main prayog kiya gaya paaya jaataa he
 With the same meaning, the word Pali started being used for that literature and its language respectively
 bhashaa kii drushti se pali us madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha kaa ek rup he jiskaa vikaas lagbhag i
pus
 chhathi shatee se mana jaataa he
 Prior to that, the form of the ancient Indian Aryabhasha is found in the Vedas and the Brahmins, Upanishads and texts of Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc
, which are called 'vedic language' and 'sanskrit language'
 vaidic bhashaa evam sanskrit kii apeksha madhyakaalin bhashaaon kaa bhed pramukhataa se nimna baton main paaya jaataa he : Grammatically ye visheshtaayen madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha ke saamaanya lakshan hai or desh kii un lokbhashaon main paae jate hai jinka suprachaar ukt avadhi se koi do hajaar varsh tak rahaa or jinka bahut-sa sahitya bhi uplabdh he
 Apart from the above general characteristics, there are many differences in these languages as compared to their country and time
 kaal kii drushti se unke teen str maane gaye hai - The languages of all these eras have been given a common name Prakrit
 iske pratham str ko bhashaaon kaa swaroop ashok kii prashastiyon tathaa pali sahitya main praapt hota he
 Among the second level languages are Magadhi, Ardhamagadhi, Shaurseni and Maharashtri Prakrit languages whose rich literature is available
 tritiy str kii bhashaaon ko apbhransh ev avahatth naam die gaye hai
 The earliest introduction to the distinction of medieval languages is found in the scriptures of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka
 inamen teen pradeshbhed spasht hai - purvi, pashchimi or pashchimottaree
 The form of the Eastern language appears in the commendations of Dhauli and Jaugarh
 inamen r ke sthaan par l tathaa aakarant shabdon ke kartakarak ekvachan kii vibhakti e supratishthit he
 The grammar of Prakrit has counted these tendencies in the characteristic features of the Magadhi Prakrit
 vaiyakarnon ke matanusaar is magadhi praakrit kaa teesraa vishesh lakshan teenon ooshm varnon ke sthaan par sh kaa prayog he
 But this trend is not found in the above articles of Ashoka, because in place of all the three heaters it is used here
 isi kaaran ashok kii is purvi praakrit ko magadhi na kahkar ardhamagadhi kaa pracheen rup kahana adhik upyukt he
 Girnar commendations are among those representing the Western language distinction
 inamen r or l kaa bhed surakshit he
 Sc is used in place of thermodynamics and the causative factor ends in the singular form o
 in pravritiyon se spasht he ki yah bhashaa shauraseni kaa pracheen rup he
 The form of the Northwestern language appears in the commendations of Shahbazgarhi and Mansera
 inamen praaia: sh, sh, s ye teenon ooshm varna apane sthaan par surakshit hai
 Some obsessions are visible at some places
 rakaryukt sanyuktavarna bhi dikhaai dete hai, tathaa jna or nya ke sthaan par ranna, kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 These trends indicate that language is an earlier form of paischi prakrit
 pali tripitak kaa kuch bhaag avashya hi ashok ke kaal main saahitiyik rup dhaaran kar chukaa tha kyonki uske lahulovad, moneysutt aadi saat prakarnon kaa ullekh unki bhabru kii prashasti main hua he
 But in the language of available literature, the language related features of Ashoka's eastern inscription are often lacking
 vyapak rup se pali bhashaa kaa swaroop girnaar prashasti kii bhashaa se sarvaadhik mail khaataa he or isi kaaran pali mulat: purvadeshiy nahin, kintu madhyadeshiy he
 The feature that makes Pali the first level of medieval Indian Aryan Bhasha, not the second, is the lack of intermediate decadent consonants and the order of h in place of Mahaprana Varna
 ye pravritiyaan dwitiya str kii bhashaaon ke saamaanya lakshan hai
 Yes, somewhere in place of the negative characters such as the name of the dark characters, etc
 appears
 kintu yah ek to alpamaatra main hi he or duusare vah pratham str kii ukt maryaada ke bheetar apekshaakrit pashchaatkaal kii pravriti kaa dyotak he
 With regard to the Pali language and the medieval Indian Aryan languages, it is important to note that the Sanskrit language which is believed to be from Sanskrit is not correct
 yatharthat: vedikakaal se hi saahitiyik bhashaa ke saath saath usase milti julati lokbhasha ne desh evam kalbhedanusaar saahitiyik praakrit bhashaaon kaa rup dhaaran kiya he
 Pali is also not taking its entire heritage from Sanskrit, because its word forms are found in such a way that it does not match Sanskrit but with the language of the Vedas
 udaahranarth- pali evam anya prakriton main tritiya bahuvachan ke deverbhi, devehi, jaise rup milte hai
 Such forms of non-formative nouns are completely lacking in Sanskrit, but Devearbhi in Vedic is as well-known as Devaैī
 atev ukt rup kii parampara pali tathaa prakriton main vaidic bhashaa se hi udbhoot maani ja sakati he
 Similarly, in Pali, 'yamamase', 'masre', 'katwe', etc
 are many forms whose suffixes are not found in Sanskrit, but are present in Vedic language
 pali ke granthon tathaa ashok kii prashastiyon se purv kaa praakrit main likhit sahitya uplabdh nahin he tathaa praakrit vaiyakarnon ne apni suvidha ke liye sanskrit ko prakruti maanakar praakrit bhashaa kaa vyakarnatmak vishleshan kiya he or isiilie yah bhranti utpann ho gai he ki praakrit bhashaaon kii utpatti sanskrit se hui
 This flaw is not found in Pali's Kachchan, Moggallan etc
 grammar, because Sanskrit was not described as a standard of nature

 lager ek aisa yantra he jo prerit utsarjan ek prakriya ke madhyam se prakaash utsarjit karata he
 The term laser is the acronym for radiation by induced emission of light amplification
 lager prakaash aamtaur par aakashik rup se shashakt, hote hai, jiskaa arth he ki prakaash yaa to ek sankare, nimna pravaahit kiran ke rup main niklegi, yaa use dekhne vaale yantron jaise lens lainson kii madad se ek kar diya jayega
 Typically, laser refers to the light emanating from a narrow wavelength lighthouse
 yah arth sabhi lejaron ke liye sahi nahin he, haalanki kuch lager vyapak prakashpunj kii tarah prakaash utsarjit karte hai, jabaki kuch kai prakaar ke vishisht tarangadairghy par saath saath prakaash utsarjit karte hai
 The emission of the conventional laser has a specific concentration
 prakaash ke adhiktar anya strot asangat prakaash utsarjit karte hai jinamein vibhinn charan hote hai or jo samay or sthaan ke saath nirantar badalata rahata he
 The term laser originated as an abbreviation for the emission of radiation induced by light amplification
 The word light in this sentence has a wider meaning, it does not refer only to the electromagnetic radiation of a visible light
 Therefore infrared laser, ultraviolet laser x -ray lasers, etc
 are light, microsomes equivalent to lasers, Messer, was first developed, Ace Equipment i ancient literature that emit microwaves and radio frequencies are called M, particularly from researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories, the laser was often called optical maser
 lekin is shabd kaa prayog ab chalan main nahin he or 1998 se bel prayogshaala bhi leisure shabd kaa prayog karti he
 The reconstructed verb laser means "generating a laser beam" or "applying laser light to an object"
 Sometimes the term "laser" is used to describe other optical techniques
 For example, uncomplicated state The source of the molecules in is called a "molecule laser"
 lager ek atyadhik paravartak taliya chhidr ke andar laabh madhyam se bana hota he, saath hi isamen laabh madhyam ko urja pradaan karne kaa madhyam bhi hota he
 The gain medium is a material with properties that allow light amplification by induced emission
 iske saralatam rup main, ek chhidr main do darpanon kii aisi vyavastha hoti he jisamen har baar laabh madhyam se guzarate hue prakaash aage peeche uchhalati rahati he
 One of the two mirrors in particular, the coupler produced, is partially transparent
 utpaadit lesar kiran is darpan ke madhyam se utsarjit hoti he
 Light with a specific wavelength that passes through the gain medium is amplified; Surround mirrors ensure that most light passes through the gain medium multiple times, to be amplified repeatedly
 prakaash kaa vah bhaag jo darpan ke bich main rahata he vah aanshik rup se paardarshee darpan se gujarata he or prakaash kii kiran ke rup main batch ke nikalataa he
 The process of supplying the energy required for amplification is called pumping
 khaas taur par yah urja bidyut dhara ke rup main yaa vibhinn tarangadairghy ke prakaash ke rup main aapurti kii jaati he
 Such light can be provided by a glowing lamp or another laser
 adhikansh vyaavhaarik lesron main atirikt tatv shaamil hote hai jo unke gunon jaise utsarjit prakaash kaa tarangadairya or kiran kaa aakaar ko prabhavit karte hai
 The gain medium of a laser is a material with controlled purity, size, concentration, which amplifies the beam through the process of induced emission
 yah kisi bhi avasthaa main ho saktaa he: gas, taral, thos yaa plasma 
yah laabh madhyam badhaaye gaye urja ko avashoshit karti he, jo kuch electronon ko ucch urja main badhaati he ") pramaatra avasthaa i photons ko sokhkar yaa photons utsarjit karke kan prakaash ke saath ghul mil sakate hai
 Emissions may be spontaneous or induced
 baad ke maamle main, photone usee disha main utsarjit hota he jis disha se prakaash gujarata he
 When the number of particles in an excited state exceeds the number of particles in some low energy state, the population is degraded and the induced emission speed due to light passing through it exceeds the amount of light absorption I
 Eventually, light is amplified
 apane aap se, yah ek prakaashik pravardhak banaata he jab ek prakaashik pravardhak ko ek anukampanyukt taliya guha ke andar rakhaa jaataa he, to isse leisure praapt
hota he The light generated by the induced emission is similar to the wavelength of the internal signals, in terms of phase and polarization
 It gives laser light its compatibility characteristic and allows it to maintain a uniform polarization and often establishes a characterization by the polar cavity design

 Although this fact of laser was discovered with the help of quantum physics, it is basically no more quantum mechanics than other light sources
 The action of free electron lasers can also be described without reference to quantum mechanics

 However, if this energy is available for a long time, then the temperature gets scattered in bulk in small amounts and less material evaporates
 There are many ways to achieve this
 ek kyuu-switch vaale lager main, jansankhya hraas ke nirmaan kii anumati lager ke liye chhidr kii paristhitiyon ko ke pratikul banaakar taiyaar kii jaati he
 When the energy pumped into the energy laser medium is stored at the desired level, the 'Q' is adjusted under favorable conditions, leaving the pulsation
 This results in higher powers, such as the average power of this laser over a shorter time period

 Another method of obtaining the pulsed laser method is to pump a laser material that has a source that is pulsed by itself, either a case of a glowing lamp when the electron is absorbed, or another laser that is already Pulsed
 Historically pulsed pumping was used in dye lasers where the inverse population life of a dye molecule was so short that it had a high energy content
 a power pump was required
 To overcome this problem, a large capacitor is charged and then discharged through a glowing lamp, which pumps a glow beam like a wide beam
 spandit pumping bhi un lezaron ke liye aavashyak he jo lager prakriya ke dauraan laabh madhyam ko itnaa baadhit karti he ki lager utpaadan ek choti avadhi ke liye ruk jaataa he i

 The first functionalized laser was demonstrated on 16 May 1960 by Theodore Memon to Hughes Research Laboratory
 Since then, lasers have become a billion-dollar market
 Lasers are by far the largest single-use optical storage device in devices such as compact discs and DVD players, with semiconductor lasers less than a millimeter wide
 Are on the surface
 Fiber optical communication is the second largest device
 Other laser devices are bar code readers, laser printers and laser pointers

 As the idea developed, the focus shifted from infrared frequencies to more visible light instead
 This concept was originally a " Was referred to as "optical moser
" One year later, Bell Laboratory proposed a monopoly application for the proposed optical moser
 Did i Schawlow and Townes sent a manuscript physical review of theoretical calculations, which was published the same year his paper
 
 In those days Gordon Gould, a graduate student at Columbia University, was working on a doctoral research paper on the energy levels of excited thallium
 Gould and Towns met on the general topic of radiation emissions
 In November 1957, Gould called the "laser" Wrote your thoughts related to the suggestion of using an open resonator which is an important component for future lasers

 He continued to work on his idea and filed a patent application in April 1959
 The US Patent Office rejected his application and This patent was given to Bell Laboratory in 1960
 It sparked a legal battle that lasted for 28 years and brought scientific prestige and more money
 And i Goold won his first short patent in 1977, but could not claim his first patent victory until 1987, until a federal judge issued him a patent for optically pumped lasers and gas-fired lasers

 shukdev mahabharat kaal ke muni the
 He was the son of Ved Vyas ji
 ve bachapane main hi gyaan prapti ke liye van main chale gayi the
 It was he who told Shrimad Bhagwat Purana to Parikshit
 shuk dev ji ne vyas ji se mahabharat bhi padhaa tha or use devataao ko sunaaya tha
 These sages had become Brahmin in a short state
 shukdev ke janm ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki ye maharishi veda vyas ke ayonij putr the or yah baarah varsh tak mata ke garbh main rahe
 The story goes like this
 bhagwaan shiv, parvati ko amar katha suna rahe the
 Parvati ji fell asleep while listening to the story and a shuk sitting there in her place started filling the hymn
 jab bhagwaan shiv ko yah baat gyaat hui, tab unhone shuk ko maarane ke liye daude or uske peeche apana trishul choda
 Shuk kept running in all the three worlds to save his life, while running, he came to Vyas ji's ashram and made a subtle appearance and entered his wife's mouth
 vah unke garbh main rah gaya
 It is said that they did not come out of the womb for twelve years
 jab bhagwaan shrikrishna ne swayan aakar inhen aashwaasan diya ki baahar nikalne par tumhaare upar maaya kaa prabhaav nahin padegaa, tabhi ye garbh se baahar nikle or vyasaji ke putr kahalaaye
 In the womb itself, he had perfect knowledge of Vedas, Upanishads, Darshan and Purana etc
 janm lete hi ye balya avasthaa main hi tap hetu van kii ore bhaage, aisi unki sansar se virakt bhavanaaen thi
 But weeping after the euphoria, Shri Vyas ji also ran after him
 maarg main ek jalashay main kuch kanyaayein snaan kar rahi thim, unhone jab shukdev ji maharaj ko dekha to apni avasthaa kaa dhyaan na rakh kar shukdev ji kaa aashirwad liya
 But when Mr
 Vyas, who was in a fascination behind Shukdev, reached there, all the girls hid
 aisi sansaarik virakti se shukdev ji maharaj ne tap prarambh kiya
 The place where Shukdev Ji Maharaj was Brahmalin is presently in the village of Sajuma, Kaithal in Haryana

 Policemen are very strict with him so that he can tell the truth, but Jamal is adamant that he did not cheat
 The film's story goes into Jamal's premonition and the audience automatically gets a one-question answer
 sho ke sanchaalak ne jo-jo prashn kiye, un sabon ke uttar kahin na kahin uske jivan se jude hote hai
 In those parts of Jamal's life, Amitabh's signature is taken, his mother killed during the hindu-muslim riots in the slum, his friendship with an orphan girl named Latika
 Jamal goes to school briefly and names his brother Athos, his name Parthose, and Latika's third Musketeers on the three characters in his beloved book, The Three Musketeers

 Eventually Jamal goes to Mumbai and insists on finding Latika

 He also takes Latika with him
 jab javed iskaa virodh karata he to saleem use maarane kii dhamkee detaa he
 Latika prevents him from doing so
 vah saleem ko bataati he to vah jamaal se prem karti he
 Saying this, hurts Salim's heart and breaks him
 baad ke dinon main jamaal ek kol centre main chaay bachane lagata he or chywala ke naam se mashhoor ho jaataa he
 One day a worker there asks to sit there for a while, then he searches the names Latika and Salim in the computer's data base
 vah saleem ke sampark main aa jaataa he, us samay tak saleem, javed ke gang kaa vishwasaneey gangester ban jaataa he
 One day Salim calls Jamal to Javed's house near him

 police poochtacha ke dauraan jamaal ko kaaphi pratadit karti he, yah jaanane ke liye ki jhuggi main rahane vaala ek ladkaa itane jatil sawaalon kaa sahi jawaab kaise de diya
 police ke sawaalon ke jawaab main saleem apane jivan kii kahani kahata he or bataata he ki sho main puch gaye sawaal kahin na kahin uski jindagi se jude hue hai
 After knowing the truth, the policemen again allow him to go on the show
 idhar, latikaa saleem ke ghar par tivi sho dekh rahi he, jahaan jamaal sho ke antim sawaal kaa jawaab dene vaala he
 When Jamal uses the phone option of a friend for his last question, the phone picks up, but the answer to his question is not known
 lekin jamaal vikalpon main se sahi uttar dhundne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he
 He names the third musketeers as Armij and wins a show of two crores
 udhar, saleem latikaa ko vahaan se bhaga detaa he or khud javed kii goli se maaraa jaataa he
 The next night Jamal and Latika meet at the station

 Bajirao II was the eighth and last Peshwa
 vah raghunatharav kaa putr tha
 Bajirao II always hated his Prime Minister Nana Fadnavis
 naanaa fadanvis kii mrityu ke baad vah swayan hi maratha samrajya kii satta sambhaalanaa chahta tha
 Bajirao II was a queer and treacherous man, who obtained the rank of Peshwa with the help of the British
 parantu angrezon ke saath bhi vah sachcha siddh nahin hua
 Due to his deception and dishonesty, the British sent him captive to Bithoor, where he died in 1853 AD
 bajirao dwitiya ne angrezon se mitrataa karke unki sahaayta se 'peshwa' kaa pad praapt kiya tha or uske liye kai maratha kshetra angrezon ko de diye

 Bajirao II supported Shinde, but Holkar's army defeated the combined forces of both of them

 In return, the Peshwa agreed to give so much Maratha territory to the company, which brought the expenses of the company's army
 usne yah bhi vaayada kiya ki vah apane yahan angrezon se shatruta rakhane vaale anya europea desh ke logon ko naukari par nahin rakhega
 Thus, Bajirao II sold his freedom to the British for his protection
 maratha saradaaron ne basai kii sandhi ke prati apana rosh prakat kiya, kyonki unhen laga ki peshwa ne apni kaayarata ke kaaran un sabhi kii swatantraaa bech di he
 So they prepared for war to end this objectionable treaty
 parinamswaroop dwitiya angl-maratha yuddh hua, jisamen angrezon kii jeet hui or maratha kshetron par unki prabhusatta sthapit ho gai
 Peshwa Bajirao did not like the restrictions imposed by the treaty
 usne maratha saradaaron main vyaapt rosh or asantosh kaa faaydaa uthaakar unhen angrezon ke viruddh dubaara sangathit kiya
 In November 1817, the organized Maratha army under the leadership of Bajirao II looted the 'english Residency' of Poona and attacked the English army at Khadki position, but was defeated

 He tried to escape, but on 3 June 1818, he had to surrender to the British
 angrezon ne is baar peshwa kaa pad hi samaapt kar diya or bajirao dwitiya ko apdasth karke bandi ke rup main kanpur ke nikat bithur bhej diya jahaan 1853 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
