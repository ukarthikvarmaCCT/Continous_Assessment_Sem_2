 Later, when the Baramandal Chand kingdom was formed, Almora town was established at this central place in 1568 by Kalyan Chand
 kalyaan chand dwaara
 In the time of the Chand kings, it was called Rajpur
 'raajpur' naam kaa bahut si pracheen taanbe kii platon par bhi ullekh mila he
 Uma, the daughter of Anisar Daksha Prajapati of a legend, was married to Shiva
 shiv ko daksh prajapati pasand nahin karte the, parantu yah devataaon ke aagrah ko taal nahin sakate the, isliye unhone apni putree kaa vivaah na chaahate hue bhi shiv ke saath kar diya tha
 Once Daksha Prajapati called all the gods in a yagna, but did not even give the invitation to his son-in-law Shiva and daughter Uma
 uma hath kar is yajna main pahaunchi
 She became very sad when she saw her father's yagna in Haridwar in the yagna of her father honoring all the gods and being her husband and her humiliation
 yajna ke havankund main yah kehete hue kud padi ki 'main agle janm main bhi shiv ko hi apana pati banaaungi
 As a result of the humiliation of myself and my husband - i burn my sacrificial fire in the Havan Kund of the Yagya
 ' jab shiv ko yah gyaat hua ki uma sati ho gayi, to unke krodh kaa parawar na rahaa
 He destroyed and corrupted the Yajna of Daksha Prajapati through his Ganas
 sabhi devi - devtaa shiv ke is raudra - rup ko dekhakar soch main pad gaye ki shiv pralay na kar daalen
 Therefore the Gods and Goddesses prayed to Mahadev Shiva and pacified his anger
 daksh prajapati ne bhi kshamaa maangi
 Shiva also blessed them
 parantu, sati ke jaale hue sharir ko dekhakar unka vairaygy umad padaa
 He started traveling in the sky by putting Sati's burnt body on the shoulder
 aisi sthiti main jahaan - jahaan par sharir ke ang kire, vahaan - vahaan par shakti peeth ho gaye
 Where Sati's Nayan fell; At the same time, Uma means Nanda Devi in the form of Naina Devi
 aaj kaa nainital vahi sthaan he, jahaan par us devi ke nain gire the

 Fish and snail fossils have been found in a village near here, indicating that the area of pithoragarh must have been a huge lake before the creation of the Himalayas
 haal-philhal tak pithauragarh main khaas vansh kaa shashan rahaa he, jinhen yahaan ke kile yaa koton ke nirmaan kaa shrey jaataa he
 There are four coats of Pithoragarh, which are Bhatkot, Dungarkot, Udaykot and Unchakot
 khaas vansh ke baad yahaan kachudi vansh kaa shashan hua tathaa is vansh kaa raja ashok malla, balban kaa samakaleen tha
 During this period, Pithoragarh was established by King Pithora and Pithoragarh was also named after him
 is vansh ke teen raajaaon ne pithauragarh se hi shashan kiya tathaa nikat ke gaanv khatkot main unke dwaara nirmit into ke kile ko varsh 1560 main pithauragarh ke tatkaaleen jiladhish ne dhwast kar diya
 From 1622 onwards Pithoragarh was ruled by the Chand dynasty
 pithauragarh ke itihaas kaa ek anya vivaadaaspad varnan he
 According to Atkins, Pir Gosai, a feudal of the Chand dynasty, founded Pithoragarh

 During his reign, Piru or Prithvi Gosain built a fort here named Pithoragarh
 kile ke naam par hi baad main iskaa naam pithauragarh hua
 The Chandas extended their authority over most of Kumaon where they ruled until the year 1790
 unhone kai kabeelon ko parrast kiya tathaa padosi raajaaon se yuddh bhi kiya taaki unki sthiti sudrudh ho jaay
 In the year 1790, the Gorkhas called Gorakhiyali ended the rule of the Chand dynasty by occupying Kumaon
 varsh 1815 main gorkha shaskaon ke shoshan kaa ant ho gaya jab east india company ne unhen parrast kar kumaun par apana aadhipaty sthapit kar liya
 According to Atkins, the total population of Pithoragarh in the year 1881 was 552

 In the year 1997, a new district Champawat was carved out by cutting some parts of Pithoragarh and its border was reestablished
 varsh 2000 main pithauragarh naye rajya uttrakhand kaa ek bhaag ban gaya
 Tehri and Garhwal are named after this district by combining two different names
 jahaan tehri bana he shabd ‘trihari’ se, jiskaa arth he ek aisa sthaan jo teen prakaar ke paap dho detaa he vahiin doosraa shabd bana he ‘garh’ se, jiskaa matlab hota he kila
 Prior to 888, the entire Garhwal region was divided into smaller 'strongholds', in which different kings ruled, known as 'rana', 'rai' or 'thakur'
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki malwa ke rajkumaar kanakapaal ek baar badrinaath ji ke darshan ko gayi jahaan wo parakramee raja bhanu pratap se mili
 King Bhanu Pratap was very impressed by them and got his only daughter married to Kanakpal as well as gave him his kingdom
 dhire-dhire kanakapaal or unki aane vaali peediyaan ek-ek kar saare garh jeet kar apana rajya badaati gayin
 Thus by 1803, the entire Garhwal region came under their control
 unhi varshon main gorkhaon ke asafal hamale bhi hote rahe, lekin san 1803 main aakhir dehradun kii ek ladaai main gorkhaon kii vijay hui jisamen raja pradvamun shah maare gayi
 But his Shahzade, who was small at the time, was saved by the loyalists
 dhire-dhire gorkhaon kaa prabhutv badhata gaya or inhonen lagbhag 12 varshon tak raaj kiya
 Their kingdom extended to Kangra, then the Gurkhas were driven out of Kangra by Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 or idhar sudarshan shah ne east india company kii madad se gorkhaon se apana rajya punah chin liya
 The East India Company then merged Kumaon, Dehradun and erstwhile Garhwal into the British Empire and gave West Garhwal King Sudarshan Shah what was then known as Tehri Riyasat
 raja sudarshan shah ne apni rajdhani tehri yaa tehari nagar ko banaaya, baad main unke uttaradhikari pratap shah, kirti shah or narendra shah ne is rajya kii rajdhani kramshah pratap nagar, kirti nagar or narendra nagar sthapit kii
 All three ruled from 1815 to 1949
 tab bharat chodo andolan ke dauraan yahan ke logon ne bhi bahut badhachadh kar bhaag liya
 After independence, the desire of the people to be free from the rule of kings began to grow
 maharaja ke liye bhi ab raaj karnaa kathin hone laga tha
 And then in the end, the 60th King Manvendra Shah agreed to unite with India
 is prakaar san 1949 main tehri rajya ko uttar pradesh main milakar isi naam kaa ek jila bana diya gaya
 Later on 24 February 1960, the Uttar Pradesh government separated one of its tehsils to form another district called Uttarkashi

 The original Star Trek was an American television series produced by Jean Roddenberry, which first aired in 1966 and ran for three seasons, following the interstellar adventures of Captain James T
 Kirk and the crew of the Federation Starship Enterprise
 These adventures continued into an animated television series and six feature films
 Four more television series were produced, based on the same universe, but following other characters: Star Trek: The Next Generation, scheduled for several decades after the original series, the crew of a new Starship Enterprise Following; Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager contemporaries of The Next Generation; And Star Trek: Enterprise founded in the early days of interstellar travel by humans
 Following the story of the crew of The Next Generation, frenchise main darjanon computer or video game, saikadon upanyaas, saath hi, las vegas main ek thimadhaarit aakarshan bhi shaamil hai
 Continuing with the original television series and with subsequent films and series, the franchise created a cult phenomenon and introduced many pop culture references

 The conflict and political dimensions of Star Trek sometimes serve as a metaphor for contemporary cultural realities: Star Trek: The Original Series addresses the issues of the 1960s, similar to how the later episodes of their respective decades Have reflected the issues

 In response to the popularity of Star Trek in the movie theater, the series returned to television in 1987 in the critically acclaimed series Star Trek: The Next Generation
 The show was unusual in the sense that it was broadcast on first run syndication rather than on the major networks
 Paramount and local stations shared advertising time

 Paramount responded to the fans' request by renewing the Enterprise in the same way as expressed for TOS for the fourth season, but shifted it to the "friday Night Death Slot"
 Enterprise's performance, like the original series, did not fare well in this time-slot
 UPN announced the cancellation of Enterprise at the end of the fourth season and its final episode aired on 13 May 2005
 Fans of fans, such as "save Enterprise", tried to save the series again and even announced a campaign to raise $ 30 million to privately finance the fifth season of Enterprise
 Although the effort made a lot of headlines, the fans' campaign failed to save the series
 Enterprise's cancellation ended eighteen years of production work on Star Trek programming on television

 Michael Stranszinski and Bryce Zebel also tried to revive the franchise with the crew of the original series, but Paramount ignored the offer, as they were "not even willing to talk about Star Trek"

 of the original series Several authors such as Fontana, David Gerrold and Paul Schneider wrote for the series
 While its animated format allowed producers to create attractive other-planet scenarios and creatures, the re-enacted visuals and the musical form's liberal form and animation flaws have tarnished the series' reputation

 Nevertheless, elements of the animated series were used by the authors in later live-action series and films

 In the 1990s, the sci-fi channel also began to rebrand TAS
 The entire TAS was also released in laserdisk format during the 1980s

 The show premiered on 28 September 1987 and ran for seven seasons, ending on 23 May 1994
 Unlike previous television productions, the program was grouped instead of airing on network television
 It garnered the highest ratings from any series of Star Trek and was the # 1 syndicated show during the final few years of its original airing, allowing it to serve as a platform for ideas in other series
 Many of the relationships and races introduced in TNG became the basis of episodes in Deep Space 9 and Voyager
 It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Dramatic Series during its final season

 Recurring plot elements include the rebellion of Björr's long and brutal Cardassian occupation, Cisco's spiritual role for the Björn as messengers of the prophets, and the war with the Dominion in later seasons
 Deep Space Nine differs from previous Trek series for its long serial storyline, conflicts within the crew, and religious themes, all elements that were praised by critics and audiences, but which were featured by Roddenberry in The Original Series and The Next Generation was declined

 The Central Armed Police Forces were known as paramilitary forces prior to March 2011, but to avoid confusion, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued five Central Armed Police Forces viz: one for CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF, SSB
 Adopted the same nomenclature
 rail parivahan kaa ek zariyaa he jisamen yatriyon or maal ko patariyon par chalane vaale vaahanon par ek sthaan se dusre sthaan le jaaya jaataa he
 Traditionally, there are wheels under railway vehicles that run balanced on two tracks made of steel, but in modern times arrangements such as a 'maglev' hanging above the track with a magnetic effect and a monorail running on a track Are also counted in the railway system
 rail kii patari par chalane vaale vaahan aksar ek lambi pankti main ek dusre se zanjiron se jude hue dabbe hote hai jinhen ek yaa ek se adhik koyale, deazal, bijli yaa anya urja se chalane vaala ingine khenchataa he
 The coaches and engines connected in this way are called 'trains' or 'trains'
 vaise to 'rail' shabd lagbhag sabhi bhashaaon main pravesh kar chukaa he phir bhi bahut si bhashaaon main iske liye sthaneey shabd gadhe gaye hai
 Note that these words are found in treasuries and government documents, but are often not in common use
 bahut si bhashaaon main rail ko 'lohe kaa maarg' yaa 'lohe ke maarg par chalane vaala vaahan' jaise vichaar lekar shabdon kaa avishkaar kiya gaya he
 for example: vikrut padaarth aise padaarth ko kehete hai jiskaa ghanatv itnaa zyaada ho ki uske daab kaa adhiktam bhaag pauli apvarjan niyam se utpann ho
 Normally atoms in any material are excited due to temperature and this stimulation causes them to have a thermal pressure
 iske atirikt parmaanuon ke nabhik ek duusare ke liye pratikarshan rakhte hai or is se bhi daab paidaa hota he
 a third pressure comes from the Pauli exclusion law which prohibits two fermions from being in the same quantum state
 is daab ko vikrut daab kehete hai
 Generally the distorted pressure is much less than the thermal pressure and nucleus repulsion pressure
 agar us padaarth ko is bhayankarta se dabaaya jaae ki uskaa vikrut daab badhkar baaqi daabon se adhik ho jaae to aise padaarth kii avasthaa ko bhi vikrut kaha jaataa he
 For example, this situation is observed in metallic hydrogen in which the nuclei of hydrogen are drawn closer to each other than the bore radius (the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom and the electron
 samaan avasar kii paribhaasha or arth par kaaphi matbhed he
 Broadly, it means a social environment in which individuals are not discriminated against on the basis of such things in the attainment of education, employment, health facilities etc
 which the person cannot even change by trying

 Suni Taraporewala is a screenwriter and photographer

 Biography: video compresssont kaa abhipraay digital video chhaviyon ko darshane vaale data kii maatra kam kiye jane se he or yah chhaviyon dwaara liye gaye sthaan kaa sankuchan tathaa samayik rup se gati ke pratikaran kaa sangyojan he
 Video compression is an example of the concept of source coding and information theory
 yah lekh video compresssont ke anuprayogon se sambandhit he: sankuchit video, video ko prasaarit karne main lagane vaali bandwyeth ko prabhavi dhang se kam kar saktaa he, chaahe vah dharti par hone vaale broadcast ke zariye ho, cabel tivi athwa upgrahiy tivi sevaaon se ho
 Most video compressions are lossy - based on the concept that most of the data available prior to contraction is not necessarily essential for reasonably good quality
 For example, DVD uses a video coding standard known as MPEG-2 and which can compress 2 hours of video data 15 to 30 times and still obtain the image quality that is followed by simple interpretation
 The base is considered to be of high quality
 video compresssont, discs sthaan, video gunvattta tathaa video se uchit samay ke bheetar compresssont hataane ke liye aavashyak hardware kii keemat ke bich kii kiya jane vaala ek prakaar kaa sauda he
 However, if the video is lossy over-compressed, visual specific symptoms may appear
 video sampeedan vishisht rup se agal-bagal ke pixlon ke vargakar samoohon par sanchalit hota he jinhen mecroblox kaha jaataa he
 These groups of pixels or blocks are compared to the next frame and only the pixels converted to these blocks are sent by the video compression codec
 agar video main gati na ho to yah bahut acchhee tarah se kaam karata he
 For example, a motionless frame of text can be repeated with very little data transferred
 tathaa adhik gati vaale video main, ek frem se agle frem main adhik pixel parivartit hote hai
 When more pixels are converted, the video compression scheme has to send a large amount of data to maintain a large number of variable pixels
 yadi video saamagree main koi visphot, hajaaron chidiyaaon kaa jhund athwa aisi hi koi anya chhavi, jisamen ucch-aavriti kaa byora aadi shaamil ho, to yaa to gunvattta kam ho jaaegi athwa gunvattta banaaye rakhane ke liye parivartansheel bitret ko badha dena hoga jisase is badi hui soochna kii aapurti kii ja sake or byore ke str ko banaaye rakhaa ja sake
 The programming provider controls the amount of compression applied to its video before it is sent to the distribution system
 dividi, blue-re discs or echdi dividi kii mastering prakriya ke dauraan unpar video compresssont kiya jaataa he, haalanki blue-re va echdi dividi main sthaan kaaphi adhik hone ke kaaran unpar kiye jane vaale sankuchan ko kam rakhaa jaataa he, iske vipareet stream video jaise internet tathaa cellphone par sankuchan kaaphi adhik hota he
 The quality of the video produced by the software that stores the video on the hard drive or optical disc is mostly low, although this is not the case in all cases
 nirmaan uparaant kaary ke liye ucch bitret vaale video codek, jinamein sankuchan kaa str bahut kam athwa nahin ke baraabar hota he, uplabdh hai, par unase praapt filon kaa aakaar bahut bada hota he atah unka prayog vitaran ke liye taiyaar video ke rup main nahin kiya jaataa he
 Once a video with a highly lossy compression is produced, in which the image quality is compromised, it is impossible to get the original quality video image from it
 video multah rangeen pixlon kii tri-aiami sarini he
 Two dimensions fulfill the spatial directions of movies, and the third dimension represents the time zone
 data frem un sabhi pixlon kaa samooh hota he jo samay kii ek ikai main prakshepit hote hai
 Basically, the frame is similar to a static image
 video data main sthanik or samayik atiriktata shaamil hoti he
 Thus, the difference between frames and the time difference between frames is registered in order to coding equality
 ek tathy yah he ki maanviya aankh rang main chote antaron ko nahin dekh paati, parantu chamak main antar ko dekh leti hai or isi kaa phayda uthaate hue sthanik ankoding kii jaati he, isamen milte-julate rangon ke kshetron ko "ausat kiya" jaataa he 
 jab fremon kii shrenee main badi sankhya main pixel samaan hi hote hai, tab sthanik compresssont main sirf parivartit pixlon kaa hi koden kiya jaataa he
 Some forms of data compression are harmless
 iskaa arth yah he ki jab data dicompress kiya jaataa he, tab parinaam tathaa mulprati ke bich prayek bit saamaan hota he
 Although lossless compression of video is possible, it is rarely used, as acceptable quality in lossy compression is achieved with far higher contraction ratios
 video ke sankuchan kii sabase shaktishaalee takneekon main se ek interfrem compresssont he
 Interframe compression uses one or more previous or next frames to compress the current frame while an intraframe compression only compresses the current frame, thus it is an effective image compression
 sabase adhik prachlit vidhi prayek frem ko video ke pichley frem se tulana kar sankuchit karne kii he
 If there are some areas in the frame where there is no change, then the compression system uses the same parts from the previous frame to the next bit-wise manner by giving a short instruction
 yadi frem ke hisse saadhaaran dhang se chal rahe hon, to compressure nirdesh dekar praturup ko sthanantaran, ghuma kar, halkaa athwa gaharaa karke - lambe nirdesh ke dwaara samyojit kar detaa he, haalanki yah phir bhi intrafrem se chota hi hota he
 Interframe compression works well for programs that are viewed only by the viewer, but if the video parts are to be edited, it causes compression problems
 chunki interfrem compresssont main ek frem se duusare main data kapi kiya jaataa he, isliye yadi mul frem kho jaye, usapar aadhaarit anya fremon ko thik tarah se nahin banaaya ja sakegaa
 kuch video praaroop, jaise ki divi intrafrem compresssont kaa prayog karte hue prayek frem ko swatantra rup se sankuchit karte hai
 Making 'cuts' in compressed video by intraframe is almost as easy as editing uncompressed video - for this, just by searching the start and end of each frame, the frames you want to keep will be copied bit-wise
 , And those not to be kept will be discarded
 Another difference between an intraframe and an interframe compression is that in the intraframe system, the data size of each frame is the same
 adhikansh interfrem pranaaliyon main kuch frem anya fremon se data copy nahin kar pate hai atah unhen apane nazadik ke anya fremon kii tulana main adhik data kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is possible to create a computer-based video editing tool that can detect the problem that other frames are not being edited when other frames require it
 Because of this, other new formats used for editing such as HDV have been created
 haalanki, saamaan gunvattta vaale intrafrem compress video ke sampadan kii tulana main is prakriya main kahin adhik computing shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Nowadays, almost all commonly used video compression procedures use discrete coordinate transforms to reduce spatial redundancy
 anya tareeke, jaise ki fractal compresssont, maiching parasyu tathaa discreet wevlett transform filhal shodh kaa vishay hai tathaa vyaavhaarik utpaadon main abhi shaamil nahin kiye gaye hai 
 fractal compresssont main logon kii ruchi kam hoti ja rahi he, aisa isliye he kyonki saidhantik vishleshan se aise tareekon main prabhaavaheenata kaa pataa chalaa he

 2009-10 sijan ke baad ISU congress ne barf nrity kii pratiyogitaaon kaa swaroop badalane or unhen or zyada jode or ekal skating jaisaa banane ke liye matdaan kiya
 Thus a new miniature dance was introduced at the beginning of the 2010–11 season
 pratispardhaa ke is khand main band kiye gayi anivaary nrity or mul nrity kii visheshtaon ko milaayaa gaya; prayek team nrity ke aadhe hisse tak anivaary nrityon main se ek apekshit namoonay ke mutabik pradarshit karti he or uske baad ISU dwaara nirdisht vishay yaa lay ke anusaar kuch aavashyak tatwon ke saath apni nrity rachana ke hisaab se pradarshan karti he
 Skaters are free to choose their own music, as long as the speeds are appropriate
 mukt nrity barf nrity pratiyogita kaa ek hissaa he
 It takes place as the third and final part of a competition commonly held after the compulsory dance and the original dance
 mukt nrity main timen apni lay, kaarykram ke vishay or isliye sangeet chunane ke liye swatantra hoti hai
 Creativity is also greatly encouraged
 1998 ke baad se nartakon ko kadamon ke kram, lift, nrity ke ghumaav or twijals kahe jane vaale kai tarah ke ghumaavon sahit roteshan sahit unke mukt nrity ke kuch tatwon ko shaamil karnaa hota he
 Senior level free dances are four minutes long and usually have several musical splits and movements that help diversify the routine
 isamen haath ko pakadaney or sthitiyaan anivaary or mul nrity shreniyon kii tulana main adhik khule or swatantra hote hai
 Teams often have to try to skate in difficult or unusual situations to gain difficulty points
 mukt nrity main mul nrity se adhik lift hote hai
 Ice dance lifts are different from couple skating, in which the person is forbidden to move their hands above their couple's head, but hand-holding allows for wide variations
 disha main jitna zyada badlaav, lacheelaapan or lift main parivartan hoga, ank paimaane kii samhita ke tahat jajon kii ore se team utane hi zyada ank hasil kar sakati he
 Too many detour jumps are not allowed
 "aadha" kud ko ab anumati mili he
 Both skaters must rotate around the same axis to create a rotation, in the same way that a couple produces rotation
 britain main barf nrity kii majboot parampara he
 Many compulsory dances, which are still contested today, were developed by many British dancers in the 1930s and were won by British couples in 12 of the first 16 world championships in ice dance
 jeni torvil or christopher dean kii british team ne 1984 main sarajevon main olympic swarna padak jitkar prasiddhi hasil kii or iske saath ravel bolero main naatakeey mukt sket kar prastuti ke liye sarvasammati se 6
0 ank arjeet kiye
 The British style of ice dance originally emphasized straight lift and knee bending and reaching the edges
 1960 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main, purvi europea scateron ne zyada khuli sthitiyon main nrity kii pravriti shuru kii, jisamen barf par zyada gati paidaa karnaa, sharir ke or adhik upree hisson kii bhagidaari or darshakon ke prati or adhik prakshepan sambhav hua
 In the 1970s, top Soviet dancers began to develop a more dramatic style of ice dance by incorporating elements based on themes such as ballet and often scripted programs
 nrity kii roosi style main vistaarit rekha or gati par zyada jor diya gaya, na ki kathin talbaddh footwork par
 kuch maamalon main sharir ke upree hisse kii vistrut nritykala kaa upyog skating takanic kii moulik kamiyon ko chhadam aavaran pradaan karne ke liye istemaal hota tha
 However, in the early 1990s, the performance routines of all the top dance parties were more theatrical than the ballroom style
 is dauraan international skating union ne pehle sangeet or nrity pakad par or zyada pabandi lagaakar barf nrity main zyada naatakeeyata ko niyantrit kar iske bollroom jadon kii ore lautne kaa prayaas shuru kiya
 Later, when it was complained that the ice dance had become quite boring, these restrictions were removed and replaced with requirements that dancers incorporate some specified technical elements into the original dance and free dance
 The effect of this is that less technique and dramatization are more emphasized on theatricality in decision making
 nartakon ke ek nishchit dhun ke saath sangeet par sket karne kii jarurat ab bhi barkaraar hone par bhi barf nrity vartmaan main figure skating ekmaatr vidha he jo pratiyogita kii main geet ke saath vaadya sangeet kii anumati detaa he

 International unit system is the modern form of metered system
 ise saamaanya rup main dashamalav evam das ke gunankon main banaaya gaya he
 It is the most used system in the world in the field of science and commerce
 puraani metric pranali main kai ikaayiyon ke samooh prayog kiye jate the
 SI was developed in 1960 from the old meter-kilogram-second system, rather than the centimeter-gram-second system, which had many difficulties
 SI pranali sthir nahin rahati, varan isamen nirantar vikaas hote rahete hai, parantu ikaiyaan anterrashtriya samjhauton ke dwaara hi banaai or badali jaati hai
 The system is almost universally applicable and most countries do not even understand the official definitions of other units
 parantu iske apwaad sanyukt rajya america or britain hai, jahaan abhi bhi gaiyr-si ikaayiyon unki puraani pranaliyaan lagu hai
 In India, this system came into force on 1 April 1957
 iske saath hi yahaan nayaa paisa bhi lagu hua, jo ki swayan dashamalav pranali par aadhaarit tha
 Many new naming units came into force in this system
 is pranali main saat mul ikaiyaan or anya kai vyutpann ikaiyaan hai
 Other units are also used with the SI system in some scientific and cultural fields
 SI upsargon ke madhyam se bahut choti or bahut badi matraaon ko vyakt karne main saralata hoti he
 The difference between the definition and implementation of an entity is important
 prayek SI mul ikai kii paribhaasha saavdhaanee purvak banaai gai he taaki vah apurv or adwitiya ho or saath saath ek thos saidhantik aadhaar prastut kare jis par aadhaarit sabase parishuddh or punarutpaadaneey maapan kiye ja saken
 The process of implementing a definition of a unit is one in which that definition, like that unit, establishes the value of its quantity and the uncertainty associated with it; Can be used
 kuch mahatvapurn ikaayiyon kii paribhaashaayen kaise karyanvit kii jaati hai, yah BIPM kii websit par diya gaya haiek SI vyutpann ikai adwitiya rup keval SI mul ikaayiyon ke rup main hi paribhaashit hoti he
 For example, the SI derivative unit of electrical resistance, ohms, is uniquely defined by this relation: ω = m2 kg s − 3 a − 2, which is the result of the definition of the amount of electrical resistance
 vaise koi bhi tarika, jo ki bhautikee ke siddhanton / niyamon se saamanjasy rakhata ho, vah kisi bhi SI ikaayiyon ke karyanvayan hetu prayog ho saktaa he
 The metric system was designed by a group of scientists
 inamen antoni loriat lavashie pramukh the, jinhen aadhunik rasayanashastra kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 To make this group a rational measurement system; Was unified and authorized by the French Emperor Louis XVI
 francisi kranti ke uparaant nai sarkaar dwaara yah pranali angeekrut kar lee gai thi
 a new decimal meter was also adopted by the National Conference on August 1, 1793, and defined a temporary length as well as other decimal units
 7 april, 1795 ko, gramme evam kilogramme ne puraani shabdaawalee "gravet" evam "grev" kaa sthaan liya
 On December 10, 1799, the metric system was permanently adopted in France
 aaj vishwa bhar main prayog ho rahi metric pranali ne kai badlaav dekhe hai
 It has also superseded many traditional systems
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke bahut baad tak kai bhinn maapan pranaliyaan vishwa bhar main prayukt ho raheen thim
 Many of these systems were different from the metric system, while others were based on either the Imperium system or the American system
 tab yah aavashyaktaa siddh hui ki in sab kaa metrikaran hona chaiye, jisase ek vishwavyaapee maapan pranali banaai ja sake
 Consequently, the ninth General Conference on Weights and Measures was held in 1948 in which the International Committee on Weights and Measures was directed to conduct an international study of the measurement requirements of scientific, technological and teaching committees
 is adhyayan ke parinaamon par aadhaarit, dasvin CGPM ne 1954 main yah nirnay kiya ki chah mul ikaayiyon se ek anterrashtriya pranali vyutapann kii jaae, jo ki yantric evam vidyutchumbakeey matraaon kii saath hi taapmaana evam drushti sambandhi vikiranon kaa maapan uplabdh kara paae
 The six original units approved were meters, kilograms, seconds, amperes, degrees, calvin and candela
 1960 main, 11wein CGPM ne is pranali kaa namakaran anterrashtriya ikai pranali yaa International System of Units, sankshep main SI jo multah bana he french se: Le Système international d'unités
 saatvin mul ikai, mol yaa the mole, ko 1971 main 14wein CGPM main joda gaya
 The International Standardization Organization or ISO standard ISO 31 contains recommendations by the International Electrotechnical Commission or IEC for use in electrical applications of the international unit system, of which their standard IEC 60027 is also noteworthy
 vah kaary abhi pragati par he jisase kii donon kaa ekikaran kar ek sanyukt maanak ISO / IEC 8 xxrep 4 0 bane, jise matraaon kii anterrashtriya pranali yaa International System of Quantities kaha jaae
 In the international unit system, there is a group of units, with the same group of prefixes
 SI ikaayiyon ko do upasamoohon main baanta ja saktaa he :- These units as well mul ikai ke gunak banane hetu, SI upsarg ko joda ja saktaa he
 All multiples are absolute numbers of ten
 udhaahrantah kilo-= sahasr yaa hajaar mili-= hajaarwaan bhaag yani ek meter main ek hajaar millimetre hote hai, saath hi ek hajaar meter se ek kilo meter banataa he
 Prefixes cannot be mixed
 ek kilogram kaa das lakhwan bhaag he milligram parantu use ek micro-kilogram nahin kahenge
 To establish a relationship between the units used in different systems, the unit is created from the tradition or basic definition of the unit
 ikaayiyon ke bich antaran hetu antaran karkon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are several versions of transfer factors, see for example Appendix B, NIST SP 811
 spacific gravity ko praayah SI ikaayiyon main, yaa pani ke sandarbh main darshit kiya jaataa he
 Because a cube whose size is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, its volume will be 1000 cm3, which is equal to 1 L; And when filled with water, its weight is 1 kg, hence the specific gravity of water is 1 g / cm3 and it will freeze at 0 ° C
 metric pranali ko arth evam dainik vaanijya saadhan ke rup main vishwavyaapee samarthan mila he
 The reason for this was also to a large extent that many countries did not have the ability to explain many principles in conservative systems
 saath hi kshetreey badlaavon kaa maanakeekaran kar ek vishwa vyapee pranali, jo sarv maanya ho, bani
 This also encouraged international trade
 vaigyanik drushtikon se dekhen, to isamen atyadhik badi or atisookshm ikaayiyon ko bhi dashamalav ke prayog se bataaya ja saktaa he
 Many units of daily and scientific experimentation are not derived from the seven basic units
 kai maamalon main yah badlaav BIPM

 Some examples include: european sangh ne ek nirdesh diya he jo gaiyr-si chinhit saamaan kii bikri ko 31 disambar 2009 ke baad se pratibandhit karata he
 This applies to all products, attached instructions and papers, packing and advertisements
 lekin 11 sitambar 2007 ko, EU ne ghoshit kiya he, ki britain ko is nirdesh se mukt karte hai or unka imparial pranali abhi bhi aniyat roopen maanya hoga, saath saath main metric pranali ke diya ho to

 According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 Historically, competitive devaluation has been done as rare countries generally prefer to retain their currency for a higher value
 Countries generally work for acceptable market forces, or have participated in, system-managed exchange rates
 An exception occurred when a currency war broke out in the 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations to make an effort to stimulate their economies
 Since it effectively pushes unemployment overseas, business partners quickly retaliate with their own devaluation
 The period has been considered to have been in an unfavorable situation for all concerned parties, as unexpected changes, lower overall international trade in exchange rates

 In the absence of intervention by the national government officials in the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate is determined in a country's currency, in general, the market is a point in time on the forces of supply and demand
 Government officials may intervene in the market from time to time to achieve specific policy objectives as to balance their trade or to give international trade in a competitive advantage to its exporters

 According to economist Richard N
 Cooper, writing in 1971, a major devaluation is one of the most "painful" government policies one can adopt - it can almost always be substituted for government for the outrage and call of cries

 The devaluation of wishing for a state, or at least the appreciation of its currency, should work within the constraints of the current international monetary system
 During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over the functions of their exchange rates through their central banks
 After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s, the market has grown significantly, with the effect in countries of an increasing number of exchange rates to establish the extent of market forces
 However, a state central bank can still interfere in a devaluation to the effect of markets - if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies compared to the reference error: the opening tag is bad or its name is bad
 So it will cause the value to fall for its currency - a practice common with the US managed an exchange rate regime

 Finally, a central bank can effect interest at its base rate by reducing a devaluation; Although this has sometimes been of limited effect, and since, at the end of World War II, most central banks have their own domestic economy according to their base rate needs

 Quantitative easing is the practice in which a central bank tries to reduce its domestic economy for the money supply by increasing a real or potential recession
 This can be done by operating the open market through domestic economy in money printing and injection

 a € 60bn per month quantitative easing program was launched in January 2015 by the European Central Bank
 While reducing the value of the euro was not part of the program's official objectives, there was considerable speculation that the new EQ represents an increased currency war, especially analysts working in FX markets
 David Wu, for example, one of the managing directors of Bank of America Merrill Lynch had said "a growing consensus" among market participants that the US are actually engaging in a stealthy currency war
 a Financial Times editorial, however, claimed that the rhetoric about the currency war was misguided once again

 Compared to the situation in the 1930s war with currency in 2010, ambrose-pritchard's Daily Telegraph suggested a new currency war could be beneficial for countries suffering from trade deficits, noting that the 1930s In it was, once surplus countries were severely affected that competitive devaluation began

 Ben Bernanke, president of the US Federal Reserve, has also attracted France and the US by referring to the inter-war period in competitive devaluation by referring to the flow of sterilized gold which helped them maintain large trade
 There is surplus, but whatever causes the deflationary pressure to contribute to its business partners, the Great Depression
 Bernanke stated for example that the 1930s implies that "search-export development cannot ultimately be successful, so the implication is that strategies for global growth and stability are not taken into account have taken
 " In February 2013, the financial times for Gavyn Davis emphasized that a significant difference between the 1930s and 21st century outbreaks was that some retaliations of the thirties were between countries, not devaluations, but increases There are import tariffs, which make for much more disruptive international trade

 In the 2007 book, Currency Wars by Chinese Economist Song Hongbing, the term is sometimes used in a somewhat contrary sense, to refer to an alleged practice where unscrupulous bankers lend to emerging market countries and then To think that it is against the desire to down in value to force America by trying against the currency of the emerging state

 Jim Rickards, 2011 book "the Next Global Crisis of the Currency War," argues that the result of the Fed's attempt to resort to economic growth could be disastrous for US national security
 Although the book of record is, to a large extent, concerned with currency war as competitive devaluation, it uses the definition of a broader term, classing policies that cause inflation as the currency war
 Such policies can be seen as symbolic warfare, against those who do not favor monetary assets, but as long as the effects of rising inflation on international trade are offset by a devaluation, Inflation policies tend to make a country's exports less competitive against foreign countries
 In his book review, Publishers Weekly said: " unka tark he ki ek vittiya hamale ke khilaaf america ko nasht kar saktaa he dollar main vishwaas he 
 In view of Rickards, the Fed believes in reducing policy easing by quantitative easing, may lead to chaos in global financial markets
 "kirkus Review said:" To see Rickards', the world is currently underway Through competitive devaluation on the basis of a third currency war
 The CWII took place in the 1960s and 70s and the gold standard of the dollar for Nixon's decision making in the finale
 The CWI followed i and World War i in 1923 against the German hyperinflation and the dollar devaluation of Roosevelt in gold in 1933
 Rickards demonstrates that competitive devaluations are a race to the bottom, and a war of sorts of such devices is

 He provides a view of how the continued depreciation and devaluation of the dollar is ultimately a lead to a collapse, which he claims will come about through a useless inflated means of mass abandonment

 siton kii sankhya Vote percentage prerani motor prayavarti dhara se chalane vaali motor he jiske roter kii koniya chaal stater vinding dwaara paidaa kiye gayi ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii koniya chaal se kam hoti he
 For this reason this motor is called asynchronous motor
 ise 'preran motor' is kaaran kaha jaataa he kyonki iske roter main preran ke dwaara dhara utpann hoti he kyonki roter tathaa ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii chaal alag-alag hoti he
 This motor is most commonly used due to which it is called the workhorse of industries
 isamen ghisne vaala koi avyav nahin he jisase yah bina marammat ke bahut dino tak chal saktaa he
 It is of many types- gharon main saamaanya kaaryon evam kam shakti ke liye prayukt adhikansh motaren ek-feji preran motor hi hotin hai inhen fractional horshpawar motor bhi kehete hai
 For example wings, motors for washing machines, etc
 prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi disht dhara motaron kii bhanti hi kshetrakundaliyaan tathaa armechar hote hai, parantu kuch vibhinn rup main
 They consist of two main parts: one is the stator, which remains fixed and the other rotor which rotates
 prayavarti dhara motaren bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai
 The most-common alternating current motor is the induction motor, which operates on the principle of induction
 preran motaron main stater kundalan trikla sambharan se sambhddha hota he, jiske kaaran ek ghurni chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 The conductors of the rotor can also be in the form of triangular coils, which are short-circuited by copper rings at both ends
 aisi rachana vastut:, gilahari ke pinjre kii bhanti hoti he
 Hence, such motors are commonly called 'squirrel Panzer Induction Motor', or 'panjar Motor' only
 ye motor banaavat main bahut sudrudh hote hai tathaa saath hi saath saral tathaa saste bhi hote hai
 Their efficiency is also higher than other motors of the same size
 atev in motaron kaa prayog praaia: saarvatrik he
 But the operation of these motors is, in a way, determined by the design of the rotor and cannot be changed as per the requirement
 inkaa aarambhik balaghurna bahut kam hota he, jise sudhaarney ke liye roter paripath main kuch pratirodh nivisht karnaa aavashyak hota he, parantu sthir praroop kii rachana ke kaaran aisa sambhav nahin ho paata
 Also, the resistance of the rotor drivers cannot be increased permanently, as the loss will increase more and the efficiency of the motor will decrease
 adhik aarambhik, balaghurna praapt karne ke liye dwipanjar motor prayukt kiye jate hai, jinamein ek ke sthaan par do panjar hote hai
 Depending on the type and position of the rotor grooves, some variation in operating characteristics can be achieved and they can be qualified for a variety of purposes
 kisi asi motor kii tulykaalik chaal n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} se aashay uske stater ke ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii chaal se he
 Its value can be derived from the following formula- jahaan f { \ displaystyle f} motor kii supplai kii aavriti tathaa p { \ displaystyle p} chumbakeey dhruvon kii sankhya he udhaaharan ke liye, 50 hertz kii supplai tathaa, 6 pole vaale teen-feji motor ke liye p { \ displaystyle p} = 6 tathaa n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} = 1,000 RPM Slip s { \ displaystyle s} is often defined as follows- jahaan n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} sincronas speed, n r { \ displaystyle n_{r}} roter kii chaal yadi roter sincronas chaal se gum rahi ho to slip kaa maan shunya hoga, yadi roter bilkul na chal rahi ho to slip kaa maan 1 hoga
 The value of the fault generated by the motor depends on the slip of its rotor
 jisko 'slip-tork vaishishty' kaha jaataa he
 It is clear that induction motors run at 'almost' constant speed
 bhaar ke saath unka chaal vicharan bahut kam hota he
 Therefore, loads that require steady movement are very useful there
 parantu jahaan vicharanshil chaal kii aavashyaktaa ho, vahaan panjar motor saamanyat: prayukt nahin kiye jate
 Their speed is slightly less than synchronous speed, which depends on the pole number and frequency
 at: chaal vicharan karne ke liye yaa to dhruv sankhya main parivartan karnaa aavashyak he, athwa aavriti kaa hi vicharan karnaa aavashyak he
 Frequency variance refers to arranging a separate supply whose frequency can be changed
 iske liye aajkal char aavriti drive aa rahe hai
 The pole number can be changed to a specific ratio by changing the connection of the coil, such as it is possible to convert a 4 polar motor to an 8 polar or 6 polar motor
 is prakaar in dhruv sankhyaon ke tatsambandhi veg bhi praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 The synchronous speed of 4 polar motor at 1,500 cyclic frequency is 1,500 RPM and that of 6 polar and 8 polar are 1,000 and 750 RPM respectively
 is tarah aisi motor kii dhruv sankhya main parivartan kar, inaki tatsambandhi chaal praapt kii ja sakati he
 But these can only happen in two or three sequences
 is vidhi se vistrut paraas main chaal vicharan praapt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Another method of gait variance in certain sequences is called "sopanipat control"
 yah vidhi belan milon main adhiktar prayukt kii jaati he
 Different types of machine tools also require variable speed, but in general, the variance is done by changing the gear order

 An autotransformer is a transformer with a structure that has only one winding
 ek hi vinding kaa kuch bhaag primary kaa kaam karata he or kuch bhaag dwitiyak vinding kaa kaam karata he
 Thus, this single winding has at least three electrical ends
 is tarah kaa transafarmar samaan kevie reating se saamaanya transafarmar kii apeksha aakaar or vajan main chota hota he
 But there is no isolation between primary and secondary, which is essentially necessary somewhere
 autotransformar main ek hi vinding hoti he jiske do siron ke alaava bich main bhi ek yaa adhik truminal hote hai
 The primary is placed between the two ends
 output voltage bich ke kisi terminal or ek antim sire ke bich liya jaataa he
 Each turn of the entire winding of this transformer has the same voltage, whether it is in the turn primary or in the secondary
 autotransformar main primary se kuch dhara sidhe lod ko chali jaati he

 They are also autotransformers but the output is not taken from a fixed point, but through a carbon brush sliding on the winding
