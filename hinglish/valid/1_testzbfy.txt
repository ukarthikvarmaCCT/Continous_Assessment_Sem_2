 In the internal economy system, this means that holding zero interest would mean zero return on government securities, or negative return on short-term maturity
 In the open economy, it gives rise to trade and devalues the currency without setting exports to the same level by setting higher prices for imports
 mudravaadi siddhant main, apsfiti kaa sambandh nirantar ghatate hue mudra veg athwa lenden kii sankhya se he

 Competition in the market often prompts those producers to reduce the arbitrary price of their goods by adding at least a fraction of their cost savings
 When this happens, consumers pay less for those goods and this results in deflation, as the ability to purchase is increased
 jab kisi kii mudra kii kray karne kii kshamta main vruddhi laabhprad lagati he, yah vastav main kathinaayee paidaa kar saktaa he jab kisi ke nival mulya kaa bada hissaa arthsulabh astiyo main jaise ki makaan, zamin tathaa duusare roopon main nijee sampattiyon main laga hota he
 It also increases the burden of debt because - after some significant period of deflation - when someone pays to service the debt, it represents a larger amount of purchasing and not when the loan first originated
 natijatan, apsfiti ko kisi rin byaaj dar kii chaaya ke pravardhan ke rup main bhi mana ja saktaa he
 If during the catastrophic recession of the United States, deflation averages at 10% per annum, debt at 0% also becomes unviable as it is required to be repaid annually at a higher cost value of 10%

 General methods of regulating the supply of money may be ineffective, even if the short-term interest rate is reduced to zero, the resultant "real" interest rate will remain high; Therefore, other tips for increasing the supply of money, such as purchase of assets or quantitative easing, have to be made effective
 sanyukt rajya america ke fedral rigerv ke vartmaan adhyaksh, ben barnanke ne, san 2002 main kaha, "mudra kaa paryaapt antah kshepan antat: hameshaa hi vipareet apsfiti utpann karegaa
" Proponents of cash money argue that deflation should have a welcome impact if there are no "hardwalls" in an economy, as a reduction in prices may shift the effort of the economy to other activity sectors
 Thus the total product of the economy may increase

 Since periods of deflation are supported by those who hold the currency for those who do not own the currency, it is often compared to periods of increasing populism, as the United States populists by the end of the 19th century had scarce currency

 In a debt-dependent modern economy, deflationary highs can arise by initiating higher interest rates, which may cause asset bubbles to break quickly or a controlled economy to crumble at a higher level of production than what it could actually support

 To reduce or prevent deflationary high velocity, banks often stop repayment of unprocessed loans
 This is often a way of bridging the gap because they must then curb lending, as they do not have the money to lend, which further reduces demand, and so on

 a lost inferior planet is an inferior planet seen by astronomers but for such a short time that its orbit has disappeared and gone to some unknown location before it is known properly
 aise khoye hin grah kabhi-kabhi baad main phir mil jate hai lekin kabhi-kabhi dashakon tak phir nahin mil pate
 Often the orbits of inferior planets are clumsy compared to larger planets, which makes them more likely to disappear
 kuch vaigyanikon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki lagbhag aadhe gyaat hin grah khoye jate hai
 According to some, it is estimated that more than one and a half million inferior planets are lost at this time

 a genetic algorithm is a search technique that is used to obtain precise or approximate solutions to optimization and search problems
 yah elgoridm, anekon vikasaatmak kalanvidhiyon main se ek he
 Developmental algorithms are based on following techniques of evolution and related concepts
 anuvanshik elgorithm kaa kriyanvayan ek computer simulation main kiya jaataa he, jisamen ek samasya ke anukulan ke liye ummidavaar ke samaadhaan kehalaata he) ke saar pratinidhitiv yaa gunasutra kehalaata he) kii ek aabaadi behatar hal viksit karti he
 Traditionally, solutions are expressed in binary as a series of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible
 vikaas aamtaur par yadrichhik rup se utpann hue vyaktiyon se shuru hota he or pidhiyon main hota he
 In each generation, the fitness of each individual is evaluated, stochastically multiple individuals are selected from the current population and modified to create a new population
 iske baad elgorithm kii agle charan main nayi aabaadi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In general, the algorithm finishes when either the maximum number of generations has been generated or a satisfactory fitness level has been attained for the population
 yadi elgorithm kii samaapti pidhiyon kii adhiktam sankhya ke kaaran hui he, to ek santoshjanak samaadhaan praapt ho saktaa he yaa nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 Genetic algorithms have applications in bioinformatics, phylogenetics, computational science, engineering, economics, chemistry, manufacturing, mathematics, physics and other fields
 ek praroopik anuvanshik elgorithm ke liye aavashyak he: a standard representation of the solution is an array of bits
 anya prakaar or saranchanaaon ke ere ko aavashyak rup se saamaan tareeke se prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 The key feature that facilitates these genetic representations is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size, which makes the simple crossover procedure easier
 char lambaai pratinidhitiv kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he, lekin is maamle main krosover kriyanvayan adhik jatil ho jaataa he
 Tree-type representations appear in genetic programming and graphs derived from representations appear in evolutionary programming
 fitness function ko anuvanshik pratinidhitiv par paribhaashit kiya jaataa he or yah pratinidhitiv ke samaadhaan kii gunvattta kaa maapan karata he
 The fitness function always depends on the problem
 udhaaharan ke liye, nepsek samasya main koi vyakti object ke kul maan ko adhiktam karnaa chahta he jise kisi nishchit kshamta ke nepsek main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The expression of a solution can be an array of bits, where each bit expresses a different object and the value of the bit expresses whether the object is in a knapsack
 aisi prayek abhivyakti maanya nahin hoti he, kyonki object kaa aakaar nepsek kii kshamta se adhik ho ekta he
 The fitness of the solution is equal to the sum of the values of all objects in the knapsack if the expression is valid or 0 otherwise
 kuch samasyaon main, fitness ke vyanjak ko paribhaashit karnaa yaa to mushkil hota he yaa phir asambhav hota he; in maamalon main, interective anuvanshik elgorithm kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Once we define the genetic expression and fitness function, GA proceeds to initialize the population of the solution, then improve it through mutation, crossover, reversal, and selection operators
 prarambh main ek praarambhik aabaadi ke nirmaan ke liye kai vyaktigat samaadhaan yadrichhik rup se utpann kiye jate hai
 The size of the population depends on the nature of the problem, but typically consists of several hundreds of thousands of possible solutions
 paramparaagat rup se, jansankhya yadrichhik rup se utpann hoti he or sambhav samaadhaanon kii puri range ko cover karti he 
 kabhi kabhi, samaadhaan un kshetron main "shuru kiye" ja sakate hai jahaan anukultam samaadhaan milane kii sambhaavna hoti he
 During each next generation, a proportion of the existing population is selected for breeding a new generation
 ek fitness aadhaarit prakriya ke madhyam se vyaktigat samaadhaanon kaa chayan kiya jaataa he, jahaan praroopik rup se adhik feet samaadhaan ke chune jane kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 Specific selection methods determine the fitness of each solution and prioritize the choice of the best solution
 anya vidhiyaan aabaadi ke keval ek yadrichhik namoonay ko nirdhaarit karti hai, kyonki is prakriya main bahut adhik samay lag saktaa he
 Most functions are stochastic and are designed such that a small proportion of low fit solutions are selected
 This helps to widen the population diversity, preventing premature convergence on bad solutions
 lokapriy or acchhee prakaar se chayan kii gayi vidhiyon main shaamil hai rolet wheel chayan or toornament chayan
 The next step is to generate a second-generation population of the solution selected through the genetic operator: also called crossover) and / or mutation
 utpann kiye jane vaale prayek nae samaadhaan ke liye, "janak" samaadhaan ke ek yugma kaa chayan kiya jaataa he, taaki pehle chayan kiye gaye pool se prajnan kiya ja sake
 kros over or utparivartan kii uparokt vidhi kaa prayog karte hue, ek "baccha yaa santan" samaadhaan ke utpaadan ke dwaara, ek nayaa samaadhaan nirmit kiya jaataa he, jo praroopik rup se iske "janak" ke kai lakshanik gun rakhata he
 a new parent is selected for each child and the process continues until a new population of appropriately sized solutions is generated
 haalanki prajnan kii vidhiyaan jo do janakon kii upyog par aadhaarit hai, ve "jaev vigyaan se adhik prerit" hai, haal hi main kiye gaye anusandhan suzav dete hai ki do se adhik "janakon" kaa upyog karnaa ek acchhee gunvattta ke gunasutra ke prajnan ke liye behatar he
 These processes eventually result in a next-generation population of chromosomes that is distinct from the initial generation
 aamtaur par aabaadi ke liye is prakriya ke dwaara ausatan fitness main vruddhi hogi, chunki pehali peedhee se keval sarvottam jeevon ko prajnan ke liye chunaa jaataa he, saath hi kam feet samaadhaan ke ek chote anupaat ko liya jaataa he, iske liye kaaran upar bataaye gaye hai
 This process of generations is repeated until a termination condition is reached
 samaapti ke liye saamaanya sharten hai: There are several general observations about the generation of solutions through genetic algorithms: jatil ucch aiami, bahulmod kii samasyaon hetu anukool hal kii khoj ke liye aksar bahut mahange fitness function moolyankan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In real-world problems such as structural optimization problems, a single function evaluation may require several hours to several days of full simulation
 praroopik anukulan paddati is prakaar kii samasya se nipat nahin sakati he
 In this case, it may be necessary to skip an accurate evaluation and use an approximation fitness that is computationally effective
 aisa prathit hota he sannikat namoonon kaa sammishran ek aisa sabase vaayadapurna drushtikon ho saktaa he jo jatil vaastavik jivan kii samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye jaan boojh kar EA kaa prayog karata he
 This means that it does not know how to sacrifice short-term fitness to achieve long-term fitness
 The probability of this event depends on the size of the fitness landscape: specific problems provide an easy climb to a global compatibility, others make it easier for the function to discover local compatibility
 is samasya ko bhinn fitness function ke upyog se, utparivartan kii dar ke badhane se, yaa un chaynaatmak takneekon ke upyog se kam kiya ja saktaa he, jo samaadhaanon kii vividh aabaadi ko banaaye rakhti hai, haalanki no free lunch prameya siddh karti he ki is samasya kaa koi saamaanya samaadhaan nahin he
 a common technique to maintain diversity is to impose a "bottom penalty", in which, a sufficient degree of) extra penalty is incurred in a group of individuals, which will reduce the expression of that group in subsequent generations, thereby increasing the population Other people can be retained
 This wager, however, may not be effective depending on the scenario of the problem
 anuvanshik elgoritham main vividhta mahatvapurn he kyonki ek samajini aabaadi kaa crosing over nae samaadhaan nahin detaa he
 In development strategies and development programming, diversity is not necessary due to over-reliance on mutation
 is ke liye ek upaay ke rup main kai vidhiyon ke prastaav die gaye hai, jaise kisi tarah se anuvanshik vividhta ko badhaakar or jaldi abhisaran ko roak kar, yaa to utparivartan kii sambhaavna ko badhaa kar jab vilyan kii gunvattta gir jaati he,, yaa kabhi kabhi jin pool main puri tarah se nae, yadrichhik rup utpann tatwon ke dwaara 
phir se vikaas kii ranneetiyon or vikaas kii programing ko ek tathakthith "coma ranneeti " ke saath kriyanvit kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen janakon ko sambhaal kar nahin rakhaa jaataa he or nae janakon kaa chunaav keval santati se hi kiya jaataa he
 It can be more effective on dynamic problems
 in maamalon main, ek yadrichhik search ek samaadhaan ko utani hi jaldi khoj sakati he jitani ki ek GA
 haalanki, yadi sthiti aisi he ki safalataa / asafalataa ke pareekshan ko alag alag parinaam dete hue doharaaya jaataa he, to safalataa or asafalataa kaa anupaat ek upyukt fitness kaa maap uplabdh karaata he
