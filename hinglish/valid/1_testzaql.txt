 Lions died in northern Eurasia and the Americas during the last ice age about 10,000 years ago; This may be secondary to the deletion of Pleistocene megaphona
 paramparaagat rup se, haal hi main singh kii baarah up prajatiyon ko pahachaanaa gaya he, jisamen se sabase bada he barbari singh
 The main differences distinguishing these subspecies are position, mane appearance, size, and distribution
 kyonki ye lakshan bahut naganya hai or ucch vyaktigat vibhedan ko darshaate hai, inamen se adhikansh rup vivadaspad hai or sambhavatya amaanya hai; iske atirikt, ve aksar agyaat utpatti kii chideaghar saamagree par nirbhar karte hai jo "mukhya lekin asaamaanya" aakaariki lakshanon se yukt hote hai
 Today only eight subspecies are commonly accepted, but one of these is very close to the lions
 vartmaan main aath haal hi kii up prajatiyon ko pahachaanaa jaataa he: Many additional subspecies of lion were found in prehistoric times
 singhon ko baagh ke saath prajnan ke liye janaa jaataa he jisase sankar kaa nirmaan hota he jo liger yaa tigon kehalaate hai
 They have also made leopon by breeding with leopards, and jegallions by breeding with jaguars
 maroji ek spoted singh yaa ek prakritik leopon he, jabaki congolij spoted singh ek jatil singh-jaguaar-tendue kaa sankar he jo lijagulep kehalaata he
 Such hybrids were commonly bred in zoos at some point, but now this process has been discouraged due to the emphasis on conservation of species and subspecies
 china main abhi bhi chidyagharon or nijee pashu pakshi sangrah main sankar prajnan karwaae jate hai
 Liger is a hybrid between a male lion and a female tiger, because a growth inhibitor gene is absent from a female tiger, a growth inducing gene is transferred by a male lion, the resulting liger more than any parent
 Live long

 Males have a 50 percent chance of having a mane, but if they develop one, their mane will be modest: about 50 percent of a pure lion's mane
 Ligers are typically 3

 Singh is the longest of all felines and also the second heaviest feline after tiger

 The lion's skull resembles that of the tiger, although the frontal area is generally more suppressed and flattened and the posterior orbital area is slightly smaller
 The lion's skull has larger nasal holes than the tiger
 haalanki, donon prajatiyon main khopadi kii bhinnata ke kaaran aam taur par keval nichle jabade kii saranchana ko prajati ke ek bharosemand sanketak ke rup main kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 The colors of lions also vary greatly, ranging from buff to yellow, red, or dark brown
 nichle bhaag aam taur par halke rang ke hote hai or poonch kaa guchha kaala hota he
 Lion cubs are born with brown spots on their body, a symptom similar to leopard
 haalanki jaise jaise singh vyask hone lagata he, ye dhabbe fike padate jate hai, fike pad gaye dhabbon ko vishesh rup se maadaa main, baad main bhi nichle bhaagon or taangon par dekha ja saktaa he
 The lion is the only member of the cat family that exhibits obvious sexual dimorphism — that is, males and females appear to be differentiated
 udhaaharan ke liye, sinhani, jo shikari kii bhoomika nibhaati he, main nar kii tarah mote bojhil ayaal kaa abhaav hota he
 For example, the lioness, the hunter, lacks a thick cumbersome mane like a male
 yah lakshan shikaar kaa peechha karte samay nar kii apane aap ko chupaane kii kshamta main avrodh banataa he or daudte samay bahut garmi utpann karata he
 The color of the male's mane varies from Kesari to Black, usually this color becomes darker as he grows older
 vyask singh ke sharir kaa bhaar aam taur par nar ke liye 150-250 kilogram or maadaa ke liye 120-182 kilogram hota he
 According to the Novell and Jackson report, the male weighs 181 kg and the female weighs 126 kg; a male weighing 272 kg was found near Mount Kenya
 Lions vary greatly in size, this variation depends on their environment and area, as a result there is also a great variation in the weight recorded
 udhaaharan ke liye, saamaanya rup se dakshini africa ke singh kaa bhaar purvi africa ke singh kii tulana main lagbhag 5 pratishat adhik paaya gaya he
 Head and body lengths are 170–250 cm in males and 140–175 cm in females; Shoulder height is approximately 123 cm in males
 And 107 cm in female
 it occurs
 poonch kii lambaai nar main 90-105 semi or maadaa main 70-100 semi hoti he
 The longest known lion was a male with a black mane shot in October 1973 near Maksu in southern Angola; The heaviest known lion was a male-eater killed in 1936 just outside Hectorsprayut in eastern Transvaal in southern Africa, weighing 313 kg

 The most distinguishing feature that is found in both males and females is that both have a tail ending in a tuft of hair, this bunch has a rigid "spine" or "spur" that is about 5 millimeters long
 , Which is formed from the last part of the tail bone that fused with each other
 singh ek maatr felid he jisamen ek guchchhedaar poonch pai jaati he-is spine or guchchhe kaa kaary agyaat hai
 Absent at birth, this bunch develops at around 51⁄2 months of age and is easily identifiable at 7 months of age
 ek vayask nar singh kii ayaal, billiyon ke bich adwitiya he, yah is prajati kaa sabase vishisht vibhedi lakshan he
 It makes the lion look big, gives a great look; It helps lions during combat with the main competitor of other lions and species, the spotted hyena of Africa, related to the presence, absence, color and size of mane, genetic structure, sexual maturity, climate, and the formation of testosterone
 ; According to Thumb Rule, the deeper and thicker the mane, the healthier the lion is
 sinhani apane langik saathi ke chayan ke dauraan us nar ko praathamikta detii he jisaki ayaal adhik ghani or gahari hoti he
 Research in Tanzania also suggests that mane-length in male-male relationships gives signals of success in fighting

 In a group consisting of two or three males, there is a possibility that the female wants to actively engage with a male whose mane is more dense
 vaigyanikon ne ek baar kaha ki kuch up prajatiyon kii vishisht sthiti ko aakaariki ke dwaara samajha ja saktaa he, jisamen ayaal kaa aakaar shaamil he
 The morphology is used to identify subspecies such as Barbary lion and Cape lion
 However research suggests that environmental factors such as ambient temperature affect the size and color of the mane
 europea or uttari america ke chidiagharon main thande parivesh taapmaana ke kaaran adhik ghani ayaal dekhi jaati he
 Thus the mane is not appropriately identified as a subspecies
 haalanki asian up prajati ke nar, ausat africa singh kii tulana main virali ayaal ke dwara parilakshith hote hai ayaal rahit nar singh kenya main senegal or saavo purv rashtriya park main paae gaye hai or timbavathi kaa mul safed nar singh bhi ayaal rahit tha
 The mane of castrated lions is minimal
 kabhi kabhi antar prajnit singh kii aabaadi main ek ayaal kii anupasthiti pai jaati he; yah antarprajnan bhi janan kii kshamta main kami kaa kaaran banataa he
 Many lions have a ruff that may be evident in special situations
 kabhi kabhi ise murtiyon, chitron, vishesh rup se pracheen kalakaari main ingit kiya jaataa he or ise galati se ek nar kaa ayaal samajha jaataa he
 It differs from a mane, although it is found below the ear at the jaw line, its hair is short and not quickly noticed, while a mane extends over the male's ears
 , Often covering their outer line completely
 vilupt europea gupha singh kii gupha chitrakaari jaanwaron ko ayaal ke bina darshaati he, yaa keval ayaal kaa ek sanket hi detii he, isse yah pataa chalata he ki ve kam yaa adhik ayaal rahit hi the; haalanki, ek samooh ke liye shikaar karti hui maadaaen chitron kaa mukhya vishay rahi hai-chunki unhen shikaar se sambandhit samooh main darshaya gaya he-isliye ye chitra is baat kaa faisla karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hai ki nar ayaal se yukt the
 Pictures show that extinct species used the same social organization and hunting strategies as contemporary lions
 safed singh ek vishisht up prajati nahin he, lekin ek anuvanshik sthiti, leukism kaa vishisht rup he, jo rang main peelepan kaa kaaran hoti he jisase safed baagh jaisaa rang praapt hota he; yah sthiti milanikaran ke samaan he, jo kaale panthrs kaa kaaran he
 They are not albinos, have normal staining in their eyes and skin, white transvaal lions occasionally appear in the cruiser national park and nearby Timbavati private game reserve in eastern southern Africa, but are usually kept in captivity, Breeders select them by thinking
 unke sharir par ek asaamaanya kriim rang kaa aavaran ek aprabhavi jin ke kaaran hota he
 Allegedly, they were bred in camps in southern Africa to be used to kill trophies during cand hunting
 The existence of the white lion was confirmed only in the late twentieth century
 For hundreds of years ago, the white lion was considered only a part of fictional stories in Southern Africa, it was believed that the white skin of the animal represented goodness among all creatures
 citing ko sabase pehle 1900 ke prarambh main report kiya gaya or yah lagbhag 50 saal tak aniyamit rup se jari rahi, jab 1975 main safed singh shaavak ke vyarth padaarthon ko timbavathi game rigerv main paaya gaya
 The lions spend most of their time resting and being inactive for about 20 hours a day, although lions can be active at any time, usually their activity intensifies after dawn when they gather, Groups form and bowel movements
 achaanak aantrayik gatividhiyaan raat ke dauraan subah tak hoti hai jab aksar shikaar kiya jaataa he
 On an average, they spend two hours a day walking and 50 minutes eating
 singh shikari mansabhakshi hai jo do prakaar ke saamaajik sanghathan ko abhivyakt karte hai
 There are some residents who live in a group called pride
 is pride main saamanyatya lagbhag paanch yaa chah sambandhit maadaaen, donon lingon ke unke shaavak or ek yaa do nar hote hai jo ek vyask maadaa ke saath sambandh banaata he 
 ek pride se sambandhit naron kaa sahamilan aam taur par do tak hota he, lekin bad kar chaar tak bhi pahunch saktaa he or samay ke saath phir se kam bhi ho saktaa he
 Male cubs leave their mother's pride when they are mature
 duusare sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar ko khanaabadosh kaha jaataa he, jo vyapak rup se ek range main faile hote hai or aniyamit rup se ghoomte hai, ye akele yaa jodon main rah sakate hai, sambandhi naron ke jode adhik dekhe jate hai jo apane apane mul pride se alag ho gaye hote hai
 Note that a lion can change its lifestyle; Can become nomadic residents and vice versa
 nar ko is jivan style se hokar guzarana hi padataa he or kuch kabhi bhi kisi pride main shaamil nahin ho pate
 ek maadaa yadi khanaabadosh ban jaati he to uske liye kisi nae pride main shaamil hona adhik mushkil hota he, kyonki ek pride main maadaaen sambandhi hoti hai or ve kisi asambandhi maadaa ke dwaara unke samooh main shaamil hone ke adhikansh prayaason ko asweekrut kar detii hai
 The area enclosed by a pride is called a pride zone, while a nomadic area is called a range
 ek pride se sambandhit nar, apane kshetra main gasht lagate hue, seemaant sthanon main rahanaa pasand karte hai
 Why socialism among the lionesses — the most obvious of any cat race — developed is a matter of controversy
 shikaar main safalataa ke badhane kaa ek spasht kaaran dikhaai detaa he, lekin yah jaanch par adhik nishchit nahin he: ek saath mil kar shikaar karne se prakriya main safalataa milti he, lekin saath hi yah bhi nishchit he ki shikaar nahin karne vaale sadsy prati sadsy calories antargrahan kii maatra ko kam kar dete hai, haalanki kuch shavakon ko uthaa kar bhoomika nibhaate hai, jo is vistaarit samay avadhi ke liye akele chode ja sakate hai
 Pride members regularly play an equal role in hunting
 shikari kaa swasthya pride ke astitv ko banaaye rakhane ke liye praathmik aavashyaktaa he or ve sait par le jane ke baad sabase pehle iskaa upbhog karte hai
 Other benefits include possible family selection, protection of the younger, maintenance of the area, and personal protection against injury and hunger
 sinhani apane pride ke liye adhikansh shikaar karti he, kyonki yah nar kii tulana main adhik choti, furtili or chust hoti he, isamen baari or vishisht ayaal bhi nahin hoti jo thakaan ke dauraan ati ushmit kar de
 apane shikaar kaa peechha karne or use safaltaapurvak khinch laane ke liye ve samooh main sahyog ke saath kaary karte hai
 However, if the prey is nearby, once the lioness succeeds and eats, the male tends to dominate the dead
 ve sinhani ke bajaay shavakon ke saath bhojan ko adhik baantate hai, lekin kabhi kabhi hi apane dwaara maare gaye bhojan ko baantate hai
 Small prey is eaten at the place of prey, hunters share it among themselves; When the prey is large, it is often dragged into the pride area
 bade shikaar ko adhik baanta jaataa he, haalanki pride ke sadsy aksar zyada se zyada bhojan kaa upbhog karne ke liye ek duusare ke prati ugr vyavhaar karte hai
 But males and females protect their pride against intruders
 kuch sadsy nirantar ghuspaithiyon ke khilaaf suraksha karte hai, jabaki anya peeche ho jate hai
 Lions have a special role in Pride
 peeche hat jane vaale sadsy samooh ke liye anya moolyawaan sevaayen pradaan kar sakate hai
 An alternative hypothesis that being a leader is associated with an award, this leader protects from intruders and the lioness's position in the pride is reflected in these responses
 nar yaa pride se sambandhit nar bahari naron se apane pride ke saath sambandh kii raksha karte hai, yahaan bahari nar ve nar hai jo pride ke saath sambandh banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Females form a permanent social unit in a pride and do not tolerate external females; Membership changes only at birth or at the death of a lioness, although some females leave the pride and become nomadic
 duusari or upvyask nar ko 2-3 varsh kii aayu main paripakvata tak pahunchne par pride ko chhodana padataa he
 Lions are powerful animals that usually hunt in a coordinated group and attack their selected prey
 haalanki ye vishesh rup se apni sahanshakti ke liye nahin jane jate hai- udhaaharan ke liye, ek sinhani kaa hryday uske sharir ke bhaar kaa keval 0
57 pratishat banaata he, jabaki ek hyena kaa hryday iske sharir ke bhaar ke 1 pratishat ke kareeb hota he
 Thus, although lionesses can reach speeds of 60 km / h, they can only do this for short periods, so they must be very close to the prey before launching an attack
 These take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; Most hunting is done at night or in a covered form
 jab ve shikaar se 30 meter yaa usase kam kii duuri par pahunch jate hai
 Then they shout at him
 aamtaur par, kai sinhaniyaan ek saath kaam karti hai or vibhinn binduon se jhund ko gher leti hai
 Once they reach a herd, they usually target the nearest prey
 hamalaa bahut chota or shaktishaalee hota he; ve bahut tej chalaang ke saath jaldi se shikaar ko pakadaney kaa prayaas karte hai
 The victim is usually strangled to death, which may be the cause of cerebral ischemia or asphyxia
 The prey can also be killed by the lion closing its mouth and NASA holes through its claws
 Smaller prey, though, only the lion could be killed by a swipe
 shikaar mukhya rup se bade standhari hote hai, jisamen junglee bist, impala, zebra, bhens or africa main varthog or nil gaay, junglee bor or bharat main kai hiran kii prajatiyon ko praathamikta di jaati he
 Many other species are hunted based on availability
 isamen mukhya rup se 50 se 300 kilogram bhaar ke anagulats shaamil hote hai jaise kudu, haaratabist, jemsbok or alend
 kabhi kabhi, ve apekshaakrit choti prajatiyon jaise thomson kaa gajela or springcoke kaa shikaar karte hai
 Lions living on the banks of the Namib hunt large-scale seal fishes
 samooh main shikaar karte hue singh adhikansh jaanwaron ko ghaseetne main sakasham hote hai, yahaan tak ki swasth vyask ko bhi, lekin unki range ke adhikansh bhaagon main ve bahut bade shikaar, jaise purnataya viksit nar jiraph par kabhi kabhi hi hamalaa karte hai
 Because they are prone to injury
 vibhinn adhyayanon ke dwaara ekatrit vistrut aankade bataate hai ki singh saamanyatya 190-550 kilogram range ke stanadhariyon ko shikaar banaate hai
 Wild Beast comes first in the most preferred hunting category, followed by Zebra
 Most adult hippopotamus, rhinoceroses, elephants and small gazelle, impala and other agile antilope are not commonly included
 haalanki jiraph or bhens ko aksar vishesh kshetron main le jaaya jaataa he
 For example, in Cruiser National Park, giraffes are hunted regularly
 or manyaar pack main, kep bhaisen singh ke bhojan kaa 62% bhaag banaati hai, kyonki bhaison kaa sankhya ghanatv ucch hota he
 Occasionally Hippopotamus is also hunted, but adult rhinoceroses are generally avoided
 haalanki 190 kilogram se chote varthog uplabdhta ke aadhaar par hi shikaar banaaye jate hai
 In some areas, they become specialized for hunting a typical prey species; This case can be seen on the Savuti river, where they hunt elephants
 kshetra ke park gidon ne report di ki bahut bhukhe singh hathi ke bachche ko ghaseet kar le gaye, iske baad kishor hathi ko or kabhi kabhi raat ke dauraan purna viksit vyask hathi ko bhi shikaar banaaya gaya kyonki unki drushti kamjor hoti he
 Lions also attack domestic animals; Cattle are a major part of their diet in India
 ve anya shikariyon ko bhi maarane main bhi sakasham hai, jaise tendua, chita, hyena or junglee kute, yadhyapi pratispardhiyon kii htya ke baad ve unhen kabhi kabhi hi khatm kar daalate hai
 They can also obtain food from animals that have been killed by nature or killed by some other predator, and keep an eye on the vultures constantly moving around, aware that they are killed or Indicates an animal in distress
 ek singh ek baar main 30 kilogram kha saktaa he
 If it is unable to eat the entire dead prey together then it rests for a few hours before consuming more
 ek garm din main, ek pride ek yaa do nar sadasyon ko raksha ke liye chhodkar chaaya main chalaa jaataa he
 An adult lioness requires an average of 5 kg of meat per day and a male 7 kg of meat
 kyonki sinhaniyaan khuli jagah par shikaar karti hai jahaan ve aasaani se apane shikaar ke dwaara dekhi ja sakati hai, sahyog se kiya gaya shikaar ek safalataa kii sambhaavna ko badhata he; yah vishesh rup se badi prajatiyon ke liye sach he
 Working together can protect their prey from other predators such as hyenas, which can also be attracted by vultures in open savannah areas from several kilometers away
 adhikansh shikaar sinhaniyaan hi karti hai; pride se jude nar aam taur par shikaar main bhaag nahin lete hai, keval bade shikaar jaise jiraph or bhais ke shikaar main ve bhaag le sakate hai
 In typical hunting, every lioness has a special position in the group, either catching and then attacking the prey with wings, or moving a short distance to the center of a group and catching prey flying from other lions
 Chhote Singh shows stalking behavior till the age of three months, although he does not participate in hunting until he is 1 year old
 By about two years of age they begin to hunt effectively
 adhikansh sinhaniyaan chaar saal kii umr main prajnan karti hai, singh varsh ke kisi vishesh samay par sambhog nahin karte hai or maadaaen bahundak hoti hai
 Like other cats, male lions have thorns on their penis that are bent backwards
 shishn se waapas baahar aate samay ye kaante maadaa kii yoni kii deevaaron ko ragadate hai, jiske kaaran andotsargan hota he
 a lioness can mate with more than one lion when it is hot; During an intercourse cycle, which lasts for several days, the couple can form a relationship twenty to forty times per day and can even skip food and singles breed very well in captivity
 ausat garbhaavadhi 110 dinon ke aasapaas he, maadaa ek ekant gupha main ek se chaar shavakon ke samooh ko janm detii he, saamanyatya shesh pride se dur jaakar bacchon ko janm detii he
 As long as the cubs are helpless, she herself becomes a victim and remains close to the place where the cubs are kept
 shaavak khud netraheen paidaa hote hai -unki ankhen janm ke lagbhag ek saptaah tak khulti nahin hai, unka vajan janm ke samay 1
2-2
1 kilogram hota he, ve lagbhag asahaay hote hai, janm ke ek do din ke baad rengne lagate hai or lagbhag teen saptaah ke baad chalanaa shuru karte hai sinhani ek maah main kai baar apane shavakon ko gardan se pakad kar ek ek karke nae den main le jaati he, aisa ek hi sthaan par bane rahane se bachane ke liye kiya jaataa he taaki shikari unke shavakon ko nuksaan na pahunchaae
 aam taur par maa apane aap ko ekikrut nahin karti he or uske shaavak chah se aath saptaah kii aayu main pride main laut jate hai
 However, sometimes they come early in the pride, especially when other lionesses have given birth to cubs at the same time
 For example, in a pride, lionesses often synchronize their reproductive cycle to help young children grow and drink milk, which feeds any or all of the females in the pride
 iske alaava, janm ke tulykaalan kaa phayda he ki shavakon kaa aakaar ant main lagbhag ek hi rahata he or is prakaar se unke astitv kii sambhaavnaaen lagbhag baraabar ho jaati hai
 If one lioness gives birth to children two months after the other lioness, udhaaharan ke liye, to chote shaavak apane bade bhaaiyon se bahut chote hote hai or bhojan se samay aksar bade shaavak un par haaavee ho jate hai- jiske parinamswaroop chote shavakon main bhukh se mrityu aam hoti he
 Apart from starvation, cub wrists also face other dangers, such as hunting by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles and snakes
 Even the buffalo drags the cubs to the place where the lioness was protecting them and kills them
 iske alaava, jab ek yaa adhik nae nar puraane nar ko pride se bedakhal kar dete hai, vijeta aksar chote shavakon ko maar daalate hai, shaayad kyonki maadaaen tab tak prajnak or grahi nahin banati hai jab tak unke shaavak paripakv na ho jaaen yaa mar na jaaen
 kul milakar lagbhag 80 pratishat shaavak do saal kii umr se pehle hi mar jate hai
 When the cubs initially come to their pride, they lack the confidence to face any adult lion other than their mother
 lekin, ve jald hi pride ke jivan main ghul mil jate hai, khud hi khelte hai yaa vayaskon ke saath khelnaa shuru kar dete hai
 Lionesses with their cubs are also tolerant of cubs of other lionesses, while lionesses without cubs are not tolerant
 shavakon ke prati nar singh kii sahishnutaa alag alag hoti he- kabhi kabhi, ek nar dhairya ke saath shaavak ko apni poonch yaa ayaal ke saath khilne kii anumati de detaa he, jabaki anya gurraa kar shaavak ko dur bhaga dete hai
 The milk is weaned after six to seven months
 nar singh 3 saal kii umr main paripakv ho jaataa he or 4 saal kii aayu main kisi anya pride se sambandhit nar ko chunauti dekar use pratisthapit karne kii kshamta praapt kar letaa he
 They begin to weaken between the ages of 10 and 15 if they have not been severely damaged while protecting their pride
 yah unke apane vansh ke paidaa hone or paripakv hone ke liye ek choti khidki chhod detaa he
 If they are capable of manufacturing at the time of the Pride, potentially, they may have more cubs that are maturing before being replaced
 ek sinhani aksar bahari nar se apane shavakon kii dridhtaa se raksha karti he, lekin aise prayaas kabhi kabhi hi safal ho pate hai
 Usually he kills all the cubs who are less than two years old
 ek sinhani ek nar kii tulana main kamjor or halki hoti he; safalataa kii sambhaavna tab bad jaati he jab teen chaar maaen ek nar kaa saamana karti hai
 Contrary to popular belief, only males are not evicted from their pride to become nomadic, although most females certainly persist with their birth pride
 haalanki, jab pride bahut bada ho jaataa he, maadaaon kii agali peedhee par dabaav daalaa jaataa he ki ve apana koi kshetra dhund len
 iske alaava, jab ek nayaa nar singh pride par kabja kar letaa he, chote singh, maadaa yaa nar, donon ko nikaala ja saktaa he
 Life is very difficult for a female nomad
 pride ke anya sadasyon kii suraksha ke bina, khanaabadosh sinhani apane shavakon ko paripakvata tak nahin pahunchaa sakati he,
 ek vaigyanik adhyayan kii report ke anusaar nar or maadaa donon sam langikta kaa vyavhaar bhi kar sakate hai
 Male lions can pair for several days and begin homosexual activity, in which affection, love, lads, etc
 are feared
 ek adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki lagbhag 8 pratishat mounting anya naron ke saath prekshit kii gayi he
 Female pairs are common in captivity, but have not been seen in the forest
 haalanki vayask singh ke prakritik parabhakshi nahin he, pramaan bataate hai ki adhikansh maanav ke dwaara yaa anya singhon ke dwaara maare jate hai
 This is especially true for male lions, who, as the chief guard of the pride, become more aggressive when exposed to competing males
 vastav main, ek nar 15 yaa 16 saal kii ek umr tak pahunch saktaa he yadi vah is baat kaa prabandhan kar le ki koi bahari nar use bedakhal na kare
 zyaadaatar nar 10 saal se adhik jinda nahin rahete hai
 This is the reason that the average age of a male lion is less than that of a lioness in the forest
 haalanki, donon hi lingon ke sadsy doosar singhon ke dwaara ghayal kiye ja sakate hai yaa maare ja sakate hai, jab ativyapee kshetron ke do pride sangharsh karte hai
 Various species of tick commonly infect the ears, neck, and neck regions of most lions
 tinia vansh ke feetakrimi kii prajatiyon ke vyask rup aanton main se nikaale gaye hai, singh inhen antilop ke maance ke saath antargrahit kar lete hai
 The lions were attacked by a stationary fly in 1962 at the Ngorongoro Crater; As a result of which the lions were covered with blood, they were eroded
 singhon ne apane aap ko mackhiyon ke kaatane se bachaane ke liye asafalataapurvak pedo par chadhana shuru kar diya or hyena ke bilon main ghusna shuru kar diya; bahut se khatm ho gaye, aabaadi 70 se 15 tak gir gayi
 Recently 6 lions were killed in 2001
 singh vishesh rup se kaid main, canin distemper virus, phelline immuno defishiency virus or phelline sankramak peritonitis se sankramit ho jate hai
 CDV is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores; In 1994, many lions in Serengeti National Park saw neurological symptoms such as Caesars
 During this outbreak, many lions died of pneumonia and encephalitis
 FIV, jo HIV ke samaan he, haalanki singhon par vipareet prabhaav ke liye nahin janaa gaya he, par gharelu billiyon main kaaphi chintajanak prabhaav paidaa karata he
 Hence systematic testing is recommended in captive lions
 yah kai junglee singh aabaadiyon main ucch se andemic aavruti ke saath hota he, lekin adhikanshtya asia or namib ke singhon main anupasthit hota he
 ' aaraam karte samay, singh kai prakaar ke vyavhaar se samajikaran prardashit karata he or jantu kii bhaavnaatmak gatividhiyaan bahut adhik viksit ho gayin hai
 The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and licking, which have been compared to grooming in primates
 sir ragadnaa, kisi ke maathe ko ragadnaa, chehre or gardan ko duusare singh ke vipareet lagaana-abhivadan kaa swarup he, yah aksar kisi jhagade yaa mukaable ke baad dekha jaataa he yaa ek duusare se alag rahane ke baad milane par dekha jaataa he
 Males rub the other males while cubs and females rub females
 saamaajik chaat aksar sir ragad ke saath agranukram main hota he, yah aamtaur par aapas main hota he or praptakarta khushi vyakt karata he
 The most common parts of the body to be licked are the head and neck, which have arisen from utility, a lion cannot lick these areas individually
 singh chehre ke bhav or sharir kii mudraaen bhi pradarshit karte hai jo drishy sanketon kaa kaam karti hai
 His vocal repertoire is also large; Variations in the intensity and pitch of sounds, rather than discrete signals, seem to be the focus of communication
 singh kii awaajon main shaamil hai gurrana, puring, hissing, kaphing yaa khansna, mioing, woofing or garjana yaa dahaadna
 singh kii dahaad ek bahut vishisht tareeke se hoti he, yah kuch gahare lambe garjan se shuru hoti he or chote chote garjan kii shrinkhlaayein iske baad utpann kii jaati hai
 At night they often roar; The sound that can be heard from a distance of 8 km is used to detect the presence of animals
 singh kii dahaad kisi bhi badi billi se tej hoti he
 The intensity and complexity of the relationship between areas where lions and spotted hyenas live together is unique
 singh or spoted hyena donon sheersh ke shikari hai jo samaan shikaar se bhojan praapt karte hai or isliye ek duusare ke pratyaksh pratispardhi hai
 Thus, they often fight each other and steal dead prey by each other
 haalanki hyena ko singh kii shikaar kii kshamtaaon se laabh uthaane vaala, ek avasarwaadi mritjivi mana jaataa he
 Often the opposite is also true
 tanzania ke ngorongoro cretar main, spoted hyena kii jansankhya singh kii tulana main bahut adhik he jo apane bhojan kaa adhikansh hissaa hyena ke shikaar ko chura kar praapt karte hai
 Fights between the two species, however, end in a fight over food
 pashuon main, aam taur par dekha jaataa he ki anya prajatiyon ko kshetreey simaaon ke bheetar sweekaar nahin kiya jaataa he
 Hyenas and lions are exceptions to this; They set boundaries against each other, as if they were members against their own species
 Male lions in particular are very fierce towards hyenas and have been seen to hunt and kill hyenas but do not eat
 iske vipareet, hyena singh ke shavakon ke pramukh shikari hai or sinhani ko sataate hai
 However, healthy adult males, even one, try to avoid them at all costs
 singh kshetra main chote phelline jaise chita or tendua par prabhavi hote hai, jahaan ve sampaitruk hote hai
 They steal dead prey from them and kill their cubs and even do not leave the adults when they get the chance
 chitah ke paas, singh yaa anya shikariyon dwaara, apane mrit shikaar ke churaae jane kii 50 pratishat sambhaavna hoti he
 Lions are the main killers of cheetah cubs, of which up to 90 percent die in the first week of their lives by attacks from other predators
 chitah din ke bhinn samay par shikaar ke dwaara pratispardhaa se bachate hai or apane shavakon ko moti jhaadiyon main chhupate hai
 Leopards also use a similar tactic, but they have a greater ability to survive on small prey than lions or leopards
 saath hi, chitah, tendue pedo par chadh sakate hai or apane shavakon ko singhon se bachane ke liye pedo kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 However, lionesses sometimes succeed in climbing trees to get the prey dead by leopards
 isi prakaar, singh africa junglee kutton par prabhavi hote hai, ve naa keval unka mrit shikaar le lete hai, balki chote or vyask donon prakaar ke kutton kaa shikaar bhi karte hai 
 nil magaramchh ekmaatr sampaitruk shikari he jo singh kaa shikaar kar saktaa he
 Depending on the size of the crocodile and lion, either of them can lose prey or depend on the other
 singh bhoomi par ghoomane vaale magaramchh ko maarane ke liye jane jate hai, jabaki iskaa vipareet bhi satya he jab singh magaramchh se yukt jal nikaay main pravesh kar jate hai, is tathy kaa pramaan tab mila jab ek magaramchh ke pet par singh ke panje ke nishaan paae gaye
 In Africa, lions are found on savanna grasslands with distributed Acacea trees, which give shade; Their habitat in India is a mixture of dry savanna forest and very dry deciduous scrub forest

 Currently habitat damage and conflict with humans are the biggest threats to this species
 shesh aabaadiyaan aksar bhugolic rup se ek duusare se alag ho jaati hai, jo antarprajnan kaa kaaran banati hai or iske parinaam swarup anuvanshik bhinnata main kami aati he
 That is why the lion has been considered a sensitive species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, while the Asian subspecies has been considered a serious threat

 The number of mature members in West Africa has been estimated by two recent surveys at 850–1,160, with disagreement over the size of the largest member population in West Africa: 100 to 400 in the early-singou ecosystem of Burkina Faso
 The range of lions has been estimated
 africa or asian donon singhon ke sarankshan ke liye rashtriya parkon or game rigerv kii sthapana or rakh rakhaav kii aavashyaktaa he; sarvottam gyaat main hai namibia kaa etosha rashtriya udyaan, tanzania main serengeti rashtriya udyaan or purvi dakshin africa main kruger rashtriya udyaan
 Outside these areas, the lion's issues with livestock and interactions with the people usually resulted in earlier extinctions

 wildlink International, in collaboration with the University of Oxford, launched its ambitious international Barbary lion project, which aimed to identify and breed Barbary lions in captivity in a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, which would eventually regenerate the lions
 After finding a decrease in lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts have been made, including lion conservation, to prevent this decline
 Lions are one of the species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated effort being made by the Association of Juice and Aquarium to increase its chances of survival

 While lions do not usually hunt people, some prefer to hunt humans; The most well-known cases are Savo Nar Bhakshi, where in 1898, 28 railway employees who were building the Kenya Uganda Railway in nine months became victims of lions while building a bridge over the Savo River in Kenya
 or 1991 main mphuve nar bhakshi, jisane zambia main langwa nadi ghati main chah logon ko maar daalaa

 Infirmity theory, including dental caries, is not favored by all researchers; An analysis of the teeth and jaws of male hermit lions kept in the museum collection suggests that dental caries may explain some of the events, a more likely cause of lion prey on humans, a lack of prey in human dominant areas
 In their analysis of Savo and common male beggars, Karbis Paterhans and Noske considered that sick and injured animals increase their chances of being male eaters

 In April 2004, a male bhakti Singh was killed by sports scouts in southern Tanzania
 It is believed that it killed at least 35 consecutive people in the region of the Rufji delta shore, Dr
 Rolf D
 Baldus, who is the GTZ Wildlife Program Coordinator, remarked that the lion may possibly be a human prey
 It has been said that there was a big boil under its cervix, which broke out in many places

 Mission work in Samoa began in the late 1830s by John Williams of the London Missionary Society, who came to Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti
 By that time, the image of the Samoans had become barbaric and warlike, as there were violent clashes between local residents and French, British, German and American forces
 By the end of the nineteenth century these forces considered Samoa a refueling station for coal-fired ships and suitable for whale hunting

 The new Fa'alupega of German Samoa clearly required the oaths to Malietoa Tanunafili and Tupua Tamasse, and thus the new Fa'alupega, which replaced the historical Fa'alupega of Samoa, is the following: "tulouna e laana maiesitete le kaisaa o le tupu maamlu o lo tatou maalo kasialika aoaao

 yah suchi asia ke deshon ke shaharon kii he:- Template: City by continent computer virus yaa computer vishaanu ek computer program he jo apni anulipi kar saktaa he or upyogkarta kii anumati ke bina ek computer ko sankramit kar saktaa he or upyogkarta ko iskaa pataa bhi nahin chalata he
 The term "virus" is also commonly used in reference to various types of malware and adware programs, although it is sometimes mistaken
 mul virus anulipiyon main parivartan kar saktaa he, yaa anulipiyaan khud apane aap main parivartan kar sakati hai, jaisaa ki ek roopantarit virus main hota he
 a virus can spread from one computer to another only when its host is brought to an uninfected computer, for example by a user sending it to a network or the Internet, or by removing it from a removable medium such as a floppy disk, CD , Or by bringing on a USB drive
 Simultaneously, the virus can spread to other computers through infected files on a file system or network system that can be opened on other computers
 Sometimes the word virus was used for computer worm and Trojan hoses
 goes
 ek keeda anya computaron main khud failaa saktaa he ise poshi ke ek bhagya ke rup main sthanantarit hone kii zarurat nahin hoti he or ek trogen horse ek aisi fil he jo hanirahit prathit hoti he
 Worms and Trojan horses can damage a computer system's data, functional performance, or networking during performance
 saamaanya taur par, ek keedaa vastav main system ke hardware yaa software ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaata, jabaki kam se kam siddhant rup main, ek trogen pelod, nishpaadan ke dor kisi bhi prakaar kaa nuksaan pahunchne main sakasham hota he
 When the program is not running, nothing appears but the Trojan horse enters as soon as the infected code runs
 yahi kaaran he ki logon ke liye virus or anya mailaware ko khojna bahut hi kathin hota he or isiilie unhen spyware program or panjikaran prakriya kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 Nowadays, most personal computers are connected to the Internet and the locker area network and the local area network facilitates the process of spreading corrupted code
 aaj kaa virus network sevaao kaa bhi laabh uthaa saktaa he jaise world wide web, i mail, twarit sandesh or sanchika saajha pranaliyaan virason or keedon ko failane main madad karti hai
 In addition, some sources use an alternative terminology, in which a virus is a form of self-duplicating malware
 kuch melware, vinaashkari prograamon, sanchikaon ko delit karne, yaa hard discs kii punah formating karne ke dwaara computer ko kshati pahuchane ke liye program kiye jate hai
 Other malware programs are not built for any damage, but simply duplicate themselves and perhaps make their presence known by a text, video, or audio message
 yahan tak kii ye kam ashubh mailaware program bhi computer upyogkarta ke liye samasyaayen utpann kar sakate hai
 
they usually take control of the computer memory used by legitimate programs
 iske parinamswaroop, ve aksar aniyamit vyavhaar kaa kaaran hote hai or system ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Additionally, many malware are prone to bugs, and these bugs can damage the system or cause data loss
 kai siaidi program aise program hai jo upyogkarta dwaara downlod kiye gaye hai or har baar pop ap kiye jate hai
 As a result, the speed of the computer is greatly reduced but it is very difficult to find and stop the problem
 sabase pehla virus kreeper tha jo arapanet, par khoja gaya, jo 1970 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main internet se pehle aayaa tha
 It was spread by the TENEX operating system and could use any connected modem to control and infect the computer
 yah sandesh pradarshit kar saktaa he ki "main kreeper hoon; agar pakad sakate ho to mujhe pakado"
 yah afvaah thi ki reeper program, jo iske kuch hi samay baad prakat hota he or kreeper kii pratiyaan banaata he or unhen hataa detaa he, ise sambhavatya kreeper ke nirmaataa ke dwaara khed patr main likhaa gaya he
 There is a common belief that a program called "rother J" was the first computer virus to appear "in the wild" —it was created outside a computer or in a laboratory, but this claim was false
 anya haal hi ke virason ke liye jane-maane computer virason or keedon kii samay rekha dekhen
lekin yah " ghar main " computaron ko sankramit karne vaala pehla virus tha
 Written by Richard Scranta, in 1982, it integrated itself with the Apple DOS 3
3 operating system and was spread by floppy disks
 The virus was originally a joke created by a high school student and was intended as a game
 Put on a floppy disk
 iske 50 wein upyog par Elk Cloner virus sakriy ho gaya, jisane computer ko sankramit kiya or yah ek choti kavita ko prardashit karata tha " Elk cloner:the program with a personality"
in di wild pehla pisi virus ek boot kshetra kaa virus tha jo brain Brain) kehalaata tha, ise faruk alvi bros ke dwaara 1986 main banaaya gaya, tathaa lahore, pakistan ke baahar sanchalit kiya gaya
 They created this alleged virus to prevent theft of copies of the software they had created
 However, analysts claimed that the Ashar virus, a species of the brain, probably pre-dated it based on the code inside the virus
 isse pehle kii computer network vyapak hote adhikansh virus hathaaye jane yogya madhyam, vishesh rup se flopy discs par fail gaye
 In the early days, regular exchange of information and programs was done by floppies among many users of personal computers
 kai virus in discon par upasthit sankramit prograamon se faile, jabaki kuch ne apane aap ko discs ke boot kshetra main install kar liya, isse yah sunishchit ho gaya kii jab upyogkarta computer ko discs se boot karegaa to yah anjaane main hi chal jayega
us samay ke pi si pehle flopi se boot karne kaa prayaas karte the, yadi koi flopi drive main rah gai he
 This was the most successful transition strategy until the use of floppies was reduced, making it easier to create viruses in the wild boot sector
 paaramparik computer virus 1980 ke dashak main ubhare, aisa nijee computer kaa upyog badhane ke kaaran hua or iske parinaam swarup BBS or modem kaa upyog, tathaa software kaa aadan-pradaan bad gaya
 Bulletin board software exchanges directly spread Trojan horse programs and viruses were created to infect popular commercial software
 shairwayre or bootleg BBS ke virus ke liye aam vaahak the
 In the "pirate Scene" of Hobists, a virus that contains illegal copies of retail software can send a web address link as an instant message to all contacts on an infected machine
 yadi praptakarta, yah sochataa he ki link ek mitra se he, vah web sait par link kaa anusaran karata he, sait par upasthit virus is nae computer ko sankramit karne main samarth ho saktaa he or apana prasar karne lagata he
 The latest site of the virus family is the cross-site scripting virus
 This virus emerged from research and was demonstrated academically in 2005
 yah virus kros sait patakatha kaa upyog karke prasaarit hota he
 Since 2005 in the wild, there have been many examples of cross-site scripting viruses, the most notable affected sites being myspace and Yahoo
 apane aap kii anulipi karne ke liye, ek virus ko code kaa nishpaadan karne kii tathaa smriti par likhane kii anumati honi chahie is kaaran se, kai virus apane aap ko nishpaadan yogya filon se sanlagn kar lete hai jo uchit program kaa hissaa ho saktaa he
 If a user tries to start an infected program, then it is possible that the code of the virus is executed first
 Viruses can be divided into two types, based on their behavior and their performance
 Resident viruses quickly find other cells that can be infected, infect these targets, and eventually control application programs
 But transfer what they have infected
 nivasee virus poshi kii talash nahin karte hai jab ve shuru hote hai
 Instead, a resident virus loads itself into memory upon execution and transfers control to the host program
 virus prishth bhoomi main sakriy rahata he or nae poshiyon ko sankramit karata he jab in filon ko anya prograamon yaa khud oparating system ke dwaara acces kiya jaataa he
 It is believed that the non-resident virus consists of a finder module and a replication module
 khojak modul sankraman hetu nai filein khojane ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 For each new executable file, the finder module attacks, calling the duplication module to infect the file
 nivasee virus main ek anulipi modul hota he jo ek anivaasee virus ke dwaara niojit anulipi modul ke samaan hota he
 Although this module is not called by the finder module
 iske bajaay, virus anulipi modul ko smriti main lod karata he jab iskaa nishpaadan hota he or yah sunishchit kar letaa he ki har baar jab oparating system ek nishchit aaparishan kaa pradarshan karata he to is modul kaa nishpaadan hota he
 For example, each time the operating system executes a file, duplicate modules can be called
 is maamle main, virus computer par nishpadit hone vaale prayek upyukt program ko sankramit kar detaa he
 Occasionally, resident viruses are further subdivided into two categories, one acute infectious and the other slow infective
 The fast infectious is designed to infect as many files as possible
 For example, an acute infectious access infects every possible host file
 yah ek virus rodhi soft ware ke liye ek vishesh samasya he, chunki ek virus scanner har sambhav poshi sanchika ko akses kar legaa jab yah system kaa vyapak scan karata he
 If the virus scanner fails to notice that such a virus is present in memory, the virus attacks the scanner from behind and thus infects all the files being scanned
 teevr sankramak apane prasar ke liye teevr sankraman dar par bharosa karte hai
 The disadvantage of this method is that infecting multiple files makes it more likely to be detected, as the virus slows down the computer or performs many suspicious actions that can be detected by anti-virus software
 duusari or dhime sankramak, is prakaar se banaaye jate hai ki ve poshi ko an-aavruth rup se sankramit karte hai
 For example, some slow infects infect files only when they are being copied
 dhime sankramak ki simit kriya ki vajah se unka pataa lagaana aasaan nahin hota he: ve computer ko bahut adhik dhimaa nahin karte hai, par baar-baar virus virdohi soft ware ko jhatka dete hai jise prograamon ke sandigdh vyavhaar ke dwaara pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Slow infectives don't seem very successful, virason ne bhinn prakaar ke prasar madhyamon yaa poshiyon ko lakshya banaaya he
 This list cannot end: pdfs, jaise HTML, durbhaavnapurna code se sambandhit ho saktaa he
 What some virus writers have written has no significance
 EXE vistaar ke ant parofngh, ummid he ki upyogkarta vishwast fil ke prakaar par ruk jayega, vah is baat par dhyaan nahin degaa kii computer antim prakaar kii sanchika ke saath prarambh hoga
 trogen harse ) dekhen To avoid detection by the user, some viruses perform various types of deception
 kuch puraane virus, vishesh rup se MS - DOS manch par, yah sunishchit kar lete hai ki jab sanchika ko virus ke dwaara sankramit kiya jaataa he to poshi sanchika ke " antim baar sanshodhit " hone kii dinaank bani rahati he
 Although this approach does not fool anti-virus software, especially those that maintain dates for cyclic redundancy checks on file changes 
 kuch virus apane aakaar ko badhaaye bina or sanchikaon ko kshati pahuchaye bina sanchikaon ko sankramit kar sakate hai
 They do this by overwriting unused fields of executable files
 ye cavity virus kehalaata he
 For example, the CIH virus, or the Chernobyl virus, infects portable executable files
 kyonki un sanchikaon main kai khaali sthaan the, virus jo 1 KB lambaai kaa tha, sanchika ke aakar main nahin judaa
kuch virus virus virdohi software ke kaary ko khatm karke apane aap ko prakat nahin hone dete hai, isse pehle ki vah uskaa pataa laga le
kyonki computer or oparating system adhik viksit or jatil ho rahe hai, chupaane ki puraani takneekon ko navinikrut karne yaa pratisthapit karne ki aavashyaktaa he
 To protect a computer from viruses, the demand may be that the file system migrates to the detailed and explicit permission for all types of file access
 ek virus ke liye aage failane ke liye poshiyon ko sankramit karne ki zarurat hoti he
 In some cases, infecting a host may be a bad idea
 For example, many anti-virus programs check the integrity of their code
 isliye aise prograamon kaa sankraman is sambhaavna ko badhayega ki is virus kaa pataa chal gaya he
 For this reason, some viruses do not infect programs that are part of anti-virus software
 ek anya prakaar kaa poshi jisase virus kabhi kabhi bachane ki koshish karata he vah he bat sanchikaaye
bat sanchikaaye ve sanchikaaye hai jo ki vishesh rup se virus virdohi software yaa khud virus virdohi peshewaron ke dwaara ek virus ke dwaara sankramit hone ke liye banaai gai hai
 These files can be created for different reasons, all of them are related to virus detection
 chunki bat sanchikaon kaa upyog virus kaa pataa lagane main yaa jaanch ko sambhav banane main kiya jaataa he, virus ke dwaara sankraman nahin hone kaa laabh uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Viruses typically do this by avoiding virus programs, such as small program files or programs that have specific patterns of 'garbage instructions'
 a related strategy to make batting difficult is sparse infection
 Sometimes, sparse Infectious do not infect a host file which may be a suitable candidate for infection in other conditions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek virus yadrichhik aadhaar par tay kar saktaa he ki ek sanchika ko sankramit karnaa he yaa nahin, yaa ek virus saptaah ke vishesh dinon main hi poshi sanchikaon ko sankramit kar saktaa he
 Some viruses try to trick anti-virus software by requesting the operating system
 virus virdohi software sanchika ko padhne kaa anurodh karata he or yah anurodh OS ke bajaay virus ko jaataa he, is prakaar se ek virus apane aap ko chupa letaa he
 The anti-virus software now rolls over the uninfected version of the file, making it appear that the file is "clean"
 aadhunik virus virdohi software ke paas virus kii chori kaa pataa lagane ke liye kai takneekein hai
 The only reliable method of preventing theft is to boot through a medium that is clean
 adhikansh virus virdohi program saadhaaran prograamon ke bheetar virus praturup khojane ki koshish karte hai ise tathakthith virus ke hastakshar kaha jaataa he
 a signature is a figurative byte pattern, which is a part of a particular virus or virus family
 yadi ek virus scanner ek sanchika main aisa praturup khoj letaa he, yah upyogkarta ko suchit kar detaa he ki sanchika sankramit he
 Users can then delete this file, or "clean" or "fix" the infected file
 kuch virus aisi takneekon kaa upyog karte hai ki jo hastakshar ke dwaara iskaa pataa lagane ko mushkil hi nahin balki asambhav bana detaa he
 These viruses change their code on each infection
 arthath prayek sankramit sanchika main virus kii ek alag prajati hoti he
 a more advanced method for encrypting viruses is the use of simple encryption
 In this case, the virus consists of a small decrypting module and an encrypted copy of the virus's code
 yadi prayek sankramit sanchika ke liye virus ek alag kunjee se ancrypted he, to virus kaa keval ek bhaag sthir bana rahata he vah he decrypting modul, jo ke ant se sanlagn hoga
is maamle main, ek virus scinar hastakshar kaa upyog karke sidhe virus kaa pataa nahin laga saktaa, lekin yah fir bhi dicripting modul kaa pataa laga saktaa he, jo sambhav virus kii abhi bhi apratyaksh jaanch kar saktaa he
 Since these will be keys stored on the infected host, it is actually possible to decode the last virus, but this is probably not necessary, since the self-modified code is so rare that it causes the virus scanner to at least record the suspicious file
 Can
 ek puraane lekin compact, ancripshan main ek sthir virus ki prayek bit xoring shaamil he, taaki oparation kaa dohraan keval dicripshan ke liye ho
yah sandigdh code he jo apane aap ko sanshodhit karata he, isliye kai virus paribhaashaon main ancripshan / dicripshan hastakshar kaa ek bhaag ho saktaa he
 Polymorphic code was the first technology that posed a serious threat to the virus screener
 Like regular encrypted viruses, a polymorphic virus infects files with its encrypted code, which is decoded by a decryption module
 bahurupi virus ke maamle main, yah dicripshan modul bhi prayek sankraman par sanshodhit hota he
 Therefore properly written polymorphic viruses have no parts that are similar in infections, making it difficult to detect using signatures
 virus virdohi software ek pratidwandvi kaa upyog karke decrypting ke dwaara iskaa pataa laga saktaa he, yaa ancrypted virus sharir ke sankhyikeey praturup vishleshan ke dwaara iskaa pataa laga saktaa he
 To enable polymorphic code, a virus must have a polymorphic engine somewhere in its encrypted body
 See polymorphic code for technical detail on how such engines work
 Some viruses require polymorphic code to work in this way In that it mainly binds the rate of mutation of the virus
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek virus keval kuch hi samay main utparivartit hone ke liye program kiya jaataa he, yaa ise is prakaar se program kiya ja saktaa he ki jab ye computer par aisi sanchika ko sankramit kar rahaa ho jisamen pehle se virus kii anulipiyaan ho, to yah utparivartan se batch sake
 jise dhime bahurupi code kaa upyog karne kaa laabh yah he ki isse virus virdohi peshewar ke liye virus kaa pratinidhi kaa namoona praapt karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, kyonki bat sanchikaaye jo ek baar chalane main sankramit ho jaati hai, unamem praroopik rup se virus kaa samaan namoona hoga
 ise yah sambhaavna bad jaayegi ki virus scanner ke dwaara ki gai jaanch avishwasaneey hogi or yah ho saktaa he ki virus ke kuch udhaaharan jaanch kaa pataa lagane main sakasham na hon
 Some viruses rewrite themselves each time they infect a new executable to avoid detection by simulation
 virus jo aisi takanic kaa upyog karte hai ve roopantarit kehalaate hai
 a modified engine is required to make the conversion possible
 ek roopantarit virus aamtaur par bahut bada or jatil hota he
 For example, the W32 / Simile contains more than 14000 characters of group language code, 90% of which is part of the converted engine
 jaise ek aabaadi main anuvanshik vividhta ke kam hone par usamen ek maatr rog kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he, samaan rup se ek network par software system ki vividhta kii bhi virus kii vinaashkari kshamta ko simit karti he
 This became a topic of special consideration in 1990 when Microsoft gained market dominance in desktop operating systems and office suites
 microsoft software ke upyogkarta or internet explorer ) vishesh rup se virus ke prasar ke liye kamjor hai
 The reason why Microsoft software is targeted by viruses is their desktop dominance and is often criticized for many mistakes and holes for virus writers
 samanvit or gaiyr ekikrut microsoft anuprayog or sanchika pranali ke acces ke saath bhashaaon ki patakathaon ke anuprayog, or netwarking lakshanon ke saath anuprayog) bhi vishesh rup se jokhim yukt hai
 Although Windows is the most popular operating system for virus writers, some viruses also exist on other platforms
 koi bhi oparating system jo chalane ke liye tisare paksh ke program ko anumati de saktaa he vah saidhantik rup se virus ko chalaa saktaa he
 Some operating systems are less secure than others
 Unix-based oss only allow their users to execute within a secure space under their own instructions
 internet aadhaarit ek shodh se pataa chalaa ki aise maamle bhi the jab logon ne jaan-boojh kar ek virus ko dianlod karne ke liye ek vishesh batan ko dabaaya
ek suraksha form f-secure ne ek 6 maah kaa abhiyaan google aidwards par chalaaya jisane kaha "kya aapkaa pi si virus mukt he?yah yahan sankramit praapt karen ! " 
iskaa parinaam tha 409 clic
2006 main apekshaakrit kuch suraksha ke tareeke thejo mike OS x ko lakshya bana rahe the ke saath) 
puraane appal oparating system ke liye virus ki ek sankhya jo mike oes clasik ke naam se jaani jaati he, wo alag alag sroton main bahut alag hoti he, appal ke saath kaha jaataa he ki keval chaar prakaar ke jane maane virus hote hai or swatantra sutron ke anusaar 63 virus ke rup hai
 It is safe to say that Macs are less likely to be targeted because of lower market share, and thus a Mac-specific virus can only infect a small proportion of computers
 
mex or windos ke bich virus kaa jokhim mukhya bikri bindu he, ek yah ki Apple unke ek mike praapt karen vigyaapan main kaam letaa he
 According to this, Mex also has security issues similar to Microsoft Windows, although no one in the wild has successfully taken full advantage of it
 windos or unics main samaan patakatha kii kshamta he, lekin jab unics swaabhaavik rup se saamaanya upyogkartaaon ko oparating system vaataavaran ke liye parivartan karne ke liye acces karne se roktaa he, vindos kii purani pratiyaan jaise vindos 95 or 98 aisa nahin karti
1997 main, jab ek "bliss " naamak virus Linux ke liye jari kiya gaya tha --pramukh virus virdohi vikritaon ne ek chetavanee jari kii unics kii tarah ke system thik vidos kii tarah virus kaa shikaar ban sakate hai
 Bliss virus can be considered symbolic of viruses - unlike on Unix systems -
 Bliss requires that the user run it explicitly and that it can only infect programs that are modified by the user
 Can
 vindos upyogkarta ke vipareet, adhikansh unics upyogkarta kisi software ko instul karne ke alaava kisi vyavasthaapak upyogkarta ke rup main log in nahin karte: yahan tak ki yadi ek upyogkarta virus ko chalaata he to bhi yah oparating system ko nuksaan nahin kar saktaa he
 The Bliss virus never became widespread and remained primarily a subject of research interest
 Its creator later posted its source code to Usenet, allowing researchers to learn how it mitigated
 chunki system strot kaa anaadhikrut upyog rokane ke liye software ko aksar suraksha vyavastha ke saath dijin kiya jaataa he, kai virus ek system yaa anuprayog main software bag ko failane main madad karte hai
 Software development strategies that produce a large number of bugs also normally enable efficient exploitation
 kai upyog karta virus virdohi software install karte hai, jo computer downlod ke baad yaa nishpaadan yogya ke chalane ke baad gyaat virus kaa pataa laga lete hai yaa use nasht kar dete hai
 There are two common methods that an anti-virus software application employs to detect viruses
 virus kii jaanch kii pehali or sabase saamaanya vidhi he virus ke hastakshar paribhaasha kii suchi kaa upyog
yah computer kii smriti ke avyavon or boot kshetra ) or sthaayee yaa asthaayee drivon par sangruhit sanchikaon kii jaanch ke dwaara, kaary karata he tathaa in sanchikaon kii tulana gyaat virus ke "hastakshar" ke database ke kilaaf kii jaati he
 The disadvantage of this method of investigation is that the user is only protected from viruses that keep updating their previous definitions
 duusari vidhi he anumaani kalan vidhi jisamen saamaanya vyavhaar par aadhaarit virason kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 This method has the ability to detect viruses for which anti-virus companies still have to create signatures
 kuch virus virdohi program khuli hui sanchikaon ko scan karne main sakasham hote hai saath hi samaan tareeke se 'on the fly' bheje gaye or praapt kiye gaye i-mels ko bhi scan kar sakate hai
 This is called "on-access scanning"
 virus virdohi software poshi software ki virus ko preshit karne kii kshamta ko parivartit nahin karata he
 Users should update their software regularly for patch security holes
 Anti-virus software also needs to be updated regularly to prevent modern threats
 Regular backup of data on different media Can reduce the damage caused by viruses, either unconnected to the system, kept, or for other reasons such as a different file system Can not be opened for use not or only kept read-only
 is tarah, yadi ek virus ke madhyam se data kho diya he, koi bhi byaap kaa upyog karke phir se shuru kar saktaa he
 If a backup session is closed on optical media such as cds and dvds, it becomes read-only and can no longer be infected with the virus
 isi tarah, boot yogya par ek oparating system kaa upyog computer ko shuru karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, yadi sthapit aaparating system upyog hin ho gaya he
 Another method is to use different operating systems on different file systems
 a virus is unlikely to affect both
 data byaap bhi bhinn sanchika tantron par daalaa ja saktaa he
 For example, Linux requires special software to write to an NTFS partition, so if no one installs the software and uses a separate installation of MS Windows to perform a backup on an NTFS partition, the backup Any version of Linux must be protected
 Likewise, MS Windows cannot read file systems such as ext3, so if one typically uses MS Windows Ta is, backups can be made on an ext3 partition using a Linux installation
 ek baar ek computer jab virus se samjhauta kar letaa he, to saamanyatya oparating system ko fir se puri tarah se install kiye bina samaan computer kaa upyog jari rakhana asurakshit hota he
 However, there are several options that are present after the virus arrives in the computer
 ye kriyaayein virus ke prakaar kii gambhirtha par nirbhar karti hai
 On Windows Me, Windows XP and Windows Vista is a tool known as System Restore that restores the registry and complex system file for the previous check point
 aksar ek virus ek system ko heng kar detaa he or ek isi ke baad se fir se boot hone par system ke ristor bindu main usee din se samasya aegi
pichley dinon se ristor bindu ko diya gaya kaam karnaa hota he, ab virus sangrahit sanchikaon ko sankramit nahin kar paata he
 However, some viruses disable system restore and other important tools such as task manager and command prompt
 ek virus jo aisa karata he uskaa udahaaran he ciadoor
prashaskon ke paas bhinn kaarnon ke liye simit upyogkartaaon se aise aujaaron ko niskriy karne ke vikalp uplabdh hai
 The virus modifies the registry to do this, not only when the administrator is controlling the computer, all of this prevents users from accessing the tools
 jab ek sankramit aujaar sakriy hota he to yah ek sandesh detaa he "aapke prashaasak ke dwaara task menager ko aksham kar diya gaya he
 "even if the program the user is trying to open is the administrator
 upyogkarta jo microsoft oparating system ko chalaa rahaa he, ek mukt scan chalaane ke liye microsoft kii website par ja saktaa he, yadi unke paas unka 20 ankon kii panjikaran sankhya he
 Reinstalling the operating system is a different way of virus removal
 isamen saadhaaran rup se OS vibhaajan kii punah formating or iske mul madhyam se OS ko install karnaa shaamil he
 Or a partition with a clean backup image can be visualized or taken with Acronis)
 The advantage of this method is that it is simpler to perform, faster than running multiple anti-virus scans, and Also guarantees to remove malware
 Downsides main anya sabhi software or oparating system kaa punah install karnaa shaamil he
 User data can be backed up by booting a live CD or placing the hard drive on another computer and booting from that computer's operating system
 vbfjg This is the last Grand Slam tennis competition of the year held in New York City in the US
 pehali baar yah pratiyogita sanyukt rajya america main 1881 main agast ke maheene main newport main kheli gai
 It was held in Newport until 1918
 chelenz round 1911 main hataa diya gaya
 Only members of the club associated with the American Federation could participate in this event
 mahilaon kaa ekal pehali baar 1887 main philadelphia main khelaa gaya
 In 1919, the competition was relocated to Forrest Hill West Side Tennis Club, New York
 1974 tak yah pratiyogita ghaas par hoti thi, 1975 se 1977 ke bich main yah pratiyogita clay court par hui
 The contest opened in 1970
 yah pratiyogita taai brake ko apnaane vaali pehali mukhya pratiyogita thi
 The US Open moved for the final time in 1978, with the Flushing Meadows Stadium, in the Queens district of New York, having the honor of hosting the fourth and final Grand Slam event of the year since then
 The clay courts have been replaced by Decoturf hard court surfaces
 The US Open has the largest centre court in the world, with room for 23,000 spectators in the Arthur Ashe Stadium, opened in 1997
 In 1999, the old centre court was renovated and renamed the Louis Armstrong Stadium
 The location of places, cities, countries, mountains, rivers, etc
 of a part of the surface of the earth in small form on paper with the help of scale is called mapping
 maanchitr do shabdon maan or chitra se mil kar bana he jiskaa arth kisi maap yaa mulya ko chitra dwaara pradarshit karnaa he
 In contrast to the way a microscope enlarges a small object, maps represent a large terrain in a small way so that at a glance the geographical information and their interrelations can be given
 maanchitr ko nakshaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Nowadays maps are not limited to the earth, or the surface of the earth, or any real object
 udhaaharan ke liye chandramaa yaa mangal grah kii sataha kaa maanchitr banaaya ja saktaa he; kisi vichaar yaa avadharana kaa maanchitr banaaya ja saktaa he; mastishk kaa maanchitran kiya ja rahaa he
 a map is an illustration or transcription map of the earth or other planets, satellites, or any part thereof and the boundaries of specific practical, or symbolic, symbols according to the projection of a fixed value or scale and latitude and longitude lines on a flat surface
 at: praaia: maanchitr kisi bade kshetra kaa chota pratinidhi rupachithran he, jisamen ankit prayek bindu maanchitr kshetra par sthit bindu kaa sangat bindu hota he
 In this way static or spatial coherence is established in the map and the mapped area
 maanchitr par bhuakriti yaa vastusthiti ke pradarshan ke nimitt prayukt prayek chitra, chihn yaa akruti ek vishisht sthiti kaa bodh karaate hai or prachlan evam upyog main rahane ke kaaran in rudh chihnon kaa ek sarvamaanya antarrashtriya vidhaan sa ban gaya he
 By the use of such markings, the marked maps of any language become admissible and readable even without knowledge of that language
 uddeshivishesh kii drushti se vibhinn vidhiyon dwaara rekhaon, shabdon, chihnon, aadi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jisase maanchitr kii grahyata evam upadeyata bad jaati he
 In the past few decades, the art of map-making has progressed considerably, especially in the Second World War and later, and it has become possible to document the various types of facts in the map with a minimum of jargon
 kisi maanchitr main kitne tathyon kaa grahya samavesh samuchit rup se kiya ja saktaa he, yah maanchitr ke paimaane, prakshep tathaa maanchitrkaar kii vaidhanik kshamta evam kalatmak bodh aadi par nirbhar karata he
 The map actually presents a two-dimensional image of the stereoscopic surface
 maanchitr main kisi kshetra ke vaise rup kaa pradarshan kiya jaataa he jaisaa vah upar se dekhne main prathit hota he
 Hence, each map is depicted in a two-dimensional position, that is, the length, width, and not the height or depth of the object
 udhaahranswaroop, saadharantaya dharaatal par sthit parvat, makaan yaa ped paudhon kii oonchaai maanchitr par nahin dekh pate or na hi samudron aadi kii gaharaai hi dekh pate hai, lekin samprati bhu-akruti kaa trivim praaroop pradarshit karne ke liye block chitra tathaa ucchavach model aadi atyadhik safalataa ke saath nirmit kiye ja rahe hai
 The word 'map' in Hindi is a composite form of two words 'mana' and 'chitra', giving a clear sense of drawing a picture according to value or measure
 is prakaar yah angreji ke map shabd kii apeksha jo swayan latin bhashaa ke maipa shabd se bana he, adhik vaigyanik evam arthbodhak he
 The words chart and plan are used along with the map
 chart shabd french bhashaa ke cart shabd se bana he pehle bahudhaa chart evam maanchitr shabdon kaa upyog ek duusare ke arth main hua karata tha, parantu ab 'chart' kaa upyog mahasagariya yaa vayumandaleey margon athwa jal yaa hawa kii tarangon evam unke margo ko ankit karne ke liye haata he
 Routes of ships on the sea and airplanes in the atmosphere are displayed on the chart
 maanchitr or plan main bhi vyaavhaarik antar ho gaya he
 a plan is usually called a picture prepared by precisely measuring a relatively small part for a particular purpose
 udhaahranswaroop, bhawan-nirmaan-kala-visheshgy dwaara bhawan kaa plan taiyaar kiya jaataa he, jisamen uski bahari seemaa hi nahin andar ke kamaron, daravaajon, khidakiyon aadi ke sthanvishesh bhi ankit rahete hai
 Plans are prepared on a much larger scale than maps
 maanchitr anek prakaar ke hote hai or anek prakaar se upyogi hai
 The map per unit location is more factual and inclusive than any other type of character or plot
 hajaaron shabdon main bhi jis tathy kaa thik thik varnan kar gyaan nahin kara sakate, uskaa gyaan vaigyanik dhang se taiyaar kiya gaya ek chota maanchitr suvidha se kara saktaa he
 That is why nowadays, maps and parallelograms, pictures, etc
 are being used more and more for the understanding of all kinds of knowledge related to the situation
 bhugol tathaa maanchitr main dhanishth sambandh he
 Both the study and teaching of geography seems incomplete and impossible without a map
 maanchitr dwaara vibhinn tathyon kii sthiti, vistaar athwa vitaran evam parsparik sthitik sambandhon kaa samuchit evam sahaj gyaan ho jaataa he
 For example, even if we have knowledge of the total population of the country or its various administrative departments, that knowledge will not give us a sense of the actual distribution of the population, but putting the same knowledge on the map will not only give a direct regional or local distribution of the distribution
 Clear knowledge of various dimensions of population becomes easy
 at: maanchitr ke dwaara prithvi kii vastusthitiyon kaa jitna gyaan vihangam drushtimaatr se hi ho jaataa he utana pustakeey athwa kisi anya saadhan dwaara sambhav nahin he
 In geography, there is a special study of the distribution of matter, so the map is given more and more importance
 sainik vigyaan main bhi maanchitr ko samuchit mahatv diya jaataa he
 Maps have also proved to be very useful in administrative tasks and schemes
 raashtra yaa rajyon athwa vibhinn prashasnic vibhaagon tathaa upavibhaagon ke simanirdhaaran ke liye hi nahin, pratyut prayek khand ke vibhinn prakritik tathaa maanviya sansadhano ke vitaran ke maanchitr bhi sucharu prashasan ke liye aavashyak he
 Knowledge of distribution of various human and natural resources is also necessary for planning related works, on the basis of which plans can be made for economic improvement balanced and scientifically and regionally or regionally
 iske atirikt vibhinn prakritik avyavon ke parsparik paristhitik sambandhon evam nirbharta ke bodh ke liye maanchitr sarvshereshth saadhan he
 For example, the relationship of different components of climate, temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc
 to soil, botanical and biological types can be revealed by the map and the relation of that compiled picture can be established with the distribution of population
 sainya sanchaalan, paryaton, yatayaat, vyapaar, vyavsaay aadi, sabhi kshetron main maanchitr kaa mahatv adhik he
 In the second half of the 20th century, when humans were successfully conscious of establishing their power at the bottom of the oceans and the planetary satellites of space, the need to map maps of other planetary satellites, not only that of Earth, has increased
 maanchitr bhootal par sthit kisi vaastavik tathy ko nahin pradarshit karte, keval chihnvishesh dwaara kaagaj yaa anya tal par prithvi ke sangat bindu kii sthiti dikhaate hai
 Lack of knowledge of this truth creates confusion
 maanchitr samtal hote hai, parantu prithvi yaa anya grah upgrah, yaa uskaa koi bhaag, golak arthath gole kaa bhaag hota he, par golak ko samtal par thik thik nahin prakat kiya ja saktaa, at: is cheshtaa main maanchitr ke vibhinn bhaagon main akruti kii vikruti hoti he
 By interpolation, a map of latitude and longitude lines is prepared and a map is prepared
 at: maanchitr ke pathan ke liye prithvi ke vibhinn bhaagon kii maanchitr par utaari hui saapekshik sthiti, disha, duuri tathaa vistaar aadi kaa gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Two things are necessary regarding the map: maanchitr kaa pathan, arthath prithvi ke vishay main maanchitr par ankit tathyon kaa gyaan praapt karnaa, tathaa The creation of a map, which involves learning the methods of map preparation and acquiring knowledge of statistics, scales, interpolation, practical and symbolic symbols, colors, etc
 maanchitr anek prakaar ke hote he or unhen ham kai prakaar se vargeekrut kar sakate hai : 1
 Simple Map 2
 vishisht vishyatmak maanchitr
 a simple map includes all the common natural and cultural conditions of the map area, such as mountains, rivers, administrative departments, cities, means of transportation, etc
 vishisht vishyatmak maanchitron main uddeshy vishesh se kuch nishchit prakaar ke tathyon kaa samavesh rahata he, jaise jansankhya kaa vitaran maanchitr yaa fasalon ke vitaran kaa maanchitr
 Display of many or all facts on the same map is impossible, on the other it leads to misconceptions about the distribution, expansion or relative importance of different facts, etc
, hence the same scale for knowledge of regional relativity of different facts
 Comparative study of different toxicological maps can be done easily
 udhaahranswaroop, kisi kshetra ke ek hi paimaane par, alag alag taiyaar kiye gaye, varsha, taap, mitti, vanaspati, fasalon tathaa jansankhya ke vitaran maanchitron kaa sahaj hi tulanaatmak drushti se adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 The maps can be classified in terms of scale and purpose
 k
 bhookar yaa patawaari maanchitr - aise maanchitr main bhumiswatv, krishi kshetron, bhawan tathaa anya bhoomisampatti kaa savistaar samavesh rahata he
 This facilitates the administration to collect personal land tax, income tax, building tax etc
 hamaaren gaavon ke maanchitr praaia: 16 inch, parantu kabhi kabhi 32 inch tathaa 64 inch, prati mile ke paimaane par bane rahete hai
 B
 Geomorphic Map - These maps are prepared by surveying properly using pure survey methods
 bharat ke surveykshan vibhaag ke maanchitr isi prakaar ke hote hai
 In these, important natural facts on the ground, such as mountains, plateaus, reliefs, rivers, vegetation etc
 and cultural, ie, human-made objects, such as buildings, villages, cities, means of transportation, etc
 are displayed
 saadharantaya inkaa paimaana ek inch baraabar ek mile ke rup main hota he, kintu 1 / 2 inch yaa 1 / 4 inch baraabar ek mile ke bhi maanchitr hote hai
 The scale of foreign maps also varies
 adhikansh europea deshon ke bhu-akruti maanchitron ke paimaanon ke dyotak bhinn 1:25,000 yaa 1:1,00,000 yaa inke gunak ke rup main hote hai
 In the United States, there are landform maps on fractions indicating 1: 62,500 or 1: 1,25,000
 metric pranali ke apnaane se bharat ke surveykshan maanchitr bhi 1:50,000 dyotak bhinn ke paimaane par parivartit kiye ja rahe hai
 Maps of 1: 10,00,000 are also similar, which are called international maps
 ga
 deewari maanchitr - bhu-akruti maanchitron kii apeksha inkaa paimaana chota hota he
 There are also articles of major natural and man-made constructions and hence they are mostly used for teaching studies in classrooms
 gha
 atlas maanchitrawali - ye maanchitr apekshaakrit bahut chote paimaane par taiyaar kiye jate hai or deewari maanchitron kii tarah hi inamen vibhinn prakritik tathaa maanav dwaara nirmit nirmaanon kaa samavesh rahata he
 Due to the small scale, often major administrative blocks and departments have also prepared and are doing national or regional atlas
 bharat main bhi kendriya sarkaar ne ek mahati rashtriya atlas yojana banaai he, jiskaa centre kalakatta he or jo bhugolavidon ke prabandh main safaltaapurvak chal rahi he
 There are many types of maps according to purpose and fact as well
 aise maanchitron main jis tathyavishesh kaa samavesh rahata he, usee ke anusaar unka namakaran hota he; udhaahranswaroop, grah upgrahon evam antariksh kii sthiti pradarshak maanchitr, 'jyotish maanchitr' kehalaata he, kintu jab kai tathy pradarshit kiye jate hai or unamem vishyatmak sambhddhata rahati he, to mul vishay par namakaran hota he; udhaahranswaroop, jab kisi manchitr main taap, hawa, jal yaa himavrishti yaa mausam sambandhi tatv saath saath samavisht rahete hai, to use ritudarshak maanchitr kehete he
 Some of the major factual maps are: 1
 jyotish maanchitr; 2
 Elongation map; 3
 bhuvaigyanik maanchitr : isamen bhugarbhik-sthitiyon, chattaanon, khanij padaarthon tathaa mitti aadi evam unka vistaar aadi kaa samavesh rahata he; 4
 Depth measurement map of the sea: In these, the depth of the sea level of the oceans, oceans or large lakes etc
 and their height are shown below; 5
 samudr evam parvatiy ucchavachan maanchitr : inamen samudron, mahasaagaron yaa jhiilon kii gaharaai tathaa parvatiy unchaai nichaai kaa pradarshan rahata he; 6
 Weather or weather indicator map; 7
 jalwaayu maanchitr -- inamen adhik kalavadhi ke ritu prakarnon kii ausat dashaon kaa vitaran dikhalaayaa jaataa he; 8
 Botanical and zoological map - In this, the distribution of different types of vegetation, animals and humans etc
 is shown; 9
 raajnneetik maanchitr : inamen kisi raashtra ke vibhinn stareey prashasnic khandon, upkhandon tathaa unke vibhaagon, upavibhaagon, simaaon, prashasnic kendron aadi kaa samavesh rahata he ; 10
 Population Map: In these, the distribution of population is shown by various methods
 The distribution map of human by species is called the human race map; 11
 aarthik maanchitr -- inamen mukhyat: van saadhan, krishi kii fasalon, khanij tathaa audyagik vastuon kaa vitaran dikhalaayaa jaataa he maanchitr bhi kehete hai
 Business maps, showing objects of commercial importance, and aids in trade, such as traffic
 vitaran dikhalaanevaale maanchitron ko vitaran maanchitr kehete hai; 12
 Historical and archaeological map - These include marking of ancient villages and cities, boundaries of ancient states and empires, battlefields, invasions or defense and travel routes etc
 13
 sainik maanchitr -- inamen sainik mahatv ke tathyon kaa ankan hota he
 Words in a map contain at least a point or article of fact and use a variety of methods in their place
 un vividh vidhiyon tathaa chihnon ko samuhik rup se maanchitr kii bhashaa kii sangya de sakate hai
 The following are the major elements of this language: maanchitr main prithvi yaa uske khand ko chote rup main pradarshit karte hai
 Therefore, the proportional relationship between the Earth and the map is represented by the scale
 paimaane do prakaar ke hote hai : deergh tathaa laghu
 The distance between two points in the longer scale will be relatively longer
 at: deergh paimaane kaa maanchitr laghu paimaane ke maanchitr ke apeksha kam kshetra gherega, kintu usamen adhik tathyon kaa samavesh spashttar dhang se hoga
 In small scale, the distance of two points will be near and relatively few or major facts are only possible in such maps
 paimaane kaa chunaav nimnlikhit baton par nirbhar karata he : maanchitrit kshetra kaa kul kshetrafal, kaagaj kaa vistaar, ankit kiye janevaale tathyon kii sankhya evam maanchitr kaa prayojan
 The scale must be marked on each map
 paimaane teen vidhiyon se pradarshit kiye jate hai, kintu sabhi vidhiyaan prayek maanchitr par nahin dikhalaai jaati : a
 saadhaaran vivaran dwaara yaa likhakar, jaise 4 inch = 1 mile; ba
