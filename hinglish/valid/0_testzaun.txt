 Gita gave a new definition to sannyas by accepting spirituality
 "sanyas" kaa saamaanya arth "tyaag" he
 But there is often confusion in this sacrifice
 bhojan, shayan aadi prakritik karmon kaa tyaag kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also possible to renounce working deeds
 yahi gita kaa sanyas he
 It is possible to renounce the desire for fruit
 yahi gita kaa sanyas he
 Desiring to bear fruit, performing lustful deeds for public gathering is the ideal of life
 yahi moksh kaa saadhan he
 This Nishkam Karmayoga of the Gita has been adopted by most Indian philosophies
 gyanayog uskaa aadhyatmik aadhaar he or bhaktiyog uskaa bhavatmak darshan he
 Shankaracharya's Advaitamat is the oldest of these many sects of Vedanta
 yah sambhavat: sabase adhik pratishthit bhi he
 The monotheism of Shankaracharya depends on the Upanishads
 unke anusaar brahm hi ek maatr satya he
 The world deflects and enlivens the spirit of the living being
 agyaan kaa nivaaran hone par jeev ko apane brahmbhav kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is salvation
 brahm sachchidanand he
 Brahma's power and consciousness and his bliss are endless
 jaagrit, swapn or sushupt kii avasthaaon se pare tathaa bahya or aantarik vishyon se ateet anubhav main brahm kaa prakaash hota he
 Brahma is indescribable due to being transcendental
 sankhyathit hone ke kaaran use "advait" kaha jaataa he
 This monotheism is differentiated in practices of renunciation and love
 samadhi main iskaa aantarik saakshaatkaar hota he
 Brahma has been considered as the cause of the world to prove the advaita bhava
 brahm ko jagat kaa upadan kaaran maanakar donon kaa advait siddh ho jaataa he
 The apprehension of the outcome of the factor has been overcome by discourse
 vivartkaaran avikarya hota he
 Its function is false, like the snake's illusion in the rope
 rajju sarp or swapn praatibhasik satya hai
 The world is the practical truth
 moksh paryant vah maanya he
 Brahma is the ultimate truth which remains in salvation
 maaya se yukt brahm "ishwar" kehalaata he
 He is the creator of the universe, but it is not the ultimate truth
 brahmanubhav kaa saadhan gyaan he
 Acts are not eternal
 "brahm" karm ke dwaara saadhy nahin he
 Karma and devotion are the cooperative causes of salvation
 shravan, manan or nididhyasana mokshasadhana ke teen charan hai
 In salvation, the soul is freed from all shackles and is overwhelmed with eternal bliss
 yah moksh jeevankaal main prapya he tathaa jivan ke vyavhaar se isaki purna sangati he
 About 300 years after Shankaracharya, in the 11th century, Ramanujacharya established the Vishishtadvaita school based on the new interpretation of the Brahmasutras
 ramanujakrit "shribhashya" ke aadhaar par yah 'srisampradaay' kehalaata he
 Ramanuja does not believe in Shankar's Mayanism
 unke anusaar jeev, jagat or brahm teenon parmaarthik satya hai
 Jagat is not the inversion of Brahma but is the actual creation of Brahma
 brahm or ishwar ek duusare ke paryaay hai
 Jiva is part of Brahman
 moksh main jagat kaa vilay nahin hota or jeev kaa swatantra astitv bana rahata he
 Brahma is not unique and non-virtuous, but characteristic and virtuous
 brahm hi swatantra satta he
 Jeeva and Jagat are adjective adjectives
 brahm se pruthak unka astitv sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, Ramanuja's opinion is also Advaita
 jeev or jagat ke visheshnon se yukt brahm kaa inke sath vishisht advaitabhaav he
 Brahma is his inter-lord
 ramanuj ke mat main bhakthi moksh kaa mukhya saadhan he
 Knowledge of the qualities of God is the motivator of devotion
 saadhaaran jan or shudron ke liye prapatti arthath sharnagati sarvottam maarg hai
 a few years after Ramanuja, Nimbarkacharya established Dvaitadvaitaism in the 11th century itself
 brahmasutron par "vedant-parijaat-saurabh" naam se unka bhashya is mat kaa aadhaar he
 Like Ramanuja, Nimbark also considers Jiva and Jagat as truth and dependent of Brahma
 ramanuj ke mat main advait pradhan he
 The request for duality is greater in the Nimbark vote
 ramanuj ke anusaar jeev or brahm main swarupagat samya he, unki shakti main bhed hai
 There is a characteristic distinction between them in the opinion of Nimbark
 nimbark ke advait kaa aadhaar jeev kii brahm par nirbharta he
 The Brahm of Nimbark is a virtuous god
 krishna ke rup main uski bhakthi hi moksh kaa param maarg he
 This devotion comes from the grace of God
 bhakthi se bhagwaan kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is salvation
 ramanuj or nimbark dono ke mat main videh mukti hi maanya he
 After Nimbarka, in the 13th century Madhvacharya propounded the dualism
 ve purnaprajna tathaa aanandathirth ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He has established dualism by refuting the Advaita of Shankaracharya and the dualism of Nimbarka
 unke anusaar bhed or abhed donon kii ekatra sthati sambhav nahin he
 Shankaracharya's Mayaism is also not acceptable to him
 jagat mithyaa nahin yatharth he
 It is not possible for the third indefinite category of Maya to be different from Sat and Asat
 ishwar, jeev or jagat teenon ek duusare se bhinn hai
 There are five types of distinction
 ishwarjiv, ishwar-jagat, jeev-jagat, jeev-jeev or jad padaarthon main paraspar bhed he
 God is the cause of the world, not the cause of the world
 upadan karan prakruti he
 God is its regulator
 ishwar kii bhakthi ke dwaara moksh praapt hota he
 There is a difference between free organisms
 ve ishwar se bhinn rahakar apni samathrya ke anusaar ishwar kii vibhuti main bhaag lete hai
 In the 15th century Vallabhacharya propagated the Shuddhadvaita faith
 is mat kaa aadhaar "brahmasutron" par likhit vallabhacharya kaa "anubhashya" he
 He considers the Advaita bhava of pure Brahma indulged with Maya
 yah brahm nirgun nahin, sagun he tathaa maaya ke sambandh se rahit he
 Brahma expresses as a universe with its infinite power
 chit or anand kaa tirodhan hone ke kaaran jagat main keval sat rup se brahm kii abhivyakti hoti he
 Jeeva and Brahma are one in nature
 agni ke sfurligon kii bhaanti jeev brahm kaa ansh he, visheshan nahin
 Thus everywhere is advaita, nowhere is dvaita
 maryaada or pushti do prakaar kii bhakthi moksh kaa saadhan hai
 In the 16th century, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu introduced Achintya piercing
 unke shishy rup goswami ne gaudi vaishnav sampradaay kaa pratishthapan kiya
 According to them, the power of God is untouchable
 vah virdohi gunon kaa samanvay kar sakati he
 The practice of salvation is the religion of life, not contemplating impunity
 moksh kaa arth bhagwaan kii priti kaa nirantar anubhav he
 Thus in the later period of the Vedic era, the new rise of Vedanta in the Upanishads took place in the form of Advaita, Vishayadvaita, Dvaita, Shuddhavaita etc
 from 7th century to 16th century
 upanishdon kaa vedant pashchimi or uttari bharat kii dein he
 Advaita etc
 cults emerged from the south
 inke pravartak dakshin deshon ke nivasee the
 Chaitanya's idea originated from Bengal
 kintu in sabhi sampradaayon ne vrudanvan aadi uttari sthanon main apane peeth banaae
 Shankaracharya installed benches at all four corners of the country
 uttar, dakshin, purv, pashchim sabhi pradeshon ke log in sampradaayon main sammilit hue
 Despite being different in principle, these various sects of Vedanta became the sources of internal unity of India
 pashupat dekhen In addition to Vedic and non-vedic philosophies, a third stream in the Indian philosophical tradition has flowed to Shaivism and Shakta sects
 kuch rahasyamay sadhana ke rup main hone ke kaaran yah vaidic or avaidic dhaaraon ke sangam main kuch saraswati ke samaan gupt rahi he
 But Shiva also has a lot of recognition as a direct worship
 pracheen aitihaasik khojon se shiv kii pracheenta pramanit hoti he
 The village has Shiva temples in the village
 prati saptaah or prati paksh main shiv kaa vrath hota he
 The divine marriage of Mahadev Parvati is worshiped as an ideal in Indian families
 rugveda or yajurveda ke rudra ke rup main shiv kaa varnan he
 But Shiva is often considered as the non-vedic god
 daksh ke yajyagwans ke prasang ke dwaara shiv kii avaidikata kaa samarthan kiya jaataa he puranic yug main bhi tridevon kii tulana ke prasang main virodh ke abhas milte hai
 But later Shiva became a very popular deity
 shaiva sampradaay praaia: gupt tantron ke rup main rahe hai
 Very little of his literature is published
 prakashit sahitya bhi pratikatmak hone ke kaaran duruh he
 There are many sects of Shaivite tradition
 inamen shaiva, pashupat, virshaiv, kalamukh, kapalik, kashmir shaiva mat tathaa dakshini mat adhik prasiddh hai
 These can be called conspiracies of Shaivite tradition
 shaiva siddhaat kaa prachaar dakshin main tamil desh main he
 Its basis is in the Agam texts
 14veen shatabdi main nilkanth ne "brahmasutron" par shaivabhashya kii rachana kar vedant parampara ke saath shivamat kaa samanvay kiya
 Pashupat Mat is famous as 'nakulish Pashupat'
 pashupat sutara is sampradaay kaa mul granth he
 The Kalamukh and Kapalic sects have been somewhat fierce and mysterious
 kashmir shaiva mat advait vedant ke samaan he
 Despite being a tantric, his philosophical literature is immense
 isaki spand or pratybhigna do shakhaayen hai
 One has the basis of Vasantagupta's vibrancy and the other is based on his disciple Somananda's "pratibhagyastika"
 jeev or parameshwar kaa advait donon shakhaon main maanya he
 Parameshwara "shiva" is similar to Vedanta's Brahman
 virshaiv mat dakshin deshon se prachlit he
 His followers wear Shivling
 at: inhen "lingayat" bhi kehete hai
 In the 12th century Vasava propagated this view
 virshaiv mat ek prakaar kaa vishishtadvait he
 It can be called Shakti Vishishtvaita because of considering Shakti specific world as the ultimate element
 uttar or dakshin main prachlit shaiva sampradaay bhi uttar vedant sampradaayon kii bhanti bharat kii dharmik ekta ke sutara hai
 Shiva worshiped from Kailas to Rameshwaram is the Mars god of Indian unity
 donon kii yatraaon ke dwaara bhartiya ekta kaa vyaavhaarik anushthan hota he
 The source of Shaktipuja is probably in the Matritantra of ancient India

 The word "devi" is often used in the women's names as an answer
 shakti ke anek rup hai
 Goddess is worshiped in the form of Lakshmi, Saraswati, Parvati, Kali etc
 "shakti" icchaaroop he
 In Sivasutra, willpower is given the form of Uma Kumari
 par tatv ke chinmay rup main ichhashakti kaa samanvay shakti darshan kaa ek mahatvapurn paksh he
 Reference error: Tags exist for the reference group named "N", but no tag was found for the group

 iske baad use 'jahansos' ke naam se janaa jane laga, jiskaa matlab 'jahaan / vishwa main aag lagane vaala' hota he
 With this, the Ghaznavi empire began to end

 mandavy rishi ne dharmraj ko shraap de diya tha isi kaaran ve sau varsh paryant shudra ban kar rahe
 At one time, some thieves were caught by the messengers of a king at the ashram of Mandavya Hashi
 duuton ne choron ke saath mandavy rishi ko bhi chor samaj kar pakad liya
 The king commanded the thieves to put them on the cross
 un choron ke saath mandath rishi ko bhi shuli par chadha diya gaya kintu is baat kaa pataa lagate hi ki chor nahin hai balki rishi hai, raja ne unhen shuli se utarava kar apane aparaadh ke liye kshamaa maangi
 Mandavya Rishi reached at Dharmaraja's question and asked that why did you make me go on the cross on account of my sin? Dharmaraja said that in his childhood, he had pierced a grasshopper with a tip, you got this punishment in this sin
 rishi bole - "vah kaary maine agyaanavash kiya tha or tumne agyaanavash kiye gayi kaary kaa itnaa kathor dand dekar aparaadh kiya he

 The Inter Cayetra of 1456, however, was a direct violation of the bull Sikut Dudum, formerly issued in 1435 by Pope Eugene IV, in which he clarified that the Kafiro was also born in the image of God and that he too had a soul, concluding it Was that no Christian follower has the right to take away their freedom

 Cheating, deceit, dishonesty, deception, nervousness and tricks are ways of convincing the truth that they are not true or not completely true
 dhokhe main dhong, prachaar or haath kii safai shaamil ho sakati he
 Distraction, deception or concealment can also be used for this
 aise main swayan ko dhokhaa bhi ho saktaa he
 Cheating is a major relational violation, often leading to feelings of betrayal and mistrust in the partners concerned
 dhokhaa sambandhparak niyamon kaa ulanghan karata he or ise ummiido kaa nakaaratmak ulanghan mana jaataa he
 Most people expect friends, concerned partners and even strangers to always be truthful

 On any given day, of course most people either cheat someone or cheat on someone

 Deception involves various forms of communication or omissions that spoil the whole truth or try to hide it
 dhokhaa apane aap main maukhik / yaa ankahe sandesh ko jaanboojhkar is tarah se prabandhit kiye jane kaa tarika he jiske bare main preshak jaanata he ki sandesh paane vaala use sach maan legaa jo ki jhooth he
 Intention is critical in the context of deception

 The mutual deception theory detects deception between mutual relations
 sanchaar vishay ke jariye bhraamak aadan-pradaan ke dauraan preshak evam abhigrahi ke gyaan or vyavhaar kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 There are five primary types of deception: kareebi rishton main dhokhebaazi kii teen mukhya manshaaen ho sakati hai
 It is very difficult to detect deception among the concerned peers unless one partner tells a blatant lie or confuses things with a blatant lie that the other partner knows the truth
 Although it is difficult to cheat on a partner for long periods of time, everyday interactions in related couples only raise suspicion
 dhokhe kaa pataa lagaana mushkil he kyonki dhokhe kaa pataa lagane ke liye koi vishwasaneey sanketak nahin hai
 However, cheaters often have significant cognitive burden
 purush yaa stri vishesh ko pichley bayanon ko yaad rakhana chahie taaki uski kahani lagaataar vishwasaneey bani rahe
 parinamswarup, dhokheybaaj aksar shabdic or ashabdic taur par mahatvapurn jaankariyaan de dete hai
 Deception detection is very complex, based on the cognitive process in the context of the exchange of messages
 antarvaiyaktik dhokhe ke siddhant kaa maananaa he ki antarvaiyaktik dhokhaa ek preshak, jo sach se alag karne ke liye jaankaree main herpher karata he or ek abhigrahi, jo sandesh kii vaidhata sthapit karne kaa prayaas karata he, ke bich chalane vaali parsparik prabhaav kii ek gatisheel, punraritiya prakriya he
 The actions of a fraudster are interrelated with the actions of the receiver of the message

 Noted deception scholar Aldert Vrij has also stated that there is no nonverbal behavior that is specifically associated with deception
 jaisaa ki pehle kaha gaya he, dhokhe kaa koi vishisht vyavhaar suchak maujuud nahin he
 However, there are some nonverbal behaviors that have been found to be correlated with deception
 vrij ne paaya ki ek akele sanket ke jaanch kii apeksha in sanketon ke ek samooh kaa pareekshan dhokhe kaa adhik vishwasaneey suchak tha
 In terms of perceptions about the importance of cheating on a partner, women's and men's beliefs about deception are generally quite different from each other
 purushon kii tulana main mahilaayein dhokhe ko ek bahut adhik gambheer sambandhparak aparaadh ke rup main dekhati hai
 Additionally, women generally rate lying as a less acceptable behavior than men
 antat mahilayen jhooth bolne ke kisi bhi kaary ko bahut adhik mahatvapurn maanati hai or jhooth ke prati adhik nakaaratmak bhavuk pratikriyaayein darshaati hai
 The bias of truth significantly distorts the respective pairs' ability to detect deception
 dhokhe ke sandarbh main, sach kaa purvaagrah adhik sandeshon ko, unki vaastavik satyata se pare, jhooth kii apeksha sach maanane kii pravriti darshata he
 When identifying the truth of the message, the bias of the truth contributes to an over-estimation of the actual number of truths associated with the base rate of a true truth
 sach kaa purvaagrah kareebi rishton main vishesh rup se majboot hota he
 People are willing to rely highly on the communication of others and do not want to question their partner until they are confronted with a significant deviation of behavior that is due to reassessment
 kisi parichit vyakti yaa sabandhit saathi se mili dhokhe kaa pataa lagaate samay saathi ke bare main gyaat jaankaree kii ek badi maatra ko dhyaan main rakhkar aisa prayaas kiya jaataa he yah jaankaree anivaary rup se abhigraahak ke dhokhe kaa pataa lagane kii sangyanatmak or dhokhe ke kisi sanket ko pahchaanane kii kshamta ko dabaa detii he
 Deception in strangers is easier to detect, because less information about that person is brought to mind

 In this, camouflage is usually painted with such colors as the background from which the object can be hidden
 Camouflage is proven by 'hiding' certain truths in the case of deceiving half-truths
 udhaaharan: Disguise is the kind of appearance that is done to create the impression of being someone or something else, for a celebrity to do so is also called disguise or disguise
 udhaaharan: In a more pithy sense, the term 'disguise' can be used to disguise the nature of a particular offer to hide an unpopular motivation or effect associated with that proposition

 For example, in World War II it was common to use hollow tanks made of cardboard to fool the Allied reconnaissance aircraft by the Allies, giving them the illusion of a large artillery unit moving in one area
 Whereas real tanks were well hidden elsewhere and "dummy" tanks were active elsewhere

 Some work systems of social research, particularly psychology, involve cheating
 shodhakarta prayog kii sahi prakruti ke bare main pratibhaagiyon ko jaanboojh kar gumraah karte yaa galat jaankaree dete hai
 In an experiment conducted by Stanley Milgram in 1963, researchers told participants that they would participate in a scientific study of memory and practice
 In reality, the study was paying attention to the participants' willingness to obey orders, even when one person was hurting another
 dhokhe kaa prayog anusandhan naitikta main kai samasyaayein uthaata he or ise america psychological association jaise peshewar nikaayon dwaara sakhti se viniyamit kiya jaataa he
 Psychological research often needs to deceive participants as to its real purpose
 is tarah ke dhokhe ke liye tark yah he ki manushya is baat ke prati samvedansheel hote hai ki ve dusron ke saamne kaise prakat hote hai or yah aatm-chetana isamen hastkshep kar sakati he yaa ise bigaad sakati he ki ve ek shodh ke sandarbh ke baahar vastav main kaise vyavhaar karte hai 
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar ek manovaigyanik un paristhitiyon ko jaanane kaa icchhuk he, jiske tahat chaatr parikshaon main nakal karte hai to sidhe yah poochna,""aap kitni baar nakal karte hai?" to parinaam "saamaajik drushti se vaanchhneeya" uttaron kaa ek ucch pratishat ho saktaa he or anusandhankarta kisi bhi haalat main in pratikriyaaon kii sateekta ko satyapit karne main asamarth ho saktaa he
 This process of "asking the subject" to researchers reveals what students "say" they do, but not necessarily what they actually do
 saamaanya taur par, tab, jab yah bas sidhe logon se yah poochna ki ve jo karte hai, vah kyon yaa kitni baar karte hai avyaavhaarik yaa saral ho to shodhakarta apane pratibhaagiyon ko unki ruchi ke vaastavik vyavhaar se vichlit karne ke liye dhokhe kaa upyog karne kii ore mud jate hai
 So, for example, in a mock study, participants are told that the study is to learn how intuitive they are and that during this process they have the opportunity to see another participant's answer before handing them their answer
 can be given
 dhokhe se sambandhit is yaa kisi or anusandhan ke samaapan par, sabhi pratibhaagiyon ko adhyayan ke sachche swaroop ke bare main bataaya janaa chahie or yah ki kyon dhokhaa aavashyak tha 
 iske alaava, anusandhan ke samaapan par sabhi pratibhaagiyon ko parinaamon kaa ek saransh pradaan karnaa prathagat he
 Although commonly used, according to the American Psychological Association apa
org guidelines and with their permission, there is a debate about whether it is ethical to use deception in psychological research
 jo log dhokhe ke khilaaf hai ve iske istemaal main shaamil naitik or karypranali sambandhi muddon par aapatti uthaate hai
 Dresser noted that researchers can, ethically, use a person in an experiment only if the speaker has given informed consent about the subject
 However, due to its nature, the researcher experimenting on deception cannot reveal his or her true purpose on the subject, so the participant who has given consent is given incorrect information
 
 bomarind, ne milgram ke aagyaakaarita prayog kii aalochana karte hue tark diya ki dhokhe par yojit prayog anupyukt tareeke se pratibhaagi dwaara diye gayi vishwaas or aagyaakaarita kaa phayda uthaata he jabaki pratibhaagi ne khud bhaag lene par hami bhar di he

 Ortmann and Hurtwig posited that "cheating can drastically affect individual laboratories and the reputation of the profession, thus contaminating the participant stepwell" p
 806)
 If the participant involved in the experiment is suspicious of the researcher, then they will not do the way they normally would and the possibility of control over the experiment being conducted by the researcher decreases
 jo log dhokhe ke prayog par aapatti nahin karte hai ve dhyaan rakhen ki "saamaajik samasyaon kaa hal karne ke liye anusandhan kii jarurat or anusandhan main bhagidaar kii garima or adhikaron ke sangrakshan kii jarurat" ke bich santulan banaaye rakhane ke liye nirantar sangharsh jari he, christensen 
 ve iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhen ki kuch maamalon main jaankaree hasil karne kaa ekmaatr upaay dhokhaa hi he auki yah ki anusandhan main dhokhe par pratibandh lagane se "shodhakartaaon ko mahatvapurn adhyayan kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ko karne se rokane par prabal parinaam ho sakate hai"
 Additionally, based on the findings, it is found that deception is not harmful to the participants
 christensen ke sahitya kii samiksha main paaya gaya ki "anusandhan pratibhaagiyon ko yah anubhav nahin hota ki unhen nuksaan pahunchaaya ja rahaa he yaa ve bhramit kiye jane kaa bura maanate hue prathit nahin hote hai" 
 iske alaava, dhokhe se jude prayogon main bhaag lene waalon ke "bare main report he ki ve prayog kaa lutf uthaate hai or unhen isse shaikshanik laabh miltaa he" jabaki gaiyr bhraamak prayogon main shaamil hone waalon ke saath aisa nahin hota he 
 Finally, it has also been suggested that the unpleasant method used in the study of deception or the unpleasant consequences resulting from the use of deception, may have been the underlying cause of deception experiments that unethical its systemic use Believes, when it does not happen by deception itself

 Plato's Allegory of the Kew, presented in Book VII of The Republic, describes a similar journey, as written by Teresa of Avila
 aadhyatmik yatra ek maarg he jiske aayam mukhya rup se vyaktiparak or vyaktigat hai
 a spiritual path can be considered a short-term path specified toward a specific goal, or life-span

 aadhunik greek sahitya ke sarvapradhan ang aise padya, lekh tathaa kavy hai jo sarsaadhaaran main prachlit bhashaa main likhe gaye
 The language that is popularly known as "demotic Greek" as opposed to classical
 inamen adhikansh loakgeet kii shrenee main aate hai or lokajeevan ke utaar chadhaav ke pratibimb hai

 The rebels fought vigorously against the British at Chanda and Amethi

 But Chanda's fight looked like Waterloo for him
 angrejon ke chakke chhot gaye or unako buree tarah parajeet hona padaa
 The British became very nervous due to this defeat

 But the rebel leaders also had 23 guns of various categories in the Battle of Chanda

 This time the rebels were defeated due to the devious policy and intelligence preparations of the British

 Two days before Deepawali, Dhanteras then Narak Chaturdashi or Chhoti Deepawali then Deepawali and Godhan Pooja, Brotherhood
 narak chaturdashi ko choti deepawali bhi kehete hai
 It is called Chhoti Deepawali because one day before Deepawali, the night light is shone away from the light beam as in the night of Diwali, in the same way at night
 is raat die jalaane kii pratha ke sandarbh main kai puranic kathaayen or lokmanyataayen hai
 Another legend regarding the fast and worship of this day is that there was a saintly and devout king named Ranti Dev
 unhone anjaane main bhi koi paap nahin kiya tha lekin jab mrityu kaa samay aayaa to unke saamne yamadut aa khadey hue
 The king was surprised to see Yamdoot in front and said that i have never done any sinful act, then why have you come to pick me up because your coming here means that i have to go to hell
 aap mujh par krupa karen or bataaen ki mere kis aparaadh ke kaaran mujhe narak janaa pad rahaa he
 On hearing the pleasing speech of the holy king, Yamdoot said, "once a hungry Brahmin returned from your door, this is the fruit of the same sin
" duuton kii is prakaar kehane par raja ne yamaduton se kaha ki main aapse vinati karata hum ki mujhe varsh kaa or samay de de
 The Yamdoots gave the king one year of deferment
 raja apni pareshaani lekar rishiyon ke paas pahunchaa or unhen sab vrutant kahkar unase poocha ki kripaya is paap se mukti kaa kya upaay he
 The sage said, Rajan, you fast on the Chaturdashi of the Krishna Paksha of Kartik month and make Brahmins eat food and apologize to them for their crimes
 raja ne vaisaa hi kiya jaisaa rishiyon ne unhen bataaya
 In this way the kings were freed and got a place in the Vishnu lok
 us din se paap or nark se mukti hetu bhuulok main karthik chaturdashi ke din kaa vrath prachlit he
 On this day, it is great to get up before sunrise and apply oil and bathe with water, and put leaves of chirchiri in it
 snaan ke pashchaat vishnu mandir or krishna mandir main bhagwaan kaa darshan karnaa atyant punyadaayak kaha gaya he
 This cuts off sin and leads to beauty
 karthik krishna paksh kii chaturdashi ko uparokt kaarnon se narak chaturdashi, rup chaturdashi or choti deepawali ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 And after this, Deepawali, Godhan Pooja and Bhai Dooj are celebrated respectively
 puranic katha he ki isi din krishna ne ek daitya nirkasur kaa sanhaar kiya tha
 There is a law to wake up before sunrise, deal with bathing, and offer Yamraj to offer three Anjali water

 It ruled Delhi from 1290-1320 AD
 dilli kii muslim sultanate main doosraa shaasha parivaar tha, haalanki kilji qabeela lambey samay se afghanistan main basaa hua tha, lekin apane purvavarti gulam vansh kii tarah yah rajvansh bhi mulat: turkistan kaa tha
 Its three rulers were known for their disloyalty, ruthlessness and authority over the South Indian Hindu states
 khalji vansh ke pehle sultan jilaluddin firoz khalji, gulam vansh ke antim kamazor badshaah kumarsh ke patan ke baad ek kuleen gut ke sahyog se gaddi par baithe
 Jalaludden was much older in age and was considered so unpopular at the time as an Afghan clan that he could not dare to venture into the capital
 unke bhattije june kaan ne dakkan ke hindu rajya par chadhaai karke elichpur or uske khazaane par qabza kar liya or phir 1296 main waapas lautakar unhone apane chachaa kii hatya kar di
 Juna Khan assumed the title of Alauddin Khalji and ruled for 20 years
 unhone ranthambhore, chittod or mandu par qabza kiya or devgiri ke samrudh hindu rajya ko apane rajya main mila liya
 He also gave a befitting reply to the Mongol invasion
 allaudin ke senapati malik kafoor ko 1308 main dakshin par qabza kar liya, krishna nadi ke dakshin main hoysal vansh ko ukhaad phenkaa or sudur dakshin main madurai par adhikaar kar liya
 When Malik Kafur returned to Delhi in 1311, he was laden with loot
 iske baad allaudin or vansh kaa sitara dub gaya
 The Sultan died in early 1316

 baad main tughlak vansh ke pratham shaasha gayasuddin tululaq ne khusro kaan se gaddi chhen lee
 Who was Khilji? There is substantial controversy in this subject
 itihaaskaar 'nizamuddin ahamed' ne kilji ko changez khaan kaa damaad or kuleen khaan kaa vanshaj, 'barani' ne use turkon se alag evam 'fakhruddin' ne khilgiyon ko turkon kii 64 jatiyon main se ek bataaya he
 Fakhruddin's view has been supported by most scholars
 chunki bharat aane se purv hi yah jati afghanistan ke helemand nadi ke tateey kshetron ke un bhaagon main rahati thi, jise kilji ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Probably that is why this caste was called Khilji
 maamluk athwa ghulaam vansh ke antim sultan shamsuddin kumors kii hatya ke baad hi jilaluddin firoj kilji singhaasana par baitha tha, isliye itihaas main kilji vansh kii sthapana ko kilji kranti ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The Khilji revolution is not only important because it ended the Ghulam dynasty and established the new Khilji dynasty, but it is also important that the Khilji revolution resulted in the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate to the south
 jatvaad main kami ai or saath hi yah dharna bhi khatm hui ki, shashan keval vishishti varg kaa vyakti hi kar saktaa he
 Khilji belonged mainly to the proletariat
 kilji yug samrajyavad or muslim shakti ke vistaar kaa yug tha
 After this revolution the sphere of influence of the Turkish wealthy chieftains decreased
 is kranti ne prashasan main dharm va ulema ke mahatva ko bhi asweekaar kar diya
 Thus the power of the Khilji rulers depended mainly on power
 khilgiyon ne yah siddh kar diya ki, rajya bina dharm kii sahaayta se na keval jivit rakhaa ja saktaa he, balki safaltaapurvak chalaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Jalaluddin Khilji's handling of the throne marks the end of the Mamluk dynasty and the domination of the Ottoman slave elite
 kilji vansh ko saamanyat: turkon kaa ek kabila mana jaataa he, jo uttari bharat par musalamaanon kii vijay ke baad yahan aakar bas gaya
 Jalaluddin Khilji established the Khilji dynasty
 jilaluddin kilji ne ghulaam vansh ke antim sultan kii hatya karke khilgiyon ko dilli kaa sultan banaaya
 The Khilji dynasty ruled from 1290 to 1320 AD
 dilli ke kilji sultaanon main allaudin kilji sabase prasiddh or yogya shaasha tha
 There were three rulers in total - allaudin khilji ne apane samrajya ko dakshin kii disha main badhaayaa
 His empire had failed to the south of the Kaveri River

 These were developed around 1900 AD by German mathematicians c Runga and MW Kuta
 yah ek vidhi nahin balki isamen kai vidhiyaan hai
 It is also called the 'classical runga-kuta Method' or often "RK4"
 yah chaar order vaali vidhi he
 Suppose a simple differential equation is the following: yah vidhi nimnlikhit sutara se samajhi ja sakati he: n = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,
 
 
, And h kaa uchit dhanatmak maan lekar is vidhi ko barbar prayog karke t ke kisi bhi maan ke liye y kaa sannikat maan nikaal sakate hai
 Let dxdt = - tx { \ displaystyle { \ frac {dx} {dt}} = { \ frac {-t} {x}}} be solved
 diya hua he ki t = 0 x = 1 { \ displaystyle t=0 \ , \ , \ ,x=1} The exact solution of this differential equation is t 2 + x 2 = 1 { \ displaystyle t ^ {2} + x ^ {2} = 1}
 ham h = 0, 1 { \ displaystyle h=0,1} lekar iskaa hal nikaalte hai
 This gives x = 0, 994987426585 { \ displaystyle x = 0,994987426585} at t = 0, 1 { \ displaystyle t = 0,1}
 isi tarah ham t ke vibhinn maanon ke liye x kaa maan praapt karte jate hai, jo nimnaankit sarini main dikhaaye gayi hai- Note that a pure solution to this differential equation will yield x = 0 { \ displaystyle x = 0} at t = 1 { \ displaystyle t = 1}, while x = 0
0488018582123 { \ displaystyle x = 0
0488018582123} is obtained by this method
 Which is very close to pure value
