 He sourced his entire Parsi theater technique from Britain

 But the folk theater songs, dances, some essential elements of traditional folk humor and their beginning and end rituals were incorporated by the Parsi theater in its storytelling style
 do shreshth paramparaon kaa yah sangam tha or tamaam manchi pradarshan puranic vishyon par hote the jinamein paramparaagat geeton or prabhavi manchi yuktiyon kaa prayog adhik hota tha
 The plots were fabricated and staged in which one person was confused with the other, events played a coincidence, fiery speeches, the thrill of hanging from the rocks, and they were defended at the last moment, the true hero Victory was shown over the evil villain and all of them were credited with song and music

 Since its introduction in the year 1853, the Parsi theater gradually took the form of a 'mobile theater' and people started moving the drama to every corner of the country
 parsi theatre ke abhinay main ‘‘melodrama’’ ahm tatv tha or samvaad adaayagi bade naatakeey tareeke se hoti thi
 He said that even today, elements of Parsi drama are seen in the performance of films
 80 varsh tak parsi rangamanch or iske anek uparupon ne manoranjan ke kshetra main apana sikaa jamaaye rakhaa
 After the arrival of the film, the Parsi Theater duly handed over its tradition to cinema

 The third quality is the costume

 It was considered better for an actor in a Parsi theater to be a good singer because half the story was played in songs
 parsi theatre kaa hi prabhaav he ki aaj hamaare hindi filmon main gane kaa bharpoor prayog kiya jaataa he
 Today, Indian audiences consider the film incomplete without songs
 hamaari aadhunik hindi filmein pashchim ke rielism se prabhavit dikhne lagi he lekin aaj bhi yah parsi theatre kii, gaanaa gaakar baat kehane kii parampara ko kaayam rakhe hue he
 The item song, which has become a passport to the success of Hindi films, traces its roots to the Parsi theater and today even though the elements of this ancient style of acting have disappeared from cinema and theater, but by singing their songs in this theatrical style The style of captivating the audience still continues

 ‘two aspects of a printing’


 are ‘originality in its effectiveness’



 kyonki "supaathya" kaa aam arth "pathneey" hi he phir bhi kuch log hai, jinamein se kuch vyavsaayik rup se typography se jude log bhi hai, jo yah sochate hai ki "supaathyata " ek aisa shabd he jisapar tip kii prabhaavashiltaa ko lekar or bahes kii jarurat he
 But clarity and readability vary, although they are related to the type aspect
 sahi tareeke se janaa hua he ki ye do shabd tip kii visheshta or kaary ke vishleshan ko akele supaathyata shabd kii tulana main bahut hi sankshipt bhang se samajhane main madad kar sakate hai
 


 in typography we need to give a definition of legibility 


 to understand the meaning of clarity and the quality of being easily identifiable - so, for example, we can say that the lower size of the old italic style is lower
 Case h is not clear because its folded leg looks like b; Or a number 3 in a classified ad is very similar to an 8
 


 disple aakaaron main suvachyata ke maamle gambhir hote hai, ek varna jo 8 point par anischitata kaa kaaran hota he vahi 24 point par spasht ho jayega
 It is worth noting that the above principle applies to people with 20 / 20 vision at the appropriate reading distance in the required light
 arth kii swatantraaa or drishy kii tikshnata kii pariksha ke liye ek opticiuns chart kii samanta, spashtataa kii avadharana kii gunjaaish kaa sanket karne ke liye upyogi he
 'in typography 


 if the columns of a newspaper or magazine or the pages of a book can be read for many minutes without stress or difficulty, then we can say that the readability of the type is good
 is baat se drishy aaraam kii gunvattta kaa sanket miltaa he - paath kii lambii vistrut samaj main yah ek mahatvapurn aavashyaktaa he, lekin iske vipareet, telephone nirdeshika yaa hawaii jahaaj kii samay sarini jaisi chizon ke liye yah utana mahatvapurn nahin he, jahaan pathak ise lagaataar padhate nahin hai balki ek choti cheez kii soochna ko dhundte hai
 The difference in both aspects of visual effects is made by a familiar argument of sans-serif's suitability for text setting
 ek vishisht sans-cerife phase ke varna aapas main purna rup se samaj main aa sakate hai, lekin ek prasiddh upanyaas ko koi bhi isamen set karne ke bare main nahin soch saktaa kyonki isaki pathneeyata kam he
 Readability 'relates to direct knowledge' and readability 'refers to understanding'
 Typographers aim to excel in both
 "chunaa hua tiphphes spasht hona chahie
 matlab, yah prayaas ke bina padhaa janaa chahie
 kabhi kabhi spashtataa mahaj tip ke aakaar kaa maamla he
 But very often, this is a case of typeface design
 saamanyat: jo tiperphes buniyadi letterfarm ke najadik hote hai, ve un tiperpheson ke mukaable adhik spasht hote hai jo saghan, faile hue, sanware hue yaa alag hote hai
 However, a clear typeface can also be unreadable due to weak settings and sequence space, just as clear typefaces can be made more readable by good design
 spashtataa or pathneeyata donon ke adhyayan ne tip ke aakaar or dizin sahit anya tatwon ke ek bade range kii jaanch kii he
 For example, comparing serif vs sans serif type, italic type vs roman type, line length, line spacing, color contrast, right edge design vs right extension, and whether the text is hyphenated
 suvachyata anusandhan unnisvin sadi ke baad ke dinon main prakashit kii gai
 Although there are often commonalities and consensus on many topics, others often bring up poignant areas of conflict and diversity of opinion
 udhaaharan ke liye, elex pool ke anusaar kisi ne bhi iskaa antim uttar nahin diya he ki koun phant, ceriphd yaa sans cerriff sabase adhik spashtataa pradaan karata he
 Other topics such as justified vs unzestified, use of hyphen, fonts suitable for people with difficulty reading, such as dyslexia, continue to be debated

 Through such a declaration, i have made sure that any other person can also use or amend it without infringing the copyright
 saadharantay:, copirite kaa arth yah hota he ki koi anya vyakti uskaa prayog athwa sanshodhan uske maalik kii anumati ke na kar sake
 Here the reverse work was done using copyright
 copirite kaa yadi koi ulta shabd ho saktaa he to vah he copileft
 It is a new word and has not yet appeared in the English dictionary, although it is a popular word in the computer dictionary
 jis computer program ke license main is tarah kii ghoshnaa or shart hoti he use copilefted software kaha jaataa he
 This type of software is also called free software
 free shabd kaa prayog karnaa richard stallmen ne shuru kiya or yah aandolan bhi unka hi shuru kiya gaya he

 Stalman felt that in this way the computer software would be left with a few special people and there would be no complete development
 isaliye unhone apana institute ko chhod kar ghanu project, free sours foundation ke antargat shuru kiya
 In this, we started writing software that are copylefted
 unhone is tarah ke saftware ko free-sauftware kaa naam diya
 This is because, according to them, people have the freedom to modify computer programs or software, they say that do not think of free as in free beer but look like it is in freedom of speech
 free sours foundation kii websit ke mutabik, unhi ke shabdon main 'free software' is a matter of liberty, not price
 To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer' The following are the main things in free or copied software - Source code is always published in this, there is no money or royalty to be paid for such software, but if you are giving any service in relation to it, then take the money to provide the service
 Can
 is tarah ke sauftware ko koi bhi sanshodhit kar saktaa he is tarah ke sauftware ko sanshodhan karne ke baad prakashit karne yaa bottne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 You can use it in your organization without publishing or sharing
 par yadi is tarah ke sauftware ko bina sanshodhan kiye yaa sanshodhit karne ke baad baanta jaataa he to usamen vahi sharten rahengin jo ki pehle thim yani ki sorcecode prakashit karnaa padega; anya logon ko sanshodhan karne kii swatantraaa deni hogi; tathaa sauftware ke liye koi paisa yaa royalti nahin lee ja sakati he
 Stalman, with the help of some lawyers, wrote the General Public License, which contained such a declaration and condition that copyleft any software
 isaliye is tarah ke sauftver ko jeepield sauftver bhi kaha jataa he
 That is, free softwares or copylefted softwares or gepyld softwares are synonyms of the same kind of softwares

 amaatr bhoomi main man, kaal, kalnaa, devtaa or prapanch, ye kuch bhi nahin rahete
 This is called an insignificant situation
 vahaan swayamprakash brahm nirantar prakaashmaan rahata he
 According to the wayward system in the Yogi sect, a sequence of Omkarasadhana is prevalent
 uske anusaar "a" samgr sthool jagat kaa dyotak he or uske upar sthit karanjagat kaa vaachak he makaar
 Reason: In Salil, the symbols of the three worlds are the symbols A, u and M
 urdhv gati ke prabhaav se shabdamatraaon kaa makaar main lay ho jaataa he
 Subsequently there is a movement towards quantity
 m paryat gati ko anuswaar gati kehete hai
 Anusvara has a reputation as a dervish in Ardhamatra
 itnaa hone par maatraathit main jane ke liye dwaar khul jaataa he
 In fact, the speed of the amrit starts from the point itself
 tantra shaastra main is prakaar kaa matravibhag nau naadon kii sookshm yogabhumiyaan ke naam se prasiddh he
 In this context, it is worth remembering that Bindu is the name of the impenetrable knowledge of the Vedas, and Nada is the name of the Vimarshan of the Ashekas
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki a, u or m pranav ke in teen avyavon kaa atikaraman karne par arthtatv kaa avashya hi bhed ho jaataa he
 The reason for this is that here the yogi attains omniscience for the knowledge of all things, and then, after being pointed out, he also transcends that knowledge
 arth or gyaan in donon ke upar keval naad hi avshisht rahata he evam naad kii nadant tak kii gati main naad kaa bhi bhed ho jaataa he
 At that time only art or power exists
 jahaan shakti yaa chit shakti praapt ho gai vahaan brahm kaa prakaashmaan hona swat: hi siddh he
 In this way, when the world is distinguished by the subtle utterance of Pranav, power is attained till the end of time
 svachhand tantra main yah dikhaaya gaya he ki urdhv gati main kis prakaar kaarnon kaa parityag hote hote akhand purnatatv main sthiti ho jaati he
 "A" signifies Brahma; It is sacrificed in the heart by pronunciation
 "u" vishnu kaa vaachak hai; uskaa tyaag kanth main hota he tathaa "m" rudra kaa vaachak he ore uskaa tyaag talumadhya main hota he
 Through this system, the perforation of the Brahmagranthi, Vishnugranthi and Rudragranthi is done
 tadnantar bindu he, jo swayan ishwar rup he arthath bindu se kramash: upar kii ore vachyavachak kaa bhed nahin rahata
 The point in the graft is sacrificed
 naad sadashivrupi he
