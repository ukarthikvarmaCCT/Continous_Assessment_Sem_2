 computer main prayog kii jane vaali vah bhashaa jisame angreji aksharo, sankhyao evam chinho kaa prayog karke program likhaa jaataa he, use ucch stareey programing bhashaa kaha jaataa he
 Writing programs in this language is very easy for the programmer, because there is no need to write any instructions in machine code
 jaise -BASIC, cobol,fortran,pascal|ab to ucch stareey programing bhashaao kaa atyant vikaas ho chukaa he
 These programming languages are divided into four categories according to the work - scientific programming languages - they are mainly used to make programs for scientific work, but some of these languages are also those which other than scientific work are also similar
 She does it efficiently
 jaise-algol,basic,pascal,fortran, aadi he
 Business programming languages-related to business functions such as ledger, daily paper, stock etc
, can be done very easily by programs of business programming languages
 jaise-pl1,cobol, DBASE aadi
 Special purpose programming languages - These languages are used to perform various tasks with special ability
 jaise-apl360- periphiral yuktiyaan sarvshereshth anuprayog hetu prayog kii jaati he
 This language came into vogue since 1968
 LOGO- logo kaa vikaas maatr computer shiksha ko saral banane hetu kiya gaya
 Drawing in this language is so simple that even young children can depict
 logo bhashaa main chithran ke liye ek vishesh prakaar kii trikonakar akruti hoti he jise taratal kehete hai
 Displayed on the monitor, the turtle can rotate on either side and back and forth using the language instructions
 jab taratal chalata he to peeche apane maarg par lakeer banaata chalata he
 With this, many types of pictures can be made easily
 bahuuddeshiy bhashaaen- jo bhashaaen samaan rup se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke anek kaaryo ko karne kii kshamta rakhti he, unhe bahuuddeshiy bhashaaen kehete hai
 Such as- BASIC, PASCAL, PL1 | ucch stareey programing bhashaae computer mashin par nirbhar nahin karti
 This is a very important achievement
 program ke prayogkarta ke computer badalane par arthath vibhinn ALU or Control unit main bhi yah program sookshmatam sudhaar ke baad samaan rup se chalata he
 The words used in these languages are in the common English language
 in programing bhashaao main galatiyo kii sambhaavna kam hoti he tathaa galatiyo ko jald dhundhakar sudhara ja saktaa he
 The translator used by the compiler or interpreter program itself informs which line and instructions are in error
 program likhane main kam samay or shram lagata he
 The programs written in these languages take more space in the main memory of the computer than the programs written in machine language and assembly language
 in bhashaao main lacheelaapan nahin hota he anuwadako ke swayan niyantrit hone ke kaaran yah programmer ke niyantran main nahin hota he
 Flexibility implies that certain tasks cannot be done in these programming languages or can be done with extreme difficulty
 phir bhi ucch stareey programing bhashaa kii visheshtaayen uski parisimaao kii apeksha adhik prabhavi hoti he
 Therefore, currently these languages are used
 programing bhashaao ke vikaas ke itihaas par najar daali jaae to dow gres haper kaa naam mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 He developed high-level languages around 1952
 jisame ek compiler kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Two high-level programming languages were developed under the direction of Dr
 Hopper, the first being FLOWMATIC and MATHEMATICS
 FLOWMATIC ek vyavsaayik programing bhashaa thi or MATHEMATICS ek ankaganitiya gananaao main prayukt kii jane vaali bhashaa
 Since then, around 225 high-level programming languages have been developed
 udhaaharan:fortran, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL

 bharat ke jhandaa geet kii rachana shyaamalaal gupt 'parshad' ne kii thi
 From this original 7-song song, the Congress later revised three terms and recognized it as 'jhandagit'
 yah geet na keval rashtriya geet ghoshit hua balki anek naujavaanon or navayuvatiyon ke liye desh par mar mitane hetu prerana kaa strot bhi bana
 The flag song originally written is as follows: - "vijayi vishwa tirangaa pyaara, jhandaa unchaa rahe hamaara" naamak ukt suvikhyath jhandaa geet ko 1938 ke congress adhiveshan main sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 Shyamlal Gupta, who composed this song, was a resident of Narwal in 'councilor' Kanpur

 When it was almost decided that independence was about to be attained, the Congress had selected the country's flag
 lekin ek alag “jhandaa geet” kii jarurat mahasoos kii ja rahi thi
 Ganesh Shankar 'vidyarthi' was convinced of the poetry skills of the councilor
 vidhyaarthee ji ne parshad ji se jhandaa geet likhane kaa anurodh kiya
 Councilor kept trying for several days, but he could not write satisfactory flag song
 jab vidhyaarthiji ne parshad ji se saaf-saaf kah diya ki unhen har haal main kal subah tak "jhandaa geet" chahie, to vah raat main kaagaj-kalam lekar jam gayi
 By midnight, he had written a new song on the flag, but he did not submit it himself
 niraash ho kar raat do baje jab vah sone ke liye lete, achaanak unke bheetar naye bhav umadane lage
 He got up from bed and sat down to write a new song
 parshad ji ko laga jaise unki kalam apane aap chal rahi ho or 'bharat mata' un se vah geet likhaa rahi ho
 The song was- "the victorious world tricolor is cute, our flag is high
" " geet likh kar unhen bahut santosh mila
 As soon as morning, the councilor sent this song to 'vidyarthi' ji, which he liked very much
 jab yah geet mahatma gandhi ke paas gaya, to unhone geet ko chota karne kii salaah di
 Finally, at the 1938 Congress session, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose approved it as the "flag song" of the country
 yah aitihaasik adhiveshan haripura main hua tha
 Netaji performed the flag hoisting and about five thousand people present there sang the song Jhanda composed by Shyamlal Gupta Councilor

 The year after leaving school, he had given such a good solution to a problem by participating in a mathematics competition that his teachers published it in 'annals the Mathematic'
 ukt vidhyalay chhodane par, vah ucchstareey adhyayan ke liye, 'ichole narmel supirior' main bhartee hua

 It was from here that Henry Burgess got his head down and he resolved to continue his deep study of philosophy and science
 apane isi sankalp ke anuroop, 'ichole narmel' kii shiksha samaapt kar, vah adhyaaapak ke rup main, 'liki angers' gaya, jahaan vah do varsh rahaa
 Then went on to teach in 'claremont'
 ab uske vichaaron main praudhata aane lagi thi or 'clermant' ke vidhyaarthee uske subodh evam saras vyakhyanon se bahut prabhavit the
 His public speech on the reasons for laughing, which was published in 1900 under the title 'humor', was given only during the teaching of 'clairemont'

 granth ke rup main, uskaa ukt lekh, 1896 main prakashit hua
 a book published in 1910 called 'time and Free Will' is a translation of this

 saamanyat:, anekta sankhyatmak prathit hoti he, kintu bergasaan ne bataaya ki aantarik anubhavon kii anekta sankhyatmak yaa parimanatmak na hokar gunatmak hi ho sakati he
 Similarly, the reign or the time in which events occur seems to be immortal, or monotonous, but it is always

 In the same year, he justified his appointment by publishing 'maitier et Memvair'
 bergasaan kaa yah granth 1911 main 'matter and memory' naam se angreji main chapa
 Based on the study of mementos in it, he tried to simplify the problem of duality of 'mind and matter'
 aadhunik darshan kii yah gahan samasya thi
 All philosophers, from Rene the Carte to Emanuel Kant, continued to meditate, but the controversy ended with Kant's statement that mind and matter, or nature, have a known-knowledgeable relationship, but the mind knows through intelligence and There are some bounded ways of knowing wisdom
 isliye, vah apni gyey vastuon ko vidrup kar detii he
 This keeps the distinction between behavior and charitable
 bergasaan ne kaant ke mat ko aanshik rup se sweekaar kiya
 He believed that the intellect knows the inner truth only by keeping it in the country
 vah vastuon kaa chaaron ore se nirikshan karti he or unke vividh pakshon kaa, ek ek kar pariganan karti he
 This method of knowledge is not sufficient, because the truth of nature is not static, it is the moving truth
 vah ek nirantar parivartan he, jo prati kshan naveentaayen udghaatit karata rahata he
 Nature is not inanimate matter, it is full of life
 padaarth vah lava he, jise ufanti hui jeevanshkti baahar phenk detii he
 The essence of nature is this life force, which is a continuation
 smriti ke chhichley adhyayan se bhoot ore vartmaan kaa antar siddh hota he, kintu sakshm adhyayan se maaloom hota he ki smriti bhoot ke keval un anshon ko hi prastut karti he, jo vartmaan kriya ke liye aavashyak hai
 Knowledge of the whole truth comes from insight, which is a moving experience just like the stream of life, there is apolitical knowledge, sympathetic knowledge
 bergasaan kii khyaati or badhi
 He had tried to prove the ignorance arising out of Kant's opinion as unrealistic
 san 1900 i

 His philosophical writings were also printed outside France

 Seven years later, in 1907, Bergsan's most famous book 'el Abolition Creatris' appeared
 iskaa angreji anuwaad, 'creative ebolution' 1911 main prakashit hua
 In this book, he tried to elucidate the philosophy which he had proposed in previous texts by considering time and memory related problems, based on a detailed study of biological evolution
 nishkarsh naveen na hone par bhi, pustak bahut ruchikar he, jeev jantuon ke prachur udhaaharan pustak ko maanav man ke bahut sameep laa dete hai
 After the publication of this book, in addition to teaching for 14 years, Bergsan gave speeches from time to time in various cities of Europe and America

 But India needs its own sphere of influence
 " In October 2011, a report published by The Pioneer doubted the drdo's ability to independently develop "seeker technology" for icbms, using technology only to allow the missile to reach more than 10,000 kilometers
 isi report ne bharat ko "sadhak praudyogiki" main sahaayat pradaan karne kii rus kii ichha par jor diya
 The authenticity of this report is disputed by at least one foreign newspaper, making counter-claims that Russia's involvement is unlikely, because if the report about Russian involvement is true, Russia has violated the missile technology control system

 The club continued its winning streak in cup competitions and reached the final stages of the 5 FA Cup in 7 years, joining the club in the final stages of 1905, 1906, 1908, 1910 and 1911
 haalanki club in sabhi final charnon main se ek hi jeet sakaa, yah jeet 1910 ke final main bransale ke vipareet thi jo gudison park main khelaa gaya ek riple tha

 But it was Arthur Cox who brought Newcastle back into the first division with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle, Terry mcdermott and former England captain Kevin Keegan, who were the base of the team
 Newcastle had been at the peak for a long time, including managers such as Jack Charlton, Willie mcfaul and Jim Smith, and players such as Paul Geskoign before the team's performance collapsed in 1989
 baad main, kigan oswaldo ardels ke sthaan par 1992 main ek laghukaalin sanvida par manager ke rup main tinside laut aaye, unhone pehle yah daawa kiya tha ki maatr yahi ek aisa kaam he jo unhen footbal main waapas aane ke liye prerit kar saktaa he
 The Newcastle team struggled at the wrong end of the second division; Sir John Hall was doing everything except to take control of the club and to save Newcastle from reaching the third tier for the first time in its history, they needed a small spell
 apane hi kshetra main portsmouth or bahya kshetron main licester city ke viruddh donon lig game ke final charan main jeetne se unka bachanaa sunishchit ho gaya, licester se unki jeet antim kshan main kiye gaye gol se hui thi, haalanki jais baad main spasht ho gaya, yadi newcastle licester se parajeet ho jaataa to bhi vah batch jaataa

 Coincidentally, Newcastle became first-class winners with a 2–0 away win in Grimsby on 4 May 1993, playing football in an aggressive style and were promoted to the Premier League
 kigan ke samay main, newcastle kii jeet kaa silsilaa aage badhata rahaa, 1993-94 ke satr main unhone apni aakraamak style or tritiy sthaan praapt kar sabko prabhavit kiya, yah ucch shikhar par unki vaapasi kaa pehla satr tha
 Keegan's aggressive game theory led to Newcastle receiving "the Entertainers" title by Sky Television
 The title made further headlines through a 3–0 win against Liverpool
 iske agle satr main newcastle ne apane sheersh score karne vaale khilaadi andrew kol kaa sauda menchester united ke saath kar liya or is satr ke pratham ardhansh main adhikansh samay tak suchi main aage rahane ke baad bhi ant main unhen chhathvaan sthaan mila

 The disappointment of missing the title on 30 July 1996 was somewhat mitigated when the club contracted Ellen Shearer for £ 15 million, the then world-class remuneration
 1996-97 ke satr main ek baar phir newcastle sambhavit vijeta manchester united ko saint james park main 5-0 se haraane ke baavjood bhi duusare sthaan par hi rahaa
 is satr main club bhi yuiefee cap ke quarter final main pahunch gaya tha
 The shocking resignation of Keegan in early January 1997 led to a lot of deep dissatisfaction and confusion among supporters, though many believed it had started since the 1995 / 96 season of the title win
 It had already happened
 keni delgish unke uttaradhikari ke rup main aaye or lig main doosraa sthaan paane main club kaa netritv kiya, unhone kigan dwaara banaaye gayi team main koi parivartan nahin kiya
 However, his fortunes were soon reversed due to the injuries suffered by the players and the market transfer of the 1997–98 season, as well as new players who were not able to match the players who were contracted
 , Thus the club finished 11th in the league and failed to win the FA Cup final
 Delgish left at the beginning of the 1998–99 season and after that, Rude Gullit took over the reins of the team
 After contracting the players, the club once again reached the final of the FA Cup but failed to win
 Shortly the following season, Gullit had differences with the team and with chairman Freddie Shepherd, which led to the manager publicly apologizing and stating that he had no feud with captain Ellen Shearer
 gulit ne satr 1999 / 2000 main 8 match purv club ko chhod diya
 Former England captain Bobby Robson was appointed as the new manager
 kaman sanbhaalane ke baad unka pehla gharelu match vishesh rup se yaadgaar or prabhaavshaalee tha; jisame newcastle ne sheffield vencede par 8-0 se jeet hasil kii thi, yah aaj tak club kii gharelu jeet kaa ek kirtiman he
 Such good performances ensured the club's presence in the Premier League in Robson's first season, although the team could not be selected for Europe the following season
 The 2001–02 season, however, saw some challenges and after finishing fourth, Newcastle qualified for the Champions League

 Initially the director of the Youth Academy, Glenn Roeder, temporarily replaced Sounes
 unke netritv main khele gaye pehle match main ellen shieror ne jeki milbern ko club ke sarvaadhik gol karne vaale khilaadi ke sthaan se hataa kar swayan unka sthaan le liya
 In just three-and-a-half months, Roeder was eventually made the team's full-time manager as his leadership moved the team from 15th to 7th place
 yogadan or puraskaron se anugrihit hokar shieror ne 2005-06 ke satr ke ant main avkaash le liya, unhone ab tak club ke liye kul 206 gol kiye the
 Even after a good end to the 2005–06 season, Roeder's fortunes were overturned in the 2006–07 season, due to the event that he relied on youth academy players to compete in the Premier League and Europe
 Having done so and to this day is seen as the worst loss of senior players in the history of the club, he left the club on 6 May 2007 by mutual consent
 sam alrdise ko 15 may ko roder ke sthaan par manager ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya or baad main yah adhyaksh ke rup main fredy shefrd dwaara kiya gaya antim kaary ban gaya, jinhone 7 june ko anichhaapurvak apane antim share club main mike eshle ko bech die or unka sthaan nae adhyaksh kris mort ne le liya
 Despite making a promising start to the season, Newcastle Bottom Club lost to Derby County and on 9 January 2008 based on mutual agreement after taking command for less than 8 months due to the absence of fan favorite players from the opening queue

 april 1997 main, premier lig ke bich shuru hue nae chalanon ke anusaar, sar jon haul kii adhyakshata main club ko public limited company ke rup main stock exange main jari kar diya gaya, iske peeche ek bade sporting club newcastle ko aarthik sahaayta dene kaa uddeshy bataaya gaya

3 pratishat daavedaari kharidne ke baad puri tarah se club par adhikaar karne ke mansoobey bana rahaa tha
 Later in April 1999, its control was also suspended after the Competition Commission ceased its proposed control of Manchester by Rupert Murdoch, owner of beeskyb

 Newcastle United plc's shares went unlisted from the London Stock Exchange at 8 am on 18 July 2007, with Shepherd and other directors leaving the club the following month
 jabaki mike eshle, holding company or is prakaar club ke bhi akele maalik hai, tab bhi unhone swayan ko club ke nideshak board main koi aadhikarik pad nahin diya he, pehle unhone vishram kii avasthaa main kris mort ko adhyakshata di or 2008 / 09 satr ke prarambh ke samay derek llembias ko di
 On 14 September 2008, after fans protested over Keegan's surprise resignation, Ashley announced that he was about to issue an offer to sell the club, stating "I have listened to you
" aap log chaahate hai ki mai chalaa jaaun
 ab mai yahi karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa hum
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unhone club ko kharidne main or karjon ko nipataane main kul 244 million pound kharch kiye the
 It was estimated by the inspectors that this is a deal that will attract many buyers, so he may not be able to sell the club for more than £ 300 million in total

 On 7 June 2009, Ashley confirmed that the club had proposed to sell for £ 100 million and asked potential buyers to email them with their offers
 On 12 August 2009, Ashley returned from her vacation after receiving no proposal and began to see another possibility of staying in the club for another year
 5 agast 2008 ke rup main Presently the club's main sponsor is Northern Rock Bank and sports goods company Puma

 daksh prajapati ko anya prajapatiyon ke samaan brahma ji ne apane maanas putr ke rup main utpann kiya tha
 Daksha Prajapati was married to Sushyambhu Manu's third girl child
 daksh raajaaon ke devtaa the
 Brahma's son Daksha Prajapati was married to Prasuti, daughter of Swayambhuva Manu
 prasuti ne solah kanyaon ko janm diya jinamein se swaha naamak ek kanya kaa agni dev ke saath, swadha naamak ek kanya kaa pitrugan ke saath, sati naamak ek kanya kaa bhagwaan shankar ke saath or shesh teraa kanyaon kaa dharm ke saath vivaah hua
 The names of the wives of the religion were - Shraddha, Friendship, Mercy, Peace, Satisfaction, Confirmation, Action, Advancement, Wisdom, Medha, Titika, Hri and Murthy
 vishnupurana or padmapurana ke anusaar daksh kii kul 24 kanyaayein thim, jinke naam nimnlikhit hai- After Daksha became Prajapati, Brahma gave him a task under which to reconcile Shiva and Shakti
 us samay shiv tathaa shakti donon alag the
 That is why Brahma Ji told Daksh that he meditated and please Shakti Mata and get her as a daughter
 tapasya ke uparaant mata shakti ne daksh se kaha,"main aapaki putree ke rup main janm lekar shambhu kii bharya banungi
 When the virtue of your austerity is diminished and you are disrespected by me, then i will go to my abode with my illusion to dislodge the world
 is prakaarasti ke rup main shakti kaa janm hua
 Prajapati Daksha has three views on the form of being nomadic to Lord Shiva
 ek mat ke anusaar prarambh main brahma ke paanch sir the
 Brahma used to perform Vedpath with his three heads and abused Veda with two heads so that Shiva cut off one of his heads
 brahma daksh ke pita the
 So Daksha became angry and started talking to Shiva for revenge
 lekin yah mat anya pramanik sandarbhon se khandit ho jaataa he
 In the Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana it is clearly described that Brahma had only four heads at the time of birth
 duusare mat ke anusaar shakti dwaara swayan bhavishyavaanee rup main daksh se swayan ke bhagwaan shiv kii patni hone kii baat kah diye jane ke baavjood daksh shiv ko sati ke anuroop nahin maanate the
 So, when Sati was married, she organized a swayamvara for him and did not call Shiva in it
 phir bhi sati ne 'shivaay namah' kahkar varmala prithvi par daal di or vahaan prakat hokar bhagavan shiv ne varmala grahan karke sati ko apni patni banaakar kailash chale gayi
 Thus Daksha did not like Shiva because of his daughter Sati choosing Shiva as her husband against her will
 teesraa mat sarvaadhik prachlit he
 According to this, on the arrival of Daksha in a yajna of Prajapati, all the gods got up and respected him, but Shiva also remained seated with Brahma ji
 shiv ko apana jamata arthath putr samaan hone ke kaaran unke dwaara khadey hokar aadar nahin diye jane se daksh ne apana apmaan mahasoos kiya or unhone shiv ke prati katuctiyon kaa prayog karte hue ab se unhen yajna main devataaon ke saath bhaag na milane kaa shaap de diya
 Thus both of them became psychotic
 ukt ghatana ke baad prajapati daksh ne apni rajdhani kankhal main ek viraat yajna kaa aayojan kiya, jisamen unhone apane jamata shiv or putree sati ko yajna main aane hetu nimantrit nahin kiya
 Even after Shankar ji's explanation, Sati went without calling her father's yagna
 yajyasthal main daksh prajapati ne sati or shankar ji kaa ghor niraadar kiya
 Unable to bear the insult Sati immediately consumed herself with Yogagni in the sacrificial fire
 sati kii mrityu kaa samachar paakar bhagavan shankar ne virbhadra ko utpann kar uske dwaara us yajna kaa vidhwans kara diya
 Virbhadra also beheaded the head of Daksha Prajapati while giving appropriate punishment to the gods and sages who were opposing and ridiculing Lord Shiva
 baad main brahma ji ke dwaara prarthana kiye jane par bhagavan shankar ne daksh prajapati ko uske sir ke badale main bakre kaa sir pradaan kar uske yajna ko sampann karavaaya
 There are clearly three stages in the development of the story of daksha-yajna-demolition
 is katha ke pratham charan kaa rup mahabharat ke shantiparv main he
 This primary form of the story also supports Daksha's sacrifice performed in Kankhal
 yahan kankhal main yajna hone kaa spasht ullekh to nahin he, parantu gangadwar ke desh main yajna hona ullikhit he or kankhal gangadwar ke antargat hi aata he
 In this story, Yajna of Daksha is destroyed but Sati is not consumed
 vastutah sati kailash par apane pati bhagwaan shankar ke paas hi rahati he or apane pita daksh dwaara unhen nimantran tathaa yajna main bhaag nahin diye jane par atyadhik vyakul rahati he
 Due to his distraction, Shiva generates Veerabhadra from his mouth and he goes with the ganas to destroy the yagna
 parantu, na to virbhadra daksh kaa sir katata he or na hi use bhasma karata he
 Naturally, there is no question of adding a goat's head
 vastutah is katha main 'yajna' kaa sir kaatane arthath puri tarah 'yajna' ko nasht kar dene kii baat kahi gayi he, jise baad kii kathaon main 'daksh' kaa sir kaatane se jod diya gaya
 In this legend Daksha praises Shiva by 1008 names and Lord Shiva is pleased and gives him a boon
 is katha ke vikaas ke duusare charan kaa rup shrimadbhagwat mahapurana se lekar shiv puraana tak main varnit he
 In this, Sati stubbornly indulges in Yajna and gets angry and is consumed by Yogagni
 swaabhaavik he ki jab sati yogagni main bhasma ho jaati he to unki laash kahaan se bachegi ! isliye unki laash lekar shivaji ke bhatakane aadi kaa prashn hi nahin uthta he
 No such indication is found at this stage of the narrative
 is katha main virbhadra shivaji kii jataa se utpann hota he tathaa daksh kaa sir kaat kar jala detaa he
 As a result, the head of the goat is added to it
 katha ke vikaas ke tisare charan kaa rup devipurana jaise uppurana main varnit hua he
 In which Sati is burnt and the Yajna of Daksha is also destroyed by Virabhadra
 yahan virbhadra shivaji ke tisare netra se utpann hota he tathaa daksh kaa sir bhi kaata jaataa he
 Then Shiva ji is happy to praise and Daksha is also alive and Virabhadra adds the head of a goat to him
 parantu, yahan puranakar katha ko or aage badhaate hai tathaa baad main bhagwaan shiv ko punah sati kii laash surakshit tathaa dedeepyaman rup main yajyashala main hi mil jaati he
 Then Shivji wanders like a deranged with that corpse and Lord Vishnu is gradually cut the corpse from the chakra in block-by-volume form
 is prakaar laash ke vibhinn angon ke vibhinn sthanon par girane se 51 shakti peethon kaa nirmaan hota he
 It is clear that it would have taken centuries or millennia until this third form of the story came
 is tarah sati ke sharir kaa jo hissaa or dhaaran kiye aabhushan jahaan-jahaan gire vahaan-vahaan shakti peeth astitv main aa gayi
 The number of Shaktipeeths is given in different texts
 tantrachudamani main shaktipeethon kii sankhya 52 bataai gayi he
 There are 108 Shaktipeeths mentioned in Devi Bhagwat, then 72 Shaktipeeths are mentioned in Devi Gita
 devipurana main 51 shaktipeethon kii charchaa kii gayi he
 Traditionally, there are 51 Shaktipeeths among the devotees and Sudhijans

 He was originally turk-indian, whose father was Turk and mother Hindu
 gayasuddin tughlaq ne paanch varshon tak shashan kiya or dilli ke sameep ek nayaa nagar tughluqabad basaaya

 1339 se, purvi bhaagon main muslim soobedaaron ne or dakshini bhaagon se hindu raajaaon ne baghawat kaa jhanda buland kiya or dilli sultanate se apane ko swatantra ghoshit kar diya
 Muhammad bin Tughluq did not have the necessary resources to deal with these rebellions, which led to his empire shrinking

 parantu phir bhi bengal dilli sultanate main shaamil na ho paaya
