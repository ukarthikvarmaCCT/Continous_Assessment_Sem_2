 In cases of major incidents, the subjects can point to a potentially suspicious conspiracy - in which the head of the organization was killed - then other evidence available to them should be similar compared to other cases

 Mark Fenster argues that "just because archaic conspiracy theories are wrong, it does not mean that they cannot do anything wrong
 In particular, they address theoretically real structural injustice, for a shabby civil society

 Alternatively, conspiracy theories may arise when the evidence available in the public record does not coincide with the general or official version of events
 Conspiracy theories in this regard can sometimes uncover blind spots in common or official interpretations of events

 There is a tendency in the media that if an incident happens, it starts searching for the culprits and it is so important that it does not remove it from its news agenda within a few days
 With this trend, it has been said that there is no place in the news for the concept of a pure accident
 Again, if this is a correct observation, it may reflect in that real change in how the media consumer views negative events

 This then suspiciously justifies a happy ending, although the audience expects it, but in fact another effect comes in the form of exaggerating the feeling of false and fictional stories, and in fact it It justifies losing public confidence in the statement of mass media
 vishwaas ke nuksaan se jo shunya paidaa hota he, vah shadyantr ke siddhant ke spashtikaran ko dhwast kar detaa he

 The major new development, reports Barkun, professor of political science in the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, is not just an erosion in the divisions between these two groups, but their joining forces with occultists, individuals bored by rationalism
 Occultists are drawn to what Barkun calls the "cultural dumping ground of the heretical, the scandalous, the unfashionable, and the dangerous" - such as spiritualism, theosophy, alternative medicine, alchemy, and astrology
 Thus, the author who worries about the Secret Service taking orders from the Bavarian Illuminati is old school; the one who worries about a "joint reptilian-bavarian Illuminati" takeover is at the cutting edge of the new synthesis
 These bizarre notions constitute what Michael Kelly termed "fusion paranoia," Conspiracy theories exist in the realm of myth, where imaginations run wild, fears trump facts, and evidence is ignored

 Guerrillas used to attack enemy targets at night

 Soon after the country was authorized, the people there formed a guerrilla team headed by Josip Vrozovic who worked against the enemy army

 Communication was carried out as far as possible by radio sets snatched from the enemy party
 yugoslavia ke is dal kaa uddeshy shatru ke un sampann lakshyon par akraman karnaa tha jo durbal the or jahaan akraman hone kii sabase kam apeksha kii jaati thi
 Apart from this, at any stage they did not want to give such an opportunity that the enemies could retaliate against them

 Civil behavior is of utmost importance in all partisan wars

 Thousands of men, women and children were killed

 In a period of three years, the enemy attacked seven times to destroy the guerrillas and also resorted to the Air Force, but each time Tito's counterpart survived somehow and the axis reappeared to attack the nation at such a place
 Where his attack could not be expected
 aadhunik vayusena or chhapamaron ke sahyog se kya parinaam nikal sakate hai, yugoslavia iskaa pramaan he
 The attack of the guerrillas on the communication system of the enemy has an important place in the success of the Russians

 Their main function was to receive and transmit secret news

 After the spread of these parties, there was difficulty in arranging mutual communication among the parties
 is kathinaayee ko dur karne ke liye chhapamaron ne janata ke chote radio seton se kaam liya
 Later in 1942, a direct radio connection of the partisan troops was established with General macarthur's main office in Australia

 It was soon planned to launch forces on various islands

 Thus the espionage operations carried out by the guerrillas helped General macarthur to revive the region and plan his actions

 In the same year, the British combined the Ketchins in Burma for raiding

 In order to enable these people to stay longer behind the enemy army, a supportive environment was also created in that area

 Special emphasis was given to the swift retreat by small contingents, rapid retreat, scatter and regroup

 Even today the guerrillas move at a rapid pace, cheating and attacking the enemy where they are most vulnerable

 Along with the vulnerability of the weapons, equipment, military installations etc
 used in the war, with the help of which rapid attack or interception is possible, the area of guerrillas is also increasing

 The early escalation of collisions in the Second World War increased the chances of the guerrillas entering the enemy army and at some places even the regular army troops reached the background of the enemy
 ab to chhapamaron or nagarikon ke sahyog se kiye ja sakanevaale chhapamari ke kaaryon kaa kshetra atyant vishaal ho gaya he
 In these types of wars, it has become mandatory to get the help and good wishes of the public

 Where the path opened for the guerrillas to get help from these means, these tools also started to be used to chase them
 phir bhi inamen haani kii apeksha laabh adhik hua
 Earlier, the guerrillas were rarely able to get news of their partners, but now with the help of small portable senders, they got the facility to contact their partners at will
 phir vayuyanon, dwaara chapa tathaa anya sabhi prakaar kii aniyamit senaaon ko utaarne, unhen lene, unki shakti ko sudrudh banane or pradaay tathaa samrik mahatv kii anya vastuon ko unhen uplabdh karaane kaa bhi kaary sampann hone laga
 The main task of the guerrillas is to destroy the material that the enemy forces get from their back
 aanvik shastron ke vikaas ko dekhte hue samrik niti badalegi
 The armies will divide into small contingents
 pradaay stroton, yuddh aadhaaron, udyogon tathaa anya samrik vyavastha kaa vikendrikaran karnaa aavashyak hoga
 Consequently, if molecular power is used, the guerrillas will become smaller in size and more conserving
 parinaam yah hoga ki chhapamari kaa kshetra vishaal or adhik prabhavi ban jaayga
 The regular army will also fight in small squads
 in paristhitiyon main chhapamar yuddh hi vishesh safal ho sakenge
 It would not be unfair to say that guerrilla warfare will be of major importance only when the use of nuclear weapons in war and other methods will remain in common use

 India has a poor literacy rate of 66 percent, ranked 149 in the World Literacy Ranking, with its report given by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2007 and included in the 2009 United Nations Development Program Report
 vastav main, shiksha jo ek sanvaidhanik adhikaar tha shuru main ab ek moulik adhikaar kaa darja praapt he
 The development for the right to education has happened in this way: At the beginning of the Constitution of India, the right to education was recognized under Article 41 of the Directive Principles of State Policy according to which, "rajya apni aarthik kshamta or vikaas kii simaaon ke bheetar, shiksha or berogari, vriddhavastha, beemaari or viklaangata ke maamle main saarvajanik sahaayta karne ke liye kaam karte hai, sahi hasil karne ke liye prabhavi vyavastha karne or naahak ke anya maamalon main chaahate hai "
 The assurance of free and compulsory education was made again under the Principles, under the Directive Article 45 of the State Policy, which runs as follows, "an attempt to provide for the State, within a period of ten years shall be free and compulsory education
 For all children of this constitution from the beginning until they complete the age of fourteen
 " In addition, with providing education, 46 articles also related to schedule castes, schedule tribes and other weaker sections of the society
 The fact that the right to education has been dealt with in article 3 as well as dealt with under Part IV of the Constitution explains how important it has been perceived by the framers of the Constitution
 29 lekh or aalekh shiksha ke adhikaar ke saath 30 samjhaute or ab, ham anuchhed 21A he, jo ek majboot tareeke se aashwaasan ab detaa he
 In 2002, the Constitution Act came to be recognized as a fundamental right through the right to education
 lekh 21A isliye sammilit hona jisamen kaha gaya he aayaa, "rajya rajya ke rup main is tareeke se, vidhi dwaara, nirdhaarit kar sakate main chah se chaudaa varsh kii aayu ke sabhi bacchon ko muft or anivaary shiksha pradaan karegaa
we should punish those teachers who just sitv in the classes not teaching the studentsyaha antat unni krishnan jepi ve
 rajya andhra pradesh kii ki shiksha ko ek moulik adhikaar main laayaa ja rahaa main diya nirnay kiya gaya tha
 Even after this, it involved a lot of struggle to bring about Article 21A and later, the Right to Education Act
 Therefore, a raw draft bill for the RTE Act was proposed in 2005
 bacchon ke adhikaar ko ni: shulk or anivaary shiksha adhinium, lokapriy shiksha kaa adhikaar adhinium ke rup main janaa april, 2010 ke 1 ko prabhaav main aayaa tha
 The RTE Act was passed on 4 August 2009 by the Parliament of India on 2 July 2009 and by the Cabinet Ministry on 20 July 2009, after the approval of the Rajya Sabha on 20 July 2009
 raashtrapati pratibha patil ne is vidheyak ko manjuuri de di he uske or is ke rajptr main ni: shulk bachche ke adhikaar par or anivaary shiksha adhinium ke rup main adhishuchet kiya gaya sitambar, 2009 3
 1 april 2010 par, yah bharat ke jammu or kashmir rajya ko chhodkar, puraa karne ke liye lagu ke rup main astitv main aayaa
 Thus, in the end a very important right is an important right that is how it took shape after recovery from the situation
 shiksha kaa adhikaar 86 of the Constitution was added by Amendment Act 2002 which provides that the State shall by law make it mandatory for free education compulsory for all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years
 is adhikaar ko vyavhaarik rup dene ke liye sansad main nishulk evam anivaary shiksha adhinium 2009 paarit kiya
 Which came into force from 1 April 2010

 bhoot or vartmaan kaal ke aankadon ke aadhaar par bimaavigya hamen batalaata he ki prati second ek manushya mar jaataa he
 In this way, someone is dying all the time
 tab bhi ham apane dainik kaaryon main kabhi is vichaar ko paas fatakane nahin dete
 If we keep thinking for the most part of all the time that we should not become grasps of Kaal at the next moment, then life will become difficult and hopeless
 aisa kyon he? isliye ki ham sabhi main kuch na kuch "bimaavigya" kaa ansh vidyaman he
 In a day, perhaps one in 25 thousand human beings turn up to die, so it is natural that everyone considers himself in 24,999
 is hisaab se kah sakate hai ki ek manushya ko agle choubees ghanton main mrityu kii sambhaavna 25 hajaar main ek, yaa 1 / 25000 = 0
 xxrep 4 0 4, baar he or choubees ghante jivit rahane kii sambhaavna 0
 xxrep 4 9 6 baar he
 Together, there must definitely be one, because there is no third way to survive or not to live
 uparyukt gananaa main sab manushyon ko ekasaan mrityushil mana gaya he, par vastav main aisa nahin he
 What types of humans are to be considered the same and what types of humans are considered different and how different from them, these are all complex questions and it is the job of insurance experts to solve them
 or to or, jab koi vyakti jeevanavritti ke liye aavedanpatr detaa he, to uski matryata kam maani jaati he or jab vahi vyakti jivan bime kaa prastaav rakhata he tab bahudhaa uski doctori pariksha kii jaati he or phir bhi "matryata" kuch adhik maani jaati he
 Suppose Sanai is a 20-year-old healthy young man
 uske vyavsaay, vanshaparampara, rahan sahan aadi sab kaa vichaar kar beemaa vijna ne yah nishchit kiya ki ek varsh main sanai jaise ek hajaar vyaktiyon main se do ke marane kii aashaa he, to ham kahenge ki matryata kii vaarshik dar hajaar main do, athwa 0

 Insurers predict a category or group based on data
 unhen kisi vyaktivishesh main koi ruchi nahin hoti
 They want to help the family of those who died
 iske liye unhone beemaa yojanaayen banaai hai
 They tell the earning youth, "get insurance in one of our life insurance plans
" asamay main maranevaalon kaa bhala hoga, jenevaalon kaa bhi bhala hoga
 "" There is a big difference between life insurance and other types of beams that once the item insured in other beams is repaired, the same item can be recovered from the sum assured
 usamen bimaakrit vastu kaa mulya hota he, kintu jivan kaa mulya nahin hota
 Life insurance cannot be guaranteed
 jivan lautaaya nahin ja saktaa
 The financial loss to the dependents can be reduced or reduced by the death of the earning person with insurance
 yahi kaam prayek jivan beemaa yojana karti he
 Even if Sanai dies after three months of getting insurance, his dependents will get full insurance money
 bimaavigya jaanate hai ki thode se logon kaa beemaa karne se bhavishyavaanee ke ankon or vaastavik ankon main antar adhik ho saktaa he, par bade paimaane par beemaa karne se bhavishyavaanee adhik sahi utarati he
 Therefore, no insurable person should be left without insurance
 saath hi bimaavigya yah bhi jaanate hai ki aswasth manushya adhik sugamawa se beemaa karaane ko taiyaar ho jate hai tathaa is prakaar ke hi log sugamawa se badi rakamon kaa beemaa prastaav karte hai
 Therefore, they take special care in relation to insurance proposals of large amount and older people and also recommend proper medical examination
 bade paimaane par bime kaa kaam karne se bimaakrit jansamooh se bahut badi dhanrashi aati he
 With such a large amount of money, good interest can be earned
 jivan beemaa nigam ke paas lagbhag saat arab rupayon kii dhanrashi he, jisase byaaj aadi ke rup main kai karod rupee vaarshik praapt hote hai

 The general information about the school is as follows: - varun hindu dharm ke ek pramukh devtaa hai
 His place in the ancient Vedic religion was very important, but his form in the Vedas is so abstract that its natural depiction is difficult
 mana jaataa he ki varun kii sthiti anya vaidic devataaon kii apeksha pracheen he, isiilie vaidic yug main varun kisi prakritik upadan kaa vaachak nahin he
 The amount of hymns addressed to Varuna is much less than that of Agni and Indra, yet its importance is not less
 indra ko mahaan yoddha ke rup main janaa jaataa he to varun ko naitik shakti kaa mahaan poshak mana gaya he, vah rut kaa poshak he

 In later mythology, Varuna was made a minor water god

 Nihilism or nothingness is the doctrine or doctrine of the department called Madhyamah, the Mahayana branch of Buddhists, in which the world is considered void and all its substances as powerless
 "madhyamik nyaay" ne "shoonyavad" ko darshanik siddhant ke rup main angeekrut kiya he
 According to this, both the known and the knowledge are imaginary
 parmaarthik tatv ekmaatr "shunya" hi he
 The "zero" essence is different from these four categories, asat, samsat and samsadvilakasana
 jagat is "shunya" kaa hi vivart he
 The root of Vivarta is Vavruti, which is also known as Avidya and Lust
 is mat ke anusaar karmkleshon kii nivritti hone par manushya nirvana praapt kar usee prakaar shant ho jaataa he jaise tel or batti samaapt hone par pradeep
 In Nagarjuna's view, the basic element is nothing other than zero
 dhyaan dene kii baat yah he ki yah shunya koi nishedhaatmak vastu nahin he jiskaa aplaap kiya ja sake
 It is possible to use only four categories in the design of any substance - parmarth in chaaron kotiyon se mukt hota he or isiilie uske abhidhaan ke liye "shunya" shabd kaa prayog ham karte hai
 In the words of Nagarjuna shoonyavad kii siddhi ke liye nagarjun ne vidhvansaatmak tark kaa upyog kiya he - vah tark, jiske sahare padaarth kaa vishleshan karte karte vah keval shunyarup main tik jaataa he
 On the strength of this argument, Nagarjuna has the credit for making a very serious, touching and original discussion of elements like matter, speed, caste, time, connection, soul, etc
 is mat main satya do prakaar kaa hota he - The first of which indicates practical power arising out of avidya; The second wisdom is the exponent of truth generated
 "sanvruti" shabd kaa arth he avidya
 Being indistinguishable, practical truth is known as communicative truth
 satya kii yah dwividh vyakhya nagarjun kii drushti main shoonyavad ke dwaara udbhavit nutan kalpana nahin he, pratyut buddha ke dwaara hi pracheen kaal main sanketit kii gai he
 Some of Buddha's teachings are given on the basis of practical truths; Other sermons are postponed above the orthodox truth
 abhisht donon he buddha ko - Nagarjuna, despite being a philosopher, was not a teacher who ignored behavior
 ve jaanate hai ki vyavhaar kaa bina aashray liye parmarth kaa upadesh hi nahin ho saktaa or parmarth kii prapti ke abhaav main nirvana mil nahin saktaa
 The intellect of ordinary human beings is so obsessed with behavior that behavior cannot be practiced to bring it to the altar
 falat: vyavhaar kii asatyata parmarth shabdon ke dwaara pratipaadya vastu nahin he
 That is why he is known by the designation of "illiteracy"
 parmarthatatv buddhivyapaar itani aasakt he ki use parmarth path par laane ke liye vyavhaar kaa aplaap nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As a result, by showing "untruth" of behavior, a seeker has to be distinguished in charity
 parmarth shabdon ke dwaara pratipaadya vastu nahin he
 That is why we know him by designation of the non-literal element
 parmarthatatv buddhivyapaar se agochar, avishay, sarvaprapanchanirmukt tathaa kalpanavirahit he, parantu uske upar jaagtik padaarthon kaa samarope karne se hi uskaa gyaan hamen ho saktaa he
 This element bears a similar resemblance to the supervention and exception of Vedantis

 Jan Shatabdi Express is a train operated by Shatabdi Express of Indian Railways, whose journey time and route are similar to Shatabdi Express, but they are also available without air conditioning
 is kaaran inke kiraaye main shatabdi express ke mukaable kaafii kami he
 Currently 32 Janshatabdi Express trains are in operation
 inaki suchi is prakaar se he:- This tehsil is located in Kushinagar district, Uttar Pradesh
 2011 main hui bharat kii janaganana ke anusaar is tehsil main 405 gaanv hai
 Frictionless metals and mishratu are metals and mishratu that help to reduce the coefficient of friction between two machine-parts that rotate and are also reduced due to friction
 ghoomanevaalon chakkon athwa pahiyon ke abaadh gati se chalate rahane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki jis dhuree par ve ghumte hai, vah ghiskar patali na hone paae or na garam hi ho sake
 Lubricants have generally been used to avoid this difficulty, but using only lubricants for fast moving machines proves to be unsuccessful in preventing wear and tear
 isi prakaar jab kisi mashin kaa ek bhaag uske duusare bhaag par baraabar ghumta he, tab vahaan bhi ragad tathaa ghisaai se bachane kaa upaay aavashyak hota he
 For this measure, concrete is made from some special metals of the shape of ball or cylinder at the points of machines and wheels where the effect of grinding and rubbing is effected
 ye us mashin athwa chakke ke ghoomane ke saath-saath swayan bhi apni jagah par ghoomte rahete hai
 They have full pressure on the wear of the machine
 in thoson ko bering kaha jaataa he
 These bearings are placed in a strong groove or placenta made of metal, in which even when moving around, they should not be able to move from their fixed position
 bering banane ke liye vishesh dhaatu evam mishradhaatuon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo gati se ghoomte rahane par bhi gharshan evam taap ke kaaran na to ghisne paati hai or na dabaav padane par tut hi paati hai
 The use of hard metals is not always useful to minimize wear to the effect of friction, because heat is produced quickly when hard metals are rubbed and on the part of the machine running on such hard metal bearings
 , Reads harmful effects of wear
 is kuprabhav ko rokane tathaa gharshangunank ko kam se kam rakhane ke liye aisi mulaayam dhaatu evam mishradhaatuon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jo adhik se adhik agharshneey hon tathaa saath hi tikaoo bhi hon
 As the speed of machines increases, new types of bearings metals and alloys are invented
 kisi vishesh gati evam mashin ke upyukt hi bering dhaatuon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he
 For this, metals like Vung, Lead, Copper, Iron, Antimony, Zinc, Arsenic, Bismuth, Cadmium, Nickel, Silver and Phosphorus are used in more quantity in making alloys
 neeche kuch aisi mahatvapurn mishradhatuen di gai hai, jinka prayog agharshneey dhaatu ke rup main bade paimaane par hota he : Vung, copper and antimony alloys have been used for making bearings for the last more than a century
 1839 i
 main ijak babit ne is mishradhatu kaa avishkaar bering banane ke liye kiya
 It contains about 89
3 per cent Wang, 8
9 per cent Antimony, and 1
8 percent copper
 vang swayan bahut mulaayam dhaatu he, kintu tanba tathaa antimony ke saath milakar yah bahut kadi mishradhatu banaata he
 Lead is also used in place of wang to make some special bearings in babbit metal
 babit mattl main jasta, loha, athwa aluminium kii upasthiti hanikaarak hoti he
 Lead, antimony and copper alloys are mixed with up to 15 per cent antimony and up to 20 per cent
 shesh sisa rahata he
 Alloys made in this way are very hard and abrasive
 arsenic, antimony tathaa sise kii mishradhatu kaa upyog, jisamen arsenic kii maatra 1 se 3 pratishat se adhik nahin rahati, unche taap par chalanevaali mashiinon ke bering banane main kiya jaataa he
 Alloys mixed with cadmium and nickel are used to make bearings running in high-quality and heavy machines
 isamen 1
35 prati shat nickel or 98
65 pratishat cadmium, athwa 2
25 pratishat chaandi, 0
25 prati shat tanba tathaa 97
50 pratishat cadmium kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Bearings made from it are used in aircraft etc
 is dhaatu se bani bering kaa upyog kuch vishesh prakaar kii mashiinon main hi hota he, jahaan mashin kii gati saadhaarant: kam hoti he tathaa taap 150¬∞ sein
 se upar nahin pahunchataa
 In cold countries, its bearings are used to apply motor parts and in places where there is heavy pressure of friction
 == shrenee:dhaatu]] The yi sutra is a virtue formula that identifies gender in any mammalian category of animal
 in jeevon main keval aise do ling-bhed karne vaale gun sutara hote hai - eks gun sutara or vaai gun sutara
 They are named after the letters "X" and "Y" in English because their shapes are similar to them
 naron main ek vaai or ek eks gun sutara hota he, jabaki maadaaon main do eks gun sutara hote hai
 Generally, the only y property formula of any father goes to his sons without any change
 isliye vaai gun sutara ke adhyayan se kisi bhi purush ke pitruvansh samooh kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 a gene called SRYY is present on the y property formula which allows the body to develop testicles at the developmental age of the male
 angrezi main 'vaai gun sutara' ko 'vaay chromosome' kehete hai
