 The term is also used in the derogatory sense of automatic dismissal of claims that are ridiculous, nonsensical, insane, baseless, bizarre or irrational

 According to Burlett and Lyons, "conspiracyism is a particular narrative form of the scapegoat, which lures fiendish enemies into a larger internal conspiracy against a generally good deed, while it calls that scapegoat ringing alarm bells Valleys as a hero
 " Conspiracy theories are the subject of widespread criticism by academics, politicians and media

 The term "conspiracy theory" has been termed by various observers to be a fair description of a conspiracy claim, a derogatory term used to dismiss such a claim without examination and to promote such a claim
 This word is also used to indicate positive support by givers
 kuch logon dwaara is shabd kaa prayog vaise tark ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jin par ve puri tarah vishwaas nahin karte, lekin ise parivartanamoolak or romaanchak maanate hai
 The most widely accepted meaning of the word is that which is in the practice of popular culture and educational usage, and certainly has a negative impact on the potential truthfulness of the speaker

 In view of the popular meaning of the term, they can actually be used illegally and inappropriately as a means of refuting allegations with solid and complete evidence
 isliye aise har upyog kii vaidhata kuch vivaadon kaa vishay hogi
 1996 main maaikel parenti likhe gayi apane niabandh "da jekeef acesination 2: kansperesiphobia on da left", jisamen is shabd ke upyog main pragatisheel media bhoomika kii parakh kii gai he, main likhaa gaya he, Architectural and institutional analysis suggests that the term is misused when it is applied to entities that are acting according to their agreed goals, such as to increase profits when a group of corporations Engages in stabilizing the value

 Michael Paranti gives an example of the use of the term, which seems conflicting in its own use
 ve likhte hai, The term "conspiracy theory" itself is a type of subject of conspiracy theory, which argues that the term is used to manipulate viewers' disregard for the subject of discussion, either to hide the truth As a deliberate attempt or as a deception of a deliberate conspiracy
 jab shadyantr ke siddhanton ko aadhikarik daavon ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he, to unhen aam taur par shadyantr ke siddhant ke rup main vichaar nahin kiya jaataa

 Further difficulties arise from the ambiguity of this term theory

 menaken ne likhaa: The belief in conspiracy theories became a topic of interest to sociologists, psychologists, and folklore experts since at least the 1960s, after the assassination of US President John F
 Kennedy, ultimately based on the facts reported in the Warren Commission report But there was an unprecedented public reaction against the official version of the case
 kuch manovaigyanikon ke anusaar, agar ek vyakti shadyantr ke ek siddhant main vishwaas karata he to dusron main bhi vishwaas karegaa; ek vyakti jo shadyantr ke ek siddhant main vishwaas nahin karata he, to vah duusare par bhi vishwaas nahin karegaa
aisa soochnaaon ke bich matbhedon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, jis par dal apane nishkarsh taiyaar karne main vishwaas karte he
 Psychologists believe that the search for meaning is common in the development of conspiracyism and conspiracy theory, and this alone can be so powerful that one can first construct an idea
 Confirmation bias and avoidance of cognitive dissonance can reinforce confidence once cognition occurs
 ek sandarbh main, jahaan ek sajeesh kaa siddhant ek saamaajik samooh main lokapriy ho gaya he, to sampradayik sudrudheekaran bhi samaan rup se ek bhoomika kaa hissaa ho saktaa he
 Some research done at the University of Kent in the UK suggests that people can be influenced by conspiracy theories without knowing that their eyesight has changed
 vals kii rajkumaari dyna kii maut ke bare main ujagar sajeesh ke kuch lokapriy siddhanton ke adhyayan ke baad iske pratibhaagiyon ne sahi-sahi yah anumaan lagaaya ki unke saathiyon kaa ravaiya kitna badal gaya he, lekin mahatvapurn rup se unhone is baat ko kaaphi kam karke aanka ki shadyantr ke siddhanton ke paksh main unka drushtikon kitna badal gaya he
 The authors concluded that conspiracy theories have 'a hidden power' that affects people
 maanavtaavaadi manovaigyanikon kaa tark he ki bhale hi sajeesh ke peeche ek gupt dal hameshaa se shatrutapurna rukh vaala rahaa he, phir bhi shadyantr ke siddhantkaron ke liye usamen aashwaasan kaa ek tatv hota he, kyonki yah sochna santvanaa pradaan karata he ki maanav se jude maamalon kii jatiltaayen or uthapatak kam se kam maanvon dwaara hi paidaa kii jaati hai, maanav niyantran se baahar ke karkon dwaara nahin
 is tarah ke ek gupt dal khud ko aashwast karne kaa ek upkaran hai ki kuch ghatnaayen yadrichhik nahin hai, lekin maanav buddhi ke dwaara aadeshit hai
 This shows that such incidents are comprehensible and potentially controllable
 agar ek gupt dal ke karnaamon ko ghatnaon ke ek anukram main alipt kiya ja saktaa he, vahaan hameshaa ksheen hi sahi, lekin ummid bandhati he, lekin ek chote gupt samooh kii takat ko kamjor karne ke liye- yaa isamen shaamil hone or khud us shakti kaa prayog karne ke liye
 ant main ek chote gupt samooh kii takat main vishwaas maanav garima kaa nirvivaad abhikthan he- bhale hi avchetan main, lekin aavashyak rup se nishchaypurvak ghoshnaa he ki aadmi bilkul asahaay nahin he, lekin kam se kam kuch maamalon main khud ke bhagya ke liye vah jimmedaar he
 Some historians argue that conspiracyism has an element of psychological projection
 tark ke mutabik, yah prakshepan sajeesh karne waalon ke liye swayan kii visheshtaon ke avaanchhneeya ropan ke rup main prakat hota he
 Richard Hofstadter wrote in his essay - The Paranoid Style in American Politics - that 


 is nishkarsh kaa pratikaar mushkil he ki yah dushman kai maamalon main swayan ke prakshepan kaa virdohi he, adarsh or swayan ko asweekaarya karne ke pahaluon donon ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he
 The enemy may be metropolitan intellectuals, but the paranoid will go beyond that as a tool for their educational achievements

 Spokespersons of various radical anti-communist "warriors" openly express their appreciation for dedication and discipline for communist interests

 It is possible that some basic human knowledge can be focused on materials with theoretical bias tests
 According to one study, humans apply the "rule of Thumb", through which we hope that a significant event has a significant cause
 yah adhyayan vishyon ke liye ghatnaon ke chaar sanskaran pesh karata he, jisamen ek videshi sanghathan pramukh kii safaltaapurvak hatya kar di gai, ghayal hua, lekin batch gaya, ghaav ke baavjood batch gayi, lekin baad kii taarikh main dil ke daure kii mrityu ho gai or puri tarah batch gayi
 In cases of major incidents, the subjects can point to a potentially suspicious conspiracy - in which the head of the organization was killed - then other evidence available to them should be similar compared to other cases
 The genetic tendency of humans to be associated with paridolia is that it tries to find patterns in coincidence and this allows the "discovery" of a conspiracy in an important event
 ek anya ipestemic 'rule of thamb'anya maanvon kii bhagidaari vaale rahasyon par galat rup se lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jo kui bono hoga
 anya logon ke chhipe hue uddeshyon ke liye yah samvedansheeltaa or ek maanav chetana ke saarvbhaumik lakshan ke rup main shaamil ho sakati he
 However, it can be a valid rule of thumb for detectives to use when a list of suspects is being made for investigation
 Experiment as to who has motive, means and opportunity '- is a perfectly valid use of this rule of thumb
 kuch vyaktiyon ke liye sajeesh ke ek siddhant par vishwaas karne, sabit karne yaa yaa phir se bataane kii ek jununee majaburi ho sakati he or yah is baat kaa sanket he ki ek yaa ek se adhik puri tarah samajhi hui manovaigyanik sthiti or anya kaalpanik sthitiyaan : vyamoh, inkaar, ek prakaar kaa paagalpan min world syndrome ho sakati hai
 Christopher Hitchens considers conspiracy theories to be 'the exhaust of the gas of democracy', which is an unavoidable consequence of the large amount of information circulating among the vast majority of people
 anya saamaajik tikaakaron or samajashastriyon kaa kahana he ki shadyantr ke siddhant un vividhtaon se paidaa hote hai, jo ek loktantric samaaj ke bheetar badal sakate he
 Conspiracy incidents can be emotionally satisfying when they are placed in an intuitive and ethical context
 The theory is capable of providing moral responsibility for an emotionally disturbing event for the client or a clearly imagined group of individuals
 mahatvapurn baat he yah ki samooh aastikon ko shaamil nahin karata 
 aastik nidaan ke liye koi naitik yaa raajnneetik daayitv se mukt mahasoos kar saktaa he, bhale hi koi sansthagat yaa saamaajik khami matbhed kaa vaastavik strot ho saktaa he
 Where responsible social behavior is prevented by social situations or is generally beyond a person's ability, conspiracy theory makes the process of emotional liberation or closure easier, where such emotional challenges are needed
 naitik aatank kii tarah shadyantr ke siddhant un samudaayon main baar-baar ubharate hai, jo saamaajik algaav or raajnneetik ni:shashaktikaran kaa anubhav karte hai
 Mark Fenster argues that "just because archaic conspiracy theories are wrong, it does not mean that they cannot do anything wrong
 In particular, they address theoretically real structural injustice, for a shabby civil society
 Give a response and converge towards the ownership of the means of production, which simultaneously recognize the political subject and in the public domain Do without the ability to Ucit
 " 
 Social historian Holgan Harwig first studied Germany's explanation for the root causes of World War: yah saamaanya prakriya kai tarah ke prabhaavon dwaara badali ja sakati he
 Emphasis on psychological needs at the individual level can affect the process and some of our universal mental tools are iptemic 'blind spots'
 ek samooh yaa saamaajik str par aitihaasik kaarak santoshjanak arth nirdisht karne kii prakriya ko kam yaa adhik samasyagrast kar sakate hai
 Alternatively, conspiracy theories may arise when the evidence available in the public record does not coincide with the general or official version of events
 Conspiracy theories in this regard can sometimes uncover blind spots in common or official interpretations of events
 media tikaakar niyamit rup se zyada jatil sanrachanaatmak paksh ke vipareet vyaktigat agenton ke chashme ke jariye ghatnaon ko samajhane kii samachar media or lokapriy samskruti kii pravriti ko note karte hai
 If this observation is true then it is to be expected that the viewer both demands and consumes emphasis on this aspect and is more receptive to the dramatic account of personal and social events for himself
 media kii ek duusari, shaayad sambandhit, alankarik bhashaa main nakaaratmak ghatnaon ke liye vyaktigat jimmedaari tay karne kaa prayaas hota he
 There is a tendency in the media that if an incident happens, it starts searching for the culprits and it is so important that it does not remove it from its news agenda within a few days
 With this trend, it has been said that there is no place in the news for the concept of a pure accident
 Again, if this is a correct observation, it may reflect in that real change in how the media consumer views negative events
 hollywood ke cinema or tivi sho nigamon or sarkaron ke maanak kaamkaaj ke rup main shadyantr main vishwaas ko sthai banaaye rakhane or vistaarit karne main lage rahete hai
 Feature films such as Enemy of the State and Shooters are among the many films that advance conspiracies as a common practice and also abandon the tendency to question conspiracies, which pre-1970 films There was a specialty in the era
 jeenke kii hatya ke sandarbh main shooter isi pranali se kaam karata he, "jaise shadyantr kaam karte hai"
 yah dilachasp he ki filmein or tivi sho muddon ke maanvikaran or naatakeekaran ke sambandh main samachar media kii tarah kaam karata he, jinhen ek shadyantr ke siddhant main shaamil karnaa aasaan hota he
 Coming home turns the return of the wounded soldier of the Vietnam War into a major problem, as there is a chance that the wounded soldier will be trapped in the love trap and when he does so there is a strong conclusion that a big problem solved
 yah pahalu hollywood kii patakatha ke vikaas kaa ek prakritik parinaam he, jo ek yaa do pramukh paatro ko zyada mahatv dete hai, jinka abhinay bade sitare karte hai or is prakaar film ke vipanan kaa ek acha tarika sthapit ho jaataa he, lekin pareekshan ke baad avaidh logon ke chakravyuuh kaa pardaafash ho jaataa he
 This then suspiciously justifies a happy ending, although the audience expects it, but in fact another effect comes in the form of exaggerating the feeling of false and fictional stories, and in fact it It justifies losing public confidence in the statement of mass media
 vishwaas ke nuksaan se jo shunya paidaa hota he, vah shadyantr ke siddhant ke spashtikaran ko dhwast kar detaa he
 The act of dramatizing real or fictional events also nurtures untrue and deliberate efforts at a level which media experts today can easily identify

 Michael Kelly, a Washington Post journalist and critic of both left and right wing anti-war activities, coined the term "paranoia of uniformity" to refer to the political convergence of left and right activists associated with anti-war activities and civil liberties, They are inspired by a shared belief in conspiratorialism or anti-government views

 dainiel pips ne 2004 main jerusalem post main fusion pairanoria naamak lekh likhaa tha : The politically disaffected: Blacks, the hard right, and other alienated elements
 His theories imply a political agenda, but lack much of a following
 The culturally suspicious: These include "kennedy assassinologists," "ufologists," and those who believe a reptilian race runs the earth and alien installations exist under the earth's surface
 Such themes enjoy enormous popularity, but carry no political agenda
 The major new development, reports Barkun, professor of political science in the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, is not just an erosion in the divisions between these two groups, but their joining forces with occultists, individuals bored by rationalism
 Occultists are drawn to what Barkun calls the "cultural dumping ground of the heretical, the scandalous, the unfashionable, and the dangerous" - such as spiritualism, theosophy, alternative medicine, alchemy, and astrology
 Thus, the author who worries about the Secret Service taking orders from the Bavarian Illuminati is old school; the one who worries about a "joint reptilian-bavarian Illuminati" takeover is at the cutting edge of the new synthesis
 These bizarre notions constitute what Michael Kelly termed "fusion paranoia," Conspiracy theories exist in the realm of myth, where imaginations run wild, fears trump facts, and evidence is ignored
 As a superpower, the United States is often cast as a villain in these dramas
 In his two-volume writing - The Open Society and Its Enemies, Popper used the term "conspiracy theory" to refer to criticizing ideologies influenced by fascism, Nazism and communism

 Popper did not argue against the existence of the daily conspiracy
 Popper used the term "conspiracy" to describe Plato's ordinary political activities in Athens

 Fictional conspiracy theories are clean, spontaneous, in which the plotter's plan is well suited to the dramatic needs of the story's structure

 India has a poor literacy rate of 66 percent, ranked 149 in the World Literacy Ranking, with its report given by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2007 and included in the 2009 United Nations Development Program Report
 vastav main, shiksha jo ek sanvaidhanik adhikaar tha shuru main ab ek moulik adhikaar kaa darja praapt he
 The development for the right to education has happened in this way: At the beginning of the Constitution of India, the right to education was recognized under Article 41 of the Directive Principles of State Policy according to which, "rajya apni aarthik kshamta or vikaas kii simaaon ke bheetar, shiksha or berogari, vriddhavastha, beemaari or viklaangata ke maamle main saarvajanik sahaayta karne ke liye kaam karte hai, sahi hasil karne ke liye prabhavi vyavastha karne or naahak ke anya maamalon main chaahate hai "
 The assurance of free and compulsory education was made again under the Principles, under the Directive Article 45 of the State Policy, which runs as follows, "an attempt to provide for the State, within a period of ten years shall be free and compulsory education
 For all children of this constitution from the beginning until they complete the age of fourteen
 " In addition, with providing education, 46 articles also related to schedule castes, schedule tribes and other weaker sections of the society
 The fact that the right to education has been dealt with in article 3 as well as dealt with under Part IV of the Constitution explains how important it has been perceived by the framers of the Constitution
 29 lekh or aalekh shiksha ke adhikaar ke saath 30 samjhaute or ab, ham anuchhed 21A he, jo ek majboot tareeke se aashwaasan ab detaa he
 In 2002, the Constitution Act came to be recognized as a fundamental right through the right to education
 lekh 21A isliye sammilit hona jisamen kaha gaya he aayaa, "rajya rajya ke rup main is tareeke se, vidhi dwaara, nirdhaarit kar sakate main chah se chaudaa varsh kii aayu ke sabhi bacchon ko muft or anivaary shiksha pradaan karegaa

 rajya andhra pradesh kii ki shiksha ko ek moulik adhikaar main laayaa ja rahaa main diya nirnay kiya gaya tha
 Even after this, it involved a lot of struggle to bring about Article 21A and later, the Right to Education Act
 Therefore, a raw draft bill for the RTE Act was proposed in 2005
 bacchon ke adhikaar ko ni: shulk or anivaary shiksha adhinium, lokapriy shiksha kaa adhikaar adhinium ke rup main janaa april, 2010 ke 1 ko prabhaav main aayaa tha
 The RTE Act was passed on 4 August 2009 by the Parliament of India on 2 July 2009 and by the Cabinet Ministry on 20 July 2009, after the approval of the Rajya Sabha on 20 July 2009
 raashtrapati pratibha patil ne is vidheyak ko manjuuri de di he uske or is ke rajptr main ni: shulk bachche ke adhikaar par or anivaary shiksha adhinium ke rup main adhishuchet kiya gaya sitambar, 2009 3

 Thus, in the end a very important right is an important right that is how it took shape after recovery from the situation
 shiksha kaa adhikaar 86 of the Constitution was added by Amendment Act 2002 which provides that the State shall by law make it mandatory for free education compulsory for all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years

 aisa kyon he? isliye ki ham sabhi main kuch na kuch "bimaavigya" kaa ansh vidyaman he
 In a day, perhaps one in 25 thousand human beings turn up to die, so it is natural that everyone considers himself in 24,999
 is hisaab se kah sakate hai ki ek manushya ko agle choubees ghanton main mrityu kii sambhaavna 25 hajaar main ek, yaa 1 / 25000 = 0
 xxrep 4 0 4, baar he or choubees ghante jivit rahane kii sambhaavna 0

 Suppose Sanai is a 20-year-old healthy young man
 uske vyavsaay, vanshaparampara, rahan sahan aadi sab kaa vichaar kar beemaa vijna ne yah nishchit kiya ki ek varsh main sanai jaise ek hajaar vyaktiyon main se do ke marane kii aashaa he, to ham kahenge ki matryata kii vaarshik dar hajaar main do, athwa 0

 usamen bimaakrit vastu kaa mulya hota he, kintu jivan kaa mulya nahin hota
 Life insurance cannot be guaranteed
 jivan lautaaya nahin ja saktaa
 The financial loss to the dependents can be reduced or reduced by the death of the earning person with insurance
 yahi kaam prayek jivan beemaa yojana karti he
 Even if Sanai dies after three months of getting insurance, his dependents will get full insurance money
 bimaavigya jaanate hai ki thode se logon kaa beemaa karne se bhavishyavaanee ke ankon or vaastavik ankon main antar adhik ho saktaa he, par bade paimaane par beemaa karne se bhavishyavaanee adhik sahi utarati he

 saath hi bimaavigya yah bhi jaanate hai ki aswasth manushya adhik sugamawa se beemaa karaane ko taiyaar ho jate hai tathaa is prakaar ke hi log sugamawa se badi rakamon kaa beemaa prastaav karte hai
 Therefore, they take special care in relation to insurance proposals of large amount and older people and also recommend proper medical examination
 bade paimaane par bime kaa kaam karne se bimaakrit jansamooh se bahut badi dhanrashi aati he
 With such a large amount of money, good interest can be earned

 Such a large amount of money is a great service to the nation

 Also, private businesses also receive capital from the above mentioned funds

 There is also a huge expenditure in its management
 bimaavigya matryata, bhavishya main kamaaya janevaala byaaj or honevaali aay tathaa bime ke liye aavashyak sanghathan par honevaale vyay aadi par dhyaan rakhte hai
 All these cannot be determined exactly in advance, yet looking at the past, present and the condition of society, etc
, one guesses as much as possible
 inhen sab baton par vichaarkar beemaa kist nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 The financial condition of an insurance institution cannot be estimated by looking at the total amount of money
 jo shulk bimaakrit vyaktiyon se praapt hota rahata he, uskaa adhikansh unhen yaa unke ashriton ko kai varshon baad beemaa dhan ke rup main lautaaya jaataa he
 a new insurance institution or a fast-growing insurance institution will have a huge amount of money even if the financial condition is poor, so if the insurer does not have a check on the institution as a valuation, the managers may be tempted to loot the increasing amount
 is
 isliye bimaavigya ko samay samay par jivanankik moolyankan karnaa padataa he
 Mathematics qualification must be very good to become an insurance specialist

 The general information about the school is as follows: - varun hindu dharm ke ek pramukh devtaa hai
 His place in the ancient Vedic religion was very important, but his form in the Vedas is so abstract that its natural depiction is difficult
 mana jaataa he ki varun kii sthiti anya vaidic devataaon kii apeksha pracheen he, isiilie vaidic yug main varun kisi prakritik upadan kaa vaachak nahin he
 The amount of hymns addressed to Varuna is much less than that of Agni and Indra, yet its importance is not less
 indra ko mahaan yoddha ke rup main janaa jaataa he to varun ko naitik shakti kaa mahaan poshak mana gaya he, vah rut kaa poshak he
 There is a feeling of sublime devotion towards Vasana in most of the Suktas
 rugveda ke adhiktar sookhton main varun se kiye gaye paapon ke liye kshamaa prarthana kii gai hai
 Varuna is also described along with other deities such as Indra etc
 varun se sambandhit prarthanaaon main bhakthi bhaavana kii paraakaashtha dikhaai detii he
 For example, in the seventh mandala of the Rigveda, beautiful prayer songs are found for Vasana
 unako "asur" kii upadhi di gayi thi, matlab kii wo "dev" devataaon ke samooh se alag the
 He was considered to have magical power, whose name was Maya
 unako itihaaskaar maanate hai ki asur varun hi parsi dharm main "ahura mazda" kehalaae
 In later mythology, Varuna was made a minor water god

 Nihilism or nothingness is the doctrine or doctrine of the department called Madhyamah, the Mahayana branch of Buddhists, in which the world is considered void and all its substances as powerless
 "madhyamik nyaay" ne "shoonyavad" ko darshanik siddhant ke rup main angeekrut kiya he
 According to this, both the known and the knowledge are imaginary
 parmaarthik tatv ekmaatr "shunya" hi he
 The "zero" essence is different from these four categories, asat, samsat and samsadvilakasana
 jagat is "shunya" kaa hi vivart he
 The root of Vivarta is Vavruti, which is also known as Avidya and Lust
 is mat ke anusaar karmkleshon kii nivritti hone par manushya nirvana praapt kar usee prakaar shant ho jaataa he jaise tel or batti samaapt hone par pradeep
 In Nagarjuna's view, the basic element is nothing other than zero
 dhyaan dene kii baat yah he ki yah shunya koi nishedhaatmak vastu nahin he jiskaa aplaap kiya ja sake
 It is possible to use only four categories in the design of any substance - parmarth in chaaron kotiyon se mukt hota he or isiilie uske abhidhaan ke liye "shunya" shabd kaa prayog ham karte hai
 In the words of Nagarjuna shoonyavad kii siddhi ke liye nagarjun ne vidhvansaatmak tark kaa upyog kiya he - vah tark, jiske sahare padaarth kaa vishleshan karte karte vah keval shunyarup main tik jaataa he
 On the strength of this argument, Nagarjuna has the credit for making a very serious, touching and original discussion of elements like matter, speed, caste, time, connection, soul, etc
 is mat main satya do prakaar kaa hota he - The first of which indicates practical power arising out of avidya; The second wisdom is the exponent of truth generated
 "sanvruti" shabd kaa arth he avidya
 Being indistinguishable, practical truth is known as communicative truth
 satya kii yah dwividh vyakhya nagarjun kii drushti main shoonyavad ke dwaara udbhavit nutan kalpana nahin he, pratyut buddha ke dwaara hi pracheen kaal main sanketit kii gai he
 Some of Buddha's teachings are given on the basis of practical truths; Other sermons are postponed above the orthodox truth
 abhisht donon he buddha ko - Nagarjuna, despite being a philosopher, was not a teacher who ignored behavior
 ve jaanate hai ki vyavhaar kaa bina aashray liye parmarth kaa upadesh hi nahin ho saktaa or parmarth kii prapti ke abhaav main nirvana mil nahin saktaa
 The intellect of ordinary human beings is so obsessed with behavior that behavior cannot be practiced to bring it to the altar
 falat: vyavhaar kii asatyata parmarth shabdon ke dwaara pratipaadya vastu nahin he
 That is why he is known by the designation of "illiteracy"
 parmarthatatv buddhivyapaar itani aasakt he ki use parmarth path par laane ke liye vyavhaar kaa aplaap nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As a result, by showing "untruth" of behavior, a seeker has to be distinguished in charity
 parmarth shabdon ke dwaara pratipaadya vastu nahin he
 That is why we know him by designation of the non-literal element
 parmarthatatv buddhivyapaar se agochar, avishay, sarvaprapanchanirmukt tathaa kalpanavirahit he, parantu uske upar jaagtik padaarthon kaa samarope karne se hi uskaa gyaan hamen ho saktaa he
 This element bears a similar resemblance to the supervention and exception of Vedantis

 Frictionless metals and mishratu are metals and mishratu that help to reduce the coefficient of friction between two machine-parts that rotate and are also reduced due to friction
 ghoomanevaalon chakkon athwa pahiyon ke abaadh gati se chalate rahane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki jis dhuree par ve ghumte hai, vah ghiskar patali na hone paae or na garam hi ho sake
 Lubricants have generally been used to avoid this difficulty, but using only lubricants for fast moving machines proves to be unsuccessful in preventing wear and tear
 isi prakaar jab kisi mashin kaa ek bhaag uske duusare bhaag par baraabar ghumta he, tab vahaan bhi ragad tathaa ghisaai se bachane kaa upaay aavashyak hota he
 For this measure, concrete is made from some special metals of the shape of ball or cylinder at the points of machines and wheels where the effect of grinding and rubbing is effected
 ye us mashin athwa chakke ke ghoomane ke saath-saath swayan bhi apni jagah par ghoomte rahete hai
 They have full pressure on the wear of the machine

 These bearings are placed in a strong groove or placenta made of metal, in which even when moving around, they should not be able to move from their fixed position
 bering banane ke liye vishesh dhaatu evam mishradhaatuon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo gati se ghoomte rahane par bhi gharshan evam taap ke kaaran na to ghisne paati hai or na dabaav padane par tut hi paati hai
 The use of hard metals is not always useful to minimize wear to the effect of friction, because heat is produced quickly when hard metals are rubbed and on the part of the machine running on such hard metal bearings
 , Reads harmful effects of wear

 As the speed of machines increases, new types of bearings metals and alloys are invented
 kisi vishesh gati evam mashin ke upyukt hi bering dhaatuon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he
 For this, metals like Vung, Lead, Copper, Iron, Antimony, Zinc, Arsenic, Bismuth, Cadmium, Nickel, Silver and Phosphorus are used in more quantity in making alloys
 neeche kuch aisi mahatvapurn mishradhatuen di gai hai, jinka prayog agharshneey dhaatu ke rup main bade paimaane par hota he : Vung, copper and antimony alloys have been used for making bearings for the last more than a century
