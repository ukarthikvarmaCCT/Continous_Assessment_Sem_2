vaastavik ingine main idhan-vaayu-mishran ko ghataane badhaanevaale yantra se, jise prarodh kehete hai, tathaa antargrahan or nikaas vaalvon se mishran kii gati main kuch baadha padati he
 Therefore, while sucking the mixture, the pressure in the cylinder is less than the atmospheric pressure
 falat: utana mishran nahin ghus paata jitna saidhantik gananaa main mana jaataa he
 In theoretical calculations it is assumed that the pressure of the mixture within the cylinder is equal to the atmospheric pressure
 phir, silinder kaa bhitari prishth, tathaa mishranpurna apekshaakrit tapt rahete hai
 Therefore, on reaching the cylinder, the fuel mixture gets heated
 aaytan taap-daab niyam ke anusaar taap badhane ke kaaran silinder main mishran kaa dravyaman us dravyaman kii apeksha kam hota he jo thande rahane par hota
 Then, in the actual engine's cylinder space, even after the exhaust ambush is complete, the gases remain at higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure, and they spread to the cylinder at the start of the suction power
 inkaa daab vayumandaleey daab ke baraabar ho jane ke baad hi chushan kaa aarambh hota he
 Also, less than a calculated amount of theory, the mixture enters the cylinder
 ant main, ingine samudratal se jitani hi adhik oonchaai par kaam karegaa vahaan vayumandaleey daab utani hi kam hogi
 Therefore, according to mass, the amount of mixture that can enter the cylinder at sea level is less than the mixture will be able to enter the high places
 antardahan ingine kii aaytneey dakshata keval oonchaai badhane par hi nahin ghatati, vah ingine kii chaal badhane par bhi ghatati he
 Therefore, the supercharger is often installed in the engines used in the race competition and at high altitude engines
 is yantra main ek chota sa apkendriya pankhaa rahata he jo idhan-vaayu-mishran ko silinder main vayumandaleey daab ke kuch adhik daab par thuns detaa he
 Applying a supercharger increases the rectangular efficiency, even it can exceed 1
 oto chakra ke vishleshan main yah dikhaaya ja chukaa he ki sampeden anupaat badhaane se dakshata badhati he
 The same trend appears in real engines
 oto chakra ke anusaar kaam karanevaale injanon main chushan aghat main vaayu ke saath hi idhan bhi ghusata he or isliye sampeden aghat main bhi vah vartmaan rahata he
 When the compression ratio is kept too large, the fuel mixture explodes as soon as the compression exceeds a certain amount, that is, the fuel itself, ignites without sparking from the spark plug
 phir, yadi aisa na bhi hua, to spark plag kii chinagaari se jalanaa aarambh hone par sampeden lehren uthati hai, jo chinagaari ke paas jalte hue mishran ke aage aage chalati hai
 Due to these compression waves, the mixture away from the spark may itself burn, which is undesirable
 phir, silinder main kahin petrol aadi ke jaale avshesh ke dahakate rahane se, athwa piston ke bheetar bade petrol aadi ke jaale avshesh ke dahakate rahane se, athwa piston ke bheetar bade kisi avyav kii tapt nok se bhi idhan mishran samay ke pehle jal saktaa he
 Whenever the compressed mixture burns prematurely, its burning is explosive
 yah kaan se sunai padataa he - jaan padataa he ki kisi dhaatu ko hathode se thonka ja rahaa he
 Fear of explosions is more common in quick-burning fuels
 pichhali kuch dashabdiyon main kai naveen khojein hui hai, jinase bina adhisphot hue sampeden anupaat adhik bada rakhaa ja saktaa he
 For example san 1920-25 ke lagbhag motorcar ke injanon main sampeden anupaat lagbhag 4
5 rahata tha; kabhi-kabhi to yah 3
5 hi rahata tha
 At present the ratio is 6
5 or more; In some engines, this ratio is up to 10
 injanon kii twara saadhaarant: chakkar prati minute main bataai jaati he parantu yah nirdhaarit nahin he ki kitne chakkar prati minute rahane par ingine ko inamen se kis vishesh varg main rakhaa jaae
 Additionally, the number of revolutions per minute in a high-speed steam engine is 4,000 or slightly faster per minute for a very slow inertial engine, but in engines designed for race competition, the rounds are around 6,000 per minute
 ve deazal ingine, jinamein chakkar prati minute lagbhag 1,000 hote hai teevrgati deazal kehalaate hai
 Larger size cylinders run slower than engines with smaller cylinders, because larger pistons are heavier and tend to be so jerky that they are harder to handle when changing direction of movement
 piston kaa veg bhi injanon kii gati kii seemaa nirdhaarit karata he, kyonki piston kaa veg bahut badhaane se ingine ghiskar sheeghra nasht ho jaataa he
 In motorcar engines, piston-velocity is now maintained at 2,800 feet per minute or even more
 deazal injanon main piston kaa ausat veg 1,000 or 1,200 foot prati minute ke bich rahata he
 The size of the engines is determined by the diameter of the cylinder and the race of the piston
 udaharant:, 12-18 inch ke ingine kaa arth yah he ki silinder kaa vyas 12 inch he or piston kii daud 18 inch he
 Modern motorcar engines have much more power than their predecessors 20-30 years ago

 a small boy named Altaf is the only family member who survives the shootout
 inayat kii patni nilimaa, altaaf ke liye khed karti he or altaaf ko apnaane ke liye inayat ko raji karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Khan reluctantly agrees as he repents for killing Altaf's family
 altaaf apane nae ghar main bas jaataa he or inayat or nilimaa ko apane nae mata-pita ke rup main sweekaar kar letaa he
 He then learns that Inayat was one of the policemen who killed his family
 vah usko maarane kii koshish karata he or asafal hone par bhaag jaataa he
 He is found by a terrorist group led by his Pathan leader Hilal Kohtistan and trained to become a terrorist

 This text has such a deep influence in the Buddhist Sangha that no monk in Lanka is provided a subcontinent without being successful in it
 'dhammapad kaa vyutpattigat arth he dharmavishyak koi shabd, pankti yaa padyatmak vachan'
 It is said in the book itself - The only such word, Gathapad and Dhammapada is more creditable than the translation of thousands of gharanas with disastrous verses, which can be subdued by listening
 buddha sadhu praaia: isi granth kii kisi gaatha yaa uske anshmaatr kaa aadhaar lekar apana pravachan aarambh karte hai, jis prakaar isai padri bible ke kisi vachan se
 In this work, they get great help from the commentary called Dhammapada's Atthakatha, in which apart from the specific meaning of each saga, one and many stories are given in its illustrative form
 yah attakatha buddhaghosh yaa unke kaalvarti kisi anya acharya dwaara tripitak main se hi sangruhit kii gai hai
 The story of Vasvadatta and Udayan has also come in it

 The treatise mentions Buddhist philosophy, true Trisharan, four Aryasatya and Ashtangic path, but in it there are some clear views on such things as soul, nirvana, rebirth, virtue-sin or heaven hell, etc
, in relation to the various sects of Buddhism itself
 There is a difference in yahan swayan bhagwaan buddha kehete hai, "main anek janmon rup sansar main lagaataar dauda or us grihakaarak sharir ke nirmaataa ko dhundta phiraa, kyonki yah baar-baar kaa janmamaran du:khadaayi he

 "some sinners are born from the womb in human or animal life, some are hell and some go to heaven by good faith, and those who are not alive get to Parinirvana

 Here, there is no doubt in the acceptance of the vagina, hell, heaven and liberation of these movements and the imperative of the work

 Hence this book is named "prakrit Dhammapada"
 isamen 12 vagga or 251 gaathaayen hai
 The third passage of the Sanskrit Mahavastu edited by Senart quotes 24 verses from the dhammapada-sahasvasvagraha
 jabaki pali tripitak ke sahassavagg main kul 16 gaathaayen hi hai
 From this it appears that there was a Sanskrit phraseology in front of the Karta of Mahavastu in which the number of verses was more than that of Pali Dhammapada
 chini bhashaa main dhammapad ke chaar anuwaad milte hai, jinamein se ek main 500, duusare main 700, tisare main 900 or chauthe main lagbhag 1000 gaathaon kaa anuwaad he or unki atthakathaayen pai jaati hai
 The creation of the first three of these is attested between the fourth century and fourth centuries of the fourth century of Christ

 By mixing the above two forms of Pali and Prakrit in these four, at least six versions of Dhammapada come to our confluence, which was preached by BC
 From the 18th century onwards, it is found in the countries of Lanka, Syam, Burma, Central Asia and China

 The effective behavior of an organ, or the continuing decrease in the behavior of that organ, is protected by heredity, and these things are incarnated in the organisms that originate from these organisms, but the condition is that the acquired changes occur in both males and females, Or in the male and female from which new organisms have originated
 lamark ko vishwaas tha ki jivit jeevon ke spishiz main yaa to prakritik shrunkhlaa rahati he yaa antar rahata he
 The idea of the continuity of living beings led him to think that the life and vegetation category must be born at some point and he insisted that the living beings should be studied in a holistic way

 The Rigveda does not mention the rites, but in some verses of this book some religious acts related to marriage, conception and funerals are found
 yajurveda main keval shrout yagyon kaa ullekh he, isliye is granth ke sanskaron kii vishesh jaankaree nahin milti
 In the Atharvaveda, more elaborate descriptions of marriage, funerals and conception rites are found

 At the end of education in the Taittiriya Upanishad, the convocation of Acharya is found
 is prakaar grihyasutron se purv hamen sanskaron ke puure niyam nahin milte
 It seems that rites were performed on the basis of traditional practices before Grihasuutras
 sabase pehle grihasutron main hi sanskaron kii puri paddati kaa varnan miltaa he
 In the description of the rites in the Grihyasutras, marriage rites are first mentioned
 iske baad garbhaadhan, punswan, simantonnayan, jaat- karm, namakaran, nishkraman, ann- prashan, chuda- karm, upanayan or samaavartan sanskaron kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The description of funeral rites is not found in most householders, as it was considered inauspicious to do so
 smritiyon ke aachaar prakarnon main sanskaron kaa ullekh he or tatsambandhi niyam die gaye hai
 These describe in detail the Upanayana and marriage rites, as the person entered the Brahmacharya ashram through the Upanayana rites and the Grihastha ashram through the marriage rites
 sanskaar kaa abhipraay un dharmik krityon se tha jo kisi vyakti ko apane samudaay kaa purna rup se yogya sadsy banane ke uddeshy se uske sharir, man or mastishk ko pavitra karne ke liye kiye jate the, kintu hindu sanskaron kaa uddeshy vyakti main abhisht gunon ko janm dena bhi tha
 The use of the word "sanskar" is not found in Vedic literature
 sanskaron kaa vivechan mukhya rup se grihyasutron main hi miltaa he, kintu inamen bhi sanskaar shabd kaa prayog yajna saamagree ke pavitrikaran ke arth main kiya gaya he
 The Vaikhanas Smriti Sutra is the first to find a clear distinction between bodily rites and yajnas
 manu or yajyavlky ke anusaar sanskaron se dwijon ke garbh or beej ke doshaadi kii shuddhi hoti he
 Kumaril reveals some different views of it in the Tantravartik treatise
 unke anusaar manushya do prakaar se yogya banataa he - purv- karm ke dosha ko dur karne se or nae gunon ke utpaadan se
 Both of these rituals work
 is prakaar pracheen bharat main sanskaron kaa manushya ke jivan main vishesh mahatv tha
 Through the rites, man developed his natural instincts and took welfare of both himself and the society
 ye sanskaar is jivan main hi manushya ko pavitra nahin karte the, uske parloukik jivan ko bhi pavitra banaate the
 Home was performed before each rite, but according to the Griसूasutra which the person followed, the number of sacrifices, the use of hymns and mantras differed among different families

 But most theology has not mentioned the four Vratas of the Vedas, the Pancha Dainik Mahayagya, the seven Pakyagyas, the seven Haviryagyas and the seven Somayagyas in the rites
 manu ne garbhaadhan, punswan, simantonnayan, jatakarm, namakaran, nishkraman, annaprashan, chudakarm, upanayan, keshant, samaavartan, vivaah or shmashaan, in teraa sanskaron kaa ullekh kiya he
 Yajnavalkya has also described these rites
 keval keshant kaa varnan usamen nahin miltaa he, kyonki is kaal tak vaidic granthon ke adhyayan kaa prachlan band ho gaya tha
 Later rituals give sixteen the number of sacraments, but the Gautam Dharmasutra and the Grihyasutras do not mention the funeral rites, as it was considered inauspicious to describe the funeral rites
 swami dayanand saraswati ne apni sanskaar vidhi tathaa pandit bhimsen sharma ne apni shodash sanskaar vidhi main solah sanskaron kaa hi varnan kiya he
 Both these authors have included funerals in sixteen rites
 garbhavastha main garbhaadhan, punswan or simantonnayan teen sanskaar hote hai
 The purpose of these three is to make the life-style of the parents such that the child is born with good values

 If the food is divided into small particles, it is more likely to be fully digested in the small intestine, and churning in the stomach is helpful in the process of division of food started in the mouth
 jugalee karne vaale chatushpadi praani jo reshedaar padaarthon ko pachaa sakate hai, ve agrodar or jugalee kaa upyog karke is vibhaajan ko or aage badhaate hai
 Rabbits and some other animals pass through their digestive system twice
 adhiktar pakshi chote kankad khaakar apni peshni main hone vaali yantrikeey prakriya main sahaayta karte hai
 The food enters the abdomen from the ventral heart where it is further broken down into smaller particles and mixed well with gastric acid, pepsin, and other digestive enzymes for protein breakdown
 udar ke anzimon kaa ek anukultam bindu bhi hota he, arthath ve kisi khaas piech or taapmaana par sabase behta kaary karte hai
 The acid itself does not convert food into powder, it only provides the optimum ph for the action of the pepsin enzyme and destroys the micro-organisms ingested with the food

 a large part of the digestion and absorption processes take place here after the milk chime enters the digestive system
 yahaan use teen alag alag dravon se milaayaa jaataa he: When the ph level in the small intestine changes and gradually becomes coaxial, more enzymes are activated that chemically break down various nutrients into smaller molecules to absorb into the vascular or lymphatic systems
 To go Small, finger-like structures called villi, each surrounded by even smaller, hair-like structures called microvilli, improve nutrient absorption by increasing the surface area of the intestine and increasing the speed of nutrient absorption
 avashoshit poshak tatwon se bharaa rakt hepatic portal shira se hokar choti aant se baahar le jaaya jaataa he or yakrut main pahunchaaya jaataa he jahaan use chaanaa jaataa he, usamen se toxin nikaale jate hai or poshak tatwon ko sansaadhit kiya jaataa he
 The remaining part of the small intestine and digestive system are peristalsis, by which food is transported from the abdomen to the rectum and the food is absorbed by the digestive juices
 vrittakar or lambavat mansapeshiyaan paraspar virdohi hoti he, jab ek sikudti he to duusari shithil ho jaati he
 When the circular muscles shrink, the cotter becomes more narrower and longer, pushing the food forward

 Digestion in the large intestine lasts for such a period that the bacteria in the alimentary tract can act and ferment, dividing some of the remaining material in the small intestine despite the resource
 vibhaajan ke kuch utpaada avashoshit kar liye jate hai
 In humans, these substances include the most complex saccharides
 iske alaava, kai prishthvanshiyon main badi aant drav ko punah avashoshit kar leti he; registani jeevanstyli vaale kuch prishthvanshiyon main is punarshoshan ke kaaran satat astitv sambhav hota he
 In humans, the large intestine is about 1
5 meters long and has three parts: the cecum, colon and rectum located at the point meeting the small intestine
 The colon also has four parts: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon
 The large intestine absorbs water from the grass and keeps the stool stored until it is removed
 Dietary products that cannot pass through the villi, such as cellulose, are added to other body waste and become hard and concentrated
 yah mel ek nishchit avadhi ke liye malashay main rahata he or phir akunchan or shithilan ke kaaran guda dwaar ke zarie sharir se nikaal diya jaataa he
 The release of this waste material is controlled by the shrinking muscle of the anus

 For example, in recent years several relationships to metabolic or metabolic control have been discovered
 pachan ek jatil prakriya he jo kai karkon dwaara niyantrit kii jaati he
 The ph plays an important role in a normally functioning digestive tube
 mukh, galkosh or grass nalee main piech saamanytah 6
8 hota he, jo ki atyant ksheen amleey he
 Saliva in this area of the digestive tube controls ph
 laar main salivery emilez hota he or yah carbohydrate kaa monosacarids main vibhaajan aarambh karata he
 Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to ph and will not function in a low ph environment, such as in the abdomen
 a ph less than 7 indicates acidification, while a ph greater than 7 indicates alkali; However, the concentration of acid or alkali also has a role
 udar main piech atyadhik amleey hota he or vahaan hone ke dauraan carbohydrate ke vibhaajan ko avarodhit karata he
 These acute acidic substances of the stomach have two benefits, denaturing proteins to further promote digestive function in the small intestine, as well as providing non-specific immunity, slowing or destroying various germs
 choti aant main pachak kinvakon ko sakriy karne ke liye pachanantra mahatvapurn santulan pradaan karata he
 The liver secretes bile in the digestive system to neutralize the acidic state of the stomach
 saath hi agnyashay vahini pachanantra main khaali hoti he or bicarbonate mila kar amleey kim ko nishprabhavi karti he or is prakaar ek udasin parivesh kaa nirmaan karti he
 The mucous tissue of the small intestine is alkaline, forming a ph of about 8
5 and thus enabling absorption in the dim alkaline environment

 Conversion is the act of adopting a new religion, which is different from the previous religion of the person being converted
 Transformation from one denomination of the same religion to another is commonly called reintegration rather than conversion
 anek kaarnon se log vibhinn dharmon main dharmantarit hote hai, jinamein vishwaas main hue parivartan ke kaaran swechha se hone vaala sakriy dharmantaran, dwitiyak dharmantaran, mrityu-shaiyya par hone vaala dharmantaran, kisi laabh ke liye kiya jane vaala tathaa vaivaahik dharmantaran evam balpurvak kiya jane vaala dharmantaran shaamil hai
 Christians believe that conversion requires imbibing a new belief system
 isamen dharmantarit vyakti kii swayan kii pahchaan ke liye ek sandarbh bindu nihit hota he or yah us dharm tathaa sambhddhata donon ke vishwaas tathaa saamaajik sanrachana kaa maamla he
 Typically it requires a new belief system to be accepted sincerely, but it may also present itself in other ways, such as joining an identity group or spiritual lineage
 apane laabh ke liye kiya jane vaala dharmantaran yaa punarsambhddhata ek pakhand he, jo kabhi-kabhi apekshaakrit maamuli kaarnon se kiya jaataa he, jaise kisi abhibhavak dwaara apane bachche kaa dharmantaran karwaanaa taaki vah kisi vishisht dharm se jude kisi achche vidhyalay main pravesh paa sake, athwa kisi vyakti dwaara isaliye dharmantaran kiya janaa, taaki vah us saamaajik varg main shaamil ho sake, jisamen shaamil hone kii vah ichha rakhata he
 Even when people marry, either of the husband or wife can convert to the religion of their spouse
 balpurvak hone vaale dharmantaran main kisi jabardastee ke tahat duusare dharm ko apanaaya jaataa he
 It is possible that in this situation the converted person secretly maintains his former religious belief and, secretly, continues to follow the practices of his original religion to show the new religion outwardly
 It may be that a family that has been forcibly converted has adopted a new religion with a sincere heart after a few generations have passed
 anunay ke dwaara kisi duusare dharm ya vishwaas pranali vaale vyakti ko dharmantarit karne kaa prayaas dharm-parivartan kehalaata he
 Dharmachyut is a blasphemous term used by members of a religion or religious branch to refer to a person who has renounced that religion or branch

 Potential converts should have a spontaneous desire to adopt Judaism and should not have any other purpose

 Some Jews are also descendants of people outside the Mediterranean world who converted to Judaism
 yah gyaat he ki pehle kuch kazar, adomite, ithiopian or saath hi anek arab, vishisht rup se yeman main, ateet main yahudee dharm main dharmantarit hue the; aaj puri duniya main log yahudee dharm main dharmantarit hote hai
 Originally the term "newlywed" was used to refer to a Greek man who converted to Judaism
 chhathin sadi tak bhi purvi roman samrajya yahudee dharm main dharmantaran ke viruddh aadesh jari karata rahaa tha, jisase spasht he ki yah kaary us samay bhi ho rahaa tha
 In recent times, members of the Reform Judaism movement initiated a program to convert non-jewish spouses of non-jewish spouses and non-jews interested in Judaism to inter-religious marriages
 Their reasoning is that so many Jews were killed during the genocide of the Jews that now it has become mandatory to find and welcome newcomers
 orthodox va conzarvative yahudiyon dwaara is paddati ko avastavik tathaa khatarnaak kahkar asweekaar kar diya gaya he
 He says that through these efforts Judaism appears simple to adopt and follow, while the reality is that Judaism requires many difficulties and sacrifices
 isaiyat main hone vaala dharmantaran kisi purv gaiyr-isai vyakti kaa isaiyat ke kisi rup main hone vaala dharmik parivartan he
 Its exact requirements vary according to different churches and denominations
 mukhyatah isamen paap kii sweekaarokti or praayshchitt tathaa isa messiah main vishwaas ke dwaara ek aisa jivan jeene kaa nirnay shaamil hota he, jo ishwar ko sweekaarya ho tathaa pavitra ho
 yah sab sambandhit vyakti kii ichha se kiya jaataa he or ek sachche dharmantaran ke liye vishisht aavashyaktaa he
 Thus, naturally true conversion of someone cannot be done by force
 As far as Christian faith is concerned, forced conversion is a contradiction because true conversion can never be imposed on any human being
 The converts are almost always expected to be baptized
 catholic, orthodox va anek protestant sampradaay bacchon main apni avasthaa kii samaj viksit hone se purv hi navjaat baptism kiye jane ko protsaahit karte hai
 In Roman Catholicism and some high-church forms of Protestantism, baptized children are expected to attend confirmation classes in pre-adolescence
 The Eastern Orthodoxy method, immediately after baptism, is performed on all converts with an equivalent equivalent of confirmation, which applies equally to both adults and newborns
 baptism kii vidhiyon main nimajjan, chhidkaav tathaa bauchhaar shaamil hai
 The baptism received by adults or young people who have reached the age of discernment and are able to make their own person's religious decisions is referred to as the believer's baptism in Conservative and Evangelical Protestant groups
 yah vyakti ke isai banane ke purv nirnay kii ek saarvajanik ghoshnaa ke rup main hona abhisht he
 Some Christian groups, such as Catholics, Churches of Christ and Christadelphians, believe that baptism is necessary for salvation
 dharmantaran se keval dharmik pahchaan main hone vaala ek saral parivartan hi nahin, balki mulyon main parivartan ke dwaara swabhaav main parivartan hona apekshit he
 The Latin word covariano, when translated from the Greek word metanoia, literally means "to go the other way" or "to change your mind"
 isaiyat ke anusaar, ek dharmantarit vyakti vah he, jo apane paap ko vyarth maanakar uskaa tyaag kar detaa he or iske bajaay isa messiah ke param mahatv ko sambhalakar rakhata he; dharmantarit vyakti isa messiah kii tyaagmayi mrityu va punarutthan main isa ke mahatv ko dekhtaa he or paap kaa parityag karata he
 The Christian convert is expected to believe that his separation from God cannot be won by good deeds done by the desire to attain personal moral self-satisfaction; Instead, he should try to obtain forgiveness for his sins in the blood of Jesus and cover his desires with the righteousness of Jesus
 Since conversion is a change in values that embraces God and rejects sin, it includes a personal approach to a life of holiness described by Paul of Tarsus and exemplified by Jesus Christ
 Commitment is included
 kuch protestant paramparaon main, ise "isa ko vyakti ke uddharkarta ke rup main sweekaar karnaa tathaa use apana rakshak maanakar uskaa anusaran karnaa” kaha jaataa he
 In another version, the 1910 Catholic Dictionary "converts" from "a state of sin to a state of repentance, from apostasy to a more true and serious way of life, from unbelief to faith, from hypocrisy to true religion, or Defined as "converting work"
 dharmantaran kii purvi orthodox samaj baptism kii rasm main dikhaai detii he, jisamen dharmantarit vyakti saarvajanik rup se apane paapon kaa praayshchitt karte samay pashchim disha kii ore munh karke khadaa hota he tathaa pratikatmak rup se shaitan par thukta he or iske baad “raja va ishwar ke rup main” isa kii aradhana karne ke liye purv kii ore mudata he
 Most Christians believe that conversion, which is understood as sharing the sermon in the words and deeds of Christ, is the responsibility of every Christian
 naye qaraar ke anusaar, isa ne apane shishyon ko “sabhi rashtron main jane va shishy banane” kaa aadesh diya tha, jise saamanytah great kamishan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Accordingly, evangelism — "preaching the gospel" —has been practiced by many Christians
 kuch prachaarvaadi protestant maanate hai ki great kamishan kii purti ke liye, prayek isai ko anivaary rup se apane sampark main aane vaale lagbhag prayek vyakti ko dharmantarit karne ke prayaas ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chaiye
 isiyat ke anya rup, jaise roman catholikawaad tathaa purvi orthodoxi, maanate hai ki dharmopadesh kii vyakhya achook or vishwaspurn tareeke se nahin kii ja sakati, iske bajaay ve udhaaharan ke dwaara prachaarwaad kaa samarthan karte hai
 a transfer from one Christian denomination to another may involve a relatively simple transfer of membership, especially if moving from one Trinityist sect to another and if the person has been baptized in the name of Trinity
 If not, the person may need to be baptized or re-baptized by the new church
 kuch sampradaayon, jaise anabeptist parampara ko maanane waalon, main pehle baptism le chuke isaayiyon kaa punarbaptism aavashyak hota he
 The Eastern Orthodox Church considers the transfer of Orthodoxy from any other sect of Christianity to be a category of conversion and atonement, although not always a re-baptism
 isiyat main dharmantaran kii prakriya main isai sampradaayon ke bich kuch antar hote hai
 Most Protestants believe in conversion by faith to attain salvation
 is samaj ke anusaar, vyakti apane rakshak ke rup main isa messiah ke prati vishwaas kii ghoshnaa karata he
 Although a person can take this decision privately, it is usually necessary to be baptized and become a member of a denomination or church
 in paramparaon main, isaiyat ke in buniyadi siddhanton, ki isa messiah kii mrityu hui thi, unhen dafnaaya gaya tha or paap ko kshamaa karne ke liye ve punerjeevit hue the, ko saarvajanik rup se sweekaar karne par vyakti ko isai mana jaataa he
 This table summarizes the traditional view of three different Protestant beliefs
 ek nav-dharmantarit muslim ko mullahf kaha jaataa he
 There are five pillars, or bases, of Islam, but the main and most important of these is to believe that there is only one God and Creator, whom Allah calls and that the Islamic Prophet, Muhammad, is his last and last messenger
 kisi vyakti ko usee kshan se islam main dharmantarit maan liya jaataa he, jab vah nisthapurvak vishwaas kii ghoshnaa karata he, jise shahda kehete hai
 According to the teachings of Islam, every person is a Muslim by birth because every child born has a natural inclination towards good and only worship of the one true God, but his parents and society can divert him from this straight path
 
 jab koi vyakti islam ko sweekaar karata he, to aisa mana jaataa he ki vah apni mul sthiti main laut aayaa he
 Although conversion to Islam is one of its most supported elements, conversion from Islam to any other religion is considered a sin of apostasy and according to some interpretations and under certain jurisdictional jurisdictions there is a provision for capital punishment
 
 islam main, khatna ek sunnah rivaaj he, jiskaa quran main zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 The main idea is that it is not mandatory to follow and it is not a condition to enter Islam
 shafi` tathaa hanabali sampradaayon main ise anivaary mana jaataa he, jabaki maaliki or hanaafi sampradaayon kaa maananaa he ki yah keval anushansit he
 However, it is not a pre-condition for a person to adopt Islamic practices, nor is it a sin for a person to refuse to be circumcised
 yah islam ke paanch stambhon yaa vishwaas ke chah aadhaaron main se ek nahin he
 Although Bahá'í religion actively searches for converts, conversion is prohibited and no "missionary" work is conducted
 Although, in practice, proselytizing and missionary work are done, they are called "teaching" and "guiding" respectively
 apane dharm ko dusron ke saath saajha karte samay bahaai log “ek shravan praapt karne” ke prati satark hote hai–jiskaa arth yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki ve jis vyakti ko shiksha dene kaa prastaav de rahe hai, vah unki baat sunne ko taiyaar he
 In the communities they adopt, "bahá'í Guides" are encouraged to apply to Bahá'í principles while joining society and living and working with their neighbors, rather than attempting to take the place of people's cultural underpinnings
 
 bahaai log sabhi dharmon kii divya utpatti ko manyata pradaan karte hai or yah maanate hai ki ye dharm kramik rup se ek divya yojana ke ek bhaag ke rup main utpann hue, tathaa prayek nayaa prakatikaran apane purvavartiyon kaa sthaan letaa he or unhen purna karata he
 The Bahá'ís consider their own religion to be the latest and believe that its teachings - centered around the principle of humanity's unity - are best suited to meet the needs of the global community
 adhikansh deshon main, dharmatarann ke liye keval vishwaas kii ghoshnaa karne vaale ek card ko bharna hota he
 This includes the declaration of Baha'u'llah - the founder of this religion - to be the messenger of God for the present time, to be aware of and accept their teachings, and to be obedient to the institutions and rules established by them
 bahaai dharm main dharmantaran ke saath hi sabhi gyaat dharmon kii aam buniyaad main spasht vishwaas, maanavtaa kii ekta or vrihat str par samudaay kii sakriy seva, visheshtah un kshetron main, jinase ekta va maitri ko badhaava mili, ke prati ek patibaddhta shaamil hoti he
 Since there are no priests in the Bahá'í religion, converts coming to this religion are encouraged to be active in all aspects of community life
 yahaan tak ki haal hi main dharmantarit hue kisi vyakti ko bhi sthaneey aadhyatmik sab sabha – saamudyik str par maardarshak bahaai sanstha – main kaary karne ke liye chunaa ja saktaa he
 Hinduism does not support conversion and there is no ritual for conversion
 yah spasht rup se paribhaashit nahin he ki koi vyakti hindu kab banataa he kyonki hindu dharm ne kabhi bhi duusare dharmon ko apane pratidwandviyon ke rup main nahin dekha
 anek hinduon kii dharna yah he ki ‘hindu hone ke liye vyakti ko hindu ke rup main janm lenaa padataa he’ or ‘yadi koi vyakti hindu ke rup main janma he, to vah sadaa ke liye hindu hi rahata he’; haalanki, bhartiya kanoon kisi bhi aise vyakti ko hindu ke rup main manyata pradaan karata he, jo swayan ko hindu ghoshit kare
 hindu dharm ke anusaar, keval ek hi param satya he or satya tak “pahunchane” ke anek path—anya dharmon dwaara paalan kiye jane vaale pathon sahit— hai
