 After Rolling regained his body in the fourth edition of the novel, Voldemort was left with pale skin, a white face like a chalice, a snake-like nasal cavity, a red-eyed and cat-like gullible, skeleton-like body, and unnaturally long fingers

 Rolling describes Voldemort as "the worst wizard of hundreds of years"
 unhone use "atyadhik manorogi, anya logon kii pidaa par manushyik pratikriya kaa abhavi" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 At the same time, he has been shown to be the slayer of others, especially the Maghuls, because of his happiness
 uske andar chetana kaa abhaav tha, vah apane kiye par use koi pachhtaawaa nahin hota tha tathaa vah apane atirikt insaaniyat kaa mahatva bhi nahin samajhataa tha
 He neither liked to establish companionship or friendship with man nor did he have any love or affection for anyone
 vah swayan ko shreshth samajhataa tha or apane saamne sabhi ko hin maanata tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was "a truly starving, racist of incredible strength"
 agar vah khwaish darpan main dekhtaa to vah swayan ko "sarvashaktimaan or avinashi" ke rup main dekhtaa jaisaa vah chahta tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was born as a result of a love decoction by his mother and sorceress Meropi Gaunt on a Magaloo and his father Tom Riddle, a result of a failed love

 The attraction that led to the transformation of the boy born as Tom Riddle to Voldemort is very necessary because it shows the concept that led to this character
 lagbhag sabhi khalnaayakon ke samaan, voldemort kaa dambh hi uske patan kaa kaaran banataa he

 While watching an old story in the sixth part, Voldemort claimed during a job interview in front of Dumbledore that he had "increased the limits of magic more than ever"
 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort kii jaadui gyaan kisi bhi jivit jaadugar se bahut adhik he or yahan tak ki voldemort ke puri shakti ke saath lautne par uske mantron ke saamne dambldor ke paas sabase taqatvar bachaav mantra hone kaa gyaan bhi aparyaapt hoga
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort is probably the smartest student of Hogwarts
 parantu voldemort main yah vilakshan pratibha tathaa kaushal hote hue bhi vah pyaar jaise shaktishaalee jaadu kaa saamana karne main ayogy tha; is samay koi shaktiyaan kaam nahin karti thi

 Rolling has revealed on his website that Voldemort's wand was made from a verdant tree with poisonous juice that symbolized his death

 He chose it because the evergreen pruned bush is considered a symbol of revenge from the enemy
 rolling ne pustak main yah sthapit kiya he ki voldemort harry ke maathe par bane nishaan ke madhyam se uske saath jaadui rup se judaa tha
 The mark was formed on Harry's forehead when he cursed Harry and caused a reverse effect on him
 pustak tathaa filmon main yah dikhaaya gaya he ki harry kaa yah nishaan voldemort kii upasthiti kaa sanketak tha
 It hurts more when Anishtadeva was close to him or he shows an unkind or very happy feeling

 Ideology is a systematic technical process of thinking and rendering theory, political, legal, moral, aesthetic, religious and philosophical thought in socio-political philosophy

 Critics of ideology often treat it as a subject of faith that has no scientific basis
 tark diya jaataa he ki kisi vichaardhaara vishesh ke anuyaayi use apane aap main satya maanakar uskaa anusaran karte hai, uske satyaapan kii aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi jaati
 In fact, supporters of each ideology must offer some theory and logic to confirm it and try to instill faith and trust in the other's mind

 Communist chinthadhara holds that most ideas, especially those related to the organization of society, are class ideas

 That class imposes these ideas on the rest of the society because this class is the owner of all means of propaganda
 virdohi virgon vaale samaaj main vichaardhaaratmak sangharsh varg hiton ke sangharsh ke anuroop hota he, kyonki vichaardhaara yatharth kaa sachcha yaa jhootha pratibimb bhi ho saktaa he or vaigyanik yaa avaigyanik bhi ho saktaa he
 The interests of reactionary classes nurture false ideology

 According to communist beliefs, the development of ideology is ultimately determined by the economy, but at the same time there is some relative freedom

 Apart from all this, much of the expression of relative independence of ideology is in the operation of internal rules of ideological development, as well as in ideological spheres, which are situated far away from the economic base
 vichaardhaara kii saapeksh swatantraaa kaa kaaran yah he ki vichaardhaaratmak vikascram vibhinn aarthiketar karkon ke prabhavantargat rahata he
 These factors are: the internal sequential relationship in the development of ideology, the personal role of ideologues and the mutual influence of various forms of ideology, etc

 saidhantik rup se saarvajanik hit use kah sakate hai jisamen yaa to prayek vyakti labhanvit ho yaa phir jisamen logon ke ek varg ko laabh ho or dusron ko koi nuksaan na ho
 However, in reality, matters of public interest have many consequences other than the above, and where one class benefits, the other suffers

 To find this complete statistic, five types of forces are extracted
 ucch bal sthaneey bal kaa ek bhaag he
 In this force, the planet is provided with a force according to its position between its high and low point
 ek grah jo apane ucch bindu ki taraf ja rahaa hota he use arohi grah kehete hai
 And if the planet is moving towards its low point, then it is called descending planet
 purna bali grah ko ek rupa ank diye jate hai
 And on the contrary, the planet receives zero force at its low point
 awasaiya bal yaa sthaneey bal nikaalane ke liye ucch bal ke baad jis bal ko nikaala jaataa he
 He is the seventh power
 is bal main saat varg charto main grah bal nikaala jaataa he
 The seven classes used in the Saptvargiya force are the following
 janm kundalee, hora, dreshkone, saptansh, navansh, dwadshashan, trishansh varg kundalee
 Apart from this, planets in all these square horoscopes get strength on the basis of Mooltrikona, Swarashi, Mitrarashi, Even sign and enemy sign
 yahaan dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki mul trikon ko keval janm kundalee main hi dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he
 This force is obtained from the position of the planet in the even or odd zodiac in the birth chart and the navamsa horoscope
 chandra, shukr stri grah maane gayi hai tathaa shesh sabhi grah purush grah he
 Female planets get strength in even zodiac sign and navamsa
 tathaa purush grahon ko visham raashi or navansh main bal praapt hota he
 But male planets do not get any force in even zodiac and navamsa and female planets in odd zodiac and navamsa
 yah bal bhi awasaiya bal gyaat karne ke liye nikaala jaataa he
 In this force, the planet receives the highest marks in the center house ie 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th house
 grah panfar bhav main uparokt ankon ke aadhe ank praapt karata he
 And if the planets are in the Apocalyptic house, then one gets half the number of Panfar
 sthaneey bal yaa awasaiya bal nikaalane ke liye uparokt chaar bal nikaalane ke baad dreshkone bal nikaala jaataa he
 In this force, planets are classified as female planets, impotent planets and male planets
 iske pashchaat purush grah pehle dreshkone, stri grah tisare dreshkone va napunsak grah dusre dreshkone main ank praapt karata he

 Hart has included Hazrat Umar in his famous book The Hundred The 100: a Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History

 Umar used to participate in the annual wrestling matches

 And wanted to kill Muhammad sahib
 umr shuru main but parasti karte the
 Omar was from a rich family in Mecca, a very brave and courageous person
 umr musalamaanon ko pasand nahin karte the, naa hi mohammad sahab ke mishan ko
 But Prophet Muhammad sahab went to Kabaa one evening and prayed to Allah that Allah should give Umar or Amr Abu Jahl to both of you who are dear to you
 yah dua umr ke haq main qabool hui
 Omar had once set out with the intention of killing the Prophet, a man named Naeem was found on the way who told Omar that his sister and her husband had brought Islam
 umr gusse main aakar bahan ke ghar chal diye
 Both of them were studying Quran at home
 umr unase kuran maangane lage magar unhone manaa kar diya
 Omar became angry and started killing them both
 magar unki bahan ne kaha ham mar jaaenge lekin islam nahin chodenge
 Omar felt ashamed to see the blood dripping from his sister's face and realized the mistake
 kaha ki main kuran padhanaa chahta hoon, isko apamaanit nahin karuunga vaayada kiya
 When Omar read the Quran, he said that it is the declaration of God that no human being can be created
 ek chamatkaar kii tarah se umr kuran ke satya ko grahan kar liya tathaa mohammad sahab se milane gayi
 Muhammad Sahab was very happy when Omar entered Islam
 musalamaanon khushi kii lahar daud gai umr ke islam laane par
 Omar announced that now everyone will study together in the Namaz Kabe, which no one could have imagined earlier
 umr islam ke shatru the parantu ab vah islam ke sarankshak ban gayi
 Seeing Omar in Islam created a furore among Muhammad's enemies
 ab islam ko umr naam kii ek tej talwaar mil gai thi jisase sara makka tharrata tha
 The Meccans hurled their sobs at the weak Muslims, upon which Muhammad sahab prayed to Allah, then Allah ordered him to go to Medina
 saare musalmaan chhupakar madeene kii taraf hizrat yani pravaas karne lage
 But Omar was very courageous, took his sword, took a bow and shot, reached near the Kaaba and did a tawaaf, read two rakat hymns and then said "who wants to make his mother cry on himself, orphan his children and widow his wife
" Meet the place
 " kisi kaa saahas nahin hua ki umr ko roke
 Omar declared his obeisance

 In the battle of Badr, Muslims were defeated and the Musharis of Mecca were defeated
 badr kii jang ke ek saal baad makka vaale ekajute ho kar madeene pe hamalaa karne aa gaye, jang uhud naamak pahari ke paas hui
 In the beginning of the war, the Muslim army was heavy but due to some reasons the Muslims were defeated
 kuch logon ne afvaah uda di ki mohammad sahab shahid kar diye gayi to bahut se muslim ghabara gaye, umr ne bhi talwaar phenk di tathaa kehane lage ab jeena bekaar he
 After some time i came to know that this is a rumor and then stood again

 On 8 June 632, Muhammad Sahib said goodbye to the world
 umr tathaa kuch log ye vishwaas hi naa rakhte the ki mohammad sahab kii mutyu bhi ho sakati he
 On hearing this news, Umar lost his senses, took out his sword and started saying loudly that i will separate his head from the person who said that the prophet has died
 is najuk maukey par tabhi hazarat abu bakr ne musalamaanon ko ek khutaba arthath bhaashan diya jo bahut mashhoor he: Then read the verse of the Quran: hazarat abu bakr se sunakar tamaam log gash khaakar gir gayi, umr bhi apane ghutanon ke bal gir gayi tathaa is bahut baden du:kha ko sweekaar kar liya
 When Hazrat Abu Bakr felt that his time was near, he chose Hazrat Umar for the next Khalifa
 umr unki asaadhaaran ichha shakti, buddhi, raajnneetik, nishpakshta, nyaay or garibon or vanchiton logon ke liye dekhbhaal ke liye acchhee tarah se jane jate the
 Hazrat Abu Bakr was fully aware of Omar's power and his ability to succeed
 umr kaa uttaradhikaar is prakaar ke rup main dusron ke kisi bhi rup main pareshaani nahin tha
 Hazrat Abu Bakr wrote his will to Hazrat Usman before his death that Omar would be his successor

 In the theory of affection, John Bowlby conceptualized man's tendency to form a strong affection for particular people, and described anxiety, anger, sadness, and isolation, along with personality problems and emotional pains arising from conflict

 The child's first relationship begins with the mother
 smith kehete hai ki kudarat ne is rishte ko majboot banaaya he, to samaaj, dharm or sahitya ne maan or bachche ke sneh ko pavitrataa pradaan kii
 In this article, after the sociologists discuss two concepts of affectionate relationships in human society, in the context of alternative thinking of affection, by giving a brief description of studies on the chicks of birds like goose, duck, etc
, of Larenz, and children of Harlow's monkey
 , The affection theory of Balbi is kept
 or ant main sneh siddhanth ke anya kshetron main badhate daayre par nazar daali gayi he
 In 1958, Harry Harlow of America and John Bowlby of England, the idea of child and mother is the foundation of society, was presented in separate research papers
 isse pehle samajashastriyon main samooh ke aadhaar ke bare main do avadharanayen prachlit thim
 The first is linked to the theory of learning, and it is related to the belief of behaviorists that a newborn baby needs milk, which the mother gives, so the child stays close to the mother
 manovishleshanvaadiyon ne isamen kaam yaa sex kii pravriti ko joda, jiske kai aayam hai, jon balbi ne inkaa ullekh apane shodh patr main vistaar se kiya he
 With no concrete evidence about both of these concepts, Harlow and Bowlby rejected them, and began looking for alternatives
 or donon kaa dhyaan jantuon ke vyavhaar par prakritik vaataavaran main ho rahe adhyayanon par gaya, jise itholaji kehete hai
 Larynz, an ethologist, had observed in studies on some birds, goose, duck, etc
, that the chick would follow her mother along with her safety, and she would also have experience of finding food and swimming
 hans yaa batakh ke chuujon main, larenz ke anusaar, is tarah se jaldi seekhney, adhyankan ke liye vaataavaran se teen tarah ke uttejk zaruri hai, chuze kii awaz ke uttar main ek kism kii awaz; koi vastu chuze se dur ja rahi ho; vah vastu samay-samay par awaz nikaale
 Often this item will be the mother of the chick, as it is nearby when the chick comes out of the egg
 maan kii jagah, yadi koi aadmi ho to chuza usee ke peeche chalegaa, par yah tino gun usamen hone chahie
 Adhyanaka means the impression of a mother or caretaker on the newborn's mind
 larenz ne yah khoj 1935 main kii thi
 Once it is hit or imprinted in the chick, it does not change easily
 arthath hans ke chuze main yadi andey se baahar nikalne ke ekadam baad yadi hans kaa thappa lag jaye to vah jivan bhar hans ke peeche chalegaa
 If the first image in the chick is made of man, it will follow the man, not the goose
 vah aadmi patali ladki ho yaa boodhaa mard, koi farak nahin padegaa
 The most surprising thing was for Larenz, if the mother who raised goose chick was of another species, after a few years when the chick became adult, then for breeding, selected the bird of the same species which was the mother of the breeding mother
 Do not laugh
 yahi parinaam baad main bhed main bhi dekhe gaye, jinka varnan neeche kiya gaya he
 Larenz has written that, although learning comes under learning, it does not require seduction like learning or learning
 yah jantuon main ek aisi prakriya he jo prakritik avasthaa main bachche kaa maan se pragadh sambandh banane main sahaayak he or iskaa doorgaami asar hota he
 The discovery and ethnology of Larenz's study also influenced John Balby's thinking
 iske saath ek mahatpurna baat jo sneh siddhanth kii aadharshila majboot karne main sahaayak hui, vah thi harlo or balbi ke bich vichaaron kaa aadan-pradaan
 The medium was the ethologist Robert Hynd, who at the time was studying the behavior of mother and child in monkeys in England
 harlo or balbi is baat se prabhavit the ki navjaat shishu ke sahaj vyavhaar use maan se jodate hai
 Harlow proved it with a prongo on a monkey and Balby gathered information on the children of humans and gave it an ideological look
 harlo ne vyavahaarwadiyon or manovishleshkon par prahaar karte hue kaha, haalaanki yah sahi he ki maan bachche kii doodh kii zaroorat puri karti he isliye usase sambandh ban saktaa he, parantu aise sambandh kisi bhi vastu se ban sakate hai or vah jaldi tut bhi jate hai
 Therefore, there should be a study of the innate behaviors that bind the mother in relationships of affection
 unhone aage likhaa, kyonki maanav ke navjaat shishu par is tarah ke prayog nahin ho sakate, isliye bandar ke bacchon ko chunaa
 By then Harlow had managed to raise the monkeys in the laboratory within 6 to 12 hours, separated from their mother
 nae prayogon main harlo ko, balbi dwaara manushya ke bacchon main dekhe gaye do sahaj vyavhaar ke bare main, bandar ke bacchon main paryaapt samanta mili, jaise, navjaat shishu kaa naram vastu se chipaknaa tathaa uske saath zyada samay bitaana
 Not only this, Harlow found that the monkey children of about 300 days of age started spending more time looking at the mother's synonym wrapped in soft cloth or cloth mother surrogate
 agle kai saalon main jo prayog hue unka saransh margret harlo or harry harlo ne 1966 main ek shodh patr main diya he
 In this research paper he wrote that the innate tendency of sex or sex has lost the basis of tying the group between humans and monkeys
 vah aage likhte hai ki bandar ke bachche ke saamaajik vikaas par viscansin vishvavidhyalay main jo khoj hui he usase paanch premamulak tantron yaa affectional systems kaa pataa laga, jo in bandaron main saamaajik sambandhon kaa aadhaar he
 These are the five affectionate systems - the child-mother affection system; Child-to-child affection system; Heterosexual affection system; Maternal affection system; And paternity affection system
 ant main unhone likhaa he ki yah paanch sneh tantra nar-vanar samooh yaa primates ke vikaas main mahatvapurn rahe honge
 These would have helped the group members to interact, which led to group collaboration, enhanced ability to cope with external forces, and provided the child with a learning environment
 sneh ke doorgaami parinaamon ke bare main isse bhi or adhik jaankaree bandaron par hue un prayogon se mili jo harry harlo or unke saathiyon ne bandar ke bacchon ko unki maan se alag kar, vistaar main kai saalon tak dekhe, jinka varnan harlo or miars ne ek kitaab main kiya he, tathaa manushya main balbi ne maan se algaav or maan ke vilop kaa bachche par asar sneh siddhant ke khand-2 or khand-3 main kiya jiskaa parichay agle bhaag main diya gaya he
 Balbi wrote that work on the Sneh Siddhanta started in 1956, and in many papers, scientific problems related to it were discussed from 1953 to 1963, but the main form of Sneh Siddhanta was in the three sections Sneh and Declaration or Attachment and Loss — in 1969
 -1; Section-2 in 1973; And, in 1978, section 3 was printed
 balbi or unki sahyogi ensworth ne in teen khandon main chape mukhya vichaaron tathaa isse judi khojon ke itihaas par prakaash daalate hue likhaa ki vah donon shaikshik vyavsaay main aane se pehle hi bacchon ke vyaktitv ke vikaas main mata-pita ke yogadan par kaam kar rahe the, visheshkar vah bachche jo akele rah jate hai, jinhen maan kaa prem nahin miltaa
 He further writes, that Balby's first study on 44 young thieves revealed that most of these children were those who did not get affection
 iske baad vishwa swasthy sanghathan ke liye balbi ne ek report taiyaar kii, jo maatrutiv kaa bachche ke maansik swasthya main yogadan se judi thi, or iskaa mukhya uddeshy bachche kii parvarish se sneh kaa vikaas karnaa tha
 The main points of affection theory in the three volumes of Balbi are according to Ainsworth and Bowlby
 khand-1 ke pehle or duusare bhaag main sneh siddhanth se jude udvikas ke vichaaron tathaa sahaj vyavhaaron ke adhyayan kaa vistaar main varnan he
 In addition, by rejecting the principle of the physical requirements of affection, behavioral systems and operating mechanisms that have a specific purpose, such as the study of Larenz and the loving systems of Harlow
 inke atirikt, balbi ne likhaa he ki manushyon main, bachche ke vikaas ke saath-saath sneh se jude maan evam anya vyaktiyon kii chhavi tathaa uskaa sahaj vyavhaaron se sambandh aantarik kaaryakari praroopon ko janm dete hai, jinka sneh siddhant main vishesh sthaan he
 In the beginning of the fifth part of section 1, four stages of development of affection are given
 avasthaa-1, aarambh kii is avasthaa main navjaat baccha ek vishesh prakaar se logon se vyavhaar karata he : vyakti kii ore mudana, aankhon se peechha karnaa, pakadana, pahunchnaa, hansanaa, aadi
 Phase-2, more use of the above behaviors, but pay special attention to the mother
 avasthaa-3, baccha logon ko pahchaanane lagata he, maan ko vishesh rup se dekhtaa he, or nae logon se vyavhaar alag ho jaataa he
 Phase-4, Improvement of the object of affection or close relationship with the mother, and behaviors related to it
 balbi ke khand-2 main bachche ke un sahaj vyavhaaron par vishesh dhyaan diya gaya he jo sneh kii vastuon se algaav ke kaaran paidaa hote hai, or saath main aisi sthitiyaan jin main sneh tantra karyanvit hote hai
 According to Balby, this is the basis of the development of different personality of children, such that some children will be timid, or some will have more concern about affection
 iske atirikt bachche ke saamaanya vikaas main sneh ke majboot aadhaar par bhi bal diya gaya he
 Section 3 of Balbi describes the processes of cognition that are helpful in unconsciously combining information
 inkaa aantarik kaaryakari praroopon ke vikaas main vishesh mahatva bataaya gaya he
 The main focus in this section is on grief in an adult person
 sneh kii vastu ke vilop yaa chale jane se vyakti chaar avasthaaon se gujaregaa—sunnata; sneh kii vastu kii taras or gussa; avyavashtha or niraashaa; tathaa, punahsangyojan kaa prayaas or udaasi
 Looking at the growing base in the animals of affection theory, Alison Jolly writes, the process of growth selects a strong, abundant and personal relationship between the child and the mother, perhaps named love
 yadhyapi harlo ne in premamulak sambandhon ko bandar main bachche or maan, tathaa balbi ne manushya main bachche or uski dekhbhaal karne vaale vyakti, tak simit rakhaa, par unhone, joli kahati he, sneh ko saamaajik jivan kaa aadhaar bataaya
 In this part of the article, the growing underpinnings of Harlow and Balby's ideas will be gauged from studies on mammals, from rats to monkeys, and in humans the relationship between the devotee and his imperial deity
 candal ke anusaar manushyon, or vastav main sabhi stanadhariyon main bachche ke aarambh ke vaataavaran kaa sabase mukhya ang maan he
 He further writes that the loss of parents' relationship with the children due to the breakdown of the family during the Second World War was unfortunate for their development
 candal likhte hai, harlo dwaara bandar ke bacchon par kiye gaye prayongon se is vichaar ko vaigyanik aadhaar mila, parantu isamen mukhya yogadan balbi kaa rahaa
 Two important things that Kendall has pointed out
 ek, maan-baap apane bachche ke vyavhaar se samvegatmak rup se jude hote hai, jisamen mukhya baat he bachche ko kushi or dukh dene vaali ghatnaon kaa nivaaran
 Two, in humans and animals, for the first 2-3 years, the child is dependent on the memory system that is unconscious, the changes that occur with aging make the conscious or explicit memory system
 yah donon baaten, candal ke anusaar, manushyon or jantuon main sneh ke tantron ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 Kendall reported that when the child was separated from the mother in the rat, such behaviors were seen as in the man's separation from the mother in the child, primarily a protest, and then a state of sadness
 iskaa asar hipothelemic-pityuiteri-adrenal tantra main dekha gaya
 These changes give rise to chemical processes that hinder the child's conscious or explicit memory system
 arthath yah smriti tantra yaa to viksit nahin ho pataa, yaa thik se niyantran nahin kar pataa jab bhi tanaav kii paristhiti ho
 Sheep and goats live in groups or flocks, both natural and domesticated
 memne kaa samooh ke saath lagaav ho yah maamne or samooh donon ke liye zaruri samajha gaya he
 Smith observed the development of this attachment or relationship in sheep during the study that the lamb stood up a short time after birth and put its head under an object that was equal to its shoulder
 aam taur se yah bhed kii agali yaa pichhali taangon ke bich kii jagah hoti he, iske saath-saath bhed bhi memne kaa chaatati ore soonghti he, tathaa sir or moonh se sahalaati he
 Smith has written describing these behaviors that on the one hand the mother creates the image of her child in her brain, on the other hand the lamb is related to the mother
 yadi memne or bhed yaa bakrii ke bich yah sambandh armbh main nahin ban paata to bhed yaa bakrii memne ko nakaar degi or memna samooh ke saath nahin chalata
 a far-reaching impact of this relationship was also seen
 aam taur se bhed or bakriyaan ek revad main rahati he, vyask hone par bhed prajnan ke liye bhed ko hi chunegi or bakrii apni prajati kaa saathi
 Kendrick and his companions observed that, if born to a lamb, a goat to a lamb, and a goat to a lamb, if an adult, the sheep that grew up with the goat would choose the goat for breeding, and the goat whom Sheep reared will choose sheep for breeding
 iske atirikt kendrick ne yah bhi dekha ki bheden anya bhedon ke chehre, lagbhag 50 tak, kaaphi der tak yaad rakh sakati he
 According to Alison Jolly, affection relations in the male-apes group have the following main characteristics
 nar-vanar samooh kii pehali visheshta he ki baccha shaareerik or samvegatmak rup se maan se judaa he, or yah sambandh lemur se lekar manushya tak or adhik jatil hota jaataa he
 This relation of mother to child has special importance in the training of social behavior in the early period of life
 duusare, joli ke anusaar, maan jab tak bachche ko vishesh rup main nahin dekhe vah thik se ji nahin paayegaa, yaa uske saamaajik vyavhaar main kami rah jaaegi
 For example, it is important that the mother place her baby in her dock, let her breastfeed, clean her, and rub her and help her
 bachche ke sahaj vyavhaar, jaise, chipaknaa, rengna, jadta, tathaa chusna is sambandh ko majboot banaate hai
 Along with these, many varieties of voices attract mother and child towards each other
 tisare, joli kaa kahana he ki jon balbi ne shashakt rup se larenz ke adhyankan ke siddhanth ko maanav ke vikaas ke sandarbh main rakhaa
 Not only this, Balbi took the initiative to look at the child in the context of development by getting out of the helpless state
 arthath bachche main aise vyavhaaron kaa chayan hua jisase vah maan ke sampark main rahe, use pahachaane, ajnavi se dare, or khatra hote hi maan ke paas jaye
 Fourth, Jolly believes that the child in the male-apes group does not necessarily die in the absence of the mother, the child's behavior is able to instill a sense of motherhood in the other members of the group
 joli kaa kahana he ki saamaajik vyavhaar main ek str par yadi chook ho jaae, uski bharpai kii kai sambhaavnaaen hai
 The child's partner and other adult males and females help in this
 ant main, joli kaa maananaa he ki prakritik avasthaa main aisi asankhya ghatnaayen ghatati hai jinka prayogshaala main andaja lagaana kathin he
 These events empower the child, such as, when the child is older, weaning, keeping away from the lap, helping to jump from the tree, feeling of danger, etc
 balbi ne khand-1 ke ant main kuch baton ko rekhaankit kiya he
 First, the difference between the nature of affection and affection practices was explained
 duusare, unhone kaha bachche kaa sneh vastu ke saath vyavhaar sneh bandhan kaa aadha bhaag he
 The mother's treatment of the child, and then the father's and other members' contribution to it, completes it
 tisare, bacchon ke vyaktitv main sneh ke anek namoonay yaa praaroop milte hai, maansik swasthya main yogadan ke liye inhen samajhnaa atyaadhik zaruri hoga
 According to Balbi, the three sections of the principle of affection, making affection with object, separation from affection, and extinction of the object of affection, are necessary to understand affection jointly
 sneh siddhanth ke upar jo adhyayan hue hai, tencrede or frele ke anusaar, un main sneh ko samgr rup se dekha gaya he, chaahe vah bachche or maan ke bich ho, vyask nar or nari main prem, yaa bhakt or uskaa aradhya dev
 Tencrede and Frelle outlined the four main features or criteria of the principle of affection, the close or proximity maintenance of the object of affection, the opposition to separation from the object of affection, and the afflictions or separation distress, the object of affection a secure base or secure base, and the affection of affection
 The object is not a safe haven or safe
 parantu khoj ke liye inase jude kisi ek pahalu par dhyaan dena swaabhaavik he, jaise aantarik kaaryakari praaroop
 Some people have a view about the theory of affection that while John Bowlby brought affection to a scientific level, Ainsworth collected evidence to confirm his views
 ensworth or unke saathiyon ne maan or bachche ke bare main do vidhiyon—grih nirikshan tathaa anokhi paristhiti—se aankade ikatthe kiye
 The first method involves studying the behavior of mother and child at home, and in the second method, separating the child from the mother in a room and meeting an unborn woman, and then observing the child's behavior from the mother at the reunion
 is parikshan se bacchon kii teen shreniyan saamne ai
 Safe or secure children would be happy, calm and play at the time of reunion with their mother

 manushya kaa man or bahari jagat ek duusare ke samaan or saapeksh hai
 Similar to and similar to what happens in outer world, events happen in human mental world
 kabhi kabhi bahari jagat kii ghatnaayen maansik jagat kii ghatnaon kaa kaaran ban jaati he
 There are always conflicts in the mental world
 jis prakaar bahari bhautik jagat main jeev main aatmaraksha or atmprasar ke liye sangharsh hota he, usee prakaar manushya ke maansik jagat main uske vibhinn prakaar ke vichaaro main sangharsh hota he
 The idea that is stronger and whose internal tendency leads to more coordination, the idea survives
 yah vichaar usee ke anuroop anek vichaaron ko janm detaa he, jiske kaaran manushya kaa vishesh prakaar kaa charitra, swabhaav athwa vyaktitv nirmit ho jaataa he
 Mental conflict is a very painful state of mind
 yah sangharsh manushya ke do prabal vichaaron athwa bhaawanaaon main hota he
 By the time this struggle goes on, a man is very restless
 maansik sangharsh dukhadaayi bhale hi ho, parantu yah manushya ke vyaktitv ke vikaas ke liye nitant aavashyak he
 To calm and end the conflict of two strong emotions, such a principle is needed which can co-ordinate the thoughts or feelings of the conflict, or which will position one thought and remove the other from consciousness
 viksit vyaktitv kaa purush vahi he jiske jivan main sudrudh, sunishchit kuch moulik siddhanton kaa vikaas hua he, jo in siddhanton kii kasuti par sabhi nae vichaaron tathaa nai bhaawanaaon ko kasata he or unamem jo khara utarataa he use hi apane vyaktitv main sthaan detaa he, uske anusaar aacharan karata he or jo khota nikalataa he use hataa detaa he
 This type of mechanism leads to the emergence of duty scripture and philosophy
 yadi manushya ko maansik sangharsh kii anubhuti na ho, to ne karttavyashaastra or na darshan kaa hi janm ho
 Animals experience minimal mental conflict
 unamem vah maansik vikaas sambhav hi nahin he jo manushya main hota he
 Mental conflict has been discussed since ancient times
 is prakaar ke ek sangharsh kaa chitra ham bhagavadgita main pate hai
 The conflict that was going on in the mind of Arjuna was more important than the physical conflict between the Kauravas and the Pandavas during the Mahabharata
 pehle sangharsh kaa parinaam keval usee desh or kaal ke liye mahatv kaa tha jisamen mahabharat yuddh hua
 The result of the second conflict still holds its importance
 vah is desh or kaal ke logon ke liye pathpradarshak ban gaya
 As a result of this struggle, a new philosophy was born, which is important for the whole world
 uparyukt sangharsh kii charchaa sansar ke sabhi deshon ke vidwaanon ne kii he or unhone apane apane drushtibindu se yah bataane kii cheshtaa kii he ki aise sangharsh kaa ant kis prakaar kiya jaay
 Modern psychology has drawn attention to a new type of conflict
 yah sangharsh aisa he jiskaa gyaan hi hamen nahin ho paata
 The first type of conflict is between those thoughts or feelings that we have knowledge or that we can know, so we can end such conflict
 yadi ham swayan is sangharsh kaa apni hi kshamta se ant nahin kar sakate, to duusare gyani vyakti yaa vyaktiyon kii sahaayta lekar ham use dur kar sakate hai
 We consider such a person a guru, a sage or a philosopher
 is tarah bhagavan krishna arjuna ke gruru the
 He was a sage and philosopher
 agyaat man ke sangharsh kaa ant karnaa gyaat man ke sangharsh kaa ant karne se kahin adhik kathin kaary he
 How can we coordinate the two opposing parties which we do not know? Then what can be the usefulness of Guru here? When a person knows that there is a struggle in his mind, then only he will go to the Guru and try to get light from him
 kitne hi log, jinke man main prabal agyaat sangharsh chalate rahete hai, praaia: yah jaanate hi nahin hai ki unke man main sangharsh kii sthiti he
 Many such people consider the presence of this unknown, or unconscious mind, conflict to be a useless principle
 is agyaat man ke sangharsh ke pramaan kya he? sansar ke vidwaanon ne yah kaise janaa ki koi achetan man kaa bhi sangharsh he? aadhunik kaal main is sangharsh kii khoj pahal pahal dow frid ne kii
 He has promoted the theory that there are two parts of the human mind - one conscious and the other unconscious
 isamen manushya kaa chetan man achetan man kii apeksha bahut hi chota he
 The conscious mind is the eighth part of the entire mind
 baaki sab bhaag achetan he
 We have knowledge of the events of conscious mind; Knowledge of the events of the unconscious mind is usually not there
 hamaare achetan man main ve sabhi icchaayen, bhav or vichaar upasthit rahete hai jinhen ham barabas apni chetana se hataa dete hai or jinaki smriti dabaane kii prabal cheshtaa karte he
 There are many types of these desires, feelings or thoughts
 ve aapas main usee prakaar pratidwandv karte hai jis prakaar ve chetnavastha main karte hai, parantu unke in sangharshon kaa hamen gyaan nahin hota
 Just as our consciousness not only has mutual conflict in the desires, feelings and thoughts of different asymmetrical nature, everyone struggles with the main principle of our life, similarly in these powers of the unconscious mind also there is not only mutual conflict
 , But everyone also struggles with the moral self that is under the human consciousness, that is, inadvertently, this struggle by coming to the level of consciousness The facilitators lives
 yah naitik swatv sarkaar ke us guptchar vibhaag ke samaan he, jo raja ke anjaane hi rajya main anek prakaar ke anarth paidaa karanevaale badmaashon kaa daman karata rahata he
 Just as the thieves and bandits of the state fear the government's intelligence department and roam the society only after saving their eyes, similarly many immoral, repressed feelings of human beings come to the level of consciousness by avoiding the sight of its moral self
 iske liye ve anek prakaar ke swang rachate hai tathu anek prakaar ke shadyantr karte hai
 Dr
 Freud has called these conspiracy methods, or deceitful methods, amusing
 ye manorachnaayen vibhinn prakaar kii hoti hai
 Their direct appearance is seen in human dreams
 manushya ke swapn praaia: uski damit ichchhaaon, bhaawanaaon or vichaaron ke dwaara hi rachit hote hai
 Man's dream world is a unique world
 manovigyaan kii drushti se manushya kaa koi bhi swapn nirarthak nahin haata, parantu swapn kaa arth jaanane ke liye manorachnaon kii vidhi ko or swapn kii bhashaa ko samajhnaa nitant aavashyak he
 In a dream, sometimes lust is satisfied by reversing, just as a woman's strong sex creates dreams of rape
 jis vyakti se ham ghrinaa karte hai, uski mrityu kaa swapn dekhte hai, parantu yah ghrinaa kaa bhav hamen gyaat na rahane ke kaaran uske liye ham rote hai
 Many teenage boys dream of father's death
 koun kishor balak kahegaa ki ham apane pita se ghrinaa karte hai
 a small gesture becomes illuminated as a long and wide phenomenon
 katu bhav meetha ho jaataa he or meetha bhav katu
 In the dream, more things are published as symbols
 hawa main udana, seedhi par chadhana or pani main tairnaa pratik rup se kamtripti hai
 Riot dreams are dreams of rape
 bhens, saand, sarp, maala, chaaku sabhi kamvasana ke pratik hai
 Repressed lust is illuminated by these symbols
 damit vaasana pratidin kii bhuulon tathaa akaaran bhay or chintaaon se sabhi prakat hoti he
 Due to this, man gets many types of fuss and pleasures
 baar baar haath dhonaa, naak fuskaarna, sar khujalana, batan tona, chaati par haath rakhana, kisi ang ko sadaa hilaate rahanaa - sabhi damit bhaavon ke pratik hai
 The repressed emotion is illuminated by these symbols and man moves towards equilibrium
 anek prakaar ke shaareerik or maansik rog bhi maansik sangharsh ke parinaam hote hai
 These are also the result of the exit of repressed emotions
 maansik rog swayan yah darshata he ki vyakti ke man main maansik sangharsh upasthit he
 The power of repressed emotion is weakened by mental illness
 histyria, neuresthinia, melancolia aadi anek maansik rog damit bhav ko baahar nikaalte hai
 Modern psychoanalytic science introduces us to many types of mental patients
 jaise-jaise sabhyataa kaa vikaas hota jaataa he, maansik rogon kii vruddhi hoti jaati he
 When mental illness is suppressed, then it takes the form of physical disease
 is prakaar anek prakaar ke manejaat shaareerik rog maansik sangharsh kii upasthiti ke parinaam hai
 Asthma, eczema, colitis, heart palpitations, paralysis and constant headache, all these diseases occur due to repressed emotions
 manojaat shaareerik rogi kaa upachaar bhautik oshadhiyon se nahin hota
 They often get aggravated by this type of treatment
 gyaat maansik sangharsh ke niraakaran ke liye rishi, yaa darshanik kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or agyaat maansik rogon ke niraakaran ke liye maansik chikitsak kii
 But a mental doctor is not a blank doctor, his first task is to bring unknown mental conflict to the level of consciousness
 kitne hi prakaar ke maansik sangharsh kaa ant isi se hota jaataa he
 But if this struggle continues even after the repressed emotions come to the level of consciousness, then the doctor has to adopt a proper attitude towards the patient to end it
 is tarah uskaa darshanik or shikshak bhi hona aavashyak he
 The repressed feeling does not come easily at the level of consciousness
 vah anek prakaar kii lucatipi karata he
 To eliminate this temptation one has to change the moral mind of the patient
 uski pun:shiksha hoti he
 Generally, the moral self of a mental patient is very harsh
 use namr banane ke liye chikitsak ko anek prakaar ke ytn karne padate hai
 By showing a lot of love towards the patient, there is so much unity in different parts of the mind that repressed feelings come to the level of consciousness
 iske liyen chikitsak kaa drushtikon atyant udaar hona aavashyak he
 As long as love and service are not dominant in the doctor, he not only needs knowledge of mental medicine to end the unknown mental conflict, but also requires a kind of philosophical understanding and understanding
 iske atirikt chikitsak main bhaavana kii dridhtaa honi chahie, jisase vah rogi ke man main sachaai tathaa udaar bhaavon kaa jaagran kar sake
 With this, the patient is able to accept and end the struggle of his inner mind

 saurashtra main us samay bhadrashrava naam ke raja the
 He was a very powerful king
 chaar veda, chah shaastra, atharah puraanon kaa unhen gyaan tha
 His queen's name was Surtachandrika
 rani dikhne main sundar or sulakshana thi tathaa pativrata thi
 Both of them were blessed with seven sons and a girl after that
 kanya kaa naam shambala tha
 Once Mahalakshmi ji came to mind to go and stay in that king's kingdom
 isse raja ko dugani dhan - daulat kii prapti hogi or vah is dhan daulat se apni praja ko or sukh de paayegaa
 If the poor stays at home and gets wealth, then he will spend only on himself as selfish
 yah sochakar shri mahalakshmi ji ne budhi brahman stri kaa rup dhaaran kiya, haath main lathi liye lathi ke sahare rani ke dwaar tak pahaunchi
 Although he assumed the form of an old woman, the face of the goddess was sharp on her face
 unhen dekhte hi ek daasi saamne ai, usne inkaa naam, dham, kaam, dharm puch daalaa
 Mother Lakshmi, holding the form of an aged Brahmin, said, "balike mera naam kamla hai
 My husband's name is Bhuvanesh
 ham dwarika main rahete he tumhaari rani pichley janm main ek vaisya kii patni thi
 That Vaishya was poor
 daridrya ke kaaran har roj ghar main jhagade hote the tathaa uskaa pati roj use martha tha
 Fed up with these things, she left home and went wandering empty stomach in the forest
 uski is durdasha par mujhe dayaa ai
 Then i told the story of Shri Mahalakshmi who gave her happiness
 mere kehane par usne shri mahalakshmi kaa vrath kiya
 Shri Mahalakshmi was pleased that her poverty was overcome
 uskaa ghar- sansar daulat,santati, sampatti se bhar gaya
 Later both husband and wife went to other worlds
 lakshmi vrath karne ke kaaran ve lakshmi lok main rahe
 For the thousands of years he fasted for Mahalakshmi, he got pleasure
 is janm main uskaa janm rajgaraane main hua he, parantu vah shri mahalakshmi kaa vrath karnaa bhul gai he
 i have come here to remind him
 " budhiya kii bate sunakar daasi ne unhen pranaam kiya, tathaa shri mahalakshmi kaa vrath kis tarah kiya jaye is bare main puchha budhiya rup dhaaran kiye huai shri mahalakshmi mata ne daasi ko puja kii vidhi tathaa mahima bataai
 After this, she bowed to Maid Mata and went inside to tell the queen
 rajvaibhav main rahete huai rani ko apane aishwarya kaa bahut ghamand hua tha
 She was frantic because of property and rights
 daasi dwaara bataai gai budhiya kii baaten sunakar vah aag babula ho kar rajdwar par aa kar budhiya rupi shri mahalakshmi par baras padi
 She did not know that Shri Mahalakshmi Mata had come to the gate assuming the form of old lady
 parantu rani kaa is kadar ruukh bartaav tathaa apana anadar dekhakar mata ne vahaan thaharnaa thik na samajha
 They started from there
 raah main unhen rajkumaari shambala mili unhone shambala ko sari baat bataai shambala ne apni or se shri mahalakshmi mata se kshamaa maangi
 Mother had pity on him
 unhone shambala ko shri mahalakshmi vrath ke bare main bataaya
 That day was the first Thursday of Aghan month
 shambala ne param shraddha se shri mahalakshmi kaa vrath rakhaa
 As a result, he was married to Maladhar, the son of King Siddheshwar
 vah dhan-daulat, aishwarya, vaibhav se maalamaal ho gai
 Anand started spending the day with her husband in-law
 idhar shri mahalakshmi kaa rani par prakope hua
 As a result, the kingdom and king of king Bhadrasrva were destroyed
 yahan tak kii khaane ke laale pad gayi
 In such a situation, one day the queen pleaded with the king, "our son-in-law is such a great king, rich, rich, why not go to him, tell him your situation, he will definitely help us
" " is baat par raja bhadrashrava damaad ke paas ravaanaa huai
 After reaching the state, stayed for some time on the banks of a pond
 talab se pani lene aate jate dasiyon ne unhen dekha
 He politely questioned him when he came to know that he is the father of Rani Shambala, then he ran and told the queen about everything
 rani ne daasi ke haath rajparidhaan bhejkar bade thaath se unka swaagat tathaa adarasatkar kiya
 Got food
 jab ve lautne lage to sone kii moharon se bharaa gadaa diya
 Rani Surtachandrika was delighted when King Bhadrasrava returned
 unhone sone kii moharon se bhare ghade kaa munh khol, par hai bhagwaan ! ghade main dhan ke badale koyale mili yah sab shri mahalakshmi ke prakope se hua is prakaar durdasha main or kai din biit gayi
 This time the queen herself went to her daughter
 vah din aghan maah kaa antim guuruuvaar tha
 Shambala fasted on Sri Mahalakshmi, worshiped, made her mother fast
 iske baad rani apane ghar ai
 On fasting on Shri Mahalakshmi, she again received her kingdom, wealth and wealth
 vah phir se sukh, shaanti, aanandamay jivan bitaane lagi
 a few days later Rajakanya Shambala came to her father's house, seeing her at home, Surtachandrika remembered old things
 yaheen kii shambala ne apane pita ko gadaa bhar koyala diya tha or use to kuch bhi nahin diya tha
 That is why Shambala did not have any respectful hospitality when she came to her father's house
 balki anadar hua
 But he did not mind that
 apane ghar lautate samay usne pita ke ghar se thoda namak le liya
 When you return home, her husband asks, "what did you bring from your maternal grandfather?" To this he replied, "I have brought the essence there
" " pati ne puchha "iskaa matlab kya hua ? " shambala ne kaha "thoda dhiraj rakhe, sab maaloom ho jaayegaa
 "that day Shambala prepared and served the entire meal without adding salt
 pati ne khaanaa chakhaa
 The whole food was without salt, so it did not taste
 phir shambala ne thali main namak daalaa isse sara bhojan swaadisht lagane laga
 Then Shambala said to the husband, "this is the essence brought from the maiden
 " pati ko uski baat sahi lagi
 Then they both started laughing and jokingly laughing

 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki kuch nishchit kathanak roodhiyon or shaileyon main dhali lokkathaon ke anek sanskaran, uske nity nai pravritiyon or chariton se yukt hokar viksit hone ke pramaan he
 The same story takes different forms in different contexts and zones

 Many stories of Panchatantra are popular in folk life as folk tales
 kintu yah bhi sahi he ki jitani kathaayen lokajeevan main mil jaati hai utani panchatantr main bhi nahin milteen
 If it is said that Vishnu Sharma would have benefited from the stories prevalent in folk life, then nothing would be inappropriate
 hitopadesh, brihadashlok sangrah, brihatkatha manjari, katha vetaal panchavinshati aadi kaa mul lokajeevan he
 The Jataka tales are considered highly ancient
 inaki sankhya 550 ke lagbhag he kintu lokkathaon kii koi nirdhaarit sankhya nahin he
 Prakrit language also has many scriptures
 mul pashachi main likhit "bahukaha" katha saritsagar, brihatkatha aadi kaa upjivy bani
 Some of his stories were adapted into Sanskrit
 apbhransh ke "paum charia" or "bhavishyatt kaha" bhi is kram main aati hai
 In this way, the story of the Vedic dialogues in written form is continuously flowing, but the sum of all these also cannot reach the level of stories prevalent in folk life
 hindi lokkathaon ke adhyayan se inaki kuch apni visheshtaon kaa pataa chalata hai
 Man has been in search of pleasures since time immemorial
 sukh loukik env parloukik donon prakaar ke hai
 In the Indian tradition, the parlokik is given a higher position than the temporal, according to "all is well, everything is good"
 shaayad hi aisi koi katha ho jo du:khant ho
 Ever since ancient times, this was the main trend of Indian folklore
 isliye lokkathaon ke paatr anek saahasik evam romaanchakaari ghatnaon se hokar ant main sukh kii prapti karte hai
 Like Sanskrit plays, they also end in coincidence
 ye kathaayen mul rup main mangalakamna kii bhavanaayen lekar ai
 That is why folklorists often say a few words at the end of stories
 jaise - "jis prakaar unke, din phire, vaise hi saat dushman ke bhi din phiren
 " vibhinn prakaar ke daivik evam prakritik prakopon kaa bhay dikhaakar shrotaaon ko dharm tathaa kartavyapaalan ke path par le aana bhi bahut si lokkathaon kaa lakshya hota he
 The whole world comes to a level when the language of all living beings becomes one
 kahin manushya pashu se baat karata he to kahin pashu pakshi se
 All of them appear near each other in sorrow and happiness
 lokgeeton kii bhanti lokkathaayen bhi kisi seemaa ko sweekaar nahin karatin
 Let us talk about the circles, these stories have also crossed the boundaries of countries and continents
 in kathaon kii visheshta yah bhi he ki ye maanav jivan ke sabhi pahaluon se sampark rakhti hai
 In the collections of folktales here, very few stories have been found
 bhale hi ham unke sangrakshan kii baat karen parantu apni visheshtaon ke kaaran hi shruti evam smriti ke aadhaar par jivan praapt karanevaali ye kathaayen yugon se chali aa rahi hai
 These stories are told mainly in three genres
 pratham gadhy style; is prakaar main puri katha saral evam aanchalik boli main gadhy main kahi jaati he
 Second prose verse Maya stories - these can be called Champu style fiction
 aisi kathaon main praaia: maarmik sthalon par padya rachana milti hai
 In the third type of fiction, there is a flow in place of verse prose
 yah pravaah shrotaaon par acha asar daalata he kintu is main dwitiya prakaar kii kathaon ke padyon kii bhanti geyata nahin hoti, jaise : The snares are running, ek the paava kaudi Oo kauri ganga ka diha ganga vechaari baaluu dihini Ooo Balu i am Bhujwa's heart bhunjva bechaara dana dihesi - ityadi The person telling the story introduces the main character of the story in the first sentence itself; Like - "one raja" or "one raka" etc
 is visheshta ke kaaran lokkathaon kaa shrota vishesh uljhan main nahin padataa
 Along with telling the story in folklife, the style of listening to it has also been determined
 sunanevaalon main se koi vyakti, jab tak hunkaari nahin bharta tab tak katha kehane vaale ko anand hi nahin aata
 The narrator, even after listening to the hymn, understands that the listener is listening intently to the story

 Until the story ends, the characters and mainly the protagonists are seen trapped in such horrific events that the stories creep up
 kuch shrota to vahiin katha kahanevaale tath anya shrotaaon kii parvaah kiye bina nayak ko ksht denevaale ke naate apshabd bhi kehane lagate hai
 They find all these events to be correct

 saamaajik kahaniyon main ve kathaayen apana vishesh sthaan rakhti hai jinamein nayika mukhya rup se or nayak gaun rup se bhayanak parikshaayen dete hai
 Social and personal character is often given priority in such examinations
 jin nayak nayikaon ke charitra thik hote hai ve aisi kathor parikshaon main uteern hote dikhaai padate hai
 For example, when a woman with a saccharit puts her hand in a hot cauldron and tests her sattva, the hot oil of the cauldron becomes cold

 Diesel engine is an inhalation engine that generates fuel in the fuel using heat generated by compressing air in closed space
 is prakaar yah yah spark-jvalan injanon se bhinn he kyonki unamem vaayu or eendhan ke mishran ko prajvalit karne ke liye spark-plag kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is also called compression-ignition engine

 Due to this speed is gained which is used to do the desired work with the help of many gears and rails
 jab tak trakon, bason or rail injanon main deazal kaa prayog nahin shuru hua tab tak yah sarsaadhran ke liye agyaat hi tha
 Its other uses were equally important, but it did not seem so
 aaj deazal ingine jahaajon, janitron, pampo, sampidakon, chakkiyon, chattan dalitron, mitti hataane kii mashiinon, tractaron aadi main kaam aa rahaa he

 deazal ingine kaa jab janya injanon, jaise bhaap tarabine, gas tarabine athwa bhaap ingine se tulana karte hai tab deazal ingine kii utkrushtataa kaa pataa lagata he
 The engine has simplicity due to compression ignition
 indhan jalaane ke liye ingine main alag se upkaran jodne kii jhanjhat nahin rahati
 This makes the heat efficiency of such engines 36 percent, while the gas efficiency of the gasoline engine is only 25 percent, only 20 percent of the gas turbine and 12 percent of the reverse steam engine

 The earlier diesel engines were air-injected engines and very high pressure was used to fuel the engine cylinders
 san 1910 main james mackechnik ne thos injection pranali kaa vikaas kiya, jisamen saral, unche dabaavvaala eendhan-tel pump injection ke kaam main prayukt hua
 The difference between fuel-ignition-gasoline and compression-ignition-oil engines is in the nature of the fuel
 sphuling prajvalan ingine ke corburator main gasolin or hawa bilkul mila di jaati he or ingine ke silinder main, yah samroop mishran, bhaar chaahe jitna ho, die hue anupaat se pahunchaaya jaataa he
 The air-to-fuel ratio, called the air-fuel-ratio, remains constant at 14
5: 1 in a gasoline engine
 chunki deazal main hawa or eendhanvaale tel ke milaane kaa koi atirikt kaksh nahin hota, isliye milaane kaa kaam silinder main hi puraa karnaa padataa he
 Diesel always compresses a fixed amount of air, but there may be a difference in the amount of fuel dissolved depending on the burden
 yadi boj puraa he to vayuindhan kaa anupaat 22 : 1 rahata he
 If the engine does no work then the ratio is 85: 1
 deazal ingine ko gasolin ingine kii tulana main adhik maatra main hawa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Diesel engine consumes less fuel due to air-fuel-ratio and higher compression
 jitne eendhan se gasolin motor gaadi koi kaam karti he, utane hi eendhan main deazal motor gaadi duguna kaam karegi
 Another advantage of a diesel engine is that it can burn cheaper fuel and the fuel is less likely to fire
 dijal injanon kii dizine or aakaar na to europe main or na sanyukt rajya america, main hi 20veen shatabdi kii madhya tak maanakit hue the
 Diesel manufacturers made different types of diesel engines according to their interests and ideas
 is prakaar kai aakaaro, akritiyon or kai chaalon ke ingine bane hai
 The arrangement of the cylinders consists of a rudimentary shape in rows, ie, a v shape, with rival pistons, or a common action, or two actions
 do yaa chaar chakravaale injanon main sinlendar or stabhan alag alag, yaa ek hi khand main bane rahete hai
 There is a difference in air flow due to fuel gates and valve arrangement
 deazal kaa piston trunk yaa cross head prakaar kaa adhibhaarit tathaa ant:shitit, yaa isse rahit, ho saktaa he
 Various gases as fuel, such as natural gas, irradiation gas, producer gas, blast furnace gas, or sewage gas, various types of fuel oil, filled crude oil, light crude oil, light distilled oil, or both gas and oil are used
 Can occur
 vibhinn injanon main prakshubdh yaa purvahanakaksh, vaayu yaa urja cell prayukt hote hai, yaa ve khule kaksh kism ke hote hai
 Different shapes developed as a middle road, and each builder manufactured diesel with a view to use over a wide area
 deazal injanon kaa vargeekaran kai dhang se aayaa he, par samanay vargeekaran unki chaal par aadhaarit he
 An engine that rotates 1,200 or more per minute is called a high speed engine, which rotates 500 or less per minute is called a low speed engine and an engine with a speed between these two is the middle speed engine
 ucch chaal ingine chote bore, arthath 6 inch yaa isse bhi kam maap, ke hote hai, taaki ve aakaar or shakti utpaadan main gasolin ingine ke saath pratiyogita kar saken
 The cylinder is usually arranged in rows or in v shape
 uske sahaayak ang vidyut starter, tel pump, jal pump or shitalan tantra hai, jo ingine ke abhinn ang hi hote hai
 The engine rarely has a direct patented unit
 yadi prativartan kii aavashyaktaa ho to prativarti gear alag se jod diya jaataa he
 High-speed engines often contain ventilated air or energy cells to facilitate combustion
 piston ko thandha karne ke sahaayak ang kii kadachit hi koi vyavastha rahati he
 This type of engine develops a maximum of about 30 horsepower per cylinder and uses a lighter class of diesel oil as fuel
 deazal ingine chaar stroke, yaa do stroke chakra, par parichaalit hote hai
 This means that a four stroke cycle engine requires a full four stroke of the piston, or two revolutions of the crank shaft, while a two stroke cycle engine requires only two strokes, or only one rotation of the crank shaft
 
 chaar stroke chakra ingine ke nimnlikhit kaary hai : Ingestion - The entry valve opens and draws new air into the descending piston cylinder
 sampeedan - praveshwala valve band hota he or arohi piston silinder main hi hawa ko 500 pound prati varg inch ke dabaav se dabaata he
 Strength - Fuel is injected at the end of compression stroke
 yah turant swat: prajvalit ho jaataa he or tab failata he
 The force from the spread causes the piston to disengage
 nikaas - ab nikaas valve khul jaataa he or arohi piston jali hui gaison ko silinder ke baahar nikaal detaa he
 This cycle continues again and again
 do chakra mooka-sanmarjan ingine ke parichaalan ke kram main bhi antargrahan, sampeedan, shakti or nikaas kaary hote hai
 The descending piston opens the gateway and exit points
 isse apamarjak vaayu praveshmooka se silinder main pravesh karti he or silinder ko prakshalit kar nikaasmooka se nikal jaati he
 The ascending piston covers the entry and exit holes, and compresses the air in the cylinder, increasing the pressure, to about 500 pounds per square inch
 atitpt vaayu main ab idhan kaa ant:kshep hota he
 Fuel automatically rises and propagates, causing a stroke on the piston and forcing it down
 avarohi piston ab pravesh or nikasadwaron ko khol detaa he, jisase apamarjak sampeedit vaayu ko pravesh dwaar se pravesh karti or jali hui gaison ko silinder se nikasadwar dwaara nikaal detii he
 In this way the cycle is completed
 yadi do chakra ingine adarsh ho to ek hi vistaar or chaal ke chaar chakra ingine se duguni shakti praapt hogi, par vastav main aisa adarsh ingine nahin praapt hota
 The shock of a two-cycle engine is virtually less effective due to the cylinder itself
 The advantage of a two-cycle engine compared to a four-cycle engine is that a two-cycle engine is lighter for the same power output, with fewer parts
 And the texture is much simpler
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki bade ingine saadharantaya do chakravaale or chote chote ingine chaar chakravaale banaae jate hai
 But this rule is not always followed
