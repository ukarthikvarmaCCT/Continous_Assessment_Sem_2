 In early 1973, several spacecraft have demonstrated the skills of planetary flight, which brought them within the observation area of jupiter
 The Pioneer Mission obtained the first nearby images of Jupiter's atmosphere and their moons
 He found that the radiation field near the planet was more powerful than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in this environment
 The trajectory of this spacecraft was used to extensively refine the planetary system estimation
 The planet's covering of radio signals resulted in better measurement of Jupiter's diameter and polar flat amount

 It traveled 150 km from the parachute to the atmosphere, collected data for 57
6 minutes and was crushed by the pressure it was subjected to at the time
 After that it must have melted and possibly evaporated
 The Galilean vehicle also unfortunately experienced a similar rapid change when it was deliberately moved towards the planet on September 21, 2003 with a velocity of more than 50 km / s, a suicide move to a satellite
 To protect against any possible future accidents and possibly contamination, it has been the satellite, Europe - a moon with the possibility of harboring life

 Along with the Sun, Jupiter's gravitational effects have greatly helped shape the Solar System, with most planetary orbits located near the orbital plane of Jupiter rather than the equatorial plane of the Sun
 Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly due to Jupiter and the planet may be responsible for the lunar eclipse of the inner solar atmosphere

 The planet Jupiter was known since ancient times
 It is visible with the naked eye in the night sky and can sometimes be seen during the day when the sun is down
 From the Babylonian, this body is representative of their god Marak

 Additionally, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bishnupuria Manipuri, Romani and Urdu languages are also written in Devanagari in some cases
 devanagari vishwa main sarvaadhik prayukt lipiyon main se ek he

 The indications of many scripts in India and Asia are different from Devanagari, but the pronunciation and alphabet are the same as Devanagari, because they all originated from the Brahmi script
 isliye in lipiyon ko paraspar aasaani se lipyantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Devanagari is simple in terms of writing, beautiful in terms of beauty and legible in reading
 bhartiya ankon ko unki vaigyaniktaa ke kaaran vishwa ne saharsha sweekaar kar liya he
 The use of the name Devanagari or Nagari began with "why" and what was its etymological tendency - it is not yet completely certain
 'nagar' apbhransh yaa gujarati "nagar" brahmanon se uskaa sambandh bataaya gaya he
 But in the absence of strong evidence, this opinion is doubtful
 dakshin main iskaa pracheen naam "nandinagari" tha
 May be "nandinagar" is a locative and this script has something to do with it
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki "nagar" jan isamen likhaa karte the, at: "nagari" abhidhaan padaa or jab sanskrit ke granth bhi isamen likhe jane lage tab "devanagari" bhi kaha gaya
 Symbols or triangles, chakras, etc
 used in the worship of gods were called "devanagar"
 kalantar main naam ke prathamaksharon kaa unase bodh hone laga or jis lipi main unako sthaan mila- vah 'devanagari' yaa 'nagari' kahi gai
 At the core of all these aspects is the predominance of imagination, conclusive evidence is unavailable
 bharat devanagari lipi kii kshamta se shatabdiyon se parichit rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Dwarka Prasad Saxena, the first use of Devanagari script is found in the inscription of Naib Jayabhatta of Gujarat
 aathvin shatabdi main chitrakoot, naveen main baroda ke dhruvaraj bhi apane rajyadeshon main is lipi kaa upyog kiya karte the
 The Samagadha Tamrapat of Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga of 758 AD is found on which Devanagari is inscribed

 Its time is eleventh century, Cholaraja Rajendra coins of this time have been found on which the Devanagari script is inscribed
 rashtrakut raja indraraj ke lekh main bhi devanagari kaa vyavhaar kiya he
 The donation letter of Pratihara king Mahendrapal is also in Devanagari script

 brahmi or devanagari lipi : bhashaa ko lipiyon main likhane kaa prachlan bharat main hi shuru hua
 Sumerian, Babylonian and Greek people learned it from India
 prachinkaal main brahmi or devanagari lipi kaa prachlan tha
 Other scripts around the world originated from Brahmi and Devanagari scripts
 brahmi lipi ek pracheen lipi he jisase kai asian lipiyon kaa vikaas hua he
 Brahmi, like Kharoshthi, was spread throughout Asia
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki brahmi lipi 10,000 saal puraani he lekin yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah lipi usase bhi zyada puraani he
 Emperor Ashoka also adopted this script: The great emperor Ashoka named the Brahmi script as Dhammalipi
 brahmi lipi ko devanagari lipi se bhi pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is said to be a script derived from the ancient indus-saraswati script
 hadappa samskruti ke log sindhu lipi ke alaav is lipi kaa bhi istemaal karte the, tab sanskrit bhashaa ko bhi isi lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 In linguistic terms, Devanagari script is considered as alphabetic script
 lipi ke vikassopanon kii drushti se "chitratmak", "bhavatmak" or "bhavchitratmak" lipiyon ke ananthar "aksharatmak" str kii lipiyon kaa vikaas mana jaataa he
 The alphabetic state developed after the alphabetic state of the script due to the opinion of Westerners and many Indian linguists
 sabase viksit avasthaa maani gai he dhvanyatmak lipi kii
 "devanagari" is said to be alphabetical because its characters are letters - vowels and consonants
 "k", "kha" aadi vyanjan saswar hai- akaryukt hai
 They are not only sounds but are aloud
 at: greek, roman aadi varnmalas hai
 But here it is to be kept in mind that the "panini" of the consonants in the sounds of the "brahmi" or "bharati" alphabet of India has been explained by "patanjali" in the 14 formulas of Varnasammanaya
 Is that the use of the vowel "akaar" conjugated in consonants is for the purpose of pronunciation only
 vah tatvat: varna kaa ang nahin he
 Thinking from this point of view it can be said that the alphabet of this script is essentially phonetic, not alphabetic
 devanagari kii varnmaala main 12 swar or 34 vyanjan hai
 a letter is formed by a combination of zero or one or more consonants and a vowel
 nimnlikhit swar aadhunik hindi ke liye diye gayi hai
 Their pronunciation is slightly different in Sanskrit
 sanskrit main i do swaron kaa yugma hota he or "a-i" yaa "aa-i" kii tarah bolaa jaataa he
 Similarly, au is spoken like "a-u" or "a-u"
 iske alaava hindi or sanskrit main ye varnakshar bhi swar maane jate hai : When no vowel is used, 'A' is considered there
 swar ke na hone ko halant athwa viraam se darshaya jaataa he
 Such as KGGH
 hindi bhashaa main mukhyat: arabi or farsi bhashaaon se aaye shabdon ko devanagari main likhane ke liye kuch varnon ke neeche nukta lage varnon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 But in Hindi also most people do not use nuktas
 iske alaava sanskrit, marathi, nepali evam anya bhashaaon ko devanagari main likhane main bhi nukton kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Th is mainly used in the hill languages, as in Dogri the word for "tear" is "athru"
 hindi main d or dh vyanjan farsi yaa arabi se nahin liye gayi hai, na hi ye sanskrit main paye jaye hai
 In fact, they are the changed forms of ordinary s and d in Sanskrit
 devanagari ank nimna rup main likhe jate hai : In the Devanagari script, two consonants are spelled as follows: brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main devanagari lipi sabase adhik sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detii he
 Devanagari also supports conjuncts of more than 2 dishes
 chhandas font devanagari main bahut sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detaa he
 Some of the Devanagari characters used in earlier times are different from modern Devanagari
 1
kul milakar 403 tip hone ke kaaran tankan, mundran main kathinaayee
 2
 Use the outline for unnecessary embellishments
 3

 He had a clear belief that Devanagari script is the most scientific script in the world, not only in India
 agar bharat kii sab bhashaaon ke liye iskaa vyavhaar chal pade to saare bhartiya ek duusare ke bilkul najadik aa jaaenge
 In the unity of Hindustan, Devanagari script can be more useful than Hindi itself

 Seth Govindas was in favor of declaring it a national script
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki bharat main anekon bhashaayen hona koi samasya nahin he jabaki unki lipiyaan alag-alag hona bahut badi samasya he
 Gandhiji printed a Gujarati language book in Devanagari script in 1940 and stated that its dream is that every language emanating from Sanskrit should be scripted in Devanagari
 isi prakaar vinoba bhaave kaa vichaar tha ki- The area affected by Buddhist culture is not new to Nagari

 Due to the large number of these pictures, it is very difficult to learn the language
 devvani kii vahika hone ke naate devanagari bharat kii simaaon se baahar nikalakar china or japan ke liye bhi samuchit vikalp de sakati he
 People of Indian origin are familiar with Devanagari wherever they live in the world, especially people from Mauritius, Suriname, Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad, Tubago, etc
 is tarah devanagari lipi na keval bharat ke andar saare praantvaasiyon ko prem-bandhan main baandhakar simolanghan kar dakshin-purv asia ke puraane vrihattar bhartiya parivaar ko bhi ‘bahujan hitay, bahujan sukhaay‘ anupranit kar sakati he tathaa vibhinn deshon ko ek adhik sucharu or vaigyanik vikalp pradaan kar ‘vishwa nagari‘ kii padavi kaa daawa ikkisvin sadi main kar sakati he
 The spread on it will not be the medium of scriptural imperialism and exploitation but the conductor of lofty human values like truth, non-violence, renunciation, self-control, from unrest to sata, light from tamas and immortality from death
 duniya kii kai bhashaaon ke liye devanagari sabase acha vikalp ho sakati he kyonki yah yah bolne kii puri aazaadee detaa he
 This cannot happen in any other script of the world
 indonesia, vietnam, africa aadi ke liye to yahi sabase sahi rahegaa
 Looking at Ashtadhyayi, one can understand that there is no better script in the world
 agar duniya pakshpatarahit ho to devanagari hi duniya kii sarvamaanya lipi hogi kyonki yah purnat: vaigyanik he
 For effective solution of the spelling problem in English language, Deoghari script based on Devanagari has been proposed
 vistrut lekh devanagari kii vaigyaniktaa dekhen
 Just as the world accepted the Indian numerals due to their scientificness, Devanagari will one day become a world class due to its scientificness
 devanagari kaa vikaas us yug main hua tha jab lekhan haath se kiya jaataa tha or lekhan ke liye shilaayein, taadptr, charmpatr, bhojaptr, tamrapatr aadi kaa hi prayog hota tha
 But writing technology has developed a lot and through the printing press, typewriter etc
 it has reached the computer age where it has become possible to write even by speaking
 praudyogiki ke vikaas ke saath kisi bhi lipi ke lekhan main samasyaayen aana pratyaashit he
 For this reason, efforts were also made to improve or standardize from time to time in Devanagari

 The role of many institutional efforts has also been very important in the development of Devanagari
 1935 main hindi sahitya sammelan ne nagari lipi sudhaar samiti ke madhyam se barhakhadi or shirorekha se sambandhit sudhaar kiye
 Similarly, in 1947, a committee constituted under the chairmanship of Narendra Dev gave important suggestions related to twelvekhadi, quantity arrangement, anusvara and resonant

 The short circuit in an electrical circuit is one that allows the current to go through a path in which the impedance is zero or very low
 "khulaa circuit", laghu paripath kaa vaidyuthik vilom he jisamen vidyut paripath ke kinhi do binduon ke bich pratibaadha kaa maan anant hota he
 a short circuit is an unusually low resistive combination between two nodes in a power circuit that is determined for different voltages
 iske falswaroop atyadhik vidyut dhara bahati he jo baaki network ke thevenin ke samatuly pratirodh dwaara simit hota he
 a short circuit may cause circuit damage or overheating, fire, or explosion
 aise maamle bhi hai jahaan short circuit jaanboojhkar utpann kiye jate hai, jaise, crobaar circuit protectors main
 In case of short circuit, the current flowing from the source jahaan: In circuit analysis, the term short circuit is used to refer to a zero-impedance combination between two nodes in terms of analogy
 yah dono nodes ko ek hi voltage main bane rahane par jor detaa he
 In an ideal short circuit, this means neither a resistance is created in the short circuit nor there is a drop in voltage
 saral paripath vishleshan main, taron ko shorts ke arth main liya jaataa he
 In real circuits, this results in a connection of approximately zero impedance and almost no resistance
 aise maamle main, roke gaye karrent ko baaki ke circuit ke jariye simit rakhaa jaataa he
 a common type of short circuit occurs when the positive and negative terminals of a battery are connected to a conductor wire with very low resistance

 In electrical equipment, unwanted short circuits usually occur when the insulation of a wire is removed, or when another conductive material is used, which causes the electric charge to flow through a different path rather than flowing through its specified path
 Gets a chance to mukhya circuit main, do charnon ke bich, ek fez evam ek neutral ke bich athwa ek fez or arth ke bich laghu paripath ho sakate hai
 Such short circuits are more likely to result in very high current and therefore in such a situation, a large number of overflow protection devices are quickly activated
 haalanki, yah sambhav he ki tatasth or jameen conductor ke bich or ek hi charan ke do conductor ke bich short circuit ho jaae
 aise short circuit khatarnaak ho sakate hai, khaskar ye bade paimaane par vidyutpravaah main turant ghatit nahin hote or isliye avilamb pataa lagaae jane kii sambhaavna bilkul kam rah jaati he
 Possible effects include unexpected energetics of a circuit that was supposed to be isolated

 yah chaap, jo garm ynit plasma kaa ek channel he, atyadhik pravaahkeey he or conductor ke mahatvapurn mul padaarth ke vashpikrut ho jane ke baad bhi vidyaman rah sakate hai
 a typical sign of electric arc damage is surface erosion
 yahaan tak ki chote arches bhi electrode se ullekhneey maatra main padaarthon ko baahar nikaal sakate hai
 Low-voltage power lines use non-insulated wires, as they rely on the transfer of their circulating spaces to provide the necessary insulation

 To reduce this problem, Australia has started using aerial bundled conductors, in which the three-phase wire is insulated with the ground wire and wrapped back together
 ab khatarnaak sparks utpann nahin ho sakati hai
 By using fuses, circuit breakers, or other overload protection that disconnects the power as a result of excessive current, short circuit damage can be reduced or prevented

 An electric arc, if it is formed during a short circuit, produces high amounts of heat and may also be the cause of combustibility of combustible materials
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki electronics main, ek parichaalan pravardhak kaa adarsh model anant laabh) yah he ki yah apane input terminlon ke bich abhaasi short circuit kaa nirmaan karata he atah output voltage kuch bhi ho koi fark nahin padataa he, kyonki iske input terminlon ke bich kshamta kaa antar shunya rahata he
 If one input of one terminal is connected to the ground, it is assumed that the other provides a virtual land because its capacity is similar to that of the land
 ek adarsh parichaalan pravardhak main bhi anant input pratibaadha hoti he, atah asli short circuit ke vipareet, abhaasi terminal ke bich koi vidyutpravaah nahin hota he
 Because of these differences, the terminology can be confusing, referring to a textbook depiction that a "virtual open circuit" may be just as appropriate because no current flows

 Thermostats are typically used to control the flow of coolant in an air-conditioned emitter to an external heat sink to maintain the engine at its optimum working temperature in internal combustion engines
 is prakaar ke ooshmaatapi yantric rup se kaary karte hai
 They use wax pellets within a sealed chamber
 kam taapmaana par mom thos rahata he lekin ingine ke garm hone ke saath mom pighalta he or failata he

 zyada kushalta or kam pradooshan failaane ke chakkar main aadhunik ingine garm yani kii 80 °C se upar chalate hai
 Most of the thermostats have a small bypass hole to remove the gas involved in the system eg gas during replacement, which also allows a small flow of coolant to pass when the thermostat is closed
 yah upmargeey pravaah yah sunishchit karata he ki ingine ke garm hone ke saath ooshmaatapi shitalk ke taapmaana main parivartan ko anubhav karata he; iske bina ooshmaatapi ke aasapaas shitalk ke ek sthir kshetra ko dahan kakshon or silendar chhidron ke asann shitalk ke taapmaana parivartanon kii tulana main roak saktaa he
 During the thermostat's shutdown, the flow of coolant into the loop is very slow, which allows the coolant around the combustion chamber to heat up faster
 ooshmaatapi tab tak band rahata he jab tak ki shitalk kaa taapmaana ooshmaatapi ke khulne ke sankethik taapmaana tak nahin pahunch jaataa he
 The thermostat then opens slowly with an increase in the flow of coolant in the emitter reaching the optimum operating temperature of the coolant temperature

 If the pressure on the engine is increased by increasing the temperature of the cooling system, or by decreasing the coolant heat output, the vehicle speed decreases or the air temperature rises, the thermostat will open up by increasing the flow of coolant into the emitter
 The engine will be saved from overheating
 If the conditions are vomited, the thermostat will close slightly to maintain the temperature of the coolant

 a programmable thermostat would be of particular benefit to baseboard heaters that are capable of continuous control, effectively controlling the heaters such as lamp dimers and the constant control of the temperature of the chamber from the slowly increasing and decreasing heat
 tantra jinamein ek pankhaa shaamil he unhen vishesh taur par saadhaaran on / of niyantran kaa upyog karnaa hi chahie
 Depending on what to control, an artificial air-conditioned thermostat usually has an external switch for heating / closing / cooling and another on / auto switch that allows the air fan to be continuous or only Used to keep current when heating or cooling is running
 mukhya ooshmiya / thandak ikai se kendriya rup se sthit ooshmaatapi main chaar taar aate hai : ek taar ooshmaatapi ko 24 volt kii asi bijli sampark poorti karata he, jabaki duusare teen ooshmaatapi se niyantran sanket bhejte hai, ek garmi ke liye, ek thandak ke liye or ek hawa phenkane vaale pankhe ko chaalu karne ke liye
 The power supply is carried by a transformer and when the thermostat makes a connection between the power and another wire, a signal, returning to the heat / coolant unit, activates the unit's related function
 "thande" par sthir karne par ek ooshmaatapi keval tabhi chaalu hoga jab kamare ke parivesh kaa taapmaana tay taapmaana se adhik hoga
 So when the heating / cooling system is off, if the normal temperature of the controlled area is higher than the intended setting, it would make sense to keep the thermostat at "cool", regardless of the outside temperature
 duusari taraf agar niyantrit kshetra kaa taapmaana icchit degree se girtaa he to ooshmaatapi ko garm par rakhane kii salaah di jaati he
 a heat pump is a refrigeration-based device that reverses the cooling flow in the inside and outside coils
 ye ek pichley chhidr ko urjit karke kiya jaataa he 
 thanda karne ke dauraan bhitari coil ek vashpak hoti he jo bhitari hawa se garmi nikaalati he or ise bahari coil main sthanantarit karti he jahaan ise bahari hawa main nikaal diya jaataa he
 During heating, the outer coil becomes a vaporizer, and by removing heat from the outside air, the heat is transferred to the inner air with the help of the inner coil
 ooshmaatapi ke dwaara niyantrit ulton chhidr garmi ke thandak main parivartan ko utpann karata he
 Domestic heat pump thermostats typically have an "O" terminal to energize the opposite valve in the cold
 kuch ghannelu auki kai vanijyik ooshmaa pump, ooshmaatapi vipareet valve ko garmi main urjit karne ke liye "B" terminal upyog karte hai
 The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases with the outside temperature dropping
 kuch bahari taapmaana par prashithan tantra kii garmi ko imaarat main sthanantarit karne kii kshamta imaaraton kii garmi kii zarurat se neeche gir jaati he
 When the external temperature is below this equilibrium point, a specific heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat
 poorak garmi kaa kaary ooshmaa pump ooshmaatapi main ek dwitiya str ooshmak sampark dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 During heating, the outdoor coils operate below the external temperature and condensation may occur on the coils
 yah saghanta tab coil par jam sakati he, jisase isaki ooshmaa sthanantaran kshamta kam ho jaati he
 Therefore, in heat pumps, there is a provision of periodic snow removal from external coils
 ye thandak vidhi ke chakra ko ulta kar, bahari pankhe ko band kar or vidyuti ooshmak tatwon ko urjit kar kiya jaataa he
 In the melting method, electric heat is necessary for the system to keep the cool air inside the building
 ye tatv tab "punartaap" kaary karne main kaam aate hai
 Although the thermostat may indicate that the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the function of defrost is not controlled by the thermostat

 More expensive models have a PID controller built in, so that the thermostat knows how the system will behave next on its instructions
 udhaaharan ke liye usamen tay kar dena ki subah 7 baje kaa taapmaana 21 °C hona chahie ye nishchit karata he ki us samay taapmaana 21 °C hoga jabaki paaramparik ooshmaatapi us samay kaam karnaa shuru karegaa
 The PID controller decides at what time the system should be activated to achieve the desired temperature at the desired time
 in sabhi ko yah sunishchit karata he ki taapmaana bahut hi sthir he 
 Most digital thermostats in general residential use in North America and Europe are programmable thermostats that typically save 30 percent of energy when left with their original program; Adjustments to these basic programs can cut or increase energy savings
 kaarykramayogy ooshmaatapi lekh is tarah ke ek ooshmaatapi ke sanchaalan, chayan or sthapana par buniyadi jaankaree dete hai
 The thermostat should be away from the cooling or heating gates or appliances of the rooms, but nonetheless openness to normal airflow from the rooms should be regulated
 ek ekal jone tantra ke liye ek khulaa dalan sabase upyukt ho saktaa he jahaan baithken or shayankaksh ko ek ekal jone ke rup main sanchalit kiya jaataa he
 If the hallway is closed by doors from regulated areas, it should be left open when the system is in operation

 Thinking over the fact will be called a description of that object and its value is represented by its properties
 mulya vishyak nirnay vastu kii kisi adarsh se tulana karke kisi vyakti dwaara upasthit kiya jaataa he
 Values are the norm in all our experiences
 saundaryashastra main sundar-asundar kaa moolyankan, sangeet, sahitya or kala main maadhurya or sarasata kaa moolyankan or dharm main mulyon ke sangrakshan kaa praytn to sabhi ko sweekrut he kintu saath hi yah bhi dhyaan dene kii baat he ki achaarshastra, samajashaastra, arthshaastra, raajnneeti, vigyaan aadi main bhi mulyon kii samasyaon par hi vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The values of all these scriptures and sciences are not discussed separately under Valamimamsa, but the nature and nature of these universal values are considered

 Nevertheless, it can be said in general that just as the discourse of ethics focuses on right and wrong, in the same way, the discussion of value philosophy is often related to good and evil

 In the 19th century, evolutionary theory, sociology, psychology and economics underwent practical interpretation of values

 Under valuemotion, mainly the nature of value, the type of value, the price theory of value and the elemental distribution of value are studied

 Spinoza etc
 considered it to be the value that satisfies any desire
 epicuras, bentham, minang aadi sukhwadi darshanik sukh ko hi mulya maanate hai
 The nature of value is Parry's point of interest, preference for Martineau's view, a pure rational desire for Stike, Kant, and Royce, a general experience of personality for T
 H
 Green; Nietzsche and other evolutionists value the same experience that is somehow helpful in the development of life
 kuch darshanik jaise spinoja, lotz yaa divi aadi falwaadi mulya ko vyaktigat maanate hai
 It does not have independent power
 vah to vyakti kii ruchi, aruchi or uski maansik sthiti tathaa aavashyaktaaon par nirbhar karata he
 In contrast, leyards, moors etc
 consider the value of money as thematic like form, juice and smell

G
 Eyre has a logical sentimental view, so he calls the value meaningless
 mulya vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 They can be divided in many ways
 praaia: darshanik antarvarti or bahirvarti mulyon kaa bhed karte he
 The intrinsic value is independently priced for itself
 in mulyon ko paane kaa praytn isaliye nahin kiya jaataa ki unke dwaara kisi duusare uddeshy kii purti ho sakati he
 In fact, achieving these values is the ultimate goal
 bahyamoolya antarvarti mulyon kii prapti ke liye ek saadhan yaa yantra maatr hote hai
 On the one hand there are Vedantis who believe that Nirguna is the ultimate entity of the intrinsic value in the external form, in addition to that there are all the outlying values which are just misconceptions
 duusari ore aise falwaadi hai jo yantravaadi siddhant kaa samarthan karte hai or antarvarti mulyon kaa khandan karte hai
 Dualistic valuemasters assume the existence of both inward and outward values
 ek shaashvat hote he or duusare nashwar adhikansh darshanik isi siddhant ko thode bahut her pher se sweekaar karte hai
 Some give priority to inward values and consider outward values to be subordinate to them
 kuch log bahirvarti mulyon ko pradhanta dete hai or antarvarti mulyon ko bahirvarti mulyon kii utpatti yaa parinaam maanate hai
 There are also some philosophers who inevitably believe both types of value in all things
 ve yah nahin asweekaar karte ki kahin ek kii pradhanta hoti he to kahin duusare kii
 But there is no such item which has only pure intrinsic or absolutely outlying values
 saamaanya rup se shubh, satya, shiv, sundar or pavitra hi antarvarti mulya maane jate hai
 Some people also consider their social welfare, relationships, work and sports as intrinsic value
 manteg ke vichaar se satya ko sahi rup main mulya nahin mana ja saktaa, kyonki kuch satya moolyaheen hota he or kuch tatasth arthath usamen mulya hone na hone kaa prashn hi nahin hota
 There is a difference of opinion among philosophers regarding religious values as well
 kuch log use ek vishisht prakaar kaa mulya maanate hai or kuch log anya mulyon ke prati ek vishisht prakaar ke drushtikon ko hi dharmik mulya samajhate hai
 The measurement theory of value can be psychological and also logical
 sukhwadi darshanik mulya kii maap sukhanubhuti se karte hai
 Erestipus considers the value of the happiness of the individual and the happiness of the Bentham society as the criteria
 bentham ne aise sukhganak kii khoj kii thi jisamen sukh kii gahanta, sthayitv, nischitata, nikatatv, upyogita, pavitrataa vyaapkatv aadi ke ank nirdhaarit kar sukh ko mapa ja saktaa he
 It is a psychological attempt to measure value
 martenu or brentanon antadrushti se mulya kii maap sambhav samajhate hai
 Some spiritualists have set objective ideals and compare them to measure values
 kuch darshanik samshti or saamanjasy main hi mulya kaa gunavdhaaran uchit batalaate hai
 Naturalist philosophers consider biological evolution and adjustment to the environment as a measure of value
 jis vastu, kriya yaa paristhiti main jeev kaa vikaas adhik drut gati se hota he uskaa adhik mulya he iske vipareet jinase jivan main baadha upasthit hoti he, unako mulya nahin diya jaataa
 When determining the elemental value of a value, its relation to the modality is determined
 yadi mul tatv sat he to mulya kaa usase kya sambandh he? is sambandh main mukhyat: teen siddhant hai---vyaktivaadee, taarkik vastuvaadi or tathvik vastuvaadi
 Individualists consider the value associated with and dependent on human experience
 mulya vyakti ke man kii hi utpatti he
 He is not concerned with the object
 vyakti apni paritripti ke anusaar vastu main mulya kaa aropan karata he
 "" Prio-beloved Upekshashyatyakara Manigrasya: Creator Jivarayasrishtharan Roopam Ordin Mishu "" Dear, unpleasant and neglectable gem has three shapes resurrected and its simple form is God created
 priy, apriy or upeksha bhav vyakti vyakti main bhinn hone ke kaaran nishchay hi vyakti ke man kii rachanaayen hai
 Sukhists, sentimentalists and naturalists also support similar views
 vastuvaadi is siddhant kaa khandan karte hai
 They do not consider value to be just a mental creation
 mulya kaa vastu main swatantra astitv he
 The person does not recognize that value, yet he preserves his existence
 sabhi vastuvaadiyon kaa ek mat nahin hai
 Some objectivists do a logical analysis of value and are called logical objectivists
 kuch vastuvaadi tathvik drushti se mulya kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 They can be called elemental objectivists
 taarkik vastuvaadi mulya ko maanas rachana na maanane ke kaaran use ek saar yaa dravya maanate hai
 He does not have any independent power even while in the object which can have any effect or change on the object or truth
 yahan sat or mulya main spasht bhed rakhaa jaataa he
 Elementalists accept the elemental reality of architectural value and consider it a part of that truth
 madhya himalay yaa laghu himalay himalay parvat tantra kii ek shrenee he jo mahaan himalay ke dakshin main or shivalik shrenee ke uttar main sthit he
 It is known regionally by many names such as Dhauladhar Range in Kumaon, Mahabharata Range in Nepal etc

 Two major valleys lie between the Central Himalayas and the Great Himalayas, the Kashmir Valley to the west and the Kathmandu Valley to the east

 yahan tak ki ise tyohaaron kii samskruti kahana galat nahin hoga
 There is a festival or festival going on throughout the year

 Some festivals are celebrated in a region, while some may have different names across India

 Much of the contributions to Quail's presumption of incompetence were either themselves contradictory and the Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history ", impossible and confusing or just one whose slogan is the United Negro College Fund, when addressed as" confused "and Said, "you are to ease it or someone's mind
 What a waste that the UNCF model does not take is a mind being very useless

 ICC tournament australia cricket team kaa bharat daura Template: This article is about when a product is launched in the market as compared to a brand name, if it is launched with a brand name, then the effect it has on marketing or the extent to which its result in the market changes the brand Equity says the root cause of this effect on product marketing is the knowledge of consumers
 In other words, consumers' knowledge about the brand prompts manufacturers / advertisers to respond differently or adopt absolutely accurate and efficient tips for marketing the brand
 brands equity kaa adhyayan bahut tezi se lokapriy ho rahaa he, kyonki kuch shodhakartaaon ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki kisi bhi company ke liye uski sabase mahatvapurn sampatti he, uskaa brands
 There are many ways to measure a brand
 maapan ke kuch tareeke vyavsaay ke str par hote hai, kuch utpaada ke str par or anya upabhokta ke str par hai
 Business level: The brand is measured as a financial asset in a business level manner
 sankshep main, is baat kii gananaa hoti he ki amoort sampatti ke rup main is brands kaa kya mulya he
 For example, if you want to measure the value of a business, the value of the market according to its capital - by subtracting tangible assets and "measurable" intangible assets from it - the remainder that will be brand equity
 a high-level example of measurement at the business level is the interbrand consulting of businesses
 To calculate this, it is estimated by Interbrand that what the brand value will be based on the present value compared to the sponsored profit
 The discount rate is a subjective rate determined by interbrand Wall Street equity experts and reflects the level of risk, market leadership, stability and global reach of the brand
 utpaada str : utpaada str ke brands maapan kaa ek adarsh udhaaharan he ek bina naam ke yaa nijee label vaale utpaada ke mulya kii tulana bilkul 'usee gunvattta ke' branded utpaada ke mulya se karnaa
 sabhi chizein saamaan hone ke baavjood keemat main antar uske brands kii vajah se hota he
 Recently an income premium approach has been advocated
 upabhokta str : is tareeke se upabhokta ke dimag ko padhakar ye pataa kiya jaataa he ki kin kaarnon kii vajah se vah us vishisht brands se judaa he
 In this way awareness and brand image are measured
 brands ke moort or amoort gun, drushtikon or iraade pahchaanane ke liye mukt rup se judaav pareekshan or prayojan takneekon kaa prayog aamtaur par kiya jaataa he
 Brands that have high awareness and have strong, friendly and unique connections with consumers are high-equity brands
 ye sabhi gananaaen sarvshereshth tareeke se karne par bhi lagbhag main hi parinaam detii hai
 It is more effective to use several of these methods together to create a better and complete understanding of the brand
 ek dilachasp sawaal uthaaya jaataa he - kya brands equity nakaaratmak ho sakati he? ek pariprekshya se, brands equity nakaaratmak nahin ho sakati
 sakaaratmak brands equity prabhavi marketing, vigyaapan, jansampark or prachaar dwaara banaai jaati he
 a second perspective is that there can be negative equity
 agar ek rajnatik "brands" ke udhaaharan ko dekhen to "democrate brands' ek 'republican' ke liye nakaaratmak ho saktaa he or isi tarah ek 'democrate' ke liye 'republican' brands nakaaratmak equity vaala ho saktaa he
 The higher the brand equity of a company, the more likely it is that the family branding strategy will be used more than the individual branding policy
 This is because family branding allows them to further improve the equity accumulated in the major brand
 brands equity ke pahaluon main shaamil hai: brands ke prati nishtha, jaagrukta, judaav or uski gunvattta ke bare main logon kii dharna
 In North America in the early 2000s, Ford Motor Company made a policy decision that they would name all of their new and redesigned cars, starting with the English letter 'F'
 This is tied to the already ongoing tradition of introducing the English name 'E', the initial name of all Ford Explorer vehicles, useful in sports

 puraani toras joki america auto itihaas main sabase mahatvapurn car ban chuki thi use 'fif' se shuru hone vaale teen bilkul nae naam - five handred, freestar or fusion se badal diya janaa tha
 By 2007, it was discontinued without a replacement for Freestar
 five handred naam ko hataa diya gaya or agali peedi ke kaaron ke liye toras ko waapas laayaa gaya ye nirnay aakasmik rup se ellen muleli ne liya
 "five Hundred" was recognized by less than half of the majority of people while "ford Taurus" had the majority

 karn gangaji main bahata hua ja rahaa tha ki maharaj dhritarashtra ke sarathi adhirath or unki patn radha ne use dekha or use god le liya or uskaa laalan paalan karne lage
 From a very young age, Karna was more interested in warfare than in chariot like his father Adhirath
 karn or uske pita adhirath acharya dron se mili jo ki us samay yudhkala ke sarvshereshth aacharyon main se ek the
 Dronacharya used to teach Kuru princes at that time
 unhone karn ko shiksha dene se manaa kar diya kyonki karn ek sarathi putr tha or dron keval kshatriyon ko hi shiksha diya karte the
 After Dronacharya's dissent, Karna approached Parasurama, who used to teach only Brahmins
 karn ne swayan ko brahman bataakar parashuram se shiksha kaa aagrah kiya
 Parashurama accepted Karna's request and mastered Karna in the same manner of warfare and archery
 karn ko uske guru parashuram or prithvi mata se shraap mila tha
 Karna's education was in its final stages
 ek dopaher kii baat he, guru parashuram karn kii jangha par sir rakhkar vishram kar rahe the
 After some time a scorpion came from somewhere and bitten on his other thigh and started making wounds
 guru kaa vishram bhang naa ho isliye karn bichchhu ko dur naa hataakar uske dank ko sahataa rahaa
 In some time Guruji's sleep broke and he saw that a lot of blood was flowing from Karna's thigh
 unhonen kaha ki keval kisi kshatriya main hi itani sahansheeltaa ho sakati he ki vah bichchhu dank ko sah le, naa ki kisi brahman main or parashuramji ne use mithyaa bhaashan ke kaaran shraap diya ki jab bhi karn ko unki di hui shiksha kii sarvaadhik aavashyaktaa hogi, usadin vah uske kaam nahin aegi
 Karna, who himself did not know from which clan he was, apologized to his guru and said that if he had another disciple in his place, he would have done the same
 yadhyapi karn ko krodhvash shraap dene par unhen glani hui par ve apana shraap waapas nahin le sakate the
 Then he gave Karna his bow called Vijay and blessed him that he would get what he wanted most - indelible fame
 kuch lokkathaon main main mana jaataa he ki bichchhu ke rup main swayan indra the, jo uski vaastavik kshatriya pahchaan ko ujagar karnaa chaahate the
 After Parashuramaji left the ashram, Karna wandered for some time
 is dauraan vah 'shabdabhedi' vidya sikh rahaa tha
 During the practice, he considered the calf of a cow to be an endemic animal and shot a waggon at him and the calf was killed
 tab us gaay ke swami brahman ne karn ko shraap diya ki jis prakaar usne ek asahaay pashu ko maaraa he, vaise hi ek din vah bhi maaraa jayega jab vah sabase adhik asahaay hoga or jab uskaa sara dhyaan apane shatru se kahin alag kisi or kaam par hoga
 In this way Karna became an extremely hard working and accomplished disciple of Parashurama
 karn duryodhana ke aashray main rahata tha
 Guru Dronacharya organized a rangbhoomi in Hastinapur on completion of the education of his disciples
 rangabhumi main arjuna vishesh dhanurvidya yukt shishy pramanit hua
 Then Karna came to Rangbhumi and crossed the tricks done by Arjuna and challenged him to a duel
 kab kripacharya ne karn ke dwandvayuddh ko asweekrut kar diya or usase uske vansh or samrajya ke vishay main poocha - kyonki dwandvayuddh ke niyamon ke anusaar keval ek rajkumaar hi arjuna ko, jo hastinapur kaa rajkumaar tha, dwandvayuddh ke liye lalkaar saktaa tha
 Then Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, declared Karna as Angaraja so that he would be eligible for a duel with Arjuna
 jab karn ne duryodhana se poocha ki vah usase iske badale main kya chahta he, tab duryodhana ne kaha ki vah keval ye chahta he ki karn uskaa mitra ban jaae
 After this incident, some of the main relations of the Mahabharata were established, such as a strong relationship between Duryodhana and Karna, intense rivalry between Karna and Arjuna and estrangement between the Pandavas and Karna
 karn, duryodhana kaa ek nishthavan or sachcha mitra tha
 Although he later participates in Dutikrida to please Duryodhana, he was against it from the beginning
 karn shakuni ko pasand nahin karata tha or sadaiv duryodhana ko yahi paramarsh detaa ki vah apane shatruon ko parrast karne ke liye apane yuddh kaushal or baahubal kaa prayog kare naa ki kutil chaalon kaa
 When the attempt to kill the Pandavas at the Lakshgriha fails, Karna scolds Duryodhana for his cowardice and says that all the tricks of the cowardly fail and convince him that he should act like a warrior and he Whatever you want to achieve, get it through your bravery
 chitrangad kii rajkumaari se vivaah karne main bhi karn ne duryodhana kii sahaayta kii thi
 In his swayamvara he rejected Duryodhana and then Duryodhana took him by force
 tab vahaan upasthit anya raajaaon ne uskaa peechha kiya, lekin karn ne akele hi un sabko parrast kar diya
 The defeated kings were Jarasandha, Shishupala, Dantavakra, Salve and Rukmi etc
 karn kii prashansa swaroop, jarasandh ne karn ko magadh kaa ek bhaag de diya
 Bhima later defeated Jarasandha with the help of Sri Krishna but long before that Karna defeated him alone
 karn hi ne jaraasandh kii is durbalata ko ujagar kiya tha ki uski mrityu keval uske dhad ko pairon se cheer kar do tukdo me baant kar ho sakati he

 The most popular among these Pahadia fighters is the Adividrohi Jabra or Zaurah Pahadia aka Tilka Manjhi
 zebra pahadiya bharat main british satta ko chunauti dene vaale pahadiya samudaay ke vir adivasee the
 Jabra Pahadia alias Tilka Manjhi of Singarsi Pahar, Pakur, is said to have been born on 11 February 1750 AD
 1771 se 1784 tak unhone british satta ke viruddh lambii or kabhi na samarpan karne vaali ladaai ladi or sthaneey mahajanon-saamanton va angreji shaasha kii neend udaae rakhaa
 Among the Pahariya fighters are Sardar Ramna Ahadi and Kariya Pujhar, resident of Amagachhi Pahar in Amdapada block and Jabra Pahadia, resident of Singarsi Pahar, are Adivasis of India
 duniya kaa pehla adividrohi rome ke purakhaa adivasee ladaaka spartacas ko mana jaataa he
 While in the history of India's colonial wars, the credit for being the first Adivasi goes to the fighters of the Pahariya primitive tribal community who fought the British rule in the hills of Rajmahal, Jharkhand
 in pahadiya ladaakon main sabase lokapriy adividrohi zebra yaa jorah pahadiya urf tilka maanjhi hai
 In 1778, he joined the Pahariya chieftains and drove out the British who captured the Ramgarh camp and liberated the camp
 1784 main zebra ne cleveland ko maar daalaa
 Later Jabra's guerrilla army led by Eyrkut suffered a tremendous attack in which several fighters were killed and Jabra was arrested
 kehete hai unhen chaar ghodon main baandhakar ghasitate hue bhagalpur laayaa gaya
 But despite being dragged for miles, the Pahariya fighter was alive
 khun main dubi uski deh tab bhi gussell thi or uski laal-laal ankhen britani raaj ko daraa rahi thi
 Trembling with fear, the British then hanged themselves on a huge tree tree at the crossroads of Bhagalpur and killed them
 hajaaron kii bheed ke saamne zebra pahadiya urf tilka maanjhi hansate-hansate faansee par jhul gaye
 The date was probably 13 January 1785

! - vah aaj bhi hamen is adividrohi kii yaad dilaate hai
 This guerrilla warrior of the Pahadia community is a legend about which historical documents mention only names, and do not give complete details
 lekin pahadiya samudaay ke purakhaa geeton or kahaniyon main isaki chhapamar jeevani or kahaniyaan sadiyon baad bhi uske adividrohi hone kaa akatya daawa pesh karti hai
 Was Tilka Manjhi Santal or Pahadia a dispute about it

 The Annals of Rural Bengal, Volume 1, 1868 by Sir William Wilson Hunter clearly states that Santal people lived from Birbhum towards today's Singhbhum
 1790 ke akaal ke samay unka migration aaj ke santal pargana tak hua
 Hunter wrote, 'from 1792 onwards, new history begins'

 There are also Manjhi in the schools and due to the large population and Hul of 1855 they became more known, hence the confusion of Tilaka Manjhi alias Jabra Pahadia being a tribal tribal spread

 By the way, 'tilaka' in Pahadia language means a person with angry and red-red eyes

 When, in the scorching heat of 1858, amidst the heat of the heat, Rani Lakshmibai, the heroine of Jhansi and her worthy army heroes, Rao Sahib and Tatya Tope, all set out in the maidan-e-jung of Gwalior to wage war against the British
 us samay jhaansi kii rani kii sena or gwalior ke vidrohi sainikon ko kai maheenon se vetan tathaa rashan aadi kaa samuchit prabandh na ho paane se sankaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 At such a time of the country, Amarchand Banthiya went ahead and handed over the entire treasury of Gwalior to the rebels at the behest of Queen Laxmibai
 rajasthan kii raajaputaani shaury bhoomi bikaner main shahid amarchand banthia kaa janm 1793 main hua tha
 He had the passion to do something for the country from the beginning
 balykaal se hi unhone thaan rakhaa tha ki desh kii aan-baan or shaan ke liye kuch kar guzarana he
 Self in history Not much is known about Amarchand, but the father's occupational loss is said to have forced the Banthia family to migrate from Rajasthan to Gwalior and the family settled in the bullion market
 gwalior kii tatkaaleen sindhiya riyasat ke maharaj ne unki kirti se prabhavit hokar unhen rajkosh kaa koshadhyaksh bana diya
 At that time the Gangajali treasury of Gwalior was secretly safe, which was known only to a select few

 In fact, he was not only a keeper of the treasury but also a knower

 The Swatantra Summer of 1857 was in its full youth, but unfortunately the erstwhile Scindia princely state was a friend of the British
 kintu adhikariyon main aksar is vishay main charchaa hua karti thi
 One day one officer told Amar Chand Banthia ji, who believed in Jainism, that in order to free Bharat Mata from slavery, now you too should leave Ahimsa and take up arms
 banthia ji ne kaha ki bhai main hathiyaar to nahin uthaa saktaa, kintu ek din samay aane par aisa kaam karuunga jisase kranti ke pujaariyon ko madad milegi
 Then Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi got the right over Gwalior and the allied rulers of the British were forced to withdraw from there

 Due to the sense of independence, summer was seen dying
 is sthiti ko dekhte hue banthia ji ne apni jaan kii parvaah na kar krantikariyon kii madad kii tathaa gwalior kaa rajkosh unke supurd kar diya
 He made this money available on 8 June 1858

 Four days after Veerangana was martyred, Shri Amarchand Banthiya was hanged in public on the neem tree in Sarafa Bazar, near his place of residence for treason

 If the name of Gwalior is written in the golden letters in the 1857 revolution, only because of the incomparable sacrifice story of Hutatma Amar Chand Banthia

 vah poloroid instent camera ke photographs evam chirsthayee tatuge ke jariye hatya kaa badla lene kii koshish karata he
 Aamir Khan's character will get a special place in a 3-D video game titled Ghajini the Game, which is based on this film
 is film kii kahani medical chaatra sunita or uski sahpathine jo uske saath maanav-mastishk kii ek pariyojna par kaam kar raheen hai, se khulti he
 He wants to investigate the unique condition of Sanjay Singhania, the city's designated trader who suffers from post-operative memory loss
 uske professor sanjay ke abhilekhan tak abhigaman se asweekaar kar dete hai kyonki vartmaan main uske saare aapraadhik tathyon kii jaanch jari he
 Despite this, Sunita decides to conduct the investigation herself
 sanjay ko ek duusare vyakti kii krurta se hatya karata hua pesh kiya jaataa he
 He takes a picture of the person and places the 'executed' seal in his note with the time and date
 aisa darshaya gaya he ki sanjay ko ghatanottar smriti lop kii ek ajeebogareeb beemaari he jisamen uski yaaddaasht har 15 minute ke baad mit jaati he
 Sanjay uses the methods of tattooing, taking notes, and tattooing on his body to return his memory again after every 15-minute cycle
 har subah jab sanjay shauchalay jaataa he, vah vaash basin main nal kii tonti ke paas hi "kameez utaaro" likhaa hua ek note dekhtaa he
 As he takes off the shirt, he sees a series of tattoos on his wide chest
 jab vah "kalpana kii hatya kar di gai thi" guda hua dekhtaa he to ek sire se yah udghaatit ho jaataa he ki sanjay antat kalpana kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye pra tibaddh he or isiilie vah pariklpit tareeke se ek-ek kar un logon ko maar rahaa he jo kalpana kii maut ke jimmedaar the
 The written notes and the pierced tattoos provide clear evidence that its main target is Ghajni
 aakhirkaar yah bhi saafe-saafe jaahir ho jaataa he ki gajani or koi nahin balki shahar kaa ek prasiddh saamaajik vyaktitv he
 Mumbai Police Inspector Arjun Yadav is involved in the investigation of the case related to serial murders
 vah sanjay kaa pataa lagaate hue use uske flats main khoj nikaalte hai or usapar hamalaa kar use apahiz kar dete hai
 Arjun Yadav is surprised to see the extensive set of photographs and written notes
 unhen aisi do diariyaan milteen hai jinamein 2005 or 2006 kii ghatnaon ko kram se lipibaddh kiya gaya he
 The film enters the pre-2005 scene as soon as Inspector Yadav reads the 2005 diary
 sanjay singhania ek pratishthit vyapaaree vansh kaa vyakti he jo air voyas telephone company kaa maalik he
 He has finished his education abroad and returned to take over his family business
 apane kaarobaar ke dauraan sanjay apane karmchaariyon ko ek jujharu abhinetri / model kalpana se milane evam uske apartment ke upar air voyas kaa vishaal vigyaapan board lagane ke bare main baatcheet karne ke liye bhejtaa he
 The owner of Kalpana's modeling / advertising company forgets to think of it as a romance affair and encourages Kalpana to accept the proposal
 vah pramukh model ke rup main uski padonnati kar detaa he
 Kalpana is usually sweet and kind
 vah ise bataur ek maasoom sharaarat karne ke liye sweekaar kar leti he or is prakaar sanjay ke garlfriend ke rup main paheliyon se bharaa naatakeey khel shuru karti he
 Sanjay finally meets Kalpana but he tells him that he is Sachin and is an Adana human who has come from a small town to a big city in search of new life
 kalpana use modling ke chote-mote kaam dilaati he
 Slowly she is drawn towards him in his hypnosis and Sachin also gets swept away in her mildness, simplicity and compassion
 unhen ek duusare se pyaar ho jaataa he or sanjay ko antat usase shaadi kaa prastaav pesh karne kii himmat ho jaati he
 She asks for some time to consider his proposal
 sanjay sthir karata he ki agar vah uske prastaav ko sweekaar kar leti he to vah apni asli pahchaan uske saamne ujagar kar degaa; or agar vah asweekaar karti he, to vah chupchaap bina koi haani pahunchaae waapas laut jayega
 The film's story then returns to the present; When Yadav starts reading the 2006 diary
 sanjay achaanak aa jaataa he, yadav par hamalaa kar detaa he or use baandh detaa he
 He discovers Ghazni at a college function where he is the honorable head guest
 sanjay gajani ke kuch chayachitr letaa he or use jaan se maar daalane kaa faisla karata he 
 usee samaaroh main uski mulaaqaat sunita se ho jaati he; vah bhi uske file par lage cover se use pahchaan leti he or usase dosti karne kaa iraadaa karti he
 Later that same evening, Sanjay kills a goon of Ghazni in the parking area
 vah gajani ke aane kaa intjaar karne lagata he lekin ant main usapar phir kabhi kisi or maukey par aakhri hamalaa karne kaa faisla karata he
 The dying injured Gunda reminds Ghazni of an incident that took place two years ago in which Kalpana was murdered and Sanjay became a patient after being hurt
 gajani asamanjas main pad jaataa he or kuch bhi yaad kar paane main naakaam ho jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Sunita comes to Sanjay's flat and finds Yadav beaten and tied
 use is baat kaa pataa bhi lag jaataa he ki gajani hi sanjay kaa nishaanaa he
 Yadav also informs him that Sanjay is a known serial killer
 sunita ke haathon do diariyaan lag jaatin hai or vah yadav ko aaazaad kar detii he
 Suddenly in the meantime Sanjay reaches there He does not remember any of them and walks out chasing them
 antatogatva yadav ek bas se takaraa jaataa he or sunita badi mushkil se sanakee sanjay se batch nikalati he
 Knowing that Ghajni is in danger, she informs him that it is Sanjay who is behind his life
 is naam ko lakshya banaakar pataa lagaataa hua gajani sanjay ke flats main uski hatya ke iraade se pahunch jaataa he
 He destroys all her photographs and notes and gets her goons overpowered by Sanjay and re-inducts her on her existing tattoo so that all the marks that mark old memories are erased
 All traces connecting with old memories of being restless have been erased, leaving Gajni Sanjay in this condition
 is bich, chatravaas main lautakar sunita 2006 kii diary padhati he
 The film's story then returns to the pre-2006 scene
 aisa dikhaaya jaataa he ki kalpana ne sanjay ke vivaah prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 This diary also ends abruptly
 sunita or aage chaanbin kar pataa lagaati he or yah khoj nikaalati he ki 2006 main kisi padaav par kalpana anjaane main anachaahe hi veshyavriti karwaane waalon ke bure jaal main ulajh gai thi
 During the train journey, he met 25 innocent Bholi Bhali Kamsin girls who were being sent to Mumbai for business
 vah un ladakiyon kii raksha kar unka uddhaar karti he
 But the girls take Ghajni's name as gang gangsters
 gajani apane tareeke se apane madhyamon kaa prayog ladakiyon kii jubaan band karne ke liye karata he or kalpana ko khud khoj nikalne ke liye nikal padataa he
 Ghazni and his goons sabotage into Kalpana's apartment and wait for her to return while Kalpana is found inside
 sanyogvash, sanjay vahaan kalpana se milane pahunch gaya
 Kalpana's last pronounced word was "ghajini"
 The goons attacked Kalpana
 sanjay hastkshep karne hi vaala tha ki achaanak gajani ne lohe kii chad se uske sir par aghat kar diya
 The final scene flashes in front of Sanjay's eyes, that Kalpana was killed by the brutal assault of Ghazni's iron rod
 sunita ko ab sadma vaali sachai kaa pataa chal jaataa he, vah sanjay se mulaaqaat karti he or use bataati he ki sach kya he
 Uncontrollable with anger, he pursues Ghazni zealously
 mumbai main gajani kii maand main pahunchakar sanjay gajani ke sabhi anuchar gurgon ko ek-ek kar baqayada suniyojit dhang se krurtapurvak maar daalata he or gajani ke peeche pil padataa he
 Furiously repulsed, he approaches her and confronts the fight
 vah gajani ko maarna hi chahta he ki uskaa smriti lop chakra phir gum jaataa he or vah vartmaan ko bhul jaataa he
 Ghazni turns and stabs him
 vah sanjay kaa mazaaq udaate hue vibhats ghinauni kahani sunaata he ki usne kaise kalpana kii hatya kii thi, tabhi achaanak apni takat kaa antim ubaal paakar sanjay gajani ko kaabo main kar letaa he
 Sanjay kills Ghazni in the same way that Ghajni murdered Kalpana
 film apni samaapti kii ore badhati he, sanjay abhi bhi apni smriti-lop kii beemaari se grasit ek anathalay main swanyasevak ke rup main kaam kar rahaa he
 Sunita gives him a small gift that marks Sanjay and Kalpana's footsteps on the plaster plate when they entered a new apartment - only to remind him of his intimate companionship with Kalpana
