 Although, for thousands of years, various beliefs about insanity have existed, psychologist and philosopher Karl Jaspers was the first person who in his book 'general Psychopathology', written in 1917, outlined three major criteria for declaring a belief as illusion
 ye maandand hai: These criteria still apply to modern diagnoses of psychiatry today
 abhi haal hi main prakashit 'diaganaustic and statistical manual of mental disorders' main di gayi bhram kii paribhaasha kuch aisi he: However, there is a dispute over the definition that 'it takes place beyond the belief of everyone else' implies that if a person believes an assumption which most of the others do not believe, then that person is in the grip of a misleading idea
 
 iske alaava, yah vidambana hi he ki, uparokt teen mandandon kaa shrey jaspers ko diya jaataa he, par unka khud kaa kahana he ki ve maandand 'aspasht' or keval 'bahya-rupi' hai
 He has also written that, since the real or "internal" criterion of delusion can be known from the primary experience of delusion and the change in personality, the illusion, despite the illusion, can be correct about the subject: as - World War is taking place
 ' Delusions are categorized into two classes, absurd or argumentative and mood-conforming or mood-neutral
 in vargikarnon ke alaava, bhram akasar susangat vishay ke anuroop hote hai
 Although confusion can occur in any subject, there are some topics on which it is common to have confusion
 aam taur par hone vaale bhramon ke vishay hai: The modern definition and the basic criteria of Jaspers have been criticized, as unfavorable examples of every defined situation can also be found
 maansik taur par aswasth rogiyon par kiye adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki samay ke saath-saath bhramon kii tivrata or vishwaas kii dridhtaa main her-fer hone lagata he jisase yah sanket miltaa he ki ye zaruri nahin he ki nischitata or sudhaarney main asambhavata, ye donon bhramit karne vaali dharanaon ke ghatak hon
 It is not necessary that the illusion is a misnomer or a 'miscalculation of external truth'
 Some religious and spiritual beliefs cannot be denied because of their naturalness and hence they cannot be called untrue or even false, whether the person who believes in these beliefs is a victim of confusion or not
 baaki paristhitiyon main bhram ek sachcha vishwaas ho saktaa he
 For example, the illusion of jealousy, in which the confused person believes that their spouse is unfaithful to them or has been, as a result, the loyal and unhappy spouse due to the constant and unreasonable stress exerted by their confused partner
 It can take off if done
 aise maamle main jab aage chalakar baat sach nikalati he to bhram, bhram nahin rah jaataa
 In other cases, doctors or psychiatrists investigating delusions may misunderstand the delusion, because they think such an absurd or superfluous belief is impossible
 manochikitsakon ke paas na to itnaa samay hota he na hi saadhan ki ve bhramit vyakti kii baton kii satyata kii jaanch-parakh kar saken ki kahin galati se asli vishwaas ko bhram kaa rup na diya gaya ho

 R
 Critics such as D
 Laying said that the diagnosis of delusions by such definitions is based on the subjective understanding of the psychiatrist and that the psychiatrist may not have all the information from which the illusion can be interpreted
 R
 D
 Laying's hypothesis has been applied in some forms of projective medicine to "confine" the illusion system so strongly that the patient cannot make any changes to it
 Researchers at Yale University, Ohio State University and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used psychiatrists as novels and films

 The fictional scenes of this novel discuss other novels of author Farmer and his characters are symbolically added to the illusion of fictional patients
 uske baad, is vishesh upanyaas kaa prayog asli jivan ke chikitsiya halaaton main kiya gaya
 Another difficulty in diagnosing delusions is that almost all symptoms of delusions are found in "normal" beliefs
 anek dharmik vishwaason main bhi bilkul yahi lakshan paae jate hai, phir bhi unhen sarvatra bhram nahin mana jaataa
 inhen sab kaarnon se manochikitsak anthony david ne tippanee kii ki "bhram kii koi sweekaarya yogya paribhaasha nahin he
 "psychiatrists treat a belief as a delusion when the belief of belief is utterly nonsensical, causing a distress upon the patient, or the patient remains overly anxious, especially when the patient, despite presenting contrary evidence or reasonable reasoning, Stays on his faith 'bhramon kii utpatti' ke do pramukh kaaran hai: Symptoms of 'disturbances in the functioning of the brain' are seen as the amount of dopamine increases

 Results were found to be positive - varying amounts of dopamine metabolite HVA were found in delusions of heartburn and delirium
 in parinaamon ko keval kaamchalaoo mana ja saktaa he, chunki adhyayan main or zyaada jansankhya ko lekar, bhavishya main ek baar phir anusandhan karne kii maang thi
 It would be a one-sided thing to say that a certain amount of dopamine can cause a person to suffer from some specific confusion

 Regarding the effect of personality, it has been said, "jaspers believed that the disease causes a slight change in personality and that such a change leads to the creation of a confusing environment in which confusion begins to develop
" " Cultural components are "decisively influential in the representation of illusions"

 The primitive indo-european language, also known as the proto-indo-european language, is considered by linguists to be the only ancient mother tongue of all languages of the entire indo-european language-family
 mana jaataa he ke ise pracheen kaal main aadim-hind-europea log bolaa karte the, lekin yah bhashaa hazaron varsh purv hi puri tarah se lupt ho chuki thi
 Linguists have reconstructed this missing language after comparing homogeneous words of many indo-european languages with which one can infer its words

 Qaida law to divide the legacy of inheritance or inheritance into heirs or entitlements
 daybhag hindu dharamshastra ke pradhan vishyon main se he
 There is a detailed arrangement in this regard in the memories of Manu, Yajnavalkya etc
 granthkaaron or tikaakaron ke matbhed se paitruk dhanvibhag ke sambandh main bhinn bhinn sthanon main bhinn bhinn vyavasthaayen prachlit hai
 The main parties are two - Mitakshara and Daibhag
 mitakshra yajyavlky smriti par vigyaneshwar kii tikaa he jiske anukool vyavastha punjab, kaashi, mithila aadi se lekar dakshin kanyakumari tak prachalati he
 'daibhag' is a treatise of Jemutavahana which is propagated in Vang country
 sabase pehali baat vichaar karne kii yah he ki kutumbasampatti main kisi praani kaa pruthak swatv vibhaag karne ke peeche hota he athwa pehle se rahata he
 According to Mitakshara, there is a separate or monogamous possession only when there is a department, before the department, every convergent creature has normal ownership over the entire family
 daybhag vibhaag ke pehle bhi avyakt rup main pruthak swatv maanata he jo vibhaag hone par vyanjit hota he
 Mitakshara assumes the father and son's right to the property of the ancestors, so the son can share in the ancestral property whenever the father lives and the father cannot donate, sell, etc
 any part of the ancestral property without the consent of the sons
 pita ke marane par putr jo paitruk sampatti kaa adhikari hota he vah hissedaar ke rup main haata he, uttaradhikari ke rup main nahin
 Mitakshara considers the succession of the son only in the property of the father's own property
 daybhag purvapaswami ke swatvvinaash ke uparaant uttaradhikariyon ke swatv kii utpatti maanata he
 According to him, as long as the father is alive, he has full rights over the ancestral property; He can sleep whatever he wants
 putron ke swatv kii utpatti pita ke marane aadi par hi hoti he
 Although in this verse of Yajnavalkya, Bhurya Pitamahopatta essayist Dravimeva va
 tatra syat sadrushan swamyan pituh putrasy chobhachoh pita putr kaa samaan adhikaar spasht kaha gaya he tathaapi jeemuthavahanane is shloke se khinch tanakar yah bhav nikaala he ki putron ke swatv kii utpatti unke janmkaal se nahin, valki pita ke mrityukaal se hoti he
 According to Mitakshara and Daibhaga, the order in which successors are given is given below: ityadi, ityadi
 Looking at the sequence given above, it will be known that Mitakshara is the mother's first self and the father's right
 yajyavlky kaa shloke he: Taking the word 'pitrau' of this verse, Mitakshara says that 'mata Piti' comes first in this compound and the relation of mother is more intimate, than mother's self is first
 jeemuthavahan kahata he ki 'pitaru' shabd hi pita kii pradhanta kaa bodhak he isse pehle pita kaa swatv he
 In Mithila, Kashi and Maharashtra provinces, mother's title is considered first and in Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat father's title is considered first
 mitakshra daayadhikaar main keval sambandh nimitt maanati he or daybhag pindodak kriya
 The word Mitakshara 'pind' means body and takes the same family of beings within seven generations from the spindle, but the area also takes grandson, maternal grandfather, maternal uncle, etc
 by referring to it associated with the same body
 mitakshra or daybhag ke bich mukhya mukhya baton kaa bhed neeche dikhaaya jaataa haih According to Mitakshara, the common possessions of the daughter-in-law on paternal wealth originate with their birth, but the inheritance assumes the origin of the inheritance of the heirs after the annihilation of the predecessor
 mitakshra ke anusaar vibhaag ke pehle prayek sammilit praani kaa saamaanya swatv sari sampatti par hota he, chaahe vah ansh baant na hone ke kaaran avyakt yaa anishchit ho
 According to Mitakshara, a shareholder cannot sell or mortgage Kutumb property for his personal work, but according to the scope, he can sell his indefinite share even before partition
 mitakshra ke anusaar jo dhan kai praaniyon kaa saamaanya dhan ho, uske kisi desh yaa ansh main kisi ek swami ke pruthak swatv kaa sthaapan vibhaag he
 According to the scope, the department is a consonant of separate possessions
 mitakshra ke anusaar putr pita se paitruk sampatti ko baant dene ke liye kah saktaa he, par daaybhaga ke anusaar putr ko aisa adhikaar nahin he
 According to Mitakshara, a woman can be the heir of her dead husband only when her husband is separated from her brother, her family etc
 par daybhag main, chaahe pati alag ho yaa shaamil, stri uttaradhikarini hoti he
 According to the division, if the girl is a widow, Vandhya or Aputravati, then she cannot be a successor
 mitakshra main aisa pratibandh nahin he
 According to Yajnavalkya, Narada etc
 the department of paternal wealth should be on these occasions - whenever the father wishes, the mother's menopause and the father's subjectivity, the father's dead, fallen or ascetic

 Khurd and Kalan are Persian language words found in many contexts in Hindi and in the Indian subcontinent, especially in place names
 "kurd" kaa matlab "chota" hota he or "kalaan" kaa matlab bada hota he
 These names have been used since Mughal times
 choti aabaadi vaale gaanvon-kasbon ke peeche khurd shabd lagaaya gaya
 This Persian word means small
 yah khurd sanskrit ke kshudra se hi bana he jisamen laghu, chota yaa sookshmata kaa bhav he
 There are thousands of Khurd dhari villages across the country
 isi tarah kai gaanvon ke saath kalam shabd judaa miltaa he jaise kosi kalam, baamaniyaan kalam 
 Just as the word khurd became synonymous with small or small, similarly the word kalan became synonymous with big or huge
 kalam kaa prayog lagbhag usee arth main hota tha jaise bharat ke liye prachinkaal main brihattar bharat shabd kaa prayog hota tha jisamen burma se lekar iran tak kaa samoochaa bhushetra aata tha
 However, a word like Hindustan Kalan is not found in any travelogue
 greater britain kii baat chalati thi to uske upniveshon kaa sandarbh nihit hota tha
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Kalan is also important in the context of rural populations
 kalam multah farsi kaa shabd he jiskaa matlab hota he varisht, bada, deergh yaa vishaal
 However, its etymology is unknown
 kuch sandarbhon main ise semetic bhashaa parivaar kaa bataaya jaataa he or ise ishwar kii mahanata se joda jaataa he
 This is fine on the basis of Kalan's economy, but it is not confirmed by any Semitic metal
 kalam shabd kaa prayog sirf sthanon kaa rutaba bataane ke liye hi nahin hota tha balki vyaktiyon ke naam bhi hote the jaise mirza kalam yaa amir kalam al bukhari jiskaa matlab bukhaara kaa mahaan amir hota he
 Obviously, the word Kalan means great here
 muslim shasankaal main basaahaton ke namakaran kii mahima yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 The names of many villages are associated with the word elders such as Sonpipri elders
 jaahir he hamanaam gaanv se fark karne ke liye ek basaahat ko varisht maanate hue uske aage bujurg laga diya gaya or doosraa hua sonpipari khurd 
 Many such rural settlements number in the thousands
 isi tarah kisi gaanv ke vishisht darje ko dekhte hue uske saath jaagir shabd laga diya jaataa tha
 This means that from the annual revenue collection, the part of that village will not go into the government treasury or it will get partial exemption
 mughalon ke daur main prabhavi vyaktiyon ko athwa puraskaar swaroop saamaanya varg ke logo ko bhi gaanv jaagir main diye jate the
 But to distinguish it from other villages of the same name, the newly created vassals used to add jagirs to them like Hinautia and Hinautia Jagir
 uttar bharat, pakistan or afghanistan main kai aise gaanv, shahar or mohalle hai jo ek jagah shuru hue or phir falkar unke do hisse ho gaye - ek mukhya yaa bada hissaa or ek chota hissaa
 In this case, "kalan" came to be called behind the name of the big part and "khurd" behind the small part
 iske is kshetra main hazaron udahaaran hai - Sometimes two villages and hamlets are different, but by and large they meet and become one
 aise main is kshetra main rivaaj he ke yah baat spasht kii jaae ke kurd or kalaan donon kii baat ho rahi he or unhen "kurd kalam kaha jaataa he - These two words are also used in some other contexts - helenic olympic samiti greece kii rashtriya olympic samiti he

 The ship, carrying 360 passengers, had just arrived from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport to Jinnah International Airport in Karachi and was preparing to go to John F
 Kennedy Airport in New York, USA via Frankfurt, Germany
 june 2001 main ek adaalat main aatankwaadiyon par yah abhiyog laga ki ve saipras va israel main bandi apane kuch saathiyon ko chhudaana chaahate the
 But in 2006, Michael Thexton, a passenger who survived the incident, published a book in which he claimed he had heard hijackers talking that they wanted to crash the ship into a designated target in Israel
 is hijac ke dauraan 20 yatri maare gaye jinamein 12 bhartiya the tathaa baaki america, pakistan va mexico se the
 All the kidnappers were arrested and sentenced to death

 The incident started when passengers in Karachi started boarding this plane going to Frankfurt
 baad main hui epabiai jaanch main pataa chalaa ki vimaan ke aasapaas hathiyaarband rakshakon kii maujuudagi bhi is apharan ko taal nahin pai
 The four hijackers were disguised as Karachi airport security guards and were armed with assault rifles, grenades, pistols and plastic explosive belts

 Changes were made to the van in such a way that it looks like an airport security vehicle

 The hijackers attacked the stairs itself and fired from automatic weapons, entered the aircraft and snatched away control
 flit atendent ne sthiti ko bhaanp liya or chaalak dal ko intercom par suchit kar diya jiske falswaroop payalat, sah-payalat or flite igeneer kaukapit ke apaat dwaar se safaltaapurvak nikal bhaage
 After capturing the aircraft, the hijacker Zaid Safarini soon realized that the crew had fled and was forced to negotiate with the authorities
 pratham va vayavsaayik shrenee ke yatriyon ko vimaan ke peeche kii ore jane kaa aadesh diya gaya tathaa peeche ke yatriyon ko aage aane ko kaha gaya
 Since the plane was almost full, passengers were since the plane was almost full, passengers sat down in the aisles, galleys and door exits
 At around 10 in the morning Safarini made a detour inside the aircraft and stopped in front of 29-year-old Indian American Rajesh Kumar's seat
 rajesh california kaa nivasee tha tathaa haal hi main use america naagarikta mili thi
 Safarini asked Rajesh to come forward and forced her to sit on her knees at the door of the plane with her back to the head
 adhikariyon, visheshtah viraph daroga se baatcheet karte hue usne kaha ki yadi chaalak dal ko 15 minute main vimaan main nahin bheja gaya to vah rajesh ko goli se uda degaa
 Shortly afterwards he got upset with the authorities and in front of everyone he shot Rajesh in the head and threw him on the ground outside the door
 pakistani adhikariyon kii report ke anusaar rajesh kii saans abhi chal rahi thi, kintu aspataal pahunchane se pehle raste main ambulance main hi uski mrityu ho gai
 Safarini then returned to the rest of her companions and instructed the flight attendants to collect the passports of all the passengers 
 atendents ne apni jaan ke dar se is aadesh kaa paalan kiya
 One of the flight attendants, Neerja Bhanot, feared that American passport holders could be specially targeted, so she hid some American passports under one seat and some in the trash
 passport ikatthe karne ke baad ek kru sadsy ne intercom par ek british naagarik maaikel thexton ko vimaan ke agle hisse main aane ko kaha
 He reached the next part of the plane through the curtain where he encountered Safarini who had his passport in his hand
 usne thexton se poocha ki kahin vah sipaahi to nahin or kahin uske paas bandook to nahin
 Thexton replied no
 tab usne thexton ko ghutanon ke bal baithne ko kaha or adhikariyon se bolaa ki agar koi vimaan ke nazadik aayaa to vah ek or yatri ko mar daalega
 Viraf Daroga tells him that the aircraft has a crew member who can use the cockpit's radio and can be further negotiated through it
 safarini thexton ke paas vaapis gaya or poocha ki kya use pani chahie
 Thexton said - Yes
 safarini ne yah bhi poocha ki kya vah vivaahit he or daawa kiya ki use hinsa or ye sab maar kaat bilkul pasand nahin he lekin america or israel ne unke desh par kabza kar liya he or ve dhang kii zindagi nahin ji paa rahe
 Then a hijacker asked Thexton to return

 During this time, a flight attendant quietly took out the leaf from the manual detailing all the systems of the 3R aircraft gate and concealed it in a magazine and gave it to the passenger sitting near the gate
 usne use kaha ki vah abhi magazine ko avashya pard le or baad main yadi aavashyaktaa padi to prayog kar le
 On this page, along with other information, the method of opening the exit gate and installing the slide apron was also described
 raat lagbhag 9 baje sahaayak vidyut unit band ho gayi, sabhi battiyaan bujh gayi tathaa immergency lite jal gayi
 Passengers at the front were ordered towards the back, while passengers at the back were ordered forward
 Since the aisles were already full of passengers, those passengers standing just sat down
 With the plane out of power and sitting in near darkness a hijacker at the 1L door said a prayer and then aimed to shoot at the explosive belt the other hijacker at the 1R door was wearing
 The intent was to cause an explosion massive enough to kill all passengers and crew on board, as well as themselves
 Since the cabin was so dark, the hijacker missed causing only a small detonation
 Immediately the hijackers began shooting their weapons into the cabin at passengers and attempted to throw their grenades
 Yet again the lack of light caused them to not pull pins fully and create small explosions
 Ultimately it was their bullets that created most damage since each bullet would bounce off the aircraft and create crippling shrapnel
 The flight attendant at the 3L door decided it was time to take action and opened the door and although the slide did not deploy several passengers jumped down the 15 ft to the Tarmac, including crew
 The passenger that was near 3R had read the page the flight attendant earlier gave him and was able to successfully open that door
 It was the only door opened to have the slide deploy
 Ultimately this slide allowed for more passengers to evacuate safely and without injuries
 Neerja Bhanot assisted a number of passengers to escape from the flight, then she laid down her life shielding three children from the bullets fired by the terrorists
 Twenty passengers were killed and over a hundred were injured, but many escaped the ordeal including Michael Thexton, who came close to death a few hours before and returned to the U

 When light or sound waves collide with an obstacle, they fold over the edges of the barrier and enter the geometric shadow of the resistor
 tarango ke is prakaar mudane kii ghatana ko vivartan kehete hai
 It has been found that after hitting small size barriers, the waves turn and when the wave passes through small sized holes, it propagates
 sabhi prakaar kii tarangon se vivartan hota he 
 If an opaque object is placed between a photogenic source and the curtain, the shadow of the object is created on the screen
 bahudhaa chaaya kaa kinaaraa tikshn hota he or uske chaaron ore parde kaa bhaag samaan rup se prakashit rahata he
 If the light source is small in point, the edge of the shadow is not found sharp when looked at carefully
 kinare par prakaash or andhkaar kii dhaariyaan dikhaai padati hai
 It seems that the rays of light have twisted and reached within the range of geometric shadows
 is ghatana ko prakaash kaa vivartan kehete hai
 The stripes formed along the edge of the shadow are called diffraction patterns
 vivartan kii jaankaree se purv yahi mana jaataa tha ki kisi ek madhyam main prakaash sidhi rekhaon main chalata he
 But diffraction cannot be explained on the basis of simple linear movement of light
 sarvapratham newton, greemaldi or tii
 yang ne is ghatana par dhyaan diya tha
 Newton and Grimaldi were the promoters and followers of the corpuscles of light, so they tried unsuccessfully to understand the phenomenon of diffraction on this basis

 je
 frenel tathaa frounhophar ne isi siddhant ke aadhaar par vivartan tathaa vivartan se sambandhit anya ghatnaon ko safalataa purvak samajhaayaa
 When a round hole, rectangular lineage, sharp core or fine wire of an object is placed in the path of light, different diffraction patterns are formed in each case
 vivartan kii sabhi ghatnaon ko do vibhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he : Fraunhofer diffraction and Frennel diffraction
 jab prakashasrot or pardaa vivartak vastu se atyant dur hote hai, arthath vivartak par samtal tarangagra apaatit hota he, tab vivartan pattern ko frounhophar pattern or ghatana ko frounhophar vivartan kaha jaataa he
 When the source, curtain, or both, are at a fixed distance from the reflecting object, ie, the spherical or cylindrical wavelength is incident on the deflector, the phenomenon of diffraction is called frennel diffraction
 frenel vivartan dekhnaa apekshaakrit saral hota he, kintu ise samajhnaa kathin hota he
 To see the Fraunhofer diffraction, a special type of arrangement has to be done, which gives a flat wavelength
 vivartan ke baad use pun: focus karne kii vyavastha kerani padati he, kintu iskaa siddhant samajhnaa bahut saral he
 Fronhofer diffraction: - Diffraction in which the light source and the curtain are at an infinite distance from the resistor
 sodium lap se pile rang kaa ekvarni prakaash praapt hota he
 With the help of a lens, this light is applied to a very narrow line of scintillation in a black curtain, then this line itself acts as a light source
 ab is rekhachhidr ke aage lens lagaakar samaantar kiranpunj ko ek duusare rekhachhidr par daalaa jaae tathaa is rekhachhidr ke peeche safed pardaa rakhaa jaae, to parden par duusare rekhachhidr kaa vivartan pattern ban jaataa he
 There is a very intense band or band in the middle of this pattern
 is pattee ke donon ore apekshaakrit bahut kam tivrata kii or bhi pattiyaan pai jaati hai
 The middle belt is called the main height and other strips are the secondary height
 do sameepvarti rekhachhidron kaa vivartan pattern ek rekhachhidr ke vivartan pattern se kuch bhinn hota he
 In the pattern of a lineage, where the diaphragm is found, in the pattern of the two lines, many stripes are formed at the same places, which are thinner and sharper than the earlier bands
 jyon-jyon rekhachhidron kii sankhya badhati jaati he, dwitiyak ucchishth kii dhaariyaan ksheen hoti jaati hai or mukhya ucchishth kii dhaariyaan atyant tikshn hoti jaati hai
 The width of the line and their mutual distance also greatly affect the sharpness of these stripes
 shishe kii samtal pattee par heere kii kani se rekhaayen khinch di jaaen, to prayek do rekha ke bich kaa paardarshak sthaan rekhachhidr kaa kaam karata he
 a group of similar lineages is called Grenting
 grating kaa avishkaar frounhophar ne kiya tha
 He made a grating by wrapping fine wire over two screws
 prayek do taron ke bich kaa sthaan rekhachhidr kaa kaam karata he
 He later drew grating by drawing lines on a glass plate

 Nowadays, up to 30,000 or 40,000 lines are drawn on one inch by good machines
 yadi kisi prakashasrot ke sammukh lens rakhkar, ekvarni samaantar kirnon ko ek grating par daalaa jaae, to isse praapt vivartan main ek duusari se dur dur kai tikshn rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 These lines are actually the diffraction images of the porous source
 bich kii sabase teevr rekha ko shunya koti kii rekha kehete hai
 The first, second, third lines on both sides of it are called first, second and third lines respectively
 yadi grating par shwet prakaash daalaa jaae, to shunya koti kii rekha shwet hoti he, kintu anya koti kii rekhaon sthaan par spectrum praapt hote hai
 These are called spectrum of first, second, third etc
 respectively
 yadi grating se vivartit honevaale prakaash kaa tarangadairghy l, aaptit tarangagra kaa aapatan kone i or vivartan kone q ho tathaa kinhin do samipsth rekhachhidron ke madhyabinduon kii parsparik duuri d ho, to d = nl
 n spectrum kii koti kaa dyotak he
 The grating described above is called plane diffraction grating
 yadi vakr shishe par aluminium kii kalai kar di jaae or usee par heere kii kani se rekhaayen khurch di jaaen, to prayek do rekhaon ke bich kaa bhaag ek nanhen paravarti darpan kaa kaam karata he
 Diffraction patterns are also formed by the interference of the reflected waves from these parts
 is grating ko avatal grating kehete hai
 It was invented by Roland
 avatal grating avatal darpan kaa bhi kaam karata he
 Therefore, lenses do not have to be used to focus the diffracted rays
 spectrumiki main spectrum praapt karne ke liye vakr grating se bade upyogi spectrograph banaae gaye hai
 Even for curve grating, the formula for wavelength is d = nl
 do vibhinn varnon kii rashmiyon ko ek duusare se pruthak karne kii kshamta ko grating kii varnavikshepan kshamta kaha jaataa he
 If l1- l2 = Dl and their diffraction angles are q1 and q2 and q1 - q2 = Dq respectively, the grating has a character deflection capacity
 tarangadairghy ke sutara se iskaa maan hota he
 Character deflection capacity increases in higher order respectively
 yadi l or l+dl do atyant sameepvarti vikiran hon or grating dwaara inako ek duusare se alag-alag dekha ja sake to dl ko grating kii vibhedan kshamta kehete hai
 n is the number of total lines drawn on the grating
 kramash: ucchtar koti main vibhedan kshamta bhi badhati jaati he
 Frennel diffraction: - a diffraction in which the light source and the curtain are at a limited distance from the resistor or a baffle
 chaaya ke kinare par vivartan pattern kaa bananaa prakaash ke saral raikhik gaman se nahin samajhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Frennel used wave theory to explain this
 kisi tarangagra ke vibhinn binduon kaa prabhaav samajhane ke liye unhone ardh kaal jone kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya
 The zone plate based on this principle works like a lens and confirms Frennel's theory
 yadi kisi atyant chote chhidr par ekvarni samtal tarangagra aaptit hota ho, to parden par iskaa vivartan pattern ban jaataa he
 Circular stripes are found in this pattern
 sabase bahari dhari sabase adhik moti hoti he or bhitari dhaariyaan kramash: patali hoti hai
 This diffraction can be interpreted on the basis of Frennel's half-zone
 yadi chhidr kaa aakaar pratham ardhakaal zone ke baraabar ho or pattern ke centre tathaa chhidr kii paridhi kii duriyon kaa antar l / 2 ho, to pattern kaa centre prakashit hota he
 If the size of the hole is increased by keeping the hole distance constant from the curtain, then this center is illuminated and unpublished respectively

 Let me tell you one truth; i have never passed a college; And for the first time today i have come so close to the graduation ceremony of a college
 aaj main aapako apane jivan kii teen kahaniyaan sunaanaa chaahoonga 


 zyada kuch nahin bas teen kahaniyaan
 My first story is about connecting the dots
 read college main daakhila lene ke 6 maheene ke andar hi maine padhai chhod di, par main uske 18 maheene baad tak vahaan kisi tarah aata-jaataa rahaa
 So the question arises why did i leave college? Actually, it started before i was born
 meri jaivik maan * ek yuva, avivaahit snaatakachatra thi, or vah mujhe kisi or ko god lene ke liye dena chaahati thi
 But he had a desire that only a college graduate should adopt me
 sabakuch bilkul tha or main ek vakil or uski patni dwaara apanaaya jane vaala tha ki achaanak us danpati ne apana vichaar badal diya or tay kiya ki unhen ek ladki chahie
 So at midnight, my visiting parents were called and asked, "we have a boy, would you like to adopt him?" And he quickly said yes
 baad main meri maa ko pataa chalaa ki meri maan college se paas nahin hai or pita to hai skool paas bhi nahin hai
 He therefore refused to sign the adoption papers; But after a few months, after my parents assured me to send me to college, she agreed
 to meri jindagi ki shuruyaat kuch is tarah hui or satraa saal baad main college gaya
 


 But i accidentally chose a college as expensive as Stanford
 mere naukari pesha mata-pita kii sari jamaa-poonji meri padhai main jane lagi
 After 6 months i did not see any value in this study
 mujhe kuch samaj naheemparaha tha ki main apni jindagi main kya karnaa chahta hoon, or college mujhe kis tarah se isamen madad karegaa
 
 And above all i was spending my parents' lifetime earnings
 isliye maine college drop out karne kaa nirnay liye
 

and thought whatever would be good
 us samay to yah sab-kuch mere liye kaaphi daraavna tha par jab main peeche mud kar dekhtaa hoon to mujhe lagata he ye meri jindagi kaa sabase acha nirnay tha
 As soon as i left college, my obligation to do the required classes was over
 or main chup-chaap sirf apane hit kii kakshaen karne laga
 It was not so easy
 mere paas rahane ke liye koi kamare main nahin tha, isliye mujhe doston ke kamare main farsh pe sona padataa tha
 i used to eat from the money i got from returning the Coke bottle
 

 
main har ravivaar 7 mile paidal chal kar hare krishna mandir jaataa tha, taaki kam se kam hafte main ek din pet bhar kar khaanaa kha sakuun
 i used to like it a lot
 maine apni jindagi main jo bhi apni jigyaasa or antargyaan kii vajah se kiya vah baad main mere liye amuly sabit hua
 Here i would like to give an example
 us samay read college shaayad duniya kii sabase acchhee jagah thi jahaan kushkhat * sikhaaya jaataa tha
 Every poster, every label in the whole complex was beautifully written with hands
 chunki main college se drop out kar chukaa tha isliye mujhe saamaanya kakshaon karne kii koi zarurat nahin thi
 i decided that i would do calligraphy classes and learn it well
 maine cerriff or bina cerife prakaar-chehre ke bare main siikhaa; alag-alag akshar -sangyojan ke bich menthaan bananaa or sthaan ko ghataane -badhaane se tip kii gayi akritiyon ko khubasurat kaise banaaya ja saktaa he yah bhi siikhaa
 It was beautiful, so artistic that it could not be captured by science, and i loved it
 us samay zaraa si bhi ummid nahin thi ki main in chizon kaa upyog karen kabhi apni jindagi main karunga
 But ten years later, when we were building the first Macintosh computer, i designed it on a Mac
 or mike khubasurat typography yukt duniya kaa pehla computer ban gaya
 If i hadn't dropped out of college, i would never have had a Mac multi-typeface proportionally spaced fonts, so probably these things wouldn't have happened in any personal computer
 agar maine kabhi drop out hi nahin kiya hota to main kabhi sulekh kii wo kakshaen nahin kar paata or phir shaayad personal computer main jo phont hote hai, wo hote hi nahin
 Of course, when i was in college it was impossible to see these points in the future; But after ten years when i look back and see, everything is clearly visible
 aap kabhi bhi bhavishya main jhaank kar in binduon kojod nahin sakate hai
 You can add these points only by looking at the past; So you have to believe that what is happening right now will somehow get connected to your future
 aapako kisi na kisi cheez main vishwavaas karnaa hi hoga -apane himmat main, apni niyati main, apni jindagi yaa phir apane karm main 


 kisi na kisi cheez main vishwaas karnaa hi hoga
 

 because keep believing in this thing that later on you will be able to connect the dots which will give you the courage to listen to the voice of your heart
 

 tab bhi jab aap bilkul alag raste par chal rahe honge
 

 and that will make a difference

 The Tuvalu Monarchy is the constitutional monarchy of Tuvalu
 tuvaalu ke ekadhidaruk ko tuvaalu or united kingdom samet kul 15 prajabhumiyon, kaa sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler has been Queen Elizabeth II since 6 February 1952
 anya rashtramandal deshon ke saamaan hi tuvaalu kii raajnneetik vyavastha westminster pranali par aadhaarit he, jisamen rashtrapramukh kaa pad nammaatr hota he, or vaastavik prashasnic shaktiyaan shashanpramukh par nihit hote hai
 Tuvalu is theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of Tuvalu is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all of the constitutional powers of the governor-general of Tuvalu as his representative
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " tuvaalu kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " tuvaalu ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical backdrop of the monarchy in Tuvalu dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world
 dhire-dhire in upniveshon ko apni prashasan par samprabhutaa pradaan kar di gai, or westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara in saare rajyon ko rashtramandal ke andar, purnatah samaan pad de diya gaya tha
 Those countries which considered the former colony, the British ruler, as their ruler even today, are called Commonwealth of Nations or Commonwealth Territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhitvatmak kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 The rules related to succession can be changed only by the Parliamentary Act, which is mandatory to be passed with the approval of all subjects
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 No successor of Singhasana can voluntarily renounce his succession
 tuvaalu kii sarkaar samprabhu, rajpariwaar yaa desh ke baahar sthit shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav ke samarthan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii aarthik sahaayta nahin pradaan karti he
 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general
 jabaki rajnatik-shaktiyon kaa abhyay governor-general dwaara sarkaar or apane mantriyon kii salaah or vinirdeshon par hi karte hai
