 In the actual engine, there is some impediment to the mixing of the fuel-air-mixing reducing device called resistor, and the intake and exhaust valves
 isliye mishran ko chuusate samay silinder main daab vayumandaleey daab se kam hi rah jaati he
 As a result, the mixture does not penetrate as much as is considered in theoretical calculations
 saidhantik gananaa main to maan liya jaataa he ki silinder ke bheetar mishran kii daab vayumandaleey daab ke baraabar he
 Then, the inner surface of the cylinder, and the mixtures remain relatively hot
 isliye silinder main pahunchne par idhan mishran garam ho jaataa he
 According to the volume heat-pressure law, the mass of the mixture in the cylinder is less than the mass that would have been when it was cold due to the increase in temperature
 phir, vaastavik ingine main silinder ke chhot sthaan main, nikaas ghaat ke purna ho jane par bhi, gaisen aadi vayumandaleey daab se adhik daab par rah jaati hai or chushan ghaat ke aarambh main ve silinder main fail jaati hai
 Suction begins only after their pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure
 isse bhi siddhanthata pariklit maatra se kam hi mishran silinder main pravesh karata he
 Finally, the higher the engine is above sea level, the lower the atmospheric pressure
 isliye dravyaman ke anusaar jitna mishran silinder main samudratal par pravisht ho sakegaa usase kam hi mishran unche sthalon main pravisht ho paaegaa
 The rectangular efficiency of the combustion engine not only decreases with increasing height, it also decreases with increasing engine speed
 isliye daud pratiyogita main prayukt injanon or adhik oonchaai par kaam karanevaale injanon main bahudhaa supercharger laga diya jaataa he
 There is a small centrifugal fan in this device which pushes the fuel-air mixture at a higher pressure of atmospheric pressure in the cylinder
 supercharger lagane se aaytneey dakshata bad jaati he, yahan tak ki yah 1 se adhik bhi ho ja sakati he
 In the analysis of the Otto cycle it has been shown that increasing the compression ratio increases efficiency
 vaastavik injanon main bhi yahi pravriti dikhaai padati he
 In engines operating according to the Otto cycle, the fuel enters the suction shock as well as the fuel and hence it is present in the compression shock as well
 jab sampeden anupaat bahut bada rakhaa jaataa he to sampeden ke ek niyat maatra se adhik hote hi idhan mishran main adhisphot hota he, arthath idhan swayan, bina spark plag se chinagaari aae, jal uthta he
 Then, even if this does not happen, compression waves arise when the spark plugs start to burn, sparking ahead of the burning mixture near the spark
 in sampeden laharon ke kaaran chinagaari se dur kaa mishran swayan jal uth saktaa he, jo avaanchhneeya he
 Then, the fuel mixture may burn prematurely by burning the charred residue of petrol etc
 somewhere in the cylinder, or by burning the charred residue of petrol, etc
 inside the piston, or by the hot tip of any component inside the piston
 
 jab kabhi sampidit mishran samay se pehle jal uthta he to uskaa yah jalanaa adhisphotak hota he
 It is heard by ear - it seems that a metal is being hit with a hammer
 shighratapurvak jalane vaale idhano main adhisphot kii ashanka adhik rahati he
 There have been many new discoveries in the last few decades, which can keep the compression ratio much larger without being overcorrected
 udhaahrant: Motorcar engines had a compression ratio of about 4
5 in about 1920–25; Sometimes it was 3

 vartmaan samay main yah anupaat 6

 The acceleration of engines is usually stated in revolutions per minute, but it is not determined how many revolutions per minute the engine is placed in which of these special classes
 iske atirikt teevrgati vaashp ingine main jitne chakkar prati minute hote hai, ve atyant mandgati antardahan ingine ke chakkar prati minute 4,000 yaa kuch adhik chakkar kaa veg rahata he, parantu daud kii pratiyogita ke liye bane injanon main chakkar prati minute 6,000 ke aasapaas hote hai
 Diesel engines, which have about 1,000 revolutions per minute, are called rapid diesel

 The velocity of the piston also determines the range of motion of the engines, because greatly increasing the velocity of the piston destroys the engine quickly
 motorcar ke injanon main piston-veg ab 2,800 foot prati minute yaa isse bhi kuch adhik rakhaa jaataa he
 The average velocity of a piston in diesel engines is between 1,000 and 1,200 feet per minute
 injanon kii naap silinder ke vyas or piston kii daud se bataai jaati he
 For example, a 12-18 inch engine means that the cylinder has a diameter of 12 inches and the piston races 18 inches

 Dhammapada is the best popular text of Buddhist literature
 isamen buddha bhagavan ke naitik upadeshon kaa sangrah yamak, appamaad, chitt aadi 26 vaggon main vargeekrut 423 pali gaathaon main kiya gaya he
 Its location in Tripitaka is second among the 15 subdivisions of Khudkatapathadi of Khudkadikanaya, the fifth division of Sutpitaka
 granth kii aadhi se adhik gaathaayen tripitak ke naanaa sutton main prasangbaddh pai ja chuki hai
 From the available evidence of the creation of Dhammapada BC It is believed that it was between 300 and 100
 buddha sangh main is granth kaa itnaa gaharaa prabhaav he ki usamen paarangat hue bina lanka main kisi bhikshu ko upasanpada pradaan nahin kii jaati
 'dhammapada' etymologically means a word, line or phraseological phrase
 granth main swayan kaha gaya he- anarth padon se yukt sahasron gaathaon ke bhashaan se aisa ekmaatr arthpad, gathapad va dhammapad adhik shreykar he jise sunakar upashanti ho jaae 
 Buddhist monks often begin their discourse by taking the basis of a saga or a fraction of it in the same text, just as a Christian clergyman from a biblical text
 is kaary main unhen dhammapad kii atthkatha naamak tikaa se badi sahaayta milti he jisamen prayek gaatha ke vishad arth ke atirikt uske drushtaant swaroop ek va anek kathaayen di gai hai
 This Attakatha has been collected from the Tripitaka by Buddhaghosa or any other teacher of his time
 isamen vaasavadatta or udayan kii katha bhi ai he
 The treatise which is so ancient, which has a great reputation in the Buddhist sect, and has been praised by other scholars with a free speech, is inherently curiosity in addition to the general practical policy in it

 Here Lord Buddha himself says, "I ran continuously in the world for many births and looked for the creator of that home-like body, because this repeated birth is painful
 re grihakaarak, ab maine tuje dekh liya, ab tu pun: ghar na bana paavega
 i have fractured all your episodes, the house has disintegrated, the mind is shattered, and my craving has waned
 "here the belief of a creature and its rebirth and the liberation from rebirth through the destruction of samskara and trishna is clear
 moksh kaa swaroop evam use praapt karne kii kriya kaa yahan is prakaar varnan he- "jinke paapon kaa sanchay nahin rahaa yaa jinka bhojanamaatr parigrahashesh rahaa he, tathaa asrav ksheen ho gaye hai, unako vah shunyatmak va animittak moksh gochaar he 
 Here the salvation from the causes of Papabandha, decay of Asravana and accumulated deeds is constituted of the zero and infinite form of salvation
 "koi papakarmi garbh se manushya yaa pashuyoni main utpann hote hai, koi narak ho or koi sumati dwaara swarg ko jate hai, tathaa jinke asrav nahin rahaa ve parinirvana ko praapt hote hai
 Space, sea, mountain, etc
, there is no such region in the world where the sinner can get rid of the results, "false sinners and incontrovertible monks Pramadi, Pardharsevi, Falsehood etc
 are all hell-bent"
 yahan jeev kii garbh yoni, narak, swarg va mukti in gatiyon tathaa karmfal kii anivaaryta kii sweekruti main andeh nahin rahata
 The form of Brahmin has been described in a whole wagga, which are important from many points of view, historical, religious and social

 i would say that Brahmin is a renunciate of Kamatrishna, non-active, non-violent, sinless by mind and speech, devoid of ragadesh mana, forgiving, knowledgeable, meditator, attenuated Arahant

 Together with these two, Senart Sahib published his edit in 1897
 yahi granth adhik vyavasthit rup main varua or mitra dwaara sampadit hokar san 1921 main kalakatta vishvavidhyalay se prakashit hua
 According to these editors, the language of this Dhammapada is from Gandhara region and it matches the language of Ashoka's Shahbazgarhi and Mansarahra commendations in its sounds and linguistic form
 isliye is granth kaa naam "praakrit dhammapad" rakhaa gaya he
 It has 12 wagga and 251 gathas
 senart dwaara sampadit sanskrit mahavastu ke tritiy pariched main dhammapad-sahassavgrg ke 24 padya uddhrut kiye gaye hai
 While Pali Tripitak's Sahaswagag has only 16 gathas
 isse prathit hota he ki mahavastu ke karta ke sanmukh ek sanskrit padyatmak dharmapad tha jisamen padyon kii sakhya pali dhammapad kii apeksha adhik thi
 There are four translations of Dhammapada in the Chinese language, one of which has 500 translations in the second, 700 in the third, 900 in the third and about 1000 gathas in the fourth and their stories are found
 inamen se pratham teen kaa rachanakaal isa kii teesri shatee va chaturth kaa chauthi va naunvi shatiyon ke bich pramanit hota he
 The original texts of these four must have been very independent in number and order of their classes and gathas

 raaj khanna, puja saahani or tina kapur bachapan ke dost hai
 While Raj has always been attracted to the lively and beautiful Tina, she is completely unaware of Pooja's love for her
 raaj ke pita ne apane parivaar ke saath ek nai naukari ke liye england jane kaa faisla kiya
 Before leaving, Raj promises Tina to text her via e-mail
 tina lokapriy ladki he or jald hi anya chizon main vyast ho jaati he
 So Pooja writes Raj in the name of Tina so that Tina can fulfill her promise
 raaj or puja main kai chijen samaan hai or unke i-mail unhen ek-duusare ke kareeb laate hai
 a decade later, Raj returns to India for a short vacation
 ab tak vah jis ladki ko likh rahaa tha usase pyaar karata he or maanata he ki vah use pehali najar main pahchaan saktaa he
 When the three finally meet, he ignores Pooja completely and falls in love with Tina
 tina prarambh main anishchit hoti he lekin vah bhi dhire-dhire usase aakarshith ho jaati he
 However during the two weeks of his vacation he notices that the actual Tina is completely different from the Tina in the e-mail
 vah puja ke saath dosti bhi shuru karata he or apane saamaanya dilchaspee se prabhavit hota he
 But without realizing that he is indeed what he loves
 vah landan laut aata he jahaan puja sanyog se saakshaatkaar ke liye aati he
 Raj attends a church where he often attends

 unki aakhri ichha yah thi ki tina raaj se shaadi karegi, jise unhone raaj ke pita ko vyakt kiya tha
 Knowing that Tina also loves Raj and that she is now single, Pooja refuses to marry Raj
 kyonki vah tina ke dil ko todna nahin chaahati
 Raj's parents also agree to the marriage
 vah log landan main viksit raaj or puja ke bich sambandhon se anjaan hai
 Raj insists on telling his parents the truth but Pooja stops him

 == bhugolic sthiti == antakartica mahadweep Bio-degradable plastics are plastics that decompose in the environment as natural aerobic and non-biodegradable
 plastic kaa jaev-nimnikaran, paryaavaran main sookshmjivon ko sakriy kar sampann kiya ja saktaa he, jo plastic jhilliyon kii anvik sanrachana ke upaapachay dwaara ek khaad sadrush mitti vaale akriy padaarth kaa nirmaan karte hai or paryaavaran ke liye kam hanikaarak hote hai
 They are made of bio-plastics or plastics whose components are made from renewable raw materials, or petroleum-based plastics with a mixture of additional substances
 failaav vaale karkon ke mishranyukt jaev-sakriy yogic ke prayog se yah sunishchit hota he ki jab ve taap tathaa nami ke sampark main aate hai to plastic anuon kii sanrachana ko prasaarit kar dete hai or jaev-sakriy yogicon ko plastic ke upaapachay tathaa udaasinikaran ke liye prerit kar dete hai
 Bio-degrading plastics are manufactured exclusively in two forms: injection molded, which are used in food service items to be thrown away after use, and membranes, which are especially organic fruit packaging and collections for leaves and grass clippings
 Doing bags and non-weeds are used in agricultural weeds

96 committee of 'environmentally Degradable Plastics and Biobased Products'
 maujuuda eestm maanakon ko maanak vinirdeshon tathaa maanak jaanch vidhiyon ke rup main paribhaashit kiye jate hai
 Standard specifications create successful and unsuccessful scenarios, while standard screening methods identify specific probe scales that promote a specific biodegradable plasticity
 vartmaan main aise teen eestm maanak vinirdesh hai, jo mukhya rup se khaad-nirmaan vaale paryaavarnon main jaev-nimnikarak plasticon se nipatate hai, jinamein eestm D6400-04 khaad banane yogya plasticon ke liye maanak vinirdesh, eestm D6868 - 03 kaagaj ke starikaran tathaa anya adhistareey padaarthon ke rup main prayukt plasticon ke liye maanak vinirdesh, tathaa eestm D7081 - 05 samudri paryaavaran main aplavi jaev-nimnikarak plasticon ke liye maanak vinirdesh hote hai
 Currently the most accurate standard screening method for non-biodegradable environment is ASTM D5511 - 02, which is the standard screening method for non-biodegradable determination of plastic materials under high-solids pre-digestive conditions

 However, biodegradable plastics are not drugs for every brain
 Some critics believe that a potential environmental disadvantage of certified biodegradable plastics is that the carbon trapped in them is released into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases
 haalanki prakritik-padaarthon se praapt jaev-nimnikarak plastic, jaise subjiyon vaali fasalon se yaa jantu utpaada se vyutpann plastic apni vruddhi ke charan main CO2 ko alag karte hai, is prakaar jab ve apaghatit ho rahe hote hai keval tabhi CO2 mukt karte hai, isliye carbon dioxide utsarjan main koi parinami vruddhi nahin hoti
 However, bio-degradation of certified biodegradable plastics requires a special environment with moisture and oxygen, which is found in commercially operated manure manufacturing sites
 prakritik padaarthon se praapt jaev-nimnikarak plasticon ke prasanskaran main prayukt carbon, jeevashm indhan tathaa jal ke kul prayog tathaa unke maanav khaadya aapurti ke liye nakaaratmak prabhaav ko lekar kaaphi bahes chal rahi he
 Traditional plastics made from non-renewable fossil fuels contain more carbon trapped than the amount of carbon used in plastic processing
 carbon, plastic ke latis ke bheetar fanse hote hai tathaa ve virale hi punarchakrit kiye jate hai
 The concern is that when other biodegradable materials, including real biodegradable plastics, decompose in a non-biodegradable environment, other greenhouse gases, methane, may be free
 in vishesh kachra-sthalon vaale vaataavaran se nirmit methane vishesh rup se ekatra kiya jaataa he or vaataavaran main mukt hone se bachaane ke liye unhen jala diya jaataa he
 Some garbage sites now collect methane biogas for the use of clean cheap energy
 nishchit rup se ajaev-nimnikarak plastic ko jalaane se caburn daai oxide bhi mukt hota he
 Plastics remain in existence for hundreds of years due to the deposition of plastics made from natural biodegraders of non-biodegradable environments
 yues ipie ne kachra sthal digaayan tathaa nirmaan ke liye kade maanak lagu kiye hai taaki pramukh rup se kachra sthalon main jaev-nimnikaran ko roka ja sake
 isliye kachra sthal se mithain kaa uddeshypurna utpaadan ek viral udhaaharan he or adhiktar shahari thos apshisht ke liye niyam nahin he
 It is also possible that eventually bacteria will develop the ability to degrade plastics
 This has already happened with nylon: In 1975, two types of nylon-resistant bacteria, flavobacteria and Pseudomonas, were discovered that found an enzyme capable of decomposing nylon
 jabaki niptaan ke liye koi samaadhaan nahin he, to aise main yah sambhav he ki jeevanuon main anya sanshleshit plasticon ke upyog kii bhi kshamta viksit kar le
 varsh 2008 main 16 varsh ke ek ladke ne kathith rup se plastic khaane vaale do jeevanuon kaa pataa lagaaya
 The latter possibility was in fact the subject of a cautionary novel written by Cyberman's producers Kit Pedlar and Gerry Davis, where he reused the plot of the first serial of his Doomwatch series
 varsh 1971 main likhit upanyaas mutant 59: da plastic iter, ek aisi kahani he, jisamen plastic ke bhakshan ke liye utpann hone vaale yaa kritrim rup se nirmit kiye jeevanu ko ek bade shahar main chhod diya jaataa he
 Bio-polymer materials such as polyhydroxyalkanoate can be completely composted in an industrial manure manufacturing site

 Complete biodegradable plastics are quite expensive, in part because they are not widely manufactured to achieve large economic scale
 kuch yojya padaarth jab ek paaramparik plastic main milaae jate hai, tab sookshmjeev unke hydrocarbonon ko soonghtey hai or unki anvik sanrachana kii ore aakarshith ho jate hai
 When oil is in the ground, microorganisms are attracted to hydrocarbons and feed oil to form natural gas, which contains 50% methane gas
 tel ko jab vikhandit kiya jaataa he, tab 4% kaa istemaal plastic udyog ke liye kiya jaataa he, par yadi plastic udyog is 4% kaa prayog nahin karata he tab is 4% ko bekaar mana jaataa he or use baahar kar diya jaataa he yaa hataa diya jaataa he or apshisht niptaan sthal par use jamaa kar diya jaataa he; anya 4% kaa prayog aapke upabhokta utpaadon ke nirmaan main kiya jaataa he
 It is during this stage of fission of organic compounds that attract microorganisms towards the molecular structure of plastic they are burnt
 jalaae jane vaale jaivik yogic tathaa anya pramukh yogic jo sookshmjivon kii nirdisht sankhya kii bodh ko badhaate hai or sookshmjivon ke piech santulan ko plastic kii aanvik sanrachana main sthit kiya jaataa he, taaki aise plastic utpaada banaae ja saken jo saamaanya plastic kii apeksha 100 guna adhik tivrata se nimnikrut ho sake
 Under appropriate conditions, biodegradable plastics can be degraded to the point where microorganisms can metabolize them
 tel aadhaarit jaev-nimnikarak plastic sangrahit carbon ko carbon dioxide ke rup main mukt kar sakate hai
 Mud-based bio-plastics made by sustainable agricultural methods can be almost carbon neutral, but can have a detrimental effect on soil, water use and quality, and can lead to high food prices
 ‘socity of plastic ejiniers’ ke anusaar har varsh duniyabar main lagbhag 200 million ton plastic kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 Of those 200 million tons, 26 million tons are produced in the US
 varsh 2003 main ipie ne soochna di ki un 26 million ton plastic kacharon kaa keval 5
8% hi punarchakrit kiya jaataa he, haalanki yah teji se bad rahaa he
 The major reason that frustrates plastic recycling targets is that traditional plastics are often mixed with organic wastes, making it difficult and impractical to recycling the polymers within it without expensive sanitation and cleaning methods
 duusari ore, in mishrit jaivik padaarthon se khaad kaa nirmaan karnaa apshishton kii ek badi maatra kaa nipataara karne or saamudayik punarchakran lakshyon main naatakeey rup se vruddhi karne kii ek sambhavit ranneeti hoti he
 Food waste, and wet, non-recycling paper include 50 million tons of solid urban waste
 In these waste classes, bio-degradable plastics can displace unmanageable plastics, causing urban waste to be composted, large quantities of unused waste from waste sites Becomes a major reason for applying to other work
 bhale hi paaramparik plasticon kii thodi maatra hi jaivik padaarthon main milaai jaae par plastic ke nanhe tukdon ke kaaran jaivik apshishton kaa puraa samooh hi “sandooshit” ho jaataa he, jo acchhee gunvattta vaale khaad padaarth ko barabaad kar detaa he
 Therefore, fertilizer manufacturers will not accept mixed organic waste classes until they are completely devoid of non-degradable plastics
 Therefore, even a relatively small amount of unmodifiable plastics disrupts an important waste disposal strategy
 haalanki jaev-nimnikarak plasticon ke samarthak yah daleel pesh karte hai ki ye padaarth is samasya kaa samaadhaan prastut karte hai
 Authenticated biodegradable plastics compost plants have their full bio-degradable capacity as well as their usefulness
 apekshaakrit kam maatra main mishrit plasticon ko punarchakrit karne ke bare main chintit hone kii bajaae ye samarthak yah maanate hai ki pramanit jaev-nimnikarak plasticon ko anya jaivik apshishton ke saath sheeghra mishrit kiya ja saktaa he, jisase aprapya thos apshisht kii badi maatra main khaad-nirmaan sambhav ho paata he
 Commercial composting of all mixed organic materials then becomes commercially viable and economically sustainable
 adhik sankhya main nagar-nikaay adhik boj vaale kachra sthalon se ullekhneey maatra main apshishton kaa disha-parivartan kar sakate hai, kyonki sampurna apshisht varg ab jaev-nimnikarak ho jate hai or isliye unka prasanskaran aasaan ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the use of biodegradable plastics is seen as a motivator for the full realization of large quantities of urban concrete waste, which would be inaccessible by means other than waste sites or burning ash

 For the productivity of its existing plastics manufacturing with BP in the US, it would require 1
62 square meters per kilogram of the volume produced
 While this location requirement may be appropriate, it would be important to see how much this mass production would have affected the food prices and the cost of land use compared to the alternative method in this method

 The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the secretion of the digestive juices lipase from the pancreas, which normally goes into the liver for further processing, or to adipose tissue for storage
 stanadhariyon main paanch hormone hote hai jo pachak pranali main sahaayak hote hai or use niyantrit karte hai
 There are many changes in vertebrates, for example in birds
 These processes are complex, and additional details have been continuously discovered

 The museum of Lakshmivilas Palace in Vadodara has a large collection of his paintings
 raja ravi verma kaa janm 29 april 1848 ko kerala ke ek chote se shahar kilimanoor main hua
 At the young age of five, he started painting the walls of his house from the events of daily life
 unke chachaa kalakaar raaj raja verma ne unki pratibha ko pahachaanaa or kala kii praarambhik shiksha di
 At the age of fourteen, he took him to Thiruvananthapuram where he was taught oil painting in the palace
 baad main chitrakala ke vibhinn ayaamon main dakshata ke liye unhone mysore, baroda or desh ke anya bhaagon kii yatra kii
 The credit for Raja Ravi Varma's success goes to his well-organized art education

 Ashtasiddhi lakshmi Saraswati bhishma pratigya Yashoda decorating Krishna radhamadhav Arjun and Subhadra gangavataran Shakuntala duhkhi shakuntla Draupadi draupadi kaa satvaharan Straggler yatra udyog main, yatri kaa naam record athwa paisanger nem record ) ek computer reserveshan system ) ke databes main ek aisa record he, jisamen ek yatri yaa saath yatra karne vaale yatriyon ke samooh ke liye pathpradarshak pustak shaamil hoti he
 The PNR principle was first introduced by airlines who needed to exchange reservation information in situations when passengers needed multiple airlines to reach their destination
 To this end, IATA defined a standard for PNR content and layout
 jab ek yatri ek pathpradarshak pustak book karata he, tab yatrakarta yaa yatra website upyogkarta us computer reserveshan system main ek pienaar banaata he jise vah istemaal karata he
 This is typically a large global delivery system, such as Amadeus, Saber, worldspan or Galileo, but PNR can also be in the airline's CRS database if a booking is made directly with an airline
 is pienaar ko yatri or sambhddha pathpradarshak pustak ke liye master pienaar kaha jaataa he
 The PNR is identified by a record locator in a particular database
 jab master pienaar ke dharak dwaara yatra ke bhaag pradaan nahin kiye jate, tab pienaar jaankaree kii pratiyaan un airlinon ke siares ke paas pahunchaai jaati hai jo parivahan pradaan karte hai
 These CRS guides open copies of the original PNR in their own database to handle the parts of the book for which they are responsible
 kai airline apane siares ek jidies dwaara yojit karwaati hai, jo pienaar kii saajhedaari kii anumati detaa he
 The record locator of the copied PNR is reported back to the CRS who owns the master PNR, so that all records are tied together
 This allows the PNR to exchange updates when the travel conditions change in any CRS
 haalanki pienaar mul rup se hawaii yatra ke liye shuru kiye gaye the, par ab ye hotel, car kiraye par dene, railway aadi kii booking karwaane ke liye bhi istemaal kiye jate hai
 Colloquially, "PNR" also refers to the specific six-letter record locator used to identify records
 ek takneekee str se, booking puri karne se pehle pienaar ke paanch bhaagon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 They are: ek baar booking is str tak puri ho jaati he to siares ek adwitiya alpha-newmeric record loketor kaa prachaalan karata he, jo aage kiye gaye kisi bhi parivartan kii parvaah kiye bina samaan rahegaa vibhajit ho)
 prayek airline ek vishisht record loketor ke saath apana swayan kaa booking record banaaegi, jo sambhddha airline or siares ke bich samjhaute ke str par nirbhar hoga, yah siares par sanchaarit kiya jayega or booking main store kiya jayega
 While the above list is the minimum requirement, both the passenger and the airline need more information to ensure efficient travel
 inamen shaamil hai: In recent times, many governments now require that the airline provide more information to help investigators track criminals or terrorists
 These include: adhiktar airline yaa yatra agenciyaan ek computer riserveshan system ) yaa global vitaran system ) company jaise sabre, galileo, worldspan or amadeus se apane pienaar kii mezbaani karwaane kaa chayan karti hai
 Some privacy organizations are concerned about the amount of pnr's personal data
 jabaki ek booking puraa karne ke liye nunatam data kaaphi chota hota he, ek pienaar main aamtaur par samvedansheel prakruti kii adhik jaankaree hogi
isamen yatri kaa puraa naam, janm kii taarikh, ghar or kaam kaa pataa, telephone number, i-mail kaa pataa, credit card vivaran or saath hi apaat samparkon ke naam or vyaktigat jaankaree shaamil hogi
 "CRS-GDS companies" created to facilitate "convenient global sharing of PNR data" act as both data repositories and data aggregators and have a relationship with travel data similar to that of the lending department's financial data
 with"
 a canceled or entire travel record is not erased because "PNR copies are purified from live to archival storage systems and can be retained indefinitely by CRS, airlines, and travel agencies

 mukhya vichaar yah he ki iskaa paalan karnaa anivaary nahin he or yah islam main pravesh karne kii shart nahin he
 It is considered mandatory in the Shafi` and Hanbali sects, while the Maliki and Hanafi sects believe that it is only recommended
 haalanki, yah kisi vyakti dwaara islamic paddatiyon ko apanaaye jane ke liye purv-shart nahin he or na hi kisi vyakti dwaara khatna karne se inkaar kiya janaa koi paap he
 It is not one of the five pillars of Islam or the six bases of faith
 haalanki bahaai dharm sakriyata se dharmantariton kii khoj karata he, lekin isamen dharm-parivartan nishiddh he or koi “mishnar” kaary nahin chalaaya jaataa

 While sharing their religion with others, Bahá'ís are alert to "get a hearing" —which means ensuring that the person they are offering to teach is willing to listen to them 
 unke dwaara apanaaye gayi samudaayon main, logon ke saanskrithik aadhaar kaa sthaan lene kaa prayaas karne ke bajaay "bahaai maargdarshakon" ko samaaj main shaamil hone or apane padosiyon ke saath rahane or kaary karne ke dauraan bahaai siddhanton ko lagu karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 The Bahá'í people recognize the divine origin of all religions and believe that these religions arose sequentially as part of a divine plan, and each new revelation replaces and complements its predecessors
 bahaai log apane swayan ke dharm ko naveenatam maanate hai or unka vishwaas he ki isaki shikshaayen – jo ki maanavtaa kii ekaatmata ke siddhant ke aas-paas kendrit he – vaishvik samudaay kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt hai
 In most countries, conversion requires only filling a card declaring faith
 isamen bahoullah – is dharm ke sansthaapak – ko vartmaan samay ke liye ishwar ke doot maanane, unki shikshaaon ke prati jaagruk hone va unhen sweekaar karne, tathaa unke dwaara sthapit sansthaaon va niyamon ke prati aagyaakaari banane kii ghoshnaa shaamil hoti he
 Along with conversion to Bahá'í religion includes a common belief in the common foundations of all known religions, a commitment to the unity of humanity and active service to the community at large, especially in areas that promote unity and friendship
 chunki bahaai dharm main koi purohit nahin hote, atah is dharm main aane vaale dharmantariton ko saamudayik jivan ke sabhi pahaluon main sakriy hone ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 Even a recently converted person can be selected to work in the local spiritual sub-sabha - the guiding Bahai institution at the community level
 hindu dharm dharmantaran kaa samarthan nahin karata or isamen dharmantaran ke liye koi rasm maujuud nahin he
 It is not clearly defined when a person becomes a Hindu because Hinduism has never seen other religions as its rivals
 The belief of many Hindus is that 'to be a Hindu one has to be born as a Hindu' and 'if a person is born as a Hindu, he remains a Hindu forever'; However, Indian law recognizes any person who declares himself to be a Hindu
 According to Hinduism, there is only one absolute truth and there are many paths to "reach" the truth — including the paths followed by other religions
 dharm ke liye sanskrit shabd “maarg” kaa shabdic arth path hota he
 The concept of conversion is a contradiction because Hindu scriptures Vedas and Upanishads consider the whole world to be a family believing the same truth as a deity

 puri atharahavin shatabdi ke dauraan hue samskruthikaran ke parinamswaroop manipur ke adivasee samudaay swayan ko hindu maanane lage
 Recently, the concept of converting people who have converted from Hinduism has become prevalent
 yah punah dharmantaran sadaiv hi anya pramukh dharmon ke prachaarikaran, dharm-parivartan tathaa dharmantaran gatividhiyon ke khatre kii pratikriya ke rup main hi hota rahaa he; anek aadhunik hindu unke dharm se anya dharm main dharmantaran ke vichaar ke khilaaf hai
 The development of Hindu Renaissance movements has resulted in the pace of re-conversion of people who were previously Hindus or whose ancestors were Hindus
 arya samaaj tathaa parishad hindu dharm jaise rashtriya sanghathan aise punah dharmataranon ke dwaara hindu banane kii ichha rakhane waalon kii sahaayta karte hai
 The us-born Hindu guru, Satguru Shivaay Subramuniyaswamy, wrote a book titled How to Bikam a Hindu - a Guide for Seekers and Born Hindus

 In the middle of the 20th century, Bhimrao Ambedkar initiated 10 lakh Hindu Dalits to Buddhism, this huge conversion is the largest conversion in world history
 kshetron or samudaayon kaa buddha dharm main samuhik dharmantaran aaj bhi hota he, udaahranarth, bharat main dalit buddha andolan main sangathit samuhik dharmantaran har varsh lakhon kii sankhya main hote rahe hai
 There may also be exceptions to encourage conversion to some Buddhist movements
 udaahranarth, tibeti buddha dharm main, vartmaan dalai lamas dharmantariton ko jeetne ke sakriy prayaason ko hatotsahit karte hai
 The new religious movements have controversies associated with conversion
 sampradaay-virdohi andolan dwaara vaicharik sudhaar yaa yahaan tak ki mataropan shabd kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 Often they will declare certain nrms as sects
 There are many different definitions of the word sect
 enarem atyadhik vividhtapurna hote hai or yah spasht nahin he ki kya enarem main hone vaala dharmantaran mukhyadhara main hone vaale dharmantaran se bhinn he
 However, it is clear that in the first decade or so of any NRM, the overwhelming majority of its members must have been necessarily converts had there not been a sufficient number of members who grew up in the same, It would not have existed for so long)
 It is also clear that every mainstream religion at the time of its birth must also pass through this phase

 inspector eagle raat main hawamahal ke baad saade nau baje prasaarit hota
 Every week there will be a different story to expose a crime full of mystery and adventure
 aaj doordarshan ho yaa koi niji channel koi na koi dharawahik pryojit kaarykram chalata hi rahata he
 Some stories are drawn for years and some serials have a new story in every issue
 vishay bhi alag-alag he yaa kahen sabhi vishay he - saamaajik samasyaon se lekar, gane bajaane se lekar bhoot chudail or jasusi karnaamon tak
 At the same time, something spicy is served on the same subject and served by the company of those products which have to increase sales
 ab ye sochane vaali baat he ki isaki jade peeche kahaan tak he
 The first such program is - Inspector Eagle
 vaise to pryojit kaaryakramon se shrotaaon kaa parichay radio silon ne karaayaa lekin vahaan gane jaise binaaka geet maala, chutkule shaayari jaise maratha darbar kii mahakati baaten, rochak sawaal jawaab jaise johar ke jawaab yaa es kumars kaa filmi mukadmaa jaise kaarykram the
 But in the form of drama-sponsored serials that have become a part of our lives today due to personal channels, perhaps the first time was Inspector Eagle of Vividh Bharati
 isamen mukhya paatr do the - ek inspector eagle or doosraa havaldaar nayak
 It was sponsored by the company that manufactured the eagle flask and that's why the inspector was named Eagle
 kahani kii maang ke anusaar anya paatr bhi hote
 Every week an interesting anecdote was introduced in the play
 aaj to ek bhi kissa yaad nahin lekin yaad he to havaldaar nayak kii wo adbhut hansi jo khin khin khin se shuru hoti or lambii khinchati jiske bich main hichchach bhi hota
 Then comes the loud voice of Inspector Eagle - the giggling answer of the hawkish hero and the hawkish hero Sorry Sir havaldaar nayak bane the unuus parvaiz jo filmon main charitra bhoomikaayen karte the
 Inspector Eagle was probably played by Dheeraj Kumar who makes the television serial
 chetana kuch jeevadhariyon main swayan ke or apane aasapaas ke vaataavaran ke tatwon kaa bodh hone, unhen samajhane tathaa unki baton kaa moolyankan karne kii shakti kaa naam he
 According to science, consciousness is the feeling that arises from the impulses reaching the brain
 in aavegon kaa arth turant athwa baad main lagaaya jaataa he
 The cerebral cortex has been considered the main sense, or principal place of consciousness, since a very old period
 isamen se bhi purvallat ke kshetra ko vishesh mahatv diya gaya he
 But Penfield and Yaspers explain consciousness in a new way
 unke matanusaar chetana kaa sthaan chetak, adhashchetak or upree mastishk ke upree bhaag ke aasapaas he
 They consider these parts of the brain and their combinations to be the highest level of organization of nerves
 purv lalaat kshetra tathaa adhashchetak ke bich bahirgami naadiyon dwaara sangyojan he
 The combination is direct or indirect
 paroksh sangyojan prishth cendrak ke dwaara hota he
 These pulse are also related to pence
 chetana manushya kii vah visheshta he jo use jivit rakhti he or jo use vyaktigat vishay main tathaa apane vaataavaran ke vishay main gyaan karaati he
 This knowledge is called thinking power
 yahi visheshta manushya main aise kaam karti he jiske kaaran vah jivit praani samajha jaataa he
 Man cannot do any of his physical activities unless he has the knowledge that he will be able to do that action
 koi bhi manushya kisi vighatak padaarth athwa ghatana se bachane ke liye apane kisi ang ko tab tak nahin hilaa saktaa, jab tak ki usko yah gyaan na ho ki koi ghaatak padaarth uske saamne he or usase bachane ke liye vah apane angon ko kaam main laa saktaa he
 For example, we can think of a man who is going towards the river
 yadi vah chalate-chalate nadi tak pahunch jaataa he or nadi main ghus jaataa he to vah duubakar mar jayega
 He cannot stop his walk and cannot save himself from entering the river until the knowledge is produced in his consciousness that he has a river and he can walk on land, but cannot walk on water
 can
 manushya kii sabhi kriyaaon par uparyukt niyam lagu hota he chaahe, ye kriyaayein pehle kabhi hui hon athwa bhavishya main kabhi hon
 Human beings can do any work only because of the inspiration arising from consciousness
 chetana or manushya ke charitra main moulik sambandh he
 Consciousness is the special quality that makes a man alive and character is his entire organization through which the reality of his survival is expressed and through which various functions of life are carried out
 kisi manushya kii chetana or charitra keval usee kii vyaktigat sampatti nahin hote
 These are the result of the social process of many days
 prayek vyakti apane vanshanukram ko swayan main prastut karata he
 He finds special types of rites as ancestral property
 vah itihaas ko bhi swayan main nirupit karata he, kyonki usne vibhinn prakaar kii shiksha tathaa prashikshan ko jivan main paaya he
 Apart from this, he also represents other people by himself, because they have had an impact on his life through his example, preaching and oppression
 jab ek baar manushya kii chetana viksit ho jaati he, tab uski prakritik swatantraaa chali jaati he
 Even in such a state, he is inspired by various motivations and inner instincts, but he cannot publish them freely
 vah yaa to unhen isliye sarvatha dabaa detaa he jisase ki samaaj ke duusare logon kii aavashyaktaaon or ichchhaaon main ve baadhak na bane, athwa unhen is prakaar chapet diya jaataa he, yaa kritrim banaaya jaataa he, jisamen unka prakaashan samajavirohi na ho
 In this way, the human consciousness or prudent mind exercises control over his subconscious, or natural, mind
 manushya or pashu main yahi vishesh bhed he
 This type of control is not there in the life of animals, so they do as they want
 manushya chetanayukta praani he, atev koi bhi kriya karne ke pehle vah uske parinaam ke bare main bhalee prakaar soch letaa he
 From the point of view of psychology, consciousness is the element present in human beings due to which he has all kinds of sensations
 chetana ke kaaran hi ham dekhte, sunate, samajhate or anek vishay par chintan karte hai
 Due to this we also feel happiness and sorrow and due to this we make many kinds of decisions and try to get many things
 maanav chetana kii teen visheshtaayen hai
 She is knowledgeable, emotional and functional
 bhartiya darshanikon ne ise sachchidanand rup kaha he
 The views of modern psychologists confirm the said prohibition
 chetana vah tatv he jisamen gyaan kii, bhav kii or vyakti, arthath kriyasheeltaa kii anubhuti he
 When we know a substance, we are aware of its nature, a dear or unpleasant feeling is born towards it and a desire is created towards it, due to which we either bring it closer to us or remove it away from us
 
 chetana ko darshan main swayamprakash tatv mana gaya he
 Psychology has not yet progressed in the form of consciousness
 chetana hi sabhi padaartho ko, jad chetan, sharir man, nirjeev jivit, mastishk snaayu aadi ko banaati he, unka swaroop nirupit karti he
 Then it is indiscriminate to try to explain consciousness through them
