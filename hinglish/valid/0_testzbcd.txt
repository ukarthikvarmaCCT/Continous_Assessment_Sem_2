 san tak ke bich main 5 varsh vyayateet hue, aisa bhram hota he, jabaki vastut: yah antaraal 4 varsh kaa hi he
 That's why mathematicians and astrologers use other types of calculations in place of this census
 vah is prakaar he ki ve log 1 i

 By this system any BC The number of years spent between the year and any AD year will be impeccable

 Nowadays, generally, there are 365 days in a year and one year is 366 days in every four years
 shatabdiyon ke varshon main 4 shatabdiyon main keval ek shatabdi main 366 din hote hai
 This specific system of centuries was not there in ancient times
 1582 i
 tak shatabdi sahit sab varshon main prati chaar varsh main ek varsh 366 din kaa gina jaataa tha
 The 365-year year is called the normal year and the 366-day year is the leap year
 1582 i

 The first improvement was that centenary days were arranged anew, which is prevalent nowadays
 vyavastha yah hui ki jis shatabdi ko 400 se ni:shesh vibhajit kiya ja sake vahi adhivarsh he; anya sab shatabdiyaan saamaanya varsh hai
 This rule has been done according to the subtle sion yearman derived from modern instruments of astrology
 is niyam kii upeksha se isvi san ke aarambh se 1582 i

 This new system is called the new system and the previous method is called the ancient system

 Gobindpura has a village in Aurangabad district of Magadh division under Bihar state of India
 shwetarktata he rakt yaa asthi majja kaa karkat rog he
 It is characterized by abnormal polygenesis of blood cells, normally white blood cells
 shwetarktata ek vyapak shabd he jisamen rogon kii ek vistrut shrenee shaamil he
 In other forms, it is also a widespread part of the group of diseases known as hematologic tumors
 shwetarktata naidanik or rog vigyaan drushti se vibhinn vishaal samoohon main up-vibhajit he
 The first division is between fatal and long-term forms
 iske atirikt, prabhavit rakt koshika ke prakaar ke anusaar rogon ko up-vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 This division divides leukemia into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemia and myeloid or myelogenous leukemia: in do vargikarnon ko milakar chaar mukhya varg praapt hote hai: Myelogenous leukemia || Fatal myelogenous leukemia) || long term myelogenous leukemia) in mukhya virgon ke bheetar, vishisht rup se vibhinn up-varg hai
 Finally, hairy cell leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia are generally considered outside this classification scheme
 saamaanya asthi majja koshikaon ko ucch sankhyaon vaali aparipakv shwet rakt koshikaon ke dwaara visthapit karne par asthi majja ko hone vaale nuksaan se rakt ke thakka banane kii prakriya main mahatvapurn rakt bimbaanu main kami aati he
 This means that people with leukemia can easily get scratched, have excessive bleeding, or they may also have bleeding from pin pricks
 rogaanuon ke saath ladane vaali shwet rakt koshikaon ko dabaaya ja saktaa he yaa ve dushkriyasheel banaaya ja saktaa he
 This can make the patient's immune system unable to fight simple infections or start attacking other body cells
 chunki shwetarktata pratiraksha pranali ko saamaanya rup se kam karne nahin detaa he, iske kuch marijon ko aksar sankraman kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 It can range from tonsillitis infections, oral lesions or diarrhea to fatal pneumonia and periodic infections
 ant main, laal rakt koshikaon kii kami se anemia hota he, jo saans lene main kathinaayee or avarnataa utpann kar saktaa he
 Some patients may experience other symptoms
 in lakshanon main biimaar mahasoos karnaa, jaise kii bukhaar hona, thithuran, raat main pasinaa aana or flu ke saamaan anya lakshan yaa thakaan mahasoos hona shaamil ho sakate hai
 Some patients experience nausea or heaviness due to enlarged liver and spleen; This can result in an involuntary reduction in weight
 yadi shwetarktata se prabhavit koshika kendriya tantrika tantra par akraman karaati he, tab tantrika sambandhi lakshan utpann ho saktaa he
 All the symptoms associated with leukemia can be attributed to other diseases
 parinamswaroop, shwetarktata ke rog lakshan ko dekhakar uskaa upachaar hameshaa chikitsa jaanch ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Leucorrhoea literally means 'white blood', for this reason the disease has been given the name leukemia, in which a large number of white blood cells are found in the examination done before treatment in most patients
 jab rakt ke namoonay ko kisi sookshmdarshi main dekha jaataa he to badi sankhya main shwet rakt koshikaayen spasht rup se dikhaai detii he
 Often, these extra white blood cells are immature or dysfunctional
 koshikaon kii atyadhik sankhya anya koshikaon ke str main bhi baadha daal sakati he, jisase rakt ke pariman main ek nuksaandaayak asantulan utpann hota he
 In some patients, white blood cells do not show an overdose in some patients with leukemia at the time of regular blood count
 is durlabh sthiti ko aleukemia kaha jaataa he
 Cancerous white blood cells are now found in the bone marrow, which impedes the normal formation of blood cells
 haalanki, leukemia prabhavit koshikaayen rakt pravaah main shaamil hone ke badale main majja main hi pai jaati hai, jahaan ve rakt parikshan main dikhaai detii hai
 For a patient with alukemia, white blood cell numbers in the bloodstream may be normal or low
 aleukemia leukemia ke chaar pramukh prakaaron main se kisi main bhi ho saktaa he or yah khaas taur par royendaar koshika vaali leukemia main saamaanya rup se paayi jaati he
 There is no single known cause of all the different types of leukemia
 vibhinn leukemia ke sambhawatah alag-alag kaaran ho sakate hai
 Known causes include natural and artificial unregulated radiation, viruses found in humans such as human T-lymphotropic viruses, and certain chemical substances, particularly benzene and alkyl group chemotherapy agents for previous malignant tissue groups
 tambaakoo kaa seven vayaskon main ghaatak miloid leukemia viksit karne ke jokhim main vruddhi karne se sambandhit he
 Some cases of maternal-fetal transmission have been reported
 anya karkat kii tarah, leukemia, DNA ke shaareerik utparivartanon ke parinamswaroop utpann hota he jo onkogens ko sakriya karata he yaa tumor ko dabaane vaale jeenon ko niskriy karata he or koshika mrityu, vibhedikaran or vibhaajan ke niyantran main baadha daalata he
 These changes may occur spontaneously or may occur due to exposure to ionizing radiation or carcinogenic substances and may be influenced by genetic factors
 shodhakartaaon ke samooh or vishay niyantran adhyayanon ne petroracyanon jaise ki benzene or kesh rangane ke padaarthon ke saath sampark ko leukemia ke kuch roopon ke vikaas ke saath joda he
 Viruses have also been linked to some varieties of leukemia
 udhaaharan ke liye, ALL ke kuch maamle yaa to maanav pratirakshi nunata vishaanu yaa maanav T-limphotropic vishaanu dwaara janit sankraman se sambandhit hai
 However, one report suggests that exposure to certain germs may protect children to some degree from leukemia
 kuch logon main leukemia viksit hone kii anuvanshik pravriti hoti he
 This trend is reflected in family histories and paired studies
 prabhavit logon main sammilit rup se ek yaa ek se adhik jin ho sakate hai
 In some cases, families have a tendency to develop the same type of leukemia as other members; In other families, various types of leukemia or associated blood cancer may develop in the affected people
 in anuvanshik vishyon ke alaava gunasutra sambandhi asaamanyataon vaale yaa kuch anya anuvanshik sthitiyon vaale logon main leukemia kaa adhik se adhik khatra hota he
 For example, people affected by congenital pathology have a high risk of developing types of malignant leukemia
 phankoni anemia se ghaatak miloid leukemia hone kaa khatra hota he
 Studies have been conducted for decades to ascertain the causes of leukemia from non-ionized radiation
 antarrashtriya agency ne cancer visheshgy kaary samooh ke sambandh main anusandhan karne vaali prakritik rup se ghatit hone vaale or utpaadan, sanchaaran or vidyut shakti ke upyog ke sahyog se hone vaale sthir vidyut or atyant nimna aavriti vaali vidyutchumbakeey urja ke dwaara ekatrit kiye gaye sabhi aankadon kii vistrut samiksha kii
unhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki is baat ke bahut simit pramaan hai ki ucch str vaale ELF chumbakeey kshetra bachapan main hone vaali leukemia kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Children exposed to these high levels of magnetic fields may be at twice the risk of leukemia due to exposure to significant ELF magnetic fields
 haalanki report yah bhi batalaata he ki in adhyayanon main paae jane vaali paddatimulak kamajoriyon or purvagrahon ne sambhawatah badhaakar kahe jane kaa jokhim utpann kiya hai
 There has been no evidence of association with leukemia in adults or any other form of malignancy
 chunki elfs ke aise staron ke saath sampark apekshaakrit rup se asaamaanya he, vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne yah nishkarsh nikaalata he ki ELF ke saath sampark, yadi baad main kaaryakari siddh hua, to vishwa bhar main prativarsh aise sirf 100 se 2400 maamle hi honge, jo us varsh kii kul ghatana ke 0
2 se 4
95% jaahir karenge
 Until the cause of leukemia is detected, there is no way to prevent the disease
 kaarnon kaa pataa chal jane ke baad bhi, unhen tunrat niyantrit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, jaise ki prakritik rup se hone vaale prishthika vikiran or isliye ve vishesh rup se rokthaam ke uddeshyon main sahaayak nahin hote hai
 Most types of leukemia are treated with pharmacological therapy
 kuch kaa upachaar vikiran chikitsa ke dwaara bhi kiya jaataa he
 In some cases, a bone marrow transplant is useful
 imatinib, jo ki ek tyrocine kinage inhibitor he, leukemia ke upachaar mai upyogi siddh hua he
 The management of ALL focuses on bone marrow control and systemic disease
 iske atirikt, upachaar ke dwaara leukemia se prabhavit koshikaon ko anya hisson, khaas kar kendriya tantrika tantra, jaise ki qamar sambandhi suraakh main failane se avashya rokna chahie
 saamaanya rup se, in sabhi upachaaron ko kai charnon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he Treatment decision Hematologists place CLL treatment based on both stage and individual patient's disease symptoms
 CLL marijon ke ek bade samooh main nimna koti kii beemaari hoti he, jisamen upachaar se laabh nahin hota he
 Individuals affected by CLL related complications or more advanced disease often benefit from treatment
 saamaanya rup se, upachaar ke bindu is prakaar hai: The specific treatment method CLL is probably incurable by current treatments
 praathmik taur par chemotherapy sambandhi upachaar main sangyojan chemotherapy ke saath chlorambusil yaa saichlophosphomide or saath hi saath ek corticosteroid jaise ki prednison yaa prednisolon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The use of a corticosteroid has the added advantage of suppressing certain related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immuno-mediated thrombocytopenia
 In immune situations, nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful agents of single treatment
 
 yuva marij anuvaanshik rup se bhinn yaa apane sharir se hi autologs asthi majja ke pratyaropan ke bare main vichaar kar sakate hai
 Many different cancer-resistant drugs are effective for the treatment of AML
 marij kii umr ke anusaar or AML ke vishesh upsvarupon ke anusaar upachaar alag-alag hote hai
 Overall, the strategy is to prevent bone marrow-related and systemic disease, while specific treatment of the central nervous system if ingested
 saamaanya rup se, adhikansh karkat rog visheshgy chemotherapy ke aarambhik preran charan ke liye aushadhiyon ke sammishran par bharosa karte hai
 Such blending chemotherapies generally provide the benefit of early reduction in bone marrow deposition and lower risk of resistance to disease
 asthi majja main ghanibhutikaran or dekh-rekh sambandhi upachaaron kaa uddeshy beemaari kii punrariti ko rokna he
 In addition to frequent chemotherapy, intensive chemotherapy with drugs is unavoidable for the treatment of condensation in the bone marrow
 iske vipareet, dekh-rekh sambandhi upachaar main aushadhiyon kii vah khuraaq di jaati he jo preran charan ke dauraan prayukt hoti he
 There are many possible treatments for CML, but standard care is imatinib therapy to diagnose new patients by observing disease symptoms
 adhikansh karkat pratirodhi aushadhiyon kii tulana main, iske apekshaakrit rup se kam parshv prabhaav hote hai or inhen gharon main maukhik rup se khaaya ja saktaa he
 With this drug, more than 90% of patients will be able to control the disease for at least five years, so that CML will become a long-term, controllable condition
 adhik badi hui or aniyantrit sthiti main, jab rogi imetinib sahan nahin kar saktaa he, yaa yadi rogi ek sthaayee upachaar kii ichha vyakt karata he, to anuvanshik rup se bhinn asthi majja pratyaropan kiya ja saktaa he
 This procedure involves high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy as well as infusion of the bone marrow from a compatible donor
 lagbhag 30% rogi is prakriya main mar jate hai
 Treatment decision: Patients affected by leukemia with no hair, no symptoms of this disease, are not treated as soon as possible
 upachaar par vichaar karnaa aamtaur par tabhi aavashyak samajha jaataa he jab marij main is rog ke sanket or lakshan jaise ki rakt koshika ki sankhyaon main kami se kam, aksar sankraman, akthith kharonch, anemia, yaa thakaan mahasoos hona jo marij ke dainik jivan ko baadhit karne ke liye paryaapt ho
 Specific treatment method Patients who require treatment are usually given pantostatin daily for up to four weeks by either cladribine or intravenous infusion within the skin by either intravenous infusion or normal injection into the skin
 
 adhikansh sthitiyon main, upachaar ke ek daur se dirghakaalin raahat milegaa
 Other treatments include intravenous infusion of rituzimab or self-injection of interferon-alpha
 simit sthitiyon main, rogi ko shalya-kriya dwaara pleeha nikaale jane kii kriya se laabh pahunch saktaa he
 These treatments are not typically offered as first treatments because their success rates are lower than cladribine or pantostatin
 tii-cell prolimphosaitic leukemia, jo ki ek viral or teji se failanevaali leukemia he or jisamen jivit rahane kii dar kaa ausat ek varsh se bhi kam hoti he, ke adhikansh marijon ko atisheeghra upachaar kii zarurat hoti he
 T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is difficult to treat and is not compatible with most available chemotherapy drugs
 kuch rogiyon main simit safalataa ke saath anek vibhinn prakaar ke upachaaron ke prayaas kiye ja chuke hai: purine samadharmi, chlorambusil or sammishran chemotherapy ke vibhinn prakaar 
 shwet rakt koshikaon par akraman karne vaale alemtuzumaib ek ekal-praturup pratirakshi kaa prayog upachaar main pichley vikalpon kii apeksha adhik badi safalataa ke saath kiya gaya he
 Some patients who successfully demonstrate compatibility with this treatment also have cell tube transplantation to reinforce the compatibility
 leukemia ke kaarnon, nidaan, upachaar or roganidan ke sambandh main mahatvapurn anusandhan kiye ja rahe hai
 Hundreds of clinical investigations are being planned or are being done from time to time
 marijon kii jivan style main sudhaar karte hue, yaa asthi majja ke jamaav main kami laane main yaa upachaar ke baad uchit dekhbhaal karte hue, adhyayan upachaar ke prabhavi sadhano, is beemaari ke ilaaj ke behatar tareekon par dhyaan kendrit karegaa
 Around 256,000 children and adults worldwide suffered from leukemia in 2000 and 209,000 died in the world
 yah us varsh karkat se hone vaali lagbhag sattar lakh mrityuon ke lagbhag 0
3% hisse ko darshata he or kisi bhi kaaran se hone vaali sabhi mrityuon kaa lagbhag 0
35% he
 When compared to the body at sixteen different sites, leukemia is the 12th most common class of diseases and the 11th most common cause of cancer death due to abnormal tissue growth
 sanyukt rajya america main lagbhag 245,000 log kisi na kisi prakaar ke leukemia se prabhavit hai
 These include those who have been provided relief or who have been recovered
 sanyukt rajya america main 2008 ke varsh main leukemia ke lagbhag 44,270 nae maamalon kaa nidaan kiya gaya tha
 One-third of children with one type of cancer are patients with a particular type of leukemia, malignant lymphoblastic leukemia
 
vayaskon main ilaaj kiye jane vaale keval 3% karkat leukemia hota he, lekin chunki karkat vayaskon main adhik paaya jaataa he, vayaskon main 90% se adhik sabhi prakaar kii leukemia kaa ilaaj kiya jaataa he

 He is the second best in the trilogy of the best Sanskrit poetry

 Magha is often considered by the Sanskrit critics and scholars to be a brilliant omniscient scholar
 darshanashastra, sangitshastra tathaa vyakaranshastra main unki vidvatta thi
 His scholasticism was not one-sided, but was omnipresent
 atev unhen 'pandit-kavi' bhi kaha gaya he
 The full-blown form of the "ornate style" promoted by Mahakavi Bharavi is found in Magh's epic 'shishupalavadha', which had a great influence on later poets
 unke 'shishupalavadh' ke prayek paksh kii visheshta kaa bahut gaharaa saahitiyik adhyayan sanskrit vidwaanon va shikshavidon dwaara kiya gaya he
 Pt Baldev Upadhyaya has said about him - This idealized fantasy of an ornate epic is an unforgettable contribution to the Sanskrit literature of Mahakavi Magha, whose poetry literature has been enriched, enriched and cultured by following and enunciating it
 magh kii prashansha main kaha gaya he- Anand is a 1971 Hindi language film
 is film ke nirmaataa, nirdeshak, lekhak evam sampadak rishikesh mukherjee hai
 The lead actors of this film are Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan
 is film ko rashtriya film puraskaar main sarvshereshth film ke alaava filmafere puraskaron main chah shreniyon main puraskrit kiya gaya tha
 The film begins from the present and Dr
 Bhaskar Banerjee, an expert in cancer, is being awarded the literary award that he created a novel like Anand and Dr
 Bhaskar Banerjee in his cleanliness says that it is some pages of his diary And he is not an author and this novel is based on true events
 ab film ateet main chali jaati he jab ek jujharu doctor bhaskar bannerjee mumbai kii jhoparpatti main marizon kii dekhbhaal kar rahaa he or dekhtaa he ki bhukhmaree or badahaali is had tak faili huyi he ki vah kisi ke liye kuch bhi karne main aksham he
 At the same time, his friend Dr
 Prakash Kulkarni has a frozen hospital, which also sees the sick patients and gets good amount of money from them while the poor patient, who keeps sending Bhaskar, gets all the tests done without any money
 ek din prakaash ko dilli se uske ek stri rog visheshgy dost dow trivedi kaa khat aata he ki vah apane dost anand ko uske paas bhej rahaa he
 Prakash met Anand a few years ago and became his good friend
 anand ko antadiyon kaa cancer he or yah baat vah jaanata he ki zyaada se zyaada vah chah maheene hi zindaa rahegaa
 When Prakash and Bhaskar are sitting in Prakash's office, Anand threatens and starts his joking habit, which makes Bhaskar Banerjee angry and he asks Anand that he knows what
 If there is sickness, Anand tells him that he has cancer and that he will live for six months at most
 yah sunakar bhaskar anand kaa qaayal ho jaataa he ki yah maaloom hote huye bhi ki vah kuch hi dinon kaa mahamaan he, anand itnaa zindadil he
 Anand now lives at Bhaskar's house and somehow discovers that Bhaskar loves a girl Renu but does not dare to express this love
 anand ek pahalwaan kii madad se renu kii maan se milakar bhaskar or renu kaa rishta pakkaa karvaa letaa he lekin renu kii maan ko yah bataa detaa he ki bhaskar or renu kii shaadi main vah nahin rahegaa
 Meanwhile, Anand also finds Isa Bhai Suratwala, an artist working in the theater and Anand learns some dialogues and tapes them in Bhaskar's tape recorder
 ab anand kii tabiyat din par din girti jaati he or ek din vah bistar par let jaataa he
 Bhaskar goes to a homoeopathic doctor in search of some charisma and leaves Prakash and Renu to take care of the joy behind him but by the time he returns, the joy is dead and the joyful taped dialogue in the background
 It is going on and this is where the film ends

 sinhalai bhashaa srilanka main boli jane vaali sabase badi bhashaa he
 Tamil is the most spoken language in Sri Lanka after Sinhalese
 praaia: aisa nahin hota ki kisi desh kaa jo naam ho, vahi us dash main basane vaali jati kaa bhi ho or vahi naam us jati dwaara vyavahrut hone vaali bhashaa kaa bhi ho
 The specialty of Sinhala island is that the caste settled in it has been called "sinhala" and the language used by that caste is also "sinhala"
 anek bhartiya bhashaaon kii lipiyon kii tarah sinhal bhashaa kii lipi bhi brahmi lipi kaa hi parivartit viksit rup hai or jis prakaar urdu kii varnmaala ke atirikt devanagari sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon kii varnmaala he, usee prakaar devanagari hi sinhal bhashaa kii bhi varnmaala he
 Sinhala language has two forms - Shuddha Sinhala and Mixed Sinhala
 shuddh sinhal ko keval battis akshar maanya rahe hai- The oldest grammar book of Sinhala (siddatsangra) is of the opinion that the quantities of, and ai-a, and Aa are incremental quantities
 vartmaan mishrit sinhal ne apni varnmaala ko na keval paali varnmaala ke aksharon se samrudh kar liya he, balki sanskrit varnmaala main bhi jo or jitne akshar adhik the, un sab ko bhi apana liya he
 Thus the number of letters in the present mixed Sinhala is fifty four
 attharah akshar "swar" tathaa shesh chhattis akshar vyanjan maane jate hai
 When two letters are congruent, this process is called "pact"
 shuddh sinhal main sandhiyon ke keval das prakaar maane gaye hai
 But in modern Sinhala, the treaty or treaty of Sanskrit words is done according to the rules of Sanskrit grammar
 "ekakshar" athwa "anekaksharon" ke samooh padon ko bhi sanskrit kii hi tarah chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he - namay, aakhyaat, upsarg tathaa nipaat
 Like Hindi in Sinhala, there are two words - "singular" and "plural"
 sanskrit kii tarah ek atirikt "dwivachan" nahin hota
 The distinction of this "singular" and "plural" is called number distinction
 jis prakaar "vachan" ko lekar "hindi" or "sinhal" kaa samya he usee prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki "ling" ke vishay main bhi hindi or shuddh sinhal samandharma he
 There are only three men - first man, middle man and best man
 teenon purushon main vyavahrut hone vaale sarvanaamon ke aath kaarak hai, jinaki apni-apni vibhaktiyaan hai
 The "karan" factor is often counted after "karma", but the "karta" factor between "karma" and "karan" is counted among the eight factors of Sinhala
 "sambodhan" kaarak nahin hone se "kartri" kaarak ke baavjood karkon kii ginati aath hi rahati he
 The head of the sentence assumes "action", because no statement is formed in the absence of a verb
 yon sinhal vyakaran adhikansh baton main sanskrit kii anukriti maatr he
 Even then, there are neither "parasmappad" nor "atmanapada" like Sanskrit nor ten lotus etc
 sinhal main kriyaaon ke ye aath prakaar maane gaye hai- At the time of speaking and speaking the Sinhala language, like our Bhojpuri dialects, it is very easy in terms of suffixes, but equally difficult in writing and reading
 bolne-chaalane main yanava kriyaapad se hi jaataa hoon, jate hai, jaataa he, jate ho, jaataa he, jate hai ityadi hi nahin, jayega, jaaenge aadi sabhi kriyaswaroopon kaa kaam ban jaataa he
 Gender discrimination is considered as a zigzag for Hindi students
 sinhal bhashaa is drushti se badi saral he
 There you can use the word "hond" synonymous with the word "good" for both "boy" and "girl"
 prayek bhashaa ke muhaavarey uske apane hote hai
 It is useless to find their exact synonym in other languages
 to bhi anubhav samya ke kaaran do bhinn jatiyon dwaara boli jane vaali do bhinn bhashaaon main ek jaisi milti-julati kahavatein uplabdh ho jaati hai
 There is sufficient uniformity in Sinhala and some idioms and proverbs in Hindi
 uttar bharat kii ek se adhik bhashaaon se milti-julati sinhal bhashaa kaa vikaas un shilalekhon kii bhashaa se hua he jo i
 pus
 duusari teesri shatabdi ke baad se lagaataar uplabdh he
 Two hundred years after Lord Buddha's Parinirvana, Ashokaputra Mahendra reached Sinhala Island, according to "mahavansh" he preached in the island language to the people of Sinhala Island
 mahamati mahendra apane saath "buddhavachan" kii jo parampara laae the, vah maukhik hi thi
 That tradition must have been either a "magadhi" of Buddha's time, or a "prakrit" of two hundred years later that Mahendra Sthavira himself would have spoken
 sinhal itihaas kii manyata he ki mahendra sthavir apane saath na keval tripitak kii parampara laae the, balki unke saath uske bhashyon athwa uski atthakathaon kii parampara bhi
 Those chronicles were later translated into Sinhala

 Meanwhile, his fingers were cut off due to his hand coming in the middle of the machine, but he tolerated the pain quietly because there was a fear of being caught when he went out to the doctor for treatment
 
 After this Madanlal Pahwa came in association with Vishnu Karkare of Hindu Mahasabha through Dada Maharaj

 When Siddhanta comes back and sees his future again, he sees the same thing again
 wo sisitivi se krish ko uske dweep main jivit dekh kar dang rah jaataa he
 When Krish comes in, a lot of goons attack him, but he defeats them all, when Sidhant shoots Vikram's head and shows that Priya and Rohit are in his possession

 sandhi ne yah kaha ki koi bhi hastakshar karne vaala na to apane daawey se hat rahaa he, na kisi or kaa daawa maan rahaa he or na hi koi nayaa daawa karegaa
 For example, France considers the region called Adeli Earth of Antarctica as part of it, but under the treaty it is unable to convince this claim from anyone else

 mayawati yaa algol, jiskaa bair naam betaa parasai he, yayati taramandal kaa doosraa sab se roshan tara he
 It is also the 59th brightest star among the stars visible to the earth
 yah ek aisa dwitara he jiske mukhya taare ke ird-gird ghumta saathi tara kabhi to uske or prithvi ke bich aa jaataa he or kabhi nahin
 With this, it seems to be a variable star from the earth whose brightness varies
 vaidic kaal main isaki mayavi badalati prakruti ke kaaran hi iskaa naam "mayawati" padaa
 It was considered a star of misfortune in Western and Arab cultures
 yah prithvi se lagbhag 93 prakaash varsh kii duuri par he
 Although its brightness seen from Earth remains at +2
10 magnitude, but after 2 hours and 49 minutes every 2 days, its brightness falls to +3

 mayawati taare ko angrezi main "algal" kehete he
 It is derived from the Arabic "ras al-gul", which means "the head of a demon"
 ise angrezi main "demen star" bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is also called "rosh Ha Satan" in the Hebrew language
 pashchimi or arabi sabhyataa main is taare kaa sambandh dushtataa or durbhaagya se joda gaya he
 Mayawati is a Dwitara mandala, around which a third star revolves around two stars, that is, three stars are known in this division together: jab mayawati mandal kaa shuru main adhyayan kiya gaya to khagolashastriyon ko ek baat dekh kar hairaani hui
 Normally, two stars of a given star are born at the same time, and whatever star has the most mass, nuclear fusion moves more quickly
 is se adhik dravyaman vaala tara zyaada jaldi boodha jo jaataa he
 But in Mayawati a and Mayawati b it is the reverse: the mass star is still in the main sequence and is hot, while the low mass product is more old and has cooled down
 ise "algol prashan" bulaayaa jane laga
 Later it became known that in fact Mayawati b used to be bigger than today, but when it grew old, Mayawati a pulled her outer layer and mixed a lot of her mass into it and now it has more mass than B
 aaj se 73 lakh varsh pehle mayawati hamaare saura mandal ke 9
8 prakaash-varsh dur se guzaaraa tha
 At that time it must have been more illuminating than the Huntsman star in the earth's sky, although humans were not present on earth to see it
 iskaa hamaare saura mandal par gurutvkarshak prabhaav bhi padaa hoga or vaigyanik maanate hai ki us kaal main isane hamaare saura mandal ke aurt badal se kuch dhoomaketuon ko bhi andar ke grahon kii ore phenkaa hoga
 Then over time it went away from us and today it is 92

 yah bhautikee evam ejiniyari ke anekanek kshetron main prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example in circuit analysis
 isko l { f } { \ displaystyle \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {L}} \ left \ {f \ right \ }} se nirupit karte hai
 This is a linear operation that converts the function f with the actual argument t into the function f with a complex argument
 laplas roopaantar, prasiddh ganitagya khagolvid pier simon laplas ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Laplace transform is used to solve differential equations and integral equations
 anubandh yah he ki uparokt samakalan kaa astitv ho
 The Laplace transform defined as above is called 'unilateral Laplace transform'
 laplas roopaantar kaa dwipaksheeya roopaantar nimnlikhit prakaar se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he- Note: u { \ displaystyle u} means unit step function f = lim s → ∞ s f { \ displaystyle f= \ lim _{s \ to \ infty }{sf}} f = lim s → 0 s f { \ displaystyle f = \ lim _ {s \ to 0} {sf}} pratilom laplas roopaantar neeche die gaye samishra samakal dwaara nikaala ja saktaa he
 There are many names of this samakal, such as Bromwich Samakal, furye-melin Samakal or Melin's inverse Sutra: jahaan γ ek vaastavik sankhya he taaki samakal kaa contur-path kanvargens ke kshetra f ke andar ho
 Another formula for extracting the inverse Laplace transform is the inverse formula of the post

 The number of radioactive atoms in a sample is n and its rate of decay is proportional to N
 isi ko nimnlikhit avakal sameekaran dwaara abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he- Where λ is the decay constant
 is sameekaran kaa hal laplas roopaantar kii sahaayta se nikaala ja saktaa he
 By writing this equation on one side, ab ham is sameekaran ke donon pakshon kaa laplas roopaantar lete hai
 Where tathaa On solving this, ant main ham pratilom laplas roopaantar lete hen jisase saamaanya hal praapt hota he
 Laplace transforms are often used in the analysis of transient circuits
