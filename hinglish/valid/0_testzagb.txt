 athsha m, ek poorak vatu vah hoti he jaska tarodh nakramak hota he
 It is opposite to an alternate object
 athaat kasi ay vatu k kamat ghatane par, vatu k maang m badhor hoti he
 Conversely, when the price of an item increases, the demand for the item decreases in demand for the object
 If objects a and b are complementary to each other, increasing the price of a will lead to a demand to the left due to which demand of the object b He will come in
 That means the demand for both items will decrease
 If the price of object a decreases, the demand of item a will go to the right and due to which the demand of object a will go towards and out
 That is, the demand for both items will increase
 This means that the demands of the two objects are related to each other
 yad ek k maang badhati he to duusare k maang bhi badhegi or yad ek k maang ghatati he to duusare vatu k maang bhi ghat jaaegi | poorak vatuon k kamat ek duusare se isi tarah sambandhat hoti he
 If the cost of one thing increases, then the cost of other things also increases and vice versa
 iske vaparat vaikipak vatuon m kamat or maang ek vatu k doosar vatu se vaparat tarke se sambandhat hoti he | athaat yad ek vatu k kamat or maang bad jaati he to duusare vatu k kamat or maang ghategi | If two objects complement each other, they experience a joint demand
 For example, the demand for razor lead depends on the number of knives
 yah kaaran he k kabhi kabhi rager lead k maang m vridh karne ke lae chure ko nuksaan m bechaa jaataa he
 
 bhojan k khapat m haal ha m kae hue anusandhan ke vaara yah, manovainak yaa pat hui he k kaise ek vatu k khapat uske poorak k khapat ko asar karata he
 Consumption of a food or drink indicates consumption of its complementary consumption
 cola upabhotaaon ko 'ek chizbgar ke lae ek vauchar ke lae bhugtan karne k ichaa bad jaati he
 An example of this is the demand for hot dogs and hot dogs
 The supply and demand for hot dogs is stated in the diagram, in which the initial demand for hot dogs is D1
 maan lize k hot dog k ranbhak kamat P1 he or usak ranbhak maang Q1 he
 If the price of a hot dog becomes less than a certain amount, the demand for hot dogs will increase due to this decrease
 Due to increase in demand, demand will move outward
 Ie new position on D2
 If we consider a continuous supply S, then the new demand for hot dogs will be D2 and the new price will be P2
 By this example it can be said that complementary objects are those which are consumed together
 athath yad kasi ek vatu k maang badhati he to duusare k maang bhi bad jaati he
 Other examples include: adash poorak vatu vah hoti he jaska seven duusare ke saath hameshaa karnaa padataa he
 The ideal shows the apathy and a right angle of the complementary object
 is tarah k varayataaon ko asar ek laontf upyogta samaaroh se tandhav kayaa jaataa he
 In real world some objects behave as a perfect complement
 For example: shoes | Left and right toe shoes are always sold in pairs
 The ratio of left and right toe shoes is always the same
 poorakta k di kaa aapasi hona jar nahan he
 This can be achieved by cross-elasticity

 kuch tarah k kamat par ranneet poorak vatuon or muy vatu par banaai jaati he : In psychology, the behavioral process of balancing conflicting needs is called adjustment

 Jaitley recalled that Arun Jaitley, a minister in the Dinmodi government, was also a prisoner of MISA
 Recalling those days, Jaitley wrote, 'I had the distinction of organizing the only protest on the morning of 26 June 1975 and i became the first Satyagrahi against the Emergency
 i did not feel that at the age of 22 i was involved in the events that were going to be a part of history
 This incident changed the future of my life
 By evening, i was locked up as a MISA prisoner in Tihar Jail
 'with the imposition of the Emergency, a list of people who were to be arrested was made
 The first names in this list were Jayaprakash Narayan and Morarji Desai
 Indira's younger son Sanjay Gandhi was entrusted with the task of preparing this list
 JP and Morarji Desai were put in jail under MISA before dawn
 The story of Daman continued for the next 21 months
 The opposition prisoners who were ready in the jail did suffer torture in the jails but these prisoners also started to evict the Indira government from power
 From JP, leaders like Chandrashekhar, Vajpayee, George Fernandes, Lalu Yadav, LK Advani, Sharad Yadav ousted the Indira government from power as soon as they came out of jail
 The battle of opposition leaders reached a decisive point
 The Janata Party was formed under Morarji Desai and the first non-congress government was formed in 1977
 Indira herself lost the election to Rae Bareli and the Congress was reduced to 153 seats
 With the formation of the new government, the oppressive law MISA was removed
 Pension to MISA detainees Even during the Emergency, the government of non-congress states used to give pension to the people who were closed in MISA
 In Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP governments started giving pension of 15,000 rupees to prisoners held in DRI and MISA
 After this, in 2014, Vasundhara Raje government of Rajasthan also decided to give a pension of Rs 12 thousand per month to 800 MISA prisoners
 BJP still honors MISA prisoners throughout the country on the anniversary of the Emergency

 "there is one Truth that shines through all of creation
 Rivers and mountains, plants and animals, Mata Amritanandamayi Devi is a Hindu spiritual leader and guru whom her followers revere as a saint and is also known by the name of "amma", "ammachi" or "mother"
 unki maanavtaavaadi gatividhiyon ke liye unhen vyapak str par sammaan praapt he
 Sometimes they are also referred to as "lovingly embracing saints"
 mata amritanandmayi math ke upaadhyaksh swami amruthasvarupanand puri ke anusaar, "ammaa ke liye dusron ke dukh ko dur karnaa utana hi swaabhaavik he jaise ki apni ankhon ke aansu pochhna
 Amma is happy in the happiness of others
 dusron kii suraksha main hi ammaa apni suraksha maanati hai
 Amma's rest is in the rest of others
 yahi ammaa kaa sapana he
 And this is the dream for which the mother has dedicated her life towards the awakening of humanity
 " Mata Amritanandamayi Devi was born in 1953 as Sudhamani Idamannel in Alappadh Panchayat, District Kollam, Kerala, a small village in Prateekavu
 9 varsh kii aayu main unka vidhyalay janaa band ho gaya tha or ve puure samay apane chote bhai-bahanon kii dekhbhaal or gharelu kaam karne lageen
 As a part of these tasks, Sudhamani Idmannel used to collect the leftover food from his neighbors for his family's cows and goats
 ammaa bataati hai ki un dinon ve atyadhik nirdhantaa or anya logon ke kashton ke kaaran atyadhik dukh se guzar rahi thim
 She brought clothes and food for these people from her home
 unka parivaar, joki dhanwaan nahin tha, iske liye unhen daantata tha or dandit karata tha
 Amma sometimes suddenly hugged people to give them relief from grief
 jabaki us samay ek 14 varsh kii kanya ko kisi ko bhi sparsh karne kii ajna nahin di jaati thi, khaas taur par purushon ko sparsh karne kii
 But Amma continued to do the same despite receiving adverse reactions from her parents
 dusron ko gale lagane kii baat par ammaa ne kaha, "mai yah nahin dekhati ki vah ek stri he yaa purush
 mai kisi ko bhi swayan se bhinn rup main nahin dekhati
 mujhase sansar kii sabhi rachanaaon kii ore ek nirantar prem dhara bahati he
 This is my innate nature
 ek chikitsak kaa kartavya rogiyon kaa upachaar karnaa hota he
 "similarly my duty is to comfort those who are in trouble
 " Amma rejected all the requesters despite her parents' many attempts to marry her
 1981 main, jab anekon jigyaasu paryakadvu main aakar ammaa ke shishy banane ke liye unke mata-pita kii sampatti main rahane lage to, ek vishwastareey sanghathan, mata amritanandmayi math kii sthapana kii gayi
 Amma was the president of this monastery
 aaj mata amritanandmayi math anekon aadhyatmik or dharmarth gatividhiyon main sanlagn he
 In 1987, at the request of her devotees, Amma started organizing programs in all the countries of the world
 Since then she does so every year
 ve desh jahaan ammaa ke kaarykram yojit ho chuke hai uname nimna desh shaamil hai: australia, austria, brazil, canada, chile, dubai, england, finland, frans, germany, holand, ireland, italy, japan, kenya, kuwait, malaysia, morishas, reunion, rashia, singapore, spain, srilanka, sweden, switzarland or sanyukt rajya america
 ve prativarsh bharat main vaarshik bhraman bhi karti hai
 In Sanskrit, philosophy means 'to see'
 In Hindu traditional practice, it refers to seeing a holy person or object
 adarsh rup main yah kisi mandir main ek ishwar kii chhavi main us pavitra vyakti yaa vastu ke darshan ke sadrush hota he
 In viewing the image of a deity, the spectators acquire the powers of that deity through their eyes
 atah darshan main, darshannkarta ko saubhaahgya, kalyaan or ishwariya prabhaav pradaan karne kii kshamta hoti he
 The followers of Amma use this word for a very demanding ritual of loving embrace
 ammaa apni kishoravastha se hi is tarah se darshan de rahi hai
 In relation to how this practice started, Amma says, "people used to come here and tell about their problems
 ve rote the or main unke aansu poncha karti thi
 When they used to cry in my lap, i hugged them
 phir aglaa vyakti bhi mujhase aise hi vyavhaar kii ummid rakhata tha
 

and in this way it became custom
 " ammaa kaa sanghathan, mata amritanandmayi math yah daawa karata he ki ammaa ne is duniya ke 29 million se bhi adhik logon ko apane gale se lagaaya he
 · jab san 2002 main unase yah poocha gaya ki unhen kya lagata he unka aalingan kis had tak duniya ke bimaaron kii sahaayta karata he? ammaa ne kaha, "main yah nahin kahati ki main inaki samasyaon kaa 100 pratishat samaadhaan kar sakati hum
 is sansar ko parivartit karne kaa prayaas karnaa thik vaisaa hi he jaise kute kii tedi poonch ko sidhaa karnaa
 lekin logon se hi samaaj kaa janm hota he
 Therefore, by influencing people, you can bring change in this society and through this change can be brought in this world
 aap parivartan laa sakate hai, par ise puri tarah parivartit nahin kar sakate
 prayek vyakti ke mashtishk main chalane vaala yuddh hi vaastavik yudhon ke liye uttaradaayi he
 So if you can touch people, you can also touch this world
 " This philosophy of Amma is the center of her life as she meets people almost daily since the late 1970s
 iske saath hi ammaa kaa aashirwad paane ke liye aane vaale logon kii sankhya main nirantar vruddhi ho rahi he, kabhi-kabhi to aisa bhi hota he ki vah lagaataar 20 ghanton tak darshan detii rahati hai
 In a 2004 book From Amma's Heart, Amma says in the inscribed dialogue; "as long as my hands will be able to move even a little and reach the people who come to me, and as long as i have the power to put my hand on the shoulder of a crying person and to turn my hands with love and wipe my tears, then Till this time Amma darshan
 Till the end of this mortal world, loving people turn their hands, comfort them and wipe their tears, this is Amma's wish
 " In the book The Timeless Path, Swami Ramakrishnananda Puri, a senior disciple of Amma, writes: "the recitation of Amma in mind is exactly the same as that given in our Vedas and repeated briefly in traditional religious texts after him
 Is like Bhagavad Gita
 " Amma herself says, "karma, knowledge and devotion are all three essentials
 yadi bhakthi or karm ek pakshi ke do pankh hai to gyaan uskaa ant sira he
 Only with the help of these three can the bird reach the heights
 " vah sabhi dharmon kii vibhinn prarthanaaon or aadhyatmik paripaatiyon ko mashtishk ke nirmaleekaran ke ekmaatr uddeshy ke liye vividh paddatiyon ke rup main dekhati hai
 Along with this, Amma also emphasizes the importance of meditation, altruism and the development of divine qualities like compassion, patience, kindness, self control, based on meditation, Karma Yoga, Amma says that practicing these qualities refines our brain, This makes it capable of assimilating the ultimate truth: the ultimate truth is that our existence is not confined within the confines of this body and brain but it is a blissful consciousness that It acts as the Advaita substratum of the universe
 is vichaar ko hi ammaa jeevanmukti kahati hai
 Amma says, "jeevan Mukti is not a state to be attained after death and you will not experience or attain it in any other world
 It is a state of complete consciousness and samvadhi which is experienced by this living body The same can be done in this world right now
 apane swa ke saath ekikrut hokar is ucchtam satya kaa anubhav karne ke baad, aisi aanandamay aatm ko punah janm lene kii aavashyaktaa nahi hoti

 " ammaa ke vishwavyaapee dharmarth mishan main beghar logon ke liye 100,000 ghar, 3 anaath ashram banane kaa kaarykram or 2004 main bhartiya sagar main tsunami jaisi aapadaaon se saamana hone kii avasthaa main raahat-or-punarvaas, muft chikitsakeey dekhbhaal, vidhwaaon or asamarth vyaktiyon ke liye pension, paryaavarniya suraksha samooh, malin bastiyon kaa navinikaran, vridhon ke liye dekhbhaal centre or garibon ke liye muft vastra or bhojan aadi kaarykram sammilit hai
 These projects are run by many organizations including Mata Amritanandamayi Math, Mata Amritanandamayi Center, amma-europe, amma-japan, amma-kenya, amma-australia etc
 yah sabhi sanghathan sanyukt rup se ambracing da world ke rup main jane jate hai
 When asked in 2004 how the development of his charitable mission was going, Amma said, "as far as activities are concerned, it is not based on any plan
 sab kuch sahaj rup se hota he
 Seeing the plight of poor and distressed people, one task became the medium of another
 Amma meets every person, she sees their problems directly and tries to overcome their sufferings
 lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu, yah sanathan dharman ke pramukh mantron main se ek he, jiskaa arth hota he, 'is sansar ke sabhi praani prasann or shantipurna rahen
' is mantra kii bhaavana ko hi karm kaa madhyam banaaya gaya he
 " adhikansh kaary swayamsevakon dwaara aadhyatmik abhyaas ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 "it is Amma's wish that all her children dedicate their lives to the spread of love and peace in this world
 Amma says" True compassion for the poor and the afflicted is true love and devotion to God
 " "mere bachche unhen bhojan karaate hai jo bhukhe hai, garibon kii sahaayta karte hai, dukhi logon ko santvanaa dete hai, peediton ko raahat pahunchaate hai or sabhi ke prati daansheel hai
 " ammaa apane bhakthi sangeet ke liye bhi bahut prasiddh hai
 More than 100 recordings of the hymns sung by him are available in more than 20 languages
 unhone dariinon bhajanon kii rachana kii he or unhen paaramparik raagon ke anusaar dhaala he
 Regarding singing of devotional songs as a spiritual practice, Amma says, "if the hymns are taken with concentration, it is beneficial to the singer, listener and nature
" baad main jab shrota bhajan par vichaar karte hai to ve bhajanon main uccharit paathon ke anuroop rahane kaa prayaas karte hai
 "amma says that in today's world, it often becomes difficult for people to concentrate during meditation, but this concentration can be easily achieved through devotional singing
 ammaa ke shishyon ne bhakton or aadhyatmik anveshankartaaon ke saath unke sanvaadon ko lipibaddh karke unki shikshaaon kii lagbhag ek darjan pustakon kaa nirmaan kiya he
 The speeches he has given at various international gatherings have also been published in book form

 Swami Amritaswarupanand Puri, vice-president of Mata Amritanandamayi Math, has also written a biography of Amma
 mata amritanandmayi math, matruvani or ek chaturmasik patrika emortal bliss kaa bhi prakaashan karata he, joki ek aadhyatmik patrika he
 Leaders shri pattathanam, jo indian reshnlist esoshiyeshan ke adhyaksh hai or kerala main rahete hai, ne math amritanandmayi: secred stories and riyalitys naamak ek vivaadit aalochanatmak pustak likhi he jo pehali baar 1985 main prakashit hui thi
 He has claimed that all the miracles performed by Sudhamani are false and there have been many suspicious deaths in and around his ashram, which need to be investigated by the police

 At that time Amritanandamayi was no more famous, later on increasing fame, the monastery sought the author's authorization of this book and in 2004 pressured the government to take action in this regard

 During this period, social reformers, writers and artists challenged the established traditions related to women, marriage, dowry, caste system and religion
 bengal ke is ghatnakram ne samgr bhartiya aadhuniktaa kii nirmitiyon par amit chhap chodi
 It was during this renaissance that structures of the earliest forms of Indian nationalism emerged
 bengal ke navajagaran kaa vistaar raja rammohan raay se armbh hokar rabindranath thakur tak mana jaataa he
 Historian Sushobhan Sarkar, who conducted a systematic study of this period, writes, 'english rule, capitalist economy and modern western culture had its first impact on Bengal, which led to a renaissance which is commonly known as the Renaissance of Bengal
 kareeb ek sadi tak badalati hui aadhunik duniya ke prati bengal kii sachet jaagrukta shesh bharat ke mukaable aage rahi
 In this context, it can be said that the role played by Bengal in the modern awakening of India can be compared to the role of Italy in the context of European Renaissance
 ’ italvi rinesaan kii hi tarah bengal kaa navajagaran koi janandolan nahin tha
 Its process and spread was limited to Bhadralok
 bhadralok main bhi navajagaran kaa prabhaav adhiktar uske hindu hisse par hi padaa
 Some Muslim personalities also emerged during this period, but the renaissance of Bengal can be partly called the Muslim Renaissance
 mote taur par mana jaataa he ki bengal ke navajagaran kii shuruyaat rammohan raay se hui or rabindranath thakur ke saath uskaa samaapan ho gaya
 The Sushobhan government has tried to divide it into five stages: the first period 1814 to 1833, whose central figure was Raja Rammohan Roy
 1814 main ve kolkata rahane ke liye aaye or 1833 main unka landan main dehanth hua
 The second period goes from his death to the Revolt of 1857
 teesri avadhi 1885 main bhartiya rashtriya congress kii sthapana tak faili hui he
 The fourth period dates back to the partition of Bengal in 1905 and the fifth period from the Swadeshi movement to the non-cooperation movement and the beginning of Mahatma Gandhi's leadership i

 rammohan raay ke bare main ek drushtaant he jise unki shakhsiyat ke roopak kii tarah padhaa ja saktaa he
 He is said to have had two houses
 khan-paan, veshbhusha or rahan-sahan ke lihaaz se ek main kisi victorian jentilmen kii bhanti rahete the or duusare main parmparik bengali brahman kii tarah
 Indeed, the greatest feature of his personality and work was the synthesis of East and West
 lekin, yah drushtaant bhi unke roodhibhanjak vyaktitv ko paribhaashit nahin karata
 In 1820, his work 'percepts of Jesus' was published in which the moral message of Jesus was separated from Christian philosophy and miracle tales
 bengal main sakriy isai padri varg unki is koshish se naaraaz ho gaya
 As a result of his opposition, Rammohun Roy gave more clarity to his views by issuing three appeals to the Christian public
 isi ke saath unhone brahmanical megazin kaa prakaashan karke hindu aastikta ke vaicharik nairantary ko vedon ke hawaale se rekhaankit karne kii cheshtaa bhi kii
 On 20 August 1828, Rammohan formed the 'brahma Sabha' to bring his religious ideas to earth
 is prakriya kaa parinaam 1830 main ek carch kii sthapana ke rup main niklaa or brahm samaaj andolan shuru hua jo lambe samay tak bengali samaaj kii chetana ko prabhavit karata rahaa
 Between 1818 and 1829, Rammohun Roy published three compositions attacking the evil like the practice of sati
 sati pratha ke kilaaf janamat banane or angrezon ko us par pratibandh lagane ke liye manaane kaa shrey unke prayaason ko hi diya jaataa he
 Rammohan played a pioneering role in the spread of modern education and especially female education
 unhen bangla gadhy kaa nirmaataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Rammohan's efforts faced double opposition in this phase of Bengal Renaissance
 ek taraf unka virodh radhakant deb, gaurikant bhattacharya or bhavani charan banerjee jaise sudhaar virdohi paramparanishth lekhak or vidwaan kar rahe the, vahiin unhen francisi kranti or inglish radicalizam se anupranit aalochana kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa jiskaa netritv ‘yang bengal’ or uske anglo-indine netaa henry vivian derozio ke haathon main tha
 It is a different matter that Derozio's followers were not able to make any lasting impact other than shocking the society with their works and oratory
 lekin, rammohan kii parampara ke aadhaar par samaaj sudhaaron kaa naram kaarykram unki mrityu ke baad bhi jari rahaa
 He was commanded by Devendranath Thakur and Akshay Kumar Dutt

 1857 ke vidroh ke baad bengal ke punarjagran ne saahitiyik kranti or uske zariye rashtravaadi chintan ke yug main pravesh kiya
 Bengali intellectuals also joined their voices in the struggle of the peasants against the British oppression of indigo

 1873 main vishabruksh ke zariye unhone saamaajik upanyaason kii parampara kaa sutarapaat kiya
 By writing an essay titled 'samya' in 1879, Bankim showed a tendency towards egalitarianism and utopian socialism, but by writing Anandamath in 1882, he was swept away by a wave of patriotic revivalism
 isi rachana main darj ‘vandemataram’ geet bharat ke teen raashtragiton main se ek he
 Along with literary innovation, the Bengali Renaissance also heralded the tradition of contribution to historiography and other fields of sociology
 dharmik sudhaaron or punarutthanavaad ke lihaaz se bhi yah daur khaasaa ghatnaprad tha
 On the one hand, under the leadership of Keshav Chandra Sen, the young Brahm was awakening in the Samaj reform movement, on the other hand, the Wahhabi dissent was seething and the footsteps of neo-hinduism were being heard
 isi avadhi main dakshineshwar ke sant ramakrishna paramhans ne apane chumbakeey vyaktitv ke madhyam se sabhi dharmik aasthaaon ko pavitra ghoshit kiya
 Protestant extremism that fueled Christian conversion weakened it and gave little relief to the advocates of the tradition

 In 1897, when he returned after touring the West for four years, he was welcomed as a national hero
 1861 ke baad kii avadhi to kuch is tarah kii thi jisamen bengali buddhijivi samaaj kaa sabase priy shabd ‘rashtriya’ ban gaya
 a variety of activities were led by Rajnarayan Bose, Navagopal Mitra, Jyotirindranath Thakur and Bhudev Mukherjee, notable for organizing the Hindu fair which has been critical of Kolkata for nearly ten years
 1870 ke baad kii avadhi raajnneetik andolanon kii avadhi thi jisamen surendranath banerjee kaa netritv ubhara jinhen ‘bengal ke betaj ke badshaah’ ke taur par janaa gaya
 Due to the militant cause of Surendranath, the British spoiled his name and also called 'surrender not' Banerjee
 1876 main banerjee ne ‘indine association’ kii sthapana kii jiske 1883 ke rashtriya sammelan main sabhi bharatiyon ke liye ek rashtriya sanghathan banane kaa vichaar paidaa hua
 This resulted in the historic founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885
 bengali buddhijiviyon congress kii gatividhiyon main jam kar bhagidaari kii or 1903 tak congress adhiveshnon kii adhyakshata saat baar unke khate main gayi
 Bengal, along with Maharashtra and Punjab, played a decisive role in the creation of the Congress faction

 However, all these talents faded in front of Rabindranath Tagore's talent

 hadi rani salumbar ke sardaar raav ratan singh choonaavat kii patni thi
 The wedding took place only a week
 na haathon kii mehandi chhuti thi or na hi pairon kaa aalata
 It was morning
 haada sardaar gahari neend main the
 The queen came back to wake up the king
 unki aakhon main neend kii khumaari saaf jhalak rahi thi
 The queen laughably tried to awaken them
 is bich darban aakar vahaan khadaa ho gaya
 On not paying attention to the king, the queen said, Maharana's messenger has been standing for quite a while
 vah thakur se turant milanaa chaahate hai
 You have to bring any necessary letter, it is necessary to give it now
 asamay main doot ke aagaman kaa samachar
 Thakur was shocked
 ve sochane lage ki avashya koi vishesh baat hogi
 Rana knows that he has just returned after getting married
 apaat kii ghadi hi ho sakati he
 He told the Hari Rani to go to his room, bring the messenger immediately and sit
 main nityakarm se sheeghra hi nipatakar aata hum, haada sardaar ne darban se kaha
 The Sardar retired in a hurry and came out
 sahasaa baithak main baithe rana ke doot par uski nigaah ja padi
 After the formalization, Thakur said to the messenger, "hey Shardul Tu"
 itani subah kaise? kya bhabhi ne ghar se khaded diya he? sara majaa phir kirkira kar diya
 The Sardar again said to the messenger, your new sister must have gone inside, angry at you
 nai nai he na
 Therefore the poor thing did not say anything
 aisi kya afat aa padi thi
 For two days, he used to allow peace
 miyaan bivi ke bich main kyon kebab main haddi banakar aa baithe
 Say good why has Rana missed me? He laughed hoarsely
 donon main gahari dosti thi
 If there were normal days, he would have responded in laughter too
 shardool khud bhi bada hansod tha
 He could not live for a single moment without laughing at the joke, but he was very serious
 dost hansi chodo
 The moment of great crisis has come
 mujhe bhi turant waapas lautnaa he
 Suddenly he became silent after saying this
 apane is mitra ke vivaah main baaraati banakar gaya tha
 Looking at the lines of seriousness on his face, the mind of the Handa Sardar became apprehensive
 sachmuch kuch anhoni to nahin ho gayin he
 The messenger was hesitant whether to give Rana's letter to a friend at this time
 haada sardaar ko turant yuddh ke liye prasthaan karne kaa nirdesh lekar vah laayaa tha
 He remembered the friend's words
 haada ke pairon ke nakhunon main lage mahavar kii laali ke nishaan abhi bhi vaise ke vaise hi ubhare hue the
 Even the rosemary in the hands of the newly married handi queen will not be dry
 pati patni ne ek duusare ko thik se dekha pahachaanaa nahin hoga
 How painful will their separation be? He trembled as soon as he remembered this
 pataa nahin yuddh main kya ho? vaise to rajput mrityu ko khilonaa hi samajhataa hai
 Finally, after hardening, he put the letter of Rana Raj Singh in the hands of Hada Sardar
 rana kaa uske liye sandesh tha
 Veerwar
 avilamb apni sainya tukdi ko lekar aurangzeb kii sena ko roko
 The Muslim army is advancing its aid
 is samay aurangzeb ko main ghere hue hum
 His help is to keep the growing army entangled for some time so that it does not move soon, till then i finish the whole work
 tum is kaary ko badi kushalta se kar sakate ho
 Although it is very dangerous
 jaan kii baaji bhi lagaani pad sakati he
 i trust you
 haada sardaar ke liye yah pariksha kii ghadi thi
 On one hand, the vast Mughal army and its troops are very small
 rana rajsingh ne mewar ke chhine hue kshetron ko mughalon ke changul se mukt kara liya tha
 Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan had put the strength of his AD peak
 vah chup hokar baith gaya tha
 Now the reins of governance came in the hands of Aurangzeb
 rana se charumati ke vivaah ne uski dwesh bhaavana ko or bhi bhadkaa diya tha
 In the meantime, another thing had happened which brought Raj Singh and Aurangzeb face to face
 yah sampurna hindu jati kaa apmaan tha
 Accept Islam or punish you for being a Hindu
 yahi kah kar hinduon par usne jajia kar lagaaya tha
 Rana Raj Singh opposed it
 unka man bhi ise sahan nahin kar rahaa tha
 As a result, many other Hindu kings refused to implement it
 unka saahas bad gaya tha
 The fire that broke the chains of slavery, which had slowed down, was ignited again
 dakshin main shivaji, bundelkhand main chhatrasaal, punjab main guru govind singh, marwar main rathod vir durgadas mughal sultanate ke viruddh uth khadey hue the
 Even Mirza Raja Jai singh of Amer and Jaswant Singh of Marwar which were the two major pillars of the Mughal Sultanate
 unamem bhi swatantraaa premiyon ke prati sahanubhuti utpann ho gai thi
 The Mughal emperor attacked Mewar with a large army
 rana rajsingh ne sena ke teen bhaag kiye the
 The Mughal army had entrusted the responsibility of not allowing Aravali to enter its son Jaisingh
 ajmer kii ore se badshaah ko milane vaali sahaayta ko rokane kaa kaam duusare bete bhim singh kaa tha
 He himself, along with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore, broke out on Aurangzeb's army
 sabhi morchon par unhen vijay praapt hui thi
 Emperor Aurangzeb's great beloved Caucasian Begum was taken captive
 badi kathinaayee se kisi prakaar aurangzeb praan bachaakar nikal sakaa tha
 Such was the victory of Maharana of Mewar that Aurangzeb could never raise his head against him again in his lifetime
 lekin kya is vijay kaa shrey keval rana ko tha yaa kisi or ko? haada rani or haada sardaar ko kisi bhi prakaar se gam nahin tha
 When the Mughal emperor was surrounded by Rajputs all around
 uski jaan ke bhi laale pade the
 It was difficult for him to escape, when he called an additional army to help him from Delhi
 rana ko yah pehle hi gyaat ho chukaa tha
 He wrote a letter to Hada Sardar to block the passage of the Mughal army
 vahi sandesh lekar shardool singh mitra ke paas pahunchaa tha
 Not delaying even a single moment, Hada Sardar ordered his troops to march
 ab vah patni se antim vidaai lene ke liye uske paas pahunchaa tha
 Hadi Rani was shocked to see her husband dressed in saffron garb
 kahaan chale swami? itani jaldi
 Just now you were saying that the war has been spent for four to six months, what will it cut comfortably? Shocked in mixed words, the queen spoke to her husband
 priy
 The Kshatriyans wait for this day to test their husband's bravery and might
 vah shubh ghadi abhi hi aa gai
 We have got the opportunity to have two hands from the enemies of the country
 mujhe yahaan se avilamb nikalnaa he
 Say goodbye pataa nahin phir kabhi bhent ho yaa na ho haada sardaar ne muskaraa kar patni se kaha
 Hadra Sardar's mind was apprehensive
 sachmuch hi yadi na lautaa to
 What will happen to my half-heartedness? On one side was duty and on the other side was the attachment of wife
 isi antardvand main uskaa man fansaa tha
 He told the whole thing in detail regarding Rana Raj Singh's letter to his wife
 vidaai maangate samay pati kaa galaa bhar aayaa he yah hadi raji kii tej ankhon se chipa na rah sakaa
 Although the Harada chieftain tried to hide him completely
 hataash man vyakti ko vijay se dur le jaataa he
 It did not take long for that brave lady to understand that her husband was going to the battlefield but was enchanted
 pati vijayshri praapt karen iske liye usne kartavya kii vedi par apane moh kii bali de di
 She said to her husband, please be a lord
 main abhi ai
 She ran in and out
 aarti kaa thaal sajaayaa
 Inoculated her husband's head, performed her arti
 vah pati se boli
 i was blessed to find such a brave husband
 hamaara aapkaa to janm janmaantar kaa saath he
 Rajput Ramnis give birth to a son for this day only you go master
 main vijay maala liye dwaar par aapaki pratiksha karuungi
 He drank the tears rising in his eyes
 pati ko durbal nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 While walking, my husband said to her dear
 main tumko koi sukh na de sakaa, bas iskaa hi dukh he mujhe bhul to nahin jaaogi ? yadi main na rahaa to xxrep 13 
 Her sentences could not even be fulfilled that the Handi Rani placed a palm on her face
 na na swami
 Do not say such inauspicious things
 main vir rajputani hum, phir vir kii patni bhi hum
 Knowing your last religion very well, you definitely leave
 desh ke shatruon ke daant khattey karen
 This is my prayer
 haada sardaar ne ghode ko aid lagaayi
 The queen kept staring at him until he disappeared from his eyes
 uske man main durbalata kaa jo tufaan chipa tha jise abhi tak usne barabas roak rakhaa tha vah ankhon se bah niklaa
 The Harada Sardar was being blown up in the air with his army
 kintu uske man main rah rah kar aa rahaa tha ki kahi sachmuch meri patni mujhe bisar na den? vah man ko samajhaata par usak dhyaan udhar hi chalaa jaataa
 In the end, he could not stop it
 usne aadhe maarg se apane vishwast sainikon ke rani ke paas bheja
 He reminded me again, don't forget me
 main jarur lautoonga
 The queen returned after reassuring the communicator
 doosar din ek or vaahak aayaa
 Then the same thing
 tisare din phir ek aayaa
 This time he had brought the letter of Sardar to his wife
 priy main yahaan shatruon se loha le rahaa hum
 His feet have been stopped like Angad
 majaal he ki ve jaraa bhi aage bad jaaen
 This is the glory of your defense
 par tumhaare badi yaad aa rahi he
 The letter carrier must send someone their favorite sign
 use hi dekhakar main man ko halkaa kar liya karunga
 Hari Rani got into thinking after reading the letter
 yuddhrat pati kaa man yadi meri yaad main hi rama rahaa unke netron ke saamne yadi meraa hi mukhdaa ghumta rahaa to vah shatruon se kaise ladenge
 How will you describe Vijay Shri? a thought flashed in his mind
 vah sainik se boli vir ? main tumhen apni antim nishaan de rahi hum
 Take it and give it to them
 thaal main sajaakar sundar vastra se dhakkar apane vir senapati ke paas pahunchaa dena
 But no one else sees it
 ve hi khol kar dekhen
 Also give this letter of mine together
 hadi rani ke patr main likhaa tha priy
 i am sending you my last sign
 tumhaare moh ke sabhi bandhanon ko kaat rahi hum
 Now be careful and do your duty
 i left


 i will wait for you in heaven
 palak jhapakate hi hadi rani ne apane qamar se talwaar nikaal, ek jatke main apane sir ko uda diya
 He rolled on the earth
 sipaahi ke netro se ashrudhara bah nikali
 Duty of duty is harsh
 The soldier decorated the severed head of the handi queen in a golden platter

 jataka yaa jataka pali yaa jataka kathaayen buddha granth tripitak kaa suttapitak antargat khuddakanikaay kaa 10waan bhaag he
 These stories contain the stories of Mahatma Buddha's earlier births

 The oldest written stories in the world are Jataka tales in which about 600 stories have been collected
 yah isvi samvath se 300 varsh purv kii ghatana he
 These stories attempt to explain policy and religion through entertainment
 jataka khuddak nikaay kaa dasavaan prasiddh granth he
 It would be more appropriate to call Jataka as the book of texts rather than as a text
 uskaa koi-koi kathanak puure granth ke rup main he or kahin-kahin uski kahaniyon kaa rup sankshipt mahakavy-sa he
 The word Jataka is made of mass metal
 iskaa arth he bhoot athwa bhav
 This word is formed by adding the suffix 'kat' to the 'jan' metal
 dhaatu ko bhoot arth main prayukt karte hue jab arth kiya jaataa he to jatbhoot katha evam rup banataa he
 jat-jani-janan-janam meaning is used when used in the Bhava sense
 is tarah ‘jataka’ shabd kaa a rth he, ‘jaat’ arthath janm-sambandhin
 'jataka' is the stories related to the pre-birth of Lord Buddha
 buddhatv praapt kar lene kii avasthaa se purv bhagavan buddha bodhisattva kehalaate hai
 They are candidates for enlightenment at that time and practice the ten perfections or perfections of charity, piety, friendship, truth, etc
 bhoot-dayaa ke liye ve apane praanon kaa anek baar balidaan karte hai
 In this way, they perform the ability of intelligence
 bodhisattva shabd kaa arth hi he bodhi ke liye udyogshil praani
 For Bodhi, Sattva, which is also said by some scholars
 pali sutton main ham anek baar padhate hai, ‘‘sambodhi praapt hone se pehle, buddha na hone ke samay, jab main bodhisattva hi tha‘‘ aadi
 Therefore, the bodhisattva clearly means the seeker practicing knowledge, true mercy etc
 who is sure to become Buddha later
 bhagwaan buddha bhi na keval apane antim janm main buddhatv-prapti kii avasthaa se purv bodhisattva rahe the, balki apane anek purv janmon main bhi bodhisattva kii charya kaa unhone paalan kiya tha
 The stories of the Jataka are related to these various previous births of Lord Buddha while he was a Bodhisattva
 adhiktar kahaniyon main ve pradhan paatr ke rup main chitrit he
 He himself is the protagonist of the story
 kahin-kahin unka sthaan ek saadhaaran paatr ke rup main gaun he or kahin-kahin ve ek darshak ke rup main bhi chitrit kiye gayi hai
 Often the beginning of each story goes like this: "once upon a time when King Brahmadatta ruled in Varanasi, the Bodhisattvas originated from the vagina of the Kurang deer or 


 the clans of the horses of the Indus cross or the xxrep 5 
 Bodhisattva Brahmadatta's amatya or 

 Bodhisattva was born in the vagina of Goh, etc
 jataka kii kahaniyon main se kuch kaa namakaran to jataka main ai hui gaatha ke pehle shabdon se hua he, yatha-apashnak jataka; kisi kaa pradhan paatr ke anusaar, yatha vannupath jataka; kisi kaa un janmon ke anusaar jo bodhisattva ne grahan kiye yatha, nigredh mig jataka, machh jataka, aadi
 All Jataka stories have been told by Gautam Buddha, Jataka Buddha is time-bound, it is very difficult to decide what is the exact number of people
 lanka, burma or siam main prachlit parampara ke anusaar jataka 550 hai
 Samanatpasadika's Nidan Katha also mentions the same number of natives
 ‘‘pannasa dhakani panchastani jatkanti veditbban
 "in the diagnosis story of Atthasalini also - Pannasadhikani Panchajatakasatani"
 sankhya mote taur par hi nishchit kii gai he
 In the present form of Jataka there are 547 Jataka stories
 par yah sankhya bhi keval upree he
 The Jatakattavanakarika has divided them into five sections in terms of content - jataka kii kai kahaniyaan alp roopaantar ke saath do jagah bhi pai jaati he yaa ek duusare main samavisht bhi kar di gai hai, or isi prakaar kai jataka kathaayen sutt-pitak, vinay-pitak, tathaa anya pali granthon main to pai jaati he, kintu jataka ke vartmaan rup main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, there is also a possibility of a significant decrease in the number of natives and an increase
 udhaahrantah munik jataka or saluk jataka kii kathavstu ek hi si he, kintu keval bhinn-bhinn naamon se vah do jagah ai he
 In contrast, there are two different names, named 'munik Jataka'
 yahi baat machh jataka naam se do jataka kii bhi he
 Somewhere, two independent Jatakas have been merged and a third Jatak has been created
 udhaaharan ke liye panchapandit jataka or dakarkkhas jataka ye donon jataka mahoumagg jataka main antarbhavit hai
 The stories which are found elsewhere in the form of jataka-katha, but are not stored in 'jataka', it will also be necessary to mention something
 majjhim nikaay kaa ghatikaar- sutt yaa ghatikaar sutt ek aisi hi jataka kahani he, jo ‘jataka’ main nahin milti
 Similarly, the Mahagovind Sutta of longevity which has been specified by the name of 'mahagovind Jataka' in the Jataka story of the Jataka itself, is not found inside the Jataka
 isi prakaar dhammapadatthkatha or milind panh main bhi kuch aisi jataka-kathaayen uddhrut kii gai hai, jo jataka main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, some people definitely cannot decide exactly how many are there
 jab jaatakon kii sankhya ke sambandh main vichaar karte hai to jataka se hamaara taatpary ek vishesh sheershak vaali kahani se hota he, jisamen bodhisattva ke jivan-sambandhi ki si ghatana kaa varnan ho, phir chaahe us ek jataka main kitni hi avaantar kathaayen kyon na goonth di gai hon
 If the total stories are counted then about three thousand stories are found in the native
 vastav main jaatakon kaa sankalan sutt-pitak or vinay-pitak ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 There are many such stories in Sutta-pitaka which have been used to preach there
 kintu bodhisattva kaa ullekh usamen nahin he
 After doing this work, each story has been given the form of a Jataka
 titir jataka or dighit kosal jataka kaa nimarn isi prakaar vinay-pitak ke kramshah chullavagg or mahavagg se kiya gaya he
 Manikanth Jataka is also based on vinaya-pitaka
 isi prakaar deergh-nikaay ke kootadant sutt or mahasudassan sutt tathaa majjhim nikaay ke makhadev sutt bhi puure arthon main jataka hai
 At least 13 Jataka people have been discovered by scholars in Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 yadhyapi rajktha chor-katha evam isi prakaar kii bhay, yuddh, gram, nigam, nagar, janapad, stri, panghat, bhoot-pret aadi sambandhi kathaon ko tirashchin kathaayen kahkar bhikshu sangh main heyata kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha
 Nevertheless, monks used to use stories in some quantity for preaching
 swayan bhagwaan ne bhi upamaaon or drushtaanton ke dwaara dharm kaa upadesh diya he
 In the second variation of the Buddhist Sanskrit text Siddharmapundarika Sutra it is also said that the Buddha teaches with many parables and through the Jataka for the welfare of all beings
 buddha ke alaava anya bhartiya sant bhi upanishdon ke kaal se lekar ramakrishna paramhans ke samay tak aakhyayikaon or drushtaanton ke sahare dharmopadesh karte rahe hai
 The Jataka tales have developed on the basis of this trend
 jan samaaj main prachlit kathaon ko bhi kahi-kahin le liya gaya he, kintu unhen ek nayaa naitik rup de diya gaya he, jo buddha dharm kii ek visheshta he
 Hence Buddhism has its full imprint on all Jataka tales
 purv parampara se chale aate hue lok-aakhyaanon kaa aadhaar unamem ho saktaa he, par unka sampoorn dhaanchaa buddha dharm ke naitik adarsh ke anukool he
 The Buddha Vedas have been classified as nine organs, whose names are- buddha vachanon kaa yah nau prakaar kaa vibhaajan unke style swaroopon yaa namoonon kii drushti se hi he, granthon kii drushti se nahin
 There were so many types of Buddha sermons, this is the meaning of this classification
 buddha vachanon kaa nau angon main vibhaajan jinamein jataka kii sankhya saatvin he, atyant pracheen he
 Hence, Jataka stories are important and necessary parts of Pali literature in Sarvansh
 unki sankhya ke vishay main anischitata visheshtah unke samay-samay par sutt pitak or vinay-pitak tathaa anya shroton se sankalan ke kaaran or swayan pali pitak ke naanaa vargikarnon or unke paraspar sanmishran ke kaaran utpann hui he
 In Chulla Niddes, we find only 500 Jatakas
 chini yatri phahyan ne paanchavi shatabdi isvi main 500 jaatakon ke chitra lanka main ankit hue dekhe the
 Pictures of the natives have been found in the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi before the second third century BC
 jinamein se kam se kam 27 yaa 29 jaatakon ke chitron kii pahchaan rais davids ne kii thi
 Since then some other Jataka stories have also been identified on the stone-vesantis of these stupas
 ye sab tathy jataka kii pracheenta or uske vikaas ke suchak hai
 Jataka tales are also found in texts of Sanskrit Buddhism, like Stalistic Pali literature
 pali ke nawang buddha vachan kii tarah yahan dwaad sha ang dharmapravachan maane gayi hai
 In both of these places the Jataka exists as an organ or part of the discourse
 buddha sanskrit granth jatakamala main jo aryashur kii rachana bataai jaati he 34 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Aryasur is called Lama and Taranath is another name for Ashwaghosh but it does not seem to be right
 sambhavtah ve chaturth shatabdi isvi ke kavi the
 About 80 Jataka tales are found in the famous epic book Mahavastu written between 200 BCE and 400 BCE
 isamen se kuch pali jataka ke samaan hai or ku chha aisi bhi hai, jo pali jataka main nahin pai jaati
 Raees Davids states that the collection and execution of the Jataka took place on the basis of ancient folklore in the middle country
 vinternitj ne bhi praayah isi mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 Most of the people are Buddhakalins
 sanchi or bharhut ke s tupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par unke drishyon kaa ankit hona unke purv ashokakaleen hone kaa paryaapt sakshya detaa he
 In relation to the time and curiosity of the person, more light will come from discussing his literary form and characteristics
 prayek jataka katha paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Panchuppannavatthu means the present-day event or story
 buddha ke jivan kaal main jo ghatana ghati vah pacchuppannavatthu he
 That incident gave God the opportunity to say the story of a previous birth
 yah purvajanm kaa vrutt hi atitvatthu he
 The most important part of the story of each person is the past
 isi ke anukool pacchppannavatthu kahin-kahin garh lee gai prathit hoti he
 The past is followed by one or more verses
 inkaa sambandh vaise to atitvatthu se hi hota he, kintu kahin-kahin pacchppannavatthu se bhi hota he
 Gathas are the oldest parts of the native
 vastav main gaathaayen hi jataka hai
 The Jataka, who is composed of five parts, such as Pachchuppannavathu, is actually Jatakattavavana or Jataka comes to Vyayakaran or Athavana
 isamen gaathaon kii vyakhya or unka shabdaarth hota he
 At the last comes a solstice, in which the characters of the past is linked with the characters of the Buddha's life time, as at that time the hunter who hunted from the attic was the present-day Dev Dutt and the Kurung deer was me, etc
 
 jataka main buddha ke purv janmon kii kathaayen sangruhit he jabaki unhone bodhisattva ke rup main vibhinn parmitaayen puri kin or buddhatv ke liye yogyata sampadit kii
 In the first four bodies of the sutta-pitaka, the historical form of the Buddha is reputed
 baad main jataka main unke aitihaasik jivan ko purv kii kathaon se sambaddh kar diya pate hai
 Jatakathakatha's Nidan Katha tells about three Nidas of Buddha life, Dure Nidan is the story of Buddha life from very distant past, it is believed that Buddha Sumedha was born as an ascetic in a very remote past
 us samay unhone deepankar buddha main badi nishtha dikhaai jiske parinamswaroop unhone unhen aage chalakar buddha hone kaa aashirwad diya
 The cultivation of the sume and ascetic continued while holding various bodies for many births
 ant main vessantar raja ke rup main sharir tyaag kar ve tushit lok main gayi
 From the form of Sumedha ascetic to the passage to the well-to-do, this cult of Buddha is under distant diagnosis
 547 jataka kathaayen apannak jataka se lekar vessantar jataka tak buddha jeevani ke is duure nidaan se hi sambandhit he
 These stories here mean the past story mentioned in them
 inkaa sambandh buddha kii jivan-katha ke duure nidaan se he arthath ye bahut dur ateet kii kathaayen hai
 From the time of being born in Lumbini forest to the attainment of Bodhi, the story is related to the unhealthy diagnosis
 arthath vah itane dur ateet kii nahin he
 From the attainment of Bodhi to attainment of Nirvana, the Buddha biography is under the diagnosis of Santi
 arthath vah sameep kii he
 Some parts of it come in the form of preface in Jataka's Pachuppannavatthu
 jataka kii kahaniyon main atitvatth main buddha jeevani ke duure nidaan ke andar samavisht unke purv janmon kii kahaniyaan aati he
 a holiday has been taken to tell the stories of these two nidanas by mentioning an event in the life of the historical Buddha
 jo ho vastav main jataka kaa nirmaan karti he
 It is clear from the above discussion of the five parts of each Jataka that the Jataka are prose-verse mixed compositions
 gaatha bhaag jataka kaa pracheenatam bhaag mana jaataa he
 It would be more appropriate to consider this saga part under Tripitaka
 shesh sab atthkatha he
 But the nature of the Jataka tales is such that nothing can be understood by separating the original from the interpretation
 keval gaathaayen kahani kaa nirmaan nahin karti
 When the events of the present and past are put on them, only the plot is created
 atah puure jataka main uparyukt paanch avyavon kaa haana aavashyak he jisamen gaatha-bhaag ko chhodkar shesh sab uski vyakhya he baad kaa joda hua he
 Yet for convenience and historically wrongly, we call it Jataka
 vastav main 547 jataka kathaon ke sangrah ko jo uparyukt paanch angon se samanvit he, hamen jataka na kahkar jatakatthawannana yaa jatakatthakatha hi kahana chahie
 Fosbal and Koval, which have been edited and translated in Roman script and in English respectively, or Bhadant Anand Kausalayan in Hindi, have been translated into 6 parts under the title 'jataka', that is actually the interpretation of Jataka rather than Jataka
 jataka kathaayen to mul rup main keval gaathaayen he, shesh bhaag uski vyakhya he
 The question arises as to what is the relationship between the saga and the remaining part of the native in terms of chronology etc
 atathkatha main gaatha-bhaag ko abhisambuddha gaatha yaa bhagavan buddha dwaara bhashit gaathaayen kaha gaya he
 They are Buddhist
 atah ve tipitak ke angabhoot thi or unakon vahaan se sankalit kar unke upar kathaon kaa dhaanchaa prastut kiya gaya he
 On the basis of the classification of the contents of the entire Jataka text, it is also clear that the saga-part, or what the scholars like Pinternnitz, called saga-jataka, is its base
 jataka granth kaa vargeekaran vishay-vastu ke aadhaar par na hokar gaathaon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par hua he
 Like the ther-theri saga, he is also divided into the Nittpas
 jataka main 22 nipaat hai
 There are 150 such stories in the first Nipta, in which a saga of one is found
 duusare nipaat main bhi 150 jataka kathaayen he kintu yahan prayek katha main do-do gaathaayen pai jaati hai
 Similarly, there are fifty-fifty stories in the third and fourth nipatas and the number of gathas is three-three and four-four respectively
 aage bhi terahaven nipaat tak praayah yahi kram chalata he
 The name of the fourteenth fall is Pakinak Nipat
 is nipaat main gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar vividh he
 Hence it has been named Pakinnak
 is nipaat main kuch kathaon main 10 gaathaayen bhi pai jaati he or kuch main 47 tak bhi pai jaati he
 The number of gathas has steadily increased in the future
 pandrahaven nipaat kaa sheershak he vis nipaat, solahaven kaa tins nipaat, satrahawein kaa chattalis nipaat, attharahawein kaa pannas nipaat ,unnisven kaa saththi nipaat, biswein kaa sattatinipat or ikkisven kaa asitinipat
 There are only ten Jataka tales in the bison nipat, but the number of gathas in each is above a hundred
 antik jataka main to gaathaon kii sankhya saat sau se bhi upar he
 All of this leads to the conclusion that the Jataka is the basis of stories
 swayan anek jataka kathaon ke veyyakaran bhaag main pali or atthkatha ke bich bhed dikhaaya gaya he, jaise ki pali sutton kii anya anek atthakathaon tathaa visuddhimaggon aadi granthon main bhi
 As far as the appropriation part of the native is concerned, there can be only the meaning of Pali, the last story
 bhashaa ke sakshya se bhi gaatha bhaag adhik pracheenta kaa dyotak he apekshaakrit gadhy bhaag ke
 Pinternitz has said that the entire saga of the native cannot be considered as the original part of the Tipitaka
 unamem bhi purvapar bhed he
 This is clear from the classification of the native himself
 chaudaaven nipaat main prayek jataka katha kii gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar kahi-kahin bahut adhik he
 Similarly, in the twentieth fall, the number of his two Jataka stories is 92 and 93 respectively, not seventy-seventy
 is sabase yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya he ki jataka kaa gaathaon athwa gaatha jataka kii mul sankhya nipaat ke sheershak kii sankhya ke anukool hi hogi
 And later it has been augmented
 atah kuch gaatha en adhik pracheen he or kuch apekshaakrit kam pracheen he
 Similarly, the prose section also has some very ancient features and some are relatively ancient
 kisi-kisi jataka main gadhy or gaatha bhaag main samya bhi nahin dikhaai padataa or kahi-kahin style main bhi badi vibhinnata he
 This highlights the computational form and diversity of its linguistic form, with many composers or compilers and the sum of many centuries
 jataka kii gaathaon kii pracheenta to nirvivaad he hi, uskaa adhikansh gadhy bhaag bhi atyant pracheen he
 The pictures inscribed on the stone veins of the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi are related to the prose part of the native
 atah jataka kaa adhikansh gadhy-bhaag jo pracheen he, tritiy, dwitiya shatabdi isvi purv main itnaa lokapriy to hona hin chahie ki use shilp kala kaa aadhaar banaaya ja sake
 Therefore, generally, we can consider the Jataka as a symbol of the Indian society and culture of Buddha
 usamen kuch lakshan or avasthaaon ke chithran praha-buddhakalin bharat ke bhi hai or kuch buddha ke kaal ke baad ke bhi he
 As far as the interpretation and interpretation of the saga is concerned, it is probably the oldest part of the native
 is ansh ke lekhak acharya buddha ghosh maane jate he
 According to 'gandhavans', Acharya Buddhaghosha composed 'jataktatthanna', but it is relevant

 The existence of Jataka influence has been shown in literature

 There are 27 large administrative territorial divisions of Egypt called the Muhafazah, that is, the area under the protection or supervision of a governor

 Egyptian idioms are either urban or are a mixture of urban-pastoral

 Value-added tax, or goods and services tax, is a consumption tax, at any value that is added to a product
 bikri kar ke vipareet, waite, utpaadak or antim upabhokta ke bich maarg kii sankhya ke sambandh main tatasth he; jahaan bikri kar prayek charan main kul mulya par lagaaya jaataa he, iskaa parinaam ek sopan he 
 VAT is an indirect tax, in the form that the tax is collected from someone who does not bear the full cost of the tax

 Private end consumers of products and services cannot charge VAT on purchases, but the industry purchases goods and services that they purchase to provide further supply or service, which will be sold directly or indirectly to the end user, VAT Can be charged is tarah, aapurti kii aarthik shrinkhalaa main prayek str par lagaaya gaya kul kar, mulya kaa ek nirantar ansh he jo ek vyavsaay dwaara apane utpaadon main joda jaataa he or kar sangrah kii laagat kaa adhikansh, rajya ke bajaay kaarobaar dwaara vahan kiya jaataa he
 VAT was invented because too much sales taxes and charges encouraged fraud and smuggling
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki isse madhyam vargeey or kam aay vaale gharon par asangat rup se kar kaa boj bad jaataa he
 Value added tax avoids the stale effect of sales tax by taxing the value added at every stage of production
 paaramparik bikri kar kii bajaay mulya yojit karadhaan ko duniya bhar main pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 In principle, value-added taxes apply to all commercial activities that involve the production and distribution of goods and the provision of services
 ek vyavsaay ke prayek lenden main maal main jude mulya par waite kaa moolyankan or ekathran kiya jaataa he
 Under this concept, the government is taxed on the gross margin of each transaction
 bharat jaise kai vikasshil deshon main, bikri kar / waite ek mahatvapurn rajasav strot hai chunki ucch berojgaare or nune prati vyakti aay, anya aay sroton ko aparyaapt bana detii he
 However, this is opposed by many sub-national governments as it reduces the total revenue collection they collect as well as some loss of autonomy
 bikri kar aamtaur par upabhoktaaon ko keval antim bikri par lagaae jate hai: pratipurti kii vajah se, waite kaa antim keemton par vaisaa hi samgr aarthik prabhaav padataa he
 The main difference is just the additional accounting that needs to be done by those who fall in the middle of the supply chain, not taking into account this lack of VAT, on each member of the production chain, their position in this chain of customers and customers
 Giving and eliminating attempts to check and certify their status is balanced by the use of the same tax
 jab waite pranali main kuch chhot ho to, yadi koi ho, jaisaa kii newjiland main GST ke saath, waite kaa bhugtan karnaa or bhi aasaan ho jaataa he
 a common economic consideration is that if sales tax exceeds 10%, then people become largely involved in tax evasion activities
 duusari ore, kul waite dar, abhinav sangrah pranali ke kaaran vyapak chori ke bina 10% se adhik ho sakati he
 However, because of the special arrangement of its collections, VAT quite easily becomes the target of specific frauds such as carousel fraud which can be very costly for states in terms of tax revenue reduction
 waite lagu karne ke liye maanak tarika yah siddhant he ki ek vyapaar utpaada kii keemat se purv main chukaaye gaye sabhi kar ko ghataate hue kuch pratishat kaa adhikaar rakhata he
 If the VAT rate is 10%, an orange juice manufacturer will deduct 10% of the £ 5 per gallon price from the tax previously paid by the orange farmer
 is udhaaharan main, santare kaa ras nirmaataa £0

 Each business has a strong incentive for suppliers to pay their taxes, leading to a higher VAT rate than a retail sales tax, with less tax evasion
 is saral siddhant ke peeche iske karyanvayan main bhinnataayen hai, jaisaa ki agle bhaag main charchaa kii gai he By the method of collection, VAT can be accounting based or invoice based
 sangrah kii chaalaan vidhi ke tahat, prayek vikreta apane utpaada par waite dar lagaataa he or kharidaar ko ek vishesh bijak detaa he jo lagaae gaye kar kii raashi ko ingit karata he
 Buyers who are subject to VAT on their sales use these invoices to obtain a credit towards their liability for VAT
 paarit bijak or praapt bijak par dikhaae gaye kar ke antar ko tab sarkaar ko diya jaataa he 
 In the account-based method, no such special invoice is used
 iske bajaay, kar kii gananaa yojit mulya par kii jaati he, jise rajasav or sweekaarya kharid ke bich ek antar ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 The invoice method is used in most countries today, the only exception being Japan where accounting is used
 sangrah ke samay dwaara, waite yaa to prodbhavan yaa nakad aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Cash based accounting is a very simple form of accounting
 jab vastu yaa seva kii bikri ke liye ek bhugtan praapt hota he, ek sanchay banataa he or rajasav ko nidhiyon kii prapti kii tithi main darj kiya jaataa he - isse koi fark nahin padataa ki bikri kab kii gai
 Checks are written when money is available to bill and the expense is recorded on the date of the check - regardless of when the expense was incurred
 praathmik dhyaan, bank main nakadi kii raashi par kendrit hota he or madhyamik dhyaan yah sunishchit karne main ki sabhi bilon kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya he
 There is not much effort in comparing revenue with the time period when they were earned, or in matching the expenses to the period when they were incurred
 prodbhavan aadhaarit lekhankan, rajasav kaa milan us avadhi se karata he jab unhen arjeet kiya gaya or kharchon kaa milan us avadhi se karata he jab unhen vyay kiya gaya
 Although it is more complex than cash-based accounting, it provides more information about your business
 prodbhavan aadhaar aapako, praptiyon ko trek karne main sakasham karata he or dey 
 The accrual basis helps you match revenue to the expenditure incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports
 kisi bhi vastu ke nirmaan or bikri par gaur karen, jise ham is maamle main ek vijet kahenge
 With a 10% sales tax: atah upabhokta ne shunya kar yojana kii tulana main, 10% atirikt bhugtan kiya or sarkaar ne is raashi ko ekatra kar liya
 The retailer has not lost anything directly to the tax and the retailers have to do additional paperwork so that the sales tax collected by them is properly passed on to the government
 aapurtikarta or nirmaataaon par sahi praaanpatr kii aapurti karne kaa prashasnic boj rahata he or yah jaanch karnaa ki unke graahak upabhokta nahin hai
 With 10% VAT: yani upabhokta ne shunya kar yojana kii tulana main, 10% atirikt bhugtan kiya or sarkaar ne yah rakam karadhaan main ekatra kii
 The business lost nothing directly to the tax
 unhen kharidaaron se jo antim upyogkarta nahin hai, praaanpatr ke liye anurodh kii zarurat nahin he, lekin unhen atirikt lekhankan karnaa hoga taaki ve sahi dhang se sarkaar ko, jo unhone waite se ekatrit kiya or jo unhone waite main kharch kiya ke bich ke antar ko de saken
 Note that in each case the VAT paid is equal to 10% of the profit or value added
 bikri kar vyavastha kii tulana main waite pranali kaa laabh yah he ki udyog, khapat ko, yah pramanit karte hue ki yah ek upabhokta nahin he, chipa nahin sakate 
 In the above example, we assumed that the same number of widgets were manufactured and sold before and after the introduction of the tax
 yah vaastavik jivan main sach nahin he
 The fundamentals of supply and demand suggest that any tax increases the transaction price for anyone, whether a buyer or seller
 An increase in price either shifts the demand curve left, or the supply curve shifts upward
 Both are functionally equal
 natijatan, kharide gaye saamaan kii maatra ghat jaati he or / yaa jis keemat ise bechaa jaataa he vah bad jaati he
 The above example does not include this variation of supply and demand, for simplicity and because these effects are different for each type of commodity
 uparokt udhaaharan maanata he ki kar gaiyr virupanyogy he
 Like all other taxes, a VAT, without it, deflects it
 kyonki kisi ke liye keemat bad jaati he, maal kii maatra ghat jaati he
 Accordingly, some people are made worse by more where the government gets better than tax income
 yani, aapurti or maang parivartan ke kaaran tex main hone vaale phaayde kii tulana main kahin zyada haani hoti he
 This is known as deadweight loss
 arthvyavastha dwaara kho di gai aay, sarkaar kii aay se adhik hoti he; kar aksham he
 The entire amount of government income may not be a deadweight drag, if tax revenues are used for profitable spending or have positive externality - in other words, governments can do much more than simply consume tax income
 
 jabaki virupan hote hai, waite jaise upbhog kar, aksar behatar maane jate hai kyonki ve protsaahan ko nivesh ke liye viroopit karte hai, anya prakaar ke adhikansh karadhaan kii tulana main bachat or kaary kam hota he - duusare shabdon main, ek waite utpaadan ke bajaay khapat ko hatotsahit karata he
 In the picture above, "mulya yojit kar" kii aalochana kii gai chunki iskaa boj nijee antim utpaadon ke upabhoktaaon par nirbhar karata he or isliye yah ek pratigaami kar he, haalanki yah samajhnaa chahie ki sabhi company kar ant main upabhoktaaon par ek kar ke rup main pahunchate hai
 Defendants claim that the removal of taxation through income is an arbitrary standard and that value-added tax is actually a proportional tax and that high-income people pay more at the same rate at which they consume more
 donon hi maapan, waite ko ek pragatisheel iskar banane ke bajaay adhik pratigaami banaate hai
 The effective regressive quality of a VAT system can also increase because different classes of goods are taxed at different rates
 isliye waite adhikansh rup se ek flats kar he or vyavhaar main pratigaami ho saktaa he
 Revenue from a value-added tax is often lower than expected because they are difficult and expensive to manage and collect
 kai deshon main, jahaan vyaktigat aay kar or companiyon ke laabh kar kaa sangrah aitihaasik rup se kamjor rahaa he, vahaan waite sangrah anya karon ke mukaable adhik safal rahaa he
 VAT has become more important in many jurisdictions as tariff levels have fallen worldwide due to trade liberalization and essentially VAT has replaced lost tariff revenue
 laagat or mulya yojit kar kaa virupan, aarthik aakshamataaon or pravartan muddon ke ucch aayaat shulk se kam he, yah vivaadit he, lekin siddhant ke anusaar mulya yojit kar kahin zyaada kargar hai
 VAT is more avoidable in some industries, particularly where cash transactions prevail and VAT may be criticized for promoting it
 sarkaar ke drushtikon se, tathaapi, waite, behatar ho saktaa he kyonki yah kam se kam kuch mulya yojan ko pakad saktaa he
 For example, a carpenter may provide services for cash to a homeowner who usually cannot claim an input VAT back
 isliye grihaswami ko kam laagat lagegi or badhai anya karon se batch saktaa he 
 The government will, however, still receive VAT for many other inputs that have been sold to the carpenter and the carpenter will be unable to reclaim VAT on these inputs
 jabaki, purna anupaalan karne kii tulana main kul aay kam hogi, yah anya sambhavya karadhaan pranali ke antargat aay se kam nahin hogi
 Because exports are generally zero-rated, this is often where VAT fraud occurs
 europe main, samasyaon kaa mukhya strot carozal frod kaha jaataa he
 a large quantity of valuable goods is transported from one member state to another
 in lenden ke dauraan, kuch companiyaan waite kii dendar hoti hai, dusron ko waite ko punah praapt karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 The first companies, called 'missing traders' go bankrupt without paying
 companiyon kaa doosraa samooh, sidhe rashtriya kosh se paisa 'pump' kar saktaa he
 This type of fraud originated in Benelux countries in the 1970s

 kitaab main likhaa he: "although the implementation of a broad-based federal VAT system has been regarded as the most desirable consumption tax for India since the early 1990s, such reforms will involve serious problems for the finances of regional governments

 She however lived in the house of her widowed mother Jayantibai, who then married assistant surgeon Sakharam Arjun
 jab dadaji or unke parivaar ne rukhmabai ko apane ghar jane ke liye kaha, to unhone inkaar kar diya or unke sautele-pita ne uske is nirnay kaa samarthan kiya
 This led to a long series of court cases from 1884, leading to a large public discussion on child marriage and women's rights

 sakhaaraam arjuna ne civil patron ke madhyam se jawaab diya ki vah use nahin roak rahaa tha, lekin jald hi vah bhi kanoonee sahaayta praapt karne ke liye majaboor ho gaya tha
 Through Payne, Gilbert and Sayani lawyers, Rukhmabai provided the basis for refusing to join Grandpa
