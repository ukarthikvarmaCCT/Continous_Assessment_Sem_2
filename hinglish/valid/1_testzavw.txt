 From 3 December 2004 onwards, a person born outside India will not be considered a citizen of India if their birth is not registered with the Indian Consulate within a period of one year after birth
 In certain circumstances, registration can be done after a period of 1 year with the permission of the Central Government
 ek bhartiya vaanijya duutavas main ek avyask bachche ke janm ke panjikaran ke liye aavedan dene ke saath abhibhavakon ko likhit main upkram ko yah bataanaa hota he ki is bachche ke paas kisi or desh kaa passport nahin he
 The Central Government, on application, can register a person as a citizen of India under Section 5 of the Citizenship Act 1955 if it falls under one of the following categories: - ek videshi naagarik sameekaran ke dwaara bharat kii naagarikta praapt kar saktaa he jo baarah saal se bharat main rah rahaa ho
 iske liye aavashyak he ki aavedak 7 saal kii avadhi main kul 4 saal ke liye bharat main rahaa ho or aavedan se pehle usne 12 maheene kaa samay bharat main vyateet kiya ho
 On 26 November 1949, the people domiciled in the territory of India automatically became citizens of India as per the consistent provisions of the Indian Constitution
 
bhartiya samvidhan ne pakistan ke un kshetron se aane vaale apravasiyon kii naagarikta ke sambandh main bhi praavdhaan banaaye hai, jo vibhaajan se pehle bharat kaa hissaa the
 The renunciation of citizenship is covered under section 8 of the Citizenship Act 1955
 yadi ek vayask bhartiya naagarikta ke tyaag kii ghoshnaa karata he, vah bhartiya naagarikta kho detaa he
 Also from the date of renunciation, the minor child of such person also loses Indian citizenship
 jab baccha atharah saal kii umr main pahunchataa he, use phir se bhartiya naagarikta praapt karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 The declaration of renunciation under the Indian citizenship law requires that the person making the declaration be "full of age and ability"
 naagarikta kii samaapti ko naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 9 main cover kiya gaya he
 The provisions for termination are different and differentiated from the provision for declaration of renunciation
 adhinium kii dhara 9 ke anusaar bharat kaa koi bhi naagarik jo panjikaran yaa sameekaran ke dwaara kisi or desh kii naagarikta praapt kar letaa he, uski bhartiya naagarikta radd ho jaaegi
 isamen yah bhi praavdhaan he ki bharat kaa koi bhi naagarik jo swechha se kisi duusare desh kii naagarikta praapt kar letaa he, uski bhartiya naagarikta radd ho jaayegi
vishesh rup se, samaapti kaa praavdhaan tyaag ke praavdhaan se alag he, kyonki yah "bharat ke kisi bhi naagarik " par lagu hota he or vayaskon ke liye hi pratibandhit nahin he
 That is why Indian children also automatically lose their Indian citizenship if at any time after their birth they acquire citizenship of another country, for example, by equation or registration - whether any other citizenship is acquired by the child's parents
 Why not be the result of the action of naagarikta niyam 1956 ke anusaar kisi or desh kaa passport praapt karnaa bhi us desh kii rashtriyata kaa svaichhik adhigrahan he
 According to Rule 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, "the fact that a citizen of India has obtained a passport from the government of another country on a date will be conclusive proof that he has obtained the citizenship of that country
 voluntarily Has received " ek baar phir se, yah niyam lagu hota he yadi bachche ke liye uske abhibhavakon ke dwaara videshi passport praapt kiya gaya he or chaahe is tarah ke passport ko praapt karnaa kisi anya desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar aavashyak ho, jo bachche ko apana ek naagarik maanata he 
 isse koi fark nahin padataa ki us vyakti ke paas abhi bhi bhartiya passport he
 a person who acquires another citizenship loses Indian citizenship from the same day he acquired the citizenship or passport of another country
 british rajanyik padon ke liye ek prachlit abhyaas he, udahaaran ke liye, us aavedakon se bhartiya passport ko zabt kar bhartiya praadhikaranon ko lautaa diya jaye, jo british passport ke liye aavedan karte hai, yaa jinhone ise praapt kar liya he
 There are special rules for Indian citizens regarding Goa, Daman and Diu
 naagarikta niyam, 1956 kii anusuchee ke niyam 3A ke anusaar, "ek vyakti jo naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 7 ke tahat jari, daadaraa or nagar haveli aadesh 1962, athwa goa, daman or div aadesh 1962 ke aadhaar par bhartiya naagarik ban gaya he or uske paas kisi anya desh ke dwaara jari kiya yaa passport he, tathy ki usne 19 janvari 1963 se pehle apana passport nahin lautaaya he, yah is baat kaa nirnaayak pramaan hoga ki usne is dinaank se pehle swechha se us desh kii naagarikta ko praapt kar liya he
 On 16 February 1962, the Bench of the Supreme Court of India stated in the case of Izhar Ahmed Khan v
 Union of India that "if it is found that the person has acquired foreign citizenship by equation or registration, there is no doubt that As a result of type equation or registration, he will no longer be a citizen of India
 yah bhartiya rashtriyata kaa ek rup he, jiske dharak ko bharat kaa videshi naagarik kaha jaataa he
 The Indian constitution rejects dual citizenship or dual nationality, exceptions from the point where minor citizenship is obtained spontaneously
 bhartiya praadhikaranon ne is kanoon kii vyakhya kii he ki ek vyakti kisi duusare desh kaa passport nahin rakh saktaa agar uske paas bhartiya passport he- yahaan tak ki ek bachche ke maamle main jise anya desh ke dwaara uskaa naagarik hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he or aisa ho saktaa he ki us desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar us bachche ko videsh yatra karne ke liye us desh ke passport kii aavashyaktaa ho - or bhartiya adaalaton ne is maamle par kaaryakari shakha vistrut vivek diya he
 Therefore, the foreign citizenship of India is not a full citizenship of India and thus it denies dual citizenship or dual nationality
 bharat kii kendriya sarkaar ek vyakti ko aavedan par, bharat ke ek videshi naagarik ke rup main panjikrut kar sakati he yadi vah vyakti bhartiya mul kaa he or aise desh se he jo kisi ek yaa anya rup main dohari naagarikta kii anumati detaa he
 Broadly speaking, "a person of Indian origin" is a citizen of another country who: dhyaan den ki bhartiya mata pita ke bachche swatah hi in aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin karte or isliye swatah osiai ke paatr nahin hai
 Indian Missions have been authorized to grant foreign citizenship of India within 30 days in cases where no serious crime is involved such as drug trafficking, moral turpitude, terrorist activities or any activities that have caused more than one year There can be jail
 videshi bhartiya naagarikta un logon ko nahin di ja sakati, jinhone videshi rashtriyata ko praapt kiya he, yaa praapt karne kii yojana bana rahen hai, athwa unke paas bhartiya passport bhi he
 This law requires that an Indian national who takes a foreign nationality must immediately return his / her Indian passport
 Those who are eligible for it can apply for registration of foreign Indian citizenship
 bharat ke videshi nagarikon ko bhartiya passport karne kii koi yojana nahin he, haalanki panjikaran kaa praaanpatr passport jaisi pustika main hoga mantriparishad ne bharat ke panjikrut videshi nagarikon ko biometric smart card dene ke prastaav par kaam karne ke liye bhartiya videsh mantralay ko dishanirdesh bhi die hai
 a foreign national of India can enjoy all the rights and privileges available to non-nris on the basis of parity
 isamen krishi evam vriksharopan sampatti main nivesh karne yaa saarvajanik karyaalay rakhane kaa adhikaar shaamil nahin he
 a person is required to keep his existing foreign passport which should include a new visa called a 'U' visa, which is a multi-purpose, multi-entry, visa and lasts a lifetime
 iske saath bharat kaa videshi naagarik kabhi bhi, kisi bhi prayojan ke liye, kitni bhi samay avadhi ke liye desh kaa daura kar saktaa he
 a Vietnamese citizen of India will not be able to enjoy the following rights even while living in India: Right to vote, President's office, vice-president's office, Supreme Court and High Court judges, members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, Vidhan Sabha or Legislative Council The right to become, the right to appoint in public services
 Also, foreign nationals of India are not eligible for inner line permit
 If they want to travel to some special places in India, then they have to apply for a protected area permit
 ek dilachasp sawaal yah he ki bharat ke videshi naagarik ke rup main panjikrut ek vyakti bharat main rahete hue apane desh ke rajanyik sangrakshan kaa adhikaar kho degaa
1930 ke rashtriyata kanoon ke sangharsh se sambandhit vishesh sawaalon par hegg sammelan kaa anuchhed 4 kahata he ki "ek rajya apane kisi vyakti ko aise rajya ke khilaaf rajanyik sangrakshan pradaan nahin kar saktaa jisaki rashtriyata aise vyaktiyon ke paas bhi ho
 yah maamla do chizon par nirbhar karata he: pehla, kya bharat kii sarkaar bharat ke videshi naagarikta ko sachhee naagarikta maanati he or is aadhaar par duusare desh ke dwaara rajanyik sangrakshan kaa adhikaar samaapt ho jaataa he; or doosraa, kya vyakti kaa apana desh ise pahachaanata he or bharat kii asweekruti ko sweekaar karata he
 Both points are questionable
 bharat videshi nagarikon ko ek swatantra yatra dastavej nahin detaa he parantu iske bajaay duusare desh ke passport main ek vija rakh detaa he
 If a person is only eligible to hold a passport from another country but cannot retain any form of Indian travel document, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the person is the only citizen of another country for the purpose of diplomatic protection
 bharat kii videshi naagarikta praapt karne par, british naagarik 1981 ke british rashtriyata adhinium kii dhara 4B ke tahat purna british naagarik ke rup main panjikaran nahin karvaa sakate
 yah unhen ek alag tareeke se purna british naagarikta praapt karne se nahin roak saktaa or yah unki british naagarikta ko radd nahin karata yadi ve dhara 4B ke tahat pehle se panjikrut hai
 The Public Information Bureau of India issued a press release which on 29 June 2005 clarified India's foreign citizenship scheme
 osiai yojana kaa purna vivaran bharat sarkaar ke grih mantralay web pej par uplabdh he
 Many other articles have also been written, including: osiai card bhartiya vija kaa vikalp nahin he or isliye osiai dharakon ko bharat main yatra karte samay vah passport apane paas rakhana chahie jo jivan bhar ke vija ko darshata he
 Although a dual citizenship is not fully developed, an OCI card holder has the privilege that multinational companies currently prefer to hire an OCI card holder for a multi-purpose and multi-entry lifetime tour of India
 Have a visa
 yah card dharak ko ek aaajeevan vija pradaan karata he, iske alaava ve alag se kaam karne kaa permit bhi praapt kar lete hai
 OCI holders are treated like nris in economic, financial and educational matters and do not have only political rights, do not have the right to purchase agricultural and plantation property or hold public office
 They do not even have to undergo registration with the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer on arrival in the country and can stay here for as long as they want
 osiai card dharak aaraam se yatra kar sakate heim or bharat main kaam le sakate hai, jabaki anya ko rojgaar vija par beurocratic deree hone par pakadaa ja saktaa he
 Many companies are following an active policy of PIO migration to expand their business
 bhartiya mishan osiai aavednon ke sakshi hai, puri duniya main vaanijya duutavas ke dwaara jari kiye gaye asankhya osiai card bhartiya vaanijya duutavas ke saath teji se bad rahen hai, isamen kaaphi sankhya main aavedan kiye ja rahe hai
 Any person who currently has a non-indian passport who can authenticate their Indianness up to three generations ago
 yahi niyam ek bhartiya naagarik ke jivan saathi par or bhartiya mul ke vyaktiyon par lagu hota he
 Citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries are not eligible to obtain a card of Indian origin as specified by the Central Government
 ek piaio card aam taur par jari hone kii tithi se pandrah varsh kii avadhi tak vaidya hota he
 This gives the holder the following advantages
 ek piaio card dharak: Before 1 January 1949, Indians were subject to the British under United Nations law
 dekhen british rashtriyata kanoon
 1 janvari 1949 or 25 janvari 1950 ke bich, bhartiya naagarikta ke bina british ke adheen rahete the, jab tak ve pehle se sanyukt raashtra or upniveshon yaa anya rashtramandal deshon kii naagarikta praapt nahin kar lete the
 When the Indian Constitution came into force on 26 January 1950, under the British Nationality Act, a person who became an Indian citizen also had the status of a Commonwealth citizen in terms of Indian membership of the Commonwealth and his Indian citizenship
 However, innumerable Indians did not obtain Indian citizenship when the Indian Constitution came into force and they remained under the British without citizenship status until they acquired citizenship of another Commonwealth country
 Any person who is subject to only one British will automatically lose British subordination after acquiring Indian citizenship or any other nationality including Indian foreign citizenship
 british ke adheen log sanyukt raashtra main na rahete hue bhi british rashtriyata adhinium kii dharaa 4B ke tahat british naagarik ke rup main panjikaran karvaa sakate hai yadi unke paas koi or rashtriyata yaa naagarikta nahin he or unhone 4 july 2002 ke baad kisi naagarikta yaa rashtriyata kaa swechha se tyaag nahin kiya he
 This facility is available from 30 April 2003 onwards
 ve log jo sanyukt raashtra main pravasit ho gaye hai, unke paas british naagarikta praapt karne kaa ek atirikt vikalp hota he, jise aamtaur par praathamikta di jaati he kyonki ve sthaanantaran yogya british naagarikta uplabdh dete hai
 The meaning of the term British subjugation changed from 1949, it is now more than a person holding citizenship of a Commonwealth country
 keval usee vyakti ko british passport diya jaataa tha jo bina naagarikta ke british ke adheen he
 See the British subject vartmaan main prayek duutavas ke apane maanak or niyam hai, jinka niyantran nayi dilli main kiya jaataa he, iske liye prakriya samaan he
 There is a lack of clarity in the application process for OCI
 aisa koi nirdhaarit prakashit samay nahin he jab aavedak ko anumodan mil jayega yaa use aavedan kii sahi sthiti kaa gyaan ho jayega
online aavedan buniyadi prakriya he, poochi gayi jaankaree dekar sambandhit stambh bharen, aavedan form kaa print len, jab aap sabamit batan ko clic karenge, yah pej gaayab ho jaayegaa or aapako form ko phir se bharna hoga
 sabhi stambh bharne ke baad form par hastakshar karen, iske baad aavedan ko osiai prabhag, dilli yaa epararo yaa nikatatam duutavas / vaanijya duutavas / ucch ayog ko bhej den
 aamtaur par agar aap dilli main aavedan karen to ek maah main aapako yah mil jaataa he
 This may vary among embassies, as all applications are finally approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs in Delhi
 kai maamalon main samay lag saktaa he kyoki agar adhikariyon ko zarurat mahasoos ho to osiai ko gahan satyaapan ke baad hi jari kiya jaataa he
 But it usually takes less than the immigrant visa approval time of the United States / United Nations or other Western countries

 shiv tandav stotra mahaan vidwaan evam param shivbhakt lankadhipati ravan dwaara virachit bhagwaan shiv kaa stotra he
 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga manyata he ki shivbhakt ravan ne kailash parvat hi uthaa liya tha or jab puure parvat ko hi lanka le chalane ko udyat hua us samay apni shakti par purna ahankaar bhav main tha
 If Mahadev did not like his ego, then Lord Shiva pressed a little bit with his thumb, then Kailash was situated again where he was
 shiv ke anany bhakt ravan kaa haath dab gaya or vah arttnad kar uthaa - "shankar shankar" - arthath kshamaa kariye, kshamaa kariye, or stuti karne lag gaya; jo kalantar main shiv tandav stotra kahalaaya
 Shiva was so happy with the Shiva Tandava Stotra that Ashutosh Lord Bholenath did not only give Ravana a gold Lanka with full prosperity and accomplishment as a boon, but also a boon of complete knowledge, science and immortality
 kaha jaataa he kii shiv tandav stotra sunne maatr se hi vyakti sampatti, samruddhi athwa santaadi praapt karata he The language of this source is unique and complex, but Mahavidwan Ravana made it in a few moments
 shiv stuti or prasannataa main yah stotra ram baan he

 The structure of the structure should have the ability to bear the force
 aisa dhaanchaa anke tribhujon ko milakar banaaya jaataa he
 Structures made of quadrilaterals and panchmen do not have this much capability
 trikonyukt dhaanche ko kanchi kehete hai
 It is completely innocent from the point of view of the forces to be tolerated and is self-fulfilling from the point of view of the elements
 aisi kainchiyan kaaphi lambey paaton ke liye banaai ja sakati hai tathaa bhaar padane par swayan santulit bhi rah sakati hai
 Why not work by placing simple concrete type long girder on the walls to make big roof roofs? Why triangular scissors are made? The roofs of moderately small roofs can be made by placing a plain girder of the proper size, but the girder is very heavy and expensive if it is too long
 bade paaton ke liye trikonyukt kainchiyan kaaphi majboot hone ke saath hi bahut halaki or sasti padati hai
 The joints of the scissors are made firm by the ribs not by making pins
 ribaton main kuch vishesh prakaar ke bal adhik aane lagate hai jinhen sahane ke liye in ribaton ko adhik majboot avashya hi banaaya jaataa he
 The weight of the entire roof drop is divided through the lights, coming to the upper joints of the triangles, dividing them evenly on all the scissors, and dividing them half-by-half with the weight of these scissors, finally falling to the base
 at: in bojhon kaa anumaan badi saavdhaanee se kar lenaa hota he
 These burdens always remain the same because they are called immovable loads
 sabhi urdhwadhar deevaaron tathaa dhaalu chhaton par bagal se chalanevaali hawa ke kaaran jo urdhwadhar daab padati he, vah vaayu daab kehalaati he or yah chal bhaar kii ginati main aati he
 The interiors of many storied houses carry the weight of the residents and lift furniture but it is negligible compared to other fixed loads
 dhaanchon ke vibhinn avyavon par padanevaale balon kaa pariklan bal tribhuj athwa bal bahubhujon ke siddhant ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 Engineers use the "bau signal" system for this
 yah reeti apekshaya saral he
 The forces can also be calculated by pure mathematics with the help of statics and trigonometry
 is prakaar se gananaa karne ke liye, kisi upyukt bindu ko dhurnakendre maanate hue, dhaanche ke kisi avyav main padanevaale agyaat bal ke ghurna se samikrut kar dete hai
 The more the number of small triangles are made in it, the greater the scissors of the roof of the roof or the girder of the bridge are anatomized
 yadi kisi lambey khambhe par bhaar daalaa jaae, to ek seemaa se aage chalakar vah khambha bich main se jhukne lagata he
 The same thing is made of small size triangles of appropriate size to withstand force
 yadi kisi lambey khambhe par bhaar daalaa jaae, to ek seemaa se aage chalakar vah khambha bich main se jhukne lagata he
 The same applies to the pauses of scissors
 at: kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikonon main vibhajit kar banaate hai
 The burden that is placed on the structure is called weight
 chal or achal bhaar kaa ullekh upar hua he
 If the weight is concentrated at some place, it is called the concentrated weight and if it is spread over the entire component, it is called divided weight
 railgadee, motor, trek aadi chalane vaale vaahanon ke bhaar ko charbhaar or ek baar ek disha main or turant baad duusari disha se aanevaale bhaar ko prayavarti bhaar or dhamaake ke saath aanevaale bhaar ko sanghaat bhaar kehete hai
 Materials also have a stress
 bhaar kii paristhiti ore pravriti ke kaaran tanan, sampeden, aparupan, anthan aadi pratibal ho saktaa he
 The change that results from the effect of stress is called distortion
 padaarthon main pratyasthata kaa gun hota he, kisi main kam or kisi main kam or kisi main adhik
 There is a limit of elasticity
 seemaa se adhik bal padane par padaarth tut jate hai
 Hooke established a rule in 1676 that if a force was applied to each substance within its range of elasticity, there would be a special ratio between the stress caused by it and the deformation that occurred in that substance
 san 1826 main doctor yang ne pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar padanevaale pratibalon ke kaaran vibhinn padaarthon main honevaali vikrutiyon ke anupaaton kaa nishchayatmak rup se pataa lagaaya
 This is called Young's elasticity modulus
 tanan evam sampeden sambandhi anupaaton ko E, aparupan sambandhi anupaaton ko C, yaa g akshar or aaytan sambandhi anupaaton ko k akshar dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he: Direct elasticity modulus anuprastha pratyasthata mapank The volume of substances is reduced by compression
 at: aaytani pratyasthata mapank Changes in elasticity parameters lead to aplomb and mechanization
 yadi kisi thos chad ko khinchaa jaae, to ham dekhte hai ki vah bich main se patali padakar tut jaati he or yadi pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar bal lagaakar khinchaa jaae to uski lambaai badhane ke saath hi sab jagahon se uski parshvik naap choti ho jaati he
 Similarly, if a rod is pressed, its lateral measurement increases
 at: khinchaav athwa dabaav ke kaaran kisi pratyaksh thos kii parshvik naapon main jo parivartan hota he, vah pason ke anupaat ke anusaar hota he
 Express it with the letter M
 vishuddh aparupak pratibal, do saamaan tathaa ek duusare kii virdohi disha main kaam karanevaale pratibalon ke mishran ke rup main hota he
 Their action lines are also at right angles to each other
 yadi dhure kaa ek chor diwaar main dridhtaa se ksaa hua he or uske duusare chor par anthan bal lagaaya jaataa he, to doosraa chor kuch mud jayega
 The angle, which he turns by making the angle from the radish line, will be his convulsive angle
 is kone kii sahaayta se dhure kaa anthan bal nikaala ja saktaa he
 Testing of materials used in engineering is essential
 jis paristhiti main samagriyon kaa upyog hota he usee paristhiti main unako rakhkar, unka pareekshan karnaa chahie
 The test takes place in two ways: one has knowledge of the molecular organization of materials and is seen physically by pulling, pressing, shearing, punching, bending and turning to see how they are able to bear
 bhautik reeti se samagriyon kaa pareekshan karne ke liye aajkal ek yantra bana he jise hounfield tensometer kehete hai
 Its methodology is very simple and even a normal person can use it with a little training
 isse samagriyon kii samathrya, bhaar vikruti, abhishranti ityadi kaa gyaan saralata se ho jaataa he
 Deformation is very subtle or temporary as long as the stress on a substance remains within the range of elasticity of that substance
 bhaar hatate hi vah padaarth apni mul avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 But if the stress is above the threshold of elasticity, then the deformation is substantial and more permanent
 vibhanjak bhaar pratyasthata kii seemaa se kaaphi adhik hota he, par vyapaarik or upyogita kii drushti se yah bhaar kam hi rakhaa jaataa he or ise paraabhav bindu kehete hai tathaa ise hi vibhanjak bhaar maan liya jaataa he
 The limit of elasticity is planned at the time of design, weighting of much less than the bearable load
 at: yah vyaavhaarik bhaar atyadhik sahane yogya bhaar se jis anupaat main kam ho, us anupaat ko us padaarth kaa abhaya gunank yaa abhayank kehete hai
 It is expressed by the following formula: bhinn bhinn padaarthon ke abhayank vibhinn avasthaaon main vibhinn hote hai
 Hard steel is characterized by three in static load and five to eight in movable load and nine to 13 in alternating moving load
 padaarthon kii kathorta se unke tanaav, sampeden, avarupan aadi balon kaa anumaan saralata se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Modern methods of hardness testing are based on the principles of static dentistry and dynamic dentistry

 vibhavamaapi ek vidyut upkaran he jo kisi paripath ke do binduon ke bich vibhavaantar maapne ke kaam aata he
 Until the movable coil voltmeter or numerical voltmeter was not developed, the potential was measured by the voltmeter itself
 isi liye iske naam main 'meter' yaa 'maapi' aayaa hua he
 This method of volumetric measurement was introduced in 1841 by John Christian Pogendroff
 vibhavamaapi ek adarsh voltmetre ke kaary karata hai
 This device is used in the measurement of differential measurement, but at the same time it can also be found to have resistance and resistance
 yadi ek sthir dhara ek lambey or samaan taar se pravaahit ho or us taar kii ek ek lambaai kaa pratirodh pa ho, to taar kii ek lambaai kaa vibhavantar va = dha x pa taar ke ek samaan rahane ke kaaran us taar kii lambaai l kaa vibhavantar = dha x pa x l
 Now, if we group a cell whose electric carrying force is b by a galvanometer and connect it between the points a and b of the potentiometer, then there will be some current and deflection in that thermometer
 yah dhara vibhavamaapi ke binduon ke vibhavantar or sal ke vibhavantar ke antar kii samaanupati hogi, kyonki donon vibhav ek duusare vipareet disha main dhara bhejne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 If point b is moved on the wire, the difference between points a and b will change
 is prakaar taar kii ek aisi lambaai hogi jab vinduon k or kha ke bich vibhavantar thik cell ke vidyut vaahak bal k baraabar hoga or us samay dharamapi main koi vikshep nahin hoga
 If the length of the wire is L1, then a = 1 = Dh x p x 1
 isi prakaar yadi kisi pramanik cell se, jiskaa vidyutwak bal va2 he, prayog kiya jaae or galavanomapi main shunya vikshep ke liye aavashyak taar kii lambaai l2 ho to va2 = dha x pa x l2 astu, yadi dhara donon prayogon main sthir rahe to And the difference of unknown electric carrying force, kisi vibhavamaapi se jitna nunatam vibhavantar nap saktaa he us yantra kii 'sugrahita' kehalaata he or jo ucchtam vibhavantar napata he use paraas kehete hai
 If 100 cm of a potentiometer
 If the resistance of the wire is 10 ohms and current of 0
01 ampere is flowing, then the voltage between the two ends of the core will be 0
1 volts
 us main taar ko naapane yogya nunatam lambaai ke siron ke bich kaa vibhavantar 0
0001 volt hoga, jise vibhavamaapi kii sugrahita kahenge
 In 1885, Fleming put forward the principle of a very accurate and sensitive voltmeter
 usee siddhant par krampaton ne ek vibhavamaapi banaaya jo krampaton vibhavamaapi ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is very realistic and sensitive
 disht dhara vibhavamaapi kii bhaanti hi prayavartti dhara vibhavamaapi bhi vibhavantar naapta he
 In both types of instruments, the unknown potential is perfectly balanced by the partial differential of the main circuit of the voltmeter, but the potential of the alternating current brought to equilibrium in the voltmeter should not only be equal in magnitude but also in the opposite direction in phase
 And two independent adjustments are required
 prayavarti dhara vibhavamaapi do virgon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai jinhen ham dhruviya or nirdenshanki kehete hai
 Poetry, poetry or poetry, is the genre of literature in which a story or emotion is artistically expressed by a language
 bharat main kavita kaa itihaas or kavita kaa darshan bahut purana he
 Its beginning can be understood from Bharatmuni
 kavita kaa shabdic arth he kaavyatmak rachana yaa kavi kii kriti, jo chhandon kii shrunkhalaaon main vidhivat baandhi jaati he
 Poetry is the syntax that makes the mind complete with any juices or impulses
 arthath vahjisamen chune hue shabdon ke dwaara kalpana or manovegon kaa prabhaav daalaa jaataa he
 In Rasgangadhar the exponent of the meaning of 'delightful' is called 'poetry'
 'arth kii romaniyata' ke antargat shabd kii romaniyata bhi samajhakar log is lakshan ko sweekaar karte hai
 But 'elegance' of 'earth' can be of many types
 isse yah lakshan bahut spasht nahin he
 Literature is the most appropriate sign of the poet Vishwanath
 uske anusaar 'rasaatmak vaakya hi kavy he'
 Ras is the soul of poetry of pleasant communication of the souls
 kavyprakash main kavy teen prakaar ke kahe gaye hai, dhwani, gunibhoot vyangy or chitra
 Sound is one in which the hidden meaning is dominant, rather than the meaning derived from the words
 gunibhoot byangy vah he jisamen gaun ho
 a picture or an ornament is one in which a miracle is done without exorcism
 in teenon ko kramshah uttam, madhyam or adham bhi kehete hai
 The poetic lighter's emphasis seems to be more on the hidden sense, not on the stimulus of the juice
 kavy ke do or bhed kiye gaye hai, mahakavy or khand kavy
 The epic canto and its hero must be a deity, king, or Dhirodatta, a rich Kshatriya
 usamen shringaar, vir yaa shant rason main se koi ras pradhan hona chahie
 Periodic compassion; Humor etc
 and juices and other people's references should also come
 kam se kam aath sarg hone chahie
 In the epic, the place of Sandhya, Surya, Chandra, Ratri, Prabhat, Mrigaya, Mountains, Forest, Ritu, Sagar, Sanyog, Vipralambha, Muni, Pur, Yajna, Ranprayana, Vivah etc
 should be imminent
 kavy do prakaar kaa mana gaya he, drishy or shravy
 Visual poetry is that which is shown by acting, such as drama, skit, etc
 which is readable and listenable, it is audible
 shravy kavy do prakaar kaa hota he, gadhy or padya
 The epic and Khandakavya of the verse poetry have been called two distinctions
 gadhy kavy ke bhi do bhed kiye gaye hai- katha or aakhyayika
 Champu, Virud and Karambhaka are considered three types of poetry and poetry
 saamanyat: sanskrit ke kavy-sahitya ke do bhed kiye jate hai- drishy or shravy
 In addition to visual poetic words, the costumes, gestures, motifs, actions and performances of the characters bring excitement to the audience's heart
 drishykavy ko 'roopak' bhi kehete hai kyonki uskaa rasaswadan netron se hota he
 Audible poetry communicates juice to the heart of readers and listeners through words
 shravyakavy main padya, gadhy or champoo kaavyon kaa samavesh kiya jaataa he
 The word 'padya', which is removed from the padma in the motion, indicates the primacy of motion
 at: padyakavy main taal, lay or chand kii vyavastha hoti he
 Again there are two strains of the verse - the epic and the Khandakavya
 khandakavy ko ‘muktkavy’ bhi kehete hai
 In the Khandakavya, instead of a complete chronicle of life like the epic, one part is described
 kavitv ke saath-saath sangitatkata kii pradhanta hone se hi inako hindi main ‘geetikavy’ bhi kehete hai
 The meaning of 'geeti' is to express the emotional spirit of the heart in a phased manner
 geeti kii aatma bhavatirek he
 The poet of his emotional sensation and imagination makes the narrative emotional
 geetikavy main kavyashastreey roodhiyon or paramparaon se mukt hokar vaiyaktik anubhav ko saralata se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 By nature, the shape-type of lyrical poetry is smaller than the epic
 in sab tattvon ke sahyog se sanskrit muktakkavy ko ek utkrisht kavyarup mana jaataa he
 Muktakavya has become more popular than the epics
 sanskrit main geetikavy muktak or prabandh donon roopon main praapt hota he
 The best example of managerial lyricism is Meghdoot
 adhikansh prabandh geetikavy isi ke anukaran par likhe gayi hai
 Muktak is that in which each verse is independent in itself
 iske sundar udhaaharan amaruukshatak or bhatruharishtakatray hai
