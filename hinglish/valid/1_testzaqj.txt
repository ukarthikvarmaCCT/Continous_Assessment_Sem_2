1400 ke baad se vaadyayantra ke vikaas main pashchimi europe kaa prabhutv rahaa - vastav main, sabase pramukh parivartan punarjagarankalin avadhi ke dauraan hue
 gayan yaa nrity kaa saath dene ke alaava vaadyayantron ne anya prayojanon main kaam kiya or pradarshankartaaon ne unhen ekal upkaran ke rup main istemaal kiya
 Keyboards and tentacles evolved as polyphonic instruments, and composers developed complex compositions using more advanced tablature
 sangeetkaaron ne, vishisht vaadyon ke liye sangeet ke tukade dizine karnaa shuru kiya
 In the later half of the sixteenth century, orchestration became a common practice as a method of writing music for various instruments
 jahaan vyaktigat kalakaaron ne swayan kaa vivek lagaaya tha, vahiin sangeetkaaron ne ab vaadyavrindkaran ko lagu kiya
 Popular music dominated the polyphonic style and the instrument makers responded accordingly
 lagbhag 1400 main shuruyaat ke saath, sangeet vaadyayantron ke vikaas kii dar main atyadhik vruddhi hui kyonki rachanaaon ko adhik gatisheel dhwani kii aavashyaktaa thi
 People began writing books about the making, playing and cataloging of instruments; The first such book was Sebastian Firdung's 1511 treatise Musica getuscht und angezogen
 Firdung's work is considered particularly complete because it also included descriptions of "irregular" instruments such as hunter's horns and cow bells, although Firdung has also criticized them
 baad main anya pustaken bhi ain, jisamen shaamil thim arnolt shlik kii Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten usee varsh ai yah pustak organ nirmaan or organ vaadan par ek granth he
 Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance period, one book is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments in which they are given comparative size
 maaikel pretorius kii is pustak, sintagma musicum ko solahavin sadi ke vaadyayantron kaa ek aadhikarik sandarbh mana jaataa he
 In the sixteenth century, the "classical motifs" that instrument makers gave to most instruments continue to this day, such as the violin
 Format beauty was also noticed - listeners were just as fascinated by beauty as an instrument
 Therefore, manufacturers paid special attention to materials and workmanship and instruments became collectibles in museums and homes
 yahi avadhi thi jiske dauraan nirmaataaon ne, sangeet-sanghon, aise dal jo in vaadyayantron ke samoohon ke liye likhi gai rachana ko bajaate the, kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye ek hi prakaar ke upkarnon kaa nirmaan vibhinn aakaaron main karnaa shuru kiya
 Equipment manufacturers developed qualities that are still in operation today
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab bahu-keyboard vaale organ maujuud the, ekal tehraav vaale organ pandrahavin sadi ke armbh main ubhare
 ye tehraav lay ke ek mishran ko utpann karne ke liye the, yah ek aisa vikaas tha jo us vakt ke sangeet kii jatilta ke liye aavashyak tha
 To improve portability, the trumpets were developed in today's modern form and players used mutes to mix in chamber music
 satrahavin sadi kii shuruyaat se sangeetkaaron ne or adhik bhavuk style kii rachanaaen nirmit karnaa shuru kiya
 He felt that a monophonic style is more suited to emotional music and wrote musical pieces for instruments that complemented the human singing of sounds
 natijatan, aise kai upkaran, jo vistrut seemaa or gatishiltaa ke kaabil nahin the or jiske chalate unhen bhavaheen ke rup main dekha jane laga, pasand se baahar ho gaye
 One such instrument was oboe
 Bending instruments such as the violin, viola, baritone, and various tentacles continued to dominate popular music
 lagbhag 1750 ke aasapaas shuru hote hue, guitar kii badhati lokapriyata ke kaaran tamboora, sangeet rachanaaon se gaayab ho gaya
 With the increase in the prevalence of stringed orchestras, there was a resurgence of wind instruments such as flutes, oboes and bassoons, in response to the monotony of listening to them
 satrahavin sadi ke madhya main, us vaadya kaa jise shikari kii sing kaha jaataa tha ek "kalatmak vaadyayantra" main roopantaran hua or usamen ek lambaa tub, ek parimit bor, ek chaudee ghanti or adhik vyapak range joda gaya
 The details of this change are unclear, but in the modern horn or more common language, the French horn emerged by 1725
 a slide trumpet was born, a changed form with a long mouthpiece that glided in and out, giving the player an infinite adjustment to the pitch
 turahi kaa yah bhinn rup, iske vaadan main shaamil kathinaayee ke kaaran alokapriy rahaa
 In the Baroque period, organ-related changes occurred in the organ, as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stagnation more meaningful and added some equipment such as expressive paddles
 Sachs saw this trend as a "collapse" of the organ's normal sound
 vaadyayantron ko vargeekrut karne ke kai alag-alag tareeke hai
 All methods examine some combination of the physical properties of the instrument, how the music is performed on the instrument, and the position of the instrument in the orchestra or other musical groups
 kuch tareeke, visheshgyon ke bich is asahmati ke parinamswaroop utpann hote hai ki vaadyayantron kaa vargeekaran kaise kiya janaa chahie
 While a complete survey of classification systems is beyond the scope of this article, a summary of the major systems is as follows
 ek pracheen pranali, jo kam se kam 1 shatabdi i
pus
 se chali aa rahi he, vaadyayantron ko chaar mukhya vargeekaran samoohon main vibhajit karti he: ve upkaran jahaan dhwani taar hilaane se utpann hoti he; ve vaadyayantra jahaan dhwani hawa ke khandon ke kampan ke dwaara utpann hoti he; lakdi yaa dhaatu ke bane parakashan vaadyayantra; or chamade ke mukh vaale parakashan upkaran yaa drum
 victor-charles mahilon ne baad main, bahut kuch isi prakaar kii pranali ko apanaaya
 ve brussels main sangitvidyalay main vaadyayantra sangrah ke sangrakshak the or sangrah kii 1888 kii suchi ke liye vaadyayantron ko chaar samoohon main vibhajit kiya; tarayukt vaadya, haav vaale vaadya, parakashan vaadya or drum
 Erik von Hornbostel and Kurt Sax later took the ancient method and in 1914 published a comprehensive new scheme for classification in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie
 unki paddati ko aaj vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he or ise aksar hornbostel-sacks paddati ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The original sax-hornbostel method classified instruments into four main groups: sacks ne baad main ek paanchvaan varg joda, electrophone, jaise thermin, jo electronic tareeke se dhwani utpann karte hai
 There are several sub-groups within each class
 is pranali kii aalochana kii gai or ise pichley varshon main sanshodhit kiya gaya, lekin iskaa vyapak rup se prayog organologist or ethnomyuicologist dwaara hi kiya jaataa he
 Andre Schaffner, patron of the Musée de l'homme, disagreed with the saxe-hornbostel system and in 1932 developed his own system
 shafnar kaa maananaa tha ki ek vaadyayantra ke vargeekaran kaa nirdhaaran, uske vaadan kii vidhi ke bajaay uski shaareerik sanrachana ko karnaa chahie
 His method divided the instruments into two classes: instruments whose body is solid and vibratory, and instruments that have staggered air
 pashchimi vaadyayantron ko bhi, usee parivaar ke anya upkarnon ke saath tulana main aksar unki sangeet seemaa dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 These terminologies are based on the classification of singing sounds: kuch upkaran ek se adhik shrenee main aate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, celo ko yaa to tener yaa baas mana ja saktaa he, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki iskaa sangeet samooh main kaise feet baithta he or trombone ho saktaa he olto, tener, yaa baas or french horn, baas, baritone, tener, yaa olto, is baat par nirbhar karte hue kii kis sa par range yah khelaa jaataa he
 Template: Vocal and instrumental pitch ranges kai vaadyayantron main range, unke naam ke hisse ke rup main hota he: sopraano sexophone, tener sexophone, baritone sexophone, olto bansuri, baas bansuri, olto recorder, baas guitar, aadi
 Additional adjectives describe an instrument above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabas clarinet
 jab kisi vaadya ke naam main istemaal kiye jate hai to ye shabd saapeksh hote hai, jo vaadyayantra ke range ko uske parivaar ke anya upkarnon kii tulana main varnit karte hai or na kii maanav awaz ke range main yaa anya pariwaron ke upkarnon kii tulana main
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek baas bansuri kaa range C3 se F♯6 tak he, jabaki ek baas clerinet ek saptak neeche bajataa he
 Instrumental production is a specialized occupation that requires years of training, practice and sometimes becoming an apprentice
 vaadyayantron ke adhikansh nirmaataa, vaadyayantra kii kisi ek style ke visheshgy hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ek luthiar keval tharawaale vaadya banaata he
 Some producers make only one type of instrument such as a piano
 bhale hi vaadyayantra main dhwani kaise bhi utpann hoti ho, kai vaadyayantron main upyogkarta interfes ke rup main ek kunjeepatal hota he
 Keyboard instruments are instruments that are played by a musical keyboard
 har kunjee ek yaa ek se adhik dhwani utpann karti he; adhikansh kunjeepatal upkarnon main, in dhvaniyon main utar-chadhaav karne ke liye atirikt saadhan hote hai 
 ve hawa ke hilne se yaa pump karne se dhwani utpann kar sakate hai, hilte taron ko thokkar yaa khinchakar, electronic tareekon dwaara, yaa kisi anya tareeke se
 kabhi-kabhi, aise vaadyayantra jinamein aamtaur par ek kunjeepatal nahin hota he, jaise gloucenspil, unamem ek kunjeepatal laga diya jaataa he
 Although they do not have any movable part and are played with a mallet held in the hands of the player, they have the same physical arrangement of keys and produce sound waves in a similar manner

 Marshall's disciple John Maynard Keynes's treatise entitled 'general Theory of Employment, Interest and Money' is a special book of economics
 vastav main is granth ne paashchaatya arthshaastriyon kii vichaardhaara ko amul parivartit kar diya he
 On this basis, several important theories have emerged, such as Harad Domar's famous development model, Leontief's in-put output model
 pro samulson maanate hai ki koi bhi vyakti yaa arthshaastri ek baar keens ke vishleshan se prabhavit hone ke baad puraani vichaardhaaraon kii ore nahin lautaa
 Keynes's influence also led to his former critics
 ve bahut spashtvaadi rahe or isi kaaran unke aarthik vichaar sulajhe hue hai
 He also made considerable contribution in the field of practicals
 america kii new deal, antarashtriya mudrakosh tathaa antarashtriya punarnirmaan evam vikaas bank aadi kii sthapana main unka sakriy yogadan rahaa he
 Keynes has been the father of microeconomics
 isi hetu unka granth 'saamaanya siddhant' itnaa lokapriy hua
 Anyway, in this book he explained the macroeconomic analysis
 unhone arthshaastra ko kul aay tathaa prabhavi maang kaa siddhant diya
 According to him, employment depends on effective demand
 prabhavi maang swayan upyog tathaa viniyog par nirbhar karti he
 Consumption is determined by the size of income and the consumption propensity of society
 at: yadi rojgaar badhanaa he to upbhog tathaa viniyog donon main vruddhi karnaa chahie
 Keynes did not accept any of the static definitions of income given by Marshall, Peegu, Fisher, because Keynes did not throw any light on the elements that determine employment and income levels in the economy at a particular time
 
 keens ne sarvapratham rashtriya aay kii paribhaasha is prakaar di jisase use samaaj main rojgaar kaa nirdhaaran karne main sahaayta mili
 Just as 'price' is the basis of Marshall's value theory, the basis of Keynes's employment theory is 'income'
 unke anusaar 'kul aay=kul upyogvyay+kul viniyog ' hoga
 He said for 'national income' that since there is' income = utilization + savings and 'expenditure = consumption + appropriation', hence 'use + savings = consumption + appropriation' or 'savings = appropriation'
 keens kaa aay vishleshan hi hamen yah nirdesan detaa he ki arthvyavastha ko baari utaar-chadhaav se bachaane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki bachat or viniyog main samanta banaae rakhaa jaae
 To overcome the effects of the recession, Keynes has supported government spending and policies to increase consumption propensity by cheap infrastructure, public works and proper distribution of funds
 kines kaa siddhant viksit deshon par adhik tathaa alpaviksit deshon par kam lagu hota he
 But if effective demand and savings can also be generated in underdeveloped countries, Keynes's economics can apply there as well
 vastut: vartmaan vishwa kii berajgari, mandi, moolyavuddhi aadi ko dekhte hue keens kii nitiyon par dridhtaa se chalanaa hi uchit hoga nishchay hi sabase adhik keens ke siddhanton se prabhavit he

 Other theorists argue that a business has a moral duty not to limit itself to serving the interests of its owner or stockholders and to not just follow the law
 They believe that a business has its ethical responsibilities Stakeholders, individuals interested in conducting the business, this may include employees, customers, vendors, local even Right or a copy of the entire society

 The revival of contract theory in political philosophy became particularly popular later in its stance, a major contribution being John Ravels's 'A Theory of Justice' and the advent of a conscience-based approach to solving business problems
 The "quality movement" emerged in the 1980s
 Professors Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunphy proposed a version of contract theory for business, which they called Unified Social Contract Theory
 He has propounded that the best way to resolve conflicting interests is an impartial agreement between the two sides, which should co-ordinate these things: i) general principles, which all intellectuals agree on, and ii) general principles
 Formulation between interested parties by genuine agreements
 naitik mudde tab khadey hote hai jab companiyaan kanoonee yaa saanskrithik maamalon main paraspar virdohi maanak apanaati hai, jaisaa ki bahurashtriya companiyaan vibhinn deshon main alag-alag tareekon se kaam karti hai
 For example, the question arises whether a company should follow the laws of its own country or the laws of the developing country where it operates and where it has to follow less stringent laws? To illustrate this, the United States law prohibits companies in the matter of bribery, whether it is a country company or a foreigner, but in other parts of the world, bribery is an acceptable traditional way of doing business
 isi prakaar kii samasyaayein bal shramikon, karmchaaree kii suraksha, kaam ke ghante, mazdooree, bhedbhaav or paryaavaran sangrakshan kanoon ke paalan ko lekar paidaa hoti hai
 Sometimes it is claimed that Gresham's law of morality applies but good moral conduct excludes bad moral conduct
 yah daawa kiya jaataa he ki ek pratispardhi kaarobaari maahaul main log unheen companiyon ko jivit samajhate hai jinaki bhoomika adhiktam laabh arjeet karne kii rahati he
 As a more comprehensive compliance and ethics program, many companies have formulated policies relating to ethical conduct of employees in internal affairs
 yah nitiyon board main saamaanya sambodhan ke rup main ho sakati hai jinhen atyant samanyikrut bhashaa main prastut kiya jaataa he, athwa yah vistrut nitiyaan bhi ho sakati hai, jo vishesh vyavaharik aavashyaktaaon ho 
 ve aamtaur par shramikon kii company kii ummiido ko pahchaanane ke liye or vyapaar karne main pesh aa rahi kuch athwa adhik naitik samasyaon ko hal karne main maargdarshan dene ke liye hoti hai
 It is hoped that such a policy will create widespread moral awareness, stabilize their use and help to avoid moral disasters
 companiyon kii badhati sankhya ke saath-saath karmchaariyon kii bhi aavashyaktaa he jo kaarobaar sanchaalan se sambandhit seminar main hissaa len, jisamen aksar company kii nitiyon, vishesh maamle kaa adhyayan or kanoonee aavashyaktaaon kii charchaa hoti he
 Some companies even want their employees to sign an agreement that they will follow the company's rules of conduct
 kai companiyaan paryaavarniya karkon kaa akalan karti hai jo karmchaariyon ko aniatik aacharan main sanlagn kar sakate hai
 a competitive business environment can lead to unethical conduct
 jhooth bolne kii ummid vyapaar jaise kshetra main kii ja sakati he
 An example of this may be the immoral actions surrounding the Salomon Brothers
 har koi company kii nitiyon kaa samarthan karata he, jisase naitik aacharan sanchalit hota he
 Some claim that ethical problems may have a better basis for letting employees use their decisions
 anya logon kaa vishwaas he ki corrporate naitikta kii nitiyaan mukhya rup se upyogi chintaaon main nihit hai or ve mukhya rup se company ke kanoonee daayitv hai yaa ek bhala corrporate naagarik banakar uskaa dikhaava kar saarvajanik samarthan paaya ja saktaa he
 Ideally the company would like to avoid a lawsuit because its employees would follow the rules
 If there is a lawsuit, then the company can claim that this problem does not arise if the employees properly followed only the code
 kabhi-kabhi company kii naitikta ke code kaa sambandh company kii vaastavik prathaon se tut jaataa he
 Thus, this type of conduct is clearly adopted by management, which results in bad policies that create fraudulent policies, while it is one of the best marketing tools
 zyaadaatar nitikaar safal hone ke liye ek aachaar niti kaa suzav dete hai, jo is prakaar ho: Ethics officers were formally appointed by organizations in the mid-1980s
 is nayi bhoomika ek utprerak vah dhokhadhadi, bhrashtachar or durupyog se jude ghotaalon kii ek shrunkhlaa he jisase tatkaaleen samay main america kaa raksha udyog peedit tha
 This led to the formation of the Defense Industry Initiative, an initiative to promote and ensure ethical business practices in all industries
 DII ne armbh main companiyon ke liye naitikta prabandhan ke maanak tay kiye
1991 main nitishastra evam anupaalan adhikari association - multah nitishastra adhikari sangh -kii sthapana vyavsaay nitishastra kendra main prabandhan ke liye jimmedaar logon ke liye ek peshewar sanghathan ke rup main sthapit kiya gaya tha taaki ve naitik sarvottam prathaon ko jaan saken
sadsyta teji se badi or use jald hi ek swatantra sanghathan ke rup main sthapit kiya gaya
 Another important work ethic for companies was the decision to appoint a compliance / compliance officer, which required the approval of the Federal Penal Guidelines 1991 for organizations, which set the standard for an establishment that possessed federal felony convictions
 But had to apply for exemption in sentence
 haalanki sajaa dene main nyaayadhishon kii sahaayta karne or apane prabhaav se sarvottam prathaon kii sthapana karne main madad karne ke mahatvapurn nattejey paanevaala rahaa
 In the wake of the scandals of many companies between 2001-04, even small and medium-sized companies began appointing ethics officers
 They often report to the CEO and to assess the ethical impact of the company's activities
 They are responsible for the company's ethical policies and provide information to employees
 ve vishesh rup se aniatik or avaidh kaary ko ujagar karne yaa un kaaryon ko rokane main ruchi rakhte hai
 This trend is partly due to the sarbanes-oxley Act of the USA, which was implemented in response to these scandals
 isi prakaar is pravriti se jude ek or maamle main jokhim moolyankan adhikariyon kii niyukti kii shuruuaat kii gayi, jo is baat kii nigaraanee karata he ki kaise shairdharak kaa nivesh company ke faisle se prabhavit ho saktaa he
 The influence of ethical executives in the market is not clear
 yadi niyukti mukhya rup se kanoonee aavashyaktaaon kii ek pratikriya ke rup main kii jaati he to yah sweekaar kar lenaa chahie ki uskaa prabhaav nunatam hoga, kam se kam, alpavadhi ke liye
 sankshep main naitik vyavsaay ke vyavhaar kaa nateeja ek korporate samskruti main lagaataar naitik vyavhaar ke mahatv, ek samskruti or vaataavaran se nikalataa he, jo aam taur par pratishthan main upar se utpann hota he
 Only the establishment of monitoring of the state of ethics is insufficient to motivate ethical behavior, for that a systemic program with continuous support from the principal management is necessary
 naitik aacharan kii sthapana ek korporate samskruti or kisi nishchit company ke pare bhi sambhav he, jo kisi vyakti ke aarambhik naitik prashikshan par bahut nirbhar karata he, anya sansthaaen jo kisi vyakti ko prabhavit karti hai, vah he jis company main vah kaam karata he uskaa pratispardhi kaarobaari maahaul or vastav main puraa samaaj
 Religious views of historical and global importance on business ethics sometimes underestimate business ethics
 vishesh rup se asia or madhya purv main dharmik or saanskrithik pariprekshya ne vyavsaay ke aacharan par ek majboot prabhaav choda he or vyapaar mulyon kaa srijan kiya he
 Examples include: vyavsaayik naitikta ko vyavsaay ke darshan se pratishthit kiya janaa chahie, yah darshan kii vah shakha he, jiskaa sambandh vyavsaay or arthshaastra ke darshanik, rajnatik or naitik aadhaar se he
 Business ethics operates on the basis, for example, that ethical conduct is possible in a private business — people who have a dispute on grounds, such as libertarian socialists, have defined business ethics as going beyond the appropriate ideology
 kaarobaar kaa darshan bhi sawaalon se judaa hota hai jaise vyavsaay kii saamaajik jimmedaariyaan kya-kya hoti hai, vyavsaay prabandhan siddhant, vyaktvaad ke siddhant banaam samashtiwad; bazaar main pratibhaagiyon ke bich mukt ichha shakti, swa-hit kii bhoomika; adrishy haath siddhant, saamaajik nyaay kii aavashyaktaaon or prakritik adhikaar he, khaskar vyapaar udhyam ke sambandh main sampada adhikaar
 Business ethics also deals with political economy, which is economic analysis from a political and historical point of view
 raajnneetik arthvyavastha kaa sambandh aarthik kaaryon ke vitaran parinaam se he
 He asks who benefits from economic activity and who has suffered, whether the result of distribution is justified or not, is a central moral issue

 Furry dance apane aarmabhik kaal se hi ahir ek jujharu or ghumantu jati rahi he
 Whose basic profession has been animal husbandry and herdsmen
 pahari kshetron ke gujaron kii jivan style kii tarah ahiron ne bhi aarmabhik kaal main pashuon ko charaane tathaa gaanv-kshetra kii simaaon ko langhane kaa kaam kiya
 Due to pastoralism, they had to do laborious tasks like running, jumping, wrestling and running sticks
 shram kii prakruti ne inaki jivan sanrachana or manoranjan ke tatwon kaa nirdhaaran kiya
 Although the work of Ahirs of every region remained pastoral, yet the style of 'raut Nach', born in the Chhattisgarhi Yadavas, could not come in the Yadavas of Bhojpuri region due to differences in locational tendencies
 yahaan nrity kii do prakaar kii sheliyaan janmin : jaanghia nrity or fari yaa faruwahi nrity
 In both of these styles, Birha was basically adopted as singing
 is prakaar birahaa vishuddh rup se ahiron kaa geet he tathaa jaanghia or fari ahirau nrity
 In both dances and furries, the stature and strength of the performers is made by seeing the agility of the feet
 jaanghia nrity main jaangh par jaanghia pahana jaataa he jisamen taanke gaye ghunghru, kadamtalon, mrudang / nakkaara kii aawaaj par layaaddh ho kar man or sharir donon ko zankrut kar dete hai
 The team of chorus singers and choreographers along with the lead singer enchant the audience
 fari bhi mulat: ahir varg kaa hi nrity he
 Not only is the use of carvings in this, iron-weighted pulses are also used in a wonderful way as instruments
 do for ek-ek hatheli main hote hai jo aapas main is prakaar takaraa kar bajaaye jate hai ki shrota zankrut ho jaae
 Hence it is called Fari or Faruvahi dance
 yahaan yah bhi spasht kar dena hoga ki fari nrity main ghunghru, for, nakkaara ke alaava kartaal kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The choreographer plays kartal in one hand
 is nrity main kalakaar uchhalte-kudate, naachte dur tak chale jate hai or nakkaare kii aawaaj par kadamon kii chaal badalte hue laut aate hai
 Sometimes there are various tricks on the ground
 darasal fari nrity ke bhi do bhaag hote hai
 In the first part, the team members sing the birhaas playing iron fires and dance and sing with slow and fast steps on the changing sounds of the carvings
 gayan kii jimmedaari for bajaane vaale sadasyon kii hoti he jabaki nritykaron ke uchhalte, kudate nrity karne ke kaaran aisi sthiti nahin hoti ki ve gayaki main saath de saken
 They have lost their power
 ve paseene-paseene ho jate hai
 The elasticity of their waistline, the tinkling of the steps and the ghungroos in the foot excite the atmosphere
 nritykar jo purush paridhaan main hi hote hai, nakkaare kii dhwani kaa anusaran kar baraabar kadam-taal badalte, uchhalte, naachte rahete hai
 In the second part of the furry dance, only the dance is given place by stopping the singing
 is avasthaa main pharon kaa bajaanaa band kar diya jaataa he par nakkaara bajataa rahata he
 The dancers also perform circus feats like circus, in harmony with the sound of carvings
 jaise ki hawa main ghota lagaana, palati maarna, apane sharir par saat se aath logon ko chadhaanaa yaa apane upar baiylgaadee chadhaanaa yaa chaati par eenton ko phodna aadi
 In furry dance, both these types are used in turn so that the audience can enjoy the theme change
 darasal ek geet samaapt hone or duusare ke prarambh karne ke interval main nrity vaale bhaag ko sammilit kar liya jaataa he
 Khadi birha is sung only while standing, so all the members of the furry dance and singing present this mode
 aadhunik birahaa jise fari nrity main gaaya ja rahaa he, chaarkadiya birahaa or lorki gayaki kaa sanyukt rup he
 Often lyrical songs are sung in birha singing
 yadhyapi kii filmi gaanon ke prabhaav ke kaaran birahaa gayaki main kuch parivartan dekhne ko miltaa he tathaa fari gayak kai baar lok prachlit bhojpuri gaanon ko bhi apni gayaki main prayog karne lage hai tathaapi birahaa kathatmak geet hi hote hai ye kisi na kisi kahani par aadhaarit hote hai
 In these, mythological, historical and other miraculous stories are also given place
 adhikansh birahaa gayak dharmik prasangon ko pramukhataa se gaate hai

 Rajput painting is the predominant style of Indian painting

 In the last days of the Mughal period, several Rajput kingdoms arose in different regions of India, of which Mewar, Bundi, Malwa etc
 are the main ones
 in rajyon main vishisht prakaar kii chitrakala style kaa vikaas hua
 Due to the characteristics of these different styles, he was given the name of Rajput style
 rajasthani chitrastyli kaa pehla vaigyanik vibhaajan anand kumaar swami ne kiya tha
 He wrote a book called 'rajput Painting' in 1916
 unhone rajput painting main pahari chitrastyli ko bhi shaamil kiya
 But now in practice, under the Rajput style, only Rajasthan's painting is accepted
 vastutah rajasthani chitrakala se taatpary us chitrakala se he, jo is praant kii dharohar he or purv main raajapootaana main prachlit thi
 Rajasthani painting, adorned in various styles and sub-genre, certainly holds an important place in Indian painting
 anya shaileyon se prabhavit hone ke uparant bhi rajasthani chitrakala kii moulik asmita he
 It has its own identity on the basis of characteristics of folk life, sense of sentiment, variety of subject matter, varna diversity, nature, environment, country time etc

 is prakaar in chitron main vishay-vastu evam vaataavaran kaa santulan bana rahata he
 The main shape and background have equal importance
 rajasthani chitrakala main prakruti kaa maanvikaran dekhne ko miltaa he
 Artists do not consider nature to be the root and consider it to be a conscious entity having a negative connection to human happiness and sorrow
 chitra main jo bhav nayak ke man main rahata he, usee ke anuroop prakruti ko bhi pratibimbit kiya gaya he
 The art of medieval Rajasthani painting has become more captivating due to its natural beauty
 mughal darbar kii apeksha rajasthan ke chitrakaaron ko adhik swatantrata thi
 This was the reason that common life and folk beliefs got more expression in Rajasthani painting
