 kendriya mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana bhi antytah pradhanmantri hi karte hai
 However, the Prime Minister cannot do the appointment, expulsion and other such functions of the ministers themselves
 mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana raashtrapati dwaara pradhanmantri ke salaah par hota he
 The Constitution of India respectively promulgates a number of legislations that have legally ensured that in normal circumstances, in the case of the executive, the President should have only nominal powers, while the actual powers are in the hands of the Prime Minister
 samvidhan ne pradhanmantri or raashtrapati kii shaktiyon ko bhaag 5 ke vibhinn anuchhedon main kuch is prakaar ankit kiya gaya he: Generally, the Prime Minister is appointed by the President on the basis of the result of the parliamentary general election
 pradhanmantri, loksabhaa main bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa hote hai
 Although the Prime Minister does not have to be a Lok Sabha MP himself, he has to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha and become a member of Parliament within six months of his appointment
 pradhanmantri sansad ke donon sadanon main se kisi bhi ek sadan ke sadsy ho sakate hai
 Historically, there have been many Prime Ministers who were Rajya sabha-mps; In 1966, Indira Gandhi, Deve Gowda and more recently Manmohan Singh, were Rajya sabha-mps
 prayek chunaav pashchaat, naveen sabha kii baithak main bahumat daal ke netaa ke chunaav ke baad, raashtrapati, bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa ko pradhanmantri banane hetu aamantrit karte hai, aamantran sweekaar karne ke pashchaat, sambandhit vyakti ko loksabhaa main matdaan dwaara vishwasamat praapt karnaa hota he
 Thereafter the order of confidence is passed on to the President, after which the Prime Minister and other ministers are administered the oath of office and they are appointed as Prime Ministers at a ceremony
 yadi koi ek dal yaa gathbandhan, loksabhaa main bahumat praapt karne main aksham hota he, to, yah purnatah mahamahim raashtrapati ke vivek par nirbhar hota he ki ve kis vyakti ko pradhanmantripad praapt karne hetu aamantrit karen
 Such a situation is called a state of hung assembly
 trishanku sabha kii sthiti main raashtrapati saadharantah sabase bade dal ke netaa ko nimnasadan main bahumat siddh karne hetu aamantrit karte he
 It is mandatory for a person who accepts the invitation to prove his trust in the Lok Sabha and only then can that person be appointed Prime Minister
 aitihaasik taur par, is visheshadhikaar kaa prayog anek avasaron par vibhinn raashtrapatigan kar chuke hai
 After the resignation of Prime Minister Morarji Desai by President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy in 1977, Chaudhary Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, exercising this same privilege
 iske alaava bhi is visheshadhikaar kaa upyog kar, raashtrapatigan ne 1989 main rajeev gandhi or vishwanath pratap singh, 1991 main narsingh raav tathaa 1996 or 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ko pradhanmantripad par niyukt karne ke liye kiya he
 The cabinet is made up of ministers selected by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President
 bhartiya samvidhan, pradhanmantri pad hetu kisi prakaar kii vishesh arhataayen nirdisht nahin karata he
 But one need has been fixed: the Prime Minister should have the membership of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and they should have majority support in Lok Sabha
 yadi niyukti ke samay paatr, bhartiya sansad ke do sadanon main se kisi bhi sadan kaa sadsy nahin hota he to niyukti ke 6 maheenon ke madhya hi unhen sansad kii sadsyta praapt karnaa anivaary he anyathaa unka pradhanmantritv khaarij ho jaayegaa
 Therefore, the claimant to the Prime Minister must have all the qualifications to be an MP
 bhartiya samvidhan ke pancham bhaag kaa 84vaan anuchhed, ek saansad kii arhataaon ko nirdisht karata he, uske anusaar: a person shall be qualified to be elected to fill a place in Parliament only when— jaisaa ki tisare bindu main vinirdisht he, paatr ko sansad dwaara bhavishya main paarit paatrata ke kisi bhi yogayata par khara utaarna hoga tathaa kyonki pradhanmantri kaa saansad hona anivaary he, atah pradhanmantritv ke paatr ko loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha kaa sadsy hone yogya hone hetu, kuch anya arhataaon par bhi khara utarana hota he, jinamein uskaa vikrut charitra vaala vyakti yaa diwalia ghoshit naa hona, swechha se kisi videshi rajya kii naagarikta praapt kar lenaa, kisi nyaayalay dwaara uskaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya janaa, tathaa raashtrapati yaa rajyapal niyukt hona shaamil hai
 Also, an eligible person should not be an employee of any beneficial post in the service of any office and administrative or non-administrative body under the Central Government, any State Government or any of the aforesaid Government
 saath hi sadan se prastaav-sweekrut nishkasana se bhi paatr kii sadsyta samaapt ho jaati he
 After the appointment, the Prime Minister's disqualification, on any of the foregoing qualifications, is proved in a legal court, then the election of that person is declared void, and he is expelled from the post of Prime Minister
 
 pradhanmantri ko pad kii shapath raashtrapati dwaara dilaai jaati he
 For appointment to the post, the prospective officer is required to take two oaths
 ye donon shapath bhartiya samvidhan kii teesri anusuchee main vinirdisht hai, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 or 219): Types of Pledge or Affirmation: 1 mantripad kii shapath kaa praaroop : 2 Form of Oath of Privacy: saiddhanthik rupatah, padasth pradhanmantri, "raashtrapati ke prasadparyant", apane pad par bana rahata he
 Unlike the President, no time limit has been set for the Prime Minister's term
 atah ek padasth pradhanmantri anishchit kaal tak pradhanmantripad par bana rah saktaa he, basharte ki raashtrapati ko usapar "vishwaas" ho
 The real meaning of this is that a person can hold the post of Prime Minister only as long as the majority in the Lok Sabha is in his favor
 baharhaal, loksabhaa kaa puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh hota he, jiske baad nae chunaav karaaye jate hai, or naveen sabha punah pradhanmantri ke paksh main vishwasamat paarit karti he, yadi nav-nirvaachit sabha pradhanmantri main avishvaas ghoshit kar detii he to phir pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it can be said that the Prime Minister has a full term of 5 years, after which he is reviewed again
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon se purv hi samaapt ho saktaa he, yadi kisi karanvash, loksabhaa sarkaar ke virodh main avishvaas mat paarit kare athwa yadi kisi karanvash, pradhanmantri kii sansad kii sadsyta shunaya ghoshit ho jaae to pradhanmantri, kisi bhi samay, apane pad kaa tyaag, raashtrapati ko ek likhit tyaagptr saunp ke kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister of the country to relinquish his office during his tenure
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal par naa hi kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa he naa koi aayu seemaa nirdisht kii gai he
 India Gateway bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti aavashyak maanata he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah akele hi mantri parishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he
 All policy decisions are taken by him
 raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhyasampark sutara bhi vahi he
 He is also the principal spokesman of the Council of Ministers
 vah parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he
 He can participate in any debate being fought in favor of the Council in Parliament
 mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he
 He can ask for any information from any ministry
 in sab karnow ke chalate pradhanmantri ko bharat kaa sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik vyaktitv mana jaataa he
 The most important reason for the dominance and importance of the Indian Prime Minister is the executive powers conferred on his office bearers
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 74 pradhanmantri ke pad ko sthapit karata he, evam yah nirdisht karata he ki ek mantriparishad hogi jiskaa mukhiya pradhanmantri hoga, jo bharat ke raashtrapati ko "salaah or sahaayta" pradaan karenge
 And Article 75 establishes that the appointment of ministers will be done by the President as per the advice of the Prime Minister, and the minister will also be given various assignments as per the advice of the President, Prime Minister
 atah samvidhan yah nirdisht karata he kii, jahaan sanvaidhanik kaaryakari adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ke paas he, parantu kyonki in sambandhon main bharat ke raashtrapati keval pradhanmantri kii salaahnusaar kaary karte hai, atah vaastavik rup se, in kaaryakari adhikaron kaa prayog pradhanmantri apni icchaanusaar karte hai
 The constitution establishes by these legislations that as the head of the nation of India, the Prime Minister shall exercise all the executive powers vested indirectly, and will be the head of the entire Council of Ministers and constitution of the Council of Ministers by Article 75, appointment of ministers
 And his assignment has also been left to the will of the Prime Minister, but also the ministers and ministers
 The Constitution, the Prime Minister in relation to schools provides complete freedom
 pradhanmantri, apane mantrimandal main kisi bhi vyakti ko shaamil kar sakate he, nikaal sakate he, niyukt kar sakate hai yaa nilambit karvaa sakate hai
 Since ministers are appointed by the President only on the advice of the Prime Minister, it means that the Council of Ministers is actually created by people of the Prime Minister's choice, in which they can change at any time of their choice
 saath hi mantriyon ko vibhinn kaarybhaar pradaan karnaa bhi purnatah pradhanmantri kii ichha par nirbhar karata he; ve apane mantriyon main se kisi ko bhi koi bhi mantralay yaa kaarybhaar saunp sakati hai, chin sakate hai yaa doosraa koi kaarybhaar / mantralay saunp sakate hai
 In these cases there is no constitutional obligation of any kind to the Prime Minister to consult the ministers concerned, or to obtain their permission

 After Singh's resignation, his former partner, Chandrasekhar, formed the Samajwadi Janata Party with 64 mps and, with the support of the Congress, proved a majority in the Lok Sabha
 parantu unka pradhanmantri kaal adhik samay tak tik nahin sakaa
 Due to withdrawal of Congress support, in November 1991, Chandrasekhar's term ended less than a year, and new elections were declared

 Narasimha Rao's tenure was a time of decisive and historical change for the Indian economy
 apane vittamantri, manmohan singh ke zariye, narsingh raav ne bhartiya arthvyavastha kii udaarikaran kii shuruyaat kii, jiske kaaran, bharat kii abtak sust padi, khataron se juujhati arthvyavastha ko puri tarah badal diya
 These liberalization decisions transformed India from a firmly controlled, agro-industry mixed economy to a market-determined economy
 in aarthik nitiyon ko, aagaamee sarkaron ne jari rakhaa, or bhartiya arthvyavastha ko vishwa kii sabase gatisheel arthvyavasthaaon main se ek banaaya
 Apart from these economic changes, Narasimha Rao's tenure also saw the demolition of the disputed structure of Ayodhya's Babri masjid-ramjanmabhoomi and the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party as a national level party

 The government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, elected in 1998, took some very concrete and challenging steps
 may 1998 main sarkaar ke gathan ke ek maheene ke baad, sarkaar ne pokharan main paanch bhutalia parmaanu visphot karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Many Western countries, including the US, imposed economic sanctions on India in protest of these blasts, but due to the support of Russia, France, Gulf countries and some others, this ban of Western countries completely failed
 is aarthik pratibandh kii paristhiti ko bakhubi sanbhaalane ko atal sarkaar kii behtareen kootnithik jeet ke rup main dekha gaya
 a few months later, Pakistan also conducted a nuclear test in response to the Indian nuclear test
 donon deshon ke bich bigadate halaaton ko dekhte hue, sarkaar ne rishte behatar karne kii koshish kii
 In February 1999, the two countries signed the Lahore Declaration, declaring both countries to end mutual rivalries, increase trade and use their nuclear capability for peaceful purposes
 17 april 1999 ko jayalalita kii party iedamak ne sarkaar se apana samarthan he diya, or nae chunaavon kii ghoshnaa kerani padi
 And the Atal government was reduced to the level of periodic governance until elections

 This action was successful and within about 2 months, the Indian Saina conquered Pakistan

 However, during his reign, in 2002, the hindu-muslim riots that followed the Godhra carnage in Gujarat incited India's most violent and painful community riots in post-independence India, especially in Gujarat and many other parts of the country
 sarkaar par or gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri, narendra modi, par us samay, dango ke dauraan roak-tham ke uchit kadam nahin uthaane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 Prime Minister Vajpayee's term ended in May 2004
 ve desh ke pehle aise gair-congressi pradhanmantri the, jinhone apana puure paanch varshon kaa kaarykaal purna kiya tha
 In the 2004 elections, the National Democratic Alliance was unable to get a majority in the Lok Sabha, and the Congress emerged as the single largest party in the House

 During his tenure, the country maintained the economic momentum achieved during Prime Minister Vajpayee
 iske alaava, sarkaar ne aadhaar or soochna adhikaar jaisi suvidhaayen paarit kii
 In addition, Manmohan Singh's tenure faced a number of strategic and security-related challenges
 26 november 2008 ko mumbai par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke baad, desh main kai suraksha sudhaar karyanvit kiye gaye
 At the end of his first term with the US, on the issue of the civil nuclear deal, the government had almost collapsed with the Left Front's withdrawal of support, but the government was able to prove a majority
 2009 ke chunaav main congress or bhi majboot janadesh ke saath sadan main ai or pradhanmantri manmohan singh pradhanmantri ke aasaan par vidyaman rahe
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's second term was surrounded by a number of high-level scams and allegations of corruption

 An uninterrupted power supply or UPS is a device that ensures an adequate supply of power to a power-operated device for a limited time even when power supply is not available from the main source of supply
 upies kai prakaar ke banaaye jate hai or simit samay ke liye aapurti uplabdh karaane ke alaava ye kuch or bhi kaam kar sakate hai - jaise voltata-niyantran, aavriti-niyantran, shakti gunank vardhan evam uski gunvattta ko behatar karke upkaran ko dena, aadi
 UPS has one means of energy storage, such as a battery, a fast-moving flywheel, a charged capacitor or an excessive current flowing in a superconducting coil
 upies, sahaayak urja-strot jaise- stand-bai janarator aadi se is maamle main bhinn hai ki vidyut jane par ve sambandhit upkaran ko milane vaali vidyut main naganya samay ke liye vyavdhaan karte hai jisase us upkaran ke kaam main baadha yaa rukawat nahin aati
 UPS is often used with computers, data centers, communication devices, etc
 where an accident can occur due to power outages; Fear of destroying important figures; There may be loss of business etc
 upies na sirf computer ko voltage kam-zyada hone kii sthiti main haani se bachaata he, balki vidyut aapurti chale jane kii sthiti main kuch samay baad tak computer ko vidyut pradaan karata he, jisase upayokta apana kiya hua kaam sahej lete hai or computer ko sahi tareeke se shat down kar pate hai
 If the power supply of the computer goes away or becomes unstable, then it is likely to damage the hard drive and RAM and the motherboard can also be in danger
 upies main voltata niyantran bhi avashya hona chaiye, jisase upies is khatre se computer ko bachaa paye
 It should be noted that UPS should not be overloaded with external devices like installing unnecessary printers, scanners and fax machines etc
 kabhi bhi printer ko bydaree back ap system main plag na karen
 Similarly, UPS can be either offline type or line-interactive type

 Not only this, such upss are of small size and are available with most producers
 online upies upies tulanaatmak rup se mahange hote hai
 In this design, the battery is charged through the inverter
 chunki asi line se sidhaa judaav nahin hota, isse line main koi gadabadi hone kaa asar upies par nahin padataa
 If using computers at home, then comparatively cheap standby power system should be used for this
 upies kai tarah ke hote hai
 According to a classification, they can be static or rotational
 jin upies main koi ghoomane vaali mashin prayog nahin kii jaati balki keval sthavar ardhchaalak yuktiyaan prayog kii jaatin hai use sthitik upies kehete hai
 In contrast, rotary machines that use rotary UPS are called rotary UPS
 the The power capacity of UPS should be high
 adhik upies is tarah dizin kiye jate hai ki vidyut jane ke 10 minute baad tak unase jude upkaran kaam kar sakate hai
 For this, V

 Ratings have to be kept in mind

 Section 14 of the Indian Contracts of Work, 1872 defines consent as free
 "consent-consent" is said to be free when it is not by reason maan lijie agar ek karmchaaree patr prastaav diya jaataa he ek or vah ise sweekaar karata he
 Once she meets, if the employer asks her to sign up for 1 lakh rupees if a bond continues in employment, then the court effect could be seen as an unfair one after the employee is past her job and she resigns There is no other option but to agree to the terms and conditions of the employer
 So a lot of these things depends on the circumstances of the case and the facts
 ek rojgaar anubandh yaa nahin he kii tarah ek maanak anubandh he, jahaan prastaav karmchaaree saktaa he yaa to sweekaar karte hai
 Unless an employee proves that the employment bond is obtained without his free consent, the conditions provided by the bond can be enforced and are not contrary to the proper public policy
 Whether the law is fair depends on the ability of lawyers to argue another case
 bhartiya anubandh adhyay VI adhinium, 1872 anubandh ke ulanghan ke liye uplabdh upachaar ke bare main charchaa karata he
 The case of compensation for breach of contract is one of every act to be dealt with on an s basis of 73 years
 74 a special case where the contract for payment of an amount of money on breach of contract includes any other condition for the contract itself or the penalty shall also be applied in addition to the principle propounded by s and that even if why The amount of the stipulated in the contract, the aggrieved party entitled to in the contract only fixed reasonable compensation to which would be, but not exceeding such amount
 No one is involved in a contract regardless of whether the clause is a contract
 It has been decided which one is whether the sum or the money is being paid as a breach of contract, the party complaining of the breach of contract damages
 Can not successfully claim compensation unless it makes out of damages to be referable like breach
 Proper compensation would be the best measure of the extent to which the damage or loss of continuous course is actual
 If the actual extent of the loss or damage is sustained, reasonable compensation is being able to determine the amount of proved that the Court provides a safe guidance for
 agar nuksaan yaa maatra kaa tehraav kii haani sambhav nahin he, party he jo ulanghan ke kaaran kaa saamana karnaa padaa upaay bina nahin he
 He can still request the court to assess the appropriate compensation for the award itself and on the material available
 The words in S
 74 emphasize that in a case where the actual loss or proof of limitation is incapable or not 'loss or damage to prove whether or not the actual cause has been caused' is also taxed for employment Can be given reasonable compensation
 This is the reason why s 74 of the Act is said to have been deliberately awarded to be properly compensated
 nuksaan main ek maamle main jahaan ke ulanghan kii shikaayat party yaa haani kii bhaavana banaae rakhane kii chot main kanoonee anubandh he nahin padaa he, vahaan ke liye use kuch bhi nahin he kshatipurti karne ke liye, vahaan sudhaar karnaa he kuch bhi nahin badla he, yaa santusht
 isliye, vah muaavje ke hakdaar hone ke liye nahin kiya jayega
 By reading the sections mentioned above it is very clear that the employer assumes that if a bond ends on an agreement with the employer before the term of an employee is specified and there is an amount to be paid to determine the contract
 For, the employer can sue for breach, ask for employee contract and set the amount
 agar nirdhaarit raashi sampada he ek anumaan ke-vaastavik purv haani to kaha jaataa he ise nasht harjaana lekin agar main nirdisht raashi rojgaar anubandh kii tarah he ek khatre ke pradarshan karne ke liye majaboor kiya jahaan karmchaaree anubandh he, to yah ek dand 
 If the court finds that this award is a penalty then it will only be an amount which will suffer the employer to compensate the real loss
 For example if it is paid a contract specifying an amount of 1 crore of employment, if it is cross, then the court will consider it as a penalty and will only award the actual loss that costs training employer
 v
 E
 Eswarprasad & Ors
 a contracted employee who was engaged in the dissolution as an engineer committed to serve as sales only for 14 months after that undertaking when the plaintiff left the services for three years
 It was held in this case that it becomes unnecessary to dissolve any damages for proving any separate post-employer
 And others, The training on that would be sufficient or proven for the fact that the concession side or the particular employee was related to the cost of the beneficiary and the employer expenses in full or in part and there was a violation by the beneficiary undertaking
 In such cases, the breach would result from the formation of per se, by breach or violation of the required legal employer employees
 The High Court also clarified that as long as the granting of compensation is determined, there will be no effect on the amount of loss of the statutory exception

 At the same time companies get on board and try to make the contract put negative to the covenants
 Some employers are imposing conditions such as, at the end of the contract, the employee should not work with competitors to take over
 This 1872 Act contract is not valid according to the Indian Section 27

 The hiv-1m group virus prevails and is responsible for AIDS
 anuvanshik anukram byore ke hisaab se group em or kai roopon main ubvibhajit ho saktaa he
 Some of the subtypes are more virulent or resistant to different drugs
 isi tarah, echivi - 2 virus kam ugr or echivi -1 kam sankramak mana gaya he, haalanki 2 echivi 2 bhi aids kaa kaaran mana gaya he
 HIV-1 virus is the commonest and most pathogenic

 Transmission of power from the generator to the user site is called transmission
 adhikansh sthanon main vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan uske upyogsthalon se dur hota he
 While the transmission of electric power from the generator to the user site is called transmission, the practical meaning of the term is often related to distance and high bolt
 preshan line pole athwa minaaron par aropit, upree linon ke rup main bhi tathaa bhumigat cabilon ke rup main bhi hoti hai
 The upper lines are usually made of copper wire, but aluminum and steel and aluminum composite conductors are also widely used
 adhikansh sthanon main vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan uske upyogsthalon se dur hota he
 Public places are established, in fact, on the basis of achievement of means and economic justification
 jalavidyutgharon ko kisi vishisht sthaan par bana dene kaa prashn hi nahin uthta, kyoki unka sthaan to prakritik sadhano par nirbhar karata he jo saadharantaya ghani aabaadeewale kshetron se dur hote hai
 The installation of thermal power stations also depends on the achievement of the coal as well as the problem of transportation and its transportation
 at: bahudhaa janitrasthalon kii duuri bhaar se kai sau mile bhi ho sakati he or aisi dashaon main preshan linon dwaara shakti ko bhaar tak pahunchaana hota he
 Therefore, remittance is as much an important and important part of the power industry as is the production of power itself
 vaise to janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak vidyutsakti ko le janaa hi preshan kehalaata he, parantu is shabd kaa vyaavhaarik arth bahudhaa duuri tathaa ucch boltata se sambandhit he
 The transmission lines are superimposed on poles or minarets, also as overhead lines and also as underground cables
 upree line saadharantaya taanbe ke taar kii hoti hai, parantu aluminium tathaa ispaat or aluminium ke sanyukt chaalak bhi vistrut rup se prayukt kiye jate hai
 The upper lines should be at least 20 feet above the ground level and no part of it should be at a lower elevation
 bhoomi se inaki oonchaai, ucch voltata kii dasha main or bhi adhik hoti he
 Therefore these lines are carried on the poles and charged on the insulators of the porcelain
 adhik shakti preshan karanevaale, mote chaalkon kii line pole ke sthaan par badi badi minaaron par le jaai jaati hai, jo chaalak sankhya tathaa unpar laganevaale balon ke anusaar vibhinn akruti kii bani hoti he
 The insulators are also of different types and mainly belong to different classes according to their position and voltage
 is prakaar vidyutarodhi 440 volt kii alp voltata se lekar 11 kilovolt, 33 kilovolt, 66 kilovolt ityadi virgon ke hote hai or sthiti ke anusaar vidyutarodhi shaikal, pin, discs tathaa nilamban praroop ke hote hai, jo vibhinn sthitiyon main prayukt kiye jate hai
 The insulators are usually mounted on the pole with scissors and are configured so that in any case the driver does not touch the swinging, the other driver, or the pole, or any of its structural components
 inaki akruti evam rachana bhi is prakaar kii hoti he ki kisi bhi paristhiti main chaalak tathaa pole ke kisi sanrachana anshak ke bich chaalak kaa sandhaaran kar saken
 Cables can be called, in fact, any insulating conductor, but the cables used for the transmission of power are mainly used underground
 at: cabilon kii rachana bhi aisi hoti he ki ve bhoomi ke andar padanevaale prabhaavon se surakshit rah saken
 Generally, the transmission cables are triangular
 at: uname kam se kam teen crode haate hai, jo alag-alag vidyut-ruddha haate hai or phir upar se bhi unpar doosraa vidyutrodhi lapet diya jaataa he
 It is insulated, usually, of diluted paper, or cotton tape, depending on the square of the working voltage of the cable
 vidyutrodhi kharaab na ho jaae, isliye chaalak crode tathaa achaalak sise kii nalee main, jo nami ko andar nahin jane detii, samaavruth hote hai
 This tube is provided with jute lace to protect it from mechanical damage and an iron leaf shield is provided from above
 is kaaran inhen kavchit cabile bhi kehete hai
 Very high voltage transmission cables are also filled with oil
 tel, vastut:, uttam achaalak madhyam he
 But the design of such cables is quite complex and difficult to take care of
 iske kaaran inkaa upyog simit he
 The austerity of electrification depends to a large extent on the size of the conductor
 chaalak kaa aakaar mukhyat: vahan kii janevaali dhara par nirbhar karata he
 The current to be carried for a given power depends mainly on the voltage
 at: preshan ke liye ucchtam voltata prayog karnaa hi upyukt he, jisase us shakti ke liye vahan kii janevaali dhara kam ho sake or chote aakaar ke chaalak prayukt kiye ja saken
 But even the highest voltage has its limits
 36 kilometre se adhik volttaaon par chaalak kaa aakaar dhara ke pariman par hi nahin, vastut:, korana ke prabhaav par nirbhar karata he
 The corona has the effect of expelling the air around the conductor at high voltages
 iske kaaran him him kii dhwani tathaa chamak utpann hoti he or yah antat: shakti haani ke rup main prakat hoti he
 For this reason, the shape of the driver has to be designed keeping this power loss and its effects in view
 ucchtam volttaaon par preshan linon kaa sanchaar linon se vyatikaran duusari mahatvapurn samasya he
 High voltage transmitting lines cause an interference voltage in the adjacent communication lines, causing communication disturbances, but this interference can be minimized by keeping the communication lines away from the power lines, and many other treatments
 Can be done
 teesri kathinaayee ucch voltata achaalkon tathaa minaaron kii uchit sanrachana kii he, jisase doshi sthitiyaan utpann na ho saken
 At the same time their proper care also becomes a problem
 inke atirikt ucchtam volttaaon par shakti sthayitv mahatvapurn samasya he
 In long lines of very high voltages, power flow is, in effect, limited by power stability
 is kaaran nirdhaarit shakti keval kisi vishisht voltata par vishisht duuri tak hi preshit kii ja sakati he
 Also, the transmission can be the most economical at a specific voltage according to the transmitted power and distance
 ye samasyaayen badi badi yojanaon main bahut mahatvapurn hoti he or preshnatantr kaa abhikalp yojana kaa ek mukhya ang hota he
 The basis of the dispatch system is the weighting survey
 sabase pehle vibhinn sthanon main prastaavit bhaar kaa pariklan kar liya jaataa he or tab unke anusaar upakendron kii sthiti nishchit kii jaati he
 According to the load and distance, the voltage of the transmission and the number of circuits are determined and the path of the proposed lines is determined
 line abhikalp ke praroop evam abhikalp, vidyutrodhiyon kaa praroop or unako lagane kaa yantravinyas tathaa sangrakshantantr kisi bhi yojana ke liye aarthik pahalu sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 Successful design of a remittance system is also the most important economic aspect
 preshnatantr kaa safal abhikalp bhi aarthik kasuti par nirbhar karata he
 There are three main components of transmission of a specified power: power, distance and voltage
 kisi bhi preshnatantr kii yojana kaa safal abhikalp in teenon sanghatakon ke upyukt samanvay par nirbhar karata he
 Significant research is being done in the direction of line design, as a result of which the level of electrical resistance is no longer as high as it was 10 years ago
 is prakaar linon ke mulya main baari bachat sambhav ho saki he
 Very high voltages are dispatched, usually for a distance of more than 100 miles
 bahudhaa preshan ke do kramon main karnaa padataa he
 Transmission at very high voltages is usually done from the power station's sub-center to the sub-stations near the center across the utility area, from where the power tax is transmitted to the sub-station of the utility at a medium voltage
 is prakaar ise praathmik evam dwitiyak preshan ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Distributor or feeding lines are carried from the last sub-station to the load, from where individual loads are handled
 saadharantaya janit voltata ko preshan karne ke liye ati ucch volttaaon main roopatarit karnaa hota he
 Consequently, they are also important parts of the dispatch system
 inke saath hi bahut se sangrakshan yuktiyaan tathaa paripath trotak bhi tantra kaa vishisht anshak hai
 The oil circuit trot is arranged on either side of the transformer, so that the circuit on either side of the transformer can be opened
 isi prakaar kisi line athwa uske prabhag ko niskriy kar sakane kaa praavdhaan hota he, jisase dosha kii sthiti main line kii manramat kii ja sake
 In fact, conservation tips automatically open and separate the guilty division in the event of a defect
 line sangrakshan ke liye upakentre main bahut prakaar ke riley prayukt kiye jate hai
 Common relays settled are overload relays and ground erosion relays
 atibhaar riley, atibhaar kii avasthaa main, paripath trotak kaa pravartit kar paripath ko khol dete hai or is prakaar line tathaa usase sambandhit saajasja ko atibhaar se honevaali kshati athwa hanikaarak prabhaavon se bachaate hai
 The soil erosion relays operate in a state of land degradation and connect the culprit line
 or bhi bahut se bhinn bhinn prakaar ke riley prayukt kiye jate hai
 Many relays operate depending on the distance of the fault and many use a pilot wire, however the latest protection mechanism is the carrier protection system
 karier, vastut:, ek ucch aavriti kii tarang ko kehete hai, jo pilot taron par shakti aavriti ke saath hi adhyaropit kar di jaati he
 In the event of a fault, the relay connected to it disengages the line, acting immediately
 karier sangrakshan tantra duusare tantron kii apeksha adhik drutagami he or adhik vishwasaneey bhi he
 But this can only be economically appropriate for high voltage lines
 preshan linon ke abhikalp main tadit sangrakshan kaa praavdhaan karnaa bhi atyant mahatvapurn hota he
 Falling on a lightning line can destroy it and all the equipment attached to it
 isse bachaav ke liye bahut si yuktiyaan prayukt kii jaati he, jinamein mukhyat: bhoomi taar tathaa taditnirodhak kaa praavdhaan he
 The ground wire normally protects the line from the harmful effects of lightning and prevents lightning from falling as far as possible on the line
 taditnirodhak upakentre athwa ant sanrachanaon par lagaae jate hai or tadit ke line par gir jane par us sidhe hi bhooyojit kar dete hai, jisase line athwa saajasja ko kshati nahin pahunchne paati
 All the minarets are properly grounded and their earth resistance is kept very low by making various arrangements
 taditsangrakshan ke drushtikon se adhik varg ke achaalkon kaa bhi prayog karnaa padataa he, parantu aajkal taditnirodhak par shodh ke falswaroop achaalak kaa str unchaa rakhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 Remittances are often interlinked as grids, allowing the free flow of power within the grid
 aise grid ati ucch volttaaon par kaary karte hai or sampurna tantra kii voltata tathaa aavriti ek hi hoti he
 The difficulties of control are certainly increased, but the surplus power of any place in the system can be used in other places, where it is needed
 is prakaar bijligharon main atirikt sthapit shakti kaa rakhana aavashyak nahin rah jaataa
 In fact, in large grids, the power of a single power plant, or machine, is negligible compared to the power of the entire system and does not specifically affect the functioning of the entire system
 bharat main bhi aise bahut se grid hai, jaise bhakhda grid, ganga jalavidyut grid, sharada grid, di

 athwa isse bhi unchi voltata par kaary karegi
 Almost all the power transmission is on the alternating current due to the convenience of conversion by transformers from low voltage to high voltage and high to low voltage
 parantu haal main hi is vichaardhaara main ek gahan parivartan aa rahaa he or ati ucch volttaaon par disht dhara preshan vyaavhaarik tathaa pravidhik donon roopon se adhik upyukt samajha jane laga he
 In such a system, both reproduction and consumption is the norm

 India has a rich tradition of music since prehistoric times

 But gradually the three songs, instruments and dances became entrenched in the "music" - songs, instruments and dances in the trinity
 bharat se baahar anya deshon main keval geet or vaadya ko sangeet main ginate hai; nrity ko ek bhinn kala maanate hai
 In India also, dance is counted in music only because it is accompanied by an equal song or instrument or both
 ham upar kah chuke hai ki swar or lay kii kala ko sangeet kehete hai
 Vowel and rhythm are found in both song and instrument, but in dance there is only rhythm, not tone

 But nutritional evidence of this fantasy has not been found yet

 This is the square root
 Most methods of deriving the square root of positive numbers s begin with an approximate value of the square root that is progressively made pure
 yadi yah aarmabhik maan, vargamul ke shuddh maan se bahut dur hoga to gananaa karne main adhik charan lagenge
 Therefore it is very useful to approximate the square root
