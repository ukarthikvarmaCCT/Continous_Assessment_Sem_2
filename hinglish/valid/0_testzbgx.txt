 During this period, the tradition of writing had developed into grave autobiography, such as that of Harkhuf and Veni
 The style known as Sebayat was developed to propagate the preaching and guidance of famous nobles; Ipuvre Papyrus, a poem of lamentations describing natural disaster and social revolution, is a well-known example

 sant gyaneshwar maharashtra terahavin sadi ke ek mahaan sant the jinhone gyaneshwari kii rachana kii
 Saint Dnyaneshwar is counted among the great saints and Marathi poets of India
 ye sant namdev ke samakaleen the or unke saath inhone puure maharashtra kaa bhraman kar logon ko gyaan-bhakthi se parichit karaayaa or samta, sambhaav kaa upadesh diya
 They are also considered among the 'proto-promoters' of Maharashtra culture
 sant gyaneshwar kaa janm san 1275 isvi main maharashtra ke aurangabad jile main paithan ke paas godavari nadi ke kinare aapegaanv main bhadrapada ke krishna paksh kii ashtami ko hua tha
 His father's name was Vitthal Pant and mother's name was Rukmini Bai
 inke pita ucch koti ke mumukshu tathaa bhagavan vitthalanath ke anany upaask the
 After marriage, he took renunciation initiation, but he had to enter the householder's labor again with the permission of his Gurudev
 is avasthaa main unhen nivrittinath, gyandev tathaa sopan naamak teen putr evam muktabai naam kii ek kanya hui
 Due to the birth of these children after renunciation, initiation, they had to endure this derogatory address 'children of ascetics'
 vitthal pant ko to us samay ke samaaj dwaara di gai ajna ke anusaar dehtyag tak karnaa padaa tha
 The orphaned brothers and sisters, who were deprived of the umbrella of their father, went to the well-known Dharmakshetra reading of that time to receive the 'shuddhipatra', under the harsh trauma of Janapism
 kimvadanti prasiddh he : gyandev ne yahan unka uphaas uda rahe brahmanon ke samaksh bhainse ke mukh se vedoccharan karaayaa tha
 According to his biography published by Geetapress, Gorakhpur - " xxrep 5 
 was to go to welcome 1400 year old ascetic Changdev, at that time these walls were sitting, he drove the same wall to the said saint
 " marathi geet main yah ghatana yon gaai jaati rahi he-"chalavili jad bhinti
 Haravili Changayachi Misconception
 " inke is alokik chamatkaar se prabhavit ho paithan ke pramukh vidwaanon ne un chaaron bhai bahanon ko shaq samvath 1209 main 'shuddhipatr' pradaan kar diya
 With the said Corrigendum, all four reached the village of Nevasse, situated on the banks of the river Pravara
 gyandev ke jyeshtha bhrata nivrittinath ke nath sampradaay ke gahaninath se upadesh mila tha
 He conveyed that spiritual heritage to his younger sister Muktabai through Jnanadev
 is prakaar parmarthamarg main krutharth evam saamaajik drushti se punit gyandev ne aabalavridhon ko aadhyatm kaa saral parichay praapt karaane ke uddeshy se shrimadbhagavadgita par marathi main tikaa likhi
 The name of this is Bhavarthadeepika or Dnyaneshwari
 is granth kii purnataa shaq samvath 1212 nevaase gaanv ke mahalay devi ke mandir main hui
 Some scholars are of the opinion - He also wrote a Marathi commentary on the Abhinav circle, but Yogavasistha, but unfortunately it is inaccessible
 un dinon ke lagbhag saare dharmagranth sanskrit main hote the or aam janata bahut sanskrit nahin jaanati thi, astu tejasvi balak gyaneshwar ne keval 15 varsh kii umr main hi gita par marathi kii bolchaal bhashaa main 'gyaneshwari'naamak gita-bhashya kii rachana karke marathi janata kii unki apni bhashaa main upadesh kar jaise gyaan kii jholii hi khol di
 The commentator himself has written - "now if i have a proper discussion of the Gita in Marathi language, then what is the reason for this wonder 


 Is there nothing possible with guru-kripa?" is granth kii samaapti ke uparaant gyaneshwar ne apane raajnneetik siddhanton kii swatantra vivechna karanevaale 'amritanubhav' naamak duusare granth kaa nirmaan kiya
 After the completion of this book, these four brothers and sisters reached the nearby village of Alandi in Pune
 yahan se inhone yogiraj changdev ko 65 oviyon main jo patr likhaa vah maharashtra main 'changdev pasashthi' naam se vikhyath he
 When Gyanadev left Alandi for the purpose of pilgrimage, he was accompanied by his brothers, sisters, grandmother, and many contemporary saints like Visova Khecher, Gora Kumhar etc
 visheshtya namdev tathaa gyandev ke aapasi sambandh itane snehpurn the ki aisa lagata tha maano is tirthayatra ke bahaane gyaan or karm donon tapasviyon ke bhes main saakaar rup dhaaran kar ekarup ho gaye hon
 Returning from the pilgrimage, Gyan Dev reached Alandi by Pandharpur route
 vidwaanon kaa anumaan hai ki gyandev ne isi kaal main apane 'abhangon' kii rachana kii hogi
 After re-establishing the bhagavata-dharma by introducing the Bhakti Marg from the child to the elderly, Gyan Dev decided to take a living samadhi in Alandi village, despite being very young
 maatr 21 varsh teen maah or paanch din kii alpaayu main vah is nashwar sansar kaa parityag kar samadhisth ho gayi
 Saint Namdev has written the account of Gyandev's tomb
 apane guru nivrittinath ko antim vandan kar gyandev sthitprajna ke samaan samadhimandir main ja baithe
 Thereafter, the Guru himself closed the gateway to the Samadhimandir
 gyaneshwar, jinhen dhyaneshwar bhi kaha jaataa he, ne yah jivit samadhi gram aalindi samvath main shake 1217 kii margshirsh vadi triyodashi ko lee, jo pune ke lagbhag 14 kilometre dur ab ek prasiddh tirth ban gaya he
 Many works like 'dnyaneshwari', 'amritanubhav', 'changdev Pasathi' and 'abhang' written by Dnyaneshwar are well accepted
 kuch varsh purv yah siddhant upasthit kiya gaya tha ki gyaneshwari ke lekhak tathaa abhang ke rachayita, ek hi naam ke do bhinn vyakti hai
 But now it has been accepted by refuting this principle from many firm grounds that these creations are only of the person Saint Dnyaneshwar / Dhyaneshwar
 apane abhangon main gyaneshwar ne tatvacharchaa kii gaharaaiyon ko na napate hue adhikaar vaani se saadhaaran janata ko achardharm kii shiksha di he
 The result was that this disregard was completely reflected in the minds of children from old to old
 gurukrupa, namsmaran or satsang ye parmarthpath kii teen seedhiyaan hai, jinka digdarshan sant gyaneshwar ne apni shikshaaon main multah karaayaa he
 Jnanadev was a great saint likewise he was also a great poet
 unki aadhyatmik sadhana kavyras se aplavit he, unki kavita ko darshan kii guru-gambhirtha mili he
 It is true that due to the disguise of Dnyaneshwar being like 'you-past', there have been visions of rasa-sources in it, however, his knowledge has been completed in Dnyaneshwari itself
 kavy ke donon angon, ras or alankaar kaa gyaneshwari main sundar samanvay he
 Like Dyanvichar and Kavyasoundarya, all the works that Dnyaneshwar did in the traditional life of Maharashtra were revolutionary
 un dinon karmkand kaa bolbalaa tha, samaaj kaa netritv karanevaali panditon kii parampara prabhaavaheen ho chuki thi
 In such a state, while establishing the importance of spiritual knowledge, Gyandev gave the assessment of devotional path of the common man
 panditon ke granthon tak simit rahanevaala aadhyatm darshan shudradikon ke liye bhi sahaj sulabh ho, ise dhyaan main rakhte hue' gyaneshwari' kii rachana kii gai
 Due to being born in a clan considered 'low', no matter how 'low' a person is considered socially, but God gives equal shelter to everyone, the credit for rendering this theory is to Dnyaneshwar
 maharashtra main inke granth gyaneshwari ko 'mouli' yaa mata bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the second sermon and assurance, at that time only a generation of Bhagavadhaktas were created in all the castes of Maharashtra and Marathi sentimental male and female started singing the glory of Lord Pandurang or Vitthal of Pandharpur in their own language
 bhagavan keval kathor nyaayadhish hi nahin, apitu sahajvatsal pita bhi hai
 He has compassion for a mother in his eyes - Dnyaneshwar told this in his simple-sweet language all over Maharashtra
 isi kaaran yahan punah ek baar bhagwat dharm kii sthapana hui tathaa is sampradaay ke pramukh dharmagranth ke rup main 'gyaneshwari' kii bhi samaanyajan ke bich pratishtha hui
 Due to this, many Bhagwat poets composed books in Marathi language and created a rich poetry tradition on the path of devotion, which is why Jnanadev became the proto-promoter of Maharashtra culture

 In the third question, after representing the origin and condition of Prana, Pippalad has said that according to the determination of a human being in death, life itself takes him to different worlds

 This was a period known as the Golden Age of India, during the empire of Buddhagupta and some younger kings prior to Vishnugupta, the invasion of the Huns in the North East had begun
 aryabhat apni khagoleey pranaaliyon ke liye sandarbh ke rup main srilanka kaa upyog karte the or aryabhatiy main anek avasaron par srilanka kaa ullekh kiya he
 Information of three texts composed by Aryabhata is still available today
 dashagitika, aryabhatiy or tantra
 But according to experts, he wrote another treatise - 'aryabhata Siddhanta'
 is samay uske keval 34 shloke hi uplabdh hai
 His treatise was widely used in the seventh century
 lekin itnaa upyogi granth lupt kaise ho gaya is vishay main koi nishchit jaankaree nahin milti
 He wrote an important astrological treatise called Aryabhatiya, which describes square root, cube root, parallel series and different types of equations
 unhone apane aryabhatiy naamak granth main kul 3 prishthon ke samaa sakane vaale 33 shlokon main ganitvishyak siddhanth tathaa 5 prishthon main 75 shlokon main khagol-vigyaan vishyak siddhanth tathaa iske liye yantron kaa bhi nirupan kiya
 Aryabhata presented revolutionary concepts in his short book for the principles of his predecessor and later countries as well as abroad
 unki pramukh kriti, aryabhatiy, ganit or khagol vigyaan kaa ek sangrah he, jise bhartiya ganitiya sahitya main bade paimaane par uddhrut kiya gaya he or jo aadhunik samay main bhi astitv main he
 The mathematical part of Aryabhatiya includes arithmetic, algebra, simple trigonometry and spherical trigonometry
 isame satat bhinn, dwighat sameekaran, ghaat shrinkhalaa ke yoga or jyaaon kii ek talika shaamil hai
 Arya-siddhanta, a work on astronomical calculations that is now extinct, comes to us from the writings of Varahamihira, contemporary of Aryabhata, as well as later mathematicians and commentators including Brahmagupta and Bhaskara
 I
 It seems that this work is based on the old Surya Siddhanta and compared to the midnight-day calculation in Aryabhatiya's sunrise
 Has been used isame anek khagoleey upkarnon kaa varnan shaamil he, jaise ki nomon, ek parchaai yantra, sambhawatah kone maapi upkaran, ardhavritakar or vrittakar, ek belanaakaar chadi yasti-yantra, ek chhatra-aakar kaa upkaran jise chhatra- yantra kaha gaya he or kam se kam do prakaar kii jal ghadiyaan- dhanushakar or belanaakaar
 a third text that exists in the form of an Arabic translation is Al Ntf or Al Nnf, claims to be a translation of Aryabhata, but its Sanskrit name is unknown
 sambhawatah 9 ve sadi ke abhilekhan main, yah farsi vidwaan or bhartiya itihaaskaar abu rehaan al-biruni dwaara ullekith kiya gaya he
 Main article Aryabhatiya aryabhat ke kaary ke pratyaksh vivaran sirf aryabhatiy se hi gyaat hai
 The name Aryabhatiya is given by later commentators, Aryabhata himself would not have named it; This is mentioned by his disciple Bhaskara i in the articles of Ashmakatantra or Ashmaka
 ise kabhi kabhi arya-shat-asht - jo kii unke paath main chhandon kii sankhya he- ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 This sutra is written in a very concise style similar to literature, where each line helps to recall a complex system
 is prakaar, arth kii vyakhya tippaneekaron kii vajah se he
 There are 108 verses in the entire book, as well as 13 introductory additions, the whole is divided into four verses or chapters: iske atirikt, kuch sanskarnon ant main kritiyon kii prashansa aadi karne ke liye kuch pushpikaayen bhi jodate hai
 Aryabhatiya introduced some innovations in mathematics and astronomy in verse form, which were influential for many centuries
 granth kii sankshiptata kii charam seemaa kaa varnan unke shishy bhaskar pratham dwaara apni samikshaon main kiya gaya he or apane aryabhatiy bhashya main nilkanth somyaji dwaara
 In the history of India, which is known as 'gupta period' or 'golden Age', at that time India made unprecedented progress in the fields of literature, art and science
 us samay magadh sthit nalanda vishvavidhyalay gyandaan kaa pramukh or prasiddh centre tha
 Students from foreign countries used to come here for learning
 vahaan khagolashastra ke adhyayan ke liye ek vishesh vibhaag tha
 According to an ancient verse Aryabhata was also the chancellor of Nalanda University
 aryabhat kaa bharat or vishwa ke jyotish siddhanth par bahut prabhaav rahaa he
 The most influence in India was on the astrological tradition of the state of Kerala
 aryabhat bhartiya ganitagyon main sabase mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 In 120 Aryachandas, he has written the principles of astrology and the mathematics related to it in his Aryabhatiya treatise
 unhone ek ore ganit main purvavarti archimedes se bhi adhik sahi tathaa sunishchit pai ke maan ko nirupit kiya to duusari ore khagolvigyaan main sabase pehali baar udhaaharan ke saath yah ghoshit kiya gaya ki swayan prithvi apni dhuree par gumti he
 This is the importance of what Aryabhata had discovered without the present day advanced means of astrology
 koparnicus ne jo khoj kii thi uski khoj aryabhat hajaar varsh pehle kar chuke the
 In "golapada", Aryabhata wrote "when a man in a boat moves with the flow, then he understands that the material trees, stones, mountains etc
 are going in reverse
 usee prakaar gatiman prithvi par se sthir nakshatra bhi ulti gati se jate hue dikhaai dete hai
 "thus Aryabhata first proved that the earth rotates on its axis
 inhone satyuga, treta, dwapar or kaliyug ko samaan mana he
 According to them, 14 manvantars in one kalpa and 72 mahayugas in one manvantar and Satyuga, Dwapara, Treta and Kaliyug in one chaturyuga are considered equal
 aryabhat ke anusaar kisi vrutt kii paridhi or vyas kaa sambandh 62,832 : 20,000 aata he jo chaar dashamalav sthaan tak shuddh he
 Aryabhata has used a very scientific method of representing large numbers with a group of letters
 sthaan-mulya ank pranali, jise sarvapratham teesri sadi kii bakhshali pandulipi main dekha gaya, unke kaaryon main spasht rup se vidyaman thi
 He did not use the symbol, of course, but according to the French mathematician Georges Efrah — with zero coefficients, knowledge of zero as a place holder for the power of ten was contained in Aryabhata's place-value digit system
 haalanki, aryabhat ne brahmi ankon kaa prayog nahin kiya tha; vaidic kaal se chali aa rahi sanskrit parampara ko nirantar rakhte hue unhone sankhya ko nirupit karne ke liye varnmaala ke aksharon kaa upyog kiya,matraaon ko smarak ke rup main vyakt karnaa
 Aryabhata worked on Pai's approximation and may have come to know that Pai is irrational
 aryabhatium ke duusare bhaag main ve likhte hai: According to this, the ratio of diameter and circumference is × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416, which is perfectly accurate up to five significant figures
 aryabhat ne asann, pichley shabd ke thik pehle aane vaala, shabd kii vyakhya kii vyakhya karte hue kaha he ki yah na keval ek sanniktan he, varan yah ki mulya athulaneey he
 If this is correct, then this is a very sophisticated approach, as the irrationality of pi in Europe was proved only by Lambert in 1761
 aryabhatiy ke arabi main anuwaad ke pashchaat bijganit par mohammad ebn musa al-khwaarizmi kii pustak main is sanniktan kaa ullekh kiya gaya tha
 In Mathematica 6, Aryabhata describes the area of a triangle as: iskaa anuwaad yah he : kisi tribhuj kaa kshetrafal, lamb ke saath bhujaa ke aadhe ke parinaam ke baraabar hota he
 Aryabhata has discussed the subject of duality in his work and named it Ardha-jya which literally means "ardha-tantra"
 aasaani kii vajah se logon ne ise jya kahana shuru kar diya
 When his work was translated from Sanskrit to Arabic by Arabic writers, he called it Jiba
 chunki, arabi lekhan main, swaron kaa istemaal bahut kam hota he, isliye iskaa or sankshipt naam pad gaya jb
 When later writers came to understand that JB is a short form of Jiba, they started using Jiba back
 jiba kaa arth he "khoh" yaa "khai" 
 Later in the twelfth century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jiba with its Latin counterpart sinus, which literally means "lair" or trench
 or uske baad angreji main, sinus hi sin ban gaya
 a problem of particular interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to equations that are in the form ax + b = cy, a topic known today as the diophantine equation
 yahan aryabhatiy par bhaskar kii vyakhya se ek udhaaharan dete hai: That is, say n = 8x + 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 This leaves the smallest value 85 for N
 saamaanya taur par, diophentine sameekaran kathinata ke liye badnaam the
 Such equations are widely discussed in the ancient Vedic text Sulab Sutra, the more ancient parts of which date back to 800 BC
 Can be older
 aisi samasyaon ke hal ke liye aryabhat kii vidhi ko kuttak vidhi kaha gaya he
 kuṭṭaka kuttak means grinding, that is, breaking into small pieces and this method consisted of a recursive algorithm for writing the original segments as small numbers
 aaj yah kalanvidhi, 621 isvi pashchaat main bhaskar kii vyakhya ke anusaar, pehle kram ke diophentine samikarnon ko hal karne ke liye maanak paddati he,or ise aksar aryabhat elgoridm ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Diophantine equations are used in cryptology and the RSA Convention, 2006 focused on the Kuttaka method and earlier works of Sulvasutra
 aryabhatiy main aryabhat ne virgon or ghanon kii shrenee ke rochak parinaam pradaan kiye hai
 And aryabhat kii khagol vigyaan pranali audaayak pranali kehalaati thi, khagol vigyaan par unke baad ke lekh, jo satahi taur parek dwitiya model, prastaavit karte hai, kho gaye hai, parantu inhe aanshik rup se brahmagupta ke khandakhadyak main hui charchaaon se punah nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some texts, they attribute the rotation of the Earth to the virtual motion of the sky
 prathit hota he ki aryabhat yah maanate the ki prithvi apni dhuree kii parikrama karti he
 This is known from a statement referencing Sri Lanka, which describes the motion of stars as the relative motion produced by the rotation of the Earth
 aglaa chand taron or grahon kii gati ko vaastavik gati ke rup main varnit karata he: Lanka here is a reference point on the equator, which was taken to be the same value in terms of the meridian for astronomical calculations
 aryabhat ne saura mandal ke ek bhukendriya model kaa varnan kiya he, jisame surya or chandramaa gruhachakra dwaara gati karte hai, jo ki parikrama karata heprithvi kii
 In this model, which is found in the Pitamahist theory, the motion of each of the planets is controlled by two planetary cycles, a small slow planetary cycle and a large early planetary cycle
 prithvi se duuri ke anusaar grahon kaa kram is prakaar he : chandramaa, budh, shukr, suraj, mangal,brihaspati, shani or nakshatra The position and duration of the planets were calculated as relative to points moving uniformly, in the case of Mercury and Venus, which revolve around the Earth at the same speed as the average Sun, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn In the case of, which move around the Earth in the zodiac at their specific speed
 khagol vigyaan ke adhikansh itihaaskaaron ke anusaar yah dwi grahchakr vaala model tolemi ke pehle ke greek khagol vigyaanke tatwon ko pradarshit karata he
 Another element of Aryabhata's model, the Sighrocca, the period of the basic planets in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a mark of an underlying Sun-centered model
 unhone kaha ki chandramaa or grah surya ke paravartit prakaash se chamakate hai
 Unlike the existing cosmology, in which the eclipses were the pseudo-planet Nispand point Rahu and Ketu, they described the eclipses as being cast by the earth and the shadow falling on it
 is prakaar chandragahan tab hota he jab chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh karata he or prithvi kii is chaaya ke aakaar or vistaar kii vistaar se charchaa kii or phir grahan ke dauraan grahan vaale bhaag kaa aakaar or isaki gananaa
 Later Indian astronomers improved these calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the major gist
 yah gananaatmak misaal itani sateek thi ki 18 veen sadi ke vaigyanik guilom le jentil ne, pandicherry kii apni yatra ke dauraan, paaya ki bharatiyon kii gananaa ke anusaar 1765-08-30 ke chandragrahan kii avadhi 41 second kam thi, jabaki uske chart 68 second adhik darshaate the
 According to Aryabhata, the circumference of the Earth is 39,968
0582 kilometers, which is only 0
2% less than its actual value of 40,075
0167 kilometers
 yah sanniktan unani ganitagya, eratosthenas kii sanganana ke upar ek ullekhneey sudhaar tha,200 i
) jinaki gananaa kaa aadhunik ikaayiyon main to pataa nahin he, parantu unke anumaan main lagbhag 5-10% kii ek truti avashya thi
 If added to the modern English units of time, Aryabhata's calculation of the Earth's period of time) was 23 hours 56 minutes and 4
1 seconds; Modern time is 23: 56: 4
091
 isi prakaar, unke hisaab se prithvi ke varsh kii avadhi 365 din 6 ghante 12 minute 30 second, aadhunik samay kii gananaa ke anusaar isamen 3 minute 20 second kii truti he
 The perception of the constellation of time was known in most other astronomical systems at that time, but this computation was probably the purest at that time
 aryabhat kaa daawa tha ki prithvi apni hi dhuree par gumti he or unke grah sambandhi grahchakr modelon ke kuch tatv usee gati se ghoomte hai jis gati se surya ke chaaron ore grah ghoomte hai
 Thus it is suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on the underlying Sun-centered model, in which planets orbit the Sun
 ek samiksha main is surya kendrit vyakhya kaa vistrut khandan he
 This review BL a book by Van der Varden describes "this book is unknown about Indian home doctrine and it directly contradicts every word of Aryabhata"
 However, some people accept that Aryabhata's system stems from an earlier Sun-centered model, which he did not know
 yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki ve grahon ke maarg ko andakaar maanate the, haalaanki iske liye koi bhi praathmik sakshya prastut nahin kiya gaya he
 Although Aristarchus of Samos and sometimes Heraclides of Pontus are credited with knowledge of the Sun-centered theory, Greek astronomy known in ancient India makes no discussion of the Sun-centered theory
 bhartiya khagoleey parampara main aryabhat ke kaary kaa bada prabhaav tha or anuwaad ke madhyam se inhone kai padosi samskritiyon ko prabhavit kiya
 Its Arabic translation was particularly influential during the Islamic Golden Age
 unke kuch parinaamon ko al-khwarijmi dwaara uddhrut kiya gaya he or 10 veen sadi ke arabi vidwaan al-biruni dwaara unhen sandarbhit kiya gaya gaya he, jinhone apane varnan main likhaa he ki aryabhat ke anuyaayi maanate the ki prithvi apni dhuree par gumti he
 His definitions of sine, cosine as well as versine, and inverse sine, influenced the origin of trigonometry
 ve pehle vyakti bhi the jinhone sin or varsin talikaon ko, 0 degree se 90 degree tak 3
75 ° antaraalon main, 4 dashamalav sthanon kii sookshmata tak nirmit kiya
 In fact the modern names of "sine" and "cosine" are the incorrect pronunciation of the words sine and cosine as practiced by Aryabhata
 unhen arabi main jiba or kojiba ke rup main uccharit kiya gaya tha
 He was then misinterpreted by Gerard of Cremona during the translation of an Arabic geometry text into Latin; He took the Arabic word 'pocket' for jiba which means "a seam in a dress", el sinus
 aryabhat kii khagoleey gananaa kii vidhiyaan bhi bahut prabhaavshaalee thi
 Along with trigonometric tables, they were widely used in the Islamic world
 or anek arabi khagoleey talikaon kii gananaa ke liye istemaal kii jaati thi
 In particular, the astronomical tables found in the works of the Arabic Spain scientist al-jharkali were translated into Latin as the tables of Toledo and have been in use for centuries as the most subtle almanac in Europe
 aryabhat or unke anuyaayiyon dwaara kii gayi tithi gananaa panchang athwa hindu tithipatr nirdhaaran ke vyaavhaarik uddeshyon ke liye bharat main nirantar istemaal main rahi hai, inhe islamic duniya ko bhi preshit kiya gaya, jahaan inase jalaalee tithipatr kaa aadhaar taiyaar kiya gaya jise 1073 main umr khayyam sahit kuch khagolavidon ne prastut kiya, jiske sanskaran aaj iran or afghanistan main rashtriya calendar ke rup main prayog main hai
 The Jalali Tithipatra estimates its dates on the basis of actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata
 This type of date sheet requires an almanac to calculate the dates
 yadhyapi tithiyon kii gananaa karnaa kathin tha, par jalaalee tithipatr main gregory tithipatr se kam mausami trutiyaan thi
 India's first satellite, Aryabhata, was named after him
 chandra khadd aryabhat kaa naam unke sammaan swarup rakhaa gaya he
 An institute near Nainital in India has been named Aryabhata Observational Science Research Institute for research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences
 antarvidyalaya aryabhat ganit pratiyogita unke naam par he
 Bacillus Aryabhata, a species of bacteria discovered in 2009 by ISRO scientists, is named after him

 Satyavati had two sons named Chitrangad and Vichitravirya
 shantanu kaa swargvaas chitrangad or vichitraveery ke balykaal main hi ho gaya tha isaliye unka paalan poshan bhishma ne kiya
 Bhishma installed Chitrangad on the throne as he grew up, but in a short period, Chitrangad was killed while fighting with Gandharvas
 is par bhishma ne unke anuj vichitraveery ko rajya saunp diya
 Now Bhishma was worried about the marriage of Vichitravirya
 unheen dinon kashiraj kii teen kanyaon, amba, ambika or ambalika kaa swayamvar hone vaala tha
 Going to his swayamvara, Bhishma alone defeated all the kings who came there and after killing all the three girls brought them to Hastinapur
 badi kanya amba ne bhishma ko bataaya ki vah apana tan-man raja shalve ko arpit kar chuki he
 On hearing this, Bhishma sent him to King Shalva and got Ambika and Ambalika married to Vichitravirya
 raja shalve ne amba ko grahan nahin kiya atah vah hastinapur laut kar aa gai or bhishma se boli, “he arya! aap mujhe har kar laaye hai atev aap mujhase vivaah karen
 "but Bhishma did not accept his request because of his promise
 amba rusht ho kar parashuram ke paas gai or unase apni vyathaa suna kar sahaayta maangi
 Parashurama said to Amba, "oh God! Don't worry, i will get you married with Bhishma
 ” parashuram ne bhishma ko bulaava bheja kintu bhishma unke paas nahin gayi
 Angry at this, Parashurama reached Bhishma and a terrible war broke out between the two heroes
 donon hi abhootpurv yoddha the isaliye haar-jeet kaa faisla nahin ho sakaa
 After all, the Gods intervened and ended this war
 amba niraash ho kar van main tapasya karne chali gai
 Vichitravirya indulged in indulgence with both her queens, but she had no children with both queens and died of tuberculosis
 ab kul naash hone ke bhay se mata satyavati ne ek din bhishma se kaha, “putr! is vansh ko nasht hone se bachaane ke liye meri ajna he ki tum in donon raniyon se putr utpann karo
 After listening to Mother, Bhishma said, "mother! i cannot break my vows under any circumstances
 ” Mother Satyavati felt very sad to hear this
 achaanak unhen apane putr vedavyas kaa samaran ho aayaa
 As soon as he remembered, Ved Vyas appeared there
 satyavati unhen dekh kar boleen, “he putr! tumhaare sabhi bhai nihsantaan hi swargavaasi ho gayi
 Therefore, to save my descendants from perishing, i command you to produce children from their wives
 ” vedavyas unki ajna maan kar bole, “mata! aap un donon raniyon se kah dijiye ki ve ek varsh tak niyam-vrath kaa paalan karte rahen tabhi unako garbh dhaaran hoga
 After a year had passed, Ved Vyas first went to the elder queen Ambika
 ambika ne unke tej se dar kar apane netra band kar liye
 Returning to Ved Vyas, he said to Mata, "mata Ambika will have a great son, but he will be blind due to the defect of closing the eyes
 ” satyavati ko yah sun kar atyant dukh hua or unhon ne vedavyas ko choti rani ambalika ke paas bheja
 Ambalika was pale in fear upon seeing Ved Vyasa
 uske kaksh se lautne par vedavyas ne satyavati se kaha, “mata! ambalika ke garbh se pandu rog se grasit putr hoga
 "this made Mata Satyavati even more sad and she ordered the elder queen Ambalika to go to Ved Vyasa again
 is baar badi rani ne swayan na ja kar apni daasi ko vedavyas ke paas bhej diya
 Maid pleasantly got Ved Vyas
 is baar vedavyas ne mata satyavati ke paas aa kar kaha, “maate! is daasi ke garbh se veda-veydant main paarangat atyant nitivaan putr utpann hoga
 After saying this, Ved Vyas went to do penance
 samay aane par ambika ke garbh se janmaandh dhritarashtra, ambalika ke garbh se pandu rog se grasit pandu tathaa daasi ke garbh se dharmatma vidura kaa janm hua

 Digital electronics or digital electronics is a branch of electronics in which electrical signals are numeric
 ankiy sanket bahut tarah ke ho sakate hai kintu binary digital sanket sabase adhik upyog main aate hai
 Zero / one, on / off, yes / no, low / high etc
 are some examples of binary signals
 jabase ekikrut paripathon kaa pradurbhaav hua he or ek choti si chip main lakhon karondon electronic yuktiyaan bhari jane lageen hai tab se digital electronic bahut mahatvapurn ho gayi he
 Modern personal computers and cell phones, digital cameras etc

 ankiy electronic, yaa sookshmadvik aankik paddati aisi pranali he jo vidyut sanketon ko, rekhiy str ke ek nirantar pattiyon ke bajaae ek alag alag pattiyon kii shrinkhalaa ke rup main darshaati he
 All levels in this stripe indicate the same state of signals
 sanketo kii is pruthakta kii vajah se nirmaan sahansheeltaa ke kaadan rekhiy sanketo ke str main aaye apekshaakrit chote badlaav alag aavaran nahin chhodte he
 As a result, the circuit sensing the state of the signals ignores them
 zyaadaatar maamalon main sanketo kii avasthaa kii sankhya do hoti he or in do avasthaaon ko do voltage staron dwaara darshaya jaataa he: prayog main aapurti voltage ke aadhaar par ek va doosraa | 1 ucch str par hota he va 0 nimna str par
 Often these two levels are represented as "low" and "high"
 aankik takanic kaa mul laabh is tathy par aadhaarit he ki sanketo kii ek satat shrinkhalaa ko punarutpaadit karne ke bajaae, electronic upkaran ko sanketo kii 0 yaa 1 jaise kisi gyaat avasthaa main bhejnaa zyada aasaan hota he
 Digital electronics are generally made up of large combinations of logic gates and simple electronics of Boolean logic functions

 For example, a signal of a long sound made in the order of 1 and 0 can be reconstructed without error provided that the noise produced during the making of the signal is not so much that 1 and 0 cannot be detected
 
 sidi main ek ghante ke sangeet ko kareeb 60 lakh dwiadhari ankon ke rup main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 In a digital system, more binary digits can be used to represent a more accurate signal

 Storage of information can be done easily in digital system as compared to analog
 digital system kaa shor pratiraksha vighatan ke bina data ko sangrahit or punah praapt karne kii anumati detaa he
 In an analog system, noise from old and discarded information is stored
 ek digital pranali main jab tak kul shorgul ek nishchit str se neeche he, jaankaree ko puri tarah se punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases digital circuits use more energy than analog circuits to do similar work and thus heat is generated
 portable yaa bydaree chaalit pranaaliyon main yah digital pranali ke upyog ko simit kar sakati he
 Battery-powered cellular telephones, for example, often use a low-power analog forearm to amplify and establish radio signals from the base station
 haalanki ek base stesan ke paas grid kii shakti hoti he or apekshit vidyut kaa prayog kar sakati he, lekin bahut lacheele software radio main
 is tarah ke base steshnon ke liye aasaani se nae cellular maanakon main prayukt sanket prakriya ko aasaani se riprogram kiya ja saktaa he
 Digital circuits are sometimes very expensive, especially in small quantities
 sanvedya jagat enlog ke hai or is jagat se sanket enlog matraaen hai
 For example light, temperature, sound, electrical conductivity, electrical and magnetic bases are analogs
 sabase upyogi digital system nirantar analog sanketon se digital sanketon ko alag karne ke liye badalanaa hoga
 This causes quantization errors
 agar system vaanchit degree kii vishwastata ke pratinidhitiv karne ke liye paryaapt digital data kaa bhandaaran karata he to parimanikaran truti ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The Nyquist – Shannon sampling theorem provides an important directive of how much digital data is required to accurately represent a defined analog signal
 kuch pranaaliyon main yadi digital data kaa ek bhaag lupt ho jaae yaa galat tareeke se vyavahrut hon, to sambandhit data ke vishaal khandon kaa arth puri tarah se badal saktaa he
 Because of the clef effect, it is difficult for users to tell if a specific system was right on the verge of failure or whether it can tolerate too much noise before it fails
 digital bhangshiltaa ko ek digital pranali ke roopankan dwaara majbootee ke liye kam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a parity bit or other error handling method can be inserted into the signal path
 yah paddati system ko, truti kaa pataa lagane main madad karti he or yaa to trutiyon ko sahi karti he yaa phir kam se kam data kii ek nai pratilipi ke liye puuchhati he
 State transition logic in a state machine can be designed to hold unused state and trigger a reset sequence or other routine error recovery

 This helps protect against failures that can cause the microcontroller instruction to spoil the indicator, which might otherwise lead to the execution of random code
 digital smriti or sanchaaran pranali truti kaa pataa lagane or sudhaar jaise takneekon kaa istemaal sanchaaran or storage main kisi bhi truti ke sudhaar ke liye atirikt data kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 On the other hand in digital systems some techniques are used to make those systems' single bit errors more vulnerable
 ye takanic tabhi sweekaarya hote hai jab antarnihit bits un trutiyon ke nahin hone kii sambhaavna se kaaphi vishwasaneey hote hai
 Digital circuits are composed of analog components
 iske dizin se sunishchit hona chahie ki analog ghatakon ke lakshan icchit digital vyavhaar par haaavee naa hon
 digital system ko shorgul or samay margin, paraseete anugam or capcitance or filter bijli conection kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 Poor design leads to intermittent problems such as glitches, vanishing fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, "runt pulses" not reaching valid threshold voltages or a combination of unexpected logic states
 jab se digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai digital circuit lo-prisishan se bhi dhire gananaa karata he jo ek samaan spes or shakti kaa prayog karata he
 However the digital circuit will be able to assess repeatedly due to its high noise immunity
 On the other hand, analog circuits in high precision domains need more power and digital equivalent area
 ek digital circuit kaa nirmaan aksar logic gates kahe jane vaale chote se electronic circuit se kiya jaataa he
 Each logic gate represents the processes of Boolean logic
 logic get vidyut niyantrit switch kii ek vyavastha hoti he
 The output of a logic gate is an electric current or voltage that can control and bend most logic gates
 aksar logic gates unke aakaar, bijli kii khapat or laagat ko kam karne or unki vishwasaneeyata kii vruddhi karne ke liye sabase kam sankhya main transistor kaa upyog karata he
 Integrated circuits are the least important method of making large amounts of logic gates
 aam taur par ejiniyaron dwaara electronic dizin swachaalan software kaa upyog kar ekikrut circuit kaa dizin kiya hota he 
 Another form of digital circuit consists of lookup tables
 lukup talika, mashiinon par aadhaarit logic geton kii tarah hi kaary kar sakati hai lekin aasaani se taron ko badale bina hi riprogram kar sakati hai
 This means that designers can often repair design errors without changing the wiring arrangement
 isliye choti maatra main utpaada programeble logic divaais aksar adhimaanya samaadhaan kar rahe hai
 They are typically designed by engineers using electronic design automation software
 jab sanskaran madhyam se bade hote hai or tark dhime ho sakate hai yaa jatil elgoritham yaa anukram shaamil kiye jate hai, tab aksar ambeded pranali banane ke liye ek chota-se microcontrolar ko program kiya jaataa he
 These are usually programmed by software engineers
 jab keval ek digital circuit kii aavashyaktaa ho or isaki dizin puri tarah se customiod ho, tab fectory production line controlar ke liye paaramparik samaadhaan programeble logic controlar yaa PLC he
 These are typically programmed by electricians using logic ladders
 logic kriyaaon ko kam karne ke liye ejeeniyar kai tareekon ko apanaate hai, taaki circuit kii jatilta ko kam kiya ja sake
 When complexity is low, circuit errors and electronics are also less and hence they are less expensive

 Representations are important for the design of an engineer's digital circuit
 kuch vishleshan vidhiyaan keval vishesh pratinidhitiv ke saath kaam karti hai
 Representation of digital circuits with an equivalent set of logic gates is a classical method
 praayah kam se kam electronic ke saath electronic swichon ke samakaksh pranali kaa nirmaan ek doosraa tarika he 
 One of the easiest ways is to have a memory with only one table
 memory ke pate par input daale jate hai or memory ke data autput, autput ban jate hai
 These reports have digital file formats for automatic analysis that can be processed by computer programs
 adhikansh digital ejeeniyar anukool fil swaroop ke saath computer program ke chayan main saavdhaanee baratate hai
 Engineers consider the types of digital systems for reporting
 adhikansh digital system "sangyojan system" or "anukramik system" main vibhajit ho jate hai
 The input that is given in a combination system always gives the same output
 yah mul rup se logic prakriya ke set kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or jisaki charchaa pehle hi kii ja chuki he
 a sequential system is a combinatorial system with outputs inserted as inputs
 isse digital mashin opershan kaa kram se sanchaalan karata he
 The simplest sequential system is probably a flip flop, a mechanism that represents a binary digit or "bit"
 anukramik pranali ko aksar state mashin ke rup main dizin kiya jaataa he
 In this way engineers can design the aggregate behavior of a system and even test it in continuous simulation without considering the details of the logic processes without considering all the details of the logic functions
 anukramik system iske atirikt do upashreniyon main vibhajit hota he
 When a "clock" signal changes the state, the "synchronous" sequential system changes the state at once
 jab bhi input badalte hai "atulykaalik" anukramik pranali parivartan ko prasaarit karata he
 Synchronous sequential systems are made up of special components of asynchronous circuits such as flip flops, which make these changes only when the clock changes and in which the timing margin is carefully designed
 hameshaa kii tarah ek tulykaalik anukramik state mashin ko ek sangyojan logic main vibhajit karke lagu karne kaa vyaavhaarik tarika hota he or flip flop ke set ko "state register" kaha jaataa he
 Each time a clock gives a ticking signal and the state register captures the response generated from the previous state of the combinational logic and re-inserts it as the invariant input to the combinational part of the state machine
 sangyojan logic main samay ke khapat vaale adhikansh logic akalan dwaara ghadi kii sabase tej dar set hoti he
 The state register represents just one binary number
 agar state mashin main state bahut zyada hai to logic prakriya kuch sangyojan logic hote hai jo kai sankhya main state kaa utpaadan karti hai
 In comparison, the design of asynchronous systems is very difficult because the possible state must be considered at all possible times
 nunatam or adhiktam samay ke teble ke nirmaan ke sabase saamaanya vidhi ke anusaar isamen saare state vidyaman ho or vaise state ke minimise ke liye circuit ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or jo iske sabhi hisson ke susangat state main samay-samay par jane ke liye circuit ko baadhya kare
 aise saavdhaan dizin ke bina sanyogvash atulykaalik logic kaa utpaadan karnaa aasaan he jo "asthir" he or vaastavik electronics he jisamen apratyaashit parinaam hote hai kyonki electronic upkarnon ke mulyon main chote badlaavon kii vajah se sanchit vilamb hota he
 Some circuits are inherently asynchronous in their design and should be analyzed as such
 2005 ke rup main lagbhag sabhi digital mashine tulykaalik dizin hote hai kyonki tulykaalik dizin ko bananaa or satyapit karnaa bahut aasaan he-vartmaan main digital mashiinon kii nakal karne vaale softver, atulykaalik dizin ko nahin sambhalate
 tathaapi, atulykaalik tark ko behatar samajha jaataa he, yadi usase kaam nikaala ja sake to, kyonki uski gati ghadi dwaara manamaane dhang se gati simit nahin he, bajaay, yah un logic geton dwaara anumat gati par saamaanya rup se chalati he, jinase inkaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Constructing an asynchronous circuit using fast parts indirectly "runs" the circuit faster
 aam taur par, kai digital system, data pravaah mashine hai
 Often they are designed using synchronous register transfer logic and have been used as VHDL or Verilog hardware description languages
 register hastantaran logic main dwiadhari sankhya flip flop ke samoohon main sangrahit hai jise register kaha jaataa tha
 The output of each register is a bundle of wires called a "bus" that passes that number for other estimation
 yah akalan keval sangyojan logic kaa ek bhaag he
 Each estimation has a bus output and can be connected to multiple input registers
 kabhi-kabhi ek register ke paas inke input par bahusanketak hota he jisase yah kai bason main se kisi ek se nambar ko store kar saktaa he
 Alternatively the output of several things can be connected via buffers which can turn off the output of all devices except one
 input se prayek register ke naye data ko sweekaar karne par anukramik state mashin niyantran karata he
 In the 1980s some researchers found that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs using first-in-first-out synchronization logic
 is yojana main digital mashin, ek data pravaah ke ek set ke rup main pahachaani jaati he
 At each step of the flow, an asynchronous "synchronization circuit" determines when the output of that step is solid and gives a presented signal to "hold the data" to the stages in which the inputs to those stages are used
 iske liye kuch apekshaakrit saral tulykaalan circuit kii aavashyaktaa he
 The most general-purpose transfer-logic machine is a computer
 yah multah ek swat: binary abekas he
 The control unit of a computer is typically designed as a micro program run by a microsensor
 yah micro program ek player-piano role kii tarah hoti he
 Each table commands every bit of entry or "word" state of the micro program that controls the computer
 anukramak phir use ginati karata he or memory yaa sangyojan logic mashin main yah ginati sambodhit karata he jisamen micro program samahit hota he
 The bits from the microprogram control the arithmetic logic unit, memory and other parts of the computer, and the microservices itself
 is tarah computer ke niyantran kii digining ke jatil kaary ko apekshaakrit kaaphi saral logic mashiinon ke sangrah ke saral kaaryon main parivartit kar diya gaya
 Computer architecture is a specialized engineering activity that tries to classify registers, assessment logic, buses, and other parts of a computer in some way for the best purpose
 computer vaastukar ne laagat kam karne or gati ko teevr karne or computer programing trutiyon kii pratiraksha ke liye computer ke dizin main vrihad maatra main suprayog ko lagaaya he
 And its simple purpose is to reduce power in a fast battery powered computer system
 kai computer architech microprogrammers ke rup main vistrut prashikshuta kii seva de rahe hai
 "typical computers" are typically a traditional computer with a special purpose micro program
 mahange ejineering prayaason se bachane ke liye, badi logic mashiinon ke dizine banane ke prayaas kaaphi kuch swachaalit kar die gaye hai
 Computer programs are called "electronic design automation devices" or simply "EDA"
 logic kaa, saral truth teble-style kaa vivaran, aksar EDA ke saath ishtatam kiya jaataa he jo logic get kii ghatit pranaaliyon ko swatah utpaadit karata he yaa chote lukup teble ko, jo abhi bhi vaanchit parinaam dete hai
 The most common example of this type of software is the espresso heuristic logic minimizer
 vishaal logic pranaliyon ke anukulan ke liye adhikansh vyaavhaarik elgoridam, bijiy jodtod yaa dwiadhari nirnay aarekh kaa upyog karte hai or anuvanshik kalan vidhi or tapiya anukulan ke saath prayog, sambhaavna se bhare hai
 To automate costly engineering processes, some edas can take state tables that describe a state machine and can produce a truth table or a function table for a mixed part of a state machine
 state teble paath kaa ek tukdaa he jo prayek state ko paristhitiyon ke saath soochibaddh karata he, jo unke or sambandhit utpaadan sanketon ke bich sankraman ko niyantrit karata he
 It is common for function tables of such computer generated state machines to be optimized with the logic minimization software Minelog
 aksar, vaastavik logic pranaliyaan, up-pariyojnaon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke rup main dizin kii gai hoti hai, jinhen ek "upkaran pravaah" ke upyog se sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 The tool flow is usually a "script", a simple computer language that can implement software design tools in the correct order
 bade logic system ke liye upkaran pravaah, jaise microprocesar, hajaaron cmand lambey ho sakate hai or saikadon ejiniyaron ke kaam ko sanyojit karte hai
 Writing and debugging equipment flow is an established engineering specialty in companies producing digital design
 upkaran pravaah aam taur par ek vistrut computer fil yaa filon ke set main mit jaataa he jo yah varnan karata he ki kaise logic kaa bhautik rup se nirmaan karen
 This often includes transistor and wire drawing instructions on an integrated circuit or printed circuit board
 upkaran pravaah ke hisson ko, apekshit input ke khilaaf nakli logic ke output kii pushti karne ke dwaara dibag kiya jaataa he
 Testing equipment takes computer files with a set of inputs and outputs and highlights discrepancies between simulated behavior and expected behavior
 ek baar input data ko sahi maanane ke baad, khud dizine ko abhi bhi shuddhta ke liye satyapit kiya janaa chahie
 Some instrument flows confirm the design first by producing a design and then scanning the design to produce input data relevant to the instrument flow
 yadi scan kiya hua data, input data ke saath mail khaataa he, to upkaran pravaah ne shaayad koi trutiyaan pesh nahin kii
 Functional validation data, usually called "test vectors"
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan vector ko sangrakshit kiya ja saktaa he or kaarkaane main yah pareekshan karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he ki navnirmit logic sahi dhang se kaam karata he yaa nahin
 Functional test patterns, however, do not discover common construction mistakes
 Production tests, often designed by software tools, are called "test pattern generators"
 logic kii sanrachana kii jaanch or vyavasthit dhang se vishesh dosha ke liye test janit kar, ye pareekshan vector ko utpann karte hai
 In this way fault coverage can reach around 100%, provided the design is properly testable
 ek baar koi dizine maujuud he or satyapit or pareekshan yogya he, to ise utpaadit yogya hone ke liye aksar sansaadhit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In modern integrated circuits, the wavelength of light used to illuminate photoresistance has smaller characteristics
 utpaadakta software, expozar mask main mukt-paripath ko samaapt karne ke liye hastkshep pattern jodate hai or mask ke rizolution or contrast main vruddhi karte hai
 a large logic machine can have an astronomical number of possible states
 jaahir he, kaarkaane main, har state kaa pareekshan avyaavhaarik he agar har state ke pareekshan main ek microsecond lagata he or brahmad ke shuru hone se hi microsecond kii sankhya se kahin adhik state hai
 Unfortunately, this ridiculous case is typical
 saubhaahgya se, badi logic mashiinon ko lagbhag hameshaa chote logic mashiinon ke sangyojan ke rup main taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 To save time, small sub-machines are isolated by permanently installed "design for Test" circuitry and tested independently
 "scan dizin" naam kii ek aam pareekshan yojana, test bits ko kramik rup se ek yaa ek se adhik "scan chen" naam ke kramik shift register ke madhyam se hataati he
 In sequential scans, there are only one or two wires to carry the data and reduce the physical size and expenses of the frequently used test logic
 saare pareekshan ke baad, data bits jagah par hai, dizine ko "saamaanya mod" ke liye rikanfigure kiya jaataa he or ek yaa ek se adhik clock pulse ko lagu kiya jaataa hai, taaki dosha kaa pataa lag sake or pareekshan ke parinaam kaa pragrahan scan shift register main flip-flop main or / yaa leches main kiya jaataa he
 Finally, the test result is shifted to the block boundary and the forecast is compared against the "good machine" result
 ek board test paryaavaran main samanaantar testing ke kram ko, ek maanak "JTAG" ke saath aupchaarik rup diya gaya he 
 Another common test scheme provides a test mode that forces parts of the logic machine to enter a "probe cycle"
 pareekshan chakra, aam taur par mashin ke bade swatantra bhaagon kaa prayog karata he
 The practicality of a system of digital logic determines many things
 fainout, gati, kam laagat or vishwasaneeyata kaa ek adarsh sangyojan praapt karne ke liye, ejiniyaron ne kai electronic upkarnon kaa nirikshan kiya
 The cost of a logic gate is significant
 1930 ke dashak main, praarambhik digital logic system, telephone riley se banaae jate the kyonki ye saste or apekshaakrit vishwasaneey the
 After that, engineers always used the cheapest available electronic switch, which could still meet the requirements
 praarambhik ekikrut paripath ek aanandadaayak sanyog the
 They were not built to save money, but to save weight, and to allow the Apollo Guidance computer to control a spacecraft an internal guidance system
 pehla ekikrut paripath logic get kii keemat kareeb $50 thi 
 Surprising everyone, when circuits began to be produced in bulk, they became the cheapest method of manufacturing digital logic
 is praudyogiki main sudhaar ne laagat main sabhi baad ke sudhaaron ko prerit kiya
 With the increase of integrated circuits, reducing the absolute number of chips used introduced another way of saving costs
 ek diziner kaa lakshya sirf aasaan circuit bananaa nahin he, balki ghatak kii ginati kam rakhana he
 Sometimes this results in a slightly more complex design with respect to the underlying digital logic, but still reduces the number of components, board size, and even power consumption
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch logic pariwaron main, NAND get, nirmaan hone vaale saralatam digital get hai
 All other logic operations can be implemented by the NAND gate
 yadi ek circuit ko pehle se hi ek NAND get kii aavashyaktaa he or ek ekal chip aam taur par chaar NAND get rakhata he, to baaki ke get ko anya logic karravaiyon ko jaise logical and lagu karne ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 This can eliminate the need for a chip with those different types of gate
 ek logic get kii "vishwasaneeyata", asafalataa ke bich uske ausat samay kaa varnan karti he
 Digital machines often have millions of logic gates
 iske alaava, adhikansh digital mashiinon ko unki laagat ko kam karne ke liye "anukulit" kiya jaataa he
 The result is clear, failure of a single logic gate will cause a digital machine to stop working
 digital mashine, pehali baar upyogi tab baniin jab ek switch ke liye MTBF kuch sau ghante se upar ho gaya
 Nevertheless, many of these machines had complications, well-practiced repair procedures, and did not work for many hours due to a tube burning or an insect getting stuck in a relay
 aadhunik transistor krit ekikrut paripath logic get main lagbhag ek trilian ghante kaa mtbfs he ), or unki jarurat he kyonki unke paas bahut saare logic get he
 Fanout describes how many logic inputs can be controlled from a single logic output
 nunatam vyaavhaarik fainout kareeb paanch he
 Modern electronic logic that uses CMOS transistors for switches have around fifty fanouts and can sometimes go very high
 "swimming gati" yah bataati he ki ek inwarter prati second kitni baar tru se falls or waapas main badal saktaa he 
 Faster logic can complete more tasks in less time
 digital logic pehali baar tab upyogi ban gaye jab swichan gati pachaas hertz se upar ho gai, kyonki vah yantric calculator kaa sanchaalan kar rahe manushyon ke ek dal se tej thi
 Modern electronic digital logic routinely converts at five ghz and some laboratory systems convert at more than a terahertz
 dizine, riley ke saath shuru hue
 riley logic apekshaakrit sasta or vishwasaneey lekin dhimaa tha
 Sometimes a mechanical failure also occurred
 fainout aam taur par das the, jo coil ke pratirodh dwaara simit the or ucch voltage se sampark par chaap nirmit karte the
 Later, vacuum tubes were used
 ye bahut tej the, lekin garmi utpann karte the or philaments ke jal jane ke kaaran avishwasaneey the
 Fanouts were typically five to seven, which were limited by the heating of the tube
 1950 ke dashak main, philament ke saath vishesh "computer tub" viksit kiye gaye jo silicon kii tarah asthir tatwon ko nikaal dete the
 These last for several thousands of hours
 pehla ardhchaalak logic parivaar, rezister-transistor logic tha
 It was a thousand times more reliable than a tube, ran comfortably and used less power, but had very little fan-in of the three
 diod-transistor logic ne fainout main saat tak sudhaar kiya or bijli main kami kii
 Some DTL designs used two power-supplies with synonym layers of NPN and PNP transistors to increase fanout
 transistor transistor logic in par ek mahaan sudhaar tha
 Among the early instruments, the fanout improved to ten and the later developed type achieved twenty
 TTL bhi tej tha, kuch parivartit rup ne swichan kaa bees nanosecond tak kaa kam samay praapt kar liya
 TTL is still used in some designs
 ek anya daavedaar emetre kapald logic tha
 It is very fast but uses a lot of electricity
 ab iskaa istemaal zyaadaatar radio frequency circuit main kiya jaataa he
 Modern integrated circuits mostly use variations of CMOS, which are admittedly faster, much smaller and use less power
 kuch gati jurmaane ke saath chalis yaa or adhik ke fainout sambhav hai
 Non-electronic digital system construction is possible
 siddhant rup main, asatat state kaa pratinidhitiv or logic kaaryon kaa pratinidhitiv karne main sakasham kisi bhi takanic kaa istemaal yantric logic banane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 MIT students, Erlene Gea, Edward Hardbeck, Danny Hillis, Margaret Minsky and brothers Barry and Brian Silverman, built two computers with tinker toys, string, a brick, and an acute pencil
 tinkartoy computer, boston vigyaan sangrahalay main he
 Hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical versions of the logic gate exist and are used in situations where electricity cannot be used
 The first two types are considered under Fluidix
 fludi logic kaa ek prayog, sainya hardware main he jiske ek vidyut chumbakeey pulse main ujagar hone kii sambhaavna he jo bijli ke circuit ko nasht karata he
 Mechanical logic is often used in cheap controllers such as those in washing machines
 mashhoor rup se, charles babes dwaara pehla computer dizin ko yantric logic ke prayog ke liye dizine kiya gaya tha
 Mechanical logic can also be used in very small computers that can be made by nanotechnology
 ek anya udhaaharan he ki yadi do vishesh anzime kii aavashyaktaa ek vishesh protein ke nirmaan ko rokane ke liye ho to, yah ek jaivik "NAND get ke baraabar he
 The discovery of superconductivity has enabled the development of rapid single flux quantum circuit technology that uses Josephson junction instead of transistors
 haal hi main, aise shuddh optical computing pranali ko banane kaa prayaas kiya gaya, joki nonaliniar optical tatwon kaa prayog karke digital soochna sansaadhit karne main sakasham he

 The girl grew up listening to the legend of Lord Vishnu
 use narayan se prem ho gaya tathaa usne narayan ko man se pati sweekaar liya tha
 Lakshmi came to Lakshmi in the form of Indra Vishnu during that period of penance for thousands of years and asked to ask for a boon, Lakshmi requested to have Vishwaroopa darshan
 ant main bhagwaan vishnu ne lakshmi ko apane viratrup kaa darshan karaayaa tathaa lakshmi or narayan kaa vivaah hua
 Many Puranas have told the story of Mata Lakshmi's displeasure with the Lord and joining the sea

 God Rishi Narada was the Gandharva in the previous birth
 ek baar brahmalok main ek sabha bulaai gai jisamen kai devtaa bhagavannam sankirthan ke liye ekatra hue
 Narada also accompanied his women
 bhagwaan ke sankirthan sabha main bhagavannam chhodkar vinod karte naarad ko brahma ne shudra hone kaa shraap diya
 For this reason Narada was born in the Shudra clan
 inke janm pashchaat hi pita kii mrityu ho gai
 Mother used to work as a maid and feed Narada
 ek samay inke gram main kuch mahatmaon kaa aagaman hua tathaa ve chaturmasya vyateet karne ke liye vahiin ruk gaye
 Narada ji was very good even as a child and left the sports and served those Mahatmas with his heart and used to spend his days there, reciting the Bhagavatakas diligently
 mahatmaon kii seva se inke purvajanm ke paap dhul gaye
 Mahatmas preached Narada to Bhagavanam Sankirtan while going
 sarpdansh se naarad kii mata kaa bhi swargvaas ho gaya
 Like a beggar, he used to stand in front of someone's house for food, then food was received, five-year-old Narada used to avoid these sufferings as a wish of God
 naarad ko anya balak bhi sataate the
 Narada chanted according to the law of the Mahatmas, then Lord Vishnu appeared to him in his quadrilateral form
 tatpashchaat inhen prabhu ke darshan nahin hue
 In the end, he did hard penance and then Lord Vishnu saw him in his Vishwaroopa and said, "narada! In the next life you will be born as the son of Brahma and my councilor, then you will see me every day
" "agle janm main naarad bhagwaan vishnu ke avatar ke rup main brahma ke maanas putr hue
 God pleased the sacrifice and made him see the world as well
 purvajanm main raja bali ek dusht dhutakarma tha jo jua khelaa karata tha
 One day, taking money received from gambling, was running towards a prostitute's house, fainted by a fall and fell into the ground
 is ghatana ke pashchaat usamen shiv bhakthi jaagi tathaa usne shiv kaa pujan kiya
 After death Yama ordered him to suffer the torture of hell
 shiv ke aashirwad se use teen ghadi ke liye swarg kaa rajya mila
 He donated Kalpavriksha, Airavat etc
 to sages
 is dani bhav se use mukti mili tathaa agle janm main bhagwaan vishnu ke param bhakt prahlaad ke pautra ke rup main janm liya
 According to Shrimad Bhagwat, by the seduction of Shukracharya, Bali took over heaven
 sabhi devtaa bhagwaan vishnu ke paas gaye tab vishnu ne vaamanavatar liya
 He was the son of Aditi and brother of Indra
 ve dwadash adityon main barahawein the
 His form was that of a dwarf Brahmin and had a wooden hive in his hand and a kamandalu in the other hand
 bali ashwamedh yajna kar rahaa tha
 All sages used to give small donations to the Mahatmas
 bhagwaan vaaman bali ke paas jaakar teen pag bhoomi maangate hai
 Bali wonders what the three steps will do in the land ?? That's when Shukracharya comes, he informs Bali that this little Brahmin is a real God, but does not hesitate to give sacrifices
 ant main shukracharya sankalp paatr ke chhidr main keet banakar baith jate hai
 When a sacrificial donation tries to pour water from a vowel for determination, not a single drop of water falls from it
 bhagwaan vaaman ek kush ke tukade ko us chhidr main daalate hai jisase shukracharya kaane ho jate hai or vahaan se prasthaan karte hai
 The sacrifice of sacrifice is complete and after that, Bali requests Vamana to measure three feet of land
 bhagwaan kaa aakaar badhata jaataa he ant main bhagwaan viraat swaroop dhaaran karte hai tathaa apana ek pad akaash kii ore badhaate hai
 Narayan's feet easily crossed the heavens etc
 reached Brahmaloka
 vahaan brahma ne padprakshalan kiya jiske jal se taarani ganga pravaahit huin
 a foot of God crosses the realms of Nagaloka, Sutal, Abyss etc
 and reaches the Hades
 bhagwaan ne do pad main hi bali kaa sara rajya naap diya
 The Lord questions Bali, "oh Bali! Now you tell me where do i put my one foot?" The sacrifice then says, "O Palanhar! Please grace me by placing your footstool on my head
" " or prabhu nen apana ek pair bali ke mastak par rakhaa tathaa use sutal lok main sthaan diya
 Bali wanted to have a darshan of Prabhu, so he too went to Suthal Loka with sacrifice
 abhi tak unka ansh raja bali ke dwarpal ke rup main sutal lok main sthapit hai
 Mata Yashoda was also seen by Kanhaiya in another form
 ek din bhagwaan baalkrishna ne mitti kha liya
 Baldau and Krishna's friends told this thing to Mother Yashoda
 mata ne krishna se puchha "kaanhan! kya tumne mitti khai?" krishna ne kaha "nahi maiyaa, nahin khai
 "when Mata asked Baldau, she made Mother aware of the truth
 mata ne krishna ko munh kholane ko kaha
 Unknown Krishna opened his mouth
 mata yashoda krishna ke mukh se andar mitti ke kan dhundne lageen, parantu unako us balak ke munh main aganit brahmad, aganit brahma, vishnu, mahesh, muni, devtaa, maanav, akashganga tathaa kai prakaar ke andekhi vastuain dikhaai dene lageen
 It is written in the Bhagavata that Mother Yashoda saw herself in Krishna's face looking at Krishna's mouth
 prabhu ke is prakaar ke vishwaroop darshan hone ke baad bhi mata yashoda kii nishchal mamata krishna par barasati rahi
 Even after this development, the divine Shri Krishna seemed to be a child
 mahabharat main duryodhana kaa vishwaroop darshan varnit he
 Before the battle of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna went to Hastinapur as a peacekeeper
 vahaan unka satkar hua
 In Rajya Sabha, God said to Duryodhana, "duryodhana! If you want, this great war can be averted
 rajan! tum yudhisthir ko apana aadha rajya de do, yaa to unhen paanch gaanv hi de do, main unhen samjhaaoonga
 "but Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas land equal to the tip of the needle
 usne bhagwaan ko bandi banane kaa asafal prayaas kiya
 God made him interview Vishwaroopa to frighten him
 use hajaaron surya kaa tapan mahasoos hua, karn, dhritarashtra, shakuni, bhishma sab main use krishna dikhne laga tathaa isse vah atyant bhaybheet ho uthaa
 In this way, the Lord made the lucky Duryodhana see the world form
 kurukshetra ke yuddh main arjuna ko bhi prabhu ne vishwaroop se avgat karaayaa
 Arjuna found his own relatives opposite in the war, which led to confusion that he was doing religion that iniquity
 prabhu shri krishna jo unke sarathi ke rup main vahaan upasthit the unhonen arjuna ko bhagavadgita kah sunaaya
 The Lord said, "O Parth! You fear the death of your dear ones, don't you? Listen, only the human body is destroyed, but the soul inside it cannot be burnt by fire or disintegrated by weapons
" jis prakaar maanav vastra badalata he usee prakaar aatma bhi sharir badalati he
 Nain chindanti shastraani nain dahti pavakah
 na channe kledayantyapo na shoshyati marutah
 
 isi prakaar anya gyaan dete hai
 In the 11th chapter of the Gita called Vishwaroop Darshan Yoga, the subject of giving Vishwaroop Darshan to Arjuna by God is explained in detail
 arjuna dwarikadhish se unke adbhut rup ke darshan hetu aagrah karte hai
 Lord Krishna gave a divine look to Arjuna because the vision of this divine form is impossible with ordinary eyes
 bhagwaan ne kaha, "parth! saavdhaan ho jaao
 You look at my many forms, look at the universe, see what you want to see in me, see yourself in me
 " Arjuna saw all kinds of creatures in the world from insects
 bhishma, dron, karn aadi sabhi ko dekha tathaa hajaaron tridevon ko dekha
 Seeing this huge form of Lord Arjuna, he prayed to God to come in quadrilateral form
 arjuna bole "he jagatpita! main aapmen sachrachar brahmad kaa darshan kar rahaa hoon
 i see in you the Brahmins, the Mahadev family and the divine serpent, seated on the monkeys, gods, Kamalasana
 aapako aganit bhujaaon, netron, peton, mukhon vaala dekh rahaa hoon
 o Paratpar Brahm! i do not see your end, nor the middle nor the beginning
 main aapako hajaaron suryon se adhik prakashmay gada, chakra, shankh aadi se yukt dekh rahaa hoon
 i am watching you with the eyes of the sun and the moon, without the beginning and end, saturating the whole world with your sharpness

 Children with mental retardation can be identified with the following symptoms - maansik mandatha hone ke kai sambhavit kaaran ho sakate he, jaise, Mental retardation is a lifelong condition for which no medicines can be discovered for complete treatment, so for its treatment, yadi kisi bachche ko maansik mandatha ho to uske vikaas main mata-pita bahut yogadan de sakate hai, jaise , For the children with mental retardation and their parents, the Government of India has enacted several laws and institutions, under which the child gets a certificate of this condition from the Sadar Hospital in the district

 Many anthropomorphic qualities like mercy, compassion, etc
 are within the limits of natural justice, but the court cannot compel anyone to show mercy

 In the same context, he said that this court will implement the rights prescribed by law, for which the ordinary law of the country is not sufficient
 at: 'suniti' prakritik nyaay kaa vah ansh he, jo nyaayalayon dwaara karyanvit hone yogya rahane par bhi aitihaasik kaarnon se kaaman lau ke nyaayalayon dwaara karyanvit ne hone ke kaaran 'chanceri' nyaayalay dwaara lagu kiya jaataa tha
 Otherwise there is no difference between 'suniti' and 'common Law' in terms of fact
 pracheen kaal main naitikta evam kanoon paraspar mili hue the evam 'dharm' ke vyapak arth main sannihit the
 There are four sources of Hinduism - Veda, Smriti, Virtue and Suniti
 suniti ke siddhant 'nyaay' main antarnihit rahe hai
 In spite of the vivid details of the word of memory and virtue, all the questions of justice have been taken for granted to the accepted rules and fantasies of law and the impression of Suniti on them is clear
 smritikaron ne sweekaar kar liya tha ki sanathan dharm swabhaavat: vyapak nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, the principles of 'justice' have to be implemented in different circumstances

 bharat main angreji shashan sthapit hone par is desh ke nyaayalayon ke nirnay antim apil ke rup main privi council ke adhikarashetra main aane laga
 Thus, the influence of Suniti developed in England began to be reflected in Hindu legislation
 privi council ne kentuva ve girimalpya 519 e, 368 main yah nirnay kiya ki yadi koi kisi kii hatya kar de to vah vyakti mritak kii sampatti kaa adhikari nahin hoga
 The above rule based on public policy was implemented in the case of Hindus from the point of view of justice and Suniti

 Therefore, some words are necessary on the historical development of Suniti in England
 madhya yug main england ke raja kaa sachivalay 'chanceri' kehalaata tha evam uskaa adhikarish 'chancelar' ke naam se vikhyath tha
 The last chance of justice was dependent on the 'chancery' king, despite the courts staying to decide cases in the country
 at: chanceri main bahudhaa aisa aavedan aane laga ki aavedak daridr, vruddh or rugn he; kintu uskaa vipakshi dhani evam shaktishaalee he
 He therefore fears that the opposition will bribe the jury; By his sovereignty he will fear them; Or he has cleverly created a situation that the ordinary court of the country will not be able to give him justice
 aisa aavedan praaia: karun shabdon main bhagwaan or dharm kii duhai It was written by giving chancelar raja ke naam pradesh nikaalkar vipakshi ko apane samaksh upasthit karaane lage

 se chancelar swatantra rup se nirnay dene lage evam chanceri nyaayalay main suniti kaa vikaas yaheen se aarambh hua
 Chancery's popularity began to grow
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki chancelar aise maamalon kaa niraakaran karne lage, jinke liye saadhaaran nyaayalay main koi vidhaan nahin tha
 One can take the trust for illustration
 kramash: chal, durghatana, 'chanceri' dastavej gum hone ke prasang main tathaa vishwasghaat bhi uske adhikaar kshetra main aa gaye
 In the early seventeenth century, a dispute arose between the courts of Chancery and the common law questioning their jurisdiction; But it was finally recognized that the decision of the Court of Chancery would be paramount
 is prasang main yah smaraneey he ki chanceri nyaayalay ne kaaman lau ke nyaayalayon par pratyaksh shashan nahin kiya
 He only guaranteed the successful plaintiff not to implement the immoral decision
 ukt donon prakaar ke nyaayalayon ke vikaas ke saath-saath chancelar ke adhikaar bhi simit hote gaye
 The doctrines of Suniti were based on which rights outside the purview of common law were based and for which diagnosis was required
 san 1873-75 i
 ke abhyantar nirmit kanoon ke dwaara 'suniti' evam kaaman lau kii do vibhinn paddatiyaan ek ho gayi
 As a result, the Courts of Common Law started issuing injunctions and the Chancery Court began to indemnify the ejaculation of the contract, as was not possible in the past
 arthath ab desh ke kisi bhi nyaayalay main kaaman lau evam suniti donon ke nidaan ek saath praapt hone lage
 After 1775 AD, if there is an abnormality between Suniti and Common Law rules in any case, then the law of Suniti will be recognized
 kintu yah smaraneey he ki suniti kaa yah uddeshy nahin tha ki vah desh ke saadhaaran kanoon ko nasht kare, varan uski kabhi kii purti karnaa hi iskaa lakshya tha
 For example, trust injunction, fulfillment of contract, and management of estate of deceased person are contributions of Suniti
 in vishyon ke liye kaaman lau ke nyaayalay main koi nidaan nahin tha
 This rule is the basis of Suniti
 iskaa aashay yah he ki yadi koi harakat aisi he, jiske liye naitik drushti se nyaayalay ko traan dena chahie, to nyaayalay traan avashya degaa
 The Chancery Court began on this basis
 nyaas kaa kanoon is prasang main ek upyukt drushtaant he
 The Samuel Allen & Sons Ltd
 In 1 Chancery 575 a company bought a machine on the condition of rent-purchase
 yah tay hua ki antim kist aada kar dene tak mashin kaa swatvadhikari iskaa vikreta rahegaa evam use adhikaar rahegaa ki vah kist tuutane par mashin ko uthaakar le jaae
 The machine was installed in the company's business house, so the machine was owned by the company by common law
 peeche company ne ukt makaan girvee main ek aise vyakti ko diya, jise mashin se sambandhit 'kiraaya-kharid' kii koi soochna nahin thi
 a case occurred in which the court ruled that the right to take away the machine was equitable title to the land
 chunki kram main isaki sristi pehle hui, at: makaan ke girveedaar ke adhikaar kii apeksha isaki praathamikta he
 If a person builds a house on the belief that the land belongs to him, and the real owner of the land does not make the other person aware of the actual situation even after seeing the house being built, then the real owner of the land, without giving a reasonable price for the house, will be built
 Can't get jis vyakti ne sachche vishwaas se makaan banaaya, uskaa us sampatti par makaan sambandhi kharch ke liye purvadhikaar rahegaa
 a minor took money from the trustee with the intention of cheating him, saying that he was an adult

 When he was an adult, he again asked the trustee for the said amount
 yadhyapi naaballig kii raseed pakki nahin maani jaati, phir bhi nyaayalay ne kaha ki trustee dubaara ukt rakam dene ko jimmedaar nahin he
 Where the claim is too old and neither party has submitted to regain its title and has accepted the opposition's trespass due to its inaction, Suniti will not help in such a situation

 But if the evidence by which the defendant responds to the case is destroyed due to the plaintiff's failure, then the delay will be fatal

 If the property is divided in such a way that a gets one part, b gets five parts and c gets six parts, but c cannot take his part, in such a case, according to accruer clause, C's parts are equally a and b will receive
 arthath prayek ko teen-teen atirikt bhaag milenge evam moulik vibhaajan kii asamanta kii prakalpana lagu nahin hogi, kyonki samta hi suniti he
 This principle is at the core of the trust based on the words of mortgage, penalty, seizure and persuasion
 jab yah prashn uthta he ki koi sampatti rehan main di gai he yaa is vikalp ke saath bech di gai he ki bikri karne vaala ise pun: kharid saktaa he, to aisi sthiti main suniti yah dekhati he ki mulya bikri kii drushti se paryaapt he yaa nahin
 Whether or not the so-called buyer occupied the property
 isi prakaar kisi sanvida main aisi shart rahe ki isaki purti nahin hone par doshi paksh ko puri shaasti deni hogi to suniti yah dekhati he ki shaasti kii rakam sanvida kii purti karaane ke nimitt rakhi gai thi yaa yah kshatipurti kii rakam he
 If the plaintiff has completed his part in a fundamental contract in the belief that the defendant will also complete his part, in such a case the court often orders that the defendant also complete his part as it would be unjust for the defendant not to do so
 isi prakaar yah siddhant samparivartan ke mul main bhi parilakshith hota he
 The background of this theory is historical
 aarambh main chanceri nyaayalay prativaadee kii sampatti main hastkshep nahin karata tha
 Only he was ordered to do justifiable work
 yadi prativaadee aadesh kaa paalan nahin karnaa to nyaayalay use avamaan ke liye dandit karata tha
 His property was also confiscated
 ab bhi suniti kaa mul kshetradhikaar vaadi kii upasthiti par nirbhar he
 If the property of the case is outside the jurisdiction of the court, but the defendant is in the jurisdiction or he can also be summoned for the case and the plaintiff has moral right in the case, then the court will proceed against the defendant
 kintu yadi bhoomi main tittle kaa prashn he tathaa bhoomi nyaayalay ke kshetradhikaar se baahar he to nyaayalay us vishay kaa nirnay nahin karegaa

 tulsi munda bhartiya rajya urisa se ek prakhyat saamaajik kaaryakarta he jise padam shri se 2001 main bharat sarkaar dwaara sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Tulsi Munda did a lot of work to spread literacy among the tribal people
 munda ne urisa ke khanan kshetra main ek vidhyalay sthapit karke bhavishya ke saikadon adivasee bacchon ko shoshit dainik shramik banane se bachaaya he
 As a girl, she herself worked as a laborer in these mines
 yah ek dilachasp tathy he ki jab adivasee bachche apane skulon main jate hai, to ve rajya ke anya hisson main saamaanya vidyalayon main bhaag lene vaale bahut se bacchon se aage nikal jate hai

 tulsi munda ne urisa main mahilaon kii badhati takat kii parighatna ko aage badhaayaa
 Tulsi, who has passed the age of sixty, is known for her mission to spread literacy among the Munda underprivileged
 vinoba bhaave ne jab 1963 main urisa main bhudaan andolan padayatra ke dauraan urisa kaa daura kiya, to usase mulaakaat ne ise us raste par agrasar kar diya jisase unhen apane logon kii kismat ko badalanaa tha
 On that walk, Basil promised Vinoba that she would follow his guidelines and principles throughout her life
 ek saal baad 1964 main acharya ke aadarshon or lakshyon se utsahit or unki saamaajik seva prashikshan se las ho kar usne sarenda main kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Inspired by Vinoba Bhave's ideals, the illiterate Tulsi Munda opened a school for the children of tribal mine workers under a mahua tree
 charity ghar se shuru hoti he, lekin tulsi ne sarenda ko bhi chunaa kyonki "yah behad pichhadaa or garib tha"
 Today his efforts have benefitted not only the villagers of Serenda, where he is based with his tribal development committee, but also the people living around 100 km of this tribal belt
 lokapriy taur par 'tulsipa' ke rup main jaani jaati, usne apni samiti ke tatwadhan main chalaae gaye vidhyalay ke madhyam se kshetra ke puure shaikshik aankadon or saamaajik str ko badal diya he

 " vastav main 'kyonki is ilaake ke bachche din ke dauraan khaanon main kaam karte the ' tulsi ne gaanv mukhi kii madad se ek raat ko chalane vaala vidhyalay shuru kiya
 Then he assured the mine workers to leave their children in his care for the day
 usne unhen swatantraaa andolan or hamaare mahaan vidwaanon or rashtriya netaaon ke kaamon ke bare main kahaniyaan sunaane se shuru kiya
 "I was an illiterate and i knew nothing about bookish, but i came to know about the importance of education and had enough practical knowledge to impart it
 " Tulsi started her school under a mahua tree
 dhan jutaney ke liye 'jo kam aapurti main tha' usne subjiyon or muri ko bechney kaa kaam kiya
 Later when 'he started gaining their trust', the villagers started giving him food and a place to live
 jald hi tulsi ne graminon ko pahaad se pattharon ko kaatane or unhen skool banane main madad karne ke liye raji kiya
 It took six months for the school to be built outside the village
 aaj adivasee vikaas samiti ke paas do thos bhawan hai
 Funds remained a problem for a long time
 tulsi ke paas shikshakon kaa bhugtan karne ke liye koi paisa nahin tha lekin unhone gaanv ke yuvaaon ko ikattha kiya jinhone praathmik str tak adhyayan kiya tha
 “they all came voluntarily
 mere chaatro ne fees dene kii peshkash kii to chijen hal hone lagi - yah mere mishan main ek mile kaa pathar tha
 Donations from large industrial houses and some foreign agencies also started
 " ab wo chatravaas ke liye prati maah 200 rupee kaa shulk leti hai, lekin keval un logon ke liye jo use bhugtan kar sakate hai aaj skool main saat shikshak hai or 81 bacchon ke liye chatravaas kii suvidha vaale 354 chaatr hai

 "we try to give everything to the students" he says
 shikshit karne ke liye apane mishan se aashwast tulsi ko apane adivasee vikaas samiti ke madhyam se anya vikaas kaaryakramon ko karne kii ummid he
 "the first thing i want to do is prevent alcoholism among the tribals - they take Hadiya regularly
 main unki sthiti main sudhaar karne ke bare main charchaa karne or tareeke khojane ke liye gram sabha or mahila sanghathan bhi bananaa chaahati hoon" ve kahati hai
 What about finance? "there are certainly too many financial constraints, even now i cannot pay my school teachers their salaries on time, but i get assistance from foreign agencies and individuals from time to time

 Soil conservation refers to methods that prevent soil from moving from its place
 sansar ke vibhinn kshetron main mrudaa apradan ko rokane ke liye bhinn-bhinn vidhiyaan apanaai gai hai
 The methods of soil conservation are - forest protection, plantation, bonding, land reclamation, flood control, prohibition of excessive grazing, striped and terraced agriculture, contour plowing and cropping
 mrudaa ek bahut hi mahatvapurn sansaadhan he
 It directly or indirectly maintains various types of organisms
 iske atirikt, mrudaa-nirmaan ek bahut hi dhimi prakriya he
 The process of soil erosion has not only destroyed this unique gift of nature but has also created many problems
 mrudaa apradan se baadhen aati hai
 These floods cause major damage to roads and railways, bridges, hydropower projects, water supply and pumping centers
 uparokt vidhiyon kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he: Indiscriminate harvesting of forest trees is the major cause of soil erosion
 vrikshon kii jaden mrudaa padaarthon ko baandhe rakhti hai
 This is the reason why governments have declared forests as 'safe' and prohibited the felling of trees in these forests
 mrudaa sangrakshan kii yah vidhi sabhi prakaar ke bhu-bhaagon ke liye upyukt he
 Forests are called 'messengers' that bring rain
 inase mrudaa nirmaan kii prakriya tej ho jaati he
 Planting trees on river valleys, wastelands and hill slopes is another method of soil conservation
 isse in pradeshon main mrudaa kaa apradan kam ho jaataa hai
 Plantation is an effective way to control wind erosion in the desert frontier areas
 marusthaleey kshetron ke simavarti bhaagon main vriksh lagaakar registani ret ko kheton main jamane se roka ja saktaa he
 In this way the growth of desert areas is controlled
 bharat main, thar marusthal ke vistaar ko rokane ke liye rajasthan, haryana, gujarat tathaa punjab main bade paimaane par vriksh lagaae ja rahe hai
 The amount of water in the rivers increases during the rainy season
 isse mrudaa ke apradan main vruddhi hoti he
 Dams have been built on the rivers for flood control
 inase mrudaa kaa apradan rokane main madad milti he
 Floods can also be prevented by diverting the waters of rivers to drought-prone areas and other well-planned methods of water conservation
 atyadhik charaai se pahari dhaalon kii mri da dhili ho jaati he or jal in dhili mrudaa ko aasaani se baha le jaataa he

 Soil erosion is being prevented by creating a barrier or barrier in the land affected by avanalika erosion
 yah vidhi na keval mrudaa kaa apradan rokatii he, apitu isse mrudaa kii uvarrata banaae rakhane, jal sansadhano ke sangrakshan tathaa bhoomi ko samtal karne main bhi sahaayta milti he
 Another method is to make terraced fields for soil conservation on mountain slopes
 seedhidaar khet banane se taatpary parvatiy pradeshon main dhalaan ke aar-paar samtal chabutare banane se he
 By this method soil erosion in these areas is halted
 saath hi jal sansadhano kaa samuchit upyog bhi hota he
 Thus crops can be grown in these fields
 mrudaa sangrakshan kii yah vidhi tarangit bhoomi vaale pradeshon ke liye sabase adhik upyukt he
 By plowing the land at the same height, plow furrows or drains form across the slope
 isse mrudaa ke apradan kii gati main kami aa jaati he
 This method is also used to maintain soil fertility and humidity
 mrudaa sangrakshan ko yah vidhi marusthaleey or ardhmrusthaleey pradeshon ke tarangit maidaanon ke liye sabase adhik upyukt he
