 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible

 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta

 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities

 At the time when the organization is built, there is no consideration of high or low in the minds of organization makers in relation to different levels
 lekin vibhinn pado ke vetankram, vibhinn staron ke dayitvon kii prakruti tathaa vibhinn prashaskeey staron par karyrat carmikon kii yogyata main antar ke kaaran sanghathan vyavhaar main ucch tathaa nimna yaa adhinsthon ke sambandh viksit ho jate hai

 In this hierarchy, each lower post or level is subject to the higher post nearest to it and above that through that post and similarly to the top post or posts
 padsopan kaa yah maanya siddhanth he ki ucch adhikari neeche ke str par sampark karte samay madhyasth padaadhikari kii upeksha nahin kar saktaa
 Similarly, no lower officer can disregard the arbitral officer while establishing contact with the higher officer
 seedhee par chadhate yaa utarate samay kisi bhi danda ko langhna khatre se khaali nahin hota
 Similarly, crossing any level in administration can also create administrative problems in the organization
 sanghathan main samast carmikon se sadaiv uchit madhyam ke dwaara kaary karneki apeksha kii jaati he
 Whenever a correspondence or file goes on in the organization, it passes through each level while going upwards or downwards
 padsopan kii is kramik prakriya ko 'uchit madhyam' bhi kaha jaataa he
 The term stair is an arrangement with which the functions of various individuals of an organization are linked to each other
 sanghathan main ucch adhikari apane nikatatam adhinsth adhikari yaa karmchaaree ko aadesh detaa he, adhinsth adhikari ucch adhikari ke adeshon kaa paalan karata he
 The following officer can order his nearest officer

 In the organization, a pyramidal pattern of relationships of these higher and subordinates develops
 moonay tathaa raily ne pad sopan ko seedhinuma prakriya yaa seedhinuma siddhanth naam diya he
 Moon and Rally say that wherever there will be a people's organization made up of senior and subordinate relations, the principle of stepping will also apply

 White says - The position ladder is the relation of the senior subordinate generated from many levels of responsibilities from top to bottom, which applies everywhere
 arl latham ke anusaar pad sopan ucch tathaa nimna padon kii aisi suniyojit vyavastha he, jo upar se neeche tak faili hui he
 In this system, the supreme officer, while sitting on his or her feet, can palpate the hearts of the lowest-ranking workers, and can change their activities according to their orders

 According to de Millet, pad sopan is a method in which the efforts of different individuals are interwoven
 moonay tathaa raily ne padsopan vyavastha ko seedhinuma prakriya kaa siddhanth naam diya he tathaa he feol ne ise sopanaatmak shrunkhlaa kaha hai
 According to him, wherever there will be an organization made up of relations of high and subordinates, there will be this stepwise process as well
 kisi bhi sanghathan main kaaryon tathaa uttardayitvon kaa vitaran adi or khadi donon dishaao main hota he
 The vertical division in the organization consists of the positions of the top positions, middle positions and low positions
 jab san gathan main naye pad evam str jode jate hai to yah urdhvadhar vruddhi hoti he, jabaki kshaitijic vibhaajan main pad sopan ke staron main vruddhi kiye bina hi nae nae kaary yaa sthaan jod die jate hai
 In fact, the post-settlement system has to be created due to inequality in salaries, responsibilities, qualifications and status of the personnel

 Although the Allies' ability to produce more than the pivot nation is often attributed to their greater access to natural resources, there were other reasons as well, such as their use of Japan and Germany to use women for work Reluctance, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late tilt towards the war economy
 Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a long war and were not equipped to do so
 apane utpaadan ko badhane ke liye, germany or japan ne lakhon das shramikon kaa istemaal kiya tha;germany ne zyaadatarapurvi europe se lagbhag 12 lakh logon kaa istemaal kiya, jabaki japan nesudur purv asia main 18 lakh se bhi adhik logon ko lagaaya
 In Europe, business came under two very different forms

 Thus, the income from the occupied countries was 40% more than the income collected from Germany's taxation, with the war increasing to about 40% of the total German income

 In contrast to the West, Nazi racial policy encouraged excessive barbarism against the "inferior people" of the Slavic dynasty; in this way mass slaughter was common after most German legacies

 In Asia, Japan referred to the nations under its authority as being part of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Zone, originally a Japanese hegemony that it claimed was for the independence of the colonized people

 There were two significant additional roles for the aircraft, the airlift - high priority supplies, the ability to quickly move equipment and personnel, albeit in limited quantities; And strategic bombing - using targeted bombs against civilian areas in hopes of disrupting enemy industry and morale

 At sea, though there was advancement in almost all aspects of naval warfare, the two primary focal points of development were aircraft carriers and submarines
 Although aerial warfare was relatively successful at the start of the war, operations on Toronto, Pearl Harbor, the South China Sea, and the Coral Sea soon established the aircraft carrier as a main battleship in place of warships

 In addition to increasing their effectiveness, aircraft carriers were more economical than battleships due to their relatively low g cost and the need for them not to be heavily armored
 The Pandubbis, whose practice proved to be quite effective in the World War, were anticipated by all sides to be significant in the other
 british ne pandubbi virdohi hathiyaaroor ranneeti, jaise sonar or raksha dal, par vikaas ko kendrit kiya; jabaki germany ne isaki diginon ke saath aakraamak kshamta main sudhaar laane par dhyaan kendrit kiya, jaise kii tap VII pandubbi or volf pack ranneeti

 By the late 1930s, the design of the tank had become far more advanced in all respects than in World War I, and the development continued throughout the war — in speed, armor, and firepower
 At the outset of the war, considerable armies considered the tank to be the best weapon against them and developed tanks with specific objectives to this effect
 soch kii is disha ko lagbhag nakaar diya gaya tha
 The reason for this was the poor performance of relatively light early tank armaments against armor, and the principle of avoiding tanks from Germany tanks; The use of combined arms by Germany, along with the former factor, was one of the main reasons for the highly successful stormy shelling strategy in Poland and France
 tinkon ko nasht karne ke anekon tareekon, jiname shaamil the apratyaksh topakhane, tanks virdohi bandooken, khaane, kam duuri ke paidal sena ke tanks virdohi hathiyaar or anya tinkon kaa upyog kiya gaya tha
 Despite the large scale mechanization of the various armies, the infantry still remained the backbone of all forces and throughout the war most infantry equipment was the same as that used in the First World War

 Some of the earliest developments included the widespread combination of portable machine guns and numerous submachine guns
 The Assault rifle, a development in the first half of the war, included the highest qualities of the rifle and submachine guns, almost all military
 Became the main weapon of the infantry of the forces
 sanchaar ke kshetra main, gumelekhan badi badi kuta kitabon ke istemaal se utpann jatilta or suraksha kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye pramukh yoddaon ne anekon prakaar kii bijlekh mashiinon kaa nirmaan kiya
 The most famous of these was the Enigma machine of Germany
 SIGINT was the countering process of decryption, notable examples of which being the breaking of the Japanese naval code by the British ULTRA and the Allies
 Another important aspect of military espionage was the use of false operations, which the Allies successfully used very effectively on many occasions, such as the Meansmeat and Bodiegard operations, in which the Allies invaded Sicily and Normandy from the Germans, respectively Meditations and armies were diverted away
