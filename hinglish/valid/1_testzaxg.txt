 Their role is so important that they either initiate the chemical reactions of the body or increase their speed
 inkaa utpreran kaa gun ek chakree prakriya he
 Like all catalysts, fermentation also acts to reduce the catalytic energy of the reaction, resulting in an increase in the reaction speed
 adhikansh prakinwan abhikriyaayein anya gaiyr-utprerit abhikriyaaon kii tulana main lakhon guna tej gati se hoti hai
 Similarly, like all other catalytic reactions, fermentation does not consume in the reaction, nor does the reaction change the equilibrium

 There are generally three types of reactions with substrates
 sabstrate kaa anukulan tab hota he, jab prakinv sabstrate anuon ke saath kriya kar unke saath rasinic sambandh banaate hai
 In this, the fermentation reacts with the substrate and breaks down its molecules
 sabstrate ke saath kriya kar enzim usamen rasinic parivartan karata he or anuon ke electron kii sthiti main parivartan kar detaa he
 Due to this, the molecules are able to form relationships with the remaining molecules
 prakinv jab sabstrate ke sampark main aate hai to un par gadde ban jate hai
 Substrates react chemically with these pits and come into chemical form when exposed to fermentation

 Although now steam-powered trains and other machines have faded, almost half of the world's electric power is still being generated with the help of steam turbines
 bhaap ingine banane ke ytn kaa sabase pracheen ullekh alexandria ke hero ke lekhon main miltaa he
 Hero was a member of the famous Alexandrian sect schwör bei koran which included masters of erstwhile sciences such as Ptolemy, Euclid, Eratosthenes
 hero ne apane lekh main ek aisi yukti kaa varnan kiya he jisamen ek band baks main vaayu garm kii jaati thi or ek nalee ke maarg se neeche pani bhare bartan kii ore failati thi
 The water of the vessel used to flow into the second tube and it became a fake shower
 phir iske baad is sambandh main kahin koi vivaran nahin miltaa he
 In 1606 AD, some 2,000 years from Hero, Marquesave della Porta, founder of Napoleon's Academy and then a pioneer of science in Europe, used steam instead of air in Hero's sprinkling experiment
 unhone yah bhi sujhaayaa ki kisi bartan ko pani se bharne ke liye yadi use ek nalee dwaara pani se kisi talab se sambandhit kar diya jaay or tab us bartan main bhaap bharkar phir use upar se pani ke dwaara thanda kiya jaay to bheetar kii bhaap sanghanit hokar nirvaat utpann karegi or uski jagah talab se pani bartan main bhar jayega
 In 1698, this suggestion of Marquesve della Porta was used by Thomas Savory in a water dispenser
 is prakaar severy pehla vyakti tha jisane vyavsaayik upyog kaa ek bhaap ingine banaaya, jiskaa upyog khadaanon main se pani ulichane or kuon main se pani nikaalane main hua

 By repairing it, Watts noticed that the fuel wasted badly
 vichaarsheel swabhaav ke wat ne isse shreshth mashin banane kaa vichaar prarambh kar diya
 In this way, he made many discoveries and instruments, from which the steam engine got its present form and became a powerful instrument in the progress of industry and civilization
 bhaap ingine ke nimnlikhit mukhya prakaar hai : In a single-engine engine, the steam acts on one side of the piston and in the two-way engine the steam works on both sides of the piston
 yadi in donon prakaar ke injanon main anya sabhi avasthaaen samaan hon, to dvikriya ingine dwaara praapt shakti duusare prakaar ke ingine dwaara praapt shakti kii dooni hoti he
 This is the reason that an action engine is rarely used these days
 silinder kii dhuree ke urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij hone ke anusaar ingine urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij kaha jaataa he
 The horizontal engine occupies more space than the vertical engine
 urdhwadhar prakaar ke ingine main gharshan aadi kam hota he, jiske kaaran yah kshaitij ingine kii tulana main adhik din tak chal saktaa he
 The speed of a steam engine is in fact its crank shaft rotation per minute
 chaar foot piston stroke evam 80 parikraman prati mintewale ingine main ausat piston chaal 640 foot prati minute hogi
 This engine will be called the low speed engine
 saadhaarant: 100 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se kam chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko nimna chaal ingine kehete hai evam 250 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se adhik chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko ucch chaal ingine kehete hai
 An engine running between 100 and 250 revolutions per minute is called a "medium speed engine"
 ucch chaal ingine kii sabase bada gun yah he ki samaan shakti ke liye yah bahut hi chote aakaar kaa hota he
 Steam is also less expensive due to the high speed, as heat transfer between steam and cylinder takes a very short time in this type of engine

 After working steam in the condensing engine, it enters the condenser and converts it into water at atmospheric pressure there
 sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karne se bhaap adhik kaary kar paati he
 In simple engines, each cylinder receives steam directly from the boiler and exhales directly into the atmosphere or condenser
 sanyoji ingine main bhaap ek silinder main, jise ucch daab silinder kehete hai, kuch had tak prasaarit hoti he or uske baad usase kuch bade silinder main, jise nimna daab silinder kehete hai, pravesh karti he evam yahan prasar kii kriya purna hoti he
 Often the low pressure cylinder exits the condenser
 prasar teen yaa chaar silinder main bhi ho saktaa he evam in injanon ko triprasar ingine yaa chatushprasar ingine kehete hai
 The heat engine has the maximum efficiency / T1 with T1 and T2 being the maximum and minimum temperatures in the heat engine cycle
 isse pataa chalata he ki ingine kii dakshata in donon tapon par nirbhar karti he
 The efficiency of the steam engine will increase as the value of it increases and the value of it decreases
 ke mulya ko badhaane ke liye byler se nikal kar ingine main aanevaali bhaap kii daab ko badhanaa hoga, kyonki bhaap kii daab jitani hi adhik hogi kaa mulya utana hi badhegaa
 There is another way to increase
 vah he bhaap ko atitapit karnaa
 The superheat of steam is increased by treating the superheat in the boiler
 ke maan ko kam karne ke liye sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The condenser is converted into steam water by cold water
 at: achche sanghnitr main kaa maan thande jal ke taap ke baraabar ho saktaa he
 This suggests that the engine will be more efficient by having more pressure in the steam engine and the work done by the superheated steam and converting the steam to water at a temperature equal to the temperature of the cold water obtainable in the condenser
 boyler se bhaap ucch daab par bhapapeti main pravesh karti he
 As soon as the piston reaches the end of the stroke, at the same time the valve moves, in which the steam opens and the steam enters the cylinder
 bhaap kii daab dwaara dhakka die jane se piston aage badhata he
 This is called front stroke
 piston kii chaal dwaara crank, crank shaft evam utkendrak chalate hai
 The entrance of the fender opens the door a bit more
 silinder main bhaap tab tak pravesh karti rahati he jab tak dwaar ekadam band nahin ho jaataa
 At this time, there is a breakup and after this the steam is not stored in the cylinder
 silinder main ai hui bhaap ab prasaarit hoti he evam is prasar main bhaap kaa aaytan bad jaataa he evam daab kam ho jaati he
 Steam works at similar times
 agr stroke ke ant main valve bhapadwar ko nikaas kii ore khol detaa he, jisase bhaap nirmukt hoti he
 The pressure of the ejected steam becomes equal to the back pressure
 nirmochan hone ke kuch kshan ke baad piston peeche kii ore lautataa he evam ise prayaavartan stroke kehete hai
 The piston exhausts the remaining steam in the cylinder while returning to this stroke
 jab piston is stroke ke ant par pahunchataa he, valve nikaas dwaar ko band kar detaa he, jisase bhaap kaa pravaah band ho jaataa he
 There is some steam left between the cylinder top and the piston, which is not released
 phir chakra kii punrariti hoti he
 In this two-way engine, the action of the same chakra is on the other side of the cylinder
 rankin chakra ek saidhantik chakra he, jiske anusaar bhaap ingine kaary karata he
 The main function of the speed regulator is to regulate the speed of the engine
 bhaap ingine ke gati-niamak in do tareekon main se ek hi sahaayta se paribhraman kii gati sthir rakh paata he: The speed regulator, which regulates engine speed by increasing or decreasing the pressure of steam according to the demand of power, is called a barrier regulator
 gatiniamak ek avrodh valve ko chalaata he, jo mukhya bhaap nalee main rakhaa hota he
 In this type of gait regulator, the main motile condyle is the motile regulator
 valve santulit prakaar kaa hota he, arthath bhaapadaab dwaara parinami bal shunya hota he
 When the engine speed increases, the speed of the revolutions of the accelerating condensates also increases, which increases the centrifugal force
 bal kii yah vruddhi unhen gurutvkarshnabal evam niyantran kamaani ke viruddh baahar chalane kaa baadhya karti he
 This causes the valve to close in part
 valve dwaara avrodh hone par piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main kami ho jaati he, jiske kaaran utpann shakti bhi kam ho jaati he
 And as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and the pressure of the steam acting on the piston increases, which in turn increases the speed to normal speed
 But it comes
 avrodh gati-niamak dwaara niyamit bhaap ingine main prayog ke baad yadi ingine main prati ghante vyavahrut bhaap kii taul ko ashwashakti ke saath aankaa jaae, to ek saral rekha praapt hogi

 albert oinstin kaa janm germany main wootemberg ke ek yahudee parivaar main hua
 His father was an engineer and salesman
 unki maan paulin oinstin thi
 Although Einstein had difficulty speaking initially, he topped the studies
 unki maatrubhaasha german thi or baad main unhone italvi or angreji bhi sikhi
 In 1880 his family moved to the city of Munich, where his father and uncle jointly opened a company called "electrotechnic Frébich J
 Einstein & See", which manufactured electrical appliances
 or isane munich ke Oktoberfest meley main pehali baar roshni kaa prabandh bhi kiya tha
 His family did not believe in Jewish religious traditions, and for this reason Einstein could go to Catholic school
 apni maan ke kehane par unhone sarangi bajaanaa siikhaa
 He did not like this and later abandoned it, but later he enjoyed Mozart's Sarangi music
 1894 main, unke pita kii company ko munich shahar main vidyut prakaash vyavastha ke liye aapurti karne kaa anubandh nahin mil sakaa
 Due to the loss, he had to sell his company
 vyapaar kii talash main, oinstin parivaar italy chale gaye, jahaan ve sabase pehle milan or phir kuch maheene baad pavia shahar main bas gayi
 Even after the family left for Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to complete his studies
 disambar 1894 ke ant main, unhone pavia main apane parivaar se milane italy kii yatra kii
 During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay titled "examining the state of the ether in a magnetic field"
 apane puure jeevankaal main, oinstin ne saikadon kitaaben or lekh prakashit kiye
 He published more than 300 scientific and 150 non-scientific research papers
 1965 ke apane vyaakhyaan main, oppenheimar ne ullekh kiya ki oinstin ke praarambhik lekhan main kai trutiyon hoti thi jiske kaaran unke prakaashan main lagbhag das varshon kii deree ho chuki thi: " ek aadmi jiskaa trutiyon ko hi sahi karne main ek lanbaa samay lage, kitna mahaan hoga"
 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more
 
 Anus Mirabilis Papers is related to four articles that Einstein published in 1905 in a scientific journal called Onlen der Physik, which included photoelectric effects, Brownian motion, special relativism, and e = mc2
 in chaar lekhon ne aadhunik bhautikee kii neenv ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he or antariksh, samay tathaa dravya par logo kii soch ko badla he
 These four papers are: san 1900 main onalen der physic ko prastut, oinstin ke pehla shodh-patr "keshika aakarshan" par tha
 It was published in 1901 with the title "extracts from capillary phenomena"
 1902-1903 main prakashit do patron main parmanuviya ghatana kii vyakhya, sankhyikeey ke madhyam se karne kaa prayaas kiya
 This paper formed the foundation for a 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian motion can be used as concrete evidence for the presence of molecules
 1903 or 1904 main unka shodh mukhya rup se, prasar ghatana par parimit parmaanu aakaar kaa asar par sambandhit rahe
 He expressed the principle of relativity
 jo ki harman minkovski ke anusaar antariksh se antariksh-samay ke bich baari-baari se parivartanheenata ke samanyikaran ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Other theories that Einstein coined and later proved to be correct included the principle of equality and the theory of temperate normalization of quantum numbers
 oinstin ke "chalit nikaayon ke bijli kaa gativigyaan par" shodh-patr 30 june 1905 ko purna hua or usee varsh kii 26 sitambar ko prakashit hua
 This establishes harmony between Maxwell's equation of electricity and magnetism and the theory of mechanics, after major changes in mechanics close to the speed of light
 yahi baad main oinstin ke saapekshata ke vishesh siddhant ke rup main janaa gaya
 The conclusion was that, in the time-space structure, the moving matter is seen as slow and narrow, when it is measured in the observer's frame
 is shodh-patr main yah bhi tark diya ki luminipheras ether kaa vichaar zarurat se zyaada tha
 In his paper on mass-energy equivalence, Einstein constructed e = mc2 from special relativity equations
 1905 se oinstin kaa saapekshata main shodh kai varshon tak vivaadaaspad bana rahaa, halaaki ise kai agrani bhautikavidon jaise kii maiks plank dwaara sweekaara bhi gaya
 In a 1905 paper, Einstein explained that light itself is made up of local particles
 oinstin ke prakaash quanta pariklpana ko maiks plank or niles bor sahit lagbhag sabhi bhautikavidon, ne asweekaar kar diya
 This hypothesis was universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Mulliken's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and the Compton scattering measurements
 oinstin ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aavriti kii prayek lahar, urja ke prayek photonon ke sangrah ke saath judaa hota he 
 He did not say more about this, because he was not sure how particles are related to waves
 lekin unhone suzav diya kii he,ki is pariklpana ko kuch prayogtmak parinaamon dwaara samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai jise hi baad main vishesh rup se prakashavidyut prabhaav kaha gaya
 In 1907, Einstein proposed a model that each atom oscillates independently in a lattice structure
 oinstin model main, prayek parmaanu swatantra rup se dolan karata he oinstin ko pataa tha ki vaastavik dolanon kii aavriti alag hoti hai lekin phir bhi is siddhant kaa prastaavit kiya, kyonki yah ek spasht pradarshan tha ki kaise kwantum yantriki, parmparik yantriki main vishisht garmi kii samasya ko hal kar saktaa hai
 Peter debai refined this model
 1910 ke dashak ke dauraan, alag-alag pranaaliyon ko kwantum yantriki ke daayre main laane ke liye iskaa vistaar hua
 Following the discovery of Ernest Rutherford's nucleus, and the proposition that electrons revolve around planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the discrete motion of electrons in atoms of elements by quantum mechanical, initiated by Planck and developed by Einstein And the periodic table of the elements can be explained
 1898 ke wilhem viena ke tark ko iske saath jod kar oinstin ne iske vikaas main yogadan diya
 Vienna showed that, by the hypothesis of a thermodynamic variability of a thermal equilibrium state, all black rotations at different temperatures can be derived from each other by a simple transfer process
 1911 main oinstin ne yah paaya kii vahi samoshna siddhant yah dikhaata hai kii maatra jo kisi bhi yantric gati main pramaathran he ko ek sthiroshm aparivartaneey hona chahie
 Arnold Summerfield identified temperate invertebrates as dynamic variables in traditional mechanics
 is siddhant ke anusaar- Albert Einstein has made a huge contribution in this subject
 yatra karte samay, oinstin ne apni patni elsa tathaa dattak putree kadamuni margot or ilse ke liye patr likhaa karte the
 These letters can be found at The Hebrew University
 margot oinstin ne in nijee patron ko janata ke liye uplabdh karaane kii anumati de di thi, lekin saath hi yah anurodh kiya ki uski mrityu ke bees saal baad tak aisa nahin kiya jaye
