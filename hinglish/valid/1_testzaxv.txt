kuch gair pathan log bhi pathaanon ke prbhaav main aakar pakhtunavali kaa paalan karte hai
 It is a code of conduct that guides individual life as well as social life
 pashtunavali bahumat pathaanon dwaara paalan kii jane vaali aachaar samhita he
 There is no harm in saying that as long as Pathan kept following Pakhtunvali, he ruled the world and was never defeated by anyone
 bharat main jab unhone pakhtunavali kaa paalan karnaa band kar diya tab ve jat maraathon, mughalo angrezon sabhi se parajeet hote gayi, zaleel hue, va mufalisi ne unhen aa gheraa
 It has been said earlier that the Pakhtuns are from Israel
 yah khuda kii chuni hui qaom he
 The principles of Pakhtunwali are based on the Taurat of Musa Alaihissalam
 isamen vah ahad shaamil he jo khuda ne bani israel se baandha tha
 When the Israelites fulfill their promise, God will also fulfill the promise he made to the Israelites
 jaisaa ki quran shareef main bhi aayaa he ki i bani israel tum apana vah vaada puraa karo jo tumne mujh se kiya tha, taaki main apana vah vaada puraa karun jo maine tum se kiya tha
 The Pakhtuns have also kept a record of their five thousand year history
 pakhtunavali aatm sammaan, azaadi, nyaay, mehmaannawaazi, pyaar, maaf kar dena, badla lenaa, sahansheeltaa aadi ko badhaava dene vaali aachaar samhita he
 This is all for everyone, including strangers and foreigners, irrespective of their caste, religion, faith, nationality
 pashtunavali kaa paalan karnaa vaa isaki hifaazat karnaa har ek pathan kii vyaktigat zimmedaari he
 Main Principles Some of the main principles of Pakhtunavali are as follows
 1
 melmestiyansnelmstia – dayaa, meharbaani va mehmaannawaazi sabhi paradesiyon va ajanabiyon par dikhaaya janaa
 There should be no discrimination on the basis of religion, caste, ethnic nationality etc
 yah sab bagair kisi inaam yaa badale main kuch milegaa aisi ummid ke kiya janaa chaiye
 The guest reception of Pashon is famous worldwide
 2
 nanavatai:- Nanawatai – agar koi apane dushmano se bachaane ke liye madad va sangrakshan maange to unhen sangrakshan diya janaa chaiye
 They are protected at all costs
 un logon ko bhi jo kaanoon se bhaag rahe hon us samay takh sangrakshan diya janaa chaiye jab tak ki vastusthiti saafe nahin ho jaati
 They are also protected when the defeated side goes to the winner
 kai maamalon main aatm samarpan karke apane dushman ke hi ghar main sharan lee jaati he
 3
 Change - blood for blood, eye for eye, tooth for tooth
 aisa patit hota he ki yah maaf kar dene, dayaa karne ke siddhanth ke vipareet he
 But due to such lack of understanding, wrong fahmings arise
 maafi ke liye zaruri he, ki galati karne vaala aafi maange
 How sorry without asking? It is applicable to all types of crimes and crimes
 chaahe galat kaam kal kiya gaya tha, chaahe ek hazaar saal pehle kiya gaya ho
 If the wrongdoer is not alive then he will be avenged from the one who is close to his blood
 4
 tureh Tureh –ek pathan ne apni zamin, sampatti, parivaar striyaan aadi kii hifaazat bahaduree se ladaai lard kar kerani chaiye
 This Pashtun is the responsibility of both men and women
 iske liye usne maut ko bhi yadi gale lagane kii zarurat pade to maut ko gale laga lenaa chaiye
 5
 Sabat Sabat - Every one should be loyal to his family, friends, clan, etc
 sabaat yaa vafadaari behad zaruri he va ek pathan kabhi bhi bewafaa nahin ho saktaa
 6
 Honesty Imandari - a Pakhtun must always think good things, speak good things, do good deeds
 pakhtun ne sabhi cheezon kaa sammaan karnaa chaiye jisamen log, jaanavar va pryaavaran bhi shaamil he
 Destroying them is against Pakhtunvali
 7
 isteqaamat Isteqamat – khuda par vishwaas karnaa
 In Pashto, God is called, Allah in Arabic and Whagwan in Hindi

 Believing that God is one, He has created all the things of the whole world
 yah yahaan hazaar saal purana pakhtunavali kaa siddhanth islam ke tauhid ke samakaksh he
 8
 Gharat: - Ghayrat - Pakhtun should always maintain his human dignity and preserve it

 unhone khud apana bhi sammaan karnaa chaiye va dusron kaa bhi sammaan karnaa chaiye namoos Namus – ek pathan ne pathan striyon va ladakiyon ke sammaan kii raksha har qeemat par kerani chaiye

 Even it is a bond to him that he must do so
 chaahe vah pathan stri ho yaa pathan purush
  Fulfilling promises: - a real Pathan will never fulfill his promises
  ekta va barabari:- chaahe ve koi bhi bhashaa bolte hon, chaahe kisi bhi qabeele ke hon, chaahe garib hon yaa amir, chaahe kitna hi rupaya unke paas ho, pakhtunavali sari duniya ke pakhtunon yaa pathaanon ko ek sutara ben baandhti he
 Every human being is equal, this was the basic principle of Pashtunvali
  sune jane kaa adhikaar:- chaahe ve koi bhi bhashaa bolte hon, chaahe kisi bhi qabeele ke hon, chaahe garib hon yaa amir, chaahe kitna hi rupaya unke paas ho har ek ko yah adhikaar praapt he ki uski baat samaaj main va jirga main suni jaye
  Family and Faith: - To believe that each and every Pakhtun is a brother and sister of other Pakhtuns, even if the Pakhtuns are divided into 1 thousand tribes
 pakhtun ek parivaar he, unbhein anya pakhtun pariwaron ke striyon, betiyon, bde buzurgon, mata- pita, beton, va patiyon kaa khyaal rakhana chaiye
  Support: - The poor and the weak should be helped in such a way that no one knows
  ilm yaa gyaan praapt karnaa:- pakhtun ne zindagi, itihaas, vigyaan, sabhyataa samskruti aadi ke bare main lagaataar apana gyaan badhaate rahane kii koshish karte rahanaa chaiye
 Pakhtun should always keep his mind open to new ideas
  buraai ke kilaaf lado:- achchhai va buraai ke bich ek lagaataar jang jari he, pakhtun ne jahaan kahin bhi vah buraai dekhe to uske kilaaf ladanaa chaiye
 This is his duty

 In the event of any kind of foreign attack Pakhtun should defend his country Pakhtunkhwa
 desh kii hifaazat se taatpary sabhyataa samskruti, paramparaayen, jivan mulya aadi kii hifaazat karne se he
  Dod Pasabani: - It is binding on Pakhtoon to protect Pakhtoon civilization and culture
 pashtunavali yah salaah detii he ki isko safaltaapurvak karne ke liye pakhtun ne pashto zabaan kabhi nahin chhodana chaiye

 is lekh ko sudhaalekh pariyojna ke tahat apana vartmaan swaroop mila hai 
 Its references were improved to "do you know"
 ab maine isamen thodaa or vistaar kara hai or mujhe lagata hai ki ye thode or sudhaar ke pashchaat nirvaachit lekh ban saktaa hai

 The article is well organized, and is divided into several subtitles
 saath hi sari vikipriyojnaon main se, is vishay par likhaa gaya sabase shreshth lekh he
 i understand that it has all the qualities of becoming an elected article, or it should be changed to make it an elected article
 yah lekh isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kayuki yah bharat ko videsh raaket se savatantraaa dilaayegaa or bhavishya main isi raaket dwaara bharat ke antarikshayatri ko antariksh main bheja jaayegaa

 There are many shortcomings in the article and it still has to go a long way in becoming an elected article
 lekin yah baat avashya he ki is lekh main nirvaachit lekh banane kii sabhi sambhaavnaayen maujuud hai
 In the elected article, there is also a discussion of fine mistakes, that is, the hair also has to be removed
 saamanytah vivechna ke samay lekh ke prastaavak ko feedback diya jaataa he, or prastaavak hi lekh main parivartan karata he taaki vah is prakriya se avgat ho sake or bhavishya main swayan vivechna kar sake, lekin is lekh main mujhe lagata he ki feedback dene ke sathsath hamen swayan bhi haath bantaana hoga kyonki abhi bahut kamiyaan hai
 Different names have been written in the role itself, Mark 3, MK 3, III etc
, i am giving all these arranged in the role, do it in the rest of the article

, many information are not matching with the article such as first stage thrust etc
 ek aam pathak hone ke naate main kai jaankariyaan chaahungaa jo lekh main anuplabdh hai - jaise ki S-200 kya he? udaan pareekshan main likhaa he - parachute khul jaataa he, kya yahan parachute khul gaye-esa nahin hona chahie? yahan gundharm bataae ja rahe hai yaa pareekshan kaa yah parinaam bataaya ja rahaa he-spasht nahin he

 bharat kaa ek anya prachlit naam hindustan he, arthath "hinduon kii bhoomi"
 Hinduism has evolved systematically since about 5000 years and can be seen as seven stages that binoculars are in each other
 kuch hindutv ke adhivaktaaon kaa maananaa hoga ki 12,000 saal pehle himyug ke ant tak hindu dharm ko apane sampurna rup main rishiyon ke liye prakat kiya gaya tha
 In the history of Hindutva, mythology is just history from time to time, historians cannot or cannot count
 haal ke dinon main, hindu dharm ko "khulaa strot dharm" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, anokhaa he ki isamen koi paribhaashit sansthaapak yaa siddhant nahin he, or aitihaasik or bhugolic vaastaviktaaon ke jawaab main iske vichaar lagaataar viksit hote hai
 It is best described as a river with many tributaries and branches, one of the Hindutva branches, and is currently very powerful, with many considering themselves as a river

 This aspect of inviting the gods and receiving favor from them continues to this day, although these rituals vary
 vedon ne sindhu se apper ganga or nichle ganga maidaanon main ek kramik failaav prakat kiya he
 Some Hindutva scholars refute such geographical spread and insist on the subcontinent to have advanced, such as fully developed, homogenous, urban Vedic culture, plastic surgery and even airplanes since ancient times

 This phase saw the rise of shamanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism, its followers spoke in Pali and Prakrit and also rejected the Vedic form and the Vedic language, Sanskrit
 isamen brahman pujaariyon ne bhi dharm-shastron kii rachana ke madhyam se vaidic vichaaron ko punargathit kiya, kitaaben jo ki shaadi ke madhyam se saamaajik jivan ko viniyamit karne or paarit hone ke anushthan par dhyaan kendrit karti hai, or logon ke dayitvon ko unke purvajon, unki jati or vishwa par nirbhar karata he

 Some Hindutva scholars say that there was no separate Tamil Sangam culture
 yah puri tarah se viksit, samroop, shahari vaidic samskruti kaa hissaa tha, jahaan sabhi ne sanskrit ko bolaa tha
 The fourth phase saw the rise of writings such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Purana, which began 2,000 years ago, where stories are used to reconcile the worldview of domestic and world relations and create the now familiar Hindu worldview
 hamen ek puri tarah se viksit puranic kathaon ke liye pesh kiya jaataa he jahaan vishwa kii koi shuruyaat nahin he yaa ant, kai akaash or kai hello ke saath, kriya or pratikriya dwaara niyantrit, jahaan sabhi samaaj janm or mrityu ke chakron ke madhyam se jate hai, bas sabhi jivit praaniyon kii tarah is charan main mandiron or mandir anushthanon kaa udai hua
 We also see the rise of the monastic Vedantic orders that corrupt the body and everything sensory, as well as the Jap tantric orders, corrupting the body and exploring the body and all things
 ham puraane nigama parampara ke mingling bhi dekh sakate hai, jahaan divyata ko nae agma parampara ke saath niraakaar mana jaataa he, jahaan paramatma shiv or uske putron, vishnu or unke avatar, or devi or uske kai roopon kaa rup lete hai
 With the emergence of new orders and traditions, we also see consolidation of the caste system, which is not a community group based on occupations, which distinguishes itself from not being interim
 kai shikshavidon ne jati ko hindu dharm kii ek aavashyak visheshta ke rup main dekha he jo ucch jatiyon ke paksh main he, jis par aarope he ki hindutv asweekaar karte hai
 Many Hindutva scholars maintain that caste has a scientific and rational basis, and has nothing to do with politics or economics
 paanchvaan charan 1,000 varsh purana he, or yah ek siddhant ke rup main bhakthi kaa udai dekha, jahaan bhakt bhavuk geeton ke madhyam se devataaon se jude hue hai, jo kshetreey bhashaaon main bana he, aksar mandir pranali ko darkinar karte hai
 This was a time when a rigid caste hierarchy firmly asserted itself, based on the principle of holiness and some castes being viewed as inauspicious and inept
 unhen bhi samudaay se acchhee tarah se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa he yah bhi vah samay he jab islam bharat main pravesh karata he, shantipurvak samudr ke vyapaariyon ke madhyam se dakshin main or madhya asian saradaaron ke madhyam se hinsak rup se uttar main jaataa he, jo buddha mathon or hindu mandiron ko nasht karte hai, jo raajnneetik satta ke centre bhi hote hai or antat unke shashan kii sthapana karte hai, aksar hindu raajaaon jaise uttar main rajput, purab main ahoms, maraathon or dakkan main vijaynagar samrajya kaa virodh karte the
 Hindutva saw the arrival of Islam and the rise of the Delhi and Deccan Sultanates, the latter marking the end of Mughal rule as the end of great Hindu culture, a subject that Marxist historians have made crazy communal propaganda
 baad main keval hindu-islamic sahyog ko ujagar kiya gaya, jo anya charam par ja rahaa he, gaiyr-marxvaadi itihaaskaaron kaa tark he The sixth phase is 300 years old when Hinduism answers the rise of European power in the subcontinent, and the resulting arrival of Christian missionaries and rational scientific discourse
 kuch hindutv vidwaan, donon ke bich antar nahin karte hai
 European scholars in this era tried to make sense of Hinduism using both scientific methods and a judeo-christian lens
 unke liye, akeshwarwad sachcha dharm or vaigyanik tha; bahudevvaad murtipujak puranic kathaon tha unhone hindu jivan style ke anuwaad or dastavejikaran kaa ek vishaal abhyaas shuru kiya
 He sought a holy book, a prophet, and more importantly, a purpose
 aakhirkaar, jatilta ko vyavasthit karne ke liye, unhone hindu dharm ko brahmanwad ke rup main paribhaashit karnaa shuru kiya, yah buddha dharm, jain dharm or sikh dharm se bhinn tha
 This orientalist framework continues to inform the global understanding of Eastern religions through schools, colleges and media
 ek taral maukhik samskruti ko 1 9veen shatabdi tak tay kiya gaya tha
 Hindus studying in Western ways felt a deep impact of shame and shame when asked about their customs and beliefs
 kuch ne aupniveshik dekhne ke liye hindutv ko sudhaarney kaa faisla kiya
 Others rejected the "true essence" of Hinduism and rejected "later corrupt" practices
 phir bhi dusron ne hindu dharm ko hi khaarij kar diya or sabhi dharmon ko ek andhere khatarnaak bal ke rup main dekha, jo tarksangatta or vaigyanik rup se badal diya gaya
 It is at this stage that Hindutva emerged as a counter-power that he saw in Europe as an indestructible and unfair mockery of all things Hindu and later challenged in American and Indian universities
 hindutv ne marxvad or anya sabhi pashchimi pravachanon ko isai pravachan ke ek or rup ke rup main dekha, jo pichley shatabdiyon main islam ne madhya or dakshin purv asia main jo kiya tha, vah hindu jivan style ke sabhi nishaanon ko mitaa dene kii maang kar rahaa tha
 The seventh phase, post-independence, cannot be ignored, even if it extends only to the last 70 years, as it begins with violent and blood-soaked divisions on religious grounds and the creation of East and West Pakistan for Muslims
 
 kya yah bharat ko mul rup se ek hindu rajya bana detaa he? yaa kya yah "bharat ke vichaar" ko prerit karata he jahaan sabhi logon ko samaan sammaan miltaa he, chaahe dharm or jati kaa? alag-alag log alag-alag jawaab denge
 Hindutva saw secularism as minority disciplinary, positive discrimination as a counterrevolution of specific castes, socialism as just angry capitalism, the creation of gender equality by threatening the principles of social justice and traditional Hindu family values, and the Uniform Civil Code Another way of dividing India as an absence of
 kai buddhijiviyon ne jab unka tark diya ki hindu dharm or bharat jaisi avadharanaen british kii rachana thim, to koi vaastavik pracheen jadon ke saath, aam janata kii aasthaa ko kalpit kalpanaaon ke vipareet ke rup main asweekaar kar diya gaya tha
 It became worse when academics around the world equated terrorism with racism, denying Islam with terrorism, or denying Christianity with terrorist missionary activity
 bahut se logon ne marxvad, udaarvaad or dharmanirpekshata ke siddhant ko bahusankhya bharatiyon main vifal kar diya, jinamein se zyaadaatar garibi garibi main rah rahe hai
 Fair or not, the victim felt it was time to give Hindutva an opportunity despite its aggressively masculine stance, especially since it spoke of the language of development, and aspirations
 bharat kii janaganana 2011 ke anusaar bharat kii hindu aabaadi neeche di gai he
 In the period 1991–2001, Manipur has witnessed the greatest decrease from 57% to 52%, where Swadeshi Dharmam Dharma has revived
 bharat main ek arab hinduon main se anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki hindu forward jati main 26%, anya pichhadaa varg 43%, hindu anusuchit jati main 22% or hindu anusuchit janajati 9% shaamil hai
 Apart from Punjab, Kashmir, north-eastern India and parts of Lakshadweep, Hindus have an overwhelming majority in the other 24 Indian states and 6 union territories
 purvottar bharat ke 8 rajyon main se, tripura, sikkim, assam, manipur hindu bahumat hai jabaki baaki chaaron main alpsankhyak main hindu hai

 φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ , \ !}
 takneekee drushti se akshansh, ansh main ankit koniya maapan he jo bumadhya rekha par 0° se lekar dhruv par 90° ho jaataa he
 Latitude is the name of the angular distance of any place from the equator to the north or south pole
 bumadhyarekha ko 0° kii akshansh rekha mana gaya he
 All distances from the equator to the North Pole are measured at North Latitude and all distances from the South Pole to South Latitude
 dhruvon kii ore badhane par bumadhyarekha se akshansh kii duuri badhane lagati he
 In addition, all latitude lines are mutually parallel and complete circles

 At low latitudes, the sun is directly above the head at noon
 prithvi ke tal par padane vaali surya kii kirnon kii garmi vibhinn akshanshon par alag alag hoti hai

 satya ke alag-alag sandarbhon main evam alag-alag siddhanton main sarvatha bhinn-bhinn arth hai
 In justice philosophy, every decision and inference is considered
 inamen nirnay kaa sthaan kendriya he
 The literal revelation of judgment is sentence
 jab ham kisi vaakya ko sunate hai, to use sweekaar karte hai yaa asweekaar karte hai; sweekaar or asweekaar main nishchay na kar sakane kii avasthaa andeh kehalaati he
 Every decision claims to be true
 jab ham ise sweekaar karte hai to iske daawey ko satya maanate hai; asweekaar karne main use asaty kehete hai
 Faith is our ordinary mental state
 jab kisi vishwaas main truti dikhaai detii he, to ham iskaa sthaan kisi anya vishwaas tak jane kii maansik kriya hi chintan he
 Faith, be it true or untrue, is the basis of action, it makes it important in life
 nyaay kaa kaam nirnay yaa vaakya ke satyasty kii jaanch karnaa he; iske liye yah baat asangat he ki koi ise vastav main satya maanata he yaa nahin
 Two questions are worthy of consideration regarding truth - what is our intention in telling a decision or sentence as truth
 satya or asaty main bhed karne kaa maapak saadhan kya he? hamaare gyaan ke vishyon main pramukh ye hai - hamaari apni chetana avasthaaen, prakritik padaarth, tathaa chetana ke anya centre, yaa dusron ke man
 i say that i have a toothache
 iskaa arth kya he? meraa anubhav ek dhara he jisamen nirantar gati hoti rahati he
 i say that the feeling of sorrow is the main aspect in the section of the stream which is presently known
 mere liye yah spasht anubhav he or main isamen andeh kar hi nahin saktaa
 There is no other measure for me to test it, nor can it be
 spasht bodh se adhik adhikaar kisi anya anubhav kaa nahin
 We cannot have a clear understanding of other warnings
 kuch log kehete hai ki anurupata ke aadhaar par ham unke astitv main vishwaas karte hai
 But the child believes so even before he is qualified to make such an estimate
 sambhavat: vah sabhi padaarthon ko apane namoonay kaa samajhataa he or peeche kuch vastuon ko apane asmaan paakar achetan samajhane lagata he
 The question of the true untruth of decisions often arises in relation to natural facts
 main kahata hoon "mej par pustak padi he" is vaakya ke yatharth hone kaa arth kya he? i think there exists a separate, outside, table and book from me and they have a special relationship
 yadi sthiti vastav main aisi hi he to meraa vaakya satya he; aisa na hone kii haalat main asaty he
 This is the "conformity principle of truth"
 anurupata kaa siddhant vastuwaad se gathit he or sarvamaanya sa he
 In the philosophy of India, direct has been given the position of first proof
 pratyaksh "indriya or uske vishay ke samipya kaa fal he"
 This proximity can be in two ways: either the matter comes to the senses, or the mind passes through the senses and reaches the substance
 duusari ghatana ghatati he or man vishay kaa rup grahan karata he
 This is a clear support of the conformity principle
 anurupata siddhant ke anusaar ham apane vichaar or bahya sthiti main samanta dekhte hai
 We have a clear understanding of our thoughts, but how do we know the situation outside? We can say the equality of two ideas with respect to their inequality, but external matter cannot enter our consciousness
 uski tulana kisi vichaar se kaise karenge? anurupatavaad main yah maan liya jaataa he ki bahya sthiti kaa gyaan hamen pehle se hi he
 If there is such knowledge already, there is no question of the truth of the decision being untrue
 hamaari sthiti aise manushya kii sthiti he jisane tajmahal ke chitra dekhe hai, parantu tajmahal ko nahin dekha or jaananaa chahta he ki ve chitra parantu tajmahal ko nahin dekha or jaananaa chahta he ki ve chitra tajmahal ko vaastavik rup main dikhaate hai yaa nahin
 Spiritualism says that Objectivism has no means of avoiding this objection
 satya ke maapak kii khoj swayan anubhav main kerani chahie
 In experience, "internal contradiction" is the test of truth
 apane pichley drushtaant ko phir len
 "the book lies on the table", how do i know that? The eye says so
 yah ek anubhav he
 But sometimes the eye also cheats
 main haath se pustak or mej ko choota hoon
 This second experience confirms the first experience
 haath se khatkaata hoon to jo shabd sunai detaa he, vah pustak or mej se niklaa prathit hota he
 The third experience confirms both the first and the other also sees the book lying on the table
 anurupata satya kaa chihn he, parantu yah anurupata vichaar or bahya padaarth ke darmiyaan nahin, anubhav ke vividh bhaagon ke darmiyaan hoti he
 According to the attraction, each substance is attracted to other substances and also draws them
 isi tarah satya gyaan ke sabhi bhaag ek duusare par ashrith hai
 The decision that can be made with remaining experience like this is true; One who does not have this ability is untrue
 is vivaran se aisa lagata he ki satya anek satya vaakyon kaa samudaay he or is samudaay main prayek satya kii apni swatantra sthiti he
 Non-oppositionism does not accept this view
 satya samudaay nahin apitu samgr he jiskaa tatv aanshik satyon ke rup ko nishchit karata he
 In reality the truth is the same, it is inappropriate to describe the truths in the plural
 samooh main kuch ekang alag ho jaae to dusron kii sthiti main bhed nahin padataa
 If one of the bricks picks up four bricks, the rest of the bricks have no objection to it
 sharir ke ek ang par chot lage, to sara sharir dukhi hota he
 In fractional truths, every fraction represents the whole in any aspect, and in this subject the value of all the parts is not the same
 avirodhwaad ke anusaar satyon main pariman kaa bhed hota he
 The sentences we call truth are of two types - scientific rules and facts
 "do or do chaar hote hai," yadi kisi trikon ke bhuj baraabar hon, to uske kone bhi baraabar honge
 - This sentence is always true everywhere else; The distinction of country and time is inconsistent with their truth
 "bharat 1947 i
 main swadhin hua
 "this sentence could not be said before 1947, but now it is also true forever
 satya kaa teesraa siddhant "vyavahaarwad" yaa "pregmatismo" ke naam se prasiddh he
 In its modern form it is the gift of America
 vastav main vyavahaarwad koi siddhant nahin, ek manovriti he jo saamaanya se vishesh ko, sthirataa se parivartan ko, chintan se kriya ko adhik mahatv detii he
 Charles Pearce, William James and John Dewey have a special part in spreading this idea
 peers naiyamik tha, james manovaigyanik tha, diu kii abhiruchi niti or raajnneeti main thi
 Pearce used the method of behaviorism to clarify the "meaning" of suffixes, James applying it to "gentle", Dierui in judging "the nature of truth
" is tarah ve nyaay, saundaryashastra or niti ko anubhavvaad ke nikat le aae
 Pearce named the new idea "pragmatism"
 uski drudh dharna thi ki darshan ko vigyaan ke drushtikon or uski vidhi ko apnaanaa chahie
 For philosophy, true knowledge is absolute or lossless knowledge of the whole; In the view of science, such knowledge is inaccessible to human intelligence
 hame saapeksh gyaan se santusht hona chahie, yahi hamaare liye kaam kii vastu he
 The major work of philosophy has been to prove accepted beliefs, invention is the key to science
 naveen vaigyanik vidhi main aagaman or nigaman donon kaa samanvay hota he
 Some examples are pledged to the foundations, concluded as true, and finally seen to see if experience confirms them
 kisi pratigya kii aisi pushti hi uskisatyata he
 The status of each truth is the condition of the occasional vow
 prakritik niyam bhi sthaayee nahin, ve bhi vikasadhin hai
 The area of attractiveness is now more elaborate than before and in future it will be more expansive than present
 niyam bhi aadaton kii tarah pusht hote jate hai
 James made the subject of his discussion not the abstract truth, but the truth of particular beliefs
 uske vicharanusaar satya koi sthaayee vastu nahin jise dekhnaa hi hamaara kaam he, yah to kriya main banataa he
 In his book "behaviorism" he says- "vyavahaarwad, mul rup main, un darshanik vivaadon ko mitaane kaa niyam he jo iske bina antarahit hote
 Is the world one or many? Independent or subordinate? Natural or spiritual? These views are such that one or the other may be true or untrue and there is no end to disputes over such views
 vyavahaarwad kii vidhi in vishyon ke sambandh main yah he ki ham prayek pratyay kaa samaadhaan iske vyaavhaarik parinaamon ke pareekshan se karen
 If one suffix was true in place of another suffix, what practical difference would it make to a human being? If no practical distinction is seen, then in practice both sides are the same and the whole dispute is meaningless
 jab koi vivaad gambhir ho to hamen yah dikhaai ke yogya hona chahie ki donon pakshon main ek yaa duusare ke satya hone par koi vyaavhaarik bhed hota he"
 Expressing this sentiment long before James, Ramanuja had said - "behavior Ability Satyam"
 vyavahaarwad gyanamimasaa main upyogetavaad he : "jo kuch vishwaas ke sambandh main apane aapako moolyavaan siddh karata he, vah satya he
 Pragmatism assumes without hesitation that the belief that is true for one may be untrue to the other
 upar kaha gaya he ki vyavahaarwad saamaanya se vishesh ko or sthirataa se parivartan ko adhik mahatv detaa he
 We see this clearly in Dewey's education
 raajnneeti main rajtantr, shishtjanatantr or prajatantr shasno main bhed kiya jaataa he
 Even if monarchy and aristocracy are more successful, democracy is better than them, because it accepts the value of the individual
 niti main kuch niyampaalan ko or kuch shrey kii siddhi ko lakshya bataate hai
 According to Dieu, both classes are in the same confusion; They do not give due importance to special
 niti ko ek nahin anek niyamon ko, ek nahin anek saadhyon ko sweekaar karnaa chahie
 The objective is to remove the present difficulty in every situation; The action that is most helpful in this is the best in that case
 koi manushya kahin bhi sthit ho, vah acha manushya he yadi vah aage bad rahaa he, bura manushya he yadi peeche hat rahaa he
 The only goal of life is uplift or growth; Not perfection, but a constant movement towards perfection
 yah gati hi shiksha he, naitik jivan or shiksha ek hi vastu he
 According to popular thought, education is the time of preparation; It frees a person from independence and makes him independent
 yadi aisa hi he, to shikshakaal kii samaapti par shiksha kii aavashyaktaa bhi nahin rahati
 Dieu says that the effort of growth should continue till the end of life, the whole life is education
 jo kuch skulon kalejon main padhaayaa jaataa he, usamen sahitya or bhashaaon ke gyaan kii apeksha vigyaan ko adhik mahatv milanaa chahie
 In science also, the part which is obtained from books is worth more than the part that the student learns from his action
 manushya kaa dimag kaa nahin, kriya kaa astr he
 In fact conformism, antisemitism and pragmatism are not the answer to the same question
 do prashn uttar kii maang karte hai - satya se kya abhipret he? satya or asaty main bhed karne kii kasuti kya he? anurupatavaad pehle prashn kaa uttar detaa he; avirodhwaad or vyavahaarwad duusare prashn kaa uttar dete hai
 James has said that when a belief is proved to be true in terms of behavior, it is necessary for it to be equipped with the same types of truths
 yah dharna vyavhaar ko avirodhwaad ke nikat le aati he
 The three views complement each other, not against each other

 And since the Parliament is a gathering of the people's representatives, the sovereignty that the people get is against the wishes of the people Is responsible

 Proteins are an important class of organic macromolecules present in all biological components and are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur elements
 sabhi protein, amino acid ke bahulak hai
 Proteins, classified by their physical size, are nanoparticles
 Each protein polymer - also known as a polypeptide - is made up of a sequence of 20 different L-α amino acids, which are also cited as residues
 40 avasheshon ke antargat shrinkhalaa ke liye protein ke bajaay aksar peptid shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 To be able to perform their biological functions, proteins are scattered in one or more specific spatial constructs, which are driven by several non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, Van der Waals forces, and hydrodynamics Packing
 To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular level, it is often necessary to determine their three-dimensional structure
 yah sanrachanaatmak jeev-vigyaan ke vaigyanik kshetra kaa vishay he, jo protein kii sanrachana ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye eks-re crystalography, NMR spectroscopy or doharaa dhruvikaran vyatikaran-maapi jaisi takneekon ko lagu karata he
 Some specific number of residues are required to perform a particular biochemical function and about 40–50 residues appear to be the lower limit for functional domain size
 protein aakaar, is nimna seemaa se lekar bahu-kaaryaatmak yaa sanrachanaatmak protein main kai hajaar avshesh tak hote hai
 However, the current estimation of the average length of the protein is around 300 residues
 protein upikai se bahut bada samucchy gathit kiya ja saktaa he: udhaaharan ke liye, ek microphilament main ikaitha kai hajaar actin anu
 Biochemistry refers to four distinct aspects of a protein structure: sanrachana ke in staron ke alaava, ek protein apni jaivik kriyaaon ko sampadit karte hue kai samaan sanrachanaon ke bich badlaav kar saktaa he
 This process can also be reversed
 in kaaryaatmak punarvyavastha ke sandarbh main ye tritiyak yaa chaturdhatuk sanrachana ko aam taur par rasinic rachana ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he or unke bich sankraman ko rachanaatmak parivartan kaha jaataa he
 The primary structure is bound by covalent or peptide bonds, which are formed during the process of protein biosynthesis or levitation
 ye peptid bond, protein ko kathorta pradaan karte hai
 The two ends of the amino acid chain are called the C-terminal end or the carboxyl terminus and the N-terminal end or the amino terminus, depending on the nature of the free group at each end
 madhyamik sanrachana ke vibhinn prakaar, mukhya shrinkhalaa ke peptid samoohon ke bich hydrogen bond kii paddati dwaara paribhaashit hote hai
 However, these hydrogen bonds are generally not stable in themselves, as water-soluble hydrogen bonds are generally more favorable than the hydroxy-hydrogen bonds
 is prakaar, madhyamik sanrachana sirf tabhi sthir hoti he jab jal kii sthaneey sankendratha paryaapt rup se nune hoti he, jaise, pighali hui golikaa main yaa puri tarah dohari sthiti main
 Similarly, the formation and tertiary structure of the molten pellet is mainly driven by non-specific interactions on structural grounds, such as the tendency of amino acids and hydrologic interactions
 However, the tertiary structure is only fixed when portions of a protein domain are closed on a structural basis by specific interactions, such as ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and tight packing of side chains
 The tertiary structure of extracellular proteins can also be stabilized by disulfide bonds, which reduces the entropy of repetitive conditions; Disulfide bonds are extremely rare in cytosolic proteins, as the cytosol is typically a reducing environment
 bhinn amino acid kaa anukram, protein yaa peptid kii praathmik sanrachana kehalaata he
 The residue count always begins at the N-terminal end, the end where the amino group is involved in the peptide bond
 ek protein kii praathmik sanrachana, us jin se nirdhaarit hoti he jo us protein ke saath mail khaataa he
 a specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA is replicated in mrna, which is read by the ribosome in a process called conversion
 ek protein kaa anukram us protein ke liye anokhaa hota he or us protein kii sanrachana or kriya ko paribhaashit karata he
 The sequence of a protein can be determined by methods such as Edman degradation or tandem mass spectrometry
 lekin aksar, ise us jin ke anukram se sidhe padhaa jaataa he jo anuvanshik code kaa upyog karata he
 Post-conversion modifications, such as disulfide formation, phosphorylation, and glycogenylation, are also generally considered a part of the primary structure and cannot be read from genes

 Both the alpha helix and the beta sheet demonstrate a way to satiate all hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the peptide backbone
 ye madhyamik sanrachana tatv, keval polypeptid mukhya shrinkhalaa ke gunon par nirbhar karte hai, yah samajhaate hue ki kyon ve sabhi protein main maujuud hote hai
 a part of a protein that is not in a regular secondary structure is called a "non-regular structure"
 Some more representations of the same helix are shown on the right

 Secondary structures are bonded by hydrogen bonds to form supramolecular structures, such as those of Greek
 For a detailed example, see Supermodular structure
 It has also been suggested by many scientists that secondary structure is determined only by amino acid sequence
 madhyamik sanrachana ke tatwon ko aam taur par, vibhinn kismon kii ganth or modon kaa upyog karte hue ek thos aakaar main modaa jaataa he
 Formation of the tertiary structure is usually induced by burial of the hydrological residue, but other interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and disulfide bonds can also stabilize the tertiary structure
 tritiyak sanrachana main aisi sabhi gaiyr-sahasanyojak antarkriya shaamil hai jinhen madhyamik sanrachana nahin mana jaataa he or jo protein ke samgr tah ko paribhaashit karata he or aam taur par protein kii kriyaaon ke liye aprihaary he
 The quaternary structure is the interaction between several chains of peptide bonds
 vyaktigat shrinkhalaa, upikai kehalaati hai
 Individual sub-units are generally not covalently linked, but may be attached to a disulfide bond
 sabhi protein main chaturdhatuk sanrachana nahin hoti he, kyonki ve monomers kii tarah kaaryaatmak ho sakate hai
 The quaternary structure is stabilized by the interaction of the same range from which the tertiary structure is carried out
 do yaa do se adhik polypeptid ke sankul ko multimer kaha jaataa he
 In particular, if it has two subunits, it will be called a dimer, if three subunits are involved, then the trimer and four subunits are included, the tetramer
 These subunits are generally related to each other by a symmetry axis, such as a 2-fold axis in the dimer
 Multimers made from similar subunits may be referred to with a "homo-" prefix, and those made up of different subunits may be referred to with a "hetero-" prefix
 ek α-amino acid, ek aise hisse se bana hota he jo sabhi prakaar ke amino acid main maujuud hota he or ek paksh shrinkhalaa se jo avasheshon ke prayek prakaar ke liye adwitiya hota he
 Cα atoms are bound to 4 different atoms: a hydrogen atom, an amino group nitrogen, a carboxyl group carbon, and a side chain carbon specialized for this type of amino acid
 An exception to this rule is proline, where the hydrogen atom is replaced by a bond on the side chain
 kyonki carbon parmaanu chaar alag-alag samoohon ke saath bandhaa hota he jiske saath vah kiral he, lekin samavyav main se keval ek hi jaivik protein main maujuud hota he
 Glycine however, is not chiral because its side chain is a hydrogen atom
 sahi L-form ke liye ek saral smarak he "CORN": jab Cα parmaanu ko saamne h ke saath dekha jaataa he, to avshesh par dakshinavart disha main likhaa hota he "CO-R-N"
 The side chain determines the chemical properties of α-amino acids and any one of 20 different side chains: swaabhaavik rup se maujuud hone vaale 20 amino acid ko unke rasinic gunon ke aadhaar par kai samoohon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Important factors include charge, hydrophobicity / hydrophilicity, size and functional group
 The nature of the interaction of different side chains with the aquatic environment plays a major role in modulating the protein structure
 hydrophobic paksh shrinkhalaa, protein ke bich main dabi hoti he, jabaki hydrophylic paksh shrinkhalaa vilaayak ke sampark main rahati he
 Examples of hydrophobic residues are: leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and valine, and to a lesser extent tyrosine, alanine, and tryptophan
 The charge of the side chain plays an important role in protein structures, as ion bonding can stabilize protein structures and disrupt a non-coupled charge structure between proteins
 charge avshesh, bahut adhik hydrophylic hote hai or aam taur par protein ke baahar kii ore paae jate hai
 Positively charged side chains are found in lysine and arginine and in some cases in histidine
 Negative charges are found in glutamate and aspartate

 The side chains typically make an attempt to get around χ2 in the staggered structure, which is induced by the minimization of overlap between the electron orbital of the substituted atoms
 paksh-shrinkhalaa kii rachana kii vividhta aksar rotaamar librari main vyakt kii jaati he
 a rotamer library is a collection of rotamers for each type of residue in a protein with a level of side-chain independence
 rotaamar librariyon main aam taur par rachana or ek nishchit rachana kii aavriti, donon ke bare main jaankaree hoti he
 Libraries often include information about dihedral angle methods or variances about the method that can be used in samples

 Rotamer libraries are therefore usually extracted from statistical analysis of side-chain formation in known structures of proteins for which the found composition is collected or by dividing the dehedral angle space in the bin and then an average composition in each bin By determining This division typically occurs on a physical, chemical basis, such as the splitting of the rotation of the SP3 – SP3 bond into a 120 ° bin centered on each staggered structure
 rotaamar librariyaan ridh-swatantra, madhyamik-sanrachana par nirbhar, yaa ridh-nirbhar ho sakati hai
 The distinction is made on the basis of whether the dehedral angles and / or their frequencies for the rotamers depend on the local spine composition

 Many proteins are organized into multiple units
 ek sanrachanaatmak domen, protein kii samgr sanrachana kaa tatva he jo swayan-sthir he or shesh protein shrinkhalaa se aksar swatantra rup se mudata he
 Many domains are not unique to the protein products of a gene or gene family, but appear in different proteins

 kyonki ve swayan-sthir hai, domen ko anuvaanshik ejineering dwaara, kymera banane ke liye ek protein se duusare protein main "badla" ja saktaa he
 An design, in this sense, refers to a small specific combination of structural secondary elements
 These elements are often called supermodular structures

 Despite the fact that about 100,000 proteins are expressed in the eukaryotic system, there are relatively few distinct domains, structural motifs, and turns
 yah aanshik rup se vikaas kaa ek parinaam he, kyonki jin or jin ke hisse dogune kiye ja sakate hai yaa jinom ke bheetar chalaae ja sakate hai
 This means that, for example, a protein domain can be moved from one protein to another and thus assign a new function to the protein

 Note that aspects of the secondary structure overall can be determined through other biochemical techniques, such as circular dichroism or dual polarization interferometry
 Secondary structures can also be predicted with a high accuracy
 Cryo-electron microscopy has become a means of determining protein structures at high resolution in recent times and is expected to be more powerful as a tool for a higher resolution in the next decade
