 Rajni Kothari is a well-known political scientist, political theorist, educationist and author of India
 unhone 'vikasshil samaaj adhyayan peeth' kii san 1963 main sthapana kii
 It is an institute of research related to social science and humanities located in Delhi
 1980 main unhone 'lokayan' naamak santhaan kii bhi sthapana kii
 Rajni Kothari, the leading political scientist of India and founder of the Chair of Developmental Society Studies, has made an unprecedented contribution to the theorization of Indian politics in the last half century
 daleey pranali ke adhyayan main kothaari ne mukhyatah do ullekhneey sthapanaayen jodi hai
 Unlike the prevailing interpretations of bipartisan and multi-party systems, he gave a fundamental interpretation of the Indian party system as a party dominated system; And introduced the Congress as a 'system' rather than seeing Congress as a political party under prevailing definitions
 aage chal kothaari ne gaiyr-daleey raajnneeti ke siddhantikaran main bhi yogadan kiya
 Kothari's vision of interacting between caste-system and modern parliamentary politics also proved unique
 is silsile main unka pehla sutrikaran to yah he ki bharat jaise paramparabaddh samaaj ke aadhunikeekaran kaa rasta darasal saamaajik sanrachanaon ke raajnneetikaran se hokar jaataa he
 The second formulation associated with this is that the phenomenon we call casteism in politics is actually the politicization of castes, due to which the nature of caste structures is changing from within
 kothaari ek prachur rachanaakaar rahe hai
 His first book, Politics in India, was published in 1969, which offers a logical model of understanding Indian politics
 rajani kothaari kaa janm ek samrudh gujarati vyapaarik gharaane main hua tha
 His father used to trade diamonds in Burma
 unki shuruaati shiksha-diksha aayangaron dwaara chalaae jane vaale rangoon ke ek skool main hui
 Despite no tradition of intellectualism in the family, Kothari's father left no stone unturned to educate him
 unka bachapan burma ke apekshaakrit khule samaaj main beetaa
 Collective dances on the roofs of the house, mixed breathtaking forms of Mongol and Buddhist culture, the early years spent among a mixed Indian community of South Indian Chettiars, Gujarati Banis, Vohras, Khojas and Muslim traders gave them a generous psyche
 
 landan skool of iconomics se ucch shiksha praapt karne ke baad rajani kothaari ne kuch din vadodara main clasical arthshaastra padhaayaa
 During this time he was also influenced by Manvendra Nath Rai, the early lecturer of Indian Marxism and later the principal spokesman of Radical Humanism
 apane jivan ke antim daur main patni hansaa kothaari or bade bete smitu kothaari ke nidhan se aahat profesar kothaari dilli sthit awaas main apana samay guzaarte hai
 The intellectual life of Rajni Kothari can be understood by dividing it into three parts
 apane raajnneetik chintan kii shuruyaat main kothaari ne bhartiya samaaj or raajnneeti ke tathyagat vishleshan ko praathamikta di
 The special thing is that in this process he was not affected by the positivist attitude
 yah daur vah tha jab saath ke dashak main nehru yug apane patakshep kii taraf dekh rahaa tha
 It was a transitional time in which predictions of the decay and destruction of democracy were taking place
 isi maahaul main kothaari ne bhartiya loktantr ke model kii vishistataa kii shinaakht karne main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 At that time, most sociologists were trying to see the Indian experience in the light of the experience of Western democracies
 isi samay rajani kothaari samajashastri shyama charan dube ke protsaahan par rashtriya saamudayik vikaas santhaan se jud gayi
 He toured all over the country during his field work
 ve aise ilaakon main bhi gayi jahaan janaa aam taur se kaafii mushkil mana jaataa tha
 This experience made him visit India ready to change or change
 tabhi ek sukhad sanyog ke tahat unhen bhavnagar main congress ke ek adhiveshan ko dekhne kaa mauka mila
 At the same time, in the six issues of the then Economic Weekly, he had an article entitled 'the form and essence of Indian politics'
 in lekhon ne unke kadam raajnneetishastra kii duniya main jamaa diye
 These included in-depth discussions on center-state relations, panchayati raj, parliamentary form of government, bureaucracy, party system and finally the future of democracy
 is lekhamala main jis saidhantik dhaanche kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha, usee ne aage chal kar kothaari ke vishad vaanmay kii aadharshila rakhi
 The nature of these articles was controversial
 unhone ek trikonatmak kasuti pesh kii jiskaa ek kone tha loktantr ke maanya siddhanton kaa, doosraa kone tha pashchimi duniya ke loktantric anubhavon kaa or teesraa kone tha bhartiya anubhav kii vishistataa kaa
 Earlier there was only institutional and constitutional studies in political science
 raajnneeti ke vikascram ko dekhne kii yah ek anuthi nigaah thi
 These articles ranged from Laski's theories to Jaiprakash Narayan's critical thesis on decentralization
 iske baad kothaari apane saidhantik kaushal se las ho kar surveykshanon ke zariye baar-baar aam bhartiya ke paas gayi or pataa lagaaya ki hamaara loktantr zamin par kis tarah kaam kar rahaa he
 In this way the possibilities of formulation of solid foundation of study of development of Indian variety of democracy were opened
 kothaari ne siddhanton or upasiddhanton kii ek puri shrunkhlaa taiyaar kii jise kunjee kii tarah istemaal karke unhone baar-baar sabit kiya ki bharat main jis tarah ke loktantr kii rachana ho rahi he vah pashchim ke loktantron se alag kism kaa nikalegaa
 This democracy, rather than being based on a homogenizing nation-state, will make pluralism provided by Indian culture its foundation
 daleey pranali se sambandhit kothaari ke vikhyath sutrikaran isi daur kii dein hai
 He showed that the Indian party system neither fits the model of a system of political competition of two or three parties like developed capitalist countries, nor does it have the antiquity of a multi-party system
 ve pashchimi prekshkon ke is avlokan se bhi sahamat nahin the ki raajnneetik jivan par congress ke haaavee hone ke kaaran bharat ko ek daleey pranali samajha janaa chahie
 Rather, he said that there are many parties here, but one party is dominated
 or, yah varchasv ek aisi pranali ke taur par kaam karata he jisamen na keval satta paksh kii sanrachanaayen sansaadhit hoti hai, varan vipakshi sanrachanaayen bhi apni bhoomika nibhaati rahati hai
 At the same time, Kothari presented a fine outline of the transaction between caste-system and modern parliamentary democratic politics
 unka kahana tha ki raajnneeti main bhagidaari karke jati-samudaay loktantr ko pradooshit nahin karte balki apane karmkand rup kii jakad se kaafii-kuch mukt ho kar apane pehle se maujuud secular roopon ko praathamikta dene ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 Kothari's second-century compositions date back to the times when Indira Gandhi's charismatic politics was bent on changing the nature of Indian politics with its populist and autocratic trends
 shuru main kothaari ko laga ki indira gandhi ke netritv main radical parivartanon kaa aagaaz karne kii sambhaavna nihit he
 But he soon saw that the institution of the state, which has to fulfill the historical responsibility of human emancipation, is not only stealing from enriching democracy in India, but its role in the world should become a victim of politics
 Has been apatkaal main indira gandhi ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke sahyog se parhez karne ke baad unhone 1977 main congress virdohi janata party kii nitigat dhaanchaa banane main bhi yogadan kiya
 After the failure of the public experiment and Indira Gandhi's return to power, Kothari began to try to develop the idea of going beyond the state and electoral politics by outlining the North versus South ie developed vs
 undeveloped on the scale of the world
 
 isi mukaam par unhone gair-party raajnneeti ke siddhantikaran main apana yogadan kiya
 This second round of Kothari's creativity proved to be long
 unhone pashchim ke sabhyatamoolak pratimaanon ko chunauti dene vaale gandhi ke vichaaron kaa sahaara liya or ek nayaa utapia pesh karne kii koshish kii
 Rajni Kothari also took the role of a socio-political activist during this period instead of being merely an intellectual
 unhone apane sahyogi vidwaan dhirubhai sheth dwaara sthapit lokayan naamak adhyayan kaarykram main bhagidaari kii jiskaa makasad gair-party raajnneetik sanrachanaon ko samaaj-vigyaan kii duniya se jodna tha
 During these years, Kothari was also the national president of the People's Union of Civil Liberties
 apane rachanakaal ke tisare daur main kothaari ne aadhuniktaa ke vaicharik dhaanche ko kaarij kiye bina vaikalpik raajnneeti kaa sandhan karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In fact, his phase was critical as well as introspective
 unhone ateet ke apane kai prayaason ko kadi nigaah se dekha or paaya ki gair-party raajnneeti vastav main vaikalpik raajnneeti ke rup main viksit nahin ho paa rahi he
 The phenomenon of liberalism, Marxism, Gandhism and new social movements is unable to explain the changing face of Indian democracy
 is mukaam par kothaari ne apni shastreey pratibha kaa istemaal dalit- pichhadi raajnneeti ko sutarabaddh karne or antarrashtriya str par bhoomandaleekaran kii takaton ke kilaaf bauddhik nakebandi karne ke liye kiya
 He identified the distortions in the institution of the state and termed it as a state with managerial-technocratic tendencies deprived of public orientation
 unhone dikhaaya ki kis tarah yah rajya prachlit saidhantik samaj ke vipareet vividhtaon ke prati ashishnu, garibon ko haashiye par rakh kar bhul jane vaala or sampradayik raajnneeti ke saath talmail karke chalane vaala hota he

 guchi - yah janaa-mana naam italy main fishan tathaa chamade ke utpaadanon ke liye bahut prakhyat he
 It is part of the 'the House of Goochie' ie Goochie Group and is owned by pinault-printemps - a French company called Reedoot
 Gucci was founded in 1921 in Florence by Guccio Gucci

 vishwa bhar main, guchi ke kul 278 swasanchalit stores faile hue hai, saath hi yah apane utpaadanon ko adhikrut vyapaariyon tathaa ucch darje ke 'department stores' ke zariye bhi bechate hai
 In 1921 Guccio Gucci founded the 'gucci' company
 1938 main guchi kaa vistaar hua or rome main ek boutique kholaa gaya
 Guccio had a big hand in envisioning many of the company's products
 1947 main, guchi ne bans-handle vaale handbag kaa utpaadan shuru kiya jo aaj bhi company ke pramukh utpaadanon main shaamil he
 During the 1950s, Gucci developed a metal-studded 'suede moccasin' inspired by thin saddles - thin-edged weave edges and soles that became his special mark - ie 'trademark'
 guchio kii patni aida calveli ek bade parivaar se thim, par company ke kaarobaar kii bagdor keval unke beton - vasco, eldo, yugo, va rhodolpho ko hi saunpi ja sakati thi
 After Guchio's death in 1953, the company gained international prominence under Aldo's leadership and opened its first boutique in New York
 Initially Rodolfo tried to make acting his career but soon returned to take over the responsibilities of the company
 guchi ke anubhavheen varshon ke dauraan bhi, guchio kaa parivaar apane paariwarik krur kalhon ke liye kukhyat tha
 Family members would often have debates, altercations and divergences among the members regarding day-to-day matters of succession, shareholding, and operation of stores
 Gucci spread his wings abroad, but the company's future meetings often ended with high-profile debates and the throwing of purses and other items at each other
 In the late 1960s, Goochie's goal was - to expand into the Far Eastern countries and meet this goal - by opening its stores in Hong Kong and Tokyo
 At the same time, the company began to produce these products, along with its iconic logo GG - the silk scarf Flora - a favorite of Hollywood actress Grace Kelly, and Jackie Kennedy and o'bolder Bags - which made her famous in the US
 Jackie Kennedy - Wife of President John F
 Kennedy! 1970 ke lagbhag puure dashak tak, guchi kaa naam pramukh, shandaar va shahi vastuon ke utpaadan karne vaale pratishthanon main vishwa-vikhyath bana rahaa, lekin phir vyapaar se sambandhit liye gaye kuch vinaashkari nirnyon or paariwarik jhagadon ke kaaran company diwaaliyepan kii kagaar par aa khadi hui
 At that time, both the Aldo and Rodolfo brothers had equal shares in the company's shares - 50%
 lekin eldo or uske beton kii tulana main, company ke prati rhodolpho kaa yogadan kuch kam hi tha
 In 1979, Aldo founded the 'goochie Accessories Collection' or GAC, aimed at supporting the Goochie perfumes department controlled by his own sons
 The GAC consisted only of small accessories - such as: cosmetic bags, lighters, and pens - which were priced very low and represented at a much lower position than other valuables in the company's accessories catalog
 company ke sampurna sanchaalan main rhodolpho ke niyantran ko kamazor banane ke iraade se, eldo ne parfums vibhaag kaa puraa daayitv apane bete roberto ko saunp diya
 Although the Goochie Accessories Collection received considerable recognition, it proved to be the reason for the ruin of the Goochie dynasty
 kuch hi varshon main parfums vibhaag kii kamai accesris vibhaag kii kamai se kahin zyaada hone lagi
 thok-vyapaar ke is nae aayam se, kabhi khaas dukaanon main milane vaale GAC- utpaada, ab america ke ek hazaar se bhi adhik stores main uplabdh hone lage, jisase fashneble graahakon main isaki pratishtha kam hone lagi

 parantu, 1980 dashak tak pahunchate-pahunchate guchi ne apana aakarshan kho diya or hawaii-addon par milane vaala ek bhadda utpaada ban kar rah gaya
 " jald hi, guchi ke naam se nakli va saste maal bazaar main aane lage, jisase guchi kii pratishtha ko or dhakka laga
 is bich, italy main, company ke kaarobaar par paariwarik jhagadon kaa bura asar pad rahaa tha
 Rodolfo and Aldo were fighting over the perfumes department, although Rodolfo's share in it was only 20%
 isi bich, eldo ke bete paolo guchi ne 'guchi plus' ke naam se roopantarit ek saste utpaada ko prastut kiya or 1983 main vah parivaar se alag ho gaya
 It was reached that the boardroom battle took place and Paolo fell unconscious due to the injury of the telephone answering machine at the hands of one of his brothers
 In return, he wrote a tax evasion report against his own father in the US Department of Income and, on the testimony of his own son, Aldo was convicted and sentenced to prison
 or in paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaaya gapshap-patrikaon ne - unhone guchi ke bare main anaap-shanaap khabaren chhapakar aisa prachaar kiya jaise kabhi guchi ke dizins kaa hota tha
 In 1983, Rodolfo's death received another major setback for the company as he gave 50% of his shares to his son, Maurizio Goucci
 maurizio ne, board of diarectors ko apane kaabo main karne ke iraade se, eldo ke bete paolo ke saath gathbandhan kiya or apane makasad main kaamyaab hone ke liye nederlands main guchi licencing vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 After this decision, the rest of the family left the company and, over the years, it was for the first time that Gucci's entire business was in the hands of only one person
 maurizio ne, company ko tahas-nahas karne or parivaar ko khandit karne vaale jhagadon ko dafanaakar, guchi ke bhavishya ke liye, bahari pratibhaaon kaa sahaara liya
 With the changes brought in the last years of the 1980s, Gucci's name was once again counted among the most influential fashion-companies in the world, and at the same time the business proved extremely profitable
 oktober 1995 main, guchi ne aam janata ko apni company main saajhedaari ke liye aamantrit kiya or AMEX tathaa NYSE par apane pehle va aarambhik shares ko 22 dollar prati share kii dar se prastut kiya
 In November 1997, Gucci obtained a license to produce a watch called 'severin-montres', which proved to be a very successful year
 baad main company ne ghadi kaa naam badalakar 'guchi timepices' rakhaa
 The company was also awarded the title of 'european Company of the Year' by the European Business Press Federation for its economy and finance, efficient strategic vision and excellent management
 ab guchi ke karyaalay vishwa bhar main or mukhya karyaalay florence, milan, paris, landan, hong kong, japan or new york main faile hue hai

 1989 main, maurizio ne don melo ko - jinhone 1970 main, new york ke 'bergedorf gudman' company kaa punarutthan kiya or khudara-vyapaar ke kshetra main prasiddhi paayi - apane nav-gathit guchi samooh ke 'igjecutive vaais president' tathaa 'creative diarector worldwide' ke pad-bhaar ko sanbhaalane ke liye raji kiya
 At that time, 'goochie America' was in the hands of Domnico de Sol - who had previously advocated - and who, in 1987 and 1989, helped Maurizio in the enactment of ten companies
 company kii creative team - jisame jeffri been or calvin cline ke diziners pehle se hi shaamil the - ke aakhri sadsy the, yuva diziner - tom ford
 Raised in Texas and New Mexico, Tom Ford was interested in fashion designing since his teens, but in 1986, he decided to pursue fashion design as a career after leaving an architecture course from 'parsons School of Design'
 don melo ne, 1990 main, apane saathi, lekhak or sampadak richard bakale ke aagrah par ford ko company main niyukt kiya
 The period Guchi went through in the early 1990s is considered to be the worst period in the company's history

 Compensation When someone is harmed by the behavior of another person, then a natural reaction is to know what will be the treatment
 This inherent duty of law is to compensate for losses
 is purti kii kai reetiyaan hai
 One is to compensate the loser by giving them some currencies
 at: kshatiputi vah vastu he jisase prativaadee ke kartavyolalanghan se hui haani kii purti uske hi dwaara vaadi ko di jaanvaali ek nishchit dhanrashi se kii ja sake
 There are two problems with this compensation
 pehali yah ki vaadi kii ukt kshati kii paridhi kitni he jiske liye prativaadee ko uttaradaayi tehraaya gaya
 The second is how to lose its value in rupees even after the extent of irreparable damage is fixed
 donon hi baaten ek suvyavasthit vichaar kii apeksha rakhti hai
 There are some basic rules related to these problems: pehla yah ki ‘maanviya dushkrity apane honevaale prabhaavon tak hi nahin simit rahete
 Often there is a series of workings that go far into the remote directions of its ill effects'
 ‘ek jahaaj yadi kisi duusare jahaaj se takaraa jaae to jahaaj kaa swami diwalia ho hi jayega, baad ko uskaa parivaar bhi shiksha evam avasaron ke abhaav se peedit ho saktaa he’
 From the point of view of moral morality and naturalism, the guilty should be held responsible for all the deprivations arising out of the said loss of the plaintiff
 ham prativaadee dwaara kiye gaye aparaadh ke parinaamon ko kisi nishchit ansh tak nahin pahunch sakate
 There is no end to the results, but there is an end to the expected duties
 vidhi isi apekshit kartavya kii vyavhaarya evam susangat seemayen tay karnaa aavashyak samajhati he
 The rules of 'hadley v Baxendall' suit apply
 inke anusaar keval unhi kshatiyon kii purti honi chahie jo yaa to swabhavat: utpann hai yaa jinke vishay main tarksangat upayon se aisa samaj liya gaya ki ubhay paksh ne samjhauta karte samay hi uske ulanghan se utpann, in parinaamon kii kalpana kar lee thi
 In the case of 'green Land v
 Chaplin' in the law of harm, it is stated that the defendant can only be expected to compensate for what a generally intelligent person might presume
 kintu bhavishyadarshita kii is kasuti ko ‘smith banaam landan and south western railway kan
’ vaale maamle ke niptaare main nahin apanaaya gaya tha
 It was decided that the culprit is liable for all kinds of consequences in the event of negligence; Whether he has already thought them or not
 asaavadhaanee siddh ho jane ke baad is aapatti kii gunjaaish nahin rah jaati kii kshatipurti kii maang aashaa se adhik he
 This rule is called 'in Re Polemis Furnace Vidi & Co
' Stabilized in the case of prativaadee ke naukar jahaaj se maal utaar rahe the
 One stole a wooden frame and went down to the petrol-vapor rubbing of the ship
 is kriya se usamen aag lag gai or yah aag kuch der main puure jahaaj main fail gai
 The ship's owner claimed compensation for the entire ship
 bachaav main prativaadee kaa kahana tha ki use itane bade dushprinaam kii kalpana na thi kintu yah yukti sweekaar nahin ki gai
 After proving negligence in any action, the counter-notification will be responsible for all the consequences which can be directly related to the said work
 duusari samasya he kshatipurti ke swaroop evam seemaa kaa nirdhaarit kar dene ke baad uskaa mulya rupayon main kutane kii
 Compensation is assessed by written rules: pehla yah ki shariabandh samjhaute kii vidhi main kshatipurti kaa aadharbhoot uddeshy hota he-haani sahanevaale paksh ko upyukt dhanrashi dilaakar usee sthiti par le aana jis par vah samjhauta bhang hone ke badale uski purti ho janevaali dasha main pahunch paata
 Thus, the compensation is only to compensate the loss suffered by the plaintiff and not to punish the violator
 hanivishyak vidhi main bhi niyam to isi aapurti kaa hi he, kintu isamen kshati kiye jane ke thug par kshatipurti kaa parinaam badhaayaa ghataya ja saktaa he
 Where the damage is done intentionally or in disguise, the court can supply the plaintiff's damages by giving more than reasonable money
 is prakaar kii kshatipurtiyan adarsh athwa dandatmak samajhi jaati he
 The purpose of the punitive damages is to punish the defendant on the one hand, and on the other hand also to motivate the absentee plaintiff
 jahaan kshati agyaanavash pahunchaai gai he athwa vaadi vaise bhogadand ke upyukt he, use bahut choti rakam se kshatipurti karne ko kaha jaataa he
 These deferential damages have been considered
 ye vaadi ke kaary ke viruddh nyaayalay kii berukhi prakat karti hai
 Secondly, since the underlying motive in both the affirmative agreement and the defamation case is that of lack of compensation, a rule today dictates that if the plaintiff has not incurred the loss, he is not even a claimant of any compensation
 kintu vaadi ke vaid adhikaron ke atikaraman kii avasthaa main nyaayalay ek choti rakam kii kshatipurti use dilaa saktaa he
 These namnas are reparations which in reality are worth going for somewhere, but they have no special existence in terms of quantity
 ‘ashbi banaam hwite’ kaa maamla iskaa udhaaharan he
 The plaintiff was a voter in the parliamentary elections
 chunaav-adhikari se use apana mat dene se roka
 The plaintiff claimed infringement of his legitimate rights over it
 prativaadee ne bachaav main yah tark upasthit kiya ki vaadi ko usase koi vittiya kshati nahin hui
 But the court said that every loss takes its compensation, even if not a single loss of that party is lost
 kshatipurti keval dandatmak hi nahin hoti
 The loss also compensates in the event that there is an obstruction in any jurisdiction
 jaise, galat prachaar main kahe gaye shabdon dwaara kisi ko bhi, kam se kam, maatr kahe janevaale shabdon se koi aarthik haani nahin hoti lekin usapar karrwai kii ja sakati he
 If a person punches one of the other's ears, it does not cost the victim, but it can be acted upon
 kisi duusare kii bhoomi par sawari le janaa haani na hote hue bhi uski sampatti par akraman mana ja saktaa he
 Third is that in both the agreement and the defaults, the duty of the plaintiff is to take necessary steps to mitigate the damage
 udaahranarth, prativaadee ne samjhauta bhang karte hue yadi vaadi ke maal kaa apane jahaaj par ladane se inkaar kar diya to yah vaadi kaa karttavya he ki, uplabdh ho sake to, vah kisi duusare jahaaj par saamaan ladava de
 The defendant was not liable for the loss if he showed negligence and accidentally destroyed the goods lying in the dockyard
 isi prakaar kisi ek dal dwaara saamagreevahi jahaaj die jane se inkaar kiye jane par kshati ke shaman ke liye jahaaj ke maalik kaa karttavya he ki vah vaise anya kisi bhi sulabh jahaaj kaa upyog kare
 Analysis of this theory Jamal v
 Mullah, Dawood ad Co
 In the case of ek samjhaute ke anusaar 23,500 sheyaron ke bechney or 30 disambar 1911 tak use bheje jane tathaa bhugtan hone kii baat tay hui
 Shares were invited but the defendant withdrew from taking their delivery or paying the money
 ab aise maamalon main samjhautevaale tathaa bazaar ke mulyon ke bich antar hi isaki purti kaa aadhaar hoga
 1,09,218 from the agreed price on the shares on the day of breach of agreement
 Should have got less
 lekin 28 farvari 1912 tak koi bikri nahin hui
 At this time the market rate was increasing, so on the shares, only 79,862 rupees from the agreed price
 Get less prativaadee kaa aagrah tha ki hamen keval 79,862 ru
 kaa hi uttaradaayi tehraaya jaae
 But it must be ensured that there should be an inherent difference between the measure of such damages, the market rate on the day of settlement and the rate of settlement
 yahan bechnewala apni kshatipurti ke liye uskaa bharpoor mulya le saktaa he
 If the seller keeps those shares even after the breach of agreement, then he will be entitled to get any additional compensation from the buyer, in case the market rate falls and neither the amount of compensation will be reduced in case the market rate goes up
 Will be able to prativaadee dwaara dey kshatipurti kaa moolyankan mukhyat: nyaayalay hi karata he
 Action taken at the stage of the evaluation court being considered is called for 'undue damages'
 kintu kabhi kabhi ye samjhautevaale paksh kshatipurti kii rakam kii maang samjhauta bhang karanevaale vyaktiyon se karte he
 If the amount of that fixed estimate is exactly equal to the expected loss, it will be considered as compensation paid and the entire amount will have to be paid to the guilty party
 kintu yadi vah sambhavit haani ke baraabar nahin samajha gaya varan yah mana gaya ki samjhauta bhanjak ko dand dene athwa is prakaar kii galati kaa atyadhik bhugtan ke liye nishchit kii gai he to ise jurmaane ke baraabar samajha jaayga
 The court disagrees with this and allows only those damages that compensate the plaintiff's actual loss

 acharya bharat ne naatyashaastra ke pratham adhyay main natya ko teenon lokon ke vishaal bhaavon kaa anukirthan kaha he tathaa ise sarvavarnik pancham veda batalaaya he
 According to Bharata, there is no knowledge, craft, education, yoga and karma that do not appear in the drama - sanskrit natya sahitya kaa vikaas kramshah vedikakaal se hi prarambh ho gaya tha
 In this context, Prof
 The statement of Indrapal Singh "indra" is noteworthy - such signs are definitely found in the Vedas that prove the position of the Natakas in the Vedic period
 rugveda ke sookhton main somavikray ke samay hone vaale abhinay kaa pataa chalata he
 On the occasion of the Mahavrata source, the Kumarias orbited the fire with the dance anthem
 shukla yajurveda kii vaajasaney samhita ke tisven adhyay kii chhathi condika main ‘‘shailush’’ shabd aayaa he, jiskaa arth he- abhinayta
 It is said that a yarn should be appointed for dance and rock for singing
 samaveda ke strot ragabaddh hai hi jisase gyaat hota he ki vaidic yug main sangeet purna vikasavastha main tha
 Apart from music, signs of dance and instrument are also found
 isse yah siddh hota he ki vaidic yug main ve sabhi upadan prachur maatra main paye jate the jo naatak ke vikaas ke liye apekshit hai
 Signs of drama are also found in the Ramayana and Mahabharata after the Vedas
 mahabharat main ‘‘ramayana naatak’’ tathaa ‘‘cober rangabhisar’’ naamak naatakon ke naam aaye hai
 In the Virat festival of Mahabharata, there is a use of theater and nuts
 ramayana main bhi ‘‘nat’’, ‘‘naatak’’, ‘‘rang’’ tathaa nartak kaa anek sthanon par ullekh praapt hota he
 Panini has also given the impression of the earlier composition of plays by Parasarya Shilalibhya Bhiksunatasutryo in 'ashtadhyayi'
 chaturth shatee i
purv ke kautil ‘‘arthshaastra’’ ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki nat, nartak, gayak, vadak, plavak, kushilav, saumitr tathaa chaaran aadi naatakadi karke apana jeevakoparjan karte the
 There is a legend in the "chullavagga" of "vinayapitaka" in the Buddhist texts that after seeing Ashwajit and Punavasu acting with the dancer, they were immediately expelled from the Vihara by Mahasthavir
 atev is samay main bhi natyakala bharatvyaapee ho gai thi
 Patanjali has named two plays "kansavadh" and "balivadh" in "mahabhashya"
 mahabhashya main ‘‘rasiko natah’’ pad siddh karata he ki patanjali ke samay ras siddhanth kaa purna gyaan tha
 From the above description it is proved that the plays originated in India and developed from the Vedic period to its advanced form
 vartmaan main uplabdh jo roopak hai, unamem naatakkaar bhasavirachit roopak sabase pracheen he - aisi adhikansh vidwaanon kii manyata he
 In other words, we can say that Bhasa is the protagonist of Sanskrit drama literature
 sanskrit sahitya ke pramukh naatakon kaa adhyayan karne par unki nimnlikhit pramukh visheshtaayen drushtigat hoti hai - 1
 In Sanskrit plays, the object, the leader and the Rasa these elements have been given a prominent place
 inhen tatwon ke aadhaar par rupakon kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya he - ‘‘vastu netaa rasasteshaan bhedak‘
 There are ten distinctions of the metaphor in which drama is the first distinction
 2
 jahaan tak kathavstu kaa sambandh he, adhikansh naatakon kii kathavstu aitihaasik evam puranic he
 Most of the plays have been written on the basis of the story of Ramayana and Mahabharata
 3
 jahaan tak netaa athwa paatro kaa sambandh he, kathavstu ke anuroop hi paatro ko rakhaa gaya he
 There are also some dramas in which all sections of society are represented, such as the "mruthaktik" of Shudraka
 4
 ukt teenon tatwon main bhi ras ko sarvaadhik pradhanta di gai he
 Sanskrit playwrights have not paid as much attention to the accuracy of the narrative as to communicating any particular thing in the hearts of observers or readers
 kavi kii safalataa kaa mandand rasabhivyakti kaa mana gaya he
 Rasa was considered to be the primary goal of drama
 shringaar athwa vir ras main se kisi ek ko pradhan ras in naatakon main mana gaya he, shesh sahaayak rason ke rup main prayukt huye hai
 5
 Nandi recitation of most Sanskrit plays has been started from the preamble etc
 and ended with "bharatavakya" as per theatrical rules
 6
 5 se lekar 7 ankon tak kii sankhya in pramukh sanskrit naatakon kii he
 Most plays are of 6 and 7 digits
 7
 sanskrit naatakon main patranusaar bhashaa kaa prayog hua he
 The best class characters use Sanskrit and the other characters use Prakrit language
 8
 sanskrit naatakon kaa pradhan gun abhinayyata he
 His dialogue plan is very attractive
 parantu arestu dwaara nirdisht samay evam sthaan kii anviti kaa praayah in naatakon main abhaav he, kyonki anek sanskrit naatakon main kavyatv paksh balvan ho gaya he
 9
 Most Sanskrit dramas are written Sukhant
 parantu yah kathan yuktisangat nahin ki sanskrit main duhkhant naatakon kaa nitant abhaav he
 If grief drama is meant to depict the grief, defeat and death of the protagonist, then "karnabhar", "urubhang", Vennabhaka and Chandkaushik should be considered as grief dramas
 10
 nayak evam nayika ke atirikt vidooshak kii bhi sanskrit naatakon main mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 11
 Sanskrit plays have a close association with nature
 antah prakruti evam bahya prakruti kaa in naatakon main sundar samanvay kiya gaya he
 The external nature acts as a canvas to depict subtle and delicate feelings of the inner nature
 prakruti kaa maanvikaran bhi sanskrit rupakon kii apni visheshta rahi he
 In these, human's close relationship with nature is visible
 kalidas ke ‘‘abhigyaan shaakuntalam’’ main shakuntala kii vidaai k samay prakritik upaadaanon kii sthiti kaa sajiv kaarunik varnan hriday ko sahaj bhavabhibhoot karne vaala he - Similarly, a delightful description of the Bhavabhuti-designed "uttararamcharit" drama is visual - is prakaar ke varnan vastutah sanskrit natya sahitya main prakruti ke maanvikaran ke adwitiya udhaaharan hai
 12
 Sanskrit plays have a predominance of sentiment
 bhaavon kaa sookshm ankan tathaa unamem kavyochit soundarya ko samahit karne main hi sanskrit naatakkaar kaa sarvaadhik praytn dekha jaataa he
 This is the reason why Sanskrit plays do not have as much simplicity in their acting as is possible in Western plays
 sanskrit kaa naatakkaar kavi hriday hone ke naate bhaavon ko hi ganbhiry kaa janak samajhataa he, vah kori kalaatmakataa ko mahatv nahin detaa
 13
 In Sanskrit metaphors, the plot also follows the poetic form
 kathanaky pravaahikta ke aadyant nirvaah main paanch arthprakrutiyon, karyavasthaon evam sandhiyon kii yojana hoti he
 Acting status as a special one of Bharti, Satvati Kashiki and Arbhati are adopted
 14
 prabhavotpaadakta sanskrit naatakon kii pramukh visheshta he
 The root cause of the efficacy is that in Sanskrit plays, the playwright presents the performance of a past event in such a way as to give a direct impression to the readers or projectors
 is prastuti dwaara pathakon se ghatana ke saakshaat sampark kii anubhuti hi naatak ko mahakavy athwa upanyaas kii apeksha adhik prabhavotpadak bana detii he
 15
 At the core of the creation of Sanskrit plays, the main objective has been to entertain the grieving, tired and mourned people, as Bharathamuni wrote in the first chapter of Natyashastra: - sanskrit ke mahaan naatakkaar kalidas ne apane naatak ‘malvicagnimitra’ main atyant manohar nrity-abhinay kaa ullekh kiya he
 That picture is so impressive, delightful and succulent in itself that it is considered unequaled in the entire ancient literature
 ‘malvicagnimitra’ naatak main do nrityaachaaryon main apni kala nipunata ke sambandh main jhagada hota he or yah nishchit hota he ki donon apni-apni shishyaaon kaa nrity-abhinay dikhaaen or apakshpatini bhagwati kushiki nirnay karengi ki donon main koun ksheshth he? donon acharya taiyaar hue
 Mridang rang
 prekshagrih main darshakagan yathasthaan baith gayi
 With the permission of the niece, Acharya Ganadas, the teacher of the queen's hostess Malavika, brought Sujitha Shishya to Rangbhumi from the interval of Yavanika
 yah pehle hi sthir ho gaya tha ki chhalik nrity-jisamen abhinayta duusare kii bhoomika main utarkar apane hi manobhaav vyakt karata he-ke saath hone vaale abhinay ko dikhaaya jayega
 Malavika begins the anthem
 marm yah tha ki durlabh jan ke prati premaparavasha premika kaa chitt ek baar pidaa se bhar uthta he or phir aashaa se ullasit ho uthta he, bahut dinon ke baad phir usee priyatam ko dekhakar usee kii ore vah ankhen bichaaye he
 The sentiment came out of Malavika's heart directly, the gorge was her compassion
 uske athulaneey soundarya, abhinayavyanjit ang-saushthav, nrity kii abhiram bhangima or kanth ke madhur sangeet se raja or prekshakagan mantra-mugdh se ho rahe
 It was only after acting that when Malvika started going towards the screen, the clown stopped her on some pretext
 vah thithakkar khadi ho gayi uskaa bayen haath katidesh par vinyast tha, uskaa kankan kalai par sarak aayaa tha, dahinaa haath shithil shyamlata ke samaan sidhaa jhul padaa tha, jhuki hui drushti pairon par adi hui thi, jahaan pair ke anguthe farsh par bichhe hue pushpon ko dhire-dhire sarka rahe the or kamaneey dehalata nritybhangi se ishadunnit thi
 Malvika stood in the same way, with the grace with which she was right to stand in the background
 parivrajika kushiki ne daad di-abhinay bilkul nirdosh he
 The expression of acting is clearly published without speaking, the speech has become very beautiful and chaturistic
 jis-jis ras kaa abhinay hua he, us-us ras main tanmayata spasht lakshith hui he
 The sentiment has come to life and is clear, Malavika has forcefully pulled our mind towards acting from other subjects
 kalidas ne is shloke main bhartiya samskruti, kala, soundarya or abhinay kaa sajiv adarsh prastut kar diya he
 Anyway, Kalidas theater is called 'chakshush Yagya'
 unka yah shloke iskaa udhaaharan he ki sanskrit naatak kaa soundaryashastra bhartiya samskruti or paramparaon se niklaa hua he or chintan, anand, soundarya bodh se judaa he
 Sanskrit has always emphasized good drama
 achche natyaprayog main jitna ‘krida tatva’ jaruri mana gaya, utana hi uskaa parishkarkarta or shubh, mangalik rup bhi
 But nowhere is it different from the world, there is a sense of the world, drama with different expressions of life, action and trade leads us to harmony, that's why our Sanskrit drama is a symbol of joy, joy, like the West
 Not of simulation and tragedy
 sanskrit naatak or rangamanch isiilie lokdharmee or natyadharmee donon paramparaon se viksit hua he
 The Sanskrit drama uses sophisticated intelligence, rich imagination and artistry, believing folk behavior and human nature as the only evidence
 vah ek nishchit darshan or samskruti kaa parichaayak he
 Nataraja Shiva, the god of Indian drama and theater, is a symbol of well-being, of harmony and mangalaya
 hamaare yahan naatak or rangamanch kaa udai hi dharmik krity, dharmik anushthan ke rup main hua tha
 Therefore its form is ritualistic
 purvarang kii sari prakriya main ek sampoorn vidhaan he-pratyaahar se se lekar prarochana aadi tak indradhvaj aadi sara vidhaan dharmik or anusthanparak he is anushthanik vaataavaran kii sristi kai natyarudhiyon or dharmitaaon ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 In Natyasastra, Bharatmuni has said that this play is 'panchamveda' in which there is religion, somewhere it is a play, some meaning, some peace 


 This is the preaching of everyone in the world through the act of drama, emotion, action and actions
 is
 


vastutah yah sanskrit naatak kaa saamaajik paksh bhi vyakt karata he
 Our basic voice is not of struggle but of fruit, of joy
 naatak ke kathanak, kathavidhan, karyavyavasthaayen armbh or praytn se shuru hokar praptyasha niyatapti se hote hue falaagam kii ore agrasar hoti he
 That is why karma has importance in Sanskrit drama, not luck, and the hero performing the deed is Dhirodatta the hero who has all the Indian qualities of goal-achievement
 ras aadhaar he puure naatak or rangamanch kaa
 'ten Rasa and Natyam Rasanubhuti is the play of drama, that's why we have plans for many virtuous sentiments, permanent expressions and importance has been given to' Rasnipatti 'and generalization
 ‘asur paraajay’, ‘amrit manthan’ ‘tripurdaah’ naatakon ke prasang bhi yah dikhaate hai ki naatak jivan se judaa hua tha
 And during Bharat Muni's time itself, the various elements of the play were decided - nut, dance, dance, musical dialogue, Kathavastu Theater
 ‘malvicagnimitra’ main kalidas ne bhi natyacharya gandaas ke mukh se spasht kahalaaya he
 Natya Variyaruparjanasya Bahudhyatyankam Samaradhanam '
 manushyon kii ruchi bhinnata ke aadhaar par hi naatak-rachana hoti he naatak ko ek aisi kala mana gaya he jise har shrenee kaa vyakti bhed-bhav rahit ho kar dekh sake
 Devadatta Shastri has also said that 'probably the first attempt to eradicate class struggle was done through drama
 ’ Music plays a big role in the variety, joy and sophistication that Sanskrit drama leads to
 utsavdharmita, vibhinn raagon kaa rituon, utsavon, samay or bhaavon se, rason se sambandh naatakkaar maanakar chalate-hai taal, lay, nrity, vaadya-vaadan, geet kaa shastreey vidhaan ek sampoorn soundaryashastra rachataa he jo bahut samrudh or gambheer, sarthak, sarjanaatmak he
 Udyan of 'swapnavasavadatta' and 'mrutchkatikam' Charudatta are themselves musicians
 sutaradhar, nat-nati aadi dwaara mangalacharan, gayan, nandipath ek aisi soundarya-sristi karata he or usase purv purvarang vidhaan rangashaala main aise vaataavaran kii rachana karata he, prekshak kii manobhumi taiyaar karata he ki ham ek bhinn lok main hi pahunch jate hai
 This not only attracts the music and the observer, but also leads to the atmosphere related to the subject of the play
 tanmayata, talleenta puraa manovigyaan hi badal detii he
 When the narrator is asked to start the music in the drama 'vennichabha', the matriarchal asks - 'kaatam samayamayyavita gayatam' means to be sung on the basis of a season? All these experiments also express the internal relationship of season, time, music and also give freedom in 'natyaprayoga' so that the narrator can also change it as needed
 yah bhi vishesh baat he ki sanskrit naatak main nrity or vaadan kaa prayog adhik he, geeton kaa kam
 Sometimes, the composer also gives an indication of the important musical aspect of that period, such as 'gandharva Shrotum Gatasya' is used by Shudraka for the hero Charudatta in 'mrutchkatikam', which suggests the prevalence of Gandharva music
 lokranjan, kavyanand atmanand sanskrit naatak kaa abhinn ang rahe hai
 Obviously, to reach this joy, the observer was also expected to have a special interest in him
 kith kaa to kahana he ki ‘asabhy, murkh, naastik or nimnavargeey prekshakashaalaon main pravesh nahin kar sakate the
 'those audiences were familiar with the rules of ras-shastra, dance and music acting
 naatyashaastra main spasht kaha he ki prekshak kii sabhi indriya durast hone chahie, uhapoh main use patu hona chahie- dosha kaa jaanakar or raagi hona chahie
 He should be sensitive, gentle
 vah sadgunshil ho, kala, shilp kaa marmajna ho, taaki naatak jaisi jatil, sanshlisht kala kaa purna anandanubhav vah kar sake
 The observer is directly related to the actor
 hamaari bhartiya natyaparampara main nirdeshak kaa nahin, abhinayta kaa mahatva he-samast abhivyakt kaa vahi aadhaar he, mukhya madhyam he isiilie hamaare naatyashaastra main abhinayta kaa, uske vyaktitv, gunon, kriyaaon kaa itnaa vishad or gambheer varnan he
 The actor's body gives new meaning to his voice, speed, gesture, action, business, that's why so many postures of the eye, head, hands, feet, etc
 are mentioned with various types of acoustic, speech, diet, satvic types - different Anga-apangas, postures, ejaculations, karanas, chari etc
 have been detailed in that their actual training 'creates' the actor in the right values and realizes fantasies of creation without external devices
 abhinay kaa vah adbhud bhandar he jiskaa prayog bharatnatyam nrity main to ho rahaa he lekin rangamanch main utana nahin
 The entire scripture of acting is the basis of Sanskrit plays
 vah ek suvyavasthit kaary-pranali, sadhana, aasthaa or visheshgyata maangata he jaisi ki sangeet ke gharaanon main, shastreey kala main apekshit hoti he
 Although Sanskrit dramas used to be in the Rajprasadas and temples, there is also a mention of the architectural scriptures and theatrical pavilions of that time
 bade-bade mandiron main yaa anya sthanon par mandap khadey kar diye jate the
 The stylus is mentioned in the Natyasastra
 bharat ne teen prakaar ke natya mandap bataaye hai-vikrusht chaturasr, traysr
 Their differences have also been told
 manch par rangapith, rangashirsh, nepathy, mattavaarini, yavanika tiraskarani aadi kii vyavastha ek puri prastuti pariklpana ko, soundarya bodh ko vyanjit karti he
 In fact, the Sanskrit stage was speculative, anti-satyabhas
 drishividhan ho athwa koi drishyaatmak kaary ho, drishy ho-upavan, phool lataaon, sagar, pani, aandhi, tufaan aadi ke, yaa rath ke, pakshi ke to uski kalpana kar lee jaati he
 In 'abhigyanasakuntalam', only the visual actors of the speed of the chariot, the running of the antelope, the transcendence of Dushyant, etc
, are estimated by their postures and movements
 yahi natyadharmee vidhion kaa sankettmak vidhaan he jo maanviya he yantrik or chamatkaari nahin he
 Often in Sanskrit plays, scenes of mountains, planes, darkness, sunrise, hunting etc
 are done by Chitrabhinay
 kalidas, bhawabhooti shudrak ke naatakon main varsha, kaa megh-garjan, chandroday mrug shaavak, vanar, greeshm or sharad ritu singh sarp aadi ke drishyon ko abhinay hi pratyaksh karata he
 Akashbhita Jantik, abused theatricals also show acting skills and Sanskrit drama theater as nature
 sanskrit rangamanch multah kaavyatmak rangamanch he isliye usamen bhavanukirthan, bhavadharmita kaa vaishishty he
 This poetry is created from the overall composition, from acting to music, from language
 naatak prekshak ke bhaavon ko udbuddha karata hua unhen rasaswadan karaata he
 All the vision related to rasa nishta is based on theatrical
 prekshak ko sanskrit manch ne kabhi nahin bhulaayaa
 It was considered a dramatic accomplishment to satisfy him
 ‘abhigyanshakuntalam, ‘malvicagnimitra’ or ‘maltimadhav’ kii prastavana main spasht kaha gaya he ki unki vidvit parishad ke saamne prastut kiya gaya
 This shows the importance of Natyaprayoga in Sanskrit and the connection between the Natyaprayoga and the deepening of the observer
 hindi main is prakaar kaa koi nijee soundaryashastra nahin ban paaya
 a creative effort was made by Bharatendu and Prasad, but he remained limited to them
 donon naatakkaar apni lokdharmee or natyadharmee paramparaon ke aadhaar par bhartiya naatak or paashchaatya naatak ke aadhaar par hi hindi naatak or rangamanch kii prakruti kaa, shaastra kaa anveshan kar rahe the jo unheen tak simit hokar rah gaya
