 utak vigyaan yaa ootiki kii paribhaasha dete hue storer ne likhaa he : utak vigyaan yaa sookshm sharir angon ke bheetar utakon kii sanrachana tathaa unke vinyas ke adhyayan ko kehete hai
 The term histology of English is formed from the Greek words histos and logia, which means the study of tissues
 at: utak vigyaan vah vigyaan he, jiske antargat utakon kii sookshm sanrachana tathaa unki vyavastha athwa vinyas kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The word 'tissue' derives from the French word tissue, meaning structure or texture
 is shabd kaa prayog sarvapratham francisi sharir vaigyanik billit ne 18veen shatabdi ke ant main sharir yaa sharir-rachana vigyaan ke prasang main kiya tha
 He mentions about b type of tissues in his book
 kintu, aajkal keval chaar prakaar ke mukhya utakon ko manyata praapt he, jinke naam hai : ipithiliyami, sanyojak, peshiy or tantrikeey utak 
 Since time immemorial, humans have been identifying animals, birds and plants by their shape and size
 vigyaan ke vikaas ke saath vanaspatiyon tathaa jantuon ke sharir ke bheetar kii sanrachana jaanane kii bhi jigyaasa utpann hoti gai
 This curiosity led to the development of surgery
 chikitsa tathaa jeevvaigyanikon ne pashu or vanaspatiyon kii cheerfaad karke unke ang kii sanrachanaon-ang prataangon-kaa adhyayan aarambh kiya
 This study resulted in the creation of the entire body
 isi ke saath jab sookshmdarshi yantron kaa vikaas hua to jatil aantarik sanrachanaayen bhi spasht hoti gai
 This microscopic mechanical study has been termed as Physics
 at: bloom tathaa foset ke shabdon main 'ootiki yaa sookshmdarshi sharir ke antargat sharir kii vah aantarik sanrachana aati he jo nangi aankhon se nahin dikhalaai detii
 The structural and functional unit of all living beings is cells
 isi koshika ke adhyayan ko koshika vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 The mass of cells consists of tissues and the formation of organs from tissues
 utakon kii sanrachana kaa adhyayan karanevaale vigyaan ko autikee tathaa angon kii sanrachana kaa adhyayan karanevaale vigyaan ko sharir kehete hai
 Due to the study of optics and cytology, the intractable mysteries of the body got penetrated
 in donon ke sanmilit adhyayan se ootiki-rog-vigyaan kaa vikaas hua
 In 1932, Knoll and Ruska invented the electron microscope, which explained the complex structures of cells and tissues
 isi ke saath saath sharirkriyavigyaan kaa bhi vikaas hota gaya or nae nae rahasyon kaa niraavaran sambhav hua
 Thus, the combined effort of these three sciences has brought unprecedented revolution in the field of biology
 ootiki or koshikavigyaan mukhya rup se sookshm sanrachanaon ke aakaarkiya swaroop ko spasht karte hai
 But since the discovery of aniline pigments, the complex structures of cells have also started to be gained
 aaj sainkadon prakaar ke ranjakon kaa prayog karke sookshm se sookshm sanrachanaon par prakaash daalaa ja rahaa he
 Thus, chemistry has now entered the field of energy
 bhanti bhanti ke sthayikaron ke prayog se ranjakon kii rasinic pratikriyaaon kaa samuchit gyaan praapt ho rahaa he
 Knowledge of organisms, cytoplasm and the chemical structures of many organelles in them and cells is now accessible to the general public
 ye angak kis prakaar visheshikrut kaary sampadit karte hai, yah ab agyaat nahin rah gaya
 The study of the chemical nature of microstructures is called ocytochemistry or cytochemistry, and now optics and oxytochemicals are studied together
 hellen dean ke matanusaar is prakaar kii adhyayanvidhiyon kii teen pramukh kotiyaan hai: Bailey's book on the subject of optics emphasizes on histology as well as cell scientific studies
 beli ke matanusaar, chunki utak-vigyaan sanrachana sambandhi adhyayan he or vichchhedan dwaara praapt sharirarachana sambandhi gyaan kii purti karata he, at: iske sharir-kriya-vigyaan tathaa rogavigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh par bhi bal dena aavashyak he
 
 inke matanusaar bhi utak vigyaan kaa aadhaar koshikashareer athwa koshikavigyaan hi he
 From the above description it appears that cytology and histology should be studied together
 chunki koshikaaye atisookshm sanrachanaayen hoti hai, at: ham utak vigyaan ko sookshmsharir kaa hi paryaay maanakar ootiki kaa adhyayan karenge
 Since tissues are made by cells, we will study the energy through cells
 utakon ke samyak adhyayan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki sookshmdarshak yantra tak unhen laane ke purv unako vishesh paddatiyon dwaara upachaar kiya jaae
 To make a microscopic study of the tissue, it is mandatory that it be ultra-thin
 jivit utak ke vibhinn bhaagon main bahut samantaayein pai jaati hai
 Therefore, it is not possible to study it properly
 in kathinaaiyon ko dur karne ke liye sarvapratham utak ko 4 se 8 micron tak vichchhedit kar liya jaataa he
 The 'microtome' device is used for this task
 jivit utak kaa itnaa sookshm viched tab tak sambhav nahin hota, jab tak vah kadaa na ho
 Hence, to harden the tissue, it is stabilized in a solution of special types of chemicals
 sthayeekaran ke uparaant is utak ko alkohalon ke vibhinn gholon, abhiranjakon tathaa anya rasayanon main upachaar karke nirjal kar liya jaataa he
 In the end, it is pre-melted and put at a special temperature
 kuch samay baad mom ke saath hi utak ke tukdon ko chaturbhujakar saanche main daal diya jaataa he
 When the wax hardens, its smaller pieces are cut
 ant main in tukdon ko microtome ke vishesh bhaag main jamaakar usamen ek ati dhardaar chaaku se vishesh motaai ke anek section kaat liye jate hai
 These sections are kept on glass strips and kept for study
 kaanch kii pattiyon ko heating plate par rakhkar unka mom galaa liya jaataa he or utak kaa section kaanch kii pattee par jam jaataa he
 Glass strips laden with these sections are sterilized in special chemicals and alcohol solutions
 phir ise dylin yaa cedar ud aayal main bhigo diya jaataa he
 Now this section is ready for micro-study
 in sectionon ke sookshm adhyayan ke liye bhanti-bhanti ke microscopon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays, this type of microscope is being used extensively for studying tissues
 is sookshm adhyayan ke liye ootikirasayan or vikiran swachitran vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jane laga he
 Under chemotherapy, the chemical composition of various parts of tissues is studied
 vikiran swachitran vidhi main jivit jatu ke vishesh utak main vishesh prakaar ke radioisotopon kaa pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 In this way, the untreated tissues are removed from the animal body and made into sections
 in sectionon ko dark room main le jaakar photography ke vishesh rasayanon dwaara anulepit kar lete hai, yaa film ke neeche rakhkar majbootee se band dete hai
 After some time they are taken out of the dark chamber and stabilized
 tatpashchaat inhen prakaash main laakar inkaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Tissues are studied to gain knowledge of their microstructure
 at: utki kii sanrachana kaa sankshipt ullekh aavashyak he
 Three types of main components are seen in the structure of tissues: cells, matrix and fluid
 utakon kii ikai koshika hoti he

 lagbhag 2001 main shuruyaat karte hue is udyog ne in ekikrut samaadhaanon ko sanderbhit karne ke liye udhyam saamagree prabandhan naamak shabdaawalee kaa prayog karnaa shuru kar diya
 In 2006, Microsoft and Oracle Corporation entered the "value" market segment of ECM
 webajiuai, alphresco, sensonet, ijed publish, nolej tree, jampar 2
0, nuksiyo or plone sahit open sorce isiem utpaada bhi uplabdh hai
 Government standards including HIPAA, SAS 70, BS 7799 and ISO / IEC 27001 are factors in the development and use of ECM
 maanakon kaa anupaalan pramanit seva pradaataaon ke liye outsorcing ko aantarik isiem ke upyog ke liye ek vyaavhaarik vikalp bana sakate hai
 Content management includes ECM, web content management, content syndication and media asset management
 udhyam saamagree prabandhan ek closed-system samaadhaan yaa ek vishisht utpaada shrenee nahin he
 ECM is therefore just a possible catch-all term for a wide range of technologies and vendors, with document related technologies or document life cycle management
 aaj kii baahar kii ore nirdeshit web portal kii saamagree or sanrachana kal kii aantarik soochna pranali ke liye ek manch hoga
 In his article computerwatch, Ulrich Kampfmeyer summarized ECM as three key ideas that distinguish such solutions from web content management
 udhyam saamagree prabandhan tabhi thik se kaam karata he jab yah upyogkartaaon ke saamne prabhavi dhang se "adrishy" rahata he
 ECM technologies are basic facilities that support specialized applications as subordinate services
 is prakaar isiem buniyadi ghatakon kaa ek sangrah he jo bahu-stareey model main feet hoti he or jisamen upyog karne, saunpane or vyavasthit aankadon evam avyavasthit jaankariyon ke sanyukt rup se prabandhan ke liye sabhi dastavej sambandhi takneekein shaamil hoti hai
 As such, enterprise content management is one of the basic components required for an additional e-business application area
 isiem ek dablusiem kii sabhi jaankaree ke prabandhan kii bhi suvidha detaa he or ek saarvbhaumik sangraahak ke rup main sangrahan kii aavashyaktaaon ko bhi shaamil karata he
 ECM combines components that can also be used as independent systems without incorporating them into an enterprise-based system
 eim dwaara pehali baar paanch isiem ghatakon evam takneekon ko capchar, manage, store, pressrv or deliver ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya tha
 Capture involves some or all types of digitizing, copying or adding, cleaning and indexing / classification of documents
 istemaal kii ja rahi takneekon main saadhaaran jaankaree praapt karne se lekar swachaalit vargeekaran tak shaamil hote hai
 The components of capture are often also called input components
 pehle dastauez swachaalan pranaliyaan microfils yaa microphiche par bhandaaran ke liye dastavejon kii tasviren khinchati thim
 Optical scanners now produce digital copies of paper documents
 digital rup main pehle se maujuud dastavejon ko copy kiya ja saktaa he yaa agar ve pehle se online uplabdh hon to link joda ja saktaa he
 Automatic or semi-automatic capture can use EDI or XML documents as sources, business and ERP applications, or existing specialist application systems
 vibhinn manyata sambandhi takneekon ko scan kiye gaye dastavezon or digital faixon se jaankaree nikaalane ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, jinamein shaamil hai: Image cleanup features include rotation, straightening, color adjustment, replacement, zoom, aligning, page stripping, comments, and despeckling
 forms capchar main takneekon ke do samooh maujuud hai, haalanki soochna saamagree or dastavejon kaa charitra ek samaan ho saktaa he
 Forms processing is the capture of printed forms through scanning; Identification techniques are often used here, as well-designed forms enable automatic processing to a large extent
 automatic processing kaa istemaal electronic formon ko capchar karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jaise ki web pejon ke jariye jamaa kiye gaye form, jab tak ki leout, sanrachana, tark or samagriyon ke bare main capchar pranali ko jaankaree hoti he
 The Computer Output to Laser Disk records reports and other documents on optical disks or in any form of digital storage for ongoing management by ECM systems
 iske liye ek or shabd udhyam report prabandhan he
 Originally this technique only worked with laserdisks; The name was not changed even after laserdiscs were replaced by other techniques
 ekatrikaran dastavejon ko vibhinn aplicationon se jodta he
 Its goal is to unify data from various sources and forward them to storage and processing systems in a uniform structure and format
 anukraman khoj main sudhaar karata he or jaankariyon ko vyavasthit karne ke liye vaikalpik tareeke se pradaan karata he
 Manual indexing provides hands-on features of the index database by hand, specifically the content used by the database of a "manageable" component for administration and access
 Manual indexing may use input designs to limit the information to be included; For example, the entry mask may use program logic or block inputs based on other information known about the document
 swachaalit or hastchalit donon visheshtaon ke anukraman ko purvanirdhaarit input-dizin prophilon ke saath aasaan or behatar banaaya ja saktaa he; ye un dastavejon ke virgon kaa varnan kar sakati hai jo sambhavit index maanon ko simit karti hai yaa kuch khaas mandandon ko swatah lagu karti hai
 Automated classification programs can extract indexes, ranges, and transfer data freely
 electronic soochna sambandhi vastuon main maujuud jaankariyon ke aadhaar par swachaalit vargeekaran yaa shreneebaddh karnaa, purvanirdhaarit maandand yaa ek swayan-seekhney kii prakriya ke aadhaar par jaankariyon kaa moolyankan kar saktaa he
 This technique can be used with ocr-converted faxes, office files, or output files
 prabandhan shrenee main paanch paaramparik aplicoshan kshetra shaamil hai: The management category adds other components that can be used jointly or separately
 dastauez prabandhan, web saamagree prabandhan, sahyog, kaary pragati or vyavsaay prakriya prabandhan, jaankariyon ke jeevanchakra ke gatisheel hisse par kaam karata he
 Records management focuses on the management of documents finalized according to the organization's document retention policy, which in turn requires it to comply with government orders and industry practices
 prabandhan ke sabhi ghatak databeson ko shaamil karte hai or pramann pranaaliyon tak pahunch banaate hai
 Management components are offered individually or integrated as suites
 kai maamalon main ve pehle se hi "store" ghatakon ko shaamil karte hai
 Document management, in this context, largely means control of documents from creation to archiving
 dastauez prabandhan main is tarah ke kaary shaamil hai: However, with other components of document management "management", "library services" are being used more and more to control office applications such as Microsoft Outlook and Exchange, or Lotus Notes and Domino and information storage
 ek isiem pranali main sahyog ke ghatak upyogkartaaon ko ek duusare ke saath saamagree ko viksit karne or prakriya main laane main madad karte hai
 Many of these components were developed from collaborative software or groupware packages; ECM collaborative systems go much further than this and include elements of information management
 isiem pranaliyaan un jaankaree ke databeson or processing ke tareekon kaa istemaal karte hue sahyog kii suvidha pradaan karti hai jo ek saath ekaadhik upyogkartaaon dwaara prayog ke liye dizin kii gayi hai, yahan tak ki jab ve sabhi upyogkarta ek hi saamagree item par kaam kar rahe hai
 They use background data for processing information-based capabilities, resources, and combined information
 prashasan ke ghatakon jaise ki buddhishiltaa ke liye virtual whitboard, appointment sheduling or project prabandhan pranaaliyon, sanchaar sambandhi aplicoshan jaise ki video conferencing aadi ko isamen shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Collaborative ECM can also integrate information from other applications, which helps in joint information processing
 udhyam saamagree prabandhan web saamagree prabandhan pranaaliyon ko ekikrut kar saktaa he
 However, ECM information submitted via the web - on the Internet, extranet or a portal - should only contain data that is already present in the company, whose delivery access is controlled by authentication and storage
 is udyog main kai log web saamagree prabandhan ko isiem ke ek abhinn ang ke rup main nahin maanate hai
 Only a few examples of successful implementations exist that together manage a shared repository for documents and web content
 saamagree kii sanrachana taiyaar karne or ise vyavasthit karne ke liye bahut alag tarah kii takneekon or siddhanton kaa upyog aantarik unmukh dastauez saamagree kii tulana main bahari unmukh dastauez saamagree ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Records management, unlike traditional electronic storage systems, means the complete control of records, important information, and the data needed for company archiving
 records prabandhan bhandaaran media se swatantra he; prabandhit jaankaree ko aavashyak rup se electronic tareeke se sangrahan kii jarurat nahin hoti he, lekin yah ek paaramparik physical media par bhi ho saktaa he
 Some of the functions of records management are: kaary pragati or vyavsaay prakriya prabandhan kaaphi had tak bhinn hote hai
 There are different types of workflows: Production workflows that use predefined sequences for guidance and control processes while in an ad-hoc workflow the user independently determines the sequence of the process
 workelo ko workelo samaadhaanon yaa workelo enginon ke rup main karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he jo soochna or data ke pravaah ko niyantrit karne ke liye ek prishthbhumi seva ke rup main kaary karata he
 Workflow management includes the following tasks: iskaa uddeshy he sabhi aavashyak sansadhano ko shaamil karke jitna adhik sambhav ho prakriyaaon ko swachaalit bananaa
 Business process management goes one step further than workflow
 haalanki shabdon ko aksar aapas main adal-badal kar istemaal kiya jaataa he, bipiem kaa lakshya ek udhyam ke andar sabhi prabhavit aplicationon ko puri tarah se ekikrut karnaa, prakriyaaon kii nigaraanee or sabhi aavashyak jaankariyon kii essembling karnaa he
 The functions of BPM include: bipiem sarwar ke str par prakriya or data kii nigaraanee kii suvidha dete hue, varkelo kii purna kaaryakshmata pradaan karata he
 Enterprise application integration is used to connect relationships with various applications
 niyam sanrachanaon ke saath vyapaar sambandhi kushaagratha, soochna ke godaamon ko ekikrut karti he or upyogkartaaon ko inke kaary main madad karne vaali upyogitaayen pradaan karti hai
 Collection components temporarily store information that is not required or desired to be stored
 yahan tak ki agar sangrah ke ghatak un sadhano kaa upyog karte hai jo dirghakaalik sangrah ke liye upyukt hai, "sangrah" ab bhi "suraksha" se alag he
 The components of a collection can be divided into three categories: repositories, as storage locations, library services, as administrative components for repositories, and collection techniques
 These basic components are sometimes placed at the operating system level and include security technologies that work together with "delivered" components
 haalanki pahunch niyantran sahit suraksha takneekein ek isiem samaadhaan ke variyata praapt ghatak hai
 a variety of ECM repositories can be used jointly
 sambhavit prakaaron main shaamil hai: Library services are the administrative components of the ECM system that handle access to information
 librari seva prapti or prabandhan ke ghatakon se soochnaaon ko praapt karne or sanchay ke liye jimmedaar hai
 It manages storage locations in dynamic storage, in real "collections" and long-term protected collections
 The place of storage is determined only by the characteristics and classifications of the information
 librari seva khoj or punarprapti ke liye aavashyak kaaryon kii suvidha pradaan karne ke liye prabandhan database ke ghatakon ke saath milakar kaam karti he
 While the database does not "know" the address of the actual location of an accumulated object, the library service manages online storage, near-term storage, and offline storage
 agar dastauez prabandhan pranali apni kaaryakshmata pradaan nahin karti he to niyantrit soochna vyavastha ke liye soochna sthiti ko niyantrit karne or aagaman / nirgaman ke kram main librari seva ke paas aavashyak rup se sanskaran prabandhan kii suvidha maujuud honi chahie
 The library service produces logs for the use and editing of information that is called an "audit trail"
 ek vyapak vividhta kii takneekon ko soochna ke sangrah ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jo aplicoshan or pranali ke parivesh par nirbhar karata he: The material is eventually stopped from changing and becomes stable
 isiem ke sangrakshan ghatak dirghakaalik, surakshit bhandaaran or sthir soochnaaon ke byaap ke saath-saath un jaankariyon ke asthaayee bhandaaran ko sanchalit karte hai, jinhen sanchit karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Electronic storage is a related concept that has broader functionality than ECM protection components
 electronic sangrahan pranaaliyon main aam taur par prashasnic softwaron kaa ek sanyukt rup shaamil hota he jaise ki records prabandhan, imaging yaa dastauez prabandhan, librari sevaayen yaa soochna punarprapti pranaliyaan or bhandaaran sambandhi up-pranaliyaan
 Other forms of media are also suitable for long term storage
 agar ichha keval jaankaree kii bhavishya main uplabdhta sunishchit karne kii he to microfils ab bhi vyaavhaarik he; kai digital recordon ke vipareet microfils kisi aise vishesh software kii pahunch ke bagaiyr padhane yogya he jisase yah bana he
 Hybrid systems combine microfilm with electronic media and database-supported access
 lambii avadhi kii bhandaaran pranaaliyon ko nirantar badalte takneekee paridrishy main jaankariyon ko uplabdh rakhane ke kram main data migration ke samyaanusaar yojana nirmaan or niyamit kaary pradarshan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As storage technologies go out of use, it becomes necessary to transfer information to new forms of storage, so that access to stored information using contemporary systems remains
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar flopy discs drive ab aasaani se uplabdh nahin hai to flopy discs par sanchit data anivaary rup se bekaar ho jaataa he; flopy discs par sanchit data ko compact discs main sthanantarit karne se naa keval data kaa sangrakshan hota he balki ise praapt karnaa bhi sambhav ho jaataa he
 This continuous process is called continuous migration
 sangrakshan ke ghatakon main special vyler, roopantaran or migration tuls evam dirghakaalik bhandaaran media shaamil hai
 Various strategies are used in electronic storage to secure the long term availability of information
 aplicoshan, index data, metadata or puraani pranaaliyon se vastuon ko nayi pranaaliyon main nirantar sthanantaran bahut se kaary utpann karata he lekin soochna kii pahunch or upyogita surakshit karata he
 During this process, information that is no longer relevant can be deleted
 sanchit jaankariyon ke swarup ke apadet karne ke liye jahaan aavashyak ho, roopantaran takneekon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Emulation of older software allows users to handle and access basic data and objects
 special vyler software sangrakshit vastuon ke swaroop kii pahchaan kar saktaa he or vastuon ko nae software parivesh main pradarshit kar saktaa he
 Standards for interfaces, metadata, data structures, and objective formats are important to secure the availability of information
 isiem ke deliver ghatak prabandhan, sangrahan, bhandaaran or sangrakshan ghatakon se jaankaree prastut karte hai
 The AIIM component models for ECM are task-based and do not implement a strict hierarchy; The Deliver component may include functions used to transfer information to other systems
 The Deliver class functionality is also known as "output"; Techniques in this category are often called output management
 deliver ghatak teen samoohon main vibhakt hote hai: roopantaran takanic, suraksha takanic or vitaran 
 sevaaon ke rup main roopantaran or suraksha madhyasth kaa kaam karte hai or inhen sabhi isiem ghatakon main saamaan rup se uplabdh hona chahie
 Two functions are mainly important for output: layout and design, with tools for designing and formatting output, including applications that present information for distribution and publication
 roopantaran hameshaa niyantrit or pataa lagane yogya hona chahie
 This is done through background services that the end user usually cannot see
 roopantaran takneekon main shaamil hai: Security techniques are available for all ECM components
 udhaaharan ke liye, electronic hastakshar kaa istemaal na keval dastavejon ko bheje jate samay kiya jaataa he balki capchar kii purnataa ko darj karne ke kram main scanning ke madhyam se data capchar karne main bhi hota he
 Public key infrastructure is a basic technology for electronic signatures
 yah kunjiyon or praaanpatron kaa prabandhan karata he or hastakshar kii pramanikta kii jaanch karata he
 Other electronic signatures confirm the identity of the sender and the correctness of the sent data, ie that it is complete and unchanged
 europe main alag-alag gunvattta or suraksha vaale electronic hastakshar ke teen swarup hote hai: simple, advanced or qualiphoid
 adhikansh europea rajyon main qualiphoid electronic hastakshar kanoonee dastavejon or anubandhon main kanoonee taur par maanya hai
 Digital rights management and watermarking are used in content syndication and media asset management to manage and protect intellectual property rights and copyrights
 digital adhikaar prabandhan electronic watermarks jaisi takneekon ke saath kaam karata he jinhen sidhe taur par fil main ekikrut kiya gaya hota he or jinke liye upyog ke adhikaar kii suraksha or internet par prakashit saamagree kii suraksha kii jarurat hoti he
 All of the above technologies help users deliver the contents of an ECM through various routes in a controlled and user-oriented manner
 ye sakriy ghatak ho sakate hai jaise ki i-mail, data media, memo or websiton evam portels par niskriy prakaashan, jahaan upyogkarta jaankariyon ko swayan praapt kar sakate hai
 Possible output and distribution media include: deliver ke vibhinn ghatak die gaye aplicoshan ke liye upyogkartaaon ko jitna adhik sambhav ho iske upyog ko niyantrit karte hue behatar tareeke se jaankaree pradaan karte hai
 According to Gartner, as of 2009, the main trends in the ECM market that IT architects, planners and business leaders should keep in mind are the following: Template: Close paraphrasing 2009 gartner isiem magic quadrent dwaara manyata praapt vikritaon main shaamil hai alfresco, autonomi, de software, iemasi, evar team, fabasoft, echpi, hiland software, ibiem, letherphiche, microsoft, nujen software technologies, objective corporation, open text, orecle, paraseptive software, esaypi, saparion, siyaav, springsiem, sanguard, systamaware, xerox or jaaythos software
 Prior to 2003, the ECM market was dominated by a number of medium-sized independent vendors that fell into two categories: vendors that originally emerged as document management companies and began to add other enterprise content management, and vendors Who started out as web content management providers and other types of content such as business documents And started efforts to spread its branches in the management of rich media
 ibiem or orecle jaise bade vikritaon ne bhi is kshetra main peshkash kii thi or market share kaaphi had tak banta hua rahaa tha
 In 2002, Documentum added collaboration capabilities with the acquisition of e-room, while Interviewan and Vignette confronted them with their respective acquisitions of imanage and Intraspect
 isi tarah documentum ne apni digital sampatti prabandhan kshamtaaon ke liye bulldog ko kharida tha jabaki kshamtaaon jabaki intervuvan or opentext ne mediabin or artesia ke adhigrahan ke saath unka muqabla kiya tha
 opentext also acquired European companies IXOS and Red Dot to shore up its software portfolio
 oktober 2003 main iemasi corporation ne documentum kaa adhigrahan kiya tha
 emc's major competitors in the database sector soon responded when in 2006 IBM bought filenet and Oracle bought Stellant
 opentext also bought Hummingbird in 2006
 hulett-packard entered the field of ECM in 2008 with its acquisition of the Australian company Tower Software
 march 2009 main autonomi ne intervuvan ko kharida or july 2009 main open text ne vignet kaa adhigrahan kiya
 In April 2007, independent analyst firm CMS Watch noted that "some big names in this business are adopting the necessary transformation that will lead to the transfer of road maps and product sets over the next few years"
 Also in 2007, Nuccio and Alfresco The sequence of emergence of open-source options for ECM supplied by SEE was seen, with software-as-a-service support from Spring CM Was Sks

 There are many software companies that have taken rapid steps towards developing applications to help ECM with specific utilities and features
 kai aisi companiyaan hai jo third party document or image vynurs kii seva pradaan karti hai jaise ki lead technologies, emes technology or acusoft
 aisi companiyaan bhi hai jo workfloj kii seva pradaan karti hai jaise ki offis gemini, spring siem or dock acist
 kai companiyaan isiem ke liye plugains kii suvidha bhi pradaan karti hai

 Gartner estimates that the ECM market was worth approximately $ 3
3 billion in 2008; By 2013, it was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9
5 percent
 udyog samekan ke ek bahutayat ke baad, is kshetra main keval teen yaa chaar pramukh companiyaan shesh rah gayi thim or yah udyog kul milakar ek sampoorn badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi he jis tarah microsoft ne saamagree prabandhan ke ghatakon ko upabhokta vastuon kaa rup de diya he
 According to Gartner's 2009 report, 75 percent of the Global 2000 companies have by 2008 to implement a desktop-centric, process-focused content management and other technologies such as digital asset management and e-mail management by the ECM
 There was a lot of possibility to continue
 gartner ne yah bhi bhavishyavaanee kii he ki aage bhi vikritaon kaa plateform or samaadhaan pradaataaon main bazaar samekan, adhigrahan or pruthakkaran hoga
 Currently, the interest of organizations towards enterprise information management is increasing and they are trying to achieve information management in the perspective of an enterprise
 iiem, isiem or vyavsaayik bauddhikta ko jodatii he
 Cloud content management is emerging as a web-based alternative combining the content focus of ECM with collaborative elements of social business software
