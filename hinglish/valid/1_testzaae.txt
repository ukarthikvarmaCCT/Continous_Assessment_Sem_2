 When this news reached the Indian media, it started presenting it daily by making it headstrong
 is 'braking news' kaa upyog vipaksh ne bhi koob kiya
 He sent a message to the public that in the Rs 60 crore brokerage, Rajiv Gandhi's government was running away from the investigation
 rajeev gandhi ko bhartiya nyaayalay ne clin chit bhi pradaan kar di
 The 1989 elections also came in the limelight for the Bofors scandal
 ve
 pi
 singh or vipaksh ne ise chunavi mudde ke rup main pesh kiya
 Although preliminary investigation has proved that no allegations have been made against Rajiv Gandhi by the Auditor General, the Auditor General had undoubtedly raised the credibility of the cannons
 bhartiya janata ke madhya yah baat spasht ho gai ki bofars topein vishwasaniyan nahin hai to saude main dallali lee gai hogi
 In such a situation, the target was to be made by Rajiv Gandhi and his government

 pi
 singh ne janata ke madhya jaakar yah dushprachaar karnaa armbh kar diya ki congress sarkaar main sheersh str par bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 This is why bureaucracy and bureaucracy have become corrupt
 ucch str par bhrashtachar ke daawey ne bharat ke sabhi virgon ko chaunkaa diya
 VP Singh's words sounded to him like the true word of Satyavadi Harishchandra
 ve
 pi
 singh ne chunaav kii tithi ghoshit hone ke baad jansabhaon main daawa kiya ki boforce topon kii dallali kii raqam 'lotus' naamak videshi bank main jamaa karai he or vah satta main aane ke baad puure prakaran kaa kulasa kar denge
 The accuser, who was the surveyor of the Ministry of Finance and Defense in the Congress, was making this accusation, due to this the proletariat accepted that there must be truth in the claims of VP Singh
 ab yahan yah kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he ki ve
 pi
 singh dwaara rajeev gandhi ke prati dushprachaar kaa uddeshy satta tak pahunchnaa hi tha
 In this election truth and honesty were sacrificed and lies misled people
 yahi manovigyaan bhi he ki yadi koi jhooth baar-baar aapke kaanon main padataa he to ek din aap use sach maane lete hai
 The same thing happened in the case of the Bofors deal
 bhartiya janata ne ise sach maan liya
 Thus, in this election VP Singh's image became that of a politician whose honesty and devotion could not be doubted
 uttar pradesh ke yuvaaon ne to unhen apana nayak maan liya tha
 VP Singh lived side by side with the students
 vah motorcycle par chunaav prachaar karte chaatro ke saath ho lete the
 He also avoided car rides as much as possible to represent himself as an ordinary person
 falswaroop iskaa sarthak prabhaav dekhne ko praapt hua
 On the one hand VP Singh created the image of his truthful Harishchandra among the public and on the other hand he started the work of breaking the Congress

 pi
 singh ne sampark karnaa armbh kar diya
 He wanted the dissident Congress to break away from Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress Party

 Arif Muhammad and Rajiv Gandhi were very close to each other but an incident created a gap between them
 darasal hua yah ki hyderabad main shahbaano ko uske pati dwaara talaaq dene ke baad maamla adaalat tak ja pahunchaa
 The court considered the Muslim woman Shahbano eligible for subsistence allowance
 lekin muslim kattarpanthi chaahate the ki 'muslim personal lau' ke aadhaar par hi faisla kiya jaae
 For this reason, this dispute had caught a lot of momentum
 aisi sthiti main rajeev gandhi ne aarif mohammad se kaha ki vah ek zordaar abhiyaan chalaakar logon ko samajhaayen ki muslimon ko nayaa kaanoon maananaa chahie or 'muslim vyaktigat kaanoon' par nirbhar nahin rahanaa chahie

 The Left parties also announced their support to the front
 is prakaar saat dalon ke morche kaa nirmaan 6 agast 1988 ko hua or 11 oktober 1988 ko rashtriya morcha kaa vidhivat gathan kar liya gaya
 1989 Lok Sabha Elections complete
 congress ko baari kshati uthaani padi
 It got only 197 seats
 vishwanath pratap singh ke rashtriya morche ko 146 siten milin
 The BJP and the Left parties expressed their intention to support the National Front
 tab bhaajapa ke paas 86 saansad the or vamadalon ke paas 52 saansad
 Thus the National Front got the support of 248 members
 ve
 pi
 singh swayan ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bataa rahe the
 He felt that the defeat of Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress was possible only because of him
 lekin chandrasekhar or devilal bhi pradhanmantri pad kii daud main shariq ho gaye
 In such a situation, it was decided that VP Singh would be crowned as Prime Minister and Chaudhary Devi Lal would be made the Deputy Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri banate hi unhone sikhon ke ghaav par maraham rakhane ke liye swarna mandir kii ore daud lagaai
 Personally, Vishwanath Pratap Singh was very clean-hearted and his image as Prime Minister was of a strong and social political visionary
 unhone mandal kamishan kii siforeeshon ko maanakar desh main vanchit samudaayon kii satta main hissedari par mohar laga di
 VP Singh died at the age of 77 on 27 November 2008 at Apollo Hospital in Delhi

 This includes physical, chemical, and biological processes of removing physical, chemical and biological contaminants
 iskaa uddeshy ek apshisht pravaah or ek thos apshisht yaa keechad kaa utpaadan karnaa he jo vaataavaran main nirvahan yaa punarprayog ke liye upyukt hota he
 This material is often inadvertently contaminated with many toxic organic and inorganic compounds
 malajal kii utpatti awasaiya, sansthagat or vanijyik evam audyogic pratishthanon se hoti he or isamen shauchalayon, snanagharon, bauchhaaron, rasoigharon, haujon ityadi se nikalne vaale gharelu apshisht drav shaamil hai jo malajal naaliyon ke madhyam se nishkasit hote hai
 Sewage in many areas also contains waste fluids from industry and commerce
 dhoosar jal evam kaale jal ke rup main gharelu apshisht kaa algaav evam nikasi aaj ke viksit vishwa ke liye bahut aam hota ja rahaa he or saath main dhoosar jal kaa istemaal paudhon main pani dene ke liye kiya ja rahaa he yaa shauchalayon ko jal se saafe karne ke liye inkaa punarchakran kiya ja rahaa he
 Most of the sewage also includes surface water coming out of rooftops or parking lots and may also contain effluent storm water
 tufaani jal se nipatane main sakasham malajal nikaas pranaaliyon ko sanyukt pranaaliyon yaa sanyukt malajal naaliyon ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Such systems are usually avoided because of their seasonality, which complicate the process of sewage treatment and thus reduce the capacity of sewage treatment plants
 pravaahee parivartanshiltaa kii vajah se bhi prashodhan suvidhaayen aksar aavashyaktaa se adhik badi or baad main adhik mahangi ho jaati he
 In addition, heavy storms that provide more water flow than the capacity of the treatment plant can have a major impact on the sewage treatment system causing water spillage or overflow
 aadhunik malajal naalee vikaas ke tahat varsha jal ke liye alag se tufaani jal naalee pranaaliyon kii vyavastha uplabdh karaane kii pravriti apanaayi ja rahi he
 Since rainwater flows over the students and onto the ground, it also carries with it various contaminated substances including soil particles and other sediments, heavy metals, organic compounds, animal waste and oil and onion
 kuch ilaakon main is tufaani jal ko sidhe jalmargon main nishkasit karne se pehle ise prashodhan ke kuch staron se guzarana jaruri he
 Examples of treatment processes used for stormwater include sedimentation basins, wetlands, various types of filtration and intercalated solid domes, and circular separators
 alag swatchta naaliyon main koi tufaani jal shaamil nahin hona chahie
 Sanitary drains are generally much smaller than stormwater drains and are not designed to carry stormwater
 yadi nimnataleey kshetron main swatchta naalee pranali main atyadhik tufaani jal ko nishkasit kiya gaya to vahaan aprishkrut malajal kaa jamaav ho saktaa he
 Sewage treatment can be done in the vicinity of where it originates, or can be stored through a network of pipes and pump stations and transported to municipal treatment plants
 malajal sangrah or prashodhan aamtaur par sthaneey, raji or sangheey viniyamon evam maanakon ke adheen he
 Wastewater from industrial installations often requires special treatment processes
 paaramparik malajal prashodhan main teen charan shaamil ho sakate hai, jinhen praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak prashodhan kaha jaataa he
 Under the primary treatment, sewage is temporarily kept in a dormant basin where heavy solids settle down and freeze while oil, onion and light solids float on the surface
 neeche baithe or upar tairte padaarthon ko hataa diya jaataa he or shesh taral padaarth ko nishkasit kiya ja saktaa he yaa dwitiyak prashodhan main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Secondary treatment removes dissolved and suspended organic matter
 dwitiyak prashodhan aamtaur par ek prabandhit sthaan main swadeshi, jal janit sookshm jeevon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Under secondary treatment, an isolation process may be required to expel the treated water before it is expelled or used in tertiary treatment
 tritiyak prashodhan ko kabhi-kabhi praathmik or dwitiyak prashodhan se thodaa badhkar mana jaataa he
 The treated water is sometimes chemically or physically disinfected before releasing it into a stream, river, bay, lagoon, or wetland, or to irrigate a golf field, green walkway, or park
 Can be used
 yadi yah paryaapt rup se saafe he, to ise bhumigat jal punarbharan yaa krishigat prayojanon ke liye bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Under pre-treatment, the effluent from the primary treatment pumps and removes materials that can be easily collected from the raw waste water, damaging or obstructing the pumps
 malajal dhara main bahane vaale sabhi badi vastuon ko hataane ke liye antakpravahee malajal ko chaanaa jaataa he
 This work is most commonly performed in modern plants serving a very large population with the help of an automated mechanized dielectric filtering filter, while in relatively smaller or less modern plants a manual clean filter may be used
 ek yantric avarohak chanani kii ekathran kriya aam taur par avarohak chanani par jamaav or / yaa pravaah dar ke anusaar dhimi gati ke aadhaar par hoti he
 The solids are collected and later used for any landfill or burnt to ashes
 thos padaarthon ko hataane kii kriya ko anukool banane ke liye alag-alag aakaar vaale avarohak chanani yaa jalinuma chanani kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Filtration is the first step in any sewage treatment plant, in which sewage is flowed through a variety of filtration, so that the sewage, paper, wood, kitchen waste is present in the sewage
 Etc
 such as substances flowing over the water can be trapped and removed
 yadi in behate hue padaarthon ko nahin hataaya gaya to ye pipon ko jam kar denge yaa malajal pampon ke kaam par pratikul prabhaav daalenge
 is prakaar chanani uplabdh karaane kaa mukhya uddeshy malajal main behate hue padaarthon kii vajah se hone vaale sambhavit nuksaanon se pampon or anya upkarnon kii raksha karnaa he
 It should be installed beyond the pebble chambers
 lekin yadi kankadon kii gunvattta bahut zyada myne nahin rakhti ho jaisaa ki bhoomi bharaav ke maamle main hota he, to in chaananiyon ko kankad kakshon ke baad bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he
 These can sometimes be accommodated in the main part of the pebble chambers themselves
 purv-prashodhan main ek baaluu yaa kankad channel yaa kaksh nihit ho saktaa he jahaan baaluu, kankad or pattharon ke jamaav ke liye aagat apshisht jal ke veg ko samyojit kiya jaataa he
 These particles are removed because they can damage the wastewater treatment center pumps and other mechanical equipment
 ho saktaa he ki chote-chote swatchta malajal pranaaliyon ke liye, kankad kakshon kii jarurat na pade, lekin bade-bade sanyantron main kankad hataav vaanchhneeya he
 In the primary sedimentation phase, sewage flows through large tanks, commonly called "primary clarifiers" or "primary sedimentation tanks"
 in tankiyon kaa istemaal keechad ke jamaav ke liye kiya jaataa he jabaki ongan evam tel sataha par uth jate hai or unhen upar se hataa liya jaataa he
 Primary deposition tanks are usually equipped with mechanically operated scraper which continuously moves the collected sludge to a hopper located in the base of the tank from where it is sent to sludge treatment centers
 sabunikaran ke liye kabhi-kabhi behate hue padaarthon se ongan or tel ko nikaal liya jaataa he
 The dimensions of these tanks should be constructed in such a way that it is helpful in the removal of excessive amounts of flowing materials and sludge
 ek vishisht avsaadan tank, malajal ke prasupt thos padaarthon main se 60 se 65 pratishat or biodi main se 30 se 35 pratishat apshisht padaarthon ko hataa sakati he
 Secondary treatment is designed to substantially reduce the organic matter of sewage generated from human waste, food waste, soap and detergents
 nagarpalika ke adhikansh sanyantron main viviya jaivik prakriyaaon kaa istemaal karke malajal main jame hue rasayanon ko prashodhit kiya jaataa he
 Both oxygen and food are essential for the living world to remain functional and survive
 jeevanu or protozoa swaabhaavik rup se sadansheel ghulansheel carbonic sandooshit padaarthon kaa upbhog karte hai or kam ghulansheel padaarthon main se adhikansh padaarthon ko floke main parivartit kar dete hai
 Secondary treatment systems are classified into the following forms niyat film yaa sanlagn vruddhi pranali kii prashodhan prakriya main risaav filter or aavarti jaivik melak shaamil hote hai jahaan jaev padaarth madhyam taiyaar karata he or malajal isaki sataha par se gujarata he
 In latent-growth systems, such as catalyzed sludge, the biomass is mixed with sewage and can operate in a smaller space than fixed film systems that treat water of similar magnitude
 haalanki, niyat film pranaliyaan, jaivik padaarthon kii maatra main hone vaale prabal parivartanon kaa saamana karne main adhik sakasham hoti hai or prasupt vruddhi pranaaliyon kii tulana main ye adhik carbonic padaarth or prasupt thos padaarthon kaa hataav kar sakati hai
 Asymmetric filters are intended to purify particularly rigid or variable organic mixtures, typically industrial mixtures, so that they can then be easily treated by conventional secondary treatment processes
 iske abhilakshanon main apshisht jal ko pravaahit kiye jane vaale madhyam se yukt filter shaamil hote hai
 They are designed in such a way that it facilitates high hydraulic loading and high level aeration
 bade-bade pratishthanon main dhaunkaniyon kaa istemaal karke media ke madhyam se hawa ko pravesh kiya jaataa he
 The resulting wastewater is generally counted within the normal range of conventional treatment processes

 sampatti shabd kaa aashay, isse sambandhit anya vichaaron se, jinhen "vastu" yaa "res", "domus" tathaa "swami" aadi shabdon se vyakt kiya gaya, viksit hua
 According to linguistics the term property is derived from the Latin adverb "possessor"
 iskaa vikaas "proprirts" naamak shabd se hua
 The word proprietis came to be used on an intellectual level by Roman legalists and was used in the colloquial language of France
 dhire dhire sampatti shabd kaa upyog bhoomi, dhan tathaa anya moolyawaan vastuon ke liye hone laga
 The meaning of the word "property" is definite when the term came to be used to express the relation of a family and objects belonging to its members

 Mancipium means acquisition, possession, especially land
 "mainsipium" shabd lagbhag sanskrit ke "grah" shabd ke hi samaan he
 In Roman, "dominium" or "propiratus" refers to a set of rights that signify ownership
 samay ke saath saath "swatv" kaa vikaas hua or dhire dhire iskaa aashay kisi vastu kaa swatantra upyog or use bhejne yaa de daalane kaa adhikaar samajha jane laga

 Gradually, the religious form of property disappeared
 mitakshra ke anusaar sampatti ihloki vastu he kyonki iskaa upyog sansaarik len dein ke liye hota he
 According to the commentators of Manusmriti, the meaning of property in the Aryans was related to the whole family, which included sons, daughters, wife and slaves
 samaaj ke vikaas ke saath putr, putree tathaa patni ko sampatti kii vastu yaa sampatti kaa ang na samajhakar unhen sampatti se pruthak astitv kii manyata di gai
 The legal suffix of flat in Indian law is the same as in English jurisprudence
 angreji kanoon bahut kuch roman kanoon se prabhavit he
 The word "property" can have many meanings, such as ownership or ownership, that is, the complete right of the owner
 kabhi kabhi iskaa arth roman "res" hota he jise antargat swaamitv ke adhikaar kaa prayog hota he jiske antargat swaamitv ke adhikaar kaa prayog hota he arthath swayan vah vastu jo ukt adhikaar kaa vishay yaa paatr he
 The human meaning of "race" or "object" has helped in the development of the nature of property
 is prakaar "res" athwa "vastu" par adhikaar kaa sambodh or swayan "res" yaa "vastu" kaa sambodh sapatti sambandhi pratyay se jatil tathaa gahare rup se sambhddha he arthath donon ek duusare ke poorak or sahaayak he
 The meaning of "race" in Roman is extremely complex
 yah angreji kii tarah adhikaar kii thos vastu he
 But "race" is not exactly the same meaning as "object", it is more than that
 yadhyapi "res" kaa mul arth bhautik vastu he, parantu dhire dhire iskaa prayog aisi parisampatti ko vyakt karne ke liye bhi hone laga jo bhautik tathaa sthool hi na hokar amoort bhi ho sakati thi jaise bijli
 "race" is also used for exclusive rights and also for rights that arise, for example, from fame or fame
 is prakaar in do artho ke liye res kaa lagaataar prayog hone ke kaaran "res" ke do arth ho gaye : "res parthiv" arthath bhautik vastuen jo manushya ke adhikaron ke antargat aa sakati he tathaa "res aparthiv" arthath ve adhikaar swayan
 Thus, as a result of the final analysis, "object" will be taken to mean "race earth"
 roman bhashaa main "res" sampatti kii vastu tathaa adhikaar donon ke liye prayukt hota he, parantu "bona" shabd, jo saamaan yaa dhan ke liye prayukt hota he, sanskrit ke "dhan" shabd ke samakaksh he
 According to Arabic jurors the word "goods" can be used for property and any thing which has value or meaning in Arabic law or which can be in the possession of a person
 "dhan" shabd bhi sampatti ke liye bahudhaa prayukt hota he
 The object to be used in the sense of property must have the qualities of stability and physical unity
 ikaayiyon ke ek sangrah ko jisaki ikaiyaan swayan pruthak vastu hon or aisi ekal ikaayiyon ke sammilan se bani vastu ko bhi vastu kah sakate hai; jaise ek eent athwa eenton se nirmit ek makaan yaa ek bhend athwa kai bhedon se bana ek jhuden
 In law, the object is also used to express certain rights and duties
 bhautik gunon ke aadhaar par "vastu" do prakaar kii ho sakati he - chal athwa achal
 But according to the technical rules of English law, things are real and personal
 roman kanoon ke anusaar "res" ko isi prakaar "maincipebul" tathaa anamancipubul main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 In this way property is related to another "race" or "object" and on the other hand to human rights related to race or object
 isliye sampatti ke liye ek aisa vyakti aavashyak he jo kisi vastu par apana adhikaar rakh sake
 Property, according to the final analysis, expresses the relationship established between a person and an object or right, which he considers only his own
 apane aadhunik prayogon main sampatti un sabhi vastuon yaa sampada ke liye prayukt hoti he jo kisi vyakti se sambandhit ho yaa us vyakti ne kisi anya ko samarpit kar diya ho parantu apane laabh ke liye us vastu kii vyavastha karne kaa adhikaar surakshit rakhata ho
 The classification of property according to the nature of the race or object and the nature of the object or rights are classified in various ways, eg, earthly or non-living; Movable or immovable and real or personal
 sampatti ke saath anya vishisht shabdon jaise vyaktigat yaa saarvajanik, paitruk, daayayogy, sanyukt paariwarik, samadhikarik aadi ke sanyukt kar dene se sampatti ke swaroop ke saath sambandh vyakt hota he
 According to the statutory interpretation of property it has many meanings
 sampatti ke antargat kisi vyakti ke dwaara kiye gaye shaareerik tathaa maansik parishram ke fal bhi aate hai
 Any person gets whatever he gets in exchange for something he is given and whatever is considered by the law or given the right to use, enjoy and arrange it, All is called that person's personal property
 parantu kanoon dwaara manyata na praapt hone par use sampatti nahin kaha ja saktaa or tab vidhik parinaam kii drushti se vyakti or vastu ke bich koi sambandh nahin rah jaataa he
 Rawal Ratnasinh was the ruler of Chittor
 inkaa shasankaal alpakaalik tha
 Ratna Singh was a worthy mighty ruler among the two sons of Samar Singh in the dynasty of Bappa Rawal, Ratna Singh's brother Kumbhakarna had already left Mewar and fled to Nepal, so Ratan Singh became the ruler who was the last ruler of the Rawal branch
 chaudaavin shatabdi ke bilkul aarambhik varshon main chittor kii rajgaddi par baithe the
 His special fame has been in the name of King Ratansen in the Hindi epic Padmavat
 kuch itihaaskaar inkaa singhasanarohan 1301i0 main maanate hai to kuch 1302 i0 main
 His wife was the history-famous queen Padmini or Padmavati
 1303 i0 main allaudin khilji ke akraman se parivaar tathaa shashan sahit ye bhi nasht ho gayi
 After the rule of only one year and with the end of his dynasty, his name was lost in the stories of the bhatan-bardan
 yahan tak ki inhen sroton par mukhyatah aadhaarit hone ke kaaran karnal tod ke suprasiddh rajasthan ke itihaas sambandhi granth main bhi inkaa naam tak nahin diya gaya he
 In his place, his wife Rani Padmini's relationship with Bhimsingh has been very misleading
 suprasiddh itihaaskaar mahamahopadhyaay rhibahadur gaurishankar hirachand ojha ne karnal tod kii bhul spasht karte hue rawal ratnasingh kii aitihaasikta siddh kii
 Ojha ji has clarified all the misconceptions and truth, writing that "behind Rawal Samarsingh his son Ratnasinh sat on the throne of Chittor
 us ko shashan karte thode hi maheene hue the, itane main dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne chittod par akraman kar diya or chah maheene se adhik ladane ke anantar usne kila le liya
 Some of Mewar's fame, royalty, epic and Colonel Tod's Rajasthan did not even name Ratnasinh
 summersingh ke baad karan singh kaa raja hona likhaa he, parantu karansingh summersingh ke peeche nahin, kintu usase 8 peedi pehle hua tha
 Muhnot Nainasi writes in his fame that Ratanasi fought against Alauddin in the case of Padmini; But he calls Ratnasinh at one place the son of Samarasi and the son of Ajasi at another and the brother of Bhadlakhamasi, the last of which is not believable, because Lakhmsi was not the son of Ajasi but the father and head of Sisode
 is prakaar ratnasingh lakhamasi kaa bhai nahin kintu mewar kaa swami or summersingh kaa putr tha, jaisaa ki rana kumbhakarna ke samay ke vi0 san0 1517 ke kumbhalgarh ke shilaalekh or eklingamahatmaya se paaya jaataa he
 It is also written in these two that after Samarsingh his son Ratnasinh became king
 uske maare jane par lakshmanasingh chittod kii raksharth mlecchon kaa sanhaar karata hua apane saat putron sahit maaraa gaya
 " pracheen abhilekh aadi se isse adhik ratnasingh ke sambandh main koi vivaran uplabdh nahin hota he
 Details related to Alauddin Khilji's attack are found in Amir Khusro's 'tithi Alai'
 amir khusro ke ukt granth se pataa chalata he ki sultan allaudin khilji 28 janvari 1303 i0 ko chittod lene ke liye dilli se ravaanaa hua tathaa 26 agast 1303 i0 ko kila fatah ho gaya
 In connection with the invasion of Alauddin Khilji, Mahakavi Malik Muhammad Jayasi has written in his famous epic Padmavat that this attack was to obtain Padmavati, the unique beautiful wife of King Ratansen, and after many years of siege he failed to return to Khilji
 And was victorious by attacking again
 parantu ab aitihaasik tathy saamne aa jane se itihaaskaar maanane lage hai ki akraman kaa pramukh kaaran allaudin kii samrajyavaadee mahatvakanksha evam chittod kii sainik evam vyapaarik upyogita thi
 The commercial routes of Gujarat, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh, United Provinces, Sindh etc
 passed through Chittor
 swaabhaavik he ki allaudin khilji jaisaa mahatvakankshi sultan isko avashya adhikrut karnaa chahta
 It is possible that knowing the beauty of Padmini, one of her aims has also been to achieve it
 kaaran jo bhi ho parantu allaudin ke akraman ne shashan sahit rawal ratnasingh ke jivan ko bhi nasht kar diya tathaa apni bahusankhyak sakhiyon evam anya raniyon ke saath rani padmini johar karke sati ho gayi

 The Bible is the cornerstone of Christianity and the holiest scripture of Christians
 iske do bhaag hai : purvavidhan or navvidhan 
 The first half of the Bible is also the scripture of the Old Testament Jews
 bible ishwarprerit he kintu use apaurushey nahin kaha ja saktaa
 God has inspired various writers of the Bible in such a way that they can be called their own creations even though they are Godsized
 ishwar ne bolkar unase bible nahin likhavai
 He certainly tended to write with the inspiration of God, but he has written it according to the characteristics of his culture, style and ideology
 at: bible ishwariya prerana tathaa maanviya parishram donon kaa sammilit parinaam he
 The history and account of what God did for mankind and the Jews and the reaction of man to it is the theme of the Bible
 bible gudh darshanik satyon kaa sankalan nahin he balki isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki ishwar ne maanav jati kii mukti kaa kya prabandh kiya he
 In fact, the Bible is a history of the implementation of divine liberation that began in the Old Testament and was edited by Jesus in the New Testament
 at: bible ke donon bhaagon main ghanishtha sambandh he
 The events of the life of Jesus are laid out by the events of the Old Testament
 new testament main dikhalaayaa gaya he ki muktividhan kis prakaar isa ke vyaktitv, chamatkaaron, shiksha, maran tathaa punarutthan dwaara sampann hua he; kis prakaar isa ne carch kii sthapana kii or is carch ne apane praarambhik vikaas main isa ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko kis drushti se dekha he ki unamem se kya nishkarsh nikaala he
 Incidentally, things related to cosmic knowledge have also come up in the Bible; There is a full impression of the immediate assumptions on them because the Bible hardly wants to give any direction about them
 maanav jati ke itihaas kii ishwariya vyakhya prastut karnaa or dharm evam mukti ko samajhnaa, yahi bible kaa pradhan uddeshy he, bible kii tatsambandhi shiksha main koi bhranti nahin ho sakati
 There is also a description of the sin of humans at many places
 aisa aacharan anukaraniya adarsh ke rup main nahin prastut hua he kintu uske dwaara spasht ho jaataa he ki manushya kitne kalushit hai or unako ishwar kii mukti kii kitni aavashyaktaa he
 It describes ancient Judaism and the stories of Jewish people, mythological stories, myths etc
 isaki mulbhasha ibrani or arami thi
 It is after Christ, which was written by the disciples of Jesus
 isamen isa kii jeevani, upadesh or shishyon ke kaary likhe gayi hai
 Its native language was some Aramaic and mostly colloquial Ancient Greek
 isamen khaas taur par chaar shubhasandesh hai jo isa kii jeevani kaa unke chaar shishyon ke naam se kisi or ke dwaara varnan he : matti, luka, yuhanna or marakus
 The religion book of Judaism is also the Bible, but it contains only the Old Testament
 bible kul milakar 66 granthon kaa sankalan he - purvavidhan main 39 tathaa navvidhan main 27 granth hai
 Holy bibleaudio Bible Project navvidhan ke pratham paanch granth aitihaasik hai arthath chaaron susamachar tathaa acts aav di aposles ke patt shishyon ke kaary
 The last book is called Apocalypse
 isamen susamachar lekhak sant yohan pratikatmak style main carch ke bhavishya tathaa muktividhan kii parinti kaa chitra ankit karte hai
 The remaining 21 texts of the New Testament are Shiksha-pradhan, namely 14 letters of Sant Pal, two letters of Santpeeter, three letters of the saint Yohan, the gospel writer, one letter by Saint Yakub and one by Saint Jude
 sant paal ke patr yaa to kisi sthanvishesh ke nivaasiyon ke liye likhe gaye hai yaa kisi vyaktivishesh ko 
 There is no doubt about the authenticity of the letters of the Hebrews, which are included in the Bible, but despite being influenced by the thoughts of Sant Pal, their author will be someone else
 bivil ke pramanik granthon kii uparyukt suchi main se purvavidhan ke kuch granth ibrani bible main sammilit nahin the, arthath tobias, yudith, makaabi, pragna siraah or daniel evam ester ke kuch ansh
 Jews and many Protestant denominations do not place these texts in their Bible as unproven
 praaia: samast purvavidhan kii mul bhashaa ibrani he
 Many texts have been written in the Greek language and a small fraction in Aramaic
 samast navvidhan kii bhashaa koine naamak unani bolchaal he
 The creation of the Bible dates back to 1400 BC
 It is believed to date back to 100 AD

 The texts which have been included in the Bible are written in many genres, not in the same style - folklore, poetry and hymns, sermons and fables etc
 are found in many literary forms

 The translation of the Bible has been in operation for centuries

 Many excellent authentic Greek texts of the New Testament are found, such as the versions of Tischenfarf, Westcott Hort, Nestle, Vogels, Merck, and Soter

 In 2009, Jehovah's Witnesses published a Hindi translation, the New World Translation, the Christian Greek Scriptures, and this translation is also available on their website
 bible ishwar prerit bhi he or saadhaaran manushyon kii rachana bhi he; at: isaki vyakhya main is dohare kartrutv kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Being a masterpiece of man, the Bible should be studied like other cosmic literature; Therefore isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki bible ke vyaakhyaata ke liye bible main ullikhit deshon kii vistrut jaankaree ke atirikt bhashavigyaan, itihaas, bhugol, puraatatv, dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan jaisi anek sahaayak vidhaayen atyant aavashyak hai

 Scientific interpretation of the Bible can only be meaningful according to church tradition
 bhugolic drushti se bible kaa prabhaav bahut hi vistrut he
 Maybe it is a contingency
 mulat: ek damit janata ke dharm ke rup main isiyat anek pareekshanon ke pashchaat apane vijiton kaa dharm bani
 The ancient religion of the Bible is spiritually combined with the Quran and Islam and is associated with a chosen elite
 musa athwa isa, abraham yaa suleman muslimon main shraddhey naam hai
 The Bible is different from this
 yah kai granthon kaa nichod he
 This is the entire story of the Jewish people and perhaps the most varied Jewish experiences among the ancient people
 yah aisi jati thi jo khoonkhaar kabeelon se ghiri thi or jo swayan bhi kam khoonkhaar na thi
 Sometimes they were demeaned, conquered and enslaved
 is jati ne kabhi apane shatruon ko vijit kiya tathaa unki shakti aajamaai, phir bhoomisaat kar daalaa 
 It is the aspiration and inspiration and triumph and defeat of one such public who is described in the Bible with amazing vivacity
 usne hamen apane abraham or musa jaise mahaan netaaon, daaud or suleman jaise mahaan raajaaon tathaa mahaan avtaron ke vishay main gyaan karaayaa he jinhone samay samay par utpann hokar apane drudh vachanon dwaara anuchit maarg par arudh janata ko tokaa
 It has been the same sequence till Sevanola
 unhone unki hinsaparayan vritti ko swayan bhoga liya, aalasy or krurta kii ninda kii jisaki ore janata swabhaavat: abhimukh thi
 The Bible also shows about bloodpipes like Abraham, fierce violent kings and uncivilized queens
 yah janata kii aitihaasik ghatnaon or tithiyon kii samhita he
 In the inevitable small boundaries of a book, despite its virtually ethnic history, it is full of surprising truths
 pracheen dharmaniyam kii samaapti ke saath usamen ek aakasmik parivartan hota dikhaai detaa he
 History remains the same but its nature changes
 yahudiyon kaa bhayankar ishwar hataa diya jaataa he or kalpana main bhartiya dhang kaa ek snehi ishwar ubhad aata he
 Perhaps the first blurred images of such a trend are found in some incarnations of the heart of ancient Dharmanium itself, especially in Isaiah etc
 kintu ishwar ke sambandh main yah ibranio kii koi anupatik kalpana nahin he
 His feeling was eye to eye
 lekin jab isa ne unase kaha ki ve unke daayen gaal par thappad jamaanevaale ke saamne apana bayen gaal bhi pher den, ve aise krantikari darshan or hinsa ke nipat asweekaar kii baaten na samaj sake
 Thus, he disqualified the author of this new religious belief and eventually gave it to him
 kintu us din galgotha naamak sthaan par cross se pravaahit raktabinduon kii dhara ne ek nae dharm ko janm diya
 The Christian people see him as a symbol for themselves and preach the words of Jesus
 is prakaar, buniyadi taur par dhairya or prem ne twara or ghrinaa par vijay praapt kii
 No one thought that those who indulged in the homogenously recited singing found in secret and furnished tendons or cottages inside Rome, which were previously only suitable for the sake of the deposits of the fierce Roman festivals, would one day only see the royal power of Rome We will not only shake you, but will build a better and more glorious Rome-like Sanatan Nagar in the coming days
 phir isai log cross rupi shastr se susajjit hokar tamaam rome main fail gaye
 Although here he was not a Roman corps but saints with tables and clergymen, who passed away in thousands laughing to death, he preached biblical messages among Europe's rambunctious and uncivilized people
 bible ke shabdon ne un asabhyon kaa aanshik rup se sabhy banaaya
 Thus the Church or Institute of Christianity continued to dominate Europe's mind for at least a thousand years, with its full coverage
 yahan tak ki saadhaaran se saadhaaran aachaar athwa vichaar-kalpana par bhi isiyat kii chhap rakhti padati thi
 But the same church, which originally developed to fight against tyranny and oppression, now itself became the biggest bearer of oppression and autocracy
 pun: bible janata ko sankatmukt karne ke liye aage ai
 This in itself is a contradiction
 jab carch apni aseem shakti ke kaaran maanya ho gaya tha or padariyon ne cross ko vismrit kar diya tathaa mahanth log anuchit laabh uthaane lage the janata bedaav hokar pun: ishwari vachanon ko foundne lagi
 Originally written in Hebrew and Arabshek, it was 400 AD Was translated into Latin by St
 Jerome C
 and this authentic translation was used by the Roman Catholic Church
 kintu latin sarvasaamaanya logon kii bhashaa na thi, duusare isai dharmaguru bhashaaon yaa foohad boliyon main hue bible ke anuwaadon se bahut chidhate the
 This was not only because the Christian leaders wanted to maintain their position of privilege, although there was an abundance of it, they were afraid that their words would not lose the power and intent of the divine words by being translated into the colloquial language
 keval ek chirparichit muhaavara poojya bhav or bhakthi ko uttejit karanevaala atyuttam madhyam nahin he athwa anivaary rup se gahan satyon kaa sarvopari sampreshak nahin he
 Somehow, due to the misconduct of the church, a new conflict started in religion and religious institution
 is avadhi main, saath hi saath bumadhyasaagar ke purvi taton par ek nai shakti kaa udai ho rahaa tha or islam ke umadte jowar ke purv anek isai mataavlambee pashchim kii ore bad chadh aae the
 Although the actual renaissance came decades later, these scholars and worshipers of Christianity were its precursors
 unhone logon ko anirdisht uttejnaaon se bhar diya
 "lollard" was the first to raise his voice in England
 yah ek sampradaay tha jo janata main isa messiah ke upadeshon kii shiksha detaa tha or carch tathaa math ke vichaar kaa virodh karata tha
 Their leader, Vikliffe was a man of amazing courage and erudition
 usne anubhav kiya ki vichaarparivartan ke liye logon ko isa ke upadeshvachanon kii jaankaree aavashyak he
 For this, translation of the Bible into the public language became necessary
 is prakaar us kaal kii naveen chetana vicliff kii aawaaj main dhvanit hui
 Wikliffe occurred at a time when English prose had little power to express the full opulence and beauty of the Bible
 iskaa apana anuwaad bahut hi ruksh he
 Perhaps he had no ear for English-speaking music
 ibrani padya kii kuch apni nijee visheshtaon ke kaaran uske mul sanskaran main ek aisi bhavyata bhi thi or prayog se kahin adhik mahatv hebrewwali bible ke shabdasaundarya kaa tha jo kuch pracheen anuwaadon main sahaj hi kho gaya tha
 Nouns have a special place in syntax, and the imperative of divisions today was not even there at that time, because it was a great real fantasy that was the Jews' own and their sense of words was touching
 is prakaar kuch shabdon main hi samathrya or tivrata hoti thi kyonki ve shabd lagu na hokar beej rup main hote the
 Apart from this, the theme of ancient Dharmanium is widely accessible
 vishaywastu ke ruchikar hone or alp-samay-saadhy hone ke gunon ke kaaran isaki gaathaayen, varnan, natyagitiyaan bhavishyavaaniyan, sukhtiyaan, laghu kathaayen sabhi ne milakar ek savyav aakaar-prakaar dhaaran kar liya tha
 Finally, the New Testament contains the words of Jesus in the law
 at: unhen samajhane main thodi bhi chook athwa bhram ho jane par na keval uljhan hi bad jaati he balki sampurna aashay hi bhrasht ho jaataa he
 It is no wonder, therefore, that the churches did not consider the translations appropriate
 phir bhi wiliam tinden ne bible ke angreji anuwaad kaa pratham pramanik prayaas kiya
 He used the original Italian version which was prepared in Italy in the fifteenth century and also resorted to a Wikliffe translation made in the fourteenth century
 anuwaad ke liye usne saralatam angl shabdon ko chunaa or is prakaar jansadharan kii bhashaa se naikaty sthapit karte hue apana anuwaad prastut kiya 
 Tyndale also used Erasmus and the Zurich version of Luther and Zinggli
 phir bhi tindel kii sahajata kahin kahin atapate prayogon se sambhddha thi
 But it was only near Tyndale's Bible that Kaberdale was a great preacher
 vah tindel kii spashtataa ko nibaahane main safal hua he kintu usne use vaagmiyata se bhar diya he
 That is why he proves to be an extraordinary craftsman of prose
 kaverdell ke pashchaat san 1611 tak is disha main kai prayaas kiye gaye
 Seven years of tireless hard work produced the authentic version
 47 vidwaanon, vishpon ne lasalot andüju kii adhyakshata main, westminster ke do vishvavidhyalayon main, is kaary ko teen khandon main puraa kiya
 Scholars wisely left Tyndale's clarity and Coverdale's lyrical eloquence to a large extent
 unhone anya anuwaadon se bhi sahaayta lee or is prakaar apane pramanik anuwaad ko ek suvyavasthit saundarya tathaa sangitatmak swar maadhuri pradaan kii jiskaa angreji bhashaa main dubaara paaya janaa sambhav nahin he
 Not only did it fill the Hebrew with its innate beauty and elemental power intact, but in proper terms, it acquired a "pictorial" and lyrical quality that was the result of excellent English talent
 yah janata kii boli main ghulmil gaya he
 Scholars say that his 93 ऽ words are in English
 uskaa shabd kabhi bhi praapt yaa siikhaa hua nahin he tathaa anuwaad main gruhit shabd bilkul hi nahin he
 It was also necessary to clarify the intention as there should be no scope for rigor in the book, which is considered to be the book of God
 yadhyapi style bolchaal kii hi honi aavashyak thi taaki log samaj saken, tathaapi ganvaarupan ke liye bilkul hi sthaan na tha
 Then, it was also necessary to have simple words, and as such occasion beauty and restraint were also required
 pramanik anuwaad main in sabhi gunon kaa prachurya tha

 During one of his wrestling events, for the first time, his attention turned to "superstar" Billy Graham and he was inspired by him
 Hogan was also a skilled musician who spent ten years as a bass guitarist in various Florida-based rock bands
 In those days, many wrestling wrestlers in the Florida area used to come to the mines where Hogan would perform his music

 During matches in Japan, Hogan contrasted the wide repertoire of various Western moves, relying on the more technical, traditional tricks and tricks of wrestling, in contrast to his power-based fighting style, which American fans had grown accustomed to seeing
 Used
