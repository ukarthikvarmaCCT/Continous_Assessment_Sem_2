 Ghulam Qadir was the ruler of Ruhelkhand which is notorious for its tyrannical atrocities

 He had inherited his grandfather's conspiratorial talent, but his intelligence or foresight was not found at all

 Due to the addiction of alcohol, he began to be inattentive in his works
 uski mahattvakanksha shaasha banakar apane dada kaa anukaran karne kii thi
 Ghulam Qadir initially served Ahmed Shah Abdali from 1761 to 1770 AD and came to India after that
 jis samay mahadji scindia rajputon ke saath lalsot ke yuddh main sankatagrast sthiti main aa gayi the, or 30 july 1787 ko unke lagbhag 8 hajaar sainik vidroh karke shatruon se mil gayi the, us samay maraathon ke anek shatruon ne mahadji kii doordarshita ko na samaj paane ke kaaran vidroh kar diya tha
 Mahadji's position remained worrying for almost a year
 isi bich gulam kaadir ne maratha sena ko doaab ke durgon se khaded kar us samast pradesh par adhikaar kar liya, jo usase haal main chin liya gaya tha, or vah mahadji ke adhikaar ko chunauti dene ke liye sidhaa dilli aa gaya
 On 5 September 1787, Ghulam Qadir took all the posts and powers over which Mahadji Shinde had commanded him, appearing before the helpless Emperor Shah Alam in Delhi and threatening to punish him
 ismail beg tathaa gulam kaadir ne paraspar sahyog purvak dilli tathaa sameepvarti pradesh par apana shashan sthapit kar liya
 Emperor Shah Alam was frightened by Ghulam Qadir to such an extent that he could not even accept Mahadji's offer to come to the remote Maratha camp via Ambuji Ingale
 jab mahadji apni raksha-yojanaon main vyast the tabhi pathaanon ne gulam kaadir ke netritv main rajputon ke sahyog se panipat se pehle kaa apana purana khel punah aarambh kar diya tha
 He invited the Shah of Kabul to drive out the Marathas from North India
 is samay ahmedshah abdali kaa putr taimur shah afgaanon kaa shaasha tha
 But due to Mahaji's long-term plans to establish friendship with the Sikhs, Timur Shah was not ready to cross the Indus, taking the risk of rebellion by the Sikhs
 1788 ke pratham teen maheenon main apane aviral praytn se mahadji ne apni sthiti main sudhaar aarambh kar diya tha
 His ally Rane Khan defeated Ismail Beg and three generals entered Doab chasing Ghulam Qadir
 22 april ko chaksan ke sameep bhayanak parantu or anirnaayak yuddh hua
 The slave fled to Qadir to protect his princely state
 1 july 1788 ko ismail beg apni samast mughaliya sena sahit dilli ke sameep yamuna ke duusare tat par sthit shahdara main gulam kaadir ke saath ho gaya
 There it was decided to take possession of the treasury and the king's lands
 jite jane vaale samast dhan main se do bhaag gulam kaadir kaa or ek bhaag ismail beg kaa kiye jane kaa nishchay hua
 Ghulam Qadir, along with his army, crossed the river at 'bari Ghat' on 14 July and took over the city on 18 July
 mohammadshah kii do vriddha beghamon -- malikaa jamaani tathaa sahiba mahal nen uske dushkrityon main uskaa saath diya
 These two Begums gave Ghulam Qadir Rs 12 lakh in cash to remove Shah Alam from the state and to seat his grandson Bedar Bakht
 24 july ko shah alam gulam kaadir kii samast maangon ko sweekaar karne ke liye vivash kiye gayi
 The emperor kept his son Suleiman Shikoh as a body-hostage to obey the promise
 30 july ko gulam kaadir or ismail beg ne laal kila tathaa rajbhavan par adhikaar karke shah alam ko ek choti si masjid main band kar diya tathaa rajkosh evam haath lagane vaali moolyawaan vastuon ko lootnaa aarambh kar diya
 The scandal continued for 68 days thereafter until he was removed from the Raj Bhavan
 31 july 1788 ko gulam kaadir ne shah alam ko padchyut karke purv samraat ahmedshah ke putr bedaar bakht ko 'nasiruddin mohammad jahaan shah' kii oopaadhi dekar gaddi par baitha diya
 Thus he followed the promise made to Malika Jamani
 iske baad gulam kaadir ne rajvansh kaa sab prakaar se apmaan kiya tathaa bheeshan ksht diye
 Finally, on August 10, he also broke Shah Alam's eyes
 nanhe-nanhe bacchon tathaa asahaay striyon ko kai-kai dinon tak ann-jal tak nahin diya gaya or is prakaar unako bhookha maar diya gaya
 The princes were beaten with cane
 rajkumariyon ke saath balaatkaar kiya gaya or naukaron ko tab tak peeta gaya jab tak ki ve mar na gayi
 To find out the secret money, the entire area of raj Bhavan and all the buildings of rich people in the city were dug up

 In the context of the above events, Firdaus Anwar has accepted that: dow0 aashirvadilal shrivastav ne gulam kaadir ke ukt atyaacharon ke sandarbh main likhaa he ki : Mansoor Ali Nazir advised and supported him in the atrocities of Ghulam Qadir
 lekin dhan kii havas main gulam kaadir ne use bhi nahin choda tathaa usase saat lakh rupay vasuulne chaahe
 He was beaten fiercely on 23 September for his refusal
 is prakaar ruhelon ne akut dhan lutaa
 Ismail Baig supported Ghulam Qadir in commanding Delhi and accepting money, but he was totally against the tyranny of the emperor and his family
 aapas main matbhed hone par gulam kaadir ne sara dhan akele hathiyaa liya
 So at the end of September, when Mahadji began to reclaim his power, Ismail Beg turned to Mahadji circumstantially and tried hard to drive out the slave Qadir from Delhi
 laal kile ke andar rajmahal main jo vibhats drishy upasthit kiye ja rahe the, unki kuch samay tak koi soochna baahar ke logon ko nahin mil paayi
 When Mahadji received some obscure news in September, he immediately organized a campaign for assistance
 unhone ek badi shakti ke saath rane khan ko bheja
 Soon Jeevaba Dada also traveled
 maraathon ne 28 sitambar ko puraani dilli tathaa 2 oktober ko mukhya nagar par adhikaar kar liya
 Ismail Beg and Begum Samru supported Rane Khan and started firing cannons at the fort
 paraajay ke dar se gulam kaadir lut kaa maal yamunapar bhejne laga taaki vah uske dhausgarh sthit ghar main surakshit rakhaa ja sake
 On 10 October, due to the negligence of the soldiers of Ruhele, there was an explosion in eating the gunpowder of the fort
 iske baad shesh sipaahiyon tathaa lut ke maal ko lekar gulam kaadir ne lalakile ko khaali kar diya
 The next day on October 11, Rane Khan, Himmat Bahadur Gosain and Ranaji Shinde entered the citadel
 unhone bhukhe nivaasiyon ko bhojan diya tathaa mahal main rahane waalon ke liye yathashakti shanti tathaa suvidha pahunchaane kaa praytn kiya
 On 16 October, Rane Khan appeared before the blind emperor and placed him on the throne and taught him the title again
 gulam kaadir ko pakadaney kaa prabal praytn kiya gaya; haalaanki dilli tathaa aasapaas kii vyavastha sanbhaalane ke kaaran isamen kuch samay laga
 Running from Doab, Ghulam Qadir reached Meerut on 4 November, and took refuge in the stronghold there, and courageously resisted the Maratha invasion for 6 weeks
 ant main 17 disambar ko use bhaagna padaa tathaa shamali ke 3 mile dakshin-pashchim bamnauli main ek brahman ke ghar apane kuch anucharon sahit vah chhip gaya
 Two of Ghulam Qadir's companions Mansoor Ali Khan Nazir and his organ guard commander Manihar Singh were arrested in Meerut
 gulam kaadir ko pakadaney main rane khan kaa saath vishesh rup se aleebahadur de rahaa tha
 Alibhadur got the address of Ghulam Qadir from that Brahmin and captured him on 19 December and along with other prisoners took him to Mahadji's camp at Mathura on 31 December 1788
 do maheene tak mahadji praytn karte rahe ki bandiyon se balpurvak yathasambhav dhan tathaa jaankaree praapt kar len
 Emperor Shah Alam also removed the eyes of Ghulam Qadir, removing the possibility of any kind of leniency in the punishment given by Mahadji
 4 march 1789 ko use prandand de diya gaya or uski laash ko jansadharan ke samaksh pradarshit karne ke liye dilli bhej diya gaya
 It is said that his headless corpse was hung from a tree there

 yah ghoshit kiya gaya tha ki sho main avika gore ko mukhya nayika ke rup main darshaya jayega or palak jain ko unki bahan jahnavi ke rup main dikhaaya jayega
 It was also announced that Meghna Malik's role in the show would be positive and that Ammaji would be different in mind, body and appearance in this version of Lado

 Naa Aana was related to serious topics like trafficking and sexual exploitation of the masculine women of Lado - Veerapur, the sequel of this Desh Lado chote parde ke saphaltam dharawahikon main se ek naa aana is desh lado kaa doosraa sizan tha lado 2 / lado - virpur kii mardaani
 The show returned eight years later with its second season
 jahaan pehle sizan main yah sho kanya bhrun hatya par aadhaarit tha, is baar kahani main mahilaon kii kareed-farokht or unke shoshan jaise gambhir muddon ko uthaaya gaya tha
 Talking about the story, the masculine thinking was still dominant in Veerpur
 vahaan balavant singh kii hukumat chalati thi, jo ladakiyon kaa apharan kar unhen bech detaa tha
 No girl was safe in Veerpur
 haryana ke ilaakon main sthit, sho 6 navambar 2017 ko waapas aa gaya tha or isi tarah sakht or kathor ammaji bhi waapas laut ain thim, jo samay ke saath naram ho gayi thim
 The show began with a 70-year-old man who enters Balwant Singh's mansion, who comes to deliver a bag full of money in exchange for a young bride
 balavant yuva ladakiyon kaa apharan kar unhen baari laabh ke liye bech detaa tha
 The show took a leap after the end of the first season's story and many things had changed in Ammaji's Veerpur, now ruled by Balwant Singh, whose terror spread throughout the village
 jabaki naa aana is desh lado main mahila bhrun hatya or sree jati se dwesh prachlit tha, haalaanki lado 2 main virpur main sthiti or kharaab ho gai thi, kyonki gaanv main shaayad hi koi aisi ladkiyaan thim jinke upar atyaachaar nahin hua tha, jisase yuva ladakiyon kaa apharan or mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh main vruddhi hui thi
 Ammaji, who had now gone to Delhi with her two ships, wanted to keep them away from Veerpur simply because Veerpur was not safe for young girls
 avika gore, jo ammaji kii badi potee anoushka kaa kirdaar nibhaati thim, ek swatantra or nidar vyakti thim
 While Anushka was fearless and ready to fight for what was right, her younger sister Jahnavi was a homely girl and the exact opposite of Anushka
 dilli main paidaa hui, anoushka ko unke jivan kaa sadame tab mila jab virpur main unki bahan jahnavi kaa apharan kar liya gaya, jo unke purvajon kaa gaanv bhi tha
 Meghna Malik, who reprized the role of Ammaji in Na Na Aana Is Desh Lado, was a flawless performance because of her flawless performance
 avika, jise hamane balika vadhoo or sasural simer kaa main dekha tha, ne is sho main majboot kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 As Anushka, we saw her in a new avatar and got excited
 virpur kii sthiti hamen kuch had tak 2003 kii film mathrubhumi kii yaad dilaati thi, jisamen pichley kuch varshon main mahila bhrunahatya kaa bhavishya chitrit kiya gaya tha
 The show was concerned with relevant issues, as human trafficking is on the rise and gender imbalance in the states of Haryana and Rajasthan has led to many criminal activities in these areas
 dharawahik kii kahani main uthaae gaye mudde or usase judi bhayavahata ko ham kai filmon or krime besd shos main dekh chuke the
 This cannot be denied, but the issue is timely
 kai rajyon main ladke-ladakiyon kii sankhya main antar ne ladakiyon ke prati aparaadh kii ghatnaon ko badhaava diya he isliye aise muddon ko jitna hilite kiya jaae acha he
 The story was not pulled in the initial episodes of the show, but only after a few episodes had the show moved back to its original story
 har episod main kuch na kuch hota rahaa, jisase sho darshakon ko anges karne main kaamayaab rahaa
 Talking about acting, Meghna Malik was once again able to impress with her character, although this time her role in the show was not that of a eater but a protector
 unako abhinay karte dekhnaa is baar bhi kisi treet se kam nahin tha
 Avika's intense style was special
 unhone apni pratibha ke saath ek baar phir nyaay kiya tha
 Palak Jain also did not disappoint with her role
 rituraj balavant singh ke kirdaar main nafrat jagaane main kaamayaab hue the
 The rest of the characters had taken the story well with their performances
 dharawahik haryana, dilli or chandigarh ke balldrop par tha
 This was done very well by the artists in dialogue delivery
 sho ke luk main bhi is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa gaya tha
 Overall, Lado - Veerapur's Mardaani was different from TV shows and lived up to the expectations due to its concept and powerful performance

 lekin yah koi saamaanya prem nahin tha
 It was love based on devotion
 chandar sudhaa kaa devtaa tha or sudhaa ne hameshaa ek bhakt kii tarah hi use sammaan diya tha
 Chander is in love with Sudha, but his ideals dominate Sudha's father's favor and personality, weaving something that he can never tell his mind to Sudha even if he wants to
 sudhaa kii najaron main vah devtaa bane rahanaa chahta he or hota bhi yahi he
 His association with Sudha is the same as that of a deity and a devotee

 Home science is the mode of education under which culinary science, nutrition, home economics, consumer science, children's upbringing, human development, interior decoration, clothing and apparel, house building etc
 are studied
 aitihaasik rup se jab baalkon ko krishi yaa 'shop' aadi kii shiksha di jane lagi to balikaon ke liye is vishay ke shikshan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gayi
 As the name itself suggests, home science is related to home i
e
 home
 aam taur par log samajhate hai ki grih vigyaan ghar kii dekhbhaal or gharelu saamaan kii saaj-sambhaal kaa vishay he
 But their understanding of this is only partially true
 grih vigyaan kaa kshetra kaaphi vist t or vividhta bharaa he
 Its scope goes far beyond the 'home' limit and it is not limited to just cooking, washing clothes, stitching or embroidery etc
 vastav main keval yahi ek aisa vishay he jo yuva vidhyaarthiyon ko unke jivan ke do mahatvapurn lakshyon ke liye taiyaar karata he - ghar tathaa parivaar kii dekhbhaal or apane jivan main carrier athwa peshey ke liye taiyaari
 Nowadays, both men and women play equally the responsibilities of home and family and also participate equally in the preparation of better use of available resources to make their lives happier
 grih vigyaan athwa ghar ke vigyaan kaa sambandh aap se, aapke ghar se, aapke parivaar ke sadasyon se tathaa aapke sansadhano se judi sabhi chizon se he
 Its purpose is - to provide you and your family members full satisfaction by effective and scientific use of your resources
 grih vigyaan kaa arth he, aapke sansadhano ke prabhaavshaalee prabandhan kii kala tathaa ek aisa vigyaan, jo ek ghar ko swasth tathaa sanand banaae rakhane or aavashyaktaa padane par ek safal peshey ke chunaav main aapaki madad kare
 Home science teaches you the art of using things, which helps to create an overall order, beauty, and intelligent environment around
 iske saath hi yah ghar kii dekhbhaal se sambandhit vaigyanik jaankariyaan bhi pradaan karata he
 We can understand this easily by an example - Home Science provides information about the nutrients required for the body and also tells about their functions
 yah ek ’vigyaan’ he
 And when you serve food rich in these essential nutrients to your family, it is an 'art'
 vigyaan or kala kaa yah samanvay aapke jivan ke har kshetra main kaam aata he
 Some of them are as follows - grih vigyaan ke vividh kshetron kii padhai karne ke baad aap apane sansadhano kaa behatar prabandhan kar sakate hai
 If you encounter any kind of problem while doing so, home science will give you the right directions to solve it
 aisa karke aap ek prabhaavshaalee vyakti banate hai
 You can use this knowledge in the development of your home and life
 aap or aapke parivaar ke sadsy apni dakshataon ke upyog se apni aarthik sthiti main sudhaar laakar zyada santushti kaa anubhav kar sakate hai
 When you will be able to meet the needs of your family, only then they will also be able to fulfill the responsibilities of both the house and outside
 samay, urja, dakshata aadi kuch anya sansaadhan hai, jo prabandhan main sahaayak hote hai or isamen grih vigyaan aapaki bahut madad karata he
 Nowadays most of the women are working, who either go out of the house to work, or they run their own employment by staying at home
 iske falswaroop ghar kii jimmedaariyon main purushon kii sahabhaagita bhi badi he
 Since in our society traditionally men are not very active in the work of dhar, they experience a lot of difficulty in getting into this system
 aise main unhen ghar kii vibhinn pakshon ke bare main jaanane tathaa ghar ko sundar banane tathaa sahi tareeke se chalaane kaa hunar seekhney kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Home Science is the only subject which provides the necessary rehearsal and necessary information to the youth to become a successful householder, a responsible citizen and a good parent
 haalanki grih vigyaan shiksha ke kaaphi vist t kshetra main kaary kar rahaa he, kintu aaj bhi is vishay ko lekar aam aadmi ke man main bhram kii sthiti bani hui he
 And this confusion remains only because people think that home science is not able to give all the respect and status they want to achieve
 bhranti - grih vigyaan keval khaanaa pakaane, kapade dhone or silaai-kadhai ke kaamon tak simit he- aam logon kii dharna he ki isamen sirf yahi sab baaten padhai-sikhaai jaati he
 Therefore, parents of young girls easily get ready to teach them this subject
 ve sochate hai ki yah unhen baad ke jivan main jimmedaariyon kaa nirvaah karne main sahaayak siddh hoga
 The truth - cooking, washing and keeping clothes, and embroidery-weaving is a very small part taught under home science
 darasal iske dwaara ham apane jivan se judi sabhi aadharbhoot baaten sikhte hai- ki hamaara sharir kaise kaary karata he, ki hamen swasth rahane ke liye kis prakaar ke aahaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, ki apni tathaa vaataavaran kii swatchta ke liye kin niyamon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak hota he, ki hamen bimariyon se bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie tathaa jab ham tathaa hamaare athmiya jan biimaar hon, to kis prakaar kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie aadi
 In this, we learn about the choice of clothes to be used in various household functions
 bachche hamaare jivan kaa ek abhinn angrihain
 We all want their safe and proper development
 is paathyakram main ham sikhte hai ki janm ke purv or baad bacchon kaa vikaas kis prakaar hota he or ek achche tathaa jimmedaar naagarik ke rup main unke vikaas main ham kya bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Apart from this, we also learn to manage our resources like time, energy and money, so that we experience more satisfaction with their maximum use
 bhranti- grih vigyaan kaa sambandh keval ladakiyon se he - bahut se log yah samajhate hai ki grih vigyaan keval ghar se sambandhit kaaryon kii shiksha detaa he, isliye ise keval ladakiyon ko hi padhanaa chahie
 Truth- Today both women and men share the responsibilities of the household equally, because today the structure of our society has changed a lot
 aaj sanyukt parivaar tut kar ekal pariwaron main badalane lage hai
 In such a situation, the responsibilities of the house have to be handled by the husband and wife themselves
 adhikansh mahilaayein ghar se baahar kaam par jane lagi hai, isliye purushon ko ghar kii jimmedaariyon ke bare main adhik se adhik shiksha kii jarurat badi he
 And the preparation or rehearsal of all these things can only be found in home science as a subject
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj anek yuva purush is vishay ko padhane kii taraf unmukh hue hai
 Misconception - It can be learned from your mother / grandmother too - People think that the things taught in home science are so easy that they can be easily learned from their mother / grandmother in the home
 iske liye ek vishay ke rup main grih vigyaan kii padhai karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Truth- It is true that girls learn a lot from home by watching their mother or grandmother working, but that is not enough
 bahut se kaam aise hai, jo paramparaagat rup main gharon main chalate chale aa rahe hai, lekin logon ko unka vaigyanik aadhaar nahin pataa he
 Take pickle for example
 sabhi jaanate hai ki achaar ko tel kii parat se dhaknaa padataa he, lekin jab aap unase puuchhenge ki aisa kyon kiya jaataa he, to aapaki maa ise nahin samajha paaengi
 But when you study home science, it will tell you that oil prevents the pickle elements from getting spoiled by the wind
 isi prakaar ke anek udhaaharan har kisi ke jivan main mil jaaenge
 It is important to note that if we know about what we are doing and why we are doing it then it becomes easier
 bhranti - grih vigyaan kii padhai carrier nimarn main sahaayak nahin he - zyaadaatar logon kaa yah bhi sochna he ki grih vigyaan chunki ghar ke bheetar kiye jane vaale kaaryon ke bare main shiksha detaa he, isliye carrier kii da shti se yah anupayogi he
 If a youth wants to earn a living, he should read a 'serious' subject
 sachai - grih vigyaan yuva ladke tathaa ladakiyon donon ke liye rojgaar ke anek avasar ulabdh karaata he
 Studying as a subject of home science in school can provide a lot of employment opportunities
 lekin iske liye aavashyak he ki anya vishyon kii tarah hi is vishay kii bhi aage tak padhai jari rakhen or kisi ek vishesh kshetra main visheshgyata praapt karen
 Some of the common employment opportunities arising by studying home science as a dietician in hospitals, as a fashion designer in a boutique, as a hostess / hostess or receptionist in hotels, as a teacher / teacher in schools / colleges, etc
 Huh
 grih vigyaan kii padhai ke baad aap kaaphi acchhee aay vaali or santoshjanak naukariyaan praapt kar sakate hai
 There are mainly five parts to home science
 ye nimnlikhit hai- Today, this science has developed so much that each of its organs has developed its own sub-divisions
 ye up-vibhaag nimnlikhit hai- The curriculum designed to make Indian women skilled modern housewives is called home science
 ise america main prachlit gharelu arthshaastra or britain main prachlit gharelu vigyaan kii shikshan saamagree ke mail-jol se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 In this course subjects such as domestic economics, hard-borne-silai, child-rearing, moral education and arrangement and hygiene in home affairs are included
 grih-vigyaan ke aalochak ise striyon ko parichit or simit gharelu bhoomika main baandhe rakhane, pitrusatta kaayam rakhane or striyon ko raajnneetik rup se niskriy banaaye rakhane kaa shadyantra maanate hai
 On the other hand, home science is also considered to be the bearer of modernism and nationalism to an early extent within the realm of the Indian home
 apane samay main anek nariwadi sanghathanon ne bharat main grih-vigyaan ko stri-adhikaron ke saath jod kar dekha he
 In this discourse, the house is uniquely considered a feminist entity
 yah vimarsh maanata he ki grih-vigyaan dwaara striyon ko naveenatam vaigyanik takneekon or aadhuniktam jaankaree dwaara parivaar-nirmaan kaa adhikaar miltaa he
 In this way, home science emerges as a component of the definition of the domestic aspect of modernity at the center of which a trained woman is entrusted with the physical, mental and moral development of the entire family
 aupniveshik kaal main stri-samanta or adhikaron ke liye sangharsh bhi chal rahaa tha or uske saath hi pitrusattatmak vyavastha banaaye rakhane ke liye dharm, parampara or sthapit saamaajik vyavastha kaa hawala dekar strion ko haashiye par banaaye rakhane kii muhim bhi jari thi
 In the midst of this struggle, efforts were made to connect women with modern education, but there were huge obstacles in educating them like men
 isi dauraan bhartiya striyon ko unke parivesh ke anuroop hi shikshit karne ke liye grih-vigyaan kaa pruthak adhyayan kshetra banaaya gaya
 Home science also included the ideal of making women a better housewife and developing as an educated citizen
 british prashasan ne bhi is kshetra main pahal lee
 a program was started to train women teachers for teaching of home science
 prashasan ne bhartiya samaaj- sudhaarkon ke saath mil kar sabase pehle vidhwaa striyon ko is prashikshan ke liye chunaa
 After training, these women could become financially independent
 prashasan vidhwaaon kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye aavashyak samaaj- sudhaar jaise kaaryakramon ko puraatanapanthi samaaj ke baari virodh ke kaaran sthagit karne kaa icchhuk bhi tha
 In the initial phase of training of women teachers, most of the women were from Christian community or non-brahmin society
 lekin ucch varna ke kuch pramukh bhartiya samaaj sudhaarkon ne apane parivaar kii striyon ko bhi is prashikshan main bhaag lene ke liye utsahit kiya
 Many new educational and training institutes were established to popularize the teaching of home science in European secondary schools
 grih-vigyaan ko vaigyanik drushtikon pradaan karne ke liye iske prashikshan ko praayogic evam vyaavhaarik banaate hue shikshan-saamagree main vigyaan ke buniyadi siddhanton kaa samavesh kiya gaya
 The credit for publicly campaigning for women's rights in India goes to Swarna Kumari Devi, the daughter of Devendra Nath Thakur, a pioneer leader of the Brahmo Samaj and sister of Rabindranath Thakur
 unhone 1882 main kalakatta main vidhwaaon or garib striyon ko aarthik rup se swazlambi banane ke liye prashikshan dene kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Similarly, Pandita Ramabai Saraswati had organized a program to train women for employment through Arya Stree Samaj and Sharda Sadan in Pune
 1910 main swarna kumari devi kii putree sarala devi choudharani ne keval striyon ke liye bharat stri mandal kii sthapana karke striyon ko unke ghar par hi shikshit karne kaa abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 European missionaries and Indian social reformers were at the forefront of providing education to women in the early twentieth century
 lekin adhiktar striyon kii shiksha anaupchaarik taur par unke ghar par nijee shikshakon ke dwaara di jaati thi
 In fact, most reformers wanted to relate women's education to their domestic obligations so that they could bring qualitative improvement in the upbringing and lifestyle of their family-family
 is prakaar kii shiksha ke liye grih-vigyaan ko sarvottam vishay mana gaya
 Home science was introduced as the bearer of the role of the ideal wife-mother-house Lakshmi to the women trained in home science to establish the ideal form of the concept of 'home' in Indian society
 grih-vigyaan ne bhartiya ‘ghar’ ko ek aisi prayogshaala bana diya jiske daayre main parivaar evam samaaj main vyapak sudhaaron ke abhiyaan kaa armbh ho saktaa tha
 Along with this, to make home science acceptable to the enlightened-minded Indians, it was presented as a medium which was effective in giving Indian women an honorable place in their own home and to center women in comprehensive social reform
 Could play grih-vigyaan kaa vichaar upniveshwaad-virdohi andolan main prachaarit kii ja rahi adarsh stri-chhavi ke anukool bhi baithta tha
 After Gandhi took over the leadership of the movement, ordinary Indian women also started taking part in it in large numbers
 gandhi ne striyon ko jodne ke liye maan-patni-bahan kii adarsh niyaswaarth chhavi kaa dohan kiya
 Similarly in the Hindu nationalist interpretation, Bharat Bhumi was represented as Bharat Mata
 tamilnadu main bhi tamil bhashaa ke andolan main tamil bhashaa va tamil rashtriyata ko maan ke rup main darshaya gaya
 The revival of Tamil asmita and the propaganda of Tamil pride as a motherly figure promoted women as house owners and maternal powers
 parinamswaroop na keval atmasamman andolan main striyon ne badi sankhya main hissaa liya, balki tamilnadu ke saamaanya logon main bhi stri-shiksha ke prati jaagrukta viksit hui
 The top leadership of the Tamil movement also advocated such reforms for women to make the role of wife and mother effective
 grih-vigyaan ke bhartiyakaran or iske prasar main kuch bhartiya striyon ne pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Parvati Bai Athawale, belonging to Dhondo Keshav Karve's widow ashram, went on a trip to America in 1918 where she saw how the use of scientific methods in domestic work could be of great benefit to India as well
 isi prakaar baroda ke pradhanmantri kii putree hansaa mehta ne bhi 1920-21 ke dauraan america main gharelu arthshaastra ke prashikshan kaa adhyayan kiya or waapas lautakar maharaj saiyaji raav vishvavidhyalay main ek stri mahavidhyalay kii sthapana kii jisamen grih-vigyaan paathyakram kaa praaroop american visheshgy ain gilcrist strang ne taiyaar kiya
 Strong's book 'domestic Science for High School in India', published in 1931, has long been considered the most standard text book of Indian home science
 bhartiya stri sanghathan ne bhi grih-vigyaan ke anaupchaarik prashikshan kaa kaarykram chalaaya or isse sambandhit jaankaree ke prasar ke liye ek patrika stridharm kaa prakaashan kiya
 In it, articles of Journal of Home Economics published from America were published
 tamilnadu ke madras shahar main anek devdasiyon ko samaaj main punervasit karne ke uddeshy se grih-vigyaan kaa prashikshan diya gaya taaki ve gharelu karmchaaree kii tarah kaam main lagaai ja saken
 In 1926, some members of the Indian Women's Organization considered women's education as their primary objective in place of political freedom and left the Indian Women's Organization and established the All India Women's Conference
 is naye samooh ne striyon ko grih-vigyaan main prashikshit karne ke liye 1932 main dilli main ladi irvin college kii sthapana kii

 razia sultan kii samadhi / kabr, Razia al-din, the royal name "jalolat ud-din Raziyo", commonly known as "razia Sultan" or "razia Sultana" in history, was the Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate
 razia ne 1236 se 1240 tak dilli sultanate par shashan kiya
 She was the daughter of Iltutmish

 Razia Sultana was the first female ruler of Muslim and Turkish history
 razia ko uske pita shams-ud-din iltutamish kii mrityu ke pashchaat dilli kaa sultan banaaya gaya
 Iltutmish was the first ruler who appointed a woman to succeed him
 
lekin, muslim varg ko iltutamish kaa kisi mahila ko vaaris bananaa naamanzur tha, isliye uski mrityu ke pashchaat uske chote bete raknuddin firoz shah ko rajsinghaasana par baithaaya gaya

 Muslims also did not like the intimate relationship that was developing with Razia and her mentor, jamaat-ud-din-yakut, a Habshi

 , But his underestimating the outcome of this relationship proved fatal for his state

 But the actual tomb has not been decided yet

 apni is dhun ke kaaran janata aapako ‘devanagaripracharanand‘ or ‘hindi kaa sucraat‘ tak kahati thi
 It is worth mentioning here that before the establishment of 'kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha', you played an important role in the history of hindi-prachar by editor and publication of Devanagari Preacher in 1892
 yahaan tak ki aapke is kaary main bihar ke shri ayodhyaprasad khatri ne bhi apana yogadan diya tha
 Pandit Gauridutt wrote so many books for the promotion and dissemination of Devanagari script and edited several journals, in his 1870s he wrote a novel called 'derani Jethani Ka Kahani'
 yahan yah bhi gyatavya he ki bharatendu babu harishchandr ne hindi gadhy-lekhan san 1873 main prarambh kiya tha
 This novel by Pandit Gauridutt was published in 1870
 isse purv hindi-gadhy main saiyad insha allaa khan kii ‘rani ketki kii kahani‘ naamak pustak hi thi
 This proves that the first Hindi novel is the story of 'devrani Jethani'
 yah bade durbhaagya kii baat he ki hindi ke itihaaskaaron ke agrani acharya ramachandra shukla tak ne isaki upeksha karke pandit shraddharam fillori kii ‘bhagyawati‘ lala shrinivasadas kii ‘pariksha guru‘ naamak pustakon ko apane ‘hindi sahitya kii itihaas‘ naamak granth main kramshah ‘hindi kaa pehla saamaajik upanyaas' or ‘angreji dhang kaa pehla hindi upanyaas‘ mana he
 It is also a remarkable fact in this regard that on the publication of this novel, the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh also presented a prize of 'hundred rupees'
 aapke dwaara anudit ‘girija‘ naamak ek or upanyaas bhi ullekhneey he
 Where Pandit Gauridutt ji was a good prose writer, his talent in the field of poetry was also amazing
 iskaa supusht pramaan aapke ‘devraani jethaani kii kahani‘ naamak upanyaas kii bhoomika ke ant main die gaye us padya se mil jaataa he jo aapane uttar pradesh ke tatkaaleen governor dwaara puraskaar praapt hone par likhaa thah This automatically proves that in both prose-writing and poetry-writing, the name of Pandit Gauridutt is the leading and exclusive
 yah prasannataa kii baat he ki hindi ke kuch viveki adhyetaon kaa dhyaan gauridatt ji kii is pratibha kii ore gaya he or yah bhram ab dhire-dhire dur hota ja rahaa he ki hindi kaa pratham upanyaas ‘bhagyawati' or 'pariksha guru‘ na hokar ‘devraani-jethaani kii kahani‘ hi he
 The novel was first published in 1870 in Leitho method in the 'ziya raidkhana' of Meerut and its copy is still preserved in the 'national Library Calcutta'
 is upanyaas kaa punarprakashan ab patna vishvavidhyalay ke praadhyaapak or ‘samiksha‘ naamak shodh-patrika ke sampadak dow gopal raay ne karke vastav main ek abhinandaneey kaary kiya he
