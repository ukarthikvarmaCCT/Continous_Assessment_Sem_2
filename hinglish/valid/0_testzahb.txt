 ek sameekshak ko, elice kii tippanee American Psycho, created in Manhattan and started on April Fool's Day 1989, is based on the life of nearly three years of the rich young investment banker Patrick Bateman
 kahani kii shuruyaat main 26 saal kaa betman apane dainik jivan kii gatividhiyon ke bare main bataata he, jo neuyork ke abhijaat varg ke bich uski dainik jindagi se lekar shaam ke samay hui htya main uske sanlipt hone par khatm hoti he
 Bateman, who belongs to a large family, graduated from St
 Paul's School, Harvard and then Harvard Business School
 vah ek wal street nivesh company main vaais president ke rup main kaary karata he or upree west said main ek mahange manahattan apartment main rahata he, jahaan vah 1980 ke dashak kii uppi samskruti ko apana letaa he
 Through the conscious flow of the story told in his own words, he tells of interactions with his peers in bars and cafes, in his office, and in night clubs
 pustak kii pehali tihaai main koi hinsa nahin he or friday nit kii ek kadi kii tarah ek saadhaaran si kahani he jisamen betman apane saathiyon ke saath alag-alag prakaar ke nitaklbon main jane ke bare main bataata he jahaan ve cocaine kaa seven karte hai, saath hi club janevaale saathiyon ke pahanaave kii aalochana karte hai, fishan vyapaar par salaah-mashvira karte hai or upyukt shishtachar ko lekar ek duusare se sawaal poochhate hai
 With the introduction of the second third of the book, Bateman begins to tell about his day-to-day activities, ranging from worldly things like committing horrific murders to renting videotapes and reserving space for dinner
 
 betman kii chetana kaa pravaah samay-samay par un adhyyon main aakar tut jaataa he jinamein betman 1980 ke dashak ke sangeetkaaron, visheshkar jenesis, hui levis or da news tathaa whitney haston ke kaaryon kii aalochana karte hue pathak ko sidhe taur par sambodhit karata he
 In addition to describing his everyday life, Bateman also talks about his "romantic" life
 uskaa evalin naam kii ek saathi uppi ke saath prem sambandh he, haalanki vah kisi ke liye koi gahari bhaavana nahin rakhata he; iske alaava, vah aksar aakarshak mahilaon ke saath yon sambandh banaata he, apane prati apni secretary kii bhaawanaaon kaa durupyog karata he or louis kairuthars ke aakarshan ko nazarandaaj karne kii koshish karata he, jo ek kareebi samalangik saathi he or uske prati apane prem kaa izhaar karata he
 Bateman also tells of his relationship with his estranged family, which includes his mother with whom he meets in a nursing home due to old age, and his daughter and a younger brother who leaves college midway
 jaise-jaise pustak kii kahani aage badhati he, apni hinsak pravritiyon par betman kaa niyantran khatm hota jaataa he
 The details of his murders become more and more painful and complex, ranging from stabbing, rape, mutilation, demonic instinct and necrophilia in order to torture
 ek vivekshil vyakti kaa uskaa mukhauta tab utar jaataa he jab aakasmik baatcheet main vah serial hatyaron ke bare main nayi-nayi kahaniyaan sunaata he or apane sahakarmiyon ke saamne apane hinsak krityon ko kabool karata he
 People react in such a way as if Bateman is joking with them and does not want to hear anything about it, or otherwise misunderstand it completely
 At the end of the book, Bateman recounts some bizarre incidents such as watching an interview of a cheerio on a talk show, being chased by an anthropomorphic park bench, and ordering a stray cat to feed him through an ATM 
 Bateman's mental state appears to become more and more suspicious and the events described in the novel question whether he actually committed any of the murder incidents reported by him
 upanyaas ke ant main vah ek apartment main jaataa he jahaan usne vikrut kiye gaye mrit shariron ko ikaitha kiya he; betman ke aashcharya kii koi seemaa nahin rahati jab vah ek bilkul saaf-suthere, susajjit apartment main pravesh karata he jahaan sadati hui laashon kaa koi ata-pataa nahin he, lekin kai tej sugandh vaale phool hai, sambhawatah jinhen durgandh ko chhipaane ke liye rakhaa gaya tha
 He meets a real estate agent who is showing the apartment to potential buyers
 estate agent usase poochta he ki kya usne da neuyork times ke vigyaapan ko dekha he
 When Bateman pretends that he has seen, the real estate agent says that there is no such advertisement and asks him to leave without causing any trouble
 bet main apane vakil herold carnes se miltaa he jisaki ancering mashin par vah apane sabhi aparaadhon ko pehle hi kabool kar chukaa he; carnes, jo betman ko galati se koi or vyakti samaj letaa he, ise ek acha majaak samajhakar khush hota he
 Carnes scolds Bateman for all his crimes and further states that Bateman is a highly timid person and cannot commit such acts
 betman dwaara paul oven ke laapata hone par chunauti die jane ke baad carnes apratyaashit rup se daawa karata he ki usne kuch hi din pehle landan main paul oven ke saath dinar kiya tha
 This ambiguity is further compounded by repeated repetitions of this mistaken identity throughout the book
 paatro ko lagaataar duusare logon ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he, yaa un logon kii pahchaan par bahes kii jate he jinhen ve restaraaon yaa partiyon main dekh sakate hai
 Whether or not any of the crimes depicted in the novel actually took place, or whether they are confusing fantasies stemming from mental disorder, is deliberately left open
 pustak kii shuruaati panktiyon main timothy price ek chemical bank kii imaarat par bani graphity ko ghur rahaa he, jisapar likhaa he 'yahan pravesh karne vaale apni sabhi ummiido ko chhod den', jo dante kii divine kamedi main chitrit narak ke daravaajon kii ore ek ishaara he; pustak isi prakaar ke ek drishy ke saath khatm hoti he jahaan betman ek baar main baitha ek chihn ko ghur rahaa he jisapar likhaa he "yah koi chhutkaaraa nahin he"
 In the first appearance, Bateman exemplifies the image of a successful Manhattan manager; He belongs to a prominent family, well-educated, rich, popular among women, cultivated among cultural trends, has a fat-earning job and lives in a high-level, fashionable apartment complex
 betman ek parishkrut, budhimaan, vichaarsheel jawan aadmi ke rup main he, lekin vaastaviktaa main vah ek hinsak manorogi he jo logon par atyaachaar karata he or unki hatyaein karata he, apane peediton ke sharir ko vikrut kar detaa he or unki laashon ke saath yon sambandh banaata he
 Bateman uses his personal limousine to search for suitable victims on the streets
 betman jivan-style ke prati atyant samvedansheel he or fishan evam ucch stareey upabhokta vastuon ke prati visheshgyata kaa bhav dikhaata he
 In his story, he goes madly in detail about the things he and others have, especially his costume and even writing things like pens and pocket squares
 uske paas apane diziner, kharidne kii jagah or jin chizon ke bare main vah bataata he unki style par vishesh dhyaan dene kii aam pravriti he, jo aksar kapadon ke prakaar or rang ko nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 Bateman responds to the questions of his friends and co-workers very effectively, distinguishing between different types of mineral water, which tie is less heavy than Windsor Knot and wearing a waistband, pocket square and tie stripe Describes the appropriate method of
 aisa prathit hota he ki betman ko pyrs and pyrs main apni naukari kii katai aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Her father has another successful company, which is revealed during a conversation between Patrick and his ex-girlfriend when she asks why he would work in P&P

 into it
" Because he has no need to work, he occupies the highest position in his world; He usually arrives late at work - sometimes more than an hour late - and spends long lunches
 in sabhi phaaydon ke baavjood,betman ke prati uske saathiyon kii irshyaa puure upanyaas main jari rahati he
 In a scene where the characters involved compare business cards, Bateman is horrified when he discovers that his friend's card is better than it is because it contains a watermark
 sirf isiilie ki betman par sampatti or iske pratikon ko lekar ek junun savaar he, vah baatcheet main garib logon ke prati baar-baar nafrat ke bhav vyakt karata he
 American Psycho caused much controversy for Ellis's pictorial description of Bateman's murders
 kai log betman dwaara yon shoshan yaa yatnaa ke swarup ko shaamil karte hai, jinamein drishyon kaa varnan karne ke liye chitratmak bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Many murders involve various forms of mutilation including mutilation of the genitals
 upanyaas ke ek hisse main, betman jabardastee ek mahila kii yoni main ek tub daalata he or ek chuuhe ko uske andar chhod detaa he
 After pulling the tube out, he continues to cut it into two parts through a chainsaw
 elice betman dwaara apane kuch peediton kii htya karne ke baad uske aatanrik jananaangon kii jaanch karne ke saath-saath un drishyon main jahaan betman sharir ke angon ko pakaata he or khaataa he, unka vistrut vivaran bhi prastut karte hai
 At one point, Bateman states that he "tries to make the bread by removing the flesh from the girl's limbs, but it becomes very frustrating and instead i spend the afternoon after spreading his flesh around the walls, his body
" i spend my time chewing the pieces of skin and chewing them "
 Other details include the killing of a child at the New York City zoo by Bateman, as well as the killing of a dog

 Joseph was more interested in fighting and walking with his classmates than studying in the church
 jab georgia main nae prakaar ke juute banane lage to jozaf kaa pita tiflis chalaa gaya

 jab usee varsh lenin ko lakva maar gaya to satta ke liye trotski or stallin main sangharsh prarambh ho gaya
 After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin revealed himself to be his disciple
 chaar varsh ke sangharsh ke pashchaat trotski ko parajeet karke vah rus kaa netaa ban baitha
 In 1928, Stalin announced the first five-year plan
 is yojana ke teen mukhya uddeshy the - samuhik krishi, baari udyogon kii sthapana or nae shramik samaaj kaa nirmaan
 The government used to buy the grain produced in the collective farms at a fixed rate and used to rent tractors
 nirdhan or madhya varg ke krishakon ne is yojana kaa samarthan kiya
 The rich peasants opposed this but they were suppressed
 1940 i
 main 86% ann samuhik kheton main, 12 % sarkari formon main or keval 1 % vyaktigat kisaanon ke kheton main utpann hone laga
 Thus in about 12 years this revolutionary change in agriculture took place in Russia
 udyogon kaa vikaas karne ke liye turkistan main bijli kaa utpaadan badhaayaa gaya
 As a result of the new revolution, in 1937 only 10% of the people remained illiterate whereas before 1917 79% were illiterate
 stallin samyavaadee netaa hi na tha, vah rashtriya taanashaah bhi tha
 In 1936, 13 Russian leaders were accused of conspiring to kill Stalin and were sentenced to death
 is prakaar stallin ne apana maarg nishkantak kar liya
 By 1937, the trade union, Soviet and all the departments of the government were completely under him
 kala or sahitya ke vikaas par bhi stallin kaa purna niyantran tha

 1932 i
 main duusari panchavarshiya yojana lagu hui
 In this, emphasis was laid on the production of consumer goods
 faltah roosi janata ke rahan-sahan main sudhaar hone laga
 At the same time special attention was paid to the means of transport and construction of habitat
 chunki isi samay germany main hitler kaa udai hua tathaa usne rus par akraman kii niti apanaai
 Therefore, Stalin had to concentrate on the manufacture of weapons rather than the manufacture of consumer goods
 is kaal main rus main lohe-ispaat tathaa koyale kaa utpaadan kai guna bad gaya
 He became the leading country in the manufacture of tractors, rail engines
 yahi vajah he ki naaji akraman ke dauraan rus ne uskaa safaltaapurvak saamana kiya
 Similarly, it had to be postponed as World War II started in 1938
 stallin ne sabhi nijee kaaryon visheshkar krishakon ke formon kaa purna rup se unmoolan kar sarkari farm kholane kaa aadesh jari kiya
 He nationalized agriculture and created government and collective firms in place of individual fields
 samuhik formon kii sthapana bahut se kisaanon kii jameenon ko sammilit kar ek farm banaakar kiya gaya, jisamen samast kisaan samuhik rup se kaam kar saken
 All the small and big farmers opposed this grouping, but Stalin strictly faced them
 vidrohi kulkon evam krishakon ko lakhon kii sankhya main bandi banaaya gaya tathaa hajaaron ko goli se uda diya gaya
 Stalin stressed the end of illiteracy
 usne ek baar kaha tha ki bauddhik kranti ke bina samyavaadee aarthik vyavastha kii safalataa sambhav nahin he
 The government made primary education free and compulsory
 roosi bhashaa ke alaave anya bhashaa main bhi pustakon ko prakashit karne kii vyavastha kii gai

 Citizens were also given the right to get work
 is prakaar stallin ne rus ko pragati ke path par agrasarit kar dwitiya vishwayuddh main naaji germany kaa muqabla karne hetu taiyaar kiya
 It is true that he implemented policies through vigorous oppression, state of terror and dictatorship
 vah nirday hokar desh ke bhitari dushmano ke samaksh pesh hua
 But it is also true that if he did not do this, the only workers' government in the world would have been destroyed by the Nazis
