 Competent in leadership, students have highlighted special principles, situational contact, action, behavior, authority, philosophy and values, charisma and intelligence among others
 visheshta siddhant vyavhaar ke vibhinn prakaar or prabhaavshaalee vyaktitv se sambandhit pravritiyon kaa varnan karne kii koshish karata he
 This is perhaps the first academic theory of leadership
 thomas karlile, ko ham visheshta siddhant ke agradoot kah sakate hai
 Those who have gained authority by using their talents, skills and physical characteristics are described here
 ronaald hefetez ne unnisvin shatabdi kii parampara ko drushtipaat karte hue samaaj ke itihaas ko mahaan purushon ke itihaas se jodne kii koshish kii he
 Proponents of trait theory looked at leadership characteristics and stated that following certain characteristics could lead to effective leadership
 shele kirkpatrikk oredwin e loke ne visheshta siddhant ke udhaaharan die
 They argue that "the key leader includes a few more qualities: drive, leadership motivation;, honesty, integrity, confidence, cognitive ability, and business information
" unke shodh ke anusaar, "karishma, rachanaatmakataa or namyata ke liye kam spasht saboot he"
 Although there is an intuitive appeal to the attribution theory, many difficulties can arise in proving these theories and they challenge the opposition repeatedly
 visheshta siddhant ke sabase "majboot" sanskaran ke anusaar, "netritv visheshtaayen " sahaj hai or kuch log netritv visheshtaon se yukt hokar apni manovaigyanik visheshtaon se "janmatah netaa' hote hai
 By studying this theory we can tell that leadership measures leadership development as well as measuring leadership qualities, recognizing the difference between disabled leaders to competent leaders and then training competent people
 visheshta drushtikon kii aalochana ke jawaab main, siddhantkaron ne netritv ko vyavhaaron kaa ek samooh kaha he, 'safal netaaon' ke vyavhaar kaa anusandhan karte hue, unki vyavhaar kushalta or unke netritv kii vyapak style ko pahchaanana hai
 David Mankilland has seen leadership talent as a set of principles and not as a motivator
 He stated that successful leaders may require authority, low amounts of affiliation and high amounts of activity prohibition
 court levin, ronaald lipitt or ralf white ne 1939 main netritv style or netritv pradarshan ke prabhaav par thoda bahut kaam kiya tha
 The researchers evaluated their performance in a wide variety of work areas on a group of eleven-year-old boys
 prayek samooh main, netaa kaa prabhaav, unke nirnay, unki prashansa or aalochana, samooh kaaryon ke prabandhan main teen shaileyon ko dekha gaya he : sattavadi loktantric ahastkshep

 Leaders are not necessarily partnered in every task, but they often differ in work and generally provide personal praise and criticism for work
 loktantric kaary ko samuhik nirnay prakriya kah kar netaaon dwaara sahaayta pradaan kii gayi visheshta kaha gaya he
 Before finishing the work, the leader can benefit from the collective discussions, from the perspective of technical advice
 sadsy apni pasand ke anusaar samuhik rup se parishram-vibhaajan kaa faisla le sakate the
 In this situation, praise and criticism are objective and without any real action, the objective is met by any member
 ahastakshepavadita ne bina netaa ke bhagidaari ke sadasyon ko samuhik niti nirdhaaran main aazaadee de di he
 Leaders do not participate in the division of labor, they do not participate in the work until it is said and praise very little
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki loktantric style ko sabase zyada pasand kiya gaya
 Managerial grid sampling is also based on behavioral theory
 is namoonay ko robert blake or jine mauton ne 1964 main paanch alag netritv shaileyon ke suzav anusaar banaaya he, yah logon ke liye netaaon ke prati jo vyakulata he or lakshya prapti ke liye unki vyakulata he us ke aadhaar par banaai gayi thi
 Situational theory also appears as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership
 jaisaa ki karlil ne suzav diya, saamaajik vaigyanikon kaa tark tha ki itihaas mahaan purushon ke hastkshep ke parinaam se bhi adhik tha
 Herbert Spencer said that the person is a product of time
 yah siddhant bataati he ki vibhinn paristhitiyon main vibhinn visheshtaayen dikhaai deteen hai
 By this set of principles, no leader has an optimal psychological framework
 According to this theory, when a person actually behaves as a leader, one of his biggest reasons depends on the situation in which he functions
 Does
 " Some theorists began to analyze trait and situational approaches
 levin at al ke anusandhan ke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki shikshavidon ne netritv vidhaan ke varnanaatmak dhang ko saamaanya banane ko koshish kii, unhone unki teen netritv sheliyaan bataayin or kis sandarbh main ve kaise kaam karte he uski pahchaan bhi kii
 is sattavadi netritv style, ne udhaaharan ke liye, sankat ke samay to manjuuri di, par dainandin prabandhan main apane anuyaayiyon kaa man or dil nahin jeet paye
 loktantric netritv style ko aavashyak paristhiti main or adhik aam sahmati praapt he
 The laissez-faire principle is praised for the freedom it has received
 kyonki isamen netaa bhaag nahin letaa isiliye use deergh kaaleen or sangthanatmak samasyaon ke samay 'vifal' kaha jaataa he
 For this reason, theorists have called the leadership style circumstantially contingent and sometimes called the contingency principle
 aajkal chaar mukhya aakasmikta netritv siddhant dikhaai dete hai: feedler aakasmikta, varoom-yetton nirnay path-lakshya siddhant or hersey-balaanchard sthitijanya siddhant
 The leader's effectiveness is considered to be salient in this Feudler contingency model, which is why Fred Feidler called it the situational contingency theory
 This stems from leadership style and the result of situational friendly interactions
 yah siddhant hamen do prakaar ke netaaon ke bare main bataata he : ve jo logon ke saath achche sambandh viksit kar kaary puraa karte hai, or duusare ve jo kaary ko puraa karne ko hi apana mukhya kartavya samajhate he 
feedler ke anusaar, koi adarsh netaa nahin hai
 Both a work oriented leader and a relationship oriented leader can also be effective if their leadership is situational
 When there is a good leader-member relationship, a highly structured task and authority in the position of high leader, this position is considered a "favorable position"
 feedler kaa maananaa tha ki kaary unmukh netaa anukool or pratikul paristhitiyon main prabhavi hote he
 Whereas relationship oriented leaders perform best under intermediate circumstances
 victor varoom, ne philip yetton or baad main arthur jaago, ke sahyog se netritv sthitiyon, kaa varnan karne ke liye ek vargeekaran kiya
 This standard decision was used in the theory, where it relates to the factors of leadership style conditions and which describes which propositions are useful in which situations
 yah prastaav niraala tha kyonki yah prabandhak ke un vichaaron se sahamat tha jo vibhinn virgon, unke vichaaron or sthitiyon par nirbhar tha
 This principle was later called the Emergency Situation Principle
 path-lakshya siddhanthaka netritv robert house dwaara viksit kiya gaya
 This theory was based on Victor Wroom's Pratiksha theory
 or samarthan ye sabhi paryaavaran ke kaarak or anuyaayi visheshtaon ke liye praasangik hai
 In thisfeeder contingency theory, in contrast to the path-goal theory, four leadership behaviors are fluid, leaders can follow any principle of position and necessity
 path-lakshya siddhant kosaapeksh siddhant or vyaavhaarik netritv siddhant donon kahenge kyonki yah paristhitiyon par nirbhar karata he or netaa or anuyaayiyon ke bich paraspar vyavhaar par bal detaa he
 The situational leadership sample proposed by Hersey and Balanchard proposed four leadership styles and four follower-development levels
 prabhaavashiltaa ke liye, namoonay kii nischitata, netritv style anuyaayita-vikaas ko puri tarah mail khaanaa chahie
 In this sample, leadership behavior becomes not just the leader's traits but the characteristics of the followers
 ek vishesh or upyogi siddhant he, vishisht netaa vyavhaaron ko sambodhit karne ke liye upyogi he jo sanghathanaatmak yaa ikai prabhaavashiltaa main yogadan detaa he
 This theory argues that the leader's main job is to take care of whatever is needed for the group's need, so a leader has always done well for the effectiveness and unity of the group
 
 haalanki kaaryaatmak netritv siddhant sabase aksar dal netritv ke liye lagu kar diya gaya he, yah prabhavi dhang se vyapak sanghathanaatmak netritv ke rup main bhi acchhee tarah se lagu kiya gaya he
 Literature Summary on Functional Leadership, Zaccaro et al
, Huckmann and Walton, Morges, Klein, Jeigret, Knight, and Jeen noted that leaders perform five broad tasks in promoting the effectiveness of an organization
 in kaaryon main shaamil hai: paryaavaran nigaraanee, aadhinasth gatividhiyon kaa aayojan, adhinasthon kaa shikshan or prashikshan, dusron ko prerit karnaa or samooh kaaryon main sakriy rup se bhaag lenaa
 Various leadership behaviors expect these tasks to be carried out conveniently
 praarambhik kaam main netaa ne vyavhaar kii pahchaan, feishman, adhinsth karmchaariyon ke apane paryvekshakon ke vyavhaar ko do vyapak shreniyon ke sandarbh main vichaar karne ke liye or sanrachana kii shuruyaat ke rup main mana he
 It also includes promoting thought-making relationships
 is tarah ke vyavhaar ke udhaaharan ek adhinsth yaa dusron ke prati ek sahaayak tareeke se abhinay ke liye chintaa kaa pradarshan hota he
 The initial structure focuses on the leader's action and especially the work accomplishment
 isamen bhumika spashtikaran, pradarshan ke maanakon ko nirdhaarit karnaa or un maanakon ke prati javabdehi shaamil ho sakate hai
 The leader of the action has so much authority that he can perform certain tasks and reward or punish for the performance or non-performance of his party
 prabandhak ko yah avasar detaa he ki vah apane samooh kaa netritv kare or uskaa samooh uske netritv kaa paalan karne ko sahamat hota he taaki ek nirdhaarit lakshya puraa ho sake or uske badale main unako kuch mili
netaa ko adhikaar isliye diya jaataa he ki vah moolyankan kar sake, apane adhinsth karmchaariyon se sahi kaary karavaate hue unako prashikshan den, aise samay main jab ki utpaadakta vaanchit str se kam he or inaam prabhaavashiltaa parinaam milane par diya jaataa ho
 The conversion leader inspires his team to be effective and efficient
 lakshya praapt karne ke liye sanchaar hi aadhaar he jabatak samooh antim icchit parinaam yaa lakshya prapti nahin kar letaa
yah netaa zyaadaatar pratyaksh dikhaai detaa he or kaam karwaane ke liye adeshon kii shrinkhalaa kaa upyog karata he
 Conversion leaders focus on the big things, to care for the people who surround them
 netaa hameshaa upayon ke liye dekhte hai jo sanghathan kii sahaayta se company ke lakshya ko praapt kar sake
 Leadership is a process full of emotions in particular that carries the process of social influence with emotions
 
 ek sanghathan main, netaaon kii manodasha kaa samooh par kuch asar padataa he
 Three levels can be described in these effects: graahak seva ke shodh main yah paaya gaya ki netaa kii sakaaratmak manodasha samooh ke pradarshan ko behatar banaati he
 While in other areas another conclusion was found
 netaa kii manodasha ke alaava, uskaa vyavhaar anya karmchaariyon ke liye ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak bhaawanaaon kaa strot he
 The leader creates situations and events that evoke an emotional response
 uttejit ghatnaon ke samay kuch netaaon kaa apane karmchaariyon ke saath vyavhaar kaa pradarshan unheen prabhaavshaalee ghatnaon kaa parinaam hai
 Leaders shape workplace agitated events
 udhaaharan ke liye - pratikriya dete hai, kaary kaa aabtan karte hai, sansaadhan vitaran karte hai
 Because their emotional state has a direct impact on employee behavior and productivity, it is necessary to know the emotional state of organizational leaders
 bhavuk budhimatta, samajhane kii kshamta, apane or dusron kii manodasha or bhaawanaaon ko sambhaal lenaa sanghathanon main prabhavi netritv ko prabhaavshaalee banaata he
 Responsibility is leadership
 royapeta madhya chennai kaa ek kshetra he
 In a game of cricket, the wicket-keeper is the player in the fielding squad who stands behind the batsman currently behind the wicket or stumps
 kshetrarakshan karne vaale dal ke sadasyon main sirf wicket-keeper ko hi apane pairon main guard or dastaane pahanane kii anumati hoti he
 This is primarily a specialist role, although sometimes he is also asked to bowl, in which case another member of the fielding squad has to play the role of wicket-keeper for some time
 cricket ke niyamon main keeper kii bhoomika niyam 40 se niyantrit hoti he
 The main function of the keeper is to catch the balls that pass behind the wicket through the batsmen, but he can also try to dismiss the batsman in various ways: ek keeper kii sthiti gendbaaj par nirbhar karti he: tej gendbaaji ho rahi ho to vah stamps se thodi dur par khadaa hota he, jisase ki balle kaa kinaaraa lagakar aa rahi gend ko lapakane kaa use samay mil sake, jabaki dhimi gendbaaji ke vakt vah stamps ke kaaphi najadik pahunch jaataa he, jisase ki ballebaaj par yah dabaav rahe ki wo krij ke andar hi rahe yaa phir stump out hone kaa jokhim uthaae
 The more capable the keeper is, the more he will be able to catch fast bowling, for example, let us tell you that Godfrey Evans often kept wicket-keeping for Alec Bedser
 wicket-keeping ek visheshgy kaam he or iske liye usee tarah ke prashikshan kii jarurat hoti he jaise ki kisi visheshgy ballebaaj yaa gendbaaj se ummid kii jaati he
 However in today's time a wicket-keeper is expected to be a good batsman who can bat at least in the middle order
 jo wicket-keeper upar ke kram main ballebaaji main daksh hote hai unhen anaupchaarik rup se keeper / ballebaaj bhi kaha jaataa he
 There is only one keeper in a cricket team, so the selectors often face the challenge of choosing one of the two or more skilled keepers
 aksar aisa hota he ki do kiparon main se ek kaaphi behtareen keeper hota he, lekin vah sirf ek ausat ballebaaj hota he, jabaki doosraa keeper / ballebaaj hota he jo ballebaaji main to behatar he lekin vah apane pratidwandvi ke mukaable utana acha keeper nahin he
 The England selectors faced a similar selection dilemma in the 1990s when they were challenged to choose between Jack Russell and Alec Stewart
 ve in donon main se kisi ek ko lagaataar chunane main tab tak kabhi kaamyaab nahin hue jab tak ki 1998 main rasel sust padane lage: isse pehle tak donon kii bhoomikaayen badali jaati raheen, acchhee ballebaaji kii vajah se aksar stewart team main apni jagah banane main kaamyaab rahete the
 Similarly, Pakistani wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal is another example who is known as a wicket-keeper who squanders easy chances, but he has retained his place in the team for the past decade, as his batting from the alternative keeper Is it good
 aaj cricket main mahendra singh dhoni, kumaar sangakara, brandan makkulam or mark bouchar jaise behtareen keeper / ballebaaj hai
 The keeper may also have a captaincy role
 khaas baat ye hai ki vah kisi pari kii prayek gend main shaamil hote hai or ho saktaa he ki chizon ko vah jitani baariki se dekhne kii sthiti main hota he, utani captain nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 He can often be seen encouraging the bowlers and is also indulging in calling the batsmen "abusive" with accurate comments on his ability, personality and personal habits
 keeper hi ekmaatr kshetrarakshak he jise rakshaatmak upkaran se gend ko pakadaney kii ijaajat hoti he, jo ki aamtaur par ek bada gaddidaar dastaana hota he jisaki tarjani or anguuthe ke bich jaali lagi hoti he
 The protection that gloves provide is not always enough
 england ke keeper alan note atirikt suraksha ke liye kabhi-kabhi apane dastaane ke andar gaddi lagaaya karte the
 Wicket-keepers use leg pads to protect the legs and a box to protect the underside of the waist
 wicket-kiparon ko apane pad utarkar gendbaaji karne kaa mauka diya jaataa he or aisa tab aksar hota he jab koi match barabari kii ore bad rahaa ho yaa phir kshetrarakshan dal ek wicket lene ke liye betaab ho
 In first-class cricket, two wicket-keepers took off their pads and then took a hat-trick: in the 1954-55 match played in Cuttack, Orissa vs Bengal, in the match of Probir Sen and AC Smith in Warwickshire vs Essex in 1965 in Clacton
 In; Smith was a very unusual player, as he was primarily a wicket-keeper, but was sometimes selected as the lead bowler
 cricket ke niyamon ke niyam 2 ke mutabik ek sthanapann khilaadi wicket keeping nahin kar saktaa he
 This rule can sometimes be revoked with the consent of the captain of the batting squad, although Rule 2 does not allow any such consent
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1986 main lords main khele ja rahe england or newjiland ke bich test match kii pehali pari ke dauraan england ke visheshgy wicket-keeper bruce french chotil ho gaye the
 England then used four players as wicket-keepers in New Zealand's first innings: Bill Athey kept the keeper for the first two overs; Senior 45-year-old Bob Taylor was called and kept from the sponsors' tents and did a lot of erratic keeping from 3 to 76 overs; Hampshire keeper Bobby Parks was called for 77 to 140 overs; And then Bruce French kept wicket keeping till the last ball of the innings

 PC world magazine ne visicalc ko pratham electronic spredshit kaha
 Bricklin asked to see his university professor draw a table of calculation results on a blackboard
 When the professor found an error, he had to painstakingly rewrite the order, erasing several entries in the table that prompted Bricklin to think he could repeat the process on a computer, where the underlying formula had He can use the blackboard as a model to visualize the result

 visicalc became the first "killer app", an application that was so compelling, that people started buying specific computers to achieve it
 In this case the computer was Apple II and visicalc contributed significantly to the success of that machine
 Sent to early computers, specifically CP / m machines, the Atari 8-bit family, and various Commodore platforms
 Nevertheless, visicalc is more commonly known as "an Apple II program"

 Spreadsheet 2000 attempted to dramatically simplify formulation, but was generally not successful
 ek "khaane" ko ek box ke rup main mana ja saktaa he jisamen ek aankada hota he
 a single field is usually referred to by its column and row
 To change its shape according to the material, usually its length or width can be done by dragging the lines along the box
 khaanon kii vyuh rachana ko "shit" yaa "kaaryapatrak" kaha jaataa he
 In traditional computer programs, this corresponds to an array of variables
 In most experiments, multiple worksheets can be placed within a single spreadsheet
 ek kaaryapatrak, bas ek spredshit kaa upkhand he jise spashtataa ke liye vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Functionally, a spreadsheet operates in its entirety and all fields within the spreadsheet operate as global variables
 ek cell main ek maan yaa ek sutara ho saktaa he yaa ise bas khaali bhi chhod sakate hai
 According to the tradition, formulas usually begin with = sign
 ek maan ko computer keyboard se darj kiya ja saktaa he yaa sidhe ek khaane main tip kiya ja saktaa he
 Alternatively, a value may be based on a formula that can perform a calculation, show the current date or time, obtain an external data such as a stock quote or database value

 kuch aarambhik spredshits main dubaara gananaa ke liye hastchalit anurodh aavashyak tha, kyonki badi yaa jatil spredshit kii gananaa, aksar data pravishti gati ko kam kar detii thi
 Many modern spreadsheets still retain this option
 is suvidha ke liye ek cell kii saamagree ko samay-samay par adhyatan karnaa hota he, jab iske maan ko ek bahari strot se liya jaataa he - jaise ek anya "sudur" spredshit main ek khaanaa
 saajha or web-aadhaarit spredshit ke liye, yah "tatkaal" adhyatan khaane par lagu hota he jise kisi anya upyogkarta dwaara badla gaya he
 All dependent mines also have to be updated
 ek baar pravesh kar die jane ke baad, chaynit khaane ko aakasmik punarlekhan se bachaane ke liye vaikalpik rup se "band" kiya ja saktaa he
 This generally applies to mines that contain formulas, but may also apply to those containing "constants" such as a kilogram / pound conversion factor
 Despite the individual fields being marked off, spreadsheet data is not protected until this feature is activated in the file preferences
 ek khaane yaa shrenee ko vaikalpik rup se yah nirdisht karne ke liye paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he ki maan kaise pradarshit hoga
 difolt disple formet aamtaur par isaki aarambhik saamagree dwaara nirdhaarit hota he, yadi ise vishesh rup se pehle se nirdhaarit nahin kiya gaya he, isliye udhaaharan ke liye "31 / 12 / 2007" yaa "31 janvari 2007" ke liye khaane ke "taarikh" formet ke difolt hota he
 Similarly, adding a% signal after a numeric value will tag that field as a percentage cell format
 The contents of the field will not change with this format, only the displayed value will change
 khaane ke kuch formet jaise ki "sankhyatmak" yaa "mudra" bhi dashamalav sthaan kii sankhya ko nirdisht kar sakate hai
 " isse avaidh sanchaalan kii anumati mil sakati, jisase bina kisi uchit chetavanee ke visangat parinaam falit hote hai
 Depending on the capacity of the spreadsheet application, each cell can be formatted separately for which either the material can be used or the cell
 To increase the readability of a spreadsheet, cell formatting can be applied to conditional data - for example, a negative number can be displayed in red
 ek kaksh kaa swarupan aam taur par isaki saamagree ko prabhavit nahin karata or is baat par nirbhar karte hue ki kakshon ko anya kaaryapatrak yaa anuprayogon par kaise sandarbhit yaa copy kiya gaya he, swarupan ko saamagree ke saath kiya or nahin bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 In most experiments, a cell, or a group of cells in a column or row, can be "named" enabling the user to refer to that cell by name instead of a grid reference
 spredshit ke bheetar naam adwitiya hone chahie, lekin jab ek spredshit fil main kai shit kaa prayog ho to prayek shit par ek samaan namit kaksh shrenee kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he agar ise shit naam jod kar pahachaanaa jaataa he
 One reason for this experiment is the creation or operation of macros that replicate an order across multiple sheets
 ek anya kaaran yah he ki namit charon vaale sutron ko unke dwaara lagu kiye jane vaale bijganit ke khilaaf tatparta se jaancha jaataa he 
 namit charon or namit kriyaaon kaa prayog, spredshit sanrachana ko adhik paardarshee bhi banaata he
 In place of a named cell, an alternative approach is to use cell references
 Most cell references refer to another cell in the same spreadsheet, but a cell reference can refer to a different cell within the same spreadsheet, or to a cell entirely in another spreadsheet, or from a remote application
 To a value
 "A1" style main ek theth kaksh sandarbh, stambh kii pahchaan karne ke liye ek yaa do cese-sensitive aksharon se bana hota he jiske baad pankti kii sankhya aati he 
 donon main se koi bhi hissaa saapeksh ho saktaa he, yaa nirpeksh 
 vaikalpik "R1C1" sandarbh style r akshar, pankti sankhya, c akshar or stambh sankhya se bani hoti he; saapeksh pankti yaa stambh sankhya ko varg koshthak main sankhya ko gher kar ingit kiya jaataa he
 Most recent spreadsheets use the A1 style, with some providing the R1C1 style as a compatibility option
 jab computer ek kaksh main us kaksh ke pradarshit maan ko adhyatan karne ke liye koi sutara pariklit karata he to anya kaksh ko namit karne vaale us kaksh main kaksh sandarbh, computer ko namit kaksh ke maan ko laane ke liye prerit karte hai
 a cell in the same "sheet" is usually addressed as: - ek samaan spredshit ke ek alag shit par ek kaksh ko aamtaur par is rup main sambodhit kiya jaataa he: - Some spreadsheet implementations allow a cell reference in another spreadsheet on the same computer or on a local network
 It can refer to a cell in another open and active spreadsheet on the same computer or network that is defined as shareable
 in sandarbhon main puraa fil naam hota he, jaise: - In a spreadsheet, references to cells are automatically renewed when new rows or columns are inserted or deleted
 lekin ek pankti ko ek stambh yoga ke saamne jodate samay khaas saavdhaanee baratani chahie taaki yah sunishchit ho ki yoga main atirikt panktiyon kaa mulya pradarshit ho rahaa he - jo aksar nahin hota he! a circular reference occurs when a cell's formula contains a reference that directly or indirectly, through a series of references, each cell points to another cell that has a reference to the next cell on the chain
 - indicates a cell
 trutiyon ke kai aam prakaar is tarah ke vrittiya sandarbh ko prerit karte hai
 However, there are some valid techniques that are using such circular references
 aisi takneekein, spredshit kii kai punarganana ke baad un kakshon ke liye sahi mulyon par abhisaran karti hai
 Similarly, instead of using a named range of cells, a range reference can be used
 kakshon kii kisi shrenee ke liye sandarbh, farm ke liye aam he jo A6 ke madhyam se A1 shrenee main sabhi kakshon ko nirdisht karata he
 a formula like "= SUM" can join all the specified cells and place the result in the cell containing the formula itself
 aarambhik spredshit main, kaksh ek saral do aiami grid the
 Over time, the model also expanded to include a third dimension and in some cases a series of named grids, called sheets
 sabase unnat udhaaharan aavartan or vyutkram sanchalanon kii anumati data he jo data set ko vibhinn tareekon se chhaant kar prastut kar saktaa he
 a formula identifies the calculation that is needed to place the result in the cell in which it is contained
 ek sutara vaale kaksh ke pradarshan main isliye do ghatak hai; swayan vah sutara or parinamswaroop mulya
 vah sutara saamaanya rup se tabhi dikhaaya jaataa he jab us kaksh ko mouse dwaara "clic" karke ek vishesh kaksh ko chunaa jaataa he, anyathaa yah gananaa ke parinaam ko shaamil rakhata he
 a formula returns a value for a cell or series of cells, and is typically of the form: jahaan abhivyakti main shaamil hai: When a cell contains a formula, it often includes a reference to other cells
 is tarah kaa ek kaksh sandarbh char kaa ek prakaar he
 Its value is the value of the referenced cell or any derivative of it
 yadi vah kaksh badale main kisi anya kaksh ko sandarbhit karata he, to maan unke maan par nirbhar karata he
 The reference can be relative, absolute or mixed row-wise or column-wise absolute / relative
 maanya sutron ke liye uplabdh vikalp, vishesh spredshit karyanvayan par nirbhar karata he lekin, saamaanya rup main, adhikansh ankaganitiya sankriyaayein or kaaphi jatil nested sashart sankriyaayein, aaj kii adhikansh vanijyik spredshits dwaara nishpadit kii ja sakati hai
 Modern implementations also offer operations for accessing custom-built actions, remote data, and applications
 ek sutara main ek shart shaamil ho sakati he - vaastavik pariklan ke bina yaa saath main - or iskaa kabhi-kabhi puri tarah se istemaal trutiyon ko ujagar karne or pahchaan karne main hota he
 In the example below, it is assumed that the sum of the column of percentages is tested for validity and a clear message is inserted into the adjacent right-hand cell
 ek spredshit ko kisi sutara ko dhaaran karne kii zarurat nahin hoti or us maamle main use panktiyon or stambhon main vyavasthit mahaj data kaa ek sangrah mana jayega jaise ki ek, calendar, samay saarini, yaa saral suchi
 upyog main isaki aasaani, swarupan or hiserlinking kshamtaaon ke kaaran kai spredshits ko keval isi uddeshy ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Spreadsheets usually include many supplied functions, such as arithmetic operations trigonometry operations, statistical functions, and so on
 In addition there is often a provision for user-defined actions
 microsoft dhaksal main in kaaryon ko pradaan kiye gaye Visual Basic editor main Visual Basic ke prayog se paribhaashit kiya gaya he or aisi kriyaayein kaaryapatrak par swatah hi abhigam yogya hai
 Additionally, a program can be written that draws information from the worksheet, performs some calculations and reports the results back to the worksheet
 In the figure, the name sq is user-provided and the verb sq is introduced using the Visual Basic provided with Excel
 nem manager, namit char x or y kii spredshit paribhaashaon ko pradarshit karata he
 Verbs cannot write themselves to the worksheet, but only return their evaluation
 haalanki, microsoft dhaksal main, sabaroutine, sabaroutine main paae jane vaale maan yaa text ko sidhe spredshit par likh saktaa he
 This figure represents the Visual Basic code for a subroutine in which the named column variable is the name of each member of x, calculates its class and writes that value to the corresponding element of the named column variable y
 y -stambh main koi sutara nahin he kyonki iske maan kaa pariklan sabaroutine main hota he, na ki spredshit par or keval andar likhaa jaataa he
 Whenever a reference is made to a cell or group of cells that are not located within the current physical spreadsheet file, it is treated as accessing a "remote" spreadsheet
 sandarbhit kaksh kii saamagree ko ek minial adhyatan ke saath pratham sandarbh par abhigam kiya ja saktaa he yaa web aadhaarit spredshits ke maamle main jaisaa abhi haal main hua, nirdisht swat:chaalit rifresh antaraal ke saath ek rial time maan ke rup main
 Many spreadsheet applications allow charts, graphs, or histograms that are generated from specified groups of cells that are dynamically constructed with changes in cell contents
 utpann graphic ghatak ko yaa to vartmaan shit main samahit kiya ja saktaa he yaa ek alag vastu ke rup main joda ja saktaa he
 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the first Javelin Software and later Lotus Improv appeared and, unlike a model in traditional spreadsheets, they use models that are built on objects called variables, Not on the data contained in the cells of a report
 These multi-dimensional spreadsheets enabled viewing data and algorithms in a number of self-documented forms, including multi-synchronized views
 For example, Javelin's users could move through a connection between variables on a diagram, and at the same time see the branches and logical roots of each variable
 yah udhaaharan he aarambhik Javelin ke praathmik yogadan kaa - jo thi iske baarah drishyon ke madhyam se ek upyogkarta ke tark yaa model sanrachana kii anumaargniyata kii avadharana
 ek jatil model ko vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or dusron dwaara samajha ja saktaa he jinka iske nirmaan main koi haath nahin he or yah aaj bhi adwitiya bana hua he
 Javelin was used primarily for financial modeling, but was also used in the creation of instructional models in college chemistry courses, in formatting the world's economies, and in the initial Star Wars project by the military
 It is still used today by organizations for which model integrity is an important mission

 Variables can have many characteristics, including complete information about their interaction with all other variables, data references, and text and image notes
 Counts were edited on these objects, which was in contrast to the range of cells, so adding two time series automatically adds them to calendar time, or to a user-defined time frame
 Data were independent of worksheet-variables, and therefore data cannot be destroyed by erasing a row, column, or entire worksheet
 For example, January costs are subtracted from January revenue, no matter whether or not both appear on the worksheet
 This allows actions that were used in the pivot table, except that the flexible manipulation of the report table was one of the many capabilities supported by variables
 iske alaava, agar laagat ko saptaah ke anusaar or rajasav ko maheene ke anusaar darj kiya gaya he, to Javelin kaa program sahi disha main aavantit yaa antarveshan kar saktaa he
 This object design enabled variables and the entire model to reference each other with user-defined variable names, and demonstrated multidimensional analysis and large-scale easily editable aggregations
 spredshit, jisamen ankaganit abhivyakti ke bajaay taarkik abhivyakti par aadhaarit sutara bhashaa he, unhen taarkik spredshit kehete hai
 Such spreadsheets can be used to reason deductively about their cell values

 While developing, spreadsheets began to use powerful programming languages such as VBA; In particular, they are functional, visual and multi-paradigm languages
 kai log, samaan anukramik program likhane ke bajaay spredshits main gananaa karne ke kaary ko aasaan pate hai
 This is due to two properties of spreadsheets
 ek 'spredshit program' ko saamaanya abhikalan kaaryon ke nishpaadan ke liye dizine kiya gaya he jiske liye vah praathmik sanghathankaree siddhant ke rup main samay ke bajaay sthanik sambandhon kaa prayog karata he

 ise aksar spredshit kaa nirbharta graph kaha jaataa he
 References between cells can benefit from spatial concepts such as relative position and absolute position, as well as named location, to make it easier to understand and manage spreadsheet formulas
 spredshit, aamtaur par swachaalit rup se kakshon ko adhyatan karne kaa prayaas karti he jab un kakshon ko jis par ve nirbhar karte hai badal diya gaya he
 Initial spreadsheets used simple techniques such as evaluating cells in a particular order, but modern spreadsheets calculate a minimum recombination order from a dependency graph
 baad ke spredshit main maanon ko utkram main prasaarit karne kii ek simit kshamta thi, jisase vah strot maanon ko is tarah badalata tha ki ek vishesh jawaab ek nishchit kaksh main pahunch jaataa tha
 Since the spreadsheet's class formulas are generally not invertible, however, this technique has somewhat limited significance
 kai avadharanaen, jo anukramik programing model main aam hai, spredshit duniya main unke hamroop hai
 For example, a sequential model of indexed loops is usually represented as a table of classes with similar formulas,
 jabaki spredshit maatraatmak modelling main aage badhane kii ore ek bada kadam hai, inamen kamiyaan bhi hai
 At the level of overall user benefit, the spreadsheet has several major drawbacks, most notably related to the unfriendliness of addresses of alpha numeric cells

 satvaahan pracheen bharat kaa ek rajvansh tha
 It ruled central South India from 230 BC to the second century
 yah maury vansh ke patan ke baad shaktishaalee hua tha
 They are mentioned in the 8th century BC
 ashok kii mrityu ke baad satvahanon ne khud ko swatantra ghoshit kar diya tha
 The first dynasty to carry the lead coin was the Satavahana dynasty, and that lead coin was brought from Rome
 pracheen bharat main maury vansh ke antargat pehali baar rajnatik evam saanskrithik ekta sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Later, the Satavahana dynasty carried this effort forward

 The Satavahana dynasty was established about fifty years before the defeat of the Maurya dynasty
 unka samrajya dakshin bharat kaa sabase pracheen or bada samrajya tha
 In contrast to the ever-changing dynastic landscape of North India, the Satavahanas established an empire in the Deccan unbreakable, indivisible and lasting for a long period, which ruled for nearly four and a half hundred years
 is kaal ke vishay main jitani jaankaree hamen praapt hui he usase hamen satvahanon kii vilakshantaa tathaa vibhinn kshetron main unki advithiya gatividhiyon kaa gyaan hota he
 If the statements of Puranas are to be believed, then the boundaries of this kingdom of Deccan extended to North India
 magadh is samrajya kaa ek hissaa tha, dakshini bharat main bhi failaav tha tathaa purvi se pashchimi samundra tak isaki simaaen vistrut thi
 The empire was formed by the coordination of different species of Malavas, Bhojas, Pathanikas, Rathikas, Andhra, Parindas and Dravidas etc
 of North and South India and in this view the Satavahana Empire was more than that of the Mauryan Empire in the area
 Was structured ye satvahanon dwaara madhya bharat tathaa dakkan main pradutt lambe evam shantipurna shashan kaal kaa hi parinaam tha ki kala evam sthapaty kaa vikaas hua jinke udhaaharan ham pashchim bharat kii shilaon main taraashi hui guhaaon tathaa purvi bharat ke stupon evam viharon main paa sakate he
 During this period, culture also developed immensely and the attraction of Prakrit language reached the courts
 yadhyapi satvaahan rajya ek hindu samrajya tha tathpi unke aadhin buddha dharm kaa advithiya vikaas hua
 There was also great progress in the areas of trade, commerce and water transport

 The number of inscriptions related to them is very less and even in the references given in this presented inscriptions, complete information about the Satavahanas is not available

 But due to the dissolution of these coins and the counterfeiting of some coins, many controversies have arisen
 is vishay main saahitiyik stroton ne to or bhi adhik niraash kiya he
 In the original Puranas, due to the parts connected in time, the information given about them in Satavahanas is no longer reliable
 saath hi vibhinn puraanon main satvahanon ke sandarbh main martaky na hone ke kaaran sthiti ore bhi sandehaaspad ho gai he
 Although the Brihada Katha composed by Gunadhaya is believed to have been written under the patronage of the Satavahana kingdom, this work is no longer found in its original form and based on this, the information given in the later versions is different from different scholars
 isi prakaar leelavati jo ki satvaahan shaasha kaal ke sainik abhiyaanon evam vijayon se sambandhit he, par bhi adhik adhik vishwaas nahi kiya ja saktaa
 For this reason, our information about the Satavahana period is limited
 satvahanon ke abhyuday tathaa unke mul nivas sthaan ko le kar vibhinn vidwaanon main gaharaa matbhed he
 The Satavahana and Shatakarni rulers mentioned in the inscriptions and coins are called in the Puranas by the names of Andhra, Andhra-death and Andhra
 is aadhaar par vidwaan is nirnay par pahunche he ki satvaahan athwa shatakarani raja andhron ke samatuly the
 According to Rappson, Smith and Bhandarkar, Satavahana rulers were related to Andhra country

 He is mentioned in the Aitareya Brahmin as a caste that was free from the influence of the Aryans

 Ashoka's inscriptions describe him as one of the people who were under the influence of his empire

 Possibly, he had freed himself
 upar varnit itihaaskaar yadhyapi andhrapradesh ko satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan maanate he tathaapi unki shakti ke kendra ko lekar in vidwaanon main matbhed hai
 Where Smith considers Sri Kakulam as the capital of Satavahanas or Andhra
 parantu satvaahan ke andhron ke saath sambandh ko lekar vidwaanon main matbhed he
 In the inscriptions of the Samavahana dynasty, the rulers of this period are consistently called Satavahanas or Shatakarnis
 saahitiyik granthon main inke liye yadakada shaali vaahan shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But in this context, the word Andhra is not used in any inscription of this dynasty
 duusari ore shilalekhon, sikkon tathaa saahitiyik sroton ke aadhaar par pashchimi bharat ko inkaa mul nivas sthaan mana gaya he
 Evidence of this fact is also found in the early inscriptions of Nanaghat and Saanchi
 is aadhaar par dow gopalchaari ne pratishthan tathaa uske aasapaas ke kshetra ke satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan mana he
 In addition VS Sukuthankar to Bellary district; h c Rai Chaudhary has considered the southern part of the other country and VV Mirashi as the original abode of Satavahanas on both sides of the river Ganges
 is aadhaar par satvahanon tathaa andhron kaa samatuly evam sajaatiy hona sandehaaspad hi he
 In this subject scholars have suggested that the Satavahanas started their early life in the Deccan and conquered Andhra Pradesh in a short time
 kaalaantar main jab shaq tathaa amir akramanon ke kaaran satvaahan samrajya ke pashchimi tathaa uttari kshetra unke haathon se jate rahe tab kadaachit unki shakti godavari tathaa krishna nadi ke madhya kshetra arthath andhra pradesh tak simit ho gai tathaa ab satvahanon ko andhron ke naam se janaa jane laga
 We do not even know about the origin of Satavahanas
 kuch vidwaanon ne unki tulana ashok ke shilalekhon main varnit satiyaputronse tathaa kuch ne plini dwaara varnit setai se kii he
 Some other scholars have defined the words Shatakarni and Satavahana on the basis of the term Bhasha Vigyan, irrespective of the importance of these words, but based on the inscriptions of the Satavahana dynasty it is almost certain that the Satavahanas were also Brahmins like the Sunga and Kanva rulers

 dogopalchaari ne bhi is tathy ko sweekaarte hue yah mana he ki satvaahan vansh kii sthapana lagbhag 235i0purv tathaa uskaa patan lagbhag 255 isvi main hua
 On the basis of the inscription of elephant elephants during the reign of Kharkhel, the ruler of Kalinga, Rappson believes the beginning of the Satavahana dynasty between 220 BCE and 211 AD, but there is a difference in various Puranas regarding the Yasan period of the Satavahanas
 ek ore jaha matsaypurana unka kul yasana kaal 460varsh bataata he vahiin duusari ore brahmanpurana main yah avadhi 456 varsh bataai gai he
 According to the Vayupurana, the Satavahanas ruled for 411 years while Vishnupuran considers their reign as 300 years
 duusari aar dow aar0 ji0 bhandarkar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana 72
73 i0purv ko maanate hai
 On the basis of a statement mentioned in the Puranas, he has believed that the "shunga Miryatya" Kanva rulers were the servants of the Shunga rulers and ruled alongside them like the Peshwas and the founder of the Satavahana dynasty named Simuk or Shishuka ruled the Kanva king
 After killing Sushraman, he killed both the Kanva and Shung dynasties and subjugated his empire
 parantu yah tathy avishwasaneey he kyoking ham yah bhalee-bhaanti jaanate he ki shunga tathaa kanv vansh ke shaskaon ne kabhi sanyukt rup se shashan nahi kiya tathaa kanv vansh ke sansthaapak vasudev kanv ne antim shunga shaasha devbhuti kii hatya kar shashan kii bagdor sambhaali thi
 The statement of Vayu Purana on the basis of which Dr Bhandarkar has misinterpreted, is rightly defined by Dr Rai Chaudhary
 unke anusaar yah gandyash maatra itnaa hi bataata he ki simuk ne jab kanv vansh kaa ant kar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana kii to usne un shunga upashaskaon bhi samaapt kar diya jo ki kanv vansh ke haathon shunga shaskaon ke parajeet hone ke baad bhi bache rah gaye the
 Hence, Satavahana rulers took over the reins of their rule by ending the Kanva dynasty in 29 BC
 parantu is sab karkon ke hote hue bhi is sambhaavna se inkaar nahi kiya ja saktaa ki simuk jisane 23varshon tak shashan kiya vah kuch samay pehle hi arthath pehali shatabdi i0pus0 ke madhya main hi singhasanarudh ho gaya hoga
 Simuk was the founder of the Satavahana dynasty and ruled for almost 23 years from 235 BC to 212 BC
 yadhyapi uske vishay main hamen adhik jaankaree nahi milti tathaapi puraanon se hamen yah gyaat hota he ki kanv shaskaon kii shakti kaa naash kar tathaa bache hue shunga mukhiyaaon kaa daman karke usne satvaahan vansh kii neenv rakhi
 In the Puranas, in addition to Symek, he is also called Shishuk, Sindhuk and Shiprak etc
 jain anushrutiyon ke anusaar simuk ne apane shashan kaal main jain tathaa buddha mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaaya, parantu apane shashan kaal ke antkaal main vah pathbhrasht tathaa croor ho gaya jis karanvash use padchyut kar uski hatya kar di
 After Simuk's death, his younger brother Kanha ascended the throne
 apane 18 varshon ke kaarykaal main kanha ne samrajya visataar kii niti ko apanaaya
 The inscription of Nashik suggests that the Satavahana empire spread west to Nashik in the time of Kanha
 shatakarni-p kanha ke uparant shatakarni pratham gaddi par baitha
 According to the Puranas, he was the son of Kanha
 parantu dow gopalchaari simuk ko shatakarni pratham kaa pita maanate hai
 Some scholars have believed that its rule lasted for two years, but Neelkanth Shastri has considered his reign from 194 BC to 185 BC
 jo bhi ho yah suspasht he ki uskaa shashan kaal bahut lambaa nahi tha
 But despite being short, the tenure of Shatkarni i is more important from some perspectives
 satvaahan shaskaon main vah pehla tha jisane is vansh ke shaskaon main priy evam prachlit, ‘‘shatakarni’’ shabd se apana namakaran kiya
 According to the Nanaghat inscription, Shatkarni expanded his empire and performed two Ashwamedha Yajna and one Rajasuya Yajna during his work
 uski rani nayanika ke ek shilaalekh se hamen yah gyaat hota he ki shatakarni pratham ne pashchimi malwa ke saath-saath anup tathaa vidarbha pradeshon bhi jeet liya
 If Shatkarni i is the only ruler mentioned in the archway of the Sanchi Stupa, it also proves that in his time central India was under the authority of the Satavahanas
 vah apane chhate se kaary kaal me samraat ban gaya tathaa usne dakshin pathpati tathaa apratihat chakra aadi oopaadhiyaan dhaaran kii
 It is suggested on the basis of the similarity of the script used in the Nanaghat article and the Elephant Gumpha writings, that perhaps in the second year of the reign of this Shatkarni rulers, the great ruler of Kalinga, Kharkhel was defeated in the battle field
 shatakarni pratham kii patni nayanika athwa naganika angeey kul ke ek maharathi trankairo kii putree thi
 After the death of Shatkarni I, his two minor sons Vedashree and Satashri sat on the throne
 parantu alpavyask hone ke kaaran prashasan kii sari bagdor unki maa nayanika ke haathon main aa gai jisane apane pita kii sahaayta se shashan chalaaya
 It seems that Vedashree died at a young age and Satshri took over as his successor
 parantu puraana is vishay main ekamat he ki shatakarni pratham ke pashchaat purnotsang naamak raja satvaahan singhaasana par asin hua
 Regardless of the name of the fourth Satavahana ruler, it is certain that it was during the reign of this ruler that Pushyamitra Sunga conquered the last Mauryan ruler Brahadratha and took over the kingdom of Magadha
 matsaypurana main skandastambhi kaa ullekh satvaahan vansh ke paanchaven shaasha ke rup main keya he parantu adhiktar vidwaan is naam ko kalpit maanate hai
 Shatkarni II ruled from about 166 BC to 111 BC
 yah kadaachit vahi shaasha tha jiskaa varnan hithigumpha tathaa bhilsa shilalekhon main hua he
 It seems that during its reign, the Satavahanas snatched eastern Malwa from a successor of Pushyamitra Sunga
 puraanon ke anusaar shatakarni dwitiya ke pashchaat lambodar rajsinghaasana par asin hua
 After Lambodar, his son Appellant ascended the throne
 apilak jo ki aathvaan satvaahan shaasha tha, in donaan ke madhya kaa kaal satvahanon ke sandarbh main andhkaar yug mana gaya he jisamen keval kuntal shatakarni ke kaal ko hi apwaad mana ja saktaa he
 Kuntal Shatkarni was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas after the appellant
 kamasutra main vatsayan ne kuntal shatakarni kaa ullekh karte hue likhaa he ki usne apni ungaliyon ko kanchi ke rup main prayog kiya tathaa iske prahaar se uski pataraani malayavati kii mrityu ho gai
 In Kavyamamsha, Rajeshwar describes Kuntal Shatkarni as saying that he had ordered his queens living in his Raniwas to use only Prakrit language
 haal satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatpurna shaasha tha
 Although he ruled only four years, his reign was very important in some subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yadi aarmabhik satvaahan shaskaon main shatakarni pratham yoddha ke rup main sabase mahaan tha to haal shantidoot ke rup main agrani tha
 Hall also had a literary interest and became famous as a poet emperor
 uske naam kaa ullekh puraana, leelavati, saptshati, abhidhaan chintamani aadi granthon main hua he
 It is believed that Saptashati or Satsai was written recently in the Prakrit language
 brihadakatha ke lekhak gunanty bhi haal kaa samakaleen tha tathaa kadaachit pashachi bhashaa main likhi is pustak kii rachana usne haal hi ke sangrakshan main kii thi
 In Kalantar, the three books named Buddhavami's Brihakatha-'ilok-sangra ', Kshemendra's brihadatha-manjari and Somdev's Kathasaritasagar originated from the Briha story of Gunadhya
 haal ke pradhan senapati vijayanand ne apane swami ke aadeshaanusaar srilanka par akraman kar use jeet liya
 While returning from this conquest, he stopped for some time at a place called Sapta Godavari Bhimam
 vahaan vijayanand ne srilanka ke raja kii ati rupavaan putree leelavati kii charchaa suni jiskaa varnan usne apane raja haal se kiya
 Hall tried to marry Lilavati
 kivdanti he ki haal ne purvi dakkan main kuch sainik abhiyaan kiye parantu saakshyon ke abhaav main adhiktar vidwaan ise galat maanate hai
 However, in the recent reign of Satavahana rulers, in addition to the political field, there was a lot of development in literary and economic areas as well as the development of trade and commerce cities and the advancement of water transport which during the reign of second Mundlak or Puridransen in the first century AD
 Reached its culmination, however, for about fifty years to come proved very difficult for the Satavahana Empire Happened
 aisa prathit hua maano ke pashchim kshatrapon ke rup main hue videshi akraman ke saath hi satvaahan samrajya kaa patan hone ko he
 The Kushans were spreading in the north-west and under their pressure, the Shaka and Pahlav rulers were eager to fight with the Satavahanas, attracted towards central and western India
 kshahraat vansh ke pashchimi kshatrapon ne apane ko pashchima raajputana, gujarat tathaa kathiyawad main sthapit kar liya tha
 These Shaka rulers attacked the Satavahana kingdom from 35 AD to about 90 AD
 unhone satvahanon se purvi tathaa payichama malwa pradeshon ko jeeta; uttari konkan uttari maharashtra, jo ki satvaahan shakti kaa kendra tha tathaa banavaasi tak faile dakshini maharashtra par bhi apana prabhutv jamaa liya
 The first ruler of the Kshatra dynasty was Ghoomak whose sources of information are some coins which have been found mostly from the coastal region of Gujarat Kathiawar and Yadakada Malwa
 ghumak kaa uttaradhikari nahpaan tha jisaki jaankaree hamen uske bahusankhya sikkon par raja kii oopaadhi dhaaran kii he
 At the same time, inscriptions got his titles Kshatrap and Mahakshatrap
 nasik, karle tathaa junar ke uske shilaalekh; esake bahusankhya sikken tathaa uske jamata shaq ashavdaat ke dwaara uttari tathaa dakshini bharat main die gaye daan sab ke sab ye pramanit karte hai ki nahpaan ke samay main kshahraat vansh kaa samrajya kaaphi vistut tha tathaa usne satvaahan shaskaon se kaaphi bada pradesh chin kar hi apane samrajya ko itnaa vishaal banaaya tha
 Nahapan and his Jamaat Shaka Ashwadat unleashed the Satavahana power in the western Deccan by conquering Malwa, the Narmada Valley, northern Konkan, the western part of Berar and and southern Maharashtra
 ve satvaahan raja jo nahpaan ke haathon parajeet hue kadaachit sundar shatakarni, chakor shatakarni tathaa shivsaati the jinka ki kaarykaal bahut hi chota tha parantu yah paristhitiyaan adhik samay tak nahi chali tathaa gautami putr shri shatakarni ke satvaahan shaasha banate hi is kshahraat-satvaahan sangharsh main nayaa mode aayaa
 After nearly half a century of turmoil and honor at the hands of the Shaka rulers, Gautami reestablished his lost reputation under the leadership of son Shatkarni
 gautami putr shri shatakarni satvaahan vansh kaa sabase mahaan shaasha tha jisane lagbhag 25 varshon tak shashan karte hue na keval apane samrajya kii khoi pratishtha ko purnsthapit kiya apitu ek vishaal samrajya kii bhi sthapana kii
 In the time of Gautami's son and his victories, we get complete information from the Nashik inscriptions of his mother Gautami Balashree
 kuch visheshgyon dwaara gautamiputra satkarni ko raja shalivahan bhi mana jaataa he
 He united the whole of India and defended against foreign invaders
 uske sandarbh main hamen is lekh se yah jaankaree milti he ki usne kshatriyon ke ahankaar kaa maan-mardan kiya
 He is described as the doer of Saka, Yavan and Pahlav Sasakas
 uski sabase badi uplabdhi kshahraat vansh ke shaq shaasha nahpaan tathaa uske vanshajon kii uske haathon hui paraajay thi
 The silver coins of Nahapan obtained from the Jogalthambi group which Gautami's son Shatkarni reintroduced and in the eighteenth year of his reign, by Gautami's son making a cavity at Pandu-lan near Nashik - these are some of the facts that prove that he Rejuvenated the territories taken away by the Shaka rulers
 nahpaan ke saath unka yuddh uske shashan kaal ke 17wein or 18wein varsh main hua tathaa is yuddh main jeet kar rgatmi putr ne aparant, anup, saurashtra, cooker, akar tathaa avanti ko nahpaan se chin liya
 Apart from these areas, Gautami's son also had dominion over Rishik, Ayamak, Moolak and Vidarbha etc
 uske pratyaksh prabhaav main rahane vaala kshetra uttar main malwa tathaa kathiyawad se lekar dakshin main krishna nadi tak tathaa puvai main baraar se lekar pashchim main konkan tak failaa hua tha
 He assumed the title 'tri-sea-toy-yellow-vehicle', indicating that his influence was in the eastern, western and southern seas, that is, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean
 aisa prathit hota he ki apni mrityu ke kuch samay pehle gautami putr shatakarni dwaara nahpaan ko haraakar jite gaye kshetra uske haath se nikal gaye
 Those who snatched these territories from Gautami's son were probably the Shaka rulers of the Kardamak dynasty of the Scythian race
 iskaa pramaan hamen talami dwaara bhugol kaa varnan karti uski pustak se miltaa he
 a similar conclusion can also be drawn from the famous Rudradaman inscription of Junagadh of 150 AD
 yah shilaalekh darshata he ki nahpaan se vijit gautamiputra shatakarni ke sabhi pradeshon ko usase rudradaman ne hathiyaa liya
 It appears that Gautamiputra Shatkarni attempted to secure his territories captured by Rudradaman by establishing matrimonial relations with the Kardamak Shakas

 isliye inako 'shaashvat' mana jaataa he 
 Here in ancient texts, Tirthankaras and ascetic saints attained salvation through rigorous penance and meditation
 yahi kaaran he ki jab sammed shikhar tirthayatra shuru hoti he to har tirthayatri kaa man tirthankarasn kaa samaran kar apaar shraddha, aasthaa, utsaah or khushi se bharaa hota he
 It is written in Jainism scriptures that once a soulful pilgrimage to the Samkad Shikhar shrine in one's life, a person does not get animal vagina and hell after death
 yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki jo vyakti sammed shikhar aakar puure man, bhav or nishtha se bhakthi karata he, use moksh praapt hota he or is sansar ke sabhi janm-karm ke bandhanon se agle 49 janmon tak mukt vah rahata he
 All this is possible only when all the devotees here remember the Tirthankaras and follow the teachings, teachings and principles given by them with pure conduct
 is prakaar yah kshetra bahut pavitra mana jaataa he
 The natural violent behavior of wild animals like lions, tigers, etc
 found here is not seen due to the sanctity and sattvikta of this region
 is kaaran tirthayatri bhi bina bhay ke yatra karte hai
 It is probably because of this effect that many kings, Acharyas, Bhattaraks, Shravaks from ancient times came here with huge groups for pilgrimage in the spirit of self-welfare and salvation, worshiping Tirthankaras, meditating and performing rigorous penance

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Pythagorean theorem ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 The Pythagorean theorem is a relation theorem between all three sides of a right triangle in Euclide geometry
 is prameya ko aamtaur par ek sameekaran ke rup main nimnlikhit tareeke se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he- Where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides
 pithagoras yunaan ke ganitagya the
 Traditionally, he is credited with the discovery of this theorem, although it is believed that the information of this theorem dates back to him
 bharat ke pracheen granth boudhayan shulbasutra main yah prameya diya hua he
 There is considerable evidence that the Babylonian mathematicians also knew this theory
 ise 'boudhayan-pithagoras prameya' bhi kehete hai
 If we take the length of the hypotenuse c and the length of the other two sides a and b, then the theorem can be expressed as the following equation: yaa, If c is already given and the length of one arm is to be derived, the following equation can be used: yaa This equation provides a simple relation between the three sides of a right-angled triangle
 is prameya kaa samanyikaran 'kojya niyam' kehalaata he jisaki sahaayta se kisi bhi trikon ke teesri bhujaa kii lambaai kii gananaa kii ja sakati he yadi shesh do bhujaaon kii lambaai or unke bich ke kone kii maap di gayi ho
 This is a theorem that has probably the most evidence compared to other theorems
 elisha scot loomis dwaara rachit paaythagorian theram kitaab main, 367 pramaan die gaye hai
 Like most of the proofs of the Boudhayan theorem, it is based on the property of being proportional to the arms of two identical triangles
 mana ABC ek samakon tribhuj he, jisamen kone c samakon he, jaisaa akruti main dikhaaya gaya he
 We draw a perpendicular to the hypotenuse from point c and the length of that length with arm AB is H
 yah nayaa trikon ACH hamaare trikon ABC ke samroop he, kyonki un donon main hi samakon he or a kone unka hissaa he
 This means that the third angle is also the same in both triangles
 isi aadhaar par tribhuj CBH bhi ABC ke samroop he
 From these analogies we get two proportions: jaise And inhen aise bhi likhaa ja saktaa he Summarizing these two equations, anya shabdon main, boudhayan prameya: In Euclid's Elements, Proposition 47 of Book 1, the Boudhayan theorem is proved by an argument along the following lines
 A, B, c ko samakon trikon ke kone maanate hai, jisamen samakon a par hoga
 a se karn ke vipareet ek adholamb chhoden varg main karn par
wo rekha karn par varg ko do aaayaaton main vibhajit karti he, prayek kaa samaan kshetra he kyunki donon main se ek pairon main varg banataa he
 For formal proof, we need four primary lemmata: is pramaan ke peeche sahaj vichaar, jo iskaa paalan karnaa aasaan bana saktaa he, ki upar ke do virgon ko ek hi aakaar ke samanaantar chaturbhuj main badla gaya he, phir modakar or baayen or daahine aayat ko nichle varg main badla gaya he, phir nirantar kshetra main
 The proof is as follows: yah pramaan euclid ke tatwon main prastaav 1
47 ke rup main pesh hota he
 James A
 Garfield is credited with a novel algebraic proof: puraa samalamb bai varg kaa aadha he, to uskaa kshetrafal = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 Each area of triangle 1 and triangle 2 is ab / 2
 trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal c2 / 2 he or yah karn par varg kaa aadha he
 But also the area of triangle 3 = - isliye karn par varg = anya do parshvon ke virgon kaa jod he
 In this proof, one can add 4 copies of square plus triangle on the hypotenuse as squares on the other two sides plus 4 copies of triangle
 This proof has been recorded from China
 upar euclid ke pramaan ke chitra se, ham teen samaan aankadon ko dekh sakate hai, prayek main "ek varg ke upar trikon" he
 Because the larger triangle is made up of two smaller triangles, its area is the sum of these two smaller ones
 samanta se, teen varg ek duusare ke saath usee anupaat main hai jaise vah teen trikon or isi tarah ke bade varg kaa kshetrafal do chote virgon ke kshetrafal kaa jod he
 Evidence from the anagram is given through illustration and animation
 is udhaaharan main, har ek bade varg kaa kshetrafal 2 he
 In both, the area of the same triangle is removed
 shesh kshetron, a2 + b2 or c2, baraabar hai
 QED yah pramaan vastav main bahut aasaan he, lekin yah praarambhik nahin he, is arth main ki yah keval sabase buniyadi siddhant or yucalidian jyamiti ke pramayon par nirbhar nahin he
 In particular, while it is very easy to give the formula for the area of triangles and squares, it is not easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of the areas of its pieces
 vastav main, aavashyak gun sabit karnaa paaythagorian prameya siddh karne kii tulana main kathin he 
vastav main, yah kathinaayee sabhi saadhaaran kshetra shaamil yucalidian pramaan ko prabhavit karata he; udhaaharan ke liye, ek samakon trikon kaa kshetra paane ke liye ek dharna shaamil he ki yah ek hi oonchai or tal ke ek aayat kaa aadha kshetra he
 For this reason, axiomatic introduction to geometry generally uses another proof based on the similarity of triangles
 is paaythagorian prameya kaa teesraa graphic chithran main karn kaa varg parshvon ke varg main feet baithta he
 a related proof may show that the restored parts are identical to the original and, because the sum of the same is the same, that their areas are also the same
 yah dikhaane ke liye kii ek varg hi parinaam he, hame nae parshvon kii lambaai ko c ke baraabar dikhaanaa padegaa
dhyaan den kii is pramaan ke kaam karne ke liye, hame chote varg ko or adhik hisson main kaatane ke tareeke ko sanbhaalane ke liye rasta pradaan karnaa hoga chunki parshv or chote hote jaayenge
 The algebraic variation of this proof is provided by the following argument
 chithran ko dekhte hue jo ek bada varg he jiske konon main samaan samakon trikon he, in chaar trikon main prayek kaa kshetra c ke saath ek kone ke dwaara diya gaya he
 The A-lateral angles and B-lateral angles of these triangles are the supplementary angles, each of the angles of the blue region are right angles, making this area a square whose side length is C
 is varg kaa kshetrafal he C2
is tarah samast kaa kshetra diya jaataa he: However, the length of the sides of the larger square is a + B, we can calculate its area as 2, which extends into A2 + 2AB + B2
 boudhayan prameya main pahunchaa ja saktaa he nimnlikhit chitra ke adhyayan se kii ek parshv main parivartan kaise karn main ek parivartan ke utpaadan kar saktaa he or ek thoda kalan kaa upyog karke
 As a result of the change in side of a, da, trikon kii samanta or antar main badlaav ke liye
isliye On the separation of variables
 parshv b main parivartan ke liye ek doosraa kaarykaal jodne kaa parinaam he
 Consolidated returns jab a = 0 tab c = b, to b2 "nirantar" he
 So jaise dekha ja saktaa he, parivartan or parshvon ke bich vishesh anupaat ke kaaran he yah varg jabaki parshvon main parivartan kii swatantra yogadan kaa parinaam raashi he jo jyamitiya saakshyon se spasht nahin he
 From this given ratio it can be shown that the changes in the sides are inversely proportional to the sides
 is vibhedak sameekaran suzav detaa he kii yah prameya sambandhit parivartan ke kaaran he or iske vyutpatti lagbhag line abhinn abhikalan ke samaan he
 This quantity da and dc are very small changes in a and c respectively
 lekin ham iske badale vaastavik sankhya Δa and Δc kaa upyog karte hai, tab unke anupaat kii seemaa da / dc he jab unka aakaar shunya nikatataa, vyutpanni or c / a bhi nikatataa he, trikon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa anupaat or vibhedak sameekaran kaa parinaam pataa chalata he
 The antonym of this theorem is also true: kisi bhi teen dhanatmak sankhya a, b or c aisi he a2 + b2 = c2, vahaan ek trikon maujuud he jiske parshv hai a, b or c or har aise trikon main parshvon ke bheech ek samakon he jinaki lambaai a or b he
 This antonym is present in the elements of Euclid
 kosine kii vidhi kaa prayog karke yah sabit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa nimnlikhit pramaan ke dwaara: Let ABC be a triangle whose sides are a, b and c, with a2 + b2 = c2
 We have to prove that the angles between a and b sides are right angles
 ham ek or trikon kaa nirmaan karte hai jisamen parshvon ke bich ek samakon he jisaki lambaai a or b he
 From the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse length of this triangle is also c
 chunki donon trikon ke parshvon kii ek hi lambaai he a, b or c, ve anukool hai or isliye unka ek hi kone hona chahie
isliye, jin parshvon kii lambaai a or b he hamaare mul trikon main unke bich kaa kone ek samakon he
 An approximation of the inverse of the Pythagorean theorem is a simple way of determining if a triangle is right-angled, obtuse, or acute, thus
 Where c is chosen as the longest of the three sides: ek paaythagorian tripal main teen sakaaratmak purnank hai a, b or c, jaise kii a2 + b2 = c2
anya shabdon main, ek paaythagorian tripal ek samakon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa varnan karata he jahaan teenon parshv kii purnank lambaai he
 Evidence from large stone monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triplets were known before the discovery of writing
 is tarah ke tripal saamanytah se likhe gaye hai 
kuch prasiddh udhaaharan hai or ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, paaythagorian prameya ke parinaamon main se ek he ki taratamyaheen lambaai, jaise kii 2 kaa vargamul, banaaya ja saktaa he
 a right angle whose legs are equal to one unit has the square root of its hypotenuse length 2
 yah pramaan ki 2 kaa vargamul tarkahin he lambey samay se yojit vishwaas ke vipareet tha ki sab kuch tarksangat tha
 According to legend, Hippasus, who first proved the irrationality of the square root of two, was drowned at sea as a result
 kaatizian nirdeshaank main duurastha formula ko paaythagorian prameya se se praapt kiya gaya he
 If and are points in the square, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by atirikt saamanytah se, yucalidian main n-antar, do binduon ke bich kii yucalidian duuri, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,} or a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,}, paaythagorian prameya kaa upyog karte hue, paribhaashit kiya gaya he: The Boudhayan theorem was generalized among Euclid's elements: agar koi ek samaan aankade khadaa karata he ek samakon trikon ke parshvon main, to do chhoton ke kshetron kaa jod bade ke kshetrafal ke baraabar he
 The Baudhayan theorem is a special case of the more general theorem related to the length of the sides, the method of cosine: is jatil aantarik utpaada antariksh main do vector v or w diya jaae, to boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit rup le leti he: In particular, || v + w || 2 = || v || 2 + || w || 2 if v and w are rectangles, although the antonym is not necessarily true
 ganitiya preran kaa prayog karke, pichhlaa parinaam kisi parimit sankhya ke jodon main ayty vector tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Any finite number of k can be increased
 v1, v2,


, vn ko vector maanate hai ek aantarik utpaada antariksh main jisamen = 0 jab 1 ≤ i γ hota he
 Therefore, a2 + b2> c2
 jin trikon main ek obtyus kone hota he, α + β < γ hota he
 Therefore, a2 + b2 <c2 occurs
 edsjar disxtra ne is prastaav ko acut, samakon or obtyus trikon ke bare main is bhashaa main kaha he: Where angle α is opposite to lateral a, angle β is opposite to lateral b and angle γ is opposite to lateral c
 yucalidian jyamiti ke siddhant se paaythagorian prameya se praapt hua he, vastav main, upar bataae paaythagorian prameya kaa yucalidian prakaar bina yucalidian jyamiti ke nahin hota he
 Is shown to be equivalent to self-respect
 ) udhaaharan ke liye, goleey jyamiti main, octate se simit ikai kshetra ke samakon trikon ke teenon parshvon kii lambaai π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} ke baraabar he; yucalidian paaythagorian prameya kaa ulanghan karti he kyunki π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} This means that in the Euclidean theorem, the Pythagorean theorem must take a different form from the Euclidean theorem
 Here two cases have to be considered - spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; In every case, like the Euclidean case, the law of proper cosine results in: ek gola jisaki trigya r he usapar koi bhi samakon trikon ke liye, paaythagorian prameya yah rup letaa he This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines
 is kosine samaaroh ke liye mcclaurin shrinkhalaa kaa upyog karke, yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki trigya r anantta tak pahunchataa he, ke rup main he, paaythagorian prameya kaa golakaar rup yucalidian rup tak pahunchataa he
 For any triangle in this hyperbolic plane, the Pythagorean theorem takes this form jahaan cosh ke atishyoktipurna kosine he
 Using the mclaurin series for this function, it can be shown that the exaggerated form of the Pythagorean theorem is closely related to the Euclidean form, as the hyperbolic triangle becomes very small
 atishyoktipurna jyamiti main, ek samakon trikon ke liye bhi likhaa ja saktaa he, Where a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} is the angle of equality of the line segment now that a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} where μ is the multiplication distance function
 atishyoktipurna trikonmiti main, sin ke kone kii samanta santusht karata he Thus, this equation takes the form jahaan a, b, and c samakon trikon ke parshvon kii ganaatmak dooriyaan hai 
 The distance between the points {and {in 3 dimensions is √2 + 2)] 2 + 2) = √2 + 2 + 2) and similarly for 4 or more dimensions
 paaythagoras formula ko cartigian nirdeshaank samtal main do ankon ke bich kii duuri pataa karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he or maanya he agar sab nirdeshaank asli hai: ank {2+2)
lekin jatil nirdeshaank ke saath: udhaaharan, ank { or {i,0} ke bich kii duuri shunya banegi, jiskaa parinaam he ridakshio ed absurdam
yah isliye he kyonki yah formula paaythagoras kii prameya par nirbhar he, jo apane has pramaan main kshetrafal par nirbhar he or kshetrafal trikon par nirbhar he or anya jyamitiya aankadon par jo andar ko bahaar se alag karti he, jo mumkin nahin hota agar nirdeshaank jatil hote
 The history of this theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of the Pythagorean triple, knowledge of the relationship between right triangle triangles, knowledge of the relationship between adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem

 The Apastamba Sulba formula contains numerical evidence of the general Pythagorean theorem, using a field computation
 Vonr Varden believes "it was certainly based on earlier traditions"
 According to Albert Burke, this is the original proof of the theorem

 According to Heath, Pythagoras had no attribution of the theorem until Pythagoras survived for five centuries
 However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicerou held the Pythagorean theorem, they did so in a way that would make the planting widely known and undoubtedly are
