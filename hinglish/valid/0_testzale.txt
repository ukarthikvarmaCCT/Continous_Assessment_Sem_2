 homeopathy, ek chikitsa paddati he
 Dr
 Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann is the father of homeopathy medical science
 yah chikitsa ke 'samarupata ke sinddhaat' par aadhaarit he jiske anusaar aushadhiyaan un rogon se milte julate rog dur kar sakati hai, jinhen ve utpann kar sakati hai
 The curative power of the drug depends on the symptoms that may arise
 jinhen rog ke lakshanon ke samaan kintu unase prabal hona chahie
 Therefore, the disease can be determined and destroyed with the help of the same medicine, which can produce all the symptoms in the human body, strong with the symptoms and very similar to the symptoms
 homeopathy paddati main chikitsak kaa mukhya kaary rogi dwaara bataae gaye jivan-itihaas evam rogalakshanon ko sunakar usee prakaar ke lakshanon ko utpann karanevaali aushadhi kaa chunaav karnaa he
 The greater the similarity between disease symptoms and drug symptoms, the greater the chances of a patient becoming healthy
 chikitsak kaa anubhav uskaa sabase bada sahaayak hota he
 Treatment of chronic and difficult diseases requires patience for both the patient and the physician
 kuch homeopathy chikitsa paddati ke samarthakon kaa mat he ki rog kaa kaaran sharir main shoravish kii vruddhi he
 Homeopathy practitioners believe that every living being we have a tendency to maintain the functional ideal of the senses and when this functional ideal is distorted, then the creature has many reactions to achieve this ideal
 praani ko aushadhi dwaara keval uske prayaas main sahaayta milti he
 The medicine should be given in small amounts, because in the disease, the patient is hyper-sensitive
 aushadhi kii alp maatra prabhavakaari hoti he jisase keval ek hi prabhaav prakat hota he or koi dushaprinaam nahin hote
 This monotonic effect is regulated in the restoration of health due to the modulated aggregation of tissues in the morbid state
 vidwaan homeopathy ko chhadam vigyaan maanate hai
 The basic principle of homeopathy promoted by Dr
 Hahnemann is - "similia simivibus curator" means diseases that are safely, quickly and very effectively cured by drugs that are capable of producing symptoms similar to the patient's symptoms
 duusare shabdon main, is niyam ke anusaar jis aushadhi kii adhik maatra swasth sharir main jo vikaar paidaa karti he usee aushadhi kii laghu maatra vaise samalakshan vaale prakritik lakshanein ko nasht bhi karti he
 For example, the symptoms of colds on cutting raw onions such as water coming out of the nose and eyes, in the same type of cold, giving homeopathic medicine alium cepa can also be cured
 homeopathy main rogiyon ko ek samay main ek hi aushadhi ko dene kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 On the basis of experience, Hahnemann decided to legislate only one drug at a time, but now this opinion has changed enough
 aadhunik chikitsakon main se kuch to hanemaan ke bataae maarg par chal rahe hai or kuch logon ne apana swatantra maarg nishchit kiya he or ek baar main do, teen aushadhiyon kaa prayog karte hai
 On the basis of similar science, the amount of medicine selected by the patient should be very low so that the side effects of the medicine are not seen
 prathmat: yah sharir kii pratirohak kshamta ko safal karne main ghatak kaa kaam karata he
 Homoeopathic medicine is specially prepared which is called the name of drug empowerment
 thius padaarthon ko trcuration or taral padaarthon ko sacshan pranali se taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 This is a basic theme
 yah sach bhi he ki homeopathy rogon ke naam par chikitsa nahin karti
 In fact, it treats all aspects of mental, emotional and physical aspects of a person suffering from the disease
 asthma ke paanch rogiyon kii homeopathy main ek hi dawa se chikitsa nahin kii ja sakati
 Depending on the overall symptom, it may be prescribed different medicines in five patients
 haniman ne manushya ke sharir main jeevani shakti ko pahchaan kar yah pratipaadit kiya ki yah jeevani shakti sharir ko bahya rup se akraman karne vaale rogon se bachaati he
 But in the condition of disease, this biographical power becomes disease
 sadrush vigyaan ke aadhaar par chayan kii gai aushadhi is jeevani shakti ke vikaar ko nasht kar sharir ko rog mukt karti he
 Hahnemann found that the underlying causes of all chronic diseases are psoriasis, psychosis, and syphilis
 inako haniman ne miasm shabd diya jiskaa unani arth he - pradooshit karnaa
 It is necessary to have knowledge of their therapeutic ability to use medicine for medicine
 aushadhi pramann homeopathy main aisi prakiya he jisame aushadhiyon kii swasth manushyon main prayog karke dawa ke mul lakshanein kaa gyaan kiya jaataa he
 Certification of these drugs is done on healthy humans and diseases are treated with the help of similar science based on the knowledge of the symptoms caused by them
 is chikitsa paddati kaa mahatvapurn paksh aushadhi samarthy he
 Initially, Hanaman used to use medicines of high potency, but from experience he found the use of medicines of low potency effective
 unhone paaya ki anekon baar jahaan beemaari ke shaareerik parivartan yaa bahya kaarak maujuud hai vahaan nimnasamarthy kii aushadhi behatar kaary karti he
 Three types of scales are used in homeopathic medicine - isamen main dawa ke ek bhaag ko vehicle ke nau bhaag main milakar triturate yaa succussion kii prakriya kii jaati he
 The scale of the medicine made from them is known by the word "x" like black phos 6x, aconite 3x etc
 adhikanshtayah thos aushadhiyon main prayukt kii jane vaali is is scale main 1x banane ke liye dawa kaa ek bhaag or dugdh-sharkara kaa 9 bhaag lete hai, taral aushadhiyon main 1x banane hetu ek bhaag mulark or 9 bhaag alcohol kaa prayog hota he
 Beyond this, take one part of 1x and 9 parts of milk sugar or alcohol for 2x; In order to make many potencies like this, by taking a part of the previous potency, you increase the power ahead
 isamen dawa ke ek bhaag ko vehicle ke 99 bhaag se sakkashan kiya jaataa he
 The drugs made from them are known by the power of medicine "c"
 jaise 30c, 200c, 1000c aadi
 Succession is not just about mixing the original extracts of the drug with alcohol, but it has to be done
 aajkal sakkashan ke liye swachaalit mashin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jab ki puraane samay main yah swayan hi haath se banani hoti thi
 To make the first potency, one part of the original drug extract and 99 parts alcohol is taken, suctioning it 10 times to prepare the first potency; Similarly for the second potency, one part of the previous potency and 99 parts alcohol; Similarly, further potency is prepared
 homeopathy ke virodh ke kaarnon main ek pramukh kaaran homeopathic aushadhiyon kii nune maatra bhi he
 Homeopathy drugs are in the form of extracts, extracts and diluents and some are washed in ether or glycerin, such as serpents
 arq mukhyatya pashu tathaa vanaspati jagat se vyutpann hai
 These are called distinctive rasas, root extracts or matics tinctures and symbolized by the Greek letter 'theta'
 matrix tinchar tathaa sampeshan se vibhinn samarthyon ko taiyaar karne kii vidhiyaan samaan hai
 Medicines of different strengths are prepared in diluents
 mulark se prarambh karne ke baad tanuta ke mapkram main ham jyon-jyon upar badhate hai, tyon-tyon aprishkrut padaarth se dur hatate jate hai yahi kaaran he ki homeopathy vidhi se nirmit aushadhiyaan saamanytah vishaheen evam ahaanikaarak hoti hai

 Woodrow Wilson woodro wilson america ke 28 wein raashtrapati the
 Wilson is known as an academic scholar, administrator, historian, jurist and politician who explained the functions of public administration
 woodro wilson kaa janm 28 disambar 1856 ko america ke varjeenia praant main hua tha
 He graduated from Princeton University in 1879, studying politics, administration and law
 princeton vishvavidhyalay se hi 1886 main wilson ne piech
 di
 kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 His first work was published by the Congress Government in 1884
 wilson 1886 se lekar 1902 tak raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor rahe
 During the period from 1902 to 1910, he held the post of President of Princeton University
 wilson ko 1910 main new jersey rajya kaa governor chunaa gaya
 In 1912 Wilson was elected the 28th President of the United States
 ve 8 varshon tak america ke raashtrapati ke pad rahane ke baad sevanivrutt ho gayi
 In 1919 Wilson received the Nobel Prize for Peace
 1924 main mastishk aghat se unka nidhan ho gaya
 Woodrow Wilson would not have even dreamed that he would one day become President of the United States
 bahut kam aise log hai jo is pad par raajnneetik aparipakvatapurna vyaktitv se pahunche honge
 But after becoming President no one would have acted with as much perseverance, prudence, nation-building efficiency and duty-devotion as Wilson, the Messiah of Peace
 ek bhavishyadrushtataa or adarshavaadi hote hue bhi vah linkan ke baad sabase acha adhik yathartwaadee or nipun raajnneetik netaa tha
 But no one knew in 1913 that Wilson would become a great man
 koi nahin jaanata tha ki wilson dwaara sanyukt rajya america ko pratham vishwayuddh main bhaag na lene ke sabhi prayatnon ke baavjood bhi us raashtra ko yuddh main nirnaayak bhaag lenaa hoga
 Nobody knew that he would go beyond the Atlantic to try to give permanent peace to the world, and his efforts would be destroyed at the altar of selfishness and domestic petty opposition by some European politicians
 kisi america raashtrapati ne apane hi aadarshon evam yojanaon ko apane hi logon dwaara nirdayatapurvak nirast evam parajeet hote hue nahin dekha hoga
 Wilson was a professor of political science
 atev vah chintak tha
 He wrote extensive texts on American administration
 uskaa vichaar tha ki karypalika evam vyavasthapika main shakti ke bantwaare se shashan main saamanjasy nahin ho paaya
 Therefore, he wished that the American President should be as powerful as the Prime Minister of England
 jab vah raashtrapati bana to usne nihsandeh apane vichaaron ko karyanvit kar raashtrapati kii shashan kaa shaktishaalee kendra-bindu banaaya
 There was bold boldness in it, a senseless sincerity
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki satvik kaaryon kii sadaiv vijay hogi or satya ke pratinidhiyon ko asaty, avivek evam aadambar se samjhauta nahin karnaa chaiye
 In the early years of his reign, he attracted the attention of the entire public
 usne sampoorn rashtriya jivan main samarpan, tyaag evam naitikta kii bhaavana ko prerit kiya
 But he became so proud of himself for his sattvikta and purposes that he started thinking that those who opposed him were opposing God
 usamen linkan kii vinamrata kaa abhaav tha
 In his election campaign, he gave the slogan of Progressivism, abandoning the conservative views of the past
 raashtrapati banane ke baad usne apane vyaktitv main samjhautavaadi jivan grahan nahin kiya, haalanki raashtrapati pad ke namakan ke liye usne us bryan kii bhi bahut prashansa kii thi jiske sambandh main uski dharna yah thi ki ‘use kachare main phank dena chahie
 In fact, his personality was a combination of many qualities
 vah khushaamad pasandagi kii evam vinamr ghoosekhori kii kala se parichit tha, lekin saath hi vah gahari naitikta, dayaa evam samvedansheel vritti kaa bhi tha
 He used to identify good and bad
 usamen ‘purv vimaan’, plato ke ‘darshanik raja’ evam maikiyavali ke ‘rajkumaar’ ke tattvon kaa samavesh tha
 Like Lincoln, he proved worthy of his responsibility over time
 wilson shaanti ke rajnay main vishwaas karata tha, matbhedon ko vaarta ke rajnay dwaara sulajhane kaa pakshdhar tha
 He was idealistic
 jab duusari baar vah raashtrapati chunaa gaya tab use is baat kii gambheer chintaa thi ki vishwa kii tanaavpurn sthiti ko dekhte hue america ko tatasthta ke paaydaan par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 Wilson was an advocate of peace
 vah acchhee tarah jaanata tha ki vishwa yuddh main america pradesh se amarikiyon kii vichaardhaara, darshan evam sahitya par yupriyata kaa baari prabhaav padegaa
 Wilson presented the American proposals for peace, which were rejected by the European powers
 america ne tatasthta kii ghoshnaa kii
 On 4 September 1914, in his diplomatic reference to the Congress, Wilson said- "this situation is not created by us but it is in front of us
" yah hamen pratyaksh rup se prabhavit karti he maano ham un paristhitiyon ke bhagidaar hai jinhone ise janm diya he
 We will pay for it even though we have not intentionally given birth to it
 “ america mahayuddh se achoota nahin rah saktaa tha phir bhi 1914 main koi america nahin jaanata tha ki unhen yuddh main sanlagn hona padegaa
 When Germany's u-boats started an uncontrolled war, America, the last powerful neutral country against Germany, entered the war
 wilson ne 2 april 1917 ko congress ko apana prasiddh sandesh bheja, jisamen usne apane desh ko salaah di ki yah yuddh main pravesh kare or vishwa ko loktantreey shaktiyon kii raksha kare
 In the said message, he said, "we will definitely fight for the principles we want from the heart
 ham loktantr kii raksha karenge
 We will protect the rights of those who respect a just authority and thus want some rights in their governance by remaining disciplined
 ham sabhi chote deshon or rashtron ke adhikaron or swatantrataaon kii aavashyak raksha karenge
 We would like to ensure that free people throughout the world have just and free freedom, so that peace and security can be maintained in all countries and thus the whole world will be free
 aaj america ke saubhaahgya se vah din aa gaya he jabaki hamaare naagarik apana rakt or apni shakti un siddhanton kii raksharth vyay karenge jinke aadhaar par america kaa janm hua tha, jinke aadhaar par america ko sukh or samruddhi praapt hui thi tathaa vah amuly shaanti praapt hui jise vah atyant mahatv kii drushti se dekhtaa aayaa he
 " shantipriy wilson vivash tha
 It was a matter of great importance for America's future that he had found such a person as President who transformed the basis of this war into a 'noun of salvation and reform'
 17 janvari 1917 ke bhaashan kaa ek ansh uski sampoorn maanavtaa ke prati samvedansheel vichaaron ko abhivyakt karata he-”bina kisi paksh kii vijay ke shaanti, prayek jati ke liye aatm-nirnay kaa siddhanth, samuhik, swatantrata, astr-shastron kaa parisemen, uljhane vaali sandhiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa akraman kii roak ke liye samuhik sangrakshan kii vyavastha
 "on April 2, Wilson appeared in front of the nation's highest representative congress and asked for permission to declare war
 ”is mahaan shantipurna janata ko yuddh kii ore-jo sabase adhik bhayanak or vidhvansak yuddh he
 
taking is a terrible thing
 sabhyataa swayan bhi sankat ke palade main jhul rahi he kintu nyaay shaanti kii apeksha moolyawaan he ore ham aisi vastuon ke liye ladenge jo hamen atyadhik priy rahi hai
 For democracy, for the rights of the people who believe in the rule that they should be heard in their own government, for the rights and freedom of the small nations, for the rule of the world by the organizations that bring peace to all nations and Provide security and finally the world can become independent
 aise hi lok kaary ko apana jivan or apana sarvasv samarpit kar sakate hai
 With the campaign that the day has come, America's placenta blood and power should be spent for the principles that have given her birth and peace, which she has protected, that is, if God is pleased Can't do anything else
 “ After the war, whether Wilson had suffered defeat and whether it was bitterly criticized by nominal realists, his speech was a turning point in American history and politics
 unke hriday se nikalne vaale shabd itane maarmik the ki sara raashtra uski aawaaj par taanaashaahee par prajatantra kii barbarta par sabhyataa kii vijay ke liye yuddh main kud padaa
 In the countries across the seas, he not only appeared as a unique great man, but also came to be recognized as the leader of a powerful nation, who descended to protect a peaceful, pleasant and orderly life in the world
 nevins evam comajor ke shabdon main- ” 'shakti adhikadhik shakti, shakti bina kisi rukaawat yaa seemaa ke' yah vachan rashtradhyaksh wilson ne diya tha or raashtra hathvadita ko thopane main safalataa praapt kii
 Immediately worked to fulfill this promise
 iske purv kii kisi sarkaar ne yuddh main isse adhik budhimaani ore kaaryakshmata nahin dikhalaai thi
 Even before this, the Americans did not show such vigor, resourcefulness and invented intelligence
 “ ‘bina vijay kii shanti’ yuddh kaa naaraa ban gaya tha
 After the cease-fire treaty, Wilson, who did not listen to the advice of his secretary, reached the Paris Peace Conference in December 1918, he was welcomed as the 'messiah of Peace'
 europe main us samay yah bhaavana vidyaman thi ki keval wilson hi aisa vyakti he jo vibhinn rashtron ke raag-dwesh or unki irshyaa-bhaavana se upar uthaa hua evam maanavtaa kaa rakshak he
 Therefore, when this philosopher king took the booklet of his principles in his hand, armed with military power, came to set the terms of the treaty, the people of Europe opened his heart in his honor
 sabhi deshon main uskaa abhootpurv swaagat hua
 When he reached Paris, the French were delighted to see him
 sadakon par apaar jan-samooh ne uski stuti kii or akhabaaron ne uske gungan kiye
 In fact, everyone's eyes were on him
 vijayi nyaay kii, vijit dayaa kii or saamaanya jan-shakti kii aashaa karte the
 Wilson came to this conference as a lamp of peace
 vah nahin chahta tha ki paris sammelan 1815 ke vienna congress jaise nihit swaarthon kaa garh ban jaye
 But he could not guess that the conquering nations had a vestige of selfishness and if he had taken into account other facts, he would have escaped the trap or deception in which he himself got badly entangled due to his idealism
 uske pavitra uddeshy vijeta rashtron kii satta-pipaasa ke aage bhasmasaat ho gayi
 Wilson presented his ideas as the famous 14 sutras
 uske 14 sutron main pratham sutara yahi tha ki shaanti ke samjhaute saarvajanik rup se kiye jaayengen, koi gupt samjhauta nahin hoga
 These principles were also appreciated by the politicians of the Allies
 unke paas yudhottar samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye uparokt siddhanton ke atirikt or kya tha ? or parajeet rashtron ne bhi in siddhanton ke prati apni sahmati prakat kii parantu aadarshon evam siddhanton kii antatah shakti-poojak rashtron ke saamne kuch na chal saki
 The conference was also dominated by nationalist ideas, personal interests, which were predominant in the Vienna Congress
 france kaa klemency or england kaa loyad donon ne hi wilson par apni hathvadita ko thopane main safalataa praapt kii
 RB Mobat wrote in 'european Diplomacy' that "clemenceau used to repeat this sentence in the morning - i will support the establishment of the League of Nations"
 “ kintu italy ke orlando se jab ek baar poocha gaya ki rashtrasang ke bare main aapkaa kya mat he to uttar diya tha ki ”ham nihsandeh rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa swaagat karenge kintu fum kaa prashn tay kiya janaa chaiye
 "wilson was alone in the entire conference
 vienna congress ke pashchaat europe main is prakaar itane vishaal paimaane par vishwa str kaa koi sammelan nahin hua tha
 This former professor of political philosophy at Princeton was a talented orator and idealist thinker
 vah kathor vishwaason kaa vyakti tha jisamen raajnneetik doordarshita to ucch koti kii thi, lekin itani kootnithik yogyata nahin thi ki vah anya pratinidhiyon ko parajeet rashtron ke saath udaar vyavhaar ke liye taiyaar kar sake
 In the words of Stanard Baker, "whoever saw him working, never dared to dare to blasphemy before Wilson or behind his back
" “ wilson kaa yah vishwaas tha ki rashtrasang kii sthapana se hi maanav jati kii raksha ho sakati he, atah vah ise sab shaanti-sandhiyon kaa anivaary ang bananaa chahta tha
 But he was not mentally as sharp as Lloyd George and Clemenceau and relied exclusively on his pre-determined ideas, so he proved to be a novice in the field of diplomacy and political bargaining
 uske adarshavaad or rashtrasang kii sthapana ke atyadhik utsaah kaa duusare deshon ne puraa laabh uthaaya
 For other nations to accept the creation of the League of Nations, Wilson was willing to give up everything, even for the League of Nations he agreed to disregard many of the principles of his 14 sources
 paal bardsal ke kathananusaar vah kshatipurti kii samasya ke atirikt anya sabhi prashnon par britain, france or japan se rashtrasang ke naam par praayah apni adhikansh baaten manwaane main safal hua
 The Chinese state should have been found by the Chinese people on the basis of Wilson's theory of self-determination, but Wilson decided to give it to Japan with the desire to get the support of other superpowers to establish the League of Nations
 yah nirnay swayammev wilson dwaara apane siddhanton par kutharaghaat tha
 Nevertheless, if a little leniency was dealt to the defeated at the Paris Conference, it was because of Wilson
 isamen koi sandeh nahin tha ki yadi wilson sammelan main na hota to loyad jorge or klemenso na jane kya se kya kar dete
 Wilson continued to curb his infinite aspirations
 yadi wilson na hota to france germany kaa namonishaan mitaakar hi dam letaa
 Wilson had two objectives
 pratham nyaaypurna samjhauta jiske anusaar aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth par rashtron kii simaaon kaa nirdhaaran ho taaki paraspar shaanti sthapit ho sake
 Second, the establishment of the League of Nations
 pehle uddeshy main vah safal nahin hua kyonki jo shaanti kii gai vah thopi hui shaanti thi na ki aatm-nirnay ke aadhaar par yaa samjhauta-vaarta kii shaanti
 But he succeeded in the second objective
 rashtron ke sangh kaa vichaar moulik nahin tha or kai deshon main kai logon ne is vichaar ko spasht karne main yogadan diya tha, kintu jis rashtrasang kii antim rup se sthapana kii gai thi vah wilson kii hi sristi thi or uske aadarshon kaa mandir tha
 Some scholars think that Wilson himself made a huge mistake by coming to Paris
 yadi vah washington main rah kar hi american pratinidhiyon ko aadesh detaa rahata to bahut sambhav tha ki uskaa prabhaav adhik vyapak hota, par wilson ko sarvaadhik chintaa rashtrasang kii thi or uski abhilaashaa thi ki vishwa sanstha ke vidhaan kaa nirmaan vah swayan kare
 In fact, it was very unfortunate that while his presence at the conference was not beneficial to the conference itself, he could not even keep contact with the American public while away from his country, which resulted in the United Nations being nurtured by his own country
 Only rejected
 american seenet ne wilson ke rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke prastaav ko nahin mana
 In the 1918 congressional elections, the anti-wilson Republican Party won a majority in both houses of Congress, and the Senate revoked the League's consent to accept the Treaty of Legislature and Versailles
 yah maanavtaa ke ek mahaan paigambar kaa dukhamay paraabhav tha
 Woodrow Wilson believed that public administration should separate from politics
 unhen saamaanya taur par prashasan or raajnneeti main vibhaajan ko rekhaankit karne ke kaaran yaad kiya jaataa he
 According to Wilson, the composition of a constitution is easy but it is difficult to implement it
 unhone kriyanvayan ke kshetra ke adhyayan par vishesh bal diya
 In his essay Study of Administration, Wilson, while discussing the interrelationships of politics and administration, wrote that administration is outside the domain of politics
 prashasnic samasyaayen raajnneetik samasyaayen nahin hoti hai
 Although politics can determine the function and nature of administration, it should not be given the right to manipulate administrative aspects
 prashasan ko raajnneeti se swatantra karte hue woodro wilson ne use ek vishay ke rup main sthapit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai

 raajnneeti praveshdwar The constitution of the United Kingdom refers to the set of laws and principles under which the United Kingdom is governed
 anya deshon ke samvidhan purnatah likhit rup main hai kintu euke kaa koi mul sanvaidhanik dastavej nahin he
 That is why it is often said that the UK constitution is unwritten, encoded
 kintu 'alikhit' shabd praayah bhraamak he kyonki britani samvidhan kaa adhikansh bhaag vibhinn roopon main likhit rup main he
 @sureshpatelsa british samvidhan kii visheshtaayen : The British Constitution is called the "mother of constitutions" because the oldest constitution served as a guide for all subsequent constitutions
 vedh rajtantr vaadi britain main hi aadhunik vishwa kii pehali prajatantric shashan pranali astitv main aayi 
 Despite the monarchy in Britain, which was inspired by oligarchy, democratic institutions and representative rule developed and the unwritten British constitution was affected by monarchy, oligarchy and democracy
 british samvidhan kii visheshtaon ko in sandarbhon main hi nimnanusaar samajha ja saktaa hai: 1
 Unwritten Constitution: vishwa ke vibhinn pragatisheel deshon ke samvidhan jahaan likhit he, british samvidhan alikhit he 
 Not only this, most of the rules of government work, etc
 are also unwritten
 vastutah british samvidhan kaa vikaas kramik rup se anya sansthaaon ke vikaas ke saath hua or use kabhi lekhabaddh nahin kiya gaya kyonki uski jarurat unhen mahasoos nahin hui 
 The main reason behind this is his practical and clear thinking
 vidhi ke shashan kaa pratik britain bina likhit samvidhan ke is pratik ko banaaye hue he, yah vilakshan visheshta he 
 But it is also a fact that in the form of written judicial decisions, parliamentary acts and mandates, the constitution has also been partially authored
 aisa samvidhan ko likhit swaroop dene ke uddeshy se nahin hua he 
 This is why the British Constitution is an unwritten document
 2
 paramparaagat rup se kramik vikaas: The British constitution was not made by sitting in one place in a day or in a year
 iskaa vikaas paanchavin sadi se lekar aaj tak nirantar rup se hua or ho rahaa he 
 Most of the basic principles or logic of this constitution are based on traditions
 je
es
mil ne in paramparaon ko ”samvidhan ke alikhit nitiwachan” kii sangya di he 
 Although these traditions are not enforceable by the court, they are still humane and nurturing in the system of governance there
 unka mahatv isi baat main he ki unke bina british raaj vyavastha kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati 
 like: taj kaa mantrimandal ke paraamarsh se kaam karnaa 
 Appointing the leader of the majority party of the House of Representatives as the Prime Minister by the Taj
 jan pratinidhi sadan ke prati mantrimandal kaa samuhik or vyactik uttardaayitv 
 Approval by Parliament by Parliament Acts
 pradhanmantri kii salaah par janpratinidhi sadan kii taj dwaara samaapti 
 Governance to be accountable to the people
 apni pustak ”thots on da constitution” main el
 es
 emry kehete hai ki ”british samvidhan kanoon, purvavartita tathaa parampara kaa mishran he 
 " 3
 siddhant evam vyavhaar main antar: In Britain, the unwritten principles of the Constitution are prevalent but there are some differences in practice
 jaise: Britain considers the rule of law to be the last, but the prevalence of administrative law is increasing there
 vahaan siddhanthata sansadeey prajatantr he lekin naam maatr kii karypalika nirvaachit nahin vanshanugat he taj 
 According to Monroe, "one of the unique features of the British Constitution is that it is not what it looks like and does not look like it is
" ” 4
 Parliamentary democracy: prajatantr kaa sansadeey swaroop britain kii dein he 
 In the British parliamentary system: dohari karypalika he- taj ke rup main naam maatr kii karypalika or mantriparishad ke rup main vaastavik karypalika 
 Taj is the head of state while the Council of Ministers is the head of government
 yahaan vidhayika se sarkaar nikalati he arthath mantriparishad or vidhayika main sajaateey sambandh hai 
 The people's representative forms the majority government in the House
 or sarkaar isi sadan ke prati uttaradaayi hoti he 
 This responsibility is both collective of ministers and individual ministers
 pradhanmantri kii salaah par taj nimna sadan ko bhang kar saktaa he 
 Britain has a unique republic
 kyonki is loktantric desh main vaid rajtantr maujuud he 
 The crown is not elected and is a hereditary position
 taj jis vyakti ke sar par rakh diya jaataa he, vah raja ban jaataa he 
 This fire is therefore called this "muktadhari" Republic
 5
 sansadeey sarvocchata: The basis of British polity is the principle of parliamentary supremacy
 isse aashay he ki: Parliament has the ultimate right to make, amend or repeal any law
 de lolme kehete hai- ”british sansad kisi aurat ko aadmi or aadmi ko aurat se badalane ke sivaa kuch bhi kar sakati he 
 " british sansad ek hi saamaanya prakriya se saamaanya yaa vishisht yaa sanvaidhanik kanoon banaati he 
 British laws cannot be challenged in court
 taj ko sansadeey kanoonon par hastakshar karne hi hote hai 
 Bezhot writes: "if both the houses of Parliament pass his death order and send it to him, then we will have to sign it too
 ” 6
 Method of salmon: britain vidhi ke shashan ke liye vishwa vikhyath he kyonki vidhi ke shashan kii na sirf yaheen se shuruuaat hui apitu apane shreshthatam arth main vah britain main hi lagu he 
 Rule of law means - supremacy of common law
 diasi ne ”di laa of costitution” main vidhi ke shashan ke teen arth bataaye hai: Supremacy of common law: desh main saamaanya kanoon hi sarvocch he, jis par kisi swechhachari shakti kaa prabhaav nahin he 
 Each person is governed only by law
 kanoon ke samaksh samanta: All persons are equal before the law irrespective of their social, economic, political status
 sabake liye ek hi kanoon he 
 The Constitution itself is the result of law: england main naagarik adhikaron kaa strot saamaanya kanoon he jo nyaayik nirnyon ke dwaara lagu he 
 Legislation itself has evolved as a result of these decisions-laws
 7
 lachilaapan: The Constitution of Britain is lax in nature and can be easily amended
 vahaan saamaanya kanoon or sanvaidhanik kanoon main antar nahin kiya jaataa arthath sanshodhan usee saamaanya sansadeey prakriya se ho jate hai jisase saamaanya kanoon banaaye jate hai 
 8
 Unitary Constitution: british samvidhan ekahara samvidhan he 
 It is not only one for the whole of Great Britain, but it also ensures a single citizenship, a single law, etc
 9
 naagarik adhikaar: The British constitution provides many rights to citizens such as the freedom of the body, freedom of assembly, freedom of arms, freedom of expression, etc
 10
 ekaatmak rajya: The British constitution declares the whole of Britain as a "unitary state" in place of the Union
 isamen sampurna shakti centre sarkaar main nihit maani jaati he or vah apni shashan suvidha ke liye kshetreey ikaiyaan, sthaneey sarkaar aadi kaa gathan or vighatan kar sakati he 
 11
 two-party Political System: britain ne sansadeey prajatantr ko apanaate hue bhi bahudaleey ke sthaan par dwi-daleey vyavastha ko apanaaya he 
 Here two parties named Anudar Dal and Mazdoor Dal exist
 12
 samvidhan ke poorak adhinium: Despite the absence of a written constitution in Britain, there are acts that have constitutional significance, such as the Hebius Coppers Act State of Westminster, the Ministers of Crown Act, the People's Representation Act, etc

 The x ray used in the hospital includes neutron, gamma ray, proton, neutrino, as well as positron
 pozitron kaa prayogtmak avishkaar 1932 i
 main hua
 Andersen observed that by applying magnetic fields in the Wilson cell, taking photos of space rays, two paths, such as electrons, often have their curvature in opposite directions
 vakrata kan ke aavesh par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore it is clear from these experiments that the charge of these particles will be inverted
 ab pozitron kaa astitv anya pareekshanon se bhi sthapit ho chukaa he
 Four years before Positron's experimental invention, Dirac gave an equation that described all the known properties of the electron, but it was also necessary to assume a particle whose covariance and energy were negative
 yah baat ajeeb thi
 To avoid this undesirable situation, Dirac proposed that generally all states of negative energy are filled with electrons
 at: ham dhanatmak urja kii avasthaaon ko hi dekh pate hai
 But sometimes when strong, interactions occur by the electromagnetic field, an electron comes out of the states of negative energy and comes out and behaves like a positive energy electron
 par saath hi rin urjawali ek avasthaa khaali ho jaati he
 We can illustrate this with a hole in a sea of negative energy
 yah chhidr aise hi aacharan karata he jaise dhan aveshwala kan, jisaki sanhati electron ke baraabar ho
 At first Dirac tried to consider this particle to be a proton, but when Andersen's result was discovered, he considered the particle not a proton, but a positron
 dirack kaa chhidr siddhant bahut santoshjanak nahin he
 The modern theory of electrons and positrons relies on the second quantization of the Dirac equation
 isamen pozitron ke gundharm prakritik vidhi se nikal aate hai
 Electrons and positrons can be called 'particles' and 'antimatter'
