 In bilingual justice, the separate existence of the two has been considered by considering two distinctions as "matter" and matter
 "vishayi" main rup, vednaa, sangya, sanskaar or vigyaan in paanch skandhon kaa; chakshu aadi chha: indriyon tathaa rup aadi inke chha: vishyon, in baarah aaytanon kaa tathaa indriya, vishay or vigyaan in teen dhaatuon kaa samavesh hota he
 The "subject" consists of representational religions for these four "sanskrit" forms of Rupadharma, Chittadharma, Chaitadharma and Rupacittaviprayuktharma

 For specific information about Vaibhashika justice, one should visit the texts of Buddhist scholars like Katyayaniputra, Vasubandhu, Sthyamati, Dinang, Yashomitra and Sangabhadra
 "sautrantik nyaay" main buddha ke sutratmak vachanon ke yathashrut arth ko vishesh mahatv diya jaataa he
 Its substance is the same as Kalpana Vaibhashika, the only difference being that both "knowable" and "knowledge" are considered direct in Vaibhashika justice, and knowledge in Saturnic justice is considered direct and knowable is imperceptible and enlightening

 There are two proofs in Buddhist justice - direct and presumption
 pratyaksh ke do bhed hai -nirviklpak or saviklpak
 The "alternative" is the direct evidence of their being a subscriber to the subscriber
 "saviklpak jati" aadi kalpit padaarthon kaa graahak hone ke kaaran apramaan hi he
 The area of coverage in Buddhist justice is considered limited compared to Vedic justice
 uske anusaar tadutpatti or tatadatmya hi vyapti ke upjivy hai
 That is, only those substances which have mutual working sense or identity, they have wide-ranging sense
 buddha nyaay main nyaay ke do hi avyav maane gaye hai- udhaaharan or upanay
 It is from this elemental justice that the universality principle has been established by means of momentariness, scientific metaphysics, Pudgalanratmya and Dharmanatramya etc
 buddha nyaay main arthkriyaakaaritv ko ""satta"" kaa lakshan maanakar tathaa sthir padaarth main use asambhav kahkar bhavatmak padaarthon ko kshanik mana gaya he
 In Buddhist justice, it is considered necessary for one to be endowed with three titular forms in order to be saddhatu
 ve teen rup pakshasatv, sapakshasatv evam vipakshsatv hai
 Accepted in Gouthami justice, "non-discriminatory" and "unconstrained" have been called unnecessary

 garib family ke shahid kaa kasoor kya tha, iskaa pataa to khud use or uske parivaar tak ko nahin tha
 Shahid met War Saab after going to jail after suffering torture in police custody
 war saab se milane ke baad shahid ko mahasoos hua ki begunaah hone ke baavjood jail main band akelaa vahi nahin he
 There are hundreds more like him, who have been kept in jail by the police after giving third degree torture only on suspicion

 Powada is a famous folk singing of Maharashtra
 mukhyatah yah shivaji maharaj ke yuddh kaushal kaa yashogaan tathaa stuti he
 Powada is the singing and writing type of Veer Ras which is popular in Maharashtra
 mul rup se dalit samudaayon dwaara gaaye jane vaale gaathagiton kii is vidha ne shivaji maharaj ko yuddh ladane ke liye prerit kiya
 Poovada means to sing in the ancient Marathi language
 marathi main powada gane waalon ko shaahir kaha jaataa he
 The term Shahir is as old as Marathi culture
 shaahir sahitya ko marathi kavitaaon kaa udaykaal kaha jaataa he
 This is the type of song that gives a feeling to Marathi speakers
 bharat main iskaa udai 17ve shatabdhi main hua
 In this, the song is composed by putting a historical event in front
 is geet prakaar kii rachana karanevaale geetkaaron ko shaahir kahaan jaataa he
 During this time, the singers who have done this business are called Gondhali
 powada marathi sahitya kii ek pramukh vidha he powada jise gondhal dalit jati ke log gaate the par aage chalakar, shivaji ke baad, sabhi jatiyon ke logon ne ise apana liya
 The description of wars was the main subject of the Powada singers, which they used to describe very vividly and vigorously, that was a period of internal conflicts and external invasions
 atah apane ashrayadaataaon ko unki puri takat se yuddh ladane ke liye prerit karnaa, us kaal ke kavi kaa pramukh kartavya-sa ban gaya tha
 But Mahatma Phule used Powada for public awakening
 In the days of freedom struggle and after independence, Powada became the song of national movement and people's movements respectively
 powada ko samakaleen maratha itihaas kaa vishwasaneey sakshi mana gaya he
 Although the history of Powara starts from the 17th century, but before the coronation of Shivaji, in the Yadav period, the devotional songs sung in Dnyaneshwari were a form of Powara itself
 shivaji maharaj ke kaal main clasik powada ke beej boe gaye
 The tradition of Shahir literature began in the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 shivaji ke kaal main pratham powada ‘afjal khana vadh’ 1659 main agnidas dwaara gaaya gaya, jisamen shivaji dwaara afjal khan ke vadh kaa varnan kiya gaya tha
 It is recorded in the Gazette of Maharashtra
 doosraa mahatvapurn powada tha tanaji malsure dwaara singhgarh par kabja karne ke bare main, jise tulsidas ne gaya
 Equally important is the Powada sung by Yamaji Bhaskar about Baji Pasalkar
 shivaji ke anek powada gaae gaye jaise shivaji avtari purush, shiv pratigya, pratapgarcha ransangram, shahistakhan chaa paraabhav, shivaji maharaj powada, chhatrapati rajmata jijabai, shivaranye punya samaran, singhgarh, shivarajbhishek, samaajawaadee shiv chhatrapati, shiv-gaurav, shivadarshan, purogami shivaji, shivasambhav, shivakavy ityadi
 After the Shivaji period, the Peshwakal singer was Ramjoshi
 anantfadi, honaji bala va prabhakar ne bhi kai powada gaae
 Later, this art lagged behind, but as folk art, Powada continued to play a role in the development of Marathi literature
 mahatma jotiba phule ne chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii samadhi dhund nikaali or 1869 main unhone puna main pehali baar shivaji maharaj kii jayanti manaai
 He got Shivaji's tomb repaired and wrote his first book 'A Ballad on Shivaji', which was recorded by the British
 phule ko yah ahsaas tha ki itihaas ke sakshi ke rup main powada kaa bahut mahatv he
 Being both lyrical and prose, both entertainment and publicity are possible through Powada
 phule ne ashikshit janata ko powada ke madhyam se shivaji ke kaaryon ke bare main bataaya
 unhone maatr vyakti-aadhaarit powada nahin likhe balki upama dekar likhaa
 shivaji ke kaaryon se prerana lene ke liye unke bare main saral powada ke madhyam se ashikshit janata ko jaankaree dete the
 Later many povadas were also written against the British Raj
 yah bhi bade aashcharya kii baat he ki britishon ne hi powada ko sangrahit karne kaa kaam bhi kiya
 The biggest example is that of Harry Arbuthnot Akworth
 unhone shankar tukaraam shaaligram ke saath milakar kareeb 60 powada ikattha kiye, jinhen 1891 main ‘itihaas prasiddh purushanchi vaa striyaanche powada’ naam se prakashit kiya gaya
 After that, Akworth wrote a book called 'ballad of Maratha' in 1894
 angrejon ne shahu maharaj ke samay ke 5-6 powada khoje, 150 powada peshwa ke samay ke tathaa british kaal ke 150 powada mili
 By 1947, the British had collected more than a thousand Powars
 kai shahiron ke naam pataa nahin chale
 Dr
 SP Goswami published the initial Powaras, including Rao Barve Gyanprakash's Powaras
 in powada main british raaj ke khilaaf aakrosh prakat hua tha
 Yashwant Narasimha Kelkar published Powara in three parts, which helped to advance the Powada genre
 gondhal jati ne maharashtra ke itihaas ko bachaaya to powada ko sankalit va prakashit kar is maukhik parampara ko vilupt hone se bachaaya gaya
 Shahir literature produced many great writers including Shripad Mahadev Verde, MV Dhondh and others
 varde ne kai powada ekatrit kar unhen ‘vividhvaarta’ naam se prakashit kiya
 He also wrote a book titled 'marathi Kavitacha Ushakal Kinwa Marathi Sahitya'
 em en sahastrabuddhe kaa ‘marathi shahiri- vaganmay’ 1950 ke dashak main mumbai marathi sahitya sangh ne prakashit kiya
 All these authors played a very important role by collecting and publishing Powara
 1956 main sanyukt maharasht andolan main bhartiya communist party ne shaahir amar shaikh anna bhaau saathe tathaa gavankar ko janm diya
 All these shahiras used Powara to highlight the wrong policies and decisions of the government
 yah nae prakaar ke krantikari powada the, jo janajagriti paidaa kar rahe the
 These Powars were neither religious nor monarchical, but they were bringing out the demands of the people
 ye mazdooron kii samasyayon va akaal kaa chithran the, ve garibon kii jubaan the
 He was depicting social problems of modern times
 shaahir samaaj main vyaapt shoshan, anyaay va atyaachaar ke bare main powada ga rahe the
 Now Powada was no longer merely a description of history, but was connected to the problems of ordinary people

 In the 1980s, Vilas Ghogre and G
 Sambhaji Bhagat carried forward the tradition of Annabhau Sathe and Amar Sheikh of Maharashtra

 One objective of accounting is to easily determine what the trader has to give to his creditors, what he has to take from his debtors, his expenses and income etc
 yah bhi spasht he ki yah jaankaree keval rojnaama main saudon ke likhane maatr se hi turant praapt nahin ho sakati
 Suppose a person wants to know what to take or give from 'A', then he will have to see the entire scroll to find the entries related to 'A', because he has bought the goods from him many times and has given him money many times
 
 yadi yahi tarika apane saath vyavhaar karne vaale prayek vyakti yaa form ke saath apni sthiti maaloom karne ke liye prayog main laayaa jaay to vahi khate likhane kaa uddeshy antashah hi praapt hoga
 Apart from this, it will mean wasteful time, energy and money
 atah prayek vyakti athwa form se sambandhit sabhi pravishtiyon ko ek saath likhane ke liye koi twarit saadhan praapt karnaa chahie
 All this is done by collating and collating the entries in another book, called Khatabahi
 prayek vyakti se sambandhit un sabhi pravishtiyon ko jo ab tak rojnaama main vikhri padi thi ek jagah ekatrit evam sankshipt kiya jaataa he
 According to Batleboy, Khatabahi is the main book of accounts and in this book all the business transactions are divided in the end and get a place in their accounts
 picals ke anusaar, ‘khatabahi khaaton kii sabase mahatvapurn pusatak he or sahaayak pustakon main kii gai pravishtiyon kii manzil he
 It is essentially a collection of three types of accounts - real, personal and nominal
 uparyukt vivechan se yah puri tarah se spasht ho jaataa he ki khaataavhi pratham pravishti kii pustak nahin he kyonki koi bhi pravishti sidhi is prastak main nahin kii jaati he
 The entry is first made in the supporting books
 yah pramukh mahatva kii pusatak he
 In this, there are accounts related to all the transactions in the transaction
 yadhyapi aisa koi pakkaa niyam nahin he tathaapi saadharantaya khatabahi ke ek prishth main ek hi khaataa hota he
 This is done to remove impurities and clumsiness of the entire handwriting
 yadi khaaton kii sankhya bahut adhik ho to ek hi khatabahi main sab khaaton ko rakhana sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 In such a situation the book is divided into several departments or results
 udhaaharan ke liye rokad bahi khatabahi kaa hi ek upavibhaajan hai
 Cash deals are written in it
 khatabahi ko vibhajit karne kaa ek-tarika use vyaktig or avyaktigat yaa saadhaaran khatabahi main vibhajit karnaa he
 The individual ledger can be further subdivided into the ledger ledger account
 isi prakaar se khatabahi ko bhi vaastavik khatabahi or naam maatr khatabahi main upavibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes a personal account is maintained to maintain a capital account and a withdrawal account
 parantu company main aisi koi khatabahi nahin rakhi jaati he
 It should be noted that the above method is not the only one to subdivide the account
 vibhajit karne kii vidhiyaan prayek ke ke halaat par nirbhar karti he
 Each account is suggestive at the beginning
 saamanyata yah varnatmak abhisuchak hota he
 a page of the suffixer is assigned to a letter in the alphabet and the names that begin with it are written on the page assigned to that letter
 abhisuchak main prayek khate ke saamne khatabahi ke us prishth kii sankhya likh di jaati he jis par vah khaataa kholaa gaya he
 Many forms of ledger are found in business
 sarvasaamaanya praaroop main tithi, saude kaa vivaran, prishthank or dhanrashi ke liye stambh hote hai
 Additional cubic columns can be added to suit business needs
 praaroop kaa ek vaikalpik rup, jise bainko or kuch vyavsaayik sansthaaon me apaana jaataa he, vah he jiske khatabahi ke puure prishth ko chah stambhon main baant diya jaataa he
 These columns are - is vaikalpik praaroop kaa laabh yah he ki prayek saude ke uparant khate kaa shesh apane aap nikaala ja saktaa he shesh gyaat karne ke liye varsh kii samaapti tak pratiksha nahin kerani padati hai
 The process of making entries in the ledger from the booklet and other supporting books is called Khatauni
 rojnaama evam anya sahaayak pustakon main di gai pravishtiyon ke liye aadhaar banaati he
 Khatauni work does not require special skill as it is a normal type of work
 pravishtiyon ke rojnaama main likhane ke pashchaat khatabahi main khataya janaa chahie
 It is easier than the lettering of the journalists than the letter of the other supporting books
 rojnaama ke debit paksh ke dhan-raashi stambh main likhi gai dhanrashi ko khatabahi main sambandhit khate ke credit paksh me khataya jaataa he or credit paksh ke dhan-raashi stambh main likhi gai dhanrashi ko khatabahi main sambandhit khate ke credit paksh main khataya jaataa he
 Names of accounts are exchanged in the statement column of the ledger - the name of the account in which the money is debited
 khatabahi main duusare khate ke credit paksh ke vivaran stambh main likhaa jayega
 Similarly, the opposite is also true
 yah nimnlikhit udhaaharan dwaara samajha ja saktaa he
 a separate account of each creditor is opened in the ledger
 prayek kray kii dhan-raashi usase sambandhit vyaktigat khate main saadharantaya pratidin credit kii jaaegi
 The double-entry of this book will be completed by debiting the purchase account of the total purchases over a periodic sum
 khaataa pustak main prayek dendar kaa ek alag khaataa kholana hoga
 Generally, credit sales are maintained daily in individual accounts
 graahakon ke vaiyakti khate ko vikray kii dhanrashi se debit kiya jayega
 The sales account will be credited with the monthly sum of credit sales
 is prakaar is pustak kii dwi-pravishti purna kii jaaegi
 In Khatabhi every person to whom the goods have been returned is debited and at the end of the month the periodical sum of the returns is credited to the purchase return account in the ledger
 us prayek graahak ko jo maal lautaata he, credit kiya jaataa he or maheene ke ant main vikray-vaapasi pustak ke yoga ke vikray-vaapasi khate ko debit kiya jaataa he
 All the cash items are consumed in the ledger in the ledger
 rokad bahi ke debit paksh main likhi sabhi praptiyon ko sambandhit khaaton ke credit main ‘rokad se’, bank se’, ‘chhot se’ likhakar khataya jaataa he
 All payments written on the credit side of the cash book are debited to the respective accounts debit by writing 'from cash', 'with discount', from bank '
 rokad bahi ke debit paksh ke chhot satmbh ke yoga ko khatabahi main chhot khate ke debit paksh main likhaa jaataa he
 Because items are sourced on the credit side of individual accounts
 madon ko vyaktigat khaaton ke debit main khatai jane kii vajah se rokad bahi ke credit paksh ke chhot stambh ke yoga ko khatabahi main chhot khate ke credit paksh main likhaa jaataa he
 The account of the person from whom the exchange is received is credited with the money amount of the bill
 praapt vipatron ke masik yoga se khatabahi main prapya-vinimay-vipatr khaataa debit kiya jaataa he
 The account of the person to whom the bill is given is debited from the money amount of the bill

 The following were the reasons for the American Civil War- sanyukt rajya america ke uttari rajyon kii sthiti jananaankeey evam aarthik drushti se apekshaakrit majboot thi
 Out of the 34 states of the Union, 23 states were included in the north and 2 / 3 of the total population of the country lived in the north, with a very small number of slaves

 In industries, cotton, woolen garments, leather goods etc
 were produced on a large scale
 in kaarkaanon main mazdooron dwaara mashiinon se utpaadan hota tha, atah yahaan gulaamon evam daason kaa vishesh mahatv nahin tha
 On the other hand, the economic life of the southern states of America was based on agriculture and there was not much use of machines in agriculture
 atah in rajyon ke kisaan kheti ke liye gulaamon ke shram par nirbhar the
 In the south, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco were cultivated on a large scale in which slaves worked as laborers
 atah dakshin kaa samaaj purna rup se daason par nirbhar tha
 In this way, the southern state was distinguished from the northern and western parts due to its characteristics, the prevalent slave system and plantation system prevalent there

 In the southern states, the issue of slavery was always sensitive
 jab kabhi anya rajyon me das pratha par lage pratibandh ko in dakshini, rajyon main lagu karne kii uthi to in rajyon ne ise apni prabhusatta par akraman mana
 In fact, slavery was seen as a stigma on humanity in the northern states and the demand to abolish it was raised
 samachar-patron main madhyam se is das virdohi bhaavana ko ubhaara gaya
 On the other hand the issue of slaves for the southern states was linked to profitability
 unka tark tha ki das pratha main shramik sanghathanon, hadataalon aadi kaa bhay nahin tha tathaa uttari rajyon ke mazdooron kii tulana main ve daason ko adhik suvidha pradaan karte hai
 On the basis of this mindset and arguments, the southern states considered slavery to be necessary

 This boundary line was called the "mesum-dixon" boundary
 ab america kaa pashchimi kshetron main vistaar ho rahaa tha or nae-nae kshetra sanyukt rajya america main shaamil kiye ja rahe the
 In such a situation a question arose whether these states should be included as a slave state or as an independent state

 The dispute deepened over the merger of the state of Missouri

 Texas eventually joined the Union in 1845 as a slave state

 In 1860, the Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won and in 1861 he assumed the position of President
 republican party ne das pratha kii aalochana kii thi or yah party swatantra shram vichaardhaara main vishwaas rakhti thi
 Lincoln's victory, therefore, seemed inauspicious to the southern states
 unhen laga ki yah jeet dakshin ke aarthik hiton ke anukool nahin he
 So the first reaction in the southern states was made by the state of Carolina and it announced its separation from the Union
 farvari, 1861 tak mississippi, florida, albama, georgia, lulasiana va texas ne bhi sangh se viched kar jeffrasan davis ko apana raashtrapati niyukt kiya or isi ke saath grihayuddh kii shuruuaat ho gai, jab dakshini carolina se sumter ke kile par bam phenk sangh ke viruddh yuddh ched diya
 The separation of the Union by the Southern States raised an important constitutional question whether the Southern States had the right to secede from the Union? Lincoln, after his election to the presidency, declared unequivocally that the union that was established as the United States of America was unbroken and eternal, that its indefensibility would not be allowed to be destroyed in any way
 america samvidhan nirmaataaon ne kisi rajya ko sangh se pruthak hone kaa adhikaar nahin diya he
 Lincoln declared that "if we can save the union by freeing all slaves, we will do so if we can save the union without freeing slaves, and we will do so if by freeing some slaves and not freeing others If we can save the union, we will do that too
 " is tarah linkan ne sangh ko bachaae rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 During the war, it did not allow the southern states to have relations with foreign countries through diplomatic skill
 usne senaaon ko sangathit kar dakshin ke sashastr sangharsh kii chunauti ko todaa
 From the very beginning, he said that the main goal of the armies was not to take authority over the southern region, but to expand the armies of the Confederation
 1861 i
 main linkan ne das vyavastha kaa unmoolan kar diya or unhen rashtriya senaaon main sammilit hone ke liye aamantrit kiya
 But its purpose was not to destroy the southern states but to maintain the Union
 uskaa maananaa tha ki daason kii swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa se dakshin ke rajyon main daason kaa vidroh hoga or yuddh main unhen daason kii sahaayta nahin mil paaegi
 Finally, through the efforts and diplomacy of Lincoln, the northern states were conquered, and with this the civil war ended in 1865 AD
 linkan ne america kaa yatharth rup main sanyukt rashtriya nirmaan kiya
 Abolished slavery, rejuvenated society and strengthened the American political system
 parantu grihayuddh ke pashchaat america ko vah aage nahin badha sakaa kyonki raajnneetik tantra ko majboot banaaya
 But after the Civil War he could not advance America because he was assassinated on 15 April 1865 by John Viscus Booth
 sanyukt rajya america ke itihaas main america grihayuddh ne ek pradhan mode kaa kaary kiya
 Although there was a huge loss of life and property during the war, a sense of mutual hatred, economic chaos ensued, hurting the lifestyle of the southern states

 In this context, Prof
 Elson stated that "the war was a surgery that, despite being painful, became untold blessing for the United States
" " The civil war brought dramatic changes in national and regional power relations

 They were rejoined in the Union after the surrender of the southern states
 iskaa taatpary tha ki rajyon kaa sangh purvavat bana rahegaa or bhavishya main phir kabhi algaavvaad ke adhikaar kii baat nahin uthegi
 In fact, the outcome of the civil war resolved the constitutional question that states do not have the right to secede from the Union

 As a result, corruption increased and in some parts the moral standard of the society fell
 grihayuddh ko america main ek pramukh audyogic raashtra bana dene vaali saamaajik-aarthik utperrak shakti ke rup main dekha gaya
 In this context, Charles and Manny Beard called this civil war as America's 'second revolution'

 ve kahati hai ki purush ne nari ke chaaro ore jhuthe niyam ore kaanoon banaakar unhen is aashwashan main rakhaa hai ki unki jagah purush shreshth hai
 The writer believed that by doing this, the men had lost their understanding of the problems of the women and their false frauds have helped them to keep the women bound under them in the society
 beovoir kaa maananaa hai ki aisa hi dabaav samaj ke dusre bhaago main bhi dekha gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye, samaaj main rang, jaati, evam dharman ko lekar kattar va choti soch vaale paakhandee logon ne kai jhagade va bhed-bhav felaaya he
 But they believe that as much as Sastri caste has been suppressed in the history of society, no religion and caste has been suppressed
 nari ko apane se neeche rakhkar paakhandee purushon na samaaj main apana ooncha sthaan banaaye rakhaa hai
 In his book Beauvoir has highlighted many such ideas, which challenge the rules or rules of society
 unhone kaha hai ki striyon ko kamazor evam shaareerik va maansik rup se asaamaanya mana gaya he or isi karanvash striyon ko kahi bhi uchit avasar nahin mila hai
 Women have always been assured that they are weak and they should follow the guidance of men to remain stable and normal
 da second sex ke prakashit hone se pehle nari astitvvaad ke vishay main france main kabhi koi bhi vichaar vimarsh nahin hue the or striyon ko kabhi bhi samaaj ke kanoonon se koi shikaayat nahin thim
 But Boar changed the mind
 unka nari va purusjh jaati kii samaaj main samanta do muddon kii taraf dhyaan khinchataa hai: ek, ki kis tarah shaareerik asaamanyata purushon ko nari se upar va badhkar hone kaa kaaran ban gayi hai
 The second is how debating and thinking about physical abnormalities shows that physical abnormality is actually an action of nature and men have no hand in it
 atah, shaareerik asaamanyata ko purusho ore nari main saamaajik asamaanyata karne kaa kaaran vyarth evam murkh hai
 Here Beauvoir denies Plato's idea that a person's gender is an event that does not insist on that person
 isliye, purusho or naario main koi bhed bhav nahin karnaa chahie
 Beauvoir has made many contributions to women's existence, but Beauvoir has never called herself a staunch feminist rightist
 parantu 1960 or 1970 ke stri adhikaaravaadi morcho ke baad 1972 main beovoir na apane aap ko ek stri adhikaaravaadi ghoshit kiya tha

 Nomination Process: saiddhanthik drushti se 'anuwaad kaise hota he' kaa nirvaiyaktik vivaran hi anuwaad kii prakriya he 
 Explanation of the translation process as a specific mode of language practice requires a vision that balances the extraterritorial situations related to translation work and the inter-conditional conditions related to language structure and language use
 uparyukt paristhitiyon se sambandhit saiddhanthik praroopon ke sandarbh main yah spashtikaran prastut karnaa aadhunik anuwaad siddhanth kaa vaishishty mana jaataa he 
 Accordingly, the unit of translation as a part of thinking, the reader of translation, and in terms of art, skill and science, a look at the nature of the translation is accompanied by a detailed description of the process of translation
 saamanytah sandesh kaa anuwaad kiya jaataa he : atah anuwaad kii ikai bhi sandesh ko mana jaataa he
 In different types of translations, the size of the expressive linguistic unit of the message also varies
 yantrik anuwaad main ek rup yaa pad anuwaad kii ikai hota he, parantu maanav anuwaad main ikai kaa aakaar adhik vishaal hota he 
 Similarly, in Ashu oral translation, this unit is a sentence, so in written translation the unit size is larger than the sentence
 likhit madhyam ke maanav anuwaad main, anuwaad kii ikai ek paath ko mana jaataa he 
 Translators translate text-level messages
 paath ke aakaar kii seemaa ek vaakya se lekar ek sampoorn pustak yaa pustakon ke ek vishisht samooh paryant kuch bhi ho sakati he, parantu ek sandesh usamen apni purnataa main abhivyakt ho jaataa ho ye aavashyak he
 For example, a single sentence of a public notice or instruction can become a complete message
 jaise 'pravesh varjit' he
 On the other hand, the entire book of 'rangbhoomi' or 'kamayani' can be of text level
 bhautik suvidha kii drushti se anuvadak paath ko tarksangat khandon main baantkar anuwaad kaary karte hai, aise khandon ko anuvadak paathansh kah sakate hai athwa taatkaalik sandarbh main unhen hi paath bhi kaha jaataa he
 These translators are called the immediate unit of translation and the entire text is the complete unit of translation
 paath kii sanrachana kaa gyaan, anuwaad prakriya ko samajhane main vishesh sahaayak mana jaataa he 
 Three dimensions of text structure are considered - textual, textual and other textual
 sanketavigyaan kii manyata ke anusaar teenon kaa samakalik astitv hota he tathaa ye teenon anyonyashrith hote hai 
 The textual dimension is the internal dimension of the text, in which its language aspect is captured
 donon hi sthitiyon main sugathanaatmakataa paath kaa aantarik gun he
 The textual structure of a text has two sides - vaakya ke antargat aane vaali ikaayiyon kaa adhikram, Experiences at different levels of language analysis
 vaakya kii ikaiyaan, vaakya, upvakya, padabandh, pad or rup is adhikram main sanyojit hoti hai, parantu paath kii drushti se yah baat mahatvapurn he ki ek se adhik vaakyon vaale paath ke vaakya antaravakyayojakon dwaara is prakaar samanvit hote hai ki, puure paath main sansakti kaa gun anubhav hone lagata he 
 But co-operation readiness is not limited
 use ham paath vishleshan ke vibhinn staron par bhi anubhav kar sakate hai 
 Accordingly, contextual cohesion, lexical co-operation, and grammatical co-operation are talked about
 pathshavarti aayam main paath kii vishaywastu, uski vishisht vidha, uskaa saamaajik-saanskrithik paksh, paath ke samay yaa lekhak kaa abhivyaktiparak vishisht aashay, uddisht pathak kaa saamaajik vyaktitv or uski aavashyaktaa aadi kaa antarbhaav hota he 
 The above mentioned aspects of the recursive dimension are mutually aligned in such a way that the entire text is experienced as a single unit
 yah spashtatya mana jaataa he ki, paath main pathgat aayam se hi pathshavarti aayam kii abhivyakti hoti he or pathshavarti aayam se pathgat aayam anushaasit hota he
 Thus, these two are interdependent
 pathbhed se sugathanaatmakataa kii gahanta main bhi antar aa jaataa he - anbhavi pathak apane abhyaaspusht antargyaan se grahan karata he 
 Accordingly, the depth of legibility available in a literary work is not felt in the final statement
 paath sanrachana ke anya pathparak aayam main ek vishisht paath kii, uske samaan yaa bhinn sandarbh vaale anya paathon se sambandh kii charchaa hoti he
 For example, the relationship between the language of the advertisement of a garment, the language used for the advertisement of a cosmetic, in terms of style, and the differentiation from the advertisement of a banking service is discussed
 is main anuwaad prakriya ke pramukh praroopon kii prakriya sambandhi chintan ke vibhinn pakshon ko jaanane ke liye charchaa hoti he
 The draftsman is often able to give special emphasis to only a few aspects of the process, being inspired by his translation circumstances and concerned thinking
 sarvanginata main is nunata kii purti is rup main ho jaati he ki, vivechit paksh ke sambandh main paryaapt jaankaree mil jaati he 
 From this point of view, Bathgate is visible
 anuwaad prakriya ke praroopon kii rachana ke peeche do prerak tatva pradhan rup se maane jate hai - maanav anuvaadakon kaa prashikshan tathaa yantra anuwaad kaa yantrik paksh
 Inspired by the requirements of both, theoretical explanations of the translation process were presented
 bahudhaa keval maanav anuvaadakon ke prashikshan kii aavashyaktaa se prerit anuwaad prakriya praroopon se hoti he
 Their usefulness is explained in the application dimension
 anuwaad prakriya kaa kendra bindu he lakshyabhasha main mulbhasha paath ke anuwaad paryaay prastut karnaa 
 This process is unilateral - from the root language to the target language
 parantu bhashaaon kii yah sthiti antauparivarty hoti he - jo pratham baar main mulbhasha he, vah dwitiya baar main lakshyabhasha ho sakati he 
 This process is also resolved by a map supported by the communication principle, which is as follows: vaktaa / lekhak kaa vichaar → mulbhasha kii abhivyakti rudhiyaan → mulbhasha paath → pratham shrota / pathak kii pratikriya → anuvadak kaa arthbodh → lakshyabhasha kii abhivyakti rudhiyaan → lakshyabhasha paath → dwitiya shrota / pathak kii pratikriya According to this format the translation process can have a total of eight steps
 lekhak yaa vaktaa ke man main uthne vaala vichaar mulbhasha kii abhivyakti rudhiyon main bandhakar mulbhasha ke paath kaa aakaar grahan karata he, jisase pehle shrota yaa pathak ke man main vaktaa / lekhak ke vichaar ke anuroop pratikriya prakat hoti he 
 The translator then, according to his / her talent, linguistics and subject knowledge, understands the meaning of the text of the native language and follows the expression conventions of the target language, following the text of the target language, which the other reader accepts
 is vyakhya se spasht hota he ki san0 5, arthath anuvadak kaa san0 3, 4 or 1 in teenon se sambandh he 
 He behaves the same way as the first reader by interpreting the text of the original language, and because the text of the original language symbolizes the idea of the speaker / writer, the translator is also joined by him
 isi praaroop ko vidwaanon ne prakaaraantar se bhi prastut kiya he 
 Contributions from Nida, Newmark, and Bathgate are discussed, for example
 naida ke anusaar ye anuwaad paryaay jis prakriya se nirdhaarit hote hai, uske do rup hai : pratyaksh or paroksh 
 There is a fundamental difference between these two
 pratyaksh prakriya ke praaroop ke anusaar mul paath kii bahyatleey sanrachana ke str par uplabdh bhashik ikaayiyon ke lakshyabhasha main anuwaad paryaay nishchit hote hai; or anuwaad prakriya ek krambaddh prakriya he, jisamen mul paath ke prayek ansh kaa anuwaad hota he 
 The process also has an intermediate position in which there is a distinct and universal linguistic structure; It has only theoretical importance
 is praaroop kii manyata ke anusaar, anuvadak mulbhasha paath ke sandesh ko sidhe lakshyabhasha main le jaataa he; vah in donon sthitiyon main mulbhasha paath or lakshyabhasha paath kii bahyatleey sanrachana ke str par hi rahata he 
 The task of selecting and presenting translations is similar to an automated process
 naida ne ek aarekh ke dwaara ise spasht kiya he : a xxrep 16 - xxrep 16 - b isamen 'k' mulbhasha he, 'kha' lakshyabhasha he, or '' vah madhyavarti sanrachana he, jo donon bhashaaon ke liye samaan hoti he or jo anuwaad ko sambhav banaati he; yahan donon bhashaayen ek-duusare ke saath is prakaar sambaddh ho jaati hai ki unka apana vaishishty kuch samay ke liye lupt ho jaataa he 
 The assumption in the format of the indirect process is that the translator goes beyond the textual structure of the text as needed, but often always, goes into the deeper structure of the text and then presents the appropriate translation synonym in the target language
 vastutah is praaroop main purvavarnit pratyaksh prakriya praaroop kaa antarbhaav ho jaataa he; donon main virodh nahin he
 It is the rule of direct process format that translation work takes place at the level of the external structure, while according to the indirect process, translation work is usually done through the deep structure of the text, although there is always a possibility that the native language in the language Many translations of the synonyms are found at the level of the outermost structure
 naida paroksh prakriya praaroop ke samarthak hai 
 They try to explain it by the following diagram - ya = mulbhasha kaa gahanstareey vishleshit paath r = Sectional level text in the target language naida ke anusaar anuwaad prakriya ke vastav main teen sopan hote hai- The translator first analyzes the text of the original language; By taking grammatical structure of the text and semantic analysis of words and word series, he takes the message of the text
 iske liye vah bhashaa-siddhanth par aadhaarit bhashaa-vishleshan kii takneekon kaa upyukt reeti se anuprayog karata he 
 In particular, the analysis of text is helpful in solving the difficulties in interpreting unusually complex and long and ambiguous sentences and phrases / phrases
 arthbodh ho jane ke pashchaat sandesh kaa lakshyabhasha main sankraman hota he 
 This process takes place in the translator's brain
 isamen mulpath ke lakshyabhashagat anuwaad-paryaay nirdhaarit hote hai tathaa donon bhashaaon ke madhya vibhinn staron or shreniyon main samanjasy sthapit hota he 
 Finally, the translator reconstructs the message of the native language according to its structure and usage rules and legislative conventions in the target language in such a way that it does not seem natural or at least unnatural to the reader of the target language
 anuwaad prakriya ke spashtikaran ke sandarbh main naida ne mulpath ke vishleshan ke liye ek sunishchit bhashaa siddhanth tathaa vishleshan kii ruparekha prastut kii he
 According to him, analysis of two aspects of language is required - grammar and semantics
 naida vyakaran ko keval vaakya athwa nimnatar shreniyon - upvakya, padabandh aadi - ke gathnaatmak vishleshan paryant simit nahin maanate 
 According to him, grammatical formation is also meaningful in a way
 udhaaharan ke liye, kartruvachya sanrachana or karmavachi / bhavvachya sanrachana main keval gathnaatmak antar hi nahin, apitu arth kaa antar bhi he 
 In this regard, he has drawn particular attention to the numerous structures
 udhaaharan ke liye, 'yah ram kaa chitra he' is vaakya ke nimnlikhit teen arth ho sakate hai : This picture is made by Ram
 is chitra main ram ankit he
 This picture is the property of Rama
 ye teenon vaakya, naida ke anusaar, bijvaky yaa upbijvaky hai, jinka nirdhaaran anuvarthi roopaantaran kii vidhi se kiya gaya he 
 These three sentences on the outer level structure are articulated as 'this is the picture of Ram' as this single sentence
 naida ne uparyukt roopaantaran vidhi kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he 
 His metaphorical notion is not as rigid and constitutive as Chamsky's notion of conversion-bred grammar, but is flexible and intuitive according to the nature and purpose of the application
 isi prakaar unhone shabdaarth kii do kotiyon - vaacharth or lakshya-vyangyarth- kaa varnanaatmak vishleshan kiya he 
 It is worth noting that Nida has presented the above mentioned system of analysis as a means of interpreting the text of the original language
 unka bal mulpath ke arth kaa yathasambhav purna or shuddh reeti se samajhane par rahaa he 
 Their system is considered suitable for the analytical interpretation of the language of the Bible and other ancient texts like it; Although it can also be used to interpret other and modern language texts
 vishleshan kii sahaayta se hue arthbodh kaa lakshyabhasha main sakrant anuwaad-prakriya kaa kendrastha sopan he
 In translation, the translator has to move between the two poles of analysis and reorganization, but this transition is through the path of transition stairway, where the translator has to see the steps of reorganization step more clearly
 sankraman kii yah prakriya anuvadak ke mastishk main tathaa apni prakruti se twarit tathaa antargyanamoolak hoti he 
 The translator's personality is consistent with this step in the translation process
 vishleshan se praapt bhashik tathaa sampreshan sambandhi tathyon kaa, upyukt anuwaad-paryaay sthir karne main, anuvadak jaisaa upyog karata he, usee main uski kushalta nihit hoti he 
 On the steps of analysis and restructuring, a translator may sometimes take some help from other people, but on the step of infection he is solitary
 sankraman ke sopan par vichaarneey baaten do hai - anuvadak kaa apana vyaktitv tathaa mulbhasha evam lakshyabhasha ke bich sankramanakalin samanjasy 
 The personality of the translator has special requirements for these subjects, linguistics, talent, and imagination
 tathaapi pradhanta kii drusht se pratibha or kalpana ko vishyagyaan tathaa bhashagyaan se adhik mahatva dena hota he, kyonki anuwaad pradhanthya ek vyaavhaarik or kriyaatmak kaary he 
 The translator can also overcome the lack of subject and linguistics with the help of others, but in terms of talent and imagination one has to depend on himself
 mulbhasha evam lakshyabhasha ke madhya samanjasy sthapit hona anuwaad-prakriya kii anivaary evam aantarik aavashyaktaa he 
 In the translation, the message is likely to be adversely affected
 is pratikulata ke prabhaav ko yathasambhav kam karne ke liye arthpaksh or vyakaran donon kii drushti se donon bhashaaon ke bich saamanjasy kii sthiti lani hoti he 
 Idioms and their figurative use, ambiguity, generality and specificity of meaning, etc
 are many such issues that have to be reconciled
 vyakaran kii drushti se prokti-sanrachana evam prakaar, vaakya-sanrachana evam prakaar tathaa pad-sanrachana evam prakaar sambandhi anek aisi baaten hai, jinka samaayojan apekshit hota he 
 For example, the use of an interjection in the text of the target language for a particular interjective used in the text, the grammatical adjustment issues in the target language being appropriate for the textual structure of the text
 sankraman kaa sopan anuwaad kaary kii drushti se jitna mahatvapurn he, anuwaad prakriya ke spashtikaran main uskaa apekshaakrit swatantra astitv shesh do sopanon kii tulana main utana spasht nahin 
 Often it becomes difficult to establish the difference between the steps of transition and reconstitution in the process's specification
 vishleshan or punargathan ke sopanon par, anuvadak kaa kartrutv yadi apekshaakrit swatantra hota he, to sankraman ke sopan par vah kuch adheenta kii sthiti main rahata he 
 The more important thing is that the translator should be aware of all the issues mentioned above
 yadi anuwaad-prashikshanarthi ke liye ye pratyaksh rup se upyogi maane jaaen, to abhyast anuvadak ke anuwaad-vyavhaar ke ye swaabhaavik ang maane ja sakate hai
 The meaning of the text of the text takes the form of a translation through the transition step, reorganized into the target language
 punargathan kaa sopan lakshyabhasha main moort abhivyakti kaa sopan he 
 Regarding the knowledge of the translation process, the major aspects of the text that the translators are intended to focus on are the steps of restructuring
 1) vyakaranik sanrachana tathaa prakaar, 2) Vocabulary, 3) sahprayog, 4) Language discrimination and stylistic patterns
 lakshyabhashagat upyuktata tathaa swaabhaaviktaa hi in sabaki aadharbhoot kasuti he
 The condition of equality in both languages is helpful for the elimination of these qualities, sometimes inequality
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah aavashyak nahin ki, mulbhasha ke padabandh ke liye lakshyabhasha kaa upyukt anuwaad-paryaay ek padabandh hi ho; yah sanrachana ek samast pad bhi ho sakati he; jaise, Diploma in translation = anuwaad diploma 
 It is to be seen that the restructuring of the message in the target language should conclude the condition of suitability and naturalness from the point of view of the above mentioned components; Those components should be in line with the 'subjectivity' and tradition of the target language
 mulbhasha main vyakaranik sanrachana ke katipay tathyon kaa lakshyabhasha main swaroop badal saktaa he, yadhyapi yah sadaa aavashyak nahin hota 
 For example, the passive structure of the English text "steps have been taken by the Government to meet the situation" can also be presented in the passive structure in Hindi, also in the participial structure: "actions by the government to confront the situation Has been done / the government has taken action to face the situation
 " parantu "the meeting was chaired by X" ke liye hindi main kartruvachya sanrachana "ksha ne baithak kii adhyakshata kii" upyukt prathit hota he
 Such decisions are made at the level of reorganization
 yahi baat sahprayog ke liye he 
 Each language has its own co-operation
 angreji main to take a step kehete hai, to hindi main 'kaarywahi karnaa' 
 In this example, the translation of to take would be mistaken for 'lifting': they are both used in their respective languages as lexical units that cannot be broken down
 bhashabhed ke antargat, kaalgat, sthangat or prayojanamulak bhashaabhedon kii gananaa hoti he 
 However, at the level of a structured text, all these are seen as stylistic
 udhaaharan ke liye, puraani angreji kii rachana kaa hindi main anuwaad karte samay, punargathan ke sopan par anuvadak ko yah nirnay karnaa hoga ki, lakshyabhasha ke kis bhashabhed ke shailigat prabhaav mulbhashapath ke shailigat prabhaavon ke samakaksh ho sakate hai 
 From this point of view, the translation of the text of Old English into Old Hindi may also be appropriate, even in modern Hindi
 shailigat pratimaan ko vihang drushti se do roopon main samajhaayaa jaataa he : saahityetar style or saahitiyik style 
 In the non-literary genre, these two distinctions are found prominently against informal and non-technical against formal
 saahitiyik style main paath ke vidhaagat bhedon - gadhy or padya, aadi kaa vishesh rup se ullekh kiya jaataa he 
 In this view, the text of the formal style should be presented in the formal language in the target language itself, or the original prose composition should be presented as the prose in the target language itself, the decision has to be made according to the suitability based on the tradition of the target language
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhartiya bhashaaon main gadhy kii tulana main padya kii parampara adhik pusht he; atah unamem mul gadhy paath kaa yadi padyatmak bhashaantaran ho, to vah bhi upyukt prathit ho saktaa he 
 To summarize, the message is reconstituted in the target language based on what appears to be natural and appropriate in the target language and which is compatible with the target language's tradition - naturalness, appropriateness and tradition, all three being interdependent
 naida kii pranali kis prakaar kaam karti he, use nimna udahaarnon kii sahaayta se bhi samajhaayaa jaataa he
 An example is from the context of public information
 k = No admission y = Admission is not allowed r = pravesh kii anumati nahin he
 b = Entry is forbidden / No entry is allowed
 ukt anuwaad ke anusaar, 'k' mulbhasha kaa paath he jo ek saarvajanik nirdesh kii bhashaa kaa udhaaharan he 
 This is a short sentence
 iske arth ko spasht karne ke liye vishleshan kii vidhi se anugami roopaantaran dwaara anuvadak iskaa bijvaky nirdhaarit karata he, yah bijvaky 'ya' he; isi se 'k' vyutpann he 
 At the step of transition, 'Y' is an infrastructural and synonym 'R' which takes the form of 'B' at the level of reorganization by preceding conversion
 'kha' ke do bhed hai; donon hi shuddh maane jate hai; unamem antar style kii drushti se he 
 'entry is forbidden' has formality and is suitable for the educated class; 'coming in is forbidden' has informality and is considered suitable for everyone in general and for underprivileged classes in particular; Both informativeness and prescriptiveness are safe
 yahan prashasnic angreji kaa nimnalikhat vaakya he, jo mulpath he or ukt anuwaad ke anusaar 'k' ke str par he : It becomes very inconvenient to move to the section officer's table along with all the relevant papers a number of times during the day in connection with the above mentioned work
 one moves to the section officer's table
 one moves to the section officer's table, with all the relevant papers
 one moves to the section officer's table, with all the relevant papers, a number of times during the day
 one moves to the section officer's table with all the relevant papers, a number of times during the day, in connection will above mentioned work
 chitra main is vaakya kaa vishleshan do khandon main kiya gaya he 
 In the first section, it is divided into two parts - the higher sentence and the lower sentence, which are largely considered as traditional clauses of syntax - the main clause and the dependent clause
 duusare khand main donon - ucchtar tathaa nimnatar vaakyon kaa vishleshan he
 The higher sentence has three elements, in which the complement is related to the subject; He is the complement of the doer
 nimnatar vaakya main It kaa poorak he to move or vah karta ke sthaan par aane ke kaaran sangyapadabandh he, kyonki karta koi samp hi ho saktaa he 
 This sampa is derived from a sentence whose basic structure shows the subject, the verb and a series of three adverbs
 is aadharbhoot, nimnatar vaakya kii sanrachana kaa spashtikaran se paryant ke upwakyon main hua he 
 It explains the gradual combination of adverbs
 chitra main pradarshit naida ke matanusaar yah prakriya kaa 'ya' str he
 The direct and indirect translation process formats are then compared
 pratyaksh prakriya praaroop ke anusaar uparyukt vaakya ke nimnlikhit anuwaad kiye ja sakate hai : "it is inconvenient to go to the Section Officer several times a day regarding all the above mentioned papers in relation to the above mentioned work" or "it is inconvenient to go to the Section Officer several times a day regarding all the above mentioned papers regarding the above mentioned work
 
 " 'ya' se 'r' par aana sankraman kaa sopan he, jis par mulpath tathaa lakshyabhasha paath ke madhya taal-mail baitaane ke praytn ke chihn bhi malate hai 
 But according to the indirect procedure format, the translators use the method of analysis above, and accordingly the appropriate translation of the sentence presented may be as follows - "to the Section Officer with all the relevant papers in connection with the above work, which may be done several times a day Have to go, there is a lot of inconvenience in it
 " yah vaakya 'kha' str par he tathaa purnagathan ke sopan se sambandhit he 
 The combination of adverbs in the said translation and the phraseological structure of the lower sentence of the text - to move to the section officer's table - instead of the adverbial phrase in translation - using 'section officer who has to go several times a day', These two points are worth noting, this is explained to the translator or translation trainee for clarity
 falswaroop, anuwaad main spashtataa or swaabhaaviktaa kii nishpatti kii apeksha hoti he 
 At the same time, the emphasis on the main clause in the text in terms of meaning is also safe
 in donon vaakyon kaa anuwaad tathaa vishleshan, mukhya rup se vishleshan kii takanic tathaa uski upyogita ke spashtikaran ke liye dwaara kiya gaya he 
 Both of them have their own characteristics of linguistics and language structure, which are explained to the theoretical and systemic role of translation-trainees and can develop a sense of confidence in the translation process and knowledge of the suitability of the translated text, which the successful translator Is expected to become
 newmark ke anusaar anuwaad prakriya kaa praaroop nimnlikhit aarekh ke madhyam se prastut kiya ja saktaa he : An overview of the process proposed by Nida and Newmark showed that there is no fundamental difference in the perception of the translation process
 bible anuvadak hone ke kaaran naida kii drushti pracheen paath ke anuwaad kii samasyaon se adhik bandhi dikhi; atah ve vishleshan, sankraman tathaa punargathan ke sopanon kii kalpana karte hai 
 Being an ancient creation, the problem of eclipses in the language of the Bible is more associated with the grammatical structure of the language
 itah naida ke anuwaad sambandhi bhashaa siddhanth main vyakaran ko vishesh mahatva kaa sthaan praapt hota he
 'analysis' is considered to be a special aid in grammar related to grammatical formation, hence Nida also named nopan 'analysis'
 newmark kii drushti aadhunik tathaa vaividhypurna bhashaabhedon ke anuwaad kaary kii samasyaon se anupranit maani jaati he
 Hence, they visualize the steps of perception and expression
 parantu ve mulbhasha paath ko lakshyabhasha paath se bhi jodate hai, jisase donon paathon kaa anuwaad-sambandh tulana tathaa vyatirek ke sandarbh main spasht ho sake 
 Numark also presents specific language theories for comprehension, in which they give semantics a place of central importance
 apane vibhinn lekhon main unhone apni saiddhanthik sthapana kaa vivaran prastut kiya he 
 Their format is explained by an example: 1
 mulbhasha paath : Judgment has been reserved 1
1 Bodhan: Judgment will not be announced immediately
 2
 abhivyakti : nirnay abhi nahin sunaaya jayega
 2
1 Target language text: to be recited after the decision
 3
 shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad : nirnay - liya gaya he - surakshit 
 With word-to-word translation, where the difference between the two languages is clear, the relationship between the two languages also appears at the semantic level
 anuvaadakon ko gyaat ho jaataa he ki reserved ke liye hindi main 'surakshit' yaa 'arakshit' sahi shabd he, parantu Judgement yaa 'nirnay' ke aise sahprayog main, jaisaa ki uparyukt vaakya main dikhaai detaa he, shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad karnaa upyukt na hoga 
 This theory also makes it clear that, it is more appropriate to say the translation between two specific language distinctions or the relation between two specific texts, in which the size of the unit of translation, related linguistics or textual message is more appropriate than the translation between two languages
 Is determined by the nature of
 prastut vaakya main sampoorn vaakya hi anuwaad kii ikai he, kyonki isamen shabdon kaa upyukt anuwaad anyonyashray sambandh aadhaarit he 
 The translators also know that the translation of the above sentence in Hindi news, 'judgment has been reserved', is often seen as why it seems unnatural, unsuitable and unpromising
 shabdashah anuwaad kii uparyukt pravriti kaa pradarshan karne vaale anuwaadon ko 'anuwadabhas' kaha jaataa he
 In fact the process of translation has an element of frequency, that is, translators translate twice
 mulpath ke bodhan ke liye mulbhasha main anuwaad kiya jaataa he : No admission → admission is not allowed; isi prakaar lakshyabhasha main sandesh ke punargathan yaa abhivyakti ko lakshyabhasha paath kaa aakaar dete hue ham lakshyabhasha main uskaa pun: anuwaad karte hai; 'pravesh kii anumati nahin he' → 'andar aana manaa he'
 Thus in bilingual translation, the status of bilingual translation at the level of both languages comes
 inhen kramshah bodhanatmak anuwaad punarabhivyaktimulak anuwaad kaha jaataa he 
 Perceptual translation is the instrument form - intended to clarify the meaning of the text
 punarabhivyaktimulak anuwaad saadhy rup he - vaastavik anudit paath 
 If it is in the semi-formal or informal form of a habitual translator, the translation-trainee has the need and utility of its formal presentation so that it can assimilate the translation process even at the level of knowledge
 bathget apane praaroop ko sankriyaatmak praaroop kehete hai, jo anuwaad kaary kii vyaavhaarik prakruti se vishesh mail khaane ke saath-saath naida or newmark ke praroopon se adhik vyapak mana jaataa he 
 The author has presented it through the following picture - isamen saat sopanon kii kalpana kii gai he, jinamein se paryaalochan ke sopan ke atirikt shesh sarv main ativyapti kaa avkaash mana jaataa he parantu saiddhanthik str par inke apekshaakrit swatantra astitv ko manyata pradaan kii gai he 
 It is syncing to know the basics of the original language text and align your mindset with the text accordingly
 yah sopan mulpath ke sab pakshon ke dhoomil se avabodhan par aadhaarit maansik sajjataa kaa sopan he, jo anuwaad kaary main prayukt hone kii abhiprerana kii vyakhya karata he tathaa anuwaad kii kaaryniti ke nirdhaaran ke liye aavashyak bhoomika nirmaan kaa spashtikaran prastut karata he 
 The steps of analysis and perception are the same
 paribhaashik abhivyaktiyon ke antargat bathget un anshon ko lete hai, jo mulpath ke sandesh kii nishpatti main anya anshon kii tulana main vishesh mahatva ke hai or jinke anuwaad paryaayon ke nirdhaaran main vishesh dhyaan dene kii aavashyaktaa wo maanate he 
 The reorganization is also similar to before
 punarikshan ke antargat anudit paath kaa sampoorn anveshan aata he 
 In addition to correcting handwriting or typographical errors, the expression requires revision of grammaticality, refinement, euphoria, clarity, naturalness, appropriateness, taste, and modern use of the translated text in terms of modern usage
 yah kaary praayah anuvadak se bhinn vyakti, anuvadak se yathochit sahaayta lete hue, karata he 
 If the translator himself has to do this work, then there must be such a disruption of time in translation work and revision work that the translator can freely move from the loop of translation memory to adopt a neutral and critical view of the translated text and thus different from the translator Be able to bear the responsibility paryaalochan ke sopan main vishay visheshgy or anuvadak ke madhya samvaad ke dwaara anudit paath kii pramanikta kii pushti kaa praavdhaan he 
 The usefulness of research is evident in the lessons whose content requires authenticity - such as law, natural science, social science, technology, etc
 ek udhaaharan ke dwaara bathget ke praaroop ko spasht kiya jaataa he
 The primary text is the information phrase written on a truck by Public Carrier
 The translator makes it clear that while doing the mental rigor of its translation, the purpose of this phrase is to give the public a specific information about the availability of the truck
 is vaakyansh ke sandesh main jahaan prabhavaparak yaa sambodhanatmak prakaarya kii satta he, vahaan suchanaatmak prakaarya bhi is drushti se upasthit he ki, uskaa vidhikshetreey or prashasnic paksh he - in donon drushtiyon se aise trek par kuch pratibandh lagu hote hai 
 So overall this phrase is translatable through a communication-centric system
 vishleshan ke sopan par anugami roopaantaran ke dwaara anuvadak iskaa bodhanatmak anuwaad karte hue bijvaky yaa vaakyansh nirdhaarit karte hai : It carries goods of the public = Carrier of public goods
 bodhan ke sopan par anuvadak ko yah spasht hota he ki, It can be hired = "ise bhade par liya ja saktaa he 
 "on the footsteps of a technical expression, translators recognize it as a methodical-administrative expression, making the translation of the message communicative, and the translator must also preserve its correctness
 punargathan ke sopan par anuvadak ke saamne is vaakyansh ke do anuwaad hai : 'lokvahan' or 'bhade kaa trek' 
 On the role of previous steps, it becomes clear to the translator that - in 'lokavahana', the legal aspect of the message may be safe but it does not serve the purpose of communication
 is abhivyakti se saadhaaran padhe-likhe ko yah turant pataa nahin chalata ki lokvahan kaa uske liye kya upyog he 
 In order to make it communicable, it requires an iterative translation - 'hire truck' - which makes it clear to the public what this truck is used for
 mul abhivyakti itani choti tathaa uski sweekrut anuwaad 'bhaade kaa trek' itnaa spasht he ki, iske sambandh main punarikshan tathaa paryaalochan ke sopan apekshit nahin, aisa kaha jaataa he
 Consideration of two different forms of the translation process leads to two clear conclusions
 pehali, anuwaad prakriya ek kramik prakriya he, jisamen teen sthitiyaan banati hai - Pre-translation status - Understanding the context of translation work
 kis pathsaamagree kaa, kis uddeshy se, kis koti ke pathak ke liye, kis madhyam main, anuwaad karnaa he, aadi iske antargat he 
 Status of translation work - Textual language text, sequencing, expression in target language
 anuvadottar sthiti - anudit paath kaa punarikshan-sampaadan tathaa is prakaar antatah ‘surachit' paath kii nishpatti
 The second point is that translation, the text comprehension and expression in the target language, is a continuous process between these two poles, which is curved and indirect rather than straight and direct
 vah madhyavarti sthiti jiske jariye yah prakriya sampann hoti he, ek vaicharik sangyanatmak sanrachana he, jo mulpath ke bodhan se nishpann hoti he tathaa jisamen lakshyabhashagat abhivyakti ke bhi beej nihit rahete hai 
 This language is a pure economical entity free from the bonding of particular relative words
 is madhyavarti sanrachana kaa adhishthan anuvadak kaa mastishk hota he 
 The consciousness of power of this conceptual structure is relatively clear in relatively close languages from a cultural-structural point of view
 vaicharik str par sthit hone ke kaaran isaki bhautik satta nahin hoti - bhashik abhivyakti ke str par yah yathatath rup main ek yatharth kaa rup grahan nahin karti; yadi anuvadak bhashik str par ise abhivyakt bhi karte hai, to keval saiddhanthik aavashyaktaa kii drushti se, jisamen vishleshan ke rup main kuch vaakyon tathaa vaakyanshon kaa punarlekhan antarbhoot hota he 
 But it is also true that this is the structure, which translates and translates into the target language text
 is baat ko anya shabdo main bhi kaha jaataa he ki, anuvadak mulbhashapath kii vaicharik sanrachana kaa anuwaad karata he parantu anuwaad kii prakriya kii yah aantarik visheshta he ki jo saranchana antatogatva lakshya bhashaa main anudit hoti he, vah he madhyavarti vaicharik sanrachana jo mulpath kii vaicharik sanrachana ke anuvadak krit bodh se nishpann he ! This representation of the translation process leads to an explanation of two things at the theoretical level
 ek, mulbhashapath ke anuwaadakeey bodh se nishpann vaicharik sanrachana hi kyonki lakshyabhashapath kaa rup grahan karti he, atah anuvadak bhed se anuwaad bhed dikhaai padataa he 
 Secondly, the above conceptual structure is uniquely language-specific - it has the possibility to be expressed in the same and closest form as possible through both languages
 mulbhashapath kaa sandesh jo anudit ho jaataa he uski yah vyakhya he 
 Based on the above description of the translation process, three fundamental elements of the nature of the translation process are determined: parity, dialectics, and translation perturbation
 anuwaad kaary main anuvadak mulbhashapath ke lakshyabhashagat paryaayon se jis samanta kii baat karata he, vah mulya kii drushti se hoti he 
 This element of value is not limited to the semantics of language and the facts of grammar, but often arises from something more than that and from the context of linguistics
 vastutah yah ek pathasanketavaigyanik sankalpana he tathaa sandesh str kii samanta se judi he 
 In linguistic analysis of language, equivalence is the virtue of a message, in which the text is accepted in its entirety, despite being based on synonyms or interrelationships at the level of meaning
 yah avashya he ki samamoolyata ke nirdhaaran main pathaceketvigyaan ke teen ghatakon ke adhikram kaa yogadan rahata he - vaakyastareey samamoolyata par arthstareey samamoolyata ko praadhanya miltaa he tathaa arthstareey samamoolyata par sandarbhastareey samamoolyata ko manyata di jaati he 
 In other words, if parity is not established at the level of syntax in both languages, econometric equivalence has to be determined, and if economical equivalence cannot be determined, then contextual equivalence must be recognized
 udhaaharan ke liye, The meeting was chaired by X" ke hindi anuwaad “ksha ne baithak kii adhyakshata kii" main samamoolyata kaa nirdhaaran vaakya str se upar arth str par hua he, kyonki donon kii vakyarachanaon main vachya kii drushti se asamanta he 
 Similarly, What time is it? Hindi translation of 'what time is it?' The parity between has been determined at the level of the above reference level - asking time, which is a reference to daily social behavior
 is prakaar samamoolyata kii sthiti pathacenket ke sanghatnatmak paksh main hone ke saath-saath sampreshnatmak paksh main bhi hoti he, jisamen sampreshnatmak paksh kaa sthaan sanghatnatmak paksh se upar hota he 
 Consideration of equality as a textual conceptual concept allows the practice to be able to meet the requirements of translation work based on the recognition of communication
 mulbhasha kaa paath kis bhashabhed se sambandhit he, uskaa uddisht / sambhavit pathak koun he, anuwaad karne kaa uddeshy kya he - in tathyon ke aadhaar par anuwaad samamoolyon kaa nirdhaaran hota he 
 In this process, if they can sometimes differ from the semantic expressions and the congruence of the constitutive structures, then in some contexts, the possibility of them being integral, so and so, cannot be ruled out
 yah thik he ki bhashaayen sanrachana, styleey pratimaan aadi kii drushti se anshatah asmaan hoti hai or yah bhi thik he ki ve anshatah samaan bhi hoti hai; mukhya baat yah he ki un samaan tathaa asmaan binduon ko pahachaanaa jaae 
 Equality becomes a flexible situation in terms of communication
 anuwaad main moolyagat samanta hi uplabdh kerani hoti he 
 Translative parity is as natural as possible from the point of view of the target language and as close as possible to the textual text
 iskaa ek ullekhneey gun he
 Dynamicism, which means that the reader of the translation has the same acceptance of the translation equivalents as the relevant expressions of the original readers
 sweekaaryata yaa pratikriya kii yah samanta ubhaypaksheeya hone se gatisheel he, or yahi anuwaad samamoolyata kii gatyaatmakataa he 
 Translation is concerned with two situations
 ise anuvadak dwandvatmakataa kahete hai
 This dialectics is not limited only to the dimensions of language, but permeates all translation situations
 isaki mul visheshta he santulan, saamanjasy yaa samjhauta 
 The different dimensions of dialecticality of translation as a process, relationship, and conclusion are represented as follows: 1
 anuwaad main, mul lekhak tathaa duusare pathak ke bich sampark sthapit hota he 
 There is a difference between the original writer and the other reader in the form of dialecticality from distance or proximity in terms of country or time or both
 sthaan kii drushti se mul lekhak tathaa pathak donon hi videshi ho sakate hai, swadeshi ho sakate hai, yaa inamen se ek videshi or ek swadeshi ho saktaa he 
 Both can be past in terms of time, both may be contemporary, or the author may be past and contemporary
 in sab sthitiyon se anuwaad prakriya prabhavit hoti he
 2
 In translation, the balance between the original author and the translator is required
 anuvadak ko mul lekhak kii chintan paddati or abhivyakti paddati ke saath apni chintan paddati tathaa abhivyakti paddati kaa samanjasy sthapit karnaa hota he
 3
 In translation, there is a contract between the translator and the reader of the translation
 anuvadak kaa anuwaad karne kaa uddeshy vahi ho jo anuwaad ke pathak kaa anuwaad padhane ke sambandh main he 
 It is necessary for the translator to adapt his language usage to the comprehensibility of the potential reader of the translation
 4
 anuwaad main, anuvadak kii vyaktigat ruchi tathaa uski vyavsaayik aavashyaktaa kaa samanvay apekshit he 
 5
 Complete translation is impossible from the point of view of its nature and the translated work cannot be exactly the same as the original work, but in socio-cultural and political-economic terms, translation work is not only important but also necessary and relevant
 ek safal anuwaad main ukt donon sthitiyon kaa santulan hota he
 6
 In translation, in the context of the relationship between two languages, the dialectical relation between another language structure and language use is clear, on the other hand, a state of equilibrium between the general side of language use and the specific side emerges
 She comes
 7
 anuwaad main, do bhashaaon kii vishisht prayuktiyon ke do vishisht paathon ke madhya vibhinn staron or ayaamon par samaayojan apekshit hota he 
 These levels / dimensions are - grammatical formation, level of dictionary, arrangement of syllabus, co-operation, semantics, arrangement, linguistic conventions, language functions, text types, literary socio-cultural conventions
 8
 gunatmak drushti se anuwaad main vividh prakaar ke santulan dikhaai dete hai
 Complete translation of any text at all levels / dimensions is impossible, but translation of all types of texts is possible
 ek safal anuwaad main nimnlikhit yugmon ke ghatak santulan kii sthiti main dikhaai dete hai - vishuddhta or sampreshniyata, rupanishthata or prakaaryaatmakataa, shabdikta or swatantrata, mulanishthata or sundarata, or udriktata tathaa samasikta 
 Accordingly, a successful translation is as pure, metaphorical, literal, and original as possible, and as communicative as possible, independent, and beautiful
 isi prakaar ek safal anuwaad main udriktata kii pravriti he, parantu lakshyabhasha prayog ke kaushal kii drushti se uskaa sankshipt hona vaanchhit hota he
 9
 From the functional point of view, according to the law of compensation, translation mainly consists of coexistence in the components of the following pairs: exclusion-joining and rhetoric-comprehensibility
 lakshyabhasha main vyakt sandesh ke saushthavpurn punargathan ke liye mul paath main se kuch chhotna tathaa lakshyabhasha paath main kuch judana avashyambhavi he 
 If something is left, then something will be connected; The special thing is that as many as are not possible to be left untouched and not to be connected
 mulpath kii kuch alankarik abhivyaktiyaan, jaise roopak, anuwaad main jab lakshyabhasha main sakrant nahin ho paatin to anlankrita abhivyaktiyon kaa prayog karnaa hota he - alankaar kii prabhavotpaadakta kaa sthaan saamaanya kathan kii subodhta le leti he 
 The same thing can happen in the opposite way - an ornate expression is selected in the target language for comprehensible expression of the original, but it is necessary to have a popular orientation of the target language which is effective as well as comprehensible
 dwandvatmakataa ke vibhinn ayaamon ke vivechan se anuwadasaapeksh sampreshan kii prakruti par vyapak prakaash padataa he 
 The more acceptable this balance is, the more successful the translation appears
 anuwaad kaary main anuwaad parivritti ek avashyambhavi tathaa vaanchhneeya evam swaabhaavik sthiti he 
 Transition means deviation from different levels of communality between the two languages
 vichlan kii do sthitiyaan ho sakati hai - anivaary tathaa aichhik 
 Essential deviation is the difference between the semantic and grammatical structure of the language; For example, the Marathi impotence noun would be translated into Hindi as a masculine or feminine noun
 kuch isi prakaar kii baat angreji vaakya i have fever ke hindi anuwaad 'mujhe fever he' ke liye kahi ja sakati he, kyonki 'main fever rakhata hoon' hindi main sampreshnatmak tathy ke rup main sweekrut nahin 
 Optional deviations have a choice of options
 angreji "the rule states that" ko hindi main do roopon main kaha ja saktaa he - “is niyam main yah vyavastha he ki / kaha gaya he ki " yaa "yah niyam kahata he ki "
 In both of these, the first sentence seems to be natural in Hindi, though not as much as the second, although now it is also considered more prevalent
 ek upyukt anuwaad main pehle anuwaad ko praathamikta milegi 
 The special relevance of voluntary deviations in the context of translation is such that it helps in making the translation natural
 anivaary vichlan, tulanaatmak-vyatireki bhashaa vishleshan kaa ek saamaanya tathy he, jisamen anuwaad kaa prayog ek upkaran ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The concept of translation-orientation has primarily been associated with grammar
 yah do roopon main dikhaai detaa he - vyakaranik shabdon kii parivritti tathaa vyakaranik kotiyon kii parivritti 
 An example of the permeation of grammatical words appears in the above syntax
 angreji kaa nirdharak yaa nishchaytmak artical the hindi main sanketvachak visheshan 'yah / is' ho gaya he, yadhyapi yah anivaary vichlan ke antargat he 
 In grammatical categories, translators pay special attention to two distinctions - grammatical categories of permeability and category permeation
 vaakya main vyakaranik kotiyon kii vinyasakramaatmak sanrachana main parivritti kaa udhaaharan he angreji ke sakarmak vaakya main prakaaryaatmak kotiyon ke kram, karta + kriya + karm, kaa hindi main badalakar karta + karm + kriya ho janaa 
 It is under compulsory deviation of circumcision; Therefore, it is contrasting
 shrenee parivritti kaa prasiddh udhaaharan he mulbhasha ke padabandh kaa lakshyabhasha main upvakya ho janaa yaa upvakya kaa padabandh ho janaa 
 Examples of this type of circumcision are often found in english-hindi translation - The English text of the safety guidelines in Indian Railways is titled: "travel safely" and the title of the Hindi text is: 'measures for safety', while also in English
 a phrase can be - "measures of safety
" Similarly, examples of translating the unit as a phrase in a hierarchical, especially all-level level, are often found - English "she is a good natured girl" = "she is a good-natured girl"
 shrenee parivritti ke donon udhaaharan aichhik vichlan ke antargat hai 
 In the context of translation from English to Hindi, especially in the context of the translation of administrative texts, the following are the major translation circumferences found: transitive structure with inanimate subject = h
 Non-intransitive structure: The rule states that = is niyam main yah vyavastha he ki
 And Rhetoric / Rhetoric = Rhetoric / Rhetoric: The meeting was chaired by x = ksha ne baithak kii adhyakshata kii
 i cannot drink milk now = i will not drink milk anymore
 an0 purvasargayukt / vartmaankalik kridant padabandh = hi0 upvakya : to issue instructions = issue those instructions
 an0 upvakya = hi0 padabandh : till a decision is taken on the main file = until a decision is made on the main file
