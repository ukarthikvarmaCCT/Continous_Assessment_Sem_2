 chini samyavaadee dal kii sthapana 1921 main hui thi
 In 1949, the incident of the Chinese Communist Party seizing power in China is called the Chinese Communist Revolution
 china main 1946 se 1949 tak grihayuddh kii sthiti thi
 The second phase of this civil war came in the form of communist revolution
 china ne aadhikarik taur par is avadhi ko 'mukti sangram' kaha jaataa he
 By the middle of the 19th century, China had remained an ignorant, demolished, battered Asian country almost unaware of its glorious history
 bhale hi vah aupchaarik rup se kisi videshi takat kaa upnivesh nahin tha parantu uski haalat kisi duusare gulam desh se behatar nahi thi
 Historians called the struggle of European powers in China as "weed of melons", a fruit which the people of their choice cut and split among themselves, eat and digest

 The coastal ports were also under military control of the Europeans
 britain kii nausainik shakti kaa muqabla karne kii kshamta china main nahin thi isliye china ke vyapaar par unheen kaa niyantran tha
 Britain had promoted the consumption of opium in China to protect its selfishness, and had greatly oppressed the drunk Chinese
 atah yah swaabhaavik tha ki rashtrapermi chinia ke man main in utpeedak paristhitiyon ke prati aakrosh punap rahaa tha
 The nature of China's first revolution was primarily cultural and was initiated by Dr
 Sanyat Sen
 unheen ke prayatnon se rashtravaadi chini party kii sthapana hui jise 'kuomitang' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The Manchu dynasty that ended the republic was founded in 1911 and its provisional president was Yuvan Shih Kai
 kintu usne pratikriyaavaadi evam damanaatmak kadam uthaate hue kuomitanga dal par pratibandh laga diya or sanyaat sen ko japan bhaagna padaa
 Yuwan Shih Kai also died in 1916 and after his death the provincial governor and generals declared themselves independent, the whole of China was divided under the control of many war chiefs
 1917 i
 main kuomitanga dal ne araajaktaa ke maahaul main ganatantric sarkaar kii sthapana kaa prayaas kiya
 At the same time, influenced by the communist revolution in Russia, in 1923, Sanayat Sen tried to form a democratic government by entering into a cooperative treaty with the Russian communist government, but it was not completed due to his death in 1925
 aage unke uttaradhikari chyang kaai shaike ko china ke samyavaadee dal ke saath grih yuddh main funsana padaa
 Finally, on 1 October 1949, the Communist Party under the leadership of Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China
 1917 main hui rus kii bolshevik kranti ke prabhaav se chini bhi achoota na rahaa
 In 1919 Peking teachers and students established an institution for the study of communism, Marxism
 inhen vyaktiyon main maotse tung bhi shaamil tha jo aage chalakar chini samyavaadee dal kaa netaa bana
 The Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1919 with the efforts of these people
 sheeghra hi canton, shanghai or hunaan praanton main bhi communist party kii shakhaayen kaayam ho gai or 1921 main shanghai main in sab shakhaon kaa pratham sammelan hua jisamen videshi aadhipaty se china ko mukti dilaanaa lakshya ghoshit kiya gaya
 This communist ideology also influenced the liberal nationalists of China, including Sanayat Sen
 vastutah dow sanyaat sen china ko sangathit karne ke liye videshi sahaayta praapt karnaa chahta tha lekin pashchim ke samrajyavaadee rajyon ne unki koi madad nahin kii antat vah soviet sangh kii ore aakrisht hua
 Russia expressed sympathy for China in the greed for communist proliferation and assured it of all assistance
 isi sandarbh main 1921 i
 main comintern ke pratinidhi mering ne sanyaat sen se mulaakaat kar aapasi sahyog kii charchaa kii
 Dr
 Sanayat Sen's understanding and organizational ability led to a cooperative relationship between the Kuomitang and the Chinese Communist Party
 roosi samyavaadee vichaarkon ne chini communist party ko kuomitanga dal ke saath miljul kar kaary karne ko kaha
 Together, they started working against imperialism
 sanyaat sen ke jivit rahane tak yah sahyog bana rahaa or donon dal miljul kar kaary karte rahe
 But on 12 March 1925, Sanayat Sen died
 tatpashchaat chini samyavaadee dal tathaa kuomitanga ke bich matbhed utpann hone lage
 In fact, the Chinese communists were trying to strengthen their organization
 unhone kisaanon or mazdooron ko apane paksh main sangathit kiya or rashtriya str par ek majdoor sangh kii sthapana kii
 As a result, the frequency of strikes and demands of workers increased
 isi tarah kisaanon ke sangh bane jinhone lagaan main kami tathaa jameendaari unmoolan kii maang kii
 After the death of Sanayat Sen in 1925, Maotse Tung launched a fierce peasant movement in Hunan Province
 is andolan ne na sirf jameendaaron ko ukhaad phenkaa balki sampatti par kabja kar samaaj ke dhaanche ko badla
 After the death of Sunayat Sen, Chuang Kai-shek became the chief of the Kuomitang Dal
 uski sadbhaavna vyavsaasiyon va jameendaaron ke saath thi
 He expelled the Communists from the Kuomitang Dal
 chyang kaa maananaa tha ki communist shaktishaalee hote ja rahe hai jo jameendaaron par akraman kar unki sampatti par kabja kar rahe hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate them
 chyang kaai shaike ne communiston ko party se nikaal kar shuddhikaran andolan chalaaya jisamen hajaaron communist, trade unionist tathaa kisaan netaa maare gaye
 In this way Chiang Kai-shek firmly established his power in Nanking
 1943 i
 main maotse tung chini communist party kii kendriya samiti kaa adhyaksh hua or sheershasth netaa ban gaya
 The Communist Party under Mao's leadership expanded its power and made it the center of power in the "qiangsi" province
 dhire-dhire frukien, hunaan aadi praanton main bhi apni satta sarkarein sthapit kii
 Meo made a massive change in the Communist Party's strategy, emphasizing that the Communist Party should try to gain public support among the peasants compared to the industrial laborers
 kaaran yah tha ki china multah ek krishi pradhan desh tha jahaan audyogic kranti abhi pichhadi hui thi
 The Communist Mao government of Qiangsi province did not accept the power of the Kuomitang government of Nanking
 chyang kaai check ke adheen nanking kii sarkaar apni sthiti ko majboot karne ke liye kiyangsi kii communist sarkaar ke viruddh 1934 i
 main bhayankar abhiyaan kiya
 It is known as the "abolition Campaign"
 lakhon kii sankhya main communiston ko maut ke ghat utaara gaya
 In order to avoid this oppression and tyranny, the communists "mahaprasthan" towards the province of Shenxi in the north which started from October 16, 1934 and completed in October 20, 1935
 is 6000 mile lambi duuri ko anek nadiyon, pahaado, jangalon ko paar karte hue shensi praant ke yenon nagar main pahunch kar use rajdhani banaakar vahaan apni sarkaar sthapit kii
 It is worth noting here that in 1921 AD, Japan invaded China
 chyang kaai shaike ne is samay japani khatre se bada khatra samyawad ko samajha or apni sampoorn shakti samyavaadiyon ke daman main laga di
 The Communists established their government in the province of Shenxi, which was near the North China occupied by Japan, and the Communists spoke out against the Japanese invasion and dominance
 maao ne kaha ki kuomitanga or samyavaadiyon donon ko milakar desh main ek sarkaar kii sthapana kerani chahie or milakar japani akraman kaa muqabla kar, unhen desh main ek sarkaar kii sthapana kerani chahie or milakar japani akraman kaa muqabla kar, unhen desh se baahar kar dena chahie
 Due to this view of the communists, the majority of the Chinese people joined them and as a result, the communists got a chance to increase their power
 chyang kaai shaike japaniyon ko rokane ke bajaay communiston kaa safaya karnaa adhik mahatvapurn maanata tha or isliye 1936 main samyavaadiyon se sangharsh karne ke liye liyang ke netritv main ek sena shensi praant bheji kintu samyavaadiyon ne apane chini bhaiyon se ladanaa uchit nahin samajha or liyang ke adheen bheji gai sena ko rashtriya chetana se yukt kar japaniyon se sangharsh karne ko kaha
 When Chiang Kai-shek spoke of the suppression of the Communists, Liang held him captive, but eventually he was freed by the Communists' intervention
 atah chini lokmat kii ichha ko dekhte hue chyang ne samvaadiyon ke saath baatcheet aarambh kii or 1937 main ek samjhauta kiya taaki sammilit prayaas karte hue japan ke prabhutv ko nasht kiya ja sake
 According to the agreement, the Communists' rule over the Shenxi and Kangsu provinces of northwestern China was accepted and the communist army was considered part of China's national army, which was to follow the orders of General Secretary Chiang Kai-shek against Japan
 is prakaar china main do pruthak-pruthak sarkaar is samay vidyaman thi
 Both had their own separate armies and both were ready to develop governance and social order according to their ideals in their respective regions
 yah samjhauta samyavaadiyon kii shakti ko badhaane main atyant mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In 1937, Japan invaded and defeated China and captured China
 nanking par japan kaa adhikaar ho jane se chyang kaai shaike ko peeche hatana padaa or pashchim main chungking ko apni rajdhani bananaa padaa
 On the other hand, the staunch Communists in the Shenxi province led an effective guerrilla fight against Japan in the north and presented themselves as patriotic nationalists to the people
 is kaaran japani atyaachaar se peedit kisaanon or madhyavarg kaa baari samarthan mila
 Meanwhile the Second World War started and the sino-japanese War became part of the Second World War
 us samay bhi chyang kaai shaike samyavaadiyon ko badhati shakti se chintit tha, japani akraman se nahin
 He gave more importance to China's internal politics than to the struggle against Japan
 atah samyavaadiyon tathaa kuomitanga ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti punah utpann ho gai
 With the onset of World War II, the sino-japanese War was influenced by american-british policies
 america or britain ne chyang kaai shaike ke sarkaar kii madad hetu vayuyan dwaara lakhon ton yuddh saamagree pahunchaai taaki japan yaa rus kaa prabhaav china main na bade
 In fact, a major reason for America's and Britain's interference in China's internal affairs was their opposition to communist ideology
 britain va america china main grihayuddh ko rokna chaahate the kyonki grihayuddh kii sthiti main shaktishaalee ho chuke samyavaadiyon kii vijay nishchit praayah najar aa rahi thi
 The United States and Britain entered into a treaty with Chungqing in 1943 to favor the Chiang Koi Shek government
 sandhi ke tahat china main in donon deshon ne apane visheshadhikaron ko tyaag diya or yah sweekaar kiya ki china raajnneetik drushti ke paashchaatya deshon ke samakaksh he or sansar kaa ek pramukh shaktishaalee rajya he
 The Allies, including the US, wanted the Chiang Kai-shek government of China to continue the war with Japan and not compromise with it
 saath hi vah samyavaadee sarkaar ke saath milakar japaniyon kaa muqabla kare
 Operationalized with this aim, the US, through General Steelwell and US Ambassador Hurley, tried to reach a compromise between Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists and confront the Japanese together, but the US failed and the agreement between the two Could not happen 1945 i
 main japan ne aatmasamarpan kar diya or dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa ant ho gaya, kintu china kii samasya kaa ant nahin hua
 In fact, Japan had control in Nanking and after the end of the war the problem arose whether the Kuomitang government of Chungqing occupied the occupied territories of the Nanking government or the Kuomitang government of Chungqing over the occupied territories of the communist government of Yenan province or the province of Yenan province
 Of the communist government, both parties went ahead to control Nanking
 atah china main punah grihayuddh kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 The US sent General Marshall in 1945 to negotiate a settlement between the two parties and to establish democracy to avert civil war
 marshall ke prayaason se 10 janvari 1946 ko yah samjhauta sampann hua
 According to the agreement, the party whose army has the right will be in the right of the same army, but this agreement was not permanent and civil war started on the rights of all the states
 samyavaadee sena ne uttari evam purvi china ke anek pradeshon par apana adhikaar sthapit kiya
 By January 1949, the Communists took control of Tintasin and Peking, and later Nanking, Shanghai Hanko and Canton, and on October 1, 1949, the Communists declared a "people's State" in Peking, and many countries including the Soviet Union Gave recognition to the communist government
 is prakaar china main samyavadi kranti safal hui
 The Kuomitang government of Chiang Kai-shek remained confined in the island of Parmosa
 america ne china kii samyavaadee sarkaar ko manyata na dekar formosa sthit rashtravaadi sarkaar ko china kii sarkaar ke rup main manyata di or apana sambandh banaae rakhaa
 In fact, the US could not openly support Chiang even though the US wanted in the conflict between the Communists and Chiang Kai-shek, because then Russia would have come in support of the Communists
 is dasha main america-rus ke bich pratyaksh sangharsh kii sambhaavna banati
 As a result, the United States often supported the policy of neutrality, and this made Chiang Kai-shek's political situation extremely weak
 1
 kuomitanga dal kii alokapriyata evam bhrasht shashan : chyang kaai shaike ke netritv main kuomitanga sarkaar bhrasht or nikammi thi
 He had nothing to offer to the public as an improvement
 unhone aise kisi kaarykram kii ghoshnaa nahin kii jisase vyapak jansamarthan hasil kiya ja sake
 Not only this, the Kuomitang government wasted most of its time protecting the interests of industrialists, bankers and landlords
 shashan main bhrashtachar vyaapt tha, janata ke upyog hetu laai gai saamagree nijee vyapaarik sadhano main prayukt ho rahi thi, aisi sthiti main sarkaar ne jansamarthan kho diya
 2
 Weaknesses of Military Organization and Military Strategy: The military weakness of the Kuomitang Dal was that there was a feeling of opposition to it that its top government employee was very corrupt and incompetent
 sainikon ko samay par vetan nahin miltaa tha
 The recruitment and promotion of soldiers was based on devotion rather than merit
 grihayuddh ke dauraan chyang ke sarkaar kii sainya kamajori evam ayogyata spasht ho gai vastutah chyang kii sena ne yuddh kaa sanchaalan bade-bade shaharon ko kendra bana kar kiya, parantu ye shahar samyavaadiyon dwaara chaaron ore se gher liye gaye
 In contrast, the communist army was efficient and efficient
 unhone gorilla paddati kii ranneeti apanaakar yuddh kiya, sena main anushaasan banaae rakhaa
 As a result, they succeeded against the nationalists
 3
 samaaj ke vibhinn virgon main saamaajik-aarthik asantosh : kuomitanga sarkaar dwaara kisaanon kii garibi ko dur karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya gaya
 The condition of the farmers suffering from drought and famine was poor, on the other hand, there was no shortage of food grains by the profiteers and merchants in the cities
 america prabhutv china main atyadhik tha or videshi poonjipati china kaa jamkar shoshan kar rahe the
 The Kuomitang government was unable to stop this exploitation
 faltah saamaanya janata sahit poonjipati varg ke log bhi sarkaar ke virdohi ho gaye
 In fact, the Kuomitang government did not offer any concrete socio-economic program to gain public support whereas the communists gained public support by presenting such a program
 4
 rashtravaadi sarkaar kaa samrajyavaadee shaktiyon ke saath sambandh : china kii rashtravaadi kuomitanga sarkaar kaa america jaise samrajyavaadee deshon ke saath sambandh tha
 The Chinese economy was operating from American economic imperialist policy
 china kii baking vyavastha par america bank kaa niyantran tha
 There was an excessive amount of American goods coming into China
 1848 tak yah maatra itani adhik ho gai thi ki china kii adhikansh audyogic ikaiyaan band ho gai or tamaam majdoor bekaar ho gaye
 This is the reason why the peasant-laborers etc
, dissatisfied with the policy of the government, supported the Chinese Communists in the civil war
 faltah samyavaadiyon ko safalataa mili
 5
 Chiang Kai-shek's short-sightedness: Chiang Kai-shek introduced short-sightedness in the Japanese invasion and relations with the Communists
 usne japani akraman ke khatre se kahin zyada bada khatra samyavaadiyon ko mana or samyavaadiyon ke daman kaa prayaas kiya
 While the Communists countered the Japanese invasion against China's interests and fought back in their territories, the Communists gained public support in this situation and the Communists succeeded in defeating Chiang Kai-shek in the Civil War

 Related Census Code: State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00719 uttar pradesh ke jile Lightning or "celestial lightning" is the discharge of electric charge into the atmosphere and the loudness produced by it is called lightning
 sansar main prativarsh lagbhag 1 karod 60 lakh tadit paidaa hote hai
 Probably, no other natural event would have generated so much fear, thrill and surprise, nor would it have done even today, as much as the lightning and thunder of the clouds
 anadi kaal se sansar ke praaia: sabhi deshon main yah vishwaas prachlit tha ki tadit ishwar kaa dand he, jiskaa prahaar vah us praani athwa vastu par karata he jiske upar vah kupit ho jaataa he
 The Greeks and Romans considered it to be the execution of the god Jupiter
 aaj bhi bahut se log aisa hi samajhate hai or tadit ke vaigyanik kaaran ko samajhane kii cheshtaa karne ke badale chirposhit andhvishwaas par hi adhik bharosa karte hai
 Many stories told in ancient scriptures emphasize his superstition
 vidyut sambandhi jaankariyon main kuch vruddhi hone par vaigyanikon kii yah dharna bani ki saadhaaran taur par tadit kii ghatana thik usee prakaar kii hoti he jaisaa sanghnitr ko anavisht karte samay uske platon ke bich vaayu main se hokar sphulingon kaa pravaah hota he
 No one had the courage to experiment to confirm this belief; But in the end, inspired by Benjamin Franklin, two French scientists, Dalibard and Delor, decided to carry out the experiment
 unhone dhaatu ke do chad liye
 Dalibard's rod was 40 feet and Delor's rod was 99 feet high
 donon hi chhadon se ve lagbhag dedh inch lambaai tak ke sphulingon kaa visarjan kara sakane main safal hue
 This experiment was very dangerous and later another scientist washed his life while repeating the same experiment
 phir bhi uparyukt prayog se yah nishchay na ho sakaa ki chado main utpann vidyut badalon se hi ai he, kyonki chhadon kii pahunch badalon tak nahin thi
 That's why Benjamin Franklin made his kiteboarding well-known experiment
 usne ek patang udayi or use badalon ke andar tak pahunchaaya
 As soon as the kite is drenched, both the kite and the door get tanned, which shows that both have become electrified
 us door main franklin ne ek chaabi band bhi di thi
 Taking the finger near the key led to the exhalation of the sphincters with the crackling sound of both
 itnaa hi nahin, us chaabi kaa sparsh leden jaar se karakar usne use aaweshit bhi kar liya
 This ensured that clouds also have electricity
 is vidyut ke sphuling rup main visarjan ko hi "tadit' kehete hai
 This immersion can occur between clouds and clouds, or between clouds and earth
 tadit praaia: kapasivarshi meghon main utpann hoti he
 These clouds have very strong upward wind currents, reaching a height of about 40,000 feet
 inamen kuch aisi kriyaayein hoti hai jinke kaaran inamen vidyut aaveshon kii utpatti tathaa viyojan hota rahata he
 For the explanation of these actions, Wilson, Simpson, Sucrez, etc
 have presented their theories, which seem to be conflicting, but all of them tell that the thirst of the thunder is in the clouds and for this, the watercourse existing in those clouds, or Precipitation particles, such as snowflakes, are responsible
 badalon main vidyudvitaran ke sambandh main bhi sabhi ekamat hai ki inke upree str dhanavisht tathaa madhya or nimnastar rinavishti hoten hai
 The division of these charges is also well above the zero degree c temperature levels inside the clouds
 isse yah nishkarsh sahaj hi praapt hota he ki aveshvibhaajan meghon main bananevaale himakanon tathaa urdhvagami pavandhaaraon se hi hota he, jal kii boondon se nahin
 Sometimes, even in low levels, there becomes a center of positive charges
 badalon ke nimna staron par rinvesh utpann ho jane ke kaaran neeche prithvi ke tal par preran dwaara dhanavesh utpann ho jate hai
 As the clouds move forward, these positive charges on the earth also move in the same way
 rinaveshon ke dwaara aakarshith hokar bhootal ke dhanavesh prithvi par khadi suchalak yaa ardhchaalak vastuon par upar tak chadh jate hai
 By this method, when the electrification of the clouds reaches the limit that the voltage gradient between the neighboring charges reaches the fractional value, then the dissolution of the electromagnet is in the form of long sphulings
 ise tadit kehete hai
 The lightning that comes towards the Earth reaches through several stages
 badalon se electranon kaa ek hillol 1 micro second main 50 meter neeche aata he or ruk jaataa he
 After about 50 Ma to 0, the second sequence starts, and in the same way, this wave reaches the earth at the end
 ise pramukh aghat kehete hai
 It takes a total time of 0
002 seconds to reach the Earth from its origin
 uparyukt tathy shonland tathaa unke sahyogiyon dwaara atyant sugrahi camere kii sahaayta se liye gaye photo chitra se prakat hue the
 On the same photo plaque, it was also shown that at the moment of reaching the earth, a very bright light went from the earth towards the clouds in the same order through which the main sequence came
 ise pratigaami apaat kehete hai
 While the average velocity of the principal sequence is 105 m per second, the velocity of the retrograde half is 107 m per second, because its path is already paved due to ionization
 uparyukt pramukh or pratigaami aghaton ke baad bhi kai aghat kramash:- neeche or upar kii ore aate-jate dikhalaai padate hai
 These are called secondary shock
 neeche aanevaale ye dwitiyak aghat pramukh aghat kii bhanti kramon main nahin aate
 CF Wagner and GD mccann have stated that the potential of clouds is often of the order of two million volts
 simpasan or scrage ne prayogon dwaara yah nishkarsh praapt kiya ki 10,000 foot kii oonchaai par sthit badalon ke vibhav kaa praaia: 50 se 100 volt prati senmi0 kii dar se patan hota he
 In the middle of the lightning process, the value of electrification varies from two to fifteen thousand amperes
 is prachand dhara ke kaaran tadit ke path main vidypan vaayu ke anu or parmaanu ynit ho jate hai or prakaash utpann karte hai
 This glow is visible to us as Damini
 yah spasht he ki vaayu se hokar badalon or prithvi ke bich vidyudvisarjan vahiin adhik sambhavya hoga jahaan vidyut ko vaayu kaa pratirodh kam se kam paar karnaa padegaa
 That is why lightning occurs mostly on high towers, tall buildings, solitary trees and flag bearers etc
 One of the reasons for this is that the closer the object is to the cloud, the greater the charge will be generated on it
 iske atirikt sapaat maidan kii apeksha minaaron, vrikshon kii chotiyon aadi ke nukile hone ke kaaran un par vidyut aavesh adhik maatra main ekatra hota he
 Traumatic electronegativity is one-way
 aghat ke lagabhaag paanch microsecond kii avadhi main hi iskaa maan ghaateey kram se badhata hua adhiktam ho jaataa he or lagbhag 25 microsecond ke andar ghatakar aadha maatr rah jaataa he
 This strong current usually lasts 100 microseconds
 iske pashchaat kramash: ghatati hui kuch sahastra ampiore tak pahunch jaati he or kuch sahasrashan second tak aisi hi bani rahati he
 If the stroke does not recur, then this stream becomes less and less
 saamanyatya tadit teen prakaar kii hoti he: Wide lightning occurs over a wide area and its continuous light spreads far enough over the clouds
 dharidaar yaa rekhawarna tadit aksar dikhalaai padati he
 It has one or more luminosities, straight or crooked, visible moving here and there
 isamen vidyudvisarjan badal se badal main, badal se dharti main athwa badal se vayumandal ke bich hota
 This light itself can be of three types: kanduk tadit ek jyotirmaya gend kii bhanti prithvi kii or aati hui dikhalaai padati he
 Its average diameter is 20 cm
 jyon-jyon vah prithvi kii ore agrasar hoti he, iskaa veg ghatata jaataa he
 After appearing for about three to five seconds, she explodes with a very loud sound
 yah bahut hi kam dikhalaai padati he or isaki utpatti kaa kaaran agyaat he
 The lightning barrage system developed by Benjamin Franklin is the best way to protect buildings from the direct trauma of lightning
 lohe kaa ek chad, jiskaa upree sira bhaale kii bhanti nukila hota he or bhawan ke kaaphi upar tak niklaa rahata he, bhawan ke parshv se hota hua bhoomi ke andar kaaphi gaharaai tak gada rahata he
 The lower end is placed in a copper plate in the ground
 yah tadit dand badal main vidyaman tadit ke liye nunatam pratirodh kaa maarg hi nahin prashast karata, pratyut yah bhawan par utpann prerit vidyudaveshon ko tatkaal prithvi ke andar pahunchaa detaa he
 Thus it also significantly reduces the possibility of mutual attraction of charges between clouds and the building
 ateet se hi vidyut jhanjhaaon ke dinon main, navik apane jalayanonke mastulon se is prakaar badalon ke vidyut kaa ksharan dekhte chale aa rahe hai
 This corrosion appears more clear at night
 ise europea navik sant almo kii agni kehete hai
 Many lightning-related experiments are being carried out these days
 ek manoranjak prayog motorcar main ek vyakti ko baitaakar or us motor par kritrim tadit upar se neeche kii ore bhejkar kiya gaya
 Since the electrons present in lightning, due to the same charge, have mutual distraction, they fall apart as they fall on the roof of the motorcar and pass through its walls into the earth below
 isse motor ke andar unki paith na ho saki or vah vyakti sarvatha surakshit rah gaya
 From this experiment, it is decided that in modern metal-framed buildings, whose foundation is very deep, the person sitting is very safe from the lightning strikes
 yadi aise bhawan, athwa taditchaalkayukt bhawan, na mil saken to aise vishaal bhawan main aashray lenaa chahie jo kaaphi vistrut ho
 During a thunderstorm, you should keep yourself away from power, stoves and other conductors of electricity
 baahar rahanewaalon ko pahadiyon ke upar, puaal ityadi ke dher par, ekaaki vrikshon ke neeche, pataakadandon ke paas, athwa kisi prakaar kii dhaatunirmit vastu ke sameep, kabhi na rahanaa chahie, na dhaatu se bani kisi vastu ko hi haath main liye rahanaa chahie
 Living in dense forests or under a sloping hill, it is absolutely safe
 yah aisi vyavastha hoti he jisamen apane upar aropit vibhav ko tatkshan gata dene kaa vishesh gun hota he
 It also prevents an increase in the intensity of the lightning current flowing through it
 isamen saadharantaya ek aantar vyavastha hoti he, jo ek pratirohak se shreneekram main sambhddha hoti he
 Its resistance decreases as the value of the current flowing in it increases
 antar yukti kaa kaary yah hota he ki vah araikhik pratirohak ko prayavarti dhara ke shaktiparipath se sthoolt: pruthak rakhti he
 The contact between these two is possible only when such a high voltage is generated which also makes the air of empty space conductive
 is prakaar tadit dhara prayavarti dhara ke shakti paripath ko kshati pahunchaae bina nirodhak se hokar prithvi ke andar sakushal pahunchaati he

 great den ke liye sho-sweekaarya aavaran rang chah hai: Sometimes other colors also come, but they are not acceptable for confirmation display and are not used by breeders who breed dogs for display
 These colors include white, fonequin, merle, merlequin, fawn, mantle, and others
 kuch prajnak in "durlabh" rangon vaale pillon ke liye adhik keemat maangane kaa prayaas kar sakate hai
 However, white and marley dens are particularly controversial because these colors may be related to genes that cause deafness
 haalanki unhen pradarshit nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin phir bhi safed or marle denon ko saamanytah is nasl ke kutton ke rup main panjikrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The Great Dane's large and elegant appearance proves its friendly behavior false; This breed is often cited as a cultured giant
 anya kutton, gaiyr-shwaneey paaltu pashuon or manushyon ke saath saamanytah great den acchhee tarah vyavhaar karte hai
 Some members may chase or attack small animals, but this is not a distinguishing feature of this breed
 adhikansh kutton kii tarah, great den ko bhi swasth rahane ke liye pratidin tahalne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 However, it is important that dogs of this breed are not over-exercised, especially when they are small
 Great Dane puppies grow to great size and very fast, which puts them at risk for joint and bone problems
 ek pille kii prakritik urja ke kaaran, den ke maalik aksar us dauraan gatividhiyon ko nunatam karne ke liye kadam uthaate hai, jabaki kutta abhi bhi bad rahaa hota he
 Like most big dogs, the Great Dane's metabolism is very slow
 iskaa parinaam choti naslon kii tulana main kute ke prayek pound bhaar ke liye kam urja or kam bhojan khapat ke rup main miltaa he
 Great Danes have some health problems, including gastric dilation-valvulus, which are common in large breeds
 yah ek gambhir sthiti he, jo great denon or gahare-seenevaali anya naslon ko prabhavit kar sakati he or jaldi dhyaan na diye jane par iskaa parinaam mrityu bhi ho saktaa he
 Consuming large amounts of fluids in short intervals of time can increase GDV in Great Danes as well as other large breeds of dogs
 yah great denon ke liye aamtaur par sujhai janevaali paddati he ki yadi kute yaa uske rishtedaaron main GDV kaa itihaas rahaa ho, to uske pet ko dahini udariy diwaar ke saath baandh diya jaae, haalanki yadi vaastavik beemaari utpann na hui ho, to kuch pashu-chikitsa sarjan yah oparation nahin karenge
 saamanytah aisa mana jaataa he ki bhojan kii thaaliyon ko oonche sthaan par rakhana khate samay grahan kii jaani vaali hawa kii maatra par niyantran rakhkar GDV ko rokane main sahaayta karata he, haalanki ek adhyayan ke anusaar aisa karne se khatara or bad saktaa he
 Staying away from any exercise or activity immediately before or immediately after a meal can also potentially reduce the risk, although this has not been confirmed by any research
 GDV kii upasthiti kii sambhaavna ke sanketon main pratyaksh sujan or baar-baar ulti karne ke gaiyr-utpaadak prayaason ke samaan dikhaai dene vaali oobakaai aana shaamil hai, lekin ye sanket yaheen tak simit nahin hai
 GDV is a condition that is different from another condition referred to as inflammation; However, GDV may develop after inflammation
 GDV ek shalyakriyaatmak apaat-sthiti he; yadi kute main is sthiti ke lakshan dikhaai den, to turant pashu-chikitsakeey jaanch karwaai jaani chahie
 Slipping of hip bones is another common problem of this breed
 vishishtatah abhibhavakon kaa ek eks-re yah pramanit kar saktaa he ki unke kuulhe swasth hai yaa nahin or yah is baat ke liye ek disha-nirdesh ke rup main kaary kar saktaa he ki kya is pashu kaa prajnan karavaaya janaa chahie or uske dwaara swasth pillon ko janm diye jane kii sambhaavna he yaa nahin
 wobler rog bhi is nasl kii ek samasya ho saktaa he, saamanytah yah kramik rup se badhata he or 2 varsh se kam aayu ke kutton main sabase pehle dikhaai detaa he
 It is considered genetic and although it is curable, prognosis is often safe
 saamanytah great den 8-10 varshon tak jite hai, lekin jimmedaar prajnan or paushtikta main vruddhi ke saath ve 12-14 varshon tak bhi ji sakate hai
 Dialated cardiomyopathy and many other congenital heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Danes, making them nicknamed the heartbreaking breed due to their short lifespan
 great den anek genetic vikaron se bhi grast hote hai, jo is nasl ke liye vishisht hai
 For example, if a Great Dane lacks any color near the eyes or ears, that organ does not develop and usually the dog will be blind, deaf, or both
 aisa bataaya jaataa he ki great den kaa vikaas mastiff-jaise kutton se hua tha, jo ailnon dwaara germany le jaae gayi the
 According to Barbara Stein, "the breed originated in Germany, possibly because of a hybrid between the English mastiff and the Irish Wolfhound
" " haalanki anya strot is baat par kaayam hai ki yah nasl denmark main janmi or kuch anya log abhi bhi is report ko vivaadaaspad or anishchit maanakar is par prashn-chinh lagaate hai
 In 1749, georges-louise Leclercque, Comte de Buffon used the name "le Grand Danois"
 Until then, hunting dogs in England were referred to as "danish dogs"
 jaikab nichole wilse ke anusaar denmark ke nivasee is kute ko "bada shikari kutta" kaha karte the, yah shabdaawalee 20veen sadi main bhi acchhee tarah jari rahi

 vikipedia ke mukh prishth ke liye, vikipedia kaa mukhya prishth dekhen
 For visitor introduction to Wikipedia, see page about Wikipedia
 vikipedia ek muft, web aadhaarit or sahyogi bahubhashi vishwakosh he, jo gaiyr-laabh vickemedia foundation se sahyog praapt pariyojna main utpann hua
 Its name is a combination of the two words Wiki and Encyclopedia
 duniya bhar main swayamsevakon ke dwaara sahyog se vikipedia ke 13 million lekh likhe gaye hai or iske lagbhag sabhi lekhon ko vah koi bhi vyakti sampadit kar saktaa he, jo vikipedia websit kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 It was started in January 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, currently the most popular reference work on the Internet
 vikipedia ke aalochak ise vyavasthit purvaagrah or asangatiyon ko doshi tehraate hai, or aarope lagate hai ki yah isaki sampadakeey prakriya main uplabdhiyon par sahmati kaa paksh leti he
 The reliability and accuracy of Wikipedia is also an issue

 Jonathan d of the New York Times, and Andrew Leah, in the fifth International Symposium on Online Journalism, described the importance of Wikipedia not only in the context of an encyclopedia but also as a frequently updated news source because it was recently Offers a very quick article about the events in jab time patrika ne you ko varsh 2006 ke liye person of da year kii manyata di or bataaya ki duniya bhar main kai million upyogkartaaon ke dwaara iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he or online sahyog main isaki badhati safalataa ko manyata di, isane web 2

 Wikipedia began as a complementary project to Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed as part of a formal process
 nupedia kii sthapana 9 march 2000 ko ek web portal company bomis, ink ke swaamitv ke tahat kii gayi
 Its main members were Jimmy Wales, Bomis CEO and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief of Nupedia and later Wikipedia
 prarambh main nupedia ko iske apane nupedia open content license ke tahat license diya gaya or richard stallmen ke suzav par vikipedia kii sthapana se pehle ise GNU ke muft documentation license main badal diya gaya

 On 10 January 2001, Larry Sanger proposed the Nupedia mailing list to produce a wiki as a "feeder project" for Nupedia
 vikipedia ko aupchaarik rup se 15 janvari 2001 ko, www
wikipedia
com par ekmaatr angreji bhashaa ke sanskaran ke rup main shuru kiya gaya

 vikipedia kii "neutral point of vyuu" kii niti ko iske praarambhik maheenon main sanketabaddh kiya gaya, ore yah nupedia kii praarambhik "pakshpaatahin" niti ke samaan thi
 Otherwise, initially there were relatively few rules and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia
 vikipedia ne nupedia se praarambhik yogadanakarta praapt kiye, ye the sleshdot posting or search ingine indexing
 By the end of 2001, it had nearly 20,000 articles and 18 language editions
 2002 ke ant tak iske 26 bhashaaon ke sanskaran ho gaye, 2003 ke ant tak 46 or 2004 ke antim dinon tak 161 bhashaaon ke sanskaran ho gaye
 Nupedia and Wikipedia were present together until the former's server was permanently down in 2003 and its text was moved to Wikipedia

 Due to lack of control and perceived commercial advertising in an alleged English-focused Wikipedia, Spanish Wikipedia users split from Wikipedia in February 2002 to form Enciclopedia Libre
 baad main usee varsh, wales ne ghoshit kiya ki vikipedia vigyapanon kaa pradarshan nahin karegaa or isaki websit ko wikipedia

 Hence predators rarely go in such arid regions
 vastav main "nilgai" is praani ke liye utana sarthak naam nahin he kyonki maadaaen bhure rang kii hoti hai
 Blueness is found in adult male color
 vah lohe ke samaan saleti rang kaa athwa dhoosar nile rang kaa shandaar jaanavar hota he
 His front legs are longer and athletic than the previous leg, with his back sloping backwards
 nar or maadaa main gardan par ayaal hota he
 There is a long and thick bunch of white hair on the neck of the males and a white bandage below the knees on its feet

 Even on bumpy ground, she can run far and fast like a horse

 Nilgai have males and females wandering in separate herds most of the time
 akele ghoomte nar bhi dekhe jate hai
 They are driven out of the herd by more powerful males
 maadaaon ke jhund main chhaune bhi rahete hai
 Nilgai may appear to be a safe creature, but males are extremely quarrelsome
 ve maadaaon ke liye aksar lard padate hai
 Their way of fighting is also unique
 apni qamar ko kaman kii tarah upar kii ore modakar ve dhire-dhire ek-duusare kaa chakkar lagaate hue ek-duusare ke najadik aane kii cheshtaa karte hai
 On coming closer, they sit on the knees of the front legs and push each other with their long and sturdy necks
 yon apni gardanon ko uljhaakar ladate hue ve jirafon ke samaan lagate hai
 The more powerful male tries to strike his sharp horns at the backside of his opponent
 jab kamjor nar bhaagane lagata he, to vijayi nar apni jhaadu-jaisi poonch ko hawa main jhande ke samaan fahraate hue or gardan ko jhukaakar maidan chhodkar bhaagate pratidwandvi ke peeche daud padataa he

 Nilgai makes very little sound, but the female is sometimes similar to a buffalo
 nilgai saal ke kisi bhi samay joda baandhti he, par mukhya prajnan samay november-janvari hota he, jab naron kii neeli jhiwali khaal sabase sundar avasthaa main hoti he
 After mating, the males separate from the females and form their own herd

 The herds of females have 10–12 members, but the males migrate to larger herds, which can have up to 20 males
 inamen chote chhaunon se lekar vayask naron tak sabhi umron ke nar hote hai
 These males are very quarrelsome and keep trying repeatedly with each other
 jab jhagadne ke liye koi nahin miltaa to ye apane singon ko jhaadiyon main athwa jameen par hi de maarthe hai
 Nilgai is extremely vigilant when grazing or sleeping
 sustaane ke liye vah khuli jameen chunati he or ek-duusare se peeth sataakar letati he
 Thus, while lying down, one member of the herd keeps a watch on every direction
 koi khatra dikhne par vah turant khadaa ho jaataa he or dabi aawaaj main pukaarane lagata he
 Chhauns are born in September – October when the height of the grass is high enough to hide them
 ye chhaune paidaa hone ke aath ghante baad hi khadey ho pate hai
 Sometimes twins are born
 chhaunon ko jhund kii sabhi maadaaen milakar paalati hai
 When hungry, Chhaun goes to any female and drinks milk

 iqbaal unase vinati karata hai ki meraa sho dekho agar aapako pasand aae to karz chukaane ke liye kuch or mohalat de dena
 The representative would order the circus to be closed even after watching his show
 iqbaal kaa chota sa betaa sahir bhi unase vinati karata hai par wo nahin maanate
 Iqbal commits suicide in front of everyone by saying "bankers are like you", which causes his little son to panic
 kai saalon baad sahir ab bhi wo ghatana nahin bhuulaa hai or wo bank waalo se badla lene kii thaanta hai
 He steals several branches of Western Bank of Chicago and runs away using his circus acrobatics by writing "bank Valo Tumhari Aisi Ki Tasi" in Hindi
 kyonki chicago police use nahin pakad paa rahi hai or unhen hindi bhi nahin aati isliye wo bhartiya police main se asipi jai dikshit or uske sahyogi ali ko madad ke liye bulaate hai
 In order to get Jai Sahir knowingly, he spreads the matter that he is handling this case and he feels that the thieves are definitely an amateur
 isse sahir chori karne kii thaanta hai, wo ek samachar channel se is yojana ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karata hai or jai ke liye mumbir banane kaa naatak karata hai
 In this way they gather information about the bank and give Jai a clue to go back
 antat: sahir bank main chori kar letaa hai or motorcical pe bhaagane lagata hai, jai usko goli martha hai par sahir bhaag jane main safal ho jaataa hai
 Sahir premieres the revamped version of the Great Indian Circus, along with his female colleague Aaliya, which includes a trick with him to vanish from one place and appear at another
 sho safal hota hai, lekin baad main jai, ali or police use chaaron ore se gher leti hai, jaanate hue ki wo chor hai
 Jai says that the evidence is the bullet wound, but when Sahir is examined, there is no bullet mark anywhere on his body
 jai or ali sarkas se chale jate hai jabaki sahir apane kamare main chalaa jaataa hai
 Here it is revealed that Sahir has a twin brother, Samar, who helps him in his circus tricks and bank robbery and it was Samar who was shot

 karl marks tathaa maiks webar ke saath ve bhi aadhunik samaaj vigyaan ke mukhya shilpi evam samajashaastra ke janak kahe jate hai
 David Emile Durkheim is considered the founder of modern sociology and the first official sociologist in the world in sociological terms
 adhyayan kii vishvavidhyalayan vyavastha main ve samajashaastra ke pehle profesar bhi the
 In the three decades of his academic life, he not only established sociology as a specific discipline, but also laid the theoretical and methodological ground of this discipline
 durkhime kii samajashastreey sankalpana kaa vidheyak tatva manushya ko saamaajik sambandhon kaa parinaam maanata he
 For this reason Durkheim's sociology refuses to recognize any form of individualism in its infrastructure
 manushya kii iyatta ko samaaj kii upaj maanane ke sandarbh main durkhime comt, marks, webar aadi saamaajik chintakon ke nazadik baithte hai
 It is important to consider that the person is the product of the society and giving central importance to the social phenomenon itself gives sociology a distinct form compared to other disciplines
 samajashaastra kii yah vishistataa durkhime ke bina sambhav nahin thi
 Although Durkheim has also thought intensively on issues ranging from thinkers like Montescue and Rousseau to pragmatism, socialism and moral education, his four works in the field of sociology - 'the Division of Labor', 'the Rules of Socioeconomic Method', ' Suicide 'and' The Elementary Forms of the Release's Life 'are considered most important
 david emil durkhime kaa janm apinal, loren ke ek francisi yahudee parivaar main hua tha
 Both his father and grandfather were rabbis
 unki shuruaati shiksha bhi ek dharmik skool main hui, lekin jivan ke shuru main hi unhone puri tarah se secular jivan guzaarane kaa nishchay kiya
 As an undergraduate student, he enrolled in the renowned Ecol Normale Superiorie and in 1886, as part of his doctorate, he created 'the Division of Labor in Society'
 is rachana main durkhime aadhunik or parmparik samaajon kaa fark dikhaate hue yah pratipaadit karte hai ki aadhunik samaaj jahaan shram ke vishesheekaran par aadhaarit hota he vahiin parmparik samaaj saajhe vishwaason par chalata he
 According to him, this difference of forms of society also reflects the difference in the system of rules
 is tarah aadhunik samaaj swa- niyaman se sanchalit hota he jabaki parmparik samaaj ke niyam bahari vishwaason or anumodan par tike hote hai
 According to Durkheim, since shared beliefs rest on the authority of common morality, a system based on these beliefs can only be sustained through power and pressure
 jabaki swaniyamkaari yaa aadhunik samaaj swatantraaa, samanta tathaa nyaay jaise tattvon ke bina santulit nahin rah saktaa
 Scholars believe that this formulation of looking at the diversity of social forms by linking them to specific frameworks of rules has been a fundamental driving force for sociological studies of crime and law
 durkhime maanate the ki samaaj ke parmparik or aadhunik roopon main vibhram ke kaaran tathaa aadhunik samaajon par parmparik kanoon yaa niyam thopane kii pravriti hi kai saamaajik samasyaon ke liye jimmedaar rahi he
 This interpretation of modern societies is considered a distinct achievement of Durkheim's work
 is rachana main durkhime vyakti ke saamaajik saahchary yaa judaav kaa vishleshan karte hue yah vichaar bhi rakhte hai ki vyakti ko khaas tarah kii saamaajik saahchary kii zarurat padati he
 Durkheim shows that within social institutions there is an element of self which demands a certain behavior from its partners
 durkhime isiilie is baat par jor dete the ki vyakti ke bajaay saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 According to him the concrete form of these social processes is expressed in institutions and behavior which can also be studied on the basis of monitoring
 durkhime in prakriyaaon ko soshal facts yaa saamaajik tathyon kii sangya dete hai
 Durkheim is also credited with the creative use of statistics in sociological studies
 is sambandh main unki rachana suiside ek maanak kii tarah sthapit he
 In this work Durkheim proposed that different rates of suicide can be interpreted on the basis of differences in the individual's levels of social affiliation
 masalan, unhone dikhaaya ki vyakti kii nijee pravritiyon ke aadhaar par is baat kaa andaaza nahin lagaaya ja saktaa ki umrdaraj purush hi kyon aatmahatya karte hai
 But if the factors of a person's social status such as his being unmarried or his isolation from society, etc
, the cause of suicide can be identified
 durkhime apane adhyayan main sankhyikee kaa istemaal saamaajik tathyon jaise kisi samooh ke sadasyon ke aapasi saahchary ke roopon kii takat yaa charitra ujagar karne ke liye karte hai
 For example, if the feeling of mutual companionship is weak in a group, then there will be more chances of moral or psychological problems in its members
 iske ulat agar kisi samooh main saahchary kii bhaavana bahut gahari ho to uske sadsy apane samooh ke liye tyaag karne ke liye zyaada tatpar paye jaaenge
 Durkheim's other work, 'the Rules of Socioecological Method', is considered to be the cornerstone of the methods used in sociology
 is rachana main durkhime spasht karte hai ki samajashaastra kii kendriya vishay- vastu saamaajik vyavastha he, lihaaza usamen vyakti ke bajaay samaaj ke saansthanik or vyavasthaagat roopon ko pramukhataa di jaani chahie
 In this composition Durkheim describes sociology as a study of such social facts
 unke anusaar in saamaajik tathyon ke bich ek khaas tarah kii sangati hoti he jise keval unke nirmaankari anshon kaa sanchit parinaam nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In his work Suicide, Durkheim wanted to clarify the same point that even a private phenomenon like suicide can be explained on the basis of people's associative relationships and social bonding
 unki daleel thi ki vyakitgat bhavanaaen, mulya yaa vichaar jaisi chijen vastav main saamaajik sahabhaagita se hi upajati hai
 Durkheim's two compositions, 'the Division of Labor' and 'the Elementary Forms of the Religious Life', are known to use modern approaches to the then social order
 aadhuniktaa ke samajashastreey vimarsh main ye donon rachanaayen apane baarik or saghan adhyayan ke kaaran aaj bhi ek anivaary sandarbh bani hui hai
 Durkheim's contemplation was modern in a deep sense
 froid jaise manovishleshak bhi apane samay ke purvagrahon se mukt nahin ho paye the or apni kriti totum and tabu main aadim dimaag kii tulana maansik rogi se kar baithe the, jabaki durkhime ne apni rachana alementary forms of da relijas life main yah pratipaadit kiya ki tarkbuddhi ke lihaaz se aadim kabeelon kii saamaajik sanrachanaayen or vishwaas aadhunik manushya kii tarkbuddhi se kamatar nahin tehraye ja sakate
 This was a bold idea given the political ramifications prevailing in Durkheim's time
 chunki durkhime tarkbuddhi ko saamaajik utpaada maanate hai isiilie manushya ko kamatar yaa shreshthatar sabit karne vaale vichaar ko ve sire se kaarij kar dete hai
 Durkheim's intervention has equipped sociology with a basic egalitarianism
 ukt rachana main dharm kii saamaajik upyogita par vichaar karte hue durkhime yah daleel pesh karte hai ki manushya dharmik reeti-rivaazon tathaa karmkandon main bhagidaari ke zariye hi maanviya tarkbuddhi ke buniyadi roopon- spes, samay, vargeekaran, shakti, kaary-kaaran kii samaj tathaa sampoornataa kaa bodh arjeet karata he
 Durkheim also introduces the idea that the social experience of purity gives rise to social interrelations
 unke mutabik saamaajik vyakti kaa janm tathaa tarkbuddhi kaa vikaas bhi isi prakriya se nirast hota he
 Durkheim also says in this work that all concepts originate from society
 isliye tark, bhashaa or arth kii samaj viksit karne ke liye is baat kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie ki shabdon or avadharanaon kaa kin saamaajik roopon or sandarbhon main istemaal kiya gaya he
 Here, Durkheim describes religion as a function of society and makes another important formulation that religion is a means of maintaining social order
 durkhime dharmik vishwaason kii satyata ko sidhe to nahin nakaarte lekin unke liye dharm kaa satya uski is kshamta se tay hota he ki vah karmkandon ko protsaahit kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 According to him, organized religions cannot be understood only on the basis of beliefs, because such religions are often found while suppressing personal faith to keep traditional forms of society intact
 aadhunik or parmparik samaajon main dharm kii bhoomika ko lekar durkhime kaa yah sutara bhi kaabile gaur he ki samaaj kii in do alag kismon main dharm ke prakaarya ek jaise nahin hote
 Religion is a tool of social control in traditional societies whereas in modern societies its function becomes non-essential because in modern societies it becomes a function of knowledge and epistemology
 isiilie saamaajik vyavastha main uski bhoomika pehle jaisi nahin rah jaati
 Durkheim's conclusion that sociopolitical thinking would be considered an achievement is that the phenomenon of a human being transforming from a biological being to a social animal cannot be explained on the basis of one's biological abilities or psychology
 unki daleel he ki jaivik kaa saamaajik main roopantaran saamaajik prakriyaaon ke madhyam se sampann hota he
 Therefore, Durkheim feels that the opinion that the mind and body are called two separate rights, only shows the difference between biological existence and social animal standing outside the process of society
 unke anusaar pehali avasthaa ke praani ko rashnal manushya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 They also emphasize that in human beings, things like rationality or personality arise from the process of society itself
 durkhime kaa mat tha ki manushya ko ek saamaajik praani ke rup main banaaye rakhane ke liye saamaajik prakriyaaon or saahchary ke khaas roopon kii darkaar hoti he
 That is, a social man cannot be seen apart from his fixed social configuration and context
 isliye durkhime aagaah bhi karte hai ki agar manovigyaan, arthshaastra yaa darshanashastra ke adhyayan kii koi paddati saamaajik parighatna ko keval vyaktiyon kii sanchit gatividhiyon ke aadhaar par samajhane kaa upkram karti he to use samaaj jaise sabase mahatvapurn paksh ko darkinar karne kaa doshi samajha janaa chahie
 hgfrtew Despite egalitarianism's apparent reputation in Durkheim's contemplation and work, feminist analysts say she has not paid enough attention to the issue of women
 ek had tak yah baat sahi he ki samajashastri ke taur par durkhime kii koi bhi rachana stri-paksh par ekagra nahin he
 But at the time of the nineteenth century when Durkheim was organizing sociology, very few social thinkers were considering the questions of women
 suiside main unhone aatmahatya kii ek bhagyavaadee kism kaa zikr kiya he jise ve mukhyatah striyon ke saath jod kar dekhte hai
 Durkheim also thought that marriage is beneficial for men but it has a negative effect on the lives of women
 da divizan of lebar main durkhime muulavaasiyon ke hawaale se bataate hai ki aise samudaayon main striyon kii saamaajik sthiti purushon ke mukaable kamatar nahin thim jabaki iske ulat aadhunik samaajon main stri kii haisiyat kamazor hoti gayi he
 The average tendency of erstwhile society portrayed the woman as soft and weak
 ise dekhte hue durkhime kii drushti nishchay hi agragami kahi jaaegi
 Durkheim's contribution has been a matter of inspiration, questioning, inclusion and cross-examination for many generations of sociologists
 tees ke dashak main talcott parcens ne durkhime ke krititv ko sanrachanaatmak prakaaryawad main sametane kaa prayaas kiya
 As a result, Durkheim's contribution to America began to be viewed through formalism and positivism
 jabaki frans main unki drushti kaa levi-stros jaise maanavshastriyon ne upyog kiya jinaki dilchaspee durkhime dwaara pratipaadit sankalpanaaon, vichaaron or samaaj ke antarsambandhon ke aadhaar par ek pratikwaadi maanavshaastra rachane main thi
 But this venture to make a new interpretation based on Durkheim's ideas proved to be one-sided in that he used only certain parts of Durkheim's original preface
 marxvaadi dhara ke samajashastriyon ne apane lekhan main durkhime ke chintan main nihit radical swaroop ko mahatva dete hue parcens ke drushtikon ko pratisantulit karne kaa prayaas kiya he jo durkhime ko raajnneetik rup se roodhiwaadee sabit karne par jor detaa he
 a group of sociologists believe that Durkheim's sociology is secondary to the individual
 lekin dhyaan se dekhen to durkhime aisa iradatan karte hai
 His vision urges society to be understood as collectivism and emphasizes that the basic aim of sociology is to be synonymous with individualism if it does not pay attention to the investigation of social theories and the study of contradictions in the practice of sociology
 Is canceled
 durkhime ke tain samajashaastra kaa kaam yah nahin he ki vah darshanashastreey sandhan ke liye kachi saamagree muhaiyaa karaaye or phir is baat kaa intazaar kare ki darshanikon kaa khemaa apane moolyankan main kya kahata he
 On the other hand, Durkheim argues that sociology should formulate the criteria for the study of social facts
 unhone darshanashastriyon kii is daleel ko kaarij kar diya ki saamaajik tathyon main aakasmikta kaa tatva hota he
 While giving a well thought out response to this criticism, Durkheim said that certain types of and permanent forms are necessary to maintain the continuity of society

 In the scriptures, Basant Panchami is mentioned from Rishi Panchami, then it is depicted differently in Puranas and Shastras and in many poems

 On the advice of Prithviraj's fellow poet Chandbardai, Ghori indicated by sitting on a high place, hitting the pan
 tabhi chandbardaai ne prithviraj ko sandesh diya
 Prithviraj Chauhan did not forget this time
 unhone tave par hui chot or chandbardaai ke sanket se anumaan lagaakar jo baan maaraa, vah mohammad gori ke seene main ja dhansa
 After this Chandrabardai and Prithviraj also surrendered by stabbing each other in the stomach
 yah ghatana bhi vasant panchami vaale din hi hui thi
 Vasant Panchami also has a deep connection with Veer reality in Lahore

 When the other children teased her, Durga's mother sang

 He stayed in Ranjit Singh's army for some time, then came home and got engaged in farming, but due to spiritual instincts, people started listening to his sermons
 dhire-dhire inke shishyon kaa ek alag panth hi ban gaya, jo kuka panth kahalaaya
 Guru Ram Singh used to place great emphasis on cow protection, Swadeshi, women salvation, inter-caste marriage, mass marriage etc
 unhone bhi sarvapratham angreji shashan kaa bahishkar kar apni swatantra dak or prashasan vyavastha chalaayi thi
 Every year a fair was held in Bhaini village on Makar Sankranti

 hamaare panchangon main utsavon or vraton ke atirikt grahan, suryodayast, isht ghatnaon ke samay, akaash main grahon kii sthiti ityadi khagoleey vishay die jate hai
 Astronomy has now come to such an advanced position in the West that at the time of astronomical events in the almanacs there are equal to seconds with the direct events of the celestial planets and here the mathematics of our almanacs has become so gross that in their eclipses a difference of up to one and a half hours is found
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jin granthon se hamaare panchang banate hai ve kam se kam 500 varsh puraane hai or in 500 varshon main pashchim main ganit jyotish main bahut unnati ho gai he
 With this, the arithmetic of our almanacs should be done with astrology, so that it can be accurate according to the direct sky
 aise ganit ko "pratyaksh" yaa "iktulya" ganit yaa "drugganit" kehete hai
 Today, in Gujarat and Maharashtra all almanacs are made by direct mathematics
 par bharat ke anyaanya pradeshon main pratyaksh ganit se bahut kam panchang banaae jate hai
 But only direct mathematics cannot solve the question of our almanacs
 hamaare panchang suryachandra kii akashiya sthiti ke anusaar banaae jate hai or inamen anya grahon kii sthiti bhi di rahati he
 The way to describe the situation is that the differences of planets are measured from a fixed point above a fixed line of the sky and these differences are given in almanacs
 us nishchit rekha ko "krantivrutt", nishchit bindu ko "aarambhsthaan" or vahaan se grah ke antar ko "bhoga" kehete hai
 The starting point of Westerns is definite and that is Vasant Samasat
 magar hamaare panchang kaa aarambhsthaan koun sa bindu ho, is vishay main hamaare panditon main bahut matbhed he
 The difference between Vasant Samasat and our starting point is called "ayanamsha"
 iskaa arth yah hua ki aynansh kitna he is vishay main hamaare panditon main matbhed he
 Without the determination of ayanamsha, the starting place is not determined and the almanac cannot be formed without the determination of the starting point
 at: aynansh hamaare panchang kii mahatvapurn samasya he
 Sion, Niryan - The almanac in which the spring is considered the starting point is called the "sion" almanac, and the almanac in which any point other than this property is considered as the starting point is called the "niryan" almanac
 vasantsampaat, dakshinyan, sharatsampat or uttarayan, ye chaar bindu krantivrutt ke upar anukram se 90-90 ansh ke antar se aae hai
 The Sun is stable, but the Earth revolves around the Sun in a year
 parantu hamen bhramavash aisa bhaasith hota he ki surya hi hamaare chaaron ore gum rahaa he
 This transcendental annual path of the Sun is called "revolution
" is maarg par surya ek varsh main pashchim se purv kii ore bhraman karata hua hamako dikhaai detaa he
 Two Sampat and two Ayan, these four points are not stable, but they are all going back to the west at a very small speed of 50 per annum
 rituen, din or raatri kaa badhanaa ghatana, in sab ghatnaon kaa aadhaar ye chaar bindu hai, arthath jab surya in binduon ke paas aata he, tab ye ghatnaayen hoti hai
 From this, seasons, days, etc
 are according to the year of sion
 sayan varsh kaa maan 365 diwas, 5 ghante, 48 minute or 46 second he
 The starting point of the Niryan Panchang can be any static or unstable point except Sampath
 isse jahaan sthir aarambhsthaan vivakshit ho, vahaan asandigdhta ke liye "nirayan" ke sthaan par "nakshatra" shabd kaa prayog karnaa adhik acha he
 However, the word "niryan" is used a lot in the sense of "nakshatra"
 taare sthir hai, isse surya kisi ek tara, yaa sthir bindu se chalakar jitne samay ke baad phir us sthir bindu yaa tara ke paas pahunche utane samay ko "nakshatra" varsh kehete hai
 The value of the sidereal year is 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and 10 seconds
 taare drishy or sthir hai, unke sambandh main grahon ke akashiya sthaan nakshatrapaddati se ham batala sakate hai
 This is a special use of the sidereal system
 sayan varsh nakshatra varsh se 20 minute or 24 second chota he
 In our old-fashioned almanacs, the Varshamana taken is 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes and 36 seconds
 yah na shuddh sayan he or na shuddh nakshatra
 It is about 24 minutes from the pure Sion year and about minutes from the pure sidereal year
 yah varshmaan lene ke kaaran hamaari rituen or taron ke bich main grahon ke sthaan, ye sab hamaare pratyaksh avlokan or anubhav se bhinn aate hai
 What should we do in such a situation? Before answering this question, it is necessary for us to know which topics come in our almanac
 panchang arthath paanch ang ye hai : tithi, waar, nakshatra, yoga or karan
 "tithi" tells the 15th part of the full moonbimb and "karan" the 30th part
