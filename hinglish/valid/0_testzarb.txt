 sinhalai bhashaa srilanka main boli jane vaali sabase badi bhashaa he
 Tamil is the most spoken language in Sri Lanka after Sinhalese
 praaia: aisa nahin hota ki kisi desh kaa jo naam ho, vahi us dash main basane vaali jati kaa bhi ho or vahi naam us jati dwaara vyavahrut hone vaali bhashaa kaa bhi ho
 The specialty of Sinhala island is that the caste settled in it has been called "sinhala" and the language used by that caste is also "sinhala"
 anek bhartiya bhashaaon kii lipiyon kii tarah sinhal bhashaa kii lipi bhi brahmi lipi kaa hi parivartit viksit rup hai or jis prakaar urdu kii varnmaala ke atirikt devanagari sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon kii varnmaala he, usee prakaar devanagari hi sinhal bhashaa kii bhi varnmaala he
 Sinhala language has two forms - Shuddha Sinhala and Mixed Sinhala shuddh sinhal ko keval battis akshar maanya rahe hai- The oldest grammar book of Sinhala (siddatsangra) holds that the quantity of ऍ and ai-a, and Aa are incremental quantities
 vartmaan mishrit sinhal ne apni varnmaala ko na keval paali varnmaala ke aksharon se samrudh kar liya he, balki sanskrit varnmaala main bhi jo or jitne akshar adhik the, un sab ko bhi apana liya he
 Thus the number of letters in the present mixed Sinhala is fifty four
 attharah akshar "swar" tathaa shesh chhattis akshar vyanjan maane jate hai
 When two letters are congruent, this process is called "pact"
 shuddh sinhal main sandhiyon ke keval das prakaar maane gaye hai
 But in modern Sinhala, the treaty or treaty of Sanskrit words is done according to the rules of Sanskrit grammar
 "ekakshar" athwa "anekaksharon" ke samooh padon ko bhi sanskrit kii hi tarah chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he - namay, aakhyaat, upsarg tathaa nipaat
 Like Hindi in Sinhala, there are two words - "singular" and "plural"
 sanskrit kii tarah ek atirikt "dwivachan" nahin hota
 The distinction of this "singular" and "plural" is called number distinction
 jis prakaar "vachan" ko lekar "hindi" or "sinhal" kaa samya he usee prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki "ling" ke vishay main bhi hindi or shuddh sinhal samandharma he
 There are only three men - first man, middle man and best man
 teenon purushon main vyavahrut hone vaale sarvanaamon ke aath kaarak hai, jinaki apni-apni vibhaktiyaan hai
 The "karan" factor is often counted after "karma", but the "karta" factor between "karma" and "karan" is counted among the eight factors of Sinhala
 "sambodhan" kaarak nahin hone se "kartri" kaarak ke baavjood karkon kii ginati aath hi rahati he
 The head of the sentence assumes "action", because no statement is formed in the absence of a verb
 yon sinhal vyakaran adhikansh baton main sanskrit kii anukriti maatr he
 Even then, there are neither "parasmappad" nor "atmanapada" like Sanskrit nor ten lotus etc
 sinhal main kriyaaon ke ye aath prakaar maane gaye hai- At the time of speaking and speaking the Sinhala language, like our Bhojpuri dialects, it is very easy in terms of suffixes, but equally difficult in writing and reading
 bolne-chaalane main yanava kriyaapad se hi jaataa hoon, jate hai, jaataa he, jate ho, jaataa he, jate hai ityadi hi nahin, jayega, jaaenge aadi sabhi kriyaswaroopon kaa kaam ban jaataa he
 Gender discrimination is considered as a zigzag for Hindi students
 sinhal bhashaa is drushti se badi saral he
 There you can use the word "hond" synonymous with the word "good" for both "boy" and "girl"
 prayek bhashaa ke muhaavarey uske apane hote hai
 It is useless to find their exact synonym in other languages
 to bhi anubhav samya ke kaaran do bhinn jatiyon dwaara boli jane vaali do bhinn bhashaaon main ek jaisi milti-julati kahavatein uplabdh ho jaati hai
 There is sufficient uniformity in Sinhala and some idioms and proverbs in Hindi

 Two hundred years after Lord Buddha's Parinirvana, Ashokaputra Mahendra reached Sinhala Island, according to "mahavansh" he preached in the island language to the people of Sinhala Island
 mahamati mahendra apane saath "buddhavachan" kii jo parampara laae the, vah maukhik hi thi
 That tradition must have been either a "magadhi" of Buddha's time, or a "prakrit" of two hundred years later that Mahendra Sthavira himself would have spoken
 sinhal itihaas kii manyata he ki mahendra sthavir apane saath na keval tripitak kii parampara laae the, balki unke saath uske bhashyon athwa uski atthakathaon kii parampara bhi
 Those chronicles were later translated into Sinhala

 uddeshy tha, europe ke us maanchitr ko punarvyavasthit karnaa jise nepolian ne apane yuddh or vijayon se ulat-patal diya tha
 In fact, Austria's Chancellor Metternich was instrumental in building a front against Napoleon, so on his initiative the Congress was called in Vienna, the capital of Austria

 ve mahaan raajnneetijna the
 Due to them, the conference of the Vienna Congress was held in Vienna, the capital of Austria
 iskaa pratham adhiveshan 15 sitambar 1814 ko hi aarambh ho chukaa tha
 The conference included the ruler of the Tsar Alkjender i of Prussia, Friedrich William III of Austria, the Tellerna of France, Metrénique, Austria, and the Foreign Minister of England, Lord Castlere, etc
 In which all the minor rulers of Europe except Turkey were present
 congress kii samasya- The Vienna Congress had many problems
 sarv pratham nepolian ke yudhon ke chalate europea maanchitr main kaaphi parivartan aa gaya tha
 The question of the restoration of these states before the Vienna Congress was the second problem was to suppress the revolutionary spirit
 carch kaa prashn bhi bahut badi samasya thi
 The members of Vienna wanted to reestablish the Church's influence
 chauthi samasya yuddh kii sambhaavna ko samaapt karnaa tha taaki pun: nepolian jaisaa koi shaktishaalee vyakti paidaa nahin ho sake
 Rewarding the conquered nations was another problem
 vienna congress ke siddhant evam uddeshy- The Vienna Congress had some principles for the solution of the above mentioned problems which are as follows
 shakti santulan kaa siddhant- Its main principle was the balance of power, that is, Holland could be extended to Switzerland, Baberia and Serdinia to ban France so that no country could become powerful enough to become dangerous to others
 france chaaron taraf se majboot rajyon se ghir gaya
 In the same way, Germany was made so powerful that the administration could not lift the head
 italy main austria kii sthapit kii gai is prakaar shakti santulan sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 So that power throughout Europe remains at peace
 vaidhata kaa siddhant- On the basis of this principle, the European map of 1789 was adopted by accepting the boundaries and attempting to demarcate various European states
 holland, purtegal, neples, tathaa italy aadi rajya anek puraane rajvansh ko lautaa diya gaya
 Principle of Damage Supply is siddhant ke anusaar jin deshon ko nepolian ne nasht kiya tha or jinhone uske khilaaf sangharsh kiya tha
 It was accepted to compensate and reward them
 jin deshon ne nepolian kaa saath diya tha
 He was punished
 france ke viruddh seemaant rajyon ko shaktishaalee bananaa-iskaa chauthaa siddhant france ke viruddh seemaant rajyon ko shaktishaalee banaaya jaae taaki france antarrashtriya shakti ko bhang nahin kar sake
 Apart from the above principles, it had other principles
 shanti- samjhauta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye iske peeche bhi shakti honi chahie
 Thus, England, Austria, Russia and Russia gave rise to the European system as a result of this principle of the four-pronged treaty
 vienna congress ke nirnay evam pradeshik vyavastha- The territorial system it established had the following objectives
 jin deshon ne nepolian ko haraane main hissaa liya tha unhen puraskaar or jo parajeet hue the unhen dand milanaa chahie
 In Europe, the system before the revolution should be implemented
 jisase europea vyavastha kaa nirmaan ho or shanti tathaa suraksha kaayam rakhaa ja sake
 The states that Napoleon included in France were taken away
 or france main pracheen rajvansh ko phir se sthapit kiya gaya
 England had colonial and trade benefits
 malta, saint, lucienna, morishas ke dweep france se lekar england ko de diya gaya
 Prasha also benefited by giving him the territories of Northern Saxony, Salasapel and Triale, as a result his kingdom doubled and gained influence in southern Germany
 belgium ko holend main shaamil kiya gaya or vahaan phir se angrej rajvansh kii sthapana kii gai
 Austria was given the territories of Belizea and Lombardi, Italy
 is prakaar madhya europe main uskaa prabhaav kaayam ho gaya or metarnak apane uddeshy main safal rahaa
 Russia received Warsaw and Weisrevig
 falat: pashchimi europe main uskaa kaaphi vistaar hua
 Italy was divided into small kingdoms and given to the ancient rulers there and the influence of Austria was established in Italy
 poland kaa astitv samaapt ho gaya
 Rus, Prasha and Austria divide it among themselves
 spain main pun: pracheen rajvansh kii sthapana kii gai
 Although Purtigal had assisted the British, but nothing was given to it
 sweden or denmark ko dand mila
 Switzerland became more powerful than before
 use 22 rajyon kaa shaktishaalee sangh banaaya gaya
 The decisions of Congress regarding Germany were quite important
 germany ke bache hue 38 rajyon ko milakar ek sangh banaaya gaya
 Whose head was the Emperor Francisco i of Austria
 iske atirikt congress ne or bhi anek kaary kiye usne das- pratha ko aniatik banaaya
 Decisions were also taken regarding international methods
 bhavishya main europea shanti ko kaayam rakhane ke liye ek antarrashtriya sanstha kii sthapana kii gai jise europea vyavastha kaha jaataa he
 Evaluation of the actions of the Vienna Congress- vienna congress kaa aarambh ucch aadarshon evam uddeshyon kii ghoshnaa ke saath hua tha
 But his purpose was not served
 uskaa kaary karne kaa dhang doshapurn tha
 All nations were engaged in accomplishing their selfishness
 at: samasyaon ke samaadhaan main yah asafal rahaa
 The program of the Vienna Conference was based on selfishness
 iske sadasyon ne naitik siddhanton ko apeksha kii
 Therefore, its decisions proved to be temporary redundant
 isane europe ke nav nirmaan main koi aisa prayaas nahin kiya jisase janata kii ichha kii purti ho sake or sthaayee taur par vyavastha kaayam ho sake
 It determined the national boundary only on the basis of the principle of power balance, but gave some importance to the popular sentiment
 isapar dusraa aarope yah lagaaya jaataa he ki isane kuch kaaryon ko adhura chhod diya or kuch samasyaon par isane dhyaan nahin diya jaise- europea shanti ko surakshit rakhane ke ek liye ek sandhi patr par hastakshar karnaa tha lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Some historians have called the Vienna Congress reactionary
 iske liye rashtriya bhaavana kii koi keemat nahin thi isapar yah bhi aarope he ki bade rashtron ke hiton k raksha ke liye chote rashtron ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai
 In spite of the above allegations, one has to accept that political restraint and far-sightedness were employed in Vienna
 germany or italy ke ekikaran kii disha main isane mahatvapurn kaam kiya
 Not only this, the practice of slavery, trade, freedom etc
 was also considered
 rajyon kii araajaktaa ko nasht karne kii disha main isane mahatvapurn kaam kiya
 It also created the international constitution
 iske kaaryon ke falswarup europe main 40 varshon tak shanti bani rahi
 The meeting was called for the first time to discuss international issues
 or isane europea vyavastha kaa sanghathan kiya tha ise ham pratham antareashtriya sangton kah sakate he
 This was a huge achievement
 uparokt uddeshyon tathaa lakshyon kii prapti ke liye vienna kangeras ne kuch siddhanth banaae jo nimna the- The colonial empire of England was increased
 usko malta, elegoland aadi dweep mili tathaa france ke tobgo, morisus tathaa saint lucia ke dweep tathaa spain se trinidad kshetron kii prapti hui
 The boundaries of France were fixed as they were before the revolution

 An amount of 70 crore francs was demanded as war damages
 france ke simavarti kshetron se shaktishaalee rashtron kaa nirmaan kiya gaya taaki bhavishya main france mahadweep kii shanti ko bhang na kar saken
 Louis 18th of the Bourvo dynasty was re-installed on the throne of France
 germany main nepolian se purv pavitra roman samrajya maujuud tha
 Napoleon abolished it and formed the Rhine Union and nationalism spread there
 vienna kangeras is rashtriyata ke prasar ko rokane ke liye katibaddh thi
 Hence, a loosely formed federation was formed there, headed by Emperor Francis of Austria
 austria ko italy main venesia tathaa lombardi ke pradesh die gaye
 South Valacia was also obtained from Poland
 is prakaar austria ne khoi shakti or pratishtha punah praapt kar lee
 Italy was divided into many small states
 italy vastutah, meternik ke shabdon main, keval ek bhugolic abhivyakti ban kar rahaa gaya
 Thus Austria's influence over Italy was established
 vienna kangeras main das pratha kaa virodh kiya gaya
 The Congress created an international institution known as the 'european system' to maintain peace
 pehali baar antarrashtriya samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 Through this, the issues of the movement of ships in the rivers, the use of the sea and the mutual dealings between nations were explained
 vienna kangeras kii mukhya uplabdhi yah rahi ki isane europe main lagbhag 40 varshon tak shanti kii sthapana kii jisaki europavaasiyon ko us samay sarvaadhik jarurat thi
 The Vienna Congress tried to establish peace at the international level and established the first international organization by establishing the European system, on whose foundation the foundation of the United Nations and the United Nations was built
 vienna kangeras main france ke saath apekshaakrit nyaaypurna vyavhaar kiya gaya tha or parajeet shakti hone ke baavjood use kangeras main pratinidhitiv diya gaya, jabaki pratham vishwayuddh ke pashchaat varsay kii sandhi main parajeet germany ko pratinidhitiv nahin mila or sandhi ke kade praavdhaan us par thope die gaye
 In conclusion, we can say that the Vienna Congress immediately established peace in Europe
 france ke saath naram vyavhaar karne jaise sakaaratmak kadam uthaae
 But, trying to stop the spread of ideology like liberalism, nationalism, worked against the stream of history
 is drushti se vienna kangeras pratikriyaavaadi maansikta kaa pratinidhitiv karti thi

 However, this treaty caused the Maharaja to be greatly humiliated among the Sikhs

 Zaman Shah was the son of Ahmad Shah Abdali's son Timur Shah, whose brother was Mahmud Shah
 astu, maharaja ranjaiti singh swayan chaahate the ki ve kashmir ko atamohammad se mukt karavaaen
 Therefore, upon coming to Suyog, Maharaja Ranjit Singh liberated Kashmir
 unke dewan mohakamchand ne shergarh ke kile ko gher kar vafa begum ke pati shahshuja ko reeha kar vafa begum ke paas lahore pahunchaa diya
 Rajkumar Kharagsingh accommodated them in Mubarak Haveli

 Hence, he pledged to put Shahshuja on the throne of Kabul by placing his hand on "gurugranth Sahib"
 phir use "pagadi-badal bhai" banane ke liye usase pagadi badal kar kohinoor praapt kar liya
 Wafa Begum, sitting in the curtain of the curtain, understood the prudence of the Maharaja
 ab kohinoor maharaja ranjit singh ke paas pahunch gaya tha or ve santusht the ki unhone kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya tha
 He wished to offer the Kohinoor diamond to the iconic Lord Jagannath in the temple of Jagannathpuri

 He also offered immense gold at the Vishwanath temple in Kashi

 But the commander of the Sikh army, Lalsingh, betrayed and left the front and fled to Lahore

 Equality before law is taken from the British constitution
 It is a negative right which denies the privileges of a person, this right is called rule of law, rule of law
 It means that the administration of the country is to run according to the law and not according to the wishes of the people, this rule is the highest law of regular law
 It establishes the lordship of law in the governance of the country
 yah desh kii sarkaar ko bhi vidhi se baandh detaa he, vidhi ke shashan ko diasi ne lokapriy banaaya tha 1 No person shall be physically-economically punished unless he violates the law

 3 All persons shall be governed by the general laws and courts of the country without distinction
 4 Constitution of the country
 This is the result of laws, this 4th rule is applicable in India 'the Constitution is the highest law of the country and is decided by the legislature
 All the laws will be valid only if the law is in conformity with the constitution
 The importance of rule of law is only after the rule of law is the law of the person, the law is the rule of the ruler
 Present indicates 3 paragraph 32, 226 establishes the rule of law
 There are three exceptions to the rule of law
 1 The President and the Governor shall not be liable before any court for acts related to the exercise of their powers
 2 No criminal judicial proceedings against the President and the Governor during his term of office
 Will not start, will continue 3 Any civil action against the President and the Governor will take him two months
 It cannot be started without giving advance notice
 Exceptions beyond the constitution, the visiting head of state, diplomatic staff will also be beyond the rule of law
 Equal protection of the law is taken from the US Constitution and the positive word is' Person found in similar circumstances, Equal protection of the law will be provided, but it also does not mean to establish equality in inequalities or inequality in the same

 16 In special circumstances, residence can be considered as a special qualification for appointment
 Only Parliament can make laws related to the residence
 16 Any provision in this article provides reservation of posts for backward classes to the state
 Will not stop from doing it, but reservation is not a right to be obtained, it depends only on the will of the state This reservation is available in two cases only when the class which is to be given is socially and socially backward
 2 It is not adequately represented in public services
 According to the decision of Indira Sawhney vs
 Union of India 1992 The benefit of the service is only for admission in the service and not for the reservation given to 2 backward classes for promotion
 While he Rajyho the creamy identifying and them in OBC Reservation directs denial of benefits 4 There will be no reservation in the area of specialization and ultimate specialization 5 If there is only one post for appointment, then no reservation will be applicable

 The place where 69% reservation has been given in the ninth schedule of the constitution has been passed

 The writ gives the right to issue instructions, according to Dr
 Ambedkar, this is the most important article of the Constitution, without which the provision is meaningless, without this article, other fundamental rights cannot be considered real because this article gives the person his fundamental rights without this
 Other rights will be left only on paper
 This article protected the Supreme Court from the fundamental rights of a person
 It has also appointed the duty of issuing writ to the Supreme Court
 If the fundamental rights are proved to be violated in the Supreme Court, then they must compulsorily issue the writ and the rights will also be obtained in the hands of the judiciary
 There are alternatives through which it can maintain the right to the highest judicial review of the constitution, rule of law, etc

e
 it can be exercised only in violation of Fundamental Rights but the High Court can also use them to enforce other statutory rights under Article 226 along with Article 32
 In this way, the jurisdiction of the High Court is greater
 It is the constitutional duty of the Supreme Court to give remedies in the event of violation of fundamental right, but Article 226
 It does not give any such constitutional obligation to the High Court
 It comes under their discretion
 Whether they give relief or not, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is all over the country but the High Court is confined only to its territory
 shikharji yaa shri shikharji yaa parasnath parvat bharat ke jharkhand rajya ke giridih zile main chota nagpur pathaar par sthit ek pahari he jo vishwa kaa sabase mahatvapurn jain tirth sthal bhi he
 20 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism attained salvation in this saintly region known as 'shri Sammed Shikharji'
 yaheen 23 wein tirthakar bhagwaan parswanath ne bhi nirvana praapt kiya tha
 It is believed that 20 of the 24 Jains attained salvation
 1,350 meter unchaa yah pahaad jharkhand kaa sabase ooncha sthaan bhi he
 Shikharji is an important pilgrimage site for the followers of Jainism
 parasnath parvat vishwa prasiddh he
 Every year millions of Jain religious people come here, along with other tourists also consider it necessary to worship Parasnath mountain
 giridih stesan se pahaad kii talahati madhuban tak kramshah 14 or 18 mile he
 The mountain descent and journey is about 18 miles
 sammed shikhar jain dharm ko maanane waalon kaa ek pramukh tirth sthaan he
 It is considered to be the best among Jain pilgrimages
 jain dharamshastron ke anusaar jain dharm ke 24 main se 20 tirthankarasn or anek santon va muniyon ne yahan moksh praapt kiya tha
 Therefore it is called 'siddhakshetra' and in Jainism it is called Tirtharaj i
e
 'king of Tirthas'
 yah tirth bharat ke jharkhand pradesh ke giridih jile main madhuban kshetra main sthit he
 It is the main pilgrimage of Jainism
 ise 'parasnath parvat' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to Jain texts, the existence of both Samamed Shikhar and Ayodhya is parallel to creation
 isliye inako 'shaashvat' mana jaataa he 
 Here in ancient texts, Tirthankaras and ascetic saints attained salvation through rigorous penance and meditation
 yahi kaaran he ki jab sammed shikhar tirthayatra shuru hoti he to har tirthayatri kaa man tirthankarasn kaa samaran kar apaar shraddha, aasthaa, utsaah or khushi se bharaa hota he
 It is written in Jainism scriptures that once a soulful pilgrimage to the Samkad Shikhar shrine in one's life, a person does not get animal vagina and hell after death
 yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki jo vyakti sammed shikhar aakar puure man, bhav or nishtha se bhakthi karata he, use moksh praapt hota he or is sansar ke sabhi janm-karm ke bandhanon se agle 49 janmon tak mukt vah rahata he
 All this is possible only when all the devotees here remember the Tirthankaras and follow the teachings, teachings and principles given by them with pure conduct
 is prakaar yah kshetra bahut pavitra mana jaataa he
 The natural violent behavior of wild animals like lions, tigers, etc
 found here is not seen due to the sanctity and sattvikta of this region
 is kaaran tirthayatri bhi bina bhay ke yatra karte hai
 It is probably because of this effect that many kings, Acharyas, Bhattaraks, Shravaks from ancient times came here with huge groups for pilgrimage in the spirit of self-welfare and salvation, worshiping Tirthankaras, meditating and performing rigorous penance

 The remaining 20 Tirthankaras attained salvation at Sammed Shikhar
 jain dharm ke 23wein tirthankar bhagwaan parswanath ne bhi isi tirth main kathor tap or dhyaan dwaara moksh praapt kiya tha
