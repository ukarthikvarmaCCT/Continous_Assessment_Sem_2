 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya keval hare paudhon se hoti he or sameekaran atyant saadhaaran he
 Nevertheless, it is a controversial question as to how simple substances like CO2 and water make complex substances like carbohydrates
 samay-samay par vibhinn padap karyiki visheshgyon ne is kriya ko samajhane ke liye vibhinn mat prakat kiye hai
 Among them are the votes of Baird, Wilsetter and Staal and Arnone
 baiyar, willstator tathaa stall ke maton kaa keval aitihaasik mahatv he
 These were not found to be correct in subsequent tests
 1967 main aranon ne bataaya ki chloroplast main paayi jane vaali protein farrodoxin prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main mukhya kaary karti he
 It is recognized by all scientists in the modern era that in oxygenation, free oxygen comes from water
 aadhunik samay main anek prayogon ke aadhaar par yah siddh ho chukaa he ki prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya nimna do charnon main sampann hoti he
 In the first stage, the light process or the hill process or the photochemical process
 or duusare charan main andheri prakriya athwa blekaman prakriya yaa prakashahin prakriya
 In the process of photosynthesis, both processes take place after each other
 prakaash prakriya andheri prakriya kii upeksha adhik teji se hoti he
 Photosynthesis occurs in all chloroplast-containing cells of the plant
 arthath paudhe ke samast hare bhaagon main hoti he
 This action occurs especially in the mesophyll tissue of the leaves because the parenchyma cells of the mesophyll tissue of the leaves have a greater amount of chloroplast than other cells
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main jo prakriya prakaash kii upasthiti main hoti he use prakaash kriya ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This activity was studied by other scientists like Hill
 prakaash prakriyaaon ke samay andheri prakriyaayen seemaabaddh kaarak kaa kaary karti hai
 Lighting processes take place in two stages, photolysis and placement of hydrogen
 photolysis kii prakriya main prakaash chlorophyl ke anu dwaara photone ke rup main avashoshit kii jaati he
 When the chlorophyll molecule absorbs one quantum of light, the second molecule of chlorophyll does not absorb the light until the first energy is used in the process of photosynthesis
 chlorophyl dwaara is prakaar shoshit prakaash kaa photone ucch urja str par ek electron nikaalati he tathaa yah shakti phosphate ke tisare band par sthit hokar ucch urja vaale adinosine tryphosphate ke rup main prakat hote hai
 Thus Chloropil produces ATP in the presence of light and this process is called phosphorylation
 is prakaar surya ke prakaash kii urja atipi arthath rasinic urja main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Thus, the ATP produced in the chlorophyll molecule is helpful in many chemical reactions such as CO2 being deoxidized into sugars, separated from the chlorophyll molecule
 chlorophyl is atipi ko swatantra karne par phir akriy ho jaataa he
 According to Van Neil Frank, Wishnik, when water comes into contact with this functional chlorophyll, the water is dissected in unoxidized h and strong oxidizing OH
 chlorophyl + prakaash → sakriy chlorophiliah2o + sakriy chlorophyl → H+ + oh-is photolysis prakriya main O2 pani se swatantra ho jaati he tathaa hydrogen bhi hydrogen graahak par chali jaati he
 2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2 Thus all the oxygen released from the photosynthetic activities of plants is derived from water
 hill, ruben ne iskaa samarthan kiya tathaa O18 kaa prayog karke isko siddh kiya
 The release of oxygen from water was shown to be in the absence of CO2 in an algae called chlorilla
 iskaa arth hua ki CO2 kii anupasthiti main oxygen kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he, parantu isamen hydrogen graahak hona chahie
 It has been observed that NADP forms two NADPH2 in plants
 2H2O+2NADP=2NADPH2+O2 According to Aranan, light action is mainly related to construction
 NADPH2 / NADP ke avkaran se banataa he
 NADP is also known as TPN
 atipi ek prakaash urja anu he jo edipi main ek phosphate group ke judane se banataa he tathaa is kriya ko phosforilation kehete hai
 Phosphorylation of ADP requires light energy, so it is also called photo-phosphorylation
 yah bhi ek jatil kriya he tathaa aranan ke anusaar prakaash prakriya do prakramon main hoti he
 Combination photo-phosphorylation and Pair photo-phosphorylation In the photo-phosphorylation, electrons are continuously obtained due to the decomposition of water and ATP is produced by light energy in chlorophyll on the action of photo-phosphorylation
 is prakaar chlorophyl ‘a’ ke sakriy hone par pheredoxin electron grahi kaa kaary karti he jise enedipi naamak coenzyme ko detaa he jisamen enedy pani dwaara mukt kii gai hydrogen ko pakad kar NADPH2 main parivartit ho jaataa he
 In this way, the free electrons dissolved in water are excited at chlorophyll 'b' and reach a higher energy level, and these electrons are again obtained by the type chlorophyll 'a', it is not fully known but it is believed That the electron receptor called plastokavinone captures these electrons which then revert to chlorophyll 'a' by the cytochrome
 isamen saath-saath atipi kaa bhi nirmaan hota he
 In the process of pair photo-phosphorylation, chlorophyll 'a' is activated by sunlight and throws electrons out which are captured by the ferridoxine present in chlorophyll
 yahi electron mukt hokar plastoquinon naamak electron grahi dwaara pakad liya jaataa he
 In the middle of this action, ADP is converted to ATP and the electron is released again and goes back to the chlorophyll 'a' via the cytochrome wicker
 is kriya main bhi edipi, atipi main parivartit ho jaataa he
 External electrons are not used in this activity and the electron comes out of chlorophyll and comes back there again
 is prakaar ayugma va yugma prakriyaaon dwaara pani vighatit ho jaataa he jisase oxigen gas swatantra ho jaati he tathaa hydrogen, hydrogen grahi enedipi dwaara pakad lee jaati he tathaa saath hi saath urja bhi vargeekrut ho jaati he jiskaa prayog rasinic prakriya yaa aprakashiya pratikriya main hota he
 Oxygen and photosynthesis is prakriya ke liye prakaash kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Carbon dioxide is often degraded in this process
 is prakriya main pattee ke stomata dwaara grahan kii gai carbondioxide, pani se nikali hydrogen prakaash kii urja ke kaaran milakar ek sthaayee dravya banaata he
 CH2O, it is a unit molecule of carbohydrates
 kelvin va banson ne radio isotopic takanic kaa prayog kar bataaya ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii prakriya main pehla sthai yogic ek 3 carbon vaala 3-phosphoglicerick amla banataa he
 Photosynthesis was carried out briefly in the presence of radioactive C14O2 in algae called Chlorolla and Syndesmus, and these also formed the first stable liquid phosphoglyceric acid
 yah phosphoglicerick amla baad main glucose banaata he
 Thus it was proved by the work of Calvin and his colleagues that CO2 is converted into glucose in the photosynthesis process
 unhone is prayog main carbon ke samasthanik kaa prayog kiya
 Chlorophyll contains ribulose-1,5 visphosphate
 ab vayumandaleey CO2 pattee ke stomata dwaara pravesh kar andar pahunchati he tathaa turant hi ribuloj-1,5 visphosphate ke saath milakar ek asthai yogic kaa nirmaan kati he
 The temporary compound thus formed, which is 5-carbon sugar, soon breaks down into 2 molecules of phosphoglyceric acid
 ab yahaan par NADPH2 dwaara hydrogen mukt kiye jane par pijie ko pijieel main parivartit kar detaa he
 Energy is obtained from ATP in this activity
 is prakaar CO2 se carbohydrates nirmaan ho jate hai
 In the dark process of photosynthesis, plants in which the first permanent compound phosphoglyceric acid is formed are called C3 plant
 phosphoglissrik amla ek 3 carbon vaala yogic he isliye in paudhon kaa aisa namakaran he
 The plants in which the first permanent compound forms a compound of 4 carbons are called C4 plants
 saadharantah 4 carbon vaala yogic oxaloecetic amla banataa he
 It was previously believed that only C3 or Calvin cycle occurred during the stabilization or fixation of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, that is, the first stable compound is phosphoglyceric acid
 lekin 1966 main hech evam slack ne bataaya ki carbondioxide ke sthirikaran kaa ek doosraa path bhi he
 He studied in sugarcane, maize, amaranthus, etc
 that phosphoinol pyruvic acid, which is a 3-carbon specific compound, combines with carbon dioxide to form 4-carbon-specific compound oxaloacetic acid
 is kriya main phosphoinol piruveet carboxillage injim utprerak kaa kaary karata he
 There are four main components in the process of photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, light and foliage
 in chaaron kii upasthiti is kriya ke liye ati aavashyak he
 Of these, water and carbon dioxide are called raw materials for photosynthesis because the main products of photosynthesis are the formation of carbohydrates by their creative ingredients
 in avyavo ko paudha apane aas-paas ke vaataavaran se grahan karata he
 Carbon dioxide is a major component and raw material of photosynthesis
 vayumandal main carbondioxide gas shwasan, dahan, kinvan, vighatan aadi kriyaaon ke dwaara mukt hoti he
 Its volume in air is 0
03% to 0
04%
 sthaliy paudhe ise sidhe hi vaayu se grahan kar lete hai
 The leaves of these plants have small holes called parnandhra
 carbondioxide inhen parnarandhron se paudhe kii pattiyon main pravesh karti he
 Submerged plants ingest carbon dioxide dissolved in water by diffusing it from their physical surface
 jal main carbondioxide kaa strot jaleey jantu hai, jinke shwasan main yah gas utpann hoti he
 The decomposition of carbonate and bicarbonate present in the underwater rocks also produces carbon dioxide which aquatic plants consume in photosynthesis
 prakaash-sanshleshan main glucose naamak carbohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he
 In this, carbon and oxygen atoms are obtained from carbon dioxide
 chlorophyl chlorophyl ek proteinous jatil rasinic yogic he
 It is the main pigment of photosynthesis
 chlorophyl e tathaa chlorophyl bi do prakaar kaa hota he
 It is found in chloroplasts of all autotrophic green plants
 chlorophyl ke anu surya ke prakaashiya urja ko avashoshit kar use rasinic urja main roopaantarit karte hai
 Chlorophyll molecules are excited by absorbing the Sun's optical energy
 ye sakriy anu jal ke anuon ko H+ tathaa OH- aayan main vighatit kar dete hai
 Thus chlorophyll molecules initiate the biochemical activity of photosynthesis
 prakaash surya kaa prakaash prakaash-sanshleshan ke liye aavashyak he
 Photosynthesis also takes place in the intense artificial light of bulbs etc
 laal rang ke prakaash main yah kriya sabase adhik hoti he
 This action is most common in red after purple
 ye donon rang chlorophyl dwaara sarvaadhik adhik maatra main avashoshit kiye jate hai
 The green color reflects chlorophyll completely, so photosynthesis stops completely in every color
 jal jal prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya kaa kaccha maal he
 Terrestrial plants absorb it from soil by root roots
 jaleey paudhe apane jal ke sampark vaale bhaagon kii bahya sataha se jal kaa avasorana karte hai
 Uprooting plants such as orchids absorb atmospheric water vapor through their pneumatic roots
 prakaash-sanshleshan ke prakaashiya abhikriya main jal ke prakaashiya vighatan se oxigen utpann hota he
 This oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct
 adheri abhikriya main banane vaali glucose ke anuon main hydrogen tatv ke anu jal se hi praapt hote hai
 Water also performs indirect functions during photosynthesis
 yah jeevadravya kii kriyasheeltaa tathaa injime kii sakriyata ko banaae rakhata he
 Photosynthesis is affected by many factors
 iske kuch kaarak bahya hote hai tathaa kuch aantarik
 Additionally there are some limiting factors
 bahya kaaran ve hote he jo prakruti or paryaavaran main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan ko prabhavit karte hai jaise prakaash, chunki surya ke prakaash se paudha is kriya ke liye urja praapt karata he tathaa andhere se yah kriya sambhav hi nahin he
 Carbon dioxide, because it has been observed that if all other factors are obtained in the highest amount by the plant and the amount of CO2 is gradually increased in the atmosphere, the rate of photosynthesis also increases
 taapmaana, kyo ki dekha gaya he ki paudhon main prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ke liye ek nishchit tapakram kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he tathaa jal, pani photochemical prakriyaaon ke atyant aavashyak he or yah is kriya ke samay anek rasinic parivartanon main sahyog karata he
 Internal causes are those that affect the action of photosynthesis by being located in the leaves, such as foliage or chlorophyll by which light energy is converted into chemical energy
 praras / jeevadravya / puras yaa protoplasm jisamen paae jane vaale vikar prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai
 The deposition of food, because if the food produced in the process of photosynthesis continues to accumulate in the local cells, the rate of photosynthesis slows down
 pattiyon kii aantarik sanrachana kyon ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar pattiyon main upasthit stomata yaa randhron kii sankhya tathaa unke band evam khulne ke samay par nirbhar karti he
 Age of leaves, as new leaves have higher rates of photosynthesis of older leaves
 iske atirikt prakaash sanshleshan ko in sabhi vastuon kii alag-alag gati bhi prabhavit karti he
 When an action of photosynthesis is controlled by various factors, the speed of photosynthesis is controlled by the slowest factor
 prakaash, carbondioxide, jal, chlorophyl ityadi main se jo bhi uchit pariman se kam pariman main hota he, vah puri kriya kii gati ko niyantrit rakhata he
 This factor is called time-bounded factor

 Optical energy is used in the presence of foliage and oxygen is released as a by-product
 prakaash sanshleshan ek anksikaran - avkaran prakriya he jisamen jal kaa prakaashik oxikaran tathaa CO 2 kaa aprakashik avkaran hota he or carbonic yogic banate he tathaa oxygen mukt hoti he
 Mechanism of Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is a very complex process, which is mainly carried out in two terms - 1 optical reaction and 2 unpublished reactions, 1
 Optical Reaction - In order to harness the energy of sunlight and to make hydrogen available by the dispersion of water, these activities take place in the presence of light in the particles called grana inside the green lantern
 in kanon main parnaharim yaa chlorophyl naamak padaarth hota he
 These actions can be summarized as follows: The radiation energy of sunlight activates the chlorophyll molecules and expels the energetically excited electrons
 sakriy chlorophyl se aavashyak urja praapt kar jal ke anuon kaa vichchhedan hota he jisase hydrogen tathaa anxigen praapt hoti he|agar aapako bhi ganit lagati he acchhee to aapkaa bhavishya he ujjwal, jane kaise? uttejit elevatron ek vishesh tantra, jise elevatron sthaanantaran tantra kehete he, ke dwaara apni urja de dete he
 This energy is stored in ADP molecules by leaving a phosphate group and leaving
 praapt anxizan paudhe se baahar nikal jaati hai
 The hydrogen obtained is collected by the receptor material called NADP
 isamen NADP
H 2 kaa nirmaan hota he
 2
 Unpublished Reaction - Light is not required for these actions
 in abhikriyaaon ko inaki khoj karne vaale vaigyanik ke naam ke aadhaar par bluecoman abhikriyaayein kehete hai
 These actions take place in the pelvic or stroma of the larynx
 in samast kriyaaon ko, jo ek vishesh padaarth ribulos biphosphate kii upasthiti main ek chakra ke rup main hoti he, calvin chakra bhi kehete hai
 In a nutshell, these reactions can be expressed as follows: In the presence of certain substances, CO 2 obtained from the atmosphere is degraded from h + of NADP
H 2 obtained from optical activity and forms a substance called PGAL
 in kriyaao main agralikhit abhikriyaayein sammilit he- 5 carbon vaale yogic rubp ke saath carbon dianksaide ke anu milakar ek 6 carbon asthaayee yogic kaa nirmaan karte he- yah asthaayee yogic sheeghra hi apachayit hokar va tuutakar do anu PGA bana letaa he
 It is a three-carbon compound - PGA molecules subsequently become more reduced, forming PGAL
 PGAL ke do anu milakar tathaa apchayan ke dwaara phosphate sharkara kaa tathaa baad main sharkara kaa nirmaan kar lete hai
 PGAL itself can also act like food
 yah teen carbon parmaanu vaala yogic he
 Its two molecules combine to form one molecule of glucose
 glucose se hi anya sabhi prakaar ke bhojya padaarthon, jaise - protein, vasa, mand ityadi kaa nirmaan bhi paudhe ke andar hi ho jaataa he
 In the Calvin cycle, PGAL and its products also regenerate ribulose biphosphate, which means that it is remodeled to run the reactions of the cycle

 worldcat is a union catalog that itemizes the collections of 72,000 libraries in 170 countries and territories which participate in the Online Computer Library Center global cooperative
 It is built and maintained collectively by the participating libraries
 The catalog was created in 1971
 It contains more than 300 million records, representing over 2 billion physical and digital assets in more than 470 languages, janvari 2014 ke anusaar 
 It is the world's largest bibliographic database
 OCLC makes worldcat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other fee-based OCLC services 
 worldcat was founded by Fred Kilgour in 1967
 In 2003, OCLC began the "open worldcat" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of worldcat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its member libraries' collections
 In 2006, it became possible to search worldcat directly at its website
 In 2007, worldcat Identities began providing pages for 20 million "identities", predominantly authors and individuals who are the subjects of published titles
 worldcat operates on a batch processing model rather than a real-time model
 That is, worldcat records are synchronized at intermittent intervals with the underlying library catalogs instead of real-time or every day
 worldcat shows that a particular item is owned by a particular library, but does not provide that library's call number
 It also does not indicate if the item is currently borrowed, lost, undergoing restoration or repair, or moved to storage not directly accessible to patrons 
 worldcat also does not show if a library owns multiple copies of a particular title
 As an alternative, worldcat allows participating institutions to add direct links from worldcat to their own catalog entries for a particular item, which enables the user to determine its real-time status
 However, this still requires users to open multiple web pages, each pointing to a different OPAC with its own distinctive user interface design, until they can locate a catalog entry that shows the item is currently available at a particular library

 'prerana' kaa mishan tha har maheene ek nayaa loakgeet khojkar use lipibaddh karnaa
 The mixed result of his family's nationalist views and Komal Kothari's love for music resulted in his interest in Rajasthani patriotic folk songs composed between 1800 and 1942

 Neil Fraser is an Australian tennis player
 yah tay karnaa maanav-jati ke liye hameshaa se ek samasya rahaa he ki nyaay kaa thik-thik arth kya hona chahie or lagbhag sadaiv uski vyakhya samay ke sandarbh main kii gai he
 In broad terms, its meaning has been changed according to what is good
 jaisaa ki di
di
 rafal kaa mat he- The Greeks and Romans first tried to decide the meaning of justice
 unani darshanik aflatoon ne nyaay kii paribhaasha karte hue use sadgun kaha, jiske saath sanyam, budhimaani or saahas kaa sanyog hona chahie
 He was of the opinion that justice is employed to maintain its duty, that is, to maintain its proper place in the society
 unka mat tha ki nyaay vah sadgun he jo anya sabhi sadgunon ke bich saamanjasy sthapit karata he
 According to him, justice is the virtue that brings balance or preservation in any society
 unke shishy arestu ne nyaay ke arth main sanshodhan karte hue kaha ki nyaay kaa abhipraay aavashyak rup se ek khaas str kii samanta he
 This similarity can be based on similarity and proportionality or equivalence of behavior
 unhone aage kaha ki vyavhaar kii samanta se ‘yogyatanusaari nyaay’ utpann hota he or anupatikata se ‘vitaranatmak nyaay’ pratifalit hota he
 In this, the work of the courts and judges is the distribution of justice according to merit and the work of the legislature is the distribution of distributive justice
 do vyaktiyon ke bich ke kanoonee vivaadon main dand kii vyavastha yogyatanusaari nyaay ke siddhanton ke anusaar hona chahie, jisamen nyaaypalika ko samanta ke madhyavarti bindu par pahunchne kaa praytn karnaa chahie or raajnneetik adhikaron, sammaan, sampatti tathaa vastuon ke aavanton main vitaranatmak nyaay ke siddhanton par chalanaa chahie
 Along with this, it is necessary to create a synergy between distributive and qualified justice in any society
 faltah arestu ne kisi bhi samaaj main nyaay kii avadharana ko ek parivartandharmee santulan ke rup main dekha, jo sadaa ek hi sthiti main nahin rah sakati
 The Romans and the Stoics developed a slightly different concept of justice
 unka maananaa tha ki nyaay kanoonon or prathaon se nisruth nahin hota balki use tark-buddhi se hi praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Justice will be divine and equal for all
 samaaj ke kanoonon ko in kanoonon ke anuroop hona chahie; tabhi unka koi matlab hoga, anyathaa nahin
 In order for man-made law to be truly law, it is necessary that it matches this law and the imagination of natural justice
 is prakritik nyaay kii kalpana kaa vikaas sarvapratham stoikon ne kiya tha or baad main use roman catholic isai padariyon ne apana liya
 In the eyes of this justice, all human beings were equal
 apni kriti instillutes main justinian tark-buddhi dwaara viksit yaa praapt kanoon tathaa aam logon ke kanoon yaa aam kanoon ke bich bhed kiya
 Then nothing special happened in this area in Europe until the Reformation movement, Renaissance and Industrial Revolution
 lock, ruso or kaant - jaise vichaarkon kii drushti main nyaay kaa matlab swatantraaa, samanta or kanoon kaa mishran tha
 Feudalism, autocratic monarchy and caste privileges to early liberals appeared to be unjust and therefore illegal
 unki drushti main swatantraaa or samanta ke bina nyaay kaa koi matlab nahin tha
 This notion of justice prevailed until the nineteenth century, and then a disagreement arose between liberal and socialist or Marxism thinking streams
 bentham or mil ke upyogetavaadi siddhant kaa bolbalaa hua
 According to this theory, whatever was helpful in maximizing the happiness or utility of mankind was justice
 unka maananaa tha ki samast pratibandhon kii anupasthiti main sukh samahit hai, lekin tab samaajawaadee or marxvaadi yah daleel lekar saamne aae ki poonjivadi saanpattik sambandhon se utpann garibi or asamanta ke atirek anyaaypurna hai or unka samarthan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As far as liberal thinking streams are concerned, the judicial view of the early classical liberals was the main viewpoint of the liberals until the middle of the twentieth century
 parantu kence kii kalpana ke kalyankari rajyon ke udai ke saath udaaravaadi parampara main nyaay kii ek nai abhidharana kaa vikaas karnaa aavashyak ho gaya
 Perhaps the best explanation of that notion is in the Rawls-authored a Theory of Justice
 beesvin sadi ke antim dashakon main nav-udaarvaad tathaa jise america main liberterienism arthath ichaswatantrawad kii sangya di gai he uske udai ke saath udaaravaadi parampara main nyaay kaa ek or siddhant udbhoot hua
 In fact, libertarianism meant a return to the conception of justice of the early classical liberals in support of free market, minimum state and freedom and immoral rights to property
 yah he ‘nyaay kaa hakdaari siddhant’, jise robert nogic ne apni kriti 'anarki, state and utapia' main lokapriy banaaya

 The First World War ended in 1919 AD and exactly 20 years after that, the Second World War started in 1939 AD
 in do vishwayudhon ke madhya vishwa raajnneetik kaa kai katu anubhavon se saamana hua
 European politicians did not learn any lesson from the horrors of the First World War
 shanti kii sthapana hetu adarshavaadi baaten to bahut kii gayi magar vyavhaar main unka paalan nahin kiya gaya
 It seemed from US President Woodrow Wilson's 14 sources that, following them, could pave the way for the establishment of world peace
 paris shanti sammelan ke dauraan jis tarah france ke pradhanmantri clemenshon ne wilson kii adarshavaadi baton kaa uphaas udaaya, usase pataa chalata he ki paris shanti sammelan ke pratinidhi vishwa shanti kii sthapana ko lekar drudh pratijna nahin he
 This was the reason that the flag of the League of Nations was destroyed
 england evam france mookadarshak bane dekhte rahe
 After the First World War, world politicians made commendable efforts towards disarmament
 iske alaava bhi shanti sthapana kii disha main pahal kii
 The rise of Hitler by Germany was the most important event affecting world history
 uskaa udai 1919 i
 kii varsay kii sandhi dwaara germany ke hue apmaan kaa badla lene ke liye hi hua tha
 Marshall Fauch had predicted in 1919 itself that it is not a peace treaty, it is a ceasefire for 20 years, seeing the outrageous sections of the Treaty of Warsaw
 marshall fouch kii ukt bhavishyavaanee antat hitler ne satya siddh kara di
 The security problem in France was the most important question in the world politics between the two world wars
 france ne varsay kii 1919 kii sandhi dwaara 1871 kii frencfort sandhi kaa badla le liya tha
 Now he feared that Germany might avenge the humiliation of Warsaw in the future, so this fear created the problem of French security
 france chahta tha ki germany ke madhya sthit rin pradesh main ek swatantra rajya kaa nirmaan kiya jaye, jo ki bafer state kii bhanti kaary kare
 This demand of France was not accepted by the Allies but the following three things of France were considered - bismark ne apni videsh niti kaa mul uddeshy france ko mitraheen banaaye rakhana banaaya tha
 In the same series, France now wanted to make Germany alone
 chunki england evam france ke hit kai sthaan par takaraate the atah england, france kaa vishwasaneey mitra nahin ban saktaa tha
 France wanted to weaken Germany
 england dohari niti chal rahaa tha
 He wanted to strike a balance between France and Germany
 england evam america kii ore se suraksha kaa koi thos aashwaasan praapt na hone par france ne anya deshon ke saath sandhiyaan kin jo nimnlikhit hai - France did not gain any special benefit by making treaties with the above small countries
 hitler in samjhauton ko ek ke pashchaat ek thokar martha gaya
 He disbanded Czechoslovakia, exposed all the friendly associations to the invasion of Poland
 3 sitambar ko poland par akraman ke viruddh france ko yuddh chhedana padaa
 The members of the Sangh accepted that disarmament is necessary for the establishment of world peace in Section 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations
 is sambandh ke 1921 i
 main rashtrasang ne ek ayog gathit kiya
 In 1923, this commission drafted
 iske anusaar - In the 5th Assembly of the League of Nations in 1924, England and France introduced a form for world peace
 yahi 'geneva protocol' kehalaata he
 Under this, the process of Panch decision was emphasized
 geneva protocol ke pramukh bindu nimnanusaar the - The Geneva Protocol recognized 17 states
 antarrashtriya shanti kii disha main yah ek saraahneey prayaas tha, kintu britain ne iskaa anumodan nahin kiya
 For this reason, the efforts of France went in vain
 isi kaaran isaki safalataa sandigdh rahi
 Also the League of Nations had no power to impose military sanctions against the guilty state
 france kii suraksha kii samasya yathaavat rahi
 Although France was confident of security by having a small friendship with Belgium and Poland, there was a fear in her mind
 england kii ore se suraksha kaa koi thos aashwaasan nahin mila tha
 Under these circumstances, France sought to compromise Germany directly
 1922 i
 main germany ne france se aashwaasan maanga ki vah rin kshetra par akraman nahin karegaa
 The French government refused to give such an assurance
 germany ke baar-baar kehane par antat lokarna main ek antarrashtriya sammelan hua
 An important international conference was held on 5 October 1925, at a place called Locarna, Switzerland
 is sammelan main germany, france, britain, italy, belgium, poland evam checkoslovakia ke pratinidhiyon ne bhaag liya
 This was the first time after the First World War, while Germany's talks with the Allies became possible
 isse katutaa ke sthaan par sadbhaavna kaa maahaul nirmit hua
 The decisions related to Germany during the Locarna Agreement were - lokarna samjhaute main anya sandhiyaan nimnlikhit thim - 1
 Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Belgium entered into a treaty of mutual guarantee
 iske tahat uparokt rajyon ne varsay kii sandhi dwaara nishchit germany, france va belgium kii simaaon ko surakshit rakhane kii guarantee di
 It also ensured that the Rhine region would remain demilitarized
 germany-belgium evam germany-france ne aashwaasan diya ki ve ek-duusare par nimna 3 avasthaaon ke alaava akraman nahin karenge - 2
 Germany signed four separate treaties with France, Belgium, Poland and Czechoslovakia
 isamen kaha gaya ki jo vivaad shantipurvak evam kootnithik upayon dwaara na sujhalaaye ja sake unhen panch nirnay dwaara suljhaayaa jaye athwa antarrashtriya nyaayalay dwaara suljhaayaa jaye

 Two separate treaties were signed between France and Poland and France and Czechoslovakia
 imanen kaha gaya ki yadi lokarna samjhaute kaa paalan na kiya gaya, to ye raashtra german akraman kii dasha main paraspar ek-duusare kaa sahyog karenge
 In this way, negotiations started on 1 September 1925 AD in Lokarna on a total of 7 treaties and they came into force from 14 September 1926 AD
 lokarna sandhi kaa mahatv isliye hai, kyonki isamen france ko suraksha kaa aashwaasan mila evam germany ke saath samanta ke str par vaarta hui
 In fact, the terms of the Locarna Agreement were a commendable effort towards peace-making, but the fear and apprehension were clearly visible in it
 us samay kaa vaataavaran evam raajnneetigyon kii maansikta shanti kii nahin thi
 In these agreements, there were signs of establishing peace recently, but the prospects of lasting peace were not present
 bhavishya main hitler ke udai ne lokarna samjhauton kaa purna ulanghan kiya
 On August 29, 1928, the US Secretary of State Calogue and French Foreign Minister Brienne signed in Paris
 isiliye yah paris samjhauta bhi kahalata he

 tab america videsh mantri ne kaha ki iske liye aavashyak he ki sabhi bade rashtron ke madhya sahmati bane
 Efforts were made in this direction
 14 bade rashtron-england, france, austria, belgium, canada, checkoslovakia, germany, ireland, italy, japan, poland evam newjiland ne america videshi mantri kii baat ko maanate hue is samjhaute par 1928 i
 main hastakshar kar diye
 By 1930, the number of signatories reached 62, including Russia
 samjhaute kii dharaayen nimna thim - The calogue-briani agreement was like discourses in which it was said to speak the truth, not to condemn the other, but in practice no one acted on it
 yuddh kii niti kaa tyaag karne vaale is samjhaute main aatm raksha kii khatir yuddh kii anumati dena ek bhul thi
 Declaring any country as an aggressor was a difficult task
 rashtrasang ke paas sainya kaarywahi ke liye koi shakti na thi
 Therefore, by what power could economic restrictions be imposed
 is samjhaute ne france ko kuch samay ke liye raahat avashya di kintu vah bhi vaastaviktaa yah thi ki yah samjhauta chirsthayee shanti kii sthapana nahin kar saktaa tha
 Concern for the safety of France can be clearly seen in all the above mentioned agreements
 france ke pradhanmantri clemenshon ne 1919 i
 ke paris shanti sammelan kii bhoomi par varsay kii sandhi naamak hal se babul ke beej bo diye the
 Now France wanted this tree of acacia to have sweet fruit instead of thorns, which was not possible

 First and business class passengers were ordered to the rear of the aircraft and the rear passengers were asked to come forward
 kyonki vimaan puraa bharaa tha isliye yatriyon ko Since the plane was nearly full, passengers sat down in the aisles, galleys and door exits

 Safarini went back to Thexton and asked if he needed water
 thexton ne kaha - haan
 Safarini also asked if she was married and claimed that she did not like violence and all this killing, but the US and Israel had taken over their country and they could not live their life
 phir ek hijaikar ne thexton ko vaapis jane ko kaha
 The hijack episode lasted through the night

 At around 9 pm, the auxiliary power unit was shut down, all the lights were extinguished and the emergency light burned
 Passengers at the front were order toward the back, while passengers at the back were ordered forward
 Since the aisles were already full of passengers, those passengers standing just sat down
 With the plane out of power and sitting in near darkness a hijacker at the 1L door said a prayer and then aimed to shoot at the explosive belt the other hijacker at the 1R door was wearing
 The intent was to cause an explosion massive enough to kill all passengers and crew on board, as well as themselves
 Since the cabin was so dark, the hijacker missed causing only a small detonation
 Immediately the hijackers began shooting their weapons into the cabin at passengers and attempted to throw their grenades
 Yet again the lack of light caused them to not pull pins fully and create small explosions
 Ultimately it was their bullets that created most damage since each bullet would bounce off the aircraft and create crippling shrapnel
 The flight attendant at the 3L door decided it was time to take action and opened the door and although the slide did not deploy several passengers jumped down the 15 ft to the Tarmac, including crew
 The passenger that was near 3R had read the page the flight attendant earlier gave him and was able to successfully open that door
 It was the only door opened to have the slide deploy
 Ultimately this slide allowed for more passengers to evacuate safely and without injuries
 Neerja Bhanot assisted a number of passengers to escape from the flight, then she laid down her life shielding three children from the bullets fired by the terrorists
 Twenty passengers were killed and over a hundred were injured, but many escaped the ordeal including Michael Thexton, who came close to death a few hours before and returned to the UK pakistan ne turant es es ji divizan bheji tathaa army rangers ko taiyaar rahane ko kaha
 The incident escalated towards the end when the hijackers opened fire on the passengers of the aircraft
