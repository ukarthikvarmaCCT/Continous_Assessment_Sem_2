 iske saath hi saath unka doosraa uddeshy sarkari prashaskeey sansthaaon kaa adhik se adhik bhartiyakaran karne ke liye andolan chalaane kaa bhi tha
 Among the students who came in contact with him in those days and were impressed by him are the names of the famous Ferozeshah Mehta, Mohandas Karmchand Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jina
 iske atirikt dadabhai kaa ek or uddeshy british janata ko british shashan se utpeedit bharatiyon ke du:khon kii jaankaree karana or unhen dur karne ke unke uttardaayitv kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karana bhi tha
 In those days, the most difficult thing for the aspirants to join the Indian Civil Services was that they had to compete with the British candidates in adverse conditions
 is asuvidha ko dur karne ke liye dada bhai kaa suzav england or bharat main ek saath civil sarvice pariksha karne kaa tha
 For this, he campaigned till 1893 when he struggled there more than as a member of that House in the Lok Sabha and the Assembly accepted the proposal to conduct the examination simultaneously in India and England
 un dinon duusari usase bhi badi parivednaa bharatiyon kii bhayanak daridrata thi
 Although Dadabhai was not the first person who expressed anguish for it, he was the first to launch a movement to eradicate it
 unhone tathyon or aankadon se yah siddh kar diya ki jahaan bhartiya daridrata main aakanth duube the, vahiin bharat kii prashaskeey seva duniyaan main sabase mahangi thi
 Government statistics were not the same in those days and there was no non-official means to get information
 bharatiyon kii aarthik sthiti ke sambandh main praarambhik surveykshan ke baad yahi nishkarsh niklaa ki desh main ek vyakti kii ausat vaarshik aay kul bees rupye thi
 On the basis of all these figures, in front of the East India Association, he read the essay "wants and Means on India" on 27 July 1870
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak dadabhai ne anek samitiyon or aayogon ke samaksh hi nahin varan british parliament ke saamne bhi bharat ke prati kii gai buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye vakaalat kii or ucchadhikariyon ko baraabar chetavanee dete rahe ki yadi isi prakaar bharat kii naitik or bhautik rup se avnati hoti rahi to bharatiyon ko british vastuon kaa hi nahin varan british shashan kaa bhi bahishkaar karne ke liye baadhya hona padegaa, kintu iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa
 In the end, he decided to make a great effort to attract the attention of world public opinion towards the political slavery and pitiable situation of Indians, which resulted in his magnum opus Poverty and un-british Rule in India
 isamen bahut se lekh, bhaashan, niabandh or ucchadhikariyon se patravyavhaar tathaa samitiyon or aayogon ke samaksh di gai unki gavaahiyaan tathaa kitne hi mahatvapurn adhiniyamon or ghoshnaaon ke uddhran the
 His amazing success in gaining membership of the House of Commons was merely a means for goal-seeking
 unka yah lakshya yaa dhyey tha bharat kaa kalyaan or unnati jo sansad kii sadsyta ke liye sangharsh karte samay bhi unke mastishk par chaaya rahata tha
 He continued to campaign for the National Congress and in various letters to his friends in India condemned the Zoroastrian tendency to stay away from the national struggle
 koi bhi saptaah aisa nahin bitta tha jisamen unke paas bharat se patr or congress ke sambandh main patrapatrikaon kii kataranen na aati rahi hon tathaa unke patr bhartiya mitron ke paas na pahonchte rahe hon
 Nobody had ever expected that Dadabhai would create such a huge stir in the House of Commons, but his activity and activism in that House seemed as if he had been familiar with the functioning of the house long before
 bharat kii daridrata, mudra or vinimay, opium yaa sharaab ke seven ke protsaahan se utpann honevaale kuprinaamon ke vishay main unke bhaashan bade aadar or dhyaan se sune jate the
 It is not possible here to describe all the many things that Dadabhai has done for the service of the country in his long life, but it is necessary to discuss the demand made by him in the Calcutta session of the All India Congress for self-government
 unhone apane bhaashan main swarajya ko mukhya sthaan diya
 During his speech, he said, we are not pleading for any grace, we only need justice
 aarambh se hi apane prayatnon ke dauraan main mujhe itani asafalataayen mili hai jo ek vyakti ko niraash hi nahin balki vidrohi bhi bana dene ke liye paryaapt thim, par main hataash nahin hua hoon or mujhe vishwaas he ki us thode se samay ke bheetar hi, jab tak mai jivit hoon, sadbhaavna, sachaai tathaa sanman se paripurna swayatt shashan kii maang ko paripurna, karanevaala samvidhan bharat ke liye sweekaar kar liya jayega
 His hope was fulfilled when he retired from public life

 In the First World War, camouflage became an essential part of war operations
 pandubbimaar upaay ke rup main yah atyant safal rahaa
 The enemy was confused with its direction and velocity by applying garish colors on merchant ships
 rahasyamay cubot kaa kya kahana, jo dekhne main vyapaaree jahaaj jaan padate the or inhen niraapad samajhakar shatru kii pandubbi jab samudraprishth par aa jaati to ye gole uglana prarambh kar dete the
 By the Second World War, the development of air reconnaissance had become so much that the importance of camouflage increased
 chhadmaavaran main sabhi laabhprad karravaayiyaan shaamil hai, jaise hawaii prekshan, photography or bambaari se bachaav, pandubbi ke khatre ko kam karnaa, shatru ko sahi aankadon kii jaankaree se vanchit rakhana, sena, top, shivi or sainik abhisthapanon ko chhipaana, hawaii jahaazon ke maidan, vayuyan ore audyogic abhisthapanon ko chhipaana yaa roopantarit karnaa, prayek sainik kii raksha karnaa, aadi
 The observer's variable should be considered while constructing a camouflage
 hawaii prekshak sabhi drishyon ke maansik chitra se anumaan lagaataa he
 The inference may be correct and also misleading
 yadi prekshak photo letaa he to photo ke kushal pareekshan se anumaan lagaate hai
 Visibility under different conditions must be considered for successful camouflage
 pradipti tathaa prekshak or lakshya ke madhya avkaash kii paardarshakta or vaishamy vichaarneey tatv hai
 The vision of the observer is affected by the change of these elements
 in tatwon ke parivartan se prekshak kii drushti prabhavit haati he
 The object is not recognized even if there is direct illumination and sufficient contrast in the mist
 dhundh kii chizon ko dekhne ke liye avarakt camere kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 During the Second World War, the Government of England had built hundreds of fake cities, airports, ships etc

 Similarly, fake airports were more raided than real airports

 In this, the airstrip is integrated with the environment

 The soldier is photographed with color and colored clothing
 udhaaharan ke taur par, khaaki vardi marubhumi main or safed vardi him pradeshon main khap jaati he
 The methods of camouflage to hide and the choice of status are both questions of equal importance
 chhipaane kii drushti se sena ko aisi prishthbhumi main rakhte hai ki sthiti ke tatwon main sena adrishy ho jaae
 At least the change in background perception is desired
 prishthbhumi kaa uttam upyog karke bina kisi prakaar ke nirmaankarya ke hi chhipav ho saktaa he
 If natural cover is sufficient, it is easy to hide and if it is sporadic, then hide the army by taking advantage of Bhupradesh's irregularity
 chhadmaavaran anushaasan aise kaaryakalapon kaa nivaran he jinamein prishthbhumi kii pratiti badal jaati he yaa sainik lakshya prakat ho jate hai
 Surplus soil and debris are obvious signs of military action, so they either hide them, or mix them with the environment
 gharon se nikalanevaale dhune ko niyantrit or vyasruth karnaa bhi paramaavashyak hota he
 Strict discipline should be followed at all costs

 The land should be taken advantage of

 There are three main methods of hiding activity and orientation: sammishran, isamen chhadmaavaran padaarth sa lakshya ko is prakaar chhipate hai ki lakshya or padaarth prishthbhumi ke ang jaan padate hai, Build protection on installation sainik mahatv ke lakshya yaa kriyalap kii nakal utarkar shatru ko bhramit karnaa
 Scattering the units is helpful in building camouflage
 bikharaav se sainik kaaryakalapon kii pahchaan kathin ho jaati he
 Vidari illustration is also a prevalent method of camouflage
 iskaa prayog jahaaj, hawaii jahaaj, tanks tathaa sthal abhisthapanon ke chhadmaavaran main kiya jaataa he
 Drawing the vessel's vividness makes its natural structure lines invisible, making it difficult to determine its direction and velocity
 sthir asainik abhisthapanon kaa bamavarshak ore hawaii toh lenevaalon se bachaana kathin samasya he
 It is almost impossible to keep large installations secret from photography
 photography se gyaat abhisthapanon ko chhadmavanan upachaar se aisa banaate hai ki bamavarshak unhen samay se pahchaan na paaen
 Needless to say that large, attention-grabbing installations such as river, road, and stadium are extremely difficult to hide and the bombers identify their targets with the help of these landmarks
 aise abhisthapanon ke chhadmaavaran ke liye yah aavashyak hota he ki in abhisthapanon kaa nirmaan karte samay hi saavdhaanee barti gai ho
 The camouflage measures used in World War II betrayed bombers and sightings
 morganirdesan radar tathaa andh bamavarshak upkarnon ke avishkaar se ab in vidhiyon se kaam nahin chal saktaa
 In the era of atomic bombs and rockets, the development of more systematic and scientific camouflage method is an essential requirement of this era

 Kshatriya,, Kshatra, Rajajnya - These four words are generally used in the meaning of the second varna and caste of Hindu society, but they have their own special meanings and sounds due to their relation to the ancestors in specific historical or social context
 'kshetra' kaa arth multah 'veery' athwa 'paritran shakti' tha
 But later the word began to denote the class that presided over other varnas through the scriptures
 vedon tathaa brahmanon main kshatreey shabd rajvarg ke arth main prayukt hua he jaatakon or ramayana, mahabharat main kshatreey shabd se samant varg or anek yuddhrat jan abhihit hue hai
 The Sanskrit word was divided into four classes called "kshas dasyon ho whole kshatriya, vaishya and shudra"
 smritiyon main kuch yudhparak janajatiyaan jaise ki kiraat, dravidu, gurjar aabhir, sabar, maalav, sivi, trigart, yauddhey, khas tathaa tangan aadi, vratya kshatreey varg ke antargat anusuchit kii gai
 Traditionally, rulers and soldiers used to be part of the Kshatriya class, whose task was to wage war to protect the society in the war period and to provide good governance in the peace period
 jase gurjar pratihaar rajvansh ne arab hamalo se bharat ko 300 varsho tak bachaay rakhaa paali bhashaa main "khatriy" kshatriya shabd kaa paryaay he
 In the Rigvedic regime, the head of the entire clan was called "rajan" and the title of Rajan was not hereditary
 kabeeley kii samiti jisamen mahilaayein bhi bhagidaar hoti thim, raja kaa sarv sahmati se chayan karti thi
 It was Rajan's duty to protect the people and livestock of the clan
 raajpurohit rajan kaa sahyogi hota tha
 In the initial phase there was no separate army but later a separate class of ruler and soldiers emerged
 us samay samaaj ke chaar varnon main vibhaajan kii pranali nahin thi
 The "purusukta" of the Rigveda describes the mythological history of the four varnas
 kuch vidwaan purushasukt ko rugveda main antahprakashit maanate hai, jo ki vaidic sahitya kii mul sanrachana ke muqaabale naveen tarkon par zyada aadhaarit he
 Since all the Indian castes are not mentioned in the Vedic society, that is, the Purusha Sukta was written to advocate the hereditary caste system
 vaikalpik vyakhya yah bhi he ki purushasukt ke alaava rugveda main anya kahin bhi "shudra" shabd kaa prayog hi nahin hua he, atah kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki purush sukt uttar- rigvaidic kaal kaa ek sangyojan tha, jo ek damankaaree or shoshak varg sanrachana ko pehle se hi astitv main hone ko nirupit va vaid banane hetu likhaa gaya tha
 Although the word "kshatriya" is not used in Purusukta, the word "rajan" has been used, yet it is considered as the first occasion in the Vedic bibliography where all the four characters of the society are used at one time and together
 "rajanya" shabd kaa prayog sambhawatah us samay raja ke sambadhiyon hetu prayukt hua mana jaataa he, jabaki yah samaaj ke ek vishisht varg ke rup main sthapit ho chuke the
 In the late stages of the Vedic period the word "rajnya" was replaced by the word "kshatriya", where the word "rajnya" indicates relation with the king and the word "kshatriya" refers to the power influence or control over a particular region
 "rajanya" shabd pramukh rup se ek hi vanshavali ke tahat pramukh sthaan ko pradarshit karata he jabaki "kshatriya" shabd shashan yaa shaasha ko
 Jaiswal argues that the word "brahman" also appears to be rare in the Rigveda, that it has come only in "purusukta" and may not have been used for a particular priestly class
 panini, patanjali, katyayan va mahabharat ke aadhaar par jaisawal maanate hai ki rajnatik varg ko rajanya naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa tha tathaa rajanya loktantrik rup se chune huye shaasha the
 Rulers selected from democratic process such as Andhak and Vrishni etc
 are considered examples in this context
 ram sharan sharma darshaate hai ki "rajanya " va "vis " ke madhya badhate huye dhruvikaran ke uparaant kaise vibhinn vansh pramukhon dwaara ek sarvamaanya mukhiya kaa chayan hota tha jiske falswaroop ek taraf shaasha varg tathaa duusari taraf "vis" jaise pruthak virgon kaa vibhedikaran utpann hota gaya
 The word Kshatriya originates from "kshatra" which means cosmic authority and power, it has less to do with a successful leader in war and more on the tangible power to claim sovereignty over a region
 yah anuvaanshik kabeeley kii bhoomi par swaamitv kaa pratik he
 There is a difference of opinion on the social status of the Kshatriyas in the Brahmin era
 "panchavinsh brahman " ke anusaar rajanya kaa sthaan sarvocch he tathaa brahman va vaisya usase neeche kii shrenee main hai
 According to "shatapatha Brahmana 13
8
3
11", Rajyana comes second after Brahmin and Vaishya
 shatapath brahman main varna kram -brahman, vaisya, rajanya va shudra he
 The order of the current Brahminical tradition - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras, became stable after the theology period
 buddha kaal main praayah kshatriya utkrisht varg mana gaya
 In Hindu society, there has always been a rivalry between Brahmins and Kshatriyas for primacy, but only Rajput society is recognized as the highest varna

 bhartiya film ke itihaas main yah pehali baar hua he, jab kisi film ke liye ek nai bhashaa kaa nirmaan kiya gaya ho
 Queen Shivagami of Mahishmati, one of the ancient kingdoms of India, comes out to adopt a baby from the den near a huge waterfall
 vah badi nidarta se apane peechha karte sipaahiyon ko maar daalati he or shishu kii raksha khatir swayan ke praan balidaan detii he
 At the last moment, the local villagers see the baby in the arm above the queen immersed in water and save the child safely
 is tarah rani parvat kii oonchaai se girte jalprapaat main dub kar villin hoti he
 Sanga and her husband name the baby Shiva and raise their children the same way
 guzarate samay ke saath shiva ek balavaan yuvak ke rup main bada hota he jisaki aakanksha parvat chadhane kii rahati he or kai baar kii vah naakaam praytn karata he
 Every day, he gets a mask of a young woman flowing in a waterfall
 us yuvati kii pahchaan dhundne kii chaah main, vah punah parvat chadhaai kaa prayaas karata he or aakhirkaar vah safal bhi hota he
 At the summit of the falls, Shiva discovers Avantika, the owner of the facade, a rebel warrior whose team is fighting a war against King Bhallal Deva / Pallavathevan of the Mahishmati Empire through guerrilla methods
 dal kaa lakshya he ki ve purv maharani devsena ko chhudaae jinhen rajmahal main gat 25 varshon se zajiron main jakad rakhaa he
 And this important responsibility has been assigned to Avantika
 avanatika ko shiva kii yah baat sun prem hota he ki vah is jalprapaat kii tamaam mushkilon par chadhaai karata hua sirf uske liye aayaa he
 Shiva now pledges to take the responsibility of this campaign and sneak into Mahishmati and free Devasena from captivity
 shiva use chhudaa laata he or saath lekar bhaag nikalataa he magar jald hi raja kaa shahi gulam kattappa, jinhen behtareen yudhkaushal ke liye janaa jaataa he, uske peeche padataa he
 But the ambush Bhadra, son of Bhallal Dev, suddenly strikes Shiva's head, but Katappa drops his weapon when he comes to know that Shiva is actually Mahendra Bahubali, son of the late King Amarendra Bahubali
 phir yahaan bhootkaal main hue raja amrendra bahubali kii vigat ghatnaon kaa ullekh hota he
 Amarendra's mother dies after his birth, while the father passed away long before that
 shivagaamee apane angrakshak katappa ke sahyog se nae raja chune tak samrajya ke shashan kii bagdor sambhalati he
 She raises Amarendra Bahubali and Bhallal Dev equally; she is well-versed in many disciplines and training such as art, science, trickery, politics and martial arts, but both have different ambitions for the rule of the empire
 
 jahaan amrendra bahubali kaa logon ke prati udaaravaadi vyavhaar karte he to bhallaal dev behad kathor hai or apane lakshya prapti ke liye har sambhav nishthurataa baratata he, yahaan tak ki vah bahubali kii hatya bhi kara dete he
 When Mahishmati is challenged to battle by the enemy Kalakeyas, Sivagami vows that whoever beheads the king of the Kalakayas will be made the new king and thus orders for equal sharing of war between the two grandchildren
 is
 lekin bhallaal dev ke apahiz pita, bijjala dev, chal-prapanch dwaara bhallaal ko adhik se adhik yuddh saadhan muhaiyaa karaata he
 In the battle when Mahishmati fails once and realizes his end, Amarendra re-motivates his soldiers to fight against him from the dead and ends the war by crushing the enemies
 magar bhallaal dev pehle hi kalaakeya ke raja kaa vadh kar detaa he, shivagaamee bataur naye shaasha ke rup main amrendra bahubali kaa chayan uske yuddh main shreshthata or netritvta ke faisle par ghoshnaa karti he to bhallaal dev ko uske saahas or parakram ke liye senanayake banaati he
 After these earlier incidents, when questioned about King Amarendra, the emotional Katappa speaks of the death of the king, and Katappa holds himself responsible for his death

 From a system perspective, a complex network structure can break down into individual component companies
 Traditionally, companies have concentrated in the supply network on investment and product processes without worrying about the internal management of other individual players in the sector

 In the 21st century, changes in the business environment have contributed to the development of supply chain networks

 Second, technological changes, particularly the dramatic drop in the cost of information communication, which are an important component of the deals, paved the way for changes in coordination among members of the supply chain network
 
 Such supply network structures were recognized as a new organization by many researchers using terms such as "kiretsu", "extended enterprise", "virtual corporation", "global production network" and "next generation manufacturing system" is

 Although the use of global sources in organizations' supply chains can be pursued for decades, it was not until the 1980s that a large number of organizations began to integrate global sources into their core businesses
 Organizations illustrate the characteristics of this era by globalizing supply chain management with the goal of increasing their competitive advantage, adding value, and reducing costs through global outsourcing

 visheshgyata yug - pehla charan: outsource kiye gaye vinirmaan or vitaran In the 1990s, industries began to focus on "core competencies" and adopted a specialization model
 The companies abandoned vertical integration, sold non-core campaigns cheaply and contracted them to outsiders for those tasks
 This changed the management requirements by expanding the company's cross-border supply chain and distributing participation in specialized supply chain management
 is len-dein ne har sambandhit sanghathan ke moolbhoot drushtikon ko phir se kendrit kiya
 oems became the owners of the brand, requiring deep visibility into their supply base
 They have to control the entire supply chain from within rather than from the various parts of multiple oems, including number list schemes to contract manufacturers and visibility of processed work and to help customer requests for vendor managed inventory

 Each group of partners may change depending on the outcome of the diffusion of business partnership environments according to a given market, region, or channel, with their own unique characteristics and demands

 visheshgyata yug — charan do : ek seva ke rup main aapurti shrunkhlaa prabandhan Expertise in the supply chain began in the 1980s with the introduction of transport brokerage, warehouse management and non-asset based carriers and matured beyond aspects such as supply planning, collaboration, execution and performance management of transportation and operating systems

 This variability has a significant impact on the complex requirements including the configuration of processes and inward work between business partners, which are essential for network management in their own right, establishing the level of electronic communication and managing the supply chain infrastructure

 In firms where there is worldwide expansion of operations, outsourcing must be managed on a universal basis
 The intended results point to a good relationship, where both parties benefit and require a reduction in time for design-cycle and product-development

 Resource planning, supply sources, compromise, order planning, inbound transportation, storage, handling and quality assurance, many of which involve the responsibility of coordinating with suppliers on time matters, continuity of supply, security arrangements and research into new sources or programs Activities involving obtaining products and materials from external suppliers
 yahaan, bazaar main samay kam karne ke liye utpaada-vikaas kii prakriya main upabhoktaaon or aapurtikartaaon ko ekikrut kiya janaa zaruri he
 The life cycle of the product is short, so in order to stay competitive, it is necessary to develop the appropriate products in the shortest possible time and successfully market them

 graahakon kii maangon ko just-in-time arthath sahi samay par nunatam khep aakaaron main puraa kiya jaataa he
 In addition, reducing manufacturing cycle change time cycle means improving responsiveness and efficiency in meeting customer demand
 bhandaaran prakriya ke kaam, saaj-sambhaal, parivahan or nirmaan sthalon main ghatakon or maal ke bhugolic samanvay main charanbaddh samay kaa adhiktam lacheelaapan or bhautik vitaran ke parichaalan main antim sangyojan kaa sthagan jaisi gatividhiyaan niyojan, samay sarini or nirmaan kaaryon kaa samarthan se sambandhit hai
 It is concerned with providing service to the finished product / customers
 bhautik vitaran main, graahak vipanan channel kaa antim lakshya he or utpaada / seva kii uplabdhta har bhagidaar channel ke vipanan prayaas kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa he
 The time and place of customer service also became an integral part of marketing through the physical delivery process whereby it connects a marketing channel with its customers
 yah sirf saamagree or upkarnon kii kharid kaa outsorcing nahin he, balki yah un sevaaon kii bhi outsorcing he jo paramparaagat rup se in-house arthath kisi company ke andar hi pradaan kii jaati he
 The rationale of this trend is that in the value chain, the company will pay more attention to the activities where it has special benefits and it will outsource everything else
 Such activity is particularly evident in operating systems, where the provision of transportation, storage and cargo control is passed on to a large number of specialists or operating system partners
 iske alaava, bhagidaaron or aapurtikartaaon ke is network kaa prabandhan or niyantran ko kendriya or sthaneey judaav ke achche sammishran kii aavashyaktaa he
 Therefore, strategic decisions need to be taken centrally with monitoring and controlling the performance of the supplier and daily interaction with locally operating system partners will be the best management

 These principles include the following: aapurti shrunkhlaa nirantarata aapurti shrunkhlaa kii companiyaan yaa prachaalan tantra network se prabhavit karne vaala ek vyapaarik mudda he or aksar SECH reating kii tulana dwaara isaki maatra nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 SECH ratings are defined as social, moral, cultural and health footprints
 upabhokta apni khariddaari ke maahaul ke prabhaav ke prati or adhik jaagruk ho gaye he or gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke saath companiyaan SECH reating ke prati, vyavasthit dhang, jaivik prakriya se ugaaye gaye khadyapadaarth, factri virdohi shram code or sthaneey rup se nirmit vastuon kaa khaadya padaarth main badlaav ke liye agenda tay kar rahe hai jo swatantra or chote vyavsaay kaa samarthan karata he
 Because the supply chain often accounts for the carbon footprint of more than 75% of companies, many organizations are looking for ways to reduce it so that their SECH status can be improved
 SCM ke prabandhan ke ghatak The SCM component is the third element of the four-class operational framework
 ekikaran str or vyapaar prakriya ke prabandhan kii kadi kam se adhik ke kram main ghatakon se judy sankhya or str ke kaary kii kadi he
 
 As a result, adding more components to the management or increasing the level of each component can increase the level of integration of the business process link

 Lambert and Cooper have identified the following components: baharhaal, vartmaan saamagree ko saavdhaanee se jaancha jaae to is bare main or adhik vyapak samaj paidaa hogi ki aapurti shrunkhlaa ghatakon ke koun-se mahatvapurn ghatak hone chahie or pehle pahachaani gayi aapurti shrunkhlaa vyavsaay prakriyaaon kii "shakhaon", jo ki, aapurtikartaaon or graahakon se jude kis tarah ke sambandh ghatakon main ho sakate hai, ke bare main bhi samaj banegi
 boversox or close ne kaha he ki sahyog, jo sahakriyavaad kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, par jor sanyukt uplabdhi ke ucchtam str par le jaataa he
 a primary level channel partner is a business that is willing to participate in the ownership responsibility of goods or assume other aspects of financial risk, in a manner in which it becomes a primary level component
 
 ek gaun stareey bhagidaar ek vyavsaay he jo ki praathmik pratibhaagiyon ke liye aavashyak sevaayen pradaan karne ke dwaara channel rishton main bhaag letaa he
 It also includes secondary level components, which help primary participants
 tisare str ke channel pratibhaagi or ghatak praathmik str ke channel pratibhaagiyon kii sahaayta karte hai or isamen gaun str ke ghatakon kii moulik shakhaon ko bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 As a result, the supply chain components of Lumbert and Cooper do not lead to a conclusion as to what are the primary or secondary levels of supply chain components
 That is, which supply chain components should be viewed as primary or secondary, how to prepare these components to make the supply chain structure more comprehensive, and how to test the supply chain in an integrated manner
 vipareet aapurti shrunkhlaa vipareet prachaalan tantra, maal kii vaapasi prabandhan kii prakriya he

 jab 14 saal kii umr main ve maan baniin or unki ekmaatr santan kii mrityu 10 dinon main hi gai to unhen bahut bada aghat laga
 After losing her child, she vowed that she would one day become a doctor and try to prevent such untimely deaths
 unke pati gopalrav ne bhi unako bharpoor sahyog diya or unki hausalafajai kii
 Anandibai Joshi's personality is an inspiration to women
 unhone san 1886 main apane sapane ko saakaar rup diya
 When he took this decision, he was severely criticized in the society that a married Hindu woman should go abroad to study doctor
 lekin anandibai ek drudhnishchayi mahila thim or unhone aalochanaon kii tanik bhi parvaah nahin kii
 This is the reason that she has the distinction of being the first Indian female doctor
 degree puri karne ke baad jab anandibai bharat waapas lautin to unka swasthya bigadane laga or baees varsh kii alpaayu main hi unki mrityu ho gai
 It is true that Anandibai did not succeed fully in the purpose for which she obtained her medical degree, but she attained the position in the society, which is an example even today
 gopalrav ne anandibai ko doctorl kaa adhyayan karne ke liye protsaahit kiya
 In 1880 he sent a letter to a famous American missionary, Royal Wilder, in which he explained Anandibai's interest in drug studies in the United States and inquired about a suitable position for herself in America
 wilder ne unke princeton kii mishanri samiksha main patrachaar prakashit kiya
 Thodicia Carpenter, a resident of Roselle, New Jersey, read this while waiting for her dentist

 Theodicia sent her medicines from the US, without consequence
 1883 main gopalrav ko serampur main sthanantarit kar diya gaya tha, or unhone kamjor swasthya ke baavjood medical adhyayan ke liye anandibai ko america bhejne kaa faisla kiya or gopalrav ne unhen ucch shiksha ke liye anya mahilaon ke liye udhaaharan banane ke liye kaha
 a medical couple named Thorborn suggested Anandibai apply to the Women's College of Medicine in Pennsylvania
 pashchim main ucch shiksha hasil karne ke liye anandibai kii yojanaon ke bare main jaanane par, roodhiwaadee bhartiya samaaj ne unhen bahut dridhtaa se dabaa diya
 Anandibai addressed the community at Serampore College Hall, explaining her decision to move to the US and obtain a medical degree
 unhone bharat main mahila doctoron kii jarurat par bal diya or bharat main mahilaon ke liye ek medical college kholane ke apane lakshya ke bare main baat kii 
 His speech gained publicity, and financial contributions began to spread throughout India

 aanandibai ne pencylvania kii vuman medical college main apane chikitsa kaarykram main bhartee hone ke liye likhaa jo ki duniya main doosraa mahila chikitsa kaarykram tha
 Dean of the college Rachel Bodley nominated him
 aanandibai ne 19 varsh kii umr main apana chikitsa prashikshan shuru kiya
 His health deteriorated due to cold weather and unfamiliar diet in America
 unhen tapedic ho gaya tha phir bhi unhone 11 march 1885 ko emdi se snaatak kiya

 These are both from Bombay University; And passed the first class in law postgraduate courses)
 san 1897 main rande us samiti main bhi sevarat rahe, jise shahi evam prantiy vyay kaa lekha jokha rakhane evam aarthik katautiyon kaa anumodan karne kaa kaarybhaar mila tha
 For this service, he received the status of Companion of the Order of Indian Empire
 inhone san 1887 se da deccan agriculchrists relif act ke antargat vishesh nyaayadhish ke padbhaar ko bhi sambhala
 Ranade was from a staunch Chitpavan Brahmin family
 unka janm nimphad main hua or aarmabhik kaal unhone kolhapur main bitaayaa, jahaan unke pita mantri the
 After the death of his first wife, his reformers wanted him to marry a widow and save her
 parantu, unhone apane parivaar kaa maan rakhte hue, ek balika, ramabai ranade se vivaah kiya, jise baad main unhone shikshit bhi kiya
 After his death, his wife undertook his educational and social reforms
 unke koi santan nahin thi
 ---> apane mitron doytmaram pandurang, bal mangesh vaagle evam vaaman abaaji modak ke sang, ranade ne prarthana-samaaj kii sthapana kii, jo ki brahmo samaaj se prerit ek hinduvadi andolan tha
 It was based on the principles of published theism, which was based on the ancient Vedas
 prarthana samaaj maharashtra main keshav chandra sen ne armbh kiya tha, jo ek drudh brahmasamaji the
 It was originally committed to bring religious reforms in Maharashtra
 ranade saamaajik sammelan andolan ke bhi sansthaapak the, jise unhone mrityu paryant samarthan diya, jiske dwaara unhone samaaj sudhaar, jaise bal vivaah, vidhwaa mundan, vivaah ke aadambaron par baari aarthik vyay, sagarpar yatra par jaateey pratibandh ityadi kaa virodh kiya
 He laid full emphasis on widow remarriage and female education
 ranade ne pune saarvajanik sabha kii sthapana kii or baad main bhartiya rashtriya congress ke sansthaapakon main se ek bane
 He was always shown as a former opponent of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and a trusted advisor to Gopal Krishna Gokhale
 1911 ke britannika vishwakosh ke anusaar, puna saarvajanik sabha, praayah sarkaar kii yuktipurna salahon se, sahaayta karti rahi he
 In a letter to Henri Fossett, Florence Nightengale wrote: 1943 main, babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar ne, ranade kii prashansa kii, evam unhen gandhi or jinah ke virdohi kaa darja diya
 Ranade has written many articles and books on social, religious, economic and political subjects
 in rachanaaon ko anek sheershakon se sankalit kiya gaya he
 His articles titled "ranade's Economical Writing" have been edited by Vipin Chandra which was published by Gyan Books Private Limited based in New Delhi
 yah siddh karne ke liye ki unke vichaar shastron ke purnat: anuroop the, unhone vidvattapurna granth likhe, jaise 'vidhwaaon ke punarvivaah ke samarthan main veda' or 'bal vivaah ke viruddh shastron kaa mat
 ' ranade 19veen sadi ke bhartiya sudhaarwadi the
 He was opposed to revivalism
 punarutthanavaad kii simaaon ko rekhaankit karte hue unhone apane ek lekh main likhaa tha ki- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port
 In short, Ranade was not a forged bank note and in worshipping him we have no feeling of kneeling before anything that is false

 yatra udyog main, yatri kaa naam record athwa paisanger nem record ) ek computer reserveshan system ) ke databes main ek aisa record he, jisamen ek yatri yaa saath yatra karne vaale yatriyon ke samooh ke liye pathpradarshak pustak shaamil hoti he
 The PNR principle was first introduced by airlines who needed to exchange reservation information in situations when passengers needed multiple airlines to reach their destination
 To this end, IATA defined a standard for PNR content and layout
 jab ek yatri ek pathpradarshak pustak book karata he, tab yatrakarta yaa yatra website upyogkarta us computer reserveshan system main ek pienaar banaata he jise vah istemaal karata he
 This is typically a large global delivery system, such as Amadeus, Saber, worldspan or Galileo, but PNR can also be in the airline's CRS database if a booking is made directly with an airline
 is pienaar ko yatri or sambhddha pathpradarshak pustak ke liye master pienaar kaha jaataa he
 The PNR is identified by a record locator in a particular database
 jab master pienaar ke dharak dwaara yatra ke bhaag pradaan nahin kiye jate, tab pienaar jaankaree kii pratiyaan un airlinon ke siares ke paas pahunchaai jaati hai jo parivahan pradaan karte hai
 These CRS guides open copies of the original PNR in their own database to handle the parts of the book for which they are responsible
 kai airline apane siares ek jidies dwaara yojit karwaati hai, jo pienaar kii saajhedaari kii anumati detaa he
 The record locator of the copied PNR is reported back to the CRS who owns the master PNR, so that all records are tied together
 This allows the PNR to exchange updates when the travel conditions change in any CRS
 haalanki pienaar mul rup se hawaii yatra ke liye shuru kiye gaye the, par ab ye hotel, car kiraye par dene, railway aadi kii booking karwaane ke liye bhi istemaal kiye jate hai
 Colloquially, "PNR" also refers to the specific six-letter record locator used to identify records
 ek takneekee str se, booking puri karne se pehle pienaar ke paanch bhaagon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 They are: ek baar booking is str tak puri ho jaati he to siares ek adwitiya alpha-newmeric record loketor kaa prachaalan karata he, jo aage kiye gaye kisi bhi parivartan kii parvaah kiye bina samaan rahegaa vibhajit ho)
 prayek airline ek vishisht record loketor ke saath apana swayan kaa booking record banaaegi, jo sambhddha airline or siares ke bich samjhaute ke str par nirbhar hoga, yah siares par sanchaarit kiya jayega or booking main store kiya jayega
 While the above list is the minimum requirement, both the passenger and the airline need more information to ensure efficient travel
 inamen shaamil hai: In recent times, many governments now require that the airline provide more information to help investigators track criminals or terrorists
 These include: adhiktar airline yaa yatra agenciyaan ek computer riserveshan system ) yaa global vitaran system ) company jaise sabre, galileo, worldspan or amadeus se apane pienaar kii mezbaani karwaane kaa chayan karti hai
 Some privacy organizations are concerned about the amount of pnr's personal data
 jabaki ek booking puraa karne ke liye nunatam data kaaphi chota hota he, ek pienaar main aamtaur par samvedansheel prakruti kii adhik jaankaree hogi
isamen yatri kaa puraa naam, janm kii taarikh, ghar or kaam kaa pataa, telephone number, i-mail kaa pataa, credit card vivaran or saath hi apaat samparkon ke naam or vyaktigat jaankaree shaamil hogi
 "CRS-GDS companies" created to facilitate "convenient global sharing of PNR data" act as both data repositories and data aggregators and have a relationship with travel data similar to that of the lending department's financial data
 with"
 a canceled or entire travel record is not erased because "PNR copies are purified from live to archival storage systems and can be retained indefinitely by CRS, airlines, and travel agencies
" " iske alaava, siares-jidies companiyaan web site rakhti hai jo pienaar data ko lagbhag apratibandhit anumati detii hai - aksar, jaankaree tikat par chhapi aarakshan sankhya se hi uplabdh karwaai ja sakati he
 Additionally, "PNR contains detailed information about the pattern of cooperation between passengers by billing, meeting and discount eligibility codes
" pienaar main dharmanishth bhojan praathamikta or vishesh seva nivedan shaamil ho sakate hai jo shaareerik or aushadhiy halaat kii vistrut jaankaree dete hai - jaankaree kii shreneeyaan jinka europea sangh or kuch anya deshon main "samvedansheel" vyaktigat data ke rup main vishesh sangrakshit naam he
 "despite the sensitive nature of the information contained in them, pnrs are not generally considered as capable of giving as much privacy to medical and financial records
 Instead, they are viewed as commercially managed data

 In May 2004, the US government negotiated the 2004 Passenger Name Record Data Transfer Agreement Agreement - a safe harbor PNR transfer agreement with the European Commission
 In particular, the European Commission understood that the level of protection generated for such PNR transfers could meet the standard of "adequacy" required by the 1995 EU Data Directive as long as the data were used only for those purposes

 "the US-EU PNR Agreement demanded that European airlines make PNR data available to US authorities within 15 minutes of the aircraft taking off
 However, the European Court canceled the agreement on 30 May 2006 due to lack of legal authority Was, but the European Council commenced work on permanently re-starting the agreement before the 30 September 2006 court-mandate date
