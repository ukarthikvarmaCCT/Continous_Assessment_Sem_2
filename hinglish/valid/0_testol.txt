 So, as long as the plays were written in poetry, there was no particular difficulty, but in the course of time, the mode of the play took the form of prose and became realistic

 In Italy the opera was of five digits but in France it was of three digits

 paaritantr yaa paristhitik tantra ek prakritik ikai he jisamen ek kshetra vishesh ke sabhi jeevadharee, arthath paudhe, jaanavar or anujiv shaamil hai jo ki apane ajaev paryaavaran ke saath antarkriya karke ek sampoorn jaivik ikai banaate hai
 Thus ecosystems are a unit of interdependent components that divide the same habitat
 paaritantr aamtaur anek khaadya jaal banaate hai jo paristhitiki tantra ke bheetar in jeevon ke anyonyashray or urja ke pravaah ko dikhaate hai
 The term ecosystem was coined in 1930 by Roy Clapham to denote the combined physical and biological components of an environment
 british paristhitivigyaanshasri arthur tansle ne baad main, is shabd ko parishkrut karte hue yah varnan diya "yah puri pranali


 na keval jeev-parisar he, lekin vah sabhi bhautik karkon kaa puraa parisar bhi shaamil hai jise ham paryaavaran kehete hai"
 Tansley considered ecosystems not only as natural units, but also as "mental isolates"
 tansle ne baad main "ecotope" shabd ke prayog dwaara paaritantron ke sthanik had ko paribhaashit kiya
 The main idea of the ecosystem concept is that living organisms influence every other element in their local environment
 ujin odum, paristhitiki ke ek sansthaapak ne kaha:" ek ikai jisamen sabhi jeev shaamil hon jo bhautik vaataavaran ko prabhavit karen ki pranali ke bheetar urja kaa ek pravaah spasht rup se paribhaashit poshan sanrachana, biotic vibhinnata or saamagree chakra ek paristhitiki tantra he
 "the human ecosystem concept is then based on the interpretation of human / nature bifurcation and on the basis that all species are ecologically integrated with each other and with the biotic organisms of their biotopes
 biom ek paristhitiki tantra ke samaan he jisamen ek mausami or bhugolic drushti se paribhaashit kiya gaya paristhitiki samaan jalwaayu paristhitiyon ke kshetra jaise ki paudhon, pashuon ke samudaayon or mitti avyav ke rup main aksar paaritantr ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures, leaf type, plant spacing, and climate

 Biomes are often identified with particular samples of ecological sequence and climatic vegetation

 The CBD defines "ecosystem" as: "a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microbe communities and their inanimate environment that function as a functional unit
" " Along with the need to conserve ecosystems, there was a political need to describe them and identify them efficiently
 Vryugdenhil and Sab say that using a physiognomic-ecological classification system can be achieved most effectively because Ecosystems are easily identifiable on satellite images along the region
 unhone kaha ki sambandhit vanaspati ke sanrachana or mausam-tatv, paristhitik data se purit prayek aaparivartak nirdharak hai jo aanshik rup se alag set prajatiyon ko alag karte hai
 This is true not only for plant species, but also for animal species, fungi and bacteria
 paritantr ke pahchaan kii maatra fisiognomik aaparivartak ke adheen he jise ek chhavi or / yaa kshetra main pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Special fauna elements may be added where necessary, such as seasonal concentrations of animals and distribution of coral reefs
 kai fisiognomik-paristhitik vargeekaran pranaliyaan uplabdh hai: Several aquatic classification systems are available, an effort being made by the United States Geological Survey and the inter-american Biodiversity Information Network to design an entire ecosystem classification system that will cover both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
 vigyaan ke pariprekshya se, paaritantr asatat ikayan nahin hai jo keval ek "sahi" vargeekaran drushtikon kaa adhikaar par pahchaane ja sakaten hai
 An attempt by Tensley to describe or classify the ecosystem in agreement with this definition must be clear about the observer / analyst investment in classification, including normative reasoning
 "moulik jivan-aadhaar sevaayen jinpar maanav sabhyataa nirbhar karata he," or yah pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh ho unhen paristhitiki tantra sevaayen kehete hai

 Under this deterministic approach, the abstract idea of ecological health attempts to measure the robustness and recovery potential of an ecosystem, namely how far the ecosystem is away from its steady state
 aksar, haalanki, paristhitiki pranaaliyon kii kshamta ek vighatnkaaree agent se ulat aana padataa he
 The difference between collapse or a benign rebound is determined by two factors - the toxicity of the starting element and the resilience of the original ecosystem
 paaritantron mukhyatah stochastic, in ghatnaon gaiyr par pratikriyaaon bhadakaane-saamagree rahete hai or sharton unhen aasapaas ke avyavon dwaara pratikriyaaon ghatnaon sanchalit kar rahe hai
 Thus, an ecosystem results from the sum of the organism's individual responses to stimuli from the elements in this environment

 Mathematically, a greater number of different interaction factors can be demonstrated by each individual wanting to inhibit fluctuations in factors

 Stochastists identify some internal regulation mechanisms that occur in nature

 Andrewatha or santi kii he ki kshetreey vyavhaar ke str par, jahaan khaadya aapurti ek simit kaarak nahin he aabaadiyon rakhane ke liye jaataa he kaa suzav dete hai
 Therefore, stochastists view regional behavior at the ecosystem level as a regulatory mechanism rather than at the species level
 Thus, in their view, ecosystems are not regulated by the system itself and feedback mechanism and there is no such thing as a balance of nature

 In the absence of an equilibrium of nature, ecosystems have species composition, but the entire ecological collapse that will undergo change will depend on the nature of the changes that will probably be rare events

 unhone apane darbar main chun-chun kar vidwaanon, panditon, lekhakon or kalakaaron ko jagah de rakhi thi tathaa unke anubhav or gyaan kaa bharpoor sammaan karte the
 One day when they were wandering in the forest for some reason, there was some piece of conversation between the two men in their ears
 unki samaj main aa gaya ki unamem se ek jyotishi he tathaa unhone chandan kaa tikaa lagaaya or antadhryaan ho gaye
 The astrologer said to his friend- "I have acquired complete knowledge of astrology and now i can tell you everything clearly about your past, present and future
 " The second, taking no interest in his words, said- "you are fully aware of my past and present, so you can tell everything and i have no desire to know about your future
 acha hota tum apana gyaan apane tak hi simit rakhte
 "but the astrologer was not going to stop
 vah bolaa- "in bikhri hui haddiyon ko dekh rahe he
 Looking at these bones, i can tell which animal these bones belong to and what happened to the animal
 " lekin uske dost ne phir bhi uski baton main apni ruchi nahin jataai
 Then the astrologer noticed the footprints on the ground
 usne kaha- "ye pad chinh kisi raja ke hai or satyata kii jaanch tum khud kar sakate ho
 According to astrology, the lotus sign is naturally in the king's feet, which is clearly visible here
 " His friend thought that the truth should be checked, otherwise this astrologer will continue to speak
 pad chinhon kaa anusaran karte-karte ve jangal main andar aate gaye
 Where the footprints ended, there was a logger standing with an ax and cutting a tree with an ax
 jyotishi ne use apane paanv dikhaane ko kaha
 When the woodcutter showed his feet, his mind was shocked
 lakadahare ke paanvon par prakritik rup se camel ke chinh the
 When the astrologer asked him his real acquaintance, he told the woodcutter that he was born in a woodcutter's house and he is doing the same thing with many books
 jyotishi soch rahaa tha ki vah rajkul kaa he tathaa kisi paristhitivash lakadahare kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Now he started losing faith in his astrological knowledge
 uskaa dost uskaa uphaas karne laga to vah chidhkar bolaa- "chalo chalakar raja vikramaditya ke paanv dekhte hai
 If there is no lotus sign on their feet, then i will consider the whole astrology scripture as false and believe that my astrology studies have gone in vain
 " ve lakadahare ko chhod ujjain nagari ko chal pade
 Reached the palace after a long walk
 raajakmal pahunch kar unhone vikramaditya se milane kii ichha jataai
 When Vikram came to the fore, he asked him to show his leg
 vikram kaa pair dekhakar jyotishi sann rah gaya
 His feet were like the feet of ordinary humans
 un par waisi hi aadi-tirchhi rekhaayen thim
 There was no lotus mark
 jyotishi ko apane jyotish gyaan par nahi, balki puure jyotish shasr par andeh hone laga
 He said to the king- "astrology Shastra says that the person whose feet are present in the feet of the lotus will be the king but this is utterly untrue
 jiske paanvon par mainen ye chinh dekhe vah pushtaini lakadahaara he
 He has no relation with any royal family
 pet bharne ke liye ji tod mehnat karata he tathaa har sukh-suvidha se vanchit he
 On the other hand, there is a Chakravatti Emperor like you, who has everything to enjoy in his destiny
 jisaki kirkitt dur-dur tak faili hui he
 You are called the king of kings, but there is no such sign in your feet
 " raja ko hansee aa gai or unhone poocha- "kya aapkaa vishwaas apane gyaan tathaa vidya par se uth gaya?" jyotishi ne jawaab diya- "bilkul
 i can no longer believe even a ratty
 " usne raja se namratapurvak vidaa lete hue apane mitra se chalane kaa ishaara kiya
 When he was about to walk, the king asked him to stop
 donon thithak kar ruk gaye
 Vikram ordered a knife and began to scratch the soles of the feet
 khurachne par talvon kii chamadi utar gai or andar se camel ke chinh spasht ho gaye
 On seeing the astrologer shocked, Vikram said- "there is no shortage in your knowledge, o astrologer
 lekin aapkaa gyaan tab tak adhuraa rahegaa, jab tak aap apane gyaan kii dingen haankenge or jab-tab uski jaanch karte rahenge
 i had listened to you and i met you as a woodcutter in the forest
 maine aapaki vidwata kii jaanch ke liye apane paanvon par khaal chadha lee thi, taaki camel kii akruti fik jaae
 If you did not see the lotus shape at all, then your faith got up from your knowledge
 yah acchhee baat nahin hai
 " jyotishi samaj gaya raja kya kahana chaahate hai
 He decided that he would avoid the ridiculous methods of checking for true knowledge and would avoid bluntness

 aajkal bhi bharat main isi paddati se panchang banate hai, jinke aadhaar par desh bhar main dharmik krity tathaa parv manaae jate hai
 In the present day, most of the almanacs are presented by the method of Suryasiddhanta, Makaranda arrays and Grahalaghava
 kuch aise bhi panchang banate hai jinhen notical almnaak ke aadhaar par prastut kiya jaataa he, kintu inhen praaia: bhartiya nirayan paddati ke anukool bana diya jaataa he
 The oldest available literature of India is Vedic literature
 vaidic kaaleen bhartiya yajna kiya karte the
 In order to get the specific fruits of yagyas, it was necessary to do them at the prescribed time, so from the Vedic period, Indians started getting knowledge of Kaal from the positions of Sun and Moon by the Vedhas
 panchang sudharasmiti kii report main die gaye vivaran ke anusaar rugveda kaal ke aaryon ne chandra saura varshganana paddati kaa gyaan praapt kar liya tha
 They also knew the 12 lunar months and the Adhimas who associated the lunar months with the solar year
 din ko chandramaa ke nakshatra se vyakt karte the
 He had knowledge of the lunar zodiac of the lunar eclipse
 varsh ke dinon kii sankhya 366 thi, jinamein se chandra varsh ke liye 12 din gata dete the
 According to the report, the time of Rigvedic Aryans must be at least 1,200 years BC
 lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilak kii orin ke anusaar yah samay shaq sanwat se lagbhag 4000 varsh pehle thahartaa he
 In the Yajurveda period, the Indians named 12 names of the months Madhu, Madhava, Venus, Shuchi, Namas, Namasya, Ish, Urja, Sahasra, Tapas and Tapasya
 baad main yahi poornima main chandramaa ke nakshatra ke aadhaar par caitra, baishakh, jyeshtha, asadha, bhadrapada, asina, karthik, margshirsh, pus, magh tathaa phalgun ho gaye
 The complete number of constellations and the names of their superordinate deities are also found in the Yajurveda
 yajurveda main tithi tathaa pakshon, uttar tathaa dakshin ayan or vishuv din kii bhi kalpana he
 The equinox day is the day on which the sun stays at the equinox and the revolution
 shri shankar baalkrishna dikshit ke anusaar yajurveda kaalik aaryon ko guru, shukr tathaa rahu ketu kaa gyaan tha
 Scholars differ about the creation of the Yajurveda
 yadi ham paashchaatya pakshpaati, kith kaa mat bhi len to yajurveda kii rachana 600 varsh isa purv ho chuki thi
 After this comes the period of Vedang astrology, which ranges from 1,400 years BC to 400 years BC
 vedang jyotish ke anusaar paanch varshon kaa yug mana gaya he, jisamen 1830 madhya sawan din, 62 chandra maas, 1860 tithiyaan tathaa 67 nakshatra maas hote hai
 The names of the five years of the era are: Samvatsar, Parivatsar, Idavatsar, Anuvatsar and Idvatsar 1 According to this the date and lunar constellation were calculated
 iske anusaar maason ke madhya sawan dinon kii gananaa bhi kii gai he
 The important thing that we find in Vedang jyatish is the imagery of the era, in which medium date is derived by finding the medium speed based on the direct perforation of sun and moon
 aage aanevaale siddhant jyotish ke granthon main isi pranali ko apanaakar madhyam grah nikaale gaye hai
 No astrology calculations are available within Vedang Astrology and Siddhanta Astrology
 kintu is bich ke sahitya main aise pramaan milte hai jinase yah spasht he ki jyotish ke gyaan main vruddhi avashya hoti rahi he, udhaaharan ke liye, mahabharat main kai sthanon par grahon kii sthiti, grahayuti, grahayudh aadi kaa varnan he
 It is so clear that during the time of Mahabharata, Indians were familiar with the planetary perforation and their position
 siddhanth jyotish pranali se likhaa hua pratham paurush granth aryabhat pratham kii aryabhatium he
 Then there is the Siddhantpanchika, edited by Barahamihira, which has a collection of Peetamaha, Vasistha, Romak, Pulish and Suryasiddhanta
 isse yah to pataa chalata he ki barahamihir se purv ye siddhantagranth prachlit the, kintu inke nirmaankaal kaa koi nirdesh nahin he
 In general, Indian astrologers have considered them as inauspicious
 aadhunik vidwaanon ne anumaanon se inke kaalon ko nikaala he or ye paraspar bhinn hai
 It is certain that these Vedangs had become prevalent within the time of astrology and Barahamihira
 iske baad likhe gaye siddhantagranthon main mukhya hai : brahmagupta kaa brahmasiddhant, lall kaa shishydhivriddhid, shripati kaa siddhanthashekhar, bhaskaracharya kaa siddhant shiromani, ganesh kaa grahalaghav tathaa kamalaakar bhatta kaa siddhant-tatv-vivek
 There are two classifications of the texts of Mathematical Astrology: Siddhantha Granth and Karanagranth
 siddhantagranth yugadi athwa kalpadi paddati se tathaa karangranth kisi shaq ke aarambh kii gananaapaddati se likhe gaye hai
 Mathematics is the main propounding subject of astrological texts: enumeration of middle planets, enumeration of apparent planets, problems, country and time, sun and lunar eclipse, planetary, planetary, sunrise, planets of the moon, observance and interpretation of observatories
 puure vrutt kii paridhi 360 maan lee jaati he
 Its 360th part is one part, 60th part of one art, 60th part of art is one Vikala, 60th part of one Vikala is one antiquity
 30 ansh kii ek raashi hoti he
 For calculating the planets, 12 parts of the eclipse in which the Sun appears to be traveling
 in bhaagon ko mesh, vrish aadi raashiyon ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 To tell the position of the planet, from zodiac to zodiac, part, art, and development of the planet are told
 yah grah kaa bhogaansh hota he
 In the Siddhanta texts, the parts and ranges of a circle are divided by 24 parts
 inkaa maan kalatmak rahata he
 The sine of an arc of 90 is the radius of the circle, which is called the radius
 isko nimnlikhit sutara se nikaalte hai : Thus the value of the radius is 3438 art, which is adjacent to the actual value
 chaap kii jya aadhunik pranali kii tarah ardhajya he
 In fact, the present triangular results have been developed on the basis of the Indian system and Aryabhata is considered its inventor
 yadi kinhin do bhinn aakaar ke vritton ke trikoshmetiya maanon kii tulana karnaa apekshit hota he, to vrihad vrutt kii trigya tathaa abhisht vrutt kii nishpatti ke aadhaar par abhisht vrutt kii paridhi anshon main nikaali jaati he
 Thus, although the number of degrees in the new order is only 360 in slow and quick circles, the lower numbers written in theses are only for comparative calculation
 vishuvad vrutt main ek samgati se chalanevaale madhyam surya ke ek udai se duusare udai tak ek madhyam sawan din hota he
 It is similar to 'civil Day' in present-day English
 ek sawan din main 60 ghati; 1 ghati 24 minutes saath pal; 1 pal 24 senked 60 vipal tathaa dhai vipal 1 senkend hote hai
 The period of the Earth's orbit relative to a stationary point of the Sun is called the Solar Year
 yah sthir bindu meshadi he
 By the time of the fifth century of Christ, this point was in the radius and equinox
 ab yah us sthaan se lagbhag 23 pashchim hat gaya he, jise aynansh kehete hai
 Ayāngati is not the same in various texts
 yah lagbhag prati varsh 1 kala maani gai he
 The current microcosm is 50
2 percent
 siddhantagrathon kaa varshmaan 365 dipho 15 ghapoo 31 patto 31 vitho 24 prati vitho he
 This is actually a value of 8
 34
 37 Paladi is more

 Thus, due to our year old, there is more imagination of unpredictability
 varshon kii gananaa ke liye saura varsh kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For lunar months for the census
 surya or chandramaa jab raashyadi main samaan hote hai tab vah amantkaal tathaa jab 6 raashi ke antar par hote hai tab vah poornimantkaal kehalaata he
 There is a lunar month from one moon to another, but the condition is that the sun must come from one zodiac to another at that time
 jis chandra maas main surya kii sankranti nahin padati vah adhimaas kehalaata he
 In such a year, there are 13 months instead of 12
 isi prakaar yadi kisi chandra maas main do sankrantiyaan pad jaayan to ek maas kaa kshay ho jayega
 In this way, the system is associated with the solar system even when the measurements are moon
 chandra din kii ikai ko tithi kehete hai
 It is equal to the 12th of the difference between the Sun and the Moon
 hamaare dharmik din tithiyon se sambhddha he1 chandramaa jis nakshatra main rahata he use chandra nakshatra kehete hai
 In ancient times, lunar constellations were used in place of war
 kaal ke bade maanon ko vyakt karne ke liye yug pranali apanaai jaati he
 that goes: suryasiddhant main bataae aankadon ke anusaar kaliyug kaa aarambh 17 farvari 3102 itho puchho ko hua tha
 The calculation system of Ego from the era, similar to the days of Julian Day number, can be helpful in calculating past and future dates
 grah kii meshadi ke saapeksh prithvi kii parikrama ko ek bhagan kehete hai
 In the Siddhanta texts, there are fractures between yugas, or kalpagrahs
 yug yaa kalp ke madhya sawan dinon kii sankhya bhi di rahati he
 If the planets are in Ariesadi at the beginning of Yuga or Kalpa, then the middle planet can be removed from the Triassic by knowing the middle day
 bhagan kii paribhaasha ke anusaar budh or shukr kii madhyam gati surya ke samaan hi maani gai he
 His speed is comparable to his actual speed
 ye grah rekhadesh, arthath ujjayini, ke yamyottar ke aate hai, jinhen deshaantar tathaa char sanskaron se apane sthaan ke mayam saryodayasannakaalik banaaya jaataa he
 When the apparent speed of the apparent sun and the moon is at its lowest, the portion of the apparent sun and moon at that time should be considered as the enjoyment of their light
 spasht ravi chandra or madhyam ravi chandra ke antar ko mandafal kehete hai
 Mandnech will be 180 from Mandotch
 mandoch se chah raashi tak spasht surya chandra madhyam surya chandra se peeche rahete hai
 That is why slow fruit is negative
 mandoch se madhyam grah ke antar kii mandakentre sangya he
 At the difference of 3 zodiacs from the retarded, the bradycardia is perishable
 use mandantya fal kehete hai
 The apparent planet from Mendeich to Mendoch is ahead of the middle planet, hence Mandafal is wealth
 mandaspasht ravi chandra ke mandafal ko gyaat karne ke liye do prakaar ke kshetron kii kalpana he, jinhen bhangi kehete hai
 The name of the first is the circumcision
 bhu ko centre maanakar ek trigya ke vyasaradh se vrutt khinchaa, vah kakshavritt hua
 Drawing a circle with a radius diameter from its center, cut as the sine of the dimer at its vertical diameter, it will be retarded
 madhyam grah ko mandprativrutt main chalata kalpit kiya
 If you cut an arc equal to the center of the orbit even in the orbit, then there will be a middle planet in the orbit
 bhucendre se prativrutt sthit grah tak khinchi gai rekha kakshavritt main jahow lage vah mandaspasht grah hoga
 The difference between the medium and dim planets of the orbit will be retarded
 nichoch bhangi ke liye kakshavritt par sthit madhyam grah se mandantyafaljya tulya vyasaradh se ek vrutt khinch lete hai, jise mandaparidhi vrutt kehete hai
 a line going from the center of the orbit to the middle planet, where it is in the diagonal, is assumed to be dim, in the opposite direction in the dim periphery, the planets are imagined at the fractions of the center
 grah se bhucendre ko milaanevaali rekha jis sthaan par kakshavritt ko kaate vahaan mandaspasht grah hoga
 In this way, the dim sun and the moon show us at those places, because their sight is visible to us in relation to the earth
 shesh grahon ke liye bhi mandafal nikaalane kii waisi hi kalpana he
 Their dimorphs are made known by the illumination of the apparent planet by knowledge of the mentals
 ye mandaspasht grah drishy nahin hote, kyonki prithvi unke bhraman kaa centre nahin he
 It is clear from the above discussion that the dim planet is the enjoyment of the planet revolving in its orbit
 atev bhudrishy banane ke liye paanch grahon ke liye sheeghra fal kii kalpana kii gai he
 To clarify Mars, Mercury, Guru, Venus, and Saturn, an early fruit is conceived

 Only the actual Madhyamgrahs for ingestions are called Jyotrikh
 unke madhya adhiktam ravigrahantar kone ko paramshighrafal, paramshighrafal kii jya ko shighranty faljya kehete hai
 The difference between the planet and the astral is the quick center
 isamen mandafal ke liye banaai gai bhangiyon kii tarah bhangiyaan banaakar shighrafal nikaala jaataa he
 With this type of rite, the position of the planet is known by making a favorable angle of the planet
 bahirgrahon ke liye ravikendrik paramalamban kii paramshighrafal tathaa ravi ko shighrochch maanakar shighrafal gyaat kiya jaataa he
 Acharyas have prescribed the method of sacrament of the early fruit in such a way that the enjoyment of the available planet can come true
 grahon kii kakshaayen chandra, budh, shukr, ravi, bhoum, guru, shani ke kram se uttarottar prithvi se dur hai
 Their center is believed to be Earth 1
 Although the radius of each orbit for the means of the planets is assumed to be radius equal, their distance varies because of their diffusivity
 shighrantyafalajyaon or trigyaon kii grahakakshavyasaardhan or ravikkshavyasaradh se tulana karne par budh, shukr, mangal, brihaspati tathaa shani kii kakshaon ke vyasaradh prithvi se ravi kii duuri ke saapeksh

 The ranking of the teams at the beginning of the Cricket World Cup was as follows: note: team 12-16 ke paas vishwa cap main jane ke liye adhikarik ODI ranking nahin thi; unki ranking toornament se pehle purnakalik sadasyon ke khilaaf unki jeet kii pratishtata ke aadhaar par or sahyogi sadasyon ke khilaaf jeet ke aadhaar par kii gayi
 All 16 nations played a series of practice matches to prepare before the main tournament, experimenting on different strategies and helping them adapt to the West Indies situation
 These practice matches were not considered official odis
 These matches were played from Monday 5 March to Friday 9 March

 The opening ceremony of the Cricket World Cup 2007 was held on Sunday, 11 March 2007 at Trelawney Stadium, Jamaica
 isamen 2000 se adhik nartakon or kalakaaron ne west indes ke sangeet ke bhinn roopon ko prastut kiya, jisamen calipso, ragga tu regge or soka shaamil the; ye kalakaar the seen paul, byran lee, kevin little, berrej hemand, lucky dube, buju benton, half pint, ero, machel montano, ellison hinds, tony rebel, third world, grigori ijac, david rudar, sheggi, da ai thrij or jimmy cliff
 The ceremony was attended by several prominent personalities of the state, including the governor-general of Jamaica, beginning with Sir Garfield Sobers' address; Which included messages from the Prime Ministers of Jamaica and Granada
 sabhi match 0930 se 1715 ke bich sthaneey samay ke anusaar hue
pehali pari 0930 se 1300 tak or duusari pari 1345 se 1715 tak kheli gayi
 jamaica ke alaava anya sabhi sthanon ke liye sthaneey samay UTC-4 tha, jabaki jamaica ke sthanon main sthaneey samay UTC-5 tha
 The matches were one-day internationals and were conducted under normal ODI rules
 All matches were to be played by each side for 50 overs, unless the umpire or match referee makes another announcement
 ek gendbaaj har match main adhiktam 10 over ke liye gendbaaji kar saktaa tha
 In the event of inclement weather, each side had to play at least 20 overs so that a result could be announced
 In the event of inclement weather, the Duckworth – Lewis method was applied to declare the results
 nirdhaarit din par koi parinaam ghoshit na hone kii sthiti main, tiimon ko khel puraa karne ke liye agle din phir se khelnaa tha, iske liye yah nirdhaarit tha ki sthitiyaan usee tarah kii tarah rahengi jahaan se khel ko choda gaya tha
 a new rule of official TV replays was made to decide the catch: If the standing umpire could not decide whether the catch was taken clearly and / or the ball that claimed the catch
 If there is a "bump ball", they have to accept the decision of the third umpire
 Also, when replaying such a catch by TV replays, if the third umpire clearly knows that the batsman did not hit the ball, the batsman will be declared not out
 group avasthaa or super 8 avasthaa main nimnanusaar ank die gaye: The top two teams from each group advanced to the Super 8 and any points their group scored in the match with the second seed added to their group's points
 Those points earned in the match with the unseeded teams
 It was not added to further
 In Super 8, each team played matches with the six seeded teams of the other group and the top four teams advanced to the semifinals
 The position was determined on the basis of highest marks
 Where two or more teams were tied on points, the following method was used for which team would advance

 Apart from that defeat, Australia has won every World Cup match played against Sri Lanka
 In this match, Sri Lanka entered the final of the World Cup for the second time and Australia entered the sixth time and fourth time in the sequence

 At the end of 33 overs, the Sri Lankan team was still trailing by 37 runs from the target, according to the duckworth-lewis method, when the umpires suspended the game due to poor lighting
 At that time the players of Australia started celebrating their victory, the umpires declared that the match was suspended due to light and not rain, so the last three overs would be bowled the next day
 Sri Lanka were required to score 61 off 18 balls, with Mahela Jayawardene agreeing that there was no need to return the next day and instructed his team to bat, while Ricky Ponting agreed that only Spinnar Will put the ball
 In the matter, the umpires apologized for their mistake and said that the match should be ended, so that Australia would win by 37 runs

 The 2007 World Cup organizers have already been criticized for being too over-vocalized and, in particular, fewer people to accuse the ICC of security restrictions, some of the issues were outside food, signs, replica kits and contrary to Caribbean cricket beliefs Musical instruments, as well as authorities were accused of "fleeing the city instead of focusing on the cleanliness of the city"
 Less addressed
 The ICC was also accused of high ticket prices and concessions, which were said to be out of reach of the local public in many places
 Malcolm Speed, CEO of ICC, said the ICC recognized the problem but said it was the fault of the local organizers
 haalanki, jaise jaise toornament aage baadha, baad ke maichon main bheed bad gayi, kyonki sthaneey aayojakon ne pratibandhon ko kam kar diya tha

 BCCI ne baad main daawa kiya ki yah is baat par dhyaan degi ki ICC 2011 cricket vishwa cap ke liye vishwa cap praaroop main parivartan kare
 The tournament was also criticized for being too long
 In 6 weeks, it reached the same period as the 2003 World Cup, but reached the length of the 1999 World Cup over 5 weeks and the 1996 World Cup in 4 weeks

 The foul was then criticized at the end of the final match, during which the umpire suspended the game due to poor lighting and while the official announcement and scoreboard were declaring Australia the winner and Australia's team started celebrating Dia, then the umpire said that the game is suspended, not complete and 3 overs are to be played
 And despite the poor light, Sri Lanka batted for 3 overs following a polite agreement between the two captains
 The umpires and the ICC apologized for this unnecessary situation and called it an unnecessary fundamental error due to the pressure of the situation
 In June, the ICC announced that officials involved in the field - umpires Steve Buckner and Aleem Dar, reserve umpires Rudy Koertzen and Billy Boden, and match referee Jeff Crowe — would all be suspended from the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship

 a dometer or galvanometer is a type of ammeter
 yah kisi paripath main dhara kii upasthiti kaa pataa karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Often ampere, volt or ohm marks are not placed on it
 Current senstivity-cs-nab \ ksi unit of current senstivity is Radian / Ampiar There can be many types of photometer sparshajya dharamapi sabase saral or upyogi chalchumbak dharamapi he
 There is a circular coil of insulating copper wire on the vertical structure of an non-magnetic material
 kundali main praaia: 552 chakkar hote hai, jisamen 2, 50 or 500 chakkaron ke baad sanyojak pench lage rahete hai
 With their help, you can work with fewer or more rounds as needed
 vrittakar kundali ko urdhwadhar aksh ke chaaron ore ghumaya ja saktaa he
 a magnetic needle rests on the vertical rivet at the center of the coil and a long indicator of aluminum perpendicular to the needle, which rotates along the needle on a horizontal circular scale and deflects the magnetic needle
 yah scale chaar chaturthaanshon main vibhajit rahata he or prayek chaturthaansh main 0 degree se 90 degree tak ke chihn hote hai
 When the magnetic needle is in the magnetic meridian, the indicator remains at zero degree
 dhara naapane ke purv dharamapi ke aadhaar ko kshaitij kar lete hai or kundali ke samtal ko ghumaakar chumbakeey yamyottar main le aate hai
 In this case, the magnetic needle boxes are positioned in a depressed position at the center of the coil and also see that both ends of the indicator are located at 0 ° - 0 °
 Now connect the two connective screws of the dielectric to the circuit
 In which the current flows
 urdhwadhar kundali main dhara ke pravaahit hote hi, ek chumbakeey kshetra utpann ho jaataa he, jo parthiv kshaitij chumbakeey kshetra se samakon banaata he
 Due to both of those magnetic fields, two opposing forces on the magnetic needle work
 sooyee vikshepit hokar aisi dasha main ruk jaati he jahaan donon balyugmon kaa ghurna baraabar hota he
 If the needle deflection is Q, the current value is determined by the following formula: arthath dharamapi main bahanevaali dhara vikshep kone ke sparshajya ke samaanupati hoti he
 The change of constant dielectric is called multiplier
 parivartan gunak ampiore main napa jaati he
 This is equivalent to an electric current that can produce a 45 degree deflection in the needle of a dielectric
 is prakaar kaa saral sparshajya dharamapi yathesht rup se sookshmagrahi or yatharth nahin hota
 Particularly due to the current, the intensity of the magnetic field is not the same at both poles of the magnetic needle
 is kaaran dharaman main truti ho jaati he, kyonki sutara isi par nirbhar he ki donon dhruvon par chumbakeey kshetra ek sa ho
 Therefore, based on this principle, a second thermometer was called, Helmholts galvanometer
 is dharamapi main yah truti nahin hoti or yah saral sparshajya dharamapi se adhik sookshmagrahi hota he
 It consists of circular coils on two vertical structures of non-magnetic material
 unke kendron ke bich kii duuri unke ardhavyas ke baraabar hoti he
 The magnetic needle box is placed exactly on the horizontal axis of both the coils
 donon kundaliyon ke taar is prakaar jod die jate hai ki jab unamem dhara pravaahit ho tab donon se utpann chumbakeey kshetra ek hi disha main hon
 In this case, the magnetic field produced by the ground near the magnetic needle becomes more intense and it can also be proved that the intensity of this field remains the same at both ends of the needle
 is parivartan ke falswaroop yah dharamapi adhik sookshmagrahi or yatharth ho jaataa he
 Before measuring the current, it is necessary to horizontal the plane of the needle box and the vertical coils in the magnetic meridian
 is samanjan ke baad jab dharamapi kii kundaliyon main dhara pravaahit kii jaati he or chumbakeey sooyee main kone kaa vikshep hota he, tab dhara kaa maan nimna sutara se gyaat hota he : g is called the change multiplier of Helmholt's photometer
 yah dharamapi bhi yathesht rup se sookshmagrahi nahin hota
 a new theory is used to make more sensitive perforators
 vah yah he ki yadi parthiv chumbakeey kshetra kaa prabhaav chumbakeey sooyee par kam kar diya jaae, to kisi bhi dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey sooyee main pehle se adhik vikshep hoga, arthath yantra adhik sookshmagrahi ho jayega
 This is called the principle of inertial pairing
 yadi do lagbhag baraabar chumbakeey ghurna vaale chumbakon ko ek drudh chad se aisa joda jaae ki ve ek duusare ke samaantar hon or unke vipareet dhruv paas paas hon, to unhen asthaitik yugma kehete hai
 In this pair, opposite poles of both magnets are close by, hence the effect of earth magnetic field has little effect on this pair
 taar kii kundali yaa kundaliyaan ek chumbak yaa donon chumbak ke chaaron ore is prakaar lapeti jaati hai ki unamem dhara bahane par chumbakon par ek hi disha main balyugma lage
 In this case if there is also a low current in the coil, there is more deflection in the magnetic pair
 is prakaar ke dharamapi ati sookshmagrahi hote hai
 If this magnetic pair is hung by a spindleless pendant and a small mirror is attached to this pendant, a very small deflection can be measured by the light beam
 prakaash kii kirane lamp se chalakar dharamapi ke darpan se paravartit hokar ek lens dwaara scale par focus main aati hai
 When there is a deflection in the magnetic pair due to current flow and the mirror rotates by angle Q, the reflected light rays rotate at angle 2Q and transfer to the lightpoint on the scale
 is vidhi se sooyee kaa ati sookshm vikshep napa ja saktaa he or iske falswaroop is dharamapi se ati sookshm dhara naapi ja sakati he
 The inertial magnetic pair has been used in many different types of currents
 kelvin dharamapi, pashen dharamapi or broka dharamapi inke kuch udhaaharan hai
 a current of 10-12 amperes can be measured from these currents
 jalchumbak dharamapi, vishesh kar asthaitik dharamapi, atyam sookshmagrahi hote hai, parantu inkaa prayog asuvidhajanak hota he
 They are also temporary
 yahi kaaran he ki ve bahut kam prayukt hote hai
 Most chalkandi dharampati is used, as they are permanent, simple and convenient in addition to being sufficiently sensitive

 Thus, the distance of the Sun from Earth was a quarter to eight light minutes
 jin taron se prakaash aath hajaar varshon main aata he, unki duuri hamane paune santalis padam mile aanki he
 But the stars are so far away that it takes millions, crores, billions of years for light to come from them

 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed

 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times

 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization

 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established

 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization

 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world

 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction

 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826

 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15

 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storehouse
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign

 Bull-cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and boar were reared

 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves

 ye afghanistan or iran se vyapaar karte the
 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic

 Nagarjuna, a writer of many languages and a progressive ideologue, also composed original works in Maithili Sanskrit and Bala in addition to Hindi and also translated works from Sanskrit, Maithili and Bala
 sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit nagarjun ne maithili main yatri upnaam se likhaa tathaa yah upnaam unke mul naam vaidyanath mishra ke saath milakar ekmec ho gaya
 Nagarjuna was born on 1917 AD Jyestha Purnima in Satlakha in present Madhubani district
 yah un kaa nanihaal tha
 His ancestral village was Tarauni in the present Darbhanga district
 inke pita kaa naam gokul mishra or mata kaa naam uma devi tha
 Nagarjuna's childhood name was 'thakkan Misr'
 darasal baat yah thi ki gokul mishra or uma devi ko lagaataar chaar santane huin or asamay hi ve sab chal bases
 Gokul Mishra was living in a very depressed life due to not having children
 ashikshit brahman gokul mishra ishwar ke prati aasthavan to swaabhaavik rup se the hi par un dinon apane aradhy dev shankar bhagwaan kii puja zyada hi karne lage the
 After going to Vaidyanath Dham, he worshiped Baba Vaidyanath as much as he could and after returning from there, he started spending time in the house in worship
 "phir jo paanchavin santan hui to man main yah ashanka bhi panpi ki chaar santanon kii tarah yah bhi kuch samay main thagkar chal basegaa
 Hence it came to be known as 'thakkan'
 kaaphi dinon ke baad is thakkan kaa namakaran hua or baba vaidyanath kii krupa-prasad maanakar is balak kaa naam vaidyanath mishra rakhaa gaya
 " gokul mishra kii aarthik sthiti acchhee nahin rah gayi thi
 They did not do any work
 sari jameen batai par de rakhi thi or jab upaj kam ho jane se kathinaaiyaan utpann huin to unhen jameen bechney kaa chaska lag gaya
 Many types of wrong habits were maintained by selling land
 jivan ke antim samay main gokul mishra apane uttaradhikari ke liye maatr teen kattha upjau bhoomi or praayah utani hi vaas-bhoomi chhod gayi, vah bhi sood-bharna lagaakar
 Much later, the Nagarjuna couple rescued him
 aisi paariwarik sthiti main balak vaidyanath mishra palane-badhane lage
 His mother died at the age of six
 inke pita apane ek maatr maatruhin putr ko kandhe par baitaakar apane sambandhiyon ke yahan, is gaanv--us gaanv aayaa-jaaya karte the
 In this way, in childhood, he got into the habit of walking due to the helplessness of his father and growing up became a natural part of his life
 "ghumkkadi kaa anu jo balykaal main hi sharir ke andar pravesh paa gaya, vah rachana-dharm kii tarah hi viksit or pusht hota gaya
 " vaidyanath mishra kii aarambhik shiksha ukt paariwarik sthiti main laghu siddhant kaumudi or amarkosh ke sahare aarambh hui

 "and he was actually arrested in connection with this movement before the emergency and then spent a lot of time in jail
 1948 i0 main pehali baar nagarjun par dama kaa hamalaa hua or phir kabhi thik se ilaaj na karaane ke kaaran aaajeevan ve samay-samay par isse peedit hote rahe
 Nagarjuna, having a full family of two daughters and four sons, could never carry out the Gharshya Dharma properly and the same three kathas inherited as immovable property remained fertile and often the same habitat land
 nagarjun kaa asli naam vaidyanath mishra tha parantu hindi sahitya main unhone nagarjun tathaa maithili main yatri upnaam se rachanaayen kin
 While in Kashi, he also wrote poems under the nickname 'vaideh'

 Initially, his Hindi poems were also printed in the name of 'yatri'
 vastutah kuch mitron ke aagrah par 1941 isvi ke baad unhone hindi main nagarjun ke alaava kisi naam se na likhane kaa nirnay liya tha
 Nagarjuna's first published work was a Maithili poem which appeared in a magazine called 'mithila' published in 1929 from Laheriasarai, Darbhanga

 Apart from Maithili and Sanskrit, he was also associated with Bala
 bangla bhashaa or sahitya se nagarjun kaa lagaav shuru se hi rahaa
 While living in Kashi, he started reading Bengali literature in his native life

 iske atirikt unhone vidyapati kii 'purush-pariksha' kii teraa kahaniyon kaa bhi bhavanuaad kiya tha jo 'vidyapati kii kahaniyaan' naam se 1964 i0 main prakashit hui thi
 Floating in the sky -1982 main military kaa boodha ghoda -1997 In the poetry of Nagarjuna, only the entire Indian poetry tradition can be seen to be present in vibrant form
 unka kavi-vyaktitv kalidas or vidyapati jaise kai kaaljayi kaviyon ke rachana-sansar ke gahan avagaahan, buddha evam marxvad jaise bahujanonmukh darshan ke vyaavhaarik anugaman tathaa sabase badhkar apane samay or parivesh kii samasyaon, chintaaon evam sangharshon se pratyaksh judawattha loksamskruti evam lokahruday kii gahari pahchaan se nirmit he
 His 'traveler' has been a means of understanding the Indian psyche and content in a holistic and true way
 maithili, hindi or sanskrit ke alaava pali, praakrit, bangla, sinhalai, tibeti aadi anekanek bhashaaon kaa gyaan bhi unke liye isi uddeshy main sahaayak rahaa he

 jan sangharsh main adig aasthaa, janata se gaharaa lagaav or ek nyaaypurna samaaj kaa sapana, ye teen gun nagarjun ke vyaktitv main hi nahin, unke sahitya main bhi ghule-mili hai
 Nagarjuna is the only poet after Nirala who has used so many verses, so many styles, so many styles and so many poetic forms
 paaramparik kavy roopon ko nae kathy ke saath istemaal karne or nae kavy kaushalon ko sambhav karanevaale ve adwitiya kavi hai
 It can be valuable for us to peep into some of his poetic crafts
 unki abhivyakti kaa dhang tiryak bhi he, behad theth or sidhaa bhi
 Unmatched in their obliqueness, they are as unique in their eloquence
 kavy roopon ko istemaal karne main unamem kisi prakaar kii koi antarbaadha nahin he
 a major genre in his poetry is the style of free dialogue in the subject
 nagarjun kii hi kavita se pad udhaar len to kah sakate hai-swaagat shok main beej nihit hai vishwa vyathaa ke
 Baba has tremendous authority over language
 desi boli ke theth shabdon se lekar sanskritnishtha shastreey padaavalee tak unki bhashaa ke anekon str hai
 Apart from Hindi, he has written a lot separately in Maithili, Bangla and Sanskrit
 jaisaa pehle bhav-bodh ke sandarbh main kaha gaya, vaise hi bhashaa kii drushti se bhi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki baba kii kavitaaon main kabir se lekar dhoomil tak kii puri hindi kavy-parampara ek saath jeevant he
 Baba did not even avoid the verses, but showed them by using them in his poems in a revolutionary way
 baba kii kavitaaon kii lokapriyata kaa ek aadhaar unke dwaara kiya gaya chhandon kaa sadha hua chamatkaarik prayog bhi he
 According to contemporary prominent Hindi litterateur Uday Prakash "it needs to be emphasized that Baba Nagarjuna was not only the 'bhades' of the twentieth century Hindi poetry and the poet of the rebellious mood, he was the most unique original intellectual poet of the Hindi caste
 ve sirf 'aggit poet' nahin, paaramparik bhartiya kavy parampara ke viral 'abhijaat' or 'elite poet' bhi the
 "uday Prakash has written in the same Mahavakya alluding to the great importance of personality-building and gratitude of Baba Nagarjuna, that" consider yourself, the poet who has studied Buddhist philosophy and Marxism deeply, Rahul Sankrityayan and May have been a companion of such great medals as Anand Kausalayan, who learned the wisdom of ancient Indian thought tradition in languages like Pali, Prakrit, Apabhramsa and Sanskrit Having attained harat, the poet who has acquired almost the same eloquence in Hindi, Maithili, Bangla and Sanskrit, in his original wisdom and cognition which is close to the great saint tradition of Tulsi and Kabir, the creator who wrote 'balachanama' And through novels like 'son of Varun', the foundation of regional novel writing in Hindi has been laid, due to which Hindi fiction literature has gained historical talent like Renu
