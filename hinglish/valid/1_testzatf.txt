 newton ke gati niyam teen bhautik niyam hai jo chirsmmat yantriki ke aadhaar hai
 These rules describe the relationship between the force exerted on an object and the speed of that object
 inhen teen sadiyon main anek prakaar se vyakt kiya gaya he
 Newton's three laws of motion, traditionally, are summarized as follows: sabase pehle newton ne inhe apane granth philasphi nechuralis principia mathematica main sankalit kiya tha
 Newton used them to explain the problems related to the motion of physical objects in many places
 apane granth ke tritiy bhaag main newton ne darshaya ki gati ke ye teenon niyam or unke saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa niyam sammilit rup se kepler ke akashiya pindon kii gati se sambandhit niyam kii vyakhya karne main samarth hai
 Newton's law of motion is applied only to those objects which we can consider as a particle
 matlab ki un vastuon kii gati ko napate samay unke aakar ko nazarandaz kiya jaataa he
 These rules are applied by considering the objects of those objects centered in a single point
 aisa tab kiya jaataa he jab vishleshan main dooriyaan vastuyon kii tulana main kaaphi bade hote he
 Therefore, the planets can be measured as a particle and their orbital speed can be measured
 apane mul rup main in gati ke niyamo ko drudh or virupanshil pindon par nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 1750, Leonard Euler expanded Newton's speed rules and created Euler's speed rules that could also be applied to rigid and deformable bodies
 yadi ek vastu ko asatat kanon kaa ek sangyojan mana jaye, jiname alag-alag kar ke newton ke gati niyam lagaaye ja sakate he, to ular ke gati niyam ko newton ke gati niyam se viyuttpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Newton's laws of motion also apply in some direction systems, called inertial direction systems
 kai lekhako kaa maananaa he ki pratham niyam jadtviya nirdesh tantra ko paribhaashit karata he or dwitiya niyam sirf unhi nirdesh tantron se main maanya he isi kaaran se pehle niyam ko dusre niyam kaa ek vishesh rup nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 But some consider the first rule to be the result of the second
 nirdesh tantron kii spasht avadharana newton ke marane ke kaaphi samay pashchaat viksit hui
 Newtonian mechanics has now been replaced by Einstein's theory of special relativity, but it is still used for objects at a speed less than the speed of light
 newton ke mul shabdon main Hindi translation "prayek vastu apane sthiravastha athwa ekasmaan vegavastha me tab tak rahati he jab tak use kisi bahya kaarak dwaara avasthaa main badlaav ke liye prerit nahin kiya jaataa
 " duusare shabdon main, jo vastu viraam avasthaa main he vah viraam avasthaa main hi rahegi tathaa jo vastu gatiman hai vah gatiman hi rahegi jab tak ki us par bhi koi bahari bal naa lagaaya jaae
 Newton's first law defines inertia, a natural property of matter that opposes changes in momentum
 isliye pratham niyam ko jadtv kaa niyam bhi kehete he
 This rule also indirectly defines the inertial reference system and force
 iske kaaran newton dwaara is niyam ko pratham rakhaa gaya
 Simple authentication of this rule is difficult because the bodies feel the effects of friction and gravity
 asal main newton se pehle galileo ne is prekshan kaa varnan kiya
 Newton expressed it in other words
 newton ke mul shabdo main : Translation in hindi " kisi vastu ke samveg me aayaa badlaav us vastu par aropit dhakke ke samaanupati hota he tathaa samaan disha main ghatit hota he
 "the following points can be arranged by Newton's law: jahaan f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} bal, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} samveg or t { \ displaystyle t} samay hai
 According to this equation, when there is no external force on a body, the momentum of the body remains constant
 jab pind kaa dravyaman sthir hota he, to sameekaran zyaada saral rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: Where m { \ displaystyle m} is mass and a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} is acceleration
 yani kisi pind kaa twaran aropit bal ke anukramanupati he
 The impulse relates to the Second Rule
 aaveg kaa matlab he samveg main parivartan
 meaning: jahaan i aaveg he
 Very important in the analysis of impulse collisions
 mana ki kisi pind kaa dravyaman m he
 Applying a rule force f to this for ान्तt time period, the velocity changes to ∆v
 tab newton- Therefore, the impulse given to a body is similar to the change in momentum produced in the body
 at: aaveg kaa maatrak vahi hota he jo samveg kaa he
 The third law means that there is another force corresponding to a force that is equal and opposite to it
 newton ne is niyam ko istemaal karke samveg sangrakshan ke niyam kaa varnan kiya, lekin asal main samveg sangrakshan ek adhik moolbhoot siddhant he
 There are many examples in which momentum is preserved but the third rule is not valid
 pita kii bahan ko bua kaha jaataa he

 hindu sanskaron kaa isamen mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 The Rigveda does not mention the rites, but in some verses of this book some religious acts related to marriage, conception and funerals are found
 yajurveda main keval shrout yagyon kaa ullekh he, isliye is granth ke sanskaron kii vishesh jaankaree nahin milti
 In the Atharvaveda, more elaborate descriptions of marriage, funerals and conception rites are found
 gopath or shatapath brahmanon main upanayan godaan sanskaron ke dharmik krityon kaa ullekh miltaa he
 At the end of education in the Taittiriya Upanishad, the convocation of Acharya is found
 is prakaar grihyasutron se purv hamen sanskaron ke puure niyam nahin milte
 It seems that rites were performed on the basis of traditional practices before Grihasuutras
 sabase pehle grihasutron main hi sanskaron kii puri paddati kaa varnan miltaa he
 In the description of the rites in the Grihyasutras, marriage rites are first mentioned
 iske baad garbhaadhan, punswan, simantonnayan, jaat- karm, namakaran, nishkraman, ann- prashan, chuda- karm, upanayan or samaavartan sanskaron kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The description of funeral rites is not found in most householders, as it was considered inauspicious to do so
 smritiyon ke aachaar prakarnon main sanskaron kaa ullekh he or tatsambandhi niyam die gaye hai
 These describe in detail the Upanayana and marriage rites, as the person entered the Brahmacharya ashram through the Upanayana rites and the Grihastha ashram through the marriage rites
 sanskaar kaa abhipraay un dharmik krityon se tha jo kisi vyakti ko apane samudaay kaa purna rup se yogya sadsy banane ke uddeshy se uske sharir, man or mastishk ko pavitra karne ke liye kiye jate the, kintu hindu sanskaron kaa uddeshy vyakti main abhisht gunon ko janm dena bhi tha
 The use of the word "sanskar" is not found in Vedic literature
 sanskaron kaa vivechan mukhya rup se grihyasutron main hi miltaa he, kintu inamen bhi sanskaar shabd kaa prayog yajna saamagree ke pavitrikaran ke arth main kiya gaya he
 The Vaikhanas Smriti Sutra is the first to find a clear distinction between bodily rites and yajnas
 manu or yajyavlky ke anusaar sanskaron se dwijon ke garbh or beej ke doshaadi kii shuddhi hoti he
 Kumaril reveals some different views of it in the Tantravartik treatise
 unke anusaar manushya do prakaar se yogya banataa he - purv- karm ke dosha ko dur karne se or nae gunon ke utpaadan se
 Both of these rituals work
 is prakaar pracheen bharat main sanskaron kaa manushya ke jivan main vishesh mahatv tha
 Through the rites, man developed his natural instincts and took welfare of both himself and the society
 ye sanskaar is jivan main hi manushya ko pavitra nahin karte the, uske parloukik jivan ko bhi pavitra banaate the
 Home was performed before each rite, but according to the Griसूasutra which the person followed, the number of sacrifices, the use of hymns and mantras differed among different families
 gautam dharmasutra main sanskaron kii sankhya chalis likhi he
 Following are these forty rites: - 1
 garbhaadhan,2
 punswan,3
 simantonnayan,4
 jatakarm,5
 namakaran,6
 ann prashan,7 chaul,8
 upanayan, 9-12
 vedon ke chaar vrath, 13
 snaan, 14
 vivaah, 15-19 panch dainik mahayajna, 20-26 saat pakyagya, 27-33 saat haviryagy, 34-40 saat somayajna
 But most theology has not mentioned the four Vratas of the Vedas, the Pancha Dainik Mahayagya, the seven Pakyagyas, the seven Haviryagyas and the seven Somayagyas in the rites
 manu ne garbhaadhan, punswan, simantonnayan, jatakarm, namakaran, nishkraman, annaprashan, chudakarm, upanayan, keshant, samaavartan, vivaah or shmashaan, in teraa sanskaron kaa ullekh kiya he
 Yajnavalkya has also described these rites
 keval keshant kaa varnan usamen nahin miltaa he, kyonki is kaal tak vaidic granthon ke adhyayan kaa prachlan band ho gaya tha
 Later rituals give sixteen the number of sacraments, but the Gautam Dharmasutra and the Grihyasutras do not mention the funeral rites, as it was considered inauspicious to describe the funeral rites
 swami dayanand saraswati ne apni sanskaar vidhi tathaa pandit bhimsen sharma ne apni shodash sanskaar vidhi main solah sanskaron kaa hi varnan kiya he
 Both these authors have included funerals in sixteen rites
 garbhavastha main garbhaadhan, punswan or simantonnayan teen sanskaar hote hai
 The purpose of these three is to make the life-style of the parents such that the child is born with good values
 jaat- karm, namakaran, nishkraman, annaprashan, mundan, karn bedh, ye chah sanskaar paanch varsh kii aayu main samaapt ho jate hai
 Human habits are formed during childhood itself, so these rites are kept very early
 upanayan or vedarambh sanskaar brahmacharyashram ke prarambh main praayah saath- saath hote the
 Samvartanas and marriage ceremonies are preceded by homeland labor
 unhen bhi saath- saath samajhnaa chahie
 Vanaprastha and Sannyas Samskara are the roles of both these ashrams

 Its purpose is to burn the dead man's body with fragrant substances and spread it in the air, so that the odor etc

 While working as an instrument manufacturer at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines
 He felt that the cylinder of contemporary engines wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and then heating that cylinder
 Watt introduced a design enhancement, separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and improved the fundamental power, efficiency and cost effectiveness of the steam engine
 He developed the concept of horsepower
 Watt, the unit of SI power, was named after him

 Modernism, in its broadest definition, is modern thinking, character, or practice
 More specifically, the term originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, largely from the wide-ranging and remote cultural trends in Western society
 Describes both a group of people and an array of associated cultural movements

 Modernism rejected the latent certainty of enlightenment thinking, and the existence of a compassionate, all-powerful Creator
 This does not mean that all modernist people or modernist movements have refused to accept either religion or aspects of Enlightenment thinking, rather that modernism is seen as an interrogation of the "axioms" of the past can go

 Elliot wrote: saahitiyik vidwaan peter childs jatilta kaa saar prastut karte hai: This resistance is rooted in modernism: it differs from the modern era in its broad cultural understanding of the assessment of the past, the belief that the world was becoming more complex and that the old "last authority" was excessive Were subject to significant scrutiny

 From this perspective, modernism encouraged a re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the aim of finding out what was hindering progress and replacing it with new methods to reach that goal

 In the midst of this synthesis were common beliefs and institutional creations of reference, including the theological vision found in Christianity, the scientific vision found in traditional physics, and some theories that emphasized that an objective norm Depiction of external reality was not only possible but also desirable

 In philosophy, intellectual, materialistic and positivist movements established a primacy of reason and system

 Among these, agricultural and religious revivalist movements in plastic arts and poetry were notable
 buddhivaad ne bhi darshan main tarkwaadi-virodhiyon kii pratikriya ko aakarshith kiya
 In particular, Hegel's dialectical approach to civilization and history attracted the reactions of Friedrich Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard, who were the main inspirations of existentialism

 From the 1870s onwards, there was a progressive attack on the idea that history and potential were naturally progressive and that progress was always good

 There was a debate that the values of artist and society were not only different, but society was also antithetical to progress and it could not proceed in its present form

 Two of the most important thinkers of the period were Charles Darwin in biology and Karl Marx in political science

 karl marks kaa tark tha ki poonjivadi vyavastha ke bheetar kuch moulik virodhabhas the or yah bhi ki shramik kuch bhi magar aaazaad the
 Both thinkers gave birth to defenders and ideological groups who became decisive in the establishment of modernism
 itihaaskaaron ne aadhuniktawaad ke shuruuaati ankon ke rup main vibhinn tarikhon kaa suzav diya he
 William Everdale has argued that modernism began with the division of Richard Dedekind's real number line in 1872 and Boltzmann's statistical thermodynamics in 1874
 Clement Greenberg called e Manuel Kant "the first real modernist", but also wrote, "the emergence of what can safely be called modernism, relatively locally, in France, Baudelaar in literature and Manet in painting and prose imagery Probably occurred with Flaubert in the middle of the last century
 
" shuru main, aadhuniktawaad ko "kala-agrani" kaha jaataa tha or yah shabd aisi gatividhiyon kaa varnan karata rahaa jo apane aapako parampara yaa yathasthiti ke kuch pahaluon ko ukhaad phenkane kaa prayaas karne vaale ke rup main pahchaan karti hai
 Separately, in art and letters, the two ideas originating in France had a special effect
 The first of these was Impressionism, a painting group that initially looked at work done outside, not in the studio
 prabhaavvaadi chitra pradarshan karte the ki maanav jati vastuon ko nahin dekhati he, balki isaki jagah iske swayan ke prakaash ko dekhati he
 The group gathered followers despite internal divisions among its leading physicians and became increasingly influential

 1863 kaa ek mahatvapurn salon - salon des rifuzez tha jiskaa nirmaan shaasha nepolian tritiy ne paris salon dwaara asweekrut sabhi chitrakalaon kaa pradarshan karne ke liye kiya tha
 While most of those paintings were produced in standard styles, the work of the minor artists, the creation of the manet, gained tremendous appeal and opened commercial doors for the movement
 doosraa skool pratikwaad tha, jo ek vishwaas dwaara chihnit tha ki bhashaa spasht rup se apni prakruti or deshbhakti ke ek chithran main pratikatmak hota he or yah bhi ki kavita or lekhan ko sanyojanon kaa anusaran karnaa chahie jo shabdon kii pravan dhwani evam sanrachana se nirmit hota he
 The poet Stephen Malarmi was given special importance to him which occurred later

 The sufferings and possibilities of industrial urbanism arising from the scientific examination of subjects led to many changes that shook European civilization, which up to that time considered itself the fountain of the continuous and progressive line of development from the Renaissance

 Many modern scriptures refer to their pre-twentieth century forms as "classical"
 yah antar un parivartanon ke kshetra ko darshata he jo is avadhi ke dauraan bade paimaane par hone vaali vaigyanik evam saanskrithik gatividhiyon ke saath hua tha
 In the 1890s, a war of thinking began to emphasize that instead of merely reiterating knowledge of the past in light of current techniques, past norms needed to be completely removed
 kala ke kshetra main apana sir uthaane vaala aandolan bhautikee main saapekshata kaa siddhant; aatanrik dahan ingine evam audyogikaran kaa badhata ekikaran; or saarvajanik niti main saamaajik vigyaan kii vardhit bhoomika jaise vikaason ke saath-saath chalata rahaa

 The theories of Sigmund Freud and Ernst Mäck were powerful inspirations in this wave of modernism, who argued in the early 1880s that the brain had a fundamental structure and that subjective experience was based on the interaction of parts of the brain 
 frid ke vichaaron ke anusaar sabhi vyaktiparak vaastaviktaa mul prerana or sahaj gyaan kii bhoomika par aadhaarit thi jiske jariye bahari duniya kii kalpana kii gai thi
 Ernst Maek developed a well-known philosophy in science often called "positivism", according to which there was no guarantee of the relationship of objects in nature but only through a kind of mental shorthand
 isane ateet se ek algaav kaa pratinidhitiv kiya, jisamen pehle yahi mana jaataa tha ki bahari evam nirpeksh vaastaviktaa apane aap, jaisi yah thi, ek vyakti par par prabhaav daal sakati thi, jaise ki, udhaaharan ke taur par, jon loke kaa anubhavvaad, ek achoote yuva mastishk ke rup main shuruyaat karne vaale mastishk ke saath hota tha
 Freud's description of subjective conditions, including a stun brain filled with counterbalanced self-imposed restrictions and initial impulses, was combined by Carl Jung with a belief in the natural essence to contract a collective unconscious that is the original substance
 The study was replete with conscious minds fighting or hugging
 darwin kii rachana ne logon ke man main "maanav, pashu" kii avadharana ko prastut kiya tha or jang ke drushtikon ne suzav diya ki saamaajik mandandon kaa ulanghan karne ke prati logon ke aaveg bachapanaa yaa agyanta kaa fal nahin tha, balki maanav pashu ke aavashyak se vyutpann tha
 Friedrich Nietzsche was biased towards a philosophy in which force, particularly the 'desire to provide power', was more important than facts and things
 isi tarah, henry bergesan kii rachanaaen vaastaviktaa kii sthitik avadharanaon par mahatvapurn 'jivan bal' kii pakshpaati thi
 All these authors united through a romantic mistrust of Victorian positivism and certainty
 Instead he favored it, or, in Freud's case, attempted to explain the processes of irrational thinking in terms of rationality or perfection
 yah paripurna shabdon main soch ke prati sadiyon se chali aa rahi pravriti se judaa hua tha, jisamen tantra-mantra main ek vardhit ruchi or "pranashakti" shaamil thi
 This collision of ideas derived from Romanticism and an attempt to find a way to explain a hitherto unknown fact led to the arrival of the first wave of compositions, which, while the authors of these compositions expounded the current trends in art, It was believed that the artist broke the contract with the general public that the artists were lecturers and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas

 This wave of modern activity severed its connection to the past in the first decade of the twentieth century and attempted to redefine various forms in a revolutionary way
 is aandolan ke saahitiyik khand ke bheetar agrani prakaashon main shaamil hai: Musicians such as Schoenberg, Stravinsky and George Antheil represent modernism in music

 Artistic modernism influenced celebrities outside of this activity; John Maynard Keynes, for example, was a friend of Woolf and other writers of the Bloomsbury group

 In 1907, Picasso was painting his Demoiselles d'avignon, Oskar Kokoshka was writing his mortar, Höfnung der Frauen, the first expressionist play, and Arnold Schoenberg composed the music of his string quartet # 2 in f-sharp Minor , Which was his first "music center-less" composition
 1911 main, candinsky ne bild mit creis kii chitrakaari kii jise unhone baad main pratham amoort chitrakala kaha

 These activities gave him a new meaning, dubbed 'modernism': it embraced discontinuity and unacceptable uninterrupted change in everything from biology to fictional character development and filmmaking
 It allowed for the disintegration, rejection or exclusion of simple realism in literature and art, and the rejection of ragini in music or the dramatic alteration of it
 This set modernists apart from 19th-century artists, who tended to believe not only in smooth change, but also in the progressiveness of such change — 'progress'
 dicans or tolstoy jaise lekhak, turnar jaise chitrakaar or brahams jaise sangeetkaar 'kattarpanthi' yaa 'bohemian' nahin the, balki samaaj ke moolyawaan sadsy the jinhone kala kaa nirmaan kiya jise samaaj main, yahaan tak ki kabhi-kabhi iske kam vaanchhneeya pahaluon kii pratyaalochana karte samay bhi, shaamil kiya gaya
 Modernism, while still "progressive," saw progressively restricting traditional forms and traditional social systems as progress, and therefore reintroduced the artist as a deposed, revolutionary rather than enlightened
 bhavishyavaad is pravriti kii misaal detaa he
 In 1909, the Paris newspaper Le Figaro created F
 Published the first manifesto of T
 Marinetti
 iske turant baad chitrakaaron ke ek samooh ne bhavishyavaadee ghoshnaptr par sah-hastakshar kiya
 Such manifestos, modeled on the famous "communist manifesto" model of the last century, presented ideas that were meant to excite and mobilize followers

 Modernist philosophy and art were still seen as only part of a larger social activity

 Controversial facts in favor of anatomical or purely abstract painting were mostly confined to "small magazines" with small collections

 However, the Great War and the subsequent accidents were a cataclysmic uplift that concerned artists such as the Brahms of the late 19th century and was embraced by art-pioneers
 sabase pehle, pichhali yathapurv sthiti kii vifaltaa ek peedi ke liye swa-sakshya prathit hua jisane lakhon logon ko dharti ke tukdon ke liye ladate-marate dekha tha—yuddh se pehle, tark diya gaya tha ki koi aisa yuddh nahin ladega, kyonki isaki laagat bahut zyada thi
 Second, the advent of the machine age changed the conditions of life — machine war became a test of ultimate reality

 Also, mankind was making slow and continuous moral progress, this approach seemed ridiculous in the face of meaningless killing
 The First World War has forgotten the rigid mechanical radical understanding of technology with the terrible irrationality of myth
 is prakaar aadhuniktaa, jo yuddh se pehle ek alpsankhyak ruchi thi, 1920 ke dashak ko paribhaashit karne laga

 Each of these "modernism," as some observers labeled it at the time, emphasized new ways to produce new results
 Then, Impressionism became a precursor that severed ties to the idea of national schools which artists and writers adopted as ideas of international movements
 atiyatharthwaad, ghanavaad, bauhaus or leninavaad sabhi un aandolanon ke udhaaharan hai jisane badi teji se ise apnaane waalon ko unki bhugolic mul se koson dur unhen sthapit karte hai
 The exhibition, theater, cinema, book and building all served to reinforce people's perception of the notion that times were changing

 By 1930, modernism had achieved a place in other establishments, including political and artistic establishments, although by this time modernism itself had changed

 Modernism consisted of attempts to fight its universal principles and a series of sometimes contradictory reactions to a similar perceived situation

 From these two seemingly incompatible pillars, modernists engaged in the task of designing a complete life philosophy that had the potential to embody every aspect of life
 1930 tak, aadhuniktawaad ne lokapriy samskruti main pravesh kar liya tha
 With the increasing urbanization of the population, it was seen as a source to deal with the challenges of the day
 When modernism was attracted towards the academic community, it was developing a conscious theory of its own importance
 lokapriy samskruti, jo ucch samskruti se nahin balki apane swayan kii vaastaviktaaon se vyutpann hua tha, ne aadhuniktaavaadi navachaar ko kaaphi prerit kiya

 Younger writers and comedians like Perelman and James Thurber began publishing new and modern ideas
 Modern ideas in art appeared in advertisements and logos, the most famous of which was the London Underground logo designed by Edward Johnston in 1919, an early example of the need for clear, easily recognizable and memorable visual symbols

 In Britain and America, modernism as a literary movement is generally considered to be relevant until the early 1930s, and the term "modernist" is rarely used, especially for writers after 1945

 Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinvention of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century through cubism and built sculpture, Polak redefined the way art was created
 chitrafalak chitrakala or abhismay se dur unka sthanantaran unke yug ke kalakaaron or unke baad aane vaale sabhi kalakaaron ke liye ek mukti sanket tha
 Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process — placing a compressed raw canvas on the floor where it could be invaded from all sides using artistic and industrial materials; By dripping and throwing a linear color group; By painting, painting and brushing; By using imagination and non-imagination — it inevitably gave rise to artistry beyond any prior boundary
 Abstract expressionism broadened and developed the definitions and possibilities commonly available to artists for the creation of new artworks
 anya amoort abhivyanjanavadiyon ne apane khud kii naveen safaltaaon ke saath polak kii safalataa kaa anusaran kiya
 In a way, the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyford Still, Barnett Newman, Ed Reinhardt, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkus, and others have all diversified the art
 And opened the entire gates of the area
 However, the reprint of abstract art by art historians such as Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock, and Catherine de Zegher suggests that leading female artists who introduced major innovations in modern art were ignored by the official details of its history Was

 However, by the late 1960s, postmodernism, process art and Arte Povera also appeared through the lyrical abstractions and postmodernist movements and in early conceptual art, as revolutionary concepts and movements that included both early painting and sculpture

 The movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on interpretive and psychological intimacy in favor of art consumerism, advertising and iconography showcasing the material consumer culture of the prolific production era
 The early acts of David Hockney and the works of Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi were considered fundamental examples of this movement

 1960 ke dashak ke armbh tak kala main ek amoort aandolan ke rup main atisookshmavaad kaa udbhav hua jisane sambandhparak or vyaktiparak chitrakala, amoort abhivyanjanavadi satahon kii jatilta or ection painting ke kshetra main maujuud vivaadaatmak kushalta evam bhaavnaatmak yugachetana ke vichaar ko tyaag diya
 atisookshmavaad ne tark diya ki atyadhik saadagi kala main aavashyak sabhi vishisht pradarshan par kabza kar sakati thi
 The minimalism in the field of painting is a modernist movement, unlike other fields, receiving the support of painters like Frank Stella
 atisookshmavaad ko naanaa prakaar se yaa to uttaradhuniktawaad kaa ek agradoot, yaa khud ek uttaradhunik aandolan samajha jaataa he
 In the latter approach, early minimalism led to advanced modernist acts, but this movement partially abandoned this direction when some artists, such as Robert Morris, changed direction in favor of the anti-construction movement
 hill foster apane da crooks of minimlism naamak niabandh main us had tak jaanch karte hai jis had tak donald jud or robert morris donon atisookshmavaad ke apane prakashit paribhaashaon main greenbergavaadi aadhuniktawaad ko sweekaar or uskaa vistaar karte hai
 He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of modernism, but "a paradigm shift of postmodern practices that still extend today"
 1960 ke dashak ke antim daur main robert pinkos-vitten ne atisookshmavaadi-vyutpann kala kaa varnan karne ke liye uttantisookshmavaad shabd kii rachana kii jisamen ve saamagree or praasangik maksadon nihit the jinhen atisookshmavaad ne tyaag diya tha
 pincus-whiten used the term for the works of Eva Hayes, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra, and former minimalists such as Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, and Sol Levitt, and new works by Barry Leva, and other celebrities
 donald jud, dan flayvin, karl andre, agnes martin, jon mccracen or anya sahit anya atisookshmavaadi apane kariyar kii shesh avadhi tak antim daur kii aadhuniktaavaadi chitrakala or murtikla kaa nirmaan karte rahe
 In the 1960s, the works of art-leading minimalist composers such as La Monte Young, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley also gained prominence in the New York art world
 uske baad se, kai kalakaaron ne atisookshmavaadi or uttantisookshmavaadi shaileyon ko apanaaya he or un par "uttaradhunik" hone kaa label lag gaya he
 The emergence of a combination of objects created with artist materials, moving away from previous traditions of painting and sculpture, was related to abstract expressionism
 robert roshanberg kii kriti is pravriti kii ek misaal he
 His "batches" of the 1950s were pioneers of pop art and installation art and used a collection of large material objects, including stuffed animals, birds, and commercial photographs
 roshanberg, jasper johns, laire reverse, jon chemberlen, cless oldenberg, jorge segal, gym dine or edward kinholz kii ginati amoort or pop donon tarah kii kalaon ke pramukh agraduton main kii jaati thi
 By creating a new tradition of art-making, he made serious contemporary art cycles acceptable for radical insertion into his works of improbable materials
 Another precursor to aggregated painting was Joseph Cornell, whose well-known amplified acts were seen as radical because of both the use of his objects and personal iconography
 20veen sadi ke armbh main marcel ducamp ne ek mutralay ko ek murtikla ke rup main pradarshit kiya
 He expressed his intention that people see the urinal as if it was an artwork because they said it was an artwork
 vah apane krity ko "radimeads" krity ke rup main sandarbhit karte the
 The Fountain was a urinal on which the pseudonym R
 Mat had a signature, whose exhibition in 1917 surprised the art world
 It and Duchamp's other acts are generally labeled Dada
 ducamp ko vaicharik kala ke ek agradoot ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, anya prasiddh udaahranon main jon kej kaa 4'33" or roshanberg kaa irezd de kooning kaa pramukh sthaan he, 4'33" chaar minute taintis second kii chuppi he
 Many thoughtful actions assume the position that art is the result of an object's viewer or work as an art, not the intrinsic quality of the act itself
 In this way, as the fountain was exhibited, it was a sculpture
 marcel ducamp ne prasiddhipurvak shatranj ke paksh main "kala" kaa parityag kar diya
 kala-agrani sangeetkaar david tuder ne reunion naamak ek lekh kii rachana kii jise unhone lowell cross ke saath milakar likhaa tha, jo ek aise shatranj ke khel ko darshata he jisamen prayek chaal ek prakashwan prabhaav yaa prakshepan ko shuru karata he
 Duchamp and Cage played the game at the premiere of the act
 steven best or duglas kelnar roshanberg evam jasper johns kii pahchaan aadhuniktawaad evam uttaradhuniktawaad ke darmyaan, marcel ducamp dwaara prerit, sankramanakalin charan ke hisse ke rup main karte hai
 Both used images of ordinary objects or objects themselves in their creations while maintaining the essence of high modernism and the spirit of the painter
 nav-dada se jude kala main ek or pravriti ek saath asankhya vibhinn madhyam kaa istemaal he
 Intermediately, the term was invented by Dick Higgins to convey new forms along the lines of fluxus, tangible poetry, received objects, performance art, and computer art
 higgins samathing alls press ke prakaashak, ek moort kavi, kalakaar ellison noles ke pati or marcel ducamp ke ek prashansak the
 In the late 1950s and 1960s, interested artists began to push the boundaries of contemporary art
 Yves Klein in France and Carolee Schneeman in New York City, Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman, and Yoko Ono were pioneers of performance-based artifacts
 julian bek evam judith malina ke saath da living theatre jaise samoohon ne murtikaron or chitrakaaron ke saath milakar vaataavaran taiyaar karne main sahyog kiya or moulik rup se khaas taur par apni rachana paradise nau main darshak or pradarshak ke bich ke sambandh ko badal diya

 Park Place Gallery was a center for musical performances by electronic composers such as Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and other notable performing artists including Joan Jonas
 in pradarshnon kaa iraadaa ek aise nae kala rup kii rachanaaon kaa pradarshan karnaa tha jisamen murtikla, nrity or sangeet yaa dhwani kaa samavesh ho jisamen aksar darshakon kii bhagidaari rahati thi
 They were characterized by the reductionist philosophies of minimalism and the spontaneous improvisation and expressiveness of abstract expressionism
 isi avadhi ke dauraan vibhinn kala-agrani kalakaaron ne tamaashon kaa nirmaan kiya
 The spectacles were mysterious and often spontaneous and unwritten conferences of artists and their friends and relatives in various designated locations, often involving incompatibility, materiality, costumes, spontaneous nudity, and various random or symbolic unrelated acts
 in tamaashon ke ullekhneey rachanakaaron main alan capro, cless oldenberg, gym dine, red grums or robert whitman shaamil the
 The performance art of Alan Capro attempted to integrate art and life
 tamaashon ke madhyam se jivan, kala or darshak ke bich kaa algaav dhundhala ho jaataa he
 These spectacles allow the artist to experiment with body movements, recorded sound, written and perceived text, and even odor
 alan capro ke sabase aarambhik tamaashon main se ek "hapanings in da neuyork seen" tha jisaki rachana 1961 main kii gai thi jis samay is kalaroop kaa vikaas ho rahaa tha
 In 1958, Capro published an essay entitled "the Legacy of Jackson Pollock"
 isamen vah "rang, kursi, bhojan, bijli or nian raushnee, dhumrapaan, jal, puraane mojey, kutta, film jaise rosemara kii samagriyon se nirmit ek "moort kala" kii maang karte hai
 In this particular lesson, he uses the word "tamasha" for the first time, saying that craftsmanship and durability should be forgotten and mortal materials should be used in art
 uttaradhunik shabd se judy kala kii ek or pravriti ekasaath asankhya media kaa upyog he
 Intermediately, the term was invented by Dick Higgins to convey new forms along the lines of fluxus, tangible poetry, received objects, performance art, and computer art
 higgins samathing alls press ke prakaashak, ek moort kavi, kalakaar ellison noles ke pati or marcel ducamp ke ek prashansak the
 Ihab Hasan includes "intermedia, fusion of forms, illusion of rights" in his list of features of postmodern art
 "multi-media kala" ke sabase aam tareekon main se ek video-tepe or siarti monitoron kaa upyog he, jise video kala kii sangya di gai he
 Although the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old and has been revived from time to time, postmodern expression is often associated with performance art, where the theatrical subtext is removed and all that remains
 It is an artist's dubious specific statement or conceptual statement of his works
 fluxs kaa namakaran or nirbaadh rup se iskaa aayojan lithuania main janme jorge maciunas naamak ek america kalakaar ne 1962 main kiya
 Fluxus began to receive nominations from John Cage's 1957 to 1959 experimental structure classes at New York City's New School for Social Research
 unke chaatro main se kai kalakaar the jo anya media main kaam karte the jinhen sangeet kii thodi bahut jaankaree yaa bilkul jaankaree nahin thi
 Cage's students included Fluxus founding members Jackson Mc Low, Al Hansen, George Brecht and Dick Higgins
 fluxs ne khud-se-karne ke soundarya siddhant ko protsaahit kiya evam jatilta par saadagi ko mahatv diya
 isse pehle dada kii tarah, fluxs main ek shaktishaalee vanijikaran-virdohi dhara or ek kala-virdohi samvedansheeltaa shaamil thi jo ek kalakaar-kendrit rachanaatmak pratha ke paksh main paaramparik bazaar-chaalit kala vishwa kii upeksha karata tha
 Fluxus artists preferred working with available materials and creating their own creations or collaborating with their partners in the construction process
 andriyaaz husain uttaradhuniktawaad ke liye fluxs kaa daawa "yaa to uttaradhuniktawaad ke master-code yaa antat apradarshneey kala aandolan - maano yah uttaradhuniktawaad kii uttam style ho" ke rup main karne ke prayaason kii aalochana karte hai
 Instead he sees Fluxus as a major neo-dadaist phenomenon within the art-pioneer tradition

 " kai vishyon ke kalakaar 21veen sadi main aadhuniktaavaadi shaileyon main kaam kar rahe hai
 The continuation of abstract expressionism, color field painting, lyrical abstractions, linear abstractions, minimalism, abstract illusionism, process art, pop art, post-minimalism and other modernist movements of late 20th century painting and sculpture persisted in the first decade of the 21st century and Radicals in those mediums set new directions
 21veen sadi ke mode par, sar anthony kaaro, lucian frid, sai twombli, robert roshanberg, jasper johns, agnes martin, al held, elsworth keli, hellen francntheller, frank stela, kenneth noland, julls olitsaki, cless oldenberg, gym dine, james rozencist, elex catz, philip parlstin jaise supratishthit kalakaaron or brice marden, chak chlose, sam gilium, ijak vitkin, shaun skali, joseph nechwatal, elizabeth mure, laire poons, richard serra, walter darbi banard, laire zoks, roni landfield, ronaald davis, dan christenson, joel shapiro, tom oternes, joan snidar, ross bleknar, archi rand, suzan kril jaise yuva kalakaaron ne mahatvapurn evam prabhaavshaalee chitrakalaon or murtiyon kaa nirmaan karnaa jari rakhaa
 However, by the early 1980s the postmodern movement in art and architecture began to consolidate its position through various conceptual and intermedia formats
 Postmodernism in music and literature, even earlier, according to some, by the 1950s, had begun to strengthen its grip
 jabaki uttaradhuniktawaad aadhuniktawaad ke ant ke baad se lagu hota he, kai siddhantvaadiyon or vidwaanon kaa tark he ki uttar aadhuniktawaad 21veen sadi main bhi kaayam he
 Many modernists believed that by abandoning tradition they could invent radically new ways of producing art
 arnold shoenberg ne paramparaagat tanvaale sadbhaav, sangeet kii rachanaaon kaa nirmaan karne kii padanukramit pranali ko tyaag diya jisane kam se kam dedh dashak tak sangeet nirmaan kaa pathpradarshan kiya tha
 He believed that he had invented an entirely new way of composing music based on the use of twelve-tone lines
 amoort kalakaaron, jo apane aapako prabhaavvaadi kehete hai, ke saath-saath paul sisen or edward manch ne is dharna ke saath shuruyaat kii ki rang evam akruti, na ki prakritik vishwa kaa chithran, ne kala kii aavashyak visheshtaon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Vasily Candinsky, Pete Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich all believed in redefining art as an arrangement of pure color
 photography ne aadhuniktawaad ke is pahalu ko bahut zyada prabhavit kiya, jisane drishy kala ke adhikansh pratinidhityawadee krityon ko gatkaalik bana diya tha
 However, these artists also believed that by abandoning the depiction of material objects, they had helped to move art from a materialistic stage of development to a spiritualist phase
 anya aadhuniktaavaadiyon, vishesh rup se jo dizine main antarbhukt the, ke vichaar adhik vyaavhaarik the
 Modernist architects and designers believed that new technology made old styles of buildings obsolete
 Le Corbizier's view was that buildings should function as "machines of residence", corresponding to cars, which they saw as machines of travel
 jis tarah kaaron ne ghodon kii jagah le lee thi, thik usee tarah aadhuniktaavaadi dizine ko pracheen misr yaa madhya yug se chali aa rahi puraani shaileyon or sanrachanaon ko tyaag dena chahie
 kuch maamalon main rup ne kaaryon kaa adhikraman kiya
 Following this machine aesthetic principle, modernist designers generally abandoned decorative motifs in design and preferred to emphasize materials used and pure linear forms
 neuyork main ludwig mies vine der rohe kii sigram building jaise gaganchumbi imaarat adyaprarupiy aadhuniktaavaadi imaarat ban gaye
 Modernist design of houses and furniture also generally emphasized simplicity and clarity of form, free-plan interior parts and lack of clutter
 Modernism reversed 19th-century public and private relations: In the 19th century, public buildings were spread horizontally for various technical reasons, and private buildings emphasized the perpendicular form to accommodate more private space on increasingly limited land

 Such practical considerations were less important in other arts

 This aspect of modernism often seems to be a reaction to consumer culture that developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century
 jabaki adhikansh nirmaataa un utpaadon kaa nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai jiskaa variyataon or pratikul prabhaavon ke aakarshan ke jariye vipanan kiya jayega, ucch aadhuniktaavaadiyon ne paaramparik soch ko kamjor banane ke liye is tarah ke upabhoktavaadi drushtikonon ko tyaag diya

 According to Greenberg, modernism established a backlash against the development of such examples of modern consumer culture as commercial popular music, Hollywood, and advertising
 Greenberg linked it to the revolutionary rejection of capitalism
 kuch aadhuniktaavaadiyon ne apane aapako ek krantikari samskruti ke hisse ke rup main dekha jisamen raajnneetik kranti shaamil thi
 Others abandoned traditional politics as well as artistic conventions, believing that a revolution of political consciousness was of much greater importance than a change of political structures

 The rejection of its tradition was and is the most controversial aspect of the modern movement
 aadimavad, kattarpanth, prayog or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par aadhuniktawaad kaa jor paaramparik ummiido kii upeksha karata he
 In many art forms, this often meant to surprise and alienate audiences with the use of excessive dissonance and unevenness in modernist music, or as strange and arbitrary effects of powerful and painful combinations of motifs in surrealism
 sahitya main isamen aksar upanyaason main spasht kathankon yaa charitrankan kaa tyaag, yaa spasht vyakhya kii upeksha karne vaale kavy kii rachana shaamil hoti thi
 After the rise of Stalin, the Soviet communist government abandoned modernism on the basis of perceived transcendentalism, although it had previously supported futurism and constructionism

 naziyon ne dijanret art sheershak vaali ek pradarshnee main maansik rup se biimaar kalakaaron kii rachanaaon ke saath-saath aadhuniktaavaadi chitrakalaon kaa bhi pradarshan kiya
 The accusation of "formalism" could have resulted in the end of one's career, or a worse condition

 However, after World War II, especially during the 1960s, high modernism began to merge with consumer culture
 In Britain, a young subculture emerged calling itself "modernist", following representative music groups such as The Who and The Kinks

 This merger of higher versions of modernist culture and the consumer resulted in a revolutionary change in the meaning of "modernism"
 sabase pehle, iskaa taatpary tha ki parampara ke tyaag par aadhaarit ek aandolan isaki apni ek parampara ban gai thi
 Second, it showed that the distinction between the classy modernist and the mass consumerist culture had lost its precision
 kuch lekhakon ne ghoshnaa kii ki aadhuniktawaad itnaa sansthagat ho gaya tha ki yah ab "uttar kala-agrani" ho gaya tha jo yah sanket detaa tha ki isane ek krantikari aandolan ke rup main apni shakti ko kho diya tha
 Many have interpreted this change as the beginning of a phase that came to be known as postmodernism
 kala sameekshak robert hughes jaise anya logon ke anusaar, uttaradhuniktawaad aadhuniktawaad ke ek vistaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 "anti-modern" or "anti-modern" movements seek to emphasize realism, composition and spirituality as a deterrence or counter to modernism
 aise aandolan aadhuniktawaad ko nunakaarak rup main dekhte hai or isliye pranaligat evam aakasmik prabhaavon ko dekhne kii aakshamata ke adheen he
 Many modernists adopt this view, as did Paul Hindemith in his final turn toward mysticism, for example
 The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World main paul ech

 iske bajaay, ve tark dete hai, vyaktigat rachanaatmakataa ko rosemara ke jivan ko bhaavnaatmak rup se adhik sweekaarya bananaa chahie
 The effects of modernism in some areas remain more powerful and more determined than others

 Most major capital cities have museums dedicated to 'modern art', different from post-renaissance art
 iske udaahranon main neuyork kaa musium of modern art, landan kaa tet modern or paris kaa centre pompido shaamil hai
 These galleries make no distinction between the modernist and postmodernist phases, seeing both as developmental developments within 'modern art'
 aadhuniktawaad saanskrithik andolanon kii ek vistrut vividhta kaa ek vyapak label he
 Postmodernism is essentially a centralized movement that derived its nomenclature on the basis of socio-political theory, although the term is used in its broadest sense to refer to activities from the 20th century onwards that demonstrate the awareness of the modern Do and reinterpret it
 uttaradhunik siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki aadhuniktawaad ko "tatheoparant" kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit karne kaa prayaas bemail virodhabhaason se abhishpt he
 In a superimposed sense, whatever was modernist was not necessarily postmodern either

 His family remained almost displaced for some time in the southern mountain regions of Mewar, later Kshemkarna established his new kingdom in 1437 AD by conquering the southern lands of Mewar, Devalia etc
 with the help of the sword
 kshemkarn ke putr maharana surajmal ne 1514 isvi main devgarh gram main apana sthai thikaana banaate hue 'nae rajya' kaa vistaar kiya

 sahasaa baithak main baithe rana ke doot par uski nigaah ja padi
 After the formalization, Thakur said to the messenger, "hey Shardul Tu"
 itani subah kaise? kya bhabhi ne ghar se khaded diya he? sara majaa phir kirkira kar diya
 The Sardar again said to the messenger, your new sister must have gone inside, angry at you
 nai nai he na
 Therefore the poor thing did not say anything
 aisi kya afat aa padi thi
 For two days, he used to allow peace
 miyaan bivi ke bich main kyon kebab main haddi banakar aa baithe
 Say good why has Rana missed me? He laughed hoarsely
 donon main gahari dosti thi
 If there were normal days, he would have responded in laughter too
 shardool khud bhi bada hansod tha
 He could not live a single moment without laughing at the joke, but he was very serious
 dost hansi chodo
 The moment of great crisis has come
 mujhe bhi turant waapas lautnaa he
 Suddenly he became silent after saying this
 apane is mitra ke vivaah main baaraati banakar gaya tha
 Seeing the lines of seriousness on his face, the mind of the Handa Sardar became apprehensive
 sachmuch kuch anhoni to nahin ho gayin he
 The messenger was hesitant whether to give Rana's letter to a friend at this time
 haada sardaar ko turant yuddh ke liye prasthaan karne kaa nirdesh lekar vah laayaa tha
 He remembered the friend's words
 haada ke pairon ke nakhunon main lage mahavar kii laali ke nishaan abhi bhi vaise ke vaise hi ubhare hue the
 Even the rosemary in the hands of the newly married handi queen will not be dry
 pati patni ne ek duusare ko thik se dekha pahachaanaa nahin hoga
 How painful will their separation be? He trembled as soon as he remembered this
 pataa nahin yuddh main kya ho? vaise to rajput mrityu ko khilonaa hi samajhataa hai
 Finally, after hardening, he put the letter of Rana Raj Singh in the hands of Hada Sardar
 rana kaa uske liye sandesh tha
 Veerwar
 avilamb apni sainya tukdi ko lekar aurangzeb kii sena ko roko
 The Muslim army is advancing its aid
 is samay aurangzeb ko main ghere hue hum
 His help is to keep the growing army entangled for some time so that it does not move soon, till then i finish the whole work
 tum is kaary ko badi kushalta se kar sakate ho
 Although it is very dangerous
 jaan kii baaji bhi lagaani pad sakati he
 i trust you
 haada sardaar ke liye yah pariksha kii ghadi thi
 On one hand, the vast Mughal army and its troops are very small
 rana rajsingh ne mewar ke chhine hue kshetron ko mughalon ke changul se mukt kara liya tha
 Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan had put the strength of his AD peak
 vah chup hokar baith gaya tha
 Now the reins of governance came in the hands of Aurangzeb
 rana se charumati ke vivaah ne uski dwesh bhaavana ko or bhi bhadkaa diya tha
 In the meantime, another thing had happened which brought Raj Singh and Aurangzeb face to face
 yah sampurna hindu jati kaa apmaan tha
 Accept Islam or punish you for being a Hindu
 yahi kah kar hinduon par usne jajia kar lagaaya tha
 Rana Raj Singh opposed it
 unka man bhi ise sahan nahin kar rahaa tha
 As a result, many other Hindu kings refused to implement it
 unka saahas bad gaya tha
 The fire that broke the chains of slavery, which had slowed down, was ignited again
 dakshin main shivaji, bundelkhand main chhatrasaal, punjab main guru govind singh, marwar main rathod vir durgadas mughal sultanate ke viruddh uth khadey hue the
 Even Mirza Raja Jai singh of Amer and Jaswant Singh of Marwar which were the two major pillars of the Mughal Sultanate
 unamem bhi swatantraaa premiyon ke prati sahanubhuti utpann ho gai thi
 The Mughal emperor attacked Mewar with a large army
 rana rajsingh ne sena ke teen bhaag kiye the
 The Mughal army had entrusted the responsibility of not allowing Aravali to enter its son Jaisingh
 ajmer kii ore se badshaah ko milane vaali sahaayta ko rokane kaa kaam duusare bete bhim singh kaa tha
 They, along with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore, broke out on Aurangzeb's army
 sabhi morchon par unhen vijay praapt hui thi
 Emperor Aurangzeb's great beloved Caucasian Begum was taken captive
 badi kathinaayee se kisi prakaar aurangzeb praan bachaakar nikal sakaa tha
 Such was the victory of Maharana of Mewar that Aurangzeb could never raise his head against him again in his lifetime
 lekin kya is vijay kaa shrey keval rana ko tha yaa kisi or ko? haada rani or haada sardaar ko kisi bhi prakaar se gam nahin tha
 When the Mughal emperor was surrounded by Rajputs all around
 uski jaan ke bhi laale pade the
 It was difficult for him to escape, when he called an additional army to help him from Delhi
 rana ko yah pehle hi gyaat ho chukaa tha
 He wrote a letter to Hada Sardar to block the passage of the Mughal army
 vahi sandesh lekar shardool singh mitra ke paas pahunchaa tha
 Not delaying even a single moment, Hada Sardar ordered his troops to march
 ab vah patni se antim vidaai lene ke liye uske paas pahunchaa tha
 Hadi Rani was shocked to see her husband dressed in saffron garb
 kahaan chale swami? itani jaldi
 Just now you were saying that the war has been spent for four to six months, what will it cut comfortably? Shocked in mixed words, the queen spoke to her husband
 priy
 The Kshatriyans wait for this day to test their husband's bravery and might
 vah shubh ghadi abhi hi aa gai
 We have got the opportunity to have two hands from the enemies of the country
 mujhe yahaan se avilamb nikalnaa he
 Say goodbye pataa nahin phir kabhi bhent ho yaa na ho haada sardaar ne muskaraa kar patni se kaha
 Hadra Sardar's mind was apprehensive
 sachmuch hi yadi na lautaa to
 What will happen to my half-heartedness? On one side was duty and on the other side was the attachment of wife
 isi antardvand main uskaa man fansaa tha
 He told the whole thing in detail regarding Rana Raj Singh's letter to his wife
 vidaai maangate samay pati kaa galaa bhar aayaa he yah hadi raji kii tej ankhon se chipa na rah sakaa
 Although the Harada chieftain tried to hide him completely
 hataash man vyakti ko vijay se dur le jaataa he
 It did not take long for that brave lady to understand that her husband was going to the battlefield but was enchanted
 pati vijayshri praapt karen iske liye usne kartavya kii vedi par apane moh kii bali de di
 She said to her husband, please be a lord
 main abhi ai
 She ran in and out
 aarti kaa thaal sajaayaa
 Inoculated her husband's head, performed her arti
 vah pati se boli
 i was blessed to find such a brave husband
 hamaara aapkaa to janm janmaantar kaa saath he
 Rajput Ramnis give birth to a son for this day only you go master
 main vijay maala liye dwaar par aapaki pratiksha karuungi
 He drank the tears rising in his eyes
 pati ko durbal nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 While walking, my husband said to her dear
 main tumko koi sukh na de sakaa, bas iskaa hi dukh he mujhe bhul to nahin jaaogi ? yadi main na rahaa to xxrep 13 
 Her sentences could not even be fulfilled that the Handi Rani placed a palm on her face
 na na swami
 Do not say such inauspicious things
 main vir rajputani hum, phir vir kii patni bhi hum
 Knowing your last religion very well, you definitely leave
 desh ke shatruon ke daant khattey karen
 This is my prayer
 haada sardaar ne ghode ko aid lagaayi
 The queen kept staring at him until he disappeared from his eyes
 uske man main durbalata kaa jo tufaan chipa tha jise abhi tak usne barabas roak rakhaa tha vah ankhon se bah niklaa
 The Harada Sardar was being blown up in the air with his army
 kintu uske man main rah rah kar aa rahaa tha ki kahi sachmuch meri patni mujhe bisar na den? vah man ko samajhaata par usak dhyaan udhar hi chalaa jaataa
 In the end, he could not stop it
 usne aadhe maarg se apane vishwast sainikon ke rani ke paas bheja
 He reminded me again, don't forget me
 main jarur lautoonga
 The queen returned after reassuring the communicator
 doosar din ek or vaahak aayaa
 Then the same thing
 tisare din phir ek aayaa
 This time he had brought the letter of Sardar to his wife
 priy main yahaan shatruon se loha le rahaa hum
 His feet have been stopped like Angad
 majaal he ki ve jaraa bhi aage bad jaaen
 This is the glory of your defense
 par tumhaare badi yaad aa rahi he
 The letter carrier must send someone their favorite sign
 use hi dekhakar main man ko halkaa kar liya karunga
 Hari Rani got into thinking after reading the letter
 yuddhrat pati kaa man yadi meri yaad main hi rama rahaa unke netron ke saamne yadi meraa hi mukhdaa ghumta rahaa to vah shatruon se kaise ladenge
 How will you describe Vijay Shri? a thought flashed in his mind
 vah sainik se boli vir ? main tumhen apni antim nishaan de rahi hum
 Take it and give it to them
 thaal main sajaakar sundar vastra se dhakkar apane vir senapati ke paas pahunchaa dena
 But no one else sees it
 ve hi khol kar dekhen
 Also give this letter of mine together
 hadi rani ke patr main likhaa tha priy
 i am sending you my last sign
 tumhaare moh ke sabhi bandhanon ko kaat rahi hum
 Now be careful and do your duty
 i left


 i will wait for you in heaven
 palak jhapakate hi hadi rani ne apane qamar se talwaar nikaal, ek jatke main apane sir ko uda diya
 He rolled on the earth
 sipaahi ke netro se ashrudhara bah nikali
 Duty of duty is harsh
 The soldier decorated the severed head of the handi queen in a golden platter
 suhaag ke chunar se usko dhakaa
 With a heavy heart, the war raced towards the land
 usko dekhakar haada sardaar stabdh rah gaya use samaj main na aayaa ki uske netron se ashrudhara kyon bah rahi he? dhire se vah bolaa kyon yadusingh
 Did you bring the queen's sign? Yadu stretched the plate towards him with trembling hands
 haada sardaar fatty ankhon se patni kaa sir dekhtaa rah gaya
 Only Uffi Hi Rani came out of her mouth
 tumne yah kya kar daalaa
 Well done such a big punishment to a suspicious husband
 main bhi tumse milane aa rahaa hum
 Hadra's attachment to the Sardar was broken
 vah shatru par tut padaa
 So much bravery was shown that it is very difficult to get his example
 jivan kii aakhri saans tak vah landta rahaa
 He did not advance to Aurangzeb's auxiliary army until the Mughal emperor fled the field and fled
 is vijay ko shrey kisko? rana rajsinghi ko yaa haada sardaar ko
 Handi Rani or this unique sign of hers? raav jaswant sih yashasvi thi
 khaam kii maadadi :-salumbar ke raav chundawat ratan singh ke liye haada shabd kaa prayog uchit pratit nahin hota hai
 Handi Rani was probably called Handi Rani because she was the daughter of the Hada rulers of Bundi
 sanvaidhanik arthshaastra, arthshaastra or samvidhanwaad ke kshetra main ek anusandhan kaarykram he jise mahaj 'sanvaidhanik kanoon ke aarthik vishleshan' kii paribhaasha se pare "aarthik or raajnneetik agenton ke vikalpon or gatividhiyon ko baadhit karne vaale kanoonee-sansthagat-sanvaidhanik niyamon ke vaikalpik samoohon se sambandhit vikalp" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 This differs from the interpretation of economic and political agents' choices within those rules, which is the subject of a "conservative" economics
 sanvaidhanik arthshaastra "maujuuda sanvaidhanik dhaanche or simaaon yaa us dhaanche dwaara banaai gayi anukool paristhitiyon ke saath prabhavi aarthik faislon kii sangatta" kaa adhyayan karata he
 It has been described as a practical approach to using the means of economics on constitutional matters
 udhaaharan ke liye, prayek desh kii ek pramukh chintaa, uplabdh rashtriya aarthik or vittiya sansadhano ke samuchit rup se aavanton ke sambandh hoti he
 The legal solution to this problem falls within the scope of constitutional economics
 sanvaidhanik arthshaastra "bikri yogya" saamaanon or sevaaon ke vitaran kii gatishiltaa ke kaaryon ke rup main aarthik sambandhon ko simit karne vaale vishleshan ke vipareet, raajnneetik aarthik faislon ke mahatvapurn prabhaavon par dhyaan detaa he
 "political economists who want to provide standard advice must necessarily focus on the process or structure under which political decisions are taken
 maujuuda samvidhan yaa sanrachanaayen yaa niyam "gambhir jaanch kaa vishay hai"
 The term "political economics" was first coined in 1982 by the American economist Richard mckenzie in Washington D
C
 a conference was coined to designate the main topic of discussion
 maikenji ke navnirmit prayog ko us samay ek anya america arthshaastri - james em
 bukanan - ne ek nae shaikshik up-vishay ke rup main apanaaya tha
 It was Buchanan's work on that sub-topic that won him the Nobel Prize for Economic Science in 1996 for his "development of genetic and constitutional grounds for the theory of economic and political decision-making"
 bukanan "budhimatta main shreshth raashtra kii kisi moolbhoot avadharana ko, un vyaktiyon ke liye jo iske sadsy hai" asweekaar karte hai
 This philosophical position is indeed the major subject matter of constitutional economics
 sanvaidhanik arthshaastra kaa drushtikon ek sanyukt aarthik or sanvaidhanik vishleshan kii anumati detaa he jo ek aiami samaj se bachane main madad karata he
 Buchanan believes that the Constitution, intended at least for use by many generations of citizens, is in harmony with the interests of the nation and society for practical economic decisions in their own right towards personal freedom and personal happiness and against individuals and their rights
 Must be able to sit bukanan ne "sanvaidhanik naagarikta" or "sanvaidhanik avyavashtha" kii majboot paraspar-vishyak avadharanaon kii shuruyaat kii
 Constitutional chaos is a modern policy that can best be interpreted as an act done without sociability or taking into account the rules that define the constitutional system
 is niti ko pratispardhi hiton ke aadhaar par nirmit ranneetik kaaryon ke sandarbhon dwaara raajnneetik sanrachana par unke baad main hone vaale prabhaav kii parvaah kiye bina nyyochit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Simultaneously, Buchanan pioneered the concept of "constitutional citizenship" which he designated as citizens' compliance with their constitutional rights and responsibilities that should be considered as a fundamental part of constitutional policy
 bukanan antarnihit sanvaidhanik mandandon ke naitik siddhanton ke sangrakshan ke mahatv ko bhi rekhaankit karte hai
 James Buchanan wrote "the morality of constitutional citizenship cannot be directly compared to moral behavior in interaction with other individuals within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime
" maanak naitik arth main koi bhi vyakti puri tarah se jimmedaar ho saktaa he or is prakaar sanvaidhanik naagarikta kii naitik aavashyaktaa ko puraa karne main asamarth hota he
 "buchanan considered the term" constitutionalism "in a broader sense and used it in families, companies and public institutions but firstly for the country
 bukanan ke nobel vyaakhyaan main 19veen sadi ke uttararddh ke swedish arthshaastri nat vickcel ke kaary kaa ullekh kiya jinhone bukanan ke shodh ko kaaphi prabhavit kiya tha: "agar samudaay ke prayek alag-alag sadsy ke liye upyogita shunya hoti he to samudaay ke liye kul upyogita shunya ke alaava kuch nahin ho sakati he
 In the archive of the chapter on the Nobel Lecture titled "this" The Constitution of Economic Policy ", Wickell states that" whether the benefits of the work offered to individual citizens outweigh their costs, it is estimated by those individual individuals No one can do better than this
 ludwig vaan den howey kii ek mahatvapurn raay he ki sanvaidhanik arthshaastra sudhaarwadi pravriti kii paryaapt prerana ko aakarshith karti he jo adam smith ke drushtikon kii pahchaan he or yah ki bukanan kii avadharana ko aadhunik-kaal main uske samakaksh mana ja saktaa he jise smith ne "kaanoon kaa vigyaan" kaha tha
 " sanvaidhanik arthshaastra ke siddhant or abhyaas main aam janata kii badhati dilchaspee ne pehle hi "kanstitusnal political iconomi " jaisi vishisht shaikshik patrikaon ko janm diya he
 Judge Richard Posner had emphasized the importance of a constitution for economic development
 ve ek samvidhan or aarthik vikaas ke bich aapasi sambandh kii jaanch karte hai
 Posner views constitutional analysis primarily from the point of view of judges' understanding of what constitutes an important power to interpret and use a constitution, thus forming a framework of virtually constitutional law in common law
 ve "nyaayik vivek ke prayog ke liye vyapak bahari simaaon ko sthapit karne main" sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ke mahatv par jor dete hai
 Thus a judge is first guided by a letter of conscience and constitution when trying on a case
 is prakriya main arthshaastra kii bhoomika samvidhan kii "vaikalpik vyakhya ke parinaamon kii pahchaan" main madad karnaa he
 He further states that "economics can provide insight to questions that apply to proper legal interpretation
 " ant main jaisaa ki nyaayadhish posnar jor dete hai, "sanvaidhanik maamalon kaa faisla karne ke liye aarthik drushtikon kii simaaen samvidhan dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati 
" iske alaava unka tark he ki "buniyadi aarthik adhikaron kaa prabhavi sangrakshan aarthik vikaas ko badhaava detaa he
 " 1980 ke dashak main america main sanvaidhanik arthshaastra ke kshetra main shaikshik anusandhan main hui vruddhi ke saath bharat ke sarvocch nyaayalay ne lagbhag ek dashak tak bhartiya samvidhan ke kai anuchhedon kii ek bahut hi vyapak vyakhya kaa upyog karte hue garibon or daliton kii ore se janhit sambandhi mukademon ko badhaava diya
 It is a vivid example of the actual practical application of the process of constitutional economics
 kanstitusnal court of rasian federation ke president velri jorkin ne sanvaidhanik arthshaastra kii shaikshik bhoomika ke liye ek vishesh sandarbh banaaya ek, "rus main sanvaidhanik arthshaastra jaise nae shaikshik vishyon ko vishvavidhyalay ke kaanoon evam arthshaastra vibhaagon ke paathyakram main shaamil kiya janaa atyant mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 " rasian skool of kanstitusnal iconomix kii sthapana ikkisvin sadi kii shuruyaat main is vichaardhaara ke saath hui thi ki sanvaidhanik arthshaastra kanoonee prakriya main ek sanyukt aarthik or sanvaidhanik vishleshan kii anumati detaa he, is prakaar yah aarthik or vittiya nirnay lene kii prakriya main manamaanepan se ubarne main madad karata he
 For example when military spending reduces budget spending on education and culture
 sanvaidhanik arthshaastra aise muddon ko rashtriya dhan ke uchit vitaran ke rup main adhyayan karata he
 It also includes the government's spending on the judiciary, which in most transitional and developing countries is fully controlled by the executive
 isse kaaryakari shaktiyon par "nigaraanee " ke siddhanton ko nuksaan pahunchaata he, kyonki yah nyaaypalika kii ek gambhir vittiya nirbharta utpann karata he
 It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the nation and the private
 National corruption of the judiciary makes it almost impossible for any business to promote optimal growth and development of the national market economy
 angreji bhashaa main "samvidhan" shabd main main anek arth nihit hai jisamen naa keval is prakaar ke rashtriya samvidhan balki nigamon ke charter, vibhinn klbon ke alikhit niyam, anaupchaarik samooh aadi sannihit hai
 The Russian model of constitutional economics, which was originally designed for transitional and developing countries, focuses entirely on the concept of the country's constitution
 sanvaidhanik arthshaastra kaa yah model is samaj par aadhaarit he ki samvidhan or vaarshik aarthik niti, bajet ke kaanoon or sarkaar dwaara banaayi gayi prashasnic nitiyon dwaara pradutt aarthik or saamaajik adhikaron ke bich ke antar ko kam karnaa aavashyak he
 In 2006 the Russian Academy of Sciences officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-subject
 chunki parvarti raajnneetik or aarthik pranali vaale kai desh apane samvidhan ko desh kii aarthik niti se alag ek sankshipt kanoonee dastavej maanate aa rahe hai, is prakaar sanvaidhanik arthshaastra kaa prayog desh or samaaj ke loktantric vikaas ke liye ek nirnaayak shart ban jaataa he

 iran kii islamic kranti san 1979 main hui thi jiske falswaroop iran ko ek islamic ganraajya ghoshit kar diya gaya tha
 This revolution is called the greatest revolution in the world after the state revolution of France and the Bolshevik revolution
 iske kaaran pahalavi vansh kaa ant ho gaya tha or ayatollah khomeni iran ke pramukh bane the
 
 iran kaa nayaa shashan ek dharmatantra he jahaan sarvocch netaa dharmik imam hota he par shashan ek nivraachit raashtrapati chalaata he
 Significantly, Iran is a Shia dominated country
 is kranti ke pramukh kaarnon main iran ke pahalavi shaskaon kaa pashchimi deshon ke anukaran tathaa anugaman karne kii niti tathaa sarkaar ke asafal aarthik prabandh the
 Soon after, Iraq's new ruler, Saddam Hussein, invaded Iran for fear of instigating an Iran-backed Shia movement in his country that lasted for 8 years and ended in a draw
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki san 1941 main angrezon tathaa roosiyon ne iran par adhikaar kar liya tha - yadhyapi sainik tathaa likhit rup se aisa kuch nahin hua tha
 Raza Shah himself began to support the German Nazis
 mitra rashtron ko dar tha ki yadi ve aage na aae to iran germany ke saath chalaa jayega
 Iran was very important militarily because it not only had oil deposits but it was geographically located between Asian Soviet Russia and British India
 aal - soviet khalal ke pehle iran main kisi bhi german ne sainik aatank nahin failaayaa tha
 In 1942, Germany began to exert pressure on the oil fields of the Caucasus
 hanlanki raza shah ne shuru main germanon kaa samarthan kiya tha par baad main wo german adhipaty kii bhavi sambhaavna ko dekhakar unke kilaaf ho gaya tha
 Here, Russia and Britain became friends due to Hitler invading Russia, so both together held the suzerainty over Iran's power till August 1941
 shah ne ek tarah se yah sab hone de diya
 Around this time there were anti-british movements in Iraq
 german sena uttari africa main bhi aa gai thi
 When Russia and Britain ceased to cooperate with Germany-occupied lands in Europe, they saw Iran as a new route and they took control of Iran by August 1941
 iran ke shah ne pehle to naziyon ke aryikaran par sahyogi kii bhoomika bataai thi par baad main ve naziyon yaa samyavaadiyon ke shashan ke khilaaf ho gaya tha atah unhone britain ko sahaayak jaisaa ek vikalp chunaa
 Shah relinquished the throne of his son Mohammad Raza and remained in Iran until the end of the Allied War
 iran main angrezon kii upasthiti se sampoorn raashtra apane ko lajjaspad drushti se dekh rahaa tha
 Sharmavanat was at the wrath of the nation - the rule of the new Shah Raza
 1949 main shah ke hatya kii sajeesh kii gai jo vifal rahi
 Prime Minister Mossadik was sentenced to death in the 60s in a ruling in the 60s and died in 1967
 wo ek yogya vyakti tha or uske is hashr ke baad bhi logon kaa gussa shah ke khilaaf bhadkaa
 American presence in Iran increased since 1968 against the Soviets
 khomeni kaa janm san 1902 main khuman main hua tha
 He was from the family of Sayyids who are considered descendants of the Prophet
 unke balykaal main hi mata-pita kaa viyog ho gaya tha or unki shiksha kom main hui thi
 As a result, he had a reverence for the Ulema, which had been diminishing during the Shah's reign
 san 1963-64 main ve mosaddiq ke saath shah kii mukaalifat karne vaale pramukh netaaon main se ek ho gaye
 Due to oil, life in cities became luxurious and poverty in the village increased
 logon ke shashan se kshubdh hone kaa yah bhi ek kaaran tha

 Immediately before the migration from Iran, Shah did one thing that made Prime Minister Shahpur Bakhtiar the chairman of the Regency Council to run the country in his absence
 Bakhtiar decided to confront the ever-increasing opposition
 unhone itullah khumaini ke ek nai sarkaar kaa gathan karne ke iraade par roak laga di, vah phir nahin laute

 Infectious diseases, diseases that are caused by some pathogenic factors like protozoa, fungi, bacteria, viruses, etc
 sankramak rogon main ek sharir se anya sharir main failane kii kshamta hoti he
 Malaria, typhoid, smallpox, influenza, etc
 are examples of infectious diseases
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne kaha he ki duniya bhar main sankramak rog pehle se kahin zyada teji se fail rahe hai or unka ilaaj karnaa zyada mushkil ho gaya he
 In its annual World Health Report 2008, the United Nations agency stated that one or more new diseases are being detected every year since the 1970s, which is unprecedented
 agency ne kaha he ki tapedic jaisi jaani-maani bimariyon ko niyantrit karne ke prayaas bhi simit ho rahe hai, kyonki ve zyada taqatvar or dawaaiyon kii pratirodhi kismon main viksit hoti ja rahi hai
 The World Health Organization has stated that the reason for the spread of infectious diseases is the increase in international air traffic in the last 50 years
 usne pichley 5 varshon main hi 1,100 se zyada vibhinn bimaariyaan failane kii pushti kii he
 The World Health Organization has requested its 193 members to cooperate more with each other in exchanging virus samples to inform them about the spread of diseases and to help develop vaccines
 tikon ke jariye rogon kaa samay purv muqabla karnaa or unhen niyantra main rakhana maanav dwaara rogon ke ilaaj main praapt prashansaneey pragati he
 According to a report published by the World Health Organization, millions of children are still suffering from infectious diseases every year in the world, but twenty lakh of them could have been saved through vaccines
 hamen sarvapratham yah jaananaa chaiye ki tikaa kya he
 The vaccine is actually a product developed based on the processing of a virus, according to Mr
 Wu Chiang, an expert at the Disease Center of China's capital city of Beijing
 ise khaane yaa sui ke jariye maanav sharir main pravisht karaane se maanav sharir main asli vishaanuon kaa muqabla karne kii shakti paidaa kii jaati he
 The vaccine is completely different from the virus, because the virus causes the disease, but the vaccine produces the power to combat the disease
 varsh 1796 main ek british doctor maanav sharir main gaay main hone vaale ek rog ke chechak jaise vishaanu kubox ko pravisht karaane ke jariye chechak kaa ilaaj karne main safal rahaa tha
 This is how humans invented the smallpox vaccine
 varsh 1980 main vishwa chikitsa sanghathan ne chechak kii samaapti kii ghoshnaa kii, jo rog pratirakshan kshamta ke jariye khatm kiya jane vaala pratham rog tha
 After that, humans acquired the ability to produce vaccines for a number of diseases, such as smallpox, plague, whooping cough, Rohini, Hanustambha, measles and mad dog disease through long-term efforts
 sankramak rogon ke mukaable main tikon kii vishesh bhoomika kii vajah se vibhinn deshon main tikaa lagane ko bahut mahatv diya jaataa he
 In China too, this work started long ago
 idhar teji se saamaajik va aarthik vikaas karte china main tikaa lagane ko adhikadhik mahatv diya ja rahaa he or bacchon ko tikaa lagane ke kaary ko vishesh mahatv praapt he
 In China, the work of enhancing disease immunity is done as planned
 china main saat varsh se kam umr ke sabhi bacchon ko polio, khasre, pilia, tapedic, kaali khaansee or rohinee aadi rogon ke tike lagaaye jate hai
 The government spends its main expenses
 bacchon ke maa-baap kaa is par bahut kam kharch aata he
 There has been tremendous progress since the work began in China since the 1970s
 isse chini bacchon kii rog pratirakshan kshamta bahut unnat ho gayi
 According to the Chinese pediatrician, Dr
 Hu Yamei, when China suffered from SARS in 2003, no child in China succumbed to the disease
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki chini bacchon ko khasre kaa tikaa lagaaye jane se unamem sars kaa muqabla karne kii shakti paidaa hui
 That's why very few Chinese children succumbed to SARS in 2003
 sars kii vajah se kisi kisi bachche kii mrityu bhi nahin hui
 It is learned that 15 years ago, China had completed the target of vaccinating 15 percent of its children
 sanyukt raashtra bal kosh, vishwa chikitsa sanghathan or chini swasthya mantralay ne is kaary kii sanyukt jaanch kii or is kaa ucch moolyankan kiya
 Vaccines have greatly reduced infectious diseases like measles in China
 misaal ke liye 1960 ke dashak main isse hone vaali mrityu kii dar prati lakh 2000 se ghatakar 10 tak gir gai
 China had ended smallpox in the year 1960 and in the year 2000 it won the war to eradicate polio
 china sarkaar dwaara bacchon ke liye tay paanch aavashyak tikon ke atirikt chini logon ko apane bacchon ko aspataalon main apane kharch par flu or pilia aadi rogon kaa tikaa lagavane kii suvidha bhi hasil he
 Apart from children, older people can also get necessary vaccines in the hospital for prevention of infectious diseases arising in different seasons
 yahaan yah bhi charchit he ki china main kute bhi khaase zyada hai, isliye logon ko pagal kute ke rog kaa tikaa lagane kii bhi jarurat he
 Chinese experts are now researching new vaccines to combat new infectious diseases
 chini rog nirodh socity ke visheshgy doctor ho shyung kaa kahana he ki chini visheshgy kai naye tikon ke avishkaar main lage hai
 There is also great potential for combating AIDS, cancer and some chronic serious diseases through vaccines

 There is a village in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, India, in Valivolu
 bharat ganraajya ke pradhanmantri kaa pad bhartiya sangh ke shashan pramukh kaa pad he
 According to the Indian Constitution, the Prime Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers of the Central Government and the Chief Advisor to the President
 vah bharat sarkaar ke karypalika kaa pramukh hota he or sarkaar ke kaaryon ke prati sansad ko javabdeh hota he
 In the parliamentary political system of India, the post of head of state and head of government has been completely divided
 saidhantikrup main samvidhan bharat ke raashtrapati ko desh kaa rashtrapramukh ghoshit karata he or saidhantikrup main, shashantantr kii sari shaktiyon ko raashtrapati par nihit karata he
 And the Constitution also specifies that the President shall exercise these rights on the advice of his subordinate officers
 samvidhan dwaara raashtrapati ke saare kaaryakari adhikaron ko prayog karne kii shakti, loktantric rup se nirvaachit, pradhanmantri ko di gayi he
 The constitution sets out the constitutional rights and duties of the Prime Minister in various Articles of its Part 5

 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah swechha se hi mantriparishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he tathaa sabhi nitigat nirnay bhi vahi letaa he
 The link between the President and the Council of Ministers is also the same
 mantriparishad kaa pradhan pravaktaa bhi vahi he
 He leads parliamentary debates in the name of the ruling party
 sansad me mantriparishad ke paksh me ladi ja rahi kisi bhi bahes me vah bhaag le saktaa he
 The coordination between ministers also does the same
 vah kisi bhi mantralay se koi bhi soochna aavashyaktaanusaar mangava saktaa he
 The Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha, and is appointed by the President of India to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha
 is pad par kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he parantu ek vyakti is pad par keval tab tak rah saktaa he jabatak loksabhaa main bahumat uske paksh main ho
 The constitution, in particular, gives the Prime Minister full control over the Union Cabinet
 is pad ke padaadhikari ko sarkari tantra par di gayi atyadhik niyantranaatmak shakti, pradhanmantri ko bhartiya ganraajya kaa sabase shaktishaalee or prabhaavshaalee vyakti banaati he
 Being the leader of a nuclear-armed state, including the world's seventh-largest economy, the second-largest population, the largest democracy, and the world's third-largest military forces, the Indian Prime Minister is counted among the world's most powerful and influential figures
 varsh 2010 main fors patrika ne apni, vishwa ke sabase shaktishaalee logon kii, suchi main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko 18veen sthaan par rakhaa tha tathaa 2012 or 2013 main unhen kramshah 19wein or 28wein sthaan par rakhaa tha
 His successor, Narendra Modi, was named 15th in the year 2014 and 9th most powerful person in the world in the year 2015
 is pad kii sthapana, varttman kartavyon or shaktiyon ke saath, 26 janvari 1947 main, samvidhan ke parvartan ke saath hui thi
 From that time till the present time, a total of 15 office bearers have served on this post
 is pad par niyukt hone vaale pehle padaadhikari jawaharlal nehru the jabaki bharat ke vartmaan pradhanmantri narendra modi hai, jinhen 26 may 2014 ko is pad par niyukt kiya gaya tha
 The Constitution-makers of India influenced the Indian political system to form a parliamentary republic, influenced by the Westminster system, in which the positions of head of state and head of state were completely divided
 bhartiya rajnatik pranali main pradhanmantri kaa pad samvidhan dwaara sthapit shashanpramukh kaa pad he, jisapar saarvbhaumik vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par prajatantrik rup se nirvaachit vyakti ko niyukt kiya jaataa he
 At the same time, the post of the President of India is the post of the President of the Republic of India, who are elected indirectly by the Parliament
 pradhanmantri kaa pad nihsandeh bhartiya rajnatik pranali kaa sabase shaktishaalee evam varchasvpurn pad he
 The Prime Minister ultimately has control over all activities and policies of the Federal Government and the Union Cabinet
 kendriya mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana bhi antytah pradhanmantri hi karte hai
 However, the Prime Minister cannot do the appointment, expulsion and other such functions of the ministers themselves
 mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana raashtrapati dwaara pradhanmantri ke salaah par hota he
 The Constitution of India respectively promulgates a number of legislations that have legally ensured that in normal circumstances, in the case of the executive, the President should have only nominal powers, while the actual powers are in the hands of the Prime Minister
 samvidhan ne pradhanmantri or raashtrapati kii shaktiyon ko bhaag 5 ke vibhinn anuchhedon main kuch is prakaar ankit kiya gaya he: Generally, the Prime Minister is appointed by the President on the basis of the result of the parliamentary general election
 pradhanmantri, loksabhaa main bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa hote hai
 Although the Prime Minister does not have to be a Lok Sabha MP himself, he has to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha and become a member of Parliament within six months of his appointment
 pradhanmantri sansad ke donon sadanon main se kisi bhi ek sadan ke sadsy ho sakate hai
 Historically, there have been many Prime Ministers who were Rajya sabha-mps; In 1966, Indira Gandhi, Deve Gowda and more recently Manmohan Singh, were Rajya sabha-mps
 prayek chunaav pashchaat, naveen sabha kii baithak main bahumat daal ke netaa ke chunaav ke baad, raashtrapati, bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa ko pradhanmantri banane hetu aamantrit karte hai, aamantran sweekaar karne ke pashchaat, sambandhit vyakti ko loksabhaa main matdaan dwaara vishwasamat praapt karnaa hota he
 Thereafter the order of confidence is passed on to the President, after which the Prime Minister and other ministers are administered the oath of office and they are appointed as Prime Ministers at a ceremony
 yadi koi ek dal yaa gathbandhan, loksabhaa main bahumat praapt karne main aksham hota he, to, yah purnatah mahamahim raashtrapati ke vivek par nirbhar hota he ki ve kis vyakti ko pradhanmantripad praapt karne hetu aamantrit karen
 Such a situation is called a state of hung assembly
 trishanku sabha kii sthiti main raashtrapati saadharantah sabase bade dal ke netaa ko nimnasadan main bahumat siddh karne hetu aamantrit karte he
 It is mandatory for a person who accepts the invitation to prove his trust in the Lok Sabha and only then can that person be appointed Prime Minister
 aitihaasik taur par, is visheshadhikaar kaa prayog anek avasaron par vibhinn raashtrapatigan kar chuke hai
 After the resignation of Prime Minister Morarji Desai by President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy in 1977, Chaudhary Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, exercising this same privilege
 iske alaava bhi is visheshadhikaar kaa upyog kar, raashtrapatigan ne 1989 main rajeev gandhi or vishwanath pratap singh, 1991 main narsingh raav tathaa 1996 or 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ko pradhanmantripad par niyukt karne ke liye kiya he
 The cabinet is made up of ministers selected by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President
 bhartiya samvidhan, pradhanmantri pad hetu kisi prakaar kii vishesh arhataayen nirdisht nahin karata he
 But one need has been fixed: the Prime Minister should have the membership of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and they should have majority support in Lok Sabha
 yadi niyukti ke samay paatr, bhartiya sansad ke do sadanon main se kisi bhi sadan kaa sadsy nahin hota he to niyukti ke 6 maheenon ke madhya hi unhen sansad kii sadsyta praapt karnaa anivaary he anyathaa unka pradhanmantritv khaarij ho jaayegaa
 Therefore, the claimant to the Prime Minister must have all the qualifications to be an MP
 bhartiya samvidhan ke pancham bhaag kaa 84vaan anuchhed, ek saansad kii arhataaon ko nirdisht karata he, uske anusaar: a person shall be qualified to be elected to fill a place in Parliament only when— jaisaa ki tisare bindu main vinirdisht he, paatr ko sansad dwaara bhavishya main paarit paatrata ke kisi bhi yogayata par khara utaarna hoga tathaa kyonki pradhanmantri kaa saansad hona anivaary he, atah pradhanmantritv ke paatr ko loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha kaa sadsy hone yogya hone hetu, kuch anya arhataaon par bhi khara utarana hota he, jinamein uskaa vikrut charitra vaala vyakti yaa diwalia ghoshit naa hona, swechha se kisi videshi rajya kii naagarikta praapt kar lenaa, kisi nyaayalay dwaara uskaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya janaa, tathaa raashtrapati yaa rajyapal niyukt hona shaamil hai
 Also, an eligible person should not be an employee of any beneficial post in the service of any office and administrative or non-administrative body under the Central Government, any State Government or any of the aforesaid Government
 saath hi sadan se prastaav-sweekrut nishkasana se bhi paatr kii sadsyta samaapt ho jaati he
 After the appointment, the Prime Minister's disqualification, on any of the foregoing qualifications, is proved in a legal court, then the election of that person is declared void, and he is expelled from the post of Prime Minister
 
 pradhanmantri ko pad kii shapath raashtrapati dwaara dilaai jaati he
 For appointment to the post, the prospective officer is required to take two oaths
 ye donon shapath bhartiya samvidhan kii teesri anusuchee main vinirdisht hai, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 or 219): Types of Pledge or Affirmation: 1 mantripad kii shapath kaa praaroop : 2 Form of Oath of Privacy: saiddhanthik rupatah, padasth pradhanmantri, "raashtrapati ke prasadparyant", apane pad par bana rahata he
 Unlike the President, no time limit has been set for the Prime Minister's term
 atah ek padasth pradhanmantri anishchit kaal tak pradhanmantripad par bana rah saktaa he, basharte ki raashtrapati ko usapar "vishwaas" ho
 The real meaning of this is that a person can hold the post of Prime Minister only as long as the majority in the Lok Sabha is in his favor
 baharhaal, loksabhaa kaa puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh hota he, jiske baad nae chunaav karaaye jate hai, or naveen sabha punah pradhanmantri ke paksh main vishwasamat paarit karti he, yadi nav-nirvaachit sabha pradhanmantri main avishvaas ghoshit kar detii he to phir pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it can be said that the Prime Minister has a full term of 5 years, after which he is reviewed again
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon se purv hi samaapt ho saktaa he, yadi kisi karanvash, loksabhaa sarkaar ke virodh main avishvaas mat paarit kare athwa yadi kisi karanvash, pradhanmantri kii sansad kii sadsyta shunaya ghoshit ho jaae to pradhanmantri, kisi bhi samay, apane pad kaa tyaag, raashtrapati ko ek likhit tyaagptr saunp ke kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister of the country to relinquish his office during his tenure
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal par naa hi kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa he naa koi aayu seemaa nirdisht kii gai he
 India Gateway bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti aavashyak maanata he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah akele hi mantri parishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he
 All policy decisions are taken by him
 raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhyasampark sutara bhi vahi he
 He is also the principal spokesman of the Council of Ministers
 vah parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he
 He can participate in any debate being fought in favor of the Council in Parliament
 mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he
 He can ask for any information from any ministry
 in sab karnow ke chalate pradhanmantri ko bharat kaa sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik vyaktitv mana jaataa he
 The most important reason for the dominance and importance of the Indian Prime Minister is the executive powers conferred on his office bearers
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 74 pradhanmantri ke pad ko sthapit karata he, evam yah nirdisht karata he ki ek mantriparishad hogi jiskaa mukhiya pradhanmantri hoga, jo bharat ke raashtrapati ko "salaah or sahaayta" pradaan karenge
 And Article 75 establishes that the appointment of ministers will be done by the President as per the advice of the Prime Minister, and the minister will also be given various assignments as per the advice of the President, Prime Minister
 atah samvidhan yah nirdisht karata he kii, jahaan sanvaidhanik kaaryakari adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ke paas he, parantu kyonki in sambandhon main bharat ke raashtrapati keval pradhanmantri kii salaahnusaar kaary karte hai, atah vaastavik rup se, in kaaryakari adhikaron kaa prayog pradhanmantri apni icchaanusaar karte hai
 The constitution establishes by these legislations that as the head of the nation of India, the Prime Minister shall exercise all the executive powers vested indirectly, and will be the head of the entire Council of Ministers and constitution of the Council of Ministers by Article 75, appointment of ministers
 And his assignment has also been left to the will of the Prime Minister, but also the ministers and ministers
 The Constitution, the Prime Minister in relation to schools provides complete freedom
 pradhanmantri, apane mantrimandal main kisi bhi vyakti ko shaamil kar sakate he, nikaal sakate he, niyukt kar sakate hai yaa nilambit karvaa sakate hai
 Since ministers are appointed by the President only on the advice of the Prime Minister, it means that the Council of Ministers is actually created by people of the Prime Minister's choice, in which they can change at any time of their choice
 saath hi mantriyon ko vibhinn kaarybhaar pradaan karnaa bhi purnatah pradhanmantri kii ichha par nirbhar karata he; ve apane mantriyon main se kisi ko bhi koi bhi mantralay yaa kaarybhaar saunp sakati hai, chin sakate hai yaa doosraa koi kaarybhaar / mantralay saunp sakate hai
 In these cases there is no constitutional obligation of any kind to the Prime Minister to consult the ministers concerned, or to obtain their permission
 balki mantriyon va mantralayon ke vishay main purvakthith kisi bhi maamle main sambandhit mantri yaa mantriyon kii salaah yaa anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 They can also ask any minister to resign from the minister any time they want, and if that minister refuses to resign, they can ask the president to suspend him from office
 mantriyon kii niyukti evam mantralayon ke aavnton ke alaava, mantrimandaleey sabhaayen, cabinet kii gatividhiyaan or sarkaar kii nitiyon par bhi pradhanmantri kaa puraa niyantran hota he
 The Prime Minister is the constitutional head and leader of the Council of Ministers
 ve sansad evam anya manchon par mantriparishad kaa pratinidhitiv karte he
 They preside over cabinet meetings, and decide the agenda of these meetings, and other topics of discussion
 balki cabinet baithkon main uthne vaale saare maamle va vishaysoochee, pradhanmantri kii hi sweekruti va sahmati se nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 It is at the will of the Prime Minister to approve or reject various proposals that arise in cabinet meetings
 haalaanki, charchaa karne or apane nijee suzav va prastaavon ko baithak ke samaksh rakhane kii swatantraaa har mantri ko he, parantu antytah vahi prastaav yaa nirnay liya jaataa he, jisapar pradhanmantri kii sahmati ho or nirnay paarit kiye jane ke pashchaat use puure mantriparishad kaa antim nirnay mana jaataa he, or sabhi mantriyon ko pradhanmantri ke us nirnay ke saath chalanaa hota he
 Therefore, it can be said that as a constitutionally, the Prime Minister has complete control and unchallenged dominance over the Union Cabinet
 niyantran ke maamle main pradhanmantri, mantriparishad kaa sarvesarva hota he, or uske istife se puri sarkaar gir jaati he, arthath saare mantriyon kaa mantritv samaapt ho jaataa he
 Apart from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, the Constitution vests another special privilege on the Prime Minister, this privilege being the mid-contact thread between the Council of Ministers and the President
 yah visheshadhikaar keval pradhanmantri ko diya gaya he, jiske madhyam se pradhanmantri samay-samay par, raashtrapati ko mantrisabha main liye jane vaale nirnay or charchaaon se sambandhit jaankaree se raashtrapati ko adhishuchet karaate rahete hai
 No minister other than the Prime Minister can voluntarily reveal to the President any of the subjects discussed in the Council
 yah visheshadhikaar kii mahatv va arth yah he kii mantrimandaleey sabhaaon main charchit vishyon main se kin jaankariyon ko gopneey rakhana he, evam kin jaankariyon ko duniya ke saamne prastut karnaa he, yah tay karne kaa adhikaar bhi pradhanmantri ke paas he
 The Prime Minister works as the Chief Manager of the various organs of the state, whose job is to get all the departments and organs of the state to do the work as they wish
 sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon or mantralayon ke bich samanvay bananaa, or cabinet dwaara liye gaye nirnyon ko karyanvit karwaanaa tathaa vibhinn vibhaagon ko nirdeshit karnaa bhi unka kaam he
 It is also their job to resolve administrative differences between ministries and departments and take final decisions
 sarkari kaaryon ke karyanvayan ke alaava bhi, sarkari tantra par pradhanmantri kaa atyadhik prabhaav or pakad hota he
 Being the head of government and government, all the executive appointments are actually made by the Prime Minister
 saare ucchstareey adhikari va padaadhikari pradhanmantri, apane pasand ke hi niyukt karte hai
 These appointments include high-advisors and high officials of government ministries and offices, governors of various states, attorney generals, auditors, overlords of public service commissions, and other members, ambassadors of various countries, consulars, etc
 yah saare ucchstareey niyuktiyaan, bharat ke raashtrapati dwaara, pradhanmantri kii salaah par kiye jate hai
 Being the head of the government and the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority and the leader of the ruling house and the principal representative in the Lok Sabha

 dammam, eastern provins kaa sabase bada shahar he or saudi arab main riyaad or jedda ke baad yah teesraa sabase bada shahar he
 King Fahd International Airport is available to Dammam and the rest of the Eastern Province, which is the largest airport in the world by land area and is located approximately 20 kilometers northwest of the city
 dammam kaa king abdul ajij si port, faras kii khadi main sabase bada he

 dammam kii pracheen jaden, itihaas main nazar aati hai
 The remains of the cemetery, housing and historical references indicate that it was inhabited more than two thousand years ago
 baharhaal, maanav basti ke adhikansh avasheshon ko marusthal kii ret dwaara dafan kar diya gaya or bade paimaane par sadiyon se yah kshetra viraan rahaa
 In early 1923, a family of Al Dosari tribe and several families of Hovela settled here in Ad Dammam
 in pariwaron kaa netritv shaikh ahamed ebn abdullah ebn hasan al dosari karata tha jo bahrain se aayaa tha or in pariwaron ko echarem swargeey raja abdulajiz dwaara basane ke liye bhoomi chunane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Soon Ad Dammam was chosen to see that the island of Bahrain was close by and the clan was expected to return there soon, but as British rule was established in the region, it was very important for them to do so It became difficult and eventually he realized that it would be better for him to settle there permanently
 kai saal baad, shaikh ahamed kaa bhai dakshin chalaa gaya jahaan vah or uskaa parivaar al khobar main bas gaye jo ki us samay pehle se hi basaa hua tha
 This small episode, however, boosted the population in Khobar and led to closer ties with the big city of Dammam
 "dammam" kaa mul naam vivaadaaspad he, kuch logon kaa kahana he ki yah dhwani anukaranaatmak he or is ilaake ke nazadik hi ek drum rakhe hone ke kaaran is kshetra ko yah naam diya gaya, jab ise chetavanee ke liye bajaay jaataa tha to isse ek madhur dhwani nikalati thi jise "damdamah" kehete the, anya logon kaa maananaa he ki is naam ko arabi shabd "davama" ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya he, jo paas ke ek samudri sthal ko ingit karata tha jisase dho logon ko aksar bachanaa hota tha
 When the modern state of Saudi Arabia was established in 1932, the life of many settlements in the region depended on fishing and pearling
 sadi kii aadhe se adhik kii avadhi ke dauraan, is kshetra kaa vikaas udyog, vaanijya or vigyaan ke centre ke rup main hua or kareeb paanch lakh log yahaan rahane lage
 Changes started here with the discovery of commercial quantities of oil in the region
 purvi praant, duniya ke ek sarvaadhik bade tel maidan ke sheersh par sthit he or vah dahraan hi tha jahaan saudi arab kii rashtriya tel company, saudi aramko kii purvavarti aramko ne 1936 main prasiddh dammam number 7 kuan khoda jisane bina kisi shaq ke yah siddh kar diya ki is samrajya main hydrocarbon kaa ek vishaal aapurti bhandar he
 New oil fields in the south, west and north of Dammam were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s, now known for a quarter of the world's proven oil reserves, and which encouraged building construction in response
 is desh or duniya bhar se visheshgy or takanisian nae tel ke kshetron kii khoj main madad karne ke liye or unhen dhara par laane ke liye ekatra hue
 nai pipelinon ko sthapit kiya janaa tha, bhandaaran suvidhaon kaa nirmaan karnaa tha or tankeron ko sanbhaalane ke liye jaiti kaa nirmaan kiya janaa tha
 The increasing number of specialists working in Dhahran required housing, construction of hospitals, schools for their children and other facilities
 bina adhik antaraal ke, dahraan, saudi aramko kaa korporate mukhyalay jo duniya main sabase badi tel company thi, registan main sabhi dishaao main failane lagi
 The development of the oil industry in the region had similar effects on the small fishing villages of Dammam and the village of Al Khobar
 Within two decades of the discovery of oil, the mud houses of fishermen mostly built on the seabed and which were the only permanent dwellings in the area, soon turned into concrete buildings, modern dwellings, highways and orchard paths
 parasian gulf tat par dahraan ke purv main sthit al khobar sankshipt rup se saudi arab ke kachche tel ke liye bahrain main rifinary kaa ek shipping kendra ban gaya
 In the early years of World War II, oil production in Saudi Arabia was very limited and as the company had no refinery of its own, most of the oil was sent to Bahrain by small tankers
 bahrain tak ek pipe line ke nirmaan or yuddh ke baad ke varshon main tel udyog main vistaar ke baad shipping or tel udyog kaa dhyaan al khobar ke uttar kii ore dammam or raas tanura main sthanantarit hua, jo ki duniya bhar main ek sabase bada tel bhandaaran or shipping kendra he or dammam ke uttar 25 kimi duuri par sthit he
 As a result, Al Khobar gradually gained a new role as a commercial center for the entire region
 1980 ke dashak ke prarambh main purvi kshetra kii rajdhani dammam ek alag shahar tha, lekin al khobar or dahraan se vah itnaa kareeb tha ki ek yatri kuch hi minuton main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan main ja saktaa tha
 Dammam was more affected than any other city in Saudi Arabia by the discovery of oil in Dahran and its surrounding areas and the increasing importance of the entire region
 teen dashakon ke bheetar, machhlee pakadaney vaala yah chota sa gaanv eastern provins kii rajdhani ban gaya
 The simultaneous development of Dammam and Dahran and Al Khobar merged the three jurisdictions, the three cities were essentially merged into one and created a single municipality known as the Dammam Metropolitan Area, commonly known as the Dammam Area
 Is referred to as
 dammam kshetra kaa gathan karne vaale teenon shaharon ne apni khud kii visheshtaayen or kuch sthaneey prashasnic kaaryon ko banaae rakhaa he lekin kingdom main apni sthiti ke aadhaar par dammam kshetra ek ekal prashasnic ikai he
 The development of Saudi Arabia's oil industry in most parts of the world led to rapid development in the region
 jaise-jaise tel utpaadan main vruddhi hui, vaise-vaise is udyog ko chalaane ke liye adhik logon kii aavashyaktaa hui
 The growing population needed more housing and services
 uttam darje ke aspataalon or skulon ne logon ko is kshetra main aane ke liye prerit kiya
 The service industry flourished to assist the oil industry and to meet the needs of the people living in the Dammam area
 natijatan, ek aisa kshetra jahaan tees saal pehle kuch sau nivasee the aaj vahaan kii jansankhya badhkar das lakh ho gai he, yahaan jansankhya main vruddhi prativarsh paanch pratishat se bhi adhik raftaar se ho rahi he
 One of the main reasons for the immense success of the Dammam region is that unlike other oil cities in the world, it has developed in all areas
 vartmaan main yah ek aadhunik shahari or audyogic kendra he jo ki saudi arab ke tel udyog kaa mukhyalay hone vaala he
 Since the region was growing in the early years, the Saudi Arabian government took steps towards the development of the Dammam region
 New roads and highways added the state to other cities and industrial centers in the Kingdom
 ek railway line dwaara al kharj ke krishi kendra ke liye or riyaad ke liye dammam ko joda gaya
 The Daharan International Airport was established between Dhahran and Al Khobar to establish connectivity with the region and other parts of the world
 tel ke alaava anya udyogon ke vikaas ko protsaahit karne ke liye ek audyogic shahar ko teen shaharon ke bich khuli jagah main sthapit kiya gaya
 Where currently more than 124 factories are located, the industrial complex is completely surrounded by the urban population
 parinamswaroop, ek duusare audyogic shahar ko dammam kshetra se thodi duuri par riyaad rajmarg ke saath sthapit kiya gaya he
 Situated on nearly 6,000 acres of land, this second industrial city has 120 factories in addition to 160 under-construction factories
 in kaarkaanon main kai prakaar ke upabhokta utpaadon or audyogic utpaadon kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he jiskaa vipanan sampoorn kingdom main hota he or duniya bhar ke anya deshon main niryaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 Shipping agents and commercial companies responsible for handling such exports as well as imports from abroad are located in Dammam and Al Khobar, making the Dammam region a major oil producer and export area, plus a commercial and shipping hub

 These are supplemented by hospitals and clinics set up by the private sector

 The residential areas are separated from the commercial sections, the roads are broad and straight and the buildings are designed to conform to a master plan
 kshetra ke vikaas kii mukhya visheshtaon main se ek visheshta bhoomi sudhaar he
 Wide stretches of shallow waters of the bay have been filled and where once marshes used to be there are hotels and office buildings today
 gharelu, shahari or audyogic upyog ke liye pani kii aapurti vilwanikaran kaarkaanon dwaara kii jaati he jo lagbhag prati din kshetra ke liye saat million ghan feet kii aapurti karte hai
 The availability of water strengthens the urban and industrial development of the Dammam region and provisions for expansion of existing desalination facilities have been made to cater for future development
 dammam-dahraan-khobar kshetra nauvahan, tel, vaanijya or udyog ke liye ek pramukh centre hai
 Tankers carry oil from the terminal at Ras Tanura
 dammam kshetra manoranjan suvidhaon kii vyapak vividhta ke liye bhi prasiddh he, jo nivaasiyon or aagantukon ko samaan rup se uplabdh he
