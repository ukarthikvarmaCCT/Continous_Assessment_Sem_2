 Beowulf demonstrates the importance of European warrior society, in which the relationship between the region's lord and his followers was of paramount importance

 doosraa, unhone da book of revelation ke bhaag or grandal or grandal kii maan ke ghar ke bich samanaataaon ke liye tark diya he
 Third, he compared Jesus' words in the Gospel of Luke to that part of the poem when Beowulf forgives his foe Anforth

 In the context of human resources, the substitution of an employee by another employee is called laborious or labor substitution
 kisi sanghathan se koi karmchaaree kai kaarnon se alag ho saktaa he- nishkasana, sevanivritti, mrityu, sthaanantaran, tyaagptr aadi
 The turnover rate of an organization is expressed as a percentage of the total number of employees leaving the organization at a given time, ie shramavart kii vruddhi ke anek kaaran hai
 Death and retirement are the two natural factors that cause the labor to be separated from his work
 saath hi yah sthaan sheeghra hi bhar liye jate hai taaki utpaadan prakriya main baadha na pade
 Voluntary withdrawal from work by workers is another important factor that increases labor turnover
 yah do roopon main vyakt hota he, pehla tyaag patr ke rup main tathaa doosraa, kaary parityag ke rup main
 In the first place, the worker expresses his desire to resign from the work and duly informs the manager to express his intention to leave the work while in the second form he leaves the work without being told
 tyaagptr ke liye anek kaaran uttaradaayi ho sakate hai
 For example - getting a better job, not accepting the conditions of the institute, being insulted under the institute, being inappropriate of the institute, getting involved in family matters, etc
 teesraa mahatvapurn kaarak nishkasana he
 Several factors may also be responsible for the removal
 udaahranarth, anushaasanheenata kaa pradarshan, kaary kaa gunatmak or parimanatmak drushtikon se uchit rup main na kiya janaa, santhaan ke viruddh baghawat, kaary ke samay bina avkaash liye anupasthit rahanaa ityadi
 We can divide the results of labor in three parts
 shramavart ke parinaamon ko ham teen bhaagon main vibhajit kar sakate hai
 Direct Results: Those are the results which include the expenses incurred for training of newly recruited workers, as well as small expenses incurred in the life of the recruited person

 Additional expenses incurred before hiring new workers: This loss occurs because there is also time to recruit new workers in place of old workers
 us samyaantar main utpaadan gir jaataa he jisase ki santhaan ko kshati pahunchati he
 High rates of labor cannot be helpful in inducing stability and devotion and credibility in industrial relations and employees
 shramavart k dushprinaamon ko tabhi roka ja saktaa he jabaki isse sambandhit aankadon kaa vishwasaneeyata ke saath satat ekatrit kiya jaay or unke vishleshan main un karka ko dhundha jaay jo ki badalati hui paristhitiyon main shramavart kii ucch daron ke liye uttaradaayi rahe hai
 The exit interview has emerged as an effective tool to reduce labor rates in industrially progressive Western countries
 iske antargat carmik vibhaag dwaara ek toli kii niyukti kii jaati he jo is baat ke liye satat karyrat rahati he ki shramikon ke santhaan se algaav kaa kya kaaran he, yah aichhik he yaa anaichhik
 Whenever a resignation letter is received, the laborer who resigned is interviewed and is given complete freedom to express his feelings without fear and hesitation
 yadi shramik kaary ko bina soochna ke hi chhod jaataa he to is baat kaa satat prayaas kiya jaataa he ki usase vahiin sambandh sthapit kiya jaye jahaan vah mil sake or un tathyon ko prakaash main laane kii koshish kii jaati he jinke kaaran shramik kaary ko chhodkar chalaa gaya tha
 If the matter is of retrenchment or dismissal, then a full examination is made as to whether the action taken is done under the provisions of labor laws and permanent ordinances

 Thus the manager finds himself capable of deciding whether the high rate of labor in his organization is due to poor working conditions, or the achievement of good work elsewhere, the labor policy or behavior of the management, the workers' own mistakes
 Or misconduct is the drabness of the behavior or work of the union leaders; Which of these factors is responsible for the high rate of labor, and what preventive measures can be adopted to eliminate them
 is prakaar ke bahirgaman saakshatkaaron ke pareekshan hetu prabandhakon ko apane-apane sansthaanon ke antargat avasar avashya pradaan kiya janaa chahie taaki ucch shramavart kii daron ke karkon kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake or unako samaapt karne ke liye nirodhatmak upayon ko bhi dhundha ja sake
 To run this process smoothly, joint committees of Malika and Laborers should be formed in each institution
 in samitiyon main maalikon or shramikon ke pratinidhi hone chahie
 Also, joint efforts should be made in this direction
 saamanyatya shramavart kam karne ke liye moulik rup se un sabhi upayon kaa apanaaya janaa chahie jo tyaag patr or nishkasana se sambandhit hua karte he
 In order to reduce the resignations, they will have to do all the work while improving the conditions and conditions of the work under the institute so that the workers can experience a sense of satisfaction and do not hurt their self esteem at any level
 shramik ko jo vetanman santhaan ke baahar praapt ho saktaa he use santhaan ke antargat utana vetan avashya diya janaa chahie
 In order to reduce expulsion, workers will have to reduce disloyalty by increasing their sense of devotion to work and institution
 iske liye shramikon ke saath prabandhakon, nirikshakon evam sahakarmiyon ko sahanubhuti purna vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 Workers should be given an opportunity to participate in management, as well as to overcome the difficulties experienced by them, reduce the plurality of labor unions and develop democratic values among the workers so that mutual respect in their own class To be increased

 This was followed by gas turbines of various designs, the following being the first: the first polynomial centrifugal compressible gas turbine manufactured by Armegund and Lemal in France in 1905, the stationary volume turbine manufactured by Dr
 Holgeworth in 1905 AD, 1908 AD Impulse turbine manufactured by Karbodine in France, explosion type turbine built by Bishanf in 1913 AD and Bischoff in 1914 AD Constant-pressure turbine

 The only difference is that air is used instead of steam here

 Compressed air is brought into the combustion chamber, in which the air is heated with the help of fuel

 Air exits after working
 adarsh gas terbine se guzarane vaali gaison par teen ooshmaagthik prakriyaayein kii jaati hai, ye hai- These three together are called the Bresson cycle
 dahan karne kii do pranaliyaan vyavhaar main laai jaati hai : The static pressure cycle is found to be good in these two systems
 gaise tarabine main vyavahrut ushmagatiki chakra hai : In the first type of cycle, fresh air from the atmosphere enters the compressor and after working in the turbine is expelled into the atmosphere itself, but in the second type of cycle, fresh air does not come from outside, but the repeated transport of the same air or gas it happens
 tarabine kii dakshata ko badhaane ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke upkaran vyavhaar main laae jate hai, jinamein nimnlikhit mukhya hai : The compressed air enters the compressed air from one side and the gas expelled by the turbine from the other side
 gas sampeedit vaayu se adhik garam hoti he
 That is why thermal gas enters compressed air and the compressed air becomes even more heated
 sampidit vaayu ke adhik garam hone se dahanakaksh main idhan kii kam aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This increases the efficiency of the entire plant
 sampeedan ke kaary main kuch bhi kami hone se uplabdh shakti kii vaddhi ho jaati he, jisase sanyantr kii dakshata bad jaati he
 To reduce the work of compression, the air is compressed into a low pressure compressor and enters the coolant, where its temperature is lowered and sent to be compressed into a high pressure compressor
 pratham tarabine main kaary karne ke baad gas punastaapak main pravesh karti he, jahaan ise punastapit kiya jaataa he
 The gas enters the second turbine to operate from the recirculator

 This type of compressor is used more in industrial gas turbine, because it gives higher pressure ratio and higher efficiency
 apkendrik sampidak halkaa hone ke kaaran vayuyan main adhik vyavahrut hota he
 As mentioned above, compressed air is heated in this chamber with the help of fuel

 Work is achieved by this
 tarabine kii sahaayta se sampidak ko chalaaya jaataa he, jisase tarabine main praapt kaary kaa kuch bhaag sampidak ko chalaane main kharch ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the available power = the work received by the turbine - the work spent in the compressor gas tarabine kii ushmiya dakshata tarabine main kaary karanevaale gaise ke praveshtap par nirbhar karti he
 The higher this temperature, the higher the efficiency, but before increasing the heat of the gas, the material treated for the turbine panels must also have the ability to work at that temperature

 But these problems are not incurable
 shamsuddin iltutamish dilli sultanate main ghulaam vansh kaa ek pramukh shaasha tha
 After the founder of the dynasty, Qutub-ud-din Aibak, he was among the rulers that strengthened the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate
 vah aibak kaa damaad bhi tha
 He ruled from 1211 AD to 1236 AD
 rajbhishek samay se hi anek turk amir uskaa virodh kar rahe the
 Impressed by Iltutmish's work efficiency against the Khokhars, Muhammad Ghori gave him an important position called "amirul Umra"
 aksmaat mutyu ke kaaran qutubaddeen aibak apane kisi uttaradhikari kaa chunaav nahin kar sakaa tha
 So the Ottoman authorities of Lahore put the disputed son Aramshah of Qutb-ud-din Aibak to the throne of Lahore, but as a result of the opposition of the Turko chieftains and citizens of Delhi, Iltutmish, son-in-law of Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who was then the Subedar of Badaun, was invited to Delhi on the throne

 Iltutmish had two major rivals - Tajuddin Yaldauj and Nasiruddin Kubacha
 ye donon gauri ke das the
 Yaldauj considered the state of Delhi as a part of Ghazni and kept trying hard to merge it with Ghazni, while Aibak and then Iltutmish considered themselves independent

 After his defeat, no ruler of Ghazni asserted his claim to power in Delhi
 kubacha ne punjab tathaa uske aasapaas ke kshetron par apni sthiti majboot kar lee thi
 In 1217 he traveled against Kubacha

 At the same time, the Khalifa also conferred upon him the title of 'sultan-e-azam'

 This acceptance helped Iltutmish to inherit the rank of Sultan and secure the authority of his children on the throne of Delhi

 Iltutmish was the first Ottoman sultan who introduced pure Arabic coins

 Iltutmish started the tradition of inscribing mint names on coins
 sikkon par iltutamish ne apana ullekh caliph ke pratinidhi ke rup main kiya he
 After the Gwalior conquest, Iltutmish inscribed some proud words on his coins, such as "mighty sultan", "empire and sun of religion", "helper of the hero of the righteous"
 iltutamish ne âikta vyavasthaâ kaa prachlan kiya or rajdhani ko lahore se dilli sthaanantarit kiya

 Nasruddin Mahmud, the eldest son of Iltutmish, who was ruling Bengal as his father's representative, died in April 1229 AD
 sultan ke shesh jivit putr shashan kaary ke kisi bhi prakaar se yogya nahin the
 Therefore, Iltutmish appointed his daughter Razia as his successor from his death bed

 kreemia kaa yuddh tak kaala sagar ke aasapaas chalaa yuddh tha, jisamen france, britain, sardenia, turki ne ek taraf tathaa rus ne duusari taraf se ladaa tha
 The 'battle of Crimea' is considered one of the most foolish and inconclusive wars in history
 yuddh kaa kaaran slavvaadi rashtriyata kii bhaavana thi
 Apart from this, on the other hand, the religious atrocities of Turkey also became the cause, but even after very bloodshed, nothing came out
 yah yuddh kadachit akaaran ladaa gaya tha phir bhi europea itihaas main iskaa vishesh mahatv aankaa jaataa he
 In those days, people in European countries had the impression that Russia has so much weapons that it is invincible
 usase log aatankit the
 Russia's policy of expanding the state towards Kustantunia had been in place since the time of Peter the Great
 apni is rajyavistaar kii aakankshapurti ke liye vah koi na koi bahaanaa dhoondhata rahata tha
 This war is considered to be the first such war in which the public got the news of daily battle
 da times akhbaar ke wiliam rasel or roger fenton ne patr main is ladaai kaa vivaran diya tha
 This war began with a small religious dispute
 un dinon philistin, turki samrajya ke antargat tha
 In 1535, the Sultan of Turkey entrusted the care of the shrines of Roman Christians to the French Catholic priests under the patronage of France
 isi prakaar turki sthit unani-isai sampradaay ke dharmik sthaan rus ke jaar ke sangrakshan main die gaye the
 But during the time of the famous French revolution, France could not pay proper attention to its responsibility
 dhire dhire latin dharmasthanon par unani-isai sampradaay ke saadhuon kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 In 1850, FranÃ§aise Napoleon III turned his attention to the Latin Church; He wrote to Turkey to give his management under the patronage of France
 1852 i
 main usne apni is maang ko duharaaya
 The Sultan of Turkey accepted this demand of France after a few handover
 rus ke liye koi kaaran na tha ki vah turki ke is kaary par aapatti karata; kintu usne ise turki ko hadap lene kaa ek acha avasar samajha
 In favor of the greek-christian denomination, the Tsar wrote to the Sultan to return the Latin religious places to him
 isse england ashankit ho uthaa
 He feared that once Russia's authority over Kustuntunia would be a permanent threat to India from the land route and it would be such a danger that it would not be possible for him to face it in any way
 vah rus ke viruddh turki kii sahaayta ke liye uth khadaa hua
 There was a clear reason for France to be angry
 rus uske tirthasthalon kii dekhbhaal ke adhikaar main hastkshep kar rahaa he
 But the greater reason was that Czar Nicholas i addressed the new Emperor of France as 'brother' rather than 'brother'
 isaliye rus ke unani-isai sampradaay kaa pakshdhar banate dekh use apane rajvansh par khatra aata dikhaai padaa
 Austria was also alarmed by the Russian aggression towards the Balkans

 He started leaning towards France and England
 usne british rajdoot ke ishaare par rus kii chunauti ko thukraa diya
 The result of this was to happen
 july, 1853 main rus kii sena ne kooch bol diya or danyube nadi ke uttarvarti turki ke bhubhag-moldavia or balesia ke praanton par aadhikaar kar liya
 Immediately a joint naval fleet of England and France reached Basphorus to assist Turkey; But in view of the English and French warships, the Russian navy near Sinope destroyed the Turkish fleet
 tab janvari,1854 i

 He planned to make his defensive war
 kustutuniya kii raksha ke liye unhone galipoli main kilabandi karne kaa nishchay kiya
 But before the anglo-french forces gathered at Varna on the west coast of Kalasagar, Russia withdrew its forces from the occupied territories of Turkey, seeing Austria's friendly stand
 is prakaar rus dwaara turki par akraman kii sambhaavna samaapt ho gai
 As a result, the situation in England and France became skewed
 varna main joro kaa haija failaa
 The army could not be left there
 duusari ore bina yuddh kiye apni sena ko swadesh lautaa le janaa donon hi desh ke shaskaon kaa apni hinata kaa dyotak jaan padaa
 So, in the interest of doing something, he decided to attack Crimea
 uske dakshini tat par sevastopol main rus kaa nausenic adda tha
 He made it his goal to do it in authority
 durdharsh nirnay to in donon deshon ne le liya par uname se kisi ko bhi kreemia ke bhubhag ke sambandh main koi jaankaree na thi
 When the ardent France experienced this difficulty, she summoned the soul of the Napoleonic great at Planchet and asked for his advice
 rephet ne sevastopol or balklawa ke jo maanchitr taiyaar kiye the unka adhyayan-manan kiya gaya; ranvyuuh-visheshgy jaimini se salaah lee gai kintu koi utsahjanak baat saamne nahin aari
 Only the possibilities of failure were realized
 idhar british mantrimandal ko kisi prakaar ke gambhir chintan kii aavashyaktaa nahin jaan padi
 He looked at the map of Crimea in the usual way and said that it is not a difficult task to cut off the peninsula of Crimea from the mainland by blocking the degree of landmass on the strength of cannons
 unhen tab tak is baat kaa gyaan na tha ki sthaldam degree ke donon ore samudr main do-teen foot se adhik jal nahin he
 He issued orders for the war
 14 sitambar ko senaayen upotoria pahaunchi
 On 17 September, he started Sevastopol and started growing
 20 sitambar ko unhone roosi sena ko haraaya kintu kisi prakaar kaa koi nirnaayak parinaam nahin niklaa
 Russian commander Tadelbein entered the fortress of Sevastopol and made full preparations to protect the fort
 aangl-french sena ne durg par gheraa daal diya
 Before they could take any further action, winter came before it; In the absence of proper food and food system, the soldiers were in a miserable condition
 angareji sena kii sthiti to or bhi kharaab ho gai
 The ships that were carrying their luggage were destroyed in a severe storm in the port of Balaklava

 There was some improvement when Florence Knight Angell arrived with women volunteers and arranged for the care of the sick
 jab sardi kam hui to duusari musiibat uth khadi hui
 The invention of wire facilitated quick contact connectivity
 at: donon deshon ke mukhyalayon se jo aadesh das din main pahonchte the ab 24 ghante main pahunchne lage
 England and France used this feature differently
 england ke liye sainik asafalataa kaa arth mantrimandal main ulatpher kii sambhaavna se adhik or kuch na tha
 Therefore, the War Department only used it to express concern for the health of its captain, Javis
 kintu france ke samrat ke liye to haar rajvansh ke vinaash kaa paigaam tha
 Hence, he began to send daily suggestions, advice and orders to his commander
 falat: donon hi deshon ke senapatiyon ko taron ke is prakaar ke aadan-pradaan ke kaaran mej se uthakar or kuch karne or sochane kii fursat hi nahin rahi
 Nevertheless, by April, they tried to speed up the circle of Sevastopol
 june main angareji sena ne radon par or francisi sena ne melecalf par akraman kiya parantu roosiyon ne donon hi akramanon ko vifal kar diya
 But when the anglo-french army took over Kinburn, Russia considered it futile to continue the war
 is samay tak french naresh napolian bhi is yuddh se ghabara uthaa tha
 He was not in favor of further war
 kintu angarej, jinhen sevastopol ke akraman main asafalataa mili thi, khize hue the
 They wanted to continue the war but it was not enough for them to fight Russia alone
 nidaan paris main ek sandhi hui
 Among other things in this treaty, the main thing was that the Danube River opened up traffic for ships of all countries; Kala Sagar was declared a neutral zone; The warships of each country were prohibited

 The Crimea War was an important event in European history after the Vienna Congress
 is yuddh ke falswarup ek ore jahaan rus kii turki sambandhi yojana vifal ho gai vahiin duusari ore turki ko nav jivan praapt hua
 The Politics of Italy and Germany Unification of Russia This war had a profound effect on the complete construction of the Balkan Peninsula and on international politics
 is yuddh ke kai kaaran the
 which is like this
 rusi niti- In the 19th century, the Turkish empire was declining
 isse phayda uthaakar vibhinn europea raashtra use aapas main baantna chaahate the
 Russia was very particular about it
 vah turki ke maamle main gahari abhiruchi lene laga
 Russia wanted ki turki kamjor pad jaae taaki balcon kshetra main apni samrajya kaa vistaar kar sake
 Therefore, he provoked the subjects of the Balkan Peninsula to agitate against Turkey
 rus kaa uddeshy turki ko samaapt karnaa tha
 And on the ruins of the Turkish Empire, he wanted to build the palace of the huge Russian Empire
 is liye jab bhi mauka mila rus europea ke saamana turki ke batwaare kaa prastaav rakhata tha
 Britain's selfishness england rus kii mahatvakanksha kaa prabal virdohi tha
 Because Russia's entry into the land of the Sea could pose a crisis for England
 saath hi saath turki par rus kaa adhikaar hone se england kaa bhartiya samrajya bhi khatre main pad saktaa tha
 Therefore, he had an important role to protect Turkey from going under the authority of Russia for the protection of the Indian Empire
 england kabhi nahin chahta tha ki purv kii ore uskaa vistaar ho
 Although Russia tried to join England, it could not succeed
 vibhinn prayaason ke baad bhi jab englad rus ke paksh main nahin ho sakaa to use talwaar ke bal par turki ko hadapney kii yojana bananaa shuru kar di
 Selfishness of france europe ke biimaar raashtra turki par france kii najar bhi lagi hui thi
 Louis Napoleon wanted to expand France through war policy
 usne turki ke maamle main hastkshep karnaa shuru kiya
 The Crimean War began as a result of Napoleon's policy
 mohammal ali kaa vidroh or europea rashtron kaa turki main hastkshep- Mohammed Ali was the governor of Mishra
 jo turki samrajya ke adhin tha
 But Mohammad Ali was an independent ruler
 yunaan ke swatantraaa sangram main turki ko sahaayta dene ke babajood use koi laabh nahin hua tha
 Therefore, he took military action against Syria
 isapar turki kaa shultan ghabara gaya
 He received help from Russia
 isse vibhinn rashtron main bejaini bad gai or pramukh europea deshon ne rusi sena ko waapas karnaa ke liye turki par yah dabaav daalana shuru kiya ki ve mohammad ali ke saath samjhauta kar le
 As a result, Mohammed Ali was given Syria
 idhar rus apni sahaayta ke badale turki se kuch naa kuch puraskaar chahta tha
 In 1832 he entered into a treaty with Turkey by which Russia's influence over Turkey was established
 is ghatana se england chintit ho gaya usne europea rajyon kaa landan main ek sammelan bulaayaa
 All nations signed a treaty
 falat: turki par rus kaa prabhaav kuch kam ho gaya
 After this, peace was maintained for about ten years, but when Louis Napoleon came to France, he started raising the eastern problem by favoring the clergy of the Christianity of Russia
 The Crimea War was the result of it
 dharmik kaaran- The Holy Jerusalem of Christ was under the Turkish Empire
 vahaan roman or unani carch ke sanyasi rahete the
 The Turkish Sultan's dealings with them were not good, so according to the Treaty of 1742, the protection of the Roman monk was placed on Russia
 parantu france ke kranti ke falswarup jab france main avyavashtha fail gai
 So the Greek clergy started attacking the Roman Church
 lui nepolian ne roman padri kaa samarpan karnaa shuru kiya or rus ne unani padri kaa saath dena shuru kiya
 Hence, the Eastern problem started deteriorating
 teen varshon tak is samasya ko lekar europe main kutniti tanaav vyaapt rahaa
 Russia remained a diplomatic strain in Europe
 rus dharmik bahaanaa bana kar turki par akraman kar uske pradeshon par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 In 1853, Russia invaded Turkey and conquered Noldavia and Belesia
 rus par england or fransane turki ko sahaayta dene kaa aashwasan diya turki ko sahaayta dene kaa aashwasan diya 27 farvari 1854 ko england or france ne rus ko sanyukt chetavanee di ki rus turki kaa pradesh khaali kar de
 But due to lack of satisfaction, both of them declared war on Russia
 yahi yuddh kreemia kaa yuddh tha
 In which England, France and Turkey on one side and Russia alone was completely alone, this war lasted for two years
 dhan jan kii apaar kshati hui
 Russia had a massive defeat
 march 1856 main paris ke sandhi ke dwaara yuddh samaapt hua
 Thus the victory of the Egyptian nations and the defeat of Russia took place in the war
 30 march 1856 ko england, france, austria, turki, servia tathaa rus ke pratinidhiyon ne paris sandhi par hastakshar kiya
 Accordingly, the neutral zone of Kalsagar was declared

 Russia's protection over the Mol Divia and Bolegia was abolished

 Turkey was included in the nation group of Europe

 The Crimean War is considered an important event in European history

 Russia had a massive defeat

 The national debt of England increased and Austria made an enemy of a great country

 After the Crimea War, the fall of Turkey was inevitable

 It proved to be a source of inspiration for other subjugated countries
 or videshi apni swadhinata ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe
 The main objective of the Crimean War was to weaken Russia
 parantu yah uddeshy bhi safal nahin ho sakaa
 Thinking that Russia would calm down further proved to be wrong
 mauka milte hi vah purv samasya main pun: kud padaa paris kii sandhi kaa uddeshy rusi mahatvakankshaon par ankush lagaana tha or turki ko jivit karnaa tha parantu yah bhi pari nahin ho sakaa
 Hence it can be said
 ki jin uddeshyon kii purti ke liye yuddh ladaa gaya tha
 From that point of view it proved futile
 england yaa france kisi ko laabh nahin pahunchaa
 But despite this, Crimea war cannot be called a total futile war

 'this national humiliation contained the hopes of the future

 Because after this defeat, there was widespread improvement here, but the most important result of the Crimea War was that its dream of conquering Kustuntunia and making the Black Sea a Russian lake was dissolved
 england par prabhaav- The purpose of England in this war was fulfilled
 rus ke vistaar par pratibandh lag gaya lekin isse england ko dhan jan kii apaar kshati hui uskaa rashtrikar baad diya gaya jisase sudhaar yojanaayen ko lagu karne main kathinaayee hui

And almost half occupied Pakistan, but after Pakistan surrendered, India returned the won land showing leniency! oktober 1947 ko jammu or kashmir ke tatkaaleen shaasha maharaja harisingh ne apni riyasat ke bharat main vilay ke liye vilay-patr par dastakhat kiye the

 idhar junagarh, kashmir, hyderabad or travnakor kii riyaasaten vilay main der laga rahi thim to kuch swatantra rajya chaahati thim

 If the whole of Kashmir was in Pakistan or the whole of Kashmir was in India, the circumstances would have been different
 lekin aisa ho nahin saktaa tha, kyonki kashmir par raja harisingh kaa raaj tha or unhone bahut der ke baad nirnay liya ki kashmir kaa bharat main vilay kiya jaae
 Due to this late decision, Pakistan captured almost half of Kashmir by sending tribesmen to Gilgit and Baltistan

 When an experienced and thoughtless leader Rajiv Gandhi took over the reins of the country in place of a powerful leader, his critics started saying that he has no plan and no policy
 1984 ke dangon ke dauraan unhone jo kaha, use kai logon ne khaarij kar diya
 He shifted his attention completely from Kashmir to Punjab and Sri Lanka

 Under this plan, the people of Indian Kashmir had to sow the seeds of separatism and hatred towards India and then put weapons in their hands

 Actually, it is a developed form of guerrilla warfare
 bhartiya rajanetaaon ko sab kuch maaloom tha lekin phir bhi ve chup the, kyonki unhen bharat se zyada vot kii chintaa thi, gathjod kii chintaa thi, satta main bane rahane kii chintaa tha
 Due to this wavering attitude of Indian politicians, 'operation Topak' in Kashmir continued without any problem and Indian politicians continued to enjoy power by becoming ostrich
 kashmir or purvottar ko chhodkar bhartiya rajaneta sab jagah dhyaan dete rahe
 'operation Topak' reached the first to second and second to third stages
 ab unka iraadaa sirf kashmir ko hi ashaant rakhana nahin rahaa, ve jammu or ladakh main bhi sakriy hone lage
 The Pakistani army and ISI organized riots in Kashmir and after that there was a series of terrorism
 pehle charan main masjidon kii taadaad badhanaa, duusare main kashmir se gairmuslimon or shiyaon ko bhagaanaa or tisare charan main baghawat ke liye janata ko taiyaar karnaa

 Animation can be a kind of visual illusion when 2D and 3D artwork is displayed together in a certain direction
 Animation can also be a kind of visual illusion
 Because it is felt due to the visual brightness of the normal human eye
 You can do animation in many ways
 And you can feel it
 The simplest way is to present it through a movie
 Apart from this, there are many other ways to do it

 In the atomic scale, this tunneling corresponds to the transfer of the conjunctive band electron to the empty conduction band state; This is due to the decreased barrier between these bands and the high electric field induced by the relatively high degree of doping on both sides

 According to this view, the adi-austronesian culture first flourished in Taiwan 5,500 years ago

 The Bible is the cornerstone of Christianity and the holiest scripture of Christians
 iske do bhaag hai : purvavidhan or navvidhan 
 The first half of the Bible is also the scripture of the Old Testament Jews
 bible ishwarprerit he kintu use apaurushey nahin kaha ja saktaa
 God has inspired various writers of the Bible in such a way that they can be called their own creations even though they are Godsized
 ishwar ne bolkar unase bible nahin likhavai
 He certainly tended to write with the inspiration of God, but he has written it according to the characteristics of his culture, style and ideology
 at: bible ishwariya prerana tathaa maanviya parishram donon kaa sammilit parinaam he
 The history and account of what God did for mankind and the Jews and the reaction of man to it is the theme of the Bible
 bible gudh darshanik satyon kaa sankalan nahin he balki isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki ishwar ne maanav jati kii mukti kaa kya prabandh kiya he
 In fact, the Bible is a history of the implementation of divine liberation that began in the Old Testament and was edited by Jesus in the New Testament
 at: bible ke donon bhaagon main ghanishtha sambandh he
 The events of the life of Jesus are laid out by the events of the Old Testament
 new testament main dikhalaayaa gaya he ki muktividhan kis prakaar isa ke vyaktitv, chamatkaaron, shiksha, maran tathaa punarutthan dwaara sampann hua he; kis prakaar isa ne carch kii sthapana kii or is carch ne apane praarambhik vikaas main isa ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko kis drushti se dekha he ki unamem se kya nishkarsh nikaala he
 Incidentally, things related to cosmic knowledge have also come up in the Bible; There is a full impression of the immediate assumptions on them because the Bible hardly wants to give any direction about them
 maanav jati ke itihaas kii ishwariya vyakhya prastut karnaa or dharm evam mukti ko samajhnaa, yahi bible kaa pradhan uddeshy he, bible kii tatsambandhi shiksha main koi bhranti nahin ho sakati
 There is also a description of the sin of humans at many places
 aisa aacharan anukaraniya adarsh ke rup main nahin prastut hua he kintu uske dwaara spasht ho jaataa he ki manushya kitne kalushit hai or unako ishwar kii mukti kii kitni aavashyaktaa he
 It describes ancient Judaism and the stories of Jewish people, mythological stories, myths etc
 isaki mulbhasha ibrani or arami thi
 It is after Christ, which was written by the disciples of Jesus
 isamen isa kii jeevani, upadesh or shishyon ke kaary likhe gayi hai
 Its native language was some Aramaic and mostly colloquial Ancient Greek
 isamen khaas taur par chaar shubhasandesh hai jo isa kii jeevani kaa unke chaar shishyon ke naam se kisi or ke dwaara varnan he : matti, luka, yuhanna or marakus
 The religion book of Judaism is also the Bible, but it contains only the Old Testament
 bible kul milakar 66 granthon kaa sankalan he - purvavidhan main 39 tathaa navvidhan main 27 granth hai
 Holy bibleaudio Bible Project navvidhan ke pratham paanch granth aitihaasik hai arthath chaaron susamachar tathaa acts aav di aposles ke patt shishyon ke kaary
 The last book is called Apocalypse
 isamen susamachar lekhak sant yohan pratikatmak style main carch ke bhavishya tathaa muktividhan kii parinti kaa chitra ankit karte hai
 The remaining 21 texts of the New Testament are Shiksha-pradhan, namely 14 letters of Sant Pal, two letters of Santpeeter, three letters of the saint Yohan, the gospel writer, one letter by Saint Yakub and one by Saint Jude
 sant paal ke patr yaa to kisi sthanvishesh ke nivaasiyon ke liye likhe gaye hai yaa kisi vyaktivishesh ko 
 There is no doubt about the authenticity of the letters of the Hebrews, which are included in the Bible, but despite being influenced by the thoughts of Sant Pal, their author will be someone else
 bivil ke pramanik granthon kii uparyukt suchi main se purvavidhan ke kuch granth ibrani bible main sammilit nahin the, arthath tobias, yudith, makaabi, pragna siraah or daniel evam ester ke kuch ansh
 Jews and many Protestant denominations do not place these texts in their Bible as unproven
 praaia: samast purvavidhan kii mul bhashaa ibrani he
 Many texts have been written in the Greek language and a small fraction in Aramaic
 samast navvidhan kii bhashaa koine naamak unani bolchaal he
 The creation of the Bible dates back to 1400 BC
 It is believed to date back to 100 AD
 iske bahusankhyak lekhakon main se musa sabase pracheen hai, unhone lagbhag 1400 i
pus

 Most of the works of the Old Testament were dated to 900 BC
 And 100 BC Is between samast navvidhan 50 varsh kii avadhi main likhaa gaya he arthath san 50 i

 tak
 The texts which have been included in the Bible are written in many genres, not in the same style - folklore, poetry and hymns, sermons and fables etc
 are found in many literary forms
 adhyayan tathaa vyaakhyaan karte samay prayek ansh kii apni style kaa dhyaan rakhana atyant aavashyak he
 The translation of the Bible has been in operation for centuries
 israeli log ibrani bible kra chhayanuwaad arameyic bolchaal main kiya karte the
 The Jews of Alexandria dated to the second century BC
 i had translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek which is known as Septuargit
 lagbhag san 400 i
 main sant jerome ne samast bible kii latin anuwaad prastut kiya tha jo vulgaataa kehalaata he or shatabdiyon tak bible kaa sarvaadhik prachlit rup rahaa he
 In modern times, the Bible has been translated into more than thousands of languages based on Hebrew and Greek origin
 purvavidhan kaa sarvottam pramanik ibrani paath kittal dwaara tathaa unani paath ralfus dwaara prastut kiya gaya he
 Many excellent authentic Greek texts of the New Testament are found, such as the versions of Tischenfarf, Westcott Hort, Nestle, Vogels, Merck, and Soter
 unani bible kii pracheen hastlipiyon kaa vivaran is prakaar he - Apart from these, 15 complete and more than 4000 partial New Testament Greek manuscripts are available, which are dated between 200 AD and 700 AD

 The following are the most famous translations of the English language - the Ioryazid version or the King James Bible; Taken version; Kafraternity version R
A
 Nix bibril; New English Bible
 unnisvin shatabdi ke prarambh main protestant mishanri kaire ne bible kaa hindi anuwaad taiyaar kiya tha; "dharamshastra" ke naam se iske bahut se sanskaran chap chuke hai or usamen sanshodhan bhi hota rahaa he
 In 2009, Jehovah's Witnesses published a Hindi translation, the New World Translation, the Christian Greek Scriptures, and this translation is also available on their website
 bible ishwar prerit bhi he or saadhaaran manushyon kii rachana bhi he; at: isaki vyakhya main is dohare kartrutv kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Being a masterpiece of man, the Bible should be studied like other cosmic literature; Therefore isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki bible ke vyaakhyaata ke liye bible main ullikhit deshon kii vistrut jaankaree ke atirikt bhashavigyaan, itihaas, bhugol, puraatatv, dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan jaisi anek sahaayak vidhaayen atyant aavashyak hai
 The Bible is inspired by God, so while interpreting it uparyukt niyamon ke dohare paksh kaa santulan rakhana aavashyak he
 Scientific interpretation of the Bible can only be meaningful according to church tradition
 bhugolic drushti se bible kaa prabhaav bahut hi vistrut he
 Maybe it is a contingency
 mulat: ek damit janata ke dharm ke rup main isiyat anek pareekshanon ke pashchaat apane vijiton kaa dharm bani
 The ancient religion of the Bible is spiritually combined with the Quran and Islam and is associated with a chosen elite
 musa athwa isa, abraham yaa suleman muslimon main shraddhey naam hai
 The Bible is different from this
 yah kai granthon kaa nichod he
 This is the entire story of the Jewish people and perhaps the most varied Jewish experiences among the ancient people
 yah aisi jati thi jo khoonkhaar kabeelon se ghiri thi or jo swayan bhi kam khoonkhaar na thi
 Sometimes they were demeaned, conquered and enslaved
 is jati ne kabhi apane shatruon ko vijit kiya tathaa unki shakti aajamaai, phir bhoomisaat kar daalaa 
 It is the aspiration and inspiration and triumph and defeat of one such public who is described in the Bible with amazing vivacity
 usne hamen apane abraham or musa jaise mahaan netaaon, daaud or suleman jaise mahaan raajaaon tathaa mahaan avtaron ke vishay main gyaan karaayaa he jinhone samay samay par utpann hokar apane drudh vachanon dwaara anuchit maarg par arudh janata ko tokaa
 It has been the same sequence till Sevanola
 unhone unki hinsaparayan vritti ko swayan bhoga liya, aalasy or krurta kii ninda kii jisaki ore janata swabhaavat: abhimukh thi
 The Bible also shows about bloodpipes like Abraham, fierce violent kings and uncivilized queens
 yah janata kii aitihaasik ghatnaon or tithiyon kii samhita he
 In the inevitable small boundaries of a book, despite its virtually ethnic history, it is full of surprising truths
 pracheen dharmaniyam kii samaapti ke saath usamen ek aakasmik parivartan hota dikhaai detaa he
 History remains the same but its nature changes
 yahudiyon kaa bhayankar ishwar hataa diya jaataa he or kalpana main bhartiya dhang kaa ek snehi ishwar ubhad aata he
 Perhaps the first blurred images of such a trend are found in some incarnations of the heart of ancient Dharmanium itself, especially in Isaiah etc
 kintu ishwar ke sambandh main yah ibranio kii koi anupatik kalpana nahin he
 His feeling was eye to eye
 lekin jab isa ne unase kaha ki ve unke daayen gaal par thappad jamaanevaale ke saamne apana bayen gaal bhi pher den, ve aise krantikari darshan or hinsa ke nipat asweekaar kii baaten na samaj sake
 Thus, he disqualified the author of this new religious belief and eventually gave it to him
 kintu us din galgotha naamak sthaan par cross se pravaahit raktabinduon kii dhara ne ek nae dharm ko janm diya
 The Christian people see him as a symbol for themselves and preach the words of Jesus
 is prakaar, buniyadi taur par dhairya or prem ne twara or ghrinaa par vijay praapt kii
 No one thought that those who indulged in the homogenously recited singing found in secret and furnished tendons or cottages inside Rome, which were previously only suitable for the sake of the deposits of the fierce Roman festivals, would one day only see the royal power of Rome We will not only shake you, but will build a better and more glorious Rome-like Sanatan Nagar in the coming days
 phir isai log cross rupi shastr se susajjit hokar tamaam rome main fail gaye
 Although here he was not a Roman corps but saints with tables and clergymen, who passed away in thousands laughing to death, he preached biblical messages among Europe's rambunctious and uncivilized people
 bible ke shabdon ne un asabhyon kaa aanshik rup se sabhy banaaya
 Thus the Church or Institute of Christianity continued to dominate Europe's mind for at least a thousand years, with its full coverage
 yahan tak ki saadhaaran se saadhaaran aachaar athwa vichaar-kalpana par bhi isiyat kii chhap rakhti padati thi
 But the same church, which originally developed to fight against tyranny and oppression, now itself became the biggest bearer of oppression and autocracy
 pun: bible janata ko sankatmukt karne ke liye aage ai
 This in itself is a contradiction
 jab carch apni aseem shakti ke kaaran maanya ho gaya tha or padariyon ne cross ko vismrit kar diya tathaa mahanth log anuchit laabh uthaane lage the janata bedaav hokar pun: ishwari vachanon ko foundne lagi
 Originally written in Hebrew and Arabshek, it was 400 AD Was translated into Latin by St
 Jerome C
 and this authentic translation was used by the Roman Catholic Church
 kintu latin sarvasaamaanya logon kii bhashaa na thi, duusare isai dharmaguru bhashaaon yaa foohad boliyon main hue bible ke anuwaadon se bahut chidhate the
 This was not only because the Christian leaders wanted to maintain their position of privilege, although there was an abundance of it, they were afraid that their words would not lose the power and intent of the divine words by being translated into the colloquial language
 keval ek chirparichit muhaavara poojya bhav or bhakthi ko uttejit karanevaala atyuttam madhyam nahin he athwa anivaary rup se gahan satyon kaa sarvopari sampreshak nahin he
 Somehow, due to the misconduct of the church, a new conflict started in religion and religious institution
 is avadhi main, saath hi saath bumadhyasaagar ke purvi taton par ek nai shakti kaa udai ho rahaa tha or islam ke umadte jowar ke purv anek isai mataavlambee pashchim kii ore bad chadh aae the
 Although the actual renaissance came decades later, these scholars and worshipers of Christianity were its precursors
 unhone logon ko anirdisht uttejnaaon se bhar diya
 "lollard" was the first to raise his voice in England
 yah ek sampradaay tha jo janata main isa messiah ke upadeshon kii shiksha detaa tha or carch tathaa math ke vichaar kaa virodh karata tha
 Their leader, Vikliffe was a man of amazing courage and erudition
 usne anubhav kiya ki vichaarparivartan ke liye logon ko isa ke upadeshvachanon kii jaankaree aavashyak he
 For this, translation of the Bible into the public language became necessary
 is prakaar us kaal kii naveen chetana vicliff kii aawaaj main dhvanit hui
 Wikliffe occurred at a time when English prose had little power to express the full opulence and beauty of the Bible
 iskaa apana anuwaad bahut hi ruksh he
 Perhaps he had no ear for English-speaking music
 ibrani padya kii kuch apni nijee visheshtaon ke kaaran uske mul sanskaran main ek aisi bhavyata bhi thi or prayog se kahin adhik mahatv hebrewwali bible ke shabdasaundarya kaa tha jo kuch pracheen anuwaadon main sahaj hi kho gaya tha
 Nouns have a special place in syntax, and the imperative of divisions today was not even there at that time, because it was a great real fantasy that the Jews had their own and their sensitiveness to words
 is prakaar kuch shabdon main hi samathrya or tivrata hoti thi kyonki ve shabd lagu na hokar beej rup main hote the
 Apart from this, the theme of ancient Dharmanium is widely accessible
 vishaywastu ke ruchikar hone or alp-samay-saadhy hone ke gunon ke kaaran isaki gaathaayen, varnan, natyagitiyaan bhavishyavaaniyan, sukhtiyaan, laghu kathaayen sabhi ne milakar ek savyav aakaar-prakaar dhaaran kar liya tha
 Finally, the New Testament contains the words of Jesus in the law
 at: unhen samajhane main thodi bhi chook athwa bhram ho jane par na keval uljhan hi bad jaati he balki sampurna aashay hi bhrasht ho jaataa he
 It is no wonder, therefore, that the churches did not consider the translations appropriate
 phir bhi wiliam tinden ne bible ke angreji anuwaad kaa pratham pramanik prayaas kiya
 He used the original Italian version which was prepared in Italy in the fifteenth century and also resorted to a Wikliffe translation made in the fourteenth century
 anuwaad ke liye usne saralatam angl shabdon ko chunaa or is prakaar jansadharan kii bhashaa se naikaty sthapit karte hue apana anuwaad prastut kiya 
 Tyndale also used Erasmus and the Zurich version of Luther and Zinggli
 phir bhi tindel kii sahajata kahin kahin atapate prayogon se sambhddha thi
 But it was only near Tyndale's Bible that Kaberdale was a great preacher
 vah tindel kii spashtataa ko nibaahane main safal hua he kintu usne use vaagmiyata se bhar diya he
 That is why he proves to be an extraordinary craftsman of prose
 kaverdell ke pashchaat san 1611 tak is disha main kai prayaas kiye gaye
 Seven years of tireless hard work produced the authentic version
 47 vidwaanon, vishpon ne lasalot andÃ¼ju kii adhyakshata main, westminster ke do vishvavidhyalayon main, is kaary ko teen khandon main puraa kiya
 Scholars wisely left Tyndale's clarity and Coverdale's lyrical eloquence to a large extent
 unhone anya anuwaadon se bhi sahaayta lee or is prakaar apane pramanik anuwaad ko ek suvyavasthit saundarya tathaa sangitatmak swar maadhuri pradaan kii jiskaa angreji bhashaa main dubaara paaya janaa sambhav nahin he
 Not only did it fill the Hebrew with its innate beauty and elemental power intact, but in proper terms, it acquired a "pictorial" and lyrical quality that was the result of excellent English talent
 yah janata kii boli main ghulmil gaya he
 Scholars say that his 93 à¤½ words are in English
 uskaa shabd kabhi bhi praapt yaa siikhaa hua nahin he tathaa anuwaad main gruhit shabd bilkul hi nahin he
 It was also necessary to clarify the intention as there should be no scope for rigor in the book, which is considered to be the book of God
 yadhyapi style bolchaal kii hi honi aavashyak thi taaki log samaj saken, tathaapi ganvaarupan ke liye bilkul hi sthaan na tha
 Then, it was also necessary to have simple words, and as such occasion beauty and restraint were also required
 pramanik anuwaad main in sabhi gunon kaa prachurya tha

 emperor penguin ke prajnan sthal ke faayde hai
 It is on hard ice, so there is no danger of the snow being so soft that it cannot support the herd or the chickens fall into the water before developing a waterproof cover
 yah 300 kimi prati ghante tak kii tej kii gati se bahane vaali barfili hawaaon se bache hue sangrakshit kshetra main he
 At the beginning of the Antarctic summer the breeding site is just a few meters from the water, where penguins can eat and drink
 lekin greeshm ke ant tak prajnan sthal pani or lepard sil jaise shikaariyon se se 100 kimi dur ho jaataa he
 Nevertheless, all penguins that can take part in the process of offspring try to reach their breeding sites, mostly on the move and sometimes plucking
 penguins gambhir kism ke ek patnik jeev hai matlab ek saal ke dauraan ek patnik
 yah vyavharik he - maadaa ekmaatr anda detii he or chuje ke bachane ke liye dono abhibhavakon kaa sahyog jaruri hota he
 After laying the egg, the female has to give it to the male without touching it from the ground
 yadi anda kuch pal bhi khule main rah jaae to bheeshan thand usko nasht kar degi
 The male has to take care of the egg so that the female can go back to the sea to eat and drink, and can also bring back additional food for her chick
 maadaa ne do maah se kuch khaaya nahin hota or jab tak wo santati sthal chhodti he apane bhaar kaa ek tihaai ganvaa chuki hoti he
 And for two months, the males are rounded together, raising their priceless eggs on the feet ; Do not let him fall even once
 is samay ye -62 degree celsius ke taapmaana kaa saamana karte hai or unke jal kaa ek maatr saadhan santati sthal par girane vaala paala hota he
 When the chickens come out, the male has very little food to feed them and if the females do not return soon, they have to leave their chickens and go to the sea to eat something themselves
 maadaaon ke lautne tak nar apane vajan ke aadhe rah jate hai or chaar maah se unhone kuch nahin khaaya hota
 The death of a chick is a very tragic event, but then its parents go back to the sea during the breeding season to search for food

 The process of using intense acid or mordant to harvest unprotected parts of a metal surface to form a design in a metal shape is called deposition
 As an intaglio method of producing prints, it is the most important technique for old master prints with cartography and is used extensively today
 shuddh rup se nakkashi main ek dhaatu ke plate ko ek mom kii sataha ke dhank diya jaataa he jo acid ke liye pratirodhi hota he
 The artist then scraps the surface with a pointed carving needle where he wants to get a line to show in the finished piece, from which the exposed metal emerges
 Echop, a device with an oblique oval section, is also used for "puffed" lines
 iske baad plate ko acid ke ek tub main dubaaya jaataa he jise takneekee taur par moredent yaa achent kaha jaataa he, yaa phir ise acid se dhoyaa jaataa he
 The acid "cuts" the exposed portion of the metal, and only the dipped lines remain in the plate
 iske baad shesh sataha ko plate se saafe kar liya jaataa he
 The entire plate is inked and after some time the ink is removed from the surface, thus leaving only ink in the carved lines
 iske baad plate ko paper kii ek shit ke saath ek hai-pressure printing press ke andar rakhaa jaataa he
 The paper absorbs the ink from the carved lines and a print is formed
 is prakriya ko kai baar doharaaya ja saktaa he, plate dwaara ghis jane kaa paryaapt sanket dene se pehle aam taur par kai sau chaape print kiye ja sakate hai
 The work done on the plate can also be added repeating the whole process; This creates an etching that exists in different conditions
 eaching ko aksar anya integleo takneekon ke saath shaamil kiya gaya he jaise ki engraving yaa equatint 
 Etching was practiced by goldsmiths and other metal workers in order of decoration in metal objects such as guns, armor, cups and plates from around the Middle Ages or even before
 vaise bhi germany main kavach kii alankrita sajaavat ek aisi kala thi jo sambhawatah 15veen sadi ke ant ke aas-paas - eaching ke ek print taiyaar karne vaali takanic ke rup main viksit hone se kuch samay pehle italy se laai gayi thi
 It is believed to have been invented by Daniel Hofer of Osburg, Germany, as a process used in preparing prints
 hoper ek shilpkaar the jinhone kavach ko is tareeke se alankrita kiya tha or lohe kii platon kaa upyog karte hue is vidhi kaa print taiyaar karne main prayog kiya tha 
 apane print ke alaava kavach par unki kalakriti ke do pramanit udhaaharan maujuud hai: 1536 kii ek dhaal jo ab madrid ke real armeria main maujuud he or ek talwaar jo neuramberg ke germanishes rashtriya sangrahalay main rakhi he
 The German Historical Museum, Berlin, has an Augsburg horse armor dated between 1512 and 1515 that has been embellished with Hofer's etchings and figures made of wood pieces but no evidence exists that Hofer himself Worked because their ornate prints were mostly drawn as patterns for other craftsmen in various media
 tambe ke platon ke liye switch sambhawatah italy main banaaya gaya tha or uske baad eaching jald hi print taiyaar karne vaale kalakaaron ke liye sabase adhik lokapriy madhyam ke rup main engraving ke saamne ek chunauti banakar aa gaya
 Its biggest advantage was that unlike engraving, which required special skills for metal carving, etching is a relatively easy-to-learn art for an artist trained in drawing
 loren main sthit nancy ke jaik calot ne eaching kii takanic main mahatvapurn takneekee pragati kii thi
 He developed a type of etching needle, the echop, with a slanted oval part at the end which helped to form a thick line for engravers that was possible for engravers
 aisa lagata he ki unhone mom aadhaarit formula kii bajaay been banane waalon ke varnish kaa istemaal karte hue eaching kii sataha ke liye ek sanshodhit, sakht, nuskhaa bhi taiyaar kiya tha
 This enabled the lines to be cut deeper which increased the lifespan of the printing as well as substantially reduced the risk of "mal-cutting" where the acid would reach the surface where it was not
 Should have reached, which could have created spots or grains on the picture
 pehle echar ke dimag main hameshaa kharaab-kataai kaa khatra maujuud rahata tha jisase vah ek single plate par bahut zyada samay nahin laga saktaa tha, kataai kii prakriya main yah khatra hameshaa ke liye dur ho gaya he
 Now Etcher can do a much more elaborate job that engravers previously had a monopoly and Calot made it possible to fully exploit new possibilities
 unhone pehle ke echron kii tulana main kai "stoppings-out" kaa vyapak or parishkrut upyog kiya
 It is a technique of lightly acid-cutting the entire plate, followed by a stop-out of the parts of the artwork that the artist wishes to keep in a light tone, covering with the ground before dipping it into acid again
 is prakriya ke saavdhaneepurvak niyantran se unhone duuri or lit evam shed ke prabhaav main abhootpurv sookshmata hasil kii
 unke zyaadaatar print apekshaakrit chote the - unke sabase lambey diemension main lagbhag chah inch yaa 15 semi tak, lekin vistaar ke saath pack
 One of his followers, Abraham Bose of Paris, spread Callot's inventions throughout Europe with Etching's first published manual which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English
 17veen sadi eaching kaa mahaan yug tha jisamen rembrant, giovani bennedato castiglione or kai anya maharathi kalakaar hue the
 Taipolo and Daniel Chodowiecki were the best of a small number of the finest achers in the 18th Piranesi
 19veen sadi or 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main eaching ke punaruddhar ne kuch kam kam mahatva ke kalakaaron ko utpann kiya lekin vastav main koi bada naam nahin shaamil tha
 Etching is still widely practiced today
 ek momyukt acid-pratirohak jise ek ground ke rup main janaa jaataa he, ise dhaatu ke ek plate par lagaaya jaataa he jo aksar tambe yaa jaste kaa hota he lekin steel plate vibhinn gunvatttaon ke saath ek anya madhyam he
 There are two common types of ground: hard ground and soft ground hard ground ko do tareekon se prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The solid hard ground comes in a hard waxed block
 is kism par hard ground kaa prayog karne ke liye nakkashi kii jane vaali plate ko ek garm plate par rakhaa jaataa he, jo ek tarah kii dhaatu kii kaam kii jane vaali sataha jise garm kiya jaataa he
 The plate is heated and the ground is applied by hand, melting on the plate
 ground ko jitna adhik samaan rup se sambhav ho roller ke jariye plate par failaayaa jaataa he
 Once applied, the etching plate is removed from the hot-plate and allowed to cool, which hardens the ground
 ground ke sakht ho jane ke baad kalakaar plate ko adarsh rup se teen madhumakhiyon ke mom vaale teparon se "phunkta" he jisase lau plate par laga kar ground ko kaala kar detii he or yah dekhnaa aasaan ho jaataa he kii plate kaa koun sa bhaag ujagar he
 Smoke not only makes the plate black but also a small amount of wax is added to it
 baad main kalakaar ek nukile upkaran kaa istemaal kar ground ko kharochtaa he or dhaatu ujagar ho jaati he
