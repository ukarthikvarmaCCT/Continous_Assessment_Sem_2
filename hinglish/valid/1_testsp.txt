 They wanted to find out what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end of the first film and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as a plot device

 In radio astronomy, a rapid radio explosion or FFRB is a very energetic astrophysical phenomenon arising from unknown causes in which a radio signal appears for a very narrow time
 yah ausatan kuch milisacond ke liye hi jari rahete hai or hamaari gallexi se baahar hi utpann hote hai
 The first rapid radio explosion was found in 2007 by Duncan Lorimer and David Narkevic in a study of signals from pulsars, which led to what is called the "lorimer explosion"

 Architecture has been and is a branch of fine arts, with the aim of taking the support of industrialization and constructing a good building in terms of utility, whose environment is highly cherished, cherished and cherished and cherished for the cultured and artistic interest

 Architectures are important in the history of a caste when civilization, prosperity and luxury come to them in some degree and they fully express the nature of caste pride, prestige, ambition and spirituality
 pracheen kaal main vaastukala sabhi kalaon kii janani kahi jaati thi
 But with the change of instinct and participation of allied businesses, it is no longer the seal of inclusive protection
 vaastukala puraatan kaal kii saamaajik sthiti prakaash main laanevaala mudranalay bhi kahi gai he
 This is as far as social and other achievements are concerned
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki vaastukala bhawanon ke alankaran ke atirikt or kuch nahin he
 This is partly true as far as historical architecture is concerned
 phir vaastukala sabhyataa kaa saanchaa bhi kahi gai he
 As far as the archaeological influence is concerned, it is fine, but with a brief look at the history of architecture, it will be clear that the earliest efforts of humans are seen as the habitat cave-habitats of the hunters, the tents of the shepherds and the huts of the peasants
 nauka-awaas or vrikshon par bani jhopadiyaan purakalin vishistataaen hai
 The earliest attempts to build a religious monument were in the form of stone and wooden fences
 in adikalin prayaason main or unke sudhare hue roopon main sabhi deshon main kuch na kuch baaten aisi mahatvapurn or vishisht prakaar kii hai ki bahut din baad kii mahanatam kala kritiyon main bhi ve pratyaksh hai
 In the rapid development of the ages, architecture evolved, molded and conformed to the changing needs of humans - its security, work, religion, pleasure and other epoch-making symbols
 misr ke sade swaroop, china ke maanak abhikalp-swaroop, bharat ke videshi tathaa samrudh swaroop, mexico ke may or astek kii angadh mahima, yunaan ke atyant viksit devaytan, roman samrajya kii bahuvidh aavashyaktaaon kii purti karanevaale jatil prakaar ke bhawan, purakalin aadambaraheen giraje, mahan gothic girizaa bhawan or chitropam durg, turki imaaraton ke utkrisht vinyas evam anupaat or europea punarutthan ke bhavy vaastukiy smarak aitihaasik vaastu ke satat vikaas kaa lekha prastut karte hai
 All these buildings point to great epochs of human development, in which architecture is highly related to the ethnic life, reflecting the talent and ambition of the castes who have a clear imprint on their monuments
 prayek aitihaasik vaastu kii uplabdhiyaan mote taur se do moolbhoot siddhanton se nishchit kii ja sakati hai, ek jo sankalpana main antarnihit he or doosraa jo sarvocch vishistataa kaa dyotak he
 In Egyptian Vastu it is the mystification expressed by huge and massive monuments, in Assyrian, Babylonian and Iranian art, it was armament and luxurious life, in Greek art it was decidedly planned and modified vision which resulted in simplicity and refined perfection
 romanon main yah bhavyata, anand evam shakti kaa prem tha jiske falswaroop vilakshan vaigyanik nirmaan hua
 Among the ancient Christians, this was in the form of a great zeal for the construction of churches that expressed the true simplicity and pride of Jesus Christ; Amongst Gothic makers, this structure was an ardent force with knowledge of mechanics; In the Italian revival it was the scholar of that era
 buddha or hindu vaastukala kaa utkrisht gun uskaa aadhyatmik tatv he, ja uske vikaas main adyopant pratyaksh he
 His dominance over unimaginable wealth, wealth and vast plots in Muslim architecture reflects; Whereas the great Afghani Vastu of India reveals the aggressive tendency of that regime; But the Mughal monuments are excellent in showing the excellent proportions of the Mughals and the love of work and express their life in the warmth of India
 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background
 aaj bhi ham pratibhavan vyaktiyon ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt swaroop tatolte rahete hai
 Today, there are some people who are satisfied to follow the ghost, there are others who try to emulate the foreign way
 bahut thode se aise hai jo apane samay, gati or rashtriya drushtikaan ke anuroop vaastu kaa vikaas karte kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The effort of this small class is to present a new impact, which inspires the human to think and hold new ideas
 is prakaar se hamaare yug ke bhawan nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai or baad main ye hi bhawan sharir or mastishk ke swasth vikaas ko protsaahat karke jati kaa nirmaan karenge
 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama
 There is no doubt that buildings are the basis of architecture, but apart from erecting these buildings there is something else like poetry prose is something other than composition
 mithe swar main gaae jane par kavita prabhaavshaalee hoti hi he, kintu jab uske saath upyukt sangeet or layayukt nrity cheshtaayen bhi hoti hai tab vah keval manushya ke hriday kii or vibhinn indriyon ko hi aakarshith nahin karti apitu inke gauravpurn mail se nirmit saare vaataavaran se hi use avgat karaati he
 Likewise, archetypes are replete with philosophical activities, poetic expressions and inclusive lyrical, musical and descriptive meanings, and such exquisite artefacts deserve to be admired by the human in all respects and then gain worldwide fame
 sarvasammat mahan vaastukritiyon kii yah prashasti chirsthayee hoti he or bhavi pidiyon ko prerana detii he
 It is true that there has been a lot of instability in the use of architecture, revealing numberless styles
 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose to the styles, such as the changing fashion has no relation to a woman's dress
 is vishay main frankllid rhite ne kaha he ki vaastukala kii paridhi idhar udhar hatati rahati he, uskaa centre nahin badalata
 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he
 If seen in this context, architecture should be a complete and well-developed creation of one's own initiating mind, which reaches a higher level of self

 It is also called the 'newton-rapson method'
 ek char vaale falnon ke liye is vidhi kaa varnan is prakaar he: Suppose the function ƒ and its derivative ƒ ′, for the real x, is given
 falan f kaa mul nikaalane ke liye sabase pehle mul kaa pratham anumaan x0 lekar yah vidhi shuru hotihai
 Now x1 is derived from the following formula to give a more accurate value of the original: isi prakriya ko baar-baar doharaaya jaataa he jab tak mul kaa paryaapt rup se yatharth maan na praapt ho jaay
 This method can be understood geometrically by the following moving diagram: newton kii vidhi atyant shaktishaalee takanic he
 Its convergence is quadratic
 kintu is vidhi kii kuch samasyaayen bhi hai- This example has been resorted to to understand the working of this method
 mana sameekaran cos ⁡ = x 3 { \ displaystyle \ cos=x^{3}} kaa ek dhanatmak mul nikaalnaa he
 Now let's change the form of this equation as follows: chunki x ke sabhi maanon ke liye cos ⁡ ⩽ 1 { \ displaystyle \ cos \ leqslant 1} tathaa x>1 ke liye x3>1 atah is sameekaran kaa mul 0 or 1 ke bich hoga
 Let the original x 0 = 0, 5 { \ displaystyle x_ {0} = 0,5}
 is mul ke pratham 7 ank vaastavik mul ke pratham 7 ankon ke baraabar hai
 If no more than this is required, then by taking the same value of the original one can finish the calculation

 There are many departments on the commercial side of this craft and there are less craftsmen who are aware of other departments besides their department
 at: sahaj kalatmak preranaayen vyarth jaati hai
 This does not mean that offset lithography lacks aesthetics, but it is a matter of assuming that the aesthetic is progressively secondary, especially in the event that photography is replacing swolithopy
 litho chapai kaa aarambh pathar se chhapane ke rup main hua or aaj bhi uskaa mahatv kam nahin hua he, parantu photographset ko, jo chapai kaa paroksh prakram he or jisamen shighrata, sastaapan or yatharthata ke liye chapai ke kaam main prakaashayantric vidhiyon kaa upyog hota he, tyaagaa nahin ja saktaa

 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the German people are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race

 main hind-arya janajatiyon ne europe se aakar sindhu-ghati main akraman kiya or bharat kii deshi sindhu ghati sabhyataa ko ujaad diya or uske nivaasiyon kaa narsanhaar kiya or baad main bache-khuche logon ko das bana liya -- jinako rugveda main das or dasyu kaha gaya he 
 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians
 madhya asia ke "kurgan kabr-tile" pracheen aaryon dwaara banaaye gayi maane jate hai
 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia
 is baat ko kai bhartiya or hindutv-vaadi maanate hai, par baaki duniya main is drushtikon kii koi kadra nahin he
 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture
 vaise bhi bhartiya jalwaayu or pashu-pakshiyon ke shabdon ke liye unani, latin, german or anya hind-europea bhashaaon main milte julate shabd nahin milte, jaise mor, murga, baagh, hathi, aam, kelaa, pipal, bargad, neem, garm-mausam, ganda, bhens, chaaval, ityadi

 indicate that its inhabitants were not Aryans

 To this end, they have used a unique method of writing numbers by Akshara in a nutshell, in which numbers were used to indicate simple numbers and vowels counted zero
 udhaahrant: In Q3 = 43,20,000 k is written for 2 and y for 30
 donon akshar milakar likhe gaye hai or unamem u kii maatra lagi he, jo 10,000 ke samaan he; isliye khyu kaa arth hua 3,20,000; ghri ke gh kaa arth he 4 or ri kaa 10,00,000, isliye ghri kaa arth hua 40,00,000
 is tarah khyughri kaa uparyukt maan hua
 The biggest flaw in this method of writing numbers is that if the letters are manipulated a little, then a big mistake can be made
 doosraa dosha yah he ki l main ri kii maatra lagaai jaay to iskaa rup vahi hota he jo lri swar kaa, parantu donon ke arthon main bada antar padataa he

 chunki gopichand kaa sambandh bengal ke paalvansh se tha, isliye is gaatha kaa sabase adhik prachlan bengal main he
 This folklore is also found in Bhojpuri, Magahi, Maithili, Punjabi, Sindhi etc
 raja bharthri bhi nathpanthi the
 He is also named among the nine Naths
 raja bharthri or rani samdei kaa vrittant hi is lokgatha kaa varnya vishay he
 It is often sung by Jogi people
 raja bharthri kaa sambandh ujjain ke rajvansh se tha
 Later, for some reasons, he accepted the discipleship of Guru Gorakhnath and left his young queen and became a yogi
 inke kai granth bhi milte hai
 It is believed that he was the elder brother of King Vikramaditya and nephew of King Gopichand
 dhyanpurvak dekhne se spasht prathit hota he ki sabhi deshon kii lokgaathaon kii visheshtaayen praaia: samaan hai
 These characteristics of folklore often separate them from ornate poetry
 mukhya visheshtaayen hai - The most notable feature of folklore is that its authors are unknown
 aisa prathit hota he ki inke rachayita laaparvaah the or lambii lokkathaon kii rachana ke baad apana naam dena bhul jate the
 This is the reason why people do not know when they add their created posts to the folklore that has been passed on from the tradition
 in lokgaathaon main tatkaaleen saamaajik sthiti kii jhalak milti hai
 Lack of authentic text of folklore is found
 rachayita ke agyaat hone ke kaaran yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 Once the creators of the received folklore, after introducing the folklore and handing it to the society, they themselves go away, and after that a continuous stream of folklore begins to flow which never ends
 lokgaathaon ko prayek yug apni nijee sampatti samajhataa he or prayek gavaiya apni icchaanusaar kuch panktiyaan bhi jod detaa he
 As these folk songs go from one singer to another, these changes happen
 is prakaar in ke pramanik paath kaa milanaa nitant asambhav ho gaya he
 The condition of music is mandatory in folklore
 chunki inamen sookshm bhaavon kii vyanjana nahin pai jaati, isliye inamen saahitiyikta kaa abhaav hota he
 Although the incorporation of dance was compulsory in ancient Indian folklore, it gradually became secondary and is not visible today
 lokkathaayen chaahe jahaan kii bhi hon, sthaan vishesh par pahunchakar vahaan kii visheshtaayen apana leti hai
 Their construction is often due to some event and it incorporates the objective environment and localism
 'loriki' main vihaar ke kai gaanvon kaa spasht varnan miltaa he
 Camel has special significance in the folklore of 'dholamaru', because there is only a camel there
 parvatiy anchalon main chunki sardi adhik padati he atev vahaan kii balaaye apane pita se kahati hai ki meraa byaah aisi jagah mat kijiega jahaan garmi adhik padati ho or paseene se pareshaan ho jaaon
 The local practices are found in Maithili folklore
 bharat main maukhik parampara pracheen kaal se hi chali aa rahi he
 Vedas literature also continued through this tradition through Guru disciples and was later scripted
 lokgathaayen lipibaddh nahin hoti thim; apitu maukhik parampara ke rup main hi chali aa rahi hai
 In fact, their importance is also only when they are not scripted
 lipibaddh hone ke pashchaat inkaa vistaar ruk jaataa he tathaa inaki swaabhaaviktaa nasht ho jaati he
 The reason is that as long as they remain in the oral tradition, then the material of the folk remains but when it is written, then it becomes the property of literature
 lokgathaayen hriday kaa dhan hoti hai
 In it, melody and naturalness comes on its own
 inamen alankrita style ke abhaav kaa kaaran yah he ki yah kisi vyaktivishesh kii sampatti na hokar sampurna samaaj kii sampatti hoti hai
 Since their origin is from ancient times and the ornate form was not developed at that time, the lack of ornate style is natural
 lokgaathaon main upadeshaatmak pravriti kaa nitant abhaav paaya jaataa he
 Their aim is usually to present a complete picture of folk life
 lokgaathaon kaa gayan maatr hi gayakon kaa kaary hota he
 Getting something from it is the task of the audience
 lokgaathaon main lekhak ke vyaktitv kaa purna abhaav paaya jaataa he
 Since the author of these gathas cannot be said with certainty that he is a particular person, his personality also does not affect the society
 inamen keval vishay kii pradhanta hoti he, lekhak ke vyaktitv kaa astitv nahin hota
 The plot of these stories is very detailed
 chunki kathatmak geeton ko hi lokgatha kehete hai isliye swabhaavat: katha ke vistaar ke saath hi gaatha kaa vistaar bhi bad jaataa he
 The other reason for its expansion may be that society considers it to be its property and arbitrarily all add something to it
 chunki lokgaathaon kaa uddeshy keval katha kahana hota he isliye ye ativ lambii ho jaati hai
 a notable feature of folklore is the repetition of its take positions
 gaatha ko aanandadaayak tathaa prabhavotpadak banane ke liye geeton ko baraabar duharaakar gane kaa prachlan paaya jaataa he
 Their tendency suggests that these gathas were sung collectively
 is pravriti se kuch laabh bhi hai
 When the two classes gather for singing the saga, the atmosphere is revived by the repetition of take positions and the other group also gets bored
 is pravriti se shrotaaon ko bhi anand kii anubhuti hoti he or gayak bhi raahat tathaa utsaah anubhav karte hai
 These folklore do not have historicity, and if they have found historical basis in some way, then it is doubtful
 'aalha', 'raja gopichand', 'raja bharthri' 'babu kunwar singh' ityadi lokgaathaon kaa itihaas se kuch samarthan miltaa he par kuch kaa koi sutara nahin miltaa
 For example, 'shobhanayak, Banjara', 'loriki' Sorathi etc
 do not find any description in history
 khaadi or gramodyog ayog, sansad ke 'khaadi evam gramodyog ayog adhinium 1956' ke tahat bharat sarkaar dwaara nirmit ek vaidhanik nikaay he
 It is an apex institution under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Industries related to Khadi and Village Industries in India, with the main objective - "planning, publicity, facilities for the establishment and development of Khadi and Village Industries in rural areas"
 And to provide assistance, in which it can also take the help of other agencies working in the field of rural development as required
 "

 "the dress of freedom" - Mahatma Gandhi khaadi, haath se kaate gaye or bune gaye kapade ko kehete hai
 Cotton, silk, or wool can be used as raw materials, which are threaded on a spinning wheel
 khaadi kaa 1920 main mahatma gandhi ke swadeshi aandolan main ek rajnatik hathiyaar ke rup main upyog kiya gaya tha
 Khadi is sourced from various parts of India on the basis of raw materials - silk goods are obtained from West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and North Eastern states, while cotton is obtained from Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal

 audyogikaran ke maddenzar or lagbhag sabhi prakriyaaon kaa mashinikaran hone ke kaaran bharat jaise shram adhishesh desh ke liye khaadi or gramodyog kii mahatta or adhik bad jaati he
 Another advantage of Khadi and rural industry is that there is no need for capital to set them up, which makes them an economically viable option for the rural poor

 The Commission has three major objectives that direct its functions
 ye is prakaar hai - The Commission seeks to achieve these objectives by implementing and controlling various schemes and programs
 yojanaon or kaaryakramon ke kriyanvayan kii prakriya sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyog mantralay se armbh hoti he, jo in kaaryakramon kaa prashasnic pramukh hota he
 The Ministry receives funds from the Indian Central Government and reaches the Khadi and Village Industries Commission for the implementation of programs and schemes related to Khadi and Village Industries
 khaadi or gramodyog ayog iske baad is dhankosh kaa prayog apane kaaryakramon kaa karyanvayan karne ke liye karata he
 The Commission will invest this work directly through its 29 state offices by investing directly in Khadi and village institutions and cooperative institutions; Or indirectly through 33 Khadi and Village Industries Boards, which are statutory bodies formed by the State Governments in India for the purpose of promoting Khadi and Village Industries in the State concerned
 tatpashchaat, khaadi or gramodyog board khaadi or gram sansthaanon / sahakaaritaaon / vyavsaaiyon ko dhan muhaiyaa karaate hai
 Currently, the developmental programs of the Commission are being implemented through 5600 registered institutions, 30,138 cooperative institutions and about 94
85 lakh people

 Under this scheme, the bank provides loan to the members to meet their functional / fixed amount requirements
 ye rin 4% prativarsh kii riyayati byaaj dar par uplabdh karaaye jate hai
 The difference between the real interest rate and the concessional rate is borne by the Commission under the 'grant' item of its budget

 The government provides discounts on the sale of Khadi and Khadi products to keep their prices cheaper than other clothes

 The rebate is given only on the sales done by the institutions / centers operated by the Commission / State Board as well as the sales centers run by the registered entities engaged in the manufacture of Khadi and Polyvastra
 haal hi main, vitt mantralay ne sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyog mantralay se khaadi or gramodyog ke liye apni chhot yojanaon ko punah banane ke liye kaha he
 His view is that "the Ministry should go before the Planning Commission instead of trying to increase the scheme from year to year
 Further, it has asked the Ministry of MSME to reconstruct the scheme in such a way that it will sell to the vendor
" Instead of benefiting the artisans "
 In this regard, a proposal of the Commission to initiate market development cooperation as a possible alternative to rebate on sales is under consideration by the Government of India
