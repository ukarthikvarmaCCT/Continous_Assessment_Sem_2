 At the present time, mainstream economists generally believe that deflation is a problem in the modern economy due to the risk of deflationary complications
 apsfiti ko aarthik mandi or vishwavyaapee mandi se bhi joda jaataa he, jaise ki bank jamakartaon kii adaayagi main chook jate hai
 In addition, deflation in the stabilization of the economy hinders monetary policy formulation under a process known as the liquidity trap
 haalanki, aitihaasik rup se apsfiti kii sabhi ghatnaayen, kamjor aarthik vikaas ke daure se judi nahin hai
 The term deflation was used by traditional economists in an alternative sense to refer to the decline in money supply and debt; Some economists, including economists of Austrian ideology, still use the term in the same sense
 ye dono arth ek duusare ke saath sambandhit hai, kyonki mudra kii aapurti saamaanya mulya str main giravat kaa sambhavit kaaran ban jaati he
 In the IS / LM model, deflation occurs due to changes in the supply and demand curve line for goods and interest, especially the overall drop in demand levels
 arthath puri arthvyavastha main kitna kray karne kii ichha main kitni giravat ai he or maal kii keemton main kitni vruddhi hone ja rahi he
 Due to falling commodity prices, consumers are encouraged to delay purchases until prices fall further, in turn reducing overall economic activity by deflationary rotation

 Inflation has the opposite effect and thus there is already a business slowdown

 In the economic outlook of recent times, deflation is associated with risk: where risk-adjusted returns on assets go down and turn negative, investors and purchasers will raise money and deposit instead of investing in even the most solid securities

 a central bank cannot generally hold negative interest for the currency and even the effect of zero interest often produces less encouraging effects than slightly higher interest rates

 In Monetarist theory, deflation is related to a constantly decreasing currency velocity or number of transactions
 iske liye mudra kii aapurti ke naatakeey sankuchan ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he, shaayad ghatati hui vinimay dar ke pratyuttar main, athwa swarnamaanak yaa anya bahya maudrik aadharbhoot aavashyaktaaon ke pratyuttar main
 Deflation is generally considered negative, as it leads to the transfer of assets from borrowers and holders of denominated assets, thereby benefiting the accumulators and holders of currency and equitable assets

 Since deflation discourages investment, as there is no consistent reason to risk future gains while profit expectation is negative and future prices are lower than expected, this is often the reason for sudden demand in aggregate demand

 However, deflation is a natural condition in a rare currency economy when the rate of increase in the supply of money is kept in line with the rate of positive population growth
 jab aisa ghatata he, tab prati vyakti par durlabh mudra kii uplabdh raashi ghat jaati he, natijatan mudra or bhi dushprapya ho jaati he; or is kaaran mudra kii prayek ikai kii kray karne kii kshamta bad jaati he
 The last part of the 19th century provides an example of continuous developmental deflation along with economic growth under these circumstances
 jab utpaadan kii kshamta main sudhaar ke samano kii kul keemat main kami paidaa kar detaa he tab bhi apsfiti ghatit hoti he
 The reason for the improvement in production efficiency is usually that economic producers of goods and services are motivated by the promise of increasing profit margins as a result of improvement in production

 When an increase in one's purchasing power of a currency seems beneficial, it can actually create difficulties when a large portion of one's net worth is invested in economical assets such as houses, land and other forms of private property

 Consequently, deflation can also be considered as an amplification of the shadow of a loan interest rate
 agar sanyukt rajya america kii bhayaavah mandi ke dauraan, apsfiti kaa ausat 10% prativarsh ho jaataa he, to 0% par rin bhi ankarshak ho jaataa he kyonki ise 10% ke adhik laagat mulya par prativarsh chukaaya janaa aavashyak ho jaataa he

 When the short-term interest rate reaches zero, central banks can no longer bring flexibility in their policy by lowering their normal interest rate

 The current president of the United States Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said in 2002, "substantial injections of currency will ultimately always produce the opposite deflation

 This theory has been criticized by some economists, who believe that if there are no strictures, neither inflation nor deflation will have a significant effect
 chunki apsfiti kii avadhiyaan unka samarthan karti hai, jo unke liye mudra dhaaran karte hai jinke paas mudra he hi nahin, tulana aksar badhati hui loklubhaav bhaavana kii samyaavadhiyon se kii jaati he, kyonki 19veen sadi ke ant tak sanyukt rajya america ke janavaadiyon ne durlabh mudra ke maanakon par aadhaarit adhik sphitikaarak chaandi ke dhaatu kii mudraon main karnaa chaha
 The deflationary cycle is a stage when a fall in prices reduces the product, which in turn also reduces wages and demand, leading to a further decline in price

 Some people consider the deflationary cycle to be the cause of the Great Recession
 apsfitikar chakra sachmuch hi vivaadaaspad rup se ghatit hote hai
 The deflationary cycle is the modern version of macroeconomics derived from the bulk of the 19th-century controversies common disputes
 isse sambandhit duusari vichaardhaara irving fisher kaa siddhant he ki atyaadhik rin anwarat apsfiti kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 If excessive inflation destroys the currency, people will move to save their savings in other currencies without delay, which will cause deflation in those other currencies as well
 Alternatively, if policies that bring in high inflation are suddenly reversed, deflation may occur for a short time because by then people will have developed faith in that currency

 Historical cases of deflation have often been related to an increased supply of goods without an increase in the supply of money, or a combination of a decrease in the supply of money with a drop in demand for goods
 mahaan mandi par ben barnanke dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan se yah sanket mila he ki, ghatati hui maang kii main pratikriya main, us vakt fedral reserve ne mudra kii aapurti kam kar di, atah isane apsfiti laane main sahyog pradaan kiya
 Four distinctions of deflation have been described
 do maang ke paksh main hai or do aapurti ke paksh main: In a monetaryist perspective, deflation mainly comes from a decrease in currency velocity and / or the amount of money is determined by the supply of money per capita

 In a debt-dependent economy, the decline in the money supply significantly reduces lending, leading to a rapid decline in the money supply, and also a subsequent demand
 maang main giravat aati he or maang kii giravat ke saath-saath, keemten ghat jaati hai kyonki aapurti kii prachurtaa viksit hoti he
 When deflation costs fall below the cost of production, this deflation becomes high

 Since mortgage lending banks have received assets whose value has fallen dramatically since mortgage lending and even if they sell those assets, they further hamper the re-supply, Which only spoil the situation

 In a volatile currency economy, barter and other alternative currency regimes such as dollarisation are common and that is why commerce can continue even when the government currency depreciates
 Since the central government is often incapable in such an economy and even if it wants to control the internal economy in a sufficient manner, there is a great need for the common people to get government money in addition to paying the imported goods

 Some economists argue that the economic recession after 2000 years was undergoing a period of time when the United States was at risk of severe deflation and that is why the Federal Reserve has been "moderate" since 2001 by the Central Bank on interest rates
 "it was right to be controlled with stance

 With the rise of currencyist ideas, the focus was on disseminating demand by reducing interest rates to fight deflation
 This thinking suffered a setback in view of the failure of liberal policies to stimulate demand in both Japan and the United States when the stock market suffered a setback in the early decades of 1990 and between 2000–2002

 This was because the huge contraction of debt led to bankruptcies creating an ambulatory demand for cash and the Federal Reserve was not able to adequately meet this demand, hence the bank collapsed one by one
 Started happening
 From the point of view of the Fisher equation, the supply of money and the currency velocity that was so deep that price deflation began despite the increase in the money supply stimulated by the Federal Reserve when both had concomitant discounts

 Once she meets, if the employer asks her to sign up for 1 lakh rupees if a bond continues in employment, then the court effect could be seen as an unfair one after the employee is past her job and she resigns There is no other option but to agree to the terms and conditions of the employer
 So a lot of these things depends on the circumstances of the case and the facts
 ek rojgaar anubandh yaa nahin he kii tarah ek maanak anubandh he, jahaan prastaav karmchaaree saktaa he yaa to sweekaar karte hai
 Unless an employee proves that the employment bond is obtained without his free consent, the conditions provided by the bond can be enforced and are not contrary to the proper public policy
 Whether the law is fair depends on the ability of lawyers to argue another case

 The case of compensation for breach of contract is one of every act to be dealt with on an s basis of 73 years
 74 a special case where the contract for payment of an amount of money on breach of contract includes any other condition for the contract itself or the penalty shall also be applied in addition to the principle propounded by s and that even if why The amount of the stipulated in the contract, the aggrieved party entitled to in the contract only fixed reasonable compensation to which would be, but not exceeding such amount
 No one is involved in a contract regardless of whether the clause is a contract
 It has been decided which one is whether the sum or the money is being paid as a breach of contract, the party complaining of the breach of contract damages
 Can not successfully claim compensation unless it makes out of damages to be referable like breach
 Proper compensation would be the best measure of the extent to which the damage or loss of continuous course is actual
 If the actual extent of the loss or damage is sustained, reasonable compensation is being able to determine the amount of proved that the Court provides a safe guidance for
 agar nuksaan yaa maatra kaa tehraav kii haani sambhav nahin he, party he jo ulanghan ke kaaran kaa saamana karnaa padaa upaay bina nahin he
 He can still request the court to assess the appropriate compensation for the award itself and on the material available
 The words in S
 74 emphasize that in a case where the actual loss or proof of limitation is incapable or not 'loss or damage to prove whether or not the actual cause has been caused' is also taxed for employment Can be given reasonable compensation
 This is the reason why s 74 of the Act is said to have been deliberately awarded to be properly compensated
 nuksaan main ek maamle main jahaan ke ulanghan kii shikaayat party yaa haani kii bhaavana banaae rakhane kii chot main kanoonee anubandh he nahin padaa he, vahaan ke liye use kuch bhi nahin he kshatipurti karne ke liye, vahaan sudhaar karnaa he kuch bhi nahin badla he, yaa santusht
 isliye, vah muaavje ke hakdaar hone ke liye nahin kiya jayega
 By reading the sections mentioned above it is very clear that the employer assumes that if a bond ends on an agreement with the employer before the term of an employee is specified and there is an amount to be paid to determine the contract
 For, the employer can sue for breach, ask for employee contract and set the amount
 agar nirdhaarit raashi sampada he ek anumaan ke-vaastavik purv haani to kaha jaataa he ise nasht harjaana lekin agar main nirdisht raashi rojgaar anubandh kii tarah he ek khatre ke pradarshan karne ke liye majaboor kiya jahaan karmchaaree anubandh he, to yah ek dand 
 If the court finds that this award is a penalty then it will only be an amount which will suffer the employer to compensate the real loss
 For example if it is paid a contract specifying an amount of 1 crore of employment, if it is cross, then the court will consider it as a penalty and will only award the actual loss that costs training employer

 Spectrometry is a branch of physics in which the spectrum of electromagnetic radiations emitted or absorbed by matter is studied and from this study knowledge of the intrinsic composition of substances is obtained
 is shakha main mukhya rup se varnakram kaa hi adhyayan hota he at: ise spectrumiki yaa spectrumvigyaan kehete hai
 Originally, the study of the interaction between radiation and matter was called spectroscopy or spectroscopy
 vastut: aitihaasik rup se drushya prakaash kaa kisi prism se guzarane par alag-alag aavritiyon kaa alag-alag raste par janaa hi spectroscopy kehalaata tha
 The meaning of the term 'spectroscopy' later expanded
 ab tarangadairdhya ke falan ke rup main kisi bhi raashi kaa maapan spectroscopy kehalaati he
 Its definition was further expanded when energy was included as a variable amount kisi raashi kaa aavriti ke falan ke rup main aalekh varnakram kehalaata he
 The measurement of the density of the presence of ions, atoms or molecules in a mass of a substance is called spectrometry
 jo upkaran spectrometry main sahaayak hote hai ve spectrometer, spectrophotometer yaa spectrograph aadi naamon se jane jate hai
 Spectroscopy / spectrometry is often used in physical and analytical chemistry
 iskaa upyog khagol vigyaan evam sudur samvedan main bhi hota he
 The foundations of spectroscopy were laid by Isaac Newton in 1666 AD
 unhone ek band kamare main khidki ke chhidr se aate hue saura kiranpunj ko ek prism se hokar parde par jane diya
 Seven colors on the curtain were purple
 pattee main saato rang - laal, naarangi, pilaa, haraa, aasamaani, nila or bangnee - isi kram main dikhaai padate the
 Newton called this strip "spectrum"
 is prayog se unhone yah siddh kiya ki surya kaa shwet prakaash vastav main saat rangon kaa mishran he
 For a long time, "spectrum" was used to refer to this color band
 baad main vaigyanikon ne yah dekha ki saura spectrum ke bangnee rang se neeche bhi kuch rashmiyaan pai jaati hai jo aankh se nahin dikhaai padati hai parantu photoplate par prabhaav daalati hai or unka photo liya ja saktaa he
 These rays are called ultraviolet rays
 isi prakaar laal rang se upar avarakt kirane pai jaati hai
 Actually, the colors of all the characters are electromagnetic waves
 rangeen prakaash, avarakt, parabangnee prakaash, eks-kiran, gamma-kiran, micro tarangen tathaa radio tarangen - ye sabhi vidyucchumbakeey tarangen hai
 They all have a spectrum
 paare ko uttejit karne se jo hare rang kii kirane nikalati hai unka tarangadairghy 5461 angsterom hota he
 So now the colors of different colors are divided not on the basis of color but on the wavelength and the meaning of spectrum has become very broad - the arrangement of the colors according to the wavelength is called spectrum
 spectrumvigyaan kaa sambandh praaia: sabhi prakaar kii vidyucchumbakeey tarangon se he
 Microwave spectrum spectroscopy, infrared-spectroscopy, field of view spectroscopy, X-ray spectrometry and nuclear-spectroscopy are all part of spectroscopy, but in the prevailing sense, spectroscopy includes the study of spectrum of infrared, visible and ultraviolet rays
 newton ne surya kii kirnon se jo "spectrum" praapt kiya tha vah shuddh nahin tha arthath sabhi rang pasavaale rang se purnat: pruthak nahin the; ek rang duusare se mila tha
 The reason for this was that they poured rays from a round hole to the prism
 san 1802 i
 main volaston ne gol chhidr ke sthaan par sankri jhirri kaa prayog karke shuddh spectrum praapt kiya
 Later on, Joseph Fraunhofer obtained a pure spectrum with the help of prism and invented plane grating
 grating ek doosraa upkaran he jo vibhinn varna kii rashmiyon ko parikshepit kar detaa he
 The work of Fraunhofer assumes special significance in the advancement of spectroscopy
 san 1859 i
 main kirkhaaf or bunshan ne bahut se shuddh tattvon kaa spectrum liya or yah bataaya ki ve ek duusare se sarvatha bhinn hote hai
 Kirkhoff and Bunshan also proved that a substance whose properties can give when stirred, can give only the colors of the same character at low temperatures, but can also absorb only the colors of the same character at low temperatures
 in tatwon kii jaankaree ke baad spectrumiki kii pragati badi tivrata se hui
 This science has contributed immensely in acquiring knowledge of the formation of atomic molecules
 kisi padaarth ko vidyut yaa ooshmaa dekar uttejit kiya jaataa he tab usase prakaash nikalne lagata he
 The spectrum of rocks released from that substance depends on its internal structure
 kisi thos padaarth ko itnaa garam kiya jaae ki vah teevr chamak dene lage to usase jo spectrum praapt hota he use satat spectrum kehete hai kyonki isamen vibhinn varna kii pattiyaan ek duusari se mili juli rahati hai, unki koi seemaa nahin pai jaati he
 Similar spectrum is obtained from electric bulb and sun
 iske vipareet yadi kisi padaarth ko itani adhik urja di jaae ki use parmaanu uttejit ho jaaen to usase rekhiy spectrum miltaa he
 There are sharp lines of different colors in it
 vidyut arq tathaa kuch taron se bhi rekhiy spectrum praapt hota he
 There is also a third category of spectrum
 yadi kisi gas main kam dabaav par vidyut visarjan kiya jaae to ve gaisen uttejit hokar sapatt spectrum detii hai
 In this spectrum, several plates are found apart from each other, one end of which is sharp and the other is tarnished respectively
 ye sabhi spectrum utsarjit spectrum kahe jate hai
 If all the colors of the letter are sent from within a substance, it absorbs those quantities which it can emit itself
 bijli ke balve se drishyakshetra kii sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan nikalati hai
 If there is a steam of sodium in a tube and by sending the light of the bulb from within it, the spectrum of outward light is taken, then two black lines are found in its yellow part
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki sodium swayan uttejit hone par rekhiy spectrum detaa he
 There are also two yellow lines in this spectrum called the "D" lines of sodium
 jab balb kaa prakaash sodium kii bhaap se hokar jaataa he to sodium di rekhaon ke anukool varna ko avashoshit kar letaa he or barhigat prakaash main isi sthaan par do kaali rekhaayen ban jaati hai
 This spectrum is called the absorption spectrum
 avasorana spectrum bhi teen prakaar ke hote hai
 The absorption spectrum in which the black lines are found is called the linear absorption spectrum, in which the black bands are found, the band absorption spectrum and in which only a slightly more continuous region of the spectrum is absorbed is called the continuous absorption spectrum
 spectrum praapt karne ke liye jin upkarnon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he unhen spectrumdarshi, spectrummapi or spectrumlekhi kehete hai
 Each spectrographic spectroscope has three main components
 pehla bhaag strot se aanevaali rashmiyon ko uchit disha main niyantrit karata he, doosraa bhaag vibhinn varnon ko pruthak karata arthath mishrit rashmiyon ko parikshepit karata he tathaa teesraa bhaag unhen alag alag ek nabhital par focus karata he
 If the device only has a system of viewing the spectrum, then it is called a spectroscope, if there is also a system of reading the deviation of different characters of the spectrum by rotating its third part, then it is called a spectrometer, from which a permanent picture of the spectrum can be taken
 sabhi spectrolekhi banaavat main lagbhag samaan hote hai kintu parikshepan ke liye do saadhan kaam main laae jate hai - prism or grating
 Hence spectrographs are also of two types - prism spectrograph and grating spectrograph
 adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye spectrum ko vibhinn kshetron main baant liya gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of three things - Rashmisrot, reflection method and recording
 spectrumiki vibhaag main nimnaankit kshetron kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he - sudur avaraktakiran drishyakshetra, parabangnee kshetra or nirvaat parabangnee kshetra
 Different types of spectrography are used in different parts
 sarini main vibhinn kshetron kii seemaa, parikshepan yantra or abhilekhan yantron kaa sankshipt vivaran diya gaya he- There are three types of spectrum - linear, banded and continuous
 rekhiy spectrum main kel rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 In the banded spectrum, band bands are found, one edge of which is sharp and the other is tarnished respectively
 satat spectrum main sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan ek duusare se sanlagn rahati hai
 Suitable amount of spectrum is used to obtain various spectrums
 rekhiy spectrum uttejit parmaanuon dwaara praapt hota he
 They require heat, electric or highly energetic electromagnetic rings to excite
 saamanyat: vidyut arq or vidyut spark upyog main aate hai
 Atoms are also excited by flame, heat furnace and electric immersion
 vidyut arq - dhaatu ke do electrode ek vishesh prakaar ke stambh main kas die jate hai kintu stambh se pruthgnyast rahete hai
 The space between the electrodes can be reduced or increased by rotating a screwhead
 donon electrode ek parivartaneey avrodh tathaa ek prerakatv shreneekram main jod die jate hai
 Initially both electrodes are connected to drive the arc, so the electrical circuit is completed and current starts flowing
 jahaan electrode satate hai us bindu par bheeshan ooshmaa ootpann hoti he kyonki vahaan avrodh atyant kam hone se sahasaa hajaaron ampior kii dhara pravaahit hoti he
 This heat causes the electrode to evaporate, and even after slightly dissolving them, this steam continues to complete the electrical circuit
 is bhaag main sthit anu-parmaanu uttejit hokar prakaash dene lagate hai
 Arc temperature is about 3500 c From 8000 cm Happens till
 mukhya taar arq chalaane ke purv electrodon ke bich kaa vibhavantar main ke vibhavantar ke baraabar hota he kintu arq chalate samay yah ghat jaataa he
 Arcs are also run from the alternating stream
 aajkal kai prakaar ke sudhare hue arq uplabdh hai
 Electric blasting - is almost like an arc, but the difference of the electrodes of the blasting is several hundred times greater than the arc
 yahi kaaran he ki sphuling kaa stambh adhik surakshit tathaa electrodon se bhalee bhanti pruthgnyast rakhaa jaataa he
 The electrodes are connected to the secondary ends of a stop-up transformer
 sphuling rikt sthaan kaa vibhavantar 10,000 wo
 se 50,000 volt tak hota he; at: is strot main anu-parmaanuon ko atyadhik uttejnaa milti he
 Sphaling spaces can be increased or subtracted at will
 is strot main uttejit honevaale anu parmaanuon ko bahut adhik urja praapt hoti he
 Hence they are ionized
 parmaanu yaa anu ke cendrak ke chaaron or bahut se electron ghoomte rahete hai
 These electrons are divided into different orbits according to certain rules
 sabase baharwali kaksha ke electranon ko "optical electron" kaha jaataa he
 If one or more optical electrons are removed from a molecule or atom, it is said to be "ionized"
 keval ek electron nikal jane par parmaanu pehali ynit sthiti main ho jaataa he
 If the second, third etc
 electrons are also removed, the atom goes into the second, third etc
 ionized position respectively
 in sthitiyon ke liye uttarottar adhik urja deni hoti he
 The 23rd ionized state of tin has been achieved by extremely high-intensity sphilling
 spectro rasinic vishleshan ke liye vidyut sphuling mukhya rup se upyogi hota he
 a variety of improvements have been made to keep the sphincter running continuously
 padaarthon ko prajvalit karne yaa bunsan jwalk kii jwaala main jalaane par pattdaar spectrum praapt hota he
 Plated spectrum can also be obtained by igniting some substances in an electric arc
 gaison main vidyut visarjan se pattdaar spectrum badi suvidha se praapt hote hai
 For electric immersion, filling the gas in a tube at very low pressure has to give a difference of several thousand volts between its ends
 nion gas main vidyut visarjan se rakt varna kii rashmiyaan nikalati hai
 Now-a-days immersion tubes of the size of letters and pictures are made for display and publicity in which neon gas is filled
 inhen nion sin kehete hai
 If a solid substance is given so much heat that it starts glowing red then it continuously emits Rashmipunj
 bijli ke balve se drishyakshetra main satat spectrum paane ke liye vishesh prakaar ke hydrogen lamp, zeenaan arq lamp tathaa paarad-vaashp visarjan kaam main laae jate hai
 Spectrographs are used to obtain a permanent spectrum of the sorghum emitted from different types of spermatozoa
 prayek spectrolekhi main laayaa hua parikshepan sanyantr vibhinn varna kii mishrit rashmiyon ko pruthak kar detaa he
 The dispersion of stones is in three ways: jab rashmiyaan kisi prism se hokar jaati hai tab apvartan ke kaaran pruthak ho jaati hai
 This is called refractory reflection; yadi bahut si sankri jhiriyon ko ek duusari ke samaantar paas paas rakhkar unamem se mishrit prakashpunj bheja jaae to vivartan ke kaaran rashmiyaan alag alag ho jaati hai or spectrum ban jaataa he
 Such dispersion is called invertible reflection; rashmiyon ke vyatikaran dwaara bhi parikshepan utpann kiya jaataa he
 The first two methods are more common
 iske teen mukhya bhaag hote hai - collemetter, prism or camera
 a collimator is a hollow tube with a thin end on one end and a lens on the other end
 zairi or lens kii duuri parivartaneey hoti he tathaa zairi kii chaudaai bhi parivartaneey hoti he tathaa zairi kii chaudaai bhi parivartaneey hoti he
 The prism is thus placed on a firm base
 ki lens se aanevaala samaantar rashmipunj isapar pade
 The spheres reflected from the prism go into the camera and are focused on the photoplatte by the camera lens
 puri vyavastha ek saath is prakaar dhaki rahati he ki zairi ke atirikt or kahin se bhi prakaash bheetar na ja sake
 Such are the spectrographs generally used in the visual and ultraviolet fields
 drishyakshetra main kaam aanevaale spectrolekhi main kaanch ke lens or prism lage rahete hai
 Prisms and lenses of quartz, fluoride, and fluoride are used for the ultraviolet region
 duurastha avarakt ke liye upyogi prism nahin milte hai
 Spectrographs with two or three prisms are designed to increase the deflection
 nirvaat parabangnee kshetra ke liye aise spectrograph kaam aate hai jinase vaayu nikaal di jaati he
 These are called vacuum spectrographs
 ye bade moolyawaan hote hai
 Special types of spectrometers are used for infrared
 infrared spectrometer se kisi padaarth kaa shoshan varnakram praapt hota he
 Continuous infrared rocks are allowed to pass through the material
 padaarth se nikalne ke baad inhen prism yaa grating se vikshepit kiya jaataa he
 The deflected rocks are recorded by thermoelectric recorders
 in spectrometeron main chloride tathaa fluoride ke prism lage rahete hai or lenson ke sthaan par dhaatu kii kalivaale darpan lagaae jate hai
 The grating that is formed by keeping several narrow wrinkles parallel is called grating
 yadi svachh paardarshak kaanch par samaantar rekhaayen khurch di jaaen to pratyak do rekhaon ke bich kaa paardarshak sthaan zairi kaa kaam detaa he
 Such glass is called flat permeable grating
 inkaa upyog prism kii hi bhanti simit he
 If aluminum or silver is cut on a curved surface and parallel lines are scraped on it, this device is called concave reflective grating
 prayek do rekhaon ke bich kaa tal rashmiyon ko paravartit kar detaa he, inhen paravartit rashmiyon ke vivartan se spectrum praapt hota he
 This type of grating was first created by Henry Roland in 1882 AD

 Reflected springs are automatically centered on a circle
 is vrutt ko "rolland vrutt" kehete hai
 The curve on which the lines are scratched is called "grating black"

 The utility of a spectrograph depends on two things
 pehali uski parikshepan kshamta or duusari vibhedan kshamta he
 The more wavelengths of different wavelengths separated by each dispersion plant as they exit the spectral plant, the higher the reflectivity of that spectrograph
 isi prakaar do atyant sameepvarti tarangadairghy kii rekhaon ko ek duusari se thik thik alag dikhaane kii kshamta ko vibhedankshmata kehete hai
 If two lines are taken in a spectrum in which the wavelength of one is λ { \ displaystyle { \ lambda}} and the other is λ { \ displaystyle { \ lambda}} + δ λ { \ displaystyle { \ Delta \ lambda}} more In the differential spectrograph, the two lines appear to be distinct from each other, but in the less differential spectrograph, only one line appears

 Interferometer is used to determine the wavelength of a monochromatic resin very accurately
 faverypero interpherometer or micelson interpherometer is kaary ke liye atyadhik upyogi hote hai
 The wavelength of all the lines is difficult and often unambiguous to be determined from the personometer, so the sharp and sharp lines of an element are considered to be the primary standard and with this the wavelengths of other lines are determined

 If an electron moves to another empty orbit, the energy state of the atom changes
 bhitari kakshaon ke electranon kaa hatana praaia: sambhav nahin hota he kintu antim kaksha kaa electron bahari ooshmaa yaa vidyut shakti se uttejit hone par agali kaksha main ja saktaa he
 If the energy associated with it is K1 in the first orbit and K2 in the next orbit, then the electron can only take K2 - K1 energy to move from the first to the second higher energy state
 uttejit str par jane ke baad hi vah pun: purvasthiti main waapas aata he or k2 - k1 urja utsarjit karata he
 The value of this emitted or absorbed energy is only hn, that is, the electron can take or give a fixed energy point to move or return from one energy level to the next energy level

 Sri Ram Charit Manas is an epic poem written in the 16th century by Goswami Tulsidas in Awadhi language
 is granth ko hindi sahitya kii ek mahaan kriti mana jaataa he
 It is also commonly known as 'tulsi Ramayana' or 'tulsikrit Ramayana'
 ramcharitamanas bhartiya samskruti main ek vishesh sthaan rakhata he
 In North India as 'ramayana' is read daily by many people

 shri ramcharita maanas ke nayak ram hai jinako ek mahashakti ke rup main darshaya gaya he jabaki maharishi valmiki krit ramayana main shri ram ko ek maanav ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he
 Lord Rama of Tulsi, despite being omnipotent, is a modest Purushottam
 treta yug main hue aitihaasik ram-ravan yuddh par aadhaarit or hindi kii hi ek lokapriy bhashaa avadhi main rachit ramcharitamanas ko vishwa ke 100 sarvshereshth lokapriy kaavyon main 46vaan sthaan diya gaya
 Ramcharit Manas is an epic written by 15th-century poet Goswami Tulsidas
 jaisaa tulsidas ne ramcharita maanas ke balkand main swayan likhaa he ki unhone ramcharita maanas kii rachana kaa armbh ayodhya main vikram samvath 1631 ko ramanavami ke din kiya tha
 According to Sri Hanuman Prasad Poddar of Gitapress Gorakhpur, Goswami Tulsidas ji took 2 years 7 months 26 days to write Ramcharitmanas and he completed it on the day of Ram Marriage in Margashirsha Shuklapaksha of Samvat 1633
 is mahakavy kii bhashaa avadhi he jo hindi kii hi ek shakha he
 In Ramcharitmanas, Goswami Tulsidas has described the serene and vivid character of Shri Ramchandra
 maharishi valmiki dwaara rachit sanskrit ramayana ko ramcharitamanas kaa aadhaar mana jaataa he
 Although both the Ramayana and the Ramcharitmanas describe the character of Rama, there is a significant difference in the description style of the poets who composed the epics
 jahaan valmiki ne ramayana main ram ko keval ek sansaarik vyakti ke rup main darshaya he vahiin tulsidas ne ramcharitamanas main ram ko bhagwaan vishnu kaa avatar mana he
 Tulsidas has divided Ramcharitmanas into seven scandal
 in saat kandon ke naam hai - balkand, ayodhyakand, aranyakand, kiskindhakand, sundarkand, lankacand or uttarkand
 According to the number of verses, Balkand and Kishkindhakanda are the largest and the smallest cases respectively
 tulsidas ji ne ramcharitamanas main hindi ke alankaaron kaa bahut sundar prayog kiya he visheshkar anupras alankaar kaa
 Every Hindu has a unique faith in Ramcharitmanas and is considered to be the holy book of Hindus
 tulsidas ji dwaara rachit ramcharita maanas kii kuch chaoupaayiyon ko lete hai
 It is about the time when Manu and Satrupa were doing penance for Parambrahma
 kai varsh tapasya karne ke baad shankaraji ne swayan parvati se kaha ki main, brahma or vishnu kai baar manu satarupa ke paas var dene ke liye aaye, jiskaa ullekh tulsi das ji dwaara rachit ramcharitamanas main is prakaar miltaa he- "bidhi hari har tap dekhi apaara, manu sameep aaye bahu baaraa"
 As the above-mentioned quadrant shows, these people have come many times to say that whatever groom you want to ask, ask for it; But Manu Satarupa had to ask for Parambrahma himself as a son, then how could he ask for a boon from Shankar, Brahma and Vishnu? Our Lord Shri Ram is omniscient
 ve bhakt ke hryday kii abhilaashaa ko swat: hi jaan lete hai
 When 23 thousand more years have passed, the sky is uttered by Prabhu Shriram- "prabhu Sarbagya dasa nij jani, motion exclusive tapas nripa rani
 maangu maangu baru bhai nabh bani, param gambheer kripamrita sani
 
 " is akaash vaani ko jab manu satarupa sunate hai to unka hryday prafullit ho uthta he
 And when Parambrahma Rama himself appears, praising him, Manu and Satarupa say- “sunu sevak surtaru suradhenu, Bidhi hari har bandit pada renu
 sevat sulabh sakal sukhadaayak, prantapal sachrachar nayak
" arthath jinke charnon kii vandana vidhi, hari or har yani brahma, vishnu or mahesh teenon hi karte he, tathaa jinke swaroop kii prashansa sagun or nirgun donon karte hai: unase ve kya var maangen? is baat kaa ullekh karke tulsi baba ne un logon ko bhi ram kii hi aradhana karne kii salaah di he jo keval niraakaar ko hi parambrahm maanate hai
 Many tambaaku ek prakaar ke nicotiana prajati ke ped ke patton ko sukha kar nasha karne kii vastu banaai jaati he
 Actually tobacco is a sweet poison, a slow poison
 It takes a man's life slowly
 sarkaar ko bhi shaayad yah pataa nahin ki tambaaku se vah rajasav praapt kerani he, yah baat to sahi he kintu yah bhi sahi he ki tambaaku se utpann rogon ke ilaaj par jitna kharch kiya jaataa he, yah rajasav usase kahin kam he
 The biggest thing is that the consumption of tobacco also causes loss of biographical power
 vyakti ko pataa chal jaataa he ki tambaaku kaa seven hanikaarak he kintu baad main lakh chhudaane par bhi yah lat chhootati nahin
 So gradually the biographical power in him also decreases and he even surrenders himself to destruction in a way
 yah sarvavidit he ki puure sansar main tambaaku kaa durupyog cigarette ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in India in other forms
 jaise bidi, hukka, gul, gudaku, zarda, kimam, kheni, gutkha aadi ke rup main
 Tobacco should be used in any form, it causes side effects on the body
 bharat main istemaal kiye jane vaale tambaaku kai prakaar ke hote he:- When tobacco is used as gul, gudaku, or khaini, it can cause many diseases in the mouth
 safed daag, munh kaa nahin khul paanaa, tathaa cancer rog bhi ho saktaa he
 Beedi-cigarette smoking has widespread effects in the body
 iske kaaran hriday ke dhamniyon main rakt pravaah kam ho saktaa he
 Heart diseases such as myocardial infarction and anemia may occur
 raktchaap bad saktaa he
 Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, asthma, and lung cancer can occur
 iske atirikt iskaa prabhaav sharir ke snayutantr main padataa he
 It has many other disadvantages
 kishoravastha main utsukata vash yaa mitron ke saath in padaartho kaa seven shuru hota he phir iske nasha kaa anand aane lagata he
 Its quantity is increased
 jo log baar-baar log iskaa seven karte he, unka sharir is maadak padaarth kaa aadi ho jaataa he or phir vah usko chhod nahin pate
 Quitting causes many symptoms such as restlessness, nervousness
 is kaaran log iske aadi ho jate he, usee prakaar jaise log sharaab yaa anya padaarthon ke aadi ho jate he or jab koi kisi padaarth kaa aadi ho jaae to uskaa niyamit seven uski baadhyataa ho jaati he
 Cigarette smokers are not only causing physical harm to themselves by cigarettes but also indirectly causing tobacco poisoning in family and children
 yah sab jaanate hue bhi vah inkaa seven band nahi kar pate
 Whenever they stop consuming it, they feel so uneasy that they start consuming them again
 iske liye aavashyakta he ki vyakti khud ko taiyaar kare ki vah ek nishchit din se dhumrapan karnaa band kar degaa
 Announce it to the whole family
 nishchit din ke pehle ghar se cigarette paauch, ashtray, aadi dhumrapan vastuon ko phenk de
 Stop smoking on a certain day
 yadi dhumrapan karne kii ichha ho to apane ko santvawna de
 Drink more and more water
 aisa karke aap dhumrapan karnaa chhod sakate hai
 a lot of it depends on your will power
 kheni, zarda khaanaa yaa gul, gudaku kaa adhik prayog kisi bhi tarah dhumrapan ke upyog se alag nahi he
 If one wants to give up these substances, then he can prepare himself and get rid of the habits of these substances by willpower
 jab koi vyakti chaah kar bhi tambaaku tathaa usase sambandhit maadak padaarth band nahi kar paye or yadi vah is vishay main bahut gambhir he to iske liye si

 In present times, dictatorship or totalitarianism is the system of governance in which a person rules with the help of poles, ignoring the existing rules
 ekadhinaayakatv, adhinayakawad yaa dictatership us ek vyakti kii sarkaar he jisane shashan uttaradhikaar ke falswaroop nahin varan balpurvak praapt kiya ho tathaa jise purna samprabhutta praapt ho-arthath sampurna raajnneetik shakti na keval usee ke sankalp se udbhoot ho varan kaaryakshetra or samay kii drushti se aseemit tathaa kisi anya satta ke prati uttaradaayi nahin-or vah uskaa prayog bahudhaa aniyantrit dhang se vidhaan ke badale ajyaptiyon dwaara karata ho
 The first to use the word meddle was the Romans, who presumably called some specific administrators to be vexatious because they had no advisors
 roman ganatantr ke samvidhan main ekadhinaayakatv yaa adhinayakawad se taatpary sankatkalin sthiti main kisi ek vyakti ke asthaayee rup se aseemit adhikaar praapt kar lene se tha
 When the crisis arose, the unlimited powers of the monarchy were also abolished and he had to give full details of his experiments while leaving them
 at: vidhaan tathaa shasiton ke prati uttardaayitv adhinaayak kii pramukh visheshta thi
 In the modern era, after the First World War, the violation of legislation for the selfishness of any individual or class became a major feature of monopolyism
 yuddh ne jansadharan ke mastishk ko thakaane ke atirikt usapar sanyam ke sthaan par sainya anushaasan aropit kar sabhi saamaajik kshetron main ajnapaalan kii pravriti utpann kii
 The centralization of power required for military purposes made the people habitual to accept decisions of autocratic power to solve social problems that would not be answerable to anyone
 aisi paristhiti main janatantric paddati vighatit hoti jaan padi
 As a result, in the countries most affected by the war, people were generally ready to welcome such an 'iron man' who would solve problems by his will and order in the name of the nation without taking his opinion on the strength of his valor, confidence and determination
 at: janata ke liye saamanyat: ekadhinaayak vah karmath vyakti hua jo swayan rashtriya pratik ban kisi rahasyatmak aakarshan dwaara apane prati aadar kaa bhav jagaa sake tathaa is aadhaar par logon ko mahaan hone kaa anubhav kara sake ki ve usase sambandhit hai
 The first characteristic of monotheism is in its origin
 kisi desh tathaa yug main isaki sthapana kabhi un sadhano se nahin hoti jo us desh or yug main vaid maane jate hai
 For that it is necessary that its foundation be on the violation of the law, although its existence is not dependent on the non-acceptance of any legislation
 prayek ekadhinaayakatv kaa prarambh viplav se hota he or phir sambhavat: kinhin kaarnon se vah apana krantikari swaroop banaae rakh saktaa he
 But its aim may be to replace the old one with a new one because the monopoly rule presupposes the failure of the old, old system and its destruction for the new system
 uski duusari pramukh visheshta yah he ki janatantr ke vipareet iskaa sanchaalan ek vyakti yaa varg ke haath main dusron par shashan karne ke liye hota he
 Thirdly, the ruling openly declares that it has a special place in the nation
 atev vyapak arth main ekadhinayakeey sarkaar vah vyavastha he jisamen rajya ke ek yaa kai sadsy khule tathaa vyavasthit dhang se puure raashtra par shakti kaa -jise unhone purv ke sabhi vaid aadhikaron or sthapanaaon ke ulanghan ke falswaroop honevaali hinsa se arjeet kiya he-prayog sarkaar main bhaag na lenevaali janata kii sammati se swatantra rahakar karte hai
 Depending on the nature of the government, monopolies can be divided into two categories: vaiyaktik ekadhinaayakatv main ekadhinaayak apane nijee karmchaariyon kii sahaayta se 'fayurar' ke siddhant ke aadhaar par swatantra dhang se shashan karata he
 The specialty of the furor is that he is not responsible to his assistants, but declares his obligation to the nation — history, or God — above himself
 fayurar apane sahaayakon ko niyukt karata he jo apane adheen karmchaariyon ko or ye karmchaaree phir apane adheenon ko niyukt karte hai
 Thus the electoral system has no place in the entire system and the entire structure is observed at the highest peak point
 samuhik ekadhinaayakatv main fayurar ke sthaan par uttaradaayi netaa hote hai; netaaon kii ek shrenee ucchtar shrenee ke netaaon ko chunati he, prayek netaa apane nirvaachakon ke prati uttaradaayi hota he
 Thus, the entire structure is based on the lowest base
 saamaajik shaktiyon ke aadhaar par bhi ekadhinaayakatv ke do varg ho sakate hai
 Therefore, this division takes place on the basis of ruling and auxiliary class
 varg ekadhinaayakatv ke aadhunik teen pramukh prakaar hai : sainya, dal or prashaskeey
 The third classification can be on the basis of quantitative format; As such, adhinayakawad ke teenon vargeekaran ek duusare se sambhddha bhi ho sakate hai
 As such, military monopolies can be both private and collective 
 sabhi mahatvapurn ekadhinaayakataaon main dharmik sampradayikta kii visheshta hoti he, yatha utsaah ke saath pravartak kii puja tathaa ek vishisht vidhi ke prati shraddha
 Driven by great individuals, always inspired by a lucrative ideology, demanding sacrifices as a duty to its followers, monolithicism is a form of government established by an active individual
 vah un parakramee or gatisheel virgo ko lekar chalata he jo swabhaavat: viplav ke liye pravrutt hote hai : yatha, sena, shur varg yaa sarvhaara varg
 Ekadhinayak continues to impose his will and thoughts on the governed
 is aropan ke do saadhan hai: nakaaratmak, sakaaratmak
 Negative means are to stop criticism, destroy anti-majority or minority, keep essential and important facts related to the state a secret
 in sadhano ke sahaayak saadhan hai: sansad kii samaapti, sanghon tathaa dalon kaa vighatan, press par pratibandh, shiksha par niyantran, pramukh virodhiyon kaa nishkasana aadi
 Violence and terror are also discussed in this regard, but in reality these are only the signs of the initial state of monopolies, which are generally revolutionary and therefore illegal
 yadi ekadhinaayakatv is avasthaa se guzarane main safal hua to vah saadhaarant : hinsa or aatank ke sthaan par prashaskeey vidhaan sthapit karata he
 Military monopolies are generally satisfied by these negative means; But class monopolism also uses positive means in addition to these; As such, the imposition of public opinion, views and opinions of public by publicity, creation of favorable opinion etc
 in sadhano ke sahaayak saadhan hai : rashtriya yaa vargpratikon kii puja, uttejk sangeet kaa prasar, dambh yaa ghrinaa kii bhavanaayen ubhaaranevaale bhaashan, ajnapaalan kii aadat daalane ke liye samast raashtra ko sainya shiksha dena, vidyalayon ke liye pustaken taiyaar karnaa, abuddhik vichaardhaara kaa prachaar, raajnneetigyon, patrakaron tathaa vidwaanon ko ghoose dekar unka munh band karnaa
 But in any civilized country, which has had a past or idealist or democratic, these means are not sufficient to establish monotheism as long as it has attractive ideals, such as obedience, discipline, authority, unity, power, patriotism etc
 There should not be a continuous appeal to the person and the person should not be enthusiastic about giving up his personal rights in the hands of the monarch
 iske liye dharm se sambandhit bhaavon ko vikrut kar apane rajya, raashtra, jati yaa varg kii stuti yaa puja ke bhaavon main parinat kiya jaataa he
 Apart from the manner in which monopolistic establishment is established illegally, its elimination is often impossible
 ekadhinayakawad raashtra ko swytt shashan kii vidhiyaan seekhney se roktaa he or isliye ek ekadhinaayak ke dehanth ke baad vyaktiyon or virgo main satta ke liye pratidwandvita raashtra ke liye vipatti kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 There are so many benefits in the practice of the dictatorship system that in many democratic states, the public starts to wish for a dictatorial system, bored with the freedom to arbitrate some people in democracy
 agar adhinayakatantr ke utkarsh ke kaarnon kii khoj kii jaae to vidit hoga ki jis-jis desh main niraashaa, avyavashtha, asantosh tathaa abhaav tha vahiin adhinayakatantr kaa udai hua he
 In countries where the system of democracy became frustrating and lacking in people, this system was established
 aaj bhi anek rajyon main janata adhinayakatantr ko acha maanakar nirankush shaskaon kaa purna samarthan karti hui dikhaai detii he
 From this it is clear that the Adhinayaktantra has some qualities which are responsible for the motivation to adopt this system despite the theoretical superiority of other systems
 sankshep main aise shashan ke nimnlikhit laabh hai- Governance is efficient in the dictatorship
 sari shashan shakti ek vyakti main nihit hone ke kaaran, na keval nirnay shighrata se liye ja sakate he, varan nirnyon ke kriyanvayan kii bhi suvyavastha ho jaati he
 In the dictatorial system, everyone is afraid of the ruler, therefore, he cannot delay or relax the work
 nirankush shaasha ke prati sampoorn prashasan na keval uttaradaayi rahata he apitu har samay satark, sachet va sakriy bhi rahata he
 This leads to efficiency in governance
 is vyavastha kaa doosraa gun desh kaa teji se vikaas he
 Having only one leader, one plan and one development goal in the country, the entire power of the country is used to pave the way to this goal
 aarthik sadhano kaa samuchit vikaas va upyog sambhav hota he
 The development of the country requires unity, peace and order
 adhinayakatantr main inaki thos vyavastha rahane ke kaaran desh ke saare saadhan vikaas main lagaae ja sakate hai
 The dictatorship is very helpful in establishing unity in the country
 vibhinn dalon tathaa virodhiyon kaa daman karke desh main ek dal va ek netaa kaa shashan sthapit hone ke kaaran sari janata iske prati vafaadaar ho jaati he
 All the arrangements around the leader are intertwined and the country is tied into a single thread of solid unity
 dal yaa netaa ekta main baandhne kaa saadhan ho jaataa he or usee main sabko apnatv kaa abhas hone lagata he
 Hitler and Mussolini were similarly successful in uniting Germany and Italy
 rashtinyata kii bhaavana jaagrath karne main sahaayak he
 Having an ideology, a party and a leader is sufficient to bind the citizens of the country in reciprocity
 sabhi naagarik bandhutv kii bhaavana se anupranit rahete hai
 The slogan of a nation makes everyone stand under the same flag
 desh bhakthi kaa itnaa prabalya hota he ki naagarik apane desh tathaa netaa ke liye balidaan tak karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 The dictatorial system is the best in times of crisis
 isamen sankat kaa saamana karne ke liye sabhi nirnay va adarsh ek vyakti dwaara diye jane ke kaaran, adeshon kii ekta rahati he
 This makes it easy to take appropriate action on time
 yudhkalin sankat main to yahi vyavastha vijay dilaati he
 Multifaceted development of the country takes place in a dictatorial system
 aarthik kshetra main bhi teji se vikaas kii vyavastha hoti he
 Due to unity, discipline and duty-devotion, the best system of development is achieved
 rus, germany, china, italy, turki or spain kaa abhi tak itihaas is baat kaa sakshi he
 In his book Europe Sins the War, Jackson rightly writes - "this is the first time in the history of the Spaniards that the trains have run on time
" adhinaayak ke adheen vyapaar or udyog samrudh hue hai
 Agriculture is fruitful
 shram sankat dur ho gaye hai
 " kuch vidwaan adhinayakatantr ko maanav-swabhaav ke anukool bhi maanate hai
 In its favor, he says that human beings naturally have a desire to protect their interests
 vah apni raksha chahta he chaahe yah kisi ke dwaara kii jaay
 Wants to solve his problems
 aam janata ko isse koi matlab nahin hota he ki uski raksha vyavastha cor karata he? vah to suraksha chaahati he, apane hiton kii purti chaahati he
 Due to such a possibility in Adhinayakatantra, it is also considered a system suited to human nature
 vikasshil rajyon ke liye raajnneetik or aarthik vikaas kii sankramanakalin paristhitiyon main bhi adhinayakatantr upyogi mana gaya he
 In developing states, the problem of disciplined expression of public will has been very strong
 vikaas ke vibhinn charnon ko paar karne ke prayaas main navdith raashtra jan aakankshaon ko jaagrit to kar dete hai, parantu jan aakankshaayen jitani teji se jaagrit hoti hai, utani teji se ve unki purti nahin kar pate hai
 Due to this, the tension on the state system increases and there is a fear of its breakdown
 aisi sthiti main raajnneetik anushaasan banaae rakhane ke liye adhinayakatantr adhik upyogi ho saktaa he
 Huntington has rightly said that 'the first task in the newly born nations should be to build a basic, institutional structure in place of increase of political participation, education etc
 and for this one-party rule or military dictatorship may also be appropriate
 ’ Despite the merits of the Adhinayaktantra, this system is not practiced in any country for a long period
 itihaas aise pramaanon se bharaa padaa hai jahaan kahin bhi adhinayakatantr sthapit hota he vahiin par ek sthiti aisi aati he jab janata satta sampann sarvocch shaasha ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye hinsaatmak kranti tak kaa sahaara lene main nahin hichkichaati he
 It is clear from this that some shortcomings are definitely found in this system
 sankshep main is pranali ke dosha is prakaar hai- Due to the lack of respect for the personality of the person in this system, despite all the facilities, the person does not get the environment to develop his personality according to his will and he is forced to keep his life incomplete
 vyakti ko kisi bhi prakaar swatantraaa nahin rahati he
 This keeps his personality suppressed
 taanaashaahee vyavastha main moulik adhikaron evam vyaktigat swatantraaa ko koi mahatv nahin diya jaataa he
 Therefore, the biggest drawback of the dictatorial system is to create an atmosphere of repression of the personality of the person
 adhinayakatantr shashan vyavastha main atyaachaar or anachar kaa bolbalaa rahata he
 The dictator continues to spread terror to maintain his power
 virodhiyon kaa barbar tareekon se safaya kar diya jaataa he
 Due to this, humans get frightened and get locked up in jail
 desh hit main kahi gai baat bhi agar taanashaah kii ichha ke pratikul he to usko thukraa diya jaataa he tathaa uske viruddh baat kehane vaale ko deshvidrohi kahkar maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 The dictatorial system is detrimental to the country
 is vyavastha main nirnay ek vyakti letaa he jo kisi bhi prakaar kaa virodh yaa suzav sweekaar nahin karata he
 Due to this, the whole people have to suffer the harmful effects of wrong decisions taken by the dictator
 adhinaayak kaa har nirdesh logon ko maananaa padataa he, chaahe vah nirdesh rashtiy hit main ho athwa nahin ho
 Thus, there is no proper protection of national interests in dictatorial system
 adhinayakatantr main saadhaaran vyaktiyon main aatm-nirbharta, kriyasheeltaa tathaa swatantraaa kii bhaavana kaa purnatah lop ho jaataa he, kyonki unhen bolne athwa vichaarne aadi kii kisi prakaar kii swatantraaa nahin rahati he
 In this system, a person's body, wealth and even his mind becomes for the Adhinayak and he is forced to walk wherever the Adhinayak is
 adhinayakatantr ke gun or dosha ke vivechan se spasht he ki yah vyavastha manushya ko manushya nahin banaati tathaa use manushya ke rup main rahane bhi nahin detii he
 In this, the personality of the human remains suppressed
 uski sari bhautik aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke uparant bhi usko kuch kami si mahasoos hoti he
 His life becomes like a prisoner
 isliye hi adhinayakatantr ke anek laabhon ke hote hue bhi koi vyakti is vyavastha ke antargat rahanaa pasand nahin karata he
 Everything remains for the person in this regime, but still he suffocates in such a system, because the person does not live only for bread
 vah iske alaava bhi bahut kuch paanaa va karnaa chahta he jo keval sochane-vichaarne tathaa abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke vaataavaran main hi sambhav hota he
 Therefore, in spite of all the attractions of the Adhinayaktantra, stress remains invalid by the common people due to it being a deterrent to the means of satisfying the hunger of the brain
 is shashan ke gun-dosha ke vivechan ke baad iske bhavishya ke bare main sanket dena saral ho jaataa he

 Because the Earth's axis revolving around the sun in its orbit is at an angle of 23
4 °, the same angle is also in the ecliptic and celestial midline

 The "celestial middle line" is called the "celestial equator" in English
 "khagoleey gole" ko angrezi main "salastial sfair", farsi main "kara-e-aasmaan" or bengali main "kha-golok" kehete hai
 On the equinox, which falls on 21 March and 23 September, the sun at twelve o'clock is just above the equator of the Earth
 kyonki khagoleey madhya rekha kii paribhaasha yahi he ke vah prithvi ke bhu madhya rekha ke upar hoti he, isliye in krantivrutt or khagoleey madhya rekha in do sthanon main ek dusre ko katati hai
 On the days of solstice, the sun is at the farthest distance from the Earth's equator, which is the same two days of extreme distances from the celestial middle line of the same eclipse
