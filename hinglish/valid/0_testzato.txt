 Sanjay Kumar was injured
 aisi sthiti main gambheertha ko dekhte hue rifl main sanjay kumaar ne tay kiya ki us thikaane ko achaanak hamale se khamosh kara diya jaae
 With this intention, Sanjay suddenly attacked the place and killed three enemy soldiers in a face-to-face encounter and in the same zeal, fired towards the other hideout
 sanjay is muthbhed main khud bhi lahu luhaan ho gaye the, lekin apni ore se beparwaah wo dushman par tut pade
 Due to the sudden attack, the enemy got frightened and fled and in this stampede, the enemy also left their universal machine guns
 sanjay kumaar ne wo gan bhi hathiyaan or usase dushman kaa hi safaya shuru kar diya
 Seeing this act of Sanjay, the other soldiers of his troop were very excited and very swiftly attacked the enemy's other targets
 jakhmi hone ke baavjood sanjay kumaar tab tak dushman se jujhate rahe the, jab tak ki point flats top pakistaniyon se puri tarah khaali nahin ho gaya
 After this, the kumuk of the platoon reached there for help and the injured Sanjay Kumar was immediately admitted to the military hospital

 sikandar baag, bhartiya rajya uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu kii seemaa par sthit ek baag yaa udyaan he jisame aitihaasik mahatv kii ek haveli samahit he
 It was built as the summer residence of Wajid Ali Shah, the Nawab of Awadh

 Nowadays there is office of Indian National Botanical Research Institute

 At the time of the siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, hundreds of Indian soldiers surrounded by British and colonial soldiers took refuge in this garden
 16 november 1857 ko british phujon ne baag par chadhaai kar lagbhag 2000 sipaahiyon ko maar daalaa tha
 During the battle, the dead British soldiers were buried in a deep pit but the dead bodies of the dead Indian soldiers were left to rot

 As long as he had ammunition, he did not allow the British invading troops to enter the garden but when his ammunition ran out he was riddled with bullets by the British troops
 gyanamimasaa darshan kii ek shakha he
 Gyanamimamsa attracted the attention of thinkers in modern times
 darshanashastra kaa dhyey sat ke swaroop ko samajhnaa he
 Thinkers have been making this discovery for centuries, but still seem to be as far away from a definite conclusion as they were before
 aadhunik kaal main dekart kaa dhyaan aayaa ki praytn kii asafalataa kaa kaaran yah he ki darshanik kuch agrim kalpanaaon ko lekar chalate rahe hai
 Philosophy can achieve the certainty of mathematics only if it does not accept any notion which is not self-proven
 usne vyapak andeh se aarambh kiya
 His own consciousness showed him an object whose existence cannot be doubted: doubt itself is a shape or form of consciousness
 is neenv par usne, apane vichaar main, paramatma or sristi ke astitv ko siddh kiya
 Decart's interpretation was new, but like the ancestors, his affection was also in philosophy
 jon lock ne apane liye nayaa maarg chunaa
 There has been controversy about the truth for centuries
 pehle to yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki hamaare gyaan kii pahunch kahan tak he
 These questions were also related to what is knowledge and how to get it
 europe mahadweep ke darshanikon ne darshan ko ganit kaa praturup dena chaha tha, lock ne apana dhyaan manovigyaan kii ore pheraa "maanav buddhi par niabandh" kii rachana kii
 This epochal book proved to be, it is considered to be the foundation of empiricism
 george barkale ne lock kii aalochana main "maanavgyan" ke niyam likhakar anubhavvaad ko aage badhaayaa or david hum ne "maanav prakruti" main ise charam seemaa tak pahunchaa diya
 The special significance of Hume's ideas is that he opened the way to Kant's "criticalism"
 kaant ne gyanamimasaa ko darshanashastra kaa kendriya prashn bana diya
 But it took a long time for Jnanamimamsa to get proper position in the west
 bharat main kabhi isaki upeksha hui hi nahin
 In the first Sutras in Gautama's Nyasutras, 16 thinkers have been described, whose real knowledge leads to the attainment of free Shreyas
 inamen pratham do vishay "pramaan" or "prameya" hai
 These are both knowledge and knowledge
 yah ullekhneey he ki in donon main bhi pratham sthaan "pramaan" ko diya gaya he
 Knowledge, the knower and the known are concerned
 dekart ne apane anubhav ke vishleshan se aarambh kiya, parantu manushya saamaajik praani he, uskaa anubhav shunya main nahin viksit hota
 The history of philosophy is a story of debate
 plato ne apana mat sanvaadon main vyakt kiya
 The existence of more than one consciousness is accepted in dialogue
 gyanamimasaa main vivechan kaa vishay vaiyaktik chetana nahin, apitu saamaajik chetana ban jaati he
 Knowledge has its own undeniable existence, but it also contains the following acknowledgments - k
 gyaan se bhinn gyaata he, jise gyaan hota he
 B
 Knowledge is the result of contact with more than one knowledgeable person
 ga
 gyaan kaa vishay gyaan se bhinn he
 Each assumption claims to be true
 parantu mimasaa is daawey ko uchit jaanch ke bina sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 We will examine these assumptions now, but first it is necessary to say something about the nature of knowledge
 gyanamimasaa main pramukh prashn ye hai- Nature of knowledge: Consent, belief and knowledge When we listen to a thought or think about it, our attitude in that regard is as follows - sweekruti ke kai str hote hai
 There is occasional acceptance at the lowest level, it is called consent
 yah sweekruti pramanit nahin hoti, ise tyaagna pade to hamen koi virakti nahin hoti
 With consent, sharpness and liveliness prevail
 dharmik vishwaason par jamen rahane ke liye manushya har prakaar kaa ksht sahan kar letaa he
 Both faith and consent are personal works, knowledge does not have this limitation
 main yah nahin kahata ki meri sanmati main do or do chaar hote hai, na yah kahata hoon ki mere vishwaas ke anusaar, yadi k or kha donon ga ke baraabar hai to ek duusare ke bhi baraabar hai
 These are such facts, which every intelligent creature must accept, there is a difference in consents, knowledge is one for all
 gyaan main sanmati kii atmparakta kaa sthaan vastuparakata le leti he
 According to empiricism, there are only two parts of the material - effects and their images
 dravya ke liye inamen koi gyaan nahin
 Hume said that just as physical matter is nothing but a conglomerate, similarly nothing but a group of experienced experiences
 in donon samoohon main ek bhed he -- kul ke sabhi gun ek saath vidyaman hote hai, chetan kii chetnavasthaayen ek duusare ke baad prakat hoti hai
 Consciousness is a category or line and no line can be perceived to be a row by itself
 hriday kii vyakhya main samaran shakti ke liye koi sthaan nahin; jaise wiliam james ne kaha, anubhavvaad ko smriti maangani padati he
 Hume did not find the knowledgeable material; He could not be found there
 anubhavvaad ke liye prashn tha -- anubhav kya bataata he? peeche kaant ne poocha -- anubhav banataa kaise he? anubhav anbhavi kii kriya ke bina ban hi nahin saktaa
 Man is a social animal; Our whole life and lives with humans
 purushabahutv vyapak sweekruti he
 The question for epistemology is, is this acceptance a state of conviction or knowledge? Dreams are a cause for doubt in this matter
 swapn main main dekhtaa sunata prathit hota hoon; anya manushyon ke saath sansarg bhi hota prathit hota he
 Is awakening and dreaming also a dream? According to egoism, the whole power is a heavy fantasy
 hamaara saamaajik jivan ahamvaad kaa khandan he, parantu prashn to saamaajik jivan ke sambandh main hi he -- kya yah jivan vishwaas maatr hi to nahin? ahamvaad ke viruddh koi aisa pramaan nahin jise akhandaneey kah saken
 When we suffer from such doubt then, as Hume has said, after a short time we find ourselves exhausted and our attention is forced to turn to the world, which also contains material things and conscious beings
 jab buddhi kaam nahin karti, prakruti hamaari sahaayta karti he
 According to empiricism, all knowledge is made up of influences and pictures in the end
 prabhaav main gunbodh or vastuwaad kaa bhed kar sakate hai; chitra main pratibimb or pratyay kaa bhed hota he
 Every knowledge center recognizes a particular quality - eye form, ear word, nose smell
 in gunon ke samanvay se vastugyan praapt hota he
 It is also called Pratibodh or Pratishtha
 aise bodh main gyaan kaa vishay gyaata ke baahar hota he; pratibimb or pratyay andar hote hai
 Whether the distinction between outside and inside is just fiction or fact, it has been a major question in Jnanamimamsa
 pratibodh yaa pratyaksh gyaan ne jitna dhyaan aakarshith kiya he, utana gyanamimasaa main kisi anya prashn ne nahin kiya
 According to the Sankhya philosophy, there are two main signs of the direct - pratyaksh indriya or vishay ke sampark kaa parinaam hota he
 In a direct way, the mind takes the shape of the subject
 iskaa arth yah he ki pratyaksh gyaan kalpanamaatr nahin hota or isamen kisi prakaar kii bhranti nahin hoti
 It is clear that we do not have more reliable knowledge than direct, but the question is whether there can be direct contact between the subject and the subject
 yadi aisa sampark hota he, to bhranti kaise pravisht ho jaati he? vishayi or vishay main kuch antar hota he
 The condition of this difference affects our perception
 jangal ke vriksh dur se harenhin dikhte, kyonki unke rang ke saath bich main padanevaali vaayu kaa rang bhi mil jaataa he
 Then, the state of our senses is not the same, the ear patient sees things yellow
 kuch vichaarak kehete hai ki ham bahya padaarthon ko nahin dekhte, unke chitron ko dekhte hai, in chitron ke vishay main nishchaypurvak nahin kah sakate ki ye bahya padaarthon ke anuroop hai; yahan bhranti kii sambhaavna sadaa bani rahati he
 There are two forms of realism - reflective realism and reflective realism
 pehle rup main bhranti kaa astitv samasya ban jaataa he, duusare rup main satya gyaan kaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Cynicism eliminates the difference between inside and outside
 jaan lock ke vichaaron main hi iskaa beej vidyaman tha
 He said that the suffix of the substance is unclear
 usne yah bhi kaha ki bhautik padaarthon ke pradhan gun to unamem vidyaman hote hai, parantu apradhan gun ve parinaam hai jo pradhan gunon ke aghat se hamaare man main vyakt hote hai
 Berkeley said that the tips which are given against the objective existence of the secondary qualities, are given against the principal properties
 baahar kuch he hi nahin, uske bodh ke spasht yaa aspasht hone kaa prashn pratyay ban gaya he
 The senses are not qualities of external substances, nor are they mental states
 ye gyaata se bhinn, uske baahar hai or unka swatantra astitv he
 According to Rassala, there exist groups of "senses", some parts of them are acquired
 hamaara paribodh satya gyaan he, parantu aanshik gyaan
 Kant started his famous book "critique of Pure Wisdom" with these words - "is baat main to andeh hi nahin ho saktaa ki hamaara sara gyaan anubhav ke saath aarambh hota he
 Because how is it possible that perception power starts doing something, except that the substances that affect our senses give it this ability
 parantu yadhyapi hamaara sara gyaan anubhav ke saath aarambh hota he, isse yah nishkarsh nahin nikalataa ki sara gyaan anubhav kii hi dein he
 Kant emphasized the contribution of intelligence to the design of experience
 aisa karne par bhi, usne aarambh main kaha ki hamaara vichaar prakatano kii duniya se pare nahin ja saktaa
 Back, he distinguished between the perceptive intellect and practical intelligence, and said that the transcendent intellect gives knowledge, but this knowledge is power beyond the world of manifestations
 manushya sarabhoot rup main naitik praani he
 The demands of the policy are - bharat main para vidya or aparaa vidya main bhed kiya gaya he or donon main pratham ko unchaa pad diya he
 Some thinkers call Apara Vidya as Avidya only
 plato ne vishesh padaarthon ke bodh ko sammati kaa pad diya or sammati ko vidya or avidya ke madhya main rakhaa
 Every decision claims to be true
 is daawey kaa arth kya he? The decision involves the relation of two suffixes or ideas
 yadi yah sambandh un padaarthon main bhi vidyaman he jo un vichaaron ke mul hai, to nirnay satya he
 This solution of truth is called conformism
 vigyaanavaad bahya jagat ko kalpana maatr kahata he, iske anusaar satta main chetnaaon or chetan avasthaaon ke atirikt kuch bhi nahin he
 If a decision can be connected to the rest of knowledge, it is true
 yah avirodhwaad he
 Pragmatism has spread in America during the modernism period
 iske anusaar, jo dharna vyavhaar main safal siddh hoti he, vah satya he
 Truth is not a permanent thing that we see; It is made
 vastav main yahan do prashn hai -- satya kaa swaroop kya he? kisi dharna ke satya hone kii kasuti kya he? anurupatavaad pehle prashn kaa uttar detaa he tathaa avirodhwaad or vyavahaarwad duusare prashn kaa

 a boat or yacht is a type of small ship carried by a shank, saddle, paddle, rudder or sail
 aajkal naaven ingine se bhi chalane lagi hai or itani badi bhi banane lagi hai ki pot or nauka ke bich bhed karnaa kathin ho jaataa he
 In fact, both ship and boat are synonyms, but often the word yacht is used to mean small and vessel big
 pracheen chitron main bade bade jahaaj to kuch acchhee tarah chitrit dekhe jate hai, kintu naavon ke chitra yadi kahin hai bhi to atyant angadh or asaavadhaneepurvak bane hue
 Somewhere along with the rock-cut remains have also been found in the excavations
 puranic jalplavan ke baad shatapath brahman ke anusaar manu ke, bible ke anusaar nuh ke or yunaan ke apolodares ke anusaar diukaliyan ke naav main chadhakar bachane kii kathaayen anek deshon main milti hai
 Boats have been mentioned in many other texts, but nowhere is the description of the nature of the boat
 isliye bade bade jahaajon kii tulana main naavon kaa praarambhik itihaas praaia: agyaat hi he
 Nowadays, looking at the primitive forms of boats, only the contours of their evolution and development can be conceived
 adivaasiyon ne idhar udhar jane or apana saamaan dhane ke liye jab nadi naale paar karne ke aarambhik prayaas kiye honge tab unhen lakdi yaa halake padaarthon kii kuch maatra baandhakar, yaa phir kisi vriksh kaa tana kolkar tathaa use pani main tairaakar, apane uddeshy main safalataa mili hogi
 In these we can consider the origin of boat or ship
 yah vivaadaaspad he ki tana kolkar banaai hui dongi pehle astitv main ai yaa pani par tairanevaale sarapat, narkul aadi kaa bedaa
 Probably the bark canoes were made even later and after that, by filling the air in leather tassels of animals, planting grass chaff, wood etc
 on it, people started crossing into the water
 saath hi saath chamade kii pansuia bhi banane lagi hongi
 These were some improved forms
 kuch bhi ho, yah ascharyajanak tathy he ki bahut dur dur deshon main sthit, aapas main kabhi bhi ek duusare se sampark main na aa sakanevaale logon ke man main alag alag, ek jaise hi vichaar utpann hue
 Initially these fleets or canoes will depend on the flow of water for their speed
 kintu jab kisi ne yah khoj kii hogi ki kisi latthe yaa chappu kii sahaayta se vah inhen icchaanusaar idhar udhar, nadi kii dhara ke aar paar, yaa pravaah ke saath, athwa ulate bhi le ja saktaa he, tab use apni safalataa par avashya hi bada harsh or garv hua hoga
 Then, while admiring the rivers, lakes and the Kutch, people must have started going to the sea off the coast sometimes in good weather
 dhire dhire prayog se uski maang badi, trutiyon kii khoj hui or sudhaar bhi sujhe
 Needed to increase speed
 bede ke chaaron ore se or uske bich main se bhi, pani uchhalkar upar aa jaataa tha, isse bhi bachanaa tha
 This speed and the need to keep the drought above, in the history of Nathu, from the beginning to the present day, has inspired the man to improve the way he invented
 kuch drushtiyon se dongi acchhee rahi, to kuch drushtiyon se bedaa
 Just as the canoe does not contain water, but it has neither the same carrying capacity as the fleet nor the stability
 naav naam se donon hi aaj tak kaam aate hai or donon hi upyogitaaon ko milakar hi bhanti bhanti kii naaven banaai gai hai
 As people learned the art of adding wooden planks, even though they were cut from axes, and were made out of a rough shape, they also started building water-repellent boats
 isamen chaude pende ke kaaran bede kii bhaanti sthery or unchi deevaaron ke kaaran dongi kii bhanti sookhaa sthaan uplabdh hue
 Gradually, its ends were made somewhat round, some pointed, some elevated, likewise

 International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories
 
 adhikansh deshon main, yah sakal gharelu utpaada ke mahatvapurn ansh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 While international trade has been present for most of its history, its economic, social and political importance has begun to increase in recent centuries
 antarrashtriya vyapaar vyavastha par audyogikaran, unnat parivahan, vaishvikaran, bahurashtriya nigam or bahyasrot se kaarynishpaadan, in sabhi kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Increasing international trade is important for the continuation of globalization
 antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bina, desh sirf apni khud kii seemaa ke bheetar utpaadit maal or sevaaon tak simit rah jaaenge
 International trade is no different from domestic trade in principle because the motivation and behavior of the parties involved in a trade does not change fundamentally, regardless of whether the trade is cross-border or not
 mukhya antar yah he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar aam taur par gharelu vyapaar se adhik mahangaa he
 The reason for this is that a border usually imposes additional charges such as tariffs, periodic costs due to delays on the border and costs associated with country variations such as language, legal system or culture
 gharelu or antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bich ek or antar yah he ki puunji or shram jaise utpaadan kaarak aam taur par baahar kii tulana main deshon ke bheetar adhik gatisheel hote hai
 Thus international trade is mostly limited to the trade of goods and services and only on a small scale in trade of capital, labor or other factors of production
 In addition, trade in goods and services can act as a substitute for trade in production factors
 utpaadan kaa ek kaarak aayaat karne ke bajaay, ek desh maal aayaat kar saktaa he jo utpaadan ke kaarak kaa gahan istemaal kare or is prakaar sambandhit kaarak ko sammilit kar le
 ek udhaaharan he, china se sanyukt rajya america dwaara shram-pradhan vastuon kaa aayaat
 chini shram kaa aayaat karne ke bajaay america, china se aise maal aayaat kar rahaa he jise chini shram ke istemaal se utpaadit kiya gaya he
 International trade is also a branch of economics, which together with international finance forms the broad branch of international economics
 vyapaar kii paddati kaa purvanumaan lagane or prashulk jaisi vyapaar nitiyon ke prabhaav kaa vishleshan karne ke liye anek alag namoonay prastaavit kiye gaye hai
 The Ricardian model focuses on comparative advantage and is perhaps the most important concept in international trade theory
 ek ricardian model main, desh un chizon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata hasil karte hai jin chizon kaa utpaadan ve acha karte hai
 Unlike other models, the Ricardian framework predicts that countries will specialize instead of producing a wide range of goods
 iske alaava, ricardian model kaarak nidhi par sidhe vichaar nahin karata, jaise desh ke bheetar shram or puunji kii saapeksh maatra
 ricardin model kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki yah deshon ke bich praudyogiki bhinnataaon kii kalpana karata he
 The technology gap is easily incorporated into the Ricardian and ricardo-sraffa models
 ricardian model nimnlikhit anumaan lagaataa he: The Ricardian model makes short-term measurements, so the technology varies internationally
 yah is tathy kaa samarthan karata he ki desh apane tulanaatmak laabh kaa paalan karte hai or visheshgyata ke liye anumati dete hai
 The Ricardian business model was studied by Graham, Jones, Mackenzie and others
 sabhi siddhanton main madhyavarti maal, vasteen or puunjigat maal jaise vyapaarit input maal ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 mckenzie, Jones, and Samuelson emphasized that considerable profits would be lost by the exclusion of intermediate goods from trade
 In a famous comment Mackenzie stated that "the idea of a moment would explain to a person that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if cotton had to be grown in England
" haal hi main, is siddhant ko vistaarit karte hue isamen vyapaarik madhyavarti maamle ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Thus the "labor only" assumption was removed from the theory
 is prakaar nayaa ricardian siddhant, jise kabhi-kabhi ricardo-srapha model kaa naam bhi diya jaataa he, saidhantik rup se puunjigat vastuon ko shaamil karata he jaise mashine or samagriyaan, jinka deshon ke bich kaarobaar hota he
 In times of global trade, this assumption is more realistic than the heckscher-olin model, which assumes that capital is stable within the country and not internationally dynamic
 1900 ke dashak ke armbh main, do swedish arthshaastriyon, eli heksher or bertil olin ne kaarak anupaat siddhant naam ke ek antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant kaa srijan kiya
 This theory is also called the heckscher-olin theory
 heksher-olin siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki deshon ko aise maal kaa utpaadan or niryaat karnaa chahie jise aise sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho, jo prachur hon or aise maal kaa aayaat karnaa chahie jise alp-aapurti vaale sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho
 This theory differs from the theories of comparative advantage and absolute advantage because these theories focus on the productivity of the production process for a particular commodity
 iske vipareet, heksher-olin siddhant kahata he ki ek desh ko utpaadan or niryaat main un karkon kaa upyog karte hue visheshgy hona chahie jo sabase prachur maatra main hon or isliye saste hon
 un maal kaa utpaadan naa karen, jaisaa ki pehle ke siddhanton ne kaha, jo ve sabase adhik kushalta se utpaadit karte hai
 The Heckscher – Olin model was constructed as an alternative to the Ricardian model of basic comparative advantage
 isaki adhik jatilta ke baavjood yah apane purvanumaanon main adhik sateek sabit nahin hua
 But from a theoretical point of view it provides an elegant solution by incorporating neo-classical value mechanisms into international trade theory
 is siddhant kaa tark he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar kaa pattern, kaarak nidhi main antar se nirdhaarit hota he
 It predicts that countries will export goods that use locally abundant factors and will import goods that use factors that are locally scarce
 H-O model ke saath anubhavjanya samasyaayein, jise leontiff virodhabhas ke rup main janaa jaataa he, wesile leontiff dwaara anubhavjanya pareekshanon main saamne ain jinhone paaya ki puunji kii bahutayat hone ke baavjood america shram-pradhan maalon ko niryaat kar rahaa tha
 The HO model makes the following main assumptions: H-O siddhant ke saath samasya yah he ki yah puunjigat vastuon ke vyapaar ko shaamil nahin karata he 
H-O siddhant main, shram or puunji, prayek desh ke liye sthir padaarth hai
 In a modern economy, capital goods are traded internationally
 madhyavarti vastuon ke vyapaar se laabh kaaphi hota hai, jaisaa ki samuelson dwaara bal diya gaya tha 
 Many economists prefer the Heckscher – Olin theory than the Ricardo theory, as it makes less straightforward assumptions
 1953 main, wesile leontiff ne ek adhyayan prakashit kiya, jahaan unhone heksher-olin siddhant kii vaidhata kaa pareekshan kiya
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki anya deshon kii tulana main america puunji main adhik prachur tha, isliye america puunji-pradhan maal kaa niryaat kar rahaa tha or shram-pradhan maal kaa aayaat
 leontiff ne paaya ki aayaat kii tulana main america kaa niryaat kam puunji-pradhan tha
 After the Leontief paradox emerged, many researchers tried to save the heckscher-olin theory, either by new methods of measurement, or by new interpretations
 Leamer emphasized that Leontief did not correctly interpret the HO theory and claimed that contradiction did not occur with a correct interpretation
 brechar or choudri ne paaya ki, agar limar sahi tha, to america mazaduron kii prati vyakti khapat, mazdooron ke vishwa ausat khapat se kam honi chahie
 Later several other tests took place but most of them failed
 kai prasiddh pathyapustak lekhak, jinamein shaamil hai krugman or obstfeld or boven, holender or vien, H-O model kii vaidhata ke bare main nakaaratmak hai
 
 After testing a long history of empirical research, Bowen, Hollander, and VN concluded: "recent tests of the factor abundance theory that directly examine the HOV equations also indicate a rejection of the theory"
 : 321 heksher-olin siddhant ko dakshin-uttar vyapaar samasyaon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye acchhee tarah anukulit nahin kiya gaya he
 Estimates of HO are less realistic regarding NS than NN trade
 uttar or dakshin ke bich aay bhinnata hi ek aisi chiz he jisaki teesri duniya ko sabase zyada parvaah hoti he
 The factor price equalization has not shown much sign of recovery
 HO model maanata he ki deshon ke bich samaan utpaadan kaary karata he
 This is very unrealistic
 viksit or vikasshil deshon ke bich praudyogiki kii bhinnata, garib deshon ke liye chintaa kaa mukhya vishay he
 In this model, labor mobility between industries is possible, while capital is stable between industries in the short term
 is prakaar, is model ko heksher-olin model ke ek 'alpakaaleen' sanskaran ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 The specific factor name refers to what is provided, in the short term, specific factors of production such as physical capital are not easily transferable between industries
 siddhant yah suzav detaa he ki agar maal kii keemat main vruddhi hoti he, to us maal ke vishisht sandarbh main utpaadan ke kaarak ke maalikon ko vaastavik rup se acha laabh hoga
 In addition, owners of specific factors of anti-production are likely to have opposing agendas when they seek favors to control labor immigration
 iske vipareet, puunji or shram, donon ke maalikon ko puunji nidhi main vruddhi se vaastavik rup main laabh hota he
 This model is ideal for particular industries
 yah model aay vitaran ko samajhane ke liye adarsh he lekin vyapaar kii paddati kii charchaa karne ke liye bhadda he

 In one example of this framework, the economy exhibits monopoly competition and increasing profits on a scale

 Regulation of international trade is done globally through the World Trade Organization and through many other regional arrangements such as MERCOSUR in South America, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, and European between 27 independent countries Union

 Of particular importance is the role of governments in deciding whether they will allow international businesses to setup their operations and encourage them to grow and succeed
 aksar, kai deshon kii sarkaron ke liye ek vikalp nahin he lekin antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat karne ke rup main ve "nakadi" yaa dollar kii jarurat he, kyonki ve bhi janaa jaataa he
 For example, the difference between exports and imports is known as current account deficit or CAD

 Then, governments can borrow losses at high rates or finance losses through FDI or foreign direct investment and equity flows from fiis or foreign institutional investors to the stock markets
 iske alaava, gharelu udyog kshamtaaon ko ek vishesh kshetra he or na hi visheshgyata he ki kshetra kaa vikaas karne main safal hone ke liye nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, FDI becomes necessary for the development of that region
 iske alaava, arthvyavastha ke khulne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan yaa vishwa vyapaar sanghathan, jiskaa matlab he ki aadesh main, anya deshon ko niryaat karne ke liye ubharate bazaar or vikasshil arthvyavasthaaon main kholane ke liye he ki main pravesh ke liye aavashyak he
 For this reason, many governments in developing countries are doing something to encourage and allow foreign investment in international businesses to operate the setup in their respective countries

 The important aspect here is that many governments in emerging economies often welcome international businesses with open arms because of the above reasons
 haalanki, bich main hi prakriya ke madhyam se, unamem se kuch nitigat pakshaaghaat kii vajah se thand pair viksit karne, or karkon se upar soochibaddh he
 It is understandable that allowing international businesses to enter emerging economies needs to be bipartisan meaning that there should be a broad consensus on the issue from all stakeholders
 tabhi to antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee bazaar arthvyavasthaaon main kaamyaab hogi
 In addition, competition for foreign capital is so intense that the process in an adverse economy and therefore, the process must be continued and the reason given incentives affect international businesses

 inamen katyayan, aashvalyan, aapstamb, bodhayan, gautam aadi maharishiyon ke granth aaj bhi uplabdh hai
 
 bhartiya karmkand siddhant kaa pratidaan or samarthan isi darshan main praapt hota he
 Dr
 Kunnan Raja has aptly portrayed this in the role of the second edition of "brihati"
 yadhyapi kanad muni krit vaisheshik darshan main dharm kaa namatah ullekh praapt hota he - tathaapi uske vishay main aage vichaar nahin kiya gaya he
 a scholar says - arthath jaise koi manushya samudr paryant jane kii ichha rakhte hue himalay main chalaa jaataa he, usee prakaar dharm ke vyaakhyaan ke icchhuk kanad muni shat padaarthon kaa vivechan karte rah gaye
 Answer: According to the principle of epistemology, right to attain enlightenment is only after the deed, but according to the earlier epistemology philosophy - is vedamantra ke anusaar mumukshu janon ko bhi karm karnaa chahie
 By performing Vedic Karma, the Karmbandhan is automatically terminated - Tasmanmumukhubhi: Karya is the main soul of Indian theistic philosophies according to the verses of Nityamtikam and “adi”
 mimasaa darshan solah adhyyon kaa he, jisamen baarah adhyay krambaddh hai
 Shastra Sangathi is associated with Adhyatagati, Padasangati and Adhyakanti
 in baarah adhyyon main jo chhot gaya he, uskaa nirupan shesh chaar adhyyon main kiya gaya he jo 'sankarshcand' ke naam se prasiddh he
 It discusses the authority of the deity
 at: use 'devtaa cond' bhi kehete hai athwa dwadash adhyyon kaa parishisht bhi kah sakate hai
 Bhaskar Rai Dixit has written at the end of the interpretation of the Sankarshan case that despite reading Shodasadhyayi Mimamsa, the reading was in Dvadashadhyay only in the medieval period
 jis tarah chatushpada gayatri ke rahane par bhi vidvan varg tripada gayatri ko hi japate hai, usee tarah vartmaan kaal main dwadashadhyaayi mimasaa kaa hi adhyayan adhyaapan prachlit he
 According to some scholars, it is difficult to decide the meaning of a sentence without epistemology, because such a sentence is evidence in the present sense or in other sense, the conclusion which comes in the decision of this idea is called epistemology, but here the meaning of the word epistemology is from philosophy
 is
 dharmagyaan ke liye paraspar virodh rahit vedamantron ke arthon ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 And thoughtfully received theology is the result of epistemology
 yahi baat jaimini ne apane mimasaa darshan main kahi he - athato dharm jigyaasa

 kumaril bhatta ne ise is prakaar varnan kiya he - Further sentence-wise decision-making millennium judgments are described
 yahan tak chah adhyyon kaa sankshipt vishyanirdesh kiya gaya
 In this philosophy, one gets knowledge of duty-abstention from Veda-sentence-decision by considering the objective predicate sentiment obtained from judicious judgment, or from the combustible combustion justice
 isliye dharmagyaan hi mimasaa darshan kaa prayojan he
 In this philosophy there is an undertaking from theology
 vyakaran ke liye "padashastra", vaisheshik nyaay ke liye "pramanshastra" or mimasaa ke liye "vaakyashastra" kaa prayog sanskrit sahitya main hota he
 There is a discussion of religious thought in this scripture
 bhartiya janata kaa mukhya uddeshy dharmanushthan he
 Ritual cannot happen without fruit and fruitfulness cannot be without material means
 at: sankshep main saadhan kaa bhi vivechan kiya jaataa he
 It is necessary to know the symptoms, evidence and means of religion before the ritual
 is shaastra main saadhan, ang or shesh, ye teenon paryaayavachak shabd hai
 Likewise, these three synonyms are Sdhya, Seshi and Angi
 udhaaharan ke liye swargaprapti ke nimitt darsh poornmaas kaa anushthan yadi karnaa ho to usamen darsh or poornmaas angi honge or prayaaj aadi ang honge
 Darsha Yag occurs on Amavasya Tithi and Purnamas Yag occurs on Purnima Tithi
 ) isamen angi pradhan ang kaa prayojak he or ang prayojya he
 In this way, knowing the means of getting the religious ritual requires knowledge of purvaparya as well and in the case of ritualistic agni hotradi karmas for fruits, there is also a discussion of the means of Purvanga and Uttaranga, for which the word "nature" is used
 kintu sauryadi karmke sannidhi main ang kaa paath nahin he
 After the emergence of aspiration at that place, one has to take the organs which are presented in the Darshan Purnamas, which is called as an excess 
 Normally, even if there is a decision, the description of which karma comes in which karma comes, it has been explained by the special instructions
 angon kaa atidesh hone par bhi prakruti main bhed hone ke kaaran praakrit pad ke sthaan par padaantar ko rakhkar paath kiya jaataa he
 For example "agneya tva jushtam nirvapami"
 is shrutivakya main agni pad ke sthaan main "sauryoyeshti" ke suryapad rakhkar "suryaay tvajushta nirvpaami" is shruti ko padhate hai
 Such a sentence is called "ooh"
 in baton ke gyaan bina yah samaj lenaa sambhav nahin he ki kis ang kaa kahan or kaise upyog karnaa chahie jisase anushthan samuchit faldaayak ho sake
 The place where the organ is not read, the organ should be brought from other place, but only those who can do the treatment of deformity can be taken in nature
 jo vikruti main upkaar nahin kar sakate vahaan anya angon kaa adhyaahar nahin hota
 And they do not even have rituals
 aise vachanon ko "baadh" kehete hai
 The decision of which part is obstructed and whose not is subject to "ooh" obstruction
 evam abhipsit faldaata karm ek hi hota he
 But there are many anywhere
 kuch angon kaa anushthan pradhan se purv tathaa kuch kaa pradhan ke pashchaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 For example, Samidheni Prayajadi and a specific follower
 ek hi samay par un angon kaa ek baar athwa anek baar prayog karne ke vishay main kaha gaya he - The name for using once is Tantra and the name for multiple times is "frequency" or "movement"
 kahin kahin angon kaa tantra se anushthan hota he or kahin kahin aavriti se
 Therefore the idea of tantra and movement is also necessary
 kisi fal vishesh ke liye pradhan angi kaa anushthan karte hai or uske angon ko bhi karte hai
 Those organs which require the use of other organs also need to be referred to as context
 isamen pradhan tantri hota he, jise prasang kehete hai
 For example, the Agnostic animal Purodshadi, the perfected person of the aforesaid subjects, can only perform the Sangopang Dharmanasthana, which is explained by Jamini in "mimamsa Darshan"
 is darshan ke prathamadhyay main dharmapramaanon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he or vidhi, arthwaad mantra, smriti, shishtachar, namadhey, sandigdharth nirnaayak vaakyashesh or samathrya kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 In Dwitiyadhyaya, word, practice, number, noun, property and case, these six deeds are proof of distinction
 tritiyadhyaay main shruti, ling, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan or samakhya ye chha: viniojak pramaan hai
 In Chaturvadhyaya, there are six explanatory proofs in Shruti Artha, text, place, main and tendency
 panchmaadhyay main atidesh, pratyakshvachanaatidesh, namatidesh, kalpit vachanaatidesh, ashrayatidesh or sthanpatti atidesh ye saat prakaar ke atidesh hai
 The two distinctions of the end are not mentioned in Saptamadhyaya
 ye indriya kamadhikaran tathaa sthanpatti atidesh main nirupit hai
 The ninth chapter represents three types of "oohs" with the distinction of mantroh, samoah and samskarah
 dashamadhyay main arthlope, pratyamnaay or pratishedh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke baadh kaa nirupan hai
 Ekadasadhyaya has the representation of Tantra and Aavya
 dwadashadhyay main "prasang" kaa nirupan he
 Thus one subject has been rendered in philosophical epistemology philosophy which has also been called "dvadashalini"
 yahan lakshan shabd adhyaywachak he
 It has been divided in two ways, which is called preaching and overtaking
 pratham adhyyon main upadesh kaa vivechan he
 The six chapters of the second describe the overarching narrative
 ukt upadesh atidesh dway vichaaratmak shaastra he
 According to Shastra Deepikaar Parthasarathi Mishra, the beginning of the idea of precept is different from the precept
 vartmaan kaal main uplabdh mimasaa darshan main dwadash adhyay hai
 Each chapter has four legs, but the third, shashtha and tenth chapters have eight pahadas, also known as "shabara" chapters
 is tarah sampurna granth main saath paad hai
 There is controversy in the thread of this philosophy
 kisi ke mat main do sahasr chah sau baawan, kisi ke mat main do sahasr saat sau bayalis sutara hai
 The above description is propounded in the book page four of "aasikit" called "karmamimansa"
 anand ashram puna se prakashit "nyaayamala" main do sahasr saat sau pantalis sutron kaa pratipaadan he
 Similarly, the tribunal number of some persons is nine hundred and seven
 kuch ke mat se nau sau pandrah sutara hai
 But according to Shankar Bhatt, the doer of the "mimamsaar collection", there are five hundred thirty in "purushtak", four hundred and seventy sutras in Uttarashtak
 is prakaar sampurna adhikaran ek sahasr sankhya main vibhajit he
 According to the above verses, the number of tribunals is one thousand two hundred and fifty
 anek sutron se ek adhikaran banataa he, jisamen ek pradhan sutara tathaa anya gun sutara hote hai
 The principal sutra presupposes the antecedent and the other sutras form the principle
 kahin kahin par do sutron ke dwaara purvottar paksh kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 In such a way, the principle has been formulated by raising the former side without the formula
 kahin kahin siddhant rup se upkram dwaara purv paksh kar siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 There are certain tribunals in a foot
 udaahranarth pratham paad main aath adhikaran hai
 The Tribunal has six substances - subject, doubt, antecedent, principle purpose and consistency
 sangati teen prakaar kii hoti he - shaastra sangati, adhyay sangati or paad sangati
 First Sutra - The name of the first tribunal is the curiosity tribunal
 vichaar shaastra vishay he
 There is doubt as to whether or not the idea is worth starting
 aarambh karne yogya nahin he, yah purv paksh he
 The theory is that thought science should be started
 is vishay kaa mul he kumaril bhatta ke mat main adhyayan vidhi or "prabhakar" mat main adhyaapan vidhi
 On the east side there is the invisible purpose of study and in the theory side, the meaning-knowledge-form is the objective view
 dharm ke vichaar shaastra sambandhi hone ke kaaran is vichaar shaastra main iskaa vivechan sangat he
 In this tribunal, study is parable, this has been proved
 atev vichaar shaastra kaa mul adhyayan vidhi he
 The means of semantics is obscured by the study method
 isiilie vichaar shaastra kaa aarambh vaid he
 Second Sutra - The Second Tribunal has the character and proof of religion, whose duty is reflected in the law
 vah shrey kaa saadhan he
 Here the word Shraya means both physical and spiritual meaning
 gamy dharm main gamak vidhivaakya pramaan hota he
 That which is propounded by prohibition is a means of evil, it is called unrighteousness
 tritiy sutara - tritiy adhikaran main vidhi vaakya hi pramaan he
 Only pledge is done here
 ve do prakaar kahi hai - "chodanaiv lakshann yasya, chodana lakshanmev yasya" arthath yahan pratyaksh aadi pramaan dharm se pramaan nahin hote, kintu vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan mana gaya he
 Fourth Sutra - This Sutra has the fourth tribunal to support the first pledge
 is adhikaran main lok siddh pratyaksh pramaan kaa lakshan - "indriarthsannikarshajanyan gyaanan pratyakshm"
 That is, the direct takes on the present approximate and the religion is originating, so there can be no proof in the direct religion, because the religion is future
 in vachanon se mimasaakaar ne pratyakshopjivi anumaan ushmaan or arthapatti ko bhi pramaan nahin mana he
 Pancham Sutra - The fourth sutra is supported by the fifth curse of the fifth sutra by supporting the first curiosity of the fourth tribunal
 is adhikaran main vidhivaakya hi pramaan he, isi pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 In this context, the authenticity of proofs is automatically generated and accepted automatically
 arthath gyanjanak saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or usee saamagree se pramanya gruhit bhi hota he
 Sentences are of two types - cosmic and Vedic
 loukik vaakya paurushey hone ke kaaran purushgat bhram, pramaad, vipralambh, karnapatav aadi dosha se yukt hota he, atev paurushey vaakya pramaan nahin hota
 The mantra is the Brahminical word Veda Apaurusheya
 at: vidhivaakya main apramanya ke kaaran bhramaadi nahin hone se vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan hai
 To support this second promise, the sign of the proof and the relation of the word is continual
 baadaraayan ne bhi pramanya main parapeksha ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 In substance-rendering, there is a relation between matter by word, in scripture-rendering, and in composition by man
 shabd or arth kaa vachya-vaachak-sambandh nity maanakar veda main purush-pravesh kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 That is, the Vedas are penned by the Purusha - the reason for saying this is that we have never heard, read or known the sentences without the person
 jabaki mimasakon ke mat main shabd tathaa uske dwaara pratipaadya ghatapatadi-arth kaa sambandh nity he
 Therefore, 'this verse explains this meaning' - even if we do not know this verse, the verse itself tells its performance
 arthath shaktigrah na hone par bhi pad main pratipaadansamrthy he hi
 And there is a tendency for the authorization to separate the male relation by the syntactic relation
 is adhikaran main yatha pad kii padaarth main shakti hoti he, vaise hi vaakya kii vaakyarth main shakti hoti he, aise jo pratipaadan karte hai uski aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, kyonki pad se upasthit padaarth hi aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti se anvit hokar anshatray vishisht bhaavnarup vaakyarth kaa pratipaadan karata he
 The grammaticalization is governed by the syntactic syntax
 is mat ke anusaar shabdabodh main padaarthon kaa paraspar sambandh sansarg maryaada se bhaasata he
 This is the opinion of the Naiyayikas, which connotes the separation of power in the sentence, but Kumaril Bhatt has supported the designation
 prabhakar ne anvitabhidhan kaa samarthan kiya he
 In this way, the male clause in the sentence is repealed in the second way
 tritiy prakaar granth rachana dwaara hota he
 The reference sentence has a relationship with the man in two ways, one by the katru-karma-bhava-relation and the second by the applied-discourse-bhava-relation
 pravachan sarsaadhaaran or rachana asaadhaaran hoti he
 Is an extraordinary adjective
 atev veda paurushey he
 According to some scholars, the Vedas are called Purusparnait or Pourusheya due to the instructions of man, country, river, tree etc
 in the Vedas, but according to Mimamsa philosophy the discourse is also considered extraordinary
 udaahranarth "kathsamhita" athwa "kath brahman" ke vishay main kinvadanti he ki anek shakha adhyayiyon ke madhya "ksht" maharishi ne purna rup se adhyayan kiya tha
 It is for the second that the name of man, river, etc
 comes in the Vedas, this also proves the Veda Pourusheya, but this imagination is not clever-wise-prescribing; Because often the names of worldly things have come from the Vedas, the tradition of folk-names has gone on from that point of view
 arthath veda itihaas ko anitya nahin maanata, kintu itihaas ke nityatv kaa pratipaadan karata he, iskaa vistrut vivechan mimasaa ke "shabarabhashya" main drushtavy he
 The regular subject and sentence or word are seen in the earliest Brahmarsigan Samadhi, so the Vedas do not include the image of the forefathers
 " loukik rachanaayen purush vishesh kartrutv hone ke kaaran paurushey hai, yatha mahabharat, ramayana aadi
 According to Kumaril Bhatt, the study tradition is eternal
 atev veda bhi apaurushey hai
 Such tribunal principle cannot be related to justice only through the creation of Vedas, hence the sentence is the proof in religion
 mimasaa-darshan main aatm-tatv kaa pratipadak koi bhi moulik sutara nahin he
 Although Shankaracharya wrote that "pre-tantra" does not contain self-effulgent formulas, he has described the form of self by saying this utterance, in Uttamimamsa's "an Evatman: Sharire Bhavat"
 vrittikaar mat ko pramaan rup se uddhrut karte hue likhaa he : "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvan tathaa sharirake vakshyam:"
 The idea is that Purvimamsa, like Uttara Mimamsa, is formed by believing the Advaita soul, however, Purvimamsa is practiced only by considering the subject-subservient self-realization in addition to the body, because Karma-siddhanta consists of "gratitude" and "inattention
" or yaheen se punarjanm aadi kii siddhi bhi hoti he
 "chodna Resume:" "satsamprayogay Purushyendriyamam" Atmabija is rendered from both these sutras
 or vapan aadi sanskaar fali kaa sanskaar he
 In Purusharth, the soul gets fruit from the word Yajna and Krit Yag with the word Purush
 shabar swami ne sutara vishesh ke bina hi "yagyaayudh vaakya" ko nimitt maanakar anaatmavaadi ke mat kaa khandan karte hue aatmaswaroop ko tark or shrutiyon ke dwaara siddh kiya he jisase veda pramanya kii bhi siddhi hoti he
 In post-epistemology, the soul is considered one; But in "samkhya Yoga", justice, vahesika, and premeditation, the soul is considered many, which through karma is related to body, sense and mind
 atev sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandha kaha gaya he
 The above triad puts the soul in bondage, so that the soul suffers a pleasant face: Khadi duality
 nity naimitthik karmon ko katrtavya buddhaya karte hue praarabdh karmon ko jeev bhogata rahata he
 Apart from the body sense, the person who worships the soul with the Brahman intellect has no reason for connection with the sense body, etc
 Such a person becomes self-possessed after the destruction of the present body
 uttarmimasaa ke anusaar sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandhan kaha gaya he jo agyaan kaa kaaran he; uski nivritti hi moksh he
 For example - " nivritiratma mohasy gyatatvenoplakshith: The foreshadowing also accepts that the relation of body, senses and subjects is bondage, and its merger is salvation, whose means, knowledge and action are combined
 atmagyaan do prakaar kaa hota he
 Sharatritik is part of the season of enlightenment, which is free from harmony
 vaidic or loukik vaakyon kaa sahasron kii sankhya main vaakyarth nirnyopayogi nyaayon kaa purvamimasaa ne hi pratipaadan kiya he
 Therefore, the first place in Indian philosophies is that of karma exponent of premodern philosophy
 uttarmimasaa agyaan se sristi or atmagyaan se sristi kaa vinaash maanata he
 Justice, Vaiseshika philosophy has called the destruction of the Mahakrishti till Mahakruti and the destruction of the nuclear atom by Mahabhutla in the double order
 arthath sampurna bhav kaary dvanukadi kram se utpann hote hai or sthool se parmaanu paryant jaakar nasht ho jate hai
 The five atoms of earth, water, light and air are continual in the Panch Mahabhutas
 akaash swayan hi nity he, kintu purv mimasaa ke anusaar do prakaar kii sristi or teen prakaar ke pralay hote hai, jinamein mahasrishti or khand sristi shabd se do sristi kahi gai he
 Three dooms have been called in the same way with the words Pralaya, Mahapralaya and Khanda Pralaya
 unamem khand sristi or khand pralay aajkal ke samaan hi mana gaya he
 For example, a particular site gets destroyed due to earthquake etc
 and somewhere new things are created
 mahasrishti main parmaanuon se dvanukadi dwaara panchmahabhoot paryant navagrahadikon kii sristi hoti he, jiskaa ullekh rugveda ke dasham mandal main praapt hota he - In Matsyapuranadi, one also gets a description of the status of the substances present under the block catastrophe, but former epistemology does not accept Mahasruti and Mahapralaya
 uske anusaar sabhi padaarthon ke naash main koi bhi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 As the narrator has said - mimasaa darshan khand sristi or khand pralay ko hi maanata he
 In Indian six-believer philosophies, the seekers of justice, Vaiseshika and Vedanta are often the same
 udaahranarth "yato vaa imani bhutani jaayante", "dyavabhumi janayan dev ek:" "vishwasya katrta bhuvnsy gopta" in shrutiyon ke dwaara or "janmadyasya yat:" is vedant sutara ke dwaara ishwar kii siddhi hoti he
 Similarly, God has also been proved by the "kshitankuradik Kartajranya Karyavat Ghatavat" conjecture in the jurisprudence, but the Vedantis have proved God by the Shrutis as their cooperative reason
 or naiyayikon ne anumaan se ishwar ke siddh kar shrutiyon ko sahakaari kaaran mana he
 There are two views in Sankhya philosophy - Sesvara and Nirishwar
 seshwar sankhyavaadee ishwar ko maanate hai, kintu use purush vishesh shabd se vyavhaar karte hai
 The Niraश्वरvara Samāhākāvī करतेa denies God, "but the science monk has accepted God by referring to the verse" Ishvarasiddhe: "in this sutra as" proof
 mimasaa darshan naiyayikon ke samaan vidhi mukh se ishwar kaa samarthan ar nirishwar sankhyavaadiyon ke samaan nishedh bhi nahin karata, kintu "sambandhakshepaprihaar" granth main kumaril bhatta ne shabdaarth ke sambandh kaa karta ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he
 The idea is that the subject of the relationship is not God
 uparyukt vachanon ko sweekaar kar lokprasiddhi he ki mimasak nirishvaravaadi he
 The commentators like Kumaril Bhatt, Nandishwar etc
 have disposed of the supposed God and accepted the Vedasiddha God
 vastutah mimasaa veda se siddh brahm athwa ishwar ko sweekaar karata hi he
 Because the Mimamsa philosophy considers the Veda to be an automatic proof
 mimasaa kaa purvamimasaa ar veydantka uttarmimasaa naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, the principle of Vedanta's philosophy and the principles of Vedanta are valid, it is clear
 vedavihit yagadi karm dravya or devtaa in do se saadhy hai
 The substance is Dadhyadi and the deity is Shastraka Samadhigamgya
 arthath vidhi vaakya jisko devtaa kahata he use hi devtaa mana jaataa he
 Here three aspects about the deity have been accepted in Dasamadhyay's Chaturthpad and in Shabar Bhashya etc
 texts
 arth devtaa, shabd vishisht arth devtaa or shabd devtaa hai
 The last aspect in all three is the principle, because the meaning is remembered by the word
 atev shabd kii pratham upasthiti hone ke kaaran shabd hi devtaa mana gaya he
 For example, in the words "indraya Swaha, Takkshakaya Swaha", these fourth terms Indraya and Takshkaya are deities
 arth ko devtaa sweekaar karne vaale vyakti bhi shabd kii upeksha nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, due to the predominance of the word in all the three sides, the Mimansakas have accepted the word as the deity
 yahan par ek niyam he - vidhi vaakya main jo devatavachak shabd he uskaa aavahan, tyaag or sookt vaakya aadi main uccharan karnaa chahie, na ki uske paryaayavachi shabdon ko
 For example, the word "jatvedas", synonymous with fire, should not be used in "agnayamashtakapalam"
 ukt baton se vidit hota he ki "shabdamayi devtaa" hi mimasaa darshan kaa siddhant he
 The idea of vigrahadi Sadasad bhava of the deity - Vigrahadi five of the deity etc
 are considered in this philosophy
 arthath vigrah, havish, bhoga, aishwarya, prasannataa or faldaatrutiv ye paanch vigrah kahe jate hai
 On the basis of the above promise, Vedantis have considered Vigrahadi five forms of the deity
 abhipraay yah he ki manushya aadi ke samaan hi kar, charan aadi avyav devataaon ke bhi hote hai, ve havish sweekaar karte hai, bhakshan karte hai or prasann hokar yajmaan ko fal dete hai
 Hence the deity is vigrahadimana
 uparyukt vichaar hi yask maharishi ne "nirukt" ke "athaakaar chintanam" vaakya se purushvigrahata ko siddh kiya he
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, "shabdmayi Deity" has been endorsed, but Shabar Swamy has denied the Deity Deity in his best deity authority
 praaia: parthasarathi, khandadev aadi sabhi vidwaanon ne isi maarg kaa avlamban kiya he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne apni tikaa main devtaa ko pradhan na maanakar dravya ke samaan use ang mana he or karm ko hi pradhanthya sweekaar kiya he tathaa kaha he ki karm hi fal detaa he
 No one pleads with the slave while the master is
 karmana phaljanakatvan tathaa shabdamayi devtaa, ukt dway siddhanton kaa samarthan devtaa vigrahadi ko maanakar anya mimasakon ne kiya he
 The deity of the commentary Shabar should be addressed with despotism
 atev purvamimasaa "shabdamayi devtaa" ko hi swikar karata he
 His knowledge, Tadhit, Chaturthi Vibhakti and Mantravan are from these three
 keval inamen paraspar antar yah he ki taddhit shakti kii aavriti se devtaa k bodhan karata he
 Chaturthi explains the Vibhakti symptoms and Mantravarna installations
 mimasaadarshan ne apni karmparakata kii drushti se ukt prakaar se devtaa kaa karm kaa ang mana he
 In fact, the deity is untapped
 nirukt vedang he ar mimasashastra vedapang he
 Therefore, in the context of Vedic deity philosophy, it is necessary to consider the interpretation of the Nirukta as independent and the main deity philosophy
 vaakyon ke dwaara jo bodh hota he use vaakyarth bodh yaa shaabd bodh kehete hai
 The sentence is also a statement - subantachay: vaakyam, tingantayovakyam, suptingntchayo vaakyam
 There are three aspects in it, which should have a causative verb
 amarkosh ke anusaar - "tid
subant chayo vaakyan kriya vaa karkanvita"
 That is, the causative verb of subant and tingant sentences is ejaculatory
 purvamimasaa main kumaril bhatta, prabhakar or murari ke teen mat prasiddh hai, kintu antim main "tripad niti nayan" is naam se khyath granth bhi vidit hua he
 There are two famous departures in the minds of the nominees, Anointedism and Anuvitabhidhanism
 inamen pratham kumaril bhatta or dwitiya prabhakar kaa mat he
 In the Shabdha sense, the sentiment is mainly accepted by Bhatt
 prabhakar ne kaary ko mukhya sweekaar kiya he
 The meaning of the term 'abhidhyataya' means that the substance enlightened by the terms integrates the aspiration, ability and attachment and makes it literal through the signs
 nyaayamat main padon kii padaarth main shakti he or pad gyaan lakshan yaa bodh karte hai
 The positions lead to the presence of matter
 isi prakaar mimasaa main kaha gaya he, udaahranarth jyotishtoman swarg kaamo yajet"
 Here "yajet" has two passages - "yaj" metal and "ta" suffix
 pratyay aakhyaatansh ko lekar aarthi bhaavana kaa pratipaadan karata he
 That feeling has three aspirations - Sādhyākāक्षाa साधa Sādhanākā औरa and "ityākāyātakābakक्षाa"
 saadhyaakanksha hone par swarg kaa saadhyatven anvay hota he
 When there is sadhana, the cause of Dhatworth is unknown
 
 It is an ambivalence that occurs when there is a duty
 vaakyarthaadhikaran main kaha gaya he- The sentence is used in the world to understand the specific meaning
 padashravan se padaarthon kaa pruthak pruthak gyaan hota he
 This is for reading, but the substance that is not intended to the listener and the sentence for which the sentence is used is not the function of the listener, in such a place the meaning of sentence is unacceptable
 atev anupapatti ke nivaranarth lakshana maani gai he
 All philosophers have accepted epigraphy as the seed of symptoms
 padon ke do prakaar ke taatpary maane gaye hai, pratham taatpary tathaa dwitiya mahataatpary
 The first difference refers to the subject matter, and the great phrase implies the subject
 abhihitanvayavaad main vaakya se vaakyarth kaa bodh lakshanya hota he
 Kumaril Bhatt has rendered with the following verses - is vachan se bhatta padka abhihitanvayavaad kaa swaroop digdarshit hota he
 Some scholars state that "ananavitavastha" matter is designated by matter
 unki anvitavastha keval lakshith hoti he
 Thus "anubhitabhidhanism" belongs to Kumaril Bhatt, but what Bhatta's translation translates as Anubhibhidhanism, is not appropriate, because the above article is not discussed anywhere in his texts
 anvitabhidhan shabd kaa yah arth he - pad anvitarth bodhan karte hai
 Therefore, by the power of verse, both the substance and the sentence are realized
 pad shakti se atirikt lakshana aadi maanane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The veteran uses the word to carry an object
 uske paas kaa balak us shabd ko shravan kar ou duusare purush ke le aane or le jane kaa kaary karte dekhakar shabd kaa arth samaj letaa he
 This is the working reason of the trend
 lok main kriya ko bhi kaary samajha jaataa he, usee prakaar veda main bhi yagadi kriya ko prathmat: kaary samajha jaataa he
 Yagadi activity is transient and heaven is eternal in future
 atev ukt veda vaakya vimarsh se yagatirikt "apurv, naamak vastu samajhi jaati he
 Here, the aforesaid two powers of "one work word" have to be accepted in two meanings
 ek main shakti or duusare se lakshana manani hoti he
 It also has special power in supernatural work, as is prevalent among scholars - lok main kriya rup kaary main lakshana hoti he
 In the Vedas, verses are sentences, and substance is a sentence
 is mat main vaakyarth, anvay or sansarg ye sab paryaay hai
 That is, the unknown is the instrument in the unknown
 prabhakar ne graahak grahan ko mana he, usase bhi anvitabhidhanwaad siddh hota he
 In this opinion - "yajet Swargakam:" This sentence gives the literal meaning of Anavitabhidhan
 is darshan main swargaprapti ke liye yag kaa hi vidhaan he
 The meaning of heaven is this - one who does not suffer from sorrow and there is no possibility of causing sorrow and to fulfill the desire, it is called heaven
 "dashampoornamasabhyaan swargakaamo yajet" ityadi vaakyon dwaara darshapurnmaas yag se swarg ke saadhan kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 Yag is considered ephemeral, as Yag is the name of the sacrifice of matter for the purpose of a deity
 "indray idan na mam" is vaakya se maanas vyapaar kaa tyaag hota he
 That business is destroyed in that moment
 niratishay priti vishay ko swarg kaha gaya he
 It is obtained in the period of time or birth
 yah darshan shaastra kaa niyam he, kayontpatti ke avyavhit purv kshan main kaaran ko rahanaa chahie or kshanik yag janmaantar bhavi swargotpatti ke avyavhit purvakshan main sambhav nahin he
 Thus, according to the above Shruti, the attainment of Yag, the means of heaven or the succession of Yag and the precession of the fruit, these are all proved to be an object, which is called extravagance, apurva, or merit
 iskaa vistrut vivechan kumaril bhatta ne apurvaadhikaran main yuktipurvak kiya he
 The man before Yaganushthan does not have the ability to consume heaven
 anushthan ke purv yag main bhi swargadi fal dene kii yogyata nahin hoti evam purush kii ayogyata tathaa karm kii ayogyata kaa niraakaran kar shastragamya samathrya ab vaa atishayyogyata ko apurv mana gaya he
 As ise adhikarapurv athwa falapurv kehete hai
 Where there is only one principal, the incomparable that arises from the principal Yag is called antecedent
 angon se jo apurv utpann hota he, use angaporesv kehete hai
 Both Angaapurava and Pradhanpuram together produce the Holiness
 usase swargadi fal kii prapti hoti he
 Some yagas bear fruit from many heads
 udaahranarth - darsh main teen yag hote hai or paurnmaas main bhi teen yag hote hai
 Here one community pre-arises from the three antecedents arising from the three princes
 donon samudayapurvon se ek parmapurv utpann hota he
 It is meant that in the first example above, three are considered unique
 dwitiya udhaaharan main utpatypurv, angaporesv, samudayapurv or falapurv, chaar apurv maane jate hai
 It is the servants of all the Muslims
 isamen bhatt mimasak shabar bhashya 2
 1
 2 ke "yagen apurv kruthva swarg bhavayet" anusaar shabd se tathaa shrutarthapatti se apurv kii siddhi karte hai
 And consider it to be the main feature in Lingadi's speech and vocabulary
 sabhi darshanikon ke dwaara apurv kaa jo khandan kiya gaya he vah vachyatvansh or praadhanyansh kaa hi khandan he
 Four categories have been considered for philosophy in philosophy - pramaan prameya pramiti pramaata
 Proof - Proof is that which has a definite knowledge of the subject and the determination of the subject
 prameya - pramaan ke dwaara jiskaa gyaan ho use prameya kehete hai
 Pramiti - Any subject that has definite knowledge through proof, is called pramiti
 pramaata - pramaan ke dwaara prameya gyaan ko jo jaanata he - use pramaata kehete hai
 Here various Indian philosophers have given a dual idea about knowledge - gyaan kaa pramanya swat: grahya he athwa parat: grahya he
 Mimansak, Vedanti and Buddhists come in the automatic category
 parat: koti main nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, jain or charvak aate hai
 Here, from the word 'authentic', one should understand the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, rather than the knowledge of the nature of knowledge
 chodanalakshanodharm: sutara main - "nanu atthabhootampyarth bruyat chodana" ityadi bhashya se arthtathatv hi vivakshit he
 "tchcha abadhitatvam, Arthanrutho dharma special :, tasya gyanen nirupranat"
 chaudnaa sutara ke bhashya "atathatv bhootan arth" se abaadhitiv arthnishth dharm vivakshit he, jiskaa nirupan gyaan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, pramanya is called jnanamanthi
 vah parat: utpann or parat: gruhit hota he
 This is the doctrine of barbarians
 arthath jis saamagree se gyaan utpann hota he, usase pramanya utpann na hokar anya saamagree se utpann hota he evam jisase gyaan grahit hota he, usase pramanya gruhit na hokar anya gun gyanadi se gruhit hota he
 From this it came to be that authenticity arises from material other than knowledgeable material and knowledge is authenticated by content other than customer content
 is mat main pramanya or apramanya donon parat: hote hai
 This is a routine consensus review
 uparyukt mat main mimasak log anavastha dosha bataate hai jisase gyaanamat pramanya kabhi siddh nahin ho saktaa
 That is, public behavior will be broken
 at: gyaanagat pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 The idea is that the content from which knowledge is produced, the same material also produces credibility; And the material with which knowledge is acquired, the same material is recognized
 yahi swat:pramanyawaadee mimaskadikon kaa pramanya kaa swatastv he, jiskaa kumaril bhatta ne apane granth bhatt vaarthik main anek yuktiyon se samarthan kiya he - Knowledge is permissible here in Bhattmat
 gyaan ke vishay main kuch atishay utpann hota he jisase "gyatoghat:" yah anubhav hota he
 From this, a religion called knownness arises in the subject of Ghatadi, which is called by the words Prakatyam, Bhasanam, Prakash
 isse yah aayaa ki gyatata lingak anumaan se gyaan kaa grahan hota he
 This is also the eclipse of authenticity
 prabhakar mat main gyaan swayan prakaash he
 Therefore, knowledge leads to enlightenment
 atev swat: pramanya donon maton main samaan he, jiskaa vivechan "shloke vaarthik", "prakaran panjika", "nyaay ratnamala" main vistrut rup se kiya gaya he
 The method of interpreting sentences of eternal meaning from direct inference is called method
 arthath agyatagyapak apravritapravartak jo vaakya hai uskaa naam "vidhi" he
 There are two sides of the mindset with respect to the pupil - one considers the propagation as the pupil
 isamen praayash: sabhi mimasak aa jate hai
 The second one considers the work to be complete
 yah prabhakar kaa siddhant he
 This side produces this type of - lok main pravartak purush, acharya athwa raja apane shishy athwa bhrity ko pravrutt karaane ke liye "gammanay" ityadi vaakya kaa prayog karte he
 a disciple or devotee, listening to the said sentence, researches its meaning
 pashchaat "gavaanayan" aadi kaary main pravrutt hota he
 Therefore, the motive of promoter man is special, it is called Vidhyarth in the world
 vah purush kii kriya he jo purush main rahati he
 Hence, it is also called Purushabhipraya
 veda apaurushey hone ke kaaran vaidic lingadi kaa arth purushabhipraay nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hence, the word Lingadi is used in place of a man
 uskaa vyaparvishesh hi vidhyarth he
 Being literate, it is also called Shabdi Bhavna
 iskaa lakshan is prakaar kiya gaya he "purushapravrityanukool: pravartak lingadinishtho vyaparvishesh: shabdi bhaavana"
 In the scriptures, it has been called the introduction, inspiration, etc
 lok main pravriti do prakaar kii hoti he - pratham apni ichha se purush pravrutt hota he
 The second promoter is the person, or person, by word, which is called "inspiration
" jahaan prerana ke pashchaat pravriti hoti he, vahaan pravartan gyaan hi pravartak mana jaataa he, jise mandan mishra, parthasarathi prabhruti vidwaanon ne "ishtsaadhan" mana he
 Justice Sudhakar has considered it to be a special supernatural religion
 prabhakar mishra ne pravriti ke prati kaaryatagyaan ko kaaran mana he, jisase ishtsaadhanatv aadi akshipt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, "chodna Sympto Religion:" is written in the sutra - "acharya Chodit" Karomi "while explaining this commentary, Shaliknath has said - Chodit: Promoted:, Karyambhavadh: Itartha, Karyagayana without Pravrittarasamvadhitti" Therefore Prabhakar is said in the opinion
 Is - "karya vidyarthi:, tachya karya dhatvarthatiabharatam, Apoorva word vachyam tadeva vidyartha eti" veda vaakyarth nirnay ke liye pravrutt mimasaa darshan main chaar prakaar kii vidhi kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he - Origin: The sentence by which the nature of karma is primarily known, is called genesis method
 udaahranarth "agnihotran juhoti" is vaakya se agnihotra naamak home se isht ko praapt karnaa arth hota he
 Appropriation method: The method by which the relation of the organ is known is known as appropriation
 udaahranarth "dadhna juhoti" is vaakya se dahi se havan karne kaa arth bodhit hota he
 It has Dadhi means and Home is practicable
 yahan viniyog vidhi main viniyog shabd se sambandh ko samajhnaa chahie
 That relationship ends in the practicable means, the angangi or the remaining
 prayogvidhi : jo pradhan or ang ke anushthan main kram kaa bodh karaata he use prayogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, heaven is attained by the Yajna, the principal worshiper of the Prayasadi organ
 isi abhipraay se lakshan kiya gaya he "angaanaan krambodhako vidhi; prayogvidhi:" Adhikavidhi: The method by which the karta of the karmajni fruit is regarded as the doer is called the Adhikavidhi
 udaahranarth "yajet swarg kaam:" yahan jo yagakarta he vahi swargfal kaa bhokta he
 In the same way, three types of methods are famous with distinction between Apoorva law, Rule method and Parvakhya method - upar vidhiyon ke do prakaar bataae gaye hai, use is prakaar samajhnaa chahie ki apurvavidhi main utpatti, viniyog prayog or adhikaar vidhi chaaron antargat hote hai
 Rule and number law is within the appropriation method itself
 is vishay kaa vishesh gyaan bhatt chintamani main drashtavy he
 2040 BCE represents the years before the birth of Christ

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus

 The Tata Nano is the most innovative car manufactured by Tata Motors
 yah vishwa kii sabase sasti car he jiskaa daam 1 lakh bhartiya rupee he
 The media mostly referred to it as Lakhtakia Kar
 isaki bikri june 2008 se prarambh hogi
 Ratan Tata, while presenting the car 'nano' to the public, assured that the price of this car will be Rs one lakh as promised and it meets all the safety and pollution levels
 tata ne maaruti 800 ko apni pariyojna ke liye nishaanaa banaaya jisane kareeb do dashak tak bhartiya bazaar par raaj kiya or unhone aisi car banaai jo lambaai main aath fisadi choti lekin andar se 21 fisadi zyaada jagah vaali he
 In view of the ongoing controversy in Singur, West Bengal, Tata Motors has decided to stop the work of the Nano plant there
 company ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki pichley kai dinon se hinsak tareeke se karmchaariyon ko kaam par aane se roka ja rahaa tha or karmchaariyon or mazaduron kii suraksha ko dekhte hue ye faisalaa liya gaya he
 According to Tata Motors, the idea is to move the Nano plant to an alternate location
 company kii ore se ye bhi kaha he ki pashchim bengal ke kai log naino plant main kaam kar rahe the or koshish kii jaaegi ki unhen duusari jagah bhi naukari par rakhaa jaae
 "A spokesperson for Tata Motors said," The situation around the Nano plant is not good
 jab tak maahaul makul nahin banataa hamen samarthan nahin miltaa, plant kaa kaam sucharu rup se nahin chal saktaa
 We had come to West Bengal thinking that we would be able to provide employment and bring prosperity to the state
 pichley kuch samay se singur main naino plant kisi na kisi mushkil main ghira rahaa he
 No work has been done at the plant since 28 August 2008

 lekin trinmul congress 2006 se hi is pariyojna kaa virodh karti ai he

 Regarding the tendency, instinct and custom, based on an interesting story, Rajasekhar states that his Priya Sahityaadwadhu used to wear unique costumes, quirky luxuries and new innovative utterances in different regions of the country while exploring the poetry
