 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race

 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea

 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians

 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians

 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia

 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture

 bioshock is a haunted first-person shooter video game developed by Irrational Games — then named 2K Boston / 2K Australia — and is designed by Ken Levine
 is khel ko vindos oparating system or exbox 360 video game consol ke liye 21 agast 2007 ko uttari america main tathaa iske teen dinon baad europe or australia main release kiya gaya
 a playstation 3 version of the game, developed by Marin 2, was released internationally on October 17, 2008 and in North America on October 21, 2008, with some additional features
 21 agast 2007 ko yah steam par uplabdh hua
 On October 7, 2009, the game was also released for the Mac OS x operating system
 mobile plateform ke liye is khel kaa ek sanskaran abhi aiji fan dwaara viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 Its next part, Bioshock 2, was released on 9 February 2010
 1960 ke ek vaikalpik itihaas par aadhaarit is khel main khilaadi ek vimaan haadase main jivit bache jaik naamak vyakti kii bhoomika main hota he, jiske liye rapchar naamak jalmagn shahar kii khoj karnaa or us shahar main rahane vaale utparivartit jeevon tathaa chaalakahin masini vayuyanon ke hamalon se bachanaa aavashyak hota he
 The game contains elements found in role-playing and defense-games, and the developers and Levine have cited it as a "spiritual follow-up" to their previous titles of the System Shock series
 is khel ne jabardast sakaaratmak pratikriyaayein praapt kin, jinamein isaki "naitikta-aadhaarit" patakatha, nimajjan purna vaataavaran or ain rand se prerit manahoosiyat par aadhaarit katha kii prashansa kii gai thi
 bioshock is a first-person shooter game with elements specifically designed for role-playing and secret elements and is similar to System Shock 2
 khilaadi jaik kii bhoomika nibhaataa he, jiskaa lakshya apane uddeshyon kii purti ke liye hathiyaaron tathaa plasmid kaa prayog karke ladate hue rapchar tak pahunchane vaale maarg par aage badhate janaa he
 On some occasions, the player may also use confidential tricks to avoid being detected by security cameras and automatic bastions
 rapchar kii khoj karte hue, khilaadi dhan ekatra karata he, jiskaa prayog vibhinn vending mashiinon par hathiyaar, swasthya or atirikt upkaran paane main kiya ja saktaa he
 The player also gets some open parts, which can be used to manufacture new weapons or disposable items on "u-invent" machines
 camere, burj, tijoriyaan, kuch taale or vending mashine aadi sabhi khilaadi ke laabh ke liye hack kii ja saktin hai, jinase khilaadi ke shatruon ko sakriy karne, unki vastuon kii jaankaree khilaadi ko dene athwa khilaadi ko chhot ke saath vasteen kharidne jaise laabh praapt hote hai
 For hacking, the player has to complete a short game like pipe mania in a limited time
 khel kii shuruyaat main khilaadi ko ek "khoji camera" diya jaataa he, jisaki sahaayta se jaik apane shatruon kii tasviren khinch kar unka vishleshan kar saktaa he, jisamen behatar gunvattta vaali tasviren adhik laabhadaayak vishleshan pradaan karatin hai
 After sufficient analysis of an enemy, the player is given more damage, gen tonic, and other bonuses when faced with that type of enemy in future battles
 shishe kii deevaaron se bane "vita-chembar" bhi puure khel ke dauraan dekhe ja sakate hai, jinka prayog khilaadi pratyaksh rup se nahin karata
 Instead, if Jack dies, his body is rebuilt to the nearest chamber, after which all his objects are retained, but only a portion of his full health remains
 is khel ke ek bhaag main, khilaadi ke paas in vita-chembaron ke prayog ko niskriy karne kaa vikalp hota he, taaki yadi jaik kii maut ho jaati he, to khilaadi ko kisi sanchit khel se punah prarambh karnaa hoga
 The player can collect and assign multiple plasmids and gene tonics, which give Jack the ability to uncover special attacks or provide some indirect benefits such as improved health or hacking skills
 "sakriy" plasmid-ve jinhen khilaadi dwaara sarvaadhik aakraamak plasmidon ke rup main prarambh kiya gaya ho- ke liye eve serum kii kuch maatra ko jaadui ankon ke samaan prayog karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he; eve ko sirinjon ke madhyam se punah bharaa ja saktaa he
 These plasmids also alter the appearance of the player, reflecting "sacrificing one's own humanity"
 "tonic" apratyaksh plasmid hote hai or unka laabh praapt karne ke liye kisi eve kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti; khilaadi kisi bhi samay plasmidon va tonicon kii ek simit maatra se hi sajjit ho saktaa he
 The game encourages the use of a creative combination of plasmids, weapons, and the use of environments
 puri patakatha main plasmid shahar main kuch vishisht binduon par ekatrit kiye ja sakate hai, lekin khilaadi dwaara adhikanshtah unhen little sisters se praapt adam mutajin kaa prayog karke "gaidrars gardens" main kharida jaataa he
 In order to collect Adam Mutagen, the player must first defeat the "big Daddy" —a biologically advanced man who is paired with an armored diving suit — who lives with and defends each Little Sister
 We do
 iske baad khilaadi ke paas ek naitik vikalp hota he: yaa to vah bahut sara adam paane ke liye little sistar kii hatya kar de, yaa phir little sistar kii jaan bachaa le or keval ek thodi maatra praapt kare, haalanki prayek teen bahanon ko bachaane par puraskaar ke rup main khilaadi ko adam kii ek badi maatra di jaati he
 While both options have their benefits, this element of conflict between moral values has an impact on the script and, inter alia, the rigors of the entire game
 bioshock ko 1960 ke daur kii prishthbhumi main, rapchar naamak ek jalmagn manahuus kaalpanik shahar main, banaaya gaya he
 As the player explores the city during the game, he gets to know the history of Rapture through audio recording
 rapchar kii kalpana amir vyapaaree andrew rayaan ne kii thi, jo bhoomi par lagaataar badhate rajnatik, aarthik or dharmik praadhikaar se bachane ke liye ek ahastkshep-rajya kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate the
 The city was secretly built in 1946 in the mid-atlantic seabed, receiving geothermal electric power from volcanoes located deep in the water
 rapchar main vaigyanik pragati aage badhati rahi, jiske kaaran ejineering or jaevpraudyogiki main teevr gati se vikaas hua, jiskaa kuch shrey rayaan dwaara shahar main laaye gayi budhimaan vaigyanikon ko jaataa he
 One such advancement was stem cells produced from Adam, a pre-known species of sea snail, which was discovered by Dr
 Bridget Tenenbom to develop the ability to reconstruct damaged tissues and rewrite the human genome
 vyavsaayee or gunde frank fontan ke saath milakar tennenbom ne plasmid udyog kaa nirmaan kiya, jo apane upabhoktaaon ko ati-maanviya shaareerik vruddhi pradaan karata tha
 Tenenbom found that if the snail was developed in the stomachs of young girls, taken from the orphanages established by Fontaine, then Adam could be produced on a large scale
 samay ke saath-saath amiron or garibon ke bich kii khai badhati gai
 Frank Fontaine founded charitable organizations to help the poor
 uske uddeshy paroapkaar se koson dur the; apane dharmarth sanghathanon kaa prayog garibon ke shoshan ke liye karnaa uskaa mul lakshya tha
 He also founded a smuggler gang, from the surface that supplied banned goods, such as religious materials, to citizens
 in sabhi ne or plasmid udyog par uske niyantran ne, use bahut adhik shaktishaalee bana diya
 He tries to overthrow Ryan, but the rebellion is ruthlessly crushed and reports that Fontaine has been killed
 rayaan ne fontan ke plasmid vyapaar par kabza kar liya
 Within a few months, a character named Atlas emerged as a disgruntled lower-class leader
 1959 ke nav-varsh kii purv sandhya par, atlas or uske adam-prabhavit anuyaayiyon ne rayaan ke khilaaf ek naye vidroh kii shuruyaat kar di, jo puure rapchar main fail gaya
 In response, Ryan began to add his own forces and his persecution had reached such a level that he hanged dozens of people, most of whom were innocent, at Rapture's main square
 adam kii kami se nipatane ke liye, little sisters kii maansik sthiti is prakaar kii banaai gai ki ve shahar main ghumkar mrit vyaktiyon se adam nikaal len or use nigalane ke baad apane pet main kachche adam ke rup main ise punarchakrit karen
 Scientist Dr
 Suchong, the creator of several plasmids, created "big Daddies", sophisticated and mentally observant humans wearing armed diving suits, to protect them in their work as Little Sisters
 adam kii ek kami yah he ki yadi prayokt niyamit rup se iskaa seven na kare, to vah maansik or shaareerik vikaar se grasit ho jaataa he
 As production and supply were disrupted due to the war, each user of Adam in the city eventually became violently hysterical
 jis samay tak khilaadi kaa pravesh hota he, tab tak keval kuch hi gaiyr-parivartit manushya morcheband thikaanon par shesh bache hote hai
 At the beginning of the game, the player Jack is an aircraft passenger who sinks into the Atlantic Ocean in 1960, following the collapse of Rapture's social order
 sataha par pahunchane par, jaik paata he ki keval vah akelaa hi is durghatana main jivit bachaa he or vah tairkar ek dweep par sthit nikatatam prakaash-stambh tower kii ore pahunchataa he, jahaan use ek krodmandal miltaa he, jiskaa prayog karke vah mahaasaagar kii gaharaai main jaakar rapchar shahar main pravesh karata he
 An Irish man named Atlas helps Jack to reach a safe place using the service radio found in the Cromodandle
 is bich, jaik ko sataha par sthit kisi desh kaa agent maanakar rayaan rapchar kii swachaalit pranaaliyon or uske pheromone-niyantrit spliceron kaa prayog karke jaik kii hatya karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Atlas tells Jack that using the abilities provided by the plasmids is the only way for him to survive and that he must kill them to gain the Adam of the Little Sisters
 sanyogvash dow tennenbom atlas ke shabdon ko sun leti hai or little sisters ko maarane ke bajaay unki raksha karne kaa nivedan karte hue use ek plasmid detii hai, jo ki prayek sistar main antahsthapit samudri ghonghe ko sthanantarit kar degaa
 Atlas states that his wife and child are hidden in a submarine and sends Jack towards him
 jaise hi jaik or atlas us khadi tak pahunchate hai, jahaan yah khadi he, tabhi rayaan ise nasht kar detaa he; cruddh atlas jaik se rayaan kii hatya karne ko kahata he
 After completing tasks such as saving an artificial forest from being destroyed and assisting the unconscious artist to create an idol, Jack eventually encounters him in Ryan's office, playing golf comfortably
 rayaan use ek sachai bataata he, jo ki usne kai tukdon ko ek saath jodakar banaai he
 In fact, Jack was born only two years ago at Rapture and was genetically altered so that he matured quickly
 vah rayaan kaa avaidh putr he, jiskaa janm jasmin jolin naamak ek nartki ke saath pranay-sambandh ke kaaran hua he
 When Jolene became pregnant and Jack was in her womb, due to an extreme need for money, she extracted her fetus through arms and sold it to the highest bidder
 use yah ahsaas nahin tha ki uske putr ko kharidne vaala vyakti frank fontan he, jiske parinamswaroop krodhit rayaan ne uski hatya kar di
 Ryan further states that after purchasing Jack's fetus, Fontaine designed her to follow orders beginning with a specific phrase "could you please


"
 phir yuddh shuru ho jane par rayaan kii pahunch se jaik ko bachaane ke liye use sataha par bhej diya gaya
 When the confrontation between Fontaine and Ryan reached an impasse, Jack was forced to use a package material, a pistol, to board a plane with a package and hijack the plane and crash it near the lighthouse
 Instructions were sent so that he could return to Rapture and Fontaine uses it as a weapon
 chunki jaik rayaan kaa putr tha, isiliye vah mukt rup se rapchar ke krodmandal network kaa prayog kar sakaa, jise rayaan ke "genetic daayre" ke bheetar ke logon ke alaava anya sabhi ke liye pratibandhit kar diya gaya he
 Eventually, Ryan lets Jack be killed by wanting to die according to his own terms
 rayaan kii maut ke baad jaik ko is baat kaa ahsaas hota he ki use niyantrit karne ke liye atlas bhi us vishisht vaakyansh kaa prayog karata rahaa he, lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki hoti he
 Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, who pretends to have died to avoid being stalked by Ryan and to take control of the city, leaving Jack in the grace of reactive security systems
 gives
 dow tennenbom or unki little sisters nikaas system se bachakar nikalne main jaik kii sahaayta karti hai, jahaan vah girakar behosh ho jaataa he
 By the time Jack becomes conscious, Dr
 Tenenbom has already neutralized some of her customized reactions and helps her break the rest, one of which would have eventually stopped her heartbeat
 jab fontan ke saamne yah spasht ho jaataa he ki vah jaik par apana niyantran khota ja rahaa he, to fontan is vicitra tathy kaa ullekh karata he ki tennenbom ek agni-kand peedit ke rup main dwitiya vishwa-yuddh or rapchar kii ladaai donon se batch gai he or chaalaaki bharaa sanket detaa he ki uskaa swayan kaa apana ek agenda he
 With the help of Little Sisters, Jack succeeds in defeating Fontaine
 darkinar kar diye jane par fontan swayan ke sharir main adam kii ek bahut badi maatra kaa injection laga letaa he or ek amanviya daanav ban jaataa he
 Jack battles with Fontaine and eventually prevails, allowing the Little Sisters to subdue Fontaine to take Adam from his body, leading to his death
 khilaadi dwaara little sisters ke saath kiye gayi vyavhaar ke aadhaar par khel ke teen ant sambhav hai, jinamein se teenon hi dow tennenbom dwaara bataaye gayi hai
 If a player has not murdered a sister or killed only one sister, at the end there are five Little Sisters returning to the surface with Jack, who lives his entire life under his care, including His college education includes completing, marrying and producing children; It ends with a heart touching tune and we see Jack lying on the death bed surrounded by five adult Little Sisters
 yadi khilaadi ne sabhi yaa lagbhag sabhi little sisters kii kataai kii ho, to fontan ko haraane ke baad jaik unki ore mudata he or yah maanate hue khel samaapt ho jaataa he ki usne un sabhi ko markar unka sara adam le liya he
 Tenenbom explains what has happened and condemns Jack in a tone full of anger and humiliation
 baad main duusare ant main, parmaanu misile le ja rahi jorge washington shrenee kii ek pandubbi vimaan ke malbe ke paas pahunchati he or achaanak use krodmandalon dwaara gher liya jaataa he, jisamen splisar savaar hai
 These splicers kill all the people in the submarine and take control of it
 yadi khilaadi ne ek se adhik little sisters kii hatya kii he, lekin vah pichley ant par nahin pahunchaa he, to drishyaatmak rup se ant duusare ant ke samaan hota he, haalanki pichhali baar ke krodhpurna swar ke bajaay is baar tennenbom kaa swar dukh bharaa hota he or unke sanvaadon me thodaa antar bhi he
 Originally, Bioshock's screenplay was very different from the script of its released version: its main character was a "cynical diprogrammer" - to save a person from a cult and to lead that person to a normal life psychologically and psychologically
 a person obsessed with adjusting - was
 udhaaharan ke liye, ken lewine is baat kaa ek udhaaharan dete hai ki ek sanakee deprogrammer kya karata he" " aise log hai, jinhone ek samalangik sambandh main rah chuki apni beti ko deprogram karne ke liye logon kii sevaayen leen hai
 They kidnap him and reprogram him and in reality it was a puzzler and you were the character
 is kahani kaa swaroop adhik rajnatik rahaa hota, jisamen ek saansad dwaara paatr kii sevaayen leen jaatin
 bioshock par kiye ja rahe vikaas kii 2004 main aadhikarik rup se ghoshnaa kiye jane tak, isaki katha or prishthbhumi main bahut adhik badlaav ho gaya tha
 Now the game is played in an abandoned underground experiment of World War II, which has recently been taken out of the ground by twenty-first century scientists
 prayogshaala ke bheetar chal rahe genetic anusandhanon ne swayan ko jeevon kii teen "jatiyon", jinka ullekh "chaalakahin vayuyanon", "sainikon" or "parabhakshiyon" ke rup main kiya gaya he, ke aas-paas kendrit ek paristhitik-tantra main nirmit kar liya he
 This would eventually form the basis for "little Sisters", "big Daddy" and "splicer" appearing in the "artificial Ecology" dynamic game
 haalanki, is kahani kaa gemple khel ke release kiye gayi sanskaran ke samaan tha, lekin isaki katha main parivartan hue, jo ki lewine ke anusaar khel ke dizine ko pehle rakhane ke khel ke tatkaaleen-ataarkik nirdeshak siddhant ke saath susangat the
 Levine also mentioned that "it was never my intention to make two ends for the game
 ek tarah se yah vichaar bahut baad main aayaa or yah kuch aisa tha, jiskaa nivedan khaadya-shrinkhalaa main mujhase upar sthit kisi vyakti ne kiya tha
 In an interview to a question asked by gaming website IGN about the game's narrative and background, Levine said, "I have an unusable degree of free-art, so i put the content of Anne Rand and George Orwell and the twentieth i read all kinds of idealistic and wretched writing of the century, which i really found interesting
 " lewine ne "stem cell anusandhan or sambandhit naitik muddon main" apni ruchi kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 In terms of artistic influence, Levine mentions the books Nineteen eighty-four and Logans Run, which represent societies that "have some really interesting ideas, distorted by the fact that We are people " According to the developers, Bioshock is a spiritual follow-up to the system shock games and was produced by former developers of the same series
 lewine kaa daawa he ki jab unhone system shock 2 kaa nirmaan kiya tha, usee samay se unki team usee tarah kaa ek anya khel banane ke bare main vichaar karti rahi thi
 In his description of a video first screened at E3 2006, Levine has pointed out several similarities between these games
 inamen anek tulana-yogya gemple tatv hai: bioshock main "eve hypos" dwaara diye jane vaale plasmid vahi kaary karte hai, jo system shock 2 main "piesai hypos" dwaara di jane vaali "syonic kshamtaaon" dwaara kiya jaataa he; donon hi khelon main khilaadi ko suraksha camaron, mashin gan burjon kaa muqabla karnaa padataa he or uske paas unamem send lagane kii kshamta hoti he; yuddh-saamagree ke sangrakshan kaa ullekh "gemple kii ek mukhya visheshta" ke rup main kiya gaya he; or katha sunaati hui audio tepe ricarding usee bhoomika kii purti karti he, jo system shock khelon main i-mail abhilekhon dwaara nibhaai gai thi
 Modifiable weapons with multiple weapon types and similar to finding an enemy to inflict more damage are also present in the "ghost" bioshock used in System Shock 2
 iske atirikt, atlas radio ke dwaara lagbhag usee tarah khilaadi kaa maargdarshan karata he, jis prakaar system shock 2 main jenis polito dwaara kiya jaataa he or inamen se prayek paatr kaa khel ke bich ise ek samaan mode detaa he
 Both games offer the player more than one method of accomplishing tasks, allowing for the chance of casual gameplay

5 praudyogiki, jiskaa prayog swat 4 or swat 4: da skalecove syndicate sahit irrational games ke pichley sheershakon main kiya gaya tha, ke atyadhik sanshodhit sanskaran kaa prayog karata he
 During an interview at E3 in May 2006, Levaine announced that the features of the Unreal Engine 3
0 would also be integrated and emphasized the advanced effects of water: "for this game only, we hired the services of a water programmer and water artist And they are very powerful and you have never seen this kind of water before
 ” aalochakon ne is chitratmak sudhaar kii prashansa kii he or gemespot ne kaha he, “chaahe yah farsh par sthir jal ho yaa kisi visphot ke baad ufanta hua samudri jal, har baar jab aap ise dekhenge, to yah aapako baha le jayega
 "if the system meets the hardware and software requirements of Direct310, the Windows version of bioshock can use its features and content, but it will also run on directx 9 without additional impact
 in do epiai ke bich chitra kii gunvattta main kuch antar hai, jaise atirikt jal pratibimb or sookshm-kan prabhaav, haalanki, khilaadi ke drushtikon se ye antar bahut sookshm hai

 Some reviewers have also found that there is a lack of diversity in the immune behavior of splicers, and that moral selection is so "black and white" that it does not really look interesting
 kuch samikshakon or nibandhkaron, jaise jonathan blo, ne yah bhi paaya he ki is khel ne khilaadi ke liye jo “naitik chayan” prastaavit kiya he, vah iskaa dosha hi he kyonki vastav main khel par isse koi prabhaav nahin padataa, jisase khilaadi ko mahasoos hota he ki sisters keval maikenic thim, jinka koi vaastavik mahatv nahin tha

 The retail version of bioshock for Windows uses Securom copy protection software and requires Internet activation to complete its installation
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki isi vajah se 23 agast 2007 ko australia main is khel kii madhyaraatri release ko nirast karnaa padaa tha kyonki 2ke games ke sarwar uplabdh nahin the or jab tak ve punah online na aa gaye hote, tab tak khel ko khelaa janaa sambhav nahin tha
 Through Securome, users were originally limited to only two activations of the game
 prayoktaaon ne paaya ki bhale hi ve khel ko punah install karne se purv ise hataa den, tab bhi unhen khel ko punahsakriy karne ke liye securom se sampark karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 The issue was further aggravated by the fact that the printed directory contained an incorrect telephone as well as consumers living outside the USA were forced to make an international call to the USA
 isaki pratikriya main 2ke games or securom ne punah kol karne kii aavashyaktaa se purv uplabdh activeshnon kii sankhya badhaakar paanch kar di

 2ke games ne is baat se inkaar kiya he ki is seemaa kaa uddeshy yah tha
 Two months after the initial release, 2K developed a special pre-installation utility, attempting to address consumer complaints, to return activation slots to the user
 However this tool does not consider situations in which the game is installed on a PC that has more than one user account because it only works once on a PC, nor does it become unusable for an installation
 , For example due to hard-disk failure, is able to recover an activation, causing such activation to be lost forever Es
 2ke games ne vishisht rup se inamen se prayek mudde kaa ullekh pratiprapti upkaran ke effecue main kiya he, or kaha he ki jab tak aisi sthitiyon ke liye software samaadhaan nahin dhund liye jate, tab tak ve paanch activeshnon kii seemaa ke baad atirikt activeshan ke nivednon kaa nipataara sthiti-dar-sthiti aadhaar par karenge
 According to information received as of 19 June 2008, 2K Games has removed the activation limit, allowing users to install the game countless times
 haalanki, online activeshan anivaary bana hua he
 In August 2007, Ken Levine promised deactivation of the system when retailing of the PC version of the game was no longer an issue

 Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 a conscript triplet is a six-digit, three-byte plot number, used in HTML to display colors
 teenon bite darshaati hai kisi ek rang ke laal, haraa, nila ghatak
 a byte is from 00 to FF, or 0 to 255
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows : These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in the 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F, BC, 8B
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 Template: Color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
 The lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities are 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%
 are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: 2902 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of 2902 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 The use of the Devanagari issue on Hindi Wikipedia has been a disputed decision, which has been decided several times by voting
 With a stroke of luck, i have found the system files for the Hindi Wikipedia interface
 i have been luck enough to change the template namespace to saanchaa, and now it is the time to choose whether to user Hindu numbers or Devanagari numbers in all automated dates and years etcetera
 i have set up a poll

-- Wolfavart 15:14, 12 April 2007 As dadhikeshaji said, please explain why
 i have explained why i believe we should use roman 
 shukriya, or vikipedia par aapkaa swaagat he!--woolfavaarta 07:47, 14 april 2007 Hindi is not just language of India it is also used in many other countries hence if Indian gov does not use dev numerals then it does not mean that we all also stop using dev numerals
 the place from where i am is lko in UP here i see many ppl using dev numerals even UP education board uses dev numerals
 my mean is tht we must use Hindi as the way it is not by modifying iti would again say that the essence of hindi are related to hindi numerals - sumit sinhavarta Maquahuitl 10:19, 23 april 2007 But i don't think that is the point, what other Wikipedias use
 i think what is most important is what the majority of Hindi writers use 
-- Wolfavart 14:17, 23 April 2007 Thanks manish vashishtha - 24 april yaa 24 april Use of Devanagari or Roman numerals !! i also came wearing this question
 tarikho ke lekh banaate samay shaayad
 Then took the opinion of some people and chose Roman over Devanagari
 adhiktar jagah roman anko kaa prayog hota he, is tark par
 And since then i have been using Roman numerals on articles, especially where dates are used
 yah mere liye thoda asuvidhajanak sabit hua he
 Whenever you have to use marks, you have to switch between writing English and Hindi
 ab agar ham devanagari anko ko maanak banaate he to jahaan-jahaan roman anko kaa prayog hua he, use badalanaa hoga
 Both are difficult
 roman anko kaa prayog jari rakhana kam mushkil lagata he
 So, my opinion is in keeping the Roman numbers standard
 Devnagari numerals or Roman!! seemed an old question to me
 Probably, when i had to create date articles
 Consulted few people and choose roman over devnagari, because it was more widely used
 Since then i have been using roman numerals, specially for dates
 It has been little inconvenient for me
 Whenever i have to use numerals, i have to switch between hindi-english typing
 Now, if we favor devnagari over roman, we had to change wherever we used roman
 Both are difficult
 It seems to be less difficult to carry on using roman numerals
 So, i think we should keep using roman numerals
--mitul 21:31, 27 april 2007 i think Devanagari numbers should be used
 jaise ki yaan kahata he angrezi sankhyaayein sirf aaj kaa shauq he or jo likh chukaa he vah ham bahut aasaani se badal sakate hai
 And it is also difficult to switch between Hindi and English keyboard while writing
 bairnar 13:43, 30 april 2007 And why do we always judge popularity by the big cities
 In small cities / towns and villages, the literate people still use Devanagari numerals
maquahuitl 21:02, 3 May 2007 Finally, i have found an "official" article about this: http: / / rajbhasha
nic

htm in Hindi or http: / / rajbhasha

htm in English
 Here is the extract in English: The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devnagari script
 The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals
 Notwithstanding anything in clause, for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorize the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devnagari form of numerals in addition to the internationl form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union
 Notwithstanding anything in this article, Parliament may be law provide for the use, after the said period of fifteen years, of- the English language, or the Devnagari form of numerals, for such purposes as may be specified in the law
 and in Hindi: anuchhed 343
 sangh kii rajbhasha-- The official language of the Union will be Hindi and the script Devanagari, the form of the numerals used for the official purposes of the Union will be the international form of the Indian numerals

 Please give your comments
--woolfavaarta 15:32, 8 may 2007 i have completely changed my mind now
 Dadhikeshji's idea is great, or, since i have been doing a bit of research in both books and on the Internet, i think the usage of Devanagari numerals is good
 Devanagari numerals are used in more formal and important content; and what is more formal and important than an encyclopedia? What is your opinion? - Wolfwort 16:30, 10 May 2007 sabhi mahanubhaavon ko namaskara, After the experience of the last three-four months, i completely agree with Rohit ji that the news that is being displayed on the homepage does not match the Hindi Wikipedia pace

 iske alaava duusari baat jo main deshon kii site ko apted karte samay shiddat ke saath mahasoos kar rahaa hum, vah he sankhyaon main hindi kaa prayog
 i think if we use English numbers on Hindi Wikipedia, then it will be very useful for those people who use these articles by copy-pasting them for research

 aaj jaha hindi apane astitv ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he, bharat ke sabhi rajya uskaa istemaal nahin karte, adhiktar dastavej english main hote he or internet kii to maatrabhasha english he hi, hamen kya hindi ke anko kaa prayog karnaa chahie? Some time ago, in an interview with a famous poet, i got his thoughts that Hindi which is not so popular is because of its difficult vocabulary and different marks of Hindi
 Take the example of the bank, on the slip depositing the money, the name of the signer is written, can it not write "name of the depositor"
 These are the words of Marra everyday and it is not necessary to have special knowledge of Hindi to understand them
 lagbhag har bhartiya ko jo kii hindi bhashi hai va jo kii hindi vikipedia kaa upyog karata hai use hindi padani aati hai, va voh hindi vikipedia computer par dekh rahaa he to use english kaa praarambhik gyaan to he hi
 hindi ke anko / nambaron ko har koi hindi bhashi nahin samaj saktaa, hamen skulon main hindi padaai jaati he or kisi bhi english medium skool main hindi ke ank nahin padaae jate
 In the end, i request that will it be right that we use English only with consensus

 are serving in Hindi
 As far as the matter of Microsoft Office is concerned, you must have been mistaken by me that this Microsoft's operating system does not work completely in Hindi

 It is all based on my own experience

 In the epigraph of the Chinese historian, the great historian, its author Seema Chien wrote that Han thought that over time the son of that princess would become king of the Shionganu kingdom and he would consider the Chinese emperor his maternal grandfather
 usne kaha ki 'bhala kabhi koi baccha apane naanaa par hamalaa karata he kya?' lekin aisa nahin hua or aise vivaahon ke baavjood hathapayee jari rahi jisamen kabhi haan chiniyon kaa palada baari hota tha or kabhi shiyongnu logon kaa

 In the context of Indian philosophy, direct is one of the three major evidences
 yah pramaan sabase shreshth mana jaataa he
 The literal meaning of 'direct' is that of the object in front of the eyes
 yahan 'aankh' se taatpary sabhi indriyon se he
 Direct means per + axis
 prati kaa arth 'saamne' or aksh kaa arth 'aankh', yani pratyaksh kaa arth 'aankh ke saamne' hota he
 Here, the meaning of the axis is not narrow, but the broad meaning in front of the five senses means that the knowledge that comes before the five senses is called direct knowledge
 yah gyaan prapti kaa saadhan he
 According to the philosophy of justice, the meaning of direct is the sense of sensuality
 pratyaksh gyaan kii utpatti kuch is prakaar hoti he
 Out of these, the coincidence form of soul, mind and senses which is the cause or proof of knowledge is the same
 vastu ke saath indriya-sanyog hone se jo uskaa gyaan hota he usee ko 'pratyaksh' kehete hai
 Gautama has said in the Nyasutra that the knowledge of any substance through the senses is evident
 jaise, yadi hamen saamne aage jalati hui dikhaai de athwa ham uske taap kaa anubhav karen to yah is baat kaa pratyaksh pramaan he ki 'aag jal rahi he'
 In this knowledge, there should be a direct relation between matter and sense
 yadi koi yah kahe ki 'vah kitaab puraani he' to yah pratyaksh pramaan nahin he; kyonki isamen jo gyaan hota he, vah keval shabdon ke dwaara hota he, padaarth ke dwaara nahin, isiliye yah shabdpraman ke antargat chalaa jaayga
 But if the same book comes in front of us and appears dirty or torn, then we must have a direct knowledge that 'this book is old'
 pratyaksh gyaan kisi ke kahe hue shabdon dwaara nahin hota, isi se use 'avyapadeshy' kehete hai
 The direct is said to be unfaithful because it has the same knowledge of what it is
 kuch naiyayik is gyaan ke karan ko hi pramaan maanate hai
 According to his opinion, 'direct evidence' is sense, knowledge generated from sense is 'direct knowledge'
 par avyapadeshy pad se sutarakaar kaa abhipraay spasht he ki vastu kaa jo nirviklpak gyaan he vahi pratyaksh pramaan he
 The new writers combine both the views and say that due to direct knowledge there are three
 pehali avasthaa main jab keval indriya hi karan ho to uskaa fal vah pratyaksh gyaan hoga jo kisi padaarth ke pehle pahal saamne aane se hota he
 Like, something appears in front of her
 is gyaan ko 'nirviklpak gyaan' kehete hai
 In the second stage, it seems that what is in front is a book
 yah 'saviklpak gyaan' hua
 The reason for this knowledge is the relation of sense
 jab indriya ke sambandh se utpann gyaan karan hota he, tab yah gyaan ki yah kitaab acchhee he athwa buree he, pratyaksh gyaan hua
 There are 6 types of direct knowledge - queensland, australia kaa ek rajya he
 Its capital is the city of Brisbane
 maanav yaa kisi anya jantu ke sharir kii us dasha ko pootibhawan yaa sajarmata kehete hai jisamen sharir apane hi utakon yaa angon ko nasht karne lagata he
 It is clear that this is a fatal situation

 James Webb Space Telescope) is a type of infrared space observatory
 yah habal antariksh doordarshee kaa vaigyanik uttaradhikari or aadhunik peedi kaa doordarshee he, jise june 2014 main arian 5 raaket se prakshepit kiya jayega
 Its main function is to observe distant bodies of the universe that are beyond the reach of observatories and Hubble telescopes on Earth
 JWST, nasa or united state spes agency kii ek pariyojna he jise european spes agency, kenadian spes agency or pandrah anya deshon kaa intaraashtriya sahyog praapt he
 Its original name was Next Generation Space Visionary), renamed in 2002 after nasa's second administrator James Edwin Webb
 james edwin web ne kennedy se lekar jonson prashasan kaal tak nasa kaa netritv kiya tha
 Under his supervision, NASA made several important launches, including all the Mercury launches under the Gemini program and the first manned Apollo flight
 JWST kii kaksha prithvi se pare pandrah lakh kilometre dur lagranj bindu L2 par hogi arthath prithvi kii sthiti hamensha surya or L2 bindu ke bich bani rahegi
 Since the objects in the L2 point always orbit the Sun under the cover of the Earth, the JWST would only need a radiation shield that would be positioned between the telescope and the Earth
 yah vikiran kavach surya se aane vaali garmi or prakaash se tathaa kuch maatra main prithvi se aane vaali avarakt vikiranon se doordarshee kii raksha karegi
 The radius of the orbit of JWST located around the L2 point is very high, due to which the shadow of any part of the earth will not fall on it
 surya kii apeksha prithvi se kaaphi kareeb hone ke baavjood JWST par koi grahan nahin lagegaa
 JWST is the main four components of the primary scientific mission
 pehla, big-baing ke pashchaat brahmand main bani sabase pehali akashganga or sabase pehle bane taare kii khoj karnaa
 Second, to study the formation and evolution of galaxies
 teesraa, taron kaa gathan or grahiy pranaliyon ko samajhnaa tathaa chauthaa, jivan kii utpatti or grahiy pranaliyon kaa adhyayan karnaa
 All of these functions can be analyzed more effectively in infrared light than in visible light
 yahi kaaran he ki JWST ke upkaran habal telescope kii tarah drishy yaa parabangnee upaay vaale nahin honge balki isamen badi maatra main avarakt prakaash ko ikattha karne kii kshamta hogi
 The current design of the JWST is designed so that it will easily detect wavelengths of expansion ranging from 0
6 to 28 micrometers deep)
 kisi vajah se is vedhashala ko june 2014 se pehle prakshepit nahin kiya ja sakegaa tathaa vartmaan kaarykram ke anusaar lagbhag 6
2 ton dravyaman vaale is telescope ko ' guyana antariksh centre' koru, french guyana se prakshepan vaahan ' arian 5 ' ki madad se kaksha main sthapit kiya jayega |sthapit hone ke lagbhag 6 maheene baad yah vedhashala kam se kam agle paanch varshon ke liye vaigyanik mishan ke liye saunp di jaaegi |is vedhashala ko is prakaar taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he ki vaigyanik mishan kii vistaar kii sambhaawanaaon ke hisaab se isaki maujuuda kshamtaaon ko badhaakar isaki nirdhaarit kaarykaal avadhi badhai ja sakegi
 The orbit of JWST will be elliptical and its radius will be eight million kilometers around the semi-permanent second lagrange point L2
 prithvi -surya L2 bindu kii prithvi se duuri pandrah lakh kilometre he
 This distance is four times more than the distance between the Earth and the Moon
 itani lambi duuri par sthit hone ke kaaran prakshepan ke pashchaat web telescope kii seva lenaa habal telescope kii apeksha bahut kathinaayee bharaa kaary hoga
 There is currently no plan to think about it
 wein vastuen jo prithvi kii kaksha se baahar sthit hoti he saadharantaya surya kaa ek chakkar lagane main ek varsh se zyada samay leti he
 However the gravitational stretch at the L2 point is balanced
 iskaa arth yah he ki JWST or prithvi, surya ki parikrama saath-saath karenge
 The combined gravitational force of the Sun and Earth will hold the spacecraft at this point
 saidhantik rup se antariksh yaan ko L2 se hokar guzarane vaali kaksha main parikrama karne ke liye kisi atirikt dhakke ki zarurat nahin hogi, yah swatah hi prithvi ke saath-saath surya kii parikrama karata rahegaa
 The true successor of the JWST Hubble Space telescope is that it is able to see more and more stars than expected
 tulana karne ke liye habal antariksh doordarshee se lee gai kerina niharika kii do chhaviyon ko lete hai 
 Both are images of the same celestial body
 upari chitra drishy prakaash main liya gaya he jabaki nichalaa chitra avarakt prakaash main liya gaya he
 Carefully looking at both images, it is clear that more stars can be seen in an image taken in infrared light, while relatively less stars are seen in an image taken in visible light from the same location
 drishy varnakram kii nazren gas or dhul ke paar thik se nahin dekh sakati, jisase chhaviyaan dhundhlee milti he jabaki avarakt varnakram main aasaani se paar dekha ja saktaa he
 Almost all types of gases and dust make the scene completely disappear by blurring images taken in visible light
 iske vipareet avarakt prakaash main gas or dhul ke peeche sthit taron kii spasht chhavi milti he
 Infrared astronomy can penetrate the gray areas of space, detect planets, and even see the high red-deviation objects of the early days of the universe
 hamaare najadik sthit taron kii apeksha dur sthit adhiktar taare naveekrut yaa jawan he tathaa unka janm samay kaal main bigbeng ke kaaphi kareeb hua he
 Since the universe is spreading, the light reaching us through these renewed stars exhibits red-deviations in the spectrum and that is why they can be easily seen in infrared light
 avarakt prakaash kaa upyog sakriy akashgangaon ke kor kaa avlokan karne ki liye bhi hota he jo ki praayah gas or dhul se aachhadit hota he
 The Near Infrared Spectrograph is one of the four instruments of the web telescope
 yah ek bahu-vastu spectrograph he jo ek saath 100 se adhik khagoleey vastuon kaa avlokan karne main sakasham he
 This will provide the basis for the four main science objectives of the web telescope by low, medium and high-resolution spectroscopic observation
 niyar infrared spectrograph europea udyog dwaara iese ke vinirdeshon ke liye nirmit hua he tathaa iesteisi, netherland main iese jedblusty pariyojna dwaara prabandhit he
 The mid infrared instrument is one of the four instruments of the web telescope
 yah upkaran madhyam or nimna-rejolusan spectroscopy kii sidhi tasviren tathaa coronagraphic tasviren uplabdh karaayega
 It is expected to contribute significantly to all primary science objectives of web telescope

 The main mirror of the web telescope is made of gold coating on beryllium metal
 yah ek centre ke chaaron ore do valyon main vyavasthit shatkon aakaar ke 18 khando se milakar bana ek darpan he
 Each section has a diameter of 1
3 meters and a weight of about 20 kg

 The web will do this work by inspecting distant galaxies that are 13 billion light years away from us
 sudur sthit aisi bejaan vastuon ko dekhne ke liye web ko ek bade darpan kii zarurat padegi
 The greater the area of the mirror, the more light it can gather and the more closely the object can be seen
 yadi habal telescope ke 2

 Beryllium is able to keep its shape stable even under different temperatures
 saath hi yah vidyut or taap kaa acha suchalak he or isame chumbakeey gun bhi nahin paaya jaataa he
 Placing such a large mirror inside the launch vehicle is also a problem in itself
 itnaa bada darpan yaan main samaa nahin saktaa or prakaashiki iske aakaar ko chota karne kii ijaajat nahin detaa | is samasya ke hal ke liye web dal ne darpan ko aise kai khandon main banane kaa nirnay liya jise sametakar aakaar itnaa chota kiya ja sake kii yah yaan main aasaani se samaa jaae | web doordarshee ko uski kaksha main sthapit karne ke baad darpan ko khol diya jayega jisase yah apana purv aakaar praapt kar legaa
