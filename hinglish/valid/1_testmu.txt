 According to the Bible, Mary's mother Mary was a resident of the village of Nazareth in Galilee province
 unki sagaai daaud ke rajwanshi yusuf naamak badhai se hui thi
 Even before marriage, she became pregnant with divine influence while being a virgin
 ishwar kii ore se sanket paakar yusuf ne unhen patniswaroop grahan kiya
 Thus, the people were not aware of the supernatural origin of Jesus
 vivaah sampann hone ke baad yusuf galilia chhodkar yahudiya praant ke bethalehem naamak nagari main jaakar rahane lage, vahaan isa kaa janm hua
 Joseph fled to Egypt to save the infant from the tyranny of King Herod

 Jesus learned Joseph's profession and continued to work as a carpenter until he was about 30 years old
 bible main unke 13 se 29 varshon ke bich kaa koi zikr nahin miltaa
 At the age of 30, he took a dip in water from John
 dubkee ke baad isa par pavitra aatma aayaa
 After 40 days of fasting, Jesus started teaching people
 tees saal kii umr main isa ne israel kii janata ko yahudee dharm kaa ek nayaa rup prachaarit karnaa shuru kar diya
 At that time, those below thirty years old were not given to read scripture in the hall and to teach
 unhone kaha ki ishwar saakshaat premrup he or us vaqt ke varttman yahudee dharm kii pashubali or karmkand nahin chahta
 Judaism is not the beloved race of God, God loves all countries
 insaan ko krodh main badla nahin lenaa chahie or kshamaa karnaa siikhnaa chahie
 He clearly stated that he is the son of God, he is the Christ and the way to heaven and salvation
 yahudee dharm main qayamat ke din kaa koi khaas zikr yaa mahatva nahin tha, par isa ne qayamat ke din par khaas jor diya - kyonki usee vaqt swarg yaa nark insaani aatma ko milegaa
 Jesus also performed many miracles
 yahudiyon ke kattarpanthi rabbiyon ne isa kaa baari virodh kiya
 He did not find anything special in Jesus like the Messiah
 unhen apane karmkandon se prem tha
 It was a huge sin for him to call himself the son of God
 isaliye unhone us vaqt ke roman governor pilaatus ko isaki shikaayat kar di
 The Romans always feared the Jewish Revolution
 isaliye kattarpanthiyon ko prasann karne ke liye pilaatus ne isa ko cross par maut kii dardanaak sazaa sunai
 According to the Bible, Roman soldiers killed Jesus with a whip
 unhen shahi kapade pahanaae, unke sar par kaanton kaa taj sajaayaa or unpar thuka or aise unhen tauheen main "yahudiyon kaa badshaah" banaaya
 Having carried his own cross on the back, the Romans took him to Galgata, where he was to be hanged on the cross
 galgata pahunchane par, unhen madiraa or pitt kaa mishran pesh kiya gaya tha
 In that era, this mixture was given to reduce the extreme pain of capital punishment

 According to the Bible, Jesus was hung on a cross between two thieves
 isaayiyon kaa maananaa he ki cross par marate samay isa messiah ne sabhi insaanon ke paap swayan par le liye the or isliye jo bhi isa main vishwaas karegaa, use hi swarg milegaa
 Three days after his death, Jesus resurrected and went to heaven 40 days later
 isa ke 12 shishyon ne unke naye dharm ko sabhi jagah failaayaa
 This religion was called Christianity
 herodes raja ke dinon main jab yahudiya ke baitalaham main yishu kaa janm hua, to dekho, purv se kai jyotishi jerushlem main aakar poochne lage
 Where is the king of the Jews who is born? Because we have seen his star in the past and have come to bow down to him
 yah sunakar herodes raja or uske saath sara jerushlem ghabara gaya
 And he gathered all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them, where should Christ be born? They said to him, in Bethlehem, Judea; Because that's how it is written by the prophet
 ki he baitalaham, jo yahuda ke desh main he, tu kisi reeti se yahuda ke adhikariyon main sab se chota nahin; kyonki tujh main se ek adhipati nikalegaa, jo meri praja israel kii rakhwali karegaa
 Then Herod secretly called the astrologers and asked them, at what time did the star appear
 or us ne yah kahkar unhen baitalaham bheja, ki jaakar us balak ke vishay main thik thik maaloom karo or jab vah mil jaae to mujhe samachar do taaki main bhi aakar us ko pranaam karun
 Hearing the king, they went away and, look, the star which they had seen in the past, went ahead of them and reached the place where the child was
 They were very happy to see that star
 or us ghar main pahunchakar us balak ko us kii mata mariyam ke saath dekha or munh ke bal girakar use pranaam kiya; or apana apana yaila kholkar use sona or lohban or gandharas kii bhent chadhaai
 And having received a warning in his dream that he should not go back to Herod, he went to his country by another route
 After they left, see, a messenger of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Get up; Take the child and his mother and flee to the land of Egypt; And stay there until i tell you; Because Herod is looking for this child to have him killed
 vah raat hi ko uthakar balak or us kii mata ko lekar misr ko chal diya
 And remained there until Herod died; Because that word that the Lord had said through the prophet that i had called my son from Egypt to be fulfilled
 jab herodes ne yah dekha, ki jyotishiyon ne mere saath thattha kiya he, tab vah krodh se bhar gaya; or logon ko bhejkar jyotishiyon se thik thik puche hue samay ke anusaar baitalaham or uske aas paas ke sab ladakon ko jo do varsh ke, vaa us se chote the, marava daalaa
 Then the word that was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, that a shrill sound was heard in Ramah, weeping and great lamentation, Rachel wept for her children and did not want to be calm, because they are not
 Look after Herod's death, the angel of the Lord said to Joseph in Egypt in a dream
 ki uth, balak or us kii mata ko lekar israel ke desh main chalaa ja; kyonking jo balak ke praan lenaa chaahate the, ve mar gaye
 He got up and took the boy and his mother along and came to the land of Israel
 parantu yah sunakar ki arikhalouse apane pita herodes kii jagah yahudiya par rajya kar rahaa he, vahaan jane se daraa; or swapn main chituni paakar galeel desh main chalaa gaya
 And settled in the city of Nazareth; So that the word that was said by the prophets would be called Nazarene
 or balak badhata or balwant hota or buddhi se paripurna hota gaya; or parameshwar kaa anugrah us par tha
 His parents traveled to Jerusalem every year at the Passover
 jab vah baarah varsh kaa hua, to ve parv kii reeti ke anusaar jerushlem ko gaye
 And when they completed those days and returned, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem; And this was not known by his parents
 ve yah samajhakar, ki vah or yatriyon ke saath hoga, ek din kaa padaav nikal gaye: or use apane kutumbiyon or jaan-pahachaanon main dhundhane lage
 But when they were not found, they returned again to Jerusalem in search of seekers
 or teen din ke baad unhone use mandir main upadeshkon ke bich main baithe, un kii sunate or un se prashn karte hue paaya
 And all those who were listening to him were amazed at his understanding and answers
 tab ve use dekhakar chakit hue or us kii mata ne us se kaha; he putr, tu ne ham se kyon aisa vyavhaar kiya? dekh, tera pita or main kudhate hue tuje dhundhate the
 he told them; Why did you find me Didn't you know that i must be in my father's house? But what he said to them, they did not understand
 tab vah un ke saath gaya or nasarat main aayaa or un ke vash main rahaa; or us kii mata ne ye sab baaten apane man main rakhin
 or yishu buddhi or deal-doll main or parameshwar or manushyon ke anugrah main badhata gaya
 In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a virgin in the city of Nazareth in Galilee
 jis kii mangani yusuf naam daaud ke gharaane ke ek purush se hui thi: us kunvaari kaa naam mariyam tha
 And the angel came to him and said, Glory and joy be yours, God is with you, the Lord is with you
 vah us vachan se bahut ghabara gai or sochane lagi, ki yah kis prakaar kaa abhivadan he? swargadoot ne us se kaha, he mariyam; bhaybheet na ho, kyonki parameshwar kaa anugrah tujh par hua he
 And see, you will be pregnant and you will have a son; You name him Jesus
 vah mahaan hoga; or parampradhan kaa putr kehalaayegaa; or prabhu parameshwar uske pita daaud kaa singhaasana us ko degaa
 And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; And his kingdom will not end
 mariyam ne swargadoot se kaha, yah kyonkar hoga? main to purush ko jaanati hi nahin
 The angel answered him; That the Holy Spirit will descend upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, so the Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God
 yishu ne or bhi bahut chinh chelon ke samhane dikhaae, jo is pustak main likhe nahin gaye
 But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and believe that you may have life in his name
 
 This was a very good man with a hand on his head and he was blessed by Jesus who performed countless miracles in his life that were impossible for anyone else on earth
 islam bible main isa messiah ko ek aadarneey nabi mana jaataa he, jo ishwar ne israeliyon ko unke sandesh failaane ko bheja tha

 And repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name in all nations from Jerusalem

 And, behold, my father has promised me, i will take him down on you and stay in this city until you are empowered by heaven
 Then he took them out to Bethany and raised his hands and blessed them

 From the earliest times of the movement, when his focus was on the development of the national language and lingua franca, the importance of local customs and traditions, the movements that would again map Europe and lead the self-determination of nationality; Nationality, its role, expression and meaning became the major carriers of Romanticism

 In the Natyasastra, Bharata Muni, while explaining Rasa, has said - arthath vibhaav, anubhav, vyabhichaari bhav ke sanyog se ras kii nishpatti hoti he
 It is said in the well-known literature mirror that when the permanent sense of the heart attains a combination of affect, feeling and communicable feeling, it disappears in the form of rasa
 reetikaal ke pramukh kavi dev ne ras kii paribhaasha in shabdon main kii he : Thus there are four parts of rasa - Permanent feeling, Vibhava, Anubhav and communicative feeling
 bhav kaa arth he:-hona In the conscience of the heart, the psyche which is always present in the form of lust or sanskar and which no opponent or antagonist can suppress, is called permanent emotion
 ye maanav man main beej rup main, chirkaal tak achanchal hokar nivas karte hai
 These represent the sacrament or spirit
 ye sabhi manushyon main usee prakaar chhipe rahete hai jaise mitti main gandh avichhinn rup main samaai rahati he
 They are so capable that they merge with other emotions
 inaki sankhya 11 he - rati, haas, shok, utsaah, krodh, bhay, jugupsa, vismay, nirved, vatsaltaur ishwar vishyak prem
 Vibhava means reason
 ye sthaayee bhaavon kaa vibhaavan / udbodhan karte hai, unhen aswaad yogya banaate hai
 These are considered fundamental in the origin of juice
 vibhaav ke do bhed hai: The main emotion or object due to which the emotion originates is called poetic reception
 alamban ke antargat aate hai vishay or aashray
 The character towards which a character's feelings are awakened is the subject
 sahitya shaastra main is vishay ko alamban vibhaav athwa 'alamban' kehete hai
 The character in which the emotions are awakened is called the shelter
 sthaayee bhav ko jaagrath rakhane main sahaayak kaaran uddipan vibhaav kehalaate hai
 As an example, the enemy standing standing in front of the zeal of Veer Ras is enthusiasm
 shatru ke saath sena, yuddh ke baaje or shatru kii darpoktiyaan, garjana-tarjana, shastr sanchaalan aadi uddipan vibhaav hai
 There are two types of stimulus effects: arthath alamban kii uktiyaan or cheshthaayen That is, objects related to the environment
 prakritik drishyon kii gananaa bhi inhen ke anrtgat hoti hai
 The gestures of shelter that illuminate or convey permanent expressions like Rati, Haas, Mourning etc
 are called Anubhav
 ye cheshtaaen bhav-jagriti ke uparaant aashray main utpann hoti hai isliye inhen anubhav kehete hai, arthath jo bhaavon kaa anugaman kare vah anubhav kehalaata he
 Anubhav has two distinctions - the intended and the unwilling
 alamban evam uddipan ke madhyam se apane-apane kaarnon dwaara utpann, bhaavon ko baahar prakashit karne vaali saamaanya lok main jo kaary cheshtaaen hoti hai, ve hi kavy naatak aadi main nibaddh anubhav kehalaati hai
 For example, filling the sighs by the Viraha-distraught hero, watching with tears, sweat, thrill, affection in the spirit of union, handling of arms when awakened, harsh speech, red eyes, etc
 will be called Anubhav
 saadhaaran anubhav : arthath ke chaar bhed hai

 Optional 3
 Dietary 4
 Satvik
 aashray kii sharir sambandhi cheshtaaen angik yaa kayik anubhav he
 Earthly deflection, sarcasm etc
 are the rhetorical rhetorical experiences when the Rati Bhava is awake
 aropit yaa kritrim vesh-rachana aharya anubhav he
 But, in the wake of permanent feeling, natural, unnatural, ayatnaj, angvikar are called satvik experiences
 iske liye aashray ko koi bahya cheshtaa nahin kerani padati
 Hence they are called Ayatnaj
 ye swat: pradurbhoot hote hai or inhen roka nahin ja saktaa
 Satvik Anubhav: meaning there are eight distinctions - pillar, Sveda, thrill, Swarbhang, Vepathu, Vaivarnya, Tear and Pralaya
 jo bhav keval thodi der ke liye sthaayee bhav ko pusht karne ke nimitt sahaayak rup main aate hai or turant lupt ho jate hai, ve sanchari bhav hai
 The word sanchari means, to walk together, that is, to be transitive, communicable emotions are transmitted with a permanent emotion, they are capable enough that they can move in harmony with each permanent emotion
 isliye inhen vyabhichaari bhav bhi kaha jaataa he
 The number of communicable or adulterous expressions is considered 33 - Nirveda, guilt, doubt, Asuya, item, labor, laziness, lowliness, anxiety, fascination, memory, dhriti, vriada, chatliya, joy, impulse, inertia, pride, grief, sadness , Sleep, aphasma, dream, prabodh, amarsha, avhitha, raging, mati, disease, hysteria, death, tragedy and disarray
 bharatmuni ne kavy ke aavashyak tatv ke rup main ras kii pratishtha karte hue shringaar, hasya, raudra, karun, vir, adbhut, bibhats tathaa bhayanak naam se uske aath bhedon kaa spasht ullekh kiya he tathaa katipay panktiyon ke aadhaar par vidwaanon kii kalpana he ki unhone shant naamak nawein ras ko bhi sweekruti di he
 Navaras is the noun of these nine juices
 vibhavanubhav-sancharibhav ke sanyog se in rason kii nishpatti hoti he
 The permanence of each juice is different
 usee kii vibhavadi sanyog se paripurna honevaali nirvighn-pratiti-grahya avasthaa ras kehalaati he
 Sringar's permanent rite, humor humor, raudra's anger, Karun's grief, heroic excitement, wonder of wonder, jugupsa of fear, fear of terrible and permanent sham of calm or nirvade
 bharat ne aath rason ke devtaa kramash: vishnu, pramath, rudra, yamraj, indra, brahma, mahakaal tathaa kaldev ko mana he
 Narayana, the god of quiet juice, and his character Kundetu are said to be
 pratham aath rason ke kramash: shyaam, sit, rakt, kapot, gaur, pit, nil tathaa krishna varna maane gaye hai
 Bharata has considered the origin of humor, compassion, wonderful and terrible rasa in the first eight rasas, considering Shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatsa as the principal
 shringaar kii anukriti se hasya, raudra tathaa vir karm ke parinamswaroop karun tathaa adbhut evam vibhats darshan se bhayanak utpann hota he
 Anukriti means Abhinavagupta's words, so the feel of any juice can be productive of humor
 vikrut veshalankaradi bhi hasyotpadak hote hai
 The work of Rādra is destruction, hence the doer of Karun and the performer of heroic work are often seen doing unpardonable actions, so it seems natural to originate from him
 isi prakaar bibhatsadarshan se bhayanak kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 Smashanadi's philosophy alone is frightening
 tathaapi yah utpatti siddhant atyantik nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki parapaksh kaa raudra yaa vir ras swapaksh ke liye bhayanak kii sristi bhi kar saktaa he or bibhatsadarshan se shant kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 The origin of Karun is also possible from Raudra, terrible, Shringar, wonderful and heroic and terrible
 vastut: bharat kaa abhimath spasht nahin he
 After him, Dhananjaya considered the four stages of the mind as growth, expansion, disturbance and deflection, adornment and humor as growth, heroic and wonderful as expansion, disturbing and terrible as distraction and raudra and Karun related to deflection
 kintu jo vidvan keval druti, vistaar tathaa vikaas naamak teen hi avasthaaen maanate hai unka is vargeekaran se samaadhaan na hoga
 Similarly, if we consider the fluid state of the mind in Shringar, its expansion in humor and the wonderful, its brilliance in Veer and Raudra, and its hesitation in the horrors and the terrible, then even Bharata's order is not right
 ek sthiti ke saath duusari sthiti kii upasthiti bhi asambhav nahin he
 Deepti and Karun have both druti and hesitation with detail in the wonderful and heroic
 phir bhi bharatkrut sambandh sthaapan se itnaa sanket avashya miltaa he ki kathith rason main paraspar upakaarkarta vidyaman he or ve ek duusare ke mitra tathaa sahachaari hai
 Like friendship, the opposition of these juices has also been imagined according to the situation
 kis rasvishesh ke saath kin anya rason kaa turant varnan aswaad main baadhak hoga, yah virombhavna isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 Of Shringar from Karun, Bibhatsa, Raudra, Veer and Bhavya; Horrible and compassionate to comic; Karun with humor and adornment; Of humor, adornment and terrible of raudra; Shringar, Veer, Raudra, of humor and the terrible of calm; From the terrifying and serene to the heroic; Veer, adornment, raudra, humor and gruesome calm are considered opposites
 yah virodh aashray aikya, alamban aikya athwa nairantary ke kaaran upasthit hota he
 There is a possibility of this opposition in the management poetry itself
 muktak main prasang kii chand ke saath hi samaapti ho jane se iskaa bhay nahin rahata he
 The writer should avoid the presence of anti-rasam from the presence of the antagonistic juices and the alarms separately or by presenting the friendly juice of the two between the two opposing rasas or by presenting the amaranth of angras rather than the principal rasa
 
 ras kii aswadaniyata kaa vichaar karte hue use brahmanand sahodar, swaprakashanand, vilakshan aadi bataaya jaataa he or is aadhaar par sabhi rason ko anandatmak mana gaya he
 Bhattnayak has indicated the beauty of all the juices by showing mritva-paratva-inferior condition due to Sattvodrak, Abhinavagupta, Nirvigna's realization and Anandavardhan stating the state of melody and humidity in Karuna as Shringar, Vipralambha and Karuna progressively flourishing
 kintu anukoolvedaniyata tathaa pratikulvedaniyata ke aadhaar par bhaavon kaa vivechan karke rudrabhatt ramchandra gunachandra, haripal, tathaa dhananjay ne or hindi main acharya ramchandra shukla ne rason kaa sukhaatmak tathaa du:khaatmak anubhuthavaala mana he
 Abhinavagupta had first introduced the theory of "sukhu: Khasbhavono Ras:" in "abhinavabharati"
 sukhaatmak rason main shringaar, vir, hasya, adbhut tathaa shant kii or du:khaatmak main karun, raudra, bibhats tathaa bhayanak kii gananaa kii gai
 By giving the example of "pancaras", it has been proved that in the Panc juice made by mixing jaggery, Mirich etc
, there is a peculiar kind of taste, not knowing the sour sweetness of different items, it is also said that that picture In the same way, in a proportionate way, sometimes sour, sometimes hard, and so on, the taste of other types comes
 madhusudan saraswati kaa kathan he ki raj athwa tam kii apeksha satv ko pradhan maan lene par bhi yah to maananaa hi chahie ki anshat: unka bhi aswaad bana rahata he
 Acharya Shukla is of the opinion that the feeling we have is of the described sense and the expressions are of a dry, sadistic nature, etc
 Therefore, the rasa will also be of both types
 duusari ore rason ko anandatmak maanane ke pakshpaati sahrudayon ko hi iskaa praman maanate hai or tark kaa sahaara lete hai ki du:khadaayi vastu bhi yadi apni priy he to sukhadaayi hi prathit hoti he
 For example, at the time of the night, a woman feels pain in her body, but at that time she considers it a pleasure
 bhoj tathaa vishwanath kii is dharna ke atirikt swayan madhusudan saraswati rason ko loukik bhaavon kii anubhuti se bhinn or vilakshan maanakar inaki anandatmakataa kaa samarthan karte he or abhinavgupt vitvighnaprathit vatakar is dharna ko spasht karte hai ki usee bhav kaa anubhav bhi yadi bina vichlit hue or kisi bahari athwa antarodbhoot antaraay ke bina kiya jaataa he to vah sahya hone ke kaaran anandatmak hi kehalaata he
 If you consider it to be sorrowful, then consider the distinction of adornment as sad as well, then why should the distinction of adornment be considered sorrowful? By giving many such arguments, the conformity of the juices is proved
 angreji main tragedy se milanevaale anand kaa bhi anek prakaar se samaadhaan kiya gaya he or marathi lekhakon ne bhi rason kii aanandarupata ke sambandh main paryaapt bhinn dharanaayen prastut kii hai
 Often, the notion of considering Ras as the same in the traditional form has been prevalent, considering the different names of the juices as official or formal authority
 bharat ne "na hi rasaadrute kashchidpyarth : pravartat" pankti main "ras" shabd kaa ek vachan main prayog kiya he or abhinavgupt ne uparilikhit dharna vyakt kii he
 Bhoja has treated Shringar as the only juice and has always interpreted it differently, according to Vishwanath, Narayan Pandit considers the miraculous miracle to be the only juice, because miracle is the form
 bhawabhooti ne karun ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar usee se sabaki utpatti bataai he or bharat ke "swan swan nimittamasadya shantadbhav: pravartate, punarnimittapaye c shant evopaliyate" - vaktavy ke aadhaar par shant ko hi ekmaatr ras mana ja saktaa he
 Similarly, on the basis of the server-friendly state of excitement and amazement, they can also be considered at the root of all other juices
 ras aswaad or anand ke rup main ek akhand anubhuti maatr hai, yah ek paksh he or ek hi ras se anya rason kaa udbhav hua he yah doosraa paksh he
 In the idea of rasapradhanya, the problem of rajrajata has arisen
 bharat samast shuchi, ujwal, medhya or dalneey ko shringaar maanate hai, "agnipurana" shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras bataakar anya sabko usee ke bhed maanata he, bhoj shringaar ko hi mul or ekmaatr ras maanate hai, parantu uplabdh likhit pramaan ke aadhaar par "rasraj" shabd kaa prayog "ujjvalaneelamani" main bhakthiras ke liye hi dikhaai detaa he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas considers Shringar to be the origin of all Rasas and Rasavayak Dev
 "rasraj" sangya kaa shringaar ke liye prayog matiram dwaara hi kiya gaya miltaa he
 On the other hand, Banarasidas declares "navamo Sant Rasani Ko Nayak" in the play "samayasara"
 rasarajata kii sweekruti vyapaktaa, utkar aswadyata, anya rason ko antarbhoot karne kii kshamta sabhi sanchaariyon tathaa saatvikon ko ant:saat karne kii shakti sarvapranisulabhtv tathaa shighragrahyata aadi par nirbhar he
 All these things are found in as much and strong makeup, not in other juices
 at: rasraj vahi kehalaata he
 The king of Raso is considered to be Shringar Ras
 vichaarco ne raudra tathaa karun ko chhodkar shesh rason kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The most detailed description of these is that of dressing
 shringaar mukhyat: sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kintu dhananjay aadi kuch vidvan vipralambh ke purvanurag bhed ko sanyog-vipralambh-virahit purvavastha maanakar ayog kii sangya dete hai tathaa shesh viprayog tathaa sambhog naam se do bhed or karte hai
 On the basis of many circumstances of coincidence, it is considered to be invisible and it is distinguished only by the idea of asylum, heroic or amphibious, disguised with the idea of publication and light or clear and secret and secret and narrow, narrow, prosperous and prosperous with the idea of publication type and The antecedents or aspirations of Vipralambha, Maan or Ishratheetuk, Migration, Viraha and Karun Pralambha were distinguished
 Huh
 "kavyprakash" kaa virahahetuk nayaa he or shaapahetuk bhed pravaas ke hi antargat gruhit ho saktaa he, "sahityadarpan" main karun vipralambh kii kalpana kii gai he
 From the point of view of antecedent reason, on the basis of virtue and brightness, brightness, eye-sighting, imagery, dream and indraja-darshana-jagya and raga are divided into blue, kusumbha and manjistha
 "alankarikoustubh" main sheeghra nasht honevaale tathaa shobhit na honevaale raag ko "haridr" naam se chauthaa bataaya he, jise unka tikaakar "shyamaraag" bhi kahata he
 The predicaments of the predecessor - Abhilash, Anxiety, Reminiscence, Gunakirtana, Udveg, Lament, Vyadhi, Inertia and Death - have been considered, in whose place Vishnu Dharmadartyapurana as the opinion of his own and elsewhere, the commentary of the tentacular, the lechery, the glorification And with a slight change in Saraswathikantharan and poetry, Chakshuprithi, mind, remembrance, sleeplessness, tanuta, vocation, shame, mania, Uchrchha and has been mentioned death
 shaardatnay ne ichha tathaa uthkanthaa ko jodakar tathaa vidyanath ne samaran ke sthaan par sankalp laakar or pralaap tathaa sanjvar ko badhaakar inaki sankhya 12 maani he
 It is not rational and can have an inbreeding effect
 maan-vipralambh pranay tathaa ishrya ke vichaar se do prakaar kaa tathaa maan kii sthirataa tathaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke vichaar se laghu, madhyam tathaa guru naam se teen prakaar kaa, pravasvipralambh kaaryaj, shaapaj, sanbhramaj naam se teen prakaar kaa or kaaryaj ke yasyatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhootpravas, shaapaj ke tadrupya tathaa vairupy, tathaa sambhramaj ke utpaat, vaat, divya, maanush tathaa parachakradi bhed ke kaaran kai prakaar kaa hota he
 Due to the closeness of Virah Gurujnadi, even after being close, the disconnection of the heroine and the hero coinciding and Karun Vipralambha is the hope of union by resurrection even after death
 shringaar ras ke antargat nayikalankar, ritu tathaa prakruti kaa bhi varnan kiya jaataa he
 An example is- isi prakaar sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit shringaar ras kaa udhaaharan- Distinguishing the self, lust, dislocated, subjugated, hijacked and overbearing from the potentiality of humor and the development of humor and development of humor, making three distinctions from their superior, medium and unholy nature, the two aforesaid distinctions were placed respectively
 has gone
 hindi main keshavadas tathaa ekaadh anya lekhak ne keval mandahas, kalhas, atihaas tathaa parihaas naamak chaar hi bhed kiye hai
 Many other names of humor based on English have also become popular
 udhaaharan - New example- shant kaa koi bhed nahin he
 Only Rudrabhatta has definitely given four distinctions under the names Vairagya, Doshanigraha, Santhosh and Tattvakshakshpatakara which are mere names and their number can also be increased
 udhaaharan - In the eight dramas propounded in Bharatamuni's 'natyashastra', the difference between Shringar and Humor and Karun Rasa before Rudra was calculated
 ‘raudratu karuno ras:’ kahkar 'karun ras' kii utpatti 'raudra ras' se maani gai he or uski utpatti shaapjanya klesh vinipat, ishtjan-viprayog, vibhav naash, vadh, bandhan, vidrav arthath palaayan, apaghaat, vyasan arthath aapatti aadi vibhaavon ke sanyog se sweekaar kii he
 Also nirved, guilt, worry, adulation, impulse, fascination, labor, fear, sadness, pity, sickness, inertia, hysteria, epiphany, tragedy, laziness, death, stanza, vapathu, vevarnya, teardrop, swearing etc
 Calculated as an expression
 udhaaharan - In poetic juices, there is an important place for raudra rasa
 bharat ne ‘naatyashaastra’ main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats, in chaar rason ko hi pradhan mana he, at: inhen se anya rason kii utpatti bataayi he, yatha-‘teshamutpattihetavakshatvaaro rasa: shringaaro rodro vero vibhats iti’
 Describing the origin of Karun Rasa from Raudra, Bharata says that 'raudrasyaiv ch yatkam sa shey: Karuno rasa:'
 raudra ras kaa karm hi karun ras kaa janak hota he
 The 'permanent emotion' of the raudra rasa is 'anger' and its character is blood and the deity Rudra
 keshavadas kii ‘ramachandrika’ se raudra ras kaa udhaaharan pehle hi ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 Examples of raudra rasa are also found in Bhushan's compositions
 vartmaan kaal main shyaamanarayan pandeya tathaa ‘dinakar’ kii rachanaaon main raudra ras kii prabhavakaari vyanjana hui he
 In the Sanskrit texts, 'mahabharata' and 'veeracharit', 'venichabhika' etc
 plays have had a powerful expression of the raudra rasa
 udhaaharan - Along with Shringar, Raudra and Vibhats, Veeraras is also enumerated by Bharata Muni in the original rasas
 vir ras se hi adbhut ras kii utpatti batalaai gai he
 The 'varna' of Veer Ras is called 'swarna' or 'gaur' and the god Indra
 yah uttam prakruti waalo se sambaddh he tathaa iskaa sthaayee bhav ‘utsaah’ he
 Only Yudveer, Dharmaveer, Dayavir and Danveer distinction of Veer Ras are accepted
 utsaah ko aadhaar maanakar panditraj aadi ne anya anek bhed bhi kiye hai
 Examples - adbhut ras ke bharatmuni ne do bhed ie hai- divya tathaa anandaj 
 The Vaishnava Acharya makes a distinction called vision, श्रrut, Sankrit and Anumit
 bibhats bharat tathaa dhananjay ke anusaar shuddh, kshobhan tathaa udayegi naam se teen prakaar kaa hota he
 Three types are considered to be derogatory or illusory, criminological or imaginary, and three types of dissonant or real name, and two types of self-directed distinction from terrible causation
 sthayibhaavon ke kisi vishesh lakshan athwa rason ke kisi bhav kii samanta ke aadhaar par praaia: rason kaa ek duusare main antarbhaav karne, kisi sthayibhav kaa tiraskaar karke naveen sthaayee maanane kii pravriti bhi yada-kada dikhaai padi he
 As such, among Shanta Rasa and Dayavir and Vibhats, Dayavir's intrusion into calm and unhappy permanent Jugupsa is considered permanent
 "naganand" naatak ko koi shant kaa or koi dayavir ras kaa naatak maanata he
 But if the metaphysical pause of calm and compassionate zeal of Dayavir is noted, then there will be a difference between the two
 isi prakaar jugupsa main jo vikarshan he vah shant main nahin rahata
 Quiet ragas-malice is both inclusiveness and metaphysics, in which jugupsa can become communicable
 thik aise jaise karun main bhi sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar rahata he or dayavir main bhi, kintu karun main shok kii sthiti he or dayavir main sahanubhuthaprerit aatmashaktisambhoot aanandarup utsaah kii
 Or, just as both Raudra and Yudhveer have an enemy, so both have the amount of anger, but the rapture in Prahodratikul acuteness and indiscretion, and Yudhveer have a ferocity and prudence
 krodh main shatruvinaash main pratishodh kii bhaavana rahati he or vir main dhairya or udaartaa
 Therefore, their mutual interaction is not possible
 isi prakaar "anmarsh" ko vir kaa sthaayee maananaa bhi uchit nahin, kyonki amarsh ninda, apmaan yaa akshepadi ke kaaran chitt ke abhinivesh yaa swabhimanavbodh ke rup main prakat hota he, kintu viraras ke dayavir, daanveer, tathaa dharmaveer naamak bhedon main is prakaar kii bhaavana nahin rahati

 Rahim has chosen for example in poetry the scripts of texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana and Gita and has tried to explain the temporal life behavior aspect by him, which offers a glimpse of Indian culture
 abdurrarahim khaankhaana kaa janm sanwat 1613 i
 main itihaas prasiddh bairam khan ke ghar lahore main hua tha
 Incidentally at that time, Humayun was present with the military in Lahore to resist the invasion of Alexander Suri
 bairam khan ke ghar putr kii utpati kii khabar sunakar ve swayan vahaan gayi or us bachche kaa naam “rahim’ rakhaa
 Rahim's father Bairam Khan was the tantrum and guardian of thirteen-year-old Akbar

 He was the brother-in-law and intimate friend of Humayun
 rahim kii maan vartmaan haryana praant ke mewati rajput jamaal khan kii sundar evam gunavati kanya sultanaa begum thi
 When Rahim was five years old, his father Bairam Khan was killed in 1561 in Patan Nagar, Gujarat
 rahim kaa paalan-poshan akbar ne apane dharm-putr kii tarah kiya
 As a royal dynasty, Rahim was given the title of 'mirza Khan'
 rahim ne baba jambur kii dekh-rekh main gahan adhyayan kiya
 At the end of education, Akbar got Rahim married to his daughter's daughter Mahabano
 iske baad rahim ne gujarat, kumbhalaner, udaipur aadi yudhon main vijay praapt kii
 On this, Akbar honored Rahim with the highest title of his time, 'mirarj'
 san 1584 main akbar ne rahim ko khan-e-khaanaa kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya
 Rahim died in 1627 at the age of 71
 rahim ko unki ichha ke anusaar dilli main hi unki patni ke makbare ke paas hi dafna diya gaya
 These mausoleums are still present in Delhi
 rahim ne swayan hi apane jeevankaal main iskaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 Humayun chose Bairam Khan for the education of Crown Prince Akbar and appointed Akbar's guardian in the last days of his life, giving him the responsibility of managing the state
 bairam khan ne kushal niti se akbar ke rajya ko majboot banane main puraa sahyog diya
 For some reason there was a difference of opinion between Bairam Khan and Akbar
 akbar ne bairam khan ke vidroh ko safaltaapurvak dabaa diya or apane ustad kii maan evam laaj rakhte hue use haj par jane kii ichha jataai
 As a result, Bairam Khan left for Haj
 bairam khan haj ke liye jate hue gujarat ke patan main tehre or patan ke prasiddh sahasraling sarovar main nauka-vihaar ke baad tat par baithe the ki bhent karne kii niyat se ek afgaan sardaar mubarak khan aayaa or dhokhe se bairam khan kii hatya kar di

 Not only did these fraudsters commit murder, but they also caused a lot of looting

 As soon as Akbar came to know about the incident, he sent a message to Sultana Begum to return to the court
 raste main sandesh paakar begum akbar ke darbar main aa gai
 At such a time, Akbar, giving proof of his greatness, gave shelter to him with great generosity and said to Rahim, "keep it happy in all ways
" ise yah pataa na chale ki inke pita khan khaanaan kaa saaya sar se uth gaya he
 Baba said to Jambur that this is our son
 ise hamaari drushti ke saamne rakhaa karo
 In this way, Akbar raised Rahim just like a son of religion
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat akbar ne vidhwaa sultanaa begum se vivaah kar liya
 Akbar honored Rahim with the title of "mirza Khan" as per the royal family
 rahim kii shiksha- diksha akbar kii udaar dharm- nirpeksh niti ke anukool hui
 Due to this education, the poetry of Rahim remains a thunderous neck of the Hindus even today
 dinakar ji ke kathananusaar akbar ne apane deen-ilaahi main hindootv ko jo sthaan diya hoga, usase kai guna zyada sthaan rahim ne apni kavitaaon main diya
 It is said about Rahim that he was a Muslim by religion and a pure Indian by culture

 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended
 rahim ke vivaah se bairam khan or mirza ke bich chali aa rahi puraani ranjish khatm ho gayi
 Rahim was married at the age of about sixteen

 baitool gajetir ke anusaar is kile ko raja il - el ne banaaya tha jisaki rajdhani elizepur vartmaan achalpur maharashtïr thi
 It was King Eel who built the caves of Ajanta Ellora which were later called Ellora in the name of King eel-el
 kherala par raaj karne vaale ek anya raja jaitpal kaa zikr padhgaye ko miltaa he jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki uske paas paras pathar tha jiskaa upyog vah lohe ko sona banane main karata tha
 During the tenure of this king, all the useful items made of iron, such as gatchi, sabbal, ax, shovel, of non-taxing farmers, which he later made gold from Paras stone, were kept in his treasury
 apaar sona hone ke chakkar main hi logo ne is kile ko aaj khandahar kaa rup de diya
 The king had to bear the brunt of having the Philosopher's Stone several times because every rival ruler used to climb that fort only to get the Paras stone
 marathi ke ek maatr praachin ganrath vivek sindhu main kherala rajvansh kii kai kahanio ko is granth ke rachayita mukundraj swami ne likhaa he
 According to a public opinion, after being harassed by repeated invasions and battles - in the end, in the end, King Jaitpal built the Paras stone in front of this fort to protect him from the fear that the priceless Paras stone would not go near the Mughals
 Throwed in the pond of Ravanwadi
 mughalo ke baad jab agreji shashan aayaa or use bhi is kile ke raja dghaara ravanwari ke talab main paras pathar hone kii baat pataa chali to ve bhi use paane ke liye bharsak prayaas kiye jisamen angrejo dghaara ravanwari ke talab ke chaaro ore haathiyo ke paanv main lohe kii sakal - chaiyn ko baandh kar use talab ke chaaro ore ghumaane tathaa usamen ki ek maatr lohe kii chaiyn - sakal ke sone ban jane kii bhi janashruti sunne ko milti he
 There is also a story to hear and read about the battle between Mughal commander Rehman Shah Dulha from another king l-eel of this fort of mixed Gound and Rajput kings
 vivek sindhu ke anusaar mughal senapati kaa or jaitpal kaa yudgh hua tha lekin elizepur vartmaan achalpur main rahamaan shah dulha ke dhad kii majaar ke paas bani raja il kii majaar is kahani ko jhutlaati he
 According to him, Rehman Shah Dulha and King Il were killed
 magal senapati maaraa gaya lekin raja il ke marane kii kahani kuch alag hi sunne ko milti he
 However, at one time Kherala must have been a powerful state with 35 parganas apart from Nimar
 13 ve evam 14 ve tathaa15 ve sadi ke daur main kherala rajvansh kaa itihaas kaaphi romaanchakaari evam dil ko dahala dene vaali shauryagaathaon se bharaa hua he
 Today, in the absence of governmental neglect and care, the fortress of Kherla has become the identity of an oriental India
 
 yun to hamaare desh ke kai raja-maharaajaaon ke kile unke dwaara jamaa kiye gayi prachur khajaanon se bhare pade hai 
 vishwa ke jane- maane itihaaskaar tolami ke anusaar vartmaan kaal kaa baitool beete kal ke akhand bharat kaa kendra bindu tha
 This betul was in possession of a king named Kondali from 130 to 161 BCE, who believed himself to be of the Gound caste
 is akhand bharat kaa kendra bindu kaha jane vaale baitool jile par yan to gond raja- maharaajaaon kii kai peedhisho ne kai sadiyo tak raaj kiya
 It was only after the Mughal invasion that the Kherala dynasty fort of 35 Pargano was renamed as Mehmedabad under the agreement reached by the Mughals after their reluctance
 baitool jila mukhyalay se lagbhag das kimi kii dur par sthit aitihaasik mahatv kii dharohar kahalaane vaala khedla kila aaj bhi jeern-sheern avasthaa main maujuud he
 The lifeless stones of the walls of this fort, which have been converted into ruins, shout the vandalism of the barbaric behavior that has taken place even today, and the visitors of this place are shocked for a moment
 itihaas ke pannon par apana svarnim naam ankit kara chuke is kile ke bare main anek kisse kahaniyaan sunne ko milti he
 Even today, the same stories continue to cause excavation in these kilos
 baitool jila mukhyalay se maatr das kilo meter kii duuri par sthit ravanwari urf khedla gram ke paas sthit khedla kaa kila kii kai baar khudaai ho chuki he
 According to a legend, the largest pond in Betul district, built on 22 hectares of land in front of the fort, contains a gold Sun Temple
 is mandir ke liye kai baar khudaai ho chuki lekin bich talab main mandir ke dhanse hone ke kaaran use chaaro ore se hajaaro ton mitt ke malbe ko aaj tak koi bhi purna rup se nikaal baahar kar paaya he
 According to a superstition prevalent among the people around this temple, the excavator of the temple is demanded in his dream that if he wants to find the hidden treasures in the temple then he should first take his first son and first You will have to give the sacrifice of daughter-in-law
 Today, this is the reason that no one has been able to reach the temple
 dusraa sachai yah he ki aaj jis vyakti kii tathakthith pariwarik sampati bane is talab se beete varsh gram panchayat ne khudaai karke saikado tector taali mitt logo ke kheto main daali he jo aaj in logo ko bharpoor paidaavar de rahi he
 According to another story, there was a very severe famine in the city of King Jaitpal
 Due to drought and famine, the Alam of trisi-tahi spread among the subjects
 tab koi sant vahaan se gujarey 
 raja ne unki aavbhagat kar unase rajya main faile sookhe va akaal ke nidaan kaa upaay poocha
 raja il ke aatithy se prasann mahatma ne raja il se kaha ki vah apane kil ke thik saamne 22 acre kii bhoomi par talab khudwaye tathaa us talab kii khudaai ke baad us talab ke bich bich bhagwaan bholenath ke mandir kaa banavaa kar uske paraas shivlinga kii sthapana kar uski pratham puja apane pehle putr va putr vadhoo se karawaaye saath hi surya ke taap ko kam karne ke liye use bhagwaan surya kaa sone kaa bhavy mandir banvaanaa hoga agar vah aisa karata he to uske rajya main tathaa is talab main kabhi pani kii kami nahin aegi
 mahatma kii sikh ke anusaar jab raja ne apane putr va vadhu mandir sthapana ke baad pujan ke liye bheja tab putr va vadhu kaa pujan puraa bhi nahin hua tha ki vah sthaan puraa kaa puraa jalmagn ho gaya or raja or uske putr evam vadhu us jal main jal magr ho gaye
 Ever since the water mausoleum of King Il's son and bride, people have never felt water scarcity till date
 ek anya katha ke anusaar raja il ke paas chamatkaarik paras pathar tha jo unhen kisi mahatma ne seva se prasann hone par diya tha
 It was also forbidden to misuse it
 aaj khti vyavsaay kaa jo kar rupayon main liya jaataa he vah raja il ke jamaane main pondhara-chhani jo lohe kii hua karti thi, use kar ke badale liya jaataa tha
 King Il was touched by this miraculous philosopher's stone by depositing it in a huge tank, then he turned pieces of iron into gold
 yah kaary purnat: gupt rup se hua karata tha
 This mystery became common only after the death of the king
 itihaas kii kitabon main bhi is baat kaa ullekh maujuud he
 Also, it is mentioned that even when the head of the king was beheaded, he was doing a fierce battle
 tabhi raja kii kisi rani ne apane paas ke amuly paras pathar ko magul shashan na hathiyaa le is dar se mahal se lagbhag 1
5 kimi dur sthit bade talab main phenk diya tha
 After the invasion of the Mughals by the King of Khedla in this pond, a tale of throwing away the priceless Paras Mani near him was disturbed even to the white Agranjo
 bataaya jaataa he ki chaar haathiyo ke pairo main lohe kii majabut sakal baandh kar unhe talab ke chaaro ore ghumaya gaya tha jisamen se maatr ek hi sakal ke lohe ke hone kii sakal ke sone ke ban jane kii afvaah ne bhi is talab main kai baar logo ko khudaai karne ko majabur kar daalaa he
 The population that was inhabited at a time near the pond located about ten km from the district headquarters Betul is today known as Ravanwadi village
