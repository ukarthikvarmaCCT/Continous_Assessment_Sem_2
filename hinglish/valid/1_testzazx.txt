 According to this rule, the frequencies of different alleles and genotypes in an ideal population remain unchanged from generation to generation
 yah niyam unheen jansankhyaon par purnatah lagu hoga jo in aadarshon kaa paalan karatin hai :1
 janan keval langik ho2
 ek samay par keval ek hi peedhee jivit rahe3
 prajnan kramahin rahe4
 dono lingon kii prajnan kii sambhaavna baraabar rahe5
 jansankhya ati vishaal rahe6
 dono lingon main baraabar aleel aavritiyaan hon7
 janata pravaas, parivartan, yaa prakritik chayan se mukt ho
 8
 Do not have mutation
 kalpana kijiye ek dwiguneet jansankhya jisamen aleel a tathaa a kaa mishran ho or inaki aavritiyaan hon f = p { \ displaystyle f=p} tathaa f = q { \ displaystyle f=q} jo kii is prakaar nirdhaarit kii gayi hon ki p + q = 1 { \ displaystyle p+q=1} 
 By extracting the frequencies of the genotype on their strength, we find that f = p 2 { \ displaystyle f = p ^ {2}}, f = 2 pq { \ displaystyle f = 2pq}, and f = q 2 { \ displaystyle f = q ^ {2}}
 ham yah bhi pate hai ki f + f + f = 2 = 1 { \ displaystyle f+f+f=^{2}=1}, jisase hamen anuvanshik santulan kii prapti hoti he
 To understand the origin of this rule, imagine a diploid organism in which DNA of a gene establishing any one type of form is formed
 In A, which is called a place, two types of alleles a and a can be established
 ek udhaaharan hoga matar ke rang kii jin jiske do aleel lijiye, ek haraa rang dene vaala g tathaa doosraa pilaa rang dene vaala g
 Now because the pea is a diploid organism, these alleles determine each allele in pairs, such as gg, gg, or fir gg; One such pair is called genotype
 ek jodidar pita se praapt hota he or doosraa mata se
 One of these pairs can be effective and the other is ineffective, such that g is effective here and g is ineffective
 iskaa arth yah he ki yadi matar main GG yaa Gg main se koi bhi jodi hui, to uskaa rang haraa hoga; or yadi jodi gg hui to keval tabhi rang pilaa hoga
 Now imagine that the frequencies of a and a are in the first generation f 0 = p { \ displaystyle f_ {0} = p}, f 0 = q { \ displaystyle f_ {0} = q}, thus determining that p + q = 1 { \ displaystyle p + q = 1}
 is peedhee kii santati se yukt dwitiya peedhee main kramshah AA, Aa, tathaa aa ginotip kii aavritiyaan lijiye f 1 { \ displaystyle f_{1}}, f 1 { \ displaystyle f_{1}}, tathaa f 1 { \ displaystyle f_{1}}, is prakaar nirdhaarit ki f 1 + f 1 + f 1 = 1 { \ displaystyle f_{1}+f_{1}+f_{1}=1} 
 These instances can be written as probabilities in p { \ displaystyle p} and q { \ displaystyle q}: f 1 = p 2 { \ displaystyle f_{1}=p^{2}} f 1 = p q + q p = 2 p q { \ displaystyle f_{1}=pq+qp=2pq} f 1 = q 2 { \ displaystyle f_{1}=q^{2}} Now any allele of a genotype in every creature of the second generation can come either from the mother or from the father
 jaise agar santan main a he, to uske mata-pita yaa to dono se ek ek a praapt hua hoga, athwa aadhi sambhaavna ke saath keval kisi ek main se a praapt hua hoga 
 Hence the frequency of a in this second generation will be f 1 = f 1 + 1 2 f 1 = p 2 + 1 2 = p = p = f 0 { \ displaystyle f_{1}=f_{1}+{ \ frac {1}{2}}f_{1}=p^{2}+{ \ frac {1}{2}}=p=p=f_{0}} f 1 = f 1 + 1 2 f 1 = q 2 + 1 2 = q = q = f 0 { \ displaystyle f_{1}=f_{1}+{ \ frac {1}{2}}f_{1}=q^{2}+{ \ frac {1}{2}}=q=q=f_{0}} This proves that the frequencies of both alleles will remain unchanged from generation to generation
 hamane yahan p + q = 1 { \ displaystyle p+q=1} kaa upar prayog kiya he
 No population will be able to fully adhere to the ideals given above, because migration, change, or natural selection are constantly moving in any population
 inke hi kaaran kai baar kuch drishy swaroop nasht hone lagate hai to inhen ke kaaran nae swaroop bhi prakat hote or prafullit hote rahete hai
 To illustrate this, we can take the example of natural selection
 firase ek adarsh jansankhya kii kalpana kijiye or kisi swaroop ke do yugmaviklpiyon a tathaa a kii praarambhik aavritiyaan, sari peedhee ke udbhav ke turant uparaant, lijiye f 0 = p { \ displaystyle f_{0}=p} evam f 0 = q { \ displaystyle f_{0}=q} 
 Now suppose that the probability of survival of any AA, Aa, or aa type of animal, respectively, is ω AA { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {AA}}, ω a a { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {aa}} , Or ω aa { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {aa}}
 agar ye tino baraabar hote, to in prakaaron ke praaniyon kaa anupaat hotah f 0 : f 0 : f 0 = p 2 : 2 p q : q 2 { \ displaystyle f_{0}:f_{0}:f_{0}=p^{2}:2pq:q^{2}} tathaa yahi anupaat agali peedhee ke praaniyon main bhi jaataa
 But now this ratio will be changed due to selection: f 0: f 0: f 0 = f 1: f 1: f 1 = p 2 ω AA: 2 pq ω a a: q 2 ω aa { \ displaystyle f_ {0 }: f_ {0}: f_ {0} = f_ {1}: f_ {1}: f_ {1} = p ^ {2} \ omega _ {AA}: 2pq \ omega _ {aa}:q ^ {2} \ omega _ {aa}} from which we will find that f 1 = f 1 + 1 2 f 1 = p 2 ω AA + pq ω a ap 2 ω AA + 2 pq ω a a + q 2 ω aa = p ω a ω ̄ { \ displaystyle f_ {1} = f_ {1} + { \ frac {1} {2}} f_ {1} = { \ frac {p ^ {2} \ omega _ {AA} + pq \ omega _ {aa}} {p ^ {2} \ omega _ {AA} + 2pq \ omega _ {aa} + q ^ {2} \ omega _ {aa}}} = p { \ frac { \ omega _ {A}} { \ bar { \ omega xxrep 5 } f 1 = f 1 + 1 2 f 1 = q 2 ω aa + pq ω a ap 2 ω AA + 2 pq ω a a + q 2 ω aa = q ω a ω ̄ { \ displaystyle f_ {1} = f_ {1} + { \ frac {1} {2}} f_ {1} = { \ frac {q ^ {2} \ omega _ {aa} + pq \ omega _ {aa}} {p ^ {2} \ omega _ {AA} + 2pq \ omega _ {aa} + q ^ {2} \ omega _ {aa}}} = q { \ frac { \ omega _ {a}} { \ bar { \ omega xxrep 5 } which would be different from p { \ displaystyle p} and q { \ displaystyle q} in general
 yahan ω a = p ω a a + q ω a a { \ displaystyle \ omega _{a}=p \ omega _{aa}+q \ omega _{aa}}, ω a = q ω a a + p ω a a { \ displaystyle \ omega _{a}=q \ omega _{aa}+p \ omega _{aa}}, tathaa ω ̄ = p 2 ω a a + 2 p q ω a a + q 2 ω a a { \ displaystyle { \ bar { \ omega }}=p^{2} \ omega _{aa}+2pq \ omega _{aa}+q^{2} \ omega _{aa}} 
 If ω A> ω ̄ { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {A}> { \ bar { \ omega xxrep 4 } , then the number of a in the population will increase with the generation rate and the selection will be favorable to A; But if ω a <ω ̄ { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {A} <{ \ bar { \ omega}}}, then the frequency of a will decrease, that is, the selection will be made by a against the unfavorable position of the fixed visual form
 
 mandadrushti aisa vikaar he jisamen yadhyapi baahar se netra purnat: swasth dikhaai dete hai, parantu vastut: unamem kisi bhi cheez ko spasht dekhne kii kshamta nahin rahati
 This disorder is sometimes congenital and sometimes occurs later as a result of a disease
 janm se hi drushti main kami kaa hona praaia: ek hi aankh main miltaa he
 The main cause is rotational deformity of the eye, asymmetrical vision and at the same time there is also myopia and vision impairment in that eye
 is kaaran kaa vishleshan karne par yah spasht ho jaataa he ki drushti kii yah kami janmajaat nahin, balki baad main hi utpann ho sakati he, kyonki aavartan sambandhi vikruti ko chashme dwaara thik na karne ke kaaran vastu kaa chitra thik drushtipatal par nahin banataa, jiskaa fal yah hota he ki us drushtipatal se dekhne kaa kaary liya hi nahin jaataa, jiske kaaran dekhne ke kaary main nipun bananaa to dur rahaa, drushtipatal apni prakrutipradutt shakti ko bhi kho detaa he
 This type of condition is called 'job-related retardation'
 isaliye yah aavashyak he ki janmajaat yaa shaishavkaleen motiyobind kii shalya chikitsa shidhra kara leni chahie, taaki kaary na karne ke kaaran drushtipatal apni shakti na kho de
 Visible obstruction after seven or eight years of age does not cause this type of situation

 Monotonic retardation often becomes the cause of oblique vision, because binocular vision is of no importance at this stage due to the distortion of one eye

 According to the Puranas, if a clay idol of Bhairav is worshiped near any well, it is very fruitful
 yahi kaaran he ki kuen par sthapit yah bhairav utane urjavan hai
 They are said to have been established by Bhimsen

 Sutta Pitaka is a collection of principles of Lord Buddha in the form of arguments and dialogues
 inamen gadhy samvaad hai, muktak chand hai tathaa choti-choti pracheen kahaniyaan hai
 It is divided into five bodies or collections
 
 There are five parts of this Pitaka which are called nāyaka
 nikaay kaa arth he samooh
 Small and big sutas are stored in these five parts
 isiilie ve nikaay kehalaate hai
 The word "sangeeti" has also been used for the body
 aarambh main, jab ki tripitak lipibaddh nahin tha, bhikshu ek saath sutton kaa parayan karte the
 Accordingly, his five collections were called Sangeeti
 baad main nikaay shabd kaa adhik prachlan hua or sangeeti shabd kaa bahut kam
 Many threads have a bug
 ek hi sutt ke kai bhaan bhi hote hai
 8000 letters are bhanwar
 tadnusaar ek-ek nikaay kii akshar sankhya kaa bhi nirdhaaran ho saktaa he
 For example, there are 34 suttas of longing and 64 of bhanavars
 is prakaar saare dirghanikaay main 512000 akshar hai
 The sutas contain the teachings of certain disciples like God and Sariputra Maudgalyayan, Anand
 shishyon ke upadesh bhi bhagwaan dwaara anumodith hai
 Each Sutta has a role, which has a large historical view
 usamen in maton kaa ullekh he ki kab, kis sthaan par, kis vyakti yaa kin vyaktiyon ko vah upadesh diya gaya tha or shrotaaon par uskaa kya prabhaav padaa
 Most suttas are in prose, some in verse and some in prose-verse
 ek hi upadesh kai sutton main aayaa he- kahin sankshep main or kahin vistaar main
 They have a plurality of repetitions
 unke sankshipteekaran ke liye "payyal" kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Is somewhat mature
 unamem kahin-kahin aakhyaanon or aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya he
 There is also a large stock of Sutpitaka similes

 Buddha biography, religion, philosophy, history, etc
 From all points of view, Sutpitaka is the most important part of Tripitaka
 buddhagaya ke bodhigamya ke neeche buddhatv kii prapti se lekar kushinagar main mahaparinirvana tak 45 varsh bhagwaan buddha ne jo lokseva kii, uskaa vivaran suttapitak main miltaa he
 Which Mahajanapadas he charika in the middle division, how they got mixed with people, how they paved the way from small problems to big problems, what they got in the promotion of their message Difficulties had to be faced- we get a description of all these things in Sutpitaka
 bhagwaan buddha ke jivan sambandhi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa varnan hi nahin; apitu unke mahaan shishyon kii jivan jhaankiyaan bhi isamen milti hai
 The greatest importance of suttapitaka lies in the means assigned by God
 vah sheel, samadhi or pragna rupi teen shikshaaon main nihit he
 The audience had people of many levels in terms of intelligence, moral and spiritual development
 un sabhi ke anuroop anek prakaar se unhone arya maarg kaa upadesh diya tha, jisamen panchasheel se lekar das parmitaayen tak shaamil hai
 The main religion synonyms are as follows - Four Arya Satya, Ashtangik Marg, Seven Bodhyangas, Four Samyak Pradhan Five senses, Pratitya Samutpada, Skandha Volume Metal Formed Sanskrit Religion Continuous sorrow-infinite-form Sanskrit traits
 inamen bhi santis ksheeya dharm hi bhagwaan ke upadeshon kaa saar he
 He wrote this in Mahaparinirvana Sutta
 yadi ham bhagwaan ke mahatvapurn upadeshon kii drushti se sutton kaa vishleshnatmak adhyayan karen to hamen unamem ghuma firaakar ye hi dharmaparyaay milenge
 The only difference is that they are brief and in some detail
 udaahranarth sutt nikaay ke praarambhik sutton main chaar satyon kaa ullekh maatr miltaa he, dhammachakkapavattan sutt main vistrut vivaran miltaa he or mahasatipatthan main inaki vishad vyakhya bhi milti he
 The main theme of Sutas is the religion and philosophy of Tathagata
 lekin prakarantar se or vishyon par bhi prakaash padataa he
 Other Shramana and Brahmin sects such as complex, parivrajaka, ajivak and nigantha which were prevalent at that time, have also been described in statutes

 Somewhere there was royalty rule and somewhere republican state
 unka aapas kaa sambandh kaisaa tha, shashan prashasan kaary kaise hote the- in baton kaa bhi ullekh kahin-kahin miltaa he
 The state of ordinary people, their way of living, ethics, food storage, industry, business, education, initiation, arts, knowledge, science, entertainment, sports etc
 have also been described
 gram, nigam, rajdhani, janapad, nadi, parvat, van, tadaag, maarg, ritu aadi bhugolic baton kii bhi charchaa kam nahin he
 Thus we see that the importance of Sutpitaka is not only in terms of religion and philosophy, but also in terms of political, social and geographical position of Buddha India

 albert oinstin kaa janm germany main wootemberg ke ek yahudee parivaar main hua
 His father was an engineer and salesman
 unki maan paulin oinstin thi
 Although Einstein had difficulty speaking initially, he topped the studies
 unki maatrubhaasha german thi or baad main unhone italvi or angreji bhi sikhi
 In 1880 his family moved to the city of Munich, where his father and uncle jointly opened a company called "electrotechnic Frébich J
 Einstein & See", which manufactured electrical appliances
 or isane munich ke Oktoberfest meley main pehali baar roshni kaa prabandh bhi kiya tha
 His family did not believe in Jewish religious traditions, and for this reason Einstein could go to Catholic school
 apni maan ke kehane par unhone sarangi bajaanaa siikhaa
 He did not like this and later abandoned it, but later he enjoyed Mozart's Sarangi music
 1894 main, unke pita kii company ko munich shahar main vidyut prakaash vyavastha ke liye aapurti karne kaa anubandh nahin mil sakaa
 Due to the loss, he had to sell his company
 vyapaar kii talash main, oinstin parivaar italy chale gaye, jahaan ve sabase pehle milan or phir kuch maheene baad pavia shahar main bas gayi
 Even after the family left for Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to complete his studies
 disambar 1894 ke ant main, unhone pavia main apane parivaar se milane italy kii yatra kii
 During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay titled "examining the state of the ether in a magnetic field"
 apane puure jeevankaal main, oinstin ne saikadon kitaaben or lekh prakashit kiye
 He published more than 300 scientific and 150 non-scientific research papers
 1965 ke apane vyaakhyaan main, oppenheimar ne ullekh kiya ki oinstin ke praarambhik lekhan main kai trutiyon hoti thi jiske kaaran unke prakaashan main lagbhag das varshon kii deree ho chuki thi: " ek aadmi jiskaa trutiyon ko hi sahi karne main ek lanbaa samay lage, kitna mahaan hoga"
 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more
 
 Anus Mirabilis Papers is related to four articles that Einstein published in 1905 in a scientific journal called Onlen der Physik, which included photoelectric effects, Brownian motion, special relativism, and e = mc2
 in chaar lekhon ne aadhunik bhautikee kii neenv ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he or antariksh, samay tathaa dravya par logo kii soch ko badla he
 These four papers are: san 1900 main onalen der physic ko prastut, oinstin ke pehla shodh-patr "keshika aakarshan" par tha
 It was published in 1901 with the title "extracts from capillary phenomena"
 1902-1903 main prakashit do patron main parmanuviya ghatana kii vyakhya, sankhyikeey ke madhyam se karne kaa prayaas kiya
 This paper formed the foundation for a 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian motion can be used as concrete evidence for the presence of molecules
 1903 or 1904 main unka shodh mukhya rup se, prasar ghatana par parimit parmaanu aakaar kaa asar par sambandhit rahe
 He expressed the principle of relativity
 jo ki harman minkovski ke anusaar antariksh se antariksh-samay ke bich baari-baari se parivartanheenata ke samanyikaran ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Other theories that Einstein coined and later proved to be correct included the principle of equality and the theory of temperate normalization of quantum numbers
 oinstin ke "chalit nikaayon ke bijli kaa gativigyaan par" shodh-patr 30 june 1905 ko purna hua or usee varsh kii 26 sitambar ko prakashit hua
 This establishes harmony between Maxwell's equation of electricity and magnetism and the theory of mechanics, after major changes in mechanics close to the speed of light

 In a 1905 paper, Einstein explained that light itself is made up of local particles
 oinstin ke prakaash quanta pariklpana ko maiks plank or niles bor sahit lagbhag sabhi bhautikavidon, ne asweekaar kar diya
 This hypothesis was universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Mulliken's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and the Compton scattering measurements
 oinstin ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aavriti kii prayek lahar, urja ke prayek photonon ke sangrah ke saath judaa hota he 
 He did not say more about this, because he was not sure how particles are related to waves
 lekin unhone suzav diya kii he,ki is pariklpana ko kuch prayogtmak parinaamon dwaara samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai jise hi baad main vishesh rup se prakashavidyut prabhaav kaha gaya
 In 1907, Einstein proposed a model that each atom oscillates independently in a lattice structure
 oinstin model main, prayek parmaanu swatantra rup se dolan karata he oinstin ko pataa tha ki vaastavik dolanon kii aavriti alag hoti hai lekin phir bhi is siddhant kaa prastaavit kiya, kyonki yah ek spasht pradarshan tha ki kaise kwantum yantriki, parmparik yantriki main vishisht garmi kii samasya ko hal kar saktaa hai
 Peter debai refined this model
 1910 ke dashak ke dauraan, alag-alag pranaaliyon ko kwantum yantriki ke daayre main laane ke liye iskaa vistaar hua
 Following the discovery of Ernest Rutherford's nucleus, and the proposition that electrons revolve around planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the discrete motion of electrons in atoms of elements by quantum mechanical, initiated by Planck and developed by Einstein And the periodic table of the elements can be explained
 1898 ke wilhem viena ke tark ko iske saath jod kar oinstin ne iske vikaas main yogadan diya
 Vienna showed that, by the hypothesis of a thermodynamic variability of a thermal equilibrium state, all black rotations at different temperatures can be derived from each other by a simple transfer process
 1911 main oinstin ne yah paaya kii vahi samoshna siddhant yah dikhaata hai kii maatra jo kisi bhi yantric gati main pramaathran he ko ek sthiroshm aparivartaneey hona chahie
 Arnold Summerfield identified temperate invertebrates as dynamic variables in traditional mechanics

 Most animals are moving, that is, they can move on their own and independently
 zyaadaatar jantu parposhi bhi hote hai, arthath ve jeene ke liye duusare jantu par nirbhar rahete hai
 The maximum known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian eruption 542 million years ago
 shabd 'animal' latin bhashaa ke shabd animale, nauter of animalis, se aayaa he or anima se vyutpann hua he, jiskaa arth he jivit shwaas yaa aatma
 In common colloquial language, the term is used for non-human animals
 is shabd kii jaivik paribhaasha main maanav sahit kingdom animalya ke sabhi sadsy shaamil hai
 Animals have many special qualities that differentiate them from other living things
 jantu eukeriotic or bahu koshikeey hote hai,, jo unhen jeevanu va adhikansh protista se alag karte hai
 They are heterotrophic, usually digesting food in an inner chamber, which makes them distinct from plants and algae, they can also be differentiated from plants, algae and fungi because they lack a hard cell wall
 All animals are moving, even if they are in a particular phase of life
 adhiktam jantuon main, bhrun ek blastula avasthaa se hokar gujarata he, yah jantuon kaa ek vibhedak gun he
 With few exceptions, most notably sponges and placozoa, the bodies of animals differentiate into different tissues
 in main mansapeshiyaan shaamil hai, jo sankuchan tathaa gati ke niyantran main sakasham hoti hai or tantrika utak, jo sanket bhejtaa he va un par pratikriya karata he
 They also have a typical internal digestive chamber consisting of 1 or 2 holes
 jin jantuon main is prakaar kaa sanghathan hota he, unhen metazon kaha jaataa he, yaa tab eumetazon kaha jaataa he jab, purv kaa prayog saamaanya rup se jantuon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 All animals have eukaryotic cells, which are surrounded by extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoprotein
 yah khol, asthi or kantak jaisi sanranchanaaon ke nirmaan ke liye kelsikrut ho sakati hai
 During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move and reorganize, creating possible complex structures
 iske vipareet, anya bahukoshikeey jeev jaise paudhe or kavak kii koshikaayen koshika bhitti se ghiri hoti hai or is prakaar se pragatisheel vruddhi dwaara viksit hoti hai
 In addition, animal cells have a unique property of intercellular joints: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes
 lagbhag sabhi jantu kisi prakaar ke langik prajnan kii prakriya se hokar guzarate hai: poliploid
 These have some specialized reproductive cells that undergo meiosis to produce small motile spermatozoa or large sedentary eggs
 ye sangalit hokar yugmanaj banaate hai, jo viksit hokar nayaa jeev banaata he
 Many animals also have asexual reproductive capacity
 yah anishekajanan ke dwaara ho saktaa he, jahaan bina nishechan ke anda bhrun main viksit ho jaataa he, kuch maamalon main vikhandeekaran ke dwaara bhi aisa sambhav he
 The zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called blastula, it undergoes a process of rearrangement and differentiation of cells
 spanj main, blastula larva tair kar ek nae sthaan par chalaa jaataa he or ek nae spanj main viksit ho jaataa he
 In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complex rearrangements
 yah pehle antar valayit hokar ek gestrula banaata he, jisamen ek pachan kaksh or do alag janan str hote hai-ek bahari bahyatvak str or ek aantarik antah tvak str
 Prey is a biological interaction in which a predator receives food from its prey
 shikari jeev apane shikaar jeev khaane se pehle maar bhi sakate hai or nahin bhi, lekin shikaar kii prakriya kaa parinaam hameshaa shikaar jeev kii mrityu hi hoti he
 Another major category of consumption is dead nutrition, consumption of dead organic matter

 The selective pressure exerted on one another has led to an evolutionary race between prey and predator, resulting in many anti-predator adaptations
 zyaadaatar jantu apratyaksh rup se surya ke prakaash se hi urja praapt karte hai
 Plants use this energy to convert sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya carbon dioxide or jal ke saath shuru hoti he, isamen surya ke prakaash kii urja ko rasinic urja main badal diya jaataa he, jo glucose ke bandhon main sanchit ho jaati he, is prakriya ke dauraan oxigen bhi mukt hoti he
 Now this sugars are used as manufacturing units, which leads to plant growth
 jab pashu in paudhon ko khate hai, paudhon ke dbaara utpann kii gayi sharkara jantuon ke dwaara kaam main le lee jaati he
 It either aids in the direct development of the animal or decomposes and is stored solar energy and thus the animal receives the energy required for movement
 yah prakriya glycolysis ke naam se jaani jaati he Animals that live close to water heat exhausts or cold seeps on the ocean floor are not dependent on the energy of the sun
 iske bajaay, rasayan sanshleshi jeev or jeevanu khaadya shrinkhalaa kaa aadhaar banaate hai
 ] aam manyata he ki jantu ek kashabhiki eukeriot se viksit hue hai
 Their closest known living relatives are the Coeno flagellum, the collard flagellum whose morphology is similar to the Coeno sites of specific sponges
 aanvik adhyayan jantuon ko ek param samooh main rakhata he, jise opisthokont kaha jaataa he, isamen bhi koeno kashabhiki, kavak or kuch chote paraseete protista ke jantu shaamil hai
 The first fossils that represent animals appeared around the end of the Precambrian period, about 610 million years ago and are called the Ediacaran or Vendian biota
 lekin inhen baad ke jeevashm se sambandhit karnaa kathin hai kuch aadhunik sanghon ke purvavartiyon kaa pratinidhitiv kar sakate hai, lekin ve alag samooh ho sakate hai or yah bhi sambhav he ki ve vastav main jantu na hon
 Except for them, the most known animal phyla appeared automatically during the Cambrian era, 542 million years ago
 yah abhi bhi vivaadit he, ki yah ghatana jise cambrian visphot kaha jaataa he, bhinn samoohon ke bich teevr vichlan kaa pratinidhitiv karti he yaa paristhitiyon main un parivartanon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he jisane jeevashmeekaran ko sambhav banaaya
 Although some archaeologists and geologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought, probably 1 billion years ago
 Fossil insignia such as trails and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of three-dimensional worms such as metazoa
 Likely earthworms would have been large and complex
 iske alaava lagbhag 1 billian varsh purv tonian yug kii shuruyaat main, stromatolait main kami aayi
 The diversity that currently informs the arrival of animals grazing as stromatolites increased diversity, shortly after the end of the Ordovician and Permian, causing large numbers of grazing marine animals to become extinct in their populations
 Shortly after the recovery, their number decreased
 vah khoj jo in praarambhik jeevashm chinhon ke bahut adhik saamaan he, unki utpatti aaj ke vishaal aakar ke ek koshikeey protista ke jeev gromia sferica ke dwaara hui he, is par praarambhik jantu ke vikaas ke pramaan ke rup main unki vyakhya par andeh he
 For a long time, sponges were considered different from other early animals
 jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, anya adhikansh sanghon main paaya jane vaala jatil sanghathan inamen nahin paaya jaataa he, unki koshikaayen vibhedit hai, lekin adhikansh maamalon main alag alag utakon main sangathit nahin hai
 The sponges are stems and usually draw water through their pores to obtain food
 aarkiokaitha, jisamen sangalit kankal hota he, vah spanj kaa yaa ek alag sangh kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he
 However, a Fellow genomic study of 150 genes in 21 species in 2008 suggests that it is Tinophora or comb jelly that forms the basis of animals in at least 21 of those associations
 lekhak vishwaas rakhte hai ki spanj yaa kam se kam ve spanj jo unhone khoje hai- itane aadim nahin hai, lekin iske bajaay dwitiyak rup se sarlikrut kiye ja sakate hai
 In other phyla, Tinophora and Nideria, including sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric, having a digestive chamber with a single pore, which serves both the mouth and the anus
 donon main spasht vibhedit utak hote hai, lekin ye angon main sangathit nahin hote hai
 There are only two main germ levels, ectoderm and endoderm, between which only the cells are scattered
 isi liye in jantuon ko kabhi kabhi diploblactic kaha jaataa he
 Small placozoa are similar, but do not have a permanent digestive chamber

 antarctic prithvi kaa iklauta mahadweep he jahaan koi manushya mul rup se nahin rahata tha or yah sandhi vyavastha antarctic ke vishay main sabhi antararashtriya sambandhon ko nirdhaarit karata he
 The Antarctic Treaty came into force from 1961 and by 2016, 53 countries had signed it
 is sandhi ke antargat antarctic ko ek vaigyanik sangrakshit kshetra ghoshit kar diya gaya or is mahadweep par kisi bhi prakaar kii sainik kaarywai par pabandi laga di gai
 Also, an annual "antarctic Treaty Consultation Meeting" tradition was initiated to decide on Antarctica cases
 jab sandhi par pehle hastakshar hue tab saat desh antarctic ke alag-alag kshetron par apni samprabhutaa kaa daawa karte the, yani un kshetron ko apane deshon kaa bhaag bataate the
 The treaty said that no signer is neither withdrawing from his claim, neither accepting the claim of anyone else nor making any new claim
 misaal ke liye france antarctic ke aadeli dharti naamak kshetra ko apana hissaa maanata he lekin sandhi ke antargat vah is daawey ko kisi or se manwaane main aksham he
 On the other hand, India does not accept the sovereignty of any country over any region of Antarctica and considers the entire continent the property of the entire human race
 antarctic sandhi main do prakaar ke sadsy desh hai - paramarshi or aparamarshi 
 According to the treaty, when the Antarctic Treaty Consultation Meeting takes place every year, the consulting countries have the right to vote on the proposals, but non-diaspora members do not have this right
 paramarshi sadsy banane ke liye kisi desh ko yah dikhaanaa hota he ki vah antarctic main anusandhan karne main sakriya he
 One aspect of this activism is to establish a research center in Antarctica where scientific teams from that country can work and live
 antarctic kaa vaataavaran kathor he or vahaan pahunchnaa bhi durgam he isaliye yah kam hi desh kar paae hai
 In 2016, out of more than 200 total countries in the world, the Antarctic Treaty had 53 members, of which only 29 held consultative status

 When Warren Hastings asked the Nawab to pay the dues to the British East India Company, he asked his mother for a loan of 26 lakh rupees and in return he gave her a four-fold price

 When he got angry and asked Chandal to move away, Chandal said- 'O Muni! You are neglecting a divine being who is in the body, therefore you are a Abraham
 atev mere maarg se aap hat jaayen
 Acharya Shankar, listening to Chandaval's devani, was very impressed and said - "you have given me knowledge, so you have become my guru
" ’ yah kahkar acharya shankar ne unhen pranaam kiya to chandal ke sthaan par shiv tathaa chaar devon ke unhen darshan hue
 During a few days stay in Kashi, he went to meet Acharya Mandan Mishra in the city of Mahishmati
 acharya mishra ke ghar jo paaltu maina thi vah bhi veda mantron kaa uccharan karti thi
 Acharya Shankar went to Mishraji's house and defeated him in scripture
 pati acharya mishra ko harata dekh patni acharya shankar se boleen- ‘mahatman! abhi aapane aadhe hi ang ko jeeta he
 Only by defeating me with your tips will you be called victorious
 ’ Then Bharti, the wife of Mishraji, started questioning Kamasastra
 kintu acharya shankar to bal-brahmacharee the, at: kaam se sambandhit unke prashnon ke uttar kahan se dete? is par unhone bharti devi se kuch dinon kaa samay maanga tathaa par-kaaya main pravesh kar us vishay kii sari jaankaree praapt kii
 After this Acharya Shankar also defeated Bharti in debate
 kaashi main pravaas ke dauraan unhone or bhi bade-bade gyani panditon ko shastrarth main parrast kiya or guru pad par pratishthit hue
 Many disciples took initiation from him
 iske baad ve dharm kaa prachaar karne lage

 Once he was going to Manikarnika Ghat with his disciples to bathe in a very narrow street in Brahma Muhurta
 raste main ek yuvati apane mrit pati kaa sir god main liye vilaap karti hui baithi thi
 The disciples of Acharya Shankar prayed to the woman to remove her husband's body and give it a way, but the woman continued to cry by ignoring him
 tab swayan acharya ne usase vah shav hataane kaa anurodh kiya
 Hearing his request, the woman said- 'O sannyasin! You are repeatedly asking me to remove this body
 aap is shav ko hi hat jane ke liye kyon nahin kehete?’ yah sunakar acharya bole- ‘he devi! aap shok main kadaachit yah bhi bhul gai ki shav main swayan hatane kii shakti hi nahin he
 'the woman immediately replied-' Mahatma, in your eyes, Brahm, the absolute power, is the doer of the world
 phir shakti ke bina yah shav kyon nahin hat saktaa?’ us stri kaa aisa gambhir, gyaanamay, rahasypurna vaakya sunakar acharya vahiin baith gaye
 He found a tomb
 ant:chakshu main unhone dekha- sarvatra aadyashakti mahamaya lila vilaap kar rahi hai
 His heart was filled with inexplicable joy and the wordy word of maternal veneration from the mouth burst into stotra
 ab acharya shankar aise mahaasaagar ban gaye, jisamen advaitvaad, shuddhadvaitvaad, vishishta dwaitvaad, nirgun brahm gyaan ke saath sagun saakaar kii bhakthi kii dharaayen ek saath hiloren lene lageen
 He realized that the divine, nirguna on the advaita land of knowledge is the formless brahm, the same is true on the land of dvaita
 unhone nirgun or sagun donon kaa samarthan karke nirgun tak pahunchne ke liye sagun kii upasna ko aprihaary seedhi mana
 On the meeting ground of knowledge and devotion, it was also realized that knowledge is the ultimate achievement of all spiritual practices
 unhone ‘brahman satyam jaganmithyaa’ kaa udghosh bhi kiya or shiv, parvati, ganesh, vishnu aadi ke bhakthiraspurn stotra bhi rache, ‘soundarya lahari’, ‘vivek chudamani’ jaise shreshthatam granthon kii rachana kii
 Wrote the departed trilogy also

 He traveled across the Asetu Himalaya Sampoorna Bharata and established four monasteries and bound the entire country into an unbroken thread of cultural, religious, philosophical, spiritual and geographical unity
 unhone samast maanav jati ko jivanmukti kaa ek sutara diya- That is, be a gentleman gentleman, be a gentleman peace

 After fulfilling his purpose, he left this mortal body at the tender age of thirty three years

 On this basis, he has been called the elusive Buddha
