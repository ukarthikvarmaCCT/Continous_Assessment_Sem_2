 His ancestors were also eminent pundits and litterateurs
 kavyamimasaa unki prasiddh rachana he
 In all Sanskrit literature, Kuntaka and Rajasekhar are two such masters who are not as important in the psyche of traditional Sanskrit pandits as are Raswadi or Alankarist or Soundist
 rajasekhar li se hat kar apni baat kehete hai or kuntak vipareet dhara main bahane kaa saahas rakhane vaale acharya hai
 Rajasekhar was a resident of Maharashtra and was born in the Yayavar dynasty but his life was spent in Bengal

 Rajasekhar composed the following texts: ritivishyak 'ritinirnay' naamak ek granth kaa inke naam se or ullekh miltaa he, kintu vah aprapya he
 Rajashekhar's poetry poetry is not a work written on a single subject, but is an important and useful compilation of poetic and poet's overall usable subjects by his innovative genius style
 is granth kaa pratham adhikaran hi uplabdh he jisamen 18 adhyay hai
 Its name is 'kavi Mysteries' which virtually reveals the mystery of the poet
 isamen kaviyon kaa shreneenirdhaaran; kaviyon ke baithne kaa kram, veshbhusha aadi kar varnan he at: isamen pradhan vishay kavishiksha kaa hi he
 Regarding the tendency, instinct and custom, based on an interesting story, Rajasekhar states that his Priya Sahityaadwadhu used to wear unique costumes, quirky luxuries and new innovative utterances in different regions of the country while exploring the poetry
 is prakaar pravriti arthath veshavinyasakram; vritti arthath vilasvinyasakram or reeti arthath vachanavinyasakram ke aadhaar ko lekar bharat ke vibhinn anchalon kii saahitiyik sampada evam kavyagat saundarya kii samiksha ke vivek par rajasekhar ne vibhinn pradeshon ke naam se vibhinn kavyaneleyon kaa tathyamulak namaakaran kiya he
 Rajasekhar has called himself Kaviraj and placed him above the great poet in the ten categories of poets
 rajasekhar ne apane ko valmiki, bhartrumesht or bhawabhooti kii parampara kaa vyakt kiya he
 Even considering the four trends on the basis of state specific, Rajashekhar considered Vaidarbhi, Gaudi and Panchali, these three customs
 kavyamimasaa se yah baat spasht ho jaati he ki rajasekhar ke vichaar main sookshmtapurvak prakrutinirikshan na karnaa kavi kaa mahaan dosha he
 In Kavamimamsa, the beautiful division of the country division seems to have been done with a view to the incarnation of this trend in poetry
 'kavismay' shabd kaa sarvapratham prayog bhi rajasekhar ne hi kiya he or isaki paribhaasha main iskaa sanket bhi kar diya he
 Many of the latter have imitated Kaviraj Rajasekhara, including Kshemendra, Bhojraj, Hemchandra, Vagbhatta, Keshav Mishra, Ajisen, Deveshwar etc

 It is a method of meditation in which an external object is seen with a gaze
 vidhi- tratak ke liye kisi bhagwaan, devi, devtaa, mahapurush ke chitra, murti yaa chinh kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, the view of spherical, circular, point, fire, moon, sun, etc

 jaipur ke nagar niojak or pramukh-vaastuvid ke rup main vidyadhar kaa naam kisi parichay kaa mohataaj nahin
 He had shown his talent on many occasions and Sawai Jai Singh had full faith in his merit and ability, so when the idea of creating a new city was born nearby Amer in 1727, it was better to leave Vidyadhar
 Who else would be the one executing it? In about four years, the basic work of constructing a new city was completed under the guidance of Vidyadhar

 jinhone gurutvkarshan kaa niyam or gati ke siddhant kii khoj kii
 He was a great mathematician, physicist, astrologer and philosopher
 inkaa shodh prapatr "prakritik darshan ke ganitiya siddhanton "" san 1687 main prakashit hua, jisamen saarvatrik gurtvakarshan evam gati ke niyamon kii vyakhya kii gai thi or is prakaar chirsmmat bhautikee kii neenv rakhi
 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today
 ijac newton kaa janm 4 janvari 1643 ko puraani style or nai style kii tithiyaan |OS]]: 25 disambar 1642]linkolanshir ke county main ek hemelet, woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth main woolsthrope menor main hua
 At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted a Grigorian calendar and so the date of his birth was recorded as Christmas Day 25 December 1642
 newton kaa janm unke pita kii mrityu ke teen maah baad hua, ve ek samrudh kisaan the unka naam bhi ijac newton tha
 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart
 jab newton teen varsh ke the, unki maa ne dubaara shaadi kar lee or apane nae pati reverand barnabus smith ke saath rahane chali gai or apane putr ko uski nani margeri askf kii dekhbhaal main chod diya
chota ijac apane sautele pita ko pasand nahin karata tha or uske saath shaadi karne ke kaaran apni maa ke saath dushmani kaa bhav rakhata tha
 As reflected in the list of crimes committed by him until he was 19 years old: "I threatened to burn the house of mother and father Smith
" baarah varsh se satraa varsh kii aayu tak unhone di kings skool, grantham main shiksha praapt kii unhen skool se nikaal diya gaya or oktober 1659 ve woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth aa gaye, jahaan unki maan, jo duusari baar vidhwaa ho chuki thi, ne unhen kisaan banane par jor diya
 He hated farming
 kings skool ke master henry stokes ne unki maa se kaha ki ve unhen phir se skool bhej den taaki ve apni shiksha ko puraa kar saken
 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus
 agast 1665 main jaise hi newton ne apni degree praapt kii, uske thik baad plig kii bheeshan mahamari se bachane ke liye ehtiyaat ke rup main vishvavidhyalay ko band kar diya
yadhyapi ve ek cambridge vidhyaarthee ke rup main pratishthit nahin the, iske baad ke do varshon tak unhone woolsthorpe main apane ghar par nijee adhyayan kiya or kalan, prakaashiki or gurutvkarshan ke niyamon par apane siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of Trinity
 adhikansh aadhunik itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki newton or libanij ne atyalp kalan kaa vikaas apane apane adwitiya sanketanon kaa upyog karte hue swatantra rup se kiya
 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire
 jabaki libanij kii pustikaayen praarambhik avasthaaon se paripakvata tak vichaaron ke aadhunikeekaran ko darshaati hai, newton ke gyaat nots main keval antim parinaam hi he
 Newton said that he did not want to publish his calculus because he was afraid he would become a character of ridicule
 newton kaa swiss ganitagya nicholas fatiyo de duiliar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta tha, jo prarambh se hi newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant se bahut prabhavit the
 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711
 newton kii royal socity ne ek adhyayan dwaara ghoshnaa kii ki newton hi sachche avishkaarak the or libanij ne dhokhadhadi kii thi
 The study came under suspicion when it was later found that Newton himself wrote commentary on the study's conclusion on Leibniz
 is prakaar kadava newton banaam libanij vivaad shuru ho gaya, jo baad main newton or libanij donon ke jivan main 1716 main libanij kii mrityu tak jari rahaa
 Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, which is valid for any power
 unhone newton kii sarvasamikaon, newton kii vidhi, vargeekrut ghan samtal vakr kii khoj kii, parimit antaron ke siddhant main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, ve pehle vyakti the jinhone bhinnaatmak suchakank kaa prayog kiya or diophentin samikarnon ke hal ko vyutpann karne ke liye nirdeshaank jyamiti kaa upyog kiya
 He approximated the partial sum of the harmonic series by logarithms, and was the first to use the power series with confidence and the power of the power series
 unhen 1669 main ganit kaa leukesian professor chunaa gaya
 In those days, any member of Cambridge or Oxford was required to be a designated English priest
 haalaanki, leukesian professor ke liye jaruri tha ki vah carch main sakriy na ho
 Newton argued that he should be exempt from the need for coordination, and Charles II, whose permission was mandatory, accepted this argument
 is prakaar se newton ke dharmik vichaaron or angreji rudhiwaadiyon ke bich sangharsh tal gaya
 From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics
 During this period he discovered refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism dissects white light into a spectrum of colors, and a lens and a second prism combine white spectrum to form white light
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki rangeen prakaash ko alag karne or bhinn vastuon par chamakaane se ragin prakaash ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin aata he
 Newton described that whether it is reflected, or radiated or transmitted, it remains of the same color
 is prakaar se, unhone dekha ki, rang pehle se rangeen prakaash ke saath vastu kii antarkriya kaa parinaam hota he naaki vasteen khud rangon ko utpann karti hai
 This is known as Newton's color theory
 is kaary se unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki, kisi bhi apvarti doordarshee kaa lens prakaash ke rangon main visaran kaa anubhav karegaa or is avadharana ko siddh karne ke liye unhone abhidrishyak ke rup main ek darpan kaa upyog karte hue, ek doordarshee kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki is samasya ko hal kiya ja sake
 darasal dizin ke nirmaan ke anusaar, pehla gyaat kriyaatmak paravarti doordarshee, aaj ek neutonian doorabeen ke rup main janaa jaataa he, isamen takanic ko aakaar dena tathaa ek upyukt darpan padaarth kii samasya ko hal karnaa shaamil he
 Newton based his mirror on a custom outfit of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to test the quality of optics for his telescope
 farvari 1669 tak ve rangeen vipathan ke bina ek upkaran kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 In 1671 the Royal Society asked him to demonstrate his reflecting telescope
 un logon kii ruchi ne unhen apni tippaniyon on color ke prakaashan hetu protsaahit kiya, jise baad main unhone apni optics ke rup main vistrut kar diya
 When Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he dropped out of public debate
 hook kii mrityu tak donon dushman bane rahe
 Newton argued that light is made up of particles or superfluous particles, which refract as they pass through the dense medium, but it was necessary to correlate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light
 
 baad main bhautikavidon ne prakaash ke vivartan ke liye shuddh tarang jaise spashtikaran kaa samarthan kiya
 Today's quantum mechanics, the idea of photons and wave-particle coupling, bear little resemblance to Newton's understanding of light
 1675 kii unki prakaash kii pariklpana main newton ne kanon ke bich bal ke sthaanantaran hetu, ether kii upasthiti ko manjuur kiya
 His interest in alchemy revived after coming into contact with the theologian Henry More
 unhone ether ko kanon ke bich aakarshan or pratikarshan ke vayuruddh vichaaron par aadhaarit gupt balon se pratisthapit kar diya
 jon menard kenez, jinhone rasayan vidya par newton ke kai lekhon ko sweekaar kiya, kehete hai ki "newton kaaran ke yug ke pehle vyakti nahin the: ve jaaduugaron main aakhri number par the
 "newton's interest in alchemy cannot be distinguished from his contributions to science
 yadi unhone ek nirvaat main se hokar ek duuri par kriya ke gupt vichaar par bharosa nahin kiya hota to ve gurutv kaa apana siddhant viksit nahin kar pate
 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe
 1677 main, newton ne phir se yantriki par apana kaary shuru kiya, arthath, gurutvkarshan or grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon ke sandarbh ke saath, grahon kii kaksha par gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav or is vishay par hook or flemustid kaa paraamarsh
 He published his results at the De Motu Corporum in Jiram
 isamen gati ke niyamon kii shuruyaat thi jisane princepia ko suchit kiya
 The Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published on 5 July 1687 with the financial help and encouragement of Edmund Healy
 is kaary main newton ne gati ke teen saarvbhaumik niyam die jinamein 200 se bhi adhik varshon tak koi sudhaar nahin kiya gaya he
 He used the Latin word gravitas to that effect known as gravitation and defined the law of universal gravitation
 isi kaary main unhone vaayu main dhwani kii gati ke, boil ke niyam par aadhaarit pehle vishleshatmak pramaan ko prastut kiya
 He was criticized for Newton's concept of an invisible force that could operate over vast distances, as he merged "secret agencies" into science
 princepia ke saath, newton ko antarrashtriya khyaati mili
 unhen kaaphi prashansaaen milin, unke ek prashansak the, switzraland main janme nicholas fatiyo de dayulir, jinke saath unka ek gaharaa rishta ban gaya, jo 1693 main tab samaapt hua jab newton tantrika avrodh se peedit ho gaye
 In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious researches related to literary interpretation of the Bible
 henry mor ke brahmad main vishwaas or kartiya dwaitvaad ke liye asweekruti ne shaayad newton ke dharmik vichaaron ko prabhavit kiya
 He sent a manuscript to John Locke in which he disputed the existence of the Trinity, which was never published
 baad ke kaary – di kronology of encyent kingdems amended or obsarvations apon di prophysij of danniel and di apocalips of saint jon – kaa prakaashan unki mrityu ke baad hua
 He also devoted much of his time to alchemy
 newton 1689 se 1690 tak or 1701 main england kii sansad ke sadsy bhi rahe
 lekin kuch vivaranon ke anusaar unki tippaniyan hameshaa koshth main ek thande sookhe ko lekar hi hoti thim or ve khidki ko band karne kaa anurodh karte the
 In 1696 Newton moved to London to assume the post of warden of the royal mint, a position he gained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, the first Earl of Halifax, the then Chancellor of the Treasury
 unhone england kaa pramukh mudra dhallaai kaa kaary sambhaal liya, kisi tarah master lucas ke ishaaron par naachne lage Lucan's death in 1699 became Newton perhaps the best-known master of the mint, a position Newton held until his death
 These appointments were taken as an irresponsible position, but Newton took him seriously, from his Cambridge duties in 1701 Retired and tried to improve the currency and punished the clippings and fake currency makers using their power
 1717 main taksaal ke master ke rup main "laa of queen ene" main newton ne anjaane main sone ke paksh main chaandi ke paise or sone ke sikke ke bich dwi dhatvik sambandh sthapit karte hue, pound sterling ko chaandi ke maanak se sone ke maanak main badal diya
 For this reason silver sterling coins were melted and shipped out of Britain
 newton ko 1703 main royal socity kaa adhyaksh or french acadmic des sciensej kaa ek sahyogi bana diya gaya
 While in his position in the Royal Society, Newton turned hostile to the astronomer John Flemsteed, he prematurely published Flemsteed's Historica Colestis Britannica, which Newton had used in his studies
 april 1705 main queen eni ne newton ko trinity college, cambridge main ek shahi yatra ke dauraan nite kii oopaadhi di
 This knight's title was not conferred upon Newton for his services as master of the mint nor for his scientific work, but for his political contributions during the parliamentary election in May 1705
 
 newton kii mrityu landan main 31 march 1727 ko hui, or unhen westminster ebbe main dafnaaya gaya tha
 His half-niece, Catherine Barton Conduite, served as her hostess in social affairs at her house in Germain Street in London; He was her "very loving Uncle", which is mentioned in her letter written to her by Newton when she was recovering from smallpox
 newton, jinke koi bachche nahin the, unke antim varshon main unke rishtdaaron ne unki adhikansh sampatti par adhikaar kar liya or nirvasiyat hi unki mrityu ho gai
 After his death, a large amount of mercury was found in Newton's body, probably a result of his chemical business
 paare kii vishaaktata newton ke antim jivan main sanakeepan ko spasht kar sakati he
 French mathematician Joseph Lewis lagrange often said that Newton was the greatest genius and once said that he was "the most fortunate also because we cannot establish the world's system more than once
" Impressed by Newton's achievements, the English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous memoir: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 newton apni uplabdhiyon kaa bataane main khud sankoch karte the, farvari 1676 main unhone robert hook ko ek patr main likhaa: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants haalanki aamtaur par itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki uparokt panktiyaan, namrata ke saath kahe gaye ek kathan ke alaava – yaa bajaay –, hook par ek hamalaa thim 
 us samay prakaashikeey khojon ko lekar donon ke bich ek vivaad chal rahaa tha
 The latter interpretation is also appropriate with many other controversies over his discoveries, such as the question of who discovered the calculus, as noted above
 baad main ek itihaas main, newton ne likhaa: i do not know how i will appear to the world, but for myself i am a boy who is playing on the edge of the sea and concentrating now and then, a more smooth stone or a more beautiful Trying to find the shell, this great sea of truth has not been discovered before me

 "snowbelen concluded that Newton had at least one Socinian sympathizer, possibly an anti-trinity, almost certainly the Arrian
 —teen purvji rup jo aaj uniterianvaad kehalaate hai
 In an era noted for his religious intolerance, there are few public expressions of Newton's radical views, most notably, his refusal to obey holy orders, and to take the sacrament when he was about to die
 And he refused

 In his own lifetime, Newton wrote about religion more than natural science
 He believed in the rational world, but rejected the hylozoism inherent in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza
 Thus, ordered and dynamically informed cosmologies Was understandable and should be understood by an active cause
 In his correspondence, Newton claimed that Prine Time "writes Sipia i had an eye upon such principles, in order to be considered faith in God and man
" He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: such wonderful uniformity in the planetary system should be allowed the effect of choice
 " But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be necessary to improve the system due to the slow growth of instabilities

 The attacks against pre-enlightenment "magical thinking," and the mystical elements of Christianity, found their foundation in Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe
 Newton perfected Boyle's ideas through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, he was very successful in popularizing them
 Newton transformed an interventionist God-controlled world into a world artistically created by God with rational and universal principles

 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different

 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move

 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted

 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity

 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation

 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth

 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked

 Referring to the diagram at the right, the six trigonometric functions of θ are: The following identities are trivial algebraic consequences of these definitions and the division identity
they rely on multiplying or dividing the numerator and denominator of fractions by a variable
 Ie, Or Two angles whose sum is π / 2 radians are complementary
 In the diagram, the angles at vertices a and b are complementary, so we can exchange a and b, and change θ to π / 2 − θ, obtaining: Identity 1: Proof 1: Refer to the triangle diagram above
 Note that a 2 + b 2 = h 2 { \ displaystyle a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} = h ^ {2}} by Pythagorean theorem
 The following two results follow from this and the ratio identities
 To obtain the first, divide both sides of sin 2 ⁡ + cos 2 ⁡ = 1 { \ displaystyle \ sin ^{2}+ \ cos ^{2}=1} by cos 2 ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ cos ^{2}} ; for the second, divide by sin 2 ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ sin ^{2}} 
 Alike Proof 2: Differentiating the left-hand side of the identity yields: Integrating this shows that the original identity is equal to a constant, and this constant can be found by plugging in any arbitrary value of x
 Identity 2: The following accounts for all three reciprocal functions
 Proof 1: Refer to the triangle diagram above
 Note that a 2 + b 2 = h 2 { \ displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=h^{2}} by Pythagorean theorem
 Substituting with appropriate functions - Rearranging gives: Draw a horizontal line; mark an origin O
 Draw a line from o at an angle α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} above the horizontal line and a second line at an angle β { \ displaystyle \ beta} above that; the angle between the second line and the x-axis is α + β { \ displaystyle \ alpha + \ beta}
 Place p on the line defined by α + β { \ displaystyle \ alpha + \ beta } at a unit distance from the origin
 Let PQ be a line perpendicular to line defined by angle α { \ displaystyle \ alpha}, drawn from point q on this line to point P
 ∴ { \ displaystyle \ therefore} OQP is a right angle
 Let QA be a perpendicular from point a on the x-axis to q and PB be a perpendicular from point b on the x-axis to P
 ∴ { \ displaystyle \ therefore } OAQ and OBP are right angles
 Draw QR parallel to the x-axis
 Now angle r p q = α { \ displaystyle RPQ= \ alpha } By substituting - β { \ displaystyle - \ beta} for β { \ displaystyle \ beta} and using Symmetry, we also get: Another simple "proof" can be given using Euler's formula known from complex analysis:euler's formula is: Although it is more precise to say that Euler's formula entails the trigonometric identities, it follows that for angles α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} and β { \ displaystyle \ beta} we have: Also using the following properties of exponential functions: Evaluating the product: Equating real and imaginary parts: Using the figure above, By substituting − β { \ displaystyle - \ beta } for β { \ displaystyle \ beta } and using Symmetry, we also get: Also, using the complementary angle formulae, From the sine and cosine formulae, we get Dividing both numerator and denominator by cos ⁡ α cos ⁡ β { \ displaystyle \ cos \ alpha \ cos \ beta}, we get Subtracting β { \ displaystyle \ beta } from α { \ displaystyle \ alpha }, using tan ⁡ = − tan ⁡ β { \ displaystyle \ tan=- \ tan \ beta } , Alike from the sine and cosine formulae, we get Then by dividing both numerator and denominator by sin ⁡ α sin ⁡ β { \ displaystyle \ sin \ alpha \ sin \ beta }, we get Or, using cot ⁡ θ = 1 tan ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle \ cot \ theta = { \ frac {1} { \ tan \ theta}}}, Using cot ⁡ = − cot ⁡ β { \ displaystyle \ cot=- \ cot \ beta } , From the angle sum identities, we get and The Pythagorean identities give the two alternative forms for the latter of these: The angle sum identities also give It can also be proved using Euler's formula Squaring both sides yields But replacing the angle with its doubled version, which achieves the same result in the left side of the equation, yields It follows that Expanding the square and simplifying on the left hand side of the equation gives Because the imaginary and real parts have to be the same, we are left with the original identities and also The two identities giving the alternative forms for cos 2θ lead to the following equations: The sign of the square root needs to be chosen properly — note that if π is added to θ, the quantities inside the square roots are unchanged, but the left-hand-sides of the equations change sign
 Therefore the correct sign to use depends on the value of θ
 For the tan function, the equation is: Then multiplying the numerator and denominator inside the square root by and using Pythagorean identities leads to: Also, if the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by, the result is: This also gives: Similar manipulations for the cot function give: If ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi}, θ { \ displaystyle \ theta} and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi} are the angles of a triangle, ie ψ + θ + φ = π = { \ displaystyle \ psi + \ theta + \ phi = \ pi =} half circle, Proof: If ψ + θ + φ = π 2 = { \ displaystyle \ psi + \ theta + \ phi = { \ tfrac { \ pi} {2}} =} quarter circle, Proof: Replace each of ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi}, θ { \ displaystyle \ theta}, and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi} with their complementary angles, so cotangents turn into tangents and vice-versa
 Given so the result follows from the triple tangent identity
 First, start with the sum-angle identities: By adding these together, Similarly, by subtracting the two sum-angle identities, Let α + β = θ { \ displaystyle \ alpha + \ beta = \ theta} and α - β = φ { \ displaystyle \ alpha - \ beta = \ phi}, Substitute θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi } Therefore, Similarly for cosine, start with the sum-angle identities: Again, by adding and substracting Substitute θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi } as before, The figure at the right shows a sector of a circle with radius 1
 The sector is θ / of the whole circle, so its area is θ / 2
 The area of triangle OAD is AB / 2, or sinθ / 2
 The area of triangle OCD is CD / 2, or tanθ / 2
 Since triangle OAD lies completely inside the sector, which in turn lies completely inside triangle OCD, we have This geometric argument applies if 0π / 2, then θ>1
 But sinθ≤1, so sinθ<θ
 So we have For negative values of θ we have, by symmetry of the sine function Hence Proof: From the previous inequalities, we have, for small angles Therefore, Consider the right-hand inequality
 Since Multply through by cos ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle \ cos \ theta } Combining with the left-hand inequality: Taking cos ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle \ cos \ theta } to the limit as θ → 0 { \ displaystyle \ theta \ to 0} Therefore, Proof: The limits of those three quantities are 1, 0, and 1 / 2, so the resultant limit is zero
 Proof: As in the preceding proof, The limits of those three quantities are 1, 1, and 1 / 2, so the resultant limit is 1 / 2

 praaia: yah teen ore se khuli hoti he or chat stambhon par, yaa kabhi kabhi bina stambhon ke hi mukhya bhawan se nikali hui bahudhranon par alambit rahati he
 In many ancient temples such as the Durgamandir of Aihole, the Mahadevamandir of Khajuraho, Osia, the 9-10th century in the Suryamandir of Marwar) or Modhera, Bharadra's 'dwaramandap' form is special in Suryamandir, Gujarat
 khujraho ke mandiron main ise 'ardhamandap' naam diya jaataa he
 Apart from the main temple, it is also known as 'diyodhi', due to it being a semi-temple
 kahin-kahin yah teen ore se khulaa na hokar keval saamne kii ore hi khulaa rahata he, jaise kanchipuram ke vaikuth perupal mandir main yaa bhubaneshwar ke vaital deble mandir main
 Over the years, any type of balcony in front of the gateway and the pillars made for decoration also came to be called Bhadra

 In the United States, any roofed structure with openings on three sides, which is found in any building, is called a 'porch'
 is prakaar isamen or kisi baraamde yaa shayanpraangan main praaia: kuch antar hi nahin rah jaataa
 The original form of Bhadra can also be inferred from ancient structures

 'bajirao mastaani' ek bhartiya aitihaasik romance film he jiskaa nirdesan or nirmaan sanjay lila bhansaali ne kiya he
 The film tells about Peshwa Bajirao of the Maratha Empire and his second wife Mastani
 ranvir singh or deepika padukon ne ye donon mukhya kirdaar nibhaae hai, priyanka chopra ne bajirao kii pehali patni kaa va tanvi aazmi ne bajirao kii maan kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 Bajirao Mastani is released on 18 December 2015
 bajirao mastaani film kii shuruyaat nae peshwa banane se shuru hoti he iske liye bajirao ko chunaa jaataa he iske baad is khushi main sabhi samrajya ke log khushi manaate hai
 Then suddenly Mastani from Bundelkhand comes to the aid and after fighting Bajirao's soldiers directly meets Bajirao and convinces him to take him to Bundelkhand where he fights with both the rivals and conquers there
 iske baad bajirao bundelkhand main holi manaate he isi bich bajirao or mastaani main pyaar ho jaataa he
 On the second day, Bajirao goes back to Pune
 isi bich jate vaqt bajirao mastaani ko apni kataar de ke jate hai is kaaran bundelkhand main kataar se vivaah ho jaataa he is parampara ke tahat mastaani pune jaati he
 There she meets Radhabai, Bajirao's mother
 radhabai mastaani ko nahin chaahati he is kaaran wo nafrat karne lagati he
 After this, Chimaji Appa shows Shaniwarwada and also shows amazing Ainamahal
 mastaani jab radhabai se rishte ko maanane liye kahati he to wo ghunghru dekar kahati he ki ab se tumhaara rishta ho gaya he ab se tum mehafil main naachogi
 Then Chhatrapati Sahu is invited from Satara, then Bajirao goes there, then Radhabai goes a new trick and sends Mastani by giving it to Gungroo but Mastani reaches there and puts Ghungroo in front of Gungru Chhatrapati Sahu, due to this, the Pant representative considered insult to the Mahfil
 But when Chhatrapati Sahu comes to know that she is the daughter of King Chhatrasal, he bites her to go back and says that you Or should he Mastani speaks that i should Baji is in love with Baji
 iske pashchaat mastaani bajirao kii pratiksha karti he us vaqt tufaan aa jaataa he or bajirao vahaan aakar mastaani se vivaah kar detaa he
 Meanwhile, Kashibai also comes to know and she also gets angry
 phir kashibai or mastaani ke putr hote he or unka namakaran kiya jaataa he
 Kashibai's son is named Raghunath while Mastani's son is named Samasher Bahadur
 isi bich bajirao or chimaji appa ke bich ladaai ho jaati he
 Bajirao tells everyone that he will bring Mastani to Shaniwarwada on Saptami day, but Krishnabhata and Radhabai tell them not to do it
 yah film suprasiddh marathi upanyaaskaar nagnath inaamdaar ke utkrisht aitihaasik upanyaas rau par aadhaarit he
 This novel is one of the successful historical novels not only in Marathi but also in the entire Indian languages
 isamen itihaas evam itihaas-ras donon kii raksha karte hue utkrisht sarjanaatmakataa kaa parichay diya gaya he
 There is naturally a lot of drama in this novel and while reading, it seems as if someone is watching a good serial
 iske varnanaatmak drishy bhi chalchitr ke drishyon kii tarah maanas-patal par ankit rah jate hai
 Being based on such a novel, a number of features have naturally come into the film
 sanjay lila bhansaali jaise siddhhast nirdeshak ke dwaara yah kahani or bhi chamak uthi he
 It is natural for the film to make some difference from the text, as the mediums of the two are different, but in this film some differences have been deliberately introduced in the form of film shots and shakes, which has shocked the perception of history
 aarambhik drishyon main bajirao ko peshwa niyukt karne vaala drishy to bahut hi uttam evam upyukt bhi he, or upanyaas se baahar kaa hote hue bhi aitihaasikta evam itihaas-bodh ke sarvatha anuroop he; parantu jis drishy main kashibai kii puraani saheli aati he, jiskaa pati peshwa bajirao ke kaaran maaraa gaya he or isliye vah apane pati kii raakh vahaan chhod kar ek tarah se shaap detii he, vahaan spasht antar aa gaya he
 In the novel, Kashibai has a dignified presence as a skilled housewife, while in the film, Kashibai is seen leaping towards a playful teenager, unraveling history
 filmkaar yah bhi bhul gaya he ki jis kashibai kaa vah aisa filmakan kar rahaa he uskaa betaa jawan ho rahaa he or vahi us utsav kaa mukhya karta-dharta tha
 Here, instead of Kashibai Peshwa's wife, the film heroine seems to be 'priyanka Chopra'
 chhatrasaal kii sahaayta ke liye bajirao ko mastaani ke dwaara sena sahit le janaa bhi bilkul anaitihaasik rup vaala ho gaya he
 Very interesting to see, but neither did it, nor could it happen by Mastani
 is prakaar ke chote-mote drishyon ko chhod bhi den tab bhi do akshamya bhoolen filmkaar ne kii hai-- shrimant bajirao peshwa or kashibai donon ko alag alag samay main nachvaa daalaa he
 In that era and in the Peshwa family, a woman like Kashibai, who was in a way a queen, would not have needed to keep dancers exclusively if she danced
 usamen bhi khaas baat yah he ki jis samay film main kashibai ko mastaani ke saath nachaaya gaya he, un dinon uske pair main baraabar rahane vaala dard or bhi badha hua tha
 Kashibai's meeting with Mastani has also turned out to be a different way and the film is shaky
 atah aitihaasikta ke saath rachanaatmak anand ke liye to ukt upanyaas hi padhanaa hoga, parantu mahan bajirao peshwa evam mastaani kii apurv premgautha evam durdharsh jivan ko maharashtra se baahar bhi jan-jan tak pahunchaane kaa kaary is film ne prabal rup se kiya he, iske liye filmkaar avashya dhanyavad ke paatr hai
 The acting of almost all the actors is also lively and admirable, which motivates the film to watch again and again
 varsh 2003 main sanjay lila bhansaali ne is film ke mukhya kirdaar ke liye salmaan khan or aishwarya raay ko chunaa tha
 Who was also in the lead role in his film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam
