 She is also known by the name "morvi", being the daughter of Daityaraja Moore
 

 According to a legend in the Kaumarika section of Skanda Purana composed by Sage Ved Vyas, when Sri Krishna killed Daityaraja Moore, at the same time, Morvi challenged Sri Krishna to battle in the battlefield to avenge his father's slaughter 


 and ask him Started war, and began to fail every weapon of Shri Krishna 


 Finally, Shri Krishna took the Sudarshan Chakra to kill Morvi, doing this to Shri Krishna
 Shree, Goddess Kamakhya appeared and asked Shri Krishna not to kill Morvi and told Morvi - "O Morvi, this is your future brother, so by apologizing to him, get his blessings 


" Then Morvi did so Did it 

 Subsequently, Morvi was married to Ghatotkacha after winning the competition of debate planned by Morvi of Ghatotkach, son of Mahabali bhimsen-hidimba as per Shri Krishna's orders
 

 kuch samay pashchaat ghatotkach or morvi ko ek putr ratna kii prapti hui, jiskaa naam barbaric rakhaa gaya

 Watches are made with many principles
 jaise dhoop ghadi, yantric ghadi, electronic ghadi aadi Most clocks have a spontaneous system of regularly producing repetitive actions, such as oscillator oscillation, oscillation of spiral cords and equilibrium cycles, oscillation of pressure channels, or comparison of high frequency signals to the atomic structure of atoms
 pracheen kaal main dhoop ke kaaran padanevaali kisi vriksh athwa anya sthir vastu kii chaaya ke dwaara samay ke anumaan kiya jaataa tha
 Such incense has been practiced since ancient times in which "clock" or "stroke" was estimated by the change in the speed of reflection of a stone or a stable piece of iron due to the sun's movement in the sky

 In 1300, Henry de Vick created the first clock with a wheel, numeral and hour director needle, in which the needles and oscillators of minutes and seconds were attached by 1700 AD
 aajkal kii yantric ghadiyaan isi shrunkhlaa kii sanshodhit, sanvardhit evam viksit kadiyaan hai
 The repetitive action of the mechanical clock depends on the oscillation of a oscillator, or the balance wheel and the balancing spring, or balancing

 Many serrated wheels are associated with them
 dolan pranali kaa ek dolan puraa hone par in pahiyon ke ek yaa ek se adhik daante dhoomate hai
 Thus these wheels calculate oscillations
 in pahiyon se ghadi kii suiyaan judi hoti hai, jo dial par gumti hai or dial par ankit samayvibhag kii sahaayta se samay batalaati hai
 The number page is divided into hours, minutes and seconds
 dolak evam ganakyantr pranaaliyon ko nirantar chalaate rahane ke liye vaanchit urja kamaani yaa bhaar dwaara praapt hoti he
 In general, the oscillator system receives energy from the calculator system through a special mechanical system, which is called the drainage system
 yah dhaatu kaa ek gol tukdaa hota he, jo dhaatu kii ek chad dwaara latakaaya hua rahata he
 When the oscillator's expansion or amplitude is not very high, the oscillator's oscillation time is usually the same
 yah dekha gaya he ki 39
14 inch lambaaiwale dolak kii chad main 0
001 inch kaa parivartan kar dene par ghadi ke samay main 1 second prati din kaa antar pad jaataa he
 Similarly, if the oscillation expansion is increased by more than 3 inches, then there is a difference of 1 second in clock time by every 0
1 inch increase
 isse spasht he ki taap main parivartan se dolak kii lambaai main honevaale parivartanon ke kaaran ghadi ke samay main aksar truti aa jaati he
 To overcome this defect, the rod is made of steel-alloy or "invar", which changes only one-tenth of that of ordinary steel due to the effect of cold heat
 harrison kaa gridispaat dolak es hi dolak k vyaavhaarik rup he
 It is a system in which momentary oscillating impulses are provided to the oscillator by a rotating wheel or wheel and, at the same time, the speed of that cycle remains constant throughout the period of oscillation of the oscillator
 is prakaar yah vyavastha dolan kii gananaa karne, dolan ko niyamit rakhane tathaa dolan aayam ko niyantrit karne kaa kaary karti he
 The best escape mechanism is one in which a small load falls on the oscillator at regular intervals, giving it a uniform impulse the moment the oscillator is passing through its mean state
 yah vyavastha kai prakaar se sampann kii ja sakati he, jinamein nimnlikhit mukhya he : It has an anchor a which oscillates around the center A
 k se ek dolak neeche kii ore lataka hota he
 After the oscillation of the oscillator, a tooth in the wheel crosses one of the pallets on both ends of the anchor
 is prakaar vah us pallate ko ek halakaa sa dhakka detaa he jisase vah pallate upar uth jaataa he or doosraa pallate apane neeche vaale pahie par girakar use peeche kii ore halkaa sa jhatka detaa he
 But the curvature of this palette is such that in response to this shock, the tooth picks up this palette and crosses below it
 is prakaar yah pahiyaa nirantar chalata rahata he or lungar kaa dolan karaata rahata he
 In this circulatory cycle, the tip of the teeth are placed in the opposite direction of the tip of the teeth of the aforesaid rebound exodus

 The chronometer, or chronometer, employed in modern watches is such a separate escape cycle
 vastut: isi par ghadi kii parishuddhta or yatharthata nirbhar karti he
 There are many wheels in the watch, which are driven by the energy provided by a falling load or segmental
 patansheel bhaar dwaara chalanevaali ghadiyaan aaj se saikadon varsh purv banaai gai thim
 These consisted of a weight hanging from the ends of a long thread wrapped around a large drum, which itself moved down and rolled the drum
 dhol ek chote pahie se judaa rahata tha
 This wheel spun itself and spun a large wheel with the help of its teeth
 bade pahie ke saath ek chota pahiyaa ghumta tha, jo ek anya bade pahie ko ghumata tha
 This larger wheel was related to a drainage mechanism, which controlled the speed of the fall of the load
 palaayan chakra ko ek dolak kii sahaayta se niyamit gati se ghumaya jaataa tha
 One tooth of the migration cycle moved with oscillation from right to left of oscillator
 in pahiyon main se ek ke saath ghante kii, duusare ke saath minute kii or tisare ke saath second kii sooyee judi rahati thi
 These needles used to rotate on a number page
 chote pahie ke chha: dante the or yah minute k sooyee se sambandhit tha
 There were 72 teeth in the big wheel
 isse ghante kii sooyee sambanddh thi
 Thus, when the small wheel completed 12 rounds, the big wheel rotated one round

 The spring is tightened
 pahiyon ke ghoomane ke liye aavashyak urja is kamaani ke dhire dhire khulne kii kriya se praapt hoti he
 Small watches have a balancing wheel in place of the oscillator, which rotates from right to left
 is ghurnan ko niyantrit karne ke liye ek keshakamani lagi hoti he
 When the balance wheel rotates in one direction, there is a spasm in the capillary, which brings it back to the opposite direction and causes rotation
 ghadi ko nirantar gatisheel rakhane ke liye faaulad kii kamaani ko niyat avadhi ke baad pun: kasakar lapet diya jaataa he, jiske liye ek chaabi hoti he
 Clock clocks and whip clocks, or timepieces, that produce bells ringing at certain times, have a separate system for generating bells

 Maharani Ahilyabai was the wife of Khanderao, son of history-famous Subedar Malharrao Holkar
 janm inkaa san 1725 main hua tha or dehanth 13 agast 1795 ko; tithi us din bhadrapada krishna chaturdashi thi
 Ahilyabai was not the queen of a very heavy kingdom
 unka kaaryakshetra apekshaakrit simit tha
 Yet what he did, surprises him
 das-baarah varsh kii aayu main unka vivaah hua
 She was widowed at the age of twenty nine
 pati kaa swabhaav chanchal or ugr tha
 They tolerated all this
 phir jab bayalis-taintalis varsh kii thim, putr malerao kaa dehanth ho gaya
 When Ahilyabai was about sixty-two years old, Dauhitra Nathu passed away
 chaar varsh peeche damaad yashwantrao phanse na rahaa or inaki putree muktabai sati ho gai
 He had affection for Malharrao, the son of a distant relative Tukojirao; She used to think that in future it will handle the doors of governance, system, justice and prajaranjan; But he kept grieving them till the end
 ahilyabai ne apane rajya kii simaaon ke baahar bharat-bhar ke prasiddh tirthon or sthanon main mandir banawaye, ghat bandhwaae, kuon or baavadiyon kaa nirmaan kiya, maarg banawaye-sudharwaaye, bhukhon ke liye annsatr khole, pyaason ke liye pyau bithlaayin, mandiron main vidwaanon kii niyukti shastron ke manan-chintan or pravachan hetu kii
 And, by sacrificing the false temptation of self-respect, always tried to do justice - till death
 ye usee parampara main thim jisamen unke samakaleen puna ke nyaayadhish ramshastri the or unke peeche jhansi kii rani lakshmibai hui
 It was during her lifetime that the public began to understand and say 'devi'
 itnaa bada vyaktitv janata ne apni aankhon dekha hi kahan tha
 When there was a mess around
 shashan or vyavastha ke naam par ghor atyaachaar ho rahe the
 People - ordinary householders, peasants, laborers - were sobbing in a very inferior state
 unka ekmaatr sahaara-dharm-andhvishwaason, bhay traason or rudhiyon kii jakad main ksaa ja rahaa tha
 There was neither power nor faith in justice
 aise kaal kii un vikat paristhitiyon main ahilyabai ne jo kuch kiya-or bahut kiya
 - She is memorable
 indore main prati varsh bhadrapada krishna chaturdashi ke din ahilyotsav hota chalaa aata he
 There is a difference of opinion regarding the importance of their temple building and other religious functions
 in kaaryon main ahilyabai ne andhadhundh kharch kiya or sena nae dhang par sangathit nahin kii
 Tukoji Holkar's army had to bear the brunt of the Northern Expeditions, sometimes it is alleged that these temples have been told the outposts of Hinduism
 tukojirao holkar ke paas baarah lakh rupye the jab vah ahilyabai se rupye kii maang par maang kar rahaa tha or sansar ko dikhalaataa tha ki rupye-paise se tang hoon
 Then what was the fault of Ahilyabai? The spirit of religion has been the biggest driving force for Hindus; Ahilyabai used the same
 tatkaaleen andhvishwaason or rudhiyon kaa varnan upanyaas main aayaa he
 One of these beliefs was to jump from a hill in the Narmada arrow near Mandhata and commit suicide to attain salvation
 ahilyabai ke sambandh main do prakaar kii vichaardhaaraen rahi hai
 In one, she has been given the title of incarnation of Goddess, in the second she has shown reverence for superstitions and stereotypes along with her superlative qualities
 vah andhere main prakaash-kiran ke samaan thim, jise andheraa baar-baar grasane kii cheshtaa karata rahaa
 Due to her excellent ideas and ethical conduct, she got the status of Goddess in the society
 malharav ke bhai-bandon main tukojirao holkar ek vishwaasapaatr yuvak the
 Malharrao had also kept him with him forever and got ready for the reign
 ahilyabai ne inhen apana senapati banaaya or chouth vasuul karne kaa kaam unhen saunp diya
 Though Tukojirao Holkar was older than Ahilyabai at the age, but Tukoji considered her as his mother and used to do the work of the state with full devotion and truth
 ahilyabai kaa un par itnaa prem or vishwaas tha ki vah bhi unhen putr jaisaa maanati thim
 'khandoji Sut Tukoji Holkar' is said in the state papers wherever they are mentioned and also in the seals
 rajya kii chintaa kaa bhaar or us par praanon se bhi pyaare logon kaa viyog
 Ahilyabai's body could not handle all this grief
 or 13 agast san 1795 ko unki jivan-lila samaapt ho gai
 After Ahilyabai's death, Tukoji ascended the throne of Indore

 But by this time the anglo-saxon people had become Christians

 Therefore, valor, valor, compassion, service etc
 were also attributed to the valor and valor described in these languages
 anglo-sackson kavita kaa shuddh dharmavishyak ansh bhi in gaathaon ke rup se prabhavit he There is also an exaggeration of style with valor in these gathas

 Their language was much closer to the local language

 But the entire literature of this era lacks elegance chosar purv madhyadeshiy angreji kaal na keval england main hi balki europe ke anya deshon main bhi france ke saahitiyik netritv kaa kaal he

 ritivaadee yug – yah shatabdi tark or reeti kaa utkarshkaal he
 Leibniz, Dakart, and Newton developed rationalism and mechanical materialism through the method of work-cause
