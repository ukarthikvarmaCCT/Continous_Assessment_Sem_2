 Steel is an alloy
 praayah mishra dhaatuon ke gun us mishradhatu ko banane vaale sanghatakon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai
 Steel is stronger than iron
 kaansa, pital, taanka aadi mishratu hai
 Alloy is a term that is widely used for any metallic substance, unless it is a chemical element
 mishradhatu banane kii kala ati pracheen he
 The truth is that the importance of bronze was so much in one era that the name of that era of development of human civilization has become 'bronze Age'
 yadhyapi shuddh dhaatuon ke kai upyogi gun hai, jaise ooshmaa or vidyut kii suchaalakata, tathaapi yantric or nirmaan sambandhi kaaryon main saadharantaya shuddh dhaatuen upyog main nahin laai jaatin, kyonki inamen aavashyak majbootee nahin hoti
 The most important method of making a metal stronger is metalworking
 is disha main 19veen shatabdi main bahut adhik prayaas hua, usee kaa fal he ki anek upyogi kaaryon ke liye aaj paanch hajaar se bhi adhik mishradhatuen uplabdh hai or nai mishradhatuen taiyaar karne ke liye nity nae nae prayog kiye ja rahe hai
 Today alloys with desired properties are made for any particular use
 dhaatuen jab kisi saamaanya vilyan, jaise amla, main ghulti he tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ko chhod detii hai or saadharantaya lavan banaati hai, kintu pighalaane par jab ve paraspar ghulti hai tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ke sahit rahati hai
 Such solid solutions of metals are called alloys
 anek mishradhaatuon main adhatuen bhi alp maatra main hoti hai, kintu sampurna kaa gun dhatvik rahata he
 Therefore, in 1939, the American Board of Examiners made the following definition of alloy - prarambh main mishradhatu kaa adhiktam upyog sikkon or aabhushanon ke banane main hota tha
 Copper, tin and zinc are 95 / 4 and 1 percent respectively in copper coins

 Platinum, gold and silver are used to add beauty to the colors of jewelery, to make them hard, strong and durable, or to mix them with other metals for sale at cheaper prices
 yah nishchay karnaa ki mishradhatuen saadhaaran mishran hai yaa rasinic yogic, ek jatil samasya he
 In some sense, these are chemical compounds, because when sodium succulents are made, then every piece of sodium in the cross causes a strong flame of light and the mercury becomes hot, a symptom of the compound being formed
 isi prakaar pighalate hue sone main jab aluminium dhaatu kaa ek tukdaa daalate hai, tab itani adhik ooshmaa utpann hoti he ki sampurna pighali hui dhaatu ujjwal prakashmay ho jaati he
 The color of many alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 udaahranarth, chaandi or jasta dona shwet rang ke hote hai, kintu inase jo mishradhatu banati he uskaa rang ati sundar gulabi hota he
 Gold is yellow and aluminum is white, but the color of their alloy is very shiny
 yah gun bhi yogicon kaa he
 On extracting the melting point of alloys, it is known that the behavior of alloys is of two types: The melting point of some alloys changes as the content of the metal changes, it is the property of the mixture and the melting point of some alloys is a constant temperature
 Occurs, indicating that alloys are compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke bhautik tathaa rasinic gun apni avyav dhaatuon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai or mishradhaatuon ke gun kisi bhi prakaar se avyav dhaatuon ke gunon ke madhya nahin hote
 This difference is due to the fact that when metals are melted together, they form many interconnected compounds and solid solutions
 mishradhatu kaa ghanatv apni avyav-dhaatuon ke madhya ghanatv se kam yaa adhik ho saktaa he
 The color of some alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 ye apni avyav dhaatuon se kathortar, kintu kam lacheelee tathaa ghaatvarghy or adhik bhangur hoti hai
 The melting point of alloys is always less than the melting point of the melting element at maximum temperature
 or praaia: nunatam taap par pighalanevaali avyav dhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 For example, an alloy containing lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium is faulted at 75 ° C, while the melting point of tin, the metallic ingredient at the lowest temperature, is 232 ̊c
 ye sab ve gun hai jinke kaaran mishradhatuen shuddh dhaatuon se adhik moolyawaan ho jaati hai tathaa udyog main adhik upyogi siddh hoti hai
 As a result of detailed study of the organization and crystalline composition of alloys by the fruits mentioned above and by microscopes, X-ray spectral measurements, thermal and chemical analysis and other physical tests, alloys are placed in three categories
 yah vibhaajan mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuon ke parmaanuon kaa samooh kis prakaar se sangathit he, uske aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 These three categories are the following: is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuen jab pighali hui hoti hai, tab ve ek duusare main ghuli hui rahati hai, kintu thos hone par dhaatuon ke crystal alag-alag ho jate hai, arthath dhaatuen paraspar aviley hai
 In this way, the alloy is a mixture of pure crystals of each element metal, and on cooling, one element separates the metal into solid form
 udaahranarth, ek taral mishradhatu, jisamen matraanusaar 10 bhaag sisa or 90 bhaag tin hote hai, jab thandi kii jaati he tab shuddh tin ke crystal pratham usee prakaar se pruthak hote hai jis prakaar shuddh him ke crystal chini ke tanu vilyan main se thanda karne par pruthak hote hai
 The temperature at which tin crystals begin to separate is lower than the melting point of pure tin
 tin ke galnaank ko jab usamen sisa ghulaa rahata he, gyaat kar sise kaa anubhaar usee niyam dwaara nikaalte hai jis niyam se pani main ghuli vaston kaa anubhaar nikaalte hai
 By this method, several molecules of those metals have been extracted, which remain as separate atoms in the diluent solution
 sisa-antimony mishradhatu mishran shrenee kii he
 Antimony is brittle and lead soft
 mudran dhaatu sisi, antimony or atyant kam maatra main tin kii mishradhatu he
 This alloy has the hardness of antimony, but it is not as brittle as that
 is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main ek avyav dhaatu ke parmaanu duusari avyav dhaatu ke crystalia dhaanche main bhalee-bhanti baith jate hai
 There are two different types of alloys of solid solution: tanba-nikal kii anek mishradhatuen jinka mahatvapurn upyog he, thos vilyan kii shrenee main aati hai
 For example, alloys from which nickel coins, rifle bullets and a wire have high electrical resistance are made
 canada ke bahut se khanijon main tanba or nikal ke sulphide hote hai, jinako galane se ek mishradhatu milti he
 It contains nickel and copper 67 and 28 percent and the remaining five percent contains iron and manganese respectively
 is mishradhatu ko monelle dhaatu kehete hai
 It is more tensile, flexible and corrosion resistant
 saadhaarant: dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar yogic nahin banaatin, kintu ooshmaa vishleshan dwaara gyaat hua he ki dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar bahut adhik sankhya main yogic banaati hai
 The class name of these compounds is interstitial compound
 is prakaar ke sabase adhik yogic kshar or kshareey mitti kii dhaatuen, aavart sarini ke visham upavirgo kii dhaatuon ke saath sanyog karke, banaati hai
 The amount of metals in these compounds is reflected by chemical formulas
 in sutron ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki is prakaar ke yogic sanyojaktaa ke un sab niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai jo dhaatu tathaa adhatu ke sanyog se bananevaale yogicon dwaara pratipaadit hue hai
 For example, sodium, tin and lead are chemically reacted to form the following compounds: anek antaradhaatuk yogic bahut sthaayee hote hai or apane galnaank se adhik taap par garam karne se bhi apni avyav dhaatuon main vighatit nahin hote
 These compounds dissolve in liquid ammonia and thus the solution prepared is an electronegative
 jab inkaa vaidyut apghaton kiya jaataa he, tab ek avyav dhaatu, jo duusari kii apeksha nune dhanvidyuti hoti he, dhanagar par jamati he or duusari runagra par
 There is no theoretical explanation as to why interstitial compounds are formed
 keval itnaa hi pratipaadit ho paaya he ki ve dhaatuen, jinke gun ek se hai, ek duusare ke saath sanyog nahin karti hai
 Since these types of alloys are hard, brittle, very less tensile and flexible, only a few of these are useful
 sab mishradhaatuon ko saadharantaya louh tathaa aloh mishradhaatuon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 When iron is the base metal in the alloy, then that iron and when the base metal is any other metal, then it is called non-ferrous alloy

" In fact, Ada's integrated automated software system has a profitable commercial fabric that can be used to structure and develop 3-D wrapper composite elements

 However, as a result of the successes of India's domestic industries, 70 percent of LCA parts are being manufactured in India and India's dependence on the use of imported equipment will gradually reduce in the coming years

 This necessitated a fighter aircraft with multiple roles that could intercept at high altitudes and be suitable for ground attack by staying short distances
 ASR ko isaki bhi aavashyaktaa thi ki mul sanrachana ek unnat prashikshak ke rup main or jahaaz aaparishan anukulan ke liye upyukt ho, haalanki is vikalp ko baad main chhod diya gaya
 This resulted in the creation of India's first home-grown jet fighter, the subsonic HF-24 Marut, which first flew in June 1961
 ek upyukt terbojet ingine ke vikaas or ise hasil karne main samasyaon kii vajah se maarut ko 1967 tak bhartiya vaayu sena main shaamil nahin kiya ja sakaa

 In 1969, the Government of India accepted the recommendation of its Aeronautics Committee that Hieli should design and develop advanced aircraft fighter aircraft with a proven engine
 On the basis of 'tactical air support aircraft', ASR was the same as Marut in marked form
 iske baad hieli ne 1975 main sanrachana kaa adhyayan puraa kiya, lekin videshi nirmaataaon se chune hue "kshamta siddh ingine" hasil karne main asamarthta ke kaaran yah pariyojna puri nahin ho saki
 As the production of the Ajit attack aircraft continues, the structural work for the engineers of Hieli was little left, while the requirement of the Indian Air Force for air superiority fighter aircraft with secondary air support and interception capability remained unfulfilled

 In 1984, the Aeronautical Development Agency was established for LCA program management
 kida ek prabhavi "rashtriya sangh" he, jiskaa hieli pramukh bhagidaar he
 Hieli serves as the primary contractor and has a leading responsibility for LCA structure, system integration, airframe manufacturing, aircraft finalization, flight testing, service related support

 The development of an indigenous flight control system, radar and engine for LCA can be seen as an initiative of special importance

 The PD stage is an early critical element in the aircraft structure and development process, as it results in key elements of a detailed structure, manufacturing approach, and maintenance requirements
 Furthermore, it is at this point that the overall program cost is most effectively controlled

 The LCA structure was finalized in 1990 and was intended as a small delta winged machine with "relax Static Stability" to enhance combat skills
 Almost immediately, there was some concern for some specified reasons, such as aviation electronic equipment and advanced composite infrastructure, and the Indian Air Force doubted whether India had sufficient infrastructure to support such an ambitious project
 a government review committee was formed in May 1989, which gave a general opinion that India has more sufficiency in most areas of infrastructure, facilities and technology to undertake the project
 haalanki, doordarshita ke ek kadam ke rup main yah nirnay liya gaya ki kaarykram ke purna paimaane par ejineering ke vikaas ke str ko do charnon main aage badhanaa hoga
 Phase-one will focus on "proof of Concept" and will include the structure, development and testing of two technology demonstrator aircraft and the formation of a structural sample test airframe and complete the Government of India LCA structure only after successful testing of TD aircraft
 Will support After this, the construction of two prototype vehicles and the necessary infrastructure and test facilities for the aircraft will begin
 The second phase will include the construction of three more prototype vehicles, a hard test sample and restoration of development and testing facilities at various centers
 charan-1 1990 main shuru kiya or hieli ne 1991 ke madhya main praudyogiki pradarshnon par kaam shuru kar diya, haalanki, vittiya sankat ke kaaran april 1993 tak purna paimaane par dhan adhikrut nahin kiya gaya, jiske parinamswaroop FSED ke charan-1 kaa kaam 1 june se shuru hua
 The first technology demonstrator, the TD-1, was completed on 17 November 1995 and then the TD-2 on 17 November 1998, but was kept on the ground for several years due to several structural concerns and trouble developing flight control systems
 
 elsie ke liye sabase mahatvakankshi aavashyaktaaon main se ek vinirdesan tha "relax static stability" 
 haalanki damelt ne 1988 main ek analog FCS pranali kaa prastaav diya tha, par kida ne mana ki digital udaan niyantran praudyogiki jaldi hi isaki jagah le legi

 The structure of most aircraft was "positive" for static stability, which means they have a natural tendency to return to a level and control flight in the absence of control information
 lekin yah gun payalat kii kushal prayaason ke vipareet hota hai
 On the other hand, an aircraft with "negative" static stability can divert from its level and controlled flight, unless the pilot constantly attempts to balance it, although it increases maneuverability, but it is very much up to the pilot to How much does a mechanical flight control system rely on
 FBW udaan niyantran pranali kaa vikaas udaan niyantran kanoonon or udaan niyantran computaron ke liye software code par hue mahange lekhan kaa vyapak gyaan maangata he, saath hi saath udan electranik pranali or anya electronic pranaaliyon ke saath apane ekikaran kii aavashyaktaa kii jaankaree honi bhi jaruri he
 When the LCA program was introduced, FBW was a state-of-the-art technology and was so sensitive that India could not find a country that would be ready to export it
 Therefore, the LCA National Control Law Team was formed in 1992 by the National Aeronautics Laboratory to develop its own version of India
 CLAW kii team ke vaigyanikon or ganitagyon ne apane niyantran kanoonon ko viksit karne main kamyaabi pai, lekin ve unka pareekshan nahin kar sake, kyonki bharat ke paas us samay samunnat "real time ground stimulators" nahin the
 Accordingly, in 1993 British Aerospace and Lockheed Martin were called for help, but the aeronautical development establishment's attempt to code control laws into FCS software proved to be a bigger task than previously expected
 vishisht niyantran kanoon kii samasyaon kaa BAE simulator main jaanch kii gayi
 While it was in the process of being developed, progressive elements of its coding were tested in the "minibird" and "ironbird" test rings at ADE and Hieli, respectively
 ekikrut udaan niyantran software kii F-16 VISTA par udaan ke dauraan duusari shrinkhalaa kaa simulation pareekshan kiya gaya
 Simulator, 33 test flights were completed in July 1996
 However, Lockheed Martin's involvement ended in 1998, as it was banned by the US in May that year in response to India's other nuclear tests
 NAL kii CLAW team ne ek samay swadesh main hi udaan niyantran kanoonon ke ekikaran ko safaltaapurvak puraa karne main kamyaabi pai or FCS saftware ne TD-1 par 50 ghante ke payalat pareekshan ko bina kisi rukaawat ke puraa kiya, iske parinamswaroop 2001 ke shuru main is vimaan ko udaan kii manjuuri de di gai
 In January 2001, the first flight of LCA took place from TD to the National Flight Test Center near Bangalore
 This was followed by its first successful supersonic flight on 1 August 2003
 In September 2001, the TD-2 got time to make its first flight, until 6 June 2002 it could not get this chance
 Tejas] kida kii team ne ek or mahatvapurn praudyogiki kshetra ko swadesh main viksit karne ke liye chunaa, jo tejas kaa bahu aiami radar he
 Initially it was planned for the LCA using the Ericsson microwave system PS-05 / AI / J-band multi-function radar developed for the Saab JAS-39 Gripen by Ericsson and Ferranti Defense System Integration
 haalanki, 1990 ke dashak main anya radaaron kii jaanch ke baad,drdo ko vishwaas ho gaya ki iskaa swadeshi vikaas sambhav he
 haili's Hyderabad division and LRDE were jointly selected to lead the MMR program
 haalanki yah bilkul spasht nahin he ki kab sanrachana kaa kaam shuru kiya jaayegaa, par radar vikaas kaa prayaas 1997 main shuru hua
 drdo's Center for Airborne Studies is responsible for running the testing program for MMR
 1996 or 1997 ke bich, CABS ne maujuuda hieli / HS-748M hawaii nigaraanee post testbed ko elsie ke electranik udaan pranali or radar ke test bed main parivartit kar diya, jise 'hack' kaha gaya or rotodom essembly ke alaava ekmaatr bade sanrachanaatmak parivartan ke rup main janaa gaya, iske saath elsie kii naak shanku ko MMR ke mutabik abhiyojit kiya gaya
 By 2002 MMR was reported to be experiencing development delays and cost overruns

 According to the test report, the root cause of the problem is the compatibility issue between Radar and the advanced signal processor module made by LRDE
 elta ke EL / M-2052 jaise 'aaf da self' videshi radar ko hasil karne ke antarim vikalp par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Initially, it was decided to equip the prototype aircraft with General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 afterburning turbofan engines
 ek hi saath, 1986 main, ek swadeshi bijli sanyantr ke vikaas ke liye samanaantar kaarykram shuru kiya gaya
 Under the leadership of the Gas Turbine Research Authority, the GTRE GTX-35VS, named "kaveri", was expected to replace the fully produced aircraft F404
 haalanki, takneekee kathinaaiyon ke kaaran kaveri vikaas kaarykram kii pragati dhimi ho gai
 In mid-2004, the Kaveri failed altitude tests in Russia and the final hopes of projecting it as the first production of the Tejas aircraft expired
 kaveri ke aage vikaas ke liye ek nivida jari kar companiyon ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 In February 2006, Ada contracted with French aircraft engine company Sneesma for technical assistance in solving problems in Kaveri
 us samay, DRDO ko tejas main upyog ke liye 2009-10 tak kaveri kaa ingine taiyaar hone kii aashaa hui
 In 2003, it was decided to purchase high quality General Electric F404, F404-GE-IN20 engines for eight pre-produced LSP aircraft and two naval prototypes, in view of the flaws in Kaveri's development
 kida ne farvari 2004 main ek america general electric ko 17-IN20 injanon kii abhiyantriki viksit karne va unke utpaadan ke liye 105 million america dollar kaa theka diya, jisaki aapurti 2006 main shuru hui
 In February 2007, Hieli ordered an additional F404-GE-IN20 afterburning turbofan engine to power the first operational squadron of Tejas fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force
 samay par aadesh se pehle, F404-GE-IN20 ko pareekshan ke rup main halke ladaaku vimaan main lagaaya gaya or yah 2007 ke madhya tak pareekshan udaan ke antim moolyankan kaa ek hissaa tha
 The F404-GE-IN20 engine gained thrust without installing 19,000 pounds before being installed, completing a 330-hour accelerated mission test, equivalent to a 1000-hour flight
 IN20 ne F2J3 vikaas injanon kii jagah lee, jinase 600 udaanen bhari gayi or isamen aath injanon kaa upyog kiya gaya
 In September 2008, it was announced that Cauvery would not be ready in time for Tejas and would have to choose a power plant that was in the production process
 Ada plans to issue a request proposal for a more powerful engine with a 95 to 100 kiloneuton range
 iske sambhavit daavedaar eurojet EJ200 or general electric F414 ho sakate hai
 The propulsion offering of the Eurojet EJ200 has been strongly considered
 ekal crystal terbine blade praudyogiki, jise mul rup se bhartiya vaigyanikon ko dene se inkaar kar diya gaya tha, bhi eurojet ne EJ200 ingine ke madhyam se bharat ko dene kii peshkash kii
 In May 2009, it was announced that a global tender of Rs 3,300 crore would be floated to acquire more powerful engines for the aircraft, as the current General Electric F404 engines do not generate enough strength that the aircraft with the least weapon load Be able to attack
 eurojet terbo or america company general electric elsie ke liye 100 injanon kii aapurti ke liye pratispardhaa karengi
 The Eurojet EJ200 and GE F-414 engines will meet the requirements of the Indian Air Force as they generate 95–100 kilonuton strength
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke sutron kii ore se yah bhi kaha gaya ki airfrem kii sanrachana is tarah se kii jaayegi ki isamen baari ingine lagaaye ja saken, jisamen teen-chaar saal tak kaa samay lagane kii ummid he
 However, the initial batches of Tejas aircraft will be powered by low-power General Electric F404 engines, which generate 80–85 kilonutons of strength
 disambar 1996 main, tatkaaleen vaigyanik salaahkaar apije abdul kalam ne gananaa kar isaki ikai laagat 21 lakh america dollar bataai
 In late 2001, Dr
 Kota Harinarayan, director of ADA and LCA programs, estimated the unit cost of LCA at US $ 17–2 million and stated that once production started it could cost up to US $ 150 million
 haalanki, 2001 tak dusron kaa sanket tha ki elsie kii laagat 24 million america dollars aayegaa
 At current rates it still costs US $ 21

 Once the initial operating clearance is granted, it will be included in a limited number of Indian Air Force
 After the final operating approval is obtained, it will be included on a full scale
 IOC testing is expected to be completed by 2009 and FOC testing by 2010
 swatantra vishleshkon or adhikariyon ko ummid he ki bhartiya vaayu sena main ladaaku vimaan tejas kii parichaalan aapurti 2010 ke aasapaas shuru hogi or 2010 tak iskaa seva main pravesh ho sakegaa

 This reveals the desire of the Indian Air Force that it is in a hurry to become more involved in the development of LCA as well as to include new aircraft
 yah team bangalore main tainaat he
 Senior officials of Hieli had said in March 2005 that the Indian Air Force would issue orders of Rs 2,000 crore for 20 Tejas and after that another 20 aircraft would be procured

 By February 2009, officials of the Aeronautical Development Agency said that Tejas had started flying with weapons and the integration of radar would be completed by March 2009
 Almost all system development activities will be completed by that time

 The Indian Air Force will not order any Mark-1 aircraft except for the order of 40 aircraft issued in 2005
 An order of up to 125 aircraft is being considered when the redesigned Mark-2 will be developed

 The Mark-2 Tejas version of the Indian Navy will be able to fly and take off from an aircraft carrier in a very short time
 tejas kaa nausainik sanskaran jald hi taiyaar hone kii ummid he
 Navy Chief Admiral Nirmal Verma said in his first weekly news conference of the Navy that by December 2009 DRDO has assured that the Navy version of the LCA will be ready for carrier testing by 2013 and will deploy to Gorshkov / Vikramaditya as well as Indian aircraft ships
 Will be possible
 unhone kaha ki nausena IAC-2 ke liye or adhik sakasham vaahak vimaan ke liye ek avadharanatmak adhyayan 'kar rahaa tha
 Some of the features of the "LCA version of the naval": tejas ekal ingine va vividh bhoomikaaon vaala jet ladaaku vimaan he, jisaki visheshtaayen hai poonchhrahit hona or yogic delta wing platform vaala or yah "relaxd statics stability"sanrachana vaala he, jisase vimaan kaa yudhkaushal badhaane main madad milti he
 It was originally intended to serve as a ground-attack attack aircraft as a mid-level "silent bomb" to prove air superiority, but due to the flexibility in structural considerations it would allow air to surface and navigation
 - Anti-weapon form can be integrated, allowing it to gain multiple roles and the ability to complete a variety of missions
 poonchhrahit or yogic delta planfarm kii sanrachana tejas ko chota or halkaa rakhane ke liye hai
 The use of this planform keeps control surface requirements to a minimum, allowing a wider range of external store to be carried and characterized by better close combat, higher speeds, and higher alpha roles than the cruciform structure
 vyapak paimaane par scale model par wing tunnel pareekshan model or jatil computesnal taral gatiki vishleshan se elsie kaa arodynemic vinyas kam se kam hua he, jisase ise nunatam supersonic draig, lo wing loding or role or pich kii ucch dar hasil ho sakaa he
 All weapons are carried in each branch with seven hardpoints with a total capacity of one or more 4,000 kg: three stations under each wing and one at the fuselage centerline
 vahaan bhi ek aathven portside intech trunk ke neeche ofaset stesan hota he, jo vividh tarah ke pod le ja saktaa he or yah under-fuzleg stesan ko centerline stesan or wing steshnon ke inboard jode ke antargat kar saktaa he
 Tejas have an integral internal fuel tank, which can hold 3,000 kg of fuel in the fuselage and wing and further a fixed infight refueling device towards the fuselage starboard
 bahari taur par inboard or midboard wing steshnon tathaa centerline fuzleg stesan main teen 1,200 yaa yaa paanch 800-litre eendhan tanks tak ke "wet" hardpoint praavdhaan hote hai
 LCA is made of aluminum-lithium alloys, carbon fiber composites and titanium alloy-steels
 tejas vajan ke rup main apane airfrem ke 45% hisse tak ke liye C-FC samagriyaan, jisamen ek fuzleg pankh, ilevan telphin, radar, air brake or landing gear daravaaje bhi shaamil hote hai
 The use of blending metals makes the aircraft both lighter and stronger than the all-metal structure, and the LCA c-fcs' planning percentage is one of the highest among contemporary aircraft of its category
 vimaan ko bahut halkaa banane ke alaava, vahaan unamem kam se kam jod yaa keelein hoti hai, jo vimaanon kii vishwasaneeyata ko badhaati he or sanrachanaatmak kamajori se honevaali daraar kii ashanka ko kam karti he
 Telfin for LCA is like a monolithic honeycomb piece, which can reduce production costs by up to 80% compared to a "subtractive" or "didactic" system

 Another help from the overall structure was that there were no 2,000 holes in the airframe
 Overall, this aircraft weighs less than 21%
 in karkon main se ek utpaadan laagat, ek atirikt laabh - or mahatvapurn laagat bachat kam ho sakate hai - chote se vimaan ko ikattha apekshit samay main mahasoos kiya - saat maheene he elsie ke liye ke rup main 11 maheene ke khilaaf ek sabhi dhaatu airfrem kaa istemaal karte hai
 The airframe of the Tejas' naval version will be modified with respect to nose tilt to further improve visualization when landing the aircraft, and to increase speed during flight and use wing leading edge vortex controllers
 levcons operate on control surfaces that extend from the wing root leading edge and thus the LCA can be operated optimally during slow speeds, otherwise the theda is obstructed due to increased stretch, as in delta wing structures it happens
 ek atirikt laabh yah hota he ki LEVCON bhi hamale ke ucch kone par niyantrit karne kii kshamta badhaata he
 The backside of the Naval Tejas is also strong, with a tall and strong wheel and nose wheel steering for maneuverability on the deck
 tejas kaa trainer sanskaran do siton vaale nausainik vimaan sanrachana ke saath "arodynemic kaamanlity " vaala he
 The Tejas features a three-wheeler landing gear with single inward-manhwills retractable by the catchment, and a rotatable two-wheel and forward-moving nose gear

 Alankar, an ornament used in Hindi poetry according to Chandrodaya tripitak The Abhidhammapitaka is a Buddhist book
 yah un teen granthon main se ek he jo tripitak banaate he
 Analyzed deshāna and religious interpretation are stored in this book
 parampara main kaha gaya he ki buddha ne apane gyaan ke turant baad abhimamma ko sochaa tha, phir kuch saal baad devataaon ko sikhaaya
 Later Buddha repeated it to Sariputta, who handed it over to his disciples
 yah parampara paariwaar main bhi spasht he, vinay pitaka ke bahut der se, jo buddha kii prashansa kii ek antim kavita main ullekh karti he ki is sabase achche jeev, sher ne teen pitaakon ko sikhaaya
 However, scholars usually undertake abhidhamma to produce some time around the third century BC, 100 to 200 years after Buddha's death
 isliye, saat abhimamma kaaryon kaa aamtaur par vidwaanon dwaara daawa kiya jaataa he ki buddha ke shabdon kaa pratinidhitiv na karen, balki shishyon or vidwaanon ke un logon kaa pratinidhitiv na karen
 Rupert Gethin, however, stated that important elements of the Abhidhamma system would probably return in the lifetime of the Buddha
 e ke worder or peter harvey donon ne mataka ke liye shuruaati tithiyon kaa suzav diya jis par abibimmaa kitaaben aadhaarit hai
 Abhidham started as an extension of Sutta, but later developed independent theories
 canan ke aakhri bade vibhaajan ke rup main, abhimamma pitak ke paas ek chacord itihaas tha
 It was not accepted as canonical by the Mahasanghika School and many other schools
 abhyamma pitak ke bheetar ek anya skool main khudaaka nikayaa kaa adhikansh hissaa shaamil tha
 Furthermore, the Pali version of the Abhidhamma is strictly a Theravada collection, and has little in common with the Abhidhamma works recognized by other Buddhist schools
 vibhinn praarambhik vidyalayon ke vibhinn abhimmaa darshanon par siddhant par koi samjhauta nahin he or 'vibhajit buddha dharm' kii avadhi se sambandhit he
 There is no mention of the texts of Abhidhamma Pitaka in the early texts of the Pali canon

 It only appears during Buddhaghosa iskaa vistaar is prakaar he- In astronomy, constellations refer to a group of stars appearing in the sky
 itihaas main vibhinn sabhyataaon nen akaash main taron ke bich main kalpit rekhaayen khinchakar kuch akritiyaan prathit kii hai jinhen unhone naam de die
 For example, in ancient India there is a planetarium named Mrigashirsha, which in Greek civilization is called Oraian, which means "hunter"
 pracheen bharat main taramandalon ko nakshatra kaha jaataa tha
 In modern-day astronomy, constellations are called groups of the same stars, which are internationally agreed with the International Astronomical Union
 aadhunik yug main kisi taron ke taramandal ke ird-gird ke kshetra ko bhi usee taramandal kaa naam de diya jaataa he
 Thus the entire celestial sphere has been divided into different constellations
 agar yah bataanaa ho ki koi khagoleey vastu ratri main akaash main kahan milegi to yah bataaya jaataa he ki vah kis taramandal main sthit he
 Keep in mind that stars and other objects appearing in a planetarium may appear close to each other when viewed from the earth, but this is not necessarily the case
 jis tarah dur dekhne par do pahaad ek-duusare ke nazadik lag sakate hai lekin sameep jane par pataa chalata he ke unamem bahut faaslaa he or ek pahaad vastav main duusare pahaad se milon peeche he
 "planetarium" was called "nakshatra" in Sanskrit and in various Indian languages this word is used even today
 taramandal ko angrezi main "constlation" or arabi main "majamua-al-nazoom" kehete hai
 The constellation consists of stars and celestial objects, which, when viewed from the surface of the Earth, are permanently visible in the same area in the sky
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he kii ye vastav main ek-duusare ke paas hai yaa inkaa aapas main koi mahatvapurn gurutvkarshan bandhan he
 In contrast, the stars of the trilateral are actually in a cluster and have a gravitational bond between themselves

 The purpose of the incarnation of Lord Shree Kalki, the era transformer, is stated to be Vishwakalyan
 bhagwaan kaa yah avatar ‘‘nishkalank bhagwaan’’ ke naam se bhi janaa jaayegaa
 The stories of the incarnations of Vishnu are described in detail in the Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana
 iske barahawein skandh ke dwitiya adhyay main bhagwaan ke kalki avatar kii katha vistaar se di gai he jisamen yah kaha gaya he ki "sambhal gram main vishnuyash naamak shreshth brahman ke putr ke rup main bhagwaan kalki kaa janm hoga

 Lord Shri Kalki will have two wives - Padma in the form of Lakshmi and Rama in the form of Vaishnavi Shakti
 unke putr honge - jai, vijay, meghmal tathaa balaahak
 The nature of God is supreme and divine
 unke sparup kii kalpana unke param anugrah se hi kii ja sakati he
 Lord Shri Kalki is the eternal hero of the universe
 shakti purushottam bhagwaan shri kalki adwitiya hai
 Lord Shri Kalki is riding on the milk color ie white horse

 The color of God is blond, but also black in anger

 There are many categories of avatars mentioned in the texts, such as Ansashavatar, Anshvatar, Aveshvatar, Kalavatar, Nityavatar, Yugavatar
 jo bhi saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth ko vyakt karata he ve sabhi avatar kehalaate hai
 From the person to the highest level of the society, in order to express the universal truth-principles, various categories of avatars are leveled
 antim saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth ko vyakt karne vaala hi antim avatar ke rup main vyakt hoga
 The avatars, prophets, messengers, etc

 Like other incarnations of Vishnu, Kalki is not mentioned in the Vedas
 lekin puraanon main kalki avatar kaa vistaar se varnan hai
 Both Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana mention the Kalki avatar
 kalki puraana to puri tarah se isi avatar par kendrit hai
 According to almost all the Puranas, Kalki will be born at the home of a Brahmin Vishnu
 kalki bhagwan shiv ke bhakt honge or unke guru parashuram hongen
 In the Kalki Purana, the story of the birth and family of "kalki" avatar is conceived as follows- "in the village named Shambhal, a Brahmin named Vishnuyash will reside, who will marry a woman named Sumati, both will spend the day in religious work
 kalki unke ghar main putr hokar janm lenge or alpaayu main hi vedadi shastron kaa paath karke mahapandit ho jaayenge
 Later, they will be overcome by the misery of the creatures and worship Mahadev and obtain astravidya who will be married to Padmadevi, the daughter of Brihadratha
 “ Just as it is impossible to determine the name of any person who is born in the future in general practical way, it is impossible to determine his parents, place of birth and wife as well
 dhyaan dene yogya yah he ki sabhi avatar, paigambar, ishdoot ityadi rajtantr vyavastha kaal main aaye the
 When the Kalki Purana was written there was a monarchical system, so the story of the future Kalki is completely in the same style as the story of other incarnations
 vishvaman ke ansh kii anubhuti kisi bhi vyakti se vyakt ho sakati he jiskaa prakshepan yaa prastutikaran us samay or vyakti kii apni samskruti ke madhyam se hi hota he
 Yet Kalki Katha also has some meaning
 sambhal- In the Kali Yuga of Kalki avatar being in the context of Hindustan, all Hindus agree, but there are many differences in where Sambhal is
 kuch vidwaan sambhal ko urisa, himalay, punjab, bengal or shankarpur main maanate hai
 Some consider Sambhal in China's cabbage desert where humans cannot reach
 kuch vrindavan main maanate hai
 Some consider Sambhal in Moradabad district where Kalki Avatar Temple is also there
 vichaarneey vishay ye he ki ”sambhal main kalki avatar hoga yaa jahaan kalki avatar hoga vahi sambhal hoga
 “sambhal literally means to be equally good or peace or peace, that is, where there is peace and peace or peace is spread
 kalki puraana main sambhal main 68 tirtho kaa vaas bataaya gaya he
 In Saliyug, only Sambhal will be the only pilgrimage place that will be a welfare and peacemaker
 tirth kaa arth- pavitra sthaan, darshan, dil, man, hriday, ghat, talab, pani kaa sthaan, amar jivan daata jal, logon ke aane jane or jamghat ke sthaan ke arth main hota he
 Brahmin father Vishnuyash and mother Sumati- According to the Kalki Purana, the name of the father and mother of the Kalki avatar will be Vishnuyash and Sumati, which dictates not the name but the qualities
 brahman arthath jo veda, puraana or shuddh param chaitanya ko jaanata ho
 Vishnu means God, the omnipresent God who is present in all places, the creator of the universe
 yash arthath stuti yaa prashansa karne vaala
 In this way, Father Vishnu's meaning is that of a father who is praising and praising the all-pervading God and is benevolent of all
 isi prakaar sumati kaa arth hota he- sundar yaa acha mat yaa vichaar rakhana
 Wife of Kalki Avatar - In Kalki Purana ”kalki“ avatar ke vishay main kaha gaya he ki- ”unka vivaah brihadrath kii putree padmadevi ke saath hoga
 "but according to the story based on the film displayed on Maa Vaishno Devi", a booklet sold in connection with the story of Vaishno Devi in katra and Jammu and Gulshan Kumar, "trikuta told Sriram - she accepted him as a husband
 Have done shriram ne use bataaya ki unhone is avatar main keval sita ke prati nishthavan rahane kaa vachan liya he lekin bhagwaan shriram ne use aashwaasan diya ki kaliyug main ve kalki ke rup main prakat hogen or usase vivaah karegein
 " shriramcharitamanas ke kiskindhakand main ek devi kaa varnan miltaa he
 He gave water and fruits to Hanumanji and other Banar Birs and took them out of the cave and brought them to the shore of the ocean
 ye devi swayamprabha hai
 This goddess is revered as Mother Vaishnav
 kalyug ke antim charan main bhagwaan kaa kalki avatar hoga
 Then these Kalki God will punish the wicked and establish religion on earth
 tathaa devi swayamprabha se shriramavatar main die gaye vachananusaar vivaah karenge
 That is, the Kalki avatar will be given to Vaishno Devi who has been in the body in the form of ages, which will be "mother Kalki Devi", the realization of "mother Vaishno Devi"
 sharir rup - Evidence of the incarnation is also found in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita composed by Maharishi Vyasa and the eighth incarnation of God, Shri Krishna
 yada-yada hi dharmasy glanirbhavatee bharatah
 Adyuthatanam Dharmasya Tadatmanam Srjamyaham
 
 That means India! The period when there is loss of religion and there is excess of unrighteousness
 us kaal main hi main apni aatma ko prakat karata hoon
 In this way, the body of Kalki avatar will be of human being, which will reveal the form of soul and will be Krishna form
 karm rup – kalki mahauvataar safed ghode par savaar hokar haath main talwaar lekar samast buraaiyon kaa naash karegein
 Symbols are used in any religious scriptures to represent ideas because there is no shape of thought
 is prakaar kalki avatar ke arth ko spasht karne par ham pate hai ki safed ghoda arthath shaanti kaa pratik yaa ahimsak maarg, talwaar arthath gyaan arthath saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth jisase sabhi kaa maansik vadh hoga
 If we take these symbols in the same form, then in today's era, how many people are possible to kill with a sword in the age of one science based weapon, that is, and how much physical strength will that person be, it is a matter of consideration? parinaam sirf ek he keval maansik vadh jo maatr saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth se hi sambhav he
 And religion has been established by past incarnations using physical and economic reasons
 kalki puraana katha rachanaakaar tab ye soch bhi nahin paye hogen ki bhavishya main drishy padaarth vigyaan aadhaarit drishy kaal or niraakaar samvidhan aadhaarit ek nai vyavastha bhi aa jaayegi or us vakt raja or rajtantr nahin hoga tab kalki avatar kiskaa vadh karegein? davy yaa vishwa rup - kalki avatar ke guno ke anusaar karm karne ke satya rup ko ek kadam badhaate huye tathaa anek karm ke pratik anek hatho vaala dikhaaya gaya he
 This makes it clear that one Karma will be accomplished by the Kalki avatar and because of that, karma will start with many hands, that is, they will be able to say that "I am doing karma with many hands and all are doing karma with my own Karmgyan
" 
 “ After the Gita, the scripture of universal truth knowledge, there is a need for universal karma, which is a phase of the work of Kalki avatar
 gyaan rup - antim saarvbhaum satya-siddhanth kaa gyaan hi antim avatar kaa gyaan rup hoga, jiske nimna kaaran hogen

 a death occurring to work with a patient of the heart and lungs can be determined to be legally declared dead without a dead brain
 Accurate definition of death is medical, in other words more ironically advances scientific knowledge and medicine
 Becomes problematic
 mrityu yaa majboot sanket ke lakshan he ki ek vyakti ab bhi zindaa hai: The concept of death is the key event
 There are many scientific methods for conceptualizing
 udhaaharan ke liye, mastishk mrityu, vigyaan ke rup main chikitsa abhyaas main, mastishk gatividhi ke dauraan rahata he jo samay ke rup main paribhaashit maut ek bindu main
 ek maut main paribhaashit karne kii chunautiyon ke jivan se yah bhed he
 As a point in time, it appears to refer to the moment of death at which life ends
 haalanki, jab nirdhaaran maut hui he jivan or maut ke bich vaicharik simaaon sateek drawing kii aavashyaktaa he
 This is problematic because there is little consensus over how to define life
 yah sambhav he chetana ke sandarbh main jivan ko paribhaashit
 jab chetana rahata he, ek jivit jeev ke liye mar gaya he kaha ja saktaa
 is drushtikon main ullekhneey kharabi kii, haalanki, ki vahaan kai jeev jo jivit hai lekin shaayad udhaaharan ke liye nahin sachet kar rahe hai, ekal sayled jeev is drushtikon ke saath ek or samasya chetana he, jo kai alag alag aadhunik vaigyanikon, manovaigyanikon or darshanikon dwaara di gai paribhaasha ke paribhaashit karne main kiya jaataa he
 This common problem of defining death applies to the specific challenge of defining death in the context of medicine
 ke bare main kuch vighn charitra par dhyaan kendrit maut ke liye paribhaashaayen anya
 is sandarbh main "" maut keval rajya he jahaan kuch rah gai he, jaise, jivan varnan karata he
 Thus, "the definition of life together defines death
" aitihaasik, ek insaan kii mrityu ke kshan ko paribhaashit karne kaa prayaas samasyagrast kiya gaya he
 And arrest is defined as a once-off heart beat, but the development of CPR and early defibrillation is insufficient definition provided that breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted
 Incidents of death which were now associated in any previous condition without killing everyone in a functioning heart or lungs, can be a continuous combination of life support devices, sometimes with prostheses and prostheses
 aaj, ek mrityu ke kshan kii paribhaasha, aavashyak jahaan doctoron or coroners aamtaur par naidanik mrit baari karne ke liye mastishk "mrityu" yaa jaivik "maut hone ke ek vyakti ke rup main paribhaashit karne ke liye", logon ko mrit mana jaataa he jab unke mastishk gatividhi vidyut rahata he
 It is believed that an end of electrical activity is also a sign of an end of consciousness
 haalanki, chetana ke nilamban or sthai hona chahie, na kshanik, ke rup main charnon neend ke dauraan kuch hota he or vishesh rup se coma
 sone ke maamle main, anada antar kar sakate hai aasaani se bataata he However, the category "brain death" is seen by some scholars to be problematic
 For example, Dr
 Franklin Miller, senior faculty member of the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes, "since the 1990s, however, humans were increasingly being challenged by scholars, based on evidence of death
" The equations of brain death with respect to the array of biological functioning exhibited by patients correctly conditioned on mechanical ventilation for a considerable period of time
 Placed as being identifies maintained the ability to keep these patients to maintain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and most dramatically, to gestate fetuses for " un logon ko banaae rakhane kii maut he ki praantastha-ke nav keval ke liye aavashyak he kabhi kabhi mastishk chetana kaa tark he ki keval vidyut gatividhi ko paribhaashit karnaa chahie ho saktaa he jab mana jaataa he
 Ultimately it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function, brain death as a whole

 In a July 2007 newspaper interview, Sam Burnett, a close friend of Morrison's, revived an old rumor and announced that Morrison's death was in fact an overdose of heroin in Paris' left bank rock 'n' roll circus nightclub
 Took place Burnett claims that Morrison came to the club to buy heroin for Karsan and that he himself consumed it a little and died in the bathroom
 bernet kaa aarope he ki vahi do drug dealer morrison ko uthaakar rayu bayutrelis apartment le gayi or bathtub main daal diya jinase usne heroin kharidi thi
 Burnett says that night the people who saw Morrison had sworn secrecy to protect the famous club from the scandal, and some eyewitnesses left the country immediately
 However, this is a refinement in many old rumors and conspiracy hypotheses on Morrison's death and is not corroborated by witnesses such as the statements of Rouné and Karsan

 In the 1990s, Morrison's father George Stephen Morrison laid a flat stone on the tomb
 The Greek inscription on the stone is: ΚΑΤΑ ΤΟΝ ΔΑΙΜΟΝΑ ΕΑΥΤΟΥ, which literally means "according to his own wonderful talent" and which is usually interpreted as "true to his own ideology"
 mikulin ne baad main morrison kii or bhi do kaansya pratimaayein banaayin, lekin is kabr par koi nayi murti lagane ke liye license kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 In his will made in Los Angeles County on February 12, 1969, Morrison inherited all his assets to Karsan, in addition to appointing him as co-executor with his attorney Max Fink; She thus became the heir to all of her property after Morrison's death in 1971

 Biographers have been talking about many writers and philosophers who had an influence on Morrison's thinking and possibly his behavior as well
 Morrison researched the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche when he was still in his teens
 unhone wiliam blake, charles bodeler or arthur rimbod ko bhi kavitaaon main rekhaankit kiya
 Beat generation writers such as Jack Kerouac also had a profound influence on Morrison's approach and manner of expression; Morrison was eager to experience the life described in Kerouac's On the Road

 Morrison later met the legendary Beat poet Michael mcclur and the two became friends
 morrison ke geeton kaa macclur ne rasaswadan kiya, parantu ve unki kavita se adhik prabhavit hue or unhen apni is kala ko viksit karne ke liye protsaahit kiya
 Morrison's vision of a performance by the Living Theater of 20th-century French playwrights Antonin Artaud and Julian Beck filled the vibrancy

 Morrison's interpretation of the Native Americans' "sweep" tradition was used as part of their stage routine; This can be seen especially in his renditions of Ghost Dance and later in his album Poetry of the Ghost Song

 Wallace Fowley, Duke University's retired professor of French literature, wrote Rimbaud and Jim Morrison, subtitled "the Rebel as Poet - a Memoir"
 In this book, Fowley recalls his surprise when he received a letter of appreciation from Morrison in 1968, thanking him for his recent translation of Arthur Rimbaud's poem into English
 "main aasaani se francisi nahin padhata",


 unhone likhaa, "

 Creed's Scott Stapp, including Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver's Scott Weiland, says Morrison has a big influence on him and is his biggest motivator
 stone temple payalts or velvet revolver donon hi da dorce dwaara "rodhouse blues" ke antargat kiye gayi
 The rest of The Doors hired Weiland to perform in place of Morrison for "break on Through"
 Stapp replaced Morrison for "light My Fire", "riders on the Storm" and "road House Blues" on VH1 storytellers
 1999 woodstock mahotsav ke liye kride ne robi krigar ke saath unke "rides on da storm" ke sanskaran main pradarshan kiya
 The rest of The Doors' book quotes Morrison's close friend Frank Lisiandro to the extent that many commented on Morrison that he was interested in rebellion, chaos and anarchy, "implying that he was an anarchist, a revolutionary , Or worse, was an atheist

 Balakrishna reached Rishikesh in 1948
 ve dekhnaa chaahate the ki bharat ke sant mahatma kitne upyogi anupayogi he
 On reaching there, he came to know about Swami Shivanand
 ve dakshin ke rahane vaale the or unki bhashaa angreji thi
 For this reason, Balkrishna reached his own ashram
 vahaan ve swami ji kii sweekruti se anya ashramavaasiyon ke saath rahane lage
 Although he did not believe in any religious act at that time, the devotees started following the Ashram people like a man
 ve praat: kaal ganga ji main snaan karte, siankal prarthana main sammilit hote or ashram ke kaam bhi karte
 At the same time, he was impressed by Swami Shivanand ji and took initiation of renunciation from him
 ab unka naam swami chinmayanand ho gaya
 He began to study with his guru one book each of the Path - Darshan library
 din bhar padhane ke liye paryaapt samay rahata
 There was no electricity in the ashram in those days
 isliye raat ke samay padhane kii suvidha nahi thi
 Swamiji used to think about the subjects read throughout the day at that time
 kuch dinon baad unka adhyayan gahan ho gaya or ve bade gambheer chintan main vyast rahane lage
 Seeing his condition, Swami Shivanand ji sent him to Swami Tapovan ji to study the Upanishads
 un dinon swami tapovana maharaj uttarkashi main vaash karte the
 Staying with him, he studied Vedanta for about 8 years
 tapovana ji ko koi jaldi nahin thi
 He used to teach for an hour every day
 shesh samay shishy manan - chintan main vyateet karata tha
 This study was not only intellectual but also practical
 swami ji ko apni guru ke shiksha anusaar sanyamee, virakt or shant rahane kaa abhyaas karnaa hota tha
 As a result, Swamiji's nature completely changed
 jivan or jagat ke prati unki dharna badal gai
 Swami Chinmayanand ji renounced his physical body on August 3, 1993, in the city of San Diego, USA
 adhyayan samaapt karne ke baad swami ji ke man me lok seva karne kaa vichaar prabal hone laga
 After getting approval from Tapovan Ji, he went towards South India and reached Poona
 vahaan unhone apana pratham gyaan yajna kiya
 This was a new type of experiment

 She slowly started growing
 lagbhag ek maheene ke gyaan yajna ke baad ve madras chale gayi or vahaan doosraa gyaan yajna prarambh kiya
 In these yagyas, Swamiji himself preached and performed the yajna himself
 kuch samay baad hi unke sahaayak taiyaar hue or phir usne ek sanstha kaa rup le liya
 Gradually, the demand for his discourses started increasing
 swami ji ne bhi gyaan - yajna kaa samay ek maheene se ghataakar pandrah din yaa phir or phir das din yaa saat din kar diya
 These Yajna sacrifices were first held in big cities of India, then in small cities

 Symmetrical components are most commonly used for analysis of three-phase electrical power systems
 If the phase quantities are expressed in phasor notation using complex numbers, a vector can be formed for the three phase quantities
 For example, a vector for three phase voltages could be written as where the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 refer respectively to the zero, positive, and negative sequence components
 The sequence components differ only by their phase angles, which are symmetrical and so are 2 3 π { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ frac {2}{3}} \ pi } radians or 120°
 Define the operator α { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ alpha } phasor vector forward by that angle
 Note that α3 = 1 so that α − 1 = α2
