 There are several diactric marks that alter the vowel sound of a letter
 Two diacritics are used exclusively for Pali and are rarely seen elsewhere
 One or more of these accents can be added to a consonant to change its sound
 In addition, other modifying symbols are used to differentiate tone and sound, but are not considered diacritics
 There are four methods of romanization of Burmese script
 iname se do pranaliyaan lipyantaran kahi ja sakati hai tathaa anya do kaa jor uccharan par he isaliye unhen taanscripshan kah sakate hai
 Transliteration systems - see also MLC Transcription System and ALA-LC Romanization
 taanscripshan pranaliyaan hai- BGN / PCGN romanization tathaa John Okell dwaara prayukt pranali
 a detailed discussion of these systems is given in the following tables
 Syllable onsets kaa romaneekaran nimnavat kiya jaataa he- The romanization of syllable rhymes is done as follows
 is sarini main burmi varna 'k' က saanchaa:ipachar ko aadhaar ke rup main prayog kiya gaya he
 In sequences with ွ or ဝ before တ ်, န ်, ပ်, မ် or together with ံ, the vowel pronounced is: ipachar rather than the expected mold: ipachar
 This is reflected in the BGN / PCGN and Okell transcriptions, but not in the MLCTS and ALA-LC transliterations
 The independent vowel letters are transcribed the same as the vowels formed with အ, except in ALA-LC, where those formed with အ take a preposed apostrophe : The low tone and checked tone are represented as shown in the table above
 The representation of the high tone and creaky tone varies depending on the respective syllable rhyme: sometimes they are inherent in the vowel symbol used, and sometimes they are indicated by a diacritic mark
 The ALA-LC romanization indicates these two tones explicitly only in cases where diacritic marks are used; the other three romanizations indicating them regardless of how they are spelled
 Examples: Minor syllables in Burmese contain only the vowel saanchaa:ipachar in the rhyme and do not bear tone
 They are always followed by a major syllable 
 In the orthography, they are most commonly spelled as if their rhyme was saanchaa:ipachar, but are often spelled in other ways
 In the MLCTS and ALA-LC systems, minor syllables are romanized exactly as they are spelled in Burmese orthography
 In the modified BGN / PCGN system and in the Okell system, minor syllables are indicated by the letter ă regardless of the Burmese orthography
 Examples: Where two consonants appear next to each other between two vowels in a romanization, use hyphens as necessary to avoid ambiguity
 For example: In many words, a written voiceless consonant is pronounced voiced when it appears after a vowel or saanchaa:ipachar
 This is indicated in the BGN-PCGN and Okell transcriptions, but not in the MLCTS and ALA-LC transliterations
 In BGN-PCGN, the letter for the voiced consonant is used; in Okell, the letter for the voiceless consonant is used but underlined

 In this 'stormy era', the spirit of revolution appeared like a raging storm, which razed the ruins of old ideas and shabby principles
 iske pashchaat uske jivan ke madhyahn main france kii raajnneetik kranti kaa tufaan aayaa jisane puraani vyavastha kii bhitti hilaa di or lakhon vyaktiyon ke hriday main swarnyug ke sundar swapn kaa srijan kiya, yadhyapi yah swapn mrigamarichika ke samaan hi kshanik siddh hua, kyonki isi ke garbh se napolian kaa aavirbhaav hua, jisaki drutagami vijayvahini ne europe main aashaa ke sthaan par purna nairashya kaa samrajya sthapit kiya
 Finally, in the twilight of his life, he fully experienced the extensive changes of the Industrial Revolution and also saw the rise of the new economic system which was slowly becoming clear by breaking the old structure of the society
 in sabhi anubhavon kii chhap uski kritiyon main spasht he, kyonki uskaa samvedansheel hriday bahya paristhitiyon se twarit prabhavit hota tha
 He was a very lucky man
 uske jivan main abhaav kii chaaya kabhi nahin ai

 His strong writing created an abundance of lyrical poetry, epics, novels, plays, and critical works, and he did not touch any subject leaving him unaffected by his power, novelty and originality
 gete kii vibhinn kritiyon main uske vyaktigat anubhavon kaa samavesh hua he or un sabhi ko ek sutara main baandhanevaala tatv uskaa vyaktitv he jo samay ke saath saath viksit hota rahaa

 But with the maturation of Mastash, the dignity of the sentiment and the sophistication of the language and the complexity of the verses began to grow and eventually his words became burdensome with the expressions and the expressions of the heart were controlled by the discipline of the mind
 iskaa arth yah he ki usne apane vyaktitv kii virdohi pravritiyon main samanvay sthapit karne kaa safal prayaas kiya or uskaa samast sahitya tathaa darshan isi tarah se samanvay ke punit kartavya kaa upadesh detaa he
 He emphasized that the introverted nature of man is harmful and it is necessary to make it extroverted so that there can be healthy harmony between the individual and society, soul and external nature
 is tathy kaa parichay uski sabhi kritiyon main miltaa he
 His lyrical poetry begins with personal love, but in the long run his strong connection to man and nature is his main subject - the nature that is cosmic and with which the soul of man has an unwavering relationship because the diverse beings of creation are tied in the thread of unity
 uske teen pradhan upanyaas bhi uske vikaas ke teen vibhinn pahaluon ke dyotak hai
 The first and most well-known among them is 'vardar', an impressive portrait of the soul of 'romantic' Europe

 Plays have a special place in Goethe's works and the main ones are 'gotze', 'yagmant', 'ifegini', 'taso' and 'foust'
 yahan par itnaa kahana hi paryaapt hoga ki ‘foust’ gete kii pratibha kaa sarvottam pratik tathaa vishwasahitya kaa amuly ratna he
 The history of its creation is the history of the development of 'goethe' and the life story of the protagonist of the play is the story of the development of the human soul
 ‘foust’ madhyayugin loksahitya kaa purvaparichit paatr he jisko gete ne maanavtaa kaa pratik mana he
 This person is initially beset with ego like a warder, but gradually his mind is attracted towards other persons and the external world

 The explanation of 'faust' is quite detailed
 gete kii paini drushti ne bahut se tatwon kaa avishkaar kiya jinka viksit rup kalantar main bodhgamy hua
 His works contain the core tenets of evolutionism and Marxism and they also find substantial support for the ideology that made autocratic rulers and leaders like Hitler popular in Germany and worthy of the public's reverence and worship, although all their power was the work of demolition
 i wasted angreji ke prasiddh kavi ornald ne gete ko ‘louh yug kaa chikitsak’ bataaya he, par gete ke vichaar aaj bhi naveen tathaa sajiv hai
 The words of praise he has used for Kalidasa's Shakuntal are also suitable for his creations - because even the Saurabh of Vasantha and the sweet juice of Shishir are perfectly mixed

 Deepstamb, Deepghar, or Lighthouse, are built to guide ships to key locations on the coastline, on islands, on cliffs, or on the banks of rivers and lakes
 inase raat ke samay prakaash nikalataa he
 It transmits light rays from any system
 puraane samay main aag jala kar yah kaam hote the, kyonki vartmaan samay main vidyut evam anya kai saadhan hai
 Its purpose is to warn the sailors or sailors of the sea with dangerous rocks
 ye patharilii tatarekha, khatarnaak chattaanon va bandargahon kii surakshit pravesh ko suchit karne ke liye hote hai
 The use of these light lamps has been very frequent in the past, due to their expensive maintenance and other advanced facilities including GPRS technology has reduced a lot
 kehete hai, sikandriyaa ke nikat faros dweep main lagbhag 280 varsh isvi purv sangmarmar kaa ek dipastambh banaaya gaya tha, jo 600 foot unchaa tha
 It was counted among the seven wonders of the world and was so famous that pharaohs became a common name in the west for lampstands and came to be known as lampstand-making-science, phrenology
 par 13veen shatee main bukamp se vah nasht ho gaya
 Thus, although the history of Deepstambha is more than two thousand years old, the regular arrangement of Deepstambha as a means of saving life started in the 19th century itself
 bhinn-bhinn sthanon kii paristhitiyon or aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar dipastambhon kii sanrachana bhanti-bhanti kii hoti he
 Places built on land, or on large islands, design of lampstands are often the same
 antar keval yah rahata he ki paraas ke anusaar, arthath prayek dipastambh se jitani dur tak prakaash dikhaai dena apekshit he uske anusaar hi, uski oonchaai or prakaash upkaran rakhe jate hai
 But marine lighthouses, which are built on a deserted rock lying in the open sea where fierce waves hit day and night, are in fact the victorious pillars of engineering skill
 sanyukt rajya america kii aligator rif kaa, great britain ke adistone, belrock or scarivor ke france kaa brihat dipastambh is drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 Four types of composition of marine lampstands are notable: 1
 chinai yaa kancreet kii sanrachana chattaane par khadi karne ke liye acchhee samajhi jaati he
 This composition is suitable by placing casks inside the sea, or elsewhere where a concrete foundation can be laid
 is prakaar kii rachana main yah vishesh dhyaan rakhata padataa he ki : 2
 An open, steel or iron molded structure is suitable for those where concrete or other types of foundations are required in a rough or sandy area
 saikat vela yaa muunge kii chattan par or aise sthanon par bhi yah upyukt hoti he, jahaan anya saamagree mahangi ho tathaa rachana khadi karne kii suvidha vishesh rup se vichaarneey ho
 In the ground, full boulders of iron or steel are fastened like screws and the structure is erected on them
 3
 dhalwaan lohe kii kalaidaar minar vahaan upyukt hoti he jahaan pathar kii unchi laagat or paryaapt shramik na milane ke kaaran chinai kaa stambh bahut mahanga padaa ho
 4
 The structure erected on the foundation of the casks can be successful only in hundreds of bella or sandy soil
 granite ke bane hue 140 foot unche saamaanya dipastambh main, jiske aadhaar kaa vyas 42 foot or upar kaa vyas 16 foot ho, lagbhag 58,580 ghan foot chinai hoti he
 There are usually four Deeppals in each sea lamp, three of which remain in Deepghar and the fourth on the coast
 sthal deepagharon main dipapal apana parivaar bhi rakh sakate hai
 Therefore, when there is a mist sign in them, then three three, otherwise only two, remain Deeppal
 great britain, france or sanyukt raashtra, america, jaise deshon main ta samudratat par badi sankhya main dipastambh hai or unki vyavastha ke liye vishesh sarkari santhaan hai, kintu bharat main samudratal abhi tak vaisaa mahatv nahin praapt kar sakaa
 Only two lampstands are notable here: one on the Alagwara rock in the Bay of Bengal, which was built in 1865 and the other near Bombay, which was built in 1874
 pracheen dipastambhon kii chotii main praaia: ek jaali ke upar koyala yaa lakdi ke kunde jalaakar prakaash kiya jaataa tha
 That system used to be very expensive
 kahin-kahin to saal main 400 ton koyala lag jaataa tha, phir bhi praaia: sadaa badalati hui jalwaayu or vaataavaran main prakaash kaa nirantar dikhaai dena anishchit hi rahata tha
 Such a system of light remained until the middle of the 19th century, though oil was also used in the 18th century
 19veen shatee main kolgas kaa prayog hua
 In 1898, the French Deepdhar Service planted incandescent mineral oil seals
 aajkal saare sansar main praaia: ye hi lagate hai
 There is a slight distinction from place to place
 uddipt khanij tel jwalak kaa siddhant yah he ki ek vaashpitra main dabaav ke saath drav khanij tel kaa ant:kshep hota he, jahaan vah kuch gaun jeton dwaara garam hokar vaashp ban jaataa he
 The vapor comes out of a spout and reaches a cell on top of the flame carrying some air with it, where the two together turn into combustible gas, stirring the mantle
 saath hi thodi si gas gaun jeton main bhi pahunchati he
 Some amount of compressed air is kept constant by a hand pump, so that pressure is available for injection
 tel gas kaa prayog gat shatabdi ke aathven dashak main aarambh hua
 Oil gases are filled at nine to ten times the pressure of the atmosphere in large casks, which have to be transported from time to time in lighthouses
 aesetilin kii lau main swany hi chamak bahut hoti he or is gas kaa yatayaat suvidhajanak he
 Therefore, it is used throughout the world for light in sows and signs, it is used for non-critical lighthouses and even in places where attendants do not live
 chamak badhaane ke liye kabhi kabhi mantilawaale jwalak bhi lagaae jate hai
 Some incandescent burners emit a similar brilliance as mineral oil-vapor-flame
 kuch prakashastambh adhikari carbide or pani se maukey par hi gas banaanevaale sanyantr bhi istemaal karte hai
 Electricity has also been used at some places for lighting
 laalatenen - bahut chote-chote stabhon ko chhodkar shesh praaia: sabhi prakashastambhon main sheersh par bani ek laalaten ke bheetar prakaash upkaran rakhe jate hai
 The yards of the lantern vials are very strong, but as thin as possible, so that they have the least obstruction in the release of light
 laalaten kaa upree bhaag gumbad kii tarah hota he, jisamen garmi baahar nikalne ke liye ek sanvatak rahata he
 Adequate ventilation is very important
 laalaten kii naap, usamen rakhe janevaale prakaash upkaran ke anusaar bhinn bhinn hoti he
 It can have a diameter of up to five feet in small columns, while it is usually 14 feet in first-class columns and 12 feet in second-class columns
 badi laalatenon kaa shishe laga bhaag lagbhag 10 foot unchaa hota he
 The glass is usually 1 / 4 inch thick and folded to suit the roundness of the lantern
 jahaan tut foot kaa bhay adhik hota he, vahaan 12 inch tak motaa sheesha lagaaya jaataa he
 The roof of the lantern is usually of iron, or copper
 ye chaadaren ispaat, ganmetal yaa dhale lohe kii kadiyonwale dhaanche main kasi rahati hai
 In some lighthouses, it has also been necessary that a lattice or jungle be installed on the outside so that the sea birds do not break the glass due to injury
 laalaten kaa barja, hathpattee or pramukh dhatvik rachana taditsanvahak se judi hui honi chahie
 Tempering should be 1 / 4 inch thick copper rod and up to 18 inches above the ventral part
 iskaa neeche kaa sira jal ke nimnatam jal se bhi neeche tak janaa chahie, yaa sire par 20 inch lambii, 12 inch chaudee or 1 / 2 inch moti bhupattica lagaakar geeli bhoomi main gaad deni chahie
 Lighting Equipment - The demerits of Sthadeep were particularly experienced in the last leg of the 19th century
 inkaa prayog dhire-dhire kam ho gaya or inke sthaan par paristhitivishesh ke anukool, vishesh prakaar ke prakaash kii aavashyata samajhi gai
 Bhramideep, in which coverings occur from time to time, was considered more appropriate
 prachhaadan ke liye kabhi kabhi jwalak ke chaaron ore dhol jaisaa ek pardaa laga rahata he, jo unchaa yaa nicha kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes a rotating cover is applied
 prachhadanpat ghumaate rahane ke liye bhaar yaa spring se chalanevaala ghadi sareekha ek yantra rahata he, jisamen chalaniamak ke saath saath ek chetavanisanket bhi laga rahata he, jo yathasamay yah bataata he ki ab chaabi dene kii aavashyaktaa he
 Where electricity is available, a small motor is also installed, which automatically gives the key when needed, or keeps turning the lighting device directly
 gas dwaara prakashit aadhunik upkarnon main gas ke dabaav se hi upkaran ke lens ko ghumaane kaa kaam liya jaataa he
 If there are any types of gas flammers, sometimes they are burnt alternately to produce the effect of light and cover
 aadhunik damak jyoti prachhaadan prakaash se acchhee hoti he
 Different types of light which are used nowadays are as follows: sthirdip main jyoti nirantar ek hi prakaar se nikalati dikhaai detii he
 Its use is now limited to small ports and is not equal to modern lighthouses
 isse jahaaj ke prakaash kaa, yaa nearesth tateey prakaash kaa, bhram ho saktaa he
 There are many types of fire light
 ek damak-jyoti mahatvapurn sthanon par lagati he
 The interval between flashes is always greater than the time of flaring
 anek-damak-jyoti main do yaa adhik baar jaldi jaldi damakane ke baad kuch lambey antaraal kaa kram rahata he : jaise aadhe aadhe second kii do, teen, yaa adhik, damaken do do second ke antaraal se hon, phir das second tak andhera rahane kaa kram lagaataar chalata rahe
 In the steady-light-flame, there is a spark between the regular difference between the stationary flame, which is followed by a brief cover behind
 prakaash kii tivrata asmaan honaper yah avishwasaneey ho jaati he
 There is the same flaw in static and many-sparkling light
 prachhaadan jyoti main sthir prakaash ke saath niyamit antaraal par prachhaadan kaa kram rahata he
 The time of light and light can be the same or uneven
 jab prachhaadan do do, yaa adhik baar kaa ho to vah anek prachhaadan-jyoti kehalaati he
 Alternating light is alternately called steady light of two colors
 yadi purvokt kisi prakaar kaa prakaash baari baari se do rangon main hota he, to uske naam ke pehle prayavarti lagane se uskaa bodh hota he
 The reference light is used for reflection in a narrow passage
 iske liye bhramideep kaa prayog nahin hota
 Stabhadeep is suitable for this work, often with cover
 kisi vishesh jalpath main, athwa balua taton ke yaa anya khatarnaak sthanon ke bich, rasta dikhaane ke liye prakaash kii aisi vyavastha rahati he ki khatre par rangeen prakaash pade or shwet prakaash khatre se paryaapt duuri rakhte hue surakshit maarg bataae
 The use of colored light becomes essential for identifying dangerous places anywhere, or for differentiating a variety of signs, otherwise colors are used as little as possible
 kyonki isse prakaash kii tivrata kam ho jaati he
 It is better to run the work of identification with multiple lights
 prayavarti rangon se prakaash kii bhi sifarish nahin kii ja sakati, kyonki vayumandal main rangeen kirnon kaa or rangahin kirnon kaa avasorana bhinn bhinn maatra main hota he
 If necessary, the area of the lens and prism is enlarged for the color spectrum, so that initially their intensity is approximately equal to the intensity of the colorless beam
 kachapatal kaa laal rang bhedane ke baad prakaash kii tivrata keval 40 pratishat hi rah jaati he or haraa rang bhedane par keval 25 prati shat
 Therefore, if it is mandatory to keep colorless light as well as red and green light, then they need to be reinforced

 From a linguistic perspective, they are considered to be members of the afro-asian or Semitic language family
 barbar bhashaaon ke chah pramukh shakhaayen hai - Those who speak the barbaric language of one branch do not fully understand the dialect of any other branch because the words and accents in these branches are different
 barbari kii apni "tifinag" naam kii pracheen aksharmala he jisaki sabase puraani likhaai 200 ipu se mili he
 After the Arabic invasion and occupation of barbaric areas, its use almost ceased, although it continued to be used by the Tuarag-speakers living in the deep desert
 bahut se barbar log barbari chhodkar arabi bolne lage or jo barbari likhte-bolte bhi the unamem arabi varnmaala kaa istemaal aam ho gaya
 Apart from the Tuarg areas, the use of Arabic characters in barbaric areas was prevalent from 1000 AD to 1500 AD
 19ve or 20ve sadi main europian samavaad ke saath -saath barbari kaa roman lipi main likhnaa shuru ho gaya
 This "barbaric Latin alphabet" became widely used in Morocco and Algeria, especially for writing tribal barbarians
 2003 main morocco ne, barbar swabhimaan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, aupchaarik rup se tifinag lipi ke ek aadhunik rup ko sarkari manyata de di lekin abhi bhi kabaili barbar lekhak barbar latin lipi kaa hi zyaada prayog karte hai
 In contrast, Mali and Niger with Turang populations recognized the barbaric Latin script although Tifinag is more prevalent there
 angrezi main sangyaaon kaa ling nahin hota, jabaki hindi main sangyaayen streeling yaa pulling hoti hai 
 Berbari is like Hindi in this case
 pulling sangyaayen 'a / aa', 'u / uu' yaa 'i / i' se shuru hoti hai - There are three methods to make a noun plural - which method is used depends on the noun
 tulana ke liye, hindi main bhi teen tareeqen hai - 'juuta' kaa bahuvachan 'juute', 'makkhi' kaa 'makkhiyaan' or 'fal' kaa 'fal' hi hota he
 The 'normal method' is applied to some nouns of Berbri in which the first vowel of the word is changed to 'n' at the end - kuch sangyaaon par 'tuuti vidhi' lagu hoti he jisamen bahuvachan banane ke liye keval ekvachan shabd ke swaron main pher-badal kiya jaataa he - The third method is the mixed method, which is a mixture of the first two methods - kisi sangya kaa streeling banane ke liye ekvachan main uske pulling rup ke ird-gird 't' laga diya jaataa he or bahuvachan main keval uske shuru main hi 't' laga diya jaataa he - Note that the pronunciation of the letter 'G' used in the words "taimizigt", "tiffinag" and many other Berberies is different from "c"
 yah 'ghazal' ke 'ga' jaisaa he 
 Similarly, the pronunciation of 'kh' is also different from 'kh'

 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them was the ubiquitous ether
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory

 tivi ke istemaal ke armbh se hi is tarah ke vigyapanon kaa istemaal tarah-tarah ke utpaadon, sevaaon or vichaaron ko badhaava dene ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he

 Political advertising on TV is heavily banned in other countries such as France, and in some countries such as Norway, it is completely banned

 The first TV commercial in the UK was broadcast on ITV on 21 September 1955 advertising Gibbs SR toothpaste

 Many TV commercials feature catchy chimes or catchy phrases that create relentless thoughts that can persist in the minds of TV viewers even after the end of the advertising campaign
 in vigyaapan jhankaaron yaa aakarshak vaakyanshon main se kuch kaa unke jivan se grahan kiye hue ho sakate hai jo parihaas yaa "rifs" ko janm dete hai jo filmon, tivi sho, magajeenon, hasya pustakon yaa saahitiv main dikhaai dete hai
 These enduring advertising elements can be said to have carved a niche in the pop culture history of the common people to whom they were presented
 iskaa ek udhaaharan 1950 ke dashak se 1970 ke dashak tak winston cigarets ke liye atharah saal tak chalane vaale vigyaapan abhiyaan kaa sthaayee vaakyansh "winston tests good like e cigarette shud" he
 Even after the end of the advertising campaign, for almost two decades, this fascinating conversation and its direct references continued to appear
 ek or vaakyansh "whalers da bif?" he jo itnaa lokapriy hua ki iskaa istemaal walter mondel ne bhi 1984 ke raashtrapati pad ke chunaav main kar daalaa
 Also another popular catchy phrase is "I have fallen and i can't get up" which is still occasionally seen when it was first used nearly two decades ago

 Advertising agencies often use humor as a medium in their creative marketing campaigns
 vastav main kai manovaigyanik adhyayanon ne hasya ke prabhaavon or shashakt vigyaapan anunay se uske sambandh kaa pradarshan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 Animation is often used in advertisements
 haath se bane paaramparik anemeshan se computer anemeshan kii tasveeron main antar ho saktaa he
 Using animated characters can create some attraction in an advertisement which is difficult to achieve by the performance of artists or only products
 fishan jagat main hone vaale parivartanon se sambandhit vigyapanon main bhi anemeshan safal sabit hue hai
 So animated advertisements can last long enough for several decades in many instances
 ullekhneey udaahranon main kelogs anaajon ke liye vigyapanon kii shrinkhalaa shaamil he jisamen snap, karaikal and pop or tony da tiger ne bhi abhinay kiya he
 Animation also often features real artists
 anemated vigyaapan sthaayee locrpriyata hasil kar sakate hai
 Any popular vote for the most memorable TV commercials in the UK invariably includes animation, such as the classic Smash and Creature Comfort ads, which topped the list
 anya dirghasthayee vigyaapan abhiyaan logon ko aashcharya ke madhyam se yaa darshak ko chakkar main daalkar bhi aakarshith karte hai jaise energaiger banni vigyaapan shrinkhalaa
 isaki shuruyaat 1980 ke dashak ke antim daur main ek saadhaaran tulana vigyaapan ke rup main hui thi jahaan bydaree se chalane vaale khargoshon se bhare ek kamare main unhen apana-apana drum bajaate hue dekha gaya tha jinamein se energaiger bydaree vaale ek khargosh chhodkar baaki sabhi khargosh dhire-dhire dhime padate chale gaye
 Years later, a modified version of this profitable advertisement had an energetic rabbit that continued to cross the steps
 This was followed by another ad: Audiences were unaware that the latter "ad" was actually a copy of other well-known advertisements until the sudden arrival of the Eraser Rabbit where the announcer was saying "still going on" is
 

" 
 yah vigyaapan abhiyaan lagbhag 15 saal tak chalata rahaa
 Others themselves have copied the Energizer Bunny series in motion pictures through a Coors Light Beer ad, and even in the current commercials of Gecko Insurance
 tivi vigyaapan kaaryakramon ke bich main dikhaai dete hai lekin ve antaraalon par bhi unamem hastkshep karte hai
 The purpose of this method of screening advertisements is to attract the attention of viewers who keep the attention of the viewers on the TV program so that they do not wish to change the channel; Instead they will watch the advertisements while waiting for the next segment of the program
 However, remote control now allows viewers to easily "adapt" advertisements, for which all they need to do is to turn off the voice or even change the channel when the advertisement arrives
 iske alaava log kaarykram ke chaalu hone kaa intjaar karte samay vigyapanon ke dauraan duusare kaamon main lag jate hai
 Additionally, with the help of TV recording mechanisms such as dvrs and Tivo, viewers have been able to skip advertising altogether during the TV show
 puraa udyog puri tarah se is kaam par apana najar jamaaye hue hai ki darshakon ke man main vigyapanon ke prati itani ruchi bhar di jaae ki ve vigyapanon kaa besabri se intjaar karne lage
 The Nielsen rating system exists as a way for stations to find out how successful their TV programs are so that they can decide what rate they should charge advertisers for their ads
 kaarykram kaa kuch samay vigyapanon ke prasaaran main chalaa jaataa he
 Commercial brakes have also become longer
 1960 ke dashak main lagbhag ek ghante chalane vaala ek america kaarykram vigyapanon ko chhodkar 51 minute tak chalata tha
 Nowadays a similar program only lasts for 42 minutes; In a 30-minute time segment, the program now receives only 22 minutes, and six minutes are spent in national advertising and two minutes in local advertising
 yahan tak ki kuch network bhi 18 minute vaale ek kaarykram yaa 12 minute vaale ek vigyaapan vibhaajan kaa istemaal karte hai
 For example, the TV broadcast of the 101-minute film The Wizard of Oz in the early to mid-1960s takes two hours with advertisements
 aajkal usee film kaa prasaaran vigyaapan sahit lagbhag do ghante 15 minute tak chalegaa
 In other words, American viewers will watch about three hours of advertising in a 10-hour period, twice that of the 1960s
 iske alaava, agar 1960 ke dashak ke kisi kaarykram aaj phir se chalaaya jaae to atirikt vigyapanon ke liye jagah banane ke liye vishay samagriyon ko sampadit yaa usamen kaant-chhaant kiya ja saktaa he
 In recent years, its length has increased to an average of two minutes
 1950 or 1960 ke dashakon main vigyapanon kii ausat lambaai ek minute thi
 The average length decreased to 30 seconds as the years passed but most of those commercials are now shown during breaks while in the 60s only one or two commercials were shown during each break

 The annual Super Bowl American football game is as famous for its sport as it is for its advertisements and during this game the average cost of only one TV spot lasting 30 seconds has reached US $ 3 million
 aam taur par vigyapandaata 18 se 49 varsh ke logon ko apana nishaanaa bananaa chaahate hai; buudhe darshakon main zyaadaatar vigyapandaataaon kii koi ruchi nahin hoti kyonki ve apane kharidne kii aadaton ko badalanaa nahin chaahate
 lakshyit jansankhya ke bheetar aane vaale darshakon kii sankhya kul darshakon kii tulana main vigyaapan rajasvon ke liye adhik mahatvapurn he
 According to Advertising Age, Grace Anatomy was able to charge $ 419000 for each advertisement during the 2007–08 season, compared to only $ 248,000 for an advertisement during CSI, although seen as nearly five million in CSI
 The audience was high

 Broadcasting networks are concerned with the increased use of dvrs by younger viewers, resulting in a drop in viewership of live viewing and consequently a drop in advertising rates
 iske alaava tivi vigyapandaata kuch aise darshakon kii jansankhya ko bhi apana nishaanaa bana sakate hai jo kisi khaas jati, aay str or ling se sambandhit hon
 haal ke varshon main pataa chalaa he ki kaarykram ke madhyam se nishaanaa banaae jane vaale yuva purushon kii tulana main yuva mahilaon ko apane vigyapanon kaa nishaanaa bananaa vigyapandaataaon ke liye adhik phydemand sabit ho rahaa he jiskaa kaaran yah he ki yuva purush mahilaon kii tulana main kam tivi dekhte hai
 TV advertising in the United Kingdom is considered significantly cheaper than in the United States

 Since a single TV ad can be broadcast multiple times in a row for several weeks, months, and even years), TV ad production studios often spend a lot of money building a single TV spot lasting thirty seconds

 Many TV commercials are so decorated that they can be considered a thirty-second short film; In fact, many film directors also direct TV commercials as a means of gaining exposure and earning money
 film nirdeshak ridley scot ke sabase mashhoor cinemai palon main se ek tivi vigyaapan tha jise unhone aipal macintosh computer ke liye nirdeshit kiya tha jise 1984 main prasaarit kiya gaya tha

 kuch vigyapanon kii lokapriyata ke baavjood kai log unhen kai kaarnon se ek musiibat maanate hai

 The Broadcasting Committee of Advertising practice in the UK also has this rule
 vigyapanon kii badhati sankhya ke saath-saath usee vigyaapan ko jarurat se zyada dikhaanaa pareshaani kaa ek doosraa kaaran he
 a third reason may be that TV is currently the main medium of advertising promoting every advertising campaign, from cell phone companies advertising campaigns, political campaigns, fast food restaurant advertising campaigns to local businesses and small businesses
 Commercial brakes are also getting longer
 ant main ek or kaaran yah he ki vigyapanon kii vajah se aksar niyamit kaaryakramon ke kuch aise hisson main katautee kar di jaati he jo yaa to kathanak kaa antim bhaag yaa kaarykram kaa koi mahatvapurn mode hota he jise dekhnaa kai logon ke liye romaanchak yaa manoranjak hota he
 The main reason why advertisements are annoying for some people from a cognitive point of view is that what is offered in the advertisement is not a topic of interest or beneficial at the time or the presentation is unclear
 ek vishisht darshak itnaa zyada vigyaapan dekh chukaa hota he ki use lagane lagata he ki zyaadaatar vigyaapan kshtprad honge jo darshak ko dukhadaayi rup se apane dekhne vaale kaarykram ko chunane par majaboor karne lagata he
 Conversely, if an advertisement touches the viewer's heart or receives entertainment beyond the basic message, the viewer can wait for that advertisement and may wish to see it again
