 salicylic acid ek halkaa amla he or munh se lene ke baad isaki bahut kam maatra kaa amashay main ynikaran hota he
 Acetyl salicylic acid is much less soluble in the acidic state of the stomach, which can delay the absorption of large doses by 8 to 24 hours
 choti aant ke bade hue piech ke alaava, adhik satahi kshetrafal ke kaaran aspirin vahaan teji se avashoshit hoti he, jisase salicyllette adhik maatra main ghulte hai
 Due to solubility, the absorption of aspirin is very slow when taken in high doses and its concentrations in plasma can increase up to 24 hours after its intake
 rakt main salicyllette kaa lagbhag 50-80% protein se judaa hota he jabaki baaki maatra sakriy, ynikrut sthiti main hoti he
 Protein binding is dependent on the concentration

 glysine se sandhukt hokar salicyloorik acid banataa he or glucuronic acid se sanyukt hokar salissyle acil or phinalik glakuronide banate hai
 These metabolic pathways have limited capacity
 salicylic acid kii laghu matraaen hydraxilit hokar jentisik acid banaati hai
 With large amounts of salicylate the kinetics is displaced from the first position to the void space, as metabolic pathways are saturated and the drainage from the kidneys increases in importance
 salicyllette gurdon dwaara mukhyatah salicyloorik acid, mukt salicylic acid, salicylic phinol or esile glucuronidon va jantisik acid ke rup main nishkasit hote hai
 When taken in small quantities all routes run by first-rate dynamics and the extracted half-life is about 2 to 4

 It was installed in the palace for some time before the Chaturbhuj Temple was built
 lekin mandir banane ke baad koi bhi murti ko uske sthaan se hilaa nahin paaya
 Believing it to be a miracle of God, the palace itself was given the shape of a temple and was named Ram Raja Mandir
 aaj is mahal ke chaaron ore shahar basaa he or ram navami par yahaan hajaaron shraddhalu ikattha hote hai
 By the way, Lord Rama is considered to be Lord here and is also considered the king here, because the face of that idol is not towards the temple but towards the palace

 But this Deity of Rama refused to go to the quadrilateral

 Rama still sits in this palace and the quadrangular temple built for him is deserted even today
 yah mandir aaj bhi murti viheen he
 It is also a coincidence that the writing of Ramcharit Manas was also completed on the same day in 1631, when Ramaraja arrived in Orchha

 zyaadaatar vikaas ke parinamswaroop teji se chote, sasta or adhik shaktishaalee or kushal computing upkarnon kaa avishkar ho paaya he
 In the first generation computers, the vacuum tube was used to make the circuit and the magnetic drums used for memory
 Due to the use of vacuum tube, a lot of heat was emitted from these computers, which was a big problem of these computers
 These computers were able to understand low-level language, so binary language was used to tell them the work, which was very difficult to use
 Because all instructions in binary language are written using 0 and 1, in which mistakes were very difficult to identify
 These computers could do only one thing at a time
 Print out was used on the punch card for input and output
 univek or iniye pratham peedi ke udhaaharan hai These computers were faster than the first generation and used transistors instead of vacuum tubes
 This transistor was invented in 1947, after the use of it, the speed of the computer became faster than before, but these computers also emitted heat
 In this generation of computers also, punch cards were used to give input and print out was used to get the output
 But instead of binary language, assembly language was used to write programs
 In the assembly language, letters of English are used as codes
 COBOL or FORTRAN bhashaao ke praarambhik varjan kaa prayog isi samay kiya jane laga, jo kii ucch stareey bhashaa ke udahaaran he | In this generation, keyboards and monitors were used to provide input, and the first operating system was used in this generation, a cui-based operating system
 In the third generation computer, IC was replaced in place of transistor
 IC was invented in 1958 by Jack Kilby
 Using the IC, the size of the computer was much smaller and faster than before
 In this generation of computers, high level language was used to write programs and these computers were capable of doing more than one task at a time
 CUI- Character User Interface The fourth generation computer started with a microprocessor, a chip made of silicon on which thousands of ics It hangs together
 This generation of computers used a GUI based operating system which was very easy to use
 Ex
- WINDOW GUI- Graphical User Interface Use of mouse started in this generation itself and some high-level languages were developed for writing programs such as c and c ++

 After this incident, Weing ends their relationship there

 is bich, uske saath vishwasghaat karne ke aparaadh main drek aakhri bache simbiot ko scorth par chhod detaa he, jo antat mar jaataa he
 As a result, the symbiote left inside Brock is the only known surviving specimen of its species

 After taking shelter outside the city, the symbiote talks to Brock, and reveals his name as Venom
 yah brock ko yah bhi bataata he ki dhoomaketu ek akraman bal he, jo nai duniya kii talash main he jahaan simbiot nivaasiyon ko pakad kar kha sakate hai
 Venom then offers to leave Brock alive, helping the symbiots achieve this goal, and Brock soon begins to enjoy all the superhuman characteristics he has acquired from the symbiote
 brock drek ke aparaadhon ke sabooton ko badalane ke liye apane puraane kaarysthal main ghus jaataa he, lekin baahar nikalne par vah swat ke adhikariyon se ghir jaataa he, or unase bachane ke liye ek baar phir se venum main badal jaataa he

 drek ke gundon se brock ko chhudaane ke liye veing anichhaa se venum ke saath simbiosis karti he
 When Brock and Venom are reunited, Venom says that the earlier conversation with Brock convinced him to help protect the Earth, and then with the help of both Weing to stop Raitt and Drake
 Let's go out

 Grace's role was initially written for a minor, not to mention her nickname, Venom, but was later changed to a major villain role, as producer Avi Arad felt that spider-man series director Sam Raimi's personal favorites relied more heavily on villains, rather than characters that modern fans were more interested in
 raimi, duusari taraf, charitra kii kathith "maanavtaa kii kami" ke kaaran ise prayog karne main sankoch kar rahe the
 In July 2007, Arad revealed his plans to make a spin-off film centered on Venom

 The studio began with a script by Jacob Estes, but then changed his mind and decided to move the film in a different direction from his draft, and began looking for new writers
 soni ko is baat par bhi sanshay tha ki kya gres akele apane kandhon par ek puri film sambhaal saktaa he
 In September of the same year, Venom co-producer Todd mcfarlane suggested to Sony that the Venom film not be able to perform due to having a villain as the main character
 iske jawaab main soni ne paul varnik or rate reez ko ek nai patakatha likhane ke liye kaam par rakhaa, jabaki udyog ke kai andruni sutron ne soni ko suzav diya ki gres ko hi spin-of ke liye waapas aana chahie
 Wernick and Reese told Sony an origin story for the film, which Reese described as a realistic, straightforward, and slightly blasphemous story to the character
 yugal ne soni or maarval ke saath ek ruparekha par kaam kiya, jinke "khalnaayakon, unki aitihaasik prishthbhumi, or us tarah kii anya chizon ke bare main vishisht niyam the"
 By April 2009 Wernick and Reese had completed a draft, which featured a role written specifically for Stan Lee, and featured a sequence in which the Venom symbiote "jumps from one body to another across the city
" Lives on, and each person inside whom it is going is actually getting violent and attacking another, until it leaves it and moves on
 " He was a journalist
 He had the wrong story, he got in trouble for it 


 the whole essence to us for the Marvel characters: stay close to the bible, stay close to the emotional story, and the rest is fun
 varnik or reez ne sitambar 2009 tak apane duusare masaude ko bhi puraa kar diya tha, or reez ne kaha ki soni "kisi bhi tareeke se aage badhanaa chaah rahi thi"
 a month later, Gary Ross, who was writing the screenplay for spider-man 4 at the time, was tasked with rewriting Venum's screenplay, directing it, and producing alongside Arad
 drawing board se dobaaraa shuru ho rahi is film ke liye gres kaa venum kii bhoomika main lautnaa "sambhavit nahin mana ja rahaa tha", jisamen ab khalanaayak ko ek anti-hero main parivartit kar diya gaya tha, jo nirdosh logon kaa bachaav karata tha
 In January 2010, when Raimi decided not to work on a direct sequel to spider-man 3, Sony also announced that the spider-man franchise would be rebooted
 march 2012 tak, soni abhi bhi ek venum film main ruchi rakhti thi, haalaanki, ab vah apni pehali riboot film, da amazing spidar-main kii relies par puunjikaran kii talash main thi

 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 vaidic samay se hi vishnu sampoorn vishwa kii sarvocch shakti tathaa niyanta ke rup main maanya rahe hai
 Vishnu is one of the three main forms of God in the basic texts of Hinduism, according to the Puranic Purana
 puraanon main trimurti vishnu ko vishwa kaa paalanhaar kaha gaya he
 Brahma and Shiva are considered to be the other two forms of Trimurti
 brahma ko jahaan vishwa kaa srijan karne vaala mana jaataa he, vahiin shiv ko sanhaarak mana gaya he
 Originally Vishnu and Shiva and Brahma are also the same, this belief has also been generally accepted
 nyaay ko prashray, anyaay ke vinaash tathaa jeev ko paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg-grahan ke nirdesh hetu vibhinn roopon main avatar grahan karanevaale ke rup main vishnu maanya rahe hai
 According to the Puranas, Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi

 Vishnu's abode is Kshira Sagar
 unka shayan sheshnag ke upar he
 a lotus is produced from his navel in which Brahma ji is situated
 vah apane neeche vaale baayein haath main padam, apane neeche vaale daahine haath main gada ,upar vaale baayein haath main shankh or apane upar vaale daahine haath main chakra dhaaran karte hai
 The derivation of the word 'vishnu' has been considered mainly from the 'vishu' metal
 nirukt main yaskacharya ne mukhya rup se 'vish' dhaatu ko hi 'vyapti' ke arth main lete hue usase 'vishnu' shabd ko nishpann bataaya he
 Alternatively, 'vishwa Dhatu' is also taken to mean 'entry', 'because it is penetrated everywhere because of being an aspect
 aadi shankaracharya ne bhi apane vishnusahasranam-bhashya main 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth mukhyatah vyapak hi mana he, tathaa uski vyutpatti ke rup main spashtatah likhaa he ki "vyapti arth ke vaachak nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup 'vishnu' banataa he"
 He has also taken the 'vishwa Dhatu' option and wrote that "or the negative form of the 'vishva Dhatu' is Vishnu; as stated in Vishnupurana - 'the power of that Mahatma has entered this whole world
 ; Therefore he is called Vishnu, because ‘vish’ dhatu means to enter ”
 rugveda ke pramukh bhashyakaron ne bhi praayah ek swar se 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth vyapak hi kiya he
 In the interpretation of Vishnusukta, Acharya Sayan describes the meaning of 'vishnu' as pervasive and omnipresent; So Shripad Damodar Satavalekar also takes its meaning related to the generality
 maharishi dayanand saraswati ne bhi 'vishnu' kaa arth anekatra sarvyaapee paramatma kiya he or kai jagah param vidvan ke arth main bhi liya he
 Thus it is clearly reflected that the word 'vishnu' is derived from 'vishu' metal and its meaning is vyapam
 vaidic dev-parampara main sookhton kii sankhyik drushti se vishnu kaa sthaan gaun he kyonki unka stvan maatr 5 sookhton main kiya gaya he; lekin yadi sankhyik drushti se na dekhakar unpar or pahaluon se vichaar kiya jaay to unka mahatva bahut badhkar saamne aata he
 In the Rigveda, he is read with adjectives like 'brihachhirir', Yuvakumar etc
 rugveda main ullikhit vishnu ke swaroop evam vaishishtyon kaa avlokan nimnanki binduon main kiya ja saktaa he :- The unique feature of Vishnu is his three foot-projections, which are mentioned twelve times in the Rigveda
 sambhavtah yah unki sabase badi visheshta he
 His three steps are said to be full of honey, which never diminishes
 unke teen pad-kram itane vistrut hai ki unamem sampoorn lok vidyaman rahete hai 
 'tredha Vichkramanah' also transitions three of its foot projections
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad bhi ukt tathy ke parichaayak hai
 Out of his three rankings supplied with Madhu, two are visible, the third is completely imperceptible
 is tisare sarvocch pad ko pakshiyon kii udaan or martya chakshu ke us paar kaha gaya he
 Yask's predecessor Shakupani considers these three footprints to be the symbols of the Sun's movement in three parts of the Universe - Earth, Space and Duloka
 yask ke hi purvavarti aurnavabh unhen surya ke udai, madhyakash main sthiti tathaa ast kaa vaachi maanate hai
 Tilak Sir considers them as a sign of trifurcation of the year
 yadi dekha jaay to adhikansh vidvan vishnu ko surya-vaachi maan kar udaykaal se madhyahn paryant uskaa ek padprakshep, madhyahn se astkaal paryant dwitiya padprakshep or astkaal se punah agrim udaykaal tak tritiy paad-prakshep sweekaarte hai
 These aforesaid two foot projections have been called visible and the third one is unmarked
 lekin mcdanal sahit anya anek vidwaanon kaa bhi kahana he ki is arth main tisare charan ko 'sarvocch' kaise mana ja saktaa he? isliye ve log purvokt shakpuni kii tarah teen charnon ko saura devtaa ke teenon lokon main se hokar jane ke maarg ko maanate hai
 Supporting the idea of the Sun, mcdanal mentions the operation of his 90 horse by Vishnu, each of which has four names
 is prakaar 4 kii sankhya se gunikrut 90 arthath 360 ashwon ko ve ek saura varsh ke dinon se abhinn maanate hai
 In fact, the two terms of Vishnu are indicated by the control of the whole world and his attainment of the third post i
e
 His Holiness
 swayan rugveda main hi in teen padon kii rahasyatmak vyakhya kii gayi he
 Therefore, considering this verse as knowledgeable, it has been clearly stated in the Rigveda that the ultimate post of Vishnu is known only by the learned people
 vaise to vishnu ko vaani main nivas karne vaala bhi mana jaataa he, kintu unka param priy awaas sthal 'pathah' rugveda main bahucharchit he
 Acharya Sayan considered the term 'giri' to be a courtesy, along with its meaning 'vani', as well as figuratively 'advanced folk like a mountain'
 'giri' ko yadi in donon arthon main sweekrut kar liya jaay to samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 Where Vishnu reaches the third position is his place of residence
 vishnu kaa lok ‘param pad’ he arthath gantavya roopen vah sarvotkrisht lok he
 The specialty of that 'param pad' is that it is highly illuminated
 vahaan anek shringon vaali gaayen sancharan kiya karti hai
 'gavah' is like a courtesy here
 shlesh se uskaa arth ‘gaayen’ karne par vahaan dugdh aadi bhautik pushti kaa prachurya evam ‘kirane’ karne par vahaan prakaash arthath atmik unnati kaa bahulya sahaj hi anumey he
 The 'param Pad' of Vishnu has a permanent emanation of Madhu
 yah ‘madhu’ devataaon ko bhi anandit karanevaala he
 Whatever meaning is given to this elegant verse, but it is a sign of bliss in every situation, for which all the creatures including the deity are also desirous and are also trying
 isliye ukt lok kii prapti kii kaamana sabhi karte hai
 In the same mantra, there are also mentions of virtuous people there, while experiencing fulfillment
 vishnu kii ek pramukh visheshta unka indra se maitribhav he
 Indra's companionship enforces his three footsteps
 indra ke saath milakar vah shambar daitya ke 99 kilon kaa vinaash karte hai
 In the same way, he also helps Indra in the battle with vrittra
 donon ko kahin-kahin ek duusare kii shaktiyon se yukt bhi batalaaya gaya he
 Thus Sompan by Vishnu and three foot projections by Indra are also described
 rugveda, mandal 6, sookt 69 main donon devon kaa yugmaroopen stvan hua he
 Similarly, in the verse 5, Sukta 87 of the Rigveda, he gets his help with Indra's fellow Marudagans
 vish dhaatu se vyutpann vishnu pad kaa shabdic arth ‘vyapak, gatisheel, kriyasheel athwa udhyam-sheel’ hota he
 They are praised by the people due to their force and disorder
 ve anant veeryavale hai
 Due to this quality, he is also considered as ‘vrishna’ symbolically
 apane veery athwa vir karmon ke kaaran ve shatruon ke bhay kaa kaaran hai
 People are afraid of them in the same way as a mountain lion
 ‘parameshwaradbhitih’ aadi shruti-vachanon se saamaanya janon kaa bhi unase bhay karnaa siddh ho jaataa he
 Being afraid of them is not without reason
 ve kutsiton kaa vadh aadi hinsakarm karne vaale hai
 It is important to note here that they kill the snotty violent person
 isliye unke liye kaha gaya he ki ve hatyare nahin hai
 Vishnu is wide-ranging, broad and of unrestrained speed
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad is tathy ke poshak hai
 The meaning of 'uruguay' is not even glorified by Acharya Sayan by 'mahajajans doing Stuyaman' or 'prabhutya Stuyaman'
 da
yadunandan mishra kaa kahana he ki is pad kaa arth ‘visteern gati vaala’ karne ke liye ham is liye aagrahvan hai, kyonki use ‘sabhi lokon main sancharan karne vaala’ kaha gaya he
 Their rankings are so long that they measure the three worlds with their three footprints
 vishnu ke teen pad yadi sristi karte hai, sthaapan karte hai, dhaaran karte hai to vahiin par ashrith janon kaa paalan-poshan bhi kiya karte hai
 People get their bhagya annadi as a prasad of the same three order, so that they experience ultimate fulfillment
 jo log vishnu kii stuti karte hai, unka ve sarvavidh kalyaan karte hai, kyonki unke stavnadi karm se use param sphurti milti he
 In this way, everyone is eager to reach the praise of Lord Vishnu
