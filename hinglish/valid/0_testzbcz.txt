 Important temples from four directions of India come under this sacred circumference
 ye mandiren hai- puri, rameswaram, dwarka or badrinaath in mandiron ko 8veen shadi main aadi shankaracharya ne ek sutara main piroyaa tha
 It is impossible to decide which of these four temples should be given the ultimate place
 lekin in sab main badrinaath sabase zyada mahatvapurn or adhik tirthayatriyon dwaara darshan karne vaala mandir he
 Apart from this, Badrinath is also more important and popular in Chota Char Dham temples situated on the Himalayas
 is chote chaar dham main badrinaath ke alaava kedarnath, yamunotri evam gangotri shamil hai
 These four dhams hold their separate and important place in Hinduism
 beesvin shatabdi ke madhya main himalay kii god main based in chaaron tirthasthalon ko chota' visheshan diya gaya jo aaj bhi yahaan based in devsthanon ko paribhaashit karte hai
 To visit Chhota Char Dham one has to climb to a height of more than 4,000 meters

 Traveling here before 1962 was quite difficult
 parantu china ke saath hue yuddh ke uparaant jyon-jyon sainikon kii awajahi badi vaise hi tirthayatriyon ke liye raste bhi aasaan hote gaye
 Later the word 'chota' was removed to remove any confusion and this journey has come to be known as 'char Dham of Himalayas'
 avaagaman ke saadhan main sudhaar hone ke saath hi bharat ke hindu tirthayatriyon ke liye yah ek pramukh tirthasthal ban gaya he
 Its popularity can be gauged from the annual number of tourists, pilgrims
 uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar prayek yatra kaal main 250,000se zyada tirthayatri yahaan darshan hetu aate hai
 Two months before the arrival of monsoon, there is a tremendous noise of tourists, pilgrims
 barish ke mausam main yahaan janaa khatarnaak mana jaataa he, kyonki is dauraan bhuskhalan kii sambhaavna saamaanya se zyada rahati he
 According to Indian scriptures, Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath are the holiest places of Hindus
 inako chaar dham ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa hai
 It is said in the scriptures that not only the virtues who are able to see here are washed away the sin of this birth, but they are also freed from the bond of life and death
 is sthaan ke sambandh main yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah vahi sthal he jahaan prithvi or swarg ekaakaar hote hai
 Pilgrims first visit Yamunotri and Gangotri during this journey
 yahaan se pavitra jal lekar shraddhalu kedareshwar par jalabhishek karte hai
 The traditional route for these pilgrims is as follows: haridwar - rishikesh - dev prayag - tehri - dharasu - yamunotri - uttarkashi - gangotri - triyuganarayan - gaurikund - kedarnath
 This passage is similar to the sacred circumambulation in traditional Hinduism
 jabaki kedarnath jane ke liye doosraa maarg rishikesh se hote hue devprayag, srinagar, rudraprayag, agastamuni, guptkashi or gaurikund se hokar jaataa he
 Mandakini is the place of origin near Kedarnath

 If you want to make idli on Sunday, then people living in hot state must soak lentils on Saturday, but those living in cold state will have to soak lentils on Friday, because fermentation is late in the cold
 
 urad kii daal or chaaval ko saaf kijiye, dhoiye or alag alag 4 ghante yaa raat bhar ke liye pani main bhigo dijiye
 urad daal se atirikt pani nikaal dijiye or kam pani kaa prayog karte huye ek dam baarik pis lijiye, chaaval se bhi atirikt pani nikaal dijiye or kam pani kaa prayog karte huye thodaa sa motaa pisiye, dono ko milaaiye tathaa itnaa gadha ghol taiyaar kijiye ki chamache se giraane par ek dam dhar ke rup main nahi girnaa chaiye

 Most of the Aroras are Hindus and together with the Khatris they are the main Hindu group in West Pakistan
 inkaa mukhya pesha vyapaar hua karata tha or dakshini-pashchim punjab ke saraiki bhashi samaaj main inkaa kaaphi prabhaav tha
 The livelihood of Arora settled around Chenab was based on agriculture
 haalanki aroda ek ucch jati he lekin use khatri se nicha mana jaataa he
 The two communities are very close to each other and weddings also take place between the two communities
 aroda kaa bhaatia or sood se bhi kareeb kaa rishta he
 Before the partition of India in 1947 and its independence, the Arora community was mainly along the banks of the Indus River and its tributaries in western Punjab; The Malwa region of Indian Punjab, including the border states of the northwest; In the Sindh region; In Rajasthan ; And was inhabited in Gujarat
 punjab ke uttari potohar tathaa maajha kshetron main khatriyon kii sankhya adhik thi
 After independence and partition in India, Aroras mainly live in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Jammu, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and other parts of the country
 vibhaajan ke baad, aroda bharat or pakistan ke kai hisson ke saath puri duniya main chale gaye
 The name Arora is derived from the Arora salt place, which was located near the modern towns of Rohri and Sukkur in Sindh province of Pakistan
 arod rohri ke 8 kilometre purv main sthit he yah sindhu ke tat par sthit he, jahaan se nadi pashchim kii ore ek tej mode leti thi or yah ke vyapaarik centre tathaa ek samrudh shahar tha
 It was the ancient capital of Sindh and its king was Dahir
 varsh 711 main, shahar par arab general mohammad bin kasim ne adhikaar kar liya or isaki rajdhani ko koi 300 kilometre dakshin kii ore haalaa ke nikat mansura le jaaya gaya
 It received another setback in the 10th century when the Indus River changed its course and this was probably due to a major earthquake in the year 962
 sindhu kaa vartmaan maarg arod ke pashchim main he
 The modern towns of Sukkur and Rohri are situated on both sides of the river
 arod ab ek chota sa dhul bharaa shahar he
 The Aroras are divided into three main groups: Uttaradhi, Gujarati and Dakhna
 vibhaajan ke purv 1947 main, ve keval apane samudaay ke bheetar hi vivaah karte the; vibhaajan ke baad unhone anya aroda samudaayon ke saath saath khatriyon, bhaatia tathaa sood samudaayon bich bhi vivaah karne prarambh kar die, par gotra alag hona aavashyak tha
 Prior to the partition of India in 1947, Aroras generally lived in the southwestern parts of Punjab, Dera Ghazi Khan district, Multan, Bahawalpur, North Sindh, and Dera Ismail Khan divisions in the North West Frontier State
 is kshetra kii pramukh bhashaa lhanda he, jise ab pakistan main seraiki naam se janaa jaataa he
 The Aroras settled in different numbers further north, residing in the districts of Zhang, Minwali, Lahore, Amritsar, and Lailpur, as well as Sukkur, Shikarpur district and Karachi south of Derajat
 kohat main, aroda vahaan ke mul nivasee tathaa apravasi arodaaon main bant gaye; adhikansh mul nivasee hindu the jabaki adhikansh apravasi sikh the

 The number of these communities in the 1901 province census was as follows: Arora 653,000; Tradesman 452,000; Khatri 436,000
 bahawalpur ke purv shahi rajya main vyaavhaarik rup se puraa vaanijya aroda logon ke haathon main tha, jabaki patiala main ahaluwalia logon kaa varchasv tha
 Most of the government employees were Aroras
 1901 kii usee janaganana main aroda tathaa khatriyon ke sankhya uttar-pashchim ke seemaant praant main kramshah 69,000 va 34,000 thi; sindh praant tathaa khairpur ke shahi rajya main orada tathaa khatri logon ko lohana ke rup main gina jaataa tha jise sindh kaa vyapaarik samudaay mana jaataa tha
 Many Aroras were promoted in all departments of the Government of India such as Additional Assistant Commissioners, Accountants, Professors, Doctors, Civil Surgeons, Engineers, Military Officers, and Court Officers
 1947 main bharat main vibhaajan ke baad, pakistan ke adhikansh hindu or sikh aroda bharat palaayan kar gaye
 The Aroras joined the rest in India's freedom struggle
 bahut se logon ko satyagrah ke liye kaid kiya gaya
 Some joined the Hindu Mahasabha to fight for freedom, including Madanlal Pahwa
 chunki aroda mukhyatah pashchimi punjab kshetra se hai, isliye inamen se adhikansh ko bharat ke vibhaajan ke samay bharat aana padaa
 The Aroras settled in Amritsar before or even before the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 yah mana jaataa he ki ve sindh yaa multan se aakar lahore main bas gaye or phir uske baad amritsar main
 This conclusion has come from the fact that after staying in central Punjab for a long time, he stopped using his native language Lhanda
 aroda sikh adhiktar bade shaharon main paae jate hai, visheshkar amritsar main
 They were living there before the partition
 unke hindu samakaksh, jiname se adhikansh pakistan se aakar bas gaye the, maatr 100 se 400 mile ki duuri ko tay karne main ek maheene yaa usase bhi adhik samay kii yatra purna karke 1947 main bharat aa gaye, ve bhukh or pyaas se peedit or biimaar the or adhikanshtah unke paas vahi ek maatr vastra tha jise unhone pahana hua tha
 The people of the Arora caste were not only survivors of these crises but they also became more prosperous
 amritsar gazetier yah daawa karata he ki aroda jati ke log bahut urjavan or budhimaan hote hai
 They are mostly engaged in business and industries
 ek hi shahar main based apane samakakshon kii tulana main ve vyapaarik kaushal main utkrisht hai
 Many people of this community are also serving in public and private sectors
 hoshiyapur gazetier kahata he "swatantraaa se purv, shahar main aroda jati ke logon kii sankhya adhik nahin thi
 Along with non-muslim people who came to India from Pakistan in 1947, they also settled here, though they came in small numbers
 adhiktar aroda log pashchimi punjab main or ferozepur nagar main based the
 Their numbers in the eastern cities of Punjab were not significant
 vibhaajan se purv, aroda sirf apni upjati main yaa saamaan bhugolic kshetra ke sadasyon se hi vivaah karte the, arthath, uttaradhi, dakkhan yaa dahra se
 But after the partition, the social scope of marriages of free will extended to other communities of Punjabi origin, especially in the Khatris, Bhatia and Sood communities
 punjabiyon ke anya samudaayon ke saath antarjaatiy vivaah or bharat or vishwa ke anya bhaagon main vivaah karnaa bahut aam baat ho gayi or din pratidin yah baat or bhi saadhaaran hoti ja rahi he
 All these sub-castes also blended so well that they are now referred to as the Punjabi Arora as a whole or simply as the 'punjabi' community
 aroda log, visheshkar bade shaharon main rahane vaale aroda jati ke log or adhik udaaravaadi hote ja rahe hai or isi ke saath varna vyavastha kii adhikadhik avhelnaa kar rahe hai
 Now among Punjabis, the issue of caste which is considered primary in marriage relations has been replaced by socioeconomic prestige
 bharat ke adhikansh aroda hindu hai or sikh sampradaay main ye alpsankhyak samooh ke rup main hai, haalanki sikh samudaay ke andar ve kaaphi prabhaavshaalee maane jate hai
 The people of the Arora caste are very tolerant in terms of their religious beliefs
 iname adhikansh hindu dharm ke anuyaayi hai; haalanki, ve arya samaaj kii pavitrataa kaa bhi aadar karte hai or praayah hi arya samaaj ke mandiron, jain mandiron or sikhon ke gurudware main jate hai
 For the last several centuries, the eldest son of a Hindu Arora family voluntarily converted to Sikhism in the 18th century as a result of family reverence for Sikh Gurus
 dilli, haryana or punjab ke kshetron main adhikansh mandir aroda jati ke niyantran main hai
 In areas where Arora caste has a high population, most of the Shiva temples, Hanuman temple, Sanatan Dharma temple, Durga temple and Krishna temple are managed by the Arora community itself

 sangh ke 34 rajyon main se 23 rajya uttar main sammilit the or desh kii kul jansankhya kaa 2 / 3 bhaag uttar main rahata tha, jisamen daason kii sankhya bahut kam thi
 Industry was predominant in the northern states
 udyogon main sooti, oonee vastra, chamade ke saamaan aadi vasteen bade paimaane par utpaadit hoti thi
 In these factories, labor was produced by machines, so slaves and slaves did not have much importance here
 duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon kaa aarthik jivan krishi par aadhaarit tha or krishi main yantron kaa bahut adhika prayog nahin hota tha
 Hence the peasants of these states depended on the labor of slaves for farming

 Therefore, the society of the south was completely dependent on slaves

 But this step was objected to by the southern states
 kyonki sangrakshan kii niti ke kaaran ab unhen vinirmit vasteen apekshaakrit mahange mulya par milti thi
 Therefore, they felt that the Union was being used for the interests of North America and a view of neglect towards the southern states
 america ke uttari rajyon main daason kii aarthik jivan main koi nirnaayak jivan main koi nirnaayak bhoomika nahin thi
 Therefore, the importance of slaves was secondary to them
 On the other hand, slavery in the southern states of America had dissolved in life

 Now America was expanding into the western regions and new territories were being included in the United States
 aise main yah prashn uth khadaa hua ki in rajyon ko das rajya ke rup main yaa swatantra rajya ke rup main shaamil kiya jaae
 This issue was also important because in the constitution it was accepted that slaves were also counted in the federal administration, but the population of slaves was represented at an average of 3 / 5 ie if the population of slaves would be 500 then consider it 300 Representation began to be given

 On the other hand, the province of East Bengal was named East Pakistan, with its capital at Dhaka
 sangheey rajdhani ko varsh 1959 main karanchi se rawalpindi sthanantarit kiya gaya, jahaan sena mukhyalay tha, or nai rajdhani, islamabad ke puraa hone tak yahaan maujuud rahaa jabaki sangheey vidhanpalika ko dhaka main sthapit kiya gaya
 The aim of this policy was to bring about clear administrative reforms but in many respects it was a very destructive step

 The circulatory system in plants means the transfer of substances absorbed or produced by a plant to all other parts of the plant
 paudhon main jal or khanijon ko uske anya hisson main tak pahunchane kii jarurat padati he
 Plants also need to transport food made in leaves to other parts of the plant
 paudhe shakhayukta hote hai, taaki unhen prakashasanshleshan hetu carbon dioxide or oxigen prasaran ke madhyam se hawa se sidhe mil saken
 Plants require minerals to produce water and proteins to produce food through photosynthesis
 isliye, paudhe apni jadon ke madhyam se jal or khanij ko avashoshit karte hai or paudhe ke tane, pattiyon, phulon aadi anya hisson main ise pahunchaate hai
 Water and minerals are transported from the roots of the plant to its leaves only through two types of elements of xylem tissue, ie xylem vessels and ducts
 jilam vahikaaye ek lambii nalee hoti hai, jo antim siron par judi hui mrit koshikaon se milakar bani hoti hai
 It is a lifeless tube that travels from the roots of the plant to every stem and leaf
 koshikaon kii antim sire toote hue hote hai, taaki ek khuli hui nalee ban sake
 Xylem vessels do not have cytoplasm or nucleus, and the walls of the vessels are composed of cellulose or lignin
 jal or khanijon ke parisancharan ke atirikt jilam vahikaaye tane ko majbootee pradaan kar use upar kii ore banaae rakhti hai
 This is because lignin is very hard and strong
 lakdi lignin yukt jilam vahikaaon se hi banati he
 The xylem vessels have pits in the cell wall where lignin cannot accumulate
 yaa to jilam vahikaaye yaa phir jilam vahikaaye or vahinikaaye donon, pushpiya paudhon main jal kaa parisancharan karti hai
 In plants with no flowers, only the ducts are the tissues that circulate water
 vahinikaaye mrit koshikaayen hoti hai,or isaki bhitti lignin yukt hoti hai or isamen khule hue sire nahin paye jate hai
 These are long, thin and fibrous cells
 inamen gaddhe paye jate hai jinke jariye hi ek vahinika se duusare vahinika main pani kaa parisancharan hota he
 Ducts are found in all plants
 ==ek paudhe main jal or khanijon parisancharan prakriya ko samajhane se pehlenimnlikhit mahatvapurn shabdon kworth jaananaa aavashyak he== The outer layer of plant root cells is called the epidermis
 bahyatvchaaki motaai ek koshika ke baraabar hoti he
 The layer of cells present around the convection tissues of a plant is called intracellular
 yah cortex kii sabase bhitari parat hoti he
 It is the part found in the root between the epidermis and the dermis
 jadiy / root jilmah yah jadon main upasthit jilam utak he, joki jad ke centre main upasthit hota he
 The epidermis is located between the root cortex and the root follicles and the root xylem
 isliye, jadon ke rome dwaara mitti se avashoshit jal sabase pehle bahyatvacha, rute cortex or antahtvachaa se hokar gujarata he or phir ant main root jilam main pahunchataa he
 In addition, minerals are also found in the soil
 paudhe mitti se in khanijon ko acarbonic, jaise-nitrate or phosphate, ke rup main lete hai
 Minerals from the soil dissolve in water to form aqueous solution
 isliye jab jal jadon se pattiyon tak le jaaya jaataa he,to khanij bhi pani main ghul jate hai or ve bhi jal ke saath pattiyon tak pahunch jate hai
 The root follicles absorb the dissolved water from the soil
 jadon ke rome mitti ke kanon ke bich maujuud jal kii parat ke saath sidhe sampark main hota he
 Mineral-rich water enters the root follicles and through the process of osmosis reaches the cells through the cells, the root cortex and the dermis and the root xylem
 paudhe ke jad kii jilam vahikaaye tane kii jilam vahikaaon se judi hoti he
 Therefore, water from the root's xylem vessels travels to the xylem vessels of the stem and then passes through the stalk of the plant to the leaves of the plant
 prakashasanshleshan kriya main paudhe sirf ek se do pratishat pani kaa hi prayog karte hai, baaki jal jalawaashp ke rup main vaayu main shaamil ho jaataa he
 Xylem vessels absorb water, the pressure at the top of the plant is low, while the pressure at the bottom of the plant is high
 paudhe ke sheersh par dabaav ke kam hone kii vajah vashpotsargan he
 As the pressure at the top of the plant is low, water is transmitted from the xylem vessels to the leaves of the plant
 paudhe kii pattiyon se hone vaala vashpikaran ‘vashpotsargan’ kehalaata he
 There are small holes on the leaves of the plant, which are called 'stomata'
 iske madhyam se hi jal vaashp ban kar vaayu main chalaa jaataa he
 This reduces the pressure of the top of the xylem vessels and the water is transmitted to it
 bhojan or anya padaarthon kaa parivahanprakashasanshleshan kii prakriya main ek paudhe kii pattiyon main taiyaar hone vaala bhojan uske anya hisson jaise tanon, jadon, shakhaon aadi main pahunchaaya jaataa he
 This food reaches different parts of plants through a type of tube, this tube is called phloem
 paudhe kii pattiyon se bhojan kaa paudhe ke anya hisson main bheja janaa ‘sthaanantaran’ kehalaata he
 The food made by the leaves is in the form of simple sugars
 floem paudhe ke sabhi hisson main maujuud hota he
 The sieve ducts are found in the phloem
 The phloem is a long tube
 kai jivit koshikaayen antim siron par ek duusare se judakar inkaa nirmaan karti hai
 The living cells of phloem are called 'sieve tubes'
 floem main koshikaon kii antim bhitti par chaalani pattiyaan paayi jaati hai, jinamein chote–chote chhidr bane hote hai
 Food is transmitted through these holes through the phloem duct
 chaalani nalikaaon main cytoplasm to hota he, lekin koi cendrak nahin hota he
 Another cell is found with each sieve tube cell, with the nucleus and several other cells present
 chaalani nalikaaon kii koshika bhitti main celulos hota he, lekin lignin nahin paaya jaataa he
 == The process of food circulation in plants == The food produced in the leaves of plants using the energy from ATP enters the sieve tubes of phloem tissue
 uske baad paraasaran kii prakriya dwaara sharkara yukt jal chaalani nalika main pravesh karata he
 This increases the pressure in phloem tissue
 floem utak main bana ucch dabaav paudhe ke nimna dabaav vaale anya sabhi hisson main bhojan pahunchane kaa kaam karata he
 Thus food is transported to all parts of the plant through phloem tissue

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga ashok sundari yah ek hindu devkanya hai, jinka varnan bhagwaan shiv or parvati kii beti ke rup main kiya gaya he
 She is not generally mentioned in the main scriptures as the daughter of Shiva, her legend is inscribed in the Padmapurana
 mata parvati ke akelepan ko dur karne hetu kalpavriksha naamak ped ke dwaara hi ashok sundari kii rachana hui thi
 a + mourning means happiness, she was created only to please Mother Parvati and she was very beautiful and that is why she was called Sundari
 ashok sundari ke janm kii katha padam puraana main bataai gai he jo nahush naamak raja ke charitra varnan kii ikai he
 Once, Lord Shiva took Parvati to Nandanvan on request of Mata Parvati to bring the most beautiful garden in the world, there Mata was fond of Kalpavriksha and took that tree
 kalpavriksha manokamana purna karne vaala vriksh he, parvati nen apane akelepan ko dur karne hetu us vriksh se yah var maanga ki unhe ek kanya praapt ho, tab kalpavriksha dwaara ashok sundari kaa janm hua
 Mata Parvati gave a boon to the girl that she would be married to a man as powerful as Devraj Indra
 ek baar ashok sundari apane daasiyon ke sang nandanvan main vicharan kar raheen thim tabhi vahaan hund naamak rakshas kaa pravesh hua jo ashok sundari ke sundarataa se mohit ho gaya tathaa vivaah kaa prastaav kiya, tab us kanya ne bhavishya main uske purvaniyat vivaah ke sandarbh main bataaya
 The demon said that he would kill the man, then Ashok Sundari cursed the demon that he would die at the hands of the man
 us rakshas nen nahush kaa apharan kar liya jisase nahush ko hund kii ek daasi ne bachaaya
 The man grew up in Maharishi Vashistha's ashram and went ahead and killed Hund
 baad main nahush tathaa ashok sundari kaa vivaah hua tathaa vah yayati jaise vir putr tathaa sau rupavati kanyaon kii mata baniin
 In the absence of Indra, not only man was temporarily made Indra, due to his pride he was cursed and this led to his downfall

 pandav mahabharat ke mukhya paatr hai
 The Pandavas had five brothers - Yudhishthira, Bhimsen, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva
 pandavon ke pita kaa naam pandu tha
 He was a great Kuruvanshi king! Pandu had two wives - Kunti and Madri
 yudhisthir, bhim tathaa arjuna kii mata kunti thi or nakul evam sahadev maadri ke putr the
 Once King Pandu along with his two wives - Kunti and Madri - went to the forest for hunting
 vahaan unhen ek mrug kaa maithunarat joda drushtigat hua
 Pandu immediately wounded the deer with his arrow
 marate huye mrug ne pandu ko shaap diya, "rajan! tumhaare samaan krur purush is sansar main koi bhi nahin hoga
 You have shot me at the time of sexual intercourse, so whenever you become pregnant, you will die
 " Pandu was deeply saddened by this curse and said to his queens, "ladies! Now i will give up all my lusts and stay in this forest, you go back to Hastinapur
" After listening to their words, both queens grieved and said, " Nath! We cannot live for a single moment without you
 aap hamen bhi van main apane saath rakhane kii krupa kijiye
 "pandu accepted his request and allowed him to live with him in the forest
 isi dauraan raja pandu ne amavasya ke din rishi-muniyon ko brahma ji ke darshanon ke liye jate huye dekha
 He urged those sages and sages to take themselves along
 unke is aagrah par rishi-muniyon ne kaha, "rajan! koi bhi nihsantaan purush brahmalok jane kaa adhikari nahin ho saktaa atah ham aapako apane saath le jane main asamarth hai
 " rishi-muniyon kii baat sun kar pandu apni patni se bole, "he kunti! meraa janm lenaa hi vrutha ho rahaa he kyonki santanheen vyakti pitru-rin, rishi-rin, dev-rin tathaa manushya-rin se mukti nahin paa saktaa kya tum putr prapti ke liye meri sahaayta kar sakati ho?" kunti boli, "he aryaputra! durvasa rishi ne mujhe aisa mantra pradaan kiya he jisase main kisi bhi devtaa kaa aahvaan karke manovanchit vastu praapt kar sakati hoon
 You command which god i should call
 " is par pandu ne dharm ko aamantrit karne kaa aadesh diya
 Dharma gave Kunti a son named Yudhishthira

 There are many types of transformers, from the point of view of work, from the point of view of the core and from the size-type, but depending on the design, they can be divided into three categories - croadwale parinamitra - iskaa crode nirantar chumbakeey path kaa hota he
 Primary and secondary coils are located in different segments of the core
 kabhi-kabhi praathmik or dwitiyak ghatak ek ytaakar crode ke bhinn bhinn parshvon par hote hai
 Armored Transformers - These are different from core transformers
 inamen kundaliyaan kisi padaarth ke kendriya bhaag main sthit hoti hai or chumbakeey paripath do yaa adhik pathon main puraa hota he
 Strength transformers are made of both core and armor
 khule croadwale parinamitra - praathmik or dwitiyak kundaliyaan kisi sidhe crode par kundalit or sankendri rup se sthit hoti hai
 They are made in small sizes
 inkaa upyog kuch telephoni upskaron main hota he
 Those transformers are called power transformers whose main purpose is to transfer the electric power from primary winding to secondary winding
 vaise to sabhi transformaron main kuch na kuch vidyut shakti primary se secondari kundaliyon main transfar hoti he kintu shakti transformaron main hastantarit shakti kii maatra apekshaakrit bahut adhik hoti he
 Power transformers also reduce or exceed the voltage
 iske alaava primary or secondari main pruthakkaran bhi pradaan karte he
 Some examples of power transformers are- in transformaron kaa upyog dhara, voltata yaa shakti ke maapan tathaa unki maan nirdhaarit maan se adhik hone par paripath ko band karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 a pulse transformer is a transformer designed specifically to transmit rectangular electric pulses
 in palson kaa rij time or phal time kam hota he tathaa aayam lagbhag niyat hota he
 a good pulse transformer is one that can deliver such moments to the secondary winding with minimal changes
 arthath dwitiyak vinding main praapt pulse kaa rij or phal-time kam hona chaiye or aayam main 'drup' nahin aana chaiye 
 In this, the alternating current is concluded by a single coil
 at: iskaa naam swaprinamitra he
 Its function is similar to that of transmission potentials
 prayukt praathmik voltata ko puri kundali main viksit hone kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 a terminal is common in investment and output
 ek sansparsh bindu ko kundali ke saath sarkaakar nirgat voltata kaa parivartan kiya jaataa he
 From this, the input voltage can be obtained from zero to several times adjustable, alternating voltage
 iskaa upyog prayogshaalaon tathaa udyogon main vyapak rup se hota he
 These transformers provide stable voltages, even though the variance of the input voltages varies between wide ranges
 yah swaniyantran praathmik or dwitiyak donon paripathon main ek bahugun kundalan se hota he
 One of the secondary coils is made resonant by connecting its capacitor across
 dwitiyak ke is bhaag or dwitiyak kundali ke avshisht bhaag main voltata main 180 degree kaa kalantar hota he
 Therefore, the resulting voltage across the entire secondary coil remains constant
 iske atirikt ucch chumbakeey flux ghanata swat: kshatipuran main sahaayak hota he
 When the primary voltage varies from 95 to 135 volts, the secondary voltage varies only by percentage
 lod ke maanon main parivartan is seemaa main koi parivartan nahin karata
 Commercial stationary-voltage transformers are available and widely used in laboratories and industries
 inamen praathmik or dwitiyak ke bich kii duuri ko kisi upyogi yukti se banaae rakhte hai
 This produces a steady current, which is not affected by the changes in input voltage
 shakti parinamitra sthir aavriti par kriyaakaari hote hai or inkaa upyog aavriti ke parivartan kii sthiti main nahin ho saktaa
 Communication engineering uses transformers that, when supported by a complex and variable current stream, can work efficiently over a wide range of frequencies
 iske anek upyog radio-telephoni, radio telegraphy, radio-abhigrahitr or anek electroni paripathon main hote hai
