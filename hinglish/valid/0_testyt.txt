 a review of the powers of knowledge is presented in this philosophy
 saath hi, 17veen or 18veen shatabdiyon ke indriyavaad evam buddhivaad kii samiksha he
 Kant agreed with the sensualists in the acceptance of the secondaryity of the Idris in the acquisition of material; He agreed with the intelligentsia in supporting the imperative of intelligence in converting the said material into ideas; But he did not agree with anyone in resolving one and supporting the other
 kaant ke mat main buddhi or indriyaan gyaan sambandhi do bhinn santhaan nahin hai, balki ek hi sasthan ke do vibhinn avyav hai
 To refer to Kant's philosophy as "altruism" is to regard it as "on" from sensualism and rationalism, and as the basis for every philosophical discourse
 uske darshan main buddhi dwaara gyey vishyon kaa nahin, swayan buddhi kaa pareekshan kiya gaya he or bahut hi vishad rup main
 In the detailed history of European philosophy, for the first and last time, through Kant, the Enlightenments have presented themselves in such detail

 He had said: "know yourself", but after that all the efforts made to know yourself were spent in knowledge of other things beyond themselves

 However, no thinker researched the Enlightenment "I", or the complex institution of intelligence

 European thinkers were supporting the monopoly of the intellect or senses over the kingdom of knowledge by dividing it into two groups under these two influences

 However, seeing the plight of the era, thinker David Hume, a Scottish skeptic, then asked, where is the basis for supporting causality? In the web of events, there is nothing more obvious than just past relationship, co-ordination etc
 is baar, kaant kii pratibha jaagi or usne buddhi kaa pareekshan prarambh kiya
 From 1770 AD to 1781 AD, he contemplated the works of pure intelligence, declaring through the "critique der Reinen Vernunfut" that pure intellect synthesizes the senses
 isiilie prayek vaigyanik nirnay kaa sookshm vishleshan karne par bauddhik karne evam andrik do prakaar ke tatv uplabdh hote hai
 In the first part of the said review, he distinguished the material brought from the external world by the senses and the nature of its perception, while discussing the sensory perception
 usne bataaya ki bahya vastuen indriyon par jo prabhaav daalati hai, vah desh or kaal ke parichchhedon se mukt hota he, kintu, andrik bodh in parichchhedon ke bina sambhav nahin
 Thus he decided that these are two forms of realization, which each bodhasamagri has to accept as soon as it enters the senses
 kaant ne desh or kaal ko avaantar aakaar sthir karte hue, prahanubhaveey tatv kaha
 After so much transformation in the material from external world, the second department of intelligence, the Department of Economics starts its work
 is vibhaag ke kaaryon kaa vivechan buddhisamiksha ke duusare bhaag, "par vishleshan" main kiya gaya he
 He charges 12 titles to the country and material containing knowledge
 kaant ne arthbodh kii 12 oopaadhiyon ko chaar samoohon main vibhajit kiya
 The titles of unity, multiplicity and macroeconomics are quantifiable; The titles of power, prohibition and delimitation are qualitative; The prevalence-overwork, causality dependence and collectivity are relational; Probability impossibility, existential non-existence, inevitability, contingency make sense of type
 uparyukt 12 oopaadhiyon ke aarope ke falswaroop 12 prakaar ke bauddhik nirnay uplabdh hote hai– saamaanya, vishisht tathaa ekbodhak pariman sambandhi nirnay hai, sweekrutibodhak, nishedhbodhak tathaa aseemtabodhak nirnay gunbodh karaate hai; nirpeksh, saapeksh tathaa vaikalpik sambandh bodh karaate hai samasyamoolak, varnanaatmak tathaa ndehsuchak nirnay prakaarta kaa bodh karaate hai
 In this way, Kant established that in acquiring knowledge of the external world, the intellect transforms the material so much that after entering the senses the world does not remain the same as before
 atevam, use buddhigat vastu or bahya vastu main bhed karnaa padaa
 He called the term "nomena" of the object liberated from the discipline of the intellect and "phenomena" of the stuffed object in the said discipline
 is antar kaa taatpary yah dikhaanaa tha ki bauddhik roopaantar ke pashchaat satya gyey vastu praatibhasik ho jaati he
 Now in the third part, which he titled "parapsychology", he revealed that in the absence of the co-operation of the senses, a pure intellect without means is unable to gain knowledge of God, soul and cosmopolitanism
 kintu, kaant kaa uddeshy buddhi ko ukt vishyon ke gyaan main aksham siddh kar "agyanavaad" kaa pravartan karnaa nahin tha
 Therefore, Kant spent seven years tirelessly pondering the final decision to review his pure intellect
 ant main use buddhi ke aage badhane kaa maarg dikhaai diya
 As a result, in 1788 AD, he published the second review book
 yah "vyaavhaarik buddhi kii samiksha" thi
 Seven years ago, pure intellect entered into the inaccessible fields of soul, divine and cosmopolitan, by practical wisdom, with a path of moral experience
 kaant kii vyaavhaarik buddhi shuddh buddhi kii bhanti bahya prakruti ke tathaa apane swabhaav ke niyamon se simit na thi
 He was the intellect of an independent intellectual who was capable of self-regulation
 iskaa taatpary yah nahin ki vyaavhaarik buddhi ke siddhant se kaant habz ke vyaktvaad kaa samarthan karnaa chahta tha
 He had given freedom of self-government to practical intelligence, but according to such rules, which the world should be fair to human beings
 kaant ke darshan ke is str ko samajhane ke liye ek ore parmarth or vyavhaar kaa bhed samajhane kii or duusari ore saidhantik or naitik buddhi ke bhed ko samajhane kii aavashyaktaa he
 He considered altruism to be "on" the periphery of cognitive trade, which is why the review of theoretical thinking, which is true, results in "behavior", which is phenomenological
 kintu, uski drushti main naitik chintan saidhantik chintan se doorgaami he; kyonki vah saidhantik pratibandhon se mukt he
 Therefore, ethical thinking can reach subjects that are relevant to theoretical thinking
 kaant jise vyaavhaarik buddhi kahata he, sachmuch vah naitik buddhi he, bauddhik maanav kii swatantra sankalp shakti he
 In this context, Kant re-established the immortality of the soul and the existence of God
 saidhantik chintan in astitvon ke bina bhi apana kaam chalaa saktaa he, kintu inaki kalpana ke bina naitik chintan ke pair nahin jam sakate
 In the acceptance of the immortal soul is the acceptance of eternal life; Acceptance of God is acceptance of the performer
 inkaa saidhantik mulya bhale hi kuch na ho, kintu naitik mulya bahut bada he
 In moral thinking, the task of the intellect is to consider the problem of conduct
 isiilie kaant ne ise vyaavhaarik buddhi kaha tha
 But he was not supporting many intellectuals
 vah dikhaanaa chahta tha ki vishaybhed se buddhi bhinn roopon main viksit hoti he, bhinn niyamon ke anusaar kaary karti he
 In the scientific interpretation of nature, she expects co-operation of the senses and uses her 14 rules
 vahaan vah kisi aisi satta kaa samarthan nahin karti, jo uske 14 anubandhon ke anushaasan main na aa sake
 She takes the form of sankalpa as soon as instincts in moral thinking and believes in the truths that nourish karma
 kaant kii teesri samasya "sundar" ke aswaad main pravrutt buddhi kii gatividhi ke nirupan kii thi
 He undertook a "review of the decision" to do the work
 iske prakaash main aane kaa samay 1790 i
 tha
 According to Kant, the intellect takes the form of "judgment" as it is oriented towards "beautiful"
 vah "nirnay" ko shuddh buddhi or vyaavhaarik buddhi ke bich kii kadi maanata tha
 He held nature to be a matter of pure intellect and revealed the truth of nature and the research purpose of inevitability
 vyaavhaarik buddhi athwa sankalp kaa vishay "shubh" tathaa uddeshy swatantraaa kaa anubhav tha
 Now he describes the subject of the decision as 'rasnubhuti' and considers this realization as a state between inevitability and independence
 spashtat: nirnay main vah yatharth or adarsh kaa gathbandhan karana chahta tha
 To understand his idea, we have to put the beautiful imagination between knowledge and will
 vah "sudanr" ko gyaan maatr kii vastu nahin, sukhad vastu maanata tha, kintu us sukh ko jo "sudanr" ke prekshan se utpann hota he vah sansargavarjit maanata tha
 He has denied the inclusion and relation of quality, quantity and variety in the definition of "beautiful"
 is prakaar kii rasanubhuti shuddh buddhi tathaa naitik aacharan ke bina sambhav nahin
 Therefore, he calls the imagination of "beautiful" the decision between knowledge and will
 kaant kii is sarvangin samiksha kaa uttarvarti vichaardhaaraon par jitna prabhaav padaa utana kisi aadhunik mat kaa nahin
 His idea of independence influenced Ficte, Schelling and Hegel
 kaant ke gyey or gyaat vastu ke swibhavbhed ne shopenhaar ko prabhavit kiya
 Loz's purposeful suffixism was the fruit of Kant's philosophy

 The criticism methods of Cohen, Natrop, Rickert, Husserl, Heidegger, Cassirer are based on Kant's own indications

 The Rosetta antibody is a novel antibody prediction server with FV / FV region structure, which incorporates modern techniques such as homology models to reduce CDR / CDR rings and increase the orientation of light and heavy chains, which successful docking with specific antigens of antibodies Let's guess
 "antibody" shabd kaa ullekh sabase pehle paul iharlish ke lekh main miltaa he
 The term anticorper appears at the end of his article "experimental Studies on Immunity" published in October 1891, stating that "if two substances promote two different anticorpers, they must be mutually distinct"
 

 However, the term was not immediately accepted and several other terms for antibodies were proposed, including immunocorpor, embosser, Vishencorp, all
 Tans included words such Sensibilisetris, Kopula, Desmon, Filosaites, Fiksecr and Imyunijhm
 antibody shabd aupchaarik rup se antitoxin shabd ke samaan he or isaki avadharana immunecorper ke samaan he
 The study of antibodies began in 1890, when Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato described the process of antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus toxin
 behring or kitasato ne yah kah kar shaareerik pratiraksha kaa siddhant pesh kiya ki serum main madhyasth bahya pratijanon ke saath pratikriya kar sakate hai
 His idea inspired Paul Ihrlish to introduce the side chain theory for antibodies and antigens in 1897, when he hypothesized that receptors on the surface of cells, in particular in a way, toxins by "lock-and-key" action Could bind - and this binding action was the main reason for the production of antibodies
 anya shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa tha ki pratipind rakt main swatantra rup se paae jate hai or 1904 main, elmroth rhite ne bataaya ki ghulansheel pratipind ne bacteria ko 2}phagocitosis tathaa maarane ke liye lepit kiya tha; ek prakriya jise unhonen osponinigeshan kaa naam diya
 In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery found that antigens could be separated by antibodies and showed that antibodies were made of proteins
 1930 ke dashak ke ant main jon marraa dwaara pratijan -pratipind prakriyaaon ke jaev rasinic gunon kaa gahan nirikshan kiya gaya
 The next major achievement came in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ihrlich by showing that the mutual processes of antibodies and antigens depended more on their size than on their chemical structure
 1948 main, astrid fegareos ne paaya ki plavika koshikaon ke rup main bi koshikaayen pratipind utpann karne ke liye jimmedaar thim
 Further work focused on the characteristics of the structures of antibody proteins
 a major achievement in these structural studies was the discovery of antagonistic light chains by Gerald Edleman and Joseph Galli in the early 1960s and their belief that this protein was similar to the bens-jones protein described in 1845 by Henry Bence Jones
 edalman ne khoj kii ki antibody dicelphide bandhan se judy baari tathaa halki shrinkhalaaon se bane hai
 Around the same time, Rodney Porter described the antibody binding and antibody tail regions of igg

 There was a lot of trouble with the size of these computers
 or bhi badi mushkil yah thi ki har computer par ek alag oparating system hota tha
 Software was often formidable and the software running on one system did not necessarily run on another
 yani ki ek tantra par kaam karne kaa yah matlab katai nahin tha ki aap baaqi par bhi kaam kar paayenge
 This was a headache for both users and managers
 tab computer kaafii mahange bhi the or mul karidaari kar lene ke baad usapar kaam karnaa seekhney ke liye achche-kaase tyaag kii zaroorat hoti thi

 1969 main bel labs kii prayogshaala main developers ke ek dal ne software kii aapasi samvadaheenata ke masale par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 He created a new operating system which: bel rlabs ke developers ne is project ko 'unix' kahkar pukaara
 Its code-copying system was important because until then, all commercial operating systems were written in specific code only
 duusari ore unix ko us khaas code ke ek chote se dukade kii zaroorat hati thi, jise aajkal saamanyat: karnel kehete hai
 This kernel, which became the basis of Unix, could be installed in every computer system with slight modifications
 prachaalan tantra sahit sari kaary-pranaliyaan viksit programing bhashaa yani ki 'si' main likhit is karnel ke ird-gird buni gai thim
 This language was specifically designed to build the Unix system
 is nai takanic kaa istemaal karke vibhinn tarah ke hardware par chalanevaale prachaalan tantra kaa vikaas karnaa zayaada aasaan ho gaya
 The software vendors adopted it immediately, as they were now in a position to sell ten times more comfortably

 Unix continued to develop throughout the next two decades
 bahut sari chize sambhav hoti chali gayi or software vikritaon ne apane utpaadon main yanix ke liye nai chizein jodin
 Initially, Unix looked like a giant environment with a mainframe and a mini-computer
 unix ko haath lagane kaa mauqaa kisi vishvavidhyalay yaa kisi bade vyavsaayik gharaane main kaam karanevaalon ko hi mil paata tha
 But small computers were also being built and by the late 80s many people had home computers
 us samay tak pisi ke liye vaise to unix ke kai sanskaran maujuud the, lekin unamem se koi bhi mukt nahin tha
 Linus and linux helsinki vishvavidhyalay main computer kii padhai kar rahe linas torwald ko laga ki unix kaa ek mukt kaa academik sanskaran hona chahie ore usne foran code likhane shuru kar die
 He started asking helpful questions and finding solutions in the jugaad of putting Unix on his personal computer

40 and a posix-questionmessage-id: Date: 3 Jul 91 10:00:50 gmthello netlanders,due to a project I'm working on, I'm interested in the posixstandard definition
 Could somebody please point me to a machine-readable format of the latest posix rules? Ftp-sites would benice
 If you can give the address of the Posix manual, please
 agar afatipi site mil jaaen to kya kehane!)--- From the beginning, Linus intended to have a free system that suited the original Unix
 isiilie usne posix standard kii maang kii kyonki posix unix kaa standard tha
 Plug-and-play was not invented until then
 lekin nijee unix kii betarah badhati maang ke aage yah ek maamuli-si baadha thi
 New drivers were constantly and rapidly building new hardware
 jaise hi koi nayaa hardware bazaar main aata koi na koi use kareed karke uski 'linas-test' karata
 In this way a large amount of free code was launched for the increasing number of hardware
 in coderon ke vyapaar nijee computaron tak simit nahin rahe balki linaks ke liye jo bhi upadey hota ve un sabake liye code likhte rahe
 At that time these people were called "nerds" or "freaks", but this did not make any difference to them as the list of supported hardware was getting longer
 inhen logon ke prayaason kaa fal he ki aaj linaks na sirf pisi ke liye adarsh tantra ban gaya he, balki agar linaks nahin hota to bahut puraane or bade pyaare hardware itihaas ke koodaydaan main samaa jate
 Two years after Linus' mentioned letter, there were 12000 Linux users
 shuru main yah project shaukia shagal tha par kramash: failata gaya, bhale hi posix standard kii paridhi main hi
 All the features of Unix were added in the next two years and by then it became an existing adult version of Linux
 ab linaks puri tarah unix kii aisi nakal he jo har tarah ke computer or ucch-kshamta vaale sarwar par kaam karne main sakasham he
 All companies that make hardware and software have their own Linux developers, you can buy pre-installed and company-supported Linux machines from your local vendor

 History karl won Auer Welsbach, 1885 main presiodemium ke avishkaarak
 In 1839 an oxide from a mixture of crude oil Mosander cerium nitrate, he called "lantana", was extracted which was the oxide of the recently discovered element lanthanum
 1841 main, Mosander dikhaane ke liye ki "lantana" tha sabase joardaar durlabh prithvi tatv oxide kaa ek mishran ke mul par chalaa gaya or pichley acid samaadhaan se upji ho saktaa he jab aadhaar jod diya gaya, yaa pehle bhang ho gaya tha jab mishrit oxide tanu amla ke saath leached the
 The remaining less basic rare earth pink color is retained, and Mosander this remaining fraction is called "didymium"
 1874 main, prati Teodor clive nishkarsh nikaala he ki tathy yah he dydemium do tatwon main tha, or 1879 main, Lecoq di Boisbaudran nai prithvi pruthak, samarium, "dydemium" khanij samarskite se praapt se
 The raw didymium actually contained three elements, and in 1885 Austrian chemist Baron Karl von Auer Welsbach separated it into two elements, praseodymium and neodymium, which gave salts of different color to the dyedium
 naam presiodemium greek prasinos, jiskaa arth he "hari", or didymos, "judawaan" se aata he
 Praseodymium is often misspelled as praseodynium

 By studying them, we also get a sense of what are the reactions on the matter coming from the sky in the global environment
 is prakaar ye pind brahmandavidya or bhuvigyaan ke bich sampark sthapit karte hai
 Although man was familiar with these falling stars from very ancient times, in the development of modern science, it took a long time for man to believe that these bodies found on the ground came from the sky on earth

 In 1768, Father Basile automatically saw a meteorite coming to Earth at a place called Luce in France
 agle varsh usne paris kii vigyaan kii royal academi ke adhiveshan main is vrittant par ek lekh padhaa
 Not believing the account, the Academy appointed a commission to investigate the incident, reporting that Father Basile's account was misleading, stating that the body of the body had become somewhat glassy due to lightning
 This led to the confusion of Basile that these bodies are not part of the earth

 The French Academy of Sciences thoroughly researched the rain, and in the end no one suspected that meteorites actually came to Earth from the mantle
 ulkapindon kaa mukhya vargeekaran unke sanghathan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Some bodies are mostly made of iron, nickel or alloys and some resemble stones made of silicate minerals
 pehle vargvaalon ko dhatvik or duusare vargvaalon ko aashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In addition, metallic and surprising substances are often found in the same quantity in some bodies, they are called metallic meteorites

 Depending on the structure, strains are made in all three classes
 aashmik pindon main do mukhya upbhed hai jinamein se ek ko kaundrite or duusare ko akundrite kehete hai
 The main feature of the first subclass is that some specific circular grains, called caudreule, are present in them
 jin pindon main kaundrul upasthit nahin rahete unhen akundrite kehete hai
 There are also two main strains in metallic meteorites which are called Ashtaniq and Shasthanik respectively
 ye naam pindon kii antarrachana vyakt karte hai or jaisaa in naamon se vyakt hota he, pehle vibhed ke pindon main dhatvik padaarth ke bandha ashtani aakaar main or duusare main shashthinik aakaar main vinyast hote hai
 This type of composition is called Vidmanstetter and it can be identified with great ease on the leaf page of the body
 dhatvashmik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upvarg hai jinhen krmanusaar pelesite or ardhdhathwik kehete hai
 The surprising part of the first subclass of these bodies is mainly made up of olivine minerals, which are often circular and are incorporated into a system of ferrous-nickel metals
 ardhdhathwik ulkapindon main mukhyat: piroxin or alp maatra main anaurthite felsapaar vidyaman hote hai
 It has been mentioned in the earlier case that meteorites are classified based on the primacy of metallic and astral organs
 kintu in pindon main rasinic tatwon or khanijon ke vitaran ke sambandh main koi sunishchit aadhaar prathit nahin hota
 Apart from the three main classes of meteorites, there are several subclasses, each with its own distinct mineral community

 The difficulty is that the materials available for study are very small

 anya saat main krmanusaar oxijan, silicon, manganisheium, gandhak, aluminium, nikal or calcium hai
 In addition to these, 20 other elements are found in sufficient quantity and their presence was detected before 1926 by simple chemical analysis
 shesh 24 tatv atyant alp maatra main vidyaman hai evam unki upasthiti varnakramadarshaki vishleshan se siddh kii gai he
 From the point of view of mineral composition there are many differences in the characteristics of meteorites and rocks found in the earth
 saadharantaya bhumandaleey shail raashiyon main swatantra dhaatu rup main loha tathaa nikal atyant durlabh hote hai, kintu ulkapindon main dhaatuen shuddh rup main bahut prachurtaa se tathaa praaia: anivaaryat: pai jaati hai
 In addition, there are many minerals that are not found in terrestrial rocks, but are found in meteorites
 inamen se pramukh oldemite or shribersite hai
 Both these minerals are not permanent in abundance of moisture and oxygen and hence are not found in global rocks
 inaki upasthiti se yah bodh hota he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti aise vaataavaran main hui jahaan bhumandal kii apeksha oxidikaran kii paristhitiyaan nune rahi hongi
 Astounding meteorites generally lack the abundance of pyroxene and olivine and lack of feldspar, making their organization similar to the superfamous rocks of the planet
 ulkapindon kii utpatti kaa vishay bahut hi vivaadaaspad he
 Several views have been proposed on this subject from time to time, in some of which they have been considered as part of Earth, Moon, Sun and Comet etc
 ek ati maanya mat ke anusaar inaki utpatti ek aise grah se hui jo ab purnataya vinasht ho gaya he
 In this view, it is imagined that in the beginning, there must have been a planet in the shape of Mars which was destroyed when it came very close to another big planet, or collided with another planet, due to which billions of small number Large blocks formed which are visible in meteorite form
 is mat ke anusaar dhatvik ulka us kalpit grah kaa kendriya bhaag tathaa aashmik ulka upree prishth nirupit karte hai
 Although this metaphor explains many symptoms of meteorites, many things remain an incomprehensible puzzle
 udaahranarth kuch dhatvik ulkapindon main ashtani rachana hoti he jo saadharantaya 800 degree centegrade taap par nasht ho jaati he
 It is believed that during the fission of that fictitious planet, there must have been more heat in it
 phir bhi yah samaj main nahin aata ki yah ashtani rachana vinasht hone se kaise bachi
 Similarly, there is also doubt as to where the iron came from in the Akundrite Awesome Meteor and how Kaunduyul was formed in the Kondrite Awesome Meteor
 ek anya mat main yah prastaavit kiya gaya he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti grahon ke saath saath ho hui, athwa yon kahana chahie ki soramandal evam samast khamandaleey padaartho kii utpatti ulkapindon se hi hui
 According to this fantasy, the primordial world was full of meteorites and in time, those bodies gathered in different masses and according to their maximum density, gasamic noharica, constellations and planets were born
 is kalpana kii ek badi truti yah prathit hoti he ki khamandal main upasthit ulkapind itani dur-dur chhitaraaye hue hai tathaa unka parsparik aakarshan itnaa ksheen he ki unke ekatra hokar badi raashi banane main atyadhik samay lagegaa
 But there is no doubt that once a sufficiently large amount of money is formed, it will be able to retain its power and will eventually increase its size by adding more bodies

 Therefore, plant pathology is the branch of agricultural science, botany or biology, under which the symptoms of diseases, causes, pathology, loss of ragas and their control are studied
 is vigyaan ke nimnlikhit pramukh uddeshy he: Plant pathology is a practical science, under which the factors of plant disease and their experimental solutions come
 chunki paudhe main rog kavak, jeevanu, vishaanu, micoplasma, sutarakrimi, pushpadhari aadi ke atirikt anya nirjeev kaarnon jaise jahrili gaison aadi se hota he
 Hence, the relation of plant pathology is related to other sciences such as fungology, bacteriology, mycoplasma science, microbiology, formula-worm science, crop physiology, genetics and agricultural chemistry
 prithvi par jab se manushya ne kheti karnaa armbh kiya he, us samay se hi padap rog bhi fasalon par utpann hote rahe hai
 In ancient scriptures like Vedas and Bible etc
, there are many descriptions of destruction of crops caused by plant diseases
 padap rog kaa mahatv, unke dwaara hone vaali haniyon ke kaaran bahut hi fidh gaya he
 Loss from diseases can occur at any time from field to storage or between sowing to harvesting, seed rot, humidification, hairy scorching, stems, deciduous, foliage, floral scorching and fruit decay in the life of the plant
 Is generated
 yadhyapi bharat main padap rogon dwaara hone vaali haani kaa sahi - sahi moolyankan nahin kiya gaya he
 But research has developed a predictive model by studying various factors related to the severe spread of some severe diseases like paddy and brown foliage, Karnal bunches of wheat and pungent scorching of potato

 The main examples of these ragas - bhandaarit anaaj par jab vibhinn prakaar ke kavak akraman karte hai to inke vinashtikaran ke saath unamem kuch vifaille padaarth bhi utpann hote hai jo manushyon evam pashuon unmaad, lakva, amashay ksht ityadi rogon kaa kaaran banate hai
 The rupee that is spent on the control of plant diseases is also a kind of loss and if this money is applied in other agricultural works, the production can be increased even more

the next day may see me once more, content as a hog upon ice,far down on the Florida shore, existing on bacon and rice
 i have hobnobbed with peasant and king, with a hundred to run at my call;i have seen the sweet flowers of spring lose their odor and grace before fall

 For the life of a rover is mine etc
 Gillette Burgess, the mischievous American writer and a member of the Bohemian Club, who invented the term "blurb", described this disorganized place named Bohemia as: His faults are more commonly those of self-indulgence, thoughtlessness, vanity and procrastination, and these usually go hand-in-hand with generosity, love and charity; for it is not enough to be one’s self in Bohemia, one must allow others to be themselves, as well
 


 What, then, is it that makes this mystical empire of Bohemia unique, and what is the charm of its mental fairyland? It is this: there are no roads in all Bohemia! One must choose and find one's own path, be one's own self, live one's own life

 The story of this film revolves around Wesley Gibson, a disgruntled office worker who discovers that he is the son of a professional killer and decides to join a secret organization called The Fraternity , In which his father worked
 april 2007 main iskaa nirmaan kaary shuru hua or check republic main iskaa pehle filmakan kiya gaya or baad main un sets ko chicago kii chhaviyon par adhyaropit kar diya gaya
 The Wanted film was released on 25 June 2008 in the United Kingdom and on 27 June 2008 in the United States, achieving both critical and commercial success
 22 janvari 2009 ko ise do academy puraskaron ke liye namankit kiya gaya: sarvshereshth dhwani sampadan or sarvshereshth dhvanimishran
 Wesley Gibson works with an arrogant boss who had no developmental scope and takes anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid panic attacks and stays with his girlfriend, who cheats on him after reuniting with his close friend
 is
 ek raat aushadhaalay main vesali ko fox naamak rahasyamayi mahila bataati he ki uske pita haal hi main maare gaye ek hatyare the or ab qaatil cross unke peeche he
 Firing between Cross and Fox follows, followed by a car on the streets of Chicago
 gibson ko ek hajaar saal puraane guptaghatak sanghathan da fraternity ke mukhyalay main laayaa jaataa he
 Sloan, the leader of the group, points out that Wesley's panic attack is virtually an untrained expression of a rare supernatural ability; When fatigued, a predominantly increased heart rate and adrenal supernatural force results in speed and reactions
 fraternity use is kshamta par niyantrit karnaa sikhaa sakati he jisase vesali apane pita kii sampati ko hasil karte hue, ek hatyare ke rup main unke naksh-e-qadam par chal saktaa he
 Wesley is initially reluctant and returns to his job, but eventually seizes the opportunity when he sees more than 3 million dollars in his bank account
 vah karyaalay main sabake saamne apane maalik ko fatkaarta he or apane "mitra" bairi ke chehre par kii-board patakata he
 Fox is waiting outside to take him back to Fraternity headquarters - a simple textile mill
 uske baad vesali ko kathor prashikshan diya jaataa he; hamalon ke anya qismon ke alaava vah smoothbor bandook se goli kii disha ko lakshya kii taraf ghumaane kii kala sikhta he
 After that, Wesley sees the loom of fate, a loom that informs who to target, through binary codes hidden in the fabric weaving error
 jinaki pahchaan kargha karwaata he, jahiraa taur par bhavishya main ve vipatti kaa kaaran ban sakate hai, lekin keval slone unhen dekhtaa or naamon ko samajhataa he ki "qismat" kise maarna chaahati he
 Wesley initially hesitates to kill the people
 lekin fox use bataati he ki uske bachapan main ek bhaade ke qaatil ne uske pita ko uske saamne hi jinda jala diya tha- or kahati he ki vah hatyara fraternity ke haathon maaraa janaa tha
 Now its purpose is to prevent such tragedy
 kai niyamit mishnon or cross se mulaakaat ke sanyog ke baad, jisamen vesali kii baanh ek khojane yogya goli se aahat kii jaati he, slone pita kii maut kaa badla lene kii vesali kii ichha ko puraa karne kii anumati detaa he or use cross ke peeche bhejtaa he - lekin gupt rup se fox ko vesali ko maarane kaa mishan yah kehete hue saunpta he ki uskaa naam bhi karghe main aa chukaa he
 Wesley's analysis of the bullet shows that the manufacturer of the bullet was Pekwarski, a resident of East Moravia
 vesali or fox vahaan pahunchate hai or pekwarski ko kabje main lete hai, jo cross ke saath unki baithak kii vyavastha karata he
 Wesley competes alone on a moving train with a cross
 fox ek car churaati he or use rail ke saath takaraati he, jiske chalate rail apni patari se utar jaati he
 After Cross saves Wesley from falling into the valley, Wesley shoots him
 marane se pehle cross bataata he ki vah vesali kaa asli pita he
 Fox confirms the truth and reveals that Wesley was recruited because he is the only person Cross cannot kill
 Fox then reveals an order to kill Wesley and raises his gun, but Wesley escapes by shooting the glass beneath him and leaping into the river below
 vesali ko pekwarski dhundh letaa he or use uske pita ke ghar le jaataa he, jo uske puraane ghar kii gali ke paar rahata he
 Pekwarski explains to him that after Sloan finds himself the target of the loom of fate, the targets for profit begin to form and the members of the Fraternity do not tell that they were now anything other than salaried assassins
 cross ne sach kaa pataa laga liya tha or vah hatyara ban gaya or fraternity ke sadasyon se apane bete ko dur rakhane ke liye unki hatya karnaa shuru kar di
 Pekwarski goes on to say that Wesley's father wanted his son to live a violence-free life
 But Wesley decides to take revenge on Sloan after discovering a secret room containing all of his father's weapons and maps
 fretrenity ke lagbhag sabhi sadasyon kii hatya karne ke baad jab vah slone ke karyaalay main pravesh karata he, to vah kamare main maujuud master hatyaron ke saamne slone ke dhokhe kii pole kholta he
 Sloan then states that all of them came to be named in the weave and that he had only acted to save them
 agar ve code kaa paalan karte hai, to har ek ko maukey par hi khud ko maar dena chahie
 Otherwise they should kill Wesley
 fox jo apane anubhav ke kaaran, dusron se zyaada code par bharosa karti he, apane saathi hatyare kii taraf mudati he or "ghumaav" vaali goli chalaati he jo uske saath-saath kamare main maujuud sabhi fraternity sadasyon ko maar detaa he or keval vesali batch jaataa he
 Sloan manages to escape somehow
 vesali dubaara daridr ho jaataa he or nahin jaan paata ki use kya karnaa chahie
 When Wesley gives a voice, the audience sees a person looking like Wesley sitting in front of the computer, as seen in the opening scene of the film
 slone prakat hota he or us vyakti ke sir ke peeche bandook kaa nishaanaa sadhta he
 At the same time, the man turns back and discovers that he is a pawn to trap him
 uske baad slone ko vesali lambii-duuri kii goli se maar detaa he, jise khoj paanaa mumkin nahin
 Similar to the comic, the film also ends with Wesley turning in the direction of the camera and smashing the fourth wall, saying "this is me, who is taking his life back under control

 Although all small electronic components are used in power electronics, the following components are unique identities of power electronics
 shakti electronic ke kshetra main kaary, laghu-sanket-electraniki ke bhi pehle ho chukaa tha
 Electric machines were first used for the control and conversion of electric power
 iske baad mercury arq ractifire kaa prayog hua
 Then came the era of vacuum and gas-filled valves
 san 1957 main esasiaar ke vikaas se shakti electronic main ek nayi disha mili
 Nowadays, the use of switches like SCR, GTO, BJT, MOSFET, IGBT, etc
 is done very efficiently
 is kaaran shakti electronic kaa kshetra bahut vyapak evam mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Electronics is the department of science in which electric power is efficiently converted to the desired voltage, frequency, current by using electron tubes or semiconductor devices performing similar functions
 vastav main baat yah he ki vidyut shakti hame jis rup main main praapt hoti he usee rup main vah bahut kam upyog main laayi jaati he
 For example, an industry receives electric power in the form of 415 volts, 50 Hz AC
 use vidyutlepan karnaa he jiske liye 0 se 20 volt disi chaiye jisamen se shunya se lekar 1200 ampir dhara bahegi
 It is clear that the power we are getting cannot be directly used for this work, rather it will have to be changed
 yah kaam shakti electraniki dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there are thousands of examples where electric power cannot be used as it is, rather it has to be changed to some other form
 electraneey yuktiyon main se mahatvapurn upyog ye hai : Many of today's most modern devices also cannot be made without electronics, such as radio, television, movies, fluorescence light, public lecture-system, telephone etc
 ye sab yuktiyaan electraniki kii hi dein hai
 Some of the industrial uses of electronics are briefly mentioned below: udyogon main bahudhaa rujukarak upyog main laae jate hai, jinase prayavarti vidyut-dhara nirdisht dhara main badali jaati he
 They are often of one of the following types: adhik shakti ke rujukari main bahukala rujukari paripathon kaa upyog ekkala rujukari paripathon ke upyog kii upeksha anek kaarnon se adhik laabhadaayak hota he
 The first reason is that nowadays electric power is produced and distributed in the form of tri-art-power
 dwitiya kaaran yah he ki bahukala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata ekkala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata kii apeksha adhik sam hoti he
 In the above mentioned high power loan, either the same loan is kept for many moneylenders or many money bankers, whose loan lines are connected, are used
 donon hi prakaar ke runagra prayog main laae jate hai
 The speed of the motor is controlled exclusively in paper mills, because the thickness of the paper depends on the speed itself
 in yantron main exciter ke kshetra kii pravaati dhara main parivartan kiya jaataa he, jo janitr ke liye niyantrak kshetra kaa utpaadan karata he
 This generator is driven by a prime mover
 janitr kaa armechar apana utpaadan us motor ko detaa he jisaki chaal kaa niyantran karnaa hota he
 a sight-current generator is driven by this motor; It produces a voltage proportional to its speed
 yadi vah voltata purvanishchit voltata se bhinn hoti he to ek niamak ko sakriy kar detii he
 This regulator makes such a change in the area of the exciter that the current of the motor falls to a predetermined value
 is niamak main anek naliyon kaa upyog hota he
 Thus with the help of electronics, the speed of the motor can be controlled to a minimum value
 ucch aavriti se garam karne ke audyogic upyog-atyadhik shaktishaalee ucch aavriti uttapadak kaa upyog parvidyut tathaa praren dwaara garam karne main bahut kiya ja rahaa he
