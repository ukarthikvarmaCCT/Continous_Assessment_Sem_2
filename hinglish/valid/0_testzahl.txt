 jinagar jati kaa itihaas ek vishaal evam vaibhavshaalee jati kaa rahaa he
 Jinnagar caste was basically a Kshatriya caste, but in the course of time, the country had to adopt various craft works, commerce and business
 jinagar kshatriya se kab va kaise jinagar hogaye ye ek khoj parak vishay tha
 The society continued to do a lot of research on this subject, but this work was done by Dr
 Radheshyamji who, with great effort and tireless efforts, proved through history and the gazette and various tribes and articles of King Maharaja that the genus Jatrajati is indeed a Kshatriya caste
 daan radheshyaamji ne apni samast khoj va jaankaree ko ek pustak rup me aktrit kiya tathaa use "zinagar kshatriya itihaas" naam diya
 This book was released on 15 May 1946 at Mandsaur on Wednesday by Akhilbharatiya Jinnagar Kshatriya Mahasabha, president of Shriman Dhanomal Rathod Hyderabad
 is pustak me jinagar kshatriyo ke bareme bahut hi vistarit jaankaree di gayi he
 According to him, Bhagwan Parshuram made a pledge to completely destroy the Kshatriyas and started destroying all the Kshatriyas from the earth
 jab parashuramji ne "nagar-sthaan" ke raaj vanshio kaa sarv naash kar diya to waha se keval ratan sen maharaj hi batch kar dadhich rishi ke ashramakegi me gupt rup se pahunch gayi
 But he was also killed there
 tab ratan sen ke bade putr zay sen jo batch kar bhaag gayi the, ke dwaara pun: "nagar-sthaan" kaa rajya sthapit karne se is vansh kaa naam jayanagar kshatriya kahalaaya jo ki kaalaantar me jinagar kshatriya ho gaya jo aaj tak prachlit he
 Therefore, it is proved that the people of Jinnagar belong to the eldest son of the state of the same Suryavanshi "city-place", Jayasen
 jaysen ek bahut hi nek dil, diler, bahadur va nyaay priy kushal shaasha the
 His fame and fame had spread all over, causing the neighbors of India - Arbo, Afgano, Turko and Mangolo - to lure them and start carrying out foji attacks on the "city-place"
 baar baar hamale se arthvyavastha tootne lagi tathaa ek baar malaccho ne nau maas tak "nagar-sthaan" ko ghere rakhaa evam yuddh chalata rahaa
 The Kshatriyas of Jai Nagar fought against Dutkar and in the end lakhs of soldiers got valor-speed and all were killed in the great Yodha war, due to which all the survivors of this forest were uprooted and they escaped to save their lives

 This is why the people of Jinnagar caste settled in different cities of the country
 raajputana me basane ke baad sabase bady samasya aajivika kii thi, atah kshatriya gun dharm hone se rajgaraane ke vibhinnkaarya jese talwaar bananaa, myaan bananaa, ghodo kii jin bananaa, rajasi kapado par chhapaai aadi kaary prarambh kar diya
 In this way, their Kshatriya religion was not destroyed in Kshatriya protection, and Azivika also continued, and these people remained in contact with the royal families and these were called Jinnagar Kshatriyas
 inke vibhinn kaary anusaar inaki nau nyaati kahalaayi jo nimnanusaar he: Zinagar Panigar Sifliger Myanagar Dhaigar Chiligar Netgar Dhalgar Painter | samaaj me punch panchayaat tathaa anya avasaroper sabhi nau nyaat ko bulaayaa jaataa tha tathaa aapas me shaadi byaah va sambandh hotethe
 The Zinagar caste belongs to the Kshatriya clan, it is mentioned in an ancient book, dated 1860-1900 in Vikram, during the time of Jodhpur, Shriman Maharaja Mansinhji, written by Rajkavi Kaviraj Shri Seshadasji Charan "historical Bate"
 is granth kii hast likhit prati jodhpur rajya ke mahkme me surakshit he
 In the said text, number 2466 is written that "the special origin of the caste of Zinagar is from the Kshatriya clan itself
 parantu ye log bhagwan parashuramji ke dar se duusari jati me ginane lage
 Their gotra and the tribe of oriental Kshatriyas are the same
 itnaa hinahi, marwar rajya ke jodhpur me kareeb shatabdi purv bane makaano ke sarkari patto me jinagar raajput naam miltaa he
 This proves that the Jinnagar caste belongs to the Kshatriya clan
 As mentioned above, the people of the Jinnagar caste used to live their lives only by doing crafts and work of commerce, which depended only on the dependent work of King Maharaja

 pracheen sanskrit sahitya main dhanush ke anek naam milte hai, jaise saarang, kodand, cormuk, dhanu, chaap aadi
 It is difficult to say whether these words express the same type of bow, or are the names of different bow types

 Famous book of children's literature composed by Ashwaghosh
 kisi bhashaa main jin siddhanton evam prakriyaaon ke dwaara vaakya banate hai, unke adhyayan ko bhashaa vigyaan main vaakyavinyas, 'vaakyavigyaan' yaa cintax kehete hai
 The serial study of a sentence is called 'syntaxology'
 vaakya vigyaan, padon ke parsparik sambandh kaa adhyayan he
 The sentence is the most important part of the language
 manushya apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti vaakyon ke madhayam se hi karata he
 Hence, sentence is the shortest complete unit of language
 vaakya vigyaan ke antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he- vaakya kii paribhaasha, vaakyon or bhashaa ke anya ag kaa sambandha, vaakyon ke prakaar, vaakyon main parivartan, vaakyon main padon kaa kram, vaakyon main parivartan ke kaaran aadi
 Dr
 Kapil Dev Dwivedi has discussed in detail about the nature of syntax
 unka mat is prakaar haih- The difference between phraseology and syntax is that creation of terms is discussed in the post-science
 atah usamen pad vibhaajan, kaarak, vibhakti, vachan, ling, kaal, purush aadi ke bodhak shabd kis prakaar banate hai, is par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Syntax is next to that
 isamen purvakt vidhi se bane hue padon kaa kahan, kis prakaar se rakhane se arth main kya antar hota he, aadi vishyon kaa vivechan he
 Sound is a building element
 jaise mitti, kapaas aadi; pad bane hue ve tatva hai, jinka upyog kiya ja saktaa he, jaise- eent, vastra aadi; vaakya vah rup he, jo vaastavik rup main prayog main aata he, jaise- makaan, sile vastra aadi
 If the verse is a brick then the sentence is a house or building
 tattvik drushti se dhwani, pad or vaakya main moulik antar he
 Voice is basically related to pronunciation
 yaa shaareerik vyapaar se utpann hoti he, atah dhwani main mukhyatya shaareerik vyapaar pradhan he
 The verse coordinates both sound and meaning
 dhwani shaareerik paksh he or sarthakata maansik paksh he
 The coordination of both physical and mental elements in the verse makes it suitable for use in a sentence
 sarthakata kaa sambandh vichaar se he
 Thought is the work of the mind, so there is mental business in the post
 vaakya main vichaar, vichaaron kaa samanvay, sarthak evam samanvit rup main abhivyakti, ye sabhi kaary vichaar or chintan se sambhddha he, atah maansik kaary he
 The mental or psychological aspect is important in a sentence
 vichaaron kii purna abhivyakti vaakya se hoti he, atah vaakya hi bhashaa kaa sookshmatam sarthak ikai mana jaataa he
 Their distinction can also be revealed in this way- vishnu khare ek pramukh kavi, aalochak, anuvadak evam patrkaar hai
 The first book of criticism is his famous criticism book

 In the structure of Internet-related addresses, a private network is a network that uses private IP address space, following the standards set by RFC 1918 and RFC 4193
 jab vaishvik maarg se bheje jane yogya paton kii anivaaryta nahin hoti he yaa phir ye apekshit network anuprayogon ke liye uplabdh nahin hote hai to in paton kaa istemaal aam taur par ghar, karyaalay or udhyam ke local aria networkon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The locations of private IP addresses were originally defined in an attempt to delay the nullification of ipv4 addresses but can also be seen in the next generation Internet protocol, ipv6
 in paton ko privet ke rup main isliye paribhaashit kiya jaataa he kyonki inhen vaishvik str par nahin diya gaya he, matlab yah ki inhen kisi vishisht sanghathan ko aavantit nahin kiya jaataa he or inke dwaara sambodhit ypi packeton ko saarvajanik internet par prasaarit nahin kiya jaataa he
 These addresses can be used by anyone without approval from the Regional Internet Registry
 agar is tarah ke privet network ko internet se jodne kii jarurat hoti he to iske liye yaa to ek network pataa anuvadak getwe yaa phir ek proxi sarwar kaa istemaal karnaa anivaary he
 The most common use of these addresses is in residential networks, since most Internet service providers allocate an IP address sent to each residential customer through a one-way route only, but most households have more than one network device, for example, Many computers and a video game console
 In this case a NAT gateway is typically used to enable Internet connectivity for many users
 nijee paton ko saamanytah corporate networkon main bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he jo suraksha kaarnon se internet se sidhe taur par jude nahin hote hai
 a proxy, SOCKS gateway or other similar devices are often used to provide limited access to the Internet to internal users of the network
 donon hi maamalon main nijee paton ko aksar aantarik network ke liye behatar suraksha ke rup main dekha jaataa he kyonki internet host ke liye sidhe taur par ek aatanrik pranali se sambandh jodna mushkil hota he
 Because many private networks use the same IP address, a common problem arises in mixing such networks together, the collision of address locations, ie the duplication of addresses on many devices
 In this case, the network must essentially re-number which is often a time-consuming task, or a NAT router must be placed between networks to hide the copied addresses
 nijee paton ke sthanon main banane vaale packeton kaa internet par li hona asaamaanya nahin he
 Poorly configured private networks often try to look for these addresses in reverse DNS, causing additional traffic problems for Internet route nameservers

 Organizational sector routers were typically designed to reduce the arrival of IP traffic to these networks which could either be sudden or could be done through malicious traffic using a fake source address

 The Internet Engineering Task Force has directed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority to reserve the following ipv4 addresses range for private networks, as published in RFC 1918: classphul adressing ab aprachlit he or 1993 main shuru kiye gaye classles inter-domen rooting ke lagu hone ke baad se internet main iskaa prayog nahin kiya gaya he
 For example, while 10

 The address block fc00 :: / 7 has been reserved by IANA as described in RFC 4193
 in paton ko unic local adresses kaha jaataa he
 Their character is defined as unicast and a 40-bit random number exists in the routing prefix to prevent collisions when two private networks are interconnected

 Historically, other address blocks have been reserved for other possible uses of the future than the range of private addresses

 lekin 11 agast 1961 ko yah pradesh bhartiya sangh main shaamil ho gaya or tab se bharat sarkaar ek centreshasit pradesh ke rup main iskaa prashasan kar rahi he
 Since the liberation of the region from the clutches of Portugal, the 'senior Panchayat' was functioning as a consultative body of administration but it was dissolved in 1989 and at the pan-india level in accordance with the Constitution amendment Dadra and Nagar Haveli District Panchayat and a state council of 11 gram panchayats was formed

 Under which, the demand for political representation raised by Babasaheb gave the Dalit class the right to two votes
 ek vot se dalit apana pratinidhi chunenge tathaa duusari vot se saamaanya varg kaa pratinidhi chunenge
 Thus the Dalit representative was to be elected only by the vote of the Dalits

 At the same time, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs
 is samjhaute par hastakshar karke babasahab ne gandhi ko jeevandaan diya
 Ambedkar was inattentive to the deal, calling Gandhi's fast as a play played by Gandhi to deprive untouchables of their political rights and pressurize them to withdraw from their demands

 An authentic version of its original text has also been published in the editing of Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra as 'keshava-granthvali, Part-2' from Hindustani Academy, Allahabad
 'ramchandra chandrika' 39 prakaashon main katha suchi sahit 1717 chhandon main puraa hua he
 According to Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra, although the well-known Ramakatha is described in this, it is a poetry of poetry, not of devotion
 keshav 'nimbark sampradaay' main dikshit hone ke naate radha krishna ke upaask the, ram ke nahin
 Although Ramachandrika is a Ramakatha epic, the narrative in it differs from the Valmiki Ramayana and the Ramcharitmanas
 haalaanki kavi ke ullekh ke anusaar is mahakavy ko rachane kii prerana unhen adikavi valmiki se hi mili
 They wrote that is ke purvardh kii katha valmikiy ramayana se kuch-kuch samya bhi rakhata he kintu uttarardh main kavi kii nijee udbhaavna evam vyavastha hi pramukh he
 The poet's erudition is demonstrated through this poetry
 samvaad-yojana, alankaar-yojana, chand-yojana kii drushti se yah kavy kavi ke acharyatv ke kaushal ko hi prastut karata he
 In this, the poet has broken the well-known narrative tradition
 vastutah unhone is granth-rachana main pratyaksh sahyog sanskrit ke 'prasanraghav', 'hanumannatak' aadi granthon se liya he
 'kadambari' also has a clear effect
 naatakon kaa aadhaar lene se or katha bhaag chhod dene se samvaad ke vaktaaon ke naam inhen padya se pruthak rakhane pade hai
 The dialogue-planning is done in a dramatic way, so it can be used with visual simplicity as a special feature
 keshav ke is kavyagranth main bhakthi kii pradhanta na hote hue bhi ram ko avtari mana gaya he tathaa anek sthalon par unase upadesh dilaayaa gaya he
 As a result, the didactic passages have become substantial and poetry has been damaged
 keshav ko reetikaal kaa yuganirmaataa sahityakar tathaa hindi kaa pratham acharya kavi mana gaya he
 From this point of view, the predominance of Acharyatva is also evident in Ramachandrika
 style kii drushti se isamen vividh prakaar ke chhandon ke udhaaharan prastut karne kii pravriti dikhaai padati he
 It seems that poets are teaching someone the method of pingle
 ramchandrika kii bhashaa sanskritpradhan brajabhasha he
