 Waxing is a semi-permanent method of removing unwanted hair that removes hair from the roots
 pehle se vaix kiye hue bhaag main nae bal, do se aath saptaah se pehle nahin ugte hai
 Wax can be done in almost any part of the body, such as the arms, face, bikini, legs, hands, back, lower abdomen, and paw
 kai prakaar ke vexing uplabdh hai jo anachaahe baalo ko hataane ke liye upyukt hai
 a thin layer of wax mixture is spread on the skin to complete the waxing process
 uske baad ek kapade yaa kaagaj kii pattee ko uske upar dabaaya jaataa he or phir use baalo ke ugane kii disha main ek jatke main khinchaa jaataa he
 It also removes hair with wax
 ek anya vidhi main sakht mom kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he 
 isamen, mom kii thodi moti parat lagaai jaati he or kisi kapade yaa kaagaj kii pattee kaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa he
 The wax hardens when cooled due to which it is easily removed by a physician with the help of a cloth
 vexing vidhi samvedansheel twachaa vaale vyaktiyon ke liye bahut phydemand hoti he
 Different types of waxing are available
 jinamein se kuch license praapt cosametologyst yaa esthetician ke dwaara kiya janaa chahie
 The different types of waxing that can be done are: sharir ke adhikansh bhaagon par vexing kiya ja saktaa he, lekin uparokt suchi main darj nahin kiye jane vaale bhaagon par vishesh dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he
 The parts that a person should never wax are the area inside the ear and nose as well as the eyelash, eyelids, palms of hands and soles of feet
 This is particularly noticeable as the skin of these parts is sensitive and can be severely damaged when waxed
 bal hataane kii anya vidhiyon kii tulana main vexing ke bahut se laabh hai
 It is an effective method of removing large amounts of hair at once
 yah ek lambey samay tak prabhavi rahane vaali vidhi he
 In the waxed part, the hair will not grow back for two to eight weeks
 When the hair is removed by shaving or a depilatory cream, it is removed from the top of the skin rather than at the roots
 kuch dinon ke bheetar hi, bal sataha par dikhne lagata he
 Using these methods, the hair is as tough as a short beard while growing
 jin angon par lambe samay se vaix kiya jaataa rahaa he unpar punah ugane vaale bal naram hote hai
 Waxing also has many drawbacks
 vexing pattee ko twachaa se khinch kar hataanaa dardanaak ho saktaa he
 Although this pain is not permanent, it can be particularly acute on more sensitive skin
 vexing kii ek anya kami he usamen lagane vaala kharch: vexing kii prakriya aam taur par license praapt esthitisian dwaara kiya jaataa he, isliye isko karwaane kii keemat kaaphi zyada hoti he, jo bal hathaaye jane vaale ang or kitne upachaar aavashyak hai is ke aadhaar par kai sau dollar tak ho saktaa he
 Self-waxing is also present, but it can be difficult to use on some parts of the body on its own
 bal hataanaa sthai nahin hota
 If it is removed in the opposite direction of hair growth, these wax strips can obstruct the hair follicles, causing the hair to grow in different directions
 iske kaaran baalo kaa vikaas or adhik najar aane lagata he or yah bal hataane kii anya vidhiyon ko kathin bana detaa he
 Fortunately, the risk in waxing is negligible when done correctly
 vexing kii ek anya kami yah he ki kuch logon ko antarvardhit bal, laal sujan or zaraa si khun nikalne kii shikaayat bhi ho sakati he
 This is more likely to happen when waxing on thick hairy sections, especially when done for the first time when the pores become hard
 jabaki ise puri tarah se khatm karnaa asambhav he, antarvardhit baalo ko nimna trikon se kam kiya ja saktaa he jaise niyamit rup se apshalkit karne se or ek astringent yaa astringent or tel ke ek mishran ko lagane se
 Like all beauty treatments waxing also has opposite indications to restrict or interrupt the treatment

 The system of Gond rulers was that the head of the caste was the head ruler and the state was divided among relatives who were under the head ruler

 It is worth noting that 'garh' is not a Sanskrit word, it is a non-aryan language

ek baar jab vishnupriya lakshmi ne shani se puunchhaa ki tum kyon jaatakon ko dhan haani karte ho, kyon sabhi tumhaare prabhaav se pratadit rahete hai, to shani maharaj ne uttar diya,"mateshwari, usame meraa koi dosha nahi he, parampita paramatma ne mujhe tino lokon kaa nyaayadhish niyukt kiya hua he, isaliye jo bhi tino lokon ke andar anyaay karata he, use dand dena meraa kaam he"
ek aakhyaan or miltaa he, ki kis prakaar se rishi agast ne jab shani dev se prarthana kii thi, to unhone rakshason se unako mukti dilwaai thi
 Whoever did injustice, he punished them, even if it was Lord Shiva's Ardhangini Sati, who, after taking the form of Sita, lied to Baba Bhole Nath, and in consequence he was sacrificed in the sacrifice of his own father
 Shani Dev forced to die by burning in the pool, or Raja Harishchandra, whose pride of donating had to be sold in the seventh market and even to keep the crematorium Take the Padi, or King Nal and Damayanti, for the punishment of their frivolous sins, they have to wander from rate to rate, and the fished fish swim away in the water, then whatever manna, covenant, by ordinary man Karmana is sinned, whether it is done in the know or unknown, it will have to suffer

 shani mand he or shani hi thandak dene vaala he,surya naam ujaalaa to shani naam andheraa, pehle bhav me apana sthaan banane kaa kaaran he ki shani apane gochar kii gati or apni dasha me shok paidaa karegaa,jeev ke andar shok kaa dukh milte hi vah aage peeche sab kuch bhul kar keval andhere me hi khoyaa rahata he
 Saturn becomes the object of witchcraft, when Saturn gives its momentum in the first house, the first house is the only one, when the darkness starts hiding, the light is recognized and when the position is hidden then the shadow of Saturn Only darkness can be considered
 andhere ke kai rup hote hai, ek andheraa vah hota he jiske kaaran kuch bhi dikhaai nahi detaa he, yah ankhon kaa andheraa mana jaataa he, ek andheraa samajhane kaa bhi hota he, saamne kuch hota he, or samajha kuch jaataa he, ek andheraa buraaiyon kaa hota he, vyakti yaa jeev kii sabhi achchhaaiyaan buraaiyon ke andar chupane kaa kaaran bhi shani kaa diya gaya andheraa hi mana jaataa he, naam kaa andheraa bhe hota he, kisi ko pataa hi nahi hota he, ki koun he or kahaan se aayaa he, koun maan he or koun baap he, aadi ke dwaara kisi bhi rup me chhupav bhi shani ke kaaran hi mana jaataa he, vyakti chaalaaki kaa putala ban jaataa he pratham bhav ke shani ke dwaara
shani apane sthaan se pratham bhav ke andar sthiti rakh kar tisare bhav ko dekhtaa he, teesraa bhav apane se chote bhai bahino kaa bhi hota he, apni andaruni takat kaa bhi hota he, parakram kaa bhi hota he, jo kuch bhi ham dusron se kehete he, kisi bhi saadhan se, kisi bhi tarah se shani ke kaaran apni baat ko sampreshit karne me kathinaayee aati he, jo kaha jaataa he vah saamne vaale ko yaa to samaj me nahi aata he, or aata bhi he to ek bhayanak andheraa hone ke kaaran vah kahi gayi baat ko na samajhane ke kaaran kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, parinaam ke andar fal bhi jo chaiye vah nahi miltaa he, aksar dekha jaataa he ki jiske pratham bhav me shani hota he, uskaa jivan saathi jor jor se bolnaa chaalu kar detaa he, uskaa kaaran uske dwaara jor jor se bolne kii aadat nahi, pratham bhav kaa shani sunne ke andar kami kar detaa he, or saamne vaale ko jor se bolne par hi yaa to sunaayi detaa he, yaa vah kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, isi liye jivan saathi ke saath kuch sunne or kuch samajhane ke kaaran maansik naa samajhi kaa parinaam sambandhon me kaduvaahat ghul jaati he, or sambandh tut jate hai
 From its first house, the tenth eye directly looks at the spirit of karma, this is also the spirit of karma
 jataka ko karm karne or karm ko samajhane me kaafii kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pasta he, jab kisi prakaar se karm ko nahi samajha jaataa he to jo bhi kiya jaataa he vah karm na hokar ek bhaar swaroop hi samajha jaataa he, yahi baat pita ke prati maan lee jaati he,pita ke prati shani apni sift ke anusaar andhera detaa he, or us andhere ke kaaran pita ne putr ke prati kya kiya he, samaj nahi hone ke kaaran pita putr main anban bhi bani rahati he,putr kaa lagan yaa pratham bhav kaa shani mata ke chauthe bhav me chalaa jaataa he, or mata ko jo kaam nahi karne chaiye ve usko karne passage hai, kathin or ek seemaa me rahakar mata ke dwaara kaam karne ke kaaran uskaa jivan ek ghere main bandhaa sa rah jaataa he, or vah apni shariri sift ko us prakaar se prayog nahi kar paati he jis prakaar se ek saadhaaran aadmi apni jindagi ko jeena chahta he
 The second house is the sense of material wealth, by physical wealth means, rupee, money, gold, silver, diamond, pearl, jewelry, etc
 When Shani Dev is in the second house, he also keeps his dark towards his family members, Only by getting family members to fight, quarrel etc
, they distance themselves from their own family, in the matter of money, it is not known how much came and how much was spent, how much did it come from, the second feeling is the sense of speaking, whatever It is talked about, He does not know what has been said, can also be abusive and cold talk also, cold talk means negative thing, be asked to do any thing, nor should it come out in the north
 Also, the fourth house is also related to the mother, house, and vehicle, the fourth house is also known for its pleasures, in the second Saturn, nothing is seen except the traveling work and sleeping in the house
 doosraa shani sidhe rup me aathven bhav ko dekhtaa he, aathva bhav shamshani takaton kii taraf rujhaan badhaa detaa he, vyakti bhoot,pret,jinn or pishachi shaktiyon ko apnaane main apana man laga detaa he, shamshani sadhana ke kaaran uskaa khan paan bhi shamshani ho jaataa he,sharaab,kebab or bhoot ke bhojan main uski ruchi batch jaati he
 Second Saturn also sees the eleventh house, the eleventh house darkens its faith towards immovable property, darkens the mind towards friends and elder brothers and sisters
 ve kuch karnaa chaahate hai lekin vyakti ke dimag main kuch or hi samaj me aata he
 The third sense is of might, of the courage and courage of the person, wherever the person lives, of his neighbors
 in sabake kaarnon ke andar tisare bhav se shani pancham bhav ko bhi dekhtaa he, jiname shiksha,santan or turat aane vaale dhano ko bhi janaa jaataa he, mitron kii sahabhaagita or bhabhi kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa bhav mana jaataa he, pita kii mrityu kaa or dada ke bade bhai kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa he
 Apart from this, the third Shani also hurts the ninth house, in which knowledge of religion, social behavior, old customs and family practice etc
 is also hurt
 makaan or aaraam karne vaale sthano ke prati yah shani apni andhere vaali niti ko pratipaadit karata he
 This Saturn tortures Nanihal family
 chauthe bhav kaa mukhya prabhaav vyakti ke liye kaafii ksht dene vaala hota he, mata, man, makaan, or pani vaale saadhan, tathaa sharir kaa pani is shani ke prabhaav se gandala jaataa he, aaajeevan kshtdhene vaala hone se puraano me is shani vaale vyakti kaa jivan nark may hi bataaya jaataa he
 If this Saturn is of Libra, Capricorn, Aquarius or Pisces, then there is some reduction in sufferings in its fruit
 is bhav me shani ke hone ke kaaran vyakti ko mantra vetta bana detaa he, vah kitne hi good mantron ke dwaara logo kaa bhala karne vaala to ban jaataa he, lekin apane liye jivan saathi ke prati,jaaydaad ke prati, or nagad dhan ke saath jamaa puunji ke liye dukh hi uthaaya karata he
 Due to the presence of Saturn in the child and being cold, there is a delay in the child, there is a lot of female child, due to the loss of life with a partner, he remains more indifferent to his life
 is bhav me shani kitne hi daihik daivik or bhautik rogon kaa daata ban jaataa he, lekin is bhav kaa shani paariwarik shatruta ko samaapt kar detaa he,mamaa khandaan ko samaapt karne vaala hota he,chachaa khandan se kabhi banati nahi he
 If a person keeps on doing the work done in some way, then he is successful, if somehow he does the work of the owner then he fails
 apni teesri najar se aathven bhav ko dekhne ke kaaran se vyakti dur drishti se kisi bhi kaam yaa samasya ko nahi samaj paata he, kaaryon se kisi na kisi prakaar se apane prati jokhim ko nahi samaj paane se jo bhi kamata he, yaa jo bhi kiya jaataa he, uske prati andheraa hi rahata he, or aksmaat samasya aane se pareshaan hokar jo bhi paas me hota he ganvaa detaa he
 Due to the darkness in the twelfth house, there is also ignorance of the external calamities, for whatever reason they become external, they are either duped by them or they find themselves hurt due to Saturn's tricks of outsiders
 khud ke chote bhai bahin kya kar rahe hai or unki kaary pranali khud ke prati kya he uske prati anjaan rahata he
 Often, when this sign of Saturn comes, it gives way to disorientation, and often such people forget even in the known place
 saatvaan bhav patni or mantranaa karne vaale logo se apana sambandh rakhata he
 Due to the darkness of life partner and the persistence of negative thoughts in the mind, the person always considers himself to be a childless in everything, the life partner starts to get away from the native with a little bit of time only after being denied as a negation, If the native could not make positive thoughts towards himself, then in most cases the householders have been seen to be ruined, and the result of two marriages is due to the seventh Saturn
 He has been seen to be found, seventh Saturn remains indifferent to the old customs and towards his ancestors, only because of thinking about himself and i cannot do anything, due to the continuation of his old dignity
 It is often forgotten, because of the status of work and non-functioning in father and son, there is a rift
 vyakti apane rahane vaale sthaan par apane kaaran banaakar ashaanti utpann karata rahata he, apni mata yaa mata jaisi mahila ke man me virodh bhi paidaa karata rahata he, use lagata he ki jo bhe uske prati kiya ja rahaa he, vah galat hi kiya ja rahaa he or isi kaaran se vah apane hi logon se virodh paidaa karne me nahi hichakataa he
 Due to the effect of this Saturn on the body's water, the mind's thoughts get dirty, the person gets the diseases of the stomach and the reproductive organs in his body, and the diseases of the female child, etc
 due to this Saturn
 is bhav kaa shani khaane pine or mouj masti karne ke chakkar main jeb hameshaa khaali rakhata he
 Because of not knowing which work to do, the rise of vagabond in the person has been seen, Saturn of the higher gives ability to supernatural knowledge, even secret knowledge is also a factor of Saturn
 navaan bhav bhagya kaa mana gaya he, is bhav main shani hone ke kaaran se kathin or dukh daayi yatraayen karne ko milti hai, lagaataar gum kar cells aadi ke kaamo me kaafii pareshaani kerani padati he, agar yah bhav sahi hota he, to vyakti mazaakia hota he, or har baat ko chutkulon ke dwaara kaha karata he, magar jab is bhav me shani hota he to vyakti syrius ho jaataa he, or ekaant main apane ko rakhane apni bhalaai sochataa he, nawein bhav baale shani ke ke kaaran vyakti apni pahichaan ekaant vaasa jhagadaa na jhansa vaali kahawat se purna rakhata he
 Cultivating works, house-building works, works for property related work
 agar koi acha grah is shani par apni najar rakhata he to vyakti jaj vaale kaamo kii taraf or court kachhari vaale kaamon kii taraf apana rujhaan rakhata he
 Doctors of animals and also teach animals, most of the ninth Saturn people love to raise animals
 kitabon ko chhapakar bechney vaale bhi nawein shani se kahi na kahi jude hote hai
 Tenth Saturn takes the mind towards hard work, whatever are the hard work, wood, stone, iron etc
 They all come in the area of saturn tenth, the person creates a field towards work in his life and that area Does not want to leave rahu kaa asar hone se yaa kisi bhi prakaar se mangal kaa prabhaav ban jane se is prakaar kaa vyakti yatayaat kaa sipaahi ban jaataa he, use jindagi ke kitne hi kaam or kitne hi logon ko baari baari se paas karnaa pasta he, dasven shani vaale kii najar bahut hi tej hoti he vah kisi bhi rakhi cheez ko nahi bhuulataa he, mehnat kii kamakar khaanaa jaanata he, apane rahane ke liye jab bhi makaan aadi banaata he to keval strecchar hi banaakar khada kar paata he, uske rahane ke liye kabhi bhi badhia aaleeshaan makaan nahi ban paata he
 If the Guru is working properly, then the person becomes the one who works on the post of Executive Engineer
 shani dawaaiyon kaa kaarak bhi he, or is ghar me jataka ko scientist bhi bana detaa he, agar jaraa si bhi budh saath detaa ho to vyakti ganit ke farmule or nai khoj karne me maahir ho jaataa he
 It takes mind to do charity work, is adept at erecting and rebuilding the structure of the house, a person has two houses in his life
 doston se hameshaa chaalakiyaan hi milti he, bada bhai yaa bahin ke prati vyakti kaa rujhaan kam hi hota he

 jataka apane apane shraddhanusaar koi dandavat parikrama karata he, yaa koi paidal parikrama karata he, jo log shani dev kaa raja dasharath krit stotra kaa paath karte hue, yaa shani ke beej mantra kaa jaap karte huye parikrama karte hai, unako achche falon kii sheeghra prapti ho jaati he
 According to astrology, there are three kinds of beliefs of Saturn's Saadhesati, firstly, secondly by Chandra Lagan or Zodiac and third by Sun Lagna, in North India, the calculation of Saturn's half-sati by Chandra Lagana has been in practice since ancient times
 
 is manyata ke anusaar jab shanidev chandra raashi par gochar se apana bhraman karte hai to sadhesati maani jaati he, iskaa prabhaav raashi main aane ke tees maah pehle se or tees maah baad tak anubhav hota he
 During Sadesati, Saturn takes account of the deeds done by the native in the same way as the owner asks for the account after some time after giving full responsibility to the servant of a house, and in the case of mistake or mistake Punishment is given to the servant, similarly Shani Dev also punishes every creature
 or yahi nahi jin logon ne achche karm kiye hote hai to unako sadheshaati puraskaar bhi pradaan karti he, jaise nagar yaa gram kaa yaa shahar kaa mukhiya bana diya janaa aadi
shani kii sadhesati ke aakhyaan anek logon ke praapt hote hai, jaise raja vikramaditya, raja nal, raja harishchandr, shani kii sadhesati sant mahatmaon ko bhi pratadit karti he, jo jog ke saath bhoga ko apnaane lagate hai
 Every person must have a Sadesati once in thirty years, if this half-and-half is in Sagittarius, Pisces, Capricorn, Aquarius, it is less painful, if it will be in the fourth, sixth, eighth, and twelfth house, So the person will be unhappy, and all the happiness will be physical, mental, and economic
 They should never forget the "sapphire" in these Sadesati, if done, there is a possibility of loss of profit
 koi nayaa kaam, nayaa udyog, bhul kar bhi sadhesati main nahi karnaa chaiye, kisi bhi kaam ko karne se pehle kisi jaankaar jyotishi se jaankaree avashya kar leni chaiye
yahaan tak ki vaahan ko bhi bhuulakar is samay main nahi khareednaa chaiye, anyathaa vah vaahan sukh kaa vaahan na hokar dukhon kaa vaahan ho jaayegaa
hamane apane pichley pachchis saal ke anubhav me dekha he ki sadhesati main kitne hi udyogpatiyon kaa bura haal ho gaya, or jo crorespati the, ve rodpati hokar ek gamche main ghoomane lage
is prakaar se yah bhi naubhav kiya ki shani jab bhi chaar, chha:, aath, baarah me vicharan karegaa, to uskaa mul dhan to nasht hoga hi, kitna hi jatan kyon na kiya jaye
or shani ke is samay kaa vichaar pehle se kar liya gaya he to dhan kii raksha ho jaati he
 If caution is not taken then only remorse remains
 at: prayek manushya ko is samay kaa shani armbh hone ke pehle hi jap tap or jo vidhaan ham aage baataayenge unako kar lenaa chaiye
shani dev ke prakope se bachane ke liye ravan ne unhen apni kaid main pairon se baandh kar sar neeche kii taraf kiye hue rakhaa tha taaki shani kii vakr drushti ravan pe na pade

shani dev ne pita kii aagyaanusaar vaisaa hi kiya, or tap karne ke baad bhagwaan shankar ke vartmaan main bhi sthit shivlinga kii sthapana kii, jo aaj bhi kaashi-vishwanath ke naam se janaa jaataa he, or karm ke kaarak shani ne apane manovanchit falon kii prapti bhagwaan shankar se kii, or grahon main sarvopari pad praapt kiya

 The vowel of 'au' is different from 'au', 'au' and 'o' in pronunciation, although it is closest to 'au' in all these: hindibhashi aksar 'o' ko 'ou' uccharit karte hai
 Because both these vowels are very close and 'au' is less common in English, more confusion does not arise than this

 His mother's name was Juvaida and father's Ali Raza

 parantu vahaan bhi unka mar mitane vaala ugravadi swabhaav bana rahaa lekin sainya-shiksha main dilchaspee ke kaaran unki padhai badastoor jari rahi, usamen koi vyavdhaan nahin aayaa
 The child Mustafa was fierce but his speed in mathematics was surprising
 adhyaaapak ke blike board par sawaal likhte hi vah use munhajbani hal kar diya karata tha
 Seeing the amazing ability in it, the school's mathematics teacher Captain Mustafa Ufendi changed his name to Kamal
 uske baad hi vah kamaal pasha ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After receiving his initial military education at the primary military school in Monastir at the age of 17, he was sent to the Staff College of Kustuntunia for higher military education
 un dinon kustuntuniya main abdul hamid kii sultanate thi or uske rajiadhipati ko sultan kaha jaataa tha
 There he roamed in bad company along with studies
 kuch kaal tak uddandtapurna jivan bitaane ke baad vah vatan naamak ek gupt krantikari dal ke pehle sadsy bane or thode hi dinon baad uske netaa ho gayi
 The purpose of Vatan was to eradicate the dictatorship of the Sultan on the one hand and foreign intrigues on the other
 ek din dal kii baithak chal rahi thi ki kisi guptchar ne sultan ko khabar de di or sabake sab shadyantrakari afasar giraftaar karke jail bhej diye gayi
 According to the prevailing law, all of them could be given the death penalty, but the ill-fated Sultan feared that rebellion would not erupt in the country, so he decided to grant pardon to all
 is prakaar anya sanikon ke saath kamaal bhi kshamaadaan main chhod diye gayi
 Subsequently, the Sultan sent him to Damascus to suppress the rebellion of the Druze caste
 vahaan kamaal ne kaam to kamaal kaa hi kiya, par swabhaav ke anusaar kustantuniya waapas lautate hi unhone stambul main ek cameraa lekar vatan-o-hurriyat party kaa karyaalay kholkar usamen aazaadee kii gupt sanstha kaa kaary armbh kar diya
 Meanwhile, he came to know that there was going to be an open rebellion against the Sultan in Macedonia

 Although Kamal was able to stay in Salonika for a very short time, he understood well that it would be better to make Salonika the center of rebellion, so after a lot of efforts, in 1908 he got Salonika transferred
 yahan anwar ke netritv main do saal pehle hi ekta or pragati samiti ke naam se ek krantikari dal kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 Kamal immediately became its member, but she was not made up of the leaders of the party
 phir bhi ve samiti kaa kaam nirantar karte rahe
 One leader of this party, Niazi, revolted against the Turkish government with only a few hundred men
 yadhyapi thi to yah badi morrkhtaa kii baat, parantu chunki sara desh taiyaar tha, isliye jo sena usase ladane ke liye bheji gayi thi, vah bhi anwar se ja mili
 Thus Anwar cheered in the country
 ab sah sammilit sena rajdhani par akraman karne kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 The Sultan also made some governance reforms in those days
 phir bhi vidroh kii shaktiyaan apana kaam karti raheen, par jab vidroh safal ho chukaa tab sultan abdul hamid ne sena ke kuch logon ko yathesht ghoose dekar apane saath mila liya, jisase sainikon ne vidroh karke apane afasaron ko maar daalaa or phir ek baar islam, sultan or khaliph kii jai ke naare buland hue
 Anwar was in Berlin these days
 vah jaldi hi laute or unhone abdul hamid ko gaddi se utaar kar anek pratikriyaavaadi netaaon kii phaansi par chadha diya
 In this way administrative power came into the hands of Anwar's revolutionary committee
 aam janata ko digbhramit karne ke liye sultan ke bhanje ko singhaasana par bitha diya gaya
 Here Kamaal Pasha continued to plot against Anwar because in his view Anwar was undoubtedly idealistic but more impractical
 baavjood is sabake anwar ne us samay hone vaale videshi akramanon ko ek ke baad ek lagaataar vifal kiya isse janata main anwar kii khyaati or adhik badi
 Anwar then embarked on the task of making his all-islamic dream come true and the first thing he did for it was to hand over the responsibility of organizing the Turkish army to a German general
 kamaal ne iske viruddh yah kehete hue aandolan prarambh kiya ki yah to turki jati kaa apmaan he
 On this, Kamal was sent to Sofia by making a military ambassador
 isi bich mahayuddh chhid gaya
 Anwar could not succeed in this, but Kamal thwarted the British trick of conquering Kustantunia in a battle, and then his victory continued to prevail
 phir bhi mahayuddh main turki haar gaya
 Working hard day and night, he kept agitating against foreigners
 1920 main sevra kii sandhi kii ghoshnaa hui parantu isaki sharten itani kharaab thim ki kamaal ne fouran hi ek sena taiyaar kar kustuntuniya par akraman kii taiyaari kii
 Meanwhile, Greece attacked Turkey and launched an army at Smyrna which started moving towards the great center of Angara
 ab to kamaal ke liye badi samasya paidaa ho gai, kyonki is yuddh main yadi ve haar jate to aage koi sambhaavna na rahati
 So they fought the war with great preparation, as a result of which the Greek army gradually had to retreat
 is bich france or rus ne bhi kamaal ko gupt rup se sahaayta dena shuru kiya
 In a few days the Greeks were driven out
 greekon ko bhagane ke baad hi angrejon ke haath se baaki hisse nikaalane kaa prashn tha
 The country was with them, in addition, Britain was no longer ready to fight
 is kaaran yah samasya bhi sulajh gai
 Kamal declared the country democratic and became the first President himself
 ab rajya lagbhag nishkantak ho chukaa tha, par mullaon kii ore se unka nirantar virodh ho rahaa tha
 Kamal started campaigning against Islam in government newspapers
 ab to dharmik netaaon ne unke viruddh fatve jari kar diye or yah kahana shuru kiya ki kamaal ne angora main striyon ko parde se baahar nikaal kar desh main aadhunik nrity kaa prachaar kiya he, jisamen purush striyon se satakar naachte hai, iskaa ant hona chahie
 This voice was raised from every mosque
 tab kamaal ne 1924 ke march main khilaafat pratha kaa ant kiya or turki ko dharm-nirpeksh raashtra ghoshit karte hue ek vidheyak sansad main rakhaa
 Most parliamentarians opposed it, but Kamal threatened them with a tight end
 unki is dhamkee kaa purajor asar hua or vidheyak paarit ho gaya
 But the fire of insurgency within the mullahs kept on burning
 kamaal ke kai bhootpurv saathi mullaon ke saath mil gayi the
 These people also took money from foreign capitalists
 kamaal ne ek din inke mukhya netaaon ko giraftaar kar phaansi par chadha diya
 Kamal saw that hanging only will not do, the country has to be educated modernly and not only the old customs, the dress etc
 has to be abolished
 kamaal ne pehla hamalaa turki topi par kiya
 It revolted, but Kamal sent an army
 iske baad inhone islamic kanoonon ko hataakar unke sthaan par ek nai samhita sthapit kii jisamen switzarland, germany or italy kii sab acchhee-acchhee baaten shaamil thim
 Multiple marriages were outlawed
 iske saath hi patiyon se yah kaha gaya ki ve apni patniyon ke saath dhoron kii tarah-vyavhaar na karke barabari kaa bartaav rakhen
 Everyone was given the right to vote
 sevaaon main ghoose lenaa nishiddh kar diya gaya or ghoosekhoron ko bahut kadi sajaayen di garin
 The curtain was lifted from the women's attire and the men began to wear suits leaving the old fashioned passages
 isse bhi bada sudhaar yah tha ki arabi lipi ko hataakar puure desh main roman lipi kii sthapana kii gayi
 Kamal himself went on the streets and taught Turkish language in Roman alphabet
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki sara turki sangathit hokar ek ho gaya or algaav kii bhaavana samaapt ho gayi
 Simultaneously, Kamal organized the Turkish army in a very modern manner
 is prakaar turk jati kamaal pasha ke kaaran aadhunik jati bani
 By the time Mustafa Kamal Ataturk died on the 10th of November, 1938, his name as the creator of modern Turkey had shone like the sun in the world
 vaise to kamaal pasha ke jivan main chaar striyon ke saath uskaa prem prasang chalaa kintu shaadi usne keval latifi ussaki se hi kii
 Although she did not have any children, and she died childless

 Then it was thought that somewhere like BA Intermediate, Subhash studied very diligently and passed the BA examination in the first class in 1919
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main unka doosraa sthaan tha
 The father wished that Subhash should become ICS, but given his age, he had to pass this exam only once
 unhone pita se choubees ghante kaa samay yah sochane ke liye maanga taaki ve pariksha dene yaa na dene par koi antim nirnay le saken
 He kept awake all night wondering what to do
 aakhir unhone pariksha dene kaa faisla kiya or 15 sitambar 1919 ko england chale gayi
 Unable to get admission in any London school for exam preparation, Subhash somehow got admission for studying Tripas examination of mental and moral sciences in Kits William Hall
 isse unke rahane va khaane kii samasya hal ho gayi
 Recently, taking admission was an excuse to show the real purpose by passing in ICS
 so unhone 1920 main variyata suchi main chauthaa sthaan praapt karte hue paas kar lee
 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS? Wrote a letter of resignation from the ICS to the Secretary of India ES Montague on 22 April 1921

 Inspired by the work of the freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das of Kolkata, he wanted to work with Subhash Dasbabu
 england se unhone dasababu ko khat likhakar unke saath kaam karne kii ichha prakat kii
 According to the advice of Rabindranath Thakur, on his return to India, he first went to Mumbai and met Mahatma Gandhi
 mumbai main gandhi ji manibhawan main nivas karte the
 Gandhiji and Subhash met for the first time on 20 July 1921
 gandhi ji ne unhen kolkata jaakar dasababu ke saath kaam karne kii salaah di
 Subhash then came to Kolkata and met Dasbabu
 un dinon gandhi ji ne angrez sarkaar ke khilaaf asahyog andolan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Dasbabu was leading this movement in Bengal
 unke saath subhash is aandolan main sahabhaagi ho gayi
 In 1922, Dasbabu founded the Swaraj Party under the Congress
 vidhansabha ke andar se angrez sarkaar kaa virodh karne ke liye kolkata mahapalika kaa chunaav swaraj party ne ladakar jeeta or dasababu kolkata ke mahayor ban gayi
 He made Subhash the chief executive officer of the municipality

 All the routes in Kolkata were changed to English names and given Indian names

 Very soon Subhash became an important youth leader of the country

 When the Simon Commission came to India in 1928, the Congress showed it black flags
 kolkata main subhash ne is aandolan kaa netritv kiya
 To answer the Simon Commission, the Congress entrusted the task of framing the future Constitution of India to the eight-member Commission
 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash

 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 Under the chairmanship of Subhash, the Congress decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash established his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 Subhash started a fast in jail to force the government to release him
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the
 He went missing during this journey
 is din ke baad ve kabhi kisi ko dikhaayi nahin diye
 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about the existence of Netaji from Gumnami Baba of Faizabad to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all these is doubtful
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention
 kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh de diya he
 This petition has been filed by the government organization India Smile

 All references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed after the demolition
 aatmasamarpan ke uparant japan chaar-paanch varshon tak america ke paanvon tale karahata rahaa
 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years
 navambar 1945 main dilli ke laal kile main aaazaad hind fouj par chalaaye gayi mukademe ne netaji ke yash main varnanaatit vruddhi kii or ve lokapriyata ke shikhar par ja pahunche
 Despite the lawful propaganda by the British and Subhash's opposition by the then major political parties, after that lawsuit that shook the whole country, the mothers began to take pride in naming their sons 'subhash'
 ghar–ghar main rana pratap or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke jod par netaji kaa chitra bhi dikhaai dene laga
 Netaji's attempt to liberate India from the clutches of the British through the Azad Hind Fauj was not directly successful but had far-reaching consequences
 san 1946 ke nausena vidroh iskaa udhaaharan he
 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India
 aaazaad hind fouj ko chhodkar vishwa-itihaas main aisa koi bhi drushtaant nahin miltaa jahaan tees-pantis hajaar yudhbandiyon ne sangathit hokar apane desh kii aazaadee ke liye aisa prabal sangharsh chhedaa ho
 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses
 swatantryavir saavarkar ne swatantrata ke uparant desh ke krantikariyon ke ek sammelan kaa aayojan kiya tha or usamen adhyaksh ke asana par netaji ke tailchitr ko asin kiya tha

 In addition to his incomplete autobiography, An Indian Traveler, he also wrote an entire book in two volumes, India's Struggle, which was first published from London
 yah pustak kaaphi prasiddh hui thi
 Although his autobiography remained incomplete, he had a desire to complete it, which is evident from the plan made on the first page of the original manuscript

 Its first volume in Hindi was published in 1982 and then overall literature in these three languages continued to be published

 Sugat Bose was also associated with the compilation and publication work of this 'samagra Vaamay' and the last two volumes were published mainly due to the sad demise of Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose in the editing of Sugat Bose itself
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke pratham khand main unki 'aatmakatha' ke saath kuch patron kaa prakaashan hua he or dwitiya khand main unki suprasiddh pustak 'bharat kaa sangharsh' kaa prakaashan hua he

 dev-d is a Hindi romantic drama film released on 6 February 2009
 film kaa lekhan or nirdesan anuraag kashyap ne kiya he
 The film is the modern version of Sharad Chandra Chattopadhyay's periodical Bengali novel Devdas
 iske alaava is upanyaas par aadhaarit anya filmein pi si bruva, bimal roy or sanjay lila bhansaali bana chuke hai
 The film was well received by critics and the public and for the manner in which it introduced itself, it was considered one of the path breaking films in Hindi
 dev ek amir punjabi vyavsaayee kaa betaa he
 He and Paro have been attracted to each other since childhood
 lekin dev, ek asurakshit ugr swabhaav kaa vyakti hone ke kaaran, uske prati apana sneh ore suraksha darshane ke bajaay faaltu baton par paro ko pareshaan karata he
 The film is based on contemporary Punjab and Delhi where family ties are ignored in the face of paternal traditions and marriages have become merely a game of ability and "respect"
 dev ko ucch shiksha ke liye landan bhej diya jaataa he, jab uske pita ko yah mahasoos hota he ki unka betaa itnaa bighad gaya he
 But, when away from each other, the love between Paro and Dev begins to blossom like a flower
 yani ve mahasoos karte hai ki ve ek duusare se pyaar karte hai
 Dev reaches Chandigarh to meet Paro
 pyaar karne kaa yah prayaas kuch andhere hasya palon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Such seeds of doubt are sown at this time, from which this couple will never recover in their life
 jab dev paro ke bare main afvaahen sunata he, vah un par turant vishwaas kar letaa he or paro ko chhod detaa he
 This creates a suspicion between them and necessarily brings such a male feeling about how a woman should behave sexually
 paro jab yah sunati he ki dev ne uskaa apmaan kiya he, vah use chhod kar laut aati he or uske mata-pita ne uske liye jise chunaa he, usase shaadi karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaati he
 On the day of her wedding, she realizes that these rumors were false
 lekin apane ahankaar ke kaaran, vah apni galati ko sweekaar nahin karata he or use kisi or se shaadi karne detaa he
 Chanda's entry, this section explains the infamous sex MMS scandal of Delhi
 jab uske pita apni beti kii khoyi pratishtha se apamaanit mahasoos karte hai, ve aatmahatya kar lete hai
 He is abandoned by his family
 film main yah darshaya gaya he ki kaise vah apane aap ko ek nirdosh schuli chaatra se ek veshya main tabdeel kar leti he
 Although Chanda is not a prostitute by profession, she is not completely isolated
 mujra pradarshit karne ke bajaay, vah lokapriy america shrinkhalaa ke ashleel drishyon kaa pradarshan karti he
 One thing that makes him different is that he has not left his studies for the profession and his exit door is also open
 dev paro kii shaadi se bahut pareshaan ho jaataa he or sharaab or nashile padaarthon kaa seven karne lagata he
 He leaves Chandigarh in search of his lost love and comes to Delhi, makes every effort to escape his father
 kuch maah baad, dev aadhi raat ko paro ke pati ko phone karata he, jiske baad paro dev se milane jaati he
 Paro has accepted her fate, but her heart still beats for her childhood sweetheart
 uskaa pyaar hameshaa dekhbhaal main badal jaataa he
 On the other hand, Dev demands more than love - especially physical love - and this is where his luck does not support him
 paro kaa yah maananaa he judaai ke bajaay ki kisi or se pyaar karnaa uske liye dukh kaa kaaran he
 Ironically, her life always revolves around women
 us par dabaav he ki vah ek se apana vinaash kar le or duusare ke dwaara chhod diya jaye
 In the end, he realizes that he was wrong and that he has never truly loved Paro
 vah chanda ke paas laut jaataa he or uske saath rahane lagata he
 The film's original idea was suggested by Abhay Deol to Anurag Kashyap, who worked on the screenplay with Vikramaditya Motwani and gave the film a youthful feel "using news headlines about Generation X"
 It was produced by Ronnie Screwvala, its shooting took place at many places including Paharganj in central Delhi
 anuraag kashyap devdas sheershak ke pichley 9 sanskarnon main se kisi kaa bhi rimek nahin karnaa chaahate the
 His version is a modern form of the 1917 original excellent novel by Sharatchandra Chattopadhyay

 Talking about Dev's role and the story, Abhay Deol told Radio Sargam, "the majority of the story is from a book i read in English
 " maine is bhoomika ko kitaab main di gayi meri vyakhya ke anusaar nibhaayaa he
 His character was contemporary, he was quite urban in many ways, he is lost and spoiled somewhere in the surrounding environment, his personality is extreme and he is addictive

 But according to sources, UTV had signed Abhay for three projects and the actor was busy with Kashyap's films from November 2007 to March 2008, as the program was designed to complete the film at the same time
 When the film debuted, it was rumored that UTV backed out
 us samay, nirdeshak ne is baat kaa khandan kiya ki UTV peeche hat gaya he
 He explained the reason for the delay that once his previous film Hanuman Returns is completed, after that he will be able to work on this film
 He said that they are still searching for their Chandramukhi and have signed Abhay and Mahi Gill for it
 film main baad main deree hui, kyonki unhen chandramukhi kii bhoomika ke liye abhinetri kii khoj karne main samay laga, antat iske liye unhone kaalki kochlin ko chunaa, vah sabase aakhir main audishan dene vaali ladki thi

 Havayak Brahmin is one of the Hindu Panch Dravid Vedic Brahmins

 Presently most of the hawks are residents of Karnataka state of India
 havyak, aadi shankaracharya dwaara pratipaadit advait darshan ko mante hai
 The word "havik" is derived from the word "haviga" or "havika"
 havyak shabd kaa arth he "ve jo havan kar sakaten hai
 "havan and Home are traditional religious rituals of Havayak Brahmins
 is shabd ke stotra par kai or siddhanth maujuud hai
 It is believed that the place between Konkan and Tuluva in Uttara Kannada district of ancient South India was known as "hava"
 yah sthaan havyakon kaa nivas bhi he
 It is therefore believed that this is the hymn place of the word "hayavak"
 havyak brahman uttrakhand ke nainital zillaa me maujuud ahichhatra naamak sthaan ke nivasee the
 King Mayurasharma, who founded the Kadamba dynasty of South India at the end of the 9th century, invited the Hayavak Brahmins to come and reside in the present-day Karnataka state
 talagunda or vardahali shilaalekh se yah malum hota he ki kadamb rajvansh ne havyak brahmanon ko ahichhatra se shahi anushthan karne hetu bulawaaya tha
 Many earlier family families were inhabited by Hagunda and Banavasi
 mayoorasharma dwaara havyak pariwaron ko karnataka me bulaae jane kii kriya ko ek shilaalekh me darz kiya gaya he jo ab vardahali me sthapit he
 Most Havayak Brahmins today follow the ideas and customs of the Ramachandrapur Math and Swarnavali Math

 Where the majority of devotees are seen entering betel nut, paddy, kelash and coconut trade, some hayak Brahmins take the Vedasastra and obtain the position of Pandit

 Many subbodies of Havayak Kannada also exist which are distributed by region
 havyak bhashaa me kai shabd pracheen kannada se lee gai he jiske kaaran hi samaanya kannada vaasi is bhashaa ko thik rup se samaj nahi pate
 Havayak language is also considered to be quite old and ancient like Hagenada
 mana jaataa he ki is bhashaa kaa nirmaan bhi havyak brahmanon ne hi kiya tha
 But due to no evidence of any kind on this subject, the hymn of this language is also mysterious like many things in India
 vishesh rup se dakshin kannada tathaa uttar kannada ke havyak bhashaa me stri ling ke jagah par tatast ling kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Careful study of this fact reveals some interesting points
 jahaan ek ore uttar bharat ke bhashaaon me tatast ling ke upyog ki kami dikhaai padati he, duusari ore adhikansh dravid bhashaaon me tatast ling kaa baari upyog ke pramaan milte he
 From this it can be inferred that the language language originated in the adi-dravidian era, which makes this language ancient
 parantu karnataka me kuch jagahon me havyak brahman havigannada kaa upyog nahi karte
 The Havayak Brahmin is a sub-caste of the Hindu Brahmin caste who follows the Advaita Vedanta, the creation of Adi Shankara

 Radha, as the mother of the village, inaugurates the canal and looks back at her past when she was a new bride
 radha or shaamu kii shaadi kaa karcha radha kii saas ne sukhilala se udhaar lekar uthaaya tha
 Due to this, Radha gets trapped in the never ending cycle of poverty and hard work

 The film reaches back years when both Radha's remaining sons, Birju and Ramu, are now grown up
 birju apane bachapan main sukhilala ke bartaav kaa pratishodh lene ke liye gaanv kii ladakiyon ko chhedana shuru kar detaa he, khaas kar sukhilala kii beti ko
 In contrast, Ramu is of a very calm nature and soon marries
 haalanki ab vah ek pita he par uski patni jald hi parivaar main maujuud garibi kaa shikaar ho jaati he
 Birju's anger finally takes a dangerous form and on the instigation strikes Sukhilala and her daughter
 use gaanv se nikaal diya jaataa he or vah ek daaku ban jaataa he
 On the day of Sukhilala's daughter's wedding, he comes back for revenge and tries to kill Sukhilala and drive her daughter away
 radha, jisane yah vaada kiya tha ki birju kisi ko koi haani nahin pahunchayegaa, birju ko goli maar detii he jo uski banhon main dam tod detaa he

 According to research published in the respected journal Nature, this civilization is at least 8000 years old
 yah hadappa sabhyataa or 'sindhu-saraswati sabhyataa' ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he
 It developed along the banks of the Indus and Ghaghghar / Hakra
 mohenjodaro, kalibanga, lothal, dholavira, rakhigadhi or hadappa iske pramukh kendra the
 In December 2014, Bhirdana is considered the oldest discovered city of the Indus Valley Civilization so far
 british kaal main hui khudaayiyon ke aadhaar par puratatvvetta or itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki yah atyant viksit sabhyataa thi or ye shahar anek baar based or ujde hai
 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government
 isi kram main 1861 main elexander kaningham ke nirdesan main bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 In 1904, John Marshall was made director general of the Indian Archaeological Department by Lord Curzon
 flit ne is puraani sabhyataa ke bare main ek lekh likhaa
 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya
 This civilization was spread in the Indus River Valley, hence it was named Indus Valley Civilization
 pratham baar nagaron ke udai ke kaaran ise pratham nagarikaran bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the use of bronze for the first time, it is also called Bronze Civilization
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke 1400 kendron ko khoja ja sakaa he jisamen se 925 kendra bharat main he
 80 percent of the site is in the vicinity of the Saraswati River and its tributaries
 abhi tak kul khojon main se 3 pratishat sthalon kaa hi utkhanan ho paaya he
 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state
 inamen se aadhe darjanon ko hi nagar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh
 dono hi sthal vartmaan pakistan main hai
 Both were 483 km away from each other and were connected by the Indus River
 teesraa nagar mohen jo dado se 130 kimi dakshin main chanhudado sthal par tha to chauthaa nagar gujarat ke khambhaat kii khadi ke upar lothal naamak sthal par
 Apart from this, Kalibanga in the northern part of Rajasthan and Banavali in Hisar district of Haryana

 The mature state of this culture is also seen in the coastal towns of Sutkagandor and Surkotada

 The North Harappan stage has also been found at Rangpur and Rosadi sites in the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat

 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks
 paas ke kamare main ek bada sa kuna he jiskaa pani nikaal kar hoj main daalaa jaataa tha
 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide
 hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai
 15
23 m each Long and 6
09 m
 Is wide and some one meter from the river bank
 in baarah ikaiyon kaa talakshetra lagbhag 838
125 varg me
 he jo lagbhag utana hi hota he jitna mohan jodado ke kothaar kaa
 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros
 yahan ke nagaron main anek vyavsaay-dhandhe prachlit the
 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stage
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area
 ve chakke se parichit the or sambhawatah aajkal ke ikke jaisaa koi vaahan prayog karte the
 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-governing body like the Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze
 tambe tathaa tin milakar dhaatushilpi kaansya kaa nirmaan karte the
 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing
 harappai lipi kaa pehla namoona 1853 isvi main mila tha or 1923 main puri lipi prakaash main ai parantu ab tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier
 vyapaar ke liye unhen maap taul kii aavashyaktaa hui or unhonen iskaa prayog bhi kiya
 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
