 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Gross domestic product ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 Gross domestic product or GDP or GDP is a basic measure of the economic performance of an economy, the market value of all final goods and services within a nation's range in a year
 GDP ko teen prakaar se paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jinamein se sabhi avadharanatmak rup se samaan hai
 First, it is equal to the total expenditure incurred for all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period
 doosraa, yah ek desh ke bheetar ek avadhi main sabhi udyogon ke dwaara utpaadan kii prayek avasthaa par kul vardhit mulya or utpaadon par sabsidi rahit kar ke yoga ke baraabar he
 Third, it is equal to the sum of the income generated by production in the country over a period — that is, the amount of workers' compensation, taxes on production and subsidized imports and gross operating surplus
 GDP ke maapan or maatr nirdhaaran kaa sabase aam tarika he kharch yaa vyay vidhi : "gross" means the depreciation of capital share has not been subtracted from GDP
 yadi shuddh nivesh ko uparyukt sameekaran main sakal nivesh ke sthaan par lagaaya jaae, to shuddh gharelu utpaada kaa sutara praapt hota he
 Consumption and investment in this equation are expenditure on final goods and services
 sameekaran kaa niryaat - aayaat vaala bhaag, gharelu rup se utpann nahin hone vaale vyay ke bhaag ko ghataakar or ise phir se gharelu kshetra main jod kar samyojit karata he
 Economists like to divide the term general consumption into two parts; Private consumption and public sector spending
 saidhantik macroiconomics main kul upbhog ko is prakaar se vibhajit karne ke do phaayde hai: Africa · North America South America · Asia Europe · Oceania vyashti arthshaastra · samshti arthshaastrarthik vichaaron kaa itihaaskaryapranali · mukhyadhara or vidharmik Mathematical Economics · Game Theory Optimization · Computational Economics · Experimental Statistics · National Accounts vyavahaaravaadi · saanskrithik · vikasvadivruddhi · vaikasik · itiharasntarrashtriya · aarthik vyavasthamudrik or vittiya arthshaastraaarvjanik or kalyaan arthshaastraswasthya · shiksha · kalyaan janasankhyikee · shram · prabandhkiyavyavsaayik · suchanaudyogic sanghathan · kanoonkrushi · prakritik sansaadhanparyaavaran · paristhitikshahari · gramin · kshetreey · bhugol Magazines · Publications Categories · Profile · Economist prayek char C, I, g or x − m jaisaa ki upar diya gaya he) 'is represented by y in the context of a GDP graph
 ek ghar ke dwaara nae awaas par vyay karnaa bhi nivesh main shaamil hai
 Contrary to its colloquial meaning, 'investment' in GDP does not mean the purchase of financial products
 vittiya utpaadon ke kray ko 'bachat' ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, nivesh ke rup main nahin
 The distinction is clear: if money is converted into goods or services, it is investment; But, if you buy a bond or a share of a stock, this transfer payment is set aside from GDP
 to stock or band paroksh rup se GDP ko prabhavit karte hai
 Although such purchases are commonly called investments, from a total economic point of view it is simply an exchange of contracts and not a part of actual production or GDP
 isamen koi hastantaran bhugtan jaise saamaajik suraksha yaa berogari ke laabh shaamil nahin hai
 Examples of C, I, g and NX: If you spend money to renovate your hotel, so that rates of occupancy increase, it is a private investment, but if you buy shares in a consortium to do the same It is a saving
 GDP ke maapan ke dauraan pehle vaala kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, baad vaale kaa nahin
 But, when the union makes its own spending on renewal, this expenditure will be included in GDP
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek hotel nijee ghar he, tab navinikaran vyay ko upbhog mana jayega, lekin yadi ek sarkari agency hotel ko naagarik sevaao ke ek karyaalay main badal rahi he, to navinikaran vyay ko saarvjaanik kshetra vyay kaa ek bhaag mana jayega
 If the renewal involves the purchase of a chandelier from abroad, the expenditure is also calculated as an increase in imports, so that the value of NX falls and total GDP is affected by purchasing
 yadi ek gharelu nirmaataa ko ek videshi hotel ke liye jhumar banane ke liye bhugtan kiya jaataa he, to sthiti vipareet hogi or bhugtan kii gananaa NX main kii jaaegi 
 phir se, GDP vyay ke madhyam se utpaadan kaa maapan karata he; yadi utpann jhumar ko domestic rup se karidaa gaya he, to ise GDP aankadon main shaamil kiya gaya hoga, jab ek upabhokta yaa vyaper ke dwaara ise karidaa gaya he, lekin kyonki iskaa niryaat kiya gaya tha to gharelu rup se utpann raashi ko dene ke liye gharelu rup se upbhog kii gai raashi ko "thik" karnaa jaruri he
 In
 vaastavik GDP vruddhi kii gananaa karne se arthshaastriyon ko yah nirdhaarit karne main madad milti he ki mudra kii kray kshamta main parivartan se aprabhavit rahete hue, utpaadan kam hua he yaa badhaa he
 Another way to measure GDP is to measure the total income payable in GDP income accounts
 is sthiti main, kabhi kabhi sakal gharelu utpaada ke bajaay sakal gharelu aay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 By this, the same figures should be obtained which are obtained in the above expenditure method
 = GDP 
 vyavhaar main, haalanki, jab rashtriya sankhyikeey agenciyon ne report di to maapan truti kii vajah se donon aankadon kaa maapan halkaa sa alag paaya gaya
 Using the income approach, the formula for measured GDP is called GDP, which is: isamen aksar adhikansh chote vyavsaay shaamil hai
 The sum total of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income and it calculates the value of GDP at factor values
 buniyadi keemton or antim keemton ke bich kaa antar kul kar or sabsidiyaan hai jinhen sarkaar ne utpaadan par lagu kiya he yaa bhugtan kiya he
 So adding subsidy-free tax on imports and production converts GDP to GDP at factor cost
 ek anya sutara is prakaar se likhaa ja saktaa he: : Where r = rent i = interest p = profit SA = statistical adjustment w = wages GDP ko sakal rashtriya utpaada, ke vipareet mana ja saktaa he, jiskaa upyog sanyukt rajya america ne 1992 tak apane rashtriya khaaton main kiya
 The difference is that GNP consists of net foreign income rather than net exports and imports
 saadhaaran rup se kaha jaae to GDP kii tulana main GNP main shuddh videshi nivesh aay shaamil hoti he

 adhik jaankaree ke liye dekhen rashtriya aay or utpaadan ke maapan Per capita GDP is not a measure of standard of living in an economy
 haalanki, aksar ise is prakaar ke sanketak ke rup main prayukt kiya jaataa he, is tark par ki sabhi naagarik apane desh ke bade hue aarthik utpaadan kaa laabh praapt karenge
 Similarly, GDP is not a measure of personal income per capita
 ek desh ke adhikansh nagarikon kii aay main kami aane par yaa an-anupaatik rup se parivartan hone par bhi GDP main vruddhi ho sakati he

 jivan str ke ek sanketak ke rup main prati vyakti GDP kaa pramukh laabh he ki ise baar baar, lagaataar or vyapak rup se mapa jaataa he; baar baar kaa arth he ki adhikansh desh GDP par jaankaree tremasik aadhaar par uplabdh karaate hai, vyapak rup se arthath isamen GDP kaa kuch maap duniya ke har desh ke liye praayogic rup se uplabdh hota he or lagaataar arthath GDP ke bheetar prayukt takneekee paribhaashaayen, deshon ke bich tulanaatmak rup se sthir rahati hai or isliye yah vishwaas bana rahata he ki prayek desh main samaan maapan kiya ja rahaa he
 a major disadvantage of using GDP as an indicator of standard of living is that it is not strictly a measure of standard of living
 GDP ek desh main aarthik gatividhi ke kisi vishisht prakaar kaa maapan karata he
 According to the definition of GDP, it is not necessary to measure the standard of living

 unhone jari rakhte hue kaha: For example, if a government is building a pyramid that has nothing for personal welfare, GDP will include it in economic growth
 In reality, however, building this pyramid will divert real wealth from wealth-producing activities, By which the production of property will be transferred

 Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg
 Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie
 He was baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church
 His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece and the Mayor of Corfu
 Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, then known as Louis Mountbatten, Marquess of Milford Haven, died in London
 Louis was a naturalised British citizen, who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War
 After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the greco-turkish War 
 The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains
 On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine I, was forced to abdicate, and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others
 The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed
 Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance
 In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life
 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip being carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box
 Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of saint-cloud in a house lent to them by his aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark
 Because he left the country as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of Greek
 In 1992 Philip said that he "could understand a certain amount of" the language
 Philip was first educated at an American school in Paris run by Donald macjannet, who described Philip as a "rugged, boisterous 


 but always remarkably polite" boy
 In 1928, he was sent to Britain to attend Cheam School, living with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire
 In the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his father moved to a small flat in Monte Carlo
 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood
 In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" Because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden
 With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun School in Scotland
 After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun
 In 1937, his sister Cecilie, her husband, her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 After leaving Gordonstoun in 1939, Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy, graduating the next year from the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the best cadet in his course
 During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side
 He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940
 Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire and in Ceylon 
 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet
 Among other engagements, Philip was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights
 He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valor
 Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia
 He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination
 In June 1942, he was appointed to the v and w class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily
 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942
 In October of the same year he became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy
 During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack
 He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed
 In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla
 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed
 In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire
 In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
 During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria, and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark
 Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen
 Speaking, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage
 The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April
 By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family, and had become a naturalized British subject
 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world
 However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some of them with Nazi connections
 After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House
 Their first two children were born: Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950
 Philip returned to the navy after his honeymoon, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty, and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich
 From 1949, he was stationed in Malta after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Checkers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet
 On 16 July 1950, he was promoted lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie
 He was promoted to commander in 1952, but his active naval career ended in July 1951
 With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada
 At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth
 On 6 February 1952, when they were in Kenya, Elizabeth's father died and she became queen
 It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom
 The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house
 The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; However, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's paternal grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who herself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor
 Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this
 The Duke privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba
 On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that the surname of male-line descendants of the Duke and the Queen who are not styled as Royal Highness, or titled as Prince or Princess, was to be mountbatten-windsor
 While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between the constitutional expert Edward Iwi and the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan 
 After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament"
 This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the Prince of Wales, except, officially, in the British parliament
 In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament, where he walks and sits beside her
 Contrary to rumours over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign
 The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide"
 During his wife's Golden Jubilee in 2002, the Duke was commended by the Speaker of the British House of Commons for his role in supporting the Queen during her reign
 The Duke of Edinburgh's time as royal consort exceeds that of any other consort in British history; However, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who died aged 101, was the consort with the longest lifespan
 In April 2008, Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for "assessment and treatment" for a chest infection, though he walked into the hospital unaided and recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later to recuperate at Windsor Castle
 In August, the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer
 Buckingham Palace, which usually refuses to comment on rumours of ill health, claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story
 The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue
 In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had "done bit"
 His wife, the Queen, gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday
 While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham, Norfolk, on 23 December 2011, the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting
 He was discharged on 27 December
 On 4 June 2012, during the celebrations in honour of his wife's Diamond Jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital, London, suffering from a bladder infection
 He was released from hospital on 9 June
 After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure
 In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital
 On 21 May 2014, the Prince appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a "minor procedure" was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day
 He is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family
 The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old
 Prince Philip would surpass this record on 15 December 2016
 Philip played polo until 1971, when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped expand; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision
 He was a keen yachts sailor, striking up a friendship in 1949 with Uffa Fox in Cowes
 He and the Queen regularly attended Cowes Week in HMY Britannia
 His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours
 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953
 In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America
 Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Peter Middleton, the grandfather of the Duke's granddaughter-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge
 He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle
 Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect 


 totally direct, no hanging about
 Strong colors, vigorous brushstrokes
" In 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of US President Jimmy Carter, Prince Philip was approached by White House butler Lynwood Westray and another unnamed butler
 Westray asked him "your majesty, would you like a cordial?", and Prince Philip responded, "i'll take one if you'll let me serve you"
 "oh my God, this had never happened before," said Westray
 "there we were standing there
 i was holding the glasses and my buddy was holding the liqueurs and we looked at each other, and i said 'if that's the only way you'll have it, we'll go along with it
' And the prince served us what he was having, and the three of us had a drink and a conversation
 It was an honour to let him do it
" Over his sixty years as royal consort, Philip has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature
 Some of them were immediately interpreted as gaffes; but other awkward observations were construed by apologists as merely odd, off-color, and often funny
 In his own words, comments attributed to Prince Philip have contributed to the perception that he is "a cantankerous old sod"
 The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of "HRH Victor Meldrew"
 For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "no wonder you are deaf listening to this row
" Later Philip wrote, "the story is largely invention
 In a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, "if you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed
" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were denied unconcerned
 Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed"
 His comment had no effect on sino-british relations, but it shaped his own reputation

 Philip has been a Freemason since 1953
 Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life
 Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles
 It was not, however, until the Queen issued Letters Patent in 1957 that Philip was again titled as a prince
 When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as Your Royal Highness, and thereafter as Sir
 The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the Order of the Garter on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding
 Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states
 The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu also worship Prince Philip as a god; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday
 Upon his wife's accession to the throne in 1952, the Duke was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, colonel-in-chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air commodore-in-chief of the Air Training Corps
 The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada, and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom
 Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia
 To celebrate his 90th birthday, the Queen appointed him Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy and Canada appointed him to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces
 saanchaa:infobox COA wide Philip is the oldest living great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria, as well as her oldest living descendant following the death of Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg on 5 May 2012
 Through his descent from the British royal family, he is in the line of succession to the thrones of the 16 Commonwealth realms
 In July 1993, through mitochondrial DNA analysis of a sample of Prince Philip's blood, British scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of Empress Alexandra of Russia's family, several decades after their 1918 massacre by the Bolsheviks
 Prince Philip was then one of two living great-grandchildren in the female line of Alexandra's mother Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the other being his sister Sophie, who died in 2001

 He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1966
 beesvin shatabdi ke bich me achche vishvavidhyalayon me bhautik shaastra ko padhaaye jane ke tareeke par vivaad chal rahaa tha
 This controversy could be carried out by a person similar to the finemen, because their status was considered by all
 unka sammaan isaliye nahin tha ki vah cyle tech me the par cyle tech duniya kaa sabase achachhaa bhautik shaastra kaa vishvavidhyalay isaliye mana jaataa tha kyonki finemen vahaan the
 Finemen taught physics to undergraduate students at cal-tech in 1961–63
 in teen saal ne bhautik shaastra ko padhaane kii nayi disha di or bhautik shaastra nayi tarah se naye vishyon ke saath padhaayaa jane laga
 These lectures were replaced by three books
 yah laal bainding me thim or 'lectures on Physics by Richard p Feynman ke naam se mashhoor huin
 Richard Phillips Fineman, was born on 11 May 1918 and died of cancer in 1988
 chhutpan main finemen aksar sochaa karte the ki vah bade hokar kya bane: vidooshak yaa vaigyanik
 Growing up, he played these two roles together
 log kehete hai ki vah itane mashhoor kyon huye par unke bare main vaigyanik thik hi kehete hai: 'finemen are historical persons, they are entitled to all the respect they received
 ' The finemen's father had his own way of telling things
 ek baar kaa kissa he ki pita or putr park me gum rahe the pita ne ek chidiya kii taraf vah ishaara karke bataaya ki yah chidiya duniya main alag-alag naamo se jaani jaati he
 It is not necessary that you know all those names, nor is it important
 par mahatvapurn yah he ki vah kya or kaise karti he
 They used to try to arouse curiosity in the mind of the child
 It is needless to say that the finemen were curious and curious since childhood
 skool main vah ganit main sabase achche or ganit team ke hero the
 But he gave up mathematics
 unhe laga ki ganit me ucch shiksha praapt karke ve dusron ko ganit padhaane ke alaava or kuch nahin kar sakate
 Thinking of doing something practical, he first went towards electrical engineering but later studied physics
 finemen ne snaatak kii shiksha masachuset institute of technology se puri kii
 He wanted to do research work there but then went to do research work in Princeton
 baad main ve kaha karte the, 'it was right
 maine vahaan janaa ki duniya bahut badi he or kaam karne ke liye bahut si acchhee jagahen hai
 ' prinkton me yuva finemen ko whealer ke saath shodh karne kaa mauka mila
 By that time, Wheeler had not received the Nobel Prize, but he had done the work on which he later received the Nobel Prize
 ve kuch aadambar priy the kuch apni ahmiyat bhi jataate the
 He allowed the finmen to meet at certain times of the day
 pehle din mulaakaat ke samay vah suut pahane the unhone apni jeb se apni sone kii viraam ghadi nikaal kar mej par rakh di taaki finemen ko pataa chal sake ki kab uskaa samay samaapt ho gaya he
 Fineman was a student at that time
 unhone ek bazaar se ek sasti viraam ghadi kharidi - unke paas manhagi ghadi kharidne ke liye paise nahin the
 On the next meeting, he kept his cheap watch near that gold watch
 whealer ko bhi pataa chalanaa chaiye ki unka samay bhi mahatvapurn he
 Wheeler understood the joke and laughed both openly
 donon ne ghadiyaan hataa lee
 Their relationship was not formal, they became friends, their talk turned into laughter and jokes into new fundamental ideas
 isi bich doosraa mahayuddh shuru ho gaya
 Atomic bomb was being made in Germany, Hitler was invincible if it was built there first
 america kii los elmos laboretary me duniya ke vaigyanik ikkatha hokar parmaanu bam banane ke liye ekajute ho gayi
 The finemen were also called there and worked there
 los elmos me suraksha kaa jimmaa sena kaa tha jinke apane niyam apane kanoon the
 This rule was often not understood by the finemen
 finemen taale kholane me maahir the
 They used to tease the officers of the Army by opening the lab's chests and leaving guesses on the paper and leaving nothing out of the chests
 yah vah keval, sena ke adhikariyon ko bataane ke liye karte the ki unki suraksha pranali kitni galat he
 During the school days, the Finemen fell in love with their classmate Arlene
 unhone shaadi tab karne kii sochi jab finemen ko koi naukari mil jaay
 Arlene received TB when the financers were doing research work
 Done, he had only a few years
 un dinon tii
bi
 kaa koi ilaaj nahin tha
 Arlene gets TB Due to this, the finmen could not even kiss him
 unhe malum tha ki arlin ke saath uske sambandh keval aadhyatmik hi rahengen
 Despite all this, the finemen wanted to marry Arlene
 unke parivaar vaale or mitra is shaadi ke khilaaf the
 He also became estranged from his father about this
 iske baavjood finemen ne arlin ke saath shaadi kii
 When the finmen were working in Los Almos, the director Robert Oppenheimer got Arlene admitted to a nearby sanatorium so that the finmen could meet her
 finemen ke los elmos rahane ke dauraan hi arlin kii mrityu ho gayi
 a picture has also been made on this event cycle, named Infinity), directed by Mathew Bourdwick
 finemen jivant the or aksar mouj masti ke liye kaam karte the
 In fun, he worked on the subject on which he received the Nobel Prize
 yah bhi ek rochak kissa he
 During the Second World War, at the Alumnus Laboratory, the alumnus befriended Beth with whom she was greatly touched
 beth kauranal main the, isaliye finemen bhi kauranal chale gayi
 One day, they were sitting in the snack house of Kaurnal
 vahaan ek vidhyaarthee ne ek plate ko phenkaa
 The plate was white in color and had a red colored symbol of the Cornel in the middle
 plate dagamagaa bhi rahi thi or gum bhi rahi thi
 It was a strange sight
 finemen iske dagamagane or ghoomane or ke bich main sambandh dhudhane lage
 It used to be very difficult mathematical equations
 isame unka bahut samay laga
 They found that both have a relation of 2: 1
 unke saathiyon ne unase kaha ki vah isame samay kyon bekaar kar rahe hai
 His answer was, 'iskaa koi mahatv nahin he main yah sab mouj masti ke liye kar rahaa hum
 ' par vah iske mahatv ke bare me thik nahin the
 When he began to research about the rotation of the electrons, he again remembered the mathematics in the staggered and rotating plate of the Cornel
 isi ne us siddhanth ko janm diya jiske kaaran unhen nobel purushkaar mila
 True, there is a lot in life that is necessary only for fun, whether it has any other importance or not - fun is a matter of importance in itself
 yadi aap mouj masti main hi apni jeevika dhurh sake to kya baat he, yadi yah nahin ho saktaa to shaayad jeevika main hi mouj masti dhurh paanaa duusari acchhee baat he
 Fineman was not only a great scientist but also a great teacher
 unhe malum tha ki apni baat duusare tak kaise pahunchaayi jaay
 The lecture hall was a theater for them, which also had drama and fireworks
 finemen ke dwaara bhautik shaastra par cyle-tech ke lekcharon kaa zikr maine is lekh ko shuruwat me kiya he
 He gave these lectures in September 1961-may 1963
 yah lacture khaas the isaliye inhen hameshaa ke liye surakshit rakhaa gaya or baad me ye teen laal kitabon ke rup main chaape gayi
 The finemen used to give only two lectures a week, the rest of the time he used to prepare these lectures
 lacture kii har line, har majaak ko pehle se soch vichaar kar rakhte the
 There were never lecture notes with him
 bas keval ek chota sa kaagaj rahata tha jisamen aage bataane ke liye kuch khaas shabd keval sanket dene ke liye rahete the
 These three years are unique in lectures on any subject, in any university in the world
 na kabhi aise huye na shaayad phir kabhi honge
 Because i do not know if such a person will come again
 finemen ke liye angreji - bekaar or darshan shaastra - tiraskrit vishay tha
 He had nothing to do with Religion
 chakkaron par baat karnaa unki phiza main nahin tha
 He always spoke directly
 unka matlab vahi hota tha jo ve kehete the
 They would get confused if their direct talk disturbed the other
 finemen ko log alag alag tarah se yaad rakhte hai - kuch log, Probably the most people remember him as the person who publicly told TV why the Challenger-accident happened
 28 janvari 1986 main chalanger spesship kaa visphot akaash main ho gaya tha, isaki jaanch karne ke liye ek kamishan baitha
 Finemen were in it as a scientist
 yah visphot, spesship main kuch ghatiya kism kaa saamaan lagane ke kaaran hua tha
 nasa's administration wanted to suppress it but scientists wanted to uncover it
 kamishan ne apane nishkarsh ko tivi ke saamne sidhe prasaaran me bataanaa shuru kiya 
 At that time on TV itself, in front of everyone, the finemen put substandard stuff inside cold water and showed why the explosion actually happened
 yah sidhaa prasaaran tha isaliye finemen kaa pradarshan roka nahin ja sakaa or yah do minute kii clip kuch ghanto ke andar duniya kii tivi par sabase zyada dikhaayi jane vaali news clip ban gayi
 Finemen often went to a restaurant in Passadina, where topless restaurants lived
 us restaraan main ve uske maalik ko bhautik shaastra bataate the or vah unhe chitrakaari
 Once, the police felt that something was wrong in the restaurant and prosecuted the restaurant owner for obscenity
 vastav main vahaan par is tarah kaa koi kaary nahin hota tha
 Many eminent people used to come to that restaurant
 The owner of the restaurant prayed to give them the most testimony
 sabane chuppe se kanni kaat lee, par finemen ne nahin
 He testified in favor of the restaurant owner and the next day appeared on the front page of newspapers as the most prominent news item
 'caltech's Feynman tells lewd case jury, he watched the girls while doing his equations' These are all worth reading

 The assets of an index fund are managed around the performance of a specific published index
 chunki, ek suchakank ke sanghatan main anavarti rup se parivartan hote rahete hai, ek suchakank fund prabandhak ek sakriy fund prabandhak ki tulana main ausatan kam vyaper karata he
 For this reason, index funds generally have less business than active manager funds and typically receive short-term capital gains that must be transferred to the shareholders
 Also, index funds do not pay the price for the selection of individual stocks
 And determine when to buy, hold, or sell personal property
 Instead, a very simple computer model is available The could recognize that funds should then be made changes to bring the chronic condition

 In the United States, Hedge funds have stored investment funds with loose sec regulation and should not be confused with mutual funds
 Some hedge fund managers have to register with the SEC as investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act

 If the fund invests primarily in stocks, it is usually exposed to similar volatility in the stock market
 kai mutual fund sheyaron ke ek se adhik varg pesh karte hai
 For example, you may have seen a fund that provides "class A" and "class B" shares
 prayek varg pratibhutiyon ke samaan samooh main nivesh karegaa ore uski nivesh kii nitiyaan ore uddeshy samaan hongen
lekin har varg kii bhinn share dharak sevaayen hongi ore / yaa bhinn shulkon ore vyayon ke saath vitaran vyavasthaaen hongin

 Some no-load index funds have expense ratios of less than 0
2% per year, while fund-managed ratios of specific actively managed expenses are about 1
5% per year
 lod funds main saamanyatya ucch vyay anupaat hote hai jab lod ke bare main vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The expense ratio is the expected annual value to the investor holding the shares of the fund
 For example, a 0
2% expense ratio on an investment of $ 100,000 implies a $ 200 annual expense, while a 1
5% expense ratio, $ 1500 annual expense
 These expenses are incurred before paying any sales commission to purchase the mutual fund

 The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the major civilizations of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world
 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times

 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established
 1904 main lard karjan dwaara jon marshall ko bhartiya puratathvik vibhaag kaa mahanideshak banaaya gaya
 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world
 is paripakv sabhyataa ke kendra-sthal punjab tathaa sindh main tha
 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage

 Only half a dozen of these can be called city

 Both places are in present-day Pakistan

 The third city was Mohen, which was 130 km south of Daro, at the site of Chanhudaro and the fourth city at a place called Lothal above the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat

 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress

 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15
23 me
 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BCE, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign

 Bull-cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and boar were reared
 harappai logon ko hathi tathaa gande kaa gyaan tha

 Different types of paintings were made on pottery with black color
 kapadaa banane kaa vyavsaay unnat avasthaa main tha
 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces

 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic
 yahan swaastik ke chitra bhi mili he
 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship

 a death occurring to work with a patient of the heart and lungs can be determined to be legally declared dead without a dead brain
 Accurate definition of death is medical, in other words more ironically advances scientific knowledge and medicine
 Becomes problematic
 mrityu yaa majboot sanket ke lakshan he ki ek vyakti ab bhi zindaa hai: The concept of death is the key event
 There are many scientific methods for conceptualizing
 udhaaharan ke liye, mastishk mrityu, vigyaan ke rup main chikitsa abhyaas main, mastishk gatividhi ke dauraan rahata he jo samay ke rup main paribhaashit maut ek bindu main
 ek maut main paribhaashit karne kii chunautiyon ke jivan se yah bhed he
 As a point in time, it appears to refer to the moment of death at which life ends
 haalanki, jab nirdhaaran maut hui he jivan or maut ke bich vaicharik simaaon sateek drawing kii aavashyaktaa he
 This is problematic because there is little consensus over how to define life
 yah sambhav he chetana ke sandarbh main jivan ko paribhaashit
 jab chetana rahata he, ek jivit jeev ke liye mar gaya he kaha ja saktaa
 is drushtikon main ullekhneey kharabi kii, haalanki, ki vahaan kai jeev jo jivit hai lekin shaayad udhaaharan ke liye nahin sachet kar rahe hai, ekal sayled jeev is drushtikon ke saath ek or samasya chetana he, jo kai alag alag aadhunik vaigyanikon, manovaigyanikon or darshanikon dwaara di gai paribhaasha ke paribhaashit karne main kiya jaataa he
 This common problem of defining death applies to the specific challenge of defining death in the context of medicine
 ke bare main kuch vighn charitra par dhyaan kendrit maut ke liye paribhaashaayen anya
 is sandarbh main "" maut keval rajya he jahaan kuch rah gai he, jaise, jivan varnan karata he
 Thus, "the definition of life together defines death
" aitihaasik, ek insaan kii mrityu ke kshan ko paribhaashit karne kaa prayaas samasyagrast kiya gaya he
 And arrest is defined as a once-off heart beat, but the development of CPR and early defibrillation is insufficient definition provided that breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted
 Incidents of death which were now associated in any previous condition without killing everyone in a functioning heart or lung, can make pacemakers and prosthetic organ transplants, sometimes in combination with a continuous life support device
 aaj, ek mrityu ke kshan kii paribhaasha, aavashyak jahaan doctoron or coroners aamtaur par naidanik mrit baari karne ke liye mastishk "mrityu" yaa jaivik "maut hone ke ek vyakti ke rup main paribhaashit karne ke liye", logon ko mrit mana jaataa he jab unke mastishk gatividhi vidyut rahata he
 It is believed that an end of electrical activity is also a sign of an end of consciousness

 sone ke maamle main, anada antar kar sakate hai aasaani se bataata he However, the category "brain death" is seen by some scholars to be problematic
 For example, Dr
 Franklin Miller, senior faculty member of the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes, "since the 1990s, however, humans were increasingly being challenged by scholars, based on evidence of death
" The equations of brain death with respect to the array of biological functioning exhibited by patients correctly conditioned on mechanical ventilation for a considerable period of time
 Placed as being identifies maintained the ability to keep these patients to maintain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and most dramatically, to gestate fetuses for " un logon ko banaae rakhane kii maut he ki praantastha-ke nav keval ke liye aavashyak he kabhi kabhi mastishk chetana kaa tark he ki keval vidyut gatividhi ko paribhaashit karnaa chahie ho saktaa he jab mana jaataa he
 Ultimately it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function, brain death as a whole
 Personality thinking is the realization of all hope for human recovery and then medical technology is gone
 haalanki, vartmaan main, main sabase adhik maut roodhiwaadee paribhaasha ke sthanon puure mastishk gatividhi main vidyut aparivartaneey samaapti ke rup main praantastha-nav virodh karne ke liye bas main he apanaaya gaya he maut kaa nirdhaaran udhaaharan ke liye vardi sanyukt rajya america adhinium he 2005 main, terry schhvo maamle raajnneeti ke america saamne laayaa sawaal karne ke liye jeevika or kritrim mastishk mrityu hota he Whole brain parameters may also be complicated by resolution of brain death

 In the United States, a person is legally dead if a death certificate or a statement of death is obtained by a medical practitioner
 Various legal consequences follow the death, including the removal from the person in legal terminology which is called parsonhud

" ) Being declared dead by many physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes about several days later when your coffin, or embalming process are started
 Since the mid-18th century, there was a wave of fear being publicly buried in a live accident, and uncertainty about the symptoms of death had also caused much debate to be made to test for signs of life
 Suggestions were the first burials
 Punchers applied to the mouth of the rectum ranging from pepper and vinegar to pouring
 Writing in 1895, physician JC Ousele claimed that Tate

 Uddālaka was one of the greatest philosophers of the Upanishad era
 ye gautam gotreey aruni rishi ke putr the or isiilie 'aaruni' ke naam se vishesh prakhyat hai
 In the Mahabharata, he has been described as a disciple of the sage Dhaumya and an ideal disciple for his singular gurus service
 
 It is generally believed that the Greek Saint Thales was the pioneer of science

 Many students lived in Rishi Dhaumya's ashram
 vah unhen puri tatparta se padhaate, saath hi unki kadi pariksha bhi lete rahete the
 In these exams, different criteria were set and it would be seen how loyal the student was to the learning and master
 ek din musaladhar varsha ho rahi thi
 The Guru told one of his students Aruni, 'son! The water is being drained out due to the breaking of the ridge of the field, so go and tie the weir
 ' aaruni tatkaal uth khadaa hua or khet kii ore chal diya
 The flow of water was fast
 aaruni ne mitti jamaane kii koshish kii par bahaav rukaa nahin
 Seeing no solution, Aruni lay down at that place
 is prakaar usne pani ko roak diya magar bahaav or varsha ke veg se vah behosh ho gaya
 Even after many nights passed, when he did not return, Dhaomya was worried
 vah khet par use dhundne pahunche
 On seeing it, Aruni stopped the water and lay near the ridge
 dekhte hi guruji bhavvibhor ho gaye
 a detailed discussion of the spiritual ideas of Aruni has been done in a very interesting way in the Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads
 tatvavettaon ke itihaas main aaruni kaa pad yajyavlky ke hi samakaksh mana jaataa he jo inke shishy hone ke atirikt upanishatkaaleen darshanikon main ni:sanshay sarvshereshth maane jate hai
 Regarding psychological facts, Aruni believes that for the main purpose of sleep is 'labor', and in the state of sleep, the organism takes on communion with the soul
 mrityukalin chetana ke vishay main aaruni kaa kathan he ki jab manushya marataa he, tab uski vaakman main antarleen ho jaati he; ananthar man praan main, praan tej main tathaa ant main tej devtaa main antarleen ho jaataa he 
 Yajnavalkya has taken this theory from here and has elaborated it
 tatvagyan ke vishay main aaruni ke siddhant ko ham 'pratyayvaadee' addhait kaa naam de sakate hai, kyonki inaki drushti main advait hi ekmaatr sat tathaa tathy he
 The theory of Aruni is the connotation of metaphysical sentence, which he explained and proved by his son Shvetketu through many entertaining illustrations
 'idan sarv tat satyam sa aatma tatvamasi shwethaketo'-aaruni ke advaitvaad kaa yah mahneey mantra he 
 The basic element is the 'sat' form, not the non-discrete form, because there can be no origin of any kind from discrete
 yah sat apane main se pehle agni ko, peeche jal ko tathaa ant main prithvi ko isi kram se utpann karata he
 This 'trinity' element of the universe is the self-realized principle of Aruni
 vishwa ke prayek dravya main ye teenon tatv vidyaman rahete hai
 All substances are immaterial
 padaarthon apeksha tatwon kii satyata sarvatha maanya he or in tatwon kii apeksha satyatar he vah sat jo inkaa mul kaaran he 
 It is an astral and base microcosm in all systems of the world
 iskaa purna gyaan acharya ke dwaara di gai shiksha ke dwaara or shraddha ke dwaara praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 'acharyavan Purusho Veda' = Only the man who is assigned by the Guru knows the ultimate element; This sermon of Aruni is the cornerstone of gurutva
 aatma vishwa ke prayek padaarth main usee prakaar vyaapt rahata he, jis prakaar us jal ke prayek kan main lavan vyaapt rahata he jisamen vah daalaa jaataa he 
 This spiritual vision of Uddālaka Aruni is a complete reflection of the monotony and comprehensiveness of the soul
