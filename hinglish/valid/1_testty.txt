"alankarisarvasv" ke tikaakar samudrbandh ne is shaastra ke anek sampradaayon kii vishistataa kii sundar vivaran prastut kiya he
 Different sects originated in different centuries by giving importance and emphasis to different parts of poetry
 mukhya sampradaayon kii sankhya chah maani ja sakati he- According to their names, these sects have accepted Tattatta, the soul of poetry
 ras sampradaay ke ke mukhya acharya bharat muni hai jinhone nateras kaa hi mukhyat: vishleshan kiya or us vivaran ko avaantar aacharyon ne kavyras ke liye bhi pramanik mana
 The principal Acharyas of the Alankara sect are Bhamah, Dandi, Udbhat and Rudrat
 is mat main alankaar hi kavy kii aatma mana jaataa he
 This sect is adopted as the oldest and most influential in the history of this scripture
 reeti sampradaay ke pramukh acharya vaaman hai jinhone apane "kaavyalankarsutra" main reeti ko spasht shabdon main kavy kii aatma mana he 
 Dandi had also given great poignant reviews of the common types of rituals - Vaidarbhi and Gaudi - in his "kavyadarsha", but in his view, poetry has a predominance of ornamentation
 vakrokti sampradaay kii udbhaavna kaa shrey acharya kuntak ko he jinhone apane "vakroktijivit" main "vakrokti" ko kavy kii aatma sweekaar kiya he
 Anandavardhan inaugurated the sound community in his epochal treatise "dhwanyalok" and it was founded by Abhinav Gupta in the Lochan Tika of Dhwanyalok
 mammat, ruyyak, hemchandra, piyushvarsh jayadev, vishwanath kaviraj, panditraj jagannatha --isi sampradaay ke pratishthit acharya hai
 Kshemendra, the eminence of the justification sect, adopted the opinion of ancient masters like Bharata, Anandavardhana, etc
, and adopted the justification element as a major element in poetry and distinguished it as an independent sect
 alankarishastra is prakaar lagbhag do sahasr varshon se kavyatatvon kii samiksha karata aa rahaa he
 This scripture has been guiding critics and poets in reviewing poetry and writing poetry since very ancient times
 yah kavy ke antarang or bahirang donon kaa vishleshan badi maarmikata se prastut karata he
 For the reviewers, there are four very important accounts of the poetry of Alankasastra, which have been critically presented in many texts by Indian literary mystics, with detailed deliberation, intimate examination and practical use
 ye mahneey kavy tatv hai--auchity, vakrokti, dhwani tathaa ras
 The element of justification is the most widespread theory in folk practice and in poetry
 auchity ke aadhaar par hi rasamimasaa kaa prasaad khadaa hota he
 This quote from Anandavardhana epitomizes the fundamental fact in the review that there is no other reason for rashes except impropriety, and the appropriation of justification is the secret of the rasa - vakrokti lokatikrant gochar vachan ke vinyas kii saahitiyik sangya he
 Any utterance results in the juxtaposition of curvature as a juxtaposition of poetry
 europe main kroche dwaara nirdisht "abhivyanjanawad" vakrokti ko bahut kuch sparsh karanevaala kavyatatv he
 The element of sound is the third major component of Sanskrit criticism
 hamaare aalochakon kaa kahana he ki kavy utana hi nahin prakat karata jitna hamaare kaanon ko prathit hota he, pratyut vah nitant gudh arthon ko bhi hamaare hriday tak pahunchaane kii kshamta rakhata he
 This beautiful captivating meaning is manifested by a specific vocabulary called "vyƒÅnjana" and thus the expression is called by the word acoustic
 saubhaahgya kii baat he ki angreji ke maanya aalochak abrcrambi tathaa richards kii drushti is tatv kii ore abhi-abhi aakrisht hui he
 The metaphysics of statehood is the captivating fruit of the psychological review of Indian critics
 kavy alokik anand ke unmilan main hi charitaarth hota he chaahe vah kavy shravy ho yaa drishy
 The heart of the poem is the poignant and graceful aspect of poetry rather than the aesthetic, the Indian criticism is absolutely insistent on this fact
 bhartiya aalochana jivan kii samasya ko sulajhane vaale darshan kii chaanbin se kathampi paranmukh nahin hoti or is prakaar yah paashchaatya jagat ke teen shastron-- "poetics", "retariks" tathaa "asthetics"- kaa pratinidhitiv akele hi apane aap karti he
 In antiquity, seriousness and psychological analysis, it is more important than Western criticism; There can be no two opinions about this

 He inspected the trade and routes and returned to Cairo

 Information was exchanged and Kovilha headed south to Ethiopia
 vahaan se wo lautnaa chahta tha lekin uske vishwa-gyaan ko dekhakar raja sikandar ne apana salaahkaar niyukt kiya or baad main portugal bhejne kaa vaada kiya
 But he died early and his son did not fulfill his wish
 kowilha vahiin par bas gaya
 a Portuguese mission in 1526 later found that Kovilha was healthy, successful, and healthy in Ethiopia - he married there and died at the age of 74

 He was the first European sailor to sail across the coast of southern Africa - Uttamasha
 lekin bhayankar samudri tufaan se parrast hokar waapas laut gaya
 But it could prove from its west to east that Africa has a southern corner and the world does not end here

 But disciplined and trusted by the king, he was appointed

 Other important names in this fleet of about 170 people were Martim Afonso and Fernao Martins
 aphonso congou main rahaa tha or africa boliyon ko jaanata tha jabaki farnaao morocco ke karawas main rahane ke kaaran arabi sajhata tha
 Ten to twelve convicts were also placed in this fleet by the king, who were given the task of carrying out information and investigative work at dangerous sites
 pratyaashit rup se jahaaj par koi mahila savaar nahin thi
 a week after the move, on July 15, they reached the Canaries, and then the ship broke apart due to the haze
 kep varde main unki mulaakaat honi tay thi lekin paolo da gamma ko koi or jahaaj vahaan najar nahin aayaa
 However the berries and storage ships came within a few hours
 gamma kaa jahaaj agle chaar dinon tak nahin mila
 After meeting, he stayed there for a week and then left on 3 August
 abhi tak ke sabhi portugali yatraaon main navikon ke jahaaj africa ke tat ke nikach se gujarey the - bartelomayo dias ke bhi
 But a stormy wind, which flows across the open Atlantic, pushes the sailors rapidly to the periphery - which Vasco da Gama listened to
 uske apane navikon ko purv kii ore mud kar africa ke tire chalane kii bajaay khule samudr main dakshin kii ore chalane ko kaha
 After walking in the open sea for several days and seeing no land or hope, on 1 November he came close to the ground

 He had received news of the skirmishes with the local people by Dias there, but there was a clash with them as well

 On 16 December he reached the mouth of the river from which the sailors of Bertelomeau Dias forced him to return
 unako vahaan dias dwaara sthapit cross dikhaa
 No one had reached the subsequent routes till date - so the pre-made maps became useless and they had to make new maps

 As it was around Christmas, The Gamma crew named a beach they passed through, "natal"

 He was also opposed in Mombasa, Kenya

 After keeping the ship off the coast, some sailors visited the city where they met white Christians
 baad main pataa chalaa ki mozambik se khabar milane ke baad vahaan ke sultan ne unhen fansaane ke liye ek yojana taiyaar kar rakhi thi
 Gama escaped from there - but he needed sailors or directors knowledgeable of directions to reach India
 usne ek choti naav par aa rahe chaar logon ko pakad liya
 An old Muslim businessman told that Indian sailors live on the nearby coast of Malindi
 koi chaara na dekh vasco malindi pahunchaa
 He felt that he was a Christian - he was considering the pronunciation of Krishna as Christ
 malindi main, da gamma ne ek bhartiya maardarshak ko kaam par rakhaa, jisane aage ke maarg par portugaliyon kii aguwai kii or unhen 20 may, 1498 ke din kalikat, kerala le aayaa, jo bharat ke dakshin pashchimi tat par sthit he
 The king there invited him to come to the port of Calicut, but there were so many obstacles in the path of Gama that he thought that these too would be enemies
 lekin wo milane ke liye vali se mila or phir sangeet ke saath kalikat main zamorin ne gamma kaa swaagat kiya
 Before coming to the court there, he found a temple where inside he found a statue of a goddess
 purtagaliyon ko laga ki ye mariyam kii murti he or use bharosa ho gaya ki zamorin ek isai shaasha he
 That idol was probably that of Maryamma Devi, whom he thought was Mary's mother Mary
 vruttkaar jo gamma ke saath us dal main shamul tha jinako jamorin ne swaagat kiya tha, likhaa - "is desh ke log bhure hai, chote kad ke or pehle dekhne se irshyaalu or matlabi lagate hai
 Men do not wear anything above the waist

 " fernao martins ne zamorin se mulaakaat main gamma kaa arabi anuwaad kiya
 Muslim advisers in the court caused him many hurdles to talk of business
 unhone gamma ke laae uphaar kii khilli udayi or use raja se milaane main deree kii
 Apart from this, he did not even have a proper gift for the king
 aise kaarnon se use zamorin se ladaai ho gai
 Zamorin's Muslim ministers demanded trade taxes from him
 zamorin ne uske dwaara aagrah kiye gaye stambh ko bhi khadaa karwaane se manaa kar diya
 Reconciliation and then the fight continued
 raja ke muslim mantriyon ne uske dal se kai logon ko agava kar liya
 But the customers on board his ship captured Gama

 He ordered the remaining ships to return to Lisbon and, after burying the brother, returned to Lisbon with his crew
 vahaan uskaa bhayankar swaagat hua
 Gama came back and narrated his account to King Manuel
 apane purvagrahon ke vipareet use bharat ke isai alag lage or ve portugal ko pahchaan na sake - jisase use achraj hua
 The presence of Muslims in India also caused him a dilemma
 africa main har jagah muslim shashan or arab sagar main muslim vyapaariyon kii taadaad ko dekhakar usko apane "isai kartavya" kii yaad ai or usne do saalon ke andar do or mishan bheje
 The time of January 1500 AD was a very mascot, but there was a delay of 2 months in sending the mission
 march 1500 main pedro alvarez kaabral kii aguai main 13 jahaaj lisbon se chale
 His goal was to urge the Zamorin to drive away Muslim traders, besides establishing trade bases in Africa and India
 lekin kai jahaaj uttamasha antareep par pahunchne ke gamma ke bataae dakshin-pashchim or phir purv jane ke choti raste par jane ke kram main kho gaye
 Kabral reached Calicut - The new Jamorin accepted the trade of European ships and assured security
 lekin us saal ke liye arab vyapaaree pattan main pahunch chuke the
 Kebral caught the Arab ship - saying it was a violation of the trade treaty with Jamorin
 iske jawaab main unhone portugali factory ke sabhi 70 logon ko maar diya
 But Kabral's visit was not a complete failure - he approached the kings of Sofala and Kilwa
 wo bharat main kunoor bhi gaya or kuch jahaaj jo 'kho gaye the" - dakshin america pahunch gaye the
 Before the burial could return, Manuel i set out with 4 ships led by Hoao the Nova
 kabral ke chode ek sandesh ko africa ke tat par ek puraane juute main tanga paaya or kalikat pahunchaa
 On reaching there, he attacked many Muslim ships
 kunoor main ek factory lagaar waapas portugal laut gaya
 Thus, the ships of Portugal, for the next 20 years, took hostility from the rulers of Calicut
 san 1502 main vasco ko dubaara bheja gaya
 His next visit was in 1502, when he came to know that the people of Calicut had killed all the Portuguese left behind
 apni yatra ke maarg main padane vaale sabhi bhartiya or arab jahazo ko usne dhwast kar diya or kalikat par niyantran karne ke liye aage bad chalaa or usne bahut si daulat par adhikaar kar liya
 This pleased the king of Portugal very much
 wo cochin, kunnur or goa bhi gaya
 To the south of Cochin he came to know Christians living for centuries
 gamma ne kuch portugaliyon ko vahiin chhod diya or us nagar ke shaasha ne use bhi apana sab kuch vahiin chhod kar chale jane ke liye kaha, par vah vahaan se batch niklaa
 His second visit was very successful for the mission of the Portuguese monarch as he fought fiercely against Arab merchants - forcing the Jamorin into trade and locating Christians living in India
 san 1524 main vah apni antim bharat yatra par niklaa
 At that time, Portugal came to India as the Viceroy of the colony, but he died some time after reaching there

 Even after crossing the three continents and two oceans, the battle and success of the king shows his determination to fight the Arab merchants and the African kingdoms in the Arabian Sea and then bring the Portuguese message to India and protect it

 His long journey against his contemporary Columbus did not even revolt and remained exhausted even after he was exhausted
 vasco da gamma ke bharat pahunchne par arab or moore vyapaariyon ke masaale ke vyapaar ko bahut dhakka laga
 Vasco da Gama not only took a dangerous and hard-earned journey to grab this trade, but also fought many wars

 There were no special signs of sportsmanship in his childhood

 After obtaining general education, at the age of 16, in 1922 AD, in the first Brahmin Regiment in Delhi, he enlisted in the army as an ordinary soldier
 jab 'first brahman regiment' main bharti hue us samay tak unke man main hockey ke prati koi vishesh dilchaspee yaa ruchi nahin thi
 The credit for motivating Dhyanchand to play hockey is to Major Tiwari, a Subedar of the Regiment

 dhyanchand ne apni karishmai hockey se german taanashaah hitler hi nahin balki mahaan cricketer don breadman ko bhi apana qaayal bana diya tha
 It is also a coincidence that both these great personalities of sports world are born within two days
 duniya ne 27 agast ko breadman kii janmashti manaai to 29 agast ko vah dhyanchand ko naman karne ke liye taiyaar he, jise bharat main khel diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Bradman was three years younger than Hockey's wizard

 That was in 1935 when the Indian team visited Australia and New Zealand
 tab bhartiya team ek match ke liye edilade main tha or breadman bhi vahaan match khilne ke liye aae the
 Bradman and Dhyanchand then met each other
 breadman ne tab hockey ke jaadugar kaa khel dekhne ke baad kaha tha ki ve is tarah se gol karte hai, jaise cricket main ran banate hai
 Not only this, when Bradman later came to know that Dhyanchand scored 201 goals in 48 matches in this tour, his comment was, whether it was made by a hockey player or by a batsman
 dhyanchand ne iske ek saal baad berlin olympics main hitler ko bhi apni hockey kaa qaayal bana diya tha

 The process of impregnation is caused by the penetration of a sperm into the cytoplasm of the egg
 shukranu kaa keval sir hi koshikadravya ke bheetar pravesh karata he
 The head of the true sperm is made up of only the nucleus, in which the amount of cytoplasm is very small
 andey or shukranu ke cendrak kaa ek duusare se samekan hota he
 With the division of the joint nucleus, the division of cytoplasm also continues
 sansechan se do kaary siddh hote hai
 One is that the genetic material of the male and female is collected by this action, and the other is the stimulation of the egg by this action, which initiates a series of complex but coordinated methods, called embryonic development
 yugmaj khandibhavan yoke kii maatra par nirbhar rahata he
 Eggs with less yoke or yoke are wholly subdivided, and yoke-oriented eggs are undifferentiated
 sarisrupon or pakshiyon ke andey yoke se paripurna ke andey yoke se paripurna hote hai
 In these, the line of zygotic division does not reach beyond the boundary of the cytoplasm of the egg
 aise jantuon main blastedarm kaa vikaas yoke ke upar hota he
 In anphibia, the entire zygote divides, but the cells of the vaginal pole divide more quickly than the animal pole
 baar-baar vibhajit hone ke kaaran yugmaj ek koshika samooh main parinat ho jaataa he jise morula kehete hai
 Gradually, a fluid-filled cavity is produced within the morula, which is called blastocycle, and in this category, the blastula is called blastula
 anfioxs main blastula kii bhitti keval ek koshikastr kii bani hoti he
 For this reason the method of gastrulation is simple
 blastula kii bhitti ek vishesh sthaan par bhi bheetar kii ore baithne lagati he, jise antargaman kehete hai
 Within the blastocial cavity, the edges of the cavity resulting from submergence of the mural start coming close to each other
 is prakaar ek chhidr banataa he jise blastopor kehete hai
 This new cavity, in which the blastopore opens, is called the arcanteron
 blastopor bhrun ke pashv bhaag par sthit hota he
 Now both the primary germplasm are established
 choti koshikaon se bana bahari str bahirjanstar he or archetsron kii bhitti ko banaanevaala aantarik str antarjanstar he
 The cells of the hypoblast are larger than the cells of the epiblast
 blastula main hi gastrulation se ye donon prakaar kii koshikaaye pahachaani ja sakati hai
 Cells located in the area of gingival are small in size and cells located on the vaginal pole are large in size
 pehali shrenee kii koshikaon se epiblast or duusari se hypoblast banataa he
 Gastrulation only produces differences in their mutual local relationship
 blastula main hypoblast koshikaon ke upar kii do yaa teen pankti kii koshikaaye neural plate kii koshikaaye hai
 These are later to become nerve cells
 antarjanstar ke kinarevaali do teen panktiyon kii koshikaon se notocord banataa he or inhen ke sameep madhyajanstar kii koshikaaye hoti hai
 After gastrulation, the notochord is formed from cells located on the roof of the arcaton
 notocord or antarjanstar ke bich kii koshikaaye donon ore khokhli dhaani banaati hai
 This marsupial is of mesarderm or mesoblast

 Their cytoplasm is different from place to place
 cendrak ke chaaron ore kaa koshikadravya kanikamay or bhura hota he tathaa cartex par ek patala str kanikamay pile koshikadravya kaa hota he
 The hyaline cytoplasm goes into the cells that make up the epiblast and the neural plate
 bhura kanikamay koshikadravya antarjanstar koshikaon main or pilaa koshikadravya madhyajanstar koshiyon main jaataa he
 Gastulation in the paddock is somewhat different from this
 mechak ke blastula main upree koshikaaye choti or kaali tathaa neeche kii badi-badi yoke se bhari hui or rangahin hoti he
 There is also an interstate between these upper and lower regions
 nichali koshikaon kii apeksha upree bhaag kii koshikaaye adhik shighrata se vibhajit hoti hai, falat: ye choti koshikaaye bade akaarwali nichali koshikaon ke upar sarak aati hai
 This method is called epiboli
 upree koshikaon kii sankhya tathaa aakaar main vruddhi ke kaaran aisa hota he
 Apart from this, there is an additional incident
 bhrun ke bhavi pasch prishth tal par ek gruve banati he
 This is an early-stage blastopore
 is gruve main se anek koshikaaye bheetar kii ore chali jaati he, jisase gruve adhik gaharaa ho jaataa he or ek nai guha utpann ho jaati he
 This cavity is the arcatron and the fetus is now in the state of the gastrula
 bhrun ke bheetar praveya karanevaali koshikaaye ant:sth kshetra se aati hai
 The cavity within the blastula, the blastocycle, begins to shrink forward and downward due to penetration within these cells and due to the spread of the arcatron, and the cells that enter the inner region form the roof of the arcatron
 blastopor kaa gruve daahine or baayein failata he
 Then this groove comes down on both sides and takes the shape of a circular hole
 isi bich nichle dhruv kii badi-badi koshikaaye bhrun ke bhitari bhaag main pravesh kar jaati hai
 But for some time, a group of these large cells remain in the mouth of the blastopore called the yolk plug
 is samay tak balastopol purnat: lupt ho chukaa hota he
 The cells of the roof of Archentron form the notochord, the cells between the middle layer and the roof
 madhya ke sameep daayen-baayein kii koshikaon ke somite banate hai or donon kinaaron kii koshikaaye parshv patt banaati hai
 The cells of the ground floor of the arcantron form the endoderm layer
 ye koshikaaye ek nalika banaati hai
 This navelika is the alimentary canal
 gastrulation ke pashchaat choti-choti koshikaaye arthath antarjanstareey koshikaaye hi baahar rah jaati hai or madhyajanstareey tathaa antarjanstareey koshikaaye bhrun ke bheetar sthit ho jaati hai
 The infestation of the particular part of the blastula and its possible fate have been decided in many castes of anphibia

 He tricked the Pandavas many times and encouraged his nephew Duryodhana to do devious tricks towards the Pandavas
 uluk shakuni va aarshi kaa putr tha
 Shakuni was born to Subal and Empress Sudarma, the emperor of Gandhar
 shakuni kii bahan gandhari kaa vivaah dhritarashtra se hua tha
 The reason for Shakuni's hatred for the Kuru dynasty was that Bhishma, the commander of Hastinapur, once went to Gandhar to demand Gandhari's hand for Dhritarashtra
 tab gandhari ke pita subal ne ye baat sweekaar kar lee, lekin us samay unhen ye pataa nahin tha kii dhritarashtra janmaandh he
 Shakuni also opposed this, but Gandhari had by now considered Dhritarashtra as her husband

 Duryodhana considered it an insult and returned to Hastinapur
 apane bhaanje kii yah maansik sthiti bhaanpakar, shakuni ne man main pandavon kaa rajpaat chhinane kaa kutil vichaar aayaa
 He invited the Pandavas to play Chaucer and, using his devious intelligence, first asked Yudhishthira to make small claims
 jab yudhisthir khel chhodane kaa man banaata to shakuni dwaara kuch naa kuch kahkar yudhisthir se koi naa koi daav lagava letaa
 In this way, Maharaj Yudhishthira continued to defeat all his things by putting all his things on the daava and in the end he also put his brothers and his wife on the dao and lost them too and thus by insulting Draupadi, Duryodhana took his vengeance

 The ten best Hindi writers up to the twentieth century and based on the mentions and deliberations made by the best critics in the context of the works of various genres of Hindi literature, are mainly the selection of ten outstanding writers or literary works, which are relatively superior It is assumed
 hindi ke sudeergh kaaleen evam vishaal saahitiyik kshetra se vibhinn vidhaagat sarvshereshth lekhakon evam lekhan kaa chayan kathin evam vivaadaaspad bhi ho saktaa he; parantu yah prayek pathak kii jigyaasa kaa sahaj ang he
 Here, instead of personal interest in selection, the basis of comprehensive critical understanding and valid critical writing has been adopted
 dhyatavya he ki is chayan kii uttar seemaa beesvin sadi tak hi he
 Information related to the entire selection has also been given
 anek anubhaagon main sahi avadharana ke liye das sarvshereshth ke baad praayah samakaksh yaa turat baad sthaan paa sakane yogya or bhi 10 shreshthatar kii suchi di gayi he
 Multiple attempts to select the best critics of Hindi literature have also been made by critics in the form of book-writing and special issue of magazine
 sarvapratham dow0 ramchandra tiwari ne apni pustak 'hindi aalochana : shikharon kaa saakshaatkaar' main sarvshereshth das aalochakon kaa chayan karke unke aalochanatmak yogadan kaa vivechan prastut kiya tha
 Again, in the first section of the 'concentrate on Centenary Criticism' edited by Arvind Tripathi, the list of 'navratna of Hindi Criticism' was presented in the first section
 in donon adhyayanon main acharya mahavir prasad dvivedi ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Dwivedi's historical contribution will undoubtedly be more than that of any other superior critic, but keeping in mind neutral independent writing, it is clear that some of his books are rightly due to his being an early-round critic
 Criticism or literary history also cannot be counted as the best book
 vastutah unhone aalochana kaa path taiyaar kiya
 Among the other nine critics mentioned by Dr
 Ramachandra Tiwari, Dr
 Tiwari himself believes that his writing lacks freshness and freshness, and often he takes a pen on it only after a certain amount of time has passed
 unki tulana main dow0 tiwari ne dow0 nandakishor naval aadi kii visheshta bataayi he tathaa mana he ki bachchan singh ji vidwaan sahitya-adhyeta kii bhoomika hi apekshaakrit nibhaate rahe
 Therefore, due to the overall literary importance, he is recognized as a superior critic but not in the top ten
 'vartmaan sahitya' ke shatabdi aalochana visheshank kii samiksha karte hue suprasiddh kavi madan kashyap ne likhaa tha ki isamen shaamil chah naamon pan0 ramachandra shukla, acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi, muktibodh, dow0 ramvilas sharma, dow0 namvar singh or vijayadev narayan saahi ko lekar shaayad hi koi vivaad ho xxrep 4 
 But Acharya Nandadulare is Vajpayee, so why not Dr
 Nagendra? In this special case, 'navaratna' also selected the agnostic
 is sandarbh main madan kashyap ji spasht kehete hai ki agyeya kaa srujanaatmak vyaktitv beshak bahut bada or sadi ke kisi bhi chayan main shaamil hone ke kaabil he
 But as a poet-critic he cannot be paired with Muktibodh and Sahi
 unka aalochanatmak lekhan utana suvyavasthit nahin he
 He should have been replaced by Nalin Vilochan Sharma or one of the critics associated with the creativity of the last three decades of the last century, Dr
 Parmanand Shrivastava, Dr
 Manager Pandey etc
 is sandarbh main dhyatavya he ki nalin ji kaa lekhan avyavasthit tathaa bahut-kuch aprakashit he
 Manager Pandey proves to be a more capable personality to get in the top ten in terms of new and strong ideas and systematic writing

 The publication and discussion of 'mitro Marjani' has also been in the form of a story and its author himself objected to its inclusion in the novel form
 atah yahan ise upanyaason main sammilit na kar kahaniyon main hi sammilit kiya gaya he
 Hundred Years of Fiction - No
 Vibhuti Narayan Rai, Shilpayan, Shahdara, Delhi das shreshth naatakon kii bajaay yahan naatakakaron ko chunaa gaya he; kyonki anek nirvivaadit shreshth naatakakaron kaa bhi sarvshereshth naatak koun sa he yah bataa paanaa kisi sameekshak ke liye kathin rahaa he
 For example, Prasad ji's drama Skandagupta is superior to the overall vision or Chandragupta? The same is true with Mohan Rakesh, Surendra Verma etc
 haan naatakakaron ke naam ke aage di gayi sheersh kritiyon kii suchi anumanik nahin tatsambandhi shreshth aalochanatmak lekhan par aadhaarit he
 Here the first, third and fourth names are of historical importance

 The author's names are next to his masterpieces
 phir vishesh adhyayan hetu ullekhneey kritiyon ke naam bhi de diye gayi hai
 There is often no scope for controversy in the selection of epics, because the rich criticism of Hindi-tradition has kept the epics tight enough that in modern times, especially in the post independence era, even the best poets in Hindi often do not even have the courage to write epics
 Could have done
 hindi aalochana kaa yah aatank hi he jisase dinakar ji jaise kavi ne jab puri tarah tatpar hokar mahakavy likhane kaa man banaaya to rup kii drushti se 'mahakavy' na likhakar 'kavy naatak' likhaa; taaki anaavashyak vistaar se bhi batch saken or bahut se roopaadhaarit akshepon se bhi agrim chhutkaaraa mil jaye
 Even the poems which many poets wrote earlier were never counted in the best poetry
 atah hindi main utkrisht mahakavyon kii sankhya das ke bheetar hi rahi he
 Yes, it is definitely that these epics are invaluable treasures of world cinema

 There is a rich series of the best Hindi storytellers

 At the same time, prejudice prevails, because the story-review in Hindi is not yet rich enough in terms of coverage

 Persian is the language of the country of Iran, but its name is Persian because the inhabitants of Persia, which is actually the name of a province of Iran, first made political progress

 Conciliations are conversations that aim at resolving disputes, creating consensus on the direction of various actions, bargaining for individual or collective benefit, or shaping the results to satisfy different interests

 Settlement negotiations take place in trade, non-profit organizations, government branches, legal proceedings, between countries and in personal situations such as marriages, divorces, raising children and everyday life
 is vishay ke adhyayan ko samjhauta vaarta kaa siddhant kaha jaataa he
 Professional negotiators are often experts, such as union negotiators, leverage procurement negotiators, peace negotiators, hostage negotiators, or they may also work under another designation, such as a diplomat, legislator, or broker
 angrezi kaa shabd "nigociation" ko latin abhivyakti, "negotiatus" se liya gaya he, jo negotiare kaa bhoot kridant he jiskaa arth he "vyapaar ko aage badhanaa"
 "negotium" kaa vastutah arth he "fursat nahin"
 Conciliation negotiations typically reveal themselves with a trained negotiator acting on behalf of a particular organization or position
 isaki tulana madhyasthata ke saath kii ja sakati he jahaan ek tatasth tritiy paksh donon pakshon ke tarkon ko sunata he or donon dalon ke bich ek samjhauta karaane main madad karne kaa prayaas karata he
 It also relates to the panchayat, as in a legal proceeding, with both parties arguing for the merits of their "case" and then a panch decides the outcome for both parties
 samjhauta vaarta ke aavashyak bhaagon kii behatar samaj viksit karne ke liye, use vibhajit karne ke kai bhinn tareeke hai
 a perspective of negotiation involves three basic elements: process, behavior and substance
 The process refers to how the parties negotiate: the context of the negotiations, the parties in the negotiations, the strategy and sequence used by the parties, and the stages in which all these will flourish
 Behavior reflects the relationship between these parties, the dialogue between them and the styles they adopt
 padaarth kaa taatpary us chiz se he jiske liye ye dal samjhauta vaarta karte hai: agenda, mudde, vikalp or samjhauta jis par ant main pahunchaa jaataa he
 Another approach to negotiation involves 4 elements: strategy, process and tools and tactics
 The strategy includes the top level goals - usually which include relationships and end results
 Processes and tools include the steps to be taken and the roles to be adopted both during the preparation and negotiation of negotiations with other parties
 The device includes more detailed statements and actions and reactions given to the statements and actions of others
 Some people add persuasion and influence to it, saying that they have become integral to the success of modern-day settlement negotiations and therefore should not be left out
 kushal vaartakar, vibhinn kismon kii yuktiyon kaa prayog kar sakate hai, jisaki vyapak seemaa vaarta sammohan se lekar maangon ko sidhe-sapaat tareeke se prastut karne tak yaa adhik bhraamak drushtikon ke antargat, jaise cheri picking, purv shart kii sthapana tak faili ho sakati he
 Threats and salute tactics can also play a role in turning the outcome of settlement negotiations
 ek anya samjhauta vaarta yukti he bura aadmi / acha aadmi he
 Bad guy / good guy tactic is when a negotiator uses anger and intimidation as the bad guy
 doosraa vaartakar ek achche aadmi ke rup main vichaarsheel or samajhadaar kii tarah kaam karata he
 The good man blames the bad guy for all difficulties in trying to get concession and compromise from his adversary
 vakaalat drushtikon main, ek kushal vaartakar aam taur par samjhauta vaarta main ek dal ke vakil ke rup main kaary karata he or us dal ke liye sabase anukool sambhavit parinaamon ko praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he
 In this process, the negotiator tries to determine the minimum result that the other party is willing to accept and then adjusts their demands accordingly
 vakaalat drushtikon main, ek safal samjhauta vaarta tab maani jaati he jab vaartakar, anpane dal dwaara icchit sabhi yaa adhikansh parinaamon ko, duusare dal ko samjhauta vaarta ko khandit karne ke liye bina bhadakaae, praapt karne main sakasham hota he, jab tak ki samjhauta vaarta kaa sarvottam vikalp sweekaarya naa ho jaae
 Traditional settlement negotiations are sometimes called win-lose because of the notion of a fixed "pie", that is, one person's gain results in another person's loss
 yah keval tabhi sach he, jab keval ek hi mudde ko hal kiye jane kii zarurat he, jaise ki ek saral bikri samjhauta vaarta main keemat
 During the 1960s, Gerard I
 Nirenberg recognized the role of negotiation in resolving disputes in personal, business and international relations
 He published The Art of Negotiating, in which he states that the negotiators' philosophy determines which approach the negotiation will take
 His Everybody Vince philosophy assures that all parties benefit from the negotiation process, which produces far more successful outcomes than the opposing view of "the winner takes away everything"
 gating tu yas, harvard vaarta pariyojna ke hisse ke rup main roger fisher or wiliam uri dwaara prakashit kii gai
 The approach of this book, referred to as theoretical negotiation, is sometimes called mutual benefit bargaining
 aapasi laabh drushtikon ko prabhavi dhang se paryaavarniya sthitiyon main or saath hi saath shram sambandhon main lagu kiya gaya he jahaan dal samjhauta vaarta ko "samasya samaadhaan" ke rup main swaroopit karte hai
 If many issues are discussed, differences in the preferences of the parties make the "sabki jai-jai" negotiation possible
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek shram samjhauta vaarta main shram sangh, vetan vruddhi kii bajaay jeevika suraksha ko zyaada tarjeeh de sakate hai
 If the employer has opposite preferences, then there is a possibility of a deal which would be beneficial for both the parties
 Therefore such negotiation is not an anti-zero-profit game
 saidhantik samjhauta vaarta vidhi, chaar mukhya charnon se nirmit he: samasya se logon ko pruthak karnaa, hiton par dhyaan dena, na ki padon par, kuch karne kaa faisla lene se pehle vibhinn sambhaavnaaon ko utpann karnaa or jor dena ki parinaam, vastuparak maanak par aadhaarit hon
 There are many more scholars who have contributed to the field of negotiation, including Holly Schroth and Timothy Deonotte at UC Berkeley, Gerard E
 Watzke at Tulane University, Sara Kobb at George Mason University, Len Riskin at the University of Missouri, Harvard Howard Rifa, Robert Mersey and Lawrence Susskind at MIT and Adil Najam and j at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy Swald Salacuse
 samjhauta vaarta ke sabase prasiddh drushtaant main shaayad naarangi par hui ek charchaa shaamil he
 The most obvious approach was to cut it in half and each person would get their fair share
 But, when the negotiators started talking to each other about their interests, a better solution to the problem became apparent
 apane naashte ke liye naarangi ke ras ke icchhuk vyakti ne vah bhaag le liya or murabba banane ke icchhuk vyakti ne chhilka vaala hissaa le liya
 Both sides got more in the end
 Neither of the two agreements is particularly constructive
 naarangi kaa drushtaant tab rachanaatmakataa kii ek kahani ban jaataa jab donon paksh naarangi kaa ek ped lagane yaa ek bagichaa lagane main sahyog karne kaa faisla karte
 thik isi tarah, bowing apane nae 787 drimliner ke liye mishrit plastic ke daine kharidta he jise japani aapurtikartaaon dwaara dizine or banaaya gaya he or phir purna kiye hue 787 ko japani sarkaar dwaara pradutt acchhee sabsidi ke saath waapas japani airlinon ko bechata he
 This is what creativity means in dialogue
 In modern business schools, much is being learned about creative processes
 shaikshanik sammelnon or companiyon ke bordroom main "navachaar" ko charchit shabd bana kar paathyakram pesh kiye ja rahe hai or shodh-nibandho kaa prastaav kiya ja rahaa he
 And, the more it is heard about innovation and creative processes, the more it is appreciated and which the Japanese approach to negotiation, naturally, uses all the techniques on which, in general, any creative process Emphasis is given in dialogue
 beshak, is tathy kaa ek gahari buniyadi vyakhya pradaan kii jaati he ki prakritik sansadhano kii kami or apekshaakrit algaav kii sthiti ke baavjood, kyon japani is tarah ke ek safal samaaj kaa nirmaan kar sake
 haalanki japani samaaj main bhi, beshak rachanaatmakataa ke raste main apni kuch baadhaaen hai - padanukram or samashtiwad do hai - tathaapi unhone samjhauta vaarta kii ek aisi style viksit kii jo kai myanon main is tarah kii anaavashyak pratikulata ko mitaa detii he
 In fact, the ten new rules advocated by Hernandez and Graham for global negotiations correspond well to the approach that is naturally seen in the Japanese: japani logon kii prathaon ke alaava, un vibhootiyon ko bhi shrey diya janaa chahie jinhone samjhauta vaartaon main rachanaatmakataa kii hameshaa se vakaalat kii he
 The advice of Howard Rifa and his colleagues is: 


 teams should think and plan informally together and jointly brainstorm what can be considered "dialogue" or "forethought"
 is praarambhik charan main pai ko kaise vibhajit karen, ise lekar donon paksh koi bhi samanvay, patibaddhta, yaa tark nahin karenge
roger fisher or wiliam uri ne gating tu yas main apane chauthe adhyay kaa sheershak diya, "inventing opshans for mutual gen"
 david lax or james sebenius, apni mahatvapurn nai kitaab 3d-nigociations main, gating tu yas se aage nikal jate hai or "rachanaatmak samjhaute" or "mahaan samjhaute" ke bare main charchaa karte hai
 Lawrence Susskind and his colleagues recommended "parallel informal negotiations" to build constructive dialogue outcomes
 These ideas should be kept at the forefront while talking about negotiation negotiations
 Talking of "making deals" and "solving problems" the sector is generally still stuck in the past
 yahaan tak ki "vin-vin" jaise shabdon kaa prayog, puraane pratispardhi soch ke avshesh ko hi pradarshit karata he
 The point is that a dialogue is not something that can be won or lost and the competitive metaphor restricts creativity
 samasya-samaadhaan roopak bhi yahi karata he
 Thus, the first rule of negotiation is: Accept only constructive results! Linda Lawrence of ideaworks, a Newport Beach consulting firm, has developed a most useful list of ways to generate more ideas during negotiations: japani pathakon ke liye, isamen se kaaphi kuch parichit hoga
 japaniyon ko shaareerik nikatataa main laana aasaan he, ve sahasrabdiyon se usee prakaar rah rahe hai
 Japanese companies do not have so many marketing experts who are different from engineers and who are different from finance analysts

 Physical movement - portrays the beginning of the day in the typical Japanese factory
 aisa prathit hota he ki japani, chote samoohon main sabase acha kaam karte hai
 Silence is definitely fine
 The Japanese invented karaoke
 It is difficult for Japanese to criticize others, especially foreigners
 The use of visuals and overall thinking occurs naturally in the Japanese
 Gaps are also a common process for Japanese
 The Japanese will work better with people they are familiar with
 yah bhi dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki inamen se kuch takneekein japani vaartakaron ko videshi lagengi
 udhaaharan ke liye, japaniyon ke liye vividhta majboot saathi nahin he - uddeshypurna tareeke se mahilaon or vividhta ke anya tatwon ko unke samoohon main jodna ajeeb prathit hoga
 baharhaal, ve do pramukh chizein jise japani log, samjhauta vaarta main karte hai jise anya log bhi sikh sakate hai or unhen siikhnaa chahie: pehla, is grah par japani, jaankaree shoonyata ke champion hai
 They keep their mouth shut and let everyone else talk
 is prakaar, kisi bhi anya samaaj kii tulana main, ve kaaphi had tak apane antarrashtriya sahyogiyon kii vividhta kaa upyog karte hai
 It is often criticized as copying and borrowing, but being open to everyone's ideas has always been important to creativity and human progress
 haalanki, duniya bhar ke baaki logon kii tarah japani bhi jati-kendrit hai, ve abhi bhi videshi vichaaron kaa bahut adhik sammaan karte hai
 Second, the Japanese will only work with the dolphins when they have a choice
 Confidence and creativity are concomitant
 or, ve apane videshi samakakshon ko adhik sahyogaatmak tareeke se vyavhaar karne ke liye prashikshit karte hai taaki unhi kaa bhala ho sake
 freemont, CA main choti kaaron ke nirmaan ke liye toyota or general motors ke bich 25 saal kaa sanyukt udhyam ko ek pramukh udhaaharan ke rup main dekhiye
 Compliance with the principles of creativity would be appropriate in at least three points during negotiations
 Howard Rifa's suggestion above mentioned that they should be used in pre-negotiation meetings
 Second, others advocate their use in case of deadlock
 udhaaharan ke liye, peru main rio urubamba prakritik gas pariyojna sambandhit samjhauta vaarta main shaamil companiyaan or paryaavaran gut ek aise mode par pahunche jo us samay ek na sulajhane vaali vikatsthiti jaan padi - pracheen jangal se guzarane vaali sadaken or ek vishaal pipeline, paristhitiki aapadaa hogi
 rachanaatmak hal kya he? ek apatati manch ke rup main doordaraj ke gas kshetra ke bare main sochie, pipe line ko bhumigat le jaaie or aavashyaktaanusaar karmiyon or upkarnon ko vayumarg se le jaaie
 Finally, even when negotiators arrive at a "yes", a scheduled review of the agreement will actually lead from "yes" to constructive results
 Perhaps such a review can be scheduled six months after the implementation of the agreement
 lekin, mudda yah he ki is vishay par rachanaatmak charchaa ke liye alag se samay avashya rakhana chahie ki sambandhon ke liye taiyaar logon ko kaise sudhara jaae? is tarah ke kisi satr kaa jor hameshaa nae vichaaron ko saamne akhane par hona chahie - is sawaal kaa jawaab ki "hamane kis bare main nahin sochaa?" Shell has identified five styles / responses to the negotiations
 Individuals may often have a strong inclination towards multiple styles; The style used during a settlement negotiation depends on the context and the interests of the other party, among other factors
 iske alaava, samay ke saath style bhi badal sakati he
 Clearly, these two methods are fundamentally different from negotiation, and will require a different approach
 Ignoring it can be disastrous for results, but it is all too often
 kyonki vitaran drushtikon main prayek vaartakar, pai ke sabase bade sambhav tukade ke liye sangharsh karata he, yah bilkul uchit ho saktaa he - kuch khaas simaaon ke bheetar - ki duusare paksh ko ek saathi kii bajaay ek virdohi ke rup main dekha jaae or apekshaakrit thodaa kathor rukh apanaaya jaae
 lekin yah rukh us haalat main anuchit hoga jab prayaas aisi kisi vyavastha par muhar lagane kaa ho rahaa ho jo donon pakshon ke sarvshereshth hit main ho
 yadi donon jitate hai, to is baat kaa mahatv goud he ki kise adhik phayda hua
 a good agreement is not one that has maximum benefits, but one that has optimal benefits
 But the implication of this is not at all that we should leave our profits just like this
 But a collaborative attitude will pay dividends regularly
 The benefit that is gained is not at the cost of the other, but with him
 samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya main jazbaat ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate he, haalanki yah haal ke varshon main hi hua ki unke prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya ja rahaa he
 Emotion has the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation
 vaartaon ke dauraan, yah faisla ki ab samjhaute par muhar lagaai jaae yaa nahin, aanshik rup se bhaavnaatmak karkon par tikaa hota he
 Negative emotions can lead to intense and even irrational behavior and can result in conflict, ruining settlement negotiations, but can be helpful in getting concessions
 duusari ore, sakaaratmak bhavanaaen aksar ek samjhaute tak pahunchane ko aasaan kar detii hai or sanyukt laabh ko adhiktam karne main madad karti hai, lekin yah riyaayaten hasil karne main bhi sahaayak ho sakati hai
 Positive and negative discrete emotions can be demonstrated to affect actions and relational outcomes, and may play a different role across cultural boundaries
 bhav prabhaav :swabhaavgat bhav, samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya ke vibhinn charnon ko prabhavit karte hai: kin ranneetiyon ke prayog kii yojana banaai gai he, koun si ranneetiyaan vastav main chuni gayi, vah nazariyaa jisase anya dal or unke iraadon ko dekha jaataa he, ek samjhaute par pahunchane kii unki ichha or vaarta kaa antim parinaam
 samjhauta vaarta ke ek yaa ek se adhik pakshon kii sakaaratmak prabhavakaarita or nakaaratmak prabhavakaarita, bilkul bhinn parinaamon ko janm de sakati he
 Before the negotiation process begins, people with a positive attitude have more confidence, and a higher tendency to plan the use of a collaborative strategy
 samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan, jo vaartakar ek sakaaratmak manobhaav main rahete hai ve is sahabhaagita kaa adhik anand lete hai, vivaadaaspad vyavhaar kam dikhaate hai, kam aakraamak ranneeti kaa upyog karte hai or adhik sahyogaatmak ranneetiyon ko apanaate hai
 This increases the likelihood of the parties reaching their key goals and enhancing the ability to find integrated benefits
 beshak, nakaaratmak yaa prakritik prabhavakaarita vaale vaartakaron kii tulana main sakaaratmak prabhavakaarita vaale vaartakar, adhik samjhauton tak pahunche or unhone un samjhauton ke liye sammaan kii pravriti ko adhik darshaya
ye anukool parinaam, nirnay lene kii behatar prakriya ke kaaran upje, jaise lacheelee soch, rachanaatmak samasya samaadhaan, dusron ke nazariye kaa sammaan, jokhim lene kii ichha or ucch aatmavishvaas
samjhauta vaarta ke baad bhi sakaaratmak bhav ke laabhadaayak parinaam hote hai
 This increases satisfaction with the results achieved and affects a person's desire for future participation
 ek samjhaute tak pahunchane se ubhara PA dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko aasaan karata he, jo prabhavakaari patibaddhta ko badhaata he jisase baad kii sahabhaagita kaa maarg prashast karata he
 PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts the notion of self-performance, in such a way that performance is perceived as relatively better than it actually is
 is prakaar, praapt parinaamon par khud ke report vaale adhyayan pakshpaati ho sakate hai
 Negative expressions have a detrimental effect on various stages of the negotiation process
 haalanki vibhinn nakaaratmak bhavanaaen vaarta ke parinaamon ko prabhavit karti hai, abhi tak krodh par sarvaadhik shodh hua he
 Angry negotiators plan to use competitive strategy more often before negotiations begin and cooperate less
 ye pratispardhi ranneetiyaan ghatit sanyukt parinaamon se sambandhit hai
 Anger disrupts the process, reducing the level of trust during negotiations, tarnishing the parties 'focus, narrowing the parties' focused attention, and changing their central goal of reaching agreement against the other party
 Makes reactive
 krodhit vaartakar pratidwandvi ke hiton kii ore kam dhyaan dete hai or ve unke hiton kii pahchaan karne main kam sateek hote hai, is prakaar unhen kamatar sanyukt laabh praapt hota he
 Furthermore, since anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their priorities, it increases the likelihood that they will reject a profitable offer
 Anger also does not help in achieving negotiation goals: it Reduces joint gains and does not help increase personal gains, as angry negotiators do not succeed in making more claims for themselves
 In addition, negative emotions lead to accepting agreements that are not positive utilitarian actions but have negative utility
 haalanki, samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan nakaaratmak bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti kabhi-kabhi laabhprad ho sakati he: jaays tareeke se vyakt krodh apni patibaddhta, eemaandaaree or zaruuraton ko darshane kaa ek prabhavi tarika ho saktaa he
 Furthermore, although NA reduces the benefit in integrated tasks, it is a better strategy than PA in distribution tasks
 In his work on negative sentiment generation and white noise, Sednor found support for the existence of a negative emotion generation mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers of other ethnic origins
 " samjhauta vaarta, badale main, ek jaateey samooh yaa ling samooh ke prati dabe vidwesh dwaara nakaaratmak rup se prabhavit ho sakati he
 Research shows that negotiators' feelings do not necessarily affect the negotiation process
 Albrasin and others suggested that there are two conditions for emotional affect, both related to ability and motivation: is model ke anusaar, bhaawanaaon ke vaarta ko prabhavit karne kii sambhaavna keval tab rahati he jab ek adhik he or doosraa kam he
 When both ability and motivation are low, emotion cannot be identified and when both are high, emotion can be identified but it will be considered irrelevant for judgment
 For example, one possible implication of this model is that Is that pa's positive effects on negotiation can be seen only when either motivation or ability are low
 samjhauta vaarta main bhaavana par kiye gaye adhikansh adhyayan, prakriya par vaartakar kii khud kii bhaawanaaon ke prabhaav par kendrit hai
 However, what the next party thinks can be equally important, we know that group emotions affect processes at the individual level and group level
 jab baat vaarta kii aati he, to duusare dal main vishwaas, uski bhaavana ko prabhavit karne ke liye aavashyak he or drishyata prabhaav badhaati he
 Emotions contribute to the negotiation process in such a way that it signals what the person feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in disruptive behavior and indicate what the next step is
 Should be: PA indicates the same, while NA indicates that mental or behavioral adjustment is required
 Can have two basic effects on defeat: mimetic / reciprocal or complementary
 For example, disappointment or sadness will inspire kindness and greater cooperation
 In a study by Butt and others that mimicked actual multi-stage settlement negotiations, most people reacted in a reciprocal rather than complementary way to the partner's feelings
 It was seen that the feelings of the antagonist and the specific strategies on the selected strategies differed
 -different effects occur: samjhauta vaarta ek jatil anyonyakriya he
 It is a very difficult task to cover all its complexities, only some aspects of it are isolated and controlled
 is kaaran, samjhauta vaarta ke adhikansh adhyayan prayogshaala sthitiyon ke tahat kiye jate hai or ye kuch hi pahaluon par prakaash daalate hai
 Although laboratory studies have their advantages, they have some major drawbacks when studying emotions: is bhaag kaa praathmik uddeshy he samjhauta vaarta main saanskrithik bhinnataaon kii seemaa ko pradarshit karnaa or yah darshana kii kaise ye bhinnataayen antarrashtriya vyapaarik vaartaon main samasyaon kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Readers will see that national culture does not determine the behavior of the settlement negotiations
 balki, rashtriya samskruti kai karkon main se ek he jo vaarta mej par vyavhaar ko prabhavit karti he, yadhyapi mahatvapurn tareeke se
 udhaaharan ke liye, ling, sanghathanaatmak samskruti, antarrashtriya anubhav, udyog yaa kshetreey prishthbhumi, ye sabhi mahatvapurn prabhaav ho sakate hai
 Of course, all forms of stereotypes are dangerous, and international negotiators must know the people they are dealing with, not just about their country, culture, or company
 yahaan saamagree, pichley teen dashakon ke antarrashtriya samjhauta vaarta vyavhaar ke vyavasthit adhyayan par aadhaarit he jisamen udyog jagat se jude 17 deshon ke 1500 se adhik logon kii samjhauta vaarta shaileyon par vichaar kiya gaya
 The work included interviews with experienced officials and comments from people participating in the field, as well as behavioral science laboratory work that included surveying and analyzing videotaped talks
 Countries that were studied included Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines, Russia, Israel, Norway, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Britain, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Canada and the United States
 These countries were chosen because they constitute the most important trading partners of America's present and future
 kai samskritiyon main mote taur par dekhte hue, do mahatvapurn sabak nikaale ja sakate hai
 The first is that regional generalizations are often not correct
 udhaaharan ke liye, japani or korian samjhauta vaarta kii style kuch myanon main kaaphi samaan he, lekin anya tareekon se ve adhik bhinn lag sakati hai
 The second lesson revealed by the research is that Japan is an extraordinary place: Japanese people end up on or near the scale, on almost every dimension of the negotiation style
 udhaaharan ke liye, adhyayan kii gai samskritiyon main, japani log nunatam chakshu sampark kaa upyog karte hai
 Sometimes, Americans are at the other end
 lekin vastav main, adhikansh samay america bich main kahin hote hai
 The reader will see that this is evident in the figures presented in this section
