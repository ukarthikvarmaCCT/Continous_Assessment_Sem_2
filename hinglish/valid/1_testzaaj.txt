 It seems that rites were performed on the basis of traditional practices before Grihasuutras
 sabase pehle grihasutron main hi sanskaron kii puri paddati kaa varnan miltaa he
 In the description of the rites in the Grihyasutras, marriage rites are first mentioned
 iske baad garbhaadhan, punswan, simantonnayan, jaat- karm, namakaran, nishkraman, ann- prashan, chuda- karm, upanayan or samaavartan sanskaron kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The description of funeral rites is not found in most householders, as it was considered inauspicious to do so
 smritiyon ke aachaar prakarnon main sanskaron kaa ullekh he or tatsambandhi niyam die gaye hai
 These describe in detail the Upanayana and marriage rites, as the person entered the Brahmacharya ashram through the Upanayana rites and the Grihastha ashram through the marriage rites
 sanskaar kaa abhipraay un dharmik krityon se tha jo kisi vyakti ko apane samudaay kaa purna rup se yogya sadsy banane ke uddeshy se uske sharir, man or mastishk ko pavitra karne ke liye kiye jate the, kintu hindu sanskaron kaa uddeshy vyakti main abhisht gunon ko janm dena bhi tha
 The use of the word "sanskar" is not found in Vedic literature

 Kumaril reveals some different views of it in the Tantravartik treatise
 unke anusaar manushya do prakaar se yogya banataa he - purv- karm ke dosha ko dur karne se or nae gunon ke utpaadan se
 Both of these rituals work

 Through the rites, man developed his natural instincts and took welfare of both himself and the society
 ye sanskaar is jivan main hi manushya ko pavitra nahin karte the, uske parloukik jivan ko bhi pavitra banaate the
 Home was performed before each rite, but according to the Griसूasutra which the person followed, the number of sacrifices, the use of hymns and mantras differed among different families

 vivaah, 15-19 panch dainik mahayajna, 20-26 saat pakyagya, 27-33 saat haviryagy, 34-40 saat somayajna
 But most theology has not mentioned the four Vratas of the Vedas, the Pancha Dainik Mahayagya, the seven Pakyagyas, the seven Haviryagyas and the seven Somayagyas in the rites
 manu ne garbhaadhan, punswan, simantonnayan, jatakarm, namakaran, nishkraman, annaprashan, chudakarm, upanayan, keshant, samaavartan, vivaah or shmashaan, in teraa sanskaron kaa ullekh kiya he
 Yajnavalkya has also described these rites
 keval keshant kaa varnan usamen nahin miltaa he, kyonki is kaal tak vaidic granthon ke adhyayan kaa prachlan band ho gaya tha
 Later rituals give sixteen the number of sacraments, but the Gautam Dharmasutra and the Grihyasutras do not mention the funeral rites, as it was considered inauspicious to describe the funeral rites
 swami dayanand saraswati ne apni sanskaar vidhi tathaa pandit bhimsen sharma ne apni shodash sanskaar vidhi main solah sanskaron kaa hi varnan kiya he
 Both these authors have included funerals in sixteen rites
 garbhavastha main garbhaadhan, punswan or simantonnayan teen sanskaar hote hai
 The purpose of these three is to make the life-style of the parents such that the child is born with good values

 In linguistics, 'syllable' or syllable is an organized unit of sounds
 kisi bhi shabd ko anshon main todakar bolaa ja saktaa he or shabdaansh shabd ke vah ansh hote hai jinhen or zyaada chota nahin banaaya ja saktaa varanaa shabd kii dhvaniyaan badal jaati hai
 For example, the word 'suddenly' has three syllables - 'A', 'cha' and 'naq'
 yadi ruk-ruk kar 'a-chaa-nak' bolaa jaye to shabd ke teenon shabdaansh khandit rup se dekhe ja sakate hai lekin shabd kaa uccharan sunne main sahi prathit hota he
 If 'nak' is broken further, the sounds of the word become wrong - 'a-cha-na-k'
 This word is also not called 'a-chan-k' because it also makes the pronunciation wrong
 kuch chote shabdon main ek hi shabdaansh hota he, jaise 'main', 'kaan', 'haath', 'chal' or 'ja'
 kuch shabdon main do shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'chalakar', khaanaa, rumal or sabzi 
 Some have three or more syllables, such as 'important' and 'international'
 akshar shabd kaa arth he - 'jo na ghat sake, na nasht ho sake'
 It was earlier used for 'speech' or 'speech' and for syllable
 'varna' ke liye bhi akshar kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa
 This is the reason that the word 'letter' is also commonly used today for the characters expressed by script signs
 bhashaa ke vaigyanik adhyayan ne akshar ko angreji 'silabal' kaa arth pradaan kar diya he, jisamen swar, swar tathaa vyanjan, anuswaar sahit swar yaa vyanjan dhvaniyaan sammilit maani jaati hai
 a unit of sound or sound community spoken in the same stroke or force is called akshara
 ikai kii pruthakta kaa aadhaar swar yaa swararat vyanjan hota he
 The consonant sound comes as a part of the vowel in an accent or on the ante
 astu, akshar main swar hi merudand he
 Neither a vowel can be separated from a vowel, nor is a vowel formed without vowels or vowel consonants
 uccharan main yadi vyanjan moti kii tarah he to swar dhaage kii tarah
 If the voice is a strong emperor then the consonant is the king
 isi aadhaar par praayah akshar ko swar kaa paryaay maan liya jaataa he, kintu aisa he nahin, phir bhi akshar nirmaan main swar kaa atyadhik mahatv hota he
 Consonant sounds in some languages also help in letter formation
 angreji bhashaa main na, r, l jaisi vyanjan dhvaniyaan swararat bhi uccharit hoti hai evam swardhvani ke samaan akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 Akshar word is used in Hindi for English Syllable
 dow ramvilas sharma ne silabal ke liye 'swarik' shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 
 chunki akshar shabd kaa bhashaa or vyakaran ke itihaas main anek arthchhaya ke liye prayog kiya gaya he, isliye silabal ke arth main iske prayog se bhramasrijan kii ashanka rahati he
 In the pronunciation of a word, the sound which has peak or height is the same letter or syllable, as on the sound in the hand
 is shabd main ek akshar he
 The word 'unimaginative' has three letters - A, Kal, Pit; Three - come to freedom; That is, where there is a separation of the pronunciation of the vowel in the word, there is a separation of the letter
 dhwani utpaadan kii drushti se vichaar karne par phuffus sanchalan kii ikai ko akshar yaa swarik kehete hai, jisamen ek hi sheershadhvani hoti he
 From the point of view of anatomy, the letter or vocal can also be called pleural pulsation, which is pronounced in the sound system

 SQL, Edgar F
 One of the earliest computer programming languages of cod's relational model was that he presented in his influential 1970s document, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" and it became one of the most widely used for relational databases Became the language of SQL ko 1970 ke dashak ke shuruuaat main dainiel richardsan, donald di chemberlin or remand epa

 Common criticisms of SQL included lack of portability among vendors on various operating mechanisms, inappropriate handling of lost data) and unnecessarily complex and sometimes ambiguous language grammar and meanings
 isamen relational alzebra jaise aupchaarik bhashaa kii kathorta kaa bhi abhaav he
 The SQL language is sub-divided into several language elements, including: SQL main sabase aam kaarywahi queri karnaa yani aankannon ke bare main prashn karnaa he, jo dikaleyarative SELECT statement ke saath nishpadit kiya jaataa he
 SELECT retrieves data from one or more tables or expressions
 maanak SELECT statements kaa database par koi sthaayee prabhaav nahin hota he
 Some non-standard culminations of SELECT can have permanent effects, such as the SELECT INTO syntax that exists in some databases
 queries, upyogkartta ko vaanchit data kii vyakhya karne kii kshamta pradaan karata he, isse us parinaam ko praapt karne ke liye niyojan, ishtatameekaran or aavashyak bhautik parichaalanon ko anjaam dene kii zimmedaari database management system kii hoti he
 a query contains a list of columns to be inserted into the result immediately following the SELECT keyword
 yah nirdisht karne ke liye ki queri quarid tablon ke sabhi cholemon ko ritern kare, ek asterisk kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 SELECT is the most complex statement of SQL that also contains optional keywords and clauses
 inamen shaamil hai: The following is an example of a SELECT query that returns a list of expensive books
 queri BOOK naamak teble se un panktiyon ko praapt kar letaa he jinamein ki Price kollam main maujuud maan 100
00 se zyada he
 The result is sorted in ascending order by title
 select list main maujuud astarisk yah darshata he ki Book teble ke saare kollam rigelt set main upasthit rahane chahie
 The example below shows a query of multiple tables, groupings and aggregations, returning a list of books and the number of authors associated with each book
 udhaaharan output nimnlikhit ke jaisaa ho kata he: Under the prerequisite that only the isbn in both tables is the name of the columns with the same name and that the column named title exists only in the Books table, the above query can be rewritten as follows: haalanki, kai vendors yaa to is tareeke ko saport nahin karte, yaa phir unhen kollam namakaran kii paripaatiyon kii zaroorat hoti he
 Operators and functions are used to perform calculations on stored values in SQL
 SQL, data ko pariyojit karne ke liye select list main expreshans ke prayog kii anumati detaa he, jaisaa nimnlikhit udhaaharan main darshaya gaya he jo un pustakon kii ek suchi ritern karata he jinaki keemat 100
00 se zyada he, saath main ek atirikt cells tex kollam bhi he jisamen sales tax kaa maan maujuud he or yah maan price kaa 6% he
 The concept of null in SQL was introduced to control missing information in relational models
 tru or falls ke saath nal kii sthapana thri-vailud logic kii neenv he
 Null is a member of no value), but is a placeholder or symbol used for missing information
 isliye nal ke saath kii gayi tulanaaon kaa parinaam kabhi bhi tru yaa falls nahin ho saktaa balki yah sadaa teesraa logical parinaam- 'ananon' hota he
 SQL uses null to control missing information
 yah thri-vailud logic ko saport karata he
 The rules that regularize SQL three-valued logic are given below
 The term NULL SQL also contains a reserved keyword used to identify the particular null marker
 iske atirikt, chunki jab bhi kisi chiz kii tulana nal se hoti he to SQL operators 'ananon' ritern karte hai, isliye SQL visheshtya nal sambandhi do comperijan predicate kii suvidha pradaan karata he: IS NULL or IS NOT NULL jaanch karte hai ki data nal he yaa nahin
 Note that SQL only returns values for results for which the WHERE clause returns a true value
 yani, yah falls maan vaale parinaam apvarjit kar detaa he, lekin yah unako bhi apvarjit kar detaa he jinke maan maaloom nahin hai
 SQL does not explicitly support universal quantification and needs to be removed as 'negated exogenous quantification'
 'in phicsad camperican oparator' " IS DISTINCT FROM " bhi he jo donon oprand ke baraabar hone par yaa NULL hone par TRUE ritern karata he
 Similarly IS NOT DISTINCT FROM is defined as "NOT
 data manipulation languez, SQL kaa ek subset he jise data ko jodne, adhyatan karne or vilopan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Transactions, if available, include DML operations: ek baar jab COMMIT statement puraa ho jaataa he, to transaction main hue badlaav ko waapas nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 COMMIT and ROLLBACK terminate the current transaction and release the data locks
 ek START TRANSACTION yaa is jaise statement ke abhaav main, SQL ke cimentics karyanvayan par nirbhar hote hai
 Example: a classic bank transfer of fund transaction
 data definishan languez teble or anukramanika sanrachana kaa prabandhan karata he
 The most basic units of DDL are - CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP and TRUNCATE statements: udhaaharan: Each column of a SQL table 'declares' the types / types that can be contained in the column
 ANSI SQL main nimnlikhit datatips shaamil hai
 SQL provides a function to 'round' numbers or dates
 ise TRUNC, yaa main ROUND kaha jaataa he
 The data control language authorizes users and groups of users to access and manipulate data
 iske do mukhya statements hai: Examples: SQL ek vishisht prayojan: relational database main rakhe hue data ke queri ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 SQL is a set-based, declarative, query language, not an 'imperative Language' like c or BASIC
 However, extensions to standard SQL exist that provide the functionality of procedural programming languages, such as 'control-of-flow constructs'
 ye hai: In addition to standard SQL / PSM extensions and proprietary SQL extensions, procedural and object-oriented programming specifications can be achieved through integration with other languages of the DBMS
 SQL maanak, SQL database main java code ko saport karne ke liye, SQL / JRT ekstencens ko nirupit karata he
 SQL Server 2005 SQLCLR is used to host managed 
NET assemblies in databases, while earlier versions of SQL Server were largely limited to the use of unmanaged extended stored procedures written in C
 anya database plateforms, jaise mysql or postagrees, functionon ko parl, paythan, Tcl or c jaise vibhinn prakaar ke langwezon main likhane kii anumati dete hai
 SQL is a declarative computer language to be used with relational databases
 sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki SQL kii mul visheshtaon main se kai visheshtaayen, relational model ke cimentics or iske tapal calculas realizeshan se prerit, lekin ullanghit, the
 Recent extensions of SQL achieved relational completeness but have made the breaches worse, documents of which are available in The Third Manifesto
 SQL ke prayogtmak aalochanaon main shaamil hai: Support for basic features of standard SQL such as DATE or TIME data types is generally forgotten in most implementations of SQL
 jiske parinamswaroop, shaayad hi kabhi SQL code ko bina sanshodhano ke database systamon main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 There are several reasons behind this lack of portability in database systems: SQL ko 1986 main american naishanal standerds institute ne ek maanak ke rup main or 1987 main international organizeshan for standerdizeshan ne SQL-86 ke rup main grahan kiya
 The original SQL standard declared that the official pronunciation of SQL, "es queue el"
 kai angrezi-bolne vaale database sanvyavsaayik abhi bhi gairmanak uccharan / ˈsiːkwəl / kaa prayog karte hai
 SEQUEL, an early IBM database language, was a predecessor of the SQL language
