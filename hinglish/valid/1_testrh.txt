 Marty tries to escape by escaping into the delorean but in the meantime the car catches up to 88 mph and arrives past 5 November 1955
 1955 main marty kii bhent biff dwaara pratadit apane kishoravay pita jorge se ho jaati he
 As George is about to get hit by Lauren's father's car, Marty pushes him and gets hit by the car himself
 natiza yah hota he ki lauren jorge kii bajaae marty kii ore aakarshith ho jaati he
 Marty is disturbed by Lauren's attitude and goes to find Dock
 marty dock ko samajhaata he ki vah bhavishya se aayaa he or vah use 1985 ke kaal main lautne main madad karen
 Dock is nervous knowing that the timing device requires 1
21 ghz of power
 ve marty se kehete hai ki urja kii itani badi maatra kaa ek hi strot ho saktaa he- akashiya bizli
 marty ko yaad aata he ki agle shanivaar ko raat 10 bajkar 4 minute par adaalat ke ghantaghar ke upar bizli girane vaali he
 Doc also believes that Marty has been interrupted by his parents' visit
 vah marty se kehete hai ki use un donon ko milaane kaa upaay dhundhna chahie anyathaa vah paidaa nahin ho paaegaa
 Marty makes a plan according to which George was to come to save Lauren from her direct sexual plea on the night of the school's "enchantment under the Sea" dance
 haalanki nashe main chur biff achaanak pahunch jaataa he or marty ko car se khinchataa he or swayan ko lauren par jabardastee thopane kii koshish karata he
 According to the plan, George arrives to rescue Lauren from Marty but gets a biff at Marty's place
 biff jorge ko parrast karata he lekin jorge uske chehre par ghunsa markar use baahar gira detaa he
 The enchanted Lauren goes to the dance floor with George where they kiss each other for the first time, which now makes Marty seem certain to exist

 The lightning, which falls at 10:45 pm, is successfully delivered to Marty in 1985, but it is a little late to arrive and he is unable to save the dock from being shot
 haalanki, dock use baataate hai ki unhone bullate pruf baniyaan pahan rakhi thi or sweekaar karte hai ki unhone chitthee dabaa rakhi thi
 Doc leaves Marty home and sits in a time machine and walks towards the future
 agle subah jab marty kii neend khulti he to vah apane ghar or parivaar ko kaaphi badla hua or khushhaal paata he
 Lauren is physically fit and George is a confident science fiction writer

 ve log unnat samay yantra, jo ab ek howerkaar he or use kachare ke sanlayan dwaara urja milti he, main pravesh kar bhavishya kii ore chal padate hai
 The idea of this story came to the mind of writer and producer Bob Gayle when he went to visit his parents in Missouri after 'used Cars' was released
 apane makaan ke talaghar kii talaashi ke dauraan gail ko apane pita kii hai skool yearbuk mili jisase unhen yah pataa chalaa ki unke pita snaatak kaksha ke adhyaksh the
 Gayle thought of the president of her graduating class as someone she had nothing to do with
 gail ko khyaal aayaa ki yadi vah or unke pita saath-saath hai skool jaaya karte to vah apane pita ke dost hote
 california lautakar unhone apana yah nayaa vichaar robert zemekis ko bataaya
 Zemeckis then had the mind of a mother who complained that she could not kiss a boy in her school days, when in fact she was extremely incontinent
 ve donon is pariyojna ko colombia pikchars main le gaye or sitambar 1980 main patakatha ke liye aage kaa samjhauta kiya
 Zemeckis and Gail set the story's story in 1955 because they calculated that if a 17-year-old boy traveled to the past to meet his parents at his own age, he would have to go through that decade
 It was also the time when teenagers were emerging as an important cultural element
 yah rock en rol kaa jamaana tha or isi samay upnagareey vistaar ho rahaa tha
 All these things influence the story
 mul rup se, marty ek video jaalsaaj tha, samay yantra ek refricrator tha or use ghar lautne ke liye newada test site ke parmaanu visphot se nikali urja kaa istemaal karnaa tha
 Zemeckis was concerned that children would not accidentally close themselves in refrigerators, and that the climax of the original story was too expensive
 dealarren samay yantra kaa chayan isliye kiya gaya ki isaki banaavat se kisaanon ke pariwaron dwaara bhulvash ise udan tashtaree ke rup main lene par pratibandh lagata tha
 Before the creation of the giant guitar magnifier, the authors found it difficult to cultivate a trustworthy friendship between Marty and Doc Brown, and when she wrote the line - "it's Like I'm Kissing My Brother", only considering her motherly relationship with her mother did

 The first draft of Back to the Futures was completed in February 1981
 columbia pikchars ne film karne se inkaar kar diya
 "he believed that it was a really good, beautiful and warm film but it didn't have enough sexuality," Gayle said
 He suggested that we take it to Disney but we decided that we would take it to some big studio who would like it
 agle chaar varshon tak sabhi pramukh film studio dwaara patakatha asweekaar kii jaati rahi or is dauraan back tu da future ke do or draft taiyaar kiye gaye
 Popular teen comedies tended to be slightly lewd and adult-centric in the early 1980s, so the screenplay was often rejected due to its being of a very low level

 donon ne steven spilberg ke saath dosti ganthni chaahi jinhone yuzd cars tathaa aai vaana hold yor hand kaa nirmaan kiya tha or donon filmein asafal rahi thim
 Spielberg initially stayed away from the project because Zemeckis felt that if he made another failed film with him, he would never be able to make a film again in the future
 Gail said, "we were afraid that our image might become such that people would start thinking about us that we both have work because we are Spielberg's friends
" ek nirmaataa ne dilchaspee dikhaai magar phir apana iraadaa badal liya jab use yah pataa chalaa ki isamen spilberg shaamil nahin hai
 Zemeckis directed Romancing the Stone and the film was a box office success
 Now Zemeckis, as a high-profile director, approached Spielberg with his concept and the project was set up at Universal Pictures
 kaaryakari sidney shinberg ne patakatha par kuch suzav die

 Sheinberg wanted the film to be renamed Spacemen from Pluto because he believed that the word "future" was never used in the name of a successful film
 unhone sujhaayaa ki marty khud ko “pluto grah kaa daarth vender” ke rup main prastut kare jisaki anya grah ke praaniyon jaisi vesh-bhusha ho or vah apane pita se apni maa ke bare main puche or kisaanon kii mazaakia vastu spesamen from pluto honi chahie na ki spesazombis from pluto

 First choice for the character of Marty mcfly Michael J
 Fox was but he was busy with the Family Ties show

 May 1985 was scheduled for Back to the Future
 ab 1984 ke aakhri din the or fox kaa film main bhoomika nibhaana mumkin nahin tha
 Zemeckis' other two choices were C
 Thomas Howell and Eric Stolz
 erik stols ne mask film main roy el
 denis ke apane kirdaar se nirmaataaon ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki unhone uskaa chayan marty mikefly kaa kirdaar nibhaane ke liye kar liya
 The start date was pushed twice due to the difficult casting process
 chaar hafte kii shooting ke baad zemekis ko laga ki stols apane kirdaar ke liye sahi nahin he
 Although he and Spielberg knew that re-shooting would mean an additional $ 3 million increase in the $ 14 million budget, they decided to switch to shooting
 spilberg ne samajhaayaa ki zemekis ko lagata tha ki stols main hasyabodh kii kami thi or uskaa abhinay buree tarah se naatakeey tha
 Gale further revealed that she felt Stolz was playing the role in a normal way while Fox had a personality similar to Marty mcfly's
 unhen laga sket board par sawari karne main stols ko asuvidha hoti thi jabaki fox ko nahin
 Two weeks after the shooting began, Stolz once confessed to director Peter Bagdanovich while talking on the phone that he did not understand the direction of Zemeckis and Gayle and that he was not suitable for the role

 fox ko patakatha pasand ai or stols ko jis samvedansheeltaa ke saath hataaya gaya use lekar zemekis or gail se vah bahut prabhavit hue kyonki stols ke bare main ve donon aadar ke saath baaten karte the
 But Waylander and Tony Hawk collaborated in the skate board ride scene, although Hawke had to leave the film because he was taller than Fox and in many scenes he played for Stolz
 fox ko marty mikefly kii apni bhoomika bahut hi nijee lagi
 “I used to do all this during my high school days - riding a skateboard, chasing girls and playing in the music troupe
 My dream was to become a rock star
 " pehali pasand ke rup main jon lithgo ke hat jane ke baad christopher leod ne dock brown kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 She was advised by producer Neil Canton to do the role after working with Lyd at The Adventures of Bakaru Banjai
 leod ne shuru main yah karne se manaa kar diya lekin patakatha padhane ke baad or apni patni ke jid karne par vah raji ho gaye
 He improved some of his scenes, drawing inspiration from Albert Einstein and operator Leopold Stokowski

 After Stolz left, Fox's schedule on weekdays was to shoot family tides during the day and back to the future from 6:30 in the evening to 2:30 at night
 prayek raat unhen ausatan keval 5 ghante kii neend mil paati thi
 On Fridays he used to shoot from 10 pm to 6 am and then on weekends for film scenes as he could only be available during the day
 fox ke liye yah behad thakanpurn tha, lekin unke shabdon main “film or television ke vyavsaay main hona meraa sapana tha, haalanki mujhe yah kahaan maaloom tha ki kabhi donon ke liye ek saath kaam karnaa hoga
 mujhe mauka mila or maine use sweekaar kar liya
 Dubbing Back to the Future, Zemeckis said "this film will never stop"
 He recalls that because he used to shoot every night, his condition was always "half asleep, half awake" and at the same time his obesity increased and he felt ill
 hill vaili shahar ke chauraahey kaa drishy courtouse squer par filmaaya gaya tha jo universal studios ke peeche sthit tha
 Bob Gayle pointed out that shunting at the location would have been impossible because no city allowed the film city to reconstruct the city in such a way that it would become the 1950s
 The filmmakers decided to film the 50s scene first and make the city truly beautiful and spectacular
 And then later, after removing everything to make the city scene unattractive and ugly in the 80s
