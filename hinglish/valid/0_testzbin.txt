 Therefore, all the movements related to it were mainly poetry movements
 haalaanki kahani evam anya vidhaon par bhi iskaa asar paryaapt rup se padaa or kahani ke kshetra main bhi 'akahani' jaise aandolan ne rup dhaaran kiya
 Around sixty, the stream of new poetry began to look somewhat different from itself
 saath ke baad jo nayaa mode lakshith hota he vah ekaek deekhne vaali koi naveen vastu nahin, varan nayi kavita se hi phuta hua he
 The tone of discontent, disapproval and rebellion has emerged very clearly in the later sixties
 nayi kavita main bhi asantosh or asweekruti kaa swar vidyaman he, kintu saath ke baad is swar ne or tikhe vyangy or vidroh kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he, jivan kii tuutati murtiyon ke bahut kareeb jaakar unki tuutane kii talkhi, vyathaa or usamen se footati asweekruti kii ugrata ko pahachaanaa he
 The greatest feature of the new poem is that it conveyed authentic experiences of the whole life in their living environment
 vishay yaa anubhuti ke abhijatya or bhinn-bhinn drushtiyon yaa vaadon se bane hue unke gheron ko todakar vyakti dwaara bhoge jate hue jivan ke har chote-bade satya ko pratikon or bimbon ke madhyam se ubhaarne main hi usne kavita kii sarthakata samajhi
 But overall, despite the pain in the poets of the new poem, there remained a positive hope for future creation
 swatantryottar bharat kii tatkaaleen paristhitiyon ke kaaran unamem hataasha or tuutan kaa bhav kaaphi tha parantu sapane puure hone kii ek ksheen aashaa bhi bachi rahi thi
 Disillusionment or disillusionment did not occur as a whole, so the new poem has a sense of torture, a tone of disapproval, but not a revolt
 dhire-dhire 'ilugen' ek dam tut gayi, mohabhang ho gaya
 The social environment of the person started to look more ugly, dreams of the future were broken
 dow0 bachchan singh ke shabdon main kaviyon ke ugaae hue suraj main roshni nahin aayi-- surya kaa swaagat vyarth chalaa gaya
 Many litterateurs began to see only two ways that either they would express the intense feeling of pain by adding tone to the head of the new poem, or all these circumstances would make their sensitive mind emerge from the midst of torture and torture
 Everything started to inspire rejection
 sahitya main ye donon dharaayen raheen, parantu san saath ke turat baad vidrohi dhara pradhan rahi jinamein se adhikansh nirlakshya yaa yon-vikrutilakshi thim
 By being objective, these poems were conveniently revolting, that is, where there was a danger in rebellion, there was rebellion where there was convenience
 saathottaree hindi sahitya kaa pehla dashak aadhuniktawaad se vishesh prabhavit he
 It is important to note that there is a difference between modern and modernity
 'aadhunik' 'madhyakaalin' se alag hone kii soochna detaa he
 'modern' is the result of scientific inventions and industrialization while 'modernism' is the result of excesses of industrialization, metropolitan monotony, the catastrophe of two great wars
 dow0 bachchan singh ke anusaar "vastutah naveen gyaan-vigyaan, technology ke falswaroop utpann visham maanviya sthitiyon ke naye, gaiyr-romentic or amithkeey saakshaatkaar kaa naam 'aadhuniktaa' he
 " aadhuniktaavaadi sahitya ek vishesh prakaar kaa sahitya he
 It rejects established culture, values and sensibilities
 yah duniya kii manyataon ko manjuur nahin karti, parampara ko bedi ke rup main leti he
 The modernist undertakes interludes, mocking the values, he is a rebel
 bheed kaa virodh karata he, vah vyakti kii mukti kaa vishwasi he
 He finds himself in a non-human condition, and expels affection, gratitude etc
 sanyam kii kami, prayog, sahitya roopon kii tod-phod, shock dene kii manovriti, aakrosh-kshobh-hinsa kii aakanksha aadi isaki visheshtaayen yaa 'motiff' hai
 Among the many trends that have been active in the poetry field, experiencing the isolation from the new poem, the most notable is Ginsberg, Rajkamal Chaudhary emerging in Hindi parallel to American Beatnik and hungry poets like Malay Raychaudhuri and Subimal Basak of Bengal influenced by them
 Some other poets related to poetry and rejected poetry who wrote about 'hetero sexuality' and 'open secrecy'
 Specific assumptions made by adopting an attempt to your 'disfiliatt' society
 unki kavita main yon shabdaawalee kaa nanga prayog, apane vikshobh or aakrosh ko vyakt karne ke liye praayah ek sanskarahinta evam vikruti ke rup main miltaa he
 Rajkamal Chaudhary has been considered the leading poet of this decade
 raajakmal choudhary main aadhuniktaa apni samagrata main dikhaai padati he
 Chaudhary's imprint can be seen on most of the compositions of this time
 bitanic aandolan hindi main ek fishan kii tarah aayaa or kuch hi samay main nishprerak ho gaya kyonki uski jaden desh ke yatharth main nahin thim
 Actually he was a poet of anger
 apni aakroshpurna vaani main ye apana gussa utaarte rahe
 He continued to express his screams, wounds and sexual innuendo in poetry, rejecting all the previous values and traditions
 parantu, yuyutsavadi, nav pragatisheel yaa nav pragativaadee kaviyon ne saamaajik mulyon par bal dete hue in bitanicon se apni asahmati vyakt kii
 After the new poem, so many slogans were heard in a short period in the field of Hindi poetry, so many movements came that no other literature of the world had such a lot of slogans and movements in such a short period
 inamen se kuch andolan or naare to samay kii gard main hi dab gayi kintu kuch vikaas ke path par bade bhi
 In fact, the nutritious compositions of these movements were also similar to each other and sometimes the same poet followed many movements
 sahitya-rachana kaa yah samay andolanon kii arajak baadh kaa samay rahaa
 The names of these movements are mainly poem-oriented
 is dashak main baadh kii tarah aaye kavita-andolanon main vyavastha-virdohi andolanon ke saath-saath vyavastha-samarthak kai andolan bhi the; parantu praayah in sabhi andolanon main suvyavasthit chintan kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran praayah ye sabhi laghujivi siddh hue
 The general introduction of both these types of main movements is visible in the following headings
 march 1962 ke 'bharti' ke ank main srivirendrakumar jain ne 'sanathan suryodayi' nayi kavita kii ghoshnaa kii
 Expressing his intentions, he said that "we are wandering in the shadowless direction of fall-defeat, frustration, complacency and living suicides, in the face of the destitute poetic consciousness
 Carrying in, taking in nectar from death and taking away the leel of limitless in the border - the imperative Sanatan Suryodayi Nutan Kavita stream of tomorrow to come free We do
 " is prakaar is andolan kaa mukhya swar vyavastha kaa hi tha, parantu lagbhag 3 saal baad hi 'bharti' ke hi farvari 1965 i0 ke ank main 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke sthaan par 'nutan kavita' kaa swar sunai dene laga
 Former supporters of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita' like Gangaprasad Vimal joined themselves in the 'akavita' category
 yuyutsavadi kavita kaa sambandh 'yuyutsa' naamak patrika se rahaa he
 Shalabh Sriram Singh was the originator of the Yutaswadi poetry
 unki manyata rahi he ki aadim yuyutsa hi sahityasarjan kii mul prerana he
 He says that "I accept the same primitive youth as the original inspiration for literature, which has been at the core of every revolution, change or dissolution somewhere
 vah yuyutsa jijeevishaavaadi, mumurshavadi, vidrohatmak athwa platonic kuch bhi ho sakati he
 "in 'roopambra' of April 1965, under the 'commencement', this quote of Shalabh Sriram Singh was given by the Swadesh Indians while declaring 'yuyotsa is the only cause of all'"
 'roopambara' ke hi agast 1966 ke 'adhunathan kavita ank' main 'yuyutsavadi navlekhan pradhan sahakaari prayaas' ke rup main saamne aayaa, teen kaviyon ke vaktavy sahit
 The editor also raised the issue of new sensibilities
 vimal pandeya, rameshwaradutt maanav, om prabhakar, bajrang bishnoi aadi ne bhi apane aap ko is andolan se sambandhit kiya
 Vimal Pandey tried to associate 'yuyotsavada' with 'angry Young Man'
 shri om prabhakar ne 'yuddhechha' ko sanathan vritti maanate hue yuyutsa ko jijeevishaa kaa paryaay mana he
 Bajrang Bishnoi has linked the question of commitment to Yuyutsa
 'utkarsh' patrika ke july '66 ke ank main shriram shukla ne 'asweekrut kavita' kaa naaraa buland kiya or 'ek lambii asweekrut kavita' 'mari hui aurat ke saath sambhog' sheershak se prastut kii
 For Shukla ji, the experience of sexual intercourse is enough - to carry seven epics
 ' asweekrut kavita ke pravaktaa kavi kii manyata he-- "satya ko satya na kah paane kii vishmata kabhi na kabhi avrodh todakar bah nikalati he or tabhi janm hota he asweekrut kavita kaa
 "and" is a communicative poem of specific tendencies, emotions, situations, values, inconsistencies and moods, disproved in the present era, but also rejected
 " asweekrut kavita yon vikrutiyon kii kavita he
 The use of vulgar words is readily accepted for them and according to them they are anxious to 'change disliked arrangements'
 hal na prastut kar sake to bhi 'un par prashn chihn lagaakar besudh logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa' ye apana kartavya samajhate hai
 Dr
 Shyam Parmar, the narrator of 'akvita', has been considered, but Jagdish Chaturvedi was also an equal partner with him and was among the early proponents of 'akvita'
 vastutah 'akavita' patrika ke teen sampadak the-- jagadish chaturvedi, shyaam parmaar or rabindranath tyaagi
 Theoretical articles in support of Akvita were often not published in 'akvita' magazine
 un logon kii manyata thi kii 'baat bolegi ham nahin'
 However, Dr
 Shyam Parmar also wrote a book titled 'akvita and art-references' in support of Akvita, which attempted to define multiple verses
 jagadish chaturvedi is varg ke kaviyon ke dwaara bauddhik str par jeeye gayi jivan kii ekangita, visangati tathaa kachot ko sapraan abhivyakti pradaan karne kii sachetanta ke kaaran tathaa kavy kii puraatan parampara se pruthakta ke kaaran is kavy ko 'abhinav kavy' kii sangya dete hue kehete hai ki "unhen 'anti-kavy' ke saarth-vaahakon ke rup main pariganit kiya ja saktaa he
 "but Shyam Parmar does not consider Akvita as anti-poetry or anti-poetry
 ve akavita ko 'antarvirodhon kii anveshak kavita' maanate hai
 According to him, the specialty of this poetry movement is in the fact that "the tendencies of poets are associated with different mindsets"
 " "akavita kaldharmee kavita he
 It will be a limited-time poem, as it will not have to hoist flags in the future
 " tathaa "akavita main abhivyakti ke anek str sambhav hai
 In language and narrative, he is not committed, hence 'flexible'
 usamen jatil or 'tipsi' prakriyaayein hai-- sidhi or tuuti baaten hai
 "akavita's spokesperson Kavi also mentions that" new poetry or newcomers are not worthy of opposition to Akavita
 aandolan vritti ke log vyarth hi ise gut yaa shadyantr kii sangya dete hai
 " akavita ke andolan ko bhi bitanic aandolan ke saath jude hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 However, its proponents Jagdish Chaturvedi and Shyam Parmar described the behavior of the Beatnikis as blasphemous and absolutely denied their involvement with 'akvita'
 san 1965 se 67 tak nikalne vaali 'akavita' patrika ke prastaavkon main girijakumar maathur, prabhakar machave, bharat bhushan agarwal, vimal or atul aadi ke naam bhi saamne aaye the
 In this context, the works of Saumitra Mohan and Mudrarakshas are also notable
 america bitanic prabhaav ke kaaran dow0 prabhakar machave, bangla prabhaav ke kaaran raajakmal choudhary tathaa ginsvarg ke prabhaav ke kaaran trilochan or shamsher bahadur singh ne bhi beet kavita se apane aap ko sambhddha kiya tha
 In magazines called 'kriti' and 'expression', Machwe ji also declared his belief
 elahabaad se prakashit 'vidrohi peedi' ke kaviyon par bhi apratyaksh rup se yah prabhaav dikhaa
 Laxmikant Varma was the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 verma ji pehle 'nayi kavita' ke bade samarthakon main se the
 He wrote the first important book related to the theoretical analysis of new poetry, 'paradigms of new poetry'
 parantu, baad main manyata badalane par ve 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak bane
 She started the movement of 'fresh poetry' because in the new poem, there was no longer any 'newness' and she had become distinguished in a particular way
 verma ji kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki "nayi kavita kaa adhikansh paroksh rup se nabhinal dwaara chhayavaad se jeevanshkti letaa rahaa tha
 "however, even this movement of 'fresh poetry' could not go on
 july 1965 tak main hi verma ji kaa saath nibhaane vaala koi ek kavi yaa lekhak bhi saamne nahin aayaa or "bina kisi shor-gul ke, 'taaji kavita' ke tajie apane aap dafn ho gayi
 " patibaddh kavita ke saath dow0 parmanand shrivastav kaa naam judaa hua he
 Dr
 Srivastava's belief is: "I believe that there is no other option in front of Kavita to interview the entire humanitarian of today and fight against the dehumanization induced by the capitalist system
 " tathaa "patibaddh kavita ke daayre main 'bhashaa' ek mahatvapurn astr he-- uparyukt sangharsh kaa
 "dr
 Srivastava has also further defined the nature of the struggle--" Conflict is a straightforward and meaningful word in committed poetry - it has no disguise - people who do not accept any kind of commitment create false conflict and Let's enjoy it

 Dr
 Shyam Parmar and Rajkamal Chaudhary also supported it
 march 1967 main sahaj kavita kii vijyapti prakashit hui
 The excerpts of the communiqué are as follows: "after the '60s, the craftsmanship of manorism in a class was considered to be the original goal and Hindi poetry emerged as a trade of crooked lines altogether
 isiilie vah fishan rahi he or bahut arthpurna bhi nahin xxrep 4 
 "so the goal of this poem is to" search for poetry from afresh "

 Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar defined Sahaja poetry in his article as follows - "the etymological meaning of the word 'sahaj' in the context presented will have to be 'saha jayate iti sahajah
 ' arthath jo rachana yatharth anubhuti samveg ke saath vaani ke moort madhyam main janm leti he, vah sahaj he
 From this point of view, authenticity of cognition is the primary object
 anubhuti pratyaksh tathaa pramanik hui to abhivyakti akrutrim or ajatil hogi
 "and" Sahaja's demand is social, despite being objective
 " dow0 bhramar ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko bhi sahaj kavita ke saath sambhddha karke dekha he : "apane yug ke jivan or sarjanaatmak daayitv se sahaj kavita puri tarah patibaddh he
 At its core lies the realization of simple life and a sincere effort to search for a medium of simple craft
 " The name of the new song appeared in a magazine called 'geetangini' published from Muzaffarpur in February 1958
 is patrika main kuch navagit bhi sankalit the
 Some authors consider the development of the new song to be parallel to the new poem and consider it to be a special genre of new poetry
 'navagit' kaa pratham samavet sankalan 'kavita' 1964 main om prabhakar ke sampadan main prakashit hua
 With this, Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar, Ramdarsha Mishra and Dr
 Ramesh Kuntal appeared as spokespersons of the Megh Navgita

 In 1908, Malus discovered the polarization of light by rotation, and three years later Arago discovered the crystal to be light-active
 1815 i

 Specific rotation - The specific rotation of a lightly active substance is represented by the equation, which is the specific rotation for wavelength l and t degrees of light, and a is the fraction of the rotation of light, from a tube 1 cm long
 The light was obtained by going through it and d per cubic cm of the light-activated object filled in the tube
 Is the concentration

 This second type of crystal is called mirror reflection
 inako jab mishran se pruthak kiya gaya to iskaa jaleey vilyan vamavart tha
 The crystal of acid obtained from it was also in the form of mirror reflection of crystal of tartaric acid and the solution was also counterclockwise
 isliye is amla ko tarterik amla kaa doosraa rup samajha gaya
 Their crystals are asymmetric: yah paaya gaya ki keval ve hi crystal tathaa anu, jinke darpan pratibimb adhyaropit nahin hote, prakaashat: sakriy hote hai
 Such a structure is called asymmetric
 bahut se padaarth thos avasthaa main hi prakaashat: sakriy hote hai, jaise sphatik, sodium chloret aadi
 The first known, optically active substance is crystalline, whose crystals are of two types, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise
 ye donon crystal ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb hai or adhyaropit nahin hote
 Such pairs of crystals are called reflection forms
 sphatik ke galane par isaki sakriyata lupt ho jaati he
 Hence the photosynthetic activation of the crystal is due to its asymmetric crystal structure
 is varg ke padaarth prakaashat: sakriy tabhi tak rahete hai jab tak ve thos rup main hote hai or galane par, vashpikaran se tathaa vilyan main inaki sakriyata nasht ho jaati he
 Many compounds are also lightly active in solid, melting, gaseous or solution states, such as glucose, tartaric acid, etc
 inaki sakriyata yogic kii amamit aanvik sanrachana ke kaaran hoti he
 This molecule and its mirror image are called reflection forms, optical antithesis or optical isomers
 keval do baton ko chhodkar, ye rup bhautik gunon main ek se hote hai
 They give equal and opposite rotation with the same polarized light and have different absorption coefficients with other clockwise and counterclockwise circularly polarized light
 pratibimb roopon ke rasinic gun ek se hote hai par kisi duusare prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke saath kii abhikriya main praaia: antar hota he
 There may also be differences in physiological activity, such as histidine being sweet and histidine tasteless; Nicotine is more toxic than nicotine
 san 1874 main waant hof or le bal ne carbonic yogicon kii prakaashat: samavyawata ke astitv kaa samaadhaan kiya
 Want Half considered that the four valency of carbon is directed towards the four ends of a trigon and the carbon atom is located in the middle of the tetrahedral
 is siddhant ke anusaar methen ke chaaron hydrogen parmaanu samaan honge, jise bhautik or rasinic kriyaaon dwaara siddh bhi kiya gaya
 Earlier in 1858 AD, it was understood that all the four valencies of carbon are in a plane and the carbon atom is at the center of this square
 CX4 anu main carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaayen samaan hai or yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki trivim main inkaa samamit vinyas he
 Thus three arrangements may be possible - planar, pyramidal and tetrahedral
 yadi anu ekataleey ho, to yogic c a b d e ke teen rup sambhav ho sakate hai
 If the molecule is pyramidi, six forms of this compound may be possible
 yadi anu chatushfalkeey he, to yogic c a b d e ke do rup hi sambhav honge or donon ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb honge
 In fact the compound c abde is obtained only in a couple image form, which confirms tetrahedron molecule structure
 jab carbon main sanyojit chaaron samooh bhinn-bhinn hote hai, tab aise carbon ko asamamit carbon kehete hai
 Photosensitively active organic compounds must have one, or more than one, asymmetric carbon atom
 asamamit carbon yogic ke c a b d e donon pratibimb rup jab Ca2 bd main badal jate hai, to keval ek hi prakaashat: niskriy padaarth praapt hota he, jaise dakshinavart or vamavart donon lactic amla avakrut hokar ek hi propionic amla dete hai
 This confirms tetrahedral carbon
 runtgen kiran ke crystalakeey vishleshan, dwidhruv adhurna, avasorana spectrum tathaa electron vivartan ke adhyayan bhi carbon ke chatushfalkeey prakruti kii pushti karte hai
 By mathematical calculation, the angle between any two valency of carbon was 109 ° 28 min
 pehle yah vichaar tha ki yah sanyojak kone sthaayee rahata he, par ab gyaat he ki sanyojaktaa kaa apane sthaan se vichlan ho saktaa he or is kaaran is kone main bhi parivartan ho saktaa he
 When all four atoms or groups associated with a carbon atom are one, this angle is certainly 109 degrees 28 minutes, as in methane, CH4, or carbon tetrachloride, ccl4
 lekin methilin chloride CH2 Cl2, main kone 112 degree paaya jaataa he, kyonki chlorine ke bade parmaanuon ke pratikarshi bal ke kaaran sanyojaktaa kone main adhik failaav sambhav he
 The main difference in isomers with an asymmetric carbon atom is in their optical activation
 donon pratibimb roopon ke ghurnan ke chihr main hi keval antar hota he
 Therefore, they are also known as antiquarianism
 lactic amla, CH3
CHOH
COOH, ke anu ke keval do hi prakaashat: sakriy samaavyavi hai, jo aapas main ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb hote hai
 These are called dectro - and levo - lactic acid
 baraabar anupaaton main donon roopon kaa mishran prakaashat: niskriy hota he, kyonki donon pratibimb roopon kaa ghurnan samaan tathaa disha vipareet hoti he
 Such molecules, homogeneous mixtures, which are externally repulsed and lightly inert, are called racemic metamorphs
 aise racemic yogicon ko r athwa dl- upsargon dwaara nideshit kiya jaataa he
 Thus a compound with an asymmetric carbon atom can be obtained in three forms
 in samaavyaviyon kii sambhaavna asamamit carbon parmaanu par hi nirbhar he
 Asymmetry of carbon disappears, both optical activation and isomerism disappear
 sakriy mailic amla ke donon roopon ke avakrut karne par niskriy saxinic amla, HOOC
CH2
CH2
COOH, praapt hota he
 As the number of asymmetric carbon atoms in compounds increases, the possibility of more isomeric forms increases
 saadhaaran dasha main ek asamamit yogic ke, jisamen sankhya da asamamit carbon parmaanu hon, prakaashat: sakriy samaavayavon kii sankhya 2n ho sakati he or 2n-1 pratibimb rooponnau ke jode, arthath 2n racemic rup honge
 Compounds having two different asymmetric carbon atoms have the capacity of 2 x 2 i
e
 four forms
 inamen do jode honge or prati jode main ek duusare ke samaan or vipareet chihravaale ghurnan honge
 There will also be two racemic forms from both pairs
 is prakaar ke udhaaharan cinemic acid dibromide, C6H5
 c h Br
 chbr
 COOH, he, jo chaar prakaashat: sakriy roopon tathaa do racemic roopon main prapya he
 Compounds, both of which have the same asymmetric carbon atoms, are found in three configurations, with two optically active reflection forms, and the third intermittently inactive and cannot have differentiated active forms
 inke alaava donon sakriy roopon se ek racemic rup bhi utpann hota he
 The substance directed by the number 3
 is apparently inactive
 yadhyapi isamen do sakriy carbon hai, tathaapi ve ek-duusare ko prabhaavaheen karte hai, kyonki unka ghurnan samaan or vipareet he
 This intermittent molecule is called i or meso form
 niskriy tathaa avibhedit rup un yogicon main sambhav nahin he jinamein ek hi asamamit carbon parmaanu ho
 It differs from racemic forms, which can be distinguished from their photosynthetic forms
 is prakaar kaa sabase uttam udhaaharan diahydrosxinic amla he, jisamen do samaan asamamit carbon hai or jiskaa aitihaasik drushti se bahut mahatv he
 According to the theory, it is obtained from the same mixture of forms southward, counterclockwise and meso-tartaric acid
 dakshinvart or vamavart prakaashat: prativinyasi hai tathaa meso or racemic niskriy hai
 Their structures can be shown as follows: ek jode pratirupon ke baraabar mishran ko racemic rup kehete hai
 This form can occur for the following reasons: baraabar maatra main donon pratirupon ko milaane se
 Synthesis of asymmetric compounds gives a racemic form
 ek prakaashat: sakriy yogic ko racemic rup main parivartan karne kii kriya ko rapeemikaran kehete hai
 Often the + and - forms of compounds can be inhibited by the effects of heat, light and chemical reagents
 parivartan kii kriya yogic or abhikarmakon ke upar nirbhar karti he
 Some compounds are so easy and rapid that they cannot be obtained in an active form
 kuch thode se aise yogic hai jo resimikrut nahin hote
 Differentiation is the action whereby both its reflection forms are separated by a racemic transformation
 vastav main inkaa maatraatmak pruthakkaran bahut hi kam hota he or kuch main to keval ek hi praturup kii prapti hoti he
 Some methods of differentiation are as follows: yantric pruthakkaran - paister ne us vidhi kaa pataa lagaaya jiske anusaar donon pratirupon ke crystal alag alag hote hai or ve haathon se alag kiye ja sakate hai
 Pastor gave sodium ammonium tartrate at 28 degrees Celsius
 By crystallizing, both types of crystals were separated by tongs
 is vidhi kaa upyog bada simit he
 Desiccated Crystallon by Insertion - When a crystal of a reflection form is added to an over saturated solution of a racemic mixture, it is first a crystal of the same reflection form and thus a separation of that form can occur
 jivaracinic vibhedan - kuch jeevanu yaa faphund jab kisi racemic ke tanu vilyan par ugaae jate hai, tab ye ek pratibimb rup ko duusare kii apeksha shighrata se nasht karte hai
 Thus a reflection form can be obtained after a specified time
 penicellium glukam jab racemic ammonium tarteret ke vilyan par ugaaya jaataa he, to pehle dectro rup nasht ho jaataa he or livo batch jaataa he
 Chemical Differentiation - This method is the best
 isamen racemic yogic ke pratibimb roopon ko kisi prakaashat: sakriy yogic se upachaarit karte hai, taaki ve paraspar milakar aise yogic bane jinka pruthakkaran saralata se kiya ja sake
 The salts that will be formed by treating the acidic acid with a lightly active base, some of the salts will be + acids and + bases and some salts - acids and + bases
 inke gunon main vibhinnata rah sakati he, jinase ve crystalan dwaara pruthak kiye ja sakate hai
 Selective absorption - Selective absorption of photosensitively active substances can occur by a particular optically active absorber
 anek rasayanagyon ne iske dwaara vibhedan sampann kiya he
 The clockwise and counterclockwise reflection forms were previously directed by the Dactro and Levo prefixes, respectively
 isi bhanti dectry tarterik or livo tarterik amla kaha jaataa tha
 Wanthoff has used the + and - signs to denote the configuration of asymmetric carbon
 baad main fisher ne prastaav kiya ki d or l upsargon kaa prayog unki vinyas sthiti ke liye kiya jaae or inkaa prayog ghurnan kii disha ke liye na kiya jaae
 The sign of rotation of an optically active substance can often be reversed by changes in the experimental condition, and likewise the sign of their kinetics, whose configuration is the same, can also be opposite to the direction of rotation, such as counterclockwise lactic acid salts
 And esters are clockwise and counterclockwise of lactic acid
 in sab kaarnon se vichaar kiya gaya ki prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke liye aise chihn kaa upyog kiya jaae jo sidhe vinyas kii sthiti kaa bodh karaae or yah chihn uske ghurnan disha ke chihn se swatantra ho
 Glyceraldehyde, which has an asymmetric carbon atom, is obtainable in two reflection forms and according to a voluntary determination that the clockwise form shows that the hydroxyl, -OH, carbon of the group is on the right and the hydrogen atom is on the right side
 chatushfalkeey carbon kii vyavastha ke anusaar hydrogen or hydroxil samooh prishth kii sataha se upar he tathaa -CHO or -CH2OH samooh prishth kii sataha se neeche
 This configuration of glyceraldehyde is called D
 prachlit reeti ke anusaar padi rekha dwaara sanyojit samooh prishth kii sataha se upar he
 Like this, there are signs of its state of reflection
 is D- glissraldihide ke pramanik vinyas se sambandhit vinyas D-shrenee ke anrtgat aate hai, arthath ve yogic, jo D- glissraldihide se praapt ho sakate hai, yaa rasinic kriya se D- glissraldihide main parivartit kiye ja sakate hai, D-shrenee main aate hai
 In this way, glyceraldehyde has the full name d glyceraldehyde and l glyceraldehyde
 or isaki ghurnan disha kaa sanket karte hai
 Their aldehyde group can be converted to the next homogeneous - CHOH - CHO and will give each glyceraldehyde two forms as it has an asymmetric carbon
 carbon yogicon main jab ek samooh duusare samooh dwaara pratisthapit hota he, tab yah samajha jaataa he ki pratisthaapak hataae hue samooh kaa sthaan letaa he
 If a lightly active compound changes from a simple substitution reaction to a b compound, their configurations are one
 yah satya he, par kabhi-kabhi pratisthaapan ke saath saath vinyas main parivartan bhi ho jaataa he
 This configuration change is called the optical inversion, or the Walden inversion by the name of the inventor Walden
 iskaa ek saral udhaaharan chlorosxinic amla main chlorine kaa pratisthaapan hydroxil samooh se hone par, mailic amla praapt hota he tathaa potacium hydroxide ke prayog se dakshinvarti amla praapt hota he 1204 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 1204 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 1204 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 Abdurrahim Khankhana was born in 1613 AD in history Lahore, home of the famous Bairam Khan
 sanyog se us samay humayun sikandar suri kaa akraman kaa pratirodh karne ke liye sainya ke saath lahore main maujuud the
 Hearing the news of the birth of Bairam Khan's son, he himself went there and named the child "rahim"
 rahim ke pita bairam khan teraa varshiya akbar ke atali tathaa abhibhavak the
 Bairam Khan was conferred with the title of khan-e-khana

 Rahim's mother was Sultana Begum, a beautiful and quality girl from Jamal Khan, a Mewati Rajput in present-day Haryana province
 jab rahim paanch varsh ke hi the, tab gujarat ke patan nagar main san 1561 main inke pita bairam khan kii hatya kar di gai
 Rahim was raised by Akbar like his son
 shahi khandaan kii paramparanuroop rahim ko 'mirza khan' kaa kitaab diya gaya
 Rahim studied intensively under the supervision of Baba Jambur

 Bairam Khan gave full support in strengthening Akbar's kingdom with efficient policy
 kisi karanvash bairam khan or akbar ke bich matbhed ho gaya
 Akbar successfully suppressed the rebellion of Bairam Khan and expressed his desire to go on Haj, keeping the honor and honor of his master
 parinamswarup bairam khan haj ke liye ravaanaa ho gayi
 Bairam Khan stayed in Patan, Gujarat, and sat on the beach after boating at Patan's famous Sahasraling Sarovar, with the intention of offering an Afghan chieftain Mubarak Khan and deceitfully killed Bairam Khan
 yah mubarak khan ne apane pita kii mrityu kaa badla lene ke liye kiya
 This incident made Bairam Khan's family an orphan

 Widow Sultana Begum, along with some of her servants, escaped to Ahmedabad
 akbar ko ghatana ke bare main jaise hi maaloom hua, unhone sultanaa begum ko darbar waapas aane kaa sandesh bhej diya
 After getting the message on the way, Begum entered Akbar's court
 aise samay main akbar ne apane mahanata kaa saboot dete hue inako badi udaartaa se sharan diya or rahim ke liye kaha “ise sab prakaar se prasann rakho
 He must not know that his father, Khan Khana is no more

 Rahim's education - initiation was in accordance with Akbar's liberal secular policy
 isi shiksha-diksha ke kaaran rahim kaa kavy aaj bhi hindooon ke gale kaa kaniihaar bana hua he
 According to Dinkar Ji's statement, Rahim gave many times more space in his poems than the place Akbar gave to Hinduism in his deen-elahi
 rahim ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah dharm se musalmaan or samskruti se shuddh bhartiya the
 After the abolition of Rahim's education, Emperor Akbar, while following the tradition of his father Humayun, got Rahim married to Mahaban, sister of Mirza Aziz Koka, Bairam Khan's adversary
 is vivaah main bhi akbar ne vahi kiya, jo pehle karata rahaa tha ki vivaah ke sambandhon ke badaulat aapasi tanaav va puraani se puraani katutaa ko samaapt kar diya karata tha
 Because of Rahim's wedding Beram Kha and Mirza's ongoing estrangement is finished
 rahim kaa vivaah lagbhag solah saal kii umr main kar diya gaya tha
 One of the principal posts to Akbar's court was the post of Mir Arj
 yah pad paakar koi bhi vyakti raaton raat amir ho jaataa tha, kyonki yah pad aisa tha, jisase pahunchakar hi janata kii fariyaad samraat tak pahunchati thi or samraat ke dwaara liye gaye faisle bhi isi pad ke jariye janata tak pahunchaae jate the

 After much effort and blessings, Akbar could get a boy, whom he named Salim, with the blessings of Sheikh Salim Chishti
 shahjada saleem maan-baap or duusare logon ke adhik dulaar ke kaaran shiksha ke prati udasin ho gaya tha
 Akbar got many great people engaged in Salim's education

 The king is killed when a peasant suppresses the rebellion, while Einon goes to claim his crown and is accidentally wounded by the mortal peasant girl Kara
 einon kii maa rani eslin, vah uski jaan bachaane ke liye prarthana karnaa jise ek dragon se pehle use le liya he
 The Dragon replaces Ein's damaged heart with a piece of his own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue
 haalanki, einon jald hi purv vidrohiyon vash main rakhana or unhen ek roman mahal ke punarnirmaan ke liye majaboor kar rahaa he, apane pita kii tulana main adhik atyaachaari ho jaataa he
 Bowen believes that the dragon's heart twisted ain and swore vengeance on all the dragons

 Brother Gilbert, a monk and aspiring poet, sees a dragon killing Bowen and follows him to record his exploits

 The Dragon states that this is the last of its kind and Bowen kills it as follows, he will be out of a job

 Bowen says Draco, after the constellation of stars

 Kara asks Bowen to help oust Ain, but the disillusioned Knight refuses
 boven or dreko kii agali dragon kii hatya kharaab ho jaataa he kaa manchan kiya or unke chunaav avgat karaayaa he

 Einon discovers that he is effectively immortal as long as Draco stays alive and the dragon determines to keep him captive
 eslin raat dauraan dreko ko maarane ke liye prayaas karata he, lekin einon vah use martha he, to use band ho jaataa he
 Bowen also begs to kill him as the rebels invade the Ainon's castle and Draco is the only way to end the reign of the Ainans

 Many subtle questions arise about this topic, such as why is it that when one man tells a joke, people laugh but when they tell another, they do not laugh? It is believed that stress fluctuations have a very important contribution in many jokes
 jaise ki ek chutkula he ki - Initially in this latte, tension arises due to crazy running
