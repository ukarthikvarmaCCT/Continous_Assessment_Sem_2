 He was the chief among those who worked for the right to information
 jan lokapal vidheyak ko paarit karaane ke liye anna ne 16 agast 2011 se aamaran anshan armbh kiya tha
 Anna Hazare was born on 15 June 1937 in a Maratha peasant family of village Ralegan Siddhi in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra

 iske baad unhone phulon kii apni dukaan khol lee or apane do bhaaiyon ko bhi ralegan se bula liya
 After the india-china war in 1962, Anna joined the army's Maratha regiment as a driver in 1963, after the government's appeal to the youth to join the army

 1965 ke yuddh main maut se saakshaatkaar ke baad nai dilli railway stesan par unhone swami vivekanand kii ek pustak 'kol tu di youth for nesan' kharidi
 After reading this, his desire to dedicate his life to society also became strong
 unhone mahatma gandhi or vinoba bhaave kii pustaken bhi padhin
 In 1970, he resolved to dedicate himself fully to social work by remaining unmarried for a lifetime
 mumbai padasthaapan ke dauraan vah apane gaanv ralegan aate-jate rahe
 He used to sit there on the rock and thought of improving the village
 1978 main svaichhik seva nivritti lekar ralegan aakar unhone apana saamaajik kaary prarambh kar diya
 There was a severe shortage of electricity and water in this village
 anna ne gaanv waalon ko nahar banane or gadde khodakar barish kaa pani ikattha karne ke liye prerit kiya or swayan bhi isamen yogadan diya
 At the behest of Anna, trees were planted in different places in the village

 These ministers were Shashikant Sutar, Mahadev Shivankar and Baban Gholap
 anna ne un par aay se adhik sampatti rakhane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The government tried hard to persuade him, but eventually he had to remove tainted ministers Shashikant Sutar and Mahadev Shivankar
 gholap ne anna ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar diya
 Anna was unable to produce any evidence in court to support his charge and was jailed for three months
 tatkaaleen mukhyamantri manohar joshi ne unhen ek din kii hiraasat ke baad chhod diya
 An inquiry commission declared Shashikant Sutar and Mahadev Shivankar innocent

 In 1997, Anna Hazare started his campaign from Azad Maidan in Mumbai in support of the Right to Information Act
 9 agast 2003 ko mumbai ke aaazaad maidan main hi anna hajaare aamaran anshan par baith gaye
 Anna Hazare and the Right to Information movement received nationwide support during the 12-day fast-unto-death fast

 See the main article Jan Lokpal Bill Movement jan lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan ke liye jari yah andolan apane akhil bhartiya swaroop main 5 april 2011 ko samajasevi anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ke jantar-mantar par shuru kiye gaye anshan ke saath aarambh hua, jinamein magsese puraskaar vijeta arvind kejariwal, bharat kii pehali mahila prashasnic adhikari kiran bedi, prasiddh lokdharmee vakil prashanth bhushan, aadi shaamil the
 Due to the influence of the means of communication, the impact of this fast spread throughout India and in support of it people started taking to the streets
 inhone bharat sarkaar se ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi lokapal vidheyak banane kii maang kii thi or apni maang ke anuroop sarkaar ko lokapal bill kaa ek masauda bhi diya tha
 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 16 agast ko subah saadhe saat baje jab ve anshan par jane ke liye taiyaari kar rahe the, tab dilli police ne unhen ghar se hi giraftaar kar liya
 Other people on his team were also arrested
 is khabar ne aam janata ko udwelit kar diya or vah sadakon par utarkar sarkaar ke is kadam kaa ahimsaatmak pratirodh karne lagi

 He was sent to Tihar Jail for 7 days judicial custody
 shaam tak deshvyapee pradarshnon kii khabar ne sarkaar ko apana kadam waapas khinchne par majaboor kar diya
 The Delhi Police issued an order to release Anna conditionally
 magar anna anshan jari rakhane par drudh the
 He refused to be released until unconditionally allowed to go on hunger strike
 17 agast tak desh main anna ke samarthan main pradarshan hota rahaa
 Thousands camped outside Tihar Jail in Delhi
 17 agast kii shaam tak dilli police ramlila maidan main 7 dinon tak anshan karne kii ijaajat dene ko taiyaar hui
 But Anna refused permission to fast for less than 30 days
 unhone jail main hi apana anshan jari rakhaa
 Anna got permission for 15 days at Ramlila Maidan and from August 19, Anna Ram was determined to continue his fast for Jan Lokpal Bill at Leela Maidan
 24 agast tak teen muddon par sarkaar se sahmati nahin ban paayi
 Even after 10 days of fasting, the government could not get Anna's fast to end
 Hazare publicly announced three conditions to end his fast from ten days
 unka kahana tha ki tamaam sarkari karmchaariyon ko lokapal ke daayre main laayaa jaae, tamaam sarkari karyaalayon main ek naagarik charter lagaaya jaae or sabhi rajyon main lokayukta ho
 The 74-year-old Hazare said that he will end his fast if Parliament discusses the Jan Lokpal Bill and agrees within the House on these three conditions
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne dono pakshon ke bich jari gatirodh ko todane kii disha main pehali thos pahal karte hue loksabhaa main khuli peshkash kii ki sansad aruna raay or dow jaiprakash narayan sahit anya logon dwaara pesh vidheyakon ke saath jan lokapal vidheyak par bhi vichaar karegi
 The details of the discussion will then be sent to the standing committee
 25 may 2012 ko anna hajaare ne punah jantar mantar par jan lokapal vidheyak or visal blor vidheyak ko lekar ek din kaa sankethik anshan kiya
 Gandhi's legacy is his position
 kad-lathi main vah saadhaaran hi hai
 There is a Gandhi cap on the head and Khadi on the body
 aankhon par motaa chashma he, lekin unako dur tak dikhataa he
 The intentions are Fauladi and Atal
 mahatma gandhi ke baad anna hajaare ne hi bhukh hadtaal or aamaran anshan ko sabase zyada baar bataur hathiyaar istemaal kiya he
 Through this, they have forced the corrupt administration to step down and the governments to enact public beneficial laws
 anna hajaare ko aadhunik yug kaa gandhi bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Anna Hazare is ideal for all of us
 anna hajaare gandhiji ke gram swarajya ko bharat ke gaanvon kii samruddhi kaa madhyam maanate hai
 They believe that 'villages must stand on their feet for a strong India'
 ' unke anusaar vikaas kaa laabh samaan rup se vitarit na ho paane kaa kaaran gaanvon ko kendra main na rakhana rahaa
 From the person building to village building and then naturally he showed Gandhi's mantra of country building into reality and his campaign started from one village to 85 villages successfully today
 vyakti nirmaan ke liye mul mantra dete hue unhone yuvaaon main uttam charitra, shuddh aachaar-vichaar, nishkalank jivan va tyaag kii bhaavana viksit karne va nirbhayata ko aatmsaat kar aam aadmi kii seva ko adarsh ke rup main sweekaar karne kaa aahvaan kiya he
 Michael Faraday was an English physicist and chemist
 unhone vidyut-dhara ke chumbakeey prabhaav kaa avishkaar kiya
 He studied it by electromagnetic induction
 isse dianemon tathaa vidyut motor kaa nirmaan hua
 Later Faraday's law was also included in Maxwell Maxwell's four equations of electromagnetism
 farade ne vidyut rasayan par bhi bahut kaam kiya or isse sambandhit apane do niyam diye
 He invented a diesel-powered power producer, including Rudolf Diesel
 maaikel farade kaa janm 22 sitambar 1791 i
 ko hua
 His father was very poor and used to work as Luhari
 inhone apana jivan landan main jildasaaj kii naukari se prarambh kiya
 He used to read books on chemistry and electrical physics when he got time
 san 1813 i
 main prasiddh rasayanajna, sar hanferi debi, ke vyaakhyaan sunne kaa inhen saubhaahgya praapt hua
 Faraday wrote comments on these lectures and sent them to Debbie
 sar hanferi debi in tippaniyon se bade prabhavit hue or apni anusandhanshala main inhen apana sahyogi bana liya
 Faraday worked diligently and progressed to the Royal Institute of Chemistry in 1833
 apane jeevankaal main farade ne anek khojein kin
 In 1831, he made an important discovery of the principle of electromagnetic induction
 chumbakeey kshetra main ek chaalak ko ghumaakar vidyut-vaahak-bal utpann kiya
 This theory was generated in the future and laid the foundation for modern electrical engineering
 inhone vidyudvishleshan par mahatvapurn kaary kiye tathaa vidyudvishleshan ke niyamon kii sthapana kii, jo farade ke niyam kehalaate hai
 Faraday also named the technical terms used in electronegatology
 chlorine gas kaa draveekaran karne main bhi ye safal hue
 Faraday also contributed in the topics of parabolism, electromagnetism, rotation of line polarized light in magnetic field, etc
 aapane anek pustaken likhin, jinamein sabase upyogi pustak "vidyut main praayogic gaveshanaayen" he
 Faraday continued in his work throughout his life
 ye itane namr the ki inhone koi padavi yaa oopaadhi sweekaar na kii
 Rejected the post of president of Royal Society
 dhun evam lagan se kaary kar, mahaan vaigyanik safalataa praapt karne kaa isse acha udhaaharan vaigyanik itihaas main na milegaa
 Every Free Davy also considered Faraday his greatest discovery
 unhone puure vishwa main sabase pehle motor kii kalpana kii or ek prayog main vidyut se ek chang ko vidyut dhara main utpann chumbakeey kshetra se ghumaya jo ki unki pehali khoj thi
 Michael Faraday died on 25 August 1867 AD
 navada, bihar kaa ek prakhand
 Iliad or Iliad - is the ancient Greek classical epic, which is considered to be the creation of Homer, the ancient poet of Europe
 iskaa namakaran ilian nagar ke yuddh ke varnan ke kaaran hua he
 The overall composition is divided into 24 books and consists of 15,693 lines
 elliod main try rajya ke saath greek longo ke yuddh kaa varnan he
 This epic contains the story of the triumph and destruction of Troy and the heroism of Yunani Veer Ekalis
 sankshep main is mahakavy kii kathavstu is prakaar he : ilian ke raja prium ke putr paris ne sparta ke raja menelouse kii patni param sundari hellen kaa uske pati kii anupasthiti main apharan kar liya tha
 In order to reclaim Helen and punish Eileen, Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon began a campaign against Eileen by gathering forces from all the Greek kings and feudatories
 parantu is abhiyaan ke uparyukt kaaran or uske antim parinaam, arthath ilian ke vidhwans kaa pratyaksh varnan is kavy main nahin he
 It begins with the fury of Eklige, the hero of poetry in the Greek camp
 agamemnan ne suryadev apollo ke pujari kii putree ko balaatkaarpurvak apane paas rakh choda he
 As a result, epidemics spread in the Greek camp
 bhavishyadrashtaa kalks ne batalaaya ki jab tak pujari kii putree ko nahin lautaaya jayega tab tak mahamari nahin rukegi
 Agamemnon presents for this with great difficulty, but in return he snatches a second daughter, Briseis, from the Achilles
 ekilies is apmaan se kshubdh or rusht hokar yuddh main na ladane kii pratigya karata he
 He goes to his tents with his Miramidan army and his friend Patroclus and does not listen to any pleasures
 parinamat: yuddh main agamemnan ke paksh kii kirakiri hone lagati he
 The Greek army escapes and takes refuge in its camp
 paristhitiyon se vivash hokar agamemnan ekilies ke paas apane doot bhejtaa he or uske rosh ke nivaaran ke liye bahut kuch karne ko taiyaar ho jaataa he
 But Eklise's fury does not go away, and he declares to return home the next day
 par vastav main vah agamemnan kii sena kii durdasha dekhne ke liye tehra rahata he
 But his friend Patroclus gets irritated seeing this plight of his side and he gets the command to fight in the war with the Akilis
 ekilies usko apana kavach bhi de detaa he or apane mirmidan sainikon ko bhi uske saath yuddh karne ke liye bhej detaa he
 Patroclus defeats Eilean's army, but in the end he is killed by the Healer of Eilean
 patroklas ke nidhan kaa samachar sunakar ekilies shok or krodh se pagal ho jaataa he or agamemnan se sandhi karke naveen kavach dhaaran kar hektar se apane mitra kaa badla lene yuddh kshetra main pravisht ho jaataa he
 The dice are turned as soon as the war starts from the Echilis
 vah hektar ko maar daalata he or uske pair ko apane rath ke pichley bhaag se baandhakar uske sharir ko yudhakshetra main ghaseetata he jisase uskaa sir ghul main ludhakta chalata he
 After this, the funeral of Patroclass is done with big fat
 ekilies hektar ke shav ko apane shivi main le aata he or nirnay karata he ki uskaa sharir khand-khand karke kutton ko khilaa diya jaae
 Hektar's father, the Eilean king Priam, attends his camp to retrieve his son's body
 uske vilaap se ekilies ko apane pita kaa samaran ho aata he or uskaa krodh dur ho jaataa he or vah karunaa se abhibhoot hokar hektar kaa shav uske pita ko de detaa he or saath hi saath 12 din ke liye yuddh bhi roak diya jaataa he
 Ilayad ends with Hektar's funeral
 kuch hastlikhit pratiyon main eliyad ke ant main ek pankti is aashay kii milti he ki hektar kii antyeshti ke baad amejan naamak nari yoddhaon kii rani panthesilia prium kii sahaayta ke liye ai
 On the basis of this indication, a poet named Quintus of Smyrna wrote a supplementary poem of Iliyad in 14 books
 aadhunik samay main shri arvind ghosh ne bhi apane jivan kii sandhya main maatrik vrutt main ilian naamak eliyad ko purna karanevaali rachana kaa angreji bhashaa main aarambh kiya tha jo puri nahin ho saki
 In the middle of the creation of the ninth book, he attained the achievement of his life
 eliyad main jis yug kii ghatnaon kaa ullekh he usko virayug kehete hai
 The truth of this era was proved to be indisputable after Schleiman and Default excavated the city of Tri
 i
pus
 13veen or 13 shatabdiyaan is yug kaa kaal maani jaati hai
 But the limits of the creation of Iliad were BC There are ninth and seventh centuries
 homer kii rachanaaon se sambandh rakhanevaali samasyaayen atyant jatil hai
 At one time even Homer's existence was beginning to be doubted
 par ab sthiti adhik anukool ho chali he, yadhyapi ab bhi homer ke mahakavy ek vikascram kii charam parinti maane jate hai jinamein ek lokottar pratibha kaa kaushal spasht lakshith hota he
 Iliad has an unprecedented harmony of epic simplicity and kavikarma
 niti kii drushti se asaadhaaran kaam or krodh ke vidhwanskaari parinaam kaa pradarshan jaisaa is kavy main hua he vaisaa anyatra mushkil se milegaa
 Among its male characters are Agamemnon, Achilles, Patroclus, Menelaus, Priam, Paris, and Hektor
 stri paatro main hellen, hecuba, andromaco ityadi mahaan hai
 In the war, humans and gods all participate, somewhere humans rise higher than the gods in qualities, and somewhere the gods become visible victims of human weaknesses and become characters of ridicule
 bhartiya mahakavyon ke saath eliyad kii anek baaten mail khaati hai, jinamein hellen kaa apharan or ilian kaa dahan sita-haran or lankadahan se spasht saadrishy rakhte hai
 Probably this is why Megasthenes had the illusion of the existence of Homer's epics in India
 homer ke anuwaad bahut hai parantu uskaa anuwaad, jaisaa prayek ucch koti kii moulik rachana kaa anuwaad hua karata he, ek samasya he
 If the translator looks at simplicity, then he loses Homer's poetry and wants to capture poetry, then simplicity is destroyed
 is mahakavy kaa europe kii har bhashaa main anuwaad hua he
 There have been many translations in both poetry and prose
 kai bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi 'elliod' tathaa 'odissi' donon ke anuwaad hue hai
 There have been more than one translation in Bangla
 prakhyat kavi micel madhusudan dutt dwaara elliod kaa bangla main kiya gaya pehla parantu adhuraa anuwaad 1941 isvi main prakashit hua
 Yogendranath Kavilinod had published the Iliad's pamphlet in 1902-08 and Ghadyanvad in 1911 AD
 kalantar main elliod or odissi ke bangala main or bhi kai anuwaad hue
 Translation has also been done in Tamil

 jyotishshastra main parinaam kii prapti hone kaa samay jaanane ke liye jin vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he unamem se ek vidhi he vinshottaree dasha
 vinshottaree dasha kaa janak maharishi parashar ko mana jaataa he
 The Vinshottari method created by Parashar Muni is based on Chandra Nakshatra
 is vidhi se kii gai bhavishyavaanee kamovesh sateek maani jaati he, isliye jyotishshastri varshon se is vidhi par bharosa karke falkathan karte aa rahe hai
 In South India, astrologers are also using the Ashtotti method in lieu of the quiz, but the quiz method is more popular and accepted

 Mars for Mercury and Cancer for Ascendant
 lagn ke liye naiysargik rup se grah shubh hone ke baavjood yah dhyaan rakhana jaruri hota he ki kundalee main vah grah kitna balavaan he
 If the planet is weak or low then it will not be able to give its auspicious results despite being auspicious
 Center places have been given great importance in astrology
 aamtaur par yah mana jaataa he ki paap grah shani, mangal, surya kshtakaari hote hai parantu yadi yah kendra bhaavon ke swami hon to unki dasha-antardasha main laabh miltaa he
 His condition remains pleasing for the person in every way

 Syedism is the relative principle of understanding, explaining and expressing the qualities of an object under Jain philosophy
 jain matanusaar kisi bhi vastu ke anant gun hote hai
 It is only possible for a seeker who is free or Kaivalya to know the eternal qualities
 saadhaaran manushyon kaa gyaan aanshik or saapeksh hota he
 This partial knowledge of the object is called new in Jain philosophy
 nay kisi bhi vastu ko samajhane ke vibhinn drushtikon hai
 These are called partial forms of new truth
 aanshik or saapeksh gyaan se saapeksh satya kii prapti hi sambhav he, nirpeksh satya kii prapti nahin
 Due to the attainment of relative truth, the decision of an ordinary person in relation to anything cannot be true in all respects
 logon ke bich matbhed rahane kaa kaaran yah he ki vah apane vichaaron ko nitant satya maanane lagate hai or duusare ke vichaaron kii upeksha karte hai
 In order to express ideas logically and to show the importance of the relativity of knowledge, Jain philosophy has proposed the principle of Syedvad or Saptabhangi Nay
 saapekshik gyaan kaa bodh karaane ke liye jain darshan main prayek nay ke aarambh main syat shavd ke prayog kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he
 It should be noted here that 'syat' does not mean 'perhaps'
 jainiyon ne iskaa udhaaharan ek hathi or chah netraheen vyaktiyon ke madhyam se diya he
 All blind provide a sense of the availability of knowledge and the extent of access to it
 yadi koi hathi ko simit anubhav ke aadhaar par kahe ki hathi khambhe, rassi, diwaar, ajgar yaa pankhe jaisaa bataaye to vah uske aanshik gyaan or saapeksh satya ko hi vyakt karata he
 If the word 'syat' is added to this experience, the vote is considered flawless
 arthath, yadi kaha jaay ki- 'syat hathi khambhe yaa rassi ke samaan he' to mat taarkik rup se sahi mana jaayga
 There are seven types of judgments or judgments in Jain philosophy based on the rationality of relative knowledge
 jain darshan dwaara anubhavik nirnay yaa mat ke is vargeekaran ko hi saptabhangi nay kaha jaataa he
 This is the first opinion
 udhaaharan ke taur par yadi kaha jaay ki 'syat hathi khambhe jaisaa he' to uskaa arth hoga ki kisi vishesh desh, kaal or paristhiti main hathi khambhe jaisaa he
 This opinion is emotional
 yah sahi baat he
 There is no doubt about it
 yah ek abhavatmak mat he
 In this perspective, there should be a view of elephants in such a way that a black elephant is not inside this room
 iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kamare main koi hathi nahin he
 The word Syatam makes sense of the fact that elephant of particular form, color, shape and type is not within this room
 jiske bodh main hathi diwaar yaa rassi kii tarah he uske liye abhavatmak mat ke rup main is nay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he

 Madhavrao Sadashivrao Golwalkar anecdote Shri Guruji was the second Sarsanghchalak and great thinker of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 unhen jansadharan praaia: 'guruuji' ke hi naam se adhik jaanate hai
 He was born on Ekadashi Samvat 1963 of Falgun month accordingly on 19 February 1906 in Ramtek, Maharashtra
 ve apane mata-pita kii chauthi santan the
 His father's name was Shri Sadashiv Rao Aakhyakya 'bhau Ji' and his mother's Mrs Laxmibai Aakhyak 'tai'
 unka bachapan main naam madhav rakhaa gaya par parivaar main ve madhu ke naam se hi pukaare jate the
 Father Sadashiv Rao was initially working in the post and telegraph department, but later in 1908 he was appointed to the post of teacher in the education department
 madhu jab maatr do varsh ke the tabhi se unki shiksha prarambh ho gayi thi
 Whatever Father Pithary Bhauji taught him, he instinctively memorized it
 balak madhu main kushagra budhdi, gyaan kii laalasaa, asaamaanya samaran shakti jaise gunon kaa samucchy bachapan se hi viksit ho rahaa tha
 In 1919, he received a scholarship by showing special merit in the 'high School Entrance Examination'
 san 1922 main 16 varsh kii aayu main madhav ne metric kii pariksha chaanda ke 'jubilee hai skool' se uteern kii
 Thereafter, in 1924, he passed the intermediate examination in science subject with special qualification from 'hislap College' run by Christian Missionaries of Nagpur
 angreji vishay main unhen pratham paritoshik mila
 He used to play a lot of hockey, sometimes even played tennis
 iske atirikt vyaayaam kaa bhi unhen shauk tha
 He was very proficient in the tricks, grip and jump etc
 of Malkhamb
 vidhyaarthee jivan main hi unhone baansuri evam sitar vaadan main bhi acchhee praveenta hasil kar lee thi
 After passing the intermediate examination, a new far-reaching chapter in Madhavrao's life began in 1924 with admission to the Banaras Hindu University
 san 1926 main unhone bi
essi
 or san 1928 main em
essi
 kii parikshaayen bhi praani-shaastra vishay main pratham shrenee ke saath uteern kin
 In this way his student life was very famous
 vishvavidhyalay main bitaaye chaar varshon ke kalkhand main unhone vishay ke adhyayan ke alaava "sanskrit mahakavyon, paashchaatya darshan, shri ramakrishna paramhans, swami vivekananda kii ospurn evam prerak 'vichaar smapda', bhinn-bhinn upasna-panthon ke pramukh granthon tathaa shastreey vishyon ke anek granthon kaa asthaapurvak pathan kiya"
 Meanwhile, his interest in spiritual life was awakened
 em
essi
 kii pariksha uteern karne ke pashchaat ve praani-shaastra vishay main 'matsay jivan' par shodh kaary hetu madras ke matsyalay se jud gayi
 Within a year his father Shri Bhauji retired, due to which he was unable to send money to Shri Guruji
 isi madras-pravaas ke dauraan ve gambheer rup se biimaar pad gayi
 The doctor was of the opinion that if caution is not taken, the disease can take serious form
 do maah ke ilaaj ke baad ve rogamukt to hue parantu unka swasthya purnroopen se purvawat nahin rahaa
 During his stay in Madras, when he was working in research, once the Nizam of Hyderabad came to see the mermaid
 niyamanusaar pravesh-shulk diye bina use pravesh dene se shri guruuji ne inkaar kar diya
 Due to financial constraints Mr
 Guruji had to leave his research work incomplete and return to Nagpur in April 1929
 uname adbhut kshamta thi logo ko apni ore aakarshith karne kii
 Even after coming to Nagpur, he was not well
 iske saath hi unke parivaar kii aarthik sthiti bhi atyant kharaab ho gayi thi
 Meanwhile, he received a proposal from Banaras Hindu University to serve in the post of illustrator
 16 agast san 1931 ko shri guruuji ne banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke praani-shaastra vibhaag main nidarshak kaa pad sambhaal liya
 As it was a temporary appointment
 is kaaran ve praaia: chintit bhi rahaa karte the
 Even in his student life, Madhav Rao used to guide his friends in their studies and now teaching had become a means of livelihood
 unke adhyaapan kaa vishay yadhyapi praani-vigyaan tha, vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne unki pratibha pahchaan kar unhen bi
e
 kii kaksha ke chaatro ko angreji or raajnneeti shaastra bhi padhaane kaa avasar diya
 As a teacher, Madhav Rao became so popular among the students with his unique talent and ability that his students started addressing him in the name of Guruji
 isi naam se ve aage chalakar jivan bhar jane gayi
 Although Madhav Rao was a Masters of Science, he was always ready to teach other subjects like English, Economics, Mathematics and Philosophy to his students and friends when needed
 yadi unhen pustkaalay main pustaken nahin milti thim, to ve unhen kharid kar or padhakar jigyaasi chaatro evam mitron kii sahaayta karte rahete the
 Much of his salary was spent on paying the fees of his promising student-friends or buying his books
 sabase pehle ""dow headgavar"" ke dwaara kaashi vishvavidhyalay bheje gaye nagpur ke swayamsevak bhaiyaji daani ke dwaara shri guruuji sangh ke sampark main aaye or us shakha ke sanghachaalak bhi bane
 In 1937, he returned to Nagpur
 nagpur main shri guruuji ke jivan main ek dam nae mode kaa armbh ho gaya
 In the context of "dr
 Hedgewar", he saw an extremely inspiring nation devoted to him
 kisi aapt vyakti ke dwaara is vishay par poochne par unhone kaha-"meraa rujhaan raashtra sanghathan kaary kii or prarambh se he
 It is my belief that i will be able to do this work with more efficacy by staying in the Union
 isliye maine sangh kaary main hi swayan ko samarpit kar diya
 i feel that my behavior is absolutely consistent with Swami Vivekananda's philosophy and methodology
 "1938 ke pashchaat sangh kaary ko hi unhone apana jivan kaary maan liya
 Constantly with Dr
 Hedgewar, he concentrated all his attention on union work
 isse dow headgavar ji kaa dhyey purna hua
 In 1939, Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar was appointed as the Sarkaryavah of the Sangh due to total dedication and strong self-restraint towards "dr
 Hedgewar", the founder of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 1940 main ""headgavar"" kaa fever badhata hi gaya or apana ant samay jaanakar unhone upasthit kaaryakartaaon ke saamne madhav ko apane paas bulaayaa or kaha ""ab aap hi sangh kaa kaary sambhaalein""
 On 21 June 1940 Hedgewar merged into Anant
 9 agast 1942 ko bina shakti ke hi congress ne angrejon ke khilaaf ""bharat chodo"" andolan ched diya
 a big movement started all over the country, but due to unorganized direction, many types of sabotage started happening on behalf of the people
 sattadhariyon ne badi krurta se daman nitiyaan apanaai
 By 2-3 months, the spark of movement subsided
 desh ke sabhi netaa karagaar main the or unki rihaai kii koi aashaa dikhaai nahin de rahi thi
 Shri Guruji had decided that the Sangh would not directly participate in the movement, but the volunteers would be motivated individually
 16 agast 1946 ko mohammad ali jinnah ne sidhi kaarywahi kaa din ghoshit kar ke hindu hatya kaa tandav machaa diya
 In those days, Shri Guruji, in each of his speeches across the country, kept on calling on the people to stand up against the partition of the country, but the Congress leaders were not in a mood to fight for Akhand Bharat
 pandit nehru ne bhi spasht shabdon main vibhaajan ko sweekaar kar liya tha or 3 june 1947 ko isaki ghoshnaa kar di gai
 The situation of the country suddenly changed
 is kathin samay main swayamsevakon ne pakistan vaale bhaag se hinduon ko surakshit bharat bhejnaa shuru kiya
 The order of the Sangh was that till the last Hindu is safe, it has to stand
 bheeshan dinon main swayamsevakon kaa athulaneey parakram, rankushalta, tyaag or balidaan kii gaatha bharat ke itihaas main svarnim aksharon se likhane laayak he
 Shri Guruji also continued to migrate to Pakistan in this difficult watch
 30 janvari 1948 ko gandhi hatya ke aarope main 4 farvari ko sangh par pratibandh lagaaya gaya
 Mr
 Guruji was arrested
 desh bhar main swayamsevako kii giraftaaryaan hui
 While in jail, he sent a detailed statement of letters and magazines, in which the government was given a befitting reply
 aahvaan kiya gaya kii sangh par aarope siddh karo yaa pratibandh hataao
 This tone was echoed across the country
 26 farvari 1948 ko desh ke pradhanmantri pandit jawaharlal nehru ko grih mantri vallabh bhai patel ne apane patr main likhaa tha ""gandhi hatya ke kand main maine swayan apana dhyaan lagaakar puri jaankaree praapt kii he
 All the criminals associated with him have been caught
 unamem ek bhi vyakti rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa nahin he
 "" 9 disambar 1948 ko satyagrah naam ke is andolan kii shuruyaat hote hi kuch 4-5 hazaar bacchon kaa yah andolan he aisa maanakar netagan ne iskaa majaak udaaya
 But in contrast, no Congress movement had such a number
 77090 swayamsevakon ne vibhinn jelon ko bhar diya
 Eventually, the ban was lifted by ordering the Union to make a written constitution, and now Gandhi's murder was not even mentioned in it
 tab sardaar vallabhbhai patel ne guruuji ko bheje huve apane sandesh main likhaa kii ""sangh par se paabandi uthaane par mujhe jitani kushi hui iskaa pramaan to us samay jo log mere nikat the ve hi bataa sakate hai


 main aapako apni shubhakamanaayen bhejtaa hoon
 "" shri guruuji ne chini akraman shuru hote hi jo maarg darshan diya uske pariprekshya main swayamsevak yuddh prayatnon main janata kaa samarthan jutaney tathaa unka manobal drudh karne main jute gaye
 The importance of their timely cooperation also had to be acknowledged by Pandit Nehru and he even sent an invitation to the RSS volunteers to participate in the Republic Day movement in 1963, despite the objections of some Congressmen
 kahana na hoga kii sangh ke teen hazaar ganaveshadhari swayamsevakon kaa ghosh kii taal par kadam milakar chalanaa us din ke kaarykram kaa ek pramukh aakarshan tha

 There are seven types of logic gates in digital electronics, one of them is a Nand Gate
 nand get ek distal tark dwaar he jiske do yaa adhik input or ek output hote he
 Its behavior is completely opposite to the end gate
 jab iske saare input ko logic haai diya jaay tab iskaa output logic lo hota he or anya sangyojan main iskaa output logic haai hota he
 Due to its features, it is also called universal logic gate, so that other logic gates can be constructed very easily
 iske input a or b he to output Y=A
B hota he
 If there is more than two inputs, its output is y = ABC xxrep 6 
 is get kaa vyavhaar truth teble main dikhya gaya he jisame do input or ek output he
 In electronics, logic high means +5 volts and logic low means 0 volts
 digital electronics main nand get bahut mahatvpurn he kyonki kisi bhi bulian function ko kuch nand get ke sangyojan se karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 This property is called functional perfection
