 Educated women can become good mothers
 mahilaon kii shiksha se dahej samasya, berojgaare kii samasya, aadi saamaajik shanti se jude maamalon ko aasaani se hal kiya ja saktaa he
 This utterance is famous in Sanskrit- 'nasti vidyasam chakshurnasti matri samoguru:'
 This means that this world does not have the same field of learning and does not have the same guru as mother
 ’ yah baat puri tarah sach he
 The first and most impact on the child's development is that of his mother
 mata hi apane bachche ko paath padhaati he
 This initial knowledge of the child becomes a permanent basis of life, like the indelible streak on the stone
 lekin aaj puure bharatvarsh main itane asaamaajik tatv ubhar aae hai, jinhone maa-bahanon kaa rishta khatm kar diya he or jo bhoga-vilaas kii jindagi jeena adhik upyogi samajhane lage hai
 This is the reason why mothers and sisters from towns to cities are insecure
 asuraksha ke kaaran hi balaatkaar or samuhik balaatkaar jaisi anek ghatnaon ke jaal main fasakar mahilaon kaa jivan nark ban chukaa he
 In fact, it is said that the education of women is no less important than the education of any man
 samaaj kii nai ruparekha taiyaar karne main mahilaon kii shiksha purushon se sau guna adhik upyogi he
 Therefore, the government should strive for women's education
 tabhi atyaachaar jaisi ghatnaon par kaabo paaya ja saktaa he
 Being financially self-reliant after receiving education does not mean that a woman should become educated and take a front in front of her, considering the male as her rival
 balki vah aarthik kshetra main bhi purush ke baraabar samanta kaa adhikaar praapt karke uske saath maitrapurna sambandh ke samikarn banane main sakasham bane
 Just as the body requires food, education is necessary for mental development
 agar nari hi shikshit nahin hogi to vah na to safal gruhinee ban sakegi or na kushal mata
 The reason for the rise of child crime in the society is not the mental development of the child
 agar ek maan hi ashikshit hogi to vah apane bacchon kaa sahi maargdarshan karke unka maansik vikaas kaise kar paaegi or ek swasth samaaj kaa nirmaan evam vikaas sambhav nahin ho sakegaa
 Therefore, it can be said that in the future only educated women can come out of the darkness of despair and exploitation and show the right path to the family
 iskaa ek rup shiksha main striyon ko purushon kii hi tarah shaamil karne se sambandhit he
 In another way it refers to the special education system made for women
 bharat main madhya or punarjagran kaal ke dauraan striyon ko purushon se alag tarah kii shiksha dene kii dharna viksit hui thi

 Its story is based on the 1998 film a Perfect Murder
 humaraaz ko 5 july 2002 ko cinemagharon main pradarshit kiya gaya tha
 The film did well at the box office and was declared an average

 The music of the film composed by Himesh Reshammiya was also popular
 karan or priya ek nrity mandali kii mukhya jodi hai, or ek duusare se pyaar karte hai
 Once they perform on a cruise ship of a rich businessman named Raj
 raaj, jise nahin pataa ki priya or karan pyaar main hai, priya ko pehali baar dekhte hi uski ore aakarshith hota he
 a few days later he proposes marriage to Priya, which she accepts
 jab yah baat karan ko pataa chalati he, to vah priya kii sahaayta se raaj ko dhokhaa dekar uskaa sara paisa hadapney kii yojana banataa he
 According to the plan, Priya will divorce Raj after a few years of marriage, and Karan and Priya will happily spend the rest of their lives together from the subsistence fund
 raaj priya ko apane parivaar waalon se milwataa he, jiske baad donon kii shaadi ho jaati he
 a few days later Priya is injured in an accident, and Raj looks after her day and night
 is ghatana se priya kaa hriday parivartan ho jaataa he, or vah raaj ko dhokhaa dene main karan kii sahaayta karne se manaa kar detii he
 Karan immediately changes the plan, and makes an anonymous call to Raj and tells him about Priya's relationship
 raaj yah sunakar chakit rah jaataa he, or aavesh main aakar karan se miltaa he, or use priya ko maarane kii supaari detaa he
 On the other hand, Priya decides to tell Raj the whole truth, and records everything in a cassette and puts it in Raj's car
 usee din yojananusaar karan raaj ke ghar main ghusata he, or priya par hamalaa kar detaa he
 Hearing Priya's recording, Raj realizes his mistake, and he rushes to save Priya and reaches her home, where she learns that Priya is safe, and no one but her is Karan
 karan ne raaj kii sari baaten record kar lee thi, jinke aadhaar par vah use blackmel karne lagata he, or raaj kaa peechha chhodane ke badale maang karata he ki vah priya ko talaak de de
 Karan also reaches Raj's ancestral home, and threatens to tell Raj's family everything
 ant main, raaj ek nishchit sthaan par karan se milane jaataa he, jahaan un donon main hathapayee ho jaati he, or kuch der main priya bhi vahaan pahunch jaati he, jo karan kii hatya kar detii he
 Priya and Raj get back together

 Galta Ji Lake The basic principles of the survey are very simple
 prithvi kii sataha par badi saralata se do aise bindu chune ja sakate hai jo ek duusare kii sthiti se dekhen ja saken or unke bich kii duuri naapi ja sake
 They can be placed on any desired scale on paper in such a way that the survey of their immediate area can be covered on paper
 iske baad in do binduon se kisi bhi tisare bindu kii duuri naapakar usee paimaane se kaagaj par uski saapeksh sthiti ankit kar sakate hai
 In this way, a map of the entire area can be made by taking the distance from any two points to a third unknown point and marking it sequentially
 duusare shabdon main, surveykshan kii vidhi tribhuj kii rachana he
 Above, only one composition of the triangle is mentioned, in which the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are known
 tribhuj kii anya rachana vidhiyaan bhi surveykshan main prayukt hoti hai
 It is very important to find two points for the survey, so that it can be possible to find out the relative position of the third point
 isse yah bhi spasht hota he ki aise surveykshan main binduon kii saapeksh sthitiyaan sahi hone par, unki dishaao kaa gyaan nahin ho saktaa
 Whatever may happen will be limited only to the accuracy of the magnetic compass
 isse yah kathinaayee hogi ki vistrut kshetra main yadi kinhin bhinn-bhinn do yaa adhik sthalon se, swatantra rup se do do bindu lekar surveykshan aarambh kiye jaaen, to unka ubhaynishth rekha par thik milan hoga avashyambhavi nahin he
 Because the initial basis of such surveys has no definite facility and principle of keeping the same directions of the articles
 is anischitata ko dur karne ke liye, surveykshan hetu sampurna vistrut pradesh main vyavasthit or yojit rup se pramukh bindu chunakar unamem ek mulbindu maan lete hai
 Then, respectively, the distances from other points of the origin and the angle from the north direction are determined and from these components the surveyor draws the coordinates of those points
 surveykshan kriya kii safalataa ke liye surveykshak ke liye nimnlikhit teen samasyaon kaa hal nikaalnaa aavashyak hota he : The first problem was solved by the surveyor taking advantage of the magnet's dipping properties, which are universally known, and inventing the theodolite
 duusari samasya kaa hal feeta, jareeb aadi kai prakaar ke upkarnon ke prayog se kiya, jo sarsaadhaaran ko vidit hai
 The solution of these two problems in the regions of flat or almost flat areas gave rise to a survey method, from which the coordinates of the chosen points can be extracted
 is vidhi ko theodolite sankraman, yaa keval chankraman, kehete hai
 But where the ground is broken or low, at which the straight distance between the selected point points cannot be measured with ribbon, then the method of traversal will not be successful
 aisi dasha main surveykshak tribhujan kii vidhi apanaataa he
 The feature of this method is that the surveyor can find the distance between points using mathematical formulas
 at: surveykshak unche neeche parvatiy pradesh main lambii-lambii duuri tak drushtigochar pramukh binduon ko is prakaar chunata he ki ve tribhujon kii sugathit jaali ke sheersh bindu ban jaaen
 In such a triangle, all the three angles of each triangle are measured with a theodolite
 unamem se ek tribhuj aisa banaaya jaataa he jisaki ek bhujaa bhoomi par sahi sahi naap lee jaati he
 The azimuth is also known at the point of one end of that arm
 taduparant upyukt trikoshmetiya sutara se anya tribhujon kii sari bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan nikaali ja sakati he isi prakaar krmanugat sabhi tribhuj hal ho jate hai, phir a yaa a ke nirdeshaankon ke gyaat hone se, aage ke binduon kii duuri or digansh se nirdeshaank nikaal liye jate hai
 This type of triangulation is spread over the entire region
 bhujaaon kii lambaai 10 se 50 mile tak hoti he or nirdeshaankon kii gananaa prithvi kii vakrata kaa dhyaan rakhkar kii jaati he
 This type of survey comes under Geological Survey
 iske baad aise pradesh ke chote-chote bhubhaagon kaa patt surveykshan karne ke liye bhuganitiya surveykshan se sthapit niyantran bindu kaam main aate hai
 If the control points obtained from a geometric survey are not sufficient for a platen survey, the surveyor performs a small triangulation based on the geometric control points to meet the local requirement, yielding sufficient control points
 aise bindu paakar surveykshak ek vargankit kaagaj par unka aalekh banaata he
 Thus with the help of regulators all the points settle into their correct relative positions
 in binduon se maanchitr par dikhaae janevaale anya binduon kii dishaao or dooriyaan ko naapakar surveykshak unhen maanchitr par darshata he
 This description will lead to a correct assumption that in this type of survey, a lot of time will be lost
 is durbalata par vijay paane ke liye surveykshak patalvitran kii prakriya apanaataa he
 In graphing, the surveyor seizes the article made of control points on a square letter, fixed on a flat wooden board
 aisa patal ek tipai par pench dwaara aise kas diya jaataa he ki aavashyaktaa hone par patal pench kii sthiti par ghumaya ja sake or manachaahi avasthaa main ksaa ja sake
 Another tool is used with such a board, called a stove
 60 yaa 75 centimetre lambii, ek centimetre moti or paanch centimetre chaudee, dhaatu yaa lakdi kii pattee kii darsharekhni bani hoti hai
 The long two sides are very straight and one side sloping, so that the straight and right line can be drawn
 rekha khinchne kinare kaagaj par rahete hai
 On the upper floor, two visible altars stand vertically
 surveykshak aalekhmandit patal ko aalekh par ankit kisi ek bindu kii bhaumik sthiti par rakhata he
 Subsequently, the viewpoint is tangential to one point above the edge and visible to another face point
 tab vah darsharekhni ko bina hilaae, drishy vedhikaon se dekhte hue, patal ko aise ghumaakar sthir karata he jisase donon sparshi binduon ko milaanevaali bhaumik rekha patal par ankit unki sthitiyon ko milaanevaali rekha ke samaantar ho jaae
 In this case, the line connecting any two face points on the square on the board will be parallel to the physical line
 duusare shabdon main patal aalekh sahi dishaao main sthir ho gaya
 The surveyor then progressively draws directions from its position on the graph, looking at the other points on the map from the viewpoint
 taduparant vah aalekh par gyaat kisi duusari bhaumik sthiti par khadaa hokar, patal ko pehle kii bhanti hi sahi dishaao main sthir karata he
 This process is called placement of the board
 pun: unheen binduon kii disharekhaayen, jinhen kiran kehete hai, khinchi jaati hai
 These rays establish the correct relative positions of those points on the graph, giving their first consistency rays the intersection points
 isi prakaar saare kshetra kaa surveykshan ho jaataa he
 The surveyor draws the points, makes natural and artificial objects on the surface of the earth from them on the graph by signs
 is kriya ko patalchitran kehete hai
 Many copies can be made by printing the map obtained from the paleography
 ek hi aalekh par kai maheenon tak surveykshak kaam karata he, jisase surveykshan hetu sampurna kshetra kaa maanchitr ban sake
 This causes the screen painting to become somewhat dirty and unsightly
 saaf or sundar maanchitr praapt karne kii drushti se surveykshak apane patalchitr kii, nile rang main apekshit maanchitr se, dyodhe paimaane par pratilipi taiyaar karata he
 Draws clean and beautiful objects on it again and subtracts from photography to get the correct scale map
 san 1914 ke mahayuddh ne surveykshan kii ek nai vidhi ko janm diya he
 Under this method, a series of photographs are taken from the aircraft for survey
 photo lete samay camera kaa aksh ekadam urdhwadhar rahata he
 For this reason, the type of photo we take is called vertical photograph
 photo lete samay yah dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki prayek krmanugat photograph main unase sannikat peeche ke photograph kaa 60 bhaag ubhaynishth ho or sannikat daayen or baayein photographon main 25 ke lagbhag bhaag ubhaynishth ho
 At the time of depiction, conical light rays from the surface of the Earth pass through the lens of the camera onto the photo plate, creating reflections
 is par vichaar karne se spasht ho jayega ki Points, raised above or below the plane surface, are depicted by the correct vertical projection positions formed on the map, binduon kii jitani hi adhik oonchaai yaa gaharaai hogi unka hataav bhi utana hi adhik hoga, This deletion is the primary or reflex of the center of the photo
 at: prithvi kii sataha par kinhin bhi do binduon dwaara photo centre kii bhaumik sthiti par bana kone photo ke sangati kone ke baraabar hoga, Overlapping 60 ऽ parts of the front and back photos on each photo will also have their central points painted on the middle photo
 in kendriya binduon ko pradhan bindu yaa mukhya aadhaar bindu or photo par unhen jodanevaali rekha ko aadhaar kehete hai
 By taking advantage of these geometric relationships on the photo, the surveyor is able to map them
 vah pehle us kshetra main sthit niyantran binduon ko photo par pahachaanakar chihnit karata he
 Then from the photo, along with the control points and key points, create a graph paper in which all the points are sitting in their right relative positions on the desired scale
 aisa aalekhptr vah paardarshee kaagaj par banaata he
 He then places each photo respectively below its main point on the article in such a way that the adjacent bases on the article coincide with the musical bases on the photo
 is prakaar kaa diksthaapan hone par, surveykshak maanchitr main darshane yogya, us amuk photo main chitrit, binduon ko pradhan bindu se kirane khinch detaa he
 By doing the same action on all the front and back photos, the percussion of a few point rays, the correct relative positions of the points are obtained, with the help of which the map is prepared like a panorama
 is kriya ko hawaii surveykshan kehete hai
 If aerial photographs are taken by keeping the axis of the camera tilted from the vertical direction, the surveyor can still draw maps from them

 The first blast furnace in Russia was opened near Tula in 1637 and was called the Gorodish Works
 yahan se blast fernes kaa prasar madhya rus main or uske baad ant main uralls tak hua
 Blast furnaces built in medieval West Africa have also been discovered and recorded, along with some metalworking Bantu civilizations such as the Bunyoro Empire and the Nyoro people
 1709 main england ke shropashire ke colbrukdel main abraham darbi ne blast fernes main eendhan ke rup main charcol ke bajaay coke kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kiya
 Coke iron was initially used for casting, making utensils and other cast iron items

 The raw material is transported over the blast furnace via a skip car driven by pulleys or carrier belts
 blast fernes main kachche maal ko charge karne ke liye kai tarah ke tareekon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Some blast furnaces use a "double bell" system where two "bells" are used to control the entry of raw materials into the blast furnace
 in donon belon kaa uddeshy blast fernes main garm gaison ke nuksaan ko kam karnaa he
 The raw material is first emptied into the upper or smaller bell
 uske baad adhik sahi dhang se charge kaa vitaran karne ke liye bel ko ek purv nirdhaarit pariman main ghumaya jaataa he
 The smaller bell is then opened to empty the charge in the larger bell
 uske baad blast fernes ko band karne ke liye chote bel ko band kar diya jaataa he jabaki bada bel blast fernes main charge ko vitarit karata he
 a more recent design uses a "bellless" system
 in pranaaliyon main prayek kachche maal ke liye ekaadhik hoparon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jise tab valve ke madhyam se blast fernes main mukt kar diya jaataa he
 These valves prove to be more accurate than skip or carrier systems in controlling the magnitude of each component to be added, which increases the efficiency of the furnace
 inamen se kuch bel rahit pranaaliyon main charge ko sthapit karne ke sthaan ko thik se niyantrit karne ke liye shoot kaa istemaal bhi kiya jaataa he
 The iron-making blast furnace itself is made of a long chimney-like structure with refractory bricks
 coke, chuunaapatthar flux or louh ayask ko ek sateek bharan kram main fernes ke upree bhaag main charge kiya jaataa he jisase bhatti ke bheetar gas ke pravaah or rasinic pratikriya ko niyantrit karne main madad milti he
 Four "detectors" help the hot and dirty gas to come out of the furnace's dome while the "bleeder valve" protects the upper part of the furnace from a sudden increase in gas pressure
 plag-in kar dene ke baad bleader vaalvon ko ek bleader clinar se saafe karnaa padataa he
 The coarse angles present in the gas get trapped in the "dust catcher" and put into a railroad car or truck to expel them while the gas itself is passed through a venturi scrubber and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the clean gas
 Passes
 bhatti ke nichle aadhe bhaag ke "castahouse" main basal pipe, tour or taral lohe or dhaatumal kii dhalaai kaa upkaran hota he
 After opening the "tap hole" through a refractory clay plug, the liquid iron and clinker are released into a trough through a "skimmer" opening separating the iron and clinker
 aadhunik or badi blast bhattiyon main adhik se adhik chaar nalchhidr or do castahouse ho sakate hai
 After cast iron and sludge are released through the tap, the tap hole is again sealed with refractory soil
 tour kaa istemaal hot blast ko karyanvit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he jiskaa istemaal blast bhatti kii kaarykushalta ko badhaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The hot blast is transported to the furnace by means of copper bins cooled with water, named Tuer, near the base
 stove kii dizin or sthiti ke aadhaar par garm blast kaa taapmaana 900 degree celsius se 1300 degree celsius tak ho saktaa he
 Their temperature tolerance can range from 2000 ° c to 2300 ° C
 utpaadakta main vruddhi karne ke liye aavashyak atirikt urja mukt karne ke liye tour str par bhatti main coke ke saath tel, alkatraa, prakritik gas, powderyukt koyala or oxigen daalaa ja saktaa he
 The main chemical reaction that produces molten iron is as follows: is pratikriya ko ekaadhik charnon main baanta ja saktaa he jinamein se pehle charan ke rup main bhatti main pravaahit pehle se garm blast hawa coke ke rup main carbon ke saath pratikriya karti he jiske parinamswaroop carbon mono oxide or garmi kaa utpaadan hota he: Warm carbon mono oxide is the reducing factor of iron ore and it reacts with iron oxide to form molten iron and carbon dioxide
 bhatti ke vibhinn bhaagon ke taapmaana ke aadhaar par lohe ko kai charnon main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 At the top of the furnace where temperatures are typically between 200 ° c and 700 ° C, iron oxide is converted to ferrous iron oxide, fe3o4
 lagbhag 850 degree celsius taapmaana par bhatti main thodaa or neeche kii tarah aayran aayran ko aayran oxide main badal diya jaataa he: As a fresh food material, the nitrogen in the air passing through the furnace, heated carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide with trespass enters the reaction zone
 jab ye gaisen neeche kii taraf jaati hai to pratikul-vartmaan gaisen feed charge ko garm karne ke saath-saath chuunaapatthar ko calcium oxide or carbon daai oxai main badal detii hai: When iron oxide enters an area with a high temperature up to 1200 ° C, it subsequently turns into an iron metal: is prakriya main nirmit carbon daai oxide coke kii sahaayta se phir se carbon mono oxide main parinat ho jaataa he
 The main reaction that controls the furnace's gaseous atmosphere is called the boudoir reaction: bhatti ke madhya kshetron main chuunaa pathar ke apghaton kii prakriya nimnlikhit pratikriya ke anusaar aage badhati he: Calcium oxide produced by decomposition reacts with various acidic impurities present in iron to form a phylitic clinker which is essentially calcium silicate, casio3: blast fernes dwaara nirmit "pig aayran" main apekshaakrit rup se lagbhag 4 se 5 pratishat carbon saamagree hoti he jisase yah bahut bhangur ban jaataa he or iskaa istemaal simit or tatkaal vanijyik prayojan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Some pig iron is used to make cast iron
 carbon saamagree ko kam karne ke liye or aujaaron or nirmaan samagriyon ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale vibhinn stareey ispaat ke nirmaan karne ke liye blast ferneson dwaara nirmit zyaadaatar pig aayran ko atirikt prakriya se guzarana padataa he
 Although the efficiency of blast furnaces is continuously developing, but still there is no change in the chemical process inside the blast furnace
 american aayran and steel institute ke anusaar: "sahasrabdi tak blast bhattiyon kaa vajood rahegaa kyonki badi or kaarykushal bhattiyon main anya louh nirmaan praudyogikiyon kii tulana main kam kharch par garm dhaatu kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 "one of the biggest drawbacks of blast furnaces is that they essentially produce carbon dioxide because carbon is converted to iron to obtain iron and there is no economical alternative - in the steelmaking world Carbon dioxide is one of the inevitable industrial contributors to emissions
 blast bhatti ke greenhouse gas utsarjan dwaara sthapit chunauti ko uelsioes ek chaalu europea kaaryam main sambodhit kiya ja rahaa he
 Several new process routes have been proposed and closely examined to cut specific emissions by at least 50%
 kuch CO2 ko hasil karne ke baad use bhandaarit karne par jor dete hai jabaki anya hydrogen, bijli or biomas ke jariye lohe or ispaat ke utpaadan ko carbon rahit karne kaa suzav dete hai
 Currently, a technology incorporating CCS in the blast furnace process itself and a top-gas recycling blast furnace is being developed and simultaneously plans to build a blast furnace for commercial purpose

 Dr
 Narendra Kohli is a famous Hindi litterateur
 kohli ji ne sahitya ke sabhi pramukh vidhaon evam gaun vidhaon or aalochanatmak sahitya main apni lekhnee chalaai he
 He has created centuries of great texts
 hindi sahitya main 'mahakavyatmak upanyaas' kii vidha ko prarambh karne kaa shrey narendra kohli ko hi jaataa he
 Kohli's other specialty is solving problems of mythological and historical characters and presenting modern social problems and their solutions to the society through them
 kohliji saanskrithik rashtravaadi sahityakar hai, jinhone apni rachanaaon ke madhyam se bhartiya jivan-style evam darshan kaa samyak parichay karavaaya he
 In January 2017, he was honored with the Padma Shri
 narendra kohli kaa janm 6 janvari 1940 ko sanyukt punjab ke sialkot nagar me hua tha jo ab pakistan me he
 Elementary education started in Lahore and after the partition of India, the family moved to Jamshedpur
 dilachasp he ki praarambhik avasthaa main hindi ke is sarvakalik shreshth rachanaakaar kii shiksha kaa madhyam hindi na hokar urdu tha
 He got the Hindi subject only after the Class x examination
 vidhyaarthee ke rup main narendra atyant medhaavi the evam achche ankon se uteern hote rahe
 vaad-vivaad pratiyogitaaon main bhi unhen anek baar anek pratiyogitaaon main pratham sthaan praapt hua
 Later, he also got a postgraduate and doctorate degree from Delhi University
 prasiddh aalochak dow nagendra ke nirdesan main "hindi upanyaas : srijan evam siddhant" is vishay par unka shodh prabandh purna hua
 It is only in this preliminary work that young Narendra Kohli's penetrating vision and the power to take hold of the basic elements are revealed
 1963 se lekar 1995 tak unhone dilli vishvavidhyalay me adhyaapan kaary kiya or vahiin se 1995 main purnakalik lekhan kii swatantraaa praapt karne ke liye svaichhik avkaash grahan kiya
 Often, after evaluating the literary contribution of Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi after six-seven decades, a major fact can now be added to it
 acharya dvivedi ne hindi sahitya main ek aise dwaar ko kholaa jisase guzar kar narendra kohli ne ek sampoorn yug kii pratishtha kar daali
 yah hindi sahitya ke itihaas kaa sabase ujjwal prishth he or is naveen prabhaat ke pramukh vaitalik hone kaa shri avashya hi acharya dvivedi kaa he jisane yuva narendra kohli ko prabhavit kiya
 One can think from the original point of view on the insistence of clear and well-reasoned argument without being influenced by traditional ideology and characterization
 This is the feature which was laid by Acharya Dwivedi and the Ramkatha, Mahabharata story
 And it is the credit of Acharya Narendra Kohli for erecting grandiose titles of Krishna-stories etc
 sankshep main kaha jaae to bhartiya samskruti ke mul swar acharya dvivedi ke sahitya main pratidhwanit hue or unki anugunj hi narendra kohli rupi paanchajnya main samaa kar samskruti ke krishnodghosh main parivartit hui jisane hindi sahitya ko hilaa kar rakh diya
 In the modern era, Narendra Kohli gave voice to theistic values in literature
 san 1975 main unke ramakatha par aadhaarit upanyaas 'diksha' ke prakaashan se hindi sahitya main 'saanskrithik punarjagran kaa yug' prarambh hua jise hindi sahitya main 'narendra kohli yug' kaa naam dene kaa prastaav bhi jor pakadta ja rahaa he
 In the era of immediate darkness, despair, corruption and pricelessness, Narendra Kohli chose a classics character who was alive in Indian Manisha's romance
 mahakavy kaa zamana biit chukaa tha, sahitya ke 'katha' tatva kaa samvahak ab padya nahin, gadhy ban chukaa tha
 The manner in which young Kohli embodied the much-hyped Ramkatha as a novel on the strength of his classical talent, has now become a golden page in the history of Hindi literature
 yugon yugon ke andhkaar ko chirakar unhone bhagwaan ram kii katha ko bhaktikaal kii bhavukta se nikaal kar aadhunik yatharth kii jameen par khadaa kar diya
 saahitiyik evam pathak varg chamatkrit hi nahin, abhibhoot ho gaya
 How a neglected and exiled prince buries new life in his power of exploited, afflicted and stricken people, it was nothing short of a miracle to be seen in 'abhyudaya'
 yug-ugantar se rudh ho chuki ramakatha jab aadhunik pathak ke ruchi-sanskaar ke anusaar bilkul nae kalevar main dhalakar jab saamne aayi, to yah dekhakar man rize bina nahin rahata ki usamen ramakatha kii garima evam ramayana ke jivan-mulyon kaa lekhak ne samyak nirvaah kiya he
 Not surprisingly, young Narendra Kohli was blessed and praised by all the veteran writers of the time
 Moralist critic and litterateur Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Amritlal Nagar, Yashpal, Jainendrakumar, etc
 Almost all the top creators praised Narendra Kohli with open-hearted words
 Famous creators of the time like Jainendra also read the young Kohli and the words in which he expressed his response made it clear to announce the arrival of a special talent in Hindi literature
 main nahin jaanata ki upanyaas se kya apeksha hoti he or uskaa shilp kya hota he
 It seems that your creation rises higher from the religion of the novel to some class of scripture
 main iske liye aapkaa kritagya hota hoon or aapako hardik badhai detaa hoon
 -jainendra kumaar i have seen in you the talent that brings you among the leading writers of Hindi
 ram katha ke aadi vaale ansh kaa kuch bhaag aapane badi kushalta ke saath prastut kiya he
 He has novelty, the story has a grip
 bhagwaticharan verma, You have tried to give as much realistic rational interpretation to the Ram Katha, which many historians believe to be merely mythological fiction or myth
 ahalya kii myth ko bhi kalpana se yatharth kaa abhas dene kaa acha prayaas
 yashpal You have seen Ram Katha with a completely new vision
 'avasar' main ram ke charitra ko aapane nayi maanviya drushti se chitrit kiya he
 The character of Sita you portrayed in this is very attractive
 sita ko kabhi aise tejodrupt rup main chitrit nahin kiya gaya tha
 Also, you have portrayed the character of Sumitra as a very stunning woman
 mujhe is baat kii prasannataa he ki yatha-sambhav ramayana katha kii mul ghatnaon ko parivartit kiye bina aapane uski ek manograhi vyakhya kii he
 


 the book reveals your study, contemplation and contemplation
 - hajariprasad dvivedi, In the initiation, a bold attempt has been made to provide modern reference to Ramkatha on the basis of adult thinking
 balkand kii pramukh ghatnaon tathaa ram or vishwamitra ke charitron kaa vivek sammat punrakhyaan, ram ke yugapurush / yugavatar rup kii tarkpusht vyakhya upanyaas kii vishesh uplabdhiyaan hai

 If i had been a king or a resourceful minister, i would have bought the same book instead of Ramayana and divided it from house to house

 Many images appear to be good, as well as nibble, but all it takes is a good tableau and the novel picks up again

 amritlal nagar Some first-class novelists now have a name and a name - firmly i want to convey my opinion to you
 


 All the characters related to Ramakatha have come out in new forms, their public-oriented role will sprout in each reader-reader, this is my future statement
 -kavi baba nagarjun Never before had i read such an elaborate interpretation of Ramakatha
 isse ram ko maanviya dharaatal par samajhane kii badi swasth drushti milti he or kori bhavukta ke sthaan par sangharsh kii yatharthata ubhar kar saamne aati he
 

 there is great freshness in your interpretation
 taareef to yah he ki aapane ramakatha kii parmparik garima ko kahin vikrut nahin hone diya he
 


 i would like you to inaugurate the Ramayana and other mythological episodes and characters of the Mahabharata
 If you are attuned to the work of risk, then you will be the pioneer of the new genre in Hindi fiction
 "-shivamangal Singh 'suman' da narendra kohli kaa hindi sahitya main apana vishisht sthaan he
 What he has written in the last thirty-thirty years is like being new as well as breaking a new ground in mythical terms
 


kohli ne vyang, naatak, samiksha or kahani ke kshetra main bhi apni moulik pratibha kaa parichay diya he
 a connoisseur of human compassion, Narendra Kohli is a talented senior litterateur of the present era
 " da vijayendra snaatak', In fact, Narendra Kohli has neither seen his Ramkatha from communal point of view nor from revivalist point of view
 This vision opposing the autocracy of humanist, expansionist monarchy is supportive of progressive humanism
 maanavtaa kii raksha tathaa nyaaypurna samtadhrut shoshanrahit samaaj kii sthapana kaa swapn na to kisi drushti se sampradayik he na hi punarutthanavaadee
 - dow kavita surabhi The contribution of Narendra Kohli is also high enough in quantum magnitude
 unniis upanyaason ko samete unki mahakavyatmak upanyaas shrinkhlaayein 'mahasamar', 'todo, kaara todo', 'abhyuday' hi gunvattta evam maatra donon kii drushti se apane purvavartiyon se kahin adhik hai
 His other novels can also be counted among the masterpieces in various categories
 saamaajik upanyaason main 'saath saha gaya dukh', 'kshamaa karnaa jiji', 'priti-katha'; aitihaasik upanyaason main rajyavardhan evam harshavardhan ke jivan par aadhaarit 'aatmadaan'; darshanik upanyaason main krishna-sudama ke jivan par aadhaarit 'abhigyaan'; puranic-aadhuniktaavaadi upanyaason main 'vasudev' unhen hindi ke samast purvavarti evam samakaleen sahityakaron se ucchtar pad par sthapit kar dete hai
 Apart from this, along with extensive satirical literature, drama and stories, Narendra Kohli has written serious and excellent essays, travel details and poignant criticisms
 sankshep main kaha jaay to unka avdaan gadhy kii har vidha main dekha ja saktaa he, evam vah praayah sabhi anya sahityakaron se unki vishisht vidha main bhi shreshth hai
 Even half of his work is enough to declare any other litterateur as an era-originating litterateur
 narendra kohli ne to un kathaon ko apana madhyam banaaya he jo apane vistaar evam vaividhya ke liye vishwa-vikhyath hai : ramakatha evam mahabharat katha
 While referring to 'yannabharathe - Tannabharathe', the number and variety of characters, events, sentiments etc
 mentioned in his mega ceremony 'mahasamar' will be sufficient
 See the description art, characterization, description of the personage, etc
 Kohli not only surpasses Premchand, but also has more sensitivity and depth
 narendra kohli kii vah visheshta jo unhen in donon purvavartiyon se vishisht banaati he vah he ek ke pashchaat ek pantis varshon tak nirantar unniis kaaljayi kritiyon kaa pranayan sarvshereshth he
 Apart from this, there are also large satirical literature, social novels, historical novels, psychological novels; Successful plays are such a treasure of conceptual essays, critical essays, critical and analytical arrangements, address, articles, memoirs, sketches
 

 gadhy kii prayek vidha main unhone hindi sahitya ko itnaa diya he ki unke samakaksh sabhi avdaan fike jaan padate hai
 Narendra Kohli has shown his ingenuity in all major and secondary genres of prose such as novel, story, satire, drama, essay, criticism, memoir etc
 upanyaas vidha par adbhut pakad hone ke kaa kaaran he narendra kohli kii kai vishyon main vyapak siddhahastata maanav manovigyaan ko vah gaharaai se samajhate hai evam vibhinn charitron ke mul tatv ko pakad kar bhinn-bhinn paristhitiyon main unki sahaj pratikraya ko ve prabhaavshaalee evam vishwasaneey dhang se prastut kar sakate hai
 Average and extraordinary, they not only capture all types of characters with their innate senses and penetrating analytical power, but also identify with them
 rajnatik samikarnon, ghaat-pratighaat, shakti-santulan ityadi kaa vyapak chithran unki rachanaaon main miltaa he
 On the level of language, style, craft and plot, Narendra Kohli has done many new and successful experiments
 upanyaason ko pracheen mahakavyon ke str tak uthaa kar unhone mahakavyatmak upanyaason kii nai vidha kaa avishkaar kiya he
 The best example of Narendra Kohli's perfection is the very brief frontend from the wide spread of his grandeur 'mahasamar' to 'suffered with grief'
 Enriched by hundreds of characters and thousands of events, there is no scattering anywhere in the four-thousand-page spread of the eight volumes of 'mahasamar', neither the discrepancies of the character, nor the difference of vision and philosophy
 How clear is the author's analytical vision in this epic novel written over a period of fifteen years, it can be understood by looking at his book "jahan hai dharma, wahi hai jai" which is based on the Mahabharata's semantics
 is granth main unhone 'mahasamar' main varnit paatro evam ghatnaon par vichaar kiya he, samasyaon ko saamne rakhaa he evam unka nidaan dhundne kaa prayaas kiya he
 This venture of this great philosopher, who tries to understand the Mahabharata, is made in view, in which a complete book is prepared in the graphs of his thought process
 sahitya ke vidhyaarthiyon or aalochakon ke liye narendra kohli kii sahitya-srijan-prakriya ko samajhane main yah granth na sirf mahatvapurn he varan param aavashyak he
 In this book, Narendra Kohli has given new and clear installations about various characters
 unki jan-maanas main ankit chhavi se prabhavit or aatankit hue bagaiyr ghatnaon ke taarkik vishleshan se kohliji ne krishna, yudhisthir, kunti, draupadi, bhishma, dron ityadi ke mul charitra kaa rudhigat chhaviyon se paryaapt bhinn vishleshan kiya he
 His second novel on the second pole is "saath Sahay Grief" which is woven with just two characters
 unke dwaara likhaa gaya praarambhik upanyaas hone ke baavjood yah hindi sahitya kii ek atyant shashakt evam praudh kriti he
 'saath saath grief' reveals Narendra Kohli's literary power
 'sidhi baat' ko sidhe-sidhe spasht rup se aise kah dena ki vah pathak ke man main utar jaae, use hansaa bhi de or rulaa bhi
 is kala main narendra kohli adwitiya hai
 'suffered with grief' reveals the sensitive side of Narendra Kohli
 mahadevi dwaara 'prasad' ke liye kahi gayi ukti unpar bilkul sateek baithti he: "


 se pramanit hota he ki unki jivan-veena ke taar itane sadhe hue the ki halki se halki jhankaar bhi usamen pratidhwani paa leti thi
 " "yah dekh kar mujhe aashcharya hota tha ki maatr dhai paatro kaa sada sapaat gharelu yaa paariwarik upanyaas itnaa gatiman evam aakarshak kaise ban gaya he
 By mixing the beauty of simplicity in the ornate life-language, which art has made it so full of condescending sensibilities
 " Kohli's first novel was 'resurrection'
 In this subjective-social novel, the novelist, with the goal of describing three generations, had tried to portray the mentality of people of different sections of the transitional society of independence and their circumstances of life-struggle through them
 iske pashchaat aayaa 'aatank'
 sad chuke vartmaan samaaj kii niraashajanak sthiti, atyaachaar se ladane kii uski asamarthta, buddhijiviyon kii vichaardhaara kii napunsakata evam ucch vichaardhaara kii karm main parinti kii asafalataa kaa isamen aisa chithran he jo man ko avsaad se bhar detaa he
 One of the great achievements of Narendra Kohli is "meaningful thinking on the current problems by removing them from the lapse of time and flow as the eternal problems of human society"
 The readable and engaging inclusion of philosophy, spirituality and policy in the novel makes him stand on a higher level than all the contemporary and earlier writers
 yon to chah varsh kii aayu se hi unhone likhnaa prarambh kar diya tha lekin 1960 ke baad se unki rachanaayen prakashit hone lageen
 They are different from contemporary writers in that they wrote known stories in a very original way
 aitihaasik kathaon par aadhaarit unke pramukh vrihadaakaar upanyaason kii suchi neeche di gayi he
 His compositions have been translated into various Indian languages
 ‘diksha’, ‘avasar’, ‘sangharsh kii ore’ or ‘yuddh’ naamak ramakatha shrinkhalaa kii kritiyon main kathakaar dwaara sahasrabdiyon kii parampara se janamanas main jame ishwaravatr bhav or bhakthibhaav kii jameen ko, usase judi dharm or ishwarvachi saanskrithik jameen ko todaa gaya he
 The new land of Ramkatha is presented in a new human, credible, physical, social, political and modern form
 narendra kohli ne praayah sau se bhi adhik ucch koti ke granthon kaa srijan kiya he
 Reference book patrikaon ke visheshank Vishnu has been recognized as the supreme power and control of the entire world since Vedic times
 hindu dharm ke aadharbhoot granthon main bahumanya purananusaar vishnu parameshwar ke teen mukhya roopon main se ek rup hai
 In the Puranas, Trimurti Vishnu has been called the follower of the world
 trimurti ke anya do rup brahma or shiv ko mana jaataa he
 While Brahma is considered the creator of the world, Shiva is considered the destroyer
 multah vishnu or shiv tathaa brahma bhi ek hi hai yah manyata bhi bahushah sweekrut rahi he
 Vishnu has been recognized as one who incarnates in various forms to guide justice, destruction of injustice, and guide the organism to follow the path appropriately
 purananusaar vishnu kii patni lakshmi hai
 Kamdev was the son of Vishnu
 vishnu kaa nivas ksheer sagar he
 His sleeping is over Sheshnag
 unki naabhi se camel utpann hota he jisamen brahma ji sthit hai
 He holds the Padma in his lower left hand, the mace in his lower right hand, the conch in the upper left hand and the chakra in his upper right hand
 'vishnu' shabd kii vyutpatti mukhyatah 'vish' dhaatu se hi maani gayi he
 In Nirukta, Yasakacharya has taken the word 'vishnu' in the sense of 'vyapati' and termed it as 'vishnu'
 vaikalpik rup se 'vish' dhaatu ko bhi 'pravesh' ke arth main liya gaya he, 'kyonki vah vibhu hone se sarvatra pravesh kiya hua hota he
 Adi Shankaracharya has also considered the meaning of the word 'vishnu' broadly in his Vishnusahsrnama-bhasya, and has clearly written as its etymology that "vishu, the epithet of vyasth meaning, becomes 'vishnu' in the form of metal" Vishnu " 
 'vish' dhaatu ko unhone bhi vikalp se hi liya he or likhaa he ki "athwa nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup vishnu he; jaisaa ki vishnupurana main kaha he-- 'us mahatma kii shakti is sampoorn vishwa main pravesh kiye hue hai; isliye vah vishnu kehalaata he, kyonki 'vish' dhaatu kaa arth pravesh karnaa he"
 Major commentators of the Rigveda have also broadened the meaning of the word 'vishnu' with one voice
 vishnusukt kii vyakhya main acharya sayan 'vishnu' kaa arth vyapnsheel tathaa sarvavyaapak karte hai; to shripad damodar satavlekar bhi iskaa arth vyapaktaa se sambaddh hi lete hai
 Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati has also taken the meaning of 'vishnu' omnipresent universally and has also taken the meaning of supreme scholar in many places
 is prakaar suspasht parilakshith hota he ki 'vishnu' shabd 'vish' dhaatu se nishpann he or uskaa arth vyapanyukt he
 In the Vedic Dev-tradition, Vishnu's place is secondary to the numerical point of view of the Suktas because his eulogy is performed in only 5 Suktas; But if they are not looked at from a numerical point of view and consider them from other aspects, then their importance comes out very high
 rugveda main unhen 'brihachharir', yuvakumar aadi visheshnon se khyapit kiya gaya he
 The nature and characteristics of Vishnu mentioned in the Rigveda can be observed in the following points: - vishnu kii anupam visheshta unke teen paad-prakshep hai, jinka rugveda main baarah baar ullekh miltaa he
 Probably this is his biggest feature
 unke teen pad-kram madhu se paripurna kahe gayi hai, jo kabhi bhi ksheen nahin hote
 His three rankings are so elaborate that entire folk exist in them
 ‘tredha vichkramanh’ bhi prakaaraantar se unke teen paad-prakshepon ko dhvanit karata he
 The terms 'uruguay' and 'urukram' are also reflective of the said fact
 madhu se aapurit unke teen pad-kram main se do drushtigochar hai, teesraa sarvatha agochar
 This third highest position has been called the flight of birds and beyond the mortal eye
 yask ke purvavarti shakpuni in teen paad-prakshepon ko brahmand ke teen bhaagon-- prithvi, antariksh or dhuloak main surya kii sanchaar gati ke pratik maanate hai
 Yasak's predecessor Aurnavabha considers him to be the covenant of the rising of the sun, the position in the mid-day and the setting
 tilak mahoday inase varsh ke tridhavibhaajan kaa sanket maanate hai
 If seen, most scholars consider Vishnu to be a sun-vachhi, one of his footprints from midday till midday, second footfall from midnight to midnight and third footfall from postwar to posthumous rise
 inhen purvokt do paad-prakshepon ko drushtigochar or tisare ko agochar kaha gaya he
 But many scholars including mcdanal also say that in this sense how can the third stage be considered as 'supreme'? Therefore, they, like the aforesaid Shakpuni, consider the three steps to be the path through the three worlds of the solar deity
 surya kii kalpana kaa hi samarthan karte hue mcdanal ne vishnu dwaara apane 90 ashwon ke sanchalit kiye jane kaa ullekh kiya he, jinamein se pratye ke chaar-chaar naam hai
 Thus 90 multiplied by 4 numbers means 360 horse, which they consider to be integral since the days of a solar year
 vastutah vishnu ke do padon se sampoorn vishwa kii niyantranaatmakataa tathaa tisare pad se unka param dham arthath unki prapti sanketit he
 In the Rigveda itself, these three verses have been given a mysterious explanation
 isliye is pad ko gyanatmak maanakar rugveda main hi spasht kaha gaya he ki vishnu kaa param pad gyaniyon dwaara hi gyatavya he
 Although Vishnu is also considered to be a resident of Vani, but his most beloved abode, 'path:' is well-known in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan ne ‘giri’ pad ko shlisht maanakar uskaa arth 'vaani' ke saath-saath lakshanik rup main ‘parvat ke samaan unnat lok’ bhi kiya he
 If 'giri' is accepted in both these ways, then the problem is solved
 vishnu kaa teesraa pad jahaan pahunchataa he vahi unka awaas sthaan he
 The world of Vishnu is the 'ultimate post', that is, it is the best form of destination
 us ‘param pad’ kii visheshta yah he ki vah atyadhik prakaash se yukt he
 There cows with many horns transmit there
 ‘gaavah’ yahan shlisht pad kii tarah he
 The meaning of the physical confirmation of milk, etc
, when there is 'cow' meaning from the pun and 'rays', there is a lot of light that is easily permissible for light, that is, spiritual progress
 vishnu ke ‘param pad’ main madhu kaa sthaayee utsa he
 This 'madhu' is also rejoicing to the gods
 is shlisht pad kaa jo bhi arth kiya jaay par vah har sthiti main parmanand kaa vaachak he, jiske liye devtaa sahit samast praani abhilaashi bhi rahete hai or prayatnsheel bhi
 Therefore, everyone wishes for the attainment of the said world
 usee mantra main vahaan punyashalee logon kaa, tripti kaa anubhav karte hue ullekh bhi hua he
 a prominent feature of Vishnu is his friendship with Indra
 indra ke saahchary main hi unke teen paad-prakshepon kaa pravartan hota he
 Together with Indra, he destroys the 99 forts of the Shambar monster
 isi prakaar vah vrutra ke saath sangram main bhi indra kii sahaayta karte hai
 Both have also been described with some other powers
 is prakaar vishnu dwaara sompaan kiya janaa or indra dwaara teen paad-prakshep kiya janaa bhi varnit he
 In the Rigveda, Mandal 6, Sukta 69, there is a homage to the two deities
 isi prakaar rugveda ke mandal 5, sookt 87 main indra ke sahchar marudganon ke saath unki sahastuti praapt hoti he
 The word Vishnu derived from Vishnu Dhatu literally means 'broad, dynamic, functional or enterprising'
 apane bal-vikram ke hi kaaran ve logon dwaara stut hote hai
 They are eternal semen
 is gun ke kaaran hi unhen pratik rup se ‘vrishna’ bhi mana gaya he
 They are the cause of fear of enemies due to their semen or heroic deeds
 unase log usee prakaar bhaybheet rahete hai, jis prakaar kisi parvatachaari singh se
 With the utterances of 'parameshvaradbhiti', etc
, it is proved to fear the common people
 unase bhaybheet hona akaaran nahin he
 They are about to commit acts of violence etc
 yahan yah dhyatavya he ki ve kutsit hinsadikarta kaa hi vadh karte he
 Therefore it has been said for them that they are not murderers
 vishnu visteern, vyapak or apratihat gati vaale hai
 The terms 'urugay' and 'urukram' are a source of this fact
 ‘urugay’ kaa arth acharya sayan dwaara ‘mahjjanon dwaara stuyaman’ athwa ‘prabhutatya stuyaman’ karne se bhi vishnu kii mahima vikhandit nahin hoti
 Dr
 Yadunandan Mishra says that we are urged to make the meaning of this term 'with a wide speed', because it has been said to be a 'transmitter in all worlds'
 unke pad-kram itane sudeergh hote hai ki ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 If the creation of Vishnu's three stanzas, establish and hold them, then they also nurture dependent people there
 logon ko apana bhogy annadi unheen teen pad-kramon ke prasadswarup praapt hota he, jisase ki ve param tripti kaa anubhav kiya karte hai
 Those who praise Vishnu, they always do well, because their eulogy gives them the utmost energy
 is prakaar sphurti-pradaayini stuti vishnu tak pahunchaa paane ke liye sabhi lalayit rahete hai
 They are senior donors
 vishnu ke gunon main bhi trayaatmakataa parilakshith hoti he
 He is of three rank-order, three types of speed, measuring the three worlds and holding the Loktraya
 isi prakaar vah ‘tridhaatu’ arthath sat, raj or tam kaa samikrut rup athwa prithvi, jal or tej se yukt bhi hai
 Vishnu is the creator of earthly regions and the establishment of the most elaborate space etc
 ve swanirmit lokon main teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale hai
 These three movements symbolize their origin, status and merger
 is prakaar jad-jangam sabhi ke ve nirmaataa bhi hai, paalak bhi or vinaashak bhi
 He is the 'sole holder of Loktray'
 ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se akele hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 By measuring Loktraya, it also results that Loktraya means that the entire living beings are under his complete control
 vishnu bhrun-rakshak bhi hai
 Vishnu is prayed to protect the womb seed and the birth of a beautiful child
 unke paalak swaroop par spasht bal dene ke kaaran rugveda main ahoratr agnirup main bhi unhen 'vishnurgopa paraman paati

' arthath sabake rakshak-paalak kaha gaya he
 Acharya Saiyan also clearly considers Vishnu to be 'observant' in the interpretation of the twelfth mantra of the twenty-fifth Sukta of the Eighteenth Circle of the Rigveda

 Therefore, in the overall perspective, Vishnu has been called the supreme benefactor in the Rigveda
 sarvaadhik mantron main varnit hone ke baavjood indra ko 'sukrit' or vishnu ko 'sukruttarah' kaha gaya he
 'sukritarah' has been interpreted by Acharya Sayan as 'the best of those who give good fruit'; Shripad Satavalekar ji has given the meaning 'best among those who do good deeds' and Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati ji has also given the meaning 'ative best deeds
' indra 'sukrit' he to vishnu 'sukruttarah' hai
 The meaning is clear that it is assumed in the Rigveda that Vishnu is supreme
 isi prakaar indra ke raja hone ke baavjood vishnu kii sarvocchata rugveda main hi is baat se bhi spasht ho jaati he ki usamen vishnu ke liye kaha gaya he ki "ve sampoorn vishwa ko akele dhaaran karte hai" tathaa indra ke liye kaha gaya he ki ve rajya karte hai
 The meaning is clear that Vishnu, the creator and foster of the universe, has made Indra the king for operation
 is susandarbhit pariprekshya main vishnu kii sarvocchata se sambaddh brahman granthon evam baad kii puranic manyataayen bhi swatah udbhasith ho uthati hai
 In the Brahmin era, there was a lot of development of yajna-sanstha and with this, the importance of Vishnu in Deomandali became more than before
 aitarey brahman ke armbh main hi yajna main sthaan dene ke kram main agni se armbh kar vishnu ke sthaan ko 'param' kaha gaya he
 Among them is the place of other gods
 is tarah spasht rup se vaidic samhita granthon main sarvapramukh sthaan praapt agni kii apeksha vishnu ko atyucch sthaan diya gaya he
 In fact, Vishnu has been considered great in the Rigveda, but due to the lack of description, his place there is secondary
 brahman granthon main spasht kathan ke dwaara unhen sarvocch pad diya gaya he
 This superiority is also evident from the legend that Vishnu snatched the earth, Veda and Vani from the demons by his three steps and gave it to Indra
 vaidic vishnu ke teen pagon kaa yah brahmanon main kathatmak roopaantaran he; or isi ke saath vishnu kii sarvshereshthata bhi brahman yug main hi spasht ho gayi
 Aitareya Brahmin clearly considers Vishnu as the gatekeeper, the absolute protector of the gods
 rugveda tathaa brahmanon main uplabdh sanketon kaa puraanon main paryaapt parivardhan hua-- kathatmak bhi, vivarnaatmak bhi or vyaakhyaatmak bhi
 The Puranas have referred to Nirmal Parbrahma as Vishnu due to the absence of present, continual, unborn, Akshay, Avayya, Ekras and Hay at the core of this world
 ve 'paraanaa parah', intaraatma main avasthit paramatma, param shreshth tathaa rup, varna aadi nirdeshon tathaa visheshan se rahit hai
 They are devoid of these six vices - birth, growth, result, decay and destruction
 ve sarvatra vyaapt hai or samast vishwa kaa unheen main vaas he; isiilie vidvan unhen 'vasudev' kehete hai
 At a time when there was no day, night, sky, earth, darkness, light and nothing but these, at that time the only head man was Param Brahm, who is not the subject of senses and intellect
 sristi ke armbh main brahma ji ko vishnu ji ne jo mul gyanaswaroop chatupashloki bhagwat sunaaya tha, usamen bhi yahi bhav vyakt hua he -- sristi ke purv keval main hi main tha
 Apart from me, neither was gross nor subtle and neither was the cause of ignorance
 jahaan yah sristi nahin he, vahaan main hi main hoon or is sristi ke rup main jo prathit ho rahaa he, vah bhi main hi hoon or jo kuch batch rahegaa, vah bhi main hi hoon
 In these contexts, the supremacy of Vishnu and the feeling of being a Sarvnarshi is clearly reflected
 mana gaya he ki vishnu ke do rup hue
 The first form is the head man and the second form is 'kaal'
 ye hi donon sristi or pralay ko athwa prakruti or purush ko sanyukt or viyukt karte hai
 This time form God is eternal and eternal; Therefore, the origin, position and catastrophe of the world also never stop
 vaishnavon ke sirmaur tathaa 'puraanon kaa tilak' ke rup main maanya bhagwat mahapurana main sristi kii utpatti ke prasang main kaha gaya he ki sristi karne kii ichha hone par ekarnav main soye vishnu kii naabhi se camel kaa pradurbhaav hua or usamen samast gunon ko abhasith karne vaale swayan vishnu ke hi antaryami rup se pravisht hone se swatah vedamay brahma kaa pradurbhaav hua
 Similarly, in most Puranas, Vishnu has been accepted as the ultimate brahma
 unase sambaddh kathaon se puraana bhare pade hai
 Being a follower, they sometimes have to resort to various traps from the world view
 asuron ke dwaara rajya chin lene par punah swargadhipaty-prapti hetu devataaon ko samudr-manthan kaa paraamarsh dete hue asuron se chal karne kaa suzav dena; tathaa kamoddeepak mohini rup dharankar asuron ko mohit karke devataaon ko amrit pilaanaa; shankhachud ke vadh hetu tulsi kaa satitv bhang karne sambandhi devibhagwat tathaa shivpurana jaise uppuraanon main varnit kathaon main vishnu kaa chal-prapanch drashtavy he
 In this regard, it is important to note that being a follower, they see results
 kinhin varadaanon se asuron / anyaayiyon ke bal-vishisht ho jane ke kaaran yadi chal karke bhi anyaayi kaa ant tathaa anyaay kaa parimarjan hota he to ve chal karne se bhi nahin hichakate
 Killing Bali by hiding in Ramavatar and becoming the MLA of many tricks in the Mahabharata war in Krishnavatar is a reflection of his attitude
 chhidranveshi log inhen kathaon kaa upyog manamaani vyakhya karke ishwar-virodh ke rup main karte hai
 But it is necessary to look at them from the point of view of contextual knowledge, because in the Puranas or related texts, these passages are presented in the opposite situations only for the knowledge of specific duties beyond the ordinary
 dhyatavya he ki puraanon main tathvik gyaan ko hi brahm, paramatma or bhagwaan kaha gaya he
 The entire nature of Vishnu is cognitive
 puraanon main unke dwaara dhaaran kiye jane vaale aabhushanon tathaa ayudhon ko bhi pratikatmak mana gaya he :- In this way, Vishnu carries all the creative ingredients on his body
 vishnu kii akruti se sambandhit stutiparak ek shloke atiprasiddh he :- Shantakaram Bhujagasyanam Padmanabhan Suresham
 vishvadharan gagansadrushan megh varnan shubhangam
 
 lakshmikaantan kamalnayanan yogibhirdhyanagamyam
 Vande Vishnu Bhavabhayaharan Sarvalokakanatham
 
 Charity - whose shape is extremely calm, sleeping on the bed of Sheshnag, with a lotus in the navel, which is also the basis of God and the whole world of the gods, which pervades all the way to the sky, similar to Neelamegh , Extremely beautiful whose whole parts are attained by meditating by yogis, who are masters of entire worlds, who are destroyers of fear of birth and death, such Lakshmipati, a Lnetr God Srivishnu i salute
 vishnu kii sarvshereshthata kaa yah taatpary nahin he ki shiv yaa brahma aadi unase nune hai
 God does not have a high and low sense
 vah to lila main sristi-sanchaalan hetu sagun hone kii praathamikta maatr he
 Therefore, be it Vaishnava or Shaiva - all the best texts like Purana and Mahabharata declare with one voice that God is one
 kaha gaya he ki ek hi bhagavan janardan jagat kii sristi, sthiti or sanhaar ke liye 'brahma', 'vishnu' or 'shiv' -- in teen sangyaaon ko dhaaran karte hai
 There are many clear statements of Vishnu and Shiva being the same
 'avatar' kaa shabdic arth he bhagavan kaa apni swatantry-shakti ke dwaara bhautik jagat main moort rup se aavirbhaav hona, prakat hona
 The accomplishment of an avatar is considered in two conditions - one abandons one's form and eclipses the new form by action; And the second coming in a related form after taking a new birth, in which the condition of a situation in the womb of the mother is also included
 isamen atyalp samay ke liye rup badalakar yaa kisi duusare kaa rup dharankar punah apane rup main aa janaa shaamil nahin hota
 In the well-known seventh and eighth verses of the fourth chapter of Srimad Bhagavad Gita, God himself stated that the purpose of incarnation is that - whenever the loss of religion and the iniquity are uplifted, then for the sacrifice of gentlemen and the destruction of the wicked
 i originate in different eras
 iske atirikt bhagwat mahapurana main ek vishisht or adhik udaatt prayojan kii baat kahi gayi he ki bhagavan to prakruti sambandhi vruddhi-vinaash aadi se pare achintya, anant, nirgun hai
 So if they do not reveal their lila in the form of avatar, then how would the creatures understand their non-living qualities? Therefore, for the inspiring welfare of the creatures, he revealed himself and his leela
 isliye vibhinn avatar-kathaon main kai visham sthitiyaan hai jisase jeev yah samaj sake ki paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg kaisaa hota he! The first systematic list of incarnations of Vishnu is available in the Mahabharata
 mahabharat ke shaantiparv main avtaron kii kul sankhya 10 bataayi gayi he :- Swan: Kurmashta Matsyaash pradurbhava Dwijottam॥ varaho narsinghsch vamano ram ev c
 Ramo Dasharthischaiv Satvakat Kalkirev Chak arthath hans kurm matsay varah narsingh vaaman parashuram dasharathanandan ram yaduwanshi shrikrishna tathaa kalki -- ye sab mere avatar hai
 It has further been said that they are all past and future incarnations
 mulpath main varnan chah avtaron kaa he :-1
varah 2
narsingh 3
vaaman 4
parashuram 5
ram 6
krishna Since the Mahabharata is a work made before the birth of Buddha or before the imagery of Buddha being incarnate; So, naturally there is no sign of Buddha anywhere in it
 uske badale hans ko avatar rup main ginaney se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 The description of the avatar in the Dakshinatya text of Mahabharata is as follows: - matsay: kurmo varahashch narsinghsch vaaman:
 Ramo Ramscha Ramsha Krishna: Kalki Cha Te Dash
 yahan purvokt avtaron main se hans ko chhodkar tisare ram arthath balram ko jod dene se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 One thing can be proved from this account that till the time of Mahabharata, no more than ten avatars were imagined; Otherwise those Das avatars would not have been called 'all incarnations of the past and the future'
 baad main anya avtaron kii bhi kalpana prachlit hui or kul avtaron kii gananaa choubees tak pahunch gayin
 Despite counting 22 and 24 avatars in the Bhagavata Mahapuran, the majority of avatars have been the Mahabharata Das
 padmapurana, lingapurana, varahapurana, matsaypurana aadi anek puraanon main samaan rup se dash avtaron kii baat hi bataayi gayi he
 The description of Agnipuran is also exactly the same sequence
 is sandarbh kaa nimnaankit shloke praayah sarvanishtha he :- Matsya: Kurmo Varaashta Narasimhoth Vamana
 raamo ramashch krishnashch buddhah kalkishch te dash
 Thus, only the avatar of Vishnu is recognized
 inke sankshipt vivaran is prakaar hai :- Apart from Dashavatar, the names of fourteen avatars are as follows: - ghatyudi, bhanoli tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Gandmarajar or gandhilab or musk tomcat is a small mammal animal
 iskaa akar kuch-kuch billi se miltaa he, jis vajah se ise "bilav" kaa naam mila he, haalaanki yah billi kii nasl kaa praani nahin he

 They have a gland from which they produce their musk-like aroma
 aitihaasik rup se kasturi bilaavon ko markar unki granthi nikal lee jaati thi or uskaa prayog ittar banane ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 In the modern era, chemicals of this smell are collected from the living animal without coming out of the gland
 kasturi bilav ko angrezi main "siwat" or marathi main "udamanjar" kaha jaataa he

 'sat', 'samyak', 'samichin', 'bitkalak', 'nirdosh' aadi shabd praaia: ek se arth yaa bhav rakhte hai
 Darshan or vision is related to reverence; Knowledge is related to knowledge, perception or information; Character or attitude is related to behavior
 samyagdarshan, samyaggyaan tathaa samyak charitra jeevatma ke dharm ke trikalbaadhit lakshan hai
 These are called Ratnatraya and 'yoga'
 chunki inase moksh kii prapti hoti he, at: 'mokshamarg', 'sanhmaarg', 'shuddhmarg', 'shivamarg', 'nirvana maarg', 'ni:shreyasmarg' aadi bhi inke naam die gaye hai

 These martyrs and their other comrades started 'gadar' on 19 February 1915 against British colonialism that had occupied India

 The 'gadar' movement was not a peaceful movement, it was an armed rebellion, but the 'gadar Party' declared it openly by not giving it in secret and the Gadar Party's letter 'gadar', which was in four languages punjabi, Hindi, Urdu and Gujarati It used to come through - it had given a call to the entire Indian public
 america kii swatantra dharti se prerit ho apni dharti ko swatantra karwaane kaa yah shandaar aahvaan 1857 ke pratham swatantraaa sangram se prerit tha or british upniveshwaad ne jise avmaananaa se ‘gadar’ naam diya, usee ‘gadar’ shabd ko sammanjanak rup dene ke liye america main based bhartiya deshbhakton ne apni party or uske mukhpatr ko hi ‘gadar’ naam se vibhooshit kiya
 Just as the story of 1857 'gadar' i
e
 the first freedom struggle is very exciting, similarly the second armed struggle for freedom ie 'gadar' may also have failed but its story is no less interesting

 Like 1857, the 'ghadar' movement was a truly secular struggle involving people from all religions and communities
 gadar party andolan kii yah visheshta bhi rekhaankit karne laayak he ki vidroh kii asafalataa se gadar party samaapt nahin hui, balki isane apana antarrashtriya astitv bachaae rakhaa va bharat main communist party main shaamil hokar va videshon main alag astitv banaae rakhkar gadar party ne bharat ke swadhinata sangram main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya
 Later on, the youth rebellion of Punjab from 1925-26, whose popular hero became Bhagat Singh, was also strongly influenced by the Gadar Party and Kartar Singh Sarabha
 ek tarah se bhagat singh kaa vyaktitv va chintan gadar party kii parampara ko apanaate hue uske agragami vikaas ke rup main nikharaa
 Kartar Singh Sarabha became the hero of the Gadar Party in the same way as Bhagat Singh later became the great hero of the revolutionary movement during 1925 - 31
 yah aswabhaavik nahin he ki kartaar singh sarabha hi bhagat singh ke sabase lokapriy nayak the, jinka chitra ve hameshaa apni jeb main rakhte the or ‘noujvaan bharat sabha’ naamak yuva sanghathan ke madhyam se ve kartaar singh sarabha ke jivan ko slide sho dwaara punjab ke navayuvakon main azaadi kii prerana jagaane ke liye dikhaate the
 In every public meeting of 'naujawan Bharat Sabha', a portrait of Kartar Singh Sarabha was placed on the platform and a wreath was given to it
 kartaar singh sarabha, gadar party andolan ke lok nayak ke rup main apane bahut chote-se raajnneetik jivan ke kaaryakalapon ke kaaran ubhare
 Within two-three years Sarabha left such bright rays of his brilliant personality that he brightened the soul of the youth of the country in the color of patriotism
 aise vir nayak ko faansee dene se nyaayadhish bhi bachanaa chaahate the or sarabha ko unhone adaalat main diya bayaan halkaa karne kaa mashvira or vakt bhi diya, lekin desh ke navayuvakon ke liye preranastrot banane vaale is vir nayak ne bayaan halkaa karne kii bajaay or sakht kiya or faansee kii sazaa paakar khushi main apana vazan badhaate hue hansate-hansate faansee par jhul gaya
 This ghazal of Kartar Singh Sarabha was very dear to Bhagat Singh, he always kept it with him and often chanted in private: marmadeshm, jiskaa arth he rahasyamayi pradesh, naag dwaara nirdeshit ek tamil dharawahik he
 It aired between 1997 and 2001
 is dharawahik ke baari safalataa mili
 It is based on the TV serial short stories, which relate to supernatural events

 The intervention of Daulatrao Shinde on the question of succession on the death of Tukojji and the slaughter of Yashwantrao's elder brother Malharrao in the Tajjit war, motivated by a sense of vengeance, caused Yashwantrao to loot relentlessly in Shinde's kingdom
 ahilya bai kaa sanchit kosh haath aa jane se uski shakti or bhi bad gai
 In 1802, he defeated the Peshwa and Shinde forces together, which made the Peshwa flee Basai and made a treaty with the British
 falswaroop dwitiya angl-maratha yuddh chhid gaya
 Yashwantrao made a huge mistake in leaving the Marathas due to disharmony with Shinde because after the defeat of Bhonsle and Shinde, Holkar had to fight the British alone
 pehle ta yashwantrao ne monson par vijay pai, kintu, farrukhabad tathaa deeg main uski paraajay hui
 As a result, he had to enter into a treaty with the British
 Finally, he died at the age of thirty, in complete disarray

 This incident completely broke Yashwantrao
 unka apano par se vishwaas uth gaya
 After this he started strengthening himself

 It can be gauged from this that in 1802 AD they defeated the combined forces of Peshwa Bajirao II of Pune and Scindia and returned to Indore

 a new challenge had come before Yashwant Rao
 bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karana
 For this he needed the help of other Indian rulers
 ve angrejon ke badhate samrajya ko roak dena chaahate the
 For this, he again joined hands with Bhonsle of Nagpur and Scindia of Gwalior and decided to chase the British
 lekin puraani dushmani ke kaaran bhonsle or sindhiya ne unhen phir dhokhaa diya or yashwantrao ek baar phir akele pad gaye
 He once again urged other rulers to unite and fight against the British, but nobody listened to them
 iske baad unhone akele dam par angrejon ko chhathi kaa doodh yaad dilaane kii thaanee
 On 8 June 1804, he defeated the British army
 phir 8 july 1804 i
 main kota se unhone angrejon ko khaded diya
 On 11 September 1804 AD, the British general Wellesley wrote to Lord Luke that if Yashwantrao was not overcome quickly, he along with other rulers would drive the British out of India

 main angrejon ne dig par hamalaa kar diya
 In this war, together with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Bharatpur, he reminded the British of his grandmother
 yahi nahin itihaas ke mutabik unhone 300 angrejon kii naak hi kaat daali thi
 Suddenly Ranjit Singh too left Yashwantrao and joined hands with the British
 iske baad sindhiya ne yashwantrao kii bahaduree dekhte hue unase haath milaayaa
 The concern of the British increased
 lord ljuk ne likhaa ki yashwantrao kii sena angrejon ko maarane main bahut anand leti he
 After this, the British decided that a deal with Yashwantrao could only be done
 isliye unke saath bina shart sandhi kii jaae
 Whatever they want, they should be given
 unka jitna samrajya he, sab lautaa diya jaae
 Despite this, Yashwantrao refused the treaty

 In the end, when he did not succeed, he thought of defeating the British with another trick

 The British considered them independent rulers and returned all their territories
 iske baad unhone sindhiya ke saath milakar angrejon ko khadedane kaa ek or plan banaaya
 He wrote a letter to Scindia, but Scindia turned out to be a traitor and showed the letter to the British
 iske baad puraa maamla phir se bighad gaya
 Yashwantrao shouted and started preparing to beat the British on his own

 unhone 1971 main padam shri puraskaar praapt kiya
 Gaitonde was born in the Goa dynasty of Maharashtra
 unhone 1948 main sar jeje kala skool se diploma praapt kiya
 He died in 2001
 vasudev es gayatonde bharat ke sabase behtareen or ekantavasi amoort chitrakaaron main se ek mana gaya
 Vasudev Gaitonde was born in 1924 and received his diploma in 1948 from JJ Arts School, Mumbai
 unke kaam se prabhavit hokar, vasudev ko mumbai ke pragatisheel kalakaar samooh main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 He actively participated in group activities
 bharat ke saath-saath videshon main unki kai pradarshaniyaan yojit hui
 In 1956, he participated in the Indian Art Exhibition which was held in Eastern European countries
 unhone 1959 or 1963 main graham art gailaree, neuyark main yojit anya samooh pradarshaniyon main bhi bhaag liya
 Gaitonde's abstract works have been presented in many Indian and foreign collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York
 1957 main, unhen tokyo kii yuva asian kalakaaron kii pradarshnee main pratham puraskaar evam iske baad 1964 main rockfilor faillowship se sammanit kiya gaya
 In 1971, he was awarded the highest award given by the Government of India i
e
 Padma Shri for creative excellence
 gayatonde ne apni kritiyon main rup evam aakaar kaa atyadhik prayog kiya
 Vasudeva's shadow-like and diverse paintings present an incoherent and ambiguous description of the real world, although Gaitonde did not care at all to be conferred with the title 'abstractionist'
 Zen philosophy and ancient calligraphy had a profound influence on Vasudeva
 unki kalakriti ke bich, niyantran evam sampindit sanrachana ko sookshmata se chitrit kiya gaya dekha ja saktaa he
 Gaitonde preferred a slow and subtle painting process unlike his contemporary artists, due to which he presented only a few completed works
 gayatonde ke pratikatmak tatv or aadhaar rekhaon ke bahut kam prayog ne unki kriti ko ek bahati hui nadi kii tarah dikhaaya
 gayatonde kii kritiyaan hamen paul cli or jone miro kii yaad dilaate hai jinke saath unhonen apane college ke dinon ke dauraan adhyayan kiya tha
 Gaitonde's seductive scenes enthralled the viewer to admire his remarkable achievement and many of these people were impressed by the intensity of his poignant images
 He was unlimited in his vast understanding and compulsive spirit
 vasudev es gayatonde ni:andeh bharat ke sabase gambhir evam vicharottejak kalakaaron main se ek the, jinhone apni prakhyat upasthiti sthapit kii he or samakaleen bhartiya kala ke siddhant main apni divya drushti ko prabhavit kiya he
 Gaitonde was born in 1924 in a Goa family in Nagpur, Maharashtra
 unhone 1948 main je je kala skool, bombay se kala main diploma puraa kiya
 In 1947 and with another internationally renowned painter of Goa, Francis Newton Sausa, as well as other artist friends, with a wide awareness of the past being oppressed by colonial classical orthodoxy, he formed a 'progressive artist group' Established and empowered Indianness to pave the way for an international speech style
 This movement established today's vibrant art environment in the country keeping modern Indian art in perspective
 gayatonde is aitihaasik samooh kii gaun gatividhi main shaamil the, lekin yah unke saath hone vaali meri ek baatcheet main spasht hua, unhone kaha: "main isse alag tha
 "he was never indifferent to the group but as an individual it was the main feature of his artistic personality
 unke gaiyr-anusaarak prakruti ke saath-saath ek chitrakaar ke rup main unki pahchaan ke prati ek drudh vishvas tha or unki dridhtaa ke kaaran, gayatonde ne apane karier ke bahut aarambh main hi swayan ko apane parivesh kii un sabhi baton se alag kar liya jise ve ek chitrakaar ke rup main apni pahchaan ke liye apraasangik maanate the
 For years their development was characterized by an increasing internal state and a vigilant and conscious determination of this identity
 unke ek prashansak dwaara ek baar unhen "ek shant chitt vyakti or kalpana kii purna pahunch vaala ek chitrakaar" kaha gaya jo gayatonde ko sabase acchhee tarah paribhaashit karata he, jinamein ek bauddhik, vastut: kuch agyaat vichaar se andar hi andar ubalte rahane kii bahyakriti thi
 Ideologically, he never considered himself an abstract painter and he does not even like to be called so
 vastav main ve yah jor dekar kehete hai ki amoort chitrakala jaisi koi cheez nahin hoti, isaki bajaay ve apni kriti ko "gaiyr-vastunishth" ek prakaar kaa vaiyaktikrut chitralekh evam sulekh sambandhi avishkaar bataate hai jo chitrit sataha ko chaukaaney vaale sahaj bodh ke saath taaja karata he, jise unhone zen kii khoj karne main hone vaali anivaary baithak main samajha
 The thoughtful Zen quality reflected by his speech exemplifies the best of emotional silence, as silence is in itself eternal and expressive, in that the individual does not have a tendency to recognize mystical motifs
 gayatonde ke canvas main sahaj bodhon ke prakatikaran ke saath vibhinn rang-birange kramon main vibhooshit ucch rup se vyaktigat kiye hue chitralekh us sthaan ko kholana chaahate hai jise mastishk dwaara bhare jane hai
 In Gaitonde's paintings, structural textures with color interactions are the main tools that drive the painting's mysterious "self" into motion, it is sacred but intertwined, it is never obstinate
 unki rachanaaon main sajivta shaamil he jo ek gatij urja kii tarah vyavhaar-kushal dhang se santulit vinyas ko gati pradaan karti he, kyonki gayatonde ne unke nirupanon ko rup ke anubhuti ke dwaara niyantrit kiya jo anivaary tha
 He planned each structure in color, a part of his own internal monogamous life
 Since Gaitonde's art begins in an intensity that is constantly moving towards refining itself and every moment of them is philosophically reflective and so they find any thing in their inner spaces and momentary realities of creative inspiration Can not stop from the area
 unke chitra keval apane aap se sambandhit hai, prakriya parinaam he, kala main jivan ke saamaan hi gaiyr-vastunishth talleenta drudh hoti he
 Gaitonde obliges the viewer to stare at his paintings as they portray an amazing illusion of form, color and painting
 unamem saadhaaran si vastu ko aadhyatmik tatv main badal dene kii kshamta he
 The artist has tremendous talent and skill in cinematography which gives his work a never ending look
 vibhinn madhyamon ko purna rup se prabhavit karne evam canvas par mishrit karne ke liye gayatonde ek roller or ek rang milaane ke chaaku kaa upyog karte hai
 His artwork seems to excel with every element of it being extinct in some other way
 apane chamkile prakaash punjon ke saath unke amoort chitra gupt gahanta paidaa karte hai
 Gaitonde's work appears to have a reflective beauty strewn with huge flat surfaces on the canvas and subtle layers of color
 unke chitron main prakaash kii ek visheshta he jo ise puraa karti maaloom padati he
 His work creates colors and is then carefully removed for the desired effect prepared by Gaitonde

 Angkorthom and Angkorwat The expansion of the ruins of the ancient Kambuj capital and its temples
 angkorthom or angkorwat sudur purv ke hindchin main pracheen bhartiya samskruti ke avshesh hai
 Many colonies of migrant Indians had settled in the countries of the Far East since centuries ago
 hindchin, suvarna dweep, vanadweep, malaya aadi main bharatiyon ne kalantar main anek rajyon kii sthapana kii
 Situated in the northern part of present-day Cambodia, the word 'kambuj' is expressed, some scholars also refer to the Kambos who settled on the northwestern border of India with this ancient Indian colony
 anushruti ke anusaar is rajya kaa sansthaapak kaundinya brahman tha jiskaa naam vahaan ke ek sanskrit abhilekh main mila he
 In the ninth century AD Jayavarma III became the king of Kambuj and he laid the foundation of his capital named Angkorthom in about 860 AD
 rajdhani praaia: 40 varshon tak banati rahi or 900 i
 ke lagbhag taiyaar hui
 There are many legends in Kambuj literature regarding its construction
 pashchim ke simavarti thai log pehle kambuj ke samer samrajya ke adheen the parantu 14veen sadi ke madhya unhone kambuj par akraman karnaa aarambh kiya or angkorthom ko barbar jeeta or lutaa
 Then the Khmer had to leave their capital
 phir dhire-dhire baans ke wanon kii baadh ne nagar ko sabhy jagat se sarvatha pruthak kar diya or uski satta andhkaar main villin ho gai
 The city also mostly broke down into ruins
 19veen sadi ke ant main ek francisi vaigyanik ne paanch dinon kii nauka yatra ke baad us nagar or uske khandhiron kaa punaruddhar kiya
 The city slept for centuries on the north side of the great lake named Tonle Snake where the ruins of the huge temples stood nearby, on the other bank
 aaj kaa angkorthom ek vishaal nagar kaa khandhar he
 There is a 330 feet wide moat around it which was always filled with water
 nagar or khai ke bich ek vishaal vargakar pracheer nagar kii raksha karti he
 Many grand and huge Mahadwaras are built in the ramparts
 mahadwaron ke unche shikharon ko trishirsh diggaj apane mastak par uthaae khadey hai
 Five different Rajpaths from different gates reach the center of the city
 vibhinn akritiyon vaale sarovaron ke khandhar aaj apni jirnavastha main bhi nirmaankarta kii prashasti gaate hai
 Just in the middle of the city is a huge temple of Shiva which has three parts
 prayek bhaag main ek unchaa shikhar he
 The height of the middle peak is about 150 feet
 is unche shikharon ke chaaron ore anek chote-chote shikhar bane hai jo sankhya main lagbhag 50 hai
 The statues of Shiva are installed around these peaks
 mandir kii vishalata or nirmaan kala ascharyajanak he
 Its walls are decorated with various shapes like animals, birds, flowers and dancers
 yah mandir vaastukala kii drushti se vishwa kii ek ascharyajanak vastu he or bharat ke pracheen puranic mandir ke avasheshon main to ekaaki he
 The temples and buildings of Angkorthom, its ancient Rajpath and lake are all indicative of the prosperity of that city
 12veen shatabdi ke lagbhag suryavarma dwitiya ne angkorthom main vishnu kaa ek vishaal mandir banwaaya
 The temple is also guarded by a circular moat, which is about 700 feet in width
 dur se yah khai jhil ke samaan drushtigochar hoti he
 On the west side of the temple a bridge is built to cross this moat
 pul ke paar mandir main pravesh ke liye ek vishaal dwaar nirmit he jo lagbhag 1,000 foot chaudaa he
 The temple is very large
 isaki deevaaron par samast ramayana murtiyon main ankit he
 Seeing this temple, it is known that even after going abroad, Indian artists kept Indian art alive
 inase prakat he ki angkorthom jis kambuj desh kii rajdhani tha usamen vishnu, shiv, shakti, ganesh aadi devataaon kii puja prachlit thi
 The art which has been followed in the construction of these temples seems to be influenced by the Indian Gupta art
 angkorwat ke mandiron, toranadwaron or shikharon ke alankaran main gupt kala pratibimbit he
 Indian cultural tradition was alive in them
 ek abhilekh se gyaat hota he ki yashodharpur kaa sansthaapak naresh yashoverma ‘arjuna or bhim jaisaa vir, sushrut jaisaa vidvan tathaa shilp, bhashaa, lipi evam nrity kala main paarangat tha’
