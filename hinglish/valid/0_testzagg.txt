 But after the third battle of Panipat, the control of the Peshwa began to become very relaxed

 So Nana had to solve two problems simultaneously

 The British wanted to increase their empire, but Nana fought the enemy of the Marathas from the British year after year to win the Peshwa kingdom in addition to Sashti

 Various political, economic, religious, military and social reasons are given for the revolt of 1857
 kai itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki us samay ke janamanas main yah dharna thi ki, angrej unhen jabardasti yaa dhokhe se isai bananaa chaahate hai
 This was not completely wrong either, some company officers were engaged in the work of conversion

 angrejon ne bal vivaah pratha ko samaapt kiya tathaa kanya bhrun hatya par bhi roak lagaayi
 Cheating was also abolished by the British, but there is still doubt whether the thugs were a religious community or just a community of ordinary dacoits

 a major cause of the 1857 rebellion was the economic exploitation of Indians by the company
 company kii nitiyon ne bharat kii parmparik arthvyavastha ko puri tarah se samaapt kar diya tha
 Due to these policies, many farmers, artisans, laborers and artists became poor
 inke saath saath jameendaaron or bade kisaanon kii sthiti bhi badtar ho gayi
 In 1813, the company adopted a policy of one-way free trade, under which British traders were allowed to import completely, Indian goods made with traditional technology could not stand in front of it and the Indian urban handicrafts trade suffered unimaginable damage
 rail seva ke aane ke saath gramin kshetra ke laghu udhyam bhi nasht ho gayi

 Acting on this principle, Lord Dalhoji and his successor Lord Canning annexed Satara, Nagpur, Jhansi, Awadh under the rule of the Company
 company dwaara todi gadhi sandhiyon or vaadon ke kaaran company kii rajnatik vishwasniyata par bhi prashnchinh lag chukaa tha
 According to Lord Dalhousie's declaration in 1849, Bahadur Shah's successor would have to leave the historic Red Fort and go out of the city, and in 1856 Lord Canning's announcement that Bahadur Shah's successor would not be called a king, would drive the Mughals into a revolt against the company

 The soldiers were gradually dissatisfied with various aspects of the army's life
 sena kaa vetan kam tha
 The salary of Indian soldiers was just seven rupees per month
 or avadh or punjab jeetne ke baad sipaahiyon kaa bhatta bhi samaapt kar diya gaya tha
 The appalling rumors about the Enfield gun further boosted the soldiers' ambition that the company wanted to change their religion and caste
 vidroh kaa prarambh ek bandook kii vajah se hua
 Soldiers were given the Patten 1853 Enfield gun, a 0
577 caliber gun and was powerful and infallible in comparison to the old and brown bass that had been in use for decades

 Sepoy Sheikh Paltu was promoted to the zamindar in the Bengal Army
 anya regiment ke sipaahiyon ko yah dand bahut hi kathor laga
 According to many historians, the abolition of the regiment and the evacuation of the soldiers played an important role in the beginning of the rebellion, the disgruntled soldiers returned to Awadh with a desire for revenge and the rebellion gave them this opportunity

 Only Ratan Malkani was a famous thinker, politician and journalist of India

 He was an able thinker and writer
 shri keval ratan malkani kaa 82 varsh lambaa jivan ek nishthavan adarshavaadi, saidhantik, ni:swaarth karmyogi kaa jivan tha

 In those days the Communist Party of India was also working through the Congress under its United Front Policy and its student organization was attracting sensitive students in the Students' Federation schools by speaking the language of the national movement
 isliye keval ratan kaa yuva man bhi kuch samay students federation main sakriy rahaa
 But it was the Sangh Sangh's mobilization flow that took him within and from 1941 to 2003 he was a loyal volunteer of the Sangh
 chintamani ne bataaya ki 1946 main nagpur ke sangh shikshan varg main tritiy varsh shiksha ke samay unase pehali bhent hui or mitrataa main badal gai
 His elder brother NR During his speech in 1967-68, Malkani had said that if i had been born only during Ratan, i might have gone to the Sangh, because the young mind goes where there is idealism and selfless patriotism

aar
 malkani kaa gandhiji ke putr or hindustan times ke sampadak devdas gandhi se parichay tha
 At the invitation of Devdas, only Ratan moved to Delhi in 1948 and started working in the editorial department of Hindustan Times
 un dinon rashtriya swayamsevak sandh par pratibandh laga hua tha
 Eknath Ranade was living in Delhi and was organizing underground movement against the ban
 sangh ke paas "argeniser' naamak akelaa angreji saptahik tha
 In those days, the Sangh had few workers with the ability to write in English
 hindustan times main kaam karte hue bhi malkani ji kaa pratibandhit sangh se ghanishtha sambandh tha hi
 One day, Eknath ji asked him in a very simple way, "have you come to Delhi only for the job of Hindustan Times? Organizer is not in your mind?" This statement of Eknath ji created a storm in Malkani ji's mind
 unhone sochaa or agle din apana tyaagptr devdas ji kii mej par rakhkar ve argeniser main aa gaye
 This decision was not a simple one
 kahaan hindustan times ke madhyam se patrakarita kii yatra or kahaan argeniser ke abhavagrast kantakakirn maarg kaa varan
 Given the strength in Malkani ji's pen, the studiousness he had, the manner in which his routine was organized, disciplined and karmic, it can be said with confidence that if he was on that day because of his sincere and selfless instinct, Hindustan Times Had he not come in the Organizer except today, he would have been ranked among the top editors of the big daily papers of the country
 kintu unhone yash or vaibhav kaa rasta nahin chunaa
 From 1948 to 1982, he remained the pillar of union journalism
 1982 main argeniser se apane vidroh ke samay unhone bade maarmik swar main kaha ki main 26 varsh kaa yuva argeniser main aayaa tha or ab 62 varsh kaa boodha hokar usase vidaa le rahaa hum
 Because of his authorship, his studies and his fanatical observance, "organizer" was compelled to read critics of the Sangh as well
 dilli se angreji main prakashit hone ke kaaran "argeniser' hi sangh kaa ekmaatr pravaktaa ke rup main raajnneetik or bauddhik kshetron main pratishthit hua
 The ending of strangulation by the brunt of partition became the sole bold criticism of Muslim separatism and the appeasement policy of the Nehru dynasty as the "organizer" and its editor in a distinct place in India's political circles
 yadi yah kaha jaae ki sangh kii chhavi nirmaan main malkani or argeniser kii prabhavi bhoomika rahi he to koi atyukti na hogi
 After the lifting of the ban on the Sangh on 12 July 1949, when Malkani ji played a decisive role in the future about the future strategy within the Sangh
 argeniser main dow headgavar ke anany sahyogi evam sangh ke pratham prachaarak dadarav parmarth, balraj madhok or swayan malkani ji ne "camel' naam se ek lekhamala prakashit kii
 He urged that now the Sangh should move beyond its secular organization, Sadhana and contribute to the sacrifice of restructuring independent India through politics
 sangh ke varisht kaaryakarta kaa ek bade varg ke is disha main sochane ke liye argeniser ne pravrutt kiya yaa yon kahen ki unki manobhaavna ko abhivyakti di
 This was an act of great courage, because Malkaniji knew that Sarsanghchalak Shri Golwalkar was completely distraught with politics
 malkani ji bhartiya jansangh ke janmkaal se hi uske siddhantkaar ban gaye
 He had to bear all the burden of writing English
 unke hi aagrah par pan dinadayal upaadhyaay ne argeniser main saptahik "palitical diary' likhnaa prarambh kiya jiskaa kuch bhaag pustak rup main prakashit ho chukaa he
 i came to Delhi in 1964 as a lecturer in a college
 at: malkani ji se milanaa-julna prarambh ho gaya
 One day suddenly he called and asked to meet
 tab tak argeniser kanat place main marina hotel jaisi saaf-suthri kendriya jagah par pahunch chukaa tha
 This was definitely the result of Malkani ji's insistence
 main gaya to unhone bataaya ki hindi saptahik paanchajnya ko dilli laane kaa nirnay ho chukaa he or atal ji ne uske sampadan kaa bhaar tumhen saunpane ko kaha he
 i myself cannot read or write Hindi, but i will give you my full support
 ab tum roj yahaan aayaa karo
 i was somewhat hesitant that one day from the union office to self
 Baba Saheb Deoras was invited
 unhone kaha ki dilli main paanchajnya kaa sampadan bhaar tumhen hi sanbhaalanaa he
 And i started going to the Organizer Office
 tab malkani ji kii kaaryastylee ko nikat se dekhne kaa avasar mila
 There were only three persons in the editorial department of the Organizer - one Malkani ji, one his assistant Indrapal Singh and the third his personal secretary or whatever may be called Manohar whom he was fully dependent on and who is in the Hindustan Times today
 malkani ji aane vaali dak ko swayan padhate, lekhon kaa chayan karte, lekhakon se patrachaar karte, lekh kaa sampadan karte, antim pruf swayan padhate
 i remember that in those days both of us used to sit in the Indian Printing Works overnight and do the final proof reading
 itnaa kathor shram karne ke liye malkani ji apni dincharya main bahut sanyam baratate the
 He was not used to gossiping without reason
 aane vaale ko keval kaam kii baat karne kaa samay dete, unki ichha ke bina koi lambi baat nahin kar saktaa tha
 He was of an introverted nature, was not in his nature for unnecessary performance and meeting, but his conscience was pure and very transparent
 laag-lapet kii unhen aadat nahin thi
 He used to talk freely whenever he talked
 ve nirbhik the, ni:swaarthee the
 His life was very simple and difficult
 argeniser ke saadhan hi kitne the
 But he was very proud
 sampadak ke pad kii garima kaa bahut dhyaan rakhte the
 In theory, he considered the editorial department above journalism in journalism
 un dinon bharat prakaashan ke prabandh nideshak pad par goa ke vartmaansh rajyapal shri kedarnath saahani kaary kar rahe the
 Malkani ji and both of them were close friends with the relationship of Sangh and Jana Sangh
 kintu karyaalay main aane ke baad saahani ji unke liye keval prabandh nideshak rah jate the or tab unke rishton main sampadak pad kii garima pramukh ban jaati thi
 After some time leaving the Marina Hotel, we moved to our "sanskrit Bhavan" of Bharat Prakashan
 1971 main angreji main "madraland' naamak dainik patr prarambh hua
 Not only his editing, but his arrangement also fell on Malkani ji
 yadhyapi prarambh main times of india ke nivartmaan sampadak di
aar
 manakekar kaa naam sampadak ke rup main jaataa tha kintu sampadan kaa vaastavik bhaar malkani ji par hi tha
 Motherland had a direct fight with the Indira Gandhi government and it lacked advertisements
 patr ghate main chalata tha
 But he emerged as a strong voice in journalism and Indira Gandhi's government started considering Malkani ji as his biggest enemy
 25 june 1975 ko apatsthiti kii ghoshnaa ke baad malkani ji sabase pehle pakade gaye
 And the entire nineteen months were spent in jail after the emergency arising and the latter were released
 unke jail jivan kii kahani unki kalam se "midnit nauk' naamak pustak ke rup main saamne aayi
 "mother Land" was closed
 malkani ji pun: argeniser ke sampadak pad par waapas aaye or 1982 main 62 varsh kii aayu main argeniser ke sampadak daayitv se nivrutt hue
 But he was not tired, his body was fully fit due to the restrained diet
 jail jivan main unka muslim netaaon se ghanishtha sampark hua
 He further broadened and deepened his study of the history of India
 ab unki chintaa yah ban gayi ki vishaal muslim samaaj ko rashtriya dhara main kaise laayaa jaae
 How to build a bridge of communication with him
 vibhaajan kii vednaa unke man main gahari thi, akhand bharat kaa sapana unki ankhon main tha
 He had contact with Sindh
 sindh andolan ke pravartak ji
em
 said se bhi unka sampark bana hua tha
 He also came to India and met him
 at: muslim prashn par malkani ji kaa jo swar 1948 se 1975 tak tha vah ab thodaa-thodaa badalane laga tha
 But behind this change of voice, he was working the dream of nationalism and united India
 dilli main unhone sindhi samaaj ko sangathit karne ke liye manch kii sthapana kii or ve uske pehle adhyaksh bane
 Malkani's isolation from the Organizer in 1982 was not very common, some misunderstandings had arisen
 malkani ji bheetar hi bheetar bahut aahat the
 His financial condition was also not strong, his wife Smt Sundari and son Arvind started work on a small amount of money at Deendayal Research Institute
 parivaar ko chalaaya
 Malkani's pain never came on his face or lips
 main un dinon dinadayal shodh santhaan main avaitnaik nideshak daayitv par tha
 We were aware of Malkani ji's state of mind
 patrkaar unase kuch ugalvaane ke liye chakkar laga rahe the
 But he could not spill anything from Malkani ji
 koi samachar nahin bana sake
 He also attended the farewell event organized by Bharat Prakashan, rejecting his wife's request

 swami nigamanand paramhans bharat ke ek mahaan sanyasi ba sadguru the
 His disciples respectfully call him Sri Sri Thakur
 aisa mana jaataa he kii swami nigamanand ne tantra, gyaan, yoga or prem jaishe chaturvidh sadhana main siddhi praapt kii thi, saath saath main kathin samadhi jaise nirvikalp samadhi kaa bhi anubhuti laabh kiya tha
 From these spiritual experiences of him, there were five famous texts such as Brahmacharya means, Yogiguru, Gyaniguru, Tantrikguru and Premikguru in Bengali language
 unhone assam bangeey saraswat math jorhat jila or nilachal saraswat sangh puri jila main sthapana kii thi jo aaj bhi apana kaam kar rahaa he
 He had finished all the sadhana in just three years and Paramhansa became known as Srimad Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Dev
 swami nigamanand kaa janm tatkaaleen nadiya jila ke kutabpur main ek brahman parivaar main hua tha
 His childhood name was Nalinikanth
 unke pita bhuban mohan bhattacharya ek saral aadhyatmik byakti ke naam se suparichit the
 His mother, Manikya Sundari, died in his childhood
 satraa barsh kii aayu main halishar nibasi swargeey baidhnath mukhopadhay kii jeshth kanya ekadas varshiya sudhanshubala ke saath nalinikant kaa bibah samparn hua
 Nalinikanth, after this, completed the course of Sarbhe School and took up the job of obersier
 unke baad unhone deenajpur jamidari ke antargat narayanpur main naukari shuru kii
 One day while working in Narayanpur court, Sama was shocked to see Sudhadevi's shadow
 kuch der baad bah murti gaayab ho gai
 Later, after reaching Gambh, it was found that Sudhadevi did not live in this world
 is ghatana se uname paralog ke prati bishwas paidaa hua qi mrityu ke saath paralog kaa ghanishtha sambandh he
 In order to know this death and other elements, he joined the Theosophy community in Madras and learned his fortune
 bah dibangat sudhanshubala ko pratyaksh rup main dekhnaa chaahate the
 Therefore, due to lack of direct vision of the soul by bringing his soul within the medium, he could not be satisfied
 abhyaas karte samay unhen pataa chalaa ki hindu yogiyon kii krupa se unhen pratyaksh gyaan kii prapti hogi
 So Nalinikanth returned from Madras and started looking for Hindu yogis
 ek din raat ko nalinikant ne dekha, unki shayya ke paas ek jyotirmaya mahapurush khadey hokar kah rahe hen - "bats ! apana yah mantra grahan karo"
 Having said this, he gave Nalinikanth a monolithic mantra written on the bilvapatra and then disappeared within a moment
 uske baad nalinikant kaaphi khoj kii, phir bhi koi bhi unhen us mantra kaa rahasy nahin samajha paaya
 At that time, Nalinikanth resolved to commit suicide by being very uninspired and then fell asleep
 tatpashyaat ek bruddh brahaman ne swapn main kaha, betaa, tumhaare guru tarapith ke bamakshepa hen
 One day Nalinikanth saw at night, an astrological great man standing near his bed and saying - Bats! Take this mantra of yours
 itnaa kahkar unhone nalinikant ko bilvapatr par likhit ekakhyar mantra pradaan kiya or uske baad palabar main hi gaayab ho gayi
 After that Nalinikanth searched a lot, yet no one could convince him the secret of that mantra
 us samay bahut hi niru utchaya nirutchyhit hokar nalinikant ne aatm hatya karne kaa sankalp kiya or uske baad bah neend main so gayi
 Then an old Brahmin said in a dream, son, your guru is Bamakhepa of Tarapith
 nalinikant birbhum jile ke tarapith main sadhu bamakshepa ke paas pahunche
 Siddha Mahatma Bamapaksha survived to teach him the instrument system of mantra
 unki krupa se nalinikant ne debi tara ko sudhansubalaa kii murti main darshan kiya or devi ke saath bartaalap kiya
 Nalinikanth was unable to touch her even after seeing the goddess again and again
 iskaa tatv jaanane ke liye bah tantricguru bamakshepa ke upadeshaanusaar sanyasi guru ke khoj karne lage
 While searching for the Guru, he visited many places in India and finally got a glimpse of Swami Sachchidananda Saraswati in Pushkar Tirtha and was charmed by him
 On seeing Sachchidananda, Nalinikanth could know that the Mahatma who had given him the mantra in his dream, is the same Sachchidananda Swami
 nalinikant guru ke paas rahakar unke aadesh se anek shramsadhy kaary kiye
 Satisfied with his service, Gurudev gave him the reins of renunciation and named him Nigamananda
 sanyas lene ke baad tatv kii uplabdhi ke liye unhone guru ke aadesh par chardhaamon kaa bhamran kiya
 But for the difference in the element of which he achieved, for the achievement of that element, by the order of the learned master, he took leave of him and set out in search of the yogi guru
 yogi guru kii khoj ke samay, ek din banon ke romantic drishy ko dekhakar bah itane mohit o gayi ki din dhal jane ki baad bhi unhen pataa hi nahin chal paaya ki shaam ho chuki he
 As a result, he did not return to the colony and spent the night in a tree cover
 As the night passed, Paribraja Nigamananda saw a tall Tejasbi monk under the tree and followed him at his behest
 baad main us saadhune nigamanand ko apana parichay diya or unhen yoga shikhya dene kaa bachan dekar unhen apni kutiyaa main tehraaya
 By staying in the hermitage of the monk, Swami Nigamananda learned the skills of yogic tools and returned to the library to practice yoga under his command
 unke un yoga shikhyadaata guru kaa naam udasinacharya sumerudas maharaj he
 Nigamananda started living in Haripur village of Pavana district for the practice of Hatha Yoga
 sadhana main anek bighn paidaa hone ke kaaran nigamanand kamakhya chalem gayi or pahele savikalp samadhi praapt kii
 After that he attained nirvikalpa samadhi in Kamakhya mountain
 aisa mana jaataa he, nigamanand nirvikalp samadhi main nimagn hokar main guru hoon - yah swarup-gyaan lekar punah baapus aaye the
 Writer Durga Charan Mahananti wrote that Swami Nigamananda had become a Bairagi after leaving the world to know "I am" and returned to the world with the feeling of "I am a Guru"
 purnagyani, yah abhimaan le kar nigamanand kaashi main pahunche
 Thereupon Mother Arnapurna awakened the feeling of incompleteness within her and said, You have attained Brahman knowledge, but you did not get the knowledge of abhram brahmana, or the knowledge which is in the path of love and devotion
 isliye tum purna nahin ho 
 After that, by the grace of Shri Nigamananda Dev Prem Shiva Gauridevi, Abrah Brahm attained enlightenment and reached peak accomplishment
 prem siddhi ke baad swami nigamanand dev kii isht devi tara unhen pratakhya darshan dekar kaha tumhi saarvbhaum guru ho; jagat basi tumhaari santan he
 You go to the locality and give knowledge to your disciple devotee
 taradevi ke bakya se nigamanand ne apane ko purna samajha
 During this, Gurudev arrived at the Kumbh Mela to see Darshan
 bahaa unhone sab se pehle apane guru sachchidanand dev ko pranaam karne ke baad jagadguru shankaracharya ko pranaam kiya
 Other monks objected to that
 swami nigamanand ne uskaa sahi uttar dekar jagadguru ko santusht kiya
 When he correctly answered some of Jagadguru Shankaracharya's well-known questions, Jagadguru instructed his guru Sachchidananda to embellish him with the title of Paramhansa
 saadhumandali kii shraddha purna sammati se guru sachchidanand dev ne swami nigamanand ko paramhans kii oopaadhi di
 His full name was like this, Paribrajakacharya Paramhansa Sri Mad Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Dev
 desh baasiyon kaa manobhaav badal kar unhen pravriti se nivruti maarg main lautaane ke liye shri nigamanand ne yogi guru, gyani guru, brahmacharya saadhan, tantric guru or premic guru aadi grantho kaa pranayan kiya or sanathan dharm ke mukh patr ke rup main arya darpan naamak masik patrika kaa prakaashan kiya
 Apart from this, for the purpose of Bishtar of Sat Shikhaya and Sanatana Dharma, in the year 1912, in Jorhat stitched Kokilamukh he established the Shanti Ashram and performed the ritual of Sangha Sammelan
 sangh or sammelan ke madhyam se adarsh grihasth samaaj kaa gathan, sangh shakti kii pratishtha or bhav binimay karakar jagat baasiyon kii seva karnaa hi unka uddeshy tha
 Sri Nigamananda enlightened the disciple-devotees and the general public by preaching to do jive service with the knowledge of Narayana
 is prakaar bahut hi kam samay ke bheetar bengal, bihar, assam or brahmadesh ke kuch khetron main upani bhavadhaara kaa byaapak prachaar par unhone assam stit math chhod diya or be jivan ke shesh bhaag ko puridham main nirjan baas main bitaane lage
 In order to unionize the devotees of Odisha, he instructed the Shravan Purnima of his auspicious birthday year 1934 to preach his spiritual sentiment by offering nilachal Saraswat Sangh
 adarsh grihasth jivan yaapan karke sangh shakti kii pratishtha karne ke saath saath unhone shishy bhakton ko bhav binimay karne kaa upadesh diya
 Swami Nigamananda said, you can meditate on your Gurudev in the place of Ishta-deva, that is why Ishta and Guru is abhirna and one
 jagadguru shankar kii matt or mahaprabhu gaurang dev kii path yah adarsh apnaane keliye shishy bhakton ko aadesh diya he
 In this way, he moved to Calcutta due to his general malaise by moving to Puridham

 angreji shabd "charter", latin "charta" se niklaa he, jiskaa arth hota he 'kaagaj yaa usapar likhi koi cheez'
 This modern form of epigraphy took place

 Bhojpatra, Talpatra, Tamrapatra, silk cloth etc
 were different forms of paper itself

 vartmaan samay main yah parampara praaia: samaapt ho chuki he; tathaapi england main is rup main rajya ab bhi saarvajanik sansthaaon kaa sanad pradaan karata he
 a prominent illustration of the epigraph in the present era is the Gazetted Company

 In the present era this type of company is seen as a prosperous one

 electronic main nirvaat nalee ek aisi yukti he jiskaa kaary nirvaat main vidyut dhara ke pravaah par aadhaarit he
 It is also known as electron tube, thermogenic valve or simply 'tube' or 'valve'
 inamen ek tapt philament se nikalne vaale electron nirvaat main gati karke anode par pahunchate hai jo cathod kii apeksha adhik voltata par rakhaa gaya hota he
 The emergence of vacuum tubes played an important role in the birth and development of electronics
 pratham tapayanic nalee ko fleming ne san 1904 main banaaya tha jise dwidhruvi kehete hai
 As already written, bipolar has two poles
 ek dhruv electron kaa nissaran karata he or doosraa pehle dhruv kii apeksha dhan vibhav par rakhaa jaataa he, tab vidyuddhara pravaahit hoti he
 But this stream is unidirectional
 yadi pattica ko runagra kii apeksha dhan vibhav par rakhaa jaay to, jaisaa upar likhaa ja chukaa he, electron dhara pravaahit ho jaati he
 But if the voltage is applied in the other direction, that is, if the plate is at the negative potential rather than the minus, then the electron current will not flow at all, because electrons will not come out of the plate without heating the plate
 is kaaran nalee main electron dhara keval ek hi disha main pravaahit kii ja sakati he
 If the source of the alternating current is diverted across a series of bipolar and electrical loads, such as a resistor, through a series connection, the current will flow only in one direction and no current will flow in half the cycle of the alternator
 in dishaao main nalee prayavarti dhara ke badale vidyut ko bhaar main keval ek disha main chalane detii hai
 At first the filler current rises slowly, then some quickly and finally settles, which is called saturated current
 yah santrupti antaran aavesh ke kaaran ho jaati he, jo bhatke hue electranon ke kaaran runagra ke nikat prakat ho jaataa he
 The filler current in bipolar can be represented by the following equation: isamen Ip = dwidhruvi main pattic dhara; k = the constant that depends on the geometry of the tube; v = dwidhruvi kii pattic voltata As mentioned above, in bipolar the current flows in only one direction
 is kaaran is nalee kaa upyog prayavarti dhara ke rujukaran main kiya jaataa he
 In this, the alternating current is converted into direct current
 isko 'ardh tarang rujukaran' kehete hai
 Those dipoles, which are used in the desorption of high voltage reversal current, are called cannatrans
 gasayukt dwidhruvi kaa upyog shaktishaalee dhara ke rujukaran main kiya jaataa he, udhaahrant: sanchayak badariyon ko aaveshtit karne main tungar rujukari ek gasayukt rujukari he
 Leiben made an important discovery in Germany and Lee the Forest in America
 unhone dwidhruvi ke donon dhruvon ke madhya ek atirikt dhruv laga diya or yah paaya ki is prakaar kii nalee, jise tridhruvi kehete hai, bahut hi laabhakaari he
 In the absence of this third pole, as stated earlier, the thermogenic current in the tube flows only when the material is at a voltage potential rather than a positive minus
 isko pattic dhara kehete hai
 This increases along with the band voltage until the transfer charge appears
 uske prakat ho jane par yah sthir ho jaati he, arthath pattic dhara pattic voltata ke badhane par nahin badhati
 When the third pole is placed between the two poles of the tube, it starts controlling this transfer charge
 is kaaran grid ko antaran-aavesh-niyantrak kah sakate hai
 If the grid potential is less than the negative potential, the grid throws the electrons backwards and the filler current decreases
 yadi grid vibhav runagra vibhav se adhik rahata he to pattic dhara bad jaati he
 Then, another advantageous feature is the change in grid current with grid current or grid voltage
 grid dhara athwa grid voltata main thodaa hi parivartan pattic dhara main paryaapt parivartan laa saktaa he
 This device is used in amplifiers
 pattic dhara teen swantatra charon par nirbhar rahati he
 They are the band voltage, grid voltage, and voltage used to heat the negative
 jab ushma voltata ko itnaa adhik badha diya jaataa he ki paryaapt utsarjan hone lage, to dhara keval antaran aavesh ke niyantrit hoti he
 Then the band voltage is the function of only two independent variables
 ve hai plate voltata or grid voltata
 This function cannot be represented by a curve in a plane
 yah tri-ymik sataha main hi pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Although special information can be obtained from this type of curve, there is a lot of inconvenience to display it
 is kaaran isko teen prakaar kii vakr rekhaon dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he jinhen sthir lakshanik kehete hai
 A) are jaisaa bataaya ja chukaa he, tridhruvi kaa mukhya upyog pravardhakon main hota he
 It is also used in the forms of dolka, rujukari, introductory and sculpture
 ucch aavriti-pravardhan-kriya main tridhruvi ke prayog se yah haani hoti he ki pattic or grid ke bich ke madhyadhruvi dharitra ke kaaran donon ke paripath yugmit ho jate hai
 Because of this the function of the triploid at high frequency becomes unstable
 is yugman ke kaaran valve dolan utpann karne lagata he, jisase besuri dhwani aane lagati hai
 This disruptive fraction is overcome by placing another grid in the quadrilateral between the positive and the grid
 is grid ko dhan vibhav par rakhte hai
 This voltage is less than the potential of the plate
 is grid kii upasthiti main dhanagar paripath tathaa grid paripath yugmit nahin hote or dolan nahin utpann hota
 This grid is called the cover grid
 aavaran grid kii upasthiti se ek or laabh hota he
 Cationic electrons are less conscious in controlling drift than triploids, because the casing grid is more effective than the positive ones due to the nearness of the negative
 isse pravardhan bad jaataa he
 In quadrilaterals, control grids and arrays are set up in the same way as trident
 isliye donon hi naliyon main grid-pattic chaalakata praaia: samaan hoti hai parantu chaturdhruvi main pattic pratirodh rtridhruvi kii apeksha paryaapt adhik hota he
 The reason for this, as noted above, is the minimal effect of the filler current on the band voltage
 chaturdhruvi ke upyog main ek dosha he
 This is secondary emission of plaque
 pattic se jab atyant vegagami tapayanic electron takaraate hai to pattic se gaun utsarjan hone lagata he
 Due to the emission of secondary electrons from the fillet and being attracted towards the mantle, there is a spasm in the affluent morphology
 is anthan ke kaaran nalee main vikruti tathaa asthirataa aa jaati he
 To overcome this, a third grid is placed between the casing grid and the positive
 is grid ko damankaaree grid kehete hai tathaa is nalee ko, jisamen paanch dhrav hote hai, panchadhruvi kehete hai
 The oppressive grid is often interrelated with the debt
 iskaa kaary gaun utsarjan electron ko dabaanaa he
 The presence of a repressive grid on the main electron current has no specific effect
 yah keval gaun utsarjan kaa avrodh karata he
 Panchpolar is mostly used in high frequency irradiated amplification
 is nalee ne praaia: radio-aavriti-vibhav-pravardhak main chaturdhruvi ke upyog ko visthapit kar diya he
 The reason for this is that the use of Panchdhruvi leads to high potential amplification at medium-plate-potential
 panchadhruvi tathaa chaturdhruvi main kabhi-kabhi niyantrak grid ko ek vishesh abhipraay se ek samaan nahin banaate
 Grids at both ends reduce the spacing of the wires
 is prakaar kii nalee bahut si naliyon ke samaantar samooh ke rup main kaary karti he or in naliyon ke bhinn bhinn pravardhan-gunankhand hote hai
 As soon as the grids convert the voltage to negative, the high amplitude-section portions of the grid are cut off and do not carry the electron current, but have no effect on the other parts
 yadi grid rinatmak he to is bhaag se bhi ilekatron dhara bah sakati he
 Therefore, the electron current is usually constant and the amplification multiplication section changes
 is prakaar kii nalee ko char-pra-nalee kehete hai
 It is mostly used in the circuits of a self-propelled announcer
 chaturdhruvi tathaa panchadhruvi banane ke uparaant yah bodh hua ki aavaran grid tathaa pattic ke bich ke antaran aavesh kaa upyog gaun utsarjan ke baadhak ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 This is why the transfer charge is used in the pulp tube
 helical niyantrak grid tathaa aavaran grid ke taratv ko samaan rakhaa jaataa he or unke taron ko is prakaar lagaaya jaataa he ki un electranon ko ek belanaakaar sataha main ekatra kar den jo pattic tathaa aavaran grid ke bich main hon
 For this reason, this cylindrical surface is at the potential of the minuscule and throws back the electrons emitted from the fillet
 is prakaar yah gaun utsarjan ko rokane main safal hoti he
 Occasionally some special capacitance tubes attach oppressive grids to one side, but the cylindrical surface created by the charge charge is particularly effective in preventing secondary emission
 punjashkti nalee kaa pattic lakshanik main yah visheshta he ki vah adhik tikshnata se mudati he
 For this reason Punjashakti Hose is better than a Panchdhruvi
 vakrarekha kaa mode bahut hi tikshn hai or iske pashchaat vah praaia: sidhi he
 The horizontal portion of the curvilinear is accompanied by a substantial portion of the change in fillet voltage
 is kaaran is nalee kaa upyog karne se adhik shakti milti he
 Due to this special way of wiring, the casing-grid-stream is less than the filler current in panchpulvi
 dwidhruvi, tridhruvi, chaturdhruvi tathaa panchadhruvi ke vibhinn mail jab ekahi kaksh main banaae jate hai to unhen bahu-ikai-nalee kehete hai
 The characteristics of such polypolar or polycystic tubes are not very different from those that have been studied
 tathaapi aisi bhi bahudhruvi naliyaan hai jinamein keval ek hi runagra tathaa keval ek hi dhanagar rahata he, parantu grid teen se adhik rahete hai
 There are two control grids in such tubes and the control of the filtered current is done by the combination of both the voltages
 duusare gridon kaa kaary yaa to aavaran kaa hota he yaa pattic se gaun utsarjan ko dabaane kaa hota he, jaisaa chaturdhruvi tathaa panchadhruvi main hota he
 Sometimes the work of a grid, which rests on the money potential, is in the form of a supporting plate
 is pattic kii dhara kisi ek niyantrak grid kii voltata par nirbhar rahati he
 If there are two control grids in this type of tube and the voltages of both are changed, then the change of the filler current is proportional to the common factor of the change of voltage of both the grids
 is gunankriya ne is prakaar kii naliyon ko un paripathon main upyogi bana diya he jahaan vishesh prakaar ke murchak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The main use of multipolar electron tubes is in frequency conversion, that is, to change the voltage of one frequency to the voltage of another frequency
 iskaa udhaaharan ek panchagrid mishrak he
 In addition, multipolar tubes are being used, in particular, in automatic conduction control and oscillator, in which the voltage across one controller grid is controlled by the voltage in the other controller grid

 In December 1941, the Hitler forces were dismembered and repelled near Moscow
 pehali baar fasist senaaon ko itani sakht paraajay kaa munh dekhnaa pada
 This led to an appeal from the Soviet government to raid the people of the territories occupied by the fascists, and in these areas there were many raiding squads and secret organizations which started the struggle against the fascist attackers and the vast front But assisted the fighting Soviet forces

 To suit these circumstances, the warring allies of the Soviet Union - Britain and the United States - landed their troops in Normandy on 9 June 1944
 is tarah pashchimi europe main doosraa morcha akhir khulaa to, magar do saal kii deree se
 Fascist Germany could not compete with the forces of the warring allies of the Soviet Union, because all its main forces were engaged on the soviet-german front

 Therefore, the British government appealed to the government of the Soviet Union to start an attack on the Red Army squads on the soviet-german front
 soviet sarkaar ne laal sena ke daston ko aadesh diya ki ve 12 janvari 1945 ko, nirdhaarit samay se dedh hafte pehle hi hamalaa shuru kar den
 The campaign of Soviet squads began simultaneously on the vast front from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains

 Sixty-one Hindi literature is a literature composed by a generation in which the tone of rebellion and anarchy was predominant after the year 1960, under the history of Hindi literature, which is largely believed to be quite different from the New Age era
 haalaanki iske saath-saath sahajata evam janavaadee chetana kii samaanaantar dhara bhi sahitya-kshetra main pravahamaan rahi jo baad main pradhan ho gayi
 In the sixties, the rebellious consciousness movement became primarily vocal in the field of poetry
 isliye isse sambandhit saare aandolan mukhyatah kavita ke aandolan rahe
 However, the story and other genres too had a substantial impact and in the field of story also, a movement like 'akhani' took shape
 san saath ke aasapaas nayi kavita kii dhara apane se kuch alag hoti dikhne lagi
 The new twist that is targeted after sixty is not a new thing to look at all of a sudden, but only by new poetry
 saath ke baad kii kavita main asantosh, asweekruti or vidroh kaa swar bahut saaf taur par ubhara he
 The tone of dissatisfaction and disapproval is present in the new poem as well, but after sixty this tone has taken the form of more intense satire and rebellion, going too close to the broken idols of life, their brokenness, agony and rejection from it Has recognized the fierceness of nayi kavita kii sabase badi visheshta yahi he ki usne samgr jivan kii pramanik anubhutiyon ko unke jivant parivesh main vyakt kiya
 He understood the significance of the poem only in highlighting every small and big truth of life through symbols and images, by breaking the siege of the subject or cognition of the subject and made of different visions or promises
 lekin kul milakar nayi kavita ke kaviyon main pidaa ke baavjood bhavishya nirmaan ke prati sakaaratmak aashaa bhi bani rahi
 Due to the conditions of post-independence India, there was a lot of frustration and breakdown in them, but there was also a weak hope of fulfilling dreams
 mohabhang yaa disilusenment puure rup main nahin hua tha, isliye nayi kavita main yatnaa-bodh he, asweekruti kaa swar bhi he, kintu vidroh kaa ubhaar nahin he
 Gradually 'illusion' broke down, disillusioned
 vyakti kaa saamaajik parivesh or bhi kurup lagane laga, bhavishya ke sapane tuutate gayi
 In the words of Dr
 Bachchan Singh, there was no light in the sun grown by the poets - the reception of the sun went in vain
 anek sahityakaron ko do hi raste najar aane lage ki yaa to ve nayi kavita ke pradhan swar main swar milakar pidaa kii mukt anubhuti ko or gahanta se vyakt karte athwa ye sari paristhitiyaan unke samvedansheel man ko jhakazorkar or yatnaa ke bich se ubhar kar unhen vidrohi banaati hui sab-kuch asweekaar karne ko prerit karne lageen
 Both these streams remained in the literature, but immediately after the sixties, the rebel stream was predominant, most of which were malevolent or sexually perverse
 nirlakshya hone se ye kavitaayen suvidhaatmak rup se vidroh karne vaali huin yani jahaan vidroh karne main khatra anubhav ho vahaan nahin, jahaan suvidha ho vahaan vidroh hota rahaa
 The first decade of Sathotari Hindi literature is particularly influenced by modernism
 is sandarbh main dhyatavya he ki aadhunik or aadhuniktaa main antar he
 'modern' reports separation from 'medieval'
 'aadhunik' vaigyanik avishkaron or audyogikaran kaa parinaam he jabaki 'aadhuniktaa' audyogikaran kii atishyata, mahanagareey ekresata, do mahayudhon kii vibheeshikaa kaa fal he
 According to Dr
 Bachchan Singh, "modernity" is actually the name of new, non-romantic and non-romantic interviews of heterogeneous human conditions arising as a result of new science and technology
 " Modernist literature is a special kind of literature
 yah sthapit samskruti, mulya or samvednaa ko asweekaar karti he
 It does not accept the beliefs of the world, adopting the tradition as fetters
 aadhuniktaavaadi antaryaatra karata he, mulyon kaa makhul udaata he, vah vidrohi hota he
 Opposes the crowd, is a believer of the person's salvation
 vah apane ko a-maanav kii sthiti main paata he, or sneh, kritagyata aadi ko nishkasit kar detaa he
 Its characteristics or 'motif' are lack of restraint, experimentation, sabotage of literature forms, attitude of giving shock, aspiration for resentment-violence etc
 nayi kavita se vilgau anubhav karte hue kavy-kshetra main jo anek pravritiyaan sakriy raheen, unamem sabase adhik ullekhneey he ginsburg aadi america bitanicon tathaa unase prabhavit bengal ke malay raichaudhuri or subimal basaa jaise bhukhi peedi ke kaviyon ke samanaantar hindi main ubharne vaale raajakmal choudhary tathaa akavita or asweekrut kavita se sambaddh kuch anya kavi jinhone 'hetro sexuality' evam 'open sikresi' kii beet dharanaon ko apanaakar samaaj se apane ko 'disephiliet' karne kaa praytn kiya
 Nude use of sexual terminology in his poetry is often found in the form of rites and mutilation to express his distress and resentment
 raajakmal choudhary ko is dashak kii aguwai karne vaala kavi mana gaya he
 Modernity is seen in its totality in Rajkamal Chaudhary
 is samay kii adhikansh rachanaaon par choudhary kii chhap dekhi ja sakati he
 The Beatnik movement came to Hindi as a fashion and in no time became disinterested because its roots were not in the realities of the country
 vastutah ye gusse ke kavi the
 He kept venting his anger in his angry speech
 purvavarti samast mulyon or paramparaon ko nakaar kar ve apni chikhon, jakhmon or yon-vidrupataaon ko kavita main vyakt karte rahe
 However, the euthanistic, neo-progressive or neo-progressive poets, while emphasizing social values, expressed their disagreement with these beatniks
 nayi kavita ke uparant hindi kavy ke kshetra main thodi si hi avadhi main itane adhik naare sunai diye, itane adhik aandolan aaye ki vishwa ke kisi anya sahitya main itani kam avadhi main itane adhik naare or andolan kabhi nahin utpann hue
 Some of these movements and slogans were buried in the neck of time, but some grew on the path of development
 vastutah in andolanon kii poshak rachanaayen ek-duusare se milti-julati bhi raheen tathaa kabhi-kabhi to ek hi kavi kai andolanon kaa anugami rahaa
 This time of literature was a time of chaotic flood of movements
 mukhyatah kavita-pradhan in andolanon ke naam is prakaar hai- There were many pro-system movements along with anti-system movements in the poetry-movements that came like floods in this decade; But often there was a lack of systematic thinking in all these movements, due to which almost all these proved to be short-lived
 in donon prakaar ke mukhya andolanon kaa saamaanya parichay agrankit sheershakon main drashtavy he
 In the March 1962 issue of 'bharati', Sri Virendrakumar Jain announced the new poem 'sanatan Suryodayi'
 apana mantavya vyakt karte hue unka kahana tha ki " patan-paraajay, kuntha, atmpidana or jivit aatmghaat ke asujh andhkaar main aatmahaara dishaharaa hokar bhatak rahi aaj kii anaath kavy chetana ke sammukh ham-- alp se mahat main le jane vaali, andhkaar se prakaash main le jane vaali, mrityu se amrit main le jane vaali or seemaa main aseem kii lila ko utaar laane vaali-- aagaamee kal kii anivaary sanathan suryodayi nutan kavita dhara kaa dwaar mukt karte hai
 "thus the main tone of this movement was of the system, but only after 3 years, in the February 1965 issue of 'bharati', instead of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita', the tone of 'nutan Kavita' was heard
 gangaaprasad vimal jaise 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke bhootpurv samarthak swayan 'akavita' varg main sammilit ho gayi
 The Yuyotsavist poem is related to a magazine called 'yuyutsa'
 yuyutsavadi kavita ke pravartak shalab shriram singh the
 He has been of the opinion that primitive Yuyutsa is the main inspiration of literature
 unka kahana he ki "main sahityasarjan kii mul prerana ke rup main usee aadim yuyutsa ko sweekaarta hoon jo kahin na kahin prayek kranti, parivartan athwa vighatan ke mul main pramukh rahi he
 It can be anything young, zoological, puerile, platonic or platonic
 " april 1965 kii 'roopambara' main 'prarambh' ke antargat swadesh bhartiya dwaara 'sabakaa ek maatr kaaran yuyutsa' kii ghoshnaa karte hue shalab shriram singh kaa yah uddhran diya gaya tha
 'rupambara' itself appeared in the 'adhyunatan Kavita issue' of August 1966 as a 'yuyotsavist Navlakhan Pradhan co-operative effort', with statements from three poets
 sampadak ne nayi samvedansheeltaa kii baat bhi uthaayi
 Vimal Pandey, Rameshwaradatta Manav, Om Prabhakar, Bajrang Bishnoi etc
 also related themselves to this movement
 vimal pandeya ne 'yuyutsawad' ko 'engri yang main' se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya
 Shri Om Prabhakar considers Yuyutsa as a synonym for Jeejivisha, considering 'wariness' to be an eternal instinct
 bajrang bishnoi ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko yuyutsa se jod diya he
 In the July '66 issue of 'utkarsh' magazine, Shriram Shukla raised the slogan of 'rejected Poetry' and introduced 'long Rejected Poem' titled 'sexual intercourse with dead woman'
 shukla ji ke liye 'sambhog kaa anubhav hi paryaapt he-- saat mahakavy likh le jane ke liye
 The poet of the spokesperson of the rejected poem believes - "the asymmetry of not telling the truth as truth is sometimes broken by breaking the barrier and only then is the birth of the rejected poem
" " tathaa "prastut yug main vyaapt, yatharth hote hue bhi asweekrut vishisht pravritiyon, sanvegon, sthitiyon, mulyon, asangatiyon or mood kii sampreshak kavita he
 "rejected poetry is a poem of sexual perversions
 ashleel shabdon kaa prayog inke liye sahaj sweekrut he tathaa inke anusaar ye 'naapsand vyavasthaaon ko badalane ke liye' vyagr hai
 Even if they cannot present a solution, they consider it their duty to 'draw the attention of the insane people by putting question marks on them'
 'akavita' kaa sutaradhar dow0 shyaam parmaar ko mana gaya he, parantu jagadish chaturvedi bhi unke saath baraabar ke bhagidaar the or 'akavita' ke aarambhik prastaavkon main the
 In fact, there were three editors of 'akvita' magazine - Jagdish Chaturvedi, Shyam Parmar and Rabindranath Tyagi
 'akavita' patrika main akavita ke samarthan main saidhantik lekh praayah nahin chaape jate the
 Those people believed that 'we will not speak'
 parantu, dow0 shyaam parmaar ne akavita ke samarthan main 'akavita or kala-sandarbh' sheershak se baqayada pustak bhi likhi, jisamen bahuvidh akavita ko paribhaashit karne kaa praytn kiya gaya
 Jagdish Chaturvedi calls this poetry as 'abhinav Kavya', due to the awareness of the monotony, inconsistency and sacramental expression of life lived on the intellectual level by the poets of this class and separation from the ancient tradition of poetry
 Are that "they can be enumerated as meaningful carriers of 'anti-poetry'"
 " parantu shyaam parmaar akavita ko anti kavita yaa kavita virdohi nahin maanate
 They consider Akavita to be an 'investigative poem of contradictions'
 unke anusaar is kavyandolan kii visheshta is tathy main he ki "kaviyon kii pravritiyaan alag-alag manahosthitiyon se judi hai
 "" Akavita is a tenacious poem
 vah simit samay kii kavita hogi, kyonki use bhavishya main jhande nahin gaadna hoga
 Many levels of expression are possible in "and" avaita
 bhashaa or kathy main vah patibaddh nahin he, isliye 'flexbal' he
 It has complex and 'tipsy' processes - straight and broken things
 " akavita ke pravaktaa kavi ne yah bhi ullekh kiya he ki "akavita ke liye nayi kavita yaa navagit virodh yogya nahin hai
 People of the movement instinctively call it a faction or conspiracy
 " Akvita's movement was also accused of being associated with the Beatnik movement

 unhone 'taaji kavita' kaa andolan isliye chalaaya ki nayi kavita main ab kuch 'nayaapan' bhi shesh na rah gaya tha or vah ek khaas rup main pratishthit bhi ho chuki thi
 Varma ji also said that "much of the new poem was indirectly taken up by Naibhinal taking the vitality from the shadows
