 Some prehistoric mangroves belong to one anthropological race or two different races, Karl Pearson first used statistics to solve this intractable question of anthropology
 manovigyaan or shiksha ke kshetra main vyavsaayik prashikshan ke liye, maanav mastishk kaa adhyayan karte samay, buddhi, vishesh yogyata or abhiruchi aadi ke sandarbh main sankhyikeey takneekee kii sahaayta lee jaati he
 Both statistical data and methods are very useful in the field of medicine

 Astrology, insurance and meteorology are other areas of advantageous tips in statistics
 sankhyikee kaa prayog yadakada sahitya main bhi hua he
 Until recently, there was a belief that there is no need for statistics in physics, chemistry and engineering
 in yatharth vigyaanon main sankhyikeey siddhanton ke prayog se sachmuch bahut badi kranti hui he
 Statistical property control, which is an adaptation of statistical methods under production engineering, is the result of this revolution
 baadh niyantran, sadak suraksha, telephone, yatayaat aadi kii samasyaon main sankhyikeey pranaaliyon kaa prayog safal rahaa he
 In future, even more widespread spread of statistics is possible
 kuch vishyon ke liye yah moulik mahatv ke vichaar or kuch ke liye anusandhan kii shaktishaalee vidhiyaan, pradaan karti he
 It can be said that statistics are becoming ubiquitous without fear of subject denial
 sankhyikeey anusandhan pariyojna ke liye chaanbin karne kaa saajha dhyey he aapad or visheshtya bhavishyavaktaaon ke mulyon main parivartan, athwa swatantra charon kaa anukriya athwa ashrith charon par kya prabhaav padataa he, iske bare main nishkarsh nikaalnaa
aniyat sankhyikeey adhyayan ke do pramukh prakaar hai, prayogtmak adhyayan or avlokan adhyayan
adhyayan ke donon prakaar main, ek swatantra char ke matbhedon kaa, ek ashrith char ke vyavhaar par asar kaa avlokan kiya jaataa he
 The difference between the two types lies in how the actual study is conducted
 nihit he
 Anybody can be very effective
 ek prayogtmak adhyayan main sammilit he, iske antargat kii pranali kaa maap, is pranali se chhedchhad or usee prakriya kaa prayog kar, atirikt maap lenaa, yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye kii kya pranali se chhedchhad ne maap ke mulyon main sanshodhan kiya haiske vipareet, ek paryvekshaniya adhyayan main prayogtmak herpher shaamil nahin he
 Instead, data is collected and the correlation between prophets and feedback is examined
 ek praayogic adhyayan kaa ek udhaaharan he prasiddh howthorn prabhaav, jisane pashchimi electric company ke howthorn sanyantr main kaary parivesh ko badalane kaa prayaas kiya
 Researchers wanted to know whether the increase in lights would increase the productivity of workers on the assembly line

yah ullekhneey he ki vastav main, utpaadakta behatar nikali
 
 ) haalanki, is adhyayan kii aaj, prayogtmak prakriyaaon main trutiyon ke liye aalochana kii jaati he, vishesh rup se, niyantran samooh kii kami or andhepan ke kaaran
 An example is an observational study that explores the correlation between smoking and lung cancer
 is prakaar ke adhyayan main aam taur par, ek surveykshan kii madad se, jis kshetra main dilchaspee ho, uske aankadon ko ikaitha kar, unka sankhyikeey vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 In this case, researchers would have collected data on both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a case-control study, and then finding the number of lung cancer cases in each group
 ek prayog ke buniyadi kadam hai; Some known statistical tests and procedures for research observation are: jaanch ke kuch kshetron main vyavhaarik sankhyikee kaa upyog itnaa vyapak he ki unki ek vishisht shabdaawalee he
 These topics include: aankadon ke saath vyapaar main ek mahatvapurn aadhaar upkaran or vinirmaan farm kaa
iskaa upyog maap system parivartaneeyata ko samajhane, niyantran prakriyaaon main athwa es pi si), data kaa saransh dikhne, tathaa data-sanchalit nirnay lene ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It is a major instrument in these roles and perhaps the only reliable instrument
 yah ek aam dharna he ki prastutakarta sankhyikeey gyaan ke durupyog ke liye, zyaadaatar or jaanboojh kar, aise raste dhundte hai, jinase keval un aankadon kii vyakhya karen, jo unke laabh ke anuroop he benjamin disaraili dwaara di ek prasiddh kahawat he, " jhooth teen prakaar ke hote hai: jhooth, shaapit, jhooth or aankade "; or harvard ke pramukh laurence lowell ne san 1909 main likhaa tha ki aankade, vil paais kii tarah tab tak thik hai jab tak aap us vyakti ko jaanate hon jisane unhen banaaya tha, tathaa unke avyavon ke bare main santusht hai
 
 yadi vibhinn adhyayan ek duusare kaa khandan karte hon, tab aam janata kaa aise adhyayanon par se vishwaas uth saktaa he
 For example, one study showed that a diet or activity raised blood pressure, while another study suggested that they lower blood pressure
 aisi visangatiyaan prayogtmak dizin main maamuli her-pher dwaara uth sakati hai, jaise rogi samoohon, yaa anusandhan protocol ke vah matbhed, jo aasaani se gaiyr visheshgyon dwaara samajhe naa ja saken
 By selecting a certain sample, the result can be manipulated
 jaruri nahin ki is tarah kaa jodtod durbhaavnapurna athwa kutiltapurna ho; yah shodhakarta ke anbhipret pakshpaat se utpann ho saktaa he
 Graphs summarizing data can also be misleading
 is tathy kii gahan aalochana hui he ki pariklpana pareekshan kaa vah drushtikon, jiskaa vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he or jo kai maamalon main kanoon yaa vinium ke dwaara aavashyak he, ek pariklpana ) kii "tarafdaari" karata he or yah ek bade adhyayan main, kisi maamuli antar ke mahatva ko bhi badha-chadhaa kar dikhaa saktaa he
 a difference that is of high statistical significance may still be of no practical significance

 The flow of ocean water in a continuous and directed direction is called ocean current
 vastutah mahasagariya dharaaen, mahasaagaron ke andar bahane vaali ushn yaa sheethal nadiyaan hai
 It is often mistaken that water in the oceans remains constant, but in reality it does not happen

 The major drainage stream and stream current are in the natural stream

 ucch daab ke kshetra evam thandi mahasagariya jal dharaaen hi ve prakritik ghatnaayen hai, jinaki kriyaaon ke falswaroop saikadon varshon ke baad registan banate hai
 There are mainly three reasons for the formation of ocean currents - first, the amount of salt in the water changes from one place to another, so the density of ocean water also changes with the location
 dravyon kii prakritik pravriti jisamen ve adhik ghanatv vaale kshetra kii ore agrasar hote hai, ke kaaran dharaaen banati hai
 In the second reason, the rays of the sun do not fall on the surface of the water
 is kaaran jal ke taapmaana main asamanta aa jaati he
 This creates convection currents
 teesraa kaaran sagar kii sataha ke upar bahane vaali tej hawaaen hoti hai
 They also have the ability to produce waves in water

 Knowledge of surface ocean currents can help control expenditure on shipping to a large extent
 inke kaaran hi eendhan kii khapat par bada prabhaav padataa he, jo vyay or yatra samay main kaaphi kami laata he
 In the olden times, knowledge of ocean currents and wind direction was even more important

45 Iniyar Begusarai is a village in Begusarai, Bihar
 yah singhaasana battisi kii unnisvin putali thi
 The story narrated by him to Raja Bhoj is as follows
 raja vikramaditya ke darbar main log apni samasyaayen lekar nyaay ke liye to aate hi the kabhi-kabhi un prashnon ko lekar bhi upasthit hote the jinka koi samaadhaan unhen nahin sujhata tha
 Vikram used to find such an exact solution to those questions that the questioner would get satisfied completely
 aise hi ek tede prashn ko lekar ek din do tapasvi darbar main aae or unhone vikram so apane prashn kaa uttar dene kii vinati kii
 One of them believed that the mind of man controls all his activities and man can never do anything against his mind
 doosraa uske mat se sahamat nahin tha
 He said that man's knowledge controls all his activities
 man bhi gyaan kaa das he or vah bhi gyaan dwaara die gaye nirdeshon kaa paalan karne ko baadhya he
 King Vikramaditya listened carefully to the subject of their dispute, but was not able to give his decision on that subject immediately
 unhone un donon tapasviyon ko kuch samay baad aane ko kaha
 When he left, Vikram started thinking about his question, which was really very crooked
 unhone ek pal sochaa ki manushya kaa man sachmuch bahut chanchal hota he or uske vasheebhoot hokar manushya sansaarik vaasana ke adheen ho jaataa he
 But the second moment he remembered knowledge
 unhen laga ki gyaan sachmuch manushya ko man kaa kaha karne se pehle vichaar kar lene ko kahata he or kisi nirnay ke liye prerit karata he
 Vikram used to find answers to such complicated questions in the life of ordinary people, so he changed into an ordinary citizen and left his kingdom
 unhen kai dinon tak aisi koi baat dekhne ko nahin mili jo prashn ko hal karne main sahaayta karti
 One day, he noticed a young man whose clothes and expressions reflected his disharmony
 vah ek ped ke neeche thakkar aaraam kar rahaa tha
 Beside a bullock cart he used to coach
 raja ne uske nikat jaakar dekha to ve use ek jhalak main hi pahchaan gaye
 He was the younger son of his integral friend, Seth Gopal Das
 seth gopal das bahut bade vyapaaree the or unhone vyapaar se bahut dhan kamaaya tha
 His curiosity was aggravated by his son's plight
 uski badahaali kaa kaaran jaanane ko utsuk ho gayi
 They asked him how his condition happened while Gopal Das, while dying, shared all his wealth and business equally among his two sons
 ek ke hisse kaa dhan itnaa tha ki do pushton tak aaraam se zindagi guzaari ja sakati thi
 Vikram then expressed his curiosity to know about his brother as well
 yuvak samaj gaya ki poochne vaala sachmuch uske parivaar ke bare main sari jaankaree rakhata he
 He told Vikram everything about himself and his brother
 usne bataaya ki jab uske pita ne uske or uske bhai ke bich sab kuch baant diya to uske bhai ne apane hisse ke dhan kaa upyog bade hi samajhadaari se kiya
 He limited his needs and invested all his money in the business, and by working day and night, he increased his business manifold
 apane budhimaan or sanyamee bhai se usne koi prerana nahin lee or apane hisse main mili apaar dhan ko dekhakar ghamand se chur ho gaye
 Made all the bad habits including alcoholism, gambling and gambling
 ye sari aadaten uske dhan ke bhandar ke tezi se khokhla karne lageen
 The elder brother told him to go to Chet in time, but his words appeared to him like poison
 ye buree aadaten use bahut tezi se barabaadi kii taraf le gayi or ek varsh ke andar vah kangaal ho gaya
 He was the son of a wealthy and respected Seth of his city, so everyone began to ridicule his plight
 idhar bhukhon marane kii naubat, udhar shame se munh chupaane kii jagah nahi
 His life became difficult
 apane nagar main majdoor kii haisiyat se guzaaraa karnaa use asambhav laga to vahaan se dur chalaa aayaa
 After working hard, he fills his stomach and thinks of doing something for his future also
 dhan jab uske paas prachur maatra main tha to man kii chanchalta par vah ankush nahin laga sakaa
 When the money wasted, he got goodwill and after stumbling he realized his mistake
 jab raja ne poocha kya vah dhan aane par phir se man kaa kaha karegaa to usne kaha ki jamaane kii thokaron ne use sachcha gyaan de diya he or ab us gyaan ke bal par vah apane man ko vash main rakh saktaa he
 Vikram then went and gave him his true introduction and advised him to trade smartly by giving him many gold currencies
 unhone use bharosa dilaayaa ki lagn sheeltaa use phir pehle vaali samruddhi waapas dilaa degi
 With goodbye to him, he returned to his palace as he now had a solution to the dispute of those ascetics
 kuch samay baad unke darbar main ve donon tapasvi samaadhaan kii ichha liye haazir hue
 Vikram told them that man's body tries to control his mind again and again, but on the basis of knowledge, a rational man does not allow the mind to dominate himself
 man or gyaan main anyonashray sambandh he tathaa donon kaa apana-apana mahatv he
 The apocalypse of someone who completely falls under his mind is inevitable
 man agar rath he to gyaan sarathi
 The charioteer is incomplete without charioteer
 unhone seth putr ke saath jo kuch gata tha unhen vistaarpurvak bataaya to unke man main koi sanshay nahin rahaa
 Those ascetics gave him a miraculous chalice from which the pictures made could come alive at night and their conversation could also be heard
 vikram ne kuch tasviren banaakar khadiya kii satyata jaanane kii koshish kii to sachmuch khadiya main vah gun tha
 Now Raja started making up his mind by making pictures
 apni raniyon kii unhen bilkul sudhi nahin rahi
 When the queens came to him after several days, the king saw Kharia drawing a picture
 raniyon ne aakar unka dhyaan bantaya to raja ko hansee aa gai or unhone kaha ve bhi man ke aadhin ho gaye the
 Now, he knows about his responsibilities

 In short, it is concerned with the use of the study of linguistics in applied fields
 bhashavigyaan kaa sarvaadhik upyog bhashashikshan ke kshetra main kiya ja rahaa he

 Vocabulary study has great utility in constructing the systematic method of Ashu script
 tiperiter ke keyboard kii kram-vyavastha main bhi bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 In today's era, the importance of linguistics is also increasing because its use is proving very beneficial in the field of automatic or mechanical translation in addition to linguistics

 After some time in one of his friends' house, he is found as "bhagavad-gita - a sacred Hindu text" translating "gita" and commentary with ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
 1971 main, landan main pehle se hi ja rahaa he, paul vaishnav mandir kii yatra kaa faisla kiya
 Vidshukavshy him, he stood in front of the door, wondering whether or not to go
 At this time the temple came to Vaishnavas, dressed him in garlands of flowers and invited him to breakfast
 Then Paul removed the Vaishnav road, which he actually walked with the likes

 nilgiri ke kai arth ho sakate hai:- Polarization is the property of transverse waves that is related to the direction of their oscillations
 dhruv kaa arth he 'nishchit'
 The polarized wave has oscillations in a finite form whereas the polarized wave has equal oscillations in all directions
 kisi gas yaa drav main gatiman dhwani tarangen dhruvan kaa gun pradarshit nahin karatin kyonki unki gati kii disha or dolan kii disha ek hi hoti he
 The beam of ordinary light is symmetric relative to the transmission direction, but in special cases it is characterized by asymmetry or unilaterality
 yah baat tourmaileen naamak hare rang ke prakritik crystal kii pattica ke dwaara aasaani se pramanit ho sakati he
 When ordinary light passes through this plate, the intensity of the beam does not change when the fillet rotates on the axis of the beam, but when this beam coming out of the terramine, rotating the second plate of the tourmaline, the intensity of the beam There is a lot of change in
 jab donon tourmailinon ke aksh samaantar hote hai tab to tivrata adhiktam hoti he
 As the angle between these axes increases, the intensity decreases and when it becomes equal to the right angle, the intensity value becomes zero
 spasht he ki pratham tourmaileen main se nikalne par prakaash main asamamiti kaa aisa gun utpann ho gaya he jo saadhaaran prakaash main nahin tha
 The name of this property is "dhruvana" and this quality of light is called "dhruvit"
 is drushti se saadhaaran prakaash "adhruvit" kehalaata he
 Through the phenomena of interference and diffraction, it becomes clear that just like sound, the transmission of light is in the form of waves and a material called ether has been conceived as the medium for this transmission
 dhruvan kii uparyukt ghatana yah pramanit karti he ki prakashtarangen dhwanitarangon ke samaan anudairdhya nahin hoti, kyonki anudairthay tarangon main kampan sancharan kii disha main hone ke kaaran uparyukt prakaar kii asamamiti sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, light waves are transverse, ie their vibrations are in the right-angled direction from waves like vibrations of the star's wire
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki anuprastha tarang main madhyam ke kan kaa kampanpath saral rekhaatmak hi ho
 It is necessary that the vibrational path is located in a plane on which the direction of wave propagation is normal
 at: is kampanpath kii akruti dirghavrittakar tathaa vishesh avasthaaon main vrittakar bhi ho sakati he
 The wave in which the shape of the vibration and if the vibration is simple linear, its direction is unchanged, it is called polar wave and in which this shape or direction keeps changing, it is called inverted
 is drushti se dhruvit prakaash nimnlikhit teen prakaar kaa ho saktaa he : 1
 level polarized 2
 dirghavritt dhruvit 3
 Circle Polarized
 ganitiya adhyayan se vidit he ki companon kii ye vibhinn akritiyaan, do samakonik saral aavart companon ke sangyojan se praapt hoti hai
 Conversely, whatever the shape of the vibration is, the decomposition of it can yield two right-angled simple periodic vibrations
 jab prakashtarang kisi paardarshee crystal main pravesh karti he, tab uske companon kaa aisa vighatan pratyaksht: ho jaataa he or do samtal dhruvit kirane crystal main prakat ho jaati hai
 Their vibrations are right-angled
 saamanyat: ye bhinn dishaao main gaman karti hai or unke veg baraabar nahin hote
 This phenomenon is called bivariation and by this, Heisenz invented polarization in 1960
 tourmaileen ke crystal main in do kirnon main se ek kaa avasorana ho jaataa he
 This is the reason for the origin of light polarized by Tourmaline
 is prakaash ke companon kii disha tourmaileen pattica ke crystalia aksh kii disha par nirbhar karti he or us pattica ko ghumaane se companon kii disha bhi badal jaati hai
 But the shape or direction of vibrations in ordinary superfluous light varies continuously from moment to moment, so when it comes out of the tourmaline, the intensity of the polar light also changes but its average value is equal in each position of the tourmaline
 And this is what we see
 kintu jab samtal dhruvit prakaash, jiskaa aayam he, tourmaileen main se hokar nikalataa he tab vah dhruvit to rahata he, parantu uskaa aayam ghatakar ho jaataa he, jahaan tourmaileen kii sthiti kaa suchak kone he
 q = 0 is considered when the amplitude is greatest
 ko q = 90 degree hone par aayam a = 0 ho jaataa he or pargamit prakaash kaa lop ho jaataa he, chaahe aaptit prakaash ke aayam kaa maan kitna hi bada kyon na ho
 The ellipse also polarizes the polarized light to the tourmaline plane, and its intensity also increases by rotating the tourmaline, but it never completely disappears
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke aaptit prakaash main paraspar samakonik, kintu bhinn ayaamon vaale do avyav kampan hote hai or jab q = 0 kii sthiti main ek avyav kaa aayam mahattam hota he tab duusare kaa lop ho jaataa he or q = 90 degree hone par pehle aayam kaa lop hota he or doosraa aayam mahattam ho jaataa he
 Tourmaline cannot change the intensity of polar-polarized light, because its two components vibrations have equal dimensions, ie
 at: isamen bhi adhruvit prakaash kii hi tarah samamiti kaa gun hota he
 Yet it is polarized light
 isko pahchaanane kii yukti aage bataai jaaegi
 The vibrations are simple in line and their direction is constant
 at: ise rekha dhruvit bhi kehete hai
 The reason for the name of the polar plane is that the vibrations of all the points of such a ray of light are in the same plane
 samtal dhruvit prakaash utpann karne ke anya upaay nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Diffusion occurs in crystals such as nickel prism - calcite, but the two mutually flat plane rays are so close that only one of them is difficult to obtain
 kintu kailcite ke visheshu yukti se kaate hue do prismon ko canada baalsam se jodakar ek samaantar falki prism bana liya jaataa he, jise nikal prism kehete hai
 Upon entering Canada, on reaching Balsam, a ray is completely reflected and goes to the lateral and is destroyed there, but the second ray goes straight out
 yah prism acha paardarshee hota he
 Thus, the flat, polar light obtained from it is the color of incident light
 2
 polaroid - isamen herapathite naamak khanij ke sookshm crystalon ko vishesh yukti se saloloid ke do takhton ke bich main is prakaar samaantar sthiti main jamaa diya jaataa he jisase ve sab milakar ek lambey chaude crystal kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 This produces flat polarized light, similar to tourmaline

 paravartan - san 1810 main malus ne pramanit kiya tha ki jal yaa kaach jaise kisi paardarshee padaarth ke prishth se paravartit prakaash main dhruvan kaa gun anshat: paaya jaataa he or aapatan kone vishesh maan kaa hone par vah purnat: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he
 This incidence angle is called the "polar angle"
 brooster ke niyamanusaar yadi dhruvak kone i ho tathaa paravartak padaarth kaa vartanaank m ho to sp hota he
 4
 Filletganj - Although the reflected light at the polar angle is completely polarized by the fillet of the slab, the light transmitted from it is never fully polarized, it is only partially polarized, but the light transmitted from among several plaques progressively
 The polarization increases progressively and when the number of plaques becomes sufficient, it becomes almost completely flat
 patali patali kai patticoon ke aise samooh ko pattikapunj kehete hai
 5
 Scattering - When light falls on very small particles present in a transparent medium, then the light circulating around them is also normally fractionated
 kintu jo prakaash praathmik kiran se samakonik disha main prakirnit hota he, vah purnat: samtal dhruvit hota he
 This can be seen in the blue light of the sky, which is only the sunlight transmitted by the molecules of air
 jis prakaar yah maaloom karne ke liye ki koi prakaash samtal dhruvit he yaa nahin or yadi he to uskaa dhruvanatal koun-sa he, tourmaileen kaa upyog hota he, thik usee tarah dhruvan utpann karne ke uparyukt sabhi sadhano kaa upyog bhi is kaary ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The solution to produce this is that flat polarized light is injected onto a bipartite crystal, such as a mica plate, on a regular basis
 isse do bhinn ayaamon vaali samakonat: dhruvit kirane bhinn vegon se ek hi maarg par crystal main chalati hai
 On exiting from it, some time is generated in these two rays and by combining the two, ellipse polarized light is obtained
 yadi crystal pattica kii motaai itani ho ki kalantar 90 degree ho jaae to us pattica ko chaturthaansh tarangapattica kehete hai
 Rotating this fillet increases the amplitude of one beam and decreases the other
 jis sthiti main donon aayam baraabar ho jate hai, usamen pargamit prakaash vruttadhruvit ho jaataa he
 a quadrant wavelet is also used to identify such polarities
 yah ddeerghaavritiya athwa vrittiya companon kaa pun: do samakonik saral rekhaatmak companon main vighatan kar detaa he or pattica ko ghumaque yathochit sthiti main laane se vah unke kalantar ko gata yaa badhaakar 0 degree yaa 180 degree kar detaa he
 Therefore, the transmitted light becomes flat again polarized, which can be identified by tourmaline or nickel
 anshadhruvit athwa adhruvit prakaash se is kriya dwaara samtal dhruvit prakaash praapt nahin ho saktaa, kyonki anshadhruvit prakaash adhruvi tathaa samtal dhruvit prakaash kaa mishran hota he or adhruvit prakaash kaa tourmaileen dwaar lop kabhi bhi nahin ho saktaa
 Having knowledge of the direction of vibrations in plane polarized light, a polar plane was conceived and defined as: The polar plane is the import plane of a perfectly flat polar beam obtained by reflection
 at: tourmaileen kii jis sthiti main is paravartit kiran kii tivrata nasht ho jaati he usamen tourmaileen pattica par apaat tal se samaantar rekha khinch lee jaati he
 a parallel line is drawn from the emergency floor on the tourmaline plate and then the polar surface of any polarized light can be seen from such tourmaline
 ise jaanane ke liye saralatam yukti yah he ki kisi andhere kamare main samtal dhruvit prakaash kii patali kiran urdhwadhar disha main chalaai jaae
 The path of the ray will remain invisible, but if the smoke of very thin particles is generated near this ray by burning the paper, the path of the beam will be visible due to the light transmitted from those particles
 kintu chaaron ore ghumkar dekhne se kisi ek dishavishesh main kiran adrishy hi rahegi
 Apparently scattering does not occur in this direction
 at: yahi kampan kii disha he, kyonki kampan kii disha main anuprastha tarang nahin chal sakati
 By this measure it has been known that the direction of vibration is right-angled from the polar plane, ie the vibrations of the reflected beam at the polar angle are right-angled from the emergency plane
 yahi baat anya upayon se bhi pramanit ho gai he
 According to the electromagnetic theory of light, each beam has both electromagnetic and magnetic vibrations, and they are also parasitic
 is siddhant se yah bhi prakat hota he ki dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash main vaidyut kampan apattal se samakonik hote hai
 Therefore, it results that the vibrations of light affecting the eyes are electrical, not magnetic
 dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash main companon ke apaat tal se samakonik hone kaa taatpary spashtat: yah he ki yadi apati kiran ke kampan apaat tal main hon, to uskaa paravartan dhruvak kone par bilkul hi nahin, hota
 Therefore, when the angle of incidence is equal to the polar angle, then the polar light in the emergency can be reflected, but the emergency cannot reflect the polar light at right angles
 jyotimaapan main is baat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki prakaash kii tivrata ko icchaanusaar ghataya ja sake or yah bhi ham yatharthatapurvak jaan saken ki is ghati purv tivrata main or purvavarti tivrata main kya anupaat he
 Two nickel prisms are used for this
 jab donon samaantar avasth main hote hai, tab to uttarottar donon main hokar nikalanevaale prakaash kii tivrata mahattam hoti hai, kintu yadi donon kii sthitiyon ke bich main kone ho to tivrata ke anupaat main ghat jaati he
 Polaroid can also be used for this purpose

 But through research it is found that there are many such harmful yogis in cow urine
 Due to the harmful elements that are found on the body, due to the harmful elements, there are cells of our lungs, heart and nervous system that have a very bad effect due to which people also die, so RSS people in India come together here
 The illiterate and straightforward naïve bhali want to make people sleep in death by telling people about the sanctity of cow urine, consuming it in a blind faith
 Not, While some toxic elements are found inside the urine which cause disease in the body and some elements found in urine are neutralizing the toxic found in the body, then it is advisable to use them, otherwise in the case of On the body of an ordinary man, Gomutra only and only affects the bad, based on research conducted in Nigeria, it has been proved that the composition of cow urine Cic is a compound known as CUC, harmful toxic elements are found in CUC, due to which the brain of the urine consuming person has a very bad effect on their memory and reasoning ability and only in a few days
 They die In the case of otherwise, the cow urine only affects the body of an ordinary male and based on the research conducted in Nigeria, it has been proved that the composition of urine contains toxic compounds which are known as CUC, harmful toxic elements in CUC
 Due to which, people who consume cow urine have a very bad effect on their mind and their ability to reason and reason

show full citationabstracta review of current information on the composition, pharmacological actions and mode of death from cow's urine concoction toxicity is presented
 The concoction is prepared from leaves of tobacco, garlic and basil; lemon juice, rock salt and bulbs of onion
 The latter items are soaked in the urine from cows which acts as the vehicle in which the active principles in these constituents dissolve
 Over fifty chemical compounds have been identified in CUC
 The major compounds it contains are benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, p-cresol, thymol and nicotine
 The chemical composition and pharmacological cations of the individual components of CUC are also reviewed
 Observations of CUC poisoning in man and experimental animals showed that the main effects of CUC are severe depression of respiration, cardiovascular system, the central nervous system and hypoglycaemia
 These toxic effects acting singly or in combination are believed to be the cause of death from CUC
 Management is geared towards correcting these adverse effects

 Vemapathi Chinna Satyam added several dance dramas to it and created the dance structure of several solo performances and thus broadened the horizon of the dance form

 The dance is performed in a special traditional way

 His father's name was Jaitrasingh
 ye itihaas main ‘‘hathi hammir ke naam se prasiddh hue hai
 When Hammir became the ruler of Ranthambore in 1339, a new chapter in the history of Ranthambore begins
 hammir dev ranthambhore ke chouhaan vansh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee evam mahatvapurn shaasha the
 He established a vast empire with his muscle power

 They have become famous in history as "hathi Hammir"
 jab hammir visan 1339 main ranthambhore ke shaasha bane tab ranthambhore ke itihaas kaa ek nayaa adhyay prarambh hota he
 Hammir Dev was the most powerful and important ruler of the Chauhan dynasty of Ranthambore
 inhone apane baahubal se vishaal samrajya sthapit kar liya tha
 Jalaluddin Khilji attacked Ranthambore in 1347 AD
 sabase pehle usne chhangarh par akraman kiya
 The Muslim army took control of this fort after strong resistance
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore par akraman karne ke liye aage badi
 He attacked to take over the fort, but the Chauhan heroes, led by Hammir Dev, did so much harm to the Sultan, that he was forced to return to Delhi
 chhangarh par bhi chouhanon ne dubaara adhikaar kar liya
 Two years after this attack, the Muslim army invaded Ranthambore again, but they were defeated this time and returned to Delhi
 visan 1353 main sultan jilaluddin khilji kii hatya karke allaudin khilji dilli kaa sultan bana
 He aspired to bring the whole of India under his rule
 hammir ke netritv main ranthambhore ke chouhanon ne apni shakti ko kaaphi sudrudh bana liya or rajasthan ke vistrut bhubhag par apana shashan sthapit kar liya tha
 Alauddin Khilji did not want to see the increasing power of the Chauhans near Delhi, so a struggle was inevitable
 i

 1299 main allaudin kii sena ne gujarat par akraman kiya tha
 They were bringing a lot of loot money from there to Delhi
 maarg main lut ke dhan ke bantwaare ko lekar kuch senanayakon ne vidroh kar diya tathaa ve vidrohi senanayake raav hammirdev kii sharan main ranthambhore chale gaye
 These commanders were Mir Muhammad Shah and Kamru
 sultan allaudin ne in vidrohiyon ko saunp dene kii maang raav hammir se kii, hammir ne uski yah maang thukraa di
 Rao Hammir, following the principles of Kshatriya religion, did not return the soldiers who came to the asylum
 sharan main aae hue kii raksha karnaa apana karttavya samajha
 Alauddin got angry on this and prepared to battle Ranthambore
 allaudin kii sena ne sarvapratham chhangarh par akraman kiya
 He easily got here
 chhangarh par musalamaanon ne adhikaar kar liya he, yah samachar sunakar hammir ne ranthambhore se sena bheji
 The Chauhan army defeated the Muslim soldiers
 muslim sena parajeet hokar bhaag gai, chouhanon ne unka lutaa hua dhan va astr-shastr lut liye
 In 1358 AD, Alauddin Khilji again attacked the Chauhans
 chhangarh main donon senaaon main bhayankar yuddh hua
 In this war, Hammir himself did not go to war
 vir chouhanon ne veertapurvak yuddh kiya lekin vishaal muslim sena ke saamne kab tak tikte
 In the end, the Sultan gained control over Chhangarh
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore kii taraf badhane lagi
 The Turkish generals sent information to Hamir Dev, to hand us over to our rebels, whom you have given shelter to
 hamaari sena vaapis dilli laut jaaegi
 But Hammir was firm on his word
 usne sharnaagaton ko saunpane athwa apane rajya se nirvasit karne se spasht manaa kar diya
 The Turkish army laid siege to Ranthambore
 turki sena ne nusrat khan or ulug khan ke netritv main ranthambhore par akraman kiya
 Due to the fort being on a very high mountain, it was very difficult for the enemy to reach it
 muslim sena ne gheraa kada karte hue akraman kiya lekin durg rakshak un par pattharon, baanon kii bauchhaar karte, jisase unki sena kaa kaaphi nuksaan hota tha
 This kind of encirclement of the Muslim army continued for many days
 lekin unka ranthambhore par adhikaar nahin ho sakaa
 Alauddin again sent messengers to Rao Hammir to hand over the rebel soldiers, our army would return to Delhi
 hammir hath purvak apane vachan par drudh tha
 For a long time the circle of the Muslim army continued and the Chauhan army kept on fighting
 allaudin ko ranthambheer par adhikaar karnaa mushkil lag rahaa tha
 He resorted to deceit
 hammir ke paas sandhi kaa prastaav bheja jisko paakar hammir ne apane aadmi sultan ke paas bheje
 Among those men, there was a Surjan Kothari and some crying heroes
 allaudin ne unako lobh laalach dekar apni taraf milaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Some of these secretly turned to the Sultan
 durg kaa dheraa bahut dinon se chal rahaa tha, jisase durg main rasad aadi kii kami ho gai
 The fortress now considered the final decisive war
 rajputon ne kesharia vastra dhaaran karke shaakaa kiya
 The Rajput army opened the fort's doors
 bheeshan yuddh karnaa prarambh kiya
 There was a face-to-face battle on both sides
 ek ore sankhya bal main bahut kam rajput the to duusari ore sultan kii kai guna bady sena, jinke paas paryeti yuddhadi saamagree evam rasad thi
 In front of the might of the Rajputs, the Muslim soldiers could not stand, they ran away leaving the flags of the Muslim soldiers, the Rajputs snatched and the Rajput army returned to the fort
 durg par se raniyon ne musalamaanon ke jhando ko durge kii ore aate dekhakar samajha kii rajput haar gaye atah unhone johar kar apane aapako agni ko samarpit kar diya
 On entering the fort, seeing the flames of Jauhar, Hamir realized his mistake
 usne praayshchit karne hetu kile main sthit shiv mandir par apana mastak kaat kar shankar bhagwaan ke shivlinga par chadhaa diya
 When Alauddin came to know about this incident, he returned and captured the fort
 yah pankti hammir mahakavy main hammir dev chouhan ke bare main likhi gai he is pankti kaa taatpary he ki rajasthan ke ranthambhore samrajya kaa maharaja hammir dev chouhan singh ke samaan gujarata tha arthath usne kabhi chhupakar muqabla nahin kiya wo sher kii bhanti raaj karata tha
 The promise of the word means that King Hammir considered it his first duty to fulfill the promise given to him, and in the same way that the fruit of the tree grows once the tree, similarly the anger was satisfied only when King Hammir got victory over anger
 
 triya arthath aurat ko shaadi ke vakt ek baar hi tel chadhaane kii rasm hoti he usee prakaar hammir bhi kisi kaary ko baar baar dohraane kii bajaae ek hi baar main puraa karnaa mahatv purna samajhataa tha arthath raja hammir dev chouhan kaa hath uski nidarta kaa pratik rahaa he
 He was the only Chauhan ruler who considered independent rule to be his pride and this self-respect of Hammir Dev Chauhan was heartening to Maharana Pratap and Pratap did not accept the Mughal ruler Akbar's lifetime suzerainty

 The creation of both the Hammir epic and Prabandhak epics were contemporaries of Hammir Dev, Dasharatha Sharma accepted the coronation of Hammir Dev between 1339 and 1343 and his father Jaitrasinh handled Hammir Dev as a vast empire of the Ranthambore empire
 But Hammir Dev Chauhan's ambitious ruler was not satisfied with this empire

 The name of the beloved horse of Maharaja Hammir Dev Chauhan was Badal, the name of the queen of Hammir Dev Chauhan was Rangadevi and the name of her daughter was Padmala, which was very dear to Hammir Dev

 Nayanchandra Suri has also briefly described Jaitrasinh and the earlier Ranthambore rulers in this epic

 According to Hammir Rasou, the Ranthambore Empire extended Hammir Dev from Ujjain to Mathura and from Malwa to Arbudachal
 hammir rasau se gyaat hota he ki hammir dev ujjain ko jitkar mahakaleshwar jyotirling main shiv kii puja kii thi evam ajmer ko jitkar pushkar main shahi snaan kiya tha
 Some verses of Hammir Rasou are intended: - kab hath kare alaudi, rantabhanvar garh aahi
 Kabhai Sekh Sarnai is staying, Bahimah Mahim Sahi
 
 Let me think in your mind, the title is not fermented
 jo hath chando raav tum, ut na lajai ajmeri
 
 saran rakhi sekh na tajau, tajau sis garh des
 To Rani Rao Hammir, this Dinhou Upades
