 Where appropriate type of water is available in the required quantity, the water required by machines is easily supplied
 taaja jal nagarpalikaon ke jalaashyon se mil jaataa he, kintu is jal ke jeevanuon ko maarane ke liye prayukt chlorin gas ke avshesh ko pehle alag kar liya jaataa he, kyonki yah gas jalashay ke jeevon ko haani pahunchaati he
 If sea water is necessary for the reservoir, then take water from a place in the sea where there is no dirt coming from the rivers, or falling otherwise
 aise sthanon par bhi tufaanon ke kaaran jal upyog ke ayogy thahar saktaa he, isaliye anek jagahon par aisa prabandh rahata he ki hauj main ek baar bharaa hua jal pun: sanchaarit hota rahata he or maarg main uske chaanane or upyukt banane kii kriyaayein sampann ho jaati hai

 The feces etc
 which come out of the body of fish and other organisms are used as manure for the vegetation and thus the dirt does not get collected in the water
 vanaspatiyon se jalashay kii sundarataa main bhi vriddhi hoti he
 The restoration of oxygen exploited by water by flora and fauna and the removal of carbon dioxide produced by them in water is necessary

 Fishes require very little food
 isaliye is bhul kii adhik sambhaavna he ki kam bhojan dene ke sthaan par aavashyaktaa se adhik bhojan diya jaay
 It is always important to keep in mind that as much food is consumed in the reservoir as it can consume

 Governments of almost all countries have made arrangements to maintain adequate fishes in public reservoirs, to keep fish in special fisheries, to conserve their eggs and to raise children
 jahaan sambhav hota he vahaan adon ko machhliyon se alag rakhkar sene or bachche paidaa karne kaa bhi prabandh rahata he
 In this way, any type of fish, small or big, needed to be released in rivers or reservoirs

 maharaja surajmal bharatpur rajya ke doordarshee ] the
 His father Badan Singh made Deeg his capital first and later Surajmal founded the city of Bharatpur
 surajmal ne san 1733 main khemkaran sogriyaa kii fatahgadhi par akraman kiya or vijay praapt kar yahan 1743 main bharatpur nagar kii neenv rakhi jo san 1753 se unka nivas hua
 Maharaja Suraj Mal was politically intelligent, visionary, handsome, shapely and healthy
 unhone jaipur ke maharaja jaisingh se bhi dosti bana lee thi
 Jaisingh died on 21 September 1743, and soon thereafter a fight ensued over his sons Ishwari Singh and Madhosingh

 In 1753, Maharaja Suraj Mal captured Firoz Shah Kotla
 dilli ke nawab gaji-ud-deen ne phir maraathon ko surajmal ke khilaaf bhadakaayaa or phir maraathon ne janvari 1754 se may 1754 tak bharatpur jile main surajmal ke kumher kile ko ghere rakhaa
 The Marathas could not capture the fort and in that battle, Khande Rao Holkar, son of Malhar Rao was killed

 mathura kii nabi masjid ko dekhakar bhaau ne gusse main kaha - surajmal ji, mathura itane din se aapke kabje main he, phir is masjid ko aapane kaise chhod diya? surajmal ne jawaab diya - agar mujhe yakeen hota ki main sari umr is ilaake kaa badshaah rahoonga to shaayad main is masjid ko girava detaa, par kya phayda? kal musalmaan aakar hamaare mandiron ko giravaayen or vahiin par masjiden banavaa den to aapako acha lagegaa? baad main phir bhaau ne laal kile ke diwane-khaas kii chat ko girwane kaa hukum diya tha, yah soch kar ki is sone ko bechakar apane sainikon kii tankhwaah de duungaa
 On this too Surajmal refused him, even said that take five lakh rupees from me, but do not break it, after all Nadir Shah had also spared this roof
 par bhaau nahin mana - jab chat kaa sona todaa gaya to vah mushkil se teen lakh rupee kaa niklaa
 Bhau did not listen to many things about Surajmal and also said that - i have not come here from far south on the strength of your strength
 14 janvari 1761 main panipat kii teesri ladaai maraathon or ahmedshah abdali ke bich hui
 More than half of the one lakh soldiers of the Marathas were killed
 maraathon ke paas na to puraa rashan tha or na hi is ilaake kaa unhen bhed tha, kai-kai din ke bhukhe sainik kya yuddh karte ? agar sadashiv raav maharaja surajmal se choti-si baat par takaraar na karke use bhi is jang main saajheedaar banaata, to aaj bharat kii tasviir or hi hoti| maharaja surajmal ne phir bhi dosti kaa haq adaa kiya
 When thirty-forty thousand Marathas started going back after the war, they had a bad condition while reaching the area of surajmal

 The term Internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably in everyday speech; When using a web browser to view web pages, it is common to speak of "going to the Internet"
 However, the World Wide Web or Web is one of only a large number of Internet services that collect web interconnected documents and other web resources

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role

 Such proposals survived into Roman times

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 However, this new approach was slow to take root in biological science, the last bastion of the concept of definite natural types

 The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still in view of species determined according to a divine plan
 is samay ke anya prakrutivaadee samay par prakritik kanoonon ke anusaar prajatiyon ke vikasvaadi parivartan par anumaan lagaate hai
 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians
 , Which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and was praised by Charles Darwin Did

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die

 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms

 Their separate papers were presented together at the 1858 meeting of the London Society of London

 Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide convincing evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry

 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 Hereditary traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype
 ek jeev kii sanrachana or vyavhaar ko banane vaale anokhi lakshanon kaa puraa set use fanotip kaha jaataa he yah lakshan paryaavaran ke saath apane ginotip ke sampark se aate hai
 As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited

 However, relatively small differences in genotype can also lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differentiate in about 5% of their genomes
 mukhya lekh: utparivartan Repeat mutation of part of a chromosome is a change in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome
 jab utparivartan hote hai, ve ek jin ke utpaada ko badal sakate hai, yaa jin ko kaary karne se roak sakate hai, yaa iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, it has been suggested that if a gene changes the protein produced by the gene, it will likely be harmful, with approximately 70% of these mutations having a harmful effect, and the remaining neutral or weak forms

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around
