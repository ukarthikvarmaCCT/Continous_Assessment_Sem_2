 mohammad rafi kaa janm 24 disambar 1924 ko amritsar, ke paas kotla sultan singh main hua tha
 His family moved from Lahore to Amritsar in the early childhood
 inke parivaar kaa sangeet se koi khaas sarokaar nahin tha
 When Rafi was younger, his elder brother had a barber shop, Rafi used to spend a lot of time there
 kaha jaataa he ki rafi jab saat saal ke the to ve apane bade bhai kii dukaan se hokar guzarane vaale ek fakir kaa peechha kiya karte the jo udhar se gaate hue jaaya karata tha
 Rafi liked his voice and Rafi used to imitate him
 unki nakal main awvalata ko dekhakar logon ko unki aawaaj bhi pasand aane lagi
 People started praising her songs in the barber shop
 lekin isse rafi ko sthaneey khyaati ke atirikt or kuch nahin mila
 His elder brother Mohammad Hameed noticed his interest in his music and asked him to take music education to Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan
 ek baar akashwani lahore main us samay ke prakhyat gayak-abhinayta kundan laal sahagal apana pradarshan karne aae the
 Mohammad Rafi and his elder brother also went to hear this
 bijli gul ho jane kii vajah se sahagal ne gane se manaa kar diya
 Rafi's elder brother requested the organizers that Mohammad Rafi should be given a chance to sing in order to calm the anxiety of the crowd
 unako anumati mil gai or 13 varsh kii aayu main mohammad rafi kaa ye pehla saarvajanik pradarshan tha
 Among the observers, Shyam Sundar, who was a famous musician of that time, also heard him and was impressed
 unhone mohammad rafi ko apane liye gane kaa nyauta diya
 Mohammed Rafi's first song was for a Punjabi film Gul Baloch which he sang in 1944 under the direction of Shyam Sundar
 san 1946 main mohammad rafi ne bombay aane kaa faisla kiya

 baiju baavaraa ke gaanon ne rafi ko mukhyadhara gayak ke rup main sthapit kiya
 Naushad then gave Rafi many songs to sing under his direction
 lagbhag isi samay sangeetkaar jodi shankar-jaykishan ko unki aawaaj pasand aayi or unhone bhi rafi se gane gavaana aarambh kiya
 Shankar Jaikishan was Raj Kapoor's favorite composer at the time, but Raj Kapoor liked Mukesh's voice only
 baad main jab shankar jaykishan ke gaanon kii maang badi to unhone lagbhag har jagah rafi sahab kaa prayog kiya
 Even Rafi Sahab sang for Raj Kapoor many times
 jald hi sangeetkaar sachin dev burman tathaa ullekhneey rup se o pi naiyyar ko rafi kii awaz bahut raas aayi or unhone rafi se gavaana aarambh kiya

 unke nirdesan main gaae gaano se rafi ko bahut khyaati mili or phir ravi, madan mohan, gulam haidar, jayadev, salil choudhary ityadi sangeetkaaron kii pehali pasand rafi sahab ban gaye
 After singing for artists such as Dilip Kumar, Bharat Bhushan and Devanand, the list of artists who performed on their songs increased
 shammi kapur, rajendra kumaar, joy mukherjee, vishwajit, rajesh khanna, dharmendra ityadi kalakaaron ke liye rafi kii aawaaj prishthbhumi main gunjane lagi
 Shammi Kapoor was so impressed with Rafi's voice that he used Rafi in each of his songs
 unke liye sangeet kabhi o pi naiyyar ne diya to kabhi shankar jaykishan ne par aawaaj rafi kii hi rahi
 Whether someone calls me Junglee, Ehsaan Tera Hoga Mujper Mein, Ye Chand Sa Roshan Face, Deewana Hua Badal is one of the popular songs filmed on top of Shammi Kapoor
 dhire-dhire inaki khyaati itani bad gayi ki abhinayta inhen se gaanaa gavaane kaa aagrah karne lage
 Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar and Dharmendra did not believe that any other singer would sing for them

 yah silsilaa 1960 ke dashak main bhi chalata rahaa

 1969 main shakti samant apni ek film aradhana kaa nirmaan karvaa rahe the jiske liye unhone sachin dev burman ko sangeetkaar chunaa
 In the same year, Dada fell ill and his son Rahul Dev Burman = Avrohan == The end of the decade was not pleasant for him after he reached the top of his career in the 1960s

 us samay rafi haj ke liye gaye hue the

 He married Begum Wikis and had seven children - four sons and three daughters
 mohammad rafi ko unke parmartho ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 He was very cheerful and generous and always ready to help everyone
 kai filmi geet unhonen bina paise liye yaa behad kam paison lekar gaaye
 In his early days, he sang for the composer duo laxmikant-pyarelal for very little money
 gaanon kii roylty ko lekar lata mangeshkar ke saath unka vivaad bhi unki dariyaadilii kaa suchak he
 At that time, Lataji said that even after singing the songs, singers and singers should get a part of the income from those songs
 rafi sahab iske kilaaf the or unka kahana tha ki ek baar gane record ho gaye or gayak-gayikaon ko unki fees kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya ho to unako or paison kii aashaa nahin kerani chahie
 There was a conflict between the two great artists about this
 lata ne rafi ke saath set par gane se manaa kar diya or barason tak dono kaa koi yugal geet nahin aayaa
 Later, at the behest of actress Nargis, both of them started singing together and sang Dil Pukare in the Jewel Thief film
 unka dehant 31 july 1980 ko hridaygati ruk janeke kaaran hua
 There is some controversy over how many songs Rafi sang in his life
 1970 ke dashak main gineez book of world ricards ne likhaa ki sabase adhik gane ricard karne kaa shrey lata mangeshkar ko praapt he, jinhone kul 25,000 gane ricard kiye hai
 Rafi wrote a letter to the Guinness Book, refuting it
 iske baad ke sanskarnon main gineez book ne donon gayakon ke daawey saath-saath pradarshit kiye or mohammad rafi ko 1944 or 1980 ke bich 28,000 gane ricard karne kaa shrey diya
 In the subsequent search, Vishwas Nerurkar found that Lata had actually sung only 5,044 songs till 1989
 anya shodhakartaaon ne bhi is tathy ko sahi mana he
 Additionally, Raju Bharatan found that between 1948 and 1987 only 35,000 Hindi songs were recorded
 aise main rafi ne 28,000 gane gaae is baat par yakeen karnaa mushkil he, lekin kuch strot ab bhi is sankhya ko uddhrut karte hai
 After this research, in 1992, the Guinness Book removed the above record of singing from the book

 niti kaa arth he tark par aadhaarit kaary, jo vartmaan or bhavishya ko prabhavit kare
 Its purpose is to progressively improve its position

 The responsibility of implementing the foreign policy of a country rests with the foreign department of that country

 Depending on its merit, it depends on how it will maintain the national interests, honor and prestige of the country

 Through these efforts, the voice of the country can be heard in the international world
 iskaa ek galat kadam desh ko andhkaar ke gart main le ja saktaa he
 Foreign policy has a worldwide impact
 swatantrata purv british bhartiya sarkaar kaa ek videsh vibhaag tha
 It was first constructed in 1784 under the era of Warren Hastings
 1842 tak yah gupt or raajnneetik vibhaag ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, baad main ise videsh vibhaag kaha jane laga
 It had three subdivisions - Foreign, Political and Home
 1914 ke pashchaat yah videsh or raajnneetik vibhaag kahalaane laga
 Due to the increased work as a result of the Act of 1935, the foreign and political departments were converted into separate independent departments
 1945 main is vibhaag ko naveen naam diya gaya “videsh vibhaag or rashtramandaleey sambandh vibhaag“
 When he took over the interim government in 1946, Nehru took the direction of this department in his own hands
 march 1949 main mantralay ke in do vibhaagon ko ek kar diya gaya tathaa ise videsh mantralay kaa naam diya gaya, jis naam se yah aaj bhi janaa jaataa he
 There are basically five functions of the State Department - in kaaryon kii purti ke liye videsh vibhaag suchnaayen ekatrit karata he, unka adhyayan kar videsh mantri tathaa mantrimandal ko paraamarsh detaa he
 The State Department also plays an important role in relations with various countries in the economic field, counseling for protection against threats to the security of the country and cultural and publicity work
 kisi bhi desh kii niti kaa nirmaan koun karata he, yah nishchit rup se kahana ati kathin he

 On the basis of the parliamentary democratic system, it is appointed by the Prime Minister from one of the members of the majority ruling, who is responsible to the Cabinet and the Prime Minister

 He could not believe that any non-maharashtrian Abraham of North India could reach the pinnacle of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on which he has been imposing the image of the monopoly of Maharashtrian Brahmins till now - that too unanimously

 But how long could one be taken away from his body which was severely broken by non-working and social thinking
 atev san 1999 main hi unhone us daayitv kaa bhaar kisi kam umr ke vyakti ko saunpane kaa man bana liya
 And finally, after waiting for a year, respecting the earnest request of his colleagues, in March 2000, he handed over this responsibility to Sudarshanji and presented a model to the Union for voluntary retirement
 rajju bhaiya kii 60 varsh lambi sangh-yatra keval is drushti se hi asaamaanya nahin he ki kis prakaar ve ek ke baad doosraa bada daayitv safaltaapurvak nibhaate rahe apitu is drushti se bhi he ki 1943 se 1966 tak ve prayag vishvavidhyalay main adhyaapan kaary ke saath-saath ek purnakalik prachaarak kii bhanti yatra-tatra-sarvatra ghoomte hue samast dayitvon kaa nirvaah karte rahe

 Even while teaching in Prayag University, he was busy campaigning in union work
 aupchaarik taur par unhen prachaarak 1958 main ghoshit kiya gaya par sachaai yah he ki unhone kaarywah pad ko prachaarak kii bhoomika swayan pradaan kar di
 Rajju Bhaiya was one of the most popular and successful professors of Prayag University due to his very simple and interesting teaching style and affection towards his disciples, besides possessing unusual authority on esoteric subjects like physics
 varishthata or yogyata ke kaaran unhen kai varshon tak vibhaag ke adhyaksh-pad kaa daayitv bhi professor ke saath-saath sanbhaalanaa padaa
 But in spite of all this, they continued to fulfill their duties in the union work

 The days when he was asked to apply for the post of Reader of Physics Department in Prayag University, he did not give the application
 sahyogiyon ne poocha ki rajju bhaiya! aapane aisa kyon kiya? to unhone bade sahaj dhang se uttar diya- "are meraa jivan-kaary to sangh-kaary he, vishvavidhyalay kii professori nahin
 Right now i take classes four days a week, three days i visit for union work
 kabhi-kabhi bahut koshish karne par bhi vishvavidhyalay samay par nahin pahunch paata
 Right now all the teachers of the department support me, but if i become a candidate on the post of reader, then they will start thinking of me as their competitor
 isliye kyon is pachade main fasana
 "rajju Bhaiya's entire life is a witness to the fact that he has never had any aspiration or desire for the post
 vishvavidhyalay main adhyaaapak rah kar bhi unhone apane liye dhanarjan nahin kiya
 They used to spend every pie of their salary on union work
 sampann parivaar main janm lene, public skulon main shiksha paane, sangeet or cricket jaise khelon main ruchi hone ke baad bhi ve apane upar kam se kam kharch karte the
 He was a rare example of austerity
 varsh ke ant main apane vetan main se jo kuch bachataa use guru-dakshina ke rup main samaaj ko arpit kar dete the
 Once Rashtradham Prakashan got stuck in the economic crisis, he urged his father to repay Rashtradharma Prakashan by giving his share money
 yah thi unki sarvatyagi sannyast vritti kii abhivyakti! Rajju Bhaiya was dear to everyone due to selfless affection and unselfish work

 He also gained the trust and affection of politicians like Purshottam Das Tandon and Lal Bahadur Shastri as well as saints like Prabhudatta Brahmachari
 bahut samvedansheel ant:karan ke saath-saath rajju bhaiya ghor yathartwaadee bhi the
 He used to say anything unacceptable to anyone and it was difficult to avoid his talk
 apatkaal ke baad janata party kii sarkaar main jab nanaaji deshmukh ko udyog mantri kaa pad dena nishchit ho gaya to rajju bhaiya ne unase kaha ki nanaaji agar aap, atalji or adwaniji - teenon sarkaar main chale jaayenge to baahar rahakar sanghathan ko koun sanbhaalega? nanaaji ne unki ichha kaa aadar karte hue turant mantripad thukraa diya or janata party kaa mahasachiv bananaa sweekaar kiya

 Its author is Annambatta
 iske adhyayan se nyaay evam vaisheshik ke sabhi mul siddhanton kaa gyaan mil jaataa he
 Whatever is about the 'substances' in this book is completely according to Vaisesika whereas what is about the 'evidence' is completely according to justice
 arthath padaarthon ke liye 'vaisheshik mat' ko sweekaar kiya gaya he tathaa pramaan ke liye 'nyaay mat' ko
 Thus, through this book, justice and Vaishyak opinion have been merged into one
 annanbhatta ne baalkon ko sukhpurvak nyaayapadaarthon kaa gyaan karaane ke uddeshy se tarksangrah naamak anworth laghugranth kii rachana kii tathaa iske atisankshipt arth ko spasht karne ke abhipraay se swayan deepika naamak vyakhya granth kii bhi rachana kii
 The beginning of this book has been emphasizing that the subject is presented in a very simple way - tarksangrah nyaay-vaisheshik parampara kaa mahatvapurn granth he
 Here the word 'logic' means 'fluidyya sapta substance' in justice, the word logic has given many meanings
 is shabd kaa ukt arth jo yahaan diya gaya he vah asaadhaaran he
 The word 'collection' is used in the sense of abbreviation
 vaakya-vivritti ke anusaar sangrah ke antargat uddesh, lakshan or pariksha aate hai
 Purpose means calculation
 kisi padaarth ke asaadhaaran dharm kaa kathan uskaa lakshan kehalaata he tathaa lakshith padaarth main lakshan thik thik baithta he athwa nahin is prakaar kaa vichaar karnaa pariksha kehalaati he
 Thus, collection of arguments means the computation of liquified seven substances along with their symptoms and a brief rendering of the examination of those symptoms
 yah granth nyaay vaisheshik kaa prakaran granth he
 The definition of the case is as follows: - is paribhaasha ke anusaar ‘prakaran’ sampoorn shastra ke vishay se sambaddh na hokar uske kisi vishisht vishay se sambaddh hona chahie
 When the word 'case' comes in the meaning of a part of the book, it is always the same, but when it is used in the meaning of free text, we do not always get the same topic of scripture in it
 kuch prakaran to avashya aise paye jate hai jahaan shaastra ke ek hi vishay kaa nirupan he, jaise shankaracharyakrit ‘pachikarnaprakriya’, kintu adhikansh prakaran-ganth aise hai jinamein shaastra ke sampoorn vishyon kaa sankshep main vivechan he
 Such are the scriptures of Saptapadarthi, logic, logic, etc

 Nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen of the Earth's atmosphere is converted into ammonium] or other molecules beneficial to organisms

 Nitrogen fixation is done naturally in soil by microorganisms, such as Azotobacter

 Sometimes there is no fully symbiotic relationship between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants

 Nitrogen fixation is also used in the process of production of nox in the atmosphere by celestial electricity

 This festival is also known as 'herath' or 'herath' every night and colloquially in Kashmir Shaivism
 mahashivaratri se sambadhit kai puranic kathayen he: On the day of Mahashivaratri, Lord Shiva kept a poison named Kalkut in his throat
 jo samudr manthan ke samay baahar aayaa tha
 Once Parvati ji asked Lord Shiva Shankar, 'what is the best and simple fast-worship, from which the beings of the dead land get your grace easily?' In reply, Shivji told this story by telling Parvati to observe the fast of 'shivratri' - 'once there was a hunter named Chitrabhanu
 pashuon kii hatya karke vah apane kutumb ko paalataa tha
 He was indebted to a moneylender, but could not repay his loan on time
 krodhit sahuukaar ne shikari ko shivamath main bandi bana liya
 Coincidentally it was Shivratri that day
 ' The hunter meditated and kept listening to religious things related to Shiva
 chaturdashi ko usne shivaratri vrath kii katha bhi suni
 Just before dusk, the moneylender called him to him and talked about repaying the loan
 shikari agle din sara rin lautaa dene kaa vachan dekar bandhan se chhot gaya
 Like his daily routine he went out hunting in the forest
 lekin dinabhar bandi grih main rahane ke kaaran bhukh-pyaas se vyakul tha
 To hunt, he started making a halt on the vine tree on the banks of a pond
 bel vriksh ke neeche shivlinga tha jo vilvapatron se dhakaa hua tha
 Hunter could not find the person
 padaav banaate samay usne jo tahaniyaan todin, ve sanyog se shivlinga par giriin
 In this way, fasting and thirsty hunters were also fasted throughout the day and bell-sheets were also climbed on the Shivling
 ek pahar raatri biit jane par ek garbhini mrigi talab par pani pine pahunchi
 As soon as the hunter drew an arrow on the bow, the antelope said, 'I am pregnant
 sheeghra hi prasav karuungi
 You will kill two creatures simultaneously, which is not right
 main bachche ko janm dekar sheeghra hi tumhaare samaksh prastut ho jaaoongi, tab maar lenaa
 The hunter loosened the cross and the deer disappeared into the wild bushes
 kuch hi der baad ek or mrigi udhar se nikali
 The hunter was over the moon
 sameep aane par usne dhanush par baan chadhaaya
 Seeing him, the deer politely pleaded, 'O Pardhi! i retired from the season a while ago
 kamaatur virahinee hum
 i am wandering in search of my beloved main apane pati se milakar sheeghra hi tumhaare paas aa jaaoongi
 ' The hunter let him go as well
 do baar shikaar ko khokar uskaa maathaa thanka
 He was in all sort of thoughts
 raatri kaa aakhri pahar biit rahaa tha
 Then another antelope escaped with her children
 shikari ke liye yah svarnim avasar tha
 He did not take long to shoot arrows at the bow
 vah tir chhodane hi vaala tha ki mrigi boli, 'he pardhi!' main in bacchon ko inke pita ke hawaale karke laut aauungi
 Do not kill me this time
 shikari hansaa or bolaa, saamne aae shikaar ko chhod duun, main aisa murkh nahin
 i have lost my prey twice before
 mere bachche bhukh-pyaas se tadap rahe honge
 In response, the deer again said, as you are maltreating your children, just like me too
 isliye sirf bacchon ke naam par main thodi der ke liye jeevandaan maang rahi hum
 Hey Pardhi! Trust me, i promise to leave them to their father and return immediately
 mrigi kaa deen swar sunakar shikari ko us par dayaa aa gai
 He let that chicken escape too
 shikaar ke abhaav main bel-vrikshapar baitha shikari belptr tod-todakar neeche phenkata ja rahaa tha
 When the dawn broke, a strong deer came on the same path
 shikari ne soch liya ki iskaa shikaar vah avashya karegaa
 Seeing the trunk of the hunter, he said in a loud voice, o brother! If you have killed three antelopes and small children coming before me, do not delay in killing me, so that i do not have to suffer even a single moment in their disconnection
 main un mrigiyon kaa pati hum
 If you have given them life, please give me some life too
 main unase milakar tumhaare samaksh upasthit ho jaaoongaa
 As soon as he heard the deer, the whole night cycle happened in front of the hunter, he narrated the whole story to the deer
 tab mrug ne kaha, 'meri teenon patniyaan jis prakaar pratigyabaddh hokar gai hai, meri mrityu se apane dharm kaa paalan nahin kar paaengi
 So, just as you have left him as a confidant, let me also go
 main un sabake saath tumhaare saamne sheeghra hi upasthit hota hum
 'fasting, night-awakening and climbing the bell leaf on the Shivling, the violent heart of the hunter was purged
 usamen bhagavad shakti kaa vaas ho gaya tha
 The bow and arrow were easily left from his hand
 bhagwaan shiv kii anukanpa se uskaa hinsak hriday kaarunik bhaavon se bhar gaya
 He started burning in the flame of repentance remembering his past deeds
 thodi hi der baad vah mrug sapariwaar shikari ke samaksh upasthit ho gaya, taaki vah unka shikaar kar sake, kintu junglee pashuon kii aisi satyata, satviktaa evam samuhik prembhaavana dekhakar shikari ko badi glani hui
 There was a burst of tears from his eyes

 All the Dev Samaj from Devalok were also watching this event

 It is one of the largest international gateways in the country and is the third busiest airport in India and an international hub, which has been handling around 120 million passengers since 2007 and serves over 25 different airlines
 
 desh main mumbai ke baad yah doosraa sabase bada naubhaar centre he
 It is located near Meenambakkam and Tirusulam, where passenger entry takes place in Tirusulam and goods entry is in Meenambakkam
 madras kaa hawaii adda bharat ke pehle hawaii addon main se ek he or 1954 main bombai se belgaum ke zarie air india kii pehali udaan kaa gantavy sthaan tha
 Its first passenger terminal was built to the northeast of the airport, which falls in the Meenambakkam suburb, which is why it is cited as Meenambakkam Airport
 baad main ek nayaa terminal parisar tirusulam main banaaya gaya or uske dakshin main pallaavarm ke sameep, yatri sanchalanon ko sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 The old terminal building is now used as a cargo terminal and is the base of the Indian courier company Blue Dart
 chennai antarrashtriya hawaii adde par teen terminal hai: minambakkam main sthit sabase puraane terminal kaa prayog cargo ke liye kiya jaataa he, jabaki tirusulam main yatriyon ke liye bane nae terminal bhawan kaa prayog yatri sanchalanon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The passenger terminal complex consists of domestic and international terminals interconnected by a connecting building, which has administrative offices and a restaurant
 haalanki yah parisar ek akhand sanrachana he, lekin iskaa nirmaan vardhaman taur par hua, jisamen 1988 ke dauraan kamraj or anna terminal ko pehle se maujuud minambakkam terminal ke saath joda gaya
 The first part built was an international terminal, with two aerobridges, followed by a domestic terminal with three aerobridges
 gharelu terminal kaa nirmaan kaary puraa hone ke baad minambakkam ke puraane terminal kaa istemaal vishesh rup se cargo ke liye kiya gaya
 Recently the international terminal was expanded to the south and a new block was added, consisting of three aerobridges
 is samay, nae antarrashtriya khand kaa prayog prasthaan ke liye or puraane bhawan kaa prayog aagaman ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Domestic flights operate from Kamaraj domestic terminals, while Anna International terminals are for international flights
 minambakkam par sthit puraane terminal kaa istemaal cargo oparation ke liye kiya jaataa he
 At this time, Chennai Airport operates about 25 aircraft flights per hour, which will be fully filled in the year 2014-15
 However, the ability to handle traffic in peak hours will be depleted much earlier
 Anna International Terminal handled 3,410,253 passengers in 2007-08 and has a capacity to handle 3 crore passengers per annum and has already exceeded the capacity to handle passengers

 In the structure of Internet-related addresses, a private network is a network that uses private IP address space, following the standards set by RFC 1918 and RFC 4193
 jab vaishvik maarg se bheje jane yogya paton kii anivaaryta nahin hoti he yaa phir ye apekshit network anuprayogon ke liye uplabdh nahin hote hai to in paton kaa istemaal aam taur par ghar, karyaalay or udhyam ke local aria networkon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The locations of private IP addresses were originally defined in an attempt to delay the nullification of ipv4 addresses but can also be seen in the next generation Internet protocol, ipv6
 in paton ko privet ke rup main isliye paribhaashit kiya jaataa he kyonki inhen vaishvik str par nahin diya gaya he, matlab yah ki inhen kisi vishisht sanghathan ko aavantit nahin kiya jaataa he or inke dwaara sambodhit ypi packeton ko saarvajanik internet par prasaarit nahin kiya jaataa he
 These addresses can be used by anyone without approval from the Regional Internet Registry
 agar is tarah ke privet network ko internet se jodne kii jarurat hoti he to iske liye yaa to ek network pataa anuvadak getwe yaa phir ek proxi sarwar kaa istemaal karnaa anivaary he
 The most common use of these addresses is in residential networks, since most Internet service providers allocate an IP address sent to each residential customer through a one-way route only, but most households have more than one network device, for example, Many computers and a video game console
 In this case a NAT gateway is typically used to enable Internet connectivity for many users
 nijee paton ko saamanytah corporate networkon main bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he jo suraksha kaarnon se internet se sidhe taur par jude nahin hote hai
 a proxy, SOCKS gateway or other similar devices are often used to provide limited access to the Internet to internal users of the network
 donon hi maamalon main nijee paton ko aksar aantarik network ke liye behatar suraksha ke rup main dekha jaataa he kyonki internet host ke liye sidhe taur par ek aatanrik pranali se sambandh jodna mushkil hota he
 Because many private networks use the same IP address, a common problem arises in mixing such networks together, the collision of address locations, ie the duplication of addresses on many devices
 In this case, the network must essentially re-number which is often a time-consuming task, or a NAT router must be placed between networks to hide the copied addresses
 nijee paton ke sthanon main banane vaale packeton kaa internet par li hona asaamaanya nahin he
 Poorly configured private networks often try to look for these addresses in reverse DNS, causing additional traffic problems for Internet route nameservers
 eyes112 project ne nijee paton ke liye vishesh blueole anicast nemsarvaron kii vyavastha kar is bhaar ko kam karne kii koshish kii thi jo in sawaalon ke uttaraswaroop keval nakaaratmak parinaam code hi pradaan karte hai
 Organizational sector routers were typically designed to reduce the arrival of IP traffic to these networks which could either be sudden or could be done through malicious traffic using a fake source address 
 aiespi age router graahakon ke paas se is tarah ke trephic ke nirgaman ko band kar dete hai jo graahak ke network par un trutipurna tareekon se banaae gaye yaa mailicious host ke internet par prabhaav ko kam kar detaa he, lekin aisa kaaphi kam hota he
 The Internet Engineering Task Force has directed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority to reserve the following ipv4 addresses range for private networks, as published in RFC 1918: classphul adressing ab aprachlit he or 1993 main shuru kiye gaye classles inter-domen rooting ke lagu hone ke baad se internet main iskaa prayog nahin kiya gaya he
 For example, while 10
0
0
0 / 8 was a single Class a network, in institutions it was usually divided into smaller / 16 or / 24 networks
 is tarah ke networkon ke liye nijee networkon or vishesh paton ke aarakshan kii avadharana ko protocol internet ipivi6 kii agali peedi main sthanantarit kiya gaya he
 The address block fc00 :: / 7 has been reserved by IANA as described in RFC 4193
 in paton ko unic local adresses kaha jaataa he
 Their character is defined as unicast and a 40-bit random number exists in the routing prefix to prevent collisions when two private networks are interconnected
 upyog main swaabhaavik rup se local hone ke baavjood unic local adresses kaa ipivi6 adress scope global hota he
 Addresses, section "ipv6 Address Scopes"
) ek purv maanak ne fec0:: / 10 range main tathakthith "site-local" paton ke upyog kaa prastaav kiya tha lekin maapniyata kii pramukh chintaaon or site kii ek kharaab paribhaasha ke kaaran refsi 3879 dwaara sitambar 2004 se iske istemaal ko anuchit qaraar diya gaya he
 Another type of private networking uses the local-link address range codified in RFC 5735 and RFC 3927
 in paton kii upyogita network upkarnon dwaara swayan-swachaalit concigareshan main he jab dynamik host concigareshan protocol sevaayen uplabdh nahin hoti hai or ek network vyavasthaapak dwaara minial concigareshan vaanchhneeya nahin hota he
 Block 169
254 / 16 in ipv4 is reserved for this purpose where the first and last / 24 subnets in this range are as exceptions
 agar iiqui 802 network diechasipi ke madhyam se koi network pataa praapt nahin kar paata he to 169
254
1
0 se lekar 169
254
254
255 tak ek pataa sudorandem tareeke se aavantit kiya ja saktaa he
 The standard dictates that address collisions should be handled efficiently
 ipivi6 adressing architekchar ypi pate ke swachaalit concigareshan ke liye fe80:: / 10 block ko kinare vyavasthit kar detaa he
 Historically, other address blocks have been reserved for other possible uses of the future than the range of private addresses

 yah sunishchit karata he ki anuprayog lagaataar, sahi dhang se, samay par or bajet par or aavashyaktaaon ke bheetar banaaya gaya he
 The demand for software engineering has also emerged to meet user requirements and the enormous rate of change in the environment on which the application is to be applied
 vivaran: kitni aasaani se yah and-yuzar or yah upyogkarta ke liye pradaan karata he suvidhaon dwaara upyog kiya ja saktaa dwaara ek software utpaada mana jaataa he
 An application will score in the following fields: - 1) aaparational:-yah kitna acha ek software kahata he bajet, prayojya, kshamta, shuddhta, kaaryakshmata, dependability, suraksha or suraksha kii tarah karrwai par kaam karata he

 arabi: علي ابن أبي طالب Ali Ibne Abi Talib was born on 17 March under the Kaaba, a pilgrimage site for 600 Muslims
 ve paigambar mohammad ke chachazad bhai or damaad the or unka charchit naam hazarat ali he
 They are known as the Khalifa of Muslims
 unhone 656 se 661 tak rashidoon kilaafat ke chauthe caliph ke rup main shashan kiya, or shiya islam ke anusaar ve632 to 661 tak pehle imam the
 Apart from this, he is also considered the first Muslim scientist
 unhone vaigyanik jaankariyon ko bahut hi rochak dhang se aam aadmi tak pahunchaaya tha
 Born to Abu Talib and Fatima bin Assad, Ali is the only person born in the holy sanctuary of the Kaaba in Mecca, the holiest place in Islam, according to many classical Islamic
 strot, vishesh rup se shiya vaale
 Ali was the first male to accept Islam, and according to some authors was the first Muslim
 ali ne mohammad ko shuruaati umr se sangrakshit kiya or navjaat muslim samudaay dwaara ladi lagbhag sabhi ladaai main hissaa liya
 After moving to Medina, she married Muhammad's daughter Fatima
 khalif uthman ebn afaan kii hatya ke baad, 656 main mohammad ke saathi ne unhen khalipha niyukt kiya tha
 Ali's reign led to civil wars and in 661, he was attacked and murdered by the Kharijites while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, two days later martyred
 raajnneetik or aadhyatmik rup se shiya or sunni donon ke liye ali mahatvapurn he
 Many biographical sources about Ali are often biased according to sectarian lines, but they agree that he was a pious Muslim, who was a ruler because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah
 jabaki sunise ali ko rashidun khalif ke chauthe or final par vichaar karte hai, shiya musalamaanon ne ali ko gadir khum main ghatnaon kii vyakhya ke kaaran mohammad ke baad pehali imam ke rup main mana
 Shia Muslims also believe that Ali and other Shia are members of the Imam) are the rightful heirs to Muhammad
 yah asahmati thi ki umah ko shiya or sunni shakhaon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha
 Ali's father, Abu Talib, was the patron of the Kaaba of Banu Hashim, an important branch of the powerful Qureshi tribe and was a sheikh
 vah mohammad kaa chachaa bhi tha, or abdul mutalib ke baad mohammad uthaaya tha
 Ali's mother Fatimah bin Assad also belonged to Banu Hashim, from which Ali Ibahim was a descendant of Ibrahim's son
 kai strot, khaskar shii, yah pramanit karte hai ki ali makka shahar main kaaba ke andar paidaa hua tha, jahaan vah teen dinon tak apni maa ke saath rahaa
 While visiting Kaaba his mother felt the onset of his labor pains and entered where his son was born
 kuch shiya sroton main ali kii maa ke pravesh ke chamatkaari vivaran kaaba main hai
 Ali's birth in the Kaaba is believed to be a unique event proving his "high spiritual station" among Shias, while among various Sunni scholars it is considered a great, if not unique, distinction
 ek parampara ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jise ali ne dekha tha kyonki usne apane haathon main navjaat shishu ko liya tha
 Muhammad named him Ali, meaning "great"
 ali ke mata-pita ke saath mohammad kaa ghanishtha sambandh tha
 When Muhammad became orphaned and later lost his grandfather Abdul Muttalib, Ali's father took him to his home
 mohammad ne khaadiya bint khuvelid se shaadi ke baad ali kaa janm do yaa teen saal baad hua tha
 When Ali was five, Muhammad took Ali to his house to raise him
 kuch itihaaskaar kehete hai ki aisa isliye tha kyonki us samay makka main ek akaal tha or ali ke pita kaa samarthan karne ke liye ek bada parivaar tha; haalanki, anya log bataate hai ki ali ko unke pita par boj nahin hota tha, kyonki ali us samay paanch varsh kaa tha or akaal ke baavjood, ali ke pita, jo vittiya rup se acchhee tarah se band the, ajanabiyon ko bhojan dene ke liye jane jate the agar ve bhukhe the
 While it is not disputed that Muhammad raised Ali, it was not due to any financial stress that Ali's father was leaving
 ali paanch saal kii umr se mohammad or mohammad kii patni khadija ke saath rah rahe the
 When Ali was nine years old, Muhammad proclaimed himself as the Prophet of Islam, and Ali became the first child to accept Islam
 khadija ke baad islam ko sweekaar karne ke baad vah doosraa vyakti the
 According to Saeed Ali Asghar Razvi in the reorganization of the history of Islam and Muslims, "ali and the Quran grew up as 'twins' in the house of Muhammad Mustafa and khadija-tul-kubra"
 " Ali's second period of life began in 610 when he declared Islam at the age of 9 and ended with Medina in 622, with Muhammad's Hijra
