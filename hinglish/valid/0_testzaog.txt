 This list is of television channels in India: udaan kiran bedi ke jivan se prerit doordarshan par prasaarit ek lokapriy television dharawahik tha jiske nirdesan ke saath saath kendriya bhoomika kavita choudhary ne nibhaai thi
 Kavita was earlier known as Lalita in a soap advertising film
 is dharawahik main saadharan parivaar kii ek ladki ke ek ipies afasar banane kaa safar dikhaaya gaya tha
 The serial also had Vikram Gokhale and Shekhar Kapoor in pivotal roles
 arastu kaa anukaran siddhant ek str par plato kaa anukaran siddhant kii pratikriya he or duusare str par uskaa vikaas bhi
 The great philosopher Plato had reduced his importance by calling art and poetry at a triple distance from truth
 uske shishy arastu ne anukaran main punarrachana kaa samavesh kiya
 According to him, imitation is not an exact copy but a re-presentation which also includes reconstruction
 anukaran ke dwaara kalakaar saarvbhaum ko pahachaanakar use saral tathaa indriya rup se punah roopaagat karne kaa praytn karata he
 The poet is free to emulate any of the three possible probables or ideals
 vah samvednaa, gyaan, kalpana, adarsh aadi dwaara apurna ko purna banaata he
 There is a natural curiosity here that why Aristotle gave so much importance to imitation in poetry-discussion? In this context, the following reasons may be mentioned- Before 1 Aristotle, his Guru Plato considered poetry and other arts to be inferior due to his association with Anukriti business philosophy
 arestu ne use maatr kavy or sristi ke sambandh main grahan kiya
 With this, he changed the meaning of simulation and its sounds
 ;2ddh arestu ne plato ke samaan chitra or kavy ko spasht rup se anukaran-mulak kaha he
 ; 3) Aristotle considers tragedy in poetry as the most important poem, all his poetry-discussion has been in reference to the discussion of tragedy
 traasadee main anukaran kii pradhanta hoti he, atah arestu ke kavy-vivechan main anukaran kii pradhanta hona swaabhaavik he
 ; 4 In the Greek language, the word 'poytes' is used for the poet, whose derivation is - Karta or Author
 kavi ghatnaon kaa kartta nahin anukartta mana ja saktaa he
 Thus, the relation of the primacy of imitation is linked to the etymology of 'poytes'
 anek aalochakon ne arestu kii bhinn-bhinn prakaar se vyakhya kii he, kintu ek baat main sabhi sahamat hai ki arestu ne anukaran kaa prayog plato kii bhanti sthool yathavat pratikruti ke arth main nahin kiya
 These interpretations are important in themselves
 phir bhi arestu ke shabdon ko pramaan maanakar anukaran kaa vivechan karnaa samichin hoga
 Art is an imitation of nature
 yah kala or anukaran donon tattvon kaa vivechan kaa mul sutara he
 Here the word prakriti is more expansive than imitation
 horess ke aadhaar par navyashastravaadiyon ne prakruti kaa arth kiya- niti, niyamon se paribaddh jivan or anukaran kaa arth kiya - yathavat pratyankan, is prakaar arestu kaa yah sutara reetibaddh kavy-rachana kaa prerak mantra ban gaya
 But there is no reason to limit the meaning of nature in this way
 yahan prakruti jivan ke samgr rup arthath antarbahya, donon roopon kii samshti kaa paryaay he
 It does not mean Aristotle as a voluminous form, that is, imitating non-human nature is not the name of imitative art
 kavi yaa kalakaar prakruti kii sarjan-prakriya kaa anukaran karata he
 Imitation is not the perishable things, but the nature-law contained in them
 atah arestu ke anusaar- ‘‘prayek vastu purna viksit hone par jo hoti he use hi ham uski prakruti kehete hai
 "nature continues to work towards the achievement of this ideal form
" kintu kai kaarnon se vah apane lakshya kii prapti main safal nahin ho paati
 These shortcomings of nature in simulation can be fulfilled by art
 is prakaar anukaran ek sarjan-kriya he
 Poetry-art completes the unfinished work of nature, following the surgeon process of nature
 isi se kavy main anukaran tatva kii mahatta he
 According to Aristotle, imitation can be any one of the three types of objects - as they were or as they are said or perceived, as they should be
 inhen ko kramshah pratiyaman, sambha×ya or adarsh rup mana gaya he
 The poet has the freedom to portray the object or subject as it appears to her senses or may or should appear in the future
 nishchay hi isamen kavi kii bhaavana or kalpana kaa yogadan hoga - vah nakal maatr nahin hoga
 This is why Aristotle follows the principle of spirit and imagined imitation, not pure nature
 kavy satya ke sambandh main apane vichaaron ko siddh karne ke liye arestu ne kavita or itihaas par tulanaatmak drushti se vichaar kiya he
 Butcher explained this fact as follows- arthath kavi-karm jo kuch ghatit ho chukaa he, uskaa varnan karnaa nahin, varan jo kuch ghatit ho saktaa he- jo kuch sambhaavna yaa anivaaryta ke niyamadhin sambhav he- uskaa varnan karnaa he
 


 Poets and historians do not distinguish between prose and poetry writing
 xxrep 5 
 varan unamem vaastavik bhed yah he ki ek uskaa varnan karata he jo ghatit ho chukaa he tathaa doosraa uskaa varnan karata he jo ghatit ho saktaa he
 So poetry is superior to history, because poetry portrays the universal, whereas history is special
 ’’ According to Aristotle, "the real difference between poet and historian is that one describes what has happened and the other describes what may have happened
" parinamtah kavy main darshaniktaa adhik hoti he
 Its form is greater than history, because poetry is an expression of the general and of history
 ’’ itihaas kii ghatnaayen desh-kaal kii seemaa se bandhakar keval apane pruthak or vishisht rup main hamaare saamne aati hai, jabaki kavy-nibaddh tathy apane-apane saarvbhaum rup main abhivyakt hote hai
 Hence their repetition is possible
 is prakaar kavy or itihaas sambandhi vivechan main anukaran se he, yatharth vastuparak pratyankan se nahin
 Aristotle has written in his discussion of tragedy that tragedy is a simulation of work and life, not of humans
 ‘kaary’ shabd kaa prayog unhone maanav-jivan kaa chitra ke arth main kiya he
 According to him, whatever expresses the inner side of human life, inaugurates the intellectual personality, everything will come under 'work'
 atah kaary kaa arth keval manushya ke karm hi nahin, uske bhav, vichaar, charitra aadi bhi he jo karm ke prati uttaradaayi hote hai
 Hence, the subject of simulation is a working human
 arestu kaa vichaar he ki anukool vastu se praapt anand bhi kam saarvbhaum nahin he- ‘‘jin vastuon kaa pratyaksh darshan hamen dukh detaa he, unka anukaran dwaara prastut rup hamen anand pradaan karata he
 We are afraid to see scary animals, but their friendly form makes us happy
 ’’ atah anukaran anand kaa tatva anivarytah nihit hone kaa arth yahi he ki usamen aatm-tatva kaa prakaashan nihit rahata he, kyonki anand kii uplabdhi aatmatatva ke prakaashan ke bina sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, imitation would certainly be emotional and imaginary rather than objective objective notation
 kintu bhav-tatva or usamen nihit aatm tatva kaa sadbhaav hone par bhi anukaran vishuddh, atmabhivyanjan kaa paryaay nahin he, kyonki isamen vastu-tatva kii pradhanta anivaary he
 Modern criticism takes the shelter of the terminology of scripture, in imitation, it is the acceptance of the object-matter of the aristocratic art, but not the subjective sentiment of the art of art
 is prakaar usamen jivan kii anubhutiyon se nirmit kavi kii antashchetana ko paryaapt mahatva nahin mila he
 All the topics which are discussed in the simulation, despite being gross and subtle, are non-functional, they are good
 unki sthiti anukartta se baahar he
 Therefore, imitation cannot be kept in the category of pure self-expression in the absence of subjective feeling
 prashn he ki anukaran siddhanth kii vyapti kahan tak he? niti kavy kii vaiyaktik anubhutiyon kaa udgith anukaran kii paridhi main kaise aa saktaa he? arestu ne geetikavy ko upekshit kar diya he
 He considered the song to be an ornament of poetry
 arestu kaa pakshpaati yah bhi tark detaa he ki jis prakaar traasadee main duusare kii anubhutiyon kaa anukaran sambhav he, usee prakaar geetikavy main bhi apni anubhutiyon kaa anukaran sambhav he
 But the question of imitating that which is self-expressed, does not arise
 atah anukaran shabd kaa arth itnaa arth-vistaar sambhav nahin he ki geetikavy ko yathavat uski paridhi main antarbhoot kiya ja sake, yahi uski parisima he
 Imitation theory is also strongly opposed to the intuitive theory of Croche
 kroche ke anusaar, kavy-kala kaa jo moulik rup he, vah anukaran kaa vishay nahin ho saktaa or uskaa murtt rup, jo anukaran kaa vishay he, kroche ke anusaar sarvatha aanushanbik he
 Aristotle's imitation theory cannot contain any kind of spontaneity
 atah jis ansh tak kroche kaa sahjanubhuti siddhanth maanya he, usee ansh tak anukaran siddhanth amaanya he
 Dr
 Nagendra, while discussing the principle of imitation, has clarified that there is a difference between creation and imitation
 kavy main vastuon ke marm ko aakarshak reeti se udghaatit karnaa kavi-karm he
 It has two sides - philosophy of the essence of the object and expression in its words
 These two sides are integral
 kavy donon kii samanvit kriya he, anukaran nahin
 The poet's talent is caricature, not an acaryatry
 kavi loukik padaarthon ke maarmik rup kaa udghaatan karata he
 From this, poetry is a new creation, a creation, not a simulation
 vastutah kavi jivan main anubhav main apana drushtikon jod detaa he or yahi drushtikon srijan-tatva he
 With this, the meaning of the word simulation has expanded
 nishkarsh - satya kabhi ekadeshiy nahin hota
 His achievement is done in some form or the other, but the method of achievement and his basic approach is also no less important
 arestu ne kavy yaa kala ko prakruti kaa anukaran mana he
 Therefore, despite imitating art, there is renewal, creation is form
 bholananu, karnaprayag tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke chamoli jile kaa ek gaanv he

 gunasutra yaa chromosome sabhi vanaspatiyon va praaniyon kii koshikaon main paye jane vaale tantu rupi pind hote hai, jo ki sabhi anuvaanshik gunon ko nirdhaarit va sanchaarit karte hai
 The number of chromosomes in each species remains fixed
 maanav koshika main gunasutron kii sankhya 46 hoti he jo 23 ke jode main hote he
 Of these, 22 chromosomes are identical in male and female and homologous to their pairs
 inhen sammilit rup se samajaat gunasutra kehete he
 The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are not the same between men and women, which are called heterogeneous chromosomes
 gunasutra kii sanrachana main do padaarth visheshat: sanmilit rahete hai- DNA is the only genetic material
 di e na e anu kii sanrachana main chaar carbonic samaakshar sammilit hote hai : do purine, do pirimidine, ek chini-dioxyribose or phosforic amla 
 Purine contains adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine has thymine and cytosine
 di en e ke ek anu main do sutara hote hai, jo ek duusare ke chaaron or sarpil rup main valayit hote he
 Each DNA formula consists of one or more of the four organic cells in this sequence - thymine, cytosine, adenine, and guanine, and they are interconnected in a particular way
 in chaar samaakshaaron or unase sambandhit sharkara or phophoric amla anu kaa ek ekak tetraneucliotid hota he or kai sahastra tetraneucliotidon kaa ek di en e anu banataa he
 The reason for the variation of DNA of different beings is the difference in the sequence of cells
 di en e or aisa hi ek doosraa newcliik amla aar en e carbonic samaakshar kii upasthiti ke kaaran parabangnee ko adhikansh 2,600 angstrom ke kshetra main antarleen karte hai
 On this basis, a quantitative quantitative arrival of DNA is made
 praaniyon main do vishesh prakaar ke centresutra paae jate hai
 One is found in some dipterra insecta in the nuclei of the ovarian ligaments
 ye gunasutra usee jati ke saadhaaran gunasutron kii apeksha kai sau gune lambey or chaude hote hai
 For this reason, they are called Mahagunasutra
 inaki sanrachana saadhaaran samasutran or ardhasuthran centresutron se kuch bhinn dikhaai padati he
 Here, instead of one chromosome, a transverse line consists of granules that have more ability to stain
 gunasutra ke ek chor se duusare tak bahut si aisi anuprastha pankti kii sab kanikas ek samaan hoti hai or anya panktiyon kii kanikaon main visheshtaayen or vibhinnataayen hoti he
 As these chromosomes are very long, it is believed that they are completely desensitized and perhaps there is some elongation of the protein
 adhik chaude hone ke kaaran yah he ki ek gunasutra apane samaan ek duusare cendrak-tra kaa sanshleshan karata he
 At the time of samasutraana in ordinary state, these two sutras separate from each other, but in the Mahagunasutra it does not
 donon sutara ek duusare se jude hi rah jate hai
 The number of the Mahagunasutra is half that of the ordinary chromosome, as each sutra is paired with another sutra like it
 is ghatana ko daihik yugman kehete hai
 Another odd chromosome is also found in animals
 isak lampbrush gunasutra kehete hai
 These chromosomes are found in the nuclei of the eggs of animals that have high amounts of eggs, such as fish, amphibians, eggs, birds etc
 gunasutra saadhaaran diplotine-dyakinisis gunasutron ke samaan do do yugmit sutron ke bane hote hai
 Both paired sutras are connected to each other in some places and are far away from each other in other places
 in jodon ko kiesma samajha jaataa he
 On each sutra, which is called chromonima, there are granules of different lamination in place, which are called chromimiers
 prayek chromomier se ek jodi yaa adhik parshvapash jude hue hote he
 The lateral side is also made of a formula similar to chromonema, but the ribonucleo-protein corpuscles are gathered around it, making these formulas appear thick
 chromomier bhi chromonima se santat hote hai
 The nuclei are produced on a particular chromosome
 adhikansh jantuon kii prayek koshika main gunasutron ke do ekatm kulak hote hai
 a clan remains in the mature larynx
 aise praani or koshikaaye dwiganit kahi jaati hai, parantu kuch praaniyon, visheshat: paudhon, main do se adhik kulak gunasutron ke hote hai yah bahugunit kahe jate hai
 If the centrosome of a diploid animal is doubled, so that each of the sutras in its cells is like four, then such a creature is called an autopolyploid
 yadi kisi dwiguneet sankar ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to aise praani ko allopoliploid kehete hai
 If a diploid animal, whose centrosomes are K1a1b1b1c1c1, etc
, is hybridized to another animal, whose chromosomes are K2a2b2b2c2c2, etc
, then its offspring will have chromosome A1a2b1b2c1c2 etc
 k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ityadi ek duusare se bhinn honge or inamen saadhaarant: yugman nahin hoga
 If the chromosomes of this creature are doubled, then in their cells A1a1a2a2; b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2; C1 c1 c2 c2, etc
 will have chromosomes
 yah allopoliploid kaha jayega
 Polyploids may also have more than four kulaks
 yah spasht he ki autopoliploid main zaigotin avasthaa main chatu:sanyojak utpann ho jaayange, kyonki prayek prakaar ke chaar chaar gunasutra upasthit hai or chaar sutron ke yugman se ek chatu:sanyojak banataa he
 At the time of cell division each pole will not get equal number of chromosomes
 praaia: aisa hota he ki ek chatu:sanyojak ke tuutane se kisi dhruv par teen sutara pahunche or uske sanmukh dhruv par ek hi sutara pahunche
 The offspring cells formed at the end of cell division will either have more chromosomes or fewer, and such imbalance results in the cell's death
 isi kaaran autotetraploid bahut kam urvar hote hai
 Autotetraploid plants are much larger than ordinary diploid plants and their seeds are also very large, so that they can prove more beneficial for the householder even when fertility is low
 thandhak pahunchaakar, yaa kuch alkelidon ke prabhaav se, paudhe atopoliplide banaae ja sakate hai
 The conditions are opposite in allotetraploids
 yadi donon aadim matapita ke sutara ek duusare se purna rup se vibhinn hon to allopoliplide kriyaatmak rup se dwiguneet he or purna rup se urvar hoga
 For example, if the formulas in a hybrid are completely different from those of K1a2, B1b2, C1c2, then such a hybrid will be sterile, but this state will be changed by doubling its chromosomes
 aisi koshikaon main k1 k1 k2 k2, kha1 kha1 kha2 kha2, ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2 ityadi sutara honge or jin shakhaon main aisi koshikaaye hongi unpar phool lagenge, kyonki aisi koshikaon main miotic vibhaajan safal hoga, k1 k1 se yugmit hoga, kha1 kha1 se ityadi
 The dhatura stramonium has 12 pairs of chromosomes in the diploid state and becomes bivalent at the time of meiosis
 iske autopoliploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra hote he or ardhasuthran ke samay 12 chatu:sanyojak banate hai
 Similarly, the plant diploid from Primula sinensis has 12 pairs of chromosomes and the autotetraploid has 48 formulas and at the time of meiosis it has 9 to 11 quadruple connectives and 2 to 6 are divalent
 solemon likopersicon ke dwiguneet main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or uske autotetraploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra
 These are all plants
 kripis rubra aura kripis foetida main 5 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 Their formulas do not differ much from each other and in hybrids resulting from their hybridization, 5 bisects are formed at the time of meiosis
 iske allopoliploid main 20 ken drakasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran main 0 se 5 chatu:sanyojak banate hai or 0 se 10 dwisanyojak
 It is clear that allotetraploids will not be very fertile
 primmula floribanda or primmula resticileta donon main hi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare ke praaia: samaan hote hai
 The hybrids that they make from their hybridization are known as primateza kivensis
 isamen bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 At the time of meiosis, the coupling is successful and 9 bisectors are formed
 sutron ke dvigun hone se jo allopoliplide banataa he usamen 9 chatushk sutara hote hai or aise paudhe main 12 se 18 tak dwisanyojak banate hai or 0 se 3 tak chatu:sanyojak
 It is clear that the number of quadrilateral is very small and sometimes not a single quadrant is formed
 muuli or karamkalla main se prayek main 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare se purnat: bhinn hote hai
 The hybrid Raphanus brassicae resulting from their hybridization also has 9 pair of chromosomes; But in meiosis, a single bisector is not formed, because the coupling action is not successful and all the formulas remain unpaired, making 12 unicellular
 iske sutara dvigun se utpann elotetraploid main 12 jodi sutara hote hai or ardhasuthran main 12 sanyojak banate hai, chatu:sanyojak ek bhi nahin
 The result is that raphanus-brassica-allatetraploid is very fertile, although raphanus-brassica-diploid is sterile
 jantuon main poliploidi bahut kam pai jaati he par yah anishekajanit jantuon main bahudhaa pai jaati he
 Many new species in plants may have arisen due to polyploidy
 iskaa pramaan isse miltaa he ki angiousparmon kii lagbhag aadhi jatiyaan aisi he jinke paripakv yugmakon ke gunasutron kii sankhya kisi sambandhit jati ke yugmakeey gunasutra kii sankhya kii guneet he
 There are many varieties of wheat

 The number of chromosomes is found to be 14, 21,42 and 49 multiplied by 7 among the wheat species
 isi bhanti tambaakoo kii bhinn bhinn jatiyon main gunasutron kii sankhya 12 athwa 12 kii guneet 24 hoti he
 Many polyploids have been formed by use in plants, which have two clusters of unitary formulas

 Such changes are done by the Parliament of India
 inhen sansad ke prayek sadan se paryaapt bahumat ke dwaara anumodan praapt hona chahie or vishisht sanshodhano ko rajyon ke dwaara bhi anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 The details of this procedure are given in article 368, Part XX of the Constitution
 in niyamon ke baavjood 1950 main samvidhan ke lagu hone ke baad se is main 101 sanshodhan kiye ja chuke hai
 Controversially, according to the Supreme Court of India, it is not possible to allow every amendment to be made in the Constitution
 ek sanshodhan is prakaar hona chahie kii yah samvidhan kii "mul saranchana" kaa sammaan kare, jo ki aparivartaneey he
 The proposal for an amendment begins in Parliament where it is introduced as a bill
 iske baad ise sansad ke prayek sadan ke dwaara anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 In each House it should get a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting and a simple majority of all members
 iske baad vishisht sanshodhano ko kam se kam aadhe rajyon kii vidhayikaon ke dwaara bhi anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 Once all other stages are completed, the approval of the President of India is obtained for amendment, but this final phase is only a formality
 samvidhan paryaapt bahumat kii aavashyaktaa ke baavjood, yah duniya main sabase zyada baar sanshodhit kiya jane vaala prashaasak dastavej he; har saal main ausatan do sanshodhan kiye jate hai
 This is partly due to the length and breadth of the constitution
 It is the longest constitution in any of the world than a sovereign nation, with 395 articles and 117000 words
 yah dastavej sarkaar kii shaktiyon ko atyadhik vishisht rup se varnit karata he or isiilie sanshodhano ke liye aksar un maamalon ke saath deal kiya jaataa he, jinhen anya deshon main saamaanya darja diya jaataa he
 The second reason for this is that the Parliament of India is elected by a seat in the district, for this the plurality system used in the United States and the United Nations is used
 iskaa arth yah he ki empi ke samooh ke liye yah sambhav he ki ve do tihaai matdaan hasil kiye bina sansad main do tihaai siten jeet sakate hai

 prayek sanshodhan ko aamtaur par lambaa sheershak diya jaataa he "ek adhinium jo bharat ke samvidhan main sanshodhan karata he"
 The first constitutional amendment was made by the Supreme Court of India in 1967, in the case of Golak Nath Vs State of Punjab
 yah sanshodhan is aadhaar par kiya gaya ki yah anuchhed 13 kaa ulanghan kar rahaa tha, jiske anusaar "rajya koi aisa kanoon nahin banayega jo" main die gaye adhikaron kaa sankshipteekaran karata ho yaa use nasht karata ho
 The term "law" has been interpreted in this article as incorporating amendments to the constitution
 sansad ne choubeeswein sanshodhan ko adhiniyamit karne ke dwaara pratikraya di jiske anusaar "samvidhan ke kisi bhi sanshodhan main kuch bhi lagu nahin hoga
 The current limit in the amendment can be seen in Kesavananda v

 us maamle main supreme court ne kaha ki samvidhan main sanshodhan is prakaar kaa hona chahie ki yah samvidhan kii "mul saranchana" kaa sammaan kare
 is dastavej main kaha gaya ki samvidhan ke vishisht buniyadi lakshanik gunon ko sanshodhan ke dwaara parivartit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 bhartiya sansad ne is seemaa ko hataane kaa prayaas kiya, is ke liye bayalisven sanshodhan kaa adhinium banaaya gaya, jiske anusaar "is samvidhan main xxrep 7

haalanki baad main minerva mills banaam bharat main is parivartan ko sarvocch nyaayalay ke dwaara avaidh ghoshit kiya gaya
 The most important reason for amending the constitution is the deduction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
 ise samvidhan kii anusuchee 9 main moulik adhikaron ke praavdhaan ke vipareet kanoon banaakar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Schedule 9 protects these laws by keeping such laws open only to limited judicial review

 In a landmark judgment in January 2007, the Supreme Court confirmed that all laws would be open to judicial review if they violated the basic structure of the Constitution
 mukhya nyaayadhish yogesh kumaar sabharwal ne kaha "yadi anusuchee 9 main die gaye kanoon mul adhikaron kaa sankshipteekaran karte hai, yaa unhen radd karte hai to iske parinamswaroop samvidhan kii mul saranchana main ulanghan hoga, aise kanoonon ko avaidh qaraar dena chahie

 Amar Singh Rathore was a famous Rajput of the Marwar state
 wo 17veen sadi main bharat ke mogul samraat shah jahaan ke rajdrabari the
 After being deported by his family, he came to the service of the Mughals
 unki prasiddh bahaduree or yuddh kshamta ke parinamswaroop unhen samraat dwaara shahi sammaan or vyaktigat pahchaan mili
 After which he was made the Subedar of Nagaur and later he ruled here
 san 1644 main unki anadhikrut anupasthiti main samraat dwaara karadhaan se naaraaz huye or kar lene ke liye jimmedaar salaabat khan kaa talwaar se galaa kaat diya
 His description is well-known in Rajasthan, western Uttar Pradesh and some folk songs of Punjab
 raja gaj singh mughal shaasha shahjahan ke adheen marwar kshetra ke shaasha the
 His son Amar Singh Rathore was a great warrior and a patriot, but his father had deported him from the kingdom for saving a bandit from the Mughals
 baad main vah shahjahan kii dilli sultanate main shaamil ho gaye jaha unhone shahjahan ko apni veerta se prabhavit kiya
 Which made him the vassal of Nagaur
 haalanki samraat ke bhai salaabat khan, rajya main amar singh rathod ke utthan se jalte the or amar singh ko badnaam karne kaa avasar kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 He soon gets this chance when a few small things come to know about Amar Singh's unauthorized absence
 salaabat khan ne ek mudda ke rup main ise itnaa badha diya ki shahjahan ne salaabat se amar singh ko dand dene kaa aadesh diya
 Taking advantage of this, Salabat threatens Amar Singh and asks him to pay the penalty at the same time
 salaabat ne yah bhi chetavanee di ki vah amar singh ko bina dand kaa bhugtan kiye unhen jane nahin denge
 Amar Singh took out his sword and killed Salabat on the spot
 samraat shahjahan bhi is ghatana se achambhit ho gaye or amar singh ko maarane ke liye apane sainikon kaa aadesh diya
 However, Bahadur Amar showed up his fighting prowess and killed all those who attacked him
 vah jaldi se kile se bhaag gaye or surakshit sthaan par laut gaye
 In the court the next day, the emperor announced that the man who killed Amar Singh would be made a jagirdar, although no one was ready to strike hostility with Amar Singh Rathore, as he had to face Amar Singh's wrath just a day before
 Was
 arjunasingh jo amar singh ke saale the, ne laalach main aakar is chunauti ko sweekaar kar liya
 Arjun Singh told Amarsingh that Shah Jahan realized his mistake and did not want to lose a warrior like Amar Singh
 haalanki amar singh ko shuruyaat main vishwaas nahin tha, parantu jald hi ve arjunasingh ke vishwasghaat kii kala ke jhaanse main aa gaye
 Meanwhile, a small door was erected in front of Shah Jahan's court, so that Amar Singh would have to bow before him to enter the court
 pehle amar ke krityon ko or adaalat main kaarywahi dekhakar, ek utsuk fakir ne samraat se poocha, "ham itane saare yoddhaon vaale hindustan ko kaise jeet sakate hai" shahjahan ne kaha, "ruko or dekhen ki ham kaise karenge "
 Amar was not ready to bow to the emperor and Arjun Singh realized this
 usne amar singh ko pehle pravesh karne kaha
 Amar obeyed his advice, Arjun Singh came from the other side and stabbed a dagger in Amar Singh's chest, Amar Singh got Virgati on him
 to arjunasingh ne unka sar kaata or samraat ke paas le gaya
 The king pointed to the fakir and said "now you know how we got rid of the warriors"
 baad main shahjahan ne arjunasingh ko bhi maar diya
 On notice of Amar Singh's death, Rajput soldiers led by his wife, Bhallu Singh and Ram Singh, attacked the fort where Amar Singh's body lay
 haalanki, hajaaron mughal sainikon ne rajput balon ko gher liya
 Bahadur Rajput forces resisted him until Amar Singh's body was taken away from the fort
 yadhyapi un sabhi rajput ladaakon ne apana jivan mrityu ko samarpit kar diya, lekin ve kabhi bhi mughal sultanate ke saamne jhuke nahin
 Later, the narrow gate in the fort became popularly known as Amar Singh Darwaza as it was a symbol of Rajput bravery over the Muslim army
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa daawa he ki shahjahan ne sthaayee rup se darwaja band karne kaa aadesh diya kyonki yah unhen rajput balon ke haathon se unki haar kii yaad dilaataa tha
 Folklore developed a heartfelt singing style in praise of those Rajput fighters who fought for pride and died with pride
 aaj agra ke kile main aane vaale paryatakon ke liye mukhya dwaar amar singh dwaar hi he

 Physical space is often interpreted as having three linear dimensions, although modern physicists generally consider it, over time, a part of an infinitely four-dimensional continuum called space time
 ganit main 'antariksh' ko vibhinn aadharbhoot sanrachanaon or ayaamon kii vibhinn sankhya ke saath samajha jaataa he
 The concept of space is considered to be very important for understanding the physical universe, although there continues to be disagreement among philosophers about the fact that it is itself an entity, or a relation between units, or a part of the conceptual framework
 parmparik yantriki ke praarambhik vikaas ke dauraan, 17 veen shatabdi main kai darshanik prashn ujagar hue the
 According to Isaac Newton, the space was absolute - meaning it exists permanently and does not depend on whether the space contained any content or not
 anya prakritik darshanik, vishesh rup se gotfrid lebanese, ne iske bajaay sochaa ki antariksh vastuon ke bich sambandhon kaa ek sangrah tha, jo ek duusare se unki duuri or disha ke dwaara diya jaataa he
 In the 18th century, Immanuel Kant described space and time as elements of the structural framework that humans use to build their experience
 19veen or 20veen sadi main ganitagyon ne gaiyr euclidian rekhganit kaa pareekshan karnaa shuru kar diya tha jisamen antariksh ko samtal ke bajaay vakrit kah sakate he
 According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, the space around the gravitational field is incompatible with Euclidean space

 In the seventeenth century, the knowledge of space and time emerged as a central theme of the Enlightenment and Metaphysics
 gotfrid lebanese, german darshanik-ganitagya or isaac newton, angrezi bhautikavigyaani-ganitagya, ne apane dilon main antariksh ke sandarbh main do virdohi siddhanton ko gathan kar liya tha
 Rather than an entity that exists independently of other content, Leibniz stated that space is nothing more than a spatial collection of relations between objects in the world: "space is a space that is gathered together
" Places are the result of "
 Unauthorized space is the space in which objects can be placed and thus may have spatial relationships with other regions
 lebanese ke liye, phir antariksh vishesh vastuon yaa sambhav sthanon ke bich sambandhon kaa adarsh amurtikaran tha tathaa isliye nirantar nahin ho saktaa he, lekin asatat hona chahie
 Space can be thought of as a relationship between family members
 haalanki parivaar ke log ek duusare se sambandhit he phir bhi sambandho kaa astitv logon par nirbhar hota he
 Leibniz argues that space cannot exist without objects in the world because it would mean that there would be a difference between two exactly identical universes in each universe, except the location of the material world
 But since there would be no observed way of saying these universes are separate, there would be some real difference between them according to the unknowable identity
 paryaapt kaaran ke siddhant ke anusaar, antariksh kaa koi bhi siddhant jisamen yah antarnihit he ki ye do brahmad ho sakate he, galat hona chahie
 On the basis of his position on experimentation and observation, Newton considered space to be more than a relation between material objects
 For a relationist there can be no real difference between such inertial motion where the object moves with constant velocity and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes over time because spatial measurement is interrelated with other objects and their speed
 
 lekin newton ne tark diya ki chunki gaiyr jadtviya gati takat utpann karti he, isliye yah purna kiya janaa chahie
 He has used an example of water in a spinning bucket to validate his argument
 ek baaltee pani main ek rassi se lataki hui he or spin hetu set he, yah ek samtal sataha ke saath shuru hota he
 After a while, the surface of the water becomes concave as the bucket continues to spin
 agar baaltee kii katai ko band kar diya jaataa he to pani kii sataha avatal hi bani rahati he kyonki yah spin karti rahati he
 Therefore the concave surface is apparently not the result of the relative motion between the water and the bucket
 iske bajaay newton ne tark diya yah antariksh se paraspar sambandhit gaiyr jadtviya gati kaa ek parinaam hona chahie
 For many centuries the bucket argument was decisive in the case that the existence of space should be independent of content
 atharahavi shatabdi main german darshanik immanuele kant gyaan kaa ek siddhant viksit kiya jisamen antariksh ke bare main gyaan praathmik or synthetic donon ho saktaa he
 According to Kant, knowledge about space is synthetic, in which the statements about space are not correct based on the meaning of the words in the statement
 apni kriti main, kant ne is raay ko asweekaar kar diya ki antariksh yaa to ek padaarth yaa sambandh hona chahie
 Instead, he concluded that space and time were not developed by humans as the characteristic features of the world, but a part of an inevitable well-planned structure to organize our experiences
 euclid ke tatwon main paanch nirvivaad tatv nihit he jo euclidian jyamiti kaa aadhaar he
 One of these, parallel indisputable elements, has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries
 yah nirdhaarit karata he ki kisi samtal jisamen ek sidhi pankti L1 he or ek bindu p he jo L1 par nahin he, us samtal par keval ek sidhi pankti L2 hoti he jo bindu p se hokar guzarati he or sidhi pankti L1 ke samanaantar he
 By the 19th century, some people doubted the veracity of the indisputable element, instead the debate centered on whether it was necessary as a gnome, or whether it was a doctrine that could be derived from other utterances
 haalanki 1830 ke aasapaas, hungarian janos bolai or roosi nikolai evanovich lobachevski ne jyamiti ke ek prakaar par alag granth prakashit kiya jisamen samanaantar nirvivaad tatv, jise atiparavalayik jyamiti kehete he, ko sammilit nahin kiya tha
 In this geometry, there is an infinite parallel line that passes through the p point
 natijatan ek trikon main kone kaa jod 180o se kam hota he tathaa vrutt kii paridhi or iske vyas kaa anupaat pi se adhik hota he
 In the 1850s, Bernhard Riemann developed an equivalent theory of elliptical geometry, in which there are no parallel lines that pass through P
 is jyamiti main, trikon 180o se adhik he or vrutt main paridhi or vyas kaa anupaat pi se kam hota he
 Although there was a Kantian consensus prevailing at the time, when non-euclidean geometry was formalized, some people began to wonder whether the physical space was curved

 Dhanu Graha or Dhanu is the unit of measurement of Hindu length of Vedic period
 ek dhanu grah baraabar hota he chaar angul ke
 Ie 62 mm to 83 mm; vishnu puraana ke anusaar:4 hast= ek dhanush2 dhanush = ek naadika According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
