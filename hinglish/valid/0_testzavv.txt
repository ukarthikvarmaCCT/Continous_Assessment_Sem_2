 Due to the spread of education at the secondary level, the number of students in universities is increasing and the question is whether universities should place all the students who want to study further, or choose only those who are able to benefit from higher education
 The What is the medium of education ?, is also an important question

 All these merchants used to carry logistics to the big kings and emperors of India

 Bhima Nayaka, the son of Seva Lal's father Ramji Nayak, was a very big businessman
 unhen lagbhag bhartiya sabhi bhashaaon kaa gyaan tha
 Their total wealth consisted of 4000 to 5000 cows and bullocks
 jiskaa upyog anaaj kii yatayaat ke liye kiya jaataa tha or wo 52 taandon ke ke nayak the
 He was called Naikada
 a village had a population of around 500
 har tande ke liye ek purush or ek stri gore dharm prachaarak ke rup main kaam karte the, unhen baavann bheru or 64 joganni kehete the
 There used to be a union of these 52 Bheru and 64 Jogani
 or ye mukhya nayakda ke antargat kaayam karte the
 That is why Saint Seva Lal's grandfather was called Ramshagh Nayak
 bhima nayak bhi 52 taandon ke sanghapramukh the
 Historical documents have shown that Bhima Nayak with the British cost 2 lakh rupees
 Had a merchant agreement
 is baat se saaf pataa chalaata he kii, sevaalaal kaa janm vaibhav sapann ghar main hua tha
 Apart from this, a lot of false stories are heard about his birth
 sevaalaal kii maan kaa naam dharamni tha jo ki jairam badtiya kii suputree thi
 After the marriage of Bhima Nayak, he had no child for almost 12 years, later Saint Sevlal was born after the worship of Mother Mother
 sangh ke paramparik niti ke nusaar swaraksha or anaaj kii raksha ke liye yauddhaon kii nirmiti kii jaati thi
 Keeping the same in mind, Sevlal formed a confederation of 7 Sanghatanaikas in which Sevlal himself, his three brothers, Hapa Badu, Pura and Dharmi, Dhaka, Ramsang were also together
 isi sanghatan ko baad main 6 sangh nayakon ne apanaaya
 In this way a federation of 13 people was formed? Which led to 700 Tando comprising of Madhyabharata, Dakshin Bharat
 madhyabhaarat ke vyapaaree bhagavaandaras vadtiya kulsampatti 2 lakh bail) or dakshibharat ke vyapaaree jangi, bhangi bhukiya sevaalaal ke sangh main samavisht hue
 According to the state position of the 17th century, we can say that, the influence and power of the British power was increasing day by day and the system of Indian kings was getting weaker
 angreji hukumat kaa gore banjaaraa vyapaaree par raajaaon ko rasad pahunchane ke khilaaf dabaav badhate ja rahaa tha
 And the British tax-affected Gor Banjara merchants were being charged with tax collection which was against the merchant rules of Gor Banjara
 is kar vasuli ke khilaaf prastaav lekar sevaalaal apane sabhi sangh nayakon ke saath nizaam se milane gayi
 Fearing the British rule, the Nizam turned down the proposal, in view of this Sevlal declared war against the Nizam
 phir hyderabad main yuddh hua or parinamswarup nizaam ne sevaalaal kii sabhi sharte manjur kii or bharat ke anya rajyon ke karpranali ke liye dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ko milane kii salaah di
 Sevlal accepted the Nizam's advice and accepted the honor given by the Nizam
 sammaan ke taur par nizaam ne tamrapatr, talwaar or bhetwastu di
 These Bhetavastuans still exist in the Pohragadh temple
 dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ne is prastaav ko naamanjur kiya, parinaam swarup sevaalaal ne yuddh kaa elaan kiya, gulam khan ke 25000 sainikon kaa muqabla sevaalaal ke 900 yauddhaon ne kiya
 Historians never mentioned this war, Ghulam Khan lost heavily
 gulam khan ne karpranali ko maaf karne ko manjur kiya
 This was a huge political victory for Sevlal from a business point of view
 is jeet ke chalate sevaalaal kaa naam puure bharat varsh main prasiddh hua
 Gaurbanjara of Lahore honored Sevlal
 jaipur ke banjaaraa vyapaaree or bahujan logon kii pukaar par sevaalaal ne bhumia naamak dahshatagrast kaa shirched kiya or rajasthanvaasiyon ko bhumia se mukti dilaai
 Even today, this is a sign of Sevlal's Mandir at Sawai Mansing Hospital in Jaipur
 dilhisthit rysina hill lakishon banjaaraa ne sevaalaal ke swaagat main banaai hui chhatri nehru planitorium, nai dilli main maujuud he
 Similarly, there is still Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in Sevanamak village near Mumbai, where Sevalal Port used to be in the 17th century
 vaise hi dharmtar naam kaa port raigarh jilhe main pen ke paas maujud he
 In the same way, not being Bhaucha in Mumbai, it is Sevabhaya's push
 is jagah par portuguese kaa jahaaj fas gaya tha use sevaalaal ne nikaala, falswarup unhen motiyon kii maala diya gaya, isi vajah se sevaalaal motivalo ke naam se bhi jane jate hai
 Sevlal had a merchant center in the village named Gagode near Paan in Rayagada district where the Mandir of his name still exists
 sevaalaal bahut bade vyapaaree, yauddha, sangatak, arthtajna to the hi lekin uske saath ve bahut bade samajasudharak the
 The strength and wisdom of Sevlal can be ascertained from the fact that the prophecies that Sevlal had about the social and economic and natural state of India are coming true after 250 years

 Famous for their charity and enlightenment in the history of the Zoroastrians, the "camas' brothers invited Dadabhai to partner in their trade
 tadnusaar dadabhai landan or liverpool main unka karyaalay sthapit karne ke liye england gaye
 Leaving the school environment abruptly known as merchant money may be considered a kind of downfall or deviation, but Dada Bhai saw the occasion as suitable for the well-being of students going to higher education in England
 iske saath hi saath unka doosraa uddeshy sarkari prashaskeey sansthaaon kaa adhik se adhik bhartiyakaran karne ke liye andolan chalaane kaa bhi tha

 In those days, the most difficult thing for the aspirants to join the Indian Civil Services was that they had to compete with the British candidates in adverse conditions
 is asuvidha ko dur karne ke liye dada bhai kaa suzav england or bharat main ek saath civil sarvice pariksha karne kaa tha
 For this, he campaigned till 1893 when he struggled there more than as a member of that House in the Lok Sabha and the Assembly accepted the proposal to conduct the examination simultaneously in India and England
 un dinon duusari usase bhi badi parivednaa bharatiyon kii bhayanak daridrata thi
 Although Dadabhai was not the first person who expressed anguish for it, he was the first to launch a movement to eradicate it
 unhone tathyon or aankadon se yah siddh kar diya ki jahaan bhartiya daridrata main aakanth duube the, vahiin bharat kii prashaskeey seva duniyaan main sabase mahangi thi

 On the basis of all these figures, in front of the East India Association, he read the essay "wants and Means on India" on 27 July 1870

 In the end, he decided to make a great effort to attract the attention of world public opinion towards the political slavery and pitiable situation of Indians, which resulted in his magnum opus Poverty and un-british Rule in India
 isamen bahut se lekh, bhaashan, niabandh or ucchadhikariyon se patravyavhaar tathaa samitiyon or aayogon ke samaksh di gai unki gavaahiyaan tathaa kitne hi mahatvapurn adhiniyamon or ghoshnaaon ke uddhran the

 unka yah lakshya yaa dhyey tha bharat kaa kalyaan or unnati jo sansad kii sadsyta ke liye sangharsh karte samay bhi unke mastishk par chaaya rahata tha
 He continued to campaign for the National Congress and in various letters to his friends in India condemned the Zoroastrian tendency to stay away from the national struggle
 koi bhi saptaah aisa nahin bitta tha jisamen unke paas bharat se patr or congress ke sambandh main patrapatrikaon kii kataranen na aati rahi hon tathaa unke patr bhartiya mitron ke paas na pahonchte rahe hon
 Nobody had ever expected that Dadabhai would create such a huge stir in the House of Commons, but his activity and activism in that House seemed as if he had been familiar with the functioning of the house long before

 It is not possible here to describe all the many things that Dadabhai has done for the service of the country in his long life, but it is necessary to discuss the demand made by him in the Calcutta session of the All India Congress for self-government
 unhone apane bhaashan main swarajya ko mukhya sthaan diya
 During his speech, he said, we are not pleading for any grace, we only need justice

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics

 This book of Atal ji has been written as a poetry-epistemology review-song by Madanlal Varma 'krant' in which a very precise analysis is presented using the title of each poem
 avasthaa-samshti nirupan, gatikeey tantron ke kai prakaar ke nirupanon main se ek he
 In fact, it is a time-zone representation and is particularly useful for deliberations concerning the control of multi-input and multi-output dynamic systems
 iske alaava yah araikhik tantron or kaal-parivarti tantron ke vishleshan tathaa sanshleshan ke liye bhi upyogi he
 In this method of system representation, the state variables, inputs and outputs of the system are represented by first-order differential equations
 avasthaa kshetra model main do sameekaran hote hai - avasthaa sameekaran tathaa output sameekaran
 Compared to the frequency-field representation, the state-scale representation has the following advantages: 'avasthaa kshetra' yaa state-spes ek kaalpanik kshetra he jiske aksh avasthaa-char hai
 The state variables of the system in this space can be viewed as a vector
 kisi p input, q output tathaa n avasthaa-charon se yukt tantra ko is paddati main nimnlikhit prakaar se nirupit kiya jaataa he: Where called state vector, and is called output vector, u is called input vector, a is the parent of states, b is the input matrix, c is the output matrix and d All the matrices in the above representation can be variable with time, but if the system is linear and unchanging over time, then these matrices will be unchanging
 char samay t { \ displaystyle t} satat ho saktaa he yaa vivikt 
 In this case, the variable k { \ displaystyle k} is often used instead of time t { \ displaystyle t}
 jin tantron main satat parivarti tathaa vivikt rup se parivartit hone vaale avyav hote hai unako sankar tantra kehete hai
 Therefore, in different situations the form of the state-space model will be of the following type: kisi tantra ke avasthaa char uske puraane avasthaaon evam inputon se nirdhaarit hote hai
 In fact, if the old state x and input u are known over time, then the value of x can be calculated: us tantra ko niyantraneey kehete hai jisko, sweekaarya inputon ke madhyam se, kisi ek avasthaa se duusari avasthaa main simit samay main le jaaya ja saktaa he
 a continuous, time-invariant, linear state-model will be controllable if and only if- jahaan 'rank' kaa arth kisi matrix kii raikhik rup se swatantra panktiyon kii sankhya he
 That system is called 'observable' whose internal states can be calculated after knowledge of the outputs
 koi satat, kaal-aparivarti, raikhik avasthaa-model prekshniya hoga, yadi or keval yadi- The summary of the above discussion is that the meaning of control is that the input required to move that system from one state to another in a limited time is possible
 prekshaniyata kaa arth yah he ki yadi kisi tantra ke output gyaat hone par aanatarik avasthaaen nikaali ja saktin hai

 rajnay ko anterrashtriya sandhi vaarta karne kaa amoort gun yaa kushalta bhi maan liya jaataa he
 Its most corrupt use is when it is taken in a fraudulent act
 is prakaar rajnay shabd vibhinn arthon main prayeg kiye jane ke kaaran pathak ke man main bhram utpann kar detaa he
 Perhaps the term is most confusing in political science
 is vishay main aargensky ne kaha he ki 'kushalta, chaturaai evam kapat’ sareekhe gun ek achche rajnay ke lakshan ho sakate hai kintu inhen rajnay ko paribhaashit karne vaali visheshta nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Not even equivalent to diplomatic foreign policy
 yah videsh niti kaa aisa ang he jo uski rachana or kriyanviti main sakriy yogadan karata he
 ' argenski ke ansaar- According to Sir Ernest Saints, is sambandh main paamar tathaa parkins ne yah jigyaasa prakat kii he ki yadi rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon main buddhi or chaaturya kaa abhaav he to kya rajnay asambhav hoga ? spasht he ki rajnay do athwa do se adhik swatantra rajyon ke madhya sthit sambandh he tadnusaar prayek rajya buddhi, kushalta evam chaaturya kaa prayog karata he
 In the words of KM Panikkar, quinci rhite ne rajnay ko do arthon main paribhaashit kiya he - lokapriy arth main tathaa vishesh arth main
 In the popular sense - is paribhaasha kii khaas baat yah he ki lokapriy arth main rajnay ko aisi sandhi-vaarta mana gaya he jo dabaav par nahin varan samajhane-bujhane par aadhaarit rahati he
 In its special sense, diplomats have been considered devotional towards the national interest
 raajnneeti shaastra main rajnay kaa lokapriy arth lagu nahin hota
 In international relations, diplomacy only works where there is a possibility of pressure
 rajnay dwaara in sambhaawanaaon ko dabaaya jaataa he
 The purpose of diplomacy is to make agreements and agreements are made only where there are some disagreements
 ye asahmatiyaan aisi honi chaiye jinamein vaarta dwaara sahmati kaayam kii ja sake
 Diplomacy is irrelevant in areas of absolute consensus and it is ineffective in areas of absolute disagreement
 rabrto regela ke anusaar rajnay shabd kaa kaaphi durupyog hua he
 Actually, diplomacy is a profession that involves many activities
 yah duniya ke aise kuch vyavsaayon main se ek he jisaki paridhi main maanviya kriya kii prayek shakha shaamil ho jaati he
 Its power politics is related to the struggle of economic power and ideologies
 regela rajnay ko ‘samjhauta vaarta kii kala’ maanata he
 In 1796, Edmund Burke, while defining diplomacy, wrote that diplomacy is the operation or operation of international relations
 george epa0 kenon kaa kahana he ki takneekee arth main rajnay kii vyavastha sarkaron ke bich sampark ke rup main kii ja sakati he
 Thus, different thinkers have given different definitions of diplomacy
 ye sabhi paribhaashayen purnatah upyukt nahin hai kyonki samay tathaa paristhitiyon main parivartan ke saath-saath rajnay kaa arth bhi badalata rahata he
 Many thinkers have considered diplomacy not only as an occupation but also an art
 adhikansh sarkarein apane hiton kii prapti evam abhivruddhi ke liye ise apnaane lagi he
 It is gradually becoming an effective means of peace
 shuru main rajya aseemit shaktiyon se sampann hote the faltah rajanyagyaan ko samprabhu mana jaataa tha
 They were given enough freedom to work
 is swatantraaa kaa anya kaaran yah tha ki us samay sanchaar ke drutagami sadhano kaa abhaav tha
 This widespread independence of diplomats began to be limited in the late 19th century
 us samay rajnay kii ek anya visheshta yah bhi thi ki rajanyagnon ko unke kaary se sambandhit aadesh tathaa nirdesh dekar hi bheja jaataa tha
 Nowadays it has not been necessary due to the convenience of rapid means of communication
 rajnay ko kuch log ek rahasypurna vyavsaay maanate hai
 this is not right
 hoodh gibason ke anusaar, ”asal main rajnay ek bhramasadhy vyavsaay he
 It is beyond magic or mystery
 ise kisi bhi anya sarkari kaary kii bhaanti ek gambheer vyavsaay ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Palmer and Parikans have described some features of diplomacy
 ye visheshtayen rajnay ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye upyogi siddh hogi
 These features are the following: - nickelson kaa yah kahana thik nahin he ki yuddh armbh hone par rajanyik kaary band ho jate hai, kyonki paamar or parkins ke vichaar se rajanyagnon kaa kaary desh kii raksha karnaa he
 Therefore, during the war, they do not sit hand in hand, but at that time they cooperate in military work
 is prakaar yudhkaal main rajanyagnon kaa kaary rukta nahin, balki unke kaary kaa rup badal jaataa he
 During wartime, the work of diplomacy increases
 pichley do vishwayudhon kii ghatnaon ke avlokan se yah baat spasht ho jaati he
 To understand the nature of diplomacy, it is useful to study its relation and difference with foreign policy, international law and diplomatic politics
 pracheen bharat ke rajwanshon va rajyon main rajnay kii sudeergh parampara rahi he
 The earliest work on statecraft and diplomacy is Arthashastra, the credit of which goes to Kautilya, the principal adviser to Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya dynasty
 arthshaastra rajtv kii kala par ek sampurna rachana he
 It also has the principles of diplomacy, which describes how intelligent kings form alliances between mutually competitive states and put their enemies in stalemate
 us samay rajdarbaron ko bheje gayi doot deergh kaal tak rukaa karte the
 There are instructions in economics dealing with messengers
 kaha he ki - raja ke liye sabase badi naitikta he ki uskaa rajya samruddhi ko praapt kare aadi
 The policy to carry out the national program is 'policy'
 yah aantarik athwa bahari kisi bhi ho sakati he
 Internal policy is related to home affairs whereas foreign policy is related to the external arrangements of the nation
 videsh niti or rajnay, raajnneeti ke ve pahiye hai jinaki sahaayta se anterrashtriya raajnneeti chalati he
 Foreign policy is the fulfillment of its objectives in relation to other states by a nation
 aisi videsh niti ke bare main sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa jo rashtriya hiton kii upeksha karen
 Therefore, foreign policy is interpreted as the behavior of the state through which states fulfill their interests
 arvachin yug main koi rajya apane aap main parthaky kii niti apanaakar alag rah saken, yah sarvatha asambhav he
 Foreign policy is made with much thought because the future of the state depends only on its right decision
 videsh niti ke nirmaan main rajya ko kai tatwon kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 For example, the foreign policy of Britain and Japan has been deeply influenced by its geographical location
 rajyon ke prakritik strot athwa unka samrik mahatv aadi rajya kii videsh niti ko prabhavit karte hai
 Underdeveloped states, which continue to receive assistance from various powers and depend on them, can never form an independent foreign policy
 kisi desh kii sainik shakti uski videsh niti ko utsaahi banaakar galat maarg par le jaati he
 Germany, Italy and Japan invaded their neighboring states due to military power and called for world war
 rajyon kii raajnneeti tathaa unki videsh niti kaa nirmaan desh ke rajaneta karte hai, to rajdoot iskaa kriyanyavan
 In determining foreign policy, states have to take into account many perspectives of national and international situations
 jaise rajya kii bhugolic sthiti, aarthik aavashyaktaaen, prakritik strot, pratiraksha kii aavashyaktaaen tathaa sandhiyaan aadi
 Through this, efforts are made to make the adversary or enemy side powerless or the friendly state even more enigmatic
 videsh niti ke madhyam se rajyon ke madhya santulan banaaye rakhane athwa samuhik suraksha aadi ke kadam uthaaye jate hai
 The basic mantra of foreign policy is 'enemy of enemy is friend'
 china ne isi niti ke antargat bharat ke shatru pakistan ke saath maitri sambandh banaaye the
 Similarly, the objective of foreign policy is also to establish 'neutral borders'
 seemaa ke prashn ko lekar rajyon ke madhya sambandh praayah bigadate hai
 There has been a situation of war or war between countries like india-pakistan, india-china, russia-china etc
 rajyon kii aarthik sthiti, vyapaar or vaanijya aadi ke sandarbh main bhi videshniti ke nirnay liye jate hai
 States sometimes lose their right to free decisions in their efforts to attain power
 rajya kii videsh niti ke nirnay uski samrik sthiti tathaa sainik shakti par nirnay karte hai
 The more powerful the state is, the more successful its diplomacy will be
 fradrik mahaan ke anusaar,” shakti bina rajnay thik vaisaa hi he jaisaa vaadun bina sangeet
 “united States diplomacy is successful only because of its power
 yadi koi rajya nirbal ho to vah swayan anya rajyon kaa us desh main hastkshep athwa akraman kaa nimantran detaa he
 The partition of Poland, the making of Italy a European destination, the merger of Austria and Czechoslovakia by Hitler and the invasion of China by India, were possible due to the powerless states
 niti nirmaataaon dwaara apane uddeshyon ko nirdhaarit karne ke pashchaat rajya ke samaksh in uddeshyon kii prapti kaa prashn aata he or yahi rajnay kaa prabhaav drushtigochar hota he
 The state can be active or passive in the field of foreign policy
 yadi rajya sakriy he to rajya ke samaksh chaar vikalp hote hai, jiske aadhaar par vah kaary karata he - raajnneetik aarthik, manovaigyanik tathaa sainik
 Depending on the time and situation, the state can adopt any one of these options or can use its combined form
 niskriyata vartmaan anterrashtriya paristhitiyon main kisi bhi rajya ke liye ghaatak siddh ho sakati he
 States often use the path of diplomacy
 videsh niti kaa uddeshy mitra rajyon ke saath sambandhon ke adhik pragadh or shatru paksh ko niskriy bananaa hota he
 Diplomacy is the tool that helps in achieving this objective through dialogue and cleverness
 videsh niti ke uddeshyon kii prapti kaa sarvocch evam mahatvapurn saadhan hi he
 In fact, foreign policy is the skill of diplomacy
 kisi bhi videsh niti kaa nirmaan in adhikariyon kaa kaary he, vahi duusare deshon ke sandarbh main iskaa kriyanvayan rajdooton kaa
 In this complex era of today, even though technically, the State Department alone is considered to be the creator of foreign policy, it cannot be denied that ambassadors also contribute significantly in its construction
 rajdoot kii gatividhiyaan uske desh kii videsh niti par aadhaarit rahati he
 Although it is true that ambassadors are not independent in its operation
 videsh niti or rajnay ek-duusare ke paryaay nahin hai
 Some scholars use them in place of each other in a bond-free manner
 inamen paryaapt antar he
 Foreign policy involves efforts to protect the interests of nations, establish relations between them and maintain them
 je0aar0 childs ke anusaar “kisi bhi desh kii videsh niti uske vaideshik sambandhon kaa saar he” jabaki “rajnay vah prakriya he jisaki sahaayta se videsh niti karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 "in the words of Sir Charles Waxter," Most of the assumptions of policy are meaningless even if there is no means to convert them into action
 ” yah kaary rajnay karata he The diplomatic relations between the states have been going on since time immemorial
 ye utane hi pracheen hai jitne ki rajya
 In Greece, Rome, and ancient India, diplomatic relations were very extensive, and the rules determining these relations were also formulated
 puraane rajnay kaa arth pracheen kaaleen rajnay se kadaapi nahin he
 This refers to the diplomacy prevalent in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
 richalu dwaara pratipaadit va callears dwaara vyakhyayit rajnay ko, jise puraane rajnay kii sangya di jaati he, saare europe ne sweekaar kiya tha
 This diplomacy ran successfully on the basis of secrecy until the eighteenth century
 1919 ke purv kaa rajnay purana rajnay tha
 The period between the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 and the First World War of 1914 was a golden period of prestigious diplomacy
 yah nishchit niyamon se bandhaa tha
 The diplomacy of this time was based on chivalry, experience and objectivity
 yah vishwaas, spashtataa or yatharth ko safal rajnay kaa aadhaar maanata tha
 The talks were held in secret

 The talks continued slowly

 yadhyapi 1919 main rajnay kii sthiti main parivartan aayaa, kintu 1919 kaa varsh vastav main koi vibhaajak rekha nahin he
 According to Nicholson, this has only happened that diplomacy has changed itself according to the new changing circumstances
 jules camban kaa bhi mat tha ki puraane tathaa nae rajnay ke madhya bhed bhram he
 Regala is of the opinion that even though the method of working has changed, modern new diplomacy is still adopting many qualities of old diplomacy
 rajnay ek nirantar gatisheel vyavastha he
 The basis of its ideas and principles today is the experience of hundreds of years
 ve, jinhone puraane rajnay kii katu aalochana kii or nayi vyavastha ko sweekaar kiya, jaisaa raashtrapati vilson ne kiya tha, unhen bhi sheeghra hi puraani vyavastha par phir aana padaa tha
 In this era of open diplomacy, treaty negotiations still operate in secret
 itnaa sab kuch likhane ke baad bhi is baat se nakaara nahin ja saktaa he ki yadhyapi tailoran or bismark tathaa kisinger ke dwaara prayukt rajnay ke sadhano main vibhaajan rekha khinchi ja sakati he, tathaapi rajanyik vichaardhaara main krantikari parirvatan aaye hai
 Today, diplomacy is run by the people and their representatives, not by a few select people, the kings and emperors or their beloved characters

 ek parmaanu kisi bhi saadhaaran se padaarth kii sabase choti ghatak ikai he jisame ek rasinic tatv ke gun hote hai
 Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is made up of neutral or ion atoms
 parmaanuon bahut chote hai; vishisht aakaar lagbhag 100 pm hai
 However, atoms do not have well-defined boundaries, and they have different methods for defining their shapes that give different but quite close values
 parmaanuon itane chote he ki shastreey bhautikee iskaa kaafii galat parinaam dete hai
 Each atom is made up of nuclei and the nucleus is limited by one or more electrons

 Protons and neutrons in the nucleus attract each other by a different force, i

 atomic force, which is generally stronger than the electromagnetic force in which positively charged protons are repelling from each other

 The electrons with negative charge revolve around the nucleus, which is called the electron cube
 nabhik, dhanatmak aavesh vaale protaanon evam anaveshit neutranon se bana hota he
 When the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus, the atom is electrically charged; Otherwise, the atom is in the form of positively charged or negative ion
