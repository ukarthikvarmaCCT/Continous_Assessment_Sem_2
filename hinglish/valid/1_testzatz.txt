 Since Keshavdas Khatri was respected among the Marathas and Malhar Rao Holkar also believed in him, after the battle of Rajmahal, Hargovind Natani seduced the king that Keshavdas Khatri joined the Marathas from within and attacked Jaipur ' 'it is happening, Ishwari Singh, one day convinced Keshavdas Khatri to get him poisoned and killed without believing that Natani was unconfirmed

 Kavishiromani Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri has expressed these expressions in an appreciative poem using the exaggerated ornament about this monument in Jaipur Vaibhavam - "the gold vase whose upper dome is hugging sky like height due to the gods

 He died untimely at the age of 22 in Mathura
 The cause of Shiv Singh's death has been told by the famous writer of 'vansh Bhaskar' that the middle son "sawai Jaisingh had poisoned his son with the help of his queen on the instigation of Ishwar Singh", but like Yadunath Sarkar Historians consider it a 'gapp' and do not accept it

" Apart from Ishwari Singh, funerals of all Jaipur kings were held in the ghatris, but "they were secretly set on fire around the palace complex
" " In the place where he was cremated, today, the palace of Maharaja Sawai Ishwari Singh, situated in front of the Tal-bowl pond in Jaipur, is standing on a round dome, four pillars built in eight angles above and below, in the inner part of which the artistic bell- Boote and eight murals are made

 haalanki unhone safaltaapurvak 1980 main bihar vidhansabha chunaav ladaa or bihar vidhaan sabha ke sadsy bane
 During this period Yadav grew in hierarchy and was considered one of the leaders of the other party
 1985 main vah bihar vidhansabha ke liye phir se nirvaachit hue the
 After the death of former Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur, Prasad became the leader of the opposition Bihar Legislative Assembly in 1989
 usee varsh, vah ve
pi
 singh sarkaar ke tahat lok sabha ke liye bhi chune gaye the
 As of 1990, Prasad represented the largest castes of the Yadavas with 11
7% of the state's population, establishing himself as a low-caste leader
 duusari taraf bihar main musalmaan paramparaagat rup se congress vot bank ke rup main karyrat the, lekin 1989 ke bhagalpur hinsa ke baad unhone prasad ke prati apni vafadari badal di
 Over a period of 10 years, he became a formidable force in the politics of Bihar state, known for his popularity among Muslim and Yadav voters
 1990 main ve bihar ke mukhyamantri bane evam 1995 main bhi baari bahumat se vijayi rahe
 On 23 September 1990, Prasad arrested LK Advani in Samastipur during the Ram Rath Yatra, and presented himself as a secular leader
 1990 ke dashak main aarthik morche par vishwa bank ne apane kaary ke liye apni party kii saraahna kii
 In 1993, Prasad adopted an English-language policy and pushed for the re-introduction of English as a language in the school curriculum, in contrast to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, another Yadav and caste-based politician

 He is also the President of Bihar Cricket Association

 giraftaar tay ho jane ke baad lalu ne mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya or apni patni rabari devi ko bihar kaa mukhyamantri banane kaa faisla kiya
 When there was a problem in getting Rabri's trust vote, the Congress and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha supported her

 When the assembly was elected two years later, the RJD was reduced to a minority
 saat dinon ke liye nitish kumaar kii sarkaar bani parantu vah chal nahin paayi
 Once again Rabri Devi became the Chief Minister
 congress ke 22 vidhayak unki sarkaar main mantri bane
 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Lalu Prasad once again came into the role of "king Maker" and became a railway minister
 yadav ke kaarykaal main hi dashakon se ghate main chal rahi rail seva phir se phaayde main ai
 The rejuvenation of Indian Railways became a subject of research due to the efficient management of Lalu Yadav in all major management institutes in India as well as business schools across the world
 lekin agle hi saal 2005 main bihar vidhansabha chunaav main rajd sarkaar haar gai or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unki party ke keval chaar saansad hi jeet sake
 The result was that Lalu did not find a place in the central government
 samay-samay par lalu ko bachaane vaali congress bhi is baar unhen nahin bachaa nahin paayi

 The Airbus industry began as a consortium of European aeronautical establishments to compete with American companies such as Boeing, mcdonnell Douglas and Lockheed
 haalanki anek europea vayuyan unnat the, phir bhi sarvaadhik safal vayuyanon kii utpaadan khapat bhi kam thi
 In 1991, the then CEO and managing director of the Airbus industry, Jean Pearson, described a number of factors explaining the dominance of American aircraft producers: the geographic expansion of the United States made air transportation a preferred travel option; The 1942 anglo-american Agreement handed over production of transport aircraft to the US; And World War II gave America a "profitable, powerful, powerful and structured aeronautical industry"
 "for the purpose of strengthening European co-operation in the field of aviation technology and thereby promoting economic and technological progress in Europe, to take appropriate measures for the joint development and production of an airbus
" In the mid-1960s, experimental negotiations began in the context of the European Cooperative Proposal

 Following the tri-government agreement in 1967, Roger Betili was appointed technical director of the A300 development project
 betili ne ek shram-vibhaajan viksit kiya, jo aane vaale varshon main airbas ke utpaadan ke liye aadhaar banane ja rahaa tha: frans ko cockpit, udaan niyantran or vimaanakbandh ke nimna kendriya bhaag kaa utpaadan karnaa tha; hoker sidli, jisaki trident praudyogiki ne unhen prabhavit kiya, ko pankhons kaa vikaas karnaa tha; germany ko vimaanakbandh ke agle or pichley bhaag or saath hi upree kendriya bhaag kaa vikaas karnaa chaiye; flap or spoiller kaa nirmaan dach karanevaale the; antat spain ko vayuyan kii kshaitij poonch kaa nirmaan karnaa tha
 On 26 September 1967, the German, French and British governments signed a memorandum of understanding in London, which allowed development studies to continue

 Given the airlines' mixed support towards the 300+ seater Airbus A300, the partners proposed the A250, which later became the A300B, a 250-seater aircraft powered by pre-available engines

 "we showed the world we were not sitting on a nine-day wonder, and that we wanted to realize a family of planes

 The League's success was initially bad, but, in part, due to the marketing prowess used by Airbus CEO Bernard Lathier to target airlines from the United States and Asia, the number of orders for airplanes increased
 1979 tak sangh ke paas A300 ke liye 256 order the, or pichley varsh airbas ne ek adhik unnat vayuyan, A310, kaa vimochan kiya tha
 The release of the A320 in 1981 guaranteed Airbus' reputation as a major player in the aircraft market - 400 orders had been received prior to the first flight of the aircraft compared to 15 orders received for the A300 in 1972
 prabhavi saajhedaar companiyon dwaara utpaadan or ejineering parisampattiyon ko roak liye jane ke kaaran airbas industry ek vikray or vipanan company ban gai
 Inefficiencies arose from this arrangement as the four partner companies had to contend with the inherent benefits of it; She was both a subcontractor of the union and a shareholder of the GIE

 It was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary alliance for the production of just one aircraft, as mentioned in its original mission document, but rather it was now a long-term development for future aircraft
 The brand was created

 In the early 1990s, the then CEO of Airbus, Jean Pearson, argued that GIE should be scrapped and Airbus should be established as a traditional company
 haalanki, chaar companiyon kii parisampattiyon ke ekikaran or moolyankan kii kathinaayee or saath hi kanoonee muddon ne is pahal ko vilambit kar diya
 In December 1998, when it was reported that British Aerospace and DASA were close to a merger, Aerospaceal crippled the ongoing negotiations over the conversion of Airbus; The French company feared that a joint bae / DASA, which would hold 57
9% ownership in Airbus, would dominate the company and urged a 50 / 50 split
 haalanki, jab marconi electronic systams ke saath vilay karke BAE systams ke nirmaan ko praathamikta dete hue bae ne DASA ke saath janvari 1999 main apni baatcheet roak di, to yah mudda sulajh gaya
 Subsequently, the process was simplified with the creation of EADS by merging three of the four partner companies in 2000

 The decision resulted in Boeing filing a formal complaint, and canceling the KC-X contract to start the auction afresh

 Although both producers have a wide product range in various segments ranging from single-corridor to extensive infrastructure, their aircraft do not always compete directly
 Instead, they give feedback by presenting slightly larger or slightly smaller models to each other to take advantage of any holes in demand and to get a better edge
 udhaaharan ke liye, A380 ko 747 se bhi bada banaaya gaya he
 The A350 XWB competes with the higher version of the 787 and the lower version of the 777
 A320, 737-700 se bada, lekin 737-800 se chota he
 The A321 is larger than the 737-900, but smaller than the previous 757-200

 It is anticipated that the A380 will further reduce sales of the Boeing 747 by increasing Airbus' share of the much larger aircraft market, although repeated delays in the A830 program have led many consumers to consider the rebuilt 747-8 Is forced to tezi se bik rahe bowing 787 kaa muqaabala karne ke liye ek pratispardhi model kaa utpaadan karne hetu airlinon kii ore se badhate dabaav ke kaaran airbas ne A350 XWB kaa prastaav bhi diya he

 In July 2004, Boeing CEO Harry Stoncifer accused Airbus of violating the 1992 bilateral EU-US agreement providing discipline for large civilian aircraft support from governments
 Airbus is provided with reimbursement start-up investment by the US and European governments, called "initial aid", in which the money is returned with interest and indefinite royalties, but only if the aircraft has been commercially successful
 airbas kaa daawa he ki yah pranali 1992 ke samjhaute or WTO niyamon kaa puri tarah paalan karti he
 The agreement allows for up to 33 percent of the cost of the program to be met by government loans, which are required to be fully repaid within 17 years with interest and royalties

 a fluid is released from the periphery of the jug which attracts insects
 baithte hi keedaa andar phisal jaataa he or vahaan mar jaataa he

 To avoid the confusion caused by the ambiguity of sin − 1, the reciprocals and inverses of trigonometric functions are often displayed as in this table
 In representing the cosecant function, the longer form 'cosec' is sometimes used in place of 'csc'
 Different angular measures can be appropriate in different situations
 This table shows some of the more common systems
radians is the default angular measure and is the one you use if you use the exponential definitions
 All angular measures are unitless
 From the two identities above, the following table can be extrapolated
 Note however that these conversion equations may not provide the correct sign
 For example, if sin θ = 1 / 2, the conversion in the table indicates that cos ⁡ θ = 1 - sin 2 ⁡ θ = 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ cos \ theta \ , = \ , { \ sqrt { 1- \ sin ^ {2} \ theta}} = { \ sqrt {3}} / 2}, though it is possible that cos ⁡ θ = - 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ cos \ theta \ , = \ , - { \ sqrt {3}} / 2}
 More information would be needed about which quadrant θ lies in to determine a single, exact answer
 Rarely used today, the versine, coversine, haversine, and exsecant have been defined as below and used in navigation, for example the haversine formula was used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere
 By examining the unit circle, we can establish the following properties of trigonometric functions: When the trigonometric functions are reflected from certain values of θ { \ displaystyle \ theta }, The result is often one of the other trigonometric functions
 This leads to the following identities: By shifting the function round by certain angles, it is often possible to find different trigonometric functions that express the result more simply
 Some examples of this are given shown by shifting functions round by π / 2, π and 2π radians
 Because the periods of these functions are either π or 2π, there are cases where the new function is exactly the same as the old function without the shift

 These can be proved very easily with the help of Euler's formula
 x ± y = a ± b ⇒ x + y = a + b and x − y = a − b { \ displaystyle { \ begin{aligned}x \ pm y=a \ pm b& \ Rightarrow \ x+y=a+b \ \ &{ \ mbox{and}} \ x-y=a-b \ end{aligned}}} x ± y = a ∓ b ⇒ x + y = a − b and x − y = a + b { \ displaystyle { \ begin{aligned}x \ pm y=a \ mp b& \ Rightarrow \ x+y=a-b \ \ &{ \ mbox{and}} \ x-y=a+b \ end{aligned}}} where "| a | = k" means the index a runs through the set of all subsets of size k of the set {1, 2, 3, 


}
 In these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many terms: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors and cofinitely many cosine factors
 If only finitely many of the terms θi are nonzero, then only finitely many of the terms on the right side will be nonzero because sine factors will vanish, and in each term, all but finitely many of the cosine factors will be unity

 If x, y, and z are the three angles of any triangle, or in other words as tan either increases through positive values or decreases through negative values
 This is a one-point compactification of the real line
) Essentially this is Ptolemy's theorem adapted to the language of trigonometry
 For some purposes it is important to know that any linear combination of sine waves of the same period but different phase shifts is also a sine wave with the same period, but a different phase shift
 In the case of a linear combination of a sine and cosine wave, we have where More generally, for an arbitrary phase shift, we have where and Sum of sines and cosines with arguments in arithmetic progression: For any a and b: where arctan is the generalization of arctan which covers the entire circular range
 The above identity is sometimes convenient to know when thinking about the Gudermanian function
 If x, y, and z are the three angles of any triangle, ie if x + y + z = π, then where i2 = −1
 Template: split-sectionoccasionally one sees the notation i
e
 "cis" abbreviates "cos& +& i& sin"
 Though at first glance this notation is redundant, being equivalent to eix, its use is rooted in several advantages
 This notation was more common in the post WWII era when typewriters were used to convey mathematical expressions
superscripts are both offset vertically and smaller than 'cis' or 'exp'; hence, they can be problematic even for hand writing
 For example e ix2 versus cis versus exp
 For many readers, cis is the clearest, easiest to read of the three
 The cis notation is sometimes used to emphasize one method of viewing and dealing with a problem over another
 The mathematics of trigonometry and exponentials are related but not exactly the same; exponential notation emphasizes the whole, whereas cis and cos & + & i & sin notations emphasize the parts
 This can be rhetorically useful to mathematicians and engineers when discussing this function, and further serve as a mnemonic
 The cis notation is convenient for math students whose knowledge of trigonometry and complex numbers permit this notation, but whose conceptual understanding doesn't yet permit the notation e ix
 As students learn concepts that build on prior knowledge, it is important not to force them into levels of math they are not yet prepared for
 In some contexts, the cis notation may serve the pedagogical purpose of emphasizing that one has not yet proved that this is an exponential function
 In doing trigonometry without complex numbers, one may prove the two identities Similarly in treating multiplication of complex numbers, one may observe that the real and imaginary parts of the product of c1& +& is1 and c2& +& is2 are respectively Thus one sees this same pattern arising in two disparate contexts: This coincidence can serve as a motivation for conjoining the two contexts and thereby discovering the trigonometric identity and observing that this identity for cis of a sum is simpler than the identities for sin and cos of a sum
 Having proved this identity, one can challenge the students to recall which familiar sort of function satisfies this same functional equation The answer is exponential functions
 That suggests that cis may be an exponential function Then the question is: what is the base b? The definition of cis and the local behavior of sin and cos near zero suggest that 
 Thus the rate of change at 0 is i, so the base should be ei
 Thus if this is an exponential function, then it must be For applications to special functions, the following infinite product formulæ for trigonometric functions are useful: The Gudermannian function relates the circular and hyperbolic trigonometric functions without resorting to complex numbers; see that article for details
 The curious identity is a special case of an identity that contains one variable: a similar-looking identity is and in addition The following is perhaps not as readily generalized to an identity containing variables: Degree measure ceases to be more felicitous than radian measure when we consider this identity with 21 in the denominators: The factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 may start to make the pattern clear: they are those integers less than 21 / 2 that are relatively prime to 21
 The last several examples are corollaries of a basic fact about the irreducible cyclotomic polynomials: the cosines are the real parts of the zeroes of those polynomials; the sum of the zeroes is the Möbius function evaluated at 21; only half of the zeroes are present above
 The two identities preceding this last one arise in the same fashion with 21 replaced by 10 and 15, respectively
 An efficient way to compute π is based on the following identity without variables, due to Machin: or, alternatively, by using Euler's formula: With the golden ratio φ: Also see exact trigonometric constants
 In calculus the relations stated below require angles to be measured in radians; the relations would become more complicated if angles were measured in another unit such as degrees
 If the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of geometry, their derivatives can be found by verifying two limits
 The first is: verified using the unit circle and squeeze theorem
 It may be tempting to propose to use l'hôpital's rule to establish this limit
 However, if one uses this limit in order to prove that the derivative of the sine is the cosine, and then uses the fact that the derivative of the sine is the cosine in applying l'hôpital's rule, one is reasoning circularly — a logical fallacy 
 The second limit is: verified using the identity tan = ) / sin
 Having established these two limits, one can use the limit definition of the derivative and the addition theorems to show that sin′ = cos and cos′ = −sin
 If the sine and cosine functions are defined by their Taylor series, then the derivatives can be found by differentiating the power series term-by-term
 The rest of the trigonometric functions can be differentiated using the above identities and the rules of derivative: The integral identities can be found in "list of integrals of trigonometric functions"
 The fact that the differentiation of trigonometric functions results in linear combinations of the same two functions is of fundamental importance to many fields of mathematics, including differential equations and fourier transformations
 The Dirichlet kernel Dn is the function occurring on both sides of the next identity: The convolution of any integrable function of period 2π with the Dirichlet kernel coincides with the function's nth-degree Fourier approximation
 The same holds for any measure or generalized function
 yadi ham Keep it, jahaan eix or cis ek hi cheez hai
 The above formulas are useful in integrating the rational functions of sin and cos into the calculus

 Stating the nature of the world, it is said that - arthath naam evam rup se vyaakrit, anek karta, anek bhokta se sanyukt, jisamen desh, kaal, nimitt or kriyafal bhi niyat hai
 The world whose creation cannot be imagined by the mind, the origin, the position and the rhythm of the world, it is called Brahm

 He removed the religious evils prevailing in the then India and illuminated the country with the light of Advaita Vedanta
 sanathan dharm kii raksha hetu unhone bharat main chaaron dishaao main chaar mathon kii sthapana kii tathaa shankaracharya pad kii sthapana karke us par apane chaar pramukh shishyon ko asin kiya
 Jyotirmath in the north, Shringeri in the south, Govardhan in the east and Sharda Math in the west established four dhams in the country
 32 saal kii alpaayu main pavitra kedaar nath dham main sharir tyaag diya
 Shankaracharya is known as Adi Guru with respect in the whole country
 ek sanyasi balak, jisaki aayu maatr 7 varsh thi, gurugrih ke niyamanusaar ek brahman ke ghar bhiksha maangane pahunchaa
 There was not even a grain of food in the house of that Brahmin to give alms
 brahman patni ne us balak ke haath par ek aanwala rakhaa or rote hue apni vipannataa kaa varnan kiya
 Seeing his condition, the heart of that love-pity idol child was moved
 vah atyant aart swar main maan lakshmi kaa stotra rachakar us param karunamayi se nirdhan brahman kii vipadaa harne kii prarthana karne laga
 Pleased at his request, Mahalakshmi rained gold amla in the house of that poor poor Brahmin
 jagat janani mahalakshmi ko prasann kar us brahman parivaar kii daridrata dur karne vaala, dakshin ke kaladi gram main janma vah balak tha- ‘'shankar'’, ji aage chalakar '‘jagadguru shankaracharya'’ ke naam se vikhyath hua
 Lord Shankar himself incarnated on this earth in the form of this great scholar Shaktipunj child
 inke pita shivguru nampudri ke yahan vivaah ke kai varshon baad tak jab koi santan nahin hui, tab unhone apni patni vishishtadevi ke saath putr prapti kii kaamana se dirghakaal tak chandramauli bhagwaan shankar kii kathor aradhana kii
 After all, Lord Shankar appeared in a dream and was pleased and said, 'ask for the groom
 ’ shivguru ne apane isht guru se ek dderghaayu sarvajna putr maanga
 Lord Shankar said- 'watts, longevity son will not be omniscient and omniscient son will not have longevity
 bolo tum kaisaa putr chaahate ho?’ tab dharmapraan shastrasevi shivguru ne sarvajna putr kii yachana kii
 Lord Shiva again said - 'watts you will get an omniscient son

 ' kuch samay ke pashchaat i
 san 686 main baishakh shukla panchami ke din madhyakaal main vishishtadevi ne param prakashrup ati sundar, divya kaantiyukt balak ko janm diya
 Devgn Brahmins reflected the chakra symbol on the forehead of the child, the eye sign on the forehead and the insignia on the wing to represent him as a Shiva avatar and named him 'shankar'
 inhen shankaracharya ji ko prativarsh baishakh shukla panchami ko shradhanjali arpit karne ke liye shri shankaracharya jayanti manaai jaati he
 At the time when Jagadguru Shankaracharya emerged, at that time Vedic religion was melting in Bharata and humanity was dying, in such a situation, Acharya Shankar appeared as Bhaskar Prakash Pillar of human religion
 maatr 32 varsh ke jivan kaal main unhone sanathan dharm ko aisi ojasvi shakti pradaan kii ki uski samast murchha dur ho gai
 Shankaracharya had attained good knowledge of Malayalam at the age of three years
 inke pita chaahate the ki ye sanskrit kaa purna gyaan praapt karen
 But due to the premature death of the father, in the infancy, Shankar's head's shadow rose from Shankar's head and the entire burden fell on Shankar ji's mother's shoulders
 lekin unki mata ne kartavya paalan main kami nahin rakhi
 paanch varsh kii avasthaa main inkaa yagyopavit sanskaar karwaakar vedon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye gurukul bhej diya gaya
 They were rich in talent from the beginning, so their guru was also very surprised by their talent
 apratim pratibha sampann shrutidhar balak shankar ne maatr 2 varsh ke samay main veda, puraana, upanishad, ramayana, mahabharat aadi granth kanthsth kar liye
 After that, after being honored with the Guru, he returned home and started serving Mother
 unki matra shakti itani vilakshan thi ki unki prarthana par alwai nadi, jo unke gaanv se bahut dur bahati thi, apana rukh badal kar kaladi gram ke nikat bahane lagi, jisase unki mata ko nadi snaan main suvidha ho gai
 After some time, his mother thought of his marriage
 par acharya shankar gruhasthi ke jhanjhat se dur rahanaa chaahate the
 An astrologer had also told by looking at the birth chart that at a young age there is the possibility of his death
 aisa jaanakar acharya shankar ke man main sanyas lekar lok-seva kii bhaavana prabal ho gai thi
 He persevered with his mother for retirement and Bal Shankar took retirement at the age of 7
 phir jivan kaa ucchtam lakshya praapt karne ke liye mata se anumati lekar ghar se nikal pade
 One day in the life of Acharya Shankara - Acharya Shankar is versed to reach him in the last moments of Matashree Aryamba's life
 'kaalah krida gachchhatyaayuʼ siddhantanusaar yah kshan udit hota he
 Acharya Shankar gets a foreshadowing from the power of yoga
 chal dete hai ve kerala ke kaalti sthit apane gram kii ore
 As soon as the village enters the border, the storm of memories completely engulfs them
 'are, yahi to alwai nadi he
 i was caught by a crocodile while bathing in it
 matashri se mere sanyas kii anugna milne par hi usne mujhe mukt kiya tha
 There was so much compulsion in his mind while giving permission
 main unka ekmaatr santan
 He is also sanyasom oriented
 vansh shrinkhalaa ke uchhinn hone kii sthiti
 Service of Ekakini Mata- Problem of Sushruva
 phir bhi unhone mujhe sanyas kii anumati di
 'acharya arrives at the door of his house thinking all these things
 acharya kii aahat paakar grihasevika darwaja kholti he 
 Acharya reaches directly to Mother Mathaiya
 sanyasi rup main putr ko dekhakar mata ke netron se ashruvindu dhalakane lagate hai
 In this sequence, the mother's death is done
 matashri ke praan apne sanyasi putr kii utkar pratiksha main hi atake the
 Here eyes see the son, and the second moment Pran gives his body the body of a body with his extraction
 acharya shankar ne sanyas kii diksha lee he, ve parivrajak ho gayi hai
 According to the scriptures, they cannot touch fire
 unke saamne ek bhayankar dharmsankat surasa kii bhaanti munh baaye khadaa ho jaataa he
 If they offer oblation to the mother goddess, then sannyasa is revered by religion
 yadi mukhaagni nahin dete to putr dharm se vimukh hote he
 For some time Acharya's ascetic mind jumped from his mind and runs away
 uske sthaan par saamaanya chitt kaa pravesh ho jaataa he
 Seeing the maternal body, he deviates like a normal human
 matashri ke haathon ko apane haath main lekar ateet main kho jate hai
 Think 'I did so much service with these hands
 aaj ye haath itane paravash ho gayi hai
 In childhood, she used to rub me in the Poorna River with these hands
 khilaate samay saathi bacchon ke saath main khilne ke liye bhaag jaataa tha
 She used to run and catch me and feed with these hands
 inhen haathon se ve pratidin menre sharir par telumardan karti thim
 When Dadashree died, Mothershree wanted to spend the rest of her life with my mind
 par menre sanyasi hone ke pashchaat ve puri tarah se tut gayin
 In my absence, he had only one task left, waiting for death
 'acharya shankar ateet se vartmaan main utarate hai
 At the same time, the housekeeper whispers in his ear, 'your Namboodri family will not participate in the funeral procession of the mother
 unke asahyog kaa kaaran yah he ki ve aapke is krity ko shaastra viruddh or parampara viruddh maanate hai
 It is said that when a sannyasi gives up his home, it is against the scripture to return to his home principal
 agni sparsh uske liye sarvatha varjit he
 We cannot support Acharya Shankar in working against such scriptures
 sevika kii baat sunakar acharya ek kshan ke liye udign ho jate hai
 They do not understand how they will go to the crematorium with the dead body of mother alone
 kuch samay ke liye ve kinkartavyavimudh ho jate hai
 Suddenly a solution flashes in his mind
 'matashri ke shav ko shmashaan ghat par na le jaakar yadi grih parisar main hi antyeshti kar di jaay to isamen kya aapatti ho sakati he
 ʼ Some such feeling comes in the mind of Acharya
 sagotri log dur se hi acharya kii dwividha kaa anand le rahe hai
 No one supports them in these moments of disaster
 antatah acharya shankar apane ghar ke saamne hi chita sajaate hai
 Somehow the body of the mother is placed on the pyre
 haath main agnishikha lekar chita kii parikrama karte hue shav ko mukhaagni dete hai
 Acharya converts the house premises into a crematorium
 chita se uthi lapaton ko dekhakar acharya ko lagata he jaise agni dev unki mata ke sookshm sharir ko lekar pitralok kii ore prayaag kar rahe hai
 Gradually the flames of the pyre calm down but the mind of the Acharya gets upset for his relatives
 sochate hai, itani baari vipattiyon me hamaare sagotriyo ne sahanubhuti kaa ek shabd bhi muh se nahin nikaala
 This mentality of Acharya Shankar leads to a curse, "now the people of this gotra will not cremate the crematorium like me, but in front of their house
 " 'mrisha na hoi dev rishi vaani' siddhanth ke anusaar kerala ke kaalti gram main namboodri brahmanon me aaj bhi shav-dah ghar ke saamne hi kiya jaataa he
 After a long trek from Kerala, he reached Omkarnath on the banks of river Narmada
 vahaan guru govindpad se yoga shiksha tathaa advait brahm gyaan praapt karne lage
 Acharya Shankar continued to practice the Advaita element for three years
 tatpashchaat guru ajna se ve kaashi vishwanath ji ke darshan ke liye nikal pade
 While he was going to Kashi, a Chandal came in his way
 unhone krodhit ho chandal ko vahaan se hat jane ke liye kaha to chandal bolaa- ‘he muni! aap shariron main rahane vaale ek paramatma kii upeksha kar rahe hai, isliye aap abrahman hai
 Therefore, move away from my path
 ’ chandal kii devvani sun acharya shankar ne ati prabhavit hokar kaha-‘aapane mujhe gyaan diya he, at: aap mere guru hue
 Saying this, when Acharya Shankar bowed down to him, he was seen by Shiva and four deities in place of Chandal
 kaashi main kuch din rahane ke dauraan ve mahishmati nagari main acharya mandan mishra se milane gaye
 The domesticated hyena that was home to Acharya Mishra also chanted Veda mantras
 mishra ji ke ghar jaakar acharya shankar ne unhen shastrarth main haraa diya
 Seeing the defeat of her husband Acharya Mishra, wife Acharya said to Shankar - 'mahatmaan! You have just won half a part
 apni yuktiyon se mujhe parajeet karke hi aap vijayi kahala sakenge
 ' tab mishra ji kii patni bharti ne kaamshaastra par prashn karne prarambh kiye
 But Acharya Shankar was a child-celibate, so where would he answer his questions related to work? On this, he asked for a few days time from Bharti Devi and entered into the body and got all the information about that subject
 iske baad acharya shankar ne bharti ko bhi shastrarth main haraa diya
 During his stay in Kashi, he defeated even more learned Pandits in a debate and became famous on the Guru's post
 anek shishyon ne unase diksha grahan kii
 After this, he started promoting religion
 vedant prachaar main sanlagn rahakar unhone anek granthon kii rachana bhi kii
 The Advaita Brahmist Acharya Shankar believed only the uninterrupted Brahman to be true and was immersed in the Brahmana
 ek baar ve brahm muhoort main apane shishyon ke saath ek ati sankri gali se snaan hetu manikarnika ghat ja rahe the
 On the way, a young woman sat mourning her dead husband's head in his lap
 acharya shankar ke shishyon ne us stri se apane pati ke shav ko hataakar rasta dene kii prarthana kii, lekin vah stri use ansuna kar rudan karti rahi
 Then Acharya himself requested him to remove the body
 unka aagrah sunakar vah stri kehane lagi- ‘he sanyasi! aap mujhase baar-baar yah shav hataane ke liye kah rahe hai
 Why don't you ask this dead body to be removed? ' Hearing this, Acharya said- 'O Goddess! You may have also forgotten in mourning that the body itself does not have the power to move away
 ’ stri ne turant uttar diya- ‘mahatman aapaki drushti main to shakti nirpeksh brahm hi jagat kaa karta he
 Then why can't this dead body be removed without power? ' Acharya sat there after hearing such a serious, knowledgeable, mysterious sentence of that woman
 unhen samadhi lag gai
 In the inner eye, he saw - everywhere Adyashakti Mahamaya Leela is mourning
 unka hriday anivarchaneey anand se bhar gaya or mukh se matra vandana kii shabdamayi dhara stotra banakar foot padi
 Now Acharya Shankar became such an ocean in which streams of monotheism, monotheism, pure virtue, specific dualism, devotion to virtuous realization with Nirguna Brahman wisdom started to shake together
 unhone anubhav kiya ki gyaan kii advait bhoomi par jo paramatma nirgun niraakaar brahm he, vahi dwait kii bhoomi par sagun saakaar he
 He considered the worship of Saguna to be the inevitable ladder to reach Nirguna by supporting both Nirguna and Saguna
