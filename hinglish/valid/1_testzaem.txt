is vajah se jo yah chaahate hai ki bharat do yuddh ke samoohon main badal jaae ve bharat or islam donon ke dushman hai
 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return

 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct

 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge

 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 "on the subject of immigration in 1903, Gandhi commented that" i believe that as much as they believe in the purity of their caste, we also 


 We believe that the white race in South Africa should be the best caste Should
 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time

 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion
 " Gandhi was anti-raj in the form where he had a vision of an India that was not under any government
 unka vichaar tha ki ek desh main sachche swashaasan kaa arth he ki pratyak vyakti khud par shashan karata hai tathaa koi aisa rajya nahin jo logon par kanoon lagu kar sake

 ye saatam varg ke andar aati he
 It has two sub-disciplines: jinom pariyojna vah vaigyanik pariyojna he, jiskaa lakshya kisi praani ke sampurna jinom anukram kaa pataa karnaa he
 Gene is the key to our life
 ham vaise hi dikhte yaa karte hai, jo kaaphi ansh tak hamaare deh main chhipe sookshm jin tay karte hai
 Not only this, genes also point towards human history and future
 jin vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he, ki yadi ek baar maanav jati ke samast jeenon kii sanrachana kaa pataa lag jaaye, to manushya kii jin-kundalee ke aadhaar par, uske jivan kii samast jaivik ghatnaon or daihik lakshanon kii bhavishyavaanee karnaa sambhav ho jaayegaa
 Although this is not an easy task, because there are thousands of millions of living cells in the human body
 jeenon ke is vishaal samooh ko jinom kehete hai
 About 136 years ago, Bohemian monk Gregor John Mendel published his experiments on pea seeds, which marked the beginning of a new era of genetics studies
 inhen lekhon se kalantar main anuvanshiki ke niyam banaae gaye
 He named a new genetic unit in it the gene, and formed the rules for its separation
 thomas hunt morgan ne 1910 main drosophila ke upar shodhakarya karte hue, yah siddh kiya, ki jin gunasutra main, ek sidhi pankti main saje hue rahete hai, tathaa koun sa jin gunasutra main kis jagah par he, iskaa bhi pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 1926, Hermann Müller discovered that X-rays in the gene of Drosophila lead to genetic mutations, also known as mutations
 san 1944 main yah pramanit hua ki protein nahin, varan di en e hi jin hota he
 In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered the structure of DNA and stated that it is a curved staircase made of two fibers, or double kundalini-shaped
 kisi bhi praani ke sampurna jinom padaarth ko jinom kehete hai
 The human body is made up of thousands of millions of living cells, which we know as cells
 prayek koshika itani sookshm hoti he, ki ham use keval ankhon se nahin dekh sakate hai
 One has to use the microscope to see it
 prayek koshika ke andar ek cendrak hota he
 Inside each nucleus are thread-shaped structures, called chromosomes
 prayek kendrak main 46 gunasutra hote hai
 23 virtues come from father and 23 from mother
 ye gunasutra protein tathaa neucleic amla se milakar bane hote hai
 Which is called DNA
 neucleic amla kii sanrachanaatmak ikai he newcliotide
 When a cell divides into two cells, then its genome also doubles
 koshika kaa vibhaajan hote samay di en e ke donon tantu pruthak ho jate hai or prayek tantu kaa ek nayaa sampoorak tantu, newcliotide peyaring yaa base peyaring ke niyam se banataa he
 Therefore, each new cell has a new DNA and an old fiber
 base peyaring ke niyam ke paalan se jo nayaa tantu banataa he, vah puraane tantu kii hoobahoo pratilipi hota he
 The DNA is made up of four basic bases: ek tantu kaa e duusare tantu ke tii ke saath, tathaa ek tantu kaa si duusare tantu ke ji ke saath hi judata he
 The filaments of one DNA complement the other
 atah yadi ek tantu kaa anukram pataa ho, to duusare kaa gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 There are hydrogen bonds between these two fibers, which connect the two bases
 di en e ke vibhinn base yugmon kaa vishisht anukram jin kehalaata he
 In fact, the gene itself is the physical and physiological unit of heredity
 isi ke dwaara vah soochna kutit hoti he, jo protein sanshleshan ko nirdeshit karti he
 It is estimated that approximately one to one-half of the genes are in each cell, which are capable of performing all the functions of our body
 parantu aise jin koshika main lagbhag teen pratishat hi hai
 The remaining 97% of DNA is junk or waste DNA, whose exact function is still not known
 yah ek ati mahatvakankshi vrahat evam sarvaadhik kharchili jaivvaigyanik pariyojna he
 The Human Genome Project started in 1988 with the participation of the US Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health
 iskaa aupchaarik shubharambh 1990 main hua
 Over time, it took on a worldwide form
 aththarah deshon kii lagbhag 250 prayogshaalaayein isamen sammilit hai
 Its main goals are: - ausatan manushyon main, prayek gunasutra main lagbhag teraa karod ksharak yugma hote hai
 And about 300 million base pairs are found in the entire genome
 prayek koshika ke gun sutara main, upasthit di en e ke chaar ksharakon kaa nukram pataa lagaana hi, maanav jinom pariyojna kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 The first DNA was required to sequence the genome, for which the help of human donors was taken

 The vast amount of information or data from this project, in the field of science, is a record
 yadhyapi aaj ham manushya kii sampurna anuvaanshik kuta samhita ko padhane main sakasham ho gayi hai, kintu yah kaary utana saral nahin he
 From the beginning to the end, this code code, composed only of different sequences of ATC and G, if recorded, more than two hundred telephone directories will be filled
 maanav jinom sanrachana kaa upyog tabhi sambhav he, jab hazaron jeenon dwaara nirmit proteinon kii kriya vidhi kii jaankaree sulabh ho paye
 The sequence of DNA bases in the gene determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein
 pariyojna ke tahat yah bhi pataa lagaaya jaayegaa, ki jin apane aap ko kis prakaar vyakt karte hai
 It will also be known that why there are so many differences between the genes of mankind and how they flourished
 maanav jeenon kii sanrachanaon kii tulana, anya jeevon kii sanrachanaon se bhi kii jaayegi
 Dr
 Francis Collance, who is the chairman of this human project, believes that by 2050, genomics or genomics will be established as a useful mode

 proteinon main amino amlon kii lambi shrunkhlaayein hotin hai, tathaa ve 20 vibhinn amino amlon dwaara nirmit hotin hai
 The chemical properties of each amino acid are different, and their sequence in different proteins is also different
 iske kaaran prayek protein ek vishesh rup se sanrachit hota he or yah sanrachana uske dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ke liye har prakaar se upyukt hoti he
 Proteins are directly responsible for an organism's lifespan and cellular function

 pandit lekharam ne apane praanon kii parvaah na karte hue hinduon ko dharm parivartan se roka va shuddhi abhiyaan ke praneta bane
 Lekhram was born on 8 Chaitra, Samvat 1915 in Saidpur village of Tehsil Chakwal in Jhelum district
 unke purvaj maharaja ranjit singh kii fouj main
 His father's name was Tara Singh and mother's name was Bhagi Bhari
 unhone aarambh main urdu-farsi padhi
 From childhood, he was self-respecting and strong-minded

 Where did the maulvi drink water from the tied pot
 usne na dobaaraa maulavee se ghar jane kii ijaajat maangi or na hi jutha pani piya
 Spent the whole day thirsty
 padhne kaa unako bahut shok tha
 He came to know Swami Dayanand Saraswati from the books of Munshi Kanhyalal Alakhdhari
 lekharam ji ne rishi dayanand ke sabhi grantho kaa swadhyay aarambh kar diya
 At the age of seventeen, he joined the Peshawar Police in 1875 and became a sergeant

 As a result of Shankasamadhan, he became his exclusive devotee

 Now all his time was spent in Vedic propaganda

 Lekharam ji strongly denied him
 swami dayanand kaa jeevancharit likhane ke uddeshy se unke jivan sambandhi ghatnaayen ikatthi karne ke silsile main unhen bharat ke bahusankhyak sthanon kaa daura karnaa padaa
 Due to this, he got the name 'arya Musafir'
 pan lekharam hinduon ko musalmaan hone se bachaate the
 a staunch Muslim killed him in Lahore on the eid day of March 3, 1897, on the pretext of doing 'purification'
 lekharam ji ne sanwat 1937 vikrami main peshawar main aryasamaj kii sthapana kii
 After leaving from Peshawar, on 17 October 1980, Ajmer reached Panditji to see Swami Dayanand
 shankaasmadhaan ke parinamswaroop ve swami ji ke anany bhakt ban gaye
 In order to collect Swami Dayanand's biography, he had to visit the majority of places in India to collect his life related events
 is kaaran unka naam "arya musafir" pad gaya
 At the age of seventeen, he joined the Peshawar Police in 1875 and became a sergeant
 pandit lekharam ne san 1884 main police kii naukari se apni spashtvaadita evam apane muslim adhikariyon ke asahyog ke kaaran chhod di

 After hearing the lectures of Pandit ji, such a color became the Arya of Chadra and gave Islam to Tilanjali
 His names were Mahashiya Chokhanand, Shri Chhabildas and Mahashiya Khubchand ji, when all three became Aryas, Hindus boycotted them socially
 Afterwards, the mother of Monsieur Chabildas died
 unki arthi ko uthaane vaale keval ye teen hi the
 Monsieur Khandchand's mother took him back
 aap kamare kaa taala tod kar vaapis sanskaar main aa mili
 tino yuvako ne vaidic sanskaar se dah karm kiya

 yah tino yuvak musalmaan ban jaye to hinduon ko koi farak nahin padataa tha parantu pandit lekharam kii krupa se vaidic dharmi ban gaye to dushman ban gaye
 Hindus are still living in slavery mentality because of this kind of mentality

 unke pita ne unke shuddhi main shaamil hone se man kiya par ve nahin maane
 pita ne birdari kaa saath diya
 unki putr se baatcheet band ho gayi
 But where were Rehtulal ji supposed to believe, he said that i can give up my house but i cannot leave the Arya Samaj
 Thus the influence of the tenacity of Pandit Lekhram was that even among his disciples, the spirit was filled with cries to protect the Vedic doctrine

 Pandit ji he reached on a fixed date

 An incident of 1896 will always inspire us with the life of Pandit Lekhram
 When Panditji returned from the campaign, he came to know that his son was ill

 You returned home in two hours and left for Mustafabad

 Your one and a quarter year old son died from behind
 Where did Panditji have time to grieve
 aap vaapis aakaar veda prachaar ke liye wazirabad chale gaye
 Panditji's reasoning power was amazing
 aapse ek baar kisi ne prashn kiya kii hindu itani badi sankhya main muslmaan kaise ho gaye
 Give your seven reasons
 1
 muslmaan akraman main balatpurvak musalmaan banaaya gaya 2
 During the Muslim rule, many reputed Hindus were converted into Muslims by giving them land, land and land
 3
 islamic kaal main urdu, farsi kii shiksha evam sanskrit kii durgati ke kaaran bane 4
 Due to non-remarriage among Hindus and the prohibition of the practice of Sati, Hindu women graced the house of a Muslim and if a Hindu youth had a relationship with a Muslim woman, he was cast out of caste and converted to Muslim
 5
 murtipuja kii kuriti ke kaaran kai hindu vidharmee bane 6
 Muslim prostitutes implicated many Hindus to become Muslims 7
 vaidic dharm kaa prachaar na hone ke kaaran muslmaan bane
 If thought deeply, Panditji has told the Hindus the measures to protect the caste, if the Hindus will improve even if they do not improve now

 Panditji remained in Qadian for two months but Mirza Ghulam Ahmad could not show any miracle
 is khij se aryasamaj or pandit lekharam ko apana kattar dushman maanakar mirza ne aryasamaj ke viruddh dushprachaar aarambh kar diya
 Mirza printed a book called Brahin Ahmedia by asking for donations
 Pandit ji gave his answer in writing to Takzib Brahin Ahmedia

 According to the Nanaghat inscription, Shatkarni expanded his empire and performed two Ashwamedha Yajna and one Rajasuya Yajna during his work

 It is suggested on the basis of the similarity of the script used in the Nanaghat article and the Elephant Gumpha writings, that perhaps in the second year of the reign of this Shatkarni rulers, the great ruler of Kalinga, Kharkhel was defeated in the battle field

 Duryodhana was a man of great intelligence
 usne shakuni ke kehane par pando ko bachapan main kai baar maarane kaa praytn kiya
 When he was a youth, when more superior Yudhishthir was made as the crown prince, Shakuni tried to burn the Pandavas by putting them in a fire made of laksha and set them ablaze, but with the help of Vidur, the five Pandavas along with their mother from that burning house Walked out apane uttam gunon ke kaaran yudhisthir hastinapur ke prajajanon main atyant lokapriy ho gayi
 Seeing his qualities and popularity, Bhishma Pitamah asked Dhritarashtra to crown Yudhishthira
 duryodhana nahin chahta tha ki yudhisthir raja bane atah usne apane pita dhritarashtra se kaha, “pitaaji! yadi ek baar yudhisthir ko rajsinghaasana praapt ho gaya to yah rajya sadaa ke liye pandavon ke vansh kaa ho jaayegaa or ham kauravon ko unka sevak ban kar rahanaa padegaa
 On this Dhritarashtra said, "vats Duryodhana! Yudhishthira is the eldest of the children of our family, so he has the right over this state
 phir bhishma tathaa prajajan bhi usee ko raja bananaa chaahate hai
 We cannot do anything about it
 ” dhritarashtra ke vachanon ko sun kar duryodhana ne kaha, “pitaaji! maine iskaa prabandh kar liya he
 Just send the Pandavas to Varanavat in some way
 ” Duryodhana had built a building called Purochan for the residence of the Pandavas in Varanavat, which was made of extremely flammable materials like lac, fat, hay, moong
 duryodhana ne pandavon ko us bhawan main jala daalane kaa shadyantra rachaa tha
 On Dhritarashtra's direction, Yudhishthira left with his mother and brothers to go to Varanavat
 duryodhana ke shadyantra ke vishay main vidura ko pataa chal gaya
 So, while going to Varanavat, they met the Pandavas on the way and said to them, “look, Duryodhana has built a flammable substance building in Varanavat Nagar for you guys to live in, which will ignite as soon as the fire starts
 isaliye tum log bhawan ke andar se van tak pahunchne ke liye ek surang avashya banavaa lenaa jisase ki aag lagane par tum log apni raksha kar sako
 i will send the tunnel builder to you secretly
 tum log us laakshagrih main atyant saavdhaanee ke saath rahanaa
 " varanavat main yudhisthir ne apane chachaa vidura ke bheje gayi karigar kii sahaayta se gupt surang banavaa liya
 The Pandavas started searching for a place to hide themselves on the pretext of going to the forest for constant hunting
 kuch din isi tarah bitaane ke baad ek din yadhishthir ne bhimsen se kaha, “bhim! ab dusht purochan ko isi laakshagrih main jala kar hamen bhaag nikalnaa chaiye
 "bhima summoned Purochan on the same night under some pretext and imprisoned him in a room in that building
 uske pashchaat bhawan main aag laga diya or apni mata kunti evam bhaaiyon ke saath surang ke raste van main bhaag nikle
 When the news of the Laksha Griha being consumed reached Hastinapur, the people there were extremely sad considering the Pandavas dead

 is tarah se jantuon evam padpon ke vargeekaran ko vargiki yaa vargeekaran vigyaan angreji main vargiki ke liye do shabd prayog main laaye jate hai - texonomi tathaa systematics 
 Karl Linnaeus wrote the book Sistema Naturai based on the word Systematics in 1735 AD

 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description
 vargiki kaa mul nirmaan aakaaraki yaa akritivigyaan, kriyavigyaan, paristhitiki or anuvanshiki par aadhaarit he
 Like other scientific disciplines, it is also a synthesis of many types of knowledge, opinions and systems, which are used in the field of classification

 Nowadays more than four lakh species of plants are known
 ye linius ke samay se sathguni adhik hai
 About 4,750 new castes are described every year
 samanarthak or upjatiyon ko milakar keval fenrogams or kriptogams naamak padap samoohon main 1763 se 1942 i
 tak das lakh se bhi adhik naam die ja chuke hai
 The species of animals described are more than the plant species in the count
 upjatiyon ko milakar 20 lakh se adhik jantujatiyon ke naam gyaat hai or prati varsh lagbhag 10,000 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 The history of taxonomy is as old as human history
 samaj boojh hote hi manushya ne aas paas ke jantuon or paudhon ko pahchaanana tathaa unako naam dena prarambh kiya
 Many ancient scholars of Greece, notably Hippocrates and Democritus, have ranked animals in their studies
 spasht rup se arestu ne apane samay ke gyaan kaa upyukt sankalan kiya he
 The beginning of classification appears in the mention of Aristotle
 inkaa mat he ki jantu apane rahan sahan ke dhang, swabhaav or shaareerik aakaar ke aadhaar par pruthak kiye ja sakate hai
 He mentions animal groups such as birds, fish, whale, insects, and has also used the words Coleoptera and Diptera for small groups

 John Ray was the first person in the field of genealogical experts to distinguish between caste and lineage, and was the first among ancient scientists to have a higher natural classification
 inkaa prabhaav sweden ke rahanevaale mahaan prakrutivaadee karl liniyas par padaa
 Linnaeus did unique work in this direction
 isliye inhen vargeekaran vigyaan kaa janmdata mana jaataa he
 In the eighteenth century, the ideas of evolutionism had an impact on taxonomy
 unnisvin shatabdi ke madhya main yah prabhaav apane shikhar par pahunch gaya
 At the same time, classification experts became very interested in animals from distant places
 ve dur deshon ke jaanwaron ke vishay main jaankaree karnaa chaahate the or parichit jaanwaron se unka sambandh karnaa chaahate the
 Hence, there were long voyages at this time
 dur dur ke jaanwaron kaa adhyayan kiya gaya or unke vansh tathaa kutumb aadi kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 One such voyage took place on a ship called Bigley which also included a naturalist named Charles Darwin
 is kaal main vargeekaran vigyaan main badi pragati kii gai or vargeekaran main anek nai jatiyaan, vansh or kutumb jode gaye
 Classification made in the twentieth century is characteristic of science

 In earlier times, the basis of classification science was "types", which were presented with the help of natural traits

 Formal concept broadens the stability of ranges, increases the differences between each other and reduces variability
 iske vipareet he jansankhya sankalpana, jiske anusaar spishiz parivartansheel jansankhya se bani he or sthir nahin he
 Defining specific groups or categories by reverse means a definite method of classification
 linius ne aisi paanch shreniyan banaai thim : Each category consists of one or more lower level groups and they form the lower category
 isi tarah prayek kramik shrenee ek athwa ek se adhik unchi shrenee se sambandhit hoti he
 These ranges form a comprehensive system by decreasing natural discernment
 gyaan ke vikaas ke saath saath in shreniyon kii sankhya badhati gai
 Between the world and the class, between the union and the gana and the dynasty, categories called kutumb were added
 linius ke vicharanusaar prajati ek vaikalpik shrenee he, jiske antargat bhugolic athwa vyaktigat vibhinnata aati he
 In this way, the following seven categories are now: vargeekaran kii or adhik parishuddh vyakhya ke liye in shreniyon ko bhi vibhajit kar anya shreniyan banaai gai hai
 Mostly these categories are named by adding prefixes or sub prefixes before the original name
 udaahranarth, adhigan or upagan aadi
 Many names were proposed for higher categories, but they are not in common use
 keval aadim jati kaa kutumb or vansh ke bich prayog kiya jaataa he
 Some authors, such as Simpson, have used the name cohort between gana and class

 unka pehla prakashit upanyaas 'suuni ghati kaa suraj' tathaa pehla prakashit vyang 'angad kaa paanv' he
 He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for the novel 'raag Darbari', which exposed the valuelessness of rural life in post-independence India
 unke is upanyaas par ek doordarshan-dharawahik kaa nirmaan bhi hua
 Shri Shukla has been honored with the Padma Bhushan Award in 2008 by the Government of India
 shrilaal shukla kaa vyaktitv apni misaal aap tha
 Spontaneous but cautious, humorous but scholarly, undisciplined but chaotic
 shrilaal shukla angrezi, urdu, sanskrit or hindi bhashaa ke vidwaan the
 Srilal Shukla was a rash-penetrator of both classical and facile aspects of music
 'kathakram' samaaroh samiti ke vah adhyaksh rahe
 Shrilal Shukla ji struggled poverty, but his lament did not fill the writing
 unhen nai peedi bhi sabase zyaada padhati he
 He was one of the senior creators who understood and read the new generation the most
 na padhane or likhane ke liye log saidhaantiki banaate hai
 Shrilalji stopped writing and reading due to serious health reasons
 shrilaal shukla kaa vyaktitv bada sahaj tha
 He always smiled and welcomed everyone
 lekin apni baat bina laag-lapet kehete the
 Due to this quality of personality, he gave a composition like Raga Darbari which hurt the system even though he was in government service to Hindi literature
 suuni ghati kaa suraj · agyatavaas · ragadrabari · aadmi kaa zehar · seemayen tuutati hanmakaan · pehla padaav · vishrampur kaa sant · angad kaa paanv · yahan se vahaan · umravnagar main kuch din He was coined as Shivpalganj with his amazing language style, mythical craft and indigenous idioms
 traasadiyon or vidambnaaon ke isi samya ne ‘raag darbari’ ko mahaan kriti banaaya, to is kriti ne shrilaal shukla ko mahaan lekhak
 Raag Darbari is a satire or novel, it is an excellent work, which has been done and done by crores of readers
 ‘vishrampur kaa sant’, ‘suuni ghati kaa suraj’ or ‘yah meraa ghar nahin’ jaisi kritiyaan saahitiyik kasautiyon main khari sabit hui hai
 Rather, the 'saint of Vishrampur' was said to be a strong expression of the game of power in independent India
 raag darbari ko itane varshon baad bhi padhate hue uske paatr hamaare aasapaas najar aate hai
 When Shuklji wrote it, a kind of frustration was seen all around
 yah mohabhang kaa daur tha
 In such a despotic atmosphere, he had brought out the discrepancies of the society in a crude style
 vah shreshth rachanaakaar ke saath hi ek samvedansheel or vinamr insaan bhi the
 a large part of Srilal Shukla's compositions is related to village life
 gramin jivan ke vyapak anubhav or nirantar parivartit hote paridrishy ko unhone bahut gaharaai se vishleshit kiya he
 It can also be said that by going to the roots, Srilal Shukla has extensively searched the society and caught its pulse
 isiilie yah gramin sansar unke sahitya main dekhne ko mila he
 The basic background of his literature is village society, but all the images of urban life are also seen in it
 shrilaal shukla ne sahitya or jivan ke prati apni ek sahaj dharna kaa ullekh karte hue kaha he ki - In fiction, i am very fond of reality despite being committed to some fundamental moral values of life
 par yatharth kii yah dharna ikhari nahin he, vah bahustareey he or uske sabhi str - aadhyatmik, abhyantarik, bhautik aadi jatil rup se antargumphit hai
 Their identity and feeling in the overall form may make the composition complex at some places, but the grip of that wholeness makes the composition superior
 jaise manushya ek saath kai staron par jeeta he, vainse hi is samagrata kii pahchaan rachana ko bhi bahustareeyata detii he
 One can easily see even the smallest distortion of Shree Lal Shukla's subtle and sharp vision system, examines it
 unhone apane lekhan ko sirf raajnneeti par hi kendrit nahin hone diya
 He also satirized the plight of the education sector
 1963 main prakashit unki pehali rachana ‘dharmayug’ shiksha ke kshetra main vyaapt visangatiyon par aadhaarit he
 In the satirical collection 'angad Ka Paaw' and the novel 'raag Darbari', Shrilal Shukla has extended it
 desh ke anek sakaari skulon kii sthiti dayaneey he
 They do not even have a good building
 kahin kahin to tambuon main kakshaayen chalaati hai, arthath newtam suvidhaon kaa bhi abhaav he
 Shrilal Shukla commenting on this says that - "yahi haal ‘raag darbari’ ke chhangamal vidhyalay intermediat college kaa bhi he, jahaan se intermediat paas karne vaale ladke sirf imaarat ke aadhaar par kah sakate hai, sainitory fitting kis chidiya kaa naam he
 We have found in the native tradition till the vilayati talim and that is why we see, we are as much natural even today, even after reading this, our urine comes down on the trunk of the tree
 " Ironically, nowadays teachers also do everything except teaching
 ‘raag darbari’ ke master mothiram kii tarah ve kaksha main padhaate kam hai or zyaada samay apni aate kii chakki ko samarpit karte hai
 Most teachers are Motiram, whatever the name may be
 tution lete hai, dukaan chalaate hai or tarah tarah ke nijee dhandhe karte hai
 Where do they have time left to deliver to students? shrilaal shukla ne apane sahitya ke madhyam se samasamyik sthitiyon par karaari chot kii he
 they say that - ‘aaj maanav samaaj apane patan ke liye khud jimmedaar he
 Today he cannot laugh openly
 hansane ke liye bhi ‘laffing club’ kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 One has to go to the oxygen parlor for pure air
 band bottle kaa pani pinaa padataa he
 Have to eat instant bursts
 khilne ke liye, ek-duusare se baat karne ke liye bhi vakt kii kami he
 ' kul milakar yah kah sakate hai ki shrilaal shukla ke sahitya main jivan kaa sangharsh he or unka sahitya saamaajik sarokaaron se judaa he
 In 1969, Shrilal Shukla received the Sahitya Akademi Award
 lekin iske baad gyanpith ke liye 42 saal tak intazaar karnaa padaa
 Meanwhile, he also received the Vyas Samman, Yash Bharti and Padma Bhushan awards of the Birla Foundation
