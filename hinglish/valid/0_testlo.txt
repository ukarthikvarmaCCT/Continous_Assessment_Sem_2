 Kumar Chokshananda Sangakkara is a Sri Lankan cricketer and captain of the Sri Lankan national cricket team
 ve baayen haath ke sheersh kram ke ballebaaj hai
 He used to play as a wicket-keeper and top-order batsman in all forms of the game, but in Test matches he dropped that order, as his batting average in Tests when he plays as a pure batsman
 Is quite high
 sangakara kaa janm 1977 main metale main kumari or chokshanada sangakara ke ghar main hua
 Sangakkara studied at Kandi College, Trinity and became the winner of that year's Ride Medal
 He showed both his cricket and tennis talents at school and it was his principal, Mr
 Leonard d'alvis, who advised his mother to encourage Sangakkara to play cricket
 sangakara ne ek ballebaaj ke rup main apane carrier kii shuruuaat kii lekin baad main ve ek wicket-keeper bhi bane
 unki ballebaaji kaa vikaas kuch is tarah hua ki ve ek baar ke liye alji isisi test ballebaaji ranking main sheersh par kaabiz ho gaye
 However, in 2006 he gave the responsibility of captaining the Test matches to Prasanna Jayawardene and since then he has been performing his game as an expert batsman
 ek divasiy antarrashtriya or twanti -20 cricket main srilanka ke wicket-keeper ke rup main ve bane hue hai
 As of September 2009, he was ranked number one in the Test batting rankings
 sangakara ko isisi ol-time test ballebaaji ranking main chhathen sthaan par rakhaa gaya he
 Sangakkara prefers to play the ball in the off-side in the direction of a wicket scar and, after scoring a century, crosses 150 each time

 His skills were recognized worldwide when he was selected for the ICC World XI One International Day Team in October 2005 in the Johnny Walker series against Australia
 test cricket main teji se 8000 ran banane kaa bhi unka record kaayam he
 He broke the record set by Sachin Tendulkar during the third Test match against India on 6 August 2010
 Despite losing all odis by a considerable margin to the World XI, Sangakkara's series finale was respectable as he scored an average of 46 in the series

 It has two main languages: Kaman and Zekhring
 sambhav he ki zekhring ek tibeti-burmi bhashaa ho jabaki kaman ek bhashaa viyojak ho
 Blench also revealed in 2015 that both Command and Zekhring are likely language breakers in which words are equated with interchange
 unke anusaar sambhav he ki zekhring ne pehle kaman or tibetai bhashaaon se or phir naga bhashaaon or jingpo se shabd liye hai
 It has been established that the two languages do not have a corresponding relationship with the northern Mishmi languages

 We find the oldest oral literature in the world in tribal languages
 is drushti se adivasee sahitya sabhi sahitya kaa mul strot he
 The Republic of India has 22 officially recognized languages
 jinamein maatr 2 adivasee bhashaaon - santhali or bodo - ko hi shaamil kiya gaya he
 India is a vast country of many languages - Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu in the northwest; Oriya in the east, Assamese in Bengal; Marathi and Gujarati in the mid-west and Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam in the south
 inke atirikt katipay or bhi bhashaaen hai jinka saahitiyik evam bhashavaigyanik mahatva kam nahin he- jaise kashmiri, dogri, sindhi, konkani, turu aadi
 Each of these, especially each of the first twelve languages, has its own literature which is extremely rich in terms of antiquity, diversity, quality and magnitude
 yadi aadhunik bhartiya bhashaaon ke hi sampurna vaanmay kaa sanchayan kiya jaye to vah europe ke sankalit vaanmay se kisi bhi drushti se kam nahin hoga
 By incorporating Vedic Sanskrit, Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit and Apabhramanas, its infinite expansion crosses the limits of imagination - a vast storehouse of knowledge, deeper than the Indian Ocean, wider than the geographical spread of India, the Himalayan peaks
 Higher than and even more subtle than the imagination of Brahman
 bharat kii prayek bhashaa ke sahitya kaa apana swatantra or prakhar vaishishty he jo apane pradesh ke vyaktitv se mudrankit he
 How much the state borders of Punjabi and Sindhi, Hindi and Urdu are found here! But what makes the specialty of their literature so special! Similarly, the life of Gujarati and Marathi is intertwined, but is there any possible confusion between them! The origins of the languages of the South are one: all are variations of the Dravidian family, but can there be doubt as to the formulation of Kannada and Malayalam or Tamil and Telugu formations! The same is true of Bengali, Assamese and Oriya
 bengaal ke gahare prabhaav ko pachaakar asamiya or oriya apane swatantra astitv ko banaaye hue hai
 All these literatures have their own distinct personalities
 tamil kaa sangam-sahitya, telugu ke dwi-arthi kavy or udhaaharan tathaa avdhaan-sahitya, malayalam ke sandesh-kavy evam kir-geet tathaa manipravalam style, marathi ke pavaade, gujarati ke akhyan or phagu, banglaa kaa mangal kavy, asamiya ke badgit or buranji sahitya, punjabi ke ramyaakhyaan tathaa veergati, urdu kii ghazal or hindi kaa reetikavy tathaa chhayavaad aadi apane-apane bhashaa–sahitya ke vaishishty ke ujjwal pramaan hai
 Yet perhaps it is not of the separable soul
 jis prakaar anek dharmon, vichaar-dhaaraon or jivan pranaaliyon ke rahete hue bhi bhartiya samskruti kii ekta asandigdh he, isi prakaar isi kaaran se anek bhashaaon or abhivyanjana-paddatiyon ke rahete hue bhi bhartiya sahitya kii moolbhoot ekta kaa anusandhan bhi sahaj-sambhav he
 The essence and diversity of Indian literature is unique, its originality is even more delightful
 dakshin main tamil or udhar urdu ko chhodkar bharat kii lagbhag sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon kaa janm-kaal praayah samaan hi he
 The oldest known poet of Telugu literature is Nannay, whose time is the eleventh Sati of Christ
 kannada kaa pratham uplabdh granth he ‘kavirajmarg’, jiske lekhak hai rashkrut-vansh ke naresh nripatung ; or malayalam kii sarvapratham kriti hai ‘ramcharitam’ jiske vishay main rachanakaal or bhashaa-swaroop aadi kii anek samasyaayen or jo anumaanatah terahavin shatee kii rachana he
 The appearance of Gujarati and Marathi is almost the same
 gujarati kaa aadi-granth san 1185 i
 main rachit shalibhadra bharateshwar kaa ‘bahu-baliraas’ he or marathi ke aadim sahitya kaa aavirbhaav barahavin shatee main hua tha
 The same matter is true in eastern languages
 banglaa kii charya-geeton kii rachana shaayad dasvin or barahavin shatabdi ke bich kisi samay hui hogi; asamiya-sahitya ke sabase pracheen udhaaharan praayah terahavin shatabdi ke ant ke hai jinamein sarvshereshth hai hem saraswati kii rachanaayen ‘prahlaadacharitra’ tathaa ‘harigaurisamvaad’
 In the Oriya language, the thirteenth century certainly begins to have satirical poetry and folklore
 udhar chaudaavin shatee main to oriya ke vyas sarladaas kaa aavirbhaav ho hi jaataa he
 Similarly, systematic literature starts to be available in Punjabi and Hindi from the eleventh century
 keval do bhashaayen aisi hai jinka janmkaal bhinn he—tamil, jo sanskrit ke samaan pracheen he or urdu, jiskaa vaastavik aarambh pandrahavin shatee se purv nahin mana ja saktaa
 However, some scholars have begun to believe that Urdu originated from the compositions of Baba Farid, Abdullah Hameed Nagori and Amir Khusro of the 13-14th century
 janmkaal ke atirikt aadhunik bhartiya saahitiyon ke vikaas ke charan bhi praayah samaan hi hai
 Almost everyone runs until the fifteenth century
 purvamadhyakaal kii samaapti mughal-vaibhav ke ant arthath shatee ke madhya main tathaa satrahavin shatee ke madhya main tathaa uttar madhyakaal kii angreji satta kii sthapana ke saath hoti he or tabhi se aadhunik yug kaa aarambh ho jaataa he
 Thus, the developmental order of most literature in Indian languages is almost the same; All are divided into four levels of same era
 is samanaantar vikaas-kram kaa aadhaar atyant spasht he or vah he bharat ke raajnneetik evam saanskrithik jivan kaa vikaas-kram
 India has been in the same political system for centuries despite the interruption
 mughal-shashan main to lagbhag dedh sau varshon tak uttar-dakshin or purv-pashchim main ghanishtha sampark bana rahaa
 This contact did not break even after the Mughal power was fragmented
 mughal-shashan ke pehle bhi rajya-vistaar ke praytn hote rahe the
 Among the Rajputs, not a single umbrella was an indo-emperor, but their dynasty was ruling in many parts of India
 shashan bhinn-bhinn hone par bhi unki saamantiya shashan-pranali praayah ek-si thi
 Similarly, there was a clear fundamental similarity in the system of governance of the Muslims
 baad main angrejon ne to kendriya shashan-vyavastha kaayam kar is ekta ko or bhi drudh kar diya
 Due to all these reasons, there has been enough equanimity in the political conditions of different linguistic regions of India
 raajnneetik paristhitiyon kii apeksha saanskrithik paristhitiyon kaa samya or bhi adhik rahaa he
 In the last millennium, there were many religious and cultural movements that had a pan-india influence
 buddha-dharm ke hraas ke yug main uski kai shakhaon or shaiva-shakt dharmon ke sanyog se nath-sampradaay uth khadaa hua jo isa ke dwitiya sahatrabd ke aarambh main uttar main tibet aadi tak, dakshin main purvi ghat ke pradeshon main, pashchim main maharashtra aadi main or purv main priahsarvatra failaa hua tha
 The practice of these sadhus, including Nath, Siddha, and Shaiva, despite the primacy of yoga, did not neglect the thoughts and sentiments of life, and many of these sadhus have tended to be poetic for both self-expression and theory-rendering
 Used to be bhartiya bhashaaon ke vikaas ke pratham charan main in sampradaayon kaa prabhaav praayah vidyaman tha
 After these, Sufi-saints of his successor saints and newcomers started spreading to different parts of the country
 sant-sampradaay vedant darshan se prabhavit the or nirgun bhakthi kii sadhana tathaa prachaar karte the
 In Sufi religion too, the formless Brahm was worshiped, but his medium was ardent love
 sufi-santo kaa yadhyapi uttar-pashchim main adhik prabhutv tha, phir bhi dakshin ke bijapur or golkunda rajyon main bhi inke anek centre the or vahaan bhi anek prasiddh sufi sant hue
 After this, the Vaishnava movement started which spread throughout the country with great speed
 ram or krishna kii bhakthi kii anek madhur paddatiyon kii desh-bhar main prasar huai or samast bharatvarsh sagun ishwar ke lila-gaan se gunjaarit ho uthaa
 On the other hand, the influence of Muslim culture and civilization was also increasing continuously
 irani samskruti ke anek aakarshak tatva-jaise vaibhav-vilaas, alankaran sajja aadi bhartiya jivan main bade veg se ghul-mil rahe the or ek nayi darbari yaa nagar samskruti kaa aavirbhav ho rahaa tha
 Due to political and economic influence, this culture soon lost its prasadamya influence and has morbid luxury in place of the flourishing and joyous side of life
 tabhi pashchim ke vyapaariyon kaa aagaman hua jo apane saath paashchaatya-shiksha kaa sanskaar laaye or jinke peeche-peeche masihi prachaarkon ke dal bharat main pravesh karne lage
 In the nineteenth century, English dominated the whole country and the ruling class actively planned and spread their education, culture and through them directly or indirectly
 praachya or paashchaatya ke is sampark or sangharsh se aadhunik bharat kaa janm hua
 Although the family of languages of India is not one, their literary base is the same
 ramayana, mahabharat, puraana, bhagwat, sanskrit kaa abhijatya sahitya - arthath kalidas, bhawabhooti, baan, sriharsh, amruk or jayadev aadi kii amar kritiyaan, pali, praakrit tathaa apbhransh main likhit buddha, jain tathaa anya dharmon kaa sahitya bharat kii samast bhashaaon ko uttaradhikaar main mila
 Under the Shastra, the Upanishads, the conspiracy, the memories etc
 and there are many immortal texts of poetry - Natyashastra, Soundanyalak, Kaviprakash, Sahityadarpan Rasagandhar etc
 have also used the concept of philosophy continuously
 vastav main aadhunik bhartiya bhashaaon ke ye akshay prerana-strot hai jo praayah sabhi ko samaan rup se prabhavit karte rahe hai
 Their influence has certainly been very coordinating and a kind of fundamental similarity has automatically come into the literature inspired by them
 —is prakaar samaan raajnneetik, saanskrithik or sahityaki aadharbhumi par pallavit-pushpit bhartiya sahitya main janmajaat samanta ek sahaj ghatana he
 The oldest surviving literature is the Rigveda, written in Sanskrit language
 sanskrit, pali, praakrit or apbhransh aadi anek bhashaaon se guzarate hue aaj ham bhartiya sahitya ke aadhunik yug tak pahunche hai
 India has more than 30 major languages and more than 100 regional languages
 lagbhag har bhashaa main sahitya kaa prachur vikaas hua he
 Both written and oral are important in the literature of Indian languages
 pracheen bhartiya sahitya main hindu dharmik grantho kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Along with the Vedas, epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata were composed in ancient India
 anya pracheen grantho main vaastu shaastra, kautilya arth-shaastra, panchatantr, hitopadesh aadi pramukh he
 Military engineering is the design, construction and maintenance of military operations under military science
 isamen anya kaaryon ke atirikt aakraamak, surakshatmak or logistic sanrachanaayen - sabhi aa jaati hai
 But mostly it involves fortifications and landmines, construction and demolition of bridges, laying of landmines and destroying them
 apbhransh, aadhunik bhashaaon ke udai se pehle uttar bharat main bolchaal or sahitya rachana kii sabase jeevant or pramukh bhashaa 
 Linguistically, apostrophe is the last stage of the medieval period of the Indian Aryan language, which is the position between Prakrit and modern languages
 apbhransh ke kaviyon ne apni bhashaa ko keval 'bhaasa', 'desi bhaasa' athwa 'gamell bhaasa' kaha he, parantu sanskrit ke vyakaranon or alankargranthon main us bhashaa ke liye praayah 'apbhransh' tathaa kahin-kahin 'apbhrasht' sangya kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 In this way, the name Apabhransh is given by Sanskrit masters, which appears to be contemptuous of emergency
 mahabhashyakaar patanjali ne jis prakaar 'apbhransh' shabd kaa prayog kiya he usase pataa chalata he ki sanskrit yaa sadhu shabd ke lokprachlit vividh rup apbhransh yaa apshabd kehalaate the
 In this way, the words deceived, ejaculated, corrupted or mutilated by the paradigm were labeled as abusive and later on the language was accepted for the whole language
 dandi ke kathan se is tathy kii pushti hoti he
 He has clearly written that in Shastra i
e
 grammar scripture, words other than Sanskrit are called apabhransh; Thus, pali-prakrit-apabhramsa all come under the word 'apabhramsa', yet Pali Prakrit was not named 'apabhramsa'
 patanjali aadi vidwaanon ne praakrit or apbhransh naamon kaa prayog samaan arth main kiya he
 But Bharatamuni's Natyashastra is the first such work in which actual reference to apabhramsa is found
 vahaan aabhiron kii boli ko, jisamen -u kaa prayog bahutayat main miltaa he, apbhransh kaha gaya he 
 Dandi has further clarified this by saying that in poetry, serious dialects are remembered with the name Apabhramsa; From this it can be concluded that the name Apabhransh was stereotyped for the language whose words were non-sanskrit as well as whose grammar was also mainly based on Abhiradi folk dialects
 isi arth main apbhransh pali-praakrit aadi se vishesh bhinn thi
 In relation to apabhramsa, two types of conflicting opinions are found in ancient ornamental texts
 ek orakavyalankar ke tikaakar namisadhu apbhransh ko praakrit kehete hai to duusari ore bhamah, dandi aadi acharya apbhransh kaa ullekh praakrit se bhinn swatantra kavyabhasha ke rup main karte hai
 While resolving these opposing views, Yakogi has stated that apabhramsa is close to Prakrit in terms of vocabulary and is grammatically different from Prakrit
 is prakaar apbhransh ke shabdkosh kaa adhikansh, yahan tak ki nabbe pratishat, praakrit se grihith he or vyakaranik gathan prakritik roopon se adhik viksit tathaa aadhunik bhashaaon ke nikat he
 a systematic study of the ideas of apostrophes of ancient grammar shows that in six hundred years, apabhramsa developed gradually
 bharat ne ise shabar, aabhir, gurjar aadi kii bhashaa bataaya he
 Chand has called it Vibhasha in 'prakritalakshanam' and around that, Raj Dhruvsen II of Balabhi praised his father in a copperplate, proficient in Sanskrit and Prakrit as well as apabhramsa management
 apbhransh ke kavyasamarth bhashaa hone kii pushti bhamah or dandi jaise aacharyon dwaara aage chalakar saatvin shatee main ho gai
 Poetical narrator Rajasekhar indicated the honor of Apabhransh by giving a respectable place in the Rajya Sabha to the apabhramsa poets, while the commentator Purushottam gave it the language of the courtesan
 isi samay acharya hemchandra ne apbhransh kaa vistrut or sodaaharan vyakaran likhakar apbhransh bhashaa ke gauravpurn pad kii pratishtha kar di
 In this way, the language which was the folk language of the severe tribes in the third century, became a literary language from the sixth century and by the 11th century, it became the language and official language of the best class
 apbhransh ke kramshah bhugolic vistarsuchak ullekh bhi pracheen granthon main milte hai
 Till the time of Bharat, it was the dialect of northwestern India, but by the time of Rajasekhar, it became the language of the whole of western India i
e
 Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat
 saath hi swayambhu, pushpadanth, dhanpal, kankaamar, sarahapa, kanhpa aadi kii apbhransh rachanaaon se pramanit hota he ki us samay yah samooche uttar bharat kii saahitiyik bhashaa ho gai thi
 Vyakaranas have also discussed the differences of apabhramsa
 markandeya ke anusaar iske nagar, upanaagar or brachad teen bhed the or namisadhu ke anusaar upanaagar, aabhir or graamy
 These names do not reveal any regional distinction
 vidwaanon ne aabhiron ko vratya kaha he, is prakaar 'brachad' kaa sambandh 'vratya' se mana ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, Abhiri and Brachd were two names of the same dialect
 kramdishwar ne nagar apbhransh or shasak chand kaa sambandh sthapit kiya he
 Sasak verses have been composed mostly in the western regions
 is prakaar apbhransh ke sabhi bhedopabhed pashchimi bharat se hi sambhddha dikhaai padate hai
 Literary obsolescence was the language of Western India in its defined form, but with the spread in other regions, regional characteristics were added to it by nature
 praapt rachanaaon ke aadhaar par vidwaanon ne purvi or dakshini do anya kshetreey apbhranshon ke prachlan kaa anumaan lagaaya he
 The structure of the language of Apabhramsa is almost the same, which is found in the fourth chapter of the eighth chapter of Siddhemashabdanushasanam of Hemachandra
 dhvaniparirvan kii jin pravritiyo ke dwaara sanskrit shabdon ke tadbhav rup praakrit main prachlit the, vahi pravritiyaan adhikanshtah apbhransh shabdasmooh main bhi dikhaai padati he, jaise anadi or asamyukt k, ga, c, ja, t, da, pa, ya or va kaa lop tathaa inke sthaan par udvruth swar a athwa ya shruti kaa prayog
 Similarly, like Prakrit, in place of the combined consonants, there were also 'kat', 'kk', 'dd' etc
 in apabhramsa
 parantu apbhransh main kramshah samitavarti udvruth swaron ko milakar ek swar karne or dwittavyanjan ko saral karke ek vyanjan surakshit rakhane kii pravriti badhati gai
 Similarly, Apabhramsa had some more distinct phonation from Prakrit
 apbhransh karkrchana main vibhaktiyaan praakrit kii apeksha adhik ghisi hui milti hai, jaise tritiya ekvachan main 'en' kii jagah 'ein' or shashthee ekvachan main 'ssa' ke sthaan par 'ha'
 In addition to this, apabhransh is also practiced by unobstructed noun forms
 sahu, kehin, tehin, desi, tanen, kese, majzi aadi parasarg bhi prayukt hue
 The tendency to use participle verbs increased and the construction of joint verbs began
 sankshep main apbhransh ne nae subanton or tishanton kii sristi kii
 Most of the received works of Apabhransh literature are Jain poetry, that is, the creators were Jain and the management and liberation of all poetry is inspired by Jain philosophy and Puranas
 sabase pracheen or shreshth kavi swayambhu hai jinhone ram kii katha ko lekar 'paum-chariu' tathaa 'mahabharat' kii rachana kii he
 The second great poet is Pushpadanta, who has portrayed the great poetry of the Jain tradition in a large poem called 'mahapuran'
 isamen ram or krishna kii bhi katha sammilit he
 In addition, Pushpadanta has also composed two small figures like 'nayakumarchariu' and 'jasharchariu'
 tisare lokapriy kavi dhanpal hai jinaki 'bhavissyatt kaha' shrutapanchami ke avasar par kahi janevaali lokprachlit pracheen katha he
 Kanakamar Muni's 'karkanduchariu' is also a notable feature
 apbhransh kaa apana dulaara chand doha he
 Just as Prakrit is called 'gahabandha' because of 'gatha', similarly Apabhransh is called 'dohabandh'
 footkal dohon main anek lalit apbhransh rachanaayen hui hai, jo indu kaa 'parmatmaprakash' or 'yogasar', ramsingh kaa 'pahood doha', devsen kaa 'savyadhamm doha' aadi jain muniyon kii gyanopadeshparak rachanaayen adhikashantah doha main hai
 Apabhramsa couplets of Prabandhchintamani and Hemachandrachit grammars show that the adhik muktakas of Shringar and Shaurya are also written in considerable numbers
 kuch raasak kavy bhi likhe gaye hai jinamein kuch to 'upadesh rasayan raas' kii tarah nitant dharmik hai, parantu addahamaan ke sandeshraasak kii tarah shringaar ke saras romance kavy bhi likhe gaye hai
 Apart from Jains, Buddhist Siddhas have also composed in Apabhramsa, in which the Dohakosh of Sirhapa, Kanhapa etc
 are important
 apbhransh gadhy ke bhi namoonay milte hai
 Pieces of prose are scattered throughout the 'kuvalayamala Kaha' of Udyotan Suri
 naveen khojon se jo saamagree saamne aa rahi he, usase pataa chalata he ki apbhransh kaa sahitya atyant samrudh he
 Apabhramsa texts have been received around one hundred and fifty of which about fifty are published
 apbhransh - aadhunik arya bhashaa tathaa upbhasha It is clear from the above description that Hindi language originated from the Shaurseni, Ardhamagadhi and Magadhi forms of Apabhramsa

 It refers to company-level marketing practices across the border, including strategic decisions, market identification and targeting, entry mode selection and marketing mix to compete in the international market

" vipanan kii paribhaasha kii paraspar tulana main keval shabd bahurashtriya joda gaya he
 In simple terms, international marketing is the application of marketing principles across national boundaries

 It follows that global marketing takes a more standardized approach to the world market and focuses on equality, in other words, equality among consumers and regions
 katoraa or gauri antarrashtriya vipanan un vyapaar gatividhiyon kaa kaary-sampadan he jo munaafe ke liye ek se adhik desh main upabhoktaaon yaa prayoktaaon ke liye ek company kii vyapaarik vastuon or sevaaon ke pravaah kaa nirdesan karata he
 'international marketing is often not as simple as marketing your product to more than one country
 jis bazaar main companiyaan ja rahi hai, unhen vahaan ke bhashaa-avrodh, adarshaswarupon or reeti-rivaajon par vichaar karnaa chahie
 Adapting your marketing strategies to attract a particular group of people that you are trying to sell is extremely important and can become the number one cause of failure or success
 jaisaa ki vipanan ke anya tatwon ke saath he, antarrashtriya vipanan kii koi ek paribhaasha nahin he
 In addition, some authors define international marketing and global marketing differently
 yah antarrashtriya vipanan ke vibhinn staron ke bich pratishthit kiya ja saktaa he: "iske saralatam str par, antarrashtriya vipanan main company kaa rashtriya simaaon ke paar ek yaa adhik vipanan mishran nirnay lenaa shaamil hota he 
iske sabase jatil str par, company kaa rashtriya simaaon ke paar vipanan ranneetiyon ko samanvit karnaa or samudr paar suvidhaon kaa nirmaan sthapit karnaa shaamil he

" yah "antarrashtriya vyapaar ke liye vipanan abhivinyas env vipanan kshamtaaon ke anuprayog " ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 "" The international market goes beyond the export vendor and becomes more allied to the marketing environment of the countries in which it is trading

 "" Global marketing refers to marketing activities integrated and integrated across multiple country markets
 " According to Kotabe, the following topics incorporate micro-references to international marketing
 sanghathanaatmak or upabhokta vyavhaar: Marketing Entry Decision: sthaneey bazaar vistaar: vipanan mishran nirnay: Global Strategy: cross-rashtriya anusandhan ke kshetra main vishleshnatmak takneekein: There are various differences between domestic marketing and international marketing

 Promotional messages need to consider the countless cultural differences between different countries
 isamen bhashaa, bhaavon, aadaton, ishaaron, vichaardhaaraon or anya main antar shaamil hai
 For example, in the United States, the round o sign made of the thumb and the first three fingers means "OK" when in the Mediterranean countries this same gesture means "zero" or "worst of all"
 In Tunisia, it is understood as "i'll kill you", meanwhile, for a Japanese consumer, it means "money"
 Even among 74 English-speaking countries, words with similar meanings may differ significantly from English spoken in the United States, as the following examples show: galworth nirupan ke haal ke teen antarrashtriya udhaaharan hai: After deciding to invest, the exact method of operation has to be determined
