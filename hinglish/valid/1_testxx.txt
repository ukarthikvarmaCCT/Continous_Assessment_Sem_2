 Socialist ideology was fast gaining hold
 wiliam thamsan jaise buddhijivi loktantric samaajwaad kii nai vyakhyaayein garh rahe the
 The series of new experiments on cooperatives had begun
 mazdooron ke sanghathan banane lage the
 Taking the socialist ideology as the basis, the newly emerged Chartists had made up their mind to climb the stairs of power through agitational struggle
 unhone ek ke baad ek teen badi hadataalen karke sarkaar ke saamne mushkilen khadi kar di thim
 Which made him feel that he would soon be able to achieve the goal of change very easily by riding on power
 oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyon kaa lagaataar avsaan ho rahaa tha
 It is important to note that this concept of ideal-oriented society by Owen was not new or unique
 naa hi vaisaa sapana dekhne vaala vah akelaa buddhijivi-vichaarak tha
 Rather Plato had conceptualized such an ideal-oriented society about two and a half years ago
 jaan kalvin, thomas moore, ruso aadi ne bhi adarsh samaaj ko lekar kuch isi prakaar kii sadhu-sankalpanaaen kii thim
 If Owen had surpassed his earlier thinkers, it was because he was not a blank theorist, but a true and determined man who embodied ideas
 is tarah kuch maamalon main vah moulik bhi tha
 Not only did he dream of a society based on classlessness and equality, he also did many successful experiments to achieve his goal
 yah baat alag he ki sudhaar kaaryakramon main use jo kamyaabi prarambh main mili, vah baad main lagaataar ghatati chali gai

 lekin macrsvaadi vichaarak oven ke saare abhiyaan ko andeh kii drushti se dekhte hai
 Fredrik Angles himself, suspecting Owen's intentions, has accepted him as a pseudo-socialist
 anglas ke anusaar- For proof, Anglus mentions an expression of an Owen in his article, which reflects Owen's conceit
 oven ne badi budhimattapurvak, kaha jaae ki vyavsaayik kushalta kaa parichay dete hue mazdooron ko kuch suvidhaayen di thim
 What he received in return was several times the cost incurred
 is baat ko oven ke sahitya se hi udhaaharan lekar fadrik anglas samajhaate hai ki- Fear is a negative emotion

 kuch logon main dar kaa vikaas seekhney se hota he
 It is read in psychology as fear conditioning
 bhay anubhav yaa dardanaak durghatana dekhne se siikhaa ja saktaa he

 Fear is also influenced by cultural and historical context
 udhaaharan ke liye, bisvi sadi main, bahut se americanyon ko polio se dar lagata tha
 People's reactions to fear arise from persistent cross-cultural differences
 iske baavjood kii dar siikhaa jaataa he, darane kii kshamta maanav swabhaav kaa hissaa he

 Meditation calms you down and gives you inner strength to face any situation
 dhyaan aapaki chintaa kam karne main madad karata he
 Our worst imagination and anxiety is when we are surrounded by fear in our mind
 dar se bachane ke liye sabase sahi tarika yah he ki ham apni kalpana par thodaa sa niyantran rakhen
 Many of us do not like fear because fear cripples us
 lekin agar aap bas apane aap ko bhay mahasoos karne kii anumati den to, aap khud dekhenge ki vah sthiti prabandhaneey he

 vidyut shakti ke kisi strot ko saamaanya rup se vidyut pradaayi yaa 'vidyut pradaayak' yaa 'power supplai' kaha jaataa he
 The term is mostly used in the context of electrical power supply; It is rarely used in terms of mechanical strength; It is almost never used in the context of other energy
 
 Technically, power supply is a device that provides power / energy from one source of electrical energy in the required format to another device
 udhaaharan ke liye mobile ko charge karne ke liye prayukt koi power supplai kisi 230 volt, 50 hertz ke asi strot se vidyut urja lekar lagbhag 4 volt disi uplabdh karaati he jise mobile se jod dene se vah lagbhag 150 mili ampear vidyut dhara lekar apni bydaree ko aaweshit kar letaa he
 In fact it is more meaningful to call it a "power changer" than to call it a "power supply"
 voltage regulator, computer kii power supplai, tivi kii power supplai, inwarter, welding kii shakti aapurti, anwarat shakti aapurti, bydaree, kritrim upgrah kii shakti aapurti, mobile phone kii shakti aapurti, prayogshaala main prayog aane vaali shakti aapurti aadi Electric power supplies can be classified in many ways
 vidyut shakti aapurti ke andar sthit power swichon ke kaary karne ke bhang ke aadhaar par shakti aapurti uniten mukhyat: do prakaar kii hoti hai- Power supplies are of four types depending on the nature of the input and output of the power supply
 yah hindi pustakon ke ek pramukh prakaashak hai
 Knowledge related to the transformation and control of electric power using solid-state electronics is called power electronics
 shakti electronic ke kaaran vidyut urja ke kshetra main krantikari parivartan hue hai
 Today, drives are available to drive motors ranging from 10 watts to several hundred megawatts
 6 jigawatt tak kii vidyut shakti lagbhag 1000 kilovolt ke ucch-voltata disi pareshan ke madhyam se transmit kii ja sakati he
 Trains, elevators, and cranes are all running smoothly through power electronics
 akshay urja ke sroton ke vidyut grid se jodne main shakti electronic kaa hi haath he
 Even radar systems rely on power electronics
 yadhyapi shakti electraniki main chote-mote sabhi electronic avyav prayukt hote hai, kintu nimnlikhit avyavay shakti electraniki ke vishishti pahchaan hai- Work in the field of power electronics was preceded by miniature-signal electronics
 sabase pehle vidyut shakti ke niyantran tathaa parivartan ke liye vidyut mashiinon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 This was followed by the Mercury Arc Rectifier
 tatpashchaat nirvaat evam gas-bhare vaalvon kaa yug aayaa
 The development of SCR in 1957 gave a new direction to Shakti Electronics
 aajkal esasiaar, jitio, bijetti, mossphate, aijibiti aadi swichon ke prayog se atyant dakshata purvak vidyut-shakti kaa parivartan kiya jaataa he
 Due to this, the field of power electronics has become very wide and important
 electraniki vigyaan kaa vah vibhaag he jisamen electron naliyon kaa athwa usee tarah kaa kaary karne vaale ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti ko vaanchit voltata, aavriti, dhara main dakshatapurvak badla jaataa he
 The fact is that electric power is used very rarely in the form we receive
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi udyog ko vidyut shakti 415 volt, 50 hertz asi ke rup main milti he
 It has to be electrocuted for which 0 to 20 volts DC is required, from which zero to 1200 ampere current will flow
 spasht he ki hamen jo vidyut praapt ho rahi he use sidhe is kaary ke liye upyog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa, balki use badalanaa padegaa
 This work is done by Shakti Electronics
 vastav main aise hajaaron udhaaharan hai jahaan vidyut shakti ko jyon kaa tyon upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa balki kisi duusare rup main badalanaa padataa he
 Important uses of electronic devices are: aajkal ke kai atiprachlit yantra bhi bina electraniki ke ban nahin pate, jaise radio, doordarshan, chalchitr, pratidipti prakaash, jan-vyaakhyaan-pranali, telephone aadi
 All these tips are the result of electronics
 electraniki ke kuch audyogic upyogon ke vishay main sankshep main neeche likh ja rahaa he : Inductors are often used in industries, by which the alternating current is converted into a specified current
 ve praaia: nimnlikhit main se ek prakaar ke hote hai : The use of multicomponent circuitous circuits in high power compensation is more profitable for several reasons than neglecting the use of single circuitry circuits
 pratham kaaran yah he ki aajkal vidyutiya shakti kaa utpaadan tathaa vitaran tri-kala-shakti ke rup main hota he
 The second reason is that the voltage generated by the polynomial bifurcation is more even than the voltage produced by the single bifurcation
 uparyukt ucchashakti rujukari main yaa to anek dhanagron ke liye ek hi runagra rahata he yaa anek dhanagar rujukari, jinke runagra jude rahete hai, prayog main laae jate hai
 Both types of minuscule are used
 motor kii chaal kaa niyantran kaagaj ke milon main vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he, kyonki chaal par hi kaagaj kii motaai nirbhar rahati he
 In these devices, the electric current of the exciter field is changed, which produces the controlling area for the generator
 yah janitr ek prime mover dwaara chaalit hota he
 The armature of the generator gives its output to the motor whose speed has to be controlled
 ek dashti-dhara-janitr is motor dwaara chalaaya jaataa he; vah apni chaal ke samaanupaat main voltata utpann karata he
 If that voltage is different from predetermined voltage then it activates a regulator
 yah niamak iksiter ke kshetra main aisa parivartan laa detaa he ki motor kii chaalu purvanishchit maan par aa jaae
 Many tubes are used in this regulator
 is prakaar electraniki kii sahaayta se motor kii chaal kaa niyantran atisookshm maan tak kiya ja saktaa he
 Industrial Uses of High Frequency Heating - Extremely powerful high frequency generators are being used a lot in heating by cross electrification and motivation
 jab kisi parvidyut ko sandharitra ke do patton ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he or sandharitra ko ek shaktishaalee ucch aavriti utpaadak se sambhddha kar diya jaataa he, to ek hanidhara ke kaaran parvidyut kaa taap bad jaataa he or hawa pighalane lagata he
 This type of rule is also for heating by inspiration
 ye yuktiyaan saadhaaran garam karne kii apeksha adhik laabhadaayak hai
 Electricity is used a lot in the industry to heat objects
 is vidhi se kaary bahut svachh hota he tathaa khuli hui jwaala upasthit nahin rahati
 The method of heating metals is called induction-heating and the method of heating non-conductive materials is called electro-heating
 in donon vidhiyon ke liye ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wrap a coil around the piece of metal to be heated and alternating current in it
 vidyut-pravaah se utpann chumbakeey syand vaayu main se tathaa kundali ke sameep upasthit dhaatu main se bhi hokar jaataa he
 The reversal of the current also changes the wind, which causes the voltage in the metal to be induced
 is voltata ke kaaran dhaatu main adhik maatra main bhanvar dhara kaa pravaah hone lagata he
 The heat is then generated due to the resistance of the metal
 vidyut se achaalak padaarthon ko tapt karne ke liye 1,000 kilocycle yaa 1 megacicle se adhik aavriti kii shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since current cannot flow through the object, the object is placed between high-voltage metal plates
 vidyut kshetra ke teevr parivartan ke kaaran achaalak vastu kii anu-saranchana main bhi vaise hi parivartan hone lagate hai
 Due to friction between molecules, the same temperature is produced everywhere in the object
 is vidhi se achaalak vastuon kii moti chaadaron ko bahut thode samay main tapt kiya ja saktaa he
 They can be compacted by moving high currents in two pieces of metal, ie, the machine has a capacitance converter, which converts 1 to 10 voltmeters from between two electrical currents of 220 or 440 volts
 And at the same time gives high electrification
 sandhan karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki dhara kaa pravaah alp samay ke liye hi ho
 a contact-circuit is used by this
 yah yukti paripath ko sheeghra-sheeghra jodatii or todatii rahati he
 The contact-circuit uses an electron tube called the "ignitron"
 ignitron ek vishesh prakaar kii gas-yukt nalee hoti he, jo ucch vidyut-dhara ko sanbhaal sakati he
 Its use is similar to a thyratron tube

 Tropical moist forests include many different types of forest
 The best known and most extensive are the lowland evergreen broadleaf rainforests include, for example: the seasonally inundated varzea and igapó forests and the terra firme forests of the Amazon Basin; the peat forests and moist dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia; and the high forests of the Congo Basin
 The forests of tropical mountains are also included in this broad category, generally divided into upper and lower montane formations on the basis of their physiognomy, which varies with altitude

 The Common Gateway Interface CGI is a standard protocol for communicating with an external application software reporting server, which is typically a web server
 is soochna dene vaale sarwar kaa kaary, output / parinaam ke dwaara anurodh kaa jawaab dena he
 Each time a request is received, the server analyzes the request and provides an appropriate answer

 When a request for a URL is received, the program associated with it is run

 This is in contrast to typical operations where command line arguments are used
 HTTP PUT yaa POST, ke maamle main, upyogkarta dwaara daalaa gaya data maanak input ke madhyam se program ko uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he
 The web server consists of a cgi-bin directory based on the directory tree which stores the executable files sought by CGI

 Only they can decide this
 sabhi grah ek saath raja vikramaditya ke paas pahunche, or apana vivaad bataaya
 Also asked for decision
 raja is samasya se ati chintit ho uthe, kyonki ve jaanate the, ki jis kisi ko bhi chota bataaya, vahi kupit ho uthegaa
 tab raja ko ek upaay soojha
 unhone suvarna, rajat, kaansya, pital, sisa, ranga, jasta, abhrak or louh se nau singhaasana banawaaye, or unhen isi kram se rakh diye

 He got angry and said to the king, "king! You do not know me Sun moves in one zodiac month, moon one and a quarter to two months, Mars one month, Jupiter thirteen months, and Buddha and Venus rotate one month each
 But i live for two and a half to seven and a half years
 i have destroyed the elders
 He got exiled when Shri Ram's half-and-half came, his Lanka was defeated by the army of monkeys when Ravana came
 Now you be careful
 Saying this, Shanidev went away from there
 The other gods happily went away
 kuch samay baad raja kii saadhe saati aayi
 Then Shani Dev came there as a horse trader
 unke saath kai badhiya ghode the
 The king, hearing this news, ordered his ashwalpala to buy good horses
 usne kai achche ghode kharide va ek sarvottam ghode ko raja ko sawari hetu diya
 As the king sat on it, the horse ran towards the gallop forest
 Reaching the Bhishan forest, he became impatient, and the king wandered hungry thirsty
 tab ek gwaale ne use pani pilaayaa
 raja ne prasann ho kar use apni anguthi di
 He gave the ring and went to Raja Nagar, and there he named his name Vika, a resident of Ujjain
 vahaan ek seth kii duukaan main usne jal ityadi piya
 or kuch vishram bhi kiya
 Luckily Seth got a big sale that day
 seth use khaanaa ityadi karaane khush hokar apane saath ghar le gaya
 There he saw on a peg, that a necklace was hanging, which the peg was swallowing
 thodi der main puraa haar gaayab tha
 Seth then noticed that the necklace was missing
 usne samajha ki vikaa ne hi use churaayaa he
 He catches Vika near Kotwal
 phir raja ne bhi use chor samaj kar haath pair katwa diye
 He became Chowringia
 or nagar ke baahar phinkava diya gaya
 a Teli was coming from there, who felt pity, and seated Vika in his car
 vah apni jeebh se belon ko haankane laga
 The Saturn condition of that period king ended

 Then he liked the princess Manabhavani of the town where he was, so much that he made up his mind, that she would marry the person who sing that raga
 usne daasi ko dhundne bheja
 Maid told that she is a Chowringia
 parantu rajkumaari naa maani
 As soon as she woke up from the very next day, she sat on hunger strike, that if she would get married to him
 use bahutera samajhane par bhi jab vah naa maani, to raja ne us taili ko bula bheja, or vivaah kii taiyaari karne ko kaha
 He was then married to the princess
 tab ek din sote hue swapn main shanidev ne raja se kaha: rajan, dekha tumne mujhe chota bataa kar kitna dukh jhela he
 Then the king apologized to them, and prayed, o Lord, do not give anyone else the same sorrow as Shani Dev
 shanidev maan gayi, or kaha: jo meri katha or vrath kahegaa, use meri dasha main koi dukh naa hoga
 The person who will always meditate on me, and will add flour to the ants, will have all his desires fulfilled
 saath hi raja ko haath pair bhi waapas diye
 When the princess saw her eyes open in the morning, she was surprised
 vikaa ne use bataaya, ki vah ujjain kaa raja vikramaditya he
 Everyone was very happy
 seth ne jab suna, to vah pairon par gir kar kshamaa maangane laga
 The king said that he was the wrath of Shanidev
 isamen kisi kaa koi dosha nahin
 Seth still pleaded, that i will get peace only when you walk and eat at my house
 seth ne apane ghar naanaa prakaar ke vyanjanon se raja kaa satkar kiya
 At the same time everyone saw that the peg that had swallowed the necklace was now spewing it out
 seth ne anek moharen dekar raja kaa dhanyavad kiya, or apni kanya shrikanwari se panigrahan kaa nivadan kiya
 The king gladly accepted
 kuch samay pashchaat raja apni donon raaneeyon manabhaavani or shrikanwari ko sabhi dahej sahit lekar ujjain nagari ko chale
 The people there welcomed him on the border
 saare nagar main deepamala hui, va sabane khushi manaayi
 The king announced that i had called Shani Dev the youngest, whereas in reality he is the paramount

 Panic attacks are periods of intense fear or panic that occur suddenly and are of relatively short duration
 ghabdaahat ke daure aam taur par achaanak shuru hote hai, 10 minute ke andar charam avasthaa tak pahunch jate hai or mukhyatah 30 minute ke dsam-iv ke andar khatm ho jate hai
 Panic attacks can last from a short duration of 15 seconds to sometimes lasting for hours or even recurring
 american psychological association ke anusaar, un paristhitiyon main jahaan pehle bhi daure pad chuke hai, peedit vyakti aksar dauron ke bich gambhir purvaabhaasi ashanka or simit lakshan vaale dauron kaa anubhav karte hai
 The effects of panic attacks vary
 kuch, vishesh rup se pehali-baar ke peediton ko apatkaaleen sevaaon kii aavashyaktaa pad sakati he
 Many people who experience panic attacks, most often for the first time, have a fear of a heart attack or nerve blockage
 kaha jaataa he ki ghabdaahat ke daure kaa anubhav,kisi vyakti kii jindagi ke sabase bhayaavah, kshtprad or asahaj anubhavon main se ek hota he
 People who experience panic attacks often experience a type of fear or death, "going crazy" or a heart attack or "full-blown vision" or have a feeling of fainting or nausea, the whole body
 i may experience numbness, shortness of breath or feeling like losing control over yourself
 kuch logon ko tunnel vijan kaa bhi anubhav hota he jo zyaadaatar rakt pravaah ke sir kii ore hone kii bajaay rakshaatmak rup se sharir ke adhik mahatvapurn hisson kii ore hone ke kaaran hota he
 Such experiences may increase the intense desire to leave or run away from the place where the seizures began in which the hormones that cause this reaction are released in considerable amounts
 yah pratikriya sharir ko khaas taur par epinephrine hormonon se bhar detii he jo nuksaan ke khilaaf bachaav main isaki madad karte hai
 Panic attack is a sensitive nervous system response
 sabase saamaanya lakshanon main kampan, shwaas ksht, hriday spandan, chaati kaa dard, hot flashes, cold flashes, jalan kaa anubhav, pasinaa, michali, chakkar aana, sir main halkaapan mahasoos hona, saansen tej chalanaa, apsamvednaa, sanson main rukaawat yaa dam ghutane kii anubhuti or samaj kamjor ho janaa shaamil ho sakate hai
 These physical symptoms are considered as a warning in a person with panic attacks
 iske parinaam swaroop vyagrata bad jaati he or ek sakaaratmak pratikriya kaa abhaav ho jaataa he
 Short breath and chest pain are often the main symptoms; The victim wrongly perceives the signs or symptoms of a heart attack
 iske kaaran ghabdaahat ke daure kaa anubhav karne vaale vyakti ko ek apatkaaleen kaksh main ilaaj kii jarurat hoti he
 Panic attacks can be distinguished from other forms of anxiety based on their intensity and their sudden, serial nature
 inhen aksar vyagrata sambandhi vikaron or anya manovaigyanik paristhitiyon ke saath sanyukt rup se anubhav kiya jaataa he, haalanki ghabdaahat ke daure aam taur par maansik vikaar ke sanket nahin hote hai
 Almost all antidepressants in the SSRI class can cause increased anxiety at the beginning of use
 anubhavheen upyogkartaaon, visheshkar jo log vyagrata ke prati samvedansheel hote hai unke liye dawaaon ko lene or chhodane ke kram main ghabdaahat ke daure padana asaamaanya nahin he
 It can be difficult for a person with a heart problem to differentiate between heart disease and anxiety symptoms
 sipiviti main vyagrata swayan hi arithmia ko trigar kar saktaa he or karata he
 The current management of panic attacks in the secondary state of cardiac problems appears to be benzodiazepines; Selective serotonin reuptake relies heavily on inhibitors and / or cognitive behavioral treatments
 haalanki is samooh ke logon ko aksar kai baar or anivaary rup se aspataal main bhartee karana padataa he; is tarah ke lakshan vaale logon main ek electrocardiogram ke bina ghabdaahat ke dauron ke lakshanon ke saamne hriday sambandhi samasyaon ke lakshanon ke bich antar kar paanaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Although many of the symptoms of panic attacks can make the sufferer feel that their body is failing, in fact it is protecting itself from harm
 ghabdaahat ke daure ke kai lakshanon ko is prakaar se samajha ja saktaa he
 First, it often has a sudden onset of fear with little stimulus
 yah adrenaline ke srav kaa kaaran banataa he jo tathakthith fite-yaa-flite arthath ladanaa yaa bhaagna pratikriya ko janm detaa he jisamen vyakti kaa sharir kathor shaareerik gatividhi ke liye taiyaar hota he
 This increases the heart rate, makes the breath faster, which can be seen as small breaths and sweating
 Because strenuous physical activity rarely works, hyper ventilation leads to a drop in carbon dioxide levels in the lungs and subsequently in the blood
 isse rakt main piech kii maatra badal jaati he, jo badale main kai anya lakshanon kaa kaaran ban saktaa he jaise ki siharan yaa samvedanshoonyata, chakkar aana, jalan mahasoos hona or sir main chakkar aana
 iske alaava, ghabdaahat ke daure ke dauraan adrenaline kaa srav vasoconstriction kaa kaaran ban jaataa he jiske parinaam swaroop sir main rakt kaa pravaah thodaa kam ho jaataa he jisase chakkar aane lagata he or sir main halkaapan mahasoos hota he
 a panic attack can cause blood sugar to move away from the brain and toward the major muscles
 yah us tarah ke dauron kii sthiti main bhi sambhav he jahaan vyakti apni sanson ko niyantrit kar paane main aksham mahasoos karata he or ve gahari saansen lenaa shuru kar dete hai jo rakt main carbon dioxide ke str ko bhi kam karne kaa kaam karata he
 DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Attack atyadhik bhay yaa asuvidha kii ek asatat avadhi jisamen nimna main se chaar lakshan achaanak viksit hote hai or 10 minute ke bheetar apane charam tak pahunch jate hai: Agoraphobia is a anxiety disorder that arises out of fear of the initial victim experiencing a difficult or embarrassing situation from which it is not possible to survive
 ghabdaahat ke daure aam taur par agoraphobia or ek buree sthiti se batch paane main aksham rahane se jude hote hai
 As a result, people severely suffering from agoraphobia are confined in their homes and experience difficulty in getting out of this "safe place"
 "agoraphobia" shabd greek shabdon agora or phobose kaa ek angreji roopantaran he
 The word "agora" means the place where the ancient Greeks used to gather together and discuss the issues of the city, so it basically applies to any or all public places; However, the motif of agoraphobia is a fear of panic attacks, especially when they occur among people, causing the victim to feel that they have no escape
 saamaajik bhay yaa saamaajik vyagrata ke kaaran hone vaale agoraphobia ke maamle main peedit vyakti saarvajanik rup se pehali baar ghabdaahat ke daure kaa saamana kar bahut adhik pareshaan ho saktaa he
 This translation is the reason for the common misconception that agoraphobia is a fear of open spaces and is not clinically correct
 is tareeke se varnit agoraphobia, vastav main ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar kaa nidaan karte samay ek lakshan kii peshewar tareeke se jaanch karnaa he
 Other symptoms such as obsessive compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress can also lead to agoraphobia, basically any unfounded fear that prevents a person from going out can be the cause of this syndrome
 jin logon ko kinhin khaas paristhiyon main ghabdaahat ke daure pade the, unamem niraadhaar bhay viksit ho sakate hai jinhen in paristhitiyon kaa phobia kaha jaataa he or ye unase bachanaa shuru kar dete hai
 Eventually the level of anxiety about another seizure and the tendency to avoid it can reach a situation where individuals with panic disorder are unable to drive or get out of the house
 is avasthaa main, kaha jaataa he ki vyakti ko agoraphobia ke saath ghabdaahat sambandhi ho saktaa he
 This can be one of the most harmful side effects of panic attacks as it may prevent the afflicted person from seeking treatment in the first condition
 yah note kiya janaa chahie ki 90% se zyada agoraphobic vyakti puri tarah se thik ho jate hai
 People who have recurrent, persistent seizures or who feel severe anxiety about another seizure are reported to have panic disorder
 ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar, aksar achaanak or akaaran hi utpann hone vaale ghabdaahat ke dauron ke kaaran anya prakaar ke vyagrata vikaron se bilkul hi alag hote hai
 Panic attacks can be treated effectively through various interventions, including psychological therapy and medications, evidenced by the fact that cognitive behavioral therapy lasts longer followed by a number of specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
 american psychological association ke anusaar, "zyaadaatar visheshgy is baat par sahamat hai ki sangyanatmak or vyavhaar janya therapy kaa ek sanyukt prayog ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaron ke liye sarvottam upachaar he
 Medications may also prove to be appropriate in some cases
 " upachaar kaa pehla bhaag kaaphi had tak soochna aadhaarit hota he; kai logon ko sirf yah samajhakar kaaphi faaydaa hua he ki ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar vastav main he kya or kitne anya log isse peedit hote hai
 Many people who suffer from panic disorders are concerned that panic attacks mean their "insanity" or that this panic can lead to heart attacks
 'sangyanatmak punargathan' logon ko un vichaaron kii jagah dauron ko kahin adhik yathartwaadee, sakaaratmak tareeke se dekhne main madad karata he
 Many people and therapists with panic attacks recommend breathing in a paper bag as an effective short-term treatment for acute panic attacks
 haalanki anya logon dwaara is upachaar kii aalochana aprabhavi or sambhawatah marij ke liye hanikaarak, yahan tak ki sambhawatah ghabdaahat ke dauron ko or adhik khatarnaak banane ke rup main kii gayi he
 Critics point out that this technique can potentially reduce oxygen levels in the bloodstream and increase carbon dioxide levels, which in turn have been found to be a major cause of panic attacks
 isliye yah pataa lagaana mahatvapurn he ki hyperventilation vastav main prayek maamle main maujuud he yaa nahin
 If this is the case, then balancing the amount of oxygen / CO2 in the blood and / or reestablishing a similar respiratory pattern may be an appropriate treatment that can also be achieved by external exhalation by counting or lukewarm
 is
 ek taaja adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar or kai baar ghabdaahat ke daure kaa saamana kar chuki rajonivrutt mahilaon main agle paanch saalon main dil ke daure yaa stroke kaa khatra teen guna adhik ho jaataa he
 Researchers believe that panic attacks or more precisely the symptoms associated with them may be due to untreated cardiovascular disorders or as a result of cardiovascular stress in patients with panic disorders and multiple panic attacks over a period of years
 In the event of heart damage can occur
 haalanki adhyayan main yah nahin paaya gaya ki ghabdaahat sabandhi vikaar yaa agoraphobia ke bagaiyr ghabdaahat ke dauron ke alag-alag maamle hriday ko turant nuksaan pahunchane kaa kaaran ban sakate hai, naa hi yah sabit ho paaya ki ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar or stroke ke bich aapasi sambandh aakasmik tha, yaa yah ki iske liye kuch dawaaon ke hriday vahini sambandhi prabhaavon ko jimmedaar tharaaya ja saktaa he jo kai ghabdaahat ke vikaar vaale marijon main dekha jaataa he jaise ki esaesarai or benzodigepins
 ghabdaahat ke dauron ke lakshan dil ke daure kii chetavaniyon or purv soochnaaon ko chhipaane vaale ho sakate hai
 Chest pain, shortness of breath, abnormal fatigue and other signs of heart attack should be examined by a physician to identify signs of panic and heart ailments
 ghabdaahat ke dauron kaa ilaaj kara rahe kai log simit lakshan vaale dauron kaa anubhav karne lagate hai
 Such panic attacks are less elaborate, in which less than 4 physical symptoms can be experienced
 ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaron se grast logon ke liye ek baar main sirf ek yaa do lakshanon kaa anubhav karnaa asaamaanya nahin he jaise ki unke pairon main kampan hona yaa saans main takalif hona yaa unke sharir main ek teevr taap kii lahar kaa upar kii ore badhanaa jo estrogen kii kami ke kaaran hone vaale hot flashes ke samaan nahin hota he
 Some symptoms such as tremor in the feet are not significantly different from any normal sensation, so that they can clearly indicate panic attacks
 Other symptoms of this list can also be seen in other people, whether they suffer from panic disorder or not
 ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar main sahi myanon main yah aavashyak nahin he ki ek hi samay main chaar yaa adhik lakshan dikhaai den
 Symptoms, such as completely unfounded panic and rapid heartbeat, may be a sign of panic attacks to a large extent

 The detailed mechanism by which polar ozone holes differ from mid-latitude depletion, but the most important process in both trends is the decomposition of ozone by atomic chlorine and bromine
 The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is the light decomposition of chloro-fluoro-carbon compounds, these compounds are commonly called phreon, as well as the light decomposition of bromo-fluoro-carbon compounds called halons

 The ozone depletion mechanism also increases as cfcs and halons increase
 siefasi or anya kaarak padaarth saamanyatya ozon-riktikaran padaarth kehalaate hai
 Since the ozone layer prevents the most harmful UVB wavelengths of ultraviolet light from entering the Earth's atmosphere, ozone depletion remains a concern throughout the world for the same reason, the Montreal Protocol has been adopted, according to which CF The production of c and halon and other ozone depletion chemicals such as carbon tetra chloride and tri chloro ethane have been banned

 Ozone degradation occurs due to ultraviolet rays
 oxigen ke teenon apper rup ozon-oxigen chakra main shaamil hai:oxigen parmaanu, oxigen gas or ozon gas 
 Ozone is formed in the stratosphere when oxygen molecules decompose by absorbing an ultraviolet photon of wavelength smaller than 240 nm
 yah oxigen ke do parmaanuon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Now atomic oxygen combines with O2 to form O3
 ozon anu 310 or 200 nm, ke bich ke yuvi prakaash ko avashoshit kar letaa he, jisase ozon vibhajit hokar ek oxigen parmaanu or ek O2 anu banaata he
 Now the oxygen atom combines with the oxygen molecule to form the ozone molecule again
 yah ek satat prakriya he jo tab khatm hoti he jab ek oxigen parmaanu ek ozon anu ke saath "punarsanyojit " hokar do O2 anu bana letaa he

 Ozone can be destroyed by a number of free radical catalysts, the most important of which are hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide radicals and atomic chlorine and bromine

 cfcl3 + hν → cfcl2 + Cl ab chlorine or bromine ke parmaanu ozon ke anuon ko kai apghatni chakron ke dwaara nasht kar dete hai
 In the simplest example of such a cycle, a chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule, taking one of its oxygen atoms to form clo and releasing one oxygen molecule
 chlorine monooxide ozon ke duusare anu ke saath kriya karke ek anya chlorine parmaanu or do oxigen anu bana detii he
 The chemical reaction for this gas phase action is as follows: Cl + O3 → clo + O2 clo + O3 → Cl + 2 O2 samgr prabhaav ozon kii maatra main kami kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 More complex systems have been discovered that lead to ozone destruction in the lower stratosphere

 In this reaction it can be removed from the cycle by forming species such as hydrogen chloride and chlorine nitrate

 Whereas organic molecules containing iodine react so rapidly in the lower atmosphere that they do not reach the stratosphere in sufficient quantities
 iske alaava, maatr ek chlorine parmaanu 1 xxrep 5 0 ozon anuon ke saath pratikriya karne main sakasham he
 This fact and the annual amount of free chlorine in the atmosphere by chloro-fluoro carbon demonstrate how dangerous cfcs are to the environment

 In particular, chemists at nasa's Jet Engine Laboratory in Pasadena, California, found in 2007 that heating in the stratosphere
 The spectrum and intensity of radiation present produce a state that is insufficient for the rate of chemical decomposition required to release chlorine radicals, this volume of chlorine radicals is necessary to elucidate the observed rates of depletion of ozone depletion

 As mentioned above, the overall cause of ozone depletion is the presence of chlorine-rich source gases
 In the presence of UV light, these gases decompose and release chlorine atoms, which cause ozone destruction

 Most of the destroyed ozone occurs in the lower stratosphere, in contrast to very little ozone depletion through homogeneous gas phase reactions, which occur initially in the upper stratosphere
 vasant ke ant ke paas garmi dene vaala taapmaana madhya disambar main bhavar ko tod detaa he
 When heated, ozone-rich air flows through lower latitudes, pscs are destroyed, the ozone depletion process stops, the ozone hole is filled
 haalaanki antarctic ozon hole kaa vaishvik ozon ko kam karne main bahut kam prabhaav hota he, yah prati dashak 4% hone kaa anumaan he, chhed ne bahut adhik ruchi paidaa kii he kyon ki: Since the ozone layer absorbs the sun's UVB, the ozone layer depletion can increase the level of surface UVB, causing damage, increasing the likelihood of skin cancer
 yah montrial protocol kaa kaaran tha
 Although ozone depletion of the stratosphere is related to CFC, there is sufficient reason to believe that ozone depletion will increase surface UVB, there is no direct evidence linking ozone depletion to increased skin cancer in humans

 a fact related to this is that the decrease in ozone in the atmosphere will be responsible for the significant increase in UVB levels near the surface
 ozon chhidr ke kaaran sataha UVB main vruddhi vikiran sthaanantaran model gananaaon dvaaraanshik rup se baadhit kii ja sakati he
 But because reliable historical surface UV data is lacking it cannot be measured by direct calculations, although examples of more recent observational measurement programs exist
 kyonki yah samaan parbengni vikiran he jo ozon parat main O2 se ozon kaa nirmaan karata he, santaap mandal kii ozon main apchayan nichle staron par ozon ke prakaash rasinic utpaadan main vruddhi karata he, main) yadhyapi samgr vishleshan ozon ke stambh main fir bhi kami darshaate hai, kyonki nichle str main bani ozon prakritik rup se kam jivan kaal se yukt hoti he, isliye isse pehle yah kshatigrast ozon kii aapurti kar paae, yah nasht ho jaati he
 The main public concern about the ozone hole is the effect of surface UV on human health
 In most places, so far, ozone depletion is only a few percent, with no direct evidence of health damage found in most latitudes
 ozon hole main ucch str kii kami duniya bhar main aam he, prabhaav adhik naatakeey ho sakate hai
 The ozone hole over Antarctica has become so large in some instances that it has reached the southern parts of Australia and New Zealand, according to environmentalists that the increase in surface UV may be significant
 UVB ko twachaa cancer ke sahyogi karak ke rup main saamanyatya sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 In addition, an increase in surface matter increases ozone in the troposphere, which is a risk to human health

 The anti-cancer effects of vitamin d represent a potentially beneficial effect of ozone depletion

 Basic and squamous cell carcinoma - The most common form of skin cancer in humans, basal and squamous cell carcinoma, is related to exposure to UVB
 vah kriyavidhi jiske dwaara you ve bi in canceron ko prerit karti he, use acchhee tarah se samajha ja chukaa he; UVB vikiran ke avasorana diene anu main pirimidin kshar se diamer banate hai, jiske parinamswaroop diene kii pratikruti main trutiyaan aa jaati hai
 These cancers are relatively benign and are sometimes fatal, although treatment of squamous cell carcinoma sometimes requires extensive reconstructive surgery
 jaanwaron ke adhyayan ke parinaamon ko mahamari vigyaan ke aankadon ke saath sanyojit karne par vaigyanikon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki isamen ek pratishat kii kami ai he
 Ozone of the stratosphere will increase the incidence of these cancers by 2%

 ghaatak melanoma - twachaa ke cancer kaa anya rup, ghaatak melanoma, kam aam he lekin adhik khatarnaak he, nidaan kiye gaye maamalon main lagbhag 15% - 20% main ghaatak he
 The relationship between malignant melanoma and ultraviolet irradiation is not yet well known, but it appears that both UVB and UVA are involved
 Experiments on fish show that 90 to 95% of malignant melanomas are caused by UVA and visible radiation
 jabaki oposum par kiye gaye prayog UVB kii adhik bhoomika darshaate hai
 Because of this uncertainty, it is difficult to predict what effect ozone depletion has on the occurrence of melanoma
 ek adhyayan darshata he ki UVB vikiran main ek 10% kii vruddhi purushon main melanoma ko 19% badhaati he or mahilaon main 16% badhaati he
 a study done on people in the southern top of Punta Arenas, Chile, showed that melanoma increased by 56% in seven years and by 46% in non-melanoma skin cancer, with a decrease in ozone and increased UVB levels

 cortical motiyobind - aankh kaa cortical motiyobind or yuvi-b jokhim ke bich sambandh ko bataane vaale adhyayan, jisamen jokhim kaa anumaan lagaaya jaataa he or vibhinn prakaar kii motiyobind anumaan takneekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 a detailed study of UV-B exposure to the eye was done in Chesapeake Bay Watermen, where it was found that the eyes were more exposed to UVB leading to increased cortical opacity
 purv prabhavi gore purushon ko yuvi bi ke sampark main rakhane par paaya gaya ki yah cortical aspashtataa ke pramaan detaa he
 However, data from a population-based study in Beaver Dame suggest that the risk may be limited to men
 biver dame adhyayan main mahilaon main exposar kam tha or purushon main adhik
 or koi sambandh nahin dekha gaya
 Also, no data have been found in African Americans that relate sunlight to cataract risk
 Although the prevalence of other eye diseases is different in different ethnic groups, and cortical opacity is more common in African Americans than whites

 siefasi ne ozon parat ko kis had tak kshati pahunchaai he yah gyaat nahin he or dashakon tak gyaat nahin hoga
 But the decrease in the ozone column has already been identified
 1976 kii ek report ke baad america ke rashtriya vigyaan academy ne nishkarsh niklaa ki vishwasaneey vaigyanik saboot ozon riktikaran pariklpana ko samarthan dete hai, kuch deshon jaise sanyukt rajya america, canada, sweden or norge, ne airosol spray ke dibbe main siefasi ke upyog ko samaapt karnaa shuru kar diya he
 At that time it was considered as the first step towards a more comprehensive regulation policy but in later years, progress in this direction slowed down
