 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration

 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 iske baad sar ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko "gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa maan hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutveey sthiraank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Suppose the code of the Earth is m and there is a body with the code m on its surface
 prithvi kii sanhati yadi uske centre par hi sanghanit maani jaae or prithvi kaa ardhavyas r ho to prithvi dwaara us pind par kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal : According to Newton's Second Movement, the force exerted on a body is equal to the product of the body and acceleration of that body
 at: prithvi ke aakarshan ke prabhaav main mukt rup se giranevaale pind par kaary karanevaala gurutvkarshan bal: Where g is the gravitational acceleration of that body, so arthath g= pind kii ikai sanhati par kaary karanevaala bal
 But from the equation atev gurutvajanit twaran g ko bahudhaa ‘prithvi’ ke gurutvkarshan kii tivrata bhi kehete hai
 The problem of finding the value of gravitation constant g attracted the attention of scientists only after Newton's law of gravity was presented
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki yah prakruti ke mul niyatanko main se ek he or desh, kaal tathaa paristhiti se sarvatha nirpeksh he
 Therefore, it is called universal constant
 saath hi, yah prithvi kii sanhati se bhi sambandhit kiya ja saktaa he 
 Therefore, to know the density and density of the earth, it also requires knowledge of its value
 yah nimnlikhit vivechan se spasht ho jayega : Comparing the equation and in kintu prithvi kii maatra Where d is the mean density of the Earth
 g = g p r3 d / r2= g p r d Ie GD = 3 g / is sutara se yah spasht he ki g yaa d main se ek kaa maan gyaat karne ke liye duusare kaa maan gyaat hona chahie
 Therefore, before finding the density of the earth, it was only natural to attract the attention of scientists towards methods to determine the exact value of G

 Now if a lateral force is also applied to that body by another large natural body, then the lateral force according to Newton's law f = f m m’ / d2 xxrep 25 
 Here m 'is the code of that large natural body and d is the distance between it and the small body

 Its principle is as follows: maan lijie m sanhati kaa koi pind kisi atyant sugrahi tula kii ek bhujaa se kisi taar dwaara latakaaya gaya he
 If the Earth's Code m and radius r, then the gravitational force acting on that body w = g m m / r2 xxrep 12 
 Now if any other heavy body of m code is placed under this body and the distance between the centers of both bodies is d, then due to mutual attraction of both, the first body will bend more down, that is, its weight will increase

 Wanted is a 2008 action film based partly on a comic book short series by Mark Miller of the same title
 is film kaa nirdesan timur bekamambetove ne kiya he or james mcevoy, angelina joli, morgan friman, thomas kreshman, terrence stamp or kanstantin khabensky is film ke mukhya kalakaar hai
 The story of this film revolves around Wesley Gibson, a disgruntled office worker who discovers that he is the son of a professional killer and decides to join a secret organization called The Fraternity , In which his father worked
 april 2007 main iskaa nirmaan kaary shuru hua or check republic main iskaa pehle filmakan kiya gaya or baad main un sets ko chicago kii chhaviyon par adhyaropit kar diya gaya
 The Wanted film was released on 25 June 2008 in the United Kingdom and on 27 June 2008 in the United States, achieving both critical and commercial success
 22 janvari 2009 ko ise do academy puraskaron ke liye namankit kiya gaya: sarvshereshth dhwani sampadan or sarvshereshth dhvanimishran
 Wesley Gibson works with an arrogant boss who had no developmental scope and takes anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid panic attacks and stays with his girlfriend, who cheats on him after reuniting with his close friend
 is
 ek raat aushadhaalay main vesali ko fox naamak rahasyamayi mahila bataati he ki uske pita haal hi main maare gaye ek hatyare the or ab qaatil cross unke peeche he
 Firing between Cross and Fox follows, followed by a car on the streets of Chicago
 gibson ko ek hajaar saal puraane guptaghatak sanghathan da fraternity ke mukhyalay main laayaa jaataa he
 Sloan, the leader of the group, points out that Wesley's panic attack is virtually an untrained expression of a rare supernatural ability; When fatigued, a predominantly increased heart rate and adrenal supernatural force results in speed and reactions
 fraternity use is kshamta par niyantrit karnaa sikhaa sakati he jisase vesali apane pita kii sampati ko hasil karte hue, ek hatyare ke rup main unke naksh-e-qadam par chal saktaa he
 Wesley is initially reluctant and returns to his job, but eventually seizes the opportunity when he sees more than 3 million dollars in his bank account
 vah karyaalay main sabake saamne apane maalik ko fatkaarta he or apane "mitra" bairi ke chehre par kii-board patakata he
 Fox is waiting outside to take him back to Fraternity headquarters - a simple textile mill
 uske baad vesali ko kathor prashikshan diya jaataa he; hamalon ke anya qismon ke alaava vah smoothbor bandook se goli kii disha ko lakshya kii taraf ghumaane kii kala sikhta he
 After that, Wesley sees the loom of fate, a loom that informs who to target, through binary codes hidden in the fabric weaving error
 jinaki pahchaan kargha karwaata he, jahiraa taur par bhavishya main ve vipatti kaa kaaran ban sakate hai, lekin keval slone unhen dekhtaa or naamon ko samajhataa he ki "qismat" kise maarna chaahati he
 Wesley initially hesitates to kill the people
 lekin fox use bataati he ki uske bachapan main ek bhaade ke qaatil ne uske pita ko uske saamne hi jinda jala diya tha- or kahati he ki vah hatyara fraternity ke haathon maaraa janaa tha
 Now its purpose is to prevent such tragedy
 kai niyamit mishnon or cross se mulaakaat ke sanyog ke baad, jisamen vesali kii baanh ek khojane yogya goli se aahat kii jaati he, slone pita kii maut kaa badla lene kii vesali kii ichha ko puraa karne kii anumati detaa he or use cross ke peeche bhejtaa he - lekin gupt rup se fox ko vesali ko maarane kaa mishan yah kehete hue saunpta he ki uskaa naam bhi karghe main aa chukaa he
 Wesley's analysis of the bullet shows that the manufacturer of the bullet was Pekwarski, a resident of East Moravia
 vesali or fox vahaan pahunchate hai or pekwarski ko kabje main lete hai, jo cross ke saath unki baithak kii vyavastha karata he
 Wesley competes alone on a moving train with a cross
 fox ek car churaati he or use rail ke saath takaraati he, jiske chalate rail apni patari se utar jaati he
 After Cross saves Wesley from falling into the valley, Wesley shoots him
 marane se pehle cross bataata he ki vah vesali kaa asli pita he
 Fox confirms the truth and reveals that Wesley was recruited because he is the only person Cross cannot kill
 Fox then reveals an order to kill Wesley and raises his gun, but Wesley escapes by shooting the glass beneath him and leaping into the river below
 vesali ko pekwarski dhundh letaa he or use uske pita ke ghar le jaataa he, jo uske puraane ghar kii gali ke paar rahata he
 Pekwarski explains to him that after Sloan finds himself the target of the loom of fate, the targets for profit begin to form and the members of the Fraternity do not tell that they were now anything other than salaried assassins
 cross ne sach kaa pataa laga liya tha or vah hatyara ban gaya or fraternity ke sadasyon se apane bete ko dur rakhane ke liye unki hatya karnaa shuru kar di
 Pekwarski goes on to say that Wesley's father wanted his son to live a violence-free life
 But Wesley decides to take revenge on Sloan after discovering a secret room containing all of his father's weapons and maps
 fretrenity ke lagbhag sabhi sadasyon kii hatya karne ke baad jab vah slone ke karyaalay main pravesh karata he, to vah kamare main maujuud master hatyaron ke saamne slone ke dhokhe kii pole kholta he
 Sloan then states that all of them came to be named in the weave and that he had only acted to save them
 agar ve code kaa paalan karte hai, to har ek ko maukey par hi khud ko maar dena chahie
 Otherwise they should kill Wesley
 fox jo apane anubhav ke kaaran, dusron se zyaada code par bharosa karti he, apane saathi hatyare kii taraf mudati he or "ghumaav" vaali goli chalaati he jo uske saath-saath kamare main maujuud sabhi fraternity sadasyon ko maar detaa he or keval vesali batch jaataa he
 Sloan manages to escape somehow
 vesali dubaara daridr ho jaataa he or nahin jaan paata ki use kya karnaa chahie
 When Wesley gives a voice, the audience sees a person looking like Wesley sitting in front of the computer, as seen in the opening scene of the film
 slone prakat hota he or us vyakti ke sir ke peeche bandook kaa nishaanaa sadhta he
 At the same time, the man turns back and discovers that he is a pawn to trap him
 uske baad slone ko vesali lambii-duuri kii goli se maar detaa he, jise khoj paanaa mumkin nahin
 Similar to the comic, the film also ends with Wesley turning in the direction of the camera and smashing the fourth wall, saying "this is me, who is taking his life back under control

 Miller described the film's first half as being close to the graphic naval, and stated that the film's ending was the same although the graphic naval setting was set elsewhere

 Ironically, Miller had this objective while writing the graphic Navel, although he and artist JG Jones had forgotten
 unhone kaha "main chahta tha ki unke paas ve shaktiyaan hon or sirf shuruyaat ke liye un poshaakon kaa dhaaran karen lekin sirf ek panel ke liye or phir main bhul gaya tha
 "
 Miller also stated that he also wanted to keep the super villain myth that determines the original comic in the film

 1990 main desh main udaarikaran kii shuruyaat hui or tej aarthik badlaav kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 The younger generation of the country was more interested in motorcycle riding
 license permit raaj main scooter ke liye saalon intjaar karne waalon kaa dhairya chuk gaya tha
 a few years after liberalization, the urban middle class did not hesitate to spend money to pursue its hobbies
 shaharon main motorcycle kaa shauk bad rahaa tha
 Change had already started in the villages
 rajdoot, bullate or bajaj samooh ke scooter nae bharat main peeche chhot rahe the
 Hero Honda was becoming the new beat of the country
 yah badlaav aane vaale saalon main or tej hua
 Both wheels of change in the country were changed
 iske baavjood bharat main cycle kii ahmiyat khatm nahin hui he
 Perhaps this is the reason why India still has the highest number of bicycles in the world after China
 nabbe ke dashak ke baad se cykilon kii bikri ke aankanon main ahm badlaav aayaa he
 There has been an increase in the total sales of bicycles, but sales have fallen in rural areas
 aasaan aarthik praayojan kii badaulat log motorcycle ko in ilaakon main zyada tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Actually, the role of bicycle before 1990 was replaced by motorcycle in villages and cities
 2002-03 main dopahiyaa gadiyon kii bikri jahaan 48
12 lakh thi, vah 2008-09 main badhkar 74
37 lakh ho gai thi
 This means that in the last financial year, as many bicycles sold in the country, two-wheelers were also sold
 bisikil ke vibhinn bhaag nimnlikhit hai : The most important part of a bicycle is its frame
 frem kii banaavat aisi honi chahie ki usapar laganevaale purjein apana kaam kushaltapurvak kar saken
 The bicycle frame's triangular frame and front and back tongs are made of hollow, round tubes
 phir unhen frem ke konon par uchit prakaar ke braketon main phasaakar jhaal diya jaataa he
 Care is taken in making a triangular frame that the middle lines of its tubes remain in the same plane
 frem main laga aage kaa stearing sira, usapar laganevaale handls kaa danthal or aage ke chimate ke danthal kii madhya rekhaayen ek duusari par sampati honi chahie
 The arms of the two tree tongs should also be symmetrical and parallel to their midline
 chakkon kii madhya rekha chimaton kii madhya rekha par sampati honi chahie, anyathaa bisikil santulit rahakar sidhi nahin chal sakegi
 It is the custom nowadays to put the wheels in the tactile direction of the navel
 sparsheey are, pahie ke ghere par bhraamak bal bhalee prakaar se daal sakate hai
 Each of the two adjacent areches are tangential in a tangent direction from the hub's flage
 peeche ke pahie main 40 or agle main 32 are lagate hai, at: usee ke anusaar uske gheron main chhed banaae jate hai or habon kii prayek flanz main ghere kii aadhi sankhya main chhed banaae jate hai
 While preparing the flywheel, Vyasabhimukh corrects the first eight arrows, then fills the remaining ones in the same sequence
 chitron main hub kii bai taraf kii flanz main hi are lagaakar dikhaae gaye hai, jo kram se ghere par visham sankhyankit chhedon main hi baithe he
 In even numbered holes, the flange of the right side will sit, so their places are shown empty
 taar se bane are sadaiv tanaav kii sthiti main rahane ke kaaran taan kehalaate hai
 While using the wheels, the wheels of the wheels should be examined from time to time, no shaft should be loose and under no stress
 ungali se bajaakar sabko dekha jaae to unamem ek si awaz nikalni chahie, anyathaa pahie tede hokar are tuutane lagenge
 Tightening them can be done by turning the nipples on the circle in the proper direction
 bisikil ke acchhee prakaar kaam kar sakane ke liye uske ball beringon kii taraf dhyaan dete rahanaa aavashyak he
 If there is a slight sound from any bearings, then there is definitely a defect in it
 use kholkar uske donon taraf kii goliyon kii ginati kar, kapade se ponchkar saaf chamakaa lijie
 If a bullet is broken, cracked or worn, replace it, then look at the circular grooves and corners of its bowl
 ve ghise, kate, yaa khurdare na hon
 If bad, replace them as well
 yadi uparyukt koi aib na ho tathaa goliyaan bhi ek hi sankhya main tathaa samaan naap kii hon, to usamen tel kii kami samajni chahie
 There should not be any kind of garbage or mud in any part of the bearings
 yah pichley pahie main lagaai jaati hai, jiske dwaara savaar apni ichha or aavashyaktaanusaar bisikil kii chaal ke anupaat ko badal sake
 Nowadays there is more promotion of three-speed gear hubs
 aisi giar naabhi bhi banaai jaati he ki peeche ko, arthath ulataa, pedal chalaane se brake lag jaataa he
 To change gait, the ratio of gait between the chakra chakra and navel is changed by dragging a chain with fine rings between the navel axis
 ise khinchne se naabhi ke bheetar lage guaron kii sthiti badal jaati he
 The rider does the work of pulling the chain with force by his liver, but the action of returning is done automatically by the segmental position in the navel
 naabhi ke purje kholane ke liye, pehle baayein haath kaa cone kholkar, phir daahine haath kii taraf lagi goliyon kii ring kholani chahie
 By putting it on the rear wheel, the rider can stop moving whenever he wants to, yet the wheel can continue to spin freely
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he, ek to gharshan belan yukt or doosraa ratchet daant yukt
 Each free wheel should have the quality that the inner parts are stuck on the chain of the pedal, and when the pedals are run again, the inner parts work together and do not slide
 saath hi chakra kii banaavat dhul or pani ke liye abhedya honi chahie
 Nowadays there is more prevalence of ratchet tooth free cycle
 iske ghere kii bhitari paridhi par ratchet ke daant kate hai, jinamein yathasthaan lagaae kute atakkar, pedal kii zanjeer ke madhyam se savaar dwaara die hue khinchaav ko pahie kii naabhi par pareshit kar dete hai
 The paddle stops chained as soon as it stops, and the dogs fall back and forth into the ratchet's teeth with the force of the segmental, causing the sound of "cuttings"
 yadi dubaara chalaane par mukt chakra phisalane lage, athwa jam ho jaae, to use thik karne kii pehali tarkeeb yah he ki usamen mitti kaa tel khub bharkar pahie ko khaali ghumaya jaae, jab vah sab tel nikal chuke tab usamen snehan tel de diya jaae
 If the Ab is not far, then the lid of the Chakra should be opened to see if the dogs have been eroded, or their commands have been broken
 phir use bheetar se bilkul saaf kar toote purje yaa goliyaan nai badalakar, dhakkan kii chudiyaan saavdhaanee se sidhi kas deni chahie
 To hold the tire on the wheel circle, it is made of either steel wire, or a hard knot of rubber on both sides of the wheel, which is clamped under the folded edge of the wheel and stuck to the inner rubber tube When the air is filled, the tire gets diluted and sits in place
 bhitari nalee main itani hi daab se hawa bharani chahie jisase tair savaar kaa bojha sah le or pahie kaa gheraa sadak ke kankad pattharon se nahin takaraae, anyathaa nalee ke kuchle jane or tair ke fat jane kaa dar rahegaa
 Overloading the tire reduces the flexibility of the tire to bounce on the bicycle road, but tightly inflating the required amount increases the diameter of the wheel to its limit and less power than the pedals when running on good roads Has to be imposed
 bhitari nalee main hawa bharne ke liye bud ke hawa valb kaa bahudhaa prayog hota he, jisaki banaavat chitra 13
 main spasht dikhaai gai he
 The rubber wall tube should not be torn, crushed and rotten
 balve ke plag ke upree sire par laganevaali topi sadaiv lagi rahani chahie
 The base of the balves should be tightened tightly on the nut circle
 balve kaa plag, rabar ke balve tub sahit bina rukaawat ke pravisht hokar, khaanchon main baith janaa chahie
 Paddle cracks are attached to their axles by cotters only
 bisikil ke girane, athwa durghatana ke kaaran, yadi crack yaa dhuree tedi ho jaaen, to krinkon ko juda karne ke liye, unpar lage cotter ke nat ko kholkar, kater ke chudeedaar sire ko hathode se thonk kar cotter ko nikaal lenaa chahie, lekin dhyaan rahe ki chudiyaan kharaab na ho jaaen
 Cotters should be applied only after applying any iron under the chest of the crank, otherwise the crank will hit the spindle or ball bearings
 kharabi ke kaaran yadi donon crank ek sidh main na hon, to cotter ke chapate bhaag ko retkar, yaa palatakar, samanjit kar dena chahie
 If the crank is loose on its axis, pushing the cotter to a greater depth is also useful
 bahut dinon tak deele cotter se hi bisikil chalaate rahane se cotter or crank kaa chhed, donon hi, cat jate hai tathaa dhuree kaa khaanchaa bhi bighad jaataa he
 So it is better to change the new couture
 bisikil ke girane se akasar pedal pin bhi tedi ho jaati he
 In such a condition, take off the cap of the waring on the outside of the pedal and take out the cone cone and take the tablets in your hand
 phir pedal kii frem ko sarkaakar, bhitaravale vering kii goliyaan bhi samhaalkar le leni chahie, aisa karne par pedal nikal aayega or padalpin hi crank main lagi rah jaaegi
 After inspecting it and straightening it into the moon, the pedal should be tied up as necessary
 yah zanjeer choti choti pattinuma kadiyon, belanon or rivaton dwaara banaai jaati he
 It should be cleaned, greased with oil and mixed with its stretch and kept in good condition
 zanjeer ke rivatiy jodon ke deele hone tathaa belanon ke ghis jane se uski samgr lambaai bad jaaya karti he
 The pitch of the teeth of the pedal tread wheel does not change, so it hurts by descending from the chain wheel
 isaki pahichaan yah he ki patr par chadhi hui zanjeer ke sparshachaap ke bich main, use anguthe or tarjani se pakadakar baahar kii taraf khinchaa jaae
 If the chain is stretched only about an inch, then it is fine and if it is stretched by an inch, it must have slipped and loosened
 at: badal deni chahie
 The function of manual brakes that pressurize the wheels is based on the connection of the levers and poles
 bauden ke brake, ispaat kii lacheelee nalee main lage ek atampidya taar ke khinchaav par aadhaarit hote hai
 The segregation works to free the brakes
 brake, suraksha kaa pradhan upkaran he, at: brake ke danda susamanjit rahane chahie, arthath aise rahane chahie ki ve aron yaa tiron main na ataken
 The poles should be strong and easy to rotate on the joints
 dekhne main achche or purjein saaf suthere bhi rahane chahie
 Birsa Munda Airport is the airport in Jharkhand

 All theoretical and applied aspects of measurement are studied in metrology or metrology
 yah maapan evam uske anuprayogon kaa vigyaan he
 Metrology is the branch of physics in which we have knowledge about pure measurement
 maapvigyaan main mul rup se ham teen rashiyon, arthath dravyaman, lambaai evam samay ke bare main charchaa karte hai or inhen teen raashiyon ke gyaan se ham anya raashiyon, jaise ghanatv, aaytan, bal tathaa shakti aadi ko maapte hai
 Non-invariant standards are not only instructed by metrology, but they are also upheld
 inhen maanakon dwaara ham vastuon ke gunon kii maap tathaa tulana bhi karte hai
 The other side is that keeping in view a particular function, metrology provides ways in which comparisons can be made to a very high degree of accuracy
 aadhunik vigyaan tathaa udyogon main uparyukt moulik tulanaaon kaa atyant shuddh hona aavashyak he
 The measurement is not completely correct and there is always some experimental error in it
 aajkal maapvigyaan kii adhik moulik kriyaaon main yatharthata kii nimnlikhit sannikatataayen praapt he: Compared to two platinum iridium samples of international standard kilograms: one part per 10,00,00,000
 saadhaaran rasinic baaton kii tulana main : 10,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to small weights by micrometer Libra: one part in 10,00,00,000

 tarang dairghy prakritik maanak ke rup main -- baad kii pragati ne kaaphi had tak hamaari manyataon main parivartan laa diya he
 First, scientist Michelson's experiments established a natural standard, the wavelength of, which is unanimously assumed that this standard is reproducible with at least as high a level of accuracy as is found in comparisons of fluid parameters
 lekin is maanak kii sarvotkrisht visheshta yah he ki yah dirghakaalik vicharan kii sambhaavna se pare he, jabaki anya sabhi prakaar ke maanakon kaa hi prayog hota he
 In any part of the earth, we can verify fluid parameters with the help of this natural standard
 yadi dravyatmak maanakon ko antarrashtriya kendriya prayogshaala main bhejkar adiprarup meter se tulana karaani hoti he, to avaagaman main use haani pahunchne kii sambhaavna rahati he, kintu prakritik maanak kii sahaayta se ham apni hi prayogshaala main yah kaary kar sakate hai
 The second is that such reforms led to the development of flat-headed standards
 aajkal aise dand bhi prapya hai jinke sire ekadam samaantar hai
 The lengths of such punishments are derived directly from optical interference rather than from the linear standard
 micelson ke vyatikaranmaapi kaa upyog is baat ko jaanane main bhi kiya gaya ki ek maanak meter main kitni prakaash kii tarangen aati he tathaa unki sankhya kya he? micelson ne 150 centegrade taap tathaa 760 mimi0 vayumandal ke dabaav par antarrashtriya meter kaa, jo paris ke paas maap or taul ke antarrashtriya santhaan main rakhaa hua he, maan cadmium kii laal taragon main, gyaat kiya
 This value is 15,53,163
5, which is true up to a limit in 2 ́106
 fabri paro ke baad ke prayogon se gyaat hua ki 15° sein0 tathaa 760 millimetre dabaav par shushk hawa main ek meter main yah sankhya 15,53,164
13 he
 If Michaelsson's experiments are modified to have the effect of water vapor, it is clear that there is no difference in the value of the two
 is baat kaa pramaan he ki dravyatmak maanak gaj apane nirmaankaal se lekar aaj tak sabhavat: 0
0002 inch ghat chukaa he, lekin jahaan tak antarrashtriya adiprarup meter kaa sawaal he vah aparivartit rahaa he
 The experiments of Michelson and Fabry Para have also proved this
 inaki tulana kaa aadhaar cadmium kii laal rekha thi
 All standard meters of matter are made of an alloy, which consists of 90% platinum and 10% metal called iridium
 is prakaar main metron ko aadharbhoot maanakon ke liye sabase santoshprad mana jaataa he
 In many works, where the problem of very accurate measurement arises, it is necessary that we treat such a material whose thermal expansion is nominal
 aisi dhaatuon kii khoj ho chuki he tathaa inamen se ek ko 'invaar' kehete hai
 It is a alloy of nickel and steel, which contains 36% nickel
 duusari mishradhatu ko stable invaar kii sangya di gai he
 It also contains little chromium
 is mishradhatu main saadhaaran invaar kii apeksha yathesht kam prasar hota he, to bhi isko achar ke rup main nahin mana ja saktaa
 The second material is fused silica, whose diffusion coefficient is very low
 yah dravya ek degree sein0 taap badhane par keval 0
4 ́10-6 badhata he
 The standard meter of fused silica is the shape of a tube, with parallel banding at the end
 iske platinikrut tal par simaankit rekhaayen khudi hoti he
 As far as this standard is known, there has been no change in its length
 chunki is prakaar kaa maanak bahut hi najuk hota he, isaliye na to ise moulik nirdesh maanak ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya or na iskaa prachlan dainik kaaryon main hua
 It is used only in metrology laboratories
 kisi bhi prakritik maanak dwaara abhi tak ikai sanhati kii paribhaasha dene kaa prayaas nahin kiya gaya
 It is known to all of us that in the search for radioactive substances it was previously considered an essential stable property of samhita or mass substance
 batkhron kii sanhati yaa dravya maanak main parivartan kii ashanka apgharshan, oxikaran tathaa ardratagrahi avasorana ke kaaran hi sambhav he
 If the standards of liquids are conserved and used with due care, they exhibit considerable load stability
 bhaar kaa aadharbhoot maanaknirdesh platinum tathaa iridium mishradhatu kaa bana he
 This alloy has been used in the manufacture of 'state standard pound' and 'international etc
 type kilogram'
 kai varshon ke baad jab kilogram kii vibhinn rashtriya pratiyon kii pun: tulana kii gai, to yah gyaat hua ki sthirataa kaa str 108 main ek bhaag tak he
 This reflects not only the accuracy of the standards but also the completeness of comparisons
 ek doosraa dravya, jisamen sanhati kii ucch str kii sthirataa pai jaati he, crystal quartz kehalaata he
 The errors in this are that its density is relatively low and it is absorbent
 hawa main sanhati ke maanakon kii tulana karte samay ye maanak vaayu ke vibhinn aaytanon ko hataate hai
 Therefore, consideration of upper buoyancy effect must be taken in comparing the standards of the code
 yadi maanak kaa ghanatv kam hoga, to utplavan sanshodhan zyada hoga
 The accuracy achieved in comparison to platinum-iridium standards is based on the fact that their density is not only very high but very close
 iske kaaran utplavan sanshodhan bahut hi kam hota he
 Buoyancy modification arises as a problem in comparison to weights whose density varies greatly, such as platinum, quartz, and brass, etc
 is dosha ko dur karne ke liye vayurahit vaataavaran main taulnaa aavashyak he
 In daily business activities, weighing is done in the air and the difference due to buoyancy in the weights and goods is negligible from the business point of view
 nireekshak vyapaarik baaton kii tulana ke liye pital ke, jiskaa ghanatv 8
143 he, baaton ke maanak kaam main laate hai
 Even when we do not weigh in an airless environment, the balance of the bent should be good, the method of application should be efficient and alert for proper comparison of the primary parameters of mass
 tula ke shunya pathnaank ko sthir rakhane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki tapasthirataa main atyant saavdhaanee barti jaay
 Therefore, the room in which the balance is kept, it is necessary to control the temperature in a structural manner and the inspector should do the weighing work from outside the room, or it should be weighed from some distance
 baaton ko kaam main laane kaa kaary tula ke baahar se yantric niyantran dwaara, yaa lambii chhadon se chalaakar, kiya janaa chahie
 The movement of the pedicle of the Libra must be viewed either through a telescope or at the scale of a light beam reflected from the pedestal across the scale
 taap kaa prabhaav tula par kam se kam ho, isaliye yah aavashyak he ki invaar kii tandi vyavhaar main laai jaay, kint invaar kuch had tak chumbakeey he
 If a very high degree of purity is required, it is necessary that the pedicle of the weft is completely disguised by magnetic effects and the weigher is placed in an iron box
 choti choti matraaon ko taulne ke liye or vishesh kar gaison ke ghantvon kii tulana main, sookshm tula prayog main laai jaati he, jo purnataya balit quartz kii bani hoti he
 Even 1 / 10 gram has been weighed up to the purity of one part in 108 by this type of weighing

 nitrogen yogikikaran us prakriya ko kehete hai he jiske dwaara prithvi ke vayumandal kii nitrogen, ammonium]] yaa or jeevon ke liye laabhadaayak anya anuon main parivartit kii jaati he 
 Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular nitrogen is a relatively inert substance that it does not readily react with other chemicals to form new compounds
 kintu yogeekaran kii prakriya se N≡N bandh se nitrogen parmaanu ko mukt kar detaa he or yah mukt nitrogen duusare tareekon se upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Nitrogen fixation is essential for vegetative and some other organisms because inorganic nitrogen is required for basic formation of organisms, and for biological synthesis
 Therefore, as part of the nitrogen cycle, it is necessary for agriculture and fertilizer manufacturing
 It is, indirectly, essential for the manufacture of all nitrogen-containing chemical compounds, including explosives, most medicines, and chemical dyes
 nitrogen yogikikaran sookshm jeevanu, jaise ezotobacter, dwaara mitti main prakritik rup se kiya jaataa he
 Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria coexist with certain plant groups, especially legumes
 nitrogen-phixing bacteria or paudhon ke bich kabhi kabhi sampoornat: sahjivit sambandh sambandh nahin hote he
 jaise kii chaaval kii jaden par nitrogen ke nirdhaaran main dekha jaataa he
 akashiya vidyut ke dwaara vaataavaran main nox ke utpaadan kii prakriya main bhi nitrogen yogikikaran kaa upyog hota he 
 All biological nitrogen fixation is done through a metalloenzyme called nitrogenase
 in anzimon main loha hota he, aksar ek duusari dhaatu ke saath, jo kii aamtaur par molibdenum hota he par kabhi-kabhi vanadium bhi
 Microorganisms that can determine nitrogen are prokaryotes known as diazotrophs
 kuch ucch shrenee ke paudhon, or kuch jeev, dyjotroph ke saath sahjivit sambandh kaa gathan kar sakate hai
 Aerial electricity can convert oxygen and nitrogen into nox in the atmosphere
 yah ek prakaar kii gaiyr jaivik prakritik nitrogen yogikikaran prakriya he
 nox pani ke saath pratikriya kar ke nitras acid yaa nitric acid ban saktaa he, or mitti main ris kar yah paudhon ke liye upjau nitrate ban jaataa he| Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered by German agronomist Hermann Hellerigel and Dutch microbiologist Martinus Biernik

 Dwivedi ji gave his statement on this occasion, it was published under the name 'atma-request'
 is ‘aatm-nivedan’ main ve kehete hai, ‘‘mujhe acharya kii padavin mili he
 Why met, is not known

 At the same time, he practiced Pingal, i

 unhone apni pehali pustak 1895 i

 Dwivedi ji has done all the gestures in a prolific quote in prose
 unhone isaki bhoomika main likhaa he, ‘‘is kaary main hushangabadasth babu harishchandr kulshreshth kaa jo samprat madhyapradesh rajdhani nagpur main virajman hai, main param kritagya hoon
 In his "self-request" he wrote, "since childhood, my Anurag fell on the Ramayana of Tulsidas and the Brajavilas of Brajavasidas

 What was it then, i started thinking of myself as a poet, not just a poet
 meraa yah rog bahut dinon tak jyon kaa tyon bana rahaa
 "from 1889 to 1892 AD, many such books of Dwivedi were published - vinay-vinod, vihar-vatika, Snehmala, Ritu Tarangini, Devi Stuti Centenary, Sri Gangalhari etc
 1896 i
 main inhone lord bekan ke nibandhon kaa hindi main bhavarth mulak rupantar kiya, jo bekan-vichaar-ratnavali pustak main sankalit hai
 In 1898, he wrote a critique of Hindi Kalidas, which is the first Hindi critical book
 1988 i

 This series which started, lasted till 1930-31 AD and Dwivedi's total eighty five books were published
 janvari, 1903 i
 se disambar, 1920 i
 tak inhone saraswati naamak masik patrika kaa sampadan kar ek kirtiman sthapit kiya tha, isiilie is kaal ko hindi saahityetihaas main ‘dvivedi-yug’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 He came to be called 'acharya' due to his ecclesiastical erudition
 unke vyaktitv ke bare main acharya kishori das vaajapeyi ne likhaa he, ‘‘unke sudrudh vishaal or bhavy kalevar ko dekhakar darshak par sahasaa aatank chaa jaataa tha or yah prathit hone lagata tha ki main ek mahaan gyanrashi ke neeche aa gaya hoon
 "dwivedi ji believed that literature is the name of the accumulated corpus of" knowledge-sign "
 ’ dvivedi ji swayan to ek ‘mahaan gyaan-raashi’ the hi unka sampurna vaanmay bhi sanchit gyanrashi he, jisase hokar guzaranaa apni jaateey parampara ko aatmsaat karte hue vishvachintan ke samaksh bhi hona he
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma has propounded the importance of Dwivedi ji, writing, "the first thing that Dwivedi did in the beginning of his literary life was that he studied economics
 unhone jo pustak badi mehnat se likhi or jo aakaar main unki or pustakon se badi he, vah sampattishastra he
 xxrep 5 
 Due to the study of economics, Dwivedi could write such comments on many subjects that exceed the limits of pure literature
 iske saath unhone raajnneeti vishyon kaa adhyayan kiya or sansar main jo mahatvapurn raajnneeti ghatnaayen ho rahi thim, un par unhone lekh likhe
 With politics and economics, he got acquainted with modern science and studied history and sociology in depth
 iske saath bharat ke pracheen darshan or vigyaan kii ore inhone dhyaan diya or yah jaanane kaa praytn kiya ki ham apane chintan main kahan aage bade hue hai or kahan pichde hai
 No such editor had prepared them before
 parinaam yah hua ki hindi pravesh main naveen saamaajik chetana ke prasar ke liye vah sabase upyukt vyakti siddh hue
 '' aise mahaan gyaan-raashi ke punj the acharya mahavir prasad dvivedi
 But all the critics of Ramvilas Sharma, who were earlier critics, not only evaluated Dwivedi ji, but also devalued him
 in mahaan aalochakon main ramachandra shukla, nandadulaare vaajapeyi evam hajaari prasad dvivedi pramukh hai
 Take a look at the comment made by Ramchandra Shukla on Dwivedi ji in the history of Hindi literature, "dwivedi took the burden of editing Saraswati in 1903 AD
 tab se apana sara samay likhane main hi lagaaya
 He believed in the success of writing that readers should understand a lot from him
 kai upyogi pustakon ke atirikt unhone footkar lekh bhi bahut likhe
 But most of the articles in these articles are in the form of 'collection of things'
 bhashaa ke nutan shakti chamatkaar ke saath nae-nae vichaaron kii udbhaavna vaale niabandh bahut hi kam milte hai
 In the category of permanent essays, only four articles, such as 'poet and poetry', 'genius', etc
 can be included
 par ye lekhankaal yaa sookshm vichaar kii drushti se likhe nahin jaan padate
 Needless to say what a serious subject 'poet and Poetry' is
 par is vishay kii bahut moti-moti baaten bahut mote taur par kahi gai hai
 "in the same context, Ramchandra Shukla writes further," It is needless to say that Dwijji ji's articles or essays will fall under the ideological category
 par vichaar kii vah gudh gunfit parampara unamem nahin milti jisase pathak kii buddhi uttejit hokar kisi nai vichaar-paddati par daud pade
 The ultimate climax of pure reflective essays can be said to be the one where the ideas in a paragraph are tightly pressed and each sentence is for an associated clause
 dvivedi ji ke lekhon ko padhane main aisa jaan padataa he ki lekhak bahut moti akl ke pathakon ke liye likh rahaa he
 '' ab aap dekhen ki mahavir prasad dvivedi ke lekhan ke prati ramchandra shukla kii ye tippanee padhakar hindi kaa koi bhi pathak usase virakt hoga yaa aasakt
 For sixty-sixty-five years, students of Hindi have been remembering the history of Ramachandra Shukla like emergency words
 aise main mul paath se unke aapt vaakyon kaa yadi milan kar pareekshan na kiya jaae, to anarth hoga hi
 Ramchandra Shukla is the biggest critic of Hindi, the biggest literary historian
 isi itihaas main ve mahavir prasad dvivedi ke aitihaasik yogadanon ko sirf bhashaa-parishkarkartta ke rup main sweekaar karte hai
 His words are, "although Dwivedi did not present a permanent literature review of serious literature about the great poets of Hindi, but by criticizing the language of the newly released books, he has done a huge favor of Hindi literature
 yadi dvivedi ji na uth khadey hote to jaisaa avyavasthit, vyakaranviruddh or ootpataang bhashaa chaaron ore dikhaai padati thi, uski parampara jaldi na rukati
 The writer became cautious of his influence and improved his understanding and ability of the language
 ’’ darasal shukla ji jis aalochana-paddati kaa sahaara lekar ukt baaten likh rahe the, use angreji main Judicial Criticism or hindi main nirnayaatmak aalochana kehete hai or iskaa sabase bada dosha yah he ki iske aalochana ke kshetra main aalochakon kaa dhyaan aitihaasik yug, vaataavaran evam jivan se hataakar adhikanshat: kalapaksh tak hi simit kar diya he
 Critics who have paid attention to the art form say that the epoch circumstances, the ego consciousness and the epoch truth are constantly changing, hence they cannot be made the basis
 unki parivartanshiltaa ke kaaran inhen sahitya kaa sthaayee maandand sweekaar kiya ja saktaa
 But at the same time it is also true that in such a situation, judicial criticism will have no value
 iskaa mukhya kaaran he aise aalochak kaa rachanaakaar or rachana par fatve jari karnaa
 This is the reason why Ramchandra Shukla did not pay attention to Dwivedi ji's thoughts, his accumulated wisdom and his language
 ‘moti-moti baaten bahut mote taur par’-yah abhivyakti kii pranali par baat kii ja rahi he, jo nihsandeh bhashaa he
 When Dwivedi ji used to write for the foolish or obese people and wrote in a thick way, how did he refine the language? How will the writer who has a superficial understanding of the language correct the language of other writers? Consider again the words of Ramchandra Shukla - Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi did not write eternal literature or permanent literature
 unka mahatva bhashaa-sudhaar main he or unki bhashaa kisi he-moti aqlawaalon ke liye he
 Acharya Shukla's history is full of such things
 mahavir prasad dvivedi ne hindi-navratna kii samiksha likhte hue likhaa he, ‘‘is tarah kii baaten kisi itihaas car ke granth main yadi pai jaaen to uske itihaas kaa mahatv kam hue bina nahin rah saktaa
 The language of the historian should be balanced
 use betuki baaten na haankani chahie
 Writing exaggerations is not the work of a historian
 use chahie ki vah prayek shabd or vaakyansh ke arth ko acchhee tarah samajhakar uskaa prayog kare
 '' san 1933 i
 main acharya dvivedi ko nagari prachaarini sabha dwaara abhinandan granth bhent kiya gaya
 Its preface was published in the name of Shyamsunder Das and Rayakrishnadas, but it was written by Nandadulare Vajpayee
 isliye yah 1940 i
 main prakashit vaajapeyi ji kii pustak hindi sahitya: beesvin shatabdi main sankalit he
 It envisages whether Dwivedi ji's literature may be enumerated in permanent or eternal literature

 Only the editions of Saraswati edited by him were given importance
 ; Premchand is one of the greatest Indian writers in Hindi and Urdu
 mul naam dhanpat raay shrivastav, premchand ko nawab raay or munshi premchand ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Seeing his contribution in the field of novels, the famous novelist of Bengal, Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, addressed him as novel Samrat
 premchand ne hindi kahani or upanyaas kii ek aisi parampara kaa vikaas kiya jisane puri sadi ke sahitya kaa maargdarshan kiya
 Premchand laid the foundation of the realistic tradition of literature by deeply influencing an entire generation

 He was a sensitive writer, vigilant citizen, skilled speaker and sudhi editor

 After Premchand, the people who worked to advance literature with social concerns and progressive values include from Yashpal to Muktibodh
 premchand kaa janm 31 july 1880 ko varanasi ke nikat lamahi gaanv main hua tha
 His mother's name was Anandi Devi and father Munshi Ajayabarya was a postman in Lamhi
 unki shiksha kaa aarambh urdu, farsi se hua or jeevanyaapan kaa adhyaapan se padhane kaa shauk unhen bachapan se hi lag gaya
 At the age of 13, he read tilism-e-hoshruba and got acquainted with the novels of famous Urdu writers Ratananath 'sharasar', Mirza Hadi Ruswa and Maulana Sharr
 1898 main metric kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad ve ek sthaneey vidhyalay main shikshak niyukt ho gaye
 He continued with his job
 1910 main unhone angreji, darshan, farsi or itihaas lekar inter paas kiya or 1919 main bi
e
 paas karne ke baad shiksha vibhaag ke inspector pad par niyukt hue
 His early life was a struggle because his mother died at the age of seven and his father died at the age of fourteen
