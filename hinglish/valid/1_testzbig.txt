"rupaya" shabd kaa udgam sanskrit ke shabd rup yaa rupyah me nihit he, jiskaa arth kachi chaandi hota he or roopyakam kaa arth chaandi kaa sikaa he
 The term "rupee" was first used by Sher Shah Suri during his brief reign in India
 sher shah suri ne apane shashan kaal me jo rupaya chalaaya vah ek chaandi kaa sikaa tha jiskaa vajan 178 grain ke lagbhag tha
 He also operated a copper coin called a price and a gold coin called a mohar

 karn mahabharat ke sabase pramukh paatro main se ek he
 Karna is considered the great hero of Mahabharata
 karn mahabharat ke sarvshereshth dharnudhari the 
 Lord Krishna and Lord Parashurama themselves acknowledged the superiority of Karni
 karn kii vaastavik maan kunti thi
 Karna was born before Kunti married Pandu
 karn duryodhana kaa sabase acha mitra tha or mahabharat ke yuddh main vah apane bhaaiyon ke viruddh ladaa
 He was the son of Surya
 karn ko ek adarsh daanveer mana jaataa he kyonki karn ne kabhi bhi kisi maangane vaale ko daan main kuch bhi dene se kabhi bhi manaa nahin kiya bhale hi iske parinamswaroop uske apane hi praan sankat main kyon na pad gaye hon
 Karna's image even today is that of a mahayodha in the Indian public who fought against adverse conditions throughout his life
 bahut se logon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki karn ko kabhi bhi vah sab nahin mila jiskaa vah vaastavik rup se adhikari tha
 Logically speaking, Karna was the real officer in the throne of Hastinapur as he belonged to the Kuru royal family and was eldest to Yudhishthira and Duryodhana, but his true identity remained unknown until his death
 karn ko ek daanveer or mahaan yoddha mana jaataa he
 Karna was born as a boon to Kunti
 jab vah kunari thi, tab ek baar durvasa rishi uske pita ke mahal main padhaare
 Then Kunti served the sage very well for a whole year
 kunti ke sevabhaav se prasann hokar unhonen apni divyadrushti se ye dekh liya ki pandu se use santaan nahin ho sakati or use ye vardaan diya ki vah kisi bhi devtaa kaa samaran karke unase santaan utpann kar sakati he
 One day anxiously, Kunti meditated on Sun God
 isse surya dev prakat hue or use ek putr diya jo tej main surya ke hi samaan tha or vah kavach or kundal lekar utpann hua tha jo janm se hi uske sharir se chipke hue the
 Since she was still unmarried, she put her son in a box and washed it in Gangaji for fear of public harm
 is As Karna was drifting in Gangaji, Maharaj Dhritarashtra's charioteer Adhirath and his wife Radha saw him and adopted him and began to follow him
 unhone use vasusen naam diya
 Karna is also known as Radheya in the name of his upbringing mother
 apane janm ke rahasyodghatan hone or ang kaa raja banaae jane ke pashchaat bhi karn ne sadaiv unheen ko apana mata-pita mana or apni mrityu tak sabhi putr dharmon nibhaayaa
 After being made the king of Anga, Karna also got a name Angaraja
 kumaar awastha se hi karn kii ruchi apane pita adhirath ke samaan rath chalaane ki bajaay yudhkala main adhik thi
 Karna and his father Adhirath Acharya met Drona, who was one of the best masters of martial arts at that time
 dronacharya us samay kuru rajkumaron ko shiksha diya karte the
 He refused to teach Karna as Karna was a charioteer and Drona only taught Kshatriyas
 dronacharya kii asammati ke uparant karn ne parashuram se sampark kiya jo ki keval brahmanon ko hi shiksha diya karte the
 Karna, calling himself a Brahmin, urged Parasurama for education
 parashuram ne karn kaa aagrah sweekaar kiya or karn ko apane samaan hi yudhkala or dhanurvidya main nishnaat kiya
 In this way Karna became a very hard working and accomplished disciple of Parashurama
 karn ko uske guru parashuram or prithvi mata se shraap mila tha
 Apart from this, Karna received many curses
 karn kii shiksha apane antim charan par thi
 One afternoon, Guru Parshuram was resting on Karna's thigh
 kuch der baad kahin se ek bichchhu aayaa or uski duusari jangha par kaat kar ghaav banane laga
 Karna used to bear the sting by not removing the scorpion so that the rest of the Guru is not disturbed
 kuch der main guruji kii nidra tuuti or unhonen dekha kii karn kii jaangh se bahut rakt bah rahaa he
 He said that only a Kshatriya could have such tolerance to bear a scorpion sting, not in a Brahmin and Parshuramji cursed him due to a false speech that whenever Karna would need his education most, That day it will not work for him
 karn, jo ki swayan yah nahin jaanata tha ki vah kis vansh se he, ne apane guru se kshamaa maangi or kaha ki uske sthaan par yadi koi or shishy bhi hota to wo bhi yahi karata
 Although Karna was enraged at cursing him with anger, he could not take back his curse
 tab unhonen karn ko apana vijay naamak dhanush pradaan kiya or use ye aashirwad diya ki use vah vastu milegi jise vah sarvaadhik chahta he - amit prasiddhi
 It is believed in some folklore to be Indra himself as a scorpion, who wanted to reveal his true Kshatriya identity
 parashuramji ke ashram se jane ke pashchaat, karn kuch samay tak bhatakta rahaa
 During this time he was learning vocabulary
 abhyaas ke dauraan usne ek gaay ke bachade ko koi vaneey pashu samaj liya or us par shabdabhedi baan chalaa diya or bachhda maaraa gaya
 Then the Brahmin, the lord of the cow, cursed Karna that just as he killed a helpless animal, one day he would also be killed when he would be most helpless and when all his attention was focused on something other than his enemy
 Will happen
 andhra kii lok kathaon ke anusaar ek baar karn kahin ja rahaa tha, tab raste main use ek kanya mili jo apane ghade se ghi ke bikhar jane ke kaaran ro rahi thi
 When Karna wanted to know the reason for his anxiety, he told that he feared that his stepmother would be angry at his inattentiveness
 krupaalu karn ne tab usase kaha ki bah use nayaa ghi laakar degaa
 Then the girl requested that she should have the same ghee mixed in the soil and she refused to take new ghee
 tab kanya par dayaa karte hue karn ne ghi yukt mitti ko apni muththi main liya or nichodne laga taaki mitti se ghi nichudakar ghade main gir jaae
 During this process, he heard the painful sound of a woman with his hand
 jab usne apni muththi kholi to dharti mata ko paaya
 Enraged by the pain, Dharti Mata criticized Karna and said that she gave so much pain to the ghee of a girl
 or tab dharti mata ne karn ko shraap diya ki ek din uske jivan ke kisi nirnaayak yuddh main vah bhi uske rath ke pahie ko vaise hi pakad lengi jaise usne unhen apni muththi main pakadaa he, jisase vah us yuddh main apane shatru ke saamne asurakshit ho jayega
 Thus, Karna received three curses on three separate occasions
 durbhaagya se ye teenon hi shraap kurukshetra ke nirnaayak yuddh main faleebhoot hue, jab vah yuddh main astr viheen, rath viheen or asahaay ho gaya tha
 This is how the various curses Karna got impacted
 yadi ek brahmastra bhi shatru ke khemen par choda jaae to naa keval vah us kheme ko nasht karata he balki us puure kshetra main 12 se bhi adhik varshon tak akaal padataa he
 And if two brahmastras are collided, then it is as if the catastrophe happens
 isse samast prithvi kaa vinaash ho jayega or is prakaar ek anya bhumandal or samast jeevadhariyon kii rachana kerani padegi
 The situation of two Brahmastras colliding in the war of Mahabharata came when Ashwatthama and Arjuna drove their Brahmastras in the ashram of sage Vedavyasji
 tab vedavyasji ne us takaraav ko taala or apane-apane brahmastron ko lautaa lene ko kaha
 Arjuna knew how to return Brahmastra, but Ashwatthama did not know this and then due to that Brahmastra, Parikshit was born dead from Uttara's womb
 lekin karn guru parashuram ke shraap ke kaaran brahmastra chalaanaa bhul gaya tha, nahin to vah yuddh main arjuna kaa vadh karne ke liye avashya hi apana brahmastra chalaata or arjuna bhi apane bachaav ke liye apana brahmastra chalaata or puri prithvi kaa vinaash ho jaataa
 Thus Guru Parshuram averted the destruction of Earth by cursing Karna
 dharti mata kaa shraap yah tha ki karn ke jivan ke sabase nirnaayak yuddh main dharti uske rath ke pahiye ko pakad lengi
 In the battle of that day, Karna used different chariots, but each time the wheel of his chariot got smashed into the earth
 isliye vibhinn rathon kaa prayog karke bhi karn dharti mata ke shraap se nahin batch saktaa tha, anyathaa vah us nirnaayak yuddh main arjuna par baari padataa
 Guru Dronacharya organized a rangbhoomi in Hastinapur on completion of the education of his disciples
 rangabhumi main arjuna vishesh dhanurvidya yukt shishy pramanit hua
 Then Karna came to Rangbhoomi and crossed the tricks done by Arjuna and challenged him to a duel
 kab kripacharya ne karn ke dvandvayuddh ko asweekrut kar diya or usase uske vansh or samrajya ke vishay main poocha - kyonki dvandvayuddh ke niyamon ke anusaar keval ek rajkumaar hi arjuna ko, jo hastinapur kaa rajkumaar tha, dvandvayuddh ke liye lalkaar saktaa tha
 Then Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, declared Karna as the king of Angadesh so that he would be eligible for a duel with Arjuna
 jab karn ne duryodhana se poocha ki vah usase iske badale main kya chahta he, tab duryodhana ne kaha ki vah keval ye chahta he ki karn uskaa mitra ban jaae
 After this incident, some of the main relations of the Mahabharata were established, such as strong ties between Duryodhana and Karna, intense rivalry between Karna and Arjuna and disharmony between the Pandavas and Karna
 karn, duryodhana kaa ek nishthavan or sachcha mitra tha
 Although he later participates in Dutikrida to appease Duryodhana, he was against it from the beginning
 karn shakuni ko pasand nahin karata tha or sadaiv duryodhana ko yahi paramarsh detaa ki vah apane shatruon ko parrast karne ke liye apane yuddh kaushal or baahubal kaa prayog kare naa ki kutil chaalon kaa
 When the attempt to kill the Pandavas in the Lakshgriha fails, Karna scolds Duryodhana for his cowardice and says that all the tricks of the cowardly fail and convince him that he should act like a warrior and he Whatever you want to achieve, get it through your bravery
 chitrangad kii rajkumaari se vivaah karne main bhi karn ne duryodhana kii sahaayta kii thi
 In his swayamvara he rejected Duryodhana and then Duryodhana took him by force
 tab vahaan upasthit anya raajaaon ne uskaa peechha kiya, lekin karn ne akele hi un sabko parrast kar diya
 The defeated kings were Jarasandha, Shishupala, Dantavakra, Salva and Rukmi etc
 karn kii prashansa swaroop, jarasandh ne karn ko magadh kaa ek bhaag de diya
 Bhima later defeated Jarasandha with the help of Sri Krishna but long before that Karna defeated him alone
 karn hi ne jarasandh kii is durbalata ko ujagar kiya tha ki uski mrityu keval uske dhad ko pairon se cheer kar do tukdo main baant kar ho sakati he
 After becoming Angraj, Karna announced that during the day when he worships Suryadev, if anyone asks for anything at that time, he will not refuse and the one who asks will never return empty handed
 karn kii isi daanveerta kaa mahabharat ke yuddh main indra or mata kunti ne laabh uthaaya
 In the midst of the war of Mahabharata, one day before Karna became the commander, Indra asked Karna in the guise of a monk for his armor-coil, because if this armor-coil remained near Karna, it was impossible to defeat him in battle
 And keeping in mind the safety of his son Arjuna, Indra demanded so much begging from Karna, but Danveer Karna did not even refuse Devraj Indra in monk's disguise and these Promised to take the boon demanded by some centers is against the dignity of donations to some demand after giving that "saying these Indra" not asked for anything
 isi prakaar mata kunti ko bhi daanveer karn dwaara yah vachan diya gaya ki is mahayuddh main unke paanch putr avashya jivit rahenge or vah arjuna ke atirikt or kisi pandav kaa vadh nahin karegaa
 And he did the same, Karna had also sought Indrastra from Devraj Indra for the slaughter of Arjuna
 karn, draupadi ke swayamvar main ek vivaah-prastaavak tha
 Unlike other rivals, Karna was able to bend the bow and propel it, but as soon as he was ready to hit the target, then at the behest of Shri Krishna, Draupadi stopped Karna from doing so by uttering a sutra
 
 pandav bhi vahaan brahman ke bhesh main upasthit the
 When other princes and kings failed, Arjuna stepped forward and successfully penetrated the eye of the fish and won Draupadi's hand
 jab baad main arjuna kii pahchaan ujagar hui to karn kii pratidwandvita kii bhaavana or gahari ho gai
 Karna never agreed with Shakuni's plans to defeat the Pandavas with deceit
 vah sadaa hi yuddh ke paksh main tha or sadaiv hi duryodhana se yuddh kaa hi maarg chunane kaa aagrah karata
 Although he indulged in the game of Dutikrida to appease Duryodhana, who later flourished in the infamous Draupadi rip-off incident
 jab shakuni chhal-kapat dwaara dyutakrida main yudhisthir se sab kuch jeet gaya, to pandavon kii pataraani draupadi ko duhshasan dwaara ghaseet kar rajsabha main laayaa gaya or karn ke uksaane par, duryodhana or uske bhaiyon ne draupadi ke vastra haran kaa prayaas kiya
 Karna insults Draupadi by saying that a woman who has more than one husband is nothing but a prostitute
 usee sthaan par, bhim dwaara yah pratigya lee jaati he ki vah akele hi yuddh main duryodhana or uske sabhi bhaiyon kaa vadh karegaa
 And then Arjuna vows to kill Karna
 pandavon ke vanvaas ke dauraan, karn, duryodhana ko prithvi kaa samraat banane kaa kaary apane haathon main letaa he
 Karna waged military campaigns all over the country and defeated the kings and promised them that he would remain loyal to Hastinapur Maharaj Duryodhana, otherwise he would be killed in wars
 karn sabhi ladaayeeyon main safal rahaa
 In the Mahabharata, Karna, in his military campaigns, waged many wars and forced numerous kingdoms and empires to obey, including Kamboj, Shaka, Kekya, Avantay, Gandhar, Madra, Trigat, Tangan, Panchal, Videha
 , Suhmas, Anga, Wang, Nishad, Kalinga, Vatsa, Ashmak, Hrishik and many others which also have mlechha and forest dwellers
 duryodhana ke saath shaanti vaarta ke vifal hone ke pashchaat, shrikrishna, karn ke paas jate hai, jo duryodhana kaa sarvshereshth yoddha he
 He tells him the real introduction of Karna, that he is the eldest Pandava and advises him to come towards the Pandavas
 krishna use yah vishwaas dilaate hai ki chunki vah sabase jyeshtha pandav he, isliye yudhisthir uske liye rajsinghaasana chhod denge or vah ek chakravati samraat banegaa
 But even after all this, Karna refuses to fight in the Pandava side, because he considered himself a debtor to Duryodhana and promised him that he would fight in favor of Duryodhana till his death
 vah krishna ko yah bhi kahata he ki jab tak ve pandavon ke paksh main hai jo ki satya ke paksh main hai, tab tak uski haar bhi nishchit he
 Krishna then becomes somewhat sad, but praises Karna's loyalty and friendship and accepts his decision and promises him that he will keep his true identity a secret until his death
 arjuna ke pita or devraj indra ko is baat kaa gyaan hota he ki karn yudhakshetra main tab tak aparaajey or amar rahegaa jab tak uske paas uske kavach or kundal rahenge, jo janm se hi uske sharir par the
 So when the battle of Kurukshetra was imminent, Indra decided that he would not allow Karna to enter the battlefield with armor and Kundal
 unhonen ye yojana banaai kii vah madhyahn main jab karn surya dev kii puja kar rahaa hota he tab vah ek bhikshuk banakar usase uske kavach-kundal maang lengen
 Suryadev also warns Karna about this plan of Indra, but he thanks him and says that if anyone asks for his life at that time, he will not refuse
 tab suryadev kehete he ki yadi vah swavachanabaddh he, to vah indra se unka amoghastra maang le
 Then, according to his plan, Lord Indra, disguised as a beggar, asks Karna for his armor and helmet
 chetaye jane ke baad bhi karn manaa nahin karata or harshpurvak apana kavach-kundal daan kar detaa he
 Pleased with this charity of Karna, he asks her to ask for something, but Karna refuses, saying "it is against the dignity of charity" to ask for something after donating
 tab indra use apana shaktishaalee astr vaasavi pradaan karte he jiskaa prayog vah keval ek baar hi kar saktaa tha
 After this, Karna got another name as Vaikartan, because he cut his armor and hair from his body without being compressed and donated it
 jab mahabharat kaa yuddh nikat tha, tab mata kunti, karn se bhent karne gai or use uski vaastavik pahchaan kaa gyaan karaayaa
 She tells him that he is their son and the eldest Pandava
 vah usase kahati hai ki vah swayan ko 'kaunteya' kahe naaki 'radhey' or tab karn uttar detaa he ki vah chahta he ki sara sansaar use radhey ke naam se jane naaki kaunteya ke naam se
 Kunti tells him that he should turn to the Pandavas and he will make him king
 tab karn kahata he ki bahut varsh purv us rangabhumi main yadi unhonen use kaunteya kaha hota to aaj sthiti bahut bhinn hoti
 But now it is too late for any change and now it is not possible
 vah aage kahata he ki duryodhana uskaa mitra he or us par bahut vishwaas karata he or vah uske vishwaas ko dhokhaa nahin de saktaa
 But he promises to Kunti that he will not kill any other Pandava except Arjuna
 karn or arjuna donon ne hi ek duusare kaa vadh karne kaa pran liya hota he or isliye donon main se kisi ek kii mrityu to nishchit he
 He says that none of his five sons will survive - four other Pandavas and one of them or Arjuna
 karn apni mata se nivedan karata he ki vah unke sambandh or uske janm kii baat ko uski mrityu tak rahasy rakhe
 Kunti asks Karna for another promise to use Nagastra only once
 karn yah vachan bhi kunti ko detaa he
 As a result, Karna is unable to use Nagastra more than once in the later battle of Kurukshetra
 mahabharat kaa yuddh armbh hone se purv, bhishma ne, jo kaurav sena ke pradhan senapati the, karn ko apane netritv main yudhakshetra main bhagidaari karne se manaa kar diya
 Although Duryodhana pleads with them, they do not believe
 or phir karn dasven din unke ghayal hone ke pashchaat gyarahawein din hi yubhumi main aa paata he
 In the thirteenth day of war, Chakravyuh / Padmavieh was created by Guru Dronacharya, the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army, to imprison Yudhishthira
 pandav paksh main keval krishna or arjuna hi chakravyuuh bhedan jaanate the
 But on that day, the tri-monarch-brothers took him far away from the site of Chakravyuh while fighting
 trigat, duryodhana ke shasnadhin ek rajya tha
 Arjuna-son Abhimanyu knew only to enter the Chakravyuh, not to leave it, which he had heard when he was in his mother's womb and his father Arjuna was explaining this method to his mother and in the middle he got sleepy 
 lekin jaise hi abhimanyu ne chakravyuuh main pravesh kiya, sindhu naresh - jaydrath ne pravesh maarg roak liya or anya pandavon ko bheetar pravesh nahin karne diya
 Then Abhimanyu fell alone in the enemy cycle
 akelaa hone par bhi vah veerta se ladaa or usne akele hi kaurav sena ke bade-bade yoddhaon ko parrast kiya
 Karna and Duryodhana decided to kill Abhimanyu as instructed by Guru Drona
 karn ne baan chalaakar abhimanyu kaa dhanush or rath kaa ek pahiyaa tod diya jisase vah bhoomi par gir padaa or anya kauravon ne usapar akraman kar diya
 Abhimanyu was killed in this war
 yuddh samaapti par jab arjuna ko ye pataa lagata he ki abhimanyu ke maare jane main jaydrath kaa sabase bada haath he to vah pratigya letaa he ki agle din kaa suryaast hone se purv vah jaydrath kaa vadh kar degaa anyathaa agni samadhi le legaa
 The war on the fourteenth continued uninterruptedly after sunset and Bhimputra Ghatotkacha, a semi-demon, massacred the Kaurava armies
 aamtaur par, asur ratri ke samay bahut adhik shaktishaalee ho jate hai
 Duryodhana and Karna bravely confront him and fight him
 antatah jab yah lagane laga ki usee raat ghatotkach sari kaurav sena kaa sanhaar kar degaa to, duryodhana ne karn se ye nivedan kiya ki vah kisi bhi prakaar se is samasya se chhutkaaraa dilaae
 Karna was forced to run on Shakti weapon Ghatotkacha
 yah astr devraj indra dwaara karn ko uski daanaparayanta ke sammaan swaroop diya gaya tha 
 But Karna could use this weapon only once, after which this weapon would be returned to Indra
 is prakaar, shakti astr kaa prayog ghatotkach par karne ke baad vah ise baad main arjuna par naa kar sakaa
 On this day, the battle of Karnaka was fought
 bhimne karnako mallayudhki chunauti di parantu bhimki durdasha hui 
 Karna dragged Bhima to the ground and took away all of Bhim's clothes
 tab karnane bhimko jivandaan diya
 Then when faced with Arjuna, Lord Krishna saves Arjuna from the Vaishnavastra of Karna
 karnane apane tirose arjunako bandi bana liya parantu suryastke kaaran jivandaan diya 
 Before the seventeenth day, Karna fought with all the Pandavas except Arjuna
 usne mahabali bhim sahit in pandavon ko ek-par-ek ran main parrast bhi kiya tha
 But as promised to Mother Kunti, she did not kill any Pandavas
 karn ne apana vijay dhanush uthaaya or arjuna par bhargavaastra chalaa diya 
 Millions of warriors were killed by Bhargavastra and went to Arjuna to protect the rest
 arjuna ne kaha bhargavaastra ko nirast karnaa asambhav he or agar karn usko bhaagane degaa to wo yuddh se bhaag jaayegaa 
 Krishna saw the frightened Arjuna and thought that when Karna would get tired, it would be okay to bring Arjun in front of him
 itnaa sochakar krishna ne arjuna ke liye palaayan kaa maarg banaaya 
 Karna withdrew Bhargavastra seeing Arjuna running away after saving his life
 satrahawein din ke yuddh main aakhirkaar vah ghadi aa hi gai, jab karn or arjuna aamane-saamne aa gaye
 Both were equal in this magnificent struggle
 karn ko uske guru parashuram dwaara vijay naamak dhanush bhent swaroop diya gaya tha, jiskaa praturup swayan vishwakarma ne banaaya tha
 On the request of Duryodhana, the maternal uncle of the Pandavas agreed to become the charioteer of Karni
 darasal arjuna ke sarathi swayan shrikrishna the or karn kisi bhi maamle main arjuna se kam naa ho iske liye shalya se sarathi banane kaa nivedan kiya gaya, kyonki unke andar ve sabhi gun the jo ek yogya sarathi main hone chahie
 During the battle, Arjuna's arrows hit Karna's chariot and his chariot slips back several yards
 lekin, jab karn ke baan arjuna ke rath par lage to uskaa rath keval kuch hi baalist dur khiskaa
 On this, Shri Krishna praised Karna
 is baat par chakit hokar arjuna ne karn kii is prashansa kaa kaaran poocha, kyonki uske baan rath ko peeche khiskaane main adhik prabhaavshaalee the
 Then Krishna said that Karna's chariot has only the weight of Karna and Surgical, but Arjuna's chariot himself and Hanuman are seated and even then Karna pushed his chariot back a few times
 isi prakaar karn ne 13 baar arjuna ke dhanush kii pratyancha kaat di
 Karna and Arjuna fought a long and fierce battle, making full use of their knowledge of wielding divine weapons
 karn dwaara arjuna kaa sir dhad se alag karne ke liye "nagastra" kaa prayog kiya gaya
 But at the right time, the chariot was sunk a little in the ground by Shri Krishna, which saved Arjuna
 isse "nagastra" arjuna ke sir ke thik upar se uske mukut ko chhedta hua nikal gaya
 The Ashwena Naga present on Nagastra requested Karna to use the weapon again so that this time he would come out piercing Arjuna's body, but Karna obeyed the promise given to Kunti, refusing to reuse the weapon
 gives
 yadhyapi yuddh gatirodhpurna ho rahaa tha lekin karn tab ulajh gaya jab uske rath kaa ek pahiyaa dharti main dhans gaya 
 He also finds himself unable to use divine weapons, as was the curse of his mentor Parashurama
 tab karn apane rath ke pahie ko nikaalane ke liye neeche utarataa he or arjuna se nivedan karata he ki vah yuddh ke niyamon kaa paalan karte hue kuch der ke liye usapar baan chalaanaa band kar de
 Sri Krishna then tells Arjuna that Karna has no right to talk about war rules and religion, whereas he himself did not follow any war rules and religion at the time of Abhimanyu slaughter
 unhone aage kaha ki tab uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha jab usne divya-janma draupadi ko puri kuru rajsabha ke samaksh vaishya kaha tha
 Where did his religion go in the sports hall? isliye ab use koi adhikaar nahin kii vah kisi dharm yaa yuddh niyam kii baat kare or unhone arjuna se kaha ki abhi karn asahaay he isliye vah uskaa vadh kare
 Sri Krishna says that if Arjuna has not yet killed Karna at this critical turn, then the Pandavas will probably never be able to kill him and this war will never be won
 tab, arjuna ne ek divine astr kaa upyog karte hue karn kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 After Karna's body fell to the ground, a flame emerged from Karna's body and was absorbed into the sun
 yuddh samaapti ke pashchaat, mritak logon ke liye antyeshti sanskaar kiye ja rahe the
 Then Mother Kunti requested her sons to perform all the deceased rituals for Karna as well
 jab unhone yah kahkar iskaa virodh kiya kii karn ek sood putr he, tab kunti ne karn ke janm kaa rahasy kholaa
 Then all the Pandava brothers are shocked due to the sin of fratricide
 yudhisthir vishesh rup se apni mata par rusht hote hai or unhen or samast nari jaati ko ye shraap dete hai ki us samay ke baad se striyaan kisi bhi bhed ko chupa nahin paaengi
 Both Yudhishthira and Duryodhana wanted to perform the last rites of Karna
 yudhisthir kaa daawa yah tha kii chunki ve karn ke kanisht bhrata hai isliye yah adhikaar unka he
 Duryodhana's claim was that Yudhishthira and the other Pandavas never dealt with Karna fraternally, so now there is no justification for asserting this authority at this time
 tab shrikrishna madhyasthata karaten he or yudhisthir ko yah samajhaate hai ki duryodhana kii mitrataa kaa bandhan adhik sudrudh he isliye duryodhana ko karn kaa antim sanskaar karne diya jaae
 When the 18-day war ends, Shri Krishna asks Arjuna to step down from his chariot
 jab arjuna utar jaataa he to ve use kuch duuri par le jate hai
 Then they signal Hanumanji to come off the chariot flag
 jaise hi shri hanuman us rath se utarate hai, arjuna ke rath ke ashv jivit hi bhasma ho jate hai or rath main visphot ho jaataa he
 Arjun wakes up on seeing this
 tab shrikrishna use bataate hai ki karn ke ghaatak astron ke kaaran arjuna ke rath main yah visphot hua he
 It was safe till now because he was favored by him and had the power of Shree Hanuman, the chariot still bearing the effects of these destructive weapons
 aaj bhi lakhon hinduon ke liye karn ek aisa yoddha he jo jivan bhar dukhad jivan jeeta rahaa
 He is considered a great warrior, a great man with a courageous spirit, who struggled with the unfavorable conditions of his life
 vishesh rup se karn apni daanpriyata ke liye prasiddh he
 He is also an example of how improper decisions are of no use, despite a person's superior personality and best qualities
 karn ko kabhi bhi vah nahin mila jiskaa vah adhikari tha, par usne kabhi bhi prayaas karnaa nahin choda
 The contemporaries of Karna including Bhishma and Lord Krishna have accepted that Karna is a saint who manifests very rarely in the human race
 vah sangharshrat maanavtaa ke liye ek adarsh he ki maanav jati kabhi bhi haar naa maane or prayasarat rahe
 Karna and Arjuna have many similarities
 donon hi apane samay ke sarvshereshth dhanurdhar the, donon ne hi draupadi kaa haath jeetne ke liye pratiyogita main bhagidaari kii or donon ko apane bhaiyon ke viruddh yuddh main ladanaa padaa
 Another deep connection is that both were closely related to the Kauravas, Karna Mitravaat and Arjuna Rakrat
 unke nirnay or tadnurup iske un par or unke parivaaon par padane vaale parinaamon par is baat ke liye bal diya jaataa he ki apane kartavyon kaa paalan karne kaa kya mahatv he, jaisaa kii bhagavad gita main bhagwaan krishna dwaara bataaya gaya he
 Karna is an example of a personality who was virtuous, noble, just and courageous, but still declined because he was loyal to the unrighteous Duryodhana
 karn main ve paancho gun the jo draupadi ne apane var ke rup main mahadev se maange the, keval ek ko chhodkar or vah tha duryodhana se ghanishtha mitrataa
 Arjuna and Karna had both similarities and dissimilarities
 arjuna ko armbh se hi sukh, sampati or matruprem mil jabaaki karn ko har vastu praapt kerani padi
 Arjuna had everything that would make him victorious but Karna was completely alone
 apni sachai ke kaaran hi use saare abhishaap mili jise usne natmastak ho kar sweekaar kiya
 According to an analysis, during the war between Karna and Arjuna, there came an occasion when Arjun with such a force fired an arrow which directly hit Karna's chariot and his chariot slipped back ten steps, on which Karna also with such power Run an arrow that directly hit Arjun's chariot and his chariot slips back two steps
 karn ke aisa karne par bhagwaan krishna karn ki prashansa karne lage 
 When Arjuna asked Lord Krishna the reason for this praise of Karna, he said that i am sitting on your chariot carrying the weight of Tribhuvan and Hanumanji himself is sitting on the flag of your chariot
 use peeche khiskaana to dur ek anu ke baraabar hilaa paanaa bhi asambhav he, is par bhi yadi karn ne tumhaare rath ko do kadam peeche khiskaa diya to yah aashcharya hi nahin apitu prashansa or gaurav kii baat he Because of Karna's affection for Duryodhana, though reluctantly, he supported his beloved friend in all misdeeds towards the Pandavas
 karn ko pandavon ke prati duryodhana kii durbhaavnapurna yojanaon kaa gyaan tha
 He also knew that his fall was also certain due to hitting the truth for the sake of discrete
 jabaki kuch logon kaa yah maananaa he ki kuru rajsabha main draupadi ke liye 'vaishya' shabd kaa upyog karke karn ne apane naam par swayan kaalikh pot lee thi, vahiin kuch anya logon kaa maananaa he ki vah apane is krity main sahi tha, kyonki pehle draupadi ne use apane swayamvar main 'soot putr' kahkar uskaa apmaan kiya tha taaki vah uske swayamvar main pratiyogi naa ban sake
 Nevertheless, Karna's role in Abhimanyu's killing and the fight of one warrior to several warriors caused more damage to his image of a warrior and then the same momentum in the same war
 mahabharat kii kuch vyakhyyon ke anusaar, yahi vah krity tha jisane bhalee prakaar se ye pramanit kar diya kii karn yuddh main adharm ke paksh main lard rahaa he or is krity ke kaaran uske is durbhaagya kaa bhi nirdhaaran ho gaya kii vah bhi arjuna dwaara isi prakaar maaraa jayega jab vah shastrastra hin or rathhin ho or uski peeth arjuna kii ore ho
 Karna had full opportunity to kill Arjuna in the seventeenth day of war but following the war rules he did not shoot arrows at Arjuna because by then Suryadev had set
 karn or arjuna ke pichley janm kii katha kaa varnan padam puraana me ata he ek baar bhagwaan brahma or mahadev ke bich yuddh hota he, mahadev brahmaji ke paanchaven sar ko kaat dete he
 The pasina emerges from the body of the angry Brahmadeva
 or paseene se ek vir yoddha utpann hota he
 Born from Sveda, hence known as Svedja
 swedja pita brahma ke aadesh se mahadev se yuddh karne jaataa he
 Mahadev asks Lord Vishnu to explain some remedy to the Svedaja born by angry Brahma
 bhagwaan vishnu apane rakat se ek vir ko janm dete he
 Born from blood, therefore it is known as Raktaja
 swedja 1000 kavach ke saath janma tha or rakataja 1000 haath or 500 dhanush ke saath 
 Lord Brahma was also a son of Lord Vishnu, so Svedja was also a part of Lord Vishnu
 swedja or raktaja main bhayankar yuddh hota he
 Svedja cuts 998 hands of Raktaja and breaks 499 bows
 vahi raktaja swedja ke 999 kavach tod detaa he
 Raktaja is just about to lose
 bhagwaan vishnu samaj jate hai kii raktaja se haar jayega
 So they calm that war
 swedja daanveerta dikhaate hue raktaja ko jivandaan detaa he
 Lord Vishnu entrusts Svedaraja's accountability to Suryanarayana, and Raktaja's to Indradev
 vah indradev ko vachan dete he kii agle janm main raktaja apane pratidwandvi swedja kaa vadh avashya karegaa
 In Dwapara Yuga, Raktaja is born as Arjuna and sensation Karna
 or arjun apane sabase mahaan pratidwandvi karnaki yuddh ke niyamon ke viruddh hatya karte hai
 The following factors can be counted in relation to Karna's death: 1
 The first factor of Karna's death is Rishi Durvasa himself
 kunti ko yah vardaan dete samay kii vah kisi bhi dev kaa aahvaan karke unase santaan praapt kar sakati he, is vardaan ke parinaam ke bare main nahin bataaya
 Therefore, Kunti curiously calls Suryadev and does not care what the consequences are before marriage and according to the boon Suryadev gives a son to Kunti
 lekin lok-laaj ke bhay se kunti is shishu ko gangaji main baha deteen he
 Then Karna meets Maharaja Dhritarashtra's charioteer Adhirath and his wife Radha, they follow him and thus Karna's Kshatriya identity is denied
 karn, naa ki yudhisthir yaa duryodhana, hastinapur ke singhaasana kaa vaastavik adhikari tha, lekin yah kabhi ho naa sakaa kyonki uskaa janm or pahchaan gupt rakhe gaye
 2
 Devaraj Indra who brought Karna's Kshatriya identity as a scorpion in front of his guru and due to misinformation about his identity, his guru cursed him to forget his weapon knowledge at the right time
 3
 gaay vaale brahman kaa shraap kii jis prakaar usne ek asahaay or nirdosh pashu ko maaraa he usee prakaar vah bhi tab maaraa jayega jab vah sarvaadhik asahaay hoga or uskaa dhyaan apane shatru se alag kisi anya vastu par hoga
 Due to this curse, Arjun kills him when the wheel of his chariot gets stuck in the earth and he is focused on removing the wheel of his chariot
 4
 dharti mata kaa shraap kii vah niyat samay par uske rath ke pahie ko kha jaaegin or vah apane shatruon ke saamne sarvaadhik vivash ho jayega
 5
 Devotee Indra in the guise of a beggar, donating armor kundal sticking on his body due to his popular publicity by Karna
 6
 'shakti astr' kaa ghatotkach par chalaanaa, jiske kaaran vah vachananusaar duusari baar is astr kaa upyog nahin kar saktaa tha
 7
 Do not use 'nagastra' for the second time as promised to Mother Kunti
 8
 mata kunti ko die do vachan
 9
 Maharaj and maternal uncle of the Pandavas, the charioteer of Karna, who dropped the morale of Karna by praising Arjuna's martial arts in the seventeenth day of war
 10
 yuddh se kuch din purv jab karn ko yah gyaat hota he ki pandav uske bhai hai to unke prati uski sari durbhaavna samaapt ho gai, par duryodhana ke prati nishth hone ke kaaran vah pandavon ke viruddh ladaa
 However, until the death of Karna, the Pandavas did not know that Karna is his eldest brother
 11
 suryadev jo satrahawein din ke yuddh main tab ast ho gaye jab karn ke paas arjuna ko maarane kaa puraa avasar tha
 12
 Insulting Draupadi
 13
 shrikrishna dwaara arjuna ko yah aadesh dena kii vah karn kaa vadh kare jabaki vah apane rath ke dhanse pahie ko nikaal rahaa hota he
 14
 Bhishma Pitamah, because he did not command Karna to fight under his command
 <br C: Dhritarashtra and Pandu were born to Vyasa after the demise of Vichitravirya

 Wilhelm II or William II was the last emperor of Germany and king of Prussia who ruled the German Empire and Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918
 wiliam pratham kii mrityu ke uparant uskaa putr fadrik tritiy germany ke rajsinghaasana par 9 march 1888 i

 But he died after ruling only 100 days
 uski mrityu hone par uskaa putr wiliam dwitiya rajya singhaasana par asin hua
 He was a young man
 usamen anek gunon or durgunon kaa sammishran tha
 He was sharp-witted, ambitious, confident and an extraordinary young man
 vah swaarthee or ghamandi tha tathaa uskaa vishwaas raja ke daivi siddhant main tha
 It was unbearable for him to be in control of any other person, due to which he became estranged from his Chancellor Bismarck after a few days
 paristhitiyon se baadhya hokar bismark ko tyaag-patr dena padaa
 After the fall of Bismarck, William took all power into his own hands and his ministers became obedient servants and he became the helm of his own rule
 wiliam kaisar atyadhik hathi, mahatvakankshi evam krodhi vyakti tha
 He used to say that our future depends on the sea
 uske germany ko samudri shakti banane ke prayaas ne england kii sthaayee shatruta praapt kar lee thi
 His policy was- 'to establish his dominion over the whole world
 ' yadi isamen use safalataa na mili to vah vishwa ke sarvanaash ke liye tatpar tha
 England was not in favor of war as a trading country, which William Kaiser considered England's cowardice
 vah akramak ruukh apanaakaar england ko bhaybheet kar apane samrajya kaa vistaar karnaa chahta tha or yah galat samaj thi ki england kisi bhi keemat par yuddh taalna chahega
 Thus William Caesar's fiery, imperialist, autocratic and autocratic personality put Europe on the brink of a great war
 kaisar wiliam dwitiya kii vishwa niti ke nimnlikhit teen mukhya uddeshy the - In order to fulfill the above objectives, Kaiser William II began to conduct Germany's 'foreign policy'
 pratham uddeshy ke kaaran austria ke saath ghanisht mail aavashyak tha, kyonki vah bhi usee disha main bad kar selonika ke bandargah par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 This meant strengthening the diplomatic group of Central Europe
 austria or rus ke hiton main sangharsh hone ke kaaran iskaa arth rus se alag hatana or ant main use apana virdohi bana lenaa bhi tha
 The fulfillment of the second objective meant 'to demonstrate the power of Germany wherever necessary in the world, especially in Africa
 ' is sambandh main morocco ne france ko do baar 1905 i
 or 1911 i
 main chunauti di
 a clear result of the fulfillment of the third objective was intense competition and disharmony with England
 saransh main is nai niti kaa swaabhaavik parinaam hona tha, rus, france or england kii shatruta or ant main in teenon kaa uske mukaable main ekatrit ho janaa, arthath bismark ke samast kaary kaa vinaash
 William II destroyed his entire system with his policy
 teen varsh ke andar rus germany se alag ho gaya or baad main france se sandhi karke usne uske ekaakipan kaa ant kar diya
 England became an enemy within 6 years
 morocco main hastkshep karne sefrance se shatruta or bad gai or 1907 i
 tak germany, austria tathaa italy ke trigut ke mukaable main france, rus or england kii trirashtra maitri sthapit ho gai
 Italy's relationship with threesome was also getting relaxed, but William II did not make any effort in this direction
 1890 i
 main punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti hone vaali thi jo bismark dwaara germany or rus main hui thi, jabaki wiliam rus kii apeksha austria se sudrudh sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta tha jissevah balkan main hokar purvi bumadhyasaagar ko apane prabhaav kshetra main laane main safal ho sake
 Russia, too, refused the reiteration of this repatriation treaty, stating that 'the treaty is very complex and there is a threat to Austria, which can have disastrous consequences
 ' The apparent consequence of the non-recurrence of the Treaty of Resettlement was that Russia remained alone
 usko apane ekaakipan ko dur karne ke liye ek mitra kii khoj kerani anivaary ho gai
 Now England and France were his enemies in front of him
 kintu apni paristhiti se baadhya hokar vah france se mitrataa karne kii ore aakarshith hua or usase mitrataa karne kaa praytn karne laga
 Finally, in 1895 AD, the treaty took place in both the countries, which is known as the Dwight Treaty
 is sandhi se france ko atyadhik laabh hua or uskaa akelaapan samaapt ho gaya
 William was very ambitious
 vah germany ko europe kaa bhagya-nirmaataa hi nahin, varan vishwa kaa bhagya-nirmaataa bananaa chahta tha
 Bismarck wanted to keep Germany apart from world conflicts, but William started interfering in conflicts outside of Europe
 vah keval balkan prayadweep main hi german-prabhaav se santusht nahin tha, varan vah to usko vishwa-shakti ke rup main dekhnachahta tha
 For this purpose, world-wide policy was incorporated into Germany's foreign policy after 1890 AD
 wiliam ke anek bhaashanon se uske in vichaaron kaa digdarshan hota he
 He gave these territories in his possession - wiliam turki ko apane prabhaav-kshetra ke antargat laana chahta tha or yah uski vishwa niti kaa ek pramukh ang tha
 England was also trying in this direction
 vah kisi europea raashtra kaa prabhutv turki main sthapit nahin hone dena chahta tha, kyonki aisa hone se uske bhartiya samrajya ko bhay utpann ho saktaa tha
 England was dominated by Turkey until the berlin-congress of 1878, and whenever a European nation thought of making progress towards it, England strongly opposed it, but after the Cyprus agreement, its influence would be less than on Turkey
 felt
 jab england kaa 1882 i
 main misr par adhikaar hua to england or turki ke madhya jo rahi-sahi sadbhaavna vidyaman thi uskaa bhi ant hona aarambh ho gaya
 Now William II took advantage of this situation and tried to bring Turkey into his sphere of influence
 is sambandh main usne nimna upaay kiye- There was also the construction of a rail till Kustuntunia
 is maarg ke khul jane se germany kaa sampark faras kii khadi tak ho jaataa jo england ke bhartiya samrajya ke liye vishesh chintaa kaa vishay ban jaataa
 William must have succeeded in attracting Turkey, but by this policy he made Russia, France and England his enemy, while the power of Turkey was negligible in front of these three big nations
 wiliam kii is niti ko safal niti nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He unhappy the three nations together, as a result of which it was possible to form a three-party faction
 1890 i
 tak germany or england ke sambandh achche the, kintu jab wiliam dwitiya ke shasankaal main germany ne vishwavyaapee niti ko apnaanaa aarambh kiya to germany or england ke sambandh katu honearambh ho gayi
 After Bismarck's resignation, William began to expand in the German navy, England became increasingly suspicious of Germany's growing power
 kuch samay takadonon main maitri kaa haath badha, kintu 1896 i
 ke uparaant donon ke sambandh katu hone aarambh hote gayi
 When William sent a telegram of congratulations to the President of Transvaal, Kruger, conquering James's invasion
 is taar se england kii janata main bada kshebh utpann hua
 Queen Victoria also strongly condemned this work of her grandson William II
 is samay england ne germany se sambandh bigaadna uchit nahin samajha, kyonki aisa karne par vah akelaa rah jaataa
 For this purpose, he tried to establish good relations with Germany
 1898 i
 main africa ke sambandh main tathaa 1899 i
 main senaaon ke sambandh main donon deshon ke samjhaute bhi hue
 In the same year, Joseph Chamberlain, the colonization minister of England, proposed the construction of a ternary in England, Germany and the United States, but in 1899, Beulo, who was then Prime Minister of Germany, did not accept the proposal
 uskaa is prastaav ke asweekaar karne kaa kaaran yah tha ki iske dwaara england kaa aashay yah he ki aagaamee yudhon main germany, england kaa paksh le or uske samarthak ke rup main yuddh main bhaag le or england europea mahadweep se nishcint hokar asia tathaa africa main apane samrajya kaa vistaar karata rahe
 Beulo was of the view that inconvenience to England was inevitable due to Germany's colonial, mercantilist and navigational advancement and could lead to war at both times
 atah germany kii nitiyon dwaara england bhalee prakaar samaj gaya ki germany par adhik vishwaas karnaa england ke liye ghaatak siddh hoga or vastav main ek din aisa avashya aayega jab england or germany kaa yuddh hoga
 Friendship between France and Russia had been established, now the work of friendship between Russia and England started by France
 1907 i
 main france ke praytn se rus or england kaa gut taiyaar ho gaya
 This group was defensive, but the German Emperor William II was concerned about its creation
 ab usne apana dhyaan is gut ke ant karne kii ore vishesh rup se aakarshith kiya
 At the same time, Germany had the opportunity to intervene in the eastern problem and humiliate Russia
 1908 i 
 turki main ek aandolan hua jo yuva turk aandolan ke naam se prasiddh he
 Austria soon took possession of Bosnia and Herzegovina
 srbija yah sahan nahin kar sakaa or usne yuddh kii taiyaari karnaa aarambh kar diya
 He hoped that Russia and England would be ready to help him against Austria and Germany, but Russia did not yet have such a situation
 austria ne srbija ke saath bada kathor vyavhaar kiya jiske kaaran yuddh kaa hona anivaary sa dikhne laga, kintu jab germany ne spasht ghoshnaa kar di ki yadi rus srbija kii kisi prakaar se sahaayta karegaa, to vah yuddh main austria kii purna rup se sahaayta karne ko taiyaar he
 Thus the war was averted
 is samay rus main itani shakti nahin thi ki vah germany or austria kii sammilit sevaaon kaa safaltaapurvak saamana kar saktaa
 Russia was forced to subdue and German politics succeeded in the Balkan Peninsula
 yadhyapi german-samraat wiliam kaisar balkan pradesh main rus ko nicha dikhalaane main safal hua or vah apane mitra austria kii shakti kaa vistaar tathaa prabhaav main vruddhi karvaa sakaa, kintu phir bhi vah france, rus or england ke gut se bhaybheet bana rahaa
 He began to move towards befriending France and Russia
 8 farvari 1909 i
 ko usne france se ek samjhauta kiya jiske anusaar france ne morocco kii swatantraaa evam akhandta ke siddhant ko sweekaar kar liya
 Germany accepted France's extraordinary position regarding Morocco's internal security
 idhar nishcint hokar germany ne apana dhyaan rus se samjhauta karne kii ore aakarshith kiya
 Germany signed an agreement with Russia in November 1910 regarding its interests in Mesopotamia and Persia, by which 'russia pledged not to oppose the berlin-baghdad railway plan to Germany, and William acknowledged Russia's interests in Persia
 Of
 ' By the above works, William II succeeded in weakening the faction of Russia, France and England, but this situation could not be sustained for long
 morocco ke prashn kaa samaadhaan karne kaa praytn france or germany dwaara kiya gaya tha, kintu donon samjhaute kii sthiti se santusht nahin the
 There was a natural opposition to the 'independence of Morocco' and the French police power, which was sure to cause a quarrel in the future
 france morocco ko purnataya apane adhikaar main laane par tula hua tha or germany use rokane yaa uske badale main upyukt puraskaar praapt karne par katibaddh tha
 1911 AD In Morocco, an incident occurred which attracted the attention of the major nations of Europe
 morocco main grihayuddh kii agni prajjwalit hui or morocco kaa sultan is vidroh kaa daman karne main asafal rahaa
 After this situation arose, France sent an army, pretending to be responsible for internal security, which started suppressing the rebellion in Morocco on 21 May 1910 AD
 germany france ke is prakaar ke hastkshep ko sahan nahin kar sakaa or germany ke videshmantri ne ghoshnaa kii ki 'yadi france ko morocco main rahanaa aavashyak prathit hua to morocco kii purna samasya par punah vichaar kiya jaayegaa or eljisiraj ke act par hastakshar karne vaali samast sattaaon ko apni icchaanusaar kaary karne kii swatantraaa punah praapt ho jaayegi
 After the suppression of the foreigners, the French forces returned, but even then Germany did not think it necessary to make any changes in its strict behavior
 july 1910 i
 ko germany ne ghoshnaa kii ki usne german hiton tathaa german nivaasiyon kii raksha ke abhipraay se ek jangi jahaaj dakshini morocco ke agedir naamak bandargah par bhej diya
 This behavior of Germany created a very critical situation and it became clear that the possibility of war between the nations of Europe was inevitable soon
 ant main france or german ke madhya sandhi ho gai jo ki 4 navambar 1911 ko sampann hui, jiske anusaar yah nishchay hua ki morocco par france kaa sangrakshan purvawat bana rahe or germany ko french congon kaa aadha pradesh praapt hua
 Germany had to face the question of Morocco, because the three-nation faction of Russia, France and England was now more firm and stable than before and relations between Germany and England started getting worse day by day
 bhaap tarabine vah yantric yukti he jo daabit bhaap se ooshmiya urja nikaalkar ise yantric kaary main badalati he
 It was invented in 1884 by Sir Charles Parsons in modern form
 bhaap tarabine ek mulchaalak he, jisamen bhaap kii ushma-urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kar, ucch gatisheel bhaap ko ek ghurnak par bandhe hue bahut se falkon par takaraayaa jaataa he, jisase falak paribhraman karte hai evam isse kaary hota he
 In a reciprocating steam engine, the piston is acted upon by the static pressure of the steam
 yadhyapi ingine main bhaap piston ke saath chalati he, phir bhi ingine kii kriya main bhaap kii gatij urja kaa prabhaav naganay he
 Steam turbines can have higher speeds than steam engines and the speed can be larger
 tarabine ke purjon kaa santulan acha rahata he
 The same amount of steam and the same state of steam turbine can produce more power than a steam engine
 bhaap ingine se kuch varsh kaam lene ke baad bhaap kii khapat bad jaati he, parantu tarabine main aisi avasthaa nahin aati prithvi par ke sabhi mul chaalkon main bhaap tarabine sabase adhik tikaoo hota he
 The biggest advantage of a turbine is that it provides the rotor speed directly, while the steam engine has to handle separate materials to achieve rotational speed
 vaashpitra main bhaap kaa janan ucch daab evam adhitaap par hota he
 When this steam approaches the turbine, it has a high amount of heat energy and its pressure is so high that it can circulate to low pressure
 parantu us samay isaki gatij urja naganya hoti he
 Therefore, before steam can do some work, its heat energy is converted into kinetic energy
 yah parivartan, acchhee tarah abhikalpit upkaran main, bhaap ko vistaarit karne se hota he
 The diffusion of steam is accomplished either in a single action, or in different actions
 iskaa arth yah hota he ki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit karne ke liye bahut se sthir upkaran vyavhaar main laae jate hai or praaia: do sthir upkarnon ke bich ek gatiman upkaran laga rahata he
 The kinetic energy received in the stationary device is then applied to work on the bonded moving device
 vishwa kaa sarvapratham ghurnan ingine san 50 i
 main ailexandria ke hero ne banaaya tha
 It contained a hollow ball between two nails
 tarabine ke nichle bhaag main bhaap banane ke liye baratan rakhaa hua tha, jisase bhaap us gend main pravesh kar sakati thi
 From there the steam came out through two triangular tubes fitted in the ball, due to which the ball kept moving
 yah tarabine bahut hi saadhaaran tha
 Based on the Hero's turbine, a number of scientists undertook explorations for its development
 tab se vibhinn abhikalp ke tarabine banaae gaye, kintu ve sabhi namoonay ke rup main hi rahe
 To implement those turbines was not considered profitable
 sarvapratham safal tarabine giovanni vranka ne 1629 i
 main banaaya tha
 This was the first impulse turbine
 bhaap tarabine mukhyat: do prakaar ke hote hai: In this turbine, steam is transmitted only to the tund
 gatiman falkon se hokar guzarane main bhaap kii daab main kuch bhi parivartan nahin hota, arthath falkon ke pravesh or nikaas sire par bhaap kii daab samaan hi rahati he
 Steam flows through several rows of moving panels, and the kinetic energy changes as a useful function in this flow
 is tarah ke tarabinon main pratham safal tarabine di labal kaa tarabine tha yah ek aavegchakra he, jiske upar paridhi par lage hue tundon se bhaap nikalakar takaraati he
 The steam is fully expanded in the pool
 ye tund chakra kii sparsharekha se 150 se 200 tak ke kone par jhuke rahete hai
 The smallest de Laval turbine was built of a 5-inch diameter circle and was run at 30,000 revolutions per minute
 yah nimna daab bhaap ke liye upyukt he
 The entry and exit angles of such turbine panels are the same
 is prakaar ke tarabine main bhaap kaa purna rup se prasar ek kriya main nahin hota
 Steam coming out of the first stationary line hits the moving pane
 jaise jaise bhaap falkon se hokar pravaahit hoti he, vaise vaise iskaa prasar hota jaataa he
 Therefore, in this type of turbine, the plank also acts as a tank
 gatiman falkon dwaara bhaap ke prasaarit kiye jane par bhaap kii gatij urja main kuch vruddhi ho jaati he
 In this way its panes function as well as circulate steam
 in falkon ko saath hi saath prerit evam pratikriya balon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 That is why such turbine is called 'impulse response turbine'
 vastut: yah namakaran ashuddh he, kyonki keval shuddh pratikriya tarabine naam kaa koi bhi tarabine nahin hota
 There are two main examples of such turbines: - 1884 i
 main parson ne pratham aaveg pratikraya tarabine banaaya tha
 In this, steam flows through the vane in a direction parallel to the axis of the turbine cycle
 is tarah ke tarabine ko akshapravaah tarabine bhi kehete hai
 Pans located in parson turbines are made all in motion
 is tarabine main falak traigy disha main lage rahete hai, jisase bhaap chakra ke aksh ke nikat falak ke sire par pravesh karti he or paridhi kii ore pravaahit hoti he
 Due to this the flow in this turbine is radius
 iske sivaay isamen ek mahatvapurn antar yah he ki donon tarah ke falak vipareet dishaao main chalate hai, jisase ucch aapekshik veg praapt hota he
 Generally, following parts are fitted in steam turbine: bhaap tarabine main sabase mukhya iske falak hai
 Other parts of this device remain for the use of these panels
 bina falak ke shakti praapt nahin ho sakati evam falkon main jaraa sa bhi dosha rahane se tarabine kii dakshata main kami aa jaati he
 For its manufacture, such materials are needed which can withstand high stress as well as high stress
 aadhunik ucch taap or ucch pratibal vaale tarabinon ke falkon ke liye aloh varg ke dravyon kaa vyavhaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki taap ke saath inaki tanaav kshamta main bhi kami aa jaati he
 Nowadays, the focus of scientists towards the development of non-renewable steel
 adarsh falak vahi he jo ucchtam dakshata kaa hote hue ek samaan pratibalit ho
 Such a state can be achieved by hollow faces
 iske sivaay khokhale falak paribhramak par teevr pratibal nahin daalate
 This results in higher speed, and more power can be achieved
 tarabine main pravan falkon kaa bhi vyavhaar kiya jaataa he, jisase iske upar kam pratibal pade
 In all steam turbines, the flux is proportional to steam acceleration
 yadi bhaap ko vaashpitra daab se sanghanak daab tak ek hi charan main prasaarit kiya jaay, to prasar ke ant main bhapagati atyadhik ho jaaegi
 If this high speed steam is treated in a plank, it will give the cruising speed extremely high, which is too much for practical purposes
 paribhramak kii is ucch gati ko kam karne ke liye bahut si pranaliyaan khoji garh hai
 All of these systems use a number of truncates
 iske liye ek hi isha par bahut se paribhramak ek kram chaabi kii sahaayta se bandhe rahete hai
 As the steam flows through the moving pins, the steam is absorbed in those phases
 is kriya ko 'sangyojan' kehete hai
 The main ways of reducing the cruiser speed are: sthir falkon kii panktiyon dwaara pruthak kii hui, gatiman falkon kii panktiyaan tarabine ish par bandhi rahati hai
 The steam propagates from the evaporator pressure to the condensate pressure into the bottleneck, achieving higher speeds
 iske baad ucch-gati-bhaap gatiman falkon kii pratham pankti dwaara pravaahit hoti he, jisamen isaki gati kaa kuch bhaag avashoshit hota he or baaki sthir falkon kii agali pankti main pravesh karata he
 These change the direction of steam without changing the steady vane speed
 tab bhaap gatiman falak kii duusari pankti main pravesh karti he
 Some other part of the speed of steam is absorbed in this second speed line
 jyon jyon bhaap aage kii phalkapanktiyon dwaara pravaahit hoti he, is kram kii punrariti hoti rahati he
 In this way the entire kinetic energy of steam is absorbed
 isamen gatiman falkon kii panktiyaan, jinamein prayek ke baad sthir tonti kii ek pankti hoti he, kram main tarabine isha par chaabi dwaara lagi rahati he
 In this, the full pressure of the steam is not only in the first row of the cable spout, but it is equally divided in all the rows of the spout
 vaashpitra se bhaap tonti kii pratham pankti main pravesh karti he, jisamen yah anshat: prasaarit hoti he
 It then flows through the first moving pane, where almost all of its kinetic energy is absorbed
 is pankti se nikalakar yah tonti kii duusari pankti main pravesh karti he, jahaan yah pun: anshat: prasaarit hoti he
 This causes some decrease in pressure again
 toti kii duusari pankti dwaara praapt gatij urja agali gatiman phalkapankti main avashoshit hoti he
 This action continues until the entire pressure is absorbed into the turbine
 daab sangyojan kaa yah tarika ratu evam joyali tarabine main vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 Such a turbine uses both of the above methods
 bhaap kaa purna daabpaat sabhi charnon main vibhakt kiya jaat he or prayek charan main praapt gati ko bhi sanyojit kar diya jaataa he
 This has the advantage that high pressure is attained in each phase, as a result of which fewer steps are required
 isiilie is tarah ke tarabine kaa aakaar chota hota he
 The Curtis turbine is similar to this
 tarabine ke gatiman falak ke pravesh evam nikaas sire par bhaap kii vibhinn gatiyon ko veg aarekh dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 In an ideal turbine, the work done by steam is equal to the Rankine work, that is, it will be equal to the thermodynamic heat
 vyavhaar main honevaali anek haniyon dwaara yah kaary atyant kam ho jaataa he
 The first loss occurs in the veg valve, where steam pressure is reduced from 5 to 10 percent by intercept
 ucch-daab-tonti-peti main gharshan evam bhanvar dwaara bhaap kii daab main phir kuch kami ho jaati he, kintu sabase adhik haani tonti main hoti hai
 Small panels are not suitable for thermal efficiency, but if the height of the pane is increased, the high pressure steam does not cover the entire circumference of the first stage due to the greater condensation and finite volume of steam, leading to partial penetration
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki jo falak bhaap ke jet ke prabhaav ke andar nahin hote, ve aavaran main bhari hui bhaap kaa manthan karte rahete hai
 Due to this, there is loss of fan or wind
 ucchdaab tarabine kaa paribhramak bhi swayan ghaney madhyam main chalata he, jisamen ise atyant taral avrodh kaa saamana karnaa padataa he evam iske kaaran chakti-gharshan-haani hoti he
 These losses of steam flowing through different stages in the turbine are always encountered
 jyon-jyon bhaap kii ghanata main kami hoti jaati he, tyon tyon ye haniyaan bhi kam hoti jaati hai
 Apart from these, there is also radiation loss
 vering main gharshan dwaara bhi haniyaan hoti hai
 After working in the turbine, steam enters the condenser and at this time it also has some velocity
 is gatij urja kii haani ko antim yaa avshisht haani kehete hai
 This system is used to increase the efficiency of the turbine plant
 isamen bhaap a, ba or sa teen binduon se tarabine se nikaalkar teen taapakon main bheji jaati he
 Steam from the final heater enters the reservoir in a humid state, through which the runoff flows
 chunki bharnajal bhaap se adhik thanda rahata he, at: yah bhaap se garmi lekar swayan garam ho jaataa he
 The fill water goes from one heater to another, then from the second to the third
 antim taapak se nikalakar bharnajal atyant garam ho jaataa he, jisase vaashpitra main taap kii bachat hoti he
 This increases the efficiency of the turbine plant
