 This is often a sign of being the homeland of a language, so linguists believe that the adi-austronesian ancestor language originated here and then this language-family began to spread from here
 is vichaar ke anusaar aadi-austronishian samskruti sabase pehle taiwan main aaj se 5,500 varsh purv panpi thi
 Some linguists disagree with this ideology and based on genetic maternal clusters, it is likely that the oldest Austronesian culture actually originated somewhere near the island of Sulawesi 13,000–17,000 years ago and originated from the rise of the sea at the end of the last ice age
 Due to social instability, it began to spread outside its motherland

 gulab jamun ek prakaar kaa pakwaan he jo maide, khoye tathaa chini se banaaya jaataa he
 There is also a fruit called Galab Jamun, which very few people know about
 gulab jamun banane ke liye pratikilo khoye me sau gram maida milaaye |isamen thoda beking soda milaayen
 Now knead it well
 gulab jamun to lagbhag sabhi kii pasandida mithai he
 Often you will eat them at a special festival or function or sometimes by bringing it with a bajar
 par kya kabhi aapane inhen ghar par banaaya he? yadi nahin to aaj banaakar dekhiye
 Gulab Jamuns are made in two ways
 maave main thodaa sa maida mila kar or maave main paneer mila kar
 Gulab Jamuns made in both ways look very tasty
 aaiye aaj ham maave main paneer mila kar gulab jamun banaate hai
 Time: around 1-1
1 / 2 hr required material: vidhi:chaashni banane kaa tarika- Combine sugar and half the amount of sugar in a vessel and keep it cooking on the gas
 jab chaashni main ubaal aa jaae or sari chini pani main achche se ghul jaae, uske baad 1-2 minute tak or pakaayen
 Then take 1-2 drops of syrup solution and drip it in the plate and try sticking it between thumb and finger
 yadi chaashni ungali va anguuthe ke bich chipak rahi ho to samajhiye kii vah ban gai he or yadi naa chipke to use thodaa or pakaa lijiye
 When it starts sticking, cool and sieve
 gulab jamun banane kaa tarika- Put mawa, paneer and maida in a wide and large vessel and knead soft and smooth dough
 gulab jamun banane ke liye maava taiyaar he
 Now take out a little mawa from it with the help of fingers and flatten it by placing it on the palm
 3-4 kaashew ke tukade or ek kishmish uske upar rakh kar maave ko chaaron ore se uthaa kar band kar dijiye or donon hatheliyon ke bich rakh kar gol karke plate main rakh lijiye
 Prepare all the shells in this way

 antarrashtriya sambandh vibhinn deshon ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he, saath hi saath samprabhu rajyon, antar-sarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon or bahurashtriya companiyon kii bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan he
 International relations is also sometimes referred to as 'international study'), although the two terms are not entirely synonymous
 saadhaaran shabdon main 'antarrashtriya raajnneeti' kaa arth he 'rajyon ke madhya raajnneeti karnaa'
 If we study the meaning of 'politics' three major elements emerge - the existence of groups; Consent between groups; And fulfill their interests by groups
 is aashay ko yadi antarrashtriya str par akalan karen to ye teen tatv mukhya rup se - rajyon kaa astitv; rajyon ke bich sangharsh; tathaa apane rashtrahiton kii purti hetu shakti kaa prayog
 Therefore, international politics is to study the actions under which states struggle on the basis of power to fulfill their national interests
 is sandarbh main rashtriya hit antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke pramukh lakshya hote hai; sangharsh iskaa disha nirdesh tay karti he; tathaa shakti is uddeshy prapti kaa pramukh saadhan mana jaataa he
 But we can consider the above definition as traditional, because today 'international politics' has been replaced by the broader concept 'international relations'
 iske antargat rajyon ke paraspar sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyogaatmak pahaluon ko bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, apart from 'states', many other factors have now become the subject area of international politics
 atah iske antargat aaj vyakti, sanstha, sanghathan va kai anya gaiyr-rajya ikaiyaan bhi sammilit ho gai hai
 Its present base and subject area has taken a very wide form today
 in sabhi vishyon par charchaa se pehle alag-alag vidwaanon dwaara di gai nimna paribhaashaon kii samiksha karnaa ati anivaary ho jaataa he- The scope of these definitions is very limited, because basically 'states' have been considered as factors of international politics
 yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop tak hi simit he
 Mainly hannes j
 Margenthau, Harald Sprout, Bon Dyk, Thompson, etc
 are its main supporters, which is clear from their definitions- naveen paribhaashaon main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vyapak swaroop antarrashtriya sambandhon kii charchaa kii gai he
 In addition to the state, new factors of international politics such as international organizations, longitude groups, ngos, international institutions, some individuals etc
 have also been included
 iske atirikt isamen sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyog tathaa raajnneeti ke saath-saath pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main ise prabhavit karne vaale arthath, saanskrithik, dharmik, saamaajik, vigyaan evam takniki aadi pahaluon kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The following definitions of various authors reveal this meaning very clearly
 is prakaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop prarambh se vartmaan tak bahut vyapak ho jaataa he
 It has included the study of various world units and organizations along with nation states today
 parantu in sabhi parivartanon ke baad bhi in adhyayanon kaa kendra bindu aaj bhi raashtra rajya hi he
 Based on the above definitions, the following conclusions about the nature of international politics emerge
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop parivartansheel he
 Whenever the environment, factors and developments of international politics will change, changes in methods and approaches to study it are also inevitable
 iske atirikt, yah parivartan sthai na hokar nirantar he
 Along with this, it is very complex due to various factors, levels, dimensions, etc
 Therefore, a smooth, rational, comprehensive approach is required for its smooth study
 jaisaa uparyukt paribhaashaon evam swaroop se gyaat he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Today its subject area has become quite extensive, under which the following things are studied: atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra aaj bahut vyapak va jatil hone ke saath-saath vikaas kii ore agrasar he
 Under this, the study of various traditional factors as well as non-traditional factors is also becoming important
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa itihaas zyada pracheen nahin he, balki yah vishay beesvin shatabdi kii upaj he
 Clearly, its history begins with the establishment of the international Woodrow Wilson Chair in Welles University in 1919
 is peeth par pratham asin hone vaale prasiddh itihaaskaar professor aloard jimrn the tathaa baad main anya pramukh viddhan jinhone is peeth ko sushobhit kiya unamem se pramukh the - si

 At the same time similar arrangements were seen in other universities and institutes
 atah pichhali ek shatabdi ke is vishay ke itihaas par drushtipaat karen to is vishay main aaye utaar-chadhaav ke saath-saath iske ek swytt vishay main sthapit hone ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 Multidimensional changes in this subject have helped to enhance, coordinate and develop the content on the one hand, and on the other hand by rendering various theories, it has helped in understanding many complex problems and aspects
 kenneth thampsan ne san 1962 ke 'rivyuu of politics' main prakashit apane lekh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko chaar bhaagon main baanta he, jiske aadhaar par is vishay kaa suspasht evam sunishchit adhyayan sambhav ho saktaa he
 These four stages of development can also include the fifth phase of the post-cold War era
 inkaa vistrut varnan nimna prakaar se he- Before the First World War, only scholars of history, law, political science, philosophy etc
 considered different aspects of international politics
 mukhya rup se itihaaskaar hi iskaa adhyayan rajanyik itihaas tathaa anya deshon ke saath sambandhon ke itihaas ke rup main karte the
 Under this, there was an account of the work done by diplomats and foreign ministers
 atah ise kootnithik itihaas kii sangya bhi di jaati he
 According to EH Kar, before World War I, the relation of war was understood only to the soldiers and its equivalent international politics was related to diplomats
 iske atirikt, prajatantric deshon main bhi paramparaagat rup se videsh niti ko dalgat raajnneeti se alag rakhaa jaataa tha tathaa chune hue ang bhi apane aapako videshi mantralay par ankush rakhane main asamarth mahasoos karte the
 Prior to 1919, there were several major reasons for apathy towards the subject - First, till this time it was believed that war and alliance among states were as natural as poverty and unemployment
 atah yuddh, videsh niti evam rajyon ke madhya paraspar sambandhon ko roak paanaa maanviya samarthy ke vash se baahar mana jaataa tha
 Second, before World War I, wars were not so fierce
 tritiy, sanchaar sadhano ke abhaav main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kuch gine chune rajyon tak hi simit thi
 Thus the biggest shortcoming of the study of international politics in this era was the development of general interests
 is kaal main keval rajanyik itihaas kaa varnanaatmak adhyayan maatra hi hua
 As a result, it helped to understand neither the current nor future international politics
 is yug kii maatra uplabdhi 1919 main wales vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke peeth kii sthapana rahi
 In the period between the two world wars, two parallel currents developed
 jinamein se pratham ke antargat purv aitihaasikta ke prati prabhutv ko chhodkar samayik ghatnaon / samasyao ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya jane laga
 Along with this, an attempt has also been made to combine historical political studies with the current political contexts
 aitihaasik prabhaav ke kam hone ke baad bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu ek samgr drushtikon kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 During this period, a lot of emphasis was placed on the study of the present, but the importance of the mutual relationship between the present and the past is still not recognized
 iske atirikt, na hi yudhottar raajnneetik samasyaon ko ateet kii tulaneey samasyaon ke saath rakhkar dekhne kaa prayaas hi kiya gaya
 Perhaps this is why even in this era two fundamental deficiencies were clearly revealed
 pratham, pehle charan kii hi bhaanti is kaal main bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saarvbhaumik siddhanth kaa vikaas nahin ho sakaa
 Second, even today the study of international politics could not become more explicit and rational
 is prakaar is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan main bal dene kii sthiti main badlaav ke atirikt bahut zyada parivartan dekhne ko nahin mila tathaa na hi is vishay ke spasht rup se swatantra anushaasan banane kii pushti hui
 The third phase of the development of international politics was also a period between two world wars parallel to the second phase
 ise sudhaarwad kaa yug isliye kaha jaataa he ki isamen rajyon dwaara raashtra sangh kii sthapana ke kadhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti main sudhaar kii kalpana kii gai
 In this era, there was mainly institutional development
 is kaal ke vidwaanon, rajanyikon, rajanetaaon va chintakon kaa maananaa tha ki yadi antarrashtriya sansthaaon kaa vikaas ho jaataa he to vishwa samudaay ke sammukh upasthit yuddh va shanti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan sambhav ho sakegaa
 For this purpose some legal and ethical approaches were structured which had the following main grounds
 inhen aadarshik evam naitik mulyon par bal dete hue antarrashtriya sanghathan kii pariklpana kii gai
 After its establishment, it was believed that the struggle to make peace between the states in international relations is over
 nai vyavastha ke antargat shakti santulan kaa koi sthaan nahin hoga
 Now the states will settle their disputes through the Union
 atah is yug main na keval yuddh va shaanti kii samasyaon kaa vivechan kiya, apitu iske doorgaami sudhaaron ke bare main bhi sochaa gaya
 Hence, the main points of the study were also to change the nature of international politics through legal problems and development of organizations
 antatah is kaal main bhavatmak, kalpanasheel va naitik sudhaarwad par adhik bal diya gaya he
 But there was always a question mark on the significance of these approaches between the World Wars
 raashtra sangh kii pratham ek dashak kii gatividhiyon se jahaan aashaa kii kiran dikhaai di, vahiin duusare dashak kii yarthathwaadee sthiti ne is dharna ko bilkul samaapt kar diya
 Non-cooperation and factionalism among the big powers gave rise to a power struggle system instead of establishing peace
 japan ne manchuriya par hamale karke jahaan shanti ko bhang kar diya vahiin italy, germany va rus ne bhi vivaadaaspad sthitiyon main na keval raashtra sangh kii sadsyta hi chodi, balki dwitiya vishwayuddh ke prarambh hone kii prakriya ko or teevr bana diya
 In this way, the world system could not run with peace, morality and law, then the realist approach was strengthened as an alternative approach due to writers like EH Kar, Shumbha, Quincy Right
 is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti main moolbhoot parivartanon se na keval isaki vishaywastu vyapak hui balki isamen bahut jatiltaayen bhi paidaa ho gai
 Changes in the nature of politics and the rise of new states during the Cold War era changed the entire international environment
 parinamswaroop naye upagamon, ayaamon, sansthaaon va pravritiyon kaa sarjan hua jinke madhyam se antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa adhyayan sunishchit ho gaya
 The failures of the ideal, institutional, ethical, legal and reformist streams of the earlier stages led to the development of new approaches
 yah nayaa upagam tha-yatharthwaad
 Although EH Karr, Schwarzenberger, Quincy Right, Shubhan etc
 developed this approach, but Hanes J
 Margenthau presented it as a general principle
 is siddhanth ke anusaar rajya hameshaa apane hiton kii purti hetu sangharshrat rahete hai
 Therefore, to understand international politics, it is very important to understand the various aspects of this power struggle
 yathartwaadee drushtikon ke saath antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke sunishchit va suspasht vikaas ke rup main antarrashtriya sanghathan kii bhi utpatti hui
 Now the form of this organization emerged as an important political organization rather than an idealistic and reformist
 iske antargat maanavjaati ko yuddh kii vibheeshikaa se bachaane ke saath-saath rajyon ke madhya sangharsh ke koun-koun se kaaran hai? vishvashanti hetu khatre ke koun-koun se kaarak hai? shanti kii sthapana kaise ho sakati he? shastron kii hode ko kaise roka ja saktaa he? aadi kai prakaar ke prashnon kaa samaadhaan dhundne ke prayaas bhi kiye gaye
 Along with the above two trends, the origin of behaviorism was also an important achievement of this era
 vyavahaaravaadi drushtikon ke madhyam se ”vyavastha siddhanth“ kii utpatti kar antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Under this approach, it is considered necessary to study three major factors for the study of states
 ye kaarak the- The main force of the above trends has been to promote the ideology of international politics
 atah is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke saarvbhaumik siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karnaa ati mahatvapurn kaary rahaa he
 As a result of this process of theory formation, many partial theories like - realism, theory of balance, communication theory, sports theory, bargaining theory, peace research approach, system theory, world order model etc
 were created
 in siddhanton ke pratipaadan ke baavjood is yug main kisi ek saarvbhaumik va saamaanya siddhanth kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 In the 1990s, Jayant Bandhopadhyay, in his book - General Theory of International Relations - has tried to overcome the shortcomings of Martin Kaplan's administrative theory, but he is still in a period of debate
 atah saiddhantikaran ke mukhya daur ke baavjood shityudh kaaleen yug apni vaicharik sankeernata va algaav ke kaaran kisi ek saamaanya siddhanth ke pratipaadan se vanchit rahaa
 In the post-cold War era, all nations started joining together under one economic system
 isiilie ab vaishvikaran, udaarikaran, mukt bazaar vyavastha aadi kaa daur prarambh ho gaya
 In this context, not only the importance of economic issues increased, but the importance of international politics also increased
 aaj rashtriyata evam antarrashtriyata kaa vibhed samaapt ho gaya iske atirikt, ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay suchi main kaaphi naveen vishyon kaa samavesh ho gaya jo rashtriya na rahakar ab maanavjaati kii samasyaon ke rup main ubhar kar aaye
 Among the major problems of the current world, terrorism, environment, depletion of ozone layer, trafficking of drugs and drugs, human rights abuses etc
, major issues have emerged which have become mandatory to solve at international level rather than at national level or regional level
 
 saiddhanthik str par bhi 1945 se 1991 tak ke saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana ke prayaas ko dhakka laga
 Priorities in this context of international politics have now changed
 uttar-aadhuniktawaad main ab saarvbhaumik siddhanton kii sarthakata par prashn chihn lag rahe hai
 The influence of historical context and ancient environment is also being denied
 ab swatantra mudde adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 Great principles have become secondary
 nae sandarbh main aanshik shodh adhik mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For example, with more emphasis on the topics of feminism, human rights, environment etc
, thinking has also started
 atah shityudhottar yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop, vishay suchi evam vishay kshetra purna rup se parivartit ho gaye hai
 Now too much emphasis is not being laid on the general theoretical establishment
 isiilie is badale hue parivesh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti mahatvapurn hi nahin, apitu swaittata kii ore agrasar prathit ho rahi he
 And there are optimistic signs for the subject's autonomy
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ne na keval antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko moolbhoot rup main prabhavit kiya apitu kai mahatvapurn muddon kii abhivyakti bhi kii
 Changes in the factors of international politics, broadening of factors, rendering of new principles etc
 Apart from many topics, the entire environment of international politics has changed itself
 jahaan ek ore saiddhanthik str par yatharthwaad va adarshavaad ke vaad-vivaad tathaa pracheen va vaigyaniktaa par vaad-vivaad ho rahaa he, vahiin duusari ore vyavhaarik str par antarrashtriya sambandh vishay ke praaroop ke bare main vivaadaaspad prashn uth rahe the ki - kya antarrashtriya sambandh ek swytt vishay he yaa nahin? yadhyapi aaj adhiktar vishvavidhyalayon main snaatak va snatakottar staron par tathaa shodh hetu yah ek swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he, tathaapi ise saamaajik vigyaan ke anya vishyon ke samakaksh manyata nahin mili he
 It has so much happened that in developed countries, it is being taught as a completely autonomous subject in many universities
 bharat jaise vikasshil deshon main bhi sudhaar hua he
 Initially here 'indian School of International Relations, New Delhi' which later on autonomously functions as the School of International Relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University
 iske atirikt kai anya vishvavidhyalayon jaise jadavapur vishvavidhyalay, kalakatta, goa vishvavidhyalay aadi main bhi ab ise swytt vishay kaa darja mila he
 Before studying international relations as an autonomous subject, it is necessary to clarify one thing that when we study the question of autonomy of this subject, 'international politics' and international relations are not considered as separate subjects
 yah isliye kiya gaya he ki donon hi vishyon ko abhi swytt anushaasan na maanakar raajnneetishastra vishay ke ek up-anushaasan ke rup main hi manyata praapt he
 Secondly, the distinction is so subtle that this subject can be resolved after authenticating the autonomy of the discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko swytt vishay maanane ke sandarbh main teen pruthak-pruthak vichaar die gaye hai jo nimna prakaar se hai - According to scholars who consider this subject as autonomous, it should be considered as an autonomous subject given the content and discipline related content of international politics

 These scholars have certified it as an autonomous subject on the following grounds: jo vidwaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko ek swytt vishay nahin maanate unka maananaa yah he ki is vishay main aisi koi vilakshan vastu nahin he ki ise adhyayan hetu swytt mana jaae
 He has supported his point on the basis of the following arguments- kuch vidwaan uparyukt donon prakaar kii bahes ko nirarthak maanate hai
 They believe that both of the above arguments can be better understood through the development in international politics
 atah 20veen shatabdi main, or visheshkar 1945 ke baad, ke vikaas kii samiksha ati anivaary he
 If we study deeply the question of autonomy of international politics, then it is known that two fundamental problems have to be faced in this context
 ek to antarrashtriya sambandh ke swaroop, vishaywastu va adhyayan ke tareekon main prabhavi parivartan aaye hai
 Second, at the same time, the problem has increased further due to the complexities of political science and the development of undefined boundaries
 lekin 1919 se aaj tak ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas par nazar daalen to spasht hota he ki isaki uplabdhiyaan ise swaittata dilaane main kaaphi sahaayak siddh hongi
 Since 1919, especially in America, many scholars have tried to make this subject more and more scientific
 iske vishay vastu, tareekon evam siddhanth ko suspasht karne ke prayaas bhi hue hai
 These authors mainly include Paul, Rines, Bern, James Bright, Hubert, Givens, Raymond Wull, Parker, Moon, Shubhan, Alford Jimene, E

 Several scholars in America, mainly Maranthau, Richard Snyder, Martin Kaplan, Carl W
 Doyce, Charles mcclelland, have made specific contributions in this regard
 iske atirikt viksit va vikasshil donon deshon ke adhyayan par bal diya he
 The compilation of its subject matter, theory rendering and methods have also developed a lot

 Its importance in the post-cold War world has increased

 International and national issues like environment, terrorism, feminism, ADS, depletion of ozone layer, human rights etc
 have become associated with human / human beings rather than national
 atah aaj in sabake samaadhaan hetu antarrashtriya manchon / sanghathanon kii sakriy bhagidaari aavashyak he
 Now universal theory has also been rejected from the point of view of postmodernism and more emphasis has been given on subjective and local basis
 at 1945 ke baad ke vikaas ke aadhaar par ise swaittata kii ore agrasar kaha ja saktaa he, jise 1991 ke baad sheet yuddh ke ant kii prakriya ne or shashakt banane kii koshish kii he

 Thomas Howes was born in Momsbury
 91 varsh kii is dderghaayu main habs ne anek saamaajik raajnneetik viplav or parivartan dekhe-madhyamvarg kaa utthan, stuart raajaaon ore parlment kaa sangharsh, charles pratham kii phaansi, kramwel kaa shashan tathaa restauration, apni sahaj bhirutha ke kaaran habs shanti or suraksha ko atyadhik mahatv detaa tha
 England's civil war further reinforced his idea that mutual discord and war are fatal to civilized life
 yadhyapi parlment or raja ke jhagade main habs ne raja kaa paksh liya, tathaapi uske tark aisi kisi bhi satta kaa samarthan karte hai jo shanti evam vyavastha sthapit kar sake
 Hobbes's philosophy is inspired by the beliefs of scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, Decart and Gasendi
 kaha jaataa he ki sampurna maanavgyan ko ek sutara main baandhakar vaigyanik aadharshila par pratishthat karnaa hi uskaa uddeshy tha
 But what is the real connection between Hobbes's philosophy and the science of the day is controversial
 leo strous kaa mat he ki yadhyapi habs kaa chintan vaigyanik rup main prastut kiya gaya he, tathaapi uskaa strot clasical maanavvaad he, na ki aadhunik bhautikwaad
 Before the discovery of Galileo and Kepler, Hobbes had indelible effects on Thumididis and Aristotle
 gaikel ok shot ke anusaar habs ke darshan kii mul prerana vaigyanik bhautikwaad nahin, apitu darshanik buddhivaad-darshan ke swaroop ke vishay main ek vishesh dharna - he
 This notion considers science and philosophy as friends
 habs kaa darshan buddhi ke darpan main pratibimbit jagat he
 The world is seen mechanically by looking in this mirror, even if it is not really a machine
 isiilie maanav samaaj kaa bauddhik vivechan bhi use yantravat maanakar hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Hobbs is primarily a political thinker
 parantu uskaa rajshastra uske saamaanya darshan kaa ek ang he
 This philosophy is characterized by deductive system of geometry
 is pranali kii manyata buddhivaad he
 Hobbes's rationalism is different from the rationalism of Plato, St
 Thomas and Spinoza
 yah uttaramadhyayugin namawaadi parampara ke antargat he
 In Hobbs' philosophy, the place of wisdom is secondary, the predominance is of willpower and emotions
 buddhi ek kala athwa saadhan he jiske dwaara purvanishchit pratigyaaon se sahi nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai
 These vows are always optional
 at: darshanik gyaan kii duusari visheshta he uskaa kalpit swaroop
 Hobbs calls philosophy the cause-knowledge and considers Karan as the preceding motion
 sabhi gyaan gati kii vibhinnata se praapt hota he
 Thus, universal movement is the universal cause of all human knowledge
 jyamiti kaa sambandh binduon or rekhaon kii gati se he, bhautik jagat parmaanuon kii gati he; manovigyaan maanav sharir ke antargat snayuspandan kaa vivaran he tathaa rajya vyaktiyon ke parsparik aghat pratighaat se utpann sanshlisht gati kaa parinaam he
 Thus all the above scriptures study the same subject in various forms
 habs yah spasht nahin karata ki bhautik tathaa maanav jagat kii vyakhya kalpit pramayon par aadhaarit jyamiti kii nigamanaatmak pranali par kaise ho sakati he
 His logic does not establish any logical connection between his mechanical materialism and his materialism with his rationalism
 rajya ko uske moulik tatwon main vighatit karne par prakritik avasthaa praapt hoti he
 This stage is not a historical fact but a logical concept of anarchy
 bahya jagat main vyaapt gati ke pratighaat se maanav sharir main do prakaar kii gatiyaan utpann hoti hai- aakarshan or vikarshan
 At the psychological level, they are called will and rancor
 jo vastuen jeevanaraksha main sahaayak hoti hai, manushya unke prati aakrisht hota he or jinase jivan nasht hota he unase vah palaayan karata he
 Desired items are said to be auspicious and undesirable inauspicious
 chunki jivan kii raksha tathaa sanvruddhi karanevaali vastuen simit he or sabhi vyakti apni daihik tathaa maansik shaktiyon ko milakar lagbhag samaan hai, at: vaanchit vastuon kii prapti tathaa usko sanchit rakhane ke liye pratidwandvit prarambh hoti he jo sheeghra hi gaurav tathaa shakti ke liye sangharsh ke rup main parinat ho jaati he
 This struggle prevails only in death because Shaktilipsa is infinite
 usamen vivek evam maryaada ke liye koi sthaan nahin hota
 Always engaged in appeasement of unquenchable lusts, madness and the constant warfare of people who are suspicious of each other, result in the natural state of human life being isolated, trivial, hateful, bestial and transitory
 aisi paristhiti main sabhyataa, samskruti tathaa vyavsaay kaa sarvatha abhaav rahata he
 There is no question of justice injustice
 vyakti apni jeevanaraksha ke liye jo kuch kar saktaa he vahi uskaa prakritik adhikaar he
 Natural rights are limited only by natural power
 prakritik avasthaa manushya ke aseem abhimaan, swaarth tathaa aniyantrit bhavavesh kaa parinaam he
 But the wisdom to get rid of this dreadful situation also remains in it
 buddhi ke dwaara manushya prakritik niyamon kii khoj karata he jinase shanti kii vyavastha hoti he or jeevanarekha kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Natural law teaches that rivalry and violence are enemies of self-defense, that cooperation and peace are the real means
 at: prayek vyakti ko shanti foundne kaa praytn karnaa chahie
 If other people are also ready for this, then they should be ready to give up their unlimited natural rights and be satisfied with the same freedom as others are willing to give to others against them
 manushya ko apane kiye hue vaadon ke anukool aacharan karnaa chahie kyonki parsparik vishwaas or sanvida se hi samaaj kii sthapana kii ja sakati he
 Natural laws are necessary for the state, but Hobbs is unable to establish his harmony with his egoistic psychology
 yadi manushya buddhiyukt praani he to prakritik avasthaa kaa yah bhayanak chitra asaty he or yadi yah chitra vaastavik he to aise praaniyon se samaaj main rahane kii aashaa karnaa vyarth he
 Then natural law is moral law or just the rule of utility, it is not clear
 nihsandeh ishwar athwa samprabhu ke odash kaa rup dhaaran kar lene par ve naitik rup se baadhya karte hai
 But before joining the sovereign, their obligation is moral or intellectual only
 habs yah bhi kahata he ki shakti ke bina sanvida bekaar he
 Therefore, despite being morally and intellectually bound, one needs physical bond to obey the state
 sanvida ke dwaara prayek vyakti apane aseem prakritik adhikaron ko ek anya vyakti, yaa vyaktisamooh, ko sthanantarit kar detaa he jo sabaki shanti or suraksha ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 Being a part of Sambida, this person, or group of people, is not bound by any human law
 vah sabhi vyaktiyon kaa pratinidhi he
 Therefore, his opposition is self-contradiction
 usamen sannihit samprabhutaa avibhajya, aseem adey tathaa sthaayee he
 He is the sole owner of the church and other communities
 uske aadesh hi kanoon hai or jahaan kanoon maun he, vahiin janata swatantra he
 The person can only disobey the orders of the sovereign for self-defense
 sanvida ke atirikt rajya kii sthapana vijay ke dwaara bhi ho sakati he kintu donon main koi tathvik antar nahin he
 Hobbs is called the father of modern Rajadarshan
 bentham ke upyogetavaad tathaa austin ke samprabhutaa siddhant par uskaa prabhaav spasht he
 Although he supported autocratic sovereignty, individualism is the cornerstone of his philosophy
 samprabhu kii aseem adhikaar dete hue bhi vyakti ke jivan main rajya ke anaavashyak hastkshep ko vah avaanchhneeya maanata he
 Then, the basis of the individual's royalty is the sovereign's ability to provide security and peace
 yadi yah aisa nahin kar saktaa, to janata doosraa shaasha chunane ke liye swatantra he
 The sovereign does not have the divine right to rule

aspx saanchaa:victoria beckhamsazca:spice Girls The following persons are realized by Dharmaraja- khaataa-bahi yaa lager us mukhya bahi ko kehete hai jisamen paise ke len-dein kaa hisaab rakhaa jaataa he
 Nowadays it is also in the form of a computer-file
 khaataa bahi main sabhi len-dein ko khaataa ke anusaar likhaa jaataa he jisamen debit or credit ke ke do alag-alag kollam hote hai
 One objective of accounting is to easily determine what the trader has to give to his creditors, what he has to take from his debtors, his expenses and income etc
 yah bhi spasht he ki yah jaankaree keval rojnaama main saudon ke likhane maatr se hi turant praapt nahin ho sakati
 Suppose a person wants to know what to take or give from 'A', then he will have to see the entire scroll to find the entries related to 'A', because he has bought the goods from him many times and has given him money many times
 
 yadi yahi tarika apane saath vyavhaar karne vaale prayek vyakti yaa form ke saath apni sthiti maaloom karne ke liye prayog main laayaa jaay to vahi khate likhane kaa uddeshy antashah hi praapt hoga
 Apart from this, it will mean wasteful time, energy and money
 atah prayek vyakti athwa form se sambandhit sabhi pravishtiyon ko ek saath likhane ke liye koi twarit saadhan praapt karnaa chahie
 All this is done by collating and collating the entries in another book, called Khatabahi
 prayek vyakti se sambandhit un sabhi pravishtiyon ko jo ab tak rojnaama main vikhri padi thi ek jagah ekatrit evam sankshipt kiya jaataa he
 According to Batleboy, Khatabahi is the main book of accounts and in this book all the business transactions are divided in the end and get a place in their accounts
 picals ke anusaar, ‘khatabahi khaaton kii sabase mahatvapurn pusatak he or sahaayak pustakon main kii gai pravishtiyon kii manzil he
 It is essentially a collection of three types of accounts - real, personal and nominal
 uparyukt vivechan se yah puri tarah se spasht ho jaataa he ki khaataavhi pratham pravishti kii pustak nahin he kyonki koi bhi pravishti sidhi is prastak main nahin kii jaati he
 The entry is first made in the supporting books
 yah pramukh mahatva kii pusatak he
 In this, there are accounts related to all the transactions in the transaction
 yadhyapi aisa koi pakkaa niyam nahin he tathaapi saadharantaya khatabahi ke ek prishth main ek hi khaataa hota he
 This is done to remove impurities and clumsiness of the entire handwriting
 yadi khaaton kii sankhya bahut adhik ho to ek hi khatabahi main sab khaaton ko rakhana sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 In such a situation the book is divided into several departments or results
 udhaaharan ke liye rokad bahi khatabahi kaa hi ek upavibhaajan hai
 Cash deals are written in it
 khatabahi ko vibhajit karne kaa ek-tarika use vyaktig or avyaktigat yaa saadhaaran khatabahi main vibhajit karnaa he
 The individual ledger can be further subdivided into the ledger ledger account
 isi prakaar se khatabahi ko bhi vaastavik khatabahi or naam maatr khatabahi main upavibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes a personal account is maintained to maintain a capital account and a withdrawal account
 parantu company main aisi koi khatabahi nahin rakhi jaati he
 It should be noted that the above method is not the only one to subdivide the account
 vibhajit karne kii vidhiyaan prayek ke ke halaat par nirbhar karti he
 Each account is suggestive at the beginning
 saamanyata yah varnatmak abhisuchak hota he
 a page of the suffixer is assigned to a letter in the alphabet and the names that begin with it are written on the page assigned to that letter
 abhisuchak main prayek khate ke saamne khatabahi ke us prishth kii sankhya likh di jaati he jis par vah khaataa kholaa gaya he
 Many forms of ledger are found in business
 sarvasaamaanya praaroop main tithi, saude kaa vivaran, prishthank or dhanrashi ke liye stambh hote hai
 Additional cubic columns can be added to suit business needs
 praaroop kaa ek vaikalpik rup, jise bainko or kuch vyavsaayik sansthaaon me apaana jaataa he, vah he jiske khatabahi ke puure prishth ko chah stambhon main baant diya jaataa he
 These columns are - is vaikalpik praaroop kaa laabh yah he ki prayek saude ke uparant khate kaa shesh apane aap nikaala ja saktaa he shesh gyaat karne ke liye varsh kii samaapti tak pratiksha nahin kerani padati hai
 The process of making entries in the ledger from the booklet and other supporting books is called Khatauni
 rojnaama evam anya sahaayak pustakon main di gai pravishtiyon ke liye aadhaar banaati he
 Khatauni work does not require special skill as it is a normal type of work
 pravishtiyon ke rojnaama main likhane ke pashchaat khatabahi main khataya janaa chahie
 It is easier than the lettering of the journalists than the letter of the other supporting books
 rojnaama ke debit paksh ke dhan-raashi stambh main likhi gai dhanrashi ko khatabahi main sambandhit khate ke credit paksh me khataya jaataa he or credit paksh ke dhan-raashi stambh main likhi gai dhanrashi ko khatabahi main sambandhit khate ke credit paksh main khataya jaataa he
 Names of accounts are exchanged in the statement column of the ledger - the name of the account in which the money is debited
 khatabahi main duusare khate ke credit paksh ke vivaran stambh main likhaa jayega
 Similarly, the opposite is also true
 yah nimnlikhit udhaaharan dwaara samajha ja saktaa he
 a separate account of each creditor is opened in the ledger
 prayek kray kii dhan-raashi usase sambandhit vyaktigat khate main saadharantaya pratidin credit kii jaaegi
 The double-entry of this book will be completed by debiting the purchase account of the total purchases over a periodic sum
 khaataa pustak main prayek dendar kaa ek alag khaataa kholana hoga
 Generally, credit sales are maintained daily in individual accounts
 graahakon ke vaiyakti khate ko vikray kii dhanrashi se debit kiya jayega
 The sales account will be credited with the monthly sum of credit sales
 is prakaar is pustak kii dwi-pravishti purna kii jaaegi
 In Khatabhi every person to whom the goods have been returned is debited and at the end of the month the periodical sum of the returns is credited to the purchase return account in the ledger
 us prayek graahak ko jo maal lautaata he, credit kiya jaataa he or maheene ke ant main vikray-vaapasi pustak ke yoga ke vikray-vaapasi khate ko debit kiya jaataa he
 All the cash items are consumed in the ledger in the ledger
 rokad bahi ke debit paksh main likhi sabhi praptiyon ko sambandhit khaaton ke credit main ‘rokad se’, bank se’, ‘chhot se’ likhakar khataya jaataa he
 All payments written on the credit side of the cash book are debited to the respective accounts debit by writing 'from cash', 'with discount', from bank '
 rokad bahi ke debit paksh ke chhot satmbh ke yoga ko khatabahi main chhot khate ke debit paksh main likhaa jaataa he
 Because items are sourced on the credit side of individual accounts
 madon ko vyaktigat khaaton ke debit main khatai jane kii vajah se rokad bahi ke credit paksh ke chhot stambh ke yoga ko khatabahi main chhot khate ke credit paksh main likhaa jaataa he
 The account of the person from whom the exchange is received is credited with the money amount of the bill
 praapt vipatron ke masik yoga se khatabahi main prapya-vinimay-vipatr khaataa debit kiya jaataa he
 The account of the person to whom the bill is given is debited from the money amount of the bill
 dey vipatron ke masik yoga se khatabahi main dey vinimay vipatr khate ko credit kiya jaataa he
 a general entry is made to the analysis of retail expenditures indicated by the analytical columns of the retail cash book at periodic intervals
 prayek naam maatr ke khate ko uske sambindh yoga se debit kiya jaataa he or khudara rokad khaat avadhi main kiye gaye kul khudara vyayon kii se credit kiya jaat he
 In order to find out what to take from a particular person or what to give to a particular person, it is necessary to extract the balance of his personal account
 is prakriya ko khate band karnaa kehete hai
 To remove the balance of an account, the sum of both its sides is applied
 yadi donon paksh baraabar nahin hote, to donon pakshon ko baraabar karne ke liye antar kii kami vaale paksh main likh diya jaataa he
 The difference obtained in this way for writing on the deficient side is called the balance of that account
 yadi debit paksh kaa yoga credit paksh ke yoga se adhik he to shesh ko shthal thansandbam badhakashlikh kar credit paksh likh diya jaataa he
 In such case, that balance is called debit balance
 duusare varsh ke armbh main is shesh ko khaataa kholane samay shthal insandbam idhakashlikh kar debit paksh main likh diya jaataa he
 Similarly, if the sum of the credit side is more than the sum of the debit side, then the balance is written on the credit side by writing the latest insubam
 is shesh ko credit shesh kaahaa jaataa he
 Real accounts represent the assets of the business
 is khaaton ke shesh chitthey kii tithi par vyapaar ke adhikaar vaali sampattiyon kii dhan-raashi gyaat karne ke liye nikaale jate hai
 Their balance is also extracted in the same way
 jis prakaar vyaktigat khaaton kaa shesh nikaala jaataa he
 It should be noted that the balance of real accounts is always debited or no balance, ie their balance can never be a credit balance
 naam maatr khate vyapaar ke vyayon, haniyon aayon tathaa laabhon se sambandh rakhte hai
 Their balance is not removed
 vastutah inhen vyapaar khate athwa laabh-haani khate main sthaanantarit karke band kar diya jaataa he
 Comment khaaton kaa shesh nikaalte hue yaa usko band karte samay yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki donon pakshon kaa jod ek sidh main likhaa jaae
 If there is only one entry in the accounts then it is necessary to add
 pravishti ke neeche khichi dohari rekha kaa taatpary yah hoga ki vah pravishti hi swayan kaa jod he
 Similarly, if there is one entry on each side of the account with the same amount of money, then it would be unnecessary to add
 nodak yaa propeller aise yantra yaa mashin ko kehete hai jo kisi vaahan par laga ho or use aage dhakelne kaa kaam kare
 The rotation of propellants helps to throw air or water backward, which forces the vehicle forward
 samudri jahaazon or vayuyanon par lage pankhenuma nodak jal yaa hawa ko peeche phenkakar yaan ko aage kii taraf dhakelte hai
 The word prophet may refer to the following: is tarah tarabine water wheel kii prakritik rup se viksit takanic he
 However, the modern turbine did not develop until the Industrial Revolution took place
 aitihaasik taur par dekhen to 19veen sadi main yah badi-badi factoriyon main istemaal hota tha
 But, when electricity was generated, generators started being used in factories
 Now, if we talk about the working of turbine, it works on the basis of Newton's third law of motion
 yani prayek kriya par, vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This is how the propeller of the turbine works
 propeller main laga spindal hawa yaa pani par dabaav banaata he
 This pressure causes the propeller to push the turbine backwards, causing it to move
 aamtaur par tarabine ko ek jagah rakh diya jaataa he, taaki jab bhi pani usase hokar guzare to tarabine ke har blade par padane vaale dabaav se vah chal pade
 The same rule applies with wind or water turbines
 jitna adhik pani yaa hawa kaa pravaah hoga, tarabine utani tej gati se chalegi

 shuruyaat main murphi ko ek "stritegic guest star" ke rup main shrey diya gaya tha, lekin iske mul sanskaran ko darshakon dwaara pasand na kiye jane ke baad unhen bhi isamen shaamil kar liya gaya

 As Murphy's childhood friend Harris Heath wrote in his book Growing Up Laughing with Eddie, long before Murphy wrote Cumming to America, Art Buchwald went to Paramount Pictures with the idea of one such film
 uski saamagree ko asweekaar kar diya gaya tha, lekin paramount dwaara is jaankaree ko banaae rakhaa gaya tha
 He liked the idea of buchwald but did not think it appropriate to give him the money and kept the material safe for future use
 kuch saal baad paramount ne kaming tu america ke vichaar ko edi ke samaksh prastut karte hue contract usee ko de diya
 Murphy wrote a screenplay that was shown on the big screen in exactly the same way

 Murphy's films started beating at the box office from 1989 to the mid-1990s and again from the mid-2000s; Critically criticized the Beverly Hills Cop III was the lowest point of the period, and the film was eventually condemned by Murphy on Inside the Actors Studio, although The Distinguished Gentleman, Boomerang, Another 48 Hours and Vampire Inn She also had some success at the box office with films like Brooklyn

 Economic growth is the growth of economic prosperity of countries, regions or individuals
 niti nirmaan kii drushti se aarthik vikaas un sabhi prayatnon ko kehete hai jinka lakshya kisi jan-samudaay kii aarthik sthiti va jivan-str ke sudhaar ke liye apanaaye jate hai
 The most important problem of the present era is the problem of 'economic development'
 aarthik swatantrata ke bina rajnatik swatantrata kaa koi mahatv nahin he
 Due to this importance of development and related issues, a different topic called development-economics emerged in the field of economics
 kintu pichley kuch varshon se vikaas-arthshaastra ke ek swatantra vishay ke rup main astitv par prashn chihn-sa ubharta dikhaai de rahaa he
 There are many economists who have denied the need for a separate subject called "development-economics", the main ones being - Slutz, Haberler, Barr, Little, Walters etc
 arthshaastriyon kaa ek varg "vikaas-arthshaastra" ko hi samaapt kar dene kii maang karne laga he
 Some economists have given different definitions of 'economic development', 'economic progress' and long-term change
 kintu mir or boldwin ne in teenon shbd-samoohon kaa ek hi arth main prayog kiya he tathaa alag-alag arth nikaalane ko 'bal kii khaal nikaalnaa' kaha he
 According to him, vikaas ke arth or maap ko lekar arthshaastra main ek bahes or vivaad chalaa aa rahaa he
 But despite such a long debate, the meaning of development is not clear
 jab koi arthshaastri vikaas ke bare main apana mantavya prakat karnaa chaahe to vah vikaas kaa arth bataata he evam uski paribhaasha detaa he
 But after some time he himself appears dissatisfied with his definition
 vah mahasoos karata he ki vah jo kuch chahta tha, vah kah nahin paa rahaa he, vah jahaan janaa chahta tha, ja nahin paa rahaa he
 It is a strange situation that without explaining the meaning of development, development plans, development models, development policy and strategies are being prepared and many kinds of activities are going on in every country in the name of development
 yah ek aisi hi sthiti hui jaise kisi vyakti ko jis sthaan par janaa ho use us sthaan kaa naam or disha hi spasht na ho, kintu phir bhi vah chal pade
 Economical prosperity or economic development? - Which of these two terms to use - Economists are also confused about this
 saadhaaran bolchaal kii bhashaa main to aarthik samruddhi or aarthik vikaas in donon shabdon kaa ek hi arth main prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 But first, Prof
 In an article titled "theory of Economic Development" published in 1911, Schumpeter explained the difference between the concepts of economic prosperity and economic development
 uske baad se anek arthshaastriyon ne in avadharanaon main antar bataaya he
 Pro
 According to Kinderberger, economic prosperity means more production, while economic growth involves both - more productive and changes in technical and institutional arrangements
 is prakaar aarthik samruddhi kii tulana main aarthik vikaas ek vistrut avadharana he
 Most economists have defined prosperity and development in the same sense from a practical point of view, even though technically considering differences in perceptions of prosperity and development
 ve vikaas ko 'aay main vruddhi' or 'utpaadan vruddhi' se aage kii cheez maanate hue bhi use aay or utpaadan vruddhi ke rup main hi paribhaashit karte hai
 Not only considering development as an increase in GDP per capita, they also divide the per capita GDP between developed, developing and underdeveloped countries of the world
 On the basis of yah vidmbana hi he ki ek ore ve kehete hai ki vikaas yah nahin he kintu duusari ore jo nahin he usee ko vikaas sweekaar kar lete hai
 In the economics of development, there is a lot of controversy and confusion about the measure and indicators of development, even more than the meaning and definition of development
 yah bhi kah sakate hai ki vikaas ke maap yaa suchakon ke vivaad main se hi vikaas kaa arth va paribhaasha kaa vivaad utpann hua he
 The question is, can development be measured numerically? Western economics has assumed that growth can be measured numerically
 yah maan lene ke baad doosraa sawaal yah utpann hota he ki vikaas ko kaise or kin maapdandon se mapa ja saktaa he ki kisi desh kaa vikaas hua he yaa nahin or kitna hua he
 Several indicators have been suggested to measure development from time to time
 vikaas ke vibhinn suchakon ko ham mukhyat: do bhaagon main vargeekrut kar sakate hai- aarthik suchak evam gaiyr-aarthik suchak
 Some economists like Kuznets, Mayer and Baldwin, Mead etc
 It is considered the best indicator of development
 unke anusaar vaastavik ji
di
pi
 main vruddhi dar ke aadhaar par ham vikaas kii dar ko maap sakate hai
 To some extent, G
D
P
 Despite being a useful criterion for development, it cannot be considered an appropriate criterion
 isaki pramukh kamiyaan is prakaar hai- Most economists use real GDP per capita
 Development is considered to be the best, practical and convenient criterion for development
 kindolbarger, meyar, higins, harvey lebenstin, dablyoo
e
 levis, jacob winer aadi arthshaastri isi mat ke hai
 The United Nations has also accepted this measure
 prati vyakti ji

 ko vikaas kaa maapdand sweekaar kar lene par jansankhya kii vruddhi ke prabhaav kaa bhi vichaar ho jaataa he, kyonki kul ji
di
pi
 main kul jansankhya kaa bhaag dene par hi prati vyakti ji
di
pi
 kii gananaa hoti he
 But GDP per capita as a yardstick for development
 There is also an incomplete criterion and it also has many faults
 inamen se pramukh hai- In essence, G
D
P
 And GDP per capita There are some drawbacks of being accepted as criteria for development which are as follows: kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki vikaas kaa antim lakshya logon ke rahan-sahan va jivan str main vruddhi karnaa hota he or rahan-sahan kaa str upbhog ke liye uplabdh vastuon va sevaaon kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, the level of per capita consumption is the best criterion for economic development
 kintu is maap kii bhi apni ek kathinaayee he
 Every country needs capital accumulation and savings to produce more in the future and for this consumption has to be reduced
 yadi koi desh apane upbhog ko kam karke bachat va puunji nirmaan main vruddhi kar rahaa hoga to prati vyakti upbhog str ko vikaas kaa maapdand maan lene par us desh kaa aarthik vikaas nahin mana jayega
 On the other hand, if a country currently increases its consumption level significantly but reduces its savings and capital formation, then it will create the possibility of decreasing its total production in future
 kintu prati vyakti upbhog str ke maapdand ke anusaar us desh kaa aarthik vikaas hua he, yah kaha jayega
 According to some scholars, economic welfare may be the best criterion for economic development
 aarthik kalyaan kaa vichaar karte samay ham keval yah nahin dekhenge ki kya or kitna utpaadan kiya ja rahaa he, balki iske antargat yah bhi dekhenge ki yah kis prakaar paidaa kiya ja rahaa he or iskaa bantwaaraa kis prakaar ho rahaa he
 In economic welfare, it should also be kept in mind that what is the comparative importance of the goods which are being produced in the country? Thus, we have to make fundamental decisions in this
 isi tarah utpaadan kii saamaajik laagat kaa bhi vichaar karnaa hoga
 Although the criterion of economic welfare is more suitable for development, yet economists have not yet used it in practice
 iskaa kaaran unhone yah bataaya he ki moolyaatmak nirnyon, nyaaypurna vitaran, saamaajik laagat aadi aisi baaten hai jinaki vyavhaar main gananaa karnaa bahut kathin he, at: aarthik kalyaan ko avyaavhaarik maanakar chhod diya gaya he
 In order to facilitate comparative studies between different countries, some economists have suggested accepting the adjusted GDP as a criterion for development
 is maap ke madhyam se rashtriya aay ke lekhon ko samyojit karne ke liye krayshakti samta kii avadharana kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 But even in this criterion, the measurement of national income has all the limitations, besides, adjusting the national income is not a simple task, it has its own difficulties and limitations
 uparyukt maapdandon ke alaava kuch vidwaanon ne vikaas ke or bhi kai maapdandon ke prayog kaa suzav diya he
 For example, a lower percentage of poor people in the total population may be a good criterion for economic development
 par ye sabhi maapdand ekapaksheeya hai
 Social indicators are stated as basic needs of man
 mukhya saamaajik suchakon main ye shaamil hai- jivan pratyaasha, calori-paan, shishu mrityu dar, vidyalayon main praathmik kakshaon main bhartee sankhya, awaas, poshan, swasthya tathaa aisi hi anya ve sab chijen jo manushya kii moolbhoot aavashyaktaaon se sambandh rakhti hai
 This system was given by Stone and Sears
 isi kram main pieatt evam round ne bhi soshal accounting matrix ke naam se ek suchak diya tha
 But the biggest drawback of this type of system is the lack of reliable and useful data
 iske alaava isamen saamaajik vikaas ke sab pahaluon ko sammilit kar paanaa bhi kathin rahata he
 This indicator was developed by the United Nations Research Institute on Social Development
 prarambh main 73 suchakon ko jaancha gaya jinamein se ant main 16 suchakon kaa chayan kiya gaya
 These indicators are- uparokt suchakon ko dekhne se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki ye bhi vikaas ke upyukt maapdand nahin ban sakate
 This indicator of development was given by Morris D
 Morris in 1979
 iske antargat teen suchakon kaa prayog karne kii baat kahi gai thi- This indicator is also incomplete
 kyonki isamen anek saamaajik evam manovaigyanik suchakon ko shaamil hi nahin kiya gaya he- jaise suraksha, nyaay, maanav adhikaar aadi

 Ask who was on the banks of the river when these people started to spend their old age on the day that when it was a long day, then the fish would come up in front of them on the water
 Fast and when they did not have a long day, the fishermen would not go near them and because these people were ill-treated, we used to try them in the same way and when one of them said that those who have to give themselves a good shove or in hard work Why did Mubtila want to persuade them, then she started saying that to save your family from accusations, so that these people will abstain from abstinence When those people forgot what they had been taught, then we have given them experience Gave those who stopped people from evil deeds, and those who were oppressed, they were arrested in great wonder because of their bad behavior, then the thing that was supposed to be done when those people tried in it, then we ordered that you district And become a rotten monkey when your family calls out to you, not only that your family is going to be amazing very soon and it's also not that big There is also a shocker and we scattered them in a gang of rupees, some of them are noble and others are different and we tried them with joy and sorrow so that they came to hawk and then they got some life after that which book If you become a heir, the nefarious bastard takes away the goods of the world and says that we will be left unaccounted for if we also take the same with him

Did they create the rule of heaven and land and God? i did not look into things nor in the matter of whether his death has come close, then after convincing so much, what will you believe in, which will leave you in a tizzy then No Rahbr and will leave them to Srksi that Srgrdaॅ keep you guys vah saare aasmaan va zamin main ek kathin vaqt hoga vah tumhaare paas pas achaanak aa jaaegi tumse log is tarah poochhate hai goyaa tum unase bakhubi vaaqif ho tum kah do ki uskaa ilm bas khuda hi ko he magar bahuterey log nahin jaanate tum kah do ki mai khud apana aap to ekatiyaar rakhata hi nahin na nafe kaa na zarar kaa magar bas vahi khuda jo chaahe or agar gaib ko jaanata hota to yaqinan mai apana bahut sa faaydaa kar letaa or mujhe kabhi koi takaleef bhi na pahunchati mai to sirf eemaandaaron ko And it is God who gives you the good news of violence, who created you from a person and made a pair of it from the rest of the soil, so that when the person rests with his wife, Bibi is lightly Hamal gets attacked, then walks with him, then when he starts praying to his family God that if we get a good Farzand ata, we will surely be yours Then, when God gave them a good attitude, then what God had told them was so much better than God, is it so much better than God, do those people make such things as God who cannot produce anything but that? You are born yourself and do not want to help them and neither can you help yourself, and even if you call them for instruction, then you will not give your support Are equal respect Khwah you Beshk they call or you sit quietly he People, whom you halt except yourself, are bound like you, but if you call them, then if you are truthful, then they should listen to you

 Close captives drag them to the missing person and then do nothing and when you do not bring any chance to them, they say why you did not Neither did you say that i am only the one who comes to me from my family, these are the arguments from your family and it is instructive and compassionate for honest people when listening to the Quran, listen with ear And be quiet so that you may have pity and remember your family in your own life in the morning with the voice of gagging and fear and not much screaming and the Gafil Bill Do not be dejected, the people who are possessed by your God and that is his sure araaf khatm 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666767686970717273747576777879808182811101011101011101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101029101010291010101029101029101029101010101029101010291010109109101091041091010910910910910910429529529575575575575590530575575975938,

 sharad poornima ko chandramaa, karthik dwadashi ko kamdhenu gaay, trayodashi ko dhanvantari, chaturdashi ko kaali mata or amavasya ko bhagwati lakshmi ji kaa sagar se pradurbhaav hua tha
 That is why two days before Deepawali, Dhanteras is celebrated as the birth of Lord Dhanwantari as Dhanteras
 isi din inhone ayurveda kaa bhi pradurbhaav kiya tha
 He is called the form of Lord Vishnu who has four arms
 upar kii donon bhujaaon main shankh or chakra dhaaran kiye huye hai
 While in one of the two other arms, one has water and medicine and the other has nectar urn
 inkaa priy dhaatu pital mana jaataa he
 Therefore, there is also a tradition of buying brass utensils for Dhanteras

 It was he who discovered amritamay medicines
 inke vansh main divodas hue jinhone 'shalya chikitsa' kaa vishwa kaa pehla vidhyalay kaashi main sthapit kiya jiske pradhanacharya sushrut banaaye gaye the

 Sushruta was the first surgeon in the world
 deepawali ke avasar par karthik trayodashi-dhanteras ko bhagwaan dhanvantari kii puja karte hai
 It is said that Shankar took poison, Dhanvantari provided nectar and thus Kashi became a city of classics
 ayurveda ke sambandh main sushrut kaa mat he ki brahmaji ne pehali baar ek lakh shloke ke, ayurveda kaa prakaashan kiya tha jisamen ek sahasr adhyay the

 There is no mention of Dhanvantari anywhere in the Veda Samhita and Brahmin section
 mahabharat tathaa puraanon main vishnu ke ansh ke rup main unka ullekh praapt hota he
 They originated as eggs from the urn produced after Samudramanthan
 samudr ke nikalne ke baad unhone bhagwaan vishnu se kaha ki lok main meraa sthaan or bhaag nishchit kar den

 The tradition of Dhanvantari is as follows - yah vansh-parampara harivansh puraana ke aakhyaan ke anusaar he
 In Vishnupuran it is slightly different- vaidic kaal main jo mahatv or sthaan ashvini ko praapt tha vahi puranic kaal main dhanvantari ko praapt hua
 Where Ashwini had Madhukalash in her hand, Dhanvantari got the nectar Kalash, because Vishnu protects the world, so Dhanvantari, who protects from diseases, was considered a part of Vishnu
 vishavidya ke sambandh main kashyap or takshak kaa jo samvaad mahabharat main aayaa he, vaisaa hi dhanvantari or nagdevi mansa kaa brahmavaivart puraana main aayaa he
 He has been called a disciple of Garuda - bhagavan dhanvantari kii sadhana ke liye ek saadhaaran mantra he: Apart from this, he also has another mantra: prachli dhanvantari stotra is prakaar se he

 While such behavior is considered inappropriate and inappropriate, the term is associated with the behavior of children or childish behavior in front of their relatives in a blasphemous or negative manner
 yah vyavhaar praayah dusron se vaidhata paane ke liye swayan ko charchaa main banaae rakhane kii laalasaa main aatmshlagha ko prashray detaa he
 In some situations, the pleasure of calling attention to others is socially acceptable
 yadi bachapan main kisi ko apane mata-pita athwa bado se adhik dhyaan nahin mila ho to vah swayan ko upekshit mahasoos karte hue bada ho saktaa he
 Then that realization will be the main carrier of the person's attentive behavior

 In India too, bicycle wheels played an important role in economic growth
 1947 main aazaadee ke baad agle kai dashak tak desh main cycle yatayaat vyavastha kaa anivaary hissaa rahi
 Especially from 1960 to 1990, most families in India had bicycles
 yah vyaktigat yatayaat kaa sabase taqatvar or kifayati saadhan tha
 In villages, farmers used to take vegetables and other crops on cycles only till weekly mandis
 doodh kii supplai gaanvon se paas se kasbaai bazaaron tak cycle ke jariye hi hoti thi
 The entire system of the postal department used to run on a cycle
 aaj bhi postman cycle se chitthiyaan baantate hai
 Age changed and courier services became more reliable, but the importance of bicycle did not end here
 badi sankhya main courier baantne vaale bhi cycle kaa istemaal karte hai
 Liberalization began in the country in 1990 and a series of rapid economic changes began
 desh kii yuva peedi ko motorcycle kii sawari zyada bha rahi thi
 In the license permit raj, the patience of those who waited years for a scooter was exhausted
 udaarikaran ke kuch saal baad shahari madhyavarg ko apane shauk puure karne ke liye paisa kharch karne main hichak nahin thi
 The hobby of motorcycle was increasing in cities
 gaanvon main bhi is maamle main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho chuki thi
 Ambassadors, Bullets and Bajaj Group scooters were lagging behind in New India
 hero honda desh kii nai dhadkan ban rahi thi
 This change intensified in the coming years
 desh main badlaav ke donon pahiye badal gaye the
 Despite this, the importance of cycling in India is not over
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki china ke baad duniya main aaj bhi sabase zyada cycle bharat main banati hai
 Since the nineties, there has been a significant change in the statistics of sales of bicycles
 cykilon kii kul bikri main badhotaree ai he, lekin gramin ilaakon main isaki bikri main giravat ai he
 Due to easy economic sponsorship, people are giving more preference to motorcycles in these areas
 darasal, 1990 se pehle jo bhoomika cycle kii thi, uski jagah gaanvon or shaharon main motorcycle ne le lee
 The sales of two-wheelers in 2002-03, which was 48
12 lakh, increased to 74
37 lakh in 2008-09
 iskaa matlab yah he ki pichley kaarobaari saal main desh main jitani cycle bikin, utani hi bikri dopahiyon kii bhi rahi
 The following are the different parts of bicycle: bisikil kaa sabase mahatvapurn ang uskaa frem he
 The structure of the frame should be such that the parts mounted on it can do their work efficiently
 bisikil kii tikoni frem or aage tathaa peeche ke chimate khokhli, gol naliyon se banaae jate hai
 They are then stuck to the corners of the frame by holding them in appropriate brackets
 tikoni frem ke banane main dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki uski naliyon kii madhya rekhaayen ek hi samtal main rahen
 The front steering end of the frame, the handle stalk, and the front lines of the front tongs should coincide
 donon taru ke chimaton kii bhujaayen bhi unki madhya rekha se samamit tathaa samaantar honi chahie
 The mid-line of the wheels should coincide with the mid-line of the tongs, otherwise the bike will not be able to remain straight while remaining balanced
 pahiyon main aajkal naabhi kii sparsheey disha main are lagane kaa rivaaj he
 Tactile arrears, deceptive forces can be well applied to the wheel circle
 prayek do asann are kaichinuma lagakar, hub kii flaj se sparsheey disha main jhuke rahete hai
 The rear wheel takes 40 and the next 32 holes, so accordingly holes are made in its circles and half the number of holes are made in each flange of the hubs
 chakkaa taiyaar karte samay vyasabhimukh aath aron ko pehle lagaakar sahi kar lete hai, phir shesh aron ko usee kram se bharte jate hai
 In the pictures, the flanges on the left side of the hub are shown with the arrows, which are seated in odd numbered holes on the circle
 sam sankhyankit chhedon main dahini taraf kii flanz ke are baithenge, at: unke sthanon ko khaali dikhaaya gaya he
 Are made of wire are always called tans because of being in a state of tension
 prayog karte samay bhi pahiyon ke aron kii samay samay par pariksha karte rahanaa chahie, koi ara dhilaa or koi adhik tanaav main nahin hona chahie
 If everyone is seen playing with a finger, a sound should be emitted from them, otherwise the wheels will start to get broken after breaking
 unhen kasne kaa kaam ghere par lagi nipalon ko uchit disha main ghumaakar kiya ja saktaa he
 For a bicycle to work properly, it is necessary to pay attention to its ball bearings
 yadi kisi bering main se zaraa bhi awaz nikalati ho to avashya hi usamen koi kharabi he
 Open it and count the pills on both sides, wipe it with a cloth and brighten it
 yadi koi goli tuuti, chatkhi yaa ghis gai ho to use badal dijie, phir uski katori ke valayakaar khaanche tathaa konon ko dekhie
 They should not be worn, cut, or rough
 yadi kharaab hon, to unhen bhi badal dijie
 If there is no AB above and the pills are also of the same number and the same size, then the lack of oil in it should be understood
 bering ke kisi bhi bhaag main kisi bhi prakaar kaa kachra yaa keechad to hona hi nahin chahie
 It is fitted in the rear wheel, by which the rider can change the ratio of the speed of the bicycle to his will and need
 aajkal teen chaal denevaale giar habon kaa adhik prachaar he
 Such a gear navel is also made that the rear, ie inverted, brakes the paddle
 chaal badalane ke liye zanjeer chakra or naabhi ke bich kii chaal ke anupaat ko, naabhi kii dhuree ke madhya lagi baarik kadiyonwali ek zanjeer ko khinchakar badal diya jaataa he
 Pulling it changes the position of the gears inside the navel
 zanjeer ko khinchne kaa kaam to savaar apane liveron dwaara jor lagaakar karata he, lekin waapas lautne kii kriya naabhi ke bheetar lagi kamaani dwaara swat: hi ho jaati he
 To open the umbilical part, one should first open the left hand cone, then open the ring of bullets on the right hand side
 peeche ke chakke par iske laga dene se savaar jab chaahe pair chalaanaa band kar saktaa he, phir bhi vah pahiyaa aazaadee se ghumta rah saktaa he
 It is of two types, one with friction cylinder and the other with ratchet tooth
 prayek mukt chakra main yah gun hona chahie ki bhitari purjon ke atak jane se pedal kii zanjeer par khinchaav na paidaa ho or dubaara jab pedal chalaae jaaen tab bhitari purje ek dam aapas main jutakar kaam karne lagen or phisalein nahin
 Also, the texture of the wheel should be impervious to dust and water
 aajkal ratchet daant yukt mukt chakra kaa hi adhik prachlan he
 On the inner periphery of its enclosure, ratchet teeth are severed, wherein the dogs stuck in place, through a chain of paddles, convey the stretch given by the rider to the navel of the wheel
 pedal chalaanaa band hote hi zanjeer thahar jaati he tathaa ve kute kamaani ke jor se rechat ke daanton main baari baari se girte hai, jisase "katkat" kii aawaaj hoti he
 If the free cycle starts slipping, or gets jammed when running again, the first trick to correct it is to fill the wheel empty with plenty of kerosene, and when all that oil is gone, then give lubricating oil to it
 yadi aib dur na ho, to chakra ke dhakkan ko khol kar dekhnaa chahie ki kahin kute ghis to nahin gaye hai, athwa unki kamaniyaan hi tut gai hon
 Then it should be cleaned completely from within and replacing the broken parts or tablets with new ones, the bangles of the lid should be tightened carefully
 tair ko pahie ke ghere par jamaaye rakhane ke liye iske donon kinaaron par yaa to ispaat ke tarayukt, athwa rabar kii hi kathor gonth bana di jaati he, jo chakke ke ghere ke mude hue kinare ke neeche dabakar ataki rahati he or bhitari rabar nalee main hawa bhar dene se tair tanakar yathasthaan baith jaataa he
 The inner hose should be filled with the same pressure so that the tires bear the burden of the rider and the wheels do not hit the road pebbles, otherwise there will be a fear of the hose being crushed and tires broken
 aavashyaktaa se adhik hawa bhar dene se tair kaa lacheelaapan kam hokar bisical sadak par uchhalati hui chalati he, lekin aavashyak maatra main kasakar hawa bhar dene se pahie kaa vyas apni seemaa tak bad jaataa he or acchhee sadak par chalate samay pedal se kam maatra main shakti lagaani padati he
 Bud's air wall is often used to fill the air in the inner tube, the design of which is clearly shown in Fig
 13
 rabar kaa valb tub fata, kuchlaa or sada galaa nahin hona chahie
 The cap on the upper end of the hair plug should always be on
 balve kaa aadhaar nat ghere par sakhti se ksaa rahanaa chahie
 The plug of the valve, including the rubber valve tube, should enter into the grooves without interruption
 pedal craikon ko unki dhuree se cotteron dwaara hi joda jaataa he
 If the crack or axle becomes bent due to bicyclic fall, or accident, the cotter should be removed to dislodge the cranks, by opening the cotter nut attached to it, by hammering the churid end of the cater with a hammer, but attention
 Be careful not to spoil the bangles
 crank ke vaksh ke neeche lohe kii koi laag lagaakar hi cotter thonknaa chahie, anyathaa crank dhuree yaa ball bering par jhatka pahunchega
 If the two cranks are not in a straight line due to a malfunction, the flattened portion of the cotter should be sanded, or overturned
 yadi crank apni dhuree par dhilaa ho, to cotter ko adhik gaharaai tak thokane se bhi kaam ban jaataa he
 For a long time, both the cotter and the crank hole are cut and the axis of the spindle also gets damaged due to running the bicycle with loose couture
 at: nayaa cotter badalanaa hi acha rahata he
 Often the paddle pin is curved as a bicycle falls
 aisi haalat main pedal ke baahar kii taraf vaale vering kii topi utarkar uskaa samanjak cone nikaalkar goliyaan haath main le leni chahie
 Then the frame of the paddle should be moved and the inner wiring tablets should be taken and the paddlepin will remain in the crank
 uskaa nirikshan kar tathaa guniyaan main sidhaa kar, pedal ko yathapurv band dena chahie
 It is made by chained small petal links, cylinders and rivets
 ise saaf kar, tel kii chiknayee dekar or uske khinchaav ko sanmajit kar thik haalat main rakhana chahie
 The loosening of the chain's reverse joints and wear of the cylinders increases its overall length
 pedal ke dantachakr ke daanton kaa pich to badalata nahin, at: zanjeer chakra se utar kar takalif detii he
 The idea is that in the middle of the tangent of the chain mounted on the letter, it is pulled outward with a thumb and index finger
 yadi zanjeer lagbhag inch hi khinchati he, tab to thik he or yadi inch tak khinch jaati he to avashya hi ghiskar dhili ho gai hogi
 Therefore, it should be changed
 pahiyon ke gheron par dabaav daalanevaale hastchalit brikon kii karypranali liver or dandon ke sambandh par aadhaarit hoti he
 Bowden's brakes are based on a stretch of an incompressible wire mounted in a flexible steel tube
 brikon ko chhudaane ke liye kamaani kaam karti he
 Brakes are the main safety device, so brake poles should be harmonized, ie they should not be stuck in the arrows or tires
 danda majboot hone ke saath saath saralata se jodon par ghoomanevaale hone chahie
 Good looking and parts should also be neat and clean

 agar koi dharm-darshan vigyaan kii avadharanaon kaa virdohi hoga to yuva maanas us par vishwaas nahin karegaa
 The ideas of science and spirituality are different
 aadhyatm parmarth gyaan he, aatma-paramatma sambandhit gyaan he, ilme ilaahi he, chinmay satta kaa gyaan he
 Science is the knowledge of the cosmic world, knowledge of physical power, matter, matter, chemistry, analytical-critical knowledge of nature
 saamaanya dharna he ki donon viparitarthak hai
 Thinkers and mystical scholars have to think for the future that how the basic concepts of both can be harmonized? In this regard, Professor Mahavir Saran Jain is of the opinion that if both leave their request then the formula of harmony can be established between the two
 aadhyatm evam vigyaan ke bich samrasya kaa maarg sthapit karne ke liye paramparaagat dharm kii is manyata ko chhodana padegaa ki yah sansar ishwar kii ichha kii parinti he
 We have to accept the view of science that there is no role of God in the business of creation
 sristi rachana vyapaar main prakruti ke niyamon ko sweekaar karnaa hoga
 In the light of Darwin's evolution, the belief of Western thinkers is becoming fragmented in the belief of Western religion that "in the beginning of creation, God created the pair of all beings and God gave man" divine knowledge

 " jeev ke vikaas kii prakriya ke sutara dharm kii is puranic manyata main bhi khoje ja sakate hai ki " jeev churaasi lakh yoniyon main bhatakane ke baad manushya yoni dhaaran karata he " tathaa bhagwaan vishnu ke 10 avatar lene kii puranic manyata kii is pariprekshya main punar mimasaa kii ja sakati he
 The epistemology of the order of Matsyaavatar, Kurmavatar, Varahatavar, Vamanavatar, Narasimhavatar, Parasuramavatar is possible in the context of evolutionism
 vigyaan ko bhi apni bhautikwaadi simaaon kaa atikaraman karnaa hoga
 Science has been purely materialistic
 vigyaan vishwa ke mul main padaarth evam urja ko hi adhishthit dekhtaa aayaa he
 Science will also have to touch the inexplicable Chinmaya power
 bhavishya ke vigyaan ko apana yah aagrah bhi chhodana hoga ki jad padaarth se chetana kaa aavirbhaav hota he
 It is possible to accept this theory of Darwin's evolutionism, that a developed organism has evolved from a degraded organism, but his theory is not logical that the organism evolved from aziva
 meri is dharna athwa manyata kaa taarkik kaaran he
 The thing which causes a causation, it turns into the same form
 chetan ke upadan achetan main nahin badal sakate
 Subliminal products cannot be transformed into conscious
 na kabhi aisa hua he, na ho rahaa he or na hoga ki jeev ajeev ban jaae tathaa ajeev jeev ban jaae
 The properties of memory and intelligence can be produced by the conversion of matter, but consciousness cannot be produced
 chetana kaa adhyayan aadhyatm kaa vishay he
 'knowing' is the individual quality of consciousness
 jeev chetan he
 Ajiv is unconscious
 jeev kaa swabhaav chaitanya he
 The nature of ajiva is inertia or unconsciousness
 jo jaanata he vah jeevatma he
 He who does not know is non-spirit
 jeev aatma sahit he
 Ajiva does not have a soul
 jeev sukh dukh kii anubhuti karata he
 Ajiva does not feel happiness and sorrow
 jo jaanata he, vah chetana he; jo nahin jaanata, vah achetna he
 All the business of memory and intelligence and brain are not 'consciousness'
 padaarth ke roopaantar se smriti evam buddhi ke gunon ko utpann kiya ja saktaa he magar chetana utpann nahin kii ja sakati
 a vision believed that the root world is created by supreme consciousness
 duusari drushti maanati he ki bhautik dravya kii hi satta he
 There is no power other than physical matter
 buddhi evam man kii bhonti chetana bhi 'snayujaal kii baddhata' athwa 'vibhinn tantrikaon kaa tantra' he jo antatah anuon evam aanvik kriyasheeltaa kaa parinaam he
 Looking at it with a futuristic point of view, one has to accept that both of them have different powers
 ajeev athwa jad padaarth kaa roopaantaran urja, smriti, kritrim pragna evam buddhi main sambhav he kintu inamen chaitanya nahin hota
 Computer is not conscious
 computer ko yah chetana nahin hoti ki vah he, vah kaary kar rahaa he
 Computer works inspired by human consciousness
 use sukh dukh kii anubhuti nahin hoti
 He is not self-sensing
 'main hoon,' 'main sukhi hoon', 'main dukhi hoon' - sharir ko is prakaar ke anubhavon kii pratiti nahin hoti
 The feeling of such type of experiences is different from the body
 jise pratiti hoti he use bhartiya darshan aatma shabd se abhihit karte hai
 The soul has a special quality called Chaitanya
 aatma main jaanane kii shakti he
 The soul realizes its existence through the soul
 gyaan kaa mul strot aatma hi he
 Spirit is the essence
 indriyon kaa vah vishay nahin he
 The senses do not know him
 isse indriyon kii seemaa siddh hoti he
 The soul does not exist - it does not prove
 hamaare manishiyon ne annamay, pranamya, manomay, vigyaanmay evam aanandamay koshon kii vivechna kii he
 Presently it is not a holiday for its deliberations
 hamaara mantavya yah pratipaadit karnaa he ki dharm-darshan evam vigyaan ke sambandh kii charchaa ke samay manomay kosh kii upeksha karnaa sambhav nahin he
 We only want to say that the study of psychology can also be helpful in establishing the path of harmony between science and spirituality
 manovigyaan main 'sangyanatmak manovigyaan' par kaary ho rahaa he
 Earlier psychology used to study human behavior only on the basis of stimulus-response behavior
 aaj kaa manovigyaan uddipano or pratikriyaaon ke aadhaar par maanviya vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karne tak simit nahin he
 Now psychology is also using observation, memory, imagination, reasoning, judgment, experience perception etc
 to understand human behavior
 sangyanatmak manovigyaan ke adhyayan kaa aadhaar sangyaan he
 There is a difference between sensation and cognition
 samvedan ke dwaara praani ko uttejnaa kaa abhas hota he
 Through the power of cognition, a person acquires knowledge by organizing senses with differences in name, form, quality etc
 yoga sadhana parampara main dhyaan, dharna tathaa samadhi kaa vishad varnan evam vivechan sulabh he
 Psychology should devise the method and method of interpreting the calm, uninterrupted, void of thought and actionless state of the seeker absorbed in deep meditation and deep meditation oriented in nature
 is prakaar kaa gahan adhyayan aadhyatm evam vigyaan ke madhya sethu kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 Science has to transgress the premise that it is possible to interpret the entire reality through the laws of physics
 is disha main san 1936 main godel dwaara pratipaadit prameya kaa mahatv he
 He proved that many realities of mathematics cannot be proved
 ganit kii yah apurnataa agyaan ke kaaran nahin he
 The reason for this is the basic structure of mathematics
 pehle bhautik-vigyaani maanate the ki bhautikee vyakhya main tarang evam sookshm ansh paraspar vipareet chor hai
 The said theory of physics has become invalid after the invention of atom
 ab sarvamaanya he ki parmaanu kriya kii vyakhya ke liye donon kii saath-saath vyakhya karnaa aavashyak he
 With respect to the atom, it is also worth noting that the parts of the atom can be analyzed mathematically
 parmaanu ke anshon kii kisi bhi vidhi se jhalak paanaa sambhav nahin he
 The microscopic fraction of the energy can be in multiple locations or can travel on multiple routes
