 But once again Tanvir was not in his luck to play, so the selectors decided on the tour of New Zealand at the time that Tanvir was not ready yet, so he was dropped from the team
 lekin phir tanwir ne gharelu cricket main acha pradarshan kiya is kaaran inako tinti - tinti maichon ke liye waapas bula liya
 However, Tanveer did not get a place in odis and Tests earlier and Twenty was not able to play in the last match of Twenty and due to this, it was 13 months for Tanveer to play any international match
 iske baad 2011 cricket vishwa cap main tanwir ko 15 sadsy team main shaamil kiya or pehla match newjiland ke saath khelnaa tha
 Tanvir scored just 6 runs in the first match and also took 1 wicket while bowling

 They are considered to be the greatest prophet of Islam and the last messenger to whom Allah gave the message of the Quran by the angel Jibril
 musalmaan inke liye param aadar bhav rakhte hai
 Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib ibn Hashim was, in short, Muhammad, the last prophet of Islam, and re-founder
 According to Islamic principles, he was a prophet and messenger of Allah, who was sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached by Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and other prophets
 He is seen as the last Prophet of Allah in all the main branches of Islam
 Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam united the Arab State on the basis of al-quran, Sunnah and Hadiths on political and religious lines
 The central religious book of Islam, "al-qur'an", was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad from 610 to 632, which was written for the first time after the death of Hazrat
 Muslims often refer to Muhammad as Prophet Muhammad, or just Prophet
 Rasool refers to Allah, And consider him the best of all prophets
 He is seen by Muslims as the master of all virtues
 When referring to Muhammad, sallallahu alaihi wasallam is used by Muslim people, though "peace be upon them" or "peace be upon them" is also used instead, abbreviating the Arabic phrase as s

 trikoniya surveykshan us vidhi kaa naam he jisamen surveykshan ke liye diye gayi kshetra ko trikoniya tukdon ke jaal ke rup main baantkar surveykshan ko saraltapurvak kar liya jaataa he
 Its principle is very simple - by measuring the angles drawn by a third point from any two points at a known distance, the correct position of that third point can be determined with the help of trigonometric identities
 isaki visheshta yah he ki isamen duuri kaa maapan kam se kam karnaa padataa he or konon ke maapan se kaam chal jaataa he
 Angles are measured more accurately, in less time, with less labor
 saamanyat:, jahaan do dur ke binduon ke bich sidhi duuri naap paanaa sambhav na ho, magar ve aapas me drushtigat hon, vahaan trikoniya surveykshan bada laabhprad hota he
 If on one, two or all the three sides of such a triangle are made to form consecutive triangles and one side of the initial triangle, the regulator of both its vertices and the angles of all the triangles formed, are known, then the lengths of the sides of such an entire triangle and the triangle If the regulators of the points and the angles of all the triangles formed are known, then the lengths of the sides of the entire triangle Regulators of pointing points can be determined by mathematical calculus
 kisi bhi kshetra kaa maanchitr banane ke liye is prakaar ke bindu sampurna kshetra main samaan rup se bikharen hue sthapit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Such points are collectively called 'control structure' for survey and each point is called a 'survey station' separately
 trikoniya surveykshan main gananaa main trikonmittiya sarvasamikaon kii sahaayta lee jaati he jiname nimnlikhit pramukh hai - The methodology, which is suited to the above grounded principles of triangular survey, is mainly divided into four parts: aisi tribhujamala banane ke liye steshnon kaa chayan, jisase surveykshan hetu saare kshetra main samaan rup se bikhare niyantrabindu uplabdh ho saken, To obtain an arm whose length is known and on which the initial triangle is made and its sides are to be woven with a mesh of successive triangles, banaae gaye tribhujon par krmanugat tribhujon sheershabinduon par bane kshaitij or urdhv kone naapnaa or Calculus of point regulators
 sabase pehla kaam steshnon kaa chayan or unhen chihnit karnaa heta he
 Station points are chosen such that from eight to eighty kilometers away from each other and form a triangulated triangle
 tribhujamala saamanyat: teen prakaar kii hoti hai
 The triangles that meet at one point, or the stations at the other ends of the triangles, are mutually visible and are located at a point so that the angles can be read by placing an inductor, theodolite, at the vertex of each triangle
 kone ek hi bindu se or ek hi bindu ko padhe jaae, is suvidha ke liye prayek stesan ko ek pathar par bindu khod kar chihnit kar dete hai
 a circle is made around it to identify the position of the point exactly and correctly
 aisa sthir pathar yadi us sthal par prakritik rup se uplabdh na ho to pathar alag se laakar aise gaad diya jaataa he ki vrut or binduwali sataha prithvi kii sataha se mili baahar dikhaai detii rahe, jisase surveykshan kitni bhi avadhi se baad us sthaan par jaae to stesan ko pahchaanane main samarth ho
 Often, the surveyor draws circles and centers on two stones for safety
 ek ko lagbhag ek meter gaharaa prithvi ke bheetar gaad detaa he or doosraa prithvi kii sataha par aise rakhata he ki donon vritton ke bich khude centrebindu ek hi urdhwadhar rekha par paden
 Some signs are placed around the stations to facilitate remote viewing
 jis kshetra main surveykshan karnaa ho usamen yadi do bindu aise uplabdh hon jo paraspar drushtigochar hon or unke niamak gyaat hon to ek teesraa samuchit bindu chunakar praarambhik tribhuj usapar banaaya ja saktaa he
 To start in any triangle, an arm must be known
 aisi bhujaa ko aadharekha kehete hai
 If the regulator of the points at the end of the baseline is known, its length can be calculated by calculation
 udaahranarth, yadi un binduon ke niamak mulbindu se uttar-dakshin rekha, koti, par kramash:, , tathaa purv-pashchim rekha, bhuj, par, hon to bhujaa kii lambaai hogi : North side of that arm is kone kii aavashyaktaa niamakon kii gananaa main hoti he
 This is called DINMAN
 yadi aise do bindu uplabdh na hon to aadhaar usee samay naapakar sthapit kiya jaataa he
 For this, the surveyor measures a line a on a convenient flat plot around the starting point, with a tape that gives accurate measurements
 aajkal mukhyat: yah naap feete ko rajjuvakr main taang kar lete hai
 The exact horizontal distance between the ends of the ribbon is calculated by calculation
 us par kramash: aise tribhuj banaae jate hai ki pehle ek yaa do tribhujon ko chhodkar kisi bhi tribhuj kaa koi bhi kone 20 degree se kam na ho
 Starting from the base arm, two angles e and e are taken up to 3 degrees
 magar inhen aavriti vidhi se bahut hi yatharth napate hai
 These angles are measured by a device called theodolite
 aadhaar binduon se aarambh karke kramash: sabhi stesan binduon par theodolite kendrit karke kone pard liye jate hai
 The surveyor examines geometric relationships, such as all three angles of a triangle or four angles of a quadrilateral, as all angles of a triangle or quadrilateral are completed
 prithvi kii sataha golakaar hone ke kaaran tribhuj bahut bade hone par uske konon kaa yoga 180 degree se adhik ho jaataa he
 This type of growing is called spherical excess
 75 varg milewaale tribhuj main yah aadhiky 1"" hota he
 Angles are used in calculations by observing observation errors and spherical excesses
 prekshan samaapt hone par praarambhik tribhuj kii aadhaar bhujaa or naape gaye konon kaa prayog kar trikoshmetiya sutara se sabhi bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan gyaat ho jaati hai
 Thereafter, to remove the regulator, the values of the line or lines connecting the unknown point with the known point or points, which have been mentioned earlier, are removed
 gyaat bindu yaa binduon se agyaat bindu kii duuri da or ko dinman gyaat hone se uske niamak mud kojya ko or prad jya ko gyaat kiye ja sakate hai
 These are called rectangular regulators
 yadi urdhv kone bhi kshaitij prekshan ke saath pad jaaen to agyaat bindu kii oonchaai uu a da sp na hogi
 In the above equations, u, po and u are the Uttarayana and Purvayana heights of the known point respectively and the neither are the distance and the deviation of the unknown points respectively
 prithvi ko golabh maanakar binduon ke bhugolic niamak, arthath akshansh or deshaantar, bhi nikle ja sakate hai
 If only one point is known to initiate a triangular survey, the distance from the known station to the known station of the second chosen station is measured by scaling the baseline, and extracted by the propagating base mesh
 dinman dhruvatara or surya aadi ke khagoleey prekshanon se gyaat karte hai
 If the survey is being started for the first time in an area where none of the points are known, regulators of a point are determined by continuous astronomical observation for a few days
 raat ke samay svachh akaash ko din prati din dekhne se vidit hoga ki bahuterey pahchaanane yogya chamkile taare samaan rup se ek gole kii sataha par tairte se dikhaai dete hai
 Their rise and fall will also be seen regularly
 aise gole ko bhi prithvi kii bhanti yamyottaron or samaantaron se bante hone kii grahya kalpana kii ja sakati he, jo ganitiya sutron kaa paalan karti he
 Taking advantage of these facts, the surveyor is able to extract the regulator of the observation station by observing the wires
 usase or naapi hui adharekha se trikoniya surveykshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Public policy or 'public policy' is the policy according to which the administrative executives of the state perform their functions

 And not only this, those who have done good deeds, then also give sardhati prizes to them, such as being made the head of a city or village or the city, etc
 Sanyasati's narrative of Shani is received by many people, like King Vikramaditya, Raja Nal, King Harishchandra, also harasses Saturn's saintly saintly Mahatmas, who begin to indulge in Joga along with Bhoga
 har manushya ko tees saal me ek baar sadhesati avashya aati he, yadi yah saade saati dhanu, min, makar, kumbh raashi me hoti he, to kam peedajanak hoti he, yadi yah sadhesati chauthe, chathe, aathven, or barahawein bhav main hogi, to jataka ko avashya dukhi karegi, or tino sukh shaareerik, maansik, or aarthik ko haran karegi

 Do not forget any new work, new industry, even in a half-century, before doing any work, you must get information from a knowledgeable astrologer

 In this way, it was also realized that whenever Saturn is moving in four, six, eight, twelve, then its original wealth will be destroyed, no matter how much should be done

 aaj bhi kai hindu jane anjaane ravan kii bhaanti pratikatmak taur pe shani praturup ko dukaanon yaa vaahanon main pairon se baandh kar ulta latakaate hai
 Although the mythological suggestion is to do devotion to Shree Hanuman, because Shani Dev gave a boon to Hanuman ji that Hanuman devotees would not have a curved vision of Shani

 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha

 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture

 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the

 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood

 The following were the reasons for the American Civil War- sanyukt rajya america ke uttari rajyon kii sthiti jananaankeey evam aarthik drushti se apekshaakrit majboot thi
 Out of the 34 states of the Union, 23 states were included in the north and 2 / 3 of the total population of the country lived in the north, with a very small number of slaves

 In industries, cotton, woolen garments, leather goods etc
 were produced on a large scale

 On the other hand, the economic life of the southern states of America was based on agriculture and there was not much use of machines in agriculture
 atah in rajyon ke kisaan kheti ke liye gulaamon ke shram par nirbhar the
 In the south, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco were cultivated on a large scale in which slaves worked as laborers
 atah dakshin kaa samaaj purna rup se daason par nirbhar tha
 In this way, the southern state was distinguished from the northern and western parts due to its characteristics, the prevalent slave system and plantation system prevalent there

 Thus, due to economic disparity, there was a big difference in economic life, political ideology and social status of the northern and southern states

 In the southern states, the issue of slavery was always sensitive
 jab kabhi anya rajyon me das pratha par lage pratibandh ko in dakshini, rajyon main lagu karne kii uthi to in rajyon ne ise apni prabhusatta par akraman mana
 In fact, slavery was seen as a stigma on humanity in the northern states and the demand to abolish it was raised
 samachar-patron main madhyam se is das virdohi bhaavana ko ubhaara gaya
 On the other hand the issue of slaves for the southern states was linked to profitability
 unka tark tha ki das pratha main shramik sanghathanon, hadataalon aadi kaa bhay nahin tha tathaa uttari rajyon ke mazdooron kii tulana main ve daason ko adhik suvidha pradaan karte hai

 This boundary line was called the "mesum-dixon" boundary
 ab america kaa pashchimi kshetron main vistaar ho rahaa tha or nae-nae kshetra sanyukt rajya america main shaamil kiye ja rahe the
 In such a situation a question arose whether these states should be included as a slave state or as an independent state

 The dispute deepened over the merger of the state of Missouri

 Lincoln's victory, therefore, seemed inauspicious to the southern states

 So the first reaction in the southern states was made by the state of Carolina and it announced its separation from the Union

 The separation of the Union by the Southern States raised an important constitutional question whether the Southern States had the right to secede from the Union? Lincoln, after his election to the presidency, declared unequivocally that the union that was established as the United States of America was unbroken and eternal, that its indefensibility would not be allowed to be destroyed in any way
 america samvidhan nirmaataaon ne kisi rajya ko sangh se pruthak hone kaa adhikaar nahin diya he

 " is tarah linkan ne sangh ko bachaae rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 During the war, it did not allow the southern states to have relations with foreign countries through diplomatic skill
