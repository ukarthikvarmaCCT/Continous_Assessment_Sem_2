 But as long as the sun, moon and planets were considered to be images and stars, light could not be known about them
 italy ke jyotishi gallilyon gallily ne san 1612 main akashamandal ke adhyayan main pehali baar doordarshee kaa prayog kiya; kintu jab tak doordarshee kii rachana main samuchit unnati nahin hui, iske upyog se bhi grahprishthon ke adhyayan ke atirikt koi or vishesh mahatvapurn soochna na praapt kii ja saki
 As the design of the telescope continued to improve, its utility in astrological research increased, but astronomy began in the second quarter of the 19th century, when the German physicist, Gustaf Robert Kirkhhoff, in the study of the sun and other starlight, The principles of spectrography propounded by is saadhan ke vikaas main photography se atyant sahaayta mili, kyonki isaki sahaayta se aalokit varncrampatt sthaayee rup se tulanaatmak adhyayan ke liye uplabdh hone lage
 The same photometry and means of measuring the intensity of the spectral lines provided invaluable information about the physical state of celestial bodies, aiding in the study of spectrometry
 jab koi gas jalaai jaati he tab, kirkhhof ke siddhant ke anusaar, vah shwet prakaash kaa vikiran na karke keval vishesh varnon ke prakaash kaa hi vikiran karti he
 These characters are called characteristic characters of gas
 in varnon main koun koun se varna prakat honge, yah us bhautik avasthaa main sthit deeptiman gas main se yadi shwet prakaash gaman kare, to shwet prakaash kaa varnakram santat nahin hota, varan usamen gas ke lakshanik varna anupasthit hote hai
 Additionally, if the temperature of the origin of white light is higher than the temperature of the gas, black lines, called Fraunhofer lines, appear in place of the characteristic characters of the gas in the spectroscope
 in kaali rekhaon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki shwet prakaash kis kis gas main gaman karke varnakramdarshi tak pahunchaa he tathaa uske gas parmaanu kis bhautik avasthaa main hai
 Kirkhoff proposed this theory based on experiments
 parantu aage chalakar parmanurachana ke gyaan or kwantum siddhant kii sahaayta se varnakramiki ke niyamon kaa pratipaadan saidhantik rup se kiya ja sakaa
 It is clear from the above statement that there is a natural limit to the utility of spectral means in the study of astrophysics
 yah isliye ki varnakramdarshi padaarth kii bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main tabhi soochna de saktaa he jab yah padaarth deeptiman gas ke rup main ho
 Therefore, by this means it will not be able to know what substances are located in the path of light and what is their physical state
 khagoleey pindon se jo prakaash aata he vah uske aantarik bhaagon main utpann hota he, phir bhi un bhaagon kii rachana ke vishay main varnakramdarshi kii sahaayta se kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He is only able to give information about the gas circle that surrounds these bodies
 falat: in pindon ke aantarik bhaagon kii rachana tathaa bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main jaanane ke liye varnakramiki se bhinn sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 These tools will be described further
 agyayan ke sadhano ke vichaar se tarapind ko do mukhya bhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he: aantarik bhaag or gasmandal Based on the study of the spectrum, many facts have been known about stars, the main of which is the following: surya tathaa anya taare deeptiman gas ke vishaal goleey pind hai, jinke aantarik bhaagon ke prishth kaa taap, jise prishthiya kehete hai, sahasron anshon tak hota he
 As the stars move towards the center of the star, the temperature increases; Even the central temperature is found to be several hundred thousand
 ? The interior of each star is surrounded by a gasosphere
 in gasmandalon main jo tatv pahachaane gaye he ve sab prithvi par bhi paae jate hai
 This does not mean that there will be no other elements here than those found on earth
 vastav main taron ke varnakram main aisi fronhophar rekhaayen pai jaati hai jo prithvi par paae janevaale kisi bhi tatv kii rekhaon se bhinn hai
 Hydrogen, helium, carbon, iron, etc
 are mainly present in the gas system of stars
 bhartiya jyotishi, meghnad saaha, ne san 1922 main apane prasiddh ooshmpyanan sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya, jisaki sahaayta se varnakram pattee kaa vaastavik tathy samajha ja saktaa he
 The Saha Sutra, after the visionary, is the most important invention in astrology, in the words of the famous British astrologer Eddington
 taare ke satat varnakram ke adhyayan se uskaa prabhavi taap nishchit kiya jaataa he
 In the exploration it is imagined that Tara is an ideal Krishna body, which means that its surface is organized in such a way that it completely absorbs all the radiation that falls on it
 kirkhhof or bailphor or stuart ne yah siddh kiya he ki yadi pind kii urja main parivartan na ho, to prayek varna main uske vikiran or avasorana kii matraayen ek vishesh anupaat main hoti hai
 The word Krishna has no relation to the visible color of the body
 aise pind ke saidhantik, athwa prayogtmak, adhyayan ne yah siddh kiya he ki vishesh taap par prayek varna kii tivrata nishchit hoti he
 Planck has formulated a formula based on thermodynamics, which suggests that in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, there is a certain intensity of radiation of a character of the ideal Krishna body
 upar diya rekhachitr tarangadaidhray or vikiran kii tivrata main sambandh bataata he
 For a given temperature of the body, the limited area between the axis of the curve and the wavelength determines the total energy that the radiating star is emitting every moment in the sky
 in vakron se yah bhi spasht he ki pind ke taap main parivartan ke saath hi saath mahattam tivrata ke tarangadaidhray main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 In fact, as the temperature of the body increases, the wavelength of greatest intensity decreases, that is, it moves towards the visible part in the spectrum
 adarsh krishna pind ke liye plank niyam ke anusaar taap or mahattam tivrata ke tarangadaidhray ke sambandh ko prakat karanevaala sutara saralata se gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 Therefore, to determine the effective temperature of the star, firstly by studying its spectrum, the wavelength of radiation of greatest intensity is found
 taare kaa prabhavi taap vastav main us adarsh krishna pind kaa taap he jiske vikiran kii mahattam tivrata usee tarangadaidhray main he jisamen taare kii
 There is a large variation in the spectral text of the strings, but even if the main focus is on the main Fraunhofer lines, these spectra sheets can be divided into a few sections

 Some letters have been used in this classification, which have no special scientific basis except for convenience
 is vargeekaran ke mukhya varg o, ba, e, pha, ga, k tathaa m se chihnit kiye jate hai suvidha ke liye inamen se prayek varg das upvargon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, the square of a star is determined based on the intensity of the major absorption lines in its spectrum, which depend on both temperature and pressure
 at: vargeekaran main taap evam daab kaa prabhaav is prakaar vichaar me liya jaataa he ki adhikansh taare do mukhya shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja saken : vishaal taare or vaaman taare or tab prayek shrenee main avasorana rekhaon kii tivrataayen itane niyamanusaar badalati hai ki di hui tivrataon ke liye taare ke varg kaa, falat: uske prabhavi taap kaa, nishchay anany rup se kiya ja saktaa he
 The temperature of a large star of a given square is less than the temperature of the star of the same class
 surya vaaman shrenee kaa sadsy he
 The following table gives the characteristics of effective heat and spectrum for the Vamana series wires corresponding to these classes: aage chalakar avishisht awalokit taron ko vargeekaran main sammilit karne ke liye is vargeekaran ke prarambh main varg va or ant main na, r tathaa sa virgon kaa yoga kar diya falat: prachlit vargeekaran is prakaar he: The spectral instrument also revealed that many stars, which appear alone in photographs taken by the greatest telescopes, are actually two stars, which revolve around their center of gravity
 in taron ko varnakramdarsheey yugmak taare kehete hai
 The spectral lines of radiant gas located in a magnetic field are much wider than the radiated lines in the normal state and are broken up into two and sometimes more sublines
 ise jeman prabhaav kehete hai
 Babcock found this effect to exist in the spectroscopes of some stars, on the basis of which he concluded that these stars had magnetic fields similar to the Sun
 taron ke bich ke sthaan main sampurna rup se padaarth kaa abhaav nahin he
 There is very diffused dust and corpuscles present there
 udaahranarth, akashganga main surya ke sameep prati ghan senmi0 main madhyat: ek hydrogen parmaanu prati ghan senmi0 or prati ghan kimi0 main 10-5 senmi0 ardhavyas ke lagbhag 25 pindkhand paae jate hai
 Thus the density of the substance located in this place is about 3-10-24 grams per cubic cm
 taron ke gasmandal main bhi padaarth kaa ghanatav lagbhag itnaa hi hota he
 This statement is not true about other parts of the galaxy
 ab yah nishchit rup se gyaat he ki prayek niharika ke bhinn bhinn bhaagon main ghanatv bhinn he
 The tendency of matter within the star is found to be present as dense clouds of gas
 in meghon kaa punj taron ke punj or kabhi kabhi vishaal taramandal ke punj, ke samaan hota he
 This cloud not only absorbs the light of the stars behind it, but also scatter it, due to which the light of the star starts to feel like blood color; For example, the molecules of the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight at dusk and give blood to the Sun
 is prakirnan kii maatra ke adhyayan se hi taare ke bheetar ke padaarth main vidyaman pindkhandon ke madhyapariman kaa nishchay kiya jaataa he
 As already written, there is no physical means of knowing the internal composition of the stars
 at: is sanghatan kaa adhyayan karne ke liye ganitiya sadhano kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 a simple model of the inner part of the star, conceived of the observed material and the physical principles, is imagined and then the physical goals of this model are determined in the manner of mathematics
 yadi ye lakshan taron ke aalokit lakshanon ke samaan hon, to yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki taare ke aantarik bhaag main bhi waisi hi bhautik avasthaaen vidyaman hai jaisi praturup main
 How many such models have been studied
 iske falswaroop taron ke aantarik bhaag ke sanghatan ke vishay main samuchit gyaan praapt kiya ja sakaa hai
 Some types of star mass and their radius are known
 iske atirikt prayek taare kaa yah aavashyak lakshan he ki vah satat akaash main sab ore urja kaa vikiran karata rahata he
 The rate of radiation of energy, which is called the star's light, is as important as the star's mass and radius
 yadi taron ke punj or unte ardhvyaason kaa rekhachitr khinchaa jaae, to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki taare lagbhag teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 The drawing of stars and astrologers also supports this statement
 adhikansh taron ke liye unki jyoti punj ke lagbhag 3
5 ghaat ke anusaar vicharan karti he
 The group of these stars is called the main category
 jo taare is shrenee se bhinn hai, ve do prakaar ke hote hai : shwet vaaman or trumpler taare
 The light of the trumpler stars varies in proportion to their mass
 yadi ek hi punj kii mukhya shrenee ke taron or shwet-vaaman kii jyotiyon ore ardhvyaason kii tulana karen, to yah paaya jaataa he ki shwet vathan mukhya shrenee ke taare kii apeksha bahut kam jyetishman hota he or uskaa ardhavyas bhi bahut kam hota he
 Therefore, the substance of white vamana should be very dense
 dwitiya-lubdhak shwet-vaaman shrenee kaa pratinidhi mana jaataa he
 Its mean density is about 6
8 j 104 grams per cubic cm
 yahi yaheen, yadi ek hi prabhavi taap ke mukhya shrenee ke taron or shwet vaaman kii jyotiyon kii tulana karen, to shwet vaaman mukhya shrenee ke taare kii apeksha bahut hi kam jyetishmaan hota he
 These variations are indicative of differences in the internal composition of the stars
 mrittika ek vyapak shabd he
 Sedimentary rocks with diameters smaller than 2 microns are often referred to as 'clay
' yah mukhyatah almunium ke silicket evam anya bahusilicket kaa mishran he
 The main minerals made of clay are called 'clay minerals'
 bhootkneekee drushti se mrittika un mrittika khanijon ko kehete hai jinke kanon kaa aakaar 4 micron se chota hota he
 The clay is predominantly brown but clay of other colors is also found

 kraine baari chizon ko uthaane kii mashin he
 Cranes are fitted with one or more simple machines that provide mechanical advantage for lifting objects so that even those objects are beyond the normal human lifting capacity
 praaia: yatayaat udyog main crenon kaa bahut upyog hota he
 Similarly, in construction industries, heavy parts have to be lifted with a crane to assemble
 kraine baari mashiinon or unke bhaagon ko ek sthaan se uthaakar duusare sthanon par le janevaala yantra
 It is difficult to lift a heavy object higher than the power of the hand, so heavy work of this type is taken from the cranes
 kai prakaar ke crenon kaa aakalpan hua he or kaamon ke anusaar unka upyog hota he
 There are some cranes that are stationary in their place
 ye bhaar yaa mashiinon ko uthaakar keval ek hi kshaitij disha main le ja sakate hai
 If cranes are placed under the cranes, these cranes carry the load at one place
 kraine shabd se mulat: abhipraay us lambii chad se hi he, jiske dwaara bhaar yaa mashiinon kaa uthaaya jaataa he, parantu ab puri mashin ko hi kraine kehete hai
 In this way, the combined form of rods, pulleys and parts which are operated are called cranes
 upyogita ke kaaran crenon kaa vishesh prachlan ho gaya he
 They are used to install heavy machines in the factories and carry the weaving items
 jin sthanon par nadi, naale yaa band banaae ja rahe hon vahaan ye mitti uthaane ke kaam main bhi aate hai
 This work cannot be done by hand in months, it can be done in a few hours from these cranes
 kraine ke kaam karne ke niyam ko samajhane ke liye parshv chitra kii ghiraniyaan dekhen
 It has two pulleys at the top and bottom and the same path goes through all the pulleys
 bindu 1 par bal lagane se rassa khinchnaa aarambh hoga or bhaar upar ko uthne lagegaa
 Suppose the weight rises one foot, then the four lengths of towing will be reduced and the weight will be raised one foot, because the rope is four feet long from all the pulleys
 at: bhaar ko ek foot uthaane ke liye rasse ko chaar foot kheenchna hoga
 This will divide the entire load on the four ropes and less weight will be required to lift the load
 isi prakaar kii ghiraniyaan kraine main bhi lagi hoti hai jahaan bhaar ke uthte hi kraine kii chad bhi chalane lagati he or bhaar khadi tathaa kshaitij disha main le jaaya jaataa he
 There are two types of cranes, one rotating, the other rotating
 ghoomanevaale kraine ve hai jinase bhaar ko uthaakar kshaitij disha main kahin par bhi daalaa ja sakati he
 Among these are some who move around from their place and some are those who only rotate at an angle of 180 degrees
 is prakaar ke crenon ko bahu-kraine kaha jaataa he
 The other types of cranes are those from which the crane can be moved to another location by lifting the load forward or backward, right or left
 is prakaar ke kraine kaarkaanon main chhaton ke neeche lagaae jate hai
 These are called overhead cranes, as they move above the ends
 in crenon se saaj saamaan uthaakar kaarkaane ke kisi kone main kahin par bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The cranes are run by a variety of measures
 chote or baari bhaagon ko uthaanewaale kraine haath se chalaae jate hai
 Steam power, electric power or ombus power are used to drive large cranes
 kaam yaa mahatv ke anusaar hi shakti kii aavyashkta hoti he
 Hand-operated cranes are not useful for long lifts of heavy loads, they are useful only when lifting goods for a short time
 yadi in crenon se baari mashiinon kaa uthaanaa ho to adhik samay or adhik manushyashakti kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Therefore, these cranes are good only for small works
 bhaap se chalanevaale kraine baari kaamon ke liye prayukt hote hai
 For these cranes, the steam evaporator is either attached to the crane, or steam is given to several cranes from one evaporator
 jin crenon main vaashpitra saath hota hai unako ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par saralata se le jaaya ja saktaa he
 They can be used in places where there is no electricity and heavy work has to be done
 yatha-us sthaan par jahaan par band yaa pul banaaya ja rahaa ho or vah aabaadi se dur ho, yah aavashyak hota he
 If several cranes have to work at one place, then giving different evaporators for each one will cost more and each crane will take longer to run
 aise sthaan ke liye ek bada vaashpitra lagaaya jaataa he, jisase sab crenon ko bhaap di jaati he
 Aambhas cranes are very powerful and efficient
 keval ek kapaat ko kholane or band karne se hi is kraine ko chalaaya ja saktaa he
 See this type of crane in the picture
 is chitra main bai ore anbhas rambh he jiske neeche ek ghirani lagaai gai he
 It is encased on top of its mesh
 dahini ore ke chitra main rambh ke sthaan par rasse yaa kraine kaa ek kinaaraa band diya gaya he
 This rope goes through the pulley and on to the weight which has to be lifted
 is kraine main kul teen ghiraniyaan hai
 Therefore, when the mesh is lifted one foot, the load will rise six feet, because there are six towers on the pulleys, thus the load can be lifted up to six times the speed of the crane mesh
 kam daam par bijli mil jane ke kaaran vidyucchalit crenon kaa upyog bad gaya he
 These cranes can be operated without any difficulty
 aise crenon ko chalaanevaale garmi or dhuen se bhi bache rahete hai
 The power of the crane is based on the power of the motor itself
 kraine par puraa bhaar kabhi hi padataa he, isiliye cre na ke motor kii shakti kii jaankaree ke liye iskaa bhaar anupaat dekha jaataa he
 The weight ratio is the ratio of time to work and time to work
 maan lijie, kisi motor kaa bhaar anupaat 1 / 3 he
 This means that the motor will give only three minutes full power in 12 minutes or in three minutes only one minute will get full power and the stop will be only two minutes
 isaliye aise sthanon par jahaan bhaar ko adhik unchaa uthaanaa he or kaam thode thode samay ke pashchaat karnaa he bhaar-anupaat bhi adhik hona chahie
 If the load is to be lifted low and not carried too far, as in factories where heavy loads are sometimes carried and that too for short periods of time, then a motor of high weight-to-weight ratio is not required
 kam oonchaai par dur tak bhaar uthaakar le janevaali kraine ko chalaanevaali motor kaa bhaar-anupaat bhaar uthaanewaali motor ke bhaar-anupaat se avashya hi adhik hona chahie
 Steam cranes have to give steam only when lifting
 isaliye vaashpitra par kabhi kabhi puraa bhaar padegaa
 When the load is being tied in a fork, or the crane is returning by putting the load, the steam is not taken out of the steam and at the same time the evaporator makes its nipple
 maan len, kraine main 40 ashv shakti kaa ingine laga hua he
 For this engine, the temperature of the evaporator installed on the crane is 1 / 4 of that of the evaporator, which is required to give its equal steam, then the work will be fine
 isaliye crenon main chote vaashpitron se bada acha kaam liya jaataa he
 For this reason the size of the crane is also less and the expenditure is also less
 at: ham kah sakate he ki crenon kii motaron ke liye yadi bhaar-anupaat 1 / 3 se 1 / 6 tak rakhaa jaay to kraine ke kaam par koi dushprabhav na padegaa
 There are graded motors for electric cranes that are electrically electrified and have great spasms while running
 bhaar uthaate samay adhik bal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, kintu ek baar bhaar uthaa lene par itane adhik bal kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 Therefore, there is no difficulty in lifting the load due to excessive spasm of this motor
 is motor kaa ek gun yah bhi he ki mand gati par isse bade bhaar bhi uthaae ja sakate he or halake bhaaron ko adhik gati se
 The first task of the crane is to lift the load upwards
 kisi kaante main latakaakar bhaar uthaa liya jaataa he
 For this work, one will require a long house, which will increase the working area of the crane, and the other will require machines to run this earth
 chitra 3
 main dikhalaai gai kraine main isaki dharni he, jisapar is kraine kii kshaitij disha kaa kaam nirbhar he
 There is a pulley on the upper part of this earth, from which the chain carrying crane machines goes to the fork
 yah zanjeer paryaapt lambii hoti he or kraine kii mashin par lage hue ek bade belan par lipati rahati he
 When lifting a load or a machine, the chain is rotated in reverse by rotating the machine in reverse and while lifting the load, the cylinder rotates upright and keeps the chain wrapped on itself
 jab bhaar uth jaataa he to kraine ke khambhe ko ghumaakar bhaar ko yathasthaan le jate hai
 The simplest crane figure in the stationary cranes is shown
 teen taangon ke derick ke bich ghiraniyaan lagaakar rasson ke dwaara bhaar ko upar uthaa liya jaataa he
 Thus the load from the crane cannot be carried in the horizontal direction
 yah keval mashiinon ke angon ko ek duusare ke upar rakhane ke hi kaam aata he
 The crane of Fig
 5
 has a horizontal pole on a standing pole, which can move around
 is prakaar ke kraine se bhaar ko uthaakar kahin bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he
 If wheels are placed under the base of this crane, it can also be moved or moved or moved from place to place
 dharni ke dahini ore kaanta he jo aage peeche or upar neeche kiya ja saktaa he
 On the left side of this house are the pulleys and cranes
 dharni ke ye donon bhaag ek duusare kaa santulan banaae rakhte hai
 Can be placed at any place on the top or bottom of the dental pole that rotates the earth
 bhaap se chalanevaale ek kraine chitra saamne dikhaaya gaya he
 It has a crane steamer on a rotating base
 ingine se chalane vaala vah dhol he jisapar kraine kii zanjeer lipati rahati he
 Along with this, the chain is pulled or released to lift and fall the ground
 is prakaar bhaar uthaane ke samay kaante ke saath saath kraine kii dharni ko uthaane kaa bhi prabandh kiya jaataa he
 With this, the load can be lifted up considerably
 bhaar ko uthaane ke pashchaat kraine ke aadhaar ko ghumaakar bhaar ko aavashyak sthaan par chhod dete hai
 The balance of these cranes needs to be taken care of, as the reversal of these types of cranes has resulted in accidents
 bhaap se chalanevaale crenon main to vaashpitra hi tolan kaa kaam detaa he, parantu duusare crenon main prishth kii ore baari baari pathar band dete hai
 As the load is lifted the rear loads balance it and as it rises, its distance from the center of the crane decreases
 is samay kraine ke santulan ke peeche kii ore utane kii bhaar aavashyaktaa nahin rahati jitne kii bhaar ko uthaane ke samay thi
 So if the chain is broken, or the load is placed behind enough that the crane cannot keep its balance, the crane will reverse
 chitra 7
 main upari kraine dikhaai gayi he
 The pulleys and machines are mounted on horizontal grooves and are located at the place of earthwork
 yadi is kraine ko kaarkaane kii lambaai main bhi kaam main laana pade to isko chalaanevaali kraine banaate hai
 For this, the walls are planted on both the walls of the length of the factory and the circle is placed on the walls of the wall with cranes
 is prakaar yah kraine kaarkaane kii lambaai or chaudaai donon ore kaam kar saktaa hai
 Nowadays different types of cranes are in use
 nayaa aakalpan bijli kii nai mashiinon ke kaaran he, parantu har kraine ke kaam karne kaa siddhant vahi he jo upar bataaya gaya he
 Electric motor provides more and required power and can be run as you want
 kaam karne main samay bhi kam lagata he or laagat bhi kam aati he
 Cranes are difficult to operate without the use of restraints
 bhaar uthaate samay sangharsh tathaa gurutv ke viruddh kaam kiya jaataa he
 When the load is brought down, it has to be brought carefully
 isi kaam ke liye crenon main aarodh lagaae jate hai, jinase chalati hui kraine ko roka ja saktaa hai
 In cranes who work on Ambas, this work is taken from its valve itself and then the Aambas Aroh are also more capable
 kraine kii mashiinon ke dholon par sangharshapattiyaan chadhaai jaati hai
 When required, they are fastened to the top of the drum and the crane is stopped
 in aarodhon ko kraine ke chalaane ke sthaan se hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In electric cranes, the wiring of its motor is placed in such a way that when the load is being lowered, the motor becomes a dynamo, which produces electricity and provides the job of resistance
 bhaap se chalanevaali crenon main sab kaam do silinder ke ingine se hota he
