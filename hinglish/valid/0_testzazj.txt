 prerani motor prayavarti dhara se chalane vaali motor he jiske roter kii koniya chaal stater vinding dwaara paidaa kiye gayi ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii koniya chaal se kam hoti he
 For this reason this motor is called asynchronous motor
 ise 'preran motor' is kaaran kaha jaataa he kyonki iske roter main preran ke dwaara dhara utpann hoti he kyonki roter tathaa ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii chaal alag-alag hoti he
 This motor is most commonly used due to which it is called the workhorse of industries
 isamen ghisne vaala koi avyav nahin he jisase yah bina marammat ke bahut dino tak chal saktaa he
 It is of many types- gharon main saamaanya kaaryon evam kam shakti ke liye prayukt adhikansh motaren ek-feji preran motor hi hotin hai inhen fractional horshpawar motor bhi kehete hai
 For example wings, motors for washing machines, etc
 prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi disht dhara motaron kii bhanti hi kshetrakundaliyaan tathaa armechar hote hai, parantu kuch vibhinn rup main
 They consist of two main parts: one is the stator, which remains fixed and the other rotor which rotates
 prayavarti dhara motaren bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai
 The most-common alternating current motor is the induction motor, which operates on the principle of induction
 preran motaron main stater kundalan trikla sambharan se sambhddha hota he, jiske kaaran ek ghurni chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 The conductors of the rotor can also be in the form of triangular coils, which are short-circuited by copper rings at both ends
 aisi rachana vastut:, gilahari ke pinjre kii bhanti hoti he
 Hence, such motors are commonly called 'squirrel Panzer Induction Motor', or 'panjar Motor' only
 ye motor banaavat main bahut sudrudh hote hai tathaa saath hi saath saral tathaa saste bhi hote hai
 Their efficiency is also higher than other motors of the same size
 atev in motaron kaa prayog praaia: saarvatrik he
 But the operation of these motors is, in a way, determined by the design of the rotor and cannot be changed as per the requirement
 inkaa aarambhik balaghurna bahut kam hota he, jise sudhaarney ke liye roter paripath main kuch pratirodh nivisht karnaa aavashyak hota he, parantu sthir praroop kii rachana ke kaaran aisa sambhav nahin ho paata
 Also, the resistance of the rotor drivers cannot be increased permanently, as the loss will increase more and the efficiency of the motor will decrease
 adhik aarambhik, balaghurna praapt karne ke liye dwipanjar motor prayukt kiye jate hai, jinamein ek ke sthaan par do panjar hote hai
 Depending on the type and position of the rotor grooves, some variation in operating characteristics can be achieved and they can be qualified for a variety of purposes
 kisi asi motor kii tulykaalik chaal n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} se aashay uske stater ke ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii chaal se he
 Its value can be derived from the following formula- jahaan f { \ displaystyle f} motor kii supplai kii aavriti tathaa p { \ displaystyle p} chumbakeey dhruvon kii sankhya he udhaaharan ke liye, 50 hertz kii supplai tathaa, 6 pole vaale teen-feji motor ke liye p { \ displaystyle p} = 6 tathaa n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} = 1,000 RPM Slip s { \ displaystyle s} is often defined as follows- jahaan n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} sincronas speed, n r { \ displaystyle n_{r}} roter kii chaal yadi roter sincronas chaal se gum rahi ho to slip kaa maan shunya hoga, yadi roter bilkul na chal rahi ho to slip kaa maan 1 hoga
 The value of the fault generated by the motor depends on the slip of its rotor
 jisko 'slip-tork vaishishty' kaha jaataa he
 It is clear that induction motors run at 'almost' constant speed
 bhaar ke saath unka chaal vicharan bahut kam hota he
 Therefore, loads that require steady movement are very useful there
 parantu jahaan vicharanshil chaal kii aavashyaktaa ho, vahaan panjar motor saamanyat: prayukt nahin kiye jate
 Their speed is slightly less than synchronous speed, which depends on the pole number and frequency
 at: chaal vicharan karne ke liye yaa to dhruv sankhya main parivartan karnaa aavashyak he, athwa aavriti kaa hi vicharan karnaa aavashyak he
 Frequency variance refers to arranging a separate supply whose frequency can be changed
 iske liye aajkal char aavriti drive aa rahe hai
 The pole number can be changed to a specific ratio by changing the connection of the coil, such as it is possible to convert a 4 polar motor to an 8 polar or 6 polar motor
 is prakaar in dhruv sankhyaon ke tatsambandhi veg bhi praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 The synchronous speed of 4 polar motor at 1,500 cyclic frequency is 1,500 RPM and that of 6 polar and 8 polar are 1,000 and 750 RPM respectively
 is tarah aisi motor kii dhruv sankhya main parivartan kar, inaki tatsambandhi chaal praapt kii ja sakati he
 But these can only happen in two or three sequences
 is vidhi se vistrut paraas main chaal vicharan praapt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Another method of gait variance in certain sequences is called "sopanipat control"
 yah vidhi belan milon main adhiktar prayukt kii jaati he
 Different types of machine tools also require variable speed, but in general, the variance is done by changing the gear order

 For fisheries, ponds ranging from 0
2 hectare to 5
0 hectare should be selected in which water should be filled for 8-9 months throughout the year
 talabon ko sadabahaar rakhane ke liye jal kii aapurti kaa saadhan hona chahie
 One to two meters of water must remain in the pond throughout the year
 talab aise kshetron main chune jaayen jo baadh se prabhavit na hote hon tathaa talab tak aasaani se pahunchaa ja sake
 Shredded and raised bumps, uneven bottom, lack of water inroads, chances of more water coming from other areas, etc
 The deficiencies are naturally found in the pond which can be rectified and removed
 can be done

 matsay paalan prarambh karne se purv yah atyadhik aavashyak he ki machhlee kaa beej daalane ke liye talab purna rup se upyukt ho
 Excessive aquatic plants in the pond are harmful for good fish yield
 yah paudhe pani kaa bahut bada bhaag ghere rahete hai jisamen machhlee ke ghoomane-phirane main asuvidha hoti he
 At the same time, they also create a barrier to the rays of the sun reaching inside the water

 Apart from this, these plants increase their potency by polluting the chemical substances found in the soil and the nutritional value of water is reduced
 machhlee pakadaney ke liye yadi jaal chalaaya jaay tab bhi yah paudhe rukawat daalate hai
 Generally, there are three types of aquatic plants in ponds - one with water surface such as hyacinth, lemna etc
, second root-like lotus etc
 and third water-immersed like hydrilla, najaj etc
 yadi talab main jaleey paudhon kii maatra kam ho to inhen jaal chalaakar yaa shramik lagaakar jad se ukhadkar nikaala ja saktaa he
 In case of excess aquatic vegetation, use of chemicals such as 2-4 d sodium salts, teficide, hexamar and Fernaxan in 8-10 kg per hectare of water area, water hyacinth, lotus etc
 are destroyed
 rasayanon ke prayog ke samay vishesh jaankaree matsay vibhaag ke karyaalayon se praapt kii jaani chahie
 Some submerged plants are the favorite food of grass carp fish, so they can be prevented by grasping grapes in the pond
 upyukt yahi he ki anaavashyak paudhon kaa unmoolan maanav-shakti se hi sunishchit kiya jaay
 In the old ponds many unnecessary animals like turtles, frogs, crabs and fishes like Sindhri, Puthiya, Chelwa etc
 and eater fishes are found for example Pichin, Tangen, Saul, Girai, Singhi, Mangur etc
 which are available to feed the food available in the pond
 Receive as food
 maansaahaari machhliyaan carp machhliyon ke bacchon ko kha jaati he jisase matsay paalan par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Therefore, their cleanliness is absolutely necessary
 avaanchhneeya machhliyon kaa nishkasana baar-baar jaal chalaakar yaa pani nikaal kar athwa mahua kii khali ke prayog dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Mahu cake should be used in a pond with a depth of one meter of water in one hectare area at the rate of 25 quintals
 iske parinaam swaroop 6-8 ghanton main sari machhliyaan mar kar upar aa jaati hai jinhen jaal chalaakar ekatra karke bazaar main bechaa ja saktaa he
 Use of Mahu cake has dual effect for the pond

 In this way, a mixture of chemical fertilizer of 49 kg per hectare per month should be put in the pond after 15 days of use of cow dung
 yadi talab ke pani kaa rang gaharaa haraa yaa gaharaa nila ho jaye to urvarkon kaa prayog tab tak band kar dena chahie jab tak pani kaa rang uchit avasthaa main na aa jaye
 Accumulation of pure seeds of such good fish species in the pond should be ensured that, while staying in the same aquatic environment, do not harm each other and consume the food available on different surfaces of the pond and grow rapidly
 bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu evam nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp evam kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan vishesh laabhakaari hota he

 Special emphasis is being given on the privatization of fish seed production with the objective of making Uttar Pradesh self-sufficient in the field of fish seed production and up to Rs 8
00 lakh for setting up a mini fish seed hatchery with a capacity of 10 million in the private sector
 Facility of loan and 10 percent government grant is permissible
 matsay paalak nijee kshetron main sthapit chote aakaar kii hechariyon se bhi shuddh beej praapt kar sakate hai
 Such fish species should be reared in the pond, which will grow rapidly by using the food available on each surface without harming each other by living together in an environment so that maximum fish production from a confined water area To be sure bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu, nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp va kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan kaaphi laabhakaari hota he
 Before storing fish seed in the pond, it is worth noting that preparations have been completed and organic production has been done
 machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan jise planctan kehete hai paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hona chahie
 The availability of one milliliter of plant in 50 liters of water in the pond indicates that fish seed can be stored

 If six types of domestic and foreign carp fishes are being mixed, then the ratio of katla 20 percent silver carp 10 percent, rohu 30 percent, grass carp 10 percent, nan 15 percent and common carp 15 percent is appropriate
 yadi silver carp va grass carp machhliyon kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he or 4 prakaar kii machhliyaan paali ja rahi hai to sanchay anupaat katala 40 pratishat, rohu 30 pratishat, nain 15 pratishat va kaaman carp 15 pratishat hona laabhakaari hota he
 If only Indian major carp fishes are being reared then the ratio of katla 40 percent, rohu 30 percent, nan 30 percent should be
 kaaman carp machhlee kaa beej march, april va may main tathaa anya carp machhliyon kaa beej july, agast, sitambar main praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For high yields of fish, it is absolutely necessary to have suitable soil and water in the pond

 yahi vajah he ki naaji akraman ke dauraan rus ne uskaa safaltaapurvak saamana kiya

 Conversely, close study of Saturn's rings has revealed that its rings have been intact since the early days of the solar system, that is, they have been in existence for billions of years

 rin niyantran yaa 'credit niyantran' yah keval bhugtan karne main sakasham hai, jo graahakon ke liye rin detaa he ki kuch karne ke liye ek vyapaar dwaara istemaal kiya pranali he, or graahakon ko samay par bhugtan karte hai

 The task of the Reserve Bank of India is the most important for controlling debt in the economy
 arthvyavastha main rin niyantran ke buniyadi or mahatvapurn jaruratein hai- 1
 To encourage the overall development of those sectors of the economy i
e
 "priority sector" which are recognized by the government as "on priority basis" depending on their economic status or government interest
 in kshetron main mote taur par sankhya main lagbhag 15 karne ke liye yoga
 2
credit is not given for undesirable purposes, so as to keep a check on the channelization of the loan
 3
apsfiti ke rup main ke rup main acchhee tarah se mudrasphiti ko niyantrit karne ke uddeshy ko praapt karne ke liye
 4
to boost the economy by facilitating the flow of substantial amounts of bank credit to various sectors
 5
arthvyavastha ko viksit karne ke liye
 There are two ways the Reserve Bank of India uses it to control the supply of money in the economy
 bharat kii mudrasphiti rigerv bank kii avadhi ke dauraan apsfiti ke dauraan yah arthvyavastha main paise pump karne ke liye vanijyik bank kii anumati detaa he, jabaki paise kii aapurti simit karne ke liye apni nitiyon ko majboot karata he
 By quality we are instructed which means the bank uses the loan
 bank udhaaharan ke liye, darshakon yaa bade puunjipatiyon laghu udyog, jabaki upabhokta vastuon ke udyogon or krishi rin kii kami se jujh rahe hai, arthvyavastha main vibhinn gadabadi or asamanta ke kaaran kul rin main adhiktar bade hisse par ho rahi he ki mahasoos kar sakate hai
 This type of modification of discrepancy is a matter of qualitative debt control
 gunatmak vidhi arthvyavastha main nakadi or rin kii channelizing ke tareeke ko niyantrit karata he
 It seems that depending on the situation, what is known as the 'priority area' spreads as for the other, where there is a 'selective method' of restricted control as a loan for some clause
 is vidhi ke tahat istemaal kiya upkaran hai- Marginal requirement of loan = Present value of security offered for loan value of loan given
 seemaant aavashyaktaa he, un logon ke vyavsaayik gatividhiyon ke liye jiskaa shrey jaataa he arthvyavastha main pratibandhit kiye jane kaa pravaah bad jaataa he
 In case the flow of credit has increased, the marginal requirement will be reduced
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne 1956 ke baad se is paddati kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 Under this method there is a maximum limit for loans and advances, which cannot be exceeded by commercial banks
 vishisht shreniyon ke liye bhartiya rigerv bank fiks chat
 Debt flow is to be checked specifically for speculative activities when used for such ration conditions
 "puunji: kul sampatti" kii nunatam sankhya ne bhi bhartiya rigerv bank dwaara nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he The Reserve Bank of India uses media to publicize its views and its directions on the current state of the market that would be required to be implemented by commercial banks to control the unrest
 is paddati kii vajah se ucch nirakshartaa ko vikasshil deshon main bahut safal nahin he, haalanki yah mushkil logon ko is tarah kii nitiyon or iske nihitarth ko samajhane ke liye kar rahi he maujuuda
 Under the Banking Regulation Act, the central bank refuses to follow the instructions given by the Reserve Bank of India that commercial banks have the right to take strict action against anyone
 aise bainkon par bhartiya rigerv bank dwaara lagaae gaye rin ke aage badhaane par koi pratibandh nahin ho saktaa
 For example, the Reserve Bank of India had imposed some restrictions on the functioning of metropolitan cooperative banks
 iske alaava 'karad ke bank' 1992 main ek ko samaapt karne ke liye aayaa tha
 This method is also being used by the Reserve Bank that the Reserve Bank of India uses here to persuade commercial banks to follow their instructions / orders on the flow of credit, that method as "moral persuasion" Is known in bhartiya rigerv bank apsfiti ke dauraan mudrasphiti ke dauraan rin pravaah par ek chat daal or rin dene main udaar hone ke liye vanijyik bainkon par dabaav daalata he
 By quantitative debt control we mean control over the total amount of debt
 udhaaharan ke liye, america ke kendriya bank, apni gananaa ke aadhaar par rupee samajhataa he ki us par vichaar karte hai
 There is a maximum safe limit for the expansion of 50,000 credits
 lekin samay kii he ki bhi bindu par vaastavik credit rupee he
 55,000
 is prakaar yah to kendriya bank apni nitiyon kas dwaara 50,000 karne ke liye ise neeche laane ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Similarly, if the actual credit is less, say 45,000, then the Reserve Bank regulates its policies in favor of credit pumping in the economy
 is vidhi ke tahat istemaal kiya vibhinn upkarnon hai- The bank rate, also known as the discount rate, is the country's official central bank's minimum rate on which foreign bank is ready to rediscount approved bills or lend on approved securities
 india act 1934 kii rigerv bank kii dhara 49, "yah kharidne ke liye yaa is adhinium ke tahat kharid ke liye bazaar yaa anya vanijyik patr paatr ke bill-chhot ke liye phir se taiyaar kiya jaataa he, jis par maanak dar" ke rup main bank dar ko paribhaashit karata he
 Commercial banks, for example, have invested fast or all its available funds and have little or no cash above the stipulated minimum, the central bank may ask for this money
 yah kendriya bank ke saath yaa to phir se chhot apane bilon kaa kuch kar sakate hai yaa yah apane aap hi vachan note kii jamaanat ke khilaaf kendriya bank se udhaar le saktaa he
 In either case, the central bank accommodates the commercial bank and the latter increases the cash reserves
 arthvyavastha main mudra kii aapurti niyantrit ho gaya he jab is dar mudrasphiti ke samay ke dauraan vruddhi hui he
 At any time there are different rates of interest ruling in the market, like the rate of loans, deposit rate of commercial banks, market discount rate and so on
 kendriya bank mudra bazaar ke netaa or antim upaay ke rindaata he lekin jab se, al anya daron baariki se bank dar se sambandhit hai
 Changes in bank rates are, therefore, followed by changes in all other rates in the form of money markets
 credit control saamaanya rup se vitt nideshak yaa jokhim prabandhan samiti ko report karne or bechney kii prakriya ek sambhavit graahak yaa credit linon badaye jane ke liye anurodh kar sakate hai nakad bhugtan karata he, jo bhi ek maujuuda graahak ke dauraan jari karne ke liye prakriyaaon
 The following procedure can be followed at this point: - 1
 aupchaarik patr ek graahak ikai ko diya gaya ho vitt 2
vitt vibhaag ke pramukh anurodh credit kaa moolyankan karata he3
credit vartmaan jokhim portpholio ke saath main feet baithta he, to jokhim prabandhakon kaa moolyankan4

 5
 External rating agencies can be applied to assess the risk associated with lending to the customer
 aam taur par ek form kii rin paatrata aise daan or broadstreat, bloomberg, asi nilsan yaa anya sammanit companiyon ke rup main companiyon dwaara swatantra rup se moolyankan kiya ja saktaa he
 6
 Fillers are also made in the market to assess the credibility of a firm7
 An internal assessment considers the risk of bad or doubtful debts against profits or returns
 8
 jokhim prabandhak or vitt nideshak santusht hone ke baad rin kaa vistaar principal kii haani main parinaam nahin hoga
 Loan is given! 9
 An account is opened with a loan setting set to the agreed terms - the customer will enjoy the credit cap and the words or duration that they will enjoy the credit
 duusare shabdon main samay-seemaa ke saath hi credit kaa mulya ek hi sikke ke pahalu hai

 Should the invoice arise a dispute should be placed to support the statement of account

 7
 If the customer does not pay on time, then a call is made to follow the credit
 credit ek vyapaar main vikaas ko protsaahit karne ke liye jari kiya ja saktaa he
 Internal growth generated, customer loyalty programs ensure that the business increases sales revenue
 credit bhi pratiyogita main anya kshetron kii tulana main majboot he, jahaan bazaar main pravesh karne ke liye ek vyapaar ranneeti ke hisse ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Although not a business strategy to issue credits on their own accord! anuchit rin company par ek gambhir tanaav ho saktaa he or company kii vifaltaa ke liye le ja saktaa he
 Many smes have failed in unsatisfactory debt collection processes or procedures

 Upon entering the atmosphere, it gets an ion system

 By this action, most of the Sun's ultraviolet rays are absorbed into the Earth's atmosphere

 Under normal conditions, the amount of ultraviolet rays reaching the surface of the Earth is in the range of tolerance of humans or organisms

 ' aisi manyata he ki chhath parv par vrath karne vaali mahilaon ko putr ratna kii prapti hoti he
 In general, women keep this fast for the want of a son and for the skill of the son
 purush bhi puri nishtha se apane manovanchit kaary ko safal hone ke liye vrath rakhte hai
 Chhath festival is basically a festival of worship of the sun, which has a special place in Hinduism
 hindu dharm ke devataaon main surya aise devtaa hai jinhen moort rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 The main sources of Sun's powers are his wife Usha and Pratyusha
 chhath main surya ke saath-saath donon shaktiyon kii sanyukt aradhana hoti he
 In the morning, both the first rays of the sun and the last rays of the sun in the evening are paid by offering arghya
 bharat main suryopasna rug vaidic kaal se hoti aa rahi he
 The Sun and its worship are discussed in detail in Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Brahma Vaivarta Purana etc
 madhya kaal tak chhath suryopasna ke vyavasthit parv ke rup main pratishthit ho gaya, jo abhi tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 Due to the creation and rearing power, the worship of the sun started in different form at different places with the development of civilization, but the worship of the sun as a deity is first mentioned in the Rigveda
 iske baad anya sabhi vedon ke saath hi upanishad aadi vaidic granthon main isaki charchaa pramukhataa se hui he
 Yasak, the creator of Nirukta, has placed the Sun in the first place among the local gods
 uttar vaidic kaal ke antim kalkhand main surya ke maanviya rup kii kalpana hone lagi
 It later took the form of idol worship of the sun
 puranic kaal aate-aate surya puja kaa prachlan or adhik ho gaya
 Temples of Suryadev were also built in many places
 puranic kaal main surya ko aarogy devtaa bhi mana jane laga tha
 The rays of the sun were found to have the ability to destroy many diseases
 rishi-muniyon ne apane anusandhan ke kram main kisi khaas din iskaa prabhaav vishesh paaya
 Probably this is the birth of Chhath festival
 bhagwaan krishna ke pautra shamb ko kusht rog ho gaya tha
 Special Suryopasana was done to get rid of this disease, for which Brahmins were called from Shakya Island
 chhath puja kii parampara or uske mahatva kaa pratipaadan karne vaali anek puranic or lok kathaayen prachlit hai
 According to a belief, Lord Rama and Mother Sita fasted and worshiped Suryadev on Kartik Shukla Shashthi on the day of the establishment of Ram Rajya after the Lanka victory
 saptami ko suryoday ke samay punah anushthan kar suryadev se aashirwad praapt kiya tha
 According to another belief, Chhath festival started in the Mahabharata period
 sabase pehle suryaputra karn ne suryadev kii puja shuru kii
 Karna was the supreme devotee of Lord Surya
 vah pratidin ghanton qamar tak pani main khade hokar suryadev ko arghya dete the
 He became a great warrior by the grace of Suryadev
 aaj bhi chhath main arghya daan kii yahi paddati prachlit he
 Some stories also mention the worship of the Sun by Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas

 According to a legend, King Priyavad had no children, then Maharishi Kashyapa made a son's sacrifice and offered his wife Malini a pudding made for Yagyahuti

 Priyavad went to the crematorium with a son and his son started dying in isolation
 usee vakt brahmaji kii maanas kanya devsena prakat hui or kaha ki sristi kii mul pravriti ke chathe ansh se utpann hone ke kaaran main shashthee kehalaati hoon
 Hey! Rajan, you should worship me and inspire people to worship as well

 This festival, full of devotion and spirituality, spreads the sweetness of folk life, consisting of bamboo-made soup, baskets, earthen pots, sugarcane juice, prasad made from jaggery, rice and wheat and sweet folk songs
 shastron se alag yah jan saamaanya dwaara apane reeti-rivaajon ke rangon main gadhi gayi upasna paddati he
 At its center is the peasant and rural life rather than scriptures like Vedas, Puranas
 is vrath ke liye na vishesh dhan kii aavashyaktaa he na purohit yaa guru ke abhyarthna kii
 If needed, it is the support of the neighborhood which is presented with pleasure and gratitude for its service
 is utsav ke liye janata swayan apane samuhik abhiyaan sangathit karti he
 The society does not look for the help of the government for the cleanliness of the cities, the management of the passing paths of the vratas, the proper arrangement of arghya donations on the banks of the pond or river
 is utsav main kharnaa ke utsav se lekar ardhyadaan tak samaaj kii anivaary upasthiti bani rahati he
 It is a monumental and grand performance of the collective work done by the common and poor people, forgetting the difficulties of their daily life, with service and devotion
 lokparv chhath ke vibhinn avasaron par jaise prasad banaate samay, kharnaa ke samay, arghya dene ke liye jate hue, arghya daan ke samay or ghat se ghar lautate samay anekon sumdhur or bhakthi-bhav se purna loakgeet gaaye jate hai
 This song mentions a parrot that is hovering near one such banana bunch
 tote ko daraaya jaataa he ki agar tum is par chonch maaroge to tumhaari shikaayat bhagwaan surya se kar di jaaegi jo tumhen nahin maaf karenge, par phir bhi tota kele ko jutha kar detaa he or surya ke coup kaa bhaagi banataa he
 But what should her Indian Sugani do now, poor thing? How to bear this disconnection? Now Suryadev cannot help him, he has destroyed the sanctity of worship

 Similarly, in 1979, an expert committee of the World Health Organization did not like the use of the term alcoholism in view of its clinical status and preferred it to be classified as "alcohol dependence syndrome"
 In the 19th and early 20th centuries, alcohol dependence, before the practice of the term "alcoholism" or drunkenness, was called alcoholism
 baharhaal, madyavyasanita ko jaivik prakriya kaa samarthan anishchit he, haalanki iske jokhim kaarak saamaajik vaataavaran, tanaav, maansik swasthya, anuvanshik pravriti, umr, jaateey samooh or sex hai

 Alcoholism is the cyclic presence of tolerance, withdrawal and excessive intake of alcohol; The drinker is unable to control compulsive drinking despite being aware of the harm to him or her health, indicating that the person may be an alcoholic

 he said: udhaaharan ke liye, dil kii beemaari jaisi koi cheez nahin hoti he
 Rather, it has many different types of heart or its associated disorders
 madyavyasanita isi tarah kii koi cheez he
 Therefore, we do not want to do anything wrong with the medical profession by calling alcoholism a disease
 isliye ham hameshaa ise rugnataa, yaa vyaadhi kah kar - kahin adhik surakshit shabd kaa upyog karte hai
 In professional and research contexts, the term "alcoholism" sometimes includes both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence
 or ise kabhi-kabhi sharaab par nirbharta ke samaan mana jaataa he
 In psychology and psychiatry, DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, ICD is the standard
 in logon ne jin shabdon kii sifarish kii he, ve ek samaan hai, lekin abhinn nahin hai
