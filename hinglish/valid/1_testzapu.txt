 31 seat list is used as non-reserved open entry list and 69 seats are filled using 69% reservation
 The effective reservation percentage depends on how many non-reserved category students fall in the list of 50 and not in the 31 list
 At one extreme, all 19 may be non-reserved category students, in which case the total reservation becomes 58%; It can also be argued that by considering it as 19% 'reservation' for non-reserved category students it becomes / 119 or 74%! At the other extreme, in the list of 31, no 19 are added to the non-reserved category, then no super-numbered seats will be created in this case and 69% reservation will be done as per the state law order

 Mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas was a renowned sociologist of India
 unhone dakshin bharat main jati tathaa jati pratha, saamaajik starikaran, saanskritikaran tathaa pashchimikaran par kaary kiya
 They presented the concept of 'dominant caste'
 'mysore narsinhachaar shrinivas' ko san 1977 main bharat sarkaar dwaara vigyaan evam abhiyantriki ke kshetra main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 They are from Karnataka
 aupchaarik rup se bhartiya samajashaastra ke aadi-purush bhale hi na hon, lekin swatantra bharat main is anushaasan ko unhone apane saidhantik yogadan, jati kii vilakshan samaj or sahabhaagi prekshan kii paddati ke istemaal se jitna samrudh kiya he vah unhen desh ke shirshatam samaaj-vigyaniyon main shaamil karne ke liye paryaapt he
 In sociology, he is known for his original foundations like Sanskritisation, dominant caste and vote bank
 shrinivas sansthaaon ke nirmaataa bhi the
 He is credited for the establishment of departments of sociology in Baroda and Delhi University
 shodh or adhyayan ke ucchstareey sansthaanon kii sthapana or disha-nirdesan ke lihaaz se bhi bhartiya samajashaastra ke vikaas main unka yogadan kaaljayi mana jayega
 Apart from a specific study of rural community and caste structure, M
N
 Srinivas has also done thought provoking work on topics such as social impact of science, Gandhi's religious thinking, history of anthropology and gender
 shrinivas kaa krititv vastunishth paryvekshan, vishleshan kii maheentaon tathaa saidhantik gaharaai kaa durlabh sangam mana jaataa he
 His writing provides a particular ground context for inter-subjectivity
 shrinivas kii samajashastreey drushti ghatnaon kii bahari banaavat ko bhed kar unhen gadhane vaali sanrachanaon or aitihaasik shaktiyon kii thaah leti he
 His ability to present the nuanced details and insights of community life in simple language gives him a distinct personality from contemporary sociologists
 is arth main ve vishaygat shabdaawalee kaa atikaraman karte hue saadhaaran or prachlit bhashaa ko chunate hai
 It will be called the democracies of his scholarship that his theoretical concepts help in understanding the subject rather than engaging in his own ideas
 shrinivas ne vicharadhara ke str par bhartiya samajashaastra ke liye ek nayi zamin taiyaar kii
 It is worth mentioning that at the time when Srinivas was preparing to study Indian society, American and British academic installations dominated social sciences
 america vishvavidhyalayon main prachlit drushtikon bhartiya upmahadweep ke samaaj ko samajhane ke liye sanskritnishtha paramparaon par jor detaa tha
 As a result, Indian sociologists considered Sanskrit sources and Indology / Indology to be more authentic for the study of contemporary reality
 shrinivas pehle samajashastri the jinhone is varchasvkaari sthiti ko chunauti di
 He proved from his writings that in sociology, the study of the actual activities and activities of society is better than relying on classical references
 shrinivas dwaara prastut prabhutvshaalee jati tathaa samskruthikaran kii avadharanaon kaa raajnneeti vigyaniyon ke alaava itihaas-lekhan kii sabaltern jaisi dhaaraon ke itihaaskaaron ne vyapak prayog kiya gaya he
 In this sense, his work can be placed in the category of an intellectual tradition which has acquired the status of an important reference for new and old scholars
 prasangvash, prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana sankhya bal, bhu-swaamitv, shiksha or naukari jaise karkon ke kaaran kisi jati ke gaanv yaa kshetra vishesh main dabadabe ko jaahir karti he to samskruthikaran nimna jatiyon dwaara ucch jatiyon khaas taur par brahman varg kii samskruti, reeti-rivaazon, bhashaa or veshbhusha aadi ko apnaane kii pravriti ko gyaapit karti he
 Though his third concept vote bank could not make a permanent place in social sciences, the term is used indiscriminately in the daily discourse of politics and media world
 swatantra bharat kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sanrachana ke adhyayan main ye teenon avadharanaayen or usase jude vimarsh tattvik mahatva hasil kar chuke hai
 The concepts of dominant caste and culturalization help in understanding the decisive elements of India's social system and its organizational structure
 haalaanki brahmnavaadi aadarshon kii ghatati vaidhata ke kaaran samskruthikaran kii avadharana ab utani mahatvapurn nahin maani jaati lekin yah tathy he ki beesvin sadi ke ek bade kalkhand or swatantraaa ke baad bhi lambe samay tak samskruthikaran ek kaasi ullekhneey pravriti thi
 In the politics that emerged after the Dalit movement and the Mandal Commission, the trend of Sanskritisation has weakened, but the concept of dominant caste is still seen as an essential tool in analyzing the political processes in rural society in India
 kai samakaleen samajashastri shrinivas ke krititv ko rashtravaadi samajashaastra ke brihattar sandarbh main rakhkar aankane kaa aagrah karte rahe hai
 He says that the urban elite of independent India wanted to continue the project of modernization of colonial rule
 isliye rashtravaadi samajashastriyon ke krititv main chintan or vichaar kii vahi aupniveshik saraniyan sakriy thi jinke aadhaar par british satta apane shashan ko vaid tehraati aayi thi
 These scholars say that the work of sociologists like Srinivas focused on caste and community provides a benchmark for understanding of an all-india Sanskritist Hinduism
 lekin shrinivas kii drushti ko prakat yaa aprakat taur par british yaa america maanavshaastra kii sthapanaaon se nirdeshit bataanaa jaldbaaji kii daleel he jo subooton kii kami ke baavjood aarope patr taiyaar karne kii himakat karti he
 This argument fails to target the tendency of Srinivasa's work in which Srinivas studies the community and also considers the duality of the community and its relations
 shrinivas samajashaastra or maanavshaastra kii buniyadi prasthaapanaaon par bhi thik isi tarah vichaar karte hai
 It is worth noting that Srinivas defines himself as a fellow scholar, as a fellow scholar, whose identity is not different from his subject ie people
 shrinivas jin logon yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karte the unhen ve anya kii shrenee main nahin rakhte the
 In this regard, many British anthropologists have believed that anthropologists studying their society face different kinds of difficulties
 unke anusaar viksit desh kaa maanavshastri ek deshaj maanavshastri ko uski nimnatar sthiti kii ore ishaara karke hameshaa ek khaas saanche main kaid rakhana chahta he
 Srinivas, while clarifying the position of the indigenous anthropologist on this issue, wrote that when an Indian anthropologist studies any caste or other group of India, that caste or group is other for him but at the same time does not ignore this
 It should be done that certain cultural forms, beliefs and values of that caste or group also match the said scholar
 yani aisi sthiti main bhartiya maanavshastri asal main ek tarah se anya main swa kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 In this sense, that caste or group does not remain unfamiliar or other to him because both are connected with the same culture
 shrinivas is sthiti ko asaamaanya dhang se jatil, bahuparti or dwaidhapurna maanate hai
 Looking carefully, Srinivas does not seem to be accused of being a nationalist sociologist given the points of difference and equality with his subject
 vastav main shrinivas is baat par jor dete hai ki adhyayan main aatm or anya kii yah bahulata maanavshastri ke apane samudaay kaa sadsy hone yaa bahari hone kii ekalata se kahin zyaada shreyaskar he
 It is noteworthy that he uses many observations from the Chicago School to study the caste system of the village of Rampura, which was chosen by Srinivas for his research studies
 varna kii prak-british avadharana ko shrinivas kitaabi nazariyaa siddh karte hue yah kehete hai ki yah drushti jati ke gatisheel pakshon ko gaun kar detii he
 Although Srinivas's caste-study focused on the local structure of a village, he was also conscious of the pan-india prevalence of this phenomenon
 apane ek lekh main ve is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki jati nihsandeh ek akhil bhartiya sanrachana he, kyonki desh main har jagah aise samooh dekhe ja sakate hai jo paitrukataa tathaa vaivaahik sambandhon ke aadhaar par ek vishisht samooh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Srinivas also cites traditional employment of these groups in this regard
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki desh main har jagah brahman, achhut, kisaan, dastkaar, vyapaaree or dusron kii seva karne vaali jatiyon kaa astitv dekha ja saktaa he
 In this caste study, Srinivas also mentions regional variations and factors such as western education, administrative jobs, city income, which have had a major impact on the caste structure
 is tarah deergh avadhi ke lihaaj se dekhen to ek samajashastri ke taur par shrinivas ne bhartiya gram or jati kii sanrachana ko aupniveshik dharanaon ke saidhantik varchasv se bhi mukt karaayaa he
 At the same time, he also countered the beliefs of sociologists like Dumon who were proposing that caste differences do not allow the Indian village to become a community
 shrinivas jab gramin samudaay kii sankalpana or gaanvon kii aarthik-saanskrithik antar-nirbharta kii baat karte hai to ve avyakt dhang se akhil bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat bhi karte hai
 Some scholars believe that Srinivas has adopted a Brahminical or upper caste point of view in the study of caste
 lekin is daleel ko sahi kone se dekhen to vah darasal aupniveshik samajashaastra se nikali prathit hoti he
 Srinivas's logic-plan actually exposes the macro and under-concerned perceptions of Western sociologists regarding India's rural communities
 sankshep main kaha jaae to shrinivas kaa krititv pashchimi gyanshastreey prasthaapanaaon, swa, samudaay tathaa raashtra kii dharanaon ke aalochakeey vimarsh main kai buniyadi tark muhaiyaa karaata he

 da second sex simon da bauaar dwaara french main likhi gai pustak he jisane stri sambandhi dharanaon or vimarshon ko gahare taur par prabhavit kiya he
 This book by Simone with feminist ideology presents feminist existentialism effectively
 yah sthapit karti he ki stri janm nahin leti he balki jivan main badhane ke saath banaai jaati he
 His interpretation offers the concept of "second" in keeping with Hegel's thinking
 unki is sankalpana ke anusaar, nari ko uske jivan main uski pasand-naapsand ke anusaar rahanaa or kaam karne kaa haq hona chahie or wo purush se samaaj main aage bad sakati he
 By doing this, she can move forward from stability to pursue her life towards superiority
 aisa karne se nari ko unke jivan main karttavya ke chakravyuuh se nikal kar swatantra jivan kii ore kadam badhaane kaa hausala miltaa hai
 The second gender is an ESI book, which challenges the social, political, and religious rules of Europe, which have always hindered female existence and female progress, and placed women below men
 apni is pustak main main beowaur purushon ke dhakoslon se nari jaati ko lad kar unke jivan main aayi badhaayo par soch na karne kii niti ke vishay main apane vichaar pradaan kiye hai
 It was translated into Hindi as Stree Upekshita
 da second sex asal main le temps modernes ke sheershak se likhi gayi thi, jo june 1949 main chhaapi gayi thi
 The second part of this book was published a few months after the first part was published
 howard parshle ke dwaara angraji main anuwaad ke turant baad hi donon bhaag america main jald hi prakashit kii gayi thi
 Howard proposed to translate on Alfred Knopf's wife, Blanche Knopf
 chunki howard ko french bohot kam maatr main samaj aati thi or darshan-gyaan main unki koi ruchi athwa samaj na hone ke kaaran unhone kaaphi had tak anuwaad kaa kaam galat kiya tha
 He taught biology at Smith College
 kaaphi saalon baad, 2009 main, asal prakashit french pustak kii sathvin saalagirah ke avasar par, donon bhaago kii ek duusari anuvaadit pustak prakashit kii gayi thi
 Beauvoir anticipated her ideology from two different women, Erica Jong and Germain Greer, who supported women's abstinence
 “nari: myth yaa satya” ek aisa adhyay he, jahaan lekhika beovior kahati hai ki kis tarah purush ne samaaj main mahila ko “dusre” kaa darja diya hai
 She says that men have created false rules and laws around women, keeping them in the assurance that men are superior in their place
 lekhika kaa maananaa tha kii aisa karke purush ne striyon kii pareshaaniyon ko samajhane se haath dho liye the or un ke jhuthe dhakoslon ne striyon ko samaaj main hameshaa unke neeche band ke rakhane main unki sahaayta kii hai
 Beauvoir believes that the same pressure has been seen in other parts of the society, for example, in society, fanatical and petty-minded hypocrites have spread many quarrels and discriminations about color, caste, and religion
 par unka maananaa he ki sastri jaati ko jitna samaaj ke itihaas main dabaaya gaya he, vaisaa kisi dharm va jaati ko nahin dabaaya gaya hai
 By keeping women below themselves, hypocritical men have not maintained their high place in society
 apni pustak main beovoir ne aise hi kai vichaaron ko ujagar kii he, jo samaaj kii reet athwa niyamon ko chunauti detii hai
 They have said that women have been considered weak and physically and mentally abnormal and for this reason women have not got proper opportunities anywhere
 nari ko hameshaa yah aashwaasan diya gaya hai ki ve kamazor hai or unhen sthir va saamaanya rahane ke liye purusho ke maarg-darshan par chalanaa chahie
 Before the publication of The Second Sex, there were never any discussions in France about female existentialism, and women never had any complaint about the laws of society
 parantu bauaar ne vichaar dharaa badal daali
 Their female and male caste equality in society draws attention to two issues: One, how physical abnormalities have caused men to rise above and beyond women
 doosraa yah ki kis tarah shaareerik asaamanyataon par bahes va soch-vichaar karne se yah pataa chalata he ki shaareerik asaamanyata asal main prakruti kii kriya he or isamen purusho kaa koi haath nahin
 Therefore, the reason for the physical abnormality causing social inequality in men and women is meaningless and foolish
 yahan beovoir plato ke vichaar dharaa ko nakaarte hue kahati he ki kisi vyakti kaa ling ek ghatana he jisapar us vyakti kaa koi jor nahin hota hai
 Therefore, no distinction should be made between men and women
 nari astitv ke liye beovoir ne kai yogadan kiye hai, parantu phir bhi kabhi beovoir ne swayan ko ek kattar stri adhikaaravaadi nahin kaha
 But Beauvoir did not declare herself a feminist rightist in 1972 after the 1960s and 1970s feminist fronts

 nakad len-dein 2
 single accounting system 3
 doharaa lekha pranali 4
 Indian bookkeeping system is pranali kaa prayog adhiktar gaiyr vyapaarik sansthaaon jaise club, anathalay, pustkaalay tathaa anya samaaj sevi sansthaaon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of these institutions is not to make profit and it only wants to know from the bookkeeping how much cash they have and how much is left and how much is left, only cash book is made under the cash system
 is pustak main saare nakad lendenon ko likhaa jaataa he
 At the end of the year no final account or profit and loss account etc
 is created
 aay-vyay kii sthiti ko samajhane ke liye ek aay-vyay khaataa banaaya jaataa he
 In this method, cash transactions are written in cash book and credit transactions are written in ledger
 yah pranali mukhyatah chote footkar vyapaariyon dwaara prayog kii jaati he
 In this way, keeping books only gives information about the condition of the cash of the merchant, that is, how much cash came and how much is left and how much is left
 kisko kitna dena he tathaa kisase kitna lenaa he, isaki jaankaree khaataa bahi se ho jaati he
 With this method it is not possible to create profit-loss account and economic letter unless this system is converted into a double accounting system
 isliye is pranali ko apurna pranali mana jaataa he
 It is considered the best system of bookkeeping
 is paddati main prayek vyavhaar ke donon roopon kaa lekha kiya jaataa he

 The main objective of financial accounting is to identify, measure, write, transmit financial information as well as record business transactions in the books of accounts in such a way that the operational results of the business for a fixed period can be known and on a fixed date
 Economic status has to be ascertained
 laagat lekhankan laagton ke lekhe karne kii ek aisi prakriya he jo aay va vyay, athwa un aadhaaron ke jin par unka pariklan kiya jaataa he, ke abhilekhan se armbh hoti he tathaa sankhyikeey samankon ke taiyaar hone ke saath hi samaapt ho jaati he
 This accounting method also considers current costs as well as future expenses
 prabandh lekhankan se taatpary lekhankan evam sankhyikeey pravidhiyon kii soochna ko prastut karne evam nirvachan karne ke vishisht uddeshy ke liye prayog se he
 It is designed to bring maximum efficiency to the information managers and to assist in the task of measuring their performance after considering, projecting and coordinating future plans
 agar hamen kisi upkram kii sthirataa, vikaas or laabhadaayakta sunishchit kerani ho to uski maanav sampatti se adhik mahatvapurn anya koi sampatti nahin he
 Its importance can be easily understood when other means of production such as capital, materials, torches, etc
 are all available and workers are not available
 itnaa hote hue bhi is mahatvapurn sampatti kaa lekhankan evam moolyankan aarthik chitthey main kisi bhi prakaar parilakshith nahin hota he
 As a result, the comparison of the economic results of the two firms on the basis of mere capital on appropriation etc
 is incomplete and sometimes misleading
 lekhankan main is kami ko dur karne ke liye maanav sansaadhan moolyankan evam lekhon main darj kar vittiya parinaamon main pradarshit karne kii ek nayi pranali viksit hui he jise maanav sansaadhan lekhankan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to the Human Accounting Accounting Committee of the American Accounting Association, "human resource accounting is the process of identifying human resources, measuring it in the form of data, and organizing this information to the relevant parties
 ’’ If we look at the long-term price situation of the past, one thing is universally clear that the value of every item in the world has generally increased

 Final accounts are also prepared by revaluation

 In the present few decades, the ideology of social responsibility has emerged in business

 It has been assumed that this liability can be met by social obligation accounting, a form of accounting
 chunki vyavsaay utpaadan ke saadhan sthaneey sroton se praapt karnaa he atah paryaavaran main uske kaaran anek hanikaarak parivartan hote hai
 Under social accounting, a business can show the extent to which it has carried out social responsibilities by creating a social profit-loss account and social letter
 lekhankan kaa mul uddeshy sanstha main hit rakhane vaale aantarik tathaa bahya pakshakaron ko aavashyak suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 But what information a party needs, it depends on the nature of interest in his business
 vibhinn pakshakaron kii drushti se aavashyak lekhankan soochna kaa vivechan is prakaar he- Owners arrange funds for the running of the business, hence they want to know that they have appropriated the funds provided by them
 us kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti jaanane ke liye lekhankan suchanaaen chaahate hai
 Such information is provided from time to time by financial statements prepared from accounting records
 duusare se kaary karwaane kii kala hi prabandh he
 Therefore, the management should ensure that its subordinate employees are doing proper work or not
 is sambandh main lekhankan suchanaaen bahut sahaayak hoti hai kyonki isse prabandhak karmchaariyon ke nishpaadan kaa moolyankan kar saktaa he
 Corrective action can be taken by comparing actual performance of employees with pre-determined standards, if actual performance is not of the desired level
 vastav main lekhankan suchanaaen hi prabandh kii vittiya niti, niyojan evam niyantran kaa aadhaar hoti hai
 Appropriators include potential shareholders and long-term lenders
 inkaa hit apane viniyog kii suraksha tathaa us par paryaapt aay praapt karnaa hota he
 They therefore require accounting information to evaluate the past performance of the institution and to explore future prospects, so the employers rely on accounting information included in the financial statements for their investment decisions
 ve jis sanstha main viniyog karnaa chaahate hai, lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par us sanstha kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 Creditors include sellers of goods, bankers and other lenders
 ye rin dene se purv sanstha kii vittiya sthiti jaananaa chaahate hai tathaa is baat se aashwast hona chaahate hai ki sanstha samay par rinon kaa bhugtan kar degi
 In other words, the liquid position of the institution is satisfactory
 sanstha kii taralata sthiti kii jaankaree ke liye inhen chaalu sampattiyon, taral sampattiyon tathaa chaalu dayitvon sambandhi lekhankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo inhen sanstha ke vittiya vivaranon se uplabdh hoti he
 Various government departments and agencies like Company Law Board, Registrar of Companies, Income Tax Department, Wing Market etc
 are also interested in financial information of companies
 in agensiyon kaa uddeshy yah aashwast karnaa hota he ki company ne apane lekhon main kar, labhaansh, hris aadi ke sambandh main adhinium kii vyavasthaaon kaa paalan kiya he athwa nahin tathaa apane laabhon evam vittiya sthiti ko sahi va sachche dhang se prastut kiya he athwa nahin
 The government determines the tax payable capacity of business entities on the basis of information received from the statement of accounts
 ye suchanaaen sarkaar kii bhavi kar niti, utpaadan, mulya niyantran, anudaan, license, aayaat-niryaat niti main di jane vaali suvidhaayen aadi kaa aadhaar hoti he
 The government also requires accounting information of business entities to determine national income
 kabhi kabhi sanstha ke utpaadon kaa mulya nirdhaarit karne ke liye bhi moolyankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki upabhoktaaon evam utpaadakon kaa shoshan na ho sake
 Employees are interested in the economic soundness of the institution as the payment of bonuses depends on the benefits earned
 iske atirikt niyoktaaon or shram sanghon ke bich samuhik saudebaaji lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par hi kii jaati he
 Accounting information, which is said to mirror the financial performance of a business institution, is very valuable to researchers
 ek kaary vishesh kii vittiya kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye shodhakartaaon ko kray, vikray, chaalu sampatti evam daayitv, sthaayee sampattiyaan, dirghakaalin daayitv, swaamiyon ke kosh aadi ke bare main vistrut lekhankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, aisi suchanaaen sanstha dwaara rakhe gayi lekhankan abhilekhon se hi praapt kii ja sakati hai
 Each transaction has two aspects or parties
 khaataa-bahi main prayek paksh kaa ek khaataa banaaya jaataa he
 An account is that part of an ledger in which a collective statement of transactions made in relation to a person, goods or services is written
 is prakaar prayek khate kii sthiti kaa pataa lag jaataa he ki vah khaataa lender he tathaa dendar 
 According to the dual system it is necessary to know the classification of accounts in order to write transactions in sources
 jin khaaton kaa sambandh kisi vishesh vyakti se hota he, ve vyaktigat khate kehalaate hai
 An individual means an individual, firm, company and any other type of business entity
 duusare shabdon main, sab lendaaron tathaa dendaaron ke khate vyaktigat khate hote hai
 From this point of view, the accounts of capital and withdrawal are also personal as these transactions related to the owner of the business are written
 vyapaar ke swami ke vyaktigat khate ko puunji khaataa kaha jaataa he
 Withdrawal account is opened by the business owner to withdraw money from the business
 is prakaar aaharan khaataa bhi vyaktigat khaataa hota he
 Accounts of goods and property are called real accounts
 in khaaton ko vaastavik isliye kaha jaataa he ki inamen varnit vasteen, vishesh sampatti ke rup main vyapaar main prayog kii jaati he
 The merchant can convert his capital into money by selling them when needed
 vaastavik khate aarthik chitthey main sampatti kii tarah dikhaaye jate hai
 Such as machines, buildings, goods, machinery, furniture, cash and banks etc
 are the actual accounts
 in khaaton ko avastavik khate bhi kehete hai
 Business consists of many expenditure items, income items and profit or loss items
 in sabake liye alag-alag khate banate hai jinako ‘nammaatr’ ke khate kehete hai
 They have no tangible basis like personal or real accounts
 udhaaharan ke liye vetan, mazdooree, kamishan, byaaj ityadi ke khate nammaatr ke khate hote hai
 Each transaction has two sides
 rini yaa debit paksh or dhani yaa credit paksh
 For this reason, each account has two parts to write its account
