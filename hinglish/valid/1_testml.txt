 In the year 1951, on the set of the film Tamasha, Meena Kumari met renowned film director Kamal Amrohi, who was looking for a heroine for her next film Anarkali as a producer after the success of the film Mahal
 minaa kaa abhinay dekh ve unhen mukhya nayika ke kirdaar main lene ke liye raji ho gaye
 Unfortunately, on 21 May 1951, Meena Kumari became the victim of a road accident near Mahabaleshwaram, which caused the short finger of her left hand to bend forever
 minaa agle do maah tak bombay ke sasoon aspataal main bhartee raheen or durghatana ke duusare hi din kamaal amrohi unka haalchaal poochne pahunche

 Just after ten o'clock, Dad, unfamiliar with this marriage, brought Meena home
 iske baad donon pati-patni raat-raat bhar baaten karne lage jise ek din ek naukar ne sun liya
 What was just then, Meena Kumari's father started pressuring her to get a divorce
 minaa ne faisla kar liya kii tabatak kamaal ke saath nahin rahengi jabatak pita ko do lakh rupee na de den
 Father Ali Baksha gave filmmaker Mehboob Khan to Mina's dates for his film Amar, but Meena wanted to work in Amarohi's film Daira, husband instead of Amar

 After shooting Amar for 5 days, Meena left the film and went on to shoot Daira

4 Kailhai is a village in Kayamganj, Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh
 veydant gyanayog kii ek shakha he jo vyakti ko gyaan prapti kii disha main utprerit karata he
 Its main source is the Upanishads, which are considered to be the essence of Vedas and Aranyak texts
 upanishad vaidic sahitya kaa antim bhaag he, isiilie isko veydant kehete hai
 The description of rituals and worship is mainly in mantras and Brahmins, knowledge is interpreted in Upanishads
 'veydant' kaa shabdic arth he - 'vedon kaa ant' 
 The three branches of Vedanta that are most well known are: Advaita Vedanta, Specific Advaita and Dvaita
 aadi shankaracharya, ramanuj or shri madhwacharya jinako kramash: in tino shakhaon kaa pravartak mana jaataa he, inke alaava bhi gyanayog kii anya shakhaayen hai
 These branches are known as their promoters, including Bhaskar, Vallabh, Chaitanya, Nimbaraka, Vachaspati Mishra, Sureshwar and Vigyan Bhikshu
 aadhunik kaal main jo pramukh vedanti huye hai unamem ramakrishna paramhans, swami vivekanand, arvind ghosh, swami shivanand raja rammohan roy or raman maharishi ullekhneey hai
 These modern thinkers represent the Advaita Vedanta branch
 duusare vedanto ke pravartakon ne bhi apane vichaaron ko bharat main bhalibhanti prachaarit kiya he parantu bharat ke baahar unhen bahut kam janaa jaataa he
 'vedanta' literally means 'the end of the Vedas'
 armbh main upanishdon ke liye ‘veydant’ shabd kaa prayog hua kintu baad main upanishdon ke siddhanton ko aadhaar maanakar jin vichaaron kaa vikaas hua, unke liye bhi ‘veydant’ shabd kaa prayog hone laga
 Three reasons are often given for the use of the word 'vedanta' for the Upanishads: - acharya udaiveer shastri ke anusaar ‘veydant’ pad kaa taatpary he- It has been said above that the word 'vedanta' was originally used for the Upanishads
 alag-alag samhitaon tathaa unki shakhaon se sambaddh anek upanishad hamen praapt hai
 The main and ancient ones are - Ish, Cane, Kath, Mundak, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka
 in upanishdon ke darshanik siddhanton main kaaphi kuch samanta he kintu anek sthanon par virodh bhi prathit hota he
 Over time, the need was felt that unanimous teachings should be compiled by co-ordinating the ideas which seem to be opposing
 isi aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye baadaraayan vyas ne brahmasutra kii rachana kii jise veydant sutara, sharirakasutra, sharirakamimasaa yaa uttarmimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 In it, the principles of the Upanishads have been compiled very briefly, in formulaic form
 atyadhik sankshep hone ke kaaran sutron main apane aap main aspashtataa he or unhen bina bhashya yaa tikaa ke samajhnaa sambhav nahin he
 That is why many commentators tried to clarify their intentions by their respective languages, but they had their own viewpoints in this explanation and that is why they differ enough
 prayek ne yah siddh karne kii cheshtaa kii ki uskaa bhashya hi brahmasutron ke vaastavik arth kaa spashtikaran karata he
 As a result, all the commentators became promoters of the Vedanta sect
 inamen pramukh he shankar kaa advaitvaad, ramanuj kaa vishishtadvaitvaad, madhv kaa dwaitvaad, nimbark kaa dwaitadvaitvaad tathaa vallabh kaa shuddhadvaitvaad
 Within these languages, there was a series of commentaries on these languages and commentaries on these languages
 apane-apane sampradaay ke mat ko pusht karne ke liye anek swatantra granthon kii bhi rachana hui, jinase veydant kaa sahitya atyant vishaal ho gaya
 Historically, for a teacher to become / understand Acharya, he has to write commentaries or commentaries on the books of Vedanta
 in pustakon main teen mahatvapurn pustak shaamil hai upanishad, bhagavad gita or brahmasutra, jinhen prasthaantrayee kehete hai
 Accordingly, Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Madhvacharya have all given specific compositions on these three important books
 teenon granthon main pragat vichaaron kaa kai tarah se vyaakhyaan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, many opinions regarding Brahm, Jiva and Jagat were presented and in this way many forms of Vedanta were created
 gaudpad tathaa unke anuvarthi aadi shankaracharya brahm ko pradhan maanakar jeev or jagat ko usase abhinn maanate hai
 According to him the element should be devoid of origin and destruction
 nashvan jagat tatvashoonya he, jeev bhi jaisaa dikhaai detaa he vaisaa tatvat: nahin he
 In the awakened and self-awakening, the living organism lives in the world, but in sleep, the living entity remains in a conscious state
 isse siddh hota he ki jeev kaa shuddh rup sushupti jaisaa hona chahie
 The state of sleep is impermanent, so beyond this, Turiyavastha is considered pure form of life
 is avasthaa main nashwar jagat se koi sambandh nahin hota or jeev ko pun: nashwar jagat main pravesh bhi nahin karnaa padataa
 This Turiyavastha derives from practice
 brahm-jeev-jagat main abhed kaa gyaan utpann hone par jagat jeev main tathaa jeev brahm main leen ho jaataa he
 Despite the real imperviousness of the three, the organism considers the world separate from itself due to ignorance
 parantu swapnsansar kii tarah jaagrath sansar bhi jeev kii kalpana he
 The only difference is that the dream is the result of personal imagination, while the awakened experience - the macro - past superconception
 swapnjagat kaa gyaan hone par donon main mithyaatv siddh he
 But like the Buddhists, in Vedanta the creature is not considered false due to being part of the world
 mithyaatv kaa anubhav karanevaala jeev param satya he, use mithyaa maanane par sabhi gyaan ko mithyaa maananaa hoga
 But the form in which an organism behaves in the world is false
 jeev kii turiyavastha bhedagyaan shunya shuddhavastha he
 The relation of the knower-known-knowledge is a false relationship
 inase pare hokar jeev apni shuddh chetnavastha ko praapt hota he
 In this state there is not even a trace of difference because the distinction is in the duality
 isi advait avasthaa ko brahm kehete hai
 The element is infinite, if the second element is also there, then the limit of the first element will be limited and by being limited, that element will be intelligible in which the distinction of knowledge-knowledge-knowledge will be reflected
 anubhav sakshi he ki sabhi gyey vastuen nashwar hai
 Therefore, if we consider the element to be imperishable, then we have to consider it to be invisible, unknowable, pure consciousness
 aise tatv ko maanakar jagat kii anubhuymaan sthiti kaa hamen vivartvaad ke sahaar vyaakhyaan karnaa hoga
 Like the serpent reverberating in the rope, this world is neither true nor discrete
 sat hota to iskaa kabhi naash na hota, asat hota to sukh, du:kha kaa anubhav na hota
 Therefore, the unique unconditional state can be the actual state from the seventh discrete
 upanishdon main neti kahkar isi agyatavastha kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Ignorance is a form of feeling because it leads to the achievement of the existence of an object, it is a form of absence, because its actual form is nothing
 isi agyaan ko jagat kaa kaaran mana jaataa he
 The exact answer to what ignorance has to do with Brahma is difficult, but Brahma in its pure formless ignorance is not without ignorance, somehow he becomes enlightened by eccentric ignorance to be called a virtuous God and thus the universe becomes active
 ishwar ko apane shuddh rup kaa gyaan hota he parantu jeev ko apane brahmroop kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye sadhana ke dwaara brahmibhoot hona padataa he
 On hearing the sermon of 'tattvamsi' from the mouth of the Guru, the creature experiences 'aham Brahmasmi'
 us avasthaa main sampurna jagat ko aatmamay tathaa apane main sampoorn jagat ko dekhtaa he kyonki us samay uske ke atirikt koi tatv nahin hota
 This state is called Turiyavastha or Moksha
 ramanujacharya ne shankar mat ke vipareet yah kaha ki ishwar swatantra tatv he parantu jeev bhi satya he, mithyaa nahin
 These creatures are associated with God
 unka yah sambandh bhi agyaan ke kaaran nahin he, vah vaastavik he
 Even if there is salvation, the organism remains independent
 bhautik jagat or jeev alag alag rup se satya hai parantu ishwar kii satyata inaki satyata se vilakshan he
 Brahma is complete, the world is rooted, the creature is surrounded by ignorance and sorrow
 ye teenon milakar ekaakaar ho jate hai kyonki jagat or jeev brahm ke sharir hai or brahm inaki aatma tathaa niyantaa he
 They do not exist apart from Brahma, they are only there to serve Brahma
 is darshan main advait kii jagah bahutv kii kalpana he parantu brahm anek main ekta sthapit karanevaala ek tatv he
 Due to the rendering of the unique Advaha Brahman by the plurality, it is called the Vividhavaita
 vishishtadvait mat main bhedarahit gyaan asambhav mana gaya he
 That is why Shankar's pure Adva Brahm is not acceptable in this view
 brahm savishesh he or uski visheshta isamen he ki usamen sabhi sat gun vidyaman hai
 Therefore, Brahma is actually a physical God
 sabhi vaiyaktik atmaaen satya hai or inhen se brahm kaa sharir nirmit he
 It does not dissolve in Brahma, on salvation
 Their existence remains intact
 is tarah brahm anekta main ekta sthapit karanevaala sutara he
 This Brahm is situated in the causal form with the subtle and spirits in the Holocaust period, but takes a subtle physical form in the universe
 yahi kaary brahm kaha jaataa he
 The Brahman with infinite knowledge and bliss is called Narayana who resides in Baikuntha along with Lakshmi
 bhakthi ke dwaara is narayan ke sameep pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The best devotion derives from Narayana's offerings and is Bhagavad Gyanamaya
 bhakthi maarg main jati-varna-gat bhed kaa sthaan nahin he
 This is the highway to God for all
 madhv ne dwait veydant kaa prachaar kiya jisamen paanch bhedon ko aadhaar mana jaataa he- jeev ishwar, jeev jeev, jeev jagat, ishwar jagat, jagat jagat
 The distinction among them is proven automatically
 bhed ke bina vastu kii sthiti asambhav he
 The world and creatures are separate from God but controlled by God

 Saint Peter died in Rome, from which the Bishop of Rome began to be considered the head of the Church

 Notwithstanding all this, today, more than half of Christians around the world are members of the Roman Catholic Church

 The original meaning of Kathlik is broad
 katholic carch kaa daawa he ki vah yugaugantar tak arthath 'sab samay' 'sabhi deshon' ke manushyon ke liye khulaa rahata he or isa dwaara prakat kii gai 'sabhi' dharmik sachchaaiyaan sikhalaataa he

 yah gaur-talab baat he ki yadhyapi "carch" shabd kaa arth "girizaa" hota he, "catholic carch" kaa arth "sampoorn catholic dharmik samudaay" bhi hota he
 Catholics believe that their religious organization continues the custom of the early Christian organization and is its sole heir
 ve maanate hai ki unki prarthana ritiyon main jo roti or madiraa kaa paan kiya jaataa he vah dharmik arth main isa messiah kaa maas or rakt ban jate hai jinhen prarthana karne vaale grahan karte hai
 This is not the case with Protestants

 visheshgy ko apane nishkarsh sabit karne ke liye vaigyanik maapdand kii aavashyaktaa padati he, jisase vah apni baat kii sachai sabit kar saktaa he
 On the basis of such certified things, the court can decide in its favor and punish someone
 nyaayalay hi yah sunishchit karata he kii visheshgy dwaara diya gaya pramaan mananeey he yaa nahin
 Apart from the court, only experts from the same field can express a different opinion on the judgment of the expert

 Andersen observed that by applying magnetic fields in the Wilson cell, taking photos of space rays, two paths, such as electrons, often have their curvature in opposite directions
 vakrata kan ke aavesh par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore it is clear from these experiments that the charge of these particles will be inverted
 ab pozitron kaa astitv anya pareekshanon se bhi sthapit ho chukaa he
 Four years before Positron's experimental invention, Dirac gave an equation that described all the known properties of the electron, but it was also necessary to assume a particle whose covariance and energy were negative
 yah baat ajeeb thi
 To avoid this undesirable situation, Dirac proposed that generally all states of negative energy are filled with electrons
 at: ham dhanatmak urja kii avasthaaon ko hi dekh pate hai
 But sometimes when strong, interactions occur by the electromagnetic field, an electron comes out of the states of negative energy and comes out and behaves like a positive energy electron
 par saath hi rin urjawali ek avasthaa khaali ho jaati he
 We can illustrate this with a hole in a sea of negative energy
 yah chhidr aise hi aacharan karata he jaise dhan aveshwala kan, jisaki sanhati electron ke baraabar ho
 At first Dirac tried to consider this particle to be a proton, but when Andersen's result was discovered, he considered the particle not a proton, but a positron
 dirack kaa chhidr siddhant bahut santoshjanak nahin he
 The modern theory of electrons and positrons relies on the second quantization of the Dirac equation
 isamen pozitron ke gundharm prakritik vidhi se nikal aate hai
 Electrons and positrons can be called 'particles' and 'antimatter'
