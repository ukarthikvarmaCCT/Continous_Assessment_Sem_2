 shaayad hi vishwa ke kisi anya desh main is prakaar kii prakat bhoomi main rashtrawaad kaa udai hua ho
 Sir John Strachey has said about the variations of India that "the first important thing to know about India is that India was never a nation, nor is it, nor does it have any geographical, political, according to European views There was social or religious unity, there was no Indian nation nor any Indian, about which we hear a lot

 british samrajya kii sthapana kaa kaaran mughal samrajya kaa patan or desh kaa anek chote-chote rajyon main vibhajit ho janaa tha
 British rule was different from pre-muslim regimes in many respects
 bhartiya logon kii tulana main angrejon kii rashtriyata kii bhaavana, anushaasan, desh bhakthi or sahyog kahin adhik dikhaai padate the
 Their qualities also influenced the Indian elite
 angreji shashan ke bharat kii aarthik sanrachana par doorgaami prabhaav pade
 This shocked the ancient Asian society in another country and established Western society on the other side
 isse desh main rajnatik ekta kaa nirmaan hua
 Due to its influence, the movement of nationalism developed in the country
 usase desh kii krishi vyavastha me amul chul parivartan hua
 Before the arrival of the British, land was not considered as a king
 use jotanevaale raja ko kar diya karte the, astu bhoomi nijee sampatti bhi nahin maani jaati thi
 With the arrival of the British, the land did not have the right of the rural community, but it became the personal property of the individuals
 is prakaar desh ke kuch bhaagon main jamidaaron or anya bhaagon me kisaanon kaa bhoomi par adhikaar ho gaya
 During the reign of Lord Cornwallis, the zamindar class emerged in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa
 isse gramin arthvyavastha me doorvarti parivartan hue
 In other parts of the country, with the Ryotwadi management, the farmers were given rights over the land they plowed
 sar thomas ne madras ke governor ke rup main san 1820 i0 me raiyatwari vyavastha prarambh kii
 This led to extensive social, political, cultural and psychological changes in the country
 lagaan dene kii nai vyavastha main gramin panchayat nahin balki jameendaar or kisaan sidhe sarkaar ko kar dene lage
 Thus, the agricultural system came into a state of trade and the traditional Indian rural system disintegrated
 kramshah krishi vyavastha kaa roopaantaran hone laga
 With the establishment of private rights on the land, small pieces of land began to grow
 is apkhandan se kheti par bura prabhaav padaa
 The new system of collecting revenue created a new class of government employees

 The economic condition of the country started deteriorating, poverty started increasing
 gaanvon main logon par karj badhane laga, jisase kramshah bhoomi kheti karanevaalon ke haath se nikal kar kheti na karanevaale bhu-swaamiyon ke haath main jane lagi
 This led to the creation of a new class of land-slaves, whose interests were against the interests of the landowners
 krishi ke kshetra me ek ore sarvhaara bhu-das or duusari ore paropjivi jameendaar varg kaa nirmaan hua, jinamein paraspar sangharsh or tanaav badhane laga
 The creation of these classes led to extensive socioeconomic and political changes
 british shasankaal main nagareey arthvyavastha me bhi vyapak parivartan hue
 The cottage industries suffered a setback
 videshi shashan main unke hiton par kutharaghaat hua, unke maal kii khapat kam hoti gai, jisase kramshah paramparaagat udyog samaapt hone lage
 The social status of the artisans began to decline and other occupations started leaving artisanal work
 videshon se aae hue bane-banaaye maal ke muqablon main deshi maal kii khapat ghatane lagi, jiske parinamswaroop bharat adhiktar kaccha maal utpaadan karne kaa strot ban gaya or desh ke bazaar videshi maal se bhare jane lage
 This background is of great importance in the development of modern industries in the country
 angrejon ne apane laabh ke liye desh main yatayaat or sandesh vaahan ke saadhan badhaaye
 He established new industries
 in sabase dhire-dhire rashtriyata kii bhaavana ke vikaas main sahaayta mili
 New people studying English severely criticized the economic policy of the British
 desh me udyogon ke vikaas se poonjipati varg badhane laga
 Most of the Indian industries had foreign capital
 is prakaar desh kii arth-vyavastha desh ke liye hanikaarak or angrejon ke liye laabhadaayak thi, duusari ore vyapaar or udyog ke kshetra main unka ekadhikaar bad gaya
 The British propagated English education to create a class in the country that could assist them in governance
 purv-british bharat main adhiktar shiksha dharmik shiksha thi jo sanskrit paathshaalaon tathaa muslim madrason ke madhyam se di jaati thi
 Christians propagated modern education in the country, although one of the aims of their education was to increase the number of Christians in the country, but it also encouraged Western and modernization processes
 angrejon ne saamaanya shiksha ke atirikt vyavsaayik shiksha dene ke liye bhi vidhyalay khole
 Due to the influence of western education, a special class was created in the country which paid attention to national education
 yah varg shiksha ke mahatva ko bhaleebhanti jaanata tha
 The Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, Aligarh movement also encouraged education
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay or aligarh main muslim vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui
 Dayanand iglo-vedic schools and colleges were established in many places in the country
 angreji shiksha ke prasar se jahaan ek ore kaale angrejon kaa varg badha jo ki keval janm se bhartiya or sab prakaar se angrej the, vahiin duusari ore aise padhe-likhe varg kaa bhi nirmaan hua jo ki desh kii pracheen paramparaon par garv karte the
 These people started the national movement in the country
 bharat main angreji shiksha pranali kii chaahe jo bhi aalochana kii jaae yah nishchit he ki usase desh me rashtriya aandolan kaa sutarapaat hua
 This gave rise to a wave of nationalism, democracy and socialism
 angrejon se pehle bharat main moulik, rajnatik or prashasnic ekta kaa sarvatha abhaav tha
 The British had established a general system of political and administrative terms in the whole country, they established a state of law in their state
 ye kanoon rajya ke prayek naagarik par lagu kiye gaye or inako lagu karne ke liye desh main ek jatil nyaay vyavastha kaa nimarn hua rajya dwaara niyukt nyaayadhish kanoonon kii vyakhya karte the
 And applied the Acts of the State to the citizens
 sampoorn desh main nichali adaalaton, ucch nyaayalayon tathaa sangheey nyaayalayon tathaa council kii sthapana hui
 Which could be appealed to the Privy Council
 is prakaar kanoon reeti-rivaajon par aadhaarit na hokar adhik nishchit ban gaye
 With the establishment of the state of law, the rights of the local panchayats were reduced and uniformity was established in the judicial system
 angrejon ke aane ke pehle ke bharat main or angreji rajya kanoonee vyavastha main baari antar dikhalaai padataa he jabaki purv british kanoon adhiktar dharmik swavrittiyon par aadhaarit tha, british kanoon adhinium or janatantreey mulyon par aadhaarit tha usamen jati varg, prajati varg, ling ke bhedbhaav ke bina rajya ke prayek naagarik ko samaan adhikaar praapt the
 Thus, for the first time in Indian history during the British rule, unity was established among the people of the country on a democratic basis
 kanoonee ekta ke atirikt british shashan main prashasnic ekta kii bhi sthapana hui, nagareey main jisamen soobe kii prashasnic vyavastha samast desh main ek prakaar kii thi
 Due to extensive changes in the system of rent, land-related law and order was established in the country, in which laws were spread all over the country in relation to the sale and sale of land
 aarthik kshetra main british sarkaar ne samast desh main ek se sikke kaa prasar kiya jisamen vyapaar or kray-vikray me abhootpurv vruddhi hui
 During the British rule, new classes emerged with the expansion of new social and economic system and new administrative system and new education
 ye varg pracheen bhartiya samaaj main nahin paae jate the
 These originated from the capitalist system during the British rule
 kintu desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main in nae virgon kaa ek hi prakaar se udai nahin hua
 The reason for this was that English rule was not established simultaneously in different parts of the country and neither reforms were implemented simultaneously
 sabase pehle bengal me angreji shashan kii sthapana hui or vahiin se pehle jameendaar varg utpann hua
 Similarly, in Bengal and Bombay, firstly large industries were established and classes of industrialists and laborers were created there, finally when the British rule was established in the whole country, new social classes started appearing everywhere at the national level
 in nae virgon ke nirmaan me purv british saamaajik va aarthik sanrachana kaa mahatvapurn yogadan tha
 For example, before the arrival of the British, trade and industry was more in the banias and during the British rule also these people first created the capitalist class, due to less spread of education in the Muslim population than Hindus, they had intellectuals, middle class and The bourgeoisie appeared much later than Hindu communities
 is prakaar angreji shasankaal main jameendaar varg, bhoomi jotane vaale, bhuswami varg, krishi shramik, vyapaaree varg, sahuukaar varg, poonjipati varg, madhyam varg, chote vyapaaree or dukandaar varg, doctor, vakil, professor, manager, clerk, aadi vyavsaayee varg or vibhinn kaarkaanon or bagichon main kaam karanevaale shramik varg kaa udai hua
 The interests of many of these classes were against each other and they launched several new movements to protect their interests
 bharat main rashtravaadi vichaardhaara kaa ankur satrahavin shatabdi ke madhya se ugane laga tha kintu yah dhire-dhire viksit hota rahaa ant me 1857 i0 main purna ho gaya
 Therefore, it would be appropriate to consider the period of Indian national awakening as the middle of the nineteenth century
 bharat main rashtrawaad ke janm ke kaaran jo rashtriya aandolan prarambh hua vah vishwa main apane aap main ek anoothaa aandolan tha bharat main raajnneetik jagriti ke saath-saath saamaajik tathaa dharmik jagriti kaa bhi sutarapaat hua
 In fact social and religious awakening resulted in the rise of political awakening
 dow jakaaria kaa mat he ki ”bharat kaa punarjagran mukhyatah aadhyatmik tha
 It initiated many religious and social reforms long before it took the form of the movement of political salvation of the nation
 “ is rup me bhartiya rashtriya jagriti europea deshon main hui rashtriya jagriti se bhinn he
 The following reasons are considered for the rise and destruction of nationalist ideas in India: bharat me rashtriya jagriti paidaa karne me 19 veen shatabdi main hue saamaajik tathaa dharmik aandolanon kaa bahut bada haath rahaa he
 The social and religious conditions of the country were getting worse day by day and superstitions and mischiefs had arisen in the society in the name of religion
 in aandolanon ne ek or dharm tathaa samaaj main vyaapt buraaiyon ko dur karne kaa prayaas kiya to duusari ore bharat main rashtriyata kii bhav bhoomi taiyaar karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Among such movements, Brahma Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission and Theosophical Society, etc
 are particularly notable, whose promoters were Raja Rammohan Roy, Swami Dayanand, Swami Vivekananda, and Mrs
 Annie Besant, respectively
 in sudhaarkon ne bharatiyon main aatmavishvaas jaagrit kiya tathaa unhen bhartiya samskruti kii gaurav garima kaa gyaan karaayaa, unhen apni samskruti kii shreshthata ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Among these great men, Raja Ram Mohan Roy can be called the forerunner of Indian nationality
 unhone samaaj tathaa dharm me vyaapt buraaiyon ko dur karne hetu agast 1828 i0 me brahm samaaj kii sthapana kii
 Raja Ram Mohan Rai tried to remove the evils of sati, discrimination and idol worship in untouchability
 unke prayaso ke kaaran aadhunik bharat kaa nirmaan sambhav ho sakaa
 Hence he is called the creator of modern India
 dow aar0 si0 majumdaar ne likhaa he ki raja ram mohan raay ko bekan tathaa martin lukar jaise prasiddh sudhaarkon kii shrenee main gina ja saktaa he
 AC Sarkar and KK Dutt believe that Raja Ram Mohan Roy started the spiritual era of political awakening and reform of religion in modern India, he was an era promoter
 isliye dow jakaaria ne unhen sudhaarkon kaa aadhyatmik pita kaha he
 Many scholars consider him as the 'father of India' and 'the pioneer of the new era'
 raja rammohan raay ne bharatiyon ke liye raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang kii
 In 1823, newspapers were banned by the Press Ordnance
 is par raja ram mohan raay ne is ardinence kaa prabal virodh kiya or use radd karwaane kaa har sambhav kiya iske pashchaat unhone jeuri act ek aandolan prarambh kar diya
 In the words of Dr
 RC Majumdar, "raja Ram Mohan Roy" was the first Indian who presented the hardships and grievances of his countrymen to the British Government and showed the way for the Indians to organize and run a political movement
he was also credited with being a pioneer of the modern movement
 can be given
 “ Swami Dayanand Saraswati became a great reformer after Raja Rammohun Roy
 jinhone 1875 i0 main bombay main 'arya samaaj' kii neenv rakhi
 Arya Samaj was simultaneously a movement of religious and national renaissance, it gave India and Hindu caste a new life
 swami dayanand ne na keval hindu dharm tathaa samaaj me vyaapt buraaiyon kaa virodh kiya apitu apane deshavaasiyon main rashtriya chetana kaa sanchaar bhi kiya
 He highlighted the shortcomings of Christianity and pointed out the importance of Hinduism and attracted the attention of Indians towards its civilization and culture
 unhone vaidic dharm kii shreshthata ko phir se sthapit kiya or yah bataaya ki hamaari samskruti vishwa kii pracheen evam mahatvapurn samskruti he
 He believes that Vedas are the storehouse of knowledge and is the true Hindu religion in the world, on the strength of which India can become a guru by restoring his reputation in the world
 swami dayanand saraswati ne apane granth 'satyarth prakaash' main nirbhiktapurvak likhaa he HB Sharda has written that- shrimati ani bessent ne likhaa he- Swami Vivekananda propagated Indian culture in Europe and America
 unhone angrejon ko yah bataa diya ki bhartiya samskruti pashchimi samskruti se mahaan he or ve bahut kuch bhartiya samskruti se sikh sakate hai
 Thus he awakened the cultural consciousness in India and inspired the people here to achieve cultural victory
 is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye bharat kaa swatantra hona aavashyak he
 Thus he supported the political independence of Indians which gave extraordinary strength to national sentiments
 bhagini nivedita ke anusaar swami vivekananda bharat kaa naam lekar jite the
 He was an ardent devotee of the motherland and taught Indian youth to worship him
 thiosophical socity kii netaa shrimati ani bessent ne bhartiya rashtrawaad ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Mrs
 Annie Besant was a foreign woman, when Indians heard the praise of Hinduism through her mouth, she could not live without being impressed
 jab unhen apni samskruti kii shreshthata kaa gyaan hua to unhone angrejon ke viruddh swadhinata kii prapti hetu aandolan armbh kar diya
 The gist is that 19th century reformers created a national awakening in the Indian public
 unhone aisa vaataavaran taiyaar kiya jiske kaaran bharat swatantrata ke lakshya ko praapt kar sakaa
 a
 R
 Desai has written in this regard that these movements were less struggle for greater freedom and social equality and their ultimate goal was nationalism
 1707 i0 ke baad bharat main raajnneetik ekta kaa lop ho chukaa tha kintu angrejon ke samay lagbhag sampoorn bharat kaa prashasan ek kendriya satta ke adheen aa gaya tha
 The same laws and rules were implemented throughout the empire
 samast bharat par british sarkaar kaa shashan hone se bharat ekta ke sutara me bandh gaya
 Thus political unity was established in the country
 yatayaat ke sadhano tathaa angreji shiksha ne is ekta kii neenv ko or adhik thos bana diya jisase rashtriya aandolan ko bal mila
 Thus, India became a form of politics
 dow ke0ve0 punnia ke shabdon main ”himalay se kanyakumari tak sampoorn bharat ek sarkaar ke adheen tha or isane janata main raajnneetik ekta ko janm diya
 " videshi vidwaanon kii khojon ne bhi bharatiyon kii rashtriya bhaawanaaon ko bal pradaan kiya
 Sir William Jones, maxmuller, in anusandhanon ne bharatiyon ke man main ek nayaa gyaan or utsaah jaagrit kiya
 This raised a question in his mind that why are we under control? According to Dr
 RC Majumdar's statement, "this discovery could not fail to generate consciousness in the minds of Indians, as a result of which their hearts were filled with nationalism and patriotism
" " shri ke em paanikkar likhte he ki in aitihaasik anusandhan ne bharatiyon main aatmavishvaas jaagrit kiya or unhen apni sabhyataa or samskruti par garv karnaa sikhalaayaa
 With these discoveries, Indians became optimistic about their future
 bhartiya rashtriyadhara main pashchimi shiksha ne saraahneey yogadan diya
 In 1825, on the suggestion of Lord Macaulay, English was the medium of instruction in India
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy bharat kii rashtriya chetana ko jad se nasht karnaa tha
 Rajni Pam Dutt has rightly written, "the purpose of introducing western education by British rule in India was to completely eradicate Indian civilization and culture and to create a class which is Indian by blood and color, But interest should become English with thoughts and words
 " is uddeshy main angrejon ko kaaphi seemaa tak safalataa bhi praapt hui, kyoki shikshit bhartiya log apni samskruti ko bhulakar paashchaatya samskruti kaa gungan karne lage
 But western education benefited India more than the loss
 isse bharat main rashtriya chetana jaagrit hui atah drushti se paashchaatya shiksha bharat ke liye ek vardaan siddh hui
 Due to knowledge of English language, Indian scholars studied the literature of Western countries
 jab unhone milton, bark, harbart spencer, jaan stuard mil aadi vichaarkon kii kritiyon kaa gyaan praapt hua, to uname swatantrata kii bhaavana jaagrit hui
 AR describing the impact of Western education on Indians
 Desai writes that "educated Indians read about the freedom struggles of America, Italy and Ireland
" unhone aise lekhakon kii rachanaaon kaa anushilan kiya, jinhone vyaktigat or rashtriya swadhinata ke siddhanton kaa prachaar kiya he
 These educated Indians became political and intellectual leaders of India's national movement
 " is sambandh main yah smaraneey he ki raja ram mohan raay, dada bhai nauroji, firoz shah mehta, gopal krishna gokhale, umesh chandra banerjee aadi netaa angreji shiksha kii hi dein hai
 The attitude of Indian leaders developed due to English education
 ucch shiksha praapt karne ke liye anek bhartiya igland gaye or vahaan ke swatantra vaataavaran se bahut prabhavit hue
 After coming to India, he encouraged the national movement because he wanted freedom in his country like European countries
 shri gurmukh nihalasinh likhte he ki "igland main rahane se unhen swatantra raajnneetik sansthaaon kii kaarividhi kaa vishisht gyaan praapt ho jaataa tha, ve swatantrata or swadhinata kaa mulya samaj jate the tathaa unke man me jami hui daastaa kii manovriti ghar kar jaati thi
 " angreji bhashaa lagu hone se purv bharat ke vibhinn praanton main bhinn-bhinn bhashaayen boli jaati thi
 So they could not understand each other's thoughts
 sampoorn bharat ke liye ek sampark bhashaa kii aavashyaktaa thi, jise angrej sarkaar ne angreji bhashaa lagukar puraa kar diya
 Now the residents of different provinces started thinking ideas among themselves and this inspired them to work together for the nation
 parinamswaroop rashtriya aandolan ko bal mila
 According to Sir Henry Cotton, "education through English medium and western civilization, despite the variations of the Indian people, served to bind the thread of unity
 ekta paidaa karanevaala anya koi tatva sambhav nahin tha, kyonki boli kaa bhram ek avichhin baadha thi
 Mr
 KM Panikkar writes, "the whole nation's education system and medium of education had such an impact on the mood of Indians that it was not difficult to have a cohesion of their thoughts, feelings and feelings
 parinamswaroop bhartiya rashtriyata kii bhaavana din pratidin prabal hoti gai
 " saransh yah he ki paashchaatya shiksha bharat ke liye vardaan siddh hui
 Dr
 Zakaria has rightly written, "the British started education in India more than 125 years ago, they have not done anything more beneficial in India
 “ isliye praayah yah kaha jaataa he ki bhartiya rashtriyata kii bhaavana pashchimi shiksha kaa poshan shishu tha
 In this way, Western education brought new life into the Indian national consciousness
 lard maikale ne 1833 i0 main kaha, ”angreji itihaas me vah garv kaa din haaga jab paashchaatya gyaan se shikshit bhartiya paashchaatya sansthaaon kii maang karenge
 “he never imagined that his dream would come true so soon
 munro ne likhaa he, ek swatantra press or videshi raaj ek duusare ke viruddh hai or ye donon ek saath nahin chal sakate
 This is true in Indian newspapers
 rashtriya aandolan kii pragati tathaa vikaas main bhartiya sahitya tathaa samachar patron kaa bhi kaaphi haath tha
 Through them, the nationalist elements continued to get strong inspiration and encouragement
 un dinon bharat main vibhinn bhashaaon main samachar patr prakashit hote the, jinamein raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang kii jaati thi
 In addition, the British government's repressive policy was also strongly criticized

 According to Phillips, in 1871 AD, there were 62 newspapers in the native language, Bombay Presidency and North India, and 28 and 20 newspapers in Bengal and South India respectively, with a regular readership of one lakh
 1877 i0 tak desh main prakashit honevaale samachar patron kii sankhya 644 tak ja pahaunchi thi, jinamein adhiktar deshi bhashaaon ke the
 The unjust policy of the British Government was severely criticized in these newspapers, so that a feeling of disgust and displeasure towards the British rule would arise among the common people
 isse rashtriya aandolan ko bal miltaa tha
 To curb the growing influence of these letters, the British Government passed the 'vernacular Press Act' in 1878, by which Indian newspapers were completely destroyed
 is act ne bhi rashtriya aandolan kii lahar ko tej kar diya
 Indian writers also contributed significantly in awakening the spirit of the country
 shri bankimachandra chatarji ne ‘vandemaataram’ ke rup me deshavaasiyon ko rashtriya gaan diya
 This awakened the feelings of patriotism among Indians
 marathi sahitya main shivaji kaa mughalon ke viruddh sangharsh videshi satta ke viruddh sangharsh bataaya gaya
 Mr
 Hemachandra Banerjee encouraged the spirit of freedom through his national songs
 shri bipin chandra paal likhte he, ”rashtriya prem tathaa jaateey swabhimaan ko jaagrit karne main shri hemachandra dwaara rachit kavitaayen anya kaviyon kii aisi kavitaaon main kahin adhik prabhavotpadak thi
 “similarly Keshav Chandra Sen, Rabindra Nath Tagore, RC Dutt, Ranade, Dada Bhai Naoroji etc
 awakened the national spirit in India through their scholarly literature
 indra vidya vachaspati ke anusaar, isi samay micel madhusudan dutt ne bengal main, bharatendu harishchandr ne hindi main, narmad ne gujarati main, chiplunkar ne marathi main, bharti ne tamil main tathaa anya anek sahityakaron ne vibhinn bhashaaon main rashtriyata kii bhaavana se paripurna utkrisht sahitya kaa sajrun kiya
 These literary works have created an extraordinary enthusiasm for improvement and awakening in the hearts of Indians

 “this thing comes true on Indian nationality
 british sarkaar kii aarthik shoshan kii niti ne bhartiya udyogon ko bilkul nasht kar diya tha
 The British had complete authority over the trade here
 bhartiya vastuon par jo baahar jaati thi, baari kar laga diya gaya or bharat main aanevaale maal par british sarkaar ne aayaat par bahut chhot de di
 Apart from this, the British used to take raw materials from India, send goods manufactured by machines from England to India, which was much cheaper than the manufactured goods of small and cottage industries
 parinamswaroop bhartiya bazaar european maal se bhar gaye evam kutir udyog dhandhon kaa patan ho jane se karodon kii sankhya main log berozegaar ho gaye
 India's wealth was going abroad, so India became poorer day by day

 Sudden splits of famines made his situation more pathetic
 wiliam hanter ne likhaa he, ”british samrajya main raiyat hi sabase adhik dayaneey he, kyonki unke maalik hi unke prati anyaayi he
 "in Fisher's words" millions of Indians are living on half-stomach food
 bharatiyon ke shoshan ke bare main di0i0 vaachaa ne likhaa he, ”bharatiyon kii aarthik sthiti british shashan kaal main adhik bigadi thi
 Four crore Indians had to be content with eating only during the day
 iskaa ek maatr kaaran yah tha ki england bhukhe kisaanon se bhi kar praapt karata tha tathaa vahaan par apana maal bhejkar laabh kamata tha
 The summary is that there was discontent among the Indian public against the economic exploitation of the British
 vah is shoshan se mukt hona chaahati thi
 Therefore, Indians started participating actively in the national movement
 gurmukh nihaal singh ke shabdon me ”is tathy ko asweekrut nahin kiya ja saktaa ki bigadati aarthik dasha tathaa sarkaar kii raashtra virdohi aarthik niti kaa angrej virdohi vichaardhaara tathaa rashtriya bhaavana ko jagaane main kaaphi haath tha

 According to this policy, they started seeing Indians with hatred
 gurumukh nihaal singh ke anusaar, ”vidroh ke baad bharat main aanevaale angrejon ke mastishk main bharatiyon ke bare main vibhinn dharanaayen hoti thi
 to the then slave figures of the stage, Indians were considered to be animals which were half-human and half-negro, which could only be explained by fear and for which the behavior and hate of terror of Nil and his companions was appropriate
 " After the revolt of 1857, the British reduced contact
 unke nivas sthaan bharatiyon ke nivas sthaan se bilkul alag the
 They used to hate Indians as black people
 hotel, club, park aadi sthanon par angrej bharatiyon ke saath durvyavhaar karte the
 For this reason, the British committed many atrocities on Indians based on the policy of color discrimination
 garret ne is sambandh main likhaa he, "europiyanon kii jati vibhed niti teen mahatvapurn siddhanton par aadhaarit thi
 First, the life of a European is equal to that of many Indians, second, Indians can only understand the language of fear and punishment, and thirdly, Europeans came to India not only from the point of view of public interest but also for personal selfishness
 " In the case of justice also, caste discrimination was given place, different punishment was prescribed for Indians and British for the same crime
 angrejon ne anek bharatiyon kii hatyaayein kar daali, kintu unhen koi dand nahin diya gaya
 In this regard, Morrison wrote, "it is a great truth that cannot be hidden that the incident of killing of Indians by the British is not one or two

 Therefore, she did not want to give government jobs to educated Indians, so she grew discontented
 bharatiyon ko ucch padon vishesh tathaa ‘bharat naagarik seva’ se alag rakhane ke liye vidhiwat prayaas kiye gaye
 The age of entry in this service was 21 years
 isaki pariksha england main angreji bhashaa main hoti thi
 It was very difficult for any Indian to pass such an exam
 iske baavjood bhi agar koi bhartiya safal ho jaataa tha, to use kisi-na-kisi bahaane se naukari main nahin liya jaataa tha
 For example, in 1869, Shri Surendra Nath Banerjee passed the ICS examination but the British Government had removed him from service even after entering service
 isi prakaar 1871 i0 me aravind ghosh ne is pariksha ko paas kar liya
 But he was not appointed, as he was not proficient in horse riding
 british adhikari bharatiyon ko ucch padon se vanchit rakhane ke liye nae-nae bahaane dhundhate the
 In 1871, the age of admission in ICS was reduced from 21 years to 19 years, so that Indians could not participate in this competition
 surendra nath banerjee ne british anyaay kaa virodh karne ke liye 1876 i0 me ‘indian association' kii sthapana kii, kise congress kii purvavarti sanstha kaha ja saktaa he
 Banerjee traveled all over the country to oppose this work and to awaken national public opinion
 isse angrej virdohi aandolan ko protsaahan mila
 Mr
 Banerjee has written in his autobiography that "my affairs caused great indignation in the hearts of Indians, the idea spread that if i were not an Indian, i would not have had to face so many hardships
" “ In the development of traffic and means of communication also contributed significantly to the development of the national movement
 british sarkaar ne desh main relon tathaa sadakon kaa jaal bicha diya
 Postal, telegraph, telephone etc
 were arranged
 iske peeche angrej sarkaar kaa mukhya uddeshy yah tha ki vidroh ko dabaane ke liye angreji senaayen shighrata se bheji ja sakegi, evam dur-dur ke praanton kii soochna sheeghra praapt ho jaaegi
 Indians greatly benefited from this development
 ab unke liye ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par janaa sulabh ho gaya
 The distance between people living in different parts of the country decreased, they started coming closer to each other
 unka aagaamee sampark badhaa or drushtikon vyapak hua
 Newspapers started reaching far-off parts of the country
 rashtravaadiyon kaa milanaa tathaa patr vyavhaar karnaa bhi aasaan ho gaya
 Now they started traveling from one place to another, making the movement more fierce, which awakened the common people
 parinamswaroop ekta kii bhaavana adhik prabal ho gai or rashtriya aandolan ko bal praapt ho gaya
 In the words of Gurmukh Nihal Singh, "these means of communication united the entire nation and transformed geographical unity into a tangible reality
" “ Dr
 R
C
 Majumdar has written that the freedom struggle fought in Europe in the 19th century also influenced the Indian national movement
 france kii 1830 i0 evam 1848 i0 kii kranti ne bharatiyon main balidaan kii bhaavana jaagrit kii
 The independence of Italy and Greece added to their enthusiasm
 ireland bhi angrejon kii paradheenata se mukt hone kaa prayaas kar rahaa tha, isse bhi bhartiya janata kaaphi prabhavit hui
 The political movements of Italy, Germany, Rumania and Servia, the passing of reform laws in England and the freedom struggle of America, etc
 also encouraged Indians and encouraged them
 parinamswaroop ve swadhinata praapt karne ke sangharsh main jute gaye
 The gist is that foreign movements contributed significantly to develop the spirit of patriotism and patriotism among Indians
 lard litan kii pratikriyaavaadi niti ke kaaran rashtriya asantosh armbh hua
 As a result, a sense of nationalism was born in India
 is tathy kii pushti surendra nath bannerjee ke is kathan se hoti he, ”kabhi-kabhi bure shaasha kii raajnneetik pragati ke vikaas main sahaayak siddh hote hai
 Lord Linton sparked a wave of new life in the educated community to that extent
 jo ki kai varshon ke aandolan se sambhav nahin thi
 "lord Linton committed the following atrocities in India: lord litan ke in kaaryon ke parinamswaroop bhartiya janata main british shashan ke prati asantosh bahut ugr ho gaya
 Sir William Baderburn told Blunt "at the end of Lord Lytton's reign the situation had reached the threshold of rebellion
 ” In 1880, Lord Ripton succeeded Lord Lytton as Governor General
 unhone prashasan ke vibhinn kshetron main anek sudhaar kiye
 After this, decided to reform the judicial system
 is samay nyaay ke kshetra main jati vibhed vidyaman tha
 Indian judges did not have the right to hear the prosecution of European criminals, whereas the British judges had this right
 isliye ripan ne apni concil ke vidhi sadsy mi0 si0pi0 ilbert ko is sambandh main ek vishesh vidheyak prastut karne kaa kaha, is par 1883 i0 main ilbert ne ek bill pesh kiya, ise elbert bill kehete hai
 There was a system of giving Indian magistrates the right to hear and punish prosecutions against Europeans
 lekin yah vidheyak ek bheeshan vivaad kaa kaaran ban gaya
 The British living in India considered Ilbert Bill their ethnic insult
 parinamswaroop sampoorn bharat or england main angrejon ne sangathit hokar iskaa virodh kiya tathaa iske viruddh aandolan chalaaya
 He said, "black people will decorate the whites long and keep their women in their house
 ” europiyanon ne is vidheyak ke khilaaf sangathit rup se aandolan chalaane ke liye ‘european raksha sangh’ kii sthapana kii or lagbhag ek lakh pachaas hajaar rupee chandaa ikattha kiya
 Meetings were held at various places to condemn the Bill
 vidheyak kaa virodh charam seemaa par pahunch gaya
 Sir Henry Watton has written in this regard that "some of the British of Calcutta conspired to subdue the rulers of the Government building and bind Lord Ripon and send them back to England, and this all happened in the knowledge of the Governor and Police Commissioner of Bengal" The Ripon had to bow before the organized movement of the US and had to amend this bill
 iske anusaar ab yah nishchit kiya gaya ki bhartiya nyaayadhish tathaa seshan jaj european adhikariyon ke mukaddamon par apana nirnay de sakenge
 But these European officials will be able to demand the jury to sit in their cases
 jisamen kam-se-kam aadhe sadsy european honge
 This amendment ended the original spirit of this bill
 is ghatana ne bhartiya janata ko bahut adhik prabhavit kiya
 In the words of Surendranath Banerjee, “no self-respecting Indian could sit idle blindly now
 jo ilbert vivaad ke mahatva ko samajhate the, unke liye yah desh bhakthi kii mahaan pukaar thi
 In fact, the anti-ilbert Bill movement inspired India to organize
 sar henry katan ke shabdon main “is vidheyak ke virodh main kiye gaye european aandolan ne bharat kii rashtriya vichaardhaara ko jitani ekta pradaan kii utani to vidheyak paarit hokar bhi nahin kar saktaa tha
 "impressed by the movement of Europeans, Indians also decided to set up a national institution
 parinamswaroop congress kii sthapana kaa maarg prashast hua
 The Indians felt that if we too organized like the British and opposed the British government, we could get freedom
 isse rashtriya aandolan ko bal mila
 Mr
 AC Majumdar writes, "this movement also made Indians feel that if political progress is desirable, it is possible only by a national assembly
 is sabha kaa sambandh vibhinn praanton kii swatantra raajnneeti se na hokar desh kii ek vyapak raajnneeti se hi hona chahie
 " rashtrawaad ke janm ke liye kaarnon kaa vishleshan karne se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki bharat main iskaa janm british sarkaar kii nitiyon ke parinamswaroop hua
 Two opposing views of British imperialism emerge in India - evolutionary and reactionary
 lekin in donon hi swaroopon ne rashtrawaad ke janm main sahaayta pradaan kii
 As it is clear from the above description, political unity was established in India only during British rule, Western education spread and the means of transport flourished
 inase yadi ek ore british shashan ko laabh hua to duusari ore apratyakshrup se rashtrawaad ke janm main bhi yogadan mila
 If the developing form of British rule contributed indirectly to the birth of nationalism, then its reactionary form accelerated this process
 british shashan dwaara bharat kaa aarthik shoshan, bharatiyon ke saath bhed-bhav, unhen sarkari naukariyon main sthaan na milanaa, press kaa galaa ghotna, hathiyaar rakhane yaa lekar chalane par roak lagaana
 Works like fighting a war for the expansion of imperialism made it clear that British rule was not in India's interest

 jalchakr yaa jal tarabine ve ghurni ingine hai jo bahati hui jalarashi main nihit gatij urja ko yantric kaary main parivartit kar dete hai
 Their modern development took place in the 19th century and they were used extensively for industrial power before the arrival of the power grid
 vartmaan samay main inkaa upyog mukhyatah bijli paidaa karne ke liye hota he
 Watermills are made in various ways but there are very simple types of tips which have been used since prehistoric times to produce power
 samay samay par aavashyaktaaon tathaa paristhitiyon se prerit hokar logon ne inamen anek sudhaar kiye, at: jal tarabine bhi panchakki kaa hi viksit rup he
 Since the first half of the twentieth century, their use has increased so much that many hydro-electric power houses have been built by them in almost all civilized countries
 is kaaran sudur jalheen dehaton main bhi bade saste bhav par bijli praapt hone lagi or naanaa prakaar ke udyog dhandhon ke vikaas ko pratsaahan mila
 The principles on which these plants are designed are applicable in all types of first-hand driving devices
 jal raashi main nihit sthitij urja kaa gatij urja main parivartan kaise hota he, ise sankshep main samajhane ke liye kalpana kiijie ki kuch oonchaai par sthit ek tank main se pani kii ek dhara usee ke neeche sthit jalashay main gir rahi he
 Per kilogram of water filled in this tank, some joule potential energy is contained due to the height
 jab yah pani neeche girtaa he tab neeche girte samay, yah sthitij urja kramash: gatij urja main parivartit hone lagati he or jab vah dhara nichevale jalashay kii jalatal rekha par pahunchati he tab uski samast sthitij urja gatij urja main parinat ho chukti he
 While reaching this water level, if one kilogram of water has a velocity of v meter per second, it will have 0
5 V2 joules of kinetic energy
 yadi tank kii oonchaai h meter maan len to tank ke prati kilogram pani main g
h jul sthitij urja hogi
 So on reaching the bottom
 sthitij urja kii haani = gatij urja kii prapti, arthath ab jyon hi vah pani jalashay main pravisht hoga, uske pani main vikshobh utpann ho jayega or phir thodi der main shant bhi ho jaayga
 In this example, the kinetic energy contained in the water coming from above was wasted by creating disturbances in the water of the reservoir and no useful work could be done from it
 yadi vahi pani ek nal main se hokar neeche aata to vah us nal ke muhane par daab utpann kar kisi jalchakr athwa ingine ko chalaa saktaa tha
 Whenever a place is thought to produce power by running a hydropower motor or turbine with the help of the energy received by the flow of water or the dominion, it is in the first place a reasonably accurate estimate of the energy received from the surrounding watershed or water source
 Is applied
 jal chakkiyon kaa itihaas kaaphi purana he
 Also, water has been used as energy for a long time
 yahaan tak ki rome vaasi kabhi ek tarah kii tarabine jal chakkiyon ko krishi ke liye prayog main laate the
 In this way turbine is a naturally developed technology of water wheel
 haalanki, jab tak audyogic kranti nahin hui thi, tab tak aadhunik tarabine kaa vikaas nahin hua tha
 Historically, it was used in big factories in the 19th century
 yah vargeekaran nimnlikhit prakaar he : These chakras run when the flow of the water is obstructed, due to the impact of the collision or due to the load of water in the chakras
 jaldhara ke pravaah tathaa gurutvkarshan janit urja se chalanevaale chakron kaa upyog to ab dehaton main kutir udyogon ke upyukt hi samajha jaataa he, visheshkar un pahari praanton main jahaan nirantar jharne behate rahete hai
 In this type of cycles, the upstream, ponsley, diaphragm and upstream cycles are prominent, but they are considered completely unsuitable for large amounts of electrification, yet the use of the upstream cycle, in large power stations, as an auxiliary motor, is required
 When done, the tax is done with modern plants
 is prakaar ke chakra kii kaaryakshmata lagbhag 25 pratishat hi hone paati he, kyonki isamen pani kii bahut si urja vyarth main nasht ho jaati he
 It was used a lot till 1,800 AD
 yah ardhapravahee chakra kaa hi parishkrut rup he
 Its petals are folded in such a way that water enters them without any shock and when exiting them, it passes only in the tangential direction of the circle's circumference, which gets more impulse to the chakra and The efficiency of the cycle almost doubles
 yah bhi ad:pravaahee chakra kaa hi parishkrut rup he
 The water in its conical petals begins to fill in the petals, located at some height from the plane of the axis of the wheel, and is filled with them until they come down
 chakra kii khol bhi is pani ko unamem bharaa rakhane main kuch sahaayta karti he, at: yah chakra mukhyatya pani ke bhaar ke kaaran hi ghumta he
 There are also two types of diaphragmatic cycles
 ek to madhyocch pravaahee, jaisaa uparyukt varnit chitra main dikhaaya gaya he or doosraa ad:madhyapravahee kehalaata he
 The water in its petals begins to fill in some of the petals below the floor of the spindle, using both water loads and flow-related energies
 in chakron kii kaaryakshmata 50 prati shat se lekar 80 prati shat tak ho sakati he, jo inaki banaavat tathaa aakaar par nirbhar karti he
 They continued in use until the middle of the 19th century, then ceased

 They are driven by the kinetic energy of a highly moving base of water coming out of a tung
 is prakaar ke aavegchakron kaa vahiin upyog hota he jahaan par pani kii maatra to simit hoti he lekin uskaa varchas 300 se 3,000 foot tak unchaa hota he
 Modern types of impulse cycles are sophisticated forms of Ponsley's downstream cycles
 inamen sloos maarg ke sthaan par tudon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jinamein se pani kii pradhar bade beg se nikalakar chakra kii pankhudiyon se takaraati he
 The plant that is most widely promoted in this manner is known as the Pelton cycle]]
 dolchi ko do judwaan pyaalon ke rup main is prakaar bana diya gaya he ki pani kii pradhar uske madhya main takaraate hi fatkar, do bhaagon main vibhakt hokar, ek duusari se lagbhag 180 degree ke konantar par chalane lagati he
 If both of these sub-systems flow in exactly the opposite direction from their original, then the efficiency of the Pelton cycle must be 100 per cent, but they are deliberately skewed, so that they do not collide with their near pole
 aisa karne se avashya hi kuch urja gharshan main barabaad ho jaati he, jisase is chakra kii kaary-kshamta lagbhag 80 pratishat hi rah jaati he
 When entering these pools, the velocity of water is much higher than at the exit
 at: baahar kii taraf unka rasta kramash: chaudaa kar diya jaataa he
 In the USA, this turbine is manufactured under the name 'victor High Pressure Turbine', with efficiency ranging from 70 percent to 80 percent, according to its design and size
 isamen pani kii gatij urja tathaa daab donon kaa hi upyog hota he
 They are planted only where the conditions are opposite to those stated for impulse cycles and impulse turbines, ie, where water can be obtained in small quantities even though it is less dominated
 is pani kaa varchas 5 se lekar 500 foot tak ho saktaa he
 Reaction turbine] principle is explained in the article of steam turbine
 aavegchakra main to pani kii gatyaatmak urja hi kaam karti he, lekin abhikriyaatmak chakra main gayaatmak tathaa daabajanit donon hi prakaar kii urjaayen sammilit rup se kaam karti hai
 Must have seen a sprinkling of water in the gardens
 skanch mil or varker milen isi siddhant par banaai gai thim, jo aadim prakaar kii abhikriyaatmak tarabine thi
 Reactive turbines can be divided into the following four main classes according to the direction of water flow - foorneron naamak ek francisi ejeeniyar ne barker mil ke siddhantanusaar kedriya jalmaarg se baahar kii taraf traigy disha main bahane ke liye maardarshak tundon ko to sthir prakaar kaa banaakar, unke baahar kii taraf ghoomanevaala pankhudiyukt chakra banaaya, ] It has a central chamber, in which water enters and goes out in a radial direction in a circle marked f and rotates the wings marked in the circle
 isamen gha kendriya dhura he, jisase dianemo aadi sambandhit rahata he
 This is a sample of a radius outflow turbine
 ] It was designed by a well-known American engineer named JB Francis
 isamen tontiyon main se pani baahar kii ore se traigy disha main pravisht hokar, bheetar kii ore centre ke nikat ghoomanevaale pankhons ko dhakelkar chalaata hua, neeche ko dhuree ke chaaron taraf hota hua, baahar nikal jaataa he
 a rotating wheel of turbines with droplets or wings at its periphery is called a 'runner'
 tarabinon kaa yahi pramukh avyav he jisaki uttam banaavat tathaa santulan par unki kaaryakshmata tathaa shakti nirbhar karti he
 Two types of turbines are often more useful, one being the radial endocrine reactive and the other the impulsive
 pratham prakaar main se fransis kii tarabine he, jo 100 se lekar 500 foot tak ke varchasyukt jal ke upyukt he
 600 feet of water can also be used with them if needed
 aavegatmak tarabinon ke liye peltan kii dohari dolchiyon se yukt dhavanchak he, jisaki dolchiyon kii akritiyaan dirghavrittajeey prishth yukt hai tathaa bahari kinare thode thod kate hue hai
 In this, the water gets flushed out completely without pushing it, and due to the cut edge, the power of the shield does not get detached while starting
 mishrapravahee tarabinon kaa dhavanchakra fransis kii tarabinon kaa hi parishkrut rup he
 It is designed to get faster speed and more power from water of lesser dominance
 yantrashastra ke niyamanusaar teevr gati ke liye dhavanchakra kaa vyas kam karnaa padataa he, lekin aisa karne se uski shakti kam ho jaati he; at: is dosha ko mitaane ke liye iskaa vyas kam karke bhi chaudaai badha di gai he or pankhons kii sankhya kam karke unhen centre ke nikat kar diya gaya he
 They can be used with water ranging from 5 to 150 feet
 dhavanchakron kii kshamta unki lakshanik chaal dwaara janchi jaati he
 If we shorten and shrink the various measurements of a running wheel so that it starts to rotate so much per minute with one foot dominated water that it gets one horsepower, then that number of rounds is called the characteristic speed of that cycle
 ye ab bhi thodi maatra main shakti utpaadan karne ke liye dehati kshetron main prayukt hote hai
 The diameter of their single circle is made up to 60 feet and its width is kept so that it can run 3,000 cubic feet of water per minute
 ye paryaapt mand gati se chalaa karte hai, at: inhen puure kaa puraa ispaat kii chaadaron tathaa bele hue chhadon se banaaya jaataa he
 Teeth are made on the inner circumferences of the chakras, from which a small tooth wheel attached to one side moves the instruments through its respective axis
 inke kendriya mukhya dhure se yantra praaia: nahin chalaae jate, kyonki unpar marod bal bahut adhik padakar unke chhootane kii ashanka utpann kar detaa he
 The theoretical horsepower of any water turbine can be known by the ratio of the weight of water falling on it per minute and the product of the height from which it falls
 udhaahrant: yadi sloos maarg dwaara prati second tarabine par aanevaale pani kaa aaytan v ghan meter ho, pani kaa ghanatv d ho or us pani kaa varchas h meter ho to uski saidhantik shakti V

 iske vipareet iskaa upyog kisi anya mashin ko chalaane ke liye aavashyak shakti ke nirdhaaran ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Dynamometers are generally of two types, absorption and transmission dynamometers
 avasorana dynamometer main maapneey shakti ko koi gharshan tatv yaa vidyujjanitr avashoshit ore apakirn karata he
 a transmission dynamometer is one in which the dynamometer itself absorbs little power or does not absorb at all, but is helpful in coupling the first conductor and its load together
 avasorana dynamometer anek prakaar ke hote hai or inke antargat proni brake, jal brake or vidyut dynamometer hai
 Prawn brake - The prawn brake block used to measure the power located in a rotating lashing is of the order and is used to demonstrate the stopping action of other friction brakes
 dravchaalit brake main pyaale or pattiyon se yukt ek ghurnan aise hi pyaalon se sajjit sthata ke nikat ghurnan karata he
 The accelerated liquid collides with the settling cups and radiates its kinetic energy, whose pulsating response is measured

 vidyut dynamometer main ek janitr hota he, jisamen sthata kii balghurna pratikriya naapi jaati he or vidyut urja ke vyayan ke sadhano kii bhi vyavastha hoti he
 The vortex current brake is another type of brake in which the electromagnetic system is rotated in metallic position
 dhatvik sthata main bhavar dharaayen utpann hoti hai or inamen pratirodh hone se vidyudurja ooshmaa main parinat hoti he
 This includes everything from simple structure leash and carousel design to the complex bar dynamometer used in the measurement of the pulsation transmitted by the propellant lashing of the vessel
 balghurna maapan ke liye dand dynamometer main dand ke pratyasth anthan visthaapan kaa upyog kiya jaataa he Traction or argon-lashing-traction dynamometers are sometimes used for vehicle and vessel testing
 ye naukarshan sanyojak bhaag hai, jinamein kamaani sadrush, yaa dravchaalit, belgayukt avyav hote hai
 Measured forces are measured by the displacement of the elastic segmental force or the pressure exerted by it
 in balamaapnon or pot yaa yaan ke vegamapan kaa prayog karke shakti nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 The essential component of many transmission dynamometers is a segregation, whose deformation indirectly measures the force passing through the segregation
 anek prakaar kii kamanion ke aakaar main parivartan vyavahaarat: bal ke anupaat main hota he, kintu is sambandh ko prayogat: hi nirdhaarit karnaa chahie
 Used to measure traction resistance of trains, a dynamometer mounted in a car is actually a developed form of Morin instrument
 train par ingine dwaara prayukt karshan ek kamaani se paarit hota he
 The segmental deflection, with the help of components - reaches a pencil, working on a drum driven continuously from the axle of the car

 This wheel is used to measure the distance traveled
 upkaran se praaia: morin chakti ore belan samakalni sambhddha hoti he, jisamen yatrakaal me kiya hua kaary padhaa ja sake
 Determining the change in segmental size of segmental dynamometers, designed to measure transmitted power, is more complicated because the entire apparatus, including segmental rotates

 inke upar e patta rakhaa jaataa he, jiske si nahin hote, taaki yadi kamaani ke aakaar main parivartan da dand se ghirani main pareshit baladhurna kaa anupaati hota he
 To measure this, the direction pulleys are placed in the traps, which are guided by geometric slides
 inamen se ek ghirani maapni or duusari suchi kaa vahan karti he
 Every part of the force transmitter has an elastic deformation, which can be measured and measured indirectly by force
 bal or vikruti kaa sambandh nirdhaarit karne ke liye yantric, prakaashiya or telephoneey yuktiyon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Using these measurements and the exact elasticity multiplier of the substance, the engine is punished as well as the propellant transmitted, horsepower and mechanical efficiency of large marine equipment
 yantra ke anshon kii pratyasth vikruti ke preranon dwaara pareshit shakti nirdhaarit karne kii vidhi visheshat: terbine injanon ke liye laabh prad he
 In the thring-hopkinson spasm scale, cramps are observed between adjacent points on the propellant
 belanaakaar sleeve ek sire par dand se jakadi or duusare par mukt hoti he, taaki sleeve ke mukt sire or dand ke bich anthan kii saapeksh gati ho
 Taking advantage of this relative motion, a mirror angular displacement is given, which reflects light coming from a certain source on a fixed scale and strikes a object on the scale in each orbit
 veg saadharna hone par, ruk-rukkar banate hue bimb aankhon ko lagaataar dikhaayi padate hai
 Therefore, on the ruler, convulsions relative to the ends of the lashing equal to the length of the sleeve are continuously indicated
 balghurna kii vruddhi ke anthan or darpan kaa koniya visthaapan badhata he or maapni taatkaalik anthan ke pariman kaa sanket karti he
 The convulsions can be calculated from convulsions
 moulin anthan maapi main dand kii nirdhaarit lambaai ke saapeksh anthan, dand par chadhe hue or uske saath ghurnan karti hui kundali ke swapreran ko, parivartit karti he
 The alternating current is delivered to the coil by couches and sliding rings

 It is related to the spasm of the penultimate punishment, and therefore also to the strong of the punishment
 chaalan pattee ke chaalak or deele parshv main tanaav ke antar, ke aadhaar par pareshan dynamometer bane hai
 When gearing a lashing, the resulting pressure between the teeth of the wheel and the pitch of the wheel bound to the lashing are multiplied by the radius of the wheel circle
 vidyut motor ke armechar par kaary karne vaale balghurna ke saath samaan or viparit ek balghurna dhaanche par kaary karata he
 Therefore, if the structure of the motor is such that it is free to rotate and is not allowed to rotate using force, then it measures the force of the used armature armature
 is sthiti main motor ke kaary ko pareshit karne kii dar ashwashakti he, jisamen armechar kii prati second parikramaon kii sankhya he

 ek din aditya kaaya ko bahut saare paise ek netaa ke paas le jane ke liye detaa he, jisase usko vyapaar main phayda ho

 That night she is surprised to see that mark in Saurav's shoulder

 panini sanskrit ke sabase prasiddh tathaa sammanit vaiyaakaran huye hai
 His book Ashtadhyayi is the most prestigious book in Sanskrit grammar
 panini ke purvavarti vaiyakarnon main yask, shakatayan, shaunak, shaakalya, sphotayan aadi huye hai
 Subsequent grammars of Panini include Katyayan Muni, Patanjali Muni etc
 katyayan muni ne lagbhag 350 i pus main tippanee rup main vaarthik likhe
 After that, Patanjali Muni wrote a commentary on the Ashtadhyayi named Mahabhashya around 150 BC
 vyakaran shaastra main panini, katyayan tathaa pantajali ko trimuni athwa munitray kaha gaya he
 Apart from this, Vamana and Jayaditya jointly composed Kashikavriti around 600 AD

 stegnographi, gupt sandesh kuch is tareeqe se likhane kii kala or vigyaan he ki preshak or abhisht praptakarta ke alaava kisi or ko sandesh ke astitv ke bare main andeh nahin hota, jo ki aspashtataa ke madhyam se ek suraksha he
 The term steganography is originally from the Greek language, meaning "hidden writing"
 The first recorded use of the term is found in his book Steganographia by Johannes Trithemius in 1499, which was a dissertation on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book of magic
 aam taur par, sandesh kuch or tarah se maujuud rahete hai: chitra, lekh, shopping suchiyaan, yaa kuch anya sah-paath or, adarsh rup se, gupt sandesh, ek nijee patr ke drishy linon ke bich adrishy syaahi main ho saktaa he
 The advantage of steganography compared to cryptography alone is that the messages do not attract attention
 Clearly encrypted messages — no matter how unbreakable — will arouse suspicion and be implicated in countries where encryption is illegal
 isliye, kryptography jahaan ek sandesh kii saamagree ko surakshit rakhata he, stegnographi ko sandesh or samvaad karne vaale pakshakaar, donon kaa rakshak kaha ja saktaa he
 Steganography also involves the concealment of information within computer files
 digital stegnographi main, electronic sanchaar ke andar dastaveji fil, chhavi fil, program yaa protocol jaise ek parivahan parat ke andar stegnographic sanket-paddati shaamil ho sakati he
 Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission due to their large size
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ke rup main, ek preshak ek ahaanikar image fil ke saath shuruuaat kar saktaa he or har 100wein pixel ke rang ko varnmaala ke akshar ke anuroop samyojit kar saktaa he, jahaan badlaav itnaa sookshm ho saktaa he ki use dhyanpurvak naa dekhne vaale kii nazar us par padane kii sambhaavna nahin rahati
 The first recorded use of steganography dates back to 440 BC
 , When Herodotus referred to two examples of steganography in The Hysteris of Herodotus
 dimrets ne madhumakhi dwaara utpaadit mom ke falak ko mom kii takhti par lagane se pehle, uski lakdi ke prishthadhan par sidhe likh kar, greece par hone vaale bhavi hamale ke bare main chetavanee bheji thi
 In those days the wax plank was commonly used as a reusable writing page, sometimes used for shorthand
 ek anya pracheen udhaaharan he histyius kaa, jisane apane sabase bharosemand das ke sir ko mundaaya or us par ek sandesh ko goda
 uske bal ugane ke baad sandesh chhip gaya
 Its purpose was to provoke rebellion against the Persians
 stegnographi kaa haal ke aitihaasik or vartmaan kaal main vyapak rup se istemaal hota rahaa he
 The possible permutations are endless and known examples include: santhaapit stegnographi samasyaon ke liye personal computer ke istemaal ke aagaman ke saath hi, 1985 main aadhunik stegnographi ne duniya main pravesh kiya
 Growth was slow after that, but given the number of 'stego' programs available, the situation seems to be improving now: more than 725 digital steganography applications have been identified by the Steganography Analysis and Research Center
 digital stegnographi takneekon main shaamil hai: Digital steganography output can be in the form of printed documents
 ek sandesh, sada paath, ek sanketakshar-paath taiyaar karte hue, pehle paaramparik dhang se incrypted ho saktaa he
 Then, an innocuous co-text is somehow modified to be a cipher, resulting in a stago text
 udaahranarth, sandesh chhipaane ke liye aksharakaar, antar, tiphphes, yaa sah-paath kii anya visheshtaon main herpher kiya ja saktaa he
 Only the recipient who knows the technology can receive the message and then decrypt it
 francis bekan ne aisi takanic ke rup main bekan sanketakshar viksit kiya
 In general, more analog to traditional radio and communication technology is used; However, it would be appropriate to give a brief description of some of the words which are particularly visible in the software and are easily confused
 ye digital stegnographic pranaaliyon ke liye adhik praasangik hai
 Payload is data whose transport is desirable
 vaahak sanket, dhara, yaa data fil he, jisamen pelod chipa hua he; iske vipareet "channel " 
 The resulting signal, stream, or data file, in which the payload is encoded, is sometimes specified as a package, stago file, or secret message
 bits, namoonay, yaa anya sanket tatwon kaa pratishat, jo pelod ko badalane ke liye prayukt hota he, use encoding dencity ke rup main janaa jaataa he or aam taur par 0 or 1 ke bich kii ek sankhya ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 In a set of files, files that are likely to contain payloads are called suspects
 yadi suspect ko kisi sankhyikeey vishleshan ke madhyam se pahachaanaa gaya ho, to uskaa hawala candidet ke rup main diya ja saktaa he
 Careful physical testing is required to detect physical steganography, including magnification, developer chemistry, and the use of ultraviolet light

 In an article published in the June 24, 1948 issue of Paper Trade Journal, the technical director of the United Nations Government Press, Morris S
 Kantrowitz describes the development of this paper, the three prototypes of which were named Sensicot, Enlith, and Kotlith

 If the POW tries to write a message in secret, the special paper will render it visible

 a similar strategy was to draw lines from the water-soluble ink on the paper released to the captives, which 'flowed' as soon as they came into contact with the water-based invisible ink
 computing main stegnographic taur par encoded packejon kii khoj stagnoenalysis kehalaati he
 However, the simplest way to locate modified files is to compare them with known originals
 For example, to detect the dynamics of information through graphics on a website, analysts can maintain known-clean copies of these materials and compare them with existing materials on the site
 yah maanate hue ki vaahak ekasmaan hai, antar, pelod kii rachana karenge
 In general, the use of extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult, but not impossible
 jahaan sampeden trutiyaan data ko chhipane kii jagah muhaiyaa karaati he, ucch sampeedan, ankoding ghanatv badhaate hue or aasaani se pataa lagane kii suvidha dete hue pelod chupaane ke liye uplabdh data kii maatra main kami kar detii he
 Steganography is used by some modern printers, including HP and Xerox brand color laser printers
 prayek prishth main chote pile bindu shaamil kiye jate hai
 These dots are barely visible and contain encoded printer serial numbers, as well as date and time stamps
 bada aavaran sandesh chhipe sandesh ke saapeksh hoga, aasaan yahi hoga ki uttarvarti ko chipa den
 Because of this, digital photographs are used to conceal messages in the Internet and other communication media
 yah spasht nahin he ki vastav main saamaanya taur par iskaa kitna istemaal hota he
 For example: In a 24 bit bitmap each pixel will have 8 bits representing each of the three color values
 yadi ham sirf nile par vichaar karen, to nile rang ke 2 8 alag maan honge
 The difference in value between xxrep 8 1 and xxrep 7 1 0 for the intensity of blue color is not likely to be recognized humanly
 isliye, nunatam mahatvapurn bit kaa rang soochna ke alaava kuch or ke liye upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 If we can do this with green and red colors, then for every three pixels we can get one letter of ASCII
 kuch or adhik aupchaarik rup se kaha jaae to, stegnographic encoding ko adhik mushkil se pataa lagane ke uddeshy se banaaya janaa yah sunishchit karne ke liye he ki vaahak pelod ke antarveshan ke kaaran drishy rup se naganya hai; arthath, vaahak ke kolahalapurna tal se parivartan ko pahchaanana mushkil he
 Any medium can be a carrier, but media with large amounts of redundant or compressive information are more appropriate
 soochna ke saidhantik drushtikon se, iskaa matlab he ki channel main sanket dwaara apekshit 'sataha' se adhik kshamta honi chahie, arthath, atirek kaa hona zaruri he
 For a digital image, it may be noise from the imaging element; For digital audio this can be noise from recording techniques or amplification equipment
 saamanytah, electronics jo ek tulyarup sanket ko digitise karte hai, ve thermal shor, fadafadaahat shor or goli ke shor jaise kai shor sroton se peedit hote he
 This noise provides sufficient variation in the received digital information, which can be exploited to cover the hidden data from the noise
