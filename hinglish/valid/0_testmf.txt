 uski utpatti das-swami samaaj main ek aise vigyaan ke rup main hui jisane vastugat jagat tathaa swayan apane vishay main manushya ke gyaan ke sakal yoga ko aikyabaddh kiya tha
 This was completely natural due to the low level of development of knowledge in the early stages of human history
 saamaajik utpaadan ke vikaas or vaigyanik gyaan ke sanchay kii prakriya main bhinn bhinn vigyaan darshanashastra se pruthak hote gayi or darshanashastra ek swatantra vigyaan ke rup main viksit hone laga
 Philosophy was born as a distinct discipline with the need to expand the general view of the world and to develop general principles and rules, to develop rational, rational and rational principles of thinking about reality

 sanathan kaal se hi maanav main jigyaasa or anveshan kii pravriti rahi he

 in jigyaasaaon kaa shaman karne ke liye uske anwarat prayaas kaa hi yah fal he ki ham log itane viksit samaaj main rah rahe hai
 But the ancient sages-sages were neither satisfied with this material prosperity nor had ever attained everlasting joy

 iske vipareet kuch udhaaharan avashya milengen jisamen aacharan shuddhi tathaa manas kii parishuddhta ke aadhaar par paramsatta ke saath saakshaatkaar karne kaa bhi adarsh paaya jaataa he
 But this ideal is oriental and not westernized
 paashchaatya darshanik apane gyaan par jor detaa he or apane gyaan ke anuroop apane charitra kaa sanchaalan karnaa anivaary nahin samajhataa
 The only exceptions are Western mystics and socialist thinkers
 bhartiya darshan main param satta ke saath saakshaatkaar karne kaa doosraa naam hi darshan hai
 According to the Indian tradition, man can have a knowledge of ultimate power
 is prakaar saakshaatkaar ke liye bhakthi gyaan tathaa yoga ke maarg bataae gaye hai
 But philosophical knowledge is said to be different from scientific knowledge
 vaigyanik gyaan praapt karne main aalochay vishay main parivartan karnaa padataa he taaki use apni ichha ke anusaar vash main kiya ja sake or phir uskaa icchit upyog kiya ja sake

 The goal of philosophers was to find out the system of the whole
 jab kabhi prathit hua ki is anveshan main manushya kii buddhi aage ja nahin sakati, to kuch gaun siddhant vivechan ke vishay bane
 In Greece, this happened after Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and in Germany after Kant and Hagel
 yatharthwaad or ndehwaad aise hi siddhant hai
 In this way, the subjects which have been specially discussed in philosophical discussion, these are: mukhya vishay - Minor subjects - in vishyon ko vichaarkon ne apni apni ruchi ke anusaar vividh pakshon se dekha he

 prakruti, rajas tathaa tamas in teen gunonvali he
 Nature is the name of the equilibrium of qualities

 For this reason, nature is called Trigunatmika

 But according to Sankhya, man or soul is multiplied
 yoga ke anusaar ishwar bhi in gunon se pare he
 The experience of all tribulations, worldly bliss etc
 is due to the qualities, so the ultimate goal of yoga is considered to be the nostragunya state

 Their number is 24- sahityashasre main das shabdagun or das hi arthgun maane gaye hai
 The names of the qualities in these two types are the same but there is a difference in their characteristics: Shlasha, Prasad, Samata, Madhurya, Sukumarata, Arthavakti, Generosity, Ojas, Kanti and Samadhi are their names
 shabdagun ke rup main inkaa lakshan sankshep main yon he- Symmetry, the bond that does not have senile
 prasad-gun-yukt rachana main pehle to shithily dikhaai detaa he, baad main gadhata aa jaati he

 jis rachana kaa arth anayas gyaat ho jaataa he use arthvyakti gun se yukt maanate hai
 The composition in which hard characters are absorbed is characterized by generosity
 jis rachana main sanyukt varnon kaa prachurya ho use ojas gun se yukt maanate hai
 The composition with prevailing experiments is radiant, avoiding obsolete terms
 jis rachana main pehle gadh bandha ho or baad main shithilataa ho use samadhi-gun-yukt rachana maanate hai
 This is related to the feature of word input in word formation
 arthgunon kaa sambandh shabd se na hokar rachana ke arth se hota he
 The combined combination of actions of action is syllable
 jitna arth varnaneey ho uske anuroop padon ke prayog se jo arth kii spashtataa hoti he use prasad kehete hai

 The composition in which the rasa is clearly visible is called the Kantingunayukta
 amuk arth kaa varnan pehle nahin hua athwa varnan kisi purvakavi ke varnan kii chaaya he, yah aalochana samadhi kehalaati he
 According to the new literature of Mammatt, Vishwanath, Jagannath etc
 Madhurya, Ojas and Prasad are the three main qualities
 baaki gunon kaa inhen main antarbhaav ho jaataa he
 Some teachers do not accept the semantics
 ye gun ras maatr ke dharm maane gaye hai
 In Sanskrit grammar, 'ar', 'a' and 'o' are called attributes while 'ar', 'ai', and 'au' are increments
 udhaaharan ke liye, maha + ish = mahesh - yah gunasandhi kehalaati he
 Similarly, sun + rise = sunrise is also virtuous
 ayurveda main kisi padaarth ke gun 20 gunon main se koi ek yaa anek hote hai
 These 20 qualities are as follows- nirdeshaank: 27°11′N 78°01′E / 27

 sadish E, D, b or h ke avkalaneey hone ke liye aavashyak he ki madhyam satat ho
 But if two mediums with different electromagnetism and magnetic permeability are found, then the behavior of electromagnetic fields on their interface is as follows- where: n 12 { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {n} _{12}} is normal vector from medium 1 to medium 2
 Hence the tangential component of e is continuous at the interface
 where: n 12 { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {n} _{12}} is normal vector from medium 1 to medium 2
 ρ s { \ displaystyle \ rho _{s}} is the surface charge between the media
 Therefore, the reciprocal component of d at the interface is not continuous, but they have a difference equal to the planar charge density present at the surface surface
 where: n 12 { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {n} _{12}} is normal vector from medium 1 to medium 2
 Hence the reciprocal component of b is constant at the interface
 where: n 12 { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {n} _{12}} is normal vector from medium 1 to medium 2
 j s { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {j} _{s}} is the surface current density between the two media
 Therefore, if the planar current is zero, the tangential component of h at the interface will be continuous

 Related Census Code: State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00722 bhartiya raajnneeti ke anusaar amaatya rajya ke saat angon main doosraa ang he, jiskaa arth he - mantri
 For the King's counselors, 'amatya', 'secretary' and 'minister' - these three words are often used
 inamen amaatya ni:andeh pracheenatam he
 The meaning of the word "amavan" in a mantra of the Rig Veda is "amatyukta"
 vyutpati ke anusaar "amaatya" kaa arth he - 'sarvada saath rahanevaala vyakti' 
 In the Aastambha Dharmasutra, Amatya means minister without doubt, where the king is ordered not to spend the life of the Aishwarya more than his teachers and ministers
 
 The first use of the word "secretary" is found in the Aitareya Brahmin where Marut Indra's "secretary" is stated
 mantriyon kii salaah lenaa raja ke liye nitant aavashyak hota he
 The words of Kautilya, Manu and Matsyapuran are very clear in this subject
 amaatya, sachiv tathaa mantri shabdon kaa paryaay rup main prayog bahulata se uplabdh hota he jisase inke paraspar parthaky kaa pataa thik-thik nahi chalata
 The finance ministers of the Maratha Empire were called Amatya
 maury raja ashok ke vittamantriyon ke mahamatya kaha jaataa tha
 In Junagadhwale of Rudradam, the word Secretary is considered synonymous with Amatya
 sachivon ke do prakaar yahan batalaaye gaye hai: matisachiv tathaa karmschiv 
 According to Amar, the secretary is called Amatya Minister and other than that Amatya is called "karmachakiv"
 parantu yah parthaky anya granthon main nahin paaya jaataa
 According to Kautilya's Arthashastra, the rank of ministers was high and of the ordinary rank of Amatya
 kautilya kaa kahana he amaatyon kaa pareekshan dharm, arth, kaam or bhay ke vishay main achche dhang se karne par yadi ve eemaandaar or shuddh charitravaale siddh hon, tab unako niyukt karnaa chahie; parantu mantriyon ke vishay main unka aagrah he ki jo vyakti samast pareekshanon ke dwaara parakshit hone par rajyabhakt tathaa vishuddhshay pramanit kiya jaae, vahi mantri ke pad ke liye yogya samajha jaataa he
 
 pariksha ke upaay ke nimit prayukt pradhan shabd he-upadha jisaki vyavya "nitivakyamrita' ke anusaar he--dhamarthikambhayeshu vyajen parchittaparikshanm upadha
 The act of advising the king was a personal right of the Brahmin, therefore, Kalidas has given the right to accrue the power of Rajanis disciplined by Brahmin mantras with "pavanagnisamagam"
 amaatya kaa pradhan kaary raja ko bure maarg main jane se bachaana tha or keval raajnneetik baton main hi nahin, pratyut anya aavashyak vishyon main bhi raja kaa mantriyon se paraamarsh karnaa anivaary tha
 He used to consult his ministers in a very secret place, otherwise the secret of mantra and causality would remain in the evil of the nation
 amatyaparishad ke sadasyon kii sankhya ke vishay main pracheen kaal se matbhinnata dikhalaai padati he
 The request of an Acharya is to limit the number of ministers to three-four, but some Acharyas are in favor of increasing it to seven-eight
 ramayana main dasharath ke mantriyon kii sankhya aath di gai he or isi ke tathaa shukranitisar ke aadhaar par chhatrapati shivaji ne apni mantriparishad ashtapradhanon kii banaai thi
 From the examination of the words of Shantiparva, Kautilya and Nithikavakamrit, it can be concluded that in ancient times, there were three types of ministers: amaatyon ke liye aavashyak gunon tathaa yogyata kaa vishesh varnan dharmasutron tathaa smritiyon main kiya gaya he

 Just as this universe does not belong to any one country, caste, religion, energy therapy is also not a heritage of any one

 "energy therapy was first reported to the Asian region, it is believed
 hamaare vedon main, panini sutara main urja chikitsa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 According to the Vedas, energy healing has been named "prana Shakti"
 yah praan shakti "vah" shakti he, jo jeev maatr main satat rup se karyrat he or jiske rup badal lene par sharir kaa kaary karnaa band ho jaataa he
 According to this fact, energy therapy is the form of real Brahman / Prakriti / divine power
 hamaare puraanon, dharmik granthon ityadi main bhi urja chikitsa kaa ullekh miltaa he, jinke anusaar rishi-muni, mahatmagan sadhana ke dwaara samvaahit urja ke dwaara janamanas ke chikitsa or parmarth kaa kaary kiya karte the

 jinke anusaar mahatma buddha or unke kuch khaas shishy apane sankalp shakti or sparsh se bimariyon / pareshaaniyon kaa nidaan karte the
 According to all these authentic vedas-puranas and texts it was considered a secret and spiritual discipline in that period
 jis kaaran aam janata ko is vidya ke bare main jaankaree nahin di jaati thi
 To know this knowledge, the seeker had to do complete penance with his body and mind, and then Mahatma Buddha used to harmonize the seeker
 agar kahin se bhi mahatma buddha ko ye lagata ki abhi "is sadhak" main is divya vidya ko grahan karne ki yogyata nahin aa saki he to us sadhak ko punah sadhana karne kii ajna di jaati thi
 It is not known that this guru-shishya tradition has been maintained by each of the gurus of his era
 is tarah se ati icchhuk sadhak hi is vidya ko grahan kar pate the
 Over time, the disciples of Mahatma Buddha also kept following this rule and gradually the number of seekers receiving this divine education decreased, then there came a time when there was no knowledge of this divine education

 The existence of a rich diversity of unique species across many parts of the world exists simply because they are protected from obstacles, particularly large rivers, seas, seas, mountains, and deserts from other species of other country masses, especially high, ultra fertile, competitive The generalist are separating "super-species"
 These barriers are overcome by natural processes, through many millions of years in the future
 Continental drift can never occur
 But humans have invented ships and airplanes and now have the power to bring in contact that species have never met in their evolutionary history, and on the time-scale of days, centuries that historically accompany major animal migrations Is the opposite

 When alien species are introduced to ecosystems and establish self-sustaining populations, endemic species may not survive in that ecosystem that is not ready to deal with foreign species

 Purebred naturally evolved region specific wild species can be threatened with extinction in a big way through the process of genetic pollution ie uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical and / or fitness advantage of introduced plant or animal
 Nonnative species can bring about previously isolated species in contact, through purposeful introduction by hybridization and introgression about a form of extinction of native plants and animals, either through humans or habitat modification

 Attention has to be focused on the limitation of this under the problem of appreciation that is not always clear
 Morphological observations alone
 To some degree gene flow may be a normal, evolutionarily anatomical process and all constellations occur in genes and genotypes
 However, With or without introgression hybridization may not be preserved, however, a rare species' existence may be threatened

 Due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole

 Chanakya was the general secretary of Chandragupta Maurya
 ve 'kautilya' naam se bhi vikhyath hai
 He was the teacher of Taxila University
 unhone nandavansh kaa naash karke chandragupta maury ko raja banaaya
 Economics composed by him is a great book of politics, economics, agriculture, social policy etc
 arthshaastra mauryalin bhartiya samaaj kaa darpan mana jaataa he
 ], Bhagavata etc
 Puranas and Kathasaritsagar etc
 Sanskrit texts like Chanakya's name have been mentioned, its story is also found in Buddhist texts
 buddhaghosh kii banaai hui vinayapitak kii tikaa tathaa mahanam sthavir rachit mahavansh kii tikaa main chanakya kaa vrittant diya hua he
 Chanakya was a resident of Taxila
 inke jivan kii ghatnaon kaa vishesh sambandh maury chandragupta kii rajyaprapti se he
 He was a famous scholar of that time, no doubt
 kehete hai ki chanakya rajasi thaat-baat se dur ek choti si kutiyaa main rahete the
 a serial was also produced in his name which was shown on Doordarshan in the 1990s
 chadragupta ke saath chanakya kii maitri kii katha is prakaar he- King Nanda or Mahananda of Pataliputra had a yagna here
 usamen chanakya bhi gaye or bhojan ke samay ek pradhan asana par ja baithe
 Maharaj Nanda saw their black color and got them up on the pedestal
 isapar cruddh hokar inhone yah pratigya kii ki jabatak main nandon kaa naash na kar loonga tabatak apni shikha na baandhuunga
 At the same time, Prince Chandragupta was expelled from the kingdom
 chadragupta ne chanakya se mail kiya or donon aadamiyon ne milakar mlechh raja parvatak kii sena lekar patliputra par chadhaai kii or nandon ko yuddh main parrast karke maar daalaa
 There are many types of stories regarding the destruction of the Nandas
 kahin likhaa he ki chanakya ne shakatar ke yahan nirmalya bheja jise choote hi mahanand or uske putr mar gaye
 Somewhere the story of sending poison is written
 mudrarakshas naatak ke dekhene se janaa jaataa he ki nandon kaa naash karne par bhi mahanand ke mantri rakshas ke kaushal or niti ke kaaran chandragupta ko magadh kaa singhaasana praapt karne main badi badi kathinaaiyaan padin
 In the end Chanakya pleased the demon with his prowess and made Chandragupta a minister
 buddha grantho main bhi isi prakaar kii katha he, keval 'mahanand' ke sthaan par 'dhananand' he Although there is a lack of authentic facts regarding Kautilya's life
 unke janmasthan ke sambandh main bhi matbhed paaya jaataa he
 According to some scholars, Kautilya was born in the 'chanak' region of Punjab, while some scholars believe that he was born in South India
 kai vidwaanon kaa yah mat he ki vah kanchipuram kaa rahane vaala dravin brahman tha
 He had come to North India in search of livelihood
 kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar kerala bhi uskaa janm sthaan bataaya jaataa he
 In this regard, the mention of the Charani river is given by him as proof of this
 kuch sandarbhon main yah ullekh miltaa he ki kerala nivasee vishnugupt tirthaton ke liye varanasi aayaa tha, jahaan uski putree kho gayi
 He did not return to Kerala again and settled in Magadha
 is prakaar ke vichaar rakhane vaale vidwaan use kerala ke kutullur namputree vansh kaa vanshaj maanate hai
 Many scholars consider him a native of Magadha
 kuch buddha saahitiyon ne use takshashiksha kaa nivasee bataaya he
 It is difficult to say with certainty where Kautilya's birthplace is because of the extreme differences, but based on many references it would be okay to consider Taxila as his birthplace
 ve
 ke
 subramanyam ne kaha he ki kai sandarbhon main is baat kaa ullekh miltaa he ki sikandar ko apane akraman ke abhiyaan main yuva kautilya se bhent hui thi
 Since Alexander's invasion was mostly in the Taxila region, it is expected that Kautilya's birthplace would have been in the Taxila region
 kautilya ke pita kaa naam chanak tha
 He was a poor Brahmin and lived in some way
 atah spasht he ki kautilya kaa bachapan garibi or dikkaton main gujara hoga
 There is no specific reference to Kautilya's initiation, but his intelligence and his scholarship are reflected in his thoughts
 vah kurup hote hue bhi shaareerik rup se balishtha tha
 An overview of his book 'arthashastra' gives a complete sense of his talent, his multi-faceted personality and foresight
 kautilya ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah bada hi swabhimani evam krodhi swabhaav kaa vyakti tha
 According to a legend, once King Mahananda of Magadha humiliated Kautilya on the occasion of Shraddha
 kautilya ne krodh ke vasheebhoot hokar apni shikha kholkar yah pratigya kii thi ki jab tak vah nandavansh kaa naash nahin kar degaa tab tak vah apni shikha nahin baandhenga
 This was also a major reason for Kautilya's entry into practical politics
 nandavansh ke vinaash ke baad usne chandragupta maury ko rajgaddi par baithne main har sambhav sahaayta kii
 After Chandragupta Maurya ascended the throne, he entered into practical politics with the aim of making him mighty and expanding the Mauryan Empire
 vah chandragupta maury kaa mantri bhi bana
 Many scholars have stated that Kautilya has nowhere said anything in his composition regarding the Mauryan dynasty or his ministry, but most sources have confirmed this fact
 'arthshaastra' main kautilya ne jis vijigishu raja kaa chithran prastut kiya he, nishchit rup se vah chandragupta maury ke liye hi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 Overwhelmed by the defeat of small states due to Alexander's invasion of India, Kautilya resolved to enter practical politics
 uski sarvopari ichha thi bharat ko ek gauravshaalee or vishaal rajya ke rup main dekhnaa
 Certainly Chandragupta Maurya was the focal point of his desire
 acharya kautilya ko ek ore paarangat or doordarshee raajnneetijna ke rup main maury samrajya kaa sansthaapak or sangrakshak mana jaataa he, to duusari ore use samskruti sahitya ke itihaas main apni athulaneey evam adbhut kriti ke kaaran apane vishay kaa ekmaatr vidwaan hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 Kautilya's wisdom, dexterity and foresight is well known in the scriptures, poems and other texts of India
 kautilya dwaara nandavansh kaa vinaash or mauryvansh kii sthapana se sambandhit katha vishnu puraana main aati he
 Despite being a great scholar and general secretary of the Maurya Empire, Kautilya's life was a life of simplicity
 vah 'sada jivan ucch vichaar' kaa sahi pratik tha
 He led a very simple life during his tenure as a minister
 vah ek chota-se makaan main rahata tha or kaha jaataa he ki uske makaan kii deevaaron par gobar ke upale thope rahete the
 He believed that a king or a minister with his character and high ideals could present a model to the people
 usne sadaiv maryaadaaon kaa paalan kiya or karmthata kii jindagi bitaayi
 Later, he is said to have renounced his ministerial career and led a Vanaprastha life
 vastutah use dhan, yash or pad kaa koi lobh nahin tha
 In essence, he was a 'vitiragi', 'ascetic, man of hard work and dignity, whose life is still exemplary
 ek prakand vidwaan tathaa ek gambhir chintak ke rup main kautilya to vikhyath he hi, ek vyaavhaarik evam chatur raajnneetijna ke rup main bhi use khyaati mili he
 He has a historical contribution in the destruction of the Nanda dynasty and the establishment and expansion of the Magadha Empire
 salator ke kathananusaar pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan main kautilya kaa sarvopari sthaan he
 Like Machiavelli, Kautilya has also attempted to separate politics from morality and study it as an independent scripture
 jaisaa ki kaahaa jaataa ha Kautilya's name, date of birth and birthplace have all been the subject of controversy
 kautilya ke naam ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke bich matbhed paaya jaataa he
 The first translator of Kautilya's 'arthashastra', Pandit Shamashastri, has used the name Kautilya
 'kautilya naam' kii pramanikta ko siddh karne ke liye pandit shaamasasthri ne vishnu-puraana kaa hawala diya he jisamen kaha gaya he— a controversy has arisen in this regard and that of Kautilya and Kautilya
 ganpati shastri ne 'kautilya' ke sthaan par 'kautaly' ko zyada pramanik mana he
 According to him, the name Kautalya appears to be correct and consistent due to being a Kutla gotra
 kaamandakeey nitishastra ke antargat kaha gaya he— Sambasiva Shastri has said that Ganapathi Shastri probably used the name Kautilya, considering Kautilya to be a descendant of the ancient saint Kutla, but there is no evidence that Kautilya was of the clan and clan of saint Kutal
 'kotilya' or 'kautaly' naam kaa vivaad or bhi kai vidwaanon ne uthaaya he
 V
A
 Ramaswamy has supported the statement of Ganapathi Shastri
 aadhunik vidwaanon ne donon naamon kaa prayog kiya he
 Western scholars have not given much importance to the controversy between Kautilya and Kautilya
 unke matanusaar is prakaar kii bhranti hijje ke her-pher ke kaaran ho sakati he
 Most Western writers have used the name Kautilya
 bharat main vidwaanon ne donon naamon kaa prayog kiya he, balki zyaadaatar kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Radhakanth's statement in this regard is also particularly notable
 usne apni rachana 'shabdakalpadram' main kaha he Many more names of Kautilya are mentioned
 jisamen chanakya naam prasiddh he
 Many scholars who have called Kautilya as Chanakya are of the opinion that he was called Chanakya because he was the son of Chanak
 duusari ore kuch vidwaanon ke kathananusaar uskaa janm punjab ke chanak kshetra main hua tha, isliye use chanakya kaha gaya he, yadhyapi is sambandh main koi spasht pramaan nahin miltaa he
 One thing is clear that Kautilya and Chanakya are the same person
 uparyukt naamon ke alaava uske or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh miltaa he, jaise vishnugupt
 It is said that his original name was Vishnugupta
 uske pita ne uskaa naam vishnugupt hi rakhaa tha
 Kautilya, Chanakya and Vishnugupta find many references related to the three names, but apart from these three names many other names are mentioned, such as Vatsyayan, Malang, Dravimal, Angul, Varanak, Katyan etc
 Which is the correct name and which is the wrong name, it is a matter of controversy
 parantu adhikansh paashchaatya or bhartiya vidwaanon ne 'arthshaastra' ke lekhak ke rup main kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Some Western scholars have put a question mark on the existence of Kautilya
 vinternij, jolly or kith ke matanusaar kautilya naam pratikatmak he, jo kootneeti kaa pratik he
 His views are supported by Kantilya's absence in his epics by Pantajali
 jolly ne to yahan tak kah daalaa he ki 'arthshaastra' kisi kautilya naamak vyakti kii kriti nahin he
 This is a text composed by another Pandit or Acharya
 shaamasasthri or ganapatishastri donon ne hi paashchaatya vichaarkon ke mat kaa khandan kiya he
 Both of them are convinced that Kautilya had complete existence, even if there is a difference in his names
 vastutah in teenon paashchaatya vidwaanon ke dwaara kautilya kaa astitv ko nakaarne ke liye jo bindu uthaae gaye hai, ve anargal evam mahatvaheen hai
 Western scholars say that Kautilya has not mentioned anywhere that he was an Amatya or a minister during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, hence the writing of that 'arthashastra' cannot be considered
 yah bachakaana tark he
 It is clear from many references to Kautilya that he, with the help of Chandragupta Maurya, destroyed the Nanda dynasty and established the Maurya Empire
 kautilya kii kritiyon ke sambandh main bhi kai vidwaanon ke bich matbhed paaya jaataa he
 There is no definite information available regarding how many works of Kautilya are there
 kautilya kii sabase mahatpurna kriti arthshaastra kii charchaa sarvatra milti he, kintu anya rachanaaon ke sambandh main kuch vishesh ullekh nahin miltaa he
 Kamandaka, a disciple of Chanakya, has written in his treatise called 'nitisara' that Vishnugupta Chanakya extracted the nectar of ethics by churning the Mahomedi of economics from his intellect
 chanakya kaa 'arthshaastra' sanskrit main raajnneeti vishay par ek vilakshan granth he
 Shlokas of its policy are prevalent from house to house
 peeche se logon ne inke niti granthon se gata badhaakar vriddhchanakya, laghuchankya, bodhichanakya aadi kai nitigranth sankalit kar liye
 Chanakya was a scholar of all subjects
 'vishnugupt siddhant' naamak inkaa ek jyotish kaa granth bhi miltaa he
 It is said that he also has a book on Ayurveda called 'vaidyajivan'
 nyaay bhashyakaar vatsyayan or chanakya ko koi koi ek hi maanate hai, par yah bhram he jiskaa mul hemchand kaa yah shloke he: Thus the name of Kautilya has been associated with compositions called Dhatukautilya and Rajneeti
 kuch vidwaanon kaa yah maananaa he ki 'arthshaastra' ke alaava yadi kautilya kii anya rachanaaon kaa ullekh miltaa he, to vah kautilya kii sukhtiyon or kathanon kaa sankalan ho saktaa he
 Kautilya did not say anything explicitly about the origin of the state, but a few coincidental observations make it clear that he was in favor of a social settlement in place of the divine doctrine of the state
 hobbs, lock tathaa ruso kii tarah rajya kii utpatti se purv kii prakritik dasha ko vah araajaktaa kii sangya detaa he
 The state was born when, fed up with the law of 'fishery justice', people chose Manu as their king and agreed to give him one-sixth of their agricultural produce and one-tenth of gold
 iske badale main raja ne unki suraksha tathaa kalyaan kaa uttardaayitv sambhaala
 Kautilya is in favor of the monarchy
 kautilya ne paashchaatya raajnneetik chintakon dwaara pratipaadit rajya ke chaar aavashyak tattvon - bhoomi, jansankhya, sarkaar va samprabhutaa kaa vivaran na dekar rajya ke saat tattvon kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this regard, he does not give a definition of the state, but supports the already existing weekly theory
 kautilya ne rajya kii tulana maanav-sharir se kii he tathaa uske savyav rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 All the elements of the state work like organs of the human body inter-related, interdependent and together
 jansankhya main krishakon, udhyamiyon tathaa aarthik utpaadan main yogadan dene vaali praja sammilit he
 People should be loyal, hardworking and obeying the king's orders
 is prakaar kautilya kaa saptang siddhant rajya ke savyav swaroop kaa nirupan karte hue sabhi ango kii mahatvapurn bhoomika par prakaash daalata he
 Although this theory does not match the modern definition of the state, Kautilya's kingdom has all four elements of the modern state
 janapad bhoomi va jansankhya he, amaatya sarkaar kaa bhav he tathaa swami samprabhutta kaa pratik he
 The importance of the fund is in the administration, development and promotion and the army is necessary for internal peacekeeping and external security
 videshi maamalon main mitra mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he, kintu durg kaa sthaan aadhunik yug main suraksha-pratiraksha ke anya upkarnon ne le liya he
 Following the ancient Indian political thought, Kautilya has also made the concept of monarchy the center of his thinking
 vah loukik maamalon main raja kii shakti ko sarvopari maanata he, parantu karttavyon ke maamalon main vah swayan dharm main bandhaa he
 He is not a lecturer of religion, but a protector
 kautilya ne rajya ko apane aap main saadhy maanate hue saamaajik jivan main use sarvocch sthaan diya he
 The interest of the state is paramount for which at times it even outpaces the principles of morality
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya kaa uddeshy keval shaanti-vyavastha tathaa suraksha sthapit karnaa nahin, varan vyakti ke sarvocch vikaas main yogadan dena he
 According to Kautilya the functions of the state are- vahya shatruon tathaa akramanakariyon se rajya ko surakshit rakhana, aantarik vyavastha nyaay kii raksha tathaa daivi vipattiyon- baadh, bukamp, durbhiksh, aag, mahamari, ghaatak jantuon se praja kii raksha raja ke kaary hai
 Varnashrama Dharma has been emphasized under Swadharma
 yadhyapi kautilya manu kii tarah dharm ko sarvopari maanakar rajya ko dharm ke adheen nahin karata, kintu praja dwaara dharm kaa paalan na kiye jane par raja dharm kaa sangrakshan karata he
 The duty of the king is to establish social justice for the general public
 saamaajik vyavastha kaa samuchit sanchaalan tabhi sanmbhav he, jabaki pita-putr, pati-patni, guru-shishy aadi apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah karen
 In the event of divorce, he emphasizes equal rights of men and women
 strivadh tathaa brahman-hatya ko gambheer aparaadh mana gaya he
 The scope of Kautilya's kingdom is very wide
 vah rajya ko maanav ke bahumukhi vikaas kaa daayitv saunpkar use aadhunik yug kaa kalyankari rajya bana detaa he
 He has given many tasks to the state
 jaise- band, talab va sinchai ke anya sadhano kaa nirmaan, khaanon kaa vikaas, banjar bhoomi kii jutai, pashupaalan, vanyavikas aadi
 Apart from these, public entertainment was under the control of the state
 anathon nirdhanon, apango kii sahaayta, stri sammaan kii raksha, punakhravvaah kii vyavastha aadi bhi rajya ke daayitv the
 Thus Kautilya's kingdom is the ubiquitous state
 jan-kalyaan tathaa achche prashasan kii sthapana uskaa lakshya he, jisamen dharm va naitikta kaa prayog ek saadhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Kautilya says, ek anya sthaan par usne likhaa he
 In this regard, Salletore's statement is, "the only purpose of the state which has power and authority is to increase the happiness of its subjects
" is prakaar kautilya ne ek kalyankari rajya ke kaaryon ko uchit rup main nirdeshit kiya he
 '' kautilya ne na keval rajya ke aantarik kaary, balki vahya kaaryon kii bhi vistaar se charchaa kii he
 In this regard, he discusses foreign policy, international relations and rules of war and peace
 kootneeti ke sambandhon kaa vishleshan karne hetu usne mandal siddhant pratipaadit kiya he- Kautilya described the policy adopted by various states towards other states in his mandala theory
 pracheen kaal main bharat main anek chote-chote rajyon kaa astitv tha
 Powerful kings expanded their empire by war
 rajya kai baar suraksha kii drushti se anya rajyon main samjhauta bhi karte the
 According to Kautilya, a king who expanded his empire through war and conquest should increase the number of friends of his enemies, so that enemies can be kept under control
 duusari ore nirbal rajyon ko shaktishaalee padosi rajyon se satark rahanaa chahie
 They should form a group or 'mandal' to avoid expansionary policy of powerful states in association with states of equal status
 kautilya kaa mandal siddhant bhugolic aadhaar par yah darshata he ki kis prakaar vijay kii ichha rakhane vaale rajya ke padosi desh uske mitra yaa shatru ho sakate hai
 According to this theory, there is a king in the center of the mandal, who is willing to win other states, it is called "vijigishu"
 ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ ke maarg main aane vaala sabase pehla rajya ‘‘ari’’ tathaa shatru se laga hua rajya ‘‘shatru kaa shatru’’ hota he, atah vah vijigeeshu kaa mitra hota he
 Kautilya has also described "moderate" and "indifferent" states, which, despite being powerful, do not participate in the strategy
 kautilya kaa yah siddhant yatharthwaad par aadhaarit he, jo yudhon ko anterrashtriya sambandhon kii vaastaviktaa maanakar sandhi va samjhaute dwaara shakti-santulan banane par bal detaa he
 Kautilya has described six types of policies for conducting foreign relations - kautilya ke anusaar raja dwaara in nitiyon kaa prayog rajya ke kalyaan kii drushti se hi kiya janaa chahie
 Kautilya described the four principles of diplomacy with respect to the foreign policy of the state
 kautilya ke anusaar pratham do siddhanton kaa prayog nirbal raajaaon dwaara tathaa antim do siddhanton kaa prayog sabal raajaaon dwaara kiya janaa chahie, kintu uskaa yah bhi mat he ki sam daam se, daam bhed se or bhed dand se shreyaskar he
 Punishment should be used as a last resort, because it also causes damage to oneself
 kautilya ne guptcharon ke prakaaron va kaaryon kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he
 The undercover students could have been as homemakers, ascetics, businessmen and poisoners
 rajdoot bhi guptchar kii bhoomika nibhaate the
 Their task was to convey secret information of the country and abroad to the king
 ye janamat kii sthiti kaa aankalan karne, vidrohiyon par niyantran rakhane tathaa shatru rajya ko nasht karne main yogadan dete the
 Kautilya has suggested to keep the spies satisfied by giving them money and honor by the king
 logo ke jivan main mahapurushon ke vichaaro kaa kaaphi prabhaav hota he
 Chanakya's thoughts have also advanced the lives of many people
 chanakya kii kootneeti or iske sidhanto ke bare main kai pustake likhi gayi he
 There is a large section that reads Chanakya's life and follows it
 chanakya ke vichaaro ko anmol kaha jaataa he
 Chanakya's views are well liked by teachers, politicians and business people
 acharya chanakya kaa gauravshaalee vyaktitv ke bare main padhane se nai urja kaa sanchaar hota he
 Kautilya's thoughts are still inspiring
 yah satya he ki kautilya ne raashtra kii raksha ke liye gupt pranidhiyon ke ek vishaal sanghathan kaa varnan kiya he
 For Shatruksha, there is a law for poisonous, miscellaneous, ceremonial use, abhinaya mantra etc
 unethical and inappropriate measures and for the purpose of this great money expenditure and loss of money have also been declared in accordance with the national policy
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main aisi charchaaon ko dekhakar hi mudrarakshaskaar kavi vishakhadutt chanakya ko kutilamati kaha he or banbhatta ne ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko ‘nirgun’ tathaa ‘atinrushanspryopadeshm’ kahkar nindit batalaaya he
 In a newly available historical work titled 'manjushree Moolakalp', Kautilya has been portrayed as 'durmati', Krodhan and 'papak', the character of Garha
 praachyavidya ke visheshgy anek aadhunik paashchaatya vidwaanon ne bhi uparyukt aniatik vyavasthaaon ko dekhakar kautilya kii tulana europe ke prasiddh lekhak or raajnneetijna mekiyavali se kii he, jisane apni pustak ‘da prince’ main raja ko lakshya-prapti ke liye uchit anuchit sabhi sadhano kaa aashray lene kaa upadesh diya he
 Western scholars, etc
 Western scholars demonstrate the following similarities between Kautilya and Mekiavali: kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main aisi sadrushta dikhaanaa yuktisangat nahin
 Of course, Kautilya was also a realist like Mekiavali and was not merely a follower of idealism
 parantu yah kahana ki kautilya ne dharm yaa naitikta ko sarvatha tilanjali de di thi, satyata ke vipareet hoga
 Kautilya established itself in the first tribunal of 'arthashastra'; arthath- raja praja ko apane dharm se chyut na hone de
 The king should also conduct his religion
 jo raja apane dharm kaa is bhaanti aacharan karata he, vah is lok or paralok main sukhi rahata he
