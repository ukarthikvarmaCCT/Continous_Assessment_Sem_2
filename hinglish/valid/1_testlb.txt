 unhone mutthi bhar vaigyanikon kii sahaayta se march 1944 main nabhikeey urja par anusandhan armbh kiya
 He started working in nuclear science when the knowledge of unconnected chain reactions was negligible and no one was willing to accept the idea of power generation from nuclear power
 unhen 'architect of indian atomic energy program' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Bhabha was born into an elite Parsi family in Mumbai
 unki kirti saare sansar main faili
 On his return to India he continued his research

 san 1934 main cambridge vishvavidhyalay se unhone doctorat kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 In Germany, he conducted studies and experiments on cosmic rays
 haalanki ejineering padhane kaa nirnay unka nahin tha
 It was the desire of the family to become a promising engineer
 homi ne sabaki baton kaa dhyaan rakhte hue, ejineering kii padhai jarur kii, lekin apane priy vishay physics se bhi khud ko jode rakhaa
 His passion for nuclear physics was down to obsessive levels
 unhone cambridge se hi pita ko patr likh kar apane iraade bataa die the ki physics hi unka antim lakshya he
 When the country became independent, Homi Jahangir Bhabha appealed to Indian scientists working across the world to return to India
 unki apil kaa asar hua or kuch vaigyanik bharat laute bhi
 One of them was Homi Nausherwanji Sethna, who worked at the Imperial Chemical Company of Manchester
 america kii michigan uniwarsity se post grajuation karne vaale sethna main bhabha ko kaaphi sambhaavnaaen dikhaai deen

 yah kaarykram mul rup se dow bhabha kii hi dein tha, lekin yah sethna hi the, jinaki vajah se dow bhabha ke nidhan ke baavjood na to yah kaarykram rukaa or na hi isamen koi baadha ai
 The result of his passion was that in 1974 Sethna told the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that he had completed preparations for a peaceful nuclear explosion
 yah bhi poocha ki kya ve is system ko shuru kar sakate hai? iske saath hi unhone yah bhi bataa diya ki ek baar system shuru hone ke baad ise rokna sambhav nahin hoga, aise main agar ve manaa kar dengi to use nahin suna ja sakegaa kyonki tab visphot hokar hi rahegaa
 Preparations started as soon as Indira Gandhi got the green signal
 agle hi din, 18 may ko sethna ne code verde main indira gandhi ko sandesh bheja- buddha muskaraae
 This nuclear explosion of India was so secret
 dow homi bhabha ne dow sethna ko bharat lautne ke baad bahut soch-samaj kar kerala ke alwaaye sthit indian rer arths limited kaa pramukh banaaya tha, jahaan unhane monozite ret se durlabh nabhikeey padaartho ke ansh nikaale

 His tireless efforts and skillful leadership enabled the construction of the first plant to isolate plutonium at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in 1959
 iske dizin or nirmaan kaa puraa kaam bhartiya vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron ne hi kiya
 It is noteworthy that later on, a nuclear device was prepared from plutonium isolated in the same plant, which exploded in Buddha Pokhran on May 18, 1974
 dow sethna ke maargdarshan main hi 1967 main jaadooguda se uranium hasil karne kaa sanyantr laga
 Dr
 Sethna also developed alloy-oxide fuel as an alternative to uranium fuel for nuclear reactors at Tarapur
 pokharan main parmaanu visphot ke baad america ne uranium kii aapurti par roak laga di thi, haalanki ye riactor america nirmit hi the
 May it be well of France that he helped us by giving uranium at a time, otherwise Dr
 Sethna had prepared to run the nuclear reactor of Tarapur with alloy-oxide

 The Atomic Energy Commission was established in India under the leadership of Dr
 Bhabha

 Not only this, Dr

 pehle teen idi pin, jo unamem se kisi ek yaa adhik ko ground tak le jane ke liye pratirohak se jude hote hai, saat monitor prakaaron tak ko paribhaashit karne main sakasham banaate hai or sabhi khule hote hai, no conection) - arthath "koi monitor nahin"
 haalanki, keval teen prakaar ke monitor ko paribhaashit kiya gaya - 1024*768, ensi, jiendi ) se kam ke rijolushan vaala monocrome monitor, 1024*768 se kam ke rijolushan vaala rangeen monitor or 1024*768, jiendi, ensi ) ke rijolushan vaala rangeen monitor
 pin idi3 upyograhit thi
 DDC changed the purpose of these pins to include serial link interfaces
 didisi1 ek saadhaaran, kam gati vaala, ekaladishaatmak kramik link protocol he
 Pin 12 acts as an ID1 data line that continuously transmits the 128-byte EDID block and the data clock has been synchronized to a vertical sync providing a normal clock rate of 60 to 100 Hz
 is protocol ko keval kuch hi disple upkarnon main karyanvit kiya gaya tha
 The most common version is DDC2B which is based on I2C, the serial bus
 vijie sanyojak kii pin 12, idi1 kaa prayog ab ai2si bas kii data pin ke rup main kiya jaataa he or purv kii aprayukt pin 15 ai2si clock ban gayi he; purv main yantric kunjee ke rup main upyog hone vaali pin 9, iipirome ko chalaane ke liye 50 eme tak +5ve disi kii aapurti karti thi, isse host ko monitor band hone par bhi idiaidi padhane kii anumati milti he
 Although I2C is fully bidirectional and supports many bus-masters, DDC2B is unidirectional and allows only one bus master - the graphic adapter
 The monitor 7-bit I2C address acts as a control device at 50 h and provides 128–256 bytes of read-only EDID
 chunki is tak pahunch hameshaa padhane tak hi simit he, isliye pratham ai2si octate hameshaa e1ech hi hota he
 DDC2AB is an implementation of the i2c-based 100 kbit / s access
bus, which enables monitor manufacturers to support external access
bus devices such as a mouse or keyboard; These types of devices and monitors were available in the mid-1990s, but disappeared after the arrival of USB
 didisi2bi+ or didisi2biai, didisi2abi ke nichle sanskaran hai, jo keval monitor or graphics card upkarnon kaa hi samarthan karne ke baavjood bhi inke bich ke dwidishaatmak sanchaar kii anumati pradaan karte hai
 DDC2 is not exclusive to VGA connectors because both DVI and HDMI connectors have dedicated DDC2B wires
 didisi / siai maanak ko agast 1998 main pesh kiya gaya tha
 It provides a means for the computer to transmit commands to the monitor as well as to receive sensor data from the monitor over a two-way link
 monitor ko niyantrit karne ke liye vishisht commands ko sitambar 1998 main relies kiye gaye ek pruthak monitor control cmand set ) maanak sanskaran 1
0 main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Many times the DDC / CI monitor is provided with an external color sensor, to automatically check the color control of the monitor
 kuch jhukaav vaale didisi / siai monitor ek auto-pivat pranali kaa samarthan karte hai, jahaan monitor main uplabdh ek ghurnan sensor monitor ko portret yaa landscape sthitiyon main ghumaae jane par, oparating system ko disple ko sidhaa rakhane main sakasham banaata he
 The DDC / CI standard describes the full suite of two-way control protocols - DDC2AB, DDC2ABI and DDC2AB + - under a single standard and provides a means of packaging the monitor control command set commands
 didisi / siai sanskaran 1

 unnat disple data channel ) didisi maanak kaa sabase nayaa sanskaran he
 Version 1 was introduced in September 1999 and added a segment pointer, which allowed storage of up to 32 kilobytes of display information used by the Advanced EDID) standard
 praarambhik didisi karyanvayan monitor main idiaidi memory ke saath sanchaar karte samay saadhaaran 8-bit data ofaset kaa prayog karte the, jisase sangrahan aakaar 28 bits = 256 bits tak simit rahata tha lekin saste 2 kebi iipirome kaa prayog karnaa sambhav hota tha
 In e-ddc, a special I2C addressing scheme was introduced in which several 256 byte segments could be selected
 aisa karne ke liye, ek 8 bit khand suchakank ko ai2si adress 30ech ke madhyam se disple tak paarit kiya jaataa he
 Is limited to the first I2C octet will always be 60 h)
 The data from the selected segment is then read immediately from the regular DDC2 address using a repeated I2C 'START' signal
 haalanki, viiese vinirdesh khand suchakank ke maan kii seemaa ko 00ech se 7effech ke rup main paribhaashit karata he, atah yah keval 128 segment * 256 bits = 32 kebi kii adressing kii hi anumati detaa he
 The segment index register is variable, which is zero by default, and is automatically set to zero after each NACK and STOP
 atah, pratham 256 bit ke upar prayek baar data ko acces karte samay ise set kar lenaa chahie
 The auto reset mechanism is intended to provide inverse compatibility for DDC2B hosts, otherwise they may be stuck in a segment other than 00H under certain conditions

 disambar 2007 ko apanaaye gaye i-didisi sanskaran 1
2 main displeport or displeidi maanakon ke liye samarthan ko pesh kiya gaya tha
 Some KVM switches and video expanders handle DDC traffic incorrectly, which makes it necessary to deactivate the plug and play properties of the monitor in the operating system, and even analog to connect such devices to multiple computers at times
 Pin 12 may also have to be physically removed from VGA wires
 microsoft windos ek maanak "plag and play monitor" driver pradaan karata he, jo samarthit monitor vidhiyon kii suchi kaa nirmaan karne ke liye disple kii idiaidi soochna kaa prayog karata he

 This rebellion lasted for two years in different regions of India
 is vidroh kaa aarambh chhavnee kshetron main choti jhadpon tathaa aagjanee se hua tha parantu janvari maas tak isane ek bada rup le liya
 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years
 east india company ne robert clive ke netritv main san 1757 main plasi kaa yuddh jeeta
 In the post-war treaty, the British got the right to tax-free trade in Bengal
 san 1764 main baxur kaa yuddh jeetne ke baad angrejon kaa bengal par puri tarah se adhikaar ho gaya
 The victory in these two wars greatly increased the strength of the British and proved their military capability superior to the traditional Indian military capability
 company ne iske baad saare bharat par apana prabhaav failaana aarambh kar diya
 In 1843, the East India Company took possession of the Sindh region after a bloody battle

 san 1857 ke vidroh ke vibhinn rajnatik, aarthik, dharmik, sainik tathaa saamaajik kaaran bataaye jate he Many historians believe that there was a belief in the public at that time that the British want to Christianize them by force or deception
 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses
 lord dalhousie kii rajya hadapney kii naati ke antargat anek rajya jaise jhansi, avadh, satara, nagpur or sambalpur ko angreji rajya main mila liya gaya or inke uttaradhikari raja se angreji rajya se pension paane vaale karmchaaree ban gayi
 The royal families, zamindars and armies found themselves unemployed and marginalized

 The British judicial system was considered unjust to Indians
 san 1853 main britain ke pradhanmantri lord abradin ne prashasnic seva ko bharatiyon ke liye khol diya parantu kuch prabud bharatiyon ke hisaab se yah sudhaar paryaapt nahin tha
 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse
 san 1813 main company ne ek tarafa mukt vyapaar kii niti apana lee iske antargat britani vyapaariyon ko aayaat karne kii puri chhot mil gayi, paramparaagat takanic se bani hui bhartiya vasteen iske saamne tik nahin saki or bhartiya shahari hastshilp vyapaar ko acolpaneey kshati hui
 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe
 parmparik udyogon ke nasht hone or saath saath aadhunik udyogon kaa vikaas na hone kii kaaran yah sthiti or bhi visham ho gayi
 The general public has no means other than farming
 kheti karne vaale kisaano kii haalat bhi kharaab thi
 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company
 san 1849 main lard dalhoji kii ghoshnaa ke anusaar bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari ko aitihaasik laal kila chhodana padega or shahar ke baahar janaa hoga or san 1856 main lard cannig kii ghoshnaa ki bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari raja nahin kahalaayenge ne mughalon ko company ke vidroh main khada kar diya
 The soldiers were originally soldiers of Indian origin who worked in the company's Bengal Army
 bombay, madras or bengal presidensi kii apni alag sena or senapramukh hota tha
 This army had more soldiers than the British army
 san 1857 main is sena main 2,57,000 sipaahi the

 parantu bengal presidensi kii sena main bhartee hone vaale sainik mukhyat: avadh or ganga ke maidani ilaako ke bhoomihaar brahman or rajput the
 In the early years of the company, caste privileges and customs were given importance in the Bengal Army, but after 1840, after the coming of modern government in Calcutta, there was a fear of losing the caste among the soldiers
 sena main sipaahiyon ko jati or dharm se sambandhit chinh pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya
 In 1856, under an order, all newly recruited soldiers were made mandatory to work abroad for some time 
 sipaahi dhire-dhire sena ke jivan ke vibhinn pahaluon se asantusht ho chuke the
 The salary of the army was low

 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old
 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun
